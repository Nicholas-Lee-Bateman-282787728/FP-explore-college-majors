Sometimes it's a pay off, but at other times it is a letdown.  In pace, they are snappy enough, but in song and in dialogue, they don't add much quality to the overall movie experience.  There are some pretty dull lines and some lame lyrics when you listen carefully to both the words and songs.  Still, the characterization (including voices from the likes of Zac Efron and Betty White) are endearing, and the vibrant, flowing visuals make this 'Lorax' good enough for at least viewing once.",3,"""Just One Look"":  A Mixed Exchange for the Big and Little Screens",1347062400,"09 8, 2012",2012,608,"['animation', 'plot', 'rhyme', 'song', 'Lorax', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'elaborated', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'book', 'pay', 'off', 'other', 'times', 'letdown', 'pace', 'are', 'snappy', 'enough', 'song', 'dialogue', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'much', 'quality', 'overall', 'movie', 'experience', 'are', 'pretty', 'dull', 'lines', 'lame', 'lyrics', 'when', 'listen', 'carefully', 'words', 'songs', 'Still', 'characterization', 'including', 'voices', 'likes', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'Betty', 'White', 'are', 'endearing', 'vibrant', 'flowing', 'visuals', 'make', ""'Lorax"", 'good', 'enough', 'least', 'viewing', 'once']",N/A

1468540,A3EZEP0FX5BC1P,B005LAIH4A,"A Conrad ""Ask Conrad""","[3, 4]","Review ofDr. Seuss' The Lorax Combo Pack(Two Discs: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)I preordered this movie set a while ago, with the expected delivery date by August 7 (as advertised).  The movie discs arrived today (August 7) as promised.  Thank you, Amazon, for keeping your word.I was pleasantly surprised that the packaging was a standard bubble-lined envelope, instead of a medium/large box like the days of old.  Less packaging, less materials to have to send out for recycling (in the true spirit of the movie's ""save the planet"" theme).I purchased the set that included blue-ray + DVD + digital copy + Ultraviolet access.  As soon as I received the text message that it was delivered, I came home to watch the movie again with my daughter.  She was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this movie, so suffice it to say that her hum drum summer day was instantly made by the opening of this package.The blu-ray movie clearly shows the intricacy of the animation.  My daughter watches the DVD on her portable DVD player.  The digital copy is accessible to my HTPC (home theater PC) so that we can watch the movie from almost anywhere at home.  In addition, the ultraviolet copy allows you to keep a copy in the cloud, and to stream from any computer, iPad/tablet, iPhone, and more.  So we're good to go.There are three new mini-movies included in the combo disc pack (""Wagon-ho,"" ""Forces of Nature,"" and ""Serenade"").  These are available on both the blu-ray and DVD.  Also included are:-The Making of the Mini-Movies-Deleted Scenes-Seuss to Scene-Once-ler's Wagon-Games-Sing-Along... and other things we haven't tried.I initially thought the the DVD has the feature film + a few bonus features, and that no mini-movies are included on the DVD disc.  It turns out that the DVD in this combo pack also includes the mini-movies, as well as the other bonus features (the making of the ""mini-movies"" and other bonus features that are also included in the blu-ray disc).  It is possible that the 1-disc version (DVD only) only contains the feature film + bonus features, with no mini-movies included.  I did not get the 1-disc (DVD only) version, so I cannot attest to this.The movie itself has been reviewed by many others here, so I will include a movie review with a later update.  For now, I will keep this review on the packaging and discs.Yes, the movie follows the theme from the Dr. Seuss book, plus more.  Drop in the bucket... save the world one tree at a time... don't waste precious resources... any situation can be made into a song and dance number.  Take your pick.  I don't really care much for the songs, none of which I could remember even after watching the movie in the theaters.  Or maybe it's just me.""A 12-year-old boy searches for the one thing that will enable him to win the affection of the girl of his dreams. To find it he must discover the story of the Lorax, the grumpy yet charming creature who fights to protect his world.""  IMDB summary.The character voice overs are made up of an all-star cast, consisting of Danny Devito (The Lorax), Ed Helms (The Once-Ler), Zac Efron (Ted), Taylor Swift (Audrey), and Betty White (Grammy Norma).  It is an interesting take on the story, but I was slightly disappointed with many of the book interpretation.  Oh well.Probably the most relevant line from this story is the most appropriate in this day and age:""Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,nothing is going to get better.

1468567,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B005LAIH4A,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","I kind of loved `Horton Hears a Who'.  It was fun and exciting and beautifully colored, and the moral and slight nod to deeper things (like belief in God) was expertly played to not be preachy but inspiring.  With that hanging over my head, I was really excited to see what `The Lorax' had to offer.  Being Seuss's ode to nature preservation, I had actually never read the book, but the movie looked cute and charming and so I wanted to see it.It was cute and charming, but little else.The film tells the story of young Ted living in Thneedville, a town made completely of plastic that has no natural growth and an atmosphere so dire the townsfolk are forced to buy bottled air by a zillionaire who keeps a close watch on the town to make sure that no one interferes with his money-making schemes.  The thing is, the town is perfectly ok with their manufactured lives and never bats an eyelash at the problems they seem to be facing.  Ted is in love with Audrey, who dreams of trees, and so he makes it his goal to find her one.  With the help of his crazy grandmother, Ted travels outside the city walls and meets the Once-ler who informs him of how Thneedville got its start and what Ted needs to do to save it from itself.He has to plant a seed.The color palate is pleasant, the jokes are plenty and the musical numbers are snappy and yet at the end of it all I felt like `The Lorax' was somewhat stagnant in its message.  The situation in Thneedville was too boisterous to warrant change and I found that the ending seemed almost out of nowhere, with people realizing that nature was important.  It just didn't feel like it ever really explained to us or even showed us why this was such a big deal.  I understand why it was, and I totally understand the importance of preserving nature, but I just didn't feel like `The Lorax' represented that properly.  The story told was interesting and funny and cute and overall very entertaining, but it didn't say all that it intended to, at least not in my opinion.  Still, I recommend it to families because it will entertain the entire family.",4,"Knock, knock...",1356912000,"12 31, 2012",2012,2091,"['kind', 'loved', 'Horton', 'Who', 'was', 'fun', 'exciting', 'beautifully', 'colored', 'moral', 'slight', 'nod', 'deeper', 'things', 'belief', 'God', 'was', 'expertly', 'played', 'not', 'be', 'preachy', 'inspiring', 'hanging', 'head', 'was', 'really', 'excited', 'see', 'what', 'Lorax', 'had', 'offer', 'Being', 'Seuss', 'ode', 'nature', 'preservation', 'had', 'actually', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'movie', 'looked', 'cute', 'charming', 'so', 'wanted', 'see', 'it.It', 'was', 'cute', 'charming', 'little', 'else.The', 'film', 'story', 'young', 'Ted', 'living', 'Thneedville', 'town', 'made', 'completely', 'plastic', 'natural', 'growth', 'atmosphere', 'so', 'dire', 'townsfolk', 'are', 'forced', 'buy', 'bottled', 'air', 'zillionaire', 'who', 'close', 'watch', 'town', 'make', 'sure', 'one', 'money-making', 'schemes', 'thing', 'town', 'perfectly', 'ok', 'manufactured', 'lives', 'never', 'bats', 'eyelash', 'problems', 'seem', 'be', 'facing', 'Ted', 'love', 'Audrey', 'who', 'trees', 'so', 'goal', 'find', 'one', 'help', 'crazy', 'grandmother', 'Ted', 'travels', 'city', 'walls', 'Once-ler', 'who', 'how', 'Thneedville', 'got', 'start', 'what', 'Ted', 'do', 'save', 'itself.He', 'plant', 'seed.The', 'color', 'palate', 'pleasant', 'jokes', 'are', 'plenty', 'musical', 'numbers', 'are', 'snappy', 'yet', 'end', 'felt', 'Lorax', 'was', 'somewhat', 'stagnant', 'message', 'situation', 'Thneedville', 'was', 'too', 'boisterous', 'warrant', 'change', 'found', 'ending', 'seemed', 'almost', 'nowhere', 'people', 'realizing', 'nature', 'was', 'important', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'ever', 'really', 'explained', 'even', 'showed', 'why', 'was', 'such', 'big', 'deal', 'understand', 'why', 'was', 'totally', 'understand', 'importance', 'preserving', 'nature', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Lorax', 'represented', 'properly', 'story', 'told', 'was', 'interesting', 'funny', 'cute', 'overall', 'very', 'entertaining', 'did', ""n't"", 'say', 'intended', 'least', 'not', 'opinion', 'Still', 'recommend', 'families', 'will', 'entertain', 'entire', 'family']",N/A

1468573,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B005LAIH4A,Anthony L.,"[1, 1]","When it comes to children's films, I'm a hard man to please.If I was going by my rating I would give this film 3 stars, since it does not just hit you over the head with it's overtly environmental message so much as beat you unconscious with it. Then it stands over your prostate body and sings Taylor Swift songs as it bludgeons you to death. Even as your last breath escapes your lips, it reminds you to save the trees in the cheesiest, most blindingly in-your-face way.OK. Rant over. I promise.The fact is, The Lorax is a success. Why? Kids love it! And that's all there is to it. My younger brothers and sisters will watch this any time it comes on. The movie successfully captures the whimsy and wit of Dr. Seuss, without veering into weird territory (Horton Hears a Who). The visuals are bright and colorful, the songs are catchy and fun, and the characters are Seuss-y and funny. The voice work is excellent. Best, the humour is funny and constant without being crude or stupid. So for that, I say Dr. Seuss's The Lorax (overtly obvious environmental message aside) is a WIN. 4 Stars!Yay. You've had your fun and games. Let's get down to more serious topics.Does this film have a far, far darker, more hideous message? I think The Lorax is better seen, not as a whimsical children's musical, but as a chilling, Gilliam-esque dystopia. Oh yes...let me show you what I am talking about.This is the way I see The Lorax:A young, enterprising man wanders the world in search of his calling. He ventures upon a pristine utopian valley where nature lives in harmony. He then proceeds to tear down and destroy everything that is good in that valley in the name of industry. He forms a bond with a mythical beast called the Lorax, whom he betrays and stabs in the back.The man becomes a billionaire through every one of the dirtiest tricks in the book. But when a global fuel crisis forces the man to halt his empire of industry, every living thing in the valley is forced to leave their home. They are never seen again. The man's global empire collapses, leaving him destitute and impoverished. He takes to a cottage, where he is never seen again for many years.Another young man sees his chance, and this is where it really gets disturbing. So far this story has had maybe a bit of Scarface in it - the rise and fall of an icon. It's a typical by-the-numbers sci-fi. But it's about to get a whole lot weirder.Fast-forward 50 years. Everybody is abnormally happy. They break into song, and, at times, the whole city knows the lyrics, suggesting perhaps a collective-thought transmitter. Or a lot of brainwashing. You see, this idyllic paradise slowly comes apart to reveal something unbelievably hideous. The people seem oblivious to their problems - children glowing green with radiation poisoning, terrible traffic accidents, and dangerous and daring underground rebels.The young man - now perhaps in his 70's (I deduce this by the fact that everyone - even people in their 50's have never seen trees, which makes the man at least 20 years older) looks unchanged through some radical plastic surgery, perhaps. He has trapped every known human being on the earth inside a walled city, where he feeds them bottled air. What else does he put in the air? How come nobody knows the truth?Commence a rebellion led by a young girl, a love-stricken boy who will do anything for that girl, an aged grandmother, and the ax-wielding former billionaire, that will strike the very foundations of the established order....How's THAT for original? Anyways, The Lorax is a great kids movie that will keep them entertained and, hopefully, inform them that all life on Earth is precious. The critic in me wants to rate this film 3 stars or lower, but I do not think this is a film FOR critics. It's for the kids. And that is where it succeeds.4 Stars!",4,"A chilling, disturbing sci-fi thriller.

Last night my wife, 13 yr old daughter, and I caught ""The Lorax"" on DVD.As the movie started I sat back and my immediate thought was that this is just Dr. Seuss-ian eye candy for little kids - a Hollywoodized version of Dr. Seuss' book of the same name.  And to be completely frank, I didn't quite know how the producers were going to make a full length feature out of ""The Lorax"".There are plenty of cute animals, an idealized vision of nature...and that put me off a bit at first.  As the story developed it soon became clear that the people of Thneedville were living in a dystopian society driven and monitored by a corporate entity...sort of a Big Brother is watching scenario where the Big Brother scenario exists solely to protect corporate interests and short-term profits, mainly for the people (in this case, person) at the top.  There were messages of elimination of personal privacy, misleading the general population for the corporate good, etc.I also enjoyed the character development and threaded story lines.The background story is told by ""The Once-ler"" in flashback mode, and sets the stage for the significance of the movie.  It's a tale of a good person being blinded by personal ambition and  greed, followed by over-harvesting to produce a luxury item for which an artificial need was generated by popular demand, followed by over production at the expense of environmental health, and then economic of the company when resources become depleted, and ecological crash of the environment needed to provide even basic services, like photosynthesis, for us and all living things.I was thoroughly unamused when the head of Thneedville's main corporation responds to scientific information - the suggestion that trees produce clean air by photosythesis - with obvious disdain and blind outright dismissal as something made up, a hoax? (Sound familiar to anything happening today?).OK, here's the bottom line.  If you are a promoter/supported of completely unregulated free-enterprise-at-all-costs-capitalism you will hate this movie.  If, however, you are concerned about the state of the environment and the way we are managing/mismanaging it, and realize the need for a change then this movie will not only strike a chord with you, it will hit you as being highly significant and you will recommend it highly to everyone you can get to watch it.In summary, this movie is actually a thesis on the current state of business, economy, and the environment in the United States.

You can see the everything so clearly and I can't imagine how the animators even captured all those details.  The voices made my husband and I laugh as they are from popular actors/actresses including Taylor Swift, Zac Efron, Danny Devito and Betty White.The story is actually quite moving too and was perfect for me to introduce some lessons to my children.  ""The Lorax"" is a tale of a young man, the Once-ler, who goes off on his in search for the perfect material to make his Thneed (a crazy sweater.)  He meets the Lorax when he cuts down a tree and the Lorax explains how he speaks for the trees and takes care of the animals.  The story goes on of course as he cuts down more trees until there is none left.  As a side story there is a town in the future where there are no trees but one girl (Taylor Swift) wants one.  They actually sell bottled air since the air and pollution is so bad!So anyways a young boy (Zac Efron) goes on a mission and hears the story from the Once-ler.  Can he grow a tree and save the town?The story is great to teach kids about caring about the environment, recycling, and how one person can make a difference!This is a must-see movie in my book, even if you don't have kids!

1468616,A1BGE3EXIJ42XA,B005LAIH4A,"Chris ""Okie""","[1, 2]","As a kid, The Lorax was one of my favorite Dr. Seuss stories.  Not only did I enjoy the storytelling, but I also had a lot of fun watching the animated version based on the book.  One thing to remember about the animated Dr. Seuss of the 70s is that they were very faithful representations of the book.  They used the same art as the book and the script was very often an exact reading of the book text.I recently watched the 2012 updated version with my kids.  Even from the preview I could tell that the movie makers were taking some definite liberties with the story.  I didn't expect any major departures from the story, but it was clear that they would be adding considerable content into the ""gaps"" of the story.  NOTE: I'm going to be going over some of the additions to the story.  I assume that you're already familiar with the original book, so I don't claim any ""spoilers"" for that story, but if you want to be surprised, just skip to the end here for my overall opinion without risking spoiling any plot points for you.The movie gives a full storyline and family to the boy who goes to visit the Once-ler.  In the book, the boy is present on the periphery and is given a challenge at the end of the book but in the movie the boy becomes a central character named Ted.  Ted lives in ""Thneed-Ville"" named after the Thneeds invented by the Once-ler years ago.  Thneed-ville is a sort of plastic-mechanical city where all needs and recreation are provided by artificial man-made means and on the whole there is no real concept of ""nature"" or ""natural"" elements.  In fact, the current Mayor of Thneed-Ville makes his living by selling containers of clean air to the citizens.Ted has a crush on a girl in the town and learns that she has a dream to see a real living tree (rather than the plastic and metal imitations around town).  Ted learns about the Once-ler and decides to go outside of town to visit him.  Outside of town is a deserted wasteland still suffering the consequences of the Once-ler's industrial ravaging of the area.  He works his way through some strange booby traps to get to chat with the Once-ler.  Rather than having the Once-ler tell his entire story in one sitting (as seems to be the case in the book), Ted has to come back a few different times and each time, he has different obstacles in his way.As for the Once-ler's story, it also had some new elements added.  We get to know his family more in depth and they are quite the set of characters.  We spend quite a while with the Once-ler before he becomes a mega greedy corporate millionaire.  We actually see the Once-ler and the Lorax build up quite the relationship, which is interesting.During the Once-ler's story, we also get to know the Lorax in a more personal way than in the book.  This is a lot of fun, but I felt like it came a little at the expense of some of the aspects of the Lorax's personality from the book.  I felt like Danny DeVito did a great job voicing the Lorax.  But I missed some of his quirky rhyming couplets and behavior.  I also missed some of the songs and music from the previous movie.  There were songs in this one but they were rather different in scope and tone.One very interesting addition is that this movie continues on AFTER the story from the book ends.  We get to see what happens after the Once-ler gives Ted the challenge of ""Unless.""  The ending sequence of the movie includes vehicle chases, confrontations with big baddies and overcoming high odds in search of a higher goal.  Where the book left the action in the hands of the reader (or viewer), this movie explicitly drives home the resolution that should be taken.Overall, I still really enjoyed the story of the Lorax and had fun with this movie.  I didn't see it in 3D but it was very evident which scenes were specifically built to try and take advantage of the 3D ins and outs.  There were a number of things I nostalgically missed from the book and 1970s movie, but generally this was true to the nature of the story.  I had fun with some of the additions to the story though I could have done without a lot of them.  The kids really enjoyed the movie.  I'm not sure if they've seen the old one recently enough to remember it and I'm not sure the last time I'd read the book with them (or that they read it on their own).  I'll have to encourage them to do so.Generally, this was a fun movie.  If you're a fan of the Lorax, you should enjoy it.  If you're a fan of kids movies, you should have fun as well...there's good animation and solid kid humor.  If you're a die-hard purist when it comes to Dr. Seuss, you may be a little disappointed at the changes made.***3 out of 5 stars",3,A fun update but left me missing the old version,1346976000,"09 7, 2012",2012,4674,"['kid', 'Lorax', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'stories', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'enjoy', 'storytelling', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'watching', 'animated', 'version', 'based', 'book', 'One', 'thing', 'remember', 'animated', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', '70s', 'were', 'very', 'faithful', 'representations', 'book', 'used', 'same', 'art', 'book', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'often', 'exact', 'reading', 'book', 'text.I', 'recently', 'watched', '2012', 'updated', 'version', 'kids', 'Even', 'preview', 'could', 'tell', 'movie', 'makers', 'were', 'taking', 'definite', 'liberties', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'major', 'departures', 'story', 'was', 'clear', 'would', 'be', 'adding', 'considerable', 'content', 'gaps', 'story', 'NOTE', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'going', 'additions', 'story', 'assume', ""'re"", 'already', 'familiar', 'original', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'claim', 'spoilers', 'story', 'want', 'be', 'surprised', 'just', 'skip', 'end', 'here', 'overall', 'opinion', 'risking', 'spoiling', 'plot', 'points', 'you.The', 'movie', 'full', 'storyline', 'family', 'boy', 'who', 'visit', 'Once-ler', 'book', 'boy', 'present', 'periphery', 'given', 'challenge', 'end', 'book', 'movie', 'boy', 'central', 'character', 'named', 'Ted', 'Ted', 'Thneed-Ville', 'named', 'Thneeds', 'invented', 'Once-ler', 'years', 'ago', 'Thneed-ville', 'sort', 'plastic-mechanical', 'city', 'where', 'needs', 'recreation', 'are', 'provided', 'artificial', 'man-made', 'means', 'whole', 'real', 'concept', 'nature', 'natural', 'elements', 'fact', 'current', 'Mayor', 'Thneed-Ville', 'living', 'selling', 'containers', 'clean', 'air', 'citizens.Ted', 'crush', 'girl', 'town', 'dream', 'see', 'real', 'living', 'tree', 'rather', 'plastic', 'metal', 'imitations', 'town', 'Ted', 'Once-ler', 'decides', 'go', 'town', 'visit', 'town', 'deserted', 'wasteland', 'still', 'suffering', 'consequences', 'Once-ler', 'industrial', 'ravaging', 'area', 'way', 'strange', 'booby', 'traps', 'get', 'chat', 'Once-ler', 'Rather', 'having', 'Once-ler', 'tell', 'entire', 'story', 'one', 'sitting', 'be', 'case', 'book', 'Ted', 'come', 'back', 'few', 'different', 'times', 'time', 'different', 'obstacles', 'way.As', 'Once-ler', 'story', 'also', 'had', 'new', 'elements', 'added', 'get', 'know', 'family', 'more', 'depth', 'are', 'quite', 'set', 'characters', 'spend', 'quite', 'while', 'Once-ler', 'mega', 'greedy', 'corporate', 'millionaire', 'actually', 'see', 'Once-ler', 'Lorax', 'build', 'up', 'quite', 'relationship', 'interesting.During', 'Once-ler', 'story', 'also', 'get', 'know', 'Lorax', 'more', 'personal', 'way', 'book', 'lot', 'fun', 'felt', 'came', 'little', 'expense', 'aspects', 'Lorax', 'personality', 'book', 'felt', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'voicing', 'Lorax', 'missed', 'quirky', 'rhyming', 'couplets', 'behavior', 'also', 'missed', 'songs', 'music', 'previous', 'movie', 'were', 'songs', 'one', 'were', 'rather', 'different', 'scope', 'tone.One', 'very', 'interesting', 'addition', 'movie', 'AFTER', 'story', 'book', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'Once-ler', 'Ted', 'challenge', 'Unless', 'ending', 'sequence', 'movie', 'vehicle', 'chases', 'confrontations', 'big', 'baddies', 'overcoming', 'high', 'odds', 'search', 'higher', 'goal', 'Where', 'book', 'left', 'action', 'hands', 'reader', 'viewer', 'movie', 'explicitly', 'home', 'resolution', 'should', 'be', 'taken.Overall', 'still', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'Lorax', 'had', 'fun', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', '3D', 'was', 'very', 'evident', 'scenes', 'were', 'specifically', 'built', 'try', 'take', 'advantage', '3D', 'ins', 'outs', 'were', 'number', 'things', 'nostalgically', 'missed', 'book', '1970s', 'movie', 'generally', 'was', 'true', 'nature', 'story', 'had', 'fun', 'additions', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'lot', 'kids', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'old', 'one', 'recently', 'enough', 'remember', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'last', 'time', ""'d"", 'read', 'book', 'read', 'own', ""'ll"", 'have', 'encourage', 'do', 'so.Generally', 'was', 'fun', 'movie', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Lorax', 'should', 'enjoy', ""'re"", 'fan', 'kids', 'movies', 'should', 'have', 'fun', 'well', 'good', 'animation', 'solid', 'kid', 'humor', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'purist', 'when', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'disappointed', 'changes', 'made', '***3', '5', 'stars']",N/A

Sometimes I cringed at how heavy-handed they were with Dr. Seuss' simple message, sometimes I was just dismayed by the overabundance of nasty characters they invented and imposed upon his story.  Too many times I wondered where Dr. Seuss was in this messy adaptation of his book.  He seemed to be missing.  The reason for this became clear in the bonus feature.  Apparently, the filmmakers felt it necessary to attach things not Seuss to the story because it was somehow deficient as it was; requiring their extensions.  One of them even had the gall to call it a homage.  But tampering is tampering; clearly they were dissatisfied with most things in the book, especially the notion of having to adapt Seuss' two-dimensional drawings into......two-dimensional drawings in motion.  A lot of work was required to ""make them come alive.""  Again, a slur against Dr. Seuss' work.  If they didn't like the book, why bring it to the screen?  Why add dopey songs that were less than memorable and subvert the plot?  Why ignore the language, what makes Seuss' work so distinctive?

The changes to the plot generally fit the spirit of the original story - with a major exception I'll discuss later. In all, there's a lot going for the Lorax and casual viewers should enjoy it.However, for fans of Dr. Suess' original book, the end result comes across as overly Hollywoodized. The movie imposes a meta-narrative on the original plot in which we learn more about the boy who seeks the Onceler's advice. Much of the meta-narrative works, although I think it does trivialize the environmental message. The boy now goes to seek the Onceler's advice because a girl he has a crush on wants to know more about trees. Even worse, the film has a typical happy ending, which again trivializes the book's environmentalist theme. The book's ambiguous ending leaves the reader concerned about the fate of the environment, whereas the movie allows viewers to forget about the trees once they leave the theater.With so much going for this movie, it's a shame Hollywood chose the easy way out.

1468680,A3BTL4FV6ODKAT,B005LAIH4A,"fredtownward ""The Analytical Mind; Have Brain...","[4, 9]","When Dr. Seuss gets serious, you don't know what you are going to get.  That's because his extremely left-wing views sometimes lead him to the truth, sometimes blind him to the truth, and sometimes just lead him astray.  Thus his story aboutThe Sneetchesstill stands as one of the most effective condemnations of the stupidity of prejudice based upon appearance ever written, andYertle the Turtle and Other Storiescontains three brilliantly effective modern fables.  On the other hand Dr. Seuss' own prejudices (he was an extreme pro-abortionist) made him absolutely horrified to learn that pro-lifers were drawing the obvious conclusion from the moral ofHorton Hears A Who!: ""A person's a person, no matter how small,"" by applying it to unborn children, and despite the avalanche of demands to cease and desist with lawsuits to follow, Dr. Seuss went to his grave knowing that despite his best (or worst) intentions, he had written the unofficial but extremely effective motto of the pro-life movement.  Dr. Seuss' worst book by far isThe Butter Battle Book, but in fairness to him, writing it was an act of sheer desperation.  He probably knew he was dying, and in 1984 his beloved Soviet Union (Dr. Seuss was a Communist sympathizer before being a Communist sympathizer was cool.) was also dying at the hands of President Ronald Reagan who unlike most ""experts"" of all political persuasions believed the Cold War was winnable.  In the end Dr. Seuss failed, Ronald Reagan succeeded, and a lot of kids were forced to read a truly subpar book because their teachers liked its politics.This brings us toThe Lorax, arguably Dr. Seuss' second worst book, not because the message hammered home with a sledgehammer in it was particularly evil, but rather because it was so unnecessary.  Stripped of its dramatics and anti-business bias, the primary message of The Lorax was don't only chop down and never plant the trees you depend on for your business.  Well, DUH!  American logging companies were starting to figure this out in the NINETEENTH Century!  Certainly by the time The Lorax was written, there wasn't an American logging company that wasn't planting several trees for every tree they cut down.  The secondary message was don't carelessly and thoughtlessly pollute the air and the water, and while it took longer for this message to sink in, by 1971 it really had, and the air and water were rapidly being cleaned up.  I did then and I do now have a problem with a children's story that consciously and deliberately pressures small children to solve a problem that their parents have already solved.  What next?  Telling little kids that ""unless"" they care a whole awful lot, enough to do something about it, slavery will never be abolished?Finally, instead of just doing a CG remake of the 1972 version:The Lorax, the creators of this mess decided they could do a better job than Dr. Seuss; the result is something both left-wing and right-wing can take offence at.  Having junked, even made fun of most of Dr. Seuss' beautiful language, they replace it with a lot of questionable humor (the anti-Redneck humor really got old) and slapstick chase scenes.

Some aspects are translated downright marvelously, such as the whimsical trees, the goofy fish, and the cuddly bear folk. They are brought to life in a weird, wonderful world that I imagine Dr. Seuss would be proud of. Though the aspect of colors and vividness cannot rival the splendor of ""Rio"" and ""Finding Nemo"" (the kings of color, when it comes to animated films, IMO), ""The Lorax"" nonetheless manages to be quite impressive at times (my favorite scene was the ""nontraditional"" white water rafting). It's definitely worth watching on Blu-ray, as opposed to DVD (as are almost all animated films), in order to get the most out of its color spectrum and attention to detail.As for the story itself, ""The Lorax"" tells a serviceable tale that is held aloft by the superb voice acting of Ed Helms, who makes up for the less than pleasant contributions of Danny DeVito and Betty White (fine actors, but a rather annoying, cliche-riddled duo for an animated picture). The larger message of environmental conservation has its heart in the right place, although its absurdity (focusing on the renewable resource of trees rather than the limited resource of oil) must be overlooked.

What I love about The Lorax is that it stays pure, aside from the obvious immoral dilemmas, and focuses on good, clean, family entertainment.  As an adult, I always appreciate seeing books from my childhood, or any children's book made into film form, keep their integrity and innocence; After all, they're being made for children, not adults, the innuendo is just offensive. So I was thrilled to see the integrity upheld with this film, Suess would be proud!That said, I love the adaptation itself and how it includes the story while modernizing it to this day and age, creating a problem that could easily happen.  The environmental issue is upon us, and while moviegoers might feel this is a bit shoved down there throat or even like an advocacy film, this is just the way of The Lorax.The vibrancy of the movie is amazing, I just love the colors and contasts of everything. The trees themselves, while looking more like cotton candy on a sick, are beautiful, as is the plastic, modern town itself. The creatures are adorable, and you can't help but fall in love with the cute little bears as they putter around, the fish as they walk on land, and even The Lorax himself as he goes out of his way to annoy and protect.The moral of the story is a strong one, and one that every child needs to watch, hear and hopefully understand.  With the catchy music added, an exciting side plot and crush, most kids won't have a hard time following this at all.This movie happens to be the very one me and my now boyfriend chose for our first date almost a year ago, and we both loved it. We watched it again tonight with my six year old, who objected thinking it was a ""baby movie"", but then she sat through it enthralled and laughing.  It was nice watching it again for us also and remembering that first date, and how the movie teared us both up.

1468720,A1QHW2L0RU54QQ,B005LAIH4A,jeheist,"[0, 4]","Recently watched movie review:*Dr Seuss's The Lorax (2012)- 2/5Dr Seuss's The Lorax is a family friendly, animation film that's based on the book of the same name. Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in a 'real' treeless town called 'Thneedville.' He has a major crush on Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) and will do anything for her attention and love. You see, the town of Thneedville has trees spread throughout the city, but the trees are all fake. Ted finds out that Audrey would get married on the spot if someone were to find a real tree. He asks his grandma (voiced by Betty White) where he can find one. She suggests that he find 'The Once-ler,"" as he might know where to find a real tree. Ted finds The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms), but is asked to listen to a story before finding out where one might be. The Once-ler tells a story of his past, and soon you'll find out why 'The Lorax' (voiced by Danny DeVito) pops out of a tree stump to protect his world.From the same studio (Illumination Entertainment) that created Despicable Me (my favorite movie of 2010), I had hope that The Lorax would be at least a decent film. Unfortunately, I almost had to stop watching it as I was getting very disappointed with the quality of the film. I found that the movie focused too much on 'save the environment' and 'capitalism is bad' messages rather than making a good film. I found the writing to be a mixed bag as sometimes it was good, but then other times is was just plain goofy. I also wasn't a fan of any of the characters, and I have to blame the writing, especially the writing for character 'Ted.' I didn't like anything he had to say and that's a major problem as he's a main character.While I didn't like any of the characters, I did however like the 'animals' instead, except The Lorax; the animals didn't speak, but rather their emotions shined. Just like Despicable Me, Illumination Entertainment knows how to create perfect emotions/animations for their background characters that don't involve people. The animals all look cute and adorable, and I found myself looking forward to seeing what the next animal emotion/animation would be. Illumination Entertainment did a great job with the minions in Despicable Me, and while the minions made the movie, at least that film was backed by awesome writing, and very likable characters.The Lorax looks beautiful with vibrant colors throughout. The animals did a great job with the script, and there are a couple of catchy tunes. Unfortunately, everything else falls flat. Will most young audiences get the messages the film tries to shove down their throats? I'm going to say, no. Will most adults want to watch this more than once? Probably not. Chances are, you're going to watch this movie with your kids, but since there's better family friendly, animated films out there, I have to give Dr Seuss's The Lorax a recommended 'pass.'",2,Recently watched movie review: Dr Seuss's The Lorax (2012),1353628800,"11 23, 2012",2012,2893,"['Recently', 'watched', 'movie', 'review', '*Dr', 'Seuss', 'Lorax', '2012', '2/5Dr', 'Seuss', 'Lorax', 'family', 'friendly', 'animation', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Ted', 'voiced', 'Zac', 'Efron', ""'real"", 'treeless', 'town', 'called', ""'Thneedville"", 'major', 'crush', 'Audrey', 'voiced', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'attention', 'love', 'see', 'town', 'Thneedville', 'trees', 'spread', 'city', 'trees', 'are', 'fake', 'Ted', 'out', 'Audrey', 'would', 'get', 'married', 'spot', 'someone', 'were', 'find', 'real', 'tree', 'grandma', 'voiced', 'Betty', 'White', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'one', 'find', ""'The"", 'Once-ler', 'might', 'know', 'where', 'find', 'real', 'tree', 'Ted', 'Once-ler', 'voiced', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'asked', 'listen', 'story', 'finding', 'out', 'where', 'one', 'might', 'be', 'Once-ler', 'story', 'past', 'soon', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'why', ""'The"", 'Lorax', 'voiced', 'Danny', 'DeVito', 'tree', 'stump', 'protect', 'world.From', 'same', 'studio', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'created', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'favorite', 'movie', '2010', 'had', 'hope', 'Lorax', 'would', 'be', 'least', 'decent', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'almost', 'had', 'stop', 'watching', 'was', 'getting', 'very', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'film', 'found', 'movie', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'environment', ""'capitalism"", 'bad', 'messages', 'rather', 'making', 'good', 'film', 'found', 'writing', 'be', 'mixed', 'bag', 'sometimes', 'was', 'good', 'then', 'other', 'times', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'goofy', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'characters', 'have', 'blame', 'writing', 'especially', 'writing', 'character', ""'Ted"", 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'anything', 'had', 'say', 'major', 'problem', 'main', 'character.While', 'did', ""n't"", 'characters', 'did', 'however', ""'animals"", 'instead', 'Lorax', 'animals', 'did', ""n't"", 'speak', 'rather', 'emotions', 'shined', 'Just', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'how', 'create', 'perfect', 'emotions/animations', 'background', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'involve', 'people', 'animals', 'look', 'cute', 'adorable', 'found', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'next', 'animal', 'emotion/animation', 'would', 'be', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'minions', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'minions', 'made', 'movie', 'least', 'film', 'was', 'backed', 'awesome', 'writing', 'very', 'likable', 'characters.The', 'Lorax', 'beautiful', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'animals', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'script', 'are', 'couple', 'catchy', 'tunes', 'Unfortunately', 'everything', 'else', 'flat', 'Will', 'most', 'young', 'audiences', 'get', 'messages', 'film', 'tries', 'shove', 'down', 'throats', ""'m"", 'going', 'say', 'Will', 'most', 'adults', 'want', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'Probably', 'not', 'Chances', 'are', ""'re"", 'going', 'watch', 'movie', 'kids', 'better', 'family', 'friendly', 'animated', 'films', 'there', 'have', 'give', 'Dr', 'Seuss', 'Lorax', 'recommended', ""'pass""]",N/A

1468764,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B005LAIH4A,Kenya Starflight,"[1, 2]","Why does Hollywood seem to stumble so badly whenever it decides to make a film with an environmental message?  It seems that almost any movie I've seen that tries to have a ""save the Earth"" message comes across as preachy and heavy-handed.  ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" James Cameron's ""Avatar,"" the horrible remake of ""Day the Earth Stood Still""... all of them seem to prefer beating us over the head with environmentalist propoganda over telling a decent story.  There are a few decent ones that manage to balance their message with a well-told story and likable characters (I'll get to those at the end of the review), but for the most part I've seen enough ""save the Earth"" films that favor preaching over quality that I instinctively cringe whenever the issue comes up in a movie.""The Lorax,"" based on one of my favorite Dr. Seuss books growing up, falls into the ""too preachy"" to be enjoyable category, and isn't helped by all the usual suspects when it comes to animated kids' films, especially kids' films based on children's books.The film takes place in Thneedville (a location not in the original book), an over-the-top city where everything is plastic and artificial, including the trees, and the air and water are so badly polluted that a child who goes swimming comes out glow-in-the-dark and the citizens must buy bottled air to live.  Our main character (nameless in the book, called Ted here) decides the best way to impress a girl he likes is to find an extinct, nearly-mythic object called a tree and give it to her.  Following his kooky grandmother's advice, he visits a crotchety recluse called the Once-ler, who tells him the sad story about how he destroyed Thneedville's environment despite the efforts of a guardian creature called the Lorax, and gives him the key to restoring the trees and repairing the damage he did.  The greedy, over-the-top mayor of Thneedville considers Ted's efforts a threat, however, and plots to thwart his plans...The original book is a classic, a bittersweet plea to take better care of our world and take responsibility for our actions.  In my honest opinion, it would have performed much better as a half-hour TV special than as a full-length movie, and padding the story's length with a romantic subplot, cartoony antics, and badly-written musical numbers (seriously, these are some the weakest songs I've heard in an animated movie since ""Quest For Camelot"") just makes it painfully obvious that there wasn't enough story to fill an hour and a half.  When will Hollywood learn that stretching a children's picture book into a feature-length movie rarely works?  (I'm looking at you, ""Polar Express"" and ""Ant Bully..."")The movie has all the attention span of a goldfish, with too-bright colors, characters that never seem to hold still, and an unrelenting pace that never pauses to let the viewer breathe and process what they've seen.  The characters are, with a few exceptions, either bland or just plain annoying.  Said exceptions are Ted's spirited grandmother (voiced quite appropriately by Betty White) and the bombastic mayor, an over-the-top villain who provides the most laughs in the film.  The title character himself suffers the worst, however -- he's reduced to a minor role, with Ted and the mayor hijacking the film, and he goes from a wise guardian character to a cranky wisecracker.  I also felt that Danny Devito's voice did not fit the original character, and that the character was rewritten to fit the actor, when it should have been the other way around.And yes, the film gets incredibly preachy, so much so that it becomes tiresome to watch.  It's possible to make a children's movie that has an environmental message without being terribly heavy-handed about it (such as WALL-E), but ""The Lorax"" manages to miss the mark.  It doesn't help that it was also a merchandise-driven film, which rather goes against its anti-materialistic message.While not an entirely terrible film, neither is this necessarily a good film.  It will entertain young children, I'm sure, but I imagine older children and most adults would quickly grow annoyed with it.  The fact that it butchers and pads out a beloved children's book doesn't help it either.For a better film that manages to carry its environmental message quite well without sacrificing storytelling, I recommend the aforementioned ""WALL-E"" or Miyazaki's ""Castle In the Sky"" or ""Nausicaa: Valley of the Wind.""  Or seek out the 2D animated ""Lorax"" special -- it's more faithful to the book.",2,Annoying and preachy adaptation of a Seuss classic,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,4545,"['Why', 'Hollywood', 'seem', 'stumble', 'so', 'badly', 'whenever', 'make', 'film', 'environmental', 'message', 'almost', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'tries', 'have', 'save', 'Earth', 'message', 'across', 'preachy', 'heavy-handed', 'Ferngully', 'Last', 'Rainforest', 'Day', 'Tomorrow', 'James', 'Cameron', 'Avatar', 'horrible', 'remake', 'Day', 'Earth', 'Stood', 'Still', 'seem', 'prefer', 'beating', 'head', 'environmentalist', 'propoganda', 'telling', 'decent', 'story', 'are', 'few', 'decent', 'ones', 'manage', 'balance', 'message', 'well-told', 'story', 'likable', 'characters', ""'ll"", 'get', 'end', 'review', 'most', 'part', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'save', 'Earth', 'films', 'favor', 'preaching', 'over', 'quality', 'instinctively', 'cringe', 'whenever', 'issue', 'up', 'movie', 'Lorax', 'based', 'one', 'favorite', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'books', 'growing', 'up', 'too', 'preachy', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'category', ""n't"", 'helped', 'usual', 'when', 'animated', 'kids', 'films', 'especially', 'kids', 'films', 'based', 'children', 'books.The', 'film', 'place', 'Thneedville', 'location', 'not', 'original', 'book', 'over-the-top', 'city', 'where', 'everything', 'plastic', 'artificial', 'including', 'trees', 'air', 'water', 'are', 'so', 'badly', 'polluted', 'child', 'who', 'swimming', 'out', 'glow-in-the-dark', 'citizens', 'must', 'buy', 'bottled', 'air', 'live', 'main', 'character', 'nameless', 'book', 'called', 'Ted', 'here', 'best', 'way', 'impress', 'girl', 'find', 'extinct', 'nearly-mythic', 'object', 'called', 'tree', 'give', 'Following', 'kooky', 'grandmother', 'advice', 'crotchety', 'recluse', 'called', 'Once-ler', 'who', 'sad', 'story', 'how', 'destroyed', 'Thneedville', 'environment', 'efforts', 'guardian', 'creature', 'called', 'Lorax', 'key', 'restoring', 'trees', 'repairing', 'damage', 'did', 'greedy', 'over-the-top', 'mayor', 'Thneedville', 'considers', 'Ted', 'efforts', 'threat', 'however', 'plots', 'thwart', 'plans', 'original', 'book', 'classic', 'bittersweet', 'plea', 'take', 'better', 'care', 'world', 'take', 'responsibility', 'actions', 'honest', 'opinion', 'would', 'have', 'performed', 'much', 'better', 'half-hour', 'TV', 'special', 'full-length', 'movie', 'padding', 'story', 'length', 'romantic', 'subplot', 'cartoony', 'antics', 'badly-written', 'musical', 'numbers', 'seriously', 'are', 'weakest', 'songs', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'animated', 'movie', 'Quest', 'Camelot', 'just', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'story', 'fill', 'hour', 'half', 'When', 'will', 'Hollywood', 'learn', 'stretching', 'children', 'picture', 'book', 'feature-length', 'movie', 'rarely', ""'m"", 'looking', 'Polar', 'Express', 'Ant', 'Bully', 'movie', 'attention', 'span', 'goldfish', 'too-bright', 'colors', 'characters', 'never', 'seem', 'hold', 'still', 'unrelenting', 'pace', 'never', 'let', 'viewer', 'breathe', 'process', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'characters', 'are', 'few', 'exceptions', 'bland', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'Said', 'exceptions', 'are', 'Ted', 'spirited', 'grandmother', 'voiced', 'quite', 'appropriately', 'Betty', 'White', 'bombastic', 'mayor', 'over-the-top', 'villain', 'who', 'most', 'laughs', 'film', 'title', 'character', 'worst', 'however', 'reduced', 'minor', 'role', 'Ted', 'mayor', 'hijacking', 'film', 'wise', 'guardian', 'character', 'cranky', 'wisecracker', 'also', 'felt', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'voice', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'original', 'character', 'character', 'was', 'rewritten', 'fit', 'actor', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'other', 'way', 'around.And', 'yes', 'film', 'incredibly', 'preachy', 'so', 'much', 'tiresome', 'watch', 'possible', 'make', 'children', 'movie', 'environmental', 'message', 'being', 'terribly', 'heavy-handed', 'such', 'WALL-E', 'Lorax', 'miss', 'mark', ""n't"", 'help', 'was', 'also', 'merchandise-driven', 'film', 'rather', 'anti-materialistic', 'message.While', 'not', 'entirely', 'terrible', 'film', 'necessarily', 'good', 'film', 'will', 'entertain', 'young', 'children', ""'m"", 'sure', 'imagine', 'older', 'children', 'most', 'adults', 'would', 'quickly', 'grow', 'annoyed', 'fact', 'out', 'beloved', 'children', 'book', ""n't"", 'help', 'either.For', 'better', 'film', 'carry', 'environmental', 'message', 'quite', 'well', 'sacrificing', 'storytelling', 'recommend', 'aforementioned', 'WALL-E', 'Miyazaki', 'Castle', 'Sky', 'Nausicaa', 'Valley', 'Wind', 'seek', 'out', '2D', 'animated', 'Lorax', 'special', 'more', 'faithful', 'book']",N/A

1468777,A356RFKNIG043B,B005LAIH4A,K. Swanson,"[1, 2]","As a serious fan of Theodore Geisel since 1968, I feel confident in saying he would ultimately love this film. Not for how it treats his source material but for how true it is to his world view. For all its flaws, this Lorax says more about what really matters today than any ""toon"" since Wall-E, and goes even further down our modren rabbit hole.Keep in mind that The Lorax was really radical in its time: a children's environmentalist book? It was not universally loved, to say the least. Stick to the cute cat in that cute hat was the consensus from the suits, because the Lorax was getting mighty close to the kinds of truths Those In Charge would rather us not discuss among adults, let alone the kiddos.But that's the secret genius of the best kids' toons and books and movies and tv---they treats kids like their best selves, wise human beings who see things we adults can't begin to because we're so lost in our little ego-driven dramas. Some kids are smart enough to know how lame our society is becoming, and this movie is for them, just as the book was. And for the many many kids who know something's not right with how the grown-ups live, but can't quite elucidate it. Enter the Lorax.As a huge fan of the book, I don't like DeVito as the Lorax. Too predictable and too twee; oh how I'd love to have heard Willem Dafoe instead. Or so many others with more gravitas and less wacky cute in their voice. But oh well. On the other hand Ed Helms is excellent (apart from his rather excruciating singing), and shows why he's heading towards epic star status in his own quiet goofy way. He gets this material and sells it perfectly. As it were...Selling EVERYTHING is what this book is about, and the movie takes that to the next level. Seuss was a visionary and saw the future we now live in, and this flick goes there and farther, into deeper realms of consumer and corporate greed. It baldly and hilariously/painfully exposes our daily selfishness as a society, so focused on our own marketing-driven ""needs"" that we're blind to the real costs that will inevitably bankrupt us, economically and morally, and are in fact making us go broke right now.Let's face the facts, it's only because things are so bad in this country now that this movie could even get made by a major studio. O'Hare Air is a brilliant metaphor for our economy, completely short-sighted greed for profit overriding all common sense. And common decency, which we seem to daily forget, decency towards our planet, the creatures we share it with, and ourselves. This movie really brings that home. And its endless attendant ironies are very entertaining on the meta-ugly level: the garish colors and standard characters and typically meh tunes. But some of the lyrics are cut from another cloth entirely, and it's those moments that make this ""kids' film"" so uniquely subversive. It looks all Diznee until you really pay attention...No doubt the characters could look better: less cutesy, new face-types instead of the soooo predictable rounded snub-nosed cutie-pie faces in all pixar etc stuff now. But then again, that archetypal look helps disguise the truly harsh message this movie and book is sending: WE ARE KILLING OURSELVES AND OUR HOME...MERELY FOR MONEY.Becasue this new Lorax gives undying devotion to that one simple, ugly truth, I forgive this flick all its cliches and flaws, because we desperately need this kind of truth, and fast, from all of our movies and art these days.The message here is WAKE UP, WORLD, this plan ain't working.And that they got this film made, and shipped out in shiny new 3-D thneed containers, is somehow both so perfect and so pathetic that the irony is priceless.Or, 19.99 for a good-looking blu-ray with plenty of entertaining extras to ponder as we whittle  and fiddle away the brief time until we chop our last truffula tree...maybe to print The Lorax?And you know that Ted Geisel, America's best doctor, would laugh heartily, and sadly.",5,Simultaneous cheeze whiz and brilliant subversion,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,3963,"['serious', 'fan', 'Theodore', 'Geisel', '1968', 'feel', 'confident', 'saying', 'would', 'ultimately', 'love', 'film', 'Not', 'how', 'source', 'material', 'how', 'true', 'world', 'view', 'flaws', 'Lorax', 'more', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'today', 'toon', 'Wall-E', 'even', 'further', 'down', 'modren', 'rabbit', 'hole.Keep', 'mind', 'Lorax', 'was', 'really', 'radical', 'time', 'children', 'environmentalist', 'book', 'was', 'not', 'universally', 'loved', 'say', 'least', 'Stick', 'cute', 'cat', 'cute', 'was', 'consensus', 'suits', 'Lorax', 'was', 'getting', 'mighty', 'close', 'kinds', 'truths', 'Charge', 'would', 'rather', 'not', 'discuss', 'adults', 'let', 'alone', 'kiddos.But', 'secret', 'genius', 'best', 'kids', 'toons', 'books', 'movies', 'tv', '-they', 'treats', 'kids', 'best', 'selves', 'wise', 'human', 'beings', 'who', 'see', 'things', 'adults', 'ca', ""n't"", 'begin', ""'re"", 'so', 'lost', 'little', 'ego-driven', 'dramas', 'kids', 'are', 'smart', 'enough', 'know', 'how', 'lame', 'society', 'becoming', 'movie', 'just', 'book', 'was', 'many', 'many', 'kids', 'who', 'know', 'something', 'not', 'right', 'how', 'grown-ups', 'live', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'elucidate', 'Enter', 'Lorax.As', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'DeVito', 'Lorax', 'Too', 'predictable', 'too', 'twee', 'how', ""'d"", 'love', 'have', 'heard', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'instead', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'more', 'gravitas', 'less', 'wacky', 'cute', 'voice', 'oh', 'well', 'other', 'hand', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'excellent', 'apart', 'rather', 'excruciating', 'singing', 'why', 'heading', 'towards', 'epic', 'star', 'status', 'own', 'quiet', 'goofy', 'way', 'material', 'perfectly', 'were', 'Selling', 'EVERYTHING', 'what', 'book', 'movie', 'next', 'level', 'Seuss', 'was', 'visionary', 'saw', 'future', 'now', 'live', 'flick', 'there', 'farther', 'deeper', 'realms', 'consumer', 'corporate', 'greed', 'baldly', 'hilariously/painfully', 'daily', 'selfishness', 'society', 'so', 'focused', 'own', 'marketing-driven', 'needs', ""'re"", 'real', 'costs', 'will', 'inevitably', 'bankrupt', 'economically', 'morally', 'are', 'fact', 'making', 'go', 'broke', 'right', 'now.Let', 'face', 'facts', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'country', 'now', 'movie', 'could', 'even', 'get', 'made', 'major', 'studio', ""O'Hare"", 'Air', 'brilliant', 'metaphor', 'economy', 'completely', 'short-sighted', 'greed', 'profit', 'overriding', 'common', 'sense', 'common', 'decency', 'seem', 'daily', 'forget', 'decency', 'towards', 'planet', 'creatures', 'share', 'movie', 'really', 'home', 'endless', 'attendant', 'ironies', 'are', 'very', 'entertaining', 'meta-ugly', 'level', 'garish', 'colors', 'standard', 'characters', 'typically', 'meh', 'tunes', 'lyrics', 'are', 'cut', 'cloth', 'entirely', 'moments', 'make', 'kids', 'film', 'so', 'uniquely', 'subversive', 'Diznee', 'really', 'pay', 'attention', 'doubt', 'characters', 'could', 'look', 'better', 'less', 'cutesy', 'new', 'face-types', 'instead', 'soooo', 'predictable', 'rounded', 'snub-nosed', 'cutie-pie', 'pixar', 'etc', 'stuff', 'now', 'then', 'again', 'archetypal', 'look', 'disguise', 'truly', 'harsh', 'message', 'movie', 'book', 'sending', 'WE', 'ARE', 'KILLING', 'OURSELVES', 'AND', 'OUR', 'HOME', 'MERELY', 'FOR', 'MONEY.Becasue', 'new', 'Lorax', 'undying', 'devotion', 'one', 'simple', 'ugly', 'truth', 'forgive', 'flick', 'cliches', 'flaws', 'desperately', 'need', 'kind', 'truth', 'fast', 'movies', 'art', 'days.The', 'message', 'here', 'WAKE', 'UP', 'WORLD', 'plan', 'ai', ""n't"", 'working.And', 'got', 'film', 'made', 'shipped', 'out', 'shiny', 'new', '3-D', 'thneed', 'containers', 'somehow', 'so', 'perfect', 'so', 'pathetic', 'irony', 'priceless.Or', '19.99', 'good-looking', 'blu-ray', 'plenty', 'entertaining', 'extras', 'ponder', 'whittle', 'fiddle', 'away', 'brief', 'time', 'chop', 'last', 'truffula', 'tree', 'maybe', 'print', 'Lorax', 'know', 'Ted', 'Geisel', 'America', 'best', 'doctor', 'would', 'laugh', 'heartily', 'sadly']",N/A

However, by the end of the movie my opinion was pretty high. I give it only 4 stars because I thought it dragged in spots in the first half.There is extra material added to the book, which is more or less necessary to make this into a full-length movie. I thought the added content kept the spirit of the book and made for a more interesting movie.Where this movie shines is in conveying the messages of the book. Dr. Seuss's book is not subtle. This movie is not subtle either. I was a little shocked at how heavy-handed it was, particularly in the song ""How Bad Could it Be."" I'm sure it will offend people. But by being in your face, this movie is keeping the spirit of the book.I'm glad for this movie. It does gets the message out even more effectively to kids than the book, in my opinion.Are all corporations evil and greedy? Of course not. But whether they are conscious of it or not, their actions often have very adverse effects. People like to ignore this and tell themselves it's not that bad. How bad could it be?One of the easiest ways to make a lot of money is to convert life and health into money. Think about it. Have you ever heard of any companies selling products that were harmful or unhealthy? How about dumping toxic manufacturing byproducts into the land, water and air that we all depend on? How about mistreating employees or demanding too much ""life"" from them? If you have worked very long in corporate America some of these things will likely ring a bell.The answer to the movie's song ""How Bad Could it Be"" is that it could be very bad. We really are making our planet uninhabitable in the long run. We have to change how we do things.I enjoyed the hopeful, upbeat ending to this movie. I hope the reality of our future is as upbeat.

Some people may think it's preachy and others may think there is some ulterior motive being subliminally sent out to children...but what's wrong with a positive message that promotes life and not death.This film was surprisingly entertaining, funny and a bit of action adventure swing to it as well.  Rated PG for the cartoon violence that may be interpreted with the somewhat mature theme of `saving the environment' - specifically trees - the movie tells the tale of town that is entirely plastic in nature...so plastic that they have to sell `air', because the environment is so bad.Giving reverence to everything Dr. Suess - with lots of embellishments, director's Chris Renaud (Despicable Me) and Kyle Balda (director of many animated shorts) the film creatively and colorful explains the world that was created because nature was destroyed. Tree upon tree chopped down for the onset of Plastic and all the bi-products that come from it. Poisons, toxins and bad air - all in one place called Sneedville.It has light-hearted music, witty comedy and even a few wonderful songs you might find yourself humming along with. Headed in the cast is Danny DeVito (Taxi, War of the Roses, batman Returns) himself as The Lorax. The keeper of the trees. He befriends and entrepreneur voiced by Ed Helms (The Office and The Hangover) who is convinced money over nature is far more important. Hence, the destruction of the environment.Zach Efron (High School Musical, 17 again, Charlie St. Cloud) and Taylor Swift (Valentine's day) learn what the truth was and is and with the help of Grandma - ever so cleverly played by Betty White (The Golden Girls, The Proposal) herself, they learn the truth of how important Trees are.Fun, funny and really a family film it might make you think next time you pick up a water bottle....this film has a lot of heart and a lot of funny action.

1468868,AHF97M45JFCB,B005LAIH4A,ONENEO,"[0, 0]","I've got to admit that while 2008's Horton Hears a Who! proved Dr. Seuss' material seemed custom tailored to the computer generated animation movement, the story lacked that degree of relate-ability we generally associate with the classics.  While Horton was done by Ice Age's Blue Sky Studios, the 2012 follow-up Seuss to CG piece (The Lorax) was handed off to Illumination Entertainment, the guys who brought us Despicable Me.  To cut to the chase, The Lorax is very enjoyable animated entertainment.  It's got a few flaws and there are the semi-legitimate balks of conservatism plaguing the piece but we'll get to these issues.Coming in at a runtime of 86-minutes, The Lorax wears a PG rating for animated violence and tension but there's no inappropriate language or adult-themes to worry about here.  Costing $70-million to make, the film actually managed to break even in its domestic opening weekend and has since gone on to take in close to $250-million.  In short, while critics were less than impressed with it, The Lorax is considered a resounding commercial success and continues Illumination's impeccable track record of making hits.The story, like the book it's based on, tells of a young boy who goes seeking the truth about what ever happened to real living trees in a town that is complete and utterly artificial.  However, while the book had but a few pages of Seussian verse to tell its tale of environmentalism, a full length feature film would require far more setup to keep from dragging out and there are some creative licenses taken as a result.  Among these 12-year old Ted (named after Dr. Suess himself; Theodor Geisel), in effort to impress an older red haired high-school girl (Taylor Swift), takes interest in these ""tree things"" and ventures beyond the walls of his fenced-in town to meet up with a mysterious hermit called the Once-Ler.  The Once-Ler (Ed Helms) eventually agrees to tell Ted (Zac Efron) all about his past and what part he played in the obliteration of the forest and resulting exodus of the wildlife that lived in it.  Thus is the movie's greatest strength and arguably its biggest fault when compared to the source material:  There's an undeniably human element present here that harkens back to such other animated films in recent memory as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or say Ratatouille to mention a few.Additionally new to the fold is a villain designed to personify corporatism with some beautifully rendered yet hideous hair and a crew of voiceless lackeys.The titular character appears in the Once-ler's flashback as a ""voice for the trees"" and comes into the film amidst a whole ensemble of characters beautifully transitioned into 3D directly from the pages of the book including those colorful fuzzy-top trees, marshmallow-eating bears and crooning fish.  This part of the film literally breaks down the limitations of the computer color pallet and just how much color the human brain is capable of processing simultaneously.  The Lorax really is a difficult character to flesh out if you think about it and in the end the gruff Danny DeVito does a pretty admirable job of bringing life to the mustachioed orange ball of fur.  While a strong argument could be made that the character is a bit too abrasive to do the book-character justice, I found him appealing in a sort of sensible Yosemite Sam kinda way.A lot of critics fault the film's pro-environmentalist/ anti-consumerism message, which truly is none too discrete here but it's a rather ridiculous complaint considering that is the core theme of the book on which it's based.  When one stops to consider that consumerism is the very fabric of a successful movie (or book), it's a rather annulling lesson but the way I try to reason it, there are far worse messages coming out of Hollywood.

There are musical numbers and numerous messages about consumer marketing, greed, bottled water, and the environment.

Young Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) lives in the prefabricated town of Thneedville, where the landscape is composed of plastic houses and inflatable hedges and trees, and fresh air is sold in water cooler-sized bottles. Things have come about this way because years ago, the reclusive Once-ler (Ed Helms) cut down all the real trees in order to obtain the soft tufts of the truffala trees necessary in the manufacture of his invention, an all-purpose garment.The character of The Lorax (Danny De Vito) is an orange-maned, yellow-mustached, mystical character who acts as a spokesperson and conscience for nature. Directors Chris Renaud and Kyle Balda present this cautionary but insubstantial tale in an explosion of color.  The screenplay, expanded from the book, seems padded even though it clocks in at a modest hour and a half.  A few forgettable songs are tossed in more as filler than to move the story forward.The by-now familiar computer-generated animation gives the characters a rubbery, weightless look.  The artistry here falls far short of the superior Disney Pixar features, which boast stronger scripts.

While Danny DeVito was an inspired voice for the titular Lorax and the screenwriters did a nice job of filling in Ted's town of Thneed-ville I kept wondering that if they had followed Seuss' original narrative more closely and maybe introduced Thneed-ville and its denizens later in the film and reduced the amount of the Lorax's screen time while upping his grumpiness?  Perhaps the movie might have been more fun and lively?  Because as it stands it's a little busy.  I felt the extra added narrative, especially the amount of time spent in Thneed-ville right up front, detracted from the overall story of the mess that the Once-ler made of the environment.IMO it might have made more sense to do the story straight as as an act I for the movie and let act II play out as Ted's story.  The impact of the destruction of the environment by the Once-ler's industriously fueled greed, so central to this story, got muddied by the padding and it didn't have to if it was constructed differently.  It became more of Ted's story to be an independent person/ thinker and of his getting the girl.  These deviations were okay I suppose but I felt that they took away from the story's original emphasis.

The problem has always been in finding a style that can adequately capture the author's unique style. Live-action movies like How the Grinch Stole Christmas were hamstrung by leaving the animated format, and The Cat in the Hat suffered a similar fate made worse by Mike Meyers' inability to be funny. A CGI version of Horton Hears a Who! better interpreted Seuss' daffy visual style, and that model is employed yet again with equal vibrancy in The Lorax, a film that shows the author's cautionary tale is as vital today as ever.Dr. Seuss(real name Theodor Geisel), who never went into one of his many classic children's books with a moral in mind, nevertheless expressed many of his views on the world through his stories, with The Lorax perhaps being the most overt. Essentially a cautionary tale about the dangers of over industrialization on the natural environment, the rather simple story has been given some extra padding by the folks at Illumination, bringing some of the same zany humor from their hit, Despicable Me(including a couple of nods to the film). Taking corporate greed and ecological neglect to an apocalyptic nth degree, the story takes place in Thneedville, a city completely made up of plastic and not an ounce of nature in sight. A chirpy little song in the beginning tells us that the people of Thneedville like it this way, with their plastic trees and bottled air(a clear shot at those who pay for packaged water). 12-year old Ted(Zac Efron) exists in this bright but bland composite town, zipping past his blissfully unaware neighbors on his motor scooter. He's infatuated with his neighbor, Audrey(Taylor Swift), and when she expresses the desire to see an actual living tree, Ted makes it his life's mission to make sure it happens. Heck, he might even get a kiss out of the deal. With the help of his mischievous grandma(Betty White), Ted learns of a mysterious recluse outside of town known as the Once-Ler(Ed Helms), who may know where the last trees can be found.Braving the smog filled world outside of Thneedville, and drawing the suspicion of the town's benefactor(Rob Riggle), Ted discovers the Once-Ler is a man burdened by years of guilt. The architect of Thneedville's creation and destroyer of the once plentiful Trifula trees, the Once-Ler was once just a man with a dream to strike it rich. Discovering that his silken invention could only thrive by chopping down all the trees, he runs afoul of the Lorax(Danny Devito), a little orange blob of a creature who serves as the spiritual protector of the forests. If Ted wants the last Trifula seed, he'll have to listen to the Once-Ler's story of how he let corporate greed blind him to the destruction being done to the world around him.The Lorax has come under scrutiny lately from some who feel it's ""indoctrinating"" children to despise big business by painting them all as evil. Those dirty industrialists! The story is actually a redemptive one for all involved, not just the Once-Ler but for Ted also. Ted's mission starts off as completely selfish, he could care less about the environment or making the world a better place. He just wants to impress the hot girl in town. Through the Once-Ler's story, he learns to appreciate nature in all it's forms and the benefits it provides that plastic and steel simply can't replicate.  Those complaining about The Lorax's lessons either don't know the book has been around for some forty years, or have never seen the film. Probably both. Those same people, who always seem to make more noise equivalent to how wrong they are, fail to realize that The Lorax isn't all that different from most children's stories. Then again, these are also the same folks who think suggesting healthier meals for kids is akin to turning the country into a police state. It's all just nonsensical political pandering. The Lorax, who is friends with the Once-Ler early on, doesn't have a problem with industry. He gets angry when it destroys everything else just for some short term profit. Surely, somebody like Lou Dobbs can see the difference, right? Eh, probably not. He's not paid to understand nuance.Directed by Chris Renaud, The Lorax is bold and dynamic visually, although the 3D adds little real value. Calling this simply a film for kids seems inadequate, because the message truly is universal and one that all people need to hear. It's about taking personal responsibility for the welfare of this planet. How something like that can be considered a hot button issue nowadays is absurd, but The Lorax gets its point across in the most fun way possible, just like Dr. Seuss would have wanted.",4,The works

Or are the majority of professional reviewers correct in their belief that the subject matter is not expansive enough for a full-length feature?Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) is a twelve year-old boy in the perfectly plastic metropolis of Thneedville. Everything in Thneedville is artificial and air itself is only available to those who pay for it. Ted (Efron), more than anything, wants to impress Audrey. Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) wants to see a real tree, but all the ones in Thneedville are electric and powered by batteries. Some even come equipped with a disco function utilizing music and mirrored balls. Ted asks his family where he might find a tree and his grandmother (voiced by Betty White) says that if he wants to know about trees he'll have to venture outside of town and ask the Once-ler. The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms) is a hermit who never leaves his house and refuses to even speak to visitors until his very specific, very peculiar demands are met. Once they are, he begins to recount the epic tale of his arrival in the forest and eventual introduction to its protector and advocate The Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito).In such politically-charged times, there'll no doubt be critics who decry this film as preachy or anti-business. Perhaps if I held beliefs similar to said critics, I might agree. As I don't hold such beliefs, what I saw was highly entertaining and even hilarious. I'm no fan of Zac Efron or Taylor Swift, but they were up to the task and while Danny DeVito might not have been the best choice, in my opinion, he managed.

Bottom line, it wasn't funny and the story was very dry. The animation was beautiful and the voice acting was pretty good, but nothing else materialized that was of any value. The first half hour is promising and foretells an intriguing story, but nothing really happens. The humor was obviously meant for five year-olds, as it was 90% slap-stick ""guy runs into pole/gets hit with a fish."" I went into the movie knowing that it would be preachy, but this was overkill. This movie just was not good. A child may enjoy it, seeing as story isn't one of their focal points, but I can't foresee this as a movie any adult would watch a second time. It wasn't an awful movie as the film itself is absolutely breath-taking, but the story is a huge let down. The three bonus mini-movies were all under five-minutes, which isn't really an issue.

The computer animated film adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book is exactly what you expect from a Hollywood studio, for better or worse. It is a story of adventure and romance set in a colorful world of animation. Characters are likable (except one). There are pleasant and lively (but forgettable) musical numbers. And of course, the Lorax, an orange-colored creature with a long, bushy moustache.This is a fun, family-oriented film with a message, which is conveyed in a very straightforward way. This was a bit surprising to me as ""The Lorax"" is made by Illumination Entertainment, a company best known for ""Despicable Me."" Those who remember Gru and his army of minions may miss the dark humor that would have been perfect for the Dr. Seuss adaptation.While nuance and ambiguity are integral part of language, visuals play a major role in film. It is understandable that in translating the original book's text to screen, something must go. What arrives instead is a good-natured and idealistic hero Ted Wiggins, his love interest Audrey, and a ""villain"" Aloysius O'Hare, mayor of Thneedville, who has made an enormous fortune by selling fresh air to the residents. Their action-filled story almost overshadows that of Once-ler and The Lorax.As entertainment ""The Lorax"" is pretty good, but sometimes it looks as if, instead of complementing each other, two stories are competing for attention within one film.",3,The Lorax in Hollywood,1350604800,"10 19, 2012",2012,1479,"['original', 'story', 'so', 'famous', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'recap', 'computer', 'animated', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'book', 'exactly', 'what', 'expect', 'Hollywood', 'studio', 'better', 'worse', 'story', 'adventure', 'romance', 'set', 'colorful', 'world', 'animation', 'Characters', 'are', 'likable', 'one', 'are', 'pleasant', 'lively', 'forgettable', 'musical', 'numbers', 'course', 'Lorax', 'orange-colored', 'creature', 'long', 'bushy', 'moustache.This', 'fun', 'family-oriented', 'film', 'message', 'conveyed', 'very', 'straightforward', 'way', 'was', 'bit', 'surprising', 'Lorax', 'made', 'Illumination', 'Entertainment', 'company', 'best', 'known', 'Despicable', 'Me', 'who', 'remember', 'Gru', 'army', 'minions', 'may', 'miss', 'dark', 'humor', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'adaptation.While', 'nuance', 'ambiguity', 'are', 'integral', 'part', 'language', 'visuals', 'play', 'major', 'role', 'film', 'understandable', 'translating', 'original', 'book', 'text', 'screen', 'something', 'must', 'go', 'What', 'instead', 'good-natured', 'idealistic', 'hero', 'Ted', 'Wiggins', 'love', 'interest', 'Audrey', 'villain', 'Aloysius', ""O'Hare"", 'mayor', 'Thneedville', 'who', 'made', 'enormous', 'fortune', 'selling', 'fresh', 'air', 'residents', 'action-filled', 'story', 'almost', 'Once-ler', 'Lorax.As', 'entertainment', 'Lorax', 'pretty', 'good', 'instead', 'complementing', 'other', 'two', 'stories', 'are', 'competing', 'attention', 'one', 'film']",N/A

In THE LORAX, Ted (Zac Efron) is a twelve-year-old boy who lives in the plasticized, walled city of Thneedville. Ted is in love with a teenage girl named Audrey (Taylor Swift). Audrey doesn't quite fit in Thneedville and paints the back of her house full of colorful trees which no longer exist. She longs to see a real tree and Ted becomes determined to find one for her. During dinner one night, Ted's Grammy Norma (Betty White) tells Ted that in order to find out what happened to the trees and if there's another one to be found, he needs to speak with the Once-ler (Ed Helms) who lives outside the city walls. Ted has never been outside the city, but sets out on a mission to meet the Once-ler and find a tree. He succeeds in finding the creature on the edge of town and the Once-ler tells Ted his story of how he started life off as an industrious, young man with a heart who just wanted to be a success, how he found a valley of paradise, and how he met The Lorax (Danny Devito). Before the story is through, the Once-ler's tale will merge with Ted's and perhaps revive the valley again.Visually, THE LORAX is stunning. Both the natural beauty of the paradise valley and the plastic artificiality of Thneedville are full of bright and beautiful colors. These are contrasted by the present day greys of the world outside of Thneedville, the world that the Once-ler created.The story stays fairly close to Dr. Seuss' original tale. However, there are a few differences. The Once-ler isn't a creature that's only seen by his hands, but instead has been transformed into a thin and tall man. When we first see the young Once-ler, there are distinct feelings of sympathy for him and empathy with his plight. It's hard to believe this industrious man will be responsible for cutting down all the Truffula Trees, but the temptations of family and fortune are strong. There are a couple of scenes in the forest that are added to pad the story. Also, instead of leaving at different times, the animals of the forest leave together in a mass exodus. Personally, I thought this element weakened the story.Like the book, there is a strong conservationist message to THE LORAX, but I didn't see any anti-capitalistic undertones. The Once-ler is ""punished"" not because he was industrious and wanted to earn a living, but because he gave in to greed and destroyed the very thing that was allowing him to earn a living. Mr. O'Hare, the Mayor of Thneedville isn't a villain because he's a businessman, but because he's manufactured his fortune based upon a lie and even when confronted with the truth, he refuses to concede.There's a lot of music in THE LORAX that comes in a variety of styles, folk, rock-a-billy, and some Broadway-type showtunes. Personally, I liked the smaller numbers which are mostly sung by the Once-ler (Ed Helms).THE LORAX has broad appeal. It's a film that kids will enjoy for the characters and bright scenery, while many adults will enjoy for some of the subtle bits of humor. The mass consumerism message isn't as blatant as in WALL-E, but it's still there. Overall, it's a movie that The Lorax himself would probably enjoy watching.",4,"""Everybody Needs a Thneed!""",1330732800,"03 3, 2012",2012,3403,"['Based', 'book', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'name', 'officially', 'part', 'title', 'THE', 'LORAX', 'been', 'contemporized', 'bit', 'making', 'accessible', 'not', 'only', 'super-environmental-types', 'who', 'were', 'raised', 'conservation', 'not', 'environmentalism', 'THE', 'LORAX', 'Ted', 'Zac', 'Efron', 'twelve-year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'plasticized', 'walled', 'city', 'Thneedville', 'Ted', 'love', 'teenage', 'girl', 'named', 'Audrey', 'Taylor', 'Swift', 'Audrey', ""n't"", 'quite', 'fit', 'Thneedville', 'back', 'house', 'full', 'colorful', 'trees', 'no', 'longer', 'exist', 'see', 'real', 'tree', 'Ted', 'becomes', 'determined', 'find', 'one', 'dinner', 'one', 'night', 'Ted', 'Grammy', 'Norma', 'Betty', 'White', 'tells', 'Ted', 'order', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'trees', 'one', 'be', 'found', 'speak', 'Once-ler', 'Ed', 'Helms', 'who', 'city', 'walls', 'Ted', 'never', 'been', 'city', 'out', 'mission', 'meet', 'Once-ler', 'find', 'tree', 'finding', 'creature', 'edge', 'town', 'Once-ler', 'tells', 'Ted', 'story', 'how', 'started', 'life', 'off', 'industrious', 'young', 'man', 'heart', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'be', 'success', 'how', 'found', 'valley', 'paradise', 'how', 'met', 'Lorax', 'Danny', 'Devito', 'story', 'Once-ler', 'tale', 'will', 'merge', 'Ted', 'perhaps', 'revive', 'valley', 'again.Visually', 'LORAX', 'stunning', 'natural', 'beauty', 'paradise', 'valley', 'plastic', 'artificiality', 'Thneedville', 'are', 'full', 'bright', 'beautiful', 'colors', 'are', 'contrasted', 'present', 'day', 'greys', 'world', 'Thneedville', 'world', 'Once-ler', 'created.The', 'story', 'fairly', 'close', 'Dr.', 'Seuss', 'original', 'tale', 'However', 'are', 'few', 'differences', 'Once-ler', ""n't"", 'creature', 'only', 'seen', 'hands', 'instead', 'been', 'transformed', 'thin', 'tall', 'man', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'young', 'Once-ler', 'are', 'distinct', 'feelings', 'sympathy', 'empathy', 'plight', 'hard', 'believe', 'industrious', 'man', 'will', 'be', 'responsible', 'cutting', 'down', 'Truffula', 'Trees', 'temptations', 'family', 'fortune', 'are', 'strong', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'forest', 'are', 'added', 'pad', 'story', 'Also', 'instead', 'leaving', 'different', 'times', 'animals', 'forest', 'leave', 'together', 'mass', 'exodus', 'Personally', 'thought', 'element', 'weakened', 'story.Like', 'book', 'strong', 'conservationist', 'message', 'THE', 'LORAX', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'anti-capitalistic', 'undertones', 'Once-ler', 'punished', 'not', 'was', 'industrious', 'wanted', 'earn', 'living', 'gave', 'greed', 'destroyed', 'very', 'thing', 'was', 'allowing', 'earn', 'living', 'Mr.', ""O'Hare"", 'Mayor', 'Thneedville', ""n't"", 'villain', 'businessman', 'manufactured', 'fortune', 'based', 'lie', 'even', 'when', 'confronted', 'truth', 'concede.There', 'lot', 'music', 'THE', 'LORAX', 'variety', 'styles', 'folk', 'rock-a-billy', 'Broadway-type', 'showtunes', 'Personally', 'liked', 'smaller', 'numbers', 'are', 'mostly', 'sung', 'Once-ler', 'Ed', 'Helms', '.THE', 'LORAX', 'broad', 'appeal', 'film', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'characters', 'bright', 'scenery', 'many', 'adults', 'will', 'enjoy', 'subtle', 'bits', 'humor', 'mass', 'consumerism', 'message', ""n't"", 'as', 'blatant', 'WALL-E', 'still', 'there', 'Overall', 'movie', 'Lorax', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'watching']",N/A

This movie features a futuristic town built entirely out of technology and artificial nature. Trees were long gone by the time this modern town was built. A little girl in the town tells a boy that she would like an actual tree for her birthday. Longing to impress her, the little boy travels far out of town to find an authentic tree. He travels to a land of horrible pollution and meets a man who tells him a story of trees and plants. The boy must bring trees back into the town with the help of the Lorax, a creature who speaks for the trees and was around in the time of the trees. An evil businessman, however, does everything he can to keep nature away from the town. This is a must-watch for all age groups!
