1045309,A1NPROXGAEEPHD,B000MEYJJW,"Amazon Customer ""Mrs. Snowman""","[11, 11]","I was so excited to see this classic on DVD. I totally remember these episodes from my kindergarten days. Oddly enough I got The World of Strawberry Shortcake on audio cassette tape for Easter when it first came out, and my friend had the one in Big Apple City on audio cassette. It is funny they released the audios of the movies...kind of hard to follow if you can't see what is going on. In 3rd grade I was still hog-wild about SSC and I was elated when my school (which was a private school) showed the movie version of The World of SSC. It was neat to see what was going on due to sound effects and see that the Pieman not only had a funny chant but a funny dance and that that funny whizzing noise I heard on the cassette was a lady bug, and that crash bang boom was Shortcake's army of marching trees tearing down the Pieman's Pietin Palace, which was made of pots and pans, for example--it made so much more sense to see what was going on. It is funny that they released it on audio in the first place but I must say I played my cassette almost to death and drove my family almost nuts playing it over and over in the car on our long trips! Ah, the memories. What I don't think I will EVER understand is WHY, oh WHY, didn't Strawberry ever get her own syndicated TV show?!? She certainly was popular enough. She was just used as a TV special or to fill-in for extra time, etc. The Care Bears got their's, so did Glo Friends, My Little Ponies, Rainbow Brite...even Lady Lovelilocks and the Pixie Tails, and they NEVER caught on like the other characters!I originally would give this 5 stars but I have to give it 1, sorry to say, due to the fact that they did a hatchet job on the DVD version. I have listened to the World of SSC soundtrack enough times to realize they have cut out a lot of the dialogue as well as a very cute song (""Sunflower Market""). HOW COULD THEY DO THIS??? They should have left her totally alone and included 2 discs if they couldn't fit both movies on one disc, they should put each unadulterated movie onto one disc into one package--they could have done that!! I am berry berry upset!!",1,Berry sad about the changes.

1045311,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B000MEYJJW,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[12, 19]","Currently seen on TV and in a series of DVD releases, Strawberry and her friends actually got their start in a series of specials in the 80s. Now, with this DVD, two of these are available for everyone to view --- ""The World of Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City."" In the first, Strawberry and her friends face the Peculiar Purple Pie Man, who is out to steal the berries from Strawberry Land with the help of his berry birds. In the second, Pie Man is at it again. He and Strawberry are finalists in a baking contest, and he's determined to win, no matter what sorts of dirty tactics he has to resort to.This show feels very 80s, definitely, but suits its time. The characters are reasonably cute, the plot holds up well enough and there are some fairly decent songs included.This DVD contains decent story content, but is generally a straight, no-frills port. There are no close-captions, subtitles and no special features other than previews for other releases from the company that put this out (Allumination) and a bonus cartoon that may or may not interest you or your kids --- ""Snow White and the Magic Mirror.""If you have fond memories of this old 80s cartoon, then this is definitely worth a look. It's also probably worth a lot for those that are fans of the current version of the program and want to see the origins of the series. Just don't expect anything great when it comes to production values.",4,The Origins of Strawberry and Friends,1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,1442,"['Currently', 'seen', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'releases', 'Strawberry', 'friends', 'actually', 'got', 'start', 'series', 'specials', '80s', 'Now', 'DVD', 'two', 'are', 'available', 'everyone', 'view', 'World', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'Strawberry', 'Shortcake', 'Big', 'Apple', 'City', 'first', 'Strawberry', 'friends', 'face', 'Peculiar', 'Purple', 'Pie', 'Man', 'who', 'out', 'steal', 'berries', 'Strawberry', 'Land', 'help', 'berry', 'birds', 'second', 'Pie', 'Man', 'again', 'Strawberry', 'are', 'finalists', 'baking', 'contest', 'determined', 'win', 'matter', 'what', 'dirty', 'tactics', 'resort', 'to.This', 'show', 'very', '80s', 'definitely', 'suits', 'time', 'characters', 'are', 'reasonably', 'cute', 'plot', 'up', 'well', 'enough', 'are', 'fairly', 'decent', 'songs', 'included.This', 'DVD', 'contains', 'decent', 'story', 'content', 'generally', 'straight', 'no-frills', 'port', 'are', 'close-captions', 'subtitles', 'special', 'other', 'previews', 'other', 'releases', 'company', 'put', 'out', 'Allumination', 'bonus', 'cartoon', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'interest', 'kids', 'Snow', 'White', 'Magic', 'Mirror', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'old', '80s', 'cartoon', 'then', 'definitely', 'worth', 'look', 'also', 'probably', 'lot', 'are', 'fans', 'current', 'version', 'program', 'want', 'see', 'origins', 'series', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'great', 'when', 'production', 'values']",Strawberry Shortcake: The World of Strawberry Shortcake & Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City

1045317,A31TVT9DSU5HL1,B000MEYJJW,Paul Jutras,"[1, 1]","I've always been a fan of Strawberry shortcake from 1980s classic to they modern 2010 one on The Hub. The biggest let down with this DVD is no Miss Sour Grapes who I guess was added to the on going TV series but not made by these two special done by the creators of the classic holiday specials like Rudolph and Frosty. I also found myself a little bit at a lost when seeing this classic after so long as the characters appearances and personalities have changed so much between 1980s, 2004 and 2010 versions. In fact I'm pretty sure this version has much more characters than either of the two more modern versions created.  This classic has The Purple Pie man at his berry best form. Lemon I was most taken with when it comes to character differences as being introduced in Big Apple City she's a would be actress rather than the brat she was in 2004 or the salon keeper in 2010.  It does also seem to be that the modern series on The Hub has made some attempt to honor this classic series with their Itsy Bitsy Adventures as Snail Mail and Butterfly planes in the 1980s classics are replaced by other bug friends in 2010 as well as the characters size and world they live in. The first story on this DVD deals with Strawberry thinking her friends don't like her any more when really their planning a surprise birthday. Only the Purple Pie Man's gift isn't the type you would want to give anyone. Then Strawberry compete against the Purple Pie Man in Big Apple City baking contest and make a whole lot of new friends as the Pie Man try to keep her away from the station.",4,similiar but different,1300924800,"03 24, 2011",2011,1572,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'fan', 'Strawberry', 'shortcake', '1980s', 'classic', 'modern', '2010', 'one', 'Hub', 'biggest', 'let', 'down', 'DVD', 'Miss', 'Sour', 'Grapes', 'who', 'guess', 'was', 'added', 'going', 'TV', 'series', 'not', 'made', 'two', 'special', 'done', 'creators', 'classic', 'holiday', 'specials', 'Rudolph', 'Frosty', 'also', 'found', 'little', 'bit', 'lost', 'when', 'seeing', 'classic', 'so', 'long', 'characters', 'appearances', 'personalities', 'have', 'changed', 'so', 'much', '1980s', '2004', '2010', 'versions', 'fact', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'version', 'much', 'more', 'characters', 'two', 'more', 'modern', 'versions', 'created', 'classic', 'Purple', 'Pie', 'man', 'berry', 'best', 'form', 'Lemon', 'was', 'most', 'taken', 'when', 'character', 'differences', 'being', 'introduced', 'Big', 'Apple', 'City', 'would', 'be', 'actress', 'rather', 'brat', 'was', '2004', 'salon', 'keeper', '2010', 'also', 'seem', 'be', 'modern', 'series', 'Hub', 'made', 'attempt', 'honor', 'classic', 'series', 'Itsy', 'Bitsy', 'Adventures', 'Snail', 'Mail', 'Butterfly', 'planes', '1980s', 'classics', 'are', 'replaced', 'other', 'bug', 'friends', '2010', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'size', 'world', 'live', 'first', 'story', 'DVD', 'deals', 'Strawberry', 'thinking', 'friends', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'more', 'when', 'really', 'planning', 'surprise', 'birthday', 'Only', 'Purple', 'Pie', 'Man', 'gift', ""n't"", 'type', 'would', 'want', 'give', 'anyone', 'Then', 'Strawberry', 'compete', 'Purple', 'Pie', 'Man', 'Big', 'Apple', 'City', 'baking', 'contest', 'make', 'whole', 'lot', 'new', 'friends', 'Pie', 'Man', 'try', 'keep', 'away', 'station']",Strawberry Shortcake: The World of Strawberry Shortcake & Strawberry Shortcake in Big Apple City
1045318,A2SR8CWDTIKXAT,B000MEYJJW,Tell It Like It Is,"[28, 30]","I loved the 80's Strawberry Shortcake. I love their costumes so much more than the ones today, and I think Russi Taylor IS Strawberry Shortcake! What a cute voice.When my daughter was born, I collected many vintage dolls and toys for her from that Kenner collection of the 80's (including dolls from Brazil; my favorite being Little Coffee) and she strongly prefers the vintage stuff to the new stuff. Her number one favorite is Plum Puddin' (as a girl). The new stuff is okay, but like My Little Pony, its very different in its modern incarnation. The original cartoons had two adversaries; the Peculair Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak and Sour Grapes. The new stuff didn't feature these fabulous villians at first, but added them later in a sort of role reversal with Sour Grapes being timid and softer and PPPM being hard and evil. I still like the old versions of them better.Personally, we are waiting for the Berrykins episode and the House Warming episodes of the the 80's series to be released on DVD. I wish they'd just package them as one collection. At any rate, I had a bad bootleg copy on VHS tape and it was so poor, some of it was just ""snow"" on the screen. I'm so glad they finally are putting these out. If you love SSC or have a young child, these episodes are worth adding to the collection.
