Women were finally allowed to be full participants in professional activities, minorities were guaranteed access to the housing of their choice and pornography became widely available. Unlike the other changes, the toppling of the laws against pornography was largely the result of one event, the film, ""Deep Throat."" For some time in the 1970's the legal issues regarding this film appeared almost every night on the local news. I can still remember the anchor, a man named Larry Hightchew, recanting the latest events in the ongoing legal battles over the showing of ""Deep Throat.""""Midnight Blue"" was a late-night TV cable show in the New York area starring porn pusher Al Goldstein, and it was designed to push the last limits of censorship. By modern standards, there is little in this DVD that could be considered close to pornographic, a great deal is based on Goldstein and the other producers ranting against the often absurd contradictions inherent in the censorship laws. Most significantly is the conviction of male ""Deep Throat"" star Harry Reems on obscenity charges and how much effort the federal government put into a case that was ultimately dropped. There is an extensive interview with Reems where he recounts the trial, the making of ""Deep Throat"" and his life after the movie.This movie could serve as a reference work in sociology courses studying the changes in American society that took place in the 1970's. Goldstein went as far as he could and there are some scenes included that he was unable to place on the air. A great deal of effort was expended by the federal and local governments to block the availability of pornography, all to no avail when the U. S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the porn industry on first amendment grounds.  If you view this movie within the mental context of the dramatic changes that were taking place in the United States at the time, then you will find it educational. Outside that realm, it is little more than titillating entertainment that is milder than what is now widely available, some of which is a consequence of ""Midnight Blue.""",4,Historically interesting as the legal barriers against pornography were falling,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,2319,"['seventies', 'was', 'time', 'great', 'turmoil', 'social', 'structure', 'United', 'States', 'many', 'previously', 'understood', 'codified', 'social', 'restrictions', 'were', 'eliminated', 'nearly', 'cases', 'end', 'results', 'were', 'positive', 'Women', 'were', 'finally', 'allowed', 'be', 'full', 'participants', 'professional', 'activities', 'minorities', 'were', 'guaranteed', 'access', 'housing', 'choice', 'pornography', 'became', 'widely', 'available', 'other', 'changes', 'toppling', 'laws', 'pornography', 'was', 'largely', 'result', 'one', 'event', 'film', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'time', '1970', 'legal', 'issues', 'regarding', 'film', 'appeared', 'almost', 'night', 'local', 'news', 'can', 'still', 'remember', 'anchor', 'man', 'named', 'Larry', 'Hightchew', 'recanting', 'latest', 'events', 'ongoing', 'legal', 'battles', 'showing', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'Midnight', 'Blue', 'was', 'late-night', 'TV', 'cable', 'show', 'New', 'York', 'area', 'starring', 'porn', 'pusher', 'Al', 'Goldstein', 'was', 'designed', 'push', 'last', 'limits', 'censorship', 'modern', 'standards', 'little', 'DVD', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'close', 'pornographic', 'great', 'deal', 'based', 'Goldstein', 'other', 'producers', 'ranting', 'often', 'absurd', 'contradictions', 'inherent', 'censorship', 'laws', 'Most', 'significantly', 'conviction', 'male', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'star', 'Harry', 'Reems', 'obscenity', 'charges', 'how', 'much', 'effort', 'federal', 'government', 'put', 'case', 'was', 'ultimately', 'dropped', 'extensive', 'interview', 'Reems', 'where', 'trial', 'making', 'Deep', 'Throat', 'life', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'could', 'serve', 'reference', 'work', 'sociology', 'courses', 'studying', 'changes', 'American', 'society', 'took', 'place', '1970', 'Goldstein', 'went', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'are', 'scenes', 'included', 'was', 'unable', 'place', 'air', 'great', 'deal', 'effort', 'was', 'expended', 'federal', 'local', 'governments', 'block', 'availability', 'pornography', 'avail', 'when', 'U.', 'S.', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ruled', 'favor', 'porn', 'industry', 'first', 'amendment', 'grounds', 'view', 'movie', 'mental', 'context', 'dramatic', 'changes', 'were', 'taking', 'place', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'then', 'will', 'find', 'educational', 'realm', 'little', 'more', 'titillating', 'entertainment', 'milder', 'what', 'now', 'widely', 'available', 'consequence', 'Midnight', 'Blue']",N/A

Al Goldstein (publisher of Screw) is a great host since he wants to elevate these films to legit status, but he's a dirty old man hitting on his female guests. Imagine Charlie Rose with a raging libido. Even 30 years later, there's nothing quaint about this show. It would still widen eyeballs on any cable channel - even in this era of Howard Stern and HBO's ""Real Sex.""This 2-hour compendium of episodes on this DVD features Al's interviews with ""Deep Throat"" related figures - director Gerard Damiano, star Harry Reems, supporting actress Carol Connors and Chuck Traynor, the ex-husband of Linda Lovelace. I have seen ""Inside Deep Throat,"" but  this is more entertaining and informative.While Al doesn't have a commentary track, he gives us a modern perspective with informative subtitles. There are a few shockers among Al's tidbits. What would be one? That Carol Connors, who played the nurse in ""Deep Throat,"" is Thora Birch's mom. I didn't know that. (Thora's dad was erotic actor John Birch.) That fact alone was worth the rental. The producer wanted Carol to be the star of ""Deep Throat,"" but she couldn't perform the star stunt so she took the supporting role. Although in her interview, she mentions having added that technique to her repertoire. This is something completely skipped over in ""Inside Deep Throat.""Reems' interview is amazing for his future vision of what will happen to the porn film industry with the introduction of home video. He is a naked Nostradamus. He speaks of his court case when he was on trial for his involvement with ""Deep Throat."" Traynor's a weird character since as Lovelace's husband he's been accused of being beating her. Traynor's defense is that they had a BDSM relationship. Either way, the man is creepy. Damiano comes off as a filmmaker instead of merely a slimy mobster tool. Although for a formerhairdresser, he has a hideous wig.People complain about commercials, but on this DVD set, you will be glued to the screen during the breaks. They didn't advertise hamburgers on ""Midnight Blue."" It's hilarious how they have to hint what goes on at ""leisure spas."" Are we really supposed to believe the naked women are merely giving therapeutic massages and baths? There's a porn theater letting you know what you can get for $2.49 - ""Your best hardcore film bargain!"" There's even an ad for ""Synth Coke"" that can be had by sending your money to a PO Box in Kittery, Maine. Plus you get to see the pool at Plato's Retreat. This is a well-rounded view of Manhattan's carnal underbelly.The video quality is better than what you'd expect from a mid-70s to 80s cable access show. There are periodic glitches, but nothing that ruins the experience.
