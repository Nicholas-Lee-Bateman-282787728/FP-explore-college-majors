1351823,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B003L77GFG,Alan Ramirez,"[3, 4]","This show is one of my favorites since it came out. It has the perfect formula to be a good one, but it's getting old the same thing all the time.Season four shows us a more mature cast, like Serena stopping dating random guys, Blair finally leaving Chuck (for good), and Dan finally finding his own way without Serena, Vanessa being a little more independent, and Jenny just messing up with Blair (but she only appeared like in 4 episodes in the whole season). But what about Nate? He didn't had strong plots... he was just there filling some minutes of the 42 minute episodes. I hope that season five gives Chace the opportunity to show a good work as Nate, as he was in season one.Anyway, the show keeps being good but I hope it shows something new at the beginning of the new season, because it has the qualities to be a show to remember.",4,Gossip Girl plays safe,1313798400,"08 20, 2011",2011,842,"['show', 'one', 'favorites', 'came', 'out', 'perfect', 'formula', 'be', 'good', 'one', 'getting', 'old', 'same', 'thing', 'time.Season', 'four', 'more', 'mature', 'cast', 'Serena', 'stopping', 'dating', 'random', 'guys', 'Blair', 'finally', 'leaving', 'Chuck', 'good', 'Dan', 'finally', 'finding', 'own', 'way', 'Serena', 'Vanessa', 'being', 'little', 'more', 'independent', 'Jenny', 'just', 'messing', 'up', 'Blair', 'only', 'appeared', '4', 'episodes', 'whole', 'season', 'what', 'Nate', 'did', ""n't"", 'had', 'strong', 'plots', 'was', 'just', 'filling', 'minutes', '42', 'minute', 'episodes', 'hope', 'season', 'five', 'Chace', 'opportunity', 'show', 'good', 'work', 'Nate', 'was', 'season', 'one.Anyway', 'show', 'being', 'good', 'hope', 'something', 'new', 'beginning', 'new', 'season', 'qualities', 'be', 'show', 'remember']",N/A

Blair focus on her goals and lands a job intership at a fashion magazine.Chuck has a brief romance with another chick but ends ( forgot her name).Jenny is finally GONE after this season which makes me happy she was on like 2 episodes only i think =). Serena of course has more than one lover in this season that's nothing new( i love how she falls for various men every single season) but never really deciding between Nate and Dan.Serena and Blair are going to Columbia and living together which is nice their friendship is just getting stronger.Dan feels something for blair, then Serena again -_- idk i dont really like dan lately also nate both characters need to improve all they live for is Serena or random girls they need a life!Well well the best of this season is Paris, Chucks empire in jeopardy,Blair n chuck being friends with benefits, Blair working ( it was entertaining),the prince and Blair! and the last episode omg!!!!!who is pregnant?
