It's a brilliant show-and although it's content is a bit dated, it's still a great program.  It's one I grew up with as a kid and loved dearly.The content of Season 4 contains some of my favorite episodes-the key one being ""Parade"" the continuation of John & Roy rebuilding their 1930's fire engine.  Having already watched through seasons 1 through 3, 1 & 2, the quality was quite decent for an early 70's TV series.  Admittedly, the sound quality did vary from episode to episode-the overall picture quality was very good.Season 3 began to slip - seeing some weak syndicated prints added into the mix. There weren't many, but there should have been none.Getting to Season 4. It appears to be entirely poor quality syndicated prints.  The films have scratches, splices, skips, the picture jitters and the colors are pale.  Audio also suffers: some episodes are very muted-so much so it's difficult to hear the underscore music. Others you can actually hear the click of the sprockets in the projector(it's faint, but it's there).  It's like watching these on a grade school film projector!Shame on Universal for offering up this great show in such poor quality-and with no bonus material(Like the animated Cartoon series-Emergency+4.

The TV show that broke new ground for all action series to come is more enthralling than ever on DVD!You have to consider EMERGENCY a great show if it can convincingly combine both medical drama and nail-biting action rescues. The writers, creators, special effects artists and stuntmen on this show went to great ends to think up convincing accidents and then depict them for entertainment purposes. Throw in 2 likeable guys in the form of Kevin Tighe and Randy Mantooth along with a station of cut-ups and you have a hit series on your hands.A lot of tongue in cheek humor made this series for me as Gage was always trying to get rich quick or fireman Chet Kelly letting loose with the practical jokes, but yet it was all played straight to save others as we the viewers learned at least superficially the ins and outs of the paramedic business.

The stories were exciting and action packed, and the writers and actors had the characters nailed.  Sure, Gage & DeSoto's fellow firefighters were fairly one dimensional characters - but they were FUN one dimensional characters, and the focus of the show was really Gage, DeSoto, Dr. Brackett, Dr. Early, Nurse McCall, and Dr. Morton anyway.The realism presented on the show by this point had become expected, and the technical jargon was actually fairly well known and understood by the fans.  Emergency was a driving force behind the education of America on the procedures and perils of being a firefighter or paramedic, and it gave a glimpse into what doctors and nurses really did in a hospital.The fact that Emergency was as successful as it was paved the way for later TV shows like E.R. and movies like Backdraft.The previous DVD set (Season 3) was a hit or miss affair.  Good episodes, some looking good on the DVD, some just OK, but several episodes had the wrong theme song and opening credits. It was the same opening credit sequence used for the TV Land showings, which had always been a bone of contention with some fans (the original theme song was one of the best in TV history, and to have it replaced was foolish).  Hopefully for this set Universal gets it right.

Season 4 leaves a bad taste in my mouth.I was anticipating ""more of the same"" from the previous releases.Season 3 upset me some in that included syndication prints.My heart sank on the opening menu of season 4, with the poor quality audible of the ""Emergency!"" theme.Not only are these syndication prints, there's no original master print to the entire ""E!S-4"" collection. What a shame for a great season. This is probably my favorite ""Emergency"" season, containing many note worthy episodes.What's good about this release; it's a step above cable TV and VCR.Though not all bad, my recommendation lies in Season 3, with more quality prints on the DVD's, better sound and presentation.Universal really blew the enjoyment of this show for me.Whoever cleared the release either had a deadline or didn't consider the fan base. I'm going on record at this moment; ""Universal, find the original prints to make a decent collection"".Both Chet and Marco are given storyline, and the characters of all players become more rounded. This is no doubt ""Emergency!"" at its best, with budget, guest stars (Mark Spitz, John Ashton {Beverly Hills Cop, I & II} Reb Brown {Captain America, Uncommon Valor} in minor guest starring roles), and bigger explosions.It's fun watching our heroes getting out of tight spots over and over, and from what I recall to be the best dramatic sequence using the defibrillator in ""Smoke Eater"". Although the patient in that episode passes on, it also spoke volumes in real life situations, that not everything has a happy ending, and also marks the shows realism and charm. (it also has, for me, one of the funniest goofs; Chet asks Marco for the salt and gets passed the ketchup, which gets used like it was the salt)The best ""Emergency!"" series explosion also lies within the last segment of ""The Mouse"" episode.I could go on marking more favorites, but find it in my heart to recommend this only for the die-hard fans, like me. The print quality is just too poor, (cropped, chopped and scratched, audio at times uneven and inaudible), and will dissapoint the majority of viewers.These ""E!S-4"" DVD's need Emergency! treatment....I will end any further ""Emergency!""

I work in TV and am as much of a stickler as anyone about quality, but I also know how masters can get misplaced or destroyed requiring you to fall back on a syndicated version.  So I don't get upset about the quality, I mean, come on, this is a TV series from thirty years ago during a time when long-term consideration of these programs was not really considered.  Do you think that thirty years ago the film vault techs thought that people would be buying high-quality sets of the current TV shows at all?  I'm sure that the highest preservation went to feature films.  Until recently, TV shows have been kind of considered ""throw-away"" projects, certainly not something that would end up in libraries of the consumer.  So I give them a pass and will continue to gobble up the rest of the series as they release it.I grew up on a single episode of Emergency! - well, actually the movie ""The Greatest Rescues of Emergency!"" - taped by my mom where she took out the commercials and anything that wasn't a fire truck driving or a rescue happening.  I caught it some on TV Land but the effort involved in taping the shows became overwhelming.  About a year ago I finally broke down and bought the first DVD - and that was all it took.  I didn't realize what a great show this really was.  I find it fascinating from a historical standpoint, but also am impressed at how well-done it is.
