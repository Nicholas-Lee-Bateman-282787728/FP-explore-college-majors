1546623,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0085A9INM,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 2]","Just goes to show, once in a while, you can't put too much credence in other folks' opinion. I'd heard of this movie, had avoided it like the cooties because I'd read so many reviews that crapped on it. But I'd just gotten hooked up with Amazon Instant Video, and TONIGHT YOU'RE MINE was on the docket, free for show, and so I said what the fuksicle.3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. TONIGHT YOU'RE MINE (Original UK title: ""You Instead"") establishes its core premise six minutes in. At the T in the Park, Scotland's premiere music festival, a popular American synth-pop duo, The Make, get into a brief skirmish - but more like a tug-of-war - with a fringe, all-chick British rock band, the Dirty Pink. A passing eccentric (Joseph Mydell) gets off his buggy and whimsically handcuffs the two bands' lead vocalists, Adam (Luke Treadaway) and Morello (Natalia Tena), together. Ensue shenanigans.This is where that phrase ""Mileage may vary"" comes into play. As someone who used to frequent music festivals, I appreciate director David Mackenzie's efforts. He applies a v&eacute;rit&eacute;-style filmmaking here. Seemingly in improvisational fashion, his cameras worm and insinuate their way into the chaotic rhythms and scruffy ambiance of this music festival. I'm sure most of the weird-enthusiastic-not sober revelers caught on film aren't even aware they're being filmed for a movie. If you'd ever gone to a few of these, then this film will trigger some serious kicks of nostalgia. Mackenzie captures the vibrant, anything-goes atmosphere and that wild sense of fun and of being part of a massive event.However, if you're not feeling any of that, and not feeling how the film captures the thriving indie music scene in the UK, then the core storyline may not be enough for you. Like others say, the plot's predictable and the characters barely sketched out. The two leads start out feuding and their combativeness lead them to say and do things that aren't very cool. But they grew on me, shallow characterization and all. I think the impetus to my liking them is the scene in which the Dirty Pink has to perform on stage with Adam still shackled to Morello's wrist. What follows - and I'm talking about the showstopping ""Tainted Love"" mash-up - embodies the film's saving grace, which is the two actors' musicality. Music saves the world, which I think is that eccentric in the buggy's point all along. It trumps the film's side notes of backstage break-ups, random hook-ups, liquor-induced face-planting in the mud, and other vapid excesses. When Adam and Morello are performing with their respective bands or engaging in duets (three of them), there's gravitas to them and, yes, dammit, integrity.Also, Natalia Tena played ""Tonks"" in Harry Potter, so there's a curiosity factor well in place as well.",4,"at the T in the Park, a romantic fable",1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,2804,"['Just', 'show', 'once', 'while', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'too', 'much', 'credence', 'other', 'folks', 'opinion', ""'d"", 'heard', 'movie', 'had', 'avoided', 'cooties', ""'d"", 'read', 'so', 'many', 'reviews', 'crapped', ""'d"", 'just', 'gotten', 'hooked', 'up', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'TONIGHT', 'YOU', 'MINE', 'was', 'docket', 'free', 'show', 'so', 'said', 'what', 'fuksicle.3.5', '5', 'stars', 'one', 'TONIGHT', 'YOU', 'MINE', 'Original', 'UK', 'title', 'Instead', 'core', 'premise', 'six', 'minutes', 'T', 'Park', 'Scotland', 'premiere', 'music', 'festival', 'popular', 'American', 'synth-pop', 'duo', 'Make', 'get', 'brief', 'skirmish', 'more', 'tug-of-war', 'fringe', 'all-chick', 'British', 'rock', 'band', 'Dirty', 'Pink', 'A', 'passing', 'eccentric', 'Joseph', 'Mydell', 'buggy', 'whimsically', 'handcuffs', 'two', 'bands', 'lead', 'vocalists', 'Adam', 'Luke', 'Treadaway', 'Morello', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'together', 'Ensue', 'shenanigans.This', 'where', 'phrase', 'Mileage', 'may', 'vary', 'play', 'someone', 'who', 'used', 'frequent', 'music', 'festivals', 'appreciate', 'director', 'David', 'Mackenzie', 'efforts', 'v', 'eacute', 'rit', 'eacute', 'filmmaking', 'here', 'Seemingly', 'improvisational', 'fashion', 'cameras', 'worm', 'insinuate', 'way', 'chaotic', 'rhythms', 'scruffy', 'ambiance', 'music', 'festival', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'weird-enthusiastic-not', 'sober', 'revelers', 'caught', 'film', 'are', ""n't"", 'even', 'aware', ""'re"", 'being', 'filmed', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'gone', 'few', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'trigger', 'serious', 'kicks', 'nostalgia', 'Mackenzie', 'vibrant', 'anything-goes', 'atmosphere', 'wild', 'sense', 'fun', 'being', 'part', 'massive', 'event.However', ""'re"", 'not', 'feeling', 'not', 'feeling', 'how', 'film', 'thriving', 'indie', 'music', 'scene', 'UK', 'then', 'core', 'storyline', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'enough', 'others', 'say', 'plot', 'predictable', 'characters', 'barely', 'sketched', 'out', 'two', 'leads', 'start', 'out', 'feuding', 'combativeness', 'lead', 'say', 'do', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'cool', 'grew', 'shallow', 'characterization', 'think', 'impetus', 'liking', 'scene', 'Dirty', 'Pink', 'perform', 'stage', 'Adam', 'still', 'shackled', 'Morello', 'wrist', 'What', ""'m"", 'talking', 'showstopping', 'Tainted', 'Love', 'mash-up', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'two', 'actors', 'musicality', 'Music', 'world', 'think', 'eccentric', 'buggy', 'point', 'all', 'along', 'film', 'side', 'notes', 'backstage', 'break-ups', 'random', 'hook-ups', 'liquor-induced', 'face-planting', 'mud', 'other', 'vapid', 'excesses', 'When', 'Adam', 'Morello', 'are', 'performing', 'respective', 'bands', 'engaging', 'duets', 'three', 'gravitas', 'yes', 'dammit', 'integrity.Also', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'played', 'Tonks', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'curiosity', 'factor', 'well', 'place', 'as', 'well']",Tonight You're Mine

I didn't recognize her straight away. But I loved her in this. I've watched it twice so far this week.This is a British independent movie called You Instead (US title changed it to Tonight You're Mine. The premise stated that it takes part within 5 days at a music festival at T in the Park (a real festival in Scotland). It does feel like it goes through 5 days time, but actually only 2 days. It's written by Thomas Leveritt and directed by David Mackenzie. The film stars Luke Treadaway and Natalia Tena. It really shows the festival quite good (or as much as they could in 80 minutes). I loved how Adam (Luke Treadaway) and Morello (Natalia Tena) meet and greet the brothers from The Proclaimers just before the guys went on stage to perform. Really liked how they showed part of The Proclaimers performance to ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles).""So as you can see, Tonight You're Mine is a music film with a plot. Adam (Treadaway) is in a two-man-band called The Make. They're a pretty popular band. Morello (Natalia) is the keyboard player for the all-girls-band The Dirty Pinks - whom Adam and his band buddy, Tyko, nicknamed ""The Vaginas."" Adam and Morello fight from the start and are handcuffed together by ""The Prophet"" for fighting. They will predictably get dumped by those they're dating and then fall in love with each other by the end. That's not much of a spoiler because I saw that coming the moment the two started fighting at the beginning.This would be a perfect romantic comedy movie if it weren't for the vulgar Bobby (The Make's manager). I think they focused on him a little too much. And no matter what, he wasn't likeable for me. Especially when he was beyond drunk.Other than Bobby, this movie reminded me of all the music festivals and concerts I've been to. The biggest one being The San Diego's Street Scene - a 3 day street festival. It was a pretty big festival with about a dozen bands that I recall watching. It in no way compares to the T in the Park, which looked like a Woodstock festival. But it's great to see a film that captures the music and crowd like this film.",5,Woodstock Love,1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,2210,"['Tonight', ""'re"", 'Mine', '4.5', 'stars', 'love', '9733', '9829', 'Let', 'first', 'say', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'Tonks', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'straight', 'away', 'loved', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'twice', 'so', 'far', 'week.This', 'British', 'independent', 'movie', 'called', 'Instead', 'US', 'title', 'changed', 'Tonight', ""'re"", 'Mine', 'premise', 'stated', 'part', '5', 'days', 'music', 'festival', 'T', 'Park', 'real', 'festival', 'Scotland', 'feel', '5', 'days', 'time', 'actually', 'only', '2', 'days', 'written', 'Thomas', 'Leveritt', 'directed', 'David', 'Mackenzie', 'film', 'stars', 'Luke', 'Treadaway', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'really', 'festival', 'quite', 'good', 'as', 'much', 'could', '80', 'minutes', 'loved', 'how', 'Adam', 'Luke', 'Treadaway', 'Morello', 'Natalia', 'Tena', 'meet', 'greet', 'brothers', 'Proclaimers', 'just', 'guys', 'went', 'stage', 'perform', 'Really', 'liked', 'how', 'showed', 'part', 'Proclaimers', 'performance', ""'m"", 'Gon', 'Be', '500', 'Miles', 'So', 'can', 'see', 'Tonight', ""'re"", 'Mine', 'music', 'film', 'plot', 'Adam', 'Treadaway', 'two-man-band', 'called', 'Make', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'popular', 'band', 'Morello', 'Natalia', 'keyboard', 'player', 'all-girls-band', 'Dirty', 'Pinks', 'whom', 'Adam', 'band', 'buddy', 'Tyko', 'nicknamed', 'Vaginas', 'Adam', 'Morello', 'fight', 'start', 'are', 'handcuffed', 'together', 'Prophet', 'fighting', 'will', 'predictably', 'get', 'dumped', ""'re"", 'dating', 'then', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'end', 'not', 'much', 'spoiler', 'saw', 'coming', 'moment', 'two', 'started', 'fighting', 'beginning.This', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'movie', 'were', ""n't"", 'vulgar', 'Bobby', 'Make', 'manager', 'think', 'focused', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'matter', 'what', 'was', ""n't"", 'likeable', 'Especially', 'when', 'was', 'drunk.Other', 'Bobby', 'movie', 'reminded', 'music', 'festivals', 'concerts', ""'ve"", 'been', 'biggest', 'one', 'being', 'San', 'Diego', 'Street', 'Scene', '3', 'day', 'street', 'festival', 'was', 'pretty', 'big', 'festival', 'dozen', 'recall', 'watching', 'way', 'T', 'Park', 'looked', 'Woodstock', 'festival', 'great', 'see', 'film', 'music', 'crowd', 'film']",Tonight You're Mine
1546629,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B0085A9INM,M. Oleson,"[1, 1]","From the opening scenes you pretty much know where this non-traditional romantic comedy is going to go.  But then that's the case most of the time.  Originally released in Europe in 2011 as ""You Instead,"" it is set at the T in the Park music festival in Scotland.A well-known rocker played by Luke Treadaway (""Attack the Block"") is half of a 2-man band known as ""The Make.""  He gets into a minor scuffle with the lead singer (Natalia Tena, ""Harry Potter"" films) of an all-girl band known as ""Dirty Pink.""  After a happy-go-lucky backstage preacher comically hand-cuffs them together, the fun begins.Both Adam (Treadaway) and Morello (Tena) have romantic partners who are confused as to why the handcuffs can't be removed.  Me too, but the ""preacher"" has disappeared with the key and the cuffs are made of hardened steel.  There are no bolt cutters around and a hammer and screwdriver won't get it done.  With the couple's model girlfriend and banker boyfriend in tow most of the time, the film has plenty of funny moments.One of the highlights involves ""Dirty Pink's"" concert performance.  Still cuffed, Adam sits next to Morello, who is the keyboard player.  The band is rocking to one of their songs, when Adam reaches over to play a couple iconic notes from ""Soft Cell's"" ""Tainted Love."" This eventually leads to a rousing mash-up of the two songs.  From there on, the couple's distaste for each other begins to change.Granted some of the dialog in the film borders on amateurish, but that is also some of the charm.  Shot convincingly during the actual music festival, the film feels authentic.  The characters aren't always likeable, but they grow on you.  The movie is a brisk 80 minutes and a goodly chunk of it is actual music performances by the two bands and others.  Some of which I've actually heard of.  I'll be searching out the soundtrack which includes Gloria Jones original 1965 version of ""Tainted Love.""

It has a documentary feel, following a set of rock musicians  with a jumpy cam, so-so audio and shots of real festival-goers. The bones of the plot are basic: antagonistic guy and girl are forced to spend time together and fall in love. But it's set up in such a whimsical way, with rich views into the lifestyle of performing rock musicians (and their fans), that the end result is absorbing and satisfying. It has a 1960s Woodstock quality, with Scottish festival fashion, a bit of hipster existentialism, and some magical scenes that can only come from following people around with a camera all night.",4,Unusual and fascinating,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,673,"['film', 'was', 'shot', 'live', 'weekend', 'Scottish', 'music', 'festival', 'documentary', 'feel', 'following', 'set', 'rock', 'musicians', 'jumpy', 'cam', 'so-so', 'audio', 'shots', 'real', 'festival-goers', 'bones', 'plot', 'are', 'basic', 'antagonistic', 'guy', 'girl', 'are', 'forced', 'spend', 'time', 'together', 'fall', 'love', 'set', 'up', 'such', 'whimsical', 'way', 'rich', 'views', 'lifestyle', 'performing', 'rock', 'musicians', 'fans', 'end', 'result', 'absorbing', 'satisfying', '1960s', 'Woodstock', 'quality', 'Scottish', 'festival', 'fashion', 'bit', 'hipster', 'existentialism', 'magical', 'scenes', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'following', 'people', 'camera', 'night']",Tonight You're Mine

He gets close to his high standards in Perfect Sense, but in Tonight You're Mine  his sense of visual style, romantic fervor, and just plain joy of film making comes into full flower. His films have always had sections of brilliant editing, they are often peopled by difficult characters, highly nuanced performances but seldom has he adapted to an atmosphere so well. Much of this film was shot on location at a real music festival, and it is a marvel about how well the atmosphere works. Starting with a comical, almost cheesy beginning -- with two antagonistic characters handcuffed together through an evening; he works toward a totally predictable happy ending with a great deal of invention and originality. And what genuine fun it is to see him move there!  All in all, it shows a very talented director honing his exceptional craft -- he is one film maker that you can have confidence in: you know he's eventually going to produce a powerful important work of art because he keeps making better and better films.

Finally its being released to where I can watch it normally.Its a very predictable story, yes. Alot of people aren't going to like it because of that.  It moves at a odd pace for a movie.  Frankly it moves more like real life.  Its set at a music festival and apparently every scene was filmed in one shot.  It has a very natural flow in that sense but is not hollywood and your basically seeing a video tape of these two dragging each other around and all that takes place with them.2 rival bands get into it at a festival and a security guard decides to hand cuff the 2 singers together to stick it out for the rest of the night.  The two are racing around trying to find a way to separate themselves to they can go on as planned but they wind up falling in love.I love the music and the general spirit of the film.  You also get to see some of natalia tenas musical talents (she has a band in real life called ""molotov jukebox"" their pretty great if you like gypsy steam punk which i do) .  Id recommend it to fans of the indie genre and harry potter fans (because she played tonks).  I say indie fans because most people that love structured big budget hollywood film aren't going to like this.  Its a matter of expectation.

After Morello (Tena) shakes Adam's (Treadway) car in order to make him stop playing guitar they start to fight. When a security guard drives by and sees them he decides the only way to make them get along is to handcuff them together. That sounds bad enough but they are at a music festival and are both scheduled to play and no one knows where the key is. For those that have been following my reviews you may have noticed that I am not a fan of cheesy, predictable, un-original movies. This movie is an exception to that rule. Five minutes in the two are handcuffed together and after about 6 minutes you know how it will end. That said it is still very entertaining and really fun to watch. The music is actually really good as well and the song where the sample ""Tainted Love"" is great. This is nothing more then a cheesy predictable love story but even so I enjoyed it and I recommend it. Overall, nothing new and won't keep you guessing but this is still very much worth seeing. I really liked it. I give it an B+.",4,Very predictable. Very cheesy. Very un-original. All that said this is still very good. I recommend this.

Being tied to someone you don't like is already painful, but this is made more inconvenient by the fact that Adam and Morello have a girlfriend / boyfriend to meet. And Morello has to sing on stage in a few hours.A light-hearted romance ""You Instead"" (US title ""Tonight You're Mine"") is most notable for the way it was made. The film was shot on location, at the real T in the Park Festival in 2010. The audiences and musicians are all real, and so are the muddy ground and a lit up Ferris wheel. Everything in the film including the professional actors looks authentic. And the filmmakers had to shoot everything in five days.I know these things, but still I have to say this. For all the likable leads, energetic live performances, and the real sound and crowd that fill the screen, ""You Instead"" sometimes looks empty, with a thin story that is drawn out and diluted. Directed by David MacKenzie (""Yong Adam"" ""Perfect Sense""), the film certainly captures the atmosphere of the music festival, but not the romance it tries to follow.It is a pity for the two leads so good, especially in the sequence where they perform a Soft Cell hit ""Tainted Love.""
