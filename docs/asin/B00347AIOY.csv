1320854,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B00347AIOY,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[1, 1]","In the late 1970s Frances Schreuder was a New York socialite with deep pockets who donated astonishing sums to the New York City Ballet and similar causes.  But those who knew her well also knew of the darkness that underlay her surface: she was a vicious sociopath who saw those around her in terms of how they could be of service to her.  When her wealthy father Franklin Bradshaw threatened to pull the plug on her financial excesses, she manipulated her son Marc into traveling to Utah to murder his own grandfather so she could gain access to the family fortune.The Bradshaw case was truly infamous, and the public was both enthralled and disgusted.  The case had major news coverage and was detailed in two best-sellers, AT MOTHER'S REQUEST and NUTCRACKER.  Both books were adapted into television movies in 1985.  The most celebrated was NUTCRACKER.  Presented over the course of three nights, it had a longer running time and was therefore able to include more detail; it also had the advantage of a truly extraordinary performance by Lee Remick as the manipulative mother.NUTCRACKER isn't perfect.  Like every other made-for-television network movie, it has abrupt cuts and gaps to accommodate commercials.  It was also done on the cheap, something that most particularly shows in terms of period detail---the story moves across four decades and the costumes and sets are sometimes spotty.  Remick is also clearly uncomfortable playing Frances as a college girl, for which she was obviously too mature.  What with all these issues the first twenty minutes or so feel a little clumsy, but once the script gets Frances out of Bryn Mawr the story begins to uncoil with the nastiness of a rattlesnake attack.The overall cast is very good, but there's no doubt about it, this is Remick's show.  She plays Frances as someone who is perceived as likeable and interesting by people who do not know her well---but is perceived as manipulative and vicious by those who do.  It is a remarkable feat of acting because, while we as viewers are always aware of Frances' monstrosity, we can see why a good many of those around her are not, at least not immediately.  The film contains a good many flashbacks and flashforwards and plays with time as if it were a deck of cards, but Remick provides a consistency that gives everything a remarkable cohesion.NUTCRACKER, which is on three DVDs, has no extras of any kind---it doesn't even have chapter headings---but the visual and sound elements are very good, especially for a television movie made over twenty-five years ago.

1320856,A1K4AVQIU704DY,B00347AIOY,"Nancy Sherburne ""a Phil Ochs fan""","[2, 2]","It was so long ago I read Shana Alexander's book Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder (the movie added ""and"" for some reason) and was overwhelmed by the character of Frances and how she manipulated people from her crib on through her life. I don't recall if I ever envisioned a movie made from such a long book but one was. And it could not be a 90-minute job as most true-crime movies were. No, this had to be a lot longer to take the viewer through all that took place. I was not even familiar with Lee Remick but she became Frances in the filming. Inga Svenson had the ability to create very convincing expressions on her face. Linda Kelsey took on a totally different personality than what I was used to, and did a very controlled Marilyn well. I enjoyed Tony Musante as Vittoria, but most of the cast was unknown and very well chosen for their roles. My heart went out to poor Larry whose vindictive mother threw him out because he hadn't quite achieved the GPA she demanded. It was sad to watch him slowly go mad while his brother Mark did what mother told him to. The long trial interspersed with flashbacks of past actions was indeed intense and you just could not wait to find out how it ended. I admit I don't recall how it ended but I was transferring my old taping of the original airing and realized it would not fit into the space I had for it, forgetting it was even longer than a two-part movie, so I will have to start over again so I can transfer the whole mini-series, and THEN I will find out how it ended.

Lee Remick deserved every reward she received for this movie as you really began to believe it was her life.Frances (Lee Remick) was a problem child from birth.  She had two sisters, one brother and a very wealthy father who pinched his pennies.  All Frances wanted was her father's money.  She marries several times has three children.  But throughout her only goal was to ""get rid"" of dad.The step by step plotting of Frances' father's murder is fascinating.  The trial is riveting.  We could not wait to finish chores & put in the dvd for the next episodes.  I hesitate to give you the details as it would spoil watching the dvd.If you like Lee Remick you will love the movie.
