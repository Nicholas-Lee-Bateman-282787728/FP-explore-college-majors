I'm torn between thinking this as more of an English style comedy, perhaps with a touch of Tom Stoppard and Peter Greenaway, or akin to Woody Allen's parodies, such as ""A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"" with Allen as the depressed director, Joe Harper. The situation is absurd, to do Hamlet at Christmas, when Shakespeare himself wrote a perfectly good Christmas play, ""Twelfth Night.""In the end, I confess that Branagh has gone the way of Woody, and perhaps does better for it. There are only two name actors. The first is Richard Briers, a superb Shakespearian actor, playing Claudius the king, who shows up in all of Branagh's Shakespeare films, as well as others as well. The second is Joan Collins, whose part is rather small, but in which she does a very nice job. In fact, I discovered that Joan Collins began with an exceptionally promising career in theater.As I said about ""Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"", one appreciates this film far more if you are familiar with the play ""Hamlet"". You do not have to see the very best, longest production (like Branagh's ""Hamlet""). Olivier's production would do just find. Just as long as you know the characters and the major scenes.I'm reluctant to say too much more, except to say that you will invariably find the need to watch this film more than once.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[19, 20]","Kenneth Branagh: star, director and producer of a slew of Shakespearean movie productions, including the gorgeous ""Much Ado About Nothing.""But one of his most imposing films was a sumptuous adaptation of ""Hamlet"" -- and after making it, a burned-out Branagh made a movie about the travails of putting on a play. ""A Midwinter's Tale"" is a witty, slightly frenetic comedy that keeps its tongue in cheek, even as it pays homage to the theatre and its people.A struggling actor has decided to fulfill a dream by putting on a production of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet."" However, the budget is very low, the location is in the middle of a rather cultureless rural town, and the actors are... kind of weird. Among them: a health freak, an avant-garde set designer, a gay man who insists on playing ""Dirty Gertie,"" and a nearsighted women who auditions with a bad Debbie Harry impression.But all weirdness aside, they trundle off to the country and begins rehearsals, but everything is going wrong -- they're in danger of being kicked out, the cast is depressed, the tickets aren't selling and their lead is suddenly offered the role of a lifetime. But somehow they have to pull their peculiar little production together and make it work...""A Midwinter's Tale"" is a very bare-bones production -- few actors, few sets, black-and-white film and simple camerawork. What makes this fantastic is the combination of high humor and slapstick, amusingly crazy people and poignant moments (such as Nina explaining why she doesn't want her eyes fixed).Branagh handles the writing beautifully, whether it's funny (""I'm here to play the QUEEN"") or passionate (Joe monologuing about why life is worth living). And though the comedy occasionally dips into slapstick, it's witty and crammed with hilarious jokes (the nearsighted Nina rushing across the stage to throw herself into her costar's arms, missing him completely).And the characterizations are excetional -- no matter how silly or eccentric the characters are, they are depicted as real, good-hearted people with their own sorrows and passions. Richard Briars and Nicholas Farrell are as good in this movie as they are in Branagh's other movies, and there are well-rounded turns from Joan Collins, Jennifer Saunders, Julia Sawalha and Celia Imrie. And Michael Maloney is very solid as a slightly frenetic actor who just wants to put on Hamlet, no matter what.""A Midwinter's Tale"" is one of those unique little comedies that not enough people have seen -- an ode to Shakespeare and the trials of the theater.

Entire scenes are shot in artfully arranged master shots eliminating the cost of set-ups, close-ups, and editing, and distancing us a bit from the action (as in a theatre). Branagh required a brilliant and well-rehearsed ensemble to pull it off.Like virtually all the reviewers ahead of me, I'm a theatre fanatic myself, and smiled at the inside jokes and tensions, but for me the first third of the movie was marred by its frenetic pace. I could practically hear Branagh imploring his cast, ""Faster! Funnier!"" as the actors speak and pick up cues so fast (albeit nimbly) that it seemed as if they were afraid the camera would run out of film before they completed each scene. Things settle down midway, however, when actual conversations (usually about disappointed ambitions) take place, and Branagh allows his actors a few medium-close-ups.

Just like this first sentence, none of this should work.It does.A Midwinter's Tale is not light humor. You will have to have some knowledge of Hamlet as well as some sense of the business of theater. Much of it is very insider even more of the movie is warm.This is ensemble cast work. That is, I was totally taken in by the interaction between cast members, yet there are individual moments created by individual actors. That is, my every thought about this movie is riddled with contradictions. Point is that I enjoyed it.Joan Collins plays basically the same kind of character she usually plays, but her every scene is a small jewel of smarmy evil.One simple view of the sign announcing that Hamlet will open on Christmas Eve, was way more funny than can be explained.Michael Maloney as the leading man, actor director does a lovely portrayal of how to direct weak performers and handily holds the center of the incompetent yet ultimately capable cast. Again contradictions....The scenes from the opening night abound with sight gags, sounds gags and humorous surprises. I suggest it is worth the entire movie just to enjoy these scenes. On the other hand there are charming and touching and fun scenes throughout the movie - and still more contradiction.My one enduring thought is this: A Midwinter's Tale should be a failure and little more than an ego boost for Keneth Branagh. I liked it. This movie is improbable, but it is more than just entertaining.",4,"A small, fun entertaiment.
