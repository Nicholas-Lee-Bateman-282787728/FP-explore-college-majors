1637578,A3CW0ZLUO5X2B1,B00BQNSJVC,"35-year Technology Consumer ""8-tracks to 802.11""","[0, 0]","""Broken"" is not an easily categorized movie. It begins with a scene of intense violence as we are introduced to the three suburban families whose lives will be altered (for worse and better) as the result of what follows. While the issues it addresses are adult ones, it does not do so in a sensational way.What follows the assault that opens the movie are interwoven tales of love (found and lost, romantic and familial), suspicion, doubt, teenage bullying, illness, health, trust, faith, loss and hope (really). These are wrapped around events in the sphere of pre-teen ""Skunk"". Skunk meticulously tracks her blood test readings as she manages her Type I diabetes and prepares to move into her first year of middle school.Among those in her orbit are a young adult neighbor (Rick) with indeterminate psychological issues, the Cunningham family (whose three daughters taught Rick mercilessly) and a first-time boyfriend. Skunk's family is rounded out by single father Archie (whose wife has left), her older brother and a live-in nanny, Kazia (whose fiance is about to begin a teaching stint at Skunk's school).This is a rich plot for mature audiences. Two brief scenes are overtly sexual, and there are multiple instances of actual and implied violence. None are sensational or gratuitous, and all serve to effectively advance the plot.To reveal many plot details would be to invite spoilers. Just watch this movie in its entirety, because many of its characters act in surprising ways (with a range of good and bad results). And just when director Rufus Norris has you convinced that heartache and bleakness are the only possible outcomes of these events, he pulls us back from the ledge.A nice break from films centered around formulas and selling toys.Note: This is part of the Film Movement subscription series; Film Movement provided this DVD for review purposes.",5,"Not for the faint of heart, handsomely rewarding at the end...",1382832000,"10 27, 2013",2013,1870,"['Broken', 'not', 'easily', 'categorized', 'movie', 'scene', 'intense', 'violence', 'are', 'introduced', 'three', 'suburban', 'families', 'lives', 'will', 'be', 'altered', 'worse', 'better', 'result', 'what', 'issues', 'are', 'adult', 'ones', 'not', 'do', 'so', 'sensational', 'assault', 'movie', 'are', 'interwoven', 'tales', 'love', 'found', 'lost', 'romantic', 'familial', 'suspicion', 'doubt', 'teenage', 'bullying', 'illness', 'health', 'trust', 'faith', 'loss', 'hope', 'really', 'are', 'wrapped', 'events', 'sphere', 'pre-teen', 'Skunk', 'Skunk', 'meticulously', 'blood', 'test', 'readings', 'Type', 'move', 'first', 'year', 'middle', 'school.Among', 'orbit', 'are', 'young', 'adult', 'neighbor', 'Rick', 'indeterminate', 'psychological', 'issues', 'Cunningham', 'family', 'three', 'daughters', 'taught', 'Rick', 'mercilessly', 'first-time', 'boyfriend', 'Skunk', 'family', 'rounded', 'out', 'single', 'father', 'Archie', 'wife', 'left', 'older', 'brother', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'Kazia', 'fiance', 'begin', 'teaching', 'stint', 'Skunk', 'school', '.This', 'rich', 'plot', 'mature', 'audiences', 'Two', 'brief', 'scenes', 'are', 'overtly', 'sexual', 'are', 'multiple', 'instances', 'actual', 'implied', 'violence', 'None', 'are', 'sensational', 'gratuitous', 'serve', 'effectively', 'advance', 'plot.To', 'reveal', 'many', 'plot', 'details', 'would', 'be', 'invite', 'spoilers', 'Just', 'watch', 'movie', 'entirety', 'many', 'characters', 'act', 'surprising', 'ways', 'range', 'good', 'bad', 'results', 'just', 'when', 'director', 'Rufus', 'Norris', 'convinced', 'heartache', 'bleakness', 'are', 'only', 'possible', 'outcomes', 'events', 'back', 'ledge.A', 'nice', 'break', 'films', 'centered', 'formulas', 'selling', 'toys.Note', 'part', 'Film', 'Movement', 'subscription', 'series', 'Film', 'Movement', 'provided', 'DVD', 'review', 'purposes']",Broken
1637579,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B00BQNSJVC,Charles Ashbacher,"[0, 0]","The title can refer to the lives of nearly all the characters in this video. Skunk is an 11 year-old girl that suffers from a severe case of juvenile diabetes. She lives with her loving father, brother and a live-in nanny. The mother of the two children has run off with another man and appears to have no role in their lives whatsoever.A young man named Rick that suffers from mental illness lives across the street and while Rick appears to be a gentle soul to Skunk and she has what may be a crush on him, Rick is not what he seems to her. The film opens when Mr. Oswald, who lives with his three daughters in the house between Skunk's and Rick's walks over and severely beats Rick because his daughter has falsely accused Rick of having sex with her. Oswald's wife has died and he violently defends his girls, refusing to believe that they have any bad qualities. Which is not true, they are the equivalent of foul-mouthed gangsters, with the older ones enforcers working for the younger ones in their extortion schemes.The nanny has a relationship with one of the male teachers at the local school and they have fun get-togethers with Skunk and her brother. Skunk lives near a junkyard and she has cleaned up an old trailer there to make it into a hideaway. Skunk is also about to start her first year at the school where the male teacher works and she is terrified of attending, for her brother has told her horror stories about what the people in the higher classes do to those in the lower classes.There is very little happiness in this movie as everything in Skunk's life falls apart. Even her ""boyfriend"", a boy that she has taken as a confidant, moves away. The only real constant in her life is the love of her father, while Skunk questions it, she never really doubts it.The action is nonlinear in the sense that we see the consequences of a significant negative event before we learn how those consequences came about. While that keeps you thinking, it is sometimes disconcerting because you are initially not sure that you will learn what has happened.A hard movie with a soft core, there is really no happy ending as people suffer throughout, there is a small note of optimism at the end, but that is not enough to overcome all that that is hopelessly lost.",4,Broken could refer to every one of the main characters,1385164800,"11 23, 2013",2013,2273,"['title', 'can', 'refer', 'lives', 'nearly', 'characters', 'video', 'Skunk', '11', 'year-old', 'girl', 'severe', 'case', 'juvenile', 'diabetes', 'loving', 'father', 'brother', 'live-in', 'nanny', 'mother', 'two', 'children', 'run', 'off', 'man', 'have', 'role', 'lives', 'whatsoever.A', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Rick', 'suffers', 'mental', 'illness', 'street', 'Rick', 'be', 'gentle', 'soul', 'Skunk', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'crush', 'Rick', 'not', 'what', 'film', 'when', 'Mr.', 'Oswald', 'who', 'three', 'daughters', 'house', 'Skunk', 'Rick', 'walks', 'severely', 'beats', 'Rick', 'daughter', 'falsely', 'accused', 'Rick', 'having', 'sex', 'Oswald', 'wife', 'died', 'violently', 'girls', 'refusing', 'believe', 'have', 'bad', 'qualities', 'Which', 'not', 'true', 'are', 'equivalent', 'foul-mouthed', 'gangsters', 'older', 'ones', 'enforcers', 'working', 'younger', 'ones', 'extortion', 'schemes.The', 'nanny', 'relationship', 'one', 'male', 'teachers', 'local', 'school', 'have', 'fun', 'get-togethers', 'Skunk', 'brother', 'Skunk', 'junkyard', 'cleaned', 'up', 'old', 'trailer', 'there', 'make', 'hideaway', 'Skunk', 'also', 'about', 'start', 'first', 'year', 'school', 'where', 'male', 'teacher', 'works', 'terrified', 'attending', 'brother', 'told', 'horror', 'stories', 'what', 'people', 'higher', 'classes', 'do', 'lower', 'classes.There', 'very', 'little', 'happiness', 'movie', 'everything', 'Skunk', 'life', 'apart', 'Even', 'boyfriend', 'boy', 'taken', 'confidant', 'away', 'only', 'real', 'constant', 'life', 'love', 'father', 'Skunk', 'questions', 'never', 'really', 'doubts', 'it.The', 'action', 'nonlinear', 'sense', 'see', 'consequences', 'significant', 'negative', 'event', 'learn', 'how', 'consequences', 'came', 'about', 'thinking', 'sometimes', 'disconcerting', 'are', 'initially', 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'learn', 'what', 'happened.A', 'hard', 'movie', 'soft', 'core', 'really', 'happy', 'ending', 'people', 'suffer', 'small', 'note', 'optimism', 'end', 'not', 'enough', 'overcome', 'hopelessly', 'lost']",Broken

1637586,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00BQNSJVC,Grady Harp,"[2, 3]","For all the horror films that depend on zombies, vampires, werewolves and the like to place a fantasy make believe world before us to frighten us, none is as terrifying as this very realistic, extraordinarily well written, well photographed, well directed and well acted gem from Film Movement. It is a British product (BBC) and seems to have had a minimal response in the theaters. Now more available to the public, hopefully this brilliant work will attract enough attention to place it in the categories for many awards it so justly deserves. But more important, it may expose many people to the tragedies that surround us and are too often unnoticed or misunderstood.In North London there are three families whose houses form a cul-de-sac: Archie (Tim Roth, never better) is a single father whose wife left him to raise 11 year old insulin dependent, adventuresome tomboy Skunk (Eloise Laurence) and her brother Jed (Bill Milner) and their housekeeper Kasia (Zana Marjanovic); The Oswalds &#8211; Bob (Rory Kinnear)  is an out of control easily enraged father of three loose and trashy daughters Susan (Rosalie Kosky), Saskia (Faye Daveney) and Sunrise (Martha Bryant); and the Buckleys &#8211; Mr. and Mrs. Buckley (Denis Lawson and Clare Burt) and their severely mentally challenged son Rick (Robert Emms). Bob Oswald finds a condom that one of his daughters had been exploring, jumps to the conclusion that Rick has raped his daughter, and beats Rick mercilessly &#8211; a sight Skunk witnesses. This cruel error is the first play in the downward spiral of this profoundly sad tale of how these three families interact. There are a few subplots &#8211; Kasia is dating a local school teacher Mike (Cillian Murphy) as well as trying to convince Archie to marry her, Skunk is befriended and has her first rocky encounter with a boy named Dillon (George Sargeant) and they find an empty trailer house by the nearby junkyard where massive machines toss old cars around like unwanted bugs, one of the Oswald girl&#8217;s secret pregnancy ends badly, Rick Buckley is blamed for every odd happening and is institutionalized, Skunk&#8217;s friendship with Rick involves her in tragic consequences, and more. Every member of each family is broken in some way and the manner in which these pieces of shattered lives influence each other makes for some of the most profoundly moving scenes and themes ever filmed.The story is based on the novel by Daniel Clay, adapted for the screen by Mark O'Rowe, and Rufus Norris makes his impressive directing debut. The entire cast is first class &#8211; this is the first film experience for Eloise Laurence and she is stunning, as are Tim Roth and Cillian Murphy and the rest. For this viewer this is one of the finest movies of the past year, a film so challenging and exquisitely crafted that it should be seen by everyone. Highly Recommended.

This film has won a large number of awards - amongst them, Best Film at the British Independent Film Awards and it was also an opening night film at Cannes Critics Week.Eleven year old Skunk lives with her brother, father and housekeeper in a cul-de-sac populated by only a few families. Hers is not the only family touched by tragedy (Mom has run away). Neighbour Bob Oswald's wife has died, leaving him to raise his three hellion daughters. Mr and Mrs Buckley live with their brain damaged adult son Rick across the street.Skunk witnesses a violent attack on Rick by neighbour Bob who is convinced that Rick has sexually assaulted one of his daughters. That attack seems to be a catalyst, triggering a chain of events that impacts every resident of the cul-de-sac. But none more than Skunk. Her naivete is slowly eroded by the anger she witnesses both outside of her home and within - the housekeeper and her boyfriend have a tumultuous relationship.  Skunk makes tentative overtures into exploring her own burgeoning sexuality, but is exposed to more than an eleven year old needs to see. The violence continues to escalate, following her to school and eventually erupting on that dead end street.Each and every character in Broken is, well, broken. Norris explores the human condition through the dysfunctional relationships portrayed. But also through the good and positive as well. Themes of love, hate, forgiveness, loss, hope, friendship, bullying, mental illness and more are explored.You could draw many parallels between To Kill a Mockingbird and Broken - Scout/Skunk, fathers who are lawyers, a minority being persecuted and a loss of innocence. But Norris puts his own stamp on things in Broken. I started out feeling one way about a number of the characters and found my reactions and thoughts turned around by the end.Eloise Laurence is new to acting, but I predict she has a future in the biz. She was wonderfully unaffected and realistic. Each and every actor involved was excellent. Norris effectively uses single, isolated shots of the principles, underlining their isolation.I thought Broken was truly an excellent film. Not easy to watch by any means - I did stop it two or three times to get up and come back in a few minutes, but one that was absolutely riveting. Five stars.United Kingdom. 2012. 90 min. Drama.

Archie (Tim Roth) is separated from his wife who is having an affair with a teacher Mike (Cillian Murphy). Archie's daughter is named Skunk; a 12-year old who is the most innocent observer of the hell at the end of her cul-de-sac. Their next door neighbor Bob, (Rory Kinnear) is a recent widower with a nasty temper trying to raise three similar bullying daughters. Add the other older neighbors, whose son Robert (Rick Buckley) is the mentally challenged adult who has a normal but unfulfilled sexual curiosity. You have a powder keg of a plot.Bob and his promiscuous daughters assume Robert is a pervert causing Bob to lose control numerous times in viscous assaults on Robert. Archie tries to intervene unsuccessfully with his hands full with his own family. Mike seems to be the common sense teacher who gets pulled into the drama and himself a victim of Bob and his daughters for similar sexual assumptions.Skunk represents the only nave observer in this suburban madness. Her main concern is handling her diabetes and discovering her crush on a local boy who may be leaving town. Her hopeful anticipation of the future is slowly shattered by the daily dysfunctions of those around her. Director Rufus Norris fills a multitude of complicated characters and issues with an unusual deftness that never confuses. This is the end of the road in many senses. The DVD was provided from 'Film Movements' for an honest and fair review.Accompanying this DVD is a US short film called &#34;The Way the World Ends&#34;. It is an odd bird. It begins with a bland slow-paced suburban couple realizing that the sun never came up, yet everything is a shade of `dolphin skin' and the neighbors and coworkers go about business as if nothing happened. The almost comical first part of the film quickly dissolves into a frighteningly sad truth that seems at odds with the original premise.

This is the January, 2013 release in the Film Movement DVD of the Month Club, and will be released to the public at large in the months to come.""Broken"" (2012 release from the UK; 91 min.) brings the story of an 11 yr. old diabetic girl nicknamed Skunk (played by Eloise Laurence), who lives on a cul-de-sac in a very much middle-class neighborhood in Britain. At the beginning of the movie Skunk sees Rick, a young man living across the street, getting violently beaten up by yet another neighbor, Mr. Oswald. We later learn that one of Oswald's daughters, in order to save face, told her dad that Rick raped her, following which Oswalt in a rage pummels Rick. We meet other charachters like Skunk's immediately family (her dad is played by Tom Roth), and also Mike, the teacher and boyfriend of Skunk's live-in au-pair. Given the plot-heavy nature of the movie, to tell you much more would flat-out ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see how it all plays out.Several comments: this is a heavy psychological family drama, and at times very bleak (but never without hope). There are several devastating scenes in the movie that will rip your heart out, so viewer beware. Not having read the book that this movie is based on, it's impossible to compare the movie vs. the book, but if the book is anywhere near as good as this movie, it will make for an excellent read. Kudos to director Rufus Norris for piecing it all together into one fantastic viewing experience. But the greatest compliment must go to newcomer Eloise Lawrence, who brings a ""lights out"" performance as the 11 yr. old girl. Please note that the DVD comes with several nice bonus features, including interviews with Tim Roth, Eloise Lawrence and the director. There is also the monthly short movie (unrelated to ""Broken""), which happens to be an outstanding 15 min. US shortie called ""The Way the World Ends"".

Filmed in the UK, we follow a young girl, Eloise Laurence, as she observes the life around her. She lives in a cul-de-sac of three families, all of them are Broken. One family across the street has a brain damaged son that the parents have no idea how to handle, next door a man whose wife died and left him with three young daughters, all self absorbed and start the lie that ends in tragedy. 'Skunk' as she is known, the 11 year old, lives with her father and brother. Her mother left home when she was small. They have an Au pair, a young attractive woman who lives with them. She is involved with a young man they all like, but that falls to pieces when, Martin, the young man becomes a commitment phobe.One lie starts the process of violence, arrests, commitment to a mental institution and then great tragedy. Throughout this process, Skunk is trying to take it all, deal with a new school, a new friend and the lives of those around her falling apart. At times the film seemed too much. Too much for these three families, do they all have to go through life's turmoils and troubles, does no one get a break? The writing is superb, the acting top notch. Tom Roth plays Skunk's father, a therapist of sorts, it seems he needed to start with himself, his family, then the neighbors.If this is a microcosmic of our society, we certainly need help. A good start is for parents and children to start with a trusting, loving relationship. This film can be pretty gruesome in parts, violent and emotionally difficult to take.

Both Skunk and Scout (looking quite alike in appearance now that I think about it) are self-reliant and optimistic, both are being raised by single fathers (also lawyers) aided by live-in housekeepers but Gregory Peck was a paragon of wisdom and virtue usually ameliorating situations he entered whereas Tim Roth is just struggling to hold onto sanity and his family's safety which is his primary motivation for trying to maintain some peace in his neighborhood.  I suspect that director Rufus Norris in bringing a story about hope in the midst of despair to the Cannes Film Festival unwittingly created a disturbing glimpse into a society where adults find goodness only in the fragile hearts of children.While Broken is both a well-acted and riveting drama, it descends maybe a bit too much into social degradation to be very inspiring and although it has some touching moments I can't say this is a film I'd care to watch a second time.  :o)",3,Tragedy Without Reprieve,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,1309,"['broken', 'dysfunctional', 'world', 'young', 'girl', 'innocence', 'child-like', 'wonder', 'are', 'besieged', 'side', 'violence', 'desire', 'multitude', 'human', 'frailties.In', 'very', 'strange', 'way', 'Broken', 'sort', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'wherein', 'central', 'character', 'young', 'girl', 'witness', 'tragedy', 'i.e', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Skunk', 'Scout', 'looking', 'quite', 'alike', 'appearance', 'now', 'think', 'are', 'self-reliant', 'optimistic', 'are', 'being', 'raised', 'single', 'fathers', 'also', 'lawyers', 'aided', 'live-in', 'housekeepers', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'was', 'paragon', 'wisdom', 'virtue', 'usually', 'ameliorating', 'situations', 'entered', 'whereas', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'just', 'struggling', 'hold', 'sanity', 'family', 'safety', 'primary', 'motivation', 'trying', 'maintain', 'peace', 'neighborhood', 'suspect', 'director', 'Rufus', 'Norris', 'bringing', 'story', 'hope', 'midst', 'despair', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'unwittingly', 'created', 'disturbing', 'glimpse', 'society', 'where', 'adults', 'find', 'goodness', 'only', 'fragile', 'hearts', 'children.While', 'Broken', 'well-acted', 'riveting', 'drama', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'social', 'degradation', 'be', 'very', 'inspiring', 'touching', 'moments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', ""'d"", 'care', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'o']",Broken

The attacker is the father of three daughters `The Oswald's' and the boy he attacks is the son of the Buckley family and he has `special needs'. Skunk (Eloise Laurence)is the daughter of a local solicitor Archie played by Tim Roth, he has a sort of maid who looks after Skunk and her brother, she is having an on/off affair with friend of the family and newly qualified teacher  Mike Kiernan played by Cillian Murphy.Mike is soon to start teaching at Skunks school adding a new dimension to their relationship. She has also met a young boy and starts to realise people are not all lightness and light. Meanwhile the Oswald girls are either bullying others, causing violence or being generally unpleasant with their mentally violent father only a step behind to dole out what he sees as street justice. As the lies mount, so does the pressure and an inevitable clash that had me guessing right up until the last.This is a hard film to watch in places, the violence is visceral, you really feel that they are doing it and the acting is superb. Rory Kinnear as Mr Oswald is just amazingly believable as is Cillian Murphy, but actually everyone of the actors do a brilliant job in what must have been some very difficult scenes to get right. It only lasts for ninety minutes and I said `wow' when it ended, this is the debut directorial venture for actor Rufus Norris and he must have picked up a heck of a lot of tips when he was being directed as he does such an amazing job. I sometimes wonder if I am being generous when I give five stars but in this case it was no competition, easily one of the most engrossing films I have seen for a while - highly recommended indeed.",5,"Bleak, Violent, Compelling and Utterly Brilliant",1375833600,"08 7, 2013",2013,1778,"['Skunk', 'eleven', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'one', 'neighbours', 'attack', 'one', 'apparently', 'reason', 'attacker', 'father', 'three', 'daughters', 'Oswald', 'boy', 'son', 'Buckley', 'family', 'special', 'needs', 'Skunk', 'Eloise', 'Laurence', 'daughter', 'local', 'solicitor', 'Archie', 'played', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'sort', 'maid', 'who', 'Skunk', 'brother', 'having', 'on/off', 'affair', 'friend', 'family', 'newly', 'qualified', 'teacher', 'Mike', 'Kiernan', 'played', 'Cillian', 'Murphy.Mike', 'soon', 'start', 'teaching', 'Skunks', 'school', 'adding', 'new', 'dimension', 'relationship', 'also', 'met', 'young', 'boy', 'realise', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'lightness', 'light', 'Meanwhile', 'Oswald', 'girls', 'are', 'bullying', 'others', 'causing', 'violence', 'being', 'generally', 'unpleasant', 'mentally', 'violent', 'father', 'only', 'step', 'dole', 'out', 'what', 'street', 'justice', 'lies', 'mount', 'so', 'pressure', 'inevitable', 'clash', 'had', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'last.This', 'hard', 'film', 'watch', 'places', 'violence', 'visceral', 'really', 'feel', 'are', 'doing', 'acting', 'superb', 'Rory', 'Kinnear', 'Mr', 'Oswald', 'just', 'amazingly', 'believable', 'Cillian', 'Murphy', 'actually', 'everyone', 'actors', 'do', 'brilliant', 'job', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'difficult', 'scenes', 'get', 'right', 'only', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'said', 'wow', 'when', 'ended', 'debut', 'directorial', 'venture', 'actor', 'Rufus', 'Norris', 'must', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'heck', 'lot', 'tips', 'when', 'was', 'being', 'directed', 'amazing', 'job', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'am', 'being', 'generous', 'when', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'case', 'was', 'competition', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'engrossing', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'while', 'highly', 'recommended', 'indeed']",Broken

Skunk sees and experiences some very troubled and violent events, along with contending with her diabetes. We can see some extraordinary acting by this young girl.This is a 91 minute English film. It has extras with the stars and directors speaking, trailers, and biographies. Sadly there are no subtitles at all. That is always a disappointment especially for films presented to international audiences. There is also a 15 minute short film titled `The Way the World Ends' that is a plotline out of some old Twilight Zones shows.The main film is hard to watch and a bit extreme in its violence and the effect on Skunk. One longs for those who commit these acts of violence to have some sort of resolution and at times the relationship of the characters becomes muddled; but Skunk is able to pull the attention of the film on her innocence that is rapidly changing.I was asked to review this DVD and given a copy for examination.
