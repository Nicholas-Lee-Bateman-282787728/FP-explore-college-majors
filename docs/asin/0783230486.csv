63482,A10GLKTPF3MMUM,0783230486,"Andrew J. DiLiddo Jr. ""Big_Man_Big_Heart_Fine...","[31, 33]","Firstly, I am a man reviewing this &quot;chick flick&quot;. But, I was touched by the premise of the film without even knowing there was a book too. So, my review here is just about the film, not a film to book comparison.I found the setting of the story, an agriculture region of California, beautiful, and the cinematography quite good. It is a pleasant and aesthetic picture for the eye.The cast is dynamite, Ellen Burstyn, Maya Angelou, Anne Bancroft,and all the others! The acting I found superb. Other reviewers who criticize Winona Ryder I do not agree with. I found Ryder'sacting and portrayal of a confused graduate student, not quite knowing what to do and where to go very credible, and quite believable! I felt the director of the movie was very true to the portrayal of this important point in one's life, where one has to decide who to spend the rest of their life with. I think many in our society don't really examine this aspect of our lives and I believe negative reviewers are those folk who have not experienced this maybe in their lives as of yet. I found the older characters reminiscing to their younger selves a powerful device, powerfully employed by the Director. It is quite easy to critique and blithely say the flashback device was over used. But, such analysis, does not give fair credit to the full employ of the flashback device use with a twist in this film. For me, it was a powerful message. The older women, still with that younger self as a component of their souls, was what the flashbacks were about.Truly, an erudite portrayal by all the actors and the director of how we &quot;quilt&quot; our love(s) into our lives. Highly recommended only for those who know the meaning of love in their lives and how difficult it can be at times to sort through that confusion. A poignant portrayal by all actors and kudos to Ryder for the confusion, anger, limbo, etc. of her character. I felt Winona demonstrated a virtuouso range, and those who do not recognize it, maybe have not experienced this range in their lives as of yet. The film is one that I would gladly watch again. I don't do that too often.",4,Quite Good!

63485,A2PBV1899CX3TE,0783230486,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[1, 1]","I half expected that How to Make an American Quilt would make me cry, but I never thought that I would start crying in the opening sequence, before anything even happened. They just showed some quilts with the patterns echoed in the rows of crops in the California farmland, and a flashback of Finn Dodd (Winona Ryder) as a young girl at her grandmother's quilting bee. Though How to Make an American Quilt made me cry, it was a good cry. The kind of cry that cleanses all the hairy and troubling emotions you've been burdened with. There was laughter as well. The kind that comes from seeing the all too human and recognizable quirks we all share. Closely observed by the writers, novelist Whitney Otto and screenwriter Jane Anderson, and well played by the excellent cast, especially the older women. Director Jocelyn Moorhouse could sew a quilt and call it How to Make an American Film. She takes the imagery and symbolism of the quilt and carries it through the film, and in a broader sense the intertwining lives of the women in the quilting bee also form a quilt or a tapestry. Well written, well directed, and well played.Winona Ryder was in her element here. The only thing she stole, however, was my heart. It is almost her trademark to play characters who write, and this was no exception. She is a Berkeley student trying to write a thesis, and has attempted to write several, but always abandons them before the end. She is off chasing another topic, like her free spirited mom, who couldn't stay true to one guy. This time she is writing about tribal traditions of women, and tying it into her grandmother's quilting circle.While her live-in boyfriend Sam (Dermot Mulroney) is finishing work on the fixer-upper they share in the city, she will spend the summer on her grandmother's farm, finishing her thesis. Though Sam seems to be solid husband material with plans to settle down with Finn and have kids, Finn balks. Like her mother, she has commitment issues. Spending the summer apart is like sending a kleptomaniac to Saks. What were they thinking? Though she should have been put on probation Winona is especially adorable as she is semi-reluctantly involved in a flirtation with a local named Leon (Johnathon Schaech) she meets at the community pool. Those beguiling doe's eyes--not even the arresting officers could resist their charm. Leon's family grows strawberries, and later he will tempt her with freshly picked strawberries, still warm from the sun, all the more enticing for being forbidden fruit.It is at the pool where Finn starts to learn more about her grandmother's and great aunts' past lives. Constance (Kate Nelligan), who now scares small children, was once a diver. She had a striking figure that drove the men wild. Constance may be bitter, but she was once so sweet, and her various regrets give her every reason. How to Make an American Quilt jumps back and forth in flashbacks and current time. All of the women have interesting stories, and as American Quilt unfolds, we learn their secrets. Great Aunt Glady Joe Cleary (Anne Bancroft) is Mrs. Robinson! Well, I mean, she played Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate, and we have actors of that caliber; in American Quilt they are even more experienced and have honed their talent to an even sharper point. Ellen Burstyn plays Finn's Grandmother Hy Dodd, and the two sisters share a secret about Glady Joe's husband Arthur, played by Rip Torn, real name Elmore Rual Torn. Rip Torn really lived up to his name when he was found sprawled on the floor of the Litchfield Bancorp building in his hometown of Salisbury late at night, clutching a loaded revolver while reportedly drunk. He told cops he thought the building was his home. Luckily, the actor's troubles didn't prevent him from turning in a stunning performance in American Quilt.The poet Maya Angelou plays Anna, who is the leader of the quilting circle, and her daughter Marianna is played by Alfre Woodard. Marianna has lived in Paris where she received marriage proposals in at least five different languages, but she never wanted to be tied down to one man. She met one poet who she thought was her soul mate, but he was already married, and all he left her was a poem on a scrap of paper: ""Young lovers seek perfection. Old lovers learn the art of sewing shreds together and of seeing beauty in a multiplicity of patches."" Anna and Marianna add a lot of color sense, not only to the quilt, but to the stories of the women who sew the quilt. There is such a thing as a story quilt, and Anna has one that tells of how her mother followed a crow that led her to her true love. The crow was the one key symbol that was woven into the fabric of How to Make an American Quilt that made it whole. Who wants to bet that Finn will eventually follow a crow of her own, wrapped in a quilt, and that will wrap up How to Make an American Quilt?Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)(2000) Ellen Burstyn was Sara GoldfarbThe Cider House Rules(1999) Kate Nelligan was Olive WorthingtonThat Thing You Do!(1996) Johnathon Schaech was Jimmy MattinglyReality Bites(1994) Winona Ryder was Lelaina PierceCrooklyn(1994) Alfre Woodard was Carolyn CarmichaelThe Thing Called Love (Director's Cut)(1993) Dermot Mulroney was Kyle DavidsonWhere the Day Takes You(1992) Dermot Mulroney was King; Adam Baldwin was Officer BlackHeathers (THX Version)(1989) Winona Ryder was VeronicaThe Man Who Fell to Earth(1976) Rip Torn was Nathan BryceThe Graduate(1967) Anne Bancroft was Mrs. Robinson---------------Finn [reading Marianna's soul mate's poem]: Young lovers seek perfection.

In my opinion it would have succeeded more than it did had it been shot as a collection of short stories wrapped around its theme, with several unifying characters present throughout each story. Mostly the stories these women tell here are bitter. The prettiest girl in town, an Olympic-caliber swimmer, falls for a rogue and is left deserted to raise her children. A black girl falls in love with a rich white boy, becomes pregnant, and is banished by his family, never to see him again. I did like how it flashed back into the lives of the older women, especially the time it showed the fiery young womanizing artist of the mid-twentieth-century filling his canvases with wild brush strokes, a solidly attractive young man at the top of his world, and then in the next few moments it showed him in the 1990's as this worn-down old man, physically and psychically dependant on the wife he'd been painting in the flashback, and on whom he'd cheated so egregiously.

63489,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,0783230486,Dennis Littrell,"[3, 5]","Syrupy orgy of social and sexual need with a strong message and some redeeming artistic value, beautifully photographed.  It's sad to see Jean Simmons, who was once a fine actress as well as an intriguing, voluptuous beauty, reduced to this.  Ditto for the other Grand Dames here who fret about and wallow in their past loves while spying lustily on the loves of others.I saw this to study Winona Ryder's face.  She plays Finn Dodd, a Berkeley grad student writing her thesis on the lives of the quilt makers while debating a marriage proposal.  Sometimes she seems to be posing, and at other times I find her as subtle and as natural as a great actress.  As beautiful as she is, I found myself wondering if her interpretation of a selfish and duplicitous young woman was more a projection of her own true heart than a demonstration of any acting skill.  She certainly doesn't give the slightest hint that she cares about the loves and heartaches of the quilt makers: she seems totally absorbed in present titillations and in the working out of the pre-matrimonial angst.  But it may be that that is the reality of who her character is, and if so Ryder plays her to a perfect fit.Totally captivating is the scene in the orange grove where the 26-year-old Finn gets laid by mesomorphic Leon who provokes her to a swooning imitation of a Victorian maiden being touched for the first time.  (Winona's face is VERY sexy.)In a sense the Darwinian nature of the human animals depicted here is correct, and on that level director Jocelyn Moorehouse is having a good laugh on all of us.

It is also unusual in that it attempts to breach the generation divide in its appeal; however its success in this respect is debatable.Finn is 26 and, hoping for some peace and quiet in which to complete her Master's thesis, she heads for her great-aunt's house in small-town Grasse, California. She also needs time to mull over a marriage proposal from her boyfriend. This is an entrance cue for a smoulderingly handsome strawberry farmer (in an unnecessary plot complication) to hinder Finn's contemplations.Great-aunt Glady-Joe lives with her sister, Hy, and their constant bickering is portrayed with sensitivity and humour by Anne Bancroft and Ellen Burstyn. The two sisters belong to a quilting group, who are in the process of creating Finn's wedding quilt - thematically titled 'where love resides'. This evokes something different for each of the women, all of whom - in artificially contrived tete-a-tetes - explain to Finn the story behind their contributions to the quilt. The viewer is transported to a time when these elderly women were young, and through them we (along with Finn) learn that times may change, but affairs of the heart will always be unpredictable.These dalliances in the past are refreshingly piquant; unfortunately this is countered by the film's occasional heavy-handedness. The symbolic crow that leads the women to their true love has all the subtlety of a flashing neon sign. Ultimately however, even if it does perhaps tie up the loose ends too thoroughly, the film will leave the viewer pleasantly satisfied.",3,"""For this particular quilt the theme is: where love resides""",1028592000,"08 6, 2002",2002,1734,"['How', 'Make', 'American', 'Quilt', 'nice', 'comfortable', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'films', 'belonging', ""'coming"", 'age', 'genre', ""n't"", 'leave', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'emotionally', 'drained', 'also', 'unusual', 'breach', 'generation', 'divide', 'appeal', 'however', 'success', 'respect', 'debatable.Finn', '26', 'hoping', 'peace', 'quiet', 'complete', 'Master', 'thesis', 'great-aunt', 'house', 'small-town', 'Grasse', 'California', 'also', 'time', 'mull', 'over', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'boyfriend', 'entrance', 'cue', 'smoulderingly', 'handsome', 'strawberry', 'farmer', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'complication', 'hinder', 'Finn', 'contemplations.Great-aunt', 'Glady-Joe', 'sister', 'Hy', 'constant', 'bickering', 'portrayed', 'sensitivity', 'humour', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'two', 'sisters', 'belong', 'quilting', 'group', 'who', 'are', 'process', 'creating', 'Finn', 'wedding', 'quilt', 'thematically', 'titled', ""'where"", 'love', 'resides', 'something', 'different', 'women', 'whom', 'artificially', 'contrived', 'tete-a-tetes', 'explain', 'Finn', 'story', 'contributions', 'quilt', 'viewer', 'transported', 'time', 'when', 'elderly', 'women', 'were', 'young', 'Finn', 'learn', 'times', 'may', 'change', 'affairs', 'heart', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'unpredictable.These', 'dalliances', 'past', 'are', 'refreshingly', 'piquant', 'unfortunately', 'countered', 'film', 'occasional', 'heavy-handedness', 'symbolic', 'crow', 'women', 'true', 'love', 'subtlety', 'flashing', 'neon', 'sign', 'Ultimately', 'however', 'even', 'perhaps', 'tie', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'too', 'thoroughly', 'film', 'will', 'leave', 'viewer', 'pleasantly', 'satisfied']",How to Make an American Quilt

The story begins when Finn (Winona Ryder) comes to spend the summer with her grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) and her aunt (Anne Bancroft) at a grand old house in California. Finn is a graduate student who wants to spend the summer working on her thesis. She also needs a break from her boyfriend who wants to marry her. She's very indecisive about everything in her life, and I honestly found her part to be a little boring. The best parts of the story are about the friends that her grandmother and aunt share and their involvement in a quilting circle. The quilting ladies are all quite different and through flashbacks we're given a glimpse of them as young women and the love or lack of love in their lives. Jean Simmons plays one of the women, and I was delighted to see her acting again. I loved the scenes where the quilters, are working around a table in the lovely old house.  The set designs were beautiful and perfect for the story.At a certain point in the film, we come to find out that the theme of the quilt is ""where love resides.""

And hopefully labeling a movie as a ""chick flick"" doesn't immediately damn it into some lesser category.  When I want to curl up in a quilt on a rainy day and sip hot cocoa and watch a movie, ""American Quilt"" would be a perfect choice.  This is one of the few times when I liked the movie far better than the book--which I read second.  From the moment that I hear the first strains of the movie's soundtrack, I'm ready to grab a box of Kleenex and settle in.In ""American Quilt,"" Finn (Winona Ryder) comes to spend the summer with her grandmother Hy (Ellen Burstyn) and great aunt Glady Jo (Anne Bancroft) in Grasse, California.  Her plan is to finish her master's thesis while considering the marriage proposal of her long-time sweetheart, Sam.  Finn's inability to stick with a project--she's changed thesis topics countless times--seems about to derail her relationship with Sam.  Amazon.com's main review criticizes the movie adaptation of the Whitney Otto novel for focusing too much on Finn.  I thought that Finn's attempt to sort out her feelings about relationships, while talking to the other women in Hy and Glady Jo's quilting group, sewed the story together quite well.  As Finn is pondering whether a modern, intelligent woman can preserve a sense of self within a marriage, one by one, her grandmother, aunt, and their friends share the stories of their marriages or their most significant relationships.  Older women sharing their life experiences to help guide a younger woman rang very true to life.Poet Maya Angelou turns in a surprisingly powerful performance as the leader of the quilting group.  Her story of how, as an unwed mother, she came to work for Hy and Glady Jo's mother, is one of my favorites.  She holds her own with this great actresses.  Bancroft and Burstyn are wonderful as sisters whose love for each other has endured, despite betrayal.  Samantha Mathis, as the young Sophia Darling, is stellar as the diver who can't wait to shake off the dust of her small town and explore the world, and who discovers that realizing such dreams aren't so easy.As a quilter, I absolutely loved the various quilts seen in the movie.  I appreciated the detail of including fabrics seen in the flashback scenes into the blocks that each woman contributes to the friendship quilt.  The quilts that Anna shows to Finn--including an old slave quilt that was especially designed and made for the movie and a baby quilt featuring African animals--are some of my favorite quilt designs.",5,Wonderful Tear Jerker with an All-Star Cast,1023321600,"06 6, 2002",2002,2572,"['How', 'Make', 'American', 'Quilt', 'one', 'favorite', 'chick', 'flicks', 'hopefully', 'labeling', 'movie', 'chick', 'flick', ""n't"", 'immediately', 'damn', 'lesser', 'category', 'When', 'want', 'curl', 'up', 'quilt', 'rainy', 'day', 'sip', 'hot', 'cocoa', 'watch', 'movie', 'American', 'Quilt', 'would', 'be', 'perfect', 'choice', 'one', 'few', 'times', 'when', 'liked', 'movie', 'far', 'better', 'book', 'read', 'second', 'moment', 'hear', 'first', 'strains', 'movie', 'soundtrack', ""'m"", 'ready', 'grab', 'box', 'Kleenex', 'settle', 'in.In', 'American', 'Quilt', 'Finn', 'Winona', 'Ryder', 'spend', 'summer', 'grandmother', 'Hy', 'Ellen', 'Burstyn', 'great', 'aunt', 'Glady', 'Jo', 'Anne', 'Bancroft', 'Grasse', 'California', 'plan', 'finish', 'master', 'thesis', 'considering', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'long-time', 'sweetheart', 'Sam', 'Finn', 'inability', 'stick', 'project', 'changed', 'thesis', 'topics', 'countless', 'times', 'derail', 'relationship', 'Sam', 'Amazon.com', 'main', 'review', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Whitney', 'Otto', 'novel', 'focusing', 'too', 'much', 'Finn', 'thought', 'Finn', 'attempt', 'sort', 'out', 'feelings', 'relationships', 'talking', 'other', 'women', 'Hy', 'Glady', 'Jo', 'quilting', 'group', 'sewed', 'story', 'together', 'quite', 'well', 'Finn', 'pondering', 'modern', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'can', 'preserve', 'sense', 'self', 'marriage', 'one', 'one', 'grandmother', 'aunt', 'friends', 'share', 'stories', 'marriages', 'most', 'significant', 'relationships', 'Older', 'women', 'sharing', 'life', 'experiences', 'help', 'guide', 'younger', 'woman', 'rang', 'very', 'true', 'life.Poet', 'Maya', 'Angelou', 'surprisingly', 'powerful', 'performance', 'leader', 'quilting', 'group', 'story', 'how', 'unwed', 'mother', 'came', 'work', 'Hy', 'Glady', 'Jo', 'mother', 'one', 'favorites', 'own', 'great', 'actresses', 'Bancroft', 'Burstyn', 'are', 'wonderful', 'sisters', 'love', 'other', 'endured', 'betrayal', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'young', 'Sophia', 'Darling', 'stellar', 'diver', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'shake', 'off', 'dust', 'small', 'town', 'explore', 'world', 'who', 'realizing', 'such', 'dreams', 'are', ""n't"", 'so', 'easy.As', 'quilter', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'various', 'quilts', 'seen', 'movie', 'appreciated', 'detail', 'including', 'fabrics', 'seen', 'flashback', 'blocks', 'woman', 'friendship', 'quilt', 'quilts', 'Anna', 'Finn', 'including', 'old', 'slave', 'quilt', 'was', 'especially', 'designed', 'made', 'movie', 'baby', 'quilt', 'featuring', 'African', 'animals', 'are', 'favorite', 'quilt', 'designs']",How to Make an American Quilt

Throughout this touching and almost magical film filled with poignant performances uniformly,the women devulge their collective life choices one by one to Finn who,not certain of her path in life or her certainty in marrying her fiance,learns from these older women how to possibly choose rightly in all areas in her own life.Each woman has a deep tale of love,desire,betrayal,jealousy,anger and heartbreak,yet each has survived to learn some lessons about love and forgiveness, and it is these life lessons which become the patchwork quilt that they give to Finn.The conclusion:""life has no rules to follow:go by instinct:be brave.""This really is an excellent film and the ever brilliant Thomas Newman has once again composed a heartfelt score to weave into this delicate piece of art.This movie is so reminscent of other films such as STEEL MAGNOLIAS,THE DIVINE SECRETS OF THE YA-YA SISTERHOOD and THE JOY LUCK CLUB that deal with the ""collective conscience"" of an ensemble of women who are indelibly connected to aid a younger struggling woman.I personally am not fond of  the label ""chick flick"" being attached to films such as this.AMERICAN QUILT is a story that teaches life lessons to all people about choices and the learning and maturing process that all humans undergo.Perhaps the most interesting character in this film is that of the tortured artist Dean,husband to one of the women.It is through Dean that we see that men are figures too with sensitivies who make the same mistakes and wrong choices that women do,and yet still have the same capacity and need for love and forgiveness.The film constantly flips back and forth from the past to the present,but Jocelyn Moorhouse keeps every story clear and each character identified and in focus, as well as keeping the films themes ever before us.",4,"""No rules to follow-go by instinct-and be brave""4 1/2 ****'s",1175990400,"04 8, 2007",2007,2595,"['One', 'things', 'Jocelyn', 'Moorhouse', 'films', 'PROOF', 'THE', 'THOUSAND', 'ACRES', 'how', 'direct', 'scripts', 'include', 'multitude', 'characters', 'have', 'own', 'individual', 'stories', '-which', 'not', 'always', 'easy', 'task', 'accomplish.Moorhouse', 'brilliantly', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'Whitney', 'Otto', 'novel', 'tender', 'story', '26', 'year', 'old', 'Finn', 'Winina', 'Ryder', 'seven', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'part', 'life', 'early', 'childhood.These', 'women', 'have', 'been', 'meeting', 'regularly', 'least', 'thirty', 'years', 'order', 'make', 'quilts.The', 'magic', 'making', 'quilt', 'ability', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'enhance', 'other', 'colours', 'wrong', 'choices', 'dull', 'quilt', 'end', 'purpose', 'quilt', 'seeing', 'beauty', 'multiplicity', 'patches', 'touching', 'almost', 'magical', 'film', 'filled', 'poignant', 'performances', 'uniformly', 'women', 'devulge', 'collective', 'life', 'choices', 'one', 'one', 'Finn', 'who', 'not', 'certain', 'path', 'life', 'certainty', 'marrying', 'fiance', 'older', 'women', 'how', 'possibly', 'choose', 'rightly', 'areas', 'own', 'life.Each', 'woman', 'deep', 'tale', 'love', 'desire', 'betrayal', 'jealousy', 'anger', 'heartbreak', 'yet', 'survived', 'learn', 'lessons', 'love', 'forgiveness', 'life', 'lessons', 'become', 'patchwork', 'quilt', 'give', 'Finn.The', 'conclusion', 'life', 'rules', 'follow', 'go', 'instinct', 'be', 'brave', 'really', 'excellent', 'film', 'ever', 'brilliant', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'once', 'again', 'composed', 'heartfelt', 'score', 'weave', 'delicate', 'piece', 'art.This', 'movie', 'so', 'reminscent', 'other', 'films', 'such', 'STEEL', 'MAGNOLIAS', 'THE', 'DIVINE', 'SECRETS', 'THE', 'YA-YA', 'SISTERHOOD', 'THE', 'JOY', 'LUCK', 'CLUB', 'deal', 'collective', 'conscience', 'ensemble', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'indelibly', 'connected', 'aid', 'younger', 'struggling', 'woman.I', 'personally', 'am', 'not', 'fond', 'label', 'chick', 'flick', 'being', 'attached', 'films', 'such', 'this.AMERICAN', 'QUILT', 'story', 'life', 'lessons', 'people', 'choices', 'learning', 'maturing', 'process', 'humans', 'undergo.Perhaps', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'film', 'tortured', 'artist', 'Dean', 'husband', 'one', 'women.It', 'Dean', 'see', 'men', 'are', 'figures', 'too', 'sensitivies', 'who', 'make', 'same', 'mistakes', 'wrong', 'choices', 'women', 'do', 'yet', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'capacity', 'need', 'love', 'forgiveness.The', 'film', 'constantly', 'back', 'forth', 'past', 'present', 'Jocelyn', 'Moorhouse', 'story', 'clear', 'character', 'identified', 'focus', 'as', 'well', 'keeping', 'films', 'themes', 'ever']",How to Make an American Quilt
63506,A2MS6UV7ZGTMLR,0783230486,"K. M. Talha ""Weird Gurl""","[7, 7]","How To Make An American Quilt is quite a charming film. Being largely set amongst sunny Californian orange orchards, there is a wonderfully warm feel about the cinematography, and an excellent (largely female) ensemble cast who make the most of the poignant story and genteel script. The flowing direction of the piece is the work of Australia's own Jocelyn Moorhouse.Winona Ryder plays Finn Dodd, a recently betrothed twenty-six year old Berkeley postgraduate student who is trying to finish her Masters thesis - for the third time. Finn decides to spend the summer at her Grandmother's house, leaving her new fianc&eacute;, Sam (Dermot Mulroney), to continue the renovations on their home. Ostensibly she is going there to get some peace and quiet, but in reality she is looking for something more. The film follows Finn's mental quest for clarity on her role as a woman and reassurance about her future as a wife.Her Grandmother Hy (Ellen Burstyn) and great-Aunt Glady (Anne Bancroft) are the mainstays of the Grasse quilting bee, a group of like-minded women who spend their time making beautiful quilts. In the USA, quilting is close to an art form and some quilts can be worth considerable sums of money, but the film gives the impression that the quilts created by this group are much more about companionship than money. Finn has largely grown up around these older ladies, since her mother, a divorced hippie, couldn't control her wanderlust for long enough to provide a stable home. This is the place where, surrounded by the love of this extended family, Finn feels at her most secure.Finn soon finds a suitable diversion from her writing when a chance meeting with a handsome young stranger, Leon (Johnathon Schaech), tests her fidelity and reinforces her doubts about marrying Sam. As the summer unfolds, Finn watches as the ladies design and sew the panels for her wedding quilt. The theme of the quilt is where love resides, and each of the panels reflects the life and loves of its creator. In a series of vignettes, the formative experience of love for each woman is retold - each of them providing a slightly different different perspective on the true meaning of love. Amongst the many stories, we learn the reason behind the enmity between Hy and Glady, details of Anna's (Maya Angelou) one true love, the cause of Sophia's (Lois Smith) bitterness and the origins of Constance's (Kate Nelligan) affair with Em's husband . Before the summer ends, and Sam returns, Finn must decide for herself what is important in her own life, and whether or not to proceed with her wedding...How To Make An American Quilt is not quite a classic, but it is very good. The theme is simple - how love affects us in different ways, and how we deal with the consequences - but it is still a thought-provoking piece. The mini-stories feel a little too short and perhaps the film might have had more impact by developing fewer of them with more depth. Less is more, as they say. Nevertheless, the excellent cast all put in performances of the highest calibre. Most of the performances are wonderfully subdued - there is a strong air of melancholy which pervades the piece, and more than a hint of sadness in many of the stories. It won't quite have you reaching for the tissues, but it is touching nonetheless. The cinematography is frequently beautiful and the ambience of each flashback story is conveyed flawlessly.

63516,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,0783230486,S. Schell,"[9, 13]","This adaptation by screenwriter Jane Anderson (novel by Whitney Otto) presents us with a character named Finn Dodd (Ryder), a 26-year old college student who has just gotten engaged to her long-time sweetheart Sam (Mulroney).  She begins to realize the many changes that will come about because of her acceptance to his proposal and needs time to think and adjust. She decides to spend three months at her grandma Hy's house in Grasse, CA, which is the center of operations to a longtime quilting bee.  During her tenure, she continues working on her master's thesis (a project of which she continuously changes her topic), all the while listening to the quilting bee's romantic horror stories as they craft Finn's wedding quilt.To sum it up, ""How To Make An American Quilt"" is the quintessential chick flick awash with many familiar faces including Maya Angelou.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning poet stars as Anna, the queen of an eight-member sewing circle consisting of Glady Jo Cleary (Anne Bancroft), Hy Cleary (Ellen Burstyn), her daughter Marianna (Alfre Woodard), Em Reed (Jean Simmons), Constance Saunders (Kate Nelligan) and Sophia Darling (Lois Smith).  Anna winds up in the Cleary household at 16 - pregnant, unmarried and helpless.  She will dwell there until the birth of her child, meeting Hy and Glady Jo for the first time.  Little does she know that these two young women will remain in her life for years afterward, their interest and skill in the art of quilting mounting over the years by Anna's guidance.There is also the story of Hy and Glady Jo themselves and their unspoken bitterness towards each other - we learn that Hy is the reason for Glady Jo's ""self-expression"" all over the walls of the laundry room.  Then there is Sophia, an aspiring diver in her adolescence and later an abandoned mother of three; Em, wife to a histrionic artist, suffering his recurrent infidelity; Constance, a decent woman who endures the loss of her nearest and dearest, left with only her precious memories and Marianna, a lover of many but starved for the discovery of her soulmate.We find as the film goes on that many instances of infidelity exist in the characters' cluttered histories.  Half the women in this movie commit adultery at some point and even Finn falls victim to temptation. Where as once I could not relate, I find myself agreeing with many of Finn's thoughts and opinions on marriage upon becoming engaged - this includes a question in the very beginning that Ryder's voiceover poses to the audience: ""How do you merge into this thing called `a couple', and still keep a little room for yourself?  How do we even know we're only supposed to be with one person for the rest of our lives?""  These kinds of questions number in the hundreds of intended couples as they come closer to walking the proverbial aisle.  I know that I have had my own reservations about marriage ever since I got engaged and many of my questions will never have an answer - I must trust my heart...and my gut.Performances range in the areas of premium to mediocre.  Who comes at the top of my list are screen veterans (and Academy Award winners, natch) Ellen Burstyn and Anne Bancroft.  These two never cease to amaze me with how they can turn a character inside out and make it their own.  Winona Ryder is so-so (as she is in most of her movies) as Finn but she does manage to touch a few nerves with her dark and luminous eyes - those pretty peepers are half of her dramatic capacity.  Alfre Woodard is excellent, giving Marianna a carved edge but a soft core.  Kate Nelligan is also wonderful but if you really wanna see her flex those acting chops, take a deep breath of Lila Wingo in ""The Prince of Tides"".  Dermot Mulroney always seems to play a nice guy that gets taken for granted (The Thing Called Love, My Best Friend's Wedding, Point Of No Return, etc.) and he does it again here - actis repeatus, you might say.  Jean Simmons is a little disappointing as Em, the once beautiful and poised actress now only a shadow of herself.  Maya Angelou does fine as Anna and some of Gen X's more popular faces make brief appearances in supporting roles (Claire Danes, Samantha Mathis, Jared Leto and Jonathan Schaech).This film is a fairly even script-to-screen production and will please many that seek a decent character study.  Of course, you can't outdo a detailed and poetic novel or the insightful author who writes it.  As long as novelists continue to exist and evolve, filmic adaptations cannot compare (though there are a few exceptions here and there, e.g. Dolores Claiborne).

63517,A14HHOT9999Z22,0783230486,"Stephen M. Moser ""The Austin Chronicle""","[4, 8]","Creaking with metaphors, it is a lovely story to watch, with a knockout cast well-skilled in ensemble acting. But it plods along, documenting the making of a wedding quilt that incorporates the lives of each person who contributes to it. Finn Dodd, played by Ryder, at her tentative and mysterious best, is spending the summer with her aunts, while finishing her thesis. She is also engaged to Sam, who seems to get needier, as Finn seems to be getting coldfeet. The quilt is a gift for Finn's wedding, and is a labor of love among a group of women whose lives are intertwined in the northern California wine country, each of them sewing a panel that expresses the theme, ""Where love resides."" But love resides in many different places among these women - from sisters Glady Jo and Hy, entertainingly played by Bancroft and Burstyn, who are exactly the kinds of aunts anyone would like to have in their family, to the prickly Em, and the unconventional Constance. So many different stories, as interpreted in quilting panels, do not always make a pretty quilt, and much negotiating and compromise is the very nature of putting the quilt together, as it is in life. Not Ryder's best work, but Burstyn and Bancroft are delightful as the pot-smoking aunts, rockin' out to Neil Diamond's ""Cherry, Cherry."" Simmons is a pleasure to see - with quite a lengthy career behind her, she doesn't appear often. Samantha Mathis is always charming - it would be nice if things would really *click* for her career. Kate Nelligan is fabulous - I was never able to abide her work, presuming her to be like the kind of tight-assed, judgmental characters that she portrayed. But I unexpectedly caught her in ""Frankie and Johnny"" (with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer), and could not believe I was watching the woman I had scorned for so long. Now I look forward to seeing her everytime she appears. In spite of many fascinating and multi-faceted characterizations, this vehicle does not serve any of these actresses well. One expects Greatness out of such an enormous and worthy cast, but the Entertain-o-meter stops short of Just Okay, and one wishes that such talent had been applied to a script that utilized their collective talent better. The concept of the story revolving around this group-effort is a fine concept, but director, Moorhouse, has to work hard to keep the story from fragmenting into oblivion. Though not weighing in as a heavyweight, the multitude of fine performances ensures that it is fine entertainment on a lazy day.",3,So So,1106438400,"01 23, 2005",2005,2524,"['Creaking', 'metaphors', 'lovely', 'story', 'watch', 'knockout', 'cast', 'well-skilled', 'ensemble', 'acting', 'along', 'documenting', 'making', 'wedding', 'quilt', 'lives', 'person', 'who', 'Finn', 'Dodd', 'played', 'Ryder', 'tentative', 'mysterious', 'best', 'spending', 'summer', 'aunts', 'finishing', 'thesis', 'also', 'engaged', 'Sam', 'who', 'get', 'needier', 'Finn', 'be', 'getting', 'coldfeet', 'quilt', 'gift', 'Finn', 'wedding', 'labor', 'love', 'group', 'women', 'lives', 'are', 'intertwined', 'northern', 'California', 'wine', 'country', 'sewing', 'panel', 'theme', 'Where', 'love', 'resides', 'love', 'resides', 'many', 'different', 'places', 'women', 'sisters', 'Glady', 'Jo', 'Hy', 'entertainingly', 'played', 'Bancroft', 'Burstyn', 'who', 'are', 'exactly', 'kinds', 'aunts', 'anyone', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'family', 'prickly', 'Em', 'unconventional', 'Constance', 'So', 'many', 'different', 'stories', 'interpreted', 'quilting', 'panels', 'do', 'not', 'always', 'make', 'pretty', 'quilt', 'much', 'negotiating', 'compromise', 'very', 'nature', 'putting', 'quilt', 'together', 'life', 'Not', 'Ryder', 'best', 'work', 'Burstyn', 'Bancroft', 'are', 'delightful', 'pot-smoking', 'aunts', 'rockin', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'Cherry', 'Cherry', 'Simmons', 'pleasure', 'see', 'lengthy', 'career', ""n't"", 'appear', 'often', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'always', 'charming', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'things', 'would', 'really', '*click*', 'career', 'Kate', 'Nelligan', 'fabulous', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'abide', 'work', 'presuming', 'be', 'kind', 'tight-assed', 'judgmental', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'unexpectedly', 'caught', 'Frankie', 'Johnny', 'Al', 'Pacino', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'could', 'not', 'believe', 'was', 'watching', 'woman', 'had', 'scorned', 'so', 'long', 'Now', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'everytime', 'spite', 'many', 'fascinating', 'multi-faceted', 'characterizations', 'vehicle', 'not', 'serve', 'actresses', 'well', 'One', 'Greatness', 'such', 'enormous', 'worthy', 'cast', 'Entertain-o-meter', 'short', 'Just', 'Okay', 'one', 'wishes', 'such', 'talent', 'had', 'been', 'applied', 'script', 'utilized', 'collective', 'talent', 'better', 'concept', 'story', 'revolving', 'group-effort', 'fine', 'concept', 'director', 'Moorhouse', 'work', 'hard', 'keep', 'story', 'fragmenting', 'oblivion', 'not', 'weighing', 'heavyweight', 'multitude', 'fine', 'performances', 'fine', 'entertainment', 'lazy', 'day']",How to Make an American Quilt
