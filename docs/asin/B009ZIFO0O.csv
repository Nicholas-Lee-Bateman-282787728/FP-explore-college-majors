1603394,A3MH5QA76M4L2P,B009ZIFO0O,Debbie Mowry,"[7, 7]",I enjoyed this drama - I was needing something on the lighter side - too many sad ones.  This fit the bill perfectly.  Hadn't seen the male lead before but he was adorable.  The main actress was the roommate in Secret Garden and she did a good job carrying the movie - I don't think you can go wrong with this drama.,4,Cute drama with a likeable cast.,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,316,"['enjoyed', 'drama', 'was', 'needing', 'something', 'lighter', 'side', 'too', 'many', 'sad', 'ones', 'fit', 'bill', 'perfectly', 'Had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'male', 'lead', 'was', 'adorable', 'main', 'actress', 'was', 'roommate', 'Secret', 'Garden', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'carrying', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'go', 'wrong', 'drama']",Queen and I / Queen Inhyun's Man Korean Drama DVD with English Subtitle (NTSC All Region)
1603395,A1EBJKTH0V0YKH,B009ZIFO0O,Fiction Writer,"[7, 7]","I went on a spree last year, watching several time-travel-themed programs, and this one was among the best. In a genre fraught with science errors and truck-sized plot holes -- just the nature of the genre -- this one used Buddhist-related magic/magical realism to cover most of those problems. What helps this story stand out is the male lead, who portrays Kim Boong Do, a fictional scholar and administrator, who aids the real Queen Inhyun 300 years in the past, as well as meeting and falling in love with an actress portraying the queen in a modern television drama. The story doesn't work if the viewer can't believe Kim Boong Do, and the actor &#34;sells it&#34;. Caught up in the story, I can believe he is a scholar who is thrust centuries into the future, and I can believe that he takes this absurdity in stride. He looks on the world -- his own, and this strange new place -- with amusement and wonder, and adapts to both worlds as he slides between them, learning modern ways while dealing with historical changes.There's humor and history, sword fights and romance, palace intrigue and comic pratfalls. Something for everyone.Recommended viewing.",5,"Fun, Interesting Mix of Fantasy and History",1379462400,"09 18, 2013",2013,1159,"['went', 'spree', 'last', 'year', 'watching', 'several', 'time-travel-themed', 'programs', 'one', 'was', 'best', 'genre', 'fraught', 'science', 'errors', 'truck-sized', 'plot', 'holes', 'just', 'nature', 'genre', 'one', 'used', 'Buddhist-related', 'magic/magical', 'realism', 'cover', 'most', 'problems', 'What', 'story', 'stand', 'out', 'male', 'lead', 'who', 'Kim', 'Boong', 'Do', 'fictional', 'scholar', 'administrator', 'who', 'real', 'Queen', 'Inhyun', '300', 'years', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'meeting', 'falling', 'love', 'actress', 'portraying', 'queen', 'modern', 'television', 'drama', 'story', ""n't"", 'work', 'viewer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Kim', 'Boong', 'Do', 'actor', '34', '34', 'Caught', 'up', 'story', 'can', 'believe', 'scholar', 'who', 'thrust', 'centuries', 'future', 'can', 'believe', 'absurdity', 'stride', 'world', 'own', 'strange', 'new', 'place', 'amusement', 'wonder', 'adapts', 'worlds', 'learning', 'modern', 'ways', 'dealing', 'historical', 'changes.There', 'humor', 'history', 'sword', 'fights', 'romance', 'palace', 'intrigue', 'comic', 'pratfalls', 'Something', 'everyone.Recommended', 'viewing']",Queen and I / Queen Inhyun's Man Korean Drama DVD with English Subtitle (NTSC All Region)

1603397,A209J4NK7GR9S3,B009ZIFO0O,Lovely D.M.,"[1, 5]","Queen In Hyun's Man is a beautiful romantic show with paranormal elements (time travel on the hero's part), that has a dreamy hero and an adorable heroine. However the first 9 or 10 episodes of this 16 episode show, I skim through some of the historical parts of the story, when the hero travels back to his time, because I didn't find them that interesting. The parts when the hero is in the present are the parts I watch the most, and they contain some of the most adorable and memorable romantic moments ever. This show has a good HEA ending too.However there is no real conflict between the H/h or suspense through a good part of this show, which made me feel that this show is a bit slow. But the conflict does pick up after episode 11, and that's when the drama or dramatic parts come in.Overall Queen In Hyun's Man is a good light romantic show with some drama, and it is one of my favorite shows.",4,So Romantic,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",2012,904,"['Queen', 'Hyun', 'Man', 'beautiful', 'romantic', 'show', 'paranormal', 'elements', 'time', 'travel', 'hero', 'part', 'dreamy', 'hero', 'adorable', 'heroine', 'However', 'first', '9', '10', 'episodes', '16', 'episode', 'show', 'skim', 'historical', 'parts', 'story', 'when', 'hero', 'back', 'time', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'interesting', 'parts', 'when', 'hero', 'present', 'are', 'parts', 'watch', 'most', 'contain', 'most', 'adorable', 'memorable', 'romantic', 'moments', 'ever', 'show', 'good', 'HEA', 'ending', 'too.However', 'real', 'conflict', 'H/h', 'suspense', 'good', 'part', 'show', 'made', 'feel', 'show', 'bit', 'slow', 'conflict', 'pick', 'up', 'episode', '11', 'when', 'drama', 'dramatic', 'parts', 'come', 'in.Overall', 'Queen', 'Hyun', 'Man', 'good', 'light', 'romantic', 'show', 'drama', 'one', 'favorite', 'shows']",Queen and I / Queen Inhyun's Man Korean Drama DVD with English Subtitle (NTSC All Region)
