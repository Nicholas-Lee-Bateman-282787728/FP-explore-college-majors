The body can heal virtually any harm done by a rape, but keeping a rape a secret causes emotional in psychological damage that will never be healed until the girl deals with it by talking about it.  Girls need a social network under any circumstances; it is essential in a time like that shown in this movie.  Parents can show this movie to their young daughters and then discuss how important it is to tell someone and to talk it out if it should ever happen to them.  If a girl has made the decision to talk about rape before any rape occurs, if it happens she will be 'programed' to do that, making it much easier to do.  Also, if a daughter is behaving 'strangely' psychologically, parents might show her this movie in case such a trauma has happened to her to help give their daughter the courage to speak about it.",5,Essential Viewing for Adolescent Girls,1150243200,"06 14, 2006",2006,926,"['think', 'girl', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'junior', 'high', 'school', 'lesson', 'important', 'body', 'can', 'heal', 'virtually', 'harm', 'done', 'rape', 'keeping', 'rape', 'secret', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'damage', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'healed', 'girl', 'deals', 'talking', 'Girls', 'need', 'social', 'network', 'circumstances', 'essential', 'time', 'shown', 'movie', 'Parents', 'can', 'show', 'movie', 'young', 'daughters', 'then', 'discuss', 'how', 'important', 'tell', 'someone', 'talk', 'out', 'should', 'ever', 'happen', 'girl', 'made', 'decision', 'talk', 'rape', 'rape', 'will', 'be', ""'programed"", 'do', 'making', 'much', 'easier', 'do', 'Also', 'daughter', 'behaving', ""'strangely"", 'psychologically', 'parents', 'might', 'show', 'movie', 'case', 'trauma', 'happened', 'help', 'give', 'daughter', 'courage', 'speak']",Speak

The description I read was pretty deceptive, actually.Melinda (Kristen Stewart) was raped in the summer between her eight and her ninth grade. She didn't tell anyone, but she was not a ""selective mute"" as she is described. Yes, she had some problems with the other kids at school, mostly because when she was raped at the party, she called 9-1-1 and the cops busted the party for underage drinking and possibly other things. But for reasons she never clearly explains, she went home and did not tell the police why she had made the emergency call.The rest of the story is mainly about how really mean some teenagers can be, but also about how at least one or two can be nice. Her art teacher is cool but does not fit into the suburban uptight community, whereas her neo-Nazi social studies teacher does.

923553,AIEEK7AHXKZCC,B000A7Q2I2,BeatleBangs1964,"[0, 0]","Kristen Stewart as Melinda Sordino, 14 starts her freshman year of high school under a cloud.  Ostracized by her peers for calling the police during a summer party she attended, Melinda is forced to fend for herself to a large extent.Melinda's parents don't really communicate with her.  Melinda's behavior hollers trauma - the extended silence and change in eating patterns as well as her poor grades are all red flags.  One can cheer Melinda's logical refusal to answer rhetorical questions.  It does make one wonder what the point of rhetorical questions are since the one asking them usually doesn't want an answer.  It irked me that Melinda's parents would ask such foolish questions which in turn precluded any chance at discourse.Melinda has also become quasi-mute.  Only one girl attempts to befriend her.  Heather, a transfer student is the only person who attempts to befriend Melinda.  It turns out Heather has an agenda - she wants to be accepted by a clique (called a ""clan"" in this film) called the Marthas (after Martha Stewart) who are held in high regard by teachers and administrators alike.  In the 2004 film, they are described as ""very Connecticut, very preppy.""  The Marthas are known for doing home ec projects for the community and creating party motifs for school functions.  Heather feels Melinda's artistic skills will give her a leg up with the Martha crowd.There are notes of humor that offset the grim and serious subjects covered in this book.  The school board didn't want to spend money on changing the school uniform colors when the issue of choosing a new mascot came up.  The high school principal is humorously named Principal Principal.  Melinda's art teacher, played to perfection by Steve Zahn is the aptly named Mr. Freeman.  He encourages his students to free themselves of inhibitions through art.  He assigns each student an object to create in some artistic medium.  Melinda's assignment is a tree.  (Landscaping and trees also crop up in ""Twisted"" and lanscaping plays a significant role in both of these books).  Mr. Freeman is a delightful character and is also a sympathetic ear for his students.  He has a brilliant way of lashing out at injustice - he inserts rude caricatures of school board members who have made budget cuts into the school art program.A kind classmate named David Petrakis also stands up for Melinda. He even stages a brilliant coup d'&eacute;tat in their government class.  He brilliantly rebuts the dictatorial tone their government teacher takes when he closes down a debate simply because his students are offering differing viewpoints.  David also encourages Melinda to speak up and provides her with the tools to do so.In time, Melinda discovers her true voice.  The writing style of giving readers a glimpse into Melinda's mind and guiding readers with her thoughts make for very effective story telling.  Readers can feel Melinda's rage at those who have harmed her.  Over time, her character builds in strength and momentum.I just loved it when Melinda, drawing upon her newly discovered resouces tells Heather that she refuses to let her use her to get in with the Marthas.  After Heather drops her as a friend, she has the temerity to come to Melinda when she needs something.  Melinda wisely turns down Heather's offer to redecorate her room and help her with a school project the Marthas have taken on.  After Heather had rebuffed her once in the book, readers will want to cheer Melinda's refusal to accept crumbs from a fair weather friend.Readers are not informed as to what trauma caused Melinda's quasi-mutism.  The incidents and reasons for that are unfurled as the story rolls along.  Simon & Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"" underscores this book.Laurie Halse Anderson is a genius, plain and simple.  This is a very serious and important book that I would highly recommend to families, educators and medical professionals.  This is a book that is screaming for attention for book discussion groups.  This is a book everyone needs as the serious issues it covers are relevant and timely.

Looking through his recent spotty filmography, Speak came up. I read the synopsis and it seemed like something I might enjoy, story-wise and cast-wise (big fan of Steve Zahn as well and was fairly impressed with Stewart's role in Panic Room). I decided to give it a shot and was glad I did, as it has given me quite a memorable movie experience.Melinda Sordino (Stewart) is a high school freshman, who was once a bright, happy student. One night a terrible event occurs that instantly changes that and simultaneously ostracizes her from her peers. School, is now a torment for her as she has no one to relate to or confide in (her parents (Sweeney & Elizabeth Perkins) are caring but unaware of her issue and oblivious to her). She regresses and rarely speaks to anyone, even to the few who try to reach out to her. One person does manage to break through, her new art teacher, Mr. Freeman (Zahn), who gets Melinda to slowly express her emotions through her art projects. She tries to regain the confidence to open back up and ultimately break free of the shell she has created for herself.This movie is definitely not a feel-good flick, but the screenplay (adapted from the same-titled book) affords some light moments (usually from Melinda's observations through her inner monologue and rare interactions in the classroom). Stewart is truly the revelation here as she perfectly nails the depressed and isolated role of Melinda and can deftly handle the couple of pretty harrowing incidents that occur. She is definitely one to watch for in the future. Zahn, usually cast for comedic parts, pulls off his best performance. The scene towards the end of the movie between Mr. Freeman and Melinda in her ""safe place"", was enough to bring me to tears, even though there were barely any words spoken.

I went ahead and watched the movie again (all the way through) to make a comparison, and I found that the book is much better. Perhaps part of it is that the book is written almost entirely from the inner-workings of the protagonist's mind; however, her personality and profound silence are lost in translation in the movie, since by necessity a character in a movie that is interacting socially has to speak in order to move the plot more smoothly. The main thing that bothered me is how the movie changed the dynamics of the rape scene; it made Melinda look like more of a flirt who only wanted to go halfway, rather than the half-dazed/drunk girl who was overtaken by this huge sports jock while she was walking alone and then forcibly pushed down and raped.

923562,A3ML2HRDE3PY5I,B000A7Q2I2,Hikari,"[1, 2]","I'm a young adult librarian, and in nearly 10 years of reading teen literature professionally, Laurie Halse Anderson's ""Speak"" is in a very select handful of young adult novels that I think manage to be both completely contemporary and profoundly impactful at the same time.  Anderson's beautful, sensitive and disturbing book needed an equally sensitive film treatment, and I think they nailed it with this Showtime production that garnered great reviews at the Sundance Film Festival.Casting the lead, Melinda Sorvino, was crucial to successfully filming a novel that is largely interior.  Melinda is selectively mute after a trauma, and grows progressively more so throughout the story, so the young actress needed to convey Melinda's interior battle largely though her eyes and face.  Kristen Stewart has an essential quality for a compelling actor: her eyes are the mirrors of the the soul of her character.  Even though she tends to rely on a stock range of facial expressions, her eyes have great depth that draws the camera in.  It remains to be seen whether Ms. Stewart, currently enjoying international stardom as Bella Swan in ""Twilight"" and the forthcoming ""New Moon"" will be able to mature from teen roles into a fully-rounded adult actress, but despite her youth, she's got the eyes of an old soul.  ""Speak"" was filmed 5 years ago, when Stewart was only 13; as such her command of the screen was astounding given her relative inexperience. In fact, she seems no more immature, in either looks or acting style than she presents as Bella.  Whether that means she has developed all the farther she is going to go as an actor than she shows as a precocious 13-year-old is hard to say.  I thought her performance as Bella was defined by a marked lack of expression, but this same rather sullen, detached demeanor is perfect for Melinda.At the start of the story, Melinda is going to school for the first day of ninth grade.  This makes Melinda and Stewart the same exact age, which in itself is unusual in a teen movie, where teens are often portrayed by actors in their 20s.  Due to an incident that occurred over summer vacation, Melinda is being shunned by not only her former BFFs, but half the large school.  Unlike the novel, the film does not keep what actually happened veiled until the end, but employs frequent flashbacks to the incident as Melinda struggles through a very rocky freshman year.  Since the secret is out of the bag minutes into the film, I don't think I'm spoiling anything to reveal that Melinda was sexually assaulted by an upperclassman at a house party and called 911.  Partygoers don't know what happened to her--only that she called the cops and got everyone busted.  So Melinda, being persona non grata at school, and unable to unburden herself of the truth, retreats further and further into herself.  The only solace she finds is in art class, where an unconventional teacher (Steve Zahn) both encourages and allows Mel to express herself through art.  The relationship Melinda has with Mr. Freeman, and with the art room itself is a centerpiece of the book, and it is not exploited fully onscreen, where art just seems to be one of many things going on in Melinda's life, and not her sole lifeline.  She also is provided with some friends, some dialogue and a set of caring parents (Elizabeth Perkins & D.B. Sweeney), rendering her far less of a basket case than the character in the book.  In all other respects, Stewart captures the agonizing self-consciousness of adolescence in a pitch-perfect performance.  As someone who's old enough to be her mom, I can't help wondering WHY Melinda can't bring herself to tell anyone what happened to her for nearly a year; this novel and film, if they do nothing else, present a cautionary tale for young girls in how NOT to behave in the aftermath of a sexual assault.  I highly recommend that teen girls, as well as their parents, read and watch ""Speak"" together, and have a frank discussion about how Melinda could have handled her situation better.

It doesn't really matter, I guess, since an adaptation should be able to stand on its own.""Speak"" is a good movie, not great. The overall acting is good, but I especially liked Michael Angarano, Hallee Hirsh, and Steve Zahn. There are just certain actors who stand out, and for me they were it.One of the most obvious flaws is the sterotypical characterizations. There is a lack of originality in some of them, and you could find similar characters in other books and movies without much effort. As a story, it runs fairly predictably. Nothing is out of the ordinary, and whether or not you know that Melinda was raped beforehand, it's obvious. That probably wasn't meant to be a mystery, though. I also found the ending to be a bit set-up. I get it, though. The point was for Melinda to have her justice and to have it done in a satisfying way, but it wasn't realistic.Kristen Stewart is okay in this. I know a lot of people think she was amazing in this role, and while she's certainly not bad, I wouldn't call it great. If you've seen any of her other movies or seen her interviews, you can easily tell that even back when this was made she was using her usual tics and mannerisms.

For Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart), has it especially difficult because other students go out of their way to ostracize her as retaliation for ruining a party the previous summer (she called 911 and the police raided the party).  What those students don't realize, however, is she was date raped at the party.  The peer harassment - not to mention very poor teachers - is the least of her emotional worries.Watching an affable, promising teen turn into a reclusive social pariah is incredibly difficult.  Seeing her continually struggle during the school year is enough to make any viewer dumbstruck and heartbroken.  She withdraws into herself, avoiding both friends and family.  The sad irony of this movie is that aside from Panic Room, this is the only movie in which I have ever actually wanted Kristen Stewart to speak.  It's truly maddening considering how perfectly her personality and acting style fit such a role (read: she SHOULD have fewer lines).  Numerous opportunities arise for Melinda to speak up, to tell her parents, to confide in a trusted adult, to scream to the skies.I didn't think cinematography, casting, lighting, directing, or any other aspect of this film was particularly mind blowing or memorable.  It's simply a heart-wrenching tale with average acting, a Lifetime movie with a bigger budget.

So she kept it hidden inside of her as she began her Freshmen year of high school.  Her parents, her ""ex"" best friends, the other students, could not understand her and many disliked her for calling the police during the prior years' event.

923578,A30LMTLC9XVWKJ,B000A7Q2I2,Only-A-Child,"[65, 69]","In my review a year ago of ""Catch That Kid"", I referred to Kristen Stewart as a young Portman/Knightley. Most people thought I was going a bit overboard but with her performance in ""Speak"" I feel even more confident of my assessment. Although ""Speak"" was shot within a few months of ""Catch That Kid"" Stewart looks considerably older, with the Portman/Knightley connection even more obvious. Her understated performance as Melinda Sordino is absolutely riveting. Stewart's performance is critical to this film because she is not just the central character but also the narrator, the entire story is told from her point of view.Cinematographer Andrij Parekh gets maximum effect from the camera as the film is filled with tight shots of Stewart's face and eyes. Director Jesseca Sharzer gets an incredible non-verbal performance from Stewart which is nicely offset by the voice-over narration. Like the narration in ""The Opposite of Sex"" and ""Girl"" this helps relieve the intensity and introduces some wry humor into the story. I particularly liked Stewart's offhand voice-over on her way to the principal's office: ""I forgot that the suffragettes were hauled off to jail, duh"".Melinda's flat and distanced narration is often contradicted by the crushing emotional trauma she is experiencing on the screen, this dichotomy is a very effective way to illustrate her inner strength and multi-dimensionality.Parekh complements his close work with interesting short focal transitions and some good exterior shots. One especially nice one is when Stewart is walking in the distance and the focus slowly changes to highlight a bee and a flower in the foreground.Like ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"", the adult roles are a bit extreme but the student roles are very convincing.Interestingly, the climatic scene actually occurs about 15 minutes before the ending. Melinda's rejuvenation happens during her impromptu hospital visit, her voiceover reflects this change: ""It happened. There's no avoiding it. No forgetting.""  Strong again she dumps Heather, plays a killer set of tennis, and bicycles to the scene of last summer's party where she confronts what happened to her and decides to tell Rachel. The tree that inspired her painting helps tie everything together.Virtually everyone should find this film engrossing, but it will especially appeal to those who like to see their heroines get stronger as a story progresses.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.NOTES ON THE ADAPTATION: A personal visualization process occurs when reading a book that often makes its movie adaptation less powerful and less enjoyable. But it also affords the opportunity to focus on understanding why the screenwriter, director, and editor choose to use, alter, or omit each element in the book. Adaptations are all about economy and efficiency as they try to tell the same essential story visually and often symbolically.In the case of ""Speak"", I think the movie is more powerful than the book as you feel Melinda's trauma more, even if you don't understand it as precisely. The visuals of Melinda's emotional battles are more powerful than any narrative; as are the visuals of her drawings and of the process of her growing stronger as the story progresses.The adaptation shows Melinda's parents more positively but still portrays them as disinterested. The key scene is Christmas morning. Watch how after receiving the art supplies Melinda is pleasantly stunned that her parents were actually aware that she was drawing, then quickly disappointed when they disconnect and start their own conversation about the stereo system, which brings on the flashback of them not being there when she returned home from the party.They wonderfully condense the process of Mr. Freeman connecting with Melinda, the key scene is when he and Ivy are discussing her art project with the turkey bones and the palm tree. Melinda is seated as they come into the frame from both sides. The camera is static as they discuss the project until just before Mr. Freeman says the word ""pain"". At that point they cut to a tight reaction shot of Melinda's face as the word registers and her eyes look up at him in surprise. With that short sequence they manage to communicate about 50 pages of narrative and to say all that is needed about the special relationship that Melinda and Mr. Freeman will develop. The viewer is shown not just that he is picking up her pain from the symbolism in her art work, but more importantly that she now realizes there is someone who is tuned in and interested in her welfare. This little sequence is truly inspired and a great illustration of the visual power of film.",5,Kristen Stewart Should Have a Lot of Fans After This,1125964800,"09 6, 2005",2005,4653,"['review', 'year', 'ago', 'Catch', 'Kid', 'referred', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'young', 'Portman/Knightley', 'Most', 'people', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'bit', 'overboard', 'performance', 'Speak', 'feel', 'even', 'more', 'confident', 'assessment', 'Speak', 'was', 'shot', 'few', 'months', 'Catch', 'Kid', 'Stewart', 'considerably', 'older', 'Portman/Knightley', 'connection', 'even', 'more', 'obvious', 'understated', 'performance', 'Melinda', 'Sordino', 'absolutely', 'riveting', 'Stewart', 'performance', 'critical', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'central', 'character', 'also', 'narrator', 'entire', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view.Cinematographer', 'Andrij', 'Parekh', 'maximum', 'effect', 'camera', 'film', 'filled', 'tight', 'shots', 'Stewart', 'face', 'eyes', 'Director', 'Jesseca', 'Sharzer', 'incredible', 'non-verbal', 'performance', 'Stewart', 'nicely', 'offset', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'narration', 'Opposite', 'Sex', 'Girl', 'relieve', 'intensity', 'wry', 'humor', 'story', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Stewart', 'offhand', 'voice-over', 'way', 'principal', 'office', 'forgot', 'suffragettes', 'were', 'hauled', 'off', 'jail', 'duh', '.Melinda', 'flat', 'distanced', 'narration', 'often', 'contradicted', 'crushing', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'experiencing', 'screen', 'dichotomy', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'illustrate', 'inner', 'strength', 'multi-dimensionality.Parekh', 'complements', 'close', 'work', 'interesting', 'short', 'focal', 'transitions', 'good', 'exterior', 'shots', 'One', 'especially', 'nice', 'one', 'when', 'Stewart', 'walking', 'distance', 'focus', 'slowly', 'changes', 'highlight', 'bee', 'flower', 'foreground.Like', 'Welcome', 'Dollhouse', 'adult', 'roles', 'are', 'bit', 'extreme', 'student', 'roles', 'are', 'very', 'convincing.Interestingly', 'climatic', 'scene', 'actually', '15', 'minutes', 'ending', 'Melinda', 'rejuvenation', 'impromptu', 'hospital', 'visit', 'voiceover', 'change', 'happened', 'avoiding', 'forgetting', 'Strong', 'again', 'Heather', 'killer', 'set', 'tennis', 'bicycles', 'scene', 'last', 'summer', 'party', 'where', 'what', 'happened', 'tell', 'Rachel', 'tree', 'inspired', 'painting', 'tie', 'everything', 'together.Virtually', 'everyone', 'should', 'find', 'film', 'engrossing', 'will', 'especially', 'appeal', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'heroines', 'get', 'stronger', 'story', 'progresses.Then', 'again', 'what', 'do', 'know', ""'m"", 'only', 'child.NOTES', 'ADAPTATION', 'personal', 'visualization', 'process', 'when', 'reading', 'book', 'often', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'less', 'powerful', 'less', 'enjoyable', 'also', 'opportunity', 'focus', 'understanding', 'why', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'editor', 'choose', 'use', 'alter', 'omit', 'element', 'book', 'Adaptations', 'are', 'economy', 'efficiency', 'try', 'tell', 'same', 'essential', 'story', 'visually', 'often', 'case', 'Speak', 'think', 'movie', 'more', 'powerful', 'book', 'feel', 'Melinda', 'trauma', 'more', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'precisely', 'visuals', 'Melinda', 'emotional', 'battles', 'are', 'more', 'powerful', 'narrative', 'are', 'visuals', 'drawings', 'process', 'growing', 'stronger', 'story', 'progresses.The', 'adaptation', 'Melinda', 'parents', 'more', 'positively', 'still', 'disinterested', 'key', 'scene', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'Watch', 'how', 'receiving', 'art', 'supplies', 'Melinda', 'pleasantly', 'stunned', 'parents', 'were', 'actually', 'aware', 'was', 'drawing', 'then', 'quickly', 'disappointed', 'when', 'disconnect', 'start', 'own', 'conversation', 'stereo', 'system', 'flashback', 'not', 'being', 'there', 'when', 'returned', 'home', 'party.They', 'wonderfully', 'process', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'connecting', 'Melinda', 'key', 'scene', 'when', 'Ivy', 'are', 'discussing', 'art', 'project', 'turkey', 'bones', 'palm', 'tree', 'Melinda', 'seated', 'come', 'frame', 'sides', 'camera', 'static', 'discuss', 'project', 'just', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'word', 'pain', 'point', 'cut', 'tight', 'reaction', 'shot', 'Melinda', 'face', 'word', 'registers', 'eyes', 'look', 'up', 'surprise', 'short', 'sequence', 'manage', 'communicate', '50', 'pages', 'narrative', 'say', 'needed', 'special', 'relationship', 'Melinda', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'will', 'develop', 'viewer', 'shown', 'not', 'just', 'picking', 'up', 'pain', 'symbolism', 'art', 'work', 'more', 'importantly', 'now', 'someone', 'who', 'tuned', 'interested', 'welfare', 'little', 'sequence', 'truly', 'inspired', 'great', 'illustration', 'visual', 'power', 'film']",Speak
923579,AUDSM2CTLLW1Q,B000A7Q2I2,Patrick L. Randall,"[117, 119]","""Speak"" tells the story of a girl, Melinda Sordino (Kristen Stewart), who made it through the end of the difficult middle school years as one of the popular girls.  She does not appear to be conceited or stuck up; she's only just a girl who enjoys the fact that she and her girlfriends are well thought of and the center of the social scene.  That all changes for Melinda at a summer party thrown at a friends house where she gets friendly with a popular high school jock only to be shockingly date raped by him.  In her shock after the rape, Melinda tries to call the police from the party house, but that just leads to the cops showing up and breaking up the party and getting a lot of Melinda's friends in trouble.  Not knowing why Melinda really called the police leads her group of friends, especially her best friend Rachel (Hallee Hirsch) to ostracize her in the way that kids that age lash out at anything that they don't understand and challenges their socially accepted norms.  Melinda is also hindered by the fact that her parents, despite clearly loving her, are too caught up in their own issues to recognize that their daughter just underwent a tremendous trauma.When high school begins that fall, Melinda selectively chooses to remain a mute while enduring the hateful behaviors of her former friends (including Rachel, who is now dating the guy that raped Melinda).  Yet, slowly, through finding herself through an art class with and an art teacher (Steve Zahn) that truly inspire her, Melinda manages to recover and find a new sense of self and confidence and even resolution to the events that have plagued her.""Speak"" has all the makings of a typical after school special that is rife with pretentiousness and pat resolutions.  Yet, it manages to transcend that genre and make for a truly moving film.  The performance of Kristen Stewart and, to a lesser extent, Steve Zahn, is truly remarkable.  Zahn is a known quantity in Hollywood and his performance as art teacher, Mr. Freeman, is full of the pathos we've come to expect from him.  Stewart, who was only 13 when she filmed this role, is simply stunning.  She took a role that actress three times her would find daunting and, not only fulfilled it, but so thoroughly mastered it, that she made it her own.It's ironic that Stewart played Jodie Foster's daughter in the hit thriller ""Panic Room"", because she evokes memories of a Jodie Foster from 30 years ago.  Stewart has the same physical look and mannerisms and definitely shows the potential to have the same acting talent.  I look forward to seeing more films starring Kristen Stewart.  I think she will turn out to be a real Hollywood gem and, anyone who has seen ""Speak"", will remember the exact moment when Kristen Stewart gave notice that she had arrived.",5,Fantastic coming out role for young Kristen Stewart,1140220800,"02 18, 2006",2006,2788,"['Speak', 'story', 'girl', 'Melinda', 'Sordino', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'made', 'end', 'difficult', 'middle', 'school', 'years', 'one', 'popular', 'girls', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'conceited', 'stuck', 'up', 'only', 'just', 'girl', 'who', 'fact', 'girlfriends', 'are', 'well', 'thought', 'center', 'social', 'scene', 'changes', 'Melinda', 'summer', 'party', 'thrown', 'friends', 'house', 'where', 'friendly', 'popular', 'high', 'school', 'jock', 'only', 'be', 'shockingly', 'date', 'raped', 'shock', 'rape', 'Melinda', 'call', 'police', 'party', 'house', 'just', 'cops', 'showing', 'up', 'breaking', 'up', 'party', 'getting', 'lot', 'Melinda', 'friends', 'trouble', 'Not', 'knowing', 'why', 'Melinda', 'really', 'called', 'police', 'group', 'friends', 'especially', 'best', 'friend', 'Rachel', 'Hallee', 'Hirsch', 'ostracize', 'way', 'kids', 'age', 'out', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'challenges', 'socially', 'accepted', 'norms', 'Melinda', 'also', 'hindered', 'fact', 'parents', 'clearly', 'loving', 'are', 'too', 'caught', 'up', 'own', 'issues', 'recognize', 'daughter', 'just', 'underwent', 'tremendous', 'trauma.When', 'high', 'school', 'fall', 'Melinda', 'selectively', 'remain', 'mute', 'enduring', 'hateful', 'behaviors', 'former', 'friends', 'including', 'Rachel', 'who', 'now', 'dating', 'guy', 'raped', 'Melinda', 'slowly', 'finding', 'art', 'class', 'art', 'teacher', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'truly', 'inspire', 'Melinda', 'recover', 'find', 'new', 'sense', 'self', 'confidence', 'even', 'resolution', 'events', 'have', 'plagued', 'Speak', 'makings', 'typical', 'school', 'special', 'rife', 'pretentiousness', 'pat', 'resolutions', 'Yet', 'transcend', 'genre', 'make', 'truly', 'moving', 'film', 'performance', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Steve', 'Zahn', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'Zahn', 'known', 'quantity', 'Hollywood', 'performance', 'art', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'full', 'pathos', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'Stewart', 'who', 'was', 'only', '13', 'when', 'filmed', 'role', 'simply', 'stunning', 'took', 'role', 'actress', 'three', 'times', 'would', 'find', 'daunting', 'not', 'only', 'fulfilled', 'so', 'thoroughly', 'mastered', 'made', 'own.It', 'ironic', 'Stewart', 'played', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'daughter', 'hit', 'thriller', 'Panic', 'Room', 'memories', 'Jodie', 'Foster', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Stewart', 'same', 'physical', 'look', 'mannerisms', 'definitely', 'potential', 'have', 'same', 'acting', 'talent', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'films', 'starring', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'think', 'will', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'real', 'Hollywood', 'gem', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'Speak', 'will', 'remember', 'exact', 'moment', 'when', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'gave', 'notice', 'had', 'arrived']",Speak

A young girl is raped at a party and is subsequently unable to talk about it or even tell anyone what happened, consequently becoming subdued and nearly mute as the viewer gets an insight into her personality via her often sardonic thoughts.  This film does pretty decently at showing us the difficulties such a trauma can inflict on a teenaged girl, this one played by Kristen Stewart.  This film could have gone the route of the preachy, corny, uninteresting story, but it didn't.  It handled the problem as we would in the real world...for the most part.  I won't fault any of the other characters for not relishing what happened to our leading lady...it is an unfortunate truth that sexual assaults often go unreported and it probably wouldn't be the first to come to anyone's mind.  I guess my only problem with this film is that, given the subject matter, it ended a little too perfectly...barely a hint of ambiguity.

Melinda's story may be harder for some people to take than others, particularly if they have been victimized themselves and feel that maybe they are somehow to blame when the immediate aftermath around them is negative.There is no sugar coating here:  One day Melinda (Played with incredible depth and sensitivity by Kristen Stewart.) is a fun-loving teen, and the next she can never look at anything the same way again.  I was angry throughout the film because her suppposed friends should have guessed it took more than calling the cops at a party to turn her into a social outcast.  In fact, her behavior could have told a very perceptive stranger what was wrong, but nobody noticed except one male student and Steve Zahn's art teacher character Mr. Freeman.  Everyone else was cruel and/or indifferent, and that's before they found out what happened to her.This is the story of one year in the life of a bright young girl after a very troubling incident but, unlike other victims, she didn't keep silent about it for years until her entire life was a complete mess.  It is incredibly moving and well-done.  If you are having some of the same problems, please don't wait until you have a mountain of trouble ahead of you.

A girl beginning her freshman year in high school, and who is mentally distressed over a tragic event that happened to her the previous summer.  Melina Sordino was date raped at a summer party, left justly terrified and confused; she called the police while at the party. Not telling anyone what really happened, her so called ""friends"" began calling her a snitch and tattle tale for ruining the party. The movie depicts how she begins her freshman year, continuing to be ridiculed by former friends; Melina is left feeling isolated and takes some sort of refuge by allowing herself to associate with a self centered girl she really don't like, as well as occasionally hiding out in an old abandoned janitor's room at school. Melina also finds some acceptance and therapeutic escape within her Art class and teacher, Mr. Freeman, played by Steve Zahn.The story depicts the emotional impact that comes with such a tragedy, and how Melina finally begins to realize that if she talks about what happened to someone/anyone, she can some how move forward. And even though the plot is strong, the movie mainly focuses on the emotional scars that were left by the tragedy, and how Melina deals with her feelings of depression/anger/isolation the following freshman year.",5,A serious plot worth watching,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,1325,"['Kristen', 'Stewart', 'portrayed', 'credible', 'role', 'Melina', 'Sordino', 'A', 'girl', 'beginning', 'freshman', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'who', 'mentally', 'distressed', 'over', 'tragic', 'event', 'happened', 'previous', 'summer', 'Melina', 'Sordino', 'was', 'date', 'raped', 'summer', 'party', 'left', 'justly', 'terrified', 'confused', 'called', 'police', 'party', 'Not', 'telling', 'anyone', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'so', 'called', 'friends', 'began', 'calling', 'snitch', 'tattle', 'tale', 'ruining', 'party', 'movie', 'how', 'freshman', 'year', 'continuing', 'be', 'ridiculed', 'former', 'friends', 'Melina', 'left', 'feeling', 'isolated', 'sort', 'refuge', 'allowing', 'associate', 'self', 'centered', 'girl', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'as', 'well', 'occasionally', 'hiding', 'out', 'old', 'abandoned', 'janitor', 'room', 'school', 'Melina', 'also', 'acceptance', 'therapeutic', 'escape', 'Art', 'class', 'teacher', 'Mr.', 'Freeman', 'played', 'Steve', 'Zahn.The', 'story', 'emotional', 'impact', 'such', 'tragedy', 'how', 'Melina', 'finally', 'realize', 'what', 'happened', 'someone/anyone', 'can', 'how', 'move', 'forward', 'even', 'plot', 'strong', 'movie', 'mainly', 'emotional', 'scars', 'were', 'left', 'tragedy', 'how', 'Melina', 'feelings', 'depression/anger/isolation', 'following', 'freshman', 'year']",Speak

923594,A3028S6C0F8BF0,B000A7Q2I2,"W.W. Nowe ""enggs""","[7, 7]","This movie is surprising for a couple of reasons. First, it's surprising how sad it really is. The movie starts off following a girl on her first day of high school. She is an attractive girl. She seems to be a genuinely nice person who is intelligent and introspective. All this makes it hard to understand why she is shunned and tormented by the other students. It's difficult to watch as their behavior towards her continues day after day throughout the school year.This would have been an effective movie if it just dealt with the problem of teenage harassment and bullying, but it really takes it up a notch about halfway through where it reveals that all of the abuse is over a tragic misunderstanding.While at a high school party, the previous summer, the girl was date raped by an older boy. She called 911 for help but was unable to say anything and hung up the phone. 911 sent cops to the house who then promptly raided the party. No one knew what really happened so the girl was labeled a squealer and blamed for the raid.Knowing this doesn't just make the rest of the film more difficult to watch, it makes all of the abuse seen previously feel that much worse.There are many times throughout the move where she should stand up and speak out for herself but doesn't. Whether it's on the phone with 911, or a power mad teacher who gives her a demerit for tardiness on the first day of school when she can't find her class, or with a boy in her class who she likes, or with her loving but clueless parents, or with her ex-best friends who turned their backs on her after the party. The trauma she suffered has left her timid and withdrawn, and unable to find her voice.This leads me to the second thing that surprised me: the ending. I disagree with previous reviews that say it ended too soon. The ending is short and abrupt, but it's also surprisingly uplifting and perfect in it's simplicity. It ends with the girl finally being able to open up and talk (hence, the title of the movie) about the rape. It might not seem like much but it's a victory she'd been fighting for the entire film.A really good movie.",4,Surprising,1128816000,"10 9, 2005",2005,2122,"['movie', 'surprising', 'couple', 'reasons', 'First', 'surprising', 'how', 'sad', 'really', 'movie', 'off', 'following', 'girl', 'first', 'day', 'high', 'school', 'attractive', 'girl', 'be', 'genuinely', 'nice', 'person', 'who', 'intelligent', 'introspective', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'shunned', 'tormented', 'other', 'students', 'difficult', 'watch', 'behavior', 'day', 'day', 'school', 'year.This', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'movie', 'just', 'dealt', 'problem', 'teenage', 'harassment', 'bullying', 'really', 'up', 'notch', 'halfway', 'where', 'abuse', 'tragic', 'misunderstanding.While', 'high', 'school', 'party', 'previous', 'summer', 'girl', 'was', 'date', 'raped', 'older', 'boy', 'called', '911', 'help', 'was', 'unable', 'say', 'anything', 'hung', 'up', 'phone', '911', 'sent', 'cops', 'house', 'who', 'then', 'promptly', 'raided', 'party', 'one', 'knew', 'what', 'really', 'happened', 'so', 'girl', 'was', 'labeled', 'squealer', 'blamed', 'raid.Knowing', ""n't"", 'just', 'make', 'rest', 'film', 'more', 'difficult', 'watch', 'abuse', 'seen', 'previously', 'feel', 'much', 'are', 'many', 'times', 'move', 'where', 'should', 'stand', 'up', 'speak', 'out', ""n't"", 'Whether', 'phone', '911', 'power', 'mad', 'teacher', 'who', 'demerit', 'tardiness', 'first', 'day', 'school', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'class', 'boy', 'class', 'who', 'loving', 'clueless', 'parents', 'ex-best', 'friends', 'who', 'turned', 'backs', 'party', 'trauma', 'suffered', 'left', 'timid', 'withdrawn', 'unable', 'find', 'voice.This', 'second', 'thing', 'surprised', 'ending', 'disagree', 'previous', 'reviews', 'say', 'ended', 'too', 'soon', 'ending', 'short', 'abrupt', 'also', 'surprisingly', 'uplifting', 'perfect', 'simplicity', 'girl', 'finally', 'being', 'able', 'open', 'up', 'talk', 'hence', 'title', 'movie', 'rape', 'might', 'not', 'seem', 'much', 'victory', ""'d"", 'been', 'fighting', 'entire', 'film.A', 'really', 'good', 'movie']",Speak
