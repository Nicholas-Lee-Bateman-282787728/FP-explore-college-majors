None of thecharacters gets what they deserve and none seem to have any real conception of life or fun.  This film is painful to watch and shows only the dark grim side of life for these kids.  Is there a light side?  I don't know, should it show a light side, should it have even a single character we can feel sympathy for?  NO.  The film is very pure and plays very strictly by it's own rules, pulling no punches. whether it's stupidity, drug use brutality or the rape of a minor there is no turning away, and no polite little nods to help you accept that this only a movie. Whether you believe that people like this exist or not, the movie doesn't care, as far as it is concerned they do and having made that decission it plays entirely fair, maybe too much so.

The life of teenagers in America today, all the drugs, the alcohol, the illicit sex, and the dangers and diseases that follow.  The film follows a group of kids in present-day New York through the course of a typical day of alcoholism and narcotics abuse.  During the film, these NY teens engage in all the actions that your mother warned you about which culminate in a party at the end of the film that will stay with you for a long time.  There are some great performances by some up-and-coming actors, especially Chloe Sevigny and Justin Pierce.  Unfortunately Pierce hung himself in 2000, so we'll see no more of &quot;Casper&quot;, although he did have a minor role in &quot;Next Friday&quot;.  I found the music in &quot;Kids&quot; to be quite compelling, and the visuals by Larry Clark are something to behold.

But then again, the REASONS for that disgust or anger is because the movie is believable.It's a kind of rough film, edited in a way that it seems kind of gritty, with home video feel to it.  The story is of the idle time of kids essentially on the streets in New York and is also kind of a ""coming of age"" film, with a HUGE twist.It also is a movie to show the dangers of sex, drugs and alcohol, and it does so through the tales of numerous kids in the story, most notebly Telly (played by Leo Fitzpatrick), his friend Casper, and also characters played by Rosario Dawson and Chloe Sevegny.  It's hauntingly believable and the ""surprise ending"" is both disgusting and kind of fitting.I'd recommend this movie to anyone, but I don't think I could OWN it.  It's kind of one of those things you're happy you've seen, but also glad you don't HAVE to see it again.  Powerful and painful in one blow, this is a completely unforgettable movie.

I knew it would be a hard film to watch; that's an  understatement.  You'll find some interesting parts of the film that may  bring back some adolescent feelings of insecurity and curiousity about sex.  I think we all harbored these feelings to some extent when when we were  teenagers.  What really hit me hard is the main focus of the movie: STDs.

The reason I classify this movie as a documentary is not only because of the reality of it, but the lack of enjoyment I get out of watching it.  It is not entertainment, but a real look at what youth has come to in the USA.  If you are looking for a movie that has entertainment value, this is not the one for you.  Sex, STDs, drugs, and violence are the basic aspects of the film.  The plot is not very good and the conflict is never resolved.  I would highly suggest this movie to parents who don't think anything about their kids never being at home.  I do think that the author downgrades the anger and violence(only one scene in the movie displays actual violence) that kids have and upgraded the sex portion of the movie.

With all the controversy surrounding it, I was curious to see what it was like.It was attempting to use the shock value of showing all the adolecent stereotypes in order to give some sort of cautionary tale of todays youth, in the end though it doesn't really work.They take a large number of stories of delinquent kids and follow them around for the day.  One of them has a thing for deflowering virgins, what he doesn't know is that he has AIDS as he goes on to his next conquest.  His friends wander around the town, skate, steal alcohol, get into fights, and try to get laid as much as possible.Two problems that I had with this movie.  Even though it was using graphic language and more graphic scenes than most movies, it just wan't that shocking or interesting.I think that might be due to experiencing a lot of the stories in High School.  The guy that has to go around and get laid as much as possible, or a guy that likes to deflower young women.  The group of kids that wanders around shoplifting and partying whenever they get the chance.  etc......Second of all, none of the actors had an ounce of charisma.  The main character not only came off as extremely stupid, but ugly as well.  Being neither suave or good looking it is hard to believe that he would be so talented at his hobby.  The fact that he talks like he has either a head injury, suffers developmental problems,  or is addicted to qualudes makes it even harder to fathom.His friends suffer from the same problems; dull, poorly acted, unrealistic, etc......This is a movie that tries very hard to shock, too hard.  I think this is what destroys the plot which could have been interesting.  But I think it also suffers from the problem of been there done that.  We have seen movies that are tales of what kids are capable of for years; Blackboard Jungle, Class of 1984, Bad Boys,  A Clockwork Orange, etc......  So this is old territory, and he might be able to get a new spin off of it, but wouldn't delve into new grounds.All that said, don't expect much that you haven't seen in another movie.

416044,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304346158,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 1]","So, tonight I finally was able to see the film that everyone has been talking about this year; `Spring Breakers'.  It's been a long time coming.  I should have seen it in the theaters, I know, but my life is far too hectic and busy to allow for that kind of thing.  When you have three children it appears that unless it's a cartoon, I don't get to the theater to see it (an exaggeration, but not a very big one).  I've refrained from reading very many reviews, mostly because I didn't want to spoil for myself what was bound to be the highlight of my cinematic year.Right?Before watching `Spring Breakers', I sat down to watch Harmony Korine's very first film; `Kids'.  While he didn't direct it, he wrote the screenplay at the ripe old age of 19, and so I was interested to see how these two bookends complimented one another.  I must say, watching these two films back to back brought so much perspective to both features and helped highlight the raw honesty of Korine's vision.  Despite being 18 years apart, the themes and even the way in which those themes are expressed and expounded on show the bleakness of youth and their culture and how little it has evolved over the years.""Life is short.""  A taxi driver makes that statement to a grief stricken Chloe Sevigny in `Kids' and that very statement, while a very common one, makes itself extremely prevalent in both of these features.  The truth in that statement looms over every frame like a dark cloud that permeates every moment, every sequence, every nightmarish reality.  Harmony Korine is not afraid to exploit the darkside of modern youth, and finding fragments of apathy and ignorance to lace the development of character gives both `Kids' and `Spring Breakers' a chilling sense of honesty.We hate for it to be true, but we can't deny that it is.That is what makes these films so socially important.  They are not shy of social relevance, no matter how unattractive or uncomfortable it may be.  Watching either film, especially `Kids', is not pretty.  In fact, I squirmed during some moments and found my stomach tensing as certain sequences of events were unfolding in a way that made me feel almost dirty.  Korine doesn't sugarcoat a thing.  He lays it all bare for us to decipher and dissect.With `Kids', Korine exposed the ignorance of youth in the way they viewed sex.  With innocence being wasted on a group of children thrust into life, wholly unaware of where it is going to take them, `Kids' is a brutal look at the effect that growing up too soon can have on an entire generation.  With `Spring Breakers' he exposes a more apathetic view towards life itself but showing the steady decline of morals and value of life as these young girls fall into a pattern of reckless abandon.  Together they paint a stark yet accurate picture of the very problem with society today.  Children are oppressed by the very image of immorality that corrupts the heart of pop culture and creates in them a complete disregard for life because to them they are invincible.  In `Kids', young Telly is blinded to facts by the fantasy idea that sex with virgins will keep him safe from STDs, while in `Spring Breakers' the girls fall into a video game mentality, even using that very inspiration for their behavior (""just pretend it's a video game, like you're in a movie"").Littered with provocative and lived in performances, both films thrive thanks to the dedicated performances throughout.

It's filmed in a very simple style, and the dialogue is so life-like that it feels unscripted. But it is scripted, of course, and the film is somewhat stylized. For all its alleged obscenity, it actually takes a fairly conservative stance. Casual sex is equated with AIDS, which of course is equated with death. It's a classic cautionary tale, just written and acted in a hyper-real fashion. Of course, that is what makes it so effective. This film probably did more to promote abstinence than all the sermons in the world.It's interesting to note that, for all his amorality, Telly actually has a bit of the romantic in him. His justification for seducing virgins is that they will remember him as long as they live. There's something of the decadent aesthetic in that. And, as strange as it may seem, it's touchingly naive. In fact, it's the girls, not Telly, who are the most cynical about sex. Their conversation between themselves would have dashed all of his illusions, had he been around to hear it. It is a very perceptive, if unpleasant observation on the film's part.

You can just sense that almost everything that occurs in this film despite the slightest creative license has most likely occurred in real life and the convincing acting of the teenagers who look the part (Not looking like they're 21.) really justify that. A perfect example includes a scene where teenagers mock a smaller kid because he hasn't been laid amongst other scenes.While I think it's brilliant in its depiction I just can't give it five stars because quite frankly I really wouldn't want to see this again. I understand it's not meant to give any answers and just be a voyeuristic look at a failed generation but it's so grimly realistic that it leaves the viewer bitter and disgusted with no sense that a kid can turn out being anything but a degenerate, the film gives the impression it's a tad too late.However I think EVERYONE should see this before they start a family as it'll either make you hate teens or show that we've got to clean up our act if we intend future generations to grow up with any sense of conscience and moral decency, ESPECIALLY in economically struggling and socially broken homes.

416063,A1YQ6QB2127AJ4,6304346158,David Anderson,"[2, 4]","""Kids"" is one of the most controversial releases of 1995.  Its brilliant and daring plot earns the writers tremendous respect.  The inside look of a sexually active teenager, Telly, teaches many lifelong lessons about the dangers and the consequences about such lifestyles.  All of his friends influencing him and applauding him for his actions keeps the film interesting as it helps explores other dangerous lifestyles: drug use, violence, etc.  In the meantime, they explore another storyline: that of one of Telly's ex-sex partners, Jennie, who discovers she's HIV-positive.  Telly is the only sex partner she's had.  While she's trying to find Telly to share the news to him, he chases another potential sex partner.  Such combination offers a more intense movie experience and adds more twists and turns.  Obviously, the writers never held back any graphic details.  They share the scenes with the audience like no one is acting.  The camera work and the lighting add to the danger effect.  The lights shine brighter in most of the afternoon scenes, successfully offering a more graphic view of the characters' environment and a more raw feel.  Had they not done that, the danger feel wouldn't have been as heavily present.  Leo Fitzpatrick (""Bully"")wonderfully portrayed Telly, offering his own bad boy image into the character and to the movie.  His research about the expressed issues is obviously present.  Oscar nominee Chloe Sevigny (""Boys Don't Cry"") proves in her role as Jennie that she is one of the greatest independant movie actresses ever.  As with all her projects, her every drop of heart and soul is fully expressed through her character.  All other actors also perform their roles wonderfully.  ""Kids"" is a great movie for those looking for something daring.  This is highly recommended for parents to show their kids.  Few other movies show as much realism as ""Kids"".

Maybe we will live in a futuristic, badlands world like in ""Road Warrior"". Forget global warming, maybe our youthful generation will end mankind. ""Kids"" follows the stories of Jenny & Tellie. Tellie is a teenage boy who craves sex with virgins. He craves it so much that he goes on his own personal quest to get as much virgin girls as he can. Jenny is one of Tellie's former flings and she has contracted the HIV virus from Tellie. Throughout the film we witness a gang beating (about ten guys against one), drug use, shoplifting from a store, stealing from a parent, a rape between two teenagers involving Jenny and a wild, alcohol party with kids as young as 10 drinking! The film ends as Jenny pursues Tellie to tell him about the HIV virus and possibly stop him from affecting more unsuspecting victims.This is quite a shocking film induced to shock.  It has a redeeming realism to it because chances are you may have passed by ""kids"" like this on a daily basis. We can see kids like this in a mall, bus station, school or just by walking by. Maybe you just wish some of these kids will go away and grow up, but some cannot. Let this movie be a wake up call to parents. This movie can be a parent's worst nightmare. I think this is the type of movie parents & teenagers should watch together.There is one scene that surprised me in the movie. In the subway, Tellie and his friend, Casper are talking boastfully about sex and profanity. A man with no legs enters the subway car and sings repeatedly ""I have no legs"". As he passes the two boys, they slump and stare quietly. Tellie's friend reaches for some change to give to the handicapped man.

And convince them he does, with smooth talking, lies and a lot of persuasion over the girls' clear reluctance. Sevigny's character is the most likeable as the innocent whose life comes apart at its fragile seams when she accompanies a much more promiscuous friend to a clinic to be tested. Sevigny is tested only as a favour to the friend. Her friend is HIV negative. Sevigny then wanders through the city to confront Telly, who is, as the film progresses, deflowering yet another young girl. When Sevigny finally locates him at a party in the midst of having sex with his latest conquest, she passes out and another friend rapes her while she is unconscious, having no idea what he is getting himself into. Overall this film is just... shocking and horrifying. I don't even have the adjectives to describe how affecting this film is. I wish it were not so disturbing and so nonchalant. What can be said for the film, though, is that it told the story through the eyes of the kids and did not attempt to moralise, which will allow the audience to make up their own minds.",2,SHOCKING,992131200,"06 10, 2001",2001,1789,"['way', 'purpose', 'film', 'shock', 'did', 'cavalier', 'casual', 'attitude', 'sex', 'drugs', 'shocking', 'enough', 'own', 'However', 'fact', 'kids', 'yes', 'kids', 'indulging', 'more', 'decadent', 'dangerous', 'things', 'positively', 'sickening', 'heard', 'lot', 'movie', 'years', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'recently', 'feel', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'horrified', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'teenager', 'mid-twenties', 'sheltered', 'woman', 'am', 'today', 'real', 'tragedy', 'when', 'girl', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'HIV', 'positive', 'result', 'one', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'guy', 'Telly', 'who', 'reputation', 'going', 'around', 'having', 'sex', 'girls', 'can', 'convince', 'convince', 'smooth', 'talking', 'lies', 'lot', 'persuasion', 'girls', 'clear', 'reluctance', 'Sevigny', 'character', 'most', 'likeable', 'innocent', 'life', 'apart', 'fragile', 'seams', 'when', 'much', 'more', 'promiscuous', 'friend', 'clinic', 'be', 'tested', 'Sevigny', 'tested', 'only', 'favour', 'friend', 'friend', 'HIV', 'negative', 'Sevigny', 'then', 'city', 'confront', 'Telly', 'who', 'film', 'deflowering', 'yet', 'young', 'girl', 'When', 'Sevigny', 'finally', 'party', 'midst', 'having', 'sex', 'latest', 'conquest', 'out', 'friend', 'unconscious', 'having', 'idea', 'what', 'getting', 'Overall', 'film', 'just', 'shocking', 'horrifying', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'adjectives', 'describe', 'how', 'affecting', 'film', 'wish', 'were', 'not', 'so', 'disturbing', 'so', 'nonchalant', 'What', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'told', 'story', 'eyes', 'kids', 'did', 'not', 'attempt', 'moralise', 'will', 'allow', 'audience', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'minds']",N/A
416075,A2T0XBQM7N923Y,6304346158,Fady Ghaly,"[0, 2]","Following the film's grubby and heartless introduction enough to already have an impact upon a viewer and have him think twice as to whether or not he shall continue watching it, there is a scene where Telly, walking along the streets of New York City with his alcohol-dependent friend Casper, narrates to him his latest sexual subjugation, which we have just witnessed in callous detail. Casper is gulping beer from a bottle, which he has likely stolen from a convenience store, for you later see him stealing a fresh one out of the fridge, ever so casually mind you. Telly's language is like strings of hideous blows; he articulates about his exuberance for ""de-virginizing"" young girls, Casper cheers him on, and it becomes clear that neither one of them has any state of curiosity, any esteem, frame of consultation, beyond instantaneous animal regalement.Then a peculiar thing occurs. Casper respites casually, in plain view of a passerby on a street corner, to urinate. That is not what is odd. What is odd is that Telly opts to stand around the corner from his friend, to grant him privacy. If you scrutinize this body language, you comprehend that these kids live entirely in a world of their own. Other people-adults-simply do not exist, which is a reason large enough to baffle many as to the lactation this film was made in, for the camera, like the characters, sees merely this deplorable youth culture. Director Larry Clark's Kids is a film regarding their world, seeing everything as they see it, being the reason you scarcely get to see Manhattan. It is twenty-four-excessively-agitated-hours in the lives of these youths through one simmering summer day and night during which they travel Manhattan on skateboards and subway trains, shoplift, drink, use drugs, chat about and have sex, party like there's no tomorrow, involve themselves into fights so aggressive they're pestilent, and crash in an accustomed stupor, before beginning all over again the following day. It's clear to us that most of these kids are likely to not make it out alive past a period of their age when others would be worrying about their future careers, if they were to not already be locked behind bars, and it isn't like they have a future to look up for, anyway, nor does anything else interest them in life than doing all of the mutinous things you see them doing in this film. Telly, on the other hand, at least has an interest (or more of a hobby): Sex. His face is a frightening contemplation in self-absorption as he tells girls lies they should laugh at. Being thickheaded, nave, or simply inquisitive, they listen to him, not aware of the consequences that come with such decisions, of Telly's true personality that is always revealed following the acting out upon his sexual fulfillment, which is not at all the compassionate and caring one it's made out to be. Aside from his looks, which weren't much to look at, yet I guess he's quite successful in compelling the curious, his voice was so very rustic and abrasive; everything he says sounds deleterious.The film sees this culture in such flat, unblinking detail, with dialogue so authentic in the world of today (for it was written by a nineteen-year-old whose life was once familiar to theirs), that you will develop the sensation that you were watching a documentary! With breathtaking images from one of the world's most renowned photographers, Kids is an affecting, no-holds-back landscape of words and language, protracting with raw sincerity and experiences, attitudes and perplexities of innocence lost.Kids, as critics have called it, is a wake-up call to the world.

It isn't a pretty film nor is it easy to stomach, in fact, most people I've known did not like it at all.  My mother called it garbage and kiddie porn and all kinds of foul names.  She didn't really get the idea of how this is the way quite a few of our young people live their lives.  I think that is why alot of folks hate this film.  Then you have the other side who see it for what it really is - the truth.  Not all teens or kids behave this way but I think parents would be appalled to find out just how many do these things.Kids start drinking too young, they start having sex too young and they don't think of the consequences.  This film does not in any way glorify teen sex at all.  In fact, it tells a story that no teen movies ever tell and that is that AIDS exists and no one is immune regardless of age or how many sexual partners they have.  Kids is the only film that really tells a story the mainstream moviegoers find too depressing.  Larry Clark has the guts to remind all of us of what's out there.

It's like a gifted filmmaker took a camera out on the streets and just let it roll, capturing  every facet of teenagers gone wild and off the deep end of delinquency.  Nothing is masked by censorship, but is here in its entirety with every  brutal and horrific image ever imagined played out here mercilessly. The  story focuses on Telly, who has this overwhelmingingly insatiable hunger  for making girls lose their virginity. But he may have gone too far. One  girl, Jennie, who had a wild time with him, has been infected with the AIDS  virus and must scour the city of New York to find Telly and warn him of the  pending danger that will one day claim him as well. But her search is in  vain, mixed with the horror of the inevitable that she will die at an early  age thanks to him. Telly is off with his buddies living it up, and the  night Jennie finds him, she makes the horrific discovery that she may be  too late. This film is definitely not for the faint hearted or the saints.  On a level or morale it looks nasty and hideous to the art of filmmaking,  but when looked at from the perspective of movies as an art form, it is a  genuine masterpiece of seizing real images in life on film and playing it  out before the eyes of those who refuse to admit that the youth of our  country is going in the wrong direction in life.

It shows a lot of kids smoking, sleeping around, drinking, sleeping around some more, talking about sex, doing drugs, etc., etc..  Most critics were in deep, deep shock that the children of American would actually indulge in this type of behaviour.  I wasn't.  Teenagers do incredibly stupid things (mostly revolving around drugs) and seem to enjoy wasting time (all in the name of so-called rebellion).  This kind of stuff has been happening since time began, and while it may be more explicit nowadays, it's still not that shocking.  Perhaps critics think of America as the TV shows they saw in the 1950's or something like that, some lame, completely unrealistic Norman Rockwell, My Three Sons type of America, which doesn't exist and has never existed.  I don't really know.  As for the film, I would have preferred Harmony Korine (the screenwriter of this film) to direct it.  He has a much better sense of art and cinema than Larry Clark does.  Larry Clark's directorial style (if you can call it that) is way too straightforward and really lacks in imagination.  The only scene that I found haunting was the final one, when an aria is heard (or an operatic song), and we see some beautiful camera work.  It's the only moment of poetry in the film, and it wouldn't have surprised me if Korine directed it himself, as there are similar scenes in Korine's underrated julien donkey-boy.  Clark and Korine would revisit this subject with the infamous, rarely screened Ken Park, and that film is supposed to be worse than this one.  If you check Kids out once, that's enough.

416090,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,6304346158,Jason,"[3, 6]","More troubling than Kathy Bates' nude scene, Kids is a raw, voyeuristic look at the ever-decreasing morality of teenagers, sinking lower with each successive generation of degenerates.  Like a sucker punch to the stomach, this film shocks the senses and leaves a nauseating aftertaste, like the acid reflux of disgust.Following the daily meandering of delinquents, cotton-mouthed Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and soullessly bankrupt Casper (Justin Pierce), an inside look at every parent's nightmare is provided.  Between massive sessions of drug and alcohol abuse, the two manage to squeeze in time for a savage beating at a skate park, breaking and entering, and non-stop parties.  The shock of this movie, however, is obviously its brazen look at teen sexuality, as Telly and Casper talk ad nauseum about their desire for virginal conquests, regardless of the ever-increasing danger of AIDS.  It takes the life-changing tragedy for Jennie (Chloe Sevigny) - one of Telly's former sexual partners - to expose the truly despicable nature of Telly and Casper's actions.  Welcome to the urban edition of Lord of the Flies.The acting and teen life is jaw-droppingly realistic and accurate.  Every day, teens seemingly get worse and worse, and Kids amps it up quite a bit.  The sugar and spice of yesteryear is gone; the fly on the wall ate it, and puked.  I'm still sickened at not only the actions of Telly, but also by the thought that such a goofy, ugly, mush-mouthed kid could accomplish what he so easily does (which I'm positive happens in reality).  It's not just the morals declining; standards are dropping at an alarming rate.The best aspect of this eye-opening piece is the introduction of two young stars: Sevigny and Rosario Dawson.

416092,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,6304346158,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[10, 11]","First time viewing this film and it brought back some memory's of my adolescent years during that time frame. I was around the same age as them (between 15 and 16 years old) living in NYC. Despite the cast having no previous acting experience, the performances are all wonderful, especially Justin Pierce's (as Casper).The realistic story line, the classic dialogue, and the horrific finale are the film's best features. There isn't a whole lot to the story, other than it chronicles an eventful day in the life of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick), his friend Casper (Justin Pierce) and their inner-circle of similar-minded, sex/drug-crazed associates. Telly has made it a duty to ""deflower"" as many girls as possible and later brag to his friends about his latest conquest; but by day's end, guaranteed, he would've done it again (a record for him to do two girls in one day). The main conflict of the story surfaces about 30 minutes in, when Jennie (Chloe Sevigny) discovers that she had contracted HIV from Telly during their first sexual encounter and it becomes her mission to track him down before another young girl shares her fate.These are the kids of yesteryear, the forgotten generation; these kids are America's worst nightmare because they are young, dumb and just do not care; the fact that they do not care makes them especially dangerous. The imagery is extreme and frightening. If there ever was an honest thing these kids ever did, it would have to be willfully giving change to the less fortunate (a man with no legs who rides a skateboard on the subway). We also get images of younger children, swearing, drinking, smoking, talking like adults; trying to fit in with their peers who are not much older than they are. I was actually quite frightened by some baby pictures of our main character and then I see what's on screen.Leo Fitzpatrick puts a face on a sleeping monster in America: the doomed generation of young people that disregard older generations completely and follow their own set of corrupted values. Telly is reckless and stupid; it is impossible to really sympathize with his character, even though we probably are. But it is difficult to do so, mainly because of his preference for deflowering girls younger than him (the first girl we see him with is only 12; he's about 15 or 16) and that could open up discussion for Telly possibly being a borderline pedophile.I kept saying to myself ""Where are the parents?"" One could very easily ask that question. Strangely enough, Telly lives with his mother and baby brother. She is the only parent in the film and she seems as every bit as irresponsible as her misguided son.Watching ""Kids,"" I couldn't believe how real it is, how it sucks the viewer into its dark, dangerous, and seductive world; it's easy to see how a weak person could believe that what goes on in this movie is cool. It begs the most fundamental question any responsible person could ever ask, ""Do you know where your children are?""It is a question that every good parent should ask when their teenage son or daughter steps out that front door and into the ""real"" world.

It sounded just a tad depressing (how wrong was I????) to watch on Christmas Day, so I decided to watch it the next night.What's ultimately shocking about Kids is how realistic it is. How many times have you seen a group of kids walking towards you, and crossed the road to avoid them? How many times have you seen a couple openly snogging at a bus stop and stopped to think, ""They're too young?"" How many times have you read in the press about the latest 12 year old getting pregnant, cos her boyfriend told her he loved her? Or am I just getting old? It could also be because I never experienced that when I was young. I was still playing with Barbies when the kids in this were out getting drunk and doing god knows what. What's also realistic is the language. I actually went to put the subtitles on whilst watching this, cos I couldn't understand a word the kids were saying. (I'm only 22!) And as it turned, there weren't any subtitles to understand Telly or Casper, so I had to gather as much as possible.Telly is the main character; with a face only a mother could love, and has a thing for deflowering virgins. He also has HIV. But does he know? Personally, I didn't find the actor playing him that attractive, and he got girls into bed, by telling them that he ""liked"" them. At least they didn't fall for the ""I love you, now come to bed"" line. There are some attractive scenes of Telly at it in bed, with the unlucky girl. His best friend, Casper, doesn't seem to get the girls as much, at least, until the end.Jennie and her friend, played by a really young Rosario Dawson, go to a clinic to get tested. No pregnancy tests are ever mentioned, but an HIV test is. And Jennie has it. The only guy she's ever slept with? Telly.Jennie decides to catch up with him, to confront him, to do god knows what, but fatally, only just catches up with him when he's already found himself another virgin. She also gets caught up the whole nonsense, when she passes out drunk, and Casper, hungover (or still drunk) and horny, decides he needs a piece of her.This should really be shown to any irresponsible parents out there. The ones who don't care about their kids, and care about their job/toyboy/favourite child etc. The parents who give their kids too much pocket money, which will ultimately be spent on cigarettes & booze, rather than a decent lunch.It's probably not a good idea to watch this film if you're easily affected by this kind of thing. I couldn't forget about it, and a day later, am still thinking about poor Jennie, and ultimately, Casper too. The kids are set on self-destruction, and this movie shows how. Afterwards, I felt like I needed a cuddle, just some general love & affection. It's a really hard movie to watch and also a hard movie to forget about. It will probably haunt the viewer for the rest of their life, if they've got a haunt. The film needs to be taken seriously. Pick it up if you see it for a lesson in life, and how NOT to bring your children up.",3,They're bringing up the next generation?!,1167177600,"12 27, 2006",2006,3159,"['did', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'weird', 'give', 'Christmas', 'present', 'watching', 'considering', ""'d"", 'never', 'heard', 'when', 'opened', 'was', 'just', 'bit', 'curious', 'sounded', 'just', 'tad', 'depressing', 'how', 'wrong', 'was', 'watch', 'Christmas', 'Day', 'decided', 'watch', 'next', 'night.What', 'ultimately', 'shocking', 'Kids', 'how', 'realistic', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'group', 'kids', 'walking', 'towards', 'crossed', 'road', 'avoid', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'couple', 'openly', 'snogging', 'bus', 'stop', 'stopped', 'think', ""'re"", 'too', 'young', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'have', 'read', 'press', 'latest', '12', 'year', 'old', 'getting', 'pregnant', 'cos', 'boyfriend', 'told', 'loved', 'am', 'just', 'getting', 'old', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'never', 'experienced', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'still', 'playing', 'Barbies', 'when', 'kids', 'were', 'out', 'getting', 'drunk', 'doing', 'god', 'what', 'What', 'also', 'realistic', 'language', 'actually', 'went', 'put', 'subtitles', 'whilst', 'watching', 'cos', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'kids', 'were', 'saying', ""'m"", 'only', '22', 'turned', 'were', ""n't"", 'subtitles', 'understand', 'Telly', 'Casper', 'had', 'gather', 'as', 'much', 'possible.Telly', 'main', 'character', 'face', 'only', 'mother', 'could', 'love', 'thing', 'deflowering', 'virgins', 'also', 'HIV', 'know', 'Personally', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'actor', 'playing', 'attractive', 'got', 'girls', 'bed', 'telling', 'liked', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'love', 'now', 'come', 'bed', 'line', 'are', 'attractive', 'scenes', 'Telly', 'bed', 'unlucky', 'girl', 'best', 'friend', 'Casper', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'girls', 'much', 'least', 'end.Jennie', 'friend', 'played', 'really', 'young', 'Rosario', 'Dawson', 'go', 'clinic', 'get', 'tested', 'pregnancy', 'tests', 'are', 'ever', 'mentioned', 'HIV', 'test', 'Jennie', 'only', 'guy', 'ever', 'slept', 'Telly.Jennie', 'catch', 'up', 'confront', 'do', 'god', 'knows', 'what', 'fatally', 'only', 'just', 'up', 'when', 'already', 'found', 'virgin', 'also', 'caught', 'up', 'whole', 'nonsense', 'when', 'out', 'drunk', 'Casper', 'hungover', 'still', 'drunk', 'horny', 'piece', 'her.This', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'shown', 'irresponsible', 'parents', 'there', 'ones', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'kids', 'care', 'job/toyboy/favourite', 'child', 'etc', 'parents', 'who', 'give', 'kids', 'too', 'much', 'pocket', 'money', 'will', 'ultimately', 'be', 'spent', 'cigarettes', 'booze', 'rather', 'decent', 'lunch.It', 'probably', 'not', 'good', 'idea', 'watch', 'film', ""'re"", 'easily', 'affected', 'kind', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'forget', 'day', 'later', 'am', 'still', 'thinking', 'poor', 'Jennie', 'ultimately', 'Casper', 'too', 'kids', 'are', 'set', 'self-destruction', 'movie', 'how', 'Afterwards', 'felt', 'needed', 'cuddle', 'just', 'general', 'love', 'affection', 'really', 'hard', 'movie', 'watch', 'also', 'hard', 'movie', 'forget', 'about', 'will', 'probably', 'haunt', 'viewer', 'rest', 'life', ""'ve"", 'got', 'haunt', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'Pick', 'up', 'see', 'lesson', 'life', 'how', 'NOT', 'bring', 'children', 'up']",N/A

416117,A27PSZX2SE0B51,6304346158,Mike Stone,"[9, 12]","I think this is the only time I was fooled.  Many films attempt to achieve a documentary feel within a fictional narrative.  Usually, they fail miserably.  ""Kids"", however, got me hook, line, and sinker.  I was amazed that director Larry Clark had managed to get seemingly unlimited access and unsparing raw footage of teenagers patrolling the streets of Manhattan.  I only found out later that the whole thing was an expertly made fiction (although there are some clues; I should have wondered how Clark got the p.o.v. shot of the kid getting beaten in the park).The credit, I suspect, should be doled out in three equal portions.First, Clark himself.  His cinema verite camera work is terribly effective.  Some scenes consist only of him setting the camera up in the middle of the room, and swinging around from face to face to catch bits and pieces of conversation.  An early sequence, shot in this way, contrasts what boys talk about (uh, sex and drugs apparently) with what girls talk about (more or less the same thing), in a way that never feels scripted or rehearsed, but also doesn't come across as amateurish or slapdash.  The casualness of the direction allows for the casual story to unfold.  It also allows those moments of high drama to stand out even more.  Witness the aforementioned scene in the park, where dozens of young skaters beat up one unsuspecting tough guy.  It's gruesome and brutal stuff, but Clark's camera never flinches.  (Later, someone offhandedly asks, ""Do you think we killed that guy?"", a question that's quickly brushed aside without a second thought, perfectly detailing the inherent nihilism that makes these characters so fascinating to watch.)Second share of the credit goes to the actors.  A quick perusal through their filmmographies reveals no one had much more than amateur experience beforehand, and really only Chloe Sevigny has made any waves since.  But in the context of ""Kids"", they're all wonderful.  Leo Fitzpatrick, in what could have been a very unlikable role as Telly, is terribly charming when he needs to be, in a seedy kind of way.  His buddy Casper, a near-brain-dead space cadet with a mean streak, is perfectly essayed by Justin Pierce.  And Sevigny herself takes a wonderfully rigid, and then totally freaked-out turn as Jennie.  These are the three biggest roles.  But peopling the backgrounds are a vast menagerie of unknown actors and real-life street kids, none of whom ever strikes a wrong or false note.  Most striking is a group of boys who Clark focuses on for one long moment at a party: they're shirtless, stuffed four wide into a couch, and sharing a joint.  They are obviously much younger than the main circle of kids we've been following (presumably someone's younger brothers), and their brief appearance lets you realize that the people you are watching aren't just an isolated incident; they are a trend that will be followed for generations to come.The third and final credit share goes to Harmony Korine.  Korine, an apparent child prodigy, was only 19 when he wrote ""Kids"".  It thus doesn't surprise me nearly as much as it should that he got the lingo and slang of teenagers just right.  The dialogue feels genuine and authentic.  The screenplay's greatest strength, though, is that it is fairly tight structurally, but the audience never feels like a story is being told.  It may seem at first like a mosaic of a movie, randomly put together around themes and not much else.  But closer inspection reveals a very strong, if hidden, narrative. Jennie finds out some bad news that she must tell to Telly.  She spends the rest of the movie searching for him, but is always one or two steps behind him.  Telly, for his part, is searching for something of his own: a new virgin to deflower (his randy/amoral little hobby).  The narrative stretches out over the course of one, hot Manhattan day, and even though there is no real deadline, Korine (along with Clark's direction) makes it feel like Jennie must catch Telly before the sun goes down.  In doing so, he/they give the film a thrust that an ordinary documentary-style would never be able to achieve.  And still, what could have come across as a ham-handed suspense thriller is, as written, more like a visceral slice of life.And for those who think this film offers only a glimpse into the kids' world, and not a moral lesson, I ask you this:  What do you think will happen to Telly, Jennie, and Casper in the year after the movie ends?  I imagine their carefree days will be over soon, and the consequences of their actions will be felt full force.  It's quite a powerful film, if you think of it that way.  And even if you don't, it still moves you.",5,Further proof that youth is wasted on the young,1018656000,"04 13, 2002",2002,4690,"['think', 'only', 'time', 'was', 'fooled', 'Many', 'films', 'attempt', 'achieve', 'documentary', 'feel', 'fictional', 'narrative', 'Usually', 'fail', 'miserably', 'Kids', 'however', 'got', 'hook', 'line', 'sinker', 'was', 'amazed', 'director', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'had', 'managed', 'get', 'seemingly', 'unlimited', 'access', 'unsparing', 'raw', 'footage', 'teenagers', 'patrolling', 'streets', 'Manhattan', 'only', 'found', 'out', 'later', 'whole', 'thing', 'was', 'expertly', 'made', 'fiction', 'are', 'clues', 'should', 'have', 'wondered', 'how', 'Clark', 'got', 'p.o.v', 'shot', 'kid', 'getting', 'beaten', 'park', '.The', 'credit', 'suspect', 'should', 'be', 'doled', 'out', 'three', 'equal', 'portions.First', 'Clark', 'cinema', 'verite', 'camera', 'work', 'terribly', 'effective', 'scenes', 'consist', 'only', 'setting', 'camera', 'up', 'middle', 'room', 'swinging', 'around', 'face', 'face', 'catch', 'bits', 'pieces', 'conversation', 'early', 'sequence', 'shot', 'way', 'what', 'talk', 'uh', 'sex', 'drugs', 'apparently', 'what', 'girls', 'talk', 'more', 'less', 'same', 'thing', 'way', 'never', 'feels', 'scripted', 'rehearsed', 'also', ""n't"", 'come', 'amateurish', 'slapdash', 'casualness', 'direction', 'casual', 'story', 'unfold', 'also', 'moments', 'high', 'drama', 'stand', 'out', 'even', 'more', 'aforementioned', 'scene', 'park', 'where', 'dozens', 'young', 'skaters', 'beat', 'up', 'one', 'unsuspecting', 'tough', 'guy', 'gruesome', 'brutal', 'stuff', 'Clark', 'camera', 'never', 'flinches', 'Later', 'someone', 'offhandedly', 'Do', 'think', 'killed', 'guy', 'question', 'quickly', 'brushed', 'aside', 'second', 'thought', 'perfectly', 'detailing', 'inherent', 'nihilism', 'characters', 'so', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Second', 'share', 'credit', 'actors', 'quick', 'perusal', 'filmmographies', 'one', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'amateur', 'experience', 'beforehand', 'really', 'only', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'made', 'waves', 'context', 'Kids', ""'re"", 'wonderful', 'Leo', 'Fitzpatrick', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'unlikable', 'role', 'Telly', 'terribly', 'charming', 'when', 'be', 'seedy', 'kind', 'way', 'buddy', 'Casper', 'near-brain-dead', 'space', 'cadet', 'mean', 'streak', 'perfectly', 'essayed', 'Justin', 'Pierce', 'Sevigny', 'wonderfully', 'rigid', 'then', 'totally', 'freaked-out', 'turn', 'Jennie', 'are', 'three', 'biggest', 'roles', 'peopling', 'backgrounds', 'are', 'vast', 'menagerie', 'unknown', 'actors', 'real-life', 'street', 'kids', 'none', 'whom', 'ever', 'wrong', 'false', 'note', 'Most', 'striking', 'group', 'boys', 'who', 'Clark', 'one', 'long', 'moment', 'party', ""'re"", 'shirtless', 'stuffed', 'four', 'wide', 'couch', 'sharing', 'joint', 'are', 'obviously', 'much', 'younger', 'main', 'circle', 'kids', ""'ve"", 'been', 'following', 'presumably', 'someone', 'younger', 'brothers', 'brief', 'appearance', 'lets', 'realize', 'people', 'are', 'watching', 'are', ""n't"", 'just', 'isolated', 'incident', 'are', 'trend', 'will', 'be', 'followed', 'generations', 'come.The', 'third', 'final', 'credit', 'share', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'Korine', 'apparent', 'child', 'prodigy', 'was', 'only', '19', 'when', 'wrote', 'Kids', 'thus', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'should', 'got', 'lingo', 'slang', 'teenagers', 'just', 'right', 'dialogue', 'feels', 'genuine', 'authentic', 'screenplay', 'greatest', 'strength', 'fairly', 'tight', 'structurally', 'audience', 'never', 'story', 'being', 'told', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'mosaic', 'movie', 'randomly', 'put', 'together', 'themes', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'closer', 'inspection', 'very', 'strong', 'hidden', 'narrative', 'Jennie', 'out', 'bad', 'news', 'must', 'tell', 'Telly', 'rest', 'movie', 'searching', 'always', 'one', 'two', 'steps', 'Telly', 'part', 'searching', 'something', 'own', 'new', 'virgin', 'deflower', 'randy/amoral', 'little', 'hobby', 'narrative', 'stretches', 'out', 'course', 'one', 'hot', 'Manhattan', 'day', 'even', 'real', 'deadline', 'Korine', 'Clark', 'direction', 'feel', 'Jennie', 'must', 'catch', 'Telly', 'sun', 'down', 'doing', 'so', 'give', 'film', 'thrust', 'ordinary', 'documentary-style', 'would', 'never', 'be', 'able', 'achieve', 'still', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'ham-handed', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'written', 'more', 'visceral', 'slice', 'life.And', 'who', 'think', 'film', 'only', 'glimpse', 'kids', 'world', 'not', 'moral', 'lesson', 'ask', 'What', 'do', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'Telly', 'Jennie', 'Casper', 'year', 'movie', 'imagine', 'carefree', 'days', 'will', 'be', 'soon', 'consequences', 'actions', 'will', 'be', 'felt', 'full', 'force', 'quite', 'powerful', 'film', 'think', 'way', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'still']",N/A

The main character named Telly (the ""virgin surgeon"") even reminded me of Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE in so many ways.KIDS came out at a time when the HIV virus was much more common among kids than it is today.

Also, the kids do drugs...lots of drugs. Yet again, completely shocked by the rawness and reality of the picture.

The youths that inhabit this film are not just wayward... they are violent, amoral kids whose state of evolution seems to have regressed to something more primal.  The male lead, if you can call him that, in this movie is a truly horrific animal named Telly (played with scary realism by actor Leo Fitzpatrick).  Telly seems to exist for no other reason than drink, get high, get into fights, and, oh yeah, deflower as many virgins as possible.  He cajoles his conquests by telling them exactly what they want to hear, and once he's accomplished his mission, he will have nothing to do with them.  He says he prefers them because they aren't all dirty or have diseases.  Yet, the irony is, he is unknowingly carrying the AIDS virus around and endangering his conquests because it would seem that one of his 'virgins' was not quite honest with him.  It's not hard to see how Telly can become such a monster.  He has no moral compass around which to develop.  One brief scene takes place during a brief stopover at his house before he and his friend, Casper, take off for more mayhem.  His mother is sitting in the living room, folding laundry and watching TV while being almost totally oblivious to Telly being there.  When Telly asks for some money, she says no and asks him when he's going to get a job, he just says that he's looking and then he goes into her room and takes some money, anyway.  She wouldn't know if it was missing.The actual plot of this movie, as thin as it is, focuses on a girl named Jennie (who was one of Telly's conquests) searching the streets of the city to find Telly and stop his virgin conquest because of the AIDS virus she just found out he gave her.  Her search is intercut with scenes of a brutal gang beating by Telly and his friends of guy who popped off his mouth, club kids engaging in animalistic carnal behavior, and a morally bankrupt party where kids as young as 10 are drinking up, getting high and participating in even more carnal behavior.""Kids"" gets a positive rating because there is nothing phony about its unflinching view of the existence of kids with too much time on their hands and no direction in their lives.

AIDS, considered a modern day plague and one very avoidable for those who were not the unfortunate victim of a medical ""accident"", has no apparent meaning for Telly and Caspar, one not exactly college material, and the other his amoral and willing prodigy.The location photography is in the best tradition of hard, gritty films of the early '70s, like ""Mean Steets"" (DeNiro, Keitel) and ""Born To Win"" (George Segal and Karen Black; Robert DeNiro in a small supporting role).The scene at the clinic when Jennie learns she is HIV-positive is riveting to say the least. The Medical staffer tells it like it is to Jennie, who acknowledges the seriousness of her condition, but can't seem to manage her new responsibility in notifying Telly, or in making an abrupt change in her life style. She finds herself at another wild party and in no condition to block the advances of Caspar.The film took a bold step in focusing on heterosexual transmission at a time when the bisexual or homosexual community was unjustly identified as solely responsible for the spread of this disease. The problem with using this movie as a teaching tool, however, is that Jennie is the only sympathetic character, among the ""older"" kids, who should know something about the risks of certain behaviours.Very strong performances, and subtle direction should have made this effort a cult classic, presuming it doesn't have that status.",4,Documentary-style drama,1196121600,"11 27, 2007",2007,1624,"['minor', 'classic', 'flawed', 'inability', 'really', 'provide', 'clues', 'why', 'stereotypically', 'lost', 'urban', 'youth', 'today', 'seem', 'willing', 'take', 'chances', 'even', 'worst', 'previous', 'generations', 'would', ""n't"", 'consider', 'AIDS', 'considered', 'modern', 'day', 'plague', 'one', 'very', 'avoidable', 'who', 'were', 'not', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'medical', 'accident', 'apparent', 'meaning', 'Telly', 'Caspar', 'one', 'not', 'exactly', 'college', 'material', 'other', 'amoral', 'willing', 'prodigy.The', 'location', 'photography', 'best', 'tradition', 'hard', 'gritty', 'films', 'early', ""'70s"", 'Mean', 'Steets', 'DeNiro', 'Keitel', 'Born', 'Win', 'George', 'Segal', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Robert', 'DeNiro', 'small', 'supporting', 'role', '.The', 'scene', 'clinic', 'when', 'Jennie', 'HIV-positive', 'riveting', 'say', 'least', 'Medical', 'staffer', 'Jennie', 'who', 'seriousness', 'condition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'manage', 'new', 'responsibility', 'notifying', 'Telly', 'making', 'abrupt', 'change', 'life', 'style', 'wild', 'party', 'condition', 'block', 'advances', 'Caspar.The', 'film', 'took', 'bold', 'step', 'focusing', 'heterosexual', 'transmission', 'time', 'when', 'bisexual', 'homosexual', 'community', 'was', 'unjustly', 'identified', 'solely', 'responsible', 'spread', 'disease', 'problem', 'using', 'movie', 'teaching', 'tool', 'however', 'Jennie', 'only', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'older', 'kids', 'who', 'should', 'know', 'something', 'risks', 'certain', 'behaviours.Very', 'strong', 'performances', 'subtle', 'direction', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'effort', 'cult', 'classic', 'presuming', ""n't"", 'have', 'status']",N/A

416129,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,6304346158,Richard Ross,"[2, 2]","Even though 'KIDS' wasn't as graphic as I feared it's still extremely disturbing and hard to watch. I think that's to be expected of any film that begins with a rape and ends in a double rape. Even with all of its disgusting situations, the film has a lot going for it. It serves as a cautionary tale about the life- threatening dangers of having unprotected sex. Plus, it features the film debuts of Leo Fitzpatrick, Chloe Sevigny and Rosario Dawson.Taking place over the course of a hot summer day in New York, the film focuses on two groups of teens. In the first group is Telly (Fitzpatrick) and best friend Casper (Justin Pearce). In the second group is Jenny (Sevigny) and her best friend Ruby (Dawson). Telly is the self-proclaimed ""virgin surgeon"" who delights in sharing the very graphic details of his conquests with Casper. The language in this film isn't just vulgar it's downright disgusting and in terrible taste. At one point, Casper jokes about his cousin having rough sex with a handicapped girl. Telly's goal is to de-virginize as many girls as he can. On this particular day his goal is to have sex with two virgins in the same day. Telly even has a victim picked out - the younger sister of one of his and Casper's friends. While Telly and Casper stalk the streets stealing, drinking, fighting and getting high, on the other side of town Jenny, one of Telly's previous conquests, accompanies Ruby to a clinic where both girls get tested for STDs. While Jenny has only been with Telly, Ruby has had unprotected sex with at least 9 guys. This makes things all the more shocking when Jenny tests positive for HIV while Ruby passes with a clean bill of health. A distraught and devastated Jenny sets out on all day and all night quest to find Telly and tell him before he passes on the virus to some other unsuspecting girl.The film is shocking in its depictions of kids as young as 12 smoking, drinking, taking hits off pipes and having unprotected sex. There is a scene in a skate park where Telly, Casper and a large group of their friends, after scoring some grass, beat the hell out of a black man who yelled something at Casper. The  movie is full of these kinds of disturbing moments during which director Larry Clark lets his camera linger for unbearable lengths of time. 'KIDS' crosses the  line constantly and is often too much to handle, but it's admittedly well made and well acted. When the film was released in 1995 it may have been ""a wake up call"" as many critics claimed but over the years, with the increasing popularity of reality TV and other films focusing on teens, 'KIDS' feels somewhat tame. There aren't any new revelations when it comes to teens, who don't hold back,  experimenting with sex and drugs. Instead the film shows the timeless dangers of kids, often with low self-esteem, being extremely vulnerable to peer pressure and how deadly the consequences can be if they succumb to it. It's a well made film that, no matter how disturbing, is worth seeing at least once in your life.",3,Not As Bad As I Expected,1234137600,"02 9, 2009",2009,3029,"['Even', ""'KIDS"", 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'graphic', 'feared', 'still', 'extremely', 'disturbing', 'hard', 'watch', 'think', 'be', 'expected', 'film', 'rape', 'double', 'rape', 'Even', 'disgusting', 'situations', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'life-', 'threatening', 'dangers', 'having', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'film', 'debuts', 'Leo', 'Fitzpatrick', 'Chloe', 'Sevigny', 'Rosario', 'Dawson.Taking', 'place', 'course', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'two', 'groups', 'teens', 'first', 'group', 'Telly', 'Fitzpatrick', 'best', 'friend', 'Casper', 'Justin', 'Pearce', 'second', 'group', 'Jenny', 'Sevigny', 'best', 'friend', 'Ruby', 'Dawson', 'Telly', 'self-proclaimed', 'virgin', 'surgeon', 'who', 'delights', 'sharing', 'very', 'graphic', 'details', 'conquests', 'Casper', 'language', 'film', ""n't"", 'just', 'vulgar', 'downright', 'disgusting', 'terrible', 'taste', 'one', 'point', 'Casper', 'cousin', 'having', 'rough', 'sex', 'handicapped', 'girl', 'Telly', 'goal', 'de-virginize', 'many', 'girls', 'can', 'particular', 'day', 'goal', 'have', 'sex', 'two', 'virgins', 'same', 'day', 'Telly', 'even', 'victim', 'picked', 'out', 'younger', 'sister', 'one', 'Casper', 'friends', 'Telly', 'Casper', 'stalk', 'streets', 'stealing', 'drinking', 'fighting', 'getting', 'high', 'other', 'side', 'town', 'Jenny', 'one', 'Telly', 'previous', 'conquests', 'accompanies', 'Ruby', 'clinic', 'where', 'girls', 'get', 'tested', 'STDs', 'Jenny', 'only', 'been', 'Telly', 'Ruby', 'had', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'least', '9', 'guys', 'things', 'more', 'shocking', 'when', 'Jenny', 'positive', 'HIV', 'Ruby', 'clean', 'bill', 'health', 'distraught', 'devastated', 'Jenny', 'sets', 'out', 'day', 'night', 'quest', 'find', 'Telly', 'tell', 'virus', 'other', 'unsuspecting', 'girl.The', 'film', 'shocking', 'depictions', 'kids', 'as', 'young', '12', 'smoking', 'drinking', 'taking', 'hits', 'pipes', 'having', 'unprotected', 'sex', 'scene', 'skate', 'park', 'where', 'Telly', 'Casper', 'large', 'group', 'friends', 'scoring', 'grass', 'beat', 'hell', 'black', 'man', 'who', 'yelled', 'something', 'Casper', 'movie', 'full', 'kinds', 'disturbing', 'moments', 'director', 'Larry', 'Clark', 'camera', 'linger', 'unbearable', 'lengths', 'time', 'line', 'constantly', 'often', 'too', 'much', 'handle', 'admittedly', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'When', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1995', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'many', 'critics', 'claimed', 'years', 'increasing', 'popularity', 'reality', 'TV', 'other', 'films', 'focusing', 'teens', 'feels', 'somewhat', 'tame', 'are', ""n't"", 'new', 'revelations', 'when', 'teens', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'experimenting', 'sex', 'drugs', 'Instead', 'film', 'timeless', 'dangers', 'kids', 'often', 'low', 'self-esteem', 'being', 'extremely', 'vulnerable', 'peer', 'pressure', 'how', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'can', 'be', 'succumb', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'disturbing', 'worth', 'seeing', 'least', 'once', 'life']",N/A

Of course, it's been twelve years, and the furor hasn't yet died down. I'm a little confused as to why.The story, though it takes Clark a while to get around to it: Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) and Casper (Justin Pierce) are skate kids in New York. Jennie (Sevigny) is a girl Telly had had sex with in the past. She accompanies her friend Ruby (Dawson) to the clinic so Ruby can get an HIV test; Ruby turns out negative, but Jennie is positive. The rest of the movie is Jennie trying to track down Telly before he can sleep with anyone else and tell him.First off: watch the movie with subtitles on. It won't offer a complete translation, but it'll probably help. Telly and Casper's dialogue is often unintelligible. It may lend credibility to the characters, but sometimes you have to sacrifice a bit of credibility so as not to lose your audience. (Interestingly, almost every male in the movie talks in the same odd patois; I can't remember a single female in the movie doing so.) Second, the pace here is all over the map; it seemed as if Clark were working entirely without an idea of pace until the main story starts up (which happens far enough into the film that it seems as if it's going to be a plotless slice-of-life flick for a while), and once the main story does appear, the movie wanders off into tangents that sabotage the pace even more. Parts of the film that should have been minor scenes to advance the plot are dragged out, while valuable character-building scenes are jump-cut.I got the feeling I was supposed to be shocked by the ages of the participants, as well. First off, that's a gimmick at best, and a transparent one; second, are there really people who don't know what teenagers are like these days? (And ""these days"" is a misnomer-- it's been a long, long time since I was a teen, and we were like this then, too.)It's not bad, and does contain some good performances, but it's certainly not the groundbreaking masterpiece I'd been expecting given the twelve years of raves I'd heard about it. ** ",3,Eh.

Of course, there but for the grace of God go we all, but we listen to our kids, they enjoy achieving, and they are developing interests that possibly are pointing in career directions; they rebel, they experiment, and we talk with them.So I don't think the sick kids here reflect much about the youth of today, except for a very small group.

This is not an exaggeration or a class statement; these are real kids in real neighborhoods strolling the streets with no moral direction.It really was almost like watching a documentary on a primate species, how the males and females gather in separate groups to chirp and chatter at each other until it's mating season.  Then they all get together in a big pile and have at it with whoever is handiest.The plot?  A day in the life of aimless kids: virgin conquests, shoplifting, public urinating, drinking, smoking, getting high, breaking into a pool for a skinny dip, street fighting (complete with a brutal, perhaps deadly beating for a simple transgression), raves, public fornication, and one girl's discovery that she has AIDS.There are two scenes that stand out in the movie, the first being when Telly briefly comes home, and his mother is sitting on her hinder, smoking, nursing her new baby, and watching TV.  She barely notices Telly is in the room, except to tell him to be quiet so he wouldn't wake the baby.  Parenting at its very worst, and you just know that little baby will grow up the same as Telly.The second is the scene where Casper wakes up after the party.  He moves from the tub he passed out in, past his friend who is unconscious over the toilet, to the kitchen where he immediately drains the dregs of the leftover beer bottles and lights a cigarette.  He then goes on to take advantage of a girl who is passed out.  Wow.  Another morning in hell.Larry Clark has done pretty well with Kids, though his work with 'Bully' was better, smoother, less raw while still being on the cutting edge.  The performances from Leo Fitzpatrick (Telly), Justin Pierce (Casper), Chloe Sevigny (Jennie), and Rosario Dawson (Ruby) are more than acceptable.  Clark certainly has a talent for bringing teenage angst and degradation to the screen, and for using brutal scenes to hone his dagger of truth home to those brave enough to watch his films.

All these negative factors could have some merit if there was even a sliver of a storyline. I know my critics will say this is why the movie was made: to show there really is a subculture of kid out there behaving like this.  I felt the filmakers exploiting kids... even though I guess the actors have a choice when taking these roles. I guess what the filmakers are saying is see what happens when kids aren't monitored, or brought up by loving and nuturing adults. I think the film could have been better if the filmakers wouldn't have been redundant and felt the need to spoon feed their audience.

416141,A1C0A4R8M2XKAX,6304346158,"""sleepyhollow9063""","[4, 10]","Larry Clark's powerful film is about kids(obviously). The movie feels like a documentary. That's because the movie knows its subject very well. Early on after Telly(Leo Fitzpatrick) makes love to a young girl with shameless voyeurism he walks out the door to meet his best friend Casper(Justin Pierce). They begin to walk through downtown Manhattan on a really hot day. Telly talks about how he likes to [have sex with] young girls how he like to do it. They say it even as they pass by adults. Casper even takes a leak in the open in front of everybody. This first scene after the credits is the most powerful in the film. We realize that to these kids at least adults don't exist. If we look even deeper we pickup that these two have no curiosities, interests, values, ideals or rules to live by. They simply do what they want when they want. It is hard to listen to young kids speak like this but still thats the way many kids talk and act in America these days. We go on and see that these two are part of a larger circle of friends. We meet them mainly in Central Park. Here is another poignant scene. Casper gets into a fight with another kid in the park for running into him on his skateboard. His friends come and help him and they beat up this kid so bad that he nearly dies. Do they care no they even spit on him when there done. These kids are basically wild animals on the loose. They have no feelings no regrets all they care about apparently is [having sex]young girls and getting money from their parents. Larry Clark's powerful first film is right on one of the most disturbing i've ever seen in my life. It's also all true. Later we meet Jennie(Chloe Sevigny). She had sex only once with Telly but now she is infected with HIV. As for Telly he could care less as he tries to make love to two virgins in one day. She runs after Telly to save the next girl who he tries to make love to. Unfortunately shes too late. Eventually they all wind up at someones house where these kids makeout have sex, do drugs and other crap. Even young kids who look only ten are in on the act. Yes its difficult to watch but Larry Clark's film tells nuttin but the truth. It is difficult to believe that some kids go through this day in and day out but they do and they represent a failure at home church, school, society, and with friends.They would've been netter off being raised in an animal farm raised only to basic and needful instincts of survival.As for performance these are the most realistic i've ever seen in my life. We believe everything they say and or do is happening. The characters all look especially Telly and Casper fifteen years old. Leo Fitzpatrick gives the best performance in the movie. As Telly he sounds rude crude and has a bad attitude. His only interest in life is to ""devirginize"" young women. Everything he says sounds unwholesome and bad we almost want to deny this type of kid exists in America. Justin Pierce gives an excellent performance as Casper. He is basically along for the ride but nevertheless central to the action. He has the final line in the movie. It is ""Jesus Christ, what just happened"". We wonder along with him to as we stare at him knowing he too has HIV now because he just made love to infected Jennie. Chloe Sevigny gives a powerful performance as Jennie. She is helpless, distraught and shocked. She runs around Manhattan looking for Telly and we struggle with her in an undeniably difficult quest.""Kids"" needs to be talked about after its been seen for real man. ""Kids"" doen't tell us exactly what it is all about. There is some form of a message involving safe sex(obviously a film loaded with promiscuous sex is). But safe sex won't change these kids lifestyles or make them better people. When you watch Telly you realize something about him. His only things in life are to have intercourse, drink booze, do drugs and skateboard. The last thing he says is another powerful phrase in the film. He says ""take sex away from me and I really got nothing."" Looking at his life you can't help but accept this as true no matter how hard. You listen to his voice and everything he says and understand why veryone needs their own mixture of philosophy,religion,ideals,curiosities,values,and rules in life that works for them and them only. All teenagers should see this film and if i could i would make standard viewing for everyone between the ages of 13 and 17. This way we understand that without something to open our eyes to the better possibilities of life we might as well sit back and all just be like Telly and swing around with absolutely no curiosities or interests and have sex,drink booze,do drugs and watse away.Note: This story takes place in Manhattan. We realize that quickly. But this horrifying story of young fifteen or sixteen year old kids could quite possibly happen anywhere in America at any moment in time. In fact its probably going on now in at a least hundred different areas in the United States and most likely the world.",4,A convincing horrifying 24 hour saga,1018051200,"04 6,

I only did because I already have such a desensitized nature so watching continuous crude and derogatory sexually perverse language and acts for 90 minutes isn't something that will really make me flinch, although I do admit, it did disturb me. I admit I only purchased this film and viewed it because of all the controversy surrounding it upon its initial release back then, and never actually got a chance to see it.The film is captured in a documentary style, yet is a completely scripted and fictitious story. It is inspired by the behavior of many inner-city youths during the 1990's, and THANKFULLY due to films like this, and many other advances in sexual education for children, statistics do show that these days in 2012, teenagers are not as fleetingly irresponsible regarding their sexual safety as they were back then. Therefore, in a way, this film is not really all that necessary anymore, as in 2012, this film does not correctly portray the lives of what society used to see as an endangered youth of America in the mid-90s.'Kids' tells the very simple story of a few sexually irresponsible and gravely immature teenagers. The movie follows them throughout what seems to be a span of 1 or 2 days during a hot city summer of what I'm guessing is New York City when school is out. The main characters are a boy named Telly and his friend Casper, who really do nothing but try and up their sexual conquest with various girls they are friends and acquaintances with. We open the film with Telly as he is sweet-talking a very young girl (who is probably about 12 or 13), and proceeds to have sexual intercourse with her. Right off the bat, I would imagine many people shutting the movie OFF within the first 5 minutes, as watching two teenagers have sex in a film is downright disturbing to say the least. It is a fairly long scene that lasts a few minutes. Yet we know nothing about this boy Telly and at first the audience will buy into everything he is telling this young girl. Now as Telly walks out and sees his friend Casper, does the non-stop flux of crude sexual language begin, and literally DOES NOT END throughout the entire duration of the film. We see scenes of them and their friends, talking more trash, smoking cigarettes and pot, drinking, etc. We also catch a scene of a group of teenage girls whose sexually derogatory language is just as bad as the boys. They speak of their own sexual conquests and even though they admit to being mistreated, they shockingly seem to take pride in such behavior and disrespect of themselves.Keep in mind that the language used in this film is very outdated by today's standards. Kids speak in regular ebonics to a very annoying degree. Yet, at the time, that's the only way lots of teenagers used to speak, as it was sort of the ""in"" thing to do. So yea, just a film where white teenagers are constantly tossing out terms like ""a-ight, yo, word up,"" etc. It's silly, but hey, it's what was prevalent back then.The real plot begins when 2 of these girls decide to take an HIV exam at a local clinic. One girl I might add is played by a young Rosario Dawson, in what is perhaps her first ever movie role. No, she is in no way cute in this film even though she is very young, her sexually disturbed character will pretty much kill any charm she might have had. Anyway, it turns out that her and her friend Jennie both test differently for the disease. Jennie is positive, while Rosario's character is HIV negative. This is ironic considering that in the film, Jennie has only slept with 1 boy, and that is our main male lead Telly. Rosario's character on the other hand has had about 10 different partners, yet is completely clean. So after this Jennie decides she needs to find Telly and tell him about her disease, and to also inform him that he is also HIV positive. Yet though Telly does not know he has this disease, he continues to sleep with as many girls as he can, and makes a big deal about only going after virgins.As we follow these characters throughout the film we don't really learn much about them, yet the film really holds up simply due to the character's graphic behavior. In the infamous fight scene (which surprisingly enough gave this a non-rating, even though the rest of the film could have very easily done that... the fight scene was probably the cleanest scene in the WHOLE FILM considering the stuff these kids pulled) we have the group of friends beat a man senseless due to a petty argument because Casper accidentally bumped into a guy at a park while riding his skateboard. The man is beat nearly to death.The film introduces some newer characters towards the end, young friends of Telly and Casper who are even younger, probably about 12 years old, and are on the very same road to sexual and behavioral destruction. It's simply way too sad to watch because we know these children will eventually ruin their own lives due to their own pride and foolish behavior, but seem to have absolutely NO parental guides or role models to follow whatsoever. The only interaction with any parents is with Telly and his mother who is at home with Telly's baby brother. Their relationship is sad and pathetic as they seem more like roommates than a mother and son. We also get a glimpse of Casper's perverted mind as he oogles at Telly's mother breastfeeding the baby.Now when it comes to that night, all the kids want to do is party some more. In a pool scene we watch as a different young boy becomes very enticed by a young girl who is part of their friend group, and makes frightening advances because he wants a kiss from her. If things went far enough, we get the feeling that the kid would perhaps have raped the girl, but of course that didn't happen. The fear only goes to show how good these performances were, and as the viewer, you cannot help but become convinced by every single shot of it. The documentary style helps this feel so much more real than it really is.Things culminate with a final party scene where our female lead Jennie gets drugged by a friend, and still proceeds to find Telly. Telly and Casper try for more sexual conquests, and lots of teenagers passing out and vomiting. Just an extremely sad scene that is effectively disturbing. One cannot sit and believe that many teenagers actually USED to act like this. The thought is so heart-breaking that children can be raised and ignored in society so much that they build a life on looking for only fleeting pleasures, and have no aspirations for themselves whatsoever.So to not give anything away regarding the outcome of Jennie and Telly, the film ends on a low note, as a final rape scene puts the nail right in your heart's coffin, and we see how things end with just more implied hopelessness from these teenage characters. This truly was a very sad time for many of America's youth. You leave the film with a sickened feeling, about how people could be so ignorant, or could HAVE BEEN, so ignorant towards children as to not lead them in a better direction. But then you remind yourself, hey, this is 2012, not 1995, children don't really have these types of behaviors to this degree nearly as much as they used to. They also don't speak the same way, as ebonics has thankfully been more or less ignored in regular speak in 2012 by many.'Kids' is a very effective and disturbing documentary , but thankfully, it is also very outdated. While many will mistake the disturbance the film causes to be due to a poorly written and directed movie, many others will take notice that the reason the movie is so well made is BECAUSE of how disturbing it is. By the end, even though there is not much characterization, you still feel a certain something for the characters, and still have a heart for them. Because, in the end, they're just kids. So really, because this film is so relative towards its time era, it really isn't necessary anymore. Many who watch this now should definitely not take it so such heart, but instead do what I did - watch the film as an either an analytical piece, a piece of history, or just to see what all the hoopla was for back in the 90s. Just keep in mind that it IS disturbing, and offensive in many areas. So while it's too strong for many , others will no longer take this as the original life lesson it was first presented to be, but instead as a film where you just want to see what all the fuss was about.",4,"Very Disturbing and Graphic Portayel of Youth, yet in 2012, Also Very Outdated",1346198400,"08 29, 2012",2012,8541,"[""'Kids"", 'straightly', 'put', 'one', 'most', 'difficult', 'movies',

416146,A1W3FS1C2H4RCV,6304346158,stu,"[11, 14]","First off, &quot;Kids&quot; is a phenomenal movie in absolutely every respect.  Harmony Korine's script is amazing (I can already tell I am going to run out of superlatives.)  It blows me away that someone so young could write something so self-assured, so masterful.  The performances are impossibly real.  Add to this Clark's voyeuristic, documentary style and the result is some of the most uncompromising naturalism in cinematic history.Kids is the kind of movie that makes mainstream filmmakers blanch.  It is also the kind of movie that makes mainstream film goers confused and angry.  Naturalism has never been a particularly popular style of theatre.  If a viewer doesn't have an appreciation for the style, he/she may think the film lacking.  Naturalism depicts life objectively, imposing no value judgements.  The question of value is left up to the observer, the viewer.  It does not shy away from ugliness or uncomfortable situations.  Naturalism is often seen as nihilistic, but that is the challenge that is presents.  Being truer to life than other dramatic forms, it's meaning is more obscured.Many have interpreted &quot;Kids&quot; to be a &quot;wake up call&quot; concerning the growing menace AIDS poses to young people (I think it was even printed on the box cover.)  That is one interpretation.  I see a much more sinister theme at the heart of &quot;Kids.&quot;  For me, AIDS just served as a metaphor for a diseased culture.  These kids are sick mentally and emotionally.  To me, these hopeless characters represent an entire generation of lost youth.  Their general apathy and animalistic hedonism is a perfectly understandable response to the empty, violent, plastic, consumer/commercial culture that raised them.  Yes, they are contracting AIDS; but what about those that escape it?  What are they going to do with their lives?  Of course, this is just my interpretation.  The film itself remains objective and impartial.  In fact, I think Korine would disagree with me and that is why I love this movie so much.Watch this if you like powerful, unflinching films that challenge assumptions and make lasting impressions.",5,Uncompromising,1090195200,"07 19, 2004",2004,2145,"['First', 'off', 'quot', 'Kids', 'quot', 'phenomenal', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'respect', 'Harmony', 'Korine', 'script', 'amazing', 'can', 'already', 'tell', 'am', 'going', 'run', 'out', 'superlatives', 'away', 'someone', 'so', 'young', 'could', 'write', 'something', 'so', 'self-assured', 'so', 'masterful', 'performances', 'are', 'impossibly', 'real', 'Add', 'Clark', 'voyeuristic', 'documentary', 'style', 'result', 'most', 'uncompromising', 'naturalism', 'cinematic', 'history.Kids', 'kind', 'movie', 'mainstream', 'filmmakers', 'blanch', 'also', 'kind', 'movie', 'mainstream', 'film', 'goers', 'confused', 'angry', 'Naturalism', 'never', 'been', 'particularly', 'popular', 'style', 'theatre', 'viewer', ""n't"", 'have', 'appreciation', 'style', 'he/she', 'may', 'think', 'film', 'lacking', 'Naturalism', 'life', 'objectively', 'imposing', 'value', 'judgements', 'question', 'value', 'left', 'up', 'observer', 'viewer', 'not', 'shy', 'away', 'ugliness', 'uncomfortable', 'situations', 'Naturalism', 'often', 'seen', 'nihilistic', 'challenge', 'presents', 'Being', 'truer', 'life', 'other', 'dramatic', 'forms', 'meaning', 'more', 'obscured.Many', 'have', 'interpreted', 'quot', 'Kids', 'quot', 'be', 'quot', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'quot', 'concerning', 'growing', 'menace', 'AIDS', 'young', 'people', 'think', 'was', 'even', 'printed', 'box', 'cover', 'one', 'interpretation', 'see', 'much', 'more', 'sinister', 'theme', 'heart', 'quot', 'Kids.', 'quot', 'AIDS', 'just', 'served', 'metaphor', 'diseased', 'culture', 'kids', 'are', 'sick', 'mentally', 'emotionally', 'hopeless', 'characters', 'represent', 'entire', 'generation', 'lost', 'youth', 'general', 'apathy', 'animalistic', 'hedonism', 'perfectly', 'understandable', 'response', 'empty', 'violent', 'plastic', 'consumer/commercial', 'culture', 'raised', 'Yes', 'are', 'contracting', 'AIDS', 'what', 'escape', 'What', 'are', 'going', 'do', 'lives', 'course', 'just', 'interpretation', 'film', 'objective', 'impartial', 'fact', 'think', 'Korine', 'would', 'disagree', 'why', 'love', 'movie', 'so', 'much.Watch', 'like', 'powerful', 'unflinching', 'films', 'challenge', 'assumptions', 'make', 'lasting', 'impressions']",N/A

416151,A1O60Q7LBN4MQ,6304346158,Wendy Schroeder,"[5, 7]","This movie is 24 hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment. Sex, drugs, beating on people, stealing, whatever keeps boredom at bay. There is no script to speak of, just watching them being themselves. One kid called Telly (about 15 or 16) who has AIDS (and may not know it) likes young virgins (12 to 14 year old girls). He's a predator with no conscience at all. Probably a sociopath. And his buddy Casper is a dumb punk who swills beer. He's just as bad as Telly.I have no doubt that teens like this exist. They existed back in the '70s when I was a teen. I'm sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don't have children. Perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing. I'm sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too. And small towns. And even rural areas.This movie isn't for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them.",4,Scary and sadly kids like these do exist,1154736000,"08 5, 2006",2006,1044,"['movie', '24', 'hours', 'kids', 'being', 'amoral', 'creatures', 'doing', 'strikes', 'fancy', 'moment', 'Sex', 'drugs', 'beating', 'people', 'stealing', 'boredom', 'bay', 'script', 'speak', 'just', 'watching', 'being', 'One', 'kid', 'called', 'Telly', '15', '16', 'who', 'AIDS', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'young', 'virgins', '12', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girls', 'predator', 'conscience', 'Probably', 'sociopath', 'buddy', 'Casper', 'dumb', 'punk', 'who', 'beer', 'just', 'as', 'bad', 'Telly.I', 'have', 'doubt', 'exist', 'existed', 'back', ""'70s"", 'when', 'was', 'teen', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'viewers', 'disturbing', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'children', 'Perhaps', 'parents', 'need', 'view', 'see', 'what', 'unsupervised', 'teens', 'are', 'doing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'kids', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'only', 'slums', 'suburbia', 'too', 'small', 'towns', 'even', 'rural', 'areas.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'squeamish', 'one', 'parent', 'watches', 'starts', 'giving', 'child', 'more', 'attention', 'might', 'be', 'sleepless', 'night', 'feeling', 'revulsion']",N/A

What follows are  unscripted, raw, and sexually explicit images.  This movie got me thinking  about most of the kids that I hung out with in high school and how most of  them ended up screwing up their lives.  One of the kids that I hung out  with ended up dead. For those who get easily offended especially by sexual  images(the main reason why KIDS is rated NC-17) please stay away from this  movie.  For those who want to change the direction that today's teenagers  are going, I recommend this movie(especially to show in high school sex  education classes).

But, older and wiser looking back, and looking at kids these days, I am guessing that this kind of stuff does take place, I just am sheltered. This movie has the HIV scare tied into it, teen sex, and rampent drug use, stuff people, myself included, don't often associate with young to mid teen-agers. But, bad habits start somewhere, and this film portrays it well.  As I now now, this behavior is more common than I ever could have immagined.
