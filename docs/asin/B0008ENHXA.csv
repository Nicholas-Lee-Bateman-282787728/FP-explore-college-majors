This movie is an ideal DVD for a ""sexually mixed"" audience , as the story sympathetically shows both sides of the ""struggle"" to accept and live with homosexuality. But please note that it's not heavy and depressing... no, it's an uplifting movie, and thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended.

898542,A3FNQDKGMVBBMU,B0008ENHXA,David F. Scrivens,"[3, 3]",I rented this movie not knowing what to expect. When I started to watch and had to read the subtitles as the movie was in French I almost turned it off but so very glad I didn't as I enjoyed this movie as much as any other I have seen. Laurent is a young gay man trying to come to terms with his sexuality and afraid to tell his parents and Cedric who doesn't care what people think takes Laurent under his wings and the two fall in love. Unfortunately things happen and the relationship strains because Cedric gives Laurent a choice of coming out or loosing him. My favorite scene is at the end of the movie where Cedric is driving Laurent to the airport so he could go to Paris and start over but along the way Laurent finally realizes what he is about to give up. A great movie about love and a must see.

There have been some good films released here...Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, Trick, Latter Day, and Saved amoung them, but a lot of them just can't seem to match the sincerity and feeling that Wild Reeds, The Man I Love, Come Undone, and this film (just to name a few) seem to have.Not that the story is anything new...closeted gay guy falls in love with very out gay guy and is faced with losing him if he doesn't come out to his very homophobic family. This same story has been done many times, on both sides of the Atlantic. It's just that this one is dealt with with no apologies. It is deeply romantic and believeable, and at the end you realize you cared about the characters and what ultimately happens to them.Laurent is a college student who lives with his best friend, Carole, who everyone thinks is his girlfriend. This suit him fine. It's not that he is ashamed of being gay. A lot of people know...just not his family. It seems his cousin came out a while back and was disowned. He subsequently died alone(though not of AIDS, as his family assumes), and Laurent does not want this to happen to him. By staying in the closet he is sparing himself and his family a lot of pain. All goes well until he meets Cedric, and he is faced between love and telling his family the truth, or losing both Cedric and his family. This is a tough choice to make, and one that is dealt with honestly in this film.I keep hoping that we here in the States will one day be able to make more than a couple of movies that are not afraid to show gay life as it really is...but in a time when even controversial director Oliver Stone has to tone down the gay content of a film about a historically bisexual Alexander the Great so his DVD will reach an audience, I think we will have to rely on other countries.",4,What Is It With The French...,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,1950,"['always', 'seem', 'make', 'gay', 'films', 'rise', 'above', 'just', 'everything', 'Hollywood', 'Indies', 'here', 'US', 'can', 'make', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'films', 'released', 'here', 'Billy', 'Hollywood', 'Screen', 'Kiss', 'Trick', 'Latter', 'Day', 'Saved', 'amoung', 'lot', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'match', 'sincerity', 'feeling', 'Wild', 'Reeds', 'Man', 'Love', 'Come', 'Undone', 'film', 'just', 'name', 'few', 'seem', 'have.Not', 'story', 'anything', 'new', 'closeted', 'gay', 'guy', 'love', 'very', 'gay', 'guy', 'faced', 'losing', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'very', 'homophobic', 'family', 'same', 'story', 'been', 'done', 'many', 'times', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'just', 'one', 'dealt', 'apologies', 'deeply', 'romantic', 'believeable', 'end', 'realize', 'cared', 'characters', 'what', 'ultimately', 'them.Laurent', 'college', 'student', 'who', 'best', 'friend', 'Carole', 'who', 'everyone', 'girlfriend', 'suit', 'fine', 'not', 'ashamed', 'being', 'gay', 'lot', 'people', 'know', 'just', 'not', 'family', 'cousin', 'came', 'out', 'while', 'back', 'was', 'disowned', 'subsequently', 'died', 'alone', 'not', 'AIDS', 'family', 'Laurent', 'not', 'want', 'happen', 'staying', 'closet', 'sparing', 'family', 'lot', 'pain', 'well', 'Cedric', 'faced', 'love', 'telling', 'family', 'truth', 'losing', 'Cedric', 'family', 'tough', 'choice', 'make', 'one', 'dealt', 'honestly', 'film.I', 'keep', 'hoping', 'here', 'States', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'be', 'able', 'make', 'more', 'couple', 'movies', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'show', 'gay', 'life', 'really', 'time', 'when', 'even', 'controversial', 'director', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'tone', 'down', 'gay', 'content', 'film', 'historically', 'bisexual', 'Alexander', 'Great', 'DVD', 'will', 'reach', 'audience', 'think', 'will', 'have', 'rely', 'other', 'countries']",Just a Question of Love

""Just a Question of Love"" is the exception. It is a very realistic gay LOVE STORY. Although the film is in French (with, of course, subtitles), the story and/or message can be translated to apply to any country where gay people fall in love and suffer the ramifications thereof.  Laurent a young agricultural student lives in great fear of his parents finding out that he is a gay.  However he has the ""ideal alibi"" because he shares an apartment with his best friend who happens to be a very attractive young women that is comfortable with the knowledge that Laurent is gay (we the audience, however, get the strong feeling she is or has been in love with Laurent and would prefer him straight; nevertheless, she accepts him as he is and enjoys him as a friend).  Outwardly, and especially, to Laurent's parents, Laurent and his roommate are distend to get married and they make the  ""perfect couple"" at least it keeps his parent off his back and he's free to play with the boys.  Inter Cedric-a handsome tutor to Laurent.  The two men fall madly in love with each other. Cedric is very comfortable with his homosexuality and not willing to live a ""lie"".  His mother is also comfortable with her son's homosexuality (or at least accepting because she loves her son).  The closet crumbles in a surprising way (no they are not caught ""doing it!"").  All involved have to face some issues (both hidden and bubbling just below the surface).All of the actors are very believable in their roles giving wonderful performances.  The film is beautiful to watch with a great soundtrack.If you want to see a very believable gay love story, buy this film(By the way, there is a marvelous water fight scene between the two lovers that I adore.

898549,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0008ENHXA,Grady Harp,"[92, 94]","'Juste une question d'amour' is a small film made for French TV that is one of the most sensitive, unbiased examinations of how the 'coming out' of gay men impacts not only the one who bravely steps forward but also his friends both male and female and his family.  So often films such as this fall under the title 'Queer Cinema' and that is as unfair to the audience as it is to the writer and director of the film.  This film is meant for the general public and should it receive higher profile in publicity, many longstanding prejudices would at least have the chance to be questioned by both gays and straights.Laurent (Cyrille Thouvenin) lives with his parents Jeanne (Dani&egrave;le Denie) and  Pierre (Idwig Stephane) behind the family Pharmacy.  Laurent is secretly gay though he lives with his best girlfriend Carole (Caroline Veyt) who adores him and wholly accepts his sexuality and is content to serve as a 'front' for Laurent's closeted role with his parents.  He is not doing well studying agriculture, primarily due to the fact the his close cousin Marc died recently and had been disowned by his aunt and uncle when he announced he was gay.  Laurent can only see that he must keep his secret so that his parents (whom he loves deeply) will not be 'injured' by his admitting his sexuality.  His marks in school are so poor that he is instructed to do an internship in field agriculture to raise his academic standing.  His assigned tutor is C&eacute;dric (St&eacute;phan Gu&eacute;rin-Tilli&eacute;) who lives an openly gay life with his warmly understanding and loving mother Emma (Eva Darlan) in an idyllic garden setting that also serves as C&eacute;dric's agricultural research lab.Though instantly attracted to each other, Laurent maintains his closeted life until C&eacute;dric reveals his affection: the two become happy, passionate lovers. All goes well until C&eacute;dric insists that Laurent be in an open relationship, a state that would demand that Laurent inform his parents of his preferences.  Laurent, fearful that his parents would disown him as his cousin was treated, flees and it is only after C&eacute;dric's mother Emma, a woman who loves the fact that her son is in a healthy relationship and longs for Laurent to allow his parents to love him for who truly he is, takes it upon herself to confront Laurent's parents with the truth.  The manner in which this initial trauma affects each of the characters forms the platform for the resolution of the story.This is a brave film, very intelligent and sensitive and informative, and is made all the better by the excellent cast.  Each actor gives characterizations that are completely credible and three-dimensional: none of the too familiar stereotypes are here.  It is to the credit of director Christian Faure and his co-writer Annick Larboulette that JUST A QUESTION OF LOVE succeeds on every level.  This is one of the most quietly powerful stories about same sex challenges to be addressed on the screen.  Highly Recommended for ALL audiences.  In French with English subtitles.

898550,A9I40WFF40R4,B0008ENHXA,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[2, 2]","""Just A Question Of Love"" is such a really good movie. The plot is one that has been done again and again. A young gay man Laurent (Cyrille Thouvenin) is in love with Cedric (Stephan Guerin-Tilie) but cannot tell his parents Jeanne (Daniele Denie) and Pierre (Idwig Sephane) that he is gay in part because a beloved first cousin Marc has just died and who did tell his parents about his sexuality and was not even visited in the hospital while he was dying. Laurent is well aware of how his parents felt about Marc, who was like a brother to him. Add to that the additional conflict between the two lovers because Cedric is open to his mother Emma (Eva Darlan) and keeps urging Laurent to come out to his parents. Of course, Laurent feels he can't right now and hides behind a so-called romantic relationship that his parents buy into of course between him and a very understanding Carole (Caroline Veyt). With a less talented group of actors, this film could have degenerated to a basic gay soap opera. The actors, to a person, are superb. They are not cardboard creations but complex many-sided characters. Emma, for instance, sounds like so many parents when she reminds Laurent that she had difficulty with her only son Cedric's sexuality-- he told her at his father's funeral-- but that she did not want to lose his love so she adjusted.  There are many other wonderful scenes, particularly when Emma tells Laurent's parents that their son is in love with her son. No wonder that Laurent tells her that he wishes she were his mother. I particularly like the scene when Cedric makes a surprise visit to Laurent's father's pharmacy to buy aspirin. Laurent's terror that he is about to be outted is palpable.""Just A Question Of Love""-- Laurent, after being outted by Emma, tells his father that ""it is not just about being gay or straight, but just a question of love""-- is one of the best films on the subject of being gay that I've seen lately.

898552,A1YEZ2LASOX97L,B0008ENHXA,Jason,"[8, 8]","The 'student coming out to family' plot has been done before, but rarely with such freshness and depth. Here are some of the reasons this film stands out: 1. The characters, especially the lead character, are more complex and conflicted than in most 'coming out' movies. The protagonist is a realistic and compelling blend of conflicts, strengths and weaknesses, virtues and failings. It makes him more human and memorable than most protagonists. 2.

898553,A18P0T2NZTGWYX,B0008ENHXA,J. Martin,"[4, 9]","After reading such good reviews here, I was seriously disappointed in this movie. It's the weakest of the seven gay romances I've watched recently (even weaker thanLatter Days, which says a lot).I didn't see any convincing chemistry between the two lead characters, although St&eacute;phan Gu&eacute;rin-Tilli&eacute; is one of those straight French actors who play gay very convincingly. His C&eacute;dric is mature, sensible and intensely masculine, with a kind of controlled, smoldering fire that's profoundly attractive. I can see why just about anybody would fall for him.But Cyrille Thouvenin's Laurent is just a pain in the [...], a spoiled, petulant, completely selfish 20-something baby who sulks and throws tantrums at the drop of a hat and is generally about as unattractive as a grown man can be. I don't believe for a minute that a cool guy like C&eacute;dric would look twice at Laurent, much less hang around after the first tantrum. If Laurent were supposed to be in his early teens, his behavior might be a little easier to take, but he's supposed to be close to finishing university, an age when men who throw tantrums are seriously unattractive regardless of sexual orientation. He spouts pretentious poetry and misses his dead cousin--so what? That's no excuse for being such a jerk. He's just a big baby, and he's not even cute.Another French movie with a spoiled young coming-outer is ""&Agrave; cause d'un garon"" (You'll Get Over It), in which Julien Baumgartner plays a similarly self-centered seventeen-year-old. But in addition to being a lot younger and better behaved, Baumgartner's character has many other redeeming qualities, including gentleness, a genuinely haunting melancholy, and tons of charm; overall he's a much more complex and interesting person. Laurent, in this movie, has no positive qualities at all that I can see.There are also big problems with the movie's credibility. C&eacute;dric is supposed to be such an eminent research botanist that the French government let him work from home, but his lab looks like a middle-school science project, and you sense that the pseudo-scientific dialog sounds ridiculous even to the actors speaking it. Then when C&eacute;dric and Laurent have a cutesy water fight in the lab using random containers of variously-colored liquids, and end up splashing their way to bed through the flooded lab floor, any remaining credibility vanishes.Another particularly incredible development is when Laurent's parents don't even recognize C&eacute;dric when he comes to visit them, just a few weeks after an ominous surprise visit to the family pharmacy that traumatized Laurent, took place with his mother watching curiously, and ignited yet another tantrum when Laurent got back to the lab. Maybe Mom's thick glasses are supposed to be the excuse, but they don't seem much of a handicap in other scenes.Most of the supporting characters aren't much better than Laurent is. They're one-dimensional and cartoonish, played by not very good actors. Laurent's parents and ""girlfriend"" are nearly as obnoxious and shallow as Laurent is, so maybe it just runs in the family.The only supporting character who's interesting at all is C&eacute;dric's mother Emma, played beautifully by Eva Darlan. When she alone has the good sense to cut through the drama-queen crap and tell the truth, her reward is Laurent's biggest tantrum ever and his insistence at the end of the movie that she go into therapy. I think that demand is supposed to be cute, but for me it was just the nail that sealed the coffin on this unpalatable mess of a movie. I'd give it one star, but I'm saving that for a really awful movie, which--thanks only to Gu&eacute;rin-Tilli&eacute; and Darlan--this one barely misses being.",2,"Disappointing, unbelievable.",1230508800,"12 29, 2008",2008,3760,"['reading', 'such', 'good', 'reviews', 'here', 'was', 'seriously', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'weakest', 'seven', 'gay', 'romances', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'recently', 'even', 'weaker', 'thanLatter', 'Days', 'lot', '.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'convincing', 'chemistry', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'St', 'eacute', 'Gu', 'eacute', 'rin-Tilli', 'eacute', 'one', 'straight', 'French', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'gay', 'very', 'convincingly', 'C', 'eacute', 'mature', 'sensible', 'intensely', 'masculine', 'kind', 'controlled', 'smoldering', 'fire', 'profoundly', 'attractive', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'just', 'anybody', 'would', 'fall', 'him.But', 'Cyrille', 'Thouvenin', 'Laurent', 'just', 'pain', '[', ']', 'spoiled', 'petulant', 'completely', 'selfish', '20-something', 'baby', 'who', 'tantrums', 'drop', 'hat', 'generally', 'about', 'as', 'unattractive', 'grown', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'minute', 'cool', 'guy', 'C', 'eacute', 'would', 'look', 'twice', 'Laurent', 'much', 'less', 'hang', 'first', 'tantrum', 'Laurent', 'were', 'supposed', 'be', 'early', 'teens', 'behavior', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'easier', 'take', 'supposed', 'be', 'close', 'finishing', 'university', 'age', 'when', 'men', 'who', 'throw', 'tantrums', 'are', 'seriously', 'unattractive', 'regardless', 'sexual', 'orientation', 'pretentious', 'poetry', 'dead', 'cousin', 'what', 'excuse', 'being', 'such', 'jerk', 'just', 'big', 'baby', 'not', 'even', 'cute.Another', 'French', 'movie', 'spoiled', 'young', 'coming-outer', 'Agrave', 'cause', ""d'un"", 'garon', ""'ll"", 'Get', 'Julien', 'Baumgartner', 'similarly', 'self-centered', 'seventeen-year-old', 'addition', 'being', 'lot', 'younger', 'better', 'behaved', 'Baumgartner', 'character', 'many', 'other', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'including', 'gentleness', 'genuinely', 'haunting', 'melancholy', 'tons', 'charm', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'interesting', 'person', 'Laurent', 'movie', 'positive', 'qualities', 'can', 'see.There', 'are', 'also', 'big', 'problems', 'movie', 'credibility', 'C', 'eacute', 'dric', 'supposed', 'be', 'such', 'eminent', 'research', 'botanist', 'French', 'government', 'let', 'work', 'home', 'lab', 'looks', 'middle-school', 'science', 'project', 'sense', 'pseudo-scientific', 'dialog', 'ridiculous', 'even', 'actors', 'speaking', 'Then', 'when', 'C', 'eacute', 'dric', 'Laurent', 'have', 'cutesy', 'water', 'fight', 'lab', 'using', 'random', 'containers', 'variously-colored', 'liquids', 'end', 'up', 'splashing', 'way', 'bed', 'flooded', 'lab', 'floor', 'remaining', 'credibility', 'vanishes.Another', 'particularly', 'incredible', 'development', 'when', 'Laurent', 'parents', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize', 'C', 'eacute', 'dric', 'when', 'visit', 'just', 'few', 'weeks', 'ominous', 'surprise', 'visit', 'family', 'pharmacy', 'traumatized', 'Laurent', 'took', 'place', 'mother', 'watching', 'curiously', 'ignited', 'yet', 'tantrum', 'when', 'Laurent', 'got', 'back', 'lab', 'Maybe', 'Mom', 'thick', 'glasses', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'excuse', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'much', 'handicap', 'other', 'scenes.Most', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'much', 'better', 'Laurent', ""'re"", 'one-dimensional', 'cartoonish', 'played', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Laurent', 'parents', 'girlfriend', 'are', 'nearly', 'as', 'obnoxious', 'shallow', 'Laurent', 'so', 'maybe', 'just', 'family.The', 'only', 'supporting', 'character', 'who', 'interesting', 'C', 'eacute', 'dric', 'mother', 'Emma', 'played', 'beautifully', 'Eva', 'Darlan', 'When', 'alone', 'good', 'sense', 'cut', 'drama-queen', 'crap', 'tell', 'truth', 'reward', 'Laurent', 'biggest', 'tantrum', 'ever', 'insistence', 'end', 'movie', 'go', 'therapy', 'think', 'demand', 'supposed', 'be', 'cute', 'was', 'just', 'nail', 'sealed', 'coffin', 'unpalatable', 'mess', 'movie', ""'d"", 'give', 'one', 'star', ""'m"", 'saving', 'really', 'awful', 'movie', 'thanks', 'only', 'Gu', 'eacute', 'rin-Tilli', 'eacute', 'Darlan', 'one', 'barely', 'being']",Just a Question of Love

898557,A8QG61LYK0XO1,B0008ENHXA,JUST A REVIEWER2,"[46, 46]",".......you're there, right there, for every tumultuous and fun-loving moment of it!(1)  WOW!!......and DOUBLEWOW!!  You've just got to hand it to the French.  In this reviewer's opinion only they, thus far in ""gay filmdom,"" seem to have been truly capturing that ""certain naturalness"" all of us look for in a male couple's touching, kissing and relating to one another.  All of you know what it is; it's a ""something"" which American directors have merely come close to achieving, perhaps in such films** as C. Jay Cox's ""Latter Days"" and Julie Davis's ""All Over the Guy.""  All this leads to a couple of big questions:  Why does it seem, in practically all American gay films, that the act of a kiss most often comes across as ""just a task"" which has to be accomplished (and in front of the camera to boot---isn't that so embarrassing!)  And what about even the simplest passing touch between partners in a scene?  Why would a US actor, in preparing for a gay role, never think of doing something as small but meaningful as that?  Whatever the answer, our actors mostly just don't (and American directors do not seem to take the time to ensure that they do, or even to ""instruct"" them on kissing halfway decently, for that matter).  If our directors are going to spend all that money and effort, why not do it right?  In summing up this lead-in, it has to be again asked:  why is it so natural and easy for the French?  (see, also, that 1997 French title, ""The Man I Love"")(or France's 2000 ""Come Undone"" with its beach-side copulation scene).(2)  Moving on now, more directly into this film, it's got to be said that these 2 French actors have Chemistry (that's spelled with a capital ""C""......and, well, you just gotta make the ""H"", the ""E"", the ""M"" and all the rest of 'em, capital letters, too).  Plus, as actors, these guys are not afraid to express their feelings by making that extra gesture of a passing touch or hand-on-arm (as noted above, how often we don't see that from American actors).  There's a very striking feeling, projected by this film, that really makes you have to wonder:  if these guys weren't already in love prior to filming, then surely mustn't they have become so during the process.......at least that's the feeling which their performances so vividly project to the audience.  It's what we're left with after watching this film:  THAT WAS REALLY LOVE!  (What greater mark of success could be asked for, or achieved, in setting a gay romance on film?)(3)  One other important point on their performances:  while the actors portraying Laurent and Cedric can be so explosive in their expressiveness toward each other, they also make themselves such fun to be with (as a viewer you feel as if you're right there, actually sharing their fun, excitement and joy in discovering sex and love with each other).  Make note of these things as you watch, and see if your pulse-rate doesn't go way up on more than one occasion......as well as your ""chuckle-bone"" getting a good workout.  What it all boils down to is simply that seeing and experiencing their strongly expressed feelings for each other is worth a 1000 times the price of admission.As a little bit of a postscript, this reviewer just has to add:  Rarely has a movie title been more fitting and meaningful than this one's, especially as it is explained and demonstrated in the heartrending denouement which takes place between father and son in the final moments of the film.  ""Really,"" it tells us, ""after everything else has come, been considered, and gone, all that's left and important is......just a question of love!""SCENES YA GOTTA WATCH FOR:--Don't miss this couple's first one-on-one in the agricultural lab which is to be their joint workplace:  it's a first-meeting-and-feeling-each-other-out scene in which sparks fly---the tension between them fairly crackles  (watch the eyes; watch the eyes).--And you should definitely note:  this pair's first post-coital scene is so full of satisfaction and obvious feelings for one another  (what such heterosexual scene of the past could top it?)  that those feelings practically jump off the screen.  It's only topped, moments later, during a scene in which ""Mom"" walks in on the pair, unannounced----it's beyond priceless.--Even more telling is the ""water-fight"" scene:  you've never seen such fun and joy over being together expressed by a gay couple in any previous movie  (watch the eyes; watch the eyes).  No wonder this scene leads to the one which it does.**David Moreton's 1998 ""Edge of Seventeen"" set an earlier standard for more realistic love-making",5,These 2 guys fall in love....and................,1118102400,"06 7, 2005",2005,4596,"['.you', ""'re"", 'there', 'right', 'there', 'tumultuous', 'fun-loving', 'moment', '1', 'WOW', 'DOUBLEWOW', ""'ve"", 'just', 'got', 'hand', 'French', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'only', 'thus', 'far', 'gay', 'filmdom', 'seem', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'capturing', 'certain', 'naturalness', 'look', 'male', 'couple', 'touching', 'kissing', 'relating', 'one', 'know', 'what', 'something', 'American', 'directors', 'have', 'merely', 'come', 'close', 'achieving', 'perhaps', 'such', 'films**', 'C.', 'Jay', 'Cox', 'Latter', 'Days', 'Julie', 'Davis', 'Guy', 'couple', 'big', 'questions', 'Why', 'seem', 'practically', 'American', 'gay', 'films', 'act', 'kiss', 'most', 'often', 'across', 'just', 'task', 'be', 'accomplished', 'front', 'camera', 'boot', '-is', ""n't"", 'so', 'embarrassing', 'what', 'even', 'simplest', 'passing', 'touch', 'partners', 'scene', 'Why', 'would', 'US', 'actor', 'preparing', 'gay', 'role', 'never', 'think', 'doing', 'something', 'small', 'meaningful', 'answer', 'actors', 'mostly', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'American', 'directors', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'take', 'time', 'ensure', 'do', 'even', 'instruct', 'kissing', 'halfway', 'decently', 'matter', 'directors', 'are', 'going', 'spend', 'money', 'effort', 'why', 'not', 'do', 'right', 'summing', 'up', 'lead-in', 'be', 'again', 'asked', 'why', 'so', 'natural', 'easy', 'French', 'see', 'also', '1997', 'French', 'title', 'Man', 'Love', 'France', '2000', 'Come', 'Undone', 'beach-side', 'copulation', 'scene', '2', 'Moving', 'now', 'more', 'directly', 'film', 'got', 'be', 'said', '2', 'French', 'actors', 'have', 'Chemistry', 'spelled', 'capital', 'C', 'well', 'just', 'got', 'ta', 'make', 'H', 'E', 'M', 'rest', ""'em"", 'capital', 'letters', 'too', 'actors', 'guys', 'are', 'not', 'afraid', 'express', 'feelings', 'making', 'extra', 'gesture', 'passing', 'touch', 'hand-on-arm', 'noted', 'how', 'often', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'American', 'actors', 'very', 'striking', 'feeling', 'projected', 'film', 'really', 'have', 'wonder', 'guys', 'were', ""n't"", 'already', 'love', 'prior', 'filming', 'then', 'surely', 'must', ""n't"", 'have', 'become', 'so', 'process', '.at', 'least', 'feeling', 'performances', 'so', 'vividly', 'project', 'audience', 'what', ""'re"", 'left', 'watching', 'film', 'WAS', 'REALLY', 'LOVE', 'What', 'greater', 'mark', 'success', 'could', 'be', 'asked', 'achieved', 'setting', 'gay', 'romance', 'film', '3', 'One', 'other', 'important', 'point', 'performances', 'actors', 'portraying', 'Laurent', 'Cedric', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'explosive', 'expressiveness', 'other', 'also', 'make', 'such', 'fun', 'be', 'viewer', 'feel', ""'re"", 'right', 'there', 'actually', 'sharing', 'fun', 'excitement', 'joy', 'discovering', 'sex', 'love', 'other', 'Make', 'note', 'things', 'watch', 'see', 'pulse-rate', ""n't"", 'go', 'way', 'up', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'as', 'well', 'chuckle-bone', 'getting', 'good', 'workout', 'What', 'down', 'simply', 'seeing', 'experiencing', 'strongly', 'expressed', 'feelings', 'other', '1000', 'times', 'price', 'admission.As', 'little', 'bit', 'postscript', 'reviewer', 'just', 'add', 'Rarely', 'movie', 'title', 'been', 'more', 'fitting', 'meaningful', 'one', 'especially', 'explained', 'demonstrated', 'heartrending', 'denouement', 'place', 'father', 'son', 'final', 'moments', 'film', 'Really', 'everything', 'else', 'come', 'been', 'considered', 'gone', 'left', 'important', 'just', 'question', 'love', 'SCENES', 'YA', 'GOT', 'TA', 'WATCH', 'FOR', 'Do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'couple', 'first', 'one-on-one', 'agricultural', 'lab', 'be', 'joint', 'workplace', 'first-meeting-and-feeling-each-other-out', 'scene', 'sparks', 'fly', '-the', 'tension', 'fairly', 'crackles', 'watch', 'eyes', 'watch', 'eyes', 'should', 'definitely', 'note', 'pair', 'first', 'post-coital', 'scene', 'so', 'full', 'satisfaction', 'obvious', 'feelings', 'one', 'what', 'such', 'heterosexual', 'scene', 'past', 'could', 'top', 'feelings', 'practically', 'jump', 'screen', 'only', 'topped', 'moments', 'later', 'scene', 'Mom', 'walks', 'pair', 'unannounced', 'priceless.', 'Even', 'more', 'telling', 'water-fight', 'scene', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'such', 'fun', 'joy', 'being', 'together', 'expressed', 'gay', 'couple', 'previous', 'movie', 'watch', 'eyes', 'watch', 'eyes', 'wonder', 'scene', 'one', '**David', 'Moreton', '1998', 'Edge', 'Seventeen', 'set', 'earlier', 'standard', 'more', 'realistic', 'love-making']",Just a Question of Love

Never mind the silly, contrived fakeries of LATTER DAYS or BIG EDEN. This film is the genuine article.An intelligent, very well-acted gay-themed drama that pulls no emotional punches, JUSTE UNE QUESTION D'AMOUR is not to be missed. Unlike so many others in this subgenre, this film achieves (through writing and acting) something rare: it generates real emotions from characters who are actually believeable. The two leads are both very attractive, but more in a 'cute guy next door' way, rather than the typically buffed model-types we see in so many other gay films. They look, and act, like real people. And because they are above-average actors, they convince the viewer of what they are going through. The main plot is a simple one: one man, Laurent, is not out to his family and fears his parents' wrath (based on the way his gay cousin was treated by his own family). He is also full of torment about his sexual preference. The other man, C&eacute;dric, is out to his mother and very secure in his sexuality. The plot follows conventional lines, with a few good surprises. It's so well-directed and played with such truth that it works perfectly.

It inspired thousands of letters praising its most deserving young stars and their story.  Try to imagine such a positive, thought-provoking drama on - much less made by - American broadcast television which is simply about an impassioned gay relationship (and no one gets sick or dies!).Cyrille Thouvenin (Confusion of Genders) stars as angry, deeply-closeted Laurent.  He is unwilling to come out to his parents because they are so virulently homophobic, and Laurent can't bear the thought of losing them.  He lives with his best friend Carole who goes along with the fiction that she is his girlfriend for their benefit.Everything changes when Laurent meets Cedric (sexy Stephan Guerin-Tillie), but they're both a bit cranky and get off to a noisy, antagonistic start.  Thinking better of it, sparks soon fly and they revel in an exuberant, spirited fling.  The delight the two beautiful actors project is authentic and gratifying.The problem is that Cedric is quite aboveboard about his sexuality and pressures (bullies?) the younger man into coming out. Laurent is truculent, uncommunicative, and defiant.  Carole is tired of the charade and has a love of her own to nurture.  Everyone wants Laurent out, but he is immobilized.  When Cedric's mother impulsively reveals the boys' secret, their world comes apart.  How everyone deals with the fallout is the core of the narrative.This transcends being just another 'gay' film.  It is about learning how to love for all concerned:  gay, straight, old or young.

898566,A2GV62JPB5RJSC,B0008ENHXA,Ronald N. Tan,"[7, 8]","""Juste Une Question D'amour"" was directed by Christian Faure starring Cyrille Thouvenin, St&eacute;phan Gu&eacute;rin-Tilli&eacute;, et al. Released in 2000 by PictureThis Entertainment.Thouvenin played the protagonist Laurent, son to bourgeoisie Pharmacist parents. Unbeknownst to Laurent's parents, Laurent lived a double life with a heterosexual guise--his live-in flat mate and female best friend Carole (Caroline Veyt) are thought to be romantically involved. Around family gatherings, Laurent and Carole would masquerade themselves in the typical young love fashion. The masks the characters wore are effective.Introducing the conflict: Laurant's cousin Marc came out to his parents and he was relieved of access to privileges and died. Suffice to say, the movie will reveal more information.Another conflict/story arc: met by Marc's death, Laurant's in a state of depression and his academic progress deteriorates. He was given an audience with the Dean of Agronomy to discuss alternative to graduate--an internship with a graduate student researcher for 2 months. The graduate student later turned out to be the significant other of Laurent.Overall, I highly recommend renting this film. I have read numerous comments that the general gay/lesbian films are corny and poorly scripted. ""Juste Une Question D'amour"" quite the opposite. You can tell from the grainy film effects of the movie that it was not a high budget film with only a few glimpses of locales.

Juste une question d'amour is a well written, well acted story of coming out and first time love that manages to avoid the clich&eacute;s that unfortunately riddle other movies like it.Laurent is a college student who, thanks to his aunt and uncle throwing his gay cousin out of the family and then abandoning him when he dies, is struggling to keep his homosexuality a secret from his family and struggling to keep his life from falling apart. He's given an internship when he screws up, yet again, but ends up finding companionship and love with an openly gay researcher named Cedric. Their affair is passionate, playful and fully exposed to Cedric's mother. Even Laurent's seemingly clueless mother notices his ""radiance"" when he comes home for a quick visit. However, Laurent's refusal to talk with his parents about Cedric's true place in his life, even bringing his roommate Carole to the family home to add to the ruse, causes an ultimatum and a major, well-intentioned interference from Cedric's mother.Although this is a French film, there are no explicit sex scenes or nudity and, unlike many French films I've seen, doesn't use endless exposition to mask a weak storyline. The supporting players are exceptional and believable as parents who have chosen or must choose. Their reactions are natural, especially when confronted with a deep deception.
