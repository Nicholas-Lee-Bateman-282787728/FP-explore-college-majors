830672,A1D2LB4Z5RMO4M,B0002CX1CU,Amanda Pike,"[0, 1]","I'd like to review the film Demon Under Glass. First let me start by saying the story is good, the writing isn't bad. The Demon Under Glass film was written by the same people who wrote the novel, D. L. Warner. She actually wrote the novel at the same time as she wrote the film.  The novel however has double the plot length, and, though obscure, bears an interesting plot. The film Demon Under Glass was a low budget horror film of the early 2000s and the plot of the film is only about half the plot. First, a comparison of the film to the novel since both were written at the same time. The novel is about double the length, in regard to story content.  Demon under glass is a very unique story.A vampire going by the name of Simon Molinar gets captured by the government. He's kept in a high tech cell where doctors study him in secret while the general public remains unaware that vampires truly exist.  Molinar under-goes several cruel experiments which cause the reader to question: Who are the monsters here? The vampire actually befriends one of his captors, a Dr. Joe McKay.  McKay was a last minute replacement for a doctor who had been killed while they were trying to capture Molinar.  Despite being a killer, you start to see the vampire as tragic anti-hero.Molinar is unashamed of who and what he is and is a survivor.  You come to realize he's not the most evil being in the story.  Molinar is cruelly experimented on.  His confinement consists of a small room with a two way mirror and a metal casket-type of box that is locked from the outside while he is sleeping.  They keep him in the casket by night, throwing off his sleep pattern, as to be certain he can't escape while they are studying him by daylight (which will burn him).  One particularly cruel test is when they expose a section of his arm to varying degrees of sunlight to see how severely it would burn him and then when it is over they refuse to feed him blood as to see how quickly he can heal without feeding. After a time the group decide to destroy the vampire now that they have finished studying him.Since he is a killer they would rather keep in captivity a specimen that has not taken human lives. It's mostly politics at this point. Molinar manages to escape and this is where the film version ends. I feel at this point D. L. Warner felt her liberty as a writer and started to stretch her legs into the world of Gothic horror / Scifi but you would have to read the novel to know the rest of the story.It's a refreshingly unique take on the vampire story. The symbolism is a little heavy-handed. Characters like Joe McKay spell things out for you with dialog that might as well be shouts of 'The vampire's not evil! My bosses are!' The novel's ending felt like the start of an ongoing book series which never actually happened.Other than these flaws I really do like the book and film. Te film gets points for being a verbal translation of the novel, unlike Queen of the damned, which had nothing to do with the novel of the same name or the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost which was nothing more than World War 2 propaganda.The biggest problem with Demon Under glass is the budget must have beena literal shoe string.The film Demon Under Glass has a laughable budget.The first time we see Molinar in the film it's before his capture. He's roaming a city looking for a prostitute to feed upon. the film makers had to tell us he's a vampire immediately by having him pause to lick his fangs.  The next flaw is during Simon's capture as the men are 'beating' him there is no sound. I don't know if this is meant for dramatic emphasize but it just makes it all the more obvious that they are pounding on nothing.The 'High tech' facility holding Molinar isn't very High tech at all. As I said, it appears to have been filmed in someone's garage and the visuals work much better in the novel. The budget was unquestionably low. The telephones used were out of the late eighties at best. Even the cell phones were out of date, looking like the lower quality ones sold in the mid-nineties, the disposable kind. I always figured a secret government agency would have nicer cell phones.  Even Joe Dawson's mobile phone on Highlander the series (1995) is more modern than what we see in Demon Under Glass. Also for a film made in 2002 and set in a high tech lab their computers look to be at least ten years old.I like the ideas projected in Demon Under Glass. And the actual story is very good. With a higher budget this could have been a fine movie. I was disappointed that the story of the film is only half of what's in the novel though what is in the film surprisingly IS faithful to the first half of the novel. It's as faithful as you can get with a very limited budget.If you can get past the weak moments the actual story and ideas behind it are very interesting. It's certainly a unique vampire film and I'd rather watch it than Queen of the damned or Twilight. I actually sincerely wish the Rifftrax guys (formerly Mystery Science theatre) would heckle Demon Under Glass. It would be such a pleasure to watch their heckling of this. I like Demon Under Glass but I love watching things I like get made fun of. It's better than some of the successful vampire films out there. It's the vampire equivalent of Plan 9 from Outer Space only with meaning and substance.",5,I actually love this (it's good AND bad),1261526400,"12 23, 2009",2009,5362,"[""'d"", 'like', 'review',

830674,A1K2ZXT12U5RQK,B0002CX1CU,Cameron Pietrafeso,"[0, 0]","This movie wasn't flashy and didn't involve a lot of scenery.  It was more one of those films that have you discussing things after it's over.  Fans of Babylon 5 will love Jason Carter as the vampire (he seems to be doing a lot in this genre of late).  It could be considered slow, but in this ADD world I find that a bit refreshing.  The situation felt fairly realistic and some of the movie, dialog, and general concepts were just terrific.So why only 3 stars?  Well, despite some great acting on the part of some of the players the talent was not universally shared amongst the cast.  Some were really stiff, or just plain failed at conveying their characters.  It is something when a bit part prostitute outshines several of the main actors. (very minor spoiler alert) Further the downward spiral of the main doc wasn't believable in my opinion, and neither was the final plot device designed to create the climax.  I also wasn't sure about the vampire's (Jason Carter) motivation, though I suppose some of that was the point.  Still they even mentioned during one scene in the film that if the 1000 year old vampire had been killing people like he had recently, it would have raised more flags, so maybe he wasn't the real killer.  That begs the question, why wasn't the brutal Vlad murders noticed before now?  Did the vampire escalate all of a sudden for some reason?  Did he just stop trying to hide his kills?  And if he can survive on transfused blood, why all the killing in the first place from an otherwise very sophisticated, inquisitive, and otherwise not malicious individual?Despite the negatives, I was still entertained for the full length of the film.

830677,A2IHIAOD10XFN9,B0002CX1CU,L. A. Adolf,"[35, 41]","Demon Under Glass is a wonderful breath of air in the horror genre where for too long, shock value and gore has overriden plot, characterization and ethical conundrum considerations.  This smart and stylish independent production is satisfying on many levels, not the least of which is the ethical dilemna which is its central theme.Suppose that vampires really exist.  And suppose that one were captured and studied by science?  Is a sentient human being who just happens to be dead, and who kills others for their blood and fear, to be given more consideration than a lab rat?  This is the premise of the film.The capture of the vampire, Simon Molinar happens at the outset of the film, as police and a mysterious commando force set a trap into which the urbane vampire falls.  Subdued and badly injured, he is spirited off to an LA area Veterans Hospital to be studied.Once here, he comes under the attention and care of Dr. Joseph McKay, young doctor working off medical school debt at the VA facility.  McKay is tapped to replace the project leader and medical doctor, Dr. Hirsch, who was killed in Molinar's capture.  It is through McKay's eyes and experience that the nature of the project comes to light and the ethical considerations are explored.Treating the injured captive, the compassionate McKay becomes drawn into his patient's life and situation.  Necessarily clued to the true nature of the man under his care, the young doctor finds a polite, cooperative patient who seems to little warrant the stringent security and strict protocols aimed at keeping him under control.  McKay's empathy is tested as he is involved in the experimentation involved first in healing Molinar's initial injuries, and as the vampire heals, the scientific inquiry that is the thrust of the secret Delphi Project he has been drawn into.  McKay is the voice of reason and compassion, who questions the right of the project specialists to conduct what seems at times the vilest sort of torture, in order to further science.  As the experimenters go farther and farther in search of answers, and as the police who have been cheated of their suspect in a string of serial murders pursue the case and Molinar's whereabouts, McKay finds himself torn between a patient who is almost a friend, and associates who increasingly seem comfortable violating the very moral code that is at the heart of  the Hippocratic Oath.Molinar is played with style and flair by Jason Carter, who makes his vampire villain complicated and sympathetic--a man who, when escape does not seem possible, agrees to give back to humanity something of what he has taken for centuries, by allowing himself to be studied and experimented on.  Garett Maggart is Dr. Joseph McKay, the emotional heart and soul of the film, who masterfully portrays a man torn between his natural compassion, his healing gift, and the moral considerations of how much humanity a fundamentally inhuman patient should be allowed.  Maggart gives a multilayered performance from which McKay emerges the quintessential hero, but not without emotional cost and a conflicted soul.  The two stars are supported by an excellent cast.For a low budget independent feature, the production quality and technical aspects are, if not great, still excellent.  With studio backing and a huge budget, this could have been one of the most talked about films in years, but would probably have suffered from having huge name stars cast in the roles so beautifully played here.This is very much a thinking man's film.  While there is drama and tension aplenty, this film never goes for cheap shock and audience manipulation.  The end result is a film that is first a drama with a compelling plot and second the most satisfying ""horror"" film this reviewer has had the pleasure to watch in many, many years.",4,Horror film with focus on story and characterization!,1086220800,"06 3, 2004",2004,3822,"['Demon', 'Glass', 'wonderful', 'breath', 'air', 'horror', 'genre', 'where', 'too', 'long', 'shock', 'value', 'gore', 'overriden', 'plot', 'characterization', 'ethical', 'conundrum', 'considerations', 'smart', 'stylish', 'independent', 'production', 'satisfying', 'many', 'levels', 'not', 'least', 'ethical', 'dilemna', 'central', 'theme.Suppose', 'really', 'exist', 'suppose', 'one', 'were', 'captured', 'studied', 'science', 'sentient', 'human', 'being', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'dead', 'who', 'others', 'blood', 'fear', 'be', 'given', 'more', 'consideration', 'lab', 'rat', 'premise', 'film.The', 'capture', 'vampire', 'Simon', 'Molinar', 'outset', 'film', 'police', 'mysterious', 'commando', 'force', 'set', 'trap', 'urbane', 'vampire', 'Subdued', 'badly', 'injured', 'spirited', 'off', 'LA', 'area', 'Veterans', 'Hospital', 'be', 'studied.Once', 'here', 'attention', 'care', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'McKay', 'young', 'doctor', 'working', 'off', 'medical', 'school', 'debt', 'VA', 'facility', 'McKay', 'tapped', 'replace', 'project', 'leader', 'medical', 'doctor', 'Dr.', 'Hirsch', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'Molinar', 'capture', 'McKay', 'eyes', 'experience', 'nature', 'project', 'light', 'ethical', 'considerations', 'are', 'explored.Treating', 'injured', 'captive', 'compassionate', 'McKay', 'drawn', 'patient', 'life', 'situation', 'Necessarily', 'clued', 'true', 'nature', 'man', 'care', 'young', 'doctor', 'polite', 'cooperative', 'patient', 'who', 'little', 'warrant', 'stringent', 'security', 'strict', 'protocols', 'aimed', 'keeping', 'control', 'McKay', 'empathy', 'tested', 'involved', 'experimentation', 'involved', 'first', 'healing', 'Molinar', 'initial', 'injuries', 'vampire', 'heals', 'scientific', 'inquiry', 'thrust', 'secret', 'Delphi', 'Project', 'been', 'drawn', 'McKay', 'voice', 'reason', 'compassion', 'who', 'questions', 'right', 'project', 'specialists', 'conduct', 'what', 'times', 'vilest', 'sort', 'torture', 'order', 'further', 'science', 'experimenters', 'go', 'farther', 'farther', 'search', 'answers', 'police', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'cheated', 'suspect', 'string', 'serial', 'murders', 'pursue', 'case', 'Molinar', 'whereabouts', 'McKay', 'torn', 'patient', 'who', 'almost', 'friend', 'associates', 'who', 'increasingly', 'seem', 'comfortable', 'violating', 'very', 'moral', 'code', 'heart', 'Hippocratic', 'Oath.Molinar', 'played', 'style', 'flair', 'Jason', 'Carter', 'who', 'vampire', 'villain', 'complicated', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'who', 'when', 'escape', 'not', 'seem', 'possible', 'give', 'back', 'humanity', 'something', 'what', 'taken', 'centuries', 'allowing', 'be', 'studied', 'experimented', 'Garett', 'Maggart', 'Dr.', 'Joseph', 'McKay', 'emotional', 'heart', 'soul', 'film', 'who', 'masterfully', 'man', 'torn', 'natural', 'compassion', 'healing', 'gift', 'moral', 'considerations', 'how', 'much', 'humanity', 'fundamentally', 'inhuman', 'patient', 'should', 'be', 'allowed', 'Maggart', 'multilayered', 'performance', 'McKay', 'quintessential', 'hero', 'not', 'emotional', 'cost', 'conflicted', 'soul', 'two', 'stars', 'are', 'supported', 'excellent', 'cast.For', 'low', 'budget', 'independent', 'feature', 'production', 'quality', 'technical', 'aspects', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'still', 'excellent', 'studio', 'backing', 'huge', 'budget', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'talked', 'films', 'years', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'suffered', 'having', 'huge', 'name', 'stars', 'cast', 'roles', 'so', 'beautifully', 'played', 'here.This', 'very', 'much', 'thinking', 'man', 'film', 'drama', 'tension', 'aplenty', 'film', 'never', 'cheap', 'shock', 'audience', 'manipulation', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'first', 'drama', 'compelling', 'plot', 'second', 'most', 'satisfying', 'horror', 'film', 'reviewer', 'had', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'many', 'many', 'years']",Demon Under Glass
830678,A11F5KW6QXHL8L,B0002CX1CU,Lasha,"[13, 19]","Demon Under Glass is not the worst vampire movie I've ever seen, nor is it the best. I am giving it one star because of the technical problems with the film (poor lighting, sound, etc.) not because the script or the acting was substandard.The premise is excellent, the Delphi Project, a secret government program which was created to solve the mystery of life itself, has found a vampire subject named Simon (Jason Carter of Babylon 5) to study. The Project has two doctors, one a kind and compassionate healer named Dr. Joe McKay (Garett Maggart of The Sentinel) and the other the cliched mad scientist who only wants to exploit the vampire for his own crazy needs.However, when a friendship begins to develop between Simon and Joe, will the good doctor try and save the vampire from the evil scientist and the now corrupt Delphi Project? And so begins the premise of the movie: Who is the Monster? The humans or the vampire?Like I said, the movie has a good start, with a good plot and the acting is quite good (except for the gentlemen who plays the evil scientist, he's horrible beyond belief and needs to be recast if they ever do a sequel), the movie is virtually unwatchable because of the technical problems.The lighting is bright in some scenes and low in others. Sound goes in and out in my copy of the DVD and the special effects are lame, even for a low budget horror film. And believe me I watch every low budget vampire movie out there. Vampire films are my favorite genre of horror.The director shot on digital film and it shows. So now I understand why the film could not get a distributor. It looks like a bad home movie gone wrong. However, the cast cannot be blamed for these problems, so cut them some slack. They do everything they  possibly can with the script and work around the technical difficulties. I give them high marks for that!If you don't expect much going into this film, you will not be disappointed. And for Jason Carter and Garett Maggart fans, it's well worth the $6.98 you'll pay for it. So buy it for that reason alone.",1,Vampires suck,1088985600,"07 5, 2004",2004,2059,"['Demon', 'Glass', 'not', 'worst', 'vampire', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'best', 'am', 'giving', 'one', 'star', 'technical', 'problems', 'film', 'poor', 'lighting', 'sound', 'etc', 'not', 'script', 'acting', 'was', 'substandard.The', 'premise', 'excellent', 'Delphi', 'Project', 'secret', 'government', 'program', 'was', 'created', 'solve', 'mystery', 'life', 'found', 'vampire', 'subject', 'named', 'Simon', 'Jason', 'Carter', 'Babylon', '5', 'study', 'Project', 'two', 'doctors', 'one', 'kind', 'compassionate', 'healer', 'named', 'Dr.', 'Joe', 'McKay', 'Garett', 'Maggart', 'Sentinel', 'other', 'cliched', 'mad', 'scientist', 'who', 'only', 'exploit', 'vampire', 'own', 'crazy', 'needs.However', 'when', 'friendship', 'develop', 'Simon', 'Joe', 'will', 'good', 'doctor', 'try', 'save', 'vampire', 'evil', 'scientist', 'now', 'corrupt', 'Delphi', 'Project', 'so', 'premise', 'movie', 'Who', 'Monster', 'humans', 'vampire', 'said', 'movie', 'good', 'start', 'good', 'plot', 'acting', 'quite', 'good', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'plays', 'evil', 'scientist', 'horrible', 'belief', 'be', 'recast', 'ever', 'do', 'sequel', 'movie', 'virtually', 'unwatchable', 'technical', 'problems.The', 'lighting', 'bright', 'scenes', 'low', 'others', 'Sound', 'copy', 'DVD', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'lame', 'even', 'low', 'budget', 'horror', 'film', 'believe', 'watch', 'low', 'budget', 'vampire', 'movie', 'there', 'Vampire', 'films', 'are', 'favorite', 'genre', 'horror.The', 'director', 'shot', 'digital', 'film', 'So', 'now', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'distributor', 'bad', 'home', 'movie', 'gone', 'wrong', 'However', 'cast', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'blamed', 'problems', 'so', 'cut', 'slack', 'do', 'everything', 'possibly', 'can', 'script', 'work', 'around', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'give', 'high', 'marks', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Jason', 'Carter', 'Garett', 'Maggart', 'fans', 'well', '6.98', ""'ll"", 'pay', 'So', 'buy', 'reason', 'alone']",Demon Under Glass
830679,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B0002CX1CU,Michael Butts,"[6, 9]","Watching DEMON UNDER GLASS reminded me of the old soap opera DARK SHADOWS, only in that its filming was reminiscent of how they used to do that 70s series.  But whereas SHADOWS opted for campiness, DEMON tries to take a serious look at how we might ""capture"" a vampire and use him to study his genetic makeup and just what makes him tick.  The movie posits the question as to just who is the demon?  The vampire Vlad or the scientists who would torture him to discover how quickly his regenerative powers work.  In the film, Vlad is responsible for the deaths of several lovely prostitutes whom he brutally beats and mutilates when finished.  As he is captured, however, we see a different vampire:  he seems appreciative of the care of young Dr. McCrady; he cooperates fully; and he doesn't seem all that bad..until the obsessed doctor in charge of the program takes his experimentations a little too far.  By the end of the movie, the vampire is pleased with who and what he is, and he sees nothing wrong in needing human blood.DEMON UNDER GLASS tries hard to be different, and in some ways, it succeeds.  The production values are very amateurish, and this does detract from the film.  Garet Maggart does well as the idealistic and conscience-stricken doctor, and Jason Carter has a certain vulnerability to match his evilness.  The rest of the cast is pretty bad, though--particularly Jack Donner as the scientist and Denise Alessandra Hurd as the police detective whose own fascination with Vlad is never fully explored.DEMON UNDER GLASS won't make you forget the Hammer Dracula films or even Barnabas Collins, but it isn't as bad as it could have been.",3,NATURE OR NURTURE,1113091200,"04 10, 2005",2005,1658,"['Watching', 'DEMON', 'UNDER', 'GLASS', 'reminded', 'old', 'soap', 'opera', 'DARK', 'SHADOWS', 'only', 'filming', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'how', 'used', 'do', '70s', 'series', 'whereas', 'SHADOWS', 'opted', 'campiness', 'DEMON', 'take', 'serious', 'look', 'how', 'might', 'capture', 'vampire', 'use', 'study', 'genetic', 'makeup', 'just', 'what', 'tick', 'movie', 'question', 'just', 'who', 'demon', 'vampire', 'Vlad', 'scientists', 'who', 'would', 'torture', 'discover', 'how', 'quickly', 'regenerative', 'powers', 'work', 'film', 'Vlad', 'responsible', 'deaths', 'several', 'lovely', 'prostitutes', 'whom', 'brutally', 'when', 'finished', 'captured', 'however', 'see', 'different', 'vampire', 'appreciative', 'care', 'young', 'Dr.', 'McCrady', 'fully', ""n't"", 'seem', 'bad..until', 'obsessed', 'doctor', 'charge', 'program', 'experimentations', 'little', 'too', 'far', 'end', 'movie', 'vampire', 'pleased', 'who', 'what', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'needing', 'human', 'blood.DEMON', 'UNDER', 'GLASS', 'hard', 'be', 'different', 'ways', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'amateurish', 'detract', 'film', 'Garet', 'Maggart', 'well', 'idealistic', 'conscience-stricken', 'doctor', 'Jason', 'Carter', 'certain', 'vulnerability', 'match', 'evilness', 'rest', 'cast', 'pretty', 'bad', 'though', 'particularly', 'Jack', 'Donner', 'scientist', 'Denise', 'Alessandra', 'Hurd', 'police', 'detective', 'own', 'fascination', 'Vlad', 'never', 'fully', 'explored.DEMON', 'UNDER', 'GLASS', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'forget', 'Hammer', 'Dracula', 'films', 'even', 'Barnabas', 'Collins', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'have', 'been']",Demon Under Glass

Seriously, this is easily one of the lamest movies I've ever seen. The idea of capturing a vampire and keeping him in a hermetically sealed coffin in a government-funded lab/hospital is ludicrous enough.... interesting that they never explain how the vamp manages to be awake and walking during the day...something vampires aren't supposed to be able to do, remember? But beside that point, which film did those who raved about the acting see, 'cause it sure wasn't this one. Everything from beginning to end -- scenery, special effects, lighting, camerawork, script (the ""writer"" is apparently known for writing sci-fi porn on the Net under another name, so what can you expect, y'know? William Shakespeare she ain't. Not even Ralph Shakespeare. Not even Shakes the Clown), staging -- looked like a high-school film project. There's one truly priceless scene where a female cop (who's a strange agent anyway, we later learn)posing as a hooker to trap the killer (who's the vamp, turns out, nicknamed Vlad... how original!)is grabbed by the vamp and kissed because, as he says, she ""looked like she needed to be properly kissed."" Not only doesn't she fight him off as any hooker (or cop!) would do, but when the clinch finally ends, actually says to him, ""Sir, you presume too much!"" It's to die for. This is almost as bad as an Ed Wood film, except it's NOT so bad it's good. It's just bad. I paid $3 for it and was still overcharged by about 4000%. Sorry, but this is NOT an intelligent film, it's just an exercise, it looks, in bad movie-making.
