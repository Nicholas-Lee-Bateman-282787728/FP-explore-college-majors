A has-been Country Music star is brought home to his small town roots to bury a brother and ""brother-in-law"" who have tragically died in a military accident. He expects a short, uneventful visit. Enter his high school lover and his daughter, both racked with trouble and disenchantment with life who have returned for the very same reasons -- but don't expect to see him.  Sounds like the usual, predictable stuff?But what arises is a feel-good film that seems to combine the characteristics of such sentimental favorites, old and new, as SWEET HOME ALABAMA, THE HORSE WHISPERER, THE PARENT TRAP and THE JAZZ SINGER. Age-old questions are answered as Bo Price (Toby Keith) comes face-to-face with himself and only girl he has ever really loved, Angela Deltan (Kelly Preston). Slow but sure, the ice begins to thaw, everbody starts feelin'...well...you know the drill.Some have surmised that Keith, in this his movie debut, would fall flat on his face.  Far from it!  Keith brings the same dry, refreshing style that he brings to his music.  Preston is also wonderful as are Tess Harper and Burt Reynolds as Preston's onscreen parents. Lindsay Haun ties everything together nicely as Bo and Angel's ""love child.""And you won't want to miss the musical value here either.  Wonderful musical offerings abound by Keith and Haun, with some nifty tunesome cameos by Willie Nelson, BeBe Winans, Scotty Emerick and others.Yep, predictable as can be but, hey, I loved it!THE HORSEMAN",5,PREDICTABLE BUT STRAIGHT UP TOBY,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,1543,"['critics', 'may', 'be', 'tempted', 'see', 'obvious', 'here', 'usual', 'thing', 'has-been', 'Country', 'Music', 'star', 'brought', 'home', 'small', 'town', 'roots', 'bury', 'brother', 'brother-in-law', 'who', 'have', 'tragically', 'died', 'military', 'accident', 'short', 'uneventful', 'visit', 'Enter', 'high', 'school', 'lover', 'daughter', 'racked', 'trouble', 'disenchantment', 'life', 'who', 'have', 'returned', 'very', 'same', 'reasons', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'see', 'usual', 'predictable', 'stuff', 'what', 'feel-good', 'film', 'combine', 'characteristics', 'such', 'sentimental', 'favorites', 'old', 'new', 'SWEET', 'HOME', 'ALABAMA', 'THE', 'HORSE', 'WHISPERER', 'THE', 'PARENT', 'TRAP', 'THE', 'JAZZ', 'SINGER', 'Age-old', 'questions', 'are', 'answered', 'Bo', 'Price', 'Toby', 'Keith', 'face-to-face', 'only', 'girl', 'ever', 'really', 'loved', 'Angela', 'Deltan', 'Kelly', 'Preston', 'Slow', 'sure', 'ice', 'thaw', 'everbody', 'feelin', 'well', 'know', 'drill.Some', 'have', 'surmised', 'Keith', 'movie', 'debut', 'would', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'Far', 'Keith', 'same', 'dry', 'refreshing', 'style', 'music', 'Preston', 'also', 'wonderful', 'are', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'Burt', 'Reynolds', 'Preston', 'onscreen', 'parents', 'Lindsay', 'Haun', 'ties', 'everything', 'together', 'nicely', 'Bo', 'Angel', 'love', 'child', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss', 'musical', 'value', 'here', 'either', 'Wonderful', 'musical', 'offerings', 'abound', 'Keith', 'Haun', 'nifty', 'tunesome', 'cameos', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'BeBe', 'Winans', 'Scotty', 'Emerick', 'others.Yep', 'predictable', 'can', 'be', 'hey', 'loved', 'HORSEMAN']",N/A

1028508,A25B8W9VSY0C5Y,B000JLTRKO,Vicki Williamson,"[7, 11]","I waited for this movie to be released with great anticipation as I own the soundtrack and absolutely love it.Let me start with my review on the performances. I will start with Lindsay Haun. She was without a doubt the star of the movie. Miss Haun not only puts on an astounding performance as rebellious Dixie but she also can sing so exceptionally well. I look forward to her debut CD and her future movie roles.Kelly Preston didn't seem as charismatic in this role as she was in many other roles I've seen her play. I loved her in ""Sky High"" as that is one of my family's favorite movies. However, I will concede that her character wasn't really a role that called for charisma. I do think she did well with what she had to work with.Burt Reynolds was one of the highlights of this movie. I thought he and Tess Harper were great as always. I loved him playing a grumpy old man that softens towards his grandaughter. Too cute!Last but definitely not LEAST: TOBY KEITH! Now I know that videos and movies are two utterly completely different things and I have to admit that I enjoy Toby's acting skills in his videos. That said, I do think that Toby did a pretty decent job in this movie, but he didn't seem as relaxed and natural in the movie as he does in his videos. However, he showed that he is a man with the ability to entertain his fans in just about any way he puts his mind to whether it is singing, songwriting or acting, which doesn't really  surprise me. He has been given many gifts from the Lord above. I have read that he is working on a script for a new movie based on his song ""Beer For My Horses"" which I think will be something he will really be able to sink his teeth into. I can't wait to see him in a fight scene. Back to the subject at hand...Toby really is a multi-talented man who I feel did well in his first full-length movie. My favorite part that he was in was when he leaned over to breathe into Kelly's face to prove to her he hadn't been drinking. That was too cute and he was so natural in that scene. (I expected ""You Ain't Much Fun"" to start playing any moment. ha!) I loved his grin in that scene.Now for my review on the movie itself. The movie was decent. The movie in itself only deserved 3 stars but I gave it 4 because of the performances by Lindsay, Burt and Toby. I feel like they were the ones who really shined in the movie. The movie was a bit predictable and some of the subplots weren't developed as they should've been. There were a couple places in the movie that you could obviously tell were edited poorly as the movie jumped from one scene to the next and left you wondering how you got from here to there. That said, I was very pleased at the lack of bad language, gratuitous sex scenes and the like. The movie was very clean and for that I am thankful.So, if you are looking for a clean wholesome movie with a story of forgiveness and redemption...this is your ticket.",4,A movie of forgiveness and redemption...,1170115200,"01 30, 2007",2007,2924,"['waited', 'movie', 'be', 'released', 'great', 'anticipation', 'own', 'soundtrack', 'absolutely', 'love', 'it.Let', 'start', 'review', 'performances', 'will', 'start', 'Lindsay', 'Haun', 'was', 'doubt', 'star', 'movie', 'Miss', 'Haun', 'not', 'only', 'astounding', 'performance', 'rebellious', 'Dixie', 'also', 'can', 'sing', 'so', 'exceptionally', 'well', 'look', 'forward', 'debut', 'CD', 'future', 'movie', 'roles.Kelly', 'Preston', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'charismatic', 'role', 'was', 'many', 'other', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'play', 'loved', 'Sky', 'High', 'one', 'family', 'favorite', 'movies', 'However', 'will', 'concede', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'role', 'called', 'charisma', 'do', 'think', 'did', 'well', 'what', 'had', 'work', 'with.Burt', 'Reynolds', 'was', 'one', 'highlights', 'movie', 'thought', 'Tess', 'Harper', 'were', 'great', 'always', 'loved', 'playing', 'grumpy', 'old', 'man', 'grandaughter', 'Too', 'cute', 'Last', 'definitely', 'not', 'LEAST', 'TOBY', 'KEITH', 'Now', 'know', 'videos', 'movies', 'are', 'two', 'utterly', 'completely', 'different', 'things', 'have', 'admit', 'enjoy', 'Toby', 'acting', 'skills', 'videos', 'said', 'do', 'think', 'Toby', 'did', 'pretty', 'decent', 'job', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'relaxed', 'natural', 'movie', 'videos', 'However', 'showed', 'man', 'ability', 'entertain', 'fans', 'just', 'way', 'mind', 'singing', 'songwriting', 'acting', ""n't"", 'really', 'surprise', 'been', 'given', 'many', 'gifts', 'Lord', 'have', 'read', 'working', 'script', 'new', 'movie', 'based', 'song', 'Beer', 'My', 'Horses', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'will', 'really', 'be', 'able', 'sink', 'teeth', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'fight', 'scene', 'Back', 'subject', 'hand', 'Toby', 'really', 'multi-talented', 'man', 'who', 'feel', 'did', 'well', 'first', 'full-length', 'movie', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'was', 'when', 'leaned', 'breathe', 'Kelly', 'face', 'prove', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'drinking', 'was', 'too', 'cute', 'was', 'so', 'natural', 'scene', 'expected', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Much', 'Fun', 'start', 'playing', 'moment', 'ha', 'loved', 'grin', 'scene.Now', 'review', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'only', 'deserved', '3', 'stars', 'gave', '4', 'performances', 'Lindsay', 'Burt', 'Toby', 'feel', 'were', 'ones', 'who', 'really', 'shined', 'movie', 'movie', 'was', 'bit', 'predictable', 'subplots', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'were', 'couple', 'places', 'movie', 'could', 'obviously', 'tell', 'were', 'edited', 'poorly', 'movie', 'jumped', 'one', 'scene', 'next', 'left', 'wondering', 'how', 'got', 'here', 'there', 'said', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'lack', 'bad', 'language', 'gratuitous', 'sex', 'scenes', 'like', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'clean', 'am', 'thankful.So', 'are', 'looking', 'clean', 'wholesome', 'movie', 'story', 'forgiveness', 'redemption', 'ticket']",N/A
