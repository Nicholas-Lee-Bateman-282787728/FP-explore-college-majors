679223,A2Y4TLOMC94CJT,B00005RG6B,Andrew,"[22, 23]","This is a brilliant piece of work from one of the most alternative and outstanding hard rock bands - Queensryche. The album &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot; (which was released in 1988), was a classic concept album and phenomenal not merely for the band itself but also in rock history. &quot;Video Mindcrime&quot; (which was released in 1989) was an excellent piece of storytelling putting the songs and music into visual image. &quot;Operation Livecrime&quot; was a further step ahead to put the story into live performance.I bought the box set way back in 1991 which made up of a Vhs cassette, a booklet about the story behind the album and a CD. The moment I saw the DVD on display inside a shop last week, I just did not hesitate to buy it. And now, here we are, &quot;Operation Livecrime&quot; in DVD eventually.The performance itself was immaculate. Every single member of the band did their respective part perfectly. They played every single song in the album. The partnership of Chris DeGarmo and Michael Wilton in guitar playing was second to none and irreplaceable but also one which supposedly every fan of the band would sadly miss. By no means I am playing down the role of Kelly Gray (who replaced Chris), himself being an outstanding guitarist on his own merits, however there is unfortunately something missing in the standard of performance (particularly live performance) of the band following the departure of Chris who had made such a huge contribution to the development of the band.There is no question about that.There is however one aspect which I sadly noticed from the song &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot;. It seems that the vocal portion of Pamela Moore was recorded beforehand, that is she did not seem to have sung her lines live. I hope I am wrong.In all, this DVD is definitely a must for every die hard Queensryche fan and serious fan of rock music. Just go ahead and buy it. Believe me, it is worth every single cent.",5,Outstanding and Brilliant piece of work from Queensryche,1006560000,"11 24, 2001",2001,1949,"['brilliant', 'piece', 'work', 'one', 'most', 'alternative', 'outstanding', 'hard', 'rock', 'bands', 'Queensryche', 'album', 'quot', 'Operation', 'Mindcrime', 'quot', 'was', 'released', '1988', 'was', 'classic', 'concept', 'album', 'phenomenal', 'not', 'merely', 'band', 'also', 'rock', 'history', 'quot', 'Video', 'Mindcrime', 'quot', 'was', 'released', '1989', 'was', 'excellent', 'piece', 'storytelling', 'putting', 'songs', 'music', 'visual', 'image', 'quot', 'Operation', 'Livecrime', 'quot', 'was', 'further', 'step', 'ahead', 'put', 'story', 'live', 'performance.I', 'bought', 'box', 'set', 'way', 'back', '1991', 'made', 'Vhs', 'cassette', 'booklet', 'story', 'album', 'CD', 'moment', 'saw', 'DVD', 'display', 'shop', 'last', 'week', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'hesitate', 'buy', 'now', 'here', 'are', 'quot', 'Operation', 'Livecrime', 'quot', 'DVD', 'eventually.The', 'performance', 'was', 'immaculate', 'single', 'member', 'band', 'did', 'respective', 'part', 'perfectly', 'played', 'single', 'song', 'album', 'partnership', 'Chris', 'DeGarmo', 'Michael', 'Wilton', 'guitar', 'playing', 'was', 'second', 'none', 'irreplaceable', 'also', 'one', 'supposedly', 'fan', 'band', 'would', 'sadly', 'miss', 'means', 'am', 'playing', 'down', 'role', 'Kelly', 'Gray', 'who', 'replaced', 'Chris', 'being', 'outstanding', 'guitarist', 'own', 'merits', 'however', 'unfortunately', 'something', 'missing', 'standard', 'performance', 'particularly', 'live', 'performance', 'band', 'following', 'departure', 'Chris', 'who', 'had', 'made', 'huge', 'contribution', 'development', 'band.There', 'question', 'that.There', 'however', 'one', 'aspect', 'sadly', 'noticed', 'song', 'quot', 'Suite', 'Sister', 'Mary', 'quot', 'vocal', 'portion', 'Pamela', 'Moore', 'was', 'recorded', 'beforehand', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'sung', 'lines', 'live', 'hope', 'am', 'wrong.In', 'DVD', 'definitely', 'must', 'die', 'hard', 'Queensryche', 'fan', 'serious', 'fan', 'rock', 'music', 'Just', 'go', 'ahead', 'buy', 'Believe', 'worth', 'single', 'cent']",N/A

I have a few Queensryche albums and I think they are really a great band overall......at least very ambitious. All of the members are great with their instruments/voices.I happened to catch this on the VH1 channel I believe. They came out fast pace rocking. The drummer must sleep for days after one of their concerts. The songs were good and again musicianship stellar.But one question? Where are the girls?? All I saw was dudes which kind of made me think that this band must be promoting more in the way of a certain sexuality.........or something? Anyway, that is their thing and maybe all the dudes at this concert thought bringing a girl along might get in the way of their rocking out.Headbangers in mullets and young as you can get.

Honestly, how many times will anyone watch the same concert, with the same songs, and the same stage show, etc.?Every rule has its exceptions.  For me, `Operation : Livecrime' is that exception.The extras are nice additions, but this DVD is all about the performance - THE performance.  Queensryche were hitting on all cylinders at the time of this recording, and it showed.  The album being presented here in its entirety is nothing less than an underappreciated masterpiece, and the stage show underlying this performance, with it's animated characterizations of the album's key players, as well as an on-stage appearance by Pamela Moore (performing as 'Mary') accentuates an amazing story.If you were fortunate enough to have caught this tour, as I was, this will bring back some incredible memories for you.  If you weren't, and are discovering Mindcrime for the first time, then this will only enhance your experience.I reviewed Operation : Mindcrime for Amazon, and stated that the album belongs in every music lover's collection.

Those were the days.  I think the height of their career came at Mindcrime and entered mainstream at Empire.  None of their albums have been as good since those days, but I still get them as they come out.  This DVD captures the Ryche at the top of their game.  Still young and fresh and Tate is in full wailing form.  This is the stuff of legends.  The complete Operation: Mindcrime album performed live and it's f*cking flawless!  I've watched it three times already and still can't get enough.  The extras aren't the bomb, the interviews with Tate are insightful and watchable.  The easter eggs are: The Lady Wore Black - Live and Roads To Madness- Live, but it's just the audio and you can get those gems off of the LIVEcrime CD, so don't bother.

I just purchased at the Moore. Here's a quick breakdown.Visually: Mindcrime at the Moore LOOKS great. It is visually far superior to Livecrime. Livecrime suffers from the seizure inducing montage editing that was popular at the time. Both fair well but EDGE Moore.Music: Livecrime is much more dynamic in the sound realm. There is a much better energy. Moore has the advantage of being on blu-ray and mixed in dolby 5.1 (you don't do heavy metal in Dubly ... sorry, couldn't resist)Moore also packs 2 albums worth of music on one disk. Mindcrime I&II; are performed. EDGE - EvenMiscellaneous: If you are only buying 1 disk here's what to consider. Livecrime has the band in their prime with the original lineup. Moore has more material and benefits from technology. Thee is also an extra of Ronnie James Dio singing the Dr. X part in mindcrime II. HOWEVER, it is only an extra and the sound is terrible compared to either feature. This was the biggest disappointment about Moore for me. Couldn't they have gotten Dio into the feature ... really.Conclusions: I bought both. If you are an older fan, like me, I prefer the Livecrime disk. If you like the newer material and are a technogeek, Moore will be more to your liking.
