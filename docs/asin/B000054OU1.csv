The package may say it is digitally MASTERED but it is NOT digitally REmastered!  There was no restoration work done on this disc whatsoever, and it shows.  The quality is barely passable, and probably was dubbed off older vhs tapes.  I think the other reviewers were just so ecstatic that these episodes were even available on DVD that their judgement got the best of them.  In summary, if you can find this disc for a couple of bucks go for it, otherwise, you'd be better off getting the Rifleman and Wagon Train on other DVD editions.",2,Not as good as the other reviewers said!,1100649600,"11 17, 2004",2004,600,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'other', 'reviews', 'rated', 'disc', 'so', 'highly', 'package', 'may', 'say', 'digitally', 'MASTERED', 'NOT', 'digitally', 'REmastered', 'was', 'restoration', 'work', 'done', 'disc', 'whatsoever', 'quality', 'barely', 'passable', 'probably', 'was', 'dubbed', 'off', 'older', 'vhs', 'tapes', 'think', 'other', 'reviewers', 'were', 'just', 'so', 'ecstatic', 'episodes', 'were', 'even', 'available', 'DVD', 'judgement', 'got', 'best', 'summary', 'can', 'find', 'disc', 'couple', 'bucks', 'go', 'otherwise', ""'d"", 'be', 'better', 'getting', 'Rifleman', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'other', 'DVD', 'editions']",TV Classic Westerns: Bat Masterson/Death Valley Days/The Rifleman/Wagon
