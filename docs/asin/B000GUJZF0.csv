1007607,ATB7BNFP1P1S3,B000GUJZF0,Age Of The Wheel,"[1, 2]","This is not a perfect movie, but neither is it a bad one.  At the time it was filmed, the producers didn't have the luxury of pacing it into a limited-run series on HBO/Cinemax/Showtime-------ie, a ten or twenty hour movie which could be spread out over several weekly episodes (much like Masterpiece Theatre did with so many other novels).  So what you've got is a very condensed and edited movie which begs to re-done on cable (the only reason that TWIN PEAKS ended so disasterously in the middle of the second season is that it probably should have been filmed as a year-long, ""finite"" series...but the nature of TV in 1990 was such that no series got produced without a five-year-run in mind).I first saw this when I was nine or ten, on TV (1972?).  I didn't understand a word of it, but the images never left me.  Three years ago I googled ""Michael Caine, Anthony Quinn"", and finally got the title.  I enjoyed the movie, then ordered the book.  At first the book seemed overly verbose, so I tossed it in the ""for free"" box in the laundry room at my apartment complex.  Three days later I fished it right back out, and spent the next three weeks reading 25-50 pages per night.",5,"Not perfect, but definitely not ""bad""",1329264000,"02 15, 2012",2012,1180,"['not', 'perfect', 'movie', 'bad', 'one', 'time', 'was', 'filmed', 'producers', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'luxury', 'pacing', 'limited-run', 'series', 'HBO/Cinemax/Showtime', '-ie', 'ten', 'twenty', 'hour', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'spread', 'out', 'several', 'weekly', 'episodes', 'much', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'did', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'novels', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'very', 'condensed', 'edited', 'movie', 're-done', 'cable', 'only', 'reason', 'TWIN', 'PEAKS', 'ended', 'so', 'disasterously', 'middle', 'second', 'season', 'probably', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'filmed', 'year-long', 'finite', 'series', 'nature', 'TV', '1990', 'was', 'such', 'series', 'got', 'produced', 'five-year-run', 'mind', '.I', 'first', 'saw', 'when', 'was', 'nine', 'ten', 'TV', '1972', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'word', 'images', 'never', 'left', 'Three', 'years', 'ago', 'googled', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'finally', 'got', 'title', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'then', 'ordered', 'book', 'first', 'book', 'seemed', 'overly', 'verbose', 'tossed', 'free', 'box', 'laundry', 'room', 'apartment', 'complex', 'Three', 'days', 'later', 'fished', 'right', 'back', 'spent', 'next', 'three', 'weeks', 'reading', '25-50', 'pages', 'night']",The Magus

1007610,A2XFII4E73279L,B000GUJZF0,"Charles Justus Garard ""Charles J. Garard Jr. PhD""","[2, 2]","This is one film, based on the excellent existentialist novel by one of the greatest British authors since Thomas Hardy and D.H. Lawrence, that should have been a success. After all, author John Fowles wrote the screenplay himself. Fowles admitted that he greatly admired Lawrence, and it is, therefore, a pity that this film version of his novel didn't turn out as well as film versions of Lawrence's SONS AND LOVERS and WOMEN IN LOVE.I read the novel before I even went to college and discussed it with some of my newspaper colleagues. I didn't know anything about existentialism or the meta-theatre at the time, but I was still able to enjoy it as a compelling mystery-adventure in which the author took us through a labyrinth of twists and turns that seemed to come to life on the page because of his mastery with visual images. This novel, the first version printed a decade before his revised version, was, I thought, the best literary effort I had read since the American novelist Thomas Wolfe's LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL. Let's face it. Some novels -- as well as some films -- just hit us that way. Sometimes we don't even know why. When the film was released, I saw it with a friend who managed a small movie theatre in St. Charles, Missouri. He was totally lost by it, and like many others whose reviews appear on this page, slammed it mercilessly. I did enjoy the wide-screen vistas and the stunning DeLuxe Color cinematography of the Greek setting. I was impressed with how the scenes with the fake Nazi soldiers were contrasted with the scenes, from Conchis' memory, of the real Nazi soldiers, and of how the mystical figures from arcane mythology were brought to life for Urfe, played by Michael Caine in his salad days. I didn't hate the film as many others have, including Woody Allen. I just saw it as something different from the novel.The extent to which readers are invited, or even required, to participate in a novel may actually be detrimental to a film adaptation.  A novel such as THE MAGUS, which emphasizes participation in the narrative more than explanations and literal interpretations -- which involves readers experientially as well as intellectually -- creates its own deep impressions. Where these impressions are caused by the novel's imagery, conflicts may arise when the reader contrasts his/her mental image with the actual image produced on the theatre screen. If, for example, we agree with critics who feel that director Guy Green's straightforward point of view provides an objective, documentary realism, then we might find his filming of Fowles' script to be an odd mix when combined with the subjective flashbacks. One flashback, in fact, combines Conchis' reminiscences of his meeting and courting Lily (played in typical stiff fashion by Candice Bergen)  -- told in silent images with Anthony Quinn's voice-over narration -- with images of authentic-looking enlistment posters superimposed over black-and-white drawings and newsreel-type footage of the First World War.Other reviewers have compared this to a David Lynch film, and it does create an entertaining moment or two for us to speculate on what Lynch might have done with the material. At the time, the late sixties, someone even wondered what the film might have been like if Byron Forbes had directed this film, instead of Guy Green, in the style that he had directed DEADFALL about the same time -- with its flourishes of quick cutting and inter-cutting, beautiful images of Spain, and its soundtrack lushly filled with John Barry's haunting music. Maybe Forbes and Barry would have improved this film, and maybe Lynch could, today, give it the quirkiness that Fowles blueprints for us, but this isn't want happened. Critic John Russell Taylor even wonders what a Federico Fellini would have done with the complex story.Green may resist throwing a circus of special effects at us, spicing up the complex tale with surrealistic wide-angle shots and zoom shots, but his point of view is hardly objective. Those critics who fault his point of view should not forget that Urfe's narrative in the novel is chronological, particularly as it details aspects of his early life. Only Conchis' installments of his early life, which exist as descriptively delineated stories within the larger story of Urfe's experience, disrupt the narrative structure. Green's film, in fact, dispenses with the book's lengthy beginning in London and uses flashbacks to deal with the necessary exposition. Immediately in the film we are shown a few 1960-ish quick cuts to show Urfe's thoughts, and though this technique does not occupy the majority of the film, it is effective as a tantalizing beginning.Perhaps I defend this film THE MAGUS because I waited a long time for it, as well as Forbes' DEADFALL, to appear on DVD.  Finally, long after I needed it for my dissertation on John Fowles, which later became the book POINT OF VIEW IN FICTION AND FILM: FOCUS ON JOHN FOWLES (sorry for the shameless plug for a work that is no longer in print), the DVD appeared. Seeing it on a sharp-imaged, wide-screen DVD after many years -- even after Fowles revised his own novel in the last 1970s long after the film version that was based on his first version -- was thrilling. It was fun to see Urfe (Caine) again read the quote from T.S. Eliot from a book conveniently left on the beach with a ribbon indicating a significant passage for him; it was fun because I had studied Eliot in the intervening years and now had a new appreciation for why this one quote was significant to Urfe's (Caine's) character.Maybe someday the BBC will film a longer version and add the necessary scenes that were omitted from this version, but this is outside speculation. We must, in a true existential sense, deal with what we have. After all, we have seen countless other films that received higher praise that probably did not deserve it. We have seen garbage movies thrown onto a DVD for no visible reason other to make a buck or two. THE MAGUS, at least, whatever its perceived faults, is a classy production with a young Michael Caine, the always superb Anthony Quinn, and the lovely Anna Karina (Mrs. Jean-Luc Godard) who plays Urfe's original love interest as French instead of the Australian air hostess that she is in the book.But if the BBC doesn't make a satisfying version of this modern classic, call David Lynch.",4,T.

Socha,"[1, 2]","I saw it around 1969 in Isla Vista, California, the student community adjacent to UCSB and famous for a while for burning down the Bank of America.About a dozen years later, the author REVISED the book, citing that he was quite young when it was originally written and that a lot of stuff deemed mysterious or symbolic in the original was just bad writing. This movie is based on the original version, which may explain a lot!I recently found the DVD for $5 at a big box store, and watched it again with some embarrassment.  In those days ('69), we were not yet inoculated against the unorthodox, despite the coverage of ""hippies."" We had seen many tame films, and something off-the-wall was still a bit of a surprise to a lot of us kids. I recall a friend who claimed he could detect all kinds of clever symbolism in the movie, often involving who was sitting in a chair when speaking and who was standing. Meanwhile, in dorms, people were playing Beatles's LPs backwards to find secret messages about Paul being dead.A side note: The woman playing the French air hostess can still be matched against today's young stars and come out on top in the looks area, IMHO!But it was, after all is said and done, ""Alfie, Part II, Alfie Goes To Greece.""In retrospect, a film about a young man who is punished for using women as disposable items was quite contrary to the time. Practically every (male) pop group was singing about having to keep ""movin'on down the road and leaving it all behind.""  (Later Carole King lamented in lyrics ""doesn't anyone stay in one place anymore?"")It was also touching to see a women who was deeply affected from having an abortion.  People who run places such as ""Rachel's Vineyard"" understand this. Today, a similar film character would probably upset some activists on some side of that big debate.So, it's a movie that can be best appreciated by those who were in their 20's AT THAT TIME.

Until then, you had to wait for the rare occasions it was shown on TV to see it. I would mainly recommend this film to people who have read the novel and are very fond of it. The Magus is one of my favorite books and the fact that the author, John Fowles, wrote the screenplay for the film, not to mention the interviews that are included in the DVD with people who knew him, make the movie well worth seeing. I have to admit that the film, taken by itself, is not great and might not even make much sense to anyone who hasn't read the book (or has read it but wasn't crazy about it). Still, I'm not sure why some critics seemed quite so harsh towards it. To me, it falls into the vast category of movies that are neither terrible or great. I was mainly disappointed with it relative to the merits of the novel.Out of all the performances in The Magus, the only one I really liked was Anthony Quinn, who perfectly captured the enigmatic Conchis. Michael Caine and Candace Bergen are both good actors (and seem improbably young in this 1968 film!), but neither really stood out in this film. Caine as Nicholas, the young man who gets ensnared in Conchis' deceitful web on a remote Greek island, never seems to be experiencing any real confusion or torment. While the novel evokes a profound sense of existentialist dread, the film seems more like a bizarre theme park.The premise of The Magus is a fascinating one. On the surface, it's about a rather aimless and self-centered young man, Nicholas, who is teaching on a Greek island and meets a mysterious older man, Maurice Conchis. As Conchis relates events of his life, people and scenes appear to Nicholas, making the island a kind of stage setting. Nicholas falls in love with a young woman who may or may not be a co-conspirator in Conchis' plot (in the novel, there are twins, which makes the whole situation even more complex).  It soon becomes apparent that nothing Conchis says can be taken at face value. He may be a doctor, a film producer or simply a sadistic madman who likes to torment victims. Nicholas becomes completely trapped in a world where nothing is what it seems and reality is unknowable. I think the latter sums up what The Magus is really about --the basic mystery and ambiguity of identity, experience and life.The basic theme of The Magus can be seen in much later films such as The Matrix and Dark City, though these rely much more on special effects to get their messages across. Probably the film that best captures this theme (actually a much better film than either The Magus or The Matrix) is The Stunt Man, which uses a movie set as a brilliant metaphor for the ambiguity of life. So, once again, the film will mainly be of interest for those who can't get enough of the book.",3,Mostly for fans of the novel,1188345600,"08 29, 2007",2007,2844,"['film', 'came', 'out', '1968', 'only', 'recently', 'become', 'available', 'DVD', 'then', 'had', 'wait', 'rare', 'occasions', 'was', 'shown', 'TV', 'see', 'would', 'mainly', 'recommend', 'film', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'are', 'very', 'fond', 'Magus', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'fact', 'author', 'John', 'Fowles', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'film', 'not', 'mention', 'interviews', 'are', 'included', 'DVD', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'make', 'movie', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing', 'have', 'admit', 'film', 'taken', 'not', 'great', 'might', 'not', 'even', 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'read', 'was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'Still', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'critics', 'seemed', 'quite', 'so', 'harsh', 'towards', 'vast', 'category', 'movies', 'are', 'terrible', 'great', 'was', 'mainly', 'disappointed', 'relative', 'merits', 'novel.Out', 'performances', 'Magus', 'only', 'one', 'really', 'liked', 'was', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'who', 'perfectly', 'captured', 'enigmatic', 'Conchis', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'seem', 'improbably', 'young', '1968', 'film', 'really', 'stood', 'out', 'film', 'Caine', 'Nicholas', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'ensnared', 'Conchis', 'deceitful', 'web', 'remote', 'Greek', 'island', 'never', 'be', 'experiencing', 'real', 'confusion', 'torment', 'novel', 'profound', 'sense', 'existentialist', 'dread', 'film', 'more', 'bizarre', 'theme', 'park.The', 'premise', 'Magus', 'fascinating', 'one', 'surface', 'rather', 'aimless', 'self-centered', 'young', 'man', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'teaching', 'Greek', 'island', 'mysterious', 'older', 'man', 'Maurice', 'Conchis', 'Conchis', 'events', 'life', 'people', 'scenes', 'appear', 'Nicholas', 'making', 'island', 'kind', 'stage', 'setting', 'Nicholas', 'love', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'co-conspirator', 'Conchis', 'plot', 'novel', 'are', 'twins', 'whole', 'situation', 'even', 'more', 'complex', 'soon', 'apparent', 'nothing', 'Conchis', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'may', 'be', 'doctor', 'film', 'producer', 'simply', 'sadistic', 'madman', 'who', 'torment', 'victims', 'Nicholas', 'completely', 'trapped', 'world', 'where', 'nothing', 'what', 'reality', 'unknowable', 'think', 'latter', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'Magus', 'really', 'about', 'basic', 'mystery', 'ambiguity', 'identity', 'experience', 'life.The', 'basic', 'theme', 'Magus', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'much', 'later', 'films', 'such', 'Matrix', 'Dark', 'City', 'rely', 'much', 'more', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'messages', 'Probably', 'film', 'best', 'theme', 'actually', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'Magus', 'Matrix', 'Stunt', 'Man', 'movie', 'set', 'brilliant', 'metaphor', 'ambiguity', 'life', 'So', 'once', 'again', 'film', 'will', 'mainly', 'be', 'interest', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'book']",The Magus

""Nothing's what it seems to be...Life is just a dream, etc.""  With some sex and nudity thrown in.I read the book when it first came out and was entranced by it!  'Don't think I've ever seen the film till now...if I did, it didn't make much of an impression on me.  I found the beginning to be quite interesting.  Michael Caine plays the callow but possibly-talented underachiever very well.  Anna Karina is beautiful and gives her usual soulful performance.  Anthony Quinn is perfect for his role, which is more of a type than an actual person.  Candace Bergen looks good  and her rather wooden style of acting is ok for this part.The story is really interesting and I have the feeling that (again, to quote another reviewer) it could have been a wonderful film.  What that would have taken I don't know.  Perhaps it's presented in too literal a style for a tale that is about not taking things so literally?  I'm not sure, but whatever it would take, this version didn't deliver it.We are presented with one version of ""reality"" after another.  Just when we think that the previous versions were not real and the present one is, then another skin of the onion is peeled off and we are perplexed again.  The problem I had was that I just lost interest in the whole game way before the conclusion.The ideas presented are worthy of thought.  I particularly liked what Anne, the French stewardess, told Niko, that there was something in the core of everyone that has never been touched by anything horrible.  This is pure Course in Miracles and I was happy to see it mentioned here.  It is certainly meritorious to see the callow Niko come to terms with his past behavior, but I wasn't really convinced that he actually changed.  The ideas are bogged down by so much hokey ""magic"" and visual shlock that I could no longer care what the heck was going on.  The film seemed awfully long to me, too.It's worth a watch if you don't expect too much.

1007618,A19HDQR569CG8A,B000GUJZF0,R. Kevin Hill,"[23, 25]","One of the reviewers mentioned David Lynch. I recall waiting with anticipation for the film adaptation of _Dune_, hoping that the movie in my mind would be realized, and discovering through the film flaws in the book that my adolescent mind had not noticed when I fell in love with it. Something like that is true of _The Magus_ as well. It *is* fairly faithful to the book, and many of the more embarrassing scenes of dialogue are taken directly from it. So my first reaction to seeing this film is a troubled sense that I was wrong to love this book.What's missing? Three things: time, the narrator, and a realist texture. For a sense of what I mean by the third, see Minghella's _Talented Mr. Ripley_ to see how this film should look, should feel (indeed, how, if it were remade today, it could even be cast--all that's missing is Ben Kingsley as Conchis). But what makes the book work is that the fascinating and bizarre events are made plausible by their embedding in a realistic frame: Nicholas' life away from Conchis' universe is utterly real by being largely veiled autobiography. He is the typical callow young man as would-be writer, struggling fitfully to overcome his narcissism and join the human race, while desperately clinging to that same narcissism in the knowledge that only this will allow him to become the artist he would betray himself by not becoming. The Conchis Masque is but the externalization of Nicholas' ""therapy"" as he sorts through this paradox, grows up and becomes a Real Writer. For every Real Writer is perilously close to a merely Failed Human Being.In the book, Nicholas experiences Bourani (the site of Conchis' manipulations) the way people experience affairs: as what seems for a time an endlessly fascinating distraction from the intolerable experience of being who they are. On this level, the book is essentially the story of an affair, and Nicholas' guilt is an essential part of him finding his way to resolution. But the film so compresses the events that we get only Conchis, only the affair, and almost none of the narcissism, tedium, failure and self-doubt of Nicholas, or the process by which he comes to terms with them through his guilt over how his self-importance and thirst for experience harm the women in his life. And yet it is this which makes the book seem real (especially to the many young Nicholases who read it) and thus confers reality on the otherwise incredible, and incredibly silly things that transpire on the island.I remain convinced that this film could've been done, but there must be much much more of the ordinariness of Nicholas, so that the fantastic stands out that much more. _French Lieutenant's Woman_ gives us some inkling of how a very free but literate adaptation can be penned, and _Talented Mr. Ripley_ gives us some notion of how it could be shot. But it must be *much* longer, and that length should be devoted to showing what the novel shows: how we grow through love.",2,What Might Have Been,1180310400,"05 28, 2007",2007,2961,"['One', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'David', 'Lynch', 'recall', 'waiting', 'anticipation', 'film', 'adaptation', '_Dune_', 'hoping', 'movie', 'mind', 'would', 'be', 'realized', 'discovering', 'film', 'flaws', 'book', 'adolescent', 'mind', 'had', 'not', 'noticed', 'when', 'fell', 'love', 'Something', 'true', '_The', 'Magus_', 'as', 'well', '*is*', 'fairly', 'faithful', 'book', 'many', 'more', 'embarrassing', 'scenes', 'dialogue', 'are', 'taken', 'directly', 'first', 'reaction', 'seeing', 'film', 'troubled', 'sense', 'was', 'wrong', 'love', 'book.What', 'missing', 'Three', 'things', 'time', 'narrator', 'realist', 'texture', 'sense', 'what', 'mean', 'third', 'see', 'Minghella', '_Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley_', 'see', 'how', 'film', 'should', 'look', 'should', 'feel', 'indeed', 'how', 'were', 'remade', 'today', 'could', 'even', 'be', 'cast', 'missing', 'Ben', 'Kingsley', 'Conchis', 'what', 'book', 'work', 'fascinating', 'bizarre', 'events', 'are', 'made', 'plausible', 'embedding', 'realistic', 'frame', 'Nicholas', 'life', 'away', 'Conchis', 'universe', 'utterly', 'real', 'being', 'largely', 'veiled', 'autobiography', 'typical', 'callow', 'young', 'man', 'would-be', 'writer', 'struggling', 'fitfully', 'overcome', 'narcissism', 'join', 'human', 'race', 'desperately', 'clinging', 'same', 'narcissism', 'knowledge', 'only', 'will', 'allow', 'become', 'artist', 'would', 'betray', 'not', 'becoming', 'Conchis', 'Masque', 'externalization', 'Nicholas', 'therapy', 'paradox', 'up', 'Real', 'Writer', 'Real', 'Writer', 'perilously', 'close', 'merely', 'Failed', 'Human', 'Being.In', 'book', 'Nicholas', 'Bourani', 'site', 'Conchis', 'manipulations', 'way', 'people', 'experience', 'affairs', 'what', 'time', 'endlessly', 'fascinating', 'distraction', 'intolerable', 'experience', 'being', 'who', 'are', 'level', 'book', 'essentially', 'story', 'affair', 'Nicholas', 'guilt', 'essential', 'part', 'finding', 'way', 'resolution', 'film', 'so', 'events', 'get', 'only', 'Conchis', 'only', 'affair', 'almost', 'none', 'narcissism', 'tedium', 'failure', 'self-doubt', 'Nicholas', 'process', 'terms', 'guilt', 'how', 'self-importance', 'thirst', 'experience', 'harm', 'women', 'life', 'yet', 'book', 'seem', 'real', 'especially', 'many', 'young', 'Nicholases', 'who', 'read', 'thus', 'confers', 'reality', 'otherwise', 'incredible', 'incredibly', 'silly', 'things', 'transpire', 'island.I', 'remain', 'convinced', 'film', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'done', 'must', 'be', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'ordinariness', 'Nicholas', 'fantastic', 'out', 'much', 'more', '_French', 'Lieutenant', 'Woman_', 'inkling', 'how', 'very', 'free', 'literate', 'adaptation', 'can', 'be', 'penned', '_Talented', 'Mr.', 'Ripley_', 'notion', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'shot', 'must', 'be', '*much*', 'longer', 'length', 'should', 'be', 'devoted', 'showing', 'what', 'novel', 'shows', 'how', 'grow', 'love']",The Magus

Caine is kind of a lost soul, a teacher blundering through life who loves to bed new girls.  He meets an equally troubled stewardess, they begin an affair, but somehow he holds back from the love that she knows they might have.  Caine then meets a strange man on Crete, Quinn (who isn't all that bad), who enmeshes him in a series of games, enticing him with promises of an affair with a gorgeously young Candace Bergen, and playing with his mind; even the stewardess is somehow involved.  By the end, Caine knows himself better, is less selfish, etc., though may have lost the stewardess.Viewed from today, this has the air of a cult film, loved by some die hard fans as a deep psychological journey, but seen by everyone else as flat and clich&eacute;e-ridden, with stilted dialogue and out-dated Jungian themes in the blatantly crude symbolism.  Alas, I fall into the latter category, and not for want of trying.

1007620,A3CE57YNGVWBQN,B000GUJZF0,"Tom S. ""filmfan3""","[21, 27]","This film is intriguing at first, and it's beautiful to look at, but it's a bit of a mess. The problem is simple: John Fowles, the author of the famous novel, decided to write his own screen adaptation. He apparently hated the screen version of his other novel, THE COLLECTOR, three years earlier, and he didn't want Hollywood to botch THE MAGUS. Well, they did botch it--and it's entirely his own fault.THE MAGUS is a novel of ideas, not action. The flimsy story and symbolic characters (Urfe rhymes with ""earth,"" Conchis is pronounced ""conscious"" which means ""alive,"" the lily in Anne's lucky paperweight becomes ""Lily,"" the girl on the island, etc.) are only there to serve up a large dose of Fowles's philosophy--basically, that life is a dream and love is the only reality. But it isn't exactly photogenic, and Fowles the screenwriter has taken Fowles the novelist entirely too literally. What we get is a page-by-page adaptation of a talky, elliptical, difficult book. If Michael Caine (Urfe/earth), Anthony Quinn (Conchis/life), and Candice Bergen (Lily/love) look uncomfortable, or even downright confused, who can blame them? They were asked to play symbols, not characters, and to say and do things that couldn't possibly make sense to anyone unfamiliar with the novel. A film is not a novel, and vice versa.Bottom line: read the wonderful novel, then tackle the film. Or skip the film entirely. The screenwriter doesn't seem to understand the novelist, despite the fact that they're the same person. And that is why we have professional screenwriters. I'm glad Fowles allowed Harold Pinter to do the screenplay for the film of his next novel, THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN. Now, there's a movie that does justice to the source material.

Yet at the same time, that willingness to fail on such a large scale also leads to something dazzling & compelling.And so it is with ""The Magus.""Let's agree that the film is so much less than the book -- how could it be otherwise? So let's simply look as the film as a film. It's a sun-drenched puzzle with a few crucial pieces missing, and others that never quite fit together. Granted, that's not entirely a bad thing, as the god-game of the trickster Conchis is to constantly unmoor Nicholas Urfe's sense of mundane reality & then expand it. Urfe is left confused, bewildered, angry, but eager to learn more -- and so are we, although we also want more when the film ends. Again, not entirely a bad thing.The film has to walk a narrow line, and it stumbles on occasion. If it gives too much information, lays out things too explicitly, it succumbs to rigidity & mere didacticism. But if it lets things get too loose & fluid, then it can't do any better than disconnected glimpses that don't cohere on a deeper level. The film never quite reaches the perfect balance between the two. To be honest, I don't know that it ever could.So is it worth watching?I think so ... with a couple of caveats. It's definitely a film of the 1960s, which may be the deciding factor for some prospective viewers in itself. For those who want to understand how the 1960s felt, how some people viewed & experienced the world, it's a kaleidoscopic window on a disorienting landscape. For those who enjoy Big Questions & surreal situations, you'll certainly get your fill ... if not complete satisfaction. For those who want specific answers, though, or a stronger narrative hand at the wheel, it's likely to be disappointing -- and with just cause for complaint. And those who loved the novel will need to lower their expectations considerably!Michael Caine has said that nobody on the set understood what the film was about, which is why it failed. Even so, he gives a wonderfully befuddled performance as a very smart (but emotionally shallow) man, one who learns that he isn't quite as smart as he thought. Anthony Quinn is bursting with energy, laughter, menace, and hidden wells of sorrow -- he's a presence that overflows from the screen. And Candice Bergen, while in an underwritten role, is the right choice for an impossibly beautiful figure of desire & mystery.Not for everyone, obviously -- and even those who like it will have some reservations. But if you're in the mood to try something different, this is a great place to take a chance!",4,A slightly cracked but glittering gem,1236211200,"03 5, 2009",2009,2742,"['are', 'certain', 'works', 'art', 'are', 'enormously', 'flawed', 'creators', 'take', 'ridiculous', 'risks', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'succeed', 'glorious', 'leaps', 'sometimes', 'end', 'inglorious', 'splats', 'very', 'hard', 'floor', 'same', 'time', 'willingness', 'fail', 'large', 'scale', 'also', 'something', 'dazzling', 'compelling.And', 'Magus', 'Let', 'agree', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'less', 'book', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'otherwise', 'So', 'let', 'simply', 'look', 'film', 'film', 'sun-drenched', 'puzzle', 'few', 'crucial', 'pieces', 'missing', 'others', 'never', 'quite', 'fit', 'together', 'Granted', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'thing', 'god-game', 'trickster', 'Conchis', 'constantly', 'unmoor', 'Nicholas', 'Urfe', 'sense', 'mundane', 'reality', 'then', 'expand', 'Urfe', 'left', 'confused', 'bewildered', 'angry', 'eager', 'learn', 'more', 'so', 'are', 'also', 'want', 'more', 'when', 'film', 'Again', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'thing.The', 'film', 'walk', 'narrow', 'line', 'occasion', 'too', 'much', 'information', 'out', 'things', 'too', 'explicitly', 'rigidity', 'mere', 'didacticism', 'things', 'get', 'too', 'loose', 'fluid', 'then', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'disconnected', 'glimpses', 'do', ""n't"", 'cohere', 'deeper', 'level', 'film', 'never', 'quite', 'perfect', 'balance', 'two', 'be', 'honest', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'ever', 'watching', 'think', 'so', 'couple', 'caveats', 'definitely', 'film', '1960s', 'may', 'be', 'deciding', 'factor', 'prospective', 'viewers', 'who', 'want', 'understand', 'how', '1960s', 'felt', 'how', 'people', 'viewed', 'experienced', 'world', 'kaleidoscopic', 'window', 'disorienting', 'landscape', 'who', 'enjoy', 'Big', 'Questions', 'surreal', 'situations', ""'ll"", 'certainly', 'get', 'fill', 'not', 'complete', 'satisfaction', 'who', 'want', 'specific', 'answers', 'though', 'stronger', 'narrative', 'hand', 'wheel', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointing', 'just', 'cause', 'complaint', 'who', 'loved', 'novel', 'will', 'need', 'lower', 'expectations', 'considerably', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'said', 'nobody', 'set', 'understood', 'what', 'film', 'was', 'why', 'failed', 'Even', 'so', 'wonderfully', 'befuddled', 'performance', 'very', 'smart', 'emotionally', 'shallow', 'man', 'one', 'who', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'smart', 'thought', 'Anthony', 'Quinn', 'bursting', 'energy', 'laughter', 'menace', 'hidden', 'wells', 'sorrow', 'presence', 'screen', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'underwritten', 'role', 'right', 'choice', 'impossibly', 'beautiful', 'figure', 'desire', 'mystery.Not', 'everyone', 'obviously', 'even', 'who', 'like', 'will', 'have', 'reservations', ""'re"", 'mood', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'great', 'place', 'take', 'chance']",The Magus

This cryptic statement in John Fowles' novel may sum up the ethic behind the book and the film.  It is a question not an answer.  It is open ended and leaves you with either a sense of wonder or confusion.  I saw the film first before I read the novel, so I may not be as biased as some of the reviewers about the film's shortcomings in comparison to the written work.  It is indeed a relatively faithful adaptation of the book, although I understand Fowles was not happy with it.  It is a film in which you are led down a series of garden paths.  The Magus leads the man and reveals all, but wait...he shows a different reality.  So is this the truth?  Each time there is another ""vision"", another play within a play and each time reality bends a little more until you are not sure what is the truth or even if there is any truth in what is shown.  The main character (Caine) is callow and somewhat uncaring, foregoing rather casually his first love, and is entrapped by the Magus's lovely ""niece""(Candace Bergen).  Even though each illusion is revealed as such, it does not destroy the magic, it only makes it seem more mysterious each time.  It is a web of illusion which the man might either see as a privelege or a test.  He is either the butt of a joke or the beneficiary of a play performed on his behalf in which he is the central figure.  A mystical journey, disconcerting, disturbing at times, but in the end enlightening.",5,Do you drink the water or the wave?,1356825600,"12 30, 2012",2012,1545,"['UTRAM', 'BIBIS', 'ANDAM', 'UN', 'ANDAM', 'latin', 'phrase', 'do', 'drink', 'water', 'wave', 'cryptic', 'statement', 'John', 'Fowles', 'novel', 'may', 'sum', 'up', 'ethic', 'book', 'film', 'question', 'not', 'answer', 'open', 'ended', 'sense', 'wonder', 'confusion', 'saw', 'film', 'first', 'read', 'novel', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'biased', 'reviewers', 'film', 'shortcomings', 'comparison', 'written', 'work', 'indeed', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'book', 'understand', 'Fowles', 'was', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'are', 'led', 'down', 'series', 'garden', 'paths', 'Magus', 'man', 'wait', 'different', 'reality', 'truth', 'time', 'vision', 'play', 'play', 'time', 'reality', 'little', 'more', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'truth', 'even', 'truth', 'what', 'shown', 'main', 'character', 'Caine', 'callow', 'somewhat', 'uncaring', 'foregoing', 'rather', 'casually', 'first', 'love', 'entrapped', 'Magus', 'lovely', 'niece', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'Even', 'illusion', 'revealed', 'such', 'not', 'destroy', 'magic', 'only', 'seem', 'more', 'mysterious', 'time', 'web', 'illusion', 'man', 'might', 'either', 'see', 'privelege', 'test', 'butt', 'joke', 'beneficiary', 'play', 'performed', 'behalf', 'central', 'figure', 'mystical', 'journey', 'disconcerting', 'disturbing', 'times', 'end', 'enlightening']",The Magus
