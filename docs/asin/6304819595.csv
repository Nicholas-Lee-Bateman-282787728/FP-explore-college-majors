436363,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6304819595,Byron Kolln,"[2, 2]","In the dramatic wartime favourite ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), Jennifer Jones appeared in a train-station scene that quickly became one of the most memorable--and lampooned--in cinema history.  Nine years later, Jones starred in another picture which almost exclusively takes place in a bustling railroad terminal.  INDISCRETION OF AN AMERICAN WIFE, aka ""Stazione Termini"" (1953) is one of the most unusual and ambitious movies in Ms Jones' career.Running just over an hour, the story follows the unravelling of a holiday fling between American housewife Mary Forbes (Jennifer Jones) and a handsome half-Italian, Giovanni Doria (Montgomery Clift).  She wants to leave the affair and return to her husband and daughter back in the States as quickly as possible; Fate would have it otherwise.  Left to her own devices in Rome's Central Station until the train arrives, Mary is confronted by Giovanni...I've probably given the story much less fanfare than it deserves.  This is very much a character/mood piece; with some exceptionally-written dialogue from Truman Capote.  Director Vittorio De Sica injects the film with a neo-realist touch and extracts some of Jennifer Jones' most unguarded and vivid screen work in the process.It's another strange coincidence that both Jones and Clift had recently come from personal successes in screen versions of works from author Theodore Dreiser (she in 1952's ""Carrie"", he in 1951's ""A Place in the Sun"").  Whether De Sica cast them with this knowledge is not known, but they blend well with equally emotional performances.  Co-starring a teenaged Richard Beymer as Jones' concerned nephew, the film paints a compelling portrait of thwarted love.

It's a beautifully done black-and-white film with classical 50's music, and all the scenes take place in a Rome train station. Jones meets Clift while on holiday there, and their hot, steamy romance begins. Jones, however, is married and torn between her uncontrollable, sexual desire for Clift that she vacillates between her life as a housewife in Philadelphia to wanting desperately to start a new life with Clift.Emotions are all over the place, from Jones being slapped in the face by Clift, to them both being arrested for making out in an abandoned railroad car. Really unbelievable sensual sparks fly between these two lovers. And all the while, Clift dreams of taking his new job at the University of Pisa, living on the waterfront in a cozy villa with Jones. She is so torn between her desire for him and knowing she must return to her husband and child - you don't know whether to urge her on, or make the decision for her to do the moral thing and go back to her husband.Brilliantly done film with two outstanding actors of the time. This film really involves you emotionally and you feel for both characters. Does she leave the young, sexy Clift to go back to her older, probably boring husband, or will she stay with Clift and let the sexual tension turn into a blaze between them. Watch it for yourself and see how this romantic dilemma is resolved.A really must watch - sexy, sensual 50's film.

436369,A1DRM3JV6T5O6P,6304819595,Phillip Oliver,"[19, 21]","""Terminal Station"" was the result of a meeting of minds between two world famous filmmakers - Italy's Vittorio De Sica and U.S. mega-producer David O. Selznick. Their ideas of filmmaking were at opposite ends of the spectrum and the end result for the film was disastrous.De Sica was one of Italy's pioneers of the ""neo-realism"" style of filmmaking which emphasized a gritty realism utilizing small budgets, hand-held cameras and actors with ""characteristic"" faces. David O. Selznick, on the other hand, was one of Hollywood's most successful producers who name was behind a roster of impressive films, notably ""Gone With The Wind."" His style was more reserved, romantic and ""high-gloss."" In 1942, Selznick had discovered a young girl from Tulsa, Oklahoma named Phylis Isley whom he groomed for stardom and changed her name to Jennifer Jones.Jennifer Jones was a unique and talented actress who earned an Academy Award for her first major role in ""The Song of Bernadette."" She followed that film with an impressive list of roles that wisely emphasized her versatility and she avoided being type-cast. Indeed, only three years after winning the Oscar for her ""saintliness"" in ""Song of Bernadette,"" she shocked film goers with a brazen display of sensuality as a half-breed half caste girl in ""Duel In The Sun."" She earned Oscar nominations four years in a row in the mid 40s.Selznick married Jones in 1949 and took on her career full time. For her, this proved to be more detrimental than helpful. Selznick was a control freak who tried to dictate every aspect concerning her appearance and choice of roles. Her best films would be done by other directors and producers who would wisely turn a deaf ear to Selznick's intrusions.The De Sica/Selznick project began in 1952. ""Terminal Station"" was filmed entirely in Rome's sleek new railway station during late night hours and it didn't take long for De  Sica's style of realism to clash with Selznick's expectations for the film. Selznick insisted that another cinematographer be brought in to film Montgomery Clift and Jennifer's close-ups so that they would appear more ""glamorous."" After the film was completed, Selznick edited the 90 minute film down to 63 minutes for the U.S. release and retitled it ""Indiscretion of an American Wife.""Both versions failed at the box office and with critics. The film looked wonderful and the camera-work was stunning, especially the close-ups of Jones and Clift. But the problem with the film basically lay in the story itself - there was not too much to it. The story is told in ""real time"" and is the farewell between a Philadelphia house-wife and her Italian lover. De Sica's additions of minor characters in the station (some for comic relief) did little to help the otherwise flat story. The acting by both leads, however, was superior and the chemistry between Jones and Clift is very steamy. Considering that the film was made in the early 50s, it is also quite frank and daring in subject matter.Criterion has restored both versions of the film for the dvd and they have done a spectacular job. A commentary by Leonard Leff is very informative and covers everything from the colorful but troubled production history to interesting tidbits about Jones and Clift's acting styles and personal lives. A gallery of the film's ads and posters is included. This dvd would especially be helpful to film students who want to study the styles of two very different film-makers.",5,Turmoil and passion in Italy's Terminal Station,1061856000,"08 26, 2003",2003,3463,"['Terminal', 'Station', 'was', 'result', 'meeting', 'minds', 'two', 'world', 'famous', 'filmmakers', 'Italy', 'Vittorio', 'De', 'Sica', 'U.S.', 'mega-producer', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'ideas', 'filmmaking', 'were', 'opposite', 'ends', 'spectrum', 'end', 'result', 'film', 'was', 'disastrous.De', 'Sica', 'was', 'one', 'Italy', 'pioneers', 'neo-realism', 'style', 'filmmaking', 'emphasized', 'gritty', 'realism', 'utilizing', 'small', 'budgets', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'actors', 'characteristic', 'David', 'O.', 'Selznick', 'other', 'hand', 'was', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'successful', 'producers', 'who', 'name', 'was', 'roster', 'impressive', 'films', 'notably', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'style', 'was', 'more', 'reserved', 'romantic', 'high-gloss', '1942', 'Selznick', 'had', 'discovered', 'young', 'girl', 'Tulsa', 'Oklahoma', 'named', 'Phylis', 'Isley', 'whom', 'groomed', 'stardom', 'changed', 'name', 'Jennifer', 'Jones.Jennifer', 'Jones', 'was', 'unique', 'talented', 'actress', 'who', 'earned', 'Academy', 'Award', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'followed', 'film', 'impressive', 'list', 'roles', 'wisely', 'emphasized', 'versatility', 'avoided', 'being', 'type-cast', 'Indeed', 'only', 'three', 'years', 'winning', 'Oscar', 'saintliness', 'Song', 'Bernadette', 'shocked', 'film', 'goers', 'brazen', 'display', 'sensuality', 'half-breed', 'half', 'caste', 'girl', 'Duel', 'Sun', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'four', 'years', 'row', 'mid', '40s.Selznick', 'married', 'Jones', '1949', 'took', 'career', 'full', 'time', 'proved', 'be', 'more', 'detrimental', 'helpful', 'Selznick', 'was', 'control', 'freak', 'who', 'tried', 'dictate', 'aspect', 'concerning', 'appearance', 'choice', 'roles', 'best', 'films', 'would', 'be', 'done', 'other', 'directors', 'producers', 'who', 'would', 'wisely', 'turn', 'deaf', 'ear', 'Selznick', 'intrusions.The', 'De', 'Sica/Selznick', 'project', 'began', '1952', 'Terminal', 'Station', 'was', 'filmed', 'entirely', 'Rome', 'sleek', 'new', 'railway', 'station', 'late', 'night', 'hours', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'long', 'De', 'Sica', 'style', 'realism', 'clash', 'Selznick', 'expectations', 'film', 'Selznick', 'insisted', 'cinematographer', 'be', 'brought', 'film', 'Montgomery', 'Clift', 'Jennifer', 'close-ups', 'would', 'appear', 'more', 'glamorous', 'film', 'was', 'completed', 'Selznick', 'edited', '90', 'minute', 'film', 'down', '63', 'minutes', 'U.S.', 'release', 'retitled', 'Indiscretion', 'American', 'Wife', 'versions', 'failed', 'box', 'office', 'critics', 'film', 'looked', 'wonderful', 'camera-work', 'was', 'stunning', 'especially', 'close-ups', 'Jones', 'Clift', 'problem', 'film', 'basically', 'lay', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'much', 'story', 'told', 'real', 'time', 'farewell', 'Philadelphia', 'house-wife', 'Italian', 'lover', 'De', 'Sica', 'additions', 'minor', 'characters', 'station', 'comic', 'relief', 'did', 'little', 'help', 'otherwise', 'flat', 'story', 'acting', 'leads', 'however', 'was', 'superior', 'chemistry', 'Jones', 'Clift', 'very', 'steamy', 'Considering', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'early', '50s', 'also', 'quite', 'frank', 'daring', 'subject', 'matter.Criterion', 'restored', 'versions', 'film', 'dvd', 'have', 'done', 'spectacular', 'job', 'commentary', 'Leonard', 'Leff', 'very', 'informative', 'covers', 'everything', 'colorful', 'troubled', 'production', 'history', 'interesting', 'tidbits', 'Jones', 'Clift', 'acting', 'styles', 'personal', 'lives', 'gallery', 'film', 'ads', 'posters', 'included', 'dvd', 'would', 'especially', 'be', 'helpful', 'film', 'students', 'who', 'want', 'study', 'styles', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'film-makers']",N/A

I would rather have the one by Anne Archer.Unhappy customer!!!!",1,Unhappy,1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,352,"['have', 'email', 'owner', 'product', 'success', 'made', 'clear', 'want', 'Indiscretion', 'American', 'Wife', 'Anne', 'Archer', 'not', 'Jennifer', 'Jones', 'person', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'then', 'he/she', 'should', 'have', 'said', 'so', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'profit', 'Not', 'good', 'movie', 'Jennifer', 'would', 'rather', 'have', 'one', 'Anne', 'Archer.Unhappy', 'customer']",N/A
