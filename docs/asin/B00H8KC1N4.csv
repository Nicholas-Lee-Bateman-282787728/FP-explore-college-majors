They were the Beverly Hillbillies, Petticoat Junction, Green Acres, and Mayberry RFD.  Even though these shows were high in the ratings, CBS wanted a more modern variety of shows.Mayberry RFD has an easy down home theme where everybody is helpful in this small town, and everyone usually works in harmony with everyone else.  In this show, controversy is kept very low key, if any at all.  With the offerings of the Hollywood today, and the TV industry, Mayberry RFD is a welcome look into the past of a gentle, quality TV show of days gone by.

1686242,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,B00H8KC1N4,J. Hill,"[17, 18]","Even though I grew up watching ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" my local stations didn't carry ""Mayberry R.F.D.,"" so I really didn't know much about it until this DVD set.  I read some reviews, and even though not all were positive, I still knew it was something I needed to have as a dedicated fan of Andy Griffith.  Now that I've watched it, I couldn't be happier with it.  For one, Andy shows up far more than I expected from what I'd read about the show.  While he's not the focus of the episodes he's in, he turns up in just about every other show, often in several scenes.  His frequent presence makes for a very easy transition into this spin-off.  Along with Andy, all of the characters from the final season of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" appear, most as regulars, including Aunt Bee, Goober, Clara Edwards, Howard Sprague, Emmett, Millie Swanson, and of course Sam Jones and his son Mike, who are now the main characters.  Helen Crump, Opie, and even Barney Fife show up in the first episode, ""Andy and Helen Get Married.""  For this occasion alone, most longime fans will want to have this set.  Besides all these characters, many other familiar faces are here, from occasional characters like Reverend Tucker, Arnold, and Cyrus to many extras who appeared repeatedly on ""The Andy Griffith Show.""  I also like what this show does with several other child actors, who make the show fun in the way some of the early ""Andy"" episodes were when Ron Howard was a little boy.I think a lot of these episodes are funnier than many color episodes of ""Andy,"" while others have a less comedic tone.  ""Mayberry R.F.D."" sometimes has a lighthearted family drama sort of tone rather than being a silly comedy all of the time.  That seems to cause some to criticize the show for its lack of punchlines, but I like the charm of presenting simple, downhome stories that don't always need to portray some goofball situation, like Aunt Bee wearing a wig to impress a visiting reverend, or Andy eating three spaghetti dinners in one evening.  I don't know if this show went downhill in the next seasons, but I've been watching ""Season 1"" nonstop since I got it.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes ""The Andy Griffith Show"" enough to appreciate even the color episodes.

This is a great cast with most of the 1967 Andy Griffith Show performers returning (Aunt Bee, Clara, Goober, Howard, Emmett and Millie- the latter was a late entry on TAGS),  The muti-talented, dancer/ actor Ken Berry is at the helm as Town Councilman/ farmer Sam Jones. I honestly don't think any other actor could have done so well stepping into this beloved series; Berry is warm, humorous and affectionate with his son, Mike (Buddy Foster), Aunt Bee (Francis Bavier), & love interest Millie (Arlene Golonka). I love the character Howard Sprague, as he continues in his TAGS role as the socially repressed county clerk. And of course, there is Goober and Emmett. Good-hearted Goober has the mentality of a 12 year old, and fix-it man Emmett repairs everything by slaming or jarring it. Episode one has Andy's wedding.
