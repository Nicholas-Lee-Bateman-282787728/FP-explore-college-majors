306958,AJYILFULOQ3CX,6302309522,a man from the east coast,"[7, 8]","(Warning:  Contains plot spoilers, but if you haven't seen this film, read this review anyway.  You'll be convinced that this movie is a film you should see.)I remember, back in 1991, when I was sitting in a theatre, watching as the end credits rolled, thinking to myself:  ""This film is going to be a huge hit, and it'll go on to be a classic.""Well, it wasn't much of a financial success; after about a month, it was gone from the theatres.  To the best of my knowledge, neither Roger Ebert nor any other critic of note thinks of this film as a classic.Funny thing is, everyone I've ever showed this film to, especially those of the feminine persuasion, has been entralled by this film.Go figure.Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as Willard in this role; he plays something of a noble innocent, much like he does in ""TLOTR"" trilogy.  His best buddy, enacted by a very spunky, outspoken Thora Birch, wins over the audience almost instantly, as we come to know her as a very intelligent and kind-hearted young lady.  And yet Miss Birch never steals the spotlight from Elijah; even back then, she was such a good actress that she could play her part most effectively and still not step on the other actor's toes.That brings us to the adults; Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith play Ben and Lily Reed, a couple in the aftermath of their son's accidental death.  Ben is a man trying to reach out to his wife, while his wife Lily  punishes herself by refusing any comfort her husband may be able to offer.Don Johnson very much does NOT play Sonny Crockett  here.  There's none of Crockett's cockiness, nor is he a jaded man-of-the-world like Nash Bridges.  ""Ben"" is a shrimp boat captain, estranged from his wife after the accidental death of their son; he's a good-natured man eternally in a foul humor.  And yet he is harboring hope that somehow, a way forward, beyond trajedy, shall be found.Melanie Griffith plays her part more quietly and more subtly than anything else I've ever seen from her; her portrayal of Lily as a woman of great emotional depth who is, at the same time, very much someone you'd converse at the local coffee shop; she seems to be everyone's friend, yet she is alone in her suffering.Enter Willard; both adults form a deep bond with him, which stands in stark contrast to the gulf that exists between themselves.  This bond that Ben and Lily form with Willard, both individually and together, helps them to draw a bit closer to one another, and to begin to confront the pain that is tearing their home, and their marriage, apart.  The issue confronting each of these three is courage; Elijah must find the courage to face issues in his life back home, and Ben and Lily have to find the courage to face the pain that is destroying so much of their lives.The great thing about this film is that, in the end, all loose ends are NOT tied up.  There's issues in Elijah's life he still must face, but he leaves Ben and Lily with a better understanding of who he is, and what sort of courage lies within him.  As you'll see in the film's conclusion, things are not ""all fine and dandy"" for Thora Birch's character either; and Ben and Lily, whilst having found one another again, still have a life to try to rebuild.And that's the point:  There are no perfect fixes, and things don't always end happily, if they ever find their conclusion at all.  The point here is that sometimes we meet people who help us to better know who we are, and that we have what it takes to face the things that scare us.  Victory, of course, is still quite uncertain, but at least we have the courage to stand, rather than run.  That, by itself, says something.So why wasn't this wonderful film more successful?My theory is that this just isn't the project that folks were expecting from Sonny Crockett teaming up with his wife, Tess McGill.  People just were NOT expecting this film, especially not from these two, and taking too much of a hard turn can turn you right over.  Perhaps that's what happened here.This is a film that shall always be in my DVD collection; I can't imagine a film library that didn't include this movie.  It's great for family viewing, and it's also something of an educational film to show teens, as it is demonstrative of how to cope with unimaginable trajedy.  The characters don't pretend to be perfect, there's no ""now everything will be o.k."" ending, and all loose ends aren't tied up.  Yet this film does have something important to say, and it is something many people would do well to hear.Perhaps if this film came out today, in 2010, rather than in 1991, it might find a bigger audience.  Granted, it would be promoted almost exclusively to women, but if a girlfriend dragged her man to see this, he'd most likely leave the theatre saying the following in a rather surprised, unsettled tone: ""You know ... that was a really was a good movie.""This film came out at the wrong time, and tried to find an audience amoungst those who were expecting something much different.  Perhaps that's why it never got a fair shake, but watch it anyway; you'll never forget it, and it will find a place to reside in your heart, as great films always do.",4,This has to be the most

This movie is about life in a small town which is different from big budget movies about living in places like Los Angeles. I relate to this movie as well and it has a great love story. Nobody wants to see a boring story about things that always go right. BOOOOOORING! when you live in a small town and you're a young kid, your main concern is finding things to do. You don't always find the most POLITICALLY CORRECT things to do, you do whatever is fun. Whether it be getting into some trouble, or rebelling or whatever. I can relate to peeping on people, and just wanting to be out of the house all summer long. Maybe that's why I like this movie so much. I live in Northern Ontario on the border of Ontario and Michigan, and I heard somewhere that this movie was filmed in Paradise, Michigan. Don Johnson's character even talks about meeting his wife in Brimley, which is in Michigan and I've been there. It's a pretty nice place. I find that when you can relate to a movie, or have been to the city that it's filmed in, it makes it a lot more fun to watch.I give the movie a 5, I'd give it more if I could.

Like the other reviewers before me, it's a collectors keepsake if you like that nostalgic, non-violent, feel good kind of real family, real deal, heart wrenching drama type of genres. For some reason reminds me alot of 'Hearts In Atlantis' or 'The War', in that sense of non-traditional, non epic film making, that comes along every once in awhile to titilate our senses. Mary Agnes Donoghue (who also wrote the screenplay, if I am not mistaken, to 2002's White Oleander) directs.Lily and Ben Reed, names I have remembered since I saw this with my brother when I was 11, have stayed with me for years. At the time, Don and Melanie were married, and they put so much emotion into their roles as parents who lost a young child, and having Willard (what an awful name) played by Elijah Wood stay with them for the summer, and watching Melanie and Don interact with him, as if he were their own son, watching him grow and learn, is truly gut wrenching and I must say kudos galore to M.Agnes D., for letting them both go with their emotions in those scenes. Watching Melanie put Willard to sleep in one scene, and her stroking his hair and watching him, I mean I was shell shocked, that pain a mother must go through to lose a son, and then having to take care of another's son and see what your boy might have looked like, what they might have smelt like, and what their hair might have been like...well that truly was very tear-jerking stuff. Truly spectacular acting, which I almost want to cringe with respect to saying that to Donnie Boy lol.Heart felt performances, really beautiful morning cinematography, whisping Southern stereotypes done extremely well, and beautiful imagery in many aspects from the tower climbing to the wilderness; and really worth a look, and one of, if not the first roles for Elijah, right after 'Avalon' perhaps?No need to rent this one, def. worth the purchase price.

""Lovely"" is a good description of Don Johnson, one of the great male beauties in American cinema. His sheer presence is such that one cannot help but root for him. Admittedly, Johnson was an even prettier man, so fresh-faced and svelt, in his twenties, when he did such frisky (and sometimes even nakedly exhibitionistic roles; in his case, ""Strip, Don, take it all off!"") in films of his twenty-something youth like ""The Harrad Experiment"" (the uncensored original), ""Return to Macon County"", ""A Boy and His Dog"", and other films of that time of his life. Even by the time of ""Miami Vice"", for TV, he still was strikingly beautiful, though not quite so much so as earlier.Don Johnson, the sweet-looking (as well as salty and quirky) young dude from Missouri, certainly looks great in ""Paradise"" with his wife of that time co-starring with him. I originally wrote the essence of these comments to attach to someone else's review, but decided to recast them for a brief review of my own, more to do a Quebecker's homage to Don Johnson than to describe ""Paradise"" itself in detail (which other reviews have done quite adequately), since Don Johnson is one of my favourite American actors. (Incidentally, Don Johnson was a superbly gifted singer, as well, as his recordings and YouTube vocals demonstrate.)Anyway, any film with Don Johnson in his twenties or thirties is worth watching! His physical radience still shines through in ""Paradise"". With such looks, he could have succeeded as a lesser actor, but, in fact, Don Johnson's acting is always engaging and expert. In ""Paradise"" he has a role of substance as well, as always, of charm, and Do Johnson excels in it!",5,The beateous Don Johnson Excels in a Role of Dramatic Substance,1303516800,"04 23, 2011",2011,1737,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'least', 'early', 'mid-career', 'films', 'Lovely', 'good', 'description', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'one', 'great', 'male', 'beauties', 'American', 'cinema', 'sheer', 'presence', 'such', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'root', 'Admittedly', 'Johnson', 'was', 'even', 'prettier', 'man', 'fresh-faced', 'svelt', 'twenties', 'when', 'did', 'such', 'frisky', 'sometimes', 'even', 'nakedly', 'exhibitionistic', 'roles', 'case', 'Strip', 'Don', 'take', 'off', 'films', 'twenty-something', 'youth', 'Harrad', 'Experiment', 'uncensored', 'original', 'Return', 'Macon', 'County', 'Boy', 'Dog', 'other', 'films', 'time', 'life', 'Even', 'time', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'TV', 'still', 'was', 'strikingly', 'beautiful', 'not', 'quite', 'so', 'much', 'earlier.Don', 'Johnson', 'sweet-looking', 'as', 'well', 'salty', 'quirky', 'young', 'dude', 'Missouri', 'certainly', 'great', 'Paradise', 'wife', 'time', 'co-starring', 'originally', 'wrote', 'essence', 'comments', 'attach', 'someone', 'else', 'review', 'decided', 'recast', 'brief', 'review', 'own', 'more', 'do', 'Quebecker', 'homage', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'describe', 'Paradise', 'detail', 'other', 'reviews', 'have', 'done', 'quite', 'adequately', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'one', 'favourite', 'American', 'actors', 'Incidentally', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'was', 'superbly', 'gifted', 'singer', 'as', 'well', 'recordings', 'YouTube', 'vocals', 'demonstrate', 'Anyway', 'film', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'twenties', 'thirties', 'worth', 'watching', 'physical', 'radience', 'still', 'Paradise', 'such', 'looks', 'could', 'have', 'succeeded', 'lesser', 'actor', 'fact', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'acting', 'always', 'engaging', 'expert', 'Paradise', 'role', 'substance', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'charm', 'Do', 'Johnson', 'excels']",Paradise VHS

Polhemus ""Book Collector""","[7, 10]","A simple, old-time movie about the simple life in a small town does not change the fact that grief and estrangement are universal and cannot be ignored as if they will tippy-toe away. Secrets gnaw from the inside out.Ben and Lily (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) lost a young son two years earlier, so when Willard (Elijah Wood) arrives, he steps right into this scenario of estrangement and unresolved grief.Ten-year-old Willard has come to visit because his pregnant mother wrestles with her own potential loss--Willard's father has run off with another woman--and she needs time to figure out what to do.  Willard's father becomes a pivotal point later in the story. Willard is sent to Lily because she was his mother's best friend in their girlhood days.A bright boy, Willard senses that things are not well in this house. He makes friends with Billie, the wild girl next-door, nine-years-old and daughter of the town floozie, making this viewer ask, as always, why children must also suffer the problems of their parents.Yes, Paradise, is an apt name for a perfect setting--fishing, swimming, warm summer days, tree rafts, boating. But, of course, it is not paradise. What then is this story about, if not an idyllic setting? It is about the daily-ness of life and how each little act leads to the next for good or bad, in the case of unresolved grief, out of avoidance, out of ignorance, out of now a set routine. That's where Willard's role is apparent. His presence presents a new paradigm, breaking the unhappy flow of energy. Not that he does this intentionally--he doesn't. He simply is a new factor to alter their energy, refocusing it back into this couple, who are so hopelessly lost in their grief.""Paradise"" is a quiet drama, a family drama, and one that ends well.",5,"In Paradise, indeed...",1199491200,"01 5, 2008",2008,1783,"['simple', 'old-time', 'movie', 'simple', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'not', 'change', 'fact', 'grief', 'estrangement', 'are', 'universal', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'will', 'tippy-toe', 'away', 'Secrets', 'gnaw', 'inside', 'out.Ben', 'Lily', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'lost', 'young', 'son', 'two', 'years', 'earlier', 'so', 'when', 'Willard', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'right', 'scenario', 'estrangement', 'unresolved', 'grief.Ten-year-old', 'Willard', 'come', 'visit', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'wrestles', 'own', 'potential', 'loss', 'Willard', 'father', 'run', 'off', 'woman', 'time', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'do', 'Willard', 'father', 'pivotal', 'point', 'later', 'story', 'Willard', 'sent', 'Lily', 'was', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'girlhood', 'days.A', 'bright', 'boy', 'Willard', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'well', 'house', 'friends', 'Billie', 'wild', 'girl', 'next-door', 'nine-years-old', 'daughter', 'town', 'floozie', 'making', 'viewer', 'ask', 'always', 'why', 'children', 'must', 'also', 'suffer', 'problems', 'parents.Yes', 'Paradise', 'apt', 'name', 'perfect', 'setting', 'fishing', 'swimming', 'warm', 'summer', 'days', 'tree', 'rafts', 'boating', 'course', 'not', 'paradise', 'What', 'then', 'story', 'not', 'idyllic', 'setting', 'daily-ness', 'life', 'how', 'little', 'act', 'next', 'good', 'bad', 'case', 'unresolved', 'grief', 'avoidance', 'ignorance', 'now', 'set', 'routine', 'where', 'Willard', 'role', 'apparent', 'presence', 'new', 'paradigm', 'breaking', 'unhappy', 'flow', 'energy', 'Not', 'intentionally', ""n't"", 'simply', 'new', 'factor', 'alter', 'energy', 'refocusing', 'back', 'couple', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'grief', 'Paradise', 'quiet', 'drama', 'family', 'drama', 'one', 'well']",Paradise VHS

Johnson was a cold heartless man who hid his pain in anger and Griffith was a kind nurturing woman who hid it in the attic. I felt very much for the couple in the movie at age 10 and even more at 24.The fact that Wood and Burch bonded and shared alot was not that much different from Culkin and Chlumsky's relataionship in My Girl. They were young curious opposite sex friends who were probably closer than most of the adults around them at the time.I loved this movie and still do til this day. At age 10 i wanted to watch it all the time and i must've seen it at least 20 times over the years. If you haven't seen it i would recomend it. If you liked My Girl this movie is a movie for you.

306979,A3O536E2YOKK4Y,6302309522,Wuchak,"[0, 0]","The first half of 1991's &#34;Paradise&#34; is great. It's essentially a coming-of-age story of two 9 year-olds (Elijah Wood and Thora Birch) on the Atlantic coast near Chrarleston, SC (shot on location). The locations are breathtaking and illustrate that every area has its unique beauty. The film's also about a couple who Elijah is visiting for the Summer (Birch's character is a neighbor). The couple (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) are on the verge of divorce due to a tragedy a few years earlier. Wood's visit is instrumental in reviving them as individuals and as a couple.The first half is so well done that I thought I stumbled upon a hidden gem but, unfortunately, the second half falls into mediocrity. The awkward and contrived scenes with questionable acting/dialogue could've worked if the filmmakers simply worked out the kinks through rewriting, reshooting, better editing, etc. but it's clear that they had to finish the picture on a limited budget. They got the job done, and that's great, but if they spent a little more time, a little more money and tried a little harder they could've had a near masterpiece.This is the only movie that I can remember where Don Johnson plays a major protagonist (I've never seen Miami Vice) and it shows that he should've been a major ultra-cool masculine actor, like Clint Eastwood, Thomas Jane, Charles Bronson and a gazillion others.Sarah Trigger plays Birch's hot half-sister, but she's barely seen, which is a shame because she's so beautiful. They probably cut some of her scenes out. If you don't remember her, she played Steve Martin's redhead babe in &#34;Grand Canyon.&#34;BOTTOM LINE: This coming of age film has numerous great moments, particularly in the first half -- moments of wonder, beauty, discovery and companionship. It's too bad they drop the ball in the second half. Regardless, it's a very worthwhile movie and Johnson shows his greatness. Like the movie, he coulda been a contenda.The film runs 111 minutes.GRADE: B",4,Coulda been a contenda,1402099200,"06 7, 2014",2014,1997,"['first', 'half', '1991', '34', 'Paradise', '34', 'great', 'essentially', 'coming-of-age', 'story', 'two', '9', 'year-olds', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'Atlantic', 'coast', 'Chrarleston', 'SC', 'shot', 'location', 'locations', 'are', 'breathtaking', 'illustrate', 'area', 'unique', 'beauty', 'film', 'also', 'couple', 'who', 'Elijah', 'visiting', 'Summer', 'Birch', 'character', 'neighbor', 'couple', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'are', 'verge', 'divorce', 'due', 'tragedy', 'few', 'years', 'earlier', 'Wood', 'visit', 'instrumental', 'reviving', 'individuals', 'couple.The', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'thought', 'stumbled', 'hidden', 'gem', 'unfortunately', 'second', 'half', 'mediocrity', 'awkward', 'contrived', 'scenes', 'questionable', 'acting/dialogue', 'could', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'filmmakers', 'simply', 'worked', 'out', 'kinks', 'rewriting', 'reshooting', 'better', 'editing', 'etc', 'clear', 'had', 'finish', 'picture', 'limited', 'budget', 'got', 'job', 'done', 'great', 'spent', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'little', 'more', 'money', 'tried', 'little', 'harder', 'could', ""'ve"", 'had', 'near', 'masterpiece.This', 'only', 'movie', 'can', 'remember', 'where', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'major', 'protagonist', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'major', 'ultra-cool', 'masculine', 'actor', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Charles', 'Bronson', 'gazillion', 'others.Sarah', 'Trigger', 'Birch', 'hot', 'half-sister', 'barely', 'seen', 'shame', 'so', 'beautiful', 'probably', 'cut', 'scenes', 'out', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'played', 'Steve', 'Martin', 'redhead', 'babe', '34', 'Grand', 'Canyon.', '34', 'BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'numerous', 'great', 'moments', 'particularly', 'first', 'half', 'moments', 'wonder', 'beauty', 'discovery', 'companionship', 'too', 'bad', 'drop', 'ball', 'second', 'half', 'Regardless', 'very', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'Johnson', 'greatness', 'movie', 'coulda', 'been', 'contenda.The', 'film', '111', 'minutes.GRADE', 'B']",Paradise VHS
