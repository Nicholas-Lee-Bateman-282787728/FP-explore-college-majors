1354757,A35XG6755DWOJV,B003NE8B4M,"albionphoto ""albion""","[0, 0]",I have had some bad anime picks recently and so my expectations for this series were mixed. The first few episodes are a bit silly as the characters establish themselves. The absurdity of having a trigger happy veteran sergeant be a schoolboy body guard takes a while to wear off but does have some funny moments. Once the plot gets going it swings along mixing good characterization with a variety of action. It manages to be fun and suspenseful without falling prey to mindless fan service. Treat the first two or three episodes with skepticism and then be prepared to enjoy a well thought out consistent anime. Highly recommended.,5,Action and charm and a proper villain,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",2013,633,"['have', 'had', 'bad', 'anime', 'picks', 'recently', 'so', 'expectations', 'series', 'were', 'mixed', 'first', 'few', 'episodes', 'are', 'bit', 'silly', 'characters', 'establish', 'absurdity', 'having', 'trigger', 'happy', 'veteran', 'sergeant', 'be', 'schoolboy', 'body', 'guard', 'while', 'wear', 'off', 'have', 'funny', 'moments', 'plot', 'going', 'swings', 'mixing', 'good', 'characterization', 'variety', 'action', 'be', 'fun', 'suspenseful', 'falling', 'prey', 'mindless', 'fan', 'service', 'Treat', 'first', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'skepticism', 'then', 'be', 'prepared', 'enjoy', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'consistent', 'anime', 'Highly', 'recommended']",Full Metal Panic!

It didn't honestly satisfy my hunger for a good solid action anime though.  The show itself is just fine, and I would reccommend it to most people, but I've never been into the 'Mecha' fighting style.  If you are, then this will be perfect for you.  Now, let me clarify that this is a review of the show, and not of the Blu-Ray disc, format, or packaging (though they seemed all just fine to me anyway!).  I didn't really connect with Sousuke, which was a problem.  You have to be able to connect with the main character.  Though, I sure did really start to enjoy Mr. Sagara in 'FMP? Fumoffu'. My god, that's good anime.  FMP! is a good anime, and worth the buy, but I truly believe you should just watch FMP! so you know the characters for FMP? Fomoffu.

1354765,A275CBNRP5RG1I,B003NE8B4M,HiroNotHero,"[3, 4]","Here it is, the first series out of three in the Full Metal Panic anime franchise in full HD! Witness how Sousuke Sagara and Kaname Chidori first met and how the action and humorous hijinks ensues(and continues on). The insane, off the wall comedy will at times have you literally almost rolling on the group and the intense Mecha action and drama on the battlefield will hit home. Anyway, on with the review.Video:Although this is a blu-ray remastered release, oddly it's in 4x3, full screen aspect ratio instead of the usual 16x9, widescreen aspect ratio used in high definition media. This means you have to manually configure your TV's aspect ratio to widescreen(16x9) if you want to get rid of the black bars on the left and right sides of the screen, if your TV or blu-ray player doesn't do this automatically. I really don't see why they did this for the blu-ray release. Maybe they couldn't get the rights to the full HD remaster of the series. Who know. Anyhow, aside from that, the video quality is really good. The colors are vibrant, the outlines on the characters, mecha, and etc are very sharp. You don't get any kind of blurry, hazy, or distorted parts whatsoever in any of the episodes.Audio:The HD audio remastering of this version is really good like a lot of blu-ray conversions of once DVD only material. The music is more powerful and clear, the sound effects are more powerful and crisp. Also, the quality of the character's voices was a lot clearer and more dynamic. These are to expected from blu-ray audio, though. The better your audio set up for your TV is, the closer you get to the ""theater-like"" sound experience.Story:Well, what can I say? It's over the top comedy fused with Mecha action and drama. You get a little bit of everything in this show. Scenes where you will laugh really hard, scenes where you will be gripping the edge of your seat/chair/couch/etc, scenes where you will feel the pain the characters are feeling, and scenes where you will feel warm and fuzzy inside. A very brilliant story, indeed. It has enough mechs and action to drawn in the mecha/action anime fans, enough comedy and romance to attract the comedy and romantic comedy anime fans, and enough gripping drama to lure the drama and ""thought provoking"" anime fans. A hardcore warrior-minded mercenary boy clueless to the ways of normal, every day civilian life meets violent, tomboy-ish (somewhat)normal civilian girl clueless to the ways of life on the battlefield was never portrayed as well as this.

Fumoffu is for you, not much action in that series.The animation is great for having been produced in 2002, especially compared to shows being produced at the time With that let me discuss the reason for the title above, while the english dub sounds good and no actor is bad, I personally felt that Sousuke's personality and the fact that he is oblivious to everything he is doing wrong is lost with the english dub. Even with the Japanese audio being in stereo I would say stick with that, but if you dislike reading subtitles then the english audio is perfectly fine.I really enjoy when a show or anime can blend together multiple genres and make a successful final product, the only genre that ends up lacking a little bit is the romance but that is a result of the characters personalities and interactions aka Sousuke is again oblivious to everything not military related.Rating: 4.5/5",5,Language Matters,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,1390,"['anime', 'great', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'mech', 'anime', 'side', 'comedy', 'fish', 'water', 'story', 'where', 'mercenary', 'Sousuke', 'who', '16-17', 'years', 'old', 'join', 'school', 'Tokyo', 'watch', 'girl', 'named', 'Kaname', 'whispered', 'abilities', 'good', 'action', 'comedy', 'story', 'place', 'season', 'more', 'action', 'side', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'great', 'show.If', 'are', 'comedic', 'aspects', 'then', 'watching', 'purchasing', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'Fumoffu', 'not', 'much', 'action', 'series.The', 'animation', 'great', 'having', 'been', 'produced', '2002', 'especially', 'compared', 'shows', 'being', 'produced', 'time', 'let', 'discuss', 'reason', 'title', 'english', 'dub', 'sounds', 'good', 'actor', 'bad', 'personally', 'felt', 'Sousuke', 'personality', 'fact', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'doing', 'wrong', 'lost', 'english', 'dub', 'Even', 'Japanese', 'audio', 'being', 'stereo', 'would', 'say', 'stick', 'dislike', 'reading', 'subtitles', 'then', 'english', 'audio', 'perfectly', 'fine.I', 'really', 'enjoy', 'when', 'show', 'anime', 'can', 'blend', 'together', 'multiple', 'genres', 'make', 'successful', 'final', 'product', 'only', 'genre', 'up', 'lacking', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'result', 'characters', 'personalities', 'interactions', 'aka', 'Sousuke', 'again', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'not', 'military', 'related.Rating', '4.5/5']",Full Metal Panic!

1354773,A2551AOGTAT81S,B003NE8B4M,Mike J.,"[8, 35]","**(CONTAIN SPOILERS)**This series has an interesting concept and starts promisingly. It follows the story of a 17-year-old Sergeant Sousuke Sagara who works for an anti-terrorist military group called Mithril and is assigned to protect another 17-year-old, the most popular girl in high school, Kaname from some unknown dangers (Later we will understand why and who is targeting her). The funny part is our hero Sousuke was raised in the military, and despite of being an excellent soldier, he has absolutely no social skills.  In order to secretly protect Kaname from danger, Sousuke takes on an undercover mission by enrolling to Kaname's high school, you can probably figure out the rest by yourself, he then overreacts every little thing at school and creates all sorts of comedic absurdity, misunderstandings and troubles for the whole class, teacher and of course the hot-headed Kaname who especially can't stand his lack of common sense, later gradually develops a feeling for him.That is the general introduction to the first several episodes and the show reaches its peak when Kaname finally got kidnapped and Sousuke went on a dangerous battle to save her. These episodes are thrilling and done pretty well; however, after this rescue mission is over; all the bad guys have been supposedly killed and apparently there are no more enemies will chase after kaname, the fun suddenly stops. The rest of the episodes seem to go backward by following the exact same formula from the beginning again.  Sousuke goes back to become the socially-retarded undercover high school student and continue to create comedic troubles for everyone at school even though his original mission is finished and the organization (Mitril) got no evidence to suggest that kaname will be targeted again. This part really disappoints me as the creator failed to come up with different and better concepts.  The plots should've moved on and been more creative about the future storylines instead of continuing relying on the same old jokes. Sousuke is a highly skillful Sergeant who works for the anti-terrorist organization, so why can't he be assigned to do another different or more dangerous secret mission besides going back to babysit that spoiled-little princess Kaname again? It's so illogical, unconvincing and wasteful for a talented soldier like Sousuke.On top of that the creator failed to prove the connection between Kaname and the second mission, which begins from ep. 8-12. I mean why is she even needed in these episodes besides making the audience to see how she gets jealous and violent on Sousuke? The second mission doesn't even revolve around her and frankly we are forced to see more kaname's annoying temper than actions. I understand romance is part of the big concept in this series, but these episodes involved Kaname and Sousuke is neither romantic nor sensible. I guess its purpose is to create some childish comedic relief but let's be honest, haven't we seen enough jokes like this in the beginning episodes already?Furthermore, I find it hard to believe Sousuke, a skillful soldier who is capable of mastering all sort of highly-advanced technologies yet has a hard time adapting to normal life. The jokes about him being the most clueless guy in the world are quite refreshing in the beginning, but his character never grows throughout the whole series, which is quite disappointing. Even a 5-year-old is able to learn a few things about life after his/her parents teach him/her; but Sousuke never learns and acts exactly like the same way from before in the end.Lastly, the character Tessa has to be the most annoying one in the show. She is the 16-year-old Captain of Mithril, yet couldn't hold a gun to defend herself to save her own life. She's childish, prudish, over-polite, pacific and lacks of confidence. Although I have some problems with concepts like a teen leading a bunch of grow-ups in a military organization (I just don't buy it), my biggest problem is that the creator couldn't give us a convincing answer how could someone so weak could take up the position of the captain of the anti-terrorist organization. To me this position doesn't suit her one bit, but the creator tried too hard to prove she worths it, which shows in the filler episode (13) where a silly argument breaks out between she and Mellisa Mao, who then challenges her to an AS duel. The outcome proved to be less satisfactory and unconvincing rather than Tessa is a big crybaby.The music and graphics score very high in this series. The opening and closing songs are very catchy and the drawings are quite beautiful, detailed and fluids. But that's about it.All in all, although this series doesn't impress me much in many ways, I would still recommend this one to anyone who enjoys mecha, romance and slapstick comedy. However, I would not recommend it to anyone who ages under 12 since it contains moderate violence, mild profanity and some brief nudity. Make sure you watch a few episodes online before purchasing it.",2,"Juvenile, Juvenile",1283472000,"09 3, 2010",2010,5021,"['**', 'CONTAIN', 'SPOILERS', '**This', 'series', 'interesting', 'concept',

Unfortunately, while very knowledgeable of military subjects, Sousuke completely lacks basic social skills. Also working against him is the very thing that makes him a good soldier, a healthy paranoia and quick reflexes, which results in many a innocent student at gunpoint. While Sousuke is intent on guarding Kaname from terrorists, she works hard to protect the school from Sousuke!I started this series without any expectations, and I must say I was quiet pleasantly surprised. Sousuke is quiet an ernest, likable character and Kaname isn't as annoying as I had expected her. Over time I even grew rather fond of her. Sousuke's social inaptitude is the focus of most of the humor, but wasn't too overdone. He does seem incredible dense sometime, but you have to keep in mind the environment that he was raised in, and take into account that he doesn't really care about social correctness and doesn't make much of an effort to learn. The balance between military missions and high school social life is well done and provide an entertaining contrast.I tried watching this show in English for an episode and then gave up and switched to Japanese, which was much better. Sousuke's voice actor in particular did a very good job. The English dub isn't too bad, the Japanese is just much better.If you enjoy this show you will be please to learn that the two OVAs are even better.Full Metal Panic FUMOFFUis 12 episodes of random short stories andFull Metal Panic!

The set comes in four dvds put into two thinpack dvd case and into paper sleeve like the recent Funimation box sets,  and while it cuts from the previous set of seven dvds the video quality is still the same.  That would be the biggest desicion for myself as I was wondering about the possibility of any video difference or not,  and there isn't though the frame rate runs smoother so the video looks a little clearer and with fewer miniscule frame distortions but nothing majorly different from the earlier released sets.  The one thing that has vastly improved though is the much more clearer audio soundtrack,  unlike the previous set a few years ago this one only has 5.1 English audio or 2.0 Japanese audio as Funimation like with the re-release of Kiddy Grade have tossed away the old 2.0 English audio.  Also I haven't check all the old series release set dvds yet but it looks Like Funimation touched up the subtitles of this newest release to translate and fit what the subbed cast are saying a lot more better which is nice,  also there are pretty much the same we had with the earlier sets with the t.v. promotional spots,  trailers,  and textless intro/ending songs.  If you already have the earlier boxed sets I would say just stick with those unless you need to replace a disc or two,  overall with the exception of a cleaner and clearer audio and fewer disc overall you won't see a major difference between this set and the set that was released a few years ago..The series itself is very entertaining for any mecha or action anime fan as you'll get a good dose of both,  the short basic storyline is you have people called ""Whispered"" who have innate knowledge of advanced sciences ranging from medical to weapons design and because of this there are a variety of groups who are seeking these unique individuals for their own shadowy agendas.  One of these whispered is our main female character a spunky young japanese High school girl Kaname Chidori who is being targeted by two groups one of which our main male character Sousuke Sagara a young teenage boy and very skilled mercenary fighter is with is chosen to protect her from these nefarious people.  The characters grow on you and the other cast members are all endearing in their own little way as well.  The voice cast were great in their roles both the Japanese and English cast played their roles very well and the soundtrack fits the series too.

1354777,A3A4ZAIBQWKOZS,B003NE8B4M,Stephen M. Lerch,"[101, 104]","I just received this set and have watched through roughly 4 episodes and a little bit.For those that don't know, Full Metal Panic (or FMP) is a show from early 2000 based on a series of short novels. The story involves a boy soldier (well, mercenary), sent by a secret organization to protect a girl who is known to be a ""Whispered."" Being a ""Whispered"" means that the person holds knowledge of ""black technology"" without really knowing they know it. Mostly it's about Sagara Sosuke, the boy soldier, being clumsy with people and having an obvious crush on the girl he is supposed to be protecting. The feeling is mutual and the girl he is protecting, Chidori Kaname, is just as awkward in dealing with Sosuke.Giant robot action is also included as a sort of bonus. Think of the show as a romantic comedy with serious drama and military action thrown in.In terms of the Blu Ray, this release is an upscale of a standard definition release as the studio that animated it, Gonzo, was only animating in SD at the time of its release. Either way, a proper software upscale done on a Blu Ray will always look better than an upscale done through hardware (watching a DVD via the PS3 upscaled to 1080p for instance). This release is no exception.The nice thing here is that the opening sequence is unaffected by the upscale this time around, unlike Funimation's release ofFull Metal Panic! The Second Raid Box Set [Blu-ray] where the opening was improperly encoded and skips frames.Picture quality is nothing short of amazing. Crystal clear and from everything I can tell, there are no artifacts or other weirdness brought in from the upscale. If you had this on DVD and want an upgrade in picture quality, this is a worthy purchase as it looks perfect. If upscaled DVD looks good to you, well there may be no point in upgrading to Blu Ray.Something to keep in mind is that this show was originally done in the 4:3 aspect ratio (SD). The opening, while widescreen, isn't anamorphic and wasn't actually animated in HD, so it will always contain bars at the top and bottom of the picture. This is as it was originally animated and FUNimation has taken no liberties to try and stretch it to a widescreen format, which is appreciated.The opening and endings are the same as the ADV DVD release so the opening/ending title cards are all in English. If you're looking for the Japanese title cards, you'll need to purchase the Japanese releases to have Japanese title cards as they are not included in any ADV or FUNimation release.In terms of audio, you have 2 options. You can watch the show in Stereo Dolby True HD in spoken Japanese (the original show was 2.0 stereo in Japan, so you are getting the audio as originally intended by the Japanese producers for the Japanese market) and  you are also given the option of Dolby True HD 5.1 in spoken English. When ADV released the series oh so many years ago, they upgraded the 2.0 audio to a 5.1 mix in the US. The result in English, for me, is a mixed result as much of the time it still feels like a stereo mix. I also generally watch Anime in Japanese, so I was really just swapping around during action sequences to see how the channel separation sounds and it's good, but nothing amazing.Overall the audio sounds pretty good. There are no drop outs or other audio issues and the added bitrate afforded by Blu Ray and True HD, but then, there weren't really any issues with the original DVD mixes either.Some nice extras are included, including one that wasn't in the original single release from ADV (nor was it included in previous ADV sets). The new extra is the interview with the show's producers and original author of the novels. This was recorded for the Japanese Blu Ray release (or possibly to air during the re-airing of the series on Japanese TV, I'm not sure), I believe, so it actually is encoded in HD, 1080i. It's a look back on the show's release and is really good.There is something missing from the extras. The original DVD release included some production sketches in video form. These do not exist on this release, which means it isn't ""complete,"" however they weren't amazing. It is disappointing they aren't here though.You have 8 episodes per disc, on 3 discs. I was worried there would be audio or video issues trying to cram so many episodes on a disc, however the bit rates are high throughout and it really looks quite amazing.If you love the series and want the release with the best video quality yet released, this is the one to pick up. If you need to have all the extras, you'll need this release (or the DVD equivalent) and the original ADV release for the production sketches.If you've never seen the show and don't own a previous version, this is the one to get.EDIT- one mistake. The ending credits are NOT the same credits ADV used. They have been redone and no longer ""scroll"" up the screen, which is nice. Still would have been nice to include the original op/ed credits from the Japanese version as an extra if nothing else.",5,"Very, very nice; a review of the actual Blu Ray",1283385600,"09 2,

1354780,ABNMJKRHN0ULX,B003NE8B4M,TeamReveal,"[3, 5]","I bought this series based on positive reviews I had read including some here on Amazon but I found the series to be mediocre. I've seen Neon Genesis Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo, Samurai 7, and The Fullmetal Alchemist (First Series, not the recently remade one). These are excellent series that I thoroughly enjoyed, Evangelion and Cowboy Bebop being legendary in the anime genre.Full Metal Panic! is the first series I felt was actually mediocre and did not live up to the positive reviews I had read. It took me about 14 episodes of viewing before I felt like I was getting into it, but even after I started to care a bit about the series I didn't care a whole lot.The main problem is that the all of the characters are one-dimensional. The main characters Kaname and Sousuke do start to be developed later on but for the most part they remain one-dimensional. The main villain of the series is even worse, he is as cheesy and one-dimensional as they come. The music isn't anything to write home about either, some of it is decent and some of it is cheesy. The actual animation is the best part of the series.Overall this high school romantic/comedy/action series relies on a formula that gets old after a while. Sousuke is a military guy who approaches every part of his life as if it were a mission, which leads him into some slapstick humor. Kaname is the high school girl with beauty, charm, and smarts. The romance takes place between Sousuke and Kaname and the main villain is evil just for the sake of being evil, oh and to make some money too. That's the formula of the series and I didn't think the creators did enough with it or develop the characters enough.If you are looking for something that has some real substance then you should look elsewhere. The series I listed at the beginning are all much better than this series. If you are a hardcore anime fan and you've gone through most of the top quality anime out there then you might want to give this a shot as it's not a bad series, it's just not an exceptional series and there are many exceptional anime series out there.*edit*I just finished watching season two of this series and I was pleasantly surprised. The creators actually got around to exploring the characters themselves which I felt was missing in the first series. As someone who really enjoys anime, I will have to say that it is worth watching the first season to lead you into an excellent second season.",3,3 1/2 Stars.
