This movie, with the feel of a moronic T.V. sitcom, is simply dull as mud. I could not feel the slightest bit of rapport with anyone! It's a juvenile storyline, but not the least bit funny. One can only hope people this dopey only exist in the writer's imagination!In case anyone is wondering, the word ""Narcissistic"" means: egotistical, selfish, self-centered and that exactly describes the main character.

She does, but with a turn-the-tables of her own -- she agrees to it only if Anthony does the same with the sweet and puppyish Victor (Guillermo Diaz), who has a crush on Anthony.Sounds fun, yes?  Well... for awhile, at least, it is.  Anthony and his fire buds (including the dreamy David Lee Russek) take Victor to a gay bar on their &quot;date&quot;, and his buddies end up having a surprisingly great time.  In the meantime, Amy is testing the waters with Michelle (Jennifer Esposito), the sexy lesbian across the street.  A romping good time so far.  Unfortunately, the second half of the film gets weighed down in boring, cliche-ridden emotions... and that takes away from the films' appeal.The cast is sexy, it delivers some laughs, and handles the issue of homophobia quite nicely... but the film would have been better if it would have played up the light-heartedness, and downplayed the sap.The DVD features an originally good interactive menu with the standard extras.",3,Somewhat likeable but par for the course...,996537600,"07 31, 2001",2001,1294,"['Lane', 'Janger', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred', 'half', 'comedy/half-baked', 'drama', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'succeed.Janger', 'plays', 'Anthony', 'cute', 'NYC', 'fireman', 'who', 'week', 'impending', 'nuptials', 'Amy', 'Joelle', 'Carter', 'agree', 'fulfill', 'fantasy', 'having', 'threesome', 'woman', 'turn-the-tables', 'own', 'only', 'Anthony', 'same', 'sweet', 'puppyish', 'Victor', 'Guillermo', 'Diaz', 'who', 'crush', 'Anthony.Sounds', 'fun', 'yes', 'Well', 'awhile', 'least', 'Anthony', 'fire', 'buds', 'including', 'dreamy', 'David', 'Lee', 'Russek', 'take', 'Victor', 'gay', 'bar', 'quot', 'date', 'quot', 'buddies', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'surprisingly', 'great', 'time', 'meantime', 'Amy', 'testing', 'waters', 'Michelle', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'sexy', 'lesbian', 'street', 'romping', 'good', 'time', 'so', 'far', 'Unfortunately', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'weighed', 'down', 'boring', 'cliche-ridden', 'emotions', 'away', 'films', 'appeal.The', 'cast', 'sexy', 'laughs', 'issue', 'homophobia', 'quite', 'nicely', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'up', 'light-heartedness', 'downplayed', 'sap.The', 'DVD', 'originally', 'good', 'interactive', 'menu', 'standard', 'extras']",N/A

I think during the second ""viewing,"" I'd gotten over the sorta silly premise:  that the straight man wanted to have a tryst with his fiance and another woman prior to their wedding, and this was a sufficiently big problem for man and woman that they spend the bulk of their time, for the week or so before the wedding, trying to resolve it.This is not a gay-and-lesbian movie, per se, as the main characters are straight, but there are some important and well-sketched secondary characters that are glb and that contribute to the story in sometimes surprising ways.  There are some laughs and some decent moments here.Basically, this isn't a classic, but it is fun, and is interesting as the folks in this film try to resolve their doubts and issues (and prejudices) with each other and within themselves.Plus the production values are decent here, and the whole film is put together pretty well.

Basically a film with a lot of talk and no action.

The movie just lies there. The characters go nowhere, though are supposedly more seasoned and mature than when they started off. But the viewer is left feeling they were promised cordon bleu and ended up being served a flat pancake. The romance you wanted never quite happens, and the plot twists are never twisted enough you can't see it coming before the characters do.

Halkin ""Tim""","[13, 16]","There are times that Lane Janger (writer, director and lead of this film) looks terrific when captured at the right angle, and other times that he looks tired and ragged around the edges. The same could be said for his film.  There is potential here, and it shines through occasionally, but unfortunately not consistently.Despite the fact that the ultimate effect is cute (isn't that a terrible word to describe a film?!) and charming, I found myself scratching my head once or twice about the basic premise of this sometimes enchanting little ditty.  I guess Janger is trying to warn us that no fantasy lives up to the reality. OK...an age-old piece of wisdom...no arguments here, BUT he never REALLY lets his two lead characters experience their fantasies. They just seem to get lost and frustrated on the road leading up to it.Anthony (Janger's character) wants to see his beloved fianc&eacute;e, Amy (played by a very winning Jennifer Esposito), have sex Just One Time with another woman before they get married and HAVE to put their fantasies to bed.  That's where the first question arises: why do married couples have to stop having fantasies?  OK, small detail, let's move on...Amy does not want to grant her beloved Anthony his somewhat clich&eacute;, pubescent, masturbatory fantasy, and tries to get around the problem by one-upping him: if he has sex with a man for her, she'll give herself to a woman for him. Now pride and egos start getting in the way of anyone calling the nonsense off.  Enter Guillermo Diaz: your ... excuse for a romantic comedy's gay sidekick.  Not to say thatMr. Diaz plays his role poorly; he's actually adorable!  That said, his role is no more than a convenient plot devise: the sweet, non-threatening, virginal gay neighbor, who enters on cue, but never causes too much discomfort, either for Anthony or the viewer.  Same goes for the conveniently lesbian neighbor played by Joelle Carter, who is planted there to give Amy her brush withhomosexuality.Whereas Amy at least gets a lesbian kiss of free will out of it all, before she throw up her hands and screams, ""bring on the bands and ring the wedding bells"", Anthony stays annoyingly heterosexual. Oh, he does have a kiss, but it's aggressive and full of anger and frustration.  When he wakes up the next morning next to his token gay friend, he's horrified at the idea that something might have transpired.  Thank God, his bedmate is able to clear that fright up within 30 seconds!Actually, a rather insulting bit of tripe, but if we more emotionally self-assured and mature homosexuals are generous enough to forgive heterosexual men their occasional lapses of taste and decorum for the sake of defending their obviously fragile manhood, then you might actually enjoy the 94 minutes that this film has to offer.",3,"Ah, the Frailty of Manhood!",1025568000,"07 2, 2002",2002,2807,"['are', 'times', 'Lane', 'Janger', 'writer', 'director', 'lead', 'film', 'terrific', 'when', 'captured', 'right', 'angle', 'other', 'times', 'tired', 'ragged', 'edges', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'potential', 'here', 'occasionally', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'consistently.Despite', 'fact', 'ultimate', 'effect', 'cute', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'word', 'describe', 'film', 'charming', 'found', 'scratching', 'head', 'once', 'twice', 'basic', 'premise', 'enchanting', 'little', 'ditty', 'guess', 'Janger', 'trying', 'warn', 'fantasy', 'up', 'reality', 'age-old', 'piece', 'wisdom', 'arguments', 'here', 'BUT', 'never', 'REALLY', 'two', 'lead', 'characters', 'experience', 'fantasies', 'just', 'seem', 'get', 'lost', 'frustrated', 'road', 'leading', 'up', 'it.Anthony', 'Janger', 'character', 'see', 'beloved', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Amy', 'played', 'very', 'winning', 'Jennifer', 'Esposito', 'have', 'sex', 'Just', 'One', 'Time', 'woman', 'get', 'married', 'HAVE', 'put', 'fantasies', 'bed', 'where', 'first', 'question', 'arises', 'why', 'do', 'married', 'couples', 'have', 'stop', 'having', 'fantasies', 'OK', 'small', 'detail', 'let', 'move', 'Amy', 'not', 'want', 'grant', 'beloved', 'Anthony', 'somewhat', 'clich', 'eacute', 'pubescent', 'masturbatory', 'fantasy', 'tries', 'get', 'problem', 'one-upping', 'sex', 'man', ""'ll"", 'give', 'woman', 'Now', 'pride', 'egos', 'start', 'getting', 'way', 'anyone', 'calling', 'nonsense', 'off', 'Enter', 'Guillermo', 'Diaz', 'excuse', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'gay', 'sidekick', 'Not', 'say', 'thatMr', 'Diaz', 'role', 'poorly', 'actually', 'adorable', 'said', 'role', 'more', 'convenient', 'plot', 'devise', 'sweet', 'non-threatening', 'virginal', 'gay', 'neighbor', 'who', 'cue', 'never', 'too', 'much', 'discomfort', 'Anthony', 'viewer', 'Same', 'conveniently', 'lesbian', 'neighbor', 'played', 'Joelle', 'Carter', 'who', 'planted', 'there', 'give', 'Amy', 'brush', 'withhomosexuality.Whereas', 'Amy', 'least', 'lesbian', 'kiss', 'free', 'will', 'throw', 'up', 'hands', 'screams', 'bring', 'bands', 'ring', 'wedding', 'bells', 'Anthony', 'annoyingly', 'heterosexual', 'Oh', 'have', 'kiss', 'aggressive', 'full', 'anger', 'frustration', 'When', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'next', 'token', 'gay', 'friend', 'horrified', 'idea', 'something', 'might', 'have', 'transpired', 'Thank', 'God', 'bedmate', 'able', 'clear', 'fright', 'up', '30', 'seconds', 'Actually', 'rather', 'insulting', 'bit', 'tripe', 'more', 'emotionally', 'self-assured', 'mature', 'homosexuals', 'are', 'generous', 'enough', 'forgive', 'heterosexual', 'men', 'occasional', 'lapses', 'taste', 'decorum', 'sake', 'defending', 'obviously', 'fragile', 'manhood', 'then', 'might', 'actually', 'enjoy', '94', 'minutes', 'film', 'offer']",N/A
