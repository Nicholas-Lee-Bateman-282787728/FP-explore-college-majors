1599578,APCPKFNRS5WXV,B009NNM77E,Alex T,"[0, 0]","This movie is incredible for two reasons: it's visually unique and it's genuinely funny. Very few films like this in the past several years have delivered so many jokes in its running time, yet has never resorted to gross-out humor or jokes with adult-oriented double meanings. Not once. Parents can rest assured that they will laugh at the comedy in this movie, and not worry about being asked why a joke was so funny by a confused kid.It's a well-built animated flick all around, which makes it great to watch multiple times without getting sick of it. The creators of The Lego Movie wisely avoided focusing on a film about promoting Lego's. Instead, they thoughtfully focused on making a great film, period. No spoilers here, but the way the plot unfolds in the final one-third of the movie is proof of how much effort was put into producing a respectable work of art. Some may not buy this part of the plot, but this was a creative move that prevents the movie from feeling like a recycled animated film.While the pacing feels a little off in the later half of the movie, it definitely does not take away from what it's trying to teach. As mentioned before, parents shouldn't be concerned with any of the content, besides some cartoonish violence involving toy blocks (...yeah, it's not something that'll give your kids nightmares). With other recent animated films out there, this witty and sophisticated movie can come off as the school outcast, yet it turns out to become the coolest student in the class.

Emmet is an everyman construction worker who works for the Octan Corporation, the only company in the very conformist Legoland and whose president is the evil Lord Business (for a movie that includes a brand in its title, its tone is surprisingly anti corporate). When Emmet unexpectedly finds a piece called the Piece of Resistance (whom a Gandalf-like wizard called Vitruvius has prophesied would be found by the chosen one who would overthrow the tyranny of Lord Business), he is sought by the henchmen of Lord Business, while he is helped in his escape by the rebel girl Wildstyle. Funny and entertaining (the movie includes an extended part of a Lego Batman), surprisingly profound at times (the movie in some way is a paean to common man Emmet) and with nods to such films as The Truman Show and The Matrix. The dazzling computer animation and the intelligent script help a lot. Among the actors giving voice to the animated characters are Will Ferrell, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman.

1599588,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B009NNM77E,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 5]","So a few months back my buddies and I loaded up on alcohol, strapped on a pair of 3D glasses (ok, there were no straps) and reclined in those really comfy chairs at those new restaurant/theaters, ordered a couple pizzas and indulged in spoon-fed nostalgia.  We watched all the characters we grew up with (superheroes, sports players, generic working class citizens) explode onto the screen with hilarious disarray and put together the pieces (pun intended) of a fun little plot that found a way to mesh &#8216;Toy Story&#8217; with &#8216;The Matrix&#8217; and make it all feel fresh, fun and exciting.Seriously people, this movie was awesome!When the idea for a LEGO inspired movie was first announced, I think the world produced a collective face palm.  There are just some ideas that sound destined for failure.  Nostalgia directed films are not uncommon, and it does feel like there are swells in each decade where filmmakers think that revisiting the past is a good thing; drugging up old feelings of warmth and comfort and then modernizing them to the point where those feelings are utterly destroyed, lost forever in a black hole of celluloid embarrassment.  I was extremely skeptical that anything LEGO related would translate onto the big screen very well, namely because it wasn&#8217;t just MY nostalgia they were messing with.  LEGOS have been around for so long that EVERYONE has a nostalgic connection to them.  The oldest to the youngest, this is a point of reference for everyone, and so how do you go about making a film that makes everyone happy?Somehow, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller did just that.Well, I can only firmly attest to half of that, since I didn&#8217;t take my children, but for me this was more than I could have hoped for.  Yes, when the trailer was dropped I got excited, because it looked, well, awesome, but there was still this worry in the deepest part of my soul that they were going to royally mess this up.  Fortunately, &#8216;The LEGO Movie&#8217; works on so many levels.  While it could have easily become clunky, messy and cluttered, the film actually feels streamlined and remarkably focused despite the huge array of characters and lands.  The opening sequence does feel a tad abrupt (wait, I&#8217;m not paying attention yet) but the build on (yes, another pun) from that point forward is pretty consistent and effective.The basic story places us in a world where everything is manipulated and controlled by one man, President Business.  Everything you eat, drink, watch, listen to is all controlled by this one man.  He wants everything to be&#8230;perfect.  Unbeknownst to the common man, there is a group of freedom fighters working underground to restore free will to the people.  These people are following a prophecy about a chosen one who is destined to find a missing &#8216;piece&#8217; that will help stop the Kragle, a mysterious weapon that has found its way into President Business&#8217;s (AKA Lord Business) hands.Enter Emmet Brickowski.Emmet is your everyday laborer who enjoys overpriced coffees, watching people without pants and singing along to the only song on the radio.  He has no friends, no real good ideas and no life whatsoever outside of the small box allotted him.  When he catches a glimpse of a &#8216;babe&#8217; searching the construction site for the &#8216;piece&#8217;, he winds up falling into a world of trouble when he finds it himself, instantly becoming a hero and the hunted at the very same time.  Vitruvius, the leader of this band of freedom fighters, welcomes Emmet as the chosen one, while Lord Business and his cronies (LOL at Bad Cop/Good Cop) set off to track Emmet down, and get the piece from him.From that point forward, Emmet and the audience are thrust headfirst into a journey that takes us from LEGO land to LEGO land, introducing us to LEGO character after LEGO character, picking up strays (Batman, Unikitty, Metal Beard) and surprising us every step of the way.YES, the ending feels a bit sappy for the rest of the film (honestly, I would have loved it had it concluded with a hug and a &#8220;now, don&#8217;t touch my stuff&#8221;) but how can you fault this movie for pandering to us after giving us so much to laugh, cheer and obsess over?  Visually, this is impeccably crafted, and the voice work is also very inspired (Morgan Freeman is BRILLIANT&#8230;like, career performance brilliant, and I&#8217;m not joking) and the catchy song &#8216;Everything is Awesome&#8217; has become the theme of my life.Is it a masterpiece?

Furthermore, for children crazy about any of lego series, it's definitely a hook. In a mall where we saw the movie, a nearby toy store very ""surprisingly"" had new movie-inspired sets right on the front shelves. So parents, prepare your wallets :-) ...But here, the positives about the film are almost over. The story, about an everyman-turned-hero character Emmet, his female friend Wyldstyle and a plethora of lego-inspired characters, including the bad guy Business, who secretly runs the world under a facade of decent enterpreneur, employs a lot of cliches. For regular thinking moviegoers, the film will offer nothing basically new, it does not measure up to an average Pixar fare (Wall-E, Toy Story - although from the latter the Lego Movie seems to cite once or twice) and if you expect a lasting emotional impact, look elsewhere.For those, however, who do not expect too much, the logical ending will place the story in a satisfying perspective - indeed, there is message that children around eight years of age are unable to get yet.

I thoroughly enjoyed appearances by all kinds of pop-culture icons from Batman and Superman to Dumbledore and Gandalf.  The movie got progressively more engaging and interesting as it went along.  The voice actors were fantastic, and the whole scene was borderline unbelievable.I have to admit that my favorite scene (don't judge me) was the one where there was a flaming unicorn...also watch for the scene with a LEGO guy on the back of a LEGO horse on the back of a huge LEGO horse.What was it like when I went back a 2nd and then a 3rd time (this time we talked my wife into going too, and she had to concede that she also loved it)?  Each time I saw it I noticed new and interesting things...that IMO is a mark of a movie likely to have staying power.I look forward to adding this title to our DVD collection as soon as it's released.This movie is fun for kids of all ages...from preschoolers to 50+ yrs old.5 stars all the way!",5,Everything is awesome...when you are part of a team,1401580800,"06 1, 2014",2014,1541,"['advent', 'VHS', 'then', 'DVD', 'hardly', 'ever', 'see', 'movie', 'theater', 'more', 'once', 'knew', ""'d"", 'seen', 'one', 'three', 'times', 'OK', 'little', 'background', ""'m"", '50+', 'still', 'love', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'etc', 'kids', 'teenagers', 'older', 'were', 'raving', 'movie', 'was', 'extremely', 'hesitant', 'lay', 'down', 'cash', 'see', 'even', 'once', 'married', 'daughter', 'husband', 'HS-aged', 'daughter', 'convinced', 'go', 'see', 'wife', 'said', '34', 'bon', 'voyage', '34', 'went.I', 'went', 'extremely', 'low', 'expectations', 'movie', 'progressed', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'engaging', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'appearances', 'kinds', 'pop-culture', 'icons', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Dumbledore', 'Gandalf', 'movie', 'got', 'progressively', 'more', 'engaging', 'interesting', 'went', 'along', 'voice', 'actors', 'were', 'fantastic', 'whole', 'scene', 'was', 'borderline', 'unbelievable.I', 'have', 'admit', 'favorite', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'judge', 'was', 'one', 'where', 'was', 'flaming', 'unicorn', 'also', 'watch', 'scene', 'LEGO', 'guy', 'back', 'LEGO', 'horse', 'back', 'huge', 'LEGO', 'was', 'when', 'went', 'back', '2nd', 'then', '3rd', 'time', 'time', 'talked', 'wife', 'going', 'too', 'had', 'concede', 'also', 'loved', 'time', 'saw', 'noticed', 'new', 'interesting', 'things', 'IMO', 'mark', 'movie', 'likely', 'have', 'staying', 'power.I', 'look', 'forward', 'adding', 'title', 'DVD', 'collection', 'as', 'soon', 'released.This', 'movie', 'fun', 'kids', 'ages', 'preschoolers', '50+', 'yrs', 'old.5', 'stars', 'way']",N/A

You also receive a code to download a digital HD Ultraviolet edition from flixster.com.  I could not figure out what was contained on the discs by reading the box.  I spent an hour online trying to determine which bonus features, if any, are included on the DVD.  The bonus features were a primary reason I bought this set.Sadly, the DVD in this Awesome Edition only contains the Director/Star Commentary (abridged version of the movie plays while the cast provides jokes and insight regarding what you are seeing on the screen).  My kids, ages 5, 7, 8 were not interested in the Director/Star Commentary.  There are no additional bonus features on the DVD in this particular set.  Specifically, the DVD in this boxed set DOES NOT contain the &#34;Everything is Awesome&#34; sing-along, which was a huge disappointment to my children.The 2D Blu-Ray in the Awesome Edition supposedly has all of the special features.  I don't own a Blu-Ray so I may never know what it's like.I also purchased the stand alone DVD but haven't opened it.  The packaging for the standalone DVD says this:  Special features:  Fan-Made Films: Top Secret Submissions; and Everything is Awesome Sing-Along.From what I can tell based on my limited technological know-how, the Digital HD Ultraviolet component of the Awesome Edition is essentially online streaming of the movie.  You cannot download a digital copy and play it later.With the Awesome boxed set, there is only one Blu-Ray case that contains all three discs.  Two of the discs are stacked one on top of the other because there are only two holders in the case.Overall, the movie is great, but the Awesome Edition boxed set was a disappointment when it came to bonus features absent from the DVD.

This has got to win awards. I'm actually shocked at people who didn't think this was one of the greatest movies of all time.There were so many things that made me laugh beyond the first glance jokes.

It seems that Ultraviolet is trying to become the standard for digital content, and it really just sucks.  It was buggy, problematic, difficult to get answers that were more than canned cut-and-paste messages from Flixster, and makes you get a different app to view the content.We like to keep all our movies in a single place (iTunes).  The problem with this product is that it doesn't have the digital code that lets you get it in iTunes (just Ultraviolet).  There's no way to get a copy in iTunes.  To use the Ultraviolet, you have to download another app for every device you have and even then it's a pain to make it work.  Usually there are workarounds to get a copy in iTunes, but the Ultraviolet people are working hard to get you to download their apps rather than working with what most people already have.  There's not really an advantage to Ultraviolet either, so it's just an added pain-in-the-butt to create another standard that's pretty sub-standard.Bottom line, it's frustrating that any time you want to watch the movie you've got to open a different app or load the disk, rather than being able to maintain your library in one place.  The movie is great, but including Ultraviolet without the regular Digital Copy means it'll get thrown out or added to a garage sale and we'll download the iTunes version.",1,"Movie was great, product stinks",1404345600,"07 3, 2014",2014,1407,"['movie', 'was', 'great', 'review', 'product', 'not', 'movie', 'Ultraviolet', 'trying', 'become', 'standard', 'digital', 'content', 'really', 'just', 'sucks', 'was', 'buggy', 'problematic', 'difficult', 'get', 'answers', 'were', 'more', 'canned', 'cut-and-paste', 'messages', 'Flixster', 'get', 'different', 'app', 'view', 'content.We', 'keep', 'movies', 'single', 'place', 'iTunes', 'problem', 'product', ""n't"", 'have', 'digital', 'code', 'get', 'iTunes', 'just', 'Ultraviolet', 'way', 'get', 'copy', 'iTunes', 'use', 'Ultraviolet', 'have', 'download', 'app', 'device', 'have', 'even', 'then', 'pain', 'make', 'work', 'Usually', 'are', 'workarounds', 'get', 'copy', 'iTunes', 'Ultraviolet', 'people', 'are', 'working', 'hard', 'get', 'download', 'apps', 'rather', 'working', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'already', 'have', 'not', 'really', 'advantage', 'Ultraviolet', 'just', 'added', 'pain-in-the-butt', 'create', 'standard', 'pretty', 'sub-standard.Bottom', 'line', 'frustrating', 'time', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'got', 'open', 'different', 'app', 'load', 'disk', 'rather', 'being', 'able', 'maintain', 'library', 'one', 'place', 'movie', 'great', 'including', 'Ultraviolet', 'regular', 'Digital', 'Copy', ""'ll"", 'get', 'thrown', 'out', 'added', 'garage', 'sale', ""'ll"", 'download', 'iTunes', 'version']",N/A

I thought this would either be a somewhat decent film or I would end up walking out of the theater halfway through. I admit I didn't have much faith and I must also admit now how pleased I am at my surprise when I realized this is perhaps one of (if not the BEST) film of the year!Oh yeah, I went there.Now how could a movie about a children's toy (albeit, a fantastic children's toy) be turned into a film with a great plot line, characters you can relate to, and just enough detail to keep someones interest for an hour and a half? Well leave it to the geniuses at Warner Bros to not only be brave enough to start a project like this, but to succeed so well they are considering making a franchise off of this one film! A movie franchise about LEGOS people, when a risk turns out great thats when everyone profits. After viewing this film I am so excited to see what they can make with all the creativity that one can pull from the hundreds of Lego themes/worlds/and storyline possibilities. We may be seeing a ton of films like this for the next few years which isn't a bad thing at all if they are the same caliber as this film.The film itself is about Emmet; an extremely ordinary, not special, just a regular run of the mill guy who (surprise) ends up in a fantastic adventure along with a motley band of superheroes and characters from the lego worlds to stop an evil tyrant. Now I know you've seen a plot line similar like this before, but the thing about the Lego movie is that its so charming, funny, and has so many colorful visuals to it you can't help but feel like its completely fresh and wonderful. This is a film that is fun to just go and see. The animation is different and quite impressive when you realize all the work that the creators actually had to put into making this film. Oh and did i mention the cast? With voices from Chris Pratt (who is slowly taking over Hollywood. Seriously look his filmography up if you haven't yet) Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrel, Morgan Freeman, Channing Tatum, and other surprise cameos, even the actors and actresses make this film fun because they sound like they are having the time of their lives in this film.With a great cast, great colors and special effects, and a catchy soundtrack that will stay in your head (for better or worse) for the near future, this is one film you NEED to buy on DVD. You can Netflix/Redbox/whatever at first just to be safe but believe me, it will make you want to go on out and buy you own copy to watch with your family, kids, roommates, ect.

NOPE. Not paying $35 for any movie. I don't care how much trumped up junk you throw in it. To make matters worse, Amazon offers this for $34.96 (just 4-cents short of free-shipping... making it $39). There is NOTHING in this edition other than a lego figure that any other 3D RELEASE hasn't offered. When will movie studios get the hint that PEOPLE ARE POOR RIGHT NOW!! Oh, I forgot... their rich.  *sigh*... guess I'll $1 rent it.  So sorry Warner... no $$$$ from me.  Now my review of this FUN MOVIE:Every parent in the free world knows the mystique and endlessness of the Lego and every parent in the world knows the feeling of waking up in the middle of the night and feeling one of those Legos seemingly cut your foot to the bone. They also know the price tag of such Lego's and their child's disregard for formalities. That's what makes ""The Lego Movie"" such a great thing. While the 3D is dazzling and entertaining, the Lego's don't come out of the screen so that you can step on them and the price tag is no different than any other movie.All that aside, ""The Lego Movie"" is a creative and imaginative movie for all ages. An ordinary lego named Emmet Brickowski wakes up in his world where 'Everything is Awesome' and soon finds his ordinary world exploded into a world of endless possibility. When Emmet finds a mysterious girl named Wildstyle tinkering around his construction site after hours, he becomes involved in her search for an object called 'the piece of resistance'; thus opening his eyes to incredible possibilities.Every moment of the movie is endlessly entertaining and we quickly realize that the possibilities keep us continuously on our toes and unsure of what may be next. The little in-destructive pieces just keep clicking together to form more and more environments and story-lines. The entire thing plays out like an epic play day for any child; even with ghosts on strings and boats and spaceships moving off screen with a 'brrrrrrrrrrr...'With all the pop culture references and movie references, ""The Lego Movie"" is a movie that everybody will enjoy. There are endless movie references and characters such as Batman, Superman, Han Solo, Chewie, Gandolf and so on. Not only that, you won't understand the ultimate meaning of the film until its finale. After watching a movie that played liked an assault on the synapse, it finished with a feeling of calm and promise.Sure, it may have been the longest commercial in the history of film-making, but despite stepping on those little things in the middle of the night and crying out in pain, or wondering why such a little tiny thing costs so much money, Lego's are an amazing source of imagination, patience and building mentality for children; just like the movie.",4,EVERYTHING IS AWESOME... except for the price of the 3D collection,1402963200,"06 17, 2014",2014,2884,"['son', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'movie', 'today', 'BLURAY', '3D', 'was', 'prepared', 'go', 'buy', 'surprise', 'when', 'picked', 'up', 'NOPE', 'Not', 'paying', '35', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'much', 'trumped', 'up', 'junk', 'throw', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Amazon', '34.96', 'just', '4-cents', 'short', 'free-shipping', 'making', '39', 'NOTHING', 'edition', 'other', 'lego', 'figure', 'other', '3D', 'RELEASE', ""n't"", 'offered', 'When', 'will', 'movie', 'studios', 'get', 'hint', 'PEOPLE', 'ARE', 'POOR', 'RIGHT', 'NOW', 'Oh', 'forgot', 'rich', '*sigh*', 'guess', ""'ll"", '1', 'rent', 'So', 'sorry', 'Warner', 'Now', 'review', 'FUN', 'MOVIE', 'parent', 'free', 'world', 'mystique', 'endlessness', 'Lego', 'parent', 'world', 'feeling', 'waking', 'up', 'middle', 'night', 'feeling', 'one', 'Legos', 'seemingly', 'cut', 'foot', 'bone', 'also', 'know', 'price', 'tag', 'such', 'Lego', 'child', 'disregard', 'formalities', 'what', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'such', 'great', 'thing', '3D', 'dazzling', 'entertaining', 'Lego', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'screen', 'so', 'can', 'step', 'price', 'tag', 'different', 'other', 'movie.All', 'aside', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'creative', 'imaginative', 'movie', 'ages', 'ordinary', 'lego', 'named', 'Emmet', 'Brickowski', 'up', 'world', 'where', ""'Everything"", 'Awesome', 'soon', 'ordinary', 'world', 'exploded', 'world', 'endless', 'possibility', 'When', 'Emmet', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'named', 'Wildstyle', 'tinkering', 'construction', 'site', 'hours', 'involved', 'search', 'object', 'called', ""'the"", 'piece', 'resistance', 'thus', 'opening', 'eyes', 'incredible', 'possibilities.Every', 'moment', 'movie', 'endlessly', 'entertaining', 'quickly', 'realize', 'possibilities', 'keep', 'continuously', 'toes', 'unsure', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'next', 'little', 'in-destructive', 'pieces', 'just', 'keep', 'clicking', 'together', 'form', 'more', 'more', 'environments', 'story-lines', 'entire', 'thing', 'out', 'epic', 'play', 'day', 'child', 'even', 'ghosts', 'strings', 'boats', 'spaceships', 'moving', 'off', 'screen', ""'brrrrrrrrrrr"", 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'movie', 'references', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'movie', 'everybody', 'will', 'enjoy', 'are', 'endless', 'movie', 'references', 'characters', 'such', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'Han', 'Solo', 'Chewie', 'Gandolf', 'so', 'Not', 'only', 'wo', ""n't"", 'understand', 'ultimate', 'meaning', 'film', 'finale', 'watching', 'movie', 'played', 'liked', 'assault', 'synapse', 'finished', 'feeling', 'calm', 'promise.Sure', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'longest', 'commercial', 'history', 'film-making', 'stepping', 'little', 'things', 'middle', 'night', 'crying', 'out', 'pain', 'wondering', 'why', 'little', 'tiny', 'thing', 'costs', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'Lego', 'are', 'amazing', 'source', 'imagination', 'patience', 'building', 'mentality', 'children', 'just', 'movie']",N/A
1599621,A286RTX7LFZSJQ,B009NNM77E,Christopher Price,"[143, 185]","I have to admit, when I went into the theater to see this movie, I was expecting a lot of typical Lego humor and very little plot. I was right about the Lego humor, it was hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable. Every other moment, another pun or random visual or spoken joke was made. The humor, in my mind, was better than in any other lego movie that I have ever seen. The humor was enjoyable for kids and adults, playing heavily with the visual humor as well as on the humor in the unexpected.The biggest surprise was the plot. Any lego short or movie has been weak on plot. Even the best Lego movies of the past were mainly funny with a shallow, kid's movie plot. This film, however, had a fairly deep plot, hitting more than one lesson for children and adults alike. Instead of pushing individuality through complete uniqueness, the story presented a strong argument for the importance for teamwork, even in the highly skilled. The lessons drove the plot home as the story carried a consistent story line. Though not like the story lines of Disney or Dreamworks, this story is great in a different way, making it an extremely unique children's film.Lastly, as others have commented, the film's special effects and the attention to detail on the Lego building sequences was astonishing. The film presented a high quality of visual clarity, making the film much more enjoyable and much easier to get into.Overall, this film impressed me. It was a truly enjoyable film. Like Disney's Frozen, this film was a pleasant surprise from the animated genre, and like Frozen, it is just as much for adults as it was for kids.Visual Quality: 4.84Plot: 4.61Overall Rating: 4.72",5,Everything Was Awesome!,1392076800,"02 11, 2014",2014,1666,"['have', 'admit', 'when', 'went', 'theater', 'see', 'movie', 'was', 'expecting', 'lot', 'typical', 'Lego', 'humor', 'very', 'little', 'plot', 'was', 'right', 'Lego', 'humor', 'was', 'hilarious', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'other', 'moment', 'pun', 'random', 'visual', 'spoken', 'joke', 'was', 'made', 'humor', 'mind', 'was', 'better', 'other', 'lego', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'humor', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'kids', 'adults', 'playing', 'heavily', 'visual', 'humor', 'as', 'well', 'humor', 'unexpected.The', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'was', 'plot', 'lego', 'short', 'movie', 'been', 'weak', 'plot', 'Even', 'best', 'Lego', 'movies', 'past', 'were', 'mainly', 'funny', 'shallow', 'kid', 'movie', 'plot', 'film', 'however', 'had', 'fairly', 'deep', 'plot', 'hitting', 'more', 'one', 'lesson', 'children', 'adults', 'alike', 'Instead', 'pushing', 'individuality', 'complete', 'uniqueness', 'story', 'presented', 'strong', 'argument', 'importance', 'teamwork', 'even', 'highly', 'skilled', 'lessons', 'drove', 'plot', 'home', 'story', 'carried', 'consistent', 'story', 'line', 'not', 'story', 'lines', 'Disney', 'Dreamworks', 'story', 'great', 'different', 'way', 'making', 'extremely', 'unique', 'children', 'film.Lastly', 'others', 'have', 'commented', 'film', 'special', 'effects', 'attention', 'detail', 'Lego', 'building', 'sequences', 'was', 'astonishing', 'film', 'presented', 'high', 'quality', 'visual', 'clarity', 'making', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'much', 'easier', 'get', 'into.Overall', 'film', 'impressed', 'was', 'truly', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'Disney', 'Frozen', 'film', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'animated', 'genre', 'Frozen', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'adults', 'was', 'kids.Visual', 'Quality', '4.84Plot', '4.61Overall', 'Rating', '4.72']",N/A

That's ambitious for a kids movie and The Lego Movie pulls it off brilliantly. The cast of characters is perfect for the message they are trying to convey, as is the idea of using a lego world as a microcosm for our own.

Its message is a mess of predigested secular or Pagan takeoffs on the Judeo-Christian tradition, not direct takeoffs, but borrowings of borrowings. &#34;Jokes&#34; come fast and furious. They come so fast you don't have time to assess whether they are funny or not. Example: Liam Neeson voices a police officer, and he sings a few seconds of &#34;Danny Boy.&#34; This is supposed to be funny because Liam Neeson is Irish. It's a joke! Get it huh huh? Get how clever it is? You don't have to think about that, because another joke is coming down the chute.There's something really smug and divorced from the audience about all this joking. I can just see the writers slapping themselves on the back, congratulating themselves, &#34;Gosh, aren't we clever?&#34;Morgan Freeman, whom I used to like but who has become predictably ubiquitous in his unending God roles, plays the part of God, or close enough in this secular/Pagan/superhero super derivative mash-up. He tells Emmet (truth in Hebrew; not sure if there is any intended connection) that he, Emmet, is the Messiah. Only the film uses the word &#34;Special.&#34; Same thing. Eventually the moral of the film is revealed: if you believe in yourself, you are the Messiah, the most intelligent, powerful, interesting person on the planet. Wow, that will make for healthy and happy kids. Not. Luckily the film is incoherent enough that many kids won't even realize that that is the film's message.In this heavy-handed movie, there's a heavy-handed, live action coda that breaks with all that has gone before. The message of the coda: suit-wearing, rules-following, heterosexual white American businessmen are the biggest menace to the planet, and we should all be more anarchic, creative and narcissistic. Wow, that's a message that Hollywood has never sent before.Nothing that happens in the action onscreen matters. It's one long chase, with Lego characters turning themselves into whatever they want at will, and flying freely. Since they can do this &#8211; turn themselves into weapons or escape vehicles &#8211; it doesn't really seem to matter that they are occasionally captured by a character named &#34;Bad Cop&#34; &#8211; problems with authority much? &#8211; tortured, and threatened with genocide. Yes, really. There are torture scenes in a movie meant for preschoolers. I found the torture scenes hard to watch, not because they were moving, but because they were weird and out of place.

There were a few chuckles in the preview, but nothing that really compelled me to run right out and see it. My son actually passed on going as the movie just didn't seem to catch his interest. So we grab our corn and our 3D glasses and headed in....and had a total BLAST!!Watching the DVD, I knew we weren't going to get the 3D, and I wondered if any of this film's magic would be lost watching in 2D. I have to say that this movie is just as fun watching at home as it was in the theater.As the movie opens we see an evil ruler known as Lord Business taking over a super-weapon known as &#34;kragle&#34; and blinding the Wizard who was protecting the weapon. The Wizard warns Lord Business that someone known as &#34;The Special&#34; will find a unique piece of resistance that will stop Lord Business from destroying the universe with the &#34;kragle&#34;.Flash forward eight years and we meet Emmet, a construction worker who does his best to fit in with the other citizens of Bricksburg, a huge metropolis where everything is orderly and everyone is the same. Everybody listens to the same music and watches the same TV shows, and basically does everything by following the instructions. After working at the construction site all day, the rest of the group are going to grab some dinner, and Emmet plans to tag along, only to get let behind when he's distracted by a pretty girl breaking the rules by wandering around the construction site. Emmet immediately falls for the girl, and falls down a hole in the ground, stumbling upon the &#34;piece of resistance&#34;. Emmet soon learns he is &#34;The Special&#34;, and sets out to stop Lord Business.The jokes are rapid fire as the film opens, and you are pulled right into the movie. The music and visuals are fantastic and extremely imaginative (try getting &#34;Everything is Awesome&#34; out of your head after watching this movie!!). The voice cast is fantastic with Liam Neeson, Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Morgan Freeman..it's a fantastic cast that really brings their characters to life. The only thing keeping me from giving this film 5 stars is the prolonged ending. The climax of the film drags on for a bit, and the movie loses steam in the last 15 minutes or so.But with that said, don't let it deter you from grabbing this movie.

The children in the audience where this reviewer saw the movie were absolutely enthralled, and very obviously enjoying it.The plot borrows liberally from the Matrix, Star War, Batman, and any number of other movies. The average, everyman Emmet, a construction worker, is apparently the person foreseen by a prophecy to save the world from the evil Lord Business. The easy-going Emmet is a little skeptical, but he will get lots of encouragement and coaching from the beautiful Wyldstyle, the wise Vitruvius, and even the action-oriented Batman, a rival for the affections of Wyldstyle. The story moves rapidly from venue to venue in its own unique universe, delivering a clear and simple moral suitable for children.For the adults, it isn't a bad movie. The references to other movies can be funny, and there are plenty of sight gags hidden in the scenes to watch for. The moral of the movie is laid on rather thickly, but the adults may actually relate best to the live action sequence at the end.

1599664,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B009NNM77E,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[21, 30]","Hype for this movie has been at a fever pitch ever since release, and even though I was a little late to the show, I could understand why. The pedigree behind it was top-notch, the casting was great, and the prospect of a multi-universe crossover from several unrelated franchises was enticing. In a word, it looked fun, and like the type of movie that both kids and adults could enjoy. That, however, was a terrible underestimation, because it was far more than fun, although it certainly was that in spades. But &#34;The Lego Movie&#34; is also emotional, thrilling, and, in more ways than one, a total surprise. Warner Brothers managed to blindside me with this one, and while it may not top a certain Disney movie involving ice (at least, in my book), it's still an incredible feat in its own right.Emmet is a typical Lego minifigure. That's no joke. He's actually the generic figure, complete with a blank-slate face and a typical haircut. That's just perfect for him though, as he lives in a city where everybody is encouraged to behave in uniform fashion by the ominous Lord Business. Unfortunately, though, he's so thoroughly average in every respect that nobody seems to notice him, which isn't the best situation to be in when he's suspected of a massive crime. The crime, as it so happens, is stumbling upon &#34;The Piece of Resistance,&#34; which will stop Business' plan of unleashing a mysterious weapon known as &#34;The Kragle&#34; upon the unsuspecting populace. Luckily, he gets rescued by the deadly and sexy (as far as Lego people can go) Wildstyle, who reveals to him that his world is only one in a series of many universes, and that Business has plans to use the Kragle on all of them. This sets off a wild adventure to stop the villain, with the aid of several heroes, known as &#34;Master Builders,&#34; and for Emmet to discover his hidden potential that may very well change everything as the characters know it.If this sounds like a trite set-up, it's because it kind of is, but that's the point. See, despite the movie being insanely creative and funny, not to mention subversive in a weird of way, the overall narrative seemingly proceeds in a formulaic fashion... for reasons that will make sense about two-thirds of the way through it. While it's tempting to discuss this twist, it would ruin the element of creativity and surprise that makes the whole experience work. Rest assured that any gripe you have with the plot will, most likely, be thrown out the window when you realize what's really going on, and why things seemed sort of cliche for a bit. In all my years of watching films, the writers on board here delivered one of the best silver screen twists since &#34;The Sixth Sense,&#34; which is no small accomplishment.But what about the rest of the movie? Fortunately, the formulaic narrative up until that point is aided by three things: a great cast, wickedly funny dialogue, and clever visual trickery that's worth the ticket price alone. Everybody here is perfectly cast, with special props going out to Will Arnett for his deadpan, lampooning take on Batman, Allison Brie as the infectious and adorable Unikitty, and Charlie Day as the ADD-addled Benny. However, it's worth noting that Chris Pratt as Emmet is one of the better low-key performances in any film recently, even those by directors who specialize in that niche like Wes Anderson. Sure, he'll occasionally make a silly joke, but on a deeper level, he turns a stock Lego figure into somebody with genuine pathos, whom almost anybody could surely relate to.On top of the great cast, everything on the A/V side of things is charming and awe-inspiring in equal amounts. There's a score from Mark Mothersbaugh (known for both his excellent video game and film scores, as well as being a member of Devo,) which effortlessly blends styles at the drop of a dime, and routinely shifts from emotional to peppy, thrilling to soothing. It complements the visuals well, which are nothing short of remarkable, and probably the best usage of CGI animation I've seen in all my years. Yes, that includes every Pixar flick. To me, everything in &#34;The Lego Movie&#34; is teeming with life, somehow overcoming the fact that everything is supposed to be made out of plastic. Everything in this movie, being made of the titular plastic bricks, is used in a wide variety of surprising ways, especially in the powerful and inspiring climax. Anything can become, well, anything, if that makes any sense, and seeing somebody use the art of animation in this way should make Pixar ashamed of how derivative and bland their last few movies have been.There's no way around it, really. Much like &#34;Frozen,&#34; &#34;The Lego Movie&#34; is not just a good &#34;animated movie.&#34; It's not just &#34;good for a kids' flick,&#34; or &#34;funny enough for adults to like.&#34; As a film critic, this is one of the most brilliantly constructed (if you'll pardon the pun) films in years, and emotionally resonated with me in many respects, especially when the film's world and lore is fully realized in the final act. This is, quite simply, one of the greatest animated films ever created, and to a lesser extent, one of the best films to come along, and certainly one of the most wildly inventive. Subversive, cheeky, and beautiful in many regards, this is a movie that I feel almost anybody could enjoy.If not, well, maybe you're just missing a piece.Grade: A-",5,"Everything Is, Indeed,

DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound will transport viewers to another world by surrounding them in the sounds, explosions, and music of the Lego Universe.The film is rated PG for mild action and rude humor. Although some might say there's some violence, it's always meant to be lighthearted and never taken seriously. After all, they ARE only Legos. The only people who will have a problem with this movie are ones who don't like the violent silliness of &#34;The Three Stooges.&#34;I was sent &#34;The Lego Movie: Everything is Awesome&#34; Edition. It features 3D, 2D, DVD, and UltraViolet versions of the film. A 3D Emmet stand-up and exclusive Vitruvius mini-figure are included as well.

Audio commentary is provided by Directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord and actors Chris Pratt, Will Arnett, Charlie Day, and Alison Brie.Two behind-the-scenes featurettes include &#34;Bringing LEGO to Life&#34; and &#34;Stories from the Story Team.&#34; Special building instruction shorts are bunched together as &#34;See It, Built It!&#34; Other special features are deleted scenes, outtakes, a sing-along, music video, homemade animated clips, an animation test, teasers, and trailers.&#34;The Lego Movie&#34; is a rousing good time for the whole family. It's front-loaded with enough juvenile humor to satisfy any child and packed with a sufficient amount of pop culture references to attract older audiences and members of the geek illuminati. The only thing you have to worry about is the annoyance you'll begin to experience from having your kids run around the house singing &#34;Everything is Awesome&#34; day and night.",4,"Plenty of fun for the whole family with ""The Lego Movie"" Blu-ray / DVD",1403481600,"06 23, 2014",2014,2950,"['What', 'can', 'be', 'said', '34', 'Lego', 'Movie', '34', 'already', ""n't"", 'think', 'millions', 'millions', 'children', 'singing', 'songs', 'blockbuster', 'sum', 'everything', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'Warner', 'Bros.', 'Pictures', 'Lego', 'brand', 'have', 'most', 'definitely', 'hit', 'pay', 'dirt', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'rough', 'tumble', 'boys', 'looking', 'build', 'something', 'knock', 'down', 'even', 'gentle', 'little', 'girls', 'who', 'dream', 'princesses', 'Uni-Kitties', 'Now', 'hit', 'released', 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'guaranteeing', 'kids', 'will', 'watch', 'non-stop', 'assembling', 'new', 'house', 'live', 'spaceship', 'fly', 'work.The', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Business', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'plots', 'glue', 'Lego', 'Universe', 'together', 'permanent', 'harmony', 'construction', 'worker', 'named', 'Emmet', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'believed', 'be', '34', 'Special', '34', 'who', 'will', 'deliver', 'Lego', 'world', 'grasps', 'tyrant', 'up', 'feisty', 'female', 'Wyldstyle', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Batman', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Superman', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'other', 'reluctant', 'heroes', 'stop', 'oppressor', 'minions.The', 'Blu-ray', 'edition', '34', 'Lego', 'Movie', '34', 'presented', '1080p', 'High-Definition', 'Aspect', 'ratio', '2.39:1', 'picture', 'quality', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'terms', 'clarity', 'vibrant', 'colors', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '5.1', 'surround', 'sound', 'will', 'transport', 'viewers', 'world', 'surrounding', 'sounds', 'explosions', 'music', 'Lego', 'Universe.The', 'film', 'rated', 'PG', 'mild', 'action', 'rude', 'humor', 'might', 'say', 'violence', 'always', 'meant', 'be', 'lighthearted', 'never', 'taken', 'seriously', 'ARE', 'only', 'Legos', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'will', 'have', 'problem', 'movie', 'are', 'ones', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'violent', 'silliness', '34', 'Three', 'Stooges.', '34', 'was', 'sent', '34', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'Everything', 'Awesome', '34', 'Edition', '3D', '2D', 'DVD', 'UltraViolet', 'versions', 'film', '3D', 'Emmet', 'stand-up', 'exclusive', 'Vitruvius', 'mini-figure', 'are', 'included', 'well', 'plenty', 'bonus', 'material', 'excite', 'whole', 'family', '34', 'Lego', 'Movie', '34', 'Blu-ray', 'Audio', 'commentary', 'provided', 'Directors', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'actors', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Alison', 'Brie.Two', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurettes', 'include', '34', 'Bringing', 'LEGO', 'Life', '34', '34', 'Stories', 'Story', 'Team.', '34', 'Special', 'building', 'instruction', 'shorts', 'are', 'bunched', 'together', '34', 'See', 'Built', '34', 'Other', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'outtakes', 'sing-along', 'music', 'video', 'homemade', 'animated', 'clips', 'animation', 'test', 'teasers', 'trailers.', '34', 'Lego', 'Movie', '34', 'rousing', 'good', 'time', 'whole', 'family', 'front-loaded', 'enough', 'juvenile', 'humor', 'satisfy', 'child', 'packed', 'sufficient', 'amount', 'pop', 'culture', 'references', 'attract', 'older', 'audiences', 'members', 'geek', 'illuminati', 'only', 'thing', 'have', 'worry', 'about', 'annoyance', ""'ll"", 'begin', 'experience', 'having', 'kids', 'run', 'house', 'singing', '34', 'Everything', 'Awesome', '34', 'day', 'night']",N/A

The recent trend to turn games and toys into Hollywood blockbusters has not be successful (think BATTLESHIP) yet THE LEGO MOVIE works on all levels and it really is total fun for kids and adults.The writers created a crisp and hilarious script on a simple premise we have seen over and over--an evil tyrant trying to destroy the (Lego) world as everyone knows it. These are LEGO characters and somehow it all seems real and simply delightful. Our heroes and villains travel through various Lego worlds in their quest to save the world. It all starts with mild-mannered and boring construction worked BLAKE who finds out he is destined to save the world.Add in the voices of some great actors like Morgan Freeman along with several cameo celebrity voices and you have quite the movie. How the writers crammed it all in amazes me. Hans Solo and the STAR WARS gang, Batman, Wonder Woman and other super heroes..Hey, even William Shakespeare and Abraham Lincoln are in the mix.Eventually, the LEGO world is tied in with the &#34;real&#34; world with a human and Lego &#34;people&#34; scene--somewhat like an episode of the classic TV show THE TWILIGHT ZONE.By far the funniest character for me was Liam Neeson's voicing of the Good Cop/Bad Cop. Neeson, always the straight dramatic actor, gets to have some fun with comedy and voices. Good Cop becomes Bad cop by the turn of his head.I got the DVD/Blu-ray combo pack so there were lots of fun extras.

I venture to guess that most of the rugrats won't be familiar with this one, but I could be wrong.Bottom line?

I've seen LEGO Ninjago and LEGO Super Heroes.  Both were great shows.  This is, however, the first LEGO full length movie I've seen.  I am not a fan of LEGO as a toy brand, and I hate the video games, but the animations are always great.  The LEGO Movie is no exception![SPOILERS AHEAD]Will Ferrell's character, Lord Business, is perhaps one of the most believable villains I've seen on the big screen, because he isn't really evil at all.  He's just misunderstood.  He wants his creations to stay the way they are, and in order to accomplish this stagnant state, he has to control the world.  The lead character, Emmet (played by Chris Pratt), is part of that world as the most ordinary LEGO minifigure in existence.  He follows all the rules, he agrees with everything, and he finds everything awesome.The story revolves around those two characters playfully waging war on each other throughout a small variety of LEGO lands and eventually developing a dialogue with each other and working out their differences.  The end shows the real world alternative to this story, in which Will Farrell comes to terms with his son's desire to play and be creative with his father's creations.  The real world doesn't start having any involvement in the story until the end, which feels a little odd, but I like how it was done.  Overall, the movie was an unforgettable experience that will stick with me for years to come.  The LEGO Movie is a clear candidate for my Ultraviolet collection, because I could watch it over and over again.Humor level: 9001/10.Storytelling level: 9/10.Animation quality level: 10/10.Music quality level: 8/10.No idea what the DVD special features are going to be like... but the movie alone is worth the purchase.",5,An imperfection with a great message and equally entertaining voice work and amazing LEGO animation.

Please allow me to explain.  The movie is all about finding the master builder.  He is needed to stop an evil Lego figure from gluing all the logos.  The one they think is the master builder does not believe in himself very much.  He is kind of a dork who follows everything by the book.  He has to find a way to believe in himself and learn to sometimes do things out of the book.  Along the way, he finds a cast of characters that many will know.  The characters include Lego batman and Superman.  The movie is full of pop culture stuff.  I felt like I was in a time machine bringing me back to the 80s and 90s.  It was great.  It is such a funny movie also.  Many times throughout the movie, people there laughed.  It was just fun.As for my rating of a 4.  I really liked the movie and have pre ordered it.  But, I think this would be better watched at home.  It just seemed to drag on a bit to long.  Not that I did not enjoy the entire film.  I just had that feeling.  Also, it depends on the way you look at the movie.  My mom feel asleep for a bit.  She said she thought it was funny, but she thought because it was Lego's, she just fell asleep.  I did not see it that way.  I did not see this as a movie with Lego's.  I saw it as a cool movie with lots of action and comedy.  Also, the end of the movie changed everything.  I am not going to give anything away.  But the last 20 minutes or so changed the entire meaning of the movie.  It made it even better than it already was.

1599711,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B009NNM77E,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","As someone who grew up playing with LEGOs, and who loved making crazy contraptions with the various sets, I was intrigued by the fact that this classic plaything was getting its own movie.  What would be the plot?  At least toy-based franchises of the past such as Transformers, My Little Pony, He-Man, and the Ninja Turtles at least had an overarching plot, even if it was a flimsy one, to accompany them and provide a framework.  LEGOs have always been incredibly freeform, and even if some sets do have storylines behind them (such as Bionicle or the licensed properties that have gained playsets), for the most part LEGOs are pretty much whatever you want them to be.  So I approached the LEGO movie with caution, despite hearing rave reviews, and figured that given the fact that the creators would have a wide-open sandbox to play in rather than a pre-set storyline, this could go in practically any direction... even a bad one.I thought the movie was good but not great as I watched, with a great deal of silliness and weirdness but a sense of playfulness that one rarely sees in film anymore.  And then came the twist... and it elevated the movie from something entertaining but clich&eacute; to one of the best pictures of the year.""The LEGO Movie"" opens on an epic confrontation between the evil Lord Business and the benevolent wizard Vitruvius, as the latter delivers a prophecy that a chosen one called ""the Special"" will find a mysterious artifact called the Piece of Resistance that will save their universe.  Cut to years later, when upbeat but generic everyman Emmett gets ready for another average day in the happy but bland town of Bricksville, ruled over by President Business and his army of robot police.  When Emmett stumbles upon the mysterious Piece of Resistance (which attaches itself to his back), he learns that he, of all people, is the Special, and he must use the piece to defeat Lord Business and his terrifying new weapon, the Kragle, which will stick the entire universe into place forever.  With the help of an eclectic group of Master Builders -- Vitruvius, action girl WyldStyle, energetic spaceman Benny, upbeat and adorable Princess Unikitty, and Batman (yes, Batman) -- Emmett has to evade Lord Business' goons and his henchman, the dual-personalitied Bad Cop/Good Cop, and find it in himself to save the universe... if he can find the instructions first.First off, the animation in this film is FANTASTIC.  It's a CGI film with only a few parts done in LEGO-based stop-action (most notably the closing credits), but the animation is so well-done and painstakingly detailed that it looks almost exactly like a stop-motion feature.  Everything is made of LEGO -- EVERYTHING.  Not just the setting, characters, and props, but such details as water, fire, explosions, and even motion blurs.  The amount of detail worked into the film is mind-boggling, and viewers who grew up with LEGOs will have fun identifying favorite pieces, playsets, mini-figure characters, and much more.The characters are a fun bunch as well.  Emmett is a generic everyman thrust into the role of Chosen One, but that ends up being vital to the story, and he comes to learn that even someone as generic as he is can be special.  Wyldstyle is the typical snarky action girl, but she has some unexpected depth later on in the film, and the wise wizard Vivitrius isn't a bland Obi-wan Kenobi type but a snarky and funny character.  Minor characters like Benny and Unikitty are adorable, and the villainous Lord Business and Bad Cop are hilariously over-the-top villains.  Various minor characters are a treat to see as well, and even licensed characters are given moments to shine -- Batman is almost a parody of himself, and Superman and Green Lantern's interactions nearly made me fall out of my chair.Like most animated movies are wont to do anymore, ""The LEGO Movie"" is full of celebrity and big-name voice actors in many of its roles.  Chriss Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Will Ferrell, Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Charlie Day, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Keith Fergusen, and Billy Dee Williams are just a few of the names you might recognize, both in major and minor roles in the film.The plot?  Well, the plot is fairly silly and clich&eacute; at first, though by the time the movie was a third of the way through I found myself getting into it and enjoying it, even if it wasn't the most original plot ever.  But about two-thirds of the way through the movie... we get a major twist that changes everything you thought you knew about the movie.  It's foreshadowed a bit, but can still come as a surprise, and it's what elevated the movie from a silly but entertaining flick to something unexpectedly powerful.  I won't say more for fear of spoiling, however...Not quite as good as the best of Disney, DreamWorks, or Pixar, but this is still a great film, good for kids or for adults who remember playing with LEGOs and want a nostalgic film.  And it's easily one of the best animated films in recent years.  Suitable for children 8 and up, due to some violence and scary scenes.",5,"Silly but fun, nostalgic, and unexpectedly powerful animated film",1404086400,"06 30, 2014",2014,5091,"['someone', 'who',

I know why it&#8217;s so highly rated and was number one at the box office in its first 3 weeks in a row! It&#8217;s clever. It&#8217;s funny. It&#8217;s witty. It&#8217;s smart. It&#8217;s filled with innuendos and hidden and not-so hidden sight-gags and an ensemble cast of characters that each one will have you in tears with humor. The movie has a real heart and went into the story knowing that they couldn&#8217;t take themselves too seriously and as a result, just had gobs and gobs of fun! So much fun! Too much fun!The screenplay was written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ( both writing Extreme Movie, Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs) from an original story by Phil, Christopher and also Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman (both writing for Nijago for TV). Now it was also directed by Phil and Christopher and obviously became a labor of love for them to do this project. Using mainly CGI, mixed with Live-Action and some stop-motion &#8211; this film is at very least beside being hysterically funny, colorful and inventive.My hats off the following cast who just blew me away at how ridiculously wild and crazy they can be by bringing these toy interlocking characters to life. Here a little about them &#8211; I&#8217;ll let the movie itself fill you in with all the details&#8230;Chris Pratt (Moneyball, Her) as Emmet Brickowski, a young man with no purpose, no goals, no ideas or an original thought &#8211; yet he is the &#8216;chosen one&#8217; to save the universe.

(Again, I say no more.)Will Ferrell (Anchorman, Elf) as Lord Business &#8211; this character is a surprise comic hit as his mission is to destroy the universe created by &#8216;the man upstairs&#8217; &#8211; wink, wink. It&#8217;s because of him thereis a wonderful twist by the end. (It&#8217;ll make sense when you see it &#8211; and you must!Morgan Freeman (Dricing Miss Daisy, Seven) as Vitruvius who is one of the funniest characters on the screen, he fights, has special powers, has special eyes and even the ability &#8211; well, you really have to see it. To see how he &#8216;strings&#8217; along.Liam Neeson (Schindler&#8217;s List, Taken) as Bad Cop/Good Cop who again steels the scenes he is in because he is two personalities of the same person and both are in conflict with the other and with &#8216;Lord Business&#8217;.I don&#8217;t want to ruin the ending for you but you will be very pleasantly surprised when you see it. It has a very well rounded and touchingly funny ending. There are vocal surprises like Anthony Daniels (Star Wars), Shaquille O&#8217;Neal (Lakers), Channing Tatum (21 Jump Street, Whitehouse Down), Billy Dee Williams (The Empire Strikes Back, Lady Sings The Blues) and Jonah Hill (Wolf of Wallstreet, Moneyball).This movie is truly great for the whole family but especially the adults because the humor is smart and witty and you&#8217;ll probably be laughing far more than the kids will, although the kids next to me were laughing just as hard.

I grew up on Legos, loved and still love them, and think -- aside from the choking hazards and dangers of slicing open a bare foot on a stray piece -- they're fantastic toys for kids. Great for improving intelligence, creativity, and general thinking/problem solving skills. However, Lego Movie? When I heard of it, I was reminded of the eleven-year-old me walking out of a showing of THE WIZARD all amped by what my prepubescent mind had thought was a great film (I had a lot to learn). My friends and I couldn't stop gushing about how cool the film had been, but my dad interrupted us by saying, &#34;You realize I just paid cash so we could all sit through a ninety-minute ad for Nintendo?&#34; I figured that the Lego Movie would be visually stunning and probably a little funnier and more relatable than THE WIZARD (movie makers have gotten smart; kids' films still need to appeal on some level to adults), but I didn't expect anything very compelling. Unless it was going to compel me to buy more Legos.What a wonderful, wonderful surprise then, when the movie turned out to be not just creative and clever, but a celebration of being clever and creative. Legos all come with books that tell you how to make the item you see on the cover of the box, but any fan of Legos knows that the real joy comes in seeing what else you can make of them, and this movie takes that idea and creates an intelligent little mythos to its world that spins together fantasy and reality, adults and children, and is absolutely hilarious in the process.Saying more would ruin it. Let's just say that this is one of the best, funniest, most consistently delightful films I've seen in a long time. I can't imagine what anyone would have to complain about it, unless they have a hard time looking past the product placement to the truly inspirational, touching, and warming message that is woven through every beautifully rendered image and hilariously constructed  joke.",5,Constructing A Masterpiece,1401062400,"05 26, 2014",2014,2031,"['When', 'heard', 'was', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'coming', 'out', 'was', 'immediately', 'skeptical', 'grew', 'up', 'Legos', 'loved', 'still', 'love', 'think', 'aside', 'choking', 'hazards', 'dangers', 'slicing', 'open', 'bare', 'foot', 'stray', 'piece', ""'re"", 'fantastic', 'toys', 'kids', 'Great', 'improving', 'intelligence', 'creativity', 'general', 'thinking/problem', 'solving', 'skills', 'However', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'When', 'heard', 'was', 'reminded', 'eleven-year-old', 'walking', 'showing', 'THE', 'WIZARD', 'amped', 'what', 'prepubescent', 'mind', 'had', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'learn', 'friends', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'gushing', 'how', 'cool', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'dad', 'interrupted', 'saying', '34', 'realize', 'just', 'paid', 'cash', 'could', 'sit', 'ninety-minute', 'ad', 'Nintendo', '34', 'figured', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'would', 'be', 'visually', 'stunning', 'probably', 'little', 'funnier', 'more', 'relatable', 'WIZARD', 'movie', 'makers', 'have', 'gotten', 'smart', 'kids', 'films', 'still', 'need', 'appeal', 'level', 'adults', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'very', 'compelling', 'was', 'going', 'compel', 'buy', 'more', 'wonderful', 'wonderful', 'surprise', 'then', 'when', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'not', 'just', 'creative', 'clever', 'celebration', 'being', 'clever', 'creative', 'Legos', 'come', 'books', 'tell', 'how', 'make', 'item', 'see', 'cover', 'box', 'fan', 'Legos', 'real', 'joy', 'seeing', 'what', 'else', 'can', 'make', 'movie', 'idea', 'intelligent', 'little', 'mythos', 'world', 'together', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'adults', 'children', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'process.Saying', 'more', 'would', 'ruin', 'Let', 'just', 'say', 'one', 'best', 'funniest', 'most', 'consistently', 'delightful', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'what', 'anyone', 'would', 'have', 'complain', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'looking', 'product', 'placement', 'truly', 'inspirational', 'touching', 'warming', 'message', 'woven', 'beautifully', 'rendered', 'image', 'hilariously', 'constructed', 'joke']",N/A

Movie studio exec logic: There will always be parents of young children who desperately want their children to shut up for two hours or so, and a movie is a great way of getting that to happen. I expected very little of &#8220;The Lego Movie,&#8221; and almost skipped it, and would have if the word-of-mouth wasn&#8217;t all that it was.I&#8217;m happy to say that &#8220;The Lego Movie&#8221; was not made for kids.It was made for the hundreds of millions of grown-up children who have fond memories of playing with Legos as children. This is the magical kind of movie that can awaken the child within you, and remind even the most jaded audience that they are still capable of experiencing this lighthearted kind of fun - even if it&#8217;s just in a movie.The animation is truly a stroke of genius - for directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, this is a passion piece that took a long time to get made, and it shows. The film is a love letter to your childhood, and is enjoyable from beginning to end.Emmett (Chris Pratt) is an ordinary guy (erm&#8230;Lego figurine) from Bricksburg (or any-city-USA) who is declared the &#8216;special&#8217; to help Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) save the world from an evil dictator who everyone thinks is the good guy - they are the only ones who know the truth.The plot isn&#8217;t much different from other &#8216;chosen one&#8217; stories, where the underdog ultimately saves the day - always a good message for young audiences. What really makes this film special is that there&#8217;s just as much here for the adults as there is for the kids. The script is a work of near-genius, with lots of timely satire and biting observations that one probably didn&#8217;t expect from &#8220;The Lego Movie.&#8221;Everyone in the fictional community of Bricksburg follows all of the rules - watch the same TV shows as everyone else, buy overpriced coffee like everyone else, follow rules made by the government, like everyone else - because the government has everyone&#8217;s best interest in mind, right? Even the film&#8217;s annoyingly catchy pop song &#8220;Everything is Awesome&#8221; isn&#8217;t what it seems. It&#8217;s about fascism.Once your eyes make the adjustment to the odd, yet intoxicating animation style, you&#8217;re bound to have a lot of fun at &#8220;The Lego Movie,&#8221; It&#8217;s really a work of genius - hilarious at almost every turn, sentimental when it counts, but not condescending - and fast-paced to the degree where you need to watch it a second time just to catch everything you may have missed the first time.Grade: A",5,A love letter to your childhood...,1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2014,2767,"['Animated', 'films', 'are', 'basically', 'cash-grab', 'business', 'Unnecessary', 'sequels', 'spinoffs', 'are', 'made', 'are', 'movies', 'still', 'make', 'money', 'Movie', 'studio', 'exec', 'logic', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'parents', 'young', 'children', 'who', 'desperately', 'want', 'children', 'shut', 'up', 'two', 'hours', 'so', 'movie', 'great', 'way', 'getting', 'happen', 'expected', 'very', 'little', '8220', 'Lego', 'Movie', '8221', 'almost', 'skipped', 'would', 'have', 'word-of-mouth', 'wasn', '8217', '8217', 'happy', 'say', '8220', 'Lego', 'Movie', '8221', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'kids.It', 'was', 'made', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'grown-up', 'children', 'who', 'have', 'fond', 'memories', 'playing', 'Legos', 'children', 'magical', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'awaken', 'child', 'remind', 'even', 'most', 'jaded', 'audience', 'are', 'still', 'capable', 'experiencing', 'lighthearted', 'kind', 'fun', 'even', '8217', 's', 'just', 'movie.The', 'animation', 'truly', 'stroke', 'genius', 'directors', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Christopher', 'Miller', 'passion', 'piece', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'made', 'film', 'love', 'letter', 'childhood', 'enjoyable', 'beginning', 'end.Emmett', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'ordinary', 'guy', 'erm', '8230', 'Lego', 'figurine', 'Bricksburg', 'any-city-USA', 'who', 'declared', '8216', 'special', '8217', 'help', 'Wyldstyle', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Vitruvius', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'save', 'world', 'evil', 'dictator', 'who', 'everyone', 'good', 'guy', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'who', 'know', 'truth.The', 'plot', 'isn', '8217', 't', 'much', 'different', 'other', '8216', 'chosen', 'one', '8217', 'stories', 'where', 'underdog', 'ultimately', 'day', 'always', 'good', 'message', 'young', 'audiences', 'What', 'really', 'film', 'special', '8217', 's', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'here', 'adults', 'kids', 'script', 'work', 'near-genius', 'lots', 'timely', 'satire', 'biting', 'observations', 'one', 'probably', '8217', 'expect', '8220', 'Lego', 'Movie.', '8221', 'Everyone', 'fictional', 'community', 'Bricksburg', 'rules', 'watch', 'same', 'TV', 'shows', 'everyone', 'else', 'buy', 'overpriced', 'coffee', 'everyone', 'else', 'follow', 'rules', 'made', 'government', 'everyone', 'else', 'government', 'everyone', '8217', 'best', 'interest', 'mind', 'right', 'Even', 'film', '8217', 'annoyingly', 'catchy', 'pop', 'song', '8220', 'Everything', 'Awesome', '8221', '8217', 't', 'what', '8217', 's', 'fascism.Once', 'eyes', 'make', 'adjustment', 'odd', 'yet', 'intoxicating', 'animation', 'style', '8217', 're', 'bound', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', '8220', 'Lego', 'Movie', '8221', '8217', 's', 'really', 'work', 'genius', 'hilarious', 'almost', 'turn', 'sentimental', 'when', 'not', 'condescending', 'fast-paced', 'degree', 'where', 'need', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'catch', 'everything', 'may', 'have', 'missed', 'first', 'time.Grade']",N/A

I also wasn't entirely sure what the point would be.  LEGO is about creativity and exercising your imagination -- which is why it's been so difficult to get a decent Dungeons & Dragons film made -- so what could a movie about LEGO bricks possibly offer?  As it turns out, a lot.First, let's establish that the LEGO company knew who to hire: directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller made the hilarious &#34;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&#34; and Chris McKay created &#34;Robot Chicken.&#34; I repeat: ROBOT. CHICKEN.  The terrifyingly un-PC, uproariously funny, occasionally squirm-inducing Robot Chicken, a show consisting entirely of animation riffing on the pop culture of our youth.  So it's no surprise that &#34;The LEGO Movie&#34; is entertaining for adults.  What is surprising is how it's entertaining for everybody. This was my three-year-old's first film and she loved it, along with my six-year-old, my wife, and of course me.The world revolves around your typical yellow minifig Emmet Brickowoski (Chris Pratt), an everyday construction worker who loves Taco Tuesdays and just wants to fit in.  Much to his dismay, it turns out he's so utterly bland that he is also utterly forgettable...until he stumbles upon the Piece of Resistance, and super-heroine Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) stumbles upon Emmet.  Prophesized by the blind Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) as The Special, Emmet's humdrum life will never be the same.  He is to lead the Master Builders, minifigs who know how to assemble LEGOs, against Lord Business (Will Ferrell) and his Octan Corporation empire. Thing is, Emmet is the least special minifig of all.What ensues is a mind-bending adventure that riffs on everything from &#34;The Matrix&#34; to &#34;Terminator.&#34; With so many worlds to explore, the occasional intrusion of items from real life (always deadly), and a soundtrack that will burn into your skull, it's hard not to enjoy the insanity.  Every piece of pop culture in the world is so trite (ranging from the aforementioned &#34;Everything is Awesome!&#34; song everyone listens to the &#34;Where's My Pants?&#34; television show everyone watches) that it's hard not to laugh at our consumerist culture in spite of the fact that this is a movie which will sell many, many, LEGOs.The film is strikingly earnest and utterly false at the same time, filled with a meta-narrative that is either charmingly quaint or a deep metaphor for the child in all of us.  You could spend all day analyzing its nuances -- it's a movie that you need to own on DVD to get all the in-jokes that are crammed onto the screen -- or you could just go and play with your LEGOs.  Which is exactly what my son did...and he's started building LEGOs in new and creative ways.Everything is awesome indeed.",5,Everything really is awesome,1391904000,"02 9, 2014",2014,2871,"[""'re"", 'big', 'fans', 'LEGO', 'house', 'thought', 'movie', 'featuring', 'LEGO', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'big', 'commercial', 'also', 'was', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'sure', 'what', 'point', 'would', 'be', 'LEGO', 'creativity', 'exercising', 'imagination', 'why', 'been', 'so', 'difficult', 'get', 'decent', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'film', 'made', 'what', 'could', 'movie', 'LEGO', 'bricks', 'possibly', 'offer', 'out', 'lot.First', 'let', 'establish', 'LEGO', 'company', 'knew', 'who', 'hire', 'directors', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Chris', 'Miller', 'made', 'hilarious', '34', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '34', 'Chris', 'McKay', 'created', '34', 'Robot', 'Chicken.', '34', 'repeat', 'ROBOT', 'CHICKEN', 'terrifyingly', 'un-PC', 'uproariously', 'funny', 'occasionally', 'squirm-inducing', 'Robot', 'Chicken', 'show', 'consisting', 'entirely', 'animation', 'riffing', 'pop', 'culture', 'youth', 'surprise', '34', 'LEGO', 'Movie', '34', 'entertaining', 'adults', 'What', 'surprising', 'how', 'entertaining', 'everybody', 'was', 'three-year-old', 'first', 'film', 'loved', 'six-year-old', 'wife', 'course', 'me.The', 'world', 'typical', 'yellow', 'minifig', 'Emmet', 'Brickowoski', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'everyday', 'construction', 'worker', 'who', 'Taco', 'Tuesdays', 'just', 'fit', 'Much', 'dismay', 'out', 'so', 'utterly', 'bland', 'also', 'utterly', 'forgettable', 'Piece', 'Resistance', 'super-heroine', 'Wyldstyle', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Emmet', 'Prophesized', 'blind', 'Vitruvius', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Special', 'Emmet', 'humdrum', 'life', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', 'lead', 'Master', 'Builders', 'minifigs', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'assemble', 'LEGOs', 'Lord', 'Business', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Octan', 'Corporation', 'empire', 'Thing', 'Emmet', 'least', 'special', 'minifig', 'all.What', 'mind-bending', 'adventure', 'everything', '34', 'Matrix', '34', '34', 'Terminator.', '34', 'so', 'many', 'worlds', 'explore', 'occasional', 'intrusion', 'items', 'real', 'life', 'always', 'deadly', 'soundtrack', 'will', 'burn', 'skull', 'hard', 'not', 'enjoy', 'insanity', 'piece', 'pop', 'culture', 'world', 'so', 'trite', 'ranging', 'aforementioned', '34', 'Everything', 'Awesome', '34', 'song', 'everyone', '34', 'Where', 'My', 'Pants', '34', 'television', 'show', 'everyone', 'watches', 'hard', 'not', 'laugh', 'consumerist', 'culture', 'spite', 'fact', 'movie', 'will', 'sell', 'many', 'many', 'LEGOs.The', 'film', 'strikingly', 'earnest', 'utterly', 'false', 'same', 'time', 'filled', 'meta-narrative', 'charmingly', 'quaint', 'deep', 'metaphor', 'child', 'could', 'spend', 'day', 'analyzing', 'nuances', 'movie', 'need', 'own', 'DVD', 'get', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'crammed', 'screen', 'could', 'just', 'go', 'play', 'LEGOs', 'Which', 'exactly', 'what', 'son', 'did', 'started', 'building', 'LEGOs', 'new', 'creative', 'ways.Everything', 'awesome', 'indeed']",N/A
1599735,AIFRJS0H0AA3A,B009NNM77E,Mikhail Kamenskiy,"[98, 118]","First of all, I'd like to speak about the movie itself (especially seeing that most reviews posted at the moment are complaints about the service, not reviews of the movie). LEGO Movie is potentially one of the most innovative animated movies released to date. While the digital LEGO interaction formula was explored before in video games (LEGO Star Wars and multiple sequels that followed), it's the first time we see the potential of digital Legos being used so much in a feature-length animated movie in both 2D and 3D. This movie takes every single thing done with Lego digitally before and takes it to a new level. Not only the environments and the characters are all Lego (obviously), but also, for the first time that I know of, all the environmental and special effects including water, lasers, explosions and what have you are made of Lego as well and modeled and animated in a very convincing and realistic manner. In addition to the high technical level of the movie I'd like to mention that the characters and the plot are also very smart and appealing, and the humor is easy to understand and fun for kids and adults alike. Definitely a movie that will entertain your family, and if you're shopping for the complete, definitive collector's edition of the movie, this edition is potentially the best since it offers you a lot of extras including the 3D edition, the 3D poster, the bonus Lego figurine, etc. Now, of course, if you're *not* looking for an all-inclusive collector's set and would like a simpler and cheaper option, there's a 2D+3D bluray version available from the UK Amazon (not sure why it's not available in the US) and a plain DVD edition is also available at a much lower price from the US Amazon.Now, about the issue that I've had just like everybody else with my previous $29.99 pre-order being canceled. I can see that a lot of people have come here to express their complaints in the form of putting negative reviews for the movie or for the service. While I can absolutely relate to it (and I did feel a bit down the moment I learned about the canceled preorder), I can say that Amazon.com has been *very* understanding and helpful about this problem. I contacted Amazon customer service and they offered me a $10 discount for the new collector's edition which in the end amounted to the same $29.99 that I ordered my previous edition for. As such, not only did Amazon stay true to their pre-order price guarantee (albeit after I had to contact them, of course), but I'll also be a happy owner of this all-inclusive collector's edition at a price of the previous edition which included less items than this one! As such, do not panic and do not give in to the temptation to whine and complain in a review. Instead, carefully consider your desires (whether you want this collector's edition or not) and, if you do, politely explain your situation to Amazon.com and refer them to your previous canceled order. It is a pleasure for me to openly say that Amazon has been very helpful in all the years I've been their happy customer.

1599771,A3VO05LD5WSO9F,B009NNM77E,Robert Hayes,"[0, 0]","THE LEGO MOVIE is a very entertaining, funny and, in the end, rather poignant film that will appeal to kids and adults.  The story is about a nondescript, fit-in-with-the-crowd nobody named Emmett who accidentally happens upon a mythical &#34;Piece of Resistance.&#34; Aided by the Master Builders, he tries to stop the universe from being ruined by Lord/President Business. Having only just watched this now, as it makes its way onto home video, I didn't watch it in theaters although I was aware of the hype and positive reactions to it, both from critics and audiences. However, I must say that I wasn't too impressed with it. The story is rather ho-hum and bland, not unlike the main character is for most of the movie. What kept me invested was all of the in-jokes and pop culture references. Nothing was laugh-out-loud funny, but it did make me chuckle consistently. The best bits were probably from Batman, Superman and Green Lantern (voiced by Will Arnett, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, respectively). Another strong point was the large ensemble voice cast, which included Chris Pratt (Emmett), Will Ferrell (Lord Business), Elizabeth Banks (Wild Side) and Morgan Freeman (Vitruvius/The Wizard?). Despite the rather bland story, things were practically saved near the end when it takes a rather poignant turn which I won't spoil (for the few people who haven't seen it yet). The end makes everything that came before it worth watching. Still, I can't quite bring myself to forgive everything else completely. Among those things is a ridiculously catchy earworm that gets repeated ad nauseam.

We were in a full theatre and one gentleman in particular seemed to be outrageously entertained with his incontinent guffawing. The kids were, of course, entertained enough and the movie had humor working on all levels from the youngest kids to the adults, though nothing REALLY adult, if you get my drift.As to production quality of the movie, I was extremely impressed with the level of visual detail. I had assumed that since the Lego world is, of necessity, rather low resolution, that the movie might be clunky but they didn't shy away from high-definition situations. Seeing Legos animated into an undulating ocean, explosions, fire or billowing smoke and dust was particularly surprising. In a similar vein, if you go see this movie be sure you keep an eye on the stuff going on in the background. I noted several scenes in which what was going on behind the focal point of the camera was at least as entertaining as what was going on in front.Lastly, on the topic of actually learning something, this movie was surprisingly deep. On the surface there was a profound lesson on the value of individuality vs working as a team. Often in children's movies the themes crow constantly about being your own person and doing your own thing but this one has a strong streak teaching the value of working together and accomplishing more than any set of individuals working separately could. Later in the film, parents get a strong admonition about letting kids be kids and practice their individual creativity rather than trying to get kids to fit into strict parental expectations. All in all lot to learn here.In summary, Izzy said, ""Best movie Ever!"" but then she always says that. On my part I wouldn't say best movie ever but it had a lot to say, was technically well executed and featured lots of famous voices that parents will recognize. I'm not sure what more you could want than that.PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great!

1599780,A2TCG2HV1VJP6V,B009NNM77E,Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...,"[5, 7]","It's sad, but as I get older (I'm 17 at the time of this writing), LEGOs just become more and more, dare I say, irrelevant to me. And whenever I see a CGI-animated LEGO cartoon on TV, I just cringe. Where's the appeal in a show that's simply coated in LEGO visuals and doesn't rely on its own potential? However, from the moment I first heard about The LEGO Movie, and saw its first trailer, I was immediately hyped. Backed up by the talented writers of the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs film, this movie managed to not only beat all odds of my expectations, but nukes them! And when I finally got to see it in theaters, I got what I anticipated for and MUCH more!The LEGO Movie doesn't just decorate a generic theme with the LEGO brand. It focuses on a crazy adventure set in LEGO lore (animated in a stop-motion esc style to boot), and goes as far as to poke fun at the LEGO brand itself! The moment we see protagonist Emmet, he follows instructions on how to fit in with life, and later meets up with ""Master Builders"" who can build to their hearts' desires (which, by the way, complements the brand's encouragement to do one or the other) while Emmet's best idea is a Double Decker Couch. Who are these Master Builders, you may ask? Well, to name a few obvious examples, Emmet meets this awesome outsider tomboy-ish girl named Wyldstyle, a blind wise elder named Vitruvius, an incredibly adorable unicorn/cat hybrid appropriately named Unikitty, and FREAKING BATMAN.Yes. Batman is in this movie. But not just any variation of Batman - A full-on parody of the character! Don't get me wrong. Every one of the main characters is equally hilarious and fun to see in his/her own right, but you can't say that Batman does not steal the show considering he's a DC Comics hero in a movie about LEGOs! I bet the writers had a blast writing for Batman, because he's loaded with all sorts of comical characteristics that you would never expect the Dark Knight to be placed under!Many other characters join in on the fun as well, although many licensed ones are merely cameos. Still, it's fun to get brief glimpses of Abraham Lincoln, TMNT's Michaelangelo, The Simpsons' Milhouse, Ninjago's Green Ninja, etc. There's also a small running gag between Superman and the Green Lantern.Speaking of gags, have I forgotten to mention that The LEGO Movie is completely loaded with jokes and gags of all sizes? If I were to dare you to try to go through the movie without laughing, you may lose by the beginning of the movie. Nearly everything in the movie is out there to get you to at least chuckle! Granted, you do still get some emotional scenes (that are nicely executed on their own), but then comes a punchline or event right after that lightens up the mood quickly.I could go on forever about this movie and list out as much as humanly possible, and I'd still not do the movie justice. There's even a severe plot twist that happens later in the movie that is too heart-warming and perfect to give away. No matter what, you need to watch this movie! The characters are extremely funny, the action is epic, the animation is utterly brilliant, the writing is both silly and smart, and....just......EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!",5,Insert three-word exclamation here,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",2014,3213,"['sad', 'get', 'older', ""'m"", '17', 'time', 'writing', 'LEGOs', 'just', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'dare', 'say', 'irrelevant', 'whenever', 'see', 'CGI-animated', 'LEGO', 'cartoon', 'TV', 'just', 'cringe', 'Where', 'appeal', 'show', 'simply', 'coated', 'LEGO', 'visuals', ""n't"", 'rely', 'own', 'potential', 'However', 'moment', 'first', 'heard', 'LEGO', 'Movie', 'saw', 'first', 'trailer', 'was', 'immediately', 'hyped', 'Backed', 'up', 'talented', 'writers', 'Cloudy', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', 'film', 'movie', 'managed', 'not', 'only', 'beat', 'odds', 'expectations', 'when', 'finally', 'got', 'see', 'theaters', 'got', 'what', 'anticipated', 'MUCH', 'more', 'LEGO', 'Movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'decorate', 'generic', 'theme', 'LEGO', 'brand', 'crazy', 'adventure', 'set', 'LEGO', 'lore', 'animated', 'stop-motion', 'esc', 'style', 'boot', 'as', 'far', 'poke', 'fun', 'LEGO', 'brand', 'moment', 'see', 'protagonist', 'Emmet', 'instructions', 'how', 'fit', 'life', 'later', 'up', 'Master', 'Builders', 'who', 'can', 'build', 'hearts', 'desires', 'way', 'brand', 'encouragement', 'do', 'one', 'other', 'Emmet', 'best', 'idea', 'Double', 'Decker', 'Couch', 'Who', 'are', 'Master', 'Builders', 'may', 'ask', 'Well', 'name', 'few', 'obvious', 'examples', 'Emmet', 'awesome', 'outsider', 'tomboy-ish', 'girl', 'named', 'Wyldstyle', 'blind', 'wise', 'elder', 'named', 'Vitruvius', 'incredibly', 'adorable', 'unicorn/cat', 'hybrid', 'appropriately', 'named', 'Unikitty', 'FREAKING', 'BATMAN.Yes', 'Batman', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'variation', 'Batman', 'full-on', 'parody', 'character', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'equally', 'hilarious', 'fun', 'see', 'own', 'right', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Batman', 'not', 'steal', 'show', 'considering', 'DC', 'Comics', 'hero', 'movie', 'LEGOs', 'bet', 'writers', 'had', 'blast', 'writing', 'Batman', 'loaded', 'sorts', 'comical', 'characteristics', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'be', 'placed', 'Many', 'other', 'characters', 'join', 'fun', 'as', 'well', 'many', 'licensed', 'ones', 'are', 'merely', 'cameos', 'Still', 'fun', 'get', 'brief', 'glimpses', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'TMNT', 'Michaelangelo', 'Simpsons', 'Milhouse', 'Ninjago', 'Green', 'Ninja', 'etc', 'also', 'small', 'running', 'gag', 'Superman', 'Green', 'Lantern.Speaking', 'gags', 'have', 'forgotten', 'mention', 'LEGO', 'Movie', 'completely', 'loaded', 'jokes', 'gags', 'sizes', 'were', 'dare', 'try', 'go', 'movie', 'laughing', 'may', 'lose', 'beginning', 'movie', 'Nearly', 'everything', 'movie', 'out', 'there', 'get', 'least', 'chuckle', 'Granted', 'do', 'still', 'get', 'emotional', 'scenes', 'are', 'nicely', 'executed', 'own', 'then', 'punchline', 'event', 'right', 'up', 'mood', 'quickly.I', 'could', 'go', 'forever', 'movie', 'list', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'humanly', 'possible', ""'d"", 'still', 'not', 'do', 'movie', 'justice', 'even', 'severe', 'plot', 'twist', 'later', 'movie', 'too', 'heart-warming', 'perfect', 'give', 'away', 'matter', 'what', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'characters', 'are', 'extremely', 'funny', 'action', 'epic', 'animation', 'utterly', 'brilliant', 'writing', 'silly', 'smart', '.just', 'EVERYTHING', 'AWESOME']",N/A

1599801,A26MJME9IBNETY,B009NNM77E,StrangePegs,"[4, 8]","This will be full of spoilers.First, let me just say, the movie is good. It's a lot of fun and a lot of funny. For pure enjoyment, The Lego Movie did its job. I laughed a lot and so did my kids. The song, &#34;Everything Is Awesome,&#34; is ongoing in my house, now. The actors did a great job with the voices, especially Will Arnett as Batman and Charlie Day as Benny. The animations was great and is full of more details than you can actually while sitting in the theater. Since this is a movie that we will almost certainly buy, I'm looking forward to being able to pause it in order to look for all of the things I missed and read the numerous background signs that whiz past in all of the action.The issue I have with the movie is the story. Or its lack to effectively establish one story.Most of the movie revolves around the story of Emmet Brickowoski, a generic Lego minifigure. He is so generic, in fact, as to be unrememberable. He is devastated to learn that when he went missing no one really noticed that he was gone. He wasn't special in any way. He had nothing that set him apart in any way. Nothing that made people say, &#34;Oh, yeah, that guy!&#34; Which is why he found the idea of being &#34;the special&#34; so appealing. Once he realized that he wasn't, that is.The problem was that Emmet only knew how to follow the rules and didn't know how to do anything without his instruction book. Because he has become the subject of the prophecy, they need to teach him how to be &#34;the special,&#34; which really doesn't go well. He has no imagination and is unable to come up with anything beyond his &#34;bunk couch&#34; idea. Eventually, though, he does begin show some capacity to lead and, just as he is beginning to get into his role as &#34;the special,&#34; his mentor is killed and reveals that there never really was a prophecy: He just made it up. Before dying, though, he tells Emmet that all he needs to do to be special is to decide to be special. Basically, he can do it if he just believes in himself.That's fine as the message of a movie. I mean, it's a pretty common message for movies. &#34;All you need to do to succeed is to believe in yourself.&#34; You can't be special if you don't think you are. Personal feelings about that message aside, Emmet doesn't fall for it. He's devastated to learn that there is no &#34;special&#34; and that he's not it. He does make the move, though, to save his friends, specifically Wyldstyle, and sacrifices himself to the void to free them.And ends up in the real world. Our world. Where the movie and the message change and, really, completely undermine the original message.Once we get out into the real world we find that the actual conflict is between a boy and his father. The father believes in doing everything by the instructions, and the boy wants to build his own things. The father's Lego sets are off limits to his son, which is the issue, as we come to find out. While his father was at work, the boy has &#34;wrecked&#34; his father's stuff by rebuilding the rather miraculous sets into the story we've been watching. The conflict is about the rigidity of the father and whether the boy should be allowed to play with his father's toys.Very little of the movie dealt with what was actually the ultimate story and conflict (and the one that my children resonated with, by the way), but it is the point of the movie. And I will leave the outcome of that unspoiled.However, in dealing with that conflict, the father dismisses Emmet as &#34;just a construction worker.&#34; A nobody. Which reveals to us why the character is so not special. However, the son responds, &#34;No, Dad, he's the hero.&#34; Which reveals to us that Emmet actually cannot be special just because he decides to, just because he believes in himself. He is special because he was chosen to be special by the son. And that is the issue I have with the movie. It sets up this whole story about being special and believing in yourself and how that's all you really need but, then, says, &#34;Never mind. You have to be chosen.&#34; Of course, they don't come out and say that, but, still, it's there.So, from a story-telling perspective, the movie has some structural flaws. Despite that, though, as I said, it's very enjoyable, and, really, most people won't notice what I'm talking about anyway or feel any conflict from it. And, well, there's a great Lego Star Wars cameo. Being a Warner Bros. movie, the Marvel franchise was, unfortunately, left out.

Make no mistake: The Lego Movie (2014) is immersed in marketing, but that is secondary because the filmmakers wisely and creatively keep the film's heart intact.  The Lego Movie may prove to be the best film of the year and, in its second run, can be seen for less than the price of  an actual Lego. That is a far better spend than putting a second mortgage down for most of the first-run dreck we are inundated with.The Lego Movie is a pop culture manifesto, composed of wall-to-wall references and jokes that come at you fast and furious. Yet, the in-jokes are so judiciously worked into the fantasy at large that they leave you smiling instead of spinning. This was no doubt helped by the writing/directing team of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. The duo clearly were inspired by the level of imagination found in the long-popular toy. It is remarkable what a mere two artists can do, as opposed to committee-style filmmaking. Lord and Miller began their collaboration with the cult series ""Clone High"" (2002) and continued to the big screen with Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs (2009) and 21 Jump Street (2012).  In addition to the writing/directing team, what makes The Lego Movie so winning is the personality to be found in plastic.As a mystic toy, Morgan Freeman spoofs his pious screen persona, and his sense of joy in doing so is contagious. Equaling Freeman in voice work is Chris Pratt as the protagonist construction worker Emmett; Elizabeth Banks as Wyldstyle; Will Arnett as Batman; Alison Brie as Unikitty; and Liam Neeson as GoodCop/Bad Cop. A smorgasbord of high- and pop-culture characters make appearances, from Abraham Lincoln (Will Forte) and Shakespeare (Jorma Taccone) to Wonder Woman (Cobie Smulders).Brick City is a universe in its own right and it absorbs everything that came before it with shrewd wit, including Star Wars (with Billy Dee Williams and Anthony Daniels reprising their respective roles). The Lego Movie even does the impossible: it makes George Lucas' characters fun again. The animation here is among the most innovative since the golden age of Disney and the Fleischer Brothers. It is also delightfully weird. It sometimes seems as if Busby Berkeley has risen from the dead, been given an orange plastic brick and an unlimited budget and let loose.Emmett is the much-needed, flawed little guy hero, and probably the best example we have seen of the type since Wall-E or The Iron Giant. We root for him, as opposed to Batman (and after the last Batman movie, why would anyone cheer the caped crusader)? Yet, here in The Lego Movie even Batman is unexpectedly fresh. Even better: amidst all the dazzling effects, the viewer genuinely hopes that two pieces of plastic, Emmett and Wyldstyle, will interlock.The most surprising thing, in a movie chock full of surprises, is the glorification of the individual over the status quo corporation. One would hardly expect such a ""Piece de Resistance"" from a giant manufacturer. Even Will Ferrell rises to the occasion, giving an all too rare good performance as the evil President Business of unfettered capitalism.Reportedly, over four million digitalized lego images were used in the film, which would seem an invitation for disaster. The production not only pulls it off, but does so with shocking precision through all that hyperkinetic color splashing. The last act of The Lego Movie takes an unexpected route, and one may fear the worst, but the filmmakers pull off yet another surprise, giving us that rarity of all rarities in animated films: an ending which should not be given away.This is an epic film whose narrative commendably refuses to take the well worn dumbed-down path so often prevalent in movies of this type. Its minuscule flaw may be that it is overly ambitious, but proves a welcome retreat from the plethora of excrement that is bankrupt in ambition. The Lego Movie pulls off the impossible:  it restores some faith in the imaginative and creative potential of the medium, at least for 101 minutes.* My review originally appeared at 366 weird movies.",5,"A POP CULTURE MANIFESTO, chock full of surprises and a triumph for all.",1403136000,"06 19, 2014",2014,4136,"['Usually', 'movies', 'toys', 'are', 'merely', 'excuse', 'mass', 'merchandising', 'Make', 'mistake', 'Lego', 'Movie', '2014', 'immersed', 'marketing', 'secondary', 'filmmakers', 'wisely', 'creatively', 'keep', 'film', 'heart', 'intact', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'may', 'prove', 'be', 'best', 'film', 'year', 'second', 'run', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'less', 'price', 'actual', 'Lego', 'far', 'better', 'spend', 'putting', 'second', 'mortgage', 'down', 'most', 'first-run', 'dreck', 'are', 'inundated', 'with.The', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'pop', 'culture', 'manifesto', 'composed', 'wall-to-wall', 'references', 'jokes', 'come', 'fast', 'furious', 'in-jokes', 'are', 'so', 'judiciously', 'worked', 'fantasy', 'large', 'leave', 'smiling', 'instead', 'spinning', 'was', 'doubt', 'helped', 'writing/directing', 'team', 'Phil', 'Lord', 'Christopher', 'Miller', 'duo', 'clearly', 'were', 'inspired', 'level', 'imagination', 'found', 'long-popular', 'toy', 'remarkable', 'what', 'mere', 'two', 'artists', 'can', 'do', 'opposed', 'committee-style', 'filmmaking', 'Lord', 'Miller', 'began', 'collaboration', 'cult', 'series', 'Clone', 'High', '2002', 'continued', 'big', 'screen', 'Cloudy', 'A', 'Chance', 'Meatballs', '2009', '21', 'Jump', 'Street', '2012', 'addition', 'writing/directing', 'team', 'what', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'winning', 'personality', 'be', 'found', 'plastic.As', 'mystic', 'toy', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'spoofs', 'pious', 'screen', 'persona', 'sense', 'joy', 'doing', 'so', 'contagious', 'Equaling', 'Freeman', 'voice', 'work', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'protagonist', 'construction', 'worker', 'Emmett', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Wyldstyle', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'Batman', 'Alison', 'Brie', 'Unikitty', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'GoodCop/Bad', 'Cop', 'A', 'smorgasbord', 'high-', 'pop-culture', 'characters', 'make', 'appearances', 'Abraham', 'Lincoln', 'Will', 'Forte', 'Shakespeare', 'Jorma', 'Taccone', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Cobie', 'Smulders', '.Brick', 'City', 'universe', 'own', 'right', 'absorbs', 'everything', 'came', 'shrewd', 'wit', 'including', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Billy', 'Dee', 'Williams', 'Anthony', 'Daniels', 'reprising', 'respective', 'roles', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'even', 'impossible', 'George', 'Lucas', 'characters', 'fun', 'again', 'animation', 'here', 'most', 'innovative', 'golden', 'age', 'Disney', 'Fleischer', 'Brothers', 'also', 'delightfully', 'weird', 'sometimes', 'Busby', 'Berkeley', 'risen', 'dead', 'been', 'given', 'orange', 'plastic', 'brick', 'unlimited', 'budget', 'let', 'loose.Emmett', 'much-needed', 'flawed', 'little', 'guy', 'hero', 'probably', 'best', 'example', 'have', 'seen', 'type', 'Wall-E', 'Iron', 'Giant', 'root', 'opposed', 'Batman', 'last', 'Batman', 'movie', 'why', 'would', 'anyone', 'cheer', 'caped', 'crusader', 'Yet', 'here', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'even', 'Batman', 'unexpectedly', 'fresh', 'Even', 'better', 'amidst', 'dazzling', 'effects', 'viewer', 'genuinely', 'two', 'pieces', 'plastic', 'Emmett', 'Wyldstyle', 'will', 'interlock.The', 'most', 'surprising', 'thing', 'movie', 'chock', 'full', 'surprises', 'glorification', 'individual', 'status', 'quo', 'corporation', 'One', 'would', 'hardly', 'expect', 'such', 'Piece', 'de', 'Resistance', 'giant', 'manufacturer', 'Even', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'occasion', 'giving', 'too', 'rare', 'good', 'performance', 'evil', 'President', 'Business', 'unfettered', 'capitalism.Reportedly', 'four', 'million', 'digitalized', 'lego', 'images', 'were', 'used', 'film', 'would', 'seem', 'invitation', 'disaster', 'production', 'not', 'only', 'off', 'so', 'shocking', 'precision', 'hyperkinetic', 'color', 'splashing', 'last', 'act', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'unexpected', 'route', 'one', 'may', 'fear', 'worst', 'filmmakers', 'pull', 'off', 'yet', 'surprise', 'giving', 'rarity', 'rarities', 'animated', 'films', 'ending', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'given', 'away.This', 'epic', 'film', 'narrative', 'commendably', 'take', 'well', 'dumbed-down', 'path', 'so', 'often', 'prevalent', 'movies', 'type', 'minuscule', 'flaw', 'may', 'be', 'overly', 'ambitious', 'welcome', 'retreat', 'plethora', 'excrement', 'bankrupt', 'ambition', 'Lego', 'Movie', 'impossible', 'faith', 'imaginative', 'creative', 'potential', 'medium', 'least', '101', 'minutes', '*', 'My', 'review', 'originally', 'appeared', '366', 'weird', 'movies']",N/A

I thought it was a clever idea to have almost two movies/storylines fused into one movie.  You have the Lego Movie (created by the boy) and then you have the boy playing with his father&#8217;s Lego&#8217;s in the real world as a secondary plot.  I know some people didn&#8217;t enjoy this movie that much, but I felt that it was entertaining.  And even if I didn&#8217;t enjoy it, which I did, my kids loved it, which is the most important thing.  The movie is full of action, is humorous, and has a good ending and message.  I also liked how the premise of the movie reminded me of a friend I had growing up.  His mother, who by that time must have been in her forties, had a huge Barbie doll collection in her basement filled with the works (beach houses, penthouses, cars, accessories, etc&#8230;).  Her only rule in regards to the collection was that if you entered the basement, you didn&#8217;t touch anything.  Her rule was strictly enforced too.  I should know.  I found myself kicked out a few too many times.  This is relatively the same premise for the movie.  Will Ferrell creates a massive Lego collection in his basement full of towers, skyscrapers, and all different types of constructions.  His son, who only wants to play with them, sneaks into the basement and begins playing with them before his father makes the constructions permanent through the use of crazy glue (which becomes the main theme in the boy&#8217;s fantasy play world, playing with all of the Lego&#8217;s).  I&#8217;d recommend this movie to both adults and kids as it has a good message and is pretty entertaining.T.S.

Instead, Amazon suggested this set as an alternative.  If the rest of the dopes bothered to read the email in its entirety and do a little research, they would have discovered that that it was WARNER HOME VIDEO that CANCELED this release, NOT FLIPPING AMAZON.Here's what happened: Warner had already planned for the original releases that we pre-ordered well before the film was released in theaters.  They knew they would have a hit on their hand but were unprepared for how big of a hit it would become. So, they scrambled to do a bunch of market research regarding this new set and discovered that consumers OVERWHELMINGLY preferred it to the original Blu-ray/3D Blu-ray/DVD/Digital (and Blu-ray/DVD) release which was made available only SEVEN days after the film was released.Amazon DIDN'T screw you (if you want to call it that, anyway), Warner Home Video screwed you.Someone said, &#34;I guess I'll just go somewhere else&#34;Sure, you can go somewhere else... and buy the EXACT SAME SET AMAZON IS OFFERING BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THAT'S GOING TO BE RELEASED FOR THIS TITLE FOR AMAZON AT MOST RETAILERS. Target is the ONLY retailer to offer the standard Blu-ray/DVD combo as it's their exclusive. Again, blame Warner, NOT Amazon.&#34;Now we have to do this again for a more Expensive 3D version .....?&#34;NO... As noted by the CAREFULLY WORDED product description, the 3D disc is a BONUS.  So, if you don't like it, TAKE IT UP WITH WARNER HOME VIDEO, NOT AMAZON.You slobs are lucky that Amazon is such a decent company that they gave us all a $10 credit (or better in some cases) to purchase this when they were under no obligation to do so because they did nothing wrong.  WARNER changed their mind, ya dopes, and the fact of the matter is that the set would probably have been down to what you paid for the set you initially pre-ordered by relase day anyway, or something close to it.  I already had a $10 credit applied to my account over a customer service issue so I was able to apply the code and get $20 off, so score for me and if it goes down by release day I'll be paying even less than $20 for it.Bait and switch?  Please. You people are embarrassing.ORIGINAL FILM REVIEW POSTED ON THE ORIGINAL PRE-ORDER SET:Please note, this is a review for the film only. Today's date is February 14, 2014 and at the time of this review, this film had only been in theaters for one week and the 3D Blu-ray/Blu-ray/DVD/Ultraviolet home video release was only available for preorder.It is a rare event that I give a film a perfect score but if there was ever a film that was more deserving in recent memory, I can't think of one. The LEGO Movie is by far the best animated film I have ever seen and that includes ANY Pixar film (yes, I know... blasphemy). It is also the first film I have seen in years in which the entire audience stood up and applauded when the credits rolled.Cleverly acted, the film showcases the comedic talents and sometimes surprising comedic talents of some of the biggest names in popular film today. Will Farrell (Lord Business/President Business) and Will Arnett (Batman/Bruce Wayne)... heck, those guys are givens as far as comedic timing is concerned but who knew that Morgan Freeman and Liam Neeson could be so funny?From the beginning, the story seems like nothing more than a rehash of the themes in Kung Fu Panda or The Matrix with the role of Po/Neo taken on by our very ordinary hero, Emmet (Chris Pratt). As the film progresses, it takes on the tone and plot of a million of other action film clich&eacute;s but the visually stunning frenetic action combined with multiple clever pop-culture references allows you to forgive what seems like a generic story and just simply enjoy the awesome adventure that you and your kids are on. The level of detail is absolutely phenomenal, right down to the tiny scratches in the ABS plastic and my favorite, the visible finger prints on the minifigures themselves. And make no mistake, by design, this film was meant to be seen by families which just makes the experience that much more enjoyable.So, am I saying that the overall experience of the film makes up for the weak story? Nope. In the last 20 minutes of the film there are live-action sequences that tie the whole story together and turn what was a generic and almost mediocre plot into one of the most brilliant pieces of complex fantasy story-telling I have ever seen in a family film. It was so cleverly done that I literally slapped myself in the forehead for being tricked like I was because the film drops not-so-subtle clues as to the big twist throughout its entirety.I came out of this film realizing that though cleverly marketed as a kid's film, this is a nostalgia film for X and Y Geners (is that a word? don't care, going with it...) and the tell was with 1980s Spaceman, the insanely hyperactive Benny (voiced by Charlie Day).Anyone whoever had this minifigure (or a similar one with the space helmet) knew that within a month's time of taking that helmet off repeatedly, the bottom of the helmet near the chin would split because it was so thin. The reason for this is simple: it was a two part injection-molded piece of plastic and that thin little piece was right on the seam. The fact that someone thought of this very esoteric detail in and of itself is not only brilliant but it also helps achieve one of the film's main goals: taking our generation back to a time when we were seven years-old. The level of violence in this film is probably the biggest factor in the MPAA PG rating, but it's the exact same kind of violence that a seven year-old kid would inflict on their own LEGO minifigures through normal imagination-fueled play and like everything else in the film, it ties into the big twist that brings the whole film together.Is The LEGO Movie, as some have claimed, just a two-hour advertisement for a toy? Yep, but who cares? LEGO toys are a permanent part of our pop-culture and certainly no different than film franchises based on G.I. Joe or Transformers... except for the fact that I can watch a LEGO film with my kids and not scare the living crap out of them. The motivations for this film are irrelevant as to its quality despite the cynical attitudes towards it.My only regret is that we didn't see it in 3D as this is one film that it is a moral imperative to see in 3D. Oh, well... I guess we'll just have to go see it again. Everything is awesome, indeed.",5,STOP BLAMING AMAZON FOR WARNER HOME VIDEO'S MARKETING DECISIONS (Info.

1599822,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B009NNM77E,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect with THE LEGO MOVIE. The previews I had seen about the film weren&#8217;t all that impressive. However, I have seen some of the Lego Star Wars and Lego Batman shorts and found them highly entertaining and humorous. I had also read some really positive reviews about THE LEGO MOVIE from some movie critics I respect. Overall, I found the movie to be highly entertaining, but tainted with disappointment.THE LEGO MOVIE revolves around an ordinary construction worker named Emmett Brickowoski (Chris Pratt). Emmett is just a typical worker. His favorite show is &#8220;Honey, Where Are My Pants,&#8221; his favorite song is &#8220;Everything Is Awesome,&#8221; he does everything by the instruction manual, and he thinks President Business (Will Ferrell) is a great guy. Unbeknownst to average citizens like Emmett, President Business is actually an evil mastermind known as Lord Business who not only wants to rule the world, but wants to permanently change it to fit his tastes. All of the Master Builders of the world are hiding in secret. But there is a prophecy that there will be a &#8220;special&#8221; Builder who will find the &#8220;piece de resistance&#8221; and stop Lord Business. After being smitten by Wyldstylde (Elizabeth Banks), Emmett has an accident and ends up discovering the &#8220;piece de resistance&#8221; and is caught up in a war between the Master Builders and Lord Business. He&#8217;s joined on his quest by a blind sorcerer named Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman), Batman (Will Arnett), a happy strange looking cat named Unikitty (Alison Brie), a 1980s spaceman named Benny (Charlie Day), and Wyldstyle.What I was most impressed about with THE LEGO MOVIE was the humor and the special effects. The Lego shorts and cartoons are usually very funny and THE LEGO MOVIE is no different. However, the humor in THE LEGO MOVIE is moved up a couple of notches. There are layers of humor scattered throughout. At one moment there&#8217;s a one-liner joke that the kids will appreciate and the next second there&#8217;s a reference from something in classical literature being thrown in. The jokes and laughs keep up a constant and steady stream throughout the movie, but the humor never drags the story down.As for the special effects, I was amazed at how just about everything in THE LEGO MOVIE world looked like it was made from Legos. Not including the strange offshoot the movie takes in the third act and some random artifacts from a different world, everything in THE LEGO MOVIE actually looks like it&#8217;s made from Legos: from shower bubbles, to water, to lasers. Almost everything in THE LEGO MOVIE looks like it is part of a Lego world.In terms of story and plot, THE LEGO MOVIE is a really well written film. It could have a crash and chintzy commercial, but it&#8217;s not. The movie is filled with messages about using one&#8217;s own talents, believing in yourself, working together as a team, why you shouldn&#8217;t be consumed by pride, and the importance of family. Despite all of this I was disappointed by the switch-up in the plot during the movie&#8217;s final act. I don&#8217;t want to give too much away, but during the final act of the movie, the story veers off into a completely different direction. Granted, in the hands of lesser screenwriters and filmmakers, this part of the movie would have come off as complete schmaltz, but in THE LEGO MOVIE it does not. However, this last section of the movie left me feeling a little bit cheated and disappointed. I wanted to see how the characters in the movie would solve their own crisis, but instead was given a deux es machina finale. THE LEGO MOVIE is a good movie, but the film&#8217;s final act is what keeps it from being an &#8220;awesome&#8221; movie.Overall, THE LEGO MOVIE is a highly entertaining movie that will appeal to people of all ages and is truly a family movie. It&#8217;s full of great humor and has some extraordinary special effects. Just beware that you&#8217;ll either love the movie&#8217;s last act or it will be something that makes the movie a little bit disappointing.",4,Emmett Is Awesome,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,4122,"['wasn', '8217', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'previews', 'had', 'seen', 'film', 'weren', '8217', 'impressive', 'However', 'have', 'seen', 'Lego', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Lego', 'Batman', 'shorts', 'found', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'humorous', 'had', 'also', 'read', 'really', 'positive', 'reviews', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'movie', 'critics', 'respect', 'Overall', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'tainted', 'disappointment.THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'ordinary', 'construction', 'worker', 'named', 'Emmett', 'Brickowoski', 'Chris', 'Pratt', 'Emmett', 'just', 'typical', 'worker', 'favorite', 'show', '8220', 'Honey', 'Where', 'Are', 'My', 'Pants', '8221', 'favorite', 'song', '8220', 'Everything', 'Awesome', '8221', 'everything', 'instruction', 'manual', 'President', 'Business', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'great', 'guy', 'Unbeknownst', 'average', 'citizens', 'Emmett', 'President', 'Business', 'actually', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'known', 'Lord', 'Business', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'rule', 'world', 'permanently', 'change', 'fit', 'tastes', 'Master', 'Builders', 'world', 'are', 'hiding', 'secret', 'prophecy', 'will', 'be', '8220', 'special', '8221', 'Builder', 'who', 'will', 'find', '8220', 'piece', 'de', 'resistance', '8221', 'stop', 'Lord', 'Business', 'being', 'smitten', 'Wyldstylde', 'Elizabeth', 'Banks', 'Emmett', 'accident', 'up', 'discovering', '8220', 'piece', 'de', 'resistance', '8221', 'caught', 'up', 'war', 'Master', 'Builders', 'Lord', 'Business', '8217', 's', 'joined', 'quest', 'blind', 'sorcerer', 'named', 'Vitruvius', 'Morgan', 'Freeman', 'Batman', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'happy', 'strange', 'looking', 'cat', 'named', 'Unikitty', 'Alison', 'Brie', '1980s', 'spaceman', 'named', 'Benny', 'Charlie', 'Day', 'Wyldstyle.What', 'was', 'most', 'impressed', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'was', 'humor', 'special', 'effects', 'Lego', 'shorts', 'cartoons', 'are', 'usually', 'very', 'funny', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'different', 'However', 'humor', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'moved', 'up', 'couple', 'notches', 'are', 'layers', 'humor', 'scattered', 'one', 'moment', 'there', '8217', 's', 'one-liner', 'joke', 'kids', 'will', 'appreciate', 'next', 'second', '8217', 's', 'reference', 'something', 'classical', 'literature', 'being', 'thrown', 'jokes', 'laughs', 'keep', 'up', 'constant', 'steady', 'stream', 'movie', 'humor', 'never', 'story', 'down.As', 'special', 'effects', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'just', 'everything', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'world', 'looked', 'was', 'made', 'Legos', 'Not', 'including', 'strange', 'offshoot', 'movie', 'third', 'act', 'random', 'artifacts', 'different', 'world', 'everything', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'actually', '8217', 's', 'made', 'Legos', 'shower', 'bubbles', 'water', 'lasers', 'Almost', 'everything', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'part', 'Lego', 'world.In', 'terms', 'story', 'plot', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'really', 'well', 'written', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'crash', 'chintzy', 'commercial', '8217', 'not', 'movie', 'filled', 'messages', 'using', 'one', '8217', 'own', 'talents', 'believing', 'working', 'together', 'team', 'why', 'shouldn', '8217', 'be', 'consumed', 'pride', 'importance', 'family', 'was', 'disappointed', 'switch-up', 'plot', 'movie', '8217', 'final', 'act', 'don', '8217', 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'final', 'act', 'movie', 'story', 'veers', 'off', 'completely', 'different', 'direction', 'Granted', 'hands', 'lesser', 'screenwriters', 'filmmakers', 'part', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'complete', 'schmaltz', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'not', 'However', 'last', 'section', 'movie', 'left', 'feeling', 'little', 'bit', 'cheated', 'disappointed', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'characters', 'movie', 'would', 'solve', 'own', 'crisis', 'instead', 'was', 'given', 'deux', 'es', 'machina', 'finale', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'good', 'movie', 'film', '8217', 'final', 'act', 'what', 'being', '8220', '8221', 'movie.Overall', 'THE', 'LEGO', 'MOVIE', 'highly', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'will', 'appeal', 'people', 'ages', 'truly', 'family', 'movie', '8217', 'full', 'great', 'humor', 'extraordinary', 'special', 'effects', 'Just', 'beware', '8217', 'love', 'movie', '8217', 's', 'last', 'act', 'will', 'be', 'something', 'movie', 'little', 'bit', 'disappointing']",N/A

1599825,A1AST6JNBJ95VC,B009NNM77E,Victory,"[2, 3]","Everything in this movie is awesome!  Just like the tune says.Here's my take on what's so awesome about it:Think it's a movie about business and ""corporations"" being bad?  Think again.Think it's about a regular guy becoming a hero?  Not quite.Think it's about reaching WAAAY deep down inside and finding that inner special something and building that up to something big and superhuman?  Not really.  The main hero makes something pretty plain and never really transforms into a ""Luke Skywalker"" savior of the galaxy.This movie breaks so many Hollywood rules I just love it!  Individuality is important.  Team work is important.  Yes we all know that.  But this movie first makes you think team work is cool, then you realize you lose your individuality by being on a team.  Then you meet the super creative builders and think Emmet should become one of them.  But they're SUCH individuals that they can never work together on a team like Emmet.  Furthermore, Emmet just doesn't have the creativity to be like them.  So what's a mundane Joe Blow supposed to do?Answer:  Build.  Just build.Maybe you're the next da Vinci.  Great.  We need da Vincis.  But even the guys who build ""useless"" double decker couches are important.  Why?  Because somebody will come along and turn your ""useless"" creation into a life saving, history changing thing.  While the da Vincis of the world are wrapped up in things like cold fusion, warp drives, and world peace the Emmets of the world build the small inventions that may stay small and still wonderful but may also work their way to greatness via an Invisible Hand of human interaction.  Maybe that person who makes that connection and builds that masterpiece is a da Vinci, but maybe he's just another Emmet with another average idea that combined with your idea creates something truly wonderful.Create.  That is the message of the movie.  Create.I love this movie and I'm 45 years old.  I'm an engineer and I've owned Lego Mindstorms for a couple of years now.  The movie has not only spurred me to build silly, ridiculous, playful things again but I've also introduced my little two year old daughter to Duplo and she loves it and I love playing with her.

1599826,A4YXKE5F62II8,B009NNM77E,Visual Bureau,"[15, 21]","Oh, what a relief it is to see one of the finest visual constructions in animation in recent memory.While this may be an overstatement, it is fair to say that the people who made this knew that they wanted to articulate the movements and mechanics of Lego toys through computer animation and digital input of faces to make animated faces into what are relatively still figures.As a result, &#8220;The Lego Movie&#8221; is a strong sell for families, children and animation enthusiasts, and it has the strongest mechanical input in an animated film I have witnessed since the 2009 film &#8220;Fantastic Mr. Fox&#8221; and the 2011 film &#8220;Rango.&#8221;While my banter about the look and style may not explain much about the story, the film revolves around an ordinary Lego construction worker, Emmet, voiced by Chris Pratt, who eventually encounters Wyldestyle, a roguish young woman, voiced by Elizabeth Banks, trying to find the alleged Piece of Resistance.They end up in a run from the law as a mega-tyrant, President Business, voiced by Will Ferrell, also tries to make his henchmen find the Piece of Resistance.The story accompanying the frenetic action scenes and animation is a good part to the story which reveals something special toward the climax which will not be spoiled here, but has to do with something metaphorical.In addition, the humor and self-referential nature of the film reminded me of something from a &#8220;Simpsons&#8221; episode made for a younger set, and the &#8220;Saturday Night Live&#8221; vibe I have been getting with the voice talent did not overwhelm or annoy me.The 3D effects in the film accompanying the animation are very strong and did not feel gimmicky considering the scheme here renders it to look like stop-motion &#8212; not regular computer animation.While that is an expensive investment for regular moviegoers to spend $3 to $4 more for 3D, 3D only works for me on rare circumstances.In most cases, it is often the documentary or stop-motion films that do not have too much digital post-production work.An action film tends to work for me, and from previous experience, &#8220;The Lego Movie&#8221; is the best use of 3D in animation since &#8220;Coraline&#8221; and &#8220;ParaNorman.&#8221;What drew me to this film was not only the animation scheme and mechanics, but the sense of nostalgia and appreciation that I once had for these brick toys as a child.This same kind of enthusiasm has not occurred that much since I saw &#8220;The Simpsons Movie&#8221; back in 2007.However, I will admit, I did not want to spoil myself with marketing and publicity for &#8220;The Lego Movie,&#8221; as it might have made me have a different opinion about the film.If I had seen too much advertising, I possibly would have had a lukewarm reaction.Animal Logic, the Australian animation and digital effects company behind this film, should congratulate themselves for rendering such dynamic visuals that are not only tangible, but also cleverly done.Congratulations to directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller for spearheading this project that is more in tune with Lego dynamics than many of those Bionicle and Cartoon Network Lego short films would ever be.It looks like stop-motion, and there are rules to abide by when you follow this kind of mechanical function with the figures.If you feel animation has rather twiddled its thumbs, that will change when you go see &#8220;The Lego Movie.&#8221;You will not be disappointed.",5,One of the most mechanically intriguing animated films released in recent years.
