He made some genuine films and this is another one that will thrill the JD enthusiast.Set in LA and Alaska, John takes on the bootleggers of Alaska after becoming frustrated with corporate FBI procedures. He turns gritty and still keeps that John Denver appeal that we all grew up with. While this movie was released 20 years ago on CBS, it withstands those two decades as genuine entertainment. He only sings one song but it is part of the movie's plot and not a solo cutaway.Get it while you can, it probably will be a limited release and end up on ebay at some point.",5,John Denver Gets Tough in Alaska,1230336000,"12 27, 2008",2008,701,"[""'m"", 'happy', 'one', 'John', 'Denver', 'TV', 'movies', 'being', 'released', 'officially', 'rather', 'backroom', 'counter', 'thing', 'made', 'genuine', 'films', 'one', 'will', 'thrill', 'JD', 'enthusiast.Set', 'LA', 'Alaska', 'John', 'bootleggers', 'Alaska', 'becoming', 'frustrated', 'corporate', 'FBI', 'procedures', 'gritty', 'still', 'John', 'Denver', 'appeal', 'grew', 'up', 'movie', 'was', 'released', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'CBS', 'two', 'decades', 'genuine', 'entertainment', 'only', 'one', 'song', 'part', 'movie', 'plot', 'not', 'solo', 'cutaway.Get', 'can', 'probably', 'will', 'be', 'limited', 'release', 'end', 'up', 'ebay', 'point']",Higher Ground

1207935,A2LC8OZEYOSUAY,B001KEHAGC,"D. Perl ""Dragon""","[3, 6]","Higher Ground is not a great movie and not a poor movie.  It is simply about a woman who loses her faith in Jesus.  She can no longer feel the presence of God in her body or in her life.  Though the film is not a blatant attack against Christianity, it does have some messages regarding religion.  Fear is the driving force behind religious belief.  Candy coat it however one may, there are many threats that keep the faithful in line.Another message is that bad things happen to people regardless of faith.  Bad things happen to good people.  It is a bad event that causes the main character to question her faith, and threats of hell fire (from some of her peers) to try to get her back in line.The movies depicts religious people as brainwashed zombies who must follow the advice of senior members or suffer the consequences.  Overall, the film was depressing and had no answers regarding faith.  The characters in the film did not seem like happy people.  They were a self-hating fundamentalist group who speak of how they deserve nothing good in life for being terrible people.  God is all good and they are all bad.  In other words, without God they are worse than nothing.All in all, the film shows how life can be when people are unable to think for themselves.",3,The Message?,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1269,"['Higher', 'Ground', 'not', 'great', 'movie', 'not', 'poor', 'movie', 'simply', 'woman', 'who', 'faith', 'Jesus', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'feel', 'presence', 'God', 'body', 'life', 'film', 'not', 'blatant', 'attack', 'Christianity', 'have', 'messages', 'regarding', 'religion', 'Fear', 'driving', 'force', 'religious', 'belief', 'Candy', 'coat', 'however', 'one', 'may', 'are', 'many', 'threats', 'keep', 'faithful', 'line.Another', 'message', 'bad', 'things', 'happen', 'people', 'regardless', 'faith', 'Bad', 'things', 'happen', 'good', 'people', 'bad', 'event', 'main', 'character', 'question', 'faith', 'threats', 'hell', 'fire', 'peers', 'try', 'get', 'back', 'line.The', 'movies', 'religious', 'people', 'brainwashed', 'zombies', 'who', 'must', 'follow', 'advice', 'senior', 'members', 'suffer', 'consequences', 'Overall', 'film', 'was', 'depressing', 'had', 'answers', 'regarding', 'faith', 'characters', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'happy', 'people', 'were', 'self-hating', 'fundamentalist', 'group', 'who', 'how', 'deserve', 'nothing', 'good', 'life', 'being', 'terrible', 'people', 'God', 'good', 'are', 'bad', 'other', 'words', 'God', 'are', 'worse', 'nothing.All', 'film', 'how', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'when', 'people', 'are', 'unable', 'think']",Higher Ground

1207937,A2KWQ64TRHB3YH,B001KEHAGC,Israel Drazin,"[1, 2]","This film depicts the religious life of a small seemingly undereducated tightly-knit community of somewhat strange looking men and women. The main focus is on a woman who is married to a man who feels that his child was saved by a miracle and who decides to devote his life to Jesus. He drags his wife into this spiritual life.The two and their children belong to a church whose pastor and his wife teach simple religious ideas based for the most part of the need to have faith and love Jesus even though it seems that he is not responding to prayers. The woman begins to realize that she is not getting anything out of her faith. We see her struggles and her reactions when a person she loves is not helped by her faith.The woman is thoughtful, but I understand the film to say that she doesn't resolve her problem. Viewers should look at the film themselves and decide if she finds solace and if so how, and if not why not. It seems to me that she fails because she only focuses on faith and receiving answers to her prayers. She does not delve deeply into what religion really is and is not helped by the simple teachings of her pastor and his associates who would be unable to answer her questions. She decides to read books, but the books that she reads are poetry about love and good novels that tell a lot about life, but each focuses on one aspect and none address why one should be religious, how to do so, what to avoid doing, and the benefits that religion can and cannot produce.",4,A film that raises questions but does not answer them,1337644800,"05 22, 2012",2012,1491,"['film', 'religious', 'life', 'small', 'seemingly', 'undereducated', 'tightly-knit', 'community', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'looking', 'men', 'women', 'main', 'focus', 'woman', 'who', 'married', 'man', 'who', 'child', 'was', 'saved', 'miracle', 'who', 'devote', 'life', 'Jesus', 'wife', 'spiritual', 'life.The', 'two', 'children', 'church', 'pastor', 'wife', 'teach', 'simple', 'religious', 'ideas', 'based', 'most', 'part', 'need', 'have', 'faith', 'love', 'Jesus', 'even', 'not', 'responding', 'prayers', 'woman', 'realize', 'not', 'getting', 'anything', 'faith', 'see', 'struggles', 'reactions', 'when', 'person', 'not', 'helped', 'faith.The', 'woman', 'thoughtful', 'understand', 'film', 'say', ""n't"", 'resolve', 'problem', 'Viewers', 'should', 'look', 'film', 'decide', 'solace', 'so', 'how', 'not', 'why', 'not', 'only', 'faith', 'receiving', 'answers', 'prayers', 'not', 'delve', 'deeply', 'what', 'religion', 'really', 'not', 'helped', 'simple', 'teachings', 'pastor', 'associates', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'unable', 'answer', 'questions', 'read', 'books', 'books', 'are', 'poetry', 'love', 'good', 'novels', 'tell', 'lot', 'life', 'focuses', 'one', 'aspect', 'none', 'address', 'why', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'religious', 'how', 'do', 'so', 'what', 'avoid', 'doing', 'benefits', 'religion', 'can', 'can', 'not', 'produce']",Higher Ground

There, his partner gets involved with some shady smugglers and when he's found dead, Jim spearheads the investigation.This TV movie was a pilot for a series.  It's entertaining enough, with an exciting plot and nasty bad guys.  The problem is John Denver was a wonderfully talented singer but not a strong actor.  He struggles to deliver his lines and isn't believable as an agent. His awkwardness contrasts greatly with the experience of his costars Martin Kove and John Rhys-Davis.  Denver does shine when singing the lilting title song and a rousing ode to Alaska.  His fans won't mind his self-conscious acting, but I can understand why this wasn't picked up as a series.The movie does have a well-written script and beautiful Canadian scenery, and those who loved John Denver will find the scenes of him flying his little plane will tug at the heartstrings.

1207939,A1TEPFS8EGMJP1,B001KEHAGC,Lone Wolf,"[5, 5]","I bought this dvd partly because i'm a big John Denver fan & partly because the reviews of it here on Amazon were overwhelmingly good. I unfortunately missed it back in 1988 when it was on tv but I am really glad I took a chance &  bought it cuz it's one of Denver's best movies. It's also a real treat to see him playing a former FBI agent in the wilds of Alaska who while investigating the murder of his best friend & partner, gets to fly around in cool seaplanes as part of the shipping business that he's working in. His investigation rubs a few locals & the sherriff (John Rys-Davies) the wrong way at first but they quickly start to see that his character is smart, tenacious & not someone to be taken lightly. Along with the good story there is teriffic scenery & a good cast as well. You even get to see John sing & play guitar during a party scene. The highlight of this film isn't the music, story or gorgeous scenery though.  It's actually getting to see John do the thing he loved to do the most when he wasn't entertaining all us lucky fans, and that was flying airplanes. Obviously there is a bittersweet quality to this but it's still great to see John having a great time & know all the while, that at the very least, he died doing the thing he most loves to do.",4,John Denver Fans Will Love This One,1249430400,"08 5, 2009",2009,1278,"['bought', 'dvd', 'partly', 'i', ""'m"", 'big', 'John', 'Denver', 'fan', 'partly', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'were', 'overwhelmingly', 'good', 'unfortunately', 'missed', 'back', '1988', 'when', 'was', 'tv', 'am', 'really', 'glad', 'took', 'chance', 'bought', 'one', 'Denver', 'best', 'movies', 'also', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'playing', 'former', 'FBI', 'agent', 'wilds', 'Alaska', 'who', 'investigating', 'murder', 'best', 'friend', 'partner', 'fly', 'around', 'cool', 'seaplanes', 'part', 'shipping', 'business', 'working', 'investigation', 'few', 'locals', 'sherriff', 'John', 'Rys-Davies', 'wrong', 'way', 'first', 'quickly', 'start', 'see', 'character', 'smart', 'tenacious', 'not', 'someone', 'be', 'taken', 'lightly', 'good', 'story', 'teriffic', 'scenery', 'good', 'cast', 'well', 'even', 'get', 'see', 'John', 'sing', 'play', 'guitar', 'party', 'scene', 'highlight', 'film', ""n't"", 'music', 'story', 'gorgeous', 'scenery', 'actually', 'getting', 'see', 'John', 'do', 'thing', 'loved', 'do', 'most', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'entertaining', 'lucky', 'fans', 'was', 'flying', 'airplanes', 'Obviously', 'bittersweet', 'quality', 'still', 'great', 'see', 'John', 'having', 'great', 'time', 'know', 'while', 'very', 'least', 'died', 'doing', 'thing', 'most', 'loves', 'do']",Higher Ground
