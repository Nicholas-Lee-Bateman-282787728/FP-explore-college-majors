Remarkable storytelling with original cast - and the kids have grown up! We still watch all three on special occasions.

It completes the story line very well.

837838,A1635YKA4UAXVY,B0002JNRFE,Earl James,"[1, 2]","Very predictable story.  In the forty some reviews for the VHS there are a lot of comments on bad acting.  I agree, but the bad acting is not from the 3 main adult characters.  Parts of story not very believable.  They've gotten along for years, then all of a sudden the father is tripping on items in his  barn that he's worked in for decades.  Everyone's near death, but manages to survive.  Plus no characters look like people back then would have looked.  More like California actors.",2,"Barely watchable,  highly predictable",1287705600,"10 22, 2010",2010,488,"['Very', 'predictable', 'story', 'forty', 'reviews', 'VHS', 'are', 'lot', 'comments', 'bad', 'acting', 'agree', 'bad', 'acting', 'not', '3', 'main', 'adult', 'characters', 'Parts', 'story', 'not', 'very', 'believable', ""'ve"", 'gotten', 'years', 'then', 'sudden', 'father', 'tripping', 'items', 'barn', 'worked', 'decades', 'Everyone', 'death', 'survive', 'characters', 'look', 'people', 'back', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'More', 'California', 'actors']",N/A
