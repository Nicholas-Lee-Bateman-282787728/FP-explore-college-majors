561923,A102ZELP840AUD,B00004ZBHC,Avid Reader,"[0, 0]","First rented because D'Onfrio fan + the plot sounded interesting. Only 1 local video store had it at the time, and I guess few people saw it. What a shame since it is uplifting and insightful as well as very, very funny, with great characters/performances at all levels. OK, some of the humor is kinda gross at times, but not gratuitously. Lots of the laughs are for wit and insight into the human condition&#8230;  So glad I now have my very own copy because it's a film to share with friends or play now and then to lighten your mood. Such a hoot to see Barney Miller's Max Gail as an Oregon pot grower!Only disappointment -- lack of DVD extras. Released too much later for a &#34;Making of&#8230;&#34; but surprised no interviews with or commentaries by D'Onofrio, Hines, Max Gail, etc. Would love them to have asked James Earle Jones why he took this bit role when he was long since such a big star. Would gladly buy another copy for such extras and donate this one, tax-deductible, to my local library so more people could enjoy it.",5,Rare & hysterical/moving film at a low price,1387411200,"12 19, 2013",2013,1037,"['First', 'rented', 'because', ""D'Onfrio"", 'fan', '+', 'plot', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'Only', '1', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'had', 'time', 'guess', 'few', 'people', 'saw', 'What', 'shame', 'uplifting', 'insightful', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'very', 'funny', 'great', 'characters/performances', 'levels', 'OK', 'humor', 'kinda', 'gross', 'times', 'not', 'gratuitously', 'Lots', 'laughs', 'are', 'wit', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', '8230', 'glad', 'now', 'have', 'very', 'own', 'copy', 'film', 'share', 'friends', 'play', 'now', 'then', 'lighten', 'mood', 'hoot', 'see', 'Barney', 'Miller', 'Max', 'Gail', 'Oregon', 'pot', 'grower', 'Only', 'disappointment', 'lack', 'DVD', 'extras', 'Released', 'too', 'much', 'later', '34', 'Making', '8230', '34', 'surprised', 'interviews', 'commentaries', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Hines', 'Max', 'Gail', 'etc', 'Would', 'love', 'have', 'asked', 'James', 'Earle', 'Jones', 'why', 'took', 'bit', 'role', 'when', 'was', 'long', 'big', 'star', 'Would', 'gladly', 'buy', 'copy', 'such', 'extras', 'donate', 'one', 'tax-deductible', 'local', 'library', 'so', 'more', 'people', 'could', 'enjoy']",N/A
561924,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B00004ZBHC,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[11, 11]","I bought this because when Gregory Hines recently died I wanted to see those movies he did that I had missed. Perhaps a poor reason, but better late than never. He was an accomplished actor and dancer. This DVD has a great price on it as well for the entertainment you will get out of it. I was pleasantly surprised. This is one of those feel good sleepers you run across now and then.When Hines, playing a paraplegic, decides to enlist the aid of a blinded football star, played by D' Onofrio, to win a white water race, anything can happen. The friendship that develops is earned through hard work and the realization that no matter what, we can move forward with our lives.Fans of movies like ""Brian's Song"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""Cool Runnings"", and ""Amazing Grace"" should enjoy it. Other than some ocassional bad language the movie is suitable for most the family.",3,Heart Warmer,1064880000,"09 30, 2003",2003,867,"['bought', 'when', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'recently', 'died', 'wanted', 'see', 'movies', 'did', 'had', 'missed', 'Perhaps', 'poor', 'reason', 'better', 'late', 'never', 'was', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'dancer', 'DVD', 'great', 'price', 'as', 'well', 'entertainment', 'will', 'get', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'one', 'feel', 'good', 'sleepers', 'run', 'across', 'now', 'then.When', 'Hines', 'playing', 'paraplegic', 'enlist', 'aid', 'blinded', 'football', 'star', 'played', 'D', 'Onofrio', 'win', 'white', 'water', 'race', 'anything', 'can', 'happen', 'friendship', 'earned', 'hard', 'work', 'realization', 'matter', 'what', 'can', 'move', 'forward', 'lives.Fans', 'movies', 'Brian', 'Song', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'Amazing', 'Grace', 'should', 'enjoy', 'Other', 'ocassional', 'bad', 'language', 'movie', 'suitable', 'most', 'family']",N/A

I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 for the bathroom and sexual language which didn't wind down until the end, which renders it a non-children & family movie. still i didn't find it vulgar, and i don't like profanity and vulgarity in movies. It worked for this one, though. but hey! Ollie was mad at life. He had everything going for him - a famous and beloved football player and wham! a violent tackle leaves him blind. Gregory Hines was excellent as a wheel-chair bound guy who determines to help Ollie who is making a fool of himself with all his mad-at-life antics. Besides, he needs a compadre to help him enter a white water rafting contest - yes, 2 disabled guys which is what makes this more interesting as the story proceeds.The people they meet along the way while traveling to the town that sponsors this contest is what makes this movie great - the cafe waitress, the bar-room gadfly, and the ex-football player turned pot farmer. All  give excellent portrayals. This movie was a sleeper that didn't get the credit it is due.

D'Onofrio brings his method acting to the movie playing a very believable blind ex-football player. He and Gregory Hines have a nice chemistry in a very feel-good movie.,5,Who knew that Vincent D'Onofrio could be so funny,1356652800,"12 28, 2012",2012,255,"['movie', 'poignant', 'hysterical', 'worth', 'crab', 'fishing', 'scenes', 'alone', ""D'Onofrio"", 'method', 'acting', 'movie', 'playing', 'very', 'believable', 'ex-football', 'player', 'Gregory', 'Hines', 'have', 'nice', 'chemistry', 'very', 'feel-good', 'movie']",N/A

From beginning to end, this is an ""adult"" fun film.  There are a number of raunchy moments that only D'Onofrio could make seem real and necessary, and which only Gregory Hines could field with compassion and dignity!This is the story of two misfits who together don't quite ever make a whole... but who are delightful to tag along with.  It's really hard not to get caught up in their adventures.  Right to the final scenes, it's just too funny!  The secret to the film is that it is composed of characters that are every-day folks, and don't we really enjoy watching ourselves?This is a five star film.  Very enjoyable.
