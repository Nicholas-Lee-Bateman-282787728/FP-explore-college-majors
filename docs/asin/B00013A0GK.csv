Partly because of the relaxed happy style in which it was produced, and partly because of the range of practices available. As one reviewer said, the vinyasas between poses are a bit fast for my liking, but you can always pause the DVD. The tragically/magically hips section is excellent; you will feel great afterwards. A range of people showing modifications helps. Nice garden scenery as a relaxing backdrop.If like me, you don't like too much navel gazing interfering with your yoga, this is just the right touch.",5,Itinerant Kiwi,1159660800,"10 1, 2006",2006,576,"['own', 'quite', 'few', 'yoga', 'DVDs', 'now', 'favourite', 'Partly', 'relaxed', 'happy', 'style', 'was', 'produced', 'partly', 'range', 'practices', 'available', 'one', 'reviewer', 'said', 'vinyasas', 'poses', 'are', 'bit', 'fast', 'liking', 'can', 'always', 'pause', 'DVD', 'tragically/magically', 'hips', 'section', 'excellent', 'will', 'feel', 'great', 'afterwards', 'range', 'people', 'showing', 'modifications', 'Nice', 'garden', 'scenery', 'relaxing', 'backdrop.If', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'too', 'much', 'gazing', 'interfering', 'yoga', 'just', 'right', 'touch']",Power Yoga for Happiness with Eoin Finn

If you want to do American Yoga...fast,fast,fast...then this is the practice for you. For me, Eoin progresses thru the poses way too fast and with urgency in his voice. He barely pauses in between poses and you never really makes a mind/body connection. If you just want to burn and sweat, this power yoga is for you (and they smile a lot). The scenery is beautiful and the people make it interesting, but it wasn't for me.I've tried his routine several times, but I always turn it off part way through -- he irritates me more than anything. It could be considered a good buy because it includes 2 DVDs. It has many different lengths of workouts, but these different workouts are just cut and spliced, so they're not really different styles or performances.If you want a real challenging Yoga experience where you can practice and learn mind/body/breath connections, I would suggest Kripalu Yoga DVD instead.

It might be a little to much, but the workouts are good. There are some pretty advanced variations, but nobody needs to go that far.I personnaly feel that Eoins Skills are not as high as some of the other Teachers that I saw on DVD. He is strong and does some advanced mooves, but his basics are sometimes not so fluid and sure as you see it with Great Teachers like Shiva Rea and Baron Baptiste.

791902,A159M3CTAQJ19V,B00013A0GK,Life Enthusiast,"[4, 4]","I've had this yoga DVD for about a year and I am finally writing a review because it has turned out to be one of my best yoga DVD's out of a really huge collection.  It really gives you great value, you can keep returning to it and increasing your overall state of health, and your strength, balance and best of all your energy will continue to grow as you keep coming back to it.It offers 2 full DVD's of a power yoga, vinyasa flow routine that is cut up into different versions.  Unlike other DVD's that try to do this kind of thing each version is really well balanced and will stretch you out and make you feel great.  There's 1) 30 min. routine ""quickie"" 2) 40 min. ""daily dose of bliss"" 3) 55 min. ""magically hips"" 4) 53 min ""strong,happy and free"" and 5) the full 80 min. ""total happiness"" version.  The beautiful outdoor location w/grass and trees in Vancouver and the friendly, fun, and calm demeanor of Eoin and the other practitioners give you a whole range of choices so that you really will get a great, balanced, strenthening, toning, flexibility-improving workout every single time.  Within each version he offers about three different options for the more difficult poses so that you can keep returning to this DVD set and getting improvement, or doing the quick version on a day when you don't have a lot of time or energy but still want great benefits.  You do continue growing and getting stronger and more fit as you use these DVD's so it is really a program that keeps on giving.Don't get me wrong, it is five versions of the same routine so unlike ""Yoga Shakti"" by Shiva Rea you don't have that amount of differences, but this is not another static DVD that you can only use as a beginner or once you are already super-fit.  It's a wonderful DVD set.  I hope people keep enjoying this.

The podcasts cover a range of about 6 years. Eoin's skill as a teacher and prowess as a yogi has grown quite a bit over the past six years. I find the same is true with his DVDs. The first one I bought is the most recent: Power Yoga For Happiness II The Surf Edition. After owning that for a month, I bought this one, Power Yoga For Happiness.It is a good, solid workout. If you love vinyasa yoga/power yoga, you'll probably like this DVD. For me, it was good and solid, but didn't contain any of the really funky variations of his later work.And for clarity purposes, there is one workout on this DVD. It's 80 minutes long. All the other workouts are different chapters of the main workout put together with certain things left out to make shorter flows.The thing I love about Eoin is that he is just so filled with love, playfulness and joy. That comes through in this DVD, but it comes through even more in Power Yoga For Happiness II The Surf Edition.

That's fine with me and that's how the Surf Edition is too.I really like this instructor though the deal with this one is there is nothing new to me on here.  There are a few cool things and one part he goes into some more advanced postures, but without any explanation.  He's like ""put your leg here,"" and that's about all he says.  So I think he has gotten better with instruction in his newer dvds.  In this one he seems to have more of an ego or maybe just that ""Bryan Kest"" way about him, like sort of showing off a little.

This one met my very strict standards for several reasons.  It truly is appropriate for all ability levels.  Whether I'm looking to challenge myself or experience a very light, soothing session I can follow this sequence.  Eoin is very soothing and encouraging.  His cuing is spot-on and in several cases showed me a new way of looking at some of the poses.  A few of the things he says are really unusual (like when he says ""it should feel like you're getting ice cream licked off your body"" in pigeon).  Typically that would distract me but, it works with Eoin and just makes me smile and enjoy the experience even more.The two discs offer selections from the full routine.  I love the ""quickie;"" it's only 30 minutes and is a perfect end to my day.  ""Strong, free, and happy"" is another favorite that challenges and energizes me.This video truly is ""for happiness.""
