This movie was the best of the rest. Nothing took Jurassic park movies from it's 1st place, but the second place is definitely for this movie.The story was okay, because it is hard to believe in a place where dinosaurs somehow survived. Not just one or 2 of them, but plenty of species, including flying ones. And as soon as we have them it is hard to believe that this will remain a secret for long. The movie has a potential, and there could be done a second sort of chapter for the movie.Acting was great and actors were good. Did not fell in love with any of them and I think the son and father relationship was a little too much. I mean I did not like it. Sure that shows a picture of who is who, but I still think it was just too much.Dinosaurs models are just good, not just some bad CGI models, but they are really good, when comparing them to other dinosaur movies.I would give the movie 4 stars if not the twisted (sort of) ending. I found myself with lots of questions on what will happen next, and I enjoyed the twist (the last 10 minutes) more, than the rest of the movie. It sort of got me right there.Also there is a relationship with dinosaur, that really made the movie stand out. It's not something I expected to see and like. Usually it's bad CGI models that I see in other movies, but here it was not the same.I'm upset that this movie is not on blu-ray yet or even dvd region 1 (though I use region 1 &2 dvds). The reason for that is that even though IMDB gave it a low rating, like plenty of times before I find myself in situation when I either believe the ratings and miss the movie or I watch it anyway. I am glad I did not look at IMDB ratings before I finished the movie. I suddenly got really upset when I saw them.Do yourself a favor and do not read any ratings and reviews for the movie. Just buy it and see for yourself.I am an experienced movie watcher. I love plenty of movies, and when I say this is not a bad movie, I really mean it.",5,"This is not a Jurassic Park, but...",1350691200,"10 20, 2012",2012,2180,"['definitely', 'best', 'dinosaur', 'movie', 'Jurassic', 'Park.J.P', 'was', 'first', 'step', 'making', 'ultimate', 'dinosaur', 'movie', 'intelligent', 'perfect', 'give-away', 'atmosphere', 'movies', 'are', 'eye-candy', 'movie', 'was', 'best', 'rest', 'Nothing', 'took', 'Jurassic', 'park', 'movies', '1st', 'place', 'second', 'place', 'definitely', 'movie.The', 'story', 'was', 'okay', 'hard', 'believe', 'place', 'where', 'dinosaurs', 'somehow', 'survived', 'Not', 'just', 'one', '2', 'plenty', 'species', 'including', 'flying', 'ones', 'as', 'soon', 'have', 'hard', 'believe', 'will', 'remain', 'secret', 'long', 'movie', 'potential', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'second', 'sort', 'chapter', 'movie.Acting', 'was', 'great', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'Did', 'not', 'fell', 'love', 'think', 'son', 'father', 'relationship', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'mean', 'did', 'not', 'Sure', 'picture', 'who', 'who', 'still', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'much.Dinosaurs', 'models', 'are', 'just', 'good', 'not', 'just', 'bad', 'CGI', 'models', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'when', 'comparing', 'other', 'dinosaur', 'movies.I', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'not', 'twisted', 'sort', 'ending', 'found', 'lots', 'questions', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'enjoyed', 'twist', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'more', 'rest', 'movie', 'sort', 'got', 'right', 'there.Also', 'relationship', 'dinosaur', 'really', 'made', 'movie', 'stand', 'not', 'something', 'expected', 'see', 'like', 'Usually', 'bad', 'CGI', 'models', 'see', 'other', 'movies', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'same.I', ""'m"", 'upset', 'movie', 'not', 'blu-ray', 'yet', 'even', 'dvd', 'region', '1', 'use', 'region', '1', '2', 'dvds', 'reason', 'even', 'IMDB', 'gave', 'low', 'rating', 'plenty', 'times', 'find', 'situation', 'when', 'either', 'believe', 'ratings', 'miss', 'movie', 'watch', 'anyway', 'am', 'glad', 'did', 'not', 'look', 'IMDB', 'ratings', 'finished', 'movie', 'suddenly', 'got', 'really', 'upset', 'when', 'saw', 'them.Do', 'favor', 'do', 'not', 'read', 'ratings', 'reviews', 'movie', 'Just', 'buy', 'see', 'yourself.I', 'am', 'experienced', 'movie', 'watcher', 'love', 'plenty', 'movies', 'when', 'say', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'really', 'mean']",The Dinosaur Project

This team of explorers come across a Jurassic world that is inhabited by creatures which civilization has figured were extinct for millions of years. This is their story.Normally, I despise these type of movies..the 'found footage' movies we see so very much of. Most of them end up being shaky messes with little to no scares and excitement, whatsoever. However, someone out there must be listening because this is the second or third 'found footage' movie that I've seen that has, actually, been worth my time. I will admit that there were times during the movie where it was absolutely boring and predictably things would happen...but, for the most part, it was good. Everyone gave good performances and the CGI took center stage in this movie. Don't let the majority fool you into thinking this movie is a waste of time because it isn't. The Dinosaur Project kinda reminded of a lighter version of the Jurassic Park movies. Maybe that is why I like the movie, I don't really know, but I enjoyed it and am glad I purchased it.Of course, I feel this movie would've reach a broader audience if it were filmed as a regular movie and not as a 'found footage' one.  That has to be my biggest gripe about it. That and the fact that Luke keeps bellyaching and whining about his dad so much(it was downright annoying).

I guess it's hard to put to rest a worn out gimmick that has definitely worn out its welcome.  What makes this copycat even worse, is the inclusion of many cameras (one is even strapped to a dinosaur!).  At one point, you have a guy filming a guy who's filming a team at work.  They also over peppered the opening sequence with a series of news reports slapped together in a half hazard fashion.  Add to this barrage a kid who loves to film himself while he talks to THE world.  He even films himself stowing away and getting caught stowing away!  Naturally, this whole mess is ""found"" footage riddled with blackouts no less.  There's nothing duller than many dark moments.I can understand the need for a film crew to film this luckless expedition, but explain the unwanted kid who just happens to have a ton of these little cams that apparently can stick to anything and record.  That's either providence, an overblown ego desperate to film every inch of his life, or lousy/lazy scriptwriting.  The sad thing is, without the unnecessary stunt of found footage, this could have been a nice little adventure movie.The trouble with found footage is the inherent difficulty of getting around a single viewpoint.  Hammering the film with a bunch of little cameras filming many vantage points, makes one wonder, who was editing this footage as they went traipsing through the jungle?I would have kept this movie had it not been just another crappy found footage joke.

1554591,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B008JENBLO,Micheal Hunt,"[3, 6]","Just watching the trailer didn't make me think this was going to be a good movie at all, but there was nothing better to watch at the moment. So, I guess if you're here reading this, and haven't seen the movie yet, you probably are asking yourself if it's worth seeing, or possibly is it worthy of sitting on your shelf next to Jurassic Park? The answer is ...*drum roll*.... nope.If you where like me, and noticed the trailer showed very few scenes of dinosaurs, and mostly showed a few long shots with flying bat-o-saurs in the distance, then noticed the one close up shot for a brief second showed some lame CGI creations, then you probably did or will go into this movie with low expectations. Let me tell you now, if you already have those feelings, you won't kick yourself for defying curiosity and just skipping this movie all together.So the plot is a team has been sent into Africa somewhere to find out if random sightings and stories about Dinosaurs roaming the jungle are true, or just a hoax. The team consists of the usual candidates... the leader explorer guy who has a million missions under his belt and expects to find nothing. The kid who wasn't supposed to go, but tags along anyway and causes the usual ""I wanted to come, but if I didn't, there would be no interest for the teenagers to possibly watch this film"", the one who says, ""We can't go there, it's forbidden and cursed blah, blah, blah, and of coarse a bunch of nobodies who get picked off one by one"".So the helicopter this group is being flown into the jungle with is knocked out of the sky and luckily everyone survives. How convenient. Even more convenient is it crashed almost on top of their destination. A small village where natives live. But something isn't right, no ones around, but heck, don't call for help or anything, just stay the night in those huts and wait for what did it to come back. They do! That's not a spoiler tho, as you can probably guess this is not a movie where a group of explorers stay in small huts and wait to die. After some running and screaming, things settle down as the group gets deeper into the jungle, find a few puppies and feed them candy and what not... always good to make friends with a new species as you never know when they will help you out of the danger that you brought yourselves. I'm trying not to expose a spoiler, but WHO THE HECK DECIDED ONE OF THE EXPLORERS SHOULD GO NUTS AND TURN MICHAEL MYERS ON EVERYONE?Anyway... the start was interesting, the middle was OK, the ending was awful. I don't want to reveal spoilers, but had the ending not have been what it is, it might have been somewhat decent. If they wanted to end it the way it is, then maybe they should have shown it as the Dinosaurs where not there, they where ghosts and they didn't show up on film, people there just thought they saw what they saw, that at least would be somewhat of a twist and a clever-ish ending, but instead they did what they did here, and it's a lame, cheap way to end a cheaply made movie.I won't give the movie 0 stars; It's watchable from start to finish, the acting was not that bad, the shots where bearable, even on the handheld views, and no, it's not the CGI i'm saying makes it lame, it was the plot of this thing that creates lame characters you don't care about, and lame events that just bring the movie down more and more as it goes along until you just hate the ending that stops short with no big climax to finish it off. I think what it is that I didn't like the most was the balance of what it was doing and trying to do, but not working one bit what-so-ever. They introduce a part here, that sets up a part there, but not in a clever way, nor does it pay off. Then this happens here, and what's it got to do with the rest after that? It's like they attempted to make little connections here and there, but the pay off to see it, well, ya couldn't care less and it was a major let down if you even did tie them together.By the way, what the heck are the flying things in this? They looked like something made up on a computer rather than something based on an actual dinosaur. What where they, giant prehistoric bats? When you go into a dinosaur movie, you at least want to see a dinosaur that is modeled on a real one don't you? Not a bunch of things that looked like a vampire transformed halfway between a bat and a Wizard of Oz flying monkey. Speaking of let downs, check out the cover of this movie. If we're seeing the same one, the one with a T-rex behind 3 of the actors of this film.... well, if you expect to see that T-Rex, boy will you be sorely disappointed. In this whole thing, I think 3 or 4 species of supposed Dinosaurs are used. However if you loved Yoshi from Super Mario Bros (movie) then you are gonna love the CGI insults of that creation, with their big kitten eyes and wagging puppy tongues. Oh how cute... no, wait, in a thriller Dinosaur movie? This isn't Barney... I expected one of the Dinosaurs in this film to grab a frying pan and whack someone over the head with it and say in Elmo's voice, ""Not da Momma"". Probably would have earned the film a 4 star rating had they done that! Least I'd know they knew they weren't making a serious film to be respected for realism.Overall; many people will dismiss my review because they want to see it anyway, but then, when you do, you can remember this review and heed I told you so.You will then probably kick yourself if you purchased this movie in anyway. Ain't worth seeing again, ain't a keeper either. Certainly far from the worst movie of all time, I mean, you can watch it from start to finish with only a few hesitations of thinking maybe something is better on TV right now... but a second time viewing? Nah, not without some personal reason to check out something no one else but yourself cares about.I give this a lonely, dateless, short-armed, sexually frustrated Tyrannosauruses-Rex double claws

Jonathan (Richard Dillane) is the leader of the group, while his undisciplined electronic whiz son Luke (Matt Kane) comes along as a stowaway.

Luke's at home stationary mounted camera shakes, zooms, and pans on its own. I think this would have been a better production if they were to have a limited use of this hand held genre within the film.

Directed by Sid Bennett (""Prehistoric Park""), ""The Dinosaur Project"" (his feature debut) is a mildly entertaining adventure film, though I suspect the film would have been better without the narrative device that has been overused in the film industry these days.The story is a standard one with stock characters you have seen somewhere else. A British expedition team led by an adventurous zoologist Jonathan Merchant (Richard Dillane) travels deep into the Congo jungle looking for ""mokele mbembe,"" legendary creature that has been recently sighted. (The legend itself really exists.) However, an accident happens, and the remaining members including Jonathan's trouble-making son Luke (Matt Kane) get stranded in the middle of the jungle.""The Dinosaur Project"" employs a shaky documentary-looking style, trying to increase realism, but I think the film does it too often. The on-location photography (shot in South Africa) is beautifully done, and the special effects of creatures are decent, but the story is uninteresting and the direction uninspired. Characters, especially annoying Luke, sometimes do incredibly stupid things. Feeding a little dinosaur is not something you are supposed to do when lost in the Congolese jungle.The film is mindless fun, but obviously it needs something more than clich&eacute;d storyline. The camcorder-type shooting alone is not enough to make a truly interesting adevnture movie when most audiences are getting more and more cynical about the technique.
