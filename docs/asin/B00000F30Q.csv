In this movie he was shot in the back of the head.  If they are going to get a major detail like this wrong, how well will they document the small details?Mr. Johnny Cash did a convincing job as Frank, the educated book reading brother, who liked to swear at his mules.  Mr. Kris Kristofferson was fun to watch as the rebel who liked excitement, Jesse.  Mrs. June Carter Cash was a delight and a real surprise in the role of their mother.  There is something comforting in her mannerisms, that I just can not pinpoint or explain.  Mr. Willie Nelson played an important role as a former military man (I can not remember his title.) who showed up at the end of the movie, briefly.  His whole time on the screen was no more than a few minutes.  I am surprised that they even put his picture on the box.This movie has a specific target audience.  It does well to hold their interest.  I'll give it 3.75 stars.",4,A good movie worth at least one viewing,1191888000,"10 9, 2007",2007,1023,"['movie', 'was', 'entertaining', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'how', 'accurate', 'was', 'told', 'Jesse', 'was', 'shot', 'back', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'back', 'head', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'major', 'detail', 'wrong', 'how', 'well', 'will', 'document', 'small', 'details', 'Mr', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'did', 'convincing', 'job', 'Frank', 'educated', 'book', 'reading', 'brother', 'who', 'liked', 'swear', 'mules', 'Mr.', 'Kris', 'Kristofferson', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'rebel', 'who', 'liked', 'excitement', 'Jesse', 'Mrs.', 'June', 'Carter', 'Cash', 'was', 'delight', 'real', 'surprise', 'role', 'mother', 'something', 'comforting', 'mannerisms', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'pinpoint', 'explain', 'Mr.', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'played', 'important', 'role', 'former', 'military', 'man', 'can', 'not', 'remember', 'title', 'who', 'showed', 'up', 'end', 'movie', 'briefly', 'whole', 'time', 'screen', 'was', 'more', 'few', 'minutes', 'am', 'surprised', 'even', 'put', 'picture', 'box.This', 'movie', 'specific', 'target', 'audience', 'well', 'hold', 'interest', ""'ll"", 'give', '3.75', 'stars']",The Last Days of Frank & Jesse James

497131,A36VI4D8V3B03T,B00000F30Q,Ernie McHone,"[1, 1]","The James Gang has emerged as one of the most notorious outlaw gangs in American History. For years, Frank and Jesse James stayed one step ahead of the law, and were never caught.Country music superstars Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson are the title characters. Both were pioneers in the country music outlaw movement and play their roles with not only charm but a lot of heart as well. I must say that I've always been fans of their music, and this film is one of the best adaptions of the James tale.We all know how the story ends, and this film takes us about six years before the death of Jesse James and a little while thereafter. Does Frank James get his revenge on the coward that murdered his brother? Just watch and see!

497134,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B00000F30Q,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[9, 13]","As much as you might want to renew your affection for Johny Cash in the wake of Walk the Line, steer clear of this movie. It will bring you up right quick on the limitations of Cash, Kristofferson and country music. Kristofferson can act but Cash is essentially playing himself as the family man with a guilt-ridden past. Sadly it's Cash that has to carry the movie.The James gang was a nasty brutal bunch of murderers, and beyond one killing motivated by revenge, you really don't get the brutality. It's all the myth of Jesse James. He's a good ol' boy that just didn't like losing the Civil War. He's also dead shortly after the halfway mark of the movie.The rest of the movie is about Frank James (Johny Cash) standing trial (he's acquitted - but Willie Nelson gets to testify on his behalf) and wondering if he should go after the man that killed his brother. Another actor (like Clint Eastwood) would have given a nuanced performance of the tensions between wanting revenge and knowing that the dead pretty much had it coming. Cash is just Cash.Buy only if you are a diehard fan of Cash (he only sings on the credits) or really really curious, but be prepared to be disappointed.",3,Even by TV movie standards this is pretty bad,1141948800,"03 10, 2006",2006,1185,"['As', 'much', 'might', 'want', 'renew', 'affection', 'Johny', 'Cash', 'wake', 'Walk', 'Line', 'steer', 'clear', 'movie', 'will', 'bring', 'up', 'right', 'quick', 'limitations', 'Cash', 'Kristofferson', 'country', 'music', 'Kristofferson', 'can', 'act', 'Cash', 'essentially', 'playing', 'family', 'man', 'guilt-ridden', 'past', 'Sadly', 'Cash', 'carry', 'movie.The', 'James', 'gang', 'was', 'nasty', 'brutal', 'bunch', 'murderers', 'one', 'killing', 'motivated', 'revenge', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'brutality', 'myth', 'Jesse', 'James', 'good', 'ol', 'boy', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'losing', 'Civil', 'War', 'also', 'dead', 'shortly', 'halfway', 'mark', 'movie.The', 'rest', 'movie', 'Frank', 'James', 'Johny', 'Cash', 'standing', 'trial', 'acquitted', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'testify', 'behalf', 'wondering', 'should', 'go', 'man', 'killed', 'brother', 'actor', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'tensions', 'wanting', 'revenge', 'knowing', 'dead', 'pretty', 'much', 'had', 'coming', 'Cash', 'just', 'Cash.Buy', 'only', 'are', 'diehard', 'fan', 'Cash', 'only', 'credits', 'really', 'really', 'curious', 'be', 'prepared', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Last Days of Frank & Jesse James
