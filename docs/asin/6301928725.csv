272811,A3QNER0M9CJ22N,6301928725,"Anna Robb ""SaraShaw""","[0, 0]","The movie starts with a stockbroker working in Boston. Andrew. Andrew looks to be 35 or so. I could not get over how mature and stock brokerish he seemed. The problem, Andrew has gotten himself involved with the mob and when it appears that one of Andrew's friends is going to go to the Feds... the friend is killed and Andrew is put into protective custody.  Alas, the protection is not that good and after almost getting killed himself.. Andrew runs and escapes by the skin of his teeth. As a child this scene thrilled me because it is set in South Station in Boston. Now I walk through it every day.Andrew decides to visit his aunt (I believe in North Carolina) on the way though, he drastically changes his appearance. Making him look very young. When he goes to visit his aunt at work, he is mistaken for a student and decides to go with it. After all who would ever look for him as a high school student. Fortunately Jon Cryer can pull this off. The plan, live with his aunt and cousin and be a high school student for a while. He decides not to tell his aunt (presumably to protect her) and crash with his cousin.Of course, best laid plans. Despite himself he shows up a few teachers and impresses some classmates who want him to run for student office. Then, he falls in love with a 16 year old classmate. Of course. And in the end the mobsters do find him and things get hairy.This movie would not have been as good without Jon Cryer. He made me believe the entire thing even that he was a 32 year old stockbroker walking around school looking like a punk rocker. I enjoyed him doing things he hadn't done in years (such as roller skating) and truly not wanting to fall for the lovely Ryan (the aforementioned 16 year old girl).Pick it up.",4,Great Movie,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,1748,"['movie', 'stockbroker', 'working', 'Boston', 'Andrew', 'Andrew', 'be', '35', 'so', 'could', 'not', 'get', 'how', 'mature', 'stock', 'brokerish', 'seemed', 'problem', 'Andrew', 'gotten', 'involved', 'mob', 'when', 'one', 'Andrew', 'friends', 'going', 'go', 'Feds', 'friend', 'killed', 'Andrew', 'put', 'protective', 'custody', 'Alas', 'protection', 'not', 'good', 'almost', 'getting', 'killed', 'himself..', 'Andrew', 'escapes', 'skin', 'teeth', 'child', 'scene', 'thrilled', 'set', 'South', 'Station', 'Boston', 'Now', 'walk', 'day.Andrew', 'visit', 'aunt', 'believe', 'North', 'Carolina', 'way', 'drastically', 'appearance', 'Making', 'look', 'very', 'young', 'When', 'visit', 'aunt', 'work', 'mistaken', 'student', 'decides', 'go', 'who', 'would', 'ever', 'look', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'Fortunately', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'plan', 'live', 'aunt', 'cousin', 'be', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'while', 'not', 'tell', 'aunt', 'presumably', 'protect', 'crash', 'cousin.Of', 'course', 'best', 'laid', 'plans', 'up', 'few', 'teachers', 'classmates', 'who', 'want', 'run', 'student', 'office', 'Then', 'love', '16', 'year', 'old', 'classmate', 'course', 'end', 'mobsters', 'do', 'find', 'things', 'get', 'hairy.This', 'movie', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'as', 'good', 'Jon', 'Cryer', 'made', 'believe', 'entire', 'thing', 'even', 'was', '32', 'year', 'old', 'stockbroker', 'walking', 'school', 'looking', 'punk', 'rocker', 'enjoyed', 'doing', 'things', 'had', ""n't"", 'done', 'years', 'such', 'roller', 'skating', 'truly', 'not', 'wanting', 'fall', 'lovely', 'Ryan', 'aforementioned', '16', 'year', 'old', 'girl', '.Pick', 'up']",N/A

Even the teachers have political viewpoints, not just parents. Maybe not anymore. After all that wouldn't be politically correct any more to talk about that in class.I feel sorry for students today, so many things are not allowed I don't know how they can learn anything about life and having a personality. Well back to this movie. It is Jon Cryer's best from all his movies that I have seen. Funny and suspenseful with some love thrown in for romantics. Cryer is a stock broker, Andrew Morenski, that finds himself on the run from hitmen. He hides out with a nephew and finds that being high school student, Max Hauser, is a good cover.

That is until the FBI wants him to testify against a mob figure regarding a bogus financial deal.  It seems okay until hit men enter the picture and the government protection lets him down.  Plan B though finds him hiding out in suburbia with his aunt and cousin and eventually leads him to hiding out back in his cousin's high school of all places.  That can't be all bad right?Wrong.  Now it's time for the best laid plans to go right out the window in the funniest ways ever.  Maxwell Hauser (nothing like getting your alias from a coffee can) becomes the oldest student ever in high school and he just can't get a break.  For someone who's trying to keep a low profile, Maxwell turns out to be an instant success.  He hits it off with his cousin's friends who want him to run for student body president. Then there are the obnoxious teachers who he happens to be smarter than and he shows them up.  And finally, he has to experience teen dating and romance all over again without falling flat on his face.  Did I mention he also has to counsel his nerdy cousin on half a dozen different things?  Oh, and this while always trying to avoid mafia assassins.  High School goes haywire, that's good fun.The acting in `Hiding Out' is really good and with Jon Cryer being the focal character, he does a great job.  Annabeth Gish was good too as his love interest and I couldn't believe I didn't see her in anything else until season nine of the X-Files.  Go figure. As far as the plot goes, it's a solid story with good doses of humor throughout and an exciting ending.  If you're a fan of 80's movies like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Sixteen Candles, and The Breakfast Club, you'll get a kick out this too.

Peterson,"[1, 6]","The 80s was a decade of waste . . . money was thrown around like it grew on trees. . . and the movie industry is one of the easiest ways to see this. This movie was a joke. It was supposed to be a movie about an adult who has to go into the witness protection program (how unique) because he is involved with the mob somehow (never really got that part . . . something about stock trading) and they are out to kill all the witnesses before the trial--him being one. So they ""age"" Jon Cryer in this creepy child molester look . . . disguise . . . like we don't know it is Jon Cryer. Anyway, how the guy looks is just creepy weird . . . the only other worse disguise trick in a movie that I have seen is ""Color of Night"" where this female actress dresses up from the get-to of her introduction to the audience as a man only for the surprise reveal at the end that she is actually a woman--NO WAY!!! Yes Way. Then how the character sets out on the run after the mob blows away his FBI protectors is just lazy writing. Anyway this gives the unimaginative writers the chance to show Cryer as a young guy, Cryer shedding his 'disguise"" so he can fit in at a high school where he hides out. To fill the voids and make movie goers think they are watching a movie and not a 30 minute sitcom they just show for no reason the main character's cousin learning to drive with all the cheesy trashcan fender benders and the nervous driver's ed instructor etc. This movie was just a reason to burn money . . . no plot, no writing, no acting. Jon Cryer looked creepy in this movie even when not in his ""disguise"" at the beginning. He has this reddish brown eyed look that made him look like a vampire. This fangs get exposed several times too. I mean I don't have anything bad to say about Cryer as I really don't know his work or anything about his image that Hollywood puts forth for him.
