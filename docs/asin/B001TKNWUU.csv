The film centers around the internal conflict of Miss Nightingale pursuing her calling as a nurse versus adhering to the traditional society pattern of marrying well and foregoing any type of career.  While we as a society often think of nurses as a kind and gentle profession, this film really reveals to what lengths Miss Nightingale and her self-funded team of nurses went through to care for the soldiers that were being neglected by the British army.  They have to travel and defy British military tradition and hierarchy.  Miss Nightingale's flawless logic and adeptness with words is highlighted in the film.  And Jacklyn Smith gives a very sophisticated and classy portrayal of Miss Nightingale, the Lady With The Lamp.

It bothers me that she is portrayed by an actress who looks as plastic as a Barbie Doll.

Baker ""book addict""","[0, 0]","Being from the medical profession and having spent many years caring for the sick, I was very interested in seeing a film about this marvelous historical woman. I read her bio and found it enthralling so I sought out this movie. I did think that her role was played well but by a gorgeous actor who according to the pictures of Miss Nightingale bears no resemblance. Not that Florence was a homely girl by any sense of the word but she was nowhere near the image of the actor who portrayed her. I think Ms. Smith did a good job with this however and did the role justice as far as she could having to fill some very impressive shoes and a white cap of Florence Nightingale.Her nurses were very good actors in their roles as were her parents and sister. The three men who fell in love with her were not in the bio so I think they were simply for effect as love interests but were not at all needed. It would have been best to stick with the real story of her accomplishments than to entangle her with men who were purely interested in sex and marriage when clearly she wasn't going in that direction. CLEARLY!One of the only moments of fright I had for her life (in the movie) was at the hands of nurse Davies who appeared to be on the verge of killing her with scissors or bleeding her to death which is what bleeding did. It was of NO good to a patient's survival but, in fact, hastened their death and as you saw or read she did not employ that dreadful British medical practice in her art of healing and thank GOD! I felt this bit of drama unnecessary as it gave the movie a sinister feel and I HATED that!All in all, it is worth the $7.00 I spent to get it.",4,Good BBC style film,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,1661,"['Being', 'medical', 'profession', 'having', 'spent', 'many', 'years', 'caring', 'sick', 'was', 'very', 'interested', 'seeing', 'film', 'marvelous', 'historical', 'woman', 'read', 'bio', 'found', 'enthralling', 'so', 'sought', 'out', 'movie', 'did', 'think', 'role', 'was', 'played', 'well', 'gorgeous', 'actor', 'who', 'according', 'pictures', 'Miss', 'Nightingale', 'resemblance', 'Not', 'Florence', 'was', 'homely', 'girl', 'sense', 'word', 'was', 'nowhere', 'image', 'actor', 'who', 'portrayed', 'think', 'Ms.', 'Smith', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'however', 'did', 'role', 'justice', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'having', 'fill', 'very', 'impressive', 'shoes', 'white', 'cap', 'Florence', 'Nightingale.Her', 'nurses', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'roles', 'were', 'parents', 'sister', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'fell', 'love', 'were', 'not', 'bio', 'so', 'think', 'were', 'simply', 'effect', 'love', 'interests', 'were', 'not', 'needed', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'stick', 'real', 'story', 'accomplishments', 'entangle', 'men', 'who', 'were', 'purely', 'interested', 'sex', 'marriage', 'when', 'clearly', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'direction', 'CLEARLY', 'One', 'only', 'moments', 'fright', 'had', 'life', 'movie', 'was', 'hands', 'nurse', 'Davies', 'who', 'appeared', 'be', 'verge', 'killing', 'scissors', 'bleeding', 'death', 'what', 'bleeding', 'did', 'was', 'NO', 'good', 'patient', 'survival', 'fact', 'hastened', 'death', 'saw', 'read', 'did', 'not', 'employ', 'dreadful', 'British', 'medical', 'practice', 'art', 'healing', 'thank', 'GOD', 'felt', 'bit', 'drama', 'unnecessary', 'gave', 'movie', 'sinister', 'feel', 'HATED', '7.00', 'spent', 'get']",Florence Nightingale

The movie did allude to the crucial importance of the London Times in financing Ms. Nightengale, and their embedded correspondent in waking up the populace.

1236724,A2BIAR1V0PWO27,B001TKNWUU,"Roger Kennedy ""International Military Music S...","[6, 6]","This is a decent and nicely produced period piece.  The portrayal of Nightengale seems correct and perhap a little stiff, but this goes along with the feeling of the time.  The costumes and uniforms are all quite correct for the Crimean War period.  We even get a few Highlanders and Guards in bearskins!Naturally a film like this is going to portray the Victorian British army as a crude male dominated organization.  The problem was that ineffiency was emblematic to all armies of this period.  The US was hardly in any better shape when our Civil War broke out a few years later and thousands were lost from bad care.  The French had a marginally better medical organization in the Crimea and by use of the Vivandiers, the lady Canteen carries, they had a least a built in element to use for helping the soldiers. The Russians were even worse off with hardly any medical care and their losses from this war will probably never be known.The British army suffered from an antiquated organization that had changed little  since the Napoleanic Wars.  The Duke of Wellington would have been quite at home with the army in 1854, as it was still his army in spirit.  The ineffiency however was something he would have corrected.  Unfortunately Lord Raglin did not have this ability, despite his long association with the Iron Duke.Miss Nightengale certainly was a catalyst to address change.  Without her this would have happened anyway, as reforms throughout the army were due as a result of that first dreadful winter in the Crimea.  She certainly played her part to accomplish this noble end.  One notes that at Scutari Hospital the mortality rate was roughly 44% before she and the reforms instituted by Parliamentry Commissions were implimented.  Six months later it was reduced down to 2%.  Miss Nightengale and her staff, along with many dedicated army doctors deserve much credit for this.  The Crimean War was a first for many things.  Nursing was just one of them.I enjoyed this film and thought it was well done.  There are not many dramas out there on the Crimean War, and for this reason alone I gave it a good rating.  I withheld 5 stars because its too bad the DVD package did not include a few extras such as a Bio on Miss Nightengale as well as some background for the general viewer on the war itself.  After all this is what DVDs are for.

Anyway, it was a good price and I thought I also might learn a bit about Florence Nightengale.  I did learn a lot 1about her, a woman in the !850's, in England who brought about important changes in nursing. Health conditions in hospitals were disgusting at the time and nurses were looked upon in a very negative light.  It showed how Florence was unconventional, decided to go against he typical women's role of marriage and motherhood of the times and dedicated her life to nursing and trying to change society's attitude towards women's roles, nursing and health practices. Timothy Dalton played the part of her suitor Richard Milnes, who wanted to marry her but still supported her in her efforts.
