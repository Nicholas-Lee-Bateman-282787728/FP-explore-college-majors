I look forward to viewing the remaining episodes. I can relate to the main character. Its really good to see a policeman who actually cares about people and doing a good job, because it looks like he's the only one at his precinct that does. His colleagues are jerks, but they make Davies look good. Highly recommend this series.The only negative is no closed captions--Unfortunately, too many British series don't have them.

971983,AXSH6O4OP5L4M,B000EDWLTG,"Atheen M. Wilson ""Atheen""","[9, 10]","I purchased these because I enjoyed Peter Davidson's work on the Albert Campion MysteriesCampion - Look to the Ladywhere he plays a sophisticated, wealthy aristocrat ""slumming"" as a detective assisted by his valet, Lug, a former burgler.  I've read all of Margary Allingham's novels and really enjoyed the Acorn series that put them into a visual form, but after that set came to a conclusion I was at a loss.  Looking for another character with similar charm, I found the ""Dangerous Davis"" series with Peter Davidson again featured as the central character.  Although Dangerous is anything but dangerous, and the character lacks the sophistication and poise of Albert Campion, he definitely has a personality that appeals just as much.  His capacity to find his way to a brilliant conclusion that gives no one any happiness, even himself, is sad but endearing.  His sympathy with the ""villians"" of the piece is understandable since many of them are the down and out and never win types.  His rapport with them is entertaining.  My favorite scene is one in season 2The Last Detective - Series 2when he must stop a man with a bomb from leaping from the window to escape arrest.  It turns out the dinamite is actually a package of hotdogs!  Wonderful.  His response to the villian's question, ""How did you know?"" was classic:  ""I'm a policeman.  We know everything!""  Cute.

971988,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,B000EDWLTG,C. O. DeRiemer,"[15, 17]","Detective Constable Davies (Peter Davison) is a mild-mannered man, easy going, always willing to help others, unwilling to hurt others, easy to take advantage of. He is separated from his wife, Julie (Emma Amos), who is divorcing him. Please note that elements of the plot are discussed. Julie still likes him at times but is utterly tired of his niceness and imperturbability. His boss, Detective Inspector Aspinall (Rob Speedlove), has no use for him, especially since Davies began looking into the disappearance of a 17-year-old girl which took place more than 20 years ago. Davies didn't do a very good job of letting his boss know what was going on, then Davies discovered that the murder was something of an accident and that the murderer was a fellow cop still on the force. ""What about me,"" the man pleads. ""I didn't mean to do it. It was 20 years ago."" ""What about the girl's family?"" Davies asks. ""They've waited 20 years to find out what happened to their daughter."" Davies forces the man to confess. For his troubles, Aspinall tells Davies he'll be the last detective on the force to ever get a major case. Davies' fellow coppers treat him with a mixture of condescension and amused contempt. They've given him the nickname ""Dangerous"" because he's the least dangerous copper they've ever met. He has one friend, Mod (Sean Hughes), who does odd, strange jobs for a living, has time to help out Davies and who brings a kind of off-the-wall humor to Davies' problems. ""I think I'm being stalked,"" Davies tells Mod one afternoon. ""I knew a woman who wouldn't leave me alone,"" Mod says. ""She'd follow me everywhere, buy me clothes and give me money."" ""Did you go to the police?"" Davies asks. ""No,"" Mod says, ""it'd be a cruel man who'd turn in his own mother.""Despite never being assigned a major case to solve, circumstances usually come Davies' way that grow into complex mysteries. A missing person, an elderly man who was a dance partner for many older women at a dance club, seems not to be missed much at all by his aging wife. A report of a break-in grows slowly into the deranged fantasies of an unstable and dangerous woman. The accidental death of a homeless man leads to secrets which had been kept hidden for years.There are two problems, in my view, with this series. First, Davies is so unremittingly nice, so easily walked over by his fellow detectives, so readily dismissed by his boss, so easily used by his wife, that at some point in each story I want to shake him by his labels and tell him to stand-up for himself. The niceness is an appealing story device, but Dangerous Davies becomes a real person only in the last 20 minutes or so of each mystery. This is when he is putting the pieces together, discovering what the mystery was about and, still with niceness, is going to get the bad guy and see that justice is done. The second problem is that, with the exception of Mod, there are no likable or even very interesting regular characters for Davies to react with. All this means is that the stories rise and fall on how skilled an actor Davison is and on how intriguing the mysteries are.Davison does a first-rate job. His Dangerous Davies is rumpled, out of shape and balding a little. He's a guy you'd like as a neighbor, always willing to pitch in and help. Davison does such a good job with the role that it's easy to believe Davison may be like this in real life. If you've seen him in Campion, All Things Great and Small or as a villain in Mrs. Bradley Mysteries you'll know what a versatile actor he is. The mysteries, however and in my opinion, vary in quality. Some are simply more interesting than others. Well-known actors, such as Sian Phillips, David Troughton and Julia McKenzie, show up now and then. Unfortunately, the series also sometimes provides ""acting moments"" for them...dramatic monologues where they confess weaknesses, face the truth and come very close to chewing the scenery.The Last Detective is a well-mounted and undemanding mystery series. If you're prepared not to be too demanding yourself, you'll probably enjoy it. On the whole, I did.

971994,A29VKODW4R5U7W,B000EDWLTG,dooby,"[51, 52]","I enjoyed this series very much. On the surface it's just another detective show. But it has a wry British twist to it. Based on Leslie Thomas' 4 novels about ""Dangerous Davies"", a good-natured, comically unfortunate detective, this new Granada/ITV production is a welcome respite from the hardnosed, grimy detective shows which we have become accustomed to of late. DC (Detective Constable) Davies is a very ordinary fellow, middle-aged, unlucky in life and unlucky in love. But he has a ready smile, a friendly word for everyone and most importantly, a kind heart. With Peter Davison at the helm, this makes for a very amiable series, much like its lead character and the actor portraying him. It is as much Davies' interaction with the people around him, his ex-wife, friends, colleagues and witnesses, as the mysteries that he stumbles upon, that make this series so enjoyable. Mostly it appeals to the British sense of cheering on the underdog.Peter Davison, who for many will forever be the rascally Tristan Farnon from the beloved BBC production of ""All Creatures Great and Small,"" has aged very gracefully and made a new name for himself as the downtrodden, though always lovable, DC Davies. One British newspaper reviewer even referred to him as ""the cuddly detective"".It is already into its fourth season in the UK. Unlike American series, each season consists of just 4 episodes. Each episode is about 70-75 minutes long. The pilot episode runs for 95 minutes. Of the four episodes in this first season, three are based on the original novels. Only Episode 3, ""Tricia,"" is new material. The plot of the fourth and last novel is only televised at the end of Season 2. The fourth novel sees Davies retiring from the force and setting up his own detective agency. In the TV series however, Davies never retires but goes plodding along in his dead-end job as a superannuated detective constable.The series was shot in high defintion widescreen.

I saw the great reviews and knew it had to be good.  The actor who plays Dangerous, the detective, is very believable and endearing.  As one of the characters said of him: ""you have a kind face"".  But he's been on a losing streak, marriage dissolved, career going nowhere, boss from hell along with colleagues of similar ilk.  Things are going south until he starts investigating on the sly a cold case.Suddenly, it's obvious that he has a lot more going for him than his ex-wife, coworkers and he himself realized, but still not a happy ending.  In fact his boss indicates he might be the ""last detective"" he'd call on--when you watch the show, you'll see why.Not a promising start for a flourishing career for the detective, but we can guess he still is going to get some interesting cases for this series to flourish.  He will just have to out maneuver his boss.  It will add to the suspense to see how he does this.If you liked the Jackson Brodie series, which I adored, this one has a bit of the same quirky music and ""down and out"" and lovable detective going for it.Am looking forward to getting back on the treadmill to watch the second show in the series.

When I found this set though I bought it at once and do not regret in in the least.Like Inspector Barnaby in the  Midsomer Mysteries, the detective played by Davison in this series is incredibly decent, while there is also a good amount of both pathos and humor in his interaction with the public, his ex-wife and his fellows in the police.  His wife observes that she loves a man in uniform and their marriage was over when he made CID.  His boss states that if he had his way Davies would be back in uniform and visiting schools to offer safety tips.  Davies refuses to ask for a transfer out of the CID office of Willesden, probably because he knows it would be refused.  Between a rock and a hard place seems to be home to Davies, but he is still a very good detective, sometimes to his own dismay when things work out very black indeed.Now for the thing that fascinates me about this series and other British series I have watched in the past-- Davison doesn't make any effort to cover up the fact that he is going bald.  In fact it's rather endearing.  Having had male colleagues who have gone to outrageous lengths to look a little less bald-- spray on scalp paint, anyone? A combover?  A weave?  Hair transplant????
