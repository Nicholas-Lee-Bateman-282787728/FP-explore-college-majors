They must if FOX keeps churning them out. They're not complete idiots; if something's working (ie: making money), they keep at it.Now we have this Homer/Marge relationship DVD with four more episodes to put on the shelf. One's great, one's good, the other two are average. Ho-hum. Average disc, hoo-rah.My real problem with these DVDs is not like these other raving fans in that FOX is releasing these instead of the season sets. Relax, guys, we've got two seasons coming out a year. That's pretty damn good if you ask me. What I don't like is the tacked-on ""theme"" and selection of mediocore episodes. The Christmas 2 set had two episodes that had NOTHING to do with Christmas! Stop that nonsense. If you want to release these quick-buys, start a new line ""Simpsons Classics."" Search the myriad of fan sites and find the top 20 or so critically acclaimed episodes and release those on DVD. At least that looks like you put some thought into it.In closing, you lunatic fans can just stop bombarding amazon with one-star reviews just because you're mad that FOX apparently is like some kind of bully on the schoolyard dangling future season DVDs over your heads. They're not that evil. They're not going to come out any faster with you complaining, so just review the DVD on its episodes. In this case, it's pretty average.

You're not supposed to be complaining about how FOX is trying to  screw people out of their money.I have been a Simpson fan from the very first episode. And as a true Simpson fan I'm going to buy this DVD. Yes, we all love the Season box sets, but they are expensive. Some people just don't have that type of money and in all honesty I've bought all my DVDs on eBay for a lot cheaper.Back to this DVD - personally I love the 4 episode DVDs. I really don't have the time or patience to sit and go through each DVD season and find a specific episode. That's why I completly love and enjoy these DVDs. All the episodes on the DVD have a common theme to it and their episodes taken from every season. You're  getting the classics and the newbies all on one DVD.If you have a problem with the 4 episode DVDs, complain to FOX.

953894,A1NDYL6D6QNVCI,B000BZISQW,"Valnastar ""Man With No Name""","[24, 26]","Here is a brief synopsis of each episode on this 4-episode release:Natural Born Kissers (season 9)Homer and Marge have trouble capturing their old magic in the bedroom and learn to get it back by adding a sense of danger to their love life. They begin ""snuggling"" in very public places in order to add excitement to their romance, but this quickly goes awry when they are caught on the miniature golf course.Large Marge (season 14)Lisa wins a bet with Homer on the Dewey/Truman presidential election of 1948 and gets to pick the day's father/daughter activity. Lisa chooses to assist with building houses for the homeless. Homer removes his wedding ring after getting paint on it and the usual confusion and mayhem ensues when Marge believes he is flirting with other women.Three Gays of the Condo (season 14)Homer and Marge argue when Homer finds out Marge married him because she was pregnant with Bart. He decides move in with Milhouse's dad. When that doesn't work out, he's eventually taken in by Karl, his former assistant. Karl has a flamboyant alternate lifestyle and Homer gets involved in it with the expected comedic results.The Way We Weren't (season 15)When Homer mentions that Marge was not his first kiss, the story flashes back to Homer in summer camp where his first kiss was with an anonymous girl who turns out to be Marge after all. In the flashback, Homer fails to show up for a planned meeting with her because he accidentally winds up in a fat camp, but all the years since that incident Marge believed she was stood up.This collection of 4 episodes from seasons 9, 14, and 15 on the theme of romance should please any Simpsons fan who enjoys these single-disc releases. Although all these episodes will eventually be available on full season sets, if you can't wait for some of the later seasons to arrive or if you prefer less expensive ""best of"" collections then this disc is for you. Although the lack of extra features or more episodes on the disc is a negative, the price of the disc is relatively modest and most of the episodes are fairly good ones.",4,"Four good episodes from seasons 9, 14 and 15",1138752000,"02 1, 2006",2006,2080,"['Here', 'brief', 'synopsis', 'episode', '4-episode', 'release', 'Natural', 'Born', 'Kissers', 'season', '9', 'Homer', 'Marge', 'have', 'trouble', 'capturing', 'old', 'magic', 'bedroom', 'learn', 'get', 'back', 'adding', 'sense', 'danger', 'love', 'life', 'begin', 'snuggling', 'very', 'public', 'places', 'order', 'add', 'excitement', 'romance', 'quickly', 'awry', 'when', 'are', 'caught', 'miniature', 'golf', 'course.Large', 'Marge', 'season', '14', 'Lisa', 'bet', 'Homer', 'Dewey/Truman', 'presidential', 'election', '1948', 'pick', 'day', 'father/daughter', 'activity', 'Lisa', 'assist', 'building', 'houses', 'homeless', 'Homer', 'wedding', 'ring', 'getting', 'paint', 'usual', 'confusion', 'mayhem', 'ensues', 'when', 'Marge', 'flirting', 'other', 'women.Three', 'Gays', 'Condo', 'season', '14', 'Homer', 'Marge', 'argue', 'when', 'Homer', 'out', 'Marge', 'married', 'was', 'pregnant', 'Bart', 'move', 'Milhouse', 'dad', 'When', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'eventually', 'taken', 'Karl', 'former', 'assistant', 'Karl', 'flamboyant', 'alternate', 'lifestyle', 'Homer', 'involved', 'expected', 'comedic', 'results.The', 'Way', 'Were', ""n't"", 'season', '15', 'When', 'Homer', 'mentions', 'Marge', 'was', 'not', 'first', 'kiss', 'story', 'back', 'Homer', 'summer', 'camp', 'where', 'first', 'kiss', 'was', 'anonymous', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'Marge', 'flashback', 'Homer', 'show', 'up', 'planned', 'meeting', 'accidentally', 'up', 'fat', 'camp', 'years', 'incident', 'Marge', 'believed', 'was', 'stood', 'up.This', 'collection', '4', 'episodes', 'seasons', '9', '14', '15', 'theme', 'romance', 'should', 'please', 'Simpsons', 'fan', 'who', 'single-disc', 'releases', 'episodes', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'available', 'full', 'season', 'sets', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'later', 'seasons', 'arrive', 'prefer', 'less', 'expensive', 'best', 'collections', 'then', 'disc', 'lack', 'extra', 'features', 'more', 'episodes', 'disc', 'negative', 'price', 'disc', 'relatively', 'modest', 'most', 'episodes', 'are', 'fairly', 'good', 'ones']",The Simpsons - Kiss and Tell: The Story of Their Love
