1272152,A3BOGELRQJK8OE,B002JTMNZU,a gentle sound,"[2, 3]","I'm feeling melancholy. It was a pleasant buzz to find this quiet movie.It is intimate, close. Two people trying on a coat in a small closet close.I lost myself awhile and came out feeling differently. Just moved along.I guess it's the story of a one night stand. Seemed to me it was the telling of attraction, discovery, intimacy, an art piece about the feelings of night and day and being in San Francisco.Awfully close to something you shared and put away. Which she does and I don't think he can.It asks some things, there are fragments of these quintessential themes between these two in their coupling, their race, their desire. Those glimmer and relate this to moments you've shared in your New York secrets, your heart roaming looking for the key to cure this existential pain. Right? She's, of the two,  the more elusive, the less knowable-I took it as a male perspective but, whatever...she's cheating on a white boyfriend. It's a thread....the evening happens, a day happens, an experience. A bicycle.If you like a movie where nothing happens, you'll enjoy this one.Or, as my son said, what's this *&(&?Wyatt Cenac was great....real. I love real in art.I thought it was lovely.(favorite part- the cinematography, a shot of a scene meaning he got a condom-done as it is it is like that moment-and when he tells his story of designing fish tanks, the camera is a story teller here, uniquely beautiful work-the loss of color as the world draws into their intimacy, the appearance of color as the world re-intrudes and they separate...all brilliant art symbols)",4,Buzz,1298678400,"02 26, 2011",2011,1568,"[""'m"", 'feeling', 'melancholy', 'was', 'pleasant', 'buzz', 'find', 'quiet', 'movie.It', 'intimate', 'close', 'Two', 'people', 'trying', 'coat', 'small', 'closet', 'close.I', 'lost', 'awhile', 'came', 'out', 'feeling', 'differently', 'Just', 'moved', 'along.I', 'guess', 'story', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Seemed', 'was', 'telling', 'attraction', 'discovery', 'intimacy', 'art', 'piece', 'feelings', 'night', 'day', 'being', 'San', 'Francisco.Awfully', 'close', 'something', 'shared', 'put', 'away', 'Which', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can.It', 'things', 'are', 'fragments', 'quintessential', 'themes', 'two', 'coupling', 'race', 'desire', 'glimmer', 'relate', 'moments', ""'ve"", 'shared', 'New', 'York', 'secrets', 'heart', 'roaming', 'looking', 'key', 'cure', 'existential', 'pain', 'Right', 'two', 'more', 'elusive', 'less', 'knowable-I', 'took', 'male', 'perspective', 'cheating', 'white', 'boyfriend', 'thread', '.the', 'evening', 'happens', 'day', 'experience', 'bicycle.If', 'movie', 'where', 'nothing', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'one.Or', 'son', 'said', 'what', '*', 'Wyatt', 'Cenac', 'was', 'great', '.real', 'love', 'real', 'art.I', 'thought', 'was', 'lovely', 'favorite', 'part-', 'cinematography', 'shot', 'scene', 'meaning', 'got', 'condom-done', 'moment-and', 'when', 'story', 'designing', 'fish', 'tanks', 'camera', 'story', 'teller', 'here', 'uniquely', 'beautiful', 'work-the', 'loss', 'color', 'world', 'intimacy', 'appearance', 'color', 'world', 're-intrudes', 'separate', 'brilliant', 'art', 'symbols']",N/A

It wasn't playing in any theaters near me, but I was lucky enough to catch a screening of it at the Smithsonian while I was in D.C. This was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time, period.Of course, being a young black woman the film resonated with my personal experiences. After a one night stand, Micah wants to get to know Jo because he doesn't have any black friends. Although Jo is a buppie and Micah is working class, they are both intelligent and share many hobbies and interests. There isn't much dialogue, but the soundtrack and the characters' body language and exchanged glances speak volumes. The cinematography is beautiful and intensely personal, keeping the viewer engaged throughout.This film deftly addresses the issues of loneliness, class, and definitions of ""black"" and ""white"" without being too preachy, save for a scene where they drop in on a neighborhood forum protesting gentrification.  Medicine's ending is fittingly inconclusive, as it explores the question: what, exactly, brings people together?",5,"""Medicine"" is the cure for mediocrity too",1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,1072,"['first', 'heard', 'film', 'online', 'was', ""n't"", 'playing', 'theaters', 'was', 'lucky', 'enough', 'catch', 'screening', 'Smithsonian', 'was', 'D.C', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'period.Of', 'course', 'being', 'young', 'black', 'woman', 'film', 'resonated', 'personal', 'experiences', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'Micah', 'get', 'know', 'Jo', ""n't"", 'have', 'black', 'friends', 'Jo', 'buppie', 'Micah', 'working', 'class', 'are', 'intelligent', 'share', 'many', 'hobbies', 'interests', ""n't"", 'much', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'characters', 'body', 'language', 'exchanged', 'glances', 'speak', 'volumes', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'intensely', 'personal', 'keeping', 'viewer', 'engaged', 'throughout.This', 'film', 'deftly', 'issues', 'loneliness', 'class', 'definitions', 'black', 'white', 'being', 'too', 'preachy', 'save', 'scene', 'where', 'drop', 'neighborhood', 'forum', 'protesting', 'gentrification', 'Medicine', 'ending', 'fittingly', 'inconclusive', 'question', 'what', 'exactly', 'people', 'together']",N/A
1272154,AX1QTOOXPVD8L,B002JTMNZU,"Balaji Rajam ""Wannabe Reviewer""","[11, 13]","It is tough to digest that this is Barry Jenkins' first movie. The confidence and the subtelty of his craft seems to reflect years of film making.A great instance of this is the opening sequence. Two strangers wakiing up from a one-night stand and trying to find their bearings. The awkward glances, the stilted conversation are all something which most of us have known first hand.In the above scene and pretty much forthe rest of the movie, Jenkins makes us a vouyeur yearning to know what transpires after that night. It is very reminiscent of Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.As the non-night stand reluctantly meanders on to a day long romance, the characters and the city (my beloved San Francisco) comes to life.. Just like the early morning fog clearing out, the characters shake of their uneasieness and come into their own.Wyatt Cenac - (of The Daily Show) shows us his flexibility beyond comedy.Tracey Heggins is a revelation. The incredibly beautiful Heggins portrays the vulnerability and the defiance of a young African American woman in such an effortless manner. Hopefully Hollywood takes note. We could definitely do with more such actresses.When I recommend Before Sunrise and Before Sunset to friends, I ask them not to watch it passively. Same applies to this movie. The nuances are the really tasty bits.",4,A one night stand gone good,1257724800,"11 9, 2009",2009,1325,"['tough', 'digest', 'Barry', 'Jenkins', 'first', 'movie', 'confidence', 'subtelty', 'craft', 'reflect', 'years', 'film', 'making.A', 'great', 'instance', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Two', 'strangers', 'wakiing', 'up', 'one-night', 'stand', 'trying', 'find', 'bearings', 'awkward', 'glances', 'stilted', 'conversation', 'are', 'something', 'most', 'have', 'known', 'first', 'hand.In', 'above', 'scene', 'pretty', 'much', 'forthe', 'rest', 'movie', 'Jenkins', 'vouyeur', 'yearning', 'know', 'what', 'night', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Sunrise', 'Sunset.As', 'non-night', 'stand', 'reluctantly', 'meanders', 'day', 'long', 'romance', 'characters', 'city', 'beloved', 'San', 'Francisco', 'life..', 'Just', 'early', 'morning', 'fog', 'clearing', 'out', 'characters', 'shake', 'uneasieness', 'come', 'own.Wyatt', 'Cenac', 'Daily', 'Show', 'flexibility', 'comedy.Tracey', 'Heggins', 'revelation', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'Heggins', 'vulnerability', 'defiance', 'young', 'African', 'American', 'woman', 'such', 'effortless', 'manner', 'Hopefully', 'Hollywood', 'note', 'could', 'definitely', 'do', 'more', 'such', 'actresses.When', 'recommend', 'Sunrise', 'Before', 'Sunset', 'friends', 'ask', 'not', 'watch', 'passively', 'Same', 'applies', 'movie', 'nuances', 'are', 'really', 'tasty', 'bits']",N/A

1272157,A28OS9JADNW18M,B002JTMNZU,"Rashid Darden ""Novelist""","[3, 3]","My arts fraternity, Gamma Xi Phi, recently got together to watch this DVD.  We like to highlight independent works where possible and none of us had yet seen Medicine for Melancholy.To recap the plot:  A black guy and black girl randomly hook up at a party and spend the next 24 hours together enjoying and re-discovering San Francisco.The twist is how Barry Jenkins gets us there.  In my opinion, the viewer instantly falls in love with Micah.  He seems to be a complex, artsy, romantic... and he's awkward.  The female lead, however, is less sympathetic in the beginning.  (Her name is withheld because it's a spoiler, sorta.)  So after the first ten minutes, my group really HATES the female lead.  But we're eager to see how the director makes her sympathetic.He does.  He nails it with the story, she nails it as an actress.  It's really just a beautiful, brief love story.There are few things I could critique in this film.  First, some of you may not like the washed out, nearly black-and-whiteness of the film.  Only certain segments are filmed in vivid, rich colors.  But I think that serves a purpose artistically.There are a few scenes where the characters do things which may not occur between two strangers in the ""real world"" but because of the actors, you believe it.  Well, I do.There are also a few preachy scenes as well.  Gentrification is a main point of this story and I think because me (and the audience I was with) thoroughly understand what gentrification and urban renewal mean to people of color and the poor, the narrative wasn't very necessary.  BUT, I do think it was necessary for the female lead to hear said narrative.  So again, all is forgiven.I've said the word ""awkward"" once.  If you are a fan of the Awkward Black Girl web series, I think you will like this film.  No, it's not a comedy.  But it's the type of film that shows the diversity of black folks in the real world.  It's not Love & Basketball, Jason's Lyric, or The Best Man.  This is a life-sized (not larger than life) film about the kind of folks you might have gone to school with.My review doesn't do the film justice.  It's just plain GOOD.",5,I dare you to give it less than five stars.,1327449600,"01 25, 2012",2012,2144,"['arts', 'fraternity', 'Gamma', 'Xi', 'Phi', 'recently', 'got', 'together', 'watch', 'DVD', 'like', 'highlight', 'independent', 'works', 'where', 'possible', 'none', 'had', 'yet', 'seen', 'Medicine', 'Melancholy.To', 'recap', 'plot', 'black', 'guy', 'black', 'girl', 'randomly', 'hook', 'up', 'party', 'spend', 'next', '24', 'hours', 'together', 'enjoying', 're-discovering', 'San', 'Francisco.The', 'twist', 'how', 'Barry', 'Jenkins', 'there', 'opinion', 'viewer', 'instantly', 'love', 'Micah', 'be', 'complex', 'artsy', 'romantic', 'awkward', 'female', 'lead', 'however', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'beginning', 'name', 'withheld', 'spoiler', 'sorta', 'So', 'first', 'ten', 'minutes', 'group', 'really', 'female', 'lead', ""'re"", 'eager', 'see', 'how', 'director', 'sympathetic.He', 'story', 'actress', 'really', 'just', 'beautiful', 'brief', 'love', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'could', 'critique', 'film', 'First', 'may', 'not', 'like', 'washed', 'out', 'nearly', 'black-and-whiteness', 'film', 'Only', 'certain', 'segments', 'are', 'filmed', 'vivid', 'rich', 'colors', 'think', 'purpose', 'are', 'few', 'scenes', 'where', 'characters', 'do', 'things', 'may', 'not', 'occur', 'two', 'strangers', 'real', 'world', 'actors', 'believe', 'Well', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'preachy', 'scenes', 'as', 'well', 'Gentrification', 'main', 'point', 'story', 'think', 'audience', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'understand', 'what', 'gentrification', 'urban', 'renewal', 'mean', 'people', 'color', 'poor', 'narrative', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'necessary', 'BUT', 'do', 'think', 'was', 'necessary', 'female', 'lead', 'hear', 'said', 'narrative', 'So', 'again', 'forgiven.I', ""'ve"", 'said', 'word', 'awkward', 'once', 'are', 'fan', 'Awkward', 'Black', 'Girl', 'web', 'series', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'film', 'No', 'not', 'comedy', 'type', 'film', 'diversity', 'black', 'folks', 'real', 'world', 'not', 'Love', 'Basketball', 'Jason', 'Lyric', 'Best', 'Man', 'life-sized', 'not', 'larger', 'life', 'film', 'kind', 'folks', 'might', 'have', 'gone', 'school', 'with.My', 'review', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'just', 'plain', 'GOOD']",N/A

Melancholy follows the adventures of Micah(Wyatt Cenac of the Daily Show) and Jo(Tracey Heggins) after they awake from a drunken one night stand.The morning after is awkward for both but Micah does his best to be upbeat and charming. Despite his best efforts, it's pretty obvious that Jo isn't having it. Jo accommodates him by agreeing to go to coffee and spiting a cab but burns him soon after by giving him a false name and leaving Micah to fork up the fee. A cunning attempt at a clean get away fails when Micah discovers that she left her purse. He tracks her down to return it and a budding romance begins, but not without some catches. ""Medicine for Melancholy"" is slow paced. So slow paced that it can become hypnotic but it's a quality that adds to its charm. Most of the compliments for the film have been for its cinematography but I felt that the gray filter that was used took away from some of the scenes of downtown San Fran. Overall, ""Medicine for Melancholy"" a pleasing film about being young and trying to connect with the opposite sex in a beautiful city, great performances and a well written script make this a film worth viewing.",4,I want my heart sown back together.,1258675200,"11 20, 2009",2009,1286,"['heard', 'Medicine', 'Melancholy', 'magazine', 'was', 'featured', 'top', 'five', 'indie', 'films', 'fall', 'so', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'Melancholy', 'adventures', 'Micah', 'Wyatt', 'Cenac', 'Daily', 'Show', 'Jo', 'Tracey', 'Heggins', 'awake', 'drunken', 'one', 'night', 'stand.The', 'morning', 'awkward', 'Micah', 'best', 'be', 'upbeat', 'charming', 'best', 'efforts', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'Jo', ""n't"", 'having', 'Jo', 'agreeing', 'go', 'coffee', 'spiting', 'cab', 'soon', 'giving', 'false', 'name', 'leaving', 'Micah', 'fork', 'up', 'fee', 'cunning', 'attempt', 'clean', 'get', 'away', 'when', 'Micah', 'left', 'purse', 'down', 'return', 'budding', 'romance', 'not', 'catches', 'Medicine', 'Melancholy', 'slow', 'paced', 'So', 'slow', 'paced', 'can', 'become', 'hypnotic', 'quality', 'charm', 'Most', 'compliments', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'cinematography', 'felt', 'gray', 'filter', 'was', 'used', 'took', 'away', 'scenes', 'downtown', 'San', 'Fran', 'Overall', 'Medicine', 'Melancholy', 'pleasing', 'film', 'being', 'young', 'trying', 'connect', 'opposite', 'sex', 'beautiful', 'city', 'great', 'performances', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'make', 'film', 'viewing']",N/A
