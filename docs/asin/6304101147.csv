401105,A1LBAC84TLIGAX,6304101147,"ACEMAN1 ""HERE TO PISS YOU OFF""","[3, 4]","I might be going out on a limb, but I will say that I actually really enjoyed this sequel to the original Don Bluth classic. Now don't get me wrong, it is inferior to the original, but it's not bad like some people make it out to be. This is a very surprising review for me; not only am I giving a positive review to a kid's film, but I'm also writing a positive review for a sequel to a kid's film. I, like many of you have seen a large number of horrid sequels to these classic animated films (Atlantis - Milo's Returnis still the worst sequel I've ever seen). However, this film is being unfairly criticized, and some people have had the audacity to ask the question; ""Which is worse, this orThe Secret of NIMH 2 - Timmy to the Rescue?"" Now, I have seen Secret of Nimh 2, and it was a ghastly-bad film (But I intend to buy it and watch it again for a future review), and many decried it as an insult to the original classic, which it was. Don Bluth had nothing to do with sequel, but the team behind it created a perfectly serviceable and fun film, that is certainly worth a look.WHAT IT'S ABOUT: We start off in Heaven with a ceremony for most-improved angels, which of course Charlie Barkin doesn't get. Shortly after the ceremony, his old friend Itchy dies and makes his way into heaven. Before I go on, I was baffled with the timeline of this film. The first was set in 1939, while this one is set in the 90's, and Charlie died in the first one but Itchy didn't. If he died in 1939, then how did Itchy not die until the 90's? Were they reincarnated at some point that we failed to notice? Anyway, despite the gaping plot hole, let's move on. So after the awards ceremony, Carface (The dog mobster villain from the first film who somehow ended up in heaven) steals Gabriel's horn and drops down to Earth in San Francisco, where he drops it in mid-air and loses it. So Charlie and Itchy are sent down to San Francisco to retrieve the horn and Charlie sees it as a chance to have fun again, but they can't because they're ghosts, so Charlie can't drink and he can't talk to Sasha (The female dog he falls in love with) at the bar they're at. So they accidentally meet up with Carface at a bar and he takes them to Red (Who is the main villain in the film) where he fixes them with mysterious red collars which allows them to be in a physical form. So Charlie and Itchy go back to the bar where Sasha is, and their introduction isn't exactly the greatest, but they still decide to follow her home, where they meet David, a runaway boy/magician. Together, the group must find Gabriel's horn in time, otherwise Red will steal it and use it for evil purposes, and the group is taken on one crazy adventure.MUSIC: This film had pretty good music, and musical scenes in the film were generally good and rather catchy (Most sequels to animated films turn into torturous musicals, but this was clearly the exception). Not all the musical scenes were great, but I thought they were more well-written musicals than the first film's.ACTION: While this film is more action-packed than its predecessor, it pales in comparison to the first one because the storyline certainly isn't on par with the first one and doesn't make you feel for the characters emotionally like the first film. However, this film manages to overcome most of its shortcomings through a fun sense of humor and crazy action. The best thing about this film was that I was never bored (Though I was certainly never bored of the first film at all) and was constantly entertained throughout. If you're adult whose not too stuck up, you'll have fun with this as well as the kids will. This area excels despite story and emotional shortcomings.ACTING: I really liked these actors. They weren't quite on par with the actors in the first film (Minus Dom DeLuise who reprises his role as Itchy in this film and he's still just as good). However, I would have to say I liked Charlie Sheen better as Charlie (But Burt Reynolds was still good in the first film). But Sheena Easton as Sasha was somewhat iffy and I wasn't entirely fond of her performance, nor Ernest Borgnine's performance as Carface (The original actor for him in the first film was so much better). But, the rest of the actors are pretty good, especially considering this is a sequel. For the most part, this area is very good, but it does need a few areas to be fixed.OVERALL: If you loved the first film, and you don't set your standards too high, then you'll like All Dogs Go To Heaven 2. It was solid and very good, and should have no problem entertaining kids or adults. However, this sequel is more tame than its predecessor, and the story wasn't as remarkable as the first film's mafia/revenge/redemption/friendship storyline. This film's only moral teaching is of friendship, and while it still works, it wasn't as effective as the redemption/friendship morals of the first film. I was satisfied with this sequel, and I'm willing to defend it because it is not a bad sequel.THE GOOD: Good acting, good music, plenty of crazy action moments, and solid moral teachings of friendship.THE BAD: The storyline has plot holes, two actors aren't very good, and the story isn't as remarkable.",4,A RESPECTABLE SEQUEL  8 OUT OF 10,1254614400,"10 4, 2009",2009,5209,"['might',

Basically its about 2 dogs Charlie Barkin and his friend Itchy return to earth to retrive Gabriels Horn and it calls all the dogs to heaven. The movie itself was just corny and so were the songs. Charlie complains about being bored in Heaven. How can you be bored in Heaven? I would think Heaven is much more fun than being in Hell. Carface was stupid he should have never trusted Red I think he should have known something was off about him. And the villian Red (which we all know is the devil) is too scary for little kids to watch. And the fact that from what I read of bad reviews of this film it wasn't like the first film which I'm sure the first film is much better than this piece of garbage.

How could it?  (Spoilers for the first movie ahead.)  Charlie B. Barkin died in the first movie. He went  to Heaven. Itchy stayed with Anne-Marie. That's how the movie ended, how it  was meant to end. Charlie was not meant to suddenly decide he felt bored in  Heaven (how could anyone be _bored_ in Heaven?) and come back to Earth. He  already _had_ a second chance to come back to Earth and redeem himself. In  the first movie. That's that. And Charlie in the sequel was not the Charlie  we all know and love from the first movie. First of all, Charlie Sheen did  a find job and all, but I'm sorry; Burt Reynolds _is_ Charlie B. Barkin.  That's all there is to it. But it's more than that. Charlie did not really  act like he did in the first movie. Completely different character. But I  think the biggest problem I have with this sequel is that it is _such_ a  cheap movie in comparison to the original. The original was about love and  redemption and honor and loyalty and friendship. About letting some  cynicism of the world go and letting hope come back into your life. That  effect was lost in the sequel. The sequel was a cartoon; the original was  an animated classic _movie_. This was one of my Dad's favorite movies, and  when he passed away nearly a year ago, the original was heart-warming to  watch. It helped me to believe in hope (&quot;You know, good-byes aren't  forever.&quot;).

The characters are memorable and the film has nice voice acting. This movie is much more upbeat than the first one. It also has a beautiful song in it called ''I Will Always Be With You''.The film is about Charlie Barkin who is in heaven with Carface, and Annabelle (the Whippet Angel from the first) is giving a speech about how all dogs deserve a second chance. She mentions if any dog wins a medal, they can go come back to life and live on Earth again. At the beginning, Itchy goes to heaven and meets Charlie, we find out Itchy died because he choked on a chicken bone. Charlie then shows Itchy around heaven and Charlie explains that he is bored and he would love to go back to Earth. Later, Carface steals Gabriel's horn, which is the horn that opens heaven's gate, and he goes back down to Earth. Upon arrival, he loses the horn. Annabelle is then shocked, and asks Charlie and Itchy to go back to Earth to retrieve the horn, or else a disaster will happen. Before they leave, she gives them a ''Miracle'', a magic spell from heaven that can be used for anything.When Charlie and Itchy get back to Earth, they go to a bar, but then they realize nobody can see them because they are angels. Then a beautiful female dog named Sasha starts performing on stage, and Charlie starts swooning. Charlie and Itchy then meet Carface and a dog he's working for, who gives them a magic collar that can make them visible.We find out the dog is really an evil cat from the other side. The cat is trying to steal Gabriel's horn in order to open the gate to heaven and kidnap all the angels.Charlie then follows Sasha home and then finds out she is taking care of a boy named David who ran away from home. The rest of the film is about Charlie, Itchy, Sasha, and David finding the horn and saving the angels from the evil cat.This is a fun adventure movie that I totally recommend.",5,One of my all time favorite animated films,1369094400,"05 21, 2013",2013,1966,"['love', 'Dogs', 'Go', 'Heaven', '2', 'fun', 'adventure', 'movie', 'bright', 'colorful', 'characters', 'are', 'memorable', 'film', 'nice', 'voice', 'acting', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'upbeat', 'first', 'one', 'also', 'beautiful', 'song', 'called', 'Will', 'Always', 'Be', '.The', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Barkin', 'who', 'heaven', 'Carface', 'Annabelle', 'Whippet', 'Angel', 'first', 'giving', 'speech', 'how', 'dogs', 'deserve', 'second', 'chance', 'dog', 'medal', 'can', 'go', 'come', 'back', 'life', 'live', 'Earth', 'again', 'beginning', 'Itchy', 'heaven', 'meets', 'Charlie', 'find', 'out', 'Itchy', 'died', 'choked', 'chicken', 'bone', 'Charlie', 'then', 'Itchy', 'heaven', 'Charlie', 'bored', 'would', 'love', 'go', 'back', 'Earth', 'Later', 'Carface', 'Gabriel', 'horn', 'horn', 'heaven', 'gate', 'back', 'down', 'Earth', 'arrival', 'horn', 'Annabelle', 'then', 'shocked', 'Charlie', 'Itchy', 'go', 'back', 'Earth', 'retrieve', 'horn', 'else', 'disaster', 'will', 'happen', 'leave', 'Miracle', 'magic', 'spell', 'heaven', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'anything.When', 'Charlie', 'Itchy', 'get', 'back', 'Earth', 'go', 'bar', 'then', 'realize', 'nobody', 'can', 'see', 'are', 'angels', 'Then', 'beautiful', 'female', 'dog', 'named', 'Sasha', 'performing', 'stage', 'Charlie', 'swooning', 'Charlie', 'Itchy', 'then', 'meet', 'Carface', 'dog', 'working', 'who', 'magic', 'collar', 'can', 'make', 'visible.We', 'find', 'out', 'dog', 'really', 'evil', 'cat', 'other', 'side', 'cat', 'trying', 'steal', 'Gabriel', 'horn', 'order', 'open', 'gate', 'heaven', 'kidnap', 'angels.Charlie', 'then', 'Sasha', 'home', 'then', 'out', 'taking', 'care', 'boy', 'named', 'David', 'who', 'ran', 'away', 'home', 'rest', 'film', 'Charlie', 'Itchy', 'Sasha', 'David', 'finding', 'horn', 'saving', 'angels', 'evil', 'cat.This', 'fun', 'adventure', 'movie', 'totally', 'recommend']",All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 VHS

This one had less profantity than the original but still not clean enough in my opion to be g rated. This should be fine if you 8 or older. Charlie returns  but played by a different actor. Carface is in heaven.  Where he should not have gone after the way he treated Charlie in the original film. Other than Charlie, Itch Anabella and Careface none of the charters from the previous movie are in it.  Charlie must  go to earth to recover Gabriels horn after its droped by Carface while he attemps to steal it. This was the second to last entry in the series.  I am plaining on writing a grown up version of the original movie with more violence, language and more action.  The ending the first movie should have had.  Charlie ends will be the same but carface's will change. He will return to Ann Morry in the sequels when he goes to retrive Gabriel's horn.  The King gator will return Asmodous, Scragg  from Redwall and Golloum from the Hobbit Lord of the Rings and return of king (Original animated versions)  Will help charlie as they plan there escape from hell and the down fall of Sauron and Melificent and the plan the  destruction of hell.",4,A excellent sequel,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,1237,"['Realsed', '1996', 'was', 'sequel', 'original', 'also', 'was', 'T.V', 'show', 'one', 'had', 'less', 'profantity', 'original', 'still', 'not', 'clean', 'enough', 'opion', 'be', 'g', 'rated', 'should', 'be', 'fine', '8', 'older', 'Charlie', 'played', 'different', 'actor', 'Carface', 'heaven', 'Where', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'gone', 'way', 'treated', 'Charlie', 'original', 'film', 'Other', 'Charlie', 'Itch', 'Anabella', 'Careface', 'none', 'charters', 'previous', 'movie', 'are', 'Charlie', 'must', 'go', 'earth', 'recover', 'Gabriels', 'horn', 'droped', 'Carface', 'steal', 'was', 'second', 'last', 'entry', 'series', 'am', 'plaining', 'writing', 'grown', 'up', 'version', 'original', 'movie', 'more', 'violence', 'language', 'more', 'action', 'ending', 'first', 'movie', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'Charlie', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'carface', 'will', 'change', 'will', 'return', 'Ann', 'Morry', 'sequels', 'when', 'retrive', 'Gabriel', 'horn', 'King', 'gator', 'will', 'return', 'Asmodous', 'Scragg', 'Redwall', 'Golloum', 'Hobbit', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'return', 'king', 'Original', 'animated', 'versions', 'Will', 'help', 'charlie', 'plan', 'escape', 'hell', 'down', 'fall', 'Sauron', 'Melificent', 'plan', 'destruction', 'hell']",All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 VHS

Charlie is not the same lovable rascal he was in the first movie. He's lost a sensee of real street-smarts that were so visible in the first one. You don't really conect with the characters in the movie, because you dont see them develop. Charlie doesn't change any, nor do Sasha or Itchy. David changes a little, but not enough to tug the heartstrings of the viewers. Its not a very emotional movie (Okay...1 song is), unlike the original. I just can't really get to like this movie.
