I started watching this a few years back but never got into too it as much because I was young i think. Now that I'm 21 I understand so much better. I love Shawn and Gus so much. Shawn is much more funnier but all the charterers work good. I think my favorite episode is Poker I barely know her because it was like a comedy and not a drama. Scary Sherry Bianca's Toast freaked me out a little but it was still good. No matter how bad a episode is it would be because of the guest stars never Shawn or Gus. He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, He Loves Me, Oops He's Dead, 9 Lives, Forget me Not, From the Earth to the Starbucks and the Pilot are also favorites of mine. I only wish the season could be longer like other shows but it still gives over 11 hours of comedy and drama. Very good show.

There is some physical comedy, what with Shawn failing about with his pretend visions, which is normally a turn-off for me.  But the chemistry between the actors is almost flawless.  Gus's deadpan reactions to the antics and Lassiter's reluctance to even be in the same room with the duo both make for great viewing.  It still cracks me up almost every time Shawn calls him Lassie even though it shouldn't.  Somehow, it just never crosses the line into silly.There are pop culture references sprinkled throughout (mostly from the 80s) that might even spark some nostalgia.

The West Wing is one of my favourite series of all time. When I heard that Dule Hill was starring in Psych, I assumed it was a deadly serious psychological drama. I mean, that is the kind of thing brilliantly talented actors like Dule Hill act in, right?Wrong.Whereas other crime dramas are going the serious and dark route, Psych does a complete and total 180-degree turn and goes for the laughs instead. The series takes its time building up both its characters and the situation, but once it gets going it is addictively funny viewing.James Roday is a charismatic lead actor. There's a little Jim Carrey-ishness in his Psychic slapstick, but he has his own innate charm that allows him to pull off some outrageous stuff. And Dule Hill, as always, does great work as the straight-man - never an easy role to play when your co-star is stealing the limelight. Fortunately, Dule deftly holds his own.I was delightfully surprised, in these grimly serious times, to see that series as lighthearted and entertaining as this are still being produced.

We were hooked in the first few minutes! Rarely do you find a show with as new and fresh a premise as this one does. The crazy, laugh yourself silly humor that permeates each episode is incredible and thankfully doesn't sink to using poo jokes, sexual innuendos, etc, to get a laugh.James Roday is Genius as Shawn Spencer the lead character, who spends his time teasing his best friend Gus (Dule Hill) and solving crimes anonymously, using his extreme attention to detail, taught to him by his cop father,  who is expertly played by Corbin Bernsen of LA Law fame. When the police one day suspect that he's been committing the un-lawful acts, he gets out of it by claiming to be psychic. When it actually works, no one is more surprised then Shawn himself! Now he has to keep the act going and use his ""powers"" to solve other cases assigned to him. This proves difficult at times, due to the skepticism of the head detective, Lasseter (Timothy Omundson) At the end of the pilot, Shawn and Gus decide to start their own detective agency, called Psych, and thus begins the series that is one in a million. The first season is packed with awesome extras and the second season (just released!) is even better. The commentaries are hilarious to listen to and the gag reel is sure to make you chuckle. We absolutely LOVE this show! It's a pleasure to watch again and again! (Which I do, at least every couple of months!)

This show is one of the most witty, well written, superbly acted and uniquely crafted on television.  The great James Roday is suberb as Shawn in every single episode.  Using his photographic memory to pretend he is a psychic provides him with material for a tour de force performance every episode.  And his side kick Gus played by Dule Hill is his perfect partner.  This show works on so many levels for each character is superbly realized and all come to life with an all around excellent cast.  When a show is really good you can fall into it from the very first episode.  And that is what happens with PSYCH.  The premise is established in the pilot and each episode is a wonder.  This is also the type of show that is a must own if you are a fan for each episode can be watched over and over just for the acting and the laughs.  And the laughs are never ending, often resulting in belly laughs.  This is such a feel good show.Of course after viewing the first season I had to purchase seasons 2-4.

There is a lot of adlibbing and improv in the filming of the show which allows for some hilarious one-liners. Psych can be absurd and juvenile, but it is entertaining and generally wholesome enough that I could recommend it to my pretty conservative parents who find most of the humor on TV today to be offensive.

Sadly, as a Monk viewer, I cannot say that the past couple of seasons of that show have been of a consistent high quality - some have been downright painful to watch, for which I blame different writers and directing.  Hopefully PYSCH will be able to maintain its quality of writing, acting, and directing.  The cast of PSYCH is superb - beyond the two leads, we have an excellent supporting cast, plus Corbin Bernson just lends something to the show that just seems to take it up a notch on the grin-factor scale.  The writing is SO good - rarely do I watch even good episodes of MONK twice, but with PSYCH, I actually enjoy watching episodes through multiple times, and will share scenes with friends (eg. the cat in the car with Gus).  The show doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, but what it is, is a sharp, witty, snappily-paced crime mystery show.

Saw the ads for this, and after hearing the premise, I got curious. When the premiere rolled around, I was hooked.Man, I love Shawn and Gus!  Without doing a total rehash of the plot: Shawn grew up with his cop father, Henry (Corbin Bernsen who is great in this) who taught him how to be observant of everything in a room. So while on a date, Shawn notices something on the tv and calls in a tip to the police. When he goes to the station to collect his reward, they threaten to arrest him b/c he knows too much about what happened. So to get himself out of trouble, he has a ""psychic episode."" And thus starts the hilarious journey.The comedic timing of James and Dule' is fabulous.  You can tell that they are enjoying themselves. This also goes for the rest of the cast.  The humor is never overdone, and it's never vulgar which makes it great for family viewing. They're solving crimes, but it's never the same, stale story every episode.  The creators have also done a great job of casting little Shawn and Gus. Those boys are adorable!The supporting cast compliments the leads very well. I've already mentioned Shawn's dad, Henry, but the two detectives, Lassiter (aka ""Lassie) and Juliet (""Jules"") are a treat to watch as well.I love all of the pop culture references, and the poking fun at themselves.

And everyone around him reacts with outrageous comic precision.I particularly like this show's reliance on ""outsider humor,"" when someone who doesn't belong intrudes on a closed circle.  The Marx Brothers made a career of this humor, which is pretty much the opposite of the hip cynicism that dominates current comedy.  Instead of winking to the audience that we're all in on this joke at another's expense, the patently ridiculous interloper casually overturns everyone else's expectations.The producers could do well with thinking a few things through.  The police chief's pregnancy is a recurring gag in the first half of the season, but after the birth, her baby merits nary a mention.  Supporting characters' traits appear as the plot demands (Gus's spelling and his comic book fixation, to name just two) and go away when the writers don't need them anymore.  A little consistency might smooth these concerns.These issues notwithstanding, I enjoy this show.  It has a strong positive energy, a sprightly attitude, and a brand of humor that we see too little these days.  This show knows it's dumb, and it has fun with that fact, just kicking its heels up and playing.  That kind of energy is infectious, which explains why so many people can't get enough.",4,Can't Get Enough,1280966400,"08 5, 2010",2010,1604,"['current', 'fad', 'mystery', 'sitcoms', 'one', 'out', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'secretly', 'profound', 'pregnant', 'social', 'import', 'just', 'goofy', 'Shawn', 'Spencer', 'fake', 'psychic', 'just', 'cracks', 'wise', 'caroms', 'walls', 'force', 'hyperactive', 'grade', 'schooler', 'image', 'reinforced', 'constant', 'flashbacks', 'everyone', 'outrageous', 'comic', 'precision.I', 'particularly', 'show', 'reliance', 'outsider', 'humor', 'when', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'belong', 'intrudes', 'closed', 'circle', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'made', 'career', 'humor', 'pretty', 'much', 'opposite', 'hip', 'cynicism', 'current', 'comedy', 'Instead', 'winking', 'audience', ""'re"", 'joke', 'expense', 'patently', 'ridiculous', 'interloper', 'casually', 'everyone', 'else', 'expectations.The', 'producers', 'could', 'do', 'well', 'thinking', 'few', 'things', 'police', 'chief', 'pregnancy', 'recurring', 'gag', 'first', 'half', 'season', 'birth', 'baby', 'merits', 'nary', 'mention', 'Supporting', 'characters', 'traits', 'appear', 'plot', 'demands', 'Gus', 'spelling', 'comic', 'book', 'fixation', 'name', 'just', 'two', 'go', 'away', 'when', 'writers', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'anymore', 'little', 'consistency', 'might', 'smooth', 'concerns.These', 'issues', 'notwithstanding', 'enjoy', 'show', 'strong', 'positive', 'energy', 'sprightly', 'attitude', 'brand', 'humor', 'see', 'too', 'little', 'days', 'show', 'dumb', 'fun', 'fact', 'just', 'kicking', 'heels', 'playing', 'kind', 'energy', 'infectious', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough']",N/A

The one thing he absolutely knows he doesn't want to do is become a cop.  That's what his dad (Corbin Bernsen) has been training him to do since he was a little kid.  Growing up, he learned how to observe every little detail at a glance.Even though Shawn has no desire to be a cop, he can't stop himself from calling in tips to the local police based on news reports he sees.  After one such tip, he finds himself under suspicion for knowing too much.  He quickly talks his way out of it by pretending to be a psychic.  In fact, he's so convincing, Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) hires him on a part time basis to help with difficult cases.Shawn is usually teamed up with Detectives Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) and O'Hara (Maggie Lawson).  Lassiter doesn't believe a word Shawn says and usually tries to trip him up.  O'Hara is skeptical but can't deny what she sees Shawn pull off time after time.Also along for the ride is Shawn's best friend Gus (Dule Hill).  Gus is reluctant to get involved in the cases, but Shawn drags him in anyway.  And the two have to deal with plenty of exciting cases.  There's a heir who is kidnapped, murders at a spelling bee and a comic convention, dastardly deeds at a high society wedding, and an urban legend that may be repeating itself.This show is a blend of comedy and mystery.  It airs right after Monk on USA, and is a perfect fit.  While that show is often melancholy, this one is high energy.  In fact, sometimes, it's a bit too over the top.  But most of the time it's fun.As with many shows, it took a little while to hit its stride.  The first few mysteries are rather weak and the focus is on Shawn doing his fake psychic thing.  When the show returned from hiatus with ""Forget Me Not,"" (easily my favorite of the season) it found the right balance.  The show is still hilarious but the mysteries are much tighter.And the comedy has something for everyone.  It's got fast, witty dialog, absurd situations, and full body slapstick.The DVD set is packed with lots of extras.  There are plenty of deleted scenes and one or two commentaries per disc.  The first disc contains two versions of the pilot, behind the scenes segments, and some hilarious bloopers.  My only real complaint with the set is the lack of episode descriptions.  The titles are given, but they don't always trigger my memory as to what the episode itself is about.The show took a while to find its footing.

1067835,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B000P0I4P8,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[16, 27]","There's a real chance that writing this will get me flamed by fans of the show, but it seems like a dissenting opinion is needed here, and I feel like the one to give it.PSYCH, a program about a hyper-observant guy who solves crimes under the guise of a psychic detective, is a bad show.  It really is.  Let me count the ways.CHARACTERS: The show is basically a live-action cartoon, with the lead character -- Shawn -- doing his best impersonation of Bugs Bunny.  Just like Bugs he takes virtually nothing serious, is unaccountably smug and vain, manipulates and takes advantage of everyone (including family and close friends), and never misses an opportunity to crack wise or engage in some melodramatic slap-stick.  He's supposed to be charming, but the guy is a complete and total jerk.  Shawn (begrudgingly) shares the screen with a hapless sidekick name Gus (a pharmaceutical rep who delivers every line the exact same way), a triumverate of easily duped detectives (one of whom is a lackadaisical police chief who lets Shawn get away with all sorts of tomfoolery, including fraud, evidence tampering, and breaking and entering), and his grumpy father (an ex-cop played with skill by Corbin Bernsen).COMEDY: There are basically four types of jokes in the show.  1) Shawn gads about during one of his ""psychic episodes,"" flinging things around and being a nuisance.  2) Shawn makes a pop culture reference.  3) Shawn insults Gus, Lassiter (one of the detectives), his father or some random character who's wandered into his radar.  4) Shawn aggressively hits on an attractive woman.  Some of the wordplay is witty, but most of the comedic burden lies on Shawn mugging it up.MYSTERY: None.  There ARE mysteries, of course, but they are just as cartoonish as the rest of the show, meaning that the end of each episode is more than a little reminiscent of Scooby-Doo.  Here's a fun game: count how many times the bad guys (or girls) give themselves away at the climax by revealing a detail they shouldn't know.BACKGROUND: A gimmick of the show is that each episode starts with a moment from Shawn's childhood, which is then tied to whatever mystery he stumbles across that week.  This is actually decently done, as is Shawn's history with his father and (mostly absent) mother.EVERYTHING ELSE: The love interest is forced and tiresome.  There's no element of credibility to anything that happens (which means there is also not one iota of tension or suspense to any of the episodes).  Even the theme song is bad enough to set my teeth on edge.Sounds bad, yeah?  But here's the thing: I CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT.Yes!  It's a bad show.  A bad, pointless, unfulfilling, highly addictive show.  It's like eating an entire family-sized bag ofCheetosin one sitting.  You just consumed a ton of empty calories, most of it puffy, crunchy air, and you know that what you just did was in no way healthy or beneficial for you.  So why did you do it?  The cheese.  That neon dusting of cheese was enough to make the puff taste so good, you couldn't help but cram it down.This show is a family-sized bag of Cheetos.  There is absolutely no reason to recommend this show or to watch it yourself.  There are meals of far greater quality, with far better ingredients, put together in a far more pleasing manner.  But, heck, sometimes you just what something cheesy that crunches.  So, those of you who love this show, I understand where you're coming from, although I think you should stop trying to describe the writing, characters, plots, or dialogue as anything short of wincingly bad.  This is, without question, a bad, bad, just really bad show.More please.",3,Cheetos For The Soul,1264032000,"01 21, 2010",2010,3646,"['real', 'chance', 'writing', 'will', 'get', 'flamed', 'fans', 'show', 'dissenting', 'opinion', 'needed', 'here', 'feel', 'one', 'give', 'it.PSYCH', 'program', 'hyper-observant', 'guy', 'who', 'crimes', 'guise', 'psychic', 'detective', 'bad', 'show', 'really', 'Let', 'count', 'ways.CHARACTERS', 'show', 'basically', 'live-action', 'cartoon', 'lead', 'character', 'Shawn', 'doing', 'best', 'impersonation', 'Bugs', 'Bunny', 'Just', 'Bugs', 'virtually', 'nothing', 'serious', 'unaccountably', 'smug', 'vain', 'manipulates', 'advantage', 'everyone', 'including', 'family', 'close', 'friends', 'never', 'opportunity', 'crack', 'wise', 'engage', 'melodramatic', 'slap-stick', 'supposed', 'be', 'charming', 'guy', 'complete', 'total', 'jerk', 'Shawn', 'begrudgingly', 'shares', 'screen', 'hapless', 'sidekick', 'name', 'Gus', 'pharmaceutical', 'rep', 'who', 'line', 'exact', 'same', 'way', 'triumverate', 'easily', 'duped', 'detectives', 'one', 'whom', 'lackadaisical', 'police', 'chief', 'who', 'Shawn', 'get', 'away', 'sorts', 'tomfoolery', 'including', 'fraud', 'evidence', 'tampering', 'breaking', 'entering', 'grumpy', 'father', 'ex-cop', 'played', 'skill', 'Corbin', 'Bernsen', '.COMEDY', 'are', 'basically', 'four', 'types', 'jokes', 'show', '1', 'Shawn', 'one', 'psychic', 'episodes', 'flinging', 'things', 'around', 'being', 'nuisance', '2', 'Shawn', 'pop', 'culture', 'reference', '3', 'Shawn', 'insults', 'Gus', 'Lassiter', 'one', 'detectives', 'father', 'random', 'character', 'who', 'wandered', 'radar', '4', 'Shawn', 'aggressively', 'attractive', 'woman', 'wordplay', 'witty', 'most', 'comedic', 'burden', 'Shawn', 'mugging', 'up.MYSTERY', 'None', 'ARE', 'mysteries', 'course', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'cartoonish', 'rest', 'show', 'meaning', 'end', 'episode', 'more', 'little', 'reminiscent', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Here', 'fun', 'game', 'count', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'bad', 'guys', 'girls', 'give', 'away', 'climax', 'revealing', 'detail', 'should', ""n't"", 'know.BACKGROUND', 'gimmick', 'show', 'episode', 'moment', 'Shawn', 'childhood', 'then', 'tied', 'whatever', 'mystery', 'week', 'actually', 'decently', 'done', 'Shawn', 'history', 'father', 'mostly', 'absent', 'mother.EVERYTHING', 'ELSE', 'love', 'interest', 'forced', 'tiresome', 'element', 'credibility', 'anything', 'also', 'not', 'one', 'iota', 'tension', 'suspense', 'episodes', 'Even', 'theme', 'song', 'bad', 'enough', 'set', 'teeth', 'edge.Sounds', 'bad', 'yeah', 'here', 'thing', 'CA', ""N'T"", 'STOP', 'WATCHING', 'IT.Yes', 'bad', 'show', 'bad', 'pointless', 'unfulfilling', 'highly', 'addictive', 'show', 'eating', 'entire', 'family-sized', 'bag', 'one', 'sitting', 'just', 'consumed', 'ton', 'empty', 'calories', 'most', 'crunchy', 'air', 'know', 'what', 'just', 'did', 'was', 'way', 'healthy', 'beneficial', 'why', 'did', 'do', 'cheese', 'neon', 'dusting', 'cheese', 'was', 'enough', 'make', 'puff', 'taste', 'so', 'good', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'cram', 'down.This', 'show', 'family-sized', 'bag', 'Cheetos', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'recommend', 'show', 'watch', 'are', 'meals', 'far', 'greater', 'quality', 'far', 'better', 'ingredients', 'put', 'together', 'far', 'more', 'pleasing', 'manner', 'heck', 'sometimes', 'just', 'what', 'something', 'cheesy', 'crunches', 'So', 'who', 'love', 'show', 'understand', 'where', ""'re"", 'coming', 'think', 'should', 'stop', 'trying', 'describe', 'writing', 'characters', 'plots', 'dialogue', 'anything', 'short', 'wincingly', 'bad', 'question', 'bad', 'bad', 'just', 'really', 'bad', 'show.More', 'please']",N/A

Notice I didn't say, rent it, but buy it. Psych is a very funny and unique show.For those of you who have no idea what the show is about, it's about a guy who has fantastic observational skills and claims to be a psychic. Shawn (the fake psychic) and his partner, Gus, solve crimes for the police.  Trust me, when I say this isn't your typical show. It's so gosh darn funny.  The comedic timing between Shawn and Gus with each other, and Shawn and Gus with the rest of the cast is amazing. The jokes come so fast, you'll miss some of them. I watch them over and over, and see jokes that I miss the first time I saw it.  It is that good, I can also promise you won't get tried of it.There's a fantastic running gag. Each eppy has a pineapple somewhere in it. See if you can find it.  Sometimes it's really easy to see, and sometimes it's tricky to spot, but a pineapple is always there.Another strong point in the series is that the start of the eppy, shows Shawn and Gus as kids, and it somehow relates to the eppy, it's fantastic.The casting is top notch  for everyone.  All of the characters play well off each other, and each have their own traits.  This show is wonderfully written. The jokes are so funny, and you have to be quick, or you miss them.  Shawn and Gus are silly and goofy, but that just adds charm to the show.Shawn and Gus also make reference to 80's movies, it's a hoot. That all goes back to strong writing.If you like a perfect show, with great casting, snappy dialogue, great comedic timing and playing off each other, then this show is for you.I can't really tell you what one eppy is better than another, b/c all of them are good. Every single one. I can't say enough good things about Psych.If you start the Psych ride, you won't be sorry. I know I'm not.

I had seen it when it originally aired but never again until now. I forgot how well the series started. It seemed like from the pilot they had this show figured out. They knew exactly what to do and no time was spent trying to find it's footing. It left the gates in full stride.The actors from the start are hilarious and you will laugh a lot during this first season. I think that in many ways this is the best season of Psych. That is not meant as a complaint of future seasons but as a compliment to this one.  The other seasons are stellar but this one soars above them in charm and overall writing. The cases are more traditional this time around. They follow the more normal murders and do not stray into the weird and ridiculous like later seasons. It acts more like a procedural drama in that respect. That doesn't mean the comedy is subdued, far from it. Some of these episodes are downright gut busters as you have to control yourself in order to hear all the dialogue after an awesome joke.Another thing that I like in this opening season is the better use of the flashbacks. In later seasons the connections to the flashbacks are forced. Not so in the first season as they seem to compliment instead of feed off of each other.As for the dvd itself there are deleted scenes along with some audio commentaries. Nothing too special but they certainly add some sparkle to this set. There are fifteen episodes which is a great number compared to other traditional thirteen episode premiere season runs. This is a series that should be picked up by fans of procedural dramas. It is not a cut and dry procedural like most thanks to the comedy and great performances throughout by all of the cast.

This series has been on for sometime and the ratings shown are weighted quite high. I bought the first two seasons and while they contained a good doses of ""Mind Candy"" they left me wanting for something solid to bite into. Each of the segments/weekly shows had a distinct cookie cutter similarity and in a low budget way. Back in 2005 I started developed a sincere dislike for 18 minutes per hour for the 42 minutes of content. I developed a taste for several of the TV programs but chose to wait till each TV sitcom or movie came out on video and invest more of my time on physical activities. Because of his I only purchase time proven movies like; Rich Man Poor man, Chiefs, and TV shows like; the Closer, The Gifted man, Veronica Mars, et al and watch them when ""I wanted to, without the weekly cliff hangers"". That being said, in Psych the banter between Roday and Dule became more and more predictable and the negative prattle seemed to loose its flavor. Because of this  I have stopped watching TV and my knowledge of really good TV shows  has diminished.  I have switched to movies, but admittedly chose to purchase additional seasons of Psych and a select few to search for humor in the action packed movies I consume nightly and have learned to enjoy.
