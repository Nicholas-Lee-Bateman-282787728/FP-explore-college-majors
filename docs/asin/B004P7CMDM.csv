The City of Angels only redeeming feature is it had decent actors in it.  Wicked Prayer was just flat horrible.

1423349,ADMRUFWI3JVQB,B004P7CMDM,Willatron,"[2, 5]","This is a good $5 deal for two mediocre movies!The Crow: City Of AngelsWhat I liked about the movie:1. The coloring of the movie made it very dark and brooding!2. The criminals in this movie really deserved to be punished!3. The basic plot was good!4. The soundtrack was (for the most part) good but not great!5. Most of the actors tried to do a good job with their parts!6. The end of the movie had a nice twist to it!7. The part after the crow kills the character Spider monkey (they playWhite Zombie's I'm Your Boogieman) he walks out of the fire! That was my favoriteparty of the entire movie!What I didn't like:1. The pace was too slow!2. The plot didn't hold the movie up enough!3. Vincent Perez was not the best choice for the crow!4. Mia was not the best choice for a young adult Sarah!5. They went a little over-board with the drugs!6. Why is the cocaine black?7. They were showing the same flashback sequences too many times!8. There was too much whispering!Bottom line: They pretty much too the first crow movie's basic ideas and ruined most of them!My grade: C or two stars!The Crow: Wicked PrayerBad, bad, bad movie!What I liked:1. The cast was great!2. The lighting was good!What I didn't like:1. The dialog made no sence!2. The plot made no sence!Bottom line: I did not understand anything in this movie! It was bad! I know it was a B-movie, but still The Crow: Salvation was a B-movie but you could still understand what was going on in the movie! Even The Crow: City Of Angels had heart too it! So avoid this piece of crap, hopefully the next one will be better!One can hope...!Overall: The Crow: City Of Angels was weird but still watchable! But avoid The Crow: Wicked Prayer!Overall grade for the package: C- or a-star-and-a-half!",2,The Crow 2: Okay...! The Crow 4: Bad!!!,1323388800,"12 9, 2011",2011,1749,"['good', '5', 'deal', 'two', 'mediocre', 'movies', 'Crow', 'City', 'AngelsWhat', 'liked', 'movie:1', 'coloring', 'movie', 'made', 'very', 'dark', 'brooding', '2', 'criminals', 'movie', 'really', 'deserved', 'be', 'punished', '3', 'basic', 'plot', 'was', 'good', '4', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'most', 'part', 'good', 'not', 'great', '5', 'Most', 'actors', 'tried', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'parts', '6', 'end', 'movie', 'had', 'nice', 'twist', '7', 'part', 'crow', 'character', 'Spider', 'monkey', 'playWhite', 'Zombie', ""'m"", 'Your', 'Boogieman', 'fire', 'was', 'favoriteparty', 'entire', 'movie', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like:1', 'pace', 'was', 'too', 'slow', '2', 'plot', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'movie', 'up', 'enough', '3', 'Vincent', 'Perez', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'crow', '4', 'Mia', 'was', 'not', 'best', 'choice', 'young', 'adult', 'Sarah', '5', 'went', 'little', 'over-board', 'drugs', '6', 'Why', 'cocaine', 'black', '7', 'were', 'showing', 'same', 'flashback', 'sequences', 'too', 'many', 'times', '8', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'whispering', 'Bottom', 'line', 'pretty', 'much', 'too', 'first', 'crow', 'movie', 'basic', 'ideas', 'ruined', 'most', 'grade', 'C', 'two', 'stars', 'Crow', 'Wicked', 'PrayerBad', 'bad', 'bad', 'movie', 'What', 'liked:1', 'cast', 'was', 'great', '2', 'lighting', 'was', 'good', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'like:1', 'dialog', 'made', 'sence', '2', 'plot', 'made', 'sence', 'Bottom', 'line', 'did', 'not', 'understand', 'anything', 'movie', 'was', 'bad', 'know', 'was', 'B-movie', 'still', 'Crow', 'Salvation', 'was', 'B-movie', 'could', 'still', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'Even', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'had', 'heart', 'too', 'So', 'avoid', 'piece', 'crap', 'hopefully', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'One', 'can', 'hope', 'Overall', 'Crow', 'City', 'Angels', 'was', 'weird', 'still', 'watchable', 'avoid', 'Crow', 'Wicked', 'Prayer', 'Overall', 'grade', 'package', 'C-', 'a-star-and-a-half']",N/A
