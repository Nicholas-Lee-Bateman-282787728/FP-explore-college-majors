1008382,A2V96BLJYN5CR9,B000GYI3MW,"A. Crane ""Joy to read""","[1, 3]","I'd love to give this series a better review as I like the premise a lot and Alan Davies' character is fun, but the part of his crime solving partner Maddy is absolutely painful. The writers pull out every cliche of an overweight nearing middle-age woman. She is desperate, pushy and a slob. They never miss a chance to show her shoving food (ideally multiple candy bars) into her face or making jokes about her heft and lack of fitness. She makes endless cow eyes at and propositions Jonathan, who shows no interest in her, making her both pathetic and contemptible. She is jealous, devious, and lies without compunction, particularly to other women who find Jonathan attractive. She whines, flies into ridiculous rages, and is dumb as a rock. Luckily, Jonathan is there to explain everything to her while his distaste for her seeps through his every word. She regularly begs him to 'support' her both emotionally and financially (seemingly through marriage). Oh, and she's a terrible driver.I've made this sound like a terrible show and it really isn't if you can ignore the entire Maddy and Jonathan storyline or it simply doesn't bother you. While the situations are almost all of the 'locked room' variety, they are clever and I like the idea of an inventor of magic tricks solving complex murders. It probably hasn't helped that I've watched the show in 2-3 episode blocks which highlight the misogyny underlying the Maddy character. Many people find her character funny, I just can't.",3,The cliche partner harms the show,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,1491,"[""'d"", 'love', 'give', 'series', 'better', 'review', 'like', 'premise', 'lot', 'Alan', 'Davies', 'character', 'fun', 'part', 'crime', 'solving', 'partner', 'Maddy', 'absolutely', 'painful', 'writers', 'pull', 'out', 'cliche', 'overweight', 'nearing', 'middle-age', 'woman', 'desperate', 'pushy', 'slob', 'never', 'miss', 'chance', 'show', 'shoving', 'food', 'ideally', 'multiple', 'candy', 'bars', 'face', 'making', 'jokes', 'heft', 'lack', 'fitness', 'endless', 'cow', 'eyes', 'propositions', 'Jonathan', 'who', 'interest', 'making', 'pathetic', 'contemptible', 'jealous', 'devious', 'compunction', 'particularly', 'other', 'women', 'who', 'find', 'Jonathan', 'attractive', 'flies', 'ridiculous', 'rages', 'dumb', 'rock', 'Luckily', 'Jonathan', 'there', 'explain', 'everything', 'distaste', 'seeps', 'word', 'regularly', 'begs', ""'support"", 'emotionally', 'financially', 'seemingly', 'marriage', 'Oh', 'terrible', 'driver.I', ""'ve"", 'made', 'sound', 'terrible', 'show', 'really', ""n't"", 'can', 'ignore', 'entire', 'Maddy', 'Jonathan', 'storyline', 'simply', ""n't"", 'bother', 'situations', 'are', 'almost', ""'locked"", 'room', 'variety', 'are', 'clever', 'like', 'idea', 'inventor', 'magic', 'tricks', 'solving', 'complex', 'murders', 'probably', ""n't"", 'helped', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'show', '2-3', 'episode', 'blocks', 'highlight', 'misogyny', 'underlying', 'Maddy', 'character', 'Many', 'people', 'find', 'character', 'funny', 'just', 'ca', ""n't""]",Jonathan Creek - Season One

So who better than a man who invents illusions for a living to unravel the mysteries? ""Jonathan Creek - Season One"" tackles that idea with bizarre British aplomb, and comes up with five spectacularly weird murder mysteries where nothing is as it seems.A famous artist is found murdered in his bedroom, with his bound and gagged mistress lying nearby. It's thought to be a robbery gone wrong. Journalist Maddie Magellan (Caroline Quentin) is convinced that his fashion mogul wife is the culprit... except she has an airtight alibi.So she ends up turning to a rather odd acquaintance: Jonathan Creek (Alan Davies), a professional creator of magic tricks with a knack for lateral thinking. And while Jonathan comes up with a way the wife could have done the deed, there are a lot of clues that hint that the murder was a lot more complex than that.After that, a famous slapstick comedian is found shot in the head in a nuclear bunker, but he wasn't physically capable of shooting himself. A plastic surgeon is found dead, and his famous ex-lover seems to be the suspect until she's found dead... in a wardrobe Maddie was moving upstairs. Then a teenage girl goes missing, after being seen going into the mansion rock star Roy Pilgrim was in... except that he was imprisoned for the past day, and didn't see her come in. Finally, an old friend of Jonathan's is found stabbed with a katana in a locked office... and no one came in or out.The core idea of ""Jonathan Creek"" is that if a brilliant, impossible crime were committed, it would take someone with ""inside-out"" thinking to figure it out. So we have some really weird crimes in here -- involving modern-day arks, gorillas, frogs, plastic surgery, an uninstalled toilet and a really bad case of arthritis.The only problem is that one or two of the cases are a wee bit far-fetched (a fatal object just happens to conveniently fall -- was that divine intervention?). But the crimes themselves are brilliantly thought out, and very simple once Jonathan has unraveled the facts. And the writers spin up plenty of comedy as well (Jonathan waiting for a gorilla to vacate the bathroom) as well as a dash of romance.Alan Davies puts in a great performance as Jonathan: shy, reclusive, reluctant and socially awkward, but with a special fascination for puzzles and mysteries. He's sort of like Adrian Monk but without the phobias and OCD. And Quentin is a delightful counterpoint to Davies -- she's as fiery, bombastic and outgoing as he is... not.Most mystery series dabble in the impossible crime, and ""Jonathan Creek - Season One"" takes it one step further by focusing on those crimes alone.",4,The magic of murder,1281139200,"08 7, 2010",2010,2712,"['murder', 'mysteries', 'killing', 'somebody', 'lot', 'smoke', 'mirrors', 'who', 'better', 'man', 'who', 'illusions', 'living', 'unravel', 'mysteries', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Season', 'One', 'idea', 'bizarre', 'British', 'aplomb', 'up', 'five', 'spectacularly', 'weird', 'murder', 'mysteries', 'where', 'nothing', 'famous', 'artist', 'found', 'murdered', 'bedroom', 'bound', 'gagged', 'mistress', 'lying', 'nearby', 'thought', 'be', 'robbery', 'gone', 'wrong', 'Journalist', 'Maddie', 'Magellan', 'Caroline', 'Quentin', 'convinced', 'fashion', 'mogul', 'wife', 'culprit', 'airtight', 'alibi.So', 'up', 'turning', 'rather', 'odd', 'acquaintance', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Alan', 'Davies', 'professional', 'creator', 'magic', 'tricks', 'knack', 'lateral', 'thinking', 'Jonathan', 'up', 'way', 'wife', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'deed', 'are', 'lot', 'clues', 'hint', 'murder', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'complex', 'that.After', 'famous', 'slapstick', 'comedian', 'found', 'shot', 'head', 'nuclear', 'bunker', 'was', ""n't"", 'physically', 'capable', 'shooting', 'A', 'plastic', 'surgeon', 'found', 'dead', 'famous', 'ex-lover', 'be', 'suspect', 'found', 'dead', 'wardrobe', 'Maddie', 'was', 'moving', 'upstairs', 'Then', 'teenage', 'girl', 'missing', 'being', 'seen', 'going', 'mansion', 'rock', 'star', 'Roy', 'Pilgrim', 'was', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'past', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'come', 'Finally', 'old', 'friend', 'Jonathan', 'found', 'stabbed', 'katana', 'locked', 'office', 'one', 'came', 'out.The', 'core', 'idea', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'brilliant', 'impossible', 'crime', 'were', 'committed', 'would', 'take', 'someone', 'inside-out', 'thinking', 'figure', 'out', 'have', 'really', 'weird', 'crimes', 'here', 'involving', 'modern-day', 'arks', 'gorillas', 'frogs', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'uninstalled', 'toilet', 'really', 'bad', 'case', 'arthritis.The', 'only', 'problem', 'one', 'two', 'cases', 'are', 'wee', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'fatal', 'object', 'just', 'conveniently', 'was', 'divine', 'intervention', 'crimes', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'thought', 'out', 'very', 'simple', 'once', 'Jonathan', 'unraveled', 'facts', 'writers', 'spin', 'up', 'plenty', 'comedy', 'well', 'Jonathan', 'waiting', 'gorilla', 'vacate', 'bathroom', 'as', 'well', 'dash', 'romance.Alan', 'Davies', 'great', 'performance', 'Jonathan', 'shy', 'reclusive', 'reluctant', 'socially', 'awkward', 'special', 'fascination', 'puzzles', 'mysteries', 'sort', 'like', 'Adrian', 'Monk', 'phobias', 'OCD', 'Quentin', 'delightful', 'counterpoint', 'Davies', 'as', 'fiery', 'bombastic', 'outgoing', 'not.Most', 'mystery', 'series', 'dabble', 'impossible', 'crime', 'Jonathan', 'Creek', 'Season', 'One', 'one', 'step', 'further', 'focusing', 'crimes', 'alone']",Jonathan Creek - Season One
1008388,A168VXSISJWQN9,B000GYI3MW,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[21, 21]","I'm so happy that season one of Jonathan Creek has been released in North America. This season, which features Alan Davies and Caroline Quentin (another reviewer refers to an actress and plot from shows which haven't been released yet) creates a wonderful relationship between the two stars. What appeals to me about the series is not the solutions to the mysteries. They are ingenious, but not always very plausible or, in some cases, original; Dorothy L. Sayers provided some of the inspiration for one of the stories in her book Busman's Honeymoon, written in 1935!What makes this series memorable is the clever and funny writing and the not-quite-fulfilled relationship between the lead characters. Jonathan, who devises stage illusions, is quiet and thoughtful, but has some great lines delivered with impeccable timing by Alan Davies, who cut his teeth as a comedian. His way of saying ""Hmmmm"" is priceless- you always know exactly what he means. Maddy, the journalist, is loud and vulgar and over the top, and Caroline Quentin plays her with great relish. The two make perfect foils for each other- by the end of the series the viewer is left wondering whether they will ever get together, but hoping that they will.The photography is beautiful, the locations outstanding (Jonathan lives in a windmill in Sussex) and the support players are of the usual high standard in BBC productions.

I have loved this show for years; I own the DVD box-set, and quite often I have an episode playing as background noise while I'm doing household chores. Brilliantly clever and incredibly funny, I never have any qualms about recommending ""Jonathan Creek"" to anyone - and have never had anyone give me negative feedback about it.The eponymous Jonathan is a lateral-thinking genius who - lacking confidence and social skills - designs stage illusions for the egotistical magician Adam Klaus. Madeline Magellan is a struggling investigative journalist who can't think of a decent hook for her latest book.Meeting one night at the theatre (after Jonathan accidentally skewers Maddy's hand with a toothpick, mistaking her thumb for a cocktail sausage) they realize each one has something the other needs. After the mysterious death of painter Hedley Shale, Maddy is called in by the main suspect to clear his name. But the only other suspect is Hedley's wife, whose motive could well be her jealousy over his affair with a beautiful young supermodel. But Serena Shale was in her office at the time of the murder, and her secretary attests that she never left the room.If only there was someone who could prove that she might have found a way to leave without being seen...Jonathan is a bit bewildered but intrigued by what Maddy proposes, and the two are them are soon surprised by just how effective a team they make. With his brain-power and her ability to bluff her way into nearly any situation, they investigate the deceased's wife and his mistress, finding that there's a lot more to the case than the police realize.Season one of ""Jonathan Creek"" is comprised of five episodes, with its pilot (""The Wrestler's Tomb"") running for ninety minutes as opposed to the usual forty-five. This set also includes ""Jack in the Box"", a mystery in which a man with crippling arthritis is found shot dead in a nuclear fall-out shelter, the victim of an apparent suicide. But as his wife points out, he could barely pour a drink let alone load and fire a gun - but how could the killer get out of a sealed underground bunker?""The Reconstituted Corpse"" involves plastic-goddess Zola Zbzewski arrested for the murder of her cosmetic surgeon David Churchin, a jilted lover swearing to destroy her. The discovery of a Peeping Tom's camera might provide her with an alibi, but then a shocking discovery is found in Maddy's new wardrobe - and figuring out how the heck it got there might explain just what happened to Churchin.""No Trace of Tracey"" is one of my favourites. A teenage girl is invited to visit the home of rock god Roy Pilgrim, but though she's seen by a number of schoolboys entering his house through a pair of screen doors, Roy swears that he was the victim of a home invasion that left him handcuffed to a radiator. And in all the hours he was stuck there, nothing came through the screen doors but a small frog. Both stories can't possibly be true - but Jonathan has a solution.""The House of Monkeys"" is another classic locked-room mystery in which a scientist is found in his study, a Samurai sword through his heart. His Dictaphone reveals that there was someone in the room with him only seconds before his wife knocks at the door, but the only available witnesses would seem to be the family's menagerie of monkeys.All of the mysteries present what appear to be impossible scenarios in regards to how a crime took place, but truly ingenious solutions that gives all the episodes a rewatchable quality. I guarantee you'll watch this show at least twice, just to pick up on all the clues that are strewn throughout each story; details as innocuous as a pair of stereo-speakers that are switched around, or a chewed-up envelope left in a wastepaper bin.And then there are our lead characters. Between Jonathan's snarky introspection and Maddy's loud-mouthed blather, the two of them are one of the most dynamic crime-fighting couples in television history. Alan Davies and Caroline Quentin have sublime chemistry together, and David Renwick's witty scripts ensure that their constant bickering remains fresh and humorous. Almost every word out of their mouths is a quotable gem, from Jonathan's sardonic comments to Maddy's sarcastic replies.I've watch this show dozens of times, and there's still plenty of life in them. Every time I notice some added detail or quirky background gag that I was overlooked the first few times around, and Renwick's wonderful plotting is superb, in which he sows the seeds of the mystery, introduces all the suspects, and then builds up to the denouement with incredible panache.Like I said, I love this show - and it's one of the very few shows out there that I have no qualms about recommending. In terms of its humour and cleverness, it's very difficult to imagine anyone who wouldn't enjoy watching it.",5,"""Right Now?
