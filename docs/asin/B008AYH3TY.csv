1549349,A2SSKER1T8047B,B008AYH3TY,Riaan,"[5, 9]","This is getting tiresome. Lewis Black used to be at the cutting edge of comedy. Pick up any of his albums between 2000 and 2005. His animated and psychotic rants will have you in stitches. During the past few years we've seen increasingly unfunny releases from Lewis in both The Carnegie Hall Performance (2006) and Stark Raving Black (2009), which were both recorded in large venues.Sorry, but certain comics aren't suited for the big stage. Lewis is one of them. Even Black himself quipped during ""Carnegie Hall..."" that ""I don't belong here and you don't belong here"". It was a joke, of course, but it couldn't have been further from the truth. Lewis is ten times funnier when he performs in a club, which is an intimate setting that provides timing nuances that are perfectly suited to his style of comedy.On ""In God We Rust"" Lewis seems to be going through the phases in a sort of unruffled, reflective mood. The calm moments are dull, dull, dull. The loud moments are - as you'd expect - flashes of rage exploding in a fit of unbridled anger. In the past, these fits of fury sort of ebbed and flowed during his routine, keeping you on edge, here they come off as just mere loud moments. Yelling for yelling's sake.There are micro moments of magic here, especially towards the end. The bit about Farmville is good. The rest of the material is just painful to watch. There are people who still enjoy the comedy of Lewis Black. Good for them.
