Andersen,"[7, 9]","As with my best film of last year, MEET JOE BLACK, reviews are pretty much split down the middle by those who did understand it and those who didn't.  The latter hate it while an elite group love it.  I was not expecting to  be overwhelmed but I was.  This is an intensely rich work of art which uses  the best screen language from cinematography through editing, score and  sound to create a haunting love story quite unlike any other I've ever  seen.  It is almost mythic and therefore no actor stands out - it's all a  seamless fabric of emotion and beauty.  I have given it my personal  awards for BEST FILM, BEST DIRECTION, BEST SCREENPLAY, BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY,  BEST SCORE and BEST EDITING.  For romantics it is heaven sent.

Seldom does one see such a  powerfully depicted drama that also features the level of artistic  accomplishment in terms of cinematography, accomplished acting, and general  story line. Taken from the best-selling novel of the same name, this  spellbinding tale of love, mystery and intrigue is set in the Pacific  Northwest in the time period right after the end of World War Two, and  deals with the undercurrents of deep-seated racism against a group of  ethnic Japanese who had made their home for decades on the island depicted  in the movie, and who were in many ways the most terribly and unjustly  mistreated group within the United States during the war.The movie  version of the story is extremely well-told, and Ethan Hawke shows he has  the chops to be a major star in his brilliant portrayal of the central  figure in the unraveling of the mystery. Likewise, Sam Shepard and the rest  of the cast does a sterling job in presenting this drama in a magnificently  photographed and choreographed depiction of life and death in the sleepy  little harbor where it all unfolds. One of the other reviewers mentioned  the way in which the director has used his ability to interweave various  elements such as the photography and the acting to spin his tale  masterfully, and I have to agree the sum total of this effort is certainly  much greater than the parts; the net result is simply terrific. This is a  movie that deals with a painful aspect of American history quite well  without either looking for easy answers or contriving convenient solutions,  but it does manage to let us know that the only way to end such prejudice  and fateful discrimination is through individual effort and personal  growth.

68814,A9ETDX5K04DY,0783240325,"Billy J. Hobbs ""Bill Hobbs""","[4, 4]","To rate a movie using the original book as the guideline is perhaps not fair to the film--after all, they are two different media.In &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars,&quot; one is first gripped by the phenomenal  cinematography.  To review a VHS edition based upon what one sees on the  Big Screen is also not valid.  In this case, much of the effect is lost  when the movie is &quot;formatted to fit your TV.&quot;  That being said,  however, even with the deletion of the panorama, the photography still is  this film's best attribute. Certainly, the photographers enhance the Zen  utilized in the film to great success.  The music is scored to enhance the  visual effects and it, too, triumphs.  At times, we find the photography as  haiku--and very well &quot;written&quot; indeed!These aspects aside, the  film founders heavily--it lists to starboard before it is over.  Up through  the actual trial, there is hope for this exceptional film; however, the  director chooses to use Melodrama (with a capital M) as rescuer. Melodrama,  in its place, perhaps, is admissable, but great films avoid it, and the  trial's easy come, easy go &quot;solution&quot; and accompanying reactions  are simply that:  melodrama.  This seriously mars the film (that and Ethan  Hawke in the top billing role).  Fortunately, the overall acting is saved  by Max von Sydow, the aging attorney, standing for truth and justice for  all. Granted, the film's attack on racism (this toward the Japanese  following Pearl Harbor) is right on.Certainly, this theme is stressed in  most effective ways and the viewer is left with a feeling that the defiled  is vindicated.Granted, too, the book is excellent--but it is a book;  this is a film and one &quot;shouldn't have to have read ANY book&quot; to  appreciate a film.(Billyjhobbs@tyler.net)",3,The snow falls with only one hand clapping!,962150400,"06 28, 2000",2000,1814,"['rate', 'movie', 'using', 'original', 'book', 'guideline', 'perhaps', 'not', 'fair', 'film', 'are', 'two', 'different', 'media.In', 'quot', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'quot', 'one', 'first', 'gripped', 'phenomenal', 'cinematography', 'review', 'VHS', 'edition', 'based', 'what', 'one', 'Big', 'Screen', 'also', 'not', 'valid', 'case', 'much', 'effect', 'lost', 'when', 'movie', 'quot', 'formatted', 'fit', 'TV.', 'quot', 'being', 'said', 'however', 'even', 'deletion', 'panorama', 'photography', 'still', 'film', 'best', 'attribute', 'Certainly', 'photographers', 'enhance', 'Zen', 'utilized', 'film', 'great', 'success', 'music', 'scored', 'enhance', 'visual', 'effects', 'too', 'triumphs', 'times', 'find', 'photography', 'haiku', 'very', 'well', 'quot', 'written', 'quot', 'indeed', 'aspects', 'aside', 'film', 'founders', 'heavily', 'starboard', 'over', 'Up', 'actual', 'trial', 'hope', 'exceptional', 'film', 'however', 'director', 'use', 'Melodrama', 'capital', 'M', 'rescuer', 'Melodrama', 'place', 'perhaps', 'admissable', 'great', 'films', 'avoid', 'trial', 'easy', 'come', 'easy', 'go', 'quot', 'solution', 'quot', 'accompanying', 'reactions', 'are', 'simply', 'melodrama', 'seriously', 'film', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'top', 'billing', 'role', 'Fortunately', 'overall', 'acting', 'saved', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'aging', 'attorney', 'standing', 'truth', 'justice', 'Granted', 'film', 'attack', 'racism', 'Japanese', 'following', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'right', 'on.Certainly', 'theme', 'stressed', 'most', 'effective', 'ways', 'viewer', 'left', 'feeling', 'defiled', 'vindicated.Granted', 'too', 'book', 'excellent', 'book', 'film', 'one', 'quot', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'read', 'ANY', 'book', 'quot', 'appreciate', 'film', 'Billyjhobbs', '@', 'tyler.net']",N/A
68815,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,0783240325,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[20, 23]","I read a review of this film a few years ago who's title was ""Snow Falling Very Slowly on Cedars"". It is somewhat appropriate, I guess, especially with today's instant gratification society coming to the forefront. With stellar action sequences in films like Star Wars and the like, films that build on characters and their lives tend to get less-than-gratifying reviews. Add to this that this film had quite a few historical references in it, and you've doomed it to be a ""ploddingly slow film"".But nothing could be further from the truth...The textures of this film are pretty darn impressive. There's a love story, a murder investigation, beautifully sculpted scenery (at sea and on land), war, concentration camps in America (disguised as ""relocation camps""), prejudice, and a court battle, all rolled into this one simple film. And, quite amazingly, the film doesn't unravel. With all of these layers, the director (Scott Hicks, Shine), pulls off a stunning feat of visual candy and artistic sound.The story is based on David Guterson's best selling novel by the same name, and Mr. Guterson was directly responsible for the script writing of the film (which is probably why the movie held together so well). It takes place in the 1950's where Kazuo, a Japanese-American, is on trial for the murder of Carl Heine, a white Norwegian fisherman. Coming off the heals of WW II, the trial is ready to ignite into a free-for-all of racial tensions. Americans still scorn all the Japanese for the destruction of Pearl Harbor (doesn't matter if you were a U.S. citizen at the time or not), and the Japanese-Americans remain bitter for being forced into ""relocation/internment camps"" in California and beyond (many Japanese-Americans lost everything they had during these ""relocations""). But tempering the heat of the trial is a terrible blizzard raging around this small island in the San Juans (Washington State) where the story unfolds.The film brushes us back and forth between the trial of Kazuo, WWII (during which Kazuo was a soldier fighting for the U.S.), a love story between an American boy, Ishmael (Ethan Hawke) and a VERY pretty Japanese girl named, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), who will eventually forsake their young love and marry the very man who is on trial for murder, Kazuo.Ishmael loses his right arm in the war and comes back doubly embittered at life. Not only did Hatsue leave him for one of her own, but a Japanese battle caused the loss of his limb. Now he's on the little island and covering the trial as a newspaper reporter, and his memories of the past intrude on the trials machinations. When he discovers some information that could clear Kazuo of the crime, can he let that information come out? Or will his battle-worn heart, soul, and body prevent it? Or perhaps his aching love of Hatsue will stop him (hoping that Kazuo is found guilty and sent away, thus allowing him to have a second chance at Hatsue)?As you can see just from this simple review, the layers go deep, cutting, biting, and tearing into the flesh of the characters, all of whom are flawed, broken, and, quite possibly, reborn again as a full human being.Notable amongst the cast is Ethan Hawke as Ishmael, Yoki Kudo as Hatsue, Max von Sydow as Nels (the curmudgeonly but affable defense attorney), James Cromwell as the sympathetic Judge Fielding, and Sam Shepard as Arthur Chambers (Ishmael's father and mentor).A must see film for those interesting in characters, their flaws, their successes, and just being true to the human spirit.",5,Being Hurt and Being Human,1110499200,"03 11, 2005",2005,3528,"['read', 'review', 'film', 'few', 'years', 'who', 'title', 'was', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Very', 'Slowly', 'Cedars', 'somewhat', 'appropriate', 'guess', 'especially', 'today', 'instant', 'gratification', 'society', 'coming', 'forefront', 'stellar', 'action', 'sequences', 'films', 'Star', 'Wars', 'like', 'films', 'build', 'characters', 'lives', 'tend', 'get', 'less-than-gratifying', 'reviews', 'Add', 'film', 'had', 'quite', 'few', 'historical', 'references', ""'ve"", 'doomed', 'be', 'ploddingly', 'slow', 'film', '.But', 'nothing', 'could', 'be', 'further', 'truth', 'textures', 'film', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'impressive', 'love', 'story', 'murder', 'investigation', 'beautifully', 'sculpted', 'scenery', 'sea', 'land', 'war', 'concentration', 'camps', 'America', 'disguised', 'relocation', 'camps', 'prejudice', 'court', 'battle', 'rolled', 'one', 'simple', 'film', 'quite', 'amazingly', 'film', ""n't"", 'unravel', 'layers', 'director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'Shine', 'stunning', 'feat', 'visual', 'candy', 'artistic', 'sound.The', 'story', 'based', 'David', 'Guterson', 'best', 'selling', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'Mr.', 'Guterson', 'was', 'directly', 'responsible', 'script', 'writing', 'film', 'probably', 'why', 'movie', 'held', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'place', '1950', 'where', 'Kazuo', 'Japanese-American', 'trial', 'murder', 'Carl', 'Heine', 'white', 'Norwegian', 'fisherman', 'Coming', 'off', 'heals', 'WW', 'II', 'trial', 'ready', 'ignite', 'free-for-all', 'racial', 'tensions', 'Americans', 'still', 'scorn', 'Japanese', 'destruction', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', ""n't"", 'matter', 'were', 'U.S.', 'citizen', 'time', 'not', 'Japanese-Americans', 'remain', 'bitter', 'being', 'forced', 'relocation/internment', 'camps', 'California', 'many', 'Japanese-Americans', 'lost', 'everything', 'had', 'relocations', 'tempering', 'heat', 'trial', 'terrible', 'blizzard', 'raging', 'small', 'island', 'San', 'Juans', 'Washington', 'State', 'where', 'story', 'unfolds.The', 'film', 'brushes', 'back', 'forth', 'trial', 'Kazuo', 'WWII', 'Kazuo', 'was', 'soldier', 'fighting', 'U.S.', 'love', 'story', 'American', 'boy', 'Ishmael', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'VERY', 'pretty', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'named', 'Hatsue', 'Youki', 'Kudoh', 'who', 'will', 'eventually', 'forsake', 'young', 'love', 'marry', 'very', 'man', 'who', 'trial', 'murder', 'Kazuo.Ishmael', 'right', 'arm', 'war', 'back', 'doubly', 'embittered', 'life', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'Hatsue', 'leave', 'one', 'own', 'Japanese', 'battle', 'caused', 'loss', 'limb', 'Now', 'little', 'island', 'covering', 'trial', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'memories', 'past', 'intrude', 'trials', 'machinations', 'When', 'information', 'could', 'clear', 'Kazuo', 'crime', 'can', 'let', 'information', 'come', 'out', 'will', 'battle-worn', 'heart', 'soul', 'body', 'prevent', 'perhaps', 'aching', 'love', 'Hatsue', 'will', 'stop', 'hoping', 'Kazuo', 'found', 'guilty', 'sent', 'away', 'thus', 'allowing', 'have', 'second', 'chance', 'Hatsue', 'can', 'see', 'just', 'simple', 'review', 'layers', 'go', 'deep', 'cutting', 'biting', 'tearing', 'flesh', 'characters', 'whom', 'are', 'flawed', 'broken', 'quite', 'possibly', 'reborn', 'again', 'full', 'human', 'being.Notable', 'cast', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Ishmael', 'Yoki', 'Kudo', 'Hatsue', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Nels', 'curmudgeonly', 'affable', 'defense', 'attorney', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'sympathetic', 'Judge', 'Fielding', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Arthur', 'Chambers', 'Ishmael', 'father', 'mentor', '.A', 'must', 'see', 'film', 'interesting', 'characters', 'flaws', 'successes', 'just', 'being', 'true', 'human', 'spirit']",N/A

This is very unusual for me as it is usually the reverse situation. What I  liked best is epitomized on the cover of the box.  It shows the heroine as  a child and the hero as an adult, even though, in the film, they are at all  times the same age.  The film, however, shifts atmospherically from their  shared life together as children, adolescents and lovers to their lives as  full adults. The hero is having a harder time letting go of that shared  time together than she is. As adults of around thirty, they are as apart as  they once were together. Her same-race (Japanese American) husband is on  trial in their town for murdering a local fisherman.  The hero is bitterly  alone and has taken over his late father's newspaper. That he lost his arm  fighting in World War II is part of his bitterness. The trial is the  weakest part of the film and I could have done with much less of it. The  rest of the film is so beautifully brought to the screen that it is  annoying when the &quot;typical&quot; trial scenes play.  Normally I love  Max Van Sydow, the trial lawyer, but I could have even dispensed with him.  Gorgeous cinematography enhances this film greatly.

68820,ACJVGDN8G386P,0783240325,"classicalsteve ""classicalsteve""","[0, 0]","In &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34;, a man, Tom Robinson, is accused of rape, largely because he is African-American, and because he was kissed by a white woman in the rural 1930's South. In &#34;Snow Falling on Cedars&#34;, a Japanese-American in the Northwest is accused of murder because a white fisherman is found dead in his fishing net not long after World War II. The setting is in the wake of racial animosity because of the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The case is largely brought forth because of prejudicial attitudes prevalent at the time rather than strong evidence. (Ironically, German-Americans did not suffer the same fate as the Japanese during the same period.) The brilliance of the film, which I assume is more or less faithful to the book, is its handling of several separate but intertwined stories. At the forefront is the murder trial of Kazuo Miyamoto, a young Japanese-American in the 1950's who fought on the American side of World War II, played brilliantly understated by Rick Yune. He is accused of murdering Carl Heine, a fellow fisherman, who now has land previously owned by Japanese who were forced to give it up (as well as most of their possessions) when they were unjustly forced into interment camps on the West Coast.The other stories involve Hatsue Miyamoto (played wonderfully by Youki Kudoh) and Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke in possibly his best performance since &#34;Reality Bites&#34;) as star-crossed lovers before adulthood. We learn, largely through flash-backs, that the American white boy and Japanese girl met and fell in love on the eve of Japanese-American internment. Their story parallels the later court case, and the loss of their relationship is because of the racial divides imposed by the US Government, fearing that all Japanese-Americans were suspect because of their ancestry, rather than any evidence they were actually secretly in conspiracy with the Japanese Empire. The love between Hatsue and Ishmael is told through flash-backs. Hatsue is now the wife of the accused, and Ishmael has followed in the footsteps of his father and become a reporter and journalist. We learn that Ishmael still has strong feelings for the woman who once loved him when they were but children, but he is side-lined from their lives.Like &#34;Mockingbird&#34;, &#34;Cedars&#34; is largely about the tragedy of prejudice and racism. One aspect of the story which emerges, possibly not consciously, is how the Japanese-Americans are largely similar to their white counterparts. They like much of the popular American music of the 1940's, they play games, they enjoy good food and wine. Of course, their interests in Buddhism are different, but I believe the point of the story is that the similarities between cultures are often overlooked in favor of our few differences. Although most of the focus is on the white community being wary of their Japanese neighbors, in a poignant scene, the young Hatsue is told by her good-intentioned mother that her daughter should not look at white boys, and should marry a Japanese boy. So prejudice cuts in both directions, often with tragic results. Some of the most heinous crimes in human history are perpetrated out of fear. And if someday, we could let go of our fears of &#34;the other&#34;, maybe the world would be a better place.",5,A Brilliant West-Coast Version of To Kill a Mockingbird with a little bit of Romeo and Juliet Thrown In,1385942400,"12 2, 2013",2013,3346,"['34', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', '34', 'man', 'Tom', 'Robinson', 'accused', 'rape', 'largely', 'African-American', 'was', 'kissed', 'white', 'woman', 'rural', '1930', 'South', '34', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', '34', 'Japanese-American', 'Northwest', 'accused', 'murder', 'white', 'fisherman', 'found', 'dead', 'fishing', 'net', 'not', 'long', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'setting', 'wake', 'racial', 'animosity', 'internment', 'Japanese-Americans', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'case', 'largely', 'brought', 'forth', 'prejudicial', 'attitudes', 'prevalent', 'time', 'rather', 'strong', 'evidence', 'Ironically', 'German-Americans', 'did', 'not', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate', 'Japanese', 'same', 'period', 'brilliance', 'film', 'assume', 'more', 'less', 'faithful', 'book', 'handling', 'several', 'separate', 'intertwined', 'stories', 'forefront', 'murder', 'trial', 'Kazuo', 'Miyamoto', 'young', 'Japanese-American', '1950', 'who', 'fought', 'American', 'side', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'understated', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'accused', 'murdering', 'Carl', 'Heine', 'fellow', 'fisherman', 'who', 'now', 'land', 'previously', 'owned', 'Japanese', 'who', 'were', 'forced', 'give', 'up', 'as', 'well', 'most', 'possessions', 'when', 'were', 'unjustly', 'forced', 'interment', 'camps', 'West', 'Coast.The', 'other', 'stories', 'involve', 'Hatsue', 'Miyamoto', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Youki', 'Kudoh', 'Ishmael', 'Chambers', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', '34', 'Reality', 'Bites', '34', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'adulthood', 'learn', 'largely', 'flash-backs', 'American', 'white', 'boy', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'met', 'fell', 'love', 'eve', 'Japanese-American', 'internment', 'story', 'later', 'court', 'case', 'loss', 'relationship', 'racial', 'divides', 'imposed', 'US', 'Government', 'fearing', 'Japanese-Americans', 'were', 'suspect', 'ancestry', 'rather', 'evidence', 'were', 'actually', 'secretly', 'conspiracy', 'Japanese', 'Empire', 'love', 'Hatsue', 'Ishmael', 'told', 'flash-backs', 'Hatsue', 'now', 'wife', 'accused', 'Ishmael', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'father', 'become', 'reporter', 'journalist', 'learn', 'Ishmael', 'still', 'strong', 'feelings', 'woman', 'who', 'once', 'loved', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'side-lined', 'lives.Like', '34', 'Mockingbird', '34', '34', 'Cedars', '34', 'largely', 'tragedy', 'prejudice', 'racism', 'One', 'aspect', 'story', 'possibly', 'not', 'consciously', 'how', 'Japanese-Americans', 'are', 'largely', 'similar', 'white', 'counterparts', 'like', 'much', 'popular', 'American', 'music', '1940', 'play', 'games', 'enjoy', 'good', 'food', 'wine', 'course', 'interests', 'Buddhism', 'are', 'different', 'believe', 'point', 'story', 'similarities', 'cultures', 'are', 'often', 'overlooked', 'favor', 'few', 'differences', 'most', 'focus', 'white', 'community', 'being', 'wary', 'Japanese', 'neighbors', 'poignant', 'scene', 'young', 'Hatsue', 'told', 'good-intentioned', 'mother', 'daughter', 'should', 'not', 'look', 'white', 'boys', 'should', 'marry', 'Japanese', 'boy', 'So', 'prejudice', 'cuts', 'directions', 'often', 'tragic', 'results', 'most', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'human', 'history', 'are', 'perpetrated', 'fear', 'someday', 'could', 'let', 'go', 'fears', '34', 'other', '34', 'maybe', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'place']",N/A

It's long, dreary, confussing and at times very boring.  That said, the storyline, which I was completly unaware of when renting the film, is not too shaby.  It takes place on one of Washington State's San Juan Islands where the weather is always cold, damp, snowing and yes...dreary.  Here is where a Japanese American war hero (Rick Yune, 'The Fast and the Furious') is accused of murdering a white fisherman for his land.  The man's only hope is the testimony of an American journalist (Ethan Hawke, 'Training Day') who just may have figured out the real events leading up to the mans death, but there is something holding him back from testifying.  It's his bitter-love for the accused wife (Youki Kudoh, 'Memiors of a Geisha').  They grew up together and were once lovers, but their racial differences forced them apart.  Set in the 1950's shortly after WWII when the Japanese were hated by most American's the injustice is shown in the treatment of the trial and of the accused, and through flashbacks we can see how everyone was affected by the Pearl Harbor incident and so-on.  The film as a whole, the idea and the acting is decent, at times brilliant, but with all the flashbacks it becomes difficult to understand whats really going on.

68823,A2P49WD75WHAG5,0783240325,Daniel J. Hamlow,"[33, 36]","I can attest to the adage that the first person one falls in love with is forever, regardless of whether that person gets married to someone else or not.  Well, in Snow Falling On Cedars, that sort of past comes back to haunt young reporter Ishmael Chambers when he discovers the husband of his first love Hatsue is being tried for the murder of fisherman/husband/father Carl Heine.  The case for the prosecution is that Kazuo, Hatsue's husband, murdered Carl with a flat wooden object, such as a kendo stick (wooden swords used in stick fighting), and all because of the loss of seven acres of land owned by Kazuo's father when Kazuo's family was interned during WW2.  Kazuo had demanded the return of the land, but because of two payments missed, his family forfeited the land, which came into Carl's possession.  He is defended by an elderly lawyer, Nels Gudmundsson (veteran Swedish actor Max von Sydow in a strong performance), who as a Scandinavian, detects the race issue here.  Pearl Harbor has not been forgotten, in other words.  All the while, Ishmael sits high up on the balcony of the trial room, observing the defendant and his wife.  He is clearly still bitter about the past, as he might have ended up with Hatsue had not circumstances dictated otherwise.  This bitterness is manifested when he sits on some information key to Kazuo's defense.Set in the fishing village of San Piedro, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, the film shuttles back and forth between the present, in the 1950's, and the past, in the late 30's to 40's.  The film shows Ishmael falling in love with Hatsue Imada, a Japanese girl, and both their mothers disapproving of interracial relationships.  The overall overcast setting lends to the forboding, oppressive atmosphere, but it works well in the forest, where Hatsue has a little hidey hole in the depths of a large cedar tree, a clandestine meeting place for the young lovers.  However, the dizzying array of echoed and repeated voices, and montages connecting various bits of the past can be rather trying.Of course, the attack on Pearl Harbor stirs up anti-Japanese sentiments, setting the stage for what has been called the largest wholesale violation of civil rights in US history:  the rounding up of Japanese-Americans from their homes, confiscation of anything traditional, called &quot;old country&quot;, and mass deportation to camps like Manzanar, which is the camp the Miyamotos end up in.However, Ishmael's father, Arthur, the editor of the local paper, is very progressive, and protests the roundups, which leads to threatening calls and cancellations of subscriptions.  At the time of the trial, his father has died, and he discovers to his discomfort that his father's liberal reputation is overshadowing him.The Japanese traditions of girls being groomed to be graceful, e.g. sitting on one's knees without moving, the wearing of kimonos, etc. is something my late mother could relate to, as she too was Japanese.  Hatsue's mother is one forbidding her relationship to Ishmael.  Similarly, my mother's father, had he lived, would never have allowed her to marry my father, otherwise your humble reviewer's race would have been different.While Ethan Hawke does well as the brooding Ishmael, he's overshadowed by other performers, such as von Sydow, Youki Koudoh (Hatsue), and Sam Shepard (Arthur Chambers).  As the film progresses, one begins to understand his bitterness.I haven't read Guterson's novel, so I don't know how closely the movie follows it.  Regardless, it's a slow-paced movie, but not grabbing at times;  somehow, the mixture of adolescent romance, and racial courtroom drama that lacks punch.  But the message of learning to let go of the past, and the conditions that would allow one to let go, comes through towards the end.",4,How the bitterness of the past can haunt one in the present,1088812800,"07 3, 2004",2004,3803,"['can', 'attest', 'adage', 'first', 'person', 'one', 'love', 'forever', 'regardless', 'person', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'not', 'Well', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'sort', 'past', 'back', 'haunt', 'young', 'reporter', 'Ishmael', 'Chambers', 'when', 'husband', 'first', 'love', 'Hatsue', 'being', 'tried', 'murder', 'fisherman/husband/father', 'Carl', 'Heine', 'case', 'prosecution', 'Kazuo', 'Hatsue', 'husband', 'murdered', 'Carl', 'flat', 'wooden', 'object', 'such', 'kendo', 'stick', 'wooden', 'swords', 'used', 'stick', 'fighting', 'loss', 'seven', 'acres', 'land', 'owned', 'Kazuo', 'father', 'when', 'Kazuo', 'family', 'was', 'interned', 'WW2', 'Kazuo', 'had', 'demanded', 'return', 'land', 'two', 'payments', 'missed', 'family', 'forfeited', 'land', 'came', 'Carl', 'possession', 'defended', 'elderly', 'lawyer', 'Nels', 'Gudmundsson', 'veteran', 'Swedish', 'actor', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'strong', 'performance', 'who', 'Scandinavian', 'race', 'issue', 'here', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'not', 'been', 'forgotten', 'other', 'words', 'while', 'Ishmael', 'high', 'up', 'balcony', 'trial', 'room', 'observing', 'defendant', 'wife', 'clearly', 'still', 'bitter', 'past', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'Hatsue', 'had', 'not', 'circumstances', 'dictated', 'otherwise', 'bitterness', 'manifested', 'when', 'information', 'key', 'Kazuo', 'defense.Set', 'fishing', 'village', 'San', 'Piedro', 'somewhere', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'film', 'back', 'forth', 'present', '1950', 'past', 'late', '30', '40', 'film', 'Ishmael', 'falling', 'love', 'Hatsue', 'Imada', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'mothers', 'disapproving', 'interracial', 'relationships', 'overall', 'overcast', 'setting', 'lends', 'forboding', 'oppressive', 'atmosphere', 'well', 'forest', 'where', 'Hatsue', 'little', 'hidey', 'hole', 'depths', 'large', 'cedar', 'tree', 'clandestine', 'meeting', 'place', 'young', 'lovers', 'However', 'dizzying', 'array', 'echoed', 'repeated', 'voices', 'montages', 'connecting', 'various', 'bits', 'past', 'can', 'be', 'rather', 'trying.Of', 'course', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'up', 'anti-Japanese', 'sentiments', 'setting', 'stage', 'what', 'been', 'called', 'largest', 'wholesale', 'violation', 'civil', 'rights', 'US', 'history', 'rounding', 'Japanese-Americans', 'homes', 'confiscation', 'anything', 'traditional', 'called', 'quot', 'old', 'country', 'quot', 'mass', 'deportation', 'camps', 'Manzanar', 'camp', 'Miyamotos', 'end', 'up', 'in.However', 'Ishmael', 'father', 'Arthur', 'editor', 'local', 'paper', 'very', 'progressive', 'roundups', 'threatening', 'calls', 'cancellations', 'subscriptions', 'time', 'trial', 'father', 'died', 'discomfort', 'father', 'liberal', 'reputation', 'overshadowing', 'him.The', 'Japanese', 'traditions', 'girls', 'being', 'groomed', 'be', 'graceful', 'e.g', 'sitting', 'one', 'knees', 'moving', 'wearing', 'kimonos', 'etc', 'something', 'late', 'mother', 'could', 'relate', 'too', 'was', 'Japanese', 'Hatsue', 'mother', 'one', 'forbidding', 'relationship', 'Ishmael', 'Similarly', 'mother', 'father', 'had', 'lived', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'allowed', 'marry', 'father', 'otherwise', 'humble', 'reviewer', 'race', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'different.While', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'well', 'brooding', 'Ishmael', 'overshadowed', 'other', 'performers', 'such', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Youki', 'Koudoh', 'Hatsue', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'Arthur', 'Chambers', 'film', 'one', 'understand', 'bitterness.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'Guterson', 'novel', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'closely', 'movie', 'Regardless', 'slow-paced', 'movie', 'not', 'grabbing', 'times', 'somehow', 'mixture', 'adolescent', 'romance', 'racial', 'courtroom', 'drama', 'punch', 'message', 'learning', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'conditions', 'would', 'allow', 'one', 'let', 'go', 'towards', 'end']",N/A

Loftus,"[10, 13]","I remember enjoying the novel on which this film is based very much, except for a nagging feeling that it was just too perfect: it touched all the politically correct bases with regard to the Japanese-American  internment, and the plot twist necessary to create the murder mystery (or  rather, the key to its solution) seemed just too exactly coincidental.  (Sloppiness and poor communication would have served; life's like that.)  Its true achievement was in its evocation of place: the majestic  evergreens, the deep forest, the rain and snow of the Pacific  Northwest.This movie makes some of the same errors.  It's just too  darned beautiful, which detracts from its effectiveness (or maybe throws  its weaknesses in high relief).  Ethan Hawke does a creditable job as its  hero -- he has an old-fashioned handsomeness that is appropriate for the  period (as does Sam Shepard as his father).  I like to see him get  work.The sequence of the Japanese-Americans leaving the island for the  camps drags on interminably to wring out every last tear (and I'm in a  unique position to complain, since my mother and most of her family spent  the war in those camps, while two of my uncles fought in the US Army in the  Pacific Theater).

68825,A2198FZZMTJ38H,0783240325,D. Litton,"[10, 11]","There's something magical about dreamy landscapes and lush settings where complex stories take place. Movies with this advantage tend to wrap their viewers in a rich blanket of visual and auditory imagery, bringing them further into the story while dazzling the senses. &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; is like an unfolding dream, one with snowy hills and trees and a meticulous ensemble of stunning images with a warm heart pulsating throughout its story. Scott Hicks' 1999 film version of David Guterson's acclaimed novel is every bit as moving and powerful as its source material, while also becoming something richer and deeper.The complexity of this movie is what pleases me the most, because every Hicks is able to take the novel's different stories and tie them all together to one another as the author intended. The movie opens when police find a fisherman caught in his own net on a crystal clear lake surrounded by ice-capped mountains all around. Upon reaching the docks, the police start asking questions about the man's whereabouts the night before. Moving ahead, a trial begins, and we learn that a Japanese fisherman, Kabuo Miyamoto, is on trial for the murder of the deceased, Carl Heine. Attending the trial is his wife, Hatsure Imada Miyamoto, and the local paper's owner and sole reporter, Ishmael Chambers, who has a past with the defendant's wife.The trial takes place in the winter, as the snow is just beginning to fall in San Piedro Island, on the northwest shores of the United States. It is home to thousands of Japanese immigrants who had migrated to the country from their homeland before the United States' entrance into World War II. This furthers the story as we watch through flashbacks the herding of the Japanese residents to internment camps in the nearby state of Washington. And amidst all the turmoil of memories brought up by the trial, Ishmael and Hatsue are forced to remember the time they shared as children and teenagers, playing together on the beach and beginning a relationship that was considered inappropriate at the time by both their familes and friends.Each of these plots all become interconnected through the trial of Kabuo Miyamoto, which can seem a bit draggy at times, but never fails in its knowledge of court proceedings and moments of tension. For the most part, the trial is very interesting, but it is the intense and passionate relationship that Ishmael and Hatsue relive in their memories that keeps the drama of this film moving. Their relationship is seen in so many different lights: we see it through the eyes of they themselves (Ishmael cares not for what others might think, while Hatsue is more reserved about her feelings towards the relationship), as well as quietly seeing it through the eyes of their parents, who each have some moment in the movie where they voice their opposing opinions about having relationships with their own ethnic group as opposed to a differing one. Their passionate journies together on the beach, picking strawberries and among the cedar trees will sweep you up and carry you away as you lose yourself into their romance.While being a fictional piece, there is also a great deal of history residing in this film's plot. Like the book, the movie tells of the movement to rush Japanese residents of the United States to internment camps after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941. While the movie does not capture all of the occurences and feeling that the book portrays when the Japanese are being investigated all over the island, upon further examination, you'll find that it's not really needed. The focus of the film at that time is the impending separation of Ishmael and Hatsue as she is about to go off to the camps and he is drafted soon after. They will see one another once before leaving, a quick glance, which is one of the most moving moments in motion picture history.There is so much empowerment and moving epic storytelling in a like this, partly because there is so much to tell, and partly because the filmmakers choose to tell the story in a more-than-conventional way. Instead of taking a direct approach to focusing on just the characters themselves, director Hicks and director of photography Robert Richardson choose to add focus to the island setting itself, incorporating vast shots of the beauty of the snowy town to show the conditions the people live in, furthering the emotional factor of the story while also giving the viewer a sense that there is much isolation and loneliness in certain scenes where its impact is prudent to the plot. James Newton Howard has also set an entire new precedent in the art of music making, and his score for &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; is moving, brilliant, and adds nothing but visceral and enticing chords and haunting melodies that serve as the biggest aspect of striking the emotions of the audience.I tried envisioning a better acting cast for this movie after seeing it, and will admit that I thought of a few people to play different roles, but soon realized that it would change the entire feeling of the story. Ethan Hawke is perfectly fit for the role of Ishmael. He is such a wonderful actor, and his ability to show emotions of sadness and despair with such authenticity make him a perfect casting choice for the role. Youki Kudoh, playing the character of Hatsue, is the total embodiment of innocence, virtue and mystery that is imperative for the role. Hatsue goes through so many different events and emotions in her lifetime, and Kudoh handles the role with a grace and feeling all her own. She makes the audience believe in her emotional and social struggle, while also playing out Hatsue's ever-changing feelings for Ishmael as if it were on off-screen romance as well. James Cromwell, James Rebhorn, and Max von Sydow play the three major roles of the courtroom characters, and they add their own spark of intensity to the trial proceedings right where each is needed. Rebhorn must also be commended for his ability to act like a complete jerk in court, while making the audience believe that his actions are solely in the name of defending the law. Sydow is, as always, a comic relief, his wit and humor jumping in to give us a laugh or two between the testimonies of various witnesses.The book on which this film is based is truly inspired, opulent and hypnotic in every aspect of it conveyance of the story it so wonderfully tells. The movie captures that same opulence and inspiration, but goes deeper in emotional depth and involvement. Through Hicks' imagery and Howard's musical score, we are taken on a breathtaking journey into the heart of a small town where a love that once lay in the forest is brought back to life too late to be reconciled, but will remain in the hearts of characters and the audience forever.",5,Touching and very empowering!,980208000,"01 23, 2001",2001,6826,"['something', 'magical', 'dreamy', 'landscapes',

Although not the most well-written, it featured an interesting setting and good plot though the character development was weak.  Still, one cared about the characters and what happened to them.The film is instead almost incomprehensible, whether visually, plotwise or with regard to the characters.  For the privilege of a few beautiful landscape scenes you have to watch a two hour movie that seems not to have considered the absence of internal logic as a flaw in a plot-heavy film.  This film tries so hard to be arty, it forgets to have a core.Though the original book featured flashbacks and flashforwards one didn't have to read it in the dark.  But the film is shot with a minimum of light, totally chopped up in pieces that add nothing to the mood or the context, and someone who hasn't read the book will wander mindlessly through pretty landscapes missing the entire point of the book--which is about the human tendency to allow prejudice and stereotypes define our relationships with those different from ourselves.

Playwright and actor Sam Shephard, the father of less-than-war-hero Ishmael Chambers (played by Ethan Hawke), is the noble newspaper man who resists Japanese race-baiting in the wake of Pearl Harbor.Max Von Sydow is perfect as a, well, brilliant defense attorney nearing death; on his last legs, he says irreverent things a younger lawyer wouldn't, and even the judge has to pay attention. The acting is uniformly excellent, down to the falling of tears which parallels the same graceful trajectory as the snow. Indeed, given the constraints of the marketplace, and what it sets out to do, this is a perfect film.  It combines the tried and true (for example, flashing back from a courtroom case to reveal the plot), with the new (using the murder mystery itself as a hook to explore the recent history of race relations). The forbidden love affair between the American boy and the Japanese girl makes this work also a kind of tragic romance on the model of Romeo and Juliet, but with prodigious race relations rather than more local familial feuds providing the barrier. In the end the film is more literary than knock-down bang-'em-up, more about race and time and rebellious puppy love than murder or storybook romance. But in my mind that's a good thing. And despite the slow-sounding title, I doubt many will be bored.",5,"Romance, Murder, and Post-Pearl Harbor Race Relations",1046649600,"03 3, 2003",2003,1645,"['serene', 'backdrop', 'snow', 'metaphor', 'recovering', 'purity', 'innocence', 'youth', 'lightly', 'falling', 'majestic', 'cedars', 'work', 'awesome', 'example', 'cross-genre', 'writing', 'presented', 'murder', 'mystery', 'deeper', 'tale', 'nobility', 'love', 'resisting', 'hypocritical', 'racial', 'peer', 'pressures', 'Playwright', 'actor', 'Sam', 'Shephard', 'father', 'less-than-war-hero', 'Ishmael', 'Chambers', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'noble', 'newspaper', 'man', 'who', 'Japanese', 'race-baiting', 'wake', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'perfect', 'well', 'brilliant', 'defense', 'attorney', 'nearing', 'death', 'last', 'legs', 'irreverent', 'things', 'younger', 'lawyer', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'judge', 'pay', 'attention', 'acting', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'down', 'falling', 'tears', 'parallels', 'same', 'graceful', 'trajectory', 'snow', 'Indeed', 'given', 'constraints', 'marketplace', 'what', 'out', 'do', 'perfect', 'film', 'tried', 'true', 'example', 'flashing', 'back', 'courtroom', 'case', 'reveal', 'plot', 'new', 'using', 'murder', 'mystery', 'hook', 'explore', 'recent', 'history', 'race', 'relations', 'forbidden', 'love', 'affair', 'American', 'boy', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'work', 'also', 'kind', 'tragic', 'romance', 'model', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'prodigious', 'race', 'relations', 'rather', 'more', 'local', 'familial', 'feuds', 'providing', 'barrier', 'end', 'film', 'more', 'literary', 'knock-down', ""bang-'em-up"", 'more', 'race', 'time', 'rebellious', 'puppy', 'love', 'murder', 'storybook', 'romance', 'mind', 'good', 'thing', 'slow-sounding', 'title', 'doubt', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'bored']",N/A

The film drove the viewer to expect something dramatic and telling to happen, but it doesn't. The film is overly long, slow-moving and offers no real surprises. I did not read the book upon which this is based, so I was not sure what the plot was. I suspect the book was a lot better than the film. The story surrounds a town's bitterness toward the Japanese following World War II and one man's feelings for a Japanese girl. Ethan Hawke is subdued but good in his role as the one man who can prove the innocence of the Japanese girl's husband in a court case but also the one man who has the most to lose personally by doing so. Hawke's character, as a boy in the Pacific Northwest, meets the Japanese girl. They  become the best of friends and eventually they share a kiss together. It is never clear if their relationship went beyond this point, but it is safe to say that Hawke's character loved the girl. However, all the Japanese families were being shipped off to internment camps, and he and the girl were no longer able to see one another. While in the camps, the girl met a Japanese-American man (who served in the war also) and married him. Hawke also served in the war and loses an arm in battle. Hawke's father (played by Sam Shepard) is a free-thinking newspaper publisher, and he is one of the few who uses his voice and paper to criticise the policy of interning the Japanese. Soon, advertisers are pulling their support of his paper, and he is left to try to print the paper alone. Hawke becomes a journalist because of his father. Ultimately the values his father taught him about standing up for what is right and decent are what leads Hawke to gather the evidence needed to keep the Japanese girl's husband from being convicted of a murder for which he was being framed. In the end, Hawke's heart is still broken, but he has done the right thing.",2,STRIVING FOR WHAT IS RIGHT,982800000,"02 22, 2001",2001,2011,"['expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'film', 'was', 'visually', 'stunning', 'had', 'many', 'lovely', 'actors', 'felt', 'deflated', 'disappointed', 'film', 'drove', 'viewer', 'expect', 'something', 'dramatic', 'telling', 'happen', ""n't"", 'film', 'overly', 'long', 'slow-moving', 'real', 'surprises', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'based', 'was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'plot', 'was', 'suspect', 'book', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'film', 'story', 'town', 'bitterness', 'Japanese', 'following', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'one', 'man', 'feelings', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'subdued', 'good', 'role', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'prove', 'innocence', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'husband', 'court', 'case', 'also', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'most', 'lose', 'personally', 'doing', 'so', 'Hawke', 'character', 'boy', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'become', 'best', 'friends', 'eventually', 'share', 'kiss', 'together', 'never', 'clear', 'relationship', 'went', 'point', 'safe', 'say', 'Hawke', 'character', 'loved', 'girl', 'However', 'Japanese', 'families', 'were', 'being', 'shipped', 'internment', 'camps', 'girl', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'able', 'see', 'one', 'camps', 'girl', 'met', 'Japanese-American', 'man', 'who', 'served', 'war', 'also', 'married', 'Hawke', 'also', 'served', 'war', 'arm', 'battle', 'Hawke', 'father', 'played', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'free-thinking', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'voice', 'paper', 'criticise', 'policy', 'interning', 'Japanese', 'Soon', 'advertisers', 'are', 'pulling', 'support', 'paper', 'left', 'try', 'print', 'paper', 'alone', 'Hawke', 'journalist', 'father', 'Ultimately', 'values', 'father', 'taught', 'standing', 'up', 'what', 'right', 'decent', 'are', 'what', 'Hawke', 'gather', 'evidence', 'needed', 'keep', 'Japanese', 'girl', 'husband', 'being', 'convicted', 'murder', 'was', 'being', 'framed', 'end', 'Hawke', 'heart', 'still', 'broken', 'done', 'right', 'thing']",N/A

68832,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0783240325,"""flickjunkie""","[18, 20]","This is a magnificent adaptation of David Guterson's acclaimed book.  Director Scott Hicks took on a gargantuan task in attempting to make the book into a film, not only because it was so powerful and well received,  but because it was so lengthy and daedal.  The result, however, was one of  the best films I have seen in quite some time.There were really three  stories intricately interwoven into one.  The main story was the trial of a  Japanese American for the murder of a fisherman who owned the land  wrongfully taken from the accused's father.  The other two stories provide  insight into critical events affecting the trial.  The first involves the  childhood love affair of local newspaperman Ishmael (Ethan Hawke) and  Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), who is now the wife of the accused.  He has uncovered  information that can aid the defense, but his resentment for having been  jilted by Hatsue stands in the way of his bringing it forth.The second  ancillary story is the persecution of Japanese Americans and Japanese  immigrants during World War II.  We see depictions of hatred and bigotry,  as law abiding Japanese citizens are shamelessly herded into internment  camps.  This seething animus serves as the psychological backdrop for the  trial, which occurs in the early 1950's when the memories of the war and  lost loved ones is still fresh.From a directorial and cinematography  perspective, this film was nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is a  cinematic work of art.  Between Hicks' brilliant camera perspectives and  Robert Richardson's beautiful lighting and earth tone coloring, the film  was resplendent in powerful and stirring images.  Many were so artistically  done that if made into snapshots they could easily hang in any art gallery.  Each shot was meticulously thought out.  Many involved complex shots  through windows, silhouette backlighting, elaborate blocking, and scenes  where actors, props and camera were all moving in different directions to  create fabulously fluid perspective shots that slowly unfolded to revealed  the scene's full content.The editing was also fantastic.  I have seen  comparison's between this editing and `The Limey'.  While there is some  similarity in technique, this was far more elegant and flowing, whereas  ""The Limey"" was jumpy and disconnected.  This style of editing was  absolutely necessary to adhere to the book's non linear format.  Hicks  needed to insert scenes that explained the feelings and motivations of the  characters, and the only way to do this was with flashbacks and jump cuts.  Despite the fact that such editing is disconcerting to a large majority of  viewers, it was an artistic decision that was exactly right for the story,  and seamlessly done.  The same is true of the audio overlays with  monologues of characters superimposed on one another, giving great power  and emphasis to certain of the characters' lines.The story itself, with  all of its components, was engaging and well crafted.  Unfortunately, there  was not enough time to develop more of the characters.  The scenes  depicting the herding of the Japanese out of their homes for relocation  were chilling.  The courtroom scenes were realistic, not forsaking court  procedure for dramatic effect, as is so common nowadays.  The love scenes  were sensitive, romantic and passionate without the need for sexual  explicitness.From an acting perspective, this was more of an ensemble  production.  All the actors gave wonderful performances, especially Youki  Kudoh, who was torn between her love for Ishmael and her loyalty to her  family and traditions.  Kudoh was so emotionally involved with the part  that she actually began crying during the featurette when recalling one of  the scenes.  Screen legend Max von Sydow was also fantastic as the aging  defense attorney fighting and pleading for justice amidst the racial  hatred.This is a beautifully crafted film with a compelling story.

Well that's what this movie does to other films. This is a film desperately  in love with being alive. Every camera shot, every sound effect, every  close-up seems to give the viewer a new perspective, a new take on life.  For me it's one of those life-changing things.The story is somewhat  heavy-handed in parts: the director never really gives you a realistic  Japanese perspective on the horror of being ripped from their homes &amp;  being sent to relocation camps (and, frankly, given that 40 million people  died in WWII &amp; tens of millions more lost everything they owned, it  seems almost miniscule). And while the prosecution's closing argument  basically amounts to 'convict him because he's Japanese', the defense's  closing argument seems equally inept: 'acquit him because he's  Japanese.'But these are minor issues indeed. The story moves past these  quickly and makes a far better argument against prejudice in the  protagonist's personal story.

The movie centers around the trial of a young  Japanese man who is accused of killing an American fisherman over a land  dispute right after WWII.  The accused was a war hero (on the American  side) but lingering mistrust of the Japanese threatens the objectivity of  the trial.  The man's wife was the childhood friend and lover of a local  newspaperman.  Their romance was kept secret because it was forbidden by  both families and by society.  The newspaperman watches this trial with a  moral dilemma because he is bitter about his breakup with the Japanese  girl, yet he posseses information which might exonerate her husband.  This  story is told with the beautiful background of the Pacific Northwest. The  performances were excellent, even the more minor characters such as the  defense attorney at the trial. These positives are seriously marred by the  frequent flashbacks which distract from the flow of the story and are  confusing to the viewer.

Her husband is now on trial for murder and Ishmael is the town newspaperman. As we learn in endless moody flashbacks during the trial, the two were teenage lovers until she was shipped to a relocation camp and he went to fight in Europe. She was forced to break their engagement, and he nearly lost the will to live, after being gravely wounded on D-Day. Now, with the townsfolk full of anti-Japanese prejudice, it looks hopeless for Hatsue's husband.The wonderful Max Von Sydow shows off his acting chops as the husband's sympathetic attorney. He is the only reason you care anything about the trial.  Sam Shepherd, as Ishmael's father, is also wonderful. Kudoh is very good, displaying a wide range of emotions, but star Hawke is the weakest link in the film. He is wooden and bland, and never arouses any feelings of empathy.The first 45 minutes were filled with tediously boring introductory scenes and flashbacks.  The basic story is would have made a good 90-minute movie of the week, but at 2 hours and 8 minutes it, only made me restless. Yes, the wintery island scenery is beautiful and young love is sweet.

68848,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0783240325,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[6, 7]","Once upon a time, before the attack on Pearl Harbor to be specific, young Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), the son of editor (Sam Shepard) of the local newspaper in a small town in the Pacific Northwest fell in love with Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), the daughter of a Japanese American family.  Put then Pearl Harbor happens and despite editorials reminding everybody what it means to be an American, all of the Japanese in the area have their property confiscated and are bussed off to the Manzanar concentration camp (that was the term used back them).  The twist of fate in &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars,&quot; the 1999 film based on the novel by David Guterson, is that in 1951 Ishmael is running his father's newspaper and finds himself covering a murder trial in which the accused is Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), the man Hatsue married in the camp.&quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; is a film that combines a love triangle with a murder trial, but the character who is really on the spot is Ishmael.  The trial has to do with the death of a fisherman, whose corpse turns up in the nets of another boat.  The deceased had just bought the property that Kazuo's family had been planning to buy but the war and prejudice combined to deny them the property.  The prosecutor (James Rebhorn) sees clear motive and Kazuo provides the opportunity.  Most importantly, Kazuo is Japanese, and even if he fought for the U.S. Army in the war that is not enough to outweigh his race with the locals, even if the judge (James Cromwell) is clearly disgusted by the implications and Kazuo's attorney is the local sage and voice of reason (Max Von Sydow).  But for Ishmael the trial is more personal and you know he is thinking that if Kazuo is convicted that he might have another chance with Hatsue.  Besides, the evidence looks compelling, at least until Hatsue takes the stand and defends her husband.The over racism of the people of this small town both during and after the war is quite disturbing, even though director Scott Hicks does not overplay his hand.  Hicks attempts some ambitious ways of telling this story, where he uses a variety of visual styles to convey the different perspectives and realities.  The effect is somewhat reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Rashomon,&quot; intentionally so to my mind, since both films deal with how we each have our own perspectives on reality.  The result is that we become convinced of Kazuo's innocence and wonder when Ishmael will not only come to the same conclusion but act upon it, for it is clear he is the pivotal figure in the tale.The title of this film has a definite sense of the poetic, and Hicks does a nice job of capturing both the poetic and the sense of a real community that was divided long before the war started (when the Japanese Americans are relocated we see one side of the school bus is empty, because they always sat on one side of the bus).  Ishmael had proposed to Hatsue and the way the war altered their lives is obvious, as is the great injustice of it all, so Ishmael can hardly be faulted for wanting things back the way they almost were.Ultimately, I appreciate the great irony that the true American in the story is Nels Gudmundsson, the lawyer played by Max Von Sydow.  His character immigrated to the United States and when he defends Kazuo there is a constant current of rage and anger in every thing he says and does in court because the people of this town are rejecting all of the values and principles that made him come to this country.  When he tells Ishmael &quot;It takes a rare thing, a turning point, to free oneself from any obsession, be it prejudice or hate, or, even love,&quot; we know that we have heard the moral of the story and that Ishmael will finally be moved to action.My only problem with &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot; is, I think, clearly my own problem.  My outrage over the treatment of the Japanese was such that the love of Ishmael and Hatsue, and even the trial of Kazou seem so trivial in comparison.  Even a verdict of innocence is the proverbial example of too little too late.  Then ago, part of the point here is that neither these characters nor the country deserve to be left off the hook for what it did to its own citizens.",4,The rare thing of freeing yourself from an obsession,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,4242,"['Once', 'time', 'attack', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'be', 'specific', 'young', 'Ishmael', 'Chambers', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'son', 'editor', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'local', 'newspaper', 'small', 'town', 'Pacific', 'Northwest', 'fell', 'love', 'Hatsue', 'Youki', 'Kudoh', 'daughter', 'Japanese', 'American', 'family', 'Put', 'then', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'editorials', 'reminding', 'everybody', 'what', 'be', 'American', 'Japanese', 'area', 'have', 'property', 'confiscated', 'are', 'bussed', 'Manzanar', 'concentration', 'camp', 'was', 'term', 'used', 'back', 'twist', 'fate', 'quot', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'quot', '1999', 'film', 'based', 'novel', 'David', 'Guterson', '1951', 'Ishmael', 'running', 'father', 'newspaper', 'covering', 'murder', 'trial', 'accused', 'Kazuo', 'Miyamoto', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'man', 'Hatsue', 'married', 'camp.', 'quot', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'quot', 'film', 'love', 'triangle', 'murder', 'trial', 'character', 'who', 'really', 'spot', 'Ishmael', 'trial', 'do', 'death', 'fisherman', 'corpse', 'up', 'nets', 'boat', 'deceased', 'had', 'just', 'bought', 'property', 'Kazuo', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'planning', 'buy', 'war', 'prejudice', 'combined', 'deny', 'property', 'prosecutor', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'clear', 'motive', 'Kazuo', 'opportunity', 'Most', 'importantly', 'Kazuo', 'Japanese', 'even', 'fought', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'war', 'not', 'enough', 'outweigh', 'race', 'locals', 'even', 'judge', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'clearly', 'disgusted', 'implications', 'Kazuo', 'attorney', 'local', 'sage', 'voice', 'reason', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'Ishmael', 'trial', 'more', 'personal', 'know', 'thinking', 'Kazuo', 'convicted', 'might', 'have', 'chance', 'Hatsue', 'Besides', 'evidence', 'compelling', 'least', 'Hatsue', 'stand', 'husband.The', 'racism', 'people', 'small', 'town', 'war', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'even', 'director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'not', 'overplay', 'hand', 'Hicks', 'ambitious', 'ways', 'telling', 'story', 'where', 'variety', 'visual', 'styles', 'convey', 'different', 'perspectives', 'realities', 'effect', 'somewhat', 'reminiscent', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'quot', 'Rashomon', 'quot', 'intentionally', 'mind', 'films', 'deal', 'how', 'have', 'own', 'perspectives', 'reality', 'result', 'become', 'convinced', 'Kazuo', 'innocence', 'wonder', 'when', 'Ishmael', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'come', 'same', 'conclusion', 'act', 'clear', 'pivotal', 'figure', 'tale.The', 'title', 'film', 'definite', 'sense', 'poetic', 'Hicks', 'nice', 'job', 'capturing', 'poetic', 'sense', 'real', 'community', 'was', 'divided', 'long', 'war', 'started', 'when', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'are', 'relocated', 'see', 'one', 'side', 'school', 'bus', 'empty', 'always', 'sat', 'one', 'side', 'bus', 'Ishmael', 'had', 'proposed', 'Hatsue', 'way', 'war', 'altered', 'lives', 'obvious', 'great', 'injustice', 'Ishmael', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'faulted', 'wanting', 'things', 'back', 'way', 'almost', 'were.Ultimately', 'appreciate', 'great', 'irony', 'true', 'American', 'story', 'Nels', 'Gudmundsson', 'lawyer', 'played', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'character', 'immigrated', 'United', 'States', 'when', 'Kazuo', 'constant', 'current', 'rage', 'anger', 'thing', 'court', 'people', 'town', 'are', 'rejecting', 'values', 'principles', 'made', 'come', 'country', 'When', 'Ishmael', 'quot', 'rare', 'thing', 'turning', 'point', 'free', 'obsession', 'be', 'prejudice', 'hate', 'even', 'love', 'quot', 'know', 'have', 'heard', 'moral', 'story', 'Ishmael', 'will', 'finally', 'be', 'moved', 'action.My', 'only', 'problem', 'quot', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'quot', 'think', 'clearly', 'own', 'problem', 'outrage', 'treatment', 'Japanese', 'was', 'such', 'love', 'Ishmael', 'Hatsue', 'even', 'trial', 'Kazou', 'seem', 'so', 'trivial', 'comparison', 'Even', 'verdict', 'innocence', 'proverbial', 'example', 'too', 'little', 'too', 'late', 'Then', 'ago', 'part', 'point', 'here', 'neither', 'characters', 'country', 'deserve', 'be', 'left', 'off', 'hook', 'what', 'did', 'own', 'citizens']",N/A

Ethan Hawke is good as the conflicted Ishmael Chambers suffering from a wartime accident that left him with one arm, adjusting to life without his father, and carrying a torch for the Japanese girl who was his first love.  Ultimately, this is a tale of sacrifice and true love.  Sam Shepard as the father is wonderfully studious, a man of letters.  Rick Yune as the Japanese man accused of murder is affecting and shows star quality in this performance.  His wife, played by Yuki Kudoh, is also beautiful; her performance is touching.  Max Von Sydow's final courtroom summation is one of the finest cinematic monologues you'll see.  Director Scott Hicks who was making his first picture since the award-winning Shine did a great job with this lyrical tale.  The DVD version doesn't offer a lot more, IMHO.

He discovers facts about the incident, and must also relive his memories.Directed by Scott Hicks, the film is cinematographically beautiful, capturing the trees and the snow and the fog with a variety of film techniques.

I was 20  by the time I even heard of the holocaust..and a few years older than that whe I first heard about the internment of Japanese Americans after Pearl Harbor.This film tells that story as it unfolded in a small fishing village in the San Juan Islands..through  flashback in connection with the trial of a young Japanese American fisherman for the murder of a fellow non asian fisherman in the fleet.  It includes the classic ""Romeo  Juliet"" story of a youthful love affair between the defendants wife and a local reporter following the trial.I have always wanted to know more about the internment of Japanese Americans..not just what happened but how it happened, how it emerged from American culture..how Americans could have done that to other Americans. And this film answers my hearts questions so beautifully, so simply, so compassionately giving us room to form our own understandings of what happened and how  it happened in very human terms, in the terms of ordinary life in a small village.As with many stories told with flashback it is not a clear simple unfolding  but then again the culture, traditions and humanity  that combine to create this kind of narrative are not themselves a simple unfolding.  The film, in my opinion, does a wonderful job of helping us to understand the subtleties of racism..perhaps even to see a little more clearly the biases within us to which we are blind and which we carry unknowingly into the world.My five stars are not so much for the cinematic art of the film ( it's direction, screen play, acting, cinematography etc.) but for the grace and simple openness with which it tells this story  tgat is so important for all of us to visit historically..and within ourselves now.",5,The Architecture of Racism,1299974400,"03 13, 2011",2011,2000,"['grew', 'up', 'Maine', 'where', 'everyone', 'pride', 'having', 'clean', 'hands', 'racism', 'slavery', 'other', 'unfortunate', 'regional', 'problems', 'even', 'almost', 'household', 'most', 'likely', 'still', 'least', 'one', 'book', 'very', 'popular', 'eugenics', 'movement', '20', '30', 'was', '20', 'time', 'even', 'heard', 'holocaust..and', 'few', 'years', 'older', 'whe', 'first', 'heard', 'internment', 'Japanese', 'Americans', 'Pearl', 'Harbor.This', 'film', 'tells', 'story', 'unfolded', 'small', 'fishing', 'village', 'San', 'Juan', 'Islands..through', 'flashback', 'connection', 'trial', 'young', 'Japanese', 'American', 'fisherman', 'murder', 'fellow', 'non', 'asian', 'fisherman', 'fleet', 'classic', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'story', 'youthful', 'love', 'affair', 'defendants', 'wife', 'local', 'reporter', 'following', 'trial.I', 'have', 'always', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'internment', 'Japanese', 'Americans..not', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'happened', 'how', 'emerged', 'American', 'culture..how', 'Americans', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'other', 'Americans', 'film', 'answers', 'hearts', 'questions', 'so', 'beautifully', 'so', 'simply', 'so', 'compassionately', 'giving', 'room', 'form', 'own', 'understandings', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'happened', 'very', 'human', 'terms', 'terms', 'ordinary', 'life', 'small', 'village.As', 'many', 'stories', 'told', 'flashback', 'not', 'clear', 'simple', 'unfolding', 'then', 'again', 'culture', 'traditions', 'humanity', 'combine', 'create', 'kind', 'narrative', 'are', 'not', 'simple', 'unfolding', 'film', 'opinion', 'wonderful', 'job', 'helping', 'understand', 'subtleties', 'racism..perhaps', 'even', 'see', 'little', 'more', 'clearly', 'biases', 'are', 'blind', 'carry', 'unknowingly', 'world.My', 'five', 'stars', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'cinematic', 'art', 'film', 'direction', 'screen', 'play', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'etc', 'grace', 'simple', 'openness', 'story', 'tgat', 'so', 'important', 'visit', 'historically..and', 'ourselves', 'now']",N/A

Writing is like most other tasks or crafts. Sometimes, you look at the job at hand and jump right in, knowing exactly where you are going. Other times, you don't know where to begin. So, let me begin with the easiest part - the story.Ishmael Chambers [Ethan Hawke] is a handsome man in his late 20s who runs the small town newspaper formerly published by his late father. The place is on a small island off the coast of Washington State. The main industries are fishing and growing strawberries.One night a fisherman is found dead in the water not far from his boat. At first it appears to be an accident, but soon the suspicion of murder arises. You might think this to be the only major event to happen to the islanders in years, but you would be wrong. The year is 1948, the young men have returned from fighting in W.W.II, and the large local Japanese-American population has returned from a California concentration camp where they were kept for the duration of the war. It is a seldom mentioned fact that almost every American of Japanese descent was imprisoned during that time. It remains one of the saddest chapters in American history.When a young Japanese-American fisherman is accused of the crime, Ishmael has a major story to cover. It is not a happy event for him. The possibility of an unprejudiced trial seems unlikely, considering the bitter feelings that remain everywhere. Harder for him yet, the accused's wife is Hatsue [Youki Kudoh], who is the only woman Ishmael has ever loved. They kept their love a secret from their families, neither of which would have approved, from the time they were 13 or 14 years old. Racial prejudice was hard enough for the couple to bear, but it was the war that destroyed their affair. Suddenly, Ishmael has a ray of hope. What if the husband is found guilty? And yet, isn't there evidence to prove he is innocent?Director Scott Hicks has proved that he can be excellent. He directed Shine, for example. Here, he is teamed with cinemaphotographer Robert Richardson. Together they have produced one of the most visually artistic movies ever made. It is like looking at a series of painting by the masters. Yet it is though they became bewitch by their own creativity. As a result, Snow Falling on Cedars is an intellectual work. The problem occurs when this approach meets the story. Its plot, which begs for a really emotional telling, is overshadowed by perfectionism - the perfect lighting, the perfect framing, the perfect background, etc. You can, of course, become too painstaking in an endeavor, and often this makes the results seem somewhat mannered, artificial, and, worst of all, slow. That's the result in this movie. It's exquisitely beautiful and very, very, very slow. This all brings me back to why it was so hard to write this review, for Snow Falling on Cedars is both brilliant and disappointing.",3,Flashes of brilliance permeate flawed film,1016496000,"03 19, 2002",2002,2972,"['Halfway', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'knew', 'was', 'not', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'review', 'Writing', 'most', 'other', 'tasks', 'crafts', 'Sometimes', 'look', 'job', 'hand', 'jump', 'right', 'knowing', 'exactly', 'where', 'are', 'going', 'Other', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'where', 'begin', 'So', 'let', 'begin', 'easiest', 'part', 'story.Ishmael', 'Chambers', '[', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', ']', 'handsome', 'man', 'late', '20s', 'who', 'small', 'town', 'newspaper', 'formerly', 'published', 'late', 'father', 'place', 'small', 'island', 'coast', 'Washington', 'State', 'main', 'industries', 'are', 'fishing', 'growing', 'strawberries.One', 'night', 'fisherman', 'found', 'dead', 'water', 'not', 'far', 'boat', 'first', 'be', 'accident', 'soon', 'suspicion', 'murder', 'arises', 'might', 'think', 'be', 'only', 'major', 'event', 'happen', 'islanders', 'years', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'year', '1948', 'young', 'men', 'have', 'returned', 'fighting', 'W.W.II', 'large', 'local', 'Japanese-American', 'population', 'returned', 'California', 'concentration', 'camp', 'where', 'were', 'kept', 'duration', 'war', 'seldom', 'mentioned', 'fact', 'almost', 'American', 'Japanese', 'descent', 'was', 'imprisoned', 'time', 'one', 'saddest', 'chapters', 'American', 'history.When', 'young', 'Japanese-American', 'fisherman', 'accused', 'crime', 'Ishmael', 'major', 'story', 'cover', 'not', 'happy', 'event', 'possibility', 'unprejudiced', 'trial', 'unlikely', 'considering', 'bitter', 'feelings', 'remain', 'everywhere', 'Harder', 'yet', 'accused', 'wife', 'Hatsue', '[', 'Youki', 'Kudoh', ']', 'who', 'only', 'woman', 'Ishmael', 'ever', 'loved', 'kept', 'love', 'secret', 'families', 'would', 'have', 'approved', 'time', 'were', '13', '14', 'years', 'old', 'Racial', 'prejudice', 'was', 'hard', 'enough', 'couple', 'bear', 'was', 'war', 'destroyed', 'affair', 'Suddenly', 'Ishmael', 'ray', 'hope', 'What', 'husband', 'found', 'guilty', 'yet', ""n't"", 'evidence', 'prove', 'innocent', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'proved', 'can', 'be', 'excellent', 'directed', 'Shine', 'example', 'Here', 'teamed', 'cinemaphotographer', 'Robert', 'Richardson', 'Together', 'have', 'produced', 'one', 'most', 'visually', 'artistic', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'looking', 'series', 'painting', 'masters', 'became', 'bewitch', 'own', 'creativity', 'result', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'intellectual', 'work', 'problem', 'when', 'approach', 'story', 'plot', 'really', 'emotional', 'telling', 'overshadowed', 'perfectionism', 'perfect', 'lighting', 'perfect', 'framing', 'perfect', 'background', 'etc', 'can', 'course', 'become', 'too', 'painstaking', 'endeavor', 'often', 'results', 'seem', 'somewhat', 'mannered', 'artificial', 'worst', 'slow', 'result', 'movie', 'exquisitely', 'beautiful', 'very', 'very', 'very', 'slow', 'back', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'brilliant', 'disappointing']",N/A

SNOW FALLING was a slow, lethargic, but overall compelling novel; the movie version is the same.  Scott Hicks' direction is frustrating yet magnificent at times.  For instance, in Max von Sydow's brilliant summation, the camera never leaves Max's face, and the sequence is overwhelming due to the power of von Sydow's speech.  It's a key highlight of the movie.  However, earlier on, Hicks tries the overdubbing of too many key scenes; for instance, when Hasue is reading her letter, he overdubs it several times, and it becomes irritating rather than moving; he tries this on other occasions and as a gimmick, it doesn't improve the overall effect.  The acting ensemble is marvelous:  Ethan Hawke, though not as compelling as he should have been, does well in displaying his anger, hurt, frustration and love; Youki Kodoh as the wife of the accused is wonderful, her spritely demeanor hiding a gigantic love for her husband and for Hawke; Rick Yune (Die Another Day) shows the difficulty in expressing emotion as was taught by his father; James Rebhorn as the prosecutor is great, one of his best roles; James Cromwell does well as the judge in a poorly adapted role; Sam Shepard is very good as Hawke's idealistic father; Celia Weston evokes the nasty prejudice of the time as the victim's coldhearted mother; Richard Jenkins is good as the sheriff caught up in something he's not used to--murder; and Eric Thal is good as the victim, should have had a little more screen time to flesh out his role, and make us feel a little more for him.SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS is a lush, beautifully done film, with an Oscar worthy von Sydow performance; it's hard to stay with it, but if you do, I think you'll be rewarded.",4,LUSH ADAPTATION OF DIFFICULT BOOK,1089936000,"07 16, 2004",2004,1836,"['One', 'can', 'not', 'deny', 'awesome', 'beauty', 'camerawork', 'adaptation', 'David', 'Guterson', 'SNOW', 'FALLING', 'ON', 'CEDARS', 'SNOW', 'FALLING', 'was', 'slow', 'lethargic', 'overall', 'compelling', 'novel', 'movie', 'version', 'same', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'direction', 'frustrating', 'yet', 'magnificent', 'times', 'instance', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'brilliant', 'summation', 'camera', 'never', 'Max', 'face', 'sequence', 'overwhelming', 'due', 'power', 'von', 'Sydow', 'speech', 'key', 'highlight', 'movie', 'However', 'earlier', 'Hicks', 'overdubbing', 'too', 'many', 'key', 'scenes', 'instance', 'when', 'Hasue', 'reading', 'letter', 'several', 'times', 'irritating', 'rather', 'moving', 'other', 'occasions', 'gimmick', ""n't"", 'improve', 'overall', 'effect', 'acting', 'ensemble', 'marvelous', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'though', 'not', 'as', 'compelling', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'displaying', 'anger', 'hurt', 'frustration', 'love', 'Youki', 'Kodoh', 'wife', 'accused', 'wonderful', 'spritely', 'demeanor', 'hiding', 'gigantic', 'love', 'husband', 'Hawke', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'Die', 'Day', 'difficulty', 'expressing', 'emotion', 'was', 'taught', 'father', 'James', 'Rebhorn', 'prosecutor', 'great', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'James', 'Cromwell', 'well', 'judge', 'poorly', 'adapted', 'role', 'Sam', 'Shepard', 'very', 'good', 'Hawke', 'idealistic', 'father', 'Celia', 'Weston', 'nasty', 'prejudice', 'time', 'victim', 'coldhearted', 'mother', 'Richard', 'Jenkins', 'good', 'sheriff', 'caught', 'up', 'something', 'not', 'used', 'murder', 'Eric', 'Thal', 'good', 'victim', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'little', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'flesh', 'out', 'role', 'make', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'him.SNOW', 'FALLING', 'ON', 'CEDARS', 'lush', 'beautifully', 'done', 'film', 'Oscar', 'worthy', 'von', 'Sydow', 'performance', 'hard', 'stay', 'do', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rewarded']",N/A

68861,A1Q0AQ2HVNSYYW,0783240325,Mr. Cairene,"[12, 16]","The real star of Snow Falling on Cedars is director Scott Hicks. Working from David Guterson's beautiful novel, and with the help of the legendary  cinematographer Robert Richardson he is able to create sequences of film of  such intense beauty that you almost forgive the fact that film doesn't  quite come togather as a whole.The story revolves around the death of  a Caucasian fisherman in a Pacific North Western town a few years after the  bombing of Pearl Harbor. An American born man of Japanese descent stands  accused of his murder. Meanwhile a local newspaper man Ishmael Chambers  (Ethan Hawke) watches from the sidelines, he has a vested interest because  the man who is accused is married to his childhood sweetheart, his only  true love Hatsue Miyamoto (Youki Kudoh). But the synopsis doesn't indicate  how complex the story is, it is told with flashbacks, and flashbacks within  flasbacks, making a mess of the film, but a beautiful and poetic mess.The performance were unfairly criticised by the critics, specifically Ethan  Hawke's. His Ishmael is a bitter, heartbroken and wounded war veteran, and  Hawke's understated performance expresses that perfectly. A man who lives  in his father's shadow, never quite living up to the Chambers name. He has  lost an arm in the war, and his bitterness towards Hatsue effects his  reporting of the case. Now cynical and jaded he says &quot;Facts you can  cling to, emotions just fly away&quot;.The best performance in the  film is Max Von Sydow's. He plays Nel Gud Mundson who is the accused's  attorney. Saddened by the community's deep prejudice, now old and crusty he  trembles with anger when he addresses the jury. Von Sydow should have been  a shoe in for the supporting actor Oscar, but alas he was ignored.This film is also more observant when dealing with rascism. You see movies  like THE HURRICANE idiotically simplify a system of thought that runs  through out a society into a character of a bad cop. Snow Falling on Cedars  is wiser, exposing the prejudice to be a deeply held belief among all  citizens of a commuinity. A prejudice that is dormant in times of piece but  all too apparent in time of war.I really wanted to love this film,  something about beautiful imagery playing under a powerful musical score  gets to me. Although I give the film 3 stars, I'm reccomending because it  is both frustrating and inspiring. A film that demands repeated veiwings,  but doesn't make that task easy. If you can appreciate dense poetic films  like THE THIN RED LINE or THE ENGLISH PATIENT, you'll appreciate this one  even if its not in the same league as those two masterpieces. I suspect  Snow Falling on Cedars is a great film, but its structure makes that  greatness hard to get to.

Some directors have done their jobs marvellously &amp; some of them lost the plot along the way.  It took the author  10 years to write this best-seller  &amp; initially, I remained dubious if the director, Scott Hicks was able  to compress the novel to almost 2 hours of viewing.  What worried me the  most was the ability of the director to convey the mood &amp; atmosphere of  the novel into the silver screen.  Or else the essence of the novel would  be lost. To be truthful, he's not only faithful to the novel but did the  job with flying colours.  The cinematography was simply superb &amp;  breathtaking.  I was enthralled throughout the viewing absorbing every  little bits that were offered to me.  The production team of Frank &amp;  Marshall who had worked with Ethan Hawke before in Alive delivered yet  another slick production.  Scott Hicks deserved to be commended for a job  well-done after his previous offering of The Shining, &amp; the veteran,  Max Von Sydow delivered a punchy performance as the defendant's lawyer.  My  girl friend, who hadn't read the novel before, found the movie rather  abstract &amp; at times, she couldn't grasp the story in totality  particularly in how the film shots were shown.  She reckoned that the story  line itself was too simplistic &amp; had been dragged on FAR too long.  Just to prove my point, she slept half way through the movie.

Schmidt,"[1, 1]","""Snow Falling On Cedars"" takes place on a remote island off the coast of America in the Pacific northwest, and the time is shortly after the end of WWII. The community on the island is comprised of long time residents as well as more recent arrivals, including both European and Japanese immigrants. In flashbacks, events during the war are revealed, including the battlefield service of two young men, one Caucasian and one of Japanese descent, and the forced internment of Japanese families during the conflict. As the story opens, there is bitterness over an aborted land deal between two immigrant families from Europe and Japan, and a murder has apparently taken place involving the sons of those families. Anger towards the Japanese immigrants is felt by many in the community. Mixed with this is the romance between a young Japanese woman and the local newspaper editor, who was badly wounded during the war while fighting the Japanese. All of the tension boils down to a courtroom drama as the participants try to figure out what really happened. The photography is moody and often features lots of gray, rainy or snowy days.

68869,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0783240325,Reviewer,"[5, 8]","Honor and justice, the effects of prejudice, and most importantly the need for truth; all elements that bind us together as a community of Man, or threaten to tear us apart, depending upon the circumstances at hand, and how we, as a society approach them.  What it all comes down to is having and living by a moral code, and applying that code objectively, especially in troubled times.  And the real question is, when the time comes, are we as a people capable of achieving that objectivity that is imperative in assuring true justice for all?  It's an important, legitimate question posed by director Scott Hicks in ""Snow Falling On Cedars,"" a very real and personal drama, that in the final analysis has a bearing of monumental proportions that ultimately defines who we are and what we are made of, while ascertaining whether or not we do, indeed, have the moral courage necessary to survive as a civilized species.It's a small town in the State of Washington; the ninth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor is coming up, and a young man named Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune), a much decorated American soldier during the war, is on trial for the murder of local fisherman Carl Heine (Eric Thal).  Covering the trial is reporter Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke), whose father, Arthur (Sam Shepard), had been a respected newspaperman locally for many years, known as a man who was not afraid to speak from his conscience when writing an editorial, and who took a stand for the Japanese locals during the emotionally exasperating years encompassing World War II.Attempting to objectively cover Kazuo's trial, Ishmael finds himself troubled by a conflict of interests; he has a history with Kazuo's wife, Hatsue (Youki Kudoh), a former relationship reaching back to their childhood, but which ended with the onset of the war.  And Ishmael still is grappling with the bitterness he has felt since that time, born of his experiences in the military, as well as Hatsue's rejection of him.  And now he is forced to objectively observe this pivotal point in her life, watching from the sidelines and seeing first hand the effects of the prejudice that is very much alive among the local citizenry, and which threatens the assurance of an impartial judgment in Kazuo's case; a judgment that will determine the future of not only Kazuo, but of Hatsue, the woman Ishmael once loved-- and still does.Working from an intelligent screenplay (by Hicks and Ronald Bass, adapted from the novel by David Guterson), with this film Hicks demonstrates the difference between a visionary filmmaker and someone who just makes movies.  In another's hands, because of the story itself, this would have no doubt been an excellent film; with Hicks directing, however, it becomes something much more, as he has taken it beyond excellent, crafting and delivering a film that is thoroughly mesmerizing, majestic and memorable.  It's an accomplishment achieved through a visionary presentation, born of the director's sensitive approach to the material and his acute insights into the human condition.  Fully utilizing all of the magic at his disposal, Hicks has taken a good film and turned it into an emotionally involving, inspirational and visually poetic experience.With a haunting score by James Newton Howard underscoring the magnificent cinematography of Robert Richardson, Hicks brings the era and the rural splendor of Washington State vividly to life, creating an aesthetic ambiance that makes the emotional essence of the drama almost tangible; and by exacting some incredible performances from his actors, he sustains that emotional level and combines all of these elements to make this film riveting and unforgettable.As Ishmael, Ethan Hawke gives a reserved, understated performance, through which he genuinely captures the essence of his character.  Watching him, you can sense the turmoil of a soul at cross purposes with itself, and he enables you to sample that taste of bitterness toward life he so desperately needs to overcome if he is to move on within himself to greener pastures.  With this role, Hawke was given the opportunity to do something fine, and he succeeds with one of his most memorable performances yet.Youki Kudoh turns in an extremely affecting performance, as well, as Hatsue.  With this moving portrayal of a young woman enduring unbearable inner turmoil, she fulfills the artistic promises made in previous films, such as ""Mystery Train"" in `89, and ""Picture Bride,"" in 1965.  She's a terrific actor, whose eyes are truly a window to her soul.Also adding to the success of this film are the supporting efforts of Richard Jenkins, as Sheriff Moran, and James Rebhorn as prosecutor Alvin Hooks.  But the most notable performance of all comes from Max von Sydow, who as Kazuo's defense attorney, Nels Gudmundsson, is given an opportunity to return to the kind of role that shaped his career early on under the auspices of Ingmar Bergman.  As Nels, von Sydow gives a performance made all the more powerful by the restraint and subtlety of his delivery.  He takes what to most actors would be a good part, and makes it a cohesive element of the film.  It's a performance that by all rights should have earned von Sydow an Oscar nomination, but sadly did not.The supporting cast includes Reeve Carney (Young Ishmael), Ann Suzuki (Young Hatsue), James Cromwell (Judge Fielding), Ariia Bareikis (Susan Marie), Celia Weston (Etta) and Daniel von Bargen (Carl).  In a year (1999) that saw lesser efforts acknowledged, ""Snow Falling On Cedars"" was inexplicably ignored at Oscar time (except for Richardson's most deserving nomination for cinematography); an injustice, to say the least, as this was clearly one of the best films of the year.  Reminiscent of Ang Lee's artistry, yet with a style uniquely his own, Hicks has given us a poetic film of rare beauty and conscience, for which he is hereby granted an Award in it's purest form:  The gratitude of an appreciate audience.",5,Inexplicably Ignored at the Oscars,1025740800,"07 4, 2002",2002,5981,"['Honor', 'justice', 'effects', 'prejudice', 'most', 'importantly', 'need', 'truth',

Williams ""just an avid reader""","[4, 4]","The movie is about ghosts.First, the ghost of the dead fisherman and the trial of the Japanese-American accused of his murder.Second, the ghost of a long ago childhood forbidden love affair between the small town newspaper editor/publisher's son and the now-wife of the accused.Third, the ghost of Pearl Harbour, WWII and the racial prejudice that resulted in the concentration camps for Japanese Americans.The three ghosts are completely twisted together, the newspaper editor can't move on from his childhood love, the community can not rise above the racial profiling it engages it.It's a depressing, period piece, sad with the quiet street full of Japanese-Americans, now war hysteria internees walking down the small town's mail street to be ferried to Manzanar for the duration of WWII. The movie is at least 75% flashbacks, it is very non-linear, very literary, not your usual movie fare. There are two heroes, the defense lawyer and the small town publisher, but they are completely overwhelmed by the masses of people demanding that something be done. But the story is not about them, it is about the two main characters, moving on and letting go of their old ghosts.This movie, like movies such as Farewell to Manzanar, are necessary to dispose of our society's old ghosts. Showing them in the light of what happened, and hopefully why it happened, in order that it won't happen again. Ghosts don't seem to die if you just ignore them, bury them away and try to forget. Just as he has to forget his childhood love, understand that she is married and has a life of her own without him, the island people have to come to grips with the fact that they transported their friends and neighbors to camps in the hysteria of the moment.

68872,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,0783240325,Robert Blake,"[8, 9]","""Snow Falling On Cedars"" is a beautifully composed film about obsession, heartbreak and history. Director Scott Hicks delivers a film of enormous scope and beauty with memorable characters and a plot that is intricate and unweaves itself as the movie pushes forward. Those here who have bashed the movie apparently have no love for cinema or grandiose images. If you don't like art, don't see this film. Hicks excels here in the way the images don't interrupt the narrative, instead they flow with it. Cinematographer Robert Richardson paints here with lush colors, using the myst and snow to create emotion and lets the image bring out the moods of the characters, of the story. The editing can create a visceral experience enhanced by the epic, almost operatic score by James Newton Howard. Single images stick in the mind. The screenplay by Hicks and Ron Bass is eloquent and reaches out to the farthest reaches of classic romanticism, there are moments of pure emotion, sometimes brought about by images and sometimes just by words. ""Snow Falling On Cedars"" has the kind of classic storytelling missing in a lot of modern romances. It seems to me a lot of the critics here would probably prefer oversexed dribble instead of something with real heart. The performances are superb all around and the production design of the film is flawless. This is a lush tapestry of a love story, framed by wonderous cinematography.

I love exploring and considering what decisions a fine Director chooses in making a film, though I'm certain I don't understand every aspect of the process.I must confess I've had to watch `Snow Falling On Cedars' several times to really appreciate the interpretation and artistic qualities Director Scott Hicks incorporated. I had read the book several years ago and had forgotten a lot of the detail, so this film was challenging for me at first.Lots of movies that I enjoy are not so difficult to view. They are often well produced and directed, though not necessarily. Many incorporate the best and most interesting actors, but not always. The movies that interest me can be quite entertaining and easy to watch the first screening, with a very select few ending up in my collection at some point. But `Snow Falling on Cedars' hardly fits this ""easy to watch"" category; it is truly more of an Art Film.I re-introduced myself to `Snow Falling on Cedars' as film after reviewing the Soundtrack. I'm a Music Teacher by trade and avocation and came across it when sorting out some CDs at school. Watching it again required focus and concentration on my part and my initial reaction was ""This is maybe a two or three-star film -- OK, but not really outstanding.""It was either Siskel or Ebert - I dis-remember which - who made a comment to the effect that we of this generation seem to lack patience in letting a particular film develop, in letting its storyline and intricacies and details be revealed to us gradually, and often subtly. This may be part of the `instant gratification' that has been incorporated into our collective, post-modern personas; at least this seems true for me.I will suggest that `Snow Falling on Cedars' is well worth your time. It may be helpful to read the book (again) though I haven't yet. It may be helpful to go through the Extras on the DVD, though some will say that the film should stand on its own merits. In this instance, I disagree; go ahead and do some homework. (I went to my copy of William Manchester's fine memoir `Goodbye Darkness' to brush up a little on Tarawa.) Watch it with the sound off. Watch it with the French language track. Listen to the Director's Commentary at least once. Read the DVD historical background regarding Manzanar. Certainly give especial attention to such great acting moments as Nels' (Max von Sydow) Summation in chapter 16.If you have the interest and patience to do the research and view the film several times over several days, things wondrous and beautiful may reveal themselves to you, as they did to me. Rather than expecting an immediate reaction, consider this work as you would a complex wine, or Ansel Adams' photographs or a Gustav Mahler symphony: an artistic effort to be experienced time and again. I believe it's that good.I recommend this film highly, so Four Stars from me.Russell de Ville4 March 2006",4,Patience Required,1141430400,"03 4, 2006",2006,2909,"['love', 'Cinema', 'love', 'exploring', 'considering', 'what', 'decisions', 'fine', 'Director', 'making', 'film', ""'m"", 'certain', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'aspect', 'process.I', 'must', 'confess', ""'ve"", 'had', 'watch', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'several', 'times', 'really', 'appreciate', 'interpretation', 'artistic', 'qualities', 'Director', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'incorporated', 'had', 'read', 'book', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'forgotten', 'lot', 'detail', 'film', 'was', 'challenging', 'first.Lots', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'difficult', 'view', 'are', 'often', 'well', 'produced', 'directed', 'not', 'necessarily', 'Many', 'incorporate', 'best', 'most', 'interesting', 'actors', 'not', 'always', 'movies', 'interest', 'can', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'easy', 'watch', 'first', 'screening', 'very', 'select', 'few', 'ending', 'up', 'collection', 'point', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'hardly', 'easy', 'watch', 'category', 'truly', 'more', 'Art', 'Film.I', 're-introduced', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'film', 'reviewing', 'Soundtrack', ""'m"", 'Music', 'Teacher', 'trade', 'avocation', 'came', 'when', 'sorting', 'out', 'CDs', 'school', 'Watching', 'again', 'required', 'focus', 'concentration', 'part', 'initial', 'reaction', 'was', 'maybe', 'two', 'three-star', 'film', 'OK', 'not', 'really', 'outstanding', 'was', 'Siskel', 'Ebert', 'dis-remember', 'who', 'made', 'comment', 'effect', 'generation', 'seem', 'lack', 'patience', 'letting', 'particular', 'film', 'develop', 'letting', 'storyline', 'intricacies', 'details', 'be', 'revealed', 'gradually', 'often', 'subtly', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'instant', 'gratification', 'been', 'incorporated', 'collective', 'post-modern', 'personas', 'least', 'true', 'me.I', 'will', 'suggest', 'Snow', 'Falling', 'Cedars', 'well', 'time', 'may', 'be', 'helpful', 'read', 'book', 'again', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'may', 'be', 'helpful', 'go', 'Extras', 'DVD', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'stand', 'own', 'merits', 'instance', 'disagree', 'go', 'ahead', 'do', 'homework', 'went', 'copy', 'William', 'Manchester', 'fine', 'memoir', 'Goodbye', 'Darkness', 'brush', 'up', 'little', 'Tarawa', 'Watch', 'sound', 'Watch', 'French', 'language', 'track', 'Listen', 'Director', 'Commentary', 'least', 'once', 'Read', 'DVD', 'historical', 'background', 'regarding', 'Manzanar', 'Certainly', 'give', 'especial', 'attention', 'such', 'great', 'acting', 'moments', 'Nels', 'Max', 'von', 'Sydow', 'Summation', 'chapter', '16.If', 'have', 'interest', 'patience', 'do', 'research', 'view', 'film', 'several', 'times', 'several', 'days', 'things', 'wondrous', 'beautiful', 'may', 'reveal', 'did', 'Rather', 'expecting', 'immediate', 'reaction', 'consider', 'work', 'would', 'complex', 'wine', 'Ansel', 'Adams', 'photographs', 'Gustav', 'Mahler', 'symphony', 'artistic', 'effort', 'be', 'experienced', 'time', 'again', 'believe', 'good.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'highly', 'Four', 'Stars', 'me.Russell', 'Ville4', 'March', '2006']",N/A

The narrative in the original novel  vacilliates through time, space, and race. So no wonder those who have not  read the novel may be befuddled by the frequent shifting localities and  moods in the film version. The story evovles around the murder trial of  Kabuo Miyamoto, a hero from the WWII battlefields, who is accused of murder  in a place where generation of Japanese and whites have lived in tensile  harmony until Pearl Harbour. Most notably, the trials are brilliantly shot  and paced with a reminiscent touch of To Kill a Mockingbird. Max Von Sydow  as the defendent's lawyer, is rhetorically dazzling, very much like Patrick  Steward in his famed role as Atticus. Other members of the cast (especially  Ethan Hawke, not his best here) often drift into the complexity of the  script, and they are not given enough room to grow as individuals.  The  tender touch on individuality is certainly missing from the film version as  Hicks glides from one frame to the next, as there are much of the mystery  to be covered and elucidated. The question of inter-racial relationship is  presented with care, but not enough clarity as the audience is simply not  informed enough about the characters to be touched.But this film does  impress with its cinemotagraphy, the ficticious San Pedro island off the  coast of Washington is so breathtakingly portrayed that the draping snow  stands alone as a silent witness through out. And as the book did a  fabulous job at creating suspense, Hicks is able to weave through the drama  with the lush visual aids. And it's also to Hicks' credit to filter out the  substances that could have easily made this film R-rated. Over all, it's an  enjoyable film, but mostly to audience prepared by the novel first. The  story is a gorgeous one, with rare touches of racial indifference and  nature of hate.",3,A potential beauty falls short,962841600,"07 6, 2000",2000,2022,"['David', 'Guterson', 'enigmatic', 'beaut', 'perhaps', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'caged', 'may', 'be', 'futile', 'blame', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'scattered', 'focus', 'movie', 'follow-up', 'much', 'lauded', 'Shine', 'narrative', 'original', 'novel', 'vacilliates', 'time', 'space', 'race', 'So', 'no', 'wonder', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'may', 'be', 'befuddled', 'frequent', 'shifting', 'localities', 'moods', 'film', 'version', 'story', 'murder', 'trial', 'Kabuo', 'Miyamoto', 'hero', 'WWII', 'battlefields', 'who', 'accused', 'murder', 'place', 'where', 'generation', 'Japanese', 'whites', 'have', 'lived', 'tensile', 'harmony', 'Pearl', 'Harbour', 'Most', 'notably', 'trials', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'shot', 'paced', 'reminiscent', 'touch', 'Kill', 'Mockingbird', 'Max', 'Von', 'Sydow', 'defendent', 'lawyer', 'rhetorically', 'dazzling', 'very', 'much', 'Patrick', 'Steward', 'famed', 'role', 'Atticus', 'Other', 'members', 'cast', 'especially', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'not', 'best', 'here', 'often', 'complexity', 'script', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'enough', 'room', 'grow', 'individuals', 'tender', 'touch', 'individuality', 'certainly', 'missing', 'film', 'version', 'Hicks', 'glides', 'one', 'frame', 'next', 'are', 'much', 'mystery', 'be', 'covered', 'elucidated', 'question', 'inter-racial', 'relationship', 'presented', 'care', 'not', 'enough', 'clarity', 'audience', 'simply', 'not', 'informed', 'enough', 'characters', 'be', 'touched.But', 'film', 'impress', 'cinemotagraphy', 'ficticious', 'San', 'Pedro', 'island', 'off', 'coast', 'Washington', 'so', 'breathtakingly', 'portrayed', 'draping', 'snow', 'alone', 'silent', 'witness', 'book', 'did', 'fabulous', 'job', 'creating', 'suspense', 'Hicks', 'able', 'weave', 'drama', 'lush', 'visual', 'aids', 'also', 'Hicks', 'credit', 'filter', 'out', 'substances', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'made', 'film', 'R-rated', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'mostly', 'audience', 'prepared', 'novel', 'first', 'story', 'gorgeous', 'one', 'rare', 'touches', 'racial', 'indifference', 'nature', 'hate']",N/A

The story of a trial for murder of a Japanese-American man living in a community notyet shed of its wartime prejudices remains a compelling reminder of how easily justice is castaside.  The plot, however, pales into insignificance in view of the captivating filmingtechniques used.  A low-key presentation, every scene gives but hints of content, letting theplot build with almost infinitesimal steps.  The viewer will remained glued in place, fearful ofmissing a vital element.  Not a fast-paced adventure story, Snow Falling on Cedars isexemplary of the minor steps each life takes in its progress toward some fulfillment.  Theresolution may not be palatable, but it's unquestionably realistic.  The director deserves thehighest praise for what he's given us.Fans of Ethan Hawke, if such there be, may be disappointed in this role.  He remains merely aface glimpsed in passing as the story unfolds.  Any pretty, love-sick Hollywood boy couldhave performed this role adequately.  He merely observes his surroundings and his past.Perhaps that's just, given that he inherited the town newspaper from his father.  Sam Shepardas the father, outshines Hawke in the few scenes he's given appearance.  The real star of thisfilm is, of course, Max von Sydow.  Von Sydow simply walks away with it as the accusedman's lawyer.  It ought to be an easy role to play.  He simply has to defend justice as an ideal.Von Sydow, however, forcefully brings a sense of exceptional humanity in his performance.He's never been better.  Were there not other elements of such fundamental importance in thisfilm that must be covered, von Sydow might have had a larger role.

Ishmael and Youki were childhood friends who spent hours together playing in the forests.  Many years later, before Ishmael is drafted off to war, they get engaged.  Ishmael is wounded in Europe and loses his arm.  While recovering in the hospital overseas, Youki sends him a letter terminating their engagement.  The letter was sent from an internment camp.After the war, Youki marries a Japanese American man.  He is wrongfully accused of a murder.  Ishmael, now a reporter, out of dedication to Youki, heroically investigates and solves the murder.  It is clear that Ishmael is still passionate about Youki.  He has had no other woman in his life.  It seems that Youki has always loved Ishmael but has buried it.Youki had terminated her relationship with Ishmael because of the difficulty of relations between white American and Americans of Japanese descent.  Ishmael never accepted this but he accepted the fact that she was now married to someone else.  Out of his dedicated love for her, he fights heroically to absolve her husband of the murder accusation.I say Youki should have not have terminated the relationship.  Lindy says, given the racial/social situation, Youki did the right think in dumping Ishmael.The filmmakers seemed  to borrow a little from ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" in the end.  The whole Japanese-American community knows about Ishmael and Youki's youthful romance, and they know what he has done for her by saving her husband.  In the final court room scene, all of the Japanese Americans in the spectators gallery stares at Ishmael in awe and silence.The film is very well made.

68881,AL277B4AQCWBG,0783240325,Steven Reynolds,"[9, 9]","Adapting this novel with its tricky, time-shifting narrative was always going to be a big task, but Scott Hicks pulls it off. He and co-writer Ron Bass move quickly into the courtroom and wisely use the trial to drive the plot, telling the backstory - the real story in this case - through a finely-woven complex of flashbacks. The difficulty is that this story is a rich, long and emotional tale which requires a fair degree of exposition for it to be satisfying. The screenplay is superbly economical in this regard, but there is no escaping the fact that the only way to cover so much ground in a film of tolerable length is to fly over it at 30,000 feet. The necessarily distant treatment this requires only occasionally dilutes the emotional force which would have come from a more thorough and leisurely telling. Hicks compensates with a powerfully emotive score - this works, but it doesn't always hit the mark. Rather than engendering emotion, James Newton Howard's music is often so insistently overpowering that it locks the audience out.  But that's a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent production. Overall, this is an intelligent and considered adaptation - probably the best that could be made from a novel which would have been incredibly difficult to bring to the screen. It's solidly acted, immaculately lit, and offers some of the most achingly beautiful imagery to illuminate the screen in years.  (The opening sequence is magnificent.)  Most rewarding of all is the fact that Hicks takes some real stylistic risks with this film. They don't always pay off, but when they do it's magical.",4,Exceptional,1022803200,"05 31, 2002",2002,1608,"['Adapting', 'novel', 'tricky', 'time-shifting', 'narrative', 'was', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'big', 'task', 'Scott', 'Hicks', 'off', 'co-writer', 'Ron', 'Bass', 'move', 'quickly', 'courtroom', 'wisely', 'use', 'trial', 'drive', 'plot', 'telling', 'backstory', 'real', 'story', 'case', 'finely-woven', 'complex', 'flashbacks', 'difficulty', 'story', 'rich', 'long', 'emotional', 'tale', 'fair', 'degree', 'exposition', 'be', 'satisfying', 'screenplay', 'superbly', 'economical', 'regard', 'escaping', 'fact', 'only', 'way', 'cover', 'so', 'much', 'ground', 'film', 'tolerable', 'length', 'fly', '30,000', 'feet', 'necessarily', 'distant', 'treatment', 'only', 'occasionally', 'emotional', 'force', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'more', 'thorough', 'leisurely', 'telling', 'Hicks', 'powerfully', 'emotive', 'score', ""n't"", 'always', 'hit', 'mark', 'Rather', 'engendering', 'emotion', 'James', 'Newton', 'Howard', 'music', 'often', 'so', 'insistently', 'overpowering', 'audience', 'out', 'minor', 'flaw', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'production', 'Overall', 'intelligent', 'considered', 'adaptation', 'probably', 'best', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'novel', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'bring', 'screen', 'solidly', 'acted', 'immaculately', 'lit', 'most', 'achingly', 'beautiful', 'imagery', 'illuminate', 'screen', 'years', 'opening', 'sequence', 'magnificent', 'Most', 'rewarding', 'fact', 'Hicks', 'real', 'stylistic', 'risks', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'pay', 'off', 'when', 'do', 'magical']",N/A

I know that people react to films differently based on their personality and what their expectations are.  Personally I hate big-budget epic films with loads of effects and weak characters & plot.  And since Hollywood makes great money off of those kind of movies, that seems to be what the general public wants.""Snow Falling on Cedars"", I will admit, has a rather basic story, but it's a powerful one that is important to help future generations appreciate the time period.  The music is chilling, haunting, and very powerful (I even bought the soundtrack). But what I really want to get to is the LOOK of this picture.The effects and transitions used in this film are gorgeous.  What I mean by effects is mostly camera tricks and editing (not CGI etc).  Every scene is shot like a painting that could be framed.  The lighting, the angles, the AMAZING transitions are stunning.  Director Scott Hicks took the novel and used the medium of film in a most unique way to convey a story.  There are so many stunning sequences that truly are poetry in motion.So why should you see the film?  Well executed, superb cast, and a story that should be told for future generations.

Flanigan Jr.,"[0, 0]","Too many plot threats (played out against backgrounds of major historical events) are stuffed into this too long and, consequentially, sometimes too boring film.  Basically, it is a tale of: childhood sweethearts (overly done with plenty of repetitious scenes to puff up the run time); a murder trial with parallel outside-the-courtroom events (done well except for the notable absence of the words &#8220;objection your honor&#8221; in the defense lawyer&#8217;s script); and culture clashes (magnified significantly by what happened domestically during WWII).  A fine cast delivers fine performances.  Especially the leading actress who provides a low-keyed, but powerful reading leaving the viewer wanting to see more of the same--always the mark of a accomplished actress!  The script cleverly telegraphs future events, but, when events are becoming obvious, annoyingly tends to hammer this information into the viewer. Cinematography is outstanding.  Film score over doses on violin solos, and often distracts from rather than adds to the film&#8217;s fabric.  Then there is dialog dubbing.  This post-production art form comes up short.  Lip synching is noticeably poor in several close-ups.  And an unusually large number of dubbing actors are listed in the credits.  (Subtitles for the surprisingly little Japanese that is on the sound track are not provided.)  So who is speaking and when (and what was originally said)?  Just curious.

The dreamy style and constant snow/rain create quite an effective moody atmosphere.  Ethan Hawke does a decent job playing the local newsman. These are what the 3 stars are for.While the story is riveting, it's not particularly intriguing. To make a good movie out of this story, it has to take lots of good acting, thought-provoking screenplay and sensitive direction. Unfortunately, the movie does not quite have these few elements.1) The acting is kind of minimal. By that I'm not saying the actors are bad necessarily, but just that probably they don't have sufficient opportunities to make their characters come alive.2) The characters' dialogues, over all, do little more than is required to make a tangible story.  There are some ""speeches"" about fairness and justice (Ishmael's (Hawke) father's lecture to his son, and the closing argument of the defense attorney (von Sydow)). But they are like more intended to hammer the ""lesson"" into the audience's heads than to let us get a deeper view of what the characters are psychologically going through.3)  As many previous reviewers have commented, there are just way too many flashbacks. I know that to link the past history to the current event, some sort of flashback is good. But it gets to the point of annoying when there's a flashback every 3 minutes or so. And to repeat what a reviewer has said, the voiceover of the reading of the love letter written by the Japanese girl is just terrible. I just don't get the point.I don't know if the director tried to make this movie an epic. But if so, he failed quite miserably. Attempts were made to deal with many diverse issues: prejudice, love, wars, parenthood, etc. But the development of these issues relied too heavily on flashbacks. As a result, there're many stand-alone flashbacks, with some totally unrelated to another. There's not so much of a thread linking all these coherently. Also, some flashbacks are a bit shallow. Sometimes I can't help feeling that they're there just to show off the beautiful photography. Narcissism? Or being too pretentious? Hmm... and the score sometimes sounds too ""grand"" and ""overstating.""If you're the kind of person who has the mood for listening to light classic in a coffee shop while watching it rain outside, probably this movie would suit you the way a nice coffee-table book would. You know, sometimes you just want to let yourself indulge in the mood for a bit.
