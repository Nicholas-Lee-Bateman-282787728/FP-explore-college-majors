Kephart ""Allen K.""","[1, 1]","This is one classic show that will live on just like ""I Love Lucy"" and other classic shows (Lucy is another favorite of mine).  To say that this show went out with a bang is an understatement.  I watched this show when it was originally run on NBC (I watched Monday nights at 8 p.m. on KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles).  I have the entire series on DVD and am enjoying the series again.It is too bad that there will probably not be a reunion of the Michael Landon version of Little House.  Even though he is gone, I feel it could be done.  His son Michael Landon Jr. is doing some family movies nowadays.  He could direct.  Also, the real Charles Ingalls died in 1902.  Following the fact that the Little House series was based approximately 100 years in the past, it would stand to reason that the Michael Landon version of Charles Ingalls also passed away.  As far as the rest of the cast participating, I remember watching the Little House mini-reunion on the Today Show.  When asked if they would be interested in doing a reunion show, Alison Arngrim (who played Nellie Oleson) said ""When do we start?"".  I am sure that she was echoing the sentiments of the rest of the surviving cast.  Besides Michael Landon, the cast members who have passed on are Victor French (Mr. Edwards), Kevin Hagen (Doc Baker), and Dabbs Greer (Reverend Alden).  Richard Bull and Katherine MacGregor are still living (they played Mr. and Mrs. Oleson).  It would be an interesting movie if they did it, although I hear that somebody else owns the rights and that may be what is holding it up.",5,An Explosive End To A Wonderful Series,1208649600,"04 20, 2008",2008,1570,"['one', 'classic', 'show', 'will', 'live', 'just', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'other', 'classic', 'shows', 'Lucy', 'favorite', 'mine', 'say', 'show', 'went', 'out', 'bang', 'understatement', 'watched', 'show', 'when', 'was', 'originally', 'run', 'NBC', 'watched', 'Monday', 'nights', '8', 'p.m.', 'KNBC', 'Channel', '4', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'have', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'am', 'enjoying', 'series', 'again.It', 'too', 'bad', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'be', 'reunion', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'version', 'Little', 'House', 'Even', 'gone', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'son', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'Jr.', 'doing', 'family', 'movies', 'nowadays', 'could', 'direct', 'Also', 'real', 'Charles', 'Ingalls', 'died', '1902', 'Following', 'fact', 'Little', 'House', 'series', 'was', 'based', 'approximately', '100', 'years', 'past', 'would', 'stand', 'reason', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'version', 'Charles', 'Ingalls', 'also', 'passed', 'away', 'As', 'far', 'rest', 'cast', 'participating', 'remember', 'watching', 'Little', 'House', 'mini-reunion', 'Today', 'Show', 'When', 'asked', 'would', 'be', 'interested', 'doing', 'reunion', 'show', 'Alison', 'Arngrim', 'who', 'played', 'Nellie', 'Oleson', 'said', 'When', 'do', 'start', 'am', 'sure', 'was', 'echoing', 'sentiments', 'rest', 'surviving', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'cast', 'members', 'who', 'have', 'passed', 'are', 'Victor', 'French', 'Mr.', 'Edwards', 'Kevin', 'Hagen', 'Doc', 'Baker', 'Dabbs', 'Greer', 'Reverend', 'Alden', 'Richard', 'Bull', 'Katherine', 'MacGregor', 'are', 'still', 'living', 'played', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Oleson', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'movie', 'did', 'hear', 'somebody', 'else', 'rights', 'may', 'be', 'what', 'holding', 'up']",N/A

I do recomend you watch the nine seasons first and the viewer will get a good understanding of this collectors edition. Its very warm ,sad indeed,and frustrating. Fate is a funny word to all these three movies that I saw. The first one is the story of Albert whos future is backed off when he wants to become a doctor is encounterd of a physical problem. The second one is when something happens to Amonso and Lauras little daughter Rose  when they by acidently leave it behind. The last one called the last Farewell is the ending of what happens to a town we all loved seeing becomes taken away. Its a real unplesant feeling when you put these three movies together. But it tells you something what could happen with out knowing. The packaging of the box set is really nice. Good photgraphs of the characters. It opens really nice.Comes with two bonus DVDS theres a quiz of Multiple choice questions to test your knowledge.There tricky! You should  think of the questions sometimes twice before answering.

1004692,ACOO1NZKALM44,B000GIXCFQ,AzureBlu,"[4, 4]","I'm glad that they decided to wrap all the Little House movies in one nice little package. Like many others, I grew up with this series and I still enjoy watching them today as I did when I was younger. Strangly, I didn't really know about the movies until later in my life, so it was kind of nice to enjoy the Little House eps (or movies) when I was old enough to enjoy them more.Look Back to Yesterday...To me, this is by FAR the most emotional and inspirational Little House movie (including all of the episodes of the series) I have seen. Towards the end you are crying like a baby, but it's still great. So if your in the mood for a good cry, this is it guys. It's worth it! ;)Bless All the Dear Children...This was a different one that centers around the Wilder family. Almonzo and Laura are struggling to find baby Rose who was kidnapped by a mentally emotional woman who lost a child. She finds Rose to fill her missing gap and claims her as her own. All is well in the end and it will definately leave a smile to your face.The Last Farewell...Oh WHY did it have to end this way! It's sad, but it definatly fits the personality of the Walnut Grove residents where they refuse to give in to the ""higher-ups"". But when they have no choice but to surrender, they do what they think is best and they literally blow up all of the buildings with dynamite. It's sad to see it because every building has such a history behind it. I love the part when Reverend Alden says, ""It was not in Vain"" and everyone walks out of town singing ""Onward, Christian Soldiers"".

1004699,A1A9YDBK0RE237,B000GIXCFQ,D. Zimmerman,"[174, 179]","UPDATE 1-20-2014:  Did you know that this series will now start to be released on blu-ray?  Do an Amazon search for ""Little House on the Prairie Season 1 Deluxe Remastered Edition Blu-ray"".  This is great news for all ""Little House"" fans!(Updated) Series on a whole: 5 stars++.  Stories on this particular set: 4-1/2 stars.  Video quality: 3-1/2 stars.  Extras: 4 stars.Why would I call this the ""Best series in the history of television""?  ...because it's BIG in heart and soul, the characters and stories have TREMENDOUS depth, and it's not bogged down by the politics of your typical western, or typical show for that matter.  The storylines could go anywhere, and focus on anyone, or anything.  There didn't have to be a villain of the week, a murder, etc.  Come to think of it, this is one of the most ""murder-less"" westerns I have ever seen.  If people died, it was more from life's hardships in the 1800's than from anything else.  It may not have ended anywhere near as well as it came in, but when you look back at the series on a whole, I would still rank this as being the best of all TV series, and for a number of reasons.The appeal of this series is much broader than most people give it credit for.  The show wasn't just for little girls, as anyone looking at the cover of one of the Little House books might conclude.  It was more a show about how to deal with the unexpected, with changes in life, and how to get along with your neighbors.  There are life lessons to be learned here for everyone, from little girls to old men.I doubt that we will ever again see a show quite like this, which so graciously teaches the lost values that we need in times like these.  Network TV has become a desolate wasteland of high-tech crime scene dramas, court case TV, reality TV, infomercials, talk shows, extreme sports, and news programs.  You will be hard-pressed to find much of a heart or soul in any of them, mainly just a lot of computer ""gee-whiz"" wizardry, and for the most part a waste of time in general.  Meanwhile, Little House delivers both heart AND soul, so much so in the subtle ways that it influences you, that you can't help but walk away a better person afterwards.Even if they did bring a show like this back (and they`ve tried), it would be EXTREMELY difficult to match the production values you will find here without a sky-high budget.  Not to mention, many of the best character actors once employed by Hollywood, (many of whom appeared on Little House), are now long since dead.SPOILERS FOLLOW...  About this particular set...  After Season 9 ended, a deal was inked to conclude the ""Little House on the Prairie"" series with the final three tele-movies contained here, the UNOFFICIAL ""Season 10"", which wraps up the series in a very peculiar and jaw-dropping way, literally going out with a BANG!!Whether or not anyone likes the idea of the town being blown to smithereens in the end, or with the direction the series took in it's later years, Michael Landon and crew continued to crank-out very touching, emotionally-charged episodes to the bitter end.  Casting, acting, directing, writing, set design, and the beautiful, harmonious music composed by the late David Rose all remained high-quality throughout the series.  I can't say enough about the fine acting and music though, as well as the town layout - all First Class!  Well... There were a few less than stellar casting decisions near the end of the run, but nothing worth spoiling the series over.The final three films are somewhat of a mixed bag, and leave you with mixed emotions.  I probably would have wrote them a bit differently if it were up to me, but they are still VERY MUCH worth the price of admission.  The saddest, and my choice as the best of the three would be the first one, ""Look Back To Yesterday"", which will likely produce a few tears (video and sound quality is very good to excellent).  As for ""Bless All The Dear Children"", the story is somewhat uneven and seems to drag in the middle, however the ending is quite good, and redeems any flaws.  In all honesty though, I can't figure out why on earth they felt the need to tell this particular story as one of the last three of all time (video quality is good to very good).  ""The Last Farewell""... What can I say?... Does anybody really want to see the town get blown-up??  Michael Landon has always told stories about overcoming great adversity, and carrying on, but I feel that he took things a little too far here, maybe for no other reason than simply because he could.  Not the best note for the series to go out on, but a very dramatic exit nonetheless, and once again it may bring you to tears.  The video quality on this one, which I would have expected to be great, being the final installment, was actually the WORST of the three.  The print that Imavision used for the transfer was surprisingly not the greatest.  It was fairly dark, and the colors were faded.  A real disappointment, as I expected something better for what I paid.  Concerning the extras, the interviews of the two Melissa's were quite well done.  I was hoping for more extras though.A few odds & ends and closing comments...  If I had any say with the powers that be, I would NOT have destroyed the exterior town setting at the Big Sky Movie Ranch (a big chunk of the ranch was recently sold to developers), and rather would have tried to preserve it as a museum/tour/theme park/resort, for all to enjoy in the years that followed.  Not a chance of that happening now of course, after the final episode, plus the land around the shooting location is being developed like mad.  Very poor decisions in the end by those responsible.I would also like to add that while MANY of the episodes from Season box sets 1 through 3 were drop-dead GORGEOUSLY restored, I would like to see some kind of effort put into restoring the remainder of the series, which was very much a disappointing (to say the least!) ""hit and miss"" restoration effort, even if I have to pay for them all over again for the improved versions in another release of some kind.  The series was THAT GOOD!!Question:  Why has there never been a music CD compilation of David Rose's best work from this series?  They can put out a 4-disc collection of the original one-season Battlestar Galactica, but nothing for David Rose's Little House work?? ...someone who is considered to be the best in the business??R.I.P., Little House, and thanks to all involved for putting on such a fine show.  You have created a masterpiece that will be enjoyed for generations to come.  Now if only Imavision or somebody else would restore the episodes that so desperately need it from the original 35mm prints, like they did with several of the early episodes, then we would really have something special.",5,Best series in the history of television,1156636800,"08 27, 2006",2006,6791,"['UPDATE', '1-20-2014', 'Did', 'know', 'series', 'will', 'now', 'start', 'be', 'released', 'blu-ray',

After the show ended its nine season run in 1983, Michael Landon came out with three movie specials which are in this box set. It was a great way to finalize the series, because the last episode of season nine didn't give us closure and it's my guess that they probably didn't know they were getting cancelled when they completed filming for season nine.""A Look Back to Yesterday"" has us saying good-bye to Albert Ingalls as sadly, he has an incurable blood disorder (I think similar to leukemia). One grave error that they make in season 9 is that when Albert comes back to Walnut Grove with Charles and goes through Morphine Withdrawal, at the end of the episode, Laura narrates and says that Albert comes back to Walnut Grove years later as doctor. This can't be true if he dies. Anyway, it's really touching movie.""Bless All the Dear Children"" is about the kidnapping of Laura and Almanzo's daughter Rose at Christmas. Touching, you'll want to watch it as a holiday special each Christmas.""The Last Farewell"" is indeed just that-the real ending of the Little House series. A greedy land developer buys the land that Walnut Grove sits on. Ma and Pa come back to Walnut Grove for a visit. And after a valiant stand by the towns' people, they realize they cannot save the town from this greedy man taking it over and decide to blow up the town because he may have taken over the land the town was on but the town's people built the building that were there. It was very sad to see them blow the town up at the end. Thank God they didn't blow up the church though. It's been said that Michael Landon didn't want any other production companies using the Little House set so they decided to end the show this way. In the end, the land developer is furious at the destruction he sees and the town people march out of the town feeling victorious. QUITE AN ENDING TO AN UNFORGETTABLE SERIES!!!What also makes this box set special is the exclusive interviews with Melissa Gilbert(Laura) and Melissa Sue Anderson (Mary).It's interesting to hear about the special bond that Melissa Gilbert had with Michael Landon and rapport with other cast members. She was very enthusiastic and happy to talk about her Little House experience.Melissa Sue Anderson was very gracious but perhaps a little more subdued in her account of her time with Little House. I got the feeling that she felt a little resentful that she wasn't given more storylines towards the end of her time on the show. I also got the feeling from the way Melissa Gilbert and she both talked about one another that they weren't exactly as close as sisters on the set. Perhaps a little undercurrent. Melissa Gilbert was actually pretty good friends with Alison Arngrim (Nellie).At any rate they are both great interviews to watch.

1004717,A3N48NHTSIIJ1,B000GIXCFQ,Mark Ebert,"[4, 6]","These three television specials aired from late 1983 to early 1984 and were the last words Michael Landon had to say regarding the adventures of Laura Ingalls Wilder.By this time, of course, many of the characters were no longer based on the actual people in the books, but the spirit of the television series continued to emulate the literature.LOOK BACK TO YESTERDAYCharles and Albert return to Walnut Grove when it becomes clear that Albert has a serious illness.  This is perhaps the most difficult of the films to watch, not for lack of talent or story, but because it carries a somber tone.BLESS ALL THE DEAR CHILDRENThis is the strongest of the three installments.  The story reunites Isaiah Edewards, Laura, and Elmonzo as the search for the couple's kidnapped child.  The sub-plot with the Carter Family is the best of the three.  A great film to watch annually during the Christmas season.THE LAST FAREWELLSomething of a controversial end to the beloved series that was enjoyed for being more sweet than sour.  I believe Michael Landon was making a statement about where television was heading and taking a stand as he brought his acclaimed series to an end.  This installment far outshines ""Look Back to Yesterday"", but will most certainly be difficult for some fans to swallow.I have grown up with the ""Little House"" series and have great respect for most of the beliefs and values that Mr. Landon propogated on this show.  These tele-pictures represent the last three statements he made through this set of characters and circumstances.  He would never again return to the past for inspiration, but looked to contemporary times for ""Highway to Heaven"" and the short-lived ""Us"" series.",4,"Three ""Little House"" Films Makes One Great Box Set",1164844800,"11 30, 2006",2006,1697,"['three', 'television', 'specials', 'aired', 'late', '1983', 'early', '1984', 'were', 'last', 'words', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'had', 'say', 'regarding', 'adventures', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder.By', 'time', 'course', 'many', 'characters', 'were', 'no', 'longer', 'based', 'actual', 'people', 'books', 'spirit', 'television', 'series', 'continued', 'emulate', 'literature.LOOK', 'BACK', 'TO', 'YESTERDAYCharles', 'Albert', 'return', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'when', 'clear', 'Albert', 'serious', 'illness', 'perhaps', 'most', 'difficult', 'films', 'watch', 'not', 'lack', 'talent', 'story', 'somber', 'tone.BLESS', 'DEAR', 'CHILDRENThis', 'strongest', 'three', 'installments', 'story', 'Isaiah', 'Edewards', 'Laura', 'Elmonzo', 'search', 'couple', 'kidnapped', 'child', 'sub-plot', 'Carter', 'Family', 'best', 'three', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'annually', 'Christmas', 'season.THE', 'LAST', 'FAREWELLSomething', 'controversial', 'end', 'beloved', 'series', 'was', 'enjoyed', 'being', 'more', 'sweet', 'sour', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'was', 'making', 'statement', 'where', 'television', 'was', 'heading', 'taking', 'stand', 'brought', 'acclaimed', 'series', 'end', 'installment', 'far', 'Look', 'Back', 'Yesterday', 'will', 'most', 'certainly', 'be', 'difficult', 'fans', 'swallow.I', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'Little', 'House', 'series', 'have', 'great', 'respect', 'most', 'beliefs', 'values', 'Mr.', 'Landon', 'propogated', 'show', 'tele-pictures', 'represent', 'last', 'three', 'statements', 'made', 'set', 'characters', 'circumstances', 'would', 'never', 'again', 'return', 'past', 'inspiration', 'looked', 'contemporary', 'times', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'short-lived', 'Us', 'series']",N/A

Now this completes my LHOTP set. If you're a die hard fan like myself, or even a casual viewer, you'll want to own this box set. these movies are some of the series most powerful ever. In A Look Back To Yesterday, Matthew Labortaux gives an incredibly heartwrenching performance. Have the Kleenex handy, you'll need it! Michael Landon, as always, delivered a moving performance, (the man was brilliant, what more can I say!) as does Melissa Gilbert. Bless The Dear Children was entertaining, although I'll admit I thought it might have more of a climactic ending, but very enjoyable and watchable in my opinion. My favorite of the three however is The Last Farewell. This was an explosive (no pun intended lol) ending to the most beloved series ever. The acting and the story was unparallel.

1004723,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B000GIXCFQ,Sean Pasek,"[17, 19]","This boxed set includes two of my all-time favorite Little House films.  There's a big reason why the final season of Little House just didn't have the same feel as the all of the ones before it.  Even though the series was about Laura Ingalls Wilder, the true pivotal character has always been Charles.  Michael Landon created one of the most memorable characters in television history.  When he left the show during the final season, it was like a hole was left behind and unable to be filled.  Little House simply wasn't the same.Thankfully, however, Michael Landon reprises his role in two of these final movies that ended the series so wonderfully.The first film, ""Bless All the Dear Children,"" is okay at best.  It is not a great installment.  While the premise is good, (Rose is kidnapped by an emotionally disturbed woman while Laura and Almanzo are Christmas shopping), it simply isn't carried off well.  This is supposed to be December in Minnesota, and yet everyone is dressed like it's southern California (where the series was filmed).  All other Christmas episodes featured snow and cold weather to make the location more realistic.  There are also some parts of the story that just don't add up very well.  The final confrontation with the kidnapper is simply too easy and unrealistic.  The part with the ""star"" over where the little boy is sleeping is also too big of a leap.  It was a valiant try.Second we have my all-time favorite episode/feature: ""Look Back to Yesterday.""  This episode features Albert and Charles returning to Walnut Grove, initially as Charles' job as a new shipping manager sends him to help the people of Walnut Grove find a way to compete with the larger farms of the area.  The trip turns into a nightmare when Charles discovers that Albert is dying of a deadly disease.  I remember this episode shocking everyone, as it was rare that a major character like Albert was being ""killed off.""  It's a true Little House tear-jerker, with Albert fulfilling some of his last dreams.  Michael Landon simply knew how to get the most out of a scene and the most out of his actors.  This is vintage Little House at its finest!  The final climb of the mountain by Albert, Laura, and the school kids is one of the most memorable scenes in the series' history.  Albert and Laura were always very close characters in the series, and Landon knew to focus a good portion of the story on the relationship between these two characters.Finally, we get to the very last episode ""The Last Farewell,"" in which a land prospector decides to take over the town, forcing the citizens of Walnut Grove into a fight they can't possibly win.  Karen Grassle reprises her role as Caroline Ingalls as she and Charles head back to Walnut Grove for a visit and find themselves right in the middle of the takeover.  The story starts off light and ends in true sentimental fashion.  The final fifteen minutes will make even the hardest heart melt as we witness the final fate of Walnut Grove.The series had definitely done its best for nearly 9+ seasons.  With Michael Landon at the helm and performing in the last two episodes, he made sure that Little House ended the best way possible.  Any true Little House fan can't be disappointed with this set.  I had been looking forward to the release of these television movies for years, and I was so happy when they finally came out.",4,"One Good, and Two Great ""Movies"" Makes This Set a Treasure",1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,3385,"['boxed', 'set', 'two', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'Little', 'House', 'films', 'big', 'reason', 'why', 'final', 'season', 'Little', 'House', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'same', 'feel', 'ones', 'Even', 'series', 'was', 'Laura', 'Ingalls', 'Wilder', 'true', 'pivotal', 'character', 'always', 'been', 'Charles', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'created', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'characters', 'television', 'history', 'When', 'left', 'show', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'hole', 'was', 'left', 'behind', 'unable', 'be', 'filled', 'Little', 'House', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'same.Thankfully', 'however', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'role', 'two', 'final', 'movies', 'ended', 'series', 'wonderfully.The', 'first', 'film', 'Bless', 'Dear', 'Children', 'okay', 'best', 'not', 'great', 'installment', 'premise', 'good', 'Rose', 'kidnapped', 'emotionally', 'disturbed', 'woman', 'Laura', 'Almanzo', 'are', 'Christmas', 'shopping', 'simply', ""n't"", 'carried', 'off', 'well', 'supposed', 'be', 'December', 'Minnesota', 'yet', 'everyone', 'dressed', 'southern', 'California', 'where', 'series', 'was', 'filmed', 'other', 'Christmas', 'episodes', 'featured', 'snow', 'cold', 'weather', 'make', 'location', 'more', 'realistic', 'are', 'also', 'parts', 'story', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'very', 'well', 'final', 'confrontation', 'kidnapper', 'simply', 'too', 'easy', 'unrealistic', 'part', 'star', 'where', 'little', 'boy', 'sleeping', 'also', 'too', 'big', 'leap', 'was', 'valiant', 'try.Second', 'have', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'episode/feature', 'Look', 'Back', 'Yesterday', 'episode', 'Albert', 'Charles', 'returning', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'initially', 'Charles', 'job', 'new', 'shipping', 'manager', 'help', 'people', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'find', 'way', 'compete', 'larger', 'farms', 'area', 'trip', 'nightmare', 'when', 'Charles', 'Albert', 'dying', 'deadly', 'disease', 'remember', 'episode', 'shocking', 'everyone', 'was', 'rare', 'major', 'character', 'Albert', 'was', 'being', 'killed', 'off', 'true', 'Little', 'House', 'tear-jerker', 'Albert', 'fulfilling', 'last', 'dreams', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'simply', 'knew', 'how', 'get', 'most', 'scene', 'most', 'actors', 'vintage', 'Little', 'House', 'finest', 'final', 'climb', 'mountain', 'Albert', 'Laura', 'school', 'kids', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'series', 'history', 'Albert', 'Laura', 'were', 'always', 'very', 'close', 'characters', 'series', 'Landon', 'knew', 'focus', 'good', 'portion', 'story', 'relationship', 'two', 'characters.Finally', 'get', 'very', 'last', 'episode', 'Last', 'Farewell', 'land', 'prospector', 'take', 'over', 'town', 'forcing', 'citizens', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'fight', 'ca', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'win', 'Karen', 'Grassle', 'role', 'Caroline', 'Ingalls', 'Charles', 'head', 'back', 'Walnut', 'Grove', 'visit', 'find', 'right', 'middle', 'takeover', 'story', 'light', 'true', 'sentimental', 'fashion', 'final', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'will', 'make', 'even', 'hardest', 'heart', 'melt', 'witness', 'final', 'fate', 'Walnut', 'Grove.The', 'series', 'had', 'definitely', 'done', 'best', 'nearly', '9+', 'seasons', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'helm', 'performing', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'made', 'sure', 'Little', 'House', 'ended', 'best', 'way', 'possible', 'true', 'Little', 'House', 'fan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'set', 'had', 'been', 'looking', 'forward', 'release', 'television', 'movies', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'happy', 'when', 'finally', 'came', 'out']",N/A

Why did it have to end this way?  It was just too much for me to take.When something went wrong in the television series, there was always a light at the end of the tunnel... something wonderful that came out of the darkness.  Here, in these movies, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.  Only tragedy and sorrow.  I really wish I'd never watched them.  Maybe I identify too closely with the characters.  The movies are certainly well written and may appeal to those who aren't so wound up in the series.  If you'd rather remember Walnut Grove as it was however, I would encourage you to avoid these movies.  The one exception (and the one DVD I really enjoyed in this last series) was the one in which they interviewed Melissa Gilbert.  This DVD is definitely worth watching.
