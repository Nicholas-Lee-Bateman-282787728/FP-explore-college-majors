BUT the DVD itself was in great condition and I was very happy with the delivery from the seller. Very professional and honest. I would differently buy from him again and highly recommend him. Just the DVD itself wasn't for me.,5,Just ok,1362355200,"03 4, 2013",2013,334,"['was', ""n't"", 'crazy', 'DVD', 'music', 'sleep', 'Love', 'skaters', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'slow', 'BUT', 'DVD', 'was', 'great', 'condition', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'delivery', 'seller', 'Very', 'professional', 'honest', 'would', 'differently', 'buy', 'again', 'highly', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'was', ""n't""]",An Evening With Scott Hamilton & Friends

794417,A3OHRL7FT5W75N,B00016XN02,red edward 53,"[0, 1]","I personally love ice skating; I think too much time was spent on the singer Feinsteine. If he so special let him have his own show, then see how many people tune in. The singing brought an overall Blah to the whole show. I give three stars because I know how hard these skaters train for their skating. I will say this, when Michael quit singing his piano playing was very good,I respect the time he put in learning to to this. But really when I buy a video about skating a want to see the skaters. I also don't like the fact; that the person emceeing is not a skater himself.",3,scoyy hamilton and friends,1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,577,"['personally', 'love', 'ice', 'skating', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'singer', 'Feinsteine', 'so', 'special', 'let', 'have', 'own', 'show', 'then', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'tune', 'singing', 'brought', 'overall', 'Blah', 'whole', 'show', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'know', 'how', 'hard', 'skaters', 'train', 'skating', 'will', 'say', 'when', 'Michael', 'quit', 'singing', 'piano', 'playing', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'respect', 'time', 'put', 'learning', 'really', 'when', 'buy', 'video', 'skating', 'want', 'see', 'skaters', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'fact', 'person', 'emceeing', 'not', 'skater']",An Evening With Scott Hamilton & Friends

794419,AQW0DI8M0W9LC,B00016XN02,"StargazySkye ""bookaholic""","[5, 5]","I love ice skating, have seen Scott Hamilton live and have a huge respect for him as a skater and as a man. I am a long time fan of Michael Feinstein and have seen him on stage. I especially enjoy going to see him when he appears at his supper club, Feinstein's, at the Lowe's Regency in NYC. This DVD is the next best thing to having been in the audience for an amazing show. In fact, it is better in some ways. Along with the show, you get interviews, behind the scenes footage and some terrific camera's eye views of the skaters' footwork.I did not even look at the other reviews until just now, because I knew I would love it. I guess I can sympathize with some of the comments, in that skating events very seldom include live music. When the musical performance is ""in the can,"" all you have to do is look at the skaters. I attended a taping performance of an ice show with some live music provided by Sarah Brightman and it was a challenge to decide between watching the skaters and watching Sarah. Personally, I bought this equally for the music and the skating (or maybe even a little more for the musical  performance) and I was not disappointed by Michael, Darlene Love or the band. However, I have never enjoyed skating more.One thing I do not enjoy about skating shows or competitions is the butchered musical arrangements created to fit the skating program. Here, you have a perfectly integrated performance where the musical arrangements are frequently stretched to allow the skaters more scope. A special instance is one of my favorite Feinstein interpretations: ""My Favorite Year."" The song had special meaning for the skaters and they were given ample opportunity to show that emotion in their dance. Scot Hamilton's performance of ""Only One Life"" is a piece of grand theatre all by itself.If music is just something they play so the skaters have a pattern to follow, this may not be the DVD for you. If, on the other hand, the music is an integral part of your enjoyment of the skating performance, as is obviously the case for these famous and marvelous skaters, then you need this DVD. You will laugh, maybe shed a tear and groan at the awful jokes as you would at a wonderful play. I watched the extra features first and I recommend that process. You will learn some information about the skaters and the show that will add to your enjoyment.",5,Scott & Michael - Perfect together!,1335571200,"04 28, 2012",2012,2363,"['love', 'ice', 'skating', 'have', 'seen', 'Scott', 'Hamilton', 'live', 'have', 'huge', 'respect', 'skater', 'man', 'am', 'long', 'time', 'fan', 'Michael', 'Feinstein', 'have', 'seen', 'stage', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'going', 'see', 'when', 'supper', 'club', 'Feinstein', 'Lowe', 'Regency', 'NYC', 'DVD', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'having', 'been', 'audience', 'amazing', 'show', 'fact', 'better', 'ways', 'show', 'get', 'interviews', 'scenes', 'footage', 'terrific', 'camera', 'eye', 'views', 'skaters', 'footwork.I', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', 'just', 'now', 'knew', 'would', 'love', 'guess', 'can', 'sympathize', 'comments', 'skating', 'events', 'very', 'seldom', 'include', 'live', 'music', 'When', 'musical', 'performance', 'can', 'have', 'do', 'look', 'skaters', 'attended', 'taping', 'performance', 'ice', 'show', 'live', 'music', 'provided', 'Sarah', 'Brightman', 'was', 'challenge', 'decide', 'watching', 'skaters', 'watching', 'Sarah', 'Personally', 'bought', 'equally', 'music', 'skating', 'maybe', 'even', 'little', 'more', 'musical', 'performance', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Michael', 'Darlene', 'Love', 'band', 'However', 'have', 'never', 'enjoyed', 'skating', 'more.One', 'thing', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'skating', 'shows', 'competitions', 'butchered', 'musical', 'arrangements', 'created', 'fit', 'skating', 'program', 'Here', 'have', 'perfectly', 'integrated', 'performance', 'where', 'musical', 'arrangements', 'are', 'frequently', 'stretched', 'allow', 'skaters', 'more', 'scope', 'special', 'instance', 'one', 'favorite', 'Feinstein', 'interpretations', 'Favorite', 'Year', 'song', 'had', 'special', 'meaning', 'skaters', 'were', 'given', 'ample', 'opportunity', 'show', 'emotion', 'dance', 'Scot', 'Hamilton', 'performance', 'Only', 'One', 'Life', 'piece', 'grand', 'itself.If', 'music', 'just', 'something', 'play', 'so', 'skaters', 'have', 'pattern', 'follow', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'DVD', 'other', 'hand', 'music', 'integral', 'part', 'enjoyment', 'skating', 'performance', 'obviously', 'case', 'famous', 'marvelous', 'skaters', 'then', 'need', 'DVD', 'will', 'laugh', 'maybe', 'shed', 'tear', 'groan', 'awful', 'jokes', 'would', 'wonderful', 'play', 'watched', 'extra', 'features', 'first', 'recommend', 'process', 'will', 'learn', 'information', 'skaters', 'show', 'will', 'add', 'enjoyment']",An Evening With Scott Hamilton & Friends
