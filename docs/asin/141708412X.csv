In this season, the show has matured and we get to see the characters develop as each one faces difficult challenges.  I also noticed that they are finding new ways of showcasing specific talents.  We have already heard the pipes of Holling and Shelly, but we had no idea that Marilyn could be such a stirring story teller, or that Walt could be so funny.  That's always what the show has been about, but this season seems better thought out.  There is a clear trajectory in the story.As always, the writing is just brilliant, delivering some of the best dialogue ever written for television.  I just finished the final episode last night and now I want to watch the whole thing from season one over again.  I forgot just how much I missed it.I must be honest, though.  I have a personal bias.  The second episode of Disc 5 is about a wheelchair race.  There are people using wheelchairs everywhere.  Being a wheelchair user who is so sick of able bodied actors playing the disabled, I truly appreciated this.If you were ever a fan of the show, I highly reccomend this.  If not, well, it could be a bit of an acquired taste.

173994,A1D1MIFRSG50Y3,141708412X,Mike S.,"[1, 1]","This was really the show's swan song.  Although there were good episodes in season 6, especially the season premier which should have, in my opinion been a series finale, the show just lost too much steam after the 5th season, and just kind of sputtered to the end.  Ever since the 3rd season Rob Morrow was in contract disputes with the show runners, which resulted in lost screen time for his character.  While it does seem that the Joel Fleischman character was around more in season 5 than he was in season 4, there were still times when you could feel an absence of the character.Because of that situation many episodes really became stand alone.  The biggest ongoing storyline of the season was Shelly's pregnancy.  The episode where she gives birth is one of the best of the season, where she sees her daughter throughout various stages of her life in the laundromat throughout the show.  The season did also see Maggie and Joel kind of get together as a couple.  Because of Morrow's reduced role it never really gets going very well though, and in one episode it seems like they are seriously dating, then the next it will be like they are back to casual friends.The main theme of the show really does just revolve around the quirkiness of the town and the people who live in it.The issue with the original music continues throughout the rest of the series.  Like was the case from season 3 forward, some of the original songs were removed because of licensing.  It is pretty obvious when a song is missing because it is replaced with canned instrumental elevator music.  So even if you do not remember what song was supposed to be in the episode, you can tell when one is missing.  There are some people who cannot get over the fact that universal did not pay to have all the original music, and if you are one of them then you will want to skip this.The show is definitely an acquired taste.  It can get a little weird and out there.  And given that it was on the air before the whole politically correctness thing kicked in, there are certainly things that, if you are ultra sensitive and easily offended, can turn you off.  In ways it was a show unique for its time because it had Native American themes and influenced, discussed environmental issues and even global warming, long before it became a political debate, and even tackled gay marriage.As far as extras go, this set is lighter than the other seasons.  It has deleted and extended scenes for select episodes (about 40 minutes worth) on disc 5.  There are no gag reels or commentaries or cast interviews.  If you were a fan of the show, and can get around the music issue, this season is definitely well worth picking up.",5,The last really great season of the show,1403308800,"06 21, 2014",2014,2693,"['was', 'really', 'show', 'swan', 'song', 'were', 'good', 'episodes', 'season', '6', 'especially', 'season', 'premier', 'should', 'have', 'opinion', 'been', 'series', 'finale', 'show', 'just', 'lost', 'too', 'much', 'steam', '5th', 'season', 'just', 'kind', 'sputtered', 'end', 'Ever', '3rd', 'season', 'Rob', 'Morrow', 'was', 'contract', 'disputes', 'show', 'runners', 'resulted', 'lost', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'seem', 'Joel', 'Fleischman', 'character', 'was', 'around', 'more', 'season', '5', 'was', 'season', '4', 'were', 'still', 'times', 'when', 'could', 'feel', 'absence', 'character.Because', 'situation', 'many', 'episodes', 'really', 'became', 'stand', 'alone', 'biggest', 'ongoing', 'storyline', 'season', 'was', 'Shelly', 'pregnancy', 'episode', 'where', 'birth', 'one', 'best', 'season', 'where', 'daughter', 'various', 'stages', 'life', 'laundromat', 'show', 'season', 'did', 'also', 'see', 'Maggie', 'Joel', 'kind', 'get', 'together', 'couple', 'Morrow', 'reduced', 'role', 'never', 'really', 'going', 'very', 'well', 'one', 'episode', 'are', 'seriously', 'dating', 'then', 'next', 'will', 'be', 'are', 'back', 'casual', 'friends.The', 'main', 'theme', 'show', 'really', 'just', 'revolve', 'around', 'quirkiness', 'town', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'it.The', 'issue', 'original', 'music', 'rest', 'series', 'was', 'case', 'season', '3', 'forward', 'original', 'songs', 'were', 'removed', 'licensing', 'pretty', 'obvious', 'when', 'song', 'missing', 'replaced', 'canned', 'instrumental', 'elevator', 'music', 'So', 'even', 'do', 'not', 'remember', 'what', 'song', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'episode', 'can', 'tell', 'when', 'one', 'missing', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'fact', 'universal', 'did', 'not', 'pay', 'have', 'original', 'music', 'are', 'one', 'then', 'will', 'want', 'skip', 'this.The', 'show', 'definitely', 'acquired', 'taste', 'can', 'get', 'little', 'weird', 'there', 'given', 'was', 'air', 'whole', 'politically', 'correctness', 'thing', 'kicked', 'are', 'certainly', 'things', 'are', 'ultra', 'sensitive', 'easily', 'offended', 'can', 'turn', 'off', 'ways', 'was', 'show', 'unique', 'time', 'had', 'Native', 'American', 'themes', 'influenced', 'discussed', 'environmental', 'issues', 'even', 'global', 'warming', 'long', 'became', 'political', 'debate', 'even', 'tackled', 'gay', 'marriage.As', 'far', 'extras', 'go', 'set', 'lighter', 'other', 'seasons', 'deleted', 'extended', 'scenes', 'select', 'episodes', '40', 'minutes', 'worth', 'disc', '5', 'are', 'gag', 'reels', 'commentaries', 'cast', 'interviews', 'were', 'fan', 'show', 'can', 'get', 'music', 'issue', 'season', 'definitely', 'well', 'picking', 'up']",N/A

Then I missed the last two seasons so I was really happy to see that they came out on DVD.  The impact of the original show may have lessened a little over the years but it is still well worth watching.  Chris, the Jungian-quoting, ex-con DJ is one of the best characters ever created on TV, IMHO.  All of the others are still shining too--Maggie seems softer and sweeter with her hair grown longer.  Fleishman is still Fleishman--annoying and neurotic but he has some nice moments, too.  Holling and Shelly have expanded their family.  Ed is always adorable and in this season he gets the call to become a shaman.  RuthAnn gets a boyfriend.

173997,A1D702T7C8VDBL,141708412X,"R. Howell ""boriskhan""","[9, 10]","We return once again to Cicely, Alaska with a visit to the oddball characters of a small middle-of-nowhere town that usually makes a tv show a hit. As far as the product itself, it's the standard fair of a boxed set, great crisp clean photos from the series on the packaging and easy to follow menus on the discs. With this season, we get five discs, one sided this time out which I feel helps the viewing out because no you don't have to be constantly flipping the discs over to view the next part of the series (did that make sense?). Also included at the on disc one and disc five are the deleted scenes from different episodes. Gone however are the bloopers which are missed because they are usually so fun to watch.As for the show itself, this was the season that was going to determine the future of the series. For me, the early part of the season lacked that certain something in the stories that were such a hit in the previous seasons. There is a change in the writing and lack of good stories in the early season. I still enjoy them but that extra 'perkiness' is absent. Mid season sees three religion influence episodes come in and the latter part of the season returns to the fully entertaining aspects that was the cast and setting. We are introduced to recurring characters like Cal the violinist and locales like Walt Kupfer, Hayden Keys, Adam, and Office Semansky begin taking larger recurring roles (especially Walt, he figures prominantly into season 5). Changes are made to the regulars, including Ed from film afficianado into shaman, the arrival of Holling and Shelly's baby, and the officially dating of Joel and Maggie. A bit of a minor annoyance is the episodes are aired out of sequence of when they were filmed. You can judge the order on your own by taking note of Chris 'in the Morning' Stephens' hair length and beard growth.Overall, it's a delight to continue into the past and relive the entire Northern Exposure setting and enjoy the kooky characters/stories. Packaging is standard, this one in brilliant purple with individual photo enhanced disc boxes.
