30202,A1S3C5OFU508P3,0780621549,Charles Ashbacher,"[7, 18]","As a political junkie, I followed the political career of Ronald Reagan from his unsuccessful campaign for president in 1976 through the inauguration of George Bush in 1989. I saw the deepest economic recession of this half-century in the early years of his presidency, annual budget deficits that dwarfed what had come earlier, trading arms for hostages and violations of the law regarding the funding of the Nicaraguan contras. His policies of tax cuts and massive military spending came very close to bankrupting the country. After the massive tax cuts in the initial year, the economy went downhill and it recovered only after taxes were increased. His rhetoric in dealing with the Soviet Union was more bellicose than that of all other American Presidents, and in an earlier age could have led to a nuclear confrontation.There were also major successes during his tenure. The cold war essentially ended, with the United States emerging victorious. The economy rebounded very well in the middle 1980's, achieving growth rates that were impressive. However, if you listen to some of his supporters, his presidency was an unqualified success, as they tend to forget what went wrong.What is impressive about this tape is that it does show all of the aspects of his presidency, capturing the essence and distance of the man. While he projects an image of engagement and emotional attachment to people, he is actually very detached in his personal life. His relationship with his children was very strained and those who know him best say he really has no close personal friends. Extensive interviews are done with his children and co-workers, as they try to describe a man that they admit is very difficult to describe.However, the most interesting segments of the tape concern his policies as president. He is someone who has unshakable beliefs and he held them to the last, although he was more adaptable than is generally thought.  Even when he was speaking his most warlike rhetoric he was anguishing about the consequences. His contact with the nuclear freeze movement was the most telling, as he simply could not understand their position. The quotations from his diary describe his innermost thoughts and show a man that is a deeper thinker than anyone thought.As a passionate man, Ronald Reagan generates great passion among those who love him and those who hate him. However, there is one aspect that no one can dispute. He is a man of great personal courage, as he was able to joke even when an assassin's bullet was threatening to take his life. His letter to the American people explaining his battle with Alzheimer's disease is one of the most moving pieces of literature that you will ever read. I was never a supporter of Ronald Reagan the politician, but after viewing this tape, I do not understand how anyone could not be a supporter of Ronald Reagan the man. He may not have been a great president, but he is a great man.",4,Balanced account of the good/bad aspects of his career,1027468800,"07 24, 2002",2002,2940,"['political', 'junkie', 'followed', 'political', 'career', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'unsuccessful', 'campaign', 'president', '1976', 'inauguration', 'George', 'Bush', '1989', 'saw', 'deepest', 'economic', 'recession', 'half-century', 'early', 'years', 'presidency', 'annual', 'budget', 'deficits', 'dwarfed', 'what', 'had', 'come', 'earlier', 'trading', 'arms', 'hostages', 'violations', 'law', 'regarding', 'funding', 'Nicaraguan', 'contras', 'policies', 'tax', 'cuts', 'massive', 'military', 'spending', 'came', 'very', 'close', 'bankrupting', 'country', 'massive', 'tax', 'cuts', 'initial', 'year', 'economy', 'went', 'downhill', 'recovered', 'only', 'taxes', 'were', 'increased', 'rhetoric', 'dealing', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'was', 'more', 'bellicose', 'other', 'American', 'Presidents', 'earlier', 'age', 'could', 'have', 'led', 'nuclear', 'confrontation.There', 'were', 'also', 'major', 'successes', 'tenure', 'cold', 'war', 'essentially', 'ended', 'United', 'States', 'emerging', 'victorious', 'economy', 'rebounded', 'very', 'well', 'middle', '1980', 'achieving', 'growth', 'rates', 'were', 'impressive', 'However', 'listen', 'supporters', 'presidency', 'was', 'unqualified', 'success', 'tend', 'forget', 'what', 'went', 'wrong.What', 'impressive', 'tape', 'show', 'aspects', 'presidency', 'capturing', 'essence', 'distance', 'man', 'projects', 'image', 'engagement', 'emotional', 'attachment', 'people', 'actually', 'very', 'detached', 'personal', 'life', 'relationship', 'children', 'was', 'very', 'strained', 'who', 'know', 'best', 'say', 'really', 'close', 'personal', 'friends', 'Extensive', 'interviews', 'are', 'done', 'children', 'co-workers', 'try', 'describe', 'man', 'admit', 'very', 'difficult', 'describe.However', 'most', 'interesting', 'segments', 'tape', 'concern', 'policies', 'president', 'someone', 'who', 'unshakable', 'beliefs', 'held', 'last', 'was', 'more', 'adaptable', 'generally', 'thought', 'Even', 'when', 'was', 'speaking', 'most', 'warlike', 'rhetoric', 'was', 'anguishing', 'consequences', 'contact', 'nuclear', 'freeze', 'movement', 'was', 'most', 'telling', 'simply', 'could', 'not', 'understand', 'position', 'quotations', 'diary', 'describe', 'innermost', 'thoughts', 'show', 'man', 'deeper', 'thinker', 'anyone', 'thought.As', 'passionate', 'man', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'great', 'passion', 'who', 'love', 'who', 'hate', 'However', 'one', 'aspect', 'one', 'can', 'dispute', 'man', 'great', 'personal', 'courage', 'was', 'able', 'joke', 'even', 'when', 'assassin', 'bullet', 'was', 'threatening', 'take', 'life', 'letter', 'American', 'people', 'explaining', 'battle', 'Alzheimer', 'disease', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'pieces', 'literature', 'will', 'ever', 'read', 'was', 'never', 'supporter', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'politician', 'viewing', 'tape', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'how', 'anyone', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'supporter', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'man', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'president', 'great', 'man']",The American Experience - Ronald Reagan VHS
30203,A2FS38D943KX12,0780621549,chefdevergue,"[7, 12]","Partisans on either side will not be happy with the portrayal of Ronald Reagan.  Those on the left will feel that Reagan continues to be held up as some sort of demigod, while those on the right will bristle at any criticism of Reagan's &quot;disengaged&quot; style of presidential leadership.  I definitely do not fall into the category of a Reagan supporter &amp; I believe the man is sometimes given more credit than he is due for world events that were unfolding long before he assumed the presidency.  Nonetheless, I think that this documentary gives credit where credit is due in regards to Reagan's accomplishments.In the wake of Reagan's death and the attendent eulogizing, it is important to remember that Reagan's presidency had both its high points &amp; low points, and also that his political record long precedes his occupancy of the White House.Two main themes run through the documentary:  Reagan's unflagging belief in the greatness of the American nation (and by extension, his belief in his own capacity to restore the US to what he saw as its former greatness), and his dogged opposition to the threat of Communism as he perceived it.  Again and again, the producers return to these themes, sometimes for the better &amp; sometimes for the worse.On the negative side (for me at least), this tends to reduce Reagan's foreign policy to a rather one-dimensional approach.  Obviously, in this limited format it is impossible to chronicle Reagan's foreign policy day-by-day, but some significant omissions need to be discussed.  Not the least of these would be the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, Reagan's response to it, and the subsequent invasion of Grenada (which many people believe was an effort to distract the public from Beirut).  Additionally, the bombing of Tripoli should have been examined to show that Reagan responded to the threat of terrorism in a variety of ways.  One can also point to the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines to demonstrate that Reagan was not uniformly an interventionist.  One would have thought that Marcos, a staunch ally of the US in the Pacific Rim and an opponent of communism, could have successfully appealed to Reagan for military intervention.  Yet, the Reagan administration (to its credit, I believe) did not intervene and let events unfold on their own.Some critics of this documentary complain that it gives Reagan too little credit for causing the collapse of the Soviet Union.  All I can say to that is that they need to look at the bigger picture, going back to Truman, and realize that the Soviet collapse was a long long time in the making.  Actually, very little discussion is devoted to the USSR collapse, which is probably a good thing.  It has been less than 13 years since the collapse, and the last card has yet to be played in this game.  It needs to be pointed out that the Communist Party in Russia is alive and well --- the legislature is filled with party members, and the Prime Minister is a former member of the KGB.  It is hard to argue that Russian communism has done anything other than change its stripes a bit.  The Cold War may be over (although with China still firmly communist, how can anyone definitively say that?), but it is still too early to tell.  Just remember, the Bourbons in France were out of power from 1791 to 1815 --- 24 years, folks.  It is best to wait another generation before making a true assessment of Reagan's legacy regarding this paricular topic.Thankfully, this documentary avoids doing that.  However, it is hard to look at this documentary as being particularly definitive for that very reason.  Enough time has not yet passed for us truly to be able to assess Reagan's true legacy.  We should accept this documentary as the best that can be produced until another one comes along --- and I suspect that it will be more than a few years before that happens.",4,Pretty good documentary that will not please partisans,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,3900,"['Partisans', 'side', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'happy', 'portrayal', 'Ronald', 'Reagan', 'left', 'will', 'feel', 'Reagan', 'be', 'held', 'up', 'sort', 'demigod', 'right', 'will', 'bristle', 'criticism', 'Reagan', 'quot', 'disengaged', 'quot', 'style', 'presidential', 'leadership', 'definitely', 'do', 'not', 'fall', 'category', 'Reagan', 'supporter', 'amp', 'believe', 'man', 'sometimes', 'given', 'more', 'credit', 'due', 'world', 'events', 'were', 'unfolding', 'long', 'assumed', 'presidency', 'Nonetheless', 'think', 'documentary', 'credit', 'where', 'credit', 'due', 'regards', 'Reagan', 'accomplishments.In', 'wake', 'Reagan', 'death', 'attendent', 'eulogizing', 'important', 'remember', 'Reagan', 'presidency', 'had', 'high', 'points', 'amp', 'low', 'points', 'also', 'political', 'record', 'long', 'occupancy', 'White', 'House.Two', 'main', 'themes', 'run', 'documentary', 'Reagan', 'unflagging', 'belief', 'greatness', 'American', 'nation', 'extension', 'belief', 'own', 'capacity', 'restore', 'US', 'what', 'saw', 'former', 'greatness', 'dogged', 'opposition', 'threat', 'Communism', 'perceived', 'Again', 'again', 'producers', 'return', 'themes', 'sometimes', 'better', 'amp', 'sometimes', 'worse.On', 'negative', 'side', 'least', 'reduce', 'Reagan', 'foreign', 'policy', 'rather', 'one-dimensional', 'approach', 'Obviously', 'limited', 'format', 'impossible', 'chronicle', 'Reagan', 'foreign', 'policy', 'day-by-day', 'significant', 'omissions', 'need', 'be', 'discussed', 'Not', 'least', 'would', 'be', 'bombing', 'Marine', 'barracks', 'Beirut', 'Reagan', 'response', 'subsequent', 'invasion', 'Grenada', 'many', 'people', 'believe', 'was', 'effort', 'distract', 'public', 'Beirut', 'Additionally', 'bombing', 'Tripoli', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'examined', 'show', 'Reagan', 'responded', 'threat', 'terrorism', 'variety', 'ways', 'One', 'can', 'also', 'point', 'overthrow', 'Ferdinand', 'Marcos', 'Philippines', 'demonstrate', 'Reagan', 'was', 'not', 'uniformly', 'interventionist', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'Marcos', 'staunch', 'ally', 'US', 'Pacific', 'Rim', 'opponent', 'communism', 'could', 'have', 'successfully', 'appealed', 'Reagan', 'military', 'intervention', 'Reagan', 'administration', 'credit', 'believe', 'did', 'not', 'intervene', 'let', 'events', 'unfold', 'own.Some', 'critics', 'documentary', 'complain', 'Reagan', 'too', 'little', 'credit', 'causing', 'collapse', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'can', 'say', 'need', 'look', 'bigger', 'picture', 'going', 'back', 'Truman', 'realize', 'Soviet', 'collapse', 'was', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'making', 'Actually', 'very', 'little', 'discussion', 'devoted', 'USSR', 'collapse', 'probably', 'good', 'thing', 'been', 'less', '13', 'years', 'collapse', 'last', 'card', 'yet', 'be', 'played', 'game', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'Communist', 'Party', 'Russia', 'alive', 'well', 'legislature', 'filled', 'party', 'members', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'former', 'member', 'KGB', 'hard', 'argue', 'Russian', 'communism', 'done', 'anything', 'other', 'change', 'stripes', 'bit', 'Cold', 'War', 'may', 'be', 'China', 'still', 'firmly', 'communist', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'definitively', 'say', 'still', 'too', 'early', 'tell', 'Just', 'remember', 'Bourbons', 'France', 'were', 'out', 'power', '1791', '1815', '24', 'years', 'folks', 'best', 'wait', 'generation', 'making', 'true', 'assessment', 'Reagan', 'legacy', 'regarding', 'paricular', 'topic.Thankfully', 'documentary', 'avoids', 'doing', 'However', 'hard', 'look', 'documentary', 'being', 'particularly', 'definitive', 'very', 'reason', 'Enough', 'time', 'not', 'yet', 'passed', 'truly', 'be', 'able', 'assess', 'Reagan', 'true', 'legacy', 'should', 'accept', 'documentary', 'best', 'can', 'be', 'produced', 'one', 'along', 'suspect', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'few', 'years']",The American Experience - Ronald Reagan VHS

After watching it, though, I have a great appreciation for Reagan and the job he did as president. The Cold War needed to end, and it would not have ended but for  his presidency. I am intrigued by the things that make Reagan who he is.  He is a religious man; indeed, his presidency was one long sermon against  communism.  His growth (particularly after the assasination attempt) is  shown well in the video, climaxing at the end of his presidency when he  conceded that the Soviet Union was not an evil empire (this moment was  especially touching since you were able to see the emotion in Reagan's  eyes). This video also deals well with the big weakness in Reagan's  leadership style (e.g., delegating way too much--which led directly to the  Iran-Contra scandal).  It's scary how much he could be disconnected with  reality, but this facet of his character is presented as only one part of  this complex man.

It got bogged down too much in the protest lines and slow economy that were present in the ealry part of Reagan's administration.  During one part of the film, the narrator states "" some Americans disagreed with the President's policies""...and as this is being said, it's showing protestors dressed in devil costumes and others wearing skull masks marching in the streets.  Excuse me, some Americans ?!!  I'm not saying that these marching malcontents weren't Americans, but they certainly aren't normal, common sense kind of people.  More like dope-smoking anarchists.This scene drags out for some time with melancholy music.  Other parts of the film show extended scenes of Americans in umemployment lines or many liberal politicians decrying Reagan's policies toward the Soviets.  I don't mind some mention of this, but these scenes are much too extended and as we now know.....history has proved these politicians and protestors manifestly wrong.As George Washington said ' lay your shoulders to the main points and the minutia will follow"".....well, all of these protestors and whining politicians ended up being the 'minutia' of history.  The main points?  Reagan's tax cuts and his policy of peace through strength in dealing with the Soviet empire.  Alas, to the film's credit, the success of these policies is eventually explained, documented and admitted to.The U.S. economy's 'fever broke' so to speak once the effects of Reagan's economic policies kicked in.  The result; an unprecedented economic boom resulting in robust employment, economic growth and more tax revenue to the government.  The beneficial results of these policies exist to this day.  The film does bemoan that spending wasn't curbed much, but that was the fault of the democrat-controlled congress who wouldn't cut unnecessary social programs.  The military buildup was necessary to defeat the threat of nuclear holocaust by the Soviets.As mentioned above, the film chronicles the fact that Reagan's foreign policy was heavily responsible for the USA winning the cold war and the dissolution of communist Russia.In summary, PBS, known for their leftest viewpoints are dragged kicking and screaming into admitting that Reagan's economic stance grew the economy out of the Carter recession.  The film also begrudgingly shows the success of this President's strategy in dealing with the USSR.  The facts of history wouldn't allow for it to be rewritten, even by PBS.

Think how your perspective on what you could do with your life might be different if you knew you had saved the lives of 77 people. Everything that explains Reagan's adult character can be found in his early experiences, all here in this well-done film.I regret that the other American Experience programs on U.S. presidents lack such careful analysis of early experience.
