1120738,A16J9STS34PWWC,B000YQK14K,,"[16, 25]","""Southland Tales"" is a sublimely, spectacularly awful movie.  Really, really, REALLY awful.  So awful, in fact, that it goes through awful and come out the other side, like Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" meets ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""I'm not ever going to try to recap the plot...it involves SoCal and the apocalypse.  Any deeper understanding and your brain will begin to melt.  It does help, though, to read the Prequel Saga (the graphic novel, available on Amazon but not in any bookstore I've gone into).  The Prequel Saga at least gives you a better picture of the world you're entering...a near future even more futuristic then we ever anticipated.This movie works best when you simply consider it as a series of moments.  Think of it as several dozen very short films that are being presented together for your viewing pleasure.  Only then can you appreciate Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar, who uses a wide-eyed earnestness here that is so un-Buffylike that at first you hardly believe it's her) and her porn-star posse debating the ethics of abortion and quantum mechanics on a reality show on the beach.  Or Dion (Wood Harris) and Dream's (Amy Poehler with the fakest fake nose I've ever seen) hysterical ""domestic dispute.""  Or even the commercial where two SUVs get it on.  Yes, two cars f***.  I can't make this stuff up.This movie has a great cast...I mean, Zelda Rubinstein!  Christopher Lambert!  Kevin Smith!  Granted, you barely get to see any of those people, because there are SO MANY PEOPLE in the cast that it's hard to keep track of them all.  (Watch for the looks on each actor's face.  They all have a sort-of stunned, ""what is this movie?  How did I get here?  What have I done?"" look on their faces.  Poor Sean William Scott looks like someone must have kidnapped his grandmother and forced him to do this movie as ransom.)  A few stand outs, though, were Justin Timberlake as Pilot Abilene--Timberlake drunkenly lip-sychs to The Killers ""All These Things That I've Done"" with a s***-eating smirk on his face that tells me that HE gets the joke that is this movie.  Also Cheri Oteri, who usually annoys the heck out of me but here plays a really annoying character who happens to be a sociopath.  Like I said, through awful and out the other side.Music in this movie is fabulous...the aforementioned lip-synching might have been my favorite part of the movie (if god wanted to speak to ME, he'd probably do it through Killers lyrics, too).  Rebekah Del Rio (as herself) sings ""The Star-Spangled"" banner, and I felt the first stirrings of traditional patriotism that I've felt since 2004.  Moby provides an atmospheric score, which sounds basically like every other Moby song I've ever heard, but fits this movie very well.  And Kelley takes us to the credits with Blur's ""Tender,"" which was a great finish considering that the last 20-some minutes are the oddest bit in the whole film.If this review hasn't scared you off, check it out at whatever indie-theater happens to be within 200 miles of you.  Definitely read the graphic novel FIRST or you'll  be even more lost.",5,On having a happy apocalypse,1195344000,"11 18, 2007",2007,3095,"['Southland', 'Tales', 'sublimely', 'spectacularly', 'awful', 'movie', 'Really', 'really', 'REALLY', 'awful', 'So', 'awful', 'fact', 'awful', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'side', 'Dante', 'Divine', 'Comedy', 'Plan', '9', 'From', 'Outer', 'Space', ""'m"", 'not', 'ever', 'going', 'try', 'recap', 'plot', 'SoCal', 'apocalypse', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'brain', 'will', 'begin', 'melt', 'help', 'though', 'read', 'Prequel', 'Saga', 'graphic', 'novel', 'available', 'Amazon', 'not', 'bookstore', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'Prequel', 'Saga', 'least', 'better', 'picture', 'world', ""'re"", 'entering', 'near', 'future', 'even', 'more', 'futuristic', 'then', 'ever', 'anticipated.This', 'movie', 'works', 'best', 'when', 'simply', 'consider', 'series', 'moments', 'Think', 'several', 'dozen', 'very', 'short', 'films', 'are', 'being', 'presented', 'together', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'Only', 'then', 'can', 'appreciate', 'Krysta', 'Now', 'Sarah', 'Michelle', 'Gellar', 'who', 'wide-eyed', 'earnestness', 'here', 'so', 'un-Buffylike', 'first', 'hardly', 'believe', 'porn-star', 'posse', 'debating', 'ethics', 'abortion', 'quantum', 'mechanics', 'reality', 'show', 'beach', 'Dion', 'Wood', 'Harris', 'Dream', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'fakest', 'fake', 'nose', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'hysterical', 'domestic', 'dispute', 'even', 'commercial', 'where', 'two', 'SUVs', 'get', 'Yes', 'two', 'cars', 'f***', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stuff', 'up.This', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'mean', 'Zelda', 'Rubinstein', 'Christopher', 'Lambert', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Granted', 'barely', 'get', 'see', 'people', 'are', 'SO', 'MANY', 'PEOPLE', 'cast', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'Watch', 'looks', 'actor', 'face', 'have', 'sort-of', 'stunned', 'what', 'movie', 'How', 'did', 'get', 'here', 'What', 'have', 'done', 'look', 'Poor', 'Sean', 'William', 'Scott', 'someone', 'must', 'have', 'kidnapped', 'grandmother', 'forced', 'do', 'movie', 'ransom', 'few', 'stand', 'outs', 'though', 'were', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Pilot', 'Abilene', 'Timberlake', 'drunkenly', 'Killers', 'All', 'Things', ""'ve"", 'Done', 's***-eating', 'smirk', 'face', 'HE', 'joke', 'movie', 'Also', 'Cheri', 'Oteri', 'who', 'usually', 'heck', 'here', 'really', 'annoying', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'sociopath', 'said', 'awful', 'other', 'side.Music', 'movie', 'fabulous', 'aforementioned', 'lip-synching', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'god', 'wanted', 'speak', 'ME', ""'d"", 'probably', 'do', 'Killers', 'lyrics', 'too', 'Rebekah', 'Del', 'Rio', 'Star-Spangled', 'banner', 'felt', 'first', 'stirrings', 'traditional', 'patriotism', ""'ve"", 'felt', '2004', 'Moby', 'atmospheric', 'score', 'basically', 'like', 'other', 'Moby', 'song', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'Kelley', 'credits', 'Blur', 'Tender', 'was', 'great', 'finish', 'considering', 'last', '20-some', 'minutes', 'are', 'oddest', 'bit', 'whole', 'film.If', 'review', ""n't"", 'scared', 'off', 'check', 'out', 'indie-theater', 'happens', 'be', '200', 'miles', 'Definitely', 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'FIRST', ""'ll"", 'be', 'even', 'more', 'lost']",Southland Tales Theatrical Release

1120740,A3B87UZLPCF0HW,B000YQK14K,,"[3, 5]","Set in a futuristic-looking Los Angeles in 2008 as it stands on the brink of apocalyptic disaster, Southland Tales centres on Boxer Santaros (Johnston) an action star with a bout of amnesia, whose life intertwines with Krysta Now (Gellar), a determined porn star developing her own reality television project. We also meet Ronald Taverner (Scott), a police officer who may hold the key to an immeasurable conspiracy involving a militant rebel organisation, the American government, and the end of the world. These guys are the nucleus of an infinitely perplexing plot that involves an abundance of quirky characters and bizarre goings-on. Directed by Richard Kelly, who made a stunning debut six years ago with Donnie Darko, Southland was delayed after an unfinished cut screened during the Cannes Film Festival and was widely abused by the amassed critics, who quite simply did not know what to make of it. Kelly has crafted a staggeringly ambitious piece of work that exudes an intelligence and ability far beyond my feeble brain. But, as a film designed to entertain and stimulate, it falls considerably short of not just his debut, but of a much-needed narrative lucidity that engages us as an audience. The problems here are vast and frustrating, but even when scratching your head in confusion, or frowning at another seemingly redundant character, you can almost feel the profusion of ideas dying to rear their heads long enough for you to grasp them. Kelly has raw talent like no other director of his generation, that much is plainly clear; but he needs to evolve into a director with a sense of control and focus, as large parts of this bang of over-indulgence. I have no doubt that Kelly will make other great films - but Southland Tales is never anything more than a beautiful mess-a beautiful mess I enjoyed.",4,Film int&eacute;ressant,1197158400,"12 9, 2007",2007,1821,"['Set', 'futuristic-looking', 'Los', 'Angeles', '2008', 'brink', 'apocalyptic', 'disaster', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'Boxer', 'Santaros', 'Johnston', 'action', 'star', 'bout', 'amnesia', 'life', 'intertwines', 'Krysta', 'Now', 'Gellar', 'determined', 'porn', 'star', 'developing', 'own', 'reality', 'television', 'project', 'also', 'meet', 'Ronald', 'Taverner', 'Scott', 'police', 'officer', 'who', 'may', 'hold', 'key', 'immeasurable', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'militant', 'rebel', 'organisation', 'American', 'government', 'end', 'world', 'guys', 'are', 'nucleus', 'infinitely', 'perplexing', 'plot', 'abundance', 'quirky', 'characters', 'bizarre', 'goings-on', 'Directed', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'who', 'made', 'stunning', 'debut', 'six', 'years', 'ago', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'Southland', 'was', 'delayed', 'unfinished', 'cut', 'screened', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'was', 'widely', 'abused', 'amassed', 'critics', 'who', 'quite', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'make', 'Kelly', 'crafted', 'staggeringly', 'ambitious', 'piece', 'work', 'intelligence', 'ability', 'far', 'feeble', 'brain', 'film', 'designed', 'entertain', 'stimulate', 'considerably', 'short', 'not', 'just', 'debut', 'much-needed', 'narrative', 'lucidity', 'audience', 'problems', 'here', 'are', 'vast', 'frustrating', 'even', 'when', 'scratching', 'head', 'confusion', 'frowning', 'seemingly', 'redundant', 'character', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'profusion', 'ideas', 'dying', 'rear', 'heads', 'long', 'enough', 'grasp', 'Kelly', 'raw', 'talent', 'other', 'director', 'generation', 'much', 'plainly', 'clear', 'evolve', 'director', 'sense', 'control', 'focus', 'large', 'parts', 'bang', 'over-indulgence', 'have', 'doubt', 'Kelly', 'will', 'make', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'never', 'anything', 'more', 'beautiful', 'mess-a', 'beautiful', 'mess', 'enjoyed']",Southland Tales Theatrical Release

1120742,AX8UXTLF70B8Q,B000YQK14K,3-006,"[4, 5]","I have been following the progress of this film for about three years or so, reading about the constant re-writing of the screenplay, the re-shooting, the re-editing -- completely shifting plots and sub-plots around -- and I knew that this could only mean one thing....the movie was destined to be an obscure disaster.Of course, that is exactly what it is.  I was surprised to find, after having finally forgotten about the making of Southland Tales last fall, to come across, a few weeks ago here on this site, a DVD release date for it.  Was this even in theatres or was it straight to video?  I keep up with all the newly released films in both the giant multi-plexes and the small indie theatres and never saw this title despite living in (now near) a large city.It is fairly obvious what happened with the creation of Southland Tales...it goes like this:  Richard Kelly's movie 'Donnie Darko' achieved cult status and even moved past that to become a relatively mainstream hit even to the point of being re-released years later in Imax theatres.  That is pretty rare.  Richard Kelly was the It-Director of the mid-2000's.  Sony, hoping to capitalize on his status, signed him and basically gave him carte blanche.  Bad move for most any director, but certainly for such an inexperienced one as Kelly.Kelly, overwhelmed by his own imagination, tried to capture everything in there on film (or otherwise create it digitally), but all these ideas he had got all mixed up in his brain and the hours and hours of images did not match what he had in hs head and so he shot more and more of them and switched the screenplay around and tried to put these pieces of this maddening puzzle that his mind had created together in movie format.  The problem was -- the pieces he had were mixed up with pieces of other puzzles.  He tried jamming them together in a desperate effort to make them fit, but nothing would work.  Finally the studio gave up on him and for all intents and purposes shut down production, thereby cutting their losses.Southland Tales tries to be cool and current, but it is slow-moving and not even remotely witty.  It tries to put as many familiar faces as possible on the screen, but ends up with a bunch of C and D list celebrities and has-beens along with an action movie 'star', but no action.  A movie with a lay-out like an intense war-themed video game, but no intensity portrayed anywhere by anyone.The above reminds me slightly of David Lynch's 'Inland Empire', where Lynch basically shot a movie (or much of it) as the ideas came into his head and then put it together as he went along and then through the editing process.  The major difference is this:  David Lynch is both experienced and supremely talented.  Kelly, well, he kinda isn't.Sony made a very bad judgment trying to, basically, cash in on the success of 'Darko' and the 'fan-boys' and got reamed for it.  Too bad for them.  But even worse for Kelly, because I find it difficult to believe that he will be trusted like he was trusted by Sony ever again.  This was a film-maker's dream, but Kelly totally blew it.Southland Tales is a poorly crafted movie that is essentially pointless and ultimately boring.Anyone up for the 'Return of Donnie Darko'?",2,No Amount of Re-Writes Could Have Saved This Movie; An Obscure Disaster,1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,3239,"['have', 'been', 'following', 'progress', 'film', 'three', 'years', 'so', 'reading', 'constant', 're-writing', 'screenplay', 're-shooting', 're-editing', 'completely', 'shifting', 'plots', 'sub-plots', 'knew', 'could', 'only', 'mean', 'one', 'thing', '.the', 'movie', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'obscure', 'disaster.Of', 'course', 'exactly', 'what', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'having', 'finally', 'forgotten', 'making', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'last', 'fall', 'come', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'here', 'site', 'DVD', 'release', 'date', 'Was', 'even', 'theatres', 'was', 'straight', 'video', 'keep', 'up', 'newly', 'released', 'films', 'giant', 'multi-plexes', 'small', 'indie', 'theatres', 'never', 'saw', 'title', 'living', 'now', 'near', 'large', 'city.It', 'fairly', 'obvious', 'what', 'happened', 'creation', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'movie', ""'Donnie"", 'Darko', 'achieved', 'cult', 'status', 'even', 'moved', 'past', 'become', 'relatively', 'mainstream', 'hit', 'even', 'point', 'being', 're-released', 'years', 'later', 'Imax', 'theatres', 'pretty', 'rare', 'Richard', 'Kelly', 'was', 'It-Director', 'mid-2000', 'Sony', 'hoping', 'capitalize', 'status', 'signed', 'basically', 'gave', 'carte', 'blanche', 'Bad', 'move', 'most', 'director', 'certainly', 'such', 'inexperienced', 'one', 'Kelly.Kelly', 'overwhelmed', 'own', 'imagination', 'tried', 'capture', 'everything', 'there', 'film', 'otherwise', 'create', 'digitally', 'ideas', 'had', 'got', 'all', 'mixed', 'up', 'brain', 'hours', 'hours', 'images', 'did', 'not', 'match', 'what', 'had', 'hs', 'head', 'so', 'more', 'more', 'switched', 'screenplay', 'around', 'tried', 'put', 'pieces', 'maddening', 'puzzle', 'mind', 'had', 'created', 'together', 'movie', 'format', 'problem', 'was', 'pieces', 'had', 'were', 'mixed', 'up', 'pieces', 'other', 'puzzles', 'tried', 'jamming', 'together', 'desperate', 'effort', 'make', 'fit', 'nothing', 'would', 'work', 'Finally', 'studio', 'gave', 'up', 'intents', 'purposes', 'shut', 'down', 'production', 'thereby', 'cutting', 'losses.Southland', 'Tales', 'be', 'cool', 'current', 'slow-moving', 'not', 'even', 'remotely', 'witty', 'put', 'many', 'familiar', 'possible', 'screen', 'up', 'bunch', 'C', 'D', 'list', 'celebrities', 'has-beens', 'action', 'movie', ""'star"", 'action', 'movie', 'lay-out', 'intense', 'war-themed', 'video', 'game', 'intensity', 'portrayed', 'anywhere', 'anyone.The', 'reminds', 'slightly', 'David', 'Lynch', ""'Inland"", 'Empire', 'where', 'Lynch', 'basically', 'shot', 'movie', 'much', 'ideas', 'came', 'head', 'then', 'put', 'together', 'went', 'along', 'then', 'editing', 'process', 'major', 'difference', 'David', 'Lynch', 'experienced', 'supremely', 'talented', 'Kelly', 'well', 'kinda', ""isn't.Sony"", 'made', 'very', 'bad', 'judgment', 'trying', 'basically', 'cash', 'success', ""'Darko"", ""'fan-boys"", 'got', 'reamed', 'Too', 'bad', 'even', 'worse', 'Kelly', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'will', 'be', 'trusted', 'was', 'trusted', 'Sony', 'ever', 'again', 'was', 'film-maker', 'dream', 'Kelly', 'totally', 'blew', 'it.Southland', 'Tales', 'poorly', 'crafted', 'movie', 'essentially', 'pointless', 'ultimately', 'boring.Anyone', 'up', ""'Return"", 'Donnie', 'Darko']",Southland Tales Theatrical Release

In the post modern era we currently live in where everything seems to be homogenized to a sickening point, this movie was a welcome sore to the system. Again, if you're looking for straight up coherency you will not find it here, but I guarantee that you will fall out of your seat laughing at some of the shennanigans that take place. After watching this I will never call 'The Rock...The Rock.' Forever he will be known as Duane Johnson: actor! Not because he gives a dramatic tour de force of a performance, far from it, but because he manages to deliver inane dialogue so convincingly that you will literally fall on your stomach laughing till your guts spill out. He is that good in this which to me was shocking because I don't like the man's movies in the least bit. Everyone here does a damn good job, including Timberlake. But what made the movie resonate with me was that there's a large degree of truth to the hilarity that ensues. What would America look like if there was an Apocalyptic tragedy to occur in this current era we live in? Every movie that mentions Iraq in some context just seems trite in hindsight, and in this it's one of the main plot points, but I wasn't insulted by it in any way. Why? Again it comes down to truth. If you're aware of our current cultural landscape as it exists today then you will definitely get something out of this movie.

My wife was disgusted and picked up her book, but I kept on watching and was glad that I did, I hate to tell her that I plan to watch it again. This is not a movie for everyone and a love of dystopia and apocalyptic vision is a prerequisite for watching this film.

It seems the reviews are going towards the negative for this film. I agree: odd. But if you want entertainment, a movie with sci fi themes that you can follow, Southland Tales is it.I just watched it for fun. I didn't plan on reviewing it, but, since so many think the film is ""terrible"", I saw a reason to write.In short, you have what others are saying: A picture of how the world ends. You have Justin Timberlake, The Rock, and a ton of other young actors, or actors who seem  to specialize in more B films. This is, in many ways, a B film. It comes close to the complexity of Donnie Darko, one of my favorite films of all time. And it's far more ambitious, almost, almost realizing its ambition. While the film is odd, so was Donnie Darko. While it has some odd science fiction elements, so did Donnie Darko. The point with Donnie Darko was you didn't feel like you were traveling around the world in a huge, sprawling epic, which is what Southland Tales is.You have travels through time and memories and lost identities. You also have B movie stars rising above their general acting skills. It's a portrait of a future that could be.The soundtrack was done by Moby, which truly fit in with the odd film that Richard Kelly has here. I am not sure if I would buy it; perhaps you should watch it first.

1120748,A18S2VGUH9SCV5,B000YQK14K,Margaux Paschke,"[68, 86]","This movie cannot be summarized or explained easily so I will provide my impressions of this strangely fascinating movie.  First off, it's a long movie (over 2 hours) and the first 15 mins. confused me until I just let go of any normal movie expectations and sat back to enjoy the freak show that is Southland Tales.  There is no way this film is going to appeal to the masses and if odd movies appeal to you, then you better run out to see it at the handful of theaters playing it or wait for the dvd release.  I know I can't wait for the dvd release (please let there be commentary) for repeated viewings.  This movie was so crammed full of insight, digs and jokes that I couldn't catch every single thing.  This mind blowing version of what the USA might be like in the very near future is crazy but addictive.  I found the scene where someone questions after a commercial, ""Did I just see two cars f**k?""  ""Yes, but that was the European version"" to be very telling.  The smarmy salesman easily tosses aside any moral questions.  Are Americans being sold swamp land by Corporations?  Some might even question if the viewer is being sold a load of crap dressed up as fine art.  I think not.  The aggressive subtext was a nice touch too.  Be prepared for very crude dialogue - I found it amusing but it might not appeal to others.  The against-type casting was a stroke of brilliance (Sarah Michele ""Buffy"" Gellar as a porn star and Mandy Moore as a I can't say without giving things away).  Obscure references were a treat such as the Baron's ""Dune"" overtones and Kevin Smith (not easily recognizable) evokes the Wizard of Oz.  I loved the light handed social commentary.  This film never came off as preachy but made it's point of view on serious issues nonetheless (it's not for the war in Iraq for starters): they used a heavy technology vibe to get some points across (there are many scenes with several computer screens on view with running commentary underneath each screen); the national anthem was being sung in Spanish to start and then continued in English; the energy crisis resolution was pure sci-fi; and the Revelations from the Bible, as read by Timberlake, were played out by the characters (Revelation that apocalypse will be brought on by a pregnant woman (Moore) surrounded by a dragon (tattoo on Mei Ling's back) and two beasts (you get the point).  A lot of attention was given to the minute detail of this movie and that dedication showed.  The ""Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" subplot was amusing and only one example of what this movie was all about to me - a joke, and it invited us all to enjoy it with them.  At IDent, all the employees wore these see-through plastic jackets that meant what? They looked out-of-place and silly.  Soon, the same exact question was sarcastically being asked by an onscreen actor.  Another example is when Kysta Now (porn star) attempts to sell her screen play (who doesn't in LA?  apparently not even a looming doomsday can stop Hollywood) with such typical blondness (""apparently, the future is much more futuristic then scientists thought"") that one actor cannot keep a straight face.  Everyone else is nodding along but this one actor cannot stop laughing to himself.  It all seems to be a joke and some of the actors got it and some didn't.  It's almost as if two sets of scripts were handed out on this film, one set said it was a dark comedy and the other set said this was a serious film about the future of America.  Fans of the director's earlier work (Donnie Darko) will not be disappointed.  This movie stands out as a film with edge that many viewers will not fully comprehend (myself included) but can certainly appreciate.  Well worth watching on the big screen to help with the enormity of the what is going on in this film but waiting for the dvd with cribnotes might help.",5,strange yet fascinating,1195430400,"11 19, 2007",2007,3847,"['movie', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'summarized', 'explained', 'easily', 'so', 'will', 'provide', 'impressions', 'strangely', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'First', 'long', 'movie', '2', 'hours', 'first', '15', 'mins', 'confused', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'normal', 'movie', 'expectations', 'sat', 'back', 'enjoy', 'freak', 'show', 'Southland', 'Tales', 'way', 'film', 'going', 'appeal', 'masses', 'odd', 'movies', 'appeal', 'then', 'better', 'run', 'out', 'see', 'handful', 'theaters', 'playing', 'wait', 'dvd', 'release', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'dvd', 'release', 'please', 'let', 'be', 'commentary', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'crammed', 'full', 'insight', 'digs', 'jokes', 'could', ""n't"", 'catch', 'single', 'thing', 'mind', 'blowing', 'version', 'what', 'USA', 'might', 'be', 'very', 'near', 'future', 'crazy', 'addictive', 'found', 'scene', 'where', 'someone', 'questions', 'commercial', 'Did', 'just', 'see', 'two', 'cars', 'f**k', 'Yes', 'was', 'European', 'version', 'be', 'very', 'telling', 'smarmy', 'salesman', 'easily', 'aside', 'moral', 'questions', 'Are', 'Americans', 'being', 'sold', 'swamp', 'land', 'Corporations', 'might', 'even', 'question', 'viewer', 'being', 'sold', 'load', 'crap', 'dressed', 'up', 'fine', 'art', 'think', 'not', 'aggressive', 'subtext', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'too', 'Be', 'prepared', 'very', 'crude', 'dialogue', 'found', 'amusing', 'might', 'not', 'appeal', 'others', 'against-type', 'casting', 'was', 'stroke', 'brilliance', 'Sarah', 'Michele', 'Buffy', 'Gellar', 'porn', 'star', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'giving', 'things', 'away', 'Obscure', 'references', 'were', 'treat', 'such', 'Baron', 'Dune', 'overtones', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'not', 'easily', 'recognizable', 'Wizard', 'Oz', 'loved', 'light', 'handed', 'social', 'commentary', 'film', 'never', 'came', 'off', 'preachy', 'made', 'point', 'view', 'serious', 'issues', 'nonetheless', 'not', 'war', 'Iraq', 'starters', 'used', 'heavy', 'technology', 'vibe', 'get', 'points', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'several', 'computer', 'screens', 'view', 'running', 'commentary', 'screen', 'national', 'anthem', 'was', 'being', 'sung', 'Spanish', 'start', 'then', 'continued', 'English', 'energy', 'crisis', 'resolution', 'was', 'pure', 'sci-fi', 'Revelations', 'Bible', 'read', 'Timberlake', 'were', 'played', 'out', 'characters', 'Revelation', 'apocalypse', 'will', 'be', 'brought', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'Moore', 'surrounded', 'dragon', 'tattoo', 'Mei', 'Ling', 'back', 'two', 'beasts', 'get', 'point', 'lot', 'attention', 'was', 'given', 'minute', 'detail', 'movie', 'dedication', 'showed', 'Vast', 'Right', 'Wing', 'Conspiracy', 'subplot', 'was', 'amusing', 'only', 'one', 'example', 'what', 'movie', 'was', 'joke', 'invited', 'enjoy', 'IDent', 'employees', 'see-through', 'plastic', 'jackets', 'meant', 'what', 'looked', 'out-of-place', 'silly', 'Soon', 'same', 'exact', 'question', 'was', 'sarcastically', 'being', 'asked', 'onscreen', 'actor', 'example', 'when', 'Kysta', 'Now', 'porn', 'star', 'sell', 'screen', 'play', 'who', ""n't"", 'LA', 'apparently', 'not', 'even', 'looming', 'doomsday', 'can', 'stop', 'Hollywood', 'such', 'typical', 'blondness', 'apparently', 'future', 'much', 'more', 'futuristic', 'then', 'scientists', 'thought', 'one', 'actor', 'can', 'not', 'keep', 'straight', 'face', 'Everyone', 'else', 'nodding', 'along', 'one', 'actor', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'laughing', 'be', 'joke', 'actors', 'got', 'did', ""n't"", 'almost', 'two', 'sets', 'scripts', 'were', 'handed', 'out', 'film', 'one', 'set', 'said', 'was', 'dark', 'comedy', 'other', 'set', 'said', 'was', 'serious', 'film', 'future', 'America', 'Fans', 'director', 'earlier', 'work', 'Donnie', 'Darko', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'out', 'film', 'edge', 'many', 'viewers', 'will', 'not', 'fully', 'comprehend', 'included', 'can', 'certainly', 'appreciate', 'Well', 'watching', 'big', 'screen', 'help', 'enormity', 'what', 'going', 'film', 'waiting', 'dvd', 'cribnotes', 'might', 'help']",Southland Tales Theatrical Release

But I loved the sincerity of Boxer Santeros, Krysta Now and Ronald/Roland Tavener. I loved the crazy neo-marxists, the goofy violence. In the end, I went back and rewatched, and suddenly pieces fell into place. There really is so much here, so many small details that are amusing, thought-provoking, or both. There are also so many cameos (where the heck did the idea of casting Christopher Lambert come from?  Loved seeing him).  I was reminded of some of David Lynch's films. (Was Rebekah Del Rio singing the national anthem an homage to her similar scene in Mulholland Drive? A nice touch.)  But whereas Lynch often seems to have some singular focus/theme, this film is all over the place.How do you really sum up in one sentence what this film is about?  It's a wake-up call that we're stupid and on a course for certain disaster if we don't do something about it. That's all well and fine, but there's so much here, criticized in so many directions, it's hard to know what to do about any of it.

If you have seen all of lynch but want more then there are a few art-house pictures out there that meet those needs including the rare Hollywood outing. Southland Tales is one of those rare outings but you have seen it done better and there is a possibility that you might not like it all but you won't know until you have tried. If you like Lynch then the chance is that you will enjoy it somewhat. At the same time I have seen art-house fans walk away from this film so it's really a gamble. If you absolutely must need a coherent film then avoid it at all costs.Southland Tales is a cross between The Fifth Element without the aliens, Strange Days and a dash of Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. It has anti-Bush messages, conspiracy theories, a biblical apocalypse and lots of sexual swearing. The story is almost impossible to discern but is about a Marxist movement in future L.A that is trying to topple a post-patriot act government by filming one of theirs in a compromising position with a porn star and a double-murder. There are so many side stories involving twins, perpetual motion, screenplays, drugs, snipers,  time travel and ice cream van gun dealers that it is impracticable to say what Southerland Tales is about but that isn't a bad thing. After all weird can be good.However Southerland Tales does go wrong at times and this is undeniable fact evident by its urgent reworking in the edit room after being seriously mauled at the Cannes film festival by its critics, many of whom reckoned it was the worst film they had ever seen. Many of those critics though have since said that this version of Southerland Tales is much better with some even going so far as to say it is in so much better shape as to be deemed entertaining. In all fairness it is amusing but there are many times when the acting fails it to the point where you think those involved are deliberately trying to be contrived. Seeing The Rock tap his fingers together constantly during the second half simply looks plain dumb. There are many moments like that to put you off. In short, the director is to blame, which is a shame, because Donnie Darko is very cool.However the director is young and this is only his second movie and let's face it, Southland Tales is better than a lot of what is on the shelves today. There are plenty direct to video releases that are simply blown away by the imagination and creativity that has gone into Southland Tales. It might not be Lynch, in fact it is categorically not, but being weird can't always to live up to such high standards of the unusual. This film will grow in time and maybe in a decade have a nice enough following to suggest that maybe you should have taken a peak while it was out.

It's a bunch of vain, disparate characters intersecting in a way that brings about the end of the world.If that's your cup of tea, jump in.  ;)  But don't be fooled by the fact that this film appears to be a thrown together impromptu mess, it's not.  It's deeply layered, and carefully put together.. it's just hard to see it on one casual viewing.The Blu ray transfer is lovely, though you will notice a little grain in some of the composite effects near the end (smoking buildings, etc).A nice bonus to this release is the inclusion of the 'Southland Tales Prequel Saga' on the disc.  You can read the whole graphic novel frame by frame, and it does add some important background material, especially about the mysterious 'FluidKarma'.. where it comes from, what it does, and why Fallujah was such a mess.This addition makes this disc a real bargain for fans of this film!",5,"the Anti-""Magnolia""",1225929600,"11 6, 2008",2008,2200,"['Aimee', 'Mann', 'songs', 'tear', 'jerker', 'scenes', 'LA', 'end', 'world', 'Huge', 'cast', 'Epic', 'set-up', 'Huge', 'budget', 'Did', 'terrible', 'box', 'office', 'even', 'now', 'growing', 'army', 'fans', '10', 'years', 'now', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'shown', 'regularly', 'college', 'campuses', 'midnight', 'people', 'showing', 'up', 'dressed', 'different', 'characters', 'film', 'shouting', 'lines', 'screen.It', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', '15', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'dark', 'satire', 'how', 'vain', 'screwed', 'up', 'American', 'culture', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'wild', 'free', 'form', 'interpretation', 'scripture', 'bothers', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'watch', 'something', 'skin', 'watch', 'again', 'Watch', '7', 'times', 'clearer', 'clearer', 'what', 'more', 'see', 'just', 'too', 'dense', 'get', 'one', 'sitting', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', ""'like"", 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'intrigued', 'different', 'layers', 'subtext', 'just', 'enough', 'watch', 'again', 'Then', 'started', 'really', 'laugh', 'jokes', 'What', 'pop', 'culture', 'free', 'poem', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'mostly', 'post', '9/11', 'ultra-right', 'mentality', 'very', 'much', 'Revelation', 'St.', 'John', '2', 'main', 'characters', 'would', 'seem', 'different', 'points', 'be', 'Jesus', 'John', 'hardcore', 'black', 'comedy.It', 'Anti-', 'Magnolia', 'really', 'bunch', 'vain', 'disparate', 'characters', 'intersecting', 'way', 'end', 'world.If', 'cup', 'tea', 'jump', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'fact', 'film', 'be', 'thrown', 'together', 'impromptu', 'mess', 'not', 'deeply', 'layered', 'carefully', 'put', 'just', 'hard', 'see', 'one', 'casual', 'viewing.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'transfer', 'lovely', 'will', 'notice', 'little', 'grain', 'composite', 'effects', 'end', 'smoking', 'buildings', 'etc', '.A', 'nice', 'bonus', 'release', 'inclusion', ""'Southland"", 'Tales', 'Prequel', 'Saga', 'disc', 'can', 'read', 'whole', 'graphic', 'novel', 'frame', 'frame', 'add', 'important', 'background', 'material', 'especially', 'mysterious', ""'FluidKarma'.."", 'where', 'what', 'why', 'Fallujah', 'was', 'such', 'mess.This', 'addition', 'real', 'bargain', 'fans', 'film']",Southland Tales Theatrical Release
