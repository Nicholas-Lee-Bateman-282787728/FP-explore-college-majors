I recommend it over other kids' videos because it is fun, not too fast-paced or cartoon animated, and the puppets are really cute.  My kids liked it.Having said that, I have a beef with the title ""Baby Einstein"" and marketing this to BABIES.  It seems to imply that watching these videos is good for babies, which they are NOT!  These videos may be great for older kids, but definitely not for babies' brains.After some research I found out that: 1) brain wave activity in babies is slower when watching television than when sleeping. 2) for every hour of television a baby watches a day, their chances of acquiring an attention deficit disorder increases by 10%,  3) for every hour of television viewed daily at 4 yrs old, there is a significant odds increase for being a bully later on, and 4)consistent, heavy television viewing (more than 2 hrs daily) throughout early childhood can cause behavior, sleep and attention problems.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under 2, and no more than two hours of media (tv, videos, video games & computers) daily after age 2!  I think it's important for parents and caregivers to be aware of this so they can make better informed choices. I hope it encourages some people to limit television usage for babies and look for other outlets when possible.For those looking to calm babies and build better brains, I recommend baby carriers because studies show that infants who are carried an extra 3 hours per day cry 40% less, and this effect is lasting over time!  Frequently held babies pick up verbal skills faster and develop better core muscle strength and balance.  Also, learning to communicate in sign language can reduce frustration and tantrums, accelerate language development and promote parent-child bonding in infants and toddlers.",3,AAP recommends no television before age 2,1316649600,"09 22, 2011",2011,1899,"[""'re"", 'going', 'buy', 'children', 'video', 'great', 'video', 'toddlers', 'recommend', 'other', 'kids', 'videos', 'fun', 'not', 'too', 'fast-paced', 'cartoon', 'animated', 'puppets', 'are', 'really', 'cute', 'kids', 'liked', 'it.Having', 'said', 'have', 'beef', 'title', 'Baby', 'Einstein', 'marketing', 'BABIES', 'imply', 'watching', 'videos', 'good', 'babies', 'are', 'NOT', 'videos', 'may', 'be', 'great', 'older', 'kids', 'definitely', 'not', 'babies', 'brains.After', 'research', 'found', 'out', '1', 'brain', 'wave', 'activity', 'babies', 'slower', 'when', 'watching', 'television', 'when', 'sleeping', '2', 'hour', 'television', 'baby', 'day', 'chances', 'acquiring', 'attention', 'deficit', 'disorder', 'increases', '10', '%', '3', 'hour', 'television', 'viewed', 'daily', '4', 'yrs', 'old', 'significant', 'odds', 'increase', 'being', 'bully', 'later', '4', 'consistent', 'heavy', 'television', 'viewing', 'more', '2', 'hrs', 'daily', 'early', 'childhood', 'can', 'cause', 'behavior', 'sleep', 'attention', 'problems.The', 'American', 'Academy', 'Pediatrics', 'television', 'children', '2', 'more', 'two', 'hours', 'media', 'tv', 'videos', 'video', 'games', 'computers', 'daily', 'age', '2', 'think', 'important', 'parents', 'caregivers', 'be', 'aware', 'can', 'make', 'better', 'informed', 'choices', 'hope', 'people', 'limit', 'television', 'usage', 'babies', 'look', 'other', 'outlets', 'when', 'possible.For', 'looking', 'calm', 'babies', 'build', 'better', 'brains', 'recommend', 'baby', 'carriers', 'studies', 'show', 'infants', 'who', 'are', 'carried', 'extra', '3', 'hours', 'day', 'cry', '40', '%', 'less', 'effect', 'lasting', 'time', 'Frequently', 'held', 'babies', 'pick', 'up', 'verbal', 'skills', 'faster', 'develop', 'better', 'core', 'muscle', 'strength', 'balance', 'Also', 'learning', 'communicate', 'sign', 'language', 'can', 'reduce', 'frustration', 'tantrums', 'accelerate', 'language', 'development', 'promote', 'parent-child', 'bonding', 'infants', 'toddlers']",N/A

The flaw in this DVD is that it doesn't give the non-hearing impared child what it needs.  Children need to see a close-up view of a face and lips, mouthing new words.  Children who can't yet talk fluidly shouldn't be losing half the screen to signing.  It's too confusing.  I have a pair of two year olds that clearly get distracted by the hand movements.  One major obstacle that most kids face when learning a language is to learn the correct pronunciation of words.  They need to see EXACTLY what the tongue and lips are doing to make a sound.  The relative size of the mouth of the signer on the screen in this DVD is too small.  The signing version should be a special feature.  Or make a non-signing version as the special feature where my babies can see a close up of a face mouthing words.

896336,A3GQWBQLT4I2X2,B0007Z9QYE,Jennifer O'Daniel,"[50, 62]","My two cents on the new DVD. My little one just turned three so we haven't bought any new BE shows in a while but we wanted this one because of the signing. My child has been learning American sign language since he was only a few months old so he loves signing shows. He likes this show and has watched it several times. It is not nearly as good as other shows we have seen that feature signing but still worth the 16.00 we spent(on sale at Target). Cameron's favorite new sign is mirror. He learned it after watching the show once and has been doing it when he is in the bathroom and can watch himself in the mirror.The BE shows are so popular it may get new people interested in signing with their little ones. So when they decide they want to learn more they will search and find other signing products that will be more helpful to them. Hint Hint do a internet search and you will find an excellent series of signing videos for children. Your kids will learn so much so fast you will be amazed.The signs they use are sometimes difficult as has already beenmentioned. I didn't feel they were wrong or not ASL but justregional variations. Computer, blocks, puzzle etc. all have several steps to the signs. But I think kids will be fine. We already know how easily kids pick up new signs and I don't think it will deter them at all. It may just take a little more practice to get those signs down. The sign they show for computer is not what I learned but it actually conceptually makes more sense. So I liked that sign.I also love Marlee Matlin and kids like her from bluesclues. I don't feel she would show us signs that are not true ASL. I do wish they had more kids doing the signs. I think children would be more interested in watching it if lots of different children of different ages were shown. Very small babies can sign and I would like to see that demonstrated.One thing really bothered me as a mom. When the mice go into thebathroom and get cleaned up. They take baths/showers then the blue mouse goes off screen and you hear the toilet flush. Then he walks right by the sink and does not wash his hands. Hopefully kids won't notice that bad example but I bet some will. Overall a fairly good show but it could be much better with some changes. There are much better signing videos out there.",3,Signing is always a good thing,1122076800,"07 23, 2005",2005,2307,"['two', 'cents', 'new', 'DVD', 'little', 'one', 'just', 'turned', 'three', 'have', ""n't"", 'bought', 'new', 'BE', 'shows', 'while', 'wanted', 'one', 'signing', 'child', 'been', 'learning', 'American', 'sign', 'language', 'was', 'only', 'few', 'months', 'old', 'signing', 'shows', 'show', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'good', 'other', 'shows', 'have', 'seen', 'feature', 'signing', 'still', '16.00', 'spent', 'sale', 'Target', 'Cameron', 'favorite', 'new', 'sign', 'mirror', 'learned', 'watching', 'show', 'once', 'been', 'doing', 'when', 'bathroom', 'can', 'watch', 'mirror.The', 'BE', 'shows', 'are', 'so', 'popular', 'may', 'get', 'new', 'people', 'interested', 'signing', 'little', 'ones', 'So', 'when', 'decide', 'want', 'learn', 'more', 'will', 'search', 'find', 'other', 'signing', 'products', 'will', 'be', 'more', 'helpful', 'Hint', 'Hint', 'do', 'internet', 'search', 'will', 'find', 'excellent', 'series', 'signing', 'videos', 'children', 'kids', 'will', 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'fast', 'will', 'be', 'amazed.The', 'signs', 'use', 'are', 'sometimes', 'difficult', 'already', 'beenmentioned', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'were', 'wrong', 'not', 'ASL', 'justregional', 'variations', 'Computer', 'blocks', 'puzzle', 'etc', 'have', 'several', 'steps', 'signs', 'think', 'kids', 'will', 'be', 'fine', 'already', 'know', 'how', 'easily', 'kids', 'pick', 'up', 'new', 'signs', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'deter', 'may', 'just', 'take', 'little', 'more', 'practice', 'get', 'signs', 'down', 'sign', 'show', 'computer', 'not', 'what', 'learned', 'actually', 'conceptually', 'more', 'sense', 'So', 'liked', 'sign.I', 'also', 'love', 'Marlee', 'Matlin', 'kids', 'bluesclues', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'would', 'show', 'signs', 'are', 'not', 'true', 'ASL', 'do', 'wish', 'had', 'more', 'kids', 'doing', 'signs', 'think', 'children', 'would', 'be', 'more', 'interested', 'watching', 'lots', 'different', 'children', 'different', 'ages', 'were', 'shown', 'Very', 'small', 'babies', 'can', 'sign', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'demonstrated.One', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'mom', 'When', 'mice', 'go', 'thebathroom', 'get', 'cleaned', 'up', 'take', 'baths/showers', 'then', 'blue', 'mouse', 'screen', 'hear', 'toilet', 'flush', 'Then', 'walks', 'right', 'sink', 'not', 'wash', 'hands', 'Hopefully', 'kids', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'bad', 'example', 'bet', 'will', 'Overall', 'fairly', 'good', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'changes', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'signing', 'videos', 'there']",N/A

I was excited that they finally came out with one that has signing in it. My son is two, and has been hearing impaired since birth. He wears hearing aids, and is doing very well. He knows over 230 signs and verbalizes well. I was so glad that this DVD was made. We don't do ASL, we do SEE (Signing Exact English). However, whenever they would use signs that weren't SEE, we just show him the right ones that we use, especially when they use really weird complicated ones like ""blocks"" and ""puzzle."" My son's speech therapist and I were especially surprised at those two signs, because they chose to use such complicated ones. Other than that, (and the fact that they did signs for all rooms except the bathroom) the DVD is great.The only other complaint I have is that I was hoping to see hearing impaired kids featured in the DVD and signing as well. It would have been nice to see other little kids with hearing aids signing with the others. That's not all though. Kids need to know that everyone is important. They need to see more ""special"" kids with the attention on them for a change. These children are such special gifts. The kids labeled as ""different"" means something much much more than that. They are ""different"" because God chose to make them more special. These are the kids that teach US and bless US beyond anything we can imagine, and the fact that more people and children don't get to experience the blessings that these special individuals have to share is a shame. I can only pray that as the world becomes more interested in signing, they become more compassionate and interested in the PEOPLE, and not just the signing ""trend.""",4,FINALLY!!

As usual the narrator says the words and you rarely if ever see kids talking. Some of the signs are multiple steps and may be too hard for kids under 3. Some of the words are long, like ""telephone"" (could have shortened to ""phone"") and ""computer"". Most of the words are fairly common and easy to say though like ""bed"" and ""blanket"".

He's seen Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and the Dr. Doolittle vids but thus far he's been really intrigued on all levels with this one only; I believe that's because he likes Matlin doing the signing and the many times children are on screen. The music in it is actually quite good for being, well, not hardcore orchestra as far as orchestras go. It also keeps me from wanting to rip my hair out from listening to it too much since, as I stated before, it can sometimes be the only that keeps him calm and distracted from the pains of teething.
