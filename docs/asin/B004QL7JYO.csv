1424236,A3F2VVIQIY6U64,B004QL7JYO,Armando N. Roman,"[3, 3]","Usually when a relationship is on the rocks, sleeping on the couch is the least of your worries. Some people get locked out of their homes, others are left with no car, the list goes on. Will Ferrell's character, Nick, has a little bit more than that. Everything Must Go is a drama/comedy that's sure to connect with many viewers for being a pretty realistic movie about the end of one chapter in your life and stating a new one. For anyone who's gone through divorce or come close to it, no matter how different your life may be, the character of Nick is still easy to relate to. I'll be honest- I can't stand 90% of Will Ferrell's movies or sketches from SNL. The whole man-child thing never won me over, and it wasn't until 2 years ago when I finally watched Elf that I eased up on him. His performance in Everything Must Go, while nothing worthy of a Best Actor nomination, is still one of the better performances I've seen in a while, if only because of how he handles himself given the situation.Nick works for a major corporation in the sales department, but is suddenly let go because of his alcoholism and a case with a female employee that went the legal route. Upon his termination, he's given a Swiss Army knife (ooh!) with his name on it for all his years of hard work for the company. Before he leaves the parking lot, Nick stabs a tire on the car belonging to the guy who fired him to get a little relief. Unfortunately, he's unable to get the knife out and hightails it outta there. When he gets home, all of his stuff is on the front lawn. The recliner, dresser, rotisserie oven, record player...everything is just sitting out there. That's not all though. The locks have been changed, his cell phone has been deactivated, his bank account (shared with his wife) has a hold on it, and he's without a car. Nick's wife left him a nasty note about his drinking, and how this was the last straw. At first he spends the night on the lawn, absorbing everything that's happened...along with absorbing more alcohol, and after meeting a new neighbor across the street, he suddenly begins to have a yard sale with all his things. He gets some help from a kid who has no one else to talk to or do things with, as his mom takes care of a dying person, and the other kids make fun of him because of his weight. Nick only has 5 days to hold the sale, and after that, he could be arrested if he continues to live on the lawn, as he originally planned, joking or not.What makes the movie work for me is the relationship Nick has with the other two main characters- the kid, Kenny, and his new pregnant neighbor, Samantha. Samantha is living alone until her husband arrives, whenever that may be, and Nick starts things off right with her, helping with moving stuff and introducing himself. As for Kenny, the poor kid says he didn't make the cut for the school baseball team, and wants someone to teach him how to play. He works at the yard sale while learning about how to really make a sale while doing so. It sounds like plain stuff, yet I had fun watching it. Nick's at the end of his rope with no one to help him, and here are two people he's never met before that just happened to come into his life at this moment in time. Isn't that how it is for a lot of us? At first Nick is reluctant to sell anything, turning down offers and saying his recliner isn't for sale. As time goes on, he lets things go easier. It reminded me a little of the growth Art Carney had as Harry in Harry and Tonto- an older man finally growing up and coming to a realization about his life. There's a scene early in the movie where Nick goes to the mini mart to buy some booze and a Slurpee, and as he's exiting, two teenagers offer to buy a few beers from him right there in the parking lot. Later on, Nick's the one begging customers for beer after he doesn't have the money to pay for his own, and the cashier, despite knowing who Nick is from seeing him regularly in the store, doesn't give him a freebie.There's a lot I'd like to talk about to give you more reason to watch Everything Must Go, but I'd be ruining some important scenes. It's not all mopey real life situational drama though- there are some good laughs here and there. The best part is that Ferrell plays it straight. The whole time I was watching, I kept waiting for it. You know what I'm talking about. I kept waiting for him to act goofy and turn into man-child mode, ruining the tone of everything. Luckily, that never happened. Maybe I need to look up his performances to see if he's been in other stuff aside from comedies before this, but Will does a fantastic job playing a mostly-competent character (""mostly"" because hey, he's an alcoholic). I felt bad for him many times and wanted him to figure things out. There's another great scene about 2/3 through the movie that, despite being drunk, Nick delivers some harsh reality to someone about what's really going on with their life.If you're wondering why I didn't give it 5 stars, I'll tell you right now it's because of the ending. And even then, I'd give the movie 4.5 stars if I could. Skip this section though because I'm going to explain why, so here's your spoiler warning! Alright, ready? The movie has an open ending. When all's said and done, and the sale is over, Nick gives the last of what didn't sell away to a few neighbors, and gets a picture that Samantha took of him. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and goes back home as he stands there in the street. Credits roll. Now look, I don't hate it when a movie doesn't give a real ending. I liked how some greats like No Country For Old Men and There Will Be Blood ended! But here...why can't we at least see what Nick had planned? There's really no plan for the guy that we know of. He doesn't have another home ready. He's still out of a job. I mean, I was worried about the guy still! It's not a terrible way to end the movie by any means, I just wanted a bit more resolution. That's just me though.There aren't that many movies I've seen over the last couple of years that I'd be up for watching again. Everything Must Go definitely surprised me with the story and acting, and not taking the easy way out to help the main character. And you know what else? It doesn't have any parts that drag on, and it's a pretty short movie!

It certainly wasn't what I expected with Will Ferrell, unquestionably one of the funniest men around in the lead role you can't help but expect a lot of laughs and silliness ahead. But my initial assumptions couldn't have been further from the truth. Yes, if there's an actor alive who could get laughs out of a storyline revolving around a stressed out, overworked alcoholic getting kicked out of his house, divorced by his wife and forced to temporarily life on the front lawn with what remains of his earthly possessions then Will Ferrell is the man who could do it. In fact you keep waiting for him to suddenly change things up and act crazy but it never happens.Ultimately that may be the genius of the film, you don't get what you expect and yet you embrace it anyway.

1424245,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B004QL7JYO,C. Sawin,"[21, 29]","I've always considered Will Ferrell's work to be somewhat of a guilty pleasure. Complaints of his comedy being stupid, childish and ridiculously over the top are completely justified, but most of it has still been relatively entertaining. His cameos are usually a bit stronger since they're right to the point and aren't force-fed to you like some of his leading roles, but films like Old School and Anchorman will always hold a special place in my heart for the kid in me that loves that nonsensical form of comedy. The few times Ferrell has ventured off into more serious territory have been pleasantly surprising. Stranger Than Fiction is probably the best example. While Ferrell's performance in the Marc Forster directed comedic drama was one of his best and the film had moments of brilliance, but it wasn't quite able to push itself into exceptionally memorable territory. Unfortunately, Everything Must Go is along the same lines.Nick Halsey (Ferrell) is having the worst day anyone could possibly have. He loses his well-paying job of 16 years and falls off the wagon after being sober for six months. Upon returning home, he finds all of the locks and gate codes changed, a letter from his wife telling him that it's over, and all of his belongings sitting on the front lawn. If that wasn't bad enough, Nick's credit cards no longer work and he's blocked from using his joint bank account. He becomes overly possessive of, ""his stuff,"" and has no plans of ever leaving his front lawn. Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pe&ntilde;a), who is also Nick's AA sponsor, eventually steps in and informs Nick that a yard sale could buy him a few days before he'd eventually have to take Nick to jail. With the help of a neighborhood kid named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) whose mom is never around and a pregnant woman who just moved across the street named Samantha (Rebecca Hall), Nick eventually learns the meaning of letting go and moving on with his life.There's a good film lying within the inner depths of Everything Must Go, but all of the decent aspects of the film feel underdeveloped and don't really have the chance to really blossom into strong characteristics or qualities to make the film great. The humor in the film is incredibly dry. Everything Must Go has a slight Lars and the Real Girl kind of feel to it without the awkwardness or strong performances to make it memorable. There are brief moments that attempt to tug at your heart strings, but it's like it all lacks follow-through. All the right elements are there, but just aren't utilized to their full potential. Most of the performances feel kind of bland. Both Will Ferrell and Rebecca Hall show shades of actually being able to portray some emotion, but just when something starts feeling like it's building to a memorable scene they fall back into ho-hum territory.Everything Must Go isn't a happy film in the least. Nick Halsey literally has the worst week anyone could possibly imagine and just when things start to look up, he gets hit with something else. I guess the film is trying to tell you to take everything in stride, one step at a time, just deal with what life throws at you the best you can, ends lead to new beginnings, but it kind of felt like there wasn't the proper balance of hope as well. There are a few notions made that seem to hint at Nick making it through this and being a better person in the long run, but the journey in the meantime will probably leave you feeling pretty depressed.Everything Must Go is a decent comedic drama that offers mediocrity from all sides. The most interesting aspect of the film is its premise, which the film is never fully able to capitalize on. The humor provided is more of the chuckling lightly variety instead of actually laughing out loud and everyone in the film seems to pretty much be playing the same character that's incapable of showing the actual spectrum of emotions. Everything Must Go is fairly disappointing at the end of the day, but not necessarily overly good or bad in the long run.",3,A mediocre film lacking the key ingredients to make it memorable,1305331200,"05 14, 2011",2011,4046,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'considered', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'work', 'be', 'somewhat', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'Complaints', 'comedy', 'being', 'stupid', 'childish', 'ridiculously', 'top', 'are', 'completely', 'justified', 'most', 'still', 'been', 'relatively', 'entertaining', 'cameos', 'are', 'usually', 'bit', 'stronger', ""'re"", 'right', 'point', 'are', ""n't"", 'force-fed', 'leading', 'roles', 'films', 'Old', 'School', 'Anchorman', 'will', 'always', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'kid', 'nonsensical', 'form', 'comedy', 'few', 'times', 'Ferrell', 'ventured', 'off', 'more', 'serious', 'territory', 'have', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprising', 'Stranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'probably', 'best', 'example', 'Ferrell', 'performance', 'Marc', 'Forster', 'directed', 'comedic', 'drama', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'film', 'had', 'moments', 'brilliance', 'was', ""n't"", 'quite', 'able', 'push', 'exceptionally', 'memorable', 'territory', 'Unfortunately', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'along', 'same', 'lines.Nick', 'Halsey', 'Ferrell', 'having', 'worst', 'day', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'have', 'well-paying', 'job', '16', 'years', 'off', 'wagon', 'being', 'sober', 'six', 'months', 'returning', 'home', 'locks', 'gate', 'codes', 'changed', 'letter', 'wife', 'telling', 'belongings', 'sitting', 'front', 'lawn', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'Nick', 'credit', 'cards', 'no', 'longer', 'work', 'blocked', 'using', 'joint', 'bank', 'account', 'overly', 'possessive', 'stuff', 'plans', 'ever', 'leaving', 'front', 'lawn', 'Detective', 'Frank', 'Garcia', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'who', 'also', 'Nick', 'AA', 'sponsor', 'eventually', 'steps', 'informs', 'Nick', 'yard', 'sale', 'could', 'buy', 'few', 'days', ""'d"", 'eventually', 'have', 'take', 'Nick', 'jail', 'help', 'neighborhood', 'kid', 'named', 'Kenny', 'Christopher', 'Jordan', 'Wallace', 'mom', 'never', 'around', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'who', 'just', 'moved', 'street', 'named', 'Samantha', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'Nick', 'eventually', 'meaning', 'letting', 'go', 'moving', 'good', 'film', 'lying', 'inner', 'depths', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'decent', 'aspects', 'film', 'feel', 'underdeveloped', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'chance', 'really', 'blossom', 'strong', 'characteristics', 'qualities', 'make', 'film', 'great', 'humor', 'film', 'incredibly', 'dry', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'slight', 'Lars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'kind', 'feel', 'awkwardness', 'strong', 'performances', 'make', 'memorable', 'are', 'brief', 'moments', 'attempt', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'follow-through', 'right', 'elements', 'are', 'there', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'utilized', 'full', 'potential', 'Most', 'performances', 'feel', 'kind', 'bland', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'show', 'shades', 'actually', 'being', 'able', 'portray', 'emotion', 'just', 'when', 'something', 'feeling', 'building', 'memorable', 'scene', 'fall', 'back', 'ho-hum', 'territory.Everything', 'Must', 'Go', ""n't"", 'happy', 'film', 'least', 'Nick', 'Halsey', 'literally', 'worst', 'week', 'anyone', 'could', 'possibly', 'imagine', 'just', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'look', 'up', 'hit', 'something', 'else', 'guess', 'film', 'trying', 'tell', 'take', 'everything', 'stride', 'one', 'step', 'time', 'just', 'deal', 'what', 'life', 'best', 'can', 'lead', 'new', 'beginnings', 'kind', 'felt', 'was', ""n't"", 'proper', 'balance', 'hope', 'well', 'are', 'few', 'notions', 'made', 'seem', 'hint', 'Nick', 'making', 'being', 'better', 'person', 'long', 'run', 'journey', 'meantime', 'will', 'probably', 'leave', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'depressed.Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'decent', 'comedic', 'drama', 'mediocrity', 'sides', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspect', 'film', 'premise', 'film', 'never', 'fully', 'able', 'capitalize', 'humor', 'provided', 'more', 'chuckling', 'lightly', 'variety', 'instead', 'actually', 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'everyone', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'be', 'playing', 'same', 'character', 'incapable', 'showing', 'actual', 'spectrum', 'emotions', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'fairly', 'disappointing', 'end', 'day', 'not', 'necessarily', 'overly', 'good', 'bad', 'long', 'run']",N/A

His AA sponsor (Michael Pena) tells him he has to hold a yard sale or go to jail.  Begrudgingly Nick conducts the sale with the help of a wise beyond his years neighborhood kid(Christopher C.J.

1424271,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B004QL7JYO,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[1, 2]","Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) is an alcoholic, but not of the flamboyant, fun-loving kind found in movies. Nick is simply a well-meaning, nice guy who just can't bring himself to stop drinking. Within only a few short hours, Nick loses everything because of alcoholism; first, he's fired from the job he's held for sixteen years, then he arrives home to find all of his belongings in the front yard. His wife has left him, changing the locks before her departure as well as cancelling his credit cards and turning off his cellphone service. If that's not enough, his former company repossesses his car as well. Nick is aware that he has hit rock bottom, but can think of nothing else to do except sit in his yard, in his reclining chair, and drink. Eventually, he attempts to better himself and begins by selling the belongings in his yard.Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Everything Must Go is so low-key and character-driven it could have been based on a stage play. Once Nick arrives home in the opening scenes, there's rarely a significant change of scenery with most scenes emphasizing character interaction rather than any type of narrative flow. While sitting on his lawn, Nick is harassed by the cops, but his A.A. sponsor Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) gets them off his back. Nick also befriends Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace, son of the late Notorious B.I.G.), a neighborhood boy, who helps Nick sell his stuff. There's also the new neighbor (Rebecca Hall) across the street who feels sorry for Nick, although is preoccupied with her own life.The weight of the film falls squarely onto the shoulders of the actors, yet none of the performances are showy. No one is going to win an Oscar for their performance, although they're all stellar in a subtle way. Ferrell has cautiously approached dramatic fare before, but, without showing off, he really gets to stretch his acting chops here. Ferrell doesn't yell, overact, or have any type of violent outburst at any point. His performance is firmly grounded in reality, avoiding any and all of the wild antics that generally accompany cinematic alcoholics. He's good at playing a serious man and Nick is so normal that Ferrell effectively conveys an everyman persona that makes him easy to empathize with. From previous performances, I knew Ferrell could handle drama but he demonstrates unexpected depth here.Meanwhile, Wallace is a very natural young actor and his character actually has a purpose in the story, rather than just appearing at the will of the script to help the protagonist. Pe&ntilde;a, who has appeared in several comedies over the last few years, has a welcome return to form in a dramatic role. I've grown used to seeing him with an over-the-top accent rather than utilizing his gift for drama that he used to make his name in Crash. All of the actors make an impression when they appear. Laura Dern has one scene in the film, as a former high-school classmate of Nick's, and it's one of the strongest performances in the film.Everything Must Go is not likeStranger Than Fiction, Ferrell's previous foray into drama. That film had a comedic tone that made it more accessible to Ferrell's typical fanbase. Don't expect much of the comedic nature from this. There are bits of downbeat comedy, but none of it is in a laugh-out-loud sort of way. There is a tone of optimism that runs through the film and a kind of natural humor that comes from the characters, but this is very much a straight-forward drama. However, there's not much dramatic conflict in the film as all the characters are generally well-meaning. It's well-handled drama, but it's as low-key as the characters that inhabit it. There's not much plot to talk about, but there is a twist late in the film that initially seems contrived, but ends up being well-handled and mostly true-to-life. What's most frustrating is that Everything Must Go walks a fine line between heavy and light drama. It's a melancholy film for sure, but it never settles on a specific tone. Even more frustrating is that it doesn't really give the characters the emotional payoff they deserve and just wraps up quickly with as little trouble as possible.Everything Must Go has some good performances that are so calm they're the cinematic equivalent of whispering. In this respect, the performances are responsible for the makeup of the entire film, which is very calm and unassuming. Unfortunately, the film is so calm and low-key that it never becomes particularly memorable and it's highly unlikely anyone will be compelled to give it a second viewing. It's a melancholy journey that moves with emotion rather than narrative and does so almost completely in neutral.GRADE: B-",4,"3 1/2 Stars: Strong Performances in a Low-Key, Unmemorable Film",1314144000,"08 24, 2011",2011,4717,"['Nick', 'Halsey', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'alcoholic', 'not', 'flamboyant', 'fun-loving', 'kind', 'found', 'movies', 'Nick', 'simply', 'well-meaning', 'nice', 'guy', 'who', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'bring', 'stop', 'drinking', 'only', 'few', 'short', 'hours', 'Nick', 'everything', 'alcoholism', 'first', 'fired', 'job', 'held', 'sixteen', 'years', 'then', 'home', 'find', 'belongings', 'front', 'yard', 'wife', 'left', 'changing', 'locks', 'departure', 'as', 'well', 'cancelling', 'credit', 'cards', 'turning', 'off', 'cellphone', 'service', 'not', 'enough', 'former', 'company', 'car', 'as', 'well', 'Nick', 'aware', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'can', 'think', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'sit', 'yard', 'reclining', 'chair', 'drink', 'Eventually', 'better', 'begins', 'selling', 'belongings', 'yard.Based', 'short', 'story', 'Raymond', 'Carver', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'so', 'low-key', 'character-driven', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'based', 'stage', 'play', 'Once', 'Nick', 'home', 'opening', 'scenes', 'rarely', 'significant', 'change', 'scenery', 'most', 'scenes', 'emphasizing', 'character', 'interaction', 'rather', 'type', 'narrative', 'flow', 'sitting', 'lawn', 'Nick', 'harassed', 'cops', 'A.A.', 'sponsor', 'Detective', 'Frank', 'Garcia', 'Michael', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'off', 'back', 'Nick', 'also', 'Kenny', 'Christopher', 'Jordan', 'Wallace', 'son', 'late', 'Notorious', 'B.I.G', 'neighborhood', 'boy', 'who', 'Nick', 'sell', 'stuff', 'also', 'new', 'neighbor', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'street', 'who', 'sorry', 'Nick', 'preoccupied', 'own', 'life.The', 'weight', 'film', 'squarely', 'shoulders', 'actors', 'yet', 'none', 'performances', 'are', 'showy', 'one', 'going', 'win', 'Oscar', 'performance', ""'re"", 'stellar', 'subtle', 'way', 'Ferrell', 'cautiously', 'approached', 'dramatic', 'fare', 'showing', 'off', 'really', 'stretch', 'acting', 'chops', 'here', 'Ferrell', ""n't"", 'yell', 'overact', 'have', 'type', 'violent', 'outburst', 'point', 'performance', 'firmly', 'grounded', 'reality', 'avoiding', 'wild', 'antics', 'generally', 'accompany', 'cinematic', 'alcoholics', 'good', 'playing', 'serious', 'man', 'Nick', 'so', 'normal', 'Ferrell', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'everyman', 'persona', 'easy', 'empathize', 'previous', 'performances', 'knew', 'Ferrell', 'could', 'handle', 'drama', 'unexpected', 'depth', 'here.Meanwhile', 'Wallace', 'very', 'natural', 'young', 'actor', 'character', 'actually', 'purpose', 'story', 'rather', 'just', 'appearing', 'will', 'script', 'help', 'protagonist', 'Pe', 'ntilde', 'who', 'appeared', 'several', 'comedies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'welcome', 'return', 'form', 'dramatic', 'role', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'used', 'seeing', 'over-the-top', 'accent', 'rather', 'utilizing', 'gift', 'drama', 'used', 'make', 'name', 'Crash', 'actors', 'make', 'impression', 'when', 'appear', 'Laura', 'Dern', 'one', 'scene', 'film', 'former', 'high-school', 'classmate', 'Nick', 'one', 'strongest', 'performances', 'film.Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'not', 'likeStranger', 'Than', 'Fiction', 'Ferrell', 'previous', 'foray', 'drama', 'film', 'had', 'comedic', 'tone', 'made', 'more', 'accessible', 'Ferrell', 'typical', 'fanbase', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'much', 'comedic', 'nature', 'are', 'bits', 'downbeat', 'comedy', 'none', 'laugh-out-loud', 'sort', 'way', 'tone', 'optimism', 'film', 'kind', 'natural', 'humor', 'characters', 'very', 'much', 'straight-forward', 'drama', 'However', 'not', 'much', 'dramatic', 'conflict', 'film', 'characters', 'are', 'generally', 'well-meaning', 'well-handled', 'drama', 'as', 'low-key', 'characters', 'inhabit', 'not', 'much', 'plot', 'talk', 'twist', 'late', 'film', 'initially', 'contrived', 'up', 'being', 'well-handled', 'mostly', 'true-to-life', 'What', 'most', 'frustrating', 'Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'fine', 'line', 'heavy', 'light', 'drama', 'melancholy', 'film', 'sure', 'never', 'specific', 'tone', 'Even', 'more', 'frustrating', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'characters', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'deserve', 'just', 'wraps', 'up', 'quickly', 'as', 'little', 'trouble', 'possible.Everything', 'Must', 'Go', 'good', 'performances', 'are', 'so', 'calm', ""'re"", 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'whispering', 'respect', 'performances', 'are', 'responsible', 'makeup', 'entire', 'film', 'very', 'calm', 'unassuming', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'so', 'calm', 'low-key', 'never', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'anyone', 'will', 'be', 'compelled', 'give', 'second', 'viewing', 'melancholy', 'journey', 'emotion', 'rather', 'narrative', 'so', 'almost', 'completely', 'neutral.GRADE', 'B-']",N/A

In fact, I am tired of Vampires, Wall Street Dramas, The Apocalypse told in error and raunchy stories, which operate out of the belief that the greater the frequency of the F word, the drunkenness and drugs, the more is hilarious the movie.Ferrell plays Nick, an alcoholic with amazing aplomb.  His behaviors particularly, his anger, denial and stubbornness demonstrate a man, who is stuck believing that telling same old lies and using manipulation will maintain the status quo.  When it doesn't he remains unyielding but a neighbor boy's own situation helps him to see that life isn't all about Nick. When he and the neighbor boy, Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) start to bond, each learns valuable life lessons.  It is through the young man, Nick realizes that he must change and start being responsible.  It reminded me of similar stories where the student becomes the teacher, but it is not insulting.

1424277,A3KDVSFMPMXSRO,B004QL7JYO,Kevin F. Tasker,"[2, 3]","Will Ferrell can be a tad over-dramatic and zany for many people aside from the vast contingency of teenage boys who undoubtably helped rocket him to the zenith of modern American comedium. His forays into serious film have been scattershot and largely unappealing; Adam Rapp's 2005 Winter's Passing was decidedly morose, Ferrell providing the only spark in a dreary and forgettable landscape. There was, in performances such as that film, however, a rare display of pathos and energy not derived from slapstick or other lower common denominator humor--and an indication that with the right material, Ferrell would be able to really illuminate the screen. Apparently, Raymond Carver's very, very short story Why Don't You Dance? struck the right chord.Though the story itself does not appear on screen, its frame is the same. A man is locked out of his house by his vindictive wife after losing his job and perhaps drinking a little more than he should have...in fact, a lot more than he should have. And he continues to drink, and linger on his lawn. Contrivances such as an AA buddy/police detective who keys Ferrell into a caveat in Arizona law where one may maintain a yard sale for 5 days extends the running time of his malaise-ridden, home-bound venture. A young boy offers companionship, a pregnant married neighbor offers hope and empathy and Stephen Root pops up now and then as a well-to-do scumbag with...shall we say...delicate predilections. The film then, is a deconstruction of a relapsing alcoholic falling and falling, analyzing his life as it was. He states to his neighbor, ""I'm just like you people, but I don't hide [my foibles]."" The film is most interesting as it dissects the facades of modern suburbia. In that way, Carver would have been proud. These are flawed people attempting to survive, to define themselves. Ferrell is both poignant and subdued. He does not over-act in a single frame.One small complaint was the level of product placement in the film. Pabst Blue Ribbon must have made a killing as their familiar glinting silver cans occupy a massive amount of screen-time, moreso than any beer in recent memory. Though this obviously adds a degree of realism, it is frankly distracting as we watch Ferrell lift PBR after PBR to his mouth. Oddly, his use of alcohol would not exactly seem a winning endorsement. It is hard to imagine anyone watching this film, thinking, ""Gee I'd go for a nice cold beer right about now.""Otherwise, the film is both an effective exploration of alcoholism and its effects, a satirical look at suburban life, and a rousing character study anchored by a superb performance from a man whose abilities were once relegated to performing loud-mouth tricks. It is as though Ron Burgundy has grown up, replaced his scotchy-scotch-scotch with warm PBR and a conscience, a soul, a reason to continue living.",4,"Though the actual story is only on screen in spirit, Ferrell's performance is a revelation",1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,2863,"['Will', 'Ferrell', 'can', 'be', 'tad', 'over-dramatic', 'zany', 'many', 'people', 'aside', 'vast', 'contingency', 'teenage', 'boys', 'who', 'undoubtably', 'helped', 'rocket', 'zenith', 'modern', 'American', 'comedium', 'forays', 'serious', 'film', 'have', 'been', 'scattershot', 'largely', 'unappealing', 'Adam', 'Rapp', '2005', 'Winter', 'Passing', 'was', 'decidedly', 'morose', 'Ferrell', 'providing', 'only', 'spark', 'dreary', 'forgettable', 'landscape', 'was', 'performances', 'such', 'film', 'however', 'rare', 'display', 'pathos', 'energy', 'not', 'derived', 'slapstick', 'other', 'lower', 'common', 'denominator', 'humor', 'indication', 'right', 'material', 'Ferrell', 'would', 'be', 'able', 'really', 'illuminate', 'screen', 'Apparently', 'Raymond', 'Carver', 'very', 'very', 'short', 'story', 'Why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dance', 'struck', 'right', 'chord.Though', 'story', 'not', 'appear', 'screen', 'frame', 'same', 'man', 'locked', 'house', 'vindictive', 'wife', 'losing', 'job', 'perhaps', 'drinking', 'little', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'fact', 'lot', 'more', 'should', 'have', 'drink', 'linger', 'lawn', 'Contrivances', 'such', 'AA', 'buddy/police', 'detective', 'who', 'Ferrell', 'caveat', 'Arizona', 'law', 'where', 'one', 'may', 'maintain', 'yard', 'sale', '5', 'days', 'running', 'time', 'malaise-ridden', 'home-bound', 'venture', 'young', 'boy', 'offers', 'companionship', 'pregnant', 'married', 'neighbor', 'offers', 'hope', 'empathy', 'Stephen', 'Root', 'up', 'now', 'then', 'well-to-do', 'scumbag', 'shall', 'say', 'delicate', 'predilections', 'film', 'then', 'deconstruction', 'relapsing', 'alcoholic', 'falling', 'falling', 'analyzing', 'life', 'was', 'neighbor', ""'m"", 'just', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', '[', 'foibles', ']', 'film', 'most', 'interesting', 'facades', 'modern', 'suburbia', 'way', 'Carver', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'proud', 'are', 'flawed', 'people', 'attempting', 'survive', 'define', 'Ferrell', 'poignant', 'subdued', 'not', 'over-act', 'single', 'frame.One', 'small', 'complaint', 'was', 'level', 'product', 'placement', 'film', 'Pabst', 'Blue', 'Ribbon', 'must', 'have', 'made', 'killing', 'familiar', 'glinting', 'silver', 'cans', 'occupy', 'massive', 'amount', 'screen-time', 'moreso', 'beer', 'recent', 'memory', 'obviously', 'degree', 'realism', 'frankly', 'distracting', 'watch', 'Ferrell', 'lift', 'PBR', 'PBR', 'mouth', 'Oddly', 'use', 'alcohol', 'would', 'not', 'exactly', 'seem', 'winning', 'endorsement', 'hard', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'watching', 'film', 'thinking', 'Gee', ""'d"", 'go', 'nice', 'cold', 'beer', 'right', 'now', 'Otherwise', 'film', 'effective', 'exploration', 'alcoholism', 'effects', 'satirical', 'look', 'suburban', 'life', 'rousing', 'character', 'study', 'anchored', 'superb', 'performance', 'man', 'abilities', 'were', 'once', 'relegated', 'performing', 'loud-mouth', 'tricks', 'Ron', 'Burgundy', 'grown', 'up', 'replaced', 'scotchy-scotch-scotch', 'warm', 'PBR', 'conscience', 'soul', 'reason', 'continue', 'living']",N/A

Everytime I read the story, I get the easy, and I think obvious, inference that the protagonist's wife has simply up-and-left, and the story does in fact explicitly state that it was the protagonist himself who has decided to bring all his stuff out onto the front yard. I believe this is a CRUCIAL element to the story that has to be there in order for the story to work. Why they didn't construct the movie this way is beyond me, because it undermines the title of the movie, at least for the first four-fifths of the movie when Ferrell's character is loathe to get rid of anything. If the moviemakers changed this crucial detail for the sake of prolonging the story (which was an admittedly extremely short story, as are nearly all of Carver's stories), then it was a ploy that didn't really work, in my opinion.Whereas in the story, the protagonist had obviously had life destroy all of his hopes and dreams, he was able nevertheless to become a master over it all in a way, by moving his stuff out onto the front yard, by himself, for a huge ""everything must go"" sale, and also to recreate outside what he had had inside, for some sort of nostalgic self-punishment; and he just sort of resigned to it all--he drank of course, but he did not ever become visibly upset. Never. And that, I think, is key. In this film, you see Ferrell being visibly upset for far too long. The film makers needed perhaps to have studied the deadpan reactions of old Buster Keaton films to learn how effective and funny this sort of character can be. This, I think, is the sort of character which seems to always show up in Carver's stories, not the character we see here from Ferrell. Ferrell's character is not funny at all. Neither is the movie.

And with the single exception of 'Stranger Than Fiction' - I've never seen a film where I've enjoyed his particular brand of humor.So I understand how difficult it was for fans of the man to accept him in anything other than a ""Will Ferrell Movie"" - especially given the sideways divergence of this quiet offbeat role. Missing are his trademarks goofy characterizations, dress ups, and spastic comedic routines.In 'Must Go' he plays Nick Halsey, a struggling alcoholic sales manager who has crossed several of Life's symbolic do-not-cross-these-lines-in-the-sand.For starters, he starts drinking - again. And then, in a blackout binge, reportedly engaged in sexual relations with a co-worker who now accuses him of harassment. Finally, for his wife, the final straw in their turbulent marriage; having already endured multiple affairs and multiple trips through rehab, she's leaving him for good.He's hit the trifecta of personal stupidity.After getting the axe, he stops by the local quickie-mart to stock up on beer, and lots of it. Only to reach his residence to discover everything he owns splayed across the front lawn. Trying the doors and gates - all the locks and codes have been changed. In one fell swoop he is unemployed, unemployable, and a homeless drunk. This is turning out to be the worst day of Nick's life. Physically and emotionally drained, with all his worldly goods strewn about, he plops down into his lounge chair and really starts to get blasted.Quickly, the cover of night that hides so much ugliness, turns into day - revealing the pathetic wreck he has become. And his neighbors, who harbor their own odd quirks and secrets, are becoming concerned as Nick doesn't seem to moving in any particular direction, other than to drive to the quickie-mart to pick up more beer. Days pass and he's given a warning by the local police - since he can technically run a 'garage sale' for five days on his property, that's the cut off to pick up his stuff and get moving. Either that or he'll be arrested by the end of the week. That the cop is also his AA Sponsor doesn't make that statement any easier to take.The week he spends out on the lawn is an addict's journey finally hitting bottom. And, as time passes, he unknowingly goes through The Five Stages.Helping him along are two neighbors. A young man whom he would've never met or even acknowledged in the past. Young Kenny, played by CJ Wallace, is himself lost without direction. And in that shared pointlessness the two find friendship and camaraderie. And Rebecca Hill, who plays a pregnant new resident to the neighborhood; a young wife patronized and bullied by her absent long-distance husband.These three make up an offbeat team of sorts. Each with his or her own foibles and fears; each trying to find a new route through Life.It seems that every SNL alum has to try his or her hand at doing a ""serious"" film. But where Bill Murray fell onto his pretentious petard with the remake of 'The Razor's Edge' and Chris Kattan comes off as a pathetic ham-laden drama student in just about everything - I give credit to Ferrell.

Will Ferrell proves his acting ability in this excellent film. This is not a comedy although, like life, it has its comedic moments. This is a story of hitting rock bottom, then starting to make a recovery. There is no Jimmy Stewart-esque happy ending, just as that does not occur in real life. Instead, the story of a man and his weaknesses is told through the the unblinking eyes of the world created by his indiscretions. There is the hint of the start of redemption, but, as in real life, that redemption does not occur in the final 10 minutes.

It IS Will Ferrell after all. But, funny moments aside, this is really more of an avante garde, indie film focusing on alcoholism and dependency. The premise is simple....Ferrell is a top notch salesman who is fired for drinking on the job. He comes home to find all his stuff on the lawn and all the locks in his house are changed. So, what is he gonna do? He doesnt really know, so he just starts living on his lawn, drinking all day and all night. I wont go any further into the story, but this is really a powerful effort in my opinion. The depiction of addiction and dependency is poignant, and the way Ferrell's character deals with everything, leading to him having a few epiphany's and kind of finding himself are very well done. The impact of his decisions on the people around him are also well done.I really enjoyed this movie. It's kind of depressing, kind of hopeful...it is a bit slower paced, and is really both a departure from Ferrell's stock and trade, and a departure from my normal movie preferences as well.

Hunt ""wasabi crush""","[85, 88]","Everything Must Go is a 2011 comedy-drama directed by Dan Rush.Nick Halsey, played by Will Ferrell, comes home after being fired from his job to find that his wife has left him and placed all of his belongings on their front lawn.  She's changed the locks, vacated the home, and has frozen his access to their bank account.  With no car and no money, Nick opts to live with his belongings in the yard.  The film follows his interactions with new friends and neighbors as he works his way through life as rock-bottom alcoholic.I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell.  I've seen a handful of his films and have chuckled here and there, but I'm not really into his style of humor.  I've incrementally moved further away from him with every comedy he's made because of the repetition.  It's disappointing to watch actors get locked into tried-and-true roles and I think Ferrell has most definitely bowed to these demons.  So, when I heard he went after a project like this, I had to support the effort.  It's exciting to watch funny folk swim to the deeper end of the pool and I think he performed wonderfully.I've read through most of the negative reviews garnered by this film and I suspect most people are upset that the Will Ferrell they're used to didn't show up for Everything Must Go.  Which is sad but not surprising.  I think he's amassed a fan base that doesn't particularly care for nor desire any growth in this actor.  He's the funny man.  Funny man need only be funny.Everything Must Go isn't funny but there is humor, albeit a bit darker than his followers were likely prepared for.  I don't think this movie is genius but it is a bit cunning and that's enough for me.  The acting was precise and my mood shifted softly along here and there when and where intended.  I'm glad I got involved.I have in my library a small stack of films set aside as a homage to comedians that tried something different and won.  People like Jim Carrey in, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", Adam Sandler in, ""Punch Drunk Love"", and especially Marlon Wayans in, ""Requiem for a Dream"".  Will Ferrell's, ""Everything Must Go"" should fit right in, here.Thanks for your time.- t",4,"""I'm no different than any of you.

After Nick (Ferrell) gets fired from his job of 16 years he comes home to find his wife has changed the locks on his doors and all of his stuff is on the lawn.  Thinking the best way to fix things is to stay at home Nick begins his new life, living outside.  This is a very very good movie and a very different role for Will Ferrell.  While not quite as good as Adam Sandler in ""Reign Over Me"", Ferrell still shows he has what it takes to be a good dramatic actor.  There are a few funny parts in this but this is not a comedy.  It's a drama with a lot of heart and while the movie is depressing at times it is a joy to watch.  Ferrell does have some funny scenes with his own style of humor that adds to the character and watching him with the actor that plays Kenny is a treat.  This is not a typical Will Ferrell movie, but being a huge fan I loved it and look forward to more roles like this from him.  I highly recommend this.

Despite being a model employee while on the job, he's cost the company money because of his alcoholism and after sixteen years is let go from his job. He comes home to find all of his belongings on the front lawn, the locks on the doors have been changed, and the garage key number altered. His wife has left him, leaving just a note and his stuff behind. His credit cards no longer work and his wife has blocked his access from his account at the bank. After being on the wagon for about six months, he completely falls off and gets drunk on lots and lots of beer. Later, his company car is taken by a repo man even though he was supposed to be able to keep it for a month. It is a really, really bad day. To top it off, at the end of the day, the police show up that night and try to arrest him for drinking and sleeping on his front yawn.His AA sponsor Frank Garcia (Michael Pena) shows up to prevent the arrest. Frank informs Nick the next day that according to city regulations, a yard sale can last a total of three days so he's got three days to get all of his stuff off the lawn. At first, Nick doesn't know what to think or do. However, he ends up hiring a boy in the neighborhood, Kenny Loftus (Christopher Jordan Wallace) to help him make signs, organize his belongs, and sell his stuff. Along the way, Nick develops a friendship with his new neighbor across the street, Samantha (Rebecca Hall), a pregnant woman from New York who has moved to Arizona ahead of her husband.Will Ferrell delivers a great performance as Nick Halsey. Ferrell is known for his comedy, but he's a great dramatic actor. He just doesn't have the opportunity to use those skills very often. If you're looking for a typical Will Ferrell movie, you should stay completely away from EVERYTHING MUST GO. There are comic elements, but this is not a comedy. The way Halsey is written, he's kind of creep. There is an internal rage within that comes out when one least expects it. For most of the movie, Halsey is drunk. He's also kind of a creep as illustrated by his open spying on his neighbors. In the hands of a lesser actor, Nick could easily have been an unlikeable creeper. Instead, Ferrell makes him a person that the audience actually cares about. The rest of the cast also gives solid performances, though I thought Pena's character of Frank Garcia seemed a little underdeveloped. This underdevelopment of Garcia can also be said about the entire movie.EVERYTHING MUST GO is a good little movie with a lot of potential that is never realized. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy smaller, little films. I also enjoy quirky movies and though there are a few oddball things that happen in EVERYTHING MUST GO, it's just not quirky enough. The premise of the movie is taken from Raymond Carver's short story (4 pages) ""Why Don't You Dance"". Carver's stories are often short and usually don't make much sense. EVERYTHING MUST GO is more developed than that story, but it's just not developed enough.The DVD special features include a commentary with writer/director Dan Rush and actor Michael Pena. The commentary is typical and doesn't really provide much new insight, but it does lack the self-congratulations that many DVD commentaries have. There are two short featurettes. One is entitled ""In Character with Will Ferrell"" that features various cast and crew members talking about what it was like to work with Ferrell on a film like this as well as Ferrell talking about his experience doing a project that wasn't a typical ""Will Ferrell"" movie. The other featurette is a behind-the -scenes edited hodge-podge. There are also a few deleted clips and scenes. There are a couple of these scenes that would have made the movie a little stronger, for instance the scene between Nick and the elderly vet next door or the scene where Nick calls a hooker so he can have someone to talk to.  Lastly, there are the usual trailers for other ""upcoming"", ""soon-to-released on DVD"", and ""now on DVD"" movies.",3,"Underdeveloped, But Worth the Time. 3 1/2 stars",1326585600,"01 15, 2012",2012,4044,"['Nick', 'Halsey', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'having', 'incredibly', 'terrible', 'bad', 'day', 'being', 'model', 'employee', 'job', 'cost', 'company', 'money', 'alcoholism', 'sixteen', 'years', 'let', 'go', 'job', 'home', 'find', 'belongings', 'front', 'lawn', 'locks', 'doors', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'garage', 'key', 'number', 'altered', 'wife', 'left', 'leaving', 'just', 'note', 'stuff', 'credit', 'cards', 'no', 'longer', 'work', 'wife', 'blocked', 'access', 'account', 'bank', 'being', 'wagon', 'six', 'months', 'completely', 'drunk', 'lots', 'lots', 'beer', 'Later', 'company', 'car', 'taken', 'repo', 'man', 'even', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'keep', 'month', 'really', 'really', 'bad', 'day', 'top', 'off', 'end', 'day', 'police', 'show', 'up', 'night', 'try', 'arrest', 'drinking', 'sleeping', 'front', 'yawn.His', 'AA', 'sponsor', 'Frank', 'Garcia', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'up', 'prevent', 'arrest', 'Frank', 'Nick', 'next', 'day', 'according', 'city', 'regulations', 'yard', 'sale', 'can', 'last', 'total', 'three', 'days', 'got', 'three', 'days', 'get', 'stuff', 'lawn', 'first', 'Nick', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'do', 'However', 'up', 'hiring', 'boy', 'neighborhood', 'Kenny', 'Loftus', 'Christopher', 'Jordan', 'Wallace', 'help', 'make', 'signs', 'organize', 'belongs', 'sell', 'stuff', 'way', 'Nick', 'friendship', 'new', 'neighbor', 'street', 'Samantha', 'Rebecca', 'Hall', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'New', 'York', 'who', 'moved', 'Arizona', 'ahead', 'husband.Will', 'Ferrell', 'great', 'performance', 'Nick', 'Halsey', 'Ferrell', 'known', 'comedy', 'great', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'opportunity', 'use', 'skills', 'very', 'often', ""'re"", 'looking', 'typical', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'movie', 'should', 'stay', 'completely', 'away', 'EVERYTHING', 'MUST', 'GO', 'are', 'comic', 'elements', 'not', 'comedy', 'way', 'Halsey', 'written', 'kind', 'creep', 'internal', 'rage', 'out', 'when', 'one', 'least', 'most', 'movie', 'Halsey', 'drunk', 'also', 'kind', 'creep', 'illustrated', 'open', 'spying', 'neighbors', 'hands', 'lesser', 'actor', 'Nick', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'unlikeable', 'creeper', 'Instead', 'Ferrell', 'person', 'audience', 'actually', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'solid', 'performances', 'thought', 'Pena', 'character', 'Frank', 'Garcia', 'seemed', 'little', 'underdeveloped', 'underdevelopment', 'Garcia', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'said', 'entire', 'movie.EVERYTHING', 'MUST', 'GO', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'lot', 'potential', 'never', 'realized', 'enjoyed', 'enjoy', 'smaller', 'little', 'films', 'also', 'enjoy', 'quirky', 'movies', 'are', 'few', 'oddball', 'things', 'happen', 'EVERYTHING', 'MUST', 'GO', 'just', 'not', 'quirky', 'enough', 'premise', 'movie', 'taken', 'Raymond', 'Carver', 'short', 'story', '4', 'pages', 'Why', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Dance', 'Carver', 'stories', 'are', 'often', 'short', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'much', 'sense', 'EVERYTHING', 'MUST', 'GO', 'more', 'developed', 'story', 'just', 'not', 'developed', 'enough.The', 'DVD', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'commentary', 'writer/director', 'Dan', 'Rush', 'actor', 'Michael', 'Pena', 'commentary', 'typical', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'much', 'new', 'insight', 'lack', 'self-congratulations', 'many', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'have', 'are', 'two', 'short', 'featurettes', 'One', 'entitled', 'Character', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'various', 'cast', 'crew', 'members', 'talking', 'what', 'was', 'work', 'Ferrell', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'Ferrell', 'talking', 'experience', 'doing', 'project', 'was', ""n't"", 'typical', 'Will', 'Ferrell', 'movie', 'other', 'featurette', 'behind-the', '-scenes', 'edited', 'hodge-podge', 'are', 'also', 'few', 'deleted', 'clips', 'scenes', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'little', 'stronger', 'instance', 'scene', 'Nick', 'elderly', 'vet', 'next', 'door', 'scene', 'where', 'Nick', 'hooker', 'can', 'have', 'someone', 'talk', 'Lastly', 'are', 'usual', 'trailers', 'other', 'upcoming', 'soon-to-released', 'DVD', 'now', 'DVD', 'movies']",N/A

As I type this, there are currently 17 5-star reviews and 17 1-star reviews, and it appears at least part of the reason for the low scores is some of the people were expecting another zany, laugh-a-minute, Will Ferrell comedy (like ""Elf"",""Anchorman"", or ""Talladega Nights"").  And though I did find this movie hilarious in places, it's definitely not your usual type of ""Will Ferrell hilarious"".  The comedy in this movie comes from personal tragedy and poignant little pokes at life and loss.  And Ferrell's wonderful delivery of a man teetering-on-the-edge evokes a bitter-sweet and sympathetic kind of laughter...sometimes having nothing left to lose is quite funny...especially the way it's portrayed by Will Ferrell.So, yes, here you have a guy who has lost his job, his wife, and his self respect, and camping on his front lawn with all his belongings, he's just trying to come to grips with what comes next in his seriously shaken-up life.  Ferrell's performance is subtly comical, and his interaction with a lost and lonely neighborhood kid, Kenny, is priceless.  The kid who plays Kenny delivers the most dead-pan lines, observing and asking questions about Ferrell's train wreck existence in an innocently probing way.  For me, the Kenny and Nick (Ferrell) scenes are the funniest parts, and there is real chemistry and warmth between the two characters.All-in-all, I really enjoyed this movie.  The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5-stars is the movie did seem a little overly crafted at times, like the writer wanted the story to go in a certain direction despite seeming to me the character would have chosen to do something different.SO, to once again manage some expectations, this is NOT a normal crazy, over-the-top, Will Ferrell type of comedy.  It's a ""dramedy"" more or less (a serious but funny-ish movie where the comedy isn't so obvious), and Will Ferrell very effectively plays both sides of that coin in this film. If you don't want to see Will Ferrell play a semi-serious role, you likely don't want to see this movie.
