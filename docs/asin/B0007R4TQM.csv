888567,A1H7OERDUF47DZ,B0007R4TQM,Maximilian,"[0, 0]","Interesting!  For anyone who is curious about near-death experiences, I think this documentary conveys the information quite well.  However, you might find the religious overtone (there's plenty of it) a bit too much if your mind is more open to science rather than a slave to sectarian views.  The reported data and implications are all there; the viewers, of course, have the freedom to arrive at their own interpretations and conclusions on the subject matter.",4,The Search for Heaven (DVD),1328745600,"02 9, 2012",2012,463,"['Interesting', 'anyone', 'who', 'curious', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'think', 'documentary', 'information', 'quite', 'well', 'However', 'might', 'find', 'religious', 'overtone', 'plenty', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'mind', 'more', 'open', 'science', 'rather', 'slave', 'sectarian', 'views', 'reported', 'data', 'implications', 'are', 'there', 'viewers', 'course', 'have', 'freedom', 'arrive', 'own', 'interpretations', 'conclusions', 'subject', 'matter']",The Search for Heaven

888569,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B0007R4TQM,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[0, 0]","I've read most of the main books on near-death experiences which is why this DVD was so interesting to me. It was intriguing to see the stories I've read acted out. It made the stories much more meaningful.I especially enjoyed the story of the woman who leaves her body and sees a red shoe. The red shoe is later retrieved which in some ways proved the experience was real.I found this DVD to be scary, enlightening, funny and at times it left me close to tears. Most of the main near-death experience authors were featured and interviewed.This is not a scientific movie although there are quotes by scientists. It is a much more religious experience and explains a bit about heaven and hell.I'd recommend this to anyone who has any interest in near-death experiences as that seems to be the focus of the documentary.~The Rebecca Review",4,Essential Viewing for Anyone Interested in Near-Death Experiences,1364774400,"04 1, 2013",2013,836,"[""'ve"", 'read', 'most', 'main', 'books', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'why', 'DVD', 'was', 'so', 'interesting', 'was', 'intriguing', 'see', 'stories', ""'ve"", 'read', 'acted', 'out', 'made', 'stories', 'much', 'more', 'meaningful.I', 'especially', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'woman', 'who', 'body', 'red', 'shoe', 'red', 'shoe', 'later', 'retrieved', 'ways', 'proved', 'experience', 'was', 'real.I', 'DVD', 'be', 'scary', 'enlightening', 'funny', 'times', 'left', 'close', 'tears', 'Most', 'main', 'near-death', 'experience', 'authors', 'were', 'featured', 'interviewed.This', 'not', 'scientific', 'movie', 'are', 'quotes', 'scientists', 'much', 'more', 'religious', 'experience', 'bit', 'heaven', 'hell.I', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'interest', 'near-death', 'experiences', 'be', 'focus', 'documentary.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Search for Heaven

Interesting out of body experiences especially clinical death for 28 minutes. Stories are illustrated so you watch story not just listen. I don't recommend watch extras. They are poorly made: repeating of episodes from film and more tendency to religion. But movie itself lives the questions of creation and God are opened for your own opinion. Movie gives the hope of meaning of life.Good narrations, Ok graphic and good background music.",4,It is not hard science but interesting facts...,1253059200,"09 16, 2009",2009,580,"['not', 'hard', 'analysis', 'religious', 'rather', 'surfacing', 'Movie', 'title', 'search', 'not', 'hard', 'proof', 'theories', 'Interesting', 'body', 'experiences', 'especially', 'clinical', 'death', '28', 'minutes', 'Stories', 'are', 'illustrated', 'watch', 'story', 'not', 'just', 'listen', 'do', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'watch', 'extras', 'are', 'poorly', 'made', 'repeating', 'episodes', 'film', 'more', 'tendency', 'religion', 'movie', 'questions', 'creation', 'God', 'are', 'opened', 'own', 'opinion', 'Movie', 'hope', 'meaning', 'life.Good', 'narrations', 'Ok', 'graphic', 'good', 'background', 'music']",The Search for Heaven

Round Trip does not have much on the clinical view, just the near death experiences.  If you prefer just watching the ""experiences"" then Round Trip will be a nice DVD to watch.",4,PRETTY GOOD!,1361577600,"02 23, 2013",2013,304,"['3', '1/2', 'Stars', 'liked', 'DVD', 'better', 'Lazarus', 'Phenomenon', 'also', 'watched', 'Round', 'Trip', 'give', '3', '1/2', 'Stars', 'as', 'well', 'Round', 'Trip', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'clinical', 'view', 'just', 'near', 'death', 'experiences', 'prefer', 'just', 'watching', 'experiences', 'then', 'Round', 'Trip', 'will', 'be', 'nice', 'DVD', 'watch']",The Search for Heaven
