The third season starts to lose some steam and by the time one of the most memorable (and lovable) characters leaves, it just isn't the same.  I cannot say enough about this series-it is smart and hysterically (roll on the floor) funny.

801111,AIYPX432C0P93,B0001DMUEK,Karoly,"[15, 16]","This is a series that makes one wish for the Scottish Highlands.  It is beautifully written, has breathtaking scenery, and it an easy way to spend a few hours.Transporting the viewer into the world of Young Laird MacDonald, and the mishaps that plague him at every turn, it quickly engrosses the viewer into the life and moral struggles he faces as he comes to terms with his unwelcomed birthright.  Although longing for the independent life he has created, he is dedicated to his family, especially his mother, and does his best to rectify the damage done to his family's assets by years of neglectful management by his father.The stories move quickly, and are filled with colorful characters, fast and light humor, and scenery of a beautiful country, which is a supporting character in its own right.  The costuming is fun, the dialogue appropriate for the setting, and the native wildlife interacted with respectfully.  It is sure to be a crowd pleaser, but people who are not familiar with the Scottish brogue or common Scottish slang may have a difficult time with comprehending the supporting characters and their conversations with one another.Monarch of the Glen is appropriate for most general audiences.  There is some mild violence, some inferred mature themes, and some mild oath muttering, but nothing that should be considered offensive to even the most sensitive viewer.  I highly recommend it for anyone who loves a good story, especially those who enjoy the setting of the beautiful Scottish Highlands.",5,Monarch of the Glen--A Rare Treat,1094428800,"09 6, 2004",2004,1519,"['series', 'one', 'wish', 'Scottish', 'Highlands', 'beautifully', 'written', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'easy', 'way', 'spend', 'few', 'hours.Transporting', 'viewer', 'world', 'Young', 'Laird', 'MacDonald', 'mishaps', 'plague', 'turn', 'quickly', 'viewer', 'life', 'moral', 'struggles', 'terms', 'unwelcomed', 'birthright', 'longing', 'independent', 'life', 'created', 'dedicated', 'family', 'especially', 'mother', 'best', 'rectify', 'damage', 'done', 'family', 'assets', 'years', 'neglectful', 'management', 'father.The', 'stories', 'move', 'quickly', 'are', 'filled', 'colorful', 'characters', 'fast', 'light', 'humor', 'scenery', 'beautiful', 'country', 'supporting', 'character', 'own', 'right', 'costuming', 'fun', 'dialogue', 'appropriate', 'setting', 'native', 'wildlife', 'interacted', 'respectfully', 'sure', 'be', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Scottish', 'brogue', 'common', 'Scottish', 'slang', 'may', 'have', 'difficult', 'time', 'comprehending', 'supporting', 'characters', 'conversations', 'one', 'another.Monarch', 'Glen', 'appropriate', 'most', 'general', 'audiences', 'mild', 'violence', 'inferred', 'mature', 'themes', 'mild', 'oath', 'muttering', 'nothing', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'offensive', 'even', 'most', 'sensitive', 'viewer', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'good', 'story', 'especially', 'who', 'enjoy', 'setting', 'beautiful', 'Scottish', 'Highlands']",Monarch of the Glen - The Complete Series 1 & 2
801112,A1ALOEZ4NXHUT,B0001DMUEK,"R.L. Holly ""piper909""","[24, 26]","Monarch of the Glen is an incredibly solid, well-crafted series from BBC Scotland, and the first two seasons are exactly where a newcomer should begin.  Although the individual episodes are self-contained (and usually include multiple storylines), there is a strong continuity among the characters that  requires chronological viewing.  Series one is the slower of the two here, with so many characters to be introduced and established, but the momentum builds and by series two events are really bouncing along at Glenbogle, the fictitious (but built on solid foundations) Highland estate of young Archie MacDonald. And series three and four are even better.Impeccably scripted and performed, MOTG brings us the (mis)adventures and troubled relationships of the MacDonald family of Glenbogle plus their assorted friends, families, retainers, and interlopers.  Each episode lasts less than an hour, but they are so tightly written and fast-paced that you feel you've watched a full-length feature film every time.  This is quality stuff, folks, chock-full of bittersweet romance, generational conflict, the struggle to balance traditional virtues in a modern world, and classic British eccentricity on parade.  Richard Briers and Susan Hampshire are particularly marvelous as the doting (and dotty) Hector and Molly MacDonald, Laird and Lady of Glenbogle, but the show revolves around their son Archie (Alastair Mackenzie) and his pursuit of the woman of his dreams (whoever she may be)  along with  elusive financial solvency for the aging estate.  Each episode brings Archie new challenges on both fronts.  Can he possibly sort out his love life before his parents drive him crazy?  Will Glenbogle again escape the grasping claws of  creditors,  tax-assessors, and meddling politicians?  Will Lord Kilwillie ever manage to boast of the ""Tallest Tree in Scotland"" or make off with Hector's prize cask of single-malt whisky?  The terrific supporting cast and guest stars make this show a treat for any Scot-ophile, and the  scenery will make you want to plan your next vacation in the Highlands. Charming as a day in Brigadoon, without the Clan Bogus kitsch.",5,Top-notch whimsical drama from Scotland,1108080000,"02 11, 2005",2005,2158,"['Monarch', 'Glen', 'incredibly', 'solid', 'well-crafted', 'series', 'BBC', 'Scotland', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'exactly', 'where', 'newcomer', 'should', 'begin', 'individual', 'episodes', 'are', 'self-contained', 'usually', 'include', 'multiple', 'storylines', 'strong', 'continuity', 'characters', 'chronological', 'viewing', 'Series', 'one', 'slower', 'two', 'here', 'so', 'many', 'characters', 'be', 'introduced', 'established', 'momentum', 'builds', 'series', 'two', 'events', 'are', 'really', 'bouncing', 'along', 'Glenbogle', 'fictitious', 'built', 'solid', 'foundations', 'Highland', 'estate', 'young', 'Archie', 'MacDonald', 'series', 'three', 'four', 'are', 'even', 'better.Impeccably', 'scripted', 'performed', 'MOTG', 'mis', 'adventures', 'troubled', 'relationships', 'MacDonald', 'family', 'Glenbogle', 'assorted', 'friends', 'families', 'retainers', 'interlopers', 'episode', 'less', 'hour', 'are', 'so', 'tightly', 'written', 'fast-paced', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'full-length', 'feature', 'film', 'time', 'quality', 'stuff', 'folks', 'chock-full', 'bittersweet', 'romance', 'generational', 'conflict', 'struggle', 'balance', 'traditional', 'virtues', 'modern', 'world', 'classic', 'British', 'eccentricity', 'parade', 'Richard', 'Briers', 'Susan', 'Hampshire', 'are', 'particularly', 'marvelous', 'doting', 'dotty', 'Hector', 'Molly', 'MacDonald', 'Laird', 'Lady', 'Glenbogle', 'show', 'around', 'son', 'Archie', 'Alastair', 'Mackenzie', 'pursuit', 'woman', 'dreams', 'may', 'be', 'elusive', 'financial', 'solvency', 'aging', 'estate', 'episode', 'Archie', 'new', 'challenges', 'fronts', 'Can', 'possibly', 'sort', 'out', 'love', 'life', 'parents', 'drive', 'crazy', 'Will', 'Glenbogle', 'again', 'escape', 'grasping', 'claws', 'creditors', 'tax-assessors', 'meddling', 'politicians', 'Will', 'Lord', 'Kilwillie', 'ever', 'manage', 'boast', 'Tallest', 'Tree', 'Scotland', 'make', 'off', 'Hector', 'prize', 'cask', 'single-malt', 'whisky', 'terrific', 'supporting', 'cast', 'guest', 'stars', 'make', 'show', 'treat', 'Scot-ophile', 'scenery', 'will', 'make', 'want', 'plan', 'next', 'vacation', 'Highlands', 'Charming', 'day', 'Brigadoon', 'Clan', 'Bogus', 'kitsch']",Monarch of the Glen - The Complete Series 1 & 2
