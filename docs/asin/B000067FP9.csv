We have 4 DVD sets and a few VHS's.If you're unfamiliar with the premise, the central characters are Ms. Frizzle (a teacher), her class, Liz the lizard and the Bus. Ms. Frizzle takes her class on crazy field trips, where Bus--and sometimes the kids!--experience a transformation so they can get closer to the action. (For example, become a bee or turning into water droplets.)One of our most recent purchases was Creepy, Crawly Fun! and it's excellent as always. These three episodes are:*Inside the Haunted House - Acoustics and hearing*Going Batty - Nocturnal creatures and echolocation*Spins a Web - The life of spidersThere is also a few interactive and DVD-ROM features, by my son hasn't used those.This CD runs about 90 minutes and is supposedly geared towards children 3-8. Personally, I think the age-appropriate range is more like 6-10 because of the complex concepts introduced.However, if younger kids enjoy it--more power to them! It certainly can't hurt to introduce science to younger kids if the Magic School Bus holds their interest.My 8-year old son really enjoys the series now (he didn't get into it when he was younger), so I use the Magic School Bus series to supplement our learning/experimenting with science principles. And, my son seems to love Creepy, Crawly Fun--especially where Ms. Frizzle's voice is distorted!Also, this would be a great DVD for Halloween time--especially since it's educational!",5,"Bats, Spiders and Haunted Houses (Oh My!)",1181260800,"06 8, 2007",2007,1526,"['homeschool', 'unschool', 'son', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'series', 'GREAT', 'teaching', 'kids', 'science', 'have', '4', 'DVD', 'sets', 'few', ""VHS's.If"", ""'re"", 'unfamiliar', 'premise', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'teacher', 'class', 'Liz', 'lizard', 'Bus', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'class', 'crazy', 'field', 'trips', 'where', 'Bus', 'sometimes', 'kids', 'experience', 'transformation', 'can', 'get', 'closer', 'action', 'example', 'become', 'bee', 'turning', 'water', 'droplets', 'One', 'most', 'recent', 'purchases', 'was', 'Creepy', 'Crawly', 'Fun', 'excellent', 'always', 'three', 'episodes', 'are', 'Haunted', 'House', 'Acoustics', 'hearing*Going', 'Batty', 'Nocturnal', 'creatures', 'Web', 'life', 'spidersThere', 'also', 'few', 'interactive', 'DVD-ROM', 'features', 'son', ""n't"", 'used', 'those.This', 'CD', 'runs', '90', 'minutes', 'supposedly', 'geared', 'towards', 'children', '3-8', 'Personally', 'think', 'age-appropriate', 'range', 'more', '6-10', 'complex', 'concepts', 'introduced.However', 'younger', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'more', 'power', 'certainly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'introduce', 'science', 'younger', 'kids', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'interest.My', '8-year', 'old', 'son', 'really', 'series', 'now', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'when', 'was', 'younger', 'so', 'use', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'series', 'supplement', 'learning/experimenting', 'science', 'principles', 'son', 'love', 'Creepy', 'Crawly', 'Fun', 'especially', 'where', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'voice', 'distorted', 'Also', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'DVD', 'Halloween', 'time', 'especially', 'educational']","The Magic School Bus - Creepy, Crawly Fun!"

In between the Vampire stuff it was learning about bats and insects which a lot of kids enjoy.  It doeshave one episode on this about sound and where does sound come from but they use a haunted house typeset with scary sounds to teach the kids which again if your child does not like that type thing this probablywouldn't be the best thing for your child then.,3,Not the best for us,1383350400,"11 2, 2013",2013,478,"['Magic', 'school', 'buses', 'are', 'great', 'one', 'had', 'lot', 'Vampires', 'scary', 'things', 'son', 'doesnot', 'Vampire', 'stuff', 'was', 'learning', 'bats', 'insects', 'lot', 'kids', 'enjoy', 'doeshave', 'one', 'episode', 'sound', 'where', 'sound', 'come', 'use', 'haunted', 'house', 'typeset', 'scary', 'sounds', 'teach', 'kids', 'again', 'child', 'not', 'like', 'type', 'thing', 'probablywould', ""n't"", 'be', 'best', 'thing', 'child', 'then']","The Magic School Bus - Creepy, Crawly Fun!"

There are three stories on this DVD, i.e. ""Inside the Haunted House"" which focuses on sounds and acoustics; ""Going Batty"" which features nocturnal creatures; and finally, ""Spins a Web"" which covers arachnids. Compared to the other programs in the series, I felt this fell a bit short in terms of presenting facts, hence the three stars. The DVD runs about 20 minutes per episode on average and the language options are English, French, and Spanish.The Magic School Bus DVDs are highly educational and promote children's interest in science, and I feel this series will appeal to children ages 5 and older (as some of the concepts are a bit complex).",3,Fun but not as facts-packed as the others in the series,1275436800,"06 2, 2010",2010,752,"['intrepid', 'Ms.', 'Frizzle', 'students', 'are', 'back', 'further', 'adventures', 'magic', 'school', 'bus', 'are', 'three', 'stories', 'DVD', 'i.e', 'Haunted', 'House', 'sounds', 'acoustics', 'Going', 'Batty', 'nocturnal', 'creatures', 'finally', 'Web', 'arachnids', 'Compared', 'other', 'programs', 'series', 'felt', 'fell', 'bit', 'short', 'terms', 'presenting', 'facts', 'hence', 'three', 'stars', 'DVD', '20', 'minutes', 'episode', 'average', 'language', 'options', 'are', 'English', 'French', 'Spanish.The', 'Magic', 'School', 'Bus', 'DVDs', 'are', 'highly', 'educational', 'promote', 'children', 'interest', 'science', 'feel', 'series', 'will', 'appeal', 'children', '5', 'older', 'concepts', 'are', 'bit', 'complex']","The Magic School Bus - Creepy, Crawly Fun!"
