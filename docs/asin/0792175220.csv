132893,A3W4GJR5CCADBX,0792175220,"""50cent-haircut""","[10, 12]","Bach's first Cello Suite in G wafts through the scenes, and it really captures the meandering nature of the two characters. What is so ingenuous about this film is that here are two characters who seemingly walk different, divergent paths of life, yet are falling headlong in the same direction. The entire film can be seen as an aftermath of a terrible tragedy and how it affects people for the rest of their lives, but under Londergan's sure direction, the message never becomes trite, watered down soundbites of Freudian pathology. The performances are unilaterally wonderful, and Ruffalo especially is powerful as a smoked-out brother who cannot, and stubbornly will not find his place in the world. The sadness between the pauses is poignant, but the hope of the last couple sequences are spine-tingling. The film, by the way, takes the top prize for using the title as a meaningful part of the story, as it is the &quot;punchline&quot; that is left unsaid at the end of the film, the remembered pact between the brother and sister who love each other now as they have back then.

I can honestly say that I can totally  relate to this film.Laura Linney is dead-on as a sister who is trying to live a ""normal"" life; work at the bank, pick up the son in her SUV, and believe in God, about 15 years after the sudden tragic death of her parents. Her brother is immature, unreliable, can't hold a job, and smokes an awful lot of pot. She is the ""caretaker"" in the sibling relationship. But, as the film unveils, she certainly can't take care of herself. And the f-up brother isn't as worthless and stupid and selfish as he is supposed to be.This is a real film about real people dealing with the extrodinarily frustrating and painful task of carrying on after a tragic family loss.

132896,A14N5L5T089VX3,0792175220,"Allen Vander Meulen ""Omnivorous reader""","[4, 4]","Nominated for Academy Awards in 2000 for Best Actress and Best Screenplay, ""You Can Count on Me"" is a story about a sister ""Sammy"" (Laura Linney) and brother ""Terry"" (Mark Ruffalo) who are seeking to live with the emotional scars they carry as a result of childhood traumas.  I use the plural ""traumas"" here because subtle hints throughout the film (even in the very first scene) make it clear that issues other than the sudden death of their parents when they were kids contributed to their woundedness later in life.The film is a rich and complex study of the costs of trauma and abuse, and how the scars they cause stay with us throughout our lives, impacting how we view ourselves and how we view, treat and interact-with friends (and acquaintances).The center of the film is on the ""Big Sister"" (Sammy) in the story, and shows us that, despite trying very hard to give the appearance of being a successful, disciplined, put-together person, is an emotional mess: engaging in self destructive behaviors, displacing her own internal pain and anger onto others, and refusing to admit she has problems.  Laura Linney's performance in this role earned her an Oscar nomination, and rightfully so: she does an excellent job of portraying her character realistically and subtley, avoiding the trap of becoming trite or preachy in her characterization of ""Sammy"".Her brother (Terry) is equally a mess, but in some ways is healthier: admitting he's a mess, and showing he's capable of emotional growth and healing by the time the film ends.  A particularly good scene is his interaction with his sister's inept Pastor (portrayed by the film's writer and director, Kenneth Lonergan).  It becomes clear during the course of this scene that Terry is a much more intelligent, self-aware and thoughtful person than he normally portrays himself to be.  Mark Ruffalo, in this role, strikes a great balance between the troubled, devil-may-care attitude towards life and others that you expect; yet he is also sensitive and caring.  You see his character evolving over the course of the film as he learns that the lives of those around him matter, too.This film seeks to portray complex and subtle emotions and interactions between its characters.  Kenneth Lonergan appears to be very aware of the sources and costs of emotional trauma, and yet was able to portray the subject, in this his first major film, with sensitivity and light humor.  In the end, his work leaves us with multiple messages.  The one I will remember is his message of hope: that no matter how painful or traumatic one's past is, you can overcome it.Well worth watching for those who like emotionally complex characters in interesting dramas: definitely a five star film!",5,A fascinating exploration into the effects of emotional trauma,1270771200,"04 9, 2010",2010,2729,"['Nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', '2000', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Best', 'Screenplay', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'story', 'sister', 'Sammy', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'who', 'are', 'seeking', 'live', 'emotional', 'scars', 'carry', 'result', 'childhood', 'traumas', 'use', 'plural', 'traumas', 'here', 'subtle', 'hints', 'film', 'even', 'very', 'first', 'scene', 'make', 'clear', 'issues', 'other', 'sudden', 'death', 'parents', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'contributed', 'woundedness', 'later', 'life.The', 'film', 'rich', 'complex', 'study', 'costs', 'trauma', 'abuse', 'how', 'scars', 'cause', 'stay', 'lives', 'impacting', 'how', 'view', 'how', 'view', 'treat', 'interact-with', 'friends', 'acquaintances', '.The', 'center', 'film', 'Big', 'Sister', 'Sammy', 'story', 'trying', 'very', 'hard', 'give', 'appearance', 'being', 'successful', 'disciplined', 'put-together', 'person', 'emotional', 'mess', 'engaging', 'self', 'destructive', 'behaviors', 'displacing', 'own', 'internal', 'pain', 'anger', 'others', 'refusing', 'admit', 'problems', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'performance', 'role', 'earned', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'rightfully', 'so', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'character', 'realistically', 'subtley', 'avoiding', 'trap', 'becoming', 'trite', 'preachy', 'characterization', 'Sammy', '.Her', 'brother', 'Terry', 'equally', 'mess', 'ways', 'healthier', 'admitting', 'mess', 'showing', 'capable', 'emotional', 'growth', 'healing', 'time', 'film', 'particularly', 'good', 'scene', 'interaction', 'sister', 'inept', 'Pastor', 'portrayed', 'film', 'writer', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'clear', 'course', 'scene', 'Terry', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'self-aware', 'thoughtful', 'person', 'normally', 'be', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'role', 'great', 'balance', 'troubled', 'devil-may-care', 'attitude', 'towards', 'life', 'others', 'expect', 'also', 'sensitive', 'caring', 'see', 'character', 'evolving', 'course', 'film', 'lives', 'matter', 'too.This', 'film', 'portray', 'complex', 'subtle', 'emotions', 'interactions', 'characters', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'be', 'very', 'aware', 'sources', 'costs', 'emotional', 'trauma', 'yet', 'was', 'able', 'portray', 'subject', 'first', 'major', 'film', 'sensitivity', 'light', 'humor', 'end', 'work', 'multiple', 'messages', 'one', 'will', 'remember', 'message', 'hope', 'matter', 'how', 'painful', 'traumatic', 'one', 'past', 'can', 'overcome', 'it.Well', 'worth', 'watching', 'who', 'like', 'emotionally', 'complex', 'characters', 'interesting', 'dramas', 'definitely', 'five', 'star', 'film']",N/A
132897,A1AHFIGBYPZTXC,0792175220,Amazon Customer,"[8, 9]","Kenneth Lonergan has written and directed a film here that will be studied for years by film school types, enjoyed by audiences, and surely receive an Oscar nod. The question is how to take a nice story and elevate it to the level of a truly great film. The answer is in the talent and artistry of those involved. From the acting to the editing, Lonergan delivers a film that is lean, muscular and as close to perfect as you're likely to see all year.Sammy Prescott (Laura Linney, Truman's wife in The Truman Show) is a tightly wound single mother working at a bank in a sleepy little town in upper New York. Her brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) on the other hand is the sort of drifter that the family only sees on every third Thanksgiving, earning enough money from the odd construction job to get him through to the next adventure in Alaska or Florida or wherever he may find himself. Despite this, the two remain close after a car crash killed their parents when they were teenagers. And when Terry announces his return home, Sammy is ecstatic. Not only does she look forward to seeing him but her son Rudy (Rory Culkin, Macaulay's little brother) could really use a guy around for a while. And of course that's where the trouble starts.Now on the surface, this is your standard 'Bad boy returns to a small town and shakes things up' set up, but it grows into something else that we rarely see: a true to life portrait of a brother-sister relationship. When Terry admits that he really came back to borrow some money, Sammy lets loose on him in a restaurant but the beauty is the build up. Lonergan's script perfectly conveys that awkwardness of seeing a family member after a long time away and the acting is simply superb all around. As the story progresses and Terry bonds with her son, we see Sammy start to revert back to her wilder days, having a giddy affair with her new (and married) boss at the bank (Matthew Broderick in his second real adult role). Terry, meanwhile, relates to 8 year old Rudy like a drinking buddy, making him promise he won't tell his mom about their little clandestine trip to the local pool hall. Of course he's also infuriatingly unreliable and often misguided in his attempts to treat the boy with the respect you feel he may have been missing as a child. Through all the bickering though, there's so much deep seated emotion between the three of them that it's sometimes painful just to watch.This story would also lend itself to melodramatic speeches and weepy musical interludes, but Lonergan's direction is a study in restraint. In one scene, Terry tries to console Sammy: &quot;You remember what we used to say when we were kids? You remember?&quot; She mumbles, &quot;Yeah, I remember&quot; and hugs him, but it's never revealed to us. He's taken each scene and whittled it down to the very essence, where a tug at Sammy's clothing, or an outstretched arm holding a fishing pole takes the place of pages of dialogue. The effect is a marvelously paced and plotted film that can spend it's time on the things that are important, not on beating the emotions out of us with a club. And in this weak year for movie lovers, it's a refreshingly welcome surprise.",5,One of the year's best films!,976492800,"12 11, 2000",2000,3196,"['Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'written', 'directed', 'film', 'here', 'will', 'be', 'studied', 'years', 'film', 'school', 'types', 'enjoyed', 'audiences', 'surely', 'receive', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'question', 'how', 'take', 'nice', 'story', 'elevate', 'level', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'answer', 'talent', 'artistry', 'involved', 'acting', 'editing', 'Lonergan', 'film', 'lean', 'muscular', 'close', 'perfect', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'year.Sammy', 'Prescott', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Truman', 'wife', 'Truman', 'Show', 'tightly', 'wound', 'single', 'mother', 'working', 'bank', 'sleepy', 'little', 'town', 'upper', 'New', 'York', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'other', 'hand', 'sort', 'drifter', 'family', 'only', 'third', 'Thanksgiving', 'earning', 'enough', 'money', 'odd', 'construction', 'job', 'get', 'next', 'adventure', 'Alaska', 'Florida', 'may', 'find', 'two', 'remain', 'close', 'car', 'crash', 'killed', 'parents', 'when', 'were', 'teenagers', 'when', 'Terry', 'return', 'home', 'Sammy', 'ecstatic', 'Not', 'only', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'son', 'Rudy', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Macaulay', 'little', 'brother', 'could', 'really', 'use', 'guy', 'while', 'course', 'where', 'trouble', 'starts.Now', 'surface', 'standard', 'boy', 'returns', 'small', 'town', 'shakes', 'things', 'up', 'set', 'up', 'something', 'else', 'rarely', 'see', 'true', 'life', 'portrait', 'brother-sister', 'relationship', 'When', 'Terry', 'really', 'came', 'back', 'borrow', 'money', 'Sammy', 'loose', 'restaurant', 'beauty', 'build', 'up', 'Lonergan', 'script', 'perfectly', 'awkwardness', 'seeing', 'family', 'member', 'long', 'time', 'away', 'acting', 'simply', 'superb', 'around', 'story', 'progresses', 'Terry', 'bonds', 'son', 'see', 'Sammy', 'start', 'revert', 'back', 'wilder', 'days', 'having', 'giddy', 'affair', 'new', 'married', 'boss', 'bank', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'second', 'real', 'adult', 'role', 'Terry', 'meanwhile', '8', 'year', 'old', 'Rudy', 'drinking', 'buddy', 'making', 'promise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'mom', 'little', 'clandestine', 'trip', 'local', 'pool', 'hall', 'course', 'also', 'infuriatingly', 'unreliable', 'often', 'misguided', 'attempts', 'treat', 'boy', 'respect', 'feel', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'child', 'bickering', 'so', 'much', 'deep', 'seated', 'emotion', 'three', 'sometimes', 'painful', 'just', 'watch.This', 'story', 'would', 'also', 'lend', 'melodramatic', 'speeches', 'weepy', 'musical', 'interludes', 'Lonergan', 'direction', 'study', 'restraint', 'one', 'scene', 'Terry', 'console', 'Sammy', 'quot', 'remember', 'what', 'used', 'say', 'when', 'were', 'kids', 'remember', 'quot', 'quot', 'Yeah', 'remember', 'quot', 'hugs', 'never', 'revealed', 'taken', 'scene', 'whittled', 'down', 'very', 'essence', 'where', 'tug', 'Sammy', 'clothing', 'outstretched', 'arm', 'holding', 'fishing', 'pole', 'place', 'pages', 'dialogue', 'effect', 'marvelously', 'paced', 'plotted', 'film', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'things', 'are', 'important', 'not', 'beating', 'emotions', 'club', 'weak', 'year', 'movie', 'lovers', 'refreshingly', 'welcome', 'surprise']",N/A

132899,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792175220,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","Something as soft and subtle as `You Can Count On Me' is a true delight and a true rarity in the world of cinema.  There are very few films that understand the fact that less is more, and so there are few films that can deliver such natural progressive character developments like those experienced in `You Can Count On Me'.  This gem of a film is the definition of a complete package, bursting at the seam with stunning performances dancing around in a sea of beautifully orchestrated dialog and richly summarized situations that breathe so much authentic life into these characters.There's such warmth here.On the outset of the film we have a fatal car crash that orphans young Samantha and Terry Prescott.  Years later, these two siblings couldn't be any more different.  Terry is irresponsible, while Samantha is responsible to a fault.  When Terry finds himself in another tight spot he decides to make a visit to see his sister (hoping he can get some help).  Having been absent from her life for some time, Sammy is happy to see her brother and hoping they can spend time reconnecting.  What happens is such a beautifully moving example of life working itself out in unexpected ways.  As the two spend time, not necessarily with one another but around one another, they can't help but meet in the middle, finding a strange balance to their own idiosyncrasies.  Terry starts fathering Sammy's son Rudy.  Sammy starts a torrid affair with her boss Brian.  As Terry finds a part of himself he never knew he had through the eyes of a young boy (who very well could represent a part of himself he lost when his parents were stolen from him), Sammy finds a contrastingly similar part of herself by indulging herself in a reckless and foolish affair that is so far outside her comfort zone it proves itself oddly comforting.In the end they reach the balance needed to move on in their lives.Aside from the outstanding screenplay (so tender, so real, so understanding), the performances here are all brilliantly layered and moving.  Mark Ruffalo is an actor I have always enjoyed.  His portrayal of Terry is astonishing.  He really understands the slight tonal shifts that allow a light of reality to filter through his character.  Young Rory Culkin is beautifully used here, even if he has only a few scenes.  I am not a fan of Matthew Broderick, but he had a great pair of years in 1999/2000.  He was astonishingly good in `Election', and he followed that up with a beautifully orchestrated turn as Sammy's boss.  He captures the sarcasm and self-consumed arrogance needed to sell his character without subtracting from the charm level I didn't know he possessed.But there is nothing here that compares to Laura Linney's heart breaking (and heart warming) turn as Sammy.  I love this woman, and I am just consumed with adoration for her work here.  This is easily one of the best performances of the past decade.  She layers Sammy with such believable tension, understanding how this woman's heart is the very thing that is killing her ever so slowly.I don't think anyone plays the `sister' role quite as powerfully as Laura Linney!In the end, `You Can Count On Me' remains one of those films that never ceases to amaze me.  It continues to grow and grow in my eyes as one of the finest films of the past decade.  It's one of those movies that always lingers in the back of my mind, but one I never truly realize just how much I adore until I start to talk about it.I feel as though my love for this movie has grown tenfold in the thirty minutes it took me to map out this review!",5,"Plain and simple, this is life...",1265587200,"02 8, 2010",2010,3581,"['Something', 'soft', 'subtle', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'true', 'delight', 'true', 'rarity', 'world', 'cinema', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'understand', 'fact', 'less', 'more', 'so', 'are', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'deliver', 'such', 'natural', 'progressive', 'character', 'developments', 'experienced', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'gem', 'film', 'definition', 'complete', 'package', 'bursting', 'seam', 'stunning', 'performances', 'dancing', 'around', 'sea', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'dialog', 'richly', 'summarized', 'situations', 'breathe', 'so', 'much', 'authentic', 'life', 'such', 'warmth', 'outset', 'film', 'have', 'fatal', 'car', 'crash', 'young', 'Samantha', 'Terry', 'Prescott', 'Years', 'later', 'two', 'siblings', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'more', 'different', 'Terry', 'irresponsible', 'Samantha', 'responsible', 'fault', 'When', 'Terry', 'tight', 'spot', 'make', 'visit', 'see', 'sister', 'hoping', 'can', 'get', 'help', 'Having', 'been', 'absent', 'life', 'time', 'Sammy', 'happy', 'see', 'brother', 'hoping', 'can', 'spend', 'time', 'reconnecting', 'What', 'such', 'beautifully', 'moving', 'example', 'life', 'working', 'out', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'two', 'spend', 'time', 'not', 'necessarily', 'one', 'one', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'meet', 'middle', 'finding', 'strange', 'balance', 'own', 'idiosyncrasies', 'Terry', 'fathering', 'Sammy', 'son', 'Rudy', 'Sammy', 'torrid', 'affair', 'boss', 'Brian', 'Terry', 'part', 'never', 'knew', 'had', 'eyes', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'represent', 'part', 'lost', 'when', 'parents', 'were', 'stolen', 'Sammy', 'contrastingly', 'similar', 'part', 'herself', 'indulging', 'reckless', 'foolish', 'affair', 'so', 'far', 'comfort', 'zone', 'oddly', 'comforting.In', 'end', 'reach', 'balance', 'needed', 'move', 'lives.Aside', 'outstanding', 'screenplay', 'so', 'tender', 'so', 'real', 'so', 'understanding', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'brilliantly', 'layered', 'moving', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'actor', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'portrayal', 'Terry', 'astonishing', 'really', 'slight', 'tonal', 'shifts', 'allow', 'light', 'reality', 'filter', 'character', 'Young', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'beautifully', 'used', 'here', 'even', 'only', 'few', 'scenes', 'am', 'not', 'fan', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'had', 'great', 'pair', 'years', '1999/2000', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'Election', 'followed', 'up', 'beautifully', 'orchestrated', 'turn', 'Sammy', 'boss', 'sarcasm', 'self-consumed', 'arrogance', 'needed', 'sell', 'character', 'subtracting', 'charm', 'level', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'possessed.But', 'nothing', 'here', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'heart', 'breaking', 'heart', 'warming', 'turn', 'Sammy', 'love', 'woman', 'am', 'just', 'consumed', 'adoration', 'work', 'here', 'easily', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'past', 'decade', 'Sammy', 'such', 'believable', 'tension', 'understanding', 'how', 'woman', 'heart', 'very', 'thing', 'killing', 'ever', 'so', 'slowly.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'anyone', 'sister', 'role', 'quite', 'as', 'powerfully', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'end', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'one', 'films', 'never', 'amaze', 'grow', 'grow', 'eyes', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'past', 'decade', 'one', 'movies', 'always', 'back', 'mind', 'one', 'never', 'truly', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'adore', 'start', 'talk', 'it.I', 'feel', 'love', 'movie', 'grown', 'tenfold', 'thirty', 'minutes', 'took', 'map', 'out', 'review']",N/A
132900,A2UXS5AEDWJEMB,0792175220,Andy Todes,"[64, 68]","Here are the most compelling reasons to buy this film, especially on DVD:Words such as &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;genius&quot; are incredibly overused these days, but I'm prepared to make the following statement: The screenplay is a masterpiece and Mark Ruffalo is a genius. (And Laura Linney, bless your soul, you are a damn fine actress.) Let me take a quick crack at supporting this statement, so that you can get on with the business of watching this movie instead of reading my review.1. THE EDITING: Lonnergan's orginal screenplay chalked up 125 pages, which translates into roughly 125 minutes screen time. AFTER the final edit, Lonnergan RETYPED the screenplay (only a devoted writer and parent would do such a thing) and it yielded 95 pages. Now anyone who has written anything at all can tell you THIS IS SOME MAJOR CUTTING. And for the viewer it means a TIGHT, DIRECT, and WONDERFULLY VISUAL movie. To see what the hell I'm talking about, just check out the crash scene at the beginning of the film and specifically the moment when the policeman struggles to get a word out on the front porch. CUT!! You don't need to see anymore. Lonnergan trusts the audience to put the pieces together and the film moves on. It was at this very early point in the film when I saw it at the theater that I sensed the brilliance to come. And was not let down. You can probably find 20 moments where the scene ends EXACTLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO.  (A comparable film in this respect is &quot;Days of Heaven.&quot;)2. BELIEVABLE CHARACTERS. That means complex characters. Characters who are not ALL GOOD or ALL BAD. Characters who behave in predictable and sometimes highly unpredictable ways, much like you and me.3. SUPERB ACTING. You just don't see such nuanced performances like this every day. Watch Ruffalo carefully. Watch everything he does, even the way he listens to other characters. It's electrifying. His body language is a revelation and his delivery is perfect. I could watch him all day. The first three times I saw the film I was so enthralled by him I almost missed Laura Linney's performance. It is the equal of Ruffalo's.4. THE SCREENPLAY. Everyone raves about the screenplay, so I've put this section near the end so you won't miss the other great qualities of this film. Lonnergan, I understand, wrote every single itty bitty word in the movie, including all the um and ahs.

It is a movie where nothing extraordinary happens, there is no grand final outcome, and we are left wondering about the future of the characters. This movie is mostly character development via small, everyday events that, added together are not much, but which reveal volumes about the characters. They are people we have all known and listened to, dealing with the realities of life. Not the realities as perceived by Hollywood, but the daily grind of living.I laughed and cried at this story of the loser brother and responsible sister. Yet in their own ways, they are both screw-ups. I felt the elation that the sister felt when her brother came back to town, only to have her hopes dashed when he told her why. The brother is goodhearted but undependable and the sister needs dependability so her life runs on schedule for her young son. They are opposites yet alike in that they both are bumbling through life--her life is just more conventional. We see the sadness of lives lived alone whether by design or by an inability to commit.The casting for this movie was terrific, as was the dialogue.

Laura Linney certainly proved herself worthy of her Oscar Buzz, but Mark Ruffalo really took the cake. This guy is definately an up-and-comer: He's got the same devient look and humor as David Cross or Jeremy Piven, but when it really counts, he pulls back into a somber or even sullen state. It's very remarkable.The story is good, and the script allows for the reader to actually infer a few things instead of having everything flung in the audience's face, which is a nice departure. A lot of movies these days make everything so over-obvious you'd think the target audience was a kindergarten class. Not so here.To round things out, Matthew Broderick makes a wonderful weaselly character (think of his &quot;Election&quot; role) and Rory Caulkin does a bang-up job as Linney's 8-year-old son.

Lonergan's direction is awash with nuance; never hammers its audience with moralizing - cunningly judicious, the film's morals will nevertheless remain in your memory.Lowpoints: The ending is a tad stretched-out.Conclusion: It's difficult to pinpoint flaws in this Martin Scorsese-produced little gem, helmed by a Scorsese regular,  screenwriter Kenneth Lonergan, who fills his story with so much realism, drama and wit, that it becomes difficult to isolate certain inconsistencies. Fortunately, ""You Can Count on Me"", which tells a story of a rebel brother named Terry (M. Ruffalo in an ingeniously amenable performance, emanating stubbornness and astuteness), who comes to ask his sister Sammy, a single middle-aged mother  (L. Linney), for some cash. They haven't seen each other for a while, and while eventually their character differences preside, what we as the audience are witnessing throughout the film is raw honesty in the astute interactions between Terry, Sammy, and her little son Rudy. Terry as an intense father-figure results in catastrophe, and while Sammy truly loves him, she has to make sure he leaves before devastating Rudy's flow of daily life. L. Linney is magnificent as church-going Sammy who has a spontaneous affair with her boss (M. Broderick). Inspired by her defiant brother's visit, she delves into the affair headfirst, displaying the consequent conflicting emotions with awesome result.

The big budgets go to secure star power, special effects wizardry, lots of advertising, and top talent behind the scenes, in the hopes that many will get rich(er) by using the various formulae used by Hollywood to gauge audience appeal.  Usually the big budget flicks rake in multiple millions every week and the less moneyed projects get lost in the shuffle.And then occasionally, against all odds, a small film like this sneaks through.  Oh sure, good connections help (Martin Scorsese as executive producer), and having a name in a supporting role (Matthew Broderick) is helpful as well, but it's truly a delight to see unknown and little-known performers, directors, writers, etc., triumph against those odds and create something of lasting beauty, a truly magic moment in movie history that makes the viewer feel warm without being sappy, laugh without jokes, and care about the characters without unfair manipulation.""You Can Count On Me"" is one of those rare few.  You might compare it to ""Tender Mercies"" in its themes of family, faith,  freedom, and frustration.  From the first scene of the film, when a wife comments to her husband, ""Why do they put braces on girls right at the exact moment when they're most self-conscious about their appearance?"" to the final scene when Sammy rolls down the window of her car (a gesture that carries significance), there's not a predictable moment nor a wasted one.  From the lead roles down to the smallest one-scene appearance, writer/director Kenneth Lonergan, whose only previous screen credit had been ""story by"" for ""Analyze This,"" brings out the most incredible performances imaginable, including an 8-year-old named Rory Culkin (yep, Macaulay's youngest brother) who is clever but a real kid, not overplayed, overused, or over-cuted.  In fact, I don't recall a single moment where you'll ""catch the actors acting,"" it plays so authentically.  The sophisticated viewer will even note how wonderful the editing is.If only someone had come up with a better title.  ""You Can Count On Me"" sounds like the name of a Lifetime movie of the week, as if it were some cloying chick flick goofball romantic comedy.  Instead it's a deep, mature film with heart, dealing with some tough life issues with a real love for its characters.It made the NY Times list of ""1000 best movies ever made.""

Years later and Sammy is a single mother of 8-year-old Rudy (Rory Culkin), she works hard at her job at the bank, now run by over critical Brain Everett (Matthew Broderick), and she struggles with telling her son just how much of a jerk his father really is (Josh Lucas has a great cameo as Rudy Senior).  When Terry shows up after months of no communication Sammy is immediately thrilled, but shortly after his arrival she realizes her brother is still a screw-up and is just using her, again.Terry shows up in need of money to pay for his girlfriend's abortion, but when his girlfriend tries to commit suicide he decides he needs to take a break from his life and so he stays with Sammy and Rudy.  Over the course of a few weeks Terry has made a deep impact, especially in the life of young Rudy who idolizes him.

A case in point is the crucial bout of violence.  The films of Shane Meadows usually feature such a scene, which have a tendency to break the fragile nature of the home or society in which it is played out.  It's either bleakly final (24:7) or desperately covered up ('A Room For Romeo Brass').  Director Lonergan doesn't quite have the courage of this scene, and neuters it with tears, big smiles and hugs.  This is symptomatic of the film as a whole, where even the mumbling are prodigiously articulate.  And yet, deep down, the film's circular pattern, where a couple representing Happy Family  die in a car, and a couple representing Family That Can't Live Together drive apart, suggests more searching themes.

It received two Oscar nominations: Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress (Linney).  This unfortunely underrated film has captured the hearts of many since its release.  Its plot of a woman living a tough life reunites with her brother.  She must try everything possible to prevent him from making potential mistakes and to help him rid the trouble he's already endured.  Meanwhile, she begins an affair with her boss who's married.  Such substancial order of events and others keep the drama and the emotion alive throughout the film.  As the characters' turmoilic drama explores itself one on one, the substance grows while keeping the plot interesting.  The performers express these emotional themes beautifully, namely Linney and Ruffalo.

This film was nominated for 2 Oscars: Best Actress(Linney) and Best Original Screenplay(Lonergan).  Everyone I know who has seen this film has enjoyed every minute of it.  The acting is superb, the characters are interesting and endearing, and the script is amazingly solid.  Mark Ruffalo is convincing in his portrayal of a loner who has lost his faith in humanity and himself.  As for Laura Linney, she was nominated for her first Oscar for her splendid work here.  The entire cast should be mentioned in support, particularly Matthew Broderick who adds both strain and a child-like enthusiasm to the story, and in all the right degrees.

In other words, it is a good example of the sort of quality film American audiences usually ignore while they lament the lack of such films.  It is a pity, but then again, true film buffs will always find a way to discover these film for their true value.  Basically, this is a movie about a long-absent brother who returns to his sister's home, where she lives with her son, and the family drama that ensues thereafter.  Nothing mind-blowing, no special effects, just good and honest acting at its finest.  Laura Linney is just so incredibly good in this movie, I don't know why she didn't win the Best Actress Oscar (at least she was nominated).  She really created a believable (wonderful yet flawed) character.  Matthew Broderick adds a slice of sly humor as her weasly boss.The DVD itself is nicely done, no thrills or frills but competently done.  If you like such films as &quot;Ruby in Paradise&quot; (Ashley Judd's first starring role and by far her best performance), &quot;Ulee's Gold&quot; (Peter Fonda's best performance in ages), &quot;The Straight Story&quot; (a G-rated David Lynch film, what will he think of next, but it is a masterpiece of FAMILY entertainment), &quot;The Horse Whisperer&quot; (Scarlett Johansson was so good in this film as the emotionally-scarred girl that the Academy Awards really dropped the ball when she wasn't nominated!), or &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot; (Atom Etoyan's masterpiece about loss), you will enjoy this film just fine!

132917,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,0792175220,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 3]","Kenneth Lonergan's script is so poignantly observant that I couldn't help but be impressed by this relatively quiet drama, one that focuses on a mostly overlooked relationship in movies, the delicate connection between brother and sister during their adult years. The story begins abruptly with the auto accident deaths of the main characters' parents, a life-altering incident that serves as the catalyst for all the failures both children experience later in their lives. Of course, the siblings become a study in contrasts. The brother Terry is a drifting ne'er-do-well who refuses to be entangled in anything resembling responsibility since it means he needs to make an emotional investment. His sister Sammy is the polar opposite, a controlling perfectionist who stayed on in their hometown to make an orderly life for herself and her son. It's the only means she knows to insulate them from complications that would force her to question her existence. She holds down a respectable but dull job as a lending officer at a bank, keeps a well-intentioned suitor at arm's length and continues to hope for a male role model for her lonely son. When Terry comes to town for a visit, the fulcrum of emotions felt by both characters seems so real that it makes the episodic nature of the film seem all the more cohesive and touching. It's a remarkable achievement for Lonergan, who makes his feature film directorial debut with this film. He even plays a small role as the deadpan local minister who seems to be satisfied dispensing advice in a vacuum.The acting by the leads is superb. In his first major role, Mark Ruffalo captures the ramshackle nature of Terry with an effective mix of child-like innocence and restless bravado. Ruffalo provides heart to a basically unsympathetic character without compromising the emotional inertia that drains everyone around him. But I have to hand the picture to Laura Linney, who is letter perfect as Sammy. Her porcelain looks and pinched demeanor provide a veneer for an emotionally fragile woman who is conflicted about not only her brother but her entire existence as she starts to feel it unravel. The scenes between these two actors are consistently wonderful. Best among them are the lunch scene where her excitement in seeing him quickly turns to disappointment when she realizes the true purpose of his visit; the amusing pot-smoking scene on the porch when she confesses the adulterous affair she's having with her boss; and the heartbreaking goodbye when she realizes how much she needs him in her life regardless of the pain he inflicts. Rory Culkin plays Sammy's son Rudy with quiet maturity, and the interplay between Culkin and Ruffalo is well handled as it becomes apparent that the death of Terry's parents has actually made him the same emotional age as Rudy. In a supporting role, Matthew Broderick plays Sammy's boss with the smarmy, honey-toned pretension at which he has become a master, and he is the impetus behind the hilarious scenes at the bank, which take on a Dilbert-esque flavor with pinpoint accuracy. Twangy country songs provide a comic counterpoint to the illicit scenes between him and Sammy.I really like this film and look forward to seeing what Lonergan will do next. The DVD includes a short documentary, which includes interviews with Lonergan, Linney and Ruffalo. Strongly recommended especially for those who have danced precipitously between love and anger with their families.",5,"Ties between Brother and Sister, Beautifully Executed",1099699200,"11 6, 2004",2004,3462,"['Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'script', 'so', 'poignantly', 'observant', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'impressed', 'relatively', 'quiet', 'drama', 'one', 'mostly', 'overlooked', 'relationship', 'movies', 'delicate', 'connection', 'brother', 'sister', 'adult', 'years', 'story', 'abruptly', 'auto', 'accident', 'deaths', 'main', 'characters', 'parents', 'life-altering', 'incident', 'catalyst', 'failures', 'children', 'experience', 'later', 'lives', 'course', 'siblings', 'become', 'study', 'contrasts', 'brother', 'Terry', 'drifting', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'who', 'be', 'entangled', 'anything', 'resembling', 'responsibility', 'make', 'emotional', 'investment', 'sister', 'Sammy', 'polar', 'opposite', 'controlling', 'perfectionist', 'who', 'stayed', 'hometown', 'make', 'orderly', 'life', 'herself', 'son', 'only', 'insulate', 'complications', 'would', 'force', 'question', 'existence', 'down', 'respectable', 'dull', 'job', 'lending', 'officer', 'bank', 'well-intentioned', 'suitor', 'arm', 'length', 'hope', 'male', 'role', 'model', 'lonely', 'son', 'When', 'Terry', 'town', 'visit', 'fulcrum', 'emotions', 'felt', 'characters', 'so', 'real', 'episodic', 'nature', 'film', 'seem', 'more', 'cohesive', 'touching', 'remarkable', 'achievement', 'Lonergan', 'who', 'feature', 'film', 'directorial', 'debut', 'film', 'even', 'small', 'role', 'deadpan', 'local', 'minister', 'who', 'be', 'satisfied', 'dispensing', 'advice', 'vacuum.The', 'acting', 'leads', 'superb', 'first', 'major', 'role', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'ramshackle', 'nature', 'Terry', 'effective', 'mix', 'child-like', 'innocence', 'restless', 'bravado', 'Ruffalo', 'heart', 'basically', 'unsympathetic', 'character', 'compromising', 'emotional', 'inertia', 'everyone', 'have', 'hand', 'picture', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'letter', 'perfect', 'Sammy', 'porcelain', 'looks', 'pinched', 'demeanor', 'provide', 'veneer', 'emotionally', 'fragile', 'woman', 'who', 'conflicted', 'not', 'only', 'brother', 'entire', 'existence', 'feel', 'unravel', 'scenes', 'two', 'actors', 'are', 'consistently', 'wonderful', 'Best', 'are', 'lunch', 'scene', 'where', 'excitement', 'seeing', 'quickly', 'disappointment', 'when', 'true', 'purpose', 'visit', 'amusing', 'pot-smoking', 'scene', 'porch', 'when', 'adulterous', 'affair', 'having', 'boss', 'heartbreaking', 'goodbye', 'when', 'how', 'much', 'life', 'regardless', 'pain', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Sammy', 'son', 'Rudy', 'quiet', 'maturity', 'interplay', 'Culkin', 'Ruffalo', 'well', 'handled', 'apparent', 'death', 'Terry', 'parents', 'actually', 'made', 'same', 'emotional', 'age', 'Rudy', 'supporting', 'role', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'Sammy', 'boss', 'smarmy', 'honey-toned', 'pretension', 'become', 'master', 'impetus', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'bank', 'take', 'Dilbert-esque', 'flavor', 'pinpoint', 'accuracy', 'Twangy', 'country', 'songs', 'provide', 'comic', 'counterpoint', 'illicit', 'scenes', 'Sammy.I', 'really', 'film', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'what', 'Lonergan', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'DVD', 'short', 'documentary', 'interviews', 'Lonergan', 'Linney', 'Ruffalo', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'especially', 'who', 'have', 'danced', 'precipitously', 'love', 'anger', 'families']",N/A

I think it is one of the top films of the year 2000.Laura Linney plays Sammy, a divorced mother of one child, Rudy.  Rudy is played by one of MacCauley Culkin's little brothers..He reminds me so much Mac in his earlier days(think Home Alone) I really loved her performance, and I think she so deserved that Academy Award way more than Julia Roberts did.  She had great expressions, emotions. Her whole hearted portrayal of Sammy is so amazing.  Things start to change for her when her &quot;free spirited&quot; brother, Terry, blows back into town to borrow money from her and ends up staying for a visit. The story takes place in a small town, and it's seems as if the characters all know each other so well.  It is such a good film that I could easily watch it again and will eventually buy.  I have a brother that is very much like Terry, and could totally identify with this film.  I think alot of us will see something in it that reminds us of our own lives.

I still didn't find what all the praise was about.  This is a well-meaning film that is well-written and well-acted to show ordinary people with ordinary situations they have to cope with in their lives.  But that's the problem.  Everything is too ordinary.The main story is about what happens when a grown-up brother and sister are reunited after a lack of communication for awhile.  He is somewhat of a drifter, and she is a single mom who works at a bank.  The bond they share is that their parents were killed when they were young, and they've depended on each other for mutual support for many years.  When the brother returns, she has to make a decision on whether it is a good or bad influence on the son.  Complicating matters are the identity of the father of the child, the current dull boyfriend, and a new boss so finicky he needs standard computer screen colors for his entire staff.I'm looking at these events compared to those of my own life.  I have four children, and it seems like every week we have some kind of crisis that makes anything that happens in the movie seem tame.  I mean, her brother takes the kid out to a pool hall.  Maybe if he were turning the kid on to the pot he smokes in the movie it would be a big thing, but I find myself saying that this woman has no problems.While the portrayal of her new boss is dead-on accurate, I myself has a boss that makes this one look like Jim Belushi.  I live with my situation, and once again, I'm trying to find out what the problem is here.  For the record, I'm not having an affair with my boss, and I guess showing her having her affair is to show her as a flawed, human character.In conclusion, I don't think the brother is so bad, I don't think the boss is THAT bad, and I don't think the mother is that over-protective.  If the writers would like some REAL things to be worried about, they can ask my family, or better yet, watch &quot;Malcom in the Middle&quot;, which is much more realistic than this film.By the way, my wife watched it with me, and also asked what the big deal was.",2,Somebody wake me when something happens,1025481600,"07 1, 2002",2002,2165,"[""'m"", 'sorry', 'header', 'cruel', 'sat', 'film', 'twice', 'just', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'still', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'what', 'praise', 'was', 'about', 'well-meaning', 'film', 'well-written', 'well-acted', 'show', 'ordinary', 'people', 'ordinary', 'situations', 'have', 'cope', 'lives', 'problem', 'Everything', 'too', 'ordinary.The', 'main', 'story', 'what', 'when', 'grown-up', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'reunited', 'lack', 'communication', 'awhile', 'somewhat', 'drifter', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'bank', 'bond', 'share', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'when', 'were', 'young', ""'ve"", 'depended', 'other', 'mutual', 'support', 'many', 'years', 'When', 'brother', 'returns', 'make', 'decision', 'good', 'bad', 'influence', 'son', 'Complicating', 'matters', 'are', 'identity', 'father', 'child', 'current', 'dull', 'boyfriend', 'new', 'boss', 'so', 'finicky', 'standard', 'computer', 'screen', 'colors', 'entire', 'staff.I', ""'m"", 'looking', 'events', 'compared', 'own', 'life', 'have', 'four', 'children', 'week', 'have', 'kind', 'crisis', 'anything', 'movie', 'seem', 'tame', 'mean', 'brother', 'kid', 'pool', 'hall', 'Maybe', 'were', 'turning', 'kid', 'pot', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'big', 'thing', 'find', 'saying', 'woman', 'portrayal', 'new', 'boss', 'dead-on', 'accurate', 'boss', 'one', 'look', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'live', 'situation', 'once', 'again', ""'m"", 'trying', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'problem', 'here', 'record', ""'m"", 'not', 'having', 'affair', 'boss', 'guess', 'showing', 'having', 'affair', 'show', 'flawed', 'human', 'character.In', 'conclusion', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'brother', 'so', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'boss', 'bad', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mother', 'over-protective', 'writers', 'would', 'like', 'REAL', 'things', 'be', 'worried', 'can', 'ask', 'family', 'better', 'yet', 'watch', 'quot', 'Malcom', 'Middle', 'quot', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'way', 'wife', 'watched', 'also', 'asked', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was']",N/A
132922,A2E0CB9F9BMXUJ,0792175220,"Eugene Wei ""eugene""","[5, 7]","This is one of those types of films where the things not shown on the screen, not spoken between the characters, and not resolved by the director are just as meaningful as those that are. In other words, director Kenneth Lonergan does not generate the usual predictable Hollywood feel good story. &quot;You Can Count On Me&quot; is much too mature and real a film to resort to old plot devices like that. It is quite a surprise coming from Lonergan, whose previous work included writing credits on &quot;Analyze This&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot;.Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo are exceptional as Samantha (Sammy) and Terry Prescott, older sister and younger brother. I will not ruin too many of the key plot points, except to note that they are put under lots of stress early in the life, and the story begins when Terry drifts back into Sammy's life in the small town where she lives. It's the type of small town where everyone knows the sheriff and the priest and pretty much everyone else by name.Sammy is a single mother of a young boy Rudy, played by the youngest of the Culkin brothers Rory in a very strong child performance (I find those to be rare). As with many older siblings, she tries to be as responsible as possible, and on some levels she succeeds. She tries as hard as she can to shield her son from the truth about his father, and she juggles a job at a local bank with her duties as a mother. But she is struggling to maintain order and integrity in her life while finding happiness for herself, and sometimes the lines are confused. Linney hasn't had too many big parts in the past, but in this film she is thoroughly convincing.Terry is your classic charming rogue, the rebellious youngest sibling always getting into trouble, unable to hold down a job, always in need of borrowing a few bucks, drifting from town to town around America by bus, but able to survive on his toughness and smooth tongue. Ruffalo is amazing in this role. He drives Sammy crazy because he is so unreliable, because she loves him and wishes desperately wants for him what she thinks is important in life: to hold down a steady job, generate a steady stream of income, stay out of prison. He looks at his sister and sees through her veneer of responsibility and control and sees someone who has settled in for a dull, sheltered life in a provincial town. He also sees how sheltered a life Rudy lives and immediately jumps into that void and becomes Rudy's friend and father figure. The scene where he takes Rudy to a pool hall is priceless.The movie is both touching and funny (Matthew Broderick makes a comic cameo as Sammy's new bank manager), and by the end of the film you love the characters because you know how flawed they are and how hard they are trying to do what's right. There are no scripted Hollywood happy endings, nor are there scripted unhappy endings. This is the type of movie I can watch over and over again, because it is such an open story. Is Terry or Sammy more in control? Will either of them be happy? Will Sammy remarry? Will Terry ever settle down into a real job? The beauty of this movie is that by the end of the film, these and a hundred other questions are left unanswered, and you may or may not have the answers, but you will care enough to ask them.",5,Wonderful story about the love between brother and sister,977184000,"12 19, 2000",2000,3313,"['one', 'types', 'films', 'where', 'things', 'not', 'shown', 'screen', 'not', 'spoken', 'characters', 'not', 'resolved', 'director', 'are', 'just', 'as', 'meaningful', 'are', 'other', 'words', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'not', 'generate', 'usual', 'predictable', 'Hollywood', 'feel', 'good', 'story', 'quot', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'quot', 'much', 'too', 'mature', 'real', 'film', 'resort', 'old', 'plot', 'devices', 'quite', 'surprise', 'coming', 'Lonergan', 'previous', 'work', 'included', 'writing', 'credits', 'quot', 'Analyze', 'quot', 'quot', 'Adventures', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'quot', '.Laura', 'Linney', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'are', 'exceptional', 'Samantha', 'Sammy', 'Terry', 'Prescott', 'older', 'sister', 'younger', 'brother', 'will', 'not', 'ruin', 'too', 'many', 'key', 'plot', 'points', 'note', 'are', 'put', 'lots', 'stress', 'early', 'life', 'story', 'when', 'Terry', 'back', 'Sammy', 'life', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'type', 'small', 'town', 'where', 'everyone', 'sheriff', 'priest', 'pretty', 'much', 'everyone', 'else', 'name.Sammy', 'single', 'mother', 'young', 'boy', 'Rudy', 'played', 'youngest', 'Culkin', 'brothers', 'Rory', 'very', 'strong', 'child', 'performance', 'find', 'be', 'rare', 'many', 'older', 'siblings', 'be', 'as', 'responsible', 'possible', 'levels', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'shield', 'son', 'truth', 'father', 'job', 'local', 'bank', 'duties', 'mother', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'order', 'integrity', 'life', 'finding', 'happiness', 'herself', 'sometimes', 'lines', 'are', 'confused', 'Linney', ""n't"", 'had', 'too', 'many', 'big', 'parts', 'past', 'film', 'thoroughly', 'convincing.Terry', 'classic', 'charming', 'rogue', 'rebellious', 'youngest', 'sibling', 'always', 'getting', 'trouble', 'unable', 'hold', 'down', 'job', 'always', 'need', 'borrowing', 'few', 'bucks', 'drifting', 'town', 'town', 'around', 'America', 'bus', 'able', 'survive', 'toughness', 'smooth', 'tongue', 'Ruffalo', 'amazing', 'role', 'Sammy', 'crazy', 'so', 'unreliable', 'wishes', 'desperately', 'what', 'important', 'life', 'hold', 'down', 'steady', 'job', 'generate', 'steady', 'stream', 'income', 'stay', 'prison', 'sister', 'veneer', 'responsibility', 'control', 'sees', 'someone', 'who', 'settled', 'dull', 'sheltered', 'life', 'provincial', 'town', 'also', 'how', 'sheltered', 'life', 'Rudy', 'immediately', 'jumps', 'void', 'Rudy', 'friend', 'father', 'figure', 'scene', 'where', 'Rudy', 'pool', 'hall', 'priceless.The', 'movie', 'touching', 'funny', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'comic', 'cameo', 'Sammy', 'new', 'bank', 'manager', 'end', 'film', 'love', 'characters', 'know', 'how', 'flawed', 'are', 'how', 'hard', 'are', 'trying', 'do', 'what', 'right', 'are', 'scripted', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'endings', 'are', 'there', 'scripted', 'unhappy', 'endings', 'type', 'movie', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'such', 'open', 'story', 'Terry', 'Sammy', 'more', 'control', 'Will', 'be', 'happy', 'Will', 'Sammy', 'remarry', 'Will', 'Terry', 'ever', 'settle', 'down', 'real', 'job', 'beauty', 'movie', 'end', 'film', 'hundred', 'other', 'questions', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'answers', 'will', 'care', 'enough', 'ask']",N/A

Just shut yourself from the world for 2 hours and focus on this movie. It will open your mind and heart to another town, another family, another person, another child.one of the most finely craft movies I have seen this year on DVD. I am sorry I missed it in the theatres because this is one of those films you want to spend money on because you want to see such great action and directing rewarded. Laura Linney is mesmerizing as the sister who never quite figures out what she wants from life. Her solution is to make herself needed in other people's lives, fulfilling their fantasies and needs but never giving in completely. So they will always want her.The brother is another character we can all identify with. Both the sister and brother are flawed human beings. That is why we could identify with them so well. The loss of their parents also meant the loss of their childhood. They never had the opportunity to be children and so the transfer to adulthood is filled with problems and inability to cope with playing the role of an adult.Imagine  yourself sipping a fine wine and you'll get a taste of how this movie feels. Each scene is precious and contains such rich texture.

132924,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,0792175220,"""flickjunkie""","[4, 4]","If there is one thing that is striking about this film it is the sheer believability of it.  This is an extremely human story stripped down to everyday realities in the lives of ordinary people.  This is certainly one of the best and most compelling films of 2000.  Writer/director Ken Lonergan, who as a writer has given us such deep and subtle works as ""Analyze This"" and ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" has outdone himself by light years with this moving story of regular folks dealing with common problems.Lonergan's direction of the actors is superb.  He always seems to strike just the right emotional note without the need for flashy technical tricks or stylized cuts and camera angles.  He lets the actors and their story dominate the screen, and he doesn't attempt to insert his directorial ego into the frame.  More and more I am coming to appreciate directors who know how to stay out of the way.  The character development is deep and sensitively done.  We learn to care about Sammy (Laura Linney) for her level headed strength and for Terry (Mark Ruffalo) despite his temperamental arrogance and loser mentality.  Throughout the film, the viewer is tempted to exhort Sammy to slam the door on her brother, though we know she can't do and shouldn't do it.  In the end, the bond between them is so touching and noble that it transcends the adversity through which they put one another.  Schmaltzy?  Yes, but an all too real portrayal of how people often do what they must instead of what they should.Laura Linney delivers a career performance in this film garnering a Best Actress nomination from the Academy.  It was an honor that was well deserved.  Linney makes Sammy a character that is admirable and lovable despite her human foibles.  It is a performance that runs broad and deep, examining the many facets and emotions of this middle class woman struggling to maintain her dignity and confer strong values to her son.  Mark Ruffalo is also outstanding as the embittered brother suffering from deep seated insecurities.  Ruffalo delivers a powerful portrayal of young man whose disappointments in life have gotten the better of him.  Yet despite the hardness of the character, he is able to show a gentle vulnerability and sincere affection with Sammy that makes many of the scenes so poignant.  The brother-sister chemistry between Linney and Ruffalo is perfect, at times nasty and resentful in its familiarity, yet with an underlying bond of love that is indestructible.Matthew Broderick is effective as Sammy's supercilious boss, who is more concerned with arbitrary rules than with the people that work for him.  Broderick, who is accustomed to playing quirky but likeable characters, does surprisingly well as the jerk.  His clueless insensitivity is a good imitation of the many people who let a little authority go to their heads.This film shows that an independent film with a microscopic budget can outdo the major studios armed only with an honest, simple story and an insightful director.  I rated it a 10/10.  It is one of the best character studies I have seen in some time.  It is a treat for the refined viewer.",5,Fabulous independent film,1012694400,"02 3, 2002",2002,3152,"['one', 'thing', 'striking', 'film', 'sheer', 'believability', 'extremely', 'human', 'story', 'stripped', 'down', 'everyday', 'realities', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'people', 'certainly', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'compelling', 'films', '2000', 'Writer/director', 'Ken', 'Lonergan', 'who', 'writer', 'given', 'such', 'deep', 'subtle', 'works', 'Analyze', 'Adventures', 'Rocky', 'Bullwinkle', 'outdone', 'light', 'years', 'moving', 'story', 'regular', 'folks', 'dealing', 'common', 'problems.Lonergan', 'direction', 'actors', 'superb', 'always', 'strike', 'just', 'right', 'emotional', 'note', 'need', 'flashy', 'technical', 'tricks', 'stylized', 'cuts', 'camera', 'angles', 'actors', 'story', 'dominate', 'screen', ""n't"", 'attempt', 'insert', 'directorial', 'ego', 'frame', 'More', 'more', 'am', 'coming', 'appreciate', 'directors', 'who', 'know', 'how', 'stay', 'way', 'character', 'development', 'deep', 'sensitively', 'done', 'learn', 'care', 'Sammy', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'level', 'headed', 'strength', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'temperamental', 'arrogance', 'loser', 'mentality', 'film', 'viewer', 'tempted', 'exhort', 'Sammy', 'slam', 'door', 'brother', 'know', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', 'should', ""n't"", 'do', 'end', 'bond', 'so', 'touching', 'noble', 'adversity', 'put', 'one', 'Schmaltzy', 'Yes', 'too', 'real', 'portrayal', 'how', 'people', 'often', 'do', 'what', 'must', 'instead', 'what', 'should.Laura', 'Linney', 'career', 'performance', 'film', 'garnering', 'Best', 'Actress', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'was', 'honor', 'was', 'well', 'deserved', 'Linney', 'Sammy', 'character', 'admirable', 'lovable', 'human', 'foibles', 'performance', 'broad', 'deep', 'examining', 'many', 'facets', 'emotions', 'middle', 'class', 'woman', 'struggling', 'maintain', 'dignity', 'confer', 'strong', 'values', 'son', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'also', 'outstanding', 'embittered', 'brother', 'suffering', 'deep', 'seated', 'insecurities', 'Ruffalo', 'powerful', 'portrayal', 'young', 'man', 'disappointments', 'life', 'have', 'gotten', 'better', 'hardness', 'character', 'able', 'show', 'gentle', 'vulnerability', 'sincere', 'affection', 'Sammy', 'many', 'scenes', 'so', 'poignant', 'brother-sister', 'chemistry', 'Linney', 'Ruffalo', 'perfect', 'times', 'nasty', 'resentful', 'familiarity', 'yet', 'underlying', 'bond', 'love', 'indestructible.Matthew', 'Broderick', 'effective', 'Sammy', 'supercilious', 'boss', 'who', 'more', 'concerned', 'arbitrary', 'rules', 'people', 'work', 'Broderick', 'who', 'accustomed', 'playing', 'quirky', 'likeable', 'characters', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'jerk', 'clueless', 'insensitivity', 'good', 'imitation', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'let', 'little', 'authority', 'go', 'heads.This', 'film', 'independent', 'film', 'microscopic', 'budget', 'can', 'outdo', 'major', 'studios', 'armed', 'only', 'honest', 'simple', 'story', 'insightful', 'director', 'rated', '10/10', 'one', 'best', 'character', 'studies', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'treat', 'refined', 'viewer']",N/A

The plot itself is simple, but the excellent and low-key acting (Laura Linney, Mark Ruffalo, Rory Culkin, Matthew Broderick), the witty dialogue, the cozy direction and the adequate score make this a must-see cinematic experience.A superb family drama that perfectly combines melancholy and comedy (intelligent and heartfelt comedy, not predictable slapstick), this movie is as good as the also great (and very overlooked) &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot;, by Brad Silberling, and much better than some overrated average dramas like &quot;Magnolia&quot; or &quot;The Hours&quot;, both self-important pieces of filmaking.&quot;You Can Count On Me&quot; is a pleasant example of &quot;americana&quot;, giving an absorbing and interesting portrait of flawed yet likable individuals.

Terry's attempts to bond with her son are only partly successful and lead to a lot of trouble. Linney also struggles emotionally with a number of other male characters in the movie. One is her boss (and lover) Brian, played by Matthew Broderick, as well as a complex relationship with her (sort of)boyfriend, who she can't quite commit to marrying.

Because I felt so much empathy for the main characters in this film I have taken a personal interest in leading the horse to water, so to speak.  This movie was amazing.  Maybe it helped that Mark Ruffalo was more or less unknown when it came out, but his scenes all seemed so unbelievably real.  I think the most powerful was when he takes his nephew to see his cold, son-of-a-... father.  The thrill I felt when he punched him, and the accompanying guilt that soon followed were so primal.  It was almost as real as if it was.  The nephew was great too, forced to become ""the man of the house"" well before he should have. I don't think it's fair to Laura Linney that my praise is all for her co-stars, but I felt at times she was acting.  Her character's reactions are pulled from the same suitcase her prosecutor lugged around in Primal Fear.  I hate world-weariness that seems false.  If you're over the age of 12, you've seen enough to be genuienly world-weary.  Anyhow, her scenes are still credible, and she's best when you can see the mischeviousness beneath her been-there, I'm tough, facade. All-in-all, I think this film best demonstrated cinema's capacity to reveal human longing and need out of last year's slate, Crouching Tiger be ... (don't get me started on last year's Blair Witch project).  The character are vulnerable, endearing, exasperating-enough adjectives though.  I have a running argument with a friend who claims that movies are grossly inferior to books (Voltaire couldn't see why people got all hot and bothered over Shakespheare).  I know that people who feel that way tend to universally debase popular tastes, but with Jurassic Park III and Cats and Dogs coming out soon, sometimes I forget why he's wrong.

Like most people she has no real clue about what it is that she wants in her own life.  Yet she proceeds to denegrate her wandering brother for his carefree nature.  A bit hypocritical if you ask me.  She talks about her brother settling down yet she jumps from one (stable) man to another (totally unavailable) one.  At least the brother is honest about his feelings.Her brother on the other hand emparts more wisdom on a variety of subjects than Ms. Linney's character could ever imagine.  And the sad irony is that the grown up brother is an outstanding uncle/father to her son.  It makes you wonder how he would have turned out if their parents had been around.

Linney plays Sammy, a single mother struggling to raise her son whil dealing with a frustrating job at her bank, a job made difficult mainly because of her new manager, played by Matthew Broderick. To add to the mix, her brother suddenly shows up and lives with her for awhile. Mark Ruffalo was stunning as the brother and I look forward to seeing him in more movies.  I really related to Sammy, perhaps because of Laura Linney's skill in making her come alive. She is a woman who can't resist those in need, which explains why she is drawn to her bank manager while also juggling a relationship with a long-term boyfriend.

Start with Laura Linney, a divorced mom with a few work problems, a good relationship with her son, and an adult younger brother who drives her crazy.That younger brother, Terry, is played by Mark Ruffalo. Totally unhinged and irresponsible, Terry visits his sister in order to collect money for his girlfriend's abortion.  He then stays for a few days; after all, she's his sister, and she lives in his hometown too.  But can his sister count on him?  He's not dependable.  Can she share a house with a man who lives like he's still a teenager? Can she even trust Terry to babysit her son?  Ruffalo's performance is amazing.  He pulls off the character seemingly with ease.  Kudos to the director and producer for making this movie.  Movies about adult brother-sister relationships are scarce these days.Matthew Broderick gets some credit for playing Linney's supervisor, a soon-to-be dad with a knack for rubbing his new employees the wrong way.  His chemistry with Linney is obvious, and these two create scenes of office confrontation which are priceless.Then there is Kenneth Lonergan as the priest.  Liberal, not pushy, and very caring, he tries to help people through.  Lonergan, also the film's director, gives a good performance.The drama revolves around Linney's character, as she tries to deal with juggling motherhood, sisterhood, and her job, not to mention her social life.  Just wait until you see the guy that she dates...See YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

But it was, and maybe that's why he tried so hard to get everything just right.  Well, he succeeded.  Laura Linney and Mark Ruffolo are wonderfully cast and extrememly believable as brother and sister.  One who's a bit of a wanderer and the other who's a single mom.  Another surprise was playing Rudy, Rory Culkin...who's quiet maturity really fit well with Linney's character, and a great opposition to his uncle played by Ruffolo.  But the movie is really about the impacts that they all have on one another, and the ways in which they change each other's lives (for the better).  I really enjoyed the film and the supporting roles by Matthew Broderick and Lonnergan's wife as Linney's co-worker (with the color coded computer screen).  I love that Lonnergan resisted ending his movie with a cookie cutter/neat package ending and really admire that he stuck by his vision and didn't get talked into that formula by execs with no guts.

In fact this is a charming and insightful film about small-town life and relationships, centering around a brother and sister who, orphaned when small children (the subject of the film's brief prologue), find themselves two adults with drastically different outlooks on life. How they clash, make up and learn from one another when the brother returns to their hometown after a long absence makes for one funny and/or moving scene after another. Laura Linney didn't have a chance of winning the Oscar against Julia Roberts' Erin Brockovich, but her luminous performance is certainly of that caliber, while Mark Ruffalo projects belligerence, vulnerability and tenderness with effortless mastery. Matthew Broderick and Kenneth Lonergan himself provide sharp, amusing portraits of Linney's annoying boss and broad-minded pastor, respectively.

It is a simple story--the loser brother returns to town to his hometown that he ditched after his parents died.  He goes to stay with his divorced, uptight sister and her young son.  Chaos and conflict ensue due to their differing personality styles.But the script and direction (both by Ken Lonergan, who appears in the film in the small, very funny role of the priest who Sammy consults) are touching, funny, and thoughtful.  This, in my opinion, should have taken the Oscar for best original screenplay (which went to &quot;Traffic&quot;).  The Oscar, too, could deservedly have gone to Laura Linney, whose Sammy is a character study in small gestures, well-timed lines and naturalistic acting.Credit, too, should go to Mark Ruffalo as the brother and the actor (one of the Culkin clan) that plays Sammy's young son.Touching without being maudlin or sentimental, laugh-out-loud funny, and well crafted in every way.  This small movie tells a small, very human story in the very best way--that's the highest praise that I can give.

This is obviously not a typical Hollywood picture and surely not for everyone, but definitely one to see for anyone who appreciates superior character studies, feels confused, overwhelmed or bored about their own life, and is curious about the familial foundation which supports this entire movie. This isn't a very upbeat film. It does contain a handful of lighter moments, but is basically a movie that feels sort of somber all the way through but doesn't ever really get boring. The force of the writing is the main reason for that, with the superior performances set forth by all, straddling in as a close second. Major kudos go out to Mark Ruffalo, who completely inhabits his role as the loose younger brother with the knack for getting into trouble, as well as Laura Linney, playing the full role of mother, sister, lover and employee to a tee.

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","At the beginning of ""You Can Count on Me"" there is a 1982 car accident in a small town in upstate New York that orphans a young girl and boy.  We then jump ahead to the present where the two kids are now adults.  Samantha Prescott (Laura Linney) is the single mother of young 8-year-old Rudy (Rory Culkin), and her bother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) is back in town, not so much for a visit as in need of money.  Samantha's life is also complicated by a couple of other men, her boyfriend, Bob Steegerson (Jon Tenney), and Brian Everett (Matthew Broderick), the new manager at the bank where she is a loan officer.  Bob is interested in getting married and Brian likes lots of paperwork but does not like certain colors on the computers at the bank and the fact that Samantha takes 15 minutes each afternoon to pick Rudy up from school and take him to a sitter's house.  She thinks that with Terry back in town he might be able to help, but his presence is most assuredly a mixed blessing.We do not really find out a lot about what happened in the period in between, but we can hazard some guesses.  It might be a bit simplistic, but clearly Terry has never really grown up after his traumatic childhood and is still the bratty kid brother out to get his older sister.  Consequently he is able to relate to Rudy in ways that are a true revelation to the young boy and they have a series of uneven adventures.  Going to the local pool hall works out but taking Rudy to meet his father for the first time is a disaster.  We are not sure what Rudy thinks about the roller coaster ride with his Uncle Terry, but Samantha is not at all happy.  She has enough complications in her life what with Tom talking about marriage and the friction with Brian at work has turned into a torrid little affair.Writer-director Kenneth Lonergan's film is clearly driven by character more than by plot.  Apparently he began with the idea of a conversation between a brother and sister, and kept adding things for them to talk about.  The script was clearly good enough to attract a couple of major acting talents in Linney and Ruffalo, and have Broderick be content to play a choice little supporting role.  Even Rory Caulkin manages to play his role without channeling the worst acting traits of his older siblings.  But the film comes back to Linney and Ruffalo and the earnest portrayal of siblings that they provide.  ""You Can Count On Me"" is not a great film, but rather a solid film (which counts for a lot given the competition) that is well performed and Lonergan mixes the drama with some slightly skewed comedy that I found engaging.  We know that Terry has come home before and you have to think that one day he will return to visit Samantha and Rudy again.  The best thing I can say for this 2000 film is that even while we are thinking through what happened this time, we are wondering about the next visit as well.",5,Terry comes home to visit his sister Samantha and her son,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,2900,"['beginning', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', '1982', 'car', 'accident', 'small', 'town', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'young', 'girl', 'boy', 'then', 'jump', 'ahead', 'present', 'where', 'two', 'kids', 'are', 'now', 'adults', 'Samantha', 'Prescott', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'single', 'mother', 'young', '8-year-old', 'Rudy', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'bother', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'back', 'town', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'visit', 'need', 'money', 'Samantha', 'life', 'also', 'complicated', 'couple', 'other', 'men', 'boyfriend', 'Bob', 'Steegerson', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'Brian', 'Everett', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'new', 'manager', 'bank', 'where', 'loan', 'officer', 'Bob', 'interested', 'getting', 'married', 'Brian', 'lots', 'paperwork', 'not', 'like', 'certain', 'colors', 'computers', 'bank', 'fact', 'Samantha', '15', 'minutes', 'afternoon', 'pick', 'Rudy', 'up', 'school', 'take', 'sitter', 'house', 'Terry', 'back', 'town', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'help', 'presence', 'most', 'assuredly', 'mixed', 'blessing.We', 'do', 'not', 'really', 'find', 'out', 'lot', 'what', 'happened', 'period', 'can', 'hazard', 'guesses', 'might', 'be', 'bit', 'simplistic', 'clearly', 'Terry', 'never', 'really', 'grown', 'up', 'traumatic', 'childhood', 'still', 'bratty', 'kid', 'brother', 'get', 'older', 'sister', 'Consequently', 'able', 'relate', 'Rudy', 'ways', 'are', 'true', 'revelation', 'young', 'boy', 'have', 'series', 'uneven', 'adventures', 'Going', 'local', 'pool', 'hall', 'out', 'taking', 'Rudy', 'meet', 'father', 'first', 'time', 'disaster', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'Rudy', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'Uncle', 'Terry', 'Samantha', 'not', 'happy', 'enough', 'complications', 'life', 'what', 'Tom', 'talking', 'marriage', 'friction', 'Brian', 'work', 'turned', 'torrid', 'little', 'affair.Writer-director', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'film', 'clearly', 'driven', 'character', 'more', 'plot', 'Apparently', 'began', 'idea', 'conversation', 'brother', 'sister', 'kept', 'adding', 'things', 'talk', 'script', 'was', 'clearly', 'good', 'enough', 'attract', 'couple', 'major', 'acting', 'talents', 'Linney', 'Ruffalo', 'have', 'Broderick', 'be', 'content', 'play', 'choice', 'little', 'supporting', 'role', 'Even', 'Rory', 'Caulkin', 'play', 'role', 'channeling', 'worst', 'acting', 'traits', 'older', 'siblings', 'film', 'back', 'Linney', 'Ruffalo', 'earnest', 'portrayal', 'siblings', 'provide', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'rather', 'solid', 'film', 'lot', 'given', 'competition', 'well', 'performed', 'Lonergan', 'mixes', 'drama', 'slightly', 'skewed', 'comedy', 'found', 'engaging', 'know', 'Terry', 'come', 'home', 'have', 'think', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'return', 'visit', 'Samantha', 'Rudy', 'again', 'best', 'thing', 'can', 'say', '2000', 'film', 'even', 'are', 'thinking', 'what', 'happened', 'time', 'are', 'wondering', 'next', 'visit', 'as', 'well']",N/A

Laura Tinney gives a strong, well nuanced performance as Sammy, the put upon single parent of an eight year old boy. Jon Tenney gives a compelling portrayal as Tinney's stalwart, though dull, suitor. Matthew Broderick is terrific as Tinney's officious, insecure new boss with whom she ends up having a passionate affair.

Rory Culkin is wonderful as Tinney's quiet little boy, who believes his long missing father to be much more that he actually is.The story takes place in a rural locale. The opening scene shows a car accident in which a man and a woman are killed. The next scene shows a law enforcement officer breaking the news of their deaths to a young girl who is babysitting her younger brother. The movie now goes forward in time.

In ""You Can Count on Me"" we meet real people - people whose lives aren't perfect, whose dreams aren't fancy, and who make mistakes.  Nominated for two academy awards in 2000, this can be called a story about relationships.  But before you roll your eyes in boredom, thinking this might be too talky, and full of pat psychological answers to every question, just wait.  Even if easy answers are not forthcoming, you'll get a chance to glimpse some characters that are so real they could be the neighbors next door or members of your own family.The key relationship here is between a brother and a sister.  Orphaned as children, they've grown up counting on each other.  Now they are in their thirties.  The sister, Laura Linney, is a single mother of an 8-year-old boy, played by Rory Culkin.  She works in a bank in their hometown in Upstate New York, and has made arrangements with her boss to use part of her lunch hour time to pick up her child from school and bring him to a baby sitter.  The brother, played by Mark Ruffalo, has left home years before.  He's a drifter who always needs money, impulsive and boyish and loveable all at the same time.  His young nephew adores him, especially when he takes him to a pool hall one night.The sister has stuff to contend with. There's a new branch manager Matthew Broderick, where she works, the kind of idiot boss who forces the staff to refrain from using bright colors on their computer screens because it doesn't represent the dignity of a bank.  There's her son wanting to know more about his real father than she wants to tell him.  And there's a marriage proposal from her long-term boring boyfriend.  The brother's arrival is a catalyst for turmoil.  How it all plays out is real.Kenneth Lonergan wrote, directed and even plays a small part of a minister.  He's a master of understatement and accuracy of landscape as well as emotions.  It's like he just stood back and let the characters drive the plot.  It seems simple.  It isn't.

Eskildson ""Pragmatist""","[3, 3]","""You Can Count On Me"" was made in 2000 and is pleasing to watch and be drawn in,  It is about two siblings that are as different as night and day, but deeply connected through a tragic loss of their parents as children.  Sammy (Laura Linny) was always there for her rebellious younger brother Terry (Mark Fuffalo).  Overall there is an interesting story, but the movie is primarily a character study of the conservative, single mother Sammy and her drifter brother Terry.Sammy works as a lending officer at a small bank in Scottsdale, New York, the quiet hometown she was born and raised in.  Terry sends her a letter that he will be visiting her after six months of not hearing anything from him and two years since the last visit.  Terry is desperate for money and visits her and his nephew Rudy who are excited about seeing him again.  Terry asks Sammy for money to help his girlfriend, which he mails to her immediately.  However, when he calls to let her know the money is in the mail and he is returning, he finds out she attempted suicide so decides to stay longer than he planned.  He forms a friendship with Rudy who is curious about his father, since Sammy only gives him vague and brief descriptions.  They try new things together and face some facts of life about Rudy's run-a-way father.While Terry and Rudy are spending time together, Sammy rekindles her relationship with an old boyfriend, who proposes to her after a short time.  She also starts a fling with her married boss, who has a pregnant wife.  Things liven up during the time Terry is in town, but it begins to be too much for Sammy and there is discord between her and Terry.  Partly because she asks her minister to give Terry advice he did not ask for and his unreliable ways.Terry and Rudy have grown closer and after a day of fishing, but he pushes his sister's limits with a visit to Rudy, Senior in Auburn who becomes upset and a fight ensues.  Terry gets arrested but no charges are filed so he returns home to his sister, Sammy.  Sammy is upset and asks him to move out, which he does the next day.At first the separation is heart-wrenching.  They love each other but are entirely different in their outlook on life.  Finally, before Terry gets back on the bus, they reconcile, realizing they have deep, loving roots, but accept that they understand each other's life styles.""You Can Count On Me"" draws you in and keeps you interested because of the touching sweet honesty of the story and amazing actors doing their best work.",4,Touching Honesty -,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2511,"['Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'was', 'made', '2000', 'pleasing', 'watch', 'be', 'drawn', 'two', 'siblings', 'are', 'as', 'different', 'night', 'day', 'deeply', 'connected', 'tragic', 'loss', 'parents', 'children', 'Sammy', 'Laura', 'Linny', 'was', 'always', 'there', 'rebellious', 'younger', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Fuffalo', 'interesting', 'story', 'movie', 'primarily', 'character', 'study', 'conservative', 'single', 'mother', 'Sammy', 'drifter', 'brother', 'Terry.Sammy', 'lending', 'officer', 'small', 'bank', 'Scottsdale', 'New', 'York', 'quiet', 'hometown', 'was', 'born', 'raised', 'Terry', 'letter', 'will', 'be', 'visiting', 'six', 'months', 'not', 'hearing', 'anything', 'two', 'years', 'last', 'visit', 'Terry', 'desperate', 'money', 'nephew', 'Rudy', 'who', 'are', 'excited', 'seeing', 'again', 'Terry', 'Sammy', 'money', 'help', 'girlfriend', 'immediately', 'However', 'when', 'let', 'know', 'money', 'mail', 'returning', 'out', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'so', 'stay', 'longer', 'planned', 'friendship', 'Rudy', 'who', 'curious', 'father', 'Sammy', 'only', 'vague', 'brief', 'descriptions', 'try', 'new', 'things', 'together', 'face', 'facts', 'life', 'Rudy', 'run-a-way', 'father.While', 'Terry', 'Rudy', 'are', 'spending', 'time', 'together', 'Sammy', 'relationship', 'old', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'short', 'time', 'also', 'fling', 'married', 'boss', 'who', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'Things', 'liven', 'up', 'time', 'Terry', 'town', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'Sammy', 'discord', 'Terry', 'Partly', 'minister', 'give', 'Terry', 'advice', 'did', 'not', 'ask', 'unreliable', 'ways.Terry', 'Rudy', 'have', 'grown', 'closer', 'day', 'fishing', 'sister', 'limits', 'visit', 'Rudy', 'Senior', 'Auburn', 'who', 'upset', 'fight', 'ensues', 'Terry', 'arrested', 'charges', 'are', 'filed', 'so', 'home', 'sister', 'Sammy', 'Sammy', 'upset', 'move', 'out', 'next', 'day.At', 'first', 'separation', 'heart-wrenching', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'entirely', 'different', 'outlook', 'life', 'Finally', 'Terry', 'back', 'bus', 'reconcile', 'realizing', 'have', 'deep', 'loving', 'roots', 'accept', 'understand', 'other', 'life', 'styles', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'draws', 'keeps', 'interested', 'touching', 'sweet', 'honesty', 'story', 'amazing', 'actors', 'doing', 'best', 'work']",N/A

132958,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792175220,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","We have become so used to the loud, high tech movies that Hollywood cranks out these days that when a quiet, gentle, story-driven movie like You Can Count on Me comes along, we don't know quite what to make of it.We have come to expect our movies to be full of explosions, horrific images and people doing the most outrageous things to each other. This film begins with a car wreck, but it is shown in the most minimal way. A couple is driving down a two-lane road at night. A pickup truck starts to back out of a driveway. When the man swerves to avoid it, a speeding track trailer appears in the oncoming lane. We see the couples faces, and then the screen goes black. In the next scene, we see a state trooper knocking on the couple's front door. A baby-sitter opens the door, and in the background, we see a girl and boy watching TV. They are about to find out that they've just become orphans. Initially, I thought the movie was simply too low-budget for its makers to afford a big car wreck. Then I realized that director Kenneth Lonergan had no interest in pumping up our adrenaline. He simply had a story to tell about a brother and a sister and how they related to the world, to themselves and to each other.It is eighteen years later, and the brother and sister are all grown up. Samantha [Laura Linney] has remained in her upstate New York home town. She has a kid named Rudy [Rory Culkin] and a decent job as a loan officer in a local bank. She's a single Mom, having divorced her lout of a husband when Rudy was an infant. She seems to be dependable and perhaps too content with her rather dull life. Rudy is a great kid but seems to miss a male influence in his life. The brother, Brian [Mark Ruffalo], has taken a different road in life. He is restless and moves around a lot. He's lived everywhere from Florida to Alaska. He's not sure that his life is worth very much, but he keeps on trying to find some purpose and meaning. One day Samantha receives a letter from him. He's coming to visit, and she is thrilled. His visit will prove to be an eye-opener for them, as well as for Rudy.Unlike most movies, You Can Count on Me does not build up to one or more life-shattering events. It starts with one - the sudden death of the parents. It then assumes that we are adult enough to know that such an occurrence changes people. Samantha and Brian never make direct reference to the accident, but everywhere their parent seem to lurk in the background. Samantha still lives in her parents' house. The first thing Brian see when he comes home is the cemetery. Samantha's clinging to security and Brian's rootlessness are simply different reactions to the same tragic event.I don't think I have ever seen a movie that more realistically shows the relationship between a brother and a sister or between a fatherless child and his loving but irresponsible uncle. Part of the reason is the script and the direction. The rest of it is the acting by Linney, Ruffalo and Culkin. Each gives his or her character a memorable life of its own. Linney received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress, but I found Ruffalo's performance to be at least the equal of hers.This is reflective movie, but it is never moody. These characters face obstacles, deal with them and move on, which I think is typical of many people. You Can Count on Me is done on a very human scale, and for those wanting a lot of action, it is not recommended. Everyone else should enjoy it.",4,"Sensitive, intelligent, very human film",1016150400,"03 15, 2002",2002,3460,"['have', 'become', 'so', 'used', 'loud', 'high', 'tech', 'movies', 'Hollywood', 'out', 'days', 'when', 'quiet', 'gentle', 'story-driven', 'movie', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'along', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'make', 'it.We', 'have', 'come', 'expect', 'movies', 'be', 'full', 'explosions', 'horrific', 'images', 'people', 'doing', 'most', 'outrageous', 'things', 'other', 'film', 'car', 'wreck', 'shown', 'most', 'minimal', 'way', 'couple', 'driving', 'down', 'two-lane', 'road', 'night', 'A', 'pickup', 'truck', 'back', 'driveway', 'When', 'man', 'avoid', 'speeding', 'track', 'trailer', 'oncoming', 'lane', 'see', 'couples', 'then', 'screen', 'black', 'next', 'scene', 'see', 'state', 'trooper', 'knocking', 'couple', 'front', 'door', 'baby-sitter', 'door', 'background', 'see', 'girl', 'boy', 'watching', 'TV', 'are', 'find', 'out', ""'ve"", 'just', 'become', 'orphans', 'Initially', 'thought', 'movie', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'low-budget', 'makers', 'afford', 'big', 'car', 'wreck', 'Then', 'realized', 'director', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'had', 'interest', 'pumping', 'up', 'adrenaline', 'simply', 'had', 'story', 'tell', 'brother', 'sister', 'how', 'related', 'world', 'other.It', 'eighteen', 'years', 'later', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'grown', 'up', 'Samantha', '[', 'Laura', 'Linney', ']', 'remained', 'upstate', 'New', 'York', 'home', 'town', 'kid', 'named', 'Rudy', '[', 'Rory', 'Culkin', ']', 'decent', 'job', 'loan', 'officer', 'local', 'bank', 'single', 'Mom', 'having', 'divorced', 'lout', 'husband', 'when', 'Rudy', 'was', 'infant', 'be', 'dependable', 'perhaps', 'too', 'content', 'rather', 'dull', 'life', 'Rudy', 'great', 'kid', 'miss', 'male', 'influence', 'life', 'brother', 'Brian', '[', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', ']', 'taken', 'different', 'road', 'life', 'restless', 'around', 'lot', 'lived', 'everywhere', 'Florida', 'Alaska', 'not', 'sure', 'life', 'worth', 'very', 'much', 'trying', 'find', 'purpose', 'meaning', 'One', 'day', 'Samantha', 'letter', 'coming', 'visit', 'thrilled', 'visit', 'will', 'prove', 'be', 'eye-opener', 'as', 'well', 'Rudy.Unlike', 'most', 'movies', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'not', 'build', 'up', 'one', 'more', 'life-shattering', 'events', 'one', 'sudden', 'death', 'parents', 'then', 'are', 'adult', 'enough', 'know', 'such', 'occurrence', 'changes', 'people', 'Samantha', 'Brian', 'never', 'make', 'direct', 'reference', 'accident', 'everywhere', 'parent', 'seem', 'lurk', 'background', 'Samantha', 'still', 'parents', 'house', 'first', 'thing', 'Brian', 'see', 'when', 'home', 'cemetery', 'Samantha', 'clinging', 'security', 'Brian', 'rootlessness', 'are', 'simply', 'different', 'reactions', 'same', 'tragic', 'event.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'more', 'realistically', 'relationship', 'brother', 'sister', 'fatherless', 'child', 'loving', 'irresponsible', 'uncle', 'Part', 'reason', 'script', 'direction', 'rest', 'acting', 'Linney', 'Ruffalo', 'Culkin', 'character', 'memorable', 'life', 'own', 'Linney', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Actress', 'found', 'Ruffalo', 'performance', 'be', 'least', 'equal', 'hers.This', 'reflective', 'movie', 'never', 'moody', 'characters', 'face', 'obstacles', 'deal', 'move', 'think', 'typical', 'many', 'people', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'done', 'very', 'human', 'scale', 'wanting', 'lot', 'action', 'not', 'recommended', 'Everyone', 'else', 'should', 'enjoy']",N/A

Crammer,"[4, 5]","This is one of the best films I've seen in quite a while -- beautifully written, acted, and directed -- and to top it off, there's a beautiful Catskills setting.  This is a film about family relationships, but not one of those unpleasant films where people spend two hours fighting on screen and  you end up not liking anyone.  Instead, these are three dimensional people in a three dimensional family -- you get both the good and the bad from both.The story begins when a couple are killed in a car accident, leaving two children orphaned. This is the pivotal event in the lives of these two characters. We are never told who raises the children we see crying at the funeral, but the story shifts to perhaps 20 years later.Each of the orphans has their own struggles -- Laura Linney's character, Sammy, is a single mother with an 8 year old son who is living in the family home and working as a loan officer in the small town bank.  Matthew Broderick plays her new boss -- a thorough cad (and his role is comparatively minor).  Sammy's brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) comes to visit her, basically to borrow money but also because his own life is once more falling apart. He is a charming ne'er do well.  His sister Sammy appears to have her life together, but it becomes apparent that she's not doing as well as she appears to be.  Terry ends up connecting with Sammy's son Rudy (played by Rory Culkin), which is both good and bad, because of Terry's personality (as noted previously, he's a charming ne'er do well -- Rudy is attracted to him but can Terry be trusted not to be a bad influence?).  Despite all their failings, you end up liking most of the characters in this film and know that despite it all, this family has love.This is the kind of movie that you want to listen to the director's commentary on -- and I don't know why it didn't win an Oscar for the best screenplay.",5,An outstanding film -- I don't know why it's not better known,1134345600,"12 12, 2005",2005,1883,"['one', 'best', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'beautifully', 'written', 'acted', 'directed', 'top', 'off', 'beautiful', 'Catskills', 'setting', 'film', 'family', 'relationships', 'not', 'one', 'unpleasant', 'films', 'where', 'people', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'fighting', 'screen', 'end', 'up', 'not', 'liking', 'anyone', 'Instead', 'are', 'three', 'dimensional', 'people', 'three', 'dimensional', 'family', 'get', 'good', 'bad', 'both.The', 'story', 'when', 'couple', 'are', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'leaving', 'two', 'children', 'orphaned', 'pivotal', 'event', 'lives', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'never', 'told', 'who', 'children', 'see', 'crying', 'funeral', 'story', 'shifts', 'perhaps', '20', 'years', 'later.Each', 'orphans', 'own', 'struggles', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'character', 'Sammy', 'single', 'mother', '8', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'who', 'living', 'family', 'home', 'working', 'loan', 'officer', 'small', 'town', 'bank', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'new', 'boss', 'thorough', 'cad', 'role', 'comparatively', 'minor', 'Sammy', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'visit', 'basically', 'borrow', 'money', 'also', 'own', 'life', 'once', 'more', 'falling', 'apart', 'charming', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'sister', 'Sammy', 'have', 'life', 'together', 'apparent', 'not', 'doing', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Terry', 'up', 'connecting', 'Sammy', 'son', 'Rudy', 'played', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'good', 'bad', 'Terry', 'personality', 'noted', 'previously', 'charming', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'Rudy', 'attracted', 'can', 'Terry', 'be', 'trusted', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'influence', 'failings', 'end', 'up', 'liking', 'most', 'characters', 'film', 'know', 'family', 'love.This', 'kind', 'movie', 'want', 'listen', 'director', 'commentary', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Oscar', 'best', 'screenplay']",N/A

Whether rambling through the jungles in the ridiculous CONGO, or teaming with Richard Gere in both PRIMAL FEAR and MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, or exploding the screen with her small but monumental performance in MYSTIC RIVER, she lights the screen with her downhome loveliness, and what's more, her on-target realistic performances.  It's like she's not acting at all.She brings this luminescence to her Oscar nominated performance in YOU CAN COUNT ON ME, Kenneth Lonergan's tidy little slice of life that has no real huge plot...but just shows us quite realistically the relationship between a woman and her ne'er do well brother; how his sudden reappearance in her life affects her eight year old son, and even herself as she juggles a romance with a dependable, if nonexciting beau, and her new boss at the bank, who is both married and a father to be.Along with Linney's wonderful performance, she is joined by a very excellent cast: Mark Ruffalo (Last Castle, 13 Going on 30) shines as her brother, Terry, an immature young man going through life without real purpose, or goals.  Terry, however, is a sensitive young man, and sincere in his relationship with Linney's young son.  Rory Culkin as that young son, is marvelous in his normal performance.  He seems like he is Linney's son and his questioning eyes and obvious hurt of not being loved by his scumbag father are key to the plot's development.  Matthew Broderick portrays the stuffy, staid bank manager who beds Linney in a passionate search for real love or something close.  Once you meet his pregnant wife, you'll see why he jumps into the sack with Linney.  Jon Tenney as Linney's current boyfriend, Bob, is marvelous too as he shows what a dependable, loving and sincere lover he is to Linney; she won't marry him, though, probably because he's too reserved, maybe even boring.  But his performance is quiet, controlled and makes one wish he'd open up more and have fun with his life.That may be Lonergan's ultimate message..life is something to be cherished, no matter where you live or how you live it, just cherish it and enjoy it.A marvelously low key film that is one of the best of this type.",5,THE LOVELY LAURA,1093824000,"08 30, 2004",2004,2244,"['Laura', 'Linney', 'one', 'most', 'gifted', 'yet', 'lowkey', 'screens', 'today', 'rambling', 'jungles', 'ridiculous', 'CONGO', 'teaming', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'PRIMAL', 'FEAR', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'exploding', 'screen', 'small', 'monumental', 'performance', 'MYSTIC', 'RIVER', 'lights', 'screen', 'downhome', 'loveliness', 'what', 'more', 'on-target', 'realistic', 'performances', 'not', 'acting', 'all.She', 'brings', 'luminescence', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'performance', 'YOU', 'CAN', 'COUNT', 'ON', 'ME', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', 'tidy', 'little', 'slice', 'life', 'real', 'huge', 'plot', 'just', 'quite', 'realistically', 'relationship', 'woman', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'brother', 'how', 'sudden', 'reappearance', 'life', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'even', 'romance', 'dependable', 'nonexciting', 'beau', 'new', 'boss', 'bank', 'who', 'married', 'father', 'be.Along', 'Linney', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'joined', 'very', 'excellent', 'cast', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Last', 'Castle', '13', 'Going', '30', 'shines', 'brother', 'Terry', 'immature', 'young', 'man', 'going', 'life', 'real', 'purpose', 'goals', 'Terry', 'however', 'sensitive', 'young', 'man', 'sincere', 'relationship', 'Linney', 'young', 'son', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'young', 'son', 'marvelous', 'normal', 'performance', 'Linney', 'son', 'questioning', 'eyes', 'obvious', 'hurt', 'not', 'being', 'loved', 'scumbag', 'father', 'are', 'key', 'plot', 'development', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'stuffy', 'staid', 'bank', 'manager', 'who', 'Linney', 'passionate', 'search', 'real', 'love', 'something', 'close', 'meet', 'pregnant', 'wife', ""'ll"", 'see', 'why', 'sack', 'Linney', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'Linney', 'current', 'boyfriend', 'Bob', 'marvelous', 'too', 'what', 'dependable', 'loving', 'sincere', 'lover', 'Linney', 'wo', ""n't"", 'marry', 'though', 'probably', 'too', 'reserved', 'maybe', 'even', 'boring', 'performance', 'quiet', 'controlled', 'one', 'wish', ""'d"", 'open', 'up', 'more', 'have', 'fun', 'life.That', 'may', 'be', 'Lonergan', 'ultimate', 'message..life', 'something', 'be', 'cherished', 'matter', 'where', 'live', 'how', 'live', 'just', 'cherish', 'enjoy', 'it.A', 'marvelously', 'low', 'key', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'type']",N/A
132962,A3QZCA4LTTVGAD,0792175220,Michael J. Mazza,"[40, 42]","I am glad that &quot;You Can Count on Me,&quot; the wonderful film written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, was given a higher profile in the wake of its Academy Award nominations. This is a classic &quot;small&quot; film: it takes place entirely in or around a small town, and focuses on a small group of ordinary people. But the emotions of this film are powerful, the story is relevant, and Lonergan gets outstanding performances from a wonderful cast.Laura Linney plays Sammy, a single mother and bank employee. When her troubled brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) returns to town, Sammy's life and relationship with her young son (Rory Culkin) become complicated by Terry's influence. Sammy has to juggle this domestic situation with controversy at work, where her anal-retentive boss (Matthew Broderick) is making lives miserable.The story sounds simple, but Lonergan's intelligent script really brings us into the lives of these characters. And the performances truly make this film worth seeing. Linney carries the lead role with passionate grace, and has great chemistry with her screen brother Ruffalo. Broderick delivers a wonderfully multilayered performance as a character who is at times pathetic, at times sympathetic, and at times downright infuriating. And Culkin is a revelation as the young son; this is one of the best performances by a child actor that I have ever seen.&quot;You Can Count on Me&quot; deals insightfully with a number of relationships: mother/son, brother/sister, boss/employee, pastor/churchgoer, and more. Lonergan deftly blends moments of both heartbreak and hilarity into a richly satisfying whole.

132965,A27PSZX2SE0B51,0792175220,Mike Stone,"[7, 8]","The first time I saw it, &quot;You Can Count On Me&quot; seemed to whisper along quietly, content to make small statements about small people, but never really hitting the emotional home run that it really should have.  I found the actors intriguing in their portrayals of an odd family with an odd dynamic, but not world-beating in any way.  And I just didn't get what all the hype was about regarding the talents of the new writer/director Kenneth Lonergan.  His work was fine and good, but nothing to write home about.  That was the first time.  The second time I saw it I was crushed. By the technical virtuosity of Lonergan's writing, his subtle but effective direction, the powerful performances of his actors, and the brutal honesty of the movie's emotional content.Laura Linney plays Sammy: older sister, mom, rock.  She never left her home town, and lives in the house where she grew up, orphaned after her parents died in a car wreck.  She has a son from a failed marriage, and a stable job down at the bank.  Rory Culkin plays Rudy, her son, a quiet but intelligent 8-year old.  And Mark Ruffalo plays Terry, Sammy's drifter brother, who seems to have taken a more destructive path after their parents' death.Essentially a low-key family drama, the film draws its powers from depicting how each character differs depending on who they're relating to at a given moment.Sammy and Terry's relationship forms the backbone of the movie.  Terry, home just to borrow money from his more stable sis, feels threatened by her normalcy, and just wants to get on with his nomadic life.  He is easily angered by Sammy, who's only looking out for his best interests.  But he is also totally in awe of her.  Sammy, for her part, is flabbergasted by her brother's chosen lifestyle, but also in a way envious of it.  Their paradoxical relationship is perfectly summarized by a quiet scene on the porch, where one minute Sammy is angry at Terry's imperfections, but then admits to a few indiscretions of her own.  All this over a joint.  It's a wonderful way of showing the breadth of the relationship between these two adults, how they were once stupid kids together and can't quite seem to grow out of that.  Linney, I think, has the toughest acting role here.  She is asked to play a conservative mom with a hidden wild streak.  You have to believe that these two opposing forces could exist within one woman, and Linney makes you do just that.Sammy's relationship with her son Rudy is typical mom and son stuff, but it also has the capacity to surprise.  This is especially true in the moments when Rudy brings up his father.  He's idealized this man he's never met, and Sammy is tormented over how much to tell the boy, and over how much he already knows.  Culkin exhibits none of the histrionic tendencies that his older brother did at this age.  Instead, he is quiet, direct, and economical.  And his eyes show a true level of inquisitiveness that is difficult for actors his age.Rudy and Terry's relationship, nephew and long-lost uncle, highlights some of my favourite moments from the film.  Terry, essentially a selfish loner, tries his darndest to be the older brother figure he thinks Rudy needs.  He does his best to confound everyone's expectations of him (when picking up Rudy from school, Rudy -- and the audience -- first think Terry's forgotten.  But then he turns around to see Terry grinning by the car.  &quot;You showed up,&quot; says Rudy.  &quot;Looks that way,&quot; Terry replies, proud as punch).  Most of the time his intentions are good, but they cause more trouble than he expected.  My favourite scene has Terry taking Rudy to a pool hall.  Terry clears the table, but intentionally misses the 8-ball, leaving Rudy with an easy shot so they boy can enjoy their joint win in style.  But should the 8-year old boy really have spent any time in the pool hall?  Sammy surely doesn't think so.  These are the scenes where Ruffalo truly shines.  He is able to play boyish charm, protective uncle and repressed loner all at once, and he does it with an off-beat vocal drawl that draws you closer to Terry, even though you should know better.I'll quickly mention that I enjoyed Matthew Broderick's further distancing of himself from his Ferris Bueller persona, in an effective performance as a stuffy bank manager who disrupts Sammy's working life (&quot;I like paper work,&quot; he says.  Ew).  And Lonergan himself plays the family priest.  Although it's a role that's too wordy by half (especially in comparison to the rest of the economic script) Lonergan's banal delivery makes this modern holy man all the more real.Lonergan, behind the camera, shows us just what we need to see in order to follow along with the story.  It never feels like you're having situations explained to you, but rather like you're eavesdropping on people's lives, which is the mark of a good screenwriter.  He accomplishes this by entering and leaving scenes at the latest and earliest possible moment.  Witness the opening scene, when a cop shows up at the Prescott home with the news that Sammy and Terry's parents are dead.  We see the cop's anguish when confronted with the children's babysitter, but we never hear him tell the horrible news.  Doesn't matter.  We all know what's happened, and any cheesy line Lonergan could have come up with would not have been as powerful as the look on the cop's face.The same could be said for the movie's last line.  Actually, it's the last line that's never said.  You know it.  I know it.  It's the title of the movie, for godsakes!  But Lonergan, a director/writer in full control of his craft, knows that saying it aloud would be maudlin.  Having everyone in the audience fill in the blank creates a strong moment.  It's a classy way to end a really effective little movie.",5,A little film that rewards multiple viewings,1003968000,"10 25, 2001",2001,5819,"['first', 'time', 'saw', 'quot', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me',

132966,A3NCIN6TNL0MGA,0792175220,"M. JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[6, 7]","One of the most compelling events of the release of Kenneth Lonergan's You Can Count On Me is that it gave visibility to Mark Ruffalo who plays a troubled young man who, unable to deal with the childhood trauma of having lost his parents to a car crash, lives of life of unattached agony and isolation. He's a loner and a drifter, medicating his self-pity with pot and short-lived relationships. His sister Sammy, played wonderfully by Laura Linney, reacts to the same tragedy by being, in many ways, an overresponsible overcontrolling super mom. Two opposite reactions to the same tragedy of course result in a sibling clash. This film shows with great complexity and biting comic insight, the attempt of this brother and sister to shed their defense mechanisms and most importantly reconnect with one another. The ride is never easy in this film. No easy answers are given. Just as important, this film, which deals with the pain of loss, never descends into the maudlin Hallmark movie sap that other films would. Balancing edgy humor and profound psychological insight, Lonergan has written and directed a tale that captures the layers upon layers of psychological complexity that accompany the trauma of loss. Amazingly, he does it in a fast-paced film with scenes that are by turns comic and dramatic. Matthew Broderick, for example, plays a hilarious role of Sammy's neurotic anal-retentive boss at the bank. The conflict between him and Sammy leads to a plot point that I'll let you discover in the film.But most of all, this film shines because Mark Ruffalo plays such an endearing, sympathetic, sometimes infuriating character.

The story focuses on Samantha ""Sammy"" Prescott (Laura Linney), a single mother living in a small town in New York State, who has worked at the same bank for seven years while raising her son, Rudy (Rory Culkin), on her own.  Then one day her brother, Terry (Mark Ruffalo), whom she has not seen for sometime, shows up.  He moves in with Sammy and Rudy, and for awhile provides Sammy with some help, especially with Rudy; it's a welcome respite from juggling her work schedule and trying to do it all herself.  And it takes some of the pressure off, as her new boss, Brian Everett (Matthew Broderick), is a stickler who takes exception to Sammy having to leave early every day to pick up her son from school.  At about this same time, however, an on-again-off-again relationship Sammy has had with a man named Bob Stegerson (Jon Tenney) begins to get complicated, while the situation at home starts to tweak in the wake of some questionable decisions made by Terry that involve Rudy.  And-- as if all that weren't enough-- inexplicably, at work sparks suddenly begin to fly between Sammy and Brian.Lonergan does an excellent job of bringing his story to life.  The Screenplay is well written and intelligent, and offers some real insight into the human condition by embracing the very flaws and foibles of which we are all endowed, and which we all must deal with in one way or another in our own lives.  It's an engrossing, emotionally gripping film that presents very real characters and situations, and one of it's strengths is in the honesty, of not only the actions, but the ""reactions"" of the people playing out the drama.  And it's that genuine sincerity at the core of the story that makes this film so effective and believable.  Well directed and acted, it's quite simply an affecting and memorable film.Laura Linney has never been better than she is here, and deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance as Sammy.  She has a thorough grasp of the character that makes her real-- this imperfect woman and mother coping with the stress in her life and just trying to do the best she can and what she thinks is right.  Her portrayal acknowledges Sammy's strengths and vulnerability, as well as the fact that people change and relationships evolve; that what may have been right for her a year ago isn't necessarily what she needs today.  Sammy is a complex character, and Linney convincingly takes her through a wide range of emotional levels that evokes empathy for her and makes her someone you care about.Terry is a complex character as well, a young man with a good heart, lacking perhaps some personal direction, but whose biggest fault may be that he cares too much and feels too deeply.  And Ruffalo plays him perfectly.  Like a young Brando, he hits every note just right in bringing Terry to life.  He has a natural, charismatic and extremely engaging screen presence, and he is absolutely terrific in this role.  He's a gifted actor from whom we can expect great things in the future.Also giving a solid performance is the always reliable Broderick, who admirably continues to take some career chances with roles such as this one, as he did with the part of the teacher, Jim McAllister, in ""Election.""  In both cases, they are ordinary yet flawed characters who are not necessarily ingratiating in any way, but as played by Broderick they are at least people to whom one can definitely relate.The supporting cast includes Ken Lonergan (Ron), Gaby Hoffman (Sheila), Kim Parker (Rudy Sr.'s Girlfriend) and Josh Lucas (Rudy Sr.).  With ""You Can Count On Me,"" Lonergan delivers a tender and poignant story with something of a wistful ending, the impact of which is enhanced by the very reality of it's characters and situations.  And there are humorous moments, as well, that evolve naturally from the story, just as they do in real life.  In the end, this is transporting drama with which many will be able to identify, for the roads it travels are the same ones many of those who see it will have been down themselves.",5,"Affecting, Transporting Drama",985824000,"03 29, 2001",2001,4242,"['Relationships', 'problems', 'faced', 'people', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'day', 'make', 'sense', 'lives', 'explored', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'written', 'directed', 'Ken', 'Lonergan', 'story', 'Samantha', 'Sammy', 'Prescott', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'single', 'mother', 'living', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'who', 'worked', 'same', 'bank', 'seven', 'years', 'raising', 'son', 'Rudy', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'own', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'brother', 'Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'whom', 'not', 'seen', 'sometime', 'up', 'Sammy', 'Rudy', 'awhile', 'Sammy', 'help', 'especially', 'Rudy', 'welcome', 'respite', 'juggling', 'work', 'schedule', 'trying', 'do', 'pressure', 'off', 'new', 'boss', 'Brian', 'Everett', 'Matthew', 'Broderick', 'stickler', 'who', 'exception', 'Sammy', 'having', 'leave', 'early', 'day', 'pick', 'up', 'son', 'school', 'same', 'time', 'however', 'on-again-off-again', 'relationship', 'Sammy', 'had', 'man', 'named', 'Bob', 'Stegerson', 'Jon', 'Tenney', 'get', 'complicated', 'situation', 'home', 'starts', 'tweak', 'wake', 'questionable', 'decisions', 'made', 'Terry', 'involve', 'Rudy', 'were', ""n't"", 'enough', 'inexplicably', 'work', 'sparks', 'suddenly', 'begin', 'fly', 'Sammy', 'Brian.Lonergan', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'life', 'Screenplay', 'well', 'written', 'intelligent', 'real', 'insight', 'human', 'condition', 'embracing', 'very', 'flaws', 'foibles', 'are', 'endowed', 'must', 'deal', 'one', 'way', 'own', 'lives', 'engrossing', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'film', 'very', 'real', 'characters', 'situations', 'one', 'strengths', 'honesty', 'not', 'only', 'actions', 'reactions', 'people', 'playing', 'out', 'drama', 'genuine', 'sincerity', 'core', 'story', 'film', 'so', 'effective', 'believable', 'Well', 'directed', 'acted', 'quite', 'simply', 'affecting', 'memorable', 'film.Laura', 'Linney', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'here', 'deservedly', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'performance', 'Sammy', 'thorough', 'grasp', 'character', 'real', 'imperfect', 'woman', 'mother', 'coping', 'stress', 'life', 'just', 'trying', 'do', 'best', 'can', 'what', 'right', 'portrayal', 'Sammy', 'strengths', 'vulnerability', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'people', 'change', 'relationships', 'evolve', 'what', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'right', 'year', 'ago', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'what', 'today', 'Sammy', 'complex', 'character', 'Linney', 'convincingly', 'wide', 'range', 'emotional', 'levels', 'empathy', 'someone', 'care', 'about.Terry', 'complex', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'young', 'man', 'good', 'heart', 'lacking', 'perhaps', 'personal', 'direction', 'biggest', 'fault', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'feels', 'too', 'deeply', 'Ruffalo', 'perfectly', 'young', 'Brando', 'note', 'just', 'right', 'bringing', 'Terry', 'life', 'natural', 'charismatic', 'extremely', 'engaging', 'screen', 'presence', 'absolutely', 'terrific', 'role', 'gifted', 'actor', 'whom', 'can', 'expect', 'great', 'things', 'future.Also', 'giving', 'solid', 'performance', 'always', 'reliable', 'Broderick', 'who', 'admirably', 'take', 'career', 'chances', 'roles', 'such', 'one', 'did', 'part', 'teacher', 'Jim', 'McAllister', 'Election', 'cases', 'are', 'ordinary', 'yet', 'flawed', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'necessarily', 'ingratiating', 'way', 'played', 'Broderick', 'are', 'least', 'people', 'whom', 'one', 'can', 'definitely', 'relate.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Ken', 'Lonergan', 'Ron', 'Gaby', 'Hoffman', 'Sheila', 'Kim', 'Parker', 'Rudy', 'Sr.', 'Girlfriend', 'Josh', 'Lucas', 'Rudy', 'Sr.', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'Lonergan', 'tender', 'poignant', 'story', 'something', 'wistful', 'ending', 'impact', 'enhanced', 'very', 'reality', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'humorous', 'moments', 'as', 'well', 'evolve', 'naturally', 'story', 'just', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'end', 'transporting', 'drama', 'many', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'identify', 'roads', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'many', 'who', 'see', 'will', 'have', 'been', 'down']",N/A

His script was nominated for an Academy Award, his first (he was also nominated two years later for Gangs of New York). His direction was not. The Academy goofed with the first, but not with the second.Sam Prescott (Tales of the City's Laura Linney) and her younger brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo, recently of Windtalkers) don't see each other much. Sam is a reporter with the paper in the same town where she and Terry grew up; Terry left town as soon as he could and has been kicking around the country ever since. Sam has a young son, Rudy (played by Rory, the newest member of the Culkin clan to try and make it big), by a man who up and disappeared soon after. So when Terry drops in looking for money, and crises occur where he used to live, the stage seems set up for Rudy to gain himself a surrogate father Terry-style. Add to this Sam's new micromanaging boss (Matthew Broderick), and you've got yourself a story that Oprah would use as a charter for Oprah's Movie Club, if she ever gets around to starting one.The main thing I kept thinking during this move is ""boy, Matthew Broderick's career has sure gone down the tubes recently."" First Election, then this? A few more dysfunction-of-the-week films and he'll become the first actor in Hollywood history to change his typecast halfway through his career. (He's in the upcoming remake of The Stepford Wives. Beware.) While the movie is well-enough acted, nothing much happens except the unraveling of an already-dysfunctional family. We haven't seen it enough, especially when there's nothing new added to it?The one gem about this movie is Rory Culkin, who's got more acting talent in his little finger than his two older brothers combined, and uses a good deal of it here. Of course, a Culkin clan member playing a dysfunctional kid is probably not that much of a stretch, but it's obvious he's already got a good grasp of timing, and has a chance to succeed while the others failed.So if you want to see Rory Culkin's big-screen debut, this is probably worth a rental.

132976,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0792175220,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 6]","****1/2 &#65533;You Can Count on Me&#65533; is a film made, miraculously, without a single false step.  In fact, more than any American movie of recent times, this film captures the feel and essence of life as we really live it.  Heartfelt kudos go out to writer/director Kenneth Lonergan for fashioning an intimate family drama that is totally devoid of both cheap sensationalism and phony melodramatics &#65533; a drama in which no character is a hero or a villain but simply an ordinary human being struggling to come to grips with this messy thing we call life.Set in a bucolic small town in rural New England, the film stars the luminous Laura Linney as Sammy Prescott, a single mother trying to instill in her eight-year old son a sense of decency and values.  Having lost their parents in a car crash at a very early age, Sammy and her siblings have obviously had to overcome any number of psychological and emotional obstacles on their way to adulthood &#65533; and no one seems to have been as adversely affected by the tragedy as Sammy&#65533;s younger brother, Terry, who, as an adult, has found himself drifting aimlessly from one location, job and relationship to another, completely lacking, as Sammy puts it, the &#65533;anchor&#65533; that holds most of our lives in place.  Sammy has found that anchor in the form of her son, her home, her church and her bank job, but when Terry suddenly returns for a visit and the bank hires a new, less-than-understanding manager (with whom she ends up having an affair), even Sammy discovers that the threads holding her own life together may be more tenuous and tangled than she originally imagined (she even discovers that her religion has begun to soft pedal sin at a time when she feels what she really needs is some good old-fashioned fire-and-brimstone exhortation).The beauty of Lonergan&#65533;s screenplay is that, while it throws any number of curve balls our way and never lets us know for sure where the story is headed, at the same time, it achieves that most remarkable feat of never forcing us to question its credibility.  Every action and reaction on the part of the characters is completely in-line with life as we know it.In fact, each character in the film is a true-to-life, recognizable human figure, neither villainous nor saintly.  Sammy is an obviously well-intentioned young woman, a hardworking churchgoer who is just trying to raise her son to be the best person possible given the often trying circumstances brought on by single motherhood.  Sammy is also deeply devoted to her wayward brother, struggling to find a way to offer him the love and encouragement she feels he needs without jeopardizing the physical and psychological well-being of herself and her son, Rudy.  Yet, despite the innate goodness at the core of her being, Sammy, like all us mere mortals, stumbles morally from time to time &#65533; most noticeably, in the unexpected affair she finds herself having with her new married boss (Matthew Broderick).  Suddenly, Sammy now has to cope with the paradoxical dilemma of trying to provide moral guidance for both her brother and her son, while she, herself, is violating the very foundation of her own code of ethics.Even more intriguing, perhaps, is the contradictory nature of Terry (played by Mark Ruffalo, who, I swear, sounds as if he had been dubbed by none other than John Travolta).  Here is a character who could so easily have slid over into the role of easy villain.  Instead, Lonergan has chosen to see him in three-dimensional terms, showing how many of his actions that wound and hurt those around him are the result far more of immaturity and a stunted emotional development than of outright greed, viciousness or malice.  Like a child, Terry seems unable to confront the root causes of his bitterness and anger, so he often takes out his frustration on people like Sammy and Rudy without thinking about the consequences until after he has performed the action.  Yet, there are any number of moments when Terry reaches out in a genuine way for love, forgiveness and understanding.  Because of the subtle duality of his nature, Terry is one of the most impressively realized characters I&#65533;ve seen in any film in a long, long time.Even the minor characters are expertly drawn.  As the philandering boss, Matthew Broderick makes us believe that much of his petty tyranny is really an attempt to hide the insecurity and unhappiness that is at the core of his personal life and being.  Even the almost comically tawdry affair that ensues between him and Sammy speaks volumes about the emptiness and confusion both of them feel deep inside.  Sammy&#65533;s sometime boyfriend, Bob, seems almost too good to be true at times, but even he is struggling with his own demons of indecisiveness and insecurity.The ultimate message of &#65533;You Can Count on Me&#65533; seems to be that, no matter how messed up our lives become, all we really have in the end is each other and that it is the duty of those of us who are coping the best to help bring along those near and dear to us who seem to be struggling the most.  In this instance, Kenneth Lonergan, by resisting the temptation to judge his characters or preach to his audience, has managed to create a film of great wisdom, perceptiveness and compassion.  It is truly a rare gem to be treasured.",4,outstanding drama,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,5362,"['****1/2', '65533', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', '65533', 'film', 'made', 'miraculously', 'single', 'false',

132977,A2GQOI25E6UY25,0792175220,RolloTomasi,"[14, 17]","When a movie takes on the most ordinary, potentially mundane of situations and turns it into an experience that is nothing less than wholly enthralling, you know you're in the presence of one of the year's very best films. Kenneth Lonergan's 'You Can Count On Me,' which along with Spike Jonze's 'Being John Malkovich' may be the most impressive directorial debut I've ever seen, is that kind of a movie. It starts from the most limited resources imaginable, and by sheer virtue of its modesty proceeds to pull off the kind of miraculous, emotionally resonant storytelling that reduces Hollywood garbage like 'Stepmom' to shame.Terry (Mark Ruffalo) and Sammy Prescott (Laura Linney) are a brother and sister who have shared a unique bond ever since their parents died in a car crash years ago. Sammy is now a single mother who works at a bank in a small New York town, while her brother has become something of a ne'er-do-well'a leech and a freewheeler who's constantly hitting his sister up for money. After a long absence, Terry comes home to visit'and that sets the film in motion.There are no jarring plot twists, no unrealistic turns of character, no ridiculous leaps of logic to bring this scenario to a tidy resolution. 'You Can Count On Me' is too intelligent to treat these characters as anything less than human beings, and too honest to resort to the coy emotional pandering that passes for today's 'family' dramas. What the film does, with a display of patience and restraint that is almost stunning in its rarity, is sit back and observe these people interact. Blessed by Lonergan's uncanny ear for realistic, articulate dialogue (no cliched soundbytes or glib one-liners here), 'You Can Count On Me' plumbs such intimate depths of truth, humor and drama you feel positively grateful for being allowed to share in these people's lives.That's due in no small part to the two central actors, who create a sibling relationship that's so painfully funny and real it has to be seen to be believed. Linney has had diabolical supporting roles in other films ('The Truman Show' and 'The House of Mirth'), but it took a small little movie like this to reveal the full expanse of her powers. Her acting is seamless, touching upon so many different nuances, and with such little effort, that it's easy to underestimate the consummate skill behind it. Make no mistake; this is one actress we will be seeing plenty more of, and I wouldn't be surprised if Ms. Linney won a rackful of Oscars in the future to compensate for the one Julia Roberts stole from her. No less impressive are Ruffalo, whose performance drew comparisons to Brando--Brando, for heaven's sake--and Rory Culkin, as Sammy's son.Watching Lonergan's film, I was reminded of Mike Leigh's masterpiece 'Secrets and Lies,' which similarly dealt with an entire spectrum of human emotions using the gentlest of approaches. Lonergan is a very different filmmaker, but just as sure-footed. One of his many masterstrokes is to withhold until the end the true meaning of the title, which at first glance might seem unnecessarily drippy. It isn't. Only in a final scene as poignant as it is understated do we fully understand the title's significance, and the full meaning of what Lonergan has imparted to us through this beautiful, bountiful film.",5,This is what a REAL family drama looks like,997142400,"08 7, 2001",2001,3304,"['When', 'movie', 'most', 'ordinary', 'potentially', 'mundane', 'situations', 'experience', 'nothing', 'less', 'wholly', 'enthralling', 'know', ""'re"", 'presence', 'one', 'year', 'very', 'best', 'films', 'Kenneth', 'Lonergan', ""'You"", 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'Spike', 'Jonze', ""'Being"", 'John', 'Malkovich', 'may', 'be', 'most', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'debut', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'kind', 'movie', 'most', 'limited', 'resources', 'imaginable', 'sheer', 'virtue', 'modesty', 'proceeds', 'pull', 'off', 'kind', 'miraculous', 'emotionally', 'resonant', 'storytelling', 'Hollywood', 'garbage', ""'Stepmom"", 'shame.Terry', 'Mark', 'Ruffalo', 'Sammy', 'Prescott', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'are', 'brother', 'sister', 'who', 'have', 'shared', 'unique', 'bond', 'ever', 'parents', 'died', 'car', 'crash', 'years', 'ago', 'Sammy', 'now', 'single', 'mother', 'who', 'bank', 'small', 'New', 'York', 'town', 'brother', 'become', 'something', ""ne'er-do-well"", 'leech', 'freewheeler', 'who', 'constantly', 'hitting', 'sister', 'up', 'money', 'long', 'absence', 'Terry', 'home', ""visit'and"", 'film', 'motion.There', 'are', 'jarring', 'plot', 'twists', 'unrealistic', 'turns', 'character', 'ridiculous', 'leaps', 'logic', 'bring', 'scenario', 'tidy', 'resolution', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'too', 'intelligent', 'treat', 'characters', 'anything', 'less', 'human', 'beings', 'too', 'honest', 'resort', 'coy', 'emotional', 'pandering', 'today', ""'family"", 'dramas', 'What', 'film', 'display', 'patience', 'restraint', 'almost', 'stunning', 'rarity', 'sit', 'back', 'observe', 'people', 'interact', 'Blessed', 'Lonergan', 'uncanny', 'ear', 'realistic', 'articulate', 'dialogue', 'cliched', 'soundbytes', 'glib', 'one-liners', 'here', 'Can', 'Count', 'Me', 'plumbs', 'such', 'intimate', 'depths', 'truth', 'humor', 'drama', 'feel', 'positively', 'grateful', 'being', 'allowed', 'share', 'people', 'lives.That', 'due', 'small', 'part', 'two', 'central', 'actors', 'who', 'create', 'sibling', 'relationship', 'so', 'painfully', 'funny', 'real', 'be', 'seen', 'be', 'believed', 'Linney', 'had', 'diabolical', 'supporting', 'roles', 'other', 'films', 'Truman', 'Show', ""'The"", 'House', 'Mirth', 'took', 'small', 'little', 'movie', 'reveal', 'full', 'expanse', 'powers', 'acting', 'seamless', 'touching', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'nuances', 'such', 'little', 'effort', 'easy', 'underestimate', 'consummate', 'skill', 'Make', 'mistake', 'one', 'actress', 'will', 'be', 'seeing', 'plenty', 'more', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'Ms.', 'Linney', 'won', 'rackful', 'Oscars', 'future', 'compensate', 'one', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'stole', 'less', 'impressive', 'are', 'Ruffalo', 'performance', 'drew', 'comparisons', 'Brando', 'Brando', 'heaven', 'sake', 'Rory', 'Culkin', 'Sammy', 'son.Watching', 'Lonergan', 'film', 'was', 'reminded', 'Mike', 'Leigh', 'masterpiece', ""'Secrets"", 'Lies', 'similarly', 'dealt', 'entire', 'spectrum', 'human', 'emotions', 'using', 'gentlest', 'approaches', 'Lonergan', 'very', 'different', 'filmmaker', 'just', 'sure-footed', 'One', 'many', 'masterstrokes', 'withhold', 'end', 'true', 'meaning', 'title', 'first', 'glance', 'might', 'seem', 'unnecessarily', 'drippy', ""n't"", 'Only', 'final', 'scene', 'as', 'poignant', 'understated', 'do', 'fully', 'understand', 'title', 'significance', 'full', 'meaning', 'what', 'Lonergan', 'imparted', 'beautiful', 'bountiful', 'film']",N/A

For those of you turned off by this type of ""bigness"", ""You Can Count on Me"" is your safe haven. The film revolves around Sammy Prescott (wonderfully played by Laura Linney), a divorced mom with a young son named Rudy (Rory Culkin). Sammy is a loan officer at a bank who has an established routine in her life. She dates the same man, picks up her son after school at the same time every day, and lives life as best as she can. Then her routine is disrupted by two events. The first event is a visit by her brother Terry (Mark Ruffalo) who has a habit of being predictably unpredictable. Terry is the opposite of Sammy, he isn't grounded and lives for the moment, blissfully unaware of any consequences his actions may have. Despite his shortcomings, Sammy loves Terry dearly but a tension develops between the siblings because Sammy is not sure if Terry is a good influence for her son. The second event is the appearance of a new boss at work named Brian (Matthew Broderick). Brian proves to be the devoted company man who has no tolerance any deviations from the norm. Whether it's the color of the graphics on your personal computer screen or your habit of leaving work early - he's not having any of it. Yet, Sammy finds herself strangely attracted to this married man anyway even though she knows nothing good will come of a realtionship with him. Now this summary of the film won't pique the interest of any filmgoer conditioned to attend only Hollywood spectacles, but that's what gives the film its appeal. It is enjoyable precisely because it is not an empty overbloated Hollywood product. It is a small film that focuses on a small town where prospective mates for marriage are few and everyone knows what your kid was doing the night before. It is a film that follows small people who don't alter the course of human events by their decisions but make mistakes like you and me and learn from them. Writer-director Kenneth Lonergan weaves together an enchanting personal film filled with richly detailed characters.

You bet.  &quot;You Can Count On Me&quot; is a modestly produced but potent drama about two adult siblings just trying to get on in the world.  Sammy (played with understated grace by Laura Linney) is a single mom struggling to balance her thankless job at the bank, raising her 8-year old kid (Rory Culkin, Macaulay's brother), and trying to shake off an unfulfilling relationship.  She has an unreasonably rigid boss (played by Matthew Broderick) who nitpicks at her every move in the office.  Out of the blue, her wayward brother (the badly underrated Mark Ruffalo) comes to town with little more than the clothes on his back and chump change.  He moves in with her, befriends her son (the way this friendship blooms in the movie is a delight to see), and causes all sorts of drama.  Without revealing spoilers, &quot;You Can Count On Me&quot; is a perfect example of minimalism at its best.

This film apparently started out as a short film about two people eating lunch in a restaurant and has been expanded into feature length.  Fairly interesting characters in search of a plot.  If your idea of drama is watching a woman try to convince her brother to go to church then you will probably enjoy this movie, but that's about as dramatic as this movie gets.  I got the impression that the writer/director has not lived a particularly interesting life.

132994,A3N110LGDXE6FH,0792175220,Veronica,"[4, 5]","Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo are two of my favourite actors, so seeing them together in the same film playing sister and brother is a rare treat. They are both spot on in their portrayals of, respectively, a single mother yearning for some excitement, and an unreliable drifter whose life so far has been a series of mistakes.I've always thought that the 'family drama' type of film is very difficult for directors to get right. It is very easy for it to be too sickly-sweet or for the family being portrayed to be ridiculously dysfunctional. Luckily, You Can Count On Me has the perfect blend of comedy and seriousness, and the characters actions make sense in the context of their pasts and personalities. The film is also fast-paced and shot in a unique and stylish way.The film plays like a series of everyday moments strung together. The main characters make poor choices and do morally reprehensible things, but you somehow find yourself rooting for them and hoping things work out OK. Terry (Mark Ruffalo) was a particularly interesting character, because he seemed incapable of being dependable or responsible. For example, he turns up late for a very important meeting although he has promised to be on time. It is as if he wants to sabotage his own chances of happiness - I found this to be very moving and true to real life. Rory Culkin, who plays the young son in the film, is also an exceptional actor and he manages to make a difficult role very believable.I also felt the portrayal of Ron the priest was excellent. He was a sympathetic and non-judgemental character and he really added a lot to the film. I also thought the line that Terry says hits the nail on the head about why it is so hard to have faith sometimes: 'But I don't want to believe in something or not believe in it because I might feel bad. I want to believe in it or not believe in it because I think it's true or not'.Overall, this is real gem of a film and I hope it gets a wide audience because it really deserves it. It is realistic and thought-provoking in many ways. Kenneth Lonergan deserves a lot of credit for writing such a strong screenplay and managing to direct an excellent film from it. Highly recommended.**Spoiler Alert**P.S. I loved the way the film title was used in the ending without the words actually being said.

The last five minutes of it had moved me to massive tears almost every time I watched it. Laura Linney and Mark Rufallo are heartbreaking and wonderful together. Just for the record, I thought Linney who had collected a handful of best actress awards with this film was more deserving to win the Oscar than ""Pretty Woman"". She lost it because she was not as famous. And Mark Rufallo should've been nominated for the Oscar! Do watch this film with a box of tissues on the side.Linney and Rufallo are orphaned siblings in a small town(Scottsville), their parents died in a car accident when they were kids. Rufallo comes home to visit Linney after drifting around the world for a several years, and Linney was so excited about it. They met up for lunch and updated with each other on what's been going on. linney was so upset to learned that he was in financial trouble again and that he was in jail. She lent him some money and took him home.Rufallo became good friend with Linney's son played by Rory Culkin, and he even took him out to play pool and fishing. He got in trouble when he took Culkin to see his dad whom he had never met before, and got denied. His dad got in a nasty fight with Rufallo and the police arrested Rufallo. Linney was furious about his action and wanted him to get out.Meanwhile, Linney is having an affair with her pathetic control freak boss whose wife is pregnant already. Linney's is being also proposed by her boyfriend. So everything is driving her nuts.She eventually forgives her brother and they reconciled. And it was time for him to hit the road again, even though Linney desperately wanted hom to stay.
