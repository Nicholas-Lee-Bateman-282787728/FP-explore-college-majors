Katherine Helmond is a competent actress, but  Sid Caesar, as an actor... well he should stick to comedy.Poor overall story line and characters are SO sweet, if you're over the age of 8 they'll make your teeth ache.Includes a free music CD that I haven't even bothered to listen to.  I already have Christmas music with artists I enjoy, so this was no bonus for me.Sorry, but even with its low price, I recommend you give this a pass.",2,No Christmas Joy Here,1265068800,"02 2, 2010",2010,523,"['Even', 'like', 'corny', 'sentimental', 'Christmas', 'stories', 'do', 'one', 'too', 'much', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'competent', 'actress', 'Sid', 'Caesar', 'actor', 'well', 'should', 'stick', 'comedy.Poor', 'overall', 'story', 'line', 'characters', 'are', 'SO', 'sweet', ""'re"", 'age', '8', ""'ll"", 'make', 'teeth', 'free', 'music', 'CD', 'have', ""n't"", 'even', 'bothered', 'listen', 'already', 'have', 'Christmas', 'music', 'artists', 'enjoy', 'was', 'bonus', 'me.Sorry', 'even', 'low', 'price', 'recommend', 'give', 'pass']",Christmas Snow

879589,A358XP3X4U0X45,B0007CEXRM,bookloversfriend,"[16, 28]","This ""movie"" is only 48 minutes long.  Made in 1986, it was obviously a one-TV-hour show.  See it only if you're a fan of one of the performers.This gets my vote for the worst Christmas movie ever made and one of the worst movies ever made.  The acting by Katherine Helmond is the phoniest I remember ever seeing.  It's astounding to watch, it's so bad.  You just keep gaping: how can anybody be that bad?The little girl, Melissa Hart, is very cute.  I hope she got the parts she deserves.The story is the length of a short-short, so there's a lot of treading water in this show.  The gratuitous nastiness to the woman customer who had traveled all the way across town in the snow was stunning.  The fact that the little girl did not tell her adoptive mother about the footprints after they'd all been searching for the man all day is not credible.Bottom line: if you buy this movie, you get what you deserve.",1,Think the worst and you'll be half right,1171497600,"02 15, 2007",2007,909,"['movie', 'only', '48', 'minutes', 'long', 'Made', '1986', 'was', 'obviously', 'one-TV-hour', 'show', 'See', 'only', ""'re"", 'fan', 'one', 'performers.This', 'vote', 'worst', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'one', 'worst', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'acting', 'Katherine', 'Helmond', 'phoniest', 'remember', 'ever', 'seeing', 'astounding', 'watch', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'keep', 'gaping', 'how', 'can', 'anybody', 'be', 'bad', 'little', 'girl', 'Melissa', 'Hart', 'very', 'cute', 'hope', 'got', 'parts', 'deserves.The', 'story', 'length', 'short-short', 'lot', 'treading', 'water', 'show', 'gratuitous', 'nastiness', 'woman', 'customer', 'who', 'had', 'traveled', 'way', 'town', 'snow', 'was', 'stunning', 'fact', 'little', 'girl', 'did', 'not', 'tell', 'adoptive', 'mother', 'footprints', ""'d"", 'been', 'searching', 'man', 'day', 'not', 'credible.Bottom', 'line', 'buy', 'movie', 'get', 'what', 'deserve']",Christmas Snow
879590,A266TORT5VENQ7,B0007CEXRM,Classic Debut,"[25, 26]","I found this DVD at Kmart for $3.  It came with a dvd of Christmas music. I figured for the price I would take a chance.It was a made for TV  movie from 1986 based on the novelette ""London Snow"". It stars Katherine Helmond, veteran actor Sid Caesar, a very young Melissa Joan Hart, and Kimble Joyner. It won an Emmy in 1987 for cinematography and an ASC award in 1988. It's only 48 minutes long.It seems to be set in the 1950's. Mrs Mutterance (Helmond)is a widow who runs a candy shop in the lower level of a building where she lives on the 2nd floor with her 2 adopted children (Joyner and Hart). Her mean spirited Landlord, Mr Snyder(Caesar)tells her she has two weeks to vacate the building 2 days before Christmas.  After a blizzard, Mr. Snyder turns up missing. Mrs. Mutterance and children go looking for him. The moral of the story is helping others even when they are not nice to you.Melissa Joan Hart is very cute in this movie and I thought all of the actors were good, but I thought this presentation fell short of a holiday classic.  I think it is a better production than the made for tv movies are today. Not as silly and shallow. Well worth the $3 I paid for it.
