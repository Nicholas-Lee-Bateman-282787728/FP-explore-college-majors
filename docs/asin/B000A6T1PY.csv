I knew this movie probably would suck but you have to take the chance. I should have saved my money instead. I have no idea what this film is about & I watched it. 3 random horror clich&eacute;s are in a pick up truck-black guy, nerd, & a douche bag. They run out of gas, not to bad yet, but nothing really stands out. They encounter a girl saying her friends were murdered & the nerd gets killed as well by this unseen force, the screen goes green when he is near. Anyways, skip a year & a kid has visions of this night & dreams about killing random people. This movie sucks, plain & simple. It doesn't make much sense, the only saving grace is the villain didn't look half bad but it isn't enough to save it.

922475,A3VBVES8IYR5ZJ,B000A6T1PY,Daniel W. Kelly,"[6, 7]","this movie will keep you somewhat entertained, but it goes from one extreme to the other.  There is some excellent editing for the horror genre, but then there is general editing that is just awful. There is some gore and some well-crafted chilling visuals, but you will never jump out of your seat. Acting is mostly not very good.As for the plot, it's basically I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Jack-O (anyone remember that film?). The ""killer"" is a somewhat creepier looking version of Jack-O. The real problem lies in the lack of explanation for anything that is happening. The reasons for the killings is explained at the end--but not who Jack O Lantern is or why he manifests himself. You're sort of left to draw your own conclusions. And the way he is destroyed at the end is really anti-climactic. Also, there's an intro to the movie that is really detached from the rest of the film, and doesn't connect at all.Honestly, there's no predicting whether you will like this movie or not. At this price, I definitely suggest you rent it first to decide if it's worthy of your horror collection.",3,ok supernatural slasher...but not for the price...,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,1102,"['movie', 'will', 'keep', 'somewhat', 'entertained', 'one', 'extreme', 'other', 'excellent', 'editing', 'horror', 'genre', 'then', 'general', 'editing', 'just', 'awful', 'gore', 'well-crafted', 'chilling', 'visuals', 'will', 'never', 'jump', 'seat', 'Acting', 'mostly', 'not', 'very', 'good.As', 'plot', 'basically', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'meets', 'Jack-O', 'anyone', 'remember', 'film', 'killer', 'somewhat', 'creepier', 'looking', 'version', 'Jack-O', 'real', 'problem', 'lack', 'explanation', 'anything', 'happening', 'reasons', 'killings', 'explained', 'end', 'not', 'who', 'Jack', 'O', 'Lantern', 'why', ""'re"", 'sort', 'left', 'draw', 'own', 'conclusions', 'way', 'destroyed', 'end', 'really', 'anti-climactic', 'Also', 'intro', 'movie', 'really', 'detached', 'rest', 'film', ""n't"", 'connect', 'all.Honestly', 'predicting', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'not', 'price', 'definitely', 'suggest', 'rent', 'first', 'decide', 'worthy', 'horror', 'collection']",Jack 0' Lantern
922476,A34IBXM7E8CPWE,B000A6T1PY,David Girod,"[3, 4]","Just a quick side-note. I love bad horror films. I love cheesy-bad horror films. And one of the best parts about seeing a bad film is coming here to Amazon to read the reviews. I got a good laugh out of a couple of the reviews posted here....the fact that you can add the ""Jack O'Lantern"" DVD to your wedding registry is GREAT! I never would have noticed that if it weren't pointed out in a review! I want to get divorced and remarried just so I can register a ton of crappy movies for me and my future wife!Okay onto the movie. Maybe it's just me, but I enjoyed this film. Sure it's grade Z stuff, with bad acting, goofy special effects, and has the production values of your standard home movies, but I enjoyed it. Of course I only paid $1.99 for it at Blockbuster, so I felt I got my money's worth. And while the story is hardly original, ""Wrong Turn"" meets ""Pumpkinhead"" meets ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", it was kind of fun. It's nonsense, but it's fun nonsense. Like how ""Jack"" chases several victims around the Georgian suburbs in broad daylight, but we later learn, sunlight may be Jack's Achilles heel? And ""Jack"" is a pretty impressive looking monster....until he steps out of the shadows. When we finally see ""Jack"" in full lighting you can't help but chuckle. The acting is awful for sure, but I gotta say I couldn't do any better, and it's about on par with what you would expect from an indy horror flick shot in Georgia.The ""Behind the Screams"" extra is great. Everyone is so excited and talking about ""Jack O'Lantern"" as though it's an A-List film. But it does offer a neat peak into the world of indy films. I don't think I would recommend ""Jack O'Lantern"" to anyone wanting a truly scary flick, but if you like your horror with no production values, and served with a heaping load of cheese, then you might like this movie.And by the way, for those of you who think the is the ""worst horror movie ever!"", I defy you to sit through ""The Last Slumber Party"".",2,Maybe it's Just Me???,1150416000,"06 16, 2006",2006,1980,"['Just', 'quick', 'side-note', 'love', 'bad', 'horror', 'films', 'love', 'cheesy-bad', 'horror', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'parts', 'seeing', 'bad', 'film', 'coming', 'here', 'Amazon', 'read', 'reviews', 'got', 'good', 'laugh', 'couple', 'reviews', 'posted', 'here', '.the', 'fact', 'can', 'add', 'Jack', ""O'Lantern"", 'DVD', 'wedding', 'registry', 'GREAT', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'noticed', 'were', ""n't"", 'pointed', 'out', 'review', 'want', 'get', 'divorced', 'remarried', 'just', 'so', 'can', 'register', 'ton', 'crappy', 'movies', 'future', 'wife', 'Okay', 'movie', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'Sure', 'grade', 'Z', 'stuff', 'bad', 'acting', 'goofy', 'special', 'effects', 'production', 'values', 'standard', 'home', 'movies', 'enjoyed', 'course', 'only', 'paid', '1.99', 'Blockbuster', 'felt', 'got', 'money', 'worth', 'story', 'hardly', 'original', 'Wrong', 'Turn', 'Pumpkinhead', 'Know', 'What', 'Did', 'Last', 'Summer', 'was', 'kind', 'fun', 'nonsense', 'fun', 'nonsense', 'how', 'Jack', 'several', 'victims', 'Georgian', 'suburbs', 'broad', 'daylight', 'later', 'learn', 'sunlight', 'may', 'be', 'Jack', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'Jack', 'pretty', 'impressive', 'looking', 'monster', 'shadows', 'When', 'finally', 'see', 'Jack', 'full', 'lighting', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'chuckle', 'acting', 'awful', 'sure', 'got', 'ta', 'say', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'better', 'par', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'indy', 'horror', 'flick', 'shot', 'Georgia.The', 'Screams', 'extra', 'great', 'Everyone', 'so', 'excited', 'talking', 'Jack', ""O'Lantern"", 'A-List', 'film', 'offer', 'neat', 'peak', 'world', 'indy', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'recommend', 'Jack', ""O'Lantern"", 'anyone', 'wanting', 'truly', 'scary', 'flick', 'like', 'horror', 'production', 'values', 'served', 'heaping', 'load', 'cheese', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'movie.And', 'way', 'who', 'think', 'worst', 'horror', 'movie', 'ever', 'defy', 'sit', 'Last', 'Slumber', 'Party']",Jack 0' Lantern

A few minutes into the movie I realized I was wrong.""What went wrong?"", you ask.  Well, to start with the prologue deals with some guys being pursued by cannibalistic rednecks.  This has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, or if it does it was during one of the moments towards the end where I began to doze off.  Sad thing is I was wide awake before I started watching.The main plot deals with your basic 26 year old ""teenager"", named Jack, who has been left seemingly brain damaged after a car accident that also took the life of his father.  The guilty parties start getting killed off by a monster with a pumpkin head(though not ""Pumpkinhead"", that movie was pretty good).  After each killing, Jack seems to become more normal.Although the plotline's derivative, this still could have been a decent movie.  Any chances of that happening are foiled by the hack writing, bad acting, and amateurish direction.  Not to mention the leaden pacing.  The movie's boring, bottom line.The DVD contains a ""making of"" featurette that's much better than the film itself.  The filmmakers and actors are enthusiastic about the film in the featurette which leads me to believe none of them had seen the finished product before they were interviewed.Ladies and gentlemen, this is one to avoid.",1,Crap o Lantern,1147651200,"05 15, 2006",2006,1410,"['had', 'marginal', 'hopes', 'one', 'looked', 'would', 'have', 'classic', 'horror', 'elements', 'slightly', 'new', 'spin', 'few', 'minutes', 'movie', 'realized', 'was', 'wrong', 'What', 'went', 'wrong', 'ask', 'Well', 'start', 'prologue', 'deals', 'guys', 'being', 'pursued', 'cannibalistic', 'rednecks', 'nothing', 'do', 'rest', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'moments', 'end', 'where', 'began', 'doze', 'off', 'Sad', 'thing', 'was', 'wide', 'awake', 'started', 'watching.The', 'main', 'plot', 'deals', 'basic', '26', 'year', 'old', 'teenager', 'named', 'Jack', 'who', 'been', 'left', 'seemingly', 'brain', 'damaged', 'car', 'accident', 'also', 'took', 'life', 'father', 'guilty', 'parties', 'start', 'getting', 'killed', 'off', 'monster', 'pumpkin', 'head', 'not', 'Pumpkinhead', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'killing', 'Jack', 'become', 'more', 'plotline', 'derivative', 'still', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'movie', 'chances', 'happening', 'are', 'foiled', 'hack', 'writing', 'bad', 'acting', 'amateurish', 'direction', 'Not', 'mention', 'leaden', 'pacing', 'movie', 'boring', 'bottom', 'line.The', 'DVD', 'making', 'featurette', 'much', 'better', 'film', 'filmmakers', 'actors', 'are', 'enthusiastic', 'film', 'featurette', 'believe', 'none', 'had', 'seen', 'finished', 'product', 'were', 'interviewed.Ladies', 'gentlemen', 'one', 'avoid']",Jack 0' Lantern

The film opens with three good old boys in a pickup truck on Halloween evening in Mississippi.  They encounter a couple of rednecks who are obviously cannibals, and also a screaming blonde who says these guys killed a bunch of her friends, and of course, the three good old boys get it too, but so do the killers by some unseen force.Flash forward to a year and lo and behold, this whole setup has nothing to do with the rest of this lamely made fiasco.  A teenage boy who looks all of 27 is mute as a result of an auto accident which killed his father.  Soon some jackolanterned killer starts wiping out his friends, and is it this lamebrained kid named Jack or what?  Forcing a totally unconvincing reason for these revenge killings does little to validate the plot.

I got this at Hollywood Video, it was in the ""3 for $30"" section, now I know why.",2,The trailer makes it look good...,1129852800,"10 21, 2005",2005,490,"['Ugh', 'movie', 'bad', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'see', 'trailer', 'AWESOME', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'First', 'was', 'done', 'hand-held', 'cameras', 'not', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'sound', 'effects', 'are', 'terrible', 'acting', 'stinks', 'usual', 'movie', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'car', 'accident', 'back', 'guy', 'who', 'Jack', 'cute', 'slow', 'got', 'Hollywood', 'Video', 'was', '3', '30', 'section', 'now', 'know', 'why']",Jack 0' Lantern
