422698,AO3J40SKIP7CN,630445287X,Alice Bright,"[39, 41]","Audie Murphy gives one of his best performances as John Gant, the hired assassin, whose arrival in town pricks a lot of guilty consciences. No one is absolutely certain who he came to kill, but that doesn't stop a few restless townspeople from getting nervous and cracking under the pressure as Gant plays it cool and bides his time. He seems unsurprised by the effect his presence has in town. As Gant eloquently puts it, he doesn't have to deliver a bullet to those types of men because ""they are already dead,"" suffocated by the weight of guilt caused by past sins. Gants kills only who he is paid to kill, and only time will tell who he has really come for.But there's more to this cold-blooded avenger than meets the eye. Or so thinks Luke, the town's likeable physician, who is a paragon of civic and moral virtue. Juxtapposed against each other, the two seem to be exact opposites, but a sort of friendship develops as Luke tries desperately to get into Gant's head and somehow turn him around before he does what he came to do. No Name on the Bullet explores many interesting issues such as vengeance, justice, law and the burden of sin. Audie Murphy reveals his darker side as he plays the self-named ""avenging angel."" He even tries to compares himself to his new friend Luke because in his mind, he too is concerned with eliminating ""public health problems,"" namely those who are guilty but unpunished.Just like Murphy himself, there's more to this film than meets the eye. And the plot takes a surprising turn at the end, too, so it's altogether unpredictable. As evidenced by another great performance in To Hell and Back, Audie Murphy was certainly a great soldier on screen and off. Although he was the most decorated soldier of World War II, like many other greats of his day (John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart) Murphy probably felt he was just doing his duty. There are those who think this may be just another Audie Murphy western, but this is not true at all. It's a stellar film that stands alone in its brilliant performances and handling of the fallen human condition.",5,"An Unusual Western, Audie Murphy's Best",1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,2081,"['Audie', 'Murphy', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'John', 'Gant', 'hired', 'assassin', 'arrival', 'town', 'pricks', 'lot', 'guilty', 'consciences', 'one', 'absolutely', 'certain', 'who', 'came', 'kill', ""n't"", 'stop', 'few', 'restless', 'townspeople', 'getting', 'nervous', 'cracking', 'pressure', 'Gant', 'cool', 'bides', 'time', 'unsurprised', 'effect', 'presence', 'town', 'Gant', 'eloquently', ""n't"", 'have', 'deliver', 'bullet', 'types', 'men', 'are', 'already', 'dead', 'suffocated', 'weight', 'guilt', 'caused', 'past', 'sins', 'Gants', 'only', 'who', 'paid', 'kill', 'only', 'time', 'will', 'tell', 'who', 'really', 'come', 'for.But', 'more', 'cold-blooded', 'avenger', 'eye', 'so', 'thinks', 'Luke', 'town', 'likeable', 'physician', 'who', 'paragon', 'civic', 'moral', 'virtue', 'Juxtapposed', 'other', 'two', 'seem', 'be', 'exact', 'opposites', 'sort', 'friendship', 'Luke', 'desperately', 'get', 'Gant', 'head', 'somehow', 'turn', 'around', 'what', 'came', 'do', 'No', 'Name', 'Bullet', 'many', 'interesting', 'issues', 'such', 'vengeance', 'justice', 'law', 'burden', 'sin', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'darker', 'side', 'self-named', 'avenging', 'angel', 'even', 'compares', 'new', 'friend', 'Luke', 'mind', 'too', 'concerned', 'eliminating', 'public', 'health', 'problems', 'namely', 'who', 'are', 'guilty', 'unpunished.Just', 'Murphy', 'more', 'film', 'eye', 'plot', 'surprising', 'turn', 'end', 'too', 'altogether', 'unpredictable', 'evidenced', 'great', 'performance', 'Hell', 'Back', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'was', 'certainly', 'great', 'soldier', 'screen', 'off', 'was', 'most', 'decorated', 'soldier', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'many', 'other', 'greats', 'day', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Jimmy', 'Stewart', 'Murphy', 'probably', 'felt', 'was', 'just', 'doing', 'duty', 'are', 'who', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'just', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'western', 'not', 'true', 'stellar', 'film', 'alone', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'handling', 'fallen', 'human', 'condition']",No Name on the Bullet VHS

He's right here in town,"" says the out-of breath barkeep who just ran over from the town hotel to the sheriff's office.""Who's he talkin' about? Who's Gant?"" asks Harold Miller, the deputy sheriff.""You mean you really don't know?"" says the barkeep.""I asked, didn't I?""""He's a killer,"" says Sheriff Buck Hastings.""So what? We've had some pretty good ones. We've been able to handle `em.""""Oh, no,"" says the sheriff. ""A gunman is one thing. Gant's another.""John Gant (Audie Murphy) is a paid assassin, cool, quick, deadly and smart. He's given the name of his target and collects his fee, then sets out for a bit of lawful murdering. He arrives in a town, takes a room for a few days, scouts out his victim's weaknesses, and then goads the man into drawing on him. Gant has gunned down quite a few with this technique and has never been arrested. His services come high.Now John Gant has ridden into the dusty town of Lordsburg, taken a room at the local hotel, and is biding his time. Every one in town knows Gant is going to kill someone, but no one knows who.It's not long before venality, cowardice, suspicion and fear consume some of Lordsburg's leading citizens. Quite a few show that they wear a coating of moral slime. Their fear is justified by everything from double dealing, mine stealing and wife theft. John Gant is a paid assassin, but he also seems to be the dark side of humanity's conscience. Just his presence causes suicide, vigilantism and murderous gunfights between factions in the town. Gant just looks on. The one man in town who speaks for decency is the town doc, Luke Canfield (Charles Drake). Canfield is a dedicated young medical man, serious about healing, engaged to the daughter of a retired, consumptive, dying judge. Gant and Canfield find each other interesting. Canfield is intrigued by Gant's intelligence. He finds it difficult to believe Gant is nothing but a paid killer. Gant seems drawn to Canfield's honesty. They talk a little. They enjoy a game of chess. Canfield sees himself as a healer of men. Gant sees himself as a healer of problems. It can't last. We might think it's easy to figure out Gant's intended victim; we just have to remember all the clich&eacute;s of B movies. We'd be wrong.No Name on the Bullet is an efficient B western, stuffed full with the familiar faces of B movie character actors. The acting is standard B movie quality, not bad but predictable. What makes the movie stand out as something other than just a time killer is that the plot is more intriguing than you'd expect. Essentially, one passive gunman raises havoc among the leading citizens as they unmask their own flawed motives and actions. This is accomplished within an efficient use of just 77 minutes. The movie doesn't dawdle.And then there is Audie Murphy, playing a man who finds it easy to justify, for pay, bringing death a little earlier than expected to men who mostly deserve what he deals them. Murphy was no great shakes as an actor, and he learned his craft while doing it. Partly because of his extraordinary combat war record, his struggles with what now we call Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, his early hardscrabble life and being responsible for his younger brothers and sisters, and his modesty, I've always respected the man. He wasn't a big guy, he had a baby face that sometimes helped and sometimes didn't. He applied himself to the job at hand. He had sufficient screen presence to build himself into an above-the-title and popular lead actor. Most of his movies, in my opinion, are standard Hollywood fodder. In some circumstances, however, he could deliver unusually effective performances. He's at his best, in my opinion, inThe Red Badge of Courage(1951),The Quiet American(1958) andThe Unforgiven(1960). All three movies are flawed, with The Quiet American being awful (and a cynical and corrupt adaptation of Graham Greene's novel) and The Unforgiven being awfully long, but Murphy is just fine. I think No Name on the Bullet ranks among these in terms of Murphy's performance.The DVD looks just fine. There are no extras.",4,"""Does it really matter how a man dies or when, when he really knows it's going to happen?"" asks the judge.

422713,A2HVL790PBWYTU,630445287X,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Sometimes a man just can't come in and grab a cup of coffee and go unnoticed. Not when your reputation's as big as big britches. In NO NAME ON THE BULLET, soft-spoken, baby-faced Audie Murphy delivers an understated performance, except that there's a palpable aura of menace hanging about him. Next toTo Hell and Back, this is his best film.When infamous killer-for-hire John Gant (Murphy) and his towering reputation ride into the western town of Lordsburg, it ignites a wave of fear and paranoia. As Gant cooly insinuates his presence into the sleepy community, more than a few citizens pause to examine their past deeds, each fearful that Gant's bullet is meant for him. Murphy plays Gant with laconic ease, low-keyed and impassive, although there's always that worrying glitter in his eyes. John Gant bides his time and plays chess against the town sawbones and occasionally waxes philosophical, content to observe the townspeople's rising anxieties. One gets the sense that he's amused by the reaction he engenders. He's pretty forthcoming about the contempt he feels for them.NO NAME ON THE BULLET is an interesting departure from the typical oater. It opts for unrelenting psychological drama in lieu of the frequent shoot-'em-up, and it offers an atypical ending. It's a thoughtful and fascinating character study. For most of the film, Gant is a passive entity. But his presence alone serves as a catalyst to upheaval within the community. Lots of guilty consciences fester in Lordsburg, and several of these panicked parties decide to take matters into their own hands. One in particular grows so alarmed that he chooses to kill himself. Gant is notorious for his modus operandi of goading his victim into drawing first so that Gant can later claim self-defense. The town sheriff finds his hands tied as this professional assassin has as yet to break the law.The only man in town that Gant seems to respect is Luke Canfield (Charles Drake), the righteous town physician who can throw a mean hammer. Gant and Canfield like each other - and Gant refers to Canfield as ""the only other honest man in town"" - but, given their opposing vocations, it's inevitable that they butt heads. A real-life highly decorated World War II hero, Audie Murphy is always best when playing characters close to his own personality and type. Gant is a stone-cold killer and this sparks enough commonality within Murphy that he effortlessly brings him to life. To see Murphy in this role is to get cheesed that he was cast in so many second string movies, because NO NAME ON THE BULLET hints at how good he could've been, never mind that he's routinely expressed his disinterest in acting. But just watch him as he, while seated with palms on the saloon table, quietly faces down a drunk about to make a play. Or later when he, all by his lonesome, intimidates a posse of armed men. He informs them: ""I use my gun for money and I don't like to work for nothing. But you trouble me again and I might have to break my rule."" The mob sheepishly disperses. Audie Murphy has always had that quiet authority. He convinces me that he really can back down desperate people by dint of mere presence and a few words. Abetted by a menacing reputation, of course.Note that the DVD presents the film in Anomorphic Widescreen (aspect ratio 2.35:1) and includes the original theatrical trailer.",5,"""Well, in this case, the reputation is the man.""",1322956800,"12 4, 2011",2011,3364,"['Sometimes', 'man', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'come', 'grab', 'cup', 'coffee', 'go', 'unnoticed', 'Not', 'when', 'reputation', 'as', 'big', 'big', 'britches', 'NO', 'NAME', 'ON', 'THE', 'BULLET', 'soft-spoken', 'baby-faced', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'understated', 'performance', 'palpable', 'aura', 'menace', 'hanging', 'Next', 'toTo', 'Hell', 'Back', 'best', 'film.When', 'infamous', 'killer-for-hire', 'John', 'Gant', 'Murphy', 'towering', 'reputation', 'ride', 'western', 'town', 'Lordsburg', 'wave', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'Gant', 'cooly', 'presence', 'sleepy', 'community', 'more', 'few', 'citizens', 'pause', 'examine', 'past', 'deeds', 'fearful', 'Gant', 'bullet', 'meant', 'Murphy', 'Gant', 'laconic', 'ease', 'low-keyed', 'impassive', 'always', 'worrying', 'glitter', 'eyes', 'John', 'Gant', 'time', 'plays', 'chess', 'town', 'sawbones', 'occasionally', 'waxes', 'philosophical', 'content', 'observe', 'townspeople', 'rising', 'anxieties', 'One', 'sense', 'amused', 'reaction', 'pretty', 'forthcoming', 'contempt', 'them.NO', 'NAME', 'ON', 'THE', 'BULLET', 'interesting', 'departure', 'typical', 'oater', 'unrelenting', 'psychological', 'drama', 'lieu', 'frequent', ""shoot-'em-up"", 'atypical', 'ending', 'thoughtful', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'most', 'film', 'Gant', 'passive', 'entity', 'presence', 'alone', 'catalyst', 'upheaval', 'community', 'Lots', 'guilty', 'consciences', 'fester', 'Lordsburg', 'several', 'panicked', 'parties', 'decide', 'take', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'One', 'particular', 'grows', 'so', 'alarmed', 'kill', 'Gant', 'notorious', 'modus', 'operandi', 'goading', 'victim', 'drawing', 'first', 'so', 'Gant', 'can', 'later', 'claim', 'self-defense', 'town', 'sheriff', 'hands', 'tied', 'professional', 'assassin', 'as', 'yet', 'break', 'law.The', 'only', 'man', 'town', 'Gant', 'respect', 'Luke', 'Canfield', 'Charles', 'Drake', 'righteous', 'town', 'physician', 'who', 'can', 'throw', 'mean', 'hammer', 'Gant', 'Canfield', 'other', 'Gant', 'refers', 'Canfield', 'only', 'other', 'honest', 'man', 'town', 'given', 'opposing', 'vocations', 'inevitable', 'butt', 'heads', 'real-life', 'highly', 'decorated', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'hero', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'always', 'best', 'when', 'playing', 'characters', 'close', 'own', 'personality', 'type', 'Gant', 'stone-cold', 'killer', 'enough', 'commonality', 'Murphy', 'effortlessly', 'life', 'see', 'Murphy', 'role', 'get', 'cheesed', 'was', 'cast', 'so', 'many', 'second', 'string', 'movies', 'NO', 'NAME', 'ON', 'THE', 'BULLET', 'hints', 'how', 'good', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'never', 'mind', 'routinely', 'expressed', 'disinterest', 'acting', 'just', 'watch', 'seated', 'palms', 'saloon', 'table', 'quietly', 'down', 'drunk', 'make', 'play', 'later', 'when', 'lonesome', 'posse', 'armed', 'men', 'use', 'gun', 'money', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'work', 'nothing', 'trouble', 'again', 'might', 'have', 'break', 'rule', 'mob', 'sheepishly', 'disperses', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'always', 'had', 'quiet', 'authority', 'really', 'can', 'back', 'down', 'desperate', 'people', 'dint', 'mere', 'presence', 'few', 'words', 'Abetted', 'menacing', 'reputation', 'course.Note', 'DVD', 'film', 'Anomorphic', 'Widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', '2.35:1', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer']",No Name on the Bullet VHS

He is known to have killed over twenty men. His practice is to arrive, secure a hotel room, and view the town before he kills his victim. He was never arrested because he always goads his victims into drawing a gun first and then killing them in self defense. Many city inhabitants see the gunman take the hotel room and become agitated - and here is the psychology - because they had done wrong in the past or they have rivals at present, and they think that the gunman has come to kill them. Their reactions are interesting to view. Also interesting is the town doctor who tries to stop the people from killing one another because they fear that a rival hired the gunman, and trying to stop others from trying to kill the gunman before he kills them.

He was a cold-eyed individual, brought about largely by his 2 years in combat and subsequently suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. If he had been born during the Old West times, he would have been a killer. ""No Name on the Bullet"" personifies Murphy's personality had he lived during those times.Murphy gives a splendid performance as John Gant, a hired killer whose presence in Lordsburg causes total chaos, even though he does nothing at first - just sitting around drinking coffee and playing chess with the local physician.Murphy's facial expressions were great as he smugly looked around and watched the carnage his name and reputation created. The banker winds up killing himself (even though he wasn't Murphy's target), and another man in town tries to get drunk enough to have the courage to face Gant, who stares him down and sends him fleeing from the bar.This was probably Murphy's finest performance outside of ""To Hell and Back,"" when he was not really acting but working on raw emotion, adrenaline and painful memories of the war.Even when the town bands together and comes to make him leave, Gant remains cold as ice and backs them down. He knew they could kill him, but the question was ""How many could Gant kill before they killed him?"" None of them were willing to die to get rid of Gant.Charles Drake also delivered a great performance as the physician opposite Murphy's character. While the entire town was in panic and chaos, wondering who Gant had come for, Drake calmly plays a game of chess with the gunman, trying to get inside his head and figure out what ""makes him tick.""A suspenseful thriller with a minimum amount of violence, ""No Name on the Bullet"" comes highly recommended.",5,A splendid performance by Murphy!!!,1012176000,"01 28, 2002",2002,1827,"['Everyone', 'always', 'talks', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'baby', 'face', 'slight', 'build', 'take', 'close', 'look', 'eyes', 'was', 'cold-eyed', 'individual', 'brought', 'about', 'largely', '2', 'years', 'combat', 'subsequently', 'suffering', 'Post', 'Traumatic', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'had', 'been', 'born', 'Old', 'West', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'killer', 'Name', 'Bullet', 'Murphy', 'personality', 'had', 'lived', 'times.Murphy', 'splendid', 'performance', 'John', 'Gant', 'hired', 'killer', 'presence', 'Lordsburg', 'causes', 'total', 'chaos', 'even', 'nothing', 'first', 'just', 'sitting', 'around', 'drinking', 'coffee', 'playing', 'chess', 'local', 'physician.Murphy', 'facial', 'expressions', 'were', 'great', 'smugly', 'looked', 'watched', 'carnage', 'name', 'reputation', 'created', 'banker', 'up', 'killing', 'even', 'was', ""n't"", 'Murphy', 'target', 'man', 'town', 'tries', 'get', 'drunk', 'enough', 'have', 'courage', 'face', 'Gant', 'who', 'down', 'fleeing', 'bar.This', 'was', 'probably', 'Murphy', 'finest', 'performance', 'Hell', 'Back', 'when', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'acting', 'working', 'raw', 'emotion', 'adrenaline', 'painful', 'memories', 'war.Even', 'when', 'town', 'together', 'make', 'leave', 'Gant', 'cold', 'ice', 'down', 'knew', 'could', 'kill', 'question', 'was', 'How', 'many', 'could', 'Gant', 'kill', 'killed', 'None', 'were', 'willing', 'die', 'get', 'rid', 'Gant.Charles', 'Drake', 'also', 'delivered', 'great', 'performance', 'physician', 'opposite', 'Murphy', 'character', 'entire', 'town', 'was', 'panic', 'chaos', 'wondering', 'who', 'Gant', 'had', 'come', 'Drake', 'calmly', 'game', 'chess', 'gunman', 'trying', 'get', 'head', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'tick', 'suspenseful', 'thriller', 'minimum', 'amount', 'violence', 'No', 'Name', 'Bullet', 'highly', 'recommended']",No Name on the Bullet VHS

ArmstrongDirected by Jack ArnoldJohn Gant (Audie Murphy) rides into the town of Lordsburg and quietly checks into the hotel. He doesn't say much, nor does he need to - his mere presence does the talking. Gant is a killer, a hired assassin, a gunman with 23 dead men to his credit, but he is not a murderer or a criminal; all of his killings have been legal, a result of self-defense when the men he was after drew on him. When he comes to a town, someone dies as surely as if he were the angel of death - he even tells the town doctor in Lordsburg (Charles Drake) that he's in ""a similar line of work,"" and ends up playing chess with him.Who has he come to ""see"" in Lordsburg? No one is sure, but as Sheriff Buck Hastings tells his deputy, it will be mighty interesting watching the leading citizens over the next few days. Sure enough, the town banker locks himself in his office with a gun, his business partner starts wearing a gun for the first time in his life, the man they cheated in their dealings is also armed; and one guilty cuckold (Warren Stevens) is positive his ex-rival has paid Gant. Less than 12 hours after that, there's no law left in Lordsburg, every dirty little secret in every man's past starts bubbling to the surface, and gun play has broken out in the streets between the men who think their respective rivals have brought Gant to town.Yes! - that's legendary sci-fi director Jack Arnold at the helm in this always interesting western and the gift of a suspenseful ending.BIOS:1.

422727,A27M15DFUPV1CK,630445287X,peterfromkanata,"[71, 73]","As others reviewers have noted, 1959's &quot;No Name on the Bullet&quot; is far from being a typical Audie Murphy western. Under Jack Arnold's expert direction, the focus here is on suspense and tension, rather than action. When gunman John Gant rides into town, most of the local citizens are justifiably nervous. Gant is a hired killer, and he seldom visits a town just to see the sights. Much of the film revolves around the questions--why is he here ? Who is he after ? Which of the town's citizens will die ? Since Gant isn't the talkative type, the suspense keeps building, not to mention the nervous paranoia of the townfolk.As Gant, Murphy delivers a chilling performance. You never doubt that, behind that baby face and modest build, is a man not to be crossed ( by all accounts, in real life, as well as in movies ). He is not intimidated by anyone, not even a hostile crowd who thinks that, by sheer numbers, it can scare him away. As the town's doctor who tries to befriend Gant, Charles Drake delivers a strong performance as he comes to realize that he cannot distract the killer from his purpose.Other fine supporting actors further add to the quality of the film--Whit Bissell, Karl Swenson, Warren Stevens and Virginia Grey. Apart from one climactic scene with Mr. Murphy, leading lady, Joan Evans ( not to be confused with the popular comedienne ), has little to do but make coffee for her &quot;man&quot;, Charles Drake.I found the ending to be memorable, and--for those of you who like action--there is gunplay at certain crucial parts of the movie.The DVD has beautiful colour, is widescreen and mono sound. The only extra is the original trailer.Audie Murphy made a lot of westerns in the 1950s and 60s. &quot;No Name on the Bullet&quot; is not the most action-packed, but it is certainly one of the most interesting, and features one of his best perfomances.

422733,A1ZKVLM2E00KNU,630445287X,Ryan Agadoni,"[1, 1]","This is a pretty good little Western that I'd love to see remade. The title and premise are fantastic. Very simple, but ripe with promise. A known assassin-for-hire, John Gant (played by real life war hero Audie Murphy), arrives in town and checks into the hotel. Everyone has heard of him, but no one knows who he's there to kill. His method is also known: he provokes his target into a fight and then kills him in ""self-defense,"" so he gets away with it legally. Gant plays it cool for several days, allowing the more tightly-wound members of the town to self-destruct under their own hidden guilt. He befriends the town doctor named Luke (Gant reflects on the Biblical reference to the apostle/physician) before Luke learns who he is.The build-up is handled pretty well. The seedier residents immediately begin to panic and conspire against each other and Gant. None of them are particularly memorable characters, but they ratchet up the tension and provide a few great scenes when they each face Gant. The most memorable is when a tall, skinny, wife-stealing gambler gets drunk and confronts the seated assassin. Gant calmly prods him, even placing his palms flat on the table. ""All right. If you think you can do it, go ahead and try. My hands are on the table. I couldn't possibly outdraw you. So go ahead and shoot.""Another stand-out scene features Gant facing down a large posse determined to kill him or drive him out of town. ""There are many of you. Yes, you could kill me. If you're willing enough. But it's only fair to tell you that I'll kill you, Stricker. And you, Dutch Henry. The physician. His father. And there might even be time for you, storekeeper."" The scene has been played out many times since then, most memorably for me inTombstone, and while I don't know if No Name on the Bullet was the first to use this scene, it's certainly one of the most potent uses. (Warlockhad a similar scene, and is also from 1959, by chance.)Save for Murphy (and maybe Edgar Stehli as Judge Benson), the performances are mostly adequate. They do the job, they're certainly not bad, but they're nothing special, either. I'd like to see some stronger character actors filling the supporting roles in a remake, and a more interesting actor playing Luke. (The most interesting parts with Luke are always Gant's reaction to him rather than Luke himself.) Murphy as Gant captivated me, however. I don't think all of that was because of his talent, however. While he certainly plays his role well, with a Death-like calm and serenity, I had recently devoured his Wikipedia entry and was in awe knowing that this baby-faced actor was one of the most decorated soldiers in history. It was hard to divorce the man from the part while watching him.The dichotomy between the killer and the healer is perhaps a little too obvious, but it works here. Some of the dialogue from Luke is a bit on-the-nose, and I longed for a more interestingly written character, but Gant's dialogue is pretty good. He has some really good lines and only a few clunkers. (Anytime he makes medical jokes to Luke, like ""that's your prescription doc... fill it,"" I groaned.)With a length of just 77 minutes, this is a decent Western with a few exceptional elements that are worth your time.",4,A pretty good and little-seen Western,1255478400,"10 14, 2009",2009,3260,"['pretty', 'good', 'little', 'Western', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'remade', 'title', 'premise', 'are', 'fantastic', 'Very', 'simple', 'promise', 'known', 'assassin-for-hire', 'John', 'Gant', 'played', 'real', 'life', 'war', 'hero', 'Audie', 'Murphy', 'town', 'checks', 'hotel', 'Everyone', 'heard', 'one', 'who', 'there', 'kill', 'method', 'also', 'known', 'target', 'fight', 'then', 'self-defense', 'away', 'legally', 'Gant', 'several', 'days', 'allowing', 'more', 'tightly-wound', 'members', 'town', 'self-destruct', 'own', 'hidden', 'guilt', 'town', 'doctor', 'named', 'Luke', 'Gant', 'Biblical', 'reference', 'apostle/physician', 'Luke', 'learns', 'who', 'is.The', 'build-up', 'handled', 'pretty', 'well', 'seedier', 'residents', 'immediately', 'begin', 'panic', 'conspire', 'other', 'Gant', 'None', 'are', 'particularly', 'memorable', 'characters', 'ratchet', 'up', 'tension', 'provide', 'few', 'great', 'scenes', 'when', 'face', 'Gant', 'most', 'memorable', 'when', 'tall', 'skinny', 'wife-stealing', 'gambler', 'drunk', 'seated', 'assassin', 'Gant', 'calmly', 'prods', 'even', 'placing', 'palms', 'flat', 'table', 'right', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'go', 'ahead', 'try', 'hands', 'are', 'table', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'outdraw', 'So', 'go', 'ahead', 'shoot', 'stand-out', 'scene', 'features', 'Gant', 'facing', 'down', 'large', 'posse', 'determined', 'kill', 'drive', 'town', 'are', 'many', 'Yes', 'could', 'kill', ""'re"", 'willing', 'enough', 'only', 'fair', 'tell', ""'ll"", 'kill', 'Stricker', 'Dutch', 'Henry', 'physician', 'father', 'might', 'even', 'be', 'time', 'storekeeper', 'scene', 'been', 'played', 'out', 'many', 'times', 'then', 'most', 'memorably', 'inTombstone', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'Name', 'Bullet', 'was', 'first', 'use', 'scene', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'potent', 'uses', 'Warlockhad', 'similar', 'scene', 'also', '1959', 'chance', 'Save', 'Murphy', 'maybe', 'Edgar', 'Stehli', 'Judge', 'Benson', 'performances', 'are', 'mostly', 'adequate', 'do', 'job', ""'re"", 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', ""'re"", 'nothing', 'special', 'either', ""'d"", 'like', 'see', 'stronger', 'character', 'actors', 'filling', 'supporting', 'roles', 'remake', 'more', 'interesting', 'actor', 'playing', 'Luke', 'most', 'interesting', 'parts', 'Luke', 'are', 'always', 'Gant', 'reaction', 'rather', 'Luke', 'Murphy', 'Gant', 'captivated', 'however', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'talent', 'however', 'certainly', 'role', 'well', 'Death-like', 'calm', 'serenity', 'had', 'recently', 'devoured', 'Wikipedia', 'entry', 'was', 'awe', 'knowing', 'baby-faced', 'actor', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'decorated', 'soldiers', 'history', 'was', 'hard', 'divorce', 'man', 'part', 'watching', 'him.The', 'dichotomy', 'killer', 'healer', 'perhaps', 'little', 'too', 'obvious', 'here', 'dialogue', 'Luke', 'bit', 'on-the-nose', 'longed', 'more', 'interestingly', 'written', 'character', 'Gant', 'dialogue', 'pretty', 'good', 'really', 'good', 'lines', 'only', 'few', 'clunkers', 'medical', 'jokes', 'Luke', 'prescription', 'doc', 'fill', 'groaned', 'length', 'just', '77', 'minutes', 'decent', 'Western', 'few', 'exceptional', 'elements', 'are', 'time']",No Name on the Bullet VHS

Compare the understated menace in his eyes to Eastwood while you keep in mind that this man really killed somewhere around 300 men in real life, while they were shooting at him.

I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen.  I'll never forget Audie.When I was a teenager back in the 40's and 50's.  I had a huge crush on him from seeing To Hell and Back 6 or 8 times.  I'm sure I must have seen some others of his movies since my boyfriend at the time, my husband of 52 years now, loved and still loves Westerns, old and new, as we all did in those days seeing as how we had more westerns than any other genre'.  We had 5 drive-in theatres in our small town and 4 up-town theatres, and so it could be that I saw lots more of his movies. I'm getting them from Amazon and watching them now with my still ""boyfriend"". I think, however it could just be my old tired brain that doesn't let me remember.  Anyhow, watching To Hell and Back over and over, was enough at the time for me.  They don't get any better than Audie playing himself. I believe he mostly always played himself no matter what the movie.  Just cool, calm and collected.  I'm seeing them now.  He is still irresistible to me.  I don't think I saw this one.  I believe I would have remembered that very clever ending.  I thought at one point in the movie, ""that's gotta be a clue, but it wasn't the clue that I thought it would be"". (I hope I didn't give it away.)  I'm glad I never read the book, if there was one  It would have spoiled the movie for me.  Audie was just awesome in this movie.  Just as all you other reviewers said.  He was a ""cool hand AUDIE"".  (Remindful slightly of Gary Cooper, Paul Newman and Clint Eastwood, but he WAS AUDIE)I have missed him so much over the years after his unfortunate and untimely death. It's odd how that when you see someone over and over in a movie or on TV or just listening to the same music over and over the way I'm wont to do (Don Gibson) you form a kind of friendship or some kind of weird feeling that you're related.His small stature was outshone by his presence, seemingly nonchalantness, and his fearlessness.  I still say there should be an Audie Murphy Day every year on his birthday, or maybe the birthday of the day he climbed up on that burning tank and mowed down probably dozens of the enemy and saved how many of his men, or even on VE Day, since he played a huge part in that, but it's way overdue, and so I guess we'll never see one. Think about it:  We don't have any commemorative day for our country's most decorated war hero, but we have days for other peoples who never served our country.  As far as I know he never even got a stamp.  Elvis did.!! Oh I'm sorry, Elvis did serve.  Maybe if he'd given his life ""over there""??!!.  But it's all the more astounding that he didn't have to give his life. He was ""bigger"" than all of those Germans put together.  And he had a heart evidenced in his To Hell and Back book and movie. He loved his Mama and his siblings very much and took very good care of them.  When I met my love of my life, and then met his mama, and observed them together, I was talking about it with my mama one day and she said to me ""A man who loves his Mother and is good to her, is a wonderful man and will make a very good husband for some lucky girl.""  I believe it!!This was an outstanding movie, and Audie made it so for me.  If the director could take the credit for Audie's acting in this movie, then he truly deserved the credit.  But to me, it was just the way Audie has always been.  Even when he was ""Over There"" killing the bad guys.I wanted to go out to Hollywood and get him and bring him home with me, but my mama wouldn't let me.He was always MISTER COOL.However, in his biography, the author said he had his demons haunting him after his return from the war.  Well, that is totally understandable, but he surely didn't wear them on his sleeve.

422739,A1JJK67VXR1WSR,630445287X,William R. Hancock,"[14, 15]","There are people who love to do ""lists"" on AOL with regard to movies and such, and you can usually tell something about their age and their overall exposure to artistic genres by what they list in terms of their notions of ""the best"". Most such lists don't don't usually reflect much other than abysmal ignorance of the subjects they address.Any list of supposed ""best westerns"" that doesn't include Audie Murphy's awesome ""No Name On the Bullet"" is about as hare brained as one that doesn't include ""The Ox Bow Incident"" , ""The Virginian"", ""The Gunfighter"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""Red River"", ""Dodge City"", ""The Searchers"", ""Shane"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", ""Winchester 73"", or John Ford's Cavalry Trilogy on it.Fact is , the most decorated soldier...not just of World War Two...but in the entire history of the U.S. Armed Forces...could not only call artillery down on himself while he machine-gunned down an entire enemy rifle company with a .50 calbre machine gun mounted on the back of a disabled, burning tank destroyer (earning a Congressional Medal of Honor in the process)...he could also ACT. AND, if given good material and capable direction, he could do some FINE acting.""No Name On the Bullet"" is vivid, engrossing proof of that contention. This is a western that is anything BUT ""run of the mill"". Put it up against ""High Noon"" and it has twice the tension and edginess, and Audie Murphy's ""John Gant"" would have Gary Cooper's ""Marshal Will Kane"" leaving town so fast he'd leave a windstorm in his wake.Murphy's Gant is a hired killer who rides into Lordsburg one day and sets the entire town on edge. Gant's reputation is considerable. He is said to be lightning fast with a six gun and deadly accurate.He is also known to have put many men into the ground, a lot of whom were considered good gun-hands themselves.Gant's methodolgy is to goad his target into a shootout. In this manner the killing is waived as a ""self-defense"" claim...quite common and effective in the 19th century West.In Gant's case, nobody knows who he intends to kill until the event actually goes down. And here in Lordsburg everyone from bankers to miners to saloon-keepers to store-owners worries that it might be THEM...(""Everybody has enemies"")From the hour Gant hits town, stress and paranoia begin to take over. People all over town are convinced that THEY are the targets and some neighbor of theirs might be the one who hired this killer to ""do"" them. People turn against each other and the entire town becomes a powderkeg of volatility.And Gant enjoys every minute of it. He enjoys psychologically terrorizing these people. Playing them. He enjoys the effect his name has on them, how they ""kowtow"" to him and cringe when he walks by. Oh, he plays nicey-nice and ambivalent at all times. He is polite, well-spoken, obviously sophisticated, educated, and well-read (a friend commented to me once that, if t.v.'s ""Have Gun, Will Travel"" Paladin character were written to be a clean shaven, babyfaced psychopath, then this would be him).Yet there is a smug little smirk he carries around with him, and a glinting look that comes into his eyes at times that say..""watch yourself around this boyo...he's not playing with a full deck of cards"". Or does he just lack true depth of feeling or conscience?One intriguing scene has a mob of townsmen accost Gant at the porch of the city hotel. They are going to try to frighten him off...tell him to get out of town before they all cut loose on him. He looks at them withn utter contempt and urges them to have at it. He tells them which ones he's going to kill right off and then tells the rest they can take their own chances before he drops.  The mob scatters quickly. They want none of what he is selling. The scene works because of the steely-eyed believability of Murphy's performance...AND because of the psychological awareness by the audience that this IS Audie Murphy on this porch...someone who in real life could street-slap ""Scarface"".Gant is a very complex character as played by Murphy. He is both likable and scary at the same time. And Murphy the actor works the nuances that swing him back and forth BETWEEN the likable and the scary in brilliant fashion. This is GOOD actinghere. Murphy delivers a cowboy ""boogeyman"" on par with Robert Mitchum's evil preacher in ""Night of the Hunter"", and, on the strength of this performance in ""No Name"", one would have to consider that Audie Murphy could have turned in a hair-raising Norman Bates in ""Psycho"" if Anthony Perkins had not gotten the role.Everyone else in this film does a great job. Filled with familiar character-actor faces throughout, the story moves along with nary a drag and just pulls you into its multi-faceded story line and holds you there right to the end.""No Name On the Bullet"".
