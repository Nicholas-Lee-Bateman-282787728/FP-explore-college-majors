The host family, the Ledings, come across as a wonderfully wholesome family brimming with virtue and common sense. Dad is the strong sort of American male that made this country great. Mom is the caring and guiding mother figure that helped Dad. The kids are all hard working and the grandparents are loving. Which brings us to Paris and Nicole. Both of these sex/clothes/excitement obsessed ditzes come across as the worst argument for continuing our consumer culture that could be offered. Their lives are pointless; their mere existence seems like an accident that should have been avoided. I'd take the Ledings and their values and honest lives over Hilton and Ritchie any day of the week. Episodes that seemed especially staged and phony: Nicole losing it in a bar when she can't find her purse, the two girls turning a hamburger chain's sign into an obscenity.

They are overrated and a total waste of time and any body with something like a Sony camcorder could easily film their own if they wanted. Watching a reality show is like watching someone else's home movies! Not exactly fun unless it's your own.Reality shows are stupid! Just about everything the people do on the shows are stupid! They are not funny!Reality shows have some of the most stupidest people I've ever seen on T.V. and sometimes I wish somebody would just slap them around a couple times and tell them to shut the hell up!Reality shows have no point. It's always the same crap! ""Oh no, I don't wanna get voted off the island"" or ""Oh I hate that person"" or ""Boo hoo, I'm gonna start crying for no apparent reason"" or ""I want to have sex with you"" or ""Let's go be some stupid little bratty b*tches and pull some pranks on some of the workers"" (an example of THIS show on this one) SERIOUSLY! That's all they ever are! Also, it goes to show you how empty headed and foolish some people can be when you see them on a reality show.Luckily, there's shows like ""Cops"" (Not classified as in the stupid reality show category but more of a REAL LIFE show)  where stupid people can get arrested so we can laugh AT them and not WITH them! That's a show where I'd like to see Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie getting pulled over for speeding (which I'm sure they'd be dumb enough to do) and then placed in handcuffs, struggling to get away from the police officer and then placed in the back seat of the officer's car, kicking and screaming. Now THAT would be funny! I thought that other shows like ""Big Brother"" and ""Survivor"" were bad, but Fox making ones like ""Paradise Hotel"" and ""Temptation Island"" are even WORSE!Finally, reality shows are FAKE! Sometimes they're even rehearsed! I mean, come on isn't it obvious? People don't just want to go on T.V. to act retarded in front of millions of viewers! I have reason to believe that just like with Jerry Springer the people sometimes act it out. (But they're still annoying nevertheless!) It seems like the only way to save the ratings otherwise they wouldn't be so high now would they?

I couldn't agree more with the reviewer from Hanover, PA: Be ashamed that this country not only produces twits such as Paris Hilton and Nicole Ritchie but that FOX celebrates their dippiness by putting them on national television.Paris and Nicole proved that they wouldn't be able to work an honest day's work if their pampered lives depended on it.  It's truly pathetic when shallow individuals such as these two are handed a television show based on their names just to give them something to do besides &quot;modeling,&quot; shopping, partying and drinking.  Too bad people with good ideas are pushed aside to make room for this junk.The Hilton family must have been cringing as they watched this (if they even bothered to).  I've read many accounts that the Hilton family is VERY embarassed of Rick Hilton and how his branch of the family have soiled the Hilton name.  (Can you blame them?)There's no point in suggesting that these two use their wealth for humanitarian purposes.  Chances are they wouldn't know the meaning of the word (if it doesn't include the words &quot;Dior,&quot; &quot;Gucci,&quot; or &quot;Saks Fifth Avenue,&quot; these two are completely lost).Now the public will soon be &quot;blessed&quot; to have these two airheads gracing our airwaves again in &quot;The Simple Life 2.&quot;  The good Republicans at FOX (always screaming about the dumbing down of American values) will, once again, bring quality, family programming into American living rooms with a second dose of stupidity.As for the reviewer who suggested that negative reviews are from &quot;bitter&quot; people: What's to be &quot;bitter, jealous or envious about?

792567,AH65I0RNVBPWC,B00013RC34,Ksuzy,"[5, 8]","What made this series so interesting is the clash of ideals concerning &quot;upper class&quot; in America and &quot;lower and working classes&quot; in America.  While &quot;class&quot; refers to a group sharing the same economic or social status, it also refers to something of high quality or elegance (Merriam-Webster).  We tend to think of the &quot;upper class&quot; as being well-mannered and refined.  This series plays with that notion.  While Hilton and Ritchie clearly share upper class status, it was the people of the town of Altus (who did not fall into the category of the &quot;upper class&quot;) who displayed more &quot;class&quot; according to the typical definition and were made to feel uncomfortable by the lack of manners displayed by Hilton and Ritchie.In addition, the film also has interesting implications for what we view as crime.  Hilton and Ritchie put items on a charge account without the owner of the account's permission.  They later lie about several things to avoid either giving up the items or dealing with the consequences.  They make comments such as, &quot;What is the big deal?  It was only x amount of dollars&quot; and &quot;It wasn't stealing.  It was charging.&quot;  Imagine if a poor person of color did the equivalent type of crime!It's easy both to judge the women AND to be entertained by the series.

Bernabo,"[34, 49]","I am not going to argue that this is the end of the world as we know it, but just that ""The Simple Life"" represents the bottom of the barrel for me as a critic of popular culture.  Not so much the show as Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, a couple of heiresses who will never have enough money to ever be able to buy a clue as to what wretched human beings they are.  Even then, more so at the start of the show, when they were more famous for being famous than now, when they have at least accomplished sticking their arms into the wrong end of a cow.  Too bad Andy Warhol is dead because given how low the celebrity bar has gone down to admit this pair to stardom he would have to revise his postulate regarding 15 of fame.The idea here, as sold by FOX TV was ""From filthy rich to just plain filthy,"" a variation on ""Green Acres"" if you took Eva Gabor, split her in half, which would cut her age in half and divide her brain between them (at least Eva Gabor was intentionally funny).  So Paris and Nicole are sent to live on the Leding farm in Altus, Arkansas for 30 days, where three generations of Ledings have to put up with behavior that would have to be improved greatly just to be deemed adolescent.  ""The Simple Life"" is truly remarkable as the only reality show that I have ever seen in which you have a pair of participants who were complete unaffected by the entire experience.  Is the idea that there is no such thing as bad publicity a product of heredity or environment?  Is there ANYTHING in this world that would embarrass Nicole Richie?I have to pick Paris as the better of the two by default, not just because she tended to keep her mouth shut more while Nicole went on one of her fake crying jags, but because something buried deep inside her told her that it would be wrong to take back somebody's birthday gift because you bought it by charging it to somebody else's account.  I suppose television could come up with two more worthless human beings to parade before the camera and I know there is no way of stopping them in such a quest, but it is not exactly a revival of the Golden Age of television (think of something more organic as the adjective).  Paris and Nicole are like the ""National Inquirer,"" where you cannot really lampoon them because anything you come up with, no matter how obnoxious or offensive, is something they would actually do.This DVD was pretty much out in record time and includes all seven episodes of the ""series.""  Yes, they are still censored, which is a shame simply because Paris and Nicole could still be degraded by actually hearing every foul word that comes out of their mouths.  The show is so compelling in the same way as a car accident (one of those where the person who causes it walks away while everybody else is in a body bag).  Hopefully there are indeed plans for a sequel to ""The Simple Life,"" because no matter where they send these two airheads the next time the locals will be loaded for bear and although I know that Paris and Nicole will never get any joke at their expense, the viewers will and that will make all the difference the next tiime this 21st-century freak show goes on the road.Final Thought:  I assume that since these two want all the money they can get their hands on that they will never have children, because that would mean spending money (and time) on somebody else.  Is this a good thing because someday their children will see this video and Paris and Nicole might sober up long enough to realize this might not have been the smartest thing they ever did or a bad thing because it denies them the chance to find out what it is like for your children to embarrass you on national television (""The Simple Life: The Next Generation"").  Then again, all that time on the farm might have taught them something and they will not have children, they will just clone themselves.You know, it is almost too easy to make fun of these two...",4,American pop culture scrapes the bottom of the barrell,1074988800,"01 25, 2004",2004,3925,"['am', 'not', 'going', 'argue', 'end', 'world', 'know', 'just', 'Simple', 'Life', 'bottom', 'barrel', 'critic', 'popular', 'culture', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'show', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'Nicole', 'Richie', 'couple', 'heiresses', 'who', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'enough', 'money', 'ever', 'be', 'able', 'buy', 'clue', 'what', 'wretched', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'Even', 'then', 'more', 'so', 'start', 'show', 'when', 'were', 'more', 'famous', 'being', 'famous', 'now', 'when', 'have', 'least', 'accomplished', 'sticking', 'arms', 'wrong', 'end', 'cow', 'Too', 'bad', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'dead', 'given', 'how', 'low', 'celebrity', 'bar', 'gone', 'down', 'admit', 'pair', 'stardom', 'would', 'have', 'revise', 'postulate', 'regarding', '15', 'fame.The', 'idea', 'here', 'sold', 'FOX', 'TV', 'was', 'filthy', 'rich', 'just', 'plain', 'filthy', 'variation', 'Green', 'Acres', 'took', 'Eva', 'Gabor', 'split', 'half', 'would', 'cut', 'age', 'half', 'divide', 'brain', 'least', 'Eva', 'Gabor', 'was', 'intentionally', 'funny', 'Paris', 'Nicole', 'are', 'sent', 'live', 'Leding', 'farm', 'Altus', 'Arkansas', '30', 'days', 'where', 'three', 'generations', 'Ledings', 'have', 'put', 'up', 'behavior', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'improved', 'greatly', 'just', 'be', 'deemed', 'adolescent', 'Simple', 'Life', 'truly', 'remarkable', 'only', 'reality', 'show', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'have', 'pair', 'participants', 'who', 'were', 'complete', 'unaffected', 'entire', 'experience', 'idea', 'such', 'thing', 'bad', 'publicity', 'product', 'heredity', 'environment', 'there', 'ANYTHING', 'world', 'would', 'embarrass', 'Nicole', 'Richie', 'have', 'pick', 'Paris', 'better', 'two', 'default', 'not', 'just', 'tended', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'more', 'Nicole', 'went', 'one', 'fake', 'crying', 'jags', 'something', 'buried', 'deep', 'told', 'would', 'be', 'wrong', 'take', 'back', 'somebody', 'birthday', 'gift', 'bought', 'charging', 'somebody', 'else', 'account', 'suppose', 'television', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'two', 'more', 'worthless', 'human', 'beings', 'parade', 'camera', 'know', 'way', 'stopping', 'quest', 'not', 'exactly', 'revival', 'Golden', 'Age', 'television', 'think', 'something', 'more', 'organic', 'adjective', 'Paris', 'Nicole', 'are', 'National', 'Inquirer', 'where', 'can', 'not', 'really', 'lampoon', 'anything', 'come', 'up', 'matter', 'how', 'obnoxious', 'offensive', 'something', 'would', 'actually', 'do.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'out', 'record', 'time', 'seven', 'episodes', 'series', 'Yes', 'are', 'still', 'censored', 'shame', 'simply', 'Paris', 'Nicole', 'could', 'still', 'be', 'degraded', 'actually', 'hearing', 'foul', 'word', 'mouths', 'show', 'so', 'compelling', 'same', 'way', 'car', 'accident', 'one', 'where', 'person', 'who', 'away', 'everybody', 'else', 'body', 'bag', 'Hopefully', 'are', 'indeed', 'plans', 'sequel', 'Simple', 'Life', 'matter', 'where', 'send', 'two', 'airheads', 'next', 'time', 'locals', 'will', 'be', 'loaded', 'bear', 'know', 'Paris', 'Nicole', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'joke', 'expense', 'viewers', 'will', 'will', 'make', 'difference', 'next', 'tiime', '21st-century', 'freak', 'show', 'road.Final', 'Thought', 'assume', 'two', 'want', 'money', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'will', 'never', 'have', 'children', 'would', 'mean', 'spending', 'money', 'time', 'somebody', 'else', 'good', 'thing', 'children', 'will', 'see', 'video', 'Paris', 'Nicole', 'might', 'sober', 'up', 'long', 'enough', 'realize', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'smartest', 'thing', 'ever', 'did', 'bad', 'thing', 'chance', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'children', 'embarrass', 'national', 'television', 'Simple', 'Life', 'Next', 'Generation', 'Then', 'again', 'time', 'farm', 'might', 'have', 'taught', 'something', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'children', 'will', 'just', 'clone', 'themselves.You', 'know', 'almost', 'too', 'easy', 'make', 'fun', 'two']",The Simple Life: Season 1

792572,A1E15WYG9C47X1,B00013RC34,"""mobby_uk""","[7, 12]","The 'It Girls' phenomena has been all over the UK tabloids few years back, referring to young women who have had the good fortune of being born into huge wealth, and who just happen to be very beautiful, spoiled and famous for doing absolutely nothing at all !(like Tara Parker-Tomlinson,or Lady Victoria Harvey).These young women have never done any serious/or no job in their lives, and spend their days shooting covers for men's fashion magazines, shopping or skiing ,and their nights being snapped half naked and totally drunk, at the arms of some footballer or movie star.This phenomena has reached US shores, belatedly but with force with the Hilton sisters, the heiresses to the Hilton Hotel empire, the adventures or shall I shall say the misadventures of whom have occupied many a headline recently and their sexy figures have graced many covers.So Fox has come up with this smart idea of putting these girls to the ultimate test of endurance and suffering, and proving to the world at large, or whoever is interested that they are far from the dumb and spoiled rotten image that is firmly stuck to them. This momentous task would be achieved by living with a farming working class family in Arkansas for one whole month and doing some actual work..Very hard indeed!In comes Paris Hilton, along with her best friend  Nicole Richie, Lionel Richie's adopted daughter,(after Paris's sister Nikki declined to come along), ready to embark on the adventure of their lives and tackle head on the Simple Life:I can not seem to form one straight opinion about this documentary/DVD.On one hand, it is good TV: it is in a way original (besides how much can a viewer take watching endless celebs saving animals,their TV spot of choice)..It is funny at times, and after the third episode,the girls kind of grow on you. Nicole certainly fare much better than Paris as she has a kind of sweet and innocent charm, and certainly more Grey cells than her best friend.You will also definitely be shocked at the total ignorance of our lovely jet setters about normal life!Paris has never heard of Wall Mart, and thinks it is a place that sells ...'Wall Stuff'..This must sound too dumb for words, but upon reflection it is also the result of highly sheltered and pampered life!! This reminded me of Marie Antoinette saying to her starving people 'Let them eat cake'. Of course the French queen never said that and it was all a revolutionary propaganda to agitate the mobs against royalty, however Paris Hilton surely did say what she did about Wall Mart!Yet I felt that the whole series was very pretentious, and the performances far from  real. You can feel that the girls were acting/playing  for the cameras, and it was at times way over the top.In addition to that, you might find the girls sexy, funny and you might spend a good time following their mischief, but one thing you will never feel for them is sympathy! I mean it is like a big game to them, a novelty that they know will soon finish, and they will soon go back to the life they can not come out from..So I have to say that although I did enjoy watching Simple Life, my heart did not bleed for them, nor I found some of the troubles they caused their employers or the empty promises they gave to the boys of the town particularly funny.Andy Warhol famously said,'In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes'These girls have had plenty more just for playing a game that for many is an everyday struggle, one that is Simply called Life!",3,The It Girls Go  South,1076716800,"02 14, 2004",2004,3504,"[""'It"", 'Girls', 'phenomena', 'been', 'UK', 'tabloids', 'few', 'years', 'back', 'referring', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'good', 'fortune', 'being', 'born', 'huge', 'wealth', 'who', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'very', 'beautiful', 'spoiled', 'famous', 'doing', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'Tara', 'Parker-Tomlinson', 'Lady', 'Victoria', 'Harvey', '.These', 'young', 'women', 'have', 'never', 'done', 'serious/or', 'job', 'lives', 'spend', 'days', 'shooting', 'covers', 'men', 'fashion', 'magazines', 'shopping', 'skiing', 'nights', 'being', 'snapped', 'half', 'naked', 'totally', 'drunk', 'arms', 'footballer', 'movie', 'star.This', 'phenomena', 'reached', 'US', 'shores', 'belatedly', 'force', 'Hilton', 'sisters', 'heiresses', 'Hilton', 'Hotel', 'empire', 'adventures', 'shall', 'shall', 'say', 'misadventures', 'whom', 'have', 'occupied', 'many', 'headline', 'recently', 'sexy', 'figures', 'have', 'graced', 'many', 'covers.So', 'Fox', 'come', 'up', 'smart', 'idea', 'putting', 'girls', 'ultimate', 'test', 'endurance', 'suffering', 'proving', 'world', 'large', 'whoever', 'interested', 'are', 'far', 'dumb', 'spoiled', 'rotten', 'image', 'firmly', 'stuck', 'momentous', 'task', 'would', 'be', 'achieved', 'living', 'farming', 'working', 'class', 'family', 'Arkansas', 'one', 'whole', 'month', 'doing', 'actual', 'work..Very', 'hard', 'indeed', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'best', 'friend', 'Nicole', 'Richie', 'Lionel', 'Richie', 'adopted', 'daughter', 'Paris', 'sister', 'Nikki', 'declined', 'come', 'along', 'ready', 'embark', 'adventure', 'lives', 'tackle', 'head', 'Simple', 'Life', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'form', 'one', 'straight', 'opinion', 'documentary/DVD.On', 'one', 'hand', 'good', 'TV', 'way', 'original', 'how', 'much', 'can', 'viewer', 'take', 'watching', 'endless', 'celebs', 'saving', 'animals', 'TV', 'spot', 'choice', '..It', 'funny', 'times', 'third', 'episode', 'girls', 'kind', 'grow', 'certainly', 'fare', 'much', 'better', 'Paris', 'kind', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'charm', 'certainly', 'more', 'Grey', 'cells', 'best', 'friend.You', 'will', 'also', 'definitely', 'be', 'shocked', 'total', 'ignorance', 'lovely', 'jet', 'setters', 'normal', 'life', 'Paris', 'never', 'heard', 'Wall', 'Mart', 'place', ""Stuff'..This"", 'must', 'sound', 'too', 'dumb', 'words', 'reflection', 'also', 'result', 'highly', 'sheltered', 'pampered', 'life', 'reminded', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'saying', 'starving', 'people', ""'Let"", 'eat', 'cake', 'course', 'French', 'queen', 'never', 'said', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'propaganda', 'agitate', 'mobs', 'royalty', 'however', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'surely', 'did', 'say', 'what', 'did', 'about', 'Wall', 'Mart', 'felt', 'whole', 'series', 'was', 'very', 'pretentious', 'performances', 'far', 'real', 'can', 'feel', 'girls', 'were', 'acting/playing', 'cameras', 'was', 'times', 'way', 'top.In', 'addition', 'might', 'find', 'girls', 'sexy', 'funny', 'might', 'spend', 'good', 'time', 'following', 'mischief', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'never', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'mean', 'big', 'game', 'novelty', 'know', 'will', 'soon', 'finish', 'will', 'soon', 'go', 'back', 'life', 'can', 'not', 'come', 'from..So', 'have', 'say', 'did', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'Simple', 'Life', 'heart', 'did', 'not', 'bleed', 'found', 'troubles', 'caused', 'employers', 'empty', 'promises', 'gave', 'boys', 'town', 'particularly', 'funny.Andy', 'Warhol', 'famously', 'said', ""'In"", 'future', 'everyone', 'will', 'be', 'famous', 'fifteen', ""minutes'These"", 'girls', 'have', 'had', 'plenty', 'more', 'just', 'playing', 'game', 'many', 'everyday', 'struggle', 'one', 'Simply', 'called', 'Life']",The Simple Life: Season 1

Paris Hilton has certainly been in the news A LOT of late, so the show had a good chance to succeed.  I thought the first episode was very funny as the girls left their cushy life and were introduced to an Arkansas farm family.  Unfortunately, the series took a quick and cruel turn in the second episode.  The girls' first job was at a dairy and they were to fill bottles with milk.  That they made a mess of it wasn't surprising.  That they were so indifferent about the fact that someone would be drinking the ""milk"" that they had poured water into and that the spilt milk was a loss to the poor farmer who depends on milk sales for his living was quite mean spirited.  No life lessons learned here.Maybe the joke is on us.  Reality shows aren't always as unscripted as we are led to believe.

The 2003 Fox ""reality"" show followed the hotel heiress (along with her pet chiuaua Tinkerbell) and wild child daughter of singer Lionel Richie as they traded in their cushy L.A. surroundings for a month of down home farm living in the small town of Altus, Arkansas: population 807.With no cellphones or credit cards and a rickety old pickup truck as their only source of transportation, the girls move in with the Ledings, a rural deeply religious Catholic family who intend to teach the socialites the importance of hard work. Needless to say, it doesn't go over so well.Paris and Nicole work a host of jobs and manage to fail miserably at nearly all of them: bottling milk on a dairy farm, waitressing at a Sonic Drive-in (I'll leave it at ""Half Price Anal Salty Weiner Bugers""), and counting cattle at a livestock auction to name a few. They also skip out on their household chores and ignore their midnight curfew for some late night clubbin'.Dad Albert does his best to reign them in, but he's pretty much a pushover. Mom Janet is a bit more stern, but even she can't keep the girls or the family from becoming the center of town gossip. Despite all the drama, it's obvious the Ledings (especially Grandma Curly and little Braxton) care for Paris and Nicole and are sad to see them go when the month is up. Well maybe not too sad, but you know what I mean.Nicole totally makes the show. Her crazy antics and one-liners are equally hilarious and appalling. Paris is relegated to sauntering around in trashy outfits alternating between her baby coo and montone man voice dropping her trademark ""that's hot"", but she has a few comedic moments here and there. Speaking of Miss Hilton, the Penfifteen Club song of the same name gets old quick. It's nice enough, but I don't need to hear ""Ms. Hilton you must be worth a trillion bucks/ I get the feelin' that you don't really give a...."" in every episode.

I was barely able to stomach more than half of the two episodes I watched on TV, and I viewed them because they were the talk of work the mornings after they aired. But where most of my co-workers saw hilarity, I saw a pair of despicable, pathetic, spoiled bimbettes with little or no values and barely a brain to split between them. That their host family didn't take Nicole and Paris out to the woodshed for a sound whupping amazes me, because they wouldn't have lasted 30 minutes with a heartland family had the cameras not been trained on them.Yet the enormity of the hype that these two worthless show-biz kids managed to whip up around themselves gives one pause. They managed to denigrate anything that their hosts tried to offer them, couldn't as much as hold a job for more than a day without either throwing a tantrum or stealing from the employer, and basically disobeyed any kind of disciplines that were requested of them. All they seemed to be capable of doing was giggle, show cleavage, curse like sailors and behave like remorseless bubble-heads, barely capable of sheathing their contempt till they could escape the farm and get back to their bank accounts.
