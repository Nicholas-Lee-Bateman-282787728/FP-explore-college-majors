1273640,AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,B002K0WBXM,Andrew C Wheeler,"[2, 6]","When a movie doesn't quite succeed, there are many possible explanations. Perhaps the actor playing the title character was insufficient to the job, or perhaps he wasn't given enough to work with. Perhaps the bigger-name female star bent the project to make her character the center, and that threw off the balance. Perhaps the story is set in a world long gone, and none of the movie-making team could quite get into the mindset enough to make it all seem plausible.Any one of those problems -- or all of them, or others -- may have been responsible for CHERI. Or, perhaps, the movie was successful, and it was this viewer who failed to properly appreciate it. But, for one reason or another, it didn't quite work -- and it didn't work entirely because I couldn't see what Michele Pfeiffer's Lea -- or anyone, for that matter -- could possibly see in the vapid, self-obsessed, lethargic, dull and unpleasant young man called Cheri.Cheri (Rupert Friend) is attractive and young, yes -- but Lea is a high-class courtesan of long standing, and has extracted tens of thousands of francs from better men than him before breakfast. He's the son of one of her few friends, former courtesan Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates, unaccountably overemphasizing too many syllables in her speeches), and Peloux more or less asks Lea to take Cheri and educate him.She supposedly does this -- they're together for six years, from when Cheri is nineteen -- but he's just as unpleasant and tedious at the end as at the beginning. We see no sign that he's gained any maturity or poise, and he never treats Lea well. He's mildly obsessed with her, or at least with keeping her from having affairs with anyone else, but that's as far as his interest in anything outside himself goes.Pfeiffer is radiant, and allows herself to age (gracefully) as the movie goes on. But she's emoting in a void, since Friend's part is written (or acted, or edited -- it's difficult to see exactly where the fault lay) entirely in one note. CHERI does not seem to want to be the story of how one aging woman makes a horrible mistake in her love life and never realizes it, but that's the story it ends up telling. The intrusive narration, which also attempts to tell us what to feel without much effect, doesn't help the cause.Cheri does have several nice sex scenes, demurely staged, between Pfeiffer and Friend, who are both quite attractive. For some viewers, that will be enough. But those who are interested in the story, and who like to see a little reciprocity, or plausibility, in their love stories, will end up disappointed.",2,A disappointingly flat costume drama,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,2587,"['When', 'movie', ""n't"", 'quite', 'succeed', 'are', 'many', 'possible', 'explanations', 'Perhaps', 'actor', 'playing', 'title', 'character', 'was', 'insufficient', 'job', 'perhaps', 'was', ""n't"", 'given', 'enough', 'work', 'Perhaps', 'bigger-name', 'female', 'star', 'bent', 'project', 'make', 'character', 'center', 'threw', 'off', 'balance', 'Perhaps', 'story', 'set', 'world', 'long', 'gone', 'none', 'movie-making', 'team', 'could', 'quite', 'get', 'mindset', 'enough', 'make', 'seem', 'plausible.Any', 'one', 'problems', 'others', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'responsible', 'CHERI', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'was', 'successful', 'was', 'viewer', 'who', 'failed', 'properly', 'appreciate', 'one', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'entirely', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'what', 'Michele', 'Pfeiffer', 'Lea', 'anyone', 'matter', 'could', 'possibly', 'see', 'vapid', 'self-obsessed', 'lethargic', 'dull', 'unpleasant', 'young', 'man', 'called', 'Cheri.Cheri', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'attractive', 'young', 'yes', 'Lea', 'high-class', 'courtesan', 'long', 'standing', 'extracted', 'tens', 'thousands', 'francs', 'better', 'men', 'breakfast', 'son', 'one', 'few', 'friends', 'former', 'courtesan', 'Madame', 'Peloux', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'unaccountably', 'overemphasizing', 'too', 'many', 'syllables', 'speeches', 'Peloux', 'more', 'less', 'asks', 'Lea', 'take', 'Cheri', 'educate', 'him.She', 'supposedly', ""'re"", 'together', 'six', 'years', 'when', 'Cheri', 'nineteen', 'just', 'unpleasant', 'tedious', 'end', 'beginning', 'see', 'sign', 'gained', 'maturity', 'poise', 'never', 'Lea', 'well', 'mildly', 'obsessed', 'least', 'keeping', 'having', 'affairs', 'anyone', 'else', 'as', 'far', 'interest', 'anything', 'goes.Pfeiffer', 'radiant', 'age', 'gracefully', 'movie', 'emoting', 'void', 'Friend', 'part', 'written', 'acted', 'edited', 'difficult', 'see', 'exactly', 'where', 'fault', 'lay', 'entirely', 'one', 'note', 'CHERI', 'not', 'seem', 'want', 'be', 'story', 'how', 'one', 'aging', 'woman', 'horrible', 'mistake', 'love', 'life', 'never', 'story', 'up', 'telling', 'intrusive', 'narration', 'also', 'tell', 'feel', 'much', 'effect', ""n't"", 'help', 'cause.Cheri', 'have', 'several', 'nice', 'sex', 'scenes', 'demurely', 'staged', 'Pfeiffer', 'Friend', 'who', 'are', 'quite', 'attractive', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'enough', 'who', 'are', 'interested', 'story', 'who', 'like', 'see', 'little', 'reciprocity', 'plausibility', 'love', 'stories', 'will', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed']",N/A

Well, I viewed it on Netflix last night and fell in love with it.  Having only begun to read some of Colette's work, this was what got me to play it, and it was delightful.Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays an aging and still beautiful courtesan named Lea, is asked by a fellow prostitute's mother, Charlotte (played wonderfully by Cathy Bates), to teach her 19 year-old son Cheri (Rupert Friend) the ways of love in order to groom him to be suitable for marriage, and she acquiesces.  Unfortunately, the plan backfires when the unlikely couple fall in love with each other, and it causes a lifetime of heartache for the young man and the young wife he eventually takes.I felt genuinely sorry for Lea, especially when she sat up in her bed crying out his name, but my feelings about Cheri were mixed.  He was often cruel to his bride after Lea implored him to be kind to her, and he often skulked about like a child even when he was 25.Snotty back-handed compliments from the pretentious Charlotte are often sumultaneously humorous and infuriating; the story is both witty and and heartbreaking.  Gorgeous costumes, scenery, and the music are also splendid, adding oomph to a sometimes thin script, but that is such a minor aside.  If you like period films with an involving story, a decent cast, and plenty of beautiful eye candy, Cheri is a movie you'll want to see.  By the way, if you've never read any of Colette's works, the movie ends like The Last of Cheri.",5,Gorgeous Adaptation of Colette's Cheri Writings.,1326412800,"01 13, 2012",2012,1540,"['should', 'have', 'bought', 'months', 'when', 'had', 'chance', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Well', 'viewed', 'Netflix', 'last', 'night', 'fell', 'love', 'Having', 'only', 'begun', 'read', 'Colette', 'work', 'was', 'what', 'got', 'play', 'was', 'delightful.Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'who', 'aging', 'still', 'beautiful', 'courtesan', 'named', 'Lea', 'asked', 'fellow', 'prostitute', 'mother', 'Charlotte', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'Cathy', 'Bates', 'teach', '19', 'year-old', 'son', 'Cheri', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'ways', 'love', 'order', 'groom', 'be', 'suitable', 'marriage', 'Unfortunately', 'plan', 'when', 'unlikely', 'couple', 'fall', 'love', 'other', 'lifetime', 'heartache', 'young', 'man', 'young', 'wife', 'eventually', 'takes.I', 'felt', 'genuinely', 'sorry', 'Lea', 'especially', 'when', 'sat', 'up', 'bed', 'crying', 'out', 'name', 'feelings', 'Cheri', 'were', 'mixed', 'was', 'often', 'cruel', 'bride', 'Lea', 'implored', 'be', 'kind', 'often', 'skulked', 'child', 'even', 'when', 'was', '25.Snotty', 'back-handed', 'compliments', 'pretentious', 'Charlotte', 'are', 'often', 'sumultaneously', 'humorous', 'infuriating', 'story', 'witty', 'heartbreaking', 'Gorgeous', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'music', 'are', 'also', 'splendid', 'adding', 'oomph', 'sometimes', 'thin', 'script', 'minor', 'aside', 'like', 'period', 'films', 'involving', 'story', 'decent', 'cast', 'plenty', 'beautiful', 'eye', 'candy', 'Cheri', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'want', 'see', 'way', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'Colette', 'works', 'movie', 'Last', 'Cheri']",N/A

1273643,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002K0WBXM,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[5, 10]","In 2009, a French/British and German drama film titled ""Ch&eacute;ri"" was screened at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival.  The film is an adaptation of the novel from 1920 written by the French Novelist Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette or better known as Colette who is best known for her novel ""Gigi"" (which went on to inspire a film and musical).The film is directed by Stephen Frears (""The Queen"", ""Dangerous Liaisons"" and ""High Fidelity"") and features a screenplay written by Christopher Hampton (""Atonement"", ""Total Eclipse"" and ""Dangerous Liaisons"").  Joining Frears is cinematographer Darius Kohndji (""My Blueberry Nights"", ""The Ruins"", ""The Interpreter"") and composer Alexandre Desplat (""Julie & Julia"", ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", ""The Golden Compass"", ""Syriana"").The film takes place in Paris during the 1900s, at time when courtesans (prostitutes for the wealthy and powerful) were known for their celebrity like status and even setting the status quo of fashion during that era.  For Cheri (played by Rupert Friend, ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"", ""Pride and Prejudice"", ""The Last Legion""), he is an a 19-year-old man that has been spoiled by his mother former courtesan Madame Peloux (played by Kathy Bates, ""Misery"",""Titanic"", ""Fried Green Tomatoes"").  He has gotten everything he wanted but has not been satisfied with the many women that he has been with.That is until he goes off with Lea (played by Michelle Pfeiffer, ""Stardust"", ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"", ""Dangerous Liaisons""), a courtesan that has been around when Cheri was a young boy.  Because Cheri has always listened to ""Nunu"" (his nickname for ""Lea""), Madame Peloux asks her arch-rival Lea to take Cheri out on her vacation and teach him some things about real women.Needless to say, the two go of on vacation and have a sexual relationship in which the young 19-year-old starts to have a wonderful time with an older woman and for Lea, she gets a taste of youth.  A young man who doesn't want to grow up and an older woman who knows that she can't stay young forever. Both keep their fling in private for six years but despite their sexual liaison, life starts to change for both Lea and Cheri when Madame Peloux wants  grandchildren and thus her son Cheri is arranged to get married with a younger woman named Edmee (played by Felicity Jones, ""The Worst Witch"", ""Diary of Anne Frank"") from a rich family.And its when they spend their life away from each other, it is then that they learn for themselves that they truly love each other but due to circumstances (primarily their age) they can never truly be together...or can they?VIDEO & AUDIO:""Ch&eacute;ri""is presented in widescreen (2:35:1) and is enhanced for 169 television.  For the most part, capturing the look of an era through the hairstyles, costumes, the set design and the vehicles are done rather nicely.  Outdoor scenes are beautiful and vibrant but the beauty of the film revolves around the look and feel of the film.As for audio, the film is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  For the most part, the film is dialogue and music driven, so mostly front and center channel usage throughout the film.  If there were surround sound usage, possibly during the train whistling but for a film like this, audio is satisfactory and dialogue is clear and understandable.Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Ch&eacute;ri"" comes with the following special features:* The Making of Ch&eacute;ri - (8:50) The making of ""Ch&eacute;ri"" and an interview with the director, crew and the talent about the film, Colette and the set and costume design.* Deleted Scenes - Two deleted scenes titled ""Turpentine"" (:21) and ""Never"" (1:49).JUDGMENT CALL:For the most part, ""Ch&eacute;ri"" is a film that I felt was average at best.  I can easily compliment the look of the film through its wonderful costume and set design.  I can also compliment how Michelle Pfeiffer looks absolutely incredible now as she was when she first appeared in film but part of the problem that I have with the film is that we know the film takes place in Paris.  You have Rupert Friend who fits the part with his accent but then we have Michelle Pfeiffer as Lea and Kathy Bates as Madame Peloux.  Both are fine actresses but for this film, I just have this nagging feeling that they were miscast.I suppose that if you have one main actor with his European accent (and other talents in the film with their accents), you would expect the same with the film's two major talents.  Sure, Kathy Bates talks with a slight accent and Pfeiffer with none but with the film capturing that look and feel of early Paris, you would think that casting could have done the same.  Again, as talented as both women are, personally I felt the casting was off for both characters.  But despite that little quip that I have towards the film, I have to give Michelle Pfeiffer her due in showing a woman who has managed to become a successful business woman but deep inside you sense that loneliness which Pfeiffer manages to portray quite well with her facial expressions.The other thing that I have the problem with the film is that it captures part of the Colette's novel.  There is one primary section that deals with war and another section that deals with Cheri revisiting Lea that is not shown in the film.  It would have been interesting to capture that moment from the novel but alas, the film's goal was to focus on two people in love, but due to their age...one born many years early and one too young to learn that what he had was the best thing he would ever have.There are no surprises, to me there was no uplifting climax.  The film is straightforward and for the most part, just average.",3,"Featuring beautiful set and costume design capturing 19th Century Paris, `Ch&eacute;ri` is a film that is very much an average

1273644,A3HM5G9IV1FTFP,B002K0WBXM,Douglas King,"[4, 5]","*** 1/2With ""Cheri"", Michelle Pfeiffer returns to the period drama genre that has served her so well in the past (""Dangerous Liaisons"", ""The Age of Innocence""). This time, rather than play the innocent or unattainable object of desire, Pfeiffer plays Lea, an aging, semi-retired courtesan having a May-December romance with the son of her friend.Pfeiffer, one of my all-time favorite actresses, plays Lea as a woman who has spent her life choosing wealth, freedom, and privilege over genuine relationships. She's not cruel or heartless, but more of a composed, world-weary realist whose experience has taught her how to manipulate most situations to her advantage using charm and her still considerable beauty. Madame Peloux (the always formidable Kathy Bates), Lea's longtime friend and another retired courtesan, may not have maintained her stunning youthful beauty, but is perhaps more manipulative and shrewd than Lea. When Peloux's 19 year old son, Cheri, is becoming too troublesome, Peloux is shrewd enough to take advantage of the mutual attraction shared between Cheri and Lea, knowing that Lea will help refine the boy and teach him what he needs to know to become a good husband for the right girl. Lea and Cheri enter into a relationship meant to be casual, but end up living together happily for six years. Unfortunately, the two's unconventional relationship is threatened when Peloux decides that it's time for the boy to marry a young girl and give her grandchildren.Rupert Friend seems to be getting mixed reviews for his performance, but I thought he did quite well. He plays Cheri with the appropriate mannerisms of a beautiful, fatherless, neglected young man who's spent his life surrounded by privilege and debauchery. And despite their age difference, Friend and Pfeiffer share enough chemistry and heat to make the film's central relationship believable.The performances are all good, and the art direction is sumptuous, making the film very lovely to look at. The script and direction are just adequate, however, making this a decent film, but not a great one. As in all period pieces, the Mise-en-sc&egrave;ne is of a different era, but the themes are timeless. The characters in ""Cheri"" struggle with familiar human things ... being true to themselves vs. fulfilling the expectations put upon them, the sacrifices made for wealth and luxury, and the fleetingness (and benefits) of youth and beauty.",3,Timeless themes and a timeless beauty,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,2425,"['***', '1/2With', 'Cheri', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'period', 'drama', 'genre', 'served', 'so', 'well', 'past', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'Age', 'Innocence', 'time', 'rather', 'play', 'innocent', 'unattainable', 'object', 'desire', 'Pfeiffer', 'Lea', 'aging', 'semi-retired', 'courtesan', 'having', 'May-December', 'romance', 'son', 'friend.Pfeiffer', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'actresses', 'plays', 'Lea', 'woman', 'who', 'spent', 'life', 'choosing', 'wealth', 'freedom', 'privilege', 'genuine', 'relationships', 'not', 'cruel', 'heartless', 'more', 'composed', 'world-weary', 'realist', 'experience', 'taught', 'how', 'manipulate', 'most', 'situations', 'advantage', 'using', 'charm', 'still', 'considerable', 'beauty', 'Madame', 'Peloux', 'always', 'formidable', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Lea', 'longtime', 'friend', 'retired', 'courtesan', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'maintained', 'stunning', 'youthful', 'beauty', 'perhaps', 'more', 'manipulative', 'shrewd', 'Lea', 'When', 'Peloux', '19', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Cheri', 'becoming', 'too', 'troublesome', 'Peloux', 'shrewd', 'enough', 'take', 'advantage', 'mutual', 'attraction', 'shared', 'Cheri', 'Lea', 'knowing', 'Lea', 'will', 'help', 'refine', 'boy', 'teach', 'what', 'know', 'become', 'good', 'husband', 'right', 'girl', 'Lea', 'Cheri', 'enter', 'relationship', 'meant', 'be', 'casual', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'together', 'happily', 'six', 'years', 'Unfortunately', 'two', 'unconventional', 'relationship', 'threatened', 'when', 'Peloux', 'time', 'boy', 'marry', 'young', 'girl', 'give', 'grandchildren.Rupert', 'Friend', 'be', 'getting', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'performance', 'thought', 'did', 'quite', 'well', 'Cheri', 'appropriate', 'mannerisms', 'beautiful', 'fatherless', 'neglected', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'spent', 'life', 'surrounded', 'privilege', 'debauchery', 'age', 'difference', 'Friend', 'Pfeiffer', 'share', 'enough', 'chemistry', 'heat', 'make', 'film', 'central', 'relationship', 'believable.The', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'art', 'direction', 'sumptuous', 'making', 'film', 'very', 'lovely', 'look', 'script', 'direction', 'are', 'just', 'adequate', 'however', 'making', 'decent', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'period', 'pieces', 'Mise-en-sc', 'egrave', 'different', 'era', 'themes', 'are', 'timeless', 'characters', 'Cheri', 'struggle', 'familiar', 'human', 'things', 'being', 'true', 'fulfilling', 'expectations', 'put', 'sacrifices', 'made', 'wealth', 'luxury', 'fleetingness', 'benefits', 'youth', 'beauty']",N/A
1273645,A3NK6P0QFDUZL2,B002K0WBXM,G. Charles Steiner,"[24, 25]","This film is fine.  It belongs in the canon of great movie classics because it stays thematically true to Colette's vision of a culture full of witty flippancy without sacrificing the profundities of love and intimate bonding between two people.  I agree with many reviewers that Michelle Pfeiffer may appear too thin (although quite lovely to look at) or that Kathy Bates overacts and doesn't seem well-suited for her part.  But these flaws are small and trivial in comparison to the huge canvas on screen showing the historical Age of the Belle Epoque and revealing the central drama of love between an older, experienced woman and courtesan and an innocent but hedonistic young man.  What Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Friend manage to create together on screen is the love that Colette wanted her readers to understand and experience, however odd and even tasteless it may seem on first glance, and that love story unfolds beautifully on screen, although tragically, for both.  It's a memorable film and makes you want to read Colette's novels.  It was also quite lovely to experience vicariously two people on screen loving each other throughout difficulties and watch them sensually appreciate the loveliness of each other's looks as well, directly, without pretense, tenderly and without reserve, where the outer and the inner person for the other were one.",4,Thematically True and Tragic,1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,1363,"['film', 'fine', 'canon', 'great', 'movie', 'classics', 'thematically', 'true', 'Colette', 'vision', 'culture', 'full', 'witty', 'flippancy', 'sacrificing', 'profundities', 'love', 'intimate', 'bonding', 'two', 'people', 'agree', 'many', 'reviewers', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'may', 'appear', 'too', 'thin', 'quite', 'lovely', 'look', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'overacts', ""n't"", 'seem', 'well-suited', 'part', 'flaws', 'are', 'small', 'trivial', 'comparison', 'huge', 'canvas', 'screen', 'showing', 'historical', 'Age', 'Belle', 'Epoque', 'revealing', 'central', 'drama', 'love', 'older', 'experienced', 'woman', 'courtesan', 'innocent', 'hedonistic', 'young', 'man', 'What', 'Michelle', 'Pfeiffer', 'Rupert', 'Friend', 'manage', 'create', 'together', 'screen', 'love', 'Colette', 'wanted', 'readers', 'understand', 'experience', 'however', 'odd', 'even', 'tasteless', 'may', 'seem', 'first', 'glance', 'love', 'story', 'unfolds', 'beautifully', 'screen', 'tragically', 'memorable', 'film', 'want', 'read', 'Colette', 'novels', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'lovely', 'experience', 'vicariously', 'two', 'people', 'screen', 'loving', 'other', 'difficulties', 'watch', 'sensually', 'appreciate', 'loveliness', 'other', 'looks', 'well', 'directly', 'pretense', 'tenderly', 'reserve', 'where', 'outer', 'inner', 'person', 'other', 'were', 'one']",N/A

And the reasons why this happened remain obscure.The story is simple: courtesans in Paris must eventually retire form their lives of becoming wealthy through pleasing men of the higher class, and either they live out their lives in the luxuries of fluff or they must confront their aging and feel pangs of remorse as they end their lives alone, without a man to bolster them. Lea de Lonval (Michelle Pfeiffer) has been longtime 'friends' with Madame Peloux (Kathy Bates), even to the point of nurturing Madame's son Ch&eacute;ri (Rupert Friend) as he approaches manhood.  Madame asks Lea to 'polish' Ch&eacute;ri for other women and after what might have been a brief fling in Normandy, the young Ch&eacute;ri and the aging Lea fall into a six year  relationship.  But as Madame realizes she needs grandchildren, she eventually finds a proper girl Edmee (Felicity Jones) for Ch&eacute;ri to marry.  The remainder of the story is how these two age-disparate characters adapt to the 'social rules' of La Belle Epoque, suggesting that even under extraordinary circumstances the power of love is an issue that must be confronted.Despite the performances by Pfeiffer and Friend (and even the miscast Bates) the story feels somehow sterile.  Perhaps it is the out of place use of a male narrator who gives the film an unnecessary feeling of being a documentary, or the somewhat overused musical score of Alexandre Desplat, or the emphasis on costumes that hardly add to the beauty of Pfeiffer as Lea that keep the production grounded.  It is a pleasant enough film, but hardly a memorable one.

Here we have an aging but still beautiful courtesan who has made it this far in life without letting herself slip into the pitfall of actually falling in love.

The relationship between Lea and Cheri (Rupert Friend) is never developed properly in the beginning - in fact it feels quite rushed and forced, so you never get a sense of connection between these two  from the start. They also have virtually nothing in the way of on-screen chemistry. Rupert Friend turns in a one-dimensional portrait of a dark and brooding Cheri...the other actors, with the exception of Kathy Bates, are instantly forgettable. Shame too because the staging is lovely and this is probably one of Pfieffer's best performances. Overdubbed narration offers entirely unncessary commentary on what's going on in the minds of the characters, and utterly undermines every attempt the film makes to build and maintain a sense of real drama.

The pacing is odd. First it's really languid, then the last ten minutes or so are crowded with intensity. It was really jarring. The fame and wealth of a high priced courtesan was not really illustrated here. They looked like faded pretenders rather than sought-after women of power and intrigue. They looked like caricatures.The movie was interesting enough for me to read the book and watch it again. This time I saw the lovely costumes and settings, the rich detail and the love story itself. It felt a lot more touching this time around. Cheri does a great job at being spoiled and vapid. It's hard to imagine someone so lacking in depth could feel love, but when it happens, it is convincing.

I wasn't really expecting much because I'm honestly just not a fan of michelle pfeiffer, but surprisingly, this movie follows the book very well, and also captures the overall mood and tone of the story. I wouldn't say that this movie as a whole is really good, it can be bland at times, and for some reason I found the annoying ""narrator"" very distracting, but Michelle definitely embodied the role and so did the male actor who played Cheri. Planning to read the book again, but not the movie so much, just because I find it somewhat forgettable.

After all the research I've done on prostitution, mistresses, lorettes, and the like, it was interesting to see the life of an aging, though gorgeous, woman in that profession.She falls in love with the son of another former courtesan, whose is as rich as her, from their years of sexual trysts with high society men and aristocrats.  Actually, it's quite true, that women of these types were quite wealthy in their own right, as their benefactors showered them with money and jewels to be their mistresses.  It was not uncommon for mistresses to accompany their benefactors, with their wives, even to public entertainment, such as the Opera, etc.  It was just the way things were.But what happens to those women when they age?  Well, Cheri, is a good example of one woman clinging to her youth through a man old enough to be her own son.  She let's herself fall in love, when she really knows better, and so does he.  The outcome of their love is heartbreaking, and I can thoroughly understand desperately a woman who wants to keep their attractive youth and need to be desired.As far as the movie itself and acting, I have to give it three stars.
