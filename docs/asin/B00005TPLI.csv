Some of it will work for you, some will go flat, and the parts that work are different for different people. (My favorite bit is Paul Rudd's ridiculous pout at having to clean up a mess. No kidding.) But there's plenty to laugh at, and it's very entertaining seeing so many really big stars (now: I assume most were minor players at the time) all thrown together in such a B-grade movie. This doesn't have the 5-star polish of the truly classic silly movies, like ""Airplane!"" or ""Animal House"".

Estes,"[1, 2]","A gay marriage in the woods, the confessions of canned vegetables, a drug-induced day-trip to a local town, multiple children drowning and a talent show are just some of the events that make up the day-in-the-life of 2001's ""Wet Hot American Summer."" Written and directed by alumni of MTV's mid-90's sketch comedy show ""The State,"" the film is host to one of the best ensemble casts a comedy has seen in at least a decade and an off-beat sense of humor that has solidified its status as a cult classic.The film takes place at a fictional summer camp in Maine in 1981. It's the last day of camp, and everyone is scrambling to find love and lust. Throughout the film, we follow an array of wacky and zany characters, brought to life by such talent as David Hyde Pierce, Christopher Meloni, Janeane Garofalo, Bradley Cooper, Molly Shannon, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Ian Black and Marguerite Moreau.  Meloni plays against his ""Law & Order"" type and gets some of the biggest laughs of the show, but Rudd isn't far behind with his apathetic and child-like performance. The writing is as off-the-wall as expected, with the plot taking left-turns at unexpected points, giving way to gigantic laughs from bizarre situations and ridiculous sight-gags.The film wasn't very successful upon its release, and most critics hated it, but over time, it has earned its spot as one of best comedies of the decade and is a testament to the power of comedy when it is without restraint or reservation. In short, it's a coming of age movie that can double as a stoner flick.

I was immediately pulled in by the hilarious absurdity of the scene (one of the camp counselors jumps out of a raft of kid campers and leaves them drifting down the river so that he can fetch another camp counselor who knows how to better navigate the waters and is running back to camp with plans to get laid).  Everything is so ridiculously funny; it leaves your face hurting from smiling and laughing!  Because of the 80's theme, I initially thought that this was an older movie that I had somehow missed.  It initially reminded me of some of Monty Python's work (e.g. in &quot;The Holy Grail&quot; when the dark knight loses one limb after the other yet continues to live and fight).

682279,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00005TPLI,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[0, 2]","If you are old enough to remember the summer camp movies of the late 70's - early 80's, or discovered them thanks to video and cable, then you will probably get into this 2001 spoof on the genre. You'll understand what things mean. If you are oblivious to ""Meatballs"" and the ilk, then stay far away from this movie, unless you have an open mind. It's odd, but also hysterical and spot on. The movie centers around the last day at camp at Camp Firewood, circa 1981. The camp councelors are planning on the best day ever, which will also conclude with a talent show at the end of the day. In the meantime, we are introduced to a slew of oddball characters, each with their own thing. The camp director is played by Janeane Garofalo, who has the hots for a science professor living nearby, who is played by ""Frasier"" star David Hyde-Pierce. Then there is the typical shallow, ladies man creep councelor played by Paul Rudd(""Clueless""), who is more occupied with the ladies and making out than he is with being a councelor, which would explain why some of his charges have a nasty habit of drowning(which is hysterical in it's own right). It doesn't stop there. The usual cliches we see in these films are all played out here. There's the cool cat guy with sex on his mind who's always bragging about the women he's been with; The total dweebs with Dungeons And Dragons on their minds who are referred to as the 'indoor kids', and so on. Then there's the story of the nerdy guy who has the hots for the sexiest girl at camp, but she is with the Paul Rudd character. We saw this coming, but so did the filmmakers, and that's just part of the spoof. The hot girl who gets to know the nerd and realizes that he's the one for her. I've saved the best for last. Christopher Meloni(""Runaway Bride"", ""Law And Order:SVU""), plays Gene, the rough, shell shocked vietnam vet, who is the camp chef. He's the best of the bunch. Coming across as all butch and a tough guy, but always let's slip at the end of something he says that makes one wonder about how 'manly' he is. It's laugh out loud funny. There's more, but I'll save it for you to find out. What I like about this movie is how it really seems like a 1981 summer camp movie. The kids here were all well picked out. They look like normal, average kids that you would always find in the movies this one is making fun of. The girls are cute, but not overly pretty. The nerds really look like genuine nerds. It isn't like today's movies where the kids would normally be tremendous looking and seem to of just stepped out of a show on the WB. Not that I'm knocking that. They are all good too. The movie does lose steam towards the end and starts to unravel at the seams. It becomes quite odd, really. It didn't fit with the rest of the film at all. The actors all deliver perfect, dead on comedic performances. They all seem to really know what they are doing and what they are going for. It's obvious that this was probably a fun movie to make. I must warn you about an out there sex scene in the film. It's not what you were expecting, or wanted to see. Let me just say that it's not m/f. Also be on the lookout for a dandy of a scene involving councelors having a good time going into town. Again, like the sex scene, it's not the happy, fun time montage you would of thought you would be seeing. The movie was basically unoticed and most people don't know it even exists, but it's one of those secret, unheard of films that will gain a definite cult following.

Michael Showalter (who co-wrote the film) is reasonably funny as the gawky counselor protagonist, and he's joined by the uniformly amusing Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon, David Hyde Pierce, Janeane Garofolo, and Michael Ian Black.A lot of care went into giving the film a sense of place as a summer camp in 1981, which, along with the ruthlessly gratuitous soundtrack, gives it the right nostalgic flavor.

As the reviews show, this is a movie that you either love or hate.As some of the negative reviews have mentioned, there is a major lack of continuity in this film. This is something that made it really funny, in my opinion, and I would be willing to bet that those people didn't even notice exactly how much blatant discontinuity there was. In one particular scene, a character returns from a short trip with long, raggedy hair to talk to another character, and when the camera returns to him after she says something, his hair is at the length it was when he left. Just a couple minutes later, a similar thing happens with another character, even more obvious this time. I don't know about you, but I thought that was quite funny.What I think is a problem for those who don't like this movie is that they expect some blunt parody of the 80's camp movies, when it really isn't. I think it revels in the genre but isn't really trying to directly mock it like Scary Movie did to horror movies. While there is definite parody in it, much of it is simply demented, nonsensical fun. I found the lack of consistent parallels refreshing, and it kept the movie interesting. And you have to really pay attention to it, because there is subtle humor strewn throughout.I will say that I was a fan of The State in its days, but I had no idea that the people from that show had anything to do with this movie at the time I'd rented it. I just knew some people who thought it was funny. I also was never into 80's camp movies. So you don't have to be really knowledgeable of that genre to enjoy this.

The gist of the story centered on how they attempted to shop the film around and met with collective indifference from the distributors.  When they did find a distributor it was only barely released.  Most critics, notably Roger Ebert, savaged it.  It took years for the film to develope a cult of devoted followers who can recite dialogue from the film verbatim.  I kind of get it.  ""Wet Hot American Summer"" anticipates the kinder, gentler raunch that became the stock-in-trade of Judd Apatow and Todd Philips.  It took me a while to get attuned to the film's sensibility.

However, it's one of the smartest satires of a film genre I've ever seen.

Don't make that mistake; it's intented to be bad. And when the film goes off on surrealistic tangents -- the trip to town, the disposing of bodies -- it still works, because the film has set up its premise so well. So buy and enjoy. Paul Rudd's performance as the bad guy/stud is so perfect it merits some kind of award. The scene where he has to pick up the plate he's just thrown on the ground is a masterpiece of pantomime. He so disgusted ast having to do it, that he &quot;machos&quot; all over the room. And the music, especially the &quot;fire, desire, higher and higher&quot; song, is hilarious.

Despite a lot of great people in the cast, practically nothing in the film works. The problem isn't just the script, even though it's almost entirely witless. Scene to scene, the pacing and tone is oddly off, and jokes and entire sequences just fall flat. The director favors Wellesian low-angle close-ups that anesthetize rather than enliven the comedy, such as it is. It's difficult to tell exactly what they were going for here. A parody of 80s summer camp movies? (As if a harmless, decades old sub-genre was just begging for skewering.) Or is it meant to be a straight-up modern comedy version of those films? Or is it meant as an exercise in absurdism that uses summer camp and teen sex comedies as a taking-off point? Some combination of the three? None of the above? Characters, ideas and sub-plots are dropped into the narrative here and there to no particular purpose and often go nowhere. Most puzzling, perhaps is the semi-graphic gay sex scene. It's not played for laughs (not that it necessarily should be) and it doesn't lead to anything. There are a few chuckles here and there, but basically WHAS is almost bizarrely unfunny.

Or, was it an attempt to make a deliberately bad film, and label it ""ironic""?  Either way, the film has some of the most indifferent, atrocious acting you're ever likely to see.

In the featurette, the directors Michael Showalter and David Wain, say they were drunk during most of the shoot, and it shows.  Indifferent performances, horrible direction, continuity errors (like Janeane's character standing on a taped, yellow ""X"", hair styles changing in the same shot, hands changing in a simple two shot), and an appalling lack of professionalism sink this film early and it never recovers.

Many illustrious titles were to come from this: Meatballs, Camp Nowhere, Heavyweights, uhh... Meatballs II, and probably some other ones.Then there's this movie. This movie has taken all that's been made of every kids camp/sports movie, mixed with every teen David/Goliath drama, and kicked it in the nuts. The cheese presented in this movie was gourmet, in that it was obviously obvious to the viewer, except those that pointed out how cheesy this movie was/is.A couple of instances. I loved the whole nerdy counseler in love with the hot, out of his league female counserlor. She's in love with the hot yet distant Paul Rudd. She says she loves him, he says his butt itches; she says she'll see him later, he gives her the finger; oh, then they make out, alot. The nerdy counseler, Coop, is convinced that he and katie, the counselor, are kindred spirits. In the classic teen fashion, Coop even spills his guts and tells her at great length that he loves her. The only thing that was missing was the stereo hoisted over his head. Eventually, on the night of the talent show, Katie comes around. She realizes that she loves Coop, but what happens the next morning?Oh, and let's not forget Gene, the cook. Story goes that Gene fought in the Vietnam war, and he was not quite over it. He has some deranged post-war antics. Whether it's fonduing cheddar (fondling his sweaters) or seeing his buds in class (smearing mud on his a*s), Gene's hair-trigger mood is one of the highlights of this movie.Probably the worst synopsis you ever heard. Just buy the movie.

682316,A3LY9ZWBRC7QS5,B00005TPLI,Olaf Johnson,"[0, 0]","I think all the 1 star reviews are by people who never went to or worked at a summer camp and all te 5 star reviews are by those who have. Being in the latter catergory myself (as a camper, counselor and program specialist at a sleep away camp in New York state in the 1990s) I must say I enjoyed this movie. It nails every aspect of the darker side of sleep away summer camp life of the 1980s and 1990s down from the lovestruck camp director to ignorant water front staff to the trip into town to wedding by the lake to secret gay staffers to loony kitchen staff to even the big talent show.Most viewers need to understand that this movie takes place on the final day of camp where anything goes because you can't be fired or kicked out unless you do something stupid like film yourself committing self pleasure. lol. When we saw this movie in 2001 it was because Shannon, Garafalo and Pierce was in it and now seeing it in 2011 I was charmed to find that a young skinny Poehler along with Rudd, Cooper and Banks were in this as well. All of whom I didn't know in 2001 but broke out and played vital roles in the Hollywood comedy scene over the last decade.Praise aside this movie does have it flaws and it is mainly in the script and dialogue. At times you can't distinguish whether they are doing a paradoy or it is just bad writing (like the scene where Garafalo is being told about Hair Moose). At best it could be just a social disconnect between 1981, 2001 and 2011. Also the most important thing about the last day of summer camp in my experience was that there was plot somewhere by someone to do something big (beyond sex or talent shows)to be remembered and this movie missed that point by not having a real plot. Because of that it wasn't as funny as it could have been. I also expected more pranking as a big part of the last day of camp. What makes this movie a gem is that summer camps in 2011 are so sanitized and structured that this movie may not be a parody to someone younger than 24 but a bad fiction or awkward comedy.

Well, I am admittedly no huge fan of lowbrow late 70's/early 80's sex-comedies, so perhaps I'm biased, but the bulk of this film seemed predictable and trite.

Sure, I found myself ""getting"" the jokes, but most of my laughter came at the expense of a well-timed F-word, not any genuine appreciation of the attempt at humor.In a strange way, the movie almost turns on itself, as the viewer gets so accustomed to expect the unexpected.  In parody, it isn't good enough to simply reference earlier material, but that's ultimately what happens in this film: scene after scene cobbled together, as if a group of aging Gen-X'ers were sitting around a rec-room reminiscing about how ""those geeks always hated camp!"" or ""those jock guys were always hooking up with those slutty girls!""

682327,A3LXKO2S6G2DBI,B00005TPLI,"Stephen Kaczmarek ""Educator, Writer, Consultant""","[4, 6]","Hollywood likes to pretend the early 1980s -- when tight clothes, natural hair, and a laid back attitude were more common than throughout the rest of that narcissistic, self-indulgent decade -- never really existed.  ""Wet, Hot Summer"" wants to remind us of the more interesting half of Reagan's era, parodying two genres, the raunchy teen comedy and the summer camp movie.In both cases, the film mostly works, managing to both evoke the look and feel of those films while also offering a nostalgic peek into the time period.  This is one of the few films about the 1980s that actually gets the hair and clothing styles right, as well as the attitudes of teens and preteens.  As breezy as the films it parodies, ""Wet, Hot Summer"" relies less on a rigid plot and more on a series of episodes featuring a slew of characters who hook up, break up, and repeat the pattern as necessary, all to a soundtrack that includes Rick Springfield, Foreigner, and Loverboy.  Indeed, scenes often play out more like ""Mad"" magazine parodies, right down to funny non-sequiturs and layers of jokes that make for repeat viewings.The best storylines concern the awkward romance between the camp director (Jeaneane Garofalo) and a timid astronomer (David Hyde Pierce), though the ongoing soap opera involving a beefy jerk (Paul Rudd), his shallow admirer (Marguerite Moreau), and the sensitive goof who loves her (Michael Showalter) gets credit for being brutally honest.  The rest of the cast is mostly unknowns or sketch comedy vets, like the kooky but cute Amy Poehler and the kooky but unnerving Molly Shannon, but Christopher Meloni (who could play Bert if they ever film a version of ""Sesame Street's"" Bert and Ernie) gets to pull an Ed O'Neill as the unstable Viet Nam vet stereotype.The first half of the film stays more or less grounded (in fact, the opening credit sequence and first 15 minutes could have been lifted from an actual early 80s film); the second half takes the humor and story to far more exaggerated levels, involving, among other things, telekinesis and Skylab.  Those of us who came through the decade will probably feel nostalgic, while younger generations will no doubt chuckle at the silliness of it all, if they aren't simply rolling their eyes.  The ironic thing is that in making a spoof, director David Wain managed to capture many of the low-budget delights that made those films watchable, right down to the tight camera angles and the schmaltzy center.

This movie is so ahead of its time, it's hard to believe that it came out nearly 15 years ago. You will recognize so many of your favorite actors and funny people doing their best work. There are so many jokes packed into every scene that each viewing will bring something new to your attention. It manages to be both delightfully raunchy and truly affecting.

This flick really is geared squarely towards gen-x'ers; it attempts to recreate the look, feel, and attitude of the eighties (and does so perfectly in my opinion), while at the same time it pokes fun at a decade that really was, well... silly.The whole falling SkyLab thing was hysterical to me; I can remember being in junior-high and having science teachers talk about the decaying orbit of SkyLab, and being sure it was going to land on my house(!).Hindsight is what makes much of this movie funny. It's funny because in 1983, this movie, with very little adjustment, could have been released as one of the movies that it mocks.
