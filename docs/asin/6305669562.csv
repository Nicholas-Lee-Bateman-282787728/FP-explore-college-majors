472643,A2J18HGXQVBVOR,6305669562,"Angela Hailey ""sableskin""","[1, 2]","Sweepers is a poignant movie told against hauntingly beautiful music and breathtaking scenery.  It is the story of land mines in Africa.  It stars Dolph Lundgen as Christian Erickson, a haunted mine sweeper who decides to leave the service following the death of his son.  Claire Stansfield plays Michelle Flynn, a congressional investigator and scientist.  The story revolves around the ""new"" triangle trade of weapons, diamonds, and profit.  Although the movie may appear to be a basic shoot-em-up, I found it to be much more intelligent than that.  Even at his most manly moments, Lundgren never descends into simple savagery for the sake of doing so.  His words always seem to reflect the intellect that one would expect of a mine sweeper, and the sentimentality of any parent  trying to cope with the grief of burying his son.  Claire Stansfield portrays a truly refreshing heroine.  She is an intelligent, talented woman who knows what information she wants, and is willing to get it.  She's not to be ignored, or sent on wild goose chases, and clearly feels responsible for the unintended consequences of the proliferation of a weapon she helped to create.  She is no TSTL (Too Stupid to Live) ""damsel"", and doesn't feel that the ""hero"" should have to do ALL of the heavy lifting.  Most importantly, she's not afraid to get a little dirty, and when its time to move! she does so without asking a lot of unnecessary questions.Although the acting stumbles in a few places, the flow of the movie is fairly consistent.  When I saw the headliner (Lundgren), I was expecting another testosterone-packed Rocky IV/Universal Soldier creation.  I was mistaken, and pleasantly so.  The artistry of the movie, the timeliness of the storyline, and the intelligence of the plot truly impressed me.  There are no strange lapses in time, and no anomalous jumps in location to leave the viewer's forehead wrinkled in confusion.  That said, the movie has a wonderful soundtrack which mixes some African elements and songs with strong symphonic movements.  The cinematography alone is spectacular. The movie is not meant to be a primer on the problem of landmines and never makes any such claim.  It does offer some contextual information at both the beginning and the end, enough to encourage individual research.Many movies about Africa, particularly those of Western production, focus on a few white [enlightened] people in a mostly[backwards] African country.  It leaves one with the feeling that the African people are background to the more important white people, and in fact, that all Africans are disenfranchised and all whites motivated by beneficence.  In this film, we see a more balanced approach that more closely approximates all people, i.e., that greed and avarice are truly found across the spectrum.I stumbled across this movie in a value bin a few years ago, and I have continued to give it as a stocking stuffer ever since.  I never get tired of watching it, and I am glad to share such a touching and inspiring piece of work about a little understood topic with as many as I can.",5,WHAT A BARGAIN!,1194998400,"11 14, 2007",2007,3089,"['Sweepers', 'poignant', 'movie', 'told', 'hauntingly', 'beautiful', 'music', 'breathtaking', 'scenery', 'story', 'land', 'mines', 'Africa', 'Dolph', 'Lundgen', 'Christian', 'Erickson', 'haunted', 'mine', 'sweeper', 'who', 'leave', 'service', 'following', 'death', 'son', 'Claire', 'Stansfield', 'Michelle', 'Flynn', 'congressional', 'investigator', 'scientist', 'story', 'new', 'triangle', 'trade', 'weapons', 'diamonds', 'profit', 'movie', 'may', 'appear', 'be', 'basic', 'shoot-em-up', 'found', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'intelligent', 'Even', 'most', 'manly', 'moments', 'Lundgren', 'never', 'simple', 'savagery', 'sake', 'doing', 'so', 'words', 'always', 'seem', 'reflect', 'intellect', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'mine', 'sweeper', 'sentimentality', 'parent', 'trying', 'cope', 'grief', 'burying', 'son', 'Claire', 'Stansfield', 'truly', 'refreshing', 'heroine', 'intelligent', 'talented', 'woman', 'who', 'what', 'information', 'willing', 'get', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'sent', 'wild', 'goose', 'chases', 'clearly', 'feels', 'responsible', 'unintended', 'consequences', 'proliferation', 'weapon', 'helped', 'create', 'TSTL', 'Too', 'Stupid', 'Live', 'damsel', ""n't"", 'feel', 'hero', 'should', 'have', 'do', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'Most', 'importantly', 'not', 'afraid', 'get', 'little', 'dirty', 'when', 'time', 'move', 'so', 'asking', 'lot', 'unnecessary', 'acting', 'stumbles', 'few', 'places', 'flow', 'movie', 'fairly', 'consistent', 'When', 'saw', 'headliner', 'Lundgren', 'was', 'expecting', 'testosterone-packed', 'Rocky', 'IV/Universal', 'Soldier', 'creation', 'was', 'mistaken', 'pleasantly', 'so', 'artistry', 'movie', 'timeliness', 'storyline', 'intelligence', 'plot', 'truly', 'impressed', 'are', 'strange', 'lapses', 'time', 'anomalous', 'jumps', 'location', 'leave', 'viewer', 'forehead', 'wrinkled', 'confusion', 'said', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'soundtrack', 'African', 'elements', 'songs', 'strong', 'symphonic', 'movements', 'cinematography', 'alone', 'spectacular', 'movie', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'primer', 'problem', 'landmines', 'never', 'such', 'claim', 'offer', 'contextual', 'information', 'beginning', 'end', 'enough', 'encourage', 'individual', 'research.Many', 'movies', 'Africa', 'particularly', 'Western', 'production', 'focus', 'few', 'white', '[', 'enlightened', ']', 'people', 'mostly', '[', 'backwards', ']', 'African', 'country', 'one', 'feeling', 'African', 'people', 'are', 'background', 'more', 'important', 'white', 'people', 'fact', 'Africans', 'are', 'disenfranchised', 'whites', 'motivated', 'beneficence', 'film', 'see', 'more', 'balanced', 'approach', 'more', 'closely', 'people', 'i.e.', 'greed', 'avarice', 'are', 'truly', 'found', 'spectrum.I', 'stumbled', 'movie', 'value', 'bin', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'have', 'continued', 'give', 'stocking', 'stuffer', 'ever', 'never', 'get', 'tired', 'watching', 'am', 'glad', 'share', 'touching', 'inspiring', 'piece', 'work', 'little', 'understood', 'topic', 'as', 'many', 'can']",N/A

Whether or not you like Dolph or his acting, this movie is relevant and politically correct. It starts out pretty slow but ends with lots of action and has a couple of surprises in it. Dolph and his costar (Clarie Stansfield) look really good.  The problems with the film are that Dolph's voice sounds like he had larangitus during the filming and the landmine they are in search of is supposed to be very sophisticated technology but is really kind of pathetic. On the other hand, in real life, by the time you get as close to a landmine as Dolph's character does in this movie, you are already dead or have at least lost a limb.",4,Politically Correct Dolph,980467200,"01 26, 2001",2001,709,"['respect', 'movie', 'problem', 'landmines', 'Africa', 'Whether', 'not', 'like', 'Dolph', 'acting', 'movie', 'relevant', 'politically', 'correct', 'out', 'pretty', 'slow', 'lots', 'action', 'couple', 'surprises', 'Dolph', 'costar', 'Clarie', 'Stansfield', 'look', 'really', 'good', 'problems', 'film', 'are', 'Dolph', 'voice', 'sounds', 'had', 'larangitus', 'filming', 'landmine', 'are', 'search', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'sophisticated', 'technology', 'really', 'kind', 'pathetic', 'other', 'hand', 'real', 'life', 'time', 'get', 'close', 'landmine', 'Dolph', 'character', 'movie', 'are', 'already', 'dead', 'have', 'least', 'lost', 'limb']",N/A

I mean it's obscure, but not in a cool new find way. Perhaps it's due to bad writing and directing but it just seems so different in terms of dialogue and plot development. For most of the movie Dolph sits around and drinks but after about an hour he finally gets down to some action.He also sounds different. His voice is gravelly. Like he's smoked 100 cigars a day for a decade. But I guess this is him just getting into character, too bad it's not interesting but it's nice to see the effort. There should plenty for Dolph to get his teeth into here and lots of opportunity for a hot-potato of a movie. Land mines are a delicate issue but at some point in the movie it all collapses into standard action-man territory.The beginning is badly directed, some shootouts seems really false and the trailer is, by far, the WORST I have ever seen. The DVD has plain old stereo sound with a pan and scanned fullscreen picture.
