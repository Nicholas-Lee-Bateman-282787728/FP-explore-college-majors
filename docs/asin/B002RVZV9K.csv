1286033,A6JJ7CD3RN1W5,B002RVZV9K,a writer,"[0, 0]","""It Might Get Loud"" does the work of several documentaries. On its surface it's a staged meeting between three iconic guitarists from three distinct eras. But it's also three biographies in miniature of three individuals who were shaped by, and helped to shape, the music that we know as rock and roll. For purists there are tantalizing glimpses of musical inspiration, obscure and otherwise, and for those who simply love the look and sound of rock, there's enough detail about the guitar to delight anyone who's ever picked up a six string.The match-up between Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White is by no means an even one, nor is it meant to be. Page, with his legendary status as session man, Yardbird, and mystical guitarist of Led Zeppelin, comes across as the most enviable of the three. He's got the riffs, the money, the fame and the aura of infallibility. Even in his advancing years his English gentleman's demeanor is still suffused with a youthful spirit. So when Page launches into his signature phrase from ""Whole Lotta Love,"" you can see how incredibly simple the structure is -- and how only Page can pull it off with the right feeling. But the film's brilliance lies in the way it shifts from one musician to the next. The Edge and White are clearly checking out Page's moves even as they betray their admiration (the look on their faces says it all). But soon the focus is on the Edge's restless, chiming sound from ""Sunday Bloody Sunday,"" or ""Where the Streets Have No Name,"" and you remember that in an era younger than Page's, another set of hands was shaping the sound of emotion and lyricism. The film goes beyond a potentially dry rendition of ""let's jam together for the camera"" to explore the places these three musicians came from. I liked that fact that, for the most part, the reminiscences are vivid and short. There's just enough historical detail to make it interesting, and just enough music (both archival and performed for the film) to keep you riveted.As comparisons go, some may question why Jack White was included with the geniuses behind Led Zeppelin and U2. White's biographical sequences are contrivances (like his trek through rural Tennessee, speaking to his nine-year-old self in the back seat of a car) but they perhaps sum up what is both fantastical and challenging about becoming a guitar hero: the allure of playing to audiences, writing songs, and devoting oneself to music squared with the possibility of failure, hardship and a life of uncertainty and obscurity. Looking backwards at the success of these men, it's interesting to note where opportunity could have been missed: if Page had gone on with his session playing for another month, if the Edge hadn't met up with his future bandmates, if White hadn't heard his first blues song. So, whether one is a White Stripes fan or not, his contribution to the film must be seen as the work-in-progress, the young man with something to prove (and something to learn from the older guys). For all of White's private truculence, he clearly appreciates his time with the other men, and it's evident that all three share a love of the guitar.The look of the film is gorgeous in many ways. The opening credits promise a ballsy, no-nonsense look at rock and roll's glitter and cool. The instruments paraded and played will make amateurs smile. The ordinary places where things ""happened"" (Headley Grange, where Zeppelin recorded several albums; the lonely scenery of Dublin where the Edge rehearsed with a fledgling U2; the Detroit streets where Jack White pounded out his first tunes) are to fans of rock what the Pyramids and the deserts of Africa are to archaeologists. This is where it all began. (See also Abbey Road in London...)film, it's the truncated three-man jam of ""The Weight,"" the Band number that the guitarists feel their way through. The closing credits roll on early in the song, stealing some of the musical connection that was building. ""It Might Get Loud"" has no real discernible peaks -- it's not a concert film, or even a dramatic story -- but it does have a pace and a logic that makes sense given the three men who star in it. Viewers may engage in musical criticisms about who should have been included (Why not Clapton, or Gilmour, Townshend or either Beck? Why not Mark Knopfler versus Dickey Betts?) but that is part of the fun of it all, like baseball fantasy picks.

1286034,A2BJAET1P9QUGZ,B002RVZV9K,Baberufus,"[3, 12]","Judging from all the enthusiastically positive reviews of this film, I thought that there might be some kind of surprising chemistry or musical magic that occurred when these three very different guitarists got together--well, there wasn't much, as it turns out. The bio sketches of these three figures were interesting as separate clips, but the jam session/discussion was REALLY lame. It was just all too contrived. It was funny when Jack White was asked what was going to happen when the three guitarists got together and he answered ""Probably a fistfight."" Not likely, of course, but I expected a fistgight more than seeing the three guitarists sitting together and all three just plain ol' strumming the chords to ""The Weight."" Boring! Any one of them (or any novice guitarist, for that matter) could have handled that. What was the point? That song isn't in any of the three guitarists' reportoire, anyway. Couldn't they come up with some kind of jam that exemplified each of these three guitarists' individual styles? That happened to a slight extent on the ""In My Time of Dying"" jam, but overall the jams mostly just had them playing the same thing. And sorry, Edge just looked out of place playing a slide blues song, even if he did a fine job, of course.And do any of these guys really care about what strings the other guys use? I'm sure none of them could care less, and in fact I think Jack White said that he really couldn't care less about what strings HE uses!Yeah, this was just a goofy idea to have them sit around together and practically read a script for a discussion. The most fascinating parts of this video were the opening shot of Jack White making a miniature diddley bow, and the rare, very early footage of Page in his pre-Zeppelin days. Edge's soundcheck in the goofy ""living room"" was the most interesting part of the documentary in that setting (the ""discussion""), although it was just thrown in as an extra in the Special Features.Watching Jack White write and record a song was cool, I guess, but the resulting piece was pretty much a throwaway tune, as I'm sure he would agree. I mean, how inspired are you going to be to write a song when some film director requests it and sticks a camera in your face while you do it?This was a novel concept of filming this so-called ""informal"" dicussion, but it didn't generate anything interesting, IMO. Anything that is so contrived just isn't going to be natural, nor will it result in any real synergistic artistry.

1286036,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,B002RVZV9K,Bill R. Moore,"[28, 35]","For someone who has long loved guitars and classic rock, few documentary premises have intrigued me more than It Might Get Loud's - filming three generations of famous guitarists spontaneously chatting/jamming and interspersing their personal stories. Unfortunately, execution does not live up to promise. For starters, many may quibble with the guitarists - Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White -, but they essentially exemplify their generations and have a nice rapport. I would have of course loved to see other favorites included, and it would have been nice to see a pre-Page player, but the choices are hard to fault. The fact that they have very different styles is certainly a plus. I am a major, long-time Page fan and a minor Edge fan, so I was mostly excited on their part. They of course need no introduction; the mere fact that they are here makes it worth watching for fans. I had very little previous exposure to White, and what I knew - the most popular White Stripes singles - left me rather unimpressed. However, this gave me newfound respect for him. I still dislike his vocals and lyrics, but he truly deserves to be in the film not only because he is a noticeably talented guitarist but also because he has great knowledge of and respect for tradition. In addition, he is very humble and clearly grateful to be around the veterans, even if his reserve seems a bit studied and his traditionalism somewhat self-conscious. As for those who still doubt, it is after all very hard to think of another qualifying popular player from the 2000s.How much one likes the movie depends on expectations. I hoped the majority of it would be the guitarists talking and jamming, but this is far from true. Opening sequences create suspense about their meeting, with each wondering what will happen, but the meeting is a pathetic anticlimax; there is no excitement and hardly even a meeting scene at all. The interactions are undoubtedly absorbing, especially the players' interest in each other's work and the younger guitarists clearly being in awe of Page. However, the interaction is disappointingly low-key; there is almost no fire or magic. Many have mentioned the pivotal scene where The Edge and White watch Page play ""Whole Lotta Love"" like awe-stricken schoolboys, and the film is indeed almost worth watching for it alone, but it is the only such moment. The paucity of their playing together is particularly annoying; not even one full song is shown, and many are cut off far too early. These could have at least been given as extras, but that is sadly not the case. Segments of the individual players describing their techniques are more revealing, especially The Edge's.Viewers wanting other performance footage will also be disappointed, though this does not pretend to be a concert film. The archival footage will be familiar to fans but is generally used well, while footage of the individual musicians is among the highlights. Page fans will be especially thrilled to hear - and in one case see - the master play two new songs.The real problem is that, since only hard-cores will watch this, the documentary footage taking up such a large part of the film has little or nothing that viewers will not already know. I say this as a Page fan; the case may be otherwise for Edge/White fans, but I doubt it. Director Davis Guggenheim points out in an interview that it is interesting to see the guitarists tell their own story, but the lack of real insights is still highly detrimental. Even so, there are a few charming scenes, notably Page smiling like a star struck teenager and playing air guitar to Link Wray's ""Rumble.""Some miscellaneous points remain. The sound is strong throughout, which is of course key, and the cinematography is generally good, but many editing decisions are highly questionable. For example, a short perusal of deleted scenes - especially Page demonstrating ""Kashmir"" - shows that they are often better than much of what is used. Written or spoken narration would also have been very useful. Lack of a plot is inherent to the film and basically an asset - at least in theory -, but the way the movie jumps from one guitarist to the other without transitions or any real plan is sometimes confusing. Certain things that are unclear to non-hard-cores - e.g., the significance of the White Stripes playing in an old-fashioned hall to an audience of stuck-up, older men and The Edge's reference to a letter that led to U2's formation - would also have been cleared up.

Whether or not the Edge or Jack White is a great guitar player is a matter of opinion. One thing is obvious. These three have almost nothing in common and it shows. There's lots of biographical clips but no complete songs. The fact that Page isn't going to sing on any of his bits explains their brevity.

Page, of course, has by far the longest and most interesting bio of the three, while White, at age 34, is still evolving, and the Edge is concerned mainly with his many effects pedals and boxes to make his guitar sound like anything but. The three only jam a bit at the end on a Zep tune and one by The Band. That's when the movie is most interesting, although I really enjoyed one of the deleted scenes in which Page describes how he came up with the guitar riff on ""Kashmir,"" as the Edge looks on fascinated.

I may be wrong, but I watched this (on HBO, thankfully) thinking that it was about guitarists playing guitars.  Being one myself, the prospect seemed riveting, even if I'm not a fan of the Edge or knew much about Jack White.  I foolishly thought they would be sharing tricks of the trade, swapping  riffs, jamming, talking about effects, and all things guitar.There is some of this... but only a smattering and nothing developed.  We do get however, the early histories of each musico (!), as if endless documentaries on the matter don't already abound.  We see the Edge going back to his old school (twice!), commenting on the IRA (how relevant is that?!), White recounts childhood stories in a Mexican neighborhood (yawn), and some more than familiar Page memories.  Then, there is much footage on each musician on his own  working at home, the studio(although hardly any on Page), and even in concert (old Zep reels).And the guys sitting around jamming???  Precious little.You see, I thought they would be together in a room playing away, LIKE THE TRAILER SHOWED.  This is but a fraction of the movie.  Do not get your hopes up.  The only ONE real jam is on Page's ""In My Time Of Dying"", and then the movie briefly worked for me.  (They do get together at the very end to sing The Band's ""The Weight"", but it's pretty forgettable.)My last quibble.  Jack White was virtually unknown to me & may remain so:  he is unimpressive as a guitarist and especially as a songwriter.  He seems more intent on trying to shed some cred on himself most of the time.  The Edge fared better though what he reveals barely scratched the surface on technique, style, habits, etc.  Page has the riffs so his contributions were interesting yet negligible, and again hardly anything on his playing.I watched this for the interaction among the three and the playing insights.

1286044,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B002RVZV9K,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[4, 5]","We are entering an era, I feel, in which some names in the arts will remain constant in history, while some will slowly fade out - even if their music has, perhaps, the same quality. That is what I felt when I watched ""It Might Get Loud,"" an illuminating and penetrating documentary about three guitarists of importance in present times: Jimmy Page, David ""The Edge"" Howell Evans, and John Anthony Gillis (aka Jack White).Although the film begins by telling us that ""on January 23, 2008, three musicians came together to discuss the electric guitar,"" we are in for much, much more. The guitarists do get together, but in between the takes of the meeting, we are shown historical footage of their careers. It is also a get-together of three generations of masters of the electric guitar, if you will: Page was born in 1944, The Edge on 1961, and White in 1975. White is the only one born in the United States (Detroit), while Page and The Edge were born in areas adjacent to London. White, being the youngest of the trio, says, before the meeting, that he wanted to ""trick them into teaching me all their tricks."" Whether or not he succeeded, will go with him to the grave.For my taste, I mostly enjoyed the scenes of the film in which the guitarists are shown in their own environments, before they got together. They discuss, almost in detail, their musical influences, and we see some footage and hear some of the music of the artists that influenced them. This is pure gold, I think. We see them playing some chords of some of the recordings that they admire, and they talk about their guitars, including their very first one. We follow them throughout their evolution as musicians, when, for example, Page was a member of Mickey Finn and the Blue Men, Carter Lewis and the Southerners, the Yardbirds, and, of course, Led Zeppelin. We see White performing with his sister (at the drums), the Raconteurs, and the White Stripes. We also enjoy them performing in concerts, including U2's ""Where the Street Have No Name."" When they get together, they play parts of their songs, like ""I will follow,"" ""Whole Lotta Love,"" and ""Dead leaves and the Dirty Ground."" Interestingly, they perform these tunes with their electric guitars. At the end, however, they sit down at a different location inside the soundstage, and play with acoustic guitars.""It Might get Loud"" is an important document of our times, and, as I said at the beginning, I got a felling that one of the guitarist portrayed in this film will be remembered forever, one may survive the test of time, and one will probably be almost forgotten. When they play together, you can feel the nervousness and some degree of discomfort - maybe because there are too many people around, as well as cameras. However, they do synchronize their efforts the best possible way, given the fact that they have probably never been together before. It's all for history. By the way, it was The Edge, who at one point in the film, while practicing at an undisclosed location, says, ""It Might get loud for a second,"" which probably got the film its title. The DVD also includes deleted scenes; commentary by director Davis Guggenheim, and producers Lesley Chilcott and Thomas Tull, and more.

He was dogged about finding their inspirations and their stories from the earliest days.  He unearthed little known facts, which might strike one as trivia at first, but then you realize that without those idiosyncratic tics, they might not be the people they are today.For example, Page went to art school in addition to everything else he's done.  He just couldn't live if he didn't try painting, drawing, graphic design, etc., in addition to everything else he was doing in music. White grew up in a lower class section of Detroit, where he was one of the few whites, in a family of ten kids.  Very few people wanted to play musical instruments in that area.  They all wanted to perform rap.  Yet he had so much musical equipment in his very small bedroom that he had to sleep on a foam rubber mat at an angle on the floor.  The Edge is the only politically motivated one but he is in such a band, U2, with the kids he met in grade school.  He takes us back to his school.The above is just a very small sampling of what the director manages to unearth about these three musicians.  I found it utterly fascinating. One other thing the director did is drop entirely the personal lives of these three as far as wives, ex-wives, girlfriends, children, etc.,  For all we know by the end, all three are single and childless. (I know this isn't true but from other sources.)

I wasn't familiar with Jack White's music nor was I a huge fan of the Edge but as a devoted Zeppelin fan I was in it just to see the insights that Page would offer to the conversation.  Like another reviewer said, I was hooked, I didn't want to leave nor did I want them to leave.  I sat around and watched all the extras in the first sitting just trying to get them to stay around a little longer.  I brought the movie in to school and we watched it as a part of class. Even non-guitar players in the group really liked the movie more for the insights into the musical beginnings that each player offered.  The stories that the Edge told were an almost exact re-telling of the kids in our Rock Band, what a way to inspire new musicians!The closet-groupie in me was psyched to get a glimpse at Jimmy's music rooms and a glimpse into his everyday life.  It really drew in the viewer in a way that no Zeppelin film ever could.  The early footage of the group recording at Headley Grange and of Jimmy in his session days was worth the price of admission.Some complain about the selection of guitarists for this film. After watching it for the 3rd time I can understand why the 3 were chosen.  They weren't necessarily chosen for their technical skill but for what they've done for the guitar in their respective time periods.  Page was one of the innovators of rock guitar in the 60s and 70s, Edge was an innovator in his use of effects and creating that shimmering 80s sound.  Jack White just doesn't have much competition these days, sure plenty of folks are still playing guitar but many are emulating SRV or the sounds of Page, Beck, Clapton or Hendrix.  He'll get the younger generation involved and he's developing his own sound, just as the others had.With all that said, I felt like there was a lot more I would have liked to have heard them talk about.  Some questions that us guitar players (who don't have our own guitar techs) would have liked to have heard the answers to as far as tone, amps, pickups, etc.  I'm sure these things weren't touched upon as much because the folks doing the talking already have that sort of thing figured out.  Maybe a sequel?  Just let me know, I've got plenty of topics for discussion in mind  ;-)All in all a great movie and well worth a place in your library whether you're a guitarist, fan or someone looking to make it in the world of rock.",5,Can't believe it took this long...,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,2508,"[""'m"", 'music', 'teacher', 'public', 'school', 'have', 'Rock', 'Band', 'class', 'found', 'out', 'movie', 'one', 'students', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'Jack', 'White', 'music', 'was', 'huge', 'fan', 'Edge', 'devoted', 'Zeppelin', 'fan', 'was', 'just', 'see', 'insights', 'Page', 'would', 'offer', 'conversation', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'hooked', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'leave', 'did', 'want', 'leave', 'sat', 'watched', 'extras', 'first', 'sitting', 'just', 'trying', 'get', 'stay', 'little', 'longer', 'brought', 'movie', 'school', 'watched', 'part', 'class', 'Even', 'non-guitar', 'players', 'group', 'really', 'liked', 'movie', 'more', 'insights', 'musical', 'beginnings', 'player', 'offered', 'stories', 'Edge', 'told', 'were', 'almost', 'exact', 're-telling', 'kids', 'Rock', 'Band', 'what', 'way', 'inspire', 'new', 'musicians', 'closet-groupie', 'was', 'psyched', 'get', 'glimpse', 'Jimmy', 'music', 'rooms', 'glimpse', 'everyday', 'life', 'really', 'drew', 'viewer', 'way', 'Zeppelin', 'film', 'ever', 'could', 'early', 'footage', 'group', 'recording', 'Headley', 'Grange', 'Jimmy', 'session', 'days', 'was', 'worth', 'price', 'admission.Some', 'complain', 'selection', 'guitarists', 'film', 'watching', '3rd', 'time', 'can', 'understand', 'why', '3', 'were', 'chosen', 'were', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'chosen', 'technical', 'skill', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'guitar', 'respective', 'time', 'periods', 'Page', 'was', 'one', 'innovators', 'rock', 'guitar', '60s', '70s', 'Edge', 'was', 'innovator', 'use', 'effects', 'creating', 'shimmering', '80s', 'sound', 'Jack', 'White', 'just', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'competition', 'days', 'sure', 'plenty', 'folks', 'are', 'still', 'playing', 'guitar', 'many', 'are', 'emulating', 'SRV', 'sounds', 'Page', 'Beck', 'Clapton', 'Hendrix', ""'ll"", 'get', 'younger', 'generation', 'involved', 'developing', 'own', 'sound', 'just', 'others', 'had.With', 'said', 'felt', 'was', 'lot', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'talk', 'questions', 'guitar', 'players', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'own', 'guitar', 'techs', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'heard', 'answers', 'as', 'far', 'tone', 'amps', 'pickups', 'etc', ""'m"", 'sure', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'touched', 'as', 'much', 'folks', 'doing', 'talking', 'already', 'have', 'sort', 'thing', 'figured', 'out', 'Maybe', 'sequel', 'Just', 'let', 'know', ""'ve"", 'got', 'plenty', 'topics', 'discussion', 'mind', 'great', 'movie', 'well', 'place', 'library', ""'re"", 'guitarist', 'fan', 'someone', 'looking', 'make', 'world', 'rock']",N/A
1286047,A1A89LQ8C1AYV1,B002RVZV9K,Christopher Deweese,"[1, 1]","It Might Get Loud is an interesting mish mash of three different generations of guitarists and what inspired them.  Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin), The Edge (U2), and Jack White (The White Stripes, The Raconteurs) take you on a trip down memory lane and explain their approach to guitar playing, along with some interesting stories of what influenced them as kids.  It's a good documentary as a whole, but there are times when it seems a bit self-indulgent.I guess the main point of the documentary is how guitar playing has evolved over the decades and how it's still relevant today.  It would seem that Jimmy represented the 60's and 70's, while The Edge represented the 80's and 90's.  I assume Jack White represented the 00's and whatever is to come.  What is very clear is the passion these three men have for the art form.  Through archival footage and interviews we get to see these guys in ways most probably haven't seen before.  I was intrigued by some of the old TV footage of Jimmy Page when he was in his early teens.  It was really interesting watching these three guys jam together and sort of get off on each others riffs.  I particularly enjoyed the trio's rendition of ""The Weight.""There are times, however, when the film feels a bit disjointed.  The structure of the film is rather arbitrary, jumping from one guitarist's story to another's and then back again.  Most of the film is these guys just talking about what they like.  They do play occasionally, but I found that those segments were cut too short.  Some of the archival footage is of them playing live, and just when they get really rockin' they cut to more interviews.  What a bunch of teases.Self-indulgence aside, if you like documentaries about music you will likely find something to enjoy in It Might Get Loud.

It was satisfying to see the verbal interplay between them, as well as snippets of them informally jamming together.  Clearly, out of the 3, the world class 'guitar god' Jimmy Page deserved to be there the most.  He is, by far, the most innovative, progressive, and revered of the 3.  The Edge is a good player too, as he was in one of the bands that help propel the 'new wave' (as it was called then), or 'alternative' movement with his interesting playing.  And although I liked Jack White the personality, I couldn't help asking myself just what in God's name is Jack White doing up there with such accomplished veterans like Page and The Edge?!  In my opinion, as a guitarist, he is nothing special.  In fact, I find his playing extremely boring.  Even if you're into throwback blues and pared down playing, there are many who surpass him by far (Rory Gallagher, Roy Buchanan, Stevie Ray Vaughn, Robert Cray, etc.).  But of course, I realize the producers had to find some one in that realm who is not deceased, and fairly popular with the current generation.",4,Great to see Jimmy and The Edge... but JACK WHITE?!?!?,1265932800,"02 12, 2010",2010,1204,"['Overall', 'was', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'electric', 'guitar', 'interpretations', 'discussions', 'least', '2', 'well', 'known', 'musicians', 'was', 'satisfying', 'see', 'verbal', 'interplay', 'as', 'well', 'snippets', 'informally', 'jamming', 'together', 'Clearly', '3', 'world', 'class', 'god', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'deserved', 'be', 'there', 'most', 'far', 'most', 'innovative', 'progressive', 'revered', '3', 'Edge', 'good', 'player', 'too', 'was', 'one', 'bands', 'help', 'propel', ""'new"", 'wave', 'was', 'called', 'then', 'movement', 'interesting', 'playing', 'liked', 'Jack', 'White', 'personality', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'asking', 'just', 'what', 'God', 'name', 'Jack', 'White', 'doing', 'up', 'there', 'such', 'accomplished', 'veterans', 'Page', 'Edge', 'opinion', 'guitarist', 'nothing', 'special', 'fact', 'find', 'playing', 'extremely', 'boring', 'Even', ""'re"", 'throwback', 'blues', 'pared', 'down', 'playing', 'are', 'many', 'who', 'surpass', 'far', 'Rory', 'Gallagher', 'Roy', 'Buchanan', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughn', 'Robert', 'Cray', 'etc.', 'course', 'realize', 'producers', 'had', 'find', 'one', 'realm', 'who', 'not', 'deceased', 'fairly', 'popular', 'current', 'generation']",N/A

Lebryk,"[15, 16]","Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin, The Yardbirds, and solo career), The Edge (U2), and Jack White (The White Stripes and Raconteurs) get together to talk and play guitar. Does anyone that loves guitar need to know more? These three guitarists are from totally different schools of playing - Page is all about the sound and which guitar he plays; The Edge is all about the technology and sound effects; and White is all about playing with anything that he can get his hands on (he says, I have this guitar with a bent neck and I work to make great sound with it). They are three different generations of guitar players. To have these three play together and make gorgeous music is incredible. The three styles end up working together beautifully.December 26, 2010 update: I purchased the Blu-Ray disc, what a huge disappointment compared to the DVD. The sound wasn't over the top incredible a million times better than the DVD. The image is not that much better either. Granted the style of this film, high definition isn't necessarily important (after all, do you really need to see every wrinkle on Jimmy Page or The Edge and Jack White's sweat). Honestly, save your money and buy the DVD, it is equally fine. One caveat with my recommendation, I do have an upconverting receiver that takes DVD's to 1080i, and sound is run optically into a fine receiver for decoding there. It is possible I've eeked out every shred of quality possible in the DVD, and the Blu-Ray (PS3) just doesn't do that much better in this case.The DVD is gorgeous. The sound is incredible. The film style does not get in the way of these three artists. It would be easy to pick on some of the film techniques, but I just couldn't stop pinching myself over the sound these three made. I found myself watching Jimmy Page play and just pinching myself, he is a master. I'm sure that Jack White felt the same way.I triple loved this film. I grew up with Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin, and The Yardbirds. I'm not a fan of U2 at all, but listening to The Edge play, I appreciated what he does, by far the best part of U2. Jack White has something very special going on with his music, solid blues roots (I love the blues). Layer this over the fact that my youngest son has begun playing the guitar. We spent a lot of time pausing to look at those special guitars in this film. I have a whole special appreciation for guitar players.The watching - if you have a good surround sound system, this film will make it shine. The dynamic range is huge in this film. Some of the dialog is almost impossible to hear, but the music is always spot on loud and very well recorded. After all, this film is all about guitar playing, not much else.The DVD is chock full of bonus features. This is one to spend a long time studying.The film is rated PG. I think there might be one tiny swear word somewhere in here. How in the world the director managed to get these three to talk about music and maintain a PG rating is beyond me. All for the better, anyone that is studying guitar should watch this excellent movie.If you aren't a big fan of any of these three, this will be a painful movie. There isn't much story here. Visually it's done just fine, but it's not really a movie with three acts. If you are a fan of rock music or the guitar, this is a fabulous film. I was riveted for every minute.

1286052,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B002RVZV9K,Danno,"[0, 0]","If you're a rock guitarist, you're going to get a lot out of this movie. This is a low-key summit of sorts in which three very different guitarists (Jimmy Page, the Edge, and Jack White)kick back to trade licks and talk about why the love playing electric guitar so much. In separate segments, we also learn about many of the obstacles each man has faced in becoming a truly unique and memorable instrumentalist. For Page - the most musicianly of the lot - it seems to have been the fear of being a session player for the rest of his life. White, on the other hand, feared that his passion for the blues would lock him into a predictable 12 bar ""blues-rock"" box. The Edge's story is most dramatic, taking us back to the Ireland of the 1970s which was wracked by an awful economy and hideous acts of terrorism. It's an absolute treasure seeing each of their unique approaches and contrasting them; the Edge revels in high-tech pedals and rack effects whereas White prefers cheaper guitars and amps that he has to ""fight"" to get a sound out of.If you're not a rock guitarist, you will probably deduct a star from my interview and wish there were more ""fight"" in this movie. There's absolutely no conflict on display here, and all three guitar heroes are true gentlemen even when they politely disagree. The very best rock movies (such as ""Hail, Hail Rock and Roll"" and even the comedy ""This is Spinal Tap"") are able to attract nonmusicians through very dramatic scenes with conflict. I saw this film with a nonmusician who found the film long-winded and tedious when the guitarists weren't playing, and I can understand why.Still, to me, the true beauty of the film is how it forces the viewer to re-evaluate guitarists who they may not personally enjoy. There are those who have claimed Page is a dinosaur who couldn't play well on stage, that the Edge is a player of effects rather than of music, and that White is a barely competent eccentric. I believe this movie proves those people wrong, and it reveals the professional craft behind even what sounds like off-the-cuff playing.

1286054,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002RVZV9K,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[10, 12]","In 2009, the documentary ""It Might Get Loud"" directed by David Guggenheim (""Gossip"", ""An Inconvenient Truth"") made its way through the various film festivals.The documentary was created to highlight the electric guitar, so what best than to feature three iconic electric guitar musicians: Jimmy Page (The Yard Birds, Led Zeppelin), The Edge (""U2') and Jack White (White Stripes, The Raconteurs).  Each men with different musical backgrounds and from different countries and get to know how they became passionate for the electric guitar, learning of their musical inspirations, revisiting areas where they first became involved in their bands, footage of them performing live (with vintage footage) and their approach to music, what goes behind-the-scenes when they are writing songs and much more.The documentary captures these musicians up-close and personal but also what happens when you bring these three musicians together with their instruments and what kind of music they come up with together.VIDEO & AUDIO:""It Might Get Loud"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The picture quality is fantastic.  The documentary was shot in HD and aside from the vintage footage and old photos, the modern footage was shot entirely in HD and the amount of detail is just wonderful.  You literally see the detail in some of the vintage instruments.  For example, in one scene, Jack White performs a song on the piano and you can see the rugged look of the old piano.  Especially later on as he performs on an older guitar.You do see quite a bit of grain on some of the stock footage and of course, older vintage footage is not exactly going to be the best looking on Blu-ray but for the most part, picture quality is quite solid for the modern sequences of this documentary.  Skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep.  Some modern scenes has its share of low light noise and I did notice certain scenes with occasional dust but for the most part, picture quality is solid!Audio quality is presented in English, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1.  Lossless audio is fantastic!  From when you first hear Jack White messing around with a guitar, that the electric guitar comes out quite clear through the front channels.  But when you start hearing Jimmy Page and The Edge play and the followed by Jack White and the various bands, you can't help but be impressed about the clarity of the instruments.I can't tell you that by watching these guys play, especially when Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White just sat together and then started jamming, you can't help but get goose bumps.  Absolutely fantastic!  Especially the final improvisation scene with all three men just jamming.  Just brilliant!  There was no rehearsal, these three guys just start jamming in unison.  Awesome!Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic.SPECIAL FEATURES:""It Might Get Loud"" comes with the following special features featured in Standard and High Definition.  English Stereo and subtitles in Portuguese in Spanish and French.  Included are:* Audio Commentary -- Audio commentary by Director Davis Guggenheim, Producer Lesley Chilcott and Producer Thomas Tull.  An informative commentary with good insight on what happened behind-the-scenes and what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish.* Toronto Film Festival Press Conference --(38:26) Q&A; footage from the Toronto Film Festival Press Conference featuring Director Davis Guggenheim, Producer Thomas Tull and Lesley Chilcott and the three musicians: Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White.* Deleted Scenes--(26:06) Featuring the following eleven deleted scenes:  Jimmy Page plays Acoustic, Four Sticks on Acoustic, Kashmir, Strings, Theremin, Nicknames, The Edge plays ""Stairway to Heaven"", The Edge's Sound Check, I Fought Army's, Seven Nation Army, Deleted Animation.* Theatrical Trailer - (2:26) Original theatrical trailer for ""It Might Get Loud"".JUDGMENT CALL:An incredible and amazing documentary.For anyone who enjoys rock n' roll especially these talented guitarists such as legend Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White will love this film.  I was pretty amazed about how enjoyable this documentary turned out to be.  Learning about their passion for the electric guitar, playing music, learning about their past and also footage of their bands (vintage footage of Led Zeppelin and U2) was pretty awesome.But what really made things much more enjoyable was watching ""It Might Get Loud"" on Blu-ray.  The film was shot in HD and the detail was just amazing.  From the old vintage instruments, you literally see the age on them and the various locations where the documentary were shot looks quite impressive.  The lossless audio was fantastic and to hear the three perform and hear the guitar so crystal clear and so well-defined through your home theater is quite amazing.This documentary goes beyond just enjoying the music and historic information from Page, The Edge and White, you also get to see other classic footage of artists and bands that these musicians enjoyed.  Seeing 1930's Blues artists to punk bands such as The Clash and the Ramones was pretty awesome.  But there are some deep thoughts from the musicians that you can't help but listen.  This is probably one of the most personal rock documentaries as we see the thought process behind the music, their first instruments, the challenges they faced earlier in their career or at a young age and more.I know there are some people who wish there was more music and less talk but personally, I was amazed by hearing their stories.  Yes, I enjoy listening to their music but to tell you the truth, aside from listening to their music, I never knew the personal side to these men.  Director Guggenheim let these men do their thing and I know some wish there was more prodding by the director but this was a different type of documentary that Guggenheim wanted to accomplish and so, it's less about ego's or personal clashes, it's all about the love of music.  So, I found this documentary to be quite fascinating and just highly entertaining.Also, the special features were just enjoyable to watch.  The fact that these three musicians allowed the filmmakers to get up close and capture the personal side of them was quite amazing and when all is done, the special features showcase some enjoyable scenes as Jimmy Page plays the guitar and The Edge and Jack White are just in awe by the legend.  You can tell that these musicians savored the moment, especially when the three start jamming with Jimmy Page while he plays ""Kashmir"".Overall, if you are a rock musician or a fan of any of these talents or the bands they are part of, ""It Might Get Loud"" is a magnificent documentary worth owning on Blu-ray.""It Might Get Loud"" on Blu-ray definitely receives my highest recommendation!",5,Blu-ray:  Fantastic!!!

1286058,A10562CQXZ5ORC,B002RVZV9K,"D. Tubbs ""Les Paul Player""","[3, 3]","I enjoyed this video mostly because Jimmy Page was featured. When I first heard about this production and of what guitarists it featured, I didn't understand how either The Edge or Jack White could stand on a stage next to Jimmy. I wish Paul Gilbert, Jake E. Lee, Doug Aldrich, Gary Moore, Audley Freed, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, David Gilmour, Eric Johnson, Eddie Van Halen (if he could stay clean) or any number of other true guitarists for the guitarist community could have been featured rather than Edge or Jack. Don't get me wrong; I like U2's music and appreciate the unique quality of The Edge's style but his playing could never be considered in the same league as that of Pagey. For the most part, I enjoyed Edge's parts in this film, particularly his modesty in afirming that his array of effects has much to do with his sound. Seeing he and Mr. White react to Jimmy whipping out a couple of timeless Zeppelin riffs was very cool and I appreciate the subtle respect paid to JP by both of these professional musicians. I appreciated Jack White as an artist a great deal more after seeing this film. Anyone in today's creative vacuum who has the guts to revisit late 60s to 70s blues guitar style gets at least some of my attention. It's pretty hard to come up with new creative techniques on guitar today but this film features a couple of Jack's creative 'inventions' that really impressed me. Quotes by all three musicians are thoughtful and encouraged me as a guitarist to enjoy the music creating experience for what it is at the moment and for what it does for it's creators emotionally. Led Zep received a great deal of criticism, especially with the first 4 albums and this was revisited. During different segments, the 3 play each other's music together and seem to have a good time with it. Each tells what his influences were when they were young and much of it was surprizing to me. If you are a fan of late 60's, 70s or 80s rock, any blues based rock or of the bands represented by any of these guitarists, you'll want to own this disk. I rented it first only because it appeared at the rental store when I had a free rental coming to me. Even after watching it twice, I had to buy it to keep in my library. I thank each of these musicians and those like them who enrich our lives with the sharing of thier talent and compositional talent.",5,Always cool to see Jimmy,1269129600,"03 21, 2010",2010,2357,"['enjoyed', 'video', 'mostly', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'was', 'featured', 'When', 'first', 'heard', 'production', 'what', 'featured', 'did', ""n't"", 'understand', 'how', 'Edge', 'Jack', 'White', 'could', 'stand', 'stage', 'next', 'Jimmy', 'wish', 'Paul', 'Gilbert', 'Jake', 'E.', 'Lee', 'Doug', 'Aldrich', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'Audley', 'Freed', 'Kenny', 'Wayne', 'Shepherd', 'David', 'Gilmour', 'Eric', 'Johnson', 'Eddie', 'Van', 'Halen', 'could', 'stay', 'clean', 'number', 'other', 'true', 'guitarists', 'guitarist', 'community', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'featured', 'rather', 'Edge', 'Jack', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'U2', 'music', 'appreciate', 'unique', 'quality', 'Edge', 'style', 'playing', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'considered', 'same', 'league', 'Pagey', 'most', 'part', 'enjoyed', 'Edge', 'parts', 'film', 'particularly', 'modesty', 'afirming', 'array', 'effects', 'much', 'do', 'sound', 'Seeing', 'Mr.', 'White', 'react', 'Jimmy', 'whipping', 'out', 'couple', 'timeless', 'Zeppelin', 'riffs', 'was', 'very', 'cool', 'appreciate', 'subtle', 'respect', 'paid', 'JP', 'professional', 'musicians', 'appreciated', 'Jack', 'White', 'artist', 'great', 'deal', 'more', 'seeing', 'film', 'Anyone', 'today', 'creative', 'vacuum', 'who', 'guts', 'revisit', 'late', '60s', '70s', 'blues', 'guitar', 'style', 'least', 'attention', 'pretty', 'hard', 'come', 'up', 'new', 'creative', 'techniques', 'guitar', 'today', 'film', 'couple', 'Jack', 'creative', ""'inventions"", 'really', 'impressed', 'Quotes', 'three', 'musicians', 'are', 'thoughtful', 'encouraged', 'guitarist', 'enjoy', 'music', 'creating', 'experience', 'what', 'moment', 'what', 'creators', 'emotionally', 'Led', 'Zep', 'received', 'great', 'deal', 'criticism', 'especially', 'first', '4', 'albums', 'was', 'revisited', 'different', 'segments', '3', 'play', 'other', 'music', 'together', 'seem', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'what', 'influences', 'were', 'when', 'were', 'young', 'much', 'was', 'surprizing', 'are', 'fan', 'late', '60', '70s', '80s', 'rock', 'blues', 'based', 'rock', 'bands', 'represented', 'guitarists', ""'ll"", 'want', 'own', 'disk', 'rented', 'first', 'only', 'appeared', 'rental', 'store', 'when', 'had', 'free', 'rental', 'coming', 'Even', 'watching', 'twice', 'had', 'buy', 'keep', 'library', 'thank', 'musicians', 'who', 'enrich', 'lives', 'sharing', 'thier', 'talent', 'compositional', 'talent']",N/A
1286059,A3D3DJKKMLCRYZ,B002RVZV9K,"Erin ""skyblueboy""","[6, 10]","This movie can serve as an inspiration, but it also shows the insecurities of musicians. It will come as no surprise that musicians are insecure, but there's also a lot of close mindedness that goes with that. Jack White is the biggest culprit of the three gathered here, with the Edge expressing his share of it. It might surprise some that Jimmy Page, the oldest of them, comes across as the most open.Jack White is guilty of what a lot of people are; drawing simple conclusions about complex issues and being unable to see how he contradicts his beliefs through his actions. Jack condemns technology, stating that the ease of use it brings inhibits creativity and inspiration.Why then, Jack, do you drive a car or use a plane, instead of walking? Why live in a house instead of a cave? Why use an electric guitar, or an acoustic one, or even use your voice instead of banging on rocks in order to convey your music? Hell, maybe the rocks themselves would just make things too easy?This thinking could be directed at the Edge, who often uses technology as an extension of his musical expression. He and the Edge make comments about the rock acts of the 70s, who performed drawn out guitar and drum solos, calling them pretentious. They do this all while ignoring the fact that their Idol, Jimmy Page, was involved in one of the bands that did this.More importantly, they fail to see their own pretense, Jack, in trying to be a Black Blues Singer and the Edge in the pretentious minimalism of punk. Also, U2's live show could be accused of the same pretentious spectacle that the bands of the 70s used.There are statements that Blues musicians were rebels, because they bucked the trend of happy, pop music. But why are the bands who did the 15 minute songs not looked at as rebels for bucking the trend of shorter, simpler songs? And why don't they realize that, while the initial Blues musicians may have bucked a trend, anyone else involved in it were part of a trend they created? This applies to the Punk Music that U2 followed and the retro rock that Jack became a part of.I wish the documentary explored this more. If Jack White truly believes there should be some conflict, then this would have been an opportunity for the directors or somebody to pose tough questions to him about his perceptions, or even to the Edge about why the Punk movement felt it needed and still needs to criticize bands like Led Zeppelin, even though they were clearly inspired by them.There seems to be some evidence that they realize their assumptions are a bit close minded in the Q & A session conducted after the film was cut, but I still think it could have been taken further.Don't misunderstand, I'm a fan of these guys. But being a fan doesn't mean blindly accepting everything they say. I think this documentary could have been more of a learning experience for the musicians involved and the people watching it, if they had probed a little deeper.It is nice to see them come together in more ways than one though. It's also nice to see that no matter how old you get, you can still have that kid in your who freaks out when you meet or hear someone who inspired you. A big plus is getting to watch each musician do their solo work, to get a glimpse into their thinking and how a song comes to them.It also should give some comfort to all those musicians who get frustrated when they're having a hard time hearing how a song is played, to know that musicians who have been playing for 20 to almost 50 years, still have to ask which key or note is being played and have to watch each other's fingers to know how to play relatively easy songs.This documentary works on the things it shows, but fails to be better on those it doesn't. If you take it for what it offers, it's pretty decent. I just feel a little more digging would have given it some true insight.",3,It Might Be Better,1311552000,"07 25, 2011",2011,3855,"['movie', 'can', 'serve', 'inspiration', 'also', 'insecurities', 'musicians', 'will', 'come', 'surprise', 'musicians', 'are', 'insecure', 'also', 'lot', 'close', 'mindedness', 'Jack', 'White', 'biggest', 'culprit', 'three', 'gathered', 'here', 'Edge', 'expressing', 'share', 'might', 'surprise', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'oldest', 'most', 'open.Jack', 'White', 'guilty', 'what', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'drawing', 'simple', 'conclusions', 'complex', 'issues', 'being', 'unable', 'see', 'how', 'beliefs', 'actions', 'Jack', 'condemns', 'technology', 'stating', 'ease', 'use', 'inhibits', 'creativity', 'inspiration.Why', 'then', 'Jack', 'do', 'drive', 'car', 'use', 'plane', 'instead', 'walking', 'Why', 'live', 'house', 'instead', 'cave', 'Why', 'use', 'electric', 'guitar', 'acoustic', 'one', 'even', 'use', 'voice', 'instead', 'banging', 'rocks', 'order', 'convey', 'music', 'Hell', 'maybe', 'rocks', 'would', 'just', 'make', 'things', 'too', 'easy', 'thinking', 'could', 'be', 'directed', 'Edge', 'who', 'often', 'technology', 'extension', 'musical', 'expression', 'Edge', 'make', 'comments', 'rock', 'acts', '70s', 'who', 'performed', 'drawn', 'out', 'guitar', 'drum', 'solos', 'calling', 'pretentious', 'do', 'ignoring', 'fact', 'Idol', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'was', 'involved', 'one', 'bands', 'did', 'this.More', 'importantly', 'fail', 'see', 'own', 'pretense', 'Jack', 'trying', 'be', 'Black', 'Blues', 'Singer', 'Edge', 'pretentious', 'minimalism', 'punk', 'Also', 'U2', 'live', 'show', 'could', 'be', 'accused', 'same', 'pretentious', 'spectacle', 'bands', '70s', 'are', 'statements', 'Blues', 'musicians', 'were', 'rebels', 'bucked', 'trend', 'happy', 'pop', 'music', 'why', 'are', 'bands', 'who', 'did', '15', 'minute', 'songs', 'not', 'looked', 'rebels', 'bucking', 'trend', 'shorter', 'simpler', 'songs', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'initial', 'Blues', 'musicians', 'may', 'have', 'bucked', 'trend', 'anyone', 'else', 'involved', 'were', 'part', 'trend', 'created', 'Punk', 'Music', 'U2', 'followed', 'retro', 'rock', 'Jack', 'became', 'part', 'wish', 'documentary', 'explored', 'more', 'Jack', 'White', 'truly', 'should', 'be', 'conflict', 'then', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'opportunity', 'directors', 'somebody', 'pose', 'tough', 'questions', 'perceptions', 'even', 'Edge', 'why', 'Punk', 'movement', 'felt', 'needed', 'still', 'criticize', 'bands', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'even', 'were', 'clearly', 'inspired', 'them.There', 'be', 'evidence', 'realize', 'assumptions', 'are', 'bit', 'close', 'minded', 'Q', 'A', 'session', 'conducted', 'film', 'was', 'cut', 'still', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'further.Do', ""n't"", 'misunderstand', ""'m"", 'fan', 'guys', 'being', 'fan', ""n't"", 'mean', 'blindly', 'accepting', 'everything', 'say', 'think', 'documentary', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'learning', 'experience', 'musicians', 'involved', 'people', 'watching', 'had', 'probed', 'little', 'deeper.It', 'nice', 'see', 'come', 'together', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'though', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'matter', 'how', 'old', 'get', 'can', 'still', 'have', 'kid', 'who', 'freaks', 'out', 'when', 'meet', 'hear', 'someone', 'who', 'inspired', 'big', 'plus', 'getting', 'watch', 'musician', 'do', 'solo', 'work', 'get', 'glimpse', 'thinking', 'how', 'song', 'them.It', 'also', 'should', 'give', 'comfort', 'musicians', 'who', 'get', 'frustrated', 'when', ""'re"", 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'hearing', 'how', 'song', 'played', 'know', 'musicians', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'playing', '20', 'almost', '50', 'years', 'still', 'have', 'ask', 'key', 'note', 'being', 'played', 'have', 'watch', 'other', 'fingers', 'know', 'how', 'play', 'relatively', 'easy', 'songs.This', 'documentary', 'works', 'things', 'be', 'better', ""n't"", 'take', 'what', 'pretty', 'decent', 'just', 'feel', 'little', 'more', 'digging', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'true', 'insight']",N/A

1286061,A2WHP314I6KDIP,B002RVZV9K,"G. Jordan ""Voracious Reader""","[0, 3]","I had not heard Jack White, except briefly in Glastonbury Festival DVD as White Stripes with his sister Meg on drums. I knew Page of course & everyone knows Bono. I believe the previews were exactly what was delivered, and then some. I loved the behind-the-scenes footage, especially showing White building a guitar on a piece of wood using ONE wire and a coke bottle to play it, while a cow lazily chews its cud next to him in a rural field in England! I could immediately tell that not only had White done his homework by studying from the masters of blues, he had talent the likes of which we rarely see (eg. Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmy Hendrix). The video does seem to focus more on White & Page second, very little of Bono before the jam session.What's interesting is that as Page was playing guitar, he made the exact same facial expressions he did over 30 years ago in Song Remains the Same live performance, I watched both the same week, and noticed he hasn't changed how much he LOVES playing guitar, or his passion about music. The 3 men meet on a built-up stage similar to a wresting ring without the rope, up off the main floor. Each has his little setup, equipment, effects hardware & guitars, amps, etc. At 1st they all stay in their own little areas, but as they start to play, one by one, they each get excited about what the other can do, wanting to learn from each other, as in ""I always wondered how you did that"". Bono is the most humble it seems, as he keeps telling us if it weren't for his effects pedals, he'd be playing a repeated boring bass guitar sound--anything BUT boring, either way. We get to see how Bono makes the sounds & the fact that he plays differently EVERY time. Of course, both younger axe men get the most excited when Page plays, truly in awe and wanting to learn some tricks of the trade--in fact all 3 share numerous tips & secrets, with each other, & us vicariously.For those who love jam sessions, when anything can & does happen musically, when 3 of the greatest guitarists get together, it's music heaven. The viewer feels as if present with them, just as excited as they are to play, and as we are to hear the original music these three make TOGETHER, jamming & truly loving what they are doing, which shows through all they do on this film.There was NO script, that's why the lead up was suspenseful, because no one knew what to expect, throwing 3 greats in a room on a stage together with NO direction, no goal, just It MIGHT Get Loud, and it doesn't take long for them to develop a rapport. The initial nervousness may have been a result of the self-doubt many (even famous!) artists feel about their work, and wondering how they will be judged by musicians they believe are BETTER than they are, which may or may not be true, it's a mindset of humility in the presence of someone they admire & respect, perhaps even emulate. This is true of Page, for the up & comers, as it is for the newer musicians. No egos get in the way of a fantastic, one of a kind, never to be repeated, jam session experience. :-) One will never regret buying this DVD/movie, for it will be watched with the same pleasure repeatedly over the years. Plus, how long has it been since we've heard ANY thing LIVE from Led Zeppelin? Too long! Here's your chance to see & hear Page in his element, the same goes for all of them, as they soon forget the cameras, the audience, everything but the music.

Jimmy Page, The Edge, and Jack White meet for some `talk' and a session. The result is enriched by clips of music by the 3 bands, plus some of their influences. Something like a United Nations of rock music. The 3 guitarists are from different countries (England, Ireland, and the US), and since they are also of 3 different `generations', they have slightly different stories to tell.Page, of my generation, and one of the stars of my favorites Led Zeppelin (up on top together with the Stones), has most to tell in terms of rock history. I would have loved to see more Yardbirds here.In comparison, The Edge has a shorter history, but a much more political one, with U2's exposure to the times of Irish terrorism and clashes with the British forces of order. The Edge is also the most technical one of the three.White, the youngest, draws heavily on his blues roots, playing old records, and showing the simplicity of a basic approach (e.g. building a `guitar' with a coke bottle).The result? Ear candy for rock fans. Is it a good movie? No way. Too fragmented, too many snippets. It is like appetizers for main course, many of them. Can I give it less than 5 stars? No way. It is too much fun to let any dissatisfaction crawl in. Yes, it might have been done better.

None of the three here is really captivating in both capacities.I tried thinking what other players would have excelled both at playing and revealing insights about the allure and their own mastery of electric guitar.

King (with Lucille), and maybe Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, or Buddy Guy.Fans of Page, Edge, and White will enjoy their idols' segments here, but those seeking fresh revelations about the electric gee-tar will find considerably more inspiration watching the DVD of one of Eric Clapton's Crossroads Festivals.It must be said, however, that the moment when Page rips into the intro of ""Whole Lotta Love"", while Edge and White look on in wonder, is something to see...",3,It Does Get Dull,1266278400,"02 16, 2010",2010,1260,"['idea', 'movie', 'good', 'one', 'explore', 'enduring', 'appeal', 'electric', 'guitar', 'interviews', 'interaction', 'three', 'guitar', 'greats.In', 'practice', 'however', 'film', 'curiously', 'flat', 'little', 'illumination', 'subject.The', 'problem', 'three', 'players', 'interviewed', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Edge', 'are', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', ""'re"", 'playing', 'when', ""'re"", 'talking', 'Jack', 'White', 'more', 'interesting', 'talking', 'playing', 'None', 'three', 'here', 'really', 'captivating', 'capacities.I', 'tried', 'thinking', 'what', 'other', 'players', 'would', 'have', 'excelled', 'playing', 'revealing', 'insights', 'allure', 'own', 'mastery', 'electric', 'guitar', 'names', 'came', 'mind', 'much', 'thought', 'were', 'John', 'Fogerty', 'Boss', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'Neil', 'Young', 'Pete', 'Townshend', 'Les', 'Paul', 'B.B', 'King', 'Lucille', 'maybe', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Buddy', 'Guy.Fans', 'Page', 'Edge', 'White', 'will', 'enjoy', 'idols', 'segments', 'here', 'seeking', 'fresh', 'revelations', 'electric', 'gee-tar', 'will', 'find', 'considerably', 'more', 'inspiration', 'watching', 'DVD', 'one', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Crossroads', 'Festivals.It', 'must', 'be', 'said', 'however', 'moment', 'when', 'Page', 'intro', 'Whole', 'Lotta', 'Love', 'Edge', 'White', 'look', 'wonder', 'something', 'see']",N/A

In particular, though, since I have heard of the great works of Edge and Jimmy Page, I was refreshed to see the intense lifeblood of music in Jack White.  I'm from the old school of Rock so perhaps I am jaded but I had not seen anyone of particular talent or inspiration until I saw Jack White on this DVD.  My faith in Rock music, even in music itself, was rewarded in the talents of this man.

Don't get me wrong.....The Edge is in one of the worlds biggest bands, has sold millions of records and has tons of fans but he is not cut of the same cloth!  Jimmy & Jack are the blues type who can play a song that is never played the same way twice.....they are at home playing a cigar box guitar or cheap piece of Japanese plastic and make it sing.......they can get as basic as it gets and make wonderful music.  The Edge cannot do that and is only about electronics and effects.  They are different.  I don't like all of Jack Whites music but the stuff I do like is amazing.....he is pushing the envelope and trying new things like puitting piano strings on his guitar.  He is constantly innovating just like Jimmy was in his heyday.

1286073,A5N992ESD6UHW,B002RVZV9K,"Jonny Lee ""Boothill Gunslinger""","[3, 8]","I will have to disagree with the last four-star reviewer who's review was titled ""Two Greats and One.....???""  He seems to think that Jack White is in the same iconic league as Jimmy Page.  What in God's name could he be thinking?  Jack White is a hack when it comes to playing guitar. So what? He can use a slide bar, big freakin' deal.  He sings like a girl and plays like a ninny.  I'm not even a blues-type guitarist; I'm a metal/folk guitarist/mandolinist, and I could out blues-riff and out blues-lick Jack White any day of the week.  After teaching him a thing or two about guitar-playing, I would have to rip that ridiculous hat off of his head and throw it in the rubbish with his ""plastic"" guitar and his ""plastic"" guitar playing as well. It's clearly evident that the only reason he is in the music business is because he just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Not only does he not belong in the same room as Jimmy Page, but he would have run home like a sissy girl if he had ever gone up against the likes of blues guitar players like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, Dickey Betts, and Billy Gibbons.The Edge admitted in the movie that he simplifies everything.  When he was showing his ""adjusted"" Major E chord, it was clear that he had removed the G# and the lower B (5th string 2nd fret).  The resulting chord sounded like all the other garbage that U2 has put out...tinny, sustained without body, and monotonous. I agree with ""Two Greats and One.....???"" in that I don't think I have ever heard him perform an awesome solo in any song he has ever done...and that's even within the safety net of recording in a studio.  It's all real banausic, straightforward, single-note, boring nonsense, and, by the way, ""The"" is a STUPID name. However, one aside about The Edge that puts him above Jack White--at least he has some humility when in the presence of a guitar master like Page. At least he seems to have some personality and it's clear that the music business fame hasn't gone to his head like the dork with the goofy hat, Mr. No Riff.As far as the film itself, it's as flawed as a...well, as a flaw! There wasn't ANYONE to interview these guys, and they were left holding the ""interview mic"" themselves and certainly didn't do a very good job of it. What was the whole sequence about the child actor acting like a little Jack White about? That didn't fit into the scheme of things at all! And worst of all, what in the name of all that is holy were they linking Jimmy Page to a Fender Stratocaster for anyway? Sure, it may have been his first guitar, but they should have brought to light the acquisition of his first Gibson Les Paul instead. There was a reason Jimmy didn't keep playing Strats and moved to Les Pauls, and they missed it here.  One last question...Why, ""The Weight?""  Why would they pick a mid- to sub-standard song that relied more upon the lyrics and their presentation than the melody when doing a video about the guitar? Shouldn't the producers have picked a more blues guitar-based song for the three to perform together as a grand finale? How about something like Led Zeppelin's ""You Shook Me"" or ""The Lemon Song"" or even ""I Cant' Quit You, Babe?"" You know, ""All Right Now"" by Free would have been better than ""The Weight."" The production team just wasn't firing on all cylinders here.Four stars for a very limited amount of Jimmy Page footage, minus one star for Jack ""No Riff"" White, and minus one-half star for The. The is a guitar player who simply cannot play a stylish solo, but does display a bit of modesty that keeps him far above Jack ""I Love Me"" White as a person. 2 1/2 stars.",3,One Great and Two...?,1277164800,"06 22, 2010",2010,3661,"['will', 'have', 'disagree', 'last', 'four-star', 'reviewer', 'who', 'review', 'was', 'titled', 'Two', 'Greats', 'One', '..', 'think', 'Jack', 'White', 'same', 'iconic', 'league', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'What', 'God', 'name', 'could', 'be', 'thinking', 'Jack', 'White', 'hack', 'when', 'playing', 'guitar', 'what', 'can', 'use', 'slide', 'bar', 'big', 'freakin', 'deal', 'girl', 'plays', 'ninny', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'blues-type', 'guitarist', ""'m"", 'metal/folk', 'guitarist/mandolinist', 'could', 'out', 'blues-riff', 'blues-lick', 'Jack', 'White', 'day', 'week', 'teaching', 'thing', 'two', 'guitar-playing', 'would', 'have', 'rip', 'ridiculous', 'head', 'throw', 'rubbish', 'plastic', 'guitar', 'plastic', 'guitar', 'playing', 'as', 'well', 'clearly', 'evident', 'only', 'reason', 'music', 'business', 'just', 'happened', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'Not', 'only', 'not', 'belong', 'same', 'room', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'would', 'have', 'run', 'home', 'sissy', 'girl', 'had', 'ever', 'gone', 'up', 'likes', 'blues', 'guitar', 'players', 'Stevie', 'Ray', 'Vaughan', 'Robert', 'Cray', 'Eric', 'Clapton', 'Dickey', 'Betts', 'Billy', 'Gibbons.The', 'Edge', 'admitted', 'movie', 'everything', 'When', 'was', 'showing', 'adjusted', 'Major', 'E', 'chord', 'was', 'clear', 'had', 'removed', 'G', 'lower', 'B', '5th', 'string', '2nd', 'fret', 'resulting', 'chord', 'sounded', 'other', 'garbage', 'U2', 'put', 'out', 'tinny', 'sustained', 'body', 'monotonous', 'agree', 'Two', 'Greats', 'One', '..', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'perform', 'awesome', 'solo', 'song', 'ever', 'done', 'even', 'safety', 'net', 'recording', 'studio', 'real', 'banausic', 'straightforward', 'single-note', 'boring', 'nonsense', 'way', 'STUPID', 'name', 'However', 'one', 'aside', 'Edge', 'Jack', 'White', 'least', 'humility', 'when', 'presence', 'guitar', 'master', 'Page', 'least', 'have', 'personality', 'clear', 'music', 'business', 'fame', ""n't"", 'gone', 'head', 'dork', 'goofy', 'hat', 'Mr.', 'No', 'Riff.As', 'far', 'film', 'as', 'flawed', 'well', 'flaw', 'was', ""n't"", 'ANYONE', 'interview', 'guys', 'were', 'left', 'holding', 'interview', 'mic', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'What', 'was', 'whole', 'sequence', 'child', 'actor', 'acting', 'little', 'Jack', 'White', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'scheme', 'things', 'worst', 'what', 'name', 'holy', 'were', 'linking', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'Fender', 'Stratocaster', 'anyway', 'Sure', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'guitar', 'should', 'have', 'brought', 'light', 'acquisition', 'first', 'Gibson', 'Les', 'Paul', 'instead', 'was', 'reason', 'Jimmy', 'did', ""n't"", 'keep', 'playing', 'Strats', 'moved', 'Les', 'Pauls', 'missed', 'here', 'One', 'last', 'question', 'Why', 'Weight', 'Why', 'would', 'pick', 'mid-', 'sub-standard', 'song', 'relied', 'more', 'lyrics', 'presentation', 'melody', 'when', 'doing', 'video', 'guitar', 'Should', ""n't"", 'producers', 'have', 'picked', 'more', 'blues', 'guitar-based', 'song', 'three', 'perform', 'together', 'grand', 'finale', 'How', 'something', 'Led', 'Zeppelin', 'Shook', 'Lemon', 'Song', 'even', 'Cant', 'Quit', 'Babe', 'know', 'Right', 'Now', 'Free', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'Weight', 'production', 'team', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'firing', 'cylinders', 'here.Four', 'stars', 'very', 'limited', 'amount', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'footage', 'one', 'star', 'Jack', 'No', 'Riff', 'White', 'one-half', 'star', 'guitar', 'player', 'who', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'play', 'stylish', 'solo', 'display', 'bit', 'modesty', 'far', 'Jack', 'Love', 'White', 'person', '2', '1/2', 'stars']",N/A

1286076,A356RFKNIG043B,B002RVZV9K,K. Swanson,"[0, 0]","It's a good idea: three separate generations of rock guitarists sharing their love of the guitar, reminiscing about starting out, and then jamming. And the first two parts work nicely. Alas and sadly, the end jam goes nowhere fast and is rather anti-climactic. But by then I was picking along on an unplugged Strat, like any player who watches this is almost forced to do early on, and smiling at how much joy these stringed planks of wood have brought into my life. Famous or unknown, we all love that instrument dearly, and this love letter to it rings true despite its faults.Still, any real fan of one or more of these guys will dig it, even if just for the pleasant tours through their past. I learned to play electric mainly from the riffs of Jimi and Jimmy, so walking through Page's guitar/instrument vault (good God, the Pauls he must have) was worth the viewing alone for me. Insert Tufnel reference here. He also comes off as a wise and gentlemanly fellow, and the tour through Headley Grange is a true treat for the Zep fans as he shows the hallway where Bonzo tracked Levee (which is also by far the most sampled drum sound in hip-hop, times ten).I've never been a huge U2 fan, but I respect their stamina and love some of their early albums. I saw their Unforgettable Fire tour and was amazed at how Edge did so much with so little playing; as a minimalist he is a genius, I'll give him that. And he admits as much here, crediting his effects with most of his inspiration. He too comes off as a very decent fellow.Jack White seems the odd man out; no legend by a long shot, his love of old school country blues is his only real link here to my mind, and he seems like a bit of a poser at times next to the relaxed demeanor of the other two. Still, he's a decent player, if hardly in Page's league (listen to the best Stripes/Raconteurs, then listen to Zep 3, 4, etc.). But he is the weak link here. I think he was included to get the ""alternative"" crowd into the theatre, but many other young players would have made more sense; Corgan might have been perfect, or even John Mayer, who can really play the blues when he feels like it.But after all the trips down memory lane from each, the end jam is flaccid. Too many cooks produce little broth here; a rhythm section would have been a real treat, say Simon Phillips and Tal Oakenfeld, and the jam might have exploded a little or a lot. As it is, there's no major sparks, just some okay playing on one of Page's most derivative blues workouts, In My Time Of Dying, and a few other weak strolls through riffs by each, but never a well-paced full tune. A very typical rock jam, in fact!But the highlight here might be when Page starts playing the uber-dinosaur riff from Whole Lotta Love (thank you Willie Dixon), and Edge jumps up from his chair to watch his fingers. You can almost see him and White thinking, ""Ah, it's in fifth and seventh position, no open E at the nut, wow, there it is, the classic great dumb riff of them all!"" That, and the generally artistic and intelligent tone, make It Might Get Loud well worth watching for fans of these guys, and the electric guitar in general. But if you're looking for smokin' geetar playing, get the Zep dvd set, or the latest Jeff Beck dvd, etc.This film is more about the love of music than music itself...and that's just fine. Any film that lets a Zep fan sit with Page as he plays some of his favorite old records, smiling in glee (and wiping his nose over and over, some things never change!), well, that's a film made by a fellow who understands the hold that the electric guitar will always have.If they remade this with Beck, Eddie V, and Corgan or Mayer, I'd hardly complain!",4,"Mainly for fans, but very well done",1263168000,"01 11, 2010",2010,3697,"['good', 'idea', 'three', 'separate', 'generations', 'rock', 'guitarists', 'sharing', 'love', 'guitar', 'reminiscing', 'starting', 'out', 'then', 'jamming', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'work', 'nicely', 'Alas', 'sadly', 'end', 'jam', 'nowhere', 'fast', 'rather', 'anti-climactic', 'then', 'was', 'picking', 'along', 'unplugged', 'Strat', 'player', 'who', 'almost', 'forced', 'do', 'early', 'smiling', 'how', 'much', 'joy', 'stringed', 'planks', 'wood', 'have', 'brought', 'life', 'Famous', 'unknown', 'love', 'instrument', 'dearly', 'love', 'letter', 'true', 'faults.Still', 'real', 'fan', 'one', 'more', 'guys', 'will', 'dig', 'even', 'just', 'pleasant', 'tours', 'past', 'learned', 'play', 'electric', 'mainly', 'riffs', 'Jimi', 'Jimmy', 'so', 'walking', 'Page', 'guitar/instrument', 'vault', 'good', 'God', 'Pauls', 'must', 'have', 'was', 'worth', 'viewing', 'alone', 'Insert', 'Tufnel', 'reference', 'here', 'also', 'off', 'wise', 'gentlemanly', 'fellow', 'tour', 'Headley', 'Grange', 'true', 'treat', 'Zep', 'fans', 'hallway', 'where', 'Bonzo', 'tracked', 'Levee', 'also', 'far', 'most', 'sampled', 'drum', 'sound', 'hip-hop', 'times', 'ten', '.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'huge', 'U2', 'fan', 'respect', 'stamina', 'love', 'early', 'albums', 'saw', 'Unforgettable', 'Fire', 'tour', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'Edge', 'did', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', 'playing', 'minimalist', 'genius', ""'ll"", 'give', 'as', 'much', 'here', 'crediting', 'effects', 'most', 'inspiration', 'too', 'off', 'very', 'decent', 'fellow.Jack', 'White', 'odd', 'man', 'legend', 'long', 'shot', 'love', 'old', 'school', 'country', 'blues', 'only', 'real', 'link', 'here', 'mind', 'bit', 'poser', 'times', 'relaxed', 'demeanor', 'other', 'two', 'Still', 'decent', 'player', 'hardly', 'Page', 'league', 'listen', 'best', 'Stripes/Raconteurs', 'then', 'Zep', '3', '4', 'etc.', 'weak', 'link', 'here', 'think', 'was', 'included', 'get', 'alternative', 'crowd', 'theatre', 'many', 'other', 'young', 'players', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'more', 'sense', 'Corgan', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'perfect', 'even', 'John', 'Mayer', 'who', 'can', 'really', 'play', 'blues', 'when', 'it.But', 'trips', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'end', 'jam', 'flaccid', 'Too', 'many', 'cooks', 'produce', 'little', 'broth', 'here', 'rhythm', 'section', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'real', 'treat', 'say', 'Simon', 'Phillips', 'Tal', 'Oakenfeld', 'jam', 'might', 'have', 'exploded', 'little', 'lot', 'major', 'sparks', 'just', 'okay', 'playing', 'one', 'Page', 'most', 'derivative', 'blues', 'workouts', 'My', 'Time', 'Dying', 'few', 'other', 'weak', 'strolls', 'riffs', 'never', 'well-paced', 'full', 'tune', 'very', 'typical', 'rock', 'jam', 'fact', 'highlight', 'here', 'might', 'be', 'when', 'Page', 'playing', 'uber-dinosaur', 'riff', 'Whole', 'Lotta', 'Love', 'thank', 'Willie', 'Dixon', 'Edge', 'jumps', 'up', 'chair', 'watch', 'fingers', 'can', 'almost', 'see', 'White', 'thinking', 'Ah', 'fifth', 'seventh', 'position', 'open', 'E', 'nut', 'wow', 'classic', 'great', 'dumb', 'riff', 'generally', 'artistic', 'intelligent', 'tone', 'make', 'Might', 'Get', 'Loud', 'well', 'watching', 'fans', 'guys', 'electric', 'guitar', 'general', ""'re"", 'looking', 'smokin', 'geetar', 'playing', 'get', 'Zep', 'dvd', 'set', 'latest', 'Jeff', 'Beck', 'dvd', 'etc.This', 'film', 'more', 'love', 'music', 'music', 'just', 'fine', 'film', 'Zep', 'fan', 'sit', 'Page', 'favorite', 'old', 'records', 'smiling', 'glee', 'wiping', 'nose', 'things', 'never', 'change', 'well', 'film', 'made', 'fellow', 'who', 'hold', 'electric', 'guitar', 'will', 'always', 'have.If', 'remade', 'Beck', 'Eddie', 'V', 'Corgan', 'Mayer', ""'d"", 'hardly', 'complain']",N/A

Particular highlights for me are the facial expressions and fascination of the other two as Jimmy Page plays the opening riff on Whole Lotta Love, and watching The Edge through the use of effects magic playing Pride, and giving the impression through the echo effect of playing two different instruments.  I also enjoyed Jack White's rendition of Take The Elevator, and he seems to be somehow channeling Johnny Depp. Jimmy also explains Kashmir and gives a quick demo.I found my admiration for Jimmy Page in particular grew because not only is he a guitar great, he is also a cool guy.  The Edge impressed me with his dedication to pursuing the perfect sound, and reminded me of Les Paul in that respect inLes Paul - Chasing Sound, a movie I highly recommend.  Jack White impressed me with his passion for the guitar.I also enjoyed the concert footage excerpts particulary the soloing on the double neck guitar on Stairway To Heaven.If you're like me you'll be impressed by the passion and dedication and talent of these three.  Some of the most interesting bits are in the deleted scenes and extended footage.I hope you found this helpful, and think you will enjoy it.",4,When guitar heroes meet,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,1844,"['most', 'people', 'learning', 'guitar', 'one', 'earliest', 'ambitions', 'was', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'intro', 'Stairway', 'Heaven', 'played', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'So', ""'re"", 'guitar', 'dvd', 'well', 'worth', 'exploring.It', 'Jack', 'White', 'constructing', 'own', 'guitar', 'makeshift', 'elements', 'out', 'Edge', 'kid', 'also', 'created', 'own', 'electric', 'guitar', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'got', 'first', 'guitar', 'when', 'previous', 'owner', 'house', 'family', 'moved', 'left', 'guitar', 'behind.As', 'get', 'further', 'movie', 'more', 'fascinating', 'explore', 'music', 'musical', 'background', 'development', 'creative', 'influences', 'three', 'outstanding', 'guitarists', 'Particular', 'highlights', 'are', 'facial', 'expressions', 'fascination', 'other', 'two', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'opening', 'riff', 'Whole', 'Lotta', 'Love', 'watching', 'Edge', 'use', 'effects', 'magic', 'playing', 'Pride', 'giving', 'impression', 'echo', 'effect', 'playing', 'two', 'different', 'instruments', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'Jack', 'White', 'rendition', 'Take', 'Elevator', 'be', 'somehow', 'channeling', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Jimmy', 'also', 'Kashmir', 'quick', 'demo.I', 'found', 'admiration', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'particular', 'grew', 'because', 'not', 'only', 'guitar', 'great', 'also', 'cool', 'guy', 'Edge', 'impressed', 'dedication', 'pursuing', 'perfect', 'sound', 'reminded', 'Les', 'Paul', 'respect', 'inLes', 'Paul', 'Chasing', 'Sound', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Jack', 'White', 'impressed', 'passion', 'guitar.I', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'concert', 'footage', 'excerpts', 'particulary', 'soloing', 'double', 'neck', 'guitar', 'Stairway', 'Heaven.If', ""'re"", ""'ll"", 'be', 'impressed', 'passion', 'dedication', 'talent', 'three', 'most', 'interesting', 'bits', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'extended', 'footage.I', 'hope', 'found', 'helpful', 'think', 'will', 'enjoy']",N/A

Something about the touch of stringed instruments is sensual, commanding-even a weapon of war or protest. It can make you dream, fall in love, remember lost love, observe the love that past you by-it all comes from the heart.And elder statesman of the guitar, Jimmy Page selects 2 guys who have completely different styles. Are they good? Yes, in their own way-they are killers and very passionate. What I liked was the humor and self-deprecating manner. The wit, the smiles, the 'oh yes...I get it-how lovely"", feelings and the mutual admiration. Watch Page, as he studies the ""Young Turks"", with the smile and penetrating eyes.Jiimmy Page is generous with his secrets, as time permits. White and The Edge, warm to Jimmy's candid take on music and how he shrugs off tunes like, ""Stairway To Heaven"", as he does a nice demo on his double-neck Gibson SG with a 12 string and 6 string neck.This has to be one of the best guitar (and even if you don't play) and most enjoyable DVDs on music. Nice to see, the musical roots that Jack White explains, in his musical development.Imagine installing a custom harmonica microphone for his vocals that pulls right out of the body of a modified guitar he designed. And the distortion with melodic overtones, on Jack's voice, issomething to behold. All three men, are highly intelligent (Page really shines here) and creative composers.This is superior to any concert film you may see, because it is personal and intimate. Watch the expressions of the other two, while one makes hisnarrative. Yes, turn it up loud, own it, but here is the big point-watch it multiple times.

Truly deserves a five-star rating. 'It Might Get Loud' brings together three of the most inventive, trend-setting and innovative guitarists - namely Jimmy Page, U2's The Edge and The White Stripe's mastermind Jack White. This DVD is priceless - the way these three six-string pioneers compare notes, tell stories, try to learn from each other, etc. This DVD had some super-rare U2 footage from 1979-80 that I have never seen before. Was sort of taken with where they show Jack White 'constructing' his own homemade guitar and then where he drives to a remote cabin and piddle around a bit on the piano - playing some vintage (I'm guessing) blues number. Plus, I loved the scene where you're invited into Jimmy Page's den - where he is a obviously a major vinyl collector.

For me, the ""show"" was stolen by Jim Page and Jack White.  To see a living legend like Jimmy Page discuss what is was like to develop his sound was incredible.  Then, there is Jack White.  I'd never even heard of him (not my kinda music).  Yes, the guy has some serious attitude, but it's partly that attitude (and incredible musical talent) that draws you to him in some way.  You want to hear more, know more about his blues and raw rock.  No doubt some of White's ""attitude"" is just performance, but you can't escape the ""raw"" energy that the guy displays on screen.  For a pure music lover, this movie might be lacking, since the only music you really hear are snippets from this or that famous track, and a few you've probably never heard.  There are no complete performances.  So what's to like?  It's hard to put a finger on it.  I'm not particularly a guitar fan, but I thought this was a great DVD.

There is an undeniable charm to this film, even if White's pretentious preciousness gets under your skin, as it did mine, and that irrespective of his technical ability. One would expect an Irishman to be charming, but Dave Evans is all that and more. The Edge, free of the yapping Maw known as Bono, conveys an intelligent and humble regard for his craft that he saw as his only way out of an Irish economy that was devastatingly empty of promise. He is grateful to the schoolmaster who let them use a clasroom to rehaerse what they didn't know how to do, and archive footage of the lot of them as kids, contrasted with the footage of an overblown performance at Slane Castle presents their career trajectory in vivid detail. But it is his humble but intelligent regard for his job that strikes as so much more eloquent than the endless righteous babble of his vocalist. It's a great reminder that U2 has a lot more to say when Bono keeps his mouth shut.Edge is clearly interested in what Jimmy Page has to say. In many respects U2 was part of rock's reaction to what Page stood for: corporate fueled excess. And yet, as Page tells his story, it is quite clear that he was very focused on advancing his craft and taking a tradition of rural and brutal and feral blues from teh American south into the hearts first of working class Brit kids and later to a much more inflated platform. But it is his fascination with what goes on inside the spaces between the six, 8 or 12 strings of his instruments, the historical precedents of his own interests that have fueld his imagination and the almost kismet occurence of events that changed teh course of his life. His first guitar was one that was left in the house into which his family moved after WW2. The house in which they recorded LZ4 offered them sonic ambiences that, while he incorrectly identifies as being the first use of such in rock music - Traffic and Fairport had already repaired to country homes, albeit more rural and humble, for seminal recordings - still alert you to the fact that for all the excesses on tour, when it came time to get to recording, it was very much artists exploring their craft.It may be that the contrast between an Irishman and an Englishman generate subliminal messages, such as Edge driving his own car and Page being chauffeured, but each of them regards the other as essential to the dialogue of guitarcraft. Edge boils his tea in a modest kitchen and talks about his obsessions with the technologies of the guitar and the effects pedals, while Page waxes almost nostaligically over seminal recordings from his youth and offers a self effacing account that if you believed all that you read about him as a session player, you'd be convinced he played on absoluetly every record ever made. He is quite funny about film work that led to ""Goldfinger"" and Shirley Bassey passing out after the first take.Between both men, there is a very serious and committed regard for preparing themselves so that the music plays them. While consummate enough as professionals, they have lost none of the innocence that infuses them with wonder.In almost every frame White is clearly jarring or out of his element. There's no denying that he has talent to spare and a way of doing things, but there's also no denying that there is something quintessentially oblivious to that sacred innocence that Page and Edge still have. A sense of it all being contrived haunts his every utterance, and while he, like anyone else who attempts a life as a professional musician, has suffered disappointments as well as success, it could all be an absolute Ground Hog Day and start all over with nary a well placed toussled hair awry. While not exactly patronizing him, Page and Evans know they are someplace else, even as they all play together.My guess is that they are two men who have attained an enlightenment that still eludes White, no matter how much he exactly nails a sound or technique. For all 3 men, music offered a way out of a life that none of them wanted to be stuck in, but in Page and Edge there is a recognition that the gods smiled kindly on them and that their good fortune lay in their ability to silence themsleves in just such a way that Music might lean over and take them into its confidence.

1286087,A6JQ6I9LGKXBG,B002RVZV9K,Paul Wiseman,"[1, 1]","""It Might Get Loud'' is a joyous celebration of rock n roll. It tells us what's behind the guitar solos that rock stadiums and music clubs -- the years, sometimes decades, of experimentation, collaboration and self-doubt. Of practicing over and over to find the sound that conveys precisely the emotions roiling inside a song. The documentary brings together three extraordinary guitarists -- Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White -- and lets them talk about their music for a good hour and a half.I was entranced.They are three very different men and very different artists. Page, of course, is rock royalty, and he's a regal presence here with his white mane and striking features. He's a low-key, gifted storyteller, who seems to light up when he plays his guitar. (Page is also one of the film's associate producers, which might explain why he comes off so well.) The Edge uses technology to perfect his sound -- the sound that makes U2 so unique. Even now, he confesses to moments of terrifying self-doubt. It's somehow reassuring to learn that the ultimate big-stadium rock band started out practicing, and floundering, in a little Irish classroom after school.White is a tough man to like. He's edgy and tormented, pale and doughy -- Edward Scissorhands on a Snickers bar binge. But I came away admiring him anyway. He's on a single-minded quest to create music pure and true. He admits at one point that everything he does amounts to an attempt to produce something as honest and clean as bluesman Son House's gritty a cappella song ""Grinnin' in Your Face.'' Sometimes he seems to be trying to rip the music right out of himself. The film's most unsettling moment is a shot of White blood-streaked guitar at the end of a performance.If you want to hear about groupies and drugs, this isn't the film for you. You won't learn about Page's demons or even get any clarity about the murky relationship between Jack and Meg White. This is all about music. And thank God for that. In a way, it's a rock tutorial. I came away eager to listen to The Jam, one of the punk era bands that inspired U2.

I love guitars, and rock music, and have followed the music of Page and The Edge for many years. I've built instruments, watched many rockumentaries. Sounded fascinating.It isn't. First, the central concept of having these three guitarists get together and talk shop just never catches fire.  Page and The Edge may be brilliant people with a lot to say, but they don't say it in this film; they're deferential, introverted, and apparently just not motivated to engage in a lot of talk about what they do. Page seems like rock aristocracy with nothing to prove--true--and just hangs out, making benign, genial small talk.  The Edge talks about how he likes to make effects, which is fine, if not revelatory.And then there's Jack White.  Many people have commented that he's the odd man out, not in the same league as the others as far as either musical prowess or influence, and I have to say, I agree, although it may reflect my being in an older generation than his fans.  But I found him very pretentious and peculiar, with his constant emphasis on how deeply into the blues he is, and how authentic he is, and how he plays plastic guitars, and wants making music to be a struggle.  He dresses up his mini-me son to look just like himself--looking like the Blues Brothers, and just as authentic.  Nothing wrong with being eccentric if you make great music--bring it on--but at least in this film he plays nothing to distinguish himself.I expected these guys to at least talk with their music and play some interesting stuff together, but no.  Maybe it was unreasonable to expect, given how different their styles are, but still, I was surprised at how uninspired their jamming was.Lacking any real chemistry, and any great musical interplay, the film includes a lot of archival footage.  Some of this interesting--I loved seeing Jimmy Page performing as a youth, and early U2 footage, in which they looked like the Bay City Rollers.  But I wouldn't say it was worth sitting through an otherwise slow, full-length film for those snippets.  I'd recommend this to hard-core fans only, and especially fans of Jack White, since any Zeppelin or U2 show is a lot more entertaining than this.",2,A Lot Less Interesting Than I'd Expected,1277856000,"06 30, 2010",2010,2283,"['When', 'first', 'saw', 'trailer', 'film', 'thought', 'Oh', 'Boy', 'just', 'movie', 'love', 'guitars', 'rock', 'music', 'have', 'followed', 'music', 'Page', 'Edge', 'many', 'years', ""'ve"", 'built', 'instruments', 'watched', 'many', 'rockumentaries', 'Sounded', 'fascinating.It', ""n't"", 'First', 'central', 'concept', 'having', 'three', 'guitarists', 'get', 'together', 'talk', 'shop', 'just', 'never', 'catches', 'fire', 'Page', 'Edge', 'may', 'be', 'brilliant', 'people', 'lot', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', ""'re"", 'deferential', 'introverted', 'apparently', 'just', 'not', 'motivated', 'engage', 'lot', 'talk', 'what', 'do', 'Page', 'rock', 'aristocracy', 'nothing', 'prove', 'true', 'just', 'hangs', 'out', 'making', 'benign', 'genial', 'small', 'talk', 'Edge', 'talks', 'how', 'make', 'effects', 'fine', 'not', 'revelatory.And', 'then', 'Jack', 'White', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'commented', 'odd', 'man', 'out', 'not', 'same', 'league', 'others', 'as', 'far', 'musical', 'prowess', 'influence', 'have', 'say', 'agree', 'may', 'reflect', 'being', 'older', 'generation', 'fans', 'found', 'very', 'pretentious', 'peculiar', 'constant', 'emphasis', 'how', 'deeply', 'blues', 'how', 'authentic', 'how', 'plastic', 'guitars', 'making', 'music', 'be', 'struggle', 'up', 'mini-me', 'son', 'look', 'just', 'looking', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'just', 'authentic', 'Nothing', 'wrong', 'being', 'eccentric', 'make', 'great', 'music', 'bring', 'least', 'film', 'nothing', 'distinguish', 'himself.I', 'expected', 'guys', 'least', 'talk', 'music', 'play', 'interesting', 'stuff', 'together', 'Maybe', 'was', 'unreasonable', 'expect', 'given', 'how', 'different', 'styles', 'are', 'still', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'uninspired', 'jamming', 'was.Lacking', 'real', 'chemistry', 'great', 'musical', 'interplay', 'film', 'lot', 'archival', 'footage', 'interesting', 'loved', 'seeing', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'performing', 'youth', 'early', 'U2', 'footage', 'looked', 'Bay', 'City', 'Rollers', 'would', ""n't"", 'say', 'was', 'worth', 'sitting', 'otherwise', 'slow', 'full-length', 'film', 'snippets', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'hard-core', 'fans', 'only', 'especially', 'fans', 'Jack', 'White', 'Zeppelin', 'U2', 'show', 'lot', 'more', 'entertaining']",N/A
1286094,ANM2SCEUL3WL1,B002RVZV9K,Pristine,"[14, 16]","I like all three guys, and all three bands they are most famously known with.  While the obvious climax of a documentary about three guitarists is a jam session, I think it's a mistake to head in that direction.  I read here of guys who bemoan more music, less talk.  I also read about how this was a poor combination of guitar players.  While I may personally prefer a trifecta consisting of John McLaughlin, Lee Rinaldo, and Thor, the combo given in ""It May Get Loud"" made perfect sense to me.  In a way, it's really the story of how Page's legacy splits into two directions generations later.How do I know this?  It's on their faces when they get together, talk shop, and trade riffs.  Jimmy Page's roots are in the Delta blues, which were born from Slave songs and prison work chants.  Jack White talked about that same raw soul that one hears in Son House, which led to Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf.  All Page's heroes as well.  The Edge, from a Brian Eno era, seems removed from it all.  Not in a bad way, but you can definitely see his blank expression when the other two go into it.  But the Edge is basically a logical progression of Page's electronic experimentation with the echoplex, theramin, bowed guitar, leslie speakers and recording studio tricks.  Jack White is the raw, soulful, bluesy side of Page's playing in Zeppelin and the Yardbirds.  When White is banging away at his guitar, you can definitely see how much more Page digs it.The documentary tries to make this correlation, but not outwardly.  I think it gives enough ""scrapbook"" moments from each guy and each band to keep everyone happy.  For those cantankerous reviewers who grumble that there's not enough Jimmy Page and who in the world are those two other guys....careful....your age may be showing.Besides, for any true lover of Jimmy Page's playing, I can't see why they won't love the other two blokes.",4,Careful....your age may be showing depending on how much you loved / hated this documentary,1268611200,"03 15, 2010",2010,1900,"['like', 'three', 'guys', 'three', 'bands', 'are', 'most', 'famously', 'known', 'obvious', 'climax', 'documentary', 'three', 'guitarists', 'jam', 'session', 'think', 'mistake', 'head', 'direction', 'read', 'here', 'guys', 'who', 'bemoan', 'more', 'music', 'less', 'talk', 'also', 'read', 'how', 'was', 'poor', 'combination', 'guitar', 'players', 'may', 'personally', 'prefer', 'trifecta', 'consisting', 'John', 'McLaughlin', 'Lee', 'Rinaldo', 'Thor', 'combo', 'given', 'May', 'Get', 'Loud', 'made', 'perfect', 'sense', 'way', 'really', 'story', 'how', 'Page', 'legacy', 'two', 'directions', 'generations', 'later.How', 'do', 'know', 'when', 'get', 'together', 'talk', 'shop', 'trade', 'riffs', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'roots', 'are', 'Delta', 'blues', 'were', 'born', 'Slave', 'songs', 'prison', 'work', 'chants', 'Jack', 'White', 'talked', 'same', 'raw', 'soul', 'one', 'Son', 'House', 'led', 'Robert', 'Johnson', 'Muddy', 'Waters', 'Howlin', 'Wolf', 'Page', 'heroes', 'as', 'well', 'Edge', 'Brian', 'Eno', 'era', 'removed', 'Not', 'bad', 'way', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'blank', 'expression', 'when', 'other', 'two', 'go', 'Edge', 'basically', 'logical', 'progression', 'Page', 'electronic', 'experimentation', 'echoplex', 'theramin', 'bowed', 'guitar', 'leslie', 'speakers', 'recording', 'studio', 'tricks', 'Jack', 'White', 'raw', 'soulful', 'bluesy', 'side', 'Page', 'playing', 'Zeppelin', 'Yardbirds', 'When', 'White', 'banging', 'away', 'guitar', 'can', 'definitely', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'Page', 'digs', 'it.The', 'documentary', 'tries', 'make', 'correlation', 'not', 'outwardly', 'think', 'enough', 'scrapbook', 'moments', 'guy', 'band', 'keep', 'everyone', 'happy', 'cantankerous', 'reviewers', 'who', 'grumble', 'not', 'enough', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'who', 'world', 'are', 'two', 'other', 'guys', '.careful', '.your', 'age', 'may', 'be', 'showing.Besides', 'true', 'lover', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'playing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love', 'other', 'two', 'blokes']",N/A

The film truly does offer an amazing personal insight into the lives of three gifted and accomplished guitar players who share some of their secrets and insights, which alone is worth the price of admission. In my case I never much cared for the White Stripes or Jack White for that matter, who I feel though he is a truly gifted musician was misplaced in this documentary when you consider he was making company with two other greatly respected guitar masters while he simply hasn't earned such praise. Page and the Edge have earned these top spots, but I felt the third slot should have been reserved for someone as infamous as they, such as the likes of Jeff Beck, Clapton, or maybe Angus Young. White simply didn't seem to fit in my opinion even though strangely I felt compelled to think in some ways he did carry his weight even though he was clearly overshadowed by his far more infamous peers. Beyond this observation all three give some very interesting information about their humble beginings and their love for the guitar, each in their own way seemingly connected by fate to the roots of rock and the blues. It was a real treat watching the communication between all three gentlemen who are truly beyond the childish ideas of hamming it up and trying to do one better on each other. Rather these three men seem comfortably humbled by one another, learning from one another and being enriched by each other, free of any selfish ideas. Being a huge fan of the Edge led me here, but I went away far more interested in the other two men than I had previously been.

The film looks great and held my attention but the same thought kept recurring...nothing against Jack White but why Jack White?  There are any number of others I would have preferred to see (Dick Dale, Robbie Robertson, Richard Thompson, Lindsey Buckingham, Joe Satriani), all who have far more history than Jack White.  Hopefully this will spark an interest in getting more of this kind of thing made, think Peter Gabriel, Tom Waits, Bowie, Byrne, and on and on.

Sure, the screen is smaller but 1) You can go back and see the parts that you you want to see (and even zoom in on the performers fingers) and 2) You get to see the ""Deleted scenes"". (Read on about those.)This documentary was directed by Davis Guggenheim who won lots of awards for directing Al Gore in ""An Inconvenient Truth"". (To make Al Gore seem interesting for two hours, talking about global warming was a challenge that Guggenheim overcame.)The premise is that the Director got three electric guitar geniuses from differejnt cultures and generations in to room to reminisce and play together. Jimmy Page (British) is the elder statesman here; The Edge from U2 (Irish) comes next in the age-line; and Jack White of The White Stripes (Detroit, MI) brings it into the 21st Century.What I expected to see was a ""super session"" in one room for 98 minutes. But that's not what you get. The Director used this ""first time meeting"" as a jumping off point to follow the careers of the three men, jumping from one to the other. There really isn't much footage in the film of the meeting and no complete songs are ever presented. (If you read the credits there are nearly 100 (!) songs excerpted for the soundtrack. There's lots of archival clips of Page in his various bands and Edge and White in their respective musical collaborations as well. But it's still riveting.The DVD includes commentary by the Director and Producer (none of the musicians included) and a 30-minute Press Conference in Toronto that does include Page, White and Edge. But then there ar4e the ""Deleted Scenes"" - 12 of them totaling 26 minutes. It's here we see Page play acoustically for a full song, some on stage jamming and questioning each other and even a section where Edge reveals how he  - and Bono - got their unique names. (Why wasn't this in the film?).This is a min-history of the electric guitar from the mid 1960s to the present and anyone who plays electric guitar will get something from it.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",4,"If you liked the movie, you'll LOVE the DVD!",1261094400,"12 18, 2009",2009,2110,"['missed', 'film', 'when', 'came', 'local', 'theaters', 'am', 'glad', 'got', 'see', 'DVD', 'Sure', 'screen', 'smaller', '1', 'can', 'go', 'back', 'see', 'parts', 'want', 'see', 'even', 'zoom', 'performers', 'fingers', '2', 'get', 'see', 'Deleted', 'scenes', 'Read', 'documentary', 'was', 'directed', 'Davis', 'Guggenheim', 'who', 'won', 'lots', 'awards', 'directing', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Inconvenient', 'Truth', 'make', 'Al', 'Gore', 'seem', 'interesting', 'two', 'hours', 'talking', 'global', 'warming', 'was', 'challenge', 'Guggenheim', 'overcame', 'premise', 'Director', 'got', 'three', 'electric', 'guitar', 'geniuses', 'differejnt', 'cultures', 'generations', 'room', 'reminisce', 'play', 'together', 'Jimmy', 'Page', 'British', 'elder', 'statesman', 'here', 'Edge', 'U2', 'Irish', 'next', 'age-line', 'Jack', 'White', 'White', 'Stripes', 'Detroit', 'MI', '21st', 'Century.What', 'expected', 'see', 'was', 'super', 'session', 'one', 'room', '98', 'minutes', 'not', 'what', 'get', 'Director', 'used', 'first', 'time', 'meeting', 'jumping', 'off', 'point', 'follow', 'careers', 'three', 'men', 'jumping', 'one', 'other', 'really', ""n't"", 'much', 'footage', 'film', 'meeting', 'complete', 'songs', 'are', 'ever', 'presented', 'read', 'credits', 'are', 'nearly', '100', 'songs', 'excerpted', 'soundtrack', 'lots', 'archival', 'clips', 'Page', 'various', 'bands', 'Edge', 'White', 'respective', 'musical', 'collaborations', 'well', 'still', 'riveting.The', 'DVD', 'commentary', 'Director', 'Producer', 'none', 'musicians', 'included', '30-minute', 'Press', 'Conference', 'Toronto', 'include', 'Page', 'White', 'Edge', 'then', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', '12', 'totaling', '26', 'minutes', 'here', 'see', 'Page', 'play', 'acoustically', 'full', 'song', 'stage', 'jamming', 'questioning', 'other', 'even', 'section', 'where', 'Edge', 'how', 'Bono', 'got', 'unique', 'names', 'Why', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', '.This', 'min-history', 'electric', 'guitar', 'mid', '1960s', 'present', 'anyone', 'who', 'electric', 'guitar', 'will', 'get', 'something', 'it.Steve', 'Ramm', 'Anything', 'Phonographic']",N/A

Before you blast me - opinions vary - it's just my opinion.
