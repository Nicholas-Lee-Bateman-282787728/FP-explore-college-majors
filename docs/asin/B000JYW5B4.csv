I remember watching said movie several years ago and was waiting for it to go down in price before I purchased it.

I understand that this is truly a fictional movie but it gives the watcher pretty much an understanding of what may or may not happen within the midst of our government.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie for the humor along with the seriousness.  As for The American President movie starring Michael Douglas and Annette Bening, again this was just an added bonus movie purchased.  I did enjoy the movie with the pace and I thought both actors did a great job in their roles.

The politics of re-election, while the world watches him fall in love is the subject. Michael Douglas is a very believeable President, and Annette Bening is a somewhat less talented love interest.On the other hand, Dave tells of a Presidental look-alike who finds himself suddenly playing the role 'for real'.

1029844,A2XJWS787GHPQD,B000JYW5B4,MISS KITTY,"[0, 0]","I found The American President to be both humorous and romantic.  There was just enough real drama to hold my attention.  Michael Douglas and Anett Bening made a good pairing for the story of a widowed President finding love is a very unusual way.  It showed how being a public servant can keep you from having a life outside of the public arena.  They meet, they fall in love and they make love while under the  microscope that the press puts all public figures under.  Michael J. Fox was great playing a role as an advocate of the right thing to do.  He always plays such roles with gusto.  It makes you believe he is that sort of person in real life.  Martin Sheen as the Chief of Staff proved to be  a good casting.  I loved him in West Wing.  The movie is one that tells the age old story.  &#34; Love conquers all&#34;.  The other movie in this package was Dave.  It got three stars from me.  The movie is about a look alike of the president who is called on the stand in for him at a public function but due to a stroke of the real president he has to become the role player to keep the political bad guys on a roll to due the nasty deeds they had planned.  When the president , Kevin Kline sees a program that is meant to help needy kids get gutted by the bad guys, steps in and stops it from happening.  He calls in an accountant he knows well from his small town and has him figure out what should be obvious to everyone where the money can be found to keep the program alive.  This happens to be a pet project of the first lady and draws them together.  Oh if only this would happen in real politics today.  I won't spoil it by telling all of the details but with this particular package you get two movies worth your time to watch.  Good stories and great actors make for a delightful combination.

Frank Capra's presence can be felt strongly in both films, since they mirror his ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" in wit, romance & human drama.""The American President"" has Michael Douglas helming the White House (couldn't you just see him as President?), a widower whose romance with a lobbyist (a spunky & lovely Annette Bening) sparks controversy. From the noble opening credits of presidents past to scenes of White House functions, the film simply sparkles. Rob Reiner deftly directs this often dense excursion into the tangled web of politics, and how it affects everyone. The film is packed with tons of supporting cast turns, as well as cameo appearances from celebrities & political figures alike. And Douglas is given a show-stopping moment as he fires back at a mud-slinging opponent (Richard Drefuss) on national T.V.""Dave"" is more whimsical than ""The American President"" as it serves up fantasy fulfillment: What if you had the chance to be President for a while? The terrific Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, an ordinary guy that could have very well stepped out of a Capra film. Due to his uncanny resemblance to the Prez, Kovic is tapped to play him during a public function, then is plopped into the White House indefinitely after the real Prez is left comatose after a tryst with his secretary. What develops is how a regular man takes one look at what is going wrong within the administration, and tries his best to fix it; even re-connecting with the Prez's estranged wife, played with stern dignity & charm by Sigourney Weaver. Again, great supporting turns & cameos abound, but the film is clearly Kline's show all the way.Sadly, there are no bonus extras on this double bill, not even some short featurettes.
