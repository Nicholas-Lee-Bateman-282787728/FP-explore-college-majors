1353864,A20QYY9BECJKMA,B003M0NLXS,Jennifer,"[1, 3]","Fantastic, beautifully restored black and white, star-studded film depicting a supposedly happily married man who ends up taking a lover whom he gets pregnant, and then marries while he is still married to his current wife (Joan Fontaine). Now, this traveling salesman has two wives, neither of which knows about the other. Not to mention his lover gives birth to a boy, his son. Lots of twists and turns in this story. You almost feel sorry for this tortured man who feels sick with deceit and lies as he leads a double life.In the end both women find out about one another, and realize they are both married to the same man. That may seem commonplace these days, but back in the 1950's bigamy was definitely a 'no-no'.But wait until the end to see how all of this tangled mess works itself out - some may like the ending and feel justice has been served, and others may think this confused bigamist didn't get what he deserved. You decide...
