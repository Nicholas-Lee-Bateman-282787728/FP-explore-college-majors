Cooper is brought before Bean for horse stealing, but Coop gets off by inventing a story about Lily Langtry, Brennan's fantasy love, who falls for it. He keeps stringing Brennan along with the made-up story throughout the picture, which becomes a bit trying at times. Cooper's stiff ""Yups"" can drive you crazy after a while, too.But Brennan is excellent (he deservedly won an Oscar), and the shoot-out ending in the empty theatre between Coop and him, where Brennan gets to meet his Langtry backstage just before dying, is well done. The music (by Alfred Newman, who went uncredited) is a bit on the ""HEAVY"" side and over-emphatic, as if to make sure we get the point and have the right reactions. But the Gregg Toland photography is marvelous, and William Wyler's direction is superb.

447817,A3N8RZSXKN1OR2,6305082367,Chrijeff,"[2, 2]","Loosely based on the half-legendary Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan), ""the Law West of the Pecos,"" this is the story of an uneasy friendship and how it grows.  Cole Harden (Gary Cooper), a drifting cowboy, is haled into Bean's barroom court and accused of horse theft (the roan he's riding is recognized by Bean's crony Chickenfoot (Paul Hurst) as having been stolen from him), a capital crime in the Old West.  But Bean is obsessed with the British actress Lilly Langtry--the wall behind his bar is plastered with pictures of her--and Cole shrewdly exploits this fact, pretending to be a friend of Lilly's and eventually not only clearing himself of all charges but gaining Bean's liking and respect.  But Bean, besides being a saloonkeeper, self-appointed jurist, and founder of the settlement of Vinegarroon (which he later rechristens Langtry in Lilly's honor), is also a considerable cattleman and a leader of the ranchers' opposition to the homesteaders, and Cole has seen too many range wars to want any part of another one.  When he can't persuade Bean and the farmers to make peace, he gets himself appointed a marshal and maneuvers the Judge into a trap--using Lilly as bait.Anyone who's familiar with Texas history will spot the one glaring inconsistency that voids the whole story: Texas, when she entered the Union, retained ownership of her public lands, and the Federal Homestead Act had no legitimacy within her borders.  Still, if you can ignore that fact, it's a great classic Western and a wonderful story about two strong men and the uneasy relationship that grows between them.  Walter Brennan deservedly won the Best Supporting Oscar for his role, and his Bean (""And that's m'rulin'!"") is one of the most delightful characters in movies, while Cooper's Harden is a definitive example of his ""strong, silent, and shrewd"" Westerner.

447820,A2FOT0QE23VN6J,6305082367,Dr. James Gardner,"[3, 10]","One of the most over-rated westerns around, the first part of this 1940 film is almost insufferable, with every bad clich&eacute; you can think of and such a dearth of action that a pathetic 10 second fight between Cooper's double and another actor is all the excitement you see. Cooper and Brennan race each other for the prize of best mugging in front of the camera, while a gang of undistinguishable sidekicks busies themselves drinking and playing cards.Doris Davenport shows up for a brief ""ain't I just too cute for words"" appearance, and then trounces off, but Cooper's desperate facial expressions warn us that this is not the last time we'll see this maiden in distress. Can a film be worse than this? Of course it can, but not with such a sterling cast and production crew.After all, Walter Brennan was a great actor. He was nominated 4 times for Best Supporting Actor and won 3 times, in 1936 (""Come and Get It""), 1938 (""Kentucky"") and (incredibly)  this film. Personally I think he did even better in films such as ""My Darling Clementine"" (1946) and ""How the West Was Won"" (1962), and of course, in the TV series ""The Real McCoys"".Gary Cooper turned in great performances in such classics as ""High Noon ""(1952) and ""Sergeant York"" (1941).So what went wrong? Perhaps it is William Wyler's direction. Wyler has a distinguished career. Nominated as Best Director 12 times, he won 3 times (""Mrs. Miniver"", ""The Best Years of our Lives"", and ""Ben Hur""). But none of his nominations were for westerns, a genre he rarely worked in.There's a similar problem with the cinematography. Greg Toland was a remarkable photographer, responsible for films such as ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""The Grapes of Wrath"" (1940), ""Dead End"" (1937) and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"". See the connection? Toland also rarely worked on westerns, and his only other westerns were the critically disastrous ""The Outlaw"" (1943) which failed on all dimensions but two (there's a joke here), and the very forgettable ""Cowboy and the Lady"" (1938) that also starred Cooper and Brennan although this was a ""modern"" western and, in truth, not much of a western at all.Jo Swirling worked on films like ""GWTW"" (1939), ""Blood and Sand"" (1941), and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) - but this was his only western. For co-writer Niven Bush this was his first western, and he went on to dabble in the genre with ""Belle Star"" (1941), ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946), and ""The Man From the Alamo"" (1953). Co-writer Stuart Lake was basically involved in writing screenplays about Wyatt Earp (1934, 1939, 1946).Putting aside the lack of background in the western genre, another major problem with this film is the character development. Brennan is the villain of the piece, but he is presented more like a clown than a villain. Sure he has a bunch of thugs that hang people, but Brennan himself is usually drunk, can be easily fooled and outwitted, and has such a crush on Lilly Langtry that he is comical. Couple this with the comic musical score than accompanies Brennan and we get the impression that we're watching ""Cowboy and the Lady"". Interestingly enough, ""Cowboy and the Lady"" were both scored by Alfred Newman, co-starred Brennan and Cooper, produced by Samuel Goldwyn, shot by Gregg Toland, and directed by William Wyler.So what we have here instead of a western in the classic sense is a re-make of ""Cowboy and the Lady"" with a slightly more menacing theme, but still a commitment to the comic side. And it fails. By 1940 the western was already getting its modern persona thanks to John Ford's ""Stagecoach"" (1939). But ""The Westerner"" falls more comfortably in the tradition of the films like ""The Virginian"" (1940) and ""The Outlaw"" (1943) which are really carryovers from the early 30s films, sans the singing cowboy.The ""climax"" of the film is as much a joke as the rest of the film. Brennan and Cooper  shoot it out in an empty theatre, hiding behind the furniture and taking wild shots at each other. By some miracle, one of Coopers bullets goes through and mortally wounds Brennan, although we never see any signs of blood or a wound. Then Cooper picks him up and carries him to see Lily herself. One fully expects to see Tim  Mix or William S Hart as the shot is so smaltzy it's almost unwatchable. Fortunately Brennan dies and the shot fades to black.If you compare ""The Westerner"" with films such as ""Stagecoach"" (1939), ""The Ox Bow Incident"" (1943), ""Red River"" (1948), and ""Fort Apache"" (1948) you'll see that ""The Westerner"" represents the end of an era and that the future western films took a different path.It's hard to recommend this film on any level. Toland's photography is probably its best feature, although given Toland's talents, this is far from his best effort.",2,Most Overrated Western,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",2010,4750,"['One', 'most', 'over-rated', 'westerns', 'first', 'part', '1940', 'film', 'almost', 'insufferable', 'bad', 'clich', 'eacute', 'can', 'think', 'such', 'dearth', 'action', 'pathetic', '10', 'second', 'fight', 'Cooper', 'double', 'actor', 'excitement', 'see', 'Cooper', 'Brennan', 'race', 'other', 'prize', 'best', 'mugging', 'front', 'camera', 'gang', 'undistinguishable', 'sidekicks', 'drinking', 'playing', 'cards.Doris', 'Davenport', 'up', 'brief', 'ai', ""n't"", 'just', 'too', 'cute', 'words', 'appearance', 'then', 'trounces', 'off', 'Cooper', 'desperate', 'facial', 'expressions', 'warn', 'not', 'last', 'time', ""'ll"", 'see', 'maiden', 'distress', 'Can', 'film', 'be', 'worse', 'course', 'can', 'not', 'such', 'sterling', 'cast', 'production', 'crew.After', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'was', 'great', 'actor', 'was', 'nominated', '4', 'times', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'won', '3', 'times', '1936', 'Come', 'Get', '1938', 'Kentucky', 'incredibly', 'film', 'Personally', 'think', 'did', 'even', 'better', 'films', 'such', 'Darling', 'Clementine', '1946', 'How', 'West', 'Was', 'Won', '1962', 'course', 'TV', 'series', 'Real', 'McCoys', '.Gary', 'Cooper', 'turned', 'great', 'performances', 'such', 'classics', 'High', 'Noon', '1952', 'Sergeant', 'York', '1941', '.So', 'what', 'went', 'wrong', 'Perhaps', 'William', 'Wyler', 'direction', 'Wyler', 'distinguished', 'career', 'Nominated', 'Best', 'Director', '12', 'times', 'won', '3', 'times', 'Mrs.', 'Miniver', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'Ben', 'Hur', 'none', 'nominations', 'were', 'westerns', 'genre', 'rarely', 'worked', 'similar', 'problem', 'cinematography', 'Greg', 'Toland', 'was', 'remarkable', 'photographer', 'responsible', 'films', 'such', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '1941', 'Grapes', 'Wrath', '1940', 'Dead', 'End', '1937', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'See', 'connection', 'Toland', 'also', 'rarely', 'worked', 'westerns', 'only', 'other', 'westerns', 'were', 'critically', 'disastrous', 'Outlaw', '1943', 'failed', 'dimensions', 'two', 'joke', 'here', 'very', 'forgettable', 'Cowboy', 'Lady', '1938', 'also', 'starred', 'Cooper', 'Brennan', 'was', 'modern', 'western', 'truth', 'not', 'much', 'western', 'all.Jo', 'Swirling', 'worked', 'films', 'GWTW', '1939', 'Blood', 'Sand', '1941', 'Wonderful', 'Life', '1946', 'was', 'only', 'western', 'co-writer', 'Niven', 'Bush', 'was', 'first', 'western', 'went', 'dabble', 'genre', 'Belle', 'Star', '1941', 'Duel', 'Sun', '1946', 'Man', 'Alamo', '1953', 'Co-writer', 'Stuart', 'Lake', 'was', 'basically', 'involved', 'writing', 'screenplays', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', '1934', '1939', '1946', '.Putting', 'aside', 'lack', 'background', 'western', 'genre', 'major', 'problem', 'film', 'character', 'development', 'Brennan', 'villain', 'piece', 'presented', 'more', 'clown', 'villain', 'Sure', 'bunch', 'thugs', 'hang', 'people', 'Brennan', 'usually', 'drunk', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'fooled', 'outwitted', 'such', 'crush', 'Lilly', 'Langtry', 'comical', 'Couple', 'comic', 'musical', 'score', 'accompanies', 'Brennan', 'get', 'impression', ""'re"", 'watching', 'Cowboy', 'Lady', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Cowboy', 'Lady', 'were', 'scored', 'Alfred', 'Newman', 'co-starred', 'Brennan', 'Cooper', 'produced', 'Samuel', 'Goldwyn', 'shot', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'directed', 'William', 'Wyler.So', 'what', 'have', 'here', 'instead', 'western', 'classic', 'sense', 're-make', 'Cowboy', 'Lady', 'slightly', 'more', 'menacing', 'theme', 'still', 'commitment', 'comic', 'side', '1940', 'western', 'was', 'already', 'getting', 'modern', 'persona', 'thanks', 'John', 'Ford', 'Stagecoach', '1939', 'Westerner', 'more', 'comfortably', 'tradition', 'films', 'Virginian', '1940', 'Outlaw', '1943', 'are', 'really', 'carryovers', 'early', '30s', 'films', 'singing', 'cowboy.The', 'climax', 'film', 'as', 'much', 'joke', 'rest', 'film', 'Brennan', 'Cooper', 'shoot', 'out', 'empty', 'theatre', 'hiding', 'furniture', 'taking', 'wild', 'shots', 'other', 'miracle', 'one', 'Coopers', 'bullets', 'mortally', 'wounds', 'Brennan', 'never', 'see', 'signs', 'blood', 'wound', 'Then', 'Cooper', 'up', 'see', 'Lily', 'One', 'fully', 'see', 'Tim', 'Mix', 'William', 'S', 'Hart', 'shot', 'so', 'smaltzy', 'almost', 'unwatchable', 'Fortunately', 'Brennan', 'dies', 'shot', 'fades', 'black.If', 'compare', 'Westerner', 'films', 'such', 'Stagecoach', '1939', 'Ox', 'Bow', 'Incident', '1943', 'Red', 'River', '1948', 'Fort', 'Apache', '1948', ""'ll"", 'see', 'Westerner', 'end', 'era', 'future', 'western', 'films', 'took', 'different', 'path.It', 'hard', 'recommend', 'film', 'level', 'Toland', 'photography', 'probably', 'best', 'feature', 'given', 'Toland', 'talents', 'far', 'best', 'effort']",N/A

447824,AT04V4H3AO3T5,6305082367,Jeremy W. Forstadt,"[5, 5]","One of the greatest of American directors, William Wyler is known for such classic films as MRS MINIVER, ROMAN HOLIDAY, and BEN-HUR. It is less well known that Wyler began his career directing a long list of cheap westerns for Universal Pictures in the 1920s. After establishing his reputation as a major film director in the 1930s (with such films as DEAD END, JEZEBEL, and WUTHERING HEIGHTS), Wyler returned to the western genre in 1940 intent on making the finest western to date. The successful result of this endeavor was THE WESTERNER.Gary Cooper stars as the smooth-talking drifter Cole Harden, and William Brennan plays a villainous, yet often likeable, Judge Roy Bean. Brennan's portrayal of Bean would deservedly win him his record third Oscar in a five-year span. Much of the film is focused on the relationship between Harden and Bean. Harden's manipulation of Bean is humorous and masterful as he manages to become the first accused man to avoid hanging in Bean's saloon/courthouse. Ultimately, the odd friendship that develops between the two men crashes: a result of Bean's unwavering support of the local cattle ranchers against the newly arrived homesteaders in a tragic range war which is tearing the county apart. In the end, Harden and Bean must meet in a classic showdown, but unlike most movie showdowns, we have sympathy for both characters.Walter Brennan is the true star of this picture in what has become the definitive portrayal of Judge Roy Bean. Bean is a real villain in this film, but Brennan makes him complex and likeable nonetheless. If it wasn't for his star power, Cooper should have received second billing in this movie, since the Bean role is clearly the dominant one. Brennan's solid reputation and identification as a character actor may have contributed to his relegation to a supporting role, but again, a supporting role in name only.Doris Davenport plays Jane Ellen Mathews, the lady farmer that Harden/Cooper falls for and takes up with against Judge Bean. The ensemble cast includes such notables as Chill Wills and Paul Hurst as well as Dana Andrews and Forrest Tucker in their first screen roles.

This was the fifth year the Supporting Player categories were being awarded by the Academy and Brennan won numbers one and three previously --- What makes the film even better is that it is based on a person who actually lived, which made the role even more challenging --- Walter Brennan carries this oater and transforms what would have otherwise been just another western into a classic.Under the production staff of:William Wyler  - DirectorSamuel Goldwyn  - ProducerNiven Busch  - ScreenwriterStuart N.

The conflict takes up a chapter in our school history books, The Homesteaders vs The Cattledrivers. We cannot keep but liking Judge Roy Bean, even at his diabolical best as played by Walter Brennan, and this reviewer is ""in love"" with Gary Cooper, in all of his radient splendor, so he can do no wrong as he plays our hero, Cole Harden. In this movie he is a ramblin' man who has the soul of a peacemaker.  He almost gets hanged, gets into several fist fights, as he tries to keep the cattle drivers from destroying the homesteaders, whom he has befriended.He has even developed a friendship with Judge Roy Bean, the hangin' judge who thinks he has an inside connection with his obsession, Lily Langtry. Acting inside of Acting--no one does this better than Gary Cooper, and I watched in rapt attention at his eyes, facial expressions, and little smiles as he plays Judge Roy Bean like a violyn.  He studies the old judge to craft his storylines--knowing just how far he can push it to fenagle Judge Roy in whatever direction he wants him to go in at the time.  I was disappointed when he borrowed the lock of hair from the girl (Doris Davenport).  I thought it cheap, but it was for a good cause and probably saved many lives, including his own.  There are a couple of surprise treats in this film.  There is a handsome young homesteader in this film who looks vaguely familiar.  It is Forrest Tucker as a young whippersnapper.  Likewise, there is a young and vile cattleman that is not too hard on the eyes either.  It is Chill Wills.  Neither had been shaving for very long.

447836,A16QODENBJVUI1,6305082367,Robert Moore,"[54, 54]","This is one of the most unusual and delightful Westerns ever made.  What sets it apart is the relative lack of action, the way that director William Wyler shifts most of the interest onto the relationship and interpersonal interplay between Cole Hardin (Gary Cooper, in one of his finest Western roles) and Judge Roy Bean (Walter Brennan).  The way the two move from instant enemies, to unexpected friends, to uneasy opponents, to reluctant enemies, and finally back to sympathetic friends is masterfully portrayed.  As fine as Cooper is, much of the credit lies with Brennan, who became the first person to win three acting Oscars by picking up his third Best Supporting Actor Oscar.  Unlike his other Oscar wins, this role was essentially a lead role.  Although many actors have portrayed Judge Roy Bean over the years, Brennan's is the definitive one, despite being the least historically accurate.  If his version isn't the most faithful, it is the most compelling.  He manages to be utterly absurd, dangerously unpredictable, and utterly likable at the same time.The story essentially falls into two halves.  The first involves Gary Cooper's accidental identification in Judge Bean's saloon as a horse thief, his trial and conviction, and clever manipulation of the Judge to gain a reprieve.  The second half concerns Cooper's taking sides in a range war, siding with a lone female farmer against cattlemen.  Both halves are brought together nicely in Cooper and Brennan's final struggle that ends the film.Along with Walter Brennan and Gary Cooper, the real star of this film is Gregg Toland, whose cinematography rivets the viewer's attention on the screen from beginning to end.  Toland, who died tragically young in 1948 at the age of 44, is universally regarded as one of the very greatest cinematographers of all time, and THE WESTERNER was one of his finest efforts in a very, very great streak of films over a relatively short period of time.  In the period running from 1939-41, Toland was responsible for filming such extraordinary classics as WUTHERING HEIGHTS, THE GRAPES OF WRATH, THE WESTERNER, and CITIZEN KANE.  Has any cinematographer ever had a two-year period matching this one?  I saw THE WESTERNER years before I knew who Gregg Toland was, but I long retained the memory of several of the amazing shots Toland framed.  He was a favorite of director William Wyler, who would employ him often during Toland's tragically short career.Toland's photography manages to give this film an epic feel and scope, while the tensions in the relationship between Cooper and Brennan make it a highly intimate film.  This is easily one of the most unique Westerns in the history of Holly, and one of the best.",5,A marvelous and strikingly unique Western,1051574400,"04 29, 2003",2003,2719,"['one', 'most', 'unusual', 'delightful', 'Westerns', 'ever', 'made', 'What', 'apart', 'relative', 'lack', 'action', 'way', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'most', 'interest', 'relationship', 'interpersonal', 'interplay', 'Cole', 'Hardin', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'one', 'finest', 'Western', 'roles', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'way', 'two', 'move', 'instant', 'enemies', 'unexpected', 'friends', 'uneasy', 'opponents', 'reluctant', 'enemies', 'finally', 'back', 'sympathetic', 'friends', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'As', 'fine', 'Cooper', 'much', 'credit', 'Brennan', 'who', 'became', 'first', 'person', 'win', 'three', 'acting', 'Oscars', 'picking', 'up', 'third', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'other', 'Oscar', 'wins', 'role', 'was', 'essentially', 'lead', 'role', 'many', 'actors', 'have', 'portrayed', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'years', 'Brennan', 'definitive', 'one', 'being', 'least', 'historically', 'accurate', 'version', ""n't"", 'most', 'faithful', 'most', 'compelling', 'be', 'utterly', 'absurd', 'dangerously', 'unpredictable', 'utterly', 'likable', 'same', 'time.The', 'story', 'essentially', 'two', 'halves', 'first', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'accidental', 'identification', 'Judge', 'Bean', 'saloon', 'horse', 'thief', 'trial', 'conviction', 'clever', 'manipulation', 'Judge', 'gain', 'reprieve', 'second', 'half', 'concerns', 'Cooper', 'taking', 'sides', 'range', 'war', 'siding', 'lone', 'female', 'farmer', 'cattlemen', 'halves', 'are', 'brought', 'together', 'nicely', 'Cooper', 'Brennan', 'final', 'struggle', 'film.Along', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'real', 'star', 'film', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'cinematography', 'viewer', 'attention', 'screen', 'beginning', 'end', 'Toland', 'who', 'died', 'tragically', 'young', '1948', 'age', '44', 'universally', 'regarded', 'one', 'very', 'greatest', 'cinematographers', 'time', 'THE', 'WESTERNER', 'was', 'one', 'finest', 'efforts', 'very', 'very', 'great', 'streak', 'films', 'relatively', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'period', 'running', '1939-41', 'Toland', 'was', 'responsible', 'filming', 'such', 'extraordinary', 'classics', 'WUTHERING', 'HEIGHTS', 'THE', 'GRAPES', 'OF', 'WRATH', 'THE', 'WESTERNER', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'Has', 'cinematographer', 'ever', 'had', 'two-year', 'period', 'matching', 'one', 'saw', 'THE', 'WESTERNER', 'years', 'knew', 'who', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'was', 'long', 'retained', 'memory', 'several', 'amazing', 'shots', 'Toland', 'framed', 'was', 'favorite', 'director', 'William', 'Wyler', 'who', 'would', 'employ', 'often', 'Toland', 'tragically', 'short', 'career.Toland', 'photography', 'give', 'film', 'epic', 'feel', 'scope', 'tensions', 'relationship', 'Cooper', 'Brennan', 'make', 'highly', 'intimate', 'film', 'easily', 'one', 'most', 'unique', 'Westerns', 'history', 'Holly', 'one', 'best']",N/A

He was known as a hanging judge and, early in the film, he determines, in his  court room-saloon to execute Cole [Gary Cooper] as a horse thief because he can't produce legal ownership papers.Before the hanging, however, there is the mandatory round of drinks.  Cole notices that the saloon is hanging with numerous pictures and mementoes of the actress Lily Langtree.  Over a final drink, he tells Bean that he has a hidden locket of Lily's hair.  The execution is immediately postponed until the acquisitive Bean can get the locket.Both Cooper and Brennan are terrific as they develp a complex and dangerous ""friendship.""  Cooper, who has no locket, gets one  from a local girl.  After much ""horse-trading"" Bean gets the locket and is transported with joy.Langtree shows up El Paso or San Antonio and nothing will keep Bean from going.  Resplendant in his old Confederate army uniform he goes to the  music hall.  Cole and Bean shoot it out and Bean is fatally hit.  Before he dies, however, he gets to visit the angelic Langtry. The dangerous Roy Bean is redeemed by his love for Lily.  We look through  his eyes as the image of Lily fades  out--forever.

They aren't gunslingers, or bounty hunters, or farmers, or ranchers...they just lived in the west during a time when all that romantic stuff was going on.  Now that doesn't mean neither of them could handle a gun, when necessary.  Nor that they wouldn't shoot a man dead, if they thought that was the thing to do.Walter Brennan spent most of his career playing sidekicks or secondary roles in movies that ""could"" have been made with somebody else in his role.  And maybe the part would have suffered - maybe not - but as long as the lead roles were well cast, the movie probably would have been as successful.But in this film Walter Brennan is in a primary role.  He plays Judge Roy Bean and he is at turns a wonderful whimsical drinking buddy and the next a ruthless, heartless taker of lives.  He is as sweet and naive as a young girl one minute and in a flash you see the fangs of a rattler emerge with a glimpse of cunning wiles and lethal results.And all that is in addition to seeing the great, larger than life Gary Cooper in one of his most endearing and thrilling roles.

Cooper plays a wandering cowpoke who runs afoul of Bean's kangaroo court, and gets accused of horsestealing (a hanging offense in most courts, but definitely in Judge Bean's horse thieves). The cowpoke gets off by convincing the judge he knows famous actress and  Lilly Langtry, who the judge desperately wants to meet. Cooper strings Bean along to keep himself out of trouble, but gets back into trouble when he sees that Bean and the townspeople are trying to run a group of homesteaders out of the country. Cooper decides to help the homesteaders, putting himself on a collision course with Bean.Brennan won one of three Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor for this film, and it's no mystery why he won. Both charming and contemptible, his Judge Roy Bean is quaintly naive and corruptibly sinster. His interaction with Cooper throughout the film is masterful in its complexity and psychology. Cooper is his usually solid, quiet hero who says a lot with few words. Backed by solid Western supporting stars like Chill Wills and Forrest Tucker, ""The Westerner"" is a wonderful Western, and great to see it rereleased on DVD.",5,Classic Cooper/Brennan Western,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1545,"['Take', 'real', 'life', 'Western', 'character', 'notorious', 'Western', 'judge', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'add', 'one', 'genre', 'sturdiest', 'heroes', 'Gary', 'Cooper', 'have', 'makings', 'Western', 'movie', 'classic', 'Westerner', 'starring', 'Cooper', 'good', 'friend', 'frequent', 'co-star', 'Walter', 'Brennan', 'Judge', 'Bean', 'what', 'Hollywood', 'so', 'well', 'take', 'pinch', 'truth', 'heap', 'fiction', 'mixes', 'pleasing', 'theatrical', 'stew', 'Cooper', 'wandering', 'cowpoke', 'who', 'afoul', 'Bean', 'kangaroo', 'court', 'accused', 'horsestealing', 'hanging', 'offense', 'most', 'courts', 'definitely', 'Judge', 'Bean', 'horse', 'thieves', 'cowpoke', 'off', 'convincing', 'judge', 'famous', 'actress', 'Lilly', 'Langtry', 'who', 'judge', 'desperately', 'meet', 'Cooper', 'strings', 'Bean', 'keep', 'trouble', 'back', 'trouble', 'when', 'Bean', 'townspeople', 'are', 'trying', 'run', 'group', 'homesteaders', 'country', 'Cooper', 'help', 'homesteaders', 'putting', 'collision', 'course', 'Bean.Brennan', 'won', 'one', 'three', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'film', 'mystery', 'why', 'won', 'charming', 'contemptible', 'Judge', 'Roy', 'Bean', 'quaintly', 'naive', 'corruptibly', 'sinster', 'interaction', 'Cooper', 'film', 'masterful', 'complexity', 'psychology', 'Cooper', 'usually', 'solid', 'quiet', 'hero', 'who', 'lot', 'few', 'words', 'Backed', 'solid', 'Western', 'supporting', 'stars', 'Chill', 'Wills', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'Westerner', 'wonderful', 'Western', 'great', 'see', 'rereleased', 'DVD']",N/A
