I absolutely loved the main character Tara who was psychotic yet sexy at the same time. The film while confusing at times i.e the flashback rape scene or why she has sex with the doctor is still very enjoyable and i found myself enjoying it more and more with every twisted thing she would do. In my opinion, this film is great and does not deserve all the bad reviews it has gotten. In closing, She's crushed is nothing original but its still worth checking out. Highly recommended!

I see this as the Fatal Attraction meets any bloody torture porn and that's not a bad thing. I love the way this woman can get away with almost anything just by the mere fact that she is female. I think this is a great angle for a horror film and I for one felt pretty bad for Tara's new lover. Tara is the main character of the movie and is played by Natalie Dickinson who knocks her role out of the ball park.

1298112,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B002XOTBB0,Compay,"[21, 29]","Update: Thank you to those who just rated this review helpful.  It's disappointing that an honest review got me so many ""unhelpful"" votes by people involved with this movie.Unfortunately, this movie was a big disappointment on many levels.  The real problem with Crushed is that it's incredibly unoriginal, and contains a number of elements cobbled together from different thrillers.The film's main concept borrows from the Academy Award nominated movie Fatal Attraction.  The movie's use of music is virtually identical to scenes in Oldboy, where Waltz music becomes the backdrop of several disturbing scenes.  When Tara the psychopath gives one victim a homemade lobotomy before feeding him at the dinner table, you instantly recognize that the scene was lifted from Silence of the Lambs sequel Hannibal.The acting in the movie is also disappointing.  Henrik Norlen, as sort of a poor man's Peter Sarsgaard, seems miscast as an American combat vet with a slight Swedish accent.  Natalie Dickinson does an absolutely awful job as Tara, the obsessed admirer.  The only actor with any real screen presence is Keith Malley, playing the wisecracking co-worker and buddy of our protagonist.  Not coincidentally, Malley happens to be a comedian with a successful online show, and in his debut screen appearance he steals every scene that he's in.The only thing that distinguishes this film from others are the scenes of torture and gratuitous violence.  If the producers had hoped to attract fans of Hostel, they're going to be disappointed.  The only reason why I gave the film two stars instead of one was because of the comic relief of Keith Malley as Donnie.  Otherwise, I'd hardly consider this movie even worth a rental.[2/16/10 update: Two five-star reviews (both first time reviews) state that the movie ""shook them to their core"" (exact wording in both).  Every five-star review up now is also by people with only one review.

1298122,A3DV7AKNM4N8TN,B002XOTBB0,Stuart Conover,"[0, 0]","Written and directed by Patrick Johnson this is Patrick's second film to reach a wide audience. The first of which was released in 2005 and entitled SideFX. I haven't seen his original film though it sounds like a zombie-ish themed film involving sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Anyone going the zombie route always gets a plus in my book though I'm not here to talk about the undead but about a pyscho stalker film.On a personal note one of my ex-girlfriends did not want to accept a break up and did carry a picture of me around with her that she would put up at tables she was sitting at. With this in mind, She's Crushed really struck home as a movie that creeped me out since while she was not as insane as the lead in this film I'm sure if her life had been slightly more traumatic or she slightly more crazy at the time something like this would not have been all of that farfetched for me to deal with. That thought scares the hell out of me!The lead in this film is played by Tara (Natalie Dickinson) and I have to say that I REALLY want to see her get some rolls in a few larger films (aside from the two that are in progress from Patrick Johnson) in a role where she gets to show off her chops again at insanity because she makes it work. The movie itself missed it's mark at being a great film though the character of Tara makes you want to just see where she is going to go. The apparent product of rape and abuse she doesn't go the route of revenge in ""I Spit On Your Grave"" but instead decided to emulate those who have abused her using a large amount of sex, stalking, obsession, and violence to get exactly what she wants. On top of this her mother is nearly one of the walking dead herself from how badly she is messed up as shown by her brief visits in the psyche ward that she is staying at and on top of this we also find out she is having sex with either her father or step-father.Early in the film we are introduced to Ray who is supposed to be the main character (even though he is by and large outshined by Tara) and helps her move some luggage. Soon after she sees him drunk and initiates a one night stand. There is only one major problem, Ray has a girlfriend. Instantly she is smitten and develops a crush on Ray and decides that the only way for life to work out is for Ray to be with her. She kills, tortures, lobotomizes, and uses sex to attempt to drive Ray away from the woman that he wants to marry. The amount of twisted torture is shocking on how she is able to pull it off.This is not a movie to expect a revolutionary horror film or franchise off of (even though it is easily left off for a sequel.) It is though a film that is great to kill some time with on either the weekend or a late night showing.

The first thing we notice is that Tara has some severe psychological issues. After Ray gets drunk, Tara takes him home...her home. Ray breaks the first rule of sex: ""Never sleep with anyone crazier than yourself.""Tara's actions are way over the top and could be described as darkly comical. There are ""Taraiscrushed"" interview videos on ""You Tube"" that provides background information for Tara. It is recommended that you watch them before seeing the film...although few people have watched them. They should have made them a bonus feature on the DVD.

There is plenty of blood and gore, but I has more amused than horrified.F-bomb, sex, nudity, rape, Natalie Dickinson in a short skirt with frequent up skirt camera angles.",4,I LOVE YOU BOO-BOO BEAR,1333670400,"04 6, 2012",2012,1094,"['When', 'first', 'see', 'Tara', 'Wood', 'Natalie', 'Dickinson', 'moving', 'next', 'door', 'bare', 'footed', 'heavy', 'baggage', 'eye', 'Ray', 'Henrik', 'Norl', 'eacute', 'insurance', 'adjustor', 'who', 'reason', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'girlfriend', 'Maddy', 'Caitlin', 'Wehrle', 'commitment', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'Tara', 'severe', 'psychological', 'issues', 'Ray', 'drunk', 'Tara', 'home', 'home', 'Ray', 'first', 'rule', 'sex', 'Never', 'sleep', 'anyone', 'crazier', 'Tara', 'actions', 'are', 'way', 'top', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'darkly', 'comical', 'are', 'Taraiscrushed', 'interview', 'videos', 'Tube', 'background', 'information', 'Tara', 'recommended', 'watch', 'seeing', 'film', 'few', 'people', 'have', 'watched', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'bonus', 'feature', 'DVD', 'enjoyed', 'Tara', 'Wood', 'character', 'played', 'Natalie', 'plenty', 'blood', 'gore', 'more', 'amused', 'horrified.F-bomb', 'sex', 'nudity', 'rape', 'Natalie', 'Dickinson', 'short', 'skirt', 'frequent', 'up', 'skirt', 'camera', 'angles']",N/A

In THIS case, however, it was clear by the early middle of it, that this piece of slasher garbage was going to have ZERO redeeming qualities.  i took it out of my player and donated it it to GoodWill Industries.  How movies as bad as this can ever be financed and produced is a mystery i am destined to be forever in the dark about.Rated PG  for POINTLESS Gore.",1,"Movie: ""Crushed""""",1372204800,"06 26, 2013",2013,559,"['VERY', 'few', 'movies', 'are', 'so', 'bad', 'i', 'will', 'not', 'watch', 'way', 'end', 'see', 'might', 'be', 'justification', 'vindication', 'how', 'terrible', 'earlier', 'parts', 'movie', 'can', 'sometimes', 'be', 'THIS', 'case', 'however', 'was', 'clear', 'early', 'middle', 'piece', 'slasher', 'garbage', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'ZERO', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'i', 'took', 'player', 'donated', 'GoodWill', 'Industries', 'How', 'movies', 'as', 'bad', 'can', 'ever', 'be', 'financed', 'produced', 'mystery', 'i', 'am', 'destined', 'be', 'forever', 'dark', 'about.Rated', 'PG', 'POINTLESS', 'Gore']",N/A
