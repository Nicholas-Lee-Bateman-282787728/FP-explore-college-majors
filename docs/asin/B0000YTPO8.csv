So I rented it and put up 2.75 hoping they would be wrong.  I wasn't disappointed.  I enjoyed this movie.  I could see some similarities between this one and the first one.  In the sequel, a girl name Whittier gets fed up with the squad she's in and decides to make her own, which in the end, ends up outcheering the varsity squad to go on.  The ending is the best part.  That's where all the good cheerleading moves are made.  I do think the first one was better, but this one was watchable.  I was also pleased to find a section full of DVD extras (A lot of DVD's have been skimpy in this section lately) They include a behind the scenes, a music video that contains little bubbles with facts about the movie (think pop-up video), the dos and don'ts of cheerleading with the movie's choreographer, a sing-along with the original cast of Bring It On, a trailer, and deleted/alternate scenes.

That's when a cheer war begins to decide which team should go to represent the college at nationals.This movie has no spunk, spirit, and charm that ""Bring It On"" had.

Although a sequel, it is more like a really painful blend of ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Cadet Kelly"".Despite the warnings I actually watched my soon to be re-gifted DVD. Anne Judson-Yager (who looks like Reese Witherspoon plus 30 pounds) plays new college freshman and aspiring cheerleader Whittier Smith. She and her friend Monica (Faune A. Chambers) pass the audition and come under the scrutiny of sadistic head cheerleader Tina Hammersmith (Bree Turner). They soon tire of life under Tina and form a rival cheerleading squad of fine arts students and campus radicals. Despite a host of available movie stereotypes the screenwriter can't seem to figure out how to portray this crowd and you actually feel embarrassed for the actors who must deal with these portions of her script. Production design, style, and unity are apparently unknown elements to director Damon Santostefano (unsuccessfully seeking work since making this movie) and the whole thing seems randomly thrown together. It must have been an assembly nightmare for the editor, who may or may not share some of the blame-it's hard to tell.I'm at somewhat of a loss as to the target demographic for ""Bring It On Again"". These things tend to be pitched to producers for their sexploitation potential. And in this case they could at least count on a pre-sold sexploitation audience of original ""Bring It On"" fans. But the only tie with the original is the subject of cheerleading and those looking for sexploitation elements will be disappointed.My guess is that the target audience is actually preteen girls. The script is certainly on that age and sophistication level. The male members of the cast appear to have been selected for their looks (certainly not their acting skills) while the female members are a dreary looking bunch (although their limited acting skills are well-matched with those of the male cast). When your leading lady looks like Judson-Yager and your only really pretty actress is cast as the cheer squad's towel girl; alarm bells should start sounding for those outside this target demographic. I bet the producers wish that they had heard those bells and monitored this project a little closer.Then again, what do I know?

789905,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000YTPO8,Tsuyoshi,"[2, 8]","To be fair, the sequel to 'Bring it on' is not as bad as you think.  As far as cheerleading contest sequence goes, the cast and crew did homework, even though the fresh surpise of watching the final showdown of the original is missing.  But I think the number of the flooding negative reviews should be justified after all, for 'Bring it on Again' falls short of almost everything that the original had.So what is wrong with the film?  See, for starters, it has no joyful musical sequence that started the original, with 'I'm Sexy, I'm Cute, and Popular to Boot.'  Instead, you see the unfuny and misguided opening, in which Whittier the heroine of the fim tormented by ... er ... yellow custard or something thrown into the face.  Now, that is a bad sign.The story is set in Cal State Col, which is not a bad idea.  This time, Tina, the popular leader of cheerleading squad turns out a mean villain, who demands that Whittier should desert her best friend and her possible boyfriend, too.  Then Whittier enlists the help of 'loser' on the campus (like modern dancer wannabes), to make another team, which leads to the final competition.All right.  The rather familiar portraits of college life can be forgiven, because what we want is lively and likable characters we can relate to.  Unfortunately, the film misses every chance to make them so, or to be funny itself, mainly because of the banal direction that lacks the confidence of 'Bring it on.'  In fact, original 'Bring it on' unashamedly took advantage of the young and sexy images of the girls, as is seen most notably in 'Car Wash' scenes.  This kind of vivacious and audacious energy is not to be found here.And the original had a great cast including Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, and Gabrielle Union.  With the unknown, but still not-so-bad cast (who did really a good job), the sequel could be better, but not with this timid attitudes.",2,"Better Than Expected, But Needs More Charms and Energy",1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,1899,"['be', 'fair', 'sequel', ""'Bring"", 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'As', 'far', 'cheerleading', 'contest', 'sequence', 'cast', 'crew', 'did', 'homework', 'even', 'fresh', 'surpise', 'watching', 'final', 'showdown', 'original', 'missing', 'think', 'number', 'flooding', 'negative', 'reviews', 'should', 'be', 'justified', ""'Bring"", 'Again', 'falls', 'short', 'almost', 'everything', 'original', 'had.So', 'what', 'wrong', 'film', 'See', 'starters', 'joyful', 'musical', 'sequence', 'started', 'original', ""'m"", 'Sexy', ""'m"", 'Cute', 'Popular', 'Boot', 'Instead', 'see', 'unfuny', 'misguided', 'opening', 'Whittier', 'heroine', 'fim', 'tormented', 'er', 'yellow', 'custard', 'something', 'thrown', 'face', 'Now', 'bad', 'sign.The', 'story', 'set', 'Cal', 'State', 'Col', 'not', 'bad', 'idea', 'time', 'Tina', 'popular', 'leader', 'cheerleading', 'squad', 'out', 'mean', 'villain', 'who', 'Whittier', 'should', 'desert', 'best', 'friend', 'possible', 'boyfriend', 'too', 'Then', 'Whittier', 'help', ""'loser"", 'campus', 'modern', 'dancer', 'wannabes', 'make', 'team', 'final', 'competition.All', 'right', 'rather', 'familiar', 'portraits', 'college', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'forgiven', 'what', 'want', 'lively', 'likable', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'chance', 'make', 'so', 'be', 'funny', 'mainly', 'banal', 'direction', 'confidence', ""'Bring"", 'fact', 'original', ""'Bring"", 'unashamedly', 'took', 'advantage', 'young', 'sexy', 'images', 'girls', 'seen', 'most', 'notably', ""'Car"", 'Wash', 'scenes', 'kind', 'vivacious', 'audacious', 'energy', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'original', 'had', 'great', 'cast', 'including', 'Kirsten', 'Dunst', 'Eliza', 'Dushku', 'Gabrielle', 'Union', 'unknown', 'still', 'not-so-bad', 'cast', 'who', 'did', 'really', 'good', 'job', 'sequel', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'not', 'timid', 'attitudes']",Bring It On Again
