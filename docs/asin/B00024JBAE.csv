824432,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00024JBAE,Grady Harp,"[11, 13]","If you like to become so involved in a film that you feel as though you are inside the minds of the actors and the writer and the atmosphere of a film, then MY FATHER AND I is definitely a classic film to treasure.  On the other hand, if you favor stories that are linear and clear with a start and an undisputed finish that brings assured closure, then this film will be frustrating. Anne Fontaine has gathered an accomplished cast of French actors and directed them in a mind excursion that asks as many questions as it answers: are we observing  a family out of sync and falling into disrepair before our eyes, or are we privy to the instant mental response to a letter that triggers a life in a flashing moment that is resolved by psychological hypothesis?  It is this kind of storytelling that the French do so well, and in this reviewer's opinion this is one of the finest films to challenge our minds that has come along in years.Jean-Luc (impeccably portrayed by the exquisite Charles Berling) is a wealthy physician whose practice in Versailles caters to the aging wealthy, a clientele who see him as a god with his Human Growth Hormone injections, Botox treatment, and other battlements against aging (Gerontology, his specialty).  He is married to a phenomenally beautiful wealthy wife (Natacha Regnier, as beautiful as she is talented), lives in a magnificent home, uses his younger brother as his aide/chauffeur allowing that brother to pursue his dreams of being a standup comedian, and maintains a mistress on the side.  His marriage is childless: his wife depends on her husband to be her doctor and has been informed that for her health she should not have the children she yearns to bear. As the story opens, Jean-Luc is readying himself for a party honoring him for his contributions to the town, a party of great elegance given in his own home.  As he prepares to dress he notices a letter announcing that his father has died. Pregnant pause....  At the party that commences his father appears and gradually we discover that the father Maurice (played with great subtlety and nuance by Michele Bouquet) and his sons have not seen each other for many years: the disillusioned Maurice left his family when his two sons were very young to go off to Africa to treat the indigenous population - a physician to the poor in contrast to Jean-Luc's physician to the wealthy.  This history has profoundly affected Jean-Luc who avoids intimacy with his wife, does not want children to remind him of the childhood he remembers with loathing for his deserting father, and in many ways has brought him to a life that mimics that of the very father that he no longer knows.  Maurice ingratiates himself into staying with Jean-Luc and his wife, gently alludes to the fact that after leaving Africa following one of the many government overthrows he is without pension or support, and gently requests support form his wealthy son.  Maurice befriends Jean-Luc's wife, attempts reconnection with the other son, and finally has a confrontation with Jean-Luc over the differences (and very real similarities) between their life choices.  At this point a significant scene brings closure to the tale and we are returned to the image of Jean-Luc reading the letter that initiated  the pregnant pause at the beginning of the film.  It is up to us, the viewer to decide if we have observed fact, or if we have entered the imaginative brain of Jean-Luc reacting to a letter.  This is movie making at its finest.  The direction is brilliant, tense, revelatory, and kaleidoscopic. The acting is so very fine that it defies description.  An outstanding movie visually, psychologically, and technically.  Highly Recommended.",5,"Fascinatingly bold, provocative view of Dysfunctional Family",1095984000,"09 24, 2004",2004,3714,"['like', 'become', 'so', 'involved', 'film', 'feel', 'are', 'minds', 'actors', 'writer', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'then', 'MY', 'FATHER', 'AND', 'definitely', 'classic', 'film', 'treasure', 'other', 'hand', 'favor', 'stories', 'are', 'linear', 'clear', 'start', 'undisputed', 'finish', 'assured', 'closure', 'then', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'frustrating', 'Anne', 'Fontaine', 'gathered', 'accomplished', 'cast', 'French', 'actors', 'directed', 'mind', 'excursion', 'many', 'questions', 'are', 'observing', 'family', 'sync', 'falling', 'disrepair', 'eyes', 'are', 'privy', 'instant', 'mental', 'response', 'letter', 'life', 'flashing', 'moment', 'resolved', 'psychological', 'hypothesis', 'kind', 'storytelling', 'French', 'do', 'so', 'well', 'reviewer', 'opinion', 'one', 'finest', 'films', 'challenge', 'minds', 'come', 'years.Jean-Luc', 'impeccably', 'portrayed', 'exquisite', 'Charles', 'Berling', 'wealthy', 'physician', 'practice', 'Versailles', 'caters', 'aging', 'wealthy', 'clientele', 'who', 'see', 'god', 'Human', 'Growth', 'Hormone', 'injections', 'Botox', 'treatment', 'other', 'battlements', 'aging', 'Gerontology', 'specialty', 'married', 'phenomenally', 'beautiful', 'wealthy', 'wife', 'Natacha', 'Regnier', 'as', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'magnificent', 'home', 'younger', 'brother', 'aide/chauffeur', 'allowing', 'brother', 'pursue', 'dreams', 'being', 'standup', 'comedian', 'mistress', 'side', 'marriage', 'childless', 'wife', 'husband', 'be', 'doctor', 'been', 'informed', 'health', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'children', 'bear', 'story', 'Jean-Luc', 'readying', 'party', 'honoring', 'contributions', 'town', 'party', 'great', 'elegance', 'given', 'own', 'home', 'dress', 'letter', 'announcing', 'father', 'died', 'Pregnant', 'pause', 'party', 'father', 'gradually', 'discover', 'father', 'Maurice', 'played', 'great', 'subtlety', 'nuance', 'Michele', 'Bouquet', 'sons', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'other', 'many', 'years', 'disillusioned', 'Maurice', 'left', 'family', 'when', 'two', 'sons', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'go', 'off', 'Africa', 'treat', 'indigenous', 'population', 'physician', 'poor', 'contrast', 'Jean-Luc', 'physician', 'wealthy', 'history', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'Jean-Luc', 'who', 'intimacy', 'wife', 'not', 'want', 'children', 'remind', 'childhood', 'loathing', 'deserting', 'father', 'many', 'ways', 'brought', 'life', 'very', 'father', 'no', 'longer', 'Maurice', 'staying', 'Jean-Luc', 'wife', 'gently', 'fact', 'leaving', 'Africa', 'following', 'one', 'many', 'government', 'overthrows', 'pension', 'support', 'gently', 'requests', 'support', 'form', 'wealthy', 'son', 'Maurice', 'Jean-Luc', 'wife', 'reconnection', 'other', 'son', 'finally', 'confrontation', 'Jean-Luc', 'differences', 'very', 'real', 'similarities', 'life', 'choices', 'point', 'significant', 'scene', 'closure', 'tale', 'are', 'returned', 'image', 'Jean-Luc', 'reading', 'letter', 'initiated', 'pregnant', 'pause', 'beginning', 'film', 'viewer', 'decide', 'have', 'observed', 'fact', 'have', 'entered', 'imaginative', 'brain', 'Jean-Luc', 'reacting', 'letter', 'movie', 'making', 'finest', 'direction', 'brilliant', 'tense', 'revelatory', 'kaleidoscopic', 'acting', 'so', 'very', 'fine', 'description', 'outstanding', 'movie', 'visually', 'psychologically', 'technically', 'Highly', 'Recommended']",My Father and I
824433,A20CR4907G7CTS,B00024JBAE,Jeff Marzano,"[0, 0]",This is a well acted drama with a few surprises here and there.It gets into the types of issues that can arise between father and son when things don't go perfectly in life.  This can cause very deep and sometimes repressed anger which it does in this case.  The re-appearance of the father after many years causes those feelings to surface in a somewhat comical way at the end.We find out that those repressed feelings have affected the main character and caused him to be less than truthful with those around him.  As another reviewer said he had ironically become like his father in some ways.The brother is a stand up comic but then sometimes you see him in the movie saying things by himself with no audience there.  It's like he's narrating the story at times.  This adds to the rather unusual atmosphere of the movie.Based on his comedy routine he better keep his day job as his doctor brother's chauffeur.There's not much sexual action in this movie.  Rather the occasional sexually suggestive scenes only reinforce the main theme of the movie which is people who have become cold and distant.After reading some of the other reviews I'm not sure that I really understood the ending.  I guess it's one of those movies where you're not quite sure what really happened.The dvd I rented was in French with English subtitles.Jeff MarzanoDamage,4,Unusual Movie,1206662400,"03 28, 2008",2008,1346,"['well', 'acted', 'drama', 'few', 'surprises', 'here', 'there.It', 'types', 'issues', 'can', 'arise', 'father', 'son', 'when', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'go', 'perfectly', 'life', 'can', 'cause', 'very', 'deep', 'sometimes', 'repressed', 'anger', 'case', 're-appearance', 'father', 'many', 'years', 'feelings', 'surface', 'somewhat', 'comical', 'way', 'end.We', 'find', 'out', 'repressed', 'feelings', 'have', 'affected', 'main', 'character', 'caused', 'be', 'less', 'truthful', 'reviewer', 'said', 'had', 'ironically', 'become', 'father', 'ways.The', 'brother', 'stand', 'up', 'comic', 'then', 'sometimes', 'see', 'movie', 'saying', 'things', 'audience', 'there', 'narrating', 'story', 'times', 'rather', 'unusual', 'atmosphere', 'movie.Based', 'comedy', 'routine', 'better', 'keep', 'day', 'job', 'doctor', 'brother', 'chauffeur.There', 'not', 'much', 'sexual', 'action', 'movie', 'occasional', 'sexually', 'suggestive', 'scenes', 'only', 'reinforce', 'main', 'theme', 'movie', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'cold', 'distant.After', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'really', 'understood', 'ending', 'guess', 'one', 'movies', 'where', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'really', 'happened.The', 'dvd', 'rented', 'was', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles.Jeff', 'MarzanoDamage']",My Father and I

824435,A14GK0E64J0WAS,B00024JBAE,Paul Allaer,"[0, 0]","I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and stumbled upon this. After reading the DVD jacket, I decided to give this a try. Am I glad I did!""My Father and I"" (2000 release from France; 100 min.) brings the story of Jean-Luc (played by Charles Berling), a doctor who is being honored by the city of Versailles for his contributions to the community. We learn later that Jean-Luc runs a successful clinic, targeted to the rich. At the event honoring Jean-Luc, an older gentleman apeears out of the blue, and we learn soon that this is Maurice (played by the legendary Michel Bouquet), Jean-Luc's long lost father who took off 20 years ago to run a clinic somewhere in Africa. We also meet Jean-Luc's wife Isa (played by Natacha R&eacute;gnier), who takes an immediate liking to Maurice. And finally we meet down-on-his-luck Patrick (played by St&eacute;phane Guillon), Jean-Luc's younger brother and his chauffeur. It doesn't take long before Jean-Luc starts (and hence we start) to question why his dad shows up after all these years, and what does his dad really want? It also becomes clear that the marriage of Jean-Luc and Isa isn't all what it appears to be at first glance. To tell you much more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.This movie is a slowburner, and I mean that in the best possible way. There is little to no action to speak off, just the camera observing people interacting with each other, yet somehow it felt to me like something very bad could be happening at any time (I'm not going to say whether it does or doesn't). Michel Bouquet's performance is nothing short of outstanding. This movie is beautifully directed by Anne Fountaine. By coincidence, I saw her most recent movie ""Two Mothers"" (starring Naomi Watts) last month while in Europe (it isn't out yet in the US), and sadly it is one of the worst I've seen in a long time, if you can believe it.

What he cannot or never gave of himseslf to his own family, he somehow is able to share with strangers in a faraway land.

As the movie progresses, we learn that the doctor's wife is starving for affection , children and a more fulfilling life, while he keeps everyone at arms' length and emotionally distant.
