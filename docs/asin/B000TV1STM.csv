This is a great DVD and I have loved and enjoyed watching it over and over again. It is inspiring music and makes me want to learn more on the guitar. I doubt I'll ever achieve the musical genius of Vai, but I can always aspire for it. It's nice to see someone so mature and great on the guitar!

1092338,AW1493ZQTQ2ET,B000TV1STM,Irfan A. Alvi,"[0, 1]","Steve Vai is one of the greatest guitarists alive today, and this excellent DVD shows that he's not just a (progressive) rocker.In the first part of this performance, we see that he's able to successfully integrate his signature guitar playing with an orchestra (in Holland, maybe this sort of thing couldn't happen in the US?).Then in the second part of the performance the orchestra plays one of Steve's commissioned compositions, and I was delighted to find that he's an excellent composer in this setting.  Yes, his signature style is there, but it's not just a rock composition imposed on an orchestra.  Steve clearly understands 'the orchestra as multidimensional instrument' and uses it effectively to create something which sounds fresh and unique.  I also had to laugh at the level of technical challenge the composition surely must have presented for some of the musicians.  :-)Goes without say that this one is highly recommended.",5,Masterful and pioneering,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,941,"['Steve', 'Vai', 'one', 'greatest', 'guitarists', 'alive', 'today', 'excellent', 'DVD', 'not', 'just', 'progressive', 'rocker.In', 'first', 'part', 'performance', 'see', 'able', 'successfully', 'integrate', 'signature', 'guitar', 'playing', 'orchestra', 'Holland', 'maybe', 'sort', 'thing', 'could', ""n't"", 'happen', 'US', '.Then', 'second', 'part', 'performance', 'orchestra', 'one', 'Steve', 'commissioned', 'compositions', 'was', 'delighted', 'find', 'excellent', 'composer', 'setting', 'Yes', 'signature', 'style', 'there', 'not', 'just', 'rock', 'composition', 'imposed', 'orchestra', 'Steve', 'clearly', ""'the"", 'orchestra', 'multidimensional', 'instrument', 'effectively', 'create', 'something', 'fresh', 'unique', 'also', 'had', 'laugh', 'level', 'technical', 'challenge', 'composition', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'presented', 'musicians', 'say', 'one', 'highly', 'recommended']",Visual Sound Theories
1092339,ATPOD87Y2WKZ4,B000TV1STM,"Mario A. Lopez ""Mayo""","[7, 10]","Steve is one of the most creative and gifted rock guitar players of this time but you have to recognize when a project doesn't fit your style and type of music. Perhaps Steve's intention was the same that took Inwie to start a project with a Japanese symphonic orchestra (that, by the way, does a great job) for his Concerto Suite for Electric Guitar and Orchestra. Well, that was a good fit for Malmsteen, but for Vai, in my opinion, didn't work. The orchestration of a song written originally for a rock band is not an easy task. There is a balance between the soloist and the supporting instruments in turn that has to be worked to get a harmonic result. Even with the virtuosity of Vai, the mix sounds poor, sometimes empty, and the climax of some songs sound like they didn't spend enough time rehearsing, working on a more refined orchestration, or all of the above. To see Vai in action is always a treat and doesn't hurt to pay for this DVD, but my expectations were higher of what I saw and listened.",3,"For some rock guitar players orchestration works... for Steve, it didn't",1228953600,"12 11, 2008",2008,1009,"['Steve', 'one', 'most', 'creative', 'gifted', 'rock', 'guitar', 'players', 'time', 'have', 'recognize', 'when', 'project', ""n't"", 'fit', 'style', 'type', 'music', 'Perhaps', 'Steve', 'intention', 'was', 'same', 'took', 'Inwie', 'start', 'project', 'Japanese', 'symphonic', 'orchestra', 'way', 'great', 'job', 'Concerto', 'Suite', 'Electric', 'Guitar', 'Orchestra', 'Well', 'was', 'good', 'fit', 'Malmsteen', 'Vai', 'opinion', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'orchestration', 'song', 'written', 'originally', 'rock', 'band', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'balance', 'soloist', 'supporting', 'instruments', 'turn', 'be', 'worked', 'get', 'harmonic', 'result', 'Even', 'virtuosity', 'Vai', 'mix', 'poor', 'sometimes', 'empty', 'climax', 'songs', 'sound', 'did', ""n't"", 'spend', 'enough', 'time', 'rehearsing', 'working', 'more', 'refined', 'orchestration', 'above', 'see', 'Vai', 'action', 'always', 'treat', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'pay', 'DVD', 'expectations', 'were', 'higher', 'what', 'saw', 'listened']",Visual Sound Theories

This shows the scope of the man that I knew was always there and was hoping to one day see. He plays his instrument with all the precision of a concert violinist. Its wonderful to see the man in this element. I hope this is the beginning of more things to come. He even says ""by hook or by crook"", and I believe him. Get this for the aspiring guitarist at your house.
