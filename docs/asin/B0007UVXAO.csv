Hernandez ""fromthewoods""","[6, 17]","The latest fad it seems in Japanese anime is the big busted light haired goddess-like super human that loves to show off her body (Tenjo Tenge, Gravion, Goh Dannar, UFO UltraMaiden Valkyrie,.. on and on and on...)  In the uncut Japanese version (all 12 episodes) there seems to always be a hot spring close by that she inevitibly is taking a bath in... of course totally nude!And the most irritating thing for this viewer is the insistance upon white women with overly large busts or 'non-japanese people', being the really evil characters. Is this is truly a Japanese ideal... maybe some left over super raging hormone condition of the creators of this stuff???Maybe I am just  crabby!  But I personally think Grenadier is nothing but fan service fan service fan service,.. and a very poor quality job of it at that and a rip-off of the Kenshin-style scenario.

Huh, wait, is this an Italian Western or a Japanese Samurai Epic?Grenadier is about a female shootist who believes a smile is the best weapon but still packs a 38 six-shooter with all the chambers loaded.  Tisk, tisk - rule number one of the gun fighter was always leave the chamber under the hammer empty.But this is fantasy, so who cares?Machine guns, power suits, antigravity.  You get the picture.  Don't take anything seriously in this anime.  On the other hand Wendee Lee is the English voice for Rushuna.  What surprised me is I didn't know that till I saw the ending credits.  Hey, she has played many female roles, a few male roles and even a turtle.  So her ability to create a new voice isn't a shocker.  She is also the English writer and voice director so you know the translation is going to be good.  Her takes pride in her work.  In other words it was a nice surprise.Too bad the original material is so flawed.  Sorry, but there was too much fan service for me, the art work isn't that great, the gun battles lack energy and the plot failed to hook me.  And there is only four episodes on the first disc.Now, there is lots of extras in the form of Japanese commentary for each episode and even the pre-broadcasting special, but that can't make up for all the faults.  I would give it only a three out of five but I happen to be a fan of Wendee Lee, so it keeps a point.",4,"A season to smile, a season to kill...",1158796800,"09 21, 2006",2006,1488,"['Japan', 'time', 'war', 'time', 'when', 'man', 'gun', 'could', 'always', 'find', 'work', 'life', 'was', 'cheap', 'Huh', 'wait', 'Italian', 'Western', 'Japanese', 'Samurai', 'Epic', 'Grenadier', 'female', 'shootist', 'who', 'smile', 'best', 'weapon', 'still', '38', 'six-shooter', 'chambers', 'loaded', 'Tisk', 'tisk', 'rule', 'number', 'one', 'gun', 'fighter', 'was', 'always', 'leave', 'chamber', 'hammer', 'empty.But', 'fantasy', 'who', 'Machine', 'guns', 'power', 'suits', 'antigravity', 'get', 'picture', 'Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'seriously', 'anime', 'other', 'hand', 'Wendee', 'Lee', 'English', 'voice', 'Rushuna', 'What', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'till', 'saw', 'ending', 'credits', 'Hey', 'played', 'many', 'female', 'roles', 'few', 'male', 'roles', 'even', 'turtle', 'ability', 'create', 'new', 'voice', ""n't"", 'shocker', 'also', 'English', 'writer', 'voice', 'director', 'know', 'translation', 'going', 'be', 'good', 'pride', 'work', 'other', 'words', 'was', 'nice', 'surprise.Too', 'bad', 'original', 'material', 'so', 'flawed', 'Sorry', 'there', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'fan', 'service', 'art', 'work', ""n't"", 'that', 'great', 'gun', 'energy', 'plot', 'failed', 'hook', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'first', 'disc.Now', 'lots', 'extras', 'form', 'Japanese', 'commentary', 'episode', 'even', 'pre-broadcasting', 'special', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'faults', 'would', 'give', 'only', 'three', 'five', 'happen', 'be', 'fan', 'Wendee', 'Lee', 'point']",N/A

Lucky for him, he is saved by the beautiful/bubbly Rushuna and her gun-slinging skills.  As they both travel to different towns, they are constantly being chased/shot at by various enemy senshi.  The main enemy in the first 4 episodes is the Jester, who looks pretty freaky due to his ""Jester"" mask that covers his entire face.  He has the ability to stop Rushuna in her tracks, preventing her from pulling the trigger.  He also has the ability to fly in the air and teleport himself all over the place, serving as the eyes and ears of.....

So I went ahead and ordered the 3rd vol and art box again through someone else here on Amazon and it came with both vol. 1 and vol. 2 which was crazy so now I have an extra vol. 1 and vol.2 which I'm not complaining about.

891402,A1B9VX6MZ0MZ1T,B0007UVXAO,Sesho,"[3, 3]","As a Samurai during the great Japanese Civil War, Yajiro Torajima finds himself on the losing side of history as firearms have become the great equalizer. He's resorted to becoming a mercenary and has joined with other samurai to rescue their Lord, whose castle and life are being held for ransom by a bandit gang. Of course the samurai are cut down by gunfire, but Yajiro survives and is saved by a beautiful gun toting lady named Rushuna, who thinks you can end all war with a smile! Even though she finds herself fighting all the time, she never kills. She was sent out by her teacher to show the world that might does not make right. Yajiro, who was just a hired warrior up to this point, while skeptical of Rushuna's ideals, nevertheless sees something admirable in her beliefs and her skill with a pistol and tags along with her perhaps in order to become more like her.  In Volume 1, the two travel from town to town, trying to right wrongs without hurting anyone, but you know, some evildoers just don't listen to reason! So that's when the pistol and katana come out.I found Grenadier quite enjoyable. You should know right off that you shouldn't take this show too seriously. Rushuna is able to fire off incredible feats of shooting with her six-shooter. One of the funnier moments in episode 1 is when she shoots a line of 4 bad guys in a row, and they swan dive like extras from some bad action move. Another unorthodox move used by Rushuna is when she runs out of bullets, she flexes her bosom and six more bullets pop from between her breasts and then she makes a swift motion, reloading the bullets as they hang in the air! While there is a lot of fan service in this show, it never gets dirty, and it was refreshing that Yajiro is not the stereotypical pervert that would usually be tagging along with this buxom blonde. He doesn't really think much of taking a bath with Rushuna and seems more adult. He's more of a companion who wants to improve his moral character by being around Rushuna. I liked the two main characters a lot. If you don't take it too seriously, you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of this anime.",4,A GUNSLINGER AND A SAMURAI,1153958400,"07 27, 2006",2006,2132,"['Samurai', 'great', 'Japanese', 'Civil', 'War', 'Yajiro', 'Torajima', 'losing', 'side', 'history', 'firearms', 'have', 'become', 'great', 'equalizer', 'resorted', 'becoming', 'mercenary', 'joined', 'other', 'samurai', 'rescue', 'Lord', 'castle', 'life', 'are', 'being', 'held', 'ransom', 'bandit', 'gang', 'course', 'samurai', 'are', 'cut', 'down', 'gunfire', 'Yajiro', 'survives', 'saved', 'beautiful', 'gun', 'toting', 'lady', 'named', 'Rushuna', 'who', 'can', 'end', 'war', 'smile', 'Even', 'fighting', 'time', 'never', 'kills', 'was', 'sent', 'out', 'teacher', 'show', 'world', 'might', 'not', 'make', 'right', 'Yajiro', 'who', 'was', 'just', 'hired', 'warrior', 'up', 'point', 'skeptical', 'Rushuna', 'ideals', 'nevertheless', 'something', 'admirable', 'beliefs', 'skill', 'pistol', 'tags', 'perhaps', 'order', 'become', 'more', 'Volume', '1', 'two', 'travel', 'town', 'town', 'trying', 'right', 'wrongs', 'hurting', 'anyone', 'know', 'evildoers', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'reason', 'when', 'pistol', 'katana', 'come', 'out.I', 'found', 'Grenadier', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'should', 'know', 'right', 'off', 'should', ""n't"", 'take', 'show', 'too', 'seriously', 'Rushuna', 'able', 'fire', 'off', 'incredible', 'feats', 'shooting', 'six-shooter', 'One', 'funnier', 'moments', 'episode', '1', 'when', 'shoots', 'line', '4', 'bad', 'guys', 'row', 'swan', 'dive', 'extras', 'bad', 'action', 'move', 'unorthodox', 'move', 'used', 'Rushuna', 'when', 'bullets', 'flexes', 'bosom', 'six', 'more', 'bullets', 'pop', 'breasts', 'then', 'swift', 'motion', 'reloading', 'bullets', 'hang', 'air', 'lot', 'fan', 'service', 'show', 'never', 'dirty', 'was', 'refreshing', 'Yajiro', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'pervert', 'would', 'usually', 'be', 'tagging', 'along', 'buxom', 'blonde', ""n't"", 'really', 'think', 'much', 'taking', 'bath', 'Rushuna', 'more', 'adult', 'more', 'companion', 'who', 'improve', 'moral', 'character', 'being', 'around', 'Rushuna', 'liked', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'lot', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'enjoyment', 'anime']",N/A
