1127420,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B0010X8NF0,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[6, 20]","`The Darjeeling Limited,' should be evaluated by how much mirth and wisdom it provides.  The film comes across like a train wreck, giving us a fresh take on the familiar culture clash between East and West.  While watching this film, I kept thinking of The Beatles and their films.  One reason is that the three brothers presented run (madcap) through the titled Indian train; the other is that they journey through the heart of India searching for wisdom.At the start of the movie Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is in France.  He is a successful novelist renting a Paris hotel room for weeks on end.  His lover calls, saying she has found him and asks him if she can arrive within a half hour.  He says alright, but when she does arrive, it is established that he is there to get away from her.  Even so, they feel so passionate about each other, they find it hard to part ways.  He had to flee to Paris, but he doesn't resist her advances.In the next frame of the movie, Jack catches up to his brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Peter (Adrien Brody).  All agree to an enlightening adventure to get away from it all, while their parents have been in India for some time.  It is quickly established that their father passed away there, and their mother has entered a convent and become a nun.  Francis is the eldest, and although he is the most vocal about letting go and absorbing the lessons they can gain from the East, he is also the most grasping and controlling of the other two.He sets their purpose with three agreements:  A.) Seek the unknown B.) with an open mind..., and C.) even if it`s shocking and painful.  Funny, but without knowing it, we learn without preaching that all of them have brought plenty of baggage (literally as well as figuratively) along their journey.In one telling scene, they are running for the Darjeeling Limited, and they all make it aboard while another man (Bill Murray) is left behind.  Later on, because of mishaps that shouldn't be mentioned, they catch up to another train, and we find this character is on the same train.  Just be still and don't run for trains, I can hear Wes Anderson, showing us in many frames.  You'll catch another one.  The journey within is supreme.  ""Arrive without traveling,"" as George Harrison wrote and sang for The Beatles' ""The Inner Light"".  There is a more substantial development that occurs, but I'll leave you to unearth that for yourselves.`The Darjeeling Limited' is more than a travel adventure.  While I don't think mirth and wisdom were necessarily brought in aces, they certainly were highly present.  Being a person who loves a visual feast, I couldn't help but be partial to Anderson's shifting 90-degree angle camera changes and how he captures the color and light.  Besides the yellow lettering framing a vivid blue train, we have nearly neon colors contrasting with bright saris and white turbans.  All in all, the film is not entirely a substantial journey, but an arresting one at that.",3,East and West Collide,1204502400,"03 3, 2008",2008,2975,"['Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'should', 'be', 'evaluated', 'how', 'much', 'mirth', 'wisdom', 'film', 'train', 'wreck', 'giving', 'fresh', 'take', 'familiar', 'culture', 'clash', 'East', 'West', 'watching', 'film', 'kept', 'thinking', 'Beatles', 'films', 'One', 'reason', 'three', 'brothers', 'presented', 'run', 'madcap', 'titled', 'Indian', 'train', 'other', 'journey', 'heart', 'India', 'searching', 'start', 'movie', 'Jack', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'France', 'successful', 'novelist', 'renting', 'Paris', 'hotel', 'room', 'weeks', 'end', 'lover', 'saying', 'found', 'can', 'arrive', 'half', 'hour', 'alright', 'when', 'arrive', 'established', 'there', 'get', 'away', 'Even', 'so', 'feel', 'so', 'passionate', 'other', 'find', 'hard', 'part', 'ways', 'had', 'flee', 'Paris', ""n't"", 'resist', 'advances.In', 'next', 'frame', 'movie', 'Jack', 'up', 'brothers', 'Francis', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Peter', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'agree', 'enlightening', 'adventure', 'get', 'away', 'parents', 'have', 'been', 'India', 'time', 'quickly', 'established', 'father', 'passed', 'away', 'there', 'mother', 'entered', 'convent', 'become', 'nun', 'Francis', 'eldest', 'most', 'vocal', 'letting', 'go', 'absorbing', 'lessons', 'can', 'gain', 'East', 'also', 'most', 'grasping', 'controlling', 'other', 'two.He', 'sets', 'purpose', 'three', 'agreements', 'Seek', 'unknown', 'B', 'open', 'mind', 'C.', 'even', 's', 'shocking', 'painful', 'Funny', 'knowing', 'learn', 'preaching', 'have', 'brought', 'plenty', 'baggage', 'literally', 'as', 'well', 'figuratively', 'journey.In', 'one', 'telling', 'scene', 'are', 'running', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'make', 'man', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'left', 'behind', 'Later', 'mishaps', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'mentioned', 'catch', 'up', 'train', 'find', 'character', 'same', 'train', 'Just', 'be', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'run', 'trains', 'can', 'hear', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'showing', 'many', 'frames', ""'ll"", 'catch', 'one', 'journey', 'supreme', 'Arrive', 'traveling', 'George', 'Harrison', 'wrote', 'sang', 'Beatles', 'Inner', 'Light', 'more', 'substantial', 'development', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'unearth', 'yourselves.', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'more', 'travel', 'adventure', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mirth', 'wisdom', 'were', 'necessarily', 'brought', 'aces', 'certainly', 'were', 'highly', 'present', 'Being', 'person', 'who', 'visual', 'feast', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'be', 'partial', 'Anderson', 'shifting', '90-degree', 'angle', 'camera', 'changes', 'how', 'color', 'light', 'yellow', 'lettering', 'framing', 'vivid', 'blue', 'train', 'have', 'nearly', 'neon', 'colors', 'contrasting', 'bright', 'saris', 'white', 'turbans', 'film', 'not', 'entirely', 'substantial', 'journey', 'arresting', 'one']",N/A

I am, however, a fan of good cinema. To me The Darjeeling Limited demonstrates both the beauty and simplicity of the cinematic form, but more than that, it demonstrates potential. It demonstrates what is possible, not only in terms of the creative form, but also what the Hollywood machine; the accountants, backers, producers and studio executives (those outside of the artistic process) are capable of agreeing to finance. This is the real brilliance of this project.In terms of the actual cinematic experience, the sets, costumes, music, cinematography, dialogue and performances are about as good as I have seen in a LONG while; this is such a very coherent project which is ultimately the antithesis of what the potential viewer can engage with if they head down to their local rental shop. I think this is a film even detractors should watch once, because I sincerely believe that to anyone who watches it, their frame-of-reference will be shifted, altered and expanded. If you hate this film, so-be-it, but you might want to ask yourself why; what underlies that dislike and distaste. Because maybe, just maybe,  the films you have been watching thus far in your life have blunted your sensitivities and sensibilities to real Art and real beauty.

1127432,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B0010X8NF0,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[1, 3]","Wes Anderson films are an acquired taste. FromBottle Rocket,Rushmore,The Royal Tenenbaums,The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and finally this film, THE DARJEELING LIMITED, quirkiness is a theme that runs throughout writer/director Anderson's repertoire. He also loves working with the Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen) as well as Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray. So -- not surprisingly -- Owen, Anjelica and Bill all show up at some point in this one. They are, in fact, becoming what I like to call ""the quirky cadre.""Anderson isn't one of those ""in-your-face"" kind of directors. He doesn't spoonfeed you anything, and this is both fun and frustrating. The fun comes from personal discoveries related to the scenes and situations he puts his characters in. The frustration is that sometimes the disconnects are too extreme.This time we have the three Whitman brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson,Cars), Peter (Adrien Brody,Hollywoodland), and Jack (Jason Schwarztman,Marie Antoinette). Their father has recently passed away and the brothers take on a trip to India to find their absent mother. In the meantime, we get to witness the bizarreness of this family unit. Francis (Wilson) is a control freak who has to have every minute detail pinned down. Peter (Brody) is somewhat of a kleptomaniac. And Jack (Schwartzman) is a damaged guy stuck on a damaged gal (played by Natalie Portman,Closer). The three boys try to rediscover their brotherly bonds by taking The Darjeeling Limited (a train) across India in search of their father's hopes for them and their mother's reasons for not attending her husband's funeral. There are some absolutely hysterical, funny, and poignant moments, sometimes all wrapped up in one scene. The one that comes to mind the most is when the brothers witness a raft trapped in some rapids with three boys clinging on for dear life. They put aside all of their differences and go into savior mode without thinking, and it is a defining moment within the brothers' lives. What comes after is funny and sad. They finally break free of their bonds to their parents and leave all of their luggage behind (literally and metaphorically), thanks to the families they meet outside their own.The main frustration most viewers might have with the movie is the music. There really is no connection between what is happening and the tunes (Anderson, I believe, just enjoyed the Indian music and decided to incorporate it into the film, and be damned what anyone might think). The extreme disconnect was very bothersome for this viewer.Even so, this is a good quirky Anderson film with great color shots (the train and the surrounding terrain), an uplifting story (in the end), and some fine acting by all (especially by Owen Wilson).",4,The Quirkly Cadre Rides Again!,1206921600,"03 31, 2008",2008,2743,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'are', 'acquired', 'taste', 'FromBottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'finally', 'film', 'THE', 'DARJEELING', 'LIMITED', 'quirkiness', 'theme', 'writer/director', 'Anderson', 'repertoire', 'also', 'working', 'Wilson', 'brothers', 'Luke', 'Owen', 'as', 'well', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'So', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Owen', 'Anjelica', 'Bill', 'show', 'up', 'point', 'one', 'are', 'fact', 'becoming', 'what', 'like', 'call', 'quirky', 'cadre', 'Anderson', ""n't"", 'one', 'in-your-face', 'kind', 'directors', ""n't"", 'spoonfeed', 'anything', 'fun', 'frustrating', 'fun', 'personal', 'discoveries', 'related', 'scenes', 'situations', 'characters', 'frustration', 'sometimes', 'disconnects', 'are', 'too', 'extreme.This', 'time', 'have', 'three', 'Whitman', 'brothers', 'Francis', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Cars', 'Peter', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Hollywoodland', 'Jack', 'Jason', 'Schwarztman', 'Marie', 'Antoinette', 'father', 'recently', 'passed', 'away', 'brothers', 'take', 'trip', 'India', 'find', 'absent', 'mother', 'meantime', 'get', 'witness', 'bizarreness', 'family', 'unit', 'Francis', 'Wilson', 'control', 'freak', 'who', 'have', 'minute', 'detail', 'pinned', 'down', 'Peter', 'Brody', 'somewhat', 'kleptomaniac', 'Jack', 'Schwartzman', 'damaged', 'guy', 'stuck', 'damaged', 'gal', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Closer', 'three', 'boys', 'try', 'rediscover', 'brotherly', 'bonds', 'taking', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'train', 'India', 'search', 'father', 'hopes', 'mother', 'reasons', 'not', 'attending', 'husband', 'funeral', 'are', 'absolutely', 'hysterical', 'funny', 'poignant', 'moments', 'sometimes', 'wrapped', 'up', 'one', 'scene', 'one', 'mind', 'most', 'when', 'brothers', 'witness', 'raft', 'trapped', 'rapids', 'three', 'boys', 'clinging', 'dear', 'life', 'put', 'aside', 'differences', 'go', 'savior', 'mode', 'thinking', 'defining', 'moment', 'brothers', 'lives', 'What', 'funny', 'sad', 'finally', 'break', 'free', 'bonds', 'parents', 'leave', 'luggage', 'literally', 'metaphorically', 'thanks', 'families', 'meet', 'own.The', 'main', 'frustration', 'most', 'viewers', 'might', 'have', 'movie', 'music', 'really', 'connection', 'what', 'happening', 'tunes', 'Anderson', 'believe', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'Indian', 'music', 'decided', 'incorporate', 'film', 'be', 'damned', 'what', 'anyone', 'might', 'think', 'extreme', 'disconnect', 'was', 'very', 'bothersome', 'viewer.Even', 'so', 'good', 'quirky', 'Anderson', 'film', 'great', 'color', 'shots', 'train', 'surrounding', 'terrain', 'uplifting', 'story', 'end', 'fine', 'acting', 'especially', 'Owen', 'Wilson']",N/A

1127434,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B0010X8NF0,Brian E. Erland,"[38, 43]","Synopsis: An ornate and psychedelically colored train known as the Darjeeling Limited transports three estranged brothers; Francis (Owen Wilson), Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) to destinations unknown (actually Francis is attempting to arrange a rendezvous with their constantly disappearing Mother (Anjelica Huston) now living as a nun in Tibet). It has only been a year since their Father's tragic death and each brother carries their own personal heartache over his passing and their Mother's disturbing absence from the funeral.As one comes to expect when traveling with others, close proximity, annoying behaviors and old wounds eventually surface which must be dealt with as they arise. Add to the mix unforeseen events both aboard the train and at intermittent stopovers along the way and you have the makings of a transformational experience unlike anything the brothers could have anticipated.Critique: The '07 film `The Darjeeling Limited' begins painfully slow and incomprehensibly weird but if you have the fortitude to survive the first 40 minutes you will eventually find yourself on a delightfully oddball, unpredictable trek across the Indian subcontinent on a spiritual journey in search of physical, emotional and relational healing.

In true comedy form, we get to see the brotherly love and jealously that siblings often have for each other.

Once again we get to see Owen Wilson, Bill Murray (in a cameo), Jason Schwartzman, and Anjelica Huston.  But we also see the great Adrien Brody playing one of the three brothers.

1127436,A11SPSEM08VIXX,B0010X8NF0,"Carbonadam ""Ladies and gentleman, I hope that...","[10, 14]","Wes Anderson's films are often misunderstood. Starchy, disillusioned cynics need not see his films. His films are sentimental and adhere to sensibilities that require a certain amount of adolescence lingering on in your adulthood. If you have grown up so much that you no longer wish to partake in any kind of silliness, horseplay, or tomfoolery then you will most likely be lost watching this film as well as his others. This is not to say that his films are not for adults. They are. His films are almost always made seemingly for the PG13 rating system of today but are slightly peppered with a few things that will surly garner an R rating. I can easily imagine him throwing in some F-words like this film had, or like in the Royal Tenenbaums, a nude poster for Margot's play. I think he wants the films to be rated R and does not want his childlike veneer that lies over all his work to be mistook for something geared towards kids. One of the best ways to look at his films is to just imagine the film as how a child might imagine adulthood. They always have a spy-like secret agent feel to them. I remember the way I felt when I was 7 when I had stayed up late the night before to watch a James Bond film on TV. I felt the thrill of having been a witness to adulthood, danger, sex, and quick one liner comedy. All Wes Anderson films have this, and perfectly recreate this feeling in me.This film, as well as his others all have a focused attention to subtext and mes-en-scene throughout . The characters as well as the carefully constructed sets have many detailed props, much of which is never fully explained. Bruises, glasses, a belt, a robe, a song or an ipod, perfume, a poisonous snake (I had childhood love of reptiles), and many mysterious compartments on a beautiful train all are there for your enjoyment. Some times items are explained and other times they are not. This gives the film extraordinary depth, intricacy and weight that is often lacking in most films today. His films are put together so well and with such care that you leave the theater feeling as though you were just on an adventure that you have been waiting for all your life. It's not coincidence that he uses homes, boats, and now a train to carefully construct his story around. These are vehicles in which throughout our daily lives, stuff happens. They facilitate the adventures for the people who are interacting within them. The possibility for adventure is always present when one goes on a trip, takes on a task, or goes home after being away for a long time. Anderson understands this as perfectly as any human on this planet can. Only Stanley Kubrick filled his films with as much props and used as much subtext and symbolism. Anderson is not as allegorical as Kubrick was and his films are certainly much, much different. Still the compositional care to film as a visual medium in which each shot needs the same amount of care and consideration as the one that just followed is 100% present on par with Kubrick.I see in Anderson's films many possible influences that he has possibly used. Here are a few of them: Joseph Cornell, Peanuts, J D Salinger, The Hardy Boys, Ian Fleming,  Johnny Quest, Jacques Cousteau, Kramer VS Kramer, Woody Allen, Devo, Classical music, and indoor home made tents under blankets. This is just a short list. Anderson has admitted to several of these. Just spotting the Egon Schiele book neatly placed by a water color in Hotel Chevalier is proof positive that Wes has good taste in Art and has a depth that can not easily be summed up in just a short list.He is the best and most unique filmmaker alive today and has single handedly taken the place of several of the old guard who are either dead, or way over the hump and beyond their prime. Anderson has also brought back to the movie-plex a push for the old cinema that used to draw people in with stories and tales meant to make us think, imagine, and feel like we have experienced something meaningful without making us feel guilty or overtly sad.  I will be eagerly awaiting his next film, The Fantastic Mr Fox, based on the book of the same name by Roald Dahl. This film is for kids but if you have read the book, it is, for a kids book, extremely violent and full of danger. The fact that Anderson is crossing the fence and visiting a kids story rife with danger for his next film is no surprise to me. I could easily see him having a career that goes back and forth between adult-themed films geared for kids, and kid-themed films geared for adults.  I will be there with my pole vault waiting to get in.Bravo Mr Anderson!",5,Anderson's Best Yet,1193702400,"10 30, 2007",2007,4610,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'are', 'often', 'misunderstood', 'Starchy', 'disillusioned', 'cynics', 'need', 'not', 'see', 'films', 'films', 'are', 'sentimental', 'adhere', 'sensibilities', 'require', 'certain', 'amount', 'adolescence', 'lingering', 'adulthood', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'so', 'much', 'no', 'longer', 'wish', 'partake', 'kind', 'silliness', 'horseplay', 'tomfoolery', 'then', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'lost', 'watching', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'not', 'say', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'adults', 'are', 'films', 'are', 'almost', 'always', 'made', 'seemingly', 'PG13', 'rating', 'system', 'today', 'are', 'slightly', 'peppered', 'few', 'things', 'will', 'surly', 'garner', 'R', 'rating', 'can', 'easily', 'imagine', 'throwing', 'F-words', 'film', 'had', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'nude', 'poster', 'Margot', 'play', 'think', 'films', 'be', 'rated', 'R', 'not', 'want', 'childlike', 'veneer', 'work', 'be', 'mistook', 'something', 'geared', 'towards', 'kids', 'One', 'best', 'ways', 'look', 'films', 'just', 'imagine', 'film', 'how', 'child', 'might', 'imagine', 'adulthood', 'always', 'have', 'spy-like', 'secret', 'agent', 'feel', 'remember', 'way', 'felt', 'when', 'was', '7', 'when', 'had', 'stayed', 'up', 'late', 'night', 'watch', 'James', 'Bond', 'film', 'TV', 'felt', 'thrill', 'having', 'been', 'witness', 'adulthood', 'danger', 'sex', 'quick', 'one', 'liner', 'comedy', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'have', 'perfectly', 'recreate', 'feeling', 'me.This', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'have', 'focused', 'attention', 'subtext', 'mes-en-scene', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'sets', 'have', 'many', 'detailed', 'props', 'much', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'Bruises', 'glasses', 'belt', 'robe', 'song', 'ipod', 'perfume', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'had', 'childhood', 'love', 'reptiles', 'many', 'mysterious', 'compartments', 'beautiful', 'train', 'are', 'there', 'enjoyment', 'times', 'items', 'are', 'explained', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'not', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'depth', 'intricacy', 'weight', 'often', 'lacking', 'most', 'films', 'today', 'films', 'are', 'put', 'together', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'care', 'leave', 'theater', 'feeling', 'were', 'just', 'adventure', 'have', 'been', 'waiting', 'life', 'not', 'coincidence', 'homes', 'boats', 'now', 'train', 'carefully', 'construct', 'story', 'around', 'are', 'vehicles', 'daily', 'lives', 'stuff', 'happens', 'facilitate', 'adventures', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'interacting', 'possibility', 'adventure', 'always', 'present', 'when', 'one', 'trip', 'task', 'home', 'being', 'away', 'long', 'time', 'Anderson', 'as', 'perfectly', 'human', 'planet', 'can', 'Only', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'filled', 'films', 'as', 'much', 'props', 'used', 'as', 'much', 'subtext', 'symbolism', 'Anderson', 'not', 'as', 'allegorical', 'Kubrick', 'was', 'films', 'are', 'certainly', 'much', 'much', 'different', 'Still', 'compositional', 'care', 'film', 'visual', 'medium', 'shot', 'same', 'amount', 'care', 'consideration', 'one', 'just', 'followed', '100', '%', 'present', 'par', 'Kubrick.I', 'see', 'Anderson', 'films', 'many', 'possible', 'influences', 'possibly', 'used', 'Here', 'are', 'few', 'Joseph', 'Cornell', 'Peanuts', 'J', 'D', 'Salinger', 'Hardy', 'Boys', 'Ian', 'Fleming', 'Johnny', 'Quest', 'Jacques', 'Cousteau', 'Kramer', 'VS', 'Kramer', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Devo', 'Classical', 'music', 'indoor', 'home', 'made', 'tents', 'blankets', 'just', 'short', 'list', 'Anderson', 'admitted', 'several', 'Just', 'spotting', 'Egon', 'Schiele', 'book', 'neatly', 'placed', 'water', 'color', 'Hotel', 'Chevalier', 'proof', 'positive', 'Wes', 'good', 'taste', 'Art', 'depth', 'can', 'not', 'easily', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'just', 'short', 'list.He', 'best', 'most', 'unique', 'filmmaker', 'alive', 'today', 'single', 'handedly', 'taken', 'place', 'several', 'old', 'guard', 'who', 'are', 'dead', 'way', 'hump', 'prime', 'Anderson', 'also', 'brought', 'back', 'movie-plex', 'push', 'old', 'cinema', 'used', 'draw', 'people', 'stories', 'tales', 'meant', 'make', 'think', 'imagine', 'feel', 'have', 'experienced', 'something', 'meaningful', 'making', 'feel', 'guilty', 'overtly', 'sad', 'will', 'be', 'eagerly', 'awaiting', 'next', 'film', 'Fantastic', 'Mr', 'Fox', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'Roald', 'Dahl', 'film', 'kids', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'kids', 'book', 'extremely', 'violent', 'full', 'danger', 'fact', 'Anderson', 'crossing', 'fence', 'visiting', 'kids', 'story', 'rife', 'danger', 'next', 'film', 'surprise', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'having', 'career', 'back', 'forth', 'adult-themed', 'films', 'geared', 'kids', 'kid-themed', 'films', 'geared', 'adults', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'pole', 'vault', 'waiting', 'get', 'in.Bravo', 'Mr', 'Anderson']",N/A

1127441,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,B0010X8NF0,Christopher Culver,"[3, 5]","Wes Anderson's THE DARJEELING LIMITED has three brothers meeting up for a train journey through India after a year of not talking. The youngest Jack (Jason Schwartzman) is a budding writer and womanizer, Peter (Adrien Brody) is a married man intimidated by the prospect of children, and the eldest Francis (Owen Wilson) is a rich business recovering from a motorcycle accident. The three have been separated since the death of their father, and Francis wants them to rediscover their brotherly solidarity.THE DARJEELING LIMITED, for all its ""exotic"" setting, is pretty similar to Anderson's previous films THE LIFE AQUATIC and THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS with its story of a family that has long squabbled but which, after many trials and tribulations over the film, finds peace together in the end. Having seen all of Wilson's earlier output, I found THE DARJEELING LIMITED basically repeating a formula. It's an entertaining film to an extent, but Anderson is stuck in a rut. The treatment of India in the film sits uneasy with me. The train journey the brothers take is a fantasy, and the Indians the movie among are stereotypes with none given much of a personality (the two actors playing Indian train employees are in fact Westerners). At one point a village child dies, and it's almost appalling how Anderson uses this to advance the plot of the three brothers as if it were a mechanical action, with no sympathy to how the villagers around them would feel.The cinematography is fairly elegant, and a few slapstick scenes drew a chuckle. Most memorable was a commentary on the trend well-known to travelers that, no matter how much it looks like you'll have a bus to yourself in the Third World, it will always been crammed full by the time it leaves. Still, I find RUSHMORE or THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS to still be, almost a decade on, Wilson's strongest achievements.",3,"Entertaining on one viewing, but it's little more than Anderson's last two movies given a more exotic setting",1245715200,"06 23, 2009",2009,1866,"['Wes', 'Anderson', 'THE', 'DARJEELING', 'LIMITED', 'three', 'brothers', 'meeting', 'up', 'train', 'journey', 'India', 'year', 'not', 'talking', 'youngest', 'Jack', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'budding', 'writer', 'womanizer', 'Peter', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'married', 'man', 'intimidated', 'prospect', 'children', 'eldest', 'Francis', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'rich', 'business', 'recovering', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'three', 'have', 'been', 'separated', 'death', 'father', 'Francis', 'rediscover', 'brotherly', 'solidarity.THE', 'DARJEELING', 'LIMITED', 'exotic', 'setting', 'pretty', 'similar', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'films', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AQUATIC', 'THE', 'ROYAL', 'TENNENBAUMS', 'story', 'family', 'long', 'squabbled', 'many', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'film', 'peace', 'together', 'end', 'Having', 'seen', 'Wilson', 'earlier', 'output', 'found', 'THE', 'DARJEELING', 'LIMITED', 'basically', 'repeating', 'formula', 'entertaining', 'film', 'extent', 'Anderson', 'stuck', 'rut', 'treatment', 'India', 'film', 'uneasy', 'train', 'journey', 'brothers', 'take', 'fantasy', 'Indians', 'movie', 'are', 'stereotypes', 'none', 'given', 'much', 'personality', 'two', 'actors', 'playing', 'Indian', 'train', 'employees', 'are', 'fact', 'Westerners', 'one', 'point', 'village', 'child', 'dies', 'almost', 'appalling', 'how', 'Anderson', 'advance', 'plot', 'three', 'brothers', 'were', 'mechanical', 'action', 'sympathy', 'how', 'villagers', 'would', 'feel.The', 'cinematography', 'fairly', 'elegant', 'few', 'slapstick', 'scenes', 'drew', 'chuckle', 'Most', 'memorable', 'was', 'commentary', 'trend', 'well-known', 'travelers', 'matter', 'how', 'much', ""'ll"", 'have', 'bus', 'yourself', 'Third', 'World', 'will', 'always', 'been', 'crammed', 'full', 'time', 'Still', 'find', 'RUSHMORE', 'ROYAL', 'TENNENBAUMS', 'still', 'be', 'almost', 'decade', 'Wilson', 'strongest', 'achievements']",N/A

But, in no way, shape, nor form, can anyone who understands and appreciates the art of cinema call this a good, much less great film, and those who have praised it or claimed it was one of the best films of its year are idiots, pure and simple. It is, in a sense, the sine qua non of mediocrity, and Anderson is the same thing in the realm of directors, which only begs the question as to what The Criterion Collection finds so valuable about his cinematic canon. More than that, I get the real sense, given Anderson's comments on the audio commentary track, and in the extra features, that he is not even trying to grow and make films of substance and quality any longer. And this is a shame, because Rushmore, the first film of his to break big, was a good film, and one which showed potential for Anderson to become a valuable asset for American cinema. In fact, only David Gordon Green's debut film, George Washington, showed more potential for a young American filmmaker, in the last dozen years, yet he too has stagnated, although his problem is more based in mere selling out to Hollywood and its conventions, whereas Anderson seems to be just creatively dead. Given his working and personal relationship with Roman Coppola- who's proven he's a good screenwriter, it would seem that Coppola would be the person to turn to for his next film's screenplay; to get outside of Andersonworld.

I'll admit it is not for everybody and has a very specific type of humor to it. Many will find it boring, but I didn't mind it. Also, I'm not very well-known of Wes Anderson's films just yet other than Fantastic Mr. Fox, which I enjoyed and thought was also a little odd and dry but overall pretty neatly done. I can see his resemblences throughout both films and can imagine his others are similar as well. I laughed out loud quite a few good times especially at Jason Schwartzman's character, Jack.  I felt all the brothers (Brody, Wilson, & Schwartzman) were well cast and each brought their own humor to the movie. The overall basis of the film is these three brothers whom no longer act like brothers riding on the Darjeeling Express Train through India to see their mother who is in the Himilayas. They encounter a few obstacles in the way, but manage to also find themselves and reconnect as brothers through their ""spiritual"" journey.The Darjeeling Limited is a Pt. 2 of Wes Anderson's film in a whole. The Pt. 1 is ""Hotel Chevalier"" which is a 13 minute short film about Jack's character in France before he got on the Darjeeling Express. This short film introduces Natalie Portman's character which can be seen briefly in the actual movie. The Short film, which should be watched before the actual movie, indeed offers more to the movie rather than watching the movie alone.

My favorite things about his movies are the way they look (in both the technical and artistic sense), and the understated lack of normalcy of the way the characters talk.  On the weirdness rainbow, it's more mature than quirkiness, and milder than eccentricity.  Also, everything is deliberate, so there isn't that ""improv"" vibe at all.If I had never seen this movie, and I was dropped in a seat in front of a screen with this on it without me knowing what it was, I'd figure out it was a Wes Anderson film as soon as Adrien Brody was running for the train in slow motion to some song from the 60s or 70s.  That is a compliment.Wes Anderson has the best formula around, so I think he'd be an idiot to mess with it.

In France, he meets with his ex-girlfriend in his posh hotel room. The usually modest Natalie Portman shows quite a bit of skin in this film and shares quite a sensual moment (especially for an Anderson film) with Jason Schwartzman's character.Also included is a theatrical trailer.There is an audio commentary by writer/director Wes Anderson, co-writers Jason Schwartzman and Roman Coppola. The three of them start off discussing their writing process and how one's subconscious plays a role. They touch upon various aspects of the production, including production design, cinematography, and so on. Interestingly, the three of them were responsible for their own Whitman brother to write for. A lot of the commentary is spent recounting all kinds of filming anecdotes.The second disc starts off with a ""Conversation with James Ivory."" He and Anderson talk about the Indian music used in the film. Anderson was influenced by and used several musical cues from Ivory's films. The veteran filmmaker talks about some of his early Indian films with clips illustrating some of the music from it that Anderson used.There is a visual essay by Matt Zoller Seitz about the film and how it best sums up everything about Anderson's films. Seitz provides fascinating analysis over clips from the film and the short film as well.Also included is a 40 minute making of documentary by Barry Braverman. It takes a fly-on-the-wall approach to the production with plenty of footage of Anderson and his crew filming on location. The documentary provides some fascinating insight into what it must be like to make a film there and how Anderson adapted his methods there.""Sriharsh's Audition"" features footage of a child Indian actor trying out for the film.There is a deleted scene and two alternate takes that run just over three minutes. We see Peter Whitman playing cricket with some Indians. There is an alternate take of the three brothers running down a hill and then one of them trying to board an airplane.Also included is a clever American Express commercial that Anderson shot around the time ofThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou - Criterion Collection. In it, the filmmaker slyly parodies the notion of making a film while also paying homage to Francois Truffaut's filmDay for Night.""Oakley Friedberg/Packer Speech"" is a slideshow presentation that a boy made while his parents were working on Darjeeling Limited.

The movie was set in India but it was clear that the writers had absolutely no idea of what India was, and kept writing in stuff that was completely inconsistent with the culture of the people.  Ignorance is forgivable, but it is clear that the writers made no attempt to understand the subject.  Furthermore since the movie was filmed in India, I am sure that there had to have been countless comments from the Indians involved in the production as to the implausibility of many of the situations.  It begins with the brief sexual encounter with Rita.  This was certainly possible but highly implausible.  One of the most striking was the scene with the obviously conservative Sikh (evidenced by the turban and other attributes of his religion), having a relationship with a Hindu girl (shown by the prominent  bindi with no kara - bracelet kara) smoking a cigarette.  (Tobacco is prohibited among Sikhs.)  A cinematic statement as bold as this one demanded some type of exposition, yet none came.  I could only suppose that this was the result of complete ignorance.  The move continues to move along without any clear direction and merely uses India in an incredibly awkward fashion as a backdrop for this poorly conceived tale.But as bad as Darjeeling Limited was, it stood out as a comedic masterpiece compared with its prequel, Hotel Chevalier.  This was a plodding piece that served no function other than to waste our time.

Forever playing the role of bossy, big brother, he convinces his younger brothers to join him on a spiritual journey in India to reconnect and become close, like they used to be. He also has a hidden motive to reconnect to their vanishing mother who lives as a nun in India after their father's death (Angelica Huston). Much of the movie happens on this train called the Darjeeling Limited, winding throughout the exotic countryside of India.Jack (Jason Schwartzman) always walks around barefooted, in a suit; Peter (Adrian Brody) wears his deceased father's sunglasses, with the prescription still in them; Francis walks around with a head full of gauze bandages, with one fancy, black shoe on, and one street-bought, moccasin-like shoe on (after getting one of his $3000 shoes stolen from an Indian shoe-shine boy).Their journey is one of forever getting into trouble on the train, and glimmers of self-discovery--one heroic deed, resulting in life-and-death, offers the brothers a good look at themselves.The tossing away of the precious, yet burdensome luggage seems also symbolic of lugging around ""extra baggage"". In the end, the brothers toss it all behind themselves, showing the importance of freeing oneself from ludicrous amounts of materialistic excess.Like the brothers, we are all on that long, winding journey of figuring out who we are and why we do the crazy things that we do. In the end, maybe the brothers have tossed out extra junk, mind-dulling drugs and all, but still--the goofy bad boys that they are--go out for a smoke and a drink.Seemingly more trusting, the brothers seemed to have a new appreciation of each other.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[127, 148]","Wes Anderson is at his best when he explores a small group of people -- sometimes family, sometimes not -- and explores what makes them tick.And after the cluttered ""The Life Aquatic of Steve Zissou,"" Anderson returns to those roots with ""The Darjeeling Limited."" Technically it's an Indian road trip movie, and it's full of his quirky charm... but at heart it's just about three unhapppy brothers with a lot of baggage. Both literally and psychologically.The forlorn Peter (Adrien Brody) and his luggage barely make it to an Indian train in time to join his brothers, woman-chasing writer Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and  bandaged control freak Francis (Owen Wilson). They haven't spoken for a year, and now they're planning to awkwardly bond as they travel to their estranged mother's convent.But after disasters involving a snake, painkillers and pepper spray, the three brothers find themselves (and their monogrammed suitcases) thrown off the train. As they trek back to civilization, the three men set out on a quest to explore the spiritual, deal with  life, death, feathers, man-eating tigers, funerals and their own painful memories... and possibly find their mom.Nobody in their right mind would expect Wes Anderson to spin up an ordinary good-ol'-boys road trip movie. At least, not the way most directors would. Instead, Anderson crafts this as the baby brother to ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" exploring a fractured, mildly dysfunctional family with an absent parent.And the cinematic flavour of ""Darjeeling Limited"" is much the same as in ""Royal Tenenbaums"" -- bittersweetly funny and arch, with a tinge of poetic melancholy underlying the plot. It would be an endearing movie in any setting, but somehow putting it in the mellow glow of India's dusty roads, bright fields and cluttered shrines makes it even better. The bright, visual richness gives it a sense of whimsy.For the record, Roman Coppola and Schwartzman helped Anderson out with the script, but there isn't much change. As always, lots of  wry, amusingly contemplative dialogue (""I wonder if the three of us would've been friends in real life. Not as brothers, but as people""), though there is some hilarious comedic scenes of sibling infighting. It even gets slapsticky.Fortunately, Anderson never puts artificial twists into the story, for any extra drama, comedy or thrills; the closest thing would be a brief detour into a child's funeral. The story simply flows by, because it's all about the brothers -- and focusing on anything but their self-imposed journey would just be extra baggage.And the three men playing Jack, Francis and Peter are nothing short of brilliant.

1127462,AQSQLWD3NLMAS,B0010X8NF0,Glenn A. Buttkus,"[2, 7]","THE DARJEELING LIMITED (2007)INSIGHTSEEING BY RAILWelcome all to ""Wes's World"", a tight knit group of friends and collaborators that closely resembles a vaudevillian family, a traveling troupe of players, writers, producers, and directors. Director Wes Anderson is the vertex, the hub that all others gravitate toward and hover around. On the strength of just five films in ten years, Anderson has created a cinematic niche, a new genre -the ""Wes Anderson Film"". His comic humanism has him compared to Francois Truffaut and Louis Malle. Early on Martin Scorsese became a fan, stating in an article for ESQUIRE that Anderson, ""Will become the next Scorsese"". He corralled young Wes and sat him down for a screening of Jean Renior's THE RIVER (1951). Anderson was inspired and set out to watch a lot of Indian cinema, especially those films of legendary director Satyajit Ray. He has stated that he made DARJEELING LIMITED (2007) as further proof of his fascination and inspiration. Further he dedicated the film to Ray's memory, and rather than having an original musical score done for the movie, he ""borrowed"" original music from several Indian films, including some of Satyajit Ray's.Now let's see -Roman Coppola, a buddy of Anderson's who is also brother to Sofia and son to Francis Ford, is a cousin to Jason Schwartzman, the star of Anderson's RUSHMORE (1998) and Schwartzman in a moustache is a dead ringer for Luke Wilson -who along with his brother Owen Wilson are frequent Anderson collaborators and compadres. Add Coppola's girlfriend, Jennifer Furches, along with Bill Murray and Anjelica Huston, and Ben Stiller -and we get a glimpse of the ""Wes Anderson Stock Company"". Many of the great filmmakers have done things this way, John Wayne learning how to do it from mentor John Ford, Clint Eastwood learning how to do it from mentor Don Siegel. After all an artist certainly can ""trust"" his friends, can be himself with them.Last year, after an inspiration from Anderson, Schwartzman and Coppola and the young maverick director boarded a train in India, and traveled for a month scouting locations for and writing the screenplay of THE DARJEELING LIMITED. Anderson claimed that part of the idea for writing about three brothers came from a John Cassavetes film, HUSBANDS (1970).""My main idea was not the train, not India, not the brothers,"" said Wes Anderson, ""My main idea was -I want to write with Jason and Roman.""So Schwartzman had an apartment in Rome, after filming Sofia Coppola's MARIE ANTONEITTE (2006). Wanting to get out of NYC after a decade there, Anderson came to Italy and ""crashed"" at Schwartzman's apartment. Then for a time he and Jason were roommates. During that period he pulled out his notebook and laid out the bare bones plot of DARJEELING LIMITED, and the movie was ""hatched on the spot"". They then recruited Roman, who lived there too, and there travels to India began.The plot of the film gave us the three Whitman brothers, Francis, Peter, and Jack, estranged for a year after their father's funeral, whom had been run down by a NYC taxi driver and met a gruesome untimely demise. The brothers were reunited in India, cajoled into coming by the eldest, Francis (Owen Wilson). Francis got his siblings to come by convincing them that this trip was their chance to reconnect as brothers, to be ""close -like we used to be."" The middle brother, Peter (Adrien Brody), joined them even though his wife was expecting their first child. He traveled wearing his father's oversized sunglasses, even though the prescription was wrong for him. Later we discover he is carrying the father's razor. All three boys carry their father's 11 pieces of ornate leather luggage, hand carved and expensive. The youngest brother, Jack (Jason Schwartzman), traveled shoeless and clueless, happy to be an aimless shiftless Lothario wherever he went. Days into the trip Francis revealed that mostly the point of their adventure would be to find and reunite with their mother (Anjelica Huston). She had not attended her husband's funeral because she ""didn't want to."" She had escaped to a remote part of India, to a convent temple, and was more than willing to completely give herself to Jesus, to a higher power, and care for dozens of ragamuffin orphans -but she had no time for her own prodigy, no time for the real world.I had come to see a Wes Anderson film -some kind of intellectual comedy that would be born out of sadness, a dysfunctional family struggling to function in an impartial world, something cleverly written, full of wry wit, absurdity, burlesque and vaudeville pranks and pratfalls, with characters who feel lost, consumed with their journeys that transport them first nowhere and then somewhere. After an hour of small smiles and tiny chuckles, enjoying and applauding Anderson's use of Marx Brother's manic moves, Three Stooges silliness, slow motion scenes, wide angle vistas, and a clever use of music -I suddenly found myself laughing aloud, and my cheeks were wet with tears. It happened somewhere in the story after the funeral of the drown child. This literary and cinematic territory, so wonderfully traveled in THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (2001) -was refined for this film, and better focused.  Inexplicably Wes Anderson found a way to touch my emotions, to pressure me into some semblance of identifying with the characters, those wealthy misfits, products of a fractured family; no mean feat for a blue collar kid like myself.For me this film is a book end, a companion piece to THE TENENBAUMS -two somewhat parallel related plots about privileged families, whose individual members all struggle with the lack of parental guidance and love, and struggle against the influence of parental neglect and absence in their lives; trapped in their situation, fighting for their freedom. This is certainly not a tight film, nor a perfect film, but its jagged edges-- colored and back dropped with the immensity and magic of Mother India, are miraculously pulled closer together as the boys ""let go of their baggage.""Glenn Buttkus 2007",4,Insightseeing by Rail,1196294400,"11 29, 2007",2007,6064,"['DARJEELING', 'LIMITED', '2007', 'INSIGHTSEEING', 'BY', 'RAILWelcome', 'Wes', 'World',

Well, except for when they bought that poisonous snake, maybe.. but basically they were likeable.Much of the story seemed to be taking place in Rajasthan, or along the lines of the middle north west (you won't see Darjeeling).

There is something exceedingly self confident about The Darjeeling Limited. The first scene features a chase to catch a train and the first of the three actors to appear is Adrien Brody.

1127470,A3TY1C8ZHY5THP,B0010X8NF0,"Inept Editor ""TheIneptOwl.com""","[2, 2]","The last Wes Anderson movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, was the one that began to elicit a few cries of lost magic from former die hard fans turned burnt out turncoats.  It was certainly the broadest reaching of his works, an episodic plot featuring turns including pirate attacks and what ultimately proved to be an untrue father-son reconciliation.The Darjeeling Limited has had its share of haven't-even-seen-it-yet detractors who also claim that Anderson has lost whatever it is he used to have.  Others have suggested that his work continues to show its seams to the audience, that it is a cinematic mad-lib of artistic cinematography combined with highly strategic music.I agree with pretty much everything about that line of thought towards the Anderson movies. He has shown himself by this point to be essentially a one-trick pony.  With the exception of his debut Bottle Rocket, his movies have dealt exclusively with the longings and emptiness of the lives of over-privileged white people, typically selfish yet endearing in a quirky way, with a soundtrack that was clearly planned before dialogue was even written, and apparently an appearance by Bill Murray and Angelica Houston.But the thing is, it works.  Perhaps I'm something of an apologist, because despite knowing all of the above, I still continually find myself sucked into the world he paints, I connect with his characters and I even find myself searching iTunes for the soundtrack.  And so it is safe to say Darjeeling Limited had me as soon as I was introduced to all three of its main characters, the Whitman brothers, played by Owen Wilson, Adrian Brody, and Jason Schwartzman, three rich American brothers riding a train across India.The Darjeeling Limited, despite it's road movie backdrop, is likely the smallest, most claustrophobic of Anderson's movies to date.  It maintains such a close portrait of its three main protagonists, who are so rarely separated from one another that even when the boys are kicked off the train for fighting, or the worlds apart the characters seem from each other at times, the movie never really feels like it leaves the close confines of their shared cabin.So while watching an Anderson film is an experience of familiarity with his previous works, to me it never comes off as redundant. It feels very much like looking at a series of paintings by the same artist during the same period of his life, looking deeply for a level of truth in slivers of the same image, with only a few slight variations, that when pondered more seem to make an immense difference.",5,Hop Aboard!

Alas we are very far from that because of the absolutely egocentric and self-centered psychologically claustrophobic closing up of each one of the three brothers onto each one of themselves. They hate themselves and one another with the greatest amount of love and yet they can't stand one another. They are looking for their mother who disappeared before their father's funeral they had to bury alone. She took refuge in some kind of Christian nunnery in India and she just does not hear the voices from her sons or from the world or from even herself. She is entirely locked up in an supposedly altruistic dedication to the poor of India and does not see she is selfishly rejecting her own responsibilities towards her own children and family. The spiritual pilgrimage of these three brothers becomes a nightmare when they have to travel together in a deluxe first class sleeper compartment on an Indian train and can't stand their mutual guts. They will eventually get themselves kicked off the train. But we miss all the spirituality of this country, this subcontinent, not to speak of the Hindu religion that is reduced to a poor series of worn-out clich&eacute;s.

Jason Schwartzman, who gets writing credits this time around, fills out the trio.  The movie drifts along at the pace you would expect from Anderson, less a travelogue of India than it is a clever study on fraternal relations.  We do get a spicy taste of India, replete with a splendid array of colors and a very touching sequence of events in an Indian village, not to mention another fun soundtrack drawing on the Kinks, Stones and even Joe Dassin.  The brothers finally do seem to reforge their bond, with an ironic wink.The DVD includes the all important ""Hotel Chevalier,"" cast in warm yellow tones, that is referred to throughout the film, underscored by Peter Sarstedt's wonderful ""Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)"".

After their father dies, Francis (Owen Wilson) organizes a trip for them to reconnect on a spiritual tour of India. So Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also acting as co-writer with director Wes Anderson) leaves behind the hotel room he's been living at for months in France and his neurotic girlfriend (Natalie Portman), and Peter (Adrien Brody) leaves his pregnant wife behind for the spiritual ""retreat."" Traveling around India on The Darjeeling Limited the three brothers try to find themselves, each other, and possibly their long lost mother (Anjelica Huston).Wes Anderson is the king of quirky indie style comedies. Before the indie movie scene was ""cool"", Anderson was making movies like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Often copied but never duplicated (the closest being Anderson protege Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale), one of the things that makes Anderson's movies so great is his ability to walk that fine line between depressing and funny, and pathetic and sweet. Writing satirical stories about dysfunctional relationships, neurotic individuals, and upperclass families unhinged from reality, Anderson has definitely carved himself a unique niche with the film world. So how does this film stand up against Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou?In all honesty, and this might be hard to believe, I think this is Anderson's best movie to date (I should say the best Anderson movie I've seen since I still have yet to see Fantastic Mr. Fox). By shooting this film in India, he gives this film a unique flavor from the rest of his films, while still seeming familiar at the same time. Of course, that familiarity can be attributed to Anderson's use of many of the same actors as he's used in his other films (of the American actors in the film, only Adrien Brody hasn't appeared in a Wes Anderson film), not to mention the familiar subject material from his previous movies. The smaller sets, and closer proximity of the characters, as well as the smaller cast also make this movie feel more personal and allowing you to get closer to the characters. One thing that I've noticed in a lot of indie films these days is giving characters quirks that don't really define the characters but are there just to set the movie apart from the mainstream. Here, Anderson's characters have quirks, but the quirks are defined by the characters relationships and who they are rather than the other way around. Throughout the movie we see Wilson's character with bandages covering a large portion of his head and face, it seems like it's just a quirk the writers threw in to make the character seem more interesting, but when you find out the truth, it makes complete since in the scheme of who the character is.As with any Anderson movie the acting is impeccable, and adding Oscar winner Adrien Brody to his film making ""family"" was an inspired choice. Each of the actors playing the brother is completely believable in his spot in the pecking order. Wilson as the oldest, and as the one who practically raised the other brothers, is authoritative to a fault and tries to hide a more emotional interior from his ""frailer"" brothers. Brody plays the middle brother who sometimes feels like he's fading stuck between the other two and tries to break out of the mold by taking things important to others to find an identity and at times rebels against his older brother. Schwartzman, as the younger brother, is the impressionable one but just kind of wants to go with the flow of what the other brothers are doing. Each actor exemplifies these roles to a tee, but the real standout is Wilson. Unfortunately, as we found out later, his character may have been a little closer to his reality then we'd like to have thought.If I had one problem with this movie it's that I don't get the use of Bill Murray as The Businessman with just one line. I guess had it been a no name actor I probably wouldn't have even thought about this point, and Anderson might have chosen to put Murray into this role because Murray's become something of a talisman to him since he has appeared in all of Anderson's movies except for Bottle Rocket. Still, because of Murray's involvement I kept thinking there was going to be something more to the movie that never came about. Due to this distraction from the rest of the movie, I find the role actually to be somewhat detrimental to the movie as it really serves no purpose in the grand scheme of things.I highly recommend that you give this movie a try, especially if you like Anderson's previously efforts or other independent film. As with all of his movies this is kind of a love it or hate it affair, but there's a lot to like about this movie from the look at a different culture, to the acting, to an interesting and engrossing story. Also if you check out the DVD make sure you watch the short film before The Darjeeling Limited called Hotel Chevalier.4.5/5",4,The Darjeeling Limited,1264809600,"01 30, 2010",2010,4988,"['Whitman',

1127482,A3RB6NQOLOBXYD,B0010X8NF0,"Jimmy Lee ""James""","[3, 11]","I intentionally delayed viewing this film for awhile as Wes Anderson's previous films failed to impress or satisfy me, more notably with The Royal Tenebaums and The Life Aquatic. Unfortunately, this film also fails miserably to redeem Wes Anderon's filmography; moreover, it only reinforces how out of touch Wes Anderson's writing has been with regard to his innate ability for crafting likable characters.Personally, my two favorite Wes Anderson films (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore) which I am sure are also popular beloved favorites among Wes Anderson fans like myself excelled in bringing fictional characters to life; characters that were incredibly distinct, unique and special; characters that were so flawed but nonetheless had many qualities that was so likable; characters that you could easily relate to but not entirely understand. Wes Anderson was truly an artist in bringing these types of characters to life because he knew exactly how to render them likable and so interesting. Personally, I felt that any writer who can craft someone purely fictional but leave an audience with an intense desire to follow that character through more interactions is a highly talented one. Wes Anderson fully succeeded with this task in his first two installments. I mean is it really necessary to express how much replay value Bottle Rocket or Rushmore possess within each viewing ?In this little mishap, Wes Anderson takes us to India where the Whitman Brothers rendezvous on a train, ""The darjeeling Limited"" , to embark on a spiritual journey since it has been a year seeing each other after their father's funeral. This journey was planned by Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) and even goes as far as to the trouble of creating an organized itinerary. The two other brothers, Peter Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack Whitman, (Jason Schrwatzman) do not seem as enthusiastic but comply with Francis's wishes nonetheless. Francis, who appears in the entire film covered with overwhelming but comically placed bandages is recovering from a serious motorcycle accident, meanwhile, Peter has left his 7 1/2 month pregnant wife back at home without telling her where he has gone. Finally, Jack, a novelist, who incessantly attempts to reconnect with an ex-girlfriend (Natalie Portman) but cannot seem to tone down his propensities for non-attached flings seems to struggle with many emotional dilemmas. Along this spiritual journey, Francis reveals to his two brothers another motive for this journey to which they express utter disappointment at first when Francis discloses to them that he wants to reunite with their estranged mother (Angelica Houston) in the Himalayas. She is apparently running a convent there.This film came across as a lazy, watered down, imposter Wes Anderson without all the bells and whistles. Nothing seemed genuine at all in the film. All of the positive and stand out qualities that were so prevalent in previous Wes Anderson films were just downright diluted in this one or carelessly non-existent. The Indian setting that may seem appropriate for the mournful spiritual journey was not at all interesting nor inviting. The characters were incredibly dull, wooden and just plain boring, nor did any of the characters have any particular uniqueness that was worth noting either. The chemistry among the characters was essentially non-existent and that is probably because all of them were exactly the same. Like another reviewer on here who also expressed his discontent with the film in its entirety by asking the same question I asked too at the end of the film, ""Who Cares"" ? I found myself caring less and less about the characters as the film dragged on it's slow, empty and very unfulfilling journey. Quite frankly, there was not one ounce of spirit in this film except maybe in the soundtrack/score which was also not one of Wes Anderson's finest choice. Looking back at this film in particular as well as Wes Anderson's other previous disappointments, I can't help but to feel a sort of arrogance spawning out of the once rejuvenating director of indie films. According to Wes Anderson, an unusual setting, dull characters with zero depth but a dash of quirkiness is just enough to attract new fans and retain the old ones. Wrong.  It appears Bottle Rocket and Rushmore will remain at the pinnacle of Mr. Anderson catalog until he finds his true self again or finds a new career.",2,Diminishing Returns for the Wes Anderson Catalog,1322352000,"11 27, 2011",2011,4403,"['intentionally', 'delayed', 'viewing', 'film', 'awhile', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'previous', 'films', 'failed', 'impress', 'satisfy', 'more', 'notably', 'Royal', 'Tenebaums', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'also', 'miserably', 'redeem', 'Wes', 'Anderon', 'filmography', 'moreover', 'only', 'how', 'touch', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'writing', 'been', 'regard', 'innate', 'ability', 'crafting', 'likable', 'characters.Personally', 'two', 'favorite', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'am', 'sure', 'are', 'also', 'popular', 'beloved', 'favorites', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fans', 'excelled', 'bringing', 'fictional', 'characters', 'life', 'characters', 'were', 'incredibly', 'distinct', 'unique', 'special', 'characters', 'were', 'so', 'flawed', 'nonetheless', 'had', 'many', 'qualities', 'was', 'so', 'likable', 'characters', 'could', 'easily', 'relate', 'not', 'entirely', 'understand', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'was', 'truly', 'artist', 'bringing', 'types', 'characters', 'life', 'knew', 'exactly', 'how', 'render', 'likable', 'so', 'interesting', 'Personally', 'felt', 'writer', 'who', 'can', 'craft', 'someone', 'purely', 'fictional', 'leave', 'audience', 'intense', 'desire', 'follow', 'character', 'more', 'interactions', 'highly', 'talented', 'one', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fully', 'succeeded', 'task', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'mean', 'really', 'necessary', 'express', 'how', 'much', 'replay', 'value', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'possess', 'viewing', 'little', 'mishap', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'India', 'where', 'Whitman', 'Brothers', 'rendezvous', 'train', 'darjeeling', 'Limited', 'embark', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'been', 'year', 'seeing', 'other', 'father', 'funeral', 'journey', 'was', 'planned', 'Francis', 'Whitman', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'even', 'as', 'far', 'trouble', 'creating', 'organized', 'itinerary', 'two', 'other', 'brothers', 'Peter', 'Whitman', 'Adrian', 'Brody', 'Jack', 'Whitman', 'Jason', 'Schrwatzman', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'enthusiastic', 'comply', 'Francis', 'wishes', 'nonetheless', 'Francis', 'who', 'entire', 'film', 'covered', 'overwhelming', 'comically', 'placed', 'bandages', 'recovering', 'serious', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'meanwhile', 'Peter', 'left', '7', '1/2', 'month', 'pregnant', 'wife', 'back', 'home', 'telling', 'where', 'gone', 'Finally', 'Jack', 'novelist', 'who', 'incessantly', 'reconnect', 'ex-girlfriend', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'tone', 'down', 'propensities', 'non-attached', 'flings', 'struggle', 'many', 'emotional', 'dilemmas', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'Francis', 'two', 'brothers', 'motive', 'journey', 'express', 'utter', 'disappointment', 'first', 'when', 'Francis', 'reunite', 'estranged', 'mother', 'Angelica', 'Houston', 'Himalayas', 'apparently', 'running', 'convent', 'there.This', 'film', 'came', 'lazy', 'watered', 'down', 'imposter', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'bells', 'whistles', 'Nothing', 'seemed', 'genuine', 'film', 'positive', 'stand', 'out', 'qualities', 'were', 'so', 'prevalent', 'previous', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'films', 'were', 'just', 'downright', 'diluted', 'one', 'carelessly', 'non-existent', 'Indian', 'setting', 'may', 'seem', 'appropriate', 'mournful', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'was', 'not', 'interesting', 'inviting', 'characters', 'were', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'wooden', 'just', 'plain', 'boring', 'did', 'characters', 'have', 'particular', 'uniqueness', 'was', 'worth', 'noting', 'either', 'chemistry', 'characters', 'was', 'essentially', 'non-existent', 'probably', 'were', 'exactly', 'same', 'reviewer', 'here', 'who', 'also', 'expressed', 'discontent', 'film', 'entirety', 'asking', 'same', 'question', 'asked', 'too', 'end', 'film', 'Who', 'found', 'caring', 'less', 'less', 'characters', 'film', 'dragged', 'slow', 'empty', 'very', 'unfulfilling', 'journey', 'Quite', 'frankly', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'ounce', 'spirit', 'film', 'maybe', 'soundtrack/score', 'was', 'also', 'not', 'one', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'finest', 'choice', 'Looking', 'back', 'film', 'particular', 'as', 'well', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'other', 'previous', 'disappointments', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sort', 'arrogance', 'spawning', 'once', 'rejuvenating', 'director', 'indie', 'films', 'According', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'unusual', 'setting', 'dull', 'characters', 'zero', 'depth', 'dash', 'quirkiness', 'just', 'enough', 'attract', 'new', 'fans', 'retain', 'old', 'ones', 'Wrong', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'will', 'remain', 'pinnacle', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'catalog', 'true', 'self', 'again', 'new', 'career']",N/A

1127487,A34D06JL7LC6MU,B0010X8NF0,"Joshua Miller ""Josh""","[0, 0]","The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's fifth film as a director and his fifth film to enter the Criterion Collection. Like all of Anderson's films, some may instantly fall in love with it while others will be rendered perplexed by what the hype is about. I fall somewhere in the middle of those, despite the fact that I consider myself a fan of Wes Anderson having liked all of his movies and having a certain fondness for his quirky, minimalist style. With that said, I'm polarized by The Darjeeling Limited as there's so much to like about it and little that I actually do.The film follows Francis (Owen Wilson), Paul (Adrien Brody), and Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also a co-writer), three brothers who haven't spoken in the year following their father's death. They meet each other on the Darjeeling Limited, a train traveling through India.There is a plot, but not much actually happens in the film. It progresses with the character's, who ride atop Anderson's style like a wave. The plot isn't the film's focal point; it's about character, tone, and style. Anderson has been criticized for valuing style over substance in the past, but this is one of the only films I've seen by the man where I felt compelled to use that criticism. While this is all perception as there are established relationships and/or scenes that may connect with someone on an emotional level, for me, The Darjeeling Limited never transcends something that's dryly humorous and pretty to look at.It's a colorful film that's vibrant, alive, and fun to look at. It uses India as the landscape, but it isn't India so much as it is Anderson's India. The art direction is splendid and transforms India into a world of whimsical fantasy. It's also blessed with brilliant cinematography by Robert Yeoman, who seems to treat each scene like a separate photograph. There is no original score and the film consists mostly of Indian music (some of it lifted from the films of Satyajit Ray) and, as I've come to expect from Anderson, the occasional Rolling Stones song. The score of Anderson's films tend to blend perfectly with his filmmaking style, but his choice of songs throughout the film complement his style just as perfectly as well as capturing the time and place more effectively.The three principal actors give perfectly low-key performances, as well as capturing the chemistry necessary to actually convey that they're brothers. Brody, Wilson, and Schwartzman have a nice rapport with each other that is very convincing. Famed director Barbet Schroeder has a small role as does Anjelica Huston, although her role is much larger in the schemes of things just not in actual screen-time. In addition, Anderson regular Bill Murray makes a cameo rushing as a businessman rushing to catch his train in the opening scene. Anderson's unique, wry sense of humor is present throughout and it works as a result of being perfectly in tune with his actors. There are some scenes and lines of dialogue that may make you think Anderson invented the art of subtlety, as they sneak in so quietly they may go completely over your head.Some of Anderson's films are less accessible than others and The Darjeeling Limited may be one of those films. Those familiar with his style will be pleased, if not completely thrilled...But those new to Anderson may be perplexed and confused by it. I'm not new to Anderson and I was even a bit perplexed by it. It's not a great film, but besides my gripe with its preference of style over substance, there are no obvious flaws; it just never reveals itself as a great film. Perhaps, like many Criterion titles, it takes time to absorb it and multiple viewings to appreciate it; but The Darjeeling Limited lacks a certain sincerity and coherency for me, which seems essential for a film dealing with such complex human emotions.The 13-minute short film that precedes the film is Hotel Chevalier, starring Schwartzman and Natalie Portman, which is simply about Jack's former lover unexpectedly arriving at his hotel in Paris. I haven't read too much acclaim for this short and few mention it except to say that it fills in some information left unexplained in the film, but I found this poignant, minimalistic short superb. Hotel Chevalier has style and substance in perfect harmony, with Anderson managing to express so much with so little. Relying on very short, vague dialogue and the two actor's facial expressions; Anderson succeeds at conveying some pretty complex emotions in a very artistic, poetic, and lovely way. Even as a stand-alone short, Hotel Chevalier is something special and highly overlooked.The new 2-disc Criterion DVD is a lovely addition to the Criterion catalogue and there's not a complaint to be had about it. It has exactly what you'd expect from a Criterion release including the film, the short film, and enough bonus features to keep the most ardent lover of this film happy for several hours. And, of course the artwork by Eric Chase Anderson looks terrific as usual. If you like this movie and you own the previous edition, you may find this Criterion version worth picking up.THE DARJEELING LIMITED: B-HOTEL CHEVALIER: A-CRITERION RELEASE: A",4,"A Great Release of a

I have mostly liked Wes Anderson's previous films, though I have found many of the characters or attitudes seemingly promoted in them rather repulsive. It's much the same here, except that this time there was nothing I found truly positive or endearing, as was the case in, say, Rushmore or in particular The Royal Tenenbaums -- or more recently, Moonrise Kingdom. In Darjeeling Limited, in fact, I found none of the major characters endearing at all, and only a few of the supporting ones. What don't I like about these people? Their apparent self-absorption and narcissism, their irresponsible attitudes and -- to be prudish -- their addiction to smoking. (In passing, I have to say that it's one of the major irritants to watching a Wes Anderson film: His apparent desire to glamorize a silly, stupid and destructive addiction that some people indulge in seemingly for the pretentious reason that it makes them feel creative and rebellious. What adolescent crap. But I digress....) There is some gorgeous photography, nice editing, and snippets of smart writing, but it's all too self-conscious and conceited for my tastes. I grant that Anderson touches upon meaningful issues of family and loss and belonging, but by now he now seems to do it in a repetitive, formulaic and quirky manner rather than with a varied, novel and thoughtful approach. What we get here are weaker and weaker echoes of prevous films.

The tired pseudo-spirituality jokes and, especially, the boring and pointless 1st part which was made so that Wes could spend a week in Paris with Portman - help this film to tank utterly and completely.The India shown in DL is not the real India but an edited-into-oblivion, fantasized and disemboweled version of it. Nor do we see real Indians but rather bleached, sanitized non-entities, some (like the lovely Rita maid character) with a London accent.The only redeeming point here (in addition to the iPod gags) is the cinematography set into the beautiful landscapes of Rajasthan.

The Darjeeling Limited itself is quite exotic and colorful, and provides us a unique look at train travel in India.  Additionally, native citizens of India are used throughout the film, which adds weight to the authentic feel. However lovely, though, the plot and character development are things left to be desired.The plot is a rambling stream of consciousness that barely held my interest at the time, and, in retrospect, wasn't that interesting after all.  The character development is thin at best, leaving the audience scratching their proverbial heads as to who these people are, how they are related, and why we should care. (Eventually you get it, but it takes far too long.)  The acting is passable but predictable:  Owen Wilson is a jerk and drives his family nuts, Adrien Brody just looks depressed and brow beaten, and Jason Schwartzman has no depth whatsoever as the youngest, skirt chasing brother.I didn't love it and I didn't hate it.

1127499,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0010X8NF0,Lee Armstrong,"[5, 24]","Wes Anderson became famous to me when he did a credit card commercial with a car blowing up.  It played endlessly and was interesting.  ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" was really very boring and awful for me.  It didn't spark.  It wasn't funny.  ""Darjeeling Limited"" is much like that film.  Anderson was nominated for an Oscar along with Owen Wilson for ""The Royal Tenenbaums.""  He won a ""Best Original Screenplay"" award for this film with Jason Schwartzman from New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed having much of the film set in India.  It gave it a mystical quality.  The featurette on the DVD was interesting to watch how they used Indian artists to paint the train and all of the symbolic meaning to the pictures that one doesn't focus upon within the context of the film.The reason this film didn't work for me was that while it seemed to be trying to go in different directions at the same time, one of those was comedy.  Owen Wilson's Francis had no serious level to his characterization; neither was he funny.  He had energy and was interesting, but seemed mostly odd.  Jason Schwartzman who is the son of Talia Shire from the Rocky movies was most interesting in the short ""The Hotel Chevalier.""  However, while Natalie Portman's lack of dress was interesting, the short prologue film was open-ended with no sense of climax.  Schwartzman's Jack was a self-centered rich kid with hormones.  It seemed like he was playing a sad sack brand of comedy, but it wasn't funny.  Adrien Brody was simply in the wrong movie at the wrong time.  He spent much of his time as Peter wandering around in boxer shorts, abandoning his pregnant wife over issues of commitment.  Perhaps the most interesting thing in the film is when he admits that he got married with the idea that they'd get divorced.  Amara Karan does a nice job as the train's hostess Rita who balances a relationship with the Chief Steward played by Waris Ahluwalia.  These characters brought a sense of story to the film as we seemed to drop in on their relationship at a critical point.  Angelica Huston won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for ""Prizzi's Honor"" in 1985.  She was inexplicable in this film, abandoning her kids to help a remote village, not going to her husband's funeral, and then disappearing before anything was resolved.  While the other actors seemed to be trying to be funny, Huston was decidedly dramatic, adding to the completely disjointed feel of the film.  Wallace Wolodarsky who was in ""Life Aquatic"" and played Brandon seemed very ordinary.  I did enjoy the two busybody German ladies played by Trudy Mathis & Margot Godros.  They were funny.

The makers of this film could have made a '60's style spiritual/social commentary, but opted to drop the ball, so to speak, and smugly leave us hanging without explanation.  It IS self explanatory, but the film makers leave too much to our imagination to do.  In this film, three self centered weenies go in search of--at first, or so the oldest brother of the three tells them--a spiritual quest.  Secretly, he's got them together to search for their mother who's ""dropped out"" (or IN, from her persective).  I sat for 50 minutes enduring their sad seeker baloney--and they're obviously vapid, rich jerks, plonked down in one of the poorer countries of the world (India)--traveling along aboard the train called the Darjeeling Limited.  Adrien Brody does have a moment to shine, and it's when the TRUE spiritual moment of the film happens (SPOILER ALERT) as he and his brothers save two of three boys who've fallen off their raft into a rapid river.  Now, a point can be made here, IF you believe in this sort of thing; they were in the right place at the right time--and THAT is what they should have acknowledged.  Yet, they go back to being vapid, spoiled drifters.  Still, even since the film makers didn't acknowledge that, other than visually, it still SAYS SOMETHING.  BUT, I think they were too involved in making something on the order of ""Easy Rider"" (with doofuses) and shot the message in the foot by wasting our time with the rest of it.  Their ""apology"" (IMHO) was in a scene near the end--a fellini moment--where the camera pans through each compartment of the train, including Bill Murray and the Tiger, as if to say;""we're all on a journey through life, it may seem futile, but we're ALL together while doing it"".  In making this 1960's style statement, I might admire, if it weren't for the fact that the 1960's were NO FUN.  Assasinations, war, & civil unrest made it all a turnmoil.  A few good movies commented on this.

There's lots of action, drama, comedy and suspense in this film--it grabbed my attention and it never let go until the very end. The cinematography and the choreography were brilliantly done; and the acting was very convincing. The plot moves along at a good pace although I suppose they could have cut a couple of minutes here or there; but that is a minor issue.When the action starts, three estranged brothers who haven't even spoken for a year get together in India for what one of them, Francis L. Whitman (Owen Wilson), says is a spiritual journey so that they can connect again. Francis and his two brothers Peter L. Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack L. Whitman (Jason Schwartzman) all have unresolved issues. Nevertheless, they all meet just as Francis tells them to and they begin their journey across India on a train called The Darjeeling Limited.The character quirks make them so human, too. Francis is the control freak who even hires an assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky) to make laminated daily ""itineraries"" so that every moment is structured. Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice from whom he simply ""expects"" to divorce someday; and Jack is estranged from his former girlfriend. Jack can't get her off his mind; we see that in the introduction to the movie when Jack and his ex (Natalie Portman) are alone together and later on in the actual film when he keeps checking her answering machine to monitor her incoming messages.Unfortunately, however, the brothers pick up a snake and when the snake gets loose the train conductor isn't exactly happy about having a snake onboard the train. The brothers alienate themselves even further from the train conductor when one of them accidentally breaks a glass window--the brothers go from being confined to their cabins to getting kicked off the train! Then the REAL adventure begins--they continue their journey. On their way, they find three boys drowning; and sadly they can only save two of the three young boys. The funeral for the dead youth immediately brings back memories of their father's funeral one year earlier.But there's still more. Their mother, Patricia Whitman (Anjelica Huston), has run off to be a nun. When Francis finally tells his brothers that the real reason they're in India is to find their mother and ask her why she wasn't at their father's funeral Peter and Jack feel very uncertain about things.Do they get to see their mother--and, if they do, how will that go? She might not want to see them. There's also a man-eating tiger about; will that cause these three men any danger? And what about their own issues of sibling rivalry--how will those feelings be dealt with when the brothers are together on this long journey? Will there be a problem when Jack has some romantic time alone with Rita (Amara Karan), the stewardess on The Darjeeling Limited? Watch and find out!The DVD has a featurette on the making of the film entitled The Darjeeling Limited: Walking Tour; and the music is very pretty.The Darjeeling Limited is an outstanding film that hits home with spot on performances by great actors. The people in this film could be taking this type of trip just about anywhere and at just about any point in time; it's truly about emotions, sibling relationships, relationships between adult children and their parents and the realities of life and death.

It showed a side of India that are less often seen, particularly since much of the movie involves a long train trip, and most of the rest, an unplanned excursion in the desert (the area around Jaipur).The story line involves three brothers, apparently wealthy, who don't get along. The father, we learn, is deceased, and the mother has vanished from their lives. The family is dysfunctional and the brothers aren't doing so well as individuals, either. The oldest, who tends to be very controlling, put together this trip as a time for spiritual renewal and healing for the family. They are to meet on a train, the Darjeeling Limited, to go visit their mother, who has moved to India. Their behavior is so bad that they are soon asked to leave the train, and then they meet up with some locals.A couple of things bothered me, however. The first was the lack of subtlety -- all traits and messages were writ large, lest you miss them. The controlling nature of the oldest brother is broadly exaggerated (he takes the passports to make sure no-one loses them or leaves without his permission; in the dining car, without asking, he orders for each of them). The symbolism of the final scene (POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS.......................................................................................................they catch the train but leave all their expensive baggage behind them) is ridiculously obvious -- what we're supposed to see as the personal growth that these horrible brothers experienced.

Just like the movie we all had to face each other as people changed by time and tragedy and find that we dislike each other greatly but find out inevitably that we are unbreakable in our love for each other because we are family. And, oh yes just like the brothers in the movie, we were smoking in my father's garage because cleaning a flooded-out house just sucks the breath out of you.It is to me one of the most well-crafted, well assembled and visually appealing movies to date. I have always like Wes Andersen since the World Aquatic with Steve Zissou. He has a way of manipulating visual atmosphere and arranging scenes with spare dialogue making it richer without overcrowding it. He is a whole new style on his own while somehow borrowing from the past.

Motivated to bond with his brothers after a near-fatal accident, Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) arranges a trip to India for himself and brothers Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). The idea is make a ""spiritual journey"" of a cross-country train trip aboard The Darjeeling Limited, following a careful, laminated itinerary. But the brothers don't trust one another, for good reason, and Francis has kept their destination a secret.The Darjeeling Limited is a functional train created for this movie, which was filmed aboard the moving train. There couldn't be a better advertisement for Indian tourism. The train is absolutely charming, with handpainted artwork adorning the corridors, colorful, tasseled chandeliers in the dining car, and a profusion of lovely cobalt blue everywhere. I have no idea if this remotely resembles a real Indian train. It seems like an exotic, whimsical version of a European train from the pre-World War II era. But the production design by Mark Friedberg is a true gem, not to be missed.""The Darjeeling Limited"" has a low-key, slightly bemused, wryly comic, but good-natured tone, to which I attribute its success. It's familiar, but I have never seen a film able to sustain this tone for the duration. It doesn't slip even as the characters' situation vacillates from comic to tragic, or when they get off the train. Even the humor doesn't interrupt the flow, which is aided by a great soundtrack. I found it all pleasantly hypnotic. The visuals are beautiful. The odd characters seem utterly natural in this environment. This is the best role for Adrien Brody since ""The Pianist"". Wes Anderson's films are hit-or-miss for me, but this one is a hit.The DVD (20th Century Fox 2008): You have the option of viewing the film with a prelude entitled ""Hotel Chevalier"" (12 min). It concerns an encounter between Jack and his girlfriend in a Paris hotel room. It's superfluous and would create a hiccough in the film's pacing. I strongly recommend viewing the film without it. You can always watch it afterward. There is also a making-of featurette called ""The Darjeeling Limited Walking Tour"" (21 min). Production designer Mark Friedberg shows us around the train, and there is behind-the-scenes footage of filming. And there is a theatrical trailer (2 min).

All of the actors gave good performances but the characters they were portraying weren't interesting in anyway. The look of the movie overall was good but again the story that was unfolding within the interesting looking picture was not interesting or entertaining in anyway.The Bad: The story/plot is terrible and from the start I was asking myself ""why am I watching this"" coupled with ""why do I care"" and the answers were simple. The DVD was already there and I didn't care. The characters were all ludicrous and that combined with a terrible story leaves nothing redeeming.Overall: This might be worth a rental just to see Natalie Portman in the short ""Hotel Chevalier"" but there isn't anything else worth watching.

1127518,A2TX79GR278JMA,B0010X8NF0,P. Opus,"[1, 2]","Wes Andersen is probably my favorite director right now but I understand that his films are not for everyone.  His unique and highly personal body of work seems to have a polarizing effect on audiences.  They typical reactions are either ""brilliant"" or ""slow-moving.""  Most of his films revolve around a close look at family drama among dysfunctional adults, with a dry, quiet humor that takes some getting used to.  It's leagues away from your typical American ""Meet The Fockers""-style slapstick comedy, in other words it attempts to provoke thought rather than belly laughs.The main criticism I would levy upon Wes Andersen's career trajectory is his tendency to essentially explore the same themes again and again in the same way - characters who are dysfunctional misfits coming together and making some sense of life.  The Royal Tennenbaums is the most successful of these films to date, with Darjeeling a close second.What makes Darjeeling work is the pairing of an imposed, forced spiritual journey with a real one that occurs when the characters are tested by true hardships.  Owen Wilson's character, the de facto ringleader of the three estranged brothers, has called them together in an attempt to rekindle their brotherly relationship via a journey through India.  He manages to convince the other brothers to participate in hokey activities designed to enlighten them spiritually, but that attempt fails horribly when it is derailed by reality.  However it is that reality - facing someone's death, possible maternal distinterest and a sense of futility that applies to the whole journey - that forces the brothers to really examine their lives and shed the baggage that they have both literally and figuratively been dragging around behind them for the duration of the film.  Far from being obtuse, the themes are obvious and clear - and the film succeeds for that reason.So a qualified but high recommendation - if your tastes veer towards subtle humor and somewhat self-conscious (or self-parodying?) artistry, this film could be a meaningful experience for you as it was for me.",5,Quietly rewarding,1205798400,"03 18, 2008",2008,2095,"['Wes', 'Andersen', 'probably', 'favorite', 'director', 'right', 'now', 'understand', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'everyone', 'unique', 'highly', 'personal', 'body', 'work', 'have', 'polarizing', 'effect', 'audiences', 'typical', 'reactions', 'are', 'brilliant', 'slow-moving', 'Most', 'films', 'revolve', 'close', 'look', 'family', 'drama', 'dysfunctional', 'adults', 'dry', 'quiet', 'humor', 'getting', 'used', 'leagues', 'away', 'typical', 'American', 'Meet', 'Fockers', '-style', 'slapstick', 'comedy', 'other', 'words', 'provoke', 'thought', 'rather', 'belly', 'laughs.The', 'main', 'criticism', 'would', 'levy', 'Wes', 'Andersen', 'career', 'trajectory', 'tendency', 'essentially', 'explore', 'same', 'themes', 'again', 'again', 'same', 'way', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'dysfunctional', 'misfits', 'coming', 'together', 'making', 'sense', 'life', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaums', 'most', 'successful', 'films', 'date', 'Darjeeling', 'close', 'second.What', 'Darjeeling', 'work', 'pairing', 'imposed', 'forced', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'real', 'one', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'tested', 'true', 'hardships', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'character', 'de', 'facto', 'ringleader', 'three', 'estranged', 'brothers', 'called', 'together', 'attempt', 'rekindle', 'brotherly', 'relationship', 'journey', 'India', 'convince', 'other', 'brothers', 'participate', 'hokey', 'activities', 'designed', 'enlighten', 'spiritually', 'attempt', 'horribly', 'when', 'derailed', 'reality', 'However', 'reality', 'facing', 'someone', 'death', 'possible', 'maternal', 'distinterest', 'sense', 'futility', 'whole', 'journey', 'brothers', 'really', 'examine', 'lives', 'shed', 'baggage', 'have', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'been', 'dragging', 'around', 'duration', 'film', 'Far', 'being', 'obtuse', 'themes', 'are', 'obvious', 'clear', 'film', 'qualified', 'high', 'recommendation', 'tastes', 'veer', 'towards', 'subtle', 'humor', 'somewhat', 'self-conscious', 'self-parodying', 'artistry', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'meaningful', 'experience', 'was']",N/A

It is quiet comedy, reflection on American consumerism, meditation on meaning of family and quest for spirituality.  We meet three brothers who have not seen each other for a year, since the funeral for their father who died in a car accident.  Their mother never comes to the funeral and for all of the brothers this event seems to be a culmination of the prolonged family disfunction.  They are almost like boy-men who cope with their inadequacy in their own way:  eldest one (Francis - Owen) almost kills himself in motorcycle accident, middle one (Peter - Brody) collects material things: his deceased father's glasses, keys, belt; while the youngest one, a pretentious writer who speakes poor French in spite of living in Paris (Jack - Schwartsman) sleeps with anything that is female and still moving.  I like the metaphor that director Wes Anderson uses for the brothers.  They travel across beautiful Indian landscape with so much luggage that they require three porters and a car to carry it.  The luggage itself is no less but Louis Vuitton designed by Mark Jacobs.  As the film progresses and comes to its closure, all three manage to release themselves from the baggage and their dysfunctions turn into sincere brotherly love for each other.  They no longer need to medicate themselves with cigarettes, Indian caugh drops and pain killers.  They have each other and they finally trust each other.  Wonderful cast, music and scenery.  Film moves slowly and has fragments that connect past with the character's present.

He certainly likes to make fun of the human condition, as well as foibles and short-comings which are, let's face it, amusing. I disagree with most of the other reviews, but all I can say is that I think Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson presented very individual agendas. Wilson as the control freak annoyed me for a while, until a bigger picture developed. I was entertained and amused, and ""The Darjeeling Limited"" was everything I would expect from a Wes Anderson film. The appearance of Anjelica Huston toward the end was accompanied by a Rolling Stones tune, which made you believe that these guys had found what they were looking for.Wes Anderson is not simplistic; indeed, I was moved and never bored by this episodic adventure. I love his choice of music. The DVD extras were few, but included ""Hotel Chevalier"", a sort of preface to Jack's character (Schwartzman), with Natalie Portman (not in the actual film).

1127524,A3VO8JQT6LVXZ1,B0010X8NF0,Richard Ross,"[1, 1]","""The Darjeeling Limited"" tells the story of the Whitman brothers: Francis (Owen Wilson), Jack (Jason Schwartzman), and Peter (Adrien Brody). The brothers haven't spoken since their father's funeral and each one finds himself at a crossroads. Francis has just attempted suicide by crashing his motorcycle into a cliff. Peter and Jack's problems are with the women in their life. Peter is about to be a father and he is terrified at the prospect. Jack can't let a girl (Natalie Portman) who treats him like crap go. Francis brings his brothers together for a train ride through India aboard the Darjeeling Limited. He hopes that the trip will  allow them to be brothers again. The combined effects of years of not trusting one another, Jack getting too friendly with the help, overusing prescription medications, or bringing a lethal snake on board get the boys thrown off the train and stranded in the middle of nowhere with tons of luggage and a laminating machine. As they continue their journey by foot they stumble into a village where  tragedy  strikes that changes each of them for good. The acting is exceptional with Adrien Brody as the standout. His character is the one who gets a real wake up call in the village and the way he  plays these scenes is just beautiful. Wilson, whose own suicide attempt marred this film's promotion, does a sad and funny job of balancing the wild man aspects that cant' hide the deep loneliness and sadness that Francis feels. Schwartzman, who co-wrote the screenplay with his cousin Roman Coppola, and Anderson, gives a very mature performance as a heartbroken young man who manages to find a new romance aboard  the train. His rebound fling with the stewardess Sweet Lime is very sweet to watch. The script is perfect at capturing all the pain and regret that the brothers have been coping with but also coming up with bizarre and hilarious adventures for them to get caught up in. There is a lot of truth in the writing that makes you wonder how much of the script comes from real life events between the three men. Coppola lost his older brother young, Schwartzman's father died, and Anderson's brother is a frequent collaborator on his films. Anderson's brilliant use of music works to great effect here unearthing such gems from the Kinks and The Stones as well as using a lot of great world music as well. These songs, especially during the funeral in the village, the boy's reunion with their mother (Anjelica Huston), or the final shot of the boys trying to catch their train are pure poetry.  Some people have complained that the symbolism towards the end where the boys let go of all of their baggage before hopping the train home is a bit heavy handed but if you're going to get hung up on a point like that you've  completely missed the point of the film. My only complaint with the DVD is that I wish the extras were more substantive. This film begs for a Criterion release complete with an in depth making of and a couple of commentaries: one from the stars, the other from the writers. What we do get is a Walking Tour that is supposed to serve as a behind the scenes but that doesn't have any interviews. The other bonus feature, and at least it's a good one, is the short film ""Hotel Chevalier"". Despite featuring a super sexy and nearly nude Natalie Portman it serves as the back story for Jack. It explains why he can't let a wild woman like this go and sets up all of his hangups with women. True fans of the film can only hope that Criterion will do this film justice some day. Despite a disappointing selection of extras this film alone is  jam packed. There are moments where you're  laughing out loud and then in a matter of minutes you're fighting back tears. It's  a beautiful film visually and emotionally.  For the first time in a long time I can agree with Peter Travers who declares on the front of the DVD ""I love this movie. More than one of the year's best films.""",4,"One magical, emotional, and rewarding film",1204934400,"03 8, 2008",2008,3939,"['Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'story', 'Whitman', 'brothers', 'Francis', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jack', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Peter', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'brothers', 'have', ""n't"", 'spoken', 'father', 'funeral', 'one', 'crossroads', 'Francis', 'just', 'attempted', 'suicide', 'crashing', 'motorcycle', 'cliff', 'Peter', 'Jack', 'problems', 'are', 'women', 'life', 'Peter', 'be', 'father', 'terrified', 'prospect', 'Jack', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'girl', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'crap', 'go', 'Francis', 'brothers', 'together', 'train', 'ride', 'India', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'trip', 'will', 'allow', 'be', 'brothers', 'again', 'combined', 'effects', 'years', 'not', 'trusting', 'one', 'Jack', 'getting', 'too', 'friendly', 'help', 'overusing', 'prescription', 'medications', 'bringing', 'lethal', 'snake', 'board', 'get', 'boys', 'thrown', 'off', 'train', 'stranded', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'tons', 'luggage', 'laminating', 'machine', 'continue', 'journey', 'foot', 'stumble', 'village', 'where', 'tragedy', 'changes', 'good', 'acting', 'exceptional', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'standout', 'character', 'one', 'who', 'real', 'wake', 'up', 'call', 'village', 'way', 'scenes', 'just', 'beautiful', 'Wilson', 'own', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'marred', 'film', 'promotion', 'sad', 'funny', 'job', 'balancing', 'wild', 'man', 'cant', 'hide', 'deep', 'loneliness', 'sadness', 'Francis', 'feels', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'co-wrote', 'screenplay', 'cousin', 'Roman', 'Coppola', 'Anderson', 'very', 'mature', 'performance', 'heartbroken', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'find', 'new', 'romance', 'train', 'rebound', 'fling', 'stewardess', 'Sweet', 'Lime', 'very', 'sweet', 'watch', 'script', 'perfect', 'capturing', 'pain', 'regret', 'brothers', 'have', 'been', 'coping', 'also', 'coming', 'up', 'bizarre', 'hilarious', 'adventures', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'lot', 'truth', 'writing', 'wonder', 'how', 'much', 'script', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'three', 'men', 'Coppola', 'lost', 'older', 'brother', 'young', 'Schwartzman', 'father', 'died', 'Anderson', 'brother', 'frequent', 'collaborator', 'films', 'Anderson', 'brilliant', 'use', 'music', 'works', 'great', 'effect', 'here', 'unearthing', 'such', 'gems', 'Kinks', 'Stones', 'as', 'well', 'using', 'lot', 'great', 'world', 'music', 'well', 'songs', 'especially', 'funeral', 'village', 'boy', 'reunion', 'mother', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'final', 'shot', 'boys', 'trying', 'catch', 'train', 'are', 'pure', 'poetry', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'symbolism', 'end', 'where', 'boys', 'let', 'go', 'baggage', 'hopping', 'train', 'home', 'bit', 'heavy', 'handed', ""'re"", 'going', 'get', 'hung', 'up', 'point', ""'ve"", 'completely', 'missed', 'point', 'film', 'only', 'complaint', 'DVD', 'wish', 'extras', 'were', 'more', 'substantive', 'film', 'begs', 'Criterion', 'release', 'complete', 'depth', 'making', 'couple', 'commentaries', 'one', 'stars', 'other', 'writers', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'Walking', 'Tour', 'supposed', 'serve', 'scenes', ""n't"", 'have', 'interviews', 'other', 'bonus', 'feature', 'least', 'good', 'one', 'short', 'film', 'Hotel', 'Chevalier', 'featuring', 'super', 'sexy', 'nearly', 'nude', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'back', 'story', 'Jack', 'why', 'ca', ""n't"", 'let', 'wild', 'woman', 'go', 'up', 'hangups', 'women', 'True', 'fans', 'film', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'Criterion', 'will', 'do', 'film', 'justice', 'day', 'disappointing', 'selection', 'extras', 'film', 'alone', 'jam', 'packed', 'are', 'moments', 'where', ""'re"", 'laughing', 'out', 'loud', 'then', 'matter', 'minutes', ""'re"", 'fighting', 'back', 'tears', 'beautiful', 'film', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'first', 'time', 'long', 'time', 'can', 'agree', 'Peter', 'Travers', 'who', 'front', 'DVD', 'love', 'movie', 'More', 'one', 'year', 'best', 'films']",N/A

Francis originally tells his two younger sibs they're going on a spiritual journey after their father's death. His real motive is to find their mother (Anjelica Huston), who's gone off to an Indian convent instead of attending their father's funeral.Unfortunately, the brothers are not only not bonding--they're driving the conductor crazy til they get kicked off.  They do manage to pull things together to help some locals and in so doing, experience the revival they'd needed.  From there, they travel to see their Mom.Even if the brothers are occasionally depressing, the scenery, music, and train are well worth watching ""Darjeeling Limited"" for.

1127526,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B0010X8NF0,RMurray847,"[2, 4]","If you haven't cared for Wes Anderson movies in the past, THE DARJEELING LIMITED will probably not help you get over that hurdle.  In my opinion, his flat-out funniest film is still THE ROYAL TENNANBAUMS...but if you don't like that, it's hard to imagine you would like DARJEELING.On the other hand, if you're a fan of the quirky, dead-pan, drier than dust humor, coupled with unorthodox camera work (a motionless camera, or a camera that moves side to side but seldom in and out) and fanciful art direction, DARJEELING should be your cup of tea (pun intended).Three estranged brothers, each carrying a load of psychic baggage, come together on a ramshackle train in India to go our a ""journey of spiritual growth.""  This journey has been arranged by the oldest brother, Owen Wilson.  He tells them that he wants them to bond and grow close again.  And in a way, this is true...but it also appears he wants them to help each other come to terms with the grief over their father's death (although he may not even realize this is a goal) and he has one other destination in mind that is a big secret (which I'll try not to spoil here.)Middle brother is Adrien Brody, who is expecting to become a father any day now, but hasn't even bothered to tell his wife that he's going on this trip.  His grief over the loss of his father is mostly obviously displayed, because he is wearing this father's glasses, even though the prescription probably isn't right for him.The youngest brother is Jason Schwartzman, who is grappling with a prolong breakup with his girlfriend (played by Natalie Portman in a little movie called HOTEL CHEVALIER which is now thankfully being played as part of this film's theatrical release.  I can't imagine enjoying DARJEELING properly without having seen it).  Schwartzman is also a writer, and he has brought with him a handwritten draft of a new short story which obviously has resonance for his brothers.These three are oddballs, to say the least.  They really don't belong in India, and really struggle to get along with each other.  They are classic Anderson characters, removed from their emotions, full of verbal and physical quirks and tics, supremely intelligent and hugely sad.At the beginning of the film, Bill Murray makes a brief cameo appearance.  Is there any actor better at being funny with so much sadness working today?  In LOST IN TRANSLATION, his character, while witty, was burdened with sadness.  In Anderson's  much maligned THE LIFE AQUATIC, Murray is nearly crippled with his sadness.  Murray has brought this to an art form not really seen since perhaps the time of Chaplin.  So his early appearance in DARJEELING almost helps to set that mood of sadness that permeates virtually every moment of the film.  But this does not make it oppressive.  The beautiful country of India, the colorful settings (the train itself is a marvel of design) and the off-the-wall incidents that occur keep the audience happily engaged.What I like about Anderson's characters is that they generally do not carry anger.  So often in films, characters who are grieving or holding in some other emotion will frequently burst out in anger or violence.  It's become an easy clich&eacute;.  However, Anderson's characters are sad.  They tamp down on that sadness, and when it does bubble up, it's seldom a physical explosion, but more of a collapse.  They are touchingly simple moments, usually.  Because the characters have spent most of the movie squashing their feelings, when they DO come up, it is all the more effective for the viewer.  There are moments in DARJEELING of simple, touching sadness...and they are very effective.So yes, this is not a happy movie.  I think in many ways, people are turned off by the films because they are expecting a quirky but harmless comedy.  However, in ROYAL TENNANBAUMS, Ben Stiller has a scene of such startling sadness and pain that it is almost too much for the viewer.  In LIFE ACQUATIC, Murray's character suffers a very painful loss near the end of the film, taking the viewer into an area that they probably didn't want to go.  And DARJEELING has a couple of moments that are totally unexpected, including a scene when the brothers are kicked off the train for bad behavior and wander into a rural village just in time to plunge into some earth-shattering events.  I know some viewers and some critics find the change in tone shocking and unwelcome.  For me, it was a powerful moment...and a poignant one.  Also, a vivid reminder that just because a movie (or life) appears to be going in one direction...don't be surprised if it takes a different turn.All three leads are terrific.  It's particularly nice to see Wilson back in form...reminding us that he is capable of something other than the complete goofball he can play in his sleep.  Angelica Huston has a small, but critical role and she is very good too.Also, I have to mention the terrific soundtrack.  The three obscure songs from The Kinks are highlights for me, and turned the album into a must have!  I never dreamed that ""Powerman"" would ever be used in a film...but it's brilliant.As I wrote this review, I realized that I was going to have to see the movie again this weekend.  I can't wait for the DVD release.  To me, it was that good.  But again, if you don't like Anderson films, you probably won't like this one either (although, I can keep my fingers crossed that you may try anyway...and end up impressed.)",5,Could be Anderson's

As he did in his previous (though better) films, ""Bottle Rocket"" and ""Rushmore,"" Anderson creates a slightly off-kilter world populated by benignly eccentric characters - only, in the case of ""Darjeeling,"" the comedy is muted and the vision bland (making it more on a par with ""The Life Aquatic"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" two of Anderson's lesser films).The price of Anderson's subtlety is that not a whole lot really seems to happen in the movie and the characters never get much of a chance to differentiate themselves from one another.  Each of the brothers is assigned a peculiarly defining quirk or eccentricity, but neither the actors nor the filmmakers (the movie was co-written by Schwartzman and Roman Coppola) seem to know quite what to do with them.

1127533,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B0010X8NF0,Samuel McKewon,"[10, 20]","""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a flop, a retread, a bore, and another sign that writer/director Wes Anderson can't press every character and story into his rigid template of cool detachment and visual irony. It's not even disappointing, really; you could see in Anderson's previous feature, ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,"" this ambition to make just about any subject funnel into his bug jar of wondrous twigs, leaves and such. Never mind if it leaves the audience stuck in first gear, perpetually sizing up leery archetypes that seem stolen from that creepy brother Dan Futterman played in the TV show ""Judging Amy.""  The characters in this India-by-train travel narrative are so flat and inert they become models in Anderson's moving diorama. What in the world are you supposed to do with them?Yeah, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" is a masterpiece. Was then, still is, gets better with age, one of the seminal works of the era, yessir, all that. (Spare us the anointing oil on ""Rushmore"" and ""Bottle Rocket."") And for that, to Wes, we say thanks. ""Tenenbaums"" is also six years old, a perfect marriage of subject and tone, and somewhere in Anderson's wheelhouse. The guy got a bit self-satisfied with ""The Life Aquatic"" - not a terrible movie (endearing, even colorful) but more or less something you'd dream up in your backyard sandbox - but ""Darjeeling"" smacks of a half-baked idea cut squarely off at the knees (Anderson can't even be troubled to keep the titular train around for the second and third acts) crossed with the director's trademark muted sentiment and one of those hairpin turns into tragedy he likes so much.Does ""The Darjeeling Limited"" have a point? Oh, sure. It's same one Anderson's been making for years: Familial reconciliation, tinged with the complexity and bittersweetness of human nature. This time it's three brothers, one of whom is recovering from a severe car accident, on a bonding trip through the land that stopped Alexander The Great cold. The train is appropriately quirky, although Anderson's camera never lingers for too long, and there is no cuter-than-thou introduction to it. Francis (Owen Wilson) has arranged the trip for Jack (Jason Schwartzman) and Peter (Adrien Brody); he runs it on a supposedly tight itinerary he has printed out by his assistant, who stays in a different part of the train.Jack's the cad, and a writer. Peter's the softy, and Francis is the control freak, an annoying trait that is no less so when we discover its roots.  The elephant in the room is their father's death; we can only guess at the trauma, because all three brothers hail from the ""Oh. Wow."" factory of emotional output. This is, in fact, the Tenenbaum family poured into these fellows - like Richie crafted picture after picture of Margot, they glumly cling to their father's possessions, such as a 12-piece set of Louis Vuitton luggage.The Anderson formula also includes some exotic, vaguely creepy foreign woman, smoking, the previously mentioned jarring transition, a dash of postmodern, story-within-a-story meta, Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray, and some music from The Kinks. Standard Wes fare.In ""Darjeeling,"" none of it works. The random sex is crass, and the depiction of India, while not phony, is not terrible complete, either, seeing that the brothers spend most of their trip in the utter wilderness, where virtually no one lives. Anderson would have us believe Schwartzman has the looks and charm to attract women while the director buries Brody's natural electricity so he can play the ""precious"" brother. The roles should have been switched. Wilson's performance is supposed to be affecting because it came around the time of his suicide attempt; I guess I'm not so easily moved. His Francis is a particular irritant, both boorish and completely full of crap, easing off the gas pedal only after he's been lured into a fistfight. The brothers only seem that way in Jack's story-within-a-story, and, even then, we're not sure if it's an accurate evocation of their feelings, or just the middle brother's wishful thinking. Either way - who cares? ""Anderson loses any non-conditioned member of the audience quickly in the first reel, tries a stab at pathos around halftime, and simply fritters about after that.Note: ""The Darjeeling Limited"" comes with a short film entitled ""Hotel Chevalier,"" a prologue featuring Jack and his ex-girlfriend, played by Natalie Portman. Esoteric and bewildering, it's kind of 13-minute scene a college student might write, enthusiastically graded by a fiction professor. It lacks any humor whatsoever and any noticeable warmth, but Portman quickly becomes naked and says a naughty word. For some reason, it still turns some weirdos on when a smart, bright kid like Portman shows how much she can't act against her essential nature by dragging her fingernails in dirt.",2,A big mess for

1127536,AE9JH12P0CETA,B0010X8NF0,S.G.R. Black,"[2, 7]","I deliberately held off for as long as I could with this one. However, a new Wes Anderson film does have its attraction. He does have that particular niche for making films that look and feel foreign. Though I wouldn't neccesarily call myself a fan. The only accomplished film I believe Anderson has made thus far is 'Rushmore'. I was 14 years old and a Freshman in high school when it opened in theaters. I loved it, and I still love it. It holds up pretty well even by today's standards. Dare I call it a classic? Perhaps.Still, that was 10 years ago and since then, Anderson has dished out 3 films, all creative and quirky. Yet, none have been able to match 'Rushmore's' fresh wit and involving characters. 'The Royal Tenenbaums' was ice cold and distant. 'The Life Aquatic' was . . . well, you can read my review on that.Suprisingly, 'The Darjeeling Limited' turns out to be his best film since 'Rushmore'. You can tell that it comes from a personal place and you can really get a feel for at least one of the main characters. Adrien Brody, in my opinion, was the better of the three. His entire persona from his physical attributes to his emotional attributes were the most developed. Either that or he's simply just a better actor than Schwartzman and Wilson-probably both. The film definitely has a sort of charm to it. The exotic setting doesn't hurt either.The problem with 'The Darjeeling Limited' is similar to the problems in 'The Royal Tenenbaums' and 'The Life Aquatic'. It's just too self-concience of itself. Anderson, along with his co-writers, somtimes make dialogue and scenes so intentionaly off-kilter that it becomes difficult for the audience to feel a real connection with the characters. If 'The Darjeeling Limited' were a person, it would be a too-proud, artisticly talented, loner who pushes people away. Lets just say the person would have some definite issues to work out much like how this film does.Now, I'm probably going to get attacked-it seems I always do when it comes to criticizing Wes Anderson. I know a lot of people revere him and his films as genius. Perhaps it's becuase the Criterion Collection seems to think so. So I will only say this: There are a lot of writers who are better directors and there are directors who are better writers. It's a rarity that you find both. I feel that Wes Anderson is a better director than he is a writer. Interestingly enough, it seems that Anderson is simply unable to write a film by himself. He hasn't yet and probably never will, and that could be our loss. We know his directing style so well but the voice of his films (after 'Rushmore') are weak and need some strengthening muscle to better them.'The Darjeeling Limited' is definitely a nice rebound from 'The Life Aquatic'. He's on the right track. I have faith in him that he'll come out with a film that will really blow all of us away. Until then, I'll wait patiently.**1/2",2,Wes Anderson-Limited,1205884800,"03 19, 2008",2008,2913,"['deliberately', 'held', 'off', 'as', 'long', 'could', 'one', 'However', 'new', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'film', 'have', 'attraction', 'have', 'particular', 'niche', 'making', 'films', 'look', 'feel', 'foreign', 'would', ""n't"", 'neccesarily', 'call', 'fan', 'only', 'accomplished', 'film', 'believe', 'Anderson', 'made', 'thus', 'far', ""'Rushmore"", 'was', '14', 'years', 'old', 'Freshman', 'high', 'school', 'when', 'opened', 'theaters', 'loved', 'still', 'love', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'Dare', 'call', 'classic', 'Perhaps.Still', 'was', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'then', 'Anderson', 'dished', 'out', '3', 'films', 'creative', 'quirky', 'none', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'match', 'fresh', 'wit', 'involving', 'characters', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'was', 'ice', 'cold', 'distant', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'was', 'well', 'can', 'read', 'review', 'that.Suprisingly', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'out', 'be', 'best', 'film', ""'Rushmore"", 'can', 'tell', 'personal', 'place', 'can', 'really', 'get', 'feel', 'least', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'opinion', 'was', 'better', 'three', 'entire', 'persona', 'physical', 'attributes', 'emotional', 'attributes', 'were', 'most', 'developed', 'simply', 'just', 'better', 'actor', 'Schwartzman', 'Wilson-probably', 'film', 'definitely', 'sort', 'charm', 'exotic', 'setting', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'either.The', 'problem', ""'The"", 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'similar', 'problems', ""'The"", 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', ""'The"", 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'just', 'too', 'self-concience', 'Anderson', 'co-writers', 'somtimes', 'make', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'so', 'intentionaly', 'off-kilter', 'difficult', 'audience', 'feel', 'real', 'connection', 'characters', ""'The"", 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'were', 'person', 'would', 'be', 'too-proud', 'artisticly', 'talented', 'loner', 'who', 'people', 'away', 'just', 'say', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'definite', 'issues', 'work', 'out', 'much', 'how', 'film', 'does.Now', ""'m"", 'probably', 'going', 'get', 'attacked-it', 'always', 'do', 'when', 'criticizing', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'know', 'lot', 'people', 'revere', 'films', 'genius', 'Perhaps', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'think', 'so', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'are', 'lot', 'writers', 'who', 'are', 'better', 'directors', 'are', 'directors', 'who', 'are', 'better', 'writers', 'rarity', 'find', 'feel', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'better', 'director', 'writer', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Anderson', 'simply', 'unable', 'write', 'film', ""n't"", 'yet', 'probably', 'never', 'will', 'could', 'be', 'loss', 'know', 'directing', 'style', 'so', 'well', 'voice', 'films', ""'Rushmore"", 'are', 'weak', 'need', 'strengthening', 'muscle', 'better', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'definitely', 'nice', 'rebound', ""'The"", 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'right', 'track', 'have', 'faith', ""'ll"", 'come', 'out', 'film', 'will', 'really', 'blow', 'away', 'then', ""'ll"", 'wait', 'patiently', '**1/2']",N/A

The direction is very stylised but completely captivating. Owen Wilson is hilarious, as are Adrian Brody and Jason Schwartzman. The relationship between the brothers is very believable and the dialogue and their familiarity add real appeal to the overall story. There are many wonderful scenes and I found Brody's dry delivery of some lines only heightened the humour in them. The storyline is charming, about reconnecting with family and resolving past issues, and it meanders along at a gentle pace, but manages to hold you attention for the whole duration. There is also a short film at the start involving Schwartzman and Natalie Portman which is both touching and a serendipitous addition.

Wow, Wes Anderson is bloody genius, man!Technique #02:I guess Wes Anderson believes in his heart of hearts that repeating different aspects of the same tale about a family of dysfunctional, self-absorbed, trust-funding Manhattan-ite Billionaires is remotely interesting at least to some people. He's bold for believing so, but foolish for not fleshing out his work a little better and trying to draw us in closer.Maybe the story started withRushmore, then went toThe Royal Tenenbaumsand thenThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissouand now (hopefully) ending full-circle with The Darjeeling Limited. I say ending, because any more of this might begin to reflect on the previous films and detract from them over time by association. Like when Star Wars geeks say stuff like: ""I like the even numbered films but not the odd numbered ones."" No, they all suck, buddy. You see how five other films dragged downThe Empire Strikes Back?Technique #03:I love Film Noir, depression as a main theme and even suicide,Harold and Maudebeing one of my favourite films, but this film just misses the mark on all counts. I really got the feeling that Jason Schwartzman and Wes Anderson were sitting on a bag of cocaine the size of Kirsten Dunst and came up with the bulk of the ideas and dialogue for this project. Even the opening segment, which was optional viewing came across as nothing more than self-indulgent film-making at its worst.Jason Schwartzman is a dynamic actor who basically just hangs around in this film giving it the only energy that's visible and seems to move it along all by himself and his own force of will.

I find it interesting that no one seems to hold Wes Anderson to any type of benchmark or standard and then just knee-jerk reacts every time he makes a film.

Some people feel like he needs to move on to something more substantial, more serious, or whatever. They feel like his films are too cute, too stylized, and the characters too brooding and self-centered. To this, Rolling Stone's Peter Travers asked why we would ever want him to do something he's not good at. Martin Scorcese does violence because he's so good at it. Other directors have their specialty.This is a good film. I found it to be moving and surprisingly serious, given the relative lightheartedness of some of his earlier stuff. The cinematography is beautiful, the setting is wonderful. As always, the music rocks. Great cast, great dialogue. There's one scene that I felt was too convenient, too forced, and too plot-handy (the brothers save some boys in a river). But that's really the only weakness I can point to.Basically, at the request of the eldest brother, the three of them go on a train trip through India to reconnect with each other and their spirituality. There are some wonderful moments and the ending is cute but moving and appropriate. Adrien Brody is a nice addition to the Anderson troupe.I'll be honest - it is a bit annoying that the brothers are filthy rich, and it makes us less sympathetic to their problems and their brooding. And Anderson's characters' brooding does get a bit old at times. But despite that, I just really found myself liking this movie.

1127551,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B0010X8NF0,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[1, 3]","I am happy to say that the new Wes Anderson film ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is much better than his last film ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"". But that is almost like damning the film with faint praise. It would be difficult for this film to be as bad as the director's last.That said, ""Darjeeling"" has some winning performances, some great humorous moments and seems to reintroduce us to the wacky sensibility that made us love the director in the first place. ""Darjeeling"" is not without it's problems, but it is a very funny and amusing film.Peter (Adrian Brody) runs to catch the Darjeeling Limited which is pulling out of a train station in a major Indian city. He soon joins his two brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman). Francis planned this trip, with the help of his beleaguered assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky, a former producer on ""The Simpsons""), because they have not spoken in over a year. He misses their conversation, their sibling rivalry and their companionship. Francis has the entire trip planned, down to the religious ceremonies they will perform at various holy sights. But when the brothers start to act up, due to a variety of circumstances, including divergent personalities, over the counter medicines and a poisonous snake, the Chief Steward (Waris Ahluwalia) kicks them off the train in the middle of the dessert. Francis soon reveals his hidden agenda and they pull together to get through the trip and become brothers again.Each of Wes Anderson's films has a style unique to the filmmaker. Each of his films is populated by a collection of off-center people who live eccentric lives in an eccentric environment. Generally, his characters have money, either as a new circumstance or their bank accounts are dwindling, but they are still used to living a certain way. ""The Darjeeling Limited"" is no exception. From the moment we meet Francis, we begin to learn he has a company of his own, and feels the need to show this off by bringing his assistant along on the trip. Brenda will drop off their schedule every morning, under the door of their compartment, before they even wake up. They brought along a computer and laminating machine to aid in this task. As Jack runs to catch the train, he is carrying a couple of pieces of odd luggage, luggage that would probably be more comfortable in the hands of a child, each piece appears to have dinosaur stickers plastered over it. As he enters the compartment he will share with his brothers, we see many other pieces of the same luggage, all of it an exact match down to the monogram. Anderson goes to a lot of trouble to design every aspect of the universe his characters will inhabit. From what I understand, he designed every aspect of the train cars we see in the film. This attention to detail shows, giving the main setting for a significant portion of the film a character; these train compartments are interesting and unique, they appear like something we would expect to find in India, but are so gaudy and over decorated, like a British Lord initially commissioned them. Now independent, the Indians seem determined to uphold the tradition of the train cars while injecting their own indigenous traditions to the interior.Each of the three leads is good and adds significantly to the overall quirky nature of the film. Owen Wilson, who has been the focus of a number of tabloid stories lately, plays Francis, the more domineering brother. At dinner, he orders food for his brothers. And he is also the force behind the trip and their itinerary. He set-up the trip because he realized the three brothers were not communicating anymore and needed some bonding time.As the more domineering, fussy member of the family, Wilson's Francis is the least funny of the three. It doesn't help that Wilson's slow drawl sort of lends a whiny quality to his character. But he is still good. When the brothers get together, they slowly start to devolve into the children they once were and Francis finds his role, mother hen.Adrian Brody's Peter is an interesting guy. He agrees to go on the trip because he is having some trouble with his girlfriend back home and wants to escape for a while. A grown man, he is unable to hide his former self when he gets together with his brothers; Francis decides Peter should have the top bunk, his long legs dangling over the side and the gangly brother is chugging some over the counter Indian pain medicine, which his siblings begin to share. But Peter seems to recognize the need for the bonding time and goes along with his brother's overbearing plans.I have never been a huge fan of Jason Schwartzman, but he is also good as Jack, clearly the youngest brother. There are some references to his life as a successful writer, living in Paris, trying to get over his ex-girlfriend. Jack carries around a short story he just competed and eagerly seeks the approval of his other brothers.From the moment they board the train, Jack is smitten with Rita (Amara Karan), an employee on the train, a sort of stewardess who makes sure the guests have enough refreshments. She recognizes the look in Jack's eyes as he continues to pursue her.Anjelica Huston pops up in a small role as Patricia, a nun living in a small monastery at the foot of the Himalayas. Patricia once played a role in the lives of the three men and their visit with her is cathartic.As much as there is to love about ""Darjeeling"", it makes a similar mistake to ""The Life Aquatic"", a mistake that derails the Bill Murray film. Thankfully, the events in ""Darjeeling"" only prove to provide an odd side trip in their journey. A confusing side trip at that; the events really seem to have no connection to the brothers or their journey. I think the key difference here is ""Life Aquatic"" ends with this event, leaving us with this as our final memory. In ""Darjeeling"", the similar event happens earlier, giving us some story to help us forget the problematic part of the story.""The Darjeeling Limited"" is a quirky, fun, funny look at three brothers on a road trip.

1127555,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B0010X8NF0,Turfseer,"[15, 36]","The Whitman brothers haven't seen each other in over a year. Francis (Owen Wilson) invites his brother Peter (Adrien Brody) and Jack (Jason Schartzman) on a cross-country train trip through the heartland of India in order to reconnect, bond and find themselves on a spiritual level. That's their internal arc. The external arc is to reunite with their mother who is now working as a nun in a convent at the ""foot of the Himalayas"".The Darjeeling Limited is actually a run-down train, the kind you would find in just about any third world landscape. The Darjeeling Limited (the Movie) attempts to mix farce with scenes of dramatic pathos unsuccessfully. For most of the movie, the three brothers are depicted as losers with a ton of emotional baggage, unable to resolve grudges they hold from an unfulfilled childhood. Unlike the Three Stooges (who mainly depended on quirky physical routines), there's little to distinguish the three witless Whitmans. Francis is the goofy businessman who spends most of the movie with his head wrapped in bandages after getting into a motorcycle accident prior to hooking up with his brothers; Peter is ostensibly running away from the responsibilities of adulthood as his wife is now 7  months pregnant back home; and Jack is a struggling writer with a propensity for casual sex (he easily beds a stewardess on the train). Note there is a 13 minute short film on the DVD entitled ""Hotel Chevalier"" which illustrates the ending of Jack's pretentious novel.Act I concerns the brothers' unfunny vignettes aboard the Darjeeling Limited. The main bit concerns their smuggling a poisonous snake aboard the train which almost gets them thrown off by the conductor. Eventually, Peter accuses Francis of being an ""Indian giver"" after he takes back an expensive belt he had given him earlier. They get into a physical altercation which spills out into the passenger section. This finally gets the hapless siblings thrown off the train in the middle of nowhere.Act II switches to a rural Indian area where the brothers witness the capsizing of a raft manned by a group of boys. The brothers jump into the river, save two of the children but are unable to save a third. The brothers are about to take a bus but are suddenly invited by the villagers to attend the boy's funeral. Obviously, this is the scene where the brothers are supposed to 'grow up' and the audience is supposed to sympathize with them. In better screenplays, moments of sympathy for the protagonists come much earlier (usually at the beginning of the story). Here, the rescue of the children occurs at the midpoint of the film and it seems out of place with Act One's slapstick tone.Act III reunites the brothers with their mother, the nun in the convent played by Anjelica Huston. There's a lame joke about an escaped tiger eating one of the nun's brothers followed by the mother making breakfast for the brothers and then disappearing. Unperturbed, the brothers go up to the mountain and bond with one another. The final scene reprises the first: the brothers just miss the departing Darjeeling Limited and must jump on board just as the train pulls out of the station.The performances here are uniformly forgettable. The usually grim Adrien Brody should be singled out for proving that he's unfit for comedy. The leering Jason Schwartzman does his Ron Jeremy imitation and Owen Wilson takes a pratfall or two. Finally, there's the director, Wes Anderson, who must be castigated not only for his self-indulgence but for having a sense of humor that is thoroughly juvenile in tone and scope. Let's hope that some of the film's bloated budget went to helping some of the indigent local population who assisted the crew while working on this film. The true star of this misguided production was the Indian countryside and its people whose earnestness is contrasted with the shallowness of the film's creators.",1,The three stooges meet 'The Guru Pitka',1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,3901,"['Whitman', 'brothers', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'other', 'year', 'Francis', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'brother', 'Peter', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Jack', 'Jason', 'Schartzman', 'cross-country', 'train', 'trip', 'heartland', 'India', 'order', 'reconnect', 'bond', 'find', 'spiritual', 'level', 'internal', 'arc', 'external', 'arc', 'reunite', 'mother', 'who', 'now', 'working', 'nun', 'convent', 'foot', 'Himalayas', '.The', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'actually', 'run-down', 'train', 'kind', 'would', 'find', 'just', 'third', 'world', 'landscape', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'Movie', 'mix', 'farce', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'pathos', 'unsuccessfully', 'most', 'movie', 'three', 'brothers', 'are', 'depicted', 'losers', 'ton', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'unable', 'resolve', 'grudges', 'hold', 'unfulfilled', 'childhood', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'who', 'mainly', 'depended', 'quirky', 'physical', 'routines', 'little', 'distinguish', 'three', 'witless', 'Whitmans', 'Francis', 'goofy', 'businessman', 'who', 'most', 'movie', 'head', 'wrapped', 'bandages', 'getting', 'motorcycle', 'accident', 'prior', 'hooking', 'up', 'brothers', 'Peter', 'ostensibly', 'running', 'away', 'responsibilities', 'adulthood', 'wife', 'now', '7', 'months', 'pregnant', 'back', 'home', 'Jack', 'struggling', 'writer', 'propensity', 'casual', 'sex', 'easily', 'stewardess', 'train', 'Note', '13', 'minute', 'short', 'film', 'DVD', 'entitled', 'Hotel', 'Chevalier', 'ending', 'Jack', 'pretentious', 'novel.Act', 'concerns', 'brothers', 'unfunny', 'vignettes', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'main', 'bit', 'concerns', 'smuggling', 'poisonous', 'snake', 'train', 'almost', 'thrown', 'off', 'conductor', 'Eventually', 'Peter', 'Francis', 'being', 'Indian', 'giver', 'back', 'expensive', 'belt', 'had', 'given', 'earlier', 'get', 'physical', 'altercation', 'out', 'passenger', 'section', 'finally', 'hapless', 'siblings', 'thrown', 'off', 'train', 'middle', 'nowhere.Act', 'II', 'switches', 'rural', 'Indian', 'area', 'where', 'brothers', 'witness', 'capsizing', 'raft', 'manned', 'group', 'boys', 'brothers', 'jump', 'river', 'save', 'two', 'children', 'are', 'unable', 'save', 'third', 'brothers', 'are', 'take', 'bus', 'are', 'suddenly', 'invited', 'villagers', 'attend', 'boy', 'funeral', 'Obviously', 'scene', 'where', 'brothers', 'are', 'supposed', ""'grow"", 'up', 'audience', 'supposed', 'sympathize', 'better', 'screenplays', 'moments', 'sympathy', 'protagonists', 'come', 'much', 'earlier', 'usually', 'beginning', 'story', 'Here', 'rescue', 'children', 'midpoint', 'film', 'place', 'Act', 'One', 'slapstick', 'tone.Act', 'III', 'brothers', 'mother', 'nun', 'convent', 'played', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'lame', 'joke', 'escaped', 'tiger', 'eating', 'one', 'nun', 'brothers', 'followed', 'mother', 'making', 'breakfast', 'brothers', 'then', 'disappearing', 'Unperturbed', 'brothers', 'go', 'up', 'mountain', 'bond', 'one', 'final', 'scene', 'first', 'brothers', 'just', 'miss', 'departing', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'must', 'jump', 'board', 'just', 'train', 'station.The', 'performances', 'here', 'are', 'uniformly', 'forgettable', 'usually', 'grim', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'should', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'proving', 'unfit', 'comedy', 'leering', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Ron', 'Jeremy', 'imitation', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'pratfall', 'two', 'Finally', 'director', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'who', 'must', 'be', 'castigated', 'not', 'only', 'self-indulgence', 'having', 'sense', 'humor', 'thoroughly', 'juvenile', 'tone', 'scope', 'Let', 'hope', 'film', 'bloated', 'budget', 'went', 'helping', 'indigent', 'local', 'population', 'who', 'assisted', 'crew', 'working', 'film', 'true', 'star', 'misguided', 'production', 'was', 'Indian', 'countryside', 'people', 'earnestness', 'contrasted', 'shallowness', 'film', 'creators']",N/A

The Darjeeling Limited is reminiscent of other Wes Anderson films, especially The Royal Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, with its flawed, idiosyncratic characters searching in odd, dysfunctional ways for a connection within a dysfunctional family.

1127558,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B0010X8NF0,Wheelchair Assassin,"[1, 1]","In the five years or so following the heaps of acclaim bestowed upon Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, and the commercial success of The Royal Tenenbaums, those who consider Wes Anderson a genius and an innovator seem to have lost some ground to those who consider him the worst thing to happen to cinema since someone decided it would be a good idea to start making movies out of video games.  Still, there's no denying that Anderson remains a premier visual stylist, and over the course of his last two movies the ambition of his storytelling has started to catch up with his artistic vision and his well-documented influences.  His most recent work, the Darjeeling Limited, continues in the globetrotting vein of its classic predecessor The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, while indulging pretty much all of the fetishes (alienated characters, meticulous wardrobe and set design, British Invasion and world music, Owen Wilson) that make Anderson's movies so quickly recognizable.  Like all of his movies, it at least looks good, which makes it a step up from the sitcom-style direction that marks a lot of Hollywood comedies these days, and as usual Anderson avoids the overreliance on contrived quirks that indie movies so often give in to.If you belong to the faction who say (not without reason) that Anderson's movies dwell excessively on familial dysfunction and father issues, The Darjeeling Limited definitely won't do much to answer your criticisms.  Following three estranged American brothers (Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and Jason Schwartzman) who reunite a year after their father's death for a train trip across India, the movie explores the lingering divide between its relationship-impaired characters with Anderson's usual sympathy even as he pokes fun at their failings.  In a device only Anderson could get away with, Wilson's alpha-brother Francis lays out the parameters early on--a spiritual journey open to anything, no matter how shocking or painful--complete with an itinerary provided by Francis's alapecea-stricken assistant.  Of course, this being an Anderson movie, the trip quickly descends into a morass of resentment, backbiting, and fractured relationships, all conveyed with his usual deadpan humor and a bit of slapstick thrown in for good measure.While I have to admit I was a little bummed about the near-total absence of Bill Murray this time around, if nothing else The Darjeeling Limited does mark another chapter in the fruitful collaboration of Anderson and Owen Wilson.  While their long-time connection hasn't quite reached the level of Scorsese-DeNiro or Kurosawa-Mifune,  the quality of their directing/acting/sometimes writing partnership does at least put them in the company of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg.  Of late Wilson seems to have been in a contest with Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn to see who can appear in the most mediocre Hollywood comedies, but he's always done good work with Anderson whether he co-wrote or not, and his performance here is a nice variation on the wide-eyed optimist persona that he first developed in Bottle Rocket.  As Francis's brothers and travel partners, Brody manages to at least add a layer of reflectiveness to his usual bland competence, while Schwartzman (sporting a classic adult-film mustache) skillfully projects the same mix of innocence and smarm that he brought to his Rushmore breakthrough.While Anderson's movies have never precisely taken place in the real world, The Darjeeling Limited does see him bringing his whimsical style to an exploration of cultural convergence as its wealthy, entitled protagonists find themselves adrift in a more traditional (and, the movie shows, in some ways backward) society.  Fittingly, it's not until the brothers are forced to deviate from their pre-planned itinerary that the trip really gets going, with their reconciliation mirroring their engagement with India and its more out-of-the-way locales.  Much like on The Life Aquatic, Anderson clearly made a playground of his exotic locations, and it all shows up in the film.  From some great, Scorsese-esque tracking shots inside the train to claustrophobic cityscapes to expansive cinematography of the Indian countryside, the setting figures as extensively in this movie as Anderson's old high school in Rushmore or the high seas in The Life Aquatic, adding another layer of the personality that's always set Anderson movies apart.Overall, aside from Anderson's usual visual flair, The Darjeeling Limited contains more than enough characterization and humor to be another sytlish and entertaining entry in the Wes Anderson filmography.  Not quite as essential as some of his other films, but if you like his prior work you should find a lot to enjoy in this one.",4,"Well, I liked it...",1231545600,"01 10, 2009",2009,4745,"['five', 'years', 'so', 'following', 'heaps', 'acclaim', 'bestowed', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Rushmore', 'commercial', 'success', 'Royal', 'Tenenbaums', 'who', 'consider', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'genius', 'innovator', 'seem', 'have', 'lost', 'ground', 'who', 'consider', 'worst', 'thing', 'happen', 'cinema', 'someone', 'decided', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'idea', 'start', 'making', 'movies', 'video', 'games', 'Still', 'denying', 'Anderson', 'premier', 'visual', 'stylist', 'course', 'last', 'two', 'movies', 'ambition', 'storytelling', 'started', 'catch', 'up', 'artistic', 'vision', 'well-documented', 'influences', 'most', 'recent', 'work', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'globetrotting', 'vein', 'classic', 'predecessor', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Steve', 'Zissou', 'indulging', 'pretty', 'much', 'fetishes', 'alienated', 'characters', 'meticulous', 'wardrobe', 'set', 'design', 'British', 'Invasion', 'world', 'music', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'make', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'so', 'quickly', 'recognizable', 'movies', 'least', 'looks', 'good', 'step', 'up', 'sitcom-style', 'direction', 'lot', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'days', 'usual', 'Anderson', 'overreliance', 'contrived', 'quirks', 'indie', 'movies', 'so', 'often', 'give', 'to.If', 'belong', 'faction', 'who', 'say', 'not', 'reason', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'dwell', 'excessively', 'familial', 'dysfunction', 'father', 'issues', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'definitely', 'wo', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'answer', 'criticisms', 'Following', 'three', 'estranged', 'American', 'brothers', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'who', 'reunite', 'year', 'father', 'death', 'train', 'trip', 'India', 'movie', 'lingering', 'divide', 'relationship-impaired', 'characters', 'Anderson', 'usual', 'sympathy', 'even', 'fun', 'failings', 'device', 'only', 'Anderson', 'could', 'get', 'away', 'Wilson', 'alpha-brother', 'Francis', 'out', 'parameters', 'early', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'open', 'anything', 'matter', 'how', 'shocking', 'painful', 'complete', 'itinerary', 'provided', 'Francis', 'alapecea-stricken', 'assistant', 'course', 'being', 'Anderson', 'movie', 'trip', 'quickly', 'morass', 'resentment', 'backbiting', 'fractured', 'relationships', 'conveyed', 'usual', 'deadpan', 'humor', 'bit', 'slapstick', 'thrown', 'good', 'measure.While', 'have', 'admit', 'was', 'little', 'bummed', 'near-total', 'absence', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'time', 'around', 'nothing', 'else', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'mark', 'chapter', 'fruitful', 'collaboration', 'Anderson', 'Owen', 'Wilson', 'long-time', 'connection', ""n't"", 'quite', 'reached', 'level', 'Scorsese-DeNiro', 'Kurosawa-Mifune', 'quality', 'directing/acting/sometimes', 'writing', 'partnership', 'least', 'put', 'company', 'Edgar', 'Wright', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'late', 'Wilson', 'have', 'been', 'contest', 'Ben', 'Stiller', 'Vince', 'Vaughn', 'see', 'who', 'can', 'appear', 'most', 'mediocre', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', 'always', 'done', 'good', 'work', 'Anderson', 'co-wrote', 'not', 'performance', 'here', 'nice', 'variation', 'wide-eyed', 'optimist', 'persona', 'first', 'developed', 'Bottle', 'Rocket', 'Francis', 'brothers', 'travel', 'partners', 'Brody', 'least', 'add', 'layer', 'reflectiveness', 'usual', 'bland', 'competence', 'Schwartzman', 'sporting', 'classic', 'adult-film', 'mustache', 'skillfully', 'projects', 'same', 'mix', 'innocence', 'smarm', 'brought', 'Rushmore', 'breakthrough.While', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'have', 'never', 'precisely', 'taken', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'see', 'bringing', 'whimsical', 'style', 'exploration', 'cultural', 'convergence', 'wealthy', 'entitled', 'protagonists', 'find', 'adrift', 'more', 'traditional', 'movie', 'ways', 'backward', 'society', 'Fittingly', 'not', 'brothers', 'are', 'forced', 'deviate', 'pre-planned', 'itinerary', 'trip', 'really', 'going', 'reconciliation', 'mirroring', 'engagement', 'India', 'more', 'out-of-the-way', 'locales', 'Much', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'Anderson', 'clearly', 'made', 'playground', 'exotic', 'locations', 'up', 'film', 'great', 'Scorsese-esque', 'tracking', 'shots', 'train', 'claustrophobic', 'cityscapes', 'expansive', 'cinematography', 'Indian', 'countryside', 'setting', 'figures', 'extensively', 'movie', 'Anderson', 'old', 'high', 'school', 'Rushmore', 'high', 'seas', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'adding', 'layer', 'personality', 'always', 'set', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'apart.Overall', 'aside', 'Anderson', 'usual', 'visual', 'flair', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'more', 'enough', 'characterization', 'humor', 'be', 'sytlish', 'entertaining', 'entry', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'filmography', 'Not', 'quite', 'as', 'essential', 'other', 'films', 'prior', 'work', 'should', 'find', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'one']",N/A

Anderson is a master of the quirky, laugh to yourself comedy centered on dysfunctional characters.  While the Darjeeling Limited doesn't measure up to my two favorite Anderson movies, Royal Tennenbaum's and Rushmore, it is not that far behind.Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman and Adrien Brody play three brothers who have grown apart over the years.  Wilson schemes this ""reunion"" as a supposed spiritual journey through India aboard the train ""Darjeeling Limited"".  Little do Brody and Schwartzman realize that Wilson has brought them together to see their mother who is now at a remote monastery in remote India.Anderson doesn't go for the cheap laughs and isn't about the funny one-liners.  There are plenty of offbeat and hilarious scenes -- the brothers first meal aboard the train is priceless.  There is definitely great chemistry with the three actors as well as some great performances by the secondary Indian characters.  The seminal event occurs when the brothers encounter death in a raging river while trying to rescue three locals.  The death of one of the children causes them to reminisce about their own father's death and begins the process of bringing them closer together.Anderson does a great job with the camera work -- especially capturing the tight quarters of the ""Darjeeling"" -- and captures the rich hues of India.  At times, you could almost smell and taste the flavors of India.Once again, this is certainly not a film for everyone.  If you are looking for a standard Hollywood comedy, don't watch this movie.  Anderson doesn't make traditional comedies and this is likely to leave you annoyed and disappointed.  However, if you are a fan of Anderson's, this is well worth the viewing.",4,If you like Wes Anderson....,1213401600,"06 14, 2008",2008,1836,"['then', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'wo', ""n't"", 'disappoint', 'However', 'are', 'not', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fan', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'skip', 'film', 'Anderson', 'master', 'quirky', 'laugh', 'yourself', 'comedy', 'centered', 'dysfunctional', 'characters', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', ""n't"", 'measure', 'up', 'two', 'favorite', 'Anderson', 'movies', 'Royal', 'Tennenbaum', 'Rushmore', 'not', 'far', 'behind.Owen', 'Wilson', 'Jason', 'Schwartzman', 'Adrien', 'Brody', 'play', 'three', 'brothers', 'who', 'have', 'grown', 'apart', 'years', 'Wilson', 'reunion', 'supposed', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'India', 'train', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'Little', 'do', 'Brody', 'Schwartzman', 'realize', 'Wilson', 'brought', 'together', 'see', 'mother', 'who', 'now', 'remote', 'monastery', 'remote', 'India.Anderson', ""n't"", 'go', 'cheap', 'laughs', ""n't"", 'funny', 'one-liners', 'are', 'plenty', 'offbeat', 'hilarious', 'scenes', 'brothers', 'first', 'meal', 'train', 'priceless', 'definitely', 'great', 'chemistry', 'three', 'actors', 'as', 'well', 'great', 'performances', 'secondary', 'Indian', 'characters', 'seminal', 'event', 'when', 'brothers', 'encounter', 'death', 'raging', 'river', 'trying', 'rescue', 'three', 'locals', 'death', 'one', 'children', 'reminisce', 'own', 'father', 'death', 'process', 'bringing', 'closer', 'together.Anderson', 'great', 'job', 'camera', 'work', 'especially', 'capturing', 'tight', 'quarters', 'Darjeeling', 'rich', 'hues', 'India', 'times', 'could', 'almost', 'smell', 'taste', 'flavors', 'India.Once', 'again', 'certainly', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'are', 'looking', 'standard', 'Hollywood', 'comedy', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'Anderson', ""n't"", 'make', 'traditional', 'comedies', 'likely', 'leave', 'annoyed', 'disappointed', 'However', 'are', 'fan', 'Anderson', 'well', 'viewing']",N/A

I can understand that if you are not a Wes Anderson fan, you might not really get the movie and find it slow, but if you are a Wes Anderson fan, then this film may reach you.Really, the backbone theme that I get form this movie that Wes had not really explored as much before was the idea of mourning and loss.  The characters in the movie are going on a rather vain and ridiculous ""spiritual journey"" to help mourn the loss of their father, their absent mother, and whatever else in life is bothering them.  It is full of superficial feelings and the boys then learn about because of an incident when they experience true loss and see absolute mourning of an entire village.  This events gives them the strength tor really go and confront their absent mother in an attempt to heal themselves.Like I said, the movie is paced a little slow, but I still love the story line and the acting as well as the directing.  That was my one real complaint with his last movie, ""The Life Aquatic"" was the pacing and editing of the film.  It really made itself choppy and forced.  As much as I loved the story and the acting, it is hard for me to watch.  This one is not as choppy and is put together much more smoothly overall.I recommend this to all Wes Anderson fans as well as indie film buffs, but outside of that, I can see where others will be turned off by it.",4,Wes is always good.,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,1571,"['So', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'be', 'bit', 'downslide', 'late', 'not', 'mean', 'do', 'not', 'enjoy', 'film', 'others.So', 'Darjeeling', 'Limited', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'still', 'good', 'movie', 'can', 'understand', 'are', 'not', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fan', 'might', 'not', 'really', 'get', 'movie', 'find', 'slow', 'are', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fan', 'then', 'film', 'may', 'reach', 'you.Really', 'backbone', 'theme', 'get', 'form', 'movie', 'Wes', 'had', 'not', 'really', 'explored', 'much', 'was', 'idea', 'mourning', 'loss', 'characters', 'movie', 'are', 'going', 'rather', 'vain', 'ridiculous', 'spiritual', 'journey', 'help', 'mourn', 'loss', 'father', 'absent', 'mother', 'else', 'life', 'bothering', 'full', 'superficial', 'feelings', 'boys', 'then', 'learn', 'incident', 'when', 'experience', 'true', 'loss', 'see', 'absolute', 'mourning', 'entire', 'village', 'events', 'strength', 'tor', 'really', 'go', 'confront', 'absent', 'mother', 'attempt', 'heal', 'themselves.Like', 'said', 'movie', 'paced', 'little', 'slow', 'still', 'love', 'story', 'line', 'acting', 'as', 'well', 'directing', 'was', 'one', 'real', 'complaint', 'last', 'movie', 'Life', 'Aquatic', 'was', 'pacing', 'editing', 'film', 'really', 'made', 'choppy', 'forced', 'As', 'much', 'loved', 'story', 'acting', 'hard', 'watch', 'one', 'not', 'choppy', 'put', 'together', 'much', 'more', 'smoothly', 'overall.I', 'recommend', 'Wes', 'Anderson', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'indie', 'film', 'buffs', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'others', 'will', 'be', 'turned', 'off']",N/A
