She enjoyed being the wife of the viceroy, a mother, and a leader of charities. However when her husband died she finally, against her children's wishes, had time to contemplate her life, what it could have been and what it will be.She moves into a smaller house that she had seen 30 years before. Now she strikes up a friend ship with people as the house owner, the craftsman repairing the house and others.Unknown to her is a friend of one of her sons, who knew her 60 years ago in India.  He reliving the time and she realizing that they both had great depth that was not required of them at the time, form a unique friendship.We get the privilege of watching Lady Slane make her discoveries and the reaction to this by the family.  Of particular interest is her great grand daughter is now on the cusp of making the same life choice that Lady Slane succumbed to.Based on the novel by Vita Sackville-West, ""All Passion Spent"" we see a lot of Vita's real life parallels.

185293,A1R29FLZWPCURK,1569388725,George Goldberg,"[10, 11]","A very nice movie but not quite the ultimate feminist manifesto. After all, Lady Slane is, first of all, ""Lady"" because of the position held by her deceased husband. Second, while the film insists that she is not nearly as wealthy as she should be and would be if Britain paid its public officials more generously, she has a sufficiency to rent a house in Hampstead with an acre of land, to fix the house up beautifully (it is in desperate disrepair), to afford a full-time personal maid, &c.; While the life thus available to her may not be what her (mostly awful) children think she should have, most of us would not feel terribly disadvantaged to have it. In other words, one must be rather well disposed to the British aristocracy not to think occasionally, during this movie, about the Declaration of Independence.That being said, the film is beautifully done. I have adored Wendy Hiller since her early days (1930s) playing George Bernard Shaw heroines, most memorably Major Barbara. You had better agree, for the cameraman is totally in love with her, and if she were any less charming, the entire show would fall apart. But her charm is limitless and so the focus on her every expression is welcome. All the other parts, both the fine fellows and the spoiled brats, are well done; the great granddaughter is as charming as her ancestor. The scenes are lovely. Many years ago I lived in London and recognize the architecture and even more the gardens - we had a lovely garden, albeit one we shared with our neighbors (neighbours). The film, a mini series, is spread over 3 episodes each lasting a bit under an hour, ideal for watching at dinner time over 3 days, which is what we did with great pleasure. It certainly was a welcome change from the clangor of the political/economic news. I do recommend it highly.",5,A charming respite from the clangor of everyday life.,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,1820,"['very', 'nice', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'ultimate', 'feminist', 'manifesto', 'Lady', 'Slane', 'first', 'all', 'Lady', 'position', 'held', 'deceased', 'husband', 'Second', 'film', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'wealthy', 'should', 'be', 'would', 'be', 'Britain', 'paid', 'public', 'officials', 'more', 'generously', 'sufficiency', 'rent', 'house', 'Hampstead', 'acre', 'land', 'fix', 'house', 'up', 'beautifully', 'desperate', 'disrepair', 'afford', 'full-time', 'personal', 'maid', 'c.', 'life', 'thus', 'available', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'what', 'mostly', 'awful', 'children', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'most', 'would', 'not', 'feel', 'terribly', 'disadvantaged', 'have', 'other', 'words', 'one', 'must', 'be', 'rather', 'well', 'disposed', 'British', 'aristocracy', 'not', 'think', 'occasionally', 'movie', 'Declaration', 'Independence.That', 'being', 'said', 'film', 'beautifully', 'done', 'have', 'adored', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'early', 'days', '1930s', 'playing', 'George', 'Bernard', 'Shaw', 'heroines', 'most', 'memorably', 'Major', 'Barbara', 'had', 'better', 'agree', 'cameraman', 'totally', 'love', 'were', 'less', 'charming', 'entire', 'show', 'would', 'fall', 'apart', 'charm', 'limitless', 'so', 'focus', 'expression', 'welcome', 'other', 'parts', 'fine', 'fellows', 'spoiled', 'brats', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'great', 'granddaughter', 'as', 'charming', 'ancestor', 'scenes', 'are', 'lovely', 'Many', 'years', 'ago', 'lived', 'London', 'recognize', 'architecture', 'even', 'more', 'gardens', 'had', 'lovely', 'garden', 'one', 'shared', 'neighbors', 'neighbours', 'film', 'mini', 'series', 'spread', '3', 'episodes', 'lasting', 'bit', 'hour', 'ideal', 'watching', 'dinner', 'time', '3', 'days', 'what', 'did', 'great', 'pleasure', 'certainly', 'was', 'welcome', 'change', 'clangor', 'political/economic', 'news', 'do', 'recommend', 'highly']",N/A

She is a ""Victorian-style"" widow who surprises her family with gumption and a mind of her own. At age 85, Lady Slane (Dame Wendy Hiller-`Anne of Avonlea') becomes like a woman of the 21st century and makes her own decisions, a step ahead of her greedy heirs, and to the delight of the viewer. She downsizes, gives away much of what others think important, and moves to Hampstead Heath, a place to rest, a place with peach trees, and refuses visitors under age 40. One exception is a great-granddaughter, Deborah (Jane Snowden-amazing also in `Wish Me Luck') who L. Slane sees as similar to herself as a young girl.The cast makes this Masterpiece Theatre, BBC, Vita (Victoria Mary) Sackville-West adaptation a success.Mr. Fitzgeorge (Harry Andrews-`S.O.S. Titanic' 'Agony & the Ecstasy') was a past relationship with the Lady, and reminds her of much, but only after her husband's death. Son Herbert (Graham Crowden-`The Way We Live Now' `Bleak House' `Waiting for God') and his wife Mabel (Antonia Pemberton-`Enemy at the Door' `Behaving Badly') lead the greed of offspring. Son, Kay (John Franklyn-Robbins-`Emma' `I, Claudius') and daughter/spinster Edith (Hilary Mason-`Nicholas Nickleby' `Maid Marion and Her Merry Men') seem the best of the children. Daughter Carrie played by Phyllis Calvert (`Mrs Dalloway' `Kate' `Little Women'). Son William (Geoffrey Bayldon-`Hallelujah!' `To Sir With Love') and wife Lavinia (Faith Brook-`The Irish R.M.' `War and Peace') also scheme to get all and everything they can of value.

We see more from the aged children than the recent widow.  And what we see of the children isn't pretty.  Most of them are more worried about the money than their Mum, who they deem impractical and very amenable to do what they want with her.Turns out, she isn't.  Lady Slane decides to take a cottage in the Hampsteads, a home she'd seen thirty years prior that turns out to still be available for rent.Instead of the society the family expects her to keep, she has tea mostly with the landlord and handyman.  The only family member who visits often is great-granddaughter Deborah (Snowden) who is about to wed a Duke and isn't particularly happy about the situation.It's fascinating to watch how these two generations of the family evolve and change as they have decisions to make about their lives and futures.  The story's lovely and strongly emotional.

How much freedom do duty and love permit any person? The writing is wonderful, the staging unfussy and utterly convincing, and the cast - led by the superb Wendy Hiller - completely winning.
