This movie does have some hilarious characters in there like Mr. Gorsh (or whatever the landlord's name is... he's he guy who rides the scooter). The advice he tries to give Simon's character to try and lift his morale comes out in a really messed up way... especially when he was talking about his own dead wife!! What a muppet!Even though I hate romantic comedies, this one wasn't like a double shot of romantic comedies that are mind numbingly predictable and you know that they are made for those people who just want to see what they want to see happen (just go on a chocolate binge and spare us these so called movies)! I will admit that being a romantic comedy, you can still pretty much predict what happens at the end almost three quarters into the movie! However, like I said the comedy up to that point is hilarious and is worth the watch...I will admit, however, that it is not one of the most watched movies in my library because IT'S A ROMANTIC COMEDY!

1112380,A3TXO9NUIJ4G0X,B000WXDMLE,Angela,"[3, 4]","The unfortunately titled Run Fatboy Run comes from that risky, murky water where comedians decide they want to be sweeties. Sometimes, this can be golden: Simon Pegg, who stars as the slobbering, unreconstructed-on-the-way-to-construction hero, Dennis, is particularly talented at juggling the flatulent with the heartwarming. However, it's a dangerous idea, as comedians can sometimes get derailed on their way to sensitive, saccharine warmth, and end up in the horribly, gouge-your-eyes-out maudlin. For example, Robin Williams in a number of films (thoughWhat Dreams May Comemay be the most notorious), or Adam Sandler's nauseating self-pity in the gratingly unfunnyFunny People.Adam Sandler's actually a good match for Simon Pegg, as they both specialize in frat boy (or, well, the British equivalent) humo(u)r that is underscored by a genuine authenticity - they are both adept at playing man-children. Run Fatboy Run introduces us to Dennis (Simon Pegg) on the day of his wedding: his gorgeous, pregnant bride-to-be, Libby (Thandie Newton), chats with her amiable cousin, Gordon (Dylan Moran), and Dennis? He's the one sprinting down the street, away from the garden party. Fast forward five years and fifteen kilos, and Dennis, now a dumpy security guard, is sprinting after a (incidentally hilarious!) transvestite shoplifter. He lives in a basement flat, where he is periodically heckled by his (incidentally hilarious) landlord, Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel, fromMy Son the Fanatic), for perpetually forgetting his keys.When Dennis visits Libby to pick up their son, Jake (Matthew Fenton), he is introduced to Libby's new boyfriend: Whit (Hank Azaria). Whit is everything Dennis is not: a successful hedge fund manager, he showers Libby and Jake with expensive gadgets and affection, is breezily self-confident in a very American way, and runs charity marathons for fun. Dennis, privately, seethes. He decides to remedy his broken heart and dead-end life by challenging Whit to his own marathon. Everyone does a lot of scoffing and snorting with laughter - what, Dennis? the fat guy? a marathon? - and Dennis, meanwhile, with his gambling buddy, Gordon, and Mr. Goshdashtidar, gets down to training. The rest of the film follows the usual course.Run Fatboy Run generally avoids some of the disasterous pitfalls which threaten a movie like this, mostly because, as we said above, Simon Pegg has a good handle on balancing sympathy with humor, and we have a very high tolerance for seeing him be sad before we consider it over-the-top and indulgent. We think this is generally because Pegg sparingly uses that most deadliest of comic weapons - irony - and hence never distances himself from the character. Yes, Dennis is a clumsy, Homer Simpson-esque buffoon, but he's also, always, human. Everything is played straight. Example: when Dennis, in usual Disney-style manipulation, momentarily loses his son, there is real horror and panic. It's a credit to Pegg, who specializes in airy comedy that's been deep fried in pop culture, that he is actually a very authentic actor indeed.Other cast members, such as Dylan Moran and Harish Patel, have a good ol' time and offer charming support to the central conceit. For the most part, the film succeeds because it feels more like a Nick Hornby movie (we were specifically reminded ofAbout a Boy (Widescreen Edition)), though things spiral slightly out of control with the climax, which becomes so sticky with sugar that we had to go wash our eyeballs. All in all, it's not a memorable film and Pegg's characteristic surrealism is missing, but it's a modest and inoffensive heart-shaped fluff piece.

Let me, in response to another reviewers question ""who would pay money to see a fat boy run?"" ask: who wouldn't?The story is neither original nor complicated. At their wedding, Simon Pegg's character gets cold feet and takes off without explanation, leaving his pregnant girlfriend behind. 5 years down the line he, now a fat, pathtic looser without the mone to pay the rent, realises that he actually left the love of his life behind that day. She has found a rich, handsome, athletic American played very well by Hank Azaria, and has no need for her former fiance. So to win her back, Pegg must compete against his American competitor in a marathon race. Chaos and hilarity ensues.Simon Pegg, who is nothing short of a comic genius, plays the gormless loser so joyously well, and adds to it his incredible sense of physical comedy. His American rival is in turn played expertly by Mr. Azaria, who somehow manages to portray a character that at the same time is absolutely charming, wonderful, and thoroughly unlikeable. The always funny Dylan Moran adds his own interesting personae to the character Gordon, the best friend of Peggs character. Also a guest visit from Little Britains David Walliams, makes for a nice little surprise.I'm not the biggest fan of director David Schwimmer, but I must admit that he's done a decent job with this one. The score, scenery, production, and all the rest of it is also done quite well.So in conclusion I'll say, that while ""Run Fat Boy Run"" is not in any way original or spellbinding, it does provide some solid laughs and is never boring.

1112388,A1VM6A7HC6CEIH,B000WXDMLE,"David Segrove ""DinA""","[0, 1]","David Schwimmer (yes, ""Ross"" from friends"") makes his directorial debut with this film and doesn't do a bad job (note to Mr. Schwimmer - stay on that side of the camera). Simple story : Boy leaves pregnant girlfriend at the altar. Several years later, boy realizes what he was missing, but girlfriend has new boyfriend who is about to run a marathon. Boy decides the only way to get her back is to run against the new boyfriend...etc etc.It's more detailed than that, but you get the gist. Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) plays the deadbeat Dennis Doyle to perfection. He's just go that ""every man"" look about him which suits the part. Hank Azaria (Godzilla, Mystery Men) plays his nemesis very well too.For someone who has not been back to London in many years, this film felt a little like a trip down memory lane. The films is set all over the city and is diverse in locations and cast members. Doyle is a loser. He's a security guard in a women's underwear store who can't even catch a shoplifter. His decision to run in a Nike challenge (product placement galore) is motivated purely by a desire to get his girlfriend back from her all-American stud boyfriend. The Anglo-American rivalry is set, though it's not transparently obvious in the conflict (ie no one resorts to calling anyone ""brit"" or ""yank""), but it's a clash of lifestyle, culture and egos. The film pokes gentle fun at everyone, from the stereotypical characters to the over-the-top media coverage of the marathon's dramatic climax.The ending is perfect, and I was surprised that the tension towards the end really worked well. I think Schwimmer has a promising directorial career ahead. The film doesn't have the ""silly"" humor or the laugh-upon-laugh of ""Shaun of the Dead"". It's a little more subtle, but just as, if not more satisfying.Well worth watching.",4,EXCELLENT DEBUT FOR DIRECTOR SCHWIMMER,1248566400,"07 26, 2009",2009,1828,"['David', 'Schwimmer', 'yes', 'Ross', 'friends', 'directorial', 'debut', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'note', 'Mr.', 'Schwimmer', 'stay', 'side', 'camera', 'Simple', 'story', 'Boy', 'pregnant', 'girlfriend', 'altar', 'Several', 'years', 'later', 'boy', 'what', 'was', 'missing', 'girlfriend', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'run', 'marathon', 'Boy', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'back', 'run', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'etc.It', 'more', 'detailed', 'get', 'gist', 'Simon', 'Pegg', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'deadbeat', 'Dennis', 'Doyle', 'perfection', 'just', 'go', 'man', 'look', 'suits', 'part', 'Hank', 'Azaria', 'Godzilla', 'Mystery', 'Men', 'nemesis', 'very', 'well', 'someone', 'who', 'not', 'been', 'back', 'London', 'many', 'years', 'film', 'felt', 'little', 'trip', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'films', 'set', 'city', 'diverse', 'locations', 'cast', 'members', 'Doyle', 'loser', 'security', 'guard', 'women', 'underwear', 'store', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'catch', 'shoplifter', 'decision', 'run', 'Nike', 'challenge', 'product', 'placement', 'galore', 'motivated', 'purely', 'desire', 'get', 'girlfriend', 'back', 'all-American', 'stud', 'boyfriend', 'Anglo-American', 'rivalry', 'set', 'not', 'transparently', 'obvious', 'conflict', 'ie', 'one', 'calling', 'anyone', 'brit', 'yank', 'clash', 'lifestyle', 'culture', 'egos', 'film', 'gentle', 'fun', 'everyone', 'stereotypical', 'characters', 'over-the-top', 'media', 'coverage', 'marathon', 'dramatic', 'climax.The', 'ending', 'perfect', 'was', 'surprised', 'tension', 'end', 'really', 'worked', 'well', 'think', 'Schwimmer', 'promising', 'directorial', 'career', 'ahead', 'film', ""n't"", 'have', 'silly', 'humor', 'laugh-upon-laugh', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'little', 'more', 'subtle', 'just', 'not', 'more', 'satisfying.Well', 'worth', 'watching']","Run, Fat Boy, Run"

And, this is where the trouble begins. The enormous creative-talent invested in this film should have yielded an amusing, innovative work. Instead, Run, Fatboy, Run is just another rom-com in a long list of predictable rom-coms.Perhaps most problematic, the screenplay heavily relies on film cliches. From the first four minutes, the viewer can plot the entire film: disappointing from a writer as clever as Michael Ian Black (seeStella, The State, andMy Custom Van: And 50 Other Mind-Blowing Essays that Will Blow Your Mind All Over Your Face). The same can be noted of Simon Pegg (who contributed to the playful, wittyShaun of the DeadandHot Fuzz). The collaboration of Black and Pegg should have been synergistic ... but Run, Fatboy, Run is decidedly trite. (And, as a warning, it's steeped in both low-brow and physical humor).Though nothing can redeem this half-hearted film, David Schwimmer's direction was excellent. The former ""Friends"" star has proven that his talents extend beyond on-screen work. Likewise, Dylan Moran commits to his role as the ""fair-weather friend"" ... and while his part is entirely one-dimensional, the viewer can note his effort. (He is a phenomenal actor ... be sure to check out his other work!)This is your typical rom-com with all the rom-com trappings. For Pegg fans, this film will prove a tremendous disappointment -- there is nothing nuanced about this work. For Black fans, this work will seem all too obvious -- there is not even a hint of his trademark ""kookiness"" here. If you are hoping for a reprisal of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, or even The State, just walk-away NOW!! You will only be frustrated.

This is a tale of a 30-something Englishman who five years earlier got cold feet at his wedding and ""ran"" off from his pregnant fianc&eacute;e. Now he wants desperately to get back into her and their 5 year old son's life, but a new successful American businessman (Simpsons' Hank Azaria, who does better than expected) is in the way. Soon, Pegg's Dennis sees that an English marathon that Azaria's running in as well is his only chance to prove that he can finally finish something, even though he's slightly out-of-shape and is going to need help to prepare...I found this movie to be very warm and humorous, great for 30ish Dad's like myself. Pegg does a great job in his typical way, but the title stinks. He's NOT fat, he's got a spare tire, and even it looks a little unnoticable, while others still call him ""fatboy"". Like other Pegg films, instead of partner Nick ""Hot Fuzz"" Frost at his side, we now get another Shawn alumni Dylan Moran, who does a great turn as Thandie Newton's cousin and Dennis' best friend. It's been touted as a modern-day English Rocky, and while there's some things that earn it, it's also very funny in some parts too. Comes with trailers, making-of, bloopers and a commentary track with Pegg, Moran, Schwimmer (who still sounds like Ross after breaking up with Rachel), and strangely Pegg's real-life mother (why?), this release is worth a purchase and/or viewing. In fact, I enjoyed it more than Pegg's Hot Fuzz, which was a pretty good film in itself too. A nice surprise of a movie by two men you didn't think had it in them.

1112398,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000WXDMLE,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","The sheer awesomeness of SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ - and let's not forget SPACED - has garnered Simon Pegg a lot of well-deserved fan love. RUN FAT BOY RUN rolls around and it's a romantic comedy and it's a lesser effort, compared to what Pegg's wrought before. Doesn't mean it's not good. It, in fact, is very funny and has a sentimental core and an earnest undercurrent.Simon Pegg is really great at embodying that likable career slacker with whom most of us can identify. It doesn't hurt that Pegg also demonstrates a sharp sense of humor and delivery. The start of RUN FAT BOY RUN showcases Simon Pegg at perhaps his most despicable, his character Dennis Doyle having cold feet on his wedding day and literally running away from his pregnant fiancee Libby (Thandie Newton, perfectly winning). Five years later finds Dennis a bit worse for wear, his life spiraling nowhere. He's put on a bit of weight and, in his security guard gig at a women's clothing store, he has extraordinary amounts of trouble chasing down shoplifters who taunt him as they sprint away. Dennis defensively retorts: ""I'm not fat! I'm unfit!""Worse news. For the past five years Dennis has been trying to get back into his ex-fiancee's good graces, but apparently being abandoned at the altar takes a lot of making up for. Dennis gets along really well with his five-year-old son who easily forgives his dad's bump of irresponsibility, and hanging out with his kid may be the only consistently good thing in Dennis's life. And now there's a new romantic gent in Libby's life and, as played by Hank Azaria, this cat is successful and insufferably smug and obsessed with keeping fit, except that once you hear his name is ""Whit,"" you right away suspect that he may be a bit of a git. Whit has this tradition of running the marathon (which, by the way, Brits pronounce weirdly) and he runs this for charity. Dennis somehow takes it into his brain that if he also can not only run but finish in the same marathon, then this in some way will validate him in Libby's eyes, maybe even win her back. But there is a huge, gaping chasm between intent and action. Dennis is woefully, pathetically out of shape, his motivation very much slacker-sized. The only question seems to be how long before the guy gives up and falls back into his ambition-free habits.RUN FAT BOY RUN is powered by Simon Pegg's presence, but it also really benefits from the other offbeat characters. Dennis Doyle can thank his lucky stars that he has friends as staunch as Gordon (Dylan Moran) and Mr. Goshdashtidar (Harish Patel), no matter that they are pretty unconventional dudes, especially Gordon who seems to disdain wearing bottoms.The film expands beyond its jokey fratboy trappings, somewhere along the way becoming a heartfelt examination of a man who finally gets a good look at himself in the mirror, glimpses the ruins of his life, and realizes that he's run out of excuses. Dennis sets out to better himself, at first often stumbling and faltering but later breaking thru that wall. The film manipulates you, sure, but Simon Pegg is so good at this thing he does that you go along with the cheering and clapping at the proper moments, even if you do see these moments coming early on. And, just for a mo, let's not dwell too much on that, in this picture, competing in a marathon becomes a metaphor for a man's finally fully entering adulthood.

Sure, there is more to it than that, he doesn't fully win her over and her current boyfriend makes himself out to be a jerk, but if you boil it down that is what you get.  For a movie that had a surprising amount of weight about it and more maturity that either Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead (both excellent movies in their own right) I felt that the ending was too childish, even outlandish.  What I expected was that his ex would marry her boyfriend and that Simon's character would be forced to finally grow up, mature, and face the reality that life doesn't always give you what you want but you can still find a way to make things the best that you can.

Newton has a &#34;perfect in every way&#34; boyfriend (played by Hank Azaria) who is getting serious with her, and Pegg wants to win her back by running in the London Marathon (because the boyfriend runs marathons). The story is funny, clean and has a great ending. It lags just a tad in the middle for me (because I am not a fan of sports at ALL (except basketball) and the whole running thing was a bit taxing), but not so much that I would turn it off.

Years later, Dennis is going nowhere as a mall security guard who has never seemed to finish anything he ever started. He has a great relationship with his son, Jake (adorable Matthew Fenton), but Libby clearly sees him as someone she can't/doesn't want to trust.Anyhoo, things are moving along with aching inertia until Dennis finds out Libby is dating Whit (a gleefully Type-A Hank Azaria). Whit is a bigshot in the financial industry and runs marathons for charity in his spare time. To somehow prove to Libby (and himself) that he's no loser, Dennis decides to run the same marathon that Whit's running in. The marathon is less than a month away. Did I mention that Dennis is not very athletic?Everything would have probably fallen to pieces if Dennis' friend, Gordon (a hilarious Dylan Moran), didn't bet everything he owned that Dennis would finish the race. Suddenly, Dennis finds himself with a very motivated personal trainer. And the journey he takes, which happens to be quite a bit longer than the standard 26.2 miles, ends up changing his life.What can I say? I love me some Simon Pegg. There is something so everyman and yet so absolutely endearing about him. And that would be enough, I suppose, except that he has wonderful comic timing and a knack for physical gags.

I like Simon Pegg.Shaun of the Deadis one of the best zombie stories this side of Michael Hemmingson's ""Hardboiled Stiff"" inBADASS HORROR. I think that Hank Azaria is one of the most underrated comedians of the moment. I can even tolerate Thandie Newton and David Schwimmer. Yet, put them all together and you get one of the laziest and crappiest movies of the decade.Now, you might think from the cover and the premise that it might be whimsical; adorable and even a little familiar. It IS familiar after all. Hollywood has been making money producing these arrested manchild movies for years. Sing along if you know this tune - Arrested manchild is on the outs with his girlfriend (ex-girlfriend) and a new guy comes along. Everyone thinks that the new guy (played by Hank Azaria) is awesome but the arrested manchild knows that he's insufferable. Some convoluted contest of wills ensues.Of course, these movies have a comfortable familiarity. The only problem is that you have to actually like the main character. You're supposed to believe that the arrested manchild is capable of becoming a real boy. Simon Pegg did it fine in Shaun, but in this one that character is just a horrible horrible creep. When he leaves his wife at the altar, it's supposed to be funny. When he gets his heart broken, we're supposed to feel sorry for him. When Hank Azaria talks to him, we're supposed to hate Hank Azaria and love Pegg.We don't. Pegg's character never misses an opportunity to prove himself to be a sad little creep, similar to a case study inThe Sociopath Next Door. Nothing about him betrays any hints of responsibility, decency or kindness. Even better, the whole ""running a race"" part of the movie is idiotic since this guy does absolutely no training. Oh haha.

is when Simon is looking at his rival's private parts.Other moments he is jumping into bushes,is in a tree with his son making rude noises to annoy passers by or scratching his privates with a mannequin hand.And,it is yet another story about a recalcitrant father going from a bad place and coming back to win the admiration of his son and his ex.I cannot say there is anything in this film to lift it above the ordinary.The story finds Pegg as an out of shape security guard.It is his wedding day and he's scared stiff about marrying his already pregnant bride.At the last minute he makes a run for it and becomes an instant bachelor with a son who lives and grows up with his mother,and who he sees off and on.Fast forward and Pegg now lives in a basement flat and is behind in his rent.His best friend is his ex's cousin and he is a heavy gambler.Five years have gone by and his wife is now seeing an American(Azaria).Pegg isn't too pleased but there is nothing he can really do.When Pegg finds out that Azaria is running in the London marathon,Pegg decides to also go for it,to impress his ex and son.His ex's cousin bets heavily on him and his Indian landlord also pitches in to help.Now all they need is a sponsor,the only way Pegg can enter the marathon in the less than three week time frame he has.The three try and con a big corporation into supporting them,but when they ask for their charity number it is all over.On the way downstairs the wheel chair they were using gets away from them and it hits a man.It turns out the man was going to be running the marathon but can't now.Pegg gets his sponsor,the erectile dysfunction association.Pegg's training continues but at a party his ex is proposed to by Azaria and she accepts.Disgusted Pegg calls it all off.However a talk with his son later,and persuasion by his friend who is in debt up to his eyeballs,and the marathon is back on.The day of the race comes and Pegg barely makes it on time.Pegg starts trying to pull away from the pack but Azaria keeps up with him.Azaria trips Pegg and they both go down.Azaria ends up in the hospital while Pegg decides to carry on,with a sprained ankle.It takes him many hours but he manages to make it to the end,with a bevy of reporters and supporters with him all the way.The film ends as Pegg is enjoying his new healthy life style(he runs everyday now) and seems on the verge of getting back together with his ex.There are very few laughs in this film,and goodness knows Pegg tries his best with what he has.But most of humour elicits mostly slight smiles and nothing much more.And of course there has to be a bad guy and a""serious"" side to the story,but it is all contrived and been there,done that stuff.I had to shake my head at the scene where the three are leaving the corporation and the wheel chair goes down the steps.We knew it was going to hit someone or something,but when the fellow they hit says he was a runner,had a sponsor and couldn't run,well...that was about as contrived and unimaginative as it comes.The film is chock full of stuff like this.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include a featurette,commentary,deleted scenes,a gag reel and the trailer.Both w/s and full screen versions are on this disc.All in all a disappointing Pegg effort.The script is mundane and the jokes,on the

There are lines of humor and jokes in this film that hint at the playful spirit shown in those earlier films, but as a whole this movie is much more in the ""charming"" category where those films were done in a different manner entirely.  Perhaps the difference is David Schwimmer's direction, perhaps it's the screen play, or perhaps Pegg was intentionally aiming for charming in an effort to widen his range and appeal, either way the result here is a film that fans of the earlier movies may be disappointed in.If you can get past the idea that this film is going to be charming, rather than more satirical and crude, well, you find that the result isn't that bad.  5 star material, not so much for me, and really probably more in the 3.5 range overall, but I'm rounding up a bit as I happen to think charming isn't such a bad thing to be.Simon Pegg plays Dennis, a man that ditched his pregnant girlfriend (Libby, played by Thande Newton) at the altar.  Years later he finds himself working as a security guard that can't run more than a few blocks to try to catch the shoplifter that ripped off the shop we works at.  Ah, the difference a few years, many cigarettes and not so healthy eating makes for.Dennis is a not so dependable father to the son that Libby has been raising by herself, and meanwhile Libby has found another potential love interest (played by Hank Azaria) who seems to make Dennis all the more sad over the love he lost.Eventually (not so far along really), Dennis decides that he'll run in the big marathon to impress Libby, not just because he wants to impress her, but because his competitor for Libby's interest is going to run in the event.  Can a guy whose life is such a mess, not to mention the lack of being physically fit, actually run a marathon?  That's what you'll be watching to find out. :-)There are several crude jokes mixed into the film along the way, and several minutes of the same mixed into the outtakes that are included on the Blu-ray disc.  Nothing that is that harsh, but those that are easily offended should consider themselves warned.  A few instances of rough language also help get the film that rating it sports, so again if you are easily offended perhaps you're better off looking elsewhere.Picture quality on the Blu-ray is nice.  The soundtrack is enjoyable and the musical selections that are included fit nicely where they are placed.  Give this romantic comedy a chance to charm you and you may find it more of a winner than you expected.

1112432,A2VOSR1A3MLFKM,B000WXDMLE,"The Captain ""Bounty628""","[1, 2]","Perhaps Runaway Bride starring Julia Roberts gave a launch to the premonition that many people just before a wedding is set to kick off head for the door and run down the street leaving the wedding and the relationship associated with it all behind.In the movie Run Fatboy Run, this time it is not an anxious bride that leaves her beau waiting at the altar, rather it is the groom who decides that all he can possibly do just before he is set to be married is make a bolt for the door and run. Though not athletic by any stretch of the imagination, Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) comes to the realization that perhaps marriage simply is not for him and his only solution is to make like Forrest Gump and keep on running.Directed by David Schwimmer, the majority of the movie does not focus on Dennis' decision to leave his lovely bride-to-be Libbie Odell (Thandie Newton) at the altar and instead is more about Dennis' life after he loses the chance to marry Libbie.Libbie and Dennis have a son Jake (Matthew Fenton) together and Jake's time spent with each of them is split like so many children with separated parents. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Dennis might think that one day he and Libbie will reconnect but it seems as though Libbie might have different thoughts.With neither Libbie nor Dennis have dated after their split, Libbie decides that perhaps five years was long enough for her to move on with her life. She begins to date Whit (Hank Azaria) who is perhaps as different from Dennis as one could get. Unlike Dennis, Whit has a high-paying white collar job, loves the attention that comes with prestige and also likes to run, not from the altar but for fun.The tenuous relationship between Whit and Dennis needless to say is a rocky one as they each are competing for Libbie in one way or another. Awkwardly, Dennis is competing to show Libbie the past and Whit is Libbie's present and hopeful future. So when Whit tells Dennis that he is running the London Marathon, Dennis basically shrugs it off as no big deal and brags that he could run the marathon, as well.Run Fatboy Run is a very good comedy film that shows how sometimes one's intended machismo might run directly contrary to reality. See, Whit is in shape, has run marathons before and has the drive to actually complete a marathon. Dennis wears outdated track shorts and gets winded running to the end of the block initially.Though there are certain failures and shortcomings along Dennis' training regimen, his passion to run the London Marathon for perhaps no other reason than to throw it in Whit's face burns strong. It also seems as though Dennis is out to prove something to both Jake and Libbie that he is a good and dedicated father and maybe should be given another chance.The ending of the movie is nothing completely unexpected so please don't be hoping for a major surprise awaiting you at the end of the film. In reality, had the ending of the film not been what it in fact was, that probably would have been quite shocking.There is the right amount of comedy in the film to not make this film too overly sentimental and sappy. Though it certainly at times seems as though it might be more of a non-traditional love story than anything else, thanks largely in part to the acting of Simon Pegg and the direction of Schwimmer the film does not fall prey to the dreaded chick flick category.Run Fatboy Run is a well done comedy film that certainly is worth watching. There are a lot of really good little subplots taking place throughout the film and the British humor at times can make way for an additional chuckle here and there.

It is, however, a decent movie.Simon Pegg plays a guy who left his preggers girlfriend at the altar. Skip forward a few years and he's an out of shape security guard at a mall. His ex-girlfriend is seeing another man who is in decently good shape--but he's a tool. This kind of sets off some competition in Simon Pegg's character and he decides to get in shape too. Dylan Moran (of Black Books fame) plays a friend that has a gambling problem, and has bet that Simon's character can finish a marathon. ...and Simon's trying ever-so-hard to get his woman back, which he realizes he should have never left, while training like mad to be able to do this marathon run.I thought the best scenes were the ones with Dylan Moran in them. He basically plays the same character he did in Black Books (which is a great 3 season BBC show... Check it out!). Simon Pegg is pretty good in this, but it's not the same as you're probably used to from this actor.It's worth a watch, but you may never watch it again. Once will probably be enough for you.

Dietrich ""WD""","[1, 2]","When I heard the title, I picuted a character like Chris Farley played in Tommy Boy,who tries to run a marathon while eating chips and drinking beer.  That is not what this film is about.  First the character Dennis does not even appear to be obese so lets change the title to Run Loser Run.The film starts out with the back story of how the main character Dennis panics on his wedding day and leaves his beautiful wife to be (Libby)behind (who is also pregnant).  You see the main character runnning which leads you to believe that he will continue to be a runner?  Turns out the rest of his life he is a loser who still is in love with his ex.  It takes her falling for a very succesful man who appears to be a real winner to get Dennis to confront his feelings.  Dennis gets the idea that if he can beat his foe in a race than Libby will see that he (Dennis is also a winner who is worthy of her love).  Along the way the new boyfriend shows his true colors and thus you really start to hope Dennis can win Libby back.The movie was an enjoyable watch but very predicatble.
