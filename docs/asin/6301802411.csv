In HELL TO ETERNITY the focus is on a man who is neither brave nor cowardly.  He is no Henry Fleming dreaming of great exploits.  Rather he is a man driven by hate for the same people whom earlier he had once called his own. He is Guy Gabaldon, a real life U. S. Marine who won several decorations for valor fighting the Japanese on Saipan.The movie begins with Gabaldon as a boy living in a troubled street in Los Angeles.  He is homeless, friendless, and more than a little filled with rage at a world that has no place for a poor boy of mixed Hispanic origin.  A Japanese family sees worth in him, and much as Don Corleone did with Tom Hagen in THE GODFATHER, agree to take him in and raise him as one of their own.  The adult Gabaldon is played by Jeffrey Hunter, who has the uneviable task of playing Gabaldon at varying times in a psychologically varying condition.  Gabaldon learns to speak fluent Japanese and his face beams with delight as he addresses  his adopted matriarch as 'Mama-san.'  Life in the United States is indeed sweet, at least until Pearl Harbor, when he is swept up into the maelstrom of war.  He does not relish the thought of fighting his adopted people, and he suffers greatly from the image of shooting at Japanese soldiers. During his initial introduction to training, he is befriended by a pre-Fugitive David Janssen, who shows him the ropes of being a soldier.  Gabaldon learns to count on Janssen as a soldier, a friend, savior.  During a vicious battle, Gabaldon sees Janssen gunned down right in front of him, and at that point, his world view is turned upside down. He now hates the Japanese with a ferocity that amazes even his friends.  He uses his fluency in Japanese to lure them out of their lairs, and he guns them down by the hundreds.  His hate drives him on until he meets a Japanese officer played by the immensely dignified Sessue Hayakawa, whose personal bravery restores Gabaldon's emotional equilibrium.HELL TO ETERNITY is the rare war movie whose focus on killing is not to showcase either the fighting skills of the individual soldier or to build a national sense of patriotism and warlike fervor.  Instead, director Phil Karlson uses the confusing images of war to mirror the equally confusing turmoil of one man who is called on to shift mental gears once too often.",4,Hell To Eternity: Hatred Is A Three-Edged Sword,1024444800,"06 19, 2002",2002,2464,"['Most', 'movies', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'deal', 'brave', 'men', 'performing', 'heroically', 'expected', 'less', 'heroic', 'men', 'doing', 'unexpected', 'HELL', 'TO', 'ETERNITY', 'focus', 'man', 'who', 'brave', 'cowardly', 'Henry', 'Fleming', 'dreaming', 'great', 'exploits', 'man', 'driven', 'hate', 'same', 'people', 'whom', 'earlier', 'had', 'once', 'called', 'own', 'Guy', 'Gabaldon', 'real', 'life', 'U.', 'S.', 'Marine', 'who', 'won', 'several', 'decorations', 'valor', 'fighting', 'Japanese', 'Saipan.The', 'movie', 'Gabaldon', 'boy', 'living', 'troubled', 'street', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'homeless', 'friendless', 'more', 'little', 'filled', 'rage', 'world', 'place', 'poor', 'boy', 'mixed', 'Hispanic', 'origin', 'Japanese', 'family', 'sees', 'worth', 'much', 'Don', 'Corleone', 'did', 'Tom', 'Hagen', 'THE', 'GODFATHER', 'agree', 'take', 'raise', 'one', 'own', 'adult', 'Gabaldon', 'played', 'Jeffrey', 'Hunter', 'who', 'uneviable', 'task', 'playing', 'Gabaldon', 'varying', 'times', 'psychologically', 'varying', 'condition', 'Gabaldon', 'speak', 'fluent', 'Japanese', 'face', 'beams', 'delight', 'adopted', 'matriarch', ""'Mama-san"", 'Life', 'United', 'States', 'indeed', 'sweet', 'least', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'when', 'swept', 'up', 'maelstrom', 'war', 'not', 'relish', 'thought', 'fighting', 'adopted', 'people', 'greatly', 'image', 'shooting', 'Japanese', 'soldiers', 'initial', 'introduction', 'training', 'befriended', 'pre-Fugitive', 'David', 'Janssen', 'who', 'ropes', 'being', 'soldier', 'Gabaldon', 'count', 'Janssen', 'soldier', 'friend', 'savior', 'vicious', 'battle', 'Gabaldon', 'Janssen', 'gunned', 'down', 'right', 'front', 'point', 'world', 'view', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'now', 'Japanese', 'ferocity', 'even', 'friends', 'fluency', 'Japanese', 'lure', 'lairs', 'down', 'hundreds', 'hate', 'Japanese', 'officer', 'played', 'immensely', 'dignified', 'Sessue', 'Hayakawa', 'personal', 'bravery', 'Gabaldon', 'emotional', 'equilibrium.HELL', 'TO', 'ETERNITY', 'rare', 'war', 'movie', 'focus', 'killing', 'not', 'showcase', 'either', 'fighting', 'skills', 'individual', 'soldier', 'build', 'national', 'sense', 'patriotism', 'warlike', 'fervor', 'Instead', 'director', 'Phil', 'Karlson', 'confusing', 'images', 'war', 'mirror', 'equally', 'confusing', 'turmoil', 'one', 'man', 'who', 'called', 'shift', 'mental', 'gears', 'once', 'too', 'often']",N/A

This American has a special history or relationship with the Japanese, and his adoption by a good Japanese-American family, the effect of Pearl Harbor on himself and that family, and his experience of the Japanese he has both lived-with and had to fight against on Saipan Island battle are what make this above-average Pacific-war saga based on US Marine Guy Gabaldons personal story and war experience a little different from the run of the mill genre. Good supporting-cast with David Jansen, his gambling and broads loving buddy whose luck runs out finally on Saipan, sadly.This man Guy Gabaldon would proudly agree with my description of him as an American, Im pretty-confidant.This movie is about Americans and Japanese,its not about Germans, or Polish people,or Swedes, or Russians,or Italians,or British or Irish or even, would you believe,and this may be more than you can handle, but its not about wonderful  Spanish or Mexican people, or modern race-politics in the US and trivial PC touchiness,  its about an American Marine and the Japanese.I tell you this as a non-American myself, if I can see it, so should practically anybody else.",4,I too would like to clear a couple of things up...,1073952000,"01 13, 2004",2004,1198,"['movie', 'American', 'Pacific', 'War', 'American', 'special', 'history', 'relationship', 'Japanese', 'adoption', 'good', 'Japanese-American', 'family', 'effect', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'family', 'experience', 'Japanese', 'lived-with', 'had', 'fight', 'Saipan', 'Island', 'battle', 'are', 'what', 'make', 'above-average', 'Pacific-war', 'saga', 'based', 'US', 'Marine', 'Guy', 'Gabaldons', 'personal', 'story', 'war', 'experience', 'little', 'different', 'run', 'mill', 'genre', 'Good', 'supporting-cast', 'David', 'Jansen', 'gambling', 'broads', 'loving', 'buddy', 'luck', 'out', 'finally', 'Saipan', 'sadly.This', 'man', 'Guy', 'Gabaldon', 'would', 'proudly', 'agree', 'description', 'American', 'Im', 'pretty-confidant.This', 'movie', 'Americans', 'Japanese', 'not', 'Germans', 'Polish', 'people', 'Swedes', 'Russians', 'Italians', 'British', 'Irish', 'even', 'would', 'believe', 'may', 'be', 'more', 'can', 'handle', 'not', 'wonderful', 'Spanish', 'Mexican', 'people', 'modern', 'race-politics', 'US', 'trivial', 'PC', 'touchiness', 'American', 'Marine', 'Japanese.I', 'tell', 'non-American', 'myself', 'can', 'see', 'so', 'should', 'practically', 'anybody', 'else']",N/A

The acting by todays standard seems sort of klutzy, but those of us old enough to remember the war and post war America will be jolted by reminders of what kind of society we once were.  Everything from drive ins, to kitchen scenes reveal that America has come a long way.The portrayal of the Japanese family that adopted Guy Galbaldi (in real life the Nakano family) was lumpy in places, but overall captured the spirit that the film director wanted.  That fact that Mr. Galbaldi saved/captured 1,500 Japanese on Saipan (and therefore indirectly saving many American lives) needs a follow up.
