I expected an intense and creepy thriller, but it doesn't really deliver. The music playing during the opening credits make itseems like it's going to be a scary movie, and then the beginning starts. It moves at an extremely slow pace, and I was okay with it. More and more of the story and character development comes in and finally, some of the scares come in. It doesn't really do much until you hear the mothman, who's name is Indrid Cold. I thought it sounded scary and later on you find out it didn't come from human vocal cords, and after that they don't explain anything. What was it then?

699111,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B0000648X0,A Customer,"[1, 5]","Sucked me in.Summary:John Klein (Richard Gere) is a DC reporter whose wife, Mary Klein (Debra Messing), dies but not before drawing numerous pictures of the 'moth-like' creature that she saw just before hitting her head in a car accident.  John ends up single and disturbed by his wife's death.  On his way to an interview in Richmond, VA with the governor (I think) he somehow ends up in Point Pleasant, WV.  While there he becomes embroiled in the ever-increasing intrigue caused by sightings of a moth-like figure and other strange occurrences.  John teams up with Connie Parker (Laura Linney) to try to figure out what is going on but doesn't put things together until he talks with a former physics professor who had a similar experience.John cries wolf when the mayor he was supposed to be interviewing in Richmond decides to tour the chemical plant in Point Pleasant, but nothing happens.  A couple of days later John is on his way back to Point Pleasant when traffic gets stuck on the bridge crossing the Ohio River.  John finally puts it together and realizes that the bridge is going to give way.  He does his best to warn people and eventually ends up saving Connie, but 36 other people die.My Comments:Apparently this is based events that lead up to the collapse of the Silver Point bridge in Point Pleasant, WV in 1966.  In light of that, the movie was pretty interesting.  Sadly, the DVD doesn't have any special features that give any more information on the events that it is based on, which is one strike against it.As for the movie itself, I was very intrigued and was sucked into the movie.  Richard Gere was pretty good and the other actors were good as well.  I was thinking that Debra Messing would have a bigger role, but she is only in the first five minutes or so (with occasional flashes of her throughout the rest).  Despite enjoying the movie, I didn't particularly like the special effects that made things hard to see and hear at times.  There was a lot of static and a lot of bright flashes.  Understandably the director is trying to depict a vague phenomenon, but it probably wasn't necessary to make everything so hard to understand.Overall, the movie was enjoyable and I would recommend it for anyone interested in the supernatural.",3,Entertaining but not superb,1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,2266,"['Sucked', 'in.Summary', 'John', 'Klein', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'DC', 'reporter', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Klein', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'dies', 'not', 'drawing', 'numerous', 'pictures', ""'moth-like"", 'creature', 'saw', 'just', 'hitting', 'head', 'car', 'accident', 'John', 'up', 'single', 'disturbed', 'wife', 'death', 'way', 'interview', 'Richmond', 'VA', 'governor', 'think', 'somehow', 'up', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'WV', 'embroiled', 'ever-increasing', 'intrigue', 'caused', 'sightings', 'moth-like', 'figure', 'other', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'John', 'up', 'Connie', 'Parker', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'going', ""n't"", 'put', 'things', 'together', 'former', 'physics', 'professor', 'who', 'had', 'similar', 'experience.John', 'cries', 'wolf', 'when', 'mayor', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'interviewing', 'Richmond', 'decides', 'tour', 'chemical', 'plant', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'nothing', 'happens', 'couple', 'days', 'later', 'John', 'way', 'back', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'when', 'traffic', 'stuck', 'bridge', 'crossing', 'Ohio', 'River', 'John', 'finally', 'together', 'bridge', 'going', 'give', 'way', 'best', 'warn', 'people', 'eventually', 'up', 'saving', 'Connie', '36', 'other', 'people', 'die.My', 'Comments', 'Apparently', 'based', 'events', 'lead', 'up', 'collapse', 'Silver', 'Point', 'bridge', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'WV', '1966', 'light', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'Sadly', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'features', 'give', 'more', 'information', 'events', 'based', 'one', 'strike', 'it.As', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'intrigued', 'was', 'sucked', 'movie', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'other', 'actors', 'were', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'was', 'thinking', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'would', 'have', 'bigger', 'role', 'only', 'first', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'rest', 'enjoying', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'particularly', 'special', 'effects', 'made', 'things', 'hard', 'see', 'hear', 'times', 'was', 'lot', 'static', 'lot', 'bright', 'flashes', 'Understandably', 'director', 'trying', 'depict', 'vague', 'phenomenon', 'probably', 'was', ""n't"", 'necessary', 'make', 'everything', 'so', 'hard', 'understand.Overall', 'movie', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'would', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'supernatural']",N/A

699114,A3M8H644ON5FQD,B0000648X0,Amazon Customer,"[11, 12]","Okay: this is a movie that I had been avoiding for quite some time because of all the poor word-of-mouth it seems to have received. I'm not a fan of Richard Gere, and I do not care for modern fare such as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" or the countless Jason and ""Halloween"" re-hashings. I am, admittedly, a person that is VERY difficult to please in the whole ""horror"" experience. That said, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. A lot. Perhaps the fact I wasn't expecting much helped me enjoy it more, but I honestly feel the film's merits had more to do with that than any state of mind I may have been in. This is the first movie in quite some time that has genuinely creeped me out to the point where I actually turned the lights OFF so that I could revel in that all-too-seldom experience. I did not find it slow, or overly-long, or boring in any respect. And I'm not even claiming ownership of a wider than average attention span. My honest opinion as to why so many people seem to have been turned off by this movie is the fact that at some undiscernible point in the movie, it stops being a horror movie and starts becoming something else. A bold move, in my opinion, which unfortunately seems to have alienated the movie-going throngs hungry for your typical violent, bloody, lame climax. ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a movie that should satisfy anyone with an imagination who longs for the days when scary movies were actually scary, and should rightfully displease those whose idea of a good scare is only equivalent to the splatter-content therein.

699115,A2RNUR847O8EHZ,B0000648X0,Amazon Customer,"[2, 4]","With ""based on a true story"" as a slugging slogan, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES flew onto big screens to an expectant audience packed with wide-eyed thrill-seekers.  While the MOTHMAN may not have fluttered along as rapidly as many may have hoped, thrills, chills and trepidation certainly weren't swatted out of the tension-filled air.  Rather, suspense was the stylish sensation of the evening.The basic synopsis of the story revolves around a moth-like creature that started showing up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia making predictions about terrible things to come.  When the dreary forecasts began coming true, the townsfolk started to get more than a little worried.  A writer for the Washington Post wound up mysteriously in the not-so-sleepy settlement and started asking questions, like any good journalist should.  Well, the answers he found fly his mind in the face of terror.For many reasons, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES more than adequately fulfilled its role as a thriller.  It was scary, it made the spectators jump, and the story kept the audience guessing but wasn't more ludicrous than any mystery/horror flick should be.  One spooky aspect involved THE MOTHMAN itself.  Though you never really get a good shot of the star specter, drawings and rough sketches that depict THE MOTHMAN were anything but jolly.  Meanwhile, the static/voice gibberish of the creature was something you would never want to hear on the end of the telephone line.  The camera effects used to simulate what the ghoul is ""seeing"" are eerie and effective.  Cheesiness was left on the fly swatter, and the clich&eacute;d concept of corny doesn't factor into this spookster.  It was like a good episode of THE X-FILES.While the account was ""based on a true story,"" many elements were added and distorted to create something more Hollywood for the kids at home. Unlike typical thrillers, however, this story manages to somehow keep you wondering what will happen next or what the point of THE MOTHMAN's predictions is.  Why does the phantom act as a harbinger of terror at all?  This question stays on your mind throughout the flick and is answered and unanswered in very class fashion.In THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, Director Mark Pellington (ARLINGTON ROAD) exploited the same duo of Richard Gere and Laura Linney that Director Gregory Hoblit used in the legal/psychological thriller PRIMAL FEAR also co-starring Edward Norton.  In MOTHMAN, Gere (PRIMAL FEAR; FINAL ANALYSIS; AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMEN) starred as the grieving widower and Washington Post Journalist John Klein.  His search for answers and especially his evolving emotional and psychological state were the drive behind this movie.  Laura Linney was crucial as the voice of reason and as the amorous distraction that kept the horror of THE MOTHMAN from dominating the picture.  Gere and Linney made a fantastic combo by convincing the crowd that there is an honest bit of romance between them, an essential and rare factor in films these days.For the most part, THE MOTHMAN completed the mission.  It was scary and intriguing.  However, there were a few unanswered questions that might make some kids a little skeptical.  Also, the validity of this MOTHMAN and its premonitions was incredulous at times.Overall, the film was a winner.  The movie-lovers might not be returning to theaters time and time again for double-takes, but they'll probably rent it on DVD in a few months and recommend it to their friends.  The fear factor necessary for any good suspense thriller is more than prevalent.  And, THE MOTHMAN  is just mysterious enough to make you want to get a 10-foot bug zapper for the back porch.",4,"MOTHMANIA Might Not Set In, But It's A Thriller Nonetheless",1077840000,"02 27, 2004",2004,3648,"['based', 'true', 'story', 'slugging', 'slogan', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'flew', 'big', 'screens', 'expectant', 'audience', 'packed', 'wide-eyed', 'thrill-seekers', 'MOTHMAN', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'fluttered', 'as', 'rapidly', 'many', 'may', 'have', 'hoped', 'thrills', 'chills', 'trepidation', 'certainly', 'were', ""n't"", 'swatted', 'tension-filled', 'air', 'suspense', 'was', 'stylish', 'sensation', 'evening.The', 'basic', 'synopsis', 'story', 'around', 'moth-like', 'creature', 'started', 'showing', 'up', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'West', 'Virginia', 'making', 'predictions', 'terrible', 'things', 'come', 'When', 'dreary', 'forecasts', 'began', 'coming', 'true', 'townsfolk', 'started', 'get', 'more', 'little', 'worried', 'writer', 'Washington', 'Post', 'wound', 'up', 'mysteriously', 'not-so-sleepy', 'settlement', 'started', 'asking', 'questions', 'good', 'journalist', 'should', 'Well', 'answers', 'found', 'fly', 'mind', 'face', 'terror.For', 'many', 'reasons', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'more', 'adequately', 'fulfilled', 'role', 'thriller', 'was', 'scary', 'made', 'spectators', 'jump', 'story', 'kept', 'audience', 'guessing', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'ludicrous', 'mystery/horror', 'flick', 'should', 'be', 'One', 'spooky', 'aspect', 'involved', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'good', 'shot', 'star', 'specter', 'drawings', 'rough', 'sketches', 'depict', 'MOTHMAN', 'were', 'anything', 'jolly', 'Meanwhile', 'static/voice', 'gibberish', 'creature', 'was', 'something', 'would', 'never', 'want', 'hear', 'end', 'telephone', 'line', 'camera', 'effects', 'used', 'simulate', 'what', 'ghoul', 'seeing', 'are', 'eerie', 'effective', 'Cheesiness', 'was', 'left', 'fly', 'swatter', 'clich', 'eacute', 'concept', 'corny', ""n't"", 'factor', 'spookster', 'was', 'good', 'episode', 'THE', 'X-FILES.While', 'account', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'many', 'elements', 'were', 'added', 'distorted', 'create', 'something', 'more', 'Hollywood', 'kids', 'home', 'Unlike', 'typical', 'thrillers', 'however', 'story', 'somehow', 'keep', 'wondering', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'what', 'point', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'predictions', 'Why', 'phantom', 'act', 'harbinger', 'terror', 'question', 'mind', 'flick', 'answered', 'unanswered', 'very', 'class', 'fashion.In', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'ARLINGTON', 'ROAD', 'exploited', 'same', 'duo', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'Director', 'Gregory', 'Hoblit', 'used', 'legal/psychological', 'thriller', 'PRIMAL', 'FEAR', 'also', 'co-starring', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'MOTHMAN', 'Gere', 'PRIMAL', 'FEAR', 'FINAL', 'ANALYSIS', 'AN', 'OFFICER', 'A', 'GENTLEMEN', 'starred', 'grieving', 'widower', 'Washington', 'Post', 'Journalist', 'John', 'Klein', 'search', 'answers', 'especially', 'evolving', 'emotional', 'psychological', 'state', 'were', 'drive', 'movie', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'was', 'crucial', 'voice', 'reason', 'amorous', 'distraction', 'kept', 'horror', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'dominating', 'picture', 'Gere', 'Linney', 'made', 'fantastic', 'combo', 'convincing', 'crowd', 'honest', 'bit', 'romance', 'essential', 'rare', 'factor', 'films', 'days.For', 'most', 'part', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'completed', 'mission', 'was', 'scary', 'intriguing', 'However', 'were', 'few', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'might', 'make', 'kids', 'little', 'skeptical', 'Also', 'validity', 'MOTHMAN', 'premonitions', 'was', 'incredulous', 'times.Overall', 'film', 'was', 'winner', 'movie-lovers', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'returning', 'theaters', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'double-takes', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'rent', 'DVD', 'few', 'months', 'recommend', 'friends', 'fear', 'factor', 'necessary', 'good', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'more', 'prevalent', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'just', 'mysterious', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'get', '10-foot', 'bug', 'zapper', 'back', 'porch']",N/A

699118,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0000648X0,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","`The Sixth Sense', that 1999 blockbuster (groundbreaking if you will) smash hit that earned a ridiculous amount of Oscar attention for a film of it's genre, spawned a huge heap of copycat films that tried very hard to build off the foundation that M. Night Shyamalan created.  Some of then soared (`The Others'), some of them flopped (`Dragonfly') and some of them fell somewhere in the middle.I think `the middle' is a good place for `The Mothman Prophesies'.Coming off like an incomplete mixture of `The Sixth Sense' and `The Blair Witch Project', `The Mothman Prophesies' has quite a bit going for it, but it also throws a lot of its promise away by failing to develop its themes to a stronger degree.John Klein is a grieving widower/journalist who has become consumed with a mysterious urban legend involving a creepy creature known as the Mothman.  With strange prophesies and even stranger `occurrences', Klein stays in Point Pleasant, West Virginia for far too long looking for answers that are never going to come.I am all about ambiguity, and I like open endings, but there is something about `The Mothman Prophesies' that feels incomplete.  The concept here is quite fascinating, but it feels largely underdeveloped, even with the intensity surrounding the films climax (which I can still see vividly in my minds eye).  The character development found in the likes of John Klein (portrayed with brooding sincerity by Richard Gere) is rather outstanding for a film that fails to tie up any loose ends, but he is the only facet of the film that feels as though it received a fair deal.  The Mothman, who should have received the bulk of the attention, seems to fall to the wayside here.

You've got to cheer a director who's willing to make a film, where, in the end, nothing is explained.  Because it's not.  You still don't know at the end what the hell was going on or why anything happened the way it did.  And that's fine with me; because it's not the point with this movie.  The point was the thrill ride and creepy, paranoid tone that takes hold once Gere ends up in that West Virginia town.Like he did in Arlington Road, Pellington knows how to make the most out of menacing little details.  Whether it's strange lights that appear for a split-second in the sky after Gere's car breaks down, or the blink-and-you'll miss it reflection in a mirror on a door that Gere slams, there's plenty of subliminal stuff here to add to the doom and gloom feel that gets increasingly intense.If you need your thrillers to go from A to B to C, you may not like the unresolved conclusion, but if you want some real chills--even more chilling because almost all of this stuff really happened--you can't do better than this.The best scene in the movie involves Gere's character on the phone talking to somebody who may or may not exist, who creepily begins to tell him things about him that nobody could possibly know, and then it accelerates from there.

While it has some elements of John Keel's story, it is a total departure from what supposedly really happened.I first heard about the Mothman in some obscure UFO rag in the 1970s. It is an interesting story of a town visited by a giant flying creature, the real Men-in-Black, and an alien (Indrid Cold) over a period of time. All this strangness culminates in a bridge collapse that killed a number of people. Afterward, life returned to normal for this small town in West Virginia.John Keel heard of the sightings at the time they were occurring and visited the town and befriended a number of people who witnessed the various phenomena. There were many strange things going on indeed, phones ringing with mechanical voices on the other end, UFOs being seen, cars being chased at 100 MPH by a huge winged creature and strange looking men in black suits asking people weird questions. Keel himself experienced some of the weirdness when a phone started ringing that was not plugged in. He also on numerous occasions heard someone banging on the wall, even though there was no one there.The movie, with a present day timeline (VS the 1960s) casts Richard Gere as Keel's character. So right off from the start the movie strays from the ""real"" story. There are some elements that are supposedly true. The Mothman was seen by numerous people on roofs and in yards like in the movie. Gere sees a strange light in the sky and has ""missing"" time. There were strange lights seen in the sky during the Mothman time period. Indrid Cold, an ""alien"" appeared to at least one individual in the real story. In the movie he is calling Keel and almost is used like a fusion of the real story of Indrid Cold and the MIB seen all over town.The movie has good acting and you do get this feeling of something weird is going on. It definately has a creepy atmosphere, probably due to most scenes being shoot in winter with overcast skies or at night. I have to say that without a doubt this DVD has one of the best Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks of any DVD I have seen (including the Matix, ID4 and Armageddon). I had seen this at the movies and when I got the DVD I watched it in broad daylight, with the volume turned up a notch, and the first scene with the Mothman/car crash still made me jump out of my seat.If you know the story and realize that this movie only touches on a few aspects of it you most likely enjoy it.

699129,A2XFII4E73279L,B0000648X0,"Charles Justus Garard ""Charles J. Garard Jr. PhD""","[2, 2]","Although I am a professor of literature, I have often been a fan both of classic horror films and of studies in the paranormal. I have been known to write reviews of horror films and even to contribute an article to the Atlantic Paranormal Society publication about supposedly real creatures in Indonesia.  I am an avid fan of the COAST TO COAST AM radio program and Psychic Radio from Detroit, heard here in China on AOL Radio.  However, I have not, to this point, written my thoughts about THE MOTHMAN PROPHECY, a film that straddles the line between being an old-fashioned (non-violent) horror film that suggests more than it shows . . . and a film about psychic predictions that are extremely eerie when they are shown to be true.If I had to list my favorite horror film of all time -- and that includes a broad spectrum of classics reaching from Hammer horror films to THE INNOCENTS and the Italian film BLACK SUNDAY-- I would place THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES at the top. It works successfully on a level that no other film I have seen quite approaches. If one wants suspense and ambiguities instead of blood-dripping gore (in a genre made popular by Dario Argento), if one wants to see characters (portrayed by Richard Gere and Laura Linney) who are as perplexed as we are because they keep encountering more questions than answers, one could do far worse than spending time with Mark Pellington's skillfully directed cinematic masterpiece. Each camera placement (from extreme close-ups of Richard Gere's ear to compelling aerial shots) is perfection.  One would be hard-pressed to find a more suspenseful scene than the one where Gere talks on the phone to a mothman named Indrid Cold in his motel room. When Gere thinks he sees his dead wife in his motel room bed, I literally jumped in my theatre seat and almost lost all of the popcorn from the bag balanced on my lap. After seeing such films as EVIL DEAD, I was pretty sure that nothing in a horror film could still catch me off-guard and push the ""surprise"" button. I was wrong.What makes this film a classic in suspense is the fact that not all of the frightening scenes are directly related to any mothman creature. If predictions that amazingly come true are compelling to those of us fascinated by psychics and their prophecies, perhaps it is because what we don't see that is more important than what we are shown. Pellington knows how to appeal to our sense of wonder, knowing that what we conjure up in our imaginations will remain with us longer than images of CGI monsters and men in creature suits. After seeing this film, I could not help comparing it to other similar films released at about the same time, such as SIGNS, DRAGONFLY, and Stephen King's DREAMCATCHER.  While THE RING (the Canadian remake as opposed to the Japanese original) comes close with some frightening scenes, the others are luke-warm and flat by comparison with MOTHMAN. A close runner-up in the fright department is the Michael Keaton film WHITE NOISE, perhaps because this is based on actual paranormal research with EVPs, just as THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is based on actual reported sightings in Point Pleasant WV and the real-life collapse of the Silver Bridge in the late 1960s.According to John Keel's book based on his investigations and reports heard on COAST TO COAST AM (and even shown in the on-the-spot recorded investigations of the TV series PARANORMAL STATE), these mothman entities have been seen elsewhere in the world (even in Asia) and have occasionally been seen again in the Point Pleasant area. Perhaps not enough evidence yet exists to prove that these creatures actually share the planet with humans and animals (as a scene featuring venerable British actor Alan Bates suggests), the realization that down-to-earth West Virginia residents have reported seeing them adds a deft touch of verisimilitude to the proceedings.",5,The paranormal meets the creature features,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,3885,"['am', 'professor', 'literature', 'have', 'often', 'been', 'fan', 'classic', 'horror', 'films', 'studies', 'paranormal', 'have', 'been', 'known', 'write', 'reviews', 'horror', 'films', 'even', 'contribute', 'article', 'Atlantic', 'Paranormal', 'Society', 'publication', 'supposedly', 'real', 'creatures', 'Indonesia', 'am', 'avid', 'fan', 'COAST', 'TO', 'COAST', 'AM', 'radio', 'program', 'Psychic', 'Radio', 'Detroit', 'heard', 'here', 'China', 'AOL', 'Radio', 'However', 'have', 'not', 'point', 'written', 'thoughts', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECY', 'film', 'line', 'being', 'old-fashioned', 'non-violent', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'film', 'psychic', 'predictions', 'are', 'extremely', 'eerie', 'when', 'are', 'shown', 'be', 'true.If', 'had', 'list', 'favorite', 'horror', 'film', 'time', 'broad', 'spectrum', 'classics', 'reaching', 'Hammer', 'horror', 'films', 'THE', 'INNOCENTS', 'Italian', 'film', 'BLACK', 'SUNDAY', 'would', 'place', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'top', 'successfully', 'level', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'quite', 'approaches', 'one', 'suspense', 'ambiguities', 'instead', 'blood-dripping', 'gore', 'genre', 'made', 'popular', 'Dario', 'Argento', 'one', 'see', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'are', 'as', 'perplexed', 'are', 'keep', 'encountering', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'one', 'could', 'do', 'far', 'worse', 'spending', 'time', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'skillfully', 'directed', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'camera', 'placement', 'extreme', 'close-ups', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'ear', 'compelling', 'aerial', 'shots', 'perfection', 'One', 'would', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'scene', 'one', 'where', 'Gere', 'talks', 'phone', 'mothman', 'named', 'Indrid', 'Cold', 'motel', 'room', 'When', 'Gere', 'dead', 'wife', 'motel', 'room', 'bed', 'literally', 'jumped', 'theatre', 'seat', 'almost', 'lost', 'popcorn', 'bag', 'balanced', 'lap', 'seeing', 'such', 'films', 'EVIL', 'DEAD', 'was', 'pretty', 'sure', 'nothing', 'horror', 'film', 'could', 'still', 'catch', 'off-guard', 'push', 'surprise', 'button', 'was', 'wrong.What', 'film', 'classic', 'suspense', 'fact', 'not', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'are', 'directly', 'related', 'mothman', 'creature', 'predictions', 'amazingly', 'come', 'true', 'are', 'compelling', 'fascinated', 'psychics', 'prophecies', 'perhaps', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'more', 'important', 'what', 'are', 'shown', 'Pellington', 'how', 'appeal', 'sense', 'wonder', 'knowing', 'what', 'conjure', 'up', 'imaginations', 'will', 'remain', 'longer', 'images', 'CGI', 'monsters', 'men', 'creature', 'suits', 'seeing', 'film', 'could', 'not', 'help', 'comparing', 'other', 'similar', 'films', 'released', 'same', 'time', 'such', 'SIGNS', 'DRAGONFLY', 'Stephen', 'King', 'DREAMCATCHER', 'RING', 'Canadian', 'remake', 'opposed', 'Japanese', 'original', 'close', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'others', 'are', 'luke-warm', 'flat', 'comparison', 'MOTHMAN', 'close', 'runner-up', 'fright', 'department', 'Michael', 'Keaton', 'film', 'WHITE', 'NOISE', 'perhaps', 'based', 'actual', 'paranormal', 'research', 'EVPs', 'just', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'based', 'actual', 'reported', 'sightings', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'WV', 'real-life', 'collapse', 'Silver', 'Bridge', 'late', '1960s.According', 'John', 'Keel', 'book', 'based', 'investigations', 'reports', 'heard', 'COAST', 'TO', 'COAST', 'AM', 'even', 'shown', 'on-the-spot', 'recorded', 'investigations', 'TV', 'series', 'PARANORMAL', 'STATE', 'mothman', 'entities', 'have', 'been', 'seen', 'elsewhere', 'world', 'even', 'Asia', 'have', 'occasionally', 'been', 'seen', 'again', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'area', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'enough', 'evidence', 'yet', 'prove', 'creatures', 'actually', 'share', 'planet', 'humans', 'animals', 'scene', 'featuring', 'venerable', 'British', 'actor', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'realization', 'down-to-earth', 'West', 'Virginia', 'residents', 'have', 'reported', 'seeing', 'deft', 'touch', 'verisimilitude', 'proceedings']",N/A

Though we never really see the &quot;creature&quot; per se, the effects of his prophecies drive the plot of the story.

Klein (Gere) is the star reporter for the Washington Post, he has a new wife, is about to buy a new home, and life is looking good, or so he thinks.  On the way back from purchesing their new home, a freak image appears out of nowhere sending the couple crashing into the snowy embankment.  Klein can't understand what happened, as a few weeks later his wife suddenly and mysteriously dies of a rare brain tumor.  Later he finds himself on a new assignment on the way to Pennsylvania to interview a political candidate when oddly enough, he arrives in Point Pleasant.  The film does offer sometimes very frightening and disturbing images of the ""mothman"" as it is called by its viewees, but altogether it seems to be lacking a fundamental element that makes a good story-a point.  Just like the novel its based on, The Mothman Prophecies is simply a loose collection of harrowing events that take the viewer on a wild (and weird) ride through Point Pleasant- and thats it.  The weird happenings don't add up in the end, and the film doesn't even attempt to give any form of explanation- it simply leaves you hanging.  Some people would argue that the whole point of the film is simply because it does not have one, but I argue- you need a basic solution to any film. One that lacks a solution does not make for a very interesting story. That is because whatever it is you have to say through your film is not confirmed, it is simply lost.  The ending is a pretentious letdown, boring, under developed, and seems like the writers were just too lazy to come up with anything interesting that might have served as a viable explination to the film's intriguing beginning mysteries.",3,UFOs and Weirdos offer small thrill,1025395200,"06 30, 2002",2002,1862,"['Richard', 'Gere', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'based', 'editorial', 'novel', 'John', 'Keel', 'depicting', 'bizarre', 'uncanny', 'events', 'small', 'town', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'West', 'Virginia', 'Klein', 'Gere', 'star', 'reporter', 'Washington', 'Post', 'new', 'wife', 'buy', 'new', 'home', 'life', 'looking', 'good', 'so', 'way', 'back', 'purchesing', 'new', 'home', 'freak', 'image', 'nowhere', 'sending', 'couple', 'crashing', 'snowy', 'embankment', 'Klein', 'ca', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'happened', 'few', 'weeks', 'later', 'wife', 'suddenly', 'mysteriously', 'dies', 'rare', 'brain', 'tumor', 'Later', 'new', 'assignment', 'way', 'Pennsylvania', 'interview', 'political', 'candidate', 'when', 'oddly', 'enough', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'film', 'offer', 'sometimes', 'very', 'frightening', 'disturbing', 'images', 'mothman', 'called', 'viewees', 'altogether', 'be', 'lacking', 'fundamental', 'element', 'good', 'story-a', 'point', 'Just', 'novel', 'based', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'simply', 'loose', 'collection', 'harrowing', 'events', 'take', 'viewer', 'wild', 'weird', 'ride', 'Point', 'Pleasant-', 'thats', 'weird', 'happenings', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'end', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'attempt', 'give', 'form', 'explanation-', 'simply', 'hanging', 'people', 'would', 'argue', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'simply', 'not', 'have', 'one', 'argue-', 'need', 'basic', 'solution', 'film', 'One', 'solution', 'not', 'make', 'very', 'interesting', 'story', 'whatever', 'have', 'say', 'film', 'not', 'confirmed', 'simply', 'lost', 'ending', 'pretentious', 'letdown', 'boring', 'developed', 'writers', 'were', 'just', 'too', 'lazy', 'come', 'up', 'anything', 'interesting', 'might', 'have', 'served', 'viable', 'explination', 'film', 'intriguing', 'beginning', 'mysteries']",N/A

699138,A213KQ65OELF7R,B0000648X0,Commander Adama,"[2, 4]","If you loved the &quot;X-Files&quot; at its best, or films such as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; or &quot;The Others&quot; which placed a premium on creepiness and &quot;playing with your mind&quot;, and a minimum on blood and gore, then I can virtually guarantee that you'll like &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot;. This movie is an updated version of a classic 1975 book which told the supposedly true story about a series of bizarre and frightening events in the little river town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1966 and 1967. Richard Gere (who I thought gave a good performance, unlike some of the other posters here) plays John Klein, a successful and happily-married political reporter for the Washington Post. One cold evening he and his gorgeous wife Mary (Debra Messing of TV's 'Will and Grace') go to view a house in the DC area that they're planning to buy. On the way back to their current home Mary is driving in a residential area on a deserted street when she is shocked to see a huge &quot;man-monster&quot; with wings and glowing red eyes flying straight at their car. John doesn't see the creature, but Mary loses control of the car, they wreck, and she is injured. At the hospital John receives more bad news - Mary has brain tumor and is going to die. After her death he finds a notebook in which Mary has written the word &quot;RUIN&quot; over and over, and has done dozens of chilling drawings of the creature she saw. A couple of years later Klein, still grieving over his wife's death, takes what appears to be a routine trip on the interstate to Richmond, Virginia to interview the state's governor. On the late-night trip he seems to &quot;doze off&quot; for a few seconds, and when he comes to he's no longer on the interstate but a backwoods country road near Point Pleasant, West Virginia - hundreds of miles from his previous location a few moments earlier. His car suddenly dies, and he is forced to walk for help. I won't give away anymore of the plot, but I will say that the characters he meets in Point Pleasant are all very well-played. Among them are Will Patton, who plays a troubled but basically decent man who is slowly being driven insane by the bizarre &quot;Mothman&quot; creature which keeps haunting him at night. Laura Linney is an attractive and down-to-earth deputy sherriff who helps John investigate the &quot;Mothman&quot; sightings in Point Pleasant. Over time she finds herself becoming attracted to him - and becoming increasingly frightened at the supernatural events in her hometown and John's growing obsession with them. Alan Bates gives a perfectly creepy performance as a reclusive college professor in Chicago who knows far more about the &quot;Mothman's&quot; real identity and motivations than he's willing to admit (at least at first). Those who watch the &quot;Mothman Prophecies&quot; expecting to see the creature are in for a disappointment, as he only appears VERY briefly in a few moments of the film - yet this is what gives the &quot;Mothman Prophecies&quot; its chills. By limiting the creature's screen time (at one point the &quot;Mothman&quot; tells Klein over the phone that it can appear to be whatever the individual person viewing it wants to see), it covers the entire movie with an awful sense of foreboding - a sense that something is not quite right in Point Pleasant - and that things are building towards a terrible climax. This &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD set features the superb &quot;Searching for the Mothman&quot; documentary which aired on the FX cable channel just before the movie's release. It features commentary by paranormal researcher John Keel, who wrote the classic 1975 book upon which the movie was based. It also has interviews with Point Pleasant residents who claim they saw the &quot;Mothman&quot; back in 1966 and 1967. In many ways this movie plays like a high-budget, high-quality &quot;X-Files&quot; episode.

The film starts off in late 1999 with Washington Post political reporter John Klein (Gere- 1 of America's hammiest actors) & his wife Mary (Debra Messing from tv's `Will & Grace') looking to buy a house in the DC area. Driving home they are in an accident when Mary swerves off the road after having a vision of some red-eyed creature coming toward their car. She hits her head, is hospitalized, & found to have some tumor that could warp her perceptions. A few weeks later she dies. Gere weeps, but discovers his wife filled a notebook with the creature she saw- some dark angelic being. Gere is solemnity itself. 2 years pass & he's on his way south from DC to go to Richmond, Virginia to interview a possible Presidential candidate: the state's governor. Driving at night he somehow ends up 400 miles west of his destination- in Point Pleasant, West Virginia. His car breaks down & he knocks on the door of a house. Gordon & Denise Smallwood (Will Patton & Lucinda Jenney) answer. Gordon pulls a gun on John & holds him prisoner in his bathtub until town cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney) arrives. She convinces the Smallwoods to let John go. They claim he has harassed them the past few nights. Connie takes John to stay at a motel & the next day his car is towed, but turns out to be in perfect working order. Mysterious music & MTV-like film cuts intone this, & every hum-drum occasion....  This is a film too bad to be good & too good to be so bad it's good. DULL is the watchword, unless watching Richard Gere's Shatnerian reactions to a phone ringing is your idea of edge-of-the-seat horror. That Mothman never makes an appearance would be fine if the film gave us something else, or kept a mystery worth keeping- but nada. & this is perhaps the only `action' film I can recall where a gratuitous love story would have improved the tale. Laura Linney's Connie is the only character developed to any emotional or deep extent, or which induces any concern. She radiates a down-home sensuality, yet John never makes a move, even after saving her. Not even a peck on the cheek.

In doing that, filmmakers unintentionally detracted from their genuinely eerie plot and instead left themselves open to constant, kvetching criticism that ""none of that happened!"" Of course it didn't. This is a movie. Duh. Leaving all that behind, The Mothman Prophecies is a fun film to watch even if it could have sped its pace up a bit. The ""Chap Stick"" scene was one part giggly funny and three parts chills down your back spooky, and it was little moments like those that made the supernatural elements work when they could easily have been overpowered by the investigative overtones that held the story together. I also felt the entire movie was somehow a subtle homage to The X-Files, with Richard Gear coming close to playing up on the old ""Wow, David Duchovny looks like him"" talk, but he was ultimately so upstaged by Laura Linney's performance that it's easy to miss that.

Richard Gere and Laura Linney are just fantastic, and the whole production - writing, directing, cinematography - is top-notch.  In the hands of a lesser cast and crew, this film could easily have been a great big joke of a disaster that would have inspired nothing more than mockery.  After all, the real story of what transpired in Point Pleasant, West Virginia is so bizarre and so outside the range of human experience and knowledge that skeptics basically laugh it off and even many with open minds simply choose to ignore it.Richard Gere plays Washington Post reporter John Klein, who becomes inextricably linked to the Mothman phenomenon through some kind of weird fate.  It begins with the series of drawings made by his terminally ill wife.  Two years later, he somehow impossibly ends up in Point Pleasant while driving in a completely different direction during the night.  If that isn't strange enough, the first person he meets there accuses him of having harassed his family for three nights straight.  Through local cop Connie Mills (Laura Linney), he learns that this is just one of a growing number of strange local reports over the last few days.  He soon finds himself investigating reported sightings of a giant Mothman creature with glowing red eyes terrifying local residents.  One man in particular seems to have a special relationship with the creature and begins reporting predictions from someone or something calling itself Indrid Cole - predictions that quickly come true.  As his obsession with the story - and Cole in particular - grows, heightened by his own questions about his wife's death, Klein becomes convinced that the Mothman is trying to warn him about a great tragedy about to happen.If you like your storylines wrapped up in a nice and understandable little bow, you probably aren't the ideal audience for The Mothman Prophecies.  There are plenty of clues but few answers as to the nature of the phenomenon on display here.  That is largely because there is no real explanation of the true events of 1966-67 that inspired the film.  Of course, the film has taken a certain amount of artistic license with that story - moving it up to ""the present day,"" linking it to other Mothman sightings since the 1960s, and introducing fictional characters such as John Klein and investigator Alexander Leek (obviously a reference to John Keel, the most prominent researcher of the Mothman sightings) - but much of what you see here was reported by those who lived through the actual events in Point Pleasant.  In point of fact, much more of the real story didn't make its way into the film plot - e.g., reported UFO sightings and Men in Black frightening certain townspeople into silence.  What is here, though, proves more than enough to fascinate, captivate, and perhaps even frighten viewers, while the performances of Gere and Linney further imbue this bizarre story with an all-important sense of emotional power and humanity.

699144,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B0000648X0,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[7, 10]","In the dizzyingly action-packed tradition of ""Spider-Man"" and ""The Hulk"", ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is the fast-paced story of the reclusive Mothman, a gossamer-caped crimefighter who swoops down on the Forces of Evil from his secret underground base in the hills of West Virginia.OK, OK, I'm kidding. That's not what the movie is about, I just couldn't help myself.Alright now: ""The Mothman Prophecies"" is a tastily creepy little mood piece that takes hearty helpings of conspiracy theory, precognition, UFO abductions, hauntings from beyond the grave, and Men in Black, throws them in a big cauldron, stirs and seasons with plenty of dark, brooding, atmosphere, and serves it up with a whallop.And what a whallop! If you're looking for 8-foot tall Mothmen swooping down from the trees and carrying of their screaming victims, then you should look elsewhere, because that's not what this deliciously spooky film is all about. But ""The Mothman Prophecies"" snuck up on me, whalloped me with its unrelenting creepiness, and left me confused, spooked, and wanting more, and really---what more can you ask of a film?""Mothman"" centers on the strange adventure of its grieving widower hero John Klein (played---erm, affably by Richard Geere), a Washington Post reporter and political analyst. Two years after his wife dies of a brain tumor following a mysterious car accident, he is dispatched to Virginia to interview the governor. Four hours later, his car breaks down on a lonely stretch of rural road, his watch stops, and, afflicted with a strong case of the creeps, he walks up the road to get help at a nearby house.That's when things in ""The Mothman Prophecies"" take a wonderful little detour for the Strange.The man who comes to the door of the first house Gere comes to greets him with a surly ""that's him again"" and a shotgun---and seconds later, Gere finds himself huddled inside Gordon Smallwood's (played to distracted perfection by fine veteran character actor Will Patton) shower, held at gunpoint. When policewoman Connie Parker (played inquisitively by Laura Linney) arrives, the shoe drops hard: Gere has been knocking on Smallwood's door for three nights in a row. Oh, and instead of being in the middle of Virginia, he's in Point Pleasant, West Virginia---400 miles from where he should have been.Director Mark Pellington takes this fine start and just keeps ratcheting up the creepiness from there; not a single second of the film's running time is wasted, and Pellington crafts an atmosphere of impending dread, doom, and general menace. And he's got some good material to draw on: ""Mothman"" is based on the book by John Keel (who wrote the screenplay), which deals with events that actually took place in 1966 in Point Pleasant, West Virginia.So what do you get for your money? You get roughly 100 minutes of sheer, spooky creepiness, with very little gore---and this movie doesn't need it. When I finished ""Mothman Prophecies"" and crawled into bed, for the first time I noticed just how easily the shadows in my bedroom could cloak---well, something big, something Mothlike. Brrr....You get Richard Gere, who in this film, anyway, is no great shakes. He has two expressions: Affably confused, or Confusedly affable. But it's alright, and it works for the most part. Laura Linney is a curious choice; sympathetic, but always appearing as if she's on the edge of revealing something. Patton plays his Gordon with a nice broth of simmering paranoia and kookiness, and steals the show. English actor Alan Bates has a hammy turn as Dr. Alexander Leek, who, asked about the mysterious Mothman, contends ""we're not allowed to know.""But the real star here is the technique used to build up a sense of otherworldly menace: Pellington's strange camera shifts (and kudos also to Fred Murphy, who did the cinematography), half-seen shadowy figures, dizzying aerial shots, cameras that swoop down on their subjects. It all works well, a little too well, in that you're totally keyed up by the film's final credits.In addition to that, the movie boasts two of the creepiest sequences in terror movie history: try not to have goosebumps when Gere has a whispered phone conversation with the mysterious Indrid Cold, or when, confused and trembling, he waits for a promised phone call from his 'wife'.This is nasty, shivery stuff---just make sure your nightlight is working for when the film is over.JSG",4,Look--in the Sky--it's a bird!

Pining for her, Gere eventually loses his mind and meets up with a new love interest, Laura Linney in an attempt to uncover the truth.

It was interesting to see how Gordon, a resident of Point Pleasant who at first holds a shotgun on Klein as he believes him a threatening person who has harrassed him several nights in a row, but who then becomes Klein's ally as Klein searches for the truth and the meaning behind the mothman, introduces Klein to Mr. Cold, who gives Klein another prophecy. But, as Professor Leek, who has had head-on collision experiences with the mothman, tells Klein: Often, people misunderstand the prophecies. Will Klein misunderstand?

I'm an Agnostic, so I'm sort of in the middle when it comes to unexplained phenomenons.  I'm both skeptical and willing to accept that there are things in this universe that will be forever unexplained.  I've actually had a bonafide experience with precognition, so I suppose I'm less skeptical than others.  This story deals with sightings of an Angel of Death type figure that appears and tells certain individuals of catastophic events before they happen.  For what it's worth, I have a slight understanding of the strangeness that one feels when something revealed the day before comes to pass soonafter.  I'll relate my own story for credibility.  I went to bed knowing that I was going to the dog track the following afternoon.  That night I had a dream about a sequence of numbers 1-3-8, 3-1-8, 8-1-3, and so on.  But in my dream the numbers appeared in no certain order.  You can guess what happened at the track the very next day.  It happened in the very first race.  There are three judges at the bottom of the race form who predict which dogs will come in and in what order, and they all picked 1-3-8 in varying sequences.  I thought, &quot;What the hell, I'll bet on a trifecta. There's no way I'm gonna win, anyway.  That would be too bizarre.&quot;  Being uncertain of the sequence, I boxed the trifecta, which means the dogs can come in any order and I win.  They came in, and I won over 50$.  That may not be life or death, but it made me look at the world a little differently afterwards.  Wow, listen to me ramble.  Richard Gere is very good here, and Laura Linney pitches in here and there with another solid performance.  The ending is both eerie and expensive.  I know where half the budget went.  My primary complaint with the film is that the sound is up and down.  I frequently had to turn the volume up as the actors whispered or their voices were drowned in the score.  The score needed to be more in the background when the actors spoke, and the sound man should have been fired.  Some of the dialogue sounds like mumbling, or midway through speaking, background noise washes out key words and I was left wondering what was said.  For hard-bitten skeptics this movie is nothing more than a glorified X-files.  For those who live and breath the supernatural this should be a geniune experience.

699151,A2198FZZMTJ38H,B0000648X0,D. Litton,"[22, 41]","""What Do You See?""In ""The Mothman Prophecies,"" one doesn't see much more than a shadowy figure surrounded by brilliant white and red light, an apparition that serves as the basis for the film's story. Operating under the notion that what we don't see can be equally effective as what we do see, director Mark Pellington helms the story with a sincere sense of menace and a sublime display of visual trickery, but the movie makes the mistake of losing focus from the mystery it claims to lay rest to. Furthermore, it doesn't trust its audience to embrace an ending where loose ends remains, and insists upon supplying us with a less-than-thrilling climax that attempts to mask one problem by providing a resolution to another.It's a classic case of a promising premise that seems to run out of ideas once it comes time for delivery point. Beginning in Washington D.C., we are introduced to the lives of Washington Post reporter John Klein (Richard Gere) and his wife, Mary (Debra Messing), who have just finished buying themselves a new home on Christmas Eve. During the drive home, Mary reacts in shock to something unseen and runs the car off the road; at the hospital, the doctors locate a fatal tumor in her brain, deeming that as the cause of the accident.But Mary knows otherwise, asking her husband, ""You didn't see it?"" Soon after, she dies, leaving behind a notebook with a collection of drawings of a moth-like creature with red eyes and an expressionless face. The film then skips ahead two years, and we find John sullen and emotionally empty. On his way to Richmond in the early morning hours, he soon finds himself in the small town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, a mere hour and a half and a whopping four hundred miles after his initial departure from Washington. This, and a bizarre incident involving a local man accusing him of trespassing numerous times, gives him enough initiative to start questioning reality.Hooking up with local cop Connie Parker (Laura Linney), who speaks of strange occurrences throughout the town, John begins to look for clues as to what his wife saw before the accident, and how he strangely arrived in this town, two things he believes are connected to the events surrounding a mythical creature known to those who see him as ""Mothman."" Soon, he starts getting strange phone calls, reports of his dead wife seen at the police station, and the premonitions of events soon to pass.And this is where the movie starts to collapse on its own agenda. The phone calls, the re-materialized spouse, foretold disasters, all of which work as diversions from the fact that there is no resolution to the mystery surrounding the Mothman. The movie's unwillingness to emphasize that point, much less trust its audience to accept it, sends the third act into a tailspin of ludicrousness, relying on an unneeded climax in hopes of tying together all its loose ends, when it deserves to end on a note of uncertainty. Even the Mothman himself does little for the movie's plot, remaining little more than a botched juxtaposition of good and evil, an identity crisis the movie never clears up.Director Pellington does manage to grab our attention with some very effective camera movements, stylistic dabbles in hallucinatory imagery, and an environment where nothing is without a sense of unease. Many of his shots appear to be the Mothman's point-of-view, a tactic Pellington uses throughout much of the movie, along with intense collages of psychedelic colors and bright lighting. His cast is also first-rate, with credible performances from Gere and Linney, who carry much of the story through expressions of fear and paranoia.But for all of its stylistic approaches and well-meaning performances, ""The Mothman Prophecies"" lacks the courage to tell it like it is. In my research of the events in Point Pleasant prior to the film, I felt a great sense of unease that the movie is curiously lacking in its most essential moments. As a result of the film's need to keep things simple in the end, we learn nothing about the Mothman, nor does the mystery surrounding him ever reach a high note of interest. As a director, Pellington hasn't lost his touch; as a storyteller, he has a lot to learn.",2,Tries to take the easy way out of its messy story.,1012348800,"01 30, 2002",2002,4223,"['What', 'Do', 'See', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'one', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'more', 'shadowy', 'figure', 'surrounded', 'brilliant', 'white', 'red', 'light', 'apparition', 'basis', 'film', 'story', 'Operating', 'notion', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'can', 'be', 'equally', 'effective', 'what', 'do', 'see', 'director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'story', 'sincere', 'sense', 'menace', 'sublime', 'display', 'visual', 'trickery', 'movie', 'mistake', 'losing', 'focus', 'mystery', 'lay', 'rest', 'Furthermore', ""n't"", 'trust', 'audience', 'embrace', 'ending', 'where', 'loose', 'ends', 'supplying', 'less-than-thrilling', 'climax', 'mask', 'one', 'problem', 'providing', 'resolution', 'another.It', 'classic', 'case', 'promising', 'premise', 'run', 'out', 'ideas', 'time', 'delivery', 'point', 'Beginning', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'are', 'introduced', 'lives', 'Washington', 'Post', 'reporter', 'John', 'Klein', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'who', 'have', 'just', 'finished', 'buying', 'new', 'home', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'drive', 'home', 'Mary', 'shock', 'something', 'unseen', 'car', 'road', 'hospital', 'doctors', 'locate', 'fatal', 'tumor', 'brain', 'deeming', 'cause', 'accident.But', 'Mary', 'otherwise', 'asking', 'husband', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'Soon', 'leaving', 'notebook', 'collection', 'drawings', 'moth-like', 'creature', 'red', 'eyes', 'expressionless', 'face', 'film', 'then', 'ahead', 'two', 'years', 'find', 'John', 'sullen', 'emotionally', 'empty', 'way', 'Richmond', 'early', 'morning', 'hours', 'soon', 'small', 'town', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'West', 'Virginia', 'mere', 'hour', 'half', 'whopping', 'four', 'hundred', 'miles', 'initial', 'departure', 'Washington', 'bizarre', 'incident', 'involving', 'local', 'man', 'accusing', 'trespassing', 'numerous', 'times', 'enough', 'initiative', 'start', 'questioning', 'reality.Hooking', 'up', 'local', 'cop', 'Connie', 'Parker', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'who', 'strange', 'occurrences', 'town', 'John', 'look', 'clues', 'what', 'wife', 'saw', 'accident', 'how', 'strangely', 'arrived', 'town', 'two', 'things', 'are', 'connected', 'events', 'surrounding', 'mythical', 'creature', 'known', 'who', 'see', 'Mothman', 'Soon', 'getting', 'strange', 'phone', 'calls', 'reports', 'dead', 'wife', 'seen', 'police', 'station', 'premonitions', 'events', 'soon', 'pass.And', 'where', 'movie', 'collapse', 'own', 'agenda', 'phone', 're-materialized', 'spouse', 'foretold', 'disasters', 'work', 'diversions', 'fact', 'resolution', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Mothman', 'movie', 'unwillingness', 'emphasize', 'point', 'much', 'less', 'trust', 'audience', 'accept', 'third', 'act', 'tailspin', 'ludicrousness', 'relying', 'unneeded', 'climax', 'hopes', 'tying', 'together', 'loose', 'ends', 'when', 'end', 'note', 'uncertainty', 'Even', 'Mothman', 'little', 'movie', 'plot', 'remaining', 'little', 'more', 'botched', 'juxtaposition', 'good', 'evil', 'identity', 'crisis', 'movie', 'never', 'up.Director', 'Pellington', 'manage', 'grab', 'attention', 'very', 'effective', 'camera', 'movements', 'stylistic', 'dabbles', 'hallucinatory', 'imagery', 'environment', 'where', 'nothing', 'sense', 'unease', 'Many', 'shots', 'appear', 'be', 'Mothman', 'point-of-view', 'tactic', 'Pellington', 'much', 'movie', 'intense', 'collages', 'psychedelic', 'colors', 'bright', 'lighting', 'cast', 'also', 'first-rate', 'credible', 'performances', 'Gere', 'Linney', 'who', 'carry', 'much', 'story', 'expressions', 'fear', 'paranoia.But', 'stylistic', 'approaches', 'well-meaning', 'performances', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'courage', 'tell', 'research', 'events', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'film', 'felt', 'great', 'sense', 'unease', 'movie', 'curiously', 'lacking', 'most', 'essential', 'moments', 'result', 'film', 'need', 'keep', 'things', 'simple', 'end', 'learn', 'nothing', 'Mothman', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'ever', 'reach', 'high', 'note', 'interest', 'director', 'Pellington', ""n't"", 'lost', 'touch', 'storyteller', 'lot', 'learn']",N/A

699153,A3VQLTB724O77W,B0000648X0,Dr. Christopher Coleman,"[8, 12]","Like Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame, The Mothman Prophecies is a film to enjoy in and of itself.  Comparison to the book does the movie a disservice, and in no way is this film an historical accounting of the seemingly mysterious events that occurred in Point Pleasant West Virginia in the late sixties.  But as a fictional tale, it is well-told, thought-provoking, original and suspenseful.Consider first the actual events of Point Pleasant; a series of recent articles in the Skeptical Inquirer responding to renewed interest created by the film indicate that the Mothman himself was likely a large barn owl, that the mysterious phone calls were hoaxes by ""UFOlogist"" Gray Barker, and that the bridge collapse was entirely unrelated to those events.  John Keel, author of the book The Mothman Prophecies, described very few of the events of the movie.  There was no Washington Post reporter, no wife with a brain tumor and prophetic visions, no inexplicable 6 hour drive taken in one hour, no mysterious visits by a doppelganger, no visits from the dead--the list goes on and on.  But for all this, we should be grateful; the reality of the case is apparently so mundane that no film purporting to be a truthful depiction of the facts could have been of interest.Where the film succeeds is in its willingness to create a new story, a story that evokes the supernatural in so many ways--through cinematography, visual design, and music in addition to plot.  What actually happens is never entirely clear--while other reviewers find this a fault, it seems to me wonderfully appropriate when dealing with worlds beyond our normal perception.  It is in this respect that the film becomes outstanding, in seeking to ""explain that which is beyond explanation"" several thought provoking ideas emerge.  We are never sure whether the Mothman is devil or angel, whether he comes to give warning or to create disaster, whether he is a creature of power or insignificance.  To help create this uncertainty we never actually see the Mothman, although we are treated to verbal descriptions, drawings by witnesses, and haunting near-glimpses.  Is the Mothman to us like we are to the cockroach, and any attempt to communicate doomed to fail?  Or is the creature of no greater power than we are, but simply living in a different perspective through which it can apprehend our world more clearly than we do ourselves?  Viewers desiring answers to these questions will be disappointed, as will those looking for great special effects or a horrifying monster--I feel certain that these were the cause of the lack of box-office success.  But for those looking for something unusual, suspenseful and stimulating, with a terrific look, good acting, a great script and music, I highly recommend The Mothman Prophecies.",5,"No relation to the ""facts"" and all the better for it!",1042156800,"01 10, 2003",2003,2799,"['Disney', 'Hunchback', 'Notre', 'Dame', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'film', 'enjoy', 'Comparison', 'book', 'movie', 'disservice', 'way', 'film', 'historical', 'accounting', 'seemingly', 'mysterious', 'events', 'occurred', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'West', 'Virginia', 'late', 'sixties', 'fictional', 'tale', 'well-told', 'thought-provoking', 'original', 'suspenseful.Consider', 'first', 'actual', 'events', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'series', 'recent', 'articles', 'Skeptical', 'Inquirer', 'responding', 'renewed', 'interest', 'created', 'film', 'indicate', 'Mothman', 'was', 'likely', 'large', 'barn', 'owl', 'mysterious', 'phone', 'calls', 'were', 'hoaxes', 'UFOlogist', 'Gray', 'Barker', 'bridge', 'collapse', 'was', 'entirely', 'unrelated', 'events', 'John', 'Keel', 'author', 'book', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'described', 'very', 'few', 'events', 'movie', 'was', 'Washington', 'Post', 'reporter', 'wife', 'brain', 'tumor', 'prophetic', 'visions', 'inexplicable', '6', 'hour', 'drive', 'taken', 'one', 'hour', 'mysterious', 'visits', 'doppelganger', 'visits', 'dead', 'list', 'should', 'be', 'grateful', 'reality', 'case', 'apparently', 'so', 'mundane', 'film', 'purporting', 'be', 'truthful', 'depiction', 'facts', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interest.Where', 'film', 'willingness', 'create', 'new', 'story', 'story', 'supernatural', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'design', 'music', 'addition', 'plot', 'What', 'actually', 'never', 'entirely', 'clear', 'other', 'reviewers', 'find', 'fault', 'wonderfully', 'appropriate', 'when', 'dealing', 'worlds', 'normal', 'perception', 'respect', 'film', 'outstanding', 'seeking', 'explain', 'explanation', 'several', 'thought', 'provoking', 'ideas', 'emerge', 'are', 'never', 'sure', 'Mothman', 'devil', 'angel', 'give', 'warning', 'create', 'disaster', 'creature', 'power', 'insignificance', 'help', 'create', 'uncertainty', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'Mothman', 'are', 'treated', 'verbal', 'descriptions', 'drawings', 'witnesses', 'haunting', 'near-glimpses', 'Mothman', 'are', 'cockroach', 'attempt', 'communicate', 'doomed', 'fail', 'creature', 'greater', 'power', 'are', 'simply', 'living', 'different', 'perspective', 'can', 'apprehend', 'world', 'more', 'clearly', 'do', 'Viewers', 'desiring', 'answers', 'questions', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'will', 'looking', 'great', 'special', 'effects', 'horrifying', 'monster', 'feel', 'certain', 'were', 'cause', 'lack', 'box-office', 'success', 'looking', 'something', 'unusual', 'suspenseful', 'stimulating', 'terrific', 'look', 'good', 'acting', 'great', 'script', 'music', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies']",N/A

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[1, 1]","THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES: This 2002 offering is a peculiar favorite of mine, though I really cannot say why other than perhaps the locations. It is one of the worst films in history. The odious Richard Gere aside, this film truly makes no sense whatsoever, yet the wife and I like its chilling, creep-out atmosphere and daring soundtrack. In fact there is a bit in here with Richard Gere and his reflection in a mirror that literally took me years of watching this film to even notice it.Richard Gere plays hotshot reporter John Klein of ""The Washington Post"". After losing his wife (the eternally weird Debra Messing), Klein, on his way to interview the governor of West Virginia, ends up at an odd place, a town called Point Pleasant (a real place). Bizarre events ensue, including horridly weird phone calls, ""Mothman"" sightings, and apparent time-shifts. There is also a pointless, sad death.The cinematography is in fact quite brilliant, for such an overall stupid film. That scene showing Gere standing by a mirror: his reflection seems normal, but it is out of time with his actions. Watch for it! This movie is full of such empty chills, but they are effective. I hate to admit, I had trouble getting to sleep after the very first time I ever saw this movie.The Mothman Propheciesby John Keel, you should know, was a book dealing with sightings of the so-called ""Mothman"", in the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in the mid-1960s. A tragic accident there in the late 1960s, involving the collapse of a bridge and three dozen deaths, followed on the heels of the sightings. This film is vaguely based on that book - and boy, do I mean ""poetic license"" when I say ""vaguely"" ....That book is full of the claims of Keel, a certain popular writer investigating from original source material of another downright fraudulent UFO writer, who was, in fact, at that town during the bridge tragedy. That author was the infamous Gray Barker. Just do a Google on him ... and see what you get.Since then, Barker recanted his story about the Mothman, UFOs and other creepy stories that were the direct inspiration for this film. The UFO author has said he made it all up, and what little was occurring was perpetrated by himself. What an idiot. Yet he informs/inspires and feeds Keel's book.John Keel manages to bring us up to date on the Mothman and other stupidities of this ""haunted world"" of ours. Against my better judgment, I suggest you study his book THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES to learn how all this is supposed to interconnect: men in black, time travel, UFOs, extraterrestrials and the a-hole UFO author who started it all ... it's better than this rotten egg of a movie.Perhaps all of that is why I really like this dumb film.",3,"Gere gets stuck in time, Messing's hair is the same as ever",1284854400,"09 19, 2010",2010,2730,"['MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', '2002', 'offering', 'peculiar', 'favorite', 'mine', 'really', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'why', 'other', 'perhaps', 'locations', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'history', 'odious', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'aside', 'film', 'truly', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'yet', 'wife', 'like', 'chilling', 'creep-out', 'atmosphere', 'daring', 'soundtrack', 'fact', 'bit', 'here', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'reflection', 'mirror', 'literally', 'took', 'years', 'watching', 'film', 'even', 'notice', 'it.Richard', 'Gere', 'hotshot', 'reporter', 'John', 'Klein', 'Washington', 'Post', 'losing', 'wife', 'eternally', 'weird', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'Klein', 'way', 'interview', 'governor', 'West', 'Virginia', 'up', 'odd', 'place', 'town', 'called', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'real', 'place', 'Bizarre', 'events', 'ensue', 'including', 'horridly', 'weird', 'phone', 'calls', 'Mothman', 'sightings', 'apparent', 'time-shifts', 'also', 'pointless', 'sad', 'death.The', 'cinematography', 'fact', 'quite', 'brilliant', 'overall', 'stupid', 'film', 'scene', 'showing', 'Gere', 'standing', 'mirror', 'reflection', 'normal', 'time', 'actions', 'Watch', 'movie', 'full', 'such', 'empty', 'chills', 'are', 'effective', 'hate', 'admit', 'had', 'trouble', 'getting', 'sleep', 'very', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'saw', 'movie.The', 'Mothman', 'Propheciesby', 'John', 'Keel', 'should', 'know', 'was', 'book', 'dealing', 'sightings', 'so-called', 'Mothman', 'town', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'West', 'Virginia', 'mid-1960s', 'tragic', 'accident', 'there', 'late', '1960s', 'involving', 'collapse', 'bridge', 'three', 'dozen', 'deaths', 'followed', 'heels', 'sightings', 'film', 'vaguely', 'based', 'book', 'boy', 'do', 'mean', 'poetic', 'license', 'when', 'say', 'vaguely', '.That', 'book', 'full', 'claims', 'Keel', 'certain', 'popular', 'writer', 'investigating', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'downright', 'fraudulent', 'UFO', 'writer', 'who', 'was', 'fact', 'town', 'bridge', 'tragedy', 'author', 'was', 'infamous', 'Gray', 'Barker', 'Just', 'do', 'Google', 'see', 'what', 'get.Since', 'then', 'Barker', 'recanted', 'story', 'Mothman', 'UFOs', 'other', 'creepy', 'stories', 'were', 'direct', 'inspiration', 'film', 'UFO', 'author', 'said', 'made', 'up', 'what', 'little', 'was', 'occurring', 'was', 'perpetrated', 'What', 'idiot', 'Keel', 'book.John', 'Keel', 'bring', 'up', 'date', 'Mothman', 'other', 'stupidities', 'haunted', 'world', 'ours', 'Against', 'better', 'judgment', 'suggest', 'study', 'book', 'THE', 'MOTHMAN', 'PROPHECIES', 'learn', 'how', 'supposed', 'interconnect', 'men', 'black', 'time', 'travel', 'UFOs', 'extraterrestrials', 'a-hole', 'UFO', 'author', 'who', 'started', 'better', 'rotten', 'egg', 'movie.Perhaps', 'why', 'really', 'dumb', 'film']",N/A

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[1, 1]","The single greatest drawback to THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is the fact that the screenplay was only derived from the events that took place outside Point Pleasant, West Virginia, in 1966.  No film could respectably do John Keel's book justice; arguably, no miniseries could.  However, the book's conclusion, as with the film, cried out for a Hollywoodization, and the screenplay -- while offering only hints at the depth contained in the book of the same name -- succeeds admirably.Richard Gere -- Tibet's favorite non-actor -- plays John Kline (name sound familiar), who after the death of his wife finds himself unexplainably drawn to the town of Point Pleasant ... where, indeed, strange things are afoot.  For, despite his never having been there before, a complete stranger claims to have spoken with Kline two nights consecutively at 2:30 am.  This draws the attention of the local police sergeant (played with subtle grace by the magnificent and beautiful Laura Linney), and the two of them are quickly drawn into the mystery of the Mothman and other supernatural occurences in and around the town.The story lags in a few spots, but the director keeps the interest level up by sprinkling the film with a healthy dose of X Files sensibilities.

The presentation by director Mark Pellington is nothing short of superb.  From a visual standpoint, Pellington heightens both the suspense and paranormal feel with some of the best camerawork I have seen in some time.  Each shot is meticulously planned for maximum effect and the editing is phenomenal.  He mixes tight shots with odd perspective shots, extreme close-ups and vistas, zooming in, zooming out, and giving the viewer a visual workout that never lets up.This is a story that teeters on the line between believable and incredible as an entire town seems to be receiving supernatural warnings of an impending disaster.  Not only is it well told, but well acted.Richard Gere seems determined to break his own mold as an actor, taking chances that keep paying off.  Long considered a lightweight pretty-boy with limited breadth, Gere continues to surprise me with his growth as an actor.  I was impressed by the mature performance he gave in ""Autumn in New York"", shedding his impassive macho image for a more vulnerable character.  This role is an even bigger departure from his standard fare and a better performance.  He gives us a strong and believable performance of a man totally obsessed with understanding the strange events in Point Pleasant and how they might relate to the death of his wife.  If he keeps this up, he is going to start appearing on awards lists.Will Patton also presents us with a phenomenal supporting performance as Gordon, the man fixated on the mothman.  Patton is a fine actor who often plays villainous or offbeat characters.  Here he renders a character that is paranoid to the point of distraction as he is slowly driven insane by the voices he hears.Laura Linney is a throw-in playing a minor role, but she has a couple of compelling scenes with Gere that continue to show her talent.This is a world apart from your standard hack and slash horror flick.

But these strengths ultimately fail to elevate ""The Mothman Prophecies"" into a first-rate thriller.  After an intriguing start it becomes increasingly self-important & ridiculous, and closing credits arrive with a sense of relief.Richard Gere does good work in his first supernatural thriller, as a grieving widower who grows increasingly frantic that he may be losing his sanity.  The bulk of the action is set on the West Virginia-Ohio border in winter, and the bleakness of the landscape mirrors the wintry bleakness that Gere's John Klein feels in his soul.  I could swear that many of the same exterior shots were used in ""Silence of the Lambs""--the production design has a very familiar look.  In order to accept the action of this film as plausible rather than incredulous, however, one has to be able to accept the basic premise--that a giant moth-like creature exists & is able to predict the future.  I had a really hard time doing this, despite the claims that this film was based on actual events that occurred some 40 years ago.  Whether 'Point Pleasant' West Virginia actually exists is easy enough to verify, but unless you are a dedicated believer in the paranormal already, this movie will do nothing to make the existence of such beings more plausible.  Something that is never established satisfactorily:  are the Mothman's intentions toward humans good or ill?  Does he, er, 'it' warn of impeding disaster or cause it?  If its intentions toward man are benign, why does it have such a satanic aspect that causes people to have car accidents or go insane?  Why would a supernatural creature outside of space and time feel the need to communicate through a telephone?""Mothman Prophecies"" was released the same year as Richard Gere's triumphant performance in ""Chicago"".

Skeptics, on the other hand, look for equally preposterous 'real' explanations for stuff that humans perhaps just don't understand.The Mothman Prophecies is full of mystery and subversion. Some parts of it could be explained, but negated by others. It's far-fetched but directed with such sombre timing that the unbelievable slowly creeps up on you. Ghost stories (yes, I am aware that the Mothman is not a ghost but I don't know what else to call him) are, by their very nature, far-fetched and this is probably why most people are eager to dismiss them. But most people fail to remember that their very existence in this Universe is the most far-fetched thing of all. There is an infinity out there than man does not/will never understand. It's arrogance to think that we've got our world figured out already and dismiss anything that doesn't fit in with our day to day lives.So yes, I am inclined to believe in stuff like the Loch Ness Monster, Bigfoot, the Skunk Ape and Little Green Men. Like the movie said, the Mothman has appeared in scriptures and literature of many cultures worldwide for thousands of years. Apparently the book on which the movie is based has more stories of strange happenings and info on Indrid Cold (who is probably the most puzzling, enigmatic character since the Mystery Man from Lost Highway), so it's perhaps a good idea to check it out if you were intrigued by the movie.Director Mark Pellington creates a spooky and haunting Xmas atmosphere and uses the widescreen frame brilliantly. Occasionally he'll throw in a subliminal shot of the Mothman (sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle) or use bizarre imagery to heighten the sense of dread or mystery. It's very well edited and has a lot more class and sophistication than many recent corny PG-13 'horrors' like The Skeleton Key or The Forgotten. In many respects, Mothman is a lot like The Ring in terms of moody atmosphere and cryptic messages. But Mothman, while not a perfect film, is certainly the better of the two.My main problem is that nothing is really wrapped up. I mean I know it cannot be fully explained because no one knows what the Mothman is or who Indrid Cold was but maybe there was more explained or suggested in John A. Keel's book (the man who Richard Gere's character was based on) than the movie featured.Overall, it's a pretty good film and I look forward to Mark Pellington's next movie as I've been impressed with his work on this and Arlington Road so far.The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very intense Dolby 5.1 sound design.",3,"An interesting, if inconclusive, ghost story",1131062400,"11 4, 2005",2005,2652,"['am', 'not', 'skeptic', 'do', 'look', 'most', 'logical', 'explanations', 'paranormal', 'events', 'Skeptics', 'other', 'hand', 'look', 'equally', 'preposterous', ""'real"", 'explanations', 'stuff', 'perhaps', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand.The', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'full', 'mystery', 'subversion', 'parts', 'could', 'be', 'explained', 'negated', 'others', 'far-fetched', 'directed', 'such', 'sombre', 'timing', 'unbelievable', 'slowly', 'up', 'Ghost', 'stories', 'yes', 'am', 'aware', 'Mothman', 'not', 'ghost', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'else', 'call', 'are', 'very', 'nature', 'far-fetched', 'probably', 'why', 'most', 'people', 'are', 'eager', 'dismiss', 'most', 'people', 'fail', 'remember', 'very', 'existence', 'Universe', 'most', 'far-fetched', 'thing', 'infinity', 'there', 'man', 'not/will', 'never', 'understand', 'arrogance', 'think', ""'ve"", 'got', 'world', 'figured', 'out', 'already', 'dismiss', 'anything', ""n't"", 'fit', 'day', 'day', 'lives.So', 'yes', 'am', 'inclined', 'believe', 'stuff', 'Loch', 'Ness', 'Monster', 'Bigfoot', 'Skunk', 'Ape', 'Little', 'Green', 'Men', 'movie', 'said', 'Mothman', 'appeared', 'scriptures', 'literature', 'many', 'cultures', 'worldwide', 'thousands', 'years', 'Apparently', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'more', 'stories', 'strange', 'happenings', 'info', 'Indrid', 'Cold', 'who', 'probably', 'most', 'puzzling', 'enigmatic', 'character', 'Mystery', 'Man', 'Lost', 'Highway', 'perhaps', 'good', 'idea', 'check', 'out', 'were', 'intrigued', 'movie.Director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'spooky', 'haunting', 'Xmas', 'atmosphere', 'widescreen', 'frame', 'brilliantly', 'Occasionally', ""'ll"", 'throw', 'subliminal', 'shot', 'Mothman', 'sometimes', 'obvious', 'sometimes', 'subtle', 'use', 'bizarre', 'imagery', 'heighten', 'sense', 'dread', 'mystery', 'very', 'well', 'edited', 'lot', 'more', 'class', 'sophistication', 'many', 'recent', 'corny', 'PG-13', ""'horrors"", 'Skeleton', 'Key', 'Forgotten', 'many', 'respects', 'Mothman', 'lot', 'Ring', 'terms', 'moody', 'atmosphere', 'cryptic', 'messages', 'Mothman', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'certainly', 'better', 'two.My', 'main', 'problem', 'nothing', 'really', 'wrapped', 'up', 'mean', 'know', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'fully', 'explained', 'one', 'what', 'Mothman', 'who', 'Indrid', 'Cold', 'was', 'maybe', 'was', 'more', 'explained', 'suggested', 'John', 'A', 'Keel', 'book', 'man', 'who', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'character', 'was', 'based', 'movie', 'featured.Overall', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'look', 'forward', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'next', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'been', 'impressed', 'work', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'far.The', 'DVD', '2.35:1', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'very', 'intense', 'Dolby', '5.1', 'sound', 'design']",N/A

Two years later, still grieving, he is driving from Washington to Richmond one night but finds himself mysteriously transported to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. There he finds the town in an uproar over bizarre sitings, the suggestion being that they are encounters with an entity not unlike what led to his wife's death. There he meets a small-town cop, played by Laura Linney. Their interaction is at first quite hokey. She's utterly paranoid that he will stereotype her as a country bumpkin, deeply resenting what she suspects. In so being and doing, she stereotypes him at least every bit as much as she's suspecting him of stereotyping her.

A 'parrallel' time.What does this mean ?  I have no idea.But it raises the question of how can it be possible to see the future unless the future already exists in some form ?  Otherwise it wouldn't be possible to see the future now because something could happen to change it.This is all far beyond human comprehension but anyway the hero of this story is involved with some sort of force or creature who can predict the future.The creature has been interacting with the population of a small town using telephones, visions, dreams, apparitions, etc.. The usual bridges to other dark dimensions.But the moth man creature never comes out and says exactly what's going to happen.  It just gives small clues and glimpses.

699175,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B0000648X0,J from NY,"[5, 7]","""The Mothman Prophecies"" is one of the most underrated contemporary horror films I've ever seen.  I only saw this once and that was awhile ago, but I do remember being amazed that a movie this good could be swept under the rug as it seemingly has been.Richard Gere (yeah, I know) plays a Washington Post reporter named John Klein who loses his wife in a very curious car accident.  After the accident which is purposely filmed so that we don't know how or why it really happened, his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures of a moth.  She keeps asking Klein if he saw this bird of sorts or not, a kind of Dracula-like figure with two eyes that are too bright to make one comfortable.  At first he insists he saw nothing but keeps the pictures, the childlike and chilling images playing a perennial part in the film later on.Will Patton has to be the best actor in this movie.  He plays Gordon Smallwood, outwardly a small town nut and actually a man being driven insane by the bizarre enigma that this innocuous little town unknowingly houses.  When Klein shows up at Gordon's house (and has a rifle shoved in his face), it is not by accident.  Nothing in this movie really is.  The way Pellington shoots the scenes of Gordon losing his mind is unforgettable--it happens in a fizzy, weird video game type way which comes off very vividly.I've never liked Laura Linney too much and have always felt she belongs on TV but she does a decent job as Connie Mills, the local sherrif who basically serves as the dramatic witness for Klein's breakdowns asthe REAL star of the movie--Indrid Cold--keeps calling him. Only in ""The Exorcist"" or ""Black Christmas"", perhaps, have I seen a movie before in which a creepy, otherworldly voice becomes the star.  Even when Klein tries to escape his obsession and tear out the jack from the phone, it keeps ringing and ringing.This is an exercise in derangement and a strange form of hope.  The climax will strike some as impressive and others as senseless.

This is the kind of scary that won't simply just jump out at you during a film but rather, will have you imagining a demon staring you down in the darkness of your bedroom.  The idea that this film is based on true events causes most of the horrifying dilema.A ""Mothman"" is delivering messages to certain people in a small town but it actually seems to be mocking them. Why? Because the creature only bestows so much information, just enough to make them realize a horrible accident was predicted AFTER it already occurs. But that's not the creepy part, my friends, oh no.Richard Gere's character is haunted by his dead wife throughout the film, creating a very subtle, yet very evil feeling during the whole viewing process.  There is also a very terrifying scene where his dead wife comes to...how should I put it...pay her dear hubby a little visit! It gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.Generally, I do not like Richard Gere but I must say he does a very good job in this film.  If it's the eery, spooky kind of horror you seek, this is the perfect place for you to stop and take a peek(wow, that ryhmed).

699177,ARMH3GNZ83JGQ,B0000648X0,John Margaritis,"[6, 10]","I really enjoyed this movie, and to me it was much more intriguing than the book.  I read John Keel's book after seing the trailer for the movie and doing some research on the Internet; I found it extremely unbelievable and not very well-written.  Keel gives his theories and tries to explain how and why everything happened to the reader, which is opposite of what the movie did--the film leaves you with many unanswered questions, which is fine with me because I like unsolved mysteries that no one can explain.  What really happened in Point Pleasant, West Virginia?  Nobody really can answer that question with certainty.On to the movie, the film starts with John Klein(Richard Gere) and his wife, Mary(Debra Messing), looking at a house they're interested in buying.  The two of them seem to be newly married and very happily in love.  On the way home from the house, Mary sees something.  She looks closer, not sure what it is--and then whatever it is hits the car, which sends it spinning out of control, and Mary ends up being badly injured.  While in the hospital, Mary starts drawing pictures of a winged creature with two blazing red eyes--the Mothman.  She asks her husband: &quot;You didn't see it, did you?&quot;.  I won't go into anymore details about what happens after, because it will reveal too much.  What I can tell you is that strange things start to happen to John Klein, and they all seemed to be related to this winged creature and a place called Point Pleasant.  The more he learns about what's happening there, the more he is drawn into the mystery.Mothman Prophecies has a very eerie feel to it.  There are not many scenes that will have you jumping from your seat--it's more a creepy feeling of dread which heightens the tension with each passing moment.  There are some great performances by Laura Linney, Will Patton and Debra Messing, but Richard Gere really steals the show.  He gives a terrific performance as John Klein, a man that is close to losing his mind trying to solve the mystery of Point Pleasant.  I really related to what his character was going through.  Great job of directing by Mark Pellington--he keeps the pace moving just fast enough to keep it interesting.

699178,A126JVOAOOR42V,B0000648X0,John McConnell,"[9, 11]","If you enjoy suspense centered around the paranormal, this film is likely one you'll enjoy. First, three ideas helpful for considering this film's premise:1. Joseph Campbell (Power of Myth, vol 6) speaks of forces ""too powerful for the forms of time and space"" that therefore ""come through as monsters"". Campbell remarks elsewhere - quoting Buddhist scripture - that, ""When the Angel of Death approaches you it is terror; when it reaches you - it is bliss"".2. Jung speaks of a ""collective unconscious"" connecting we all share, contribute to, and paticipate in on some primal level, and how ""repressed"" contents of the psyche may come to be perceived externally and ""demonically"" when they inevitably ""spill out"".3. Electricity, electromagnetism - call it what you will - is a ""force"" physicists understand to have a certain ""infinity"" about it: electromagnetic waves ""go on forever"".The film is scintillating, tightly edited, well scripted, well acted, enjoyable, and filled with aesthetically subtle and unique visual effects. First, the visuals, then the story (no plot spoiler), then a brief assessment.1. THE VISUALSThe film is heavily visual, opening surreally with what appear to be foreshortened - therefore ""V-shaped"" - hall lights folding back upon themselves, juxtaposed with an aerial view (the first of many) of the city where Gere works, followed by a view of a commercial Christmas angel in a department store. As the story progresses, we suddenly are introduced to a chilling image of a V-shaped ""moth"" clearly resonant of the images just mentioned. From here on the film starts pouring it on, continuously expanding the range of emotional valences associated with this ubiquitous V shape until almost everything you see in this film starts looking like a moth. This relentless technique of imposing a strongly centered but outbranching nonverbal imagery - the wings of a moth - upon the verbal action of the film, coupled with camera angles that crop up and creep in from all sides, causes the film to take on a ""decentered three dimensionality"". A similar technique is employed with sounds - particularly creakings and respiration. Not quite ""imagery"" in the standard sense, what you start to experience is a psychological assault from all sides as the cascading ""unfoldings"" of the V shape become connected with other shapes such as arches and circles and spheres. By the film's climax - again - just about every shape or sound has become immediately evocative of the seemingly ubiquitous and eldritch Mothman.2. THE STORYA distinct advantage of a contemporary setting is a sense of immediacy vital to ""pull you in"". Were it otherwise, the film would have a dud-docudrama feeling about it. Here, however, everything feels familiar. Another strength of the film lies in its refusal to draw conclusions for the viewer about what is happening. No one in the story knows; neither do you. The film *suggests*. It is a specious critique that the film leaves unanswered questions because much fiction does: Shakespeare's plays - the tragedies, particularly - being a prime example. The story suggests the Mothman phenomenon might be a manifestation of the unconscious - the ""Deep Deep Unconscious"" - as it appears in several different persona (and purportedly throughout the world). Events begin taking on a surreal character as even time and space are warped about the happenings of Pleasant Point.As the moth-like figure appeared to Gere's wife far away from Pleasant Point, this argues circumstantially against the ET hypothesis. But is the Mothman - whatever it is - benign? She saw the figure before her death, but did it *cause* her death? Apparently not, we are reassured by the neuropathologist because her MRI scan revealed a rare glioblastoma clearly [?] predating the traumatic epiphany of Mothman. Perhaps the Mothman suggests nothing so much as an Angel of Death, which figure also is ubiquitous throughout world literature and culture? The parapsychologist Dr Leek remarks that the Mothman appears differently to different people, but invariably foreshadowing catastrophe. It is suggestive, then, is it not, that to the man who had lost everything, Gordon, the Mothman was perceived as human and benign, but to Gere's wife - who had everything to live for - the Mothman appeared horrific, much as death would appear to us all under similar circumstances?However, the burns and bleeding several people suffered, the telephonic recording of the entity's inhumanly high-frequency voice, the light and pyrotechnics associated with its appearance - these suggest an affinity of the creature with electricity. (There are frequent intentional camera effects which regenerate the V imagery around electrical lights and fixtures.) Lastly, the entity's self-professed name (""kINDRED oLD"") reinforces Dr Leek's notion of such beings having always existed here on Earth. Is the Mothman our ""oppressed"" psyche, or ""oLD"" creatures ""oppressed"" by our mere presence and inevitable sufferings, or are we merely ""oppressed"" by them?3. PARTING THOUGHTA great deal of salutary aesthetic discipline was exercised by director Mark Pellington in not allowing this film to descend to the level of ""shlock shock"". This is not an ideal film, however, for watching with an impressionable child. If your child is going to see this film eventually, first watch it together with long, frequent breaks. Overall, this movie requires no blinking and sufficient time to watch before the sun goes down. It's mildly electrifying - even haunting, and stays with you. (Oddly enough, my stereo receiver started acting up as soon as the videotape ended.)",4,"""The Moth is Symbolic of the Oppressed Human Soul""",1025827200,"07 5, 2002",2002,5639,"['enjoy', 'suspense',

And when it occasionally employed such tactics, it did so stylishly and with some originality.  I also liked how the movie skillfully used unanswered questions to bring about an increased sense of menace and mystery, rather than letting such questions simply annoy and confuse the viewer.  However, if you're one for neat packages, this film may not be for you.  Was the Mothman benevolent?  Malevolent?  A little of both?  What were its true motives?  And did Richard Gere's dead wife make some actual appearances, or was that the Mothman just toying with Gere's character? Or was it perhaps Gere's character employing some wishful thinking and making himself believe his wife was trying to contact him... after all, with the Mothman appearing to everyone and all this other weird stuff going on, why COULDN'T his dead wife be visiting him, too?  Anyway, though there's ultimately enough closure to make for a satisfying movie, be warned that most of this stuff is left unanswered.

699180,A2NBOL825B93OM,B0000648X0,J R Zullo,"[0, 2]","I like a director who knows what to do with his images, and Mark Pellington surely fits in this category. Also, as previously stated in ""Arlington Road"", Pellington knows how to build tension from sparse and even simple facts. ""The mothman prophecies"" has an interesting premise, but the viewer has to be patient not to turn the dvd-player off after one hour of the movie.Two years after his wife's death, following a bizarre car accident and a rare brain tumor, John Klein (Richar Gere) is inexplicably drawn to little Point Pleasant, a small town where people are seeing strange things, things that resemble very much the death-angel-like drawings his wife made during her final stay at the hospital. As a reporter and as an interested part in the mistery, John Klein will do everything to try and discover what's really going on in Point Pleasant.The first hour of the movie is really good. It reads like something out of the X-files. Also, it's scarier because it's supposedly based on true facts. Mark Pellington was right on spot when he established, from the very beginning, that ""The mothman prophecies"" was really made on supernatural foundations. If the viewers were left looking for a rational explanation for the facts displayed on the movie, it would be extremely wrong and deceiving. The images, complemented by a dark and moving sound score, are effective in making the viewer in the edge of his seat. And the usual good performances by Will Patton and excellent Laura Linney give credibility to the story. After the first hour and the establishment of the ""mothman"" entity, the movie looses its pace. It kind of drags on until Richard Gere's character finally discovers the truth and the movie moves on to the final scene, which is in fact very well produced and thrilling.""The mothman prophecies"" is a very effective thriller, based on good visuals and an interesting story, and should deserve five stars.

699185,A3BV9E9XSA4Z73,B0000648X0,Karl,"[1, 2]","As Shakespeare might have said - this film is full of sound and fury, but ultimately signifies nothing.In order to understand this film to best effect - like why there are two Christmas trees in the hospital, and why we keep seeing rows and loops of multicoloured lights - you really need to watch the 'Special Features' before you watch the main feature. Apart from over-using the contents of the basic trailer, these ""extras"" are genuinely interesting, useful and relevant.The basic problem with the whole project, as far as I could tell, was that any attempt to raise the film to a metaphysical level (listen to the comments by Richard Gere (star), Will Patton (lead support) and Mark Pellington (director) in the Interviews feature) was effectively kyboshed by the need to produce what somebody thought would be a marketable product.Despite the frequent claims that the story is ""based on truth"" the fact is that it is LOOSELY related to certain highly subjective reports of ""the truth"" as set out in John Keel's book ""The Mothman Prophecies"".I mention this because whilst the film uses the idea that the Mothman, or Mothmen, gave detailed warnings - ""99 will die"", ""disaster on the River Ohio"", etc., the message from John Keel is that the prophetic element is IMPLICIT rather than EXPLICIT. That is to say, Keel seems (in the interviews on this disc) to be saying that SIGHTINGS of mothmen imply looming disaster wherever they are seen, but he mentions NO examples of direct communication with human beings, and certainly NO specific prophecies.As to the film itself, it is unquestionably technically ""clever"", but it is a clever presentation of pretty hackneyed material.Gere, as bland as ever, is distraught over the death of his wife in a car accident two years earlier (the crash provides the prologue to the main action).After somehow travelling 400 miles in an hour or so - at the end of which he loses all electrical functions in car and mobile phone (this typical UFO-associated phenomena is never fully explored) - he meets up with Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), who is apparently being pestered by a Mothman, and Police Officer Connie Mills (Laura Lynney), with whom Gere then proceeds to deliver a ""poor man's"" version of ""The X-Files""'s Mulder and Scully for the rest of the film.Gere has his own interpretation of the film in general, and his part in particular, which he describes in the interview section of the disc and which certainly helps to explain the way he plays his part.Unfortunately this interpretation is never allowed full rein, and the film comes down to a fairly straight drive to the final Silver Bridge collapse and consequent loss of life which are depicted the last 10 minutes of the film and which are the only details, as far as I could tell, that were genuinely based on ""true events"".In the final analysis this is JUST passable as comic book level entertainment - but unless you're the sort of person who thinks that the Bermuda Triangle stories are pure fact, DON'T expect to get anything meaningful out of it.

699186,A1VZLLDNLURGJB,B0000648X0,Keith Mirenberg,"[6, 8]","THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES was an outstanding five star horror film starring Richard Gere, Laura Linney, and Debra Messing. This film was directed by Mark Pellington, edited by Brian Berdan and filmed under the direction of Fred Murphy. I mention these names because of the wonderful visual effects, great camera work and especially fine film editing which assisted the cast to relate the story. Last, but not least, the musical score is as original as it is strange and beautiful.This film had outstanding acting, an absolutely great script and a well thought out plot. It was meticulously filmed, staged and edited which did not overwhelm the performance. Although it was not critically acclaimed, it was well received by fans and is one of the most visually expressive films I have ever watched.While scarcely a documentary it is based on the collapse of the Point Pleasant Bridge. The plot involves a Washington Post reporter (Richard Gere playing John Klein) who is deeply in love with his new bride, her tragic and mystifying death and his exposure to dark forces that result when he is driven to leave town in despair.One night while in a fit of depression he is drawn to Point Pleasant Virginia where several odd sightings of strange lights in the sky, and an inexplicable butterfly or moth like shape (Mothman) have been reported by a small but steadily growing number of people. More troubling is the fact that these folks are good townspeople, solid citizens and even local police, making it difficult to brush off reports as imagined. When this entity begins to make verbal communication it starts by saying ""Be not afraid,"" and then goes on to make tragic predictions. Its last words are often ""I will see you in time"".After being first drawn into this situation, Richards Gere's car gives out in the middle of a country road due to an electrical problem, conjuring up thoughts of X-Files UFO sightings, angelic or possibly demonic visitations. Once settled at a local motel he is bothered by several strange nocturnal phone calls, wrong numbers, un-requested wake up calls and ultimately hears via phone the voice of the mysterious Indrid Cold.The reporter contacts a writer and expert on the subject who he learns was once a tenured professor of physics from Cornell. Alexander Leek describes his encounters with the Mothman starting with his receiving predicted disasters, trying to communicate warnings with the authorities and people at risk, being investigated, almost arrested, divorced, and estranged from his family. He last pleads with John Klein to back away from the situation. Mr. Leek made one last appeal saying ""Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you? The real issue becomes which is more important, having proof or being alive?""When asked on the phone by John Klein what the creature looks like it replies ""It depends on who is looking"". After the call the reporter brings a recording of the strange voice to a voice print analyst who determines that it was not produced by a human larynx as it is carried by too narrow a portion of the audio spectrum close to around 2000 Hz. The specialist identifies the voice as ""artificial"" (i.e., computer generated?).After Indrid Cold convinces the reporter of his otherworldly nature he goes on to mysteriously predict the collapse of the Point Pleasant Bridge (something John Klein must put together for himself). Just when I was getting ready for the film to disappoint, the destruction of the bridge is convincingly presented in parallel with the telling of the remainder of the very mysterious plot.The bridge collapse was I believe the result of skillful model and CGI work, and was exceptionally credible looking. Real world slow motion effects which amazed me included: reflected waves traveling along support cables when they were under tension and when relaxed, the flexing, yielding and rupture of ductile bridge structure, the realistic powdering and fragmenting of brittle materials (probably model work), falling massive segments of the bridge and submerged bridge structures and vehicles. In addition to being very realistic it was very artistically done, including the final scenes of vehicles under bridge debris on the river bottom with headlights still on, producing a strange otherworldly visual effect of blue light beams in the water.In short, after the movie had delivered on every level it went on to provide during the last five minutes some of the most thrilling and realistic special effects I have ever watched. Many of the screen effects provide fleeting glimpses of the mothman, snatches of a strange face in a door mirror, or the fine detail of the morphing shape of a moth reflected in the pupil of a human eye. These hand crafted images hold up during slow scan and were often too subtle to be noticed on the first viewing.If we can believe the reports, Mothman sightings have been taking place all over the world in areas of great tragedy and loss of life, including Chernobyl.  While none of these sightings have been accompanied by verbal communication, the reports alone were sufficient for many of us to suspend disbelief and allow the story to take us along with it. This great movie is a must see for all fans of the paranormal who appreciate a fine film. I place this movie on a par with the production of JACOB'S LADDER and THE (original) HAUNTING.",5,THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES - An unusually fine horror film,1212796800,"06 7, 2008",2008,5385,"['MOTHMAN',

There have been many 'Man' creatures that have been reported. Everything from Skunk Man to Lizard Man, but I believe the Mothman is most interesting. The fact that many people have seen this thing and reported it, all having similar descriptions is just creepy. Naturally, I was interested in this movie because of this. Ultimately, I thought it portrayed the Mothman phenomenon pretty poorly. The first thing that I find bad about this film is its lack of a convincing story. The fact that the box says Based On True Events really means nothing. The film &quot;Titanic&quot; was based on true events as well. They base a fictitious plot around a true event. &quot;Based&quot; is your key word. I believe that's what they did here. The Mothman accounts in West Virginia were real, but the story happening around that event was put in. I could be wrong, but it seems to me that the film relied on those four words to push its story. That was the major problem I found in the film. Another problem I found was there really wasn't enough Mothman in the film. All the Mothman was was an electronic voice on a phone which got really repetitive after the fifth time he called. They should've focused more on encounters with the Mothman. In the last twenty minutes of the film I nearly forgot that there was a Mothman involved. Other than that, there were some good parts to the film, mainly dealing with the predictions of the Mothman coming true. And Richard Gere's departure from grandmotherly romantic comedy films for a second in this film was nice.

699194,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000648X0,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[60, 68]","Certainly ""The Mothman Prophecies"" reminds me more of ""The Blair Witch Project"" than any other film I have seen.  Both films become almost oppressive in their use of cinematic cues that something is about to happen (a feeling propelled mainly by the ominipresent eerie music in ""Mothman"") and you are not quite sure what the hell happens in either movie.  Director Mark Pellington definitely does a nice job of putting the audience into the perspective of the protagonist, John Klein (Richard Gere) as he tries to unravel this mystery.The hook for this film is a car accident in which a sudden mothlike image startles Klein's wife, Mary (Debra Messing).  The resulting accident is not fatal, but leads to the discovery of a brain tumor that proves to be.  Klein is haunted by not only Mary's death, but her dying wish that he be happy and her frantic question, ""Didn't you see it?""  After her death he discovers she has drawn pages of disturbing mothlike images.We then jump ahead two years to the line.  Klein, a political reporter for the Washington Post (and therefore a cynical skeptic by occupation if not temperment) leaves at 1 a.m. for Richmond.  But at 2:30 he finds his car breaking down near a house in Point Pleasant, West Virginia--400 miles away--with no memory of how he got there.  Curiouser and curiouser, when he knock on the door of Gordon Smallwood (Will Patton), he is threatened with a shotgun and told this is the third night in a row he has come knocking on the door.The sinker is Connie Mills (Laura Linney), the local cop who saves Klein from Gordon and who admits that strange things have been happening in this neck of the woods for quite some time, usually having something to do with disturbing mothlike images.  You might think that there is an inevitable romance to be had here between Klein and Connie, but whatever attraction exists between the two is nothing in the face of the growing mystery.One of the reasons ""The Mothman Prophecies"" creates such a sense of disquiet in the audience is that we are not sure exactly how to read the film.  Should we be thinking straightforward gothic horror or something more along the lines of science fiction?  Eventually I came to the conclusion that part of the dynamic of this film was that we were not supposed to figure it out; indeed, you cannot.  I watched the film a second time specifically to try and make pieces fit (no, did not read the book, but am interested in doing so given the comments of other reviewers), and I could not do it.  Nor could I really lay out the powers of the Mothman in a way that would be particularly helpful.  Indeed, I became so wary in this film that I was unwilling to believe phone calls were from the characters we heard unless we actually saw the person talking to Klein on the other end of the connection.Gere's character is trying to proceed in good old journalistic fashion, but is constantly left befuddled by the people he talks to and the events he witnesses.  Linney provides the stability in the film, not just to Gere's character but to the entire situation.  The emotional heart of the film is Patton, as the local guy caught up in events beyond his wildest imagaintion, although Lucinda Jenney, playing his wife Denise, provides wonderful support (her scene in the hall of the hospital where she offers her husband total support is the small acting gem in the film).""The Mothman Prophecies"" is not a conventional horror film, and I suspect that those who have the most trouble with it will be those least satisfied by unconventional films.  Ultimately, this is a film (and a story) where the questions are more important that the answers.  The fact that those answers are virtually nonexistent only underscores the point that we are not supposed to know what is going on.  Actually, there is something to be said for a film that reduces both its main characters and audience alike to asking themselves ""What just happened?"" and ""What does it mean?""",4,An unconventional and disquieting modern horror film,1027382400,"07 23, 2002",2002,3976,"['Certainly', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'more', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'other', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'become', 'almost', 'oppressive', 'use', 'cinematic', 'cues', 'something', 'happen', 'feeling', 'propelled', 'mainly', 'ominipresent', 'eerie', 'music', 'Mothman', 'are', 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'hell', 'movie', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Pellington', 'definitely', 'nice', 'job', 'putting', 'audience', 'perspective', 'protagonist', 'John', 'Klein', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'unravel', 'mystery.The', 'hook', 'film', 'car', 'accident', 'sudden', 'mothlike', 'image', 'Klein', 'wife', 'Mary', 'Debra', 'Messing', 'resulting', 'accident', 'not', 'fatal', 'discovery', 'brain', 'tumor', 'be', 'Klein', 'haunted', 'not', 'only', 'Mary', 'death', 'dying', 'wish', 'be', 'happy', 'frantic', 'question', 'Did', ""n't"", 'see', 'death', 'drawn', 'pages', 'disturbing', 'mothlike', 'images.We', 'then', 'ahead', 'two', 'years', 'line', 'Klein', 'political', 'reporter', 'Washington', 'Post', 'therefore', 'cynical', 'skeptic', 'occupation', 'not', 'temperment', '1', 'a.m.', 'Richmond', '2:30', 'car', 'breaking', 'down', 'house', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'West', 'Virginia', '400', 'miles', 'away', 'memory', 'how', 'got', 'there', 'Curiouser', 'curiouser', 'when', 'knock', 'door', 'Gordon', 'Smallwood', 'Will', 'Patton', 'threatened', 'shotgun', 'told', 'third', 'night', 'row', 'come', 'knocking', 'door.The', 'sinker', 'Connie', 'Mills', 'Laura', 'Linney', 'local', 'cop', 'who', 'Klein', 'Gordon', 'who', 'strange', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'happening', 'neck', 'woods', 'quite', 'time', 'usually', 'having', 'something', 'do', 'disturbing', 'mothlike', 'images', 'might', 'think', 'inevitable', 'romance', 'be', 'had', 'here', 'Klein', 'Connie', 'attraction', 'two', 'nothing', 'face', 'growing', 'mystery.One', 'reasons', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'creates', 'sense', 'disquiet', 'audience', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'how', 'read', 'film', 'Should', 'be', 'thinking', 'straightforward', 'gothic', 'horror', 'something', 'more', 'lines', 'science', 'fiction', 'Eventually', 'came', 'conclusion', 'part', 'dynamic', 'film', 'was', 'were', 'not', 'supposed', 'figure', 'out', 'indeed', 'can', 'not', 'watched', 'film', 'second', 'time', 'specifically', 'try', 'make', 'pieces', 'fit', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'am', 'interested', 'doing', 'so', 'given', 'comments', 'other', 'reviewers', 'could', 'not', 'do', 'could', 'really', 'lay', 'out', 'powers', 'Mothman', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'particularly', 'helpful', 'Indeed', 'became', 'so', 'wary', 'film', 'was', 'unwilling', 'believe', 'phone', 'calls', 'were', 'characters', 'heard', 'actually', 'saw', 'person', 'talking', 'Klein', 'other', 'end', 'connection.Gere', 'character', 'trying', 'proceed', 'good', 'old', 'journalistic', 'fashion', 'constantly', 'left', 'befuddled', 'people', 'events', 'Linney', 'stability', 'film', 'not', 'just', 'Gere', 'character', 'entire', 'situation', 'emotional', 'heart', 'film', 'Patton', 'local', 'guy', 'caught', 'up', 'events', 'wildest', 'imagaintion', 'Lucinda', 'Jenney', 'playing', 'wife', 'Denise', 'wonderful', 'support', 'scene', 'hall', 'hospital', 'where', 'husband', 'total', 'support', 'small', 'acting', 'gem', 'film', 'Mothman', 'Prophecies', 'not', 'conventional', 'horror', 'film', 'suspect', 'who', 'have', 'most', 'trouble', 'will', 'be', 'least', 'satisfied', 'unconventional', 'films', 'Ultimately', 'film', 'story', 'where', 'questions', 'are', 'more', 'important', 'answers', 'fact', 'answers', 'are', 'virtually', 'nonexistent', 'only', 'point', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'Actually', 'something', 'be', 'said', 'film', 'main', 'characters', 'audience', 'alike', 'asking', 'What', 'just', 'happened', 'What', 'mean']",N/A

After the film, it's one where you start asking questions.  Why was there a moth in the new house that Gere and Debra Messing bought?  Was that the mothman?  Was their house haunted?  If they hadn't bought that house, would they not have been affected?  Was Mary's (Messing) tumor caused by mothman?  If mothman comes to predict major dissasters, why'd he bother with this one woman?  And that's the first ten minutes.  So the plot itself creates some major questions.  Will Patton who I've enjoyed on the tv series &quot;The Agency&quot; does a nice job as the half-crazy Gordon who's being haunted by the Mothman.  His wife played by Lucinda Jenney also has a nice supporting role filled with emotion.  Laura Linney who previously starred in &quot;Primal Fear&quot; with Gere, does a superb job of adding a bit of sanity and humanity to the role of small town cop.  Alan Bates is convincing as the paranormal author Alexander Leek.  However, when we get to the climax of the bridge collapse, the film unfolds almost as a series of tableaux still shots rather than an unfolding of action.  This tends to place the viewer outside the event rather than becoming involved in it.  While the film's pacing is not the best, I found it engaging as a mysterious paranormal thriller.

699196,AFOK05KDCHSHL,B0000648X0,Libretio,"[10, 10]","THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES(USA - 2001)Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSFollowing the loss of his wife in a fatal traffic accident, a successful journalist (Richard Gere) is strangely drawn to the small town of Point Pleasant in West Virginia where sightings of a weird moth-like creature appear to foretell a devastating tragedy...Mark Pellington's portentous drama claims to be based on actual events surrounding a disaster on the Ohio River in 1967. Stylish to a fault, the film develops a keen sense of foreboding as Gere's world is transformed by his wife's mysterious death, leading to a series of genuinely creepy episodes as soon as he arrives in Point Pleasant (eg. Gere's 'first' encounter with Will Patton, his 'telephone conversation' with the Mothman, etc.). Apparently, neither Gere nor director Pellington were interested in making a conventional 'monster movie', opting instead for a series of bizarre plot twists and sudden shocks, linked to various glimpses of the title creature in a number of clever disguises.Scripted by Richard Hatem (UNDER SIEGE 2) and based on John A. Keel's non-fiction book (an overview of the entire Mothman phenomenon), the film exhausts its sleight-of-hand trickery around the halfway mark and subsequently loses some of its forward momentum, despite a welcome cameo appearance by acting heavyweight Alan Bates as a grizzled professor whose personal encounters with the eponymous Mothman have reduced him to a shadow of his former self. Elsewhere, the movie is lifted by an explosive climax, but this remarkable sequence seems a little hollow and inconclusive, despite the elaborate pyrotechnics, perhaps because the characters have been kept at arms-length throughout the narrative, playing second fiddle to the unfolding mystery.For all its drawbacks, however, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES - clearly inspired by the recent popular success of like-minded chillers THE BALIR WITCH PROJECT (1999) and THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) - is mature, intelligent, and often deeply unsettling, and both Laura Linney (TALES OF THE CITY) and Debra Messing (""Will & Grace"") are excellent in crucial supporting roles.

When a friend of mine mentioned that the film's director (Mark Pellington) was also the director of Pearl Jam's ""Jeremy"" videoclip, my curiosity got even bigger.I was not disappointed.The film gets most of the pieces of the puzzle right.The screenplay, which is loosely based on real events, has all the right twists and achieves in keeping the viewer restless on his/her seat. Ok, at some points it gets pretty predictable, but the ending's climax is without any doubt satisfying.The music really helps in enhancing the movie's atmosphere, giving us a few good scares, too.As for the direction, Pellington borrows some videoclip tricks (grainy images, perspective shots, strange angles) but uses them masterfully, keeping the tension high to the last scene.I intentionally left the acting last. Many people may have objections over the use of Richard Gere for the leading part. I found him more than adequate. As for the supporting cast, I liked Alan Bates, who plays a former professor having some valuable information to share.

Though set in the present, it is loosely based on events alleged to have occurred in a small West Virginia town in the 1960s.John and Mary [Richard Gere and Debra Messing] are a happily married couple living in Washington DC. One night they are in an auto accident, and Mary is badly injured. She asks John if he saw `it' before the wreck. He doesn't know what she is talking about. She begins to draw pictures of a moth-like creature, but before he can figure anything out, she dies. A few months later, John has to drive down to Richmond, VA. Somehow he winds up hundreds of miles off course in West Virginia. He has no way of accounting for this. Soon he is running into people who have seen the same creature his wife saw. John decides to investigate and is assisted by the local sheriff [Laura Linney]. As he searches for the mothman, he increasingly gets the feeling that something disastrous is about to happen.Photographically, the movie is excellent. The actors give their best shots to their rather limited characters. The problems are in the screenplay. The creature is never clearly seen, and its purpose is only vaguely defined. The story tries to get around these weaknesses by switching directions at the end. I won't say how because it would spoil the plot. While the ending is spectacular and exciting, it's almost as if it belongs in a different movie.

I was in the midst of a switch from VCR tapes to DVD player and The Mothman Prophecies was an unfortunate victim of the transition, a tape with no player for it.  I promptly forgot about it, but Netflix didn't.In a somewhat eerie parallel, I recently started prepping the Dark*Matter adventure ""The Killing Jar"" for my D20 Modern conspiracy game.  The Killing Jar has quite a bit of information about the Mothman and provided a helpful backdrop to The Mothman Prophecies.What's interesting is that this movie actually makes a lot more sense than the book of the same name by John A. Keel.  Keel covers a wide range of paranormal phenomena, from UFOs to Men in Black, from ghosts to the bizarre Mothman. The Mothman itself even has a name, Indrid Cold, and isn't afraid to make phone calls late at night.And that's what's so unsettling about The Mothman Prophecies. The film flagrantly violates movie tropes by having its apparition not only adopt a name but make dire prophecies at length over the phone.John Klein (Richard Gere) is the perfect foil for an exploration of the beyond, a haunted man who cannot move on after the death of his wife. Klein has an entire conversation with Cold, testing its knowledge of the present and the future.  He even tapes the phone call.But Cold's paranormal abilities extend well beyond phone calls. It can adopt other peoples' voices, both dead and alive. Ghosts show up in the flesh. It can leave messages for you at the front desk. And you can tape it all you want - vocal analysis will show it's an actual voice.  Your voice.  Only you didn't make the call.If you know anything about the original Mothman Prophecies, you know how all this ends.  But that's beside the point. The Mothman Prophecies is largely about grief and recovery.  But it's also about the burden of the future, knowing that there is an inevitable conclusion to all things that we simply cannot control.  Death brings that knowledge into terrible perspective.Unfortunately, the movie drags.  And drags.  The eerie sounds are a bit overplayed; in some cases, silence would have been more effective than the relentless sound effects.  The aural assault may have been more effective in the theater, but on television it's just annoying.That doesn't detract from Mothman's overall sense of dread.

699206,A21P8800ZGRGIP,B0000648X0,Miketheratguy,"[4, 7]","Mothman supposedly existed and was a creature that scared several people in the 60's. A book was written about the moral and supernatural angles of these sightings. This film is based on that book, not so much the creature itself, and as a result this is not an accurate horror/monster movie but instead a decent but disappointing supernatural thriller.Having thoroughly read the history of the alleged titular creature, Mothman, I was at first quite disappointed in this film. The real case dealt with people who were supposedly chased by a tall, bird-like man creature with glowing red eyes and incredible speed. The creature did strange things like flying without flapping its wings, and it sounded like a woman screaming. The case, never officially solved, allegedly involved UFOs, although barely a legitimate link to them was made.Instead of being based on these things, the film is more directly based on a book of the same name, which itself was more of a hypothetical study of what Mothman may mean and represent. A focal point in the film is how the sighting of the monster allegedly preceded disasters. In actuality, the creature was only scantily reported to have been seen around the Ohio river bridge when it collapsed in the late 60s. The film showed this collapse and is its finest scene. But then it adds extra mysterious details to the event, such as Mothman's ability to make people dream such an event before it happened, etc. This is an example of the film being based on the more glamorous ideas in the book instead of focusing on the facts of the case itself, which were far more interesting and would have made for a more frightening movie.The movie is, however, well done. It takes itself seriously, is well acted, and features very good mood music and ambience. It sets the mood, leading up to some great scenes such as one in which the main character talks with the alleged creature on the phone. It's creepy stuff, but scenes like that are all too rare in this film. It had a lot of promise and was well done, but I had my hopes up for more of a thriller along the lines of the Sixth Sense, which was well written and acted but still had its fair share of visual chills. As it stands, the Mothman Prophecies is good, and I give it credit for getting a lot of facts and references to the actual case correct. But I was hoping for something much more based on the incidents as they were reported, as opposed to an opinionated book that merely theorized what may have really happened.

I really didnt know much about what this was about with the trailer but it didnt take long to figure out. Its basically about paranormal activity. Its actually very frightening and very unpredictable whcih I think can make or break a movie. I never knew what was going to come next and I really enjoy that kind of movies.

Particularly the events occurring in Point Pleasant. If you do not know the legend, you may be lost while viewing this film. Since I cannot possibly explain the entire ""legend"" in this review. I recommend doing an internet search for ""The Mothman""... or... ""Silver Bridge Disaster"".A quick summary as follows. In 1966, in Point Pleasant, West Virginia,  a bridge spanning the Ohio River collapsed. Many people died when their cars plummeted into the Ohio River or the Ohio River banks. This is documented fact. The name of the bridge was Silver Bridge.The events that happened PRIOR to the collapse of the bridge is where this event gets truly bizarre.The story begins with journalist John Klein driving through the night to discover that he has blacked out and ended up hundreds of miles away from his intended destination. He ends up in Point Pleasant. The community of Point Pleasant is plagued with  strange encounters from  a giant winged humanoid, and the  townspeople are have disturbing precognition of disasters. The people have nicknamed the creature  THE MOTHMAN because of his wings and eyes.Actual police reports were made concerning the strange sightings of The Mothman.Most of the people who made the police reports met their doom on the Silver Bridge.Was The Mothman some kind of messenger of death? Or was he trying to warn the people?Draw your own conclusions.There is a book titled ""The Mothman Prophecies"" which was written in the early seventies detailing the journalist's adventures in Point Pleasant. I recommend the book as well as an internet search to learn more about these bizarre events. There are also message boards on the internet where survivors of the bridge disaster and their relatives post messages to eachother.

Reporters report what they investigate, so nothing is 100 percent certain in this world, we can listen to evidence, photos, tapes, proof, witnesses, and then conclude what happened based on our own knowledge and judgement, but it doesnt mean something is not true. There is always that possibility, that these things happened, but you definately have to be into this stuff, have an open mind, and have knowledge of the paranormal and phenomena.

The plot takes Gere to the Ohio/West Virginia border where he meets with the local residents who all seem to be having their troubles with strange lights, weird phone calls and a bird like creature which they call the Mothman. Klein investigates the mystery at the cost of his own sanity and career.The film is very scary but lacks the pace and fibre that made the John A. Keel's book an awe inspiring read. There are no Men In Black, UFO's, alien impregnated women, phone tapings or a clear resolution to some of the character's fate. In fact only about 10% of the book is actually reproduced in the film. The other 90% seems to have been plucked from an episode of the `X-files'... but what a good episode it is! This is a film that has high production values. The lighting, camerawork, sound and editing are always on top form which is something that prevents the movie from disappearing into the ranks of science fiction B movie hokum. `The Mothman Prophecies' looks simply `weirdly' gorgeous on the big screen.There is not enough Mothman revealed to the viewer but country folk Gordon Smallwood (the well cast and superbly acted Will Patton) creates a much needed conduit into the effects that the Mothman has on the people of Point Pleasant and this is what the film is really all about - The consequences that the supernatural can have on the psyche of a small backward town's population. Although the ending is Mothman free it certainly does jolt the emotions and evokes a sort of belittling sympathy for the human beings of this planet.Watch this film and then go read the book for a much better look at really went on.

699215,A3HI2HBUS8MITB,B0000648X0,Patrick Hall,"[3, 3]","THE MOTHMAN PROPHESIESThis is a film about the paranormal activities that supposedly took place in West Virginia during the 1960s.  It stars Richard Gere, which immediately raises most peoples suspicions about this being a good horror film, and maybe rightly so.  But it's not the acting that carries the film so much as the creepy storyline and setting that establishes a mood of mystery and danger.Although based on events in the 1960s, the time line in the film is modern and focuses on John Klein (Gere), a successful reporter with a beautiful wife and a rather ordinary life.  The action begins pretty quickly--there is an automobile accident and the wife is found to be harboring a tumor which is terminal.  But before she dies, she draws a number of vicious, moth-like creatures in her notepad.We jump ahead a year or two, and while driving alone at night, Klein's car dies and he suddenly becomes embroiled in a local nightmare of paranormal activities in the town of Point Pleasant hundreds of miles from his intended destination.  One question leads to another, and soon the journalist in Klein is knee-deep in a bizarre story of night-time visitors, unearthly phone calls, and distortions of time and space.  The eyewitness evidence points to a moth-like creature similar to that which his wife drew prior to her death and Klein begins to suspect his excursion to Point Pleasant may not be accidental, but rather planned by some unseen force.The fact is, we are never really sure just what the Mothman is.  In the material plane, we don't even know what the Mothman is.  It doesn't have a physical body (that we ever see), and there are implications it might be electrical or extra-terrestrial.  Nor are we sure about it's mission.  At one point Klein speculates its purpose, but we never really know.  This air of mystery keeps the mood bleak throughout the film, and whenever it seems the Mothman's intentions are good, something will happen that starts our thinking otherwise.  It's a maddening puzzle that spins you in circles, and I think it's why a lot of people don't like the film.  For those who like closure, you won't find any here, but I think that's what the director was going for.  Emphasizing the unknown is an effective tool to produce a frightening landscape.The location and season the film was shot in contributes greatly to this mysterious feeling.  Shooting the film in winter gives it that washed-out look familiar to that time of year, and the cold temperatures mirror the mood perfectly.  The isolated, rural town surrounded by mountains and dotted with industrial symbols (the steel bridge and chemical plant) further lend a sense of chilliness and distance.  The idea that this place is being visited by this inexplicable force renders a feeling of doom and imprisonment, as if this little town so cut off from the light of day is being haunted by a power so great that there is no escaping it.Parts of the movie are a bit hard to follow.  The scene when Klein visits with an expert on the Mothman phenomena is inaudible at times, and the repetitiveness gets stale for a while till the movie moves on to it's final conclusion, but I thought the feel of the movie was scary.  There are a lot of shocking scenes that make you jump, and watching this alone at night can definitely give you the chills.  I guess the idea of a creature like the Mothman with powers of foresight, telepathy, whatever it is, is unnerving.Bottom line here is that the movie keeps your interest and most successfully of all, it draws you into the story.  The characters are engaging, and while we never see a conclusive explanation for the mysterious happenings, this only adds to the appeal of the film.  The ending is also one of the most fantastic I have ever seen and ends the entire saga with a bang.",4,What is the Mothman?,1317945600,"10 7, 2011",2011,3817,"['MOTHMAN', 'PROPHESIESThis', 'film', 'paranormal', 'activities', 'supposedly', 'took', 'place', 'West', 'Virginia', '1960s', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'immediately', 'most', 'peoples', 'suspicions', 'being', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'maybe', 'rightly', 'so', 'not', 'acting', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'creepy', 'storyline', 'setting', 'mood', 'mystery', 'danger.Although', 'based', 'events', '1960s', 'time', 'line', 'film', 'modern', 'John', 'Klein', 'Gere', 'successful', 'reporter', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'rather', 'ordinary', 'life', 'action', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'automobile', 'accident', 'wife', 'found', 'be', 'harboring', 'tumor', 'terminal', 'number', 'vicious', 'moth-like', 'creatures', 'notepad.We', 'jump', 'ahead', 'year', 'two', 'driving', 'alone', 'night', 'Klein', 'car', 'dies', 'suddenly', 'embroiled', 'local', 'nightmare', 'paranormal', 'activities', 'town', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'hundreds', 'miles', 'intended', 'destination', 'One', 'question', 'soon', 'journalist', 'Klein', 'knee-deep', 'bizarre', 'story', 'night-time', 'visitors', 'unearthly', 'phone', 'calls', 'distortions', 'time', 'space', 'eyewitness', 'evidence', 'points', 'moth-like', 'creature', 'similar', 'wife', 'drew', 'prior', 'death', 'Klein', 'suspect', 'excursion', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'accidental', 'rather', 'planned', 'unseen', 'force.The', 'fact', 'are', 'never', 'really', 'sure', 'just', 'what', 'Mothman', 'material', 'plane', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'what', 'Mothman', ""n't"", 'have', 'physical', 'body', 'ever', 'see', 'are', 'implications', 'might', 'be', 'electrical', 'extra-terrestrial', 'are', 'sure', 'mission', 'one', 'point', 'Klein', 'purpose', 'never', 'really', 'know', 'air', 'mystery', 'mood', 'bleak', 'film', 'whenever', 'Mothman', 'intentions', 'are', 'good', 'something', 'will', 'happen', 'thinking', 'otherwise', 'maddening', 'puzzle', 'circles', 'think', 'why', 'lot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'film', 'who', 'closure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'think', 'what', 'director', 'was', 'going', 'Emphasizing', 'unknown', 'effective', 'tool', 'produce', 'frightening', 'landscape.The', 'location', 'season', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'contributes', 'greatly', 'mysterious', 'feeling', 'Shooting', 'film', 'winter', 'washed-out', 'look', 'familiar', 'time', 'year', 'cold', 'temperatures', 'mirror', 'mood', 'perfectly', 'isolated', 'rural', 'town', 'surrounded', 'mountains', 'dotted', 'industrial', 'symbols', 'steel', 'bridge', 'chemical', 'plant', 'further', 'lend', 'sense', 'chilliness', 'distance', 'idea', 'place', 'being', 'visited', 'inexplicable', 'force', 'renders', 'feeling', 'doom', 'imprisonment', 'little', 'town', 'so', 'cut', 'off', 'light', 'day', 'being', 'haunted', 'power', 'so', 'great', 'escaping', 'it.Parts', 'movie', 'are', 'bit', 'hard', 'follow', 'scene', 'when', 'Klein', 'expert', 'Mothman', 'phenomena', 'inaudible', 'times', 'repetitiveness', 'stale', 'while', 'movie', 'final', 'conclusion', 'thought', 'feel', 'movie', 'was', 'scary', 'are', 'lot', 'shocking', 'scenes', 'make', 'jump', 'watching', 'alone', 'night', 'can', 'definitely', 'give', 'chills', 'guess', 'idea', 'creature', 'Mothman', 'powers', 'foresight', 'telepathy', 'whatever', 'unnerving.Bottom', 'line', 'here', 'movie', 'interest', 'most', 'successfully', 'story', 'characters', 'are', 'engaging', 'never', 'see', 'conclusive', 'explanation', 'mysterious', 'happenings', 'only', 'appeal', 'film', 'ending', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'fantastic', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'entire', 'saga', 'bang']",N/A

699217,A1BA72K4VK1UN1,B0000648X0,"Patrick W. Crabtree ""The Old Grottomaster""","[5, 5]","Few movies are as creepy as this one, mainly because there's quite an element in truth to the horror. Compare it to ""The Exorcist"" or maybe ""Ghost Story"" (with Fred Astaire).It's all about the people in a small West Virginia town on the Ohio River who suddenly become plagued with sightings of a VERY scary entity, The Mothman. A big-city newspaper reporter gets on the story and finds a lot more than he bargained for.The Mothman is supposedly associated with an old Shawnee Indian curse on the whites as a result of The Battle of Point Pleasant. Given that basis for the appearance of The Mothman, The Silver Bridge, which spans the Ohio River, fell on a cold December night during the rush hour and many people were killed.This part, anyway, is true... on 12/15/67 The Silver Bridge DID actually fall and 46 people were killed!

I guess the word for it now would be 'thriller,' and thrill it does.Based on a true story from Point Pleasant, West Virginia in 1967, the Mothman takes place in present 2001, or thereabouts. It's the story of a newspaper reporter who finds himself in said town on his way to interview the governor. There he stumbles across several bizarre occurances; namely repeated sightings by the townsfolk of a not-quite-seen ethereal creature, and how these strange tales seem to intertwine with the reporter's own life.The director, Mark Pellington (whose directorial credits include the mediocre movie Arlington Road and the music video of ""Jeremy"" by Pearl Jam) has created a mood and a tension in film that I don't think has appeared since The Exorcist in 1973. And he does so without blood, gore, or cheap scares.And only a PG-13 rating.Mr. Pellington falls backs on some outdated ""tricks"" like good acting, excellent cinematography, and an absolutely stunning soundtrack. Close-ups of the actors' faces here convey more real terror than in all the Friday the 13th films combined. The musical score sets the mood from scene 1 to the finale; dark and foreboding, tense and pensive. Sound work this good should have earned an Oscar nomination. The camera work is beyond reproach, as well. Sometimes long shots, setting a mood, sometimes jerky, fuzzy, or distorted like a funhouse mirror, all perfect to what needs to be conveyed - - without giving away too much.The acting, also, is top notch. Richard Gere, Laura Linney, Will Patton, and Will & Grace's Debra Messing all convey a range of emotions not seen in modern day thrillers in sometime.If there is a flaw to the Mothman Prophecies, it's that the townspeople are too quick to tell a stranger of their paranormal experiences. A moments' hesitation, a shifting away of the eyes, the use of a softer-spoken voice in public would have made the stories and the characters come more alive, and added only a minute or two to the films' overall length.Counting Memento, this is the second great film I've seen in the past thirteen months.

And so much so that I would happily enjoy  movies that most people over 13 would find too childish.. but everything has its' limits!This movie is one of the most demented and boring I have seen in the last few years (and again, I do watch a lot of bad movies:). If you want to spend two hours of your like watching Richard Gere spending most of his time at the phone, in the middle of a scant story that makes no sense whatsoever, well then be my guest, but my advice is avoid this demented flick like plague! The idea goes more or less like this: happy couple, buying a new house, the Mothman urban legend appears to the wife driving back home, causes her to crash and hit her head against the car window. Turns out she is terminally ill with brain tumor. Spends last days drawing mothlike monsters. Makes sense, right? I guess a mothman's work is appearing to terminally ill people and cause them car accidents. But it gets even better. Couple of years later husband find himself by night in the middle of nowhere(Point Pleasant:) ask for help at a house , turns out he 's been there three days consecutively. Now that's mystery! Then husband goes on an interview spree with a hot female agent asking around for Mothman sightings, kind of a cross between agent mulder and scully of X-Files and a Monsterquest episode. And like if that was not enough, the unfortunate owner of the house that husband went knocking at so often starts seeing the Mothman as well, once even calls husband and actually passes him the mothman on the phone ( I am not kidding...!). Of course the only intelligent questions that husband manages to make are a couple of questions to ascertain that the guy on the phone knows everything about what him and what he's doing in that moment..asking about what this is all about would have of been unpolite I guess. Then unfortunate owner of the house that husband went knocking at so often finds nothing better to do than go into a wood and dying of cold (by the way, no snow, no ice, pretty comfortable climate out there, must have taken a while...). If you are starting to get lost at this point don't worry, you're not alone...What else, ah yes husband starts getting hissing phone calls from the Mothman announcing an ominous event. Telling which event of course would have been too trivial, Good job Mothman, keep 'em guessing!  Husband single-handedly decides that the disaster is gonna be in the chemical plant the day of the governor's visit (on the basis of the bad luck that politicians always bring, I guess..).  Turns out he's wrong. Bad Mothman.. bad Mothman....Then husband  gets an anonymous letter saying his dead wife will call him at home at noon Christmas. He rushes back home in Washington, five minutes before noon gets a call from the hot police officer in point pleasant. Call you back in 15 mins? No way he chats with her quite a while and she invites him for Christmas with her family.. how sweet! Take that mothman!  Then when she hastily hangs up since he 's whining and weeping on the phone with no sign of stopping he finally gets the call he 's gone back to Washington for. And what does husband do? But rips phone line off and when the phone keeps ringing anyhow he just ignores it and happily sets for a Merry Christmas a Point Pleasant. Makes sense, right?  Then he finds himself on the collapsing Silver Bridge and guess who is there too, the hot police officer of course. The scene when both her and husband go running around the collapsing bridge telling everyone to &#34;get out of the bridge&#34; is priceless. Nobody would have thought of that otherwise!!! Finally hot police officer closes himself in car so she can drown better and comfortably when the car goes down, but husband is there and jumps down in the river, swims to the bottom and rescues the fainted hot police officer from her underwater car with skill that every journalist have I assume.. So there it is, hot new fiancee saved! Take that , mothman! .. Or thanks Mothman??  You go figure it out.. I guess we' ll never know...Makes sense , right??? :)",1,Totally Demented Flick,1392249600,"02 13, 2014",2014,4168,"['Let', 'begin', 'saying', 'am', 'sucker', 'sci-fi', 'mystery', 'horror', 'movies', 'general', 'so', 'much', 'would', 'happily', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'most', 'people', '13', 'would', 'find', 'too', 'childish..', 'everything', 'limits', 'movie', 'one', 'most', 'demented', 'boring', 'have', 'seen', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'again', 'do', 'watch', 'lot', 'bad', 'movies', 'want', 'spend', 'two', 'hours', 'watching', 'Richard', 'Gere', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'phone', 'middle', 'scant', 'story', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'well', 'then', 'be', 'guest', 'advice', 'avoid', 'demented', 'flick', 'plague', 'idea', 'more', 'less', 'happy', 'couple', 'buying', 'new', 'house', 'Mothman', 'urban', 'legend', 'wife', 'driving', 'back', 'home', 'crash', 'hit', 'head', 'car', 'window', 'out', 'terminally', 'ill', 'brain', 'tumor', 'last', 'days', 'drawing', 'mothlike', 'monsters', 'Makes', 'sense', 'right', 'guess', 'mothman', 'work', 'appearing', 'terminally', 'ill', 'people', 'cause', 'car', 'accidents', 'even', 'better', 'Couple', 'years', 'later', 'husband', 'find', 'night', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'ask', 'help', 'house', 'out', 'been', 'there', 'three', 'days', 'consecutively', 'Now', 'mystery', 'Then', 'husband', 'interview', 'spree', 'hot', 'female', 'agent', 'asking', 'Mothman', 'sightings', 'kind', 'cross', 'agent', 'mulder', 'scully', 'X-Files', 'Monsterquest', 'episode', 'was', 'not', 'enough', 'unfortunate', 'owner', 'house', 'husband', 'went', 'knocking', 'so', 'often', 'seeing', 'Mothman', 'well', 'once', 'even', 'husband', 'actually', 'mothman', 'phone', 'am', 'not', 'kidding', 'course', 'only', 'intelligent', 'questions', 'husband', 'make', 'are', 'couple', 'questions', 'ascertain', 'guy', 'phone', 'everything', 'what', 'what', 'doing', 'moment..asking', 'what', 'about', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'unpolite', 'guess', 'Then', 'unfortunate', 'owner', 'house', 'husband', 'went', 'knocking', 'so', 'often', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'go', 'wood', 'dying', 'cold', 'way', 'snow', 'ice', 'pretty', 'comfortable', 'climate', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'while', 'are', 'starting', 'get', 'lost', 'point', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'re"", 'not', 'alone', 'What', 'else', 'ah', 'yes', 'husband', 'getting', 'hissing', 'phone', 'calls', 'Mothman', 'announcing', 'ominous', 'event', 'Telling', 'event', 'course', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'too', 'trivial', 'Good', 'job', 'Mothman', 'keep', 'guessing', 'Husband', 'single-handedly', 'disaster', 'gon', 'na', 'be', 'chemical', 'plant', 'day', 'governor', 'visit', 'basis', 'bad', 'luck', 'politicians', 'always', 'bring', 'guess..', 'out', 'wrong', 'Bad', 'Mothman..', 'bad', 'Mothman', '.Then', 'husband', 'anonymous', 'letter', 'saying', 'dead', 'wife', 'will', 'call', 'home', 'noon', 'Christmas', 'back', 'home', 'Washington', 'five', 'minutes', 'noon', 'call', 'hot', 'police', 'officer', 'point', 'pleasant', 'Call', 'back', '15', 'mins', 'way', 'while', 'Christmas', 'family..', 'how', 'sweet', 'Take', 'mothman', 'Then', 'when', 'hastily', 'up', 'whining', 'weeping', 'phone', 'sign', 'stopping', 'finally', 'call', 'gone', 'back', 'Washington', 'what', 'husband', 'do', 'phone', 'line', 'when', 'phone', 'ringing', 'anyhow', 'just', 'happily', 'sets', 'Merry', 'Christmas', 'Point', 'Pleasant', 'Makes', 'sense', 'right', 'Then', 'collapsing', 'Silver', 'Bridge', 'guess', 'who', 'there', 'too', 'hot', 'police', 'officer', 'course', 'scene', 'when', 'husband', 'go', 'running', 'around', 'collapsing', 'bridge', 'telling', 'everyone', '34', 'get', 'bridge', '34', 'priceless', 'Nobody', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'otherwise', 'Finally', 'hot', 'police', 'officer', 'car', 'can', 'drown', 'better', 'comfortably', 'when', 'car', 'down', 'husband', 'there', 'jumps', 'down', 'river', 'bottom', 'fainted', 'hot', 'police', 'officer', 'underwater', 'car', 'skill', 'journalist', 'have', 'assume..', 'So', 'hot', 'new', 'fiancee', 'saved', 'Take', 'mothman', '..', 'thanks', 'Mothman', 'go', 'figure', 'out..', 'guess', 'll', 'never', 'know', 'Makes', 'sense', 'right']",N/A

Unfortunately, in this case, the main frustrating trait is the framework itself-the whole Mothman thing, which in the end IS nothing more than a framework. The movie is really about John Klein (Richard Gere) attempting to get over the death of his wife Mary (Debra Messing, from the wonderful, underrated TV series Prey) and fall in love with Point Pleasant sheriff Connie Parker (Laura Linney, previously teamed with Gere in Primal Fear). Never mind that both Messing and Linney are about twenty years younger than the dirty old man...Had that been the main thrust of the movie, it would have been brilliant. Gere gives a stunning performance here as a guy coming gradually unhinged by his inability to get over the death of his spouse. But weaved throughout this love triangle is a whole lot of supposedly supernatural stuff, none of which makes all that much sense (and none of which, of course, is ever resolved-after all, this is ""based on true events"" that were never resolved, either).If you go into this thinking of it as a love story gone horribly awry, you may be able to get as much as I did out of it.

Keel's book on the events. &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; alas, is a movie that wanders completely away from the original story and decides to update it in a puzzling, boring way. The original events, some consider them real others a hoax, took place in 1966, the movie updates the story to 2002 and adds it's own spin on things. This would be fine if the script had been crafted a little better, but instead it wanders around in circles. Plot points are never fully connected or even explained, and we never even get a good look at the Mothman which makes us wonder, why is it even called the MOTHMAN? The photography however, is really well-done and has a nice, mysterious look, like in the early X-Files episodes, but while the material is well-directed, it seems like a puzzle without solutions. At least the original book has it's own explanations, and no matter how out of this world they might seem, they are still explanations. In the film for example, Richard Gere's wife dies as a result from a car crash they were involved in soon after spotting the Mothman, and she begins to draw visions of the creature on paper, ok, interesting. But later in the film no connection is established between her death and the Mothman, in fact, nothing connects in this movie. What exactly are the Mothman Prophecies? The movie has been compared to The X-Files, but The X-Files has always had a continuing thread through-out it's plots and ideas, Mulder is always trying to prove that aliens exist and the government is trying to cover it up, but in &quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; all we get is a heartbroken widower who gets weird phone calls from a husky voice. Is it from the after-life? Is it an alien? For the rental or ticket price, we'd like to know.

I have seen almost every horro/supernatural film, and I like to say I can predict them all very easily.The movie challenged me.  I had no clue what was going to happen.  Richard Gere and Laura Linney (who were so great together in ""Primal Fear""), have great chemistry on screen, and it was a joy to see the two of them together again.  Richard Gere plays a Washington Post journalist who, after getting in an accident with his wife, finds his life turned upside down.  Winding up in Point Pleasant, West Virginia, he encounters a man who claims (well, I don't want to ruin the surprise).  Staying in town to research the strange claims that the locals have made, he finds an ally in  local cop (Linney) who explains that for the past couple of months, ""strange things have been happening"", with even the most upstanding citizen claiming to have seen ""something"".  The film puts you off kilter with its eerie shots, dark nights, and even the ringing of the telephone is enough to put your nerves on edge, because you know something strange is going on, but what is it?  The climax of the film was very intense, and I found myself with my knees drawn up to my chin (thank God for stadium seating).

699236,A2FA18B50XGXJX,B0000648X0,Sam Damon Jr.,"[4, 6]","This is a very good film, you don't feel like you are watching a movie, you feel like you are watching and experiencing REAL LIFE; the audience is robbed of the safety of being detached -- it could be happening to you--- its the very first film to show the real supernatural war going on behind the scenes all over the world today. Read the other reviewers to get the rough outline of the film plot if you haven't seen it.The evil beings haunting our world called the ""Mothmen"" in this story could also be termed ""evil electro-magnetic beings or ""EEMBs"" --the excellent scene where a voice analysis shows that the voices are NOT HUMAN has to be one of the most disturbing ever portrayed on film. Throughout the film, the EEMBs flagrantly speak through telephone receivers plugged in or not--and masquerade perfectly the voices of humans to set them up for their demise. Modern society is increasingly electronic and vulnerable to electromagnetic evil beings to sabotage cars, speak through phones, crash airplanes etc. For starters, EEMBs cause the traffic accident that eventually kills Gere's beloved wife.People today do not see that the world is out to get them--they think the world is ""neutral"" and thus are tactically ill-equipped to defend themselves from supernatural attacks. Consider the principal victims who are mentally attacked by appearances of the thoroughly terrifying Mothman before the final fatal bridge incident: Policewoman played by Laura Linney, pre-marital sex couple, alcoholic plant worker and Gere's character -- a careerist, self-absorbed yuppie dink (Double Income, No Kids).  All are vulnerable to EEMB attack by their lifestyles -- no protection from God and Jesus Christ under the blood shield of atonement. At no point during these supernatural attacks do the townspeople turn to the Bible/God for help. EEMBs can even take human form/appearance: the male nurse in hallway, who vanishes after saying Gere's wife saw ""angels"" is later explained by an excellent prompting scene when Gere sees an outline in a run-down building that free association alerts him that the male nurse was not a human but a/the ""Mothman"" (ie: EEMB). The wife, terminally ill from a brain tumor played by Debra Messing who was seeing and drawing so-called ""angels"" reveals the EEMB's lie/deception since her art shows evil malevolent fallen angels.Gere's missing time while driving alone long after his wife's death results in him appearing in West Virginia - this common UFO/ET phenomena presents the likely possibility that earthly attacks are linked to the same common EEMB instigators. Also note that in rural areas -- people in isolation are more vulnerable to EEMB attacks. This holds true for UFO/ET sightings/abductions. Mothman = EEMB = demons = prince of the power of air's underlings = symbol is self-destructive moth/flame being. Implications: ghosts, ETs, reincarnated being episodes can easily be convincing masquerades to deceive humans by EEMBs who can perfectly mimic human voices/personalities since they have plenty of time to observe and have the powers to do this.Most important scenes: Gere meets Mothman researcher -- he reports the evil beings are sending mixed signals -- they sometimes warn but also seem to also be the instigators of human tragedies -- will not reveal selves/true intentions --the researcher elaborates that the Mothmen have been around forever and throughout human history and thus see life at least 2-3 moves ahead of humans; his window washers-on-a-skyscraper-seeing-an-auto-accident-before-it happens analogy is a very good explanation of how these evil ""prophecies"" can sometimes come true.The film shows several layers of malfeasance -- if you act on prophesies -- it destroys the respectable social life of the human conveyer -- if lives are saved the messenger buys into the validity of evil being's false representations and quasi-goodness. The Mothman phones Gere and tells him to wait for a call from his wife the next day at noon. Minutes before the call, the policewoman gives a fatalistic speech about how people are going to die and there is nothing we can do about it etc etc. but does reveal one kernal of truth -- that the phone call Gere is set to receive ain't gonna be from his wife! She remarks; ""where she is he (the caller masquerading her voice) is not"" -- ie; she's in heaven, he's from hell. Her prior precognitive dreams from EEMBs are elaborate mind screws; she's a single woman unguarded by a male in a very demanding male protective role -- making her very vulnerable --she is outmatched by events throughout the film, but she could have a protector in Gere if he wants the job.However, the rest of the humans are still 1-2 moves behind the Mothmen and are not thinking tactically-- when the evil beings sabotage traffic light on bridge, stalling vehicles on bridge over-stresses support beams causing bridge to collapse, people are naive to blindly follow easily sabotaged traffic light rather than think on their own. Again, humans not realizing that forces are out to get you. Finally, Gere acts courageously at least 1 step ahead of the others around him and dives into water to save the policeman. However the ""wake-up 37"" message from the electromagnetic evil beings mock God whose two numbers are 3 and 7. The saved policewoman,  ""37"" is still victim in that her previous fatalistic views could now flip-flop into a buy-in to the validity of evil electromagnetic beings somehow being agents of goodness. We don't know because the movie ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance glad to just be alive.If you want to be scared, this is the film to do it because its talking about reality not fantasy, but I do not recommend it unless you are certainly under the aegis of Biblical Christianity and the Lord Jesus Christ.",5,Failure to view life tactically can be fatal,1035676800,"10 27,

I'd also heard the book which this film is based on was well-received so I thought I would check it out. The fact that it was based on a true story made it even more exciting.My excitement waned however after the first 30 minutes of sitting through this 2 hour version of an X-Files episode. Aside from a decent bridge collapse scene, I saw absolutely nothing that set it apart, and there was probably better acting on the X-Files. Gere didn't really lend anything to this movie (beside his name) that any other actor couldn't have done. And Debra Messing gave an unconvincing job as a feature actress. At the end of the film, I'm not even sure why she was in it, or what her character's role was.The ""Mothman"" wasn't very scary or very interesting, and i couldn't tell if I was supposed to be more concerned over possible future prophecies or the lead character's mental state.I was left watching a film that was so so, and with a lot of questions that the movie left unexplained. Fortunately, I wasn't interested enough in the film to care.A movie like this should leave you wanting more.

After watching the second disc, the documentary of the Mothman Prophecies, I discovered that the actual eye-witness accounts were much more creepy and eerie than the movie.  I also watched another documentary, 2 hrs. and 35 min. I believe, touching on all points of the movie.  I discovered that most of what happens in the movie actually happened to people either in Pt. Pleasant or somewhere in the vicinity (Indrid Cold, for one, is was experienced by someone from a good distance away from Pt. Pleasant.  Having said that, I thought this was a wonderfully done movie.  I love Richard Gere and Laura Linney.  They are very convincing in their acting.  Definitely buy the two-disc version to see the documentary on disc 2.  And buy the separate disc (""Eyes of the Mothman"") if you want to see something even scarier than the movie.  Some interesting facts are that 46 people died in the disaster, not 36, as in the movie.  The director says, in his commentary, that the ""powers that be"" wouldn't let him give the true number, as it made it sound bad.  Well, it was bad, and I don't think giving the accurate number of 46 is going to hurt.  Also, in the end of the movie, a caption pops up and says that no cause was ever found about why the bridge collapsed.  Actually, this is not true, as this has been studied and it was determined that a single eyebar the first link after the Ohio tower, no. 330, failed, a .1 inch crack forming in it when it failed, causing the entire bridge to fail.  Apparently, there was no technology at the time able to find the flaw (it would have meant taking the eyebar apart) The time it took for the entire bridge to fall into the river was approximately one minute, according to eye-witnesses[...] for a good amount of information on the subject).

After &quot;checking for adequate closet space&quot; they decide to take a nice, spacious house.  Everything appears perfect but within an instant this changes.

The editing and transitions are impeccable, the sound effects exquistite which make the most of the the many moods, especially the scary ones! Each scene is well shot/done and the movie is paced so as to build the suspense and keep the viewer watching with non blinking eyes.

The trailer alone captured none of the feel or items of the book.  Seeing Richard Gere flagged it as a film trying desperately trying to claw at viewers attending movies to see familiar faces with expectations of romantic interest... and that's kind of what this film is: a romance, slice-o-life, drama, holiday, supernatural suspense story.And, yes, it is as muddled as my description.  It just tries to hard to be something which it shouldn't be.  This was a film that either was translated perfectly from a very lack luster script, or it was an idea with a hundred hands influencing the making.  I can't imagine a skilled script writer piecing this together from the book.  The film was probably a real holiday fruitcake shoved full of little fruity bits of story and pap philosophy provided by a cartload of studio fruitcakes bent on influencing something and making it their own.Final analysis: yawn.Good points: it ends.Bad points: none, aside from pacing and lack of story.This could have been a 50 minute made for TV movie.

How could someone have read the book, which is filled with UFOs, cryptids, Men in Black, Government conspiracies, poltergeists, cattle mutilations, strange aliens, strange dopple gangers, weird psychotropic effects and expreiences, paranoia, strange and vaporous entities calling and visiting people, predictions of doom, and then a moment of disaster, and come away with a 2 hour film about a barely tangible thread about an angel of death?  The book was written in a setting so rich and the story of John Keel's investigation is so crazy and amazing that a person would have to be fairly ignorant to not pull out so much of the underlying themes and obvious visuals to make a memorable movie.If you love romantic suspense films that allow you to have sex in the middle without missing any plot when you return to viewing, this is the one to see!If you want a film rich with intense and interesting events boiling over to seat searing finish making you reflect on life and how to live it, skip it.",2,Ding Dong!

I had never heard of what happened in Point Pleasant and so was not expecting a true to life account.  Because of that, I was able to enjoy the movie quite a lot.  It was creepy and exciting, with a tone of lurking menace.  The filming is excellent.  A light hand was taken with the special effects and some psychedelic colorings add interest.  Many of the events in the movie are on the light-fright side, so lovers of serious horror will be disappointed.The basic premise is that John Keel, Washington Post reporter, loses his wife to a brain tumor that is discovered after a car accident.  The car accident is caused when his wife, who was driving, sees the mothman.  Two years later, John takes a 1 1/2 drive, going six hundred miles in the wrong direction to end up in Point Pleasant.  There he begins to have strange experiences and hears rumors of others having similiar experiences.  This puts him hot on the tail, good little investigative reporter that he is, of the mothman - and perhaps his dead wife. I won't tell you more, except that it is worth watching.I love that while the various things happen, nothing is flatly explained.  We don't precisely what the mothman is, what it's motivations are, or even if it is a creature of good or evil.  The uncertainty is lovely!I detracted one star from the DVD (not the movie itself) because I was sorely disappointed to see that there were none of the juicy extras that I love so much with a DVD.  After watching the movie, I was dying to see the cast interviews and what they thought about mothman.

While I still felt the way I did earlier, I would have added another star or two because on DVD I could review scenes and freeze frames to see some really cool imagery that gets lost in the quick cuts.  There seem to be a lot of mysterious elements that never seem to connect but THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES is still an intriguing and frequently chilling experience that left me wanting me more.  Keep your finger on the freeze button!).I grew up near where the Mothman was sighted.  Back then (1960-70s), it was only the real nuts who took the Mothman very seriously.  In the wake of all the UFO lit that hit the market then, everyone focused on the Arkansas fishermen who were abducted by tin-foil aliens instead of giant flying monster with big red insect eyes in West Virginia.The former seemed more plausible, I guess.I still visit West Virginia every year and it's been fun to see the region embrace the Mothman--with tongue firmly planted in cheek.  I bought a couple of recent books about the Mothman in Parkersburg's wonderful Trans Allegheny Bookstore last visit (they are online).  There is even a Mothman statue in Point Pleasant.But the movie, which starts out so promisingly with such an excellent cast, can't pull all the spooky supernatural elements together.Loosely based on the book, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, the film takes it's most intriguing ideas and sets up a really cool story about a reporter (Richard Gere) dealing with the death of his wife--and trying to understand some of the other-worldly weirdness of it.  This wasn't a documentary so the filmmakers should've cut loose and took us further into that weirdness.They should have shown the Mothman.  That they didn't just hurts the movie badly.The first half does a great job of playing the mystery--but we're still left with just the mystery by the end.  This is a movie.  Give us a pay-off.The bridge collapse sequence is so unbelievable that, as cool as it is visually, it's actually more difficult to believe than the Mothman by that point.  The real Silver Bridge crashed in about a nano-second.  The real Ohio River, especially in December, doesn't look like the clear water tank they filmed on a backlot.  And nobody could've survived that.  Sorry.Some really good moments though.  I loved the concepts so much that I wish there had been a couple more drafts of the script to see where it would go.(My own theory as to why the Mothman sightings stopped after the Silver Bridge disaster: the community had a real tragedy to deal with and they just didn't have time for spooky campfire stories anymore.

This is not always good because as readers, we now have bad stuff fresh in our memory instead of what we really should focus on - yeah you guessed it, the good stuff!Well I'm no movie critic; I'm a movie lover. I'll start with the bad stuff, which isn't much.Richard Gere is a good actor. Although he has certainly aged with dignity, he looks kinda old to be matched up with Debra Messing, who plays his wife. He doesn't look half as young as in that picture on the cover - probably taken in his ""Pretty Woman"" age. Or maybe Debra Messing is too young to be matched up with Gere..., this was just my first impression when I saw the two.And to continue bitching, I really wish we could've had a least one more encounter with the Mothman in person before the movie ended. I wanted to see the entity just a little bit more.The story of this movie is vaguely based on supposedly real events, if you didn't know that already. This could easily be just another marketing trick, but regardless of the Mothman being real or not, this movie is VERY real and it's scary as hell.The Mothman is probably one of most eerie creatures ever created for the movies. He fits right in there with villains like Sadako (of Jap. Ringu trilogy) who seem more like forces of Nature rather than actual entities. This Mothman seems so naturally, innately evil, as he completely destroys the life of every victim he makes contact with. Intentionally or unintentionally, he plays with our senses and emotions, throwing us into a mind corroding half reality.Whatever the Mothman is, whether he is a ufo, an alien from a ufo, a demon, a ghost, or a banshee, he so totally non-mixable with the physical laws of our ""human"" reality. He is just ""wrong""! Wrong like Oil & Water or 1+1=3.Simply an abomination, and that is what makes this movie so frightening.Like director Mark Pellington states, it's a struggle between art and commerce. I don't know how well this movie made it with the box office but in my book, art and commerce equals quality and thus go together inseparably. The shots throughout the movie are truly tasteful. There is thought behind every shot and every transition. You feel the presence of the Mothman in the form of his glowing red eyes, manifesting themselves as paired red lights that come naturally with urban surroundings. The forgotten backlights of parked cars, road maintenance stop signs, even a pair of red light decorated Christmas trees just to name a few examples. Truly ingenious!Two other important components that make this movie great are the score and sounds. The constant music pad greatly adds to the feeling of unease, very ""Twin Peaks"".  It becomes almost unbearable with the disturbing Mothman encounters. The sound design match the visual design perfectly, sending cold shivers down your spine as well as making you jump in your seat.  You do NOT want the phone to ring while you watch this movie alone, like I did - and which also happened several times!That's enough praising for the actual movie.This DVD as a product is a lot better than average. Two discs packed with extra features like documentaries and deleted scenes! Who could ask for more, right? The picture and sound is as should be expected. The animated menus fit like a glove, sporting those eerie drawings and the priceless sound pad from the movie.And yes, His staring eyes are ever present in every menu.So there you have it. Another great DVD.Now I have raised your expectations so much that you'll probably be disappointed once you've bought it.

ALL TEN FINGERS UP!!! This movie is one of my top ten thrillers of the century, totally blowing away Don't Say a Word (Michael Douglass), Unbreakable (Bruce Willis), and I am convinced that it has way more replay value than The Sixth Sense (Bruce Willis). Don't get me wrong I loved these three flicks the first time around, especially in the dark huge theater, but the second times for these three made me snooooooooooooozzzzzzzzzzzz. The second time watching Mothman still intrigued me and I saw things I never saw before, it was a whole new experience the second time around.The basic plot is: a series of events refuse to let a Newspaper Writer (Richard Gere) leave a small town where a lot of wierd things are going down. I can't say ANYTHING about this film that wouldn't ruin it, especially if you do not know anything about the Mothman, except that IT ROCKS, it is a definite heartstopper with plenty of shock value and it raises some very interesting questions. The ending was absolutely mesmerizing and totally blew me away BIGTIME. This is one ride you won't want to miss. If you don't believe in things like Bigfoot and Leprechans, have no fear.

The film is eerie, to be sure, but its eerieness sometimes goes beyond the most outrageous episodes of &quot;X-Files,&quot; reaching nearly the edge of pretenciousness.  However, that doesn't mean this film is not worth watching.As other reviewers have explained, I make my summery of the story short.  Richard Gere is Washington Post journalist John Klein, whose wife saw something weird before their car accident.  Two years later, John finds himself in Point Pleasant as if drawn to the place, to know that there are things going on among that peaceful town by the river.  And John himself is about to witness the phonomena very soon.Before you watch, remember this.  The director chooses wisely not to expose the key figure of &quot;Mothman&quot; too much.  It is revealed with indirect ways -- like sketches and witnesses -- and you may be disappointed its vagueness.  But that is the point the director and Gere are making.And under the rather slow and ordinary development of story, there are many things that are really strange.  The sound used here is quite unique, sometimes sounds like David Lynch-like noise, and sometimes like ethnic music.  But the most impressive part is its subliminal effects -- I cannot reveal this part too much, but look close some part of the images on the screen, which would be later return in another form.  Or, one alphabet repeatedly shows up at the crutial moments of the film.  Even the lights of cars seem to have some meaning at the end....But, these &quot;subliminal&quot; parts can be damaging, too, because, after all, the basic idea is as realistic as that of MIB and Loswell.  Of course, many people believe them, but I didn't happen to be one of them.  In that case, the whole picture might look superficial just as the director's previous work &quot;Arlington Road.&quot;  Yes, it was shocking, but do you believe in the whole story?About acting, there is no problem at all.  Maybe you don't buy the idea of Gere playing an ace journalist (and he is getting more and more nervous), but I find he is very good and convincing.  Laura Linney as a local cop is also good, but they are both helped greatly by underrated Will Patton, who gives authentic feeling to the very unbelievable story.The film offers much, but the weakness of the story is undeniable.

He soon finds himself mysteriously translated to the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. He develops a relationship with the sympathetic but skeptical local police sergeant, played by Laura Linney. Klein soon discovers that many of the town's residents have sighted an eerie moth-like entity, similar to the one his wife saw before she died. Deeper investigation causes Klein to have his own creepy encounters with the strange creature; he becomes convinced that the being (or beings) exists on a sphere far beyond humanity's finite comprehension and that it can predict impending calamities. In fact, he comes to realize that this ""mothman"" is trying to warn the small town of one. Can he decipher what specifically the tragedy will be and when it will occure? Can he save his life and his loved ones before it's too late?""The Mothman Prophecies"" is not a monster movie or a mad-slasher horror flick; it's a creepy supernatural/mystery story with loads of mood & atmosphere. Every element of this motion picture skillfully works -- acting, story, editing, score, cinimatography, locations, effects, etc.Sensitive viewers will note an undeniable reverent, beautiful quality to the film. The ending is strangely touching.The notable Amazon reviewer Lawrence Bernabo claims that the mysteries presented in the story are not supposed to be figured out and, indeed, CANNOT be figured out. This is completely untrue. One must understand that this film is brilliantly intricate. Many questions are raised with varying possible answers. Don't think for a second that there are no real answers in this film; they're all there, but you may have to watch it a few times to discover them. I appreciate the fact that the director and writer refused to spell everything out for the viewer, even allowing room for complete misinterpretation. If the viewer wants answers s/he must have ""ears to hear"" and be willing to work for them.My initial interpretation was that the mothmen are good spiritual beings that are trying to help humankind by predicting great calamities but can be easily misunderstood because they are so far superior to humans. In a nutshell my interpretation was that the ""mothman"" brought Gere to Point Pleasant to meet and save the future replacement for his dead wife, who died due to a pre-existing condition that only the mothman knew about. This explanation obviously suggests that the ""mothmen"" are good in nature.I've come to see that this interpretation is false; a brilliantly implemented red herring.***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read the following paragraphs unless you want to consider insights into the true nature of the mothmen)The mothmen are in truth evil spirits, fallen angels or demons (they're synonymous). This is clear when viewing eye-witness drawings of the creatures; these pictures never show beautiful angel-like beings, but rather disturbing, obviously-malevolent winged-creatures.A mothman (evil spirit) CAUSED the auto accident that injured Debra Messing. Would a GOOD angelic being cause such a tragedy (regardless of the fact that she ultimately dies of a pre-existing problem)?The bible calls Satan the ""prince of the power of the air,"" hence, his underlings (demons) are spiritual and electro-magnetic in nature. They can thus easily manipulate a traffic light or speak through a phone that's not plugged in. They can even take human form, like the male nurse who insists Debra's drawings are of ""angels"" and then mysteriously vanishes, or mimic the voices of dead loved ones.The researcher from Chicago reveals that the mothmen are from hell (the spiritual underworld that underpins the earth) and send out mixed messages to ruin peoples lives. They may seem to be benevolently warning humans but, at the same time, are obvious instigators of human tragedies (the car crash, Gordon's job loss, insanity & ultimate demise and the researcher's loss of his family & a respectable social life, etc.). Also consider the fact that they refuse to reveal their true selves and intentions. They are highly skilled masqueraders.The reclusive researcher also points out that they have been around for a millennia and therefore see things at least 2 or 3 moves ahead of humans; they naturally use this vantage point to manipulate, deceive and destroy.At the end, the saved police woman, number ""37"" (research that number), is still a victim  in that her previous views that the mothmen are evil and destructive could now flip-flop into the deception that the they are somehow agents of good. Of course we never find out if this happens because the tale potently ends with Gere and Linney in shock sitting in an ambulance just glad to be alive.The film powerfully illustrates that humanity is caught in a cosmic war and that there are beings whose sole purpose is to ruin or destroy us. Failure to understand and tactically prepare can be fatal. The only true protection from these evil spiritual beings is reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ's blood shield of atonement (not that the picture ever overtly reveals this, it's simply my addendum).***END SPOILER ALERT***""Mothman"" is one of those rare films that you just put on to enjoy the cinematic magic, regardless of whether or not you know the ending or how many times you've seen it; it ranks up there with my all-time favorite movies.",5,"Haunting Mystery with Supernatural Elements -- Reverent, Beautiful, Brilliant",1151366400,"06 27, 2006",2006,5599,"['Mothman',

Wilkinson,"[3, 5]","The Mothman Prophecies is based on a book of the same name, which is based on allegedly true events that took place in West Virginia in the late 1960s, thought similar situations occur in the present day in various parts of the world ... if you believe all that.I'm not going to spoil the plot by discussing anything specific in the movie, but basically I knew the real Mothman story before I saw the movie so I already knew how it would end.  But even if you're like me and you already know what happens, you'll be in for some shocks because the road the movie takes to get to that last scene, last revelation if you will, is an eerie, suspenseful one.  This was actually one of the scariest movies I've seen in a really long time, maybe because all this stuff was supposed to have taken place in real life.  Even though I've had the DVD for like 2 years now I still get the chills every time I watch it.  So in that sense the movie ""works.""And actually, I thought for sure that Richad Gere would ruin the whole thing because I can't get the Officer and a Gentleman impression out of my head, but ... nothing at all was ruined and he turns in a very dramatic performance, even if it is a tad over the top.  And I agree that Debra Messing and Laura Linney's characters were underdeveloped, so ... they're good eye candy, but don't add to or take anything away from your viewing experience.I'd compare Mothman Prophecies to Signs because both have that Alfred Hitchcock feel to them.
