Exiles is particularly disappointing with its thin plot that links occasional emotional high spots and some interesting gypsy music sequences.  The highlights are not enough to compensate for its lack of depth and texture.",2,Falls short,1263945600,"01 20, 2010",2010,328,"['high', 'expectations', 'none', 'Gatlif', 'efforts', 'have', 'met', 'surpassed', 'hallmark', 'film', 'Latcho', 'Drom', 'Exiles', 'particularly', 'disappointing', 'thin', 'plot', 'occasional', 'emotional', 'high', 'spots', 'interesting', 'gypsy', 'music', 'sequences', 'highlights', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'compensate', 'lack', 'depth', 'texture']",Exiles

It is understated but beautifully made. If you are looking for a Hollywood flick don't bother. If you are looking for good cinema and like multicultural stories then this is the one. I absolutely adore Romain Duris and Lubna Azabal in whatever they do.

The film is propelled by a pulsating soundtrack featuring Middle Eastern and Spanish gypsy rhythms that is sometimes pretentious (especially during the opening song) but always catchy and interesting.  The plotlines is incredulous at times and the shots are also too obviously intended to be symbolic and socially meaningful, at the expense of credibility, but Romain Duris and Lubna Azabal, as the couple searching for meaning and identity by travelling to Algiers, are two of the most interesting and watchable young stars working in French cinema today and make the cinematic road trip to Algeria worthwhile.",4,A Road Movie to Algiers,1160956800,"10 16, 2006",2006,777,"['road', 'movie', 'pair', 'Parisian', 'bohemians', 'travels', 'Algeria', 'way', 'Southern', 'Spain', 'where', 'have', 'family', 'ties', 'French', 'hers', 'Arab', 'film', 'propelled', 'pulsating', 'soundtrack', 'featuring', 'Middle', 'Eastern', 'Spanish', 'gypsy', 'rhythms', 'sometimes', 'pretentious', 'especially', 'opening', 'song', 'always', 'catchy', 'interesting', 'plotlines', 'incredulous', 'times', 'shots', 'are', 'also', 'too', 'obviously', 'intended', 'be', 'symbolic', 'socially', 'meaningful', 'expense', 'credibility', 'Romain', 'Duris', 'Lubna', 'Azabal', 'couple', 'searching', 'meaning', 'identity', 'travelling', 'Algiers', 'are', 'two', 'most', 'interesting', 'watchable', 'young', 'stars', 'working', 'French', 'cinema', 'today', 'make', 'cinematic', 'road', 'trip', 'Algeria', 'worthwhile']",Exiles

Gatlif won the Best Director prize at Cannes for this. The male lead, Romain Duris, was in the director's earlier ""Gadjo Dilo"" - another fine film.

In the course of the film we learn that young man's parents were killed in a car accedent when he was a child.  Young woman's father was married to a French woman and never thought his daughter to speak Algerian.  Both of these young people are damaged.  But there weaknesses make them perfect for each other.  On their trip through Spain, they meet brother and sister from Algeria who are on their way to Paris to find work.  To them it is incomprehensible why these two lovers speak no language of their ancestry and why they are going into a place both brother and sister are trying to escape from.It is an interesting film about self-discovery, sexual awakening, national identity and spirituality strapped from religion.  Differences in all its absurdity: language, the way we dress, interact with each other and treat each other.",3,Finding one's own identity,1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,948,"['young', 'couple', 'Algerian', 'descent', 'lives', 'Paris', 'One', 'day', 'whim', 'decide', 'go', 'Algeria', 'foot', 'course', 'film', 'learn', 'young', 'man', 'parents', 'were', 'killed', 'car', 'accedent', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Young', 'woman', 'father', 'was', 'married', 'French', 'woman', 'never', 'thought', 'daughter', 'speak', 'Algerian', 'young', 'people', 'are', 'damaged', 'weaknesses', 'make', 'perfect', 'other', 'trip', 'Spain', 'meet', 'brother', 'sister', 'Algeria', 'who', 'are', 'way', 'Paris', 'find', 'work', 'incomprehensible', 'why', 'two', 'lovers', 'speak', 'language', 'ancestry', 'why', 'are', 'going', 'place', 'brother', 'sister', 'are', 'trying', 'escape', 'from.It', 'interesting', 'film', 'self-discovery', 'sexual', 'awakening', 'national', 'identity', 'spirituality', 'strapped', 'religion', 'Differences', 'absurdity', 'language', 'way', 'dress', 'interact', 'other', 'treat', 'other']",Exiles

The pair has only vague memories of Algeria, most of what they know has been told to them by their parents and family.  They have little money, so they must walk and work their way into and through Spain, then hop a boat across the Mediterranean Sea.  Along the way they encounter a wide range of migrant people living in Europe.  They fall in with gypsies for a while, they also encounter illegal Algerian and Moroccan immigrants who are working their way north to Paris.  For much of this film, the wanderers are heading in the opposite direction as everyone else.  After a few mis-adventures, they finally get to Morocco, take a bus to the Algerian border, and with some help illegally cross into Algeria.  Once there, they find that life in Algeria isn't quite what they had envisioned.  For all of their attachment, they really are strangers to this land.  They do find however, that there is much to learn and much to value in Algeria, even if it is quite different than Paris.There is a lot to like about this film.  The main themes of this film are identity and culture clash.  The immigrants identify with a culture that they barely recognize, but after some difficult adjustments they realize that there is much to be proud of.  As mentioned in the other reviews, there is lots of great Magrebian music played on traditional instruments played through out the movie.  Very nice performances by Lubna Azabal and (particularly well acted) Romain Duris.  This film provides an interesting window into the life and culture of illegal immigrants from North Africa in Europe, as well as some insights into modern Algeria.  In my opinion, there are some similarities in theme between this film and the early 70s film Walkabout with Jenny Agutter.  In any case, this is a good story about voyage of exploration and self-identity, definitely worth a look, if not uniquely outstanding.",4,2nd Generation Algerian immigrants in France in search of the their roots,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,2059,"['Two', 'second', 'generation', 'twenty-something', 'Algerian', 'immigrants', 'living', 'together', 'Paris', 'decide', 'want', 'return', 'roots', 'spontaneously', 'go', 'journey', 'Algeria', 'pair', 'only', 'vague', 'memories', 'Algeria', 'most', 'what', 'know', 'been', 'told', 'parents', 'family', 'have', 'little', 'money', 'must', 'walk', 'work', 'way', 'Spain', 'then', 'boat', 'Mediterranean', 'Sea', 'way', 'encounter', 'wide', 'range', 'migrant', 'people', 'living', 'Europe', 'fall', 'gypsies', 'while', 'also', 'encounter', 'illegal', 'Algerian', 'Moroccan', 'immigrants', 'who', 'are', 'working', 'way', 'Paris', 'much', 'film', 'wanderers', 'are', 'heading', 'opposite', 'direction', 'everyone', 'else', 'few', 'mis-adventures', 'finally', 'get', 'Morocco', 'take', 'bus', 'Algerian', 'border', 'help', 'illegally', 'cross', 'Algeria', 'Once', 'there', 'find', 'life', 'Algeria', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'had', 'envisioned', 'attachment', 'really', 'are', 'strangers', 'land', 'do', 'find', 'however', 'much', 'learn', 'much', 'value', 'Algeria', 'even', 'quite', 'different', 'Paris.There', 'lot', 'like', 'film', 'main', 'themes', 'film', 'are', 'identity', 'culture', 'clash', 'immigrants', 'identify', 'culture', 'barely', 'recognize', 'difficult', 'adjustments', 'realize', 'much', 'be', 'proud', 'mentioned', 'other', 'reviews', 'lots', 'great', 'Magrebian', 'music', 'played', 'traditional', 'instruments', 'played', 'movie', 'Very', 'nice', 'performances', 'Lubna', 'Azabal', 'particularly', 'well', 'acted', 'Romain', 'Duris', 'film', 'interesting', 'window', 'life', 'culture', 'illegal', 'immigrants', 'North', 'Africa', 'Europe', 'as', 'well', 'insights', 'modern', 'Algeria', 'opinion', 'are', 'similarities', 'theme', 'film', 'early', '70s', 'film', 'Jenny', 'Agutter', 'case', 'good', 'story', 'voyage', 'exploration', 'self-identity', 'definitely', 'look', 'not', 'uniquely', 'outstanding']",Exiles
