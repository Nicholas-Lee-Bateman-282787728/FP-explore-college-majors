He wanted to see it so badly, but the cost per episode, for a rental, was just more than we could justify. He was thrilled when the series came out on Blu-Ray.Unlike some anime series that seem to go on forever, this series comes to conclusion after season two. You should, however, be aware that the seasons do not stand alone. Season one ends on a cliff hanger, and if you only watch season two you will be beyond confused. (Honestly, you may still be a little confused if you watch both seasons.)The story has a lot of classic love story elements in it. There is a lot of action and a lot of conflict, but for me the center of the story is a tale that has been told over and over again. Best friends are in love with the same girl, but she's always known where her heart belongs. The side stories are as compelling as the main story; they are stories about the different ways we love each other. A mother's love for her child, an older sister's love for her younger sister, and the sacrifices we are willing to make for the ones we love the most.If you are looking for a cute and fluffy anime, this is not for you. Xam'd is not afraid to break your heart by killing off a character they made you love, and in the end, not every character gets to live their happily ever after. There was something about this anime, although I'm not sure what, that reminded me ofEureka Seven.Overall, I don't know if this is one of those series that you just HAVE to own, but it is well worth watching. I'm pretty sure that we never watched less than three episodes in a sitting, and we finished the second series in a weekend. It's hard to turn off, and even when it ends, you'll find yourself wanting more.",4,I'll be Xam'd,1296604800,"02 2, 2011",2011,1773,"['thought', 'husband', 'head', 'was', 'going', 'explode', 'when', 'series', 'came', 'PSN', 'wanted', 'see', 'so', 'badly', 'cost', 'episode', 'rental', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'could', 'justify', 'was', 'thrilled', 'when', 'series', 'came', 'out', 'Blu-Ray.Unlike', 'anime', 'series', 'seem', 'go', 'forever', 'series', 'conclusion', 'season', 'two', 'should', 'however', 'be', 'aware', 'seasons', 'do', 'not', 'stand', 'alone', 'Season', 'one', 'cliff', 'hanger', 'only', 'watch', 'season', 'two', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'Honestly', 'may', 'still', 'be', 'little', 'confused', 'watch', 'seasons', 'story', 'lot', 'classic', 'love', 'story', 'elements', 'lot', 'action', 'lot', 'conflict', 'center', 'story', 'tale', 'been', 'told', 'over', 'again', 'Best', 'friends', 'are', 'love', 'same', 'girl', 'always', 'known', 'where', 'heart', 'belongs', 'side', 'stories', 'are', 'as', 'compelling', 'main', 'story', 'are', 'stories', 'different', 'ways', 'love', 'other', 'mother', 'love', 'child', 'older', 'sister', 'love', 'younger', 'sister', 'sacrifices', 'are', 'willing', 'make', 'ones', 'love', 'most.If', 'are', 'looking', 'cute', 'fluffy', 'anime', 'not', 'Xam', ""'d"", 'not', 'afraid', 'break', 'heart', 'killing', 'off', 'character', 'made', 'love', 'end', 'not', 'character', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'was', 'something', 'anime', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'reminded', 'Seven.Overall', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'one', 'series', 'just', 'HAVE', 'own', 'well', 'worth', 'watching', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'sure', 'never', 'watched', 'less', 'three', 'episodes', 'sitting', 'finished', 'second', 'series', 'weekend', 'hard', 'turn', 'off', 'even', 'when', ""'ll"", 'find', 'wanting', 'more']",N/A

1362923,A275CBNRP5RG1I,B003TX8QBK,HiroNotHero,"[12, 13]","This blu-ray box set collects the first half, epiosodes 1-13, of this awesome sci-fi action/drama anime series. The animation is sleek, from the backgrounds to the characters themselves. The animation studio Bones, also responsible for series like Fullmetal Alchemist and Darker Than Black, does an amazing job bringing this intriguing series to life. The accompanying soundtrack is also very well done and fits the mood and theme of the show. Plus, the character designs are nice. This release yet again shows why anime is best when viewed in full HD.The story is basically about a normal high school boy turns into a superhuman-like warrior called Xamdou when a mysterious girl implants a gem into his arm. From there on out, he has to leave his hometown, friends, and family behind to battle other superhuman-type beings. The depiction of how the boy deals with this new found power and how it effects the people around him is at times humorous, dramatic, and other times heart-wrenching. You're left wanting to find out what is going to happen to him and his friends, new found allies, and family from episode to episode. Yes, it's really that gripping, in my honest opinion. Definitely not your typical sci-fi action/drama anime show. Highly recommended.",5,Intriguing Sci-fi Action/Drama Anime,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,1259,"['blu-ray', 'box', 'set', 'first', 'half', '1-13', 'awesome', 'sci-fi', 'action/drama', 'anime', 'series', 'animation', 'sleek', 'backgrounds', 'characters', 'animation', 'studio', 'Bones', 'also', 'responsible', 'series', 'Fullmetal', 'Alchemist', 'Darker', 'Than', 'Black', 'amazing', 'job', 'bringing', 'intriguing', 'series', 'life', 'accompanying', 'soundtrack', 'also', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'mood', 'theme', 'show', 'character', 'designs', 'are', 'nice', 'release', 'yet', 'again', 'why', 'anime', 'best', 'when', 'viewed', 'full', 'HD.The', 'story', 'basically', 'normal', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'superhuman-like', 'warrior', 'called', 'Xamdou', 'when', 'mysterious', 'girl', 'implants', 'gem', 'arm', 'there', 'out', 'leave', 'hometown', 'friends', 'family', 'battle', 'other', 'superhuman-type', 'beings', 'depiction', 'how', 'boy', 'deals', 'new', 'found', 'power', 'how', 'effects', 'people', 'times', 'humorous', 'dramatic', 'other', 'times', 'heart-wrenching', ""'re"", 'left', 'wanting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'friends', 'new', 'found', 'allies', 'family', 'episode', 'episode', 'Yes', 'really', 'gripping', 'honest', 'opinion', 'Definitely', 'not', 'typical', 'sci-fi', 'action/drama', 'anime', 'show', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
1362924,AFV2584U13XP3,B003TX8QBK,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[1, 3]","After seeing two episodes I thought that it would be an enjoyable series to get but after finally seeing the series all I can feel is disappointment and confusion on why I got this in the first place.  One of the major things I've said before I like in my series is the ability to emphasize with the characters and the situations they are going through,  and while there are traumatic events going on during the series you feel almost no trepidation to what's going to happen to the people as none really endear themselves to you.  Actually there are a few characters you wouldn't mind seeing killed off for their apparent apathy to the people they supposedly care for which makes them more unlikable and feeling less uncaring if they die in the series which is sad since almost half of them are the main characters in the series.  The animation I think will remind people a lot of another series Eureka Seven and also with the storyline which almost seems a mix of E7 and another confusing series Neon Genesis Evangelion.  The action scenes won't be like other series like Gundam an the like and that's to be expected but still even as you watch these battle scenes they seem to be more boring and you just feel like skipping these scenes over.  So is the series worth getting?,  that is a hard question to answer all I can say is check a few episodes online and see if you truly feel the series is worth getting for your own anime collection...",3,Somewhat Intriguing But Forgettable At The End,1295568000,"01 21, 2011",2011,1446,"['seeing', 'two', 'episodes', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'series', 'get', 'finally', 'seeing', 'series', 'can', 'feel', 'disappointment', 'confusion', 'why', 'got', 'first', 'place', 'One', 'major', 'things', ""'ve"", 'said', 'like', 'series', 'ability', 'emphasize', 'characters', 'situations', 'are', 'going', 'are', 'traumatic', 'events', 'going', 'series', 'feel', 'almost', 'trepidation', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'people', 'none', 'really', 'endear', 'Actually', 'are', 'few', 'characters', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'killed', 'off', 'apparent', 'apathy', 'people', 'supposedly', 'care', 'more', 'unlikable', 'feeling', 'less', 'uncaring', 'die', 'series', 'sad', 'almost', 'half', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'series', 'animation', 'think', 'will', 'remind', 'people', 'lot', 'series', 'Eureka', 'Seven', 'also', 'storyline', 'almost', 'mix', 'E7', 'confusing', 'series', 'Neon', 'Genesis', 'Evangelion', 'action', 'scenes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'other', 'series', 'Gundam', 'like', 'be', 'expected', 'still', 'even', 'watch', 'battle', 'scenes', 'seem', 'be', 'more', 'boring', 'just', 'feel', 'skipping', 'scenes', 'over', 'series', 'getting', 'hard', 'question', 'answer', 'can', 'say', 'check', 'few', 'episodes', 'online', 'see', 'truly', 'feel', 'series', 'getting', 'own', 'anime', 'collection']",N/A

The plot lines, characters - even the equipment - all are captivating. Doctor Ryuzo - his past, and self-inflicted atonements. But, man, his wife - I just wished someone would shoot her - her character was just so spiteful, full of hate and annoying. Just examples of two of the well fleshed-out minor characters. They are all very real.  There's the required unrequited love with the two major players, Akiyuki and Nakiami, and among several of the other characters as well.Many of the voice-actors were recognizable - after looking them up I found they were also in many of my favorite Anime. Full-Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Vexile, Vandread, Speed Grapher, Gunsmith Cats and many more. It's an all-star cast - voice quality to match the production quality.On to the action - there's plenty of it. One on one fights, aerial combat, giant monster sized critters - petty much everything. But little is gratuitous - 95% is directly related to the plot.If you liked Full Metal Alchemist, Vexile, Elfen Lied, Full Metal Panic, Claymore - anything along those lines, you'll really enjoy this series.",5,Somethng unique in the world of Anime,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,1198,"['animation', 'series', 'simply', 'amazing', 'swear', 'was', 'motion', 'captured', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'plot', 'lines', 'characters', 'even', 'equipment', 'are', 'captivating', 'Doctor', 'Ryuzo', 'past', 'self-inflicted', 'atonements', 'man', 'wife', 'just', 'wished', 'someone', 'would', 'shoot', 'character', 'was', 'just', 'so', 'spiteful', 'full', 'hate', 'annoying', 'Just', 'examples', 'two', 'well', 'fleshed-out', 'minor', 'characters', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'required', 'unrequited', 'love', 'two', 'major', 'players', 'Akiyuki', 'Nakiami', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'well.Many', 'voice-actors', 'were', 'recognizable', 'looking', 'up', 'found', 'were', 'also', 'many', 'favorite', 'Anime', 'Full-Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Brotherhood', 'Vexile', 'Vandread', 'Speed', 'Grapher', 'Gunsmith', 'Cats', 'many', 'more', 'all-star', 'cast', 'voice', 'quality', 'match', 'production', 'quality.On', 'action', 'plenty', 'One', 'one', 'fights', 'aerial', 'combat', 'giant', 'monster', 'sized', 'critters', 'petty', 'much', 'everything', 'little', 'gratuitous', '95', '%', 'directly', 'related', 'plot.If', 'liked', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Alchemist', 'Vexile', 'Elfen', 'Lied', 'Full', 'Metal', 'Panic', 'Claymore', 'anything', 'lines', ""'ll"", 'really', 'enjoy', 'series']",N/A
1362926,A2KK41J72RFWIP,B003TX8QBK,Willm,"[1, 2]",I was disappoint to see that the anime was only up for rental on the Playstation Network for about $4 an episode. When I heard that Xam'd was getting a Blu-Ray release - I jumped onto the opportunity of owning it. Great anime - great artwork - well worth the purchase. It ends on a bad note due it feeling more of sucker punch than actually having any closure - but the second season looks to be so much better than what was already delivered here.
