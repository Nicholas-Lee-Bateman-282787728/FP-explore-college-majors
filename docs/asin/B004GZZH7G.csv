I was into the more serious mode of him.  My rating was based on the unanswered Questions about Miou's parents, if Kenichi every got strong enough to even come close to Miou's superior fighting skills.  Because his training was focused with the masters, I felt he should of become a better fighter.  If this really isn't the end I'd change my rating to a 4.  This series is built like a long series anime usually is.  I hope they don't stop there.  There's also the Chinese master's daughter that had an unfinished plot too.  The fights are good though!

1407592,A17PNW5KFXRDT3,B004GZZH7G,fsnva,"[1, 1]","The plot for Kenichi: the Mightiest Disciple is simple and straight forward: timid high school boy, Kenichi, decides to become a martial arts master to impress a girl.  From there the story goes forward as Kenichi moves into the Ryosanpoku dojo and undergoes grueling training under 6 different martial arts masters.  In time, Kenichi becomes a most proficient fighter, which is a good thing since he has run afoul of Ragnarok, a vicious gang of street fighters with eight masters of their own.There are many things to like about this series: great animation; very interesting and well developed characters, especially among the supporting cast; great humor; female characters with big breasts; and a story that really moves along.  One of the best parts of Kenichi is the fight scenes, which are fast moving and well staged.  The voice actors, especially on the English dubbed versions are well matched to their characters, and veteran Anime watchers will instantly recognize Christopher Sabat from his work on One Piece and Dragon Ball Z.Kenichi: the Mightiest Disciple could best be described as a small scale epic, it doesn't have a convoluted mythology as a back story and is set in the ""real"" world; there is no one with God like powers squaring off with an equally omnipotent foe.  For Kenichi, it all comes down to hard work and hours and hours of intense training while picking up the wisdom of his sometimes less than sympathetic masters.  And what young Kenichi lacks in natural talent, he makes up for with heart and determination.  Along the way, Kenichi learns that sometimes the true art is the art of making friends, and by the end of the second season, when the final show down with Ragnarok comes, Kenichi has proven himself so well, that such former foes as Takeda, Siegfried, Hermit, and Thor are willing to stand with him and proudly proclaim their friendship.I did think that early in the series they overdid Kenichi's timidness and the way his character whined and cried in every episode could grow irritating, but by the second season it was thankfully toned down; and there is a plot twist concerning Kenichi, Miu, and the main villain Ryuto, that seems contrived and shoe horned into the series to give their final battle more meaning.  But at a mere fifty episodes, this series seems way too short and leaves the viewer wanting more.  There has been at least one OVA and talk of picking up the series for a season 3.All in all, Kenichi: the Mightiest Disciple has a story that's easy to follow, great characters and good animation; the kind of Anime that people who normally don't want to watch this kind of thing might enjoy.Did I mention it has female characters with big breasts?",5,"Even if you don't like Anime, you might like this.",1342483200,"07 17, 2012",2012,2709,"['plot', 'Kenichi', 'Mightiest', 'Disciple', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'timid', 'high', 'school', 'boy', 'Kenichi', 'become', 'martial', 'arts', 'master', 'impress', 'girl', 'story', 'forward', 'Kenichi', 'Ryosanpoku', 'dojo', 'undergoes', 'grueling', 'training', '6', 'different', 'martial', 'arts', 'masters', 'time', 'Kenichi', 'most', 'proficient', 'fighter', 'good', 'thing', 'run', 'afoul', 'Ragnarok', 'vicious', 'gang', 'street', 'fighters', 'eight', 'masters', 'are', 'many', 'things', 'like', 'series', 'great', 'animation', 'very', 'interesting', 'well', 'developed', 'characters', 'especially', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'humor', 'female', 'characters', 'big', 'breasts', 'story', 'really', 'along', 'One', 'best', 'parts', 'Kenichi', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'fast', 'moving', 'well', 'staged', 'voice', 'actors', 'especially', 'English', 'dubbed', 'versions', 'are', 'well', 'matched', 'characters', 'veteran', 'Anime', 'watchers', 'will', 'instantly', 'recognize', 'Christopher', 'Sabat', 'work', 'One', 'Piece', 'Dragon', 'Ball', 'Z.Kenichi', 'Mightiest', 'Disciple', 'could', 'best', 'be', 'described', 'small', 'scale', 'epic', ""n't"", 'have', 'convoluted', 'mythology', 'back', 'story', 'set', 'real', 'world', 'one', 'God', 'powers', 'squaring', 'off', 'equally', 'omnipotent', 'foe', 'Kenichi', 'down', 'hard', 'work', 'hours', 'hours', 'intense', 'training', 'picking', 'up', 'wisdom', 'sometimes', 'less', 'sympathetic', 'masters', 'what', 'young', 'Kenichi', 'lacks', 'natural', 'talent', 'up', 'heart', 'determination', 'way', 'Kenichi', 'true', 'art', 'art', 'making', 'friends', 'end', 'second', 'season', 'when', 'final', 'show', 'down', 'Ragnarok', 'Kenichi', 'proven', 'so', 'well', 'such', 'former', 'foes', 'Takeda', 'Siegfried', 'Hermit', 'Thor', 'are', 'willing', 'stand', 'proudly', 'proclaim', 'friendship.I', 'did', 'think', 'early', 'series', 'overdid', 'Kenichi', 'timidness', 'way', 'character', 'whined', 'cried', 'episode', 'could', 'grow', 'irritating', 'second', 'season', 'was', 'thankfully', 'toned', 'down', 'plot', 'twist', 'concerning', 'Kenichi', 'Miu', 'main', 'villain', 'Ryuto', 'contrived', 'shoe', 'horned', 'series', 'give', 'final', 'battle', 'more', 'meaning', 'mere', 'fifty', 'episodes', 'series', 'way', 'too', 'short', 'viewer', 'wanting', 'more', 'been', 'least', 'one', 'OVA', 'talk', 'picking', 'up', 'series', 'season', '3.All', 'Kenichi', 'Mightiest', 'Disciple', 'story', 'easy', 'follow', 'great', 'characters', 'good', 'animation', 'kind', 'Anime', 'people', 'who', 'normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'kind', 'thing', 'might', 'enjoy.Did', 'mention', 'female', 'characters', 'big', 'breasts']",N/A
