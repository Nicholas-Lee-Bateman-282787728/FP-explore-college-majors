1642952,A36GXV20FJN3ZV,B00C70FFUG,JB,"[5, 5]",This is an interesting take on &#34;Tosca&#34; in that it was filmed at the times of day in which the story unfolds.  The opening helicopter shot as it circles Rome in the morning fog as it descends onto the actual church where the story begins.The opera unfolds in royal and regal splendor with spectacular sets and costumes and an unseen orchestra that will pull your socks up and your pants down!The Second ACT is spectacular in that it was actually shot in the palace where the action was supposed to have taken place.The Third ACT is powerful in that you are actually witnessing the action on the roof of the fortress.Singing is (naturally) spectacular with the orchestra's booming in the backgrounds.I highly recommend this for an unusual experiencing this &#34;GRAND OPERA&#34; produced brilliantly in 'todays' knowledge . . . no camera tricks or dubbing to be seen.,5,Pants down and socks UP!,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2013,873,"['interesting', 'take', '34', 'Tosca', '34', 'was', 'filmed', 'times', 'day', 'story', 'unfolds', 'opening', 'helicopter', 'shot', 'Rome', 'morning', 'fog', 'actual', 'church', 'where', 'story', 'begins.The', 'opera', 'unfolds', 'royal', 'regal', 'splendor', 'spectacular', 'sets', 'costumes', 'unseen', 'orchestra', 'will', 'pull', 'socks', 'up', 'pants', 'down', 'Second', 'ACT', 'spectacular', 'was', 'actually', 'shot', 'palace', 'where', 'action', 'was', 'supposed', 'have', 'taken', 'place.The', 'Third', 'ACT', 'powerful', 'are', 'actually', 'witnessing', 'action', 'roof', 'fortress.Singing', 'naturally', 'spectacular', 'orchestra', 'booming', 'backgrounds.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'unusual', 'experiencing', '34', 'GRAND', 'OPERA', '34', 'produced', 'brilliantly', ""'todays"", 'knowledge', 'camera', 'dubbing', 'be', 'seen']",Tosca: Live in Rome

Domingo had a cold and it shows a bit in his breathing but otherwise he sang beautifully as did Malfitano.  This followed the movie by Domingo about 25 years hence and he sounded as good as in the original film.  Filmed at the places and times of Puccini's score with Zubin about 4 miles away in a warehouse with the orchestra.  The feat was broadcast to many, many countries in real time and was an event then - the U. S. wasn't one of them as we are known for not appreciating opera in the rest of the world.  Probably sad, but true.  This is one of the best out on DVD, along with the original filmed version and the new one from Covent Garden with Angela, Kaufmann and Terfel.",5,One of the Best Toscas on DVD.,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",2013,764,"['Glad', 'finally', 'out', 'DVD', 'Have', 'had', 'watch', 'tape', 'worn', 'out', 'Domingo', 'had', 'cold', 'bit', 'breathing', 'otherwise', 'sang', 'beautifully', 'did', 'Malfitano', 'followed', 'movie', 'Domingo', '25', 'years', 'hence', 'sounded', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'film', 'Filmed', 'places', 'times', 'Puccini', 'score', 'Zubin', '4', 'miles', 'away', 'warehouse', 'orchestra', 'feat', 'was', 'broadcast', 'many', 'many', 'countries', 'real', 'time', 'was', 'event', 'then', 'U.', 'S.', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'are', 'known', 'not', 'appreciating', 'opera', 'rest', 'world', 'Probably', 'sad', 'true', 'one', 'best', 'out', 'DVD', 'original', 'filmed', 'version', 'new', 'one', 'Covent', 'Garden', 'Angela', 'Kaufmann', 'Terfel']",Tosca: Live in Rome
1642954,A1PX0EMRI4561,B00C70FFUG,"Richard R. Hays ""Movie affectionado""","[5, 6]","I loved it! To see the original locations for this opera was far better than any stage production. An excellent production on all counts. I found the singing and music outstanding. I was glued to the TV screen for each act. I have seen other production but never in authentic settings. So truly visual. When Scarpia, at the end of the first act, kisses the robe of the Holy Father and raises his eyes upward, I could clearly see his lust for Tosca. The juxtaposition of his evil in the house of God was the beginning of his downfall. Tosca's courage in the face of such evil demonstrated the strength of her character. I found similar courage by Madama Butterfly.I could go on, but enough.",5,Rare original settings.,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",2013,689,"['loved', 'see', 'original', 'locations', 'opera', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'stage', 'production', 'excellent', 'production', 'counts', 'found', 'singing', 'music', 'outstanding', 'was', 'glued', 'TV', 'screen', 'act', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'production', 'never', 'authentic', 'settings', 'So', 'truly', 'visual', 'When', 'Scarpia', 'end', 'first', 'act', 'robe', 'Holy', 'Father', 'eyes', 'upward', 'could', 'clearly', 'see', 'lust', 'Tosca', 'juxtaposition', 'evil', 'house', 'God', 'was', 'beginning', 'downfall', 'Tosca', 'courage', 'face', 'such', 'evil', 'demonstrated', 'strength', 'character', 'found', 'similar', 'courage', 'Madama', 'Butterfly.I', 'could', 'go', 'enough']",Tosca: Live in Rome

Ascher,"[14, 14]","Unfortunate that Amazon chooses to combine reviews of blu-ray and DVD versions of operas.The blu-ray copy I received opened on a top menu with just a blank blue bar with no means of selecting options or any way to make it play.  Pity.  I've owned this version on laserdisc and potentially the best version out there.  Was really looking forward to having this.  Other caveat, the box that it came in states that it is remastered in high definition from the original master tape.  So, potentially good picture. But would not be wide screen nor HD sound.  Still, would be worth having if they solve problem of opening menu and ability to play!Be very clear that my review is of the blu-ray version.  I've returned the blu-ray disc and have ordered the DVD.Update 8/19/2013. Apparently the blu-ray and DVD both are old style 4:3 aspect ratio and PCM sound.  Lacking HD sound, 5.1 surround and wide-screen.  So even if you can get a blu-ray that plays, no benefit in buying.  Thanks for clarification from other reviewers and those who have commented.  Nonetheless, possibly the best performance given the principals, direction and settings.  So worth having.  Just not technically what I had hoped for!",4,Superb performance with technical caveats...,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,1199,"['Unfortunate', 'Amazon', 'combine', 'reviews', 'blu-ray', 'DVD', 'versions', 'operas.The', 'blu-ray', 'copy', 'received', 'opened', 'top', 'menu', 'just', 'blank', 'blue', 'bar', 'means', 'selecting', 'options', 'way', 'make', 'play', 'Pity', ""'ve"", 'owned', 'version', 'laserdisc', 'potentially', 'best', 'version', 'there', 'Was', 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'having', 'Other', 'caveat', 'box', 'came', 'states', 'remastered', 'high', 'definition', 'original', 'master', 'tape', 'So', 'potentially', 'good', 'picture', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'wide', 'screen', 'HD', 'sound', 'Still', 'would', 'be', 'worth', 'having', 'solve', 'problem', 'opening', 'menu', 'ability', 'play', 'Be', 'very', 'clear', 'review', 'blu-ray', 'version', ""'ve"", 'returned', 'blu-ray', 'disc', 'have', 'ordered', 'DVD.Update', '8/19/2013', 'Apparently', 'blu-ray', 'DVD', 'are', 'old', 'style', '4:3', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'PCM', 'sound', 'Lacking', 'HD', 'sound', '5.1', 'surround', 'wide-screen', 'So', 'even', 'can', 'get', 'blu-ray', 'benefit', 'buying', 'Thanks', 'clarification', 'other', 'reviewers', 'who', 'have', 'commented', 'Nonetheless', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'given', 'principals', 'direction', 'settings', 'So', 'worth', 'having', 'Just', 'not', 'technically', 'what', 'had', 'hoped']",Tosca: Live in Rome
1642956,A27NF4LTAUZ8ZD,B00C70FFUG,ZS,"[5, 5]","I purchased the Blu-Ray and as mentioned by others it is 4:3 and PCM but fortunately my plasma has an option to adjust the picture size (p-size button) to a wider setting so you can get rid of the black bars altogether.  I also have a Bose so that took care of the PCM for me.  Even if you do not have those features it is still worth purchasing just to hear the gorgeous voices and acting by all in their prime.  The setting is lovely.  The picture on the Blu-Ray admittedly is not Blu-Ray 2013 quality since it was recorded with older equipment but 99% of the time it is perfect.  Occasionally the sun streams into the church so there is a ""slight"" haze but I found the picture quality to be very good.
