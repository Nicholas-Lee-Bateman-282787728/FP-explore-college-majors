It can be slow, so be prepared.  But generally, I appreciate a film that gives the view more to feel by watching the characters, experiencing emotions, etc.Family dynamics is the theme, where the adult family members come to the home of the aging parents for a reunion, and dinner to commemorate the life of the eldest son who died 15 years ago.  There is tension with the father, an ex-physician, and the remaining son who feels he never measured up to his brother, and feels not fully accepted by his father.  The pace is very slow and don't expect any drama. It takes quite some time to get to the meat of the story.The film is written and directed by Hirokazu Kore-Eda, and my familiarity exists withNobody Knows, which I thought was a very good film with children abandoned by their mother, and fending for themselves in an apartment.  .....Rizzo",3,To understand is to appreciate families,1340409600,"06 23, 2012",2012,980,"['2008', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'especially', 'people', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'appreciate', 'family', 'films', 'family', 'values', 'family', 'dissension', 'can', 'be', 'slow', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'generally', 'appreciate', 'film', 'view', 'more', 'feel', 'watching', 'characters', 'experiencing', 'emotions', 'etc.Family', 'dynamics', 'theme', 'where', 'adult', 'family', 'members', 'come', 'home', 'aging', 'parents', 'reunion', 'dinner', 'commemorate', 'life', 'eldest', 'son', 'who', 'died', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'tension', 'father', 'ex-physician', 'remaining', 'son', 'who', 'never', 'measured', 'up', 'brother', 'feels', 'not', 'fully', 'accepted', 'father', 'pace', 'very', 'slow', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'drama', 'quite', 'time', 'get', 'meat', 'story.The', 'film', 'written', 'directed', 'Hirokazu', 'Kore-Eda', 'familiarity', 'withNobody', 'Knows', 'thought', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'children', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'fending', 'apartment', '..Rizzo']",Still Walking
1396131,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B004CGUBZW,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","There are some films that say a whole lot while remaining, for the most part, silent.  `Still Walking' is one of those films, for it remains quiet throughout, exploring subtlety as a key plot devise in order to hit us where it counts in moments we don't see coming.  In fact, about halfway through I was becoming almost inpatient in my wonderment as to where exactly this film was going, but when it gets there it GETS THERE.  I think that is much of the beauty in `Still Walking'.  It doesn't come out and say anything and yet when the film concludes you are left with so much to ponder that the eventual conclusions drawn are deeper and more fulfilling than if the film had made it a point to beat us over the head with `their' observations.`Still Walking' takes place over a single weekend where a family gets together to mourn the anniversary of the death of the Yokoyama's eldest son.  The parents are obviously consumed with the deepest grief, twelve years after the accident, and their remaining children (they have a surviving son and daughter) are left to pick up the pieces.  Their daughter seems ready to move right in with her family and take over, in a seemingly selfish and possibly self-gratifying way, but their son, Ryota, seems almost repulsed by his parents.  Having married a widow (who has a young son), his marriage isn't necessarily accepted by his parents and he feels distanced from them and their constant cleaving to memories better left alone.  Over the course of lunch and dinner and conversations, the Yokoyama family secrets are revealed with such touching detail that one is completely consumed with the storytelling and the development.And MY GOD does Kirin Kiki deliver one of the finest performances I've seen in a long time.  The way she handles her two big scenes (her confession of her pain and the butterfly scene) are so heartbreaking and sincere.  It's a powerhouse performance that underscores each emotion with that needed touch of authenticity.  The rest of the cast, especially Yoshio Harada, are also on the top of their games here.With vivid writing that reaches the soul and acute attention to detail, `Still Walking' is still moving, time after time after time.",5,A breath of fresh air...,1344384000,"08 8, 2012",2012,2210,"['are', 'films', 'say', 'whole', 'lot', 'remaining', 'most', 'part', 'silent', 'Still', 'Walking', 'one', 'films', 'quiet', 'exploring', 'subtlety', 'key', 'plot', 'devise', 'order', 'hit', 'where', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'fact', 'halfway', 'was', 'becoming', 'almost', 'inpatient', 'wonderment', 'where', 'exactly', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'GETS', 'THERE', 'think', 'much', 'beauty', 'Still', 'Walking', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'say', 'anything', 'yet', 'when', 'film', 'are', 'left', 'so', 'much', 'ponder', 'eventual', 'conclusions', 'drawn', 'are', 'deeper', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'film', 'had', 'made', 'point', 'beat', 'head', 'observations.', 'Still', 'Walking', 'place', 'single', 'weekend', 'where', 'family', 'together', 'mourn', 'anniversary', 'death', 'Yokoyama', 'eldest', 'son', 'parents', 'are', 'obviously', 'consumed', 'deepest', 'grief', 'twelve', 'years', 'accident', 'remaining', 'children', 'have', 'surviving', 'son', 'daughter', 'are', 'left', 'pick', 'up', 'pieces', 'daughter', 'ready', 'move', 'right', 'family', 'take', 'over', 'seemingly', 'selfish', 'possibly', 'self-gratifying', 'way', 'son', 'Ryota', 'almost', 'repulsed', 'parents', 'Having', 'married', 'widow', 'who', 'young', 'son', 'marriage', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'accepted', 'parents', 'distanced', 'constant', 'cleaving', 'memories', 'better', 'left', 'alone', 'course', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'conversations', 'Yokoyama', 'family', 'secrets', 'are', 'revealed', 'such', 'touching', 'detail', 'one', 'completely', 'consumed', 'storytelling', 'development.And', 'MY', 'GOD', 'Kirin', 'Kiki', 'deliver', 'one', 'finest', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time', 'way', 'two', 'big', 'scenes', 'confession', 'pain', 'butterfly', 'scene', 'are', 'so', 'heartbreaking', 'sincere', 'powerhouse', 'performance', 'emotion', 'needed', 'touch', 'authenticity', 'rest', 'cast', 'especially', 'Yoshio', 'Harada', 'are', 'also', 'top', 'games', 'here.With', 'vivid', 'writing', 'soul', 'acute', 'attention', 'detail', 'Still', 'Walking', 'still', 'moving', 'time', 'time', 'time']",Still Walking

1396133,A30JPZ9TZ7I61U,B004CGUBZW,"Christopher Barrett ""Evil Corgi""","[0, 0]","This film reminded my quite a bit of the films of Yasujiro Ozu.  Recipe?  Take a typical seeming Japanese family, introduce a little oddity (in this film the son marrying the widow is the little oddity - at least to his parents), and have a recent or upcoming death in the family.  Don't dwell on too much dialogue and shoot beautiful settings, mostly indoors.  This is the trademarked Ozu recipe for success.  And Kore-Eda does an admirable job.Also of note: there are some terrific special features and a wonderful book included in the Criterion release.  The interview with Kore-Eda is eye opening and you can really gain a sense of understanding about his personality and this film in general, which is slightly autobiographical.There is nothing to really 'spoil' about this film.  It is stately paced and takes place over the two days that the elderly parents have their two children and their spouses and the grandchildren over.  They are reminiscing about the death of the eldest son (a kind of tradition in Japan - to celebrate the life of and remember the death of loved ones on the anniversary of their death).  Though we never really hear what had happened to the son, we know that the parents blame one of his friends.  Through this and other little flashes, we find out that the elderly parents are actually quite hateful and vindictive in small doses.  They constantly bicker with one another and continue to question their younger son's marriage to the widow.In his interview, Kore-Eda said that the mother 'spews venom', and it's true, though in small flashes.  It's interesting, and she has the most complex character.  The other actors are all very good, though the daughter has a rather annoying voice at times.In contrast to Ozu's films however, this film never really touches on the strong bond one family member has for another.  The only real bond we see is the son and the widow and her son (Ryo and his immediate family).  It is strange because this is the relationship continually questioned by the other family members.  But Ozu consistently shows the elderly parents as loving and peaceful in their old age, often despite being stubborn or even mean when they were younger parents.  The viewer is then sad at the elderly persons' lives and emptiness.  But in this film we never really sympathize with them.There is also the lack of a strong, young female role.  The actress who plays the widow is very good, but she is no Setsuka Hara.  And the grandfather is to Chishu Ryu.  Nonetheless it is a very good modern Japanese film built in the tradition of classic, quiet, and poignant films.  Well worth viewing if you are an Ozu fan, or if you don't mind enjoying films that are quiet, stately, and don't really have true resolution.  It's a slice of life drama, and one that is wonderfully crafted and worthy of a Criterion release.  The only reason I gave four stars is that it just doesn't really resound like many complex family dramas from Japan in the past and present.  For a modern Japanese film that I felt was another great family drama check outMan Walking on Snow.",4,Is Kore-eda the reincarnated Yasujiro Ozu?,1323734400,"12 13, 2011",2011,3102,"['film', 'reminded', 'quite', 'bit', 'films', 'Yasujiro', 'Ozu', 'Recipe', 'Take', 'typical', 'seeming', 'Japanese', 'family', 'introduce', 'little', 'oddity', 'film', 'son', 'marrying', 'widow', 'little', 'oddity', 'least', 'parents', 'have', 'recent', 'upcoming', 'death', 'family', 'Do', ""n't"", 'dwell', 'too', 'much', 'dialogue', 'shoot', 'beautiful', 'settings', 'mostly', 'indoors', 'trademarked', 'Ozu', 'recipe', 'success', 'Kore-Eda', 'admirable', 'job.Also', 'note', 'are', 'terrific', 'special', 'features', 'wonderful', 'book', 'included', 'Criterion', 'release', 'interview', 'Kore-Eda', 'eye', 'opening', 'can', 'really', 'gain', 'sense', 'understanding', 'personality', 'film', 'general', 'slightly', 'autobiographical.There', 'nothing', 'really', ""'spoil"", 'film', 'stately', 'paced', 'place', 'two', 'days', 'elderly', 'parents', 'have', 'two', 'children', 'spouses', 'grandchildren', 'are', 'reminiscing', 'death', 'eldest', 'son', 'kind', 'tradition', 'Japan', 'celebrate', 'life', 'remember', 'death', 'loved', 'ones', 'anniversary', 'death', 'never', 'really', 'hear', 'what', 'had', 'happened', 'son', 'know', 'parents', 'blame', 'one', 'friends', 'other', 'little', 'flashes', 'find', 'out', 'elderly', 'parents', 'are', 'actually', 'quite', 'hateful', 'vindictive', 'small', 'doses', 'constantly', 'bicker', 'one', 'continue', 'question', 'younger', 'son', 'marriage', 'widow.In', 'interview', 'Kore-Eda', 'said', 'mother', 'venom', 'true', 'small', 'flashes', 'interesting', 'most', 'complex', 'character', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'daughter', 'rather', 'annoying', 'voice', 'times.In', 'contrast', 'Ozu', 'films', 'however', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'touches', 'strong', 'bond', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'only', 'real', 'bond', 'see', 'son', 'widow', 'son', 'Ryo', 'immediate', 'family', 'strange', 'relationship', 'continually', 'questioned', 'other', 'family', 'members', 'Ozu', 'consistently', 'elderly', 'parents', 'loving', 'peaceful', 'old', 'age', 'often', 'being', 'stubborn', 'even', 'mean', 'when', 'were', 'younger', 'parents', 'viewer', 'then', 'sad', 'elderly', 'persons', 'lives', 'emptiness', 'film', 'never', 'really', 'sympathize', 'them.There', 'also', 'lack', 'strong', 'young', 'female', 'role', 'actress', 'who', 'widow', 'very', 'good', 'Setsuka', 'Hara', 'grandfather', 'Chishu', 'Ryu', 'Nonetheless', 'very', 'good', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'film', 'built', 'tradition', 'classic', 'quiet', 'poignant', 'films', 'Well', 'viewing', 'are', 'Ozu', 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'enjoying', 'films', 'are', 'quiet', 'stately', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'true', 'resolution', 'slice', 'life', 'drama', 'one', 'wonderfully', 'crafted', 'worthy', 'Criterion', 'release', 'only', 'reason', 'gave', 'four', 'stars', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'resound', 'many', 'complex', 'family', 'dramas', 'Japan', 'past', 'present', 'modern', 'Japanese', 'film', 'felt', 'was', 'great', 'family', 'drama', 'check', 'outMan', 'Walking', 'Snow']",Still Walking

There's not a forced moment in the film, and it is not a tearjerker, even though it left my wife weeping, and me profoundly moved. This is because it is a deeply and genuinely affecting film. The closest film, in tone, that I can think of, in terms of American cinema, is Woody Allen's 1988 masterpiece, starring Gena Rowlands: Another Woman, wherein drama, on a grand scale, is achieved by focusing on people who do not live on such a scale. Still Walking is an example of cinemature in both senses of the term: mature filmmaking and literature-like in its depth and profundity.As for Still Walking?

Resembles a 'Rondo' musical structure.The story is told in a serene pace - mostly within the rooms of the house, only to be intercepted by some walking or driving shots in the Yokohama area. But we do not feel bore as it draws the viewer close to the family; it echos many of the feelings that we possess as well. As if we also become a visitor to the house for the day.Invariably it reminds Ozu - the subtle treatment, silent (and some static) shots of neighborhood, simple artifacts of house (plants, painting) and a very intimate study of human mind.

1396138,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B004CGUBZW,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[35, 35]","Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda has made some terrific, understated dramas.  Emotional, heartfelt, and real--Kore-eda's films capture true moments without ever descending into theatrics, melodrama, or false sentimentality.  His ""Nobody Knows,"" a decidedly bleak story of child abandonment, might have been a very different and over-the-top horror show had Kore-eda not nailed it with a quiet intensity and remarkable realism.  But as much as I admired ""Nobody Knows,"" and ""After Life"" for that matter, I think that my personal favorite is ""Still Walking.""  And I'm thrilled that this understated gem is getting the Criterion stamp so more people will experience this lovely film.  Perhaps the most realistic and intimate portrait of a family gathering ever put on film, ""Still Walking"" perfectly captures all the nuances that make families tick.  Tender, funny, frustrating--all the love and obligations that bring people together share space with the disappointments and misunderstandings that drive them apart.This is not a plot focused narrative, but rather a character driven sociological examination of a typical family unit.  Marking the anniversary of the death of their son, a elderly couple are joined by their other grown children for an annual ritual of respect.  Their daughter, with whom they share a close relationship, is on hand to assist in the preparations with her husband and two children.  But much of the event centers around the return of the other son (Ryota) accompanied by his new wife and stepson.  Ryota is a wayward soul who has lived in the shadow of his dead brother and he dreads these visits home.  Much of the movie takes place over cooking or over dining with shared jokes, reminiscences, and familial banter.  But even as the participants fall into their usual roles, they have evolved as well and must adopt to the subtle differences that the years bring.The terrific screenplay is so amazingly real--I truly felt as if I were eavesdropping on an actual family get-together.  Funny and thoughtful, ""Still Walking"" strikes a perfect balance.  Hiroshi Abe is spot-on as Ryota, perhaps the most demanding role.  Ryota's complicated relationship with his stubborn father provides the most intense drama.  But everyone is so good and believable here--from the sweet but scattered mother to the chatty accommodating sister to the peacemaker new wife.  It's a lovely ensemble.  I was thoroughly captivated by ""Still Walking.""  If I had one negative, and it's a slight one, the film misses a natural conclusion and adds a scene that (while sweet) seemed a beat too much.The film gets a new high def digital transfer as well as new interviews with Kore-eda and the director of photography.  There's also a ""making of"" featurette.  But, in an inspired bit of whimsy, recipes from the food in the film are included in the traditional Criterion essay booklet.

If only he could consciously act of that insight. This wonderful film has been throughly reviewed here by half a dozen others - all to excellent results. Still Walking is the only film I have seen by this director Hirokazu Kore-eda. From my research he has made 6 - 7 films all critically acclaimed with a heavy influence by Yasujiro Ozu. Which was apparent but only in small doses.After watching this film I'd say he has more in common with Edward Yang and the film Yi Yi as a modern day dysfunctional family going through what they believe to be the right motions only to arrive back at that moment where they started. Failing  to recognize the moment as the same one - the continuous circle of life and how little control we actually have making every action a potential for something wonderful however minute.

1396144,A3LGXZ1PSW7XV6,B004CGUBZW,"Shawn Palmquist ""I like stuff...""","[10, 11]","I really enjoyed this movie for what is was; a slice of ordinary life. This is a film whose story is told in the quiet moments of life, a film in which you must read in between the lines to fully understand. If you aren't in a contemplative mood it may be a little slow at times, but upon reflection the pace of the movie mirrors the type of family life being depicted perfectly.I will admit, for much of the film I found myself enjoying it...yet in the back of my mind, wishing for some sort of major conflict or plot point to spice things up. That being said, I don't think that would have been appropriate and would have cheapened the deeper story being softly told in the film. The theme which is related mostly to family, loss, and ageing is best told in the gracefully slow and meditative manner in which this film presents it. Again, I must make a point to recommend watching this movie when you are in a contemplative mood, as you will get much more out of it in that state.This is a perfect example of film as anti-escapism. Certain people watch movies to get their minds off of life...Hollywood blockbusters which focus more on special effects than character development are a perfect example of this. The idea is to 'shut off your mind and have a good time'...and there's nothing wrong with that. However, I find a film which speaks to the deeper issues in life infinitely more valuable.

1396145,A2P0Y85C896QIB,B004CGUBZW,Thomas Raven,"[0, 0]","Much like Lawrence Kasdan's The Big Chill, Still Walking is hard to describe in a single logline.  While it is a family drama that unfolds mostly during the anniversary of the death of the family's eldest son, that's a little like saying that the Big Chill takes place at a funeral.  It's really about the extended family dynamic, all the subtle ways in which the family unit is changing, and also the ways in which the family's values are being retained.  It's a complex film, but it is a joy to watch.I really felt like I was a fly on the wall of Grandma's house.  Writer-director Hirokazu Kareeda keeps the camera mostly static, allowing his actors to play out most scenes in long and medium shots, coming in for the close ups only when absolutely necessary.  He exhibits a deft touch that doesn't so much point us to his conclusions about the characters, but instead allows us to slowly accumulate impressions until we form our own conclusions.  Proof of his mastery is the fact that, in the end, I think my conclusions were exactly the ones he wanted me to have.Every performance here is pitch perfect.  I have to wonder how close these actors were to the characters they were portraying.  There's very little ""acting"" seen onscreen here.  I hesitate to single any one member of the cast out as they all deserve accolades as an efficient and convincing ensemble.Settings are realistic and efficient but they're also thrilling to see as an outsider of Japanese culture.  I felt like I was getting a real look into the lives of regular Japanese people -- something rarely seen in Japanese cinema outside that country.  As such, I also got the feeling that our differences really amount to the trappings and not so much to the people.  If there is an ultimate message here, I think it's that people will be people, regardless of their generations, countries, jobs, or economic statuses.If there is any fault to be given the picture, it's that it's a little bit difficult to get into at first.  Kareeda doesn't feel the need to give us all the information about everyone up front, so at first it can feel a little like eavesdropping on a family argument at the next table over.  But I was amazed by how I felt like I knew these people intimately by the time the movie was over.  I think that's due to the fact that we're given tiny bits and pieces along the way in much the same way we get to know our real world friends and family.  As soon as it was over, I felt compelled to go back and watch the movie again.  I was amazed by just how much more I liked the beginning of the film on the second viewing after I'd really ""met"" the characters.",5,A Beautiful Family Portrait,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",2012,2644,"['Much', 'Lawrence', 'Kasdan', 'Big', 'Chill', 'Still', 'Walking', 'hard', 'describe', 'single', 'logline', 'family', 'drama', 'mostly', 'anniversary', 'death', 'family', 'eldest', 'son', 'little', 'saying', 'Big', 'Chill', 'place', 'funeral', 'really', 'extended', 'family', 'dynamic', 'subtle', 'ways', 'family', 'unit', 'changing', 'also', 'ways', 'family', 'values', 'are', 'being', 'retained', 'complex', 'film', 'joy', 'watch.I', 'really', 'felt', 'was', 'fly', 'wall', 'Grandma', 'house', 'Writer-director', 'Hirokazu', 'Kareeda', 'camera', 'mostly', 'static', 'allowing', 'actors', 'play', 'out', 'most', 'scenes', 'long', 'medium', 'shots', 'coming', 'close', 'ups', 'only', 'when', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'deft', 'touch', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'point', 'conclusions', 'characters', 'instead', 'slowly', 'accumulate', 'impressions', 'form', 'own', 'conclusions', 'Proof', 'mastery', 'fact', 'end', 'think', 'conclusions', 'were', 'exactly', 'ones', 'wanted', 'have.Every', 'performance', 'here', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'have', 'wonder', 'how', 'close', 'actors', 'were', 'characters', 'were', 'portraying', 'very', 'little', 'acting', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'here', 'hesitate', 'single', 'one', 'member', 'cast', 'out', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'efficient', 'convincing', 'ensemble.Settings', 'are', 'realistic', 'efficient', ""'re"", 'also', 'thrilling', 'see', 'outsider', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'felt', 'was', 'getting', 'real', 'look', 'lives', 'regular', 'Japanese', 'people', 'something', 'rarely', 'seen', 'Japanese', 'cinema', 'country', 'such', 'also', 'got', 'feeling', 'differences', 'really', 'amount', 'trappings', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'people', 'ultimate', 'message', 'here', 'think', 'people', 'will', 'be', 'people', 'regardless', 'generations', 'countries', 'jobs', 'economic', 'statuses.If', 'fault', 'be', 'given', 'picture', 'little', 'bit', 'difficult', 'get', 'first', 'Kareeda', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'give', 'information', 'everyone', 'up', 'front', 'so', 'first', 'can', 'feel', 'little', 'eavesdropping', 'family', 'argument', 'next', 'table', 'was', 'amazed', 'how', 'felt', 'knew', 'people', 'intimately', 'time', 'movie', 'was', 'think', 'due', 'fact', ""'re"", 'given', 'tiny', 'bits', 'pieces', 'way', 'much', 'same', 'way', 'get', 'know', 'real', 'world', 'friends', 'family', 'As', 'soon', 'was', 'felt', 'compelled', 'go', 'back', 'watch', 'movie', 'again', 'was', 'amazed', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'liked', 'beginning', 'film', 'second', 'viewing', ""'d"", 'really', 'met', 'characters']",Still Walking
