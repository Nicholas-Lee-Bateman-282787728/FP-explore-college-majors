It is a hysterical Richard Dreyfuss comedy with an outstanding cast for a character study.  It reminds me of movies from the 30's or 40's when many movies were planned around great character actors and their parts.  This is one of my favorite comedys.,5,I love Let It Ride.,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,329,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'watched', 'Lucky', 'Numbers', 'Let', 'Ride', 'truly', 'rated', 'movie', 'hysterical', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'comedy', 'outstanding', 'cast', 'character', 'study', 'movies', '30', '40', 'when', 'many', 'movies', 'were', 'planned', 'great', 'character', 'actors', 'parts', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedys']",Lucky Numbers / Let It Ride

1156804,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B0017CW5T4,David Baldwin,"[1, 2]","Somebody at Paramount is truly inspired in paring these two films together.  A couple months back I bought ""Back to the Beach"" and ""Brain Candy"" on a single disc and that was as inspired as this double feature.  I went looking for ""Let It Ride"" as a solo and I got ""Lucky Numbers"" as a bonus.  I saw ""Let It Ride"" on cable years ago because I'm a huge David Johansen fan and it stayed with me.  Both films have something of a checkered past.  ""Let It Ride"" was released in the waning days of the Summer of '89 and was met with critical and commercial indifference.  ""Lucky Numbers"" met a similar fate being released the same weekend as ""Meet the Parents"".  John Travolta was kind of on the outs at that time having foisted ""Battlefield Earth"" on an unsuspecting public in early 2000.  What took me by surprise was that the film was directed by Nora Ephron.  There's virtually none of the schmaltz of ""Sleepless In Seattle"" apparent here.  The film seems inspired by Elmore Leonard by way of Quentin Tarantino.  What distinguishes the film is not so much plot but mood and characterization.  On paper these characters are not that sympathetic but Ephron has assembled a talented cast, stars Travolta and Lisa Kudrow no exception, that imbue enough humanity to make them palatable.  I particularly liked Tim Roth as a sleazy club owner and Bill Pullman as a lazy cop.  ""Let It Ride"" stylistically is the polar opposite of ""Lucky Numbers"".  It's a genteel fable about a poor schmuck(Richard Dreyfuss) who's having a great day at the racetrack.  Director Joe Pytka has a great eye for detail and creating atmosphere.  I've never been to the track though I used to work minutes away from one but this film makes a day at the races very inviting.  Pytka also assembles a terrific ensemble that not only includes the aforementioned Johansen, but Teri Garr, Jennifer Tilly, Allen Garfield, Michelle Philips, and Robbie Coltrane.  One begins to wonder what other terrific double-bills Paramount has in it's vaults.  Just this morning I stumbled across a two-flick set of ""Brain Donors"" and ""Critical Condition"" with Richard Pryor!",5,It's A Photo Finish As To Which Flick Is Better,1301184000,"03 27, 2011",2011,2121,"['Somebody', 'Paramount', 'truly', 'inspired', 'paring', 'two', 'films', 'together', 'couple', 'months', 'back', 'bought', 'Back', 'Beach', 'Brain', 'Candy', 'single', 'disc', 'was', 'as', 'inspired', 'double', 'feature', 'went', 'looking', 'Let', 'Ride', 'solo', 'got', 'Lucky', 'Numbers', 'bonus', 'saw', 'Let', 'Ride', 'cable', 'years', 'ago', ""'m"", 'huge', 'David', 'Johansen', 'fan', 'stayed', 'films', 'have', 'something', 'checkered', 'past', 'Let', 'Ride', 'was', 'released', 'waning', 'days', 'Summer', ""'89"", 'was', 'met', 'critical', 'commercial', 'indifference', 'Lucky', 'Numbers', 'met', 'similar', 'fate', 'being', 'released', 'same', 'weekend', 'Meet', 'Parents', 'John', 'Travolta', 'was', 'kind', 'outs', 'time', 'having', 'foisted', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'unsuspecting', 'public', 'early', '2000', 'What', 'took', 'surprise', 'was', 'film', 'was', 'directed', 'Nora', 'Ephron', 'virtually', 'none', 'schmaltz', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'apparent', 'here', 'film', 'inspired', 'Elmore', 'Leonard', 'way', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'What', 'film', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'plot', 'mood', 'characterization', 'paper', 'characters', 'are', 'not', 'sympathetic', 'Ephron', 'assembled', 'talented', 'cast', 'Travolta', 'Lisa', 'Kudrow', 'exception', 'imbue', 'enough', 'humanity', 'make', 'palatable', 'particularly', 'liked', 'Tim', 'Roth', 'sleazy', 'club', 'owner', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'lazy', 'cop', 'Let', 'Ride', 'stylistically', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Lucky', 'Numbers', 'genteel', 'fable', 'poor', 'schmuck', 'Richard', 'Dreyfuss', 'who', 'having', 'great', 'day', 'racetrack', 'Director', 'Joe', 'Pytka', 'great', 'eye', 'detail', 'creating', 'atmosphere', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'track', 'used', 'work', 'minutes', 'away', 'one', 'film', 'day', 'races', 'very', 'inviting', 'Pytka', 'also', 'terrific', 'ensemble', 'not', 'only', 'aforementioned', 'Johansen', 'Teri', 'Garr', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'Allen', 'Garfield', 'Michelle', 'Philips', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'One', 'wonder', 'what', 'other', 'terrific', 'double-bills', 'Paramount', 'vaults', 'Just', 'morning', 'stumbled', 'two-flick', 'set', 'Brain', 'Donors', 'Critical', 'Condition', 'Richard', 'Pryor']",Lucky Numbers / Let It Ride
