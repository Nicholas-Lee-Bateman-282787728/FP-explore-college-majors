Having some knowledge of music theory (of which Gatton claimed he was totally ignorant) will help tremendously. For example, the very first lesson on this DVD (""two-note wonder"" chords) is an absolute treasure-trove of musical information (in spite of its simplicity) IF you take the time to study it to find out why these chords work the way they do (and if you do so, you will not only learn a lot about comping, but you'll also realize how to incorporate this concept into your lead playing, commonly known as ""double-stop"" playing). In other words, instead of seeing these lessons as ends in-and-of-themselves, try to look for the underlying concepts involved, and you'll get a lot more out of this DVD. A careful study of the accompanying text helps a lot. In fact, there may be some value in studying the text first, and then watching Gatton demonstrate the technique. At any rate, a word of warning: the accompanying booklet transcribes these lessons in both standard musical notation as well as tablature; the standard notation appears to be correct throughout, but I found a number of errors in the tablature. Any guitarist who can only read tab is going to get seriously messed up and wonder why the hell things don't sound right. The publisher has done a disservice to the student by not proofreading more carefully.",4,"Well-worth it, but...",1232236800,"01 18, 2009",2009,1759,"['are', 'couple', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'aware', 'Danny', 'Gatton', 'DVD/booklet', 'Danny', 'Gatton', 'was', 'course', 'amazing', 'guitarist', 'NOT', 'very', 'good', 'teacher', 'freely', 'instructional', 'DVDs', 'WHAT', 'do', 'HOW', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'EXPLAIN', 'incumbent', 'student', 'approach', 'lessons', 'thoughtfully', 'analytically', 'order', 'get', 'most', 'Having', 'knowledge', 'music', 'theory', 'Gatton', 'claimed', 'was', 'totally', 'ignorant', 'will', 'help', 'tremendously', 'example', 'very', 'first', 'lesson', 'DVD', 'two-note', 'wonder', 'chords', 'absolute', 'treasure-trove', 'musical', 'information', 'spite', 'simplicity', 'take', 'time', 'study', 'find', 'out', 'why', 'chords', 'work', 'way', 'do', 'do', 'so', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'learn', 'lot', 'comping', ""'ll"", 'also', 'realize', 'how', 'incorporate', 'concept', 'lead', 'playing', 'commonly', 'known', 'double-stop', 'playing', 'other', 'words', 'instead', 'seeing', 'lessons', 'ends', 'in-and-of-themselves', 'try', 'look', 'underlying', 'concepts', 'involved', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lot', 'more', 'DVD', 'careful', 'study', 'accompanying', 'text', 'lot', 'fact', 'may', 'be', 'value', 'studying', 'text', 'first', 'then', 'watching', 'Gatton', 'demonstrate', 'technique', 'rate', 'word', 'warning', 'accompanying', 'booklet', 'lessons', 'standard', 'musical', 'notation', 'as', 'well', 'tablature', 'standard', 'notation', 'be', 'correct', 'found', 'number', 'errors', 'tablature', 'Any', 'guitarist', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'read', 'tab', 'going', 'get', 'seriously', 'messed', 'up', 'wonder', 'why', 'hell', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'sound', 'right', 'publisher', 'done', 'disservice', 'student', 'not', 'proofreading', 'more', 'carefully']",Danny Gatton: Strictly Rhythm Guitar

Unless you have mastered chord theory, and music theory, or you have a natural ear for pitch you will be in way over your head. It is not really instructional but more of a demonstration. Like many of the ""hot licks"" dvd's its not really structured learning, more of a musician demonstrating some licks. But Gatten moves too fast and is very disorganized.

Also plays rhythms and melodies at the same time.  When he has another player doing lead on his Tele, they are phenomenal. My only hesitation in recommending this is that there's not a lot of tab, and the camera doesn't focus closely enough  on his fingers at times, so it's a little hard for me in several places. On the other hand, his lesson on Chuck Berry riffs is worth the purchase. Of all the guitar dvd's I've  bought so far, I like Kenny Sultan and Ernie Hawkins the best.  Hawkins has actual film of Lightnin' Hopkins and Mance Lipscomb, then Ernie shows it step by step, and he's a very effective teacher.  I just ordered Warren Haynes and James Burton's dvd's, so don't know yet how they'll stack up.",4,"great player, a little hard to follow",1195084800,"11 15, 2007",2007,995,"['Gatton', 'was', 'great', 'player', 'seeing', 'dvd', 'how', 'much', 'skilled', 'player', 'can', 'do', 'simple', 'frills', 'guitar', 'Tele', 'Hammond', 'B-3', 'organ', 'power', 'chords', 'was', 'apparently', 'playing', 'Pete', 'Townsend', 'picked', 'up', 'guitar', 'Also', 'rhythms', 'melodies', 'same', 'time', 'When', 'player', 'doing', 'lead', 'Tele', 'are', 'phenomenal', 'only', 'hesitation', 'recommending', 'not', 'lot', 'tab', 'camera', ""n't"", 'focus', 'closely', 'enough', 'fingers', 'times', 'little', 'hard', 'several', 'places', 'other', 'hand', 'lesson', 'Chuck', 'Berry', 'riffs', 'purchase', 'guitar', 'dvd', ""'ve"", 'bought', 'so', 'far', 'like', 'Kenny', 'Sultan', 'Ernie', 'best', 'actual', 'film', 'Lightnin', 'Hopkins', 'Mance', 'Lipscomb', 'then', 'Ernie', 'step', 'step', 'very', 'effective', 'teacher', 'just', 'ordered', 'Warren', 'Haynes', 'James', 'Burton', 'dvd', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'yet', 'how', ""'ll"", 'stack', 'up']",Danny Gatton: Strictly Rhythm Guitar
