1299221,A26YQ9LOMVC7CK,B002YKD77C,"Dana Vincent ""dartfever""","[6, 8]","Red Canyon is a well-intentioned thriller that does present the viewer with an engaging plotline, plus quite a few twists in the allegiance of the main characters.  Even though the story is a blend from other films centered about backwoods and dysfunctional family misadventures, there is a definite momentum that is maintained by the numerous plot revelations.  Although the ending left something to be desired, the main factors keeping me from seeing this as a truly excellent movie were the cinematography and the editing.  Despite competent acting and mostly believable scene staging, too much of the movie had an unintentional amateur filmmaker feel to it.  Further, the editing was weak for this type of work, significantly diluting much of the shock value.  Not bad overall, and certainly worth a watch if you can find a reasonably-priced copy!",3,"Good, but should have been better!",1275609600,"06 4, 2010",2010,851,"['Red', 'Canyon', 'well-intentioned', 'thriller', 'present', 'viewer', 'engaging', 'plotline', 'quite', 'few', 'twists', 'allegiance', 'main', 'characters', 'Even', 'story', 'blend', 'other', 'films', 'centered', 'backwoods', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'misadventures', 'definite', 'momentum', 'maintained', 'numerous', 'plot', 'revelations', 'ending', 'left', 'something', 'be', 'desired', 'main', 'factors', 'keeping', 'seeing', 'truly', 'excellent', 'movie', 'were', 'cinematography', 'editing', 'competent', 'acting', 'mostly', 'believable', 'scene', 'staging', 'too', 'much', 'movie', 'had', 'unintentional', 'amateur', 'filmmaker', 'feel', 'Further', 'editing', 'was', 'weak', 'type', 'work', 'significantly', 'diluting', 'much', 'shock', 'value', 'Not', 'bad', 'overall', 'certainly', 'watch', 'can', 'find', 'reasonably-priced', 'copy']",Red Canyon

The first 30 minutes of the movie are full of suspense, mystery, ominious scenery, and good acting. I was intrigued and wanted to learn about the bad guys and what transpired in the cave at the red canyon. Unfortunately, the rest of the story is told in brief blurry flashbacks which only serve to aggravate and further confuse the viewer. From what I could glean from the annoying flashbacks, the movie seems to end with a disturbing incestious twist but by that time I was too bored and annoyed to really care.",2,What the heck is going on?,1262995200,"01 9, 2010",2010,604,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'Red', 'Canyon', 'Well', 'confusing', 'mess', 'start', 'off', 'well', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'full', 'suspense', 'mystery', 'ominious', 'scenery', 'good', 'acting', 'was', 'intrigued', 'wanted', 'learn', 'bad', 'guys', 'what', 'transpired', 'cave', 'red', 'canyon', 'Unfortunately', 'rest', 'story', 'told', 'brief', 'blurry', 'flashbacks', 'only', 'serve', 'aggravate', 'further', 'confuse', 'viewer', 'what', 'could', 'glean', 'annoying', 'flashbacks', 'movie', 'end', 'disturbing', 'incestious', 'twist', 'time', 'was', 'too', 'bored', 'annoyed', 'really', 'care']",Red Canyon

This is a mess, no  wonder its never really been released and even the DVD is virtually impossible to buy anywhere apart from Amazon. (not necessarily a compliment guys)The gore and violence is laughably bad and the incestuous ending is deeply offensive and makes no sense at all.But none of the movie makes any sense. It also looks cheap and is poorly edited. Actors never really know how a movie is going to turn out, but did anyone read the script?

It's a twist you don't see coming and it's a sick twist with no resolution. At least give some resolution to something like that and give the poor girl who has been tortured for years a break already.",2,Horrible ending,1374624000,"07 24, 2013",2013,364,"['premise', 'movie', 'okay', 'heck', 'even', 'actors', 'are', 'good..okay', 'only', 'two', 'are', 'good', 'ending', 'really', 'movie', 'twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'sick', 'twist', 'resolution', 'least', 'give', 'resolution', 'something', 'give', 'poor', 'girl', 'who', 'been', 'tortured', 'years', 'break', 'already']",Red Canyon

(And if you can't figure out what it is from even that vague synopsis, then let me recommend you Laurie Halse Anderson's book &lt;em>Speak&lt;/em>, where most of us figured out the EXACT SAME TWIST from reading the jacket copy.)Even given that it's entirely predictable, it's not a total lost cause. Reedus plays a slimeball with aplomb, even when he's the good guy (viz. &lt;em>Boondock Saints&lt;/em>), and his performance here is chilling. Lakin is better when she's imitating Barbara from &lt;em>Night of the Living Dead&lt;/em>, but between her and Reedus, they almost pull the rest of the cast out of the crapper. Not quite, but almost.Sonnel Velazquez' cinematography is great when he's doing wide-open spaces, but he's got to work on the cramped cave shots. He's got a future in front of him, though.Not a complete waste of time. **",2,Not as awful as it could have been...,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,1521,"['lt', 'strong', '>', 'Red', 'Canyon', 'lt', '>', 'Giovanni', 'Rodriguez', '2008', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'plot', ""'re"", ""'ve"", 'even', 'seen', 'last', 'week', 'traumatized', 'young', 'thing', 'Regina', 'lt', '>', 'Hottie', 'Nottie', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Christine', 'Lakin', 'brought', 'brother', 'Devon', 'lt', '>', 'Swimming', 'Upstream', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'Tim', 'Draxl', 'back', 'family', 'homestead', 'can', 'sell', 'place', 'out', 'traumatic', 'event', 'made', 'Regina', 'go', 'bats', 'first', 'place', 'waiting', 'wings', 'something', 'do', 'Mac', 'lt', '>', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'lt', '>', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'local', 'meth', 'dealer', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'again', 'and/or', 'b', 'nuts', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'even', 'vague', 'synopsis', 'then', 'let', 'recommend', 'Laurie', 'Halse', 'Anderson', 'book', 'lt', '>', 'Speak', 'lt', '>', 'where', 'most', 'figured', 'out', 'EXACT', 'SAME', 'TWIST', 'reading', 'jacket', 'copy', 'Even', 'given', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'not', 'total', 'lost', 'cause', 'Reedus', 'slimeball', 'aplomb', 'even', 'when', 'good', 'guy', 'viz', 'lt', '>', 'Boondock', 'Saints', 'lt', '/em', '>', 'performance', 'here', 'chilling', 'Lakin', 'better', 'when', 'imitating', 'Barbara', 'lt', '>', 'Night', 'Living', 'Dead', 'lt', '>', 'Reedus', 'almost', 'pull', 'rest', 'cast', 'crapper', 'Not', 'quite', 'almost.Sonnel', 'Velazquez', 'cinematography', 'great', 'when', 'doing', 'wide-open', 'spaces', 'got', 'work', 'cramped', 'cave', 'shots', 'got', 'future', 'front', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', '**']",Red Canyon
1299226,A3FDKC3XBJK443,B002YKD77C,"Sara Gruenebaum ""BecauseReedus""","[0, 0]","This DVD is virtually impossible to find in the US and Canada but, I was able to wrangle a copy out of the UK and with the help of my brand new region free DVD player, I was finally able to watch it!The credits are still rolling after my first viewing of this movie and I'm somewhat at a loss for words... I tracked it down because I'm a huge fan of Norman Reedus and let me tell you, I'm not disappointed! He is absolutely phenomenal as Mac! Seriously, making a drug cooking rapist with meth teeth sexy, one murder at a time. Absolutely amazing. If you're a fan of Norman Reedus, this is definitely a must-see! Naturally, I wish Mac had a larger role but, that's just my own personal bias...As for the non-Norman aspects of the film, it was really creepy and disturbing. Like a tamed version of The Hills Have Eyes. And it definitely didn't have a happy ending. Personally, I like that in a movie. Too often you see the hero defeat the bad guy and save the girl and all is well, wrapped up nice and neat with a little bow right before the credits roll. It's a nice change of pace when a movie leaves you with your head spinning, your heart breaking and your jaw on the floor.",5,Definitely worth the effort to track down this film!,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",2013,1176,"['DVD', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'find', 'US', 'Canada', 'was', 'able', 'wrangle', 'copy', 'UK', 'help', 'brand', 'new', 'region', 'free', 'DVD', 'player', 'was', 'finally', 'able', 'watch', 'credits', 'are', 'still', 'rolling', 'first', 'viewing', 'movie', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'loss', 'words', 'tracked', 'down', ""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'let', 'tell', ""'m"", 'not', 'disappointed', 'absolutely', 'phenomenal', 'Mac', 'Seriously', 'making', 'drug', 'cooking', 'rapist', 'meth', 'teeth', 'sexy', 'one', 'murder', 'time', 'Absolutely', 'amazing', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Norman', 'Reedus', 'definitely', 'must-see', 'Naturally', 'wish', 'Mac', 'had', 'larger', 'role', 'just', 'own', 'personal', 'bias', 'non-Norman', 'aspects', 'film', 'was', 'really', 'creepy', 'disturbing', 'tamed', 'version', 'Hills', 'Have', 'Eyes', 'definitely', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'happy', 'ending', 'Personally', 'like', 'movie', 'Too', 'often', 'see', 'hero', 'defeat', 'bad', 'guy', 'save', 'girl', 'well', 'wrapped', 'up', 'nice', 'neat', 'little', 'bow', 'right', 'credits', 'roll', 'nice', 'change', 'pace', 'when', 'movie', 'head', 'spinning', 'heart', 'breaking', 'jaw', 'floor']",Red Canyon
