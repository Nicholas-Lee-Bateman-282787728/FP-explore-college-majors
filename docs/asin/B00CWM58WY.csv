1651418,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B00CWM58WY,Ace Reader,"[2, 3]","Blue Sky Studios new fantasy comedy tale ""Epic"" is a (""shiny candy coating with a soft creamy center""), perfect family film for parents and children alike to enjoy together keeping both parties thoroughly entertained. It's enchanting story line is fast paced with nary a dull moment. I myself laughed a lot at the dialog and characters in this funny and delightful film. The characters are well written and defined leaving no question who the good guys and the bad guys are.It's screenplay is based on the book ""The Leaf Men and The Brave Good Bugs"" by William Joyce. Joyce also co-wrote this screenplay along with this films director Chris Wedge, who also just happens to be the voice actor of that well loved, nut chasing crazy squirrel Scrat from the ""Ice Age"" films. Chris Wedge, William Joyce along with James V. Hart, Daniel Shere, Tom J. Astle, and Mat Ember all together wrote this films imaginative  screenplay. They did a great job creating an imaginative story about a world that reminds us of how precious our forests are without shoving the message down our throats. They have created a perfect balance with this films fantasy tale about tiny people who populate a forest near a humans home. It reminded me of the Australian-American made 1992 animated film ""FernGully: The Last Rainforest.""Human teenager Mary Katherine (voiced by Pennsylvania born Amanda Seyfried recently seen in 2012 ""Les Miserables""), has come home to live with her Dad after her Mom has past away. She finds her Dad is obsessed with the crazy belief that tiny men live in the forest surrounding their home. He has even set up cameras in the forest to record proof of their existence so he can prove to the world he's not crazy. Chasing after her three legged dog (this dog is hilarious), into the forest surrounding her home, M. K. is magically reduced in size (small enough to ride Humming Birds!), and becomes involved with the Leaf Men when their Queen is wounded in a skirmish with the villain of this story Mandrake and his minions. M. K. is now in the world of the Leaf Men. A world she never dreamed existed where she is now directly involved in a battle between the forces of good and evil. Together they must save their world which will save ours.Mandrake is the villainous leader of the bad guys (voiced by Academy Award winning Austrian actor Christoph Waltz recently seen in 2012 ""Django Unchained""). He wants to destroy the forest for his own evil purposes. Irish actor Colin Farrell (recently seen in 2012 ""Total Recall""), is the voice of the serious fearless leader of the Leaf Men Ronin who leads the battle to save the forest. Kentucky born Josh Hutcherson (recently seen in 2012 ""The Hunger Games""), voices the chivalrous but headstrong Nod who helps M. K. through his world, and actress/singing superstar, Texas born Boyonce Knowles voices Tara, Queen of the forest.The computer animation in ""Epic"" is lushly rendered and beautiful to behold. That matched with an entertaining, exciting story line with heart and soul added for good measure and you have a magical film for the whole family. ""Epic"" closes with a feeling that there may be more stories to come in the future. I for one hope so. I highly recommend this enjoyable animated film.

Really.  If he is this absent-minded and accident prone, how did he build all of his elaborate equipment, mount everything all over the woods by himself, etc.  His disconnect is too extreme to make his hard work and dedication plausible.  Also, while so much of the film was beyond detailed and beautiful to look at -  the film is made even weaker because while some of the warriors are incredibly ornate and detailed - or the slug & snail for that matter - conversely, the Queen (Beyonce) and the Judas-figure (Pitbull as a Bullfrog) - almost look like they were drawn at the last minute to match a celebrity voice and are very 2-dimensional.  The music mostly disappears in this film - which isn't a bad thing.  And except for a momentary burst into an unnecessary musical moment that fizzles out quickly (thankfully) - there's nothing in the soundtrack worth holding onto (surprising for Danny Elfman).  Some things that stood out: the concept of visibility based on a creatures wavelength/speed of existence was very clever and handled nicely throughout; the life/death battle for balance in the forest and that critters/characters could face and actual demise; and some decent song snippets (The Weepies 'Same Changes').

Fox hasn't had a very good track record with animation, so this move really had me worried &#8211; that is until now. 'EPIC' isn't Pixar or DreamWorks quality, but it's a step in the right direction and a much stronger effort than other Fox-distributed movies.Mary Katherine [Amanda Seyfried], known as M.K., is in a hard period in her life. The movie opens shortly after her mother's funeral. Not quite old enough to be on her own, she's moving in with her father [Jason Sudeikis], who she hasn't seen in years. M.K.'s parents divorced long ago, a major source of the marital problems being her dad's obsession with his scientific work. Sadly, nothing has changed. He still places 100 percent of his efforts in proving that tiny people exist within the forest. He believes that these small people, known as Leafmen, serve as the guardians of nature. Of course, we quickly learn that he's correct, that the Leafmen are in a constant battle against equally tiny bad guys called Boggins who promote rot and decay.Shortly after M.K. arrives at her father's home, the lore of the forest is explained to us. You see, forests have always thrived because a powerful fairy queen [Beyonc&eacute;] carries &#34;the spirit of the forest.&#34; Every so many years, she passes that spirit along to another being. The day that M.K. arrives just-so-happens to be the day that the queen is going to pass along the spirit. As the Leafmen assist the queen, the Boggin army attacks and thwarts their plans, trying to steal the spirit of life and corrupting it with rot. As M.K. wanders through the forest, she stumbles upon the queen and gets pulled into their world &#8211; shrunken down and everything. With the help of the head of the Leafmen (Colin Farrell) and a cute young Leafmen soldier [Josh Hutcherson], M.K. must restore a healthy balance to the forest and put a stop to the Boggins' decay before it can destroy the entire forest.There are plenty of wordy serious moments, but they're intermingled with good fun. Just to keep the kids entertained, there are even silly childish moments &#8211; especially those with the slug and snail [Aziz Ansari and Chris O'Dowd]. A good amount of comedy is infused for the parental audiences. Here's to hoping that this upward trend of light-heartedness and humour continues and that DreamWorks has a positive influence on Fox.Although the script is a bit hit and miss, at least the voice cast carries the film right along. The surprise performance comes from Josh Hutcherson. Rather boring in his live-action roles, his vocal performance in 'Epic' is easily the best thing that he's done yet. Seyfried, Beyonc&eacute;, Ansari and O'Dowd are solid. Farrell is very good. And a few other surprise performances come from Steven Tyler and Christoph Waltz. Of course, Waltz's unmistakable voice is lent to the villainous head Boggin. This year has been loaded with lots of animated family flicks, but none of them have been amazing. But to me 'EPIC' is one of the year's better 3D animation film.Blu-ray Video Quality &#8211; 20th Century Fox has given the 3D Blu-ray a three-disc and five-format release. Fox has given 'EPIC' an absolutely flawless 3D 1080p awesome encoded image in a 2.40:1 aspect ratio. Animation is always the best format for 3D Blu-rays and 'Epic' is no exception and looks even more stunning, than when I saw this 3D release in the cinema.'EPIC' doesn't use gimmicky 3D of forcing images off the screen &#8211; which is rare for a children&#8217;s 3D film. Instead, it pushes the world of the film deep beyond the face of the television, as if the borders of the screen are the framing of a window. The world created is visually appealing, appearing like the images of fantasies in the mind of a child. Taking place in large settings, there are layers upon layers of material that extend the picture far into the background. From dust particles floating through the foreground to the blowing trees of the background, the distance between the two is an infinite playing field for the action of the film. There is never a lack of depth. The filmmakers ensured that objects are constantly placed in all areas of this setting. While some movies make you forget that you're watching a 3D movie, with 'Epic,' the amazing environments are subconscious reminders.I appreciate the amount of detail that 'EPIC' was given. The lighting of the forest gives the picture a warm and glowing softness that carries a stark contrast with the lifeless world of the Boggins. No matter which of the two settings we're in, fine details are visible. Be it hairs on a bee's body, leafy patterns, rough bark or oily bird feathers, textures and fine features can always be seen.The animation is so strong that it leaves no room for banding or aliasing. Colours are so vibrant that when we see the grey result of the Boggins' decay, the gravity of their rot carries a strong emphasis. Black levels are deep and rich without removing the fantastic fine details. After watching the film twice &#8211; once in 3D and once in 2D &#8211; I cannot find a single fault with the impressive picture quality.Blu-ray Audio Quality &#8211; love that more and more studios are starting to go with 7.1 audio. Fox has given 'EPIC' the 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio treatments. Just as much love was put into the audio mix as the video quality.From the very opening scene, the amazing dynamics of the audio mix become evident. Set mostly in forests, environmental sounds of cicadas, birds and bugs are layered throughout the channels. The sounds of a breeze blowing through leaves of a tree create an imaging effect that allows you to follow the direction of the wind. Other sounds, such as soaring arrows or passing bats and birds, also show off the strength of imaging. All speakers are constantly lit up with these great examples of environmental effects mixing.The vocal tracks are absolutely clean and clear. Large crowd scenes offer background banter that emits from all channels. Music also plays perfectly. Be it Steven Tyler's in-movie song, Beyonc&eacute; Knowles's closing credits track or Danny Elfman's score, the music is a great-sounding spacer-filler.Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:Please note that all special features are contained on the 2D Blu-ray disc &#8211; but aside from the &#34;Sneak Peeks&#34; they're all HD exclusives.Birds, Bugs and Slugs: Forest Explorer [5:21] Serving as a miniature nature documentary, this feature briefly teaches children about some of the real life creatures and plants featured in 'Epic.'Rot Rocks [3:18] The villainous threat in 'EPIC' is decay, but this documentary explains how the act of rotting is a beneficial part of nature.Bugs of Camouflage [3:44] Take a look at some of nature&#8217;s very best bugs at blending in and surviving.The 'Epic' Life at 2 Inches [3:42] Here is a special feature made for adults! This brief video scientifically explains how the human body would function at a height of two inches. Who knows how factual this information is, but it's definitely interesting.Mysteries of Moonhaven Revealed [24:39] Broken into seven chapters and viewable as a &#34;play all&#34; feature. This feature dives into the making of the film. While the documentary supported the film's content, this one breaks down the film and how it came to be &#8211; the characters, the story, the animation, etc.Theatrical Trailer [2:12] Like the film, this film trailer is very well crafted.Sneak Peek [HD] Re-watch all of the pre-menu trailers from the 2D Blu-ray disc, as well as a commercial for Team Energy Star and the trailers for 'Turbo,' 'Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness' and 'Dragons: Riders of Berk.'Finally, because the trailers for 'EPIC' made it out to be a mish-mash of other family films, I literally expected nothing from it when I popped in the Blu-ray disc. Much to my surprise, I found it to be quite enjoyable and much better than the most of this summer's other family films and enjoyed it from beginning to end. The story of 'EPIC' isn't the most unique, but it also isn't without its creative charm. The 3D Blu-ray set includes every possible digital format of the film [3D BD, 2D BD, DVD, Digital Copy and Ultraviolet] and it also comes with extracurricular family entertainment. A packet containing two sets of easy-to-grow seeds is included, but I have no idea why they included this, as to me it was a wasted addition, but I suppose if you have a garden, then you will think it a good bonus. The flawless audio and video qualities of the 3D Blu-ray are just another reason this set is a worthy purchase. Most of the special features are directed towards mainly children, but there's a decent 25-minute making-of for the adults also. So all in all this is an amazing Blu-ray packaged and had a totally entertaining awesome experience and again the 3D was also totally awesome and made you feel you was in the actual forest and I am so proud it has been added to my Blu-ray Collection.

1651439,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00CWM58WY,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Conceptually, `Epic' isn't anything new.  In fact, it's been compared to `Fern Gully' and `Alice in Wonderland', and I'd even add `Avatar' to the list (the flying on birds aspect seemed very `familiar').  It has a visual impact from a mere surface viewpoint, but digging deeper presents us with a film that is less `epic' than I expected.I personally find it baffling that they would use such a title to describe this film.  The word epic carries such a connotation, such a weight with it.  People use it to describe something larger than life, something on a grand and opus scale.  When you use that word to describe your film (in something as direct as the title) you lead the audience to expect something more than most films can live up to.  It was an ill-advised move, and then again I'm struggling to come up with an alternate name that would have influenced ticket buyers.`Save the Pod!'The basic theme running through `Epic' is that of environmental awareness, except there is nothing tying the doomed environment to human mistakes and so it strips us of any real awareness.  The bad guys are not human beings but rather these strange amphibian looking bug things called Boggans.  These Boggans are led by the evil Mandrake who wants to destroy the forest but has been unable to because of Queen Tara and her mystical healing powers.  She is the Queen of the forest and has been able to balance out Mandrake's disease spreading ways.  Mandrake then decides to kill off the Queen before she can chose an heir, but his plan doesn't exactly go smoothly and he only gets it half right.  On the human side of things you have M.K., a young girl who just lost a mother and is forced to go live with her father who is a crazy man in the woods convinced of the little people in the trees and so he has cameras everywhere trying to get a glimpse of them.  M.K. obviously thinks her dad is crazy until Queen Tara shrinks her and gives her the heir to take care of; that heir being a pod that needs to bloom that very night.This film is fine (my kids loved it), but for what it promises I'm extremely letdown.  The visual aspect of the film (especially in 3D) is nice, but there is a lack of dreamlike serenity here.  Everything is so obvious and almost plain.  The tiny little worlds are just so unimpressive.  Yes, the use of flowers and nature to create the alternate world is pretty neat, but everything looks and feels so anticlimactic, so uneventful.

1651444,A3LTZGHZBBBQX0,B00CWM58WY,Anthony L.,"[5, 6]","Naming your very film ""Epic"" is a tall order. The word ""epic"" suggests sweeping scope, grand action, and impossible odds. But EPIC is about a race of little people 5 inches tall. It's highest stakes are the survival of a patch of forest and the size of a 16 year old girl. Is EPIC epic?No, not really. The scope is not all that grand, the screenplay is a derivative mash of other movies (PartArthur & Invisibles, partFerngully: The Last Rainforest). The film lacks the inspiration and the ingenuity that makes Pixar so great, the entertaining characters of Disney, but comes up close with DreamWorks in terms of lush atmosphere and beautiful animation (Is it just me, or is DreamWorks on a roll with How to Train Your Dragon, Kung-fu Panda 2, and The Croods?). I've never really LOVED Blue Sky Studios. I mean, the first ICE AGE is entertaining, but ROBOTS, HORTON HEARS A WHO, and the ICE AGE sequels were really hit-or-miss. RIO was fun and colorful, and like EPIC, beautifully animated, but Blue Sky has yet to combine heart, humour, excellent animation, and a great plot. Still, Epic impressed me in several ways, and I will go over them below.So those are my cons. That andBeyonc&eacute;, whose voice performance is woefully out of place.But as I said above, EPIC impressed me. It is the most gorgeously animated, beautifully drawn, lush, atmospheric, detailed, visually stunning animated film I have seen all year. The detail put into the costumes, down to the clasps and buckles, harnesses, and jewelery is simply incredible. The characters are beautifully designed and rendered, behaving naturally and realistically. The proportions are realistic, and the animation of the lush green trees and sparkling streams will take your breath away. A small scene with a deer will take your breath away. I give the film extra points for being the most colorful, breathtakingly animated children's film I've seen in a long time.The voicework, too, is superb.Amanda SeyfriedandJosh Hutchersonare excellent as human teen Mary-Katherine (who goes by MK) and the reckless Nod. The supporting cast, which include Steven Tyler, Pitbull, and Jason Sudeikis are beyond criticism, but the two standout roles are that ofColin FarrellandChristoph Waltz, who imbibe their cool characters with charisma, emotion, and energy. Farrell plays Ronin, the sword-wielding, hummingbird-flying, bottom-kicking head of the ""Leafmen"", while Waltz plays the surprisingly sympathetic and fully-fleshed villain - Mandrake.Other areas where EPIC succeeds is the typically-good Danny Elfman score (he's never bad!), the action, in which ""Boggans"" and ""Leafmen"" fight with surprisingly real and devastating consequences, and the presence of two incredibly cute snails, who give the much-needed levity.In conclusion, EPIC might not be as epic as it thinks it is, nor as original or inspired, but as a gorgeously animated, character-strong animated film that provides kids with good role-models and messages, while entertaining them with ""epic"" conflicts and amazing visuals...it ain't half bad!

I was only afraid that ""Epic"" would be the Michael Bay of animated movies. Following ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Star Trek: Into Darkness"" in its release date and opening the same week of ""The Hangover 3"" and ""Fast and Furious 6"", it is certainly up against big competition. Fortunately, that wasn't what I saw. What I saw was an adventure of thought-provoking depth that did exactly what I love most in movies; it took me to another world and kept me there until the credits rolled.Mary Katherine or M.K. (Amanda Seyfried) is a character who has a distant relationship with her father and is still feeling the effects of the death of her mother. Her father has been buried in his research and there is a lot of animosity between them. He is convinced that there is a tiny culture of beings inhabiting the forest that surrounds their home. There are some deep subjects in the movie that may go over some children's heads, as well as some non-charismatic moments from Collin Farrell's Character, Ronin, which may bore you and your child to death.Honestly though, I liked that there was some complexity to it. While the movie incorporated the things that have made other Blue Sky Studios movies (""Ice Age"", ""Rio"" & ""Robots"") hits with all ages, it also had a depth and imagination to it that reminded me of movies like ""The Dark Crystal"", ""Labyrinth"" and ""The Never Ending Story"".It is easy to say that ""Epic"" is possibly one of the most beautifully animated 3D movies I've seen to date. Again, the 3D adds to the, dare I say, epicness of the film. Nestled in the yards and woods is an epic world of Leafmen and Boggans that control the life and death of nature as we know it. The 3-dimensional world comes to life as we explore a world on the backs of hummingbirds and see streams, trees, springs and tunnels up close.There's a little something missing with ""Epic"" though. There's almost a dryness that leaves some of the emotions flat and never truly capitalizes on the urgency we should feel as an audience. It wasn't hard connecting with M.K. but she too easily adapts to the task she is given and despite not knowing how she will return to normal life, she seems to go ahead without emotion; fear, joy or anything otherwise. That being said, the slug and snail characters added much needed comic relief.I do recommend ""Epic"" because I enjoyed myself. Although if the writers had spent less time hammering home the nuts and bolts of the miniature world culture, which we understood in the first twenty minutes of the film, they could have spent more time making a better ending to the film and fleshing out some true and more widespread emotion. It could have been a better film, but that's not saying it wasn't more entertaining than most of the stuff out there these days.",4,SCREENPLAY spent too much time in certain places,1369612800,"05 27, 2013",2013,2835,"['name', 'Epic', 'be', 'big', 'least', 'should', 'be', 'was', 'only', 'afraid', 'Epic', 'would', 'be', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'animated', 'movies', 'Following', 'Iron', 'Man', '3', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Into', 'Darkness', 'release', 'date', 'opening', 'same', 'week', 'Hangover', '3', 'Fast', 'Furious', '6', 'certainly', 'up', 'big', 'competition', 'Fortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'saw', 'What', 'saw', 'was', 'adventure', 'thought-provoking', 'depth', 'did', 'exactly', 'what', 'love', 'most', 'movies', 'took', 'world', 'kept', 'there', 'credits', 'rolled.Mary', 'Katherine', 'M.K', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'character', 'who', 'distant', 'relationship', 'father', 'still', 'feeling', 'effects', 'death', 'mother', 'father', 'been', 'buried', 'research', 'lot', 'animosity', 'convinced', 'tiny', 'culture', 'beings', 'inhabiting', 'forest', 'home', 'are', 'deep', 'subjects', 'movie', 'may', 'go', 'over', 'children', 'heads', 'as', 'well', 'non-charismatic', 'moments', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'Character', 'Ronin', 'may', 'bore', 'child', 'death.Honestly', 'liked', 'was', 'complexity', 'movie', 'incorporated', 'things', 'have', 'made', 'other', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'movies', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Rio', 'Robots', 'ages', 'also', 'had', 'depth', 'imagination', 'reminded', 'movies', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Labyrinth', 'Never', 'Ending', 'Story', '.It', 'easy', 'say', 'Epic', 'possibly', 'one', 'most', 'beautifully', 'animated', '3D', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'date', 'Again', '3D', 'dare', 'say', 'epicness', 'film', 'Nestled', 'yards', 'woods', 'epic', 'world', 'Leafmen', 'Boggans', 'control', 'life', 'death', 'nature', 'know', '3-dimensional', 'world', 'life', 'explore', 'world', 'backs', 'hummingbirds', 'see', 'streams', 'trees', 'springs', 'tunnels', 'up', 'close.There', 'little', 'something', 'missing', 'Epic', 'almost', 'dryness', 'emotions', 'flat', 'never', 'truly', 'urgency', 'should', 'feel', 'audience', 'was', ""n't"", 'hard', 'connecting', 'M.K', 'too', 'easily', 'task', 'given', 'not', 'knowing', 'how', 'will', 'return', 'normal', 'life', 'go', 'ahead', 'emotion', 'fear', 'joy', 'anything', 'otherwise', 'being', 'said', 'slug', 'snail', 'characters', 'added', 'much', 'needed', 'comic', 'relief.I', 'do', 'recommend', 'Epic', 'enjoyed', 'writers', 'had', 'spent', 'less', 'time', 'hammering', 'home', 'nuts', 'bolts', 'miniature', 'world', 'culture', 'understood', 'first', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'making', 'better', 'ending', 'film', 'fleshing', 'out', 'true', 'more', 'widespread', 'emotion', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'film', 'not', 'saying', 'was', ""n't"", 'more', 'entertaining', 'most', 'stuff', 'there', 'days']",N/A

(case in point: Beyonce Knowles, Amanda Seyfried, etc.)-- Amazingly, Steven Tyler does a good job w/ his role; but the song he spontaneously erupts into, was forced & didn't do much, aside from make me want to hit fast-forward. (luckily, it wasn't long)-- Colin did good; but Josh's character lacked substance & even a modicum of originality... being that it's a  clear regurgitation of countless other similar characters of recent years, in animation particularly. (see Disney's ""Tangled"" for example, also a 3D flick; but at least that one was pretty good.)This may very well be the most visually appealing (animated) 3D movie to date... But because of the aforementioned, laziness, and bone-headed moves by the Studio &/or Director... That's all you're left with really: A visually stunning 3D flick, that your YOUNG children will love; but which everyone else will likely loathe, or just plain hate.I had absolutely no preconceptions about this movie.  Naturally, I went in hoping it would be enjoyable; but I didn't think it was going to be ""the most awesome animated movie ever"", for example, so it's not like my expectations were high (or too high, for that matter). __ Also, I didn't know who any of the ""cast"" was, until the credits rolled... which is how I prefer to watch all animated movies for the 1st time.PS: In case you're wondering, why 2 stars, instead of 1?... well...

Yet even young would-be botanists will find this charmless animated adventure as exciting as watching grass grow.On the forest floor, tiny leaf-men ride birds and watch over the forest. Their queen is choosing a small bud to become her heir when the evil Boggans, who live to rot away greenery, interrupt her. The bud lands with human teen Mary Katherine, who's visiting her nutty professor dad at his cabin.Grasping the bud as a full moon rises, M.K. is shrunk down to leaf-man size. Recruited to help leaf-man warrior Ronin and young soldier Nod, M.K. learns that every daisy, dandelion and stick has a face, as her dad suspected, and that a skeletal creature called Mandrake wants to rule the forest. A caterpillar librarian croaks out a song. An annoying slug-and-snail team provide ""comic"" relief.It all gets massively tedious, a ripoff of Pixar's ""A Bug's Life"" and Disney's sweet and expansive ""Tinker Bell"" direct-to-DVD movies. You can hear actors plopping down to collect paychecks as they voice characters so thin they could be knocked over by a spore.The lesson that life is ""many leaves connected to one tree"" is sprinkled on like an afterthought, just like the muddy 3-D. Even the title sounds as if no one could think of anything wittier. There's also a three-legged, one-eyed old pug dog that's meant to be ""awww!"" but comes off ""ewww!""

Beyonce as the queen is pretty weak, but her role is so small as not to detract from the plot.All in all, I'd say this is a good family film with rich emotions, decent dialogue and even good comedy (supplied by the slug and snail).Highly recommended!",4,Enjoyable and Heartfelt Movie,1380412800,"09 29, 2013",2013,633,"['knew', 'little', 'Epic', 'renting', 'wife', 'were', 'totally', 'enthralled', 'parts', 'film', 'are', 'bit', 'formulaic', 'possibly', 'borrowing', 'similar', 'films', 'FernGully', 'Arthur', 'Invisibles', 'However', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'immensely', 'animation', 'glorious', 'characters', 'likeable', 'villain', 'typical', 'two-dimensional', 'good', 'antagonist', 'Beyonce', 'queen', 'pretty', 'weak', 'role', 'so', 'small', 'not', 'detract', 'plot.All', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', 'family', 'film', 'rich', 'emotions', 'decent', 'dialogue', 'even', 'good', 'comedy', 'supplied', 'slug', 'snail', '.Highly', 'recommended']",N/A

(Shades of FernGully and Arthur and the Invisibles).The original title for this movie was Leaf Men.  But the marketing department of Fox changed the title to Epic (even though this movie is anything but epic).  The story is packed with the usual stock characters starting with a girl (Amanda Seyfried voicing M.K.) who gets shrunk like Alice in Wonderland so she can walk and talk with the flowers.  There's the obligatory rebel/slacker boy (Josh Hutcherson), the wise and brave warrior Ronin (Colin Farrell), the gratuitously absentminded professor (Jason Sudeikis), and two `cute' sidekicks Mub and Grub (a snail and slug).  Naturally, there is a villain, Mandrake, leader of the Boggans (voiced by Christoph Waltz).  The usual conflicts arise, a fight between good and evil, the need to protect THE forest.  The outcome is just what you'd expect.  Getting there required nothing that hasn't been done before in countless other adventure flicks.On the plus side, this is a beautiful animated feature, lovely to behold.  The musical score by Danny Elfman is exceptional (I bought the CD).  Some of the voice talent makes sense and works great (some voices simply distract).  It is a likable movie.

1651549,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00CWM58WY,FNDNreview,"[10, 17]","If there's one thing you can pretty much always count on in an animated feature, it's the often stale, incredibly predictable theme of good vs. evil.  If you take a moment to think back to the abundance of animated films you've had to endure through the years (both in adolescence and adulthood), try to find a film that was somehow different from the last.  Are you thinking?  It's actually quite difficult (even though Toy Story stands out).  For whatever reason, most everyone has an animated film that is near and dear to their heart, but it's nearly impossible to find one of these nowadays.  Is it because the classic animated films, like The Lion King or Sleeping Beauty, were a part of our childhood?  Or is it that the animation is so well done these days that plot points have been completely sacrificed?  Who needs a plot when you can just have a squirrel chase a nut, or hire A-list actor to voice another generic character?  This all brings us to the review for Blue Sky Studios' newest animated feature, Epic.Directed by Chris Wedge (Ice Age, Robots), Epic stars the voice of Amanda Seyfried as Mary Katherine (M.K.), a 17 year old girl that moves in with her father, Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) after her mother dies.  Unfortunately for M.K., her father spends his time searching for evidence that there's little bug sized people living in the forest outside his house, a world in which M.K. is quickly thrust into.  Naturally, Bomba's theory is correct, and the forest houses the protectors of the forest, known as Leafmen, along with the evil Boggans.  When the forest queen, Queen Tara (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles) decides to choose her heir, the evil lead of the Boggans, Mandrake (Christoph Waltz) decides to attack.  Naturally, it's up to the queen's protectors, Ronin (Colin Farrell) and Nod (Josh Hutcherson) to make sure Mandrake's evil doesn't destroy the forest.  The voices of Steven Tyler, Pitbull, and Aziz Ansari also star in supporting roles.Right off the bat, the character voices are pretty distinct.  Amanda Seyfried contributes well enough in her role as the lead, not to mention Josh Hutcherson was a pretty safe choice for the role of Nod.  When it comes to Colin Farrell, he's an actor that's pretty easy to identify by the sound of his voice, and it's hard not to wonder if he would have been more effective in the role of the villain, Mandrake.  Christoph Waltz is one of the most enjoyable actors in Hollywood, but he doesn't really provide that deep, dark voice that's required for a believable villain.  From there, things get pretty questionable with a handful of the other character actors who are mostly out of place and probably don't belong in this film.  There are actors and actresses in the business that simply do animation voices, but instead of using some of these talented individuals, they have to give way to pointless additions, like Beyonc&eacute; and Pitbull.  Of course, I have this same gripe when I see any so-called ""talented"" musicians suddenly trying to be actors/actresses.As far as Epic's story goes, there's very little here that hasn't been done before in regards to the development of themes.  The good vs. evil element is once again thrust upon us, as if for one second anyone would believe the animated evil-doer ever stood a chance against the bumbling, amateur protagonist.  The film has a sort of Star Wars meets Avatar vibe to it, especially with all the bird travel.  If these characters had laser guns, it would be just about on par - and oddly enough, while the soldiers typically use bow and arrows to do their fighting, the ""good"" and ""bad"" leaders both feed off of ""force -like"" powers...from the forest.As usual, Epic is pretty outstanding animation to look at, with bright colors that are awe inspiring to the eyes, especially considering you're reading a review by a person that still holds 1929's The Opry House (starring Mickey Mouse in black and white) in pretty high regard.  In any event, Epic has its moments of humor, sadness, and excitement - all of which fits the bill of a typical animated film.  As long as the animated violence or brief moments of dark peril aren't a hang-up, this film earns an average recommendation for kids.  Adults, on the other hand, will have little to no interest in this film.Final Grade:  C-FNDNreview.com",2,'Epic' an average adventure in the forest,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",2013,4331,"['one', 'thing', 'can', 'pretty', 'much', 'always', 'count', 'animated', 'feature', 'often', 'stale', 'incredibly', 'predictable', 'theme', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'take', 'moment', 'think', 'back', 'abundance', 'animated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'had', 'endure', 'years', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'try', 'find', 'film', 'was', 'somehow', 'different', 'last', 'Are', 'thinking', 'actually', 'quite', 'difficult', 'even', 'Toy', 'Story', 'out', 'reason', 'most', 'everyone', 'animated', 'film', 'near', 'dear', 'heart', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'find', 'one', 'nowadays', 'classic', 'animated', 'films', 'Lion', 'King', 'Sleeping', 'Beauty', 'were', 'part', 'childhood', 'animation', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'days', 'plot', 'points', 'have', 'been', 'completely', 'sacrificed', 'Who', 'plot', 'when', 'can', 'just', 'have', 'squirrel', 'chase', 'nut', 'hire', 'A-list', 'actor', 'voice', 'generic', 'character', 'review', 'Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'newest', 'animated', 'feature', 'Epic.Directed', 'Chris', 'Wedge', 'Ice', 'Age', 'Robots', 'Epic', 'voice', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'Mary', 'Katherine', 'M.K', '17', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'father', 'Professor', 'Bomba', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'mother', 'dies', 'Unfortunately', 'M.K.', 'father', 'time', 'searching', 'evidence', 'little', 'bug', 'sized', 'people', 'living', 'forest', 'house', 'world', 'M.K', 'quickly', 'thrust', 'Naturally', 'Bomba', 'theory', 'correct', 'forest', 'houses', 'protectors', 'forest', 'known', 'Leafmen', 'evil', 'Boggans', 'When', 'forest', 'queen', 'Queen', 'Tara', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'choose', 'heir', 'evil', 'lead', 'Boggans', 'Mandrake', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'attack', 'Naturally', 'up', 'queen', 'protectors', 'Ronin', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'Nod', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'make', 'sure', 'Mandrake', 'evil', ""n't"", 'destroy', 'forest', 'voices', 'Steven', 'Tyler', 'Pitbull', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'also', 'supporting', 'roles.Right', 'off', 'bat', 'character', 'voices', 'are', 'pretty', 'distinct', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'well', 'enough', 'role', 'lead', 'not', 'mention', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'was', 'pretty', 'safe', 'choice', 'role', 'Nod', 'When', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'actor', 'pretty', 'easy', 'identify', 'sound', 'voice', 'hard', 'not', 'wonder', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective', 'role', 'villain', 'Mandrake', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', 'one', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'actors', 'Hollywood', ""n't"", 'really', 'provide', 'deep', 'dark', 'voice', 'required', 'believable', 'villain', 'there', 'things', 'get', 'pretty', 'questionable', 'handful', 'other', 'character', 'actors', 'who', 'are', 'mostly', 'place', 'probably', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'film', 'are', 'actors', 'actresses', 'business', 'simply', 'do', 'animation', 'voices', 'instead', 'using', 'talented', 'individuals', 'have', 'give', 'way', 'pointless', 'additions', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Pitbull', 'course', 'have', 'same', 'gripe', 'when', 'see', 'so-called', 'talented', 'musicians', 'suddenly', 'trying', 'be', 'actors/actresses.As', 'far', 'Epic', 'story', 'very', 'little', 'here', ""n't"", 'been', 'done', 'regards', 'development', 'themes', 'good', 'vs.', 'evil', 'element', 'once', 'again', 'thrust', 'one', 'second', 'anyone', 'would', 'believe', 'animated', 'evil-doer', 'ever', 'stood', 'chance', 'bumbling', 'amateur', 'protagonist', 'film', 'sort', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Avatar', 'vibe', 'especially', 'bird', 'travel', 'characters', 'had', 'laser', 'guns', 'would', 'be', 'just', 'par', 'oddly', 'enough', 'soldiers', 'typically', 'use', 'bow', 'arrows', 'do', 'fighting', 'good', 'bad', 'leaders', 'feed', 'force', '-like', 'powers', 'forest.As', 'usual', 'Epic', 'pretty', 'outstanding', 'animation', 'look', 'bright', 'colors', 'are', 'awe', 'inspiring', 'eyes', 'especially', 'considering', ""'re"", 'reading', 'review', 'person', 'still', '1929', 'Opry', 'House', 'starring', 'Mickey', 'Mouse', 'black', 'white', 'pretty', 'high', 'regard', 'event', 'Epic', 'moments', 'humor', 'sadness', 'excitement', 'bill', 'typical', 'animated', 'film', 'As', 'long', 'animated', 'violence', 'brief', 'moments', 'dark', 'peril', 'are', ""n't"", 'hang-up', 'film', 'average', 'recommendation', 'kids', 'Adults', 'other', 'hand', 'will', 'have', 'little', 'interest', 'film.Final', 'Grade', 'C-FNDNreview.com']",N/A

1651564,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00CWM58WY,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","Blue Sky Studios, the animation posse that rolled out Ice Age and Rio, released Epic in 2013, keenly ambitious to achieve competitive status with Pixar and with DreamWorks. Instead Blue Sky merely treads water. Epic adapts William Joyce's classic children's picture book, ""The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs.""Beneath our noses, beyond our ken, a mighty war rages for the soul of our ecosystem - and, hopefully, I didn't lose anyone just then with that mention of ""ecosystem."" Gratifyingly, this movie doesn't try to sway you with a dreary environmentalist message. It's not Ferngully risen from the dead. We're alerted to the existence of an enchanted realm that you and I habitually walk over and past. In this miniature world, the brave Leafmen, 2"" tall forest sprites astride hummingbirds and wearing armor fashioned from the exoskeletons of bugs, wage fierce combat with the Boggans, fell creatures that resemble storybook trolls and goblins. It's a difference in ideology, you see. The Boggans fervently espouse a universal state of rot and decay. They mean to expand their putrefying kingdom of Rotwood. The Leafmen would rather say, ""No, thank you.""And, in the human world, there's unhappy 17-year-old Mary Katherine (voiced by Amanda Seyfried), come to visit her estranged scientist father, Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis). Prof. Bomba is one of them absent-minded sorts who lives in a ramshackle house by the woods. Someone observes: ""That's not a house. That's termites holding hands.""Note that the professor isn't a bad guy. He doesn't mean to be a bad dad. He's excessively preoccupied  with his work and seriously eccentric. I don't know that there would've been an ideal period for Mary Katherine - or just ""MK"" - to move in. Expect the awkwardness between them. Anticipate a wealth of confusion from the pater, bursts of hostility from the child.For years Professor Bomba has been super-obsessed with gathering evidence about the existence of a miniature society. But it's MK who inadvertently makes the breakthru when she's transported (ie: shrunk down to 2 inches) to the Leafmen's world. Her immediate reaction: ""Who are you people? Is this some sort of reenactment?"" MK is promptly recruited by Queen Tara (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles), a beleaguered nature spirit, to safeguard a fragile pod from which the heir apparent will emerge to set things right. MK is accompanied in her quest by two pod caretakers in the form of a snail and a slug (they, uh, keep the pods moist), the impulsive young Leafman Nod (Josh Hutcherson), and the stern veteran soldier Ronin who at one point is announced as the ""defender of the weak, pooper of parties"" (Colin Farrell).Does Epic have massive rewatchability? Sure, if you're looking at it from a visual perspective. The film looks spectacular, replete with striking character designs and a lush, dizzying visual palette that recalls A Bug's Life. The voice talents are of all-star caliber, even Pitbull and Steven Tyler don't embarass themselves. The action sequences are choreographed with flair. Love the embattled hummingbirds in flitting motion.3.5 out of 5 stars, mostly because of the stellar animation. Maybe someone was being tongue-in-cheek when they came up with the film title. To me, the scope of the narrative falls short of epic. There's a place for a work like Epic, sure. It falls in that category of safe filmmaking. That old list is whipped out, those trope boxes are checked off. Story-wise, nothing stands out, not the plodding hero's quest, not the angry teen who's suffered a loss, not the oblivious parent, not the bland young hero or the wise veteran, and not the comic relief mollusks. Maybe there's something to using invertebrate creatures for running gags. The humor will titillate them young 'uns, you betcha, but it's humor that favors the spineless approach. If there's a defining passion present, it's more a mercenary bend that's directed towards the marketing of Epic toys, shirts, and video games. I wonder, are there mass-market action figures spinning out of indie films by independent artists like Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle), Marjane Satrapi & Vincent Parronaud (Persepolis), or Jean-Loup Felicioli & Alain Gagnol (A Cat in Paris)? Brad Bird's The Iron Giant, considered both a commercial film and an artistic triumph, probably comes closest to spooling out commercial merchandise. Sorry, it's 2:30am and I just caught myself ranting. Listen, if you're just looking to park your kid in front of the screen for a mo, then Epic is your huckleberry. It ticks me off, though. It's so good to look at, the animation is impeccable. It's deserving of a story with more heft, more originality, even more spark. Having said that, my niece wants plush toys of the slug and the snail. Dammit.The DVD's bonus stuff:- ""Birds, Bugs and Slugs: Forest Explorer"" - a look at the real-life creatures the film characters are based on (00:05:21 minutes)- ""Bugs of Camouflage"" - Ken the Bug Guy explains bugs that employ camouflage (00:03:45 minutes)- ""Rot Rocks"" - a tutorial on how rot and decay actually help to maintain balance in our ecosystem (00:03:18 minutes)- Theatrical

I sit in the dark, staring at what I know are drawings, but feel their emotions, watch their human quirks and relate to their problems. Twentieth Century Fox and Blue Skys has collaborated on this sweet ""Epic"" that features a girl as the main protagonist. I didn't see any boys walk out, either! Everyone liked the three-legged, one-eyed Pug, which was so cute when our heroine was full sized, but terrifying when she is the size of the Leaf People...as was that cute little mouse.Of course current movie stars like to have ""Voice Artist"" added to their r&eacute;sum&eacute;, so these folks did the honors:* Amanda Seyfried (""Les Miserables"") is Mary Katherine, a teenager who goes to the forest to live with her father. She soon realizes that his fixation with the Leaf People leaves no room for her, so she gets ready to leave but lets the dog out by mistake and our story begins...* Jason Sudeikis (""Horrible Bosses"") is her father, Professor Bomba, who has been on a futile, decades-long quest to prove the existence of the Leaf People. He has remote cameras mounted throughout the forest. He wears wire-rimmed glasses and has a Conan-type high-swept forelock.* Beyonc&eacute; Knowles (""Dreamgirls"") is Queen Tara, she keeps the magical bulb, defends her people and secretly loves her guardsman, Ronin.* Colin Farrell (""In Bruges"") is Ronin, the stalwart commander of the Leaf People, who is trying to protect the forest from Mandrake and keep his promise to his queen.* Christoph Waltz (""Inglorious Basterds"") is Mandrake. Everything dies in his presence. If he succeeds in taking over the forest, the Leaf People will perish.* Josh Hutcherson (""The Hunger Games"") is Nod, a rookie Leaf Soldier who quits his post as soon as we meet him. He is impetuous and a little over-confident.Ronin was particularly well-drawn and voiced; Farrell gave us enough accent to remind us that he isn't local, but it was a gentle touch. His feelings for the queen are unmistakable, but not over-stated. The deer, the mouse and the pond, all were breathtakingly life-like.

Then at other times they would not be much better than some T.V. fare.The story was nothing new, almost being a combination of 'The Great Fairy Rescue', 'Fern Gully', 'A Bugs Life' and 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids'.The slug and the snail had the funniest moments. The main bad guy was very well done, but was nothing new.The lead character, M.K., jumped to quickly into her new world, without any shock or surprise (maybe kids in this high-tec age don't get shocked and surprised as much,).'Nim', voiced by Steven Tyler of Aerosmith fame, was my favorite in both animation and voice, but even that character seemed stolen from 'The Wizard of OZ'.Although I like Josh Hutcherson, the voice of 'Nod', in most things, the animation of his character let down his performance.M.K's father was also well acted and drawn, but was to much like Rick Moranis' character in 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' and ""Dr Griffiths' in 'The Great Fairy Rescue.""The best animation seemed to be reserved for the lesser characters, some of which were very well done.I was hoping the animation of the forest atmosphere would be on the lines of 'Avatar', when in fact it didn't even measure up to the 'Tinkerbell' movies.The battles and conflicts were not epic enough.Even with a few visual delights, I came out a little disappointed.Daughter found parts a little scary and dark, but over all she liked it.So, for these reasons, I can only give it 3 Mub's and Grub's out of 5",3,'EPIC'. . . .

I know some say 'well, heck... it's just a kid's movie.  What does it matter?  They watch movies about santa claus all the time!'  True.  But you need to remember that kid's are learning machines, especially as they get younger.  They are sponges which absorb nigh on everything around them, which is why raising them is a really important responsibility.Within the film, certain concepts are given unrealistic parity.  Life is good, decay is bad.  Colorful is good.  Dark is bad.  It's kinda classic 'good vs. evil' but taken into the realm of nature where that sort of thing is essentially nonexistent.  Granted, the 'queen' character strives to keep a balance, and I suppose that's almost good... but the film wholly misidentifies the very nature of the natural cycle, and that decay is, itself, LIFE... small to microscopic living things being a crucial part of the food chain as they consume and break down things that have passed on.  It's not evil... it's absolutely necessary, and forms much of the very basis of the food chain itself.  Without it, none of us could exist.  Compounding that error, any creature that has a dark shade (crows, bats, rats, etc) are automatically slanted as corrupt as evil, and that's tragic, too.These are simplistic and misinformed perspectives that society kinda actually has to get away from, so filling the super absorbent minds of children with it... does not come recommended.  Which is too bad because, as I'd said, the humor and writing was otherwise pretty good.

Thomason ""Movie Family""","[2, 4]","Epic (well, NOT-Epic might be a little closer to the truth) Bowling for Movies Score: 147 of 300Bowling for Movies is a score that I, just your average dude (hereafter referred to as The Movie Dude), have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula using chili dog sauce and kettle corn (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throwing too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]Epic - we own the 3D Blu Ray combo packMovie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):A teenage girl gets more than she bargains for when, by chance, she is drawn into a secret society of little people known as Leafmen who are involved in maintaining a sacred magical balance that keeps the forest alive.  Having been transformed into a pint-sized heroine, M.K. must help the Leafmen save the day in this fish-out-of-water story loosely based on a popular children's book.Bowling Score Breakdown:Strikes (what I loved)I need to be blunt - this movie had the best CGI animation I think I have ever seen.  EVERY detail on EVERY leaf on EVERY tree was wonderfully, carefully, and lovingly placed.  The characters were rendered to near photo-realism.  I would pay money to simply have been able to walk around the forest and interact with creatures therein... wondrous to behold!  We watched the movie in 3D and here I have to tell you, the film visuals were incredible - no ghosting, no blurry side shots, simply done to perfection.  These guys know how to animate a feature film.  Academy Award level animation here.Spares (what I liked)Adding to the stunning visuals is a good soundtrack which isn't too surprising - when Danny Elfman is around, good music follows.  He's like, the man.Gutterballs (what I didn't like)I hate to say it - there were several gutterballs in this movie.  It's sad because there was so much going right in the animation department but... the story was weak, watered down, and uninspiring.  ""Epic"" is really a misnomer, the story was a bad mix of eco-warrior action, silly `unlikely friend' humor, Disney-esque dead parent sadness, and back to the action/adventure - all strung together in a ho-hum, let's get to the end already tale.  I started looking at my watch 20 minutes in which is not good because this movie had such potential.  I know this eco-warrior theme is all the rage right now but it's been done (and better).  I'd say this movie would prove interesting to kids in the 7-10 age bracket which is pretty thin.  Besides this I just have to tell you - I can remember a day when kid's movies had boy heros and those seem to be a rare beast these days.  I have a daughter (hereafter called Little Miss Movie Dude) so I am totally down with the girl lead in the story idea but it seems like we have been inundated with princess type movies for well over a decade - it might be interesting, cinematically, if Hollywood was a little more equal opportunity, just saying.  We could be doing better than this and I think it would help freshen up these 'been there, done that' stories.Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

The animation was beautifully done. The story was predictable yet satisfying. The characters are all right, though I barely remember a lot of their names, which tells you just how memorable they really were. Not exactly Ariel, Aladdin, or Belle here. (And as to animated films I've seen lately, it's got nothing on Frozen, but that's a whole other story, situation, etc.)Story synopsis: The queen of the Leafmen who is the life of the forest gets ambushed but not before she chooses a pod which will pass her gift on to a successor. It falls to Nod, MK, Grub, a slug, and Ronin to safeguard the chosen pod until it's time for it to bloom. The Bogmen and their malificent leader, Mandrake, seek to capture the pod which is the greatest threat to their power.Random comments: If I was a kid, I'd probably be creeped out by a lot of this movie. The Bogmen wear rat hides and ride bats around like flying steeds.Nod's attitude rankles a lot. He comes off as an irresponsible little twit instead of the cool rebel I think he's meant to be.Mary Katherine (MK) learns some important lessons but she doesn't actually do all that much until her important epiphany at the critical moment.The comic relief provided by the slug and snail is well-timed.The Bogmen's motive seems flimsy at best.The three-legged dog, Ozzy, is probably the best character. Also good comic relief.Ronin's probably the coolest character, though I wish they'd explained more about the relationship between him and Queen Tara.Conclusion: Beautifully done movie, standard story (sometimes illogical, though that's forgivable in a fantasy tale), standard characters, some scary scenes. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone less than 10 ish. It's got some epic fight scenes, but it's also got quite a few creep factors.",4,"Interesting, Illogical, Charming, Predictable, Random, Weird, Slightly Scary, Amusing",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",2014,1865,"['whole', 'lot', 'things.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'title', 'minor', 'complaint', 'animation', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', 'story', 'was', 'predictable', 'yet', 'satisfying', 'characters', 'are', 'right', 'barely', 'remember', 'lot', 'names', 'just', 'how', 'memorable', 'really', 'were', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Ariel', 'Aladdin', 'Belle', 'here', 'animated', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'lately', 'got', 'nothing', 'Frozen', 'whole', 'other', 'story', 'situation', 'etc', 'Story', 'synopsis', 'queen', 'Leafmen', 'who', 'life', 'forest', 'ambushed', 'not', 'pod', 'will', 'pass', 'gift', 'successor', 'Nod', 'MK', 'Grub', 'slug', 'Ronin', 'safeguard', 'chosen', 'pod', 'time', 'bloom', 'Bogmen', 'malificent', 'leader', 'Mandrake', 'seek', 'capture', 'pod', 'greatest', 'threat', 'power.Random', 'comments', 'was', 'kid', ""'d"", 'probably', 'be', 'creeped', 'out', 'lot', 'movie', 'Bogmen', 'wear', 'rat', 'hides', 'ride', 'bats', 'flying', 'steeds.Nod', 'attitude', 'lot', 'off', 'irresponsible', 'little', 'twit', 'instead', 'cool', 'rebel', 'think', 'meant', 'be.Mary', 'Katherine', 'MK', 'important', 'lessons', ""n't"", 'actually', 'do', 'much', 'important', 'epiphany', 'critical', 'moment.The', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'slug', 'snail', 'well-timed.The', 'Bogmen', 'motive', 'flimsy', 'best.The', 'three-legged', 'dog', 'Ozzy', 'probably', 'best', 'character', 'Also', 'good', 'comic', 'relief.Ronin', 'probably', 'coolest', 'character', 'wish', ""'d"", 'explained', 'more', 'relationship', 'Queen', 'Tara.Conclusion', 'Beautifully', 'done', 'movie', 'standard', 'story', 'sometimes', 'illogical', 'forgivable', 'fantasy', 'tale', 'standard', 'characters', 'scary', 'scenes', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'anyone', 'less', '10', 'ish', 'got', 'epic', 'fight', 'scenes', 'also', 'got', 'quite', 'few', 'creep', 'factors']",N/A

The animation is just about perfect, with incredible depth of scene and color that's a marvel to behold. The story is also good smart fun, a kids' fantasy with lots of moments to make adults smile was well.The highlight here for me was the voicework. Seyfried and Farrell are both very fine,  but Tyler and especially Waltz really make things jump. Waltz is a perfect villain, displaying a range that most voice actors would do well to study. Tyler's comic relief is a treat, and his voice is certainly the most recognizable I can think of, like a modern Jimmy Durante. Ansari also turns in a nice comic performance.I noted various critics pointing out that this plot resembles a few other kids' nature dramas, to which I say: great! We need a dozen times more films focusing on mankind's self-sabotaging dominator attitude to our planet. Any plot or story that helps kids relate to all life on our planet as part of their heritage and responsibilities is a wonderful and necessary thing in my eyes. Epic does it very well, I think.Elfman's score is pitch perfect, but never draws attention to itself. It highlights every scene yet fits so well that you almost don't notice it, which in some ways is the ultimate compliment for film music. Hard to say when Elfman finds time to sleep, as he's been competing with Hans Zimmer for the title of Hardest Working Man In Soundtrack Business for many years now. Long may they both compose.There's really nothing to not like here, and lots to love.

A young girl is magically transported to a small world where evil creatures are trying to kill the queen of the forest.  Now then, doom awaits any movie where the viewer is constantly reminded of similar works.  Instead of being involved into this picture's tale, all I could think of was how certain scenes were like those found in ""Avatar"" (2009), ""Ferngully - The Last Rainforest"" (1992), ""A Bug's Life"" (1998) and ""Arrietty (a.k.a.

Talk about false advertising in a title!COMMENTS:  {SPOILER ALERT}  First observation - I hate movies with pretentious narration.  This flick was in trouble immediately when M.K. muses that ""someone once told her"" something lofty.  Don't you hate that!  It's always ""they say"" or ""somebody told me.""  It is annoying because it is contrived.  If a character must speak to the audience, then let it be from their heart.  I don't care what someone else said and did.  If it is your story, then tell it truthfully without filters.  ""They"" can go jump in a lake.  I don't give a flying rat about ""they"" and neither should any viewer.  Imparting faux wisdom in such a timid and indirect manner is no way to capture the audience's attention.  There - I said it.  Last observation - what is with the notion that small creatures move in a faster dimension?  This is dumb.  Anyone ever kill a bug with a fly swatter?  All of us, huh?  That is what I thought.

Hart, and Daniel Shere took a wonderful children novel by William Joyce called `The Leaf Man and the Brave Good Bugs', and turned this film into a magnificently looking film adventure with a very big heart.Director Chris Wedge, (Robots, Ice Age -and he is the voice of Scrat in the Ice Age features and shorts) took his time and fined tuned the story and action to make you understand what is important to each of us. Family and your friends are defiantly something worth cultivating because in the long run, we cannot survive without them.Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games, The Kids Are Alright) voices Nod, a more than independent young man who doesn't like to follow the rules. Trying to be mentored by a sincerely honest and often frustrated Collin Farrell (Phone Booth, Total Recall) as Ronin, the leader of the planet and tree warriors trying to do his best to show Nod what good decisions can lead to as he defends the forest from rot.Enter a disconnected father and daughter, Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia!, Les Miserables) playing Mary Katherine or M.K. and Jason Sudeikis (Horrible Bosses, The Campaign) playing Bomba her father, who just can't seem to connect with each other on any level. Her decision to move away from her father changes as she learns a valuable lesson.Now dad's mission is to prove that the forest is cultivated, developed and designed by small forest people who maintain the balance of beauty, life and growth in the woods. His daughter more than skeptical, ventures out and on her way of distracting herself becomes involved in a really fun magical adventure.Queen Tara, queen of the forest and all its magic and beauty, is voiced by Beyonce Knowles (Obsessed, Cadillac Records) - is taunted by the ever evil rot of the forest Mandrake who is voiced by Christoph Waltz (Django, Water for Elephants) ,who only wants everything dead and covered with mold and rot. Cruel and vicious is mandrake while Queen Tara finds an unsuspecting hero in an unsuspecting place.Without saying much more, the bad guys do some serious damage to life and the forest overall and it's an unexpected and surprising source that good barely wins over evil, but you have to see how it all happens for yourself!  There some amazing and funny voices that will have you laughing out loud like Steven Tyler (Polar Express) as Nim Galuu a caterpillar with an attitude; two hysterical buddy's, Aziz Ansari (Parks and Recreation, Ice Age) as Mub a snail and Chris O'Dowd (Brides Maids, Monsters Vs. Aliens) as Grub a slug, who reminded me of Laurel and Hardy in a small way.This movie has lots of action, tons of comedy and more importantly a wonderful message about the importance of family and friends. Doing the right thing for the right reasons can only lead to success, happiness, fulfilling your goals and of course, love. This is a must see for the entire family and definitely something that will ultimately make you feel good when you leave the theatre!

1651680,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B00CWM58WY,Marshall Lord,"[63, 79]","This review is based on going to see ""Epic"" in the cinema with my family.""Epic"" is a beautifully created animated family film based on William Joyce's book ""The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs (Harper Trophy Books). It is rather like a better execution of the same basic idea as ""Arthur & The Invisibles"" except that in this case the whole film is animated where ""Arthur and the invisibles"" had the human-size portions played by real actors and the miniature sections animated. Ironically that means that, this film having a star studded voice cast, several of whom are extremely easy on the eye, the film does not show them as they usually appear: but the characters are so beautifully drawn that you don't really mind.Case in point: the heroine and central character, Mary Katherine (who prefers to be known as MK) is voiced by actress Amanda Seyfried and the queen of the forest, Queen Tara, is voiced by Beyonce Knowles. I imagine one or two dads would much prefer to have seen the ladies concerned rather than animated images for which they provided the voices. But that reaction won't have lasted more than a few seconds after seeing how well their characters were voiced and drawn. Christian Kaplan who did the casting for this film obviously did pick the cast for their voices rather than their appearance, they more than justify the choice.MK is a teenage girl whose mother has recently died. At the start of the film she arrives at the semi-derelict house, on the edge of a forest, where her father, mad scientist Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) lives and studies the fauna of the forest. Bomba had wrecked both his career and his marriage through his obsessive attempts to prove that an ""advanced civilisation"" of tiny people exists in the forest.It probably won't be a spoiler to anyone thinking of going to see this film - certainly not to anyone who has seen the trailer - that Bomba's apparently preposterous theory, which no other human takes seriously, is in fact correct. Nor that his daughter finds herself magically shrunk to the same size as the tiny denizens of the forest - and caught up in the constant war between two factions of forest creatures.Although some of the less intelligent promotional material for this film presents that conflict as a battle between good and evil - and I have seen it wrongly suggested that the battle in the forest might also affect our world as well - the actual presentation in the film is a lot more nuanced than this. One side, led by Queen Tara (Beyonce Knowles) and her ""leaf men"" soldiers, represents growth, the other led by Mandrake (Christoph Waltz) and his ""boggan"" troops represent decay. Children or anyone else who wants to take a simple moral from the film will see Queen Tara's side as representing good while Mandrake is evil, but adults will realise that the life of the forest would actually depend on a balance between the two.Indeed, one of the best things about the film is that the ""bad guy,"" Mandrake, is not cartoonishly and two-dimensionally evil. Like the most dangerous villains in the real world or the best literature Mandrake is all the more formidable as an opponent because he has characteristics which in a ""good guy"" would be recognised as virtues. Instead of going down the all-too-familiar route of presenting the villain as being pathetic, cowardly, and full of hatred even to those closest to him, the film gives Mandrake a lot of the best lines, shows both him and his son and general Dagda (Blake Anderson) leading from the front at various stages of the film, and doesn't show them constantly plotting to betray each other.Other strong and well voiced characters which enrich the film include Ronin (Colin Farrell) the general of the Leaf men, Nod  (Josh Hutcherson), an independent minded young leafman whose dead father had been Ronin's friend, a pair of sometimes charming and sometimes aggravating molluscs,  Mub the slug (Aziz Ansari) and  Grub the snail (Chris O'Dowd), and a glow-worm impresario called Nim Galuu (Steven Tyler) who is also the keeper of the magic scrolls which record everything which goes on in the forest. The film also features the rapper Armando P&eacute;rez, better known by his stage name Pitbull, voicing a frog mafia boss.Every time I go to see a new animated film I think the depiction of the characters, scenery and events could not get any more beautifully done, and every time you get to the next one you realise you were wrong, and this film is yet another visual feast. The plotting is also reasonably tight, keeping your attention, there are plenty of simple jokes for the kids and more sophisticated ones for the adults. It had me laughing at the jokes quite a few times.Not everyone will like this film - some people will see it as far too similar to ""Arthur and the Invisibles"" and others will consider it a bit twee and childish. But I would consider it a very good film for children up to the age of about thirteen - my eleven-year-old daughter certainly loved it - and which adults can enjoy with their kids.",4,Delightful

Tresca ""Talien""","[22, 30]","Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes franchise, was convinced that five photos taken by Elise Wright and Frances Griffiths were pictures of genuine fairies. They later admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. That's the modern-day premise of ""Epic,"" in which Professor Bomba (Jason Sudeikis) has dedicated his life's work - to the exclusion of his family - to proving the existence of fairies.  His theory is that we can't see these fairies because they move out of phase, faster than us (or alternately, we're slower than them).  And so Bomba's estranged daughter, Mary Katherine (Amanda Seyfried) has come home to live with her father.If the fairies weren't real this would be a very short film, so it's not a spoiler to say that they exist. There's a dizzying variety, embodied primarily by two sides; the Leafmen led by Queen Tara (Beyonce Knowles) represent the forces of life and the Boggans led by Mandrake (Christopher Waltz) represent the forces of death.  A special day is nigh: the summer solstice coincides with a full moon, which is the time Queen Tara chooses a successor by passing on a magic pod that will bloom according to its circumstances.  If it grows in the light of the full moon it will empower the darkness, which of course encourages the Boggans to commit a full scale assault.Somewhere along the way, Mary Katherine (MK for short) shrinks down, randomly inserted Nod (Josh Hutcherson) rebels against the more serious Ronin (Colin Farrell), and snail Grub (Chris O'Dowd) and slug Mub (Aziz Ansari) perform a recurring comedy skit.  MK carries most of the film, with the other characters in orbit around her with their throwaway plots (Nod lost his dad and resents Ronin's paternal stance towards him, Mub wants to be a Leafman, Grub has a crush on MK).  But mostly ""Epic"" is a series of epic fight scenes between elf-like leaf warriors and orc-like goblins.""Epic"" does 3D very well. The fight scenes are energetic and the stakes are high; when villains fall off their mount they fall to their death - the film doesn't shy away from this, smearing one Boggan on a windshield - and the action clicks along at a frenetic pace.  But when you strip away the novelty of big vs. little, tree vs. fungus people, ""Epic"" is basically like every other action fantasy film.This doesn't make ""Epic"" bad, but it's not particularly kid-friendly either.  It's pretty to look at, but up close, it's not nearly as exciting as you might have hoped.

1651724,AHF97M45JFCB,B00CWM58WY,ONENEO,"[1, 1]","Blue Sky Studios rarely receives the type of hype that surrounds Pixar/ Disney or DreamWorks yet if you think about it; these guys were around from the beginning.  Their first big CG feature film (Ice Age) came out way back in 2002 and they followed that up with a whole host of Ice Age sequels and spin offs, Horton Hears a Who, Robots, Rio and now Epic.Like Disney&#8217;s Meet the Robinsons and DreamWorks&#8217; Ride of the Guardians before it, Epic is based upon one of William Joyce&#8217;s art-centric books, in this case &#8220;The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs&#8221;.I&#8217;ve got to get the most significant out of the way first- the film is absolutely beautiful.  From textures to particle effects to color pallet and lighting, Epic sets all kinds of benchmarks in the potential of computer generated imaging.  Some of the many forest settings and even the human character models come off as so life-like as to demand a double take to be certain some live action photography hadn&#8217;t been snuck into the piece.  However, lush visuals do not a perfect film make and Epic isn&#8217;t without its flaws but we&#8217;ll get to all that.Epic tells of a lonely human teen MK (Amanda Seyfried), forced to live with her eccentric (but annoyingly goofy) father in the wake of her mother&#8217;s passing who, by a series of events, becomes shrunk by a fairy queen to aid a group of magical forest dwellers in their battle against decay-spreading bad guys called Boggans.Once shrunk down to microscopic proportions, the viewer is introduced to a whole host of standard issue fantasy archetypes: A beautiful queen with a noble heart and magical powers Tara (Beyonc&eacute; Knowles), a veteran warrior Ronin (Collin Farrell) tasked with the tutelage of immature and irresponsible young warrior Nod for MK&#8217;s flirting needs (Josh Hutcherson).  We get attempts of comic relief in the form of a snail and slug tag team voiced by Chris O&#8217;Dowd and Aziz Ansari respectively.  The villains are copy and pasted bad guys (led by Christopher Waltz as Mandrake) and lack any sort of motivation or backstory.  All you need to know is that they represent death and decay while the good guys (the Leafmen) represent growth and renewal.It would be very fair to say that while Epic commits no major crimes across its 103-minute runtime, it also takes no chances and introduces nothing memorable or enduring to the genre either.  Younger viewers will be likely be far more forgiving due to the whimsical nature of the setting and characters but the screenplay really does the film no favors by falling victim to just about every clich&eacute; in the book.  Couple this to the fact that a lack of backstory really leaves countless unanswered questions to ponder.  Among these: Is this struggle of life versus decay limited to this particular forest or are such tiny battling sprites in every forest around the world? How did the Boggans obtain the power of death initially and, while they acknowledge the existence of balance as being crucial, what motivates them to attempt to upset a balance that has presumably existed since the dawn of time.Again, this might be existential ponderings that will never cross the intended demographics&#8217; collective mind but it does contribute to the nagging sensation that this film wasn&#8217;t created out of passion and inspiration so much as it was manufactured; created by committees to hit all the right notes at exactly the right times.  It succeeds, like it should, in a few segments but never does it fully shake the feeling that it&#8217;s all been recycled either.Danny Elfman&#8217;s score isn&#8217;t quite the soaring whimsical composure we&#8217;ve come to expect from him but it is serviceable and an end-credits song from Beyonce&#8217; is entirely forgettable.In all the visuals alone make this one worth checking out and it does bring an hour-and-a-half&#8217;s worth of adventure to the screen with a hardy dose of panache.  Sadly hints of what this one could have been continually make their presence felt and that&#8217;s the real tragedy here.",3,An Attractively Animated Average Adventure,1390435200,"01 23, 2014",2014,4106,"['Blue', 'Sky', 'Studios', 'rarely', 'type', 'hype', 'Pixar/', 'Disney', 'DreamWorks', 'yet', 'think', 'guys', 'were', 'around', 'beginning', 'first', 'big', 'CG', 'feature', 'film', 'Ice', 'Age', 'came', 'out', 'way', 'back', '2002', 'followed', 'up', 'whole', 'host', 'Ice', 'Age', 'sequels', 'spin', 'offs', 'Horton', 'Who', 'Robots', 'Rio', 'now', 'Epic.Like', 'Disney', '8217', 'Meet', 'Robinsons', 'DreamWorks', '8217', 'Ride', 'Guardians', 'Epic', 'based', 'one', 'William', 'Joyce', '8217', 'art-centric', 'books', 'case', '8220', 'Leaf', 'Men', 'Brave', 'Good', 'Bugs', '8221', '.I', '8217', 'got', 'get', 'most', 'significant', 'way', 'first-', 'film', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'textures', 'particle', 'effects', 'color', 'pallet', 'lighting', 'Epic', 'kinds', 'benchmarks', 'potential', 'computer', 'generated', 'imaging', 'many', 'forest', 'settings', 'even', 'human', 'character', 'models', 'come', 'off', 'so', 'life-like', 'demand', 'double', 'take', 'be', 'certain', 'live', 'action', 'photography', 'hadn', '8217', 'been', 'snuck', 'piece', 'However', 'lush', 'visuals', 'do', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'make', 'Epic', 'isn', '8217', 'flaws', '8217', 'get', 'that.Epic', 'tells', 'lonely', 'human', 'teen', 'MK', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'forced', 'live', 'eccentric', 'annoyingly', 'goofy', 'father', 'wake', 'mother', '8217', 'passing', 'who', 'series', 'events', 'becomes', 'shrunk', 'fairy', 'queen', 'aid', 'group', 'magical', 'forest', 'dwellers', 'battle', 'decay-spreading', 'bad', 'guys', 'called', 'Boggans.Once', 'shrunk', 'down', 'microscopic', 'proportions', 'viewer', 'introduced', 'whole', 'host', 'standard', 'issue', 'fantasy', 'archetypes', 'beautiful', 'queen', 'noble', 'heart', 'magical', 'powers', 'Tara', 'Beyonc', 'eacute', 'Knowles', 'veteran', 'warrior', 'Ronin', 'Collin', 'Farrell', 'tasked', 'tutelage', 'immature', 'irresponsible', 'young', 'warrior', 'Nod', 'MK', '8217', 'flirting', 'needs', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'get', 'attempts', 'comic', 'relief', 'form', 'snail', 'slug', 'tag', 'team', 'voiced', 'Chris', 'O', '8217', 'Dowd', 'Aziz', 'Ansari', 'respectively', 'villains', 'are', 'copy', 'pasted', 'bad', 'guys', 'led', 'Christopher', 'Waltz', 'Mandrake', 'sort', 'motivation', 'backstory', 'need', 'know', 'represent', 'death', 'decay', 'good', 'guys', 'Leafmen', 'represent', 'growth', 'renewal.It', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'fair', 'say', 'Epic', 'major', 'crimes', '103-minute', 'runtime', 'also', 'chances', 'introduces', 'nothing', 'memorable', 'enduring', 'genre', 'either', 'Younger', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'likely', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'forgiving', 'due', 'whimsical', 'nature', 'setting', 'characters', 'screenplay', 'really', 'film', 'favors', 'falling', 'victim', 'just', 'clich', 'eacute', 'book', 'Couple', 'fact', 'lack', 'backstory', 'really', 'countless', 'unanswered', 'questions', 'ponder', 'struggle', 'life', 'versus', 'decay', 'limited', 'particular', 'forest', 'are', 'such', 'tiny', 'battling', 'sprites', 'forest', 'world', 'How', 'did', 'Boggans', 'obtain', 'power', 'death', 'initially', 'acknowledge', 'existence', 'balance', 'being', 'crucial', 'what', 'attempt', 'upset', 'balance', 'presumably', 'existed', 'dawn', 'time.Again', 'might', 'be', 'existential', 'ponderings', 'will', 'never', 'cross', 'intended', 'demographics', '8217', 'collective', 'mind', 'contribute', 'nagging', 'sensation', 'film', 'wasn', '8217', 'created', 'passion', 'inspiration', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'manufactured', 'created', 'committees', 'hit', 'right', 'notes', 'exactly', 'right', 'times', 'should', 'few', 'segments', 'never', 'fully', 'shake', 'feeling', '8217', 'been', 'recycled', 'either.Danny', 'Elfman', '8217', 'score', 'isn', '8217', 'quite', 'soaring', 'whimsical', 'composure', '8217', 'come', 'expect', 'serviceable', 'end-credits', 'song', 'Beyonce', '8217', 'entirely', 'forgettable.In', 'visuals', 'alone', 'make', 'one', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'bring', 'hour-and-a-half', '8217', 's', 'worth', 'adventure', 'screen', 'hardy', 'dose', 'panache', 'Sadly', 'hints', 'what', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'continually', 'make', 'presence', 'felt', '8217', 's', 'real', 'tragedy', 'here']",N/A

(Amanda Seyfried-Voice) accidently finds herself in a world where tiny people exist. Once she is turned into one of them she tries to help their home, the forest, become whole again. Along the way she meets some very interesting characters. Will she get back home, or will she permanently have to live in the forest?I absolutely love this film. It has a great plot, and some really great characters. I like how the visuals are outstanding and flawless. The 3-D animation is so wonderful that it makes this film 100 times better in making the forest come alive. The costumes really relate to where the characters are in the forest. The background music is very fitting with the rest of the film. The actors do a remarkable job portraying their characters.I am surprised about how much I love this film. I think everything about this film is great. My favorite character is M.K., because she is very much like me, not in her situation, but the way she acts about everything. I can see myself easily relating to her. My favorite scene is when M.K. is talking to her Dad about how he is not normal and all she wants him to do is be her Dad without all the gadgets and gizmos. This scene is very touching, and teaches us that once in a while you need to be there for your loved ones, but you should also do your own thing.Director Chris Wedge directs a fantastic animated film. Also Writers James V. Hart and William Joyce, along with others, do a good job writing the screenplay. Other great voice-over talents in this film are Colin Farrell, Josh Hutcherson and Beyonc&eacute; Knowles.A couple of messages that are in this film are: 1) Everything happens for a reason and 2) Do not take what you have for granted. Be thankful for everything that you have.I recommend ""Epic"" for ages 5 to 16. It is really one of those films that everyone can watch and enjoy together. There is no content that is inappropriate for younger viewers. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It is truly a wonderful film with amazing animation and great characters.

But it&#8217;s Aziz Ansari, from TV&#8216;s &#8220;Parks and Recreation,&#8220; who steals the show as a sly and snide little slug named Mub.Though less highly acclaimed than a number of more heavily promoted animated features, &#8220;Epic,&#8221; for my money, holds its own with the best of them.

Five adults hovering in front of the Sharp 70"" Quatra, in the darkened room, with sunglasses.  Quite a sight.  BUT, more importantly ages 29 to 64 and we all enjoyed ""Epic"".I tend to not over think the individual flaws of a film, but how it stands as an ensemble.  Sometimes we don't agree with the logic of the story, but in the end, is the important issue is,  was the story well told over all.  Epic qualifies for ""Story Well Told"".""Epic's""  RIO genealogy shows though in the most positive ways.  Beautiful to watch.  Good vs. Evil, etc., and yes Good prevails.  I'm certain all of my grandchildren will love it and their parents will approve.As other have said, the animation is breathtakingly beautiful with amazing attention to detail.  The 3D is NOT ""in your face"" but just enough to gain that extra degree of ""being there"".  It was very tasteful.  This is artful animation, not the CG live-action of Avatar.  The 3D was just right for me, and the family agreed.  The use of foreground vs back ground carried though even into the credits.  KUDOs for being true to the 3D art form.  This is a film you can forget it's in 3D until you turn the 3D off. Then you know it's missing.  Just right...We'll watch it over and over as each batch of kids and grownups circles through the house to watch in 3D or 2D as the groups prefer.It will undoubtedly become a ""standard"" as sure as RIO, Ice Age, Robots, and other BlueSky animated films have.  That reminds me, time to watch Robots again!Thanks BluSky for thinking just enough out of the box.My primary criticisms:  ""What's up with the title""?  No wonder people didn't flock to see it.  Too bad.  Don't let the title put you off.  The film could have just as easily be title"" ""Wonderful"" or ""Enchanting"", which it was for us.  My secondary criticism is the extra features are only on the 2D disk in the set.  Surely the 3D didn't take up that much extra data on the disk, or maybe it did with the exceptional detail.  Furthermore, this is a very complex project and I think there were many opportunities missed in the Extra features.  They weren't the Extras you'll tell your friends about, etc.. like those found on Shrek and some other animated films.  Oh wait!.  Maybe I just figured out why they didn't bother to include them on the 3D disk.Balance your life.

1651825,A3SO4SZPDNW0S3,B00CWM58WY,William Krischke,"[7, 18]","I'm getting tired of reviewing animated children's films and saying ""it's not Pixar"" -- and it's growing irrelevant, as Pixar's last two outings were disappointing.  Nonetheless, that run from Toy Story in '95 to Toy Story 3 in 2010 -- 15 years, 11 classic animated films with a nary a dud in the bunch -- set the bar so high it's impossible NOT to compare everything else to those films. ""Epic"" wants to be classic and grand, strives to be on a level with Pixar, but falls short.  What's interesting is where it falls short. It pretty much nails the epic scenes, the big action pieces. They are exciting and graceful, sometimes approaching breathless. And it looks great, no doubt about that. But ""Epic"" crumbles badly in the in-between scenes, the ones that make the action matter.  The subtle gestures, the ticks of personality, aren't there.  The characters feel thin, like cardboard cutouts or on loan from a stock animation company.  We have the gruff protector who struggles to express his love for anybody or anything.  The reckless but talented young buck who butts heads with him, but does the right thing when the chips are down. The Abbott and Costello sidekicks (a slug and a snail.) The wise man who doesn't know half as much as he pretends to and is kind of a slob, but once again, gets it done when everything's on the line.But the worst of the bunch is the villain.  Christoph Waltz voices the character, and that ought to be a casting jackpot - Waltz was one of the most chilling villains of recent years in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" (as well as an equally chilling good guy in last year's ""Django Unchained"") but the writers and directors of ""Epic"" have no idea what to do with him.  Frankly, I'm not sure Christoph Waltz is anything special outside of Tarantino's writing and pacing.  He excels gloriously in those slow, tortuously suspenseful, dialogue-heavy scenes that nobody but Tarantino seem to get right.Actually, I felt a bit sorry for the bad guy, whose name is Mandrake.  He's the ruler of a kingdom of rot and decay, diametrically opposed to the kingdom of life and growth ruled by Queen Tara and her Leaf Men.  Tara is voiced by Beyonc&eacute;, who, with her distinctive urban/ ghetto accent, seems like a weird choice for Queen of the Forest, but whatever.  Early in the action, Mandrake's oafish son is killed by a Leaf Man, and apparently reproduction is extremely difficult for tiny creatures of the forest, because Queen Tara has one chance in a hundred years to produce an heir, by picking a water-lily pod and making sure it blooms in the moonlight.  So Mandrake decides to steal the pod, make sure it blooms in the dark, and thus claim the progeny as his own.  So basically, the bad guy is just looking to replace his dead son. That's not so terribly evil and villainous, is it?The first half hour is annoying and laborious first dominated by clunky exposition and a terrible performance from Jason Sudeikis as the only big person who believes that Leaf Men exist.  He is clumsy and dorky and hare-brained; basically Rick Moranis from ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" minus any of the charisma and cuteness Moranis brought to that role.  But once all the exposition, and all the big people, are out of the way, ""Epic"" picks up steam and moves from painful to pleasing.  That's because the characters stop talking and start swooping around on hummingbirds and stuff.  It looks good, it moves great, but it somehow lacks that sense of enchantment that it so desperately needs to really succeed.  At one point (during the laborious first half hour) I found myself wishing they had just made little action figures, with their leaf outfits and saddled birds, and let the kids loose in the forest with them.  A couple of 7 year olds could come up with a fresher, more exciting and intriguing story than the one on the screen.I'm not sure the plot even makes sense -- the more I try to write about it, the less I find I understand. To put it briefly, Seyfried gets shrunk down to leaf man size, the queen dies, the pod gets stolen, and a motley crew of adventurers set off on an epic quest to save the forest.  Life lessons are learned, young folks fall in love, relationships are restored, and long-hidden emotions are finally expressed.There's just way too much going on here, leaving us little time to enjoy or explore the tiny world of the leaf men and their adversaries, or to feel like we know and care about the characters.  Watching it, I got the feeling that the producers and animators spent the majority of their time and resources on the action scenes, and then hurriedly wrote and drew the scenes in between them. That's not the way you tell an epic story.  That's the way you make a big, busy, beautiful but ultimately heartless and empty summer blockbuster.  To put it succintly, ""Epic"" isn't.If you're all excited about seeing an animated flick about tiny people, let me recommend a much better movie - last year's overlooked and underrated ""The Secret World of Arrietty,"" from Studio Ghibli, creators of kids' classics like ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Spirited Away."" ""Arrietty's"" not quite up to that level, but it's a much more carefully crafted tale, and captures the wonder and magic of being six inches tall in a world made for much bigger

The story may not be wholly original as it blends in elements from older and more familiar stories/movies but I thought that it was a decent effort and the animation was incredibly well-done. The story focuses on a young human teenager, Mary Katherine or MK  (voiced by Amanda Seyfried) as she prefers to be known. Having recently suffered the loss of her mother, MK travels to an isolated spot to live with her father, who is a bit of a loner and eccentric. MK's father has devoted his life to discovering the existence of a group of advanced little people who appear to be related to the fae. This race of small folk is made up of a Queen named Tara (voiced by Beyonce), guards called Leaf Men led by Ronin (voiced by Colin Farrell), and who are at war with a group of bugs called Boggans led by Mandrake (voiced by Christoph Waltz).The story deals with what happens when the little people lose their beloved leader. MK, who is at odds with her father over his single-minded pursuit of the little people, finds herself confused when a strange event shrinks her to the size of the little folk. Together with Ronin and several other characters, namely a ne'er do well and two oddball snails, the group embark on a mission to save the forest before it is engulfed in darkness and destroyed by Mandrake and his cronies.The pacing is good throughout the movie, and none of us felt bored during the movie. To be sure, this is one of those fantasy-themed films that requires one to suspend belief for the duration, and accept the movie for what it is - a cool and interesting  fantasy movie that has beautiful animation and an engaging story that will appeal to young children and adults. Just a note though, there are some sequences in the film featuring the ugly Boggans acting in a menacing manner which might be a little scary for the very young (toddlers and under) but on the whole, there is not much to find fault with.",4,A fun family-friendly story with great animation effects,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2064,"['watched', 'husband', 'eight-year-old', 'recently', 'dollar', 'theater', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'were', 'entertained', 'story', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'wholly', 'original', 'elements', 'older', 'more', 'familiar', 'stories/movies', 'thought', 'was', 'decent', 'effort', 'animation', 'was', 'incredibly', 'well-done', 'story', 'young', 'human', 'teenager', 'Mary', 'Katherine', 'MK', 'voiced', 'Amanda', 'Seyfried', 'be', 'known', 'Having', 'recently', 'suffered', 'loss', 'mother', 'MK', 'isolated', 'spot', 'live', 'father', 'who', 'bit', 'loner', 'eccentric', 'MK', 'father', 'devoted', 'life', 'discovering', 'existence', 'group', 'advanced', 'little', 'people', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'related', 'fae', 'race', 'small', 'folk', 'made', 'Queen', 'named', 'Tara', 'voiced', 'Beyonce', 'guards', 'called', 'Leaf', 'Men', 'led', 'Ronin', 'voiced', 'Colin', 'Farrell', 'who', 'are', 'war', 'group', 'bugs', 'called', 'Boggans', 'led', 'Mandrake', 'voiced', 'Christoph', 'Waltz', '.The', 'story', 'deals', 'what', 'when', 'little', 'people', 'lose', 'beloved', 'leader', 'MK', 'who', 'odds', 'father', 'single-minded', 'pursuit', 'little', 'people', 'confused', 'when', 'strange', 'event', 'size', 'little', 'folk', 'Together', 'Ronin', 'several', 'other', 'characters', 'namely', ""ne'er"", 'do', 'well', 'two', 'oddball', 'snails', 'group', 'embark', 'mission', 'save', 'forest', 'engulfed', 'darkness', 'destroyed', 'Mandrake', 'cronies.The', 'pacing', 'good', 'movie', 'none', 'felt', 'bored', 'movie', 'be', 'sure', 'one', 'fantasy-themed', 'films', 'one', 'suspend', 'belief', 'duration', 'movie', 'what', 'cool', 'interesting', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'engaging', 'story', 'will', 'appeal', 'young', 'children', 'adults', 'Just', 'note', 'are', 'sequences', 'film', 'featuring', 'ugly', 'Boggans', 'acting', 'menacing', 'manner', 'might', 'be', 'little', 'scary', 'very', 'young', 'toddlers', 'whole', 'not', 'much', 'find', 'fault']",N/A
