848560,A2VMT89TCSF105,B0002WZRVS,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[2, 2]","""Helter Skelter"" is a 2004 American movie about the Manson Family and the gruesome Tate-LaBiance murders. I'm somewhat ambivalent towards it. On the one hand, the acting is supreme. On the other hand, however, it reminds me of a disjointed documentary rather than a ""real"" movie. I'm not sure if somebody who doesn't know anything about the Manson cult will become any wiser after seeing it. I filled in the gaps in my knowledge by reading Wikipedia entries!Jeremy Davies, who stars Charles Manson, is convincing as cult leader and crazy clown. If this is how the real Manson acted like, I don't know, but it's very convincing in its own right. So is the character Susan Atkins, who looks and speaks exactly as I imagine a brain-washed and mad cultist to look and speak like. A stereotype? Perhaps, but still convincing in its own right. Of course, the real star of the show is Linda Kasabian (starred by Clea DuVall), another strong performance.As for the negatives, ""Helter Skelter"" never *really* explains Charles Manson's apocalyptic scenario (the Helter Skelter of the movie title). We get it presented in small pieces at a time, and some references are left unclear, for instance the notion of the ""bottomless pit"". While Manson's philosophy was, of course, barking mad, it did seem to have a certain inner logic and consistency. ""Helter Skelter"" takes a kind of outsider perspective on Manson's motives, portraying him and the Family as completely incomprehensible. You almost get the impression that Manson ordered the killings to get even with the Beach Boys!The latter half of the film is so disjointed that it almost gets boring to watch, despite the interesting (if that's the word for it) subject matter. It feels almost as a entirely different movie.In the end, I'll give ""Helter Skelter"" three stars.",3,Helter Bloody Skelter,1312502400,"08 5, 2011",2011,1815,"['Helter', 'Skelter', '2004', 'American', 'movie', 'Manson', 'Family', 'gruesome', 'Tate-LaBiance', 'murders', ""'m"", 'somewhat', 'ambivalent', 'towards', 'one', 'hand', 'acting', 'supreme', 'other', 'hand', 'however', 'disjointed', 'documentary', 'rather', 'real', 'movie', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'somebody', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'Manson', 'cult', 'will', 'become', 'wiser', 'seeing', 'filled', 'gaps', 'knowledge', 'reading', 'Wikipedia', 'entries', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'who', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'convincing', 'cult', 'leader', 'crazy', 'clown', 'how', 'real', 'Manson', 'acted', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'very', 'convincing', 'own', 'right', 'character', 'Susan', 'Atkins', 'who', 'exactly', 'imagine', 'brain-washed', 'mad', 'cultist', 'look', 'speak', 'stereotype', 'Perhaps', 'still', 'convincing', 'own', 'right', 'course', 'real', 'star', 'show', 'Linda', 'Kasabian', 'starred', 'Clea', 'DuVall', 'strong', 'performance.As', 'negatives', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'never', '*really*', 'explains', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'apocalyptic', 'scenario', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'movie', 'title', 'get', 'presented', 'small', 'pieces', 'time', 'references', 'are', 'left', 'unclear', 'instance', 'notion', 'bottomless', 'pit', 'Manson', 'philosophy', 'was', 'course', 'barking', 'mad', 'did', 'seem', 'have', 'certain', 'inner', 'logic', 'consistency', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'kind', 'outsider', 'perspective', 'Manson', 'motives', 'portraying', 'Family', 'completely', 'incomprehensible', 'almost', 'get', 'impression', 'Manson', 'ordered', 'killings', 'get', 'even', 'Beach', 'Boys', 'latter', 'half', 'film', 'so', 'disjointed', 'almost', 'boring', 'watch', 'interesting', 'word', 'subject', 'matter', 'almost', 'entirely', 'different', 'movie.In', 'end', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'three', 'stars']",N/A

848564,A30N4CJVI6U4XE,B0002WZRVS,"Chris Wilson ""Chris Kent""","[28, 28]","The 2004 made-for-TV version of ""Helter Skelter"" certainly received harsh treatment from both professional and amateur critics alike. This is not particularly surprising, considering the ghoulish subject manner and the intense sensibilities in relation to this legendary crime. Going into this film my expectations were low. While watching the DVD version, which included a variety of violent scenes not shown during its original TV broadcast, I was surprised to discover this was a quality production.This new perspective of ""Helter Skelter"" is probably the best film ever made about this lurid tale, and Jeremy Davies' thoughtful performance as Charles Manson comes about as close to the truth as we are ever going to get. For the most part, the filmmakers had their facts straight. I rolled my eyes throughout several miscalculations, most notably the elimination of the murder of Spahn Ranch employee Shorty Shea. Granted, there's only a certain amount of information this film could pack into its busy two-plus hours running time, but Shorty was a known victim of this hippie-creepy cult - a human being murdered in the dead of night. If you're going to tell this story yet again (and the question as to whether it was necessary would require an entirely new post), don't eliminate victims simply to create a prime time package for mass consumption.In addition, the meeting of Charles Manson and Sharon Tate is disputed to this day. While Manson most definitely visited the Tate property prior to the murders, the filmmakers' choice to have them meet eye-to-eye was tacky. That being said, there was an honest attempt by the filmmakers to portray the conditions that led this family of psychotic youths to commit such horrible murders in 1969.""Helter Skelter"" was not gritty enough for my taste, as the Spahn Ranch commune was far more picturesque than the horse fly-covered, greasy-haired reality. Manson and his clan are portrayed as humans rather than demons, and I suppose if we are going to understand this subject matter, this difficult truth should be emphasized.Casting Clea DuVall as the controversial Linda Kasabian was an excellent move. Not only is DuVall one of the finest actresses of her generation (and her performance rivals Davies'), but Kasabian was just about the only member of Manson's Family to show remorse following the murders. If you are going to find a single glimmer of hope in this tawdry epic, Kasabian is about as close as you are going to get to sunshine.""Helter Skelter"" essentially follows her journey as a member of Manson's Family, from introduction to drug-induced indoctrination, eventually leading to the nights of murder. Historically, Kasabian left the Manson clan soon after the crimes, was arrested and became one of the few members to give testimony during the grueling trials.The original ""Helter Skelter"" (1976) has always been a bit overrated, with Steve Railsback giving an over-the-top, circus-like performance as Manson. The film emphasized the investigation and devoted a couple of hours to the trial itself. This new version is a companion film, if you will, detailing the year leading up to the arrests and trial, abruptly ending about the time Kasabian decides she will testify, thus insuring the killers will be convicted.The Tate and LaBianca murders are portrayed more-or-less realistically. There's really nothing shown TV viewers do not witness on the ""CSI"" and ""Criminal Minds"" programs. But these atrocities actually took place, and perhaps that haunting fact makes for uncomfortable viewing. I certainly wanted to turn my eyes away, and was disturbed by the amount of blood shown. This is absolutely R-rated subject matter, but prime time crime produces high ratings. So who am I to question modern-day TV sensibilities?When reading about the Manson crimes - books which are equal parts fascinating and repulsive - one almost always asks ""Why?"" This new film version of ""Helter Skelter,"" factually close to the truth, with better performances and production values than this subject deserves, attempts to answer nagging questions.

848566,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,B0002WZRVS,Doug Park,"[1, 2]","After seeing the 1976 version of HELTER SKELTER directed by Tom Gries, which focuses more on the investigation and trial of the Manson ""family"" than on the crimes themselves, I thought ""It would be interesting if someone made a film which focuses on the 'family' rather than the prosecutor and actually dramatizes out the murders.""That's exactly what John Gray did here. HELTER SKELTER (2004) provides an in-depth look at the Manson ""family,"" using Linda Kasabian as a frequent focal-point. It also gives some illustration of the wacko theories that Manson and certain of his followers developed in order to justify the Hinman, Tate, LaBianca, and other murders, shows the crimes themselves in front-story (rather than the brief flashbacks the '76 film showed), along with giving a new perspective on the trials and aftermaths.I've noticed some complaints that certain details of the crimes, as well as Manson's whole ""Helter Skelter"" theory, were misrepresented or missed altogether. As one of many long-time obsessives with the Manson murders, I can only say that the creators of this film really strove to be as accurate as possible, right up to details such as a bloody towel inadvertently landing on Jay Sebring's face and being interpreted as a symbolic ""hood."" It would be well-nigh impossible to capture every detail (some of which are not terribly important for our purposes today) of the murders or to explain/reveal all the justifications (which are themselves subject to disagreement) that the ""family"" used for committing these horrible acts. This being a drama rather than a documentary, too much analysis of Manson's motives would become quite ponderous after a while.That being said, there ARE one or two rather vague, fluffy scenes. I also read a comment somewhere by former Manson associate Bobby Beausoleil, still incarcerated for the Hinman murder, who, after watching this film, stated something to the effect that, had Manson been anywhere near as obvious a megalomaniacal creep as the one shown in this film, none of his ""family"" would ever have had anything to do with him. A fair statement, but again, perfectly capturing Manson's personality and his interactions with his accomplices would be virtually impossible.All things considered, this was a very hard and complicated story to pack into 137 DVD minutes, and the creators did a commendable job of choosing what/what-not to show. The acting by virtually all the major players here is quite good, often outstanding. I also like the way that the police, Bugliosi, and the other prosecutors are not represented as the completely squeaky-clean paragons of virtue that they were in the '76 HELTER SKELTER. There will always be those who are dissatisfied with how certain actual people and events are portrayed, especially when it comes to people they actually knew (or were) and events in which they actually took part. Some oversimplication is inevitable. But I repeat, it would be hard to recreate the Helter Skelter murders with a higher degree of accuracy than this film does, and anyone with the remotest interest should find HELTER SKELTER (04) fascinating.",4,Riveting Murder Drama,1359676800,"02 1, 2013",2013,3138,"['seeing', '1976', 'version', 'HELTER', 'SKELTER', 'directed', 'Tom', 'Gries', 'more', 'investigation', 'trial', 'Manson', 'family', 'crimes', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'someone', 'made', 'film', ""'family"", 'rather', 'prosecutor', 'actually', 'out', 'murders', 'exactly', 'what', 'John', 'Gray', 'did', 'here', 'HELTER', 'SKELTER', '2004', 'in-depth', 'look', 'Manson', 'family', 'using', 'Linda', 'Kasabian', 'frequent', 'focal-point', 'also', 'illustration', 'wacko', 'theories', 'Manson', 'certain', 'followers', 'developed', 'order', 'justify', 'Hinman', 'Tate', 'LaBianca', 'other', 'murders', 'crimes', 'front-story', 'rather', 'brief', ""'76"", 'film', 'showed', 'giving', 'new', 'perspective', 'trials', 'aftermaths.I', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'complaints', 'certain', 'details', 'crimes', 'as', 'well', 'Manson', 'whole', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'theory', 'were', 'misrepresented', 'missed', 'altogether', 'one', 'many', 'long-time', 'obsessives', 'Manson', 'murders', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'creators', 'film', 'really', 'strove', 'be', 'as', 'accurate', 'possible', 'right', 'up', 'details', 'such', 'bloody', 'towel', 'inadvertently', 'landing', 'Jay', 'Sebring', 'face', 'being', 'interpreted', 'symbolic', 'hood', 'would', 'be', 'well-nigh', 'impossible', 'capture', 'detail', 'are', 'not', 'terribly', 'important', 'purposes', 'today', 'murders', 'explain/reveal', 'justifications', 'are', 'subject', 'disagreement', 'family', 'used', 'committing', 'horrible', 'acts', 'being', 'drama', 'rather', 'documentary', 'too', 'much', 'analysis', 'Manson', 'motives', 'would', 'become', 'quite', 'ponderous', 'while.That', 'being', 'said', 'ARE', 'one', 'two', 'rather', 'vague', 'fluffy', 'scenes', 'also', 'read', 'comment', 'somewhere', 'former', 'Manson', 'associate', 'Bobby', 'Beausoleil', 'still', 'incarcerated', 'Hinman', 'murder', 'who', 'watching', 'film', 'stated', 'something', 'effect', 'had', 'Manson', 'been', 'anywhere', 'as', 'obvious', 'megalomaniacal', 'creep', 'one', 'shown', 'film', 'none', 'family', 'would', 'ever', 'have', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'fair', 'statement', 'again', 'perfectly', 'capturing', 'Manson', 'personality', 'interactions', 'accomplices', 'would', 'be', 'virtually', 'impossible.All', 'things', 'considered', 'was', 'very', 'hard', 'complicated', 'story', 'pack', '137', 'DVD', 'minutes', 'creators', 'did', 'commendable', 'job', 'choosing', 'what/what-not', 'show', 'acting', 'virtually', 'major', 'players', 'here', 'quite', 'good', 'often', 'outstanding', 'also', 'way', 'police', 'Bugliosi', 'other', 'prosecutors', 'are', 'not', 'represented', 'completely', 'squeaky-clean', 'paragons', 'virtue', 'were', ""'76"", 'HELTER', 'SKELTER', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'who', 'are', 'dissatisfied', 'how', 'certain', 'actual', 'people', 'events', 'are', 'portrayed', 'especially', 'when', 'people', 'actually', 'knew', 'were', 'events', 'actually', 'took', 'part', 'oversimplication', 'inevitable', 'repeat', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'recreate', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'murders', 'higher', 'degree', 'accuracy', 'film', 'anyone', 'remotest', 'interest', 'should', 'find', 'HELTER', 'SKELTER', '04', 'fascinating']",N/A
848567,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B0002WZRVS,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 2]","HELTER SKELTEREvery one knows what happened with the whole Manson family thing and every one knows the story, so why would you see this film? The answer is with out a doubt for the lead performance by Jeremy Davies, he deserved an Oscar in my opinion TV movie or not. For those who do not remember there was a film of the same name done much earlier but it focused more on the trial as this one focuses more on the family. This is actually a really good movie with some outstanding performances by the whole cast. When this was released on DVD as the director's cut I scooped it right up and put it in.Unlike the first film this one focuses more on the actual family and follows them as they go from pulling pranks to killing people. I really don't have to say much because every one knows what happened back then. Manson really was good at manipulating people and got all these people to follow. So the story goes that after a chance meeting in which Manson did not find the beach boy he was looking for, he found ""some movie stars"". So in his words to jump start some race war that was supposedly going based on a Beatles song he sent his flunkies over to kill those stars. The most famous of the victims from the Tate/ LaBianca murders being Sharon Tate, the wife of legendary film maker Roman Polanski.I am sure you all know the story so there really is no need to go into that whole deal, I am sure you all know. What you may not know is that Jeremy Davies gives a very Oscar worthy performance at least to me, he is very much this character. It is the little things that he does that you may not even notice the first time you watch it but look closely and watch this master in his craft. In the special features it shows footage of him rehearsing the character and he is insane, excellent performance. If there ever was a guy that looked and acted like Manson it is this guy here, masterful performance.Writer/director John Gray did an excellent job on this film and really made it feel real, even with the restrictions of being a made for TV movie. When you watch this film you will not be thinking of this as such, it feels like a real theatrical flick. All of the actors in this are excellent from the Manson girls to the detectives that brought them down. This really is a well put together film and that may be one of the best TV flicks of all time in my opinion. There are some other good ones out there but as far as TV standards go this is a classic in my opinion. I would have loved to see this same exact team go all out on a theatrical no holds barred version, now that would be interesting.This DVD comes with some excellent footage of Davis rehearsing the Manson character and  one of the best commentaries I have listened to.

And he doesn't even have a Public Relations Firm working for him.  Pretty impressive, Charlie.  So, as for the movie.  I like it, mainly for the strange portrayal of Charles Manson who is, let's face it, strange to say the least.  I like the Jeremy Davies' interpretation of America's most notorious Svengali and orchestrator of at least two very gruesome and very public mass murders.  As for historical accuracy; who knows what Manson really said to these impressionable young people who carried out his wicked, murderous instructions?  I liked the portrayal of Manson and other real life figures such as Dennis Wilson and Terry Melcher.  Sharon Tate was so beautiful in real life that it would be difficult to find someone who could equal her physicality; but the actress who plays her does an adequate job, especially when she gets a glimpse of Manson when he comes to the door searching for Terry Melcher.  Hey, let's face it; you may think he is evil and even repulsive; but the man, Manson, continues to  fascinate still, after all these years.  Anyway, maybe it wasn't necessary to remake this movie.  The first made for television film was actually quite good though it did take a different approach to the material.  Also, why bother to remake this material into a film after all these years?

The script is a general overview of Vincent Bugliosi's Helter Skelter book. A more in-depth film is needed. There is so much more to the whole Manson saga best described in Greg King's book "" Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders "" Both Voyteck Frykowski & Abigail Folger were heavily into the Hollywood drug scene Frykowski was a well known dealer and may have had dealings with Manson. Leno LaBianca, according to first wife Alice could be hot tempered. A former military man he disliked hippies. At one time Manson and 2 of his girls tried to move in 3 houses away from the LaBiancas and caused a ruckus in the Los Feliz areas. LaBianca was a WWII military policeman and according to Alice may have had a run in with Manson several weeks before the murders. Jay Sebring never got over losing Sharon to Roman Polanski and bravely put himself between Sharon and Tex Watson when he took aim at her. One of his nephews was on television not long ago with Debra Tate. His family should be proud of Jay. Poor Sharon was the ultimate innocent victim. She never could have seen Manson's coming. Among the many inaccuracies in this film was the meeting between Voyteck Frykowski & Sharon at the house before the murders. This never happened. Manson claims to have met Sharon in 1967 at Beach Boy Dennis Wilson's house but this has never been proven. Another inaccuracy was Sharon's relationship with Voyteck Frykowski. She did not like Frykowski & did not want him at the house, although Sharon did become friends with Abigail Folger who according to Greg King was about to leave him due to his drug dealing. One day the whole Manson saga will be told by a film producer who is willing to do the in-depth story this horrible tragedy deserves. 2009 is the 40th anniversary if the Tate-Labianca murders, no doubt we will see much media attention to it.

Actor Steve Railback portrayed the killer, Charles Manson so effectively.This film dramatized the horrific and gruesome murders that a deranged Charles Manson and his young ""followers"" committed, including the death of actress Sharon Tate (The Beverly Hillbillies: The Official Second Season) who was pregnant at the time and the daughter of the CEO of Folger's Coffee, in August 9, 1969.  The second part of this 1976 film contained courtroom scenes that were taken directly from the real court transcripts.  It was here where most viewers remember the cold eye-fixing stare that Steve Railsback gave in the courtroom scene that Charles Manson actually would do in the courtroom.  Steve Railsback ""acting"" as Serial Murderer Charles Manson is the best performance above any other actor.There was also a 1970 film,The Helter-Skelter Murdersthat was banned from the State of California at the time.  This black & white film contained graphic nudity and the inappropriate behavior of Manson (played by Brain Klinknett) and his ""followers"".  Most haunting is the highly detailed and gruesome re-enactment of the murders, some filmed at the actual locations.Now we have this new network television-movie ""Helter Skelter"".  This version will focus on how Manson (played by Jeremy Davies) treated his young ""followers"".  Some actually believed Manson was ""Jesus"". (He is not Jesus) It also depicts how Manson wanted a recording contract to sing his song and how he meet record producer Terry Melcher (son of Doris Day) through Dennis Wilson, a drummer for The Beach Boys.  Melcher visited the ranch (once an old movie set) where Manson had been illegally living at with his followers.  The contract was never to be.  Manson was only a low-life hippie inexperienced at the music business. When Charles Manson began to show more angry behavior, it was thought Manson began looking for them. Terry Melcher and Dennis Wilson had moved eleswhere by then. Charles Manson's behavior is his own fault.  His young followers became like him, thought like him. Manson enjoyed murdering others and seeing pain and liked to get other young people to kill with him.Charles Manson was captured twice and after a historic California court case was put away in prison for life.  He is still alive, now aged, and is denied parole every time. Lynette Squeaky Fromme , who also pointed a gun at President Gerald Ford in 1975, was released from prison, August 14, 2009.Terry Melcher became an executive producer and assisted in his mother's television series'The Doris Day Show: The Complete Collection, Seasons 1-5and charitable projects.This television film came out so untimely, as at the time of broadcast, Terry Melcher was ill with cancer.  He passed away November 19, 2004.You can read more about Doris Day and included Terry Melcher's story of Charles Manson in the book,Doris Day: Her Own StoryThis DVD version contains scenes not shown on broadcast television.The mastermind and serial killer, Charles Manson is still in prison and will never get parole. His other ""followers"" are also still in prison for taking part in the killings.Steve Grogan was released from prison in 1985.Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme was released from prison in 2009 after serving time for trying to shoot and kill President Gerald R.

It's a closer look at Charlie and the Family, more comprehensive in covering the various events that happened, a refreshing departure from the original, which was based closely on the book.  Exceptional performances were Jeremy Davies as Manson, so good that he's unrecognizable as the geeky doofus in Saving Private Ryan.  Allison Smith playing Patricia Krenwinkel was particularly good because her presence was very eerie, will make your skin crawl.  And Marguerite Moreau who played Susan Atkins was notable because of that characters' non-chalant, ho-hum attitude about such grisly murders.  Another good point is more attention paid to the events that were key to what made it all happen - the breakdown between Charlie, Dennis Wilson, and Terry Melcher.  Except it was too brief.  All accounts of the story are clear that Manson's rage and descent into a murderous maelstrom began when the Beach Boys used one of his songs without permission and was ingloriously turned away by Melcher (producer for Capitol Records).  Another disappointment was Linda Kasabian being the centerpiece of this film.  The real Tex Watson, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten are alive and would have gladly provided their stories.  Yet another was production sets and the soundtrack; it gave a peculiar contemporary feel whereas the 1976 version was unmistakably life as it was in 1969.  Still another was its odd ending; it was too sudden, as if it needed something else to close more smoothly.

In this case I saw this version before I read the reviews. After reading the bad reviews here I am literally wondering if they were thinking of a different movie. I put this film on at around 4:30am just wanting to preview it. I had already had a long night. But instead I sat through the entire thing until 7am. I was enthralled from start to finish! The film was well detailed, accurate to the actual events, had (superb acting by nearly all the actors), was realistic, terrifying, violent, bloody, and it told a very convincing version of the story. Jeremy Davies as Manson was nothing short of heart stopping. He nailed the role and becomes the closest any actor has ever come to portraying the way Manson really was in the 60's. The film delves much deeper into the lives of the cult and their living enviroment than the 70's TV version did. Numerous people who wrote reviews here complained that there wasn't enough time spent on the court room proceedings in this version. But they clearly missed the point. That film was already done. This one was aimed at the activities of the manson family before, during, and after the murders. These people were expecting a court room drama, but that is not what this film was meant to be. But yes indeed this film has court room segments. A lot of it. So what were they complaining about? Personally I felt this was the best film ever made about the Manson family and the murders.

848589,AWJKA0TRZLZGS,B0002WZRVS,Thomas Bailey,"[48, 51]","Most of you know - as it is mentioned in several of the reviews - that there are two Helter Skelters: One Made in 1976, and the other made in 2004.Is one better than the other? Is either even worth watching or buying?As is true, much of the time, when it comes to a remake - some will say the original is the best, and the new one is terrible (should have been left well enough alone); at least one says the actor playing Charles Manson is absolutely horrible.The truth is that they are both very different movies. Similarities: Both were made for TV. Differences: 1. The 1976 version is told more from the side of solving the case, putting the pieces together, the trial, and the attorneys (more a story about Vincent Bugliosi and his challenges in dealing with this ordeal). Manson seems to be almost stuck in there as if some sort of collage or montage. In some ways, the actor playing Manson doesn't have much to do but just be there - I never really got where I could understand how he was able to control or manipulate his so-called family into doing those demented things he got them to do. There are moments though he does shine. The killings are presented in more of a telling by Linda, a member of the family, in a surrealistic-style blended in a sort-of-montage into her crying face. This entire TV movie, in some ways, is like watching an old Dragnet TV episode: The following is a dramatization, and the names have been protected to change the innocent; so you are being told the story, with a narrative introducing different parts. To me, it seems very flat in many ways. The acting is very flat-but there are some good moments, and some very good performances. There are places where the Helter Skelter Philosophy is explained much more clearly and thoroughly than in the new one. 2. The 2004 version is told more as an actual experience, and from the side of Manson. This was done deliberately-as is explained in the commentary-to show more from the side of Manson and his Family than what the 1976 version did. The actor playing Manson is quite good and disturbing at times; I could feel the power and control he had more than in the older version; the commentary helped explain this as well. He comes across as being more intelligent and capable of leading and controlling than he does in the older one. No denying that he is loony in both of them-but in the new one he is loony and powerful and dangerous and completely out of touch, but in touch in a way as well (he is able to see into people. He is able to use that. This is explained in the commentary). There is a surrealistic approach in the way the killings are shown here as well - but here it is more like being an observer of these strange, bizarre acts, than an observer of one remembering and telling of these strange, bizarre acts. I found myself questioning, at times, the actor playing Manson's performance: Did Manson really talk like that? Talking in a breathy, eerie manner? Talk as if he is putting on a constant performance? This could be a shortcoming of the actor, or a shortcoming of Manson. I remember seeing, a long time ago, a documentary (and reading it as well) that Manson would practice facial expressions (it was as if there was nothing beneath the surface of expression, just an emptiness), and in the documentary you could see him, while he was on trial, walking down the hall, and his face going through the changes of different expressions without any reason for them to be there at all. So, it's possible that in those moments that the actor might seem bad - he isn't really bad at all. I haven't gotten all the way through the commentary, so I don't know whether or not that is mentioned.I basically think that both TV movies compliment each other. The new one is like a prequel to the other. It sure wouldn't hurt to own both. There are some differences that may make you wonder what the real truth is. Since we all see through our own mind filters and perceptions, we might wonder how true the original book both of these are based on is.Neither of the two is flawless. Both have their negatives and positives. If you can afford both, buy both. You want only one: Buy the 2004 version; at least you have an insightful commentary.

848590,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B0002WZRVS,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[0, 0]","Jeremy Davies is one of the quirkiest actors working today. His strange cadence and his breathless intonations make for some strange experiences and he is fortunate that he has managed to avoid playing exclusively serial killers. Like Brad Dourif, he has a creepy stare and purposeful method that is just too off-putting to play romantic leads, which did not stop him from being one of the best and most sympathetic characters on Lost. Still, even when he is in car commercials, there is a Manson vibe going.So the director must have been very happy to cast him in this movie. Without him, the movie might be three stars or even two stars since it falls into cliches and it still has to pay attention to the book which is about the trial. Other characters are pretty flat and there are too many subplots.Yet, Jeremy Davies captures quite a bit of the essence of Charles Manson as a man who is always performing for an audience, who can be alternately affectionate, charismatic and scary. He's the kind of guy that you meet at a party who seems really cool and interesting and only after talking to him for a little bit do you want to get away from him and never talk to him again. What makes Davies' performance so great is the fact that he never relies on the fact that he is Charles Manson and that we all know that he's a nutcase. He plays Manson with the energy of someone who wants what he wants and does everything to get it. Whether he is just showing up at a Beach Boy's guest house to threaten him or he is deluding himself into thinking that his musical career will take off, he is extremely compelling and I could just watch him being Manson the entire movie. In fact, he is one of the few actors to convey the charisma that made people want to join up with Manson in the first place.The movie wisely uses the main witness in the trial for the perspective character. You get to see her joining the commune to get away from her husband and giving up her possessions in a way that would be very intrusive but seems like a good idea at the time. She is seduced by Manson and then she gets more into things and finds out that she doesn't want to be there anymore. I would have liked more exploration of her character and choices (it does seem to gibe too well with the woman's self-justifying story) but she does work well as a perspective since you get to see the charisma and the discomfort with many of the other cult members.",4,Jeremy Davies nails it,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2014,2436,"['Jeremy', 'Davies', 'one', 'quirkiest', 'actors', 'working', 'today', 'strange', 'cadence', 'breathless', 'intonations', 'make', 'strange', 'experiences', 'fortunate', 'managed', 'avoid', 'playing', 'exclusively', 'serial', 'killers', 'Brad', 'Dourif', 'creepy', 'stare', 'purposeful', 'method', 'just', 'too', 'off-putting', 'play', 'romantic', 'leads', 'did', 'not', 'stop', 'being', 'one', 'best', 'most', 'sympathetic', 'characters', 'Lost', 'Still', 'even', 'when', 'car', 'commercials', 'Manson', 'vibe', 'going.So', 'director', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'happy', 'cast', 'movie', 'movie', 'might', 'be', 'three', 'stars', 'even', 'two', 'stars', 'cliches', 'still', 'pay', 'attention', 'book', 'trial', 'Other', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'flat', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'subplots.Yet', 'Jeremy', 'Davies', 'quite', 'bit', 'essence', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'man', 'who', 'always', 'performing', 'audience', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'alternately', 'affectionate', 'charismatic', 'scary', 'kind', 'guy', 'meet', 'party', 'who', 'really', 'cool', 'interesting', 'only', 'talking', 'little', 'bit', 'do', 'want', 'get', 'away', 'never', 'talk', 'again', 'What', 'Davies', 'performance', 'so', 'great', 'fact', 'never', 'fact', 'Charles', 'Manson', 'know', 'nutcase', 'Manson', 'energy', 'someone', 'who', 'what', 'everything', 'get', 'just', 'showing', 'up', 'Beach', 'Boy', 'guest', 'house', 'threaten', 'deluding', 'thinking', 'musical', 'career', 'will', 'take', 'off', 'extremely', 'compelling', 'could', 'just', 'watch', 'being', 'Manson', 'entire', 'movie', 'fact', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'convey', 'charisma', 'made', 'people', 'want', 'join', 'up', 'Manson', 'first', 'place.The', 'movie', 'wisely', 'main', 'witness', 'trial', 'perspective', 'character', 'get', 'see', 'joining', 'commune', 'get', 'away', 'husband', 'giving', 'up', 'possessions', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'very', 'intrusive', 'good', 'idea', 'time', 'seduced', 'Manson', 'then', 'more', 'things', 'out', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'there', 'anymore', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'more', 'exploration', 'character', 'choices', 'seem', 'gibe', 'too', 'well', 'woman', 'self-justifying', 'story', 'work', 'well', 'perspective', 'get', 'see', 'charisma', 'discomfort', 'many', 'other', 'cult', 'members']",N/A
848591,A18OGZU0J9Z4YR,B0002WZRVS,Trauma,"[3, 4]","I am not a big fan of movies based on scumbag serial killers but the history surrounding the likes of Manson and a few others does warrant some curiousity about our culture and species.Helter Skelter is a tv remake of a tv movie which I allways found to be dull and contrived.If you are to do a movie about one of these people make it 3 dimensional show every aspect of every opinion of every one involved.In the past few years there have been movies based on Bundy, Gein,The Nightstalker,The Hillside Strangler,Damher and many others.I have watched some of them and all I can say is that they tend to exploit their crimes  rather than offer some perspective or insight into the minds of theses people and their crimes.Having rented Helter Skelter fully ready to mock and ridicule its atrocious portrayals of one of americas most beloved and hated sociopaths I was stunned by the depth and care the producers of this version of Helter Skelter handled their source material.Jeremy Davies brings Manson to life in ways that spooked me to my core his movements and gestures  reminded me of the countless documentries and interviews I have watched throughout the course of my life.The suppourting cast are easy to relate to because this film concentrates more on the side of humanity rather than a moral or legal standpoint.Helter Skelter is an unflinching look at a man who used the flaws of our society during an era when the entire country was ripped apart and divided by war,race,poverty and the death of the american dream.I highly reccomend this to anyone with the emotional stamina and logical capacity to endure such a horrible topic to ponder and wonder about.",4,Fear &amp; Loathing,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,1665,"['am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'movies', 'based', 'scumbag', 'serial', 'killers', 'history', 'surrounding', 'likes', 'Manson', 'few', 'others', 'warrant', 'curiousity', 'culture', 'species.Helter', 'Skelter', 'tv', 'remake', 'tv', 'movie', 'allways', 'found', 'be', 'dull', 'contrived.If', 'are', 'do', 'movie', 'one', 'people', 'make', '3', 'dimensional', 'show', 'aspect', 'opinion', 'one', 'involved.In', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'there', 'have', 'been', 'movies', 'based', 'Bundy', 'Gein', 'Nightstalker', 'Hillside', 'Strangler', 'Damher', 'many', 'others.I', 'have', 'watched', 'can', 'say', 'tend', 'exploit', 'crimes', 'rather', 'offer', 'perspective', 'insight', 'minds', 'theses', 'people', 'crimes.Having', 'rented', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'fully', 'ready', 'mock', 'ridicule', 'atrocious', 'portrayals', 'one', 'americas', 'most', 'beloved', 'hated', 'sociopaths', 'was', 'stunned', 'depth', 'care', 'producers', 'version', 'Helter', 'Skelter', 'handled', 'source', 'material.Jeremy', 'Davies', 'Manson', 'life', 'ways', 'spooked', 'core', 'movements', 'gestures', 'reminded', 'countless', 'documentries', 'interviews', 'have', 'watched', 'course', 'life.The', 'suppourting', 'cast', 'are', 'easy', 'relate', 'film', 'more', 'side', 'humanity', 'rather', 'moral', 'legal', 'standpoint.Helter', 'Skelter', 'unflinching', 'look', 'man', 'who', 'used', 'flaws', 'society', 'era', 'when', 'entire', 'country', 'was', 'ripped', 'apart', 'divided', 'war', 'race', 'poverty', 'death', 'american', 'dream.I', 'highly', 'reccomend', 'anyone', 'emotional', 'stamina', 'logical', 'capacity', 'endure', 'horrible', 'topic', 'ponder', 'wonder']",N/A
