1169445,AGQCV7HCTD84,B001AZIS12,"Cannington De Ness ""Ness""","[9, 9]","IT is a series of skits, with many great gems. There are moments where it can fail, but think of it like a courtroom Dailyshow...kind of but not really. It is a made up vs debate where two comedians go head to head on why one thing is worse than another. Lewis judges, and jumps in from time to time, but the others (who have been on the Dailyshow and such) do the presentin of both sides. This is not 100% Black, it is more like 20% his work and the rest of the talk time is the presenters. I loved this show, downloaded every episode I could, now it is out on dvd...and it is mine!Some people may not feel 5 stars is correct, but I felt this show was so great at times I could not fault it. But if you are a Lewis Black fan...well you should like it too, but it seems from the other reviews they have issues with other people presenting. Hey it is both seasons!",5,Very funny show most of the time.

1169446,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B001AZIS12,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[14, 16]","Lewis Black is undoubtedly one of, if not the, funniest comedians in the business today, which is the one reason that Root of All Evil works as well as it does.  Black presides over some humerous debates between pairs of other comics (including Patton Oswalt, Greg Giraldo, and Mad TV vet Andrew Daly among others), who debate the evils of such things ranging from Oprah, Donald Trump, YouTube, marijuana, and more.  Frequently funny and even containing a good point here and there, Root of All Evil will keep you entertained, and will keep you laughing.  Sadly though, not as many laughs come from Black as one may like, and more often than not the debating comics become the centerpiece.  All in all, Root of All Evil is worth your time, but for big fans of Lewis Black, you may be a bit disappointed that he isn't constantly at the forefront.",4,Very funny take on debates featuring Lewis Black,1220918400,"09 9, 2008",2008,845,"['Lewis', 'Black', 'undoubtedly', 'one', 'not', 'funniest', 'comedians', 'business', 'today', 'one', 'reason', 'Root', 'All', 'Evil', 'as', 'well', 'Black', 'humerous', 'debates', 'pairs', 'other', 'comics', 'including', 'Patton', 'Oswalt', 'Greg', 'Giraldo', 'Mad', 'TV', 'vet', 'Andrew', 'Daly', 'others', 'who', 'debate', 'evils', 'such', 'things', 'ranging', 'Oprah', 'Donald', 'Trump', 'YouTube', 'marijuana', 'more', 'Frequently', 'funny', 'even', 'containing', 'good', 'point', 'here', 'there', 'Root', 'All', 'Evil', 'will', 'keep', 'entertained', 'will', 'keep', 'laughing', 'Sadly', 'not', 'many', 'laughs', 'come', 'Black', 'one', 'may', 'like', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'debating', 'comics', 'become', 'centerpiece', 'Root', 'All', 'Evil', 'time', 'big', 'fans', 'Lewis', 'Black', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', ""n't"", 'constantly', 'forefront']",Lewis Black's Root of All Evil
