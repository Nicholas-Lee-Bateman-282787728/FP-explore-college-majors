775549,A190HFJI5QWTWZ,B0000CDL6O,"METAL-ROB ""METAL-ROB""","[0, 0]","First, let me make the disclaimer upfront, that this is a B-movie, even C-Movie, if you will, in terms of budget. I realize that alone will send some packing, so I wanted to make that perfectly clear up front. But let me remind you that some of the greatest genre films ever made were B-grade. For example, the movie Phantasm, was certainly made on the cheap, and is a great movie. Now this movie is nowhere near as original as Phantasm, but then again, when it comes to vampire movies, originality has long left the building, and is extremely hard to come by given the number of vampire themed films over the decades.  That said, this is a well made, atmospheric movie, with good acting, good music, and coherent plotting. It was in my opinion really well done.  The characters are sympathetic, and are not one dimensional. The writing in terms of the characters response to the given situations and there reactions are quite believable and well written. There is no gratuitous nudity, which of course is unnecessary and often cheapens a good horror flick. Kudos to the crew that made this film, because it was truly a labor of love , you can tell. This film has loads of charm and atmosphere, and blood for that matter. There are several love stories, and the hero vampire is a tortured soul who wishes to do good, not harm. But the bad guys are truly bad and menacing as a good antagonist should be.  This is definitely one the gems in my collection. It's one of those movies where if you go in with your expectations to high, you may certainly be disappointed. This does not have the backing of a movie like say ""Interview with a Vampire,"" but because it is a B-movie, it has a gritty believability that sometimes succeeds because these characters seem more real than in a big Hollywood productions. I give it 3-Stars for these fine folks that did so much with obviously so little.
