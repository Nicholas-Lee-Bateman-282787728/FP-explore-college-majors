831186,A1SQFUCSPMUE8I,B0002DB5N6,ALF,"[22, 24]","""ALF"" is an excellent television show, and its first season (which aired in 1986-87) was probably its best. The show takes a standard family sitcom premise and adds its delightfully loony twist: the Tanners, a typical American household, get an indefinite houseguest in the form of a furry, 3-foot creature from another planet. The planet is Melmac, and the alien is ALF, a sarcastic, and lovable little guy. The sitcom delivered interesting plots and no shortage of laughs, and it never needed to add objectional material, allowing it to excel at entertaining the whole family.So, after all these years of the DVD industry thriving, and television sets being quite the hit, my dream of ""ALF"" on DVD in season sets finally has come true. I'd anticipated the release of this first season DVD set like few others, and when the day arrived, I made my trek to the store with excitement.First, the good news. All twenty-five episodes from the wonderful debut season of the show are presented here, with commendable picture and sound quality, and chapter stops. The menus are hosted by ALF himself and are clever, easy to navigate, and remarkably amusing. There's even a few genuinely interesting bonus features on Disc 4, in the way of a Gag Reel, Trivia Facts, and an alternate pilot.The bad news is, as a few other reviews have mentioned by now, is that the show is not presented in its original form. I thought that the 21-minute running times were a bit on the slight side, and it turns out that Lions Gate has released syndication edits of episodes, lopping off several minutes from each show. Why this decision was made, I have no idea. It's a terrible choice, and one which taints an otherwise delightful release. I was particularly troubled by ""Help Me, Rhonda"", one of my favorite episodes, which removes the Beach Boys song altogether through unusual editing and definitely changes the episode.Now I must admit that even if I knew the episodes were trimmed I'd still have bought it. ""ALF"" isn't on the air anymore, so this edited DVD is the only realistic alternative for those of us who didn't make our own tapes. The DVD format allows us to instead have instant access to any episode and in a superb digital presentation.I am sure that the complete episodes of the first season with music and all scenes intact will never see the light of day on DVD, so waiting for a correction is futile. Lions Gate has an opportunity to fix things for future season, but even if they do, that won't change the fact that they've taken ALF's best year and tainted its long, highly-anticipated DVD release. Surely, they'll lose some sales from those with strong enough wills to go without seeing the show. I love it too much to abstain altogether.Anyway, you should know that as you look into buying the set. I didn't know and I am quite disappointed that this ""Complete First Season"" is not complete. Still, it's episodes of ""ALF"" on DVD, and that's not a bad thing. I only wish that this wonderful sitcom would have received more appropriate treament on this format.5 stars for the show and maybe 2 for the DVD. Rounding down, that makes for a mediocre 3-star review for what should have been the easiest sitcom DVD to recommend.",3,Terrific show finally on DVD!

831191,AG40WLVFD2MQJ,B0002DB5N6,"Amazon Customer ""Raven""","[4, 5]","Truer words were never spoken by the delightful alien who came crashing into the Tanners garage way back in 1986. He is lazy, eats a lot, is fat and spends most of his time in front of the televison. Sounds familiar? This is the alien version of everybodies favourite cat, Garfield the lazy. The star of the show is of course Paul Fusco's Alf but the main actors are great, especially Max Wright and Anne Schedeen as Willie and Kate. Their relationship is the most normal and loving of all the father/mother relationships in all of the 80's comedy shows and Kate doesn't torment her husband like we saw on series like The Cosby Show. The kids are entertaining and the neighbours (played by Seinfeld's Liz Sheridan and John La Motta) are brilliant and intolerable.After years of loving this show, it is finally on DVD. And the DVD is brilliant. All the episodes in season 1 are entertaining although sadly some aspects are missing on the DVD -  scenes that must have been destroyed and that is a real shame. For instance the original pilot began by Willie and Brian walking to the garage but on the DVD, it begins with Willie and Kate in the garage (probably about 2-3 minutes later). And there are other examples. ""Mother And Daughter Reunion"" begins with Kate's mother arriving but Alf and Kate had been talking for some time (about how Alf was planing to watch TV all day long without having to move at all from the sofa) when her mother arrived in that episode (and part of the missing scene can be seen in that show's end credits). But that doesn't change the fact that one of the greatest television characters of all times is on DVD for all to enjoy. The special features are few but good and all the discs are hosted by Alf himself in his unique way. If you are a fan of Alf (or Garfield for that matter) this is a must in your collection. One of the greatest comedy series has arrived on DVD and those who buy this set will not be disappointed. I can't wait for season 2-4 as this is my favourite American comedy series alongside Seinfeld and Friends.",5,Why Do You Compare me with E.T. - I'M NOTHING LIKE E.T.,1092960000,"08 20, 2004",2004,2059,"['Truer', 'words', 'were', 'never', 'spoken', 'delightful', 'alien', 'who', 'came', 'crashing', 'Tanners', 'garage', 'way', 'back', '1986', 'lazy', 'lot', 'fat', 'most', 'time', 'front', 'televison', 'familiar', 'alien', 'version', 'everybodies', 'favourite', 'cat', 'Garfield', 'lazy', 'star', 'show', 'course', 'Paul', 'Fusco', 'Alf', 'main', 'actors', 'are', 'great', 'especially', 'Max', 'Wright', 'Anne', 'Schedeen', 'Willie', 'Kate', 'relationship', 'most', 'normal', 'loving', 'father/mother', 'relationships', '80', 'comedy', 'shows', 'Kate', ""n't"", 'torment', 'husband', 'saw', 'series', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'kids', 'are', 'entertaining', 'neighbours', 'played', 'Seinfeld', 'Liz', 'Sheridan', 'John', 'La', 'Motta', 'are', 'brilliant', 'intolerable.After', 'years', 'loving', 'show', 'finally', 'DVD', 'DVD', 'brilliant', 'episodes', 'season', '1', 'are', 'entertaining', 'sadly', 'aspects', 'are', 'missing', 'DVD', 'scenes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'destroyed', 'real', 'shame', 'instance', 'original', 'pilot', 'began', 'Willie', 'Brian', 'walking', 'garage', 'DVD', 'Willie', 'Kate', 'garage', 'probably', '2-3', 'minutes', 'later', 'are', 'other', 'examples', 'Mother', 'Daughter', 'Reunion', 'Kate', 'mother', 'arriving', 'Alf', 'Kate', 'had', 'been', 'talking', 'time', 'how', 'Alf', 'was', 'planing', 'watch', 'TV', 'day', 'long', 'having', 'move', 'sofa', 'when', 'mother', 'arrived', 'episode', 'part', 'missing', 'scene', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'show', 'end', 'credits', ""n't"", 'change', 'fact', 'one', 'greatest', 'television', 'characters', 'times', 'DVD', 'enjoy', 'special', 'features', 'are', 'few', 'good', 'discs', 'are', 'hosted', 'Alf', 'unique', 'way', 'are', 'fan', 'Alf', 'Garfield', 'matter', 'must', 'collection', 'One', 'greatest', 'comedy', 'series', 'arrived', 'DVD', 'who', 'buy', 'set', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'season', '2-4', 'favourite', 'American', 'comedy', 'series', 'Seinfeld', 'Friends']",ALF - Season One

It's a four disc set, but unlike the dividers I've grown accustomed to seeing in multi-DVD sets, this one actually stacks two DVD's on each side of the snap case, which is slightly larger than the normal DVD snap case.

Hurkman ""DJGamer""","[5, 11]","I was about two or three years old when Alf just aired, I was a big fan, though...but that's all I can really remember, and that I had an Alf doll.So when I watched the ""edited for syndication"" versions, I didn't notice the difference, since I hardly remembered the episodes themselves, and the only series my family has recorded in entirity is Star Trek: The Next Generation (and we're going to have to rely on those for quite some time, because the Season boxed sets are ridiculously overpriced), so I don't have the expectation of being able to replace anything like that.I really liked what parts of the epsisodes were on the set, and I assume now that the one hour ""recap"" episode contained parts of scenes originally edited-out for syndication, because there's a part of the converstation in the jail cell scene that I didn't remember seeing before, so I guess that explains the mystery.Another thing is that the recap episode also contained at least one scene from an episode that came after it on the DVD, which leads me to wonder if the episode actually aired before or after that one, and if they put them in the wrong order.Sure, the whole having to use a menu thing to select the episodes is kind of annoying, but since Alf gives a little summary of each one, it's kind of neat, because I can return to the menu, select the summary (the audio's a bit delayed, though, it sometimes needs to be watched twice to hear eveything he says), and then watch the episode.Also, there's outtakes (from all the four seasons, I'm assuming), and trivia facts, which are interesting, as well as the unaired pilot episode.It would've been cool if they would have had some kind of feature on the Alf puppet, sure it would maybe shock and disillusion some younger new fans, but it's better that they find out he's just a puppet now. lolI'd just love to know how the puppet works, I'm into this kind of special effects stuff.  I do know they had a stand-in (either a young child or some kind of midget) in a costume (it's painfully obvious, which is probably why they used it less and less as the series went on) to show Alf walking around.Overall, I give it a five because the series is so incredibly funny, and gives me a feeling of nostalgia even though I really don't remember the individual episodes.",5,I didn't even notice...,1092355200,"08 13, 2004",2004,2298,"['was', 'about', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'old', 'when', 'Alf', 'just', 'aired', 'was', 'big', 'fan', 'can', 'really', 'remember', 'had', 'Alf', 'doll.So', 'when', 'watched', 'edited', 'syndication', 'versions', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'difference', 'hardly', 'remembered', 'episodes', 'only', 'series', 'family', 'recorded', 'entirity', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', ""'re"", 'going', 'have', 'rely', 'quite', 'time', 'Season', 'boxed', 'sets', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'overpriced', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'expectation', 'being', 'able', 'replace', 'anything', 'that.I', 'really', 'liked', 'what', 'parts', 'epsisodes', 'were', 'set', 'assume', 'now', 'one', 'hour', 'recap', 'episode', 'contained', 'parts', 'scenes', 'originally', 'edited-out', 'syndication', 'part', 'converstation', 'jail', 'cell', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'seeing', 'guess', 'mystery.Another', 'thing', 'recap', 'episode', 'also', 'contained', 'least', 'one', 'scene', 'episode', 'came', 'DVD', 'wonder', 'episode', 'actually', 'aired', 'one', 'put', 'wrong', 'order.Sure', 'whole', 'having', 'use', 'menu', 'thing', 'select', 'episodes', 'kind', 'annoying', 'Alf', 'little', 'summary', 'one', 'kind', 'neat', 'can', 'return', 'menu', 'select', 'summary', 'audio', 'bit', 'delayed', 'though', 'sometimes', 'be', 'watched', 'twice', 'hear', 'eveything', 'then', 'watch', 'episode.Also', 'outtakes', 'four', 'seasons', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'trivia', 'facts', 'are', 'interesting', 'as', 'well', 'unaired', 'pilot', 'episode.It', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'cool', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'kind', 'feature', 'Alf', 'puppet', 'sure', 'would', 'maybe', 'shock', 'disillusion', 'younger', 'new', 'fans', 'better', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'puppet', 'now', 'lolI', ""'d"", 'just', 'love', 'know', 'how', 'puppet', ""'m"", 'kind', 'special', 'effects', 'stuff', 'do', 'know', 'had', 'stand-in', 'young', 'child', 'kind', 'midget', 'costume', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'probably', 'why', 'used', 'less', 'less', 'series', 'went', 'show', 'Alf', 'walking', 'around.Overall', 'give', 'five', 'series', 'so', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'feeling', 'nostalgia', 'even', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'individual', 'episodes']",ALF - Season One

831232,A2ZL50NLGWCPZ1,B0002DB5N6,Lola Legendre,"[3, 8]","I bought this DVD set because I remembered ""ALF"" fondly from when I was little (I was 4 when it started but I must have been about 6 or 7 during the time I watched it) and was eager to see it again after all these years.  I hadn't seen any of the episodes since they originally aired so when I started watching them on this DVD I was a bit disappointed that the show isn't as great as I remembered it.  The setup is goofy but original--a wisecracking, gruff-voiced alien living with an American family.  Once you accept that premise, though, you find that the jokes and dialogue just aren't very clever or sharp as most comedy shows need to be nowadays in order to survive.  Certainly it isn't entirely a question of the show's age--there are many sitcoms made at the same time or much earlier than ""ALF"" that are still hilarious when watched today--but I think this show was popular at the time largely because or its original premise, while today's audience would expect sharper, wittier humor in addition to that.  ""ALF"" is also terribly cute, which probably explains why I liked it when I was a small child but why most of the jokes seem to fall flat as I watch them now.  Because cute is just not funny.  What I mean by cute is, a lot of the supposed humor comes just from showing ALF with different props or in different costumes.  Or from some of the little boy Brian's silly lines.  I mean some of those things may make you smile but I don't find them exactly hilarious.  And overall I think most of the jokes just aren't interesting or funny enough.  Many of the lines/observations just seem too straightforward, and much of the time when the laugh track is played I find myself thinking ""THAT was supposed to be funny?""  Like, just as an example, this exchange in the first episode between Brian and the mother, Kate.Kate: This thing is not staying in anybody's room.  It's not staying.Brian:  Why not?  E.T. got to stay.,Kate: E.T. was a movie.  This is real!  This is on our coffee table!And that seems to be kind of a typical joke for the series--just not quite funny enough to be worth a laugh (barely even qualifies as a joke, actually).  To be fair, though, most of the dull moments (such as that one) are when ALF himself is unconscious and not speaking or just not in the scene.  Although some of ALF's lines also elicit eye-rolls, he does have some funny smart-alecky comebacks.  The show is at its best when ALF is playing off of the dad's neurotic uptightness, e.g. when ALF asks him for a kiss on his birthday, Willie reluctantly complies and ALF quips ""Not bad. Still waters run deep there, William,"" after which they both wipe their mouths.  Willie is so flustered and seething with anger all the time (although you can tell a lot of the time it's just the actor struggling to remember his lines) that he's a bit creepy, although in a way it does make him a good foil for the Alfmeister.  So the show has some humorous moments although I wouldn't really give it that same ""classic"" status as, say, a ""Cosby Show"" or ""I Love Lucy."" And if I may just throw out a couple other criticisms, let me say that the show does have a few contrivances that are a bit silly, like they never seem to bother to explain why ALF happens to speak the same language as the Tanners, and I think the whole ALF wanting to eat the cat thing gets a bit tired after a while.Of course I also must mention, as many others already have, that the syndicated version of the show is what was released.  What can I say?  Unacceptable.  I pre-ordered this set before it first came out so I didn't find that out until I'd already received and opened it, otherwise I might have returned it.  After watching the first disc and half of the second I got bored of it, but I just now finally got around to watching the whole thing (so I could sell it, since this is obviously not something I'd want to revisit repeatedly.)  I admit I'll probably rent the remaining seasons just out of nostalgia, though.  I certainly hope Kate's hair gets better during the rest of the shows though--that...creation on her head is almost weirder-looking than ALF himself.",2,Hasn't aged very well--but kind of funny at times,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,4138,"['bought', 'DVD', 'set', 'remembered', 'ALF', 'fondly', 'when', 'was', 'little', 'was', '4', 'when', 'started', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'about', '6', '7', 'time', 'watched', 'was', 'eager', 'see', 'again', 'years', 'had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'episodes', 'originally', 'aired', 'so', 'when', 'started', 'watching', 'DVD', 'was', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'show', ""n't"", 'as', 'great', 'remembered', 'setup', 'goofy', 'original', 'wisecracking', 'gruff-voiced', 'alien', 'living', 'American', 'family', 'Once', 'accept', 'premise', 'though', 'find', 'jokes', 'dialogue', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'clever', 'sharp', 'most', 'comedy', 'shows', 'need', 'be', 'nowadays', 'order', 'survive', 'Certainly', ""n't"", 'entirely', 'question', 'show', 'age', 'are', 'many', 'sitcoms', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'much', 'earlier', 'ALF', 'are', 'still', 'hilarious', 'when', 'watched', 'today', 'think', 'show', 'was', 'popular', 'time', 'largely', 'original', 'premise', 'today', 'audience', 'would', 'expect', 'sharper', 'wittier', 'humor', 'addition', 'ALF', 'also', 'terribly', 'cute', 'probably', 'why', 'liked', 'when', 'was', 'small', 'child', 'why', 'most', 'jokes', 'seem', 'fall', 'flat', 'watch', 'now', 'cute', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'What', 'mean', 'cute', 'lot', 'supposed', 'humor', 'just', 'showing', 'ALF', 'different', 'props', 'different', 'costumes', 'little', 'boy', 'Brian', 'silly', 'lines', 'mean', 'things', 'may', 'make', 'smile', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'exactly', 'hilarious', 'overall', 'think', 'most', 'jokes', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'funny', 'enough', 'Many', 'lines/observations', 'just', 'seem', 'too', 'straightforward', 'much', 'time', 'when', 'laugh', 'track', 'played', 'find', 'thinking', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'just', 'example', 'exchange', 'first', 'episode', 'Brian', 'mother', 'Kate.Kate', 'thing', 'not', 'staying', 'anybody', 'room', 'not', 'staying.Brian', 'Why', 'not', 'E.T', 'got', 'stay.', 'Kate', 'E.T', 'was', 'movie', 'real', 'coffee', 'table', 'be', 'kind', 'typical', 'joke', 'series', 'just', 'not', 'quite', 'funny', 'enough', 'be', 'laugh', 'barely', 'even', 'joke', 'actually', 'be', 'fair', 'though', 'most', 'dull', 'moments', 'such', 'one', 'are', 'when', 'ALF', 'unconscious', 'not', 'speaking', 'just', 'not', 'scene', 'ALF', 'lines', 'also', 'elicit', 'eye-rolls', 'have', 'funny', 'smart-alecky', 'comebacks', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'ALF', 'playing', 'dad', 'neurotic', 'uptightness', 'e.g', 'when', 'ALF', 'kiss', 'birthday', 'Willie', 'reluctantly', 'complies', 'ALF', 'Not', 'bad', 'Still', 'waters', 'run', 'deep', 'there', 'William', 'wipe', 'mouths', 'Willie', 'so', 'flustered', 'seething', 'anger', 'time', 'can', 'tell', 'lot', 'time', 'just', 'actor', 'struggling', 'remember', 'lines', 'bit', 'creepy', 'way', 'make', 'good', 'foil', 'Alfmeister', 'show', 'humorous', 'moments', 'would', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'same', 'classic', 'status', 'say', 'Cosby', 'Show', 'Love', 'Lucy', 'may', 'just', 'throw', 'out', 'couple', 'other', 'criticisms', 'let', 'say', 'show', 'have', 'few', 'contrivances', 'are', 'bit', 'silly', 'never', 'seem', 'bother', 'explain', 'why', 'ALF', 'speak', 'same', 'language', 'Tanners', 'think', 'whole', 'ALF', 'wanting', 'eat', 'cat', 'thing', 'bit', 'tired', 'while.Of', 'course', 'also', 'must', 'mention', 'many', 'others', 'already', 'have', 'syndicated', 'version', 'show', 'what', 'was', 'released', 'What', 'can', 'say', 'Unacceptable', 'pre-ordered', 'set', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', ""'d"", 'already', 'received', 'opened', 'otherwise', 'might', 'have', 'returned', 'watching', 'first', 'disc', 'half', 'second', 'got', 'bored', 'just', 'now', 'finally', 'got', 'watching', 'whole', 'thing', 'could', 'sell', 'obviously', 'not', 'something', ""'d"", 'want', 'revisit', 'repeatedly', 'admit', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'rent', 'remaining', 'seasons', 'just', 'nostalgia', 'certainly', 'hope', 'Kate', 'hair', 'better', 'rest', 'shows', 'creation', 'head', 'almost', 'weirder-looking', 'ALF']",ALF - Season One

831253,A1165I5PFKIFEL,B0002DB5N6,"Robert Carver ""Space Historian""","[0, 1]","I just watched the first season of ALF on DVD. This is the first time I have seen the series since it originally aired on TV in the late 80's. I was a big fan of the show back then but I was young, impressionable and in college. I wondered how the show had aged because I had aged as well. I shouldn't have worried because while it can look cheesy at times with the low quality video and the stiff acting (by the humans not ALF) it still is a darn funny, witty, cheeky and sometimes touching comedy. ALF may be an alien and his home planet of Melmac was a planet located in the Aldente Nebula in the Andromeda Galaxy but the humor is all Borscht Belt! The relationship between ALF and Willie (Max Wright) was a lot of fun to watch. Willie was an amateur astronomer and obviously had an interest in space (he received a book about the universe for his birthday) so he was overwhelmed to meet a sentient alien life form. That amazement would often turn to frustration because ALF acted like an ADHD 10-year-old getting into mischief. The Tanner kids (Andrea Elson & Benji Gregory Hertzberg) didn't take long to fully embrace ALF as a member of the family. The most friction occurred between Alf and Kate (Anne Schedeen) who was the most suspicious and concerned about having a hyperactive alien live in her home. So I enjoyed visiting with ALF and the Tanners again after all of these years. My favorite first season episode was one I remembered quite well from its original broadcast, ""La Cucaracha."" I still laughed pretty hard as ALF struggled to keep from being eaten by the gargantuan Melmacian cockroach. I know there have been rumors about bring back ALF as a TV series and given the number of reboots of old shows that have been successful I am surprised ALF hasn't been returned to the airwaves. 2012 finds our country and world much more troubled and divided than it was in the late 80's.

This is not the case with ""ALF,"" or at least, the first season box set.  Being a big fan of the show I used to record the episodes on VHS tape during the first run. I was disappointed to find out that in the DVD set, the episodes do not contain the original opening in its entirty, and that a lot of content of the episodes has been cut.  I thought I was watching a re-release of the show on TV Land which butchers episodes of TV only to fit in more rediculous commercials.  Of the box sets of my favorite shows I've purchased, this is the first I've seen where a show has been horribly cut up, not reflecting the original length.

I expected to be able to eliminate them from my ever-cluttered collection of stuff with the purchase of this long awaited set. Why Lions Gate chose to use edited syndication episodes completely baffles the imagination. Perhaps they plan on later releasing a ""Deluxe Edition"" so that the consumer will get hit twice to pay for the same product. The $40 list price should have more than adequately covered licensing the rights to the full episodes, but I guess there's no end to corporate greed.I am stunned by the rave reviews of the Extras: 1) a short gag reel of which only about 15% is funny, 2) some brief trivia screens which is mostly made up of obvious facts that any fan of the show already knows (like A.L.F. stands for Alien Life Form, for example), and 3) credits screens - credits for the DVD authoring is now considered a bonus extra?!?! Sheesh! Would have made better sense to have included some of the best ALF bits from Hollywood Squares, or even included some of the many commercials ALF has appeared in over the years. Or interviews with the cast reflecting on being a part of the show.The omission of a feature to play all of the episodes on a disc is simply appalling. Interactive is nice, but can you imagine an audio CD in which you have to select each song separately? Adding this feature would have taken the authors mere minutes to code. I just don't get it.Rather than deluxe packaging, like you get with most TV series box sets, a clamshell case crams in the four discs in a clunky, overlapping layout. No book, either, just a single sheet listing the discs and episodes, and a slipcover for the case. I've seen public domain sets packaged better.I'm not sure if the picture quality is due to the original source or not, so I'll reserve judgement on that. Just don't touch the Zoom button because the artifacting from the low bitrate encoding is completely useless. Even still frames in normal mode look bumpy. No other TV series sets in my collection have these problems. How could so many elements get overlooked?The three stars are for the episodes themselves, which are priceless. A smart, funny, irreverent sitcom that eclipsed ""Mork and Mindy"", which aired opposite ALF on rival network ABC. I still laugh out loud every time I view this wonderful series.

The official word from Lion's Gate is that the cut episodes were already digitized so...best for the quality.Herein lies the problem...cut episodes but very nice video quality.  The set, if not for the cut episodes would be great.  The only other downer in this set is the packaging.  A single case holding the 4 DVD's overlapping each other makes it tough for one to get the bottom disc out...you need to take the top one off if you aren't having a marathon.  As for the show itself...it's as you remember it, minus a minute or two each episode.  You hated it or you didn't.  I for one, found the show quite funny and compared to the mass quantity of family on a couch sitcoms nowadays, ALF was and is a refreshing change of pace.If Lion's Gate had the full versions of the episodes, this would have received a full 5 stars...for those who don't recall ALF very well, you might not notice but for ALF fans, this was a low blow.  I still bought it, buit wrote a letter to Lion's Gate stating that we want UN cut shows on DVD thank you.  Your call...I recommend it but with the disclaimer...some scenes are missin'!",4,So close...oh so close,1093564800,"08 27, 2004",2004,1655,"['OK.', 'see', 'ALF', 'season', '1', 'DVD', 'rejoice', 'buy', 'pop', 'DVD', 'player', 'good', 'ALF', 'menus', 'first', 'episode', 'played', 'laugh', 'video', 'quality', 'old', 'show', 'great', 'watch', 'few', 'more', 'good', 'seem', 'remember', 'certain', 'lines', 'jokes', 'are', 'missing', 'Then', 'episodes', 'are', 'cut', 'are', 'syndicated', 'versions', 'Meaning', 'have', 'been', 'chopped', 'syndication', 'when', 'series', 'reruns', 'so', 'networks', 'can', 'squeeze', 'few', 'extra', 'commercials', 'official', 'word', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'cut', 'episodes', 'were', 'already', 'digitized', 'so', 'best', 'quality.Herein', 'problem', 'cut', 'episodes', 'very', 'nice', 'video', 'quality', 'set', 'not', 'cut', 'episodes', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'only', 'other', 'downer', 'set', 'packaging', 'single', 'case', 'holding', '4', 'DVD', 'overlapping', 'other', 'tough', 'one', 'get', 'bottom', 'out', 'need', 'take', 'top', 'one', 'are', ""n't"", 'having', 'marathon', 'show', 'remember', 'minute', 'two', 'episode', 'hated', 'did', ""n't"", 'one', 'found', 'show', 'quite', 'funny', 'compared', 'mass', 'quantity', 'family', 'couch', 'sitcoms', 'nowadays', 'ALF', 'was', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace.If', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'had', 'full', 'versions', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'received', 'full', '5', 'stars', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'recall', 'ALF', 'very', 'well', 'might', 'not', 'notice', 'ALF', 'fans', 'was', 'low', 'blow', 'still', 'bought', 'wrote', 'letter', 'Lion', 'Gate', 'stating', 'want', 'UN', 'cut', 'shows', 'DVD', 'thank', 'call', 'recommend', 'disclaimer', 'scenes', 'are', 'missin']",ALF - Season One

I wasn't dissappointed: ALF is just as funny to me as an adult as when I was a kid. And this allowed me to find a new favorite--Willy (the father) is excellently written and acted, he plays the perfect foil to ALF.The kids, however, are not as great as I remember them. These characters are almost cheesy in their wholesomeness--it's very hard to suspend that much disbelief.As for the DVD set, I've heard that this version is somewhat cut, but since I don't really remember the originals, I thought this version was just fine.

831277,A6B41QYBJ1XPJ,B0002DB5N6,yankeesrule1989,"[2, 2]","I was born three weeks after season 3 ended in May 1989 so I obviously have no memory of watching ALF during the original run. But my family loved it from what I've heard and seen. In my house, I came across a plush doll, ""U.S. of ALF"" trivia cards, and even a comic book. My mom even put ALF on my uncle's birthday cake one year so there was obviously a cake-set being sold as well.I was excited to see this on DVD after discovering it in reruns but like many I was very upset that all 4 seasons contained the chopped up edited episodes instead of the original broadcast. Even some episodes had songs cut out so that was up to 6 minutes of missing footage. Lionsgate claims that the original episodes were too poor in quality to clean up so they had no choice but to use the readily available syndicated versions. How were episodes produced in the 80s poorer quality than say, an episode of a sitcom produced in the 50s or 60s? I have several of those (I'm a big Lucille Ball fan and I love her work) and the picture/sound quality is SUPERB.Cut up episodes is the reason why I didn't buy all the sets, just 1 and 4. I only bought 4 because WGN wouldn't air it and the episodes were not on Hulu or Youtube. I got season 1 as a gift. The only good thing about the American sets is the menus, bloopers and picture quality. And the original pilot as an extra.Then I learned fantastic news, Warner Home Video was releasing it UNCUT overseas, with all original music intact and default English audio. And it could be shipped to the US. I now own all 4 seasons uncut. Only 1 or 2 episodes from season 1 have a cut in them--in ""For your eyes only,"" they cut out the Chipmunks Christmas song. And the original ""Try to Remember"" was not on there either but through the power of the Internet was able to find a copy of the uncut 1987 broadcast. So in your face censors! On season 2 the only edited episode is the Gilligan episode but with original music. Sure the picture quality on the region 2 dvds isn't perfect and there's no extras, but it is clear and I'm glad to have those than the pathetic excuses for a ""complete season"" dvd.Also if the original broadcast episodes were ""too poor in quality"" to clean up, how did they get them overseas? And even in their full length in overseas reruns? (Seen some on Youtube but the European dialogue is dubbed over the English so it's hard to hear)So don't waste your money buying chopped up episodes. Spring for the uncut region 2 set instead. You will need a region free dvd player though. To whoever thinks this is acceptable when the unedited episodes are now out there, I pity you. I'm using the same logic as others--go to a baseball game and only stay for 6 innings, or turn around halfway to your destination and go back home. See how that feels.",2,"Love ALF, hate the DVD.
