414248,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,630430840X,Acute Observer,"[3, 5]","This film is based on a factual story from Ed Montgomery, a reporter for the `San Francisco Chronicle'. It shows a jazz club, later a vice cop shows up and arrests Babs. We see Babs dancing at a party, later she agrees to provide an alibi for two crooks; This leads to a perjury conviction. She is given good advice to correct her behavior; but she doesn't listen. Babs tries to live a normal life, but her husband used drugs and things go bad. Babs hooks up with her old buddies. [The film skips over the Monahan murder; was Babs a decoy?] The police trail Babs and catch the two murderers. Barbara Graham acts tough and hard-boiled, and refuses to cooperate with the police when offered a deal. She is indicted along with the others for the murder of Mrs. Monahan. A lawyer advises her about the forthcoming trial, she needs an alibi. Babs foolishly trusts another inmate, a friendly stranger, to arrange an alibi. In desperation she agrees to cooperate with this stranger. [No warning about Miranda.]The state's witness was part of the gang, but he will testify against the others and then be released for his testimony. That stranger turns out to be an undercover policeman; Babs' goose is cooked. Babs' letter to her husband was intercepted; he is no help. They are all convicted and sentenced to death. Barbara is sent to the woman's prison, ""the campus"". A psychiatrist evaluates Babs, and thinks she did not commit the murder. (Babs is left-handed and could not have struck the victim with her right hand.) He advises Ed Montgomery to write stories that will present Babs in a better light. Babs' appeal is turned down. Her hope is raised by a Supreme Court appeal, but that is rejected. Babs' case sells a lot of newspapers, win or lose.Babs is transported to San Quentin for execution of her sentence. She is prepared for death. Her lawyer files another petition, and keeps trying. The preparation of the gas chamber begins. Babs will go first, followed by the two men. Tension mounts as the Governor grants a stay to let her lawyer make his appeal. But it is not allowed. The witnesses gather around the gas chamber. Then its time. Babs last request is for a mask; she doesn't want to see the strangers there. The film shows the graphic details of her death.Susan Hayward deservedly won the highest Hollywood award for her acting in this drama. The undertones of this story is to question the death penalty as it was applied to Babs. The improvements in scientific testing and other reforms might have saved Babs today (if she was not involved). Do newspapers and broadcast media still present a one-sided view of a suspect? Even after the Supreme Court ruling on ""Shepard vs. Ohio""? Newspapers are no longer a locally operated business today. The warning in this film is to be careful of who you hang out with. Those who need this advice will ignore it.",5,Going the Wrong Way,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,2865,"['film', 'based', 'factual', 'story', 'Ed', 'Montgomery', 'reporter', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Chronicle', 'jazz', 'club', 'later', 'vice', 'cop', 'up', 'arrests', 'Babs', 'see', 'Babs', 'dancing', 'party', 'later', 'provide', 'alibi', 'two', 'crooks', 'perjury', 'conviction', 'given', 'good', 'advice', 'correct', 'behavior', ""n't"", 'listen', 'Babs', 'live', 'normal', 'life', 'husband', 'used', 'drugs', 'things', 'go', 'bad', 'Babs', 'up', 'old', 'buddies', '[', 'film', 'Monahan', 'murder', 'was', 'Babs', 'decoy', 'police', 'trail', 'Babs', 'catch', 'two', 'murderers', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'tough', 'hard-boiled', 'cooperate', 'police', 'when', 'offered', 'deal', 'indicted', 'others', 'murder', 'Mrs.', 'Monahan', 'A', 'lawyer', 'forthcoming', 'trial', 'alibi', 'Babs', 'foolishly', 'trusts', 'inmate', 'friendly', 'stranger', 'arrange', 'alibi', 'desperation', 'cooperate', 'stranger', 'warning', 'Miranda', ']', 'state', 'witness', 'was', 'part', 'gang', 'will', 'testify', 'others', 'then', 'be', 'released', 'testimony', 'stranger', 'out', 'be', 'undercover', 'policeman', 'Babs', 'goose', 'cooked', 'Babs', 'letter', 'husband', 'was', 'intercepted', 'help', 'are', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'Barbara', 'sent', 'woman', 'prison', 'campus', 'psychiatrist', 'Babs', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'murder', 'Babs', 'left-handed', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'struck', 'victim', 'right', 'hand', 'Ed', 'Montgomery', 'write', 'stories', 'will', 'present', 'Babs', 'better', 'light', 'Babs', 'appeal', 'turned', 'down', 'hope', 'raised', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'appeal', 'rejected', 'Babs', 'case', 'lot', 'newspapers', 'win', 'lose.Babs', 'transported', 'San', 'Quentin', 'execution', 'sentence', 'prepared', 'death', 'lawyer', 'petition', 'trying', 'preparation', 'gas', 'chamber', 'Babs', 'will', 'go', 'first', 'followed', 'two', 'men', 'Tension', 'mounts', 'Governor', 'stay', 'let', 'lawyer', 'make', 'appeal', 'not', 'allowed', 'witnesses', 'gather', 'gas', 'chamber', 'Then', 'time', 'Babs', 'last', 'request', 'mask', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'strangers', 'there', 'film', 'graphic', 'details', 'death.Susan', 'Hayward', 'deservedly', 'won', 'highest', 'Hollywood', 'award', 'acting', 'drama', 'undertones', 'story', 'question', 'death', 'penalty', 'was', 'applied', 'Babs', 'improvements', 'scientific', 'testing', 'other', 'reforms', 'might', 'have', 'saved', 'Babs', 'today', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'Do', 'newspapers', 'broadcast', 'media', 'still', 'present', 'one-sided', 'view', 'suspect', 'Even', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'ruling', 'Shepard', 'vs.', 'Ohio', 'Newspapers', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'locally', 'operated', 'business', 'today', 'warning', 'film', 'be', 'careful', 'who', 'hang', 'out', 'who', 'need', 'advice', 'will', 'ignore']",I Want to Live VHS

Here Ms. Hayward plays Barbara Graham, a party girl (nice, right) who gets mixed up, mixed up big time, in a heist that went wrong, badly wrong, leading to the murder of an elderly woman.Life had not dealt bout a square hand to Barbara so she wound up, like many another guy or gal from the wrong side of the tracks doing as she said ""the best she could."" She got mixed up with some wrong gees and as mentioned above got mixed up with a murder. And as if, once again, to prove that there is no honor among thieves, they set out to place the frame on her.And with her  devil take the hinter post attitude she worms her way into the death penalty, the death penalty in a time when that act was carried out quite frequently including to women.That is where the acting part of the film really takes off and Ms. Hayward earns her Oscar. From that wayward party girl she turns thoughtful and then terrified at the state-imposed death that stares her right in the face. There is some controversy over the details; the guilt or innocence of Barbara Graham, of the actual case that the film is based on but Ms. Hayward's performance should make one think twice about the question of the death penalty as state policy.",4,If The Frame Fits?,1338249600,"05 29, 2012",2012,1471,"['Normally', 'one', 'would', 'not', 'expect', 'actress', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'roles', 'were', 'mostly', 'romantic', 'demure', 'leading', 'ladies', 'mixed-', 'up', 'affair', 'shine', 'film', 'review', 'Want', 'Live', 'just', 'enough', 'type', 'have', 'been', 'Oscar-worthy', 'Here', 'Ms.', 'Hayward', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'party', 'girl', 'nice', 'right', 'who', 'mixed', 'up', 'mixed', 'up', 'big', 'time', 'heist', 'went', 'wrong', 'badly', 'wrong', 'leading', 'murder', 'elderly', 'woman.Life', 'had', 'not', 'dealt', 'square', 'hand', 'Barbara', 'wound', 'up', 'many', 'guy', 'gal', 'wrong', 'side', 'tracks', 'doing', 'said', 'best', 'could', 'got', 'mixed', 'up', 'wrong', 'gees', 'as', 'mentioned', 'got', 'mixed', 'up', 'murder', 'once', 'again', 'prove', 'honor', 'thieves', 'set', 'out', 'place', 'frame', 'her.And', 'devil', 'take', 'hinter', 'post', 'attitude', 'way', 'death', 'penalty', 'death', 'penalty', 'time', 'when', 'act', 'was', 'carried', 'out', 'quite', 'frequently', 'including', 'women.That', 'where', 'acting', 'part', 'film', 'really', 'Ms.', 'Hayward', 'Oscar', 'wayward', 'party', 'girl', 'thoughtful', 'then', 'terrified', 'state-imposed', 'death', 'right', 'face', 'controversy', 'details', 'guilt', 'innocence', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'actual', 'case', 'film', 'based', 'Ms.', 'Hayward', 'performance', 'should', 'make', 'one', 'think', 'twice', 'question', 'death', 'penalty', 'state', 'policy']",I Want to Live VHS

Professing her innocence right up to the end, Barbara is a sly, sardonic but always-likable woman who wins the heart of the audience.

414253,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,630430840X,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[58, 58]","Barbara Graham was a known prostitute with criminal associates.  In the early 1950s, Graham and two men were accused of and arrested for the brutal murder of elderly Mable Monahan during the course of a robbery.  Convicted and sentenced to death in California's gas chamber, Graham protested her innocence to the end--and many considered that she was less a criminal than a victim of circumstance and that she had been railroaded to conviction and execution.  The celebrated 1958 film I WANT TO LIVE follows this point of view, presenting Graham as a thoroughly tough gal who in spite of her background was essentially more sinned against than sinner, and the result is an extremely intense, gripping film that shakes its viewers to the core.The film has a stark, realistic look, an excellent script, a pounding jazz score, and a strong supporting cast--but it is Susan Hayward's legendary performance that makes the film work.  She gives us a Graham who is half gun moll, half good time girl, and tough as nails all the way through--but who is nonetheless likeable, perhaps even admirable in her flat rebellion against a sickeningly hypocritical and repulsively white-bread society.  Although Hayward seems slightly artificial in the film's opening scenes, she quickly rises to the challenge of the role and gives an explosive performance as notable for its emotional hysteria as for its touching humanity.As the story moves toward its climax, the detail with which director Wise shows preparations for execution in the gas chamber and the intensity of Hayward's performance add up to one of the most powerful sequences in film history.  Ironically, Hayward privately stated that her own research led her to believe that Graham was guilty as sin--and today most people who have studied the case tend to believe that Graham was guilty indeed.  But whether the real-life Barbara Graham was innocent or guilty, this is a film that delivers one memorable, jolting, and very, very disturbing ride.  Strongly recommended, but not for the faint of heart.",5,Bravado Performance Heightens Intense Drama,1026259200,"07 10, 2002",2002,2048,"['Barbara', 'Graham', 'was', 'known', 'prostitute', 'criminal', 'associates', 'early', '1950s', 'Graham', 'two', 'men', 'were', 'accused', 'arrested', 'brutal', 'murder', 'elderly', 'Mable', 'Monahan', 'course', 'robbery', 'Convicted', 'sentenced', 'death', 'California', 'gas', 'chamber', 'Graham', 'protested', 'innocence', 'end', 'many', 'considered', 'was', 'less', 'criminal', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'had', 'been', 'railroaded', 'conviction', 'execution', 'celebrated', '1958', 'film', 'WANT', 'TO', 'LIVE', 'point', 'view', 'presenting', 'Graham', 'thoroughly', 'tough', 'gal', 'who', 'spite', 'background', 'was', 'essentially', 'more', 'sinned', 'sinner', 'result', 'extremely', 'intense', 'gripping', 'film', 'viewers', 'core.The', 'film', 'stark', 'realistic', 'look', 'excellent', 'script', 'pounding', 'jazz', 'score', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'legendary', 'performance', 'film', 'work', 'Graham', 'who', 'gun', 'moll', 'half', 'good', 'time', 'girl', 'tough', 'nails', 'way', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'likeable', 'perhaps', 'even', 'admirable', 'flat', 'rebellion', 'sickeningly', 'hypocritical', 'repulsively', 'white-bread', 'society', 'Hayward', 'slightly', 'artificial', 'film', 'opening', 'scenes', 'quickly', 'challenge', 'role', 'explosive', 'performance', 'notable', 'emotional', 'hysteria', 'touching', 'story', 'climax', 'detail', 'director', 'Wise', 'preparations', 'execution', 'gas', 'chamber', 'intensity', 'Hayward', 'performance', 'add', 'up', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'sequences', 'film', 'history', 'Ironically', 'Hayward', 'privately', 'stated', 'own', 'research', 'led', 'believe', 'Graham', 'was', 'guilty', 'sin', 'today', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'studied', 'case', 'tend', 'believe', 'Graham', 'was', 'guilty', 'indeed', 'real-life', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'was', 'innocent', 'guilty', 'film', 'one', 'memorable', 'jolting', 'very', 'very', 'disturbing', 'ride', 'Strongly', 'recommended', 'not', 'faint', 'heart']",I Want to Live VHS
414254,A1Y9IHSHVHSN0L,630430840X,Gary - Tucson AZ,"[2, 2]","I won't repeat the plot here; others have expressed it wonderfully.  Part of my draw to this film is that it is based on a real-life story (Barbara Graham.)  I have read that the director wanted to give this film sort of an anti-death penalty slant.  Perhaps, that accounts for showing the detailed execution preparations by the San Quentin correctional officers.  I do support the death penalty, but didn't really detect the bias against it in the film.  Ms. Hayward researched the case prior to signing on to the role.  She felt Ms. Graham was present at the time of Mabel Monahan's murder, but that perhaps she didn't actually commit the killing.  Susan Hayward is absolutely outstanding in this film, and her transformation from a hardened, cynical woman, convicted of a laundry list of prior crimes, to a frightened human being, while maintaining her dignity, is fascinating.

414263,A3TZB9SXJCFMFJ,630430840X,J. Michael Click,"[33, 34]","Susan Hayward made no bones about her career goals.  She had come to Hollywood in the late 1930's not to become ""just"" an Actress, but a Star.  It took a few hard years of playing supporting roles and minor leads, but eventually her talent and determination won out, and she broke through the ranks and achieved her goal.  Having reached the top, she set her sights even higher, stating clearly that she was focused on winning an Academy Award.  Her first nomination came in 1947 for the hard-hitting drama ""Smash-Up: The Story of a Woman"", but she lost to Loretta Young in ""The Farmer's Daughter"".  Hayward would rack up three more nominations (for ""My Foolish Heart"" in 1949; ""With a Song In My Heart"" in 1952; and ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" in 1955) before she finally hit Oscar paydirt in 1958 with ""I Want to Live!""""I Want to Live!"" tells the story of Barbara Graham, a wild party girl with a rap sheet a mile long who was convicted of murder in the early 1950's and executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin Penitentiary.  The script whitewashes Graham's story, painting her as a more sympathetic character (i.e., ""innocent"") than she had been in real life, but Hayward comes through with a gutsy tour de force performance that provides the film with just the right amount of gritty toughness that elevates it out of the league of soap opera.  Her Barbara Graham may be a ""victim"" of circumstances and a flawed legal system, but she is also loud, vulgar, crude, flippant, and antisocial, often working against her own best interests.  And Hayward never hits a false note, provoking the audience to a strange mixture of contempt and compassion, repulsion and attraction.  By the final scenes of the film, when Graham is at San Quentin with execution imminent, Hayward is able to gear down and underplay; she's done such a masterful job with her character thus far that the audience feels - and doesn't really need to see or hear - the turmoil within Graham as she resigns herself to her inevitable fate.  It's a bravura piece of acting, and Hayward richly deserved the Oscar she won.The DVD is amazingly clear and sharp.  The black and white cinematography is brilliant; the shadows in some of the San Quentin sequences - especially those in which the death chamber is readied - are startling.  And the film-to-video transfer is flawless; watching on a large screen TV, I could actually see the freckles on Miss Hayward's collarbone and define the ridges on her fingernails in some of the final closeup shots.  Happily, the Original Theatrical Trailer is included on the disc; what a shocker it must have been to movie-goers at the time since it includes the famous scene of Hayward being led back to her prison cell repeatedly screaming the profanity that Rhett Butler almost didn't get to utter on screen less than 20 years earlier! Definitely a must-have DVD for fans of great screen acting ...",5,"She Wanted an Oscar!

414265,A1L43KWWR05PCS,630430840X,Lawyeraau,"[19, 21]","This film was extolled at the time as ""one of the year's top dramas"" by Variety.  It is based upon the  true story of convicted murderess Barbara Graham. In it, Susan Hayward, a beautiful and previously  underrated actress, gives a performance that won her the 1958 Academy Award for Best Actress. She plays the role of Barbara Graham, a young woman who went to the gas chamber in California for the murder of  an elderly woman  who was killed during the course of a burglary/robbery.Barbara Graham was a  beautiful young woman, a graduate from the school of hard knocks. She was an amoral, hard-living party girl, who, together with her friend, Peg (Virginia Vincent) , spent her time boozing and looking for love in all the wrong places. Susan and Peg would both eventually come to a fork in the road that would end up being a crossroad in each of their lives. Peg took one fork and ended up marrying Mr. Right, living a normal life. Barbara took the other fork and began a downward spiral that ultimately would not bode well for her. Barbara had a knack for surrounding herself with those for whom the lowest common denominator was the standard.  She ended up marrying Mr. Wrong, and it is no surprise when her marriage heads south. With her marriage on its last legs, Barbara ends up leaving her husband and dropping their baby off to live with its paternal grandmother,Barbara opts to hang around the wrong crowd, moving in with a former associate who, along with some of his cronies, has just done something very bad. It appears that they killed an elderly woman  during a botched burglary/robbery. When all of them, including Barbara, are arrested for this crime, Barbara is left holding the bag, framed by the actual killers for something for which she claims to be innocent. Once accused of this heinous crime, she is pilloried in the press,  railroaded by the blood lust of the fourth estate. The press portrays her in the headlines of the day as ""Bloody Babs"",  a wanton killer without a conscience who pistol-whipped an elderly woman to death.  Moreover, Barbara continues to make bad choices that only serve to solidify the case against her. She is ultimately tried, convicted, and sentenced to die in the gas chamber.The film focuses on Barbara's supposed innocence in the capital murder of which she is accused, making it seem as if she were nothing more than a victim of her penchant for making bad choices. Through the post-conviction, professional assessment of a  psychologist/criminologist named Carl (Theodore Bikel), the film establishes the supposition that Barbara is incapable of the violence mandated by the crime for which she is to be executed. A reporter, Edward Montgomery (Simon Oakland), also gets into the act on this issue, as he ends up doing a three hundred and sixty degree turnaround in terms of his belief as to her involvement in the murder. He tries to rally the public to  Barbara's now frantic cause, using the very same medium that had previously excoriated her.The last half hour or so of the film is a tense one, as the film moves inexorably towards the execution, while efforts to stave off the inevitable by those who believe in Barbara's innocence are stymied at every turn. The methodical preparations for Barbara's execution, as well as the preparation of the gas chamber itself, are a stark reminder of the reality of this now antiquated form of execution.  It is a grim, relentless, and chilling depiction.  It is especially so, as the film is slanted to tug at the viewer's heartstrings by making it appear that Barbara Graham was  totally innocent.  In reality, the facts were quite different. While Barbara may not have been the actual killer, there is little doubt that she was guilty, as she acted in concert with the killers and was fully involved, facilitating the events that brought about the death of the elderly woman in question. The real Barbara Graham  was no passive gun moll.Susan Hayward gives a fine performance as Barbara Graham, though it is somewhat dated in style. She makes Barbara into a somewhat pitiable character, a bad girl who is really a good girl down deep, and who, but for her knack for making bad choices, might have ended up living a much different and better kind of life. Ms. Hayward gives a basically unlikable, hard-edged character a vulnerability that makes the viewer root for her and hope for an eleventh hour reprieve. The supporting cast also give excellent performances. Moreover, the jazz laced score adds the right kind of moody, edgy ambiance to the film, setting the right tone for this true crime/prison  drama. This film, deftly directed by Robert Wise, is well worth seeing.",4,THOSE WHO WATCH THIS FILM WILL ALSO WANT HER TO LIVE...,1108252800,"02 13, 2005",2005,4679,"['film', 'was', 'extolled', 'time', 'one', 'year', 'top', 'dramas', 'Variety', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'convicted', 'murderess', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'beautiful', 'previously', 'underrated', 'actress', 'performance', 'won', '1958', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'role', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'went', 'gas', 'chamber', 'California', 'murder', 'elderly', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'killed', 'course', 'burglary/robbery.Barbara', 'Graham', 'was', 'beautiful', 'young', 'woman', 'graduate', 'school', 'hard', 'knocks', 'was', 'amoral', 'hard-living', 'party', 'girl', 'who', 'together', 'friend', 'Peg', 'Virginia', 'Vincent', 'spent', 'time', 'boozing', 'looking', 'love', 'wrong', 'places', 'Susan', 'Peg', 'would', 'both', 'eventually', 'come', 'fork', 'road', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'being', 'crossroad', 'lives', 'Peg', 'took', 'one', 'fork', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'Mr', 'Right', 'living', 'normal', 'life', 'Barbara', 'took', 'other', 'fork', 'began', 'downward', 'spiral', 'ultimately', 'would', 'not', 'bode', 'well', 'Barbara', 'had', 'knack', 'surrounding', 'whom', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'was', 'standard', 'ended', 'up', 'marrying', 'Mr.', 'Wrong', 'surprise', 'when', 'marriage', 'heads', 'south', 'marriage', 'last', 'legs', 'Barbara', 'up', 'leaving', 'husband', 'dropping', 'baby', 'live', 'paternal', 'grandmother', 'Barbara', 'hang', 'wrong', 'crowd', 'moving', 'former', 'associate', 'who', 'cronies', 'just', 'done', 'something', 'very', 'bad', 'killed', 'elderly', 'woman', 'botched', 'burglary/robbery', 'When', 'including', 'Barbara', 'are', 'arrested', 'crime', 'Barbara', 'left', 'holding', 'bag', 'framed', 'actual', 'killers', 'something', 'be', 'innocent', 'Once', 'accused', 'heinous', 'crime', 'pilloried', 'press', 'railroaded', 'blood', 'lust', 'fourth', 'estate', 'press', 'headlines', 'day', 'Bloody', 'Babs', 'wanton', 'killer', 'conscience', 'who', 'pistol-whipped', 'elderly', 'woman', 'death', 'Moreover', 'Barbara', 'make', 'bad', 'choices', 'only', 'serve', 'solidify', 'case', 'ultimately', 'tried', 'convicted', 'sentenced', 'die', 'gas', 'chamber.The', 'film', 'Barbara', 'supposed', 'innocence', 'capital', 'murder', 'accused', 'making', 'seem', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'victim', 'penchant', 'making', 'bad', 'choices', 'post-conviction', 'professional', 'assessment', 'psychologist/criminologist', 'named', 'Carl', 'Theodore', 'Bikel', 'film', 'supposition', 'Barbara', 'incapable', 'violence', 'mandated', 'crime', 'be', 'executed', 'reporter', 'Edward', 'Montgomery', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'also', 'act', 'issue', 'up', 'doing', 'three', 'hundred', 'sixty', 'degree', 'turnaround', 'terms', 'belief', 'involvement', 'murder', 'rally', 'public', 'Barbara', 'now', 'frantic', 'cause', 'using', 'very', 'same', 'medium', 'had', 'previously', 'excoriated', 'her.The', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'so', 'film', 'tense', 'one', 'film', 'inexorably', 'execution', 'efforts', 'stave', 'off', 'inevitable', 'who', 'believe', 'Barbara', 'innocence', 'are', 'stymied', 'turn', 'methodical', 'preparations', 'Barbara', 'execution', 'as', 'well', 'preparation', 'gas', 'chamber', 'are', 'stark', 'reminder', 'reality', 'now', 'antiquated', 'form', 'execution', 'grim', 'relentless', 'chilling', 'depiction', 'especially', 'so', 'film', 'slanted', 'tug', 'viewer', 'heartstrings', 'making', 'appear', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'was', 'totally', 'innocent', 'reality', 'facts', 'were', 'quite', 'different', 'Barbara', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'actual', 'killer', 'little', 'doubt', 'was', 'guilty', 'acted', 'concert', 'killers', 'was', 'fully', 'involved', 'facilitating', 'events', 'brought', 'death', 'elderly', 'woman', 'question', 'real', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'was', 'passive', 'gun', 'moll.Susan', 'Hayward', 'fine', 'performance', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'somewhat', 'dated', 'style', 'Barbara', 'somewhat', 'pitiable', 'character', 'bad', 'girl', 'who', 'really', 'good', 'girl', 'down', 'deep', 'who', 'knack', 'making', 'bad', 'choices', 'might', 'have', 'ended', 'up', 'living', 'much', 'different', 'better', 'kind', 'life', 'Ms.', 'Hayward', 'basically', 'unlikable', 'hard-edged', 'character', 'vulnerability', 'viewer', 'root', 'hope', 'eleventh', 'hour', 'reprieve', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'give', 'excellent', 'performances', 'Moreover', 'jazz', 'laced', 'score', 'right', 'kind', 'moody', 'edgy', 'ambiance', 'film', 'setting', 'right', 'tone', 'true', 'crime/prison', 'drama', 'film', 'deftly', 'directed', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'well', 'worth', 'seeing']",I Want to Live VHS

Susan Hayward won an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of of party girl Graham. Here we see film noir, the marginalized fifties' film genre, enter into the Hollywood mainstream. Director Robert Wise uses harrowing black and white cinematography and a jagged, jazz-oriented musical score to emphasize  Graham's isolation from the larger society. Graham was a petty criminal and an assertive, tough woman who had to fend for herself. When one of her accomplices asks her, ""whaddayado?"" she answers truthfully--""I do what I have to."" This 1958 film, which calls into question the ""justice"" in the criminal justice system, looks ahead to the social upheaval of the sixties when the both the antiwar and the civil rights movement would put America on the carpet. The film also, in the figure of reporter Ed Montgomery, shows how her case became a media juggernaut that became impossible to stop, even when her innocence became evident. Graham's absolute powerlessness in the film reminds reminds us how little power women had in the male-dominated postwar era. Hayward was an amazingly talented, instinctual actress--and perfect for this role. Graham wasn't an introspective woman and Hayward wasn't an introspective actress. Hayward was on Graham's wavelength, so to speak, and her performance here is uncanny. This film is definitely an American classic.",5,"""Get your paws off!

414270,A1GF7BR6K22GZD,630430840X,Mark Norvell,"[24, 25]","A memorable film from the 50's based allegedly on the true story of a woman named Barbara Graham who went to the gas chamber for a murder she swore she didn't commit. As played by Susan Hayward (who won an Oscar), Graham is a party girl and sometime thief/prostitute involved with some very shady small time crooks. An old woman is robbed and killed in the process and the crooks let Graham take the rap. Graham is also the mother of a small child---an angle played up in the press as she waves her son's toy tiger at the cameras. What sticks in your mind, though, are the scenes where she's back and forth from her death row cell to the gas chamber as she waits anxiously for a stay from the governor.

It's an anti-capital punishment tract about Barbara Graham, a petty crime hustler who became the first woman  gassed to death by the State of California. Although found guilty by a jury, the movie infers her innocence, framed by fellow low-lifes for the robbery murder of a widow.Hayward, a true studio star, pulls out all the emotional stops and exercises all her actressy tricks: the cocky defiance, the lightening twist of neck and body, the abrasive voice, the soulful eyes, etc. She accumulated enough of them in her career to create a distinctive acting style. Sooner or later Oscar was bound to come calling. ""I Want to Live!"" isn't a bad movie, as polemics go, but it's such a dishonest one that even Hayward's crafty hysteria can't totally redeem it (a terrifc jazz score helps, however.)It stresses her love for her son, ignoring the other children she had and neglected; it asserts her innocence, never mind her last minute confession to San Quentin's warden; it gives us a ""good time party girl"" instead of the cheap prostitute, heroin junkie and proud ex-con Graham herself said she was. Here she enters the gas chamber a martyr, surrounded at her request by the very reporters who vilified her, and emerges an anti-death penalty icon.Hayward's husband, Walter Wagner, produced on a low-budget that oddly complements the loud, tawdry locales and characters. Simon Oakland plays the real reporter upon whose trashy exposes the picture is partly based (his change of heart is briefly conveyed.) Director Robert Wise does ellicit some pity for Graham in the tensely detailed preamble to her execution, which ends the film. And that's doubtless when Hollywood began engraving Hayward's Oscar.",3,Desperately Seeking Oscar,1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,1914,"['slighting', 'nominated', 'work', ""'ll"", 'Cry', 'Tomorrow', 'Smash-Up', 'Song', 'My', 'Heart', 'better', 'pictures', 'performances', 'Hollywood', 'finally', 'gave', 'Susan', 'Hayward', 'Oscar', 'true', 'crime', 'drama', 'anti-capital', 'punishment', 'tract', 'Barbara', 'Graham', 'petty', 'crime', 'hustler', 'who', 'became', 'first', 'woman', 'gassed', 'death', 'State', 'California', 'found', 'guilty', 'jury', 'movie', 'innocence', 'framed', 'fellow', 'low-lifes', 'robbery', 'murder', 'widow.Hayward', 'true', 'studio', 'star', 'out', 'emotional', 'stops', 'actressy', 'tricks', 'cocky', 'defiance', 'lightening', 'twist', 'neck', 'body', 'abrasive', 'voice', 'soulful', 'eyes', 'etc', 'accumulated', 'enough', 'career', 'create', 'distinctive', 'acting', 'style', 'Sooner', 'later', 'Oscar', 'was', 'bound', 'come', 'calling', 'Want', 'Live', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'polemics', 'go', 'such', 'dishonest', 'one', 'even', 'Hayward', 'crafty', 'hysteria', 'ca', ""n't"", 'totally', 'redeem', 'terrifc', 'jazz', 'score', 'however', 'love', 'son', 'ignoring', 'other', 'children', 'had', 'neglected', 'innocence', 'never', 'last', 'minute', 'confession', 'San', 'Quentin', 'warden', 'good', 'time', 'party', 'girl', 'instead', 'cheap', 'prostitute', 'heroin', 'junkie', 'proud', 'ex-con', 'Graham', 'herself', 'said', 'was', 'Here', 'gas', 'chamber', 'martyr', 'surrounded', 'request', 'very', 'reporters', 'who', 'vilified', 'anti-death', 'penalty', 'icon.Hayward', 'husband', 'Walter', 'Wagner', 'produced', 'low-budget', 'oddly', 'loud', 'tawdry', 'locales', 'characters', 'Simon', 'Oakland', 'real', 'reporter', 'trashy', 'picture', 'partly', 'based', 'change', 'heart', 'briefly', 'conveyed', 'Director', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'ellicit', 'pity', 'Graham', 'tensely', 'detailed', 'preamble', 'execution', 'film', 'doubtless', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'began', 'engraving', 'Hayward', 'Oscar']",I Want to Live VHS
