63546,A3C6CZC2JP67VK,0783230494,"Jenny J.J.I. ""A New Yorker""","[3, 4]","""Major Payne"" is one of the funniest movies that I enjoy to watch over and over again. I thought that Damon Wayans delivered a knockout performance as the loud-mouthed, gold-toothed, trash talking, squeaky voiced Major Benson Winifred Payne. He was so funny that I nearly had a heart attack while laughing at the same time.After a major drug bust goes extremely well in South America, Major Payne (Damon Wayans) returns to Parris Island, South Carolina and finds out that the U.S. Marine Corps is throwing him out of the military back into civilian life. After two weeks of civilian life, Payne is let back into the military under one condition: go to Virginia and train a group of delinquents for an ROTC program at Madison Academy. Payne regretfully accepts the job and puts each of the boys into 8 weeks of living hell! It becomes a fight because the boys do what they can to put Major Payne out of their lives!I have so many favorites scene through out this movie but the one that shines the brightest is when Wayans had a dance sequence at a club where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice ""robot""), and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. Many of the gags are side-splitting funny, and the vocal tones and mannerisms of Major Payne are just spot-on hilarious. And the kids in the film do a remarkable job in their supporting roles. The kids in fact steal the show (especially the younger ones). Lots of absurdity in the movie, but still here and there peeks through a poignant maturity on the deeper symbolism of what boot camp is all aboutOf course, it is a feel good movie so you know everything will work out in the end. Base on some of the lower reviews you can see that this movie is not for everyone, but at the same time is worth seeing. If you don't like it by the time Payne does his ""Failure to communicate!"" line then maybe it isn't for you. As for me it's utterly brilliant.",4,Major Payne has hurt my sides with laughter.,1162166400,"10 30, 2006",2006,1913,"['Major', 'Payne', 'one', 'funniest', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'thought', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'delivered', 'knockout', 'performance', 'loud-mouthed', 'gold-toothed', 'trash', 'talking', 'squeaky', 'voiced', 'Major', 'Benson', 'Winifred', 'Payne', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'nearly', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'laughing', 'same', 'time.After', 'major', 'drug', 'bust', 'extremely', 'well', 'South', 'America', 'Major', 'Payne', 'Damon', 'Wayans', 'Parris', 'Island', 'South', 'Carolina', 'out', 'U.S.', 'Marine', 'Corps', 'throwing', 'military', 'back', 'civilian', 'life', 'two', 'weeks', 'civilian', 'life', 'Payne', 'let', 'back', 'military', 'one', 'condition', 'go', 'Virginia', 'train', 'group', 'delinquents', 'ROTC', 'program', 'Madison', 'Academy', 'Payne', 'regretfully', 'job', 'boys', '8', 'weeks', 'living', 'hell', 'fight', 'boys', 'do', 'what', 'can', 'put', 'Major', 'Payne', 'lives', 'have', 'so', 'many', 'favorites', 'scene', 'movie', 'one', 'brightest', 'when', 'Wayans', 'had', 'dance', 'sequence', 'club', 'where', 'series', 'moves', 'including', 'very', 'nice', 'robot', 'help', 'music', '2', 'Live', 'Crew', 'Many', 'gags', 'are', 'side-splitting', 'funny', 'vocal', 'tones', 'mannerisms', 'Major', 'Payne', 'are', 'just', 'spot-on', 'hilarious', 'kids', 'film', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'supporting', 'roles', 'kids', 'fact', 'steal', 'show', 'especially', 'younger', 'ones', 'Lots', 'absurdity', 'movie', 'still', 'here', 'there', 'poignant', 'maturity', 'deeper', 'symbolism', 'what', 'boot', 'camp', 'aboutOf', 'course', 'feel', 'good', 'movie', 'know', 'everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'end', 'Base', 'lower', 'reviews', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'not', 'everyone', 'same', 'time', 'worth', 'seeing', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'time', 'Payne', 'Failure', 'communicate', 'line', 'then', 'maybe', ""n't"", 'utterly', 'brilliant']",N/A

63576,AEDLJZMLDDGWA,0783230494,"Sith Warlord ""Sith Warlord""","[2, 4]","Major Payne is hillarious. Both children and adults will be laughing throughout this fun and silly movie.Damon Williams does a superb job playing a comically overly strict drill instructor who takes over the education of a bunch of misfit ROTC students at a private school.Upon finding the children to be extremely undisciplined, Payne decides to shave their heads. The next scene depicts the boys feeling their newly shaved heads in disbeif as Williams barks orders at them. The laughs only increase as this funny movie moves on. If you like comedy movies, Major Payne is a must see. The plot is a little on the thin side, but the movie more than makes up for it with humor. My son actually watched the VHS version of this movie so many times that the tape broke. He has every line in the movie memorized, and it is among his favorites. Because of the breakage, I decided to purchase the DVD version for him for Christmas.
