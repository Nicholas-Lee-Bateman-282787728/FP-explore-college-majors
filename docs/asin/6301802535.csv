It rewards, never mind the cloying dvd cover. Not just a Temple vehicle, it covers other ground.  If chemistry is a major component of a succesful film, the relationship between Miss Temple and Victor McLaglen and the affection elicited by Cesar Romero for the youngster is great cinema. Full of many nice Ford touches; vignettes of interelationships held together during the drama of impending war.  (And perhaps to mitigate the Shirley Temple factor, Ford includes a disturbing scene of a mentally defective spy getting tossed from a fortress wall like the day's trash in stark contrast to the heartfelt tenor of the film.

Since it was also part of a John Ford boxed set, it underwent an extensive overhaul (about 77 hours according to the background information on the DVD). Original elements at Fox were unusable for ""Winkie,"" but the final result is very good. There is NO colorized version to choose from here, but rather a sepia-tone version, just as the film was originally released. For film buffs, this is a plus!""Wee Willie Winkie"" (1937) VERY loosely based on Rudyard Kipling's popular story. Taken by her mother (June Lang) to live in India, a young girl (Temple) gradually wins the heart of her feisty grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a colonel at a British army outpost. Before long, she captures the hearts of his entire regiment as well as his chief enemy (Cesar Romero), using her charms to prevent a full-scale war. Directed by John Ford; definitely one of Temple's best films, thanks to the chemistry between Temple & Romero, and Temple & Victor McLaglen (get the hankies out for one of their scenes). Presented as a flipper disc featuring a tinted version of the film (in a very pleasing sepia tone) that was based on original notes and research to make the film look as it was first released as well as the black and white original, both in their original full-screen theatrical aspect ratio. With English Stereo plus English and Spanish Mono, the feature also includes English, French and Spanish subtitles. 100 minutes.

269719,A10Q8NIFOVOHFV,6301802535,Robert S. Clay Jr.,"[4, 5]","For anyone who hasn't already seen it, this movie is a pleasant surprise.  It tells a rip-snortin' adventure yarn without sacrificing the familiar sentimental elements of a typical Shirley Temple movie.  There isn't much  of the usual light-hearted singing and dancing, but Shirley's infectious  charm manages to shine through in the story of a young girl in 19th century  India.  Cesar Romero plays Khoda Khan, the rebel leader who wants the  British out of his country.  C. Aubrey Smith plays Shirley's no-nonsense  grandfather, Colonel Williams, commanding the British military outpost.  The tough soldiers, especially Sergeant MacDuff (Victor McLaglen),  immediately fall under Shirley's spell, and make her the regiment mascot,  &quot;Private Winkie.&quot;  Shirley also charms Khoda Khan while he is  held in the garrison jail.  (If she could bottle it, she would make a  fortune).  After Khoda Khan escapes to his rocky fortress, Shirley, with  the help of the slightly mad Mohammet Dihn (Willie Fung), follows Khan,  seeks to appease his anger at her grandfather, and tries to bring the two  men together in peace.  Shirley stomping her foot in frustration before the  howling rebel chieftains and calling them &quot;...very, very mean!&quot;  because nobody takes her seriously is a great moment in this movie.  Believing the rebels have kidnapped his granddaughter, Colonel Williams  leads the regiment against the great steps of the rebel fortress, and  bloody conflict looms.This movie succeeds for several reasons.  Shirley  Temple in an action-adventure flick sounds unlikely, but the result is  delightfully entertaining.  The portrayal of British colonialism reminds  the viewer of movies such as &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and Errol Flynn's  &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade.&quot;  John Ford's direction adds a  comfortable blend of action, sentiment, and humor.  In characteristic John  Ford fashion, there is effective use of music (pipes and drums), especially  during an emotionally wrenching military funeral segment.  Shirley Temple  had progressed from her &quot;Good Ship Lollipop&quot; days, and presents a  slightly more grownup version of America's sweetheart.  Don't worry!  Her  trademark curls are intact.  Cesar Romero, obviously not Indian, does well  as the melancholy rebel chief.  C. Aubrey Smith is appropriately  Kiplingesque as the stuffy colonel.

269721,A2ZKKJKTBKJYEK,6301802535,"""sopera""","[23, 25]","This is an outstanding movie. What makes it so fantastic is that it isn't just a great Shirley Temple vehicle...it's a great FILM all the way around. The director, John Ford, the supporting cast, including Victor McLaglen and Caesar Romero, and the production values are all top of the line.The story seems predictable at first--once again, Shirley's precocious character, Priscilla, is missing a parent (this time, her father). As in some of her other films, she goes to live in a new environment with a grumpy older relative (this time, her grandfather, a British military general).This is where the similarities end, however. Priscilla decides she isn't content sitting at home with her Mum, sewing samplers--she wants to join the Queen's Army. With the help of Sgt. MacDuff (McLaglen), she procures an official uniform, learns the drills, and adopts a military name--Wee Willie Winkie (the name, by and by, comes from a Scottish nursery rhyme). She also dabbles in international diplomacy by striking up a friendship with the Indian leader jailed in the army camp, Khoda Khan (Romero). When Khan's chieftains attack the base, it's up to Winkie to find a way to achieve peace.One neat thing about this film is the theme of empowerment it has for young girls. It was made in 1937, and set in the prim-and-proper Victorian era--and it was about a little girl joining the army! Priscilla holds her own among the soldiers--at one point in the film, unhappy with a decree made by her grandfather, she storms into his office to argue about it (and she wins the argument!). The film sends the message that girls CAN do anything--be it sew or march in the army.There is also a strong message of peace, in spite of all the military trappings--the battle between the British and Indian forces is not solved with guns or cannons, but through mediation. Winkie impresses her fellow soliders not by killing people, but by using her head and thinking things through.Ford's direction is beautiful, and the script is strong. There are several extremely memorable scenes: the one that stands out in my mind is at the end of the film, when Khoda Khan, Winkie and the British general meet on a hill, surrounded by British and Indian troops.Temple is wonderful in this--it is probably her strongest dramatic film and one of the best story-wise. She actually did her own stunts in this film--the scene where she ran across the path of the stampeding horses wasn't done with camera tricks!  McLaglen is endearing as Sgt. MacDuff. Romero is also phenomenal--he makes Khoda Khan much more than a one-dimensional villain.No, this isn't a light, happy musical. It IS, however, a film with a lot going for it, and definitely worthwhile.",5,Fantastic,987984000,"04 23, 2001",2001,2712,"['outstanding', 'movie', 'What', 'so', 'fantastic', ""n't"", 'just', 'great', 'Shirley', 'Temple', 'vehicle', 'great', 'FILM', 'way', 'director', 'John', 'Ford', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Victor', 'McLaglen', 'Caesar', 'Romero', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'top', 'line.The', 'story', 'predictable', 'first', 'once', 'again', 'Shirley', 'precocious', 'character', 'Priscilla', 'missing', 'parent', 'time', 'father', 'other', 'films', 'live', 'new', 'environment', 'grumpy', 'older', 'relative', 'time', 'grandfather', 'British', 'military', 'general', '.This', 'where', 'similarities', 'end', 'however', 'Priscilla', ""n't"", 'content', 'sitting', 'home', 'Mum', 'sewing', 'samplers', 'join', 'Queen', 'Army', 'help', 'Sgt', 'MacDuff', 'McLaglen', 'official', 'uniform', 'drills', 'military', 'name', 'Wee', 'Willie', 'Winkie', 'name', 'Scottish', 'nursery', 'rhyme', 'also', 'international', 'diplomacy', 'striking', 'up', 'friendship', 'Indian', 'leader', 'jailed', 'army', 'camp', 'Khoda', 'Khan', 'Romero', 'When', 'Khan', 'chieftains', 'attack', 'base', 'up', 'Winkie', 'find', 'way', 'achieve', 'peace.One', 'neat', 'thing', 'film', 'theme', 'empowerment', 'young', 'girls', 'was', 'made', '1937', 'set', 'prim-and-proper', 'Victorian', 'era', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'joining', 'army', 'Priscilla', 'own', 'soldiers', 'one', 'point', 'film', 'unhappy', 'decree', 'made', 'grandfather', 'office', 'argue', 'argument', 'film', 'message', 'girls', 'CAN', 'do', 'anything', 'be', 'sew', 'march', 'army.There', 'also', 'strong', 'message', 'peace', 'spite', 'military', 'trappings', 'battle', 'British', 'Indian', 'forces', 'not', 'solved', 'guns', 'cannons', 'mediation', 'Winkie', 'fellow', 'soliders', 'not', 'killing', 'people', 'using', 'head', 'thinking', 'things', 'through.Ford', 'direction', 'beautiful', 'script', 'strong', 'are', 'several', 'extremely', 'memorable', 'scenes', 'one', 'out', 'mind', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Khoda', 'Khan', 'Winkie', 'British', 'general', 'meet', 'hill', 'surrounded', 'British', 'Indian', 'troops.Temple', 'wonderful', 'probably', 'strongest', 'dramatic', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'story-wise', 'actually', 'did', 'own', 'stunts', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'ran', 'path', 'stampeding', 'horses', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'camera', 'tricks', 'McLaglen', 'endearing', 'Sgt', 'MacDuff', 'Romero', 'also', 'phenomenal', 'Khoda', 'Khan', 'much', 'more', 'one-dimensional', 'villain.No', ""n't"", 'light', 'happy', 'musical', 'however', 'film', 'lot', 'going', 'definitely', 'worthwhile']",Shirley Temple: Wee Willie Winkie VHS
269722,A2Q13PHEXGR48Q,6301802535,T O'Brien,"[0, 0]","Rudyard Kipling stories have always translated well to film and television, think The Jungle Book, The Man Who Would Be King, and Wee Willie Winkie is no exception.  In India in 1897, young Priscilla Williams and her mother Joyce are traveling by train to a remote British outpost commanded by Priscilla's grandfather.  Upon arriving, Priscilla finds out that her grandfather doesn't quite know how to interact with little girls so she decides her best option to get to know him is to become a soldier.  With the help of the friendly Sgt. Donald McDuff, Priscilla tries to become a soldier, and with a new name at that, Private Wee Willie Winkie.  There is something undescribable about this film that makes it so good.  It hits all the right notes throughout.  Seen through Wee Willie Winkie's eyes, everything is very innocent and child-like, an example being she can't see why the British and Indians are at war.  All this just makes the movie work that much better.  Everything is working well here, so don't miss this movie.Shirley Temple gives one of her best performances as Priscilla Williams, a precocious little girl who is always curious and therefore always asking questions.  She's able to do the comedic and dramatic scenes equally well.  Victor McLagen is incredible as Sgt. Donald MacDuff, the soldier who befriends Priscilla and teaches her to become a soldier, giving her a new name and a pint size uniform, toy rifle and all.  Temple and McLaglen's scenes together are what takes this movie from a very good to a great movie, especially their last scene together.  It's too bad the always reliable McLaglen didn't get some kind of recognition for his role here.  C. Aubrey Smith plays Colonel Williams, Priscilla's grandfather and commander of the post who initially doesn't know how to interact with his granddaughter but ends up becoming very close.  June Lang is good in a small part as Joyce, Priscilla's widowed mother trying to adjust to her new life with a crush on the outpost, ""Coppy"" as Priscilla calls him, Lt. Brandes.  And a young Cesar Romero rounds out the main cast as Khoda Khan, a leader of the Indian opposition to the British.  He too has some very strong scenes with Temple.Now, I haven't seen the VHS so I can't answer to its quality, but the movie is now available in DVD format as part of the ""Ford at Fox"" collection.  I can't say you should buy the whole set, it's pretty expensive, for one movie, but if you like John Ford movies, especially his early ones, then the set is a safe buy.  The disc for Wee Willie Winkie doesn't have any special features, but it offers the black and white version and the tinted version.  Th B&W; version looks very good and cleaned up from some TV versions.  So if you get a chance, watch Wee Willie Winkie, you won't be disappointed!",5,"Classic John Ford with Shirley Temple, Victor McLaglen",1199145600,"01 1, 2008",2008,2812,"['Rudyard', 'Kipling', 'stories', 'have', 'always', 'translated', 'well', 'film', 'television', 'think', 'Jungle', 'Book', 'Man', 'Who', 'Would', 'Be', 'King', 'Wee', 'Willie', 'Winkie', 'exception', 'India', '1897', 'young', 'Priscilla', 'Williams', 'mother', 'Joyce', 'are', 'traveling', 'train', 'remote', 'British', 'outpost', 'commanded', 'Priscilla', 'grandfather', 'arriving', 'Priscilla', 'out', 'grandfather', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'how', 'interact', 'little', 'girls', 'best', 'option', 'get', 'know', 'become', 'soldier', 'help', 'friendly', 'Sgt', 'Donald', 'McDuff', 'Priscilla', 'become', 'soldier', 'new', 'name', 'Private', 'Wee', 'Willie', 'Winkie', 'something', 'undescribable', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'right', 'notes', 'Seen', 'Wee', 'Willie', 'Winkie', 'eyes', 'everything', 'very', 'innocent', 'child-like', 'example', 'being', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'why', 'British', 'Indians', 'are', 'war', 'just', 'movie', 'work', 'much', 'better', 'Everything', 'working', 'well', 'here', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'movie.Shirley', 'Temple', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'Priscilla', 'Williams', 'precocious', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'always', 'curious', 'therefore', 'always', 'asking', 'questions', 'able', 'do', 'comedic', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'equally', 'well', 'Victor', 'McLagen', 'incredible', 'Sgt', 'Donald', 'MacDuff', 'soldier', 'who', 'Priscilla', 'become', 'soldier', 'giving', 'new', 'name', 'pint', 'size', 'uniform', 'toy', 'rifle', 'Temple', 'McLaglen', 'scenes', 'together', 'are', 'what', 'movie', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'movie', 'especially', 'last', 'scene', 'together', 'too', 'bad', 'always', 'reliable', 'McLaglen', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'kind', 'recognition', 'role', 'here', 'C.', 'Aubrey', 'Smith', 'Colonel', 'Williams', 'Priscilla', 'grandfather', 'commander', 'post', 'who', 'initially', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'interact', 'granddaughter', 'up', 'becoming', 'very', 'close', 'June', 'Lang', 'good', 'small', 'part', 'Joyce', 'Priscilla', 'widowed', 'mother', 'trying', 'adjust', 'new', 'life', 'crush', 'outpost', 'Coppy', 'Priscilla', 'Lt.', 'Brandes', 'young', 'Cesar', 'Romero', 'out', 'main', 'cast', 'Khoda', 'Khan', 'leader', 'Indian', 'opposition', 'British', 'too', 'very', 'strong', 'scenes', 'Temple.Now', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'VHS', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'quality', 'movie', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'format', 'part', 'Ford', 'Fox', 'collection', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'should', 'buy', 'whole', 'set', 'pretty', 'expensive', 'one', 'movie', 'like', 'John', 'Ford', 'movies', 'especially', 'early', 'ones', 'then', 'set', 'safe', 'buy', 'disc', 'Wee', 'Willie', 'Winkie', ""n't"", 'have', 'special', 'features', 'black', 'white', 'version', 'tinted', 'version', 'Th', 'B', 'W', 'version', 'very', 'good', 'cleaned', 'up', 'TV', 'versions', 'So', 'get', 'chance', 'watch', 'Wee', 'Willie', 'Winkie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed']",Shirley Temple: Wee Willie Winkie VHS
