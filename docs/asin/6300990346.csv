""First Man into Space"" scared the bejeezus out of us. We were so scared we couldn't stop crying. They had to take us out of the movie in the middle--sometime after the car was pulled over by the state trooper.  I thus never saw its conclusion. A few years ago I found the video of the movie and I triumphantly brought it home to show to my teenagers.

This post-Sputnik, pre-Gagarin flick evokes the newness and mystery of space flight in the Eisenhower years, but it's also a doozy of a monster movie, with a cool costume and several death scenes that were pretty gruesome for the time.

It's not on par with Invasion Of The Body Snatchers, Forbidden Planet, Gojira, nor The Day The Earth Stood Still, but it's amongst the better entries in the second tier, and a good deal of the `believability factor' has to be credited to the always underrated Marshall Thompson. In both presence and ability, he was one of the few B film actors it can honestly be said it was a shame that he wasted his talent in them. The obvious exemplar of this was Vincent Price, but not even Price could pull off military and leading man roles the way Thompson did. And, although he eventually did garner some level of fame on television, to me, he will always be best recalled in such films as this, where the joy received, especially to young boys, was always far greater than it reasonably should have been.

242051,AYTGG6XTVUG7G,6300990346,Douglas A. Greenberg,"[27, 30]","This seemingly harmless, boilerplate fifties scifi &quot;thriller&quot; is  of special significance to me, which is the reason I purchased the VHS  version.  When I was eight years old, I attended a double feature matinee  at the Varsity Theater in Palo Alto, California.  The main feature was  Disney's &quot;Darby O'Gill and the Little People,&quot; a decent,  semi-comedic flick most well-known for being a showcase for a budding actor  named Sean Connery.  &quot;Darby&quot; included a few scary moments,  however, in which an animated &quot;banshee&quot; was shown floating  ominously in the evening sky.  Perhaps because of these briefly frightening  scenes, the geniuses in charge of putting together the double bill selected  &quot;First Man Into Space&quot; as the second feature.The results  were nothing short of disastrous.Although &quot;First Man&quot; seems  cheesy and at times downright plodding by today's frenetic standards for  scifi films, showing a movie that includes a mutated, cyclopic,  blood-drinking murderous monster to a crowd of under-ten children resulted  in pandemonium in the theater and countless youthful nightmares afterward.  I was so scared by the &quot;monster&quot; (I was certain it was going to  come bursting through my bedroom window) that I could not sleep alone for  several nights.Since I never forget to just what extent &quot;First  Man&quot; scared the bejibbers out of me was back in 1959, I eagerly  anticipated seeing the movie again some forty-plus years later.  Needless  to say, it was a very different experience the second time around.  The  &quot;monster,&quot; who actually was the &quot;first man into space&quot;  deformed by some mysterious variety of cosmic radiation, still appeared  slightly scary (the one staring eye was an inspired effect, truly).  But  overall, the film seemed slow, dull, and oh, so cheesy.  As other reviewers  have indicated, the plot line of the movie has some admirable elements,  with its &quot;pride goeth before a fall&quot; morality and the compassion  showed by the authorities in the final scenes.  But the film definitely  qualifies as fodder for ridicule and wisecracks a la the late (and much  missed) series, &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000.&quot;In seeing the  movie for the first time themselves, my own sons, far more jaded in terms  of what qualifies as &quot;frightening,&quot; politely commented that they  &quot;could see how the monster might be scary,&quot; but I confess they  were so bored by the production overall that it was all they could do to  keep from leaving the room prior to the conclusion.I guess to  appreciate some of the virtues of this not-bad-but-not-great fifties scifi  &quot;thriller,&quot; you hadda be there, in the dark, on a Saturday  afternoon with a hundred other terrified suburban kids.",3,One of those &quot;You had to be there at the time&quot; films,968457600,"09 9, 2000",2000,2831,"['seemingly', 'harmless', 'boilerplate', 'fifties', 'scifi', 'quot', 'thriller', 'quot', 'special', 'significance', 'reason', 'purchased', 'VHS', 'version', 'When', 'was', 'eight', 'years', 'old', 'attended', 'double', 'feature', 'matinee', 'Varsity', 'Theater', 'Palo', 'Alto', 'California', 'main', 'feature', 'was', 'Disney', 'quot', 'Darby', ""O'Gill"", 'Little', 'People', 'quot', 'decent', 'semi-comedic', 'flick', 'most', 'well-known', 'being', 'showcase', 'budding', 'actor', 'named', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'quot', 'Darby', 'quot', 'included', 'few', 'scary', 'moments', 'however', 'animated', 'quot', 'quot', 'was', 'shown', 'floating', 'ominously', 'evening', 'sky', 'Perhaps', 'briefly', 'frightening', 'scenes', 'geniuses', 'charge', 'putting', 'together', 'double', 'bill', 'selected', 'quot', 'First', 'Man', 'Into', 'Space', 'quot', 'second', 'feature.The', 'results', 'were', 'nothing', 'short', 'disastrous.Although', 'quot', 'First', 'Man', 'quot', 'cheesy', 'times', 'downright', 'plodding', 'today', 'frenetic', 'standards', 'scifi', 'films', 'showing', 'movie', 'mutated', 'cyclopic', 'blood-drinking', 'murderous', 'monster', 'crowd', 'under-ten', 'children', 'resulted', 'pandemonium', 'theater', 'countless', 'youthful', 'nightmares', 'afterward', 'was', 'so', 'scared', 'quot', 'monster', 'quot', 'was', 'certain', 'was', 'going', 'come', 'bursting', 'bedroom', 'window', 'could', 'not', 'sleep', 'alone', 'several', 'nights.Since', 'never', 'forget', 'just', 'what', 'extent', 'quot', 'First', 'Man', 'quot', 'scared', 'bejibbers', 'was', 'back', '1959', 'eagerly', 'anticipated', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again', 'forty-plus', 'years', 'later', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'experience', 'second', 'time', 'around', 'quot', 'monster', 'quot', 'who', 'actually', 'was', 'quot', 'first', 'man', 'space', 'quot', 'deformed', 'mysterious', 'variety', 'cosmic', 'radiation', 'still', 'appeared', 'slightly', 'scary', 'one', 'staring', 'eye', 'was', 'inspired', 'effect', 'truly', 'overall', 'film', 'seemed', 'slow', 'dull', 'oh', 'so', 'cheesy', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'indicated', 'plot', 'line', 'movie', 'admirable', 'elements', 'quot', 'goeth', 'fall', 'quot', 'morality', 'compassion', 'showed', 'authorities', 'final', 'scenes', 'film', 'definitely', 'fodder', 'ridicule', 'la', 'late', 'much', 'missed', 'series', 'quot', 'Mystery', 'Science', 'Theater', '3000.', 'quot', 'seeing', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'own', 'sons', 'far', 'more', 'jaded', 'terms', 'what', 'quot', 'frightening', 'quot', 'politely', 'commented', 'quot', 'could', 'see', 'how', 'monster', 'might', 'be', 'scary', 'quot', 'confess', 'were', 'so', 'bored', 'production', 'overall', 'was', 'could', 'do', 'keep', 'leaving', 'room', 'prior', 'conclusion.I', 'guess', 'appreciate', 'virtues', 'not-bad-but-not-great', 'fifties', 'scifi', 'quot', 'thriller', 'quot', 'hadda', 'be', 'there', 'dark', 'Saturday', 'afternoon', 'hundred', 'other', 'terrified', 'suburban', 'kids']",N/A

The disc's only extras are its scene access menu and a theatrical trailer.FIRST MAN INTO SPACE is the story of a young, tenacious fighter pilot  who, as the title suggests, wants to be the first man into space.  His  brother, who is also his commanding officer, tries to keep him in line.  After a slow-paced 30 minutes, the fighter pilot crash-lands on Earth after  successfully flying 250 miles up into the outer limits.  He has been  changed into the monster wearing a baggy rubber suit you see on the cover.Fans of cheesy, late night horror movies will find this movie somewhat  fun.  It does have a &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; feel to it.  There are, however, much better films from the 1950s that are cheesier.  This one just doesn't have the feel and the pace of those bad B-movies that  fans like to watch again and again.  FIRST MAN INTO SPACE is okay but not  great.
