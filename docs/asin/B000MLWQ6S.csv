1046902,A1PASRZ81DY9C,B000MLWQ6S,Austin Somlo,"[0, 0]","Viewed: 6/13Rate: 4/56/13: Miami Vice: Season Three is a tale of two halves. The first two seasons had the greatest opening credits ever, but it got reedited for the third season. What an awful change. The first half shows the recovery of its edge that the series was missing since Season One and features the best stuff the series has ever done. I would like to think that having Dick Wolf, responsible for the Law & Order television show, on board has everything to do with that. However, gone are the pastel colors and the distinctive Miami Vice style that Michael Mann started with in Season One. Season Three is noticeably darker and more right to the point. One improvement about it is the replacement of Ferrari Daytona Spyder with the Testarossa (much better). Blood is now realistically shown as people are shot whereas in the past there were no visible wounds as the bad guys kept going down. Another is Don Johnson's smoking habits. Not a single drag was taken in the entire season compared to the past two seasons where he was constantly smoking like a chimney. As for the second half with the exception of ""The Savage,"" I believe that the season went downhill right after Zito's death. In my other review of Season Two, I said that one of the main characters needed to die, but I was one year too late. I actually predicted Zito's death early on Season Three based on how much I was seeing of John Diehl in the first eleven episodes compared to Michael Talbott whose character who seems to have become, all of a sudden, the ""tech whiz"" with significantly more on-screen time. Whenever Switek surveils somebody, he reads the book of magic tricks without doing any practice and is not actually watching anyone. Also, in my review of Season Two, I mentioned that the episodes have pacing problems, become too routine and formulaic, and featured scenes that are viewed as time fillers. The chief problems have emerged again in the second half of Season Three. Evidently, it looks like that writers have run out of ideas again. Remember the dramatic final episode ""Sons and Lovers"" in Season Two? Well, the half-brother comes back with vengeance for Tubbs in ""The Afternoon Plane,"" and the episode turns out to be a big disappointment. I was really expecting more. Hey, what happened to Alicia Austin? We never heard from her again. On the other hand, the final episode is blah and lacks any punch. Once again, Gina Callabrese abuses the police powers of hers and murders somebody for the second time because he just happened to kill her mother. I was thinking, ""What if that was a hoax story...an elaborate lie?"" Gone to the window is Sonny's code of ethics. The first two seasons show him being the nice all-around guy who cares for proper police work and procedures. But in Season Three, he uses people without regard, put their lives in harm's way which have eventually led to deaths, and advocates police brutality to get answers. This overall aspect in Sonny has probably reached the zenith point when the black star football player died doing something insignificant, and then it is followed up with ""Down for the Count"" which resulted in Zito's death. His and along with Moon's deaths were unnecessary because Sonny just decided out of the blue to get this bad guy (Pepe Serna) with no probable cause. Furthermore, Sonny's weird taste in women still continues as he was about to get married with a heroin junkie. Notice that in the back of the DVD cover for Miami Vice: Season Three, it mentions the names of Viggo Mortensen and Benicio Del Toro. Well, the former was only in an episode for mere one minute, and the latter was a nobody. Why not mention Melanie Griffith, Laurence Fishburne, Wesley Snipes, and Willie Nelson instead? Come on, it's an 80's show, and they were 80's people. I thought Ira Stone (Bob Balaban of Seinfeld) was shot point-blank in the chest in the prior season and was supposed to be dead...? Speaking of repeat cameos, I am getting really tired of seeing the same ones playing different characters throughout the series. All in all, I think that Miami Vice: Season Three is signaling the end of the series as we know it and will get worse henceforth with occasional flashes of brilliance. By the way, was the episode ""Shadow in the Dark"" really a spoof of Michael Mann's movie Manhunter?",4,A Tale of Two Halves.,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",2013,4331,"['Viewed', '6/13Rate', '4/56/13', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Season', 'Three', 'tale', 'two', 'halves', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'had', 'greatest', 'opening', 'credits', 'ever', 'got', 'reedited', 'third', 'season', 'What', 'awful', 'change', 'first', 'half', 'recovery', 'edge', 'series', 'was', 'missing', 'Season', 'One', 'best', 'stuff', 'series', 'ever', 'done', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'having', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'responsible', 'Law', 'Order', 'television', 'show', 'board', 'everything', 'do', 'However', 'gone', 'are', 'pastel', 'colors', 'distinctive', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'style', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'started', 'Season', 'One', 'Season', 'Three', 'noticeably', 'darker', 'more', 'right', 'point', 'One', 'improvement', 'replacement', 'Ferrari', 'Daytona', 'Spyder', 'Testarossa', 'much', 'better', 'Blood', 'now', 'realistically', 'shown', 'people', 'are', 'shot', 'whereas', 'past', 'were', 'visible', 'wounds', 'bad', 'guys', 'kept', 'going', 'down', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'smoking', 'habits', 'Not', 'single', 'drag', 'was', 'taken', 'entire', 'season', 'compared', 'past', 'two', 'seasons', 'where', 'was', 'constantly', 'smoking', 'chimney', 'second', 'half', 'exception', 'Savage', 'believe', 'season', 'went', 'downhill', 'right', 'Zito', 'death', 'other', 'review', 'Season', 'Two', 'said', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'needed', 'die', 'was', 'one', 'year', 'too', 'late', 'actually', 'predicted', 'Zito', 'death', 'early', 'Season', 'Three', 'based', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'seeing', 'John', 'Diehl', 'first', 'eleven', 'episodes', 'compared', 'Michael', 'Talbott', 'character', 'who', 'have', 'become', 'sudden', 'tech', 'whiz', 'significantly', 'more', 'on-screen', 'time', 'Whenever', 'Switek', 'somebody', 'book', 'magic', 'tricks', 'doing', 'practice', 'not', 'actually', 'watching', 'anyone', 'Also', 'review', 'Season', 'Two', 'mentioned', 'episodes', 'have', 'pacing', 'problems', 'become', 'too', 'routine', 'formulaic', 'featured', 'scenes', 'are', 'viewed', 'time', 'fillers', 'chief', 'problems', 'have', 'emerged', 'again', 'second', 'half', 'Season', 'Three', 'Evidently', 'writers', 'have', 'run', 'ideas', 'again', 'Remember', 'dramatic', 'final', 'episode', 'Sons', 'Lovers', 'Season', 'Two', 'Well', 'half-brother', 'back', 'vengeance', 'Tubbs', 'Afternoon', 'Plane', 'episode', 'out', 'be', 'big', 'disappointment', 'was', 'really', 'expecting', 'more', 'Hey', 'what', 'happened', 'Alicia', 'Austin', 'never', 'heard', 'again', 'other', 'hand', 'final', 'episode', 'blah', 'punch', 'Once', 'again', 'Gina', 'Callabrese', 'police', 'powers', 'hers', 'murders', 'somebody', 'second', 'time', 'just', 'happened', 'kill', 'mother', 'was', 'thinking', 'What', 'was', 'hoax', 'story', 'elaborate', 'lie', 'Gone', 'window', 'Sonny', 'code', 'ethics', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'show', 'being', 'nice', 'all-around', 'guy', 'who', 'proper', 'police', 'work', 'procedures', 'Season', 'Three', 'people', 'regard', 'put', 'lives', 'harm', 'way', 'have', 'eventually', 'led', 'deaths', 'police', 'brutality', 'get', 'answers', 'overall', 'aspect', 'Sonny', 'probably', 'reached', 'zenith', 'point', 'when', 'black', 'star', 'football', 'player', 'died', 'doing', 'something', 'insignificant', 'then', 'followed', 'up', 'Down', 'Count', 'resulted', 'Zito', 'death', 'Moon', 'deaths', 'were', 'unnecessary', 'Sonny', 'just', 'decided', 'blue', 'get', 'bad', 'guy', 'Pepe', 'Serna', 'probable', 'cause', 'Furthermore', 'Sonny', 'weird', 'taste', 'women', 'still', 'was', 'about', 'get', 'married', 'heroin', 'junkie', 'Notice', 'back', 'DVD', 'cover', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Season', 'Three', 'names', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'Well', 'former', 'was', 'only', 'episode', 'mere', 'one', 'minute', 'latter', 'was', 'nobody', 'Why', 'not', 'mention', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Laurence', 'Fishburne', 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'instead', 'Come', '80', 'show', 'were', '80', 'people', 'thought', 'Ira', 'Stone', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'Seinfeld', 'was', 'shot', 'point-blank', 'chest', 'prior', 'season', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'dead', 'Speaking', 'repeat', 'cameos', 'am', 'getting', 'really', 'tired', 'seeing', 'same', 'ones', 'playing', 'different', 'characters', 'series', 'think', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'Season', 'Three', 'signaling', 'end', 'series', 'know', 'will', 'get', 'worse', 'henceforth', 'occasional', 'flashes', 'brilliance', 'way', 'was', 'episode', 'Shadow', 'Dark', 'really', 'spoof', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'movie', 'Manhunter']",Miami Vice: Season Three

The positives are that they got rid of the stupid Universal logo at the beginning of every episode on the previous boxsets.  The music in 5.1 Surround is excellent.  I have a home theatre system that I play it in, and it's great!.  Universal finally wised up and got rid of the double-sided easily scratchable discs.

1046904,AYWQWJTHFSOKG,B000MLWQ6S,bobbyrice,"[1, 1]","I am a huge Miami Vice fan and will readily admit that the best seasons for this show were most definitely the first two. I was a little apprehensive about getting the third season on disc but the price was right so I went for it. Most episodes aren't bad. There are SO many guest stars that would later become much more famous. There was an episode with Viggo Mortenson (who would later be a lead in &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34;) in a very small part of a show opener for example. Seriously, it's fun watching all the stars and figuring out how many years later til they got famous. I think the reason I hesitated was, among other things, that this was the end of the Daytona. I think that episode may have been the turning point in the series for me. The white Testarossa just never did it for me.

1046911,A2TJGOCPAI2AHA,B000MLWQ6S,Isaac Fischer,"[61, 69]","ok, they are taking forever with these sets.  anyway, its finally here.  i think season two was the best season overall, but season three had some of the best episodes;  unfortunately, it had some pretty bad ones as well.  here's the quick and dirty on each episode:When irish eyes are crying:  the season premier episode.  i was a little let down after the spectacular season premier of season 2 (the prodigal son).  this is a very good episode though with liam neeson as the IRA terrorist.  also, an important episode because crockett gets his ferrari blown up (its a classic mv moment; the expression on crocket's face lol)stone's war:  the stone eps are always good.  crocket's reporter friend from viet nam returns to try and take down g. gordon liddy (yea, good luck with that pal!)kill shot:  a ho-hum episode about an impotent jai alai player who gets black mailed by drug dealers.  nothing to write home about...walk alone:  ok, one of the best episodes of mv, imho.  tubbs has to go undercover in a prison to get the guys that killed his girlfriend in a club.  larry fishburne plays a guard.  great music in this one and one of the more brutal eps of mv...the good collar: a ho hum episode again.  crockett identifies with a star football player that gets caught up in the drug world. nuthin' special...shadow in the dark: ok, again one of my fav. eps.  dark, moody, dreamlike and strange.  a cat burgler goes after people's pants and ear-rings and freaks crockett and a detective out as they both try to develop the mindset of the cat burgler to catch him.  GREAT scene with castillo and crockett sitting in a coffee shop together :)el viejo: i really like this episode featuring willie nielson. has bon jovi song, wanted, dead or alive and flies on the windscreen by depache mode. also features the little reservior dogs geek, steve buscimi.  great music, action and plot...better living through chemistry: i really like this ep too in which tubbs' old partner comes back from NY for a little revenge on tubbs. a genius chemist figures out how to synthesize cocaine.  hummm, all they need is a guina pig now. hey, is that izzie??baby blues:  ok, this ep [...].  something about a black market for babies and a dirty lawyer.  i only watched it maybe twice, when i've watched the other eps many, many times...streetwise: another [...] ep featuring the clown that can't act from tombstone (bill paxton).  about an undercover cop who is in love with a hooker. this can't end well...down for the count: sad, dreery 2 part ep. in which zito is killed.  didn't really care for these eps and didn't like to see zito go :(the savage: i like this episode about an assassin and his handler that have been brought in to take out a communist sympathizer.  crockett and castillo find some help from an old viet nam friend who was trying to track down the assassin in nam.  Michael wright is great as the assassin who has a nasty habit of killing hookers along with his ""legit"" i.e., ""sanctioned"" targets.  good music and ending...theresa: crockett's dr. girlfriend (helena bonham carter) is also a junkie.  too bad for you crockett! she compromises his case and i.a. goes after crockett, thinking he's dirty.  he has to prove himself by taking down brad dourif! a good epan afternoon plane: ok, really good ep. in which calderon's son, john leguizmo, comes back to get a little revenge by tricking tubbs and his new lady (also a dr.) to stay on an island that has no guns on it.  good music and good acting in an ep in which tubbs takes on 3 stone killers. but why did tubbs' girl think she could help with that??lend me an ear:  great ep.  has the song, lend me an ear by the waterboys.  crockett and tubbs try to put surveillance on a money launderer and enlist the help of a free-lance bug-guy, who, unfortunately, plays both sides of the fence...by hooker or by crook:  interesting ep. featuring melanie griffith and george takie. melanie is a heidi fliess type madame and crockett uses her to go after sulu.  she comes to his boat to tell him what a [...] he is. a decent ep...viking bikers from hell: ahh, one of my all time fav eps featuring a lot of great new mv music.  crockett and tubbs track down, with the help of izzie, the leader of a motorcycle gang who is seeking revenge against the person who took out his friend.  he uses the, um, process of elimination to make sure he gets his man.  tubbs gets shot in this ep...everybody's in showbiz:  i kinda liked this ep. about a guy sonny put in the clink but who happens to be an artist (writes plays and acts in them).  the guy steals a briefcase from a crack dealer and apparently, the crack dealer's entire business is in the briefcase.  needless to say, he's not amused.  kind of a funny ending as crockett and tubbs get duped...heroes in the revolution: WTF?!?! where did this s#$) come from?  something about gina's mom and a revolution. one of the worst mvs in my opinion...ok, i left out a couple eps, so sue me.  maybe someone could fill in the gaps.  anyway, now that i look back on that season, i realize it had a few of my favorite all time eps.  the bad episodes bring the season down a little though.  hope this guide was helpful to you pal!",5,"geeez, finally.  here's the

While Season 2 began the shift toward more serious storylines, Season 3 coupled the dark storylines with a darker tone.  The bright colors, and general sense of style was toned down in favor of more real stories.  This tactic worked in making the show better, in that you concentrated on the stories more than what they were wearing, or what music was playing.  In this, it really was the best season of Miami Vice yet.  The stories used some clever then current events, the IRA conflict, fake adoptions based on kidnaped children, and the corrupt prison system.  There was also a lot of episodes that worked on establishing the Miami Vice world, including the change in automobiles, the death of a major (and some would say favorite) character, as well as another episode in the Calderone Saga (an episode that seems very much a tribute to high noon).I've reviewed other seasons and noted that I never watched this show while it was on TV, as it was far before my time.  But I must say the show holds up surprisingly well, and I hope the improvements from season to season carry on.  Either way, this season is a classic, and full of entertaining episodes.

1046924,A363QRXP83K8ZE,B000MLWQ6S,"N. P. Stathoulopoulos ""nick9155""","[2, 2]","The third season of Miami Vice appeared during the fall of 1986 in a new time slot, which apparently caused a dip in the ratings due to direct competition with Dallas.  However, the show had gained a head of steam by that point.The show seems to take a darker turn in this season, in the style and subject matter departments.  Many endings add a cynical twist as the duo deal with contemporary events like US activity in Nicaragua, the burgeoning fascination with criminal psychology, the rise of synthetic street drugs, and even terrorism.  Corruption abounds as they enter a prison to expose and shut down a criminal operation run by the warden himself, or watch one of their own break down from blackmail.  The vice squad even loses a member in a memorable two-parter.  There are a lot of gun battles, too, with Crockett blowing away a slew of bad guys with his trusty pistol, which always sounded like the Dirty Harry gun.  How many times did he have to go in front of the 'shooting board'?  It should be every single episode---these guys are involved in more shootings than entire metro departments.As others have noted, the look of the show changed, too, from the pastels of 1984 to darker hues to match the subject matter.  And the haircuts have changed with Crockett sporting a very '86 spiky 'do.  And yes, the 'fake' Ferrari Daytona Spyder is blown to smithereens in the great season opener (by an ultra-sleazy gun dealer played by Jeff Fahey) and replaced by the white Testarossa.And the guest appearances...has any other show had so many then-famous and soon-to-be-famous people appear?  Doubtful.  Among the familiar faces this time around are Liam Neeson, Lou Diamond Philips, Viggo Mortensen, Benecio Del Toro, John Glover, Sonny Landham (round about the time he appeared as Billy in Predator ), Lawrence Fishburne, the late John Matuszak of Raiders fame, Annette Benning, Vincent D'Onofrio, Wesley Snipes, Bill Paxton, G. Gordon Liddy (again), Bob Balaban (also again), Ron Perlman, Charles S. Dutton, Willie Nelson, and the guy who played the principal in the Breakfast Club.  And...in one single episode you have Melanie Griffith, Vanity, Captain Lou Albano, and George Takei(!)Highly recommended.  This was a very good show that hit perhaps its best stride during the third season.  There are very few weak episodes, and some very classic ones.  Shadow In The Dark is like Manhunter-lite and appeared that same year by Michael Mann.  Stone's War dealt with current events of the day in Nicaragua.  Walk Alone featured Tubbs going overcover in prison, and getting bailed out by rear-whooping Castillo.  This really was 'TV Noir', with Hollywood-level production values on a TV show.  Though often remembered only for the style (white jackets, rolled up sleeves, Ray Bans), Miami Vice also gave us a lot of cop-show clich&eacute;s that writers still can't escape from.  As always, Jan Hammer's music is a perfect supplement, particularly when he does that ominous chord when something bad happens (Baaaaaaaarrrr---rrrourrrr...you get the point).  One of the reasons the show took so long to appear on DVD is because all of the rights clearing for the (many, many) songs used...they're all here and intact.",4,Neon Shadows in the Darker Season,1246320000,"06 30, 2009",2009,3222,"['third', 'season', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'appeared', 'fall', '1986', 'new', 'time', 'slot', 'apparently', 'caused', 'dip', 'ratings', 'due', 'direct', 'competition', 'Dallas', 'However', 'show', 'had', 'gained', 'head', 'steam', 'point.The', 'show', 'take', 'darker', 'turn', 'season', 'style', 'subject', 'matter', 'departments', 'Many', 'endings', 'add', 'cynical', 'twist', 'duo', 'deal', 'contemporary', 'events', 'US', 'activity', 'Nicaragua', 'burgeoning', 'fascination', 'criminal', 'psychology', 'rise', 'synthetic', 'street', 'drugs', 'even', 'terrorism', 'Corruption', 'enter', 'prison', 'expose', 'shut', 'down', 'criminal', 'operation', 'run', 'warden', 'watch', 'one', 'own', 'break', 'down', 'blackmail', 'vice', 'squad', 'even', 'member', 'memorable', 'two-parter', 'are', 'lot', 'gun', 'battles', 'too', 'Crockett', 'blowing', 'away', 'slew', 'bad', 'guys', 'trusty', 'pistol', 'always', 'sounded', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'gun', 'How', 'many', 'times', 'did', 'have', 'go', 'front', ""'shooting"", 'board', 'should', 'be', 'single', 'episode', '-these', 'guys', 'are', 'involved', 'more', 'shootings', 'entire', 'metro', 'departments.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'look', 'show', 'changed', 'too', 'pastels', '1984', 'darker', 'hues', 'match', 'subject', 'matter', 'haircuts', 'have', 'changed', 'Crockett', 'sporting', 'very', ""'86"", 'spiky', 'yes', ""'fake"", 'Ferrari', 'Daytona', 'Spyder', 'blown', 'smithereens', 'great', 'season', 'opener', 'ultra-sleazy', 'gun', 'dealer', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Fahey', 'replaced', 'white', 'Testarossa.And', 'guest', 'appearances', 'other', 'show', 'had', 'so', 'many', 'then-famous', 'soon-to-be-famous', 'people', 'appear', 'Doubtful', 'familiar', 'time', 'around', 'are', 'Liam', 'Neeson', 'Lou', 'Diamond', 'Philips', 'Viggo', 'Mortensen', 'Benecio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'John', 'Glover', 'Sonny', 'Landham', 'round', 'time', 'appeared', 'Billy', 'Predator', 'Lawrence', 'Fishburne', 'late', 'John', 'Matuszak', 'Raiders', 'fame', 'Annette', 'Benning', 'Vincent', ""D'Onofrio"", 'Wesley', 'Snipes', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'G.', 'Gordon', 'Liddy', 'again', 'Bob', 'Balaban', 'also', 'again', 'Ron', 'Perlman', 'Charles', 'S.', 'Dutton', 'Willie', 'Nelson', 'guy', 'who', 'played', 'principal', 'Breakfast', 'Club', 'one', 'single', 'episode', 'have', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'Vanity', 'Captain', 'Lou', 'Albano', 'George', 'Takei', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'show', 'hit', 'perhaps', 'best', 'stride', 'third', 'season', 'are', 'very', 'few', 'weak', 'episodes', 'very', 'classic', 'ones', 'Shadow', 'Dark', 'Manhunter-lite', 'appeared', 'same', 'year', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'Stone', 'War', 'dealt', 'current', 'events', 'day', 'Nicaragua', 'Walk', 'Alone', 'featured', 'Tubbs', 'going', 'overcover', 'prison', 'getting', 'bailed', 'out', 'rear-whooping', 'Castillo', 'really', 'was', ""'TV"", 'Noir', 'Hollywood-level', 'production', 'values', 'TV', 'show', 'Though', 'often', 'remembered', 'only', 'style', 'white', 'jackets', 'rolled', 'up', 'sleeves', 'Ray', 'Bans', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'also', 'gave', 'lot', 'cop-show', 'clich', 'eacute', 'writers', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escape', 'always', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'music', 'perfect', 'supplement', 'particularly', 'when', 'ominous', 'chord', 'when', 'something', 'bad', 'happens', 'Baaaaaaaarrrr', '-rrrourrrr', 'get', 'point', 'One', 'reasons', 'show', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'appear', 'DVD', 'rights', 'clearing', 'many', 'many', 'songs', 'used', ""'re"", 'here', 'intact']",Miami Vice: Season Three
1046925,A3C2HQOFO37TFN,B000MLWQ6S,Pamela Walters,"[3, 4]","This season was a sort of transition phase of the show, they ditched the whole STYLE aspect of the show, or were trying something new. Michael Mann was on his way out, and they brought in Law And Order mogul Dick Wolf. I think his approach to Vice added to the show, but also took away from it at the same time. Gone were the days of pastel colours, and fun episodes, and in it's place were more serious episodes, and no recurring storylines.They ended season 2 with the episode Sons And Lovers, which focused around Calderone's daughter Angelina, who Tubbs had a relationship with, she has Tubbs' baby, and her brother vows revenge on Tubbs, and supposedly the baby and Angelina get killed in the crossfire. It was a bit of a cliffhanger in my eyes, but the season premiere of season 3 has no mention of any previous characters or storylines. They do end up tying up the loose end with Calderone's son in an episode called The Afternoon Plane which was somewhat of a dissapointment.They get rid of the beautiful Black Ferrari Daytona Spyder in episode 2, which in this set is episode 1 (Episode 1 is really El Viejo) and they replace it with a Ferrari Testarossa. I find that the season starts off really boring, but once ya get to about the 3rd episode if you start with El Viejo as the season opener, then it starts to get good.This season, since it is a bit of a transition period is really hit and miss. They have a good 4-5 episodes, then a few bad ones, then a few good ones, and so on. I find season 4 is a lot more consistent, but Season 3 has some really good episodes. 2 episodes that immediately come to mind are the intense WALK ALONE, where Tubbs goes undercover in a prison, and my personal favourite episode would have to be SHADOW IN THE DARK, which features an eery score from Jan Hammer, and is about a night stalker that breaks into peoples houses. The whole episode is eery, which was fitting that it was originally aired on Halloween.Another great episode was the 2 parter Down For The Count. I won't spoil this episode, but it has to be seen. It's a great episode. I find the season premiere and season finale in this season really are boring.Another thing I found weird about this season is the picture at times is really overly bright, or blurry because of some cheesy effect that they used at the time to make it look dreamy, from what I heard.

night show on NBC & to when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade back then.MIAMI VICE's 3rd Season also takes me back to memory lane to when NBC's motto was ""Come Home To NBC"", which was NBC's credo from the Fall of 1986 thru the Summer of 1987.This was also the first full season with Crockett's snazzy white Ferrari Testerosa too which was more upgraded than Crockett's black Ferrari used in the first 2 Seasons of MIAMI VICE.It was also interesting seeing guest stars like*Willie Nelson in the ""El Viejo"" episode*Wesley Snipes in the ""Street Wise"" episode before he became a star*Boxing promoter Don King doing a cameo appearance in the ""Down For The Count"" episode*George Takei in the ""By Hooker, By Crook"" episode after his co-starring days on STAR TREK*Ismael ""East"" Carlo in the ""Cuba Libre"" episode during his co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA & DAYS OF OUR LIVES*Lou Diamond Phillips & Melanie Griffith in the ""Red Tape"" episode*Wrestler Lou Albano in the ""By Hooker By Crook"" episode*Former football celebrity John Matuszak in the ""Viking Bikers From Hell""*Laurence Fishburne in the ""Walk Alone"" episode before he became a star*Don Johnson's ex-wife(Melanie Griffith)in the ""By Hooker By Crook"" episodeIt was also neat being able to watch these episodes complete & uncut as well as commercial-free as opposed to how they were shown in reruns on USA, FX, TNN, and TV Land which edited each episode by deleting too many scenes to allot more time for too many commercial disruptions.It's just too bad Universal decided not to provide the original air-dates

1046936,A3D6KZT0QG6UKB,B000MLWQ6S,"Tim Lieder ""Founder of Dybbuk Press""","[2, 2]","In the first two seasons, Miami Vice was the style over substance show that critics loved to cite as the quintessential 80s excess. It was cheesy and colorful. No one could get arrested without making it into a major shoot out. If you made a drinking game out of how many times Don Johnson shouted ""NO!"" and then ran to save someone that couldn't be saved you would fall into a coma. Exactly how Crockett and Tubbs could operate undercover for as long as they did made no sense, and it didn't have to make sense.The problem with the third season is that Dick Wolf's contribution called for more serious stories that had a sense of realism. If one considers these seasons a rehearsal for his Law & Order series, there's some value to them. However, the attempt at making Miami Vice serious ruined the show.There were two problems with this endeavor. First, there is a cheesy element to the early Miami Vice episodes that people loved. Without Sonny's pet crocodile or the pastel palettes, the fun goes out of the show. Secondly, it is impossible to bring Miami Vice to the kind of gravitas that you are going to see in shows like Law & Order or The Wire. The writers are not going to start talking about procedure or building a case or anything like that. It's still going to be Crockett and Tubbs enjoying the good life as fake gangsters and roughing up criminals and getting into a million gun fights. Criminals are still killed at birthday parties with their faces falling into birthday cakes. Pretty much every time a character is introduced for Crockett or Tubbs to care about, that character is dead by the end of the show.In essence, the show eliminated enough of its cheesy elements to lose the element of fun but not enough to be a compelling police drama. So the show becomes a slog.Later on, Michael Mann would make a serious version of Miami Vice in movie form but that was long after the show was off the air and didn't have to please anyone with show mythology.That's not to say that this set is completely worthless. It is fun watching Helena Bonham Carter playing a drug addicted doctor or Ian McShane playing a ""Colombian"" gangster (his accent is still that British accent that only Ian McShane has). But there are too few entertaining moments to justify the dreary show that emerged in the absence of pastel.",3,This is where the show stops being fun...,1351468800,"10 29, 2012",2012,2325,"['first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'was', 'style', 'substance', 'show', 'critics', 'loved', 'cite', 'quintessential', '80s', 'excess', 'was', 'cheesy', 'colorful', 'one', 'could', 'get', 'arrested', 'making', 'major', 'shoot', 'out', 'made', 'drinking', 'game', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'shouted', 'NO', 'then', 'ran', 'save', 'someone', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'saved', 'would', 'fall', 'coma', 'Exactly', 'how', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'could', 'operate', 'undercover', 'as', 'long', 'did', 'made', 'sense', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'make', 'sense.The', 'problem', 'third', 'season', 'Dick', 'Wolf', 'contribution', 'called', 'more', 'serious', 'stories', 'had', 'sense', 'realism', 'one', 'seasons', 'rehearsal', 'Law', 'Order', 'series', 'value', 'However', 'attempt', 'making', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'serious', 'ruined', 'show.There', 'were', 'two', 'problems', 'endeavor', 'First', 'cheesy', 'element', 'early', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'people', 'loved', 'Sonny', 'pet', 'crocodile', 'pastel', 'fun', 'show', 'Secondly', 'impossible', 'bring', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'kind', 'gravitas', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'shows', 'Law', 'Order', 'Wire', 'writers', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'start', 'talking', 'procedure', 'building', 'case', 'anything', 'still', 'going', 'be', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'enjoying', 'good', 'life', 'fake', 'gangsters', 'roughing', 'up', 'criminals', 'getting', 'million', 'gun', 'fights', 'Criminals', 'are', 'still', 'killed', 'birthday', 'parties', 'falling', 'birthday', 'cakes', 'Pretty', 'much', 'time', 'character', 'introduced', 'Crockett', 'Tubbs', 'care', 'about', 'character', 'dead', 'end', 'show.In', 'essence', 'show', 'eliminated', 'enough', 'cheesy', 'elements', 'lose', 'element', 'fun', 'not', 'enough', 'be', 'compelling', 'police', 'drama', 'show', 'slog.Later', 'Michael', 'Mann', 'would', 'make', 'serious', 'version', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'movie', 'form', 'was', 'long', 'show', 'was', 'air', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'please', 'anyone', 'show', 'mythology.That', 'not', 'say', 'set', 'completely', 'worthless', 'fun', 'watching', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'playing', 'drug', 'addicted', 'doctor', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'playing', 'Colombian', 'gangster', 'accent', 'still', 'British', 'accent', 'only', 'Ian', 'McShane', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'entertaining', 'moments', 'justify', 'dreary', 'show', 'emerged', 'absence', 'pastel']",Miami Vice: Season Three
