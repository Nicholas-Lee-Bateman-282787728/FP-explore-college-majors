This movie had absolutley NO plot, and the acting was not so great (and why did Nicole Kidman win Best Actress??? The mystery lives on...) This movie is about a bunch of lesbians (yes, everybody in this movie is a lesbian or a gay) who want to kill themselves or are thinking deeply about it! This movie was very boring, and very hard to follow whatever Virginia Wolfe was rambling on about in famous quotes, such as ""...death... is... possible...""(yeah, no s**t lady) The entire time my family and I were watching this movie, the only thing we could think about was ""WHEN IS SHE GOING TO KILL HERSELF ALREADY???"" This movie is about three ill-fated, weak, suicidal woman who cry over everything!!! There is no development in characters, and it just all seems like a waste of time and THANK GOD we rented this movie for free!!! PLEASE D NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! I RECCOMEND IT TO NOBODY!!!

590894,A1X3HW20S9TK9P,B00005JKTI,Aaron Edson,"[0, 0]","Watching The Hours is like listening to a symphony.  It has beautiful orchestraded moments that arise and fall like a timeless musical score.  The subject matter of this movie is hard to debate at first.  There are a lot of themes and subplots, but The Hours is mainly about three different women in three different time peroids, living their lives for everyone else but themselves, all connected by Virgina Wolf's book Mrs. Dalloway.The three main performances are each sensational.  Everyone already knows, from one was or another, that Nicole Kidman is excellent and won an Oscar for her role.  I would really like to compliment Meryl Streep.  Even though her role was not as &quot;showy&quot; as Kidman's, Streep delivers probably the best acting in the film.  She delievers all of her lines perfectly, and is always on the edge as her character is.  I can't give enough praise to her.  And lastly, Ms. Moore blends into her character quite nicely.  She makes this 50s housewife distinctly different from her character in Far From Heaven, which makes her performance all the more incredible.Also, there has to be room to say how good Philip Glass's score is.  Some people critize it harshly saying it interupts watching the movie because of the constant beats tapping away.  However, I strongly feel is adds perfectly to the viewing.  The music fits like a glove.  Truly, The Hours would not have been the same for me without Glass's score.Overall, The Hours is an elegant film about some of drama's darkest themes.  But, the way The Hours is created, these heavy themes float on water like music on air.

This alone deserves the 3 stars I've given it.The story moves between 3 shorter stories: the story of Virginia Woolf, set in the 20's while writing 'Mrs. Daloway', a story of a housewife set in the late 40's / early 50'd era reading 'Mrs Daloway', and the story of a modern day 'Mrs. Daloway', set in 1999.The story moves very slowly between all three threads, interconnecting them throughout it. The depth is supposedly given by the interlocking emotional issues between the 3 stories (hence the 'chick flick' reference). But I felt that the movie focused too much on this emotional connection between the women, and neglected to make me care about them as characters, or their relationship.",3,Too 'Chick Flick' - At least for me...,1055894400,"06 18, 2003",2003,814,"['Let', 'start', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'acting', 'spectacular', 'can', 'expect', 'cast', 'alone', '3', 'stars', ""'ve"", 'given', 'it.The', 'story', 'moves', '3', 'shorter', 'stories', 'story', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'set', '20', 'writing', ""'Mrs"", 'Daloway', 'story', 'housewife', 'set', 'late', '40', '/', 'early', '50', ""'d"", 'era', 'reading', 'Daloway', 'story', 'modern', 'day', 'Daloway', 'set', '1999.The', 'story', 'moves', 'very', 'slowly', 'three', 'threads', 'interconnecting', 'depth', 'supposedly', 'given', 'interlocking', 'emotional', 'issues', '3', 'stories', 'hence', ""'chick"", 'flick', 'reference', 'felt', 'movie', 'focused', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'connection', 'women', 'neglected', 'make', 'care', 'about', 'characters', 'relationship']",The Hours

Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep also star. Moore has never been better! She nails every scene she is in, although I was very disappointed with Streep's performance, very over the top and wooden. Kidman earned an Oscar for her fragile performance of the suicidal writer. I love the scene when she tells her husband she feels suffocated and wants to go back home so she can write. Toni Collette has a small part as the neighbor of Moore, too bad her scene was so brief 'cause her scene made the biggest impact.

590898,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,B00005JKTI,"Amaranth ""music fan""","[4, 4]","""The Hours"" is a quiet, meditative piece about what makes life worth living. It unites the stories of three women- Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), struggling with suicidal thoughts, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), expecting a child and struggling with her desires, and Clarissa (Meryl Streep), who's watching her ex-husband die from AIDS. The trio of women share a self-destructive streak. Ironically, and powerfully, the movie is about living life.Virginia dotes on her husband, Leonard, yet she feels passionately for other women. She authored ""Orlando"" in honor of her onetime lover Vita Sackville-West. She is writing ""Mrs. Dalloway."" In the '50s, Laura is expecting a child with her boring but gentle husband (a brilliant, understated John C. Reilly) However, it is her bosomy neighbor (Toni Collette) who awakens her conflicted desires. Laura considers suicide. Realizing the unborn life within her, and reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"", she chooses life.  In 2001, Clarissa is caring for her ex-husband, who's suffering from AIDS (Ed Harris) She cannot understand his profound pain. Though he has a boyfriend (Jeff Daniels,in a surprisingly good turn) and she has a girlfriend (Alison Janney),they still have a spousal bond. He calls her ""Mrs. Dalloway."" The underlying mystery is--what links the three women?""The Hours"" seems to glorify suicide, from Kidman drowning herself to Harris hurtling himself off a window ledge. However, it is Laura's choice for life that gives the story's three threads their essential link. Life makes connectedness possible. The hypnotic music from Philip Glass is excellent.

I have waited a long time to bother writing a review, because I know that my opinion is not popular.  The actressing is a big deal among my cinephile friends, and yet I'm put off by the bulk of it here.  Quite frankly, this is a result of too much being heaped upon too much without the right balance.  One reviewer stated that this should have been titled `The Insane, the Unhappy and the Confused'.  I agree with this.  I have defended Daldry's directorial aesthetic in the past, considering that I feel `Billy Elliot' a towering debut and `The Reader' to be a misunderstood masterpiece, but I cannot defend this since he does almost everything wrong here.  He can't build his tone in a way that complements the film's frames.  Instead, he meshes together a group of stories that interweave in a way that bleeds a melodramatic atmosphere with almost no point.  It doesn't feel inspired or poignant or engaged.It merely feels sad.The acting is stuck in the film's mood, which isn't a compliment this time.  Harris is horrific, Moore is bland, Streep is uneven and Kidman is trying way too hard (although she does fare better than the bulk of the cast).  The rest of the supporting cast is just there, although I will admit that Toni Collette and John C. Reilly make more of an impact than that the film's nominated stars.I like depressing, and I like challenging and I love a film that digs at the darkness in our souls, but this film is just too drab for its own good.

Virginia is introduced as a mentally unstable author under a doctor's care, and the woman in her latest book is living vicariously through Laura Brown, who picks up the book in '51 and is seen reading it throughout the movie.After twenty or so minutes into the movie, I figured the three stories going on would intertwine somewhere along the line (despite it being different years), but I still couldn't quite understand how Clarissa's life connected to the other characters' - that is, until near the end of the movie.

590904,A2EL3990HXOMZB,B00005JKTI,Antonio Robert,"[1, 1]","Great acting, music and storyline shifting smoothly within three settings are what makes this unusual film stand out. Three superb actresses shine in leading roles of three tortured women; Nicole Kidman, as author Virginia Woolf (between 1923-1941), hands in a difficult, wonderfully nuanced performance for which she got Oscar and Golden Globe (she said she found the role to be just for her after the divorce with Tom Cruise). Julianne Moore is once again at her most convincing as an unfulfilled 1950's housewife reading Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". And Meryl Streep plays a publisher preparing a party for her AIDS-stricken friend (a writer who calls her Mrs. Dalloway) in 2001.The viewer gradually discovers more are more things the three have in common, while their stories symbolically entertwine on the cushion wings of haunting music score by Philip Glass. The messages the characters are sending are rather ambiguous, with Kidman's character probably more likely to elicit compassion in spectators than Moore's and Streep's. Director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliott"") was able to get the best also from other actors, including Toni Collette, John C. Reilly, Jeff Daniels and Claire Danes. Only Ed Harris tries a bit too much as Streep character's friend, his acting here being far from low-key.Nevertheless, Harris was also nominated for an Oscar, as was Moore, and the leading female trio was given a joint prize for best actress at 2003 Berlin Film Festival.Offering a post-modern view on human relationships in an enthralling, mesmerising production, ""The Hours"" is not a film for everyone, but lovers of good cinema (and acting with capital A) definitely should not miss it.",4,Decisive Hours in the Lives of Three Women,1066435200,"10 18, 2003",2003,1689,"['Great', 'acting', 'music', 'storyline', 'shifting', 'smoothly', 'three', 'settings', 'are', 'what', 'unusual', 'film', 'stand', 'out', 'Three', 'superb', 'actresses', 'shine', 'leading', 'roles', 'three', 'tortured', 'women', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'author', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', '1923-1941', 'difficult', 'wonderfully', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'got', 'Oscar', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'said', 'found', 'role', 'be', 'just', 'divorce', 'Tom', 'Cruise', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'once', 'again', 'most', 'convincing', 'unfulfilled', '1950', 'housewife', 'reading', 'Woolf', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'publisher', 'preparing', 'party', 'AIDS-stricken', 'friend', 'writer', 'who', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', '2001.The', 'viewer', 'gradually', 'more', 'are', 'more', 'things', 'three', 'have', 'common', 'stories', 'symbolically', 'entertwine', 'cushion', 'wings', 'haunting', 'music', 'score', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'messages', 'characters', 'are', 'sending', 'are', 'rather', 'ambiguous', 'Kidman', 'character', 'probably', 'more', 'likely', 'elicit', 'compassion', 'spectators', 'Moore', 'Streep', 'Director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Billy', 'Elliott', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'best', 'also', 'other', 'actors', 'including', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Only', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Streep', 'character', 'friend', 'acting', 'here', 'being', 'far', 'low-key.Nevertheless', 'Harris', 'was', 'also', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'was', 'Moore', 'leading', 'female', 'trio', 'was', 'given', 'joint', 'prize', 'best', 'actress', '2003', 'Berlin', 'Film', 'Festival.Offering', 'post-modern', 'view', 'human', 'relationships', 'enthralling', 'mesmerising', 'production', 'Hours', 'not', 'film', 'everyone', 'lovers', 'good', 'cinema', 'acting', 'capital', 'A', 'definitely', 'should', 'not', 'miss']",The Hours
590905,A2T564OH4XZSZX,B00005JKTI,Austin Brown,"[2, 3]","I approched ""The Hours"" with very high expectations, perhaps due to my reading the novel of the same name prior driving an hour to view the film. I must say without doubt, I was not disappointed!Nicole Kidman was, to say the least, captivating, as the troubled and wonderful, bi-polar, Virginia Woolf! It seems that Kidman has not only erased every trace of her physical beauty, replacing it with the unkept, frumpy, and simply grey Mrs. Woolf, but she has also replaced her entire persona with that of the brillant, yet shocking, Woolf. Her stature, her body language, and her voice, were not her own!The film begins in 1941, when Virginia Woolf put rocks in her coat pockets, and walked calmly out into a river, ending her own life. The film then backtracks to a day in her life years before, a day like any other when she rises to work on her books, Mrs Dalloway in this case, and then goes on to prepare tea party for her sister and her children. Later, Woolf runs away from home to the train station, her intention being, to escape to London. In these desperate moments, Nicole Kidman delivers a very heartfelt speech about her longing to return permently to London. ""I'm living in a town I have no wish to liuve in. I'm living a life, I have no wish to live!""Julianne Moore put in a fair battle for her character Laura Brown, but I believe the character was simply too complex for her, or anyone, to adequatly convay to an audiance. But this is not purely at falt to the actress. Many of the events which occur in the day we observe in Mrs. Brown's life occur in the mental realm, rather than the physical realm, and cannot be protrayed on film in the same manner that the book can protray it. In the day we see of her life, she wakes to begin reading Woolf's Mrs Dalloway. (A very well written book I might add) Mrs. Brown then goes on to create a cake for her husband's birthday party, which does not come out to her satisfaction, so she tosses it. She then decides that she must escape for a while, and leaving her son with a sitter, she goes to a hotel, her intention being to end her life then and there, takeing a collection of medications she has brought with her, much of this is left unexpained, and could, I suppose leave the audience to wonder her purpose in visiting the hotel. Although, after a rest, she decides to live, and returns to pick up her son, and to bake another cake for her husband.Meryl Streep plays the third woman Clarissa Vaghen, a New Yorker who is the modern personification of Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, as well as being nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her best friend Richard. Streep's character is perhaps the one the audience will most readally understand, being her expressions are the most outward of the group, as well as being in a setting most familiar to the viewers. Ms. Vaghen's day encompasses her preparing a party for her friend Richard, being he has won a poetry award. I will not give away the revealing details of the story, which tie the lives together, but is safe to say, on this ordinary day, this day of all days, Clarissa's day, her party, and her life are radically changed.This movie is exceedingly gripping, and entertaining, if you let it be. I recommend you read the Pulizer Prize winning novel of the same name before you view the film, as it will not only give you a deeping understanding of the story, but also of the characters themselves explaining how the characters feel about many of the situations they face!If you love deeply involved and complex films, this one will not disappont!",5,A life I have no wish to live....,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,3552,"['approched', 'Hours', 'very', 'high', 'expectations', 'perhaps', 'due', 'reading', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'prior', 'driving', 'hour', 'view', 'film', 'must', 'say', 'doubt', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'was', 'say', 'least', 'captivating', 'troubled', 'wonderful', 'bi-polar', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Kidman', 'not', 'only', 'erased', 'trace', 'physical', 'beauty', 'replacing', 'unkept', 'frumpy', 'simply', 'grey', 'Mrs.', 'Woolf', 'also', 'replaced', 'entire', 'persona', 'brillant', 'yet', 'shocking', 'Woolf', 'stature', 'body', 'language', 'voice', 'were', 'not', 'own', 'film', '1941', 'when', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'put', 'rocks', 'coat', 'pockets', 'walked', 'calmly', 'out', 'river', 'ending', 'own', 'life', 'film', 'then', 'day', 'life', 'years', 'day', 'other', 'when', 'work', 'books', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'case', 'then', 'prepare', 'tea', 'party', 'sister', 'children', 'Later', 'Woolf', 'away', 'home', 'train', 'station', 'intention', 'being', 'escape', 'London', 'desperate', 'moments', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'speech', 'longing', 'return', 'permently', 'London', ""'m"", 'living', 'town', 'have', 'wish', 'liuve', ""'m"", 'living', 'life', 'have', 'wish', 'live', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'put', 'fair', 'battle', 'character', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'believe', 'character', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'complex', 'anyone', 'adequatly', 'convay', 'audiance', 'not', 'purely', 'falt', 'actress', 'Many', 'events', 'occur', 'day', 'observe', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'life', 'occur', 'mental', 'realm', 'rather', 'physical', 'realm', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'protrayed', 'film', 'same', 'manner', 'book', 'can', 'protray', 'day', 'see', 'life', 'begin', 'reading', 'Woolf', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'book', 'might', 'add', 'Mrs.', 'Brown', 'then', 'create', 'cake', 'husband', 'birthday', 'party', 'not', 'come', 'out', 'satisfaction', 'then', 'must', 'escape', 'while', 'leaving', 'son', 'sitter', 'hotel', 'intention', 'being', 'end', 'life', 'then', 'there', 'takeing', 'collection', 'medications', 'brought', 'much', 'left', 'unexpained', 'could', 'suppose', 'leave', 'audience', 'wonder', 'purpose', 'visiting', 'hotel', 'rest', 'live', 'returns', 'pick', 'up', 'son', 'bake', 'cake', 'husband.Meryl', 'Streep', 'third', 'woman', 'Clarissa', 'Vaghen', 'New', 'Yorker', 'who', 'modern', 'personification', 'Woolf', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'nicknamed', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'best', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Streep', 'character', 'perhaps', 'one', 'audience', 'will', 'most', 'readally', 'understand', 'being', 'expressions', 'are', 'most', 'outward', 'group', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'setting', 'most', 'familiar', 'viewers', 'Ms.', 'Vaghen', 'day', 'preparing', 'party', 'friend', 'Richard', 'being', 'won', 'poetry', 'award', 'will', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'revealing', 'details', 'story', 'lives', 'together', 'safe', 'say', 'ordinary', 'day', 'day', 'days', 'Clarissa', 'day', 'party', 'life', 'are', 'radically', 'changed.This', 'movie', 'exceedingly', 'gripping', 'entertaining', 'let', 'be', 'recommend', 'read', 'Pulizer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'view', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'only', 'give', 'deeping', 'understanding', 'story', 'also', 'characters', 'explaining', 'how', 'characters', 'feel', 'many', 'situations', 'face', 'love', 'deeply', 'involved', 'complex', 'films', 'one', 'will', 'not', 'disappont']",The Hours

THE HOURS is a film which probably holds more appeal for female viewers, but guys won't find it totally insufferable either though it does seem a bit overlong. THE HOURS is the only Nicole Kidman movie to date where male viewers won't be drooling over her, but they won't suffer a coronary if their girlfriends insist they watch it. Interestingly, the movie was disqualified for the makeup Oscar because Nicole's schnozz was digitally enhanced to make it appear seamless onscreen. So basically how much you enjoy this movie depends on whether you are a fan of Woolf (I'll admit I've never read her stuff) &amp; your gender. In my opinion the movie is good, but seriously overhyped.

As always, these actresses are wonderful (I much preferred Moore in this to her very similar part in &#65533;Far from Heaven;&#65533; and Meryl Streep is always a wonder).  Edward Harris as Streep&#65533;s dying friend is also remarkable.When I read the book on which this movie is based, I saw it as being as much like a piece of music as like a &#65533;traditional&#65533; novel:  themes rising, submerging, and reappearing just as in music (purchasing flowers; a kiss shared between two women; a life-threatening illness, etc.).  The movie seems to build on this musical analogy, the camera sometimes cutting directly from one story to an identical moment in the next.  The pervasive Philip Glass score adds to this sense of theme, variation, repetition.

One doesn't always need or want a happy movie, but when it comes to serious movies of this genre I really do believe that you have to be in the right mood.The first time I saw it I was so depressed after watching it.  Then the second time I was ready to watch it and to see it with all my senses.Being the avid book reader than I am, it even peaked my curiosity about Virginia Woolfs book  Mrs. Dalloway which I have since bought.  I was so in awe of Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf and the more indepth experience one gets from seeing Kidman as Woolfe and the mental health challenges she lived with.Clarissa Vaughn played by Meryl Streep is in my opinion one of Ms Streeps finest roles. She is one of the finest the world has ever seen when it comes to diversity and an ablility to make you feel as if you are a fly on the wall wherever she is.  Call me sappy but I really do watch ALL what is in a movie. Like someone who sits and people watches, I look at the stove in the kitchen and do a double take to see if those are Le Cresuset cookware on the shelf or is that a KtchenAid mixer in red I see?

Is that flour sifter like the one my Mom had?  Wow look at that sofa like Aunt Margaret's.  And the there is the whole sexual elements.  Which is so interesting to think about in 2003, when being able to be authentically what we want to be is so valued. You see this woman and you want to step into the scene and tell her to be what she wants to be and not what she thinks society expects her to be.And the music is something else.  I am so impressed with how three women and their stories were so well intertwined but also separate and how the director  Stephen Daldry was able to so smoothly yet distinctly switch our attention so well, almost like watch three top tennis players playing on the same court. Each with their own style but so interconnected.This is one of the few movies I watch every few weeks simply because there is so much story in 114 minutes. It draws you back over and over.

See this film on your own merit if AND only if it really is a film you want to see.  Do not go by recommendations or the fact that it is one of the major (and well deserved) Oscar worthy contenders this year.  In some ways, `The Hours' reminds me of Fassbinder's `The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant' another film I absolutely love but would never recommend to anyone. Although each film is completely different from each other, both films are about successful women and both explore similar themes of homosexuality, suicide and depression (common themes for Fassbinder who eventually succumbed to an untimely end through suicide).  So it's understandable why many will not enjoy `The Hours' and why I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't already want to see it on their own merit.I won't go into the particulars of the film; by now everyone pretty much has an idea of what `The Hours' is about.  Instead I will say why I liked it so much.  What I found to be the most fascinating aspect of this film is how all the different stories tied together maintaining such an amazing linear quality. Throughout the film dramatic events that occur in one scene are carried over and applied seamlessly to the characters in the next scene.  The flow between characters and time periods is flawless, further accented by the engaging qualities of all the characters.  I also enjoyed how there were several events, three of which instantly come to mind, that are never addressed throughout the course of the film. Instead, they're left up to your own interpretation in spite of their importance to the story. I also enjoyed Toni Collette's cameo role as Julianne Moore's buxom 50s neighbor Kitty.

590913,AD2DDHLD6FRFM,B00005JKTI,Brad Baker,"[7, 12]","Stephen Daldry's new maxi-sleeper is here. Based on Michael Cunningham's brilliant novel, ""The Hours"" is (and will be for years to come) a stunning, jolting time-travel between three different centuries that is so real, it's all just about you and I and right now. Starting slow, the film opens with the apparent suicide of classic women's writer Virginia Woolf. A few scenes, an introduction to her husband, and the hypnoyic under-currents of Philip Glass's music opens the film. You are suddenly wisked away to the 20th century(1950) in Los Angeles, where a frustrated housewife deals with her unhappy husband and lonely, confused son. Not enough, the story transports to the year 2000, and two women living together, dealing with the up-coming demise of one's former male lover from AIDS. You need to know more, but that's actually quite enough. Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris, Jeff Daniels, and a surprising Claire Danes complete the near-perfect acting core. Stabbing at age-old issues and opening the door on the unmentionable, ""The Hours"" builds to an emotional crescendo that is almost unbearable. You cannot take your eyes away. What is life about? Why are we here? Why am I married to this person? How do I escape this decaying marriage? Is suicide an option? How do I survive this very next....Hour. Deftly directed, expertly acted, ""The Hours"" is shocking...because it's real. It's hard to take. I sat down wIth a box of popcorn. The drama started unfolding. The guy next to me left the theater. Raw reality can hurt. ""The Hours"" is more than a melodrama about 3 lesbians and a series of unattractive males. It's about real people, and the consequences of what we do. As the movie ended, everyone filed slowly out. I was one of the last to leave. It took me awhile.

Superb writing distinguishes it from novelist Michael Cunningham and its adaptation into film by experienced screenwriter David Hare.  In lesser hands, this delicate, poetic work probably would have been crushed.  That they utilized an ultra talented ensemble cast sealed this into solid A territory. It is about the quiet desperation that is the way we lead our lives in the hours allocated to our existence.  The only thing that ends the Hours is Death and, for some, like Virginia Woolf, the Hours become so untenable that death must be hastened along with suicide. The women who follow Woolf in the future face the same battles with The hours even though we/they have the benefits of more modern existence.  Some universals never change though and The Hours are etched in stone as a universal.  Every actor is first rate but the two to be singled out for breathtaking performances are Nicole Kidman as Woolf and Ed Harris as a dying poet.  I was able to more fully realize how talented Kidman is by not being blinded by her movie star looks.  She drastically changes her appearance so as to become Woolf and she also is the most extraordinary on showing what it is like to live The Hours.  Her scenes with a dying bird and at the train station with her husband are incredible.  Harris is just getting better and better from role to role.  Seemingly there is no role beyond him and he doesn't care how likable or unlikable his character is.  Whatever he needs to do to get the job done, he'll do it.  In this case, he is desperation and dying personified as a poet dying in New York City of AIDS under the bleakest of circumstances, who turns out being linked to all three of our desperate women in one way or another.",5,The Hours: Lives of Quiet Desperation,1044403200,"02 5, 2003",2003,1772,"['excellent', 'film', 'made', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Superb', 'writing', 'distinguishes', 'novelist', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'adaptation', 'film', 'experienced', 'screenwriter', 'David', 'Hare', 'lesser', 'hands', 'delicate', 'poetic', 'work', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'crushed', 'utilized', 'ultra', 'talented', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'sealed', 'solid', 'A', 'territory', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'way', 'lead', 'lives', 'hours', 'allocated', 'existence', 'only', 'thing', 'Hours', 'Death', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Hours', 'become', 'so', 'untenable', 'death', 'must', 'be', 'hastened', 'suicide', 'women', 'who', 'follow', 'Woolf', 'future', 'face', 'same', 'battles', 'hours', 'even', 'we/they', 'have', 'benefits', 'more', 'modern', 'existence', 'universals', 'never', 'change', 'Hours', 'are', 'etched', 'stone', 'universal', 'actor', 'first', 'rate', 'two', 'be', 'singled', 'out', 'breathtaking', 'performances', 'are', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Woolf', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'dying', 'poet', 'was', 'able', 'more', 'fully', 'realize', 'how', 'talented', 'Kidman', 'not', 'being', 'blinded', 'movie', 'star', 'drastically', 'appearance', 'so', 'become', 'Woolf', 'also', 'most', 'extraordinary', 'showing', 'what', 'live', 'Hours', 'scenes', 'dying', 'bird', 'train', 'station', 'husband', 'are', 'incredible', 'Harris', 'just', 'getting', 'better', 'better', 'role', 'role', 'Seemingly', 'role', ""n't"", 'care', 'how', 'likable', 'unlikable', 'character', 'do', 'get', 'job', 'done', ""'ll"", 'do', 'case', 'desperation', 'dying', 'personified', 'poet', 'dying', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'AIDS', 'bleakest', 'circumstances', 'who', 'out', 'being', 'linked', 'three', 'desperate', 'women', 'one', 'way']",The Hours
590919,A1YYBC3O7KHQKK,B00005JKTI,Carter,"[0, 0]","Like many good things in life, this film isn't easy.  But like most hard things, The Hours first presents us with the difficult and then reveals a wisdom that leaves us feeling somehow better ... enriched.  Plots are sufficiently covered in many of the other reviews on this site.  Suffice to say, each of the three protagonists deals with enormously difficult circumstances, and each charts a courageous path through them in order to make life-affirming decisions to escape suffocating social conventions or deeply conflicting relationships.  Individually, these stories might have been slow-paced. But the almost seamless interweaving, together with magnificent performances, provide for more than ample momentum.  To say that The Hours is an ensemble performance would be a great understatement--more like the visual expression of a fine orchestral concert.  It will touch you more like a piece of music than a cognitive device.  The Hours may seem on the surface consumed with the dreary and morbid. But its greatest achievement is that it pierces through sad events, wrenches the viewer's heart with emotional authenticity, and delivers a vibrant, life-affirming message.  There is no hot without cold, no up without down, no happiness without sadness.  Life is a thousand joys and a thousand sorrows.  And it's the experience of sorrow--the reckoning, the recovery, the personal growth--that reveals the exquisiteness of life.  It is transformative pain above all else that enriches us and makes us wise.  The Hours celebrates THAT wisdom. The viewer could be forgiven for criticizing Daldry and Hare for obscuring the message with too much sadness.  As one amazon reviewer wrote, The Hours made him want to ""rent an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie (well, almost).""

590928,AP0DQSDFSLP4P,B00005JKTI,"Christopher M. MacNeil ""Chris M""","[2, 2]","Exquisite and beautified by four flawless performances, ""The Hours"" is a period and character study of characters whose lives are, for whatever reason, unfulfilled and made unbearable by inner demons or the fates already pre-determined. Brilliant but tormented author Virginia Woolf's dark novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" is the thread that connects the writer's character of 1921 and 1941 to those in 1951 and 2001. Each time frame has its own lead character painfully recognizing and then coming to terms somehow with the anquish and disappointments of their own lifes, and the power of the film is that each character superbly conveys the torment of their lives. Little wonder that Nicole Kidman, truly nearly unrecognizable, copped a richly deserved Best Actress Oscar for her devastating portrayal of the doomed Virginia Woolf. But, if it could have been, Oscars were as worthy for Julianna Moore as the '50s housewife who can't be contented with the facade of family harmony in that sedate decade, and for the incomparable Meryl Streep in her study of the contemporary character whose life seems to be lived as an extension of others. As a lifelong friend of Streep's character, actor Ed Harris delivers an equally painful and stirring performance as a gay man dying of AIDS. Far from being a ""feel-good"" movie, ""The Hours"" is an emotional experience for anyone who has hit the point when life doesn't seem to be enough and where the desperation stemming from absolute unhappiness can take us. Though it offers little to feel good about, the film is nonetheless a powerful force that begs the question how much of life each of us needs to be happy. The film's leads are no less powerful in conveying it and then looking for answers, some that, tragically, don't always exist.

590930,AE2KCASMQPMO,B00005JKTI,"C. Meja ""CMM""","[1, 2]","Virginia Woolf is writing Mrs. Dalloway in a country house. A suburban wife prepares for her husband's brithday and a lesbian mother wants to give her best friend a party (for an award he has won). These three moments reflect the complexity of life in three diferent times. These three moments reflect the conflicts of repression, passion, madness and compromise. Without a doubt the most important dialogue of the movie is said by Woolf, as she decides not to kill Mrs. Dalloway: It must be the visionary... she has to kill the poet. This line just gave me the chills as I heard for the first time. It is the poet closing the circle the one who dies... the one who takes his own life... it is her and it is the little abandoned boy. Woolf must stay in the country because the city is driving her mad, but it is her choice, and she cannot live being in the margin of the world. She must be in the most trivial parties, she must be in the most absurd rhythm of the city, because it is the world, and she cannot live aside from it. It is the poet's death which redeems society. It seems to give some sense to those plain unwanted lifes. Like that suburban woman, who has escaped from the horrors of war through a marriage she didn't want, and which represses her true desires.I've heard so many times that this is a sad movie. It was not to me. It was wonderfull and beautiful. Even the suicide scenes are beautiful. Kidman really earned her oscar in this movie (though I think she really deserved it the year before, for The Others, instead of Halle Berry). And it was just a crime the Julianne Moore did not won for her role (come on!, what is wrong here? when I could point several floppy and flawed scenes in Chicago!).This is a movie about thinking and it is for you to think. what is the relation between poetry and art, and the everyday life... no, not entertainment and life... art and life. It is about finding the real poet of the world, the one compromised enough to it, to the point of die for it (and when I say the world I mean it in its more human sense -I am not talking here about politics, or warriors or killers).",5,The poet found,1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,2130,"['Virginia', 'Woolf', 'writing', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'country', 'house', 'suburban', 'wife', 'prepares', 'husband', 'brithday', 'lesbian', 'mother', 'give', 'best', 'friend', 'party', 'award', 'won', 'three', 'moments', 'reflect', 'complexity', 'life', 'three', 'diferent', 'times', 'three', 'moments', 'reflect', 'conflicts', 'repression', 'passion', 'madness', 'compromise', 'doubt', 'most', 'important', 'dialogue', 'movie', 'said', 'Woolf', 'not', 'kill', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'must', 'be', 'visionary', 'kill', 'poet', 'line', 'just', 'gave', 'chills', 'heard', 'first', 'time', 'poet', 'closing', 'circle', 'one', 'who', 'one', 'who', 'own', 'life', 'little', 'abandoned', 'boy', 'Woolf', 'must', 'stay', 'country', 'city', 'driving', 'mad', 'choice', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'being', 'margin', 'world', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'trivial', 'parties', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'absurd', 'rhythm', 'city', 'world', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'aside', 'poet', 'death', 'society', 'give', 'sense', 'plain', 'unwanted', 'lifes', 'suburban', 'woman', 'who', 'escaped', 'horrors', 'war', 'marriage', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'true', 'desires.I', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'sad', 'movie', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'wonderfull', 'beautiful', 'Even', 'suicide', 'scenes', 'are', 'beautiful', 'Kidman', 'really', 'earned', 'oscar', 'movie', 'think', 'really', 'deserved', 'year', 'before', 'Others', 'instead', 'Halle', 'Berry', 'was', 'just', 'crime', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'did', 'not', 'won', 'role', 'come', 'what', 'wrong', 'here', 'when', 'could', 'point', 'several', 'floppy', 'flawed', 'scenes', 'Chicago', '.This', 'movie', 'thinking', 'think', 'what', 'relation', 'poetry', 'art', 'everyday', 'life', 'not', 'entertainment', 'life', 'art', 'life', 'finding', 'real', 'poet', 'world', 'one', 'compromised', 'enough', 'point', 'die', 'when', 'say', 'world', 'mean', 'more', 'human', 'sense', '-I', 'am', 'not', 'talking', 'here', 'politics', 'warriors', 'killers']",The Hours
590931,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,B00005JKTI,C. Middleton,"[3, 5]","When sitting down to review this superb film, at first the task proved to be problematic. This picture is an adaptation of a prize-winning novel by Michael Cunningham, which is loosely based on one of the great modernist novels of the last century, Mrs. Dalloway. In many respects, too, the film touches on the author's life, Virginia Woolf. The singular genius of the film is its fundamental structure, in terms of running all the aforementioned pieces and their themes in tandem. This is extremely clever because this was Woolf's intent when writing Mrs. Dalloway: connecting apparently disparate people and themes in a coalescent manner. Virginia Woolf was an experimental novelist, who successfully used the literary technique known as stream of consciousness. Breaking away from the conventional realist or naturalist forms used predominately in the 19th century, where the narrative was carried along by way of external action, this new technique moved the action into the characters mind, known as interior monologue. In Mrs Dalloway, we are invited into Clarice's mind, gaining access to her memories of childhood and relationships, and at the same time, her life parallels Septimus Warren Smith, a war veteran on the edge of insanity. Their lives become interconnected on a level of thought and time.  In ~The Hours~ the lives of three women, existing in three different time periods, run parallel to each other, all searching for meaning, all connected on levels of thought, circumstance and time, all in one seamless narrative.In many films the majority of burden is on the main character, the lead actor, to ensure the project is a success. As there are three distinct narratives in this film, and three leading actors, it would have only taken one weak performance to turn this film into a disaster. I believe the producers knew this and managed to hire probably the top three female actors in Hollywood.  Only one received the Oscar, Nicole Kidman, in the role of Virginia Woolf. However, Meryle Streep as Clarisa Vaughn and Julian Moore as Laura Brown put in outstanding performances, who more than deserved this recognition as well.This is a complicated film but a beautiful one with a haunting soundtrack by Phillip Glass, which demands to be viewed more than once to discover its many nuances, allusions and their connections.",5,Seamless connections...,1073088000,"01 3, 2004",2004,2344,"['When', 'sitting', 'down', 'review', 'superb', 'film', 'first', 'task', 'proved', 'be', 'problematic', 'picture', 'adaptation', 'prize-winning', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'loosely', 'based', 'one', 'great', 'modernist', 'novels', 'last', 'century', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'many', 'respects', 'too', 'film', 'touches', 'author', 'life', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'singular', 'genius', 'film', 'fundamental', 'structure', 'terms', 'running', 'aforementioned', 'pieces', 'themes', 'tandem', 'extremely', 'clever', 'was', 'Woolf', 'intent', 'when', 'writing', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'connecting', 'apparently', 'disparate', 'people', 'themes', 'coalescent', 'manner', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'was', 'experimental', 'novelist', 'who', 'successfully', 'used', 'literary', 'technique', 'known', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'Breaking', 'away', 'conventional', 'realist', 'naturalist', 'forms', 'used', 'predominately', '19th', 'century', 'where', 'narrative', 'was', 'carried', 'way', 'external', 'action', 'new', 'technique', 'moved', 'action', 'characters', 'mind', 'known', 'interior', 'monologue', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'are', 'invited', 'Clarice', 'mind', 'gaining', 'access', 'memories', 'childhood', 'relationships', 'same', 'time', 'life', 'parallels', 'Septimus', 'Warren', 'Smith', 'war', 'veteran', 'edge', 'insanity', 'lives', 'become', 'interconnected', 'level', 'thought', 'time', '~The', 'Hours~', 'lives', 'three', 'women', 'existing', 'three', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'run', 'parallel', 'other', 'searching', 'meaning', 'connected', 'levels', 'thought', 'circumstance', 'time', 'one', 'seamless', 'narrative.In', 'many', 'films', 'majority', 'burden', 'main', 'character', 'lead', 'actor', 'ensure', 'project', 'success', 'are', 'three', 'distinct', 'narratives', 'film', 'three', 'leading', 'actors', 'would', 'have', 'only', 'taken', 'one', 'weak', 'performance', 'turn', 'film', 'disaster', 'believe', 'producers', 'knew', 'managed', 'hire', 'probably', 'top', 'three', 'female', 'actors', 'Hollywood', 'Only', 'one', 'received', 'Oscar', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'role', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'However', 'Meryle', 'Streep', 'Clarisa', 'Vaughn', 'Julian', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'put', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'who', 'more', 'deserved', 'recognition', 'well.This', 'complicated', 'film', 'beautiful', 'one', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'be', 'viewed', 'more', 'once', 'discover', 'many', 'nuances', 'allusions', 'connections']",The Hours

It is based on the novel of the same name, which in turn pays homage to Virginia Woolf's, ""Mrs. Dalloway."" The movie demands the viewer's attention and concentration.""The Hours"" follows three women from different cities and eras: Virginia Woolf in London in the 1920's (Nicole Kidman); a post-WW II housewife in Los Angeles (Julianne Moore); and a book editor who lives in New York in the present day (Meryl Streep).Numerous clever cuts and transitions link the stories (e.g., one woman cracks an egg and then the movie transitions to another woman doing the same thing) as well as more profound underlying emotions (Woolf had female relationships, Moore's character kisses another female character, Streep lives with a female lover).I would recommend that a viewer read or see ""Mrs. Dalloway"" (Vanessa Redgrave played the role a few years ago) before ""The Hours."" It's not required but it increases your appreciation for the movie. For example, in ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" a character named Clarissa Dalloway spends the day planning a party and thinking about a long ago kiss to a woman (she's been married for years). In ""The Hours,"" Meryl Streep's character spends her day in party preparations and thinks about a long-ago heterosexual relationship (she is now in a lesbian one). I wouldn't recommend reading the actual ""The Hours"" before seeing  the movie: a plot twist late in the story would be ruined.The performances are for the most part outstanding with Kidman and Streep the standouts to me. I found Ed Harris in the role of the modern day Clarissa's close friend stricken with AIDS (and her lover from years ago), a bit over the top.

Beyond the greatest actress of our time, everything else is absolutely brilliant about this remarkable film following the hours in three women's lives in different decades, each with similiar and compelling problems.  Nicole Kidman is perfect as Virginia Wolfe, the depressed writer dealing with a life that is stifling her, a world that she desperately wants to escape.  Julianne Moore is superb again (also giving another great performance in ""Far From Heaven"") as a 50s house wife that is also living in a life that she can't bare living.  Meryl plays the modern gal, rounding out the trio and all three are drawn together in some way by the book Virginia is writing called ""Mrs. Dalloway"".  Both Moore and Kidman received Oscar nominations for their roles and its a disappointment that Meryl didn't receive one as well.  But nonetheless, the entire film is beautifully directed and acted.

Nicole Kidman's performance is the best in her career, making her well deserved of her Oscar win for Best Actress.  Julianne Moore showcases her continuing strive for improvement, which she's done since ""Boogie Nights"".  No words can describe how wonderful of an actress Meryl Streep is!  Her three-year hiatus was worth the wait.  No one can forget the other great performances of John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Claire Danes, Miranda Richardson, and.......Ed Harris.  Harris should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor(not Chris Cooper), which he was nominated for.Because of all these wonderful performances, you can feel what it's like to live in an unhappy world.

Wait till you feel better about life. I found myself on the verge of dropping tears at the end and that does not happen to me.

The cinematography is striking, shifts between scenes unlocking the interrelationship between these women are incredibly well guided and performances of all the stars involved in this film are superb.

The script written David Hare weaves together the struggles of these characters in a way that really brings each of their stories into focus and makes the final moment almost as powerful as the first.

590942,A23GFTVIETX7DS,B00005JKTI,Debbie Lee Wesselmann,"[3, 3]","After having read Michael Cunningham's novel, I could not imagine how a successful movie could be made from it.  With its three separate plots, I expected visual confusion and disjointedness.  Instead, I was stunned by how expertly everything was brought together.  The adaptation is both first-rate and insightful, excising the extraneous and focusing on the most crucial matters contained within the original novel.  ""The Hours"" instantly earned its place in my heart as one of my favorite movies.The film begins and ends with the suicide of Virginia Woolf, a writer driven by madness and a passion for both life and death.  Director Daldry then jumps to the 1950's as pregnant Laura Brown wakes up to her oppressive suburban life, and then to the 1990's as Clarissa Vaughn jumps from bed to prepare for a party for her dying best friend, a poet striken with AIDS.  Just as quickly, the audience is taken back to Virginia Woolf as she, too, embarks on a new day, one which will result in her penning of the beginning of her famous novel MRS. DALLOWAY.  The beginning is probably the most confusing part of the film as Daldry establishes these three separate lives in three disparate times; however, once the first five minutes has passed, everything is strongly established and easily discerned.  The minimalist soundtrack composed by Philip Glass couldn't be more perfect for this story of variations on a theme; the music creates tension by crescendo, then retreats into its quiet repetition, leaving the audience gasping.  I'm not sure how many people in the theater realized how well the music manipulated their reactions.Most of the action in this movie is psychological.  It is a film of close-ups, where a twitch or averting of the eyes tells volumes.  Because of this subtle nature, the acting must be brilliant and understated.  Fortunately, it is - and then some.  Nicole Kidman's portrayal of the tormented and brilliant Virginia Woolf is extraordinary; she IS Virginia Woolf.  Julianne Moore also turns in an expert performance, while Meryl Streep is, well, very Meryl Streep - perhaps too much so.  Claire Danes, in her brief appearance as Clarissa's daughter, illuminates and enlivens everything around her.  Allison Janney as Clarissa's lover Sally provides a competent and natural performance, although her role is more ornamentation than character.  So much has been said about the actresses in this film that one of the best performances is often overlooked:  Ed Harris as the dying poet, Richard.If you hate art films or crave fast-moving plots, you'll be disappointed with the deeply psychological nature and thematic development of ""The Hours.""

Woolf, in part due to her own depression and self-deprecation, abandoned realist literature with her novel and concentrated instead on the thoughts of her characters.  In the pages of her book human fragility is exposed, and this fragility permeates two other women in two different times:  a lonely, restless housewife in 1950's Los Angeles (Julianne Moore); and a present-day career woman (Meryl Streep) who is busily planning a party for a dying friend.  This film moves superbly from one place in time--from one character's growing angst and sense of misgiving--to another, until at last the three separate stories are tied together in astonishing and remarkable fashion.Kidman, Moore, and Streep are incomparable; the supporting cast (including Ed Harris in a brief, yet haunting role) is stellar.

590948,A1AYEI2SNFPYES,B00005JKTI,Dogville,"[3, 6]","""The Hours"" is easily the best movie of 2002/2003.Based on a Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, ""The Hours"", it recounts a single day in the life of three women from different times: Virginia Woolf (1923), Laura Brown (1951) and Clarissa Vaughn (2001).We get three different stories of true emotions, each heartfelt in its own way, combined into over 100 mintues of complex feelings that will have you in tears a couple of times before the end credits start to roll.The central point of cohesion is Viginia Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Virginia Woolf, an author troubled by by own insanity in Richmond (1923) is in the midst of writing her bookMrs Dalloway. Choosing between living in Richmond and death, Virginia Woolf will finally succumb to the voices in her head by killing herself.Almost 30 years later, a lonely housewife, Laura Brown in Los Angeles (1951) picks up the book for a read and questions her own life and feelings. She decides to leave while the impact on her son, Richard, is so devastating in years to come. The movie hits a high in a scene when Julianne Moore's character becomes engulfed in a sea of water while in bed.In 2001, a New York City gay woman being nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her dying AIDS friend, Richard, questions her own existence and priorities when Richard re-ascertains his love for her before leaping to his death, another emotional high in the movie.In this well-executed movie, the cast has given stellar performances and props go to all three lead actresses. Nicole Kidman delivers a performance of a lifetime delivering a  convinving portrayal of one of the leading authors of all time. Her performance shines through in the scene when she argues with her husband for her own existence at the train station. Perfect!Julianne Moore is the most outstanding here in her portrayal of a lonely housewife who makes a daring choice to break free and later confronts her son's suicide leap with much bitterness. If there were two Oscars to give, she sure deserves one too.

In the 1920's, Nicole Kidman plays Virginia Woolf, who, plagued by mental illness yet blessed with a nurturing, devoted husband, begins writing her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;. In the late 1940's, Julianne Moore plays a housewife who is at the same time reading &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and contemplating suicide. In present day, Meryl Streep plays a New York book editor who is caring for her sick and increasingly spiteful friend and former lover. The film deals with an incredible array of difficult issues. Almost all of the characters in the film display some kind of same-sex attraction, which many of them don't seem to know how to deal with (at one point Virginia shares a long and inappropriate kiss with her sister). And all three of the main characters are living on the edge of sanity, desperately trying to cope both with their roles as mothers and caretakers and with their own demons and unfulfilled desires. Although this is at times a very difficult film to watch, it's mostly because the pain and anguish of the characters is just so real, mosty due to the excellent performances by everyone in the film. And while the connection between the women seems initially to be nothing more than &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;, toward the end of the film two of the main characters' stories come together in an unexpected and heartbreaking way.

590955,AC1K4OQOZ90RS,B00005JKTI,"E. Bukowsky ""booklover10""","[0, 0]","""The Hours,"" based on the Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Cunningham, is a movie about three women, all of whom have a kinship to Virginia Woolf's character of Mrs. Dalloway. The three women, played in three different eras, are Virginia Woolf herself, Laura Brown, a fifties housewife, and Clarissa Vaughan, an editor living in contemporary New York.Nicole Kidman is superb as Virginia Woolf. She captures Woolf's brooding intensity and recurring madness to perfection, and her vulnerability makes one's heart ache. Julianne Moore turns in another fine performance as Laura Brown, a suburban housewife who is depressed in spite of having a loving husband and an adorable little boy. Brown feels that she must escape or kill herself. Finally, Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughan, a successful editor who lives with her female lover. Clarissa also spends a great deal of time tending to Richard, a close friend who is dying of AIDS.Stephen Daldry does a fine job of eliciting sensitive and compelling performance from a very fine cast, and the screenplay is faithful to the book without following it slavishly. However, the background score is too loud and intrusive, as if the director wants to emphasize that these people are going through major crises.In addition, for those people who are not familiar with Virginia Woolf's life and writings, it is unclear why Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughan are so unhappy. Laura may be bored with her life, but it is hard to understand why she could not have found some accommodation less drastic than the one that she ultimately chose. Clarissa's angst is also puzzling, since she has a full life, and is surrounded by people who love her. She is an attractive, vivacious, intelligent and successful individual. Her life matters.Therefore, although the acting in ""The Hours"" is absolutely dazzling, I suspect that the message may be a bit cloudy for some viewers. Still, I urge you to see ""The Hours"" for the wonderful performances by a very talented cast.",4,Superb performances lend distinction to this unusual movie.,1048377600,"03 23, 2003",2003,2001,"['Hours', 'based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'movie', 'three', 'women', 'whom', 'have', 'kinship', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'character', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'three', 'women', 'played', 'three', 'different', 'eras', 'are', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'fifties', 'housewife', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'editor', 'living', 'contemporary', 'New', 'York.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'superb', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Woolf', 'brooding', 'intensity', 'recurring', 'madness', 'perfection', 'vulnerability', 'one', 'heart', 'ache', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'fine', 'performance', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'suburban', 'housewife', 'who', 'depressed', 'spite', 'having', 'loving', 'husband', 'adorable', 'little', 'boy', 'Brown', 'feels', 'must', 'escape', 'kill', 'Finally', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'successful', 'editor', 'who', 'female', 'lover', 'Clarissa', 'also', 'great', 'deal', 'time', 'tending', 'Richard', 'close', 'friend', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS.Stephen', 'Daldry', 'fine', 'job', 'eliciting', 'sensitive', 'compelling', 'performance', 'very', 'fine', 'cast', 'screenplay', 'faithful', 'book', 'following', 'slavishly', 'However', 'background', 'score', 'too', 'loud', 'intrusive', 'director', 'emphasize', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'major', 'crises.In', 'addition', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'life', 'writings', 'unclear', 'why', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'are', 'so', 'unhappy', 'Laura', 'may', 'be', 'bored', 'life', 'hard', 'understand', 'why', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'found', 'accommodation', 'less', 'drastic', 'one', 'ultimately', 'chose', 'Clarissa', 'angst', 'also', 'puzzling', 'full', 'life', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'attractive', 'vivacious', 'intelligent', 'successful', 'individual', 'life', 'matters.Therefore', 'acting', 'Hours', 'absolutely', 'dazzling', 'suspect', 'message', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'cloudy', 'viewers', 'Still', 'urge', 'see', 'Hours', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'very', 'talented', 'cast']",The Hours
590956,AT6CZDCP4TRGA,B00005JKTI,Eduarrdo Nietzsche,"[3, 6]","This is one film that richly deserved its critical accolades, definitely worth owning, or at least repeated viewings.The characters are nuanced, with multiple and conflicting drives---not the tidy and simplistic cardboard-cutouts Hollywood usually comes up with.  The three women---Streep, Moore, and Kidman---are flawlessly directed and lead three vaguely connected, but very parallel lives.  Streep and Moore's characters reminded me of so, so many women I've known, both friends and family: women who maintain a happy facade (Streep as a dynamic, cheerful socialite and Moore as a placid suburbian housewife) behind which they are desperately empty, sad, and unfulfilled.Nicole Kidman puts in the finest performance of her career---I never would've expected it, given the usually vacuous roles she plays, but her Virginia Woolf is nothing short of amazing.  You can just feel the towering genius and passion behind the eerie, unhinged exterior.  Devoid of makeup and hair coloring, and wearing a bigger prosthetic nose, she actually looks a million times more attractive, and more human, than her usual generic-glam-blonde getup.Woolf's suicide was a courageous refusal to live a life (in her case, one of chronic mental illness) that she didn't want, could not change and could not otherwise escape.  Ed Harris's character also chooses suicide, rather than watch himself die slowly from AIDS.  For them, suicide is the only remaining gateway to freedoom and wholeness.Moore's character finds the only alternative to suicide is to desert her husband and children.  Only Streep's character dangles in the middle, mired in the same deep, gnawing and nameless discontent but not yet having found a way out.What many viewers may find deeply disturbing is the subtext that true existential FREEDOM---a beaten-to-death buzzword after 9/11---is not only very precious but very elusive.  Why?  Because most of us do not pass the crucible, are simply not willing to pay the REAL price of freedom: leaving behind everything that chains us down.  Even if that means killing yourself, or walking out on your family, or coming out of the closet.  Unwilling to let go of our lives, we become trapped in the misery of this clinging cowardice, we become prisoners who can only sit and wait for Death to come and get us, counting the hours dragging by.And Phillip Glass's magnificent score keeps everything moving along crisply, despite the film's title.",5,"Complex, quietly subversive and ballsy",1062460800,"09 2, 2003",2003,2440,"['one', 'film', 'deserved', 'critical', 'accolades', 'definitely', 'worth', 'owning', 'least', 'repeated', 'viewings.The', 'characters', 'are', 'nuanced', 'multiple', 'conflicting', 'drives', '-not', 'tidy', 'simplistic', 'cardboard-cutouts', 'Hollywood', 'usually', 'up', 'three', 'women', '-Streep', 'Moore', 'Kidman', '-are', 'flawlessly', 'directed', 'lead', 'three', 'vaguely', 'connected', 'very', 'parallel', 'lives', 'Streep', 'Moore', 'characters', 'reminded', 'so', 'so', 'many', 'women', ""'ve"", 'known', 'friends', 'family', 'women', 'who', 'maintain', 'happy', 'facade', 'Streep', 'dynamic', 'cheerful', 'socialite', 'Moore', 'placid', 'suburbian', 'housewife', 'are', 'desperately', 'empty', 'sad', 'unfulfilled.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'finest', 'performance', 'career', '-I', 'never', 'would', ""'ve"", 'expected', 'given', 'usually', 'vacuous', 'roles', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'nothing', 'short', 'amazing', 'can', 'just', 'feel', 'towering', 'genius', 'passion', 'eerie', 'unhinged', 'exterior', 'Devoid', 'makeup', 'hair', 'coloring', 'wearing', 'bigger', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'actually', 'million', 'times', 'more', 'attractive', 'more', 'human', 'usual', 'generic-glam-blonde', 'getup.Woolf', 'suicide', 'was', 'courageous', 'refusal', 'live', 'life', 'case', 'one', 'chronic', 'mental', 'illness', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'could', 'not', 'change', 'could', 'not', 'otherwise', 'escape', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'character', 'also', 'suicide', 'rather', 'watch', 'die', 'slowly', 'AIDS', 'suicide', 'only', 'remaining', 'gateway', 'freedoom', 'wholeness.Moore', 'character', 'only', 'alternative', 'suicide', 'desert', 'husband', 'children', 'Only', 'Streep', 'character', 'dangles', 'middle', 'mired', 'same', 'deep', 'gnawing', 'nameless', 'discontent', 'not', 'yet', 'having', 'found', 'way', 'many', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'deeply', 'disturbing', 'subtext', 'true', 'existential', 'FREEDOM', '-a', 'beaten-to-death', 'buzzword', '9/11', '-is', 'not', 'only', 'very', 'precious', 'very', 'elusive', 'Why', 'most', 'do', 'not', 'pass', 'crucible', 'are', 'simply', 'not', 'willing', 'pay', 'REAL', 'price', 'freedom', 'leaving', 'everything', 'down', 'Even', 'killing', 'walking', 'out', 'family', 'coming', 'closet', 'Unwilling', 'let', 'go', 'lives', 'become', 'trapped', 'misery', 'clinging', 'cowardice', 'become', 'prisoners', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'sit', 'wait', 'Death', 'come', 'get', 'counting', 'hours', 'dragging', 'by.And', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'magnificent', 'score', 'everything', 'moving', 'along', 'crisply', 'film', 'title']",The Hours

590958,A1V3S3Y5KAPPZW,B00005JKTI,Eric Anderson,"[10, 18]","This hotly anticipated film closely adapted from the novel written by Michael Cunningham is a triumph! The film takes place at three different times of a century. In the 1920s, Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living a fussy, closely monitored life in Richmond and has begun writing her novel Mrs. Dalloway. In the 1950s, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife in Los Angeles baking a cake for her husband's birthday. In 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is a New York City editor organizing a party for her old friend who just won a major poetry award. What we are given is a day in the life of each of these women. The film flips between these different points in time that are clearly demarcated by their settings. You may assume that this would make the individual stories confusing, but the women's lives are linked by various themes making transitions between them seem almost effortless. While each women is dealing with particularly difficult issues in their lives, all of them struggle with similar larger issues, primarily oppression, love and death.This is a film about and probably for women. As Jeanette Winterson said when discussing this film, ""I am really not sure that most men have evolved far enough to spend two hours without their own company."" Of course, this is not always the case. The story is weighed down at times by morbidity. But within the context of these three women's stories, they have good reason to be thinking strongly about the possibilities of escaping these cage like identities. Traditionally for women, the only escape has been death. However, each of these women find a unique way to deal with lives they find too difficult to take. The progressive avenues of escape taken through time leaves an ultimately optimistic feeling. All three of the leading ladies deliver fantastic performances. The director Stephen Daldry focused on subtle facial and hand gestures which illuminate the internal struggles these women are facing, but are unable to speak about. They have a tremendous supporting cast with powerful performance particularly from Stephen Dillante, Toni Collette and Jeff Daniels.

Although I concur with the critics that the acting by Nicole Kidman, et al. was superb, I found the movie to be morally sterile and bankrupt, its main characters selfish, despairing of life (although for unexplained reasons), and extremely self-absorbed.In the movie, the Nicole Kidman character (feminist-lesbian author Virginia Wolf)found life so unworthwhile that she committed suicide, although she had insisted in her suicide note that she and her husband had a great love and were happy together.  She must have known that her suicide would be immensely hurtful to her husband.  But never once was she concerned about him; instead, it's all about her.  Similarly, the character played by Moore abandoned a devoted husband, a precocious young boy who adored her, and a newborn girl--because she found suburban life as a housewife ""stifling."" Not only did her abandonment wreak a permanent emotional injury in her son, the movie did not inform us whether her ""liberated"" life was any better or meaningful or fulfilling.Frankly, I am surprised that no review I read had noted this about ""The Hours.""  Instead, the reviews celebrated the movie--and in so doing, I can only assume that the reviewers also endorsed the movie's implicit narcissistic message that ""If you're unhappy with your life, the solution is simply to end it, whether by suicide or physical abandonment of your family--regardless of the impact on those who love you.""",3,celebration of moral bankruptcy,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,1520,"['checked', 'out', 'Hours', 'movie', 'was', 'so', 'highly', 'touted', 'critics', 'concur', 'critics', 'acting', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'et', 'al', 'was', 'superb', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'morally', 'sterile', 'bankrupt', 'main', 'characters', 'selfish', 'despairing', 'life', 'unexplained', 'reasons', 'extremely', 'self-absorbed.In', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'character', 'feminist-lesbian', 'author', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'found', 'life', 'so', 'unworthwhile', 'committed', 'suicide', 'had', 'insisted', 'suicide', 'note', 'husband', 'had', 'great', 'love', 'were', 'happy', 'together', 'must', 'have', 'known', 'suicide', 'would', 'be', 'immensely', 'hurtful', 'husband', 'never', 'once', 'was', 'concerned', 'instead', 'Similarly', 'character', 'played', 'Moore', 'abandoned', 'devoted', 'husband', 'precocious', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'adored', 'newborn', 'girl', 'found', 'suburban', 'life', 'housewife', 'stifling', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'abandonment', 'wreak', 'permanent', 'emotional', 'injury', 'son', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'inform', 'liberated', 'life', 'was', 'better', 'meaningful', 'fulfilling.Frankly', 'am', 'surprised', 'review', 'read', 'had', 'noted', 'Hours', 'Instead', 'reviews', 'celebrated', 'movie', 'so', 'doing', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'reviewers', 'also', 'endorsed', 'movie', 'implicit', 'narcissistic', 'message', ""'re"", 'unhappy', 'life', 'solution', 'simply', 'end', 'suicide', 'physical', 'abandonment', 'family', 'regardless', 'impact', 'who', 'love']",The Hours

Then seeing the film adaptation spurred me on to reading MRS DALLOWAY yet again.  Now the DVD is out and I rank THE HOURS with my top five movie favorites.  Cunningham's genius-quality response to Virginia Woolf's novel, MRS DALLOWAY, successfully admixes one day in the lives of three women from different times - Virginia Woolf in 1923 as she devises her novel and the characters' fates; Laura Brown a fragile housewife/mother teetering on self destruction, and Clarissa Vaughn in 2001 an editor and mother in a longterm lesbian relationship - planning a &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;-type party for her AIDS ridden poet friend Richard. David Hare has written a screenplay that seamlessly weaves these three women's lives through the hours of one day: Virginia Woolf inhales, Clarissa exhales, Laura Brown stares into the same type space as both Virginia and Clarissa.  The result is a wondrous, intimate exploration of the value of living, a value than can without censure include taking one's own life.  The dialogue is mesmerizing, a script (and book) that leaves you wishing you could memorize each word and line.  Every one of the &quot;company&quot; roles is acted (and directed) with uncanny finesse - Toni Colette, Ed Harris, Allyson Janney, Charles Reilly  - all of them.  The Phillip Glass music score is the perfect choice to meld these ingredients into an unforgetable film.  Another great joy of buying this DVD is the additional history of Virginia Woolf and the Bloomsbury Group, the enlightened (for once) dialogue among Nicole Kidman, Myrl Streep, and Julianne Moore, and the comments by composer Glass, writers Cunningham and Hare, and director Daldry paying homage to a project which all began with Virginia Woolf.

Don't put this on when you're feeling sleepy.  The Philip Glass music sets the tone-- this is all aobut mood, stream of consciousness, atmosphere; this isn't a story with a whole lot of plot.  Not that there isn't any:  it's worth hanging in there because if you do, some of the story is heartbreaking.

Stephen Daldry, the director, and David Hare, the screenwriter, both come from the theatre, and to some extent their reharsal method is quaintly direct with that methodology (I'm also from theatre, and had to laugh at the thought of a film crew using set pieces and taping the floor to rehearse-- not very common in film where time is so short)-- but they are full of interesting insights.Michael Cunningham, who wrote the Pulitzer-prize winning book on which the movie is based, is also refreshingly down to earth, practical and humble, without being obsequious in his comments.  I watched about half of the movie with the commentary on, and found it very entertaining.  It's unusual to enjoy watching the commentary of a movie you didn't intend to see again, and evidence that the commentary is worthwhile.All of the actresses have been praised for their work, and they all deserve it:  Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore, and Nicole Kidman are all poignant and honest.

In the new York story, I winced looking at the face of the actor playing opposite Meryl Streep, and the obvious pain he was in both physically and psychologically. He had a great makeup artist too, he looked like death walking.Meryl Streep added to the brooding aptmosphere by throwing a party for him that no one, including him or her really wanted to take place. It gave me this distinct feeling of dread to contemplate where this entire situation was headed. In appreciation of her efforts he rubs his intense desire to die and end his pain in her face. The story revolved around their failed relationship, and their bitter compensational relationships afterwards.Time for Julianne Moore. She is throwing a party for her husband but she is too disturbed to even bake a cake properly. Ding Dong, it's her friend at the door announcing that she found a lump in her breast and she may have cancer. They proceed to comfort each other and end up making out in front of Julianne's 5 or six year old son.On to Virginia. I don't know much about who she was and I have never read any of her books so I can't comment on the ingenious tying together of the three stories. I plead ignorance in this, and if in doing so, I have lost so much of the story to make this review have any value at all, please excuse me. The movie introduces her to us throwing rocks in her dress and wading into a river. Her instability is obvious and her narrative, as far as I have scene is populated by scenes of death (the classic dead bird) and so on.Maybe I left too soon, but this movie seemed too sad and futile to continue to be worth the 7 dollars I paid to see it. It is interesting maybe only for the sad and futile feeling it evokes. I have no interest in ever watching it again. It was Pandora's box, closed way too late. Hope just flew away over the horizon and left us with this dark, brooding monstrosity.",3,I had to leave in the middle of the movie,1059004800,"07 24, 2003",2003,2104,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'do', 'movie', 'can', 'usually', 'cope', 'gloomy', 'dark', 'hopeless', 'aptmosphere', 'populated', 'bunch', 'disgustingly', 'self', 'absorbed', 'women', 'terminally', 'ill', 'people', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'new', 'York', 'story', 'winced', 'looking', 'face', 'actor', 'playing', 'opposite', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'obvious', 'pain', 'was', 'physically', 'psychologically', 'had', 'great', 'makeup', 'artist', 'too', 'looked', 'death', 'walking.Meryl', 'Streep', 'added', 'brooding', 'aptmosphere', 'throwing', 'party', 'one', 'including', 'really', 'wanted', 'take', 'place', 'gave', 'distinct', 'feeling', 'dread', 'contemplate', 'where', 'entire', 'situation', 'was', 'headed', 'appreciation', 'efforts', 'rubs', 'intense', 'desire', 'die', 'end', 'pain', 'face', 'story', 'revolved', 'failed', 'relationship', 'bitter', 'compensational', 'relationships', 'afterwards.Time', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'throwing', 'party', 'husband', 'too', 'disturbed', 'even', 'bake', 'cake', 'properly', 'Ding', 'Dong', 'friend', 'door', 'announcing', 'found', 'lump', 'breast', 'may', 'have', 'cancer', 'proceed', 'comfort', 'other', 'end', 'up', 'making', 'out', 'front', 'Julianne', '5', 'six', 'year', 'old', 'son.On', 'Virginia', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'who', 'was', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'ca', ""n't"", 'comment', 'ingenious', 'tying', 'together', 'three', 'stories', 'plead', 'ignorance', 'doing', 'so', 'have', 'lost', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'make', 'review', 'have', 'value', 'please', 'movie', 'throwing', 'rocks', 'dress', 'wading', 'river', 'instability', 'obvious', 'narrative', 'as', 'far', 'have', 'scene', 'populated', 'scenes', 'death', 'classic', 'dead', 'bird', 'so', 'on.Maybe', 'left', 'too', 'soon', 'movie', 'seemed', 'too', 'sad', 'futile', 'continue', 'be', '7', 'dollars', 'paid', 'see', 'interesting', 'maybe', 'only', 'sad', 'futile', 'feeling', 'have', 'interest', 'ever', 'watching', 'again', 'was', 'Pandora', 'box', 'closed', 'way', 'too', 'late', 'Hope', 'just', 'flew', 'away', 'horizon', 'left', 'dark', 'brooding', 'monstrosity']",The Hours

I have nothing but the highest respect for Nicole Kidman as an actress, and donning a fake nose to tone down her pretty face was a wonderful choice. Julianne Moore, who I believe was the real star of this film, just goes to show how dialogue is secondary to body language and facial expressions. She says very little, but she carrys the film. Meryl Streep, of course, does an excellent job as well - her breakdown with in the kitchen was very believable. And you know the acting must be good with a supporting cast like Claire Danes, Ed Harris, and John C. Riley, all of whom do incredible, incredible jobs.This is a movie of atmosphere, of characters. It has hardly any action at all - buying flowers becomes a big event. The whole mood of the movie is dark - not exactly depressed, but teetering on the edge. These women haven't exactly given up, but they are close to breaking, and so is the viewer.Perhaps the best thing about this movie was the ending. One woman said ""Well that was just depressing."" In actuality, I think this film was very uplifting, almost life-affirming. ""The poet."" Says Virginia, ""The poet must die, so that others can better appreciate life.""I didn't really care for the lesbian overtones, but they weren't too bad. This is not a movie for a good time, or a laugh. ""The Hours"" is a very deep, thinking movie that takes a certain kind of person to appreciate it.

590974,A9I40WFF40R4,B00005JKTI,"H. F. Corbin ""Foster Corbin""","[6, 6]","I would have given this movie the Oscar for best movie of 2002. Adapted from Michael Cunningham's fine novel and directed by Stephen Daldry, who, as I remember, directed BILLY ELLIOTT as well, this film has everything going for it: first rate acting by everyone involved, beautiful cinematography, music by Philip Glass-- a composer I'm usually not into, but his compositions work perfectly here-- and a thoughtful plot.The action covers one day in the lives of each of three women. We see Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) on the day she commits suicide in 1923. We visit Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) on a day in 1951, the day she decides not to commit suicide; and finally, Clarissa Vaughn played by Meryl Streep on a day in 2001 when she is planning a party for her writer friend Richard (Ed Harris)who is dying of AIDS. The action goes back and forth among these three dates. Laura Brown and Clarissa Vaughn are connected to Virginia Woolf because of her novel MRS. DALLOWAY. Laura Brown is reading MRS. DALLOWAY, Virginia Woolf is working on the novel and Richard calls Clarissa &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;The photography is quite wonderful here and helps to hold the movie together. For example, the same images are repeated in each time sequence. Virginia arrives at the first line of her novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers, herself&quot;and proceeds to arrange flowers. Laura's husband buys her flowers for &quot;his&quot; birthday, which she arranges. Finally Clarissa goes shopping to buy tons of flowers for Richard's party. There are also images of eggs being broken as the characters prepare food, the different women in bed, the scenes of the three women washing their faces, the three women kissing other women, and finally, on each day someone arrives early. These visual images make the plot even smoother than in the novel, I think.Much has been made of Kidman's false nose. Nobody would recognize her as the stunning Australian actress here as she is quite frumpy as Woolf. Meryl Streep is as alway magnificent. There is a stunning scene when she meets the older Laura Brown who makes her apology for leaving her children-- &quot;I chose life.&quot; Clarissa says nothing in words to condemn Laura. Her eyes tell it all. Acting doesn't get finer than this. As I recall Ed Harris got mixed reviews when the movie first opened. I am at a loss to understand why. He is totally believable as someone in the last stages of AIDS; indeed, some of his scenes are almost too painful to watch.There are great lines in this film, some of them straight out of the novel. Woolf: &quot;Even crazy people want to be asked.&quot; She wanted to &quot;look life in the face.&quot; Richard: &quot;I have to face the hours.&quot; &quot;I have stayed alive for you. Now you [Clarissa] have to let me go.&quot; Clarissa remembers a day years ago when she and Richard were young and in love and there was such a sense of possibility. &quot;We thought it was the beginning of happiness, but it was happiness.&quot;The movie says so much about so many things that are important-- death, suicide, insanity, illness, friendship and, above all, love. I don't mean to make the movie sound trite. Is is far from that.

590982,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B00005JKTI,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[7, 11]","This film is extremely disquieting. It is centered on Virginia Wolf and her character Mrs Dolloway. This character, this book is transmitted then through two generations of people with very catastrophic consequences. The book, like Virginia Wolf, is haunted by suicide, by death, by those hours during which a person lives death in life waiting for death, expecting death, preparing death, the hours after death that can only be imagined and that are seen as a liberation from life, from a life haunted by death. The fate of Mrs Dolloway is transmitted to a female reader a few decades later, but this woman who tries the road to death steps back and chooses life. So she abandons her family, her son and daughter, her husband and goes to Toronto. But the seed of suicide is transmitted to her son, who will become a poet, and he will court death to the end like the poet in Mrs Dolloway. He will meet love in a woman and apparently have a daughter from her, or is it really from her ? But he will be a poet, the poet of Mrs Dolloway, to the end of his life. He will look for dangerous situations and dangerous experiments. He will get AIDS and he will eventually commit suicide on the very day when he is recognized as a great poet, as the great poet he is, because he cannot go on living with his disease, with his pills, with his fate, waiting for death to come when it wants, leaving him abandoned and stranded in the hours before death, hours that can last years because of the treatment he gets. So Virginia Wolf will drown away in a river and the poet, Richard, will jump from the sill of the window of his sick man's nook. And yet the film goes farther by concentrating on the suffering of Virginia Wolf's husband and of Richard's paramour. The suffering of those who are accompanying these people doomed to die by their own hands and decisions. A suffering that has no limits because it is like an accusation standing in the way, the accusation that their love has been a prison, that their love has been the prison from which those doomed people want to escape. The more they love, the more they try to protect, the more they try to motivate the other into living, the more they fail and the more the other wants to disappear, to cut short the hours of waiting for death and enter the hours of after death. Poignant. And the actors, especially the actresses are outstanding in their rendering of this suffering, of this exploration of death in life, of this witnessing of life in death. The composition of these actresses is so fine, so delicate, so sensitive that we hardly recognize them in their parts. Nicole Kidman is probably the most perfect rendition of this escape from any image of her we may have in our mind's eye. They reach archetypal acting that makes the characters more important than the actresses. They disappear as concrete human beings in the fictional people they render on the screen. This leads to a feeling of absolute enslavement in our own lives and a desire to get out of these waiting hours in which we live with death behind the wings, a death we had never seen but that becomes omnipresent at this moment. Are we going to go down the way Mrs Dolloway is pointing at ? Are we going to be the woman who invented and created this Mrs Dolloway ? Are we going to be the poet of the book who says goodbye and disappears in the hours after the passing threshold of the end of life ?

590986,AL5OEDM8TPTKV,B00005JKTI,James Hiller,"[3, 10]","The HoursFrom a Pulitzer Prize winning book comes the movie event of the year. Imagine the lives of three separate women, each a reflection of the others, intertwined yet fiercely independent, and you have the cinematic masterpiece of ""The Hours"".Virginia Woolf. Laura Brown. Clarissa Vaughn. Two fictional, one is real. Three women who live a day in their lives that is a day that is their life. In her day, Woolf starts writing one of her masterpieces, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", which in her day, Laura Brown starts reading, which in her day, Clarissa Vaughn is living.This unique, tri-layered story allows for complexity not often found in film: writer, reader, and character, honoring each spirit wholly and totally. This powered the plot of the book, and the movie successfully managed to honor that device. When one thing happens to a character, it may or may not show up in another character's story. Part of the pleasure and surprise of watching ""The Hours"" is trying to find those story elements mirrored in each other's story, and this lends itself to multiple watchings.Whereas the story is unique, it's the beauty of the moments in ""The Hours"" that stun and awe any watcher. The buying of flowers. A funeral for a bird. A brief, questioning kiss. Despair in a hotel room. This isn't a film that has you at the edge of your seat, waiting for the next exciting, thrill seeking moment to grab you, but one that draws you in slowly, completely, as you wait to discover the blossoming of each of these women.What is thrilling is the performances. Nicole Kidman, almost unrecognizable as Woolf, has created a completely nuanced character. She is real, alive, complex. Try watching her performance and remembering her fantastic turn in ""Moulin Rouge"", and you'll appreciate her talent. Julianne Moore's internal pain as Laura Brown is so realized, it's palpable. Meryl Streep brings to reality a crumbling Clarissa with both dignity and pain. Clearly, these three complicated roles needed equally talented actresses.Some people may be put off by the film's subject matter, or pacing. But ""The Hours"" is a film that demands repeated viewings to appreciate everything it has to offer, which is, one of the best cinematic events in recent history.",5,"Many, Many, Many Hours",1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,2240,"['HoursFrom', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'book', 'movie', 'event', 'year', 'Imagine', 'lives', 'three', 'separate', 'women', 'reflection', 'others', 'intertwined', 'yet', 'fiercely', 'independent', 'have', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Hours', '.Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'Two', 'fictional', 'one', 'real', 'Three', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'day', 'lives', 'day', 'life', 'day', 'Woolf', 'writing', 'one', 'masterpieces', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'day', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'reading', 'day', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'living.This', 'unique', 'tri-layered', 'story', 'allows', 'complexity', 'not', 'often', 'found', 'film', 'writer', 'reader', 'character', 'honoring', 'spirit', 'wholly', 'totally', 'powered', 'plot', 'book', 'movie', 'successfully', 'managed', 'honor', 'device', 'When', 'one', 'thing', 'character', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'show', 'up', 'character', 'story', 'Part', 'pleasure', 'surprise', 'watching', 'Hours', 'trying', 'find', 'story', 'elements', 'mirrored', 'other', 'story', 'multiple', 'story', 'unique', 'beauty', 'moments', 'Hours', 'stun', 'awe', 'watcher', 'buying', 'flowers', 'funeral', 'bird', 'brief', 'questioning', 'kiss', 'Despair', 'hotel', 'room', ""n't"", 'film', 'edge', 'seat', 'waiting', 'next', 'exciting', 'thrill', 'seeking', 'moment', 'grab', 'one', 'slowly', 'completely', 'wait', 'discover', 'blossoming', 'thrilling', 'performances', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'almost', 'unrecognizable', 'Woolf', 'created', 'completely', 'nuanced', 'character', 'real', 'alive', 'complex', 'Try', 'watching', 'performance', 'remembering', 'fantastic', 'turn', 'Moulin', 'Rouge', ""'ll"", 'appreciate', 'talent', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'internal', 'pain', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'so', 'realized', 'palpable', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'reality', 'crumbling', 'Clarissa', 'dignity', 'pain', 'Clearly', 'three', 'complicated', 'roles', 'needed', 'equally', 'talented', 'actresses.Some', 'people', 'may', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'film', 'subject', 'matter', 'pacing', 'Hours', 'film', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'appreciate', 'everything', 'offer', 'one', 'best', 'cinematic', 'events', 'recent', 'history']",The Hours
590987,A1RECBDKHVOJMW,B00005JKTI,"Jana L. Perskie ""ceruleana""","[8, 10]","Michael Cunningham's award winning novel, &quot;The Hours,&quot; received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the PEN/Faulkner Award, and was chosen as Best Book of 1998 by The New York Times. Because the book is so extraordinary, I was apprehensive about how the film, based on this complex novel, could possibly succeed. David Hare performed a miracle in writing this true and beautiful adaptation, in a manner faithful to the book, and also suited for the big screen. He captured everything, including the important literary allusions, with great sensitivity and fidelity. Stephen Daldry's direction encouraged the superb talents of his ensemble cast. Daldry has once again proven to be a master of his craft.The film is a richly told, often tragic story, of the interwoven lives of three women, from three different periods in time. The common thread is Virginia Woolfe's novel Mrs. Dalloway.Virginia Woolfe, brilliantly portrayed by Nicole Kidman, is living in isolation with her husband Leonard in 1923. Ms. Woolfe has a long history of mental illness, and has attempted suicide twice. Her doctors and her husband agree that she will possibly find peace away from London. The literary couple is living in Richmond, where Leonard has set up a printing press, thinking to involve his wife in publishing. She has begun to write &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; the story of a day in the life of one woman, Clarissa Dalloway, &quot;a woman's whole life in a single day - and in that day her whole life.&quot; Virginia is plainly fixated on death. She understands the nature of her illness, and at one point explains to Leonard that although he must live with the burden of her illness, so must she. She decides that someone in her new novel must die. When Richard asks who will die, and why, Virginia responds,&quot;...the poet, the visionary will die, so that the others will value life more.&quot;Laura Brown, (Julianne Moore), is a young housewife, pregnant with her second child, in post-World War II, Los Angles. She is desperately unhappy in her marriage. Her husband, a war veteran, clearly worships her. Their young son, with a child's intense perception, senses the tension and unhappiness in his mother, that his father seems oblivious to. Laura begins reading Virginia Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, and is deeply affected by the novel. She begins to have doubts about her life choices, and despairs that suicide may be her only way out.Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), lives in contemporary Manhattan, and is an editor and writer. She could be a mirror image of a modern Mrs. Dalloway. Her closest friend, and former lover, Richard, a novelist and poet, actually calls Clarissa, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot; Like Woolfe's Mrs. Dalloway, Clarissa is giving a party, for Richard, who is about to receive a prestigious lifetime achievement award for his poetry. She sets off one beautiful morning, like Mrs. Dalloway, to buy flowers for her party. Then she visits Richard, whom she has taken care of for years. He is slowly dying of AIDS.The intermingling of the three women's lives, and their struggle to find meaning, outside of brief moments of happiness, is very powerful. The visual montage of the three women, is superb and so effective. It is almost a collage at times. The musical score is haunting, and adds much to the film's mood. And the acting is superior, not just by the three women, but by the entire supporting cast.The tension builds toward a powerful ending, which even though I read the book, still came as a surprise. This is a deeply moving film, about living out the hours of ones life, about love, survival, and about mental illness and creativity.

590989,A2EY1BJK2ETC37,B00005JKTI,Jason W. Qualls,"[2, 3]","Stephen Daldry's film, adapted from the novel by Michael Cunningham, is certainly flawed.  It doesn't quite achieve exactly what it tries to, and its mood is occasionaly, for lack of a better word, incorrect.Three women are trying to find something.  In 1920s England, Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is trying to find inspiration for her newest novel.  Thousands of miles away and several decades later, 1950s housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is trying to find time to read the aforementioned novel.  Even yet more miles and years away, Y2K socialite Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is trying to find something, too-- although we're never sure exactly what that is.  Long story short, the three stories are linked both on superficial and deeper levels, and a lesson is to be learned.  Hint: I think it has something to do with hours in the day.Daldry captures cinematic parallelism very well, but he fails to capture any form of parallelism in the persons of the three female leads.  Kidman is humorless, dry and cold; Moore is humbly subtle and conflicted; and Streep is curiously boisterous and campy.  Indeed, the three actresses all turn in riveting performances; notably Moore, whose Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress was overshadowed by her simultaneous nomination in another category for &quot;Far From Heaven.&quot;  Kidman, who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is ironically the weakest of the three leads and has the least screen time.The entire supporting cast is certainly the film's strongest asset, with strong performances from Jeff Daniels, Miranda Richardson, the delightful Toni Collette, and the underrated Stephen Dillane as the conflicted Leonard Woolf.  Others are sorely underutilized; namely Allison Janney, Claire Daines, and John C. Reilly.  However, Ed Harris, Best Supporting Actor nominee, is merely disappointing even at his best moments.The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is safe but adequate, and David Hare's screenplay is the same.  The musical score by Philip Glass is at times rather distracting-- it's one of those musical scores that is better when listened to by itself.

DALLOWAY is really a throwback to the great so-called &quot;weepies,&quot; or women's pictures of the Forties and Fifties. The strongest of the threads (and the most affecting) concerns an emotionally fragile housewife (Julianne Moore) barely keeping it together on a summer's day in the 40s in Los Angeles: the rhythms Moore and the wonderful child actor who plays her son are so assured and unnerving that it's almost painfully beautiful. Nicole Kidman garnered a great deal of critical attention (and an Academy Award) for wearing a prosthetic nose and playing Virginia Woolf herself during the composition of her greatest novel. Kidman looks and seems almost nothing like the real Woolf, but the performance is exceptional nonetheless: she almost seems to come unglued by dint of her sheer intellectual strength and sensitivity. In the weakest of the stories (a fault of the original novel), Meryl Streep is quite fine as a contemporary Mrs. Dalloway putting together a party for her best friend, a famous poet (Ed Harris) dying of AIDS, and she redeems the material here a good deal.

590991,A2MZ433E9LE90O,B00005JKTI,Jayne Ravencroft,"[14, 27]","I approached this movie as an opportunity to learn more about Virginia Woolf, of whom I knew a little. It was not without substantial eagerness that I sought to learn more about her from this film. But this movie is to no substantial degree the learning experience I had hoped for, scarcely more so than if I'd watched WILD WILD WEST with the hope of learning more about Ulysses S. Grant. So what is there to get out of THE HOURS? Nothing very tangible that meets one's eye. A discussion early on alludes to suicide and reasons for not taking one's life. We stay here on Earth for the sake of those we matter to, so one character asserts. That's a reason not to commit suicide, we're told, and we might suspect that would define a consistent theme of the movie. But not all its characters live out that sense of  purpose. Virginia Woolf didn't, either in real life or in THE HOURS (that point being the one unambiguous element of non-fiction I could find in the film). At least one other character also declines to stay around for those to whom he matters. But if one is looking for evidence either for or against staying around for loved ones as the theme of the movie, the most compelling evidence comes from Laura Brown, played by Julianne Moore. This gloomy and depressed character, forever on the verge of ""losing it"" decides not to commit suicide. Yet, she abandons her family anyway. So the movie's theme would seem more to be that choosing or not choosing suicide is beside the point relative to that claim that we should stay around for those to whom we matter. Even staying in this world doesn't mean that we'll be there for them.While Laura Brown's suicidal tendencies are rather unexplained, there is a hint as to why Virginia Woolf (at least the one in this movie, whether the real one or not) is having a crisis about going on. Part of the therapy for the conditions she suffers has her living in Richmond, a suburb of London. She longs to be back in the big city instead. I'll assume she has her reasons for wishing she were in London, however poorly explained they are in this movie. In fact the subject is poorly introduced. Apparently what is supposed to first hint at her bitterness over separation from London is a scene where her servants are preparing a meal. She tells them to use ginger. They respond that they are out of ginger and would have to go all the way to London to get any. She responds that she doesn't see a problem there. Her harsh words as she elaborates must be meant as the first sign of her torture over being condemned to this suburban life that she detests (however attractive the setting might look to a lot of us viewers). But a first time viewer of the movie is hard-put to discern such a message in this scene as it is playing. It is more likely to look like she is being haughty, even bordering on verbally abusive, toward her servants. You'd think the movie makers overlooked that obvious appearance in their zeal to portray sympathetically these supposedly parallel lives of three women .Yes, parallel lives -- at least that is what so many are saying about this movie. The paralles are implied between the real life of Virginia Woolf and two fictional women who lived later, one of them being the aforementioned Laura Brown. But how deep is the parallel? Laura reads Woolf's novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"". That's about it as far as a tangible parallel really goes. Are we supposed to think the parallel is grounded in ordinary reality, in some general aspects of ""the human condition""? Or is the parallel forged by some deeper, essentially supernatural influence? Little room for the latter possibility would seem to be allowed by the movie's tone, which does not at all generally seem to draw on supernatural effects. Yet, brief suggestions that Laura is somehow living out the life of Mrs. Dalloway are thrown into the mix. It is as if Laura is constrained to live out that life, according to how Woolf writes of her heroine (as if the two time lines were simultaneous, even though the novel was written a few decades earlier than the stage of Laura's life interspersed in the movie's flashbacks and flash-forwards). That particular plot element is indeed as if some curse or something doomed Laura to live out a literary character's life. There could be the potential for a supernatural thriller there, if the movie consistently pursued it. But the movie does not go for that option that could have made for entertaining, if somewhat escapist, fare. Instead the direction the movie does take is an incongrous, muddled mess that very weakly at best lives up to its billing as a profound exposition on parallel lives. Where so many would have us believe it delivers with a bang, its impact is really more of a whimper.",2,Might be better with consistent supernatural theme.,1049414400,"04 4, 2003",2003,4763,"['approached', 'movie', 'opportunity', 'learn', 'more', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'whom', 'knew', 'little', 'was', 'not', 'substantial', 'eagerness', 'sought', 'learn', 'more', 'film', 'movie', 'substantial', 'degree', 'learning', 'experience', 'had', 'hoped', 'scarcely', 'more', 'so', ""'d"", 'watched', 'WILD', 'WILD', 'WEST', 'hope', 'learning', 'more', 'Ulysses', 'S.', 'Grant', 'So', 'what', 'there', 'get', 'THE', 'HOURS', 'Nothing', 'very', 'tangible', 'one', 'eye', 'discussion', 'early', 'alludes', 'suicide', 'reasons', 'not', 'taking', 'one', 'life', 'stay', 'here', 'Earth', 'sake', 'matter', 'so', 'one', 'character', 'reason', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide', ""'re"", 'told', 'might', 'suspect', 'would', 'define', 'consistent', 'theme', 'movie', 'not', 'characters', 'live', 'out', 'sense', 'purpose', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'did', ""n't"", 'either', 'real', 'life', 'THE', 'HOURS', 'point', 'being', 'one', 'unambiguous', 'element', 'non-fiction', 'could', 'find', 'film', 'least', 'one', 'other', 'character', 'also', 'stay', 'whom', 'one', 'looking', 'evidence', 'staying', 'loved', 'ones', 'theme', 'movie', 'most', 'compelling', 'evidence', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'played', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'gloomy', 'depressed', 'character', 'forever', 'verge', 'losing', 'not', 'commit', 'suicide', 'family', 'anyway', 'movie', 'theme', 'would', 'seem', 'more', 'be', 'choosing', 'not', 'choosing', 'suicide', 'point', 'relative', 'claim', 'should', 'stay', 'whom', 'matter', 'Even', 'staying', 'world', ""n't"", 'mean', ""'ll"", 'be', 'there', 'them.While', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'suicidal', 'tendencies', 'are', 'rather', 'unexplained', 'hint', 'why', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'least', 'one', 'movie', 'real', 'one', 'not', 'having', 'crisis', 'going', 'Part', 'therapy', 'conditions', 'living', 'Richmond', 'suburb', 'London', 'be', 'back', 'big', 'city', 'instead', ""'ll"", 'assume', 'reasons', 'wishing', 'were', 'London', 'however', 'poorly', 'explained', 'are', 'movie', 'fact', 'subject', 'poorly', 'introduced', 'Apparently', 'what', 'supposed', 'first', 'hint', 'bitterness', 'separation', 'London', 'scene', 'where', 'servants', 'are', 'preparing', 'meal', 'use', 'ginger', 'respond', 'are', 'ginger', 'would', 'have', 'go', 'way', 'London', 'get', ""n't"", 'see', 'problem', 'there', 'harsh', 'words', 'must', 'be', 'meant', 'first', 'sign', 'torture', 'being', 'condemned', 'suburban', 'life', 'however', 'attractive', 'setting', 'might', 'look', 'lot', 'viewers', 'first', 'time', 'viewer', 'movie', 'hard-put', 'discern', 'message', 'scene', 'playing', 'more', 'likely', 'look', 'being', 'haughty', 'even', 'bordering', 'verbally', 'abusive', 'servants', ""'d"", 'think', 'movie', 'makers', 'overlooked', 'obvious', 'appearance', 'zeal', 'portray', 'sympathetically', 'supposedly', 'parallel', 'lives', 'three', 'women', '.Yes', 'parallel', 'lives', 'least', 'what', 'so', 'many', 'are', 'saying', 'movie', 'paralles', 'are', 'implied', 'real', 'life', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'two', 'fictional', 'women', 'who', 'lived', 'later', 'one', 'being', 'aforementioned', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'how', 'deep', 'parallel', 'Laura', 'Woolf', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'about', 'as', 'far', 'tangible', 'parallel', 'really', 'Are', 'supposed', 'think', 'parallel', 'grounded', 'ordinary', 'reality', 'general', 'aspects', 'human', 'condition', 'parallel', 'forged', 'deeper', 'essentially', 'supernatural', 'influence', 'Little', 'room', 'latter', 'possibility', 'would', 'seem', 'be', 'allowed', 'movie', 'tone', 'not', 'generally', 'seem', 'draw', 'supernatural', 'effects', 'brief', 'suggestions', 'Laura', 'somehow', 'living', 'out', 'life', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'are', 'thrown', 'mix', 'Laura', 'constrained', 'live', 'out', 'life', 'according', 'how', 'Woolf', 'heroine', 'two', 'time', 'lines', 'were', 'simultaneous', 'even', 'novel', 'was', 'written', 'few', 'decades', 'earlier', 'stage', 'Laura', 'life', 'interspersed', 'movie', 'flashbacks', 'flash-forwards', 'particular', 'plot', 'element', 'indeed', 'curse', 'something', 'doomed', 'Laura', 'live', 'out', 'literary', 'character', 'life', 'could', 'be', 'potential', 'supernatural', 'thriller', 'there', 'movie', 'consistently', 'pursued', 'movie', 'not', 'go', 'option', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'entertaining', 'somewhat', 'escapist', 'fare', 'Instead', 'direction', 'movie', 'take', 'incongrous', 'muddled', 'mess', 'very', 'weakly', 'best', 'up', 'billing', 'profound', 'exposition', 'parallel', 'lives', 'Where', 'so', 'many', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'bang', 'impact', 'really', 'more', 'whimper']",The Hours

590994,A2HW33PQSRHLNO,B00005JKTI,J from NY,"[1, 5]","This film genuinely surprised me, because from the outset I was determined not to like it at all and by the end of the film I wastotally absorbed in the tragic, shadowed lives of the characters, some of whom I liked, some I felt ambivalent toward, and some I loved.  If you are a fan of Virginia Woolf as a writer and have a working knowledge of her life, you'll have to put reality aside for awhile and just see her as the puppet master of this despairing symphony.First we have perhaps the only performance worthy of the title from Nicole Kidman, probably due to heavy makeup, as the disturbed but also sharply lucid writer Virginia Woolf.  Her facial expressions, mannerisms, and overriding obsession with death bring Woolf to life.  Meryl Streep overacts a bit as the middlewoman between the frenetic lives of three troubled characters, still managing in the end to pull it off gracefully.Ed Harris really surprised me as the sickly poet Richard, a wild product of Freudianism if ever there was one.  As with Kidman, he transcends his usual policy of turning in the same performance every film and shows he can actually act.What frustrated me is that he is so central to the film and yet his character is underdeveloped--all we really know is that he has been in touch with suicide from a young age and that his mother opted to destroy his life rather than take her own (I guess that's women's liberation) by leaving him as a young boy and also deserting her husband, who commits the malicious crime of being banal when talking over cake about how much he loves her.This is Julianne Moore, the most loathsome character in the whole film.  At the end they try to make her human after Richard (the famous poet played by Ed Harris and her son) jumps out a window, but it doesn't work.  She looks like an irresponsibile, cold old woman searching for a vague forgiveness she doesn't deserve.The scenes with Woolf and her caretaker/husband Leonard are all fantastic.  This is a complex film, but I think the underlying message is that the phenomenon of suicide and similar acts that seem unconscionable are simply matters of choice.  We can take our lives, leave our loved ones, etc, at will and there isn't anything to stop us.  Torment can reach a point at which the most deeply felt instincts and values no longer matter to us.Not a movie I'd necessarily watch again, but certainly poetic and a must see.",4,A Literate Exercise in Kevorkian Feminism,1153785600,"07 25, 2006",2006,2405,"['film', 'genuinely', 'surprised', 'outset', 'was', 'determined', 'not', 'like', 'end', 'film', 'wastotally', 'absorbed', 'tragic', 'shadowed', 'lives', 'characters', 'whom', 'liked', 'felt', 'ambivalent', 'loved', 'are', 'fan', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'writer', 'have', 'working', 'knowledge', 'life', ""'ll"", 'have', 'put', 'reality', 'aside', 'awhile', 'just', 'see', 'puppet', 'master', 'despairing', 'symphony.First', 'have', 'perhaps', 'only', 'performance', 'worthy', 'title', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'probably', 'due', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'disturbed', 'also', 'sharply', 'lucid', 'writer', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'facial', 'expressions', 'mannerisms', 'overriding', 'obsession', 'death', 'bring', 'Woolf', 'life', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'bit', 'middlewoman', 'frenetic', 'lives', 'three', 'troubled', 'characters', 'still', 'managing', 'end', 'pull', 'off', 'gracefully.Ed', 'Harris', 'really', 'surprised', 'sickly', 'poet', 'Richard', 'wild', 'product', 'Freudianism', 'ever', 'was', 'one', 'Kidman', 'usual', 'policy', 'turning', 'same', 'performance', 'film', 'can', 'actually', 'act.What', 'frustrated', 'so', 'central', 'film', 'yet', 'character', 'underdeveloped', 'really', 'know', 'been', 'touch', 'suicide', 'young', 'age', 'mother', 'opted', 'destroy', 'life', 'rather', 'take', 'own', 'guess', 'women', 'liberation', 'leaving', 'young', 'boy', 'also', 'deserting', 'husband', 'who', 'malicious', 'crime', 'being', 'banal', 'when', 'talking', 'cake', 'how', 'much', 'her.This', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'most', 'loathsome', 'character', 'whole', 'film', 'end', 'try', 'make', 'human', 'Richard', 'famous', 'poet', 'played', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'son', 'out', 'window', ""n't"", 'work', 'irresponsibile', 'cold', 'old', 'woman', 'searching', 'vague', 'forgiveness', ""n't"", 'deserve.The', 'scenes', 'Woolf', 'caretaker/husband', 'Leonard', 'are', 'fantastic', 'complex', 'film', 'think', 'underlying', 'message', 'phenomenon', 'suicide', 'similar', 'acts', 'seem', 'unconscionable', 'are', 'simply', 'matters', 'choice', 'can', 'take', 'lives', 'leave', 'loved', 'ones', 'etc', 'will', ""n't"", 'anything', 'stop', 'Torment', 'can', 'reach', 'point', 'most', 'deeply', 'felt', 'instincts', 'longer', 'matter', 'us.Not', 'movie', ""'d"", 'necessarily', 'watch', 'again', 'certainly', 'poetic', 'must', 'see']",The Hours
590995,A2FT4AM5JF57SA,B00005JKTI,Jill,"[0, 8]","I liked the intention of this film and, mostly, its style, but not the way the plot was executed.  I absolutely abhor period films which try too hard to be period films, and this was one of them.  The scenes with Virginia Woolf (we'll get back to Nicole Kidman later) and their extremely British actors made me feel like I was getting a bucket of 1920s England dumped over my head, and the scenes set in the 1950s did the same, hitting way too hard with the style and manners of speaking.  The only character I really liked was Virginia Woolf, and I thought Nicole Kidman did a fairly good job of subtley acting the part.  I have no idea what happened with Meryl Streep.  Her acting was way overdone.  No one actually talks like that except in a stage play.But besides these obvious surface issues, this film seems to be an almost misogynist look at three women craving the affection of other women plus a man who most likely contacted AIDS from homosexual sex, although we're never told the whole story.  I didn't particularly enjoy this portrayal of women.  I also thought many elements of the story were implausible, although if you take it as a sort of avant-garde thing it works, as when Richard says that he wanted to write a book where everything comes together but in a different way, or something along those lines.  Well, the film nearly succeeded in doing that, I must say.  I enjoyed the final few scenes, but only because they spoke to the inner chick-flick lover buried deep inside me which I don't like to enjoy admitting exists.  I think the ending was a bit too overdramatic as well but it works for this kind of film.  Overall, I would say I liked Virginia Woolf, sometimes cared about Laura, and couldn't stand most of the scenes about Clarissa.  I liked how Virginia described herself wrestling with her demons in the dark.

Like Cunningham's book, the film spins all three stories simultaneously, pointing out the similarities and differences between each of the women's lives; and then finally ties all three threads together in a spectacularly clever and thought-provoking twist that reveals the larger pattern of the plot (some audiences members in the theatre where I saw the film actually gasped aloud as they began to understand).As befits such a character-driven film, the acting in ""The Hours"" is uniformly superb.  Meryl Streep is luminous throughout as Clarissa, but particularly shines in her final scenes as she welcomes a stranger into her home; and Julianne Moore brings a fascinating combination of fragility and power to the role of the repressed Laura.  Toni Collette infuses her short scenes as Laura's friend and neighbor Kitty with a marvelous counterpoint to Moore's quiet introspection; Miranda Richardson is restrained Victorian perfection as Virginia Woolf's demure sister; and Ed Harris is achingly brilliant in the small but showy role of Clarissa's dying friend.Among this handful of flawless characterizations, it is Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf who nonetheless stands out.  She completely disappears into her role; although much comment has been made about Kidman's prosthetic nose and the way it completely changes her appearance, it is not makeup alone which transforms the vivacious actress into the dowdy authoress.  Kidman uses her mouth and eyes with incredible economy: her bowed lips move without disturbing her pale, translucent cheeks; and her downturned, darting eyes communicate eloquently her character's sense of uneasy restlessness.  Kidman's Virginia seems uncomfortable in her tall body, and her voice is dangerously strained.  It's a transcendent performance, and one with which Kidman solidifies her growing reputation as one of her generation's most talented screen actresses.The film is beautifully photographed in dark, muted hues; the sets appear just as they were described in Cunningham's hauntingly visual novel.  While Philip Glass's score is at times a bit obtrusive, it nonetheless contibutes effectively to the atmosphere of the film.  The most stunning technical achievement of the film is the wonderful costume design; clothing styles and fabrics have been painstakingly planned and executed, providing some subtle foreshadowing and highlighting of important themes and motifs thoughout the narrative.  Costumer Ann Roth should definitely find herself in the running for an Oscar, as should Streep, Moore, Kidman, Harris, director Stephen Daldry, film editor Peter Boyle, and of course, the Picture itself.  Altogether, ""The Hours"" is an outstanding film that provides an extraordinary cast ample and unique opportunities to shine, especially its formidable trio of leading ladies.",5,"A Remarkable Cast in Their Finest ""Hours""",1042761600,"01 17, 2003",2003,3628,"['intelligent', 'lyrical', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'exquisite', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize-winning', 'novel', 'ways', 'person', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'drastically', 'altered', 'course', 'seemingly', 'normal', 'day', 'story', 'cuts', 'back', 'forth', 'three', 'women', 'stories', '1923', 'novelist', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'writing', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'recuperating', 'mental', 'breakdown', '1950', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'housewife', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'reading', 'Woolf', 'book', 'feeling', 'growing', 'sense', 'desperation', 'bland', 'suburban', 'existence', '2001', 'New', 'York', 'middle-aged', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'planning', 'party', 'honor', 'dying', 'friend', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'who', 'referred', 'nickname', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'youthful', 'affair', 'many', 'years', 'previously', 'Cunningham', 'book', 'film', 'three', 'stories', 'simultaneously', 'pointing', 'out', 'similarities', 'differences', 'women', 'lives', 'then', 'finally', 'three', 'threads', 'together', 'spectacularly', 'clever', 'thought-provoking', 'twist', 'larger', 'pattern', 'plot', 'audiences', 'members', 'theatre', 'where', 'saw', 'film', 'actually', 'gasped', 'aloud', 'began', 'understand', '.As', 'befits', 'such', 'character-driven', 'film', 'acting', 'Hours', 'uniformly', 'superb', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'luminous', 'Clarissa', 'particularly', 'shines', 'final', 'scenes', 'stranger', 'home', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'fascinating', 'combination', 'fragility', 'power', 'role', 'repressed', 'Laura', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'short', 'scenes', 'Laura', 'friend', 'neighbor', 'Kitty', 'marvelous', 'counterpoint', 'Moore', 'quiet', 'introspection', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'restrained', 'Victorian', 'perfection', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'demure', 'sister', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'achingly', 'brilliant', 'small', 'showy', 'role', 'Clarissa', 'dying', 'friend.Among', 'handful', 'flawless', 'characterizations', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'who', 'nonetheless', 'out', 'completely', 'role', 'much', 'comment', 'been', 'made', 'Kidman', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'way', 'completely', 'appearance', 'not', 'makeup', 'alone', 'vivacious', 'actress', 'dowdy', 'authoress', 'Kidman', 'mouth', 'eyes', 'incredible', 'economy', 'bowed', 'lips', 'move', 'disturbing', 'pale', 'translucent', 'cheeks', 'downturned', 'darting', 'eyes', 'communicate', 'eloquently', 'character', 'sense', 'uneasy', 'restlessness', 'Kidman', 'Virginia', 'uncomfortable', 'tall', 'body', 'voice', 'dangerously', 'strained', 'transcendent', 'performance', 'one', 'Kidman', 'growing', 'reputation', 'one', 'generation', 'most', 'talented', 'screen', 'actresses.The', 'film', 'beautifully', 'photographed', 'dark', 'muted', 'hues', 'sets', 'appear', 'just', 'were', 'described', 'Cunningham', 'hauntingly', 'visual', 'novel', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'score', 'times', 'bit', 'obtrusive', 'nonetheless', 'effectively', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'most', 'stunning', 'technical', 'achievement', 'film', 'wonderful', 'costume', 'design', 'clothing', 'styles', 'fabrics', 'have', 'been', 'painstakingly', 'planned', 'executed', 'providing', 'subtle', 'foreshadowing', 'highlighting', 'important', 'themes', 'motifs', 'narrative', 'Costumer', 'Ann', 'Roth', 'should', 'definitely', 'find', 'running', 'Oscar', 'should', 'Streep', 'Moore', 'Kidman', 'Harris', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'film', 'editor', 'Peter', 'Boyle', 'course', 'Picture', 'Altogether', 'Hours', 'outstanding', 'film', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'ample', 'unique', 'opportunities', 'shine', 'especially', 'formidable', 'trio', 'leading', 'ladies']",The Hours
590998,A3FGIDFZA4U3O2,B00005JKTI,"Joan Crawford ""Jon""","[3, 5]","Reading the reviews here on Amazon, it seems there are many people who feel The Hours was hypnotic, moving, and intelligent. There are also numerous reviewers who felt that the film was overwhelmingly depressing, self-important, and ultimately dull. Both of the above statements are true!First, let me say there is rarely a masterpiece created that isn't self-important. A visionary knows when he creates a masterpiece, knows going into the project that he is creating something that speaks of truth. It doesn't use irony or any kind of sideline, but hits the audience with truth head-on.The first time I saw The Hours in theaters, I was dreadfully disappointed!  I thought it was pompous and pointless! It was only as I began to remember subtle details, scenes, and emotions from the film that I came to respect its greatness--the greatness of Kidman's wistful gazes and forceful intensity.. The pain and humility and wisdom conveyed in her voice and every gesture.  There is a line in the film, when Woolf (Kidman) is asked by her husband, who must die (in her novel). Woolf replies, &quot;the visionary must die.&quot; I think that is the message of The Hours, but it took me a long time to discover it.All three women in the film could represent visionaries, but there are forces suppressing them. Moore is trapped in a marriage to a man she does not love (and does not fulfill her needs), Kidman seems to be the intelligent and romantic dreamer surrounded by people who can only see the superficial qualities of life (only the young girl can see the depth inherent in her, and the significance that Kidman finds in the dead bird).The film is flawed. The segment with Meryl Streep seems to drag, uninspired and depressing. Her performance is a weak link in a film that has two fully realized characters played by two of our best actresses today (Moore and Kidman). It is the compelling combination of brilliant performances, a haunting score, and masterful writing that gives the film its unique and lasting impact.And to address those who feel Kidman only won the Academy Award for her deglamorized appearance, perhaps they should see the film again and look at the meaning Kidman conveys in every gesture, word, and soulful gaze.",4,A truthful film.,1079740800,"03 20, 2004",2004,2235,"['Reading', 'reviews', 'here', 'Amazon', 'are', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'feel', 'Hours', 'was', 'hypnotic', 'moving', 'intelligent', 'are', 'also', 'numerous', 'reviewers', 'who', 'felt', 'film', 'was', 'overwhelmingly', 'depressing', 'self-important', 'ultimately', 'dull', 'above', 'statements', 'are', 'true', 'First', 'let', 'say', 'rarely', 'masterpiece', 'created', ""n't"", 'self-important', 'visionary', 'knows', 'when', 'masterpiece', 'going', 'project', 'creating', 'something', 'truth', ""n't"", 'use', 'irony', 'kind', 'sideline', 'audience', 'truth', 'head-on.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'Hours', 'theaters', 'was', 'dreadfully', 'disappointed', 'thought', 'was', 'pompous', 'pointless', 'was', 'only', 'began', 'remember', 'subtle', 'details', 'scenes', 'emotions', 'film', 'came', 'respect', 'greatness', 'greatness', 'Kidman', 'wistful', 'gazes', 'forceful', 'intensity..', 'pain', 'humility', 'wisdom', 'conveyed', 'voice', 'gesture', 'line', 'film', 'when', 'Woolf', 'Kidman', 'asked', 'husband', 'who', 'must', 'die', 'novel', 'Woolf', 'replies', 'quot', 'visionary', 'must', 'die.', 'quot', 'think', 'message', 'Hours', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'discover', 'it.All', 'three', 'women', 'film', 'could', 'represent', 'visionaries', 'are', 'forces', 'suppressing', 'Moore', 'trapped', 'marriage', 'man', 'not', 'love', 'not', 'fulfill', 'needs', 'Kidman', 'be', 'intelligent', 'romantic', 'dreamer', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'only', 'see', 'superficial', 'qualities', 'life', 'only', 'young', 'girl', 'can', 'see', 'depth', 'inherent', 'significance', 'Kidman', 'dead', 'bird', '.The', 'film', 'flawed', 'segment', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'drag', 'uninspired', 'depressing', 'performance', 'weak', 'link', 'film', 'two', 'fully', 'realized', 'characters', 'played', 'two', 'best', 'actresses', 'today', 'Moore', 'Kidman', 'compelling', 'combination', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'haunting', 'score', 'masterful', 'writing', 'film', 'unique', 'lasting', 'impact.And', 'address', 'who', 'feel', 'Kidman', 'only', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'deglamorized', 'appearance', 'perhaps', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'again', 'look', 'meaning', 'Kidman', 'conveys', 'gesture', 'word', 'soulful', 'gaze']",The Hours
590999,A3KUUII2GSHN7T,B00005JKTI,"Joel Munyon ""Joel Munyon""","[5, 13]","The closing lines of this film are a quote from Virginia Woolf where she wrote, ""To look life in the face, always, to look life in the face, and to know it for what it is.....at last, to love it for what it is, and then to put it away.""Well, our three principle characters do look life in the face, including Woolf, but where exactly do they ""love it?"" What I saw were three women who lived desperate, obligatory lives, and who did so with a thinnest of success. One failed entirely, and one loved life - or in her case, ""chose life"" - by abandoning her world, and, most notably, her children.My original response to this film, a movie depicting the lives of three women who must all face suicide and delve in their own personal masquerades as well as mental illnesses, was that I was somehow swept up in awe of it all. The acting was solid, the cast extraordinary, and the music was sweeping. But then I asked myself, ""So what?"" I believe the film is guilty of two things.#1. It contradicts its point. Loving life does not equate running from it. I found the women tolerating life at best, and certainly were not adhering to Woolf's famous quote on the nature of living and loving doing so.#2. It takes itself far too seriously. Perhaps this was the impression that Glass' score had on me when mixed with certain scenes. I can't be totally certain. But I do know that the point the film was trying to make is lost in some of the contrived themes in the film.This film is not a total failure. Far from it, in fact. There are moments of delicacy and superb acting that are hard to find these days; however, the point of the film is largely lost by the contradictory philosophies stemming largely from Woolf herself. I also think Glass' music helped overcome many of the otherwise self-important elements. To seperate the music from this film would probably change many minds about its quality.Just my opinion.

591000,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,B00005JKTI,Joe Sherry,"[6, 11]","A Film By Stephen DaldryThe Hours is based on the Pulitzer Prize Winning novel by Michael Cunningham.  The movie stars Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep.  It was nominated for 9 Academy Awards and Nicole Kidman won for Best Actress.  Also nominated were Julianne Moore and Ed Harris for their supporting roles.  It was nominated for Best Picture and Best Director.  This is a film with a high class pedigree.This film follows three women in three different time periods.  In the end, The Hours is really telling just one story and each of the time periods contributes to it.  We have Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1923 England, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951 California, and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) in 2001 New York.  The film does not have a story so much as it deals with issues revolving around the lives of these women: depression, suicide, death, and family.  The Hours does so in a way that is deeply personal but never pushes any viewpoint down the viewer's throat.Virginia Woolf is dealing with her personal issues of mental isolation as she writes Mrs. Dalloway.  She deals with depression and a desire to die to silence the voices in her head.  Laura Brown is a housewife who has to deal with a faltering relationship with her husband and she feels a kinship with the character of Mrs Dalloway in Woolf's novel (which she is reading).  Clarissa Vaughn is living in New York City, and it seems that she is living the life of Mrs Dalloway.  The movie features supporting performances by John C Reilly, Ed Harris, Claire Danes, Alison Janney, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, and Stephen Dillane.This is the type of film that is made for the Academy Awards but really only has a specialized audience outside the Award circuit.  Critics love The Hours, but it is a slow moving drama and this will not appeal to everyone.  It is extremely well done, make no mistake about that, but this is not the movie to go to if you are looking for escapism.  This is the movie to go to when you are looking to think critically about the film and what it is saying about the human condition.",4,not for everyone,1059609600,"07 31, 2003",2003,2115,"['Film', 'Stephen', 'DaldryThe', 'Hours', 'based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Winning', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'movie', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'was', 'nominated', '9', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'won', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Also', 'nominated', 'were', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'supporting', 'roles', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Best', 'Director', 'film', 'high', 'class', 'pedigree.This', 'film', 'three', 'women', 'three', 'different', 'time', 'periods', 'end', 'Hours', 'really', 'telling', 'just', 'one', 'story', 'time', 'periods', 'have', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', '1923', 'England', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Julianne', 'Moore', '1951', 'California', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'Meryl', 'Streep', '2001', 'New', 'York', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'story', 'so', 'much', 'issues', 'revolving', 'lives', 'women', 'depression', 'suicide', 'death', 'family', 'Hours', 'so', 'way', 'deeply', 'personal', 'never', 'viewpoint', 'down', 'viewer', 'throat.Virginia', 'Woolf', 'dealing', 'personal', 'issues', 'mental', 'isolation', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'depression', 'desire', 'die', 'silence', 'voices', 'head', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'housewife', 'who', 'deal', 'faltering', 'relationship', 'husband', 'kinship', 'character', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'Woolf', 'novel', 'reading', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'living', 'life', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'movie', 'supporting', 'performances', 'John', 'C', 'Reilly', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Alison', 'Janney', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Stephen', 'Dillane.This', 'type', 'film', 'made', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'really', 'only', 'specialized', 'audience', 'Award', 'circuit', 'Critics', 'love', 'Hours', 'slow', 'moving', 'drama', 'will', 'not', 'appeal', 'everyone', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'make', 'mistake', 'not', 'movie', 'go', 'are', 'looking', 'escapism', 'movie', 'go', 'when', 'are', 'looking', 'think', 'critically', 'film', 'what', 'saying', 'human', 'condition']",The Hours

All the characters are so uninteresting that you want them to die within the first 10 minutes just so something exciting will happen.

Kudos to Nicole Kidman for her Best Actress Oscar! The screenwriting, on the other hand, left this viewer feeling like someone who ate good side dishes but was never provided the main course.I agree that the director successfully interwove the lives of three women from dissimilar time periods to create three situationally identical stories in one feature. On the down side, watching The Hours had me observing predominant emotions whose origins were scantily put forth. For instance, Virginia Woolf was looking for new avenues of adventure and exploration; that's the easy part. Why she was driven to her points of despair I really could not determine. That is, were her depression and search for independence and, eventually, suicide, unfortunate byproducts of a woman who was living in the wrong place at the wrong time, or (and I don't mean to be ugly about this) were they the inevitable outcomes of someone who had too much time on her hands?Again, much attention was paid to the inner struggles, but the causes of them were not really put forth, because it was not revealed to what degree each character interacted with society. So you could not tell if their psychological adversities were struggles from without (Was society that bad for each?) or developments that came from within (changes that might come with age or declining health), or both.For those who may feel clueless after watching The Hours, it might be because the film, itself, was cueless.",3,Good Acting but Seemingly Selfish Lead Characters,1060214400,"08 7, 2003",2003,1584,"['Hours', 'was', 'okay', 'movie', 'outstanding', 'performances', 'can', 'say', 'strongest', 'attribute', 'release', 'Kudos', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'screenwriting', 'other', 'hand', 'left', 'viewer', 'feeling', 'someone', 'who', 'ate', 'good', 'side', 'dishes', 'was', 'never', 'provided', 'main', 'course.I', 'agree', 'director', 'successfully', 'interwove', 'lives', 'three', 'women', 'dissimilar', 'time', 'periods', 'create', 'three', 'situationally', 'identical', 'stories', 'one', 'feature', 'down', 'side', 'watching', 'Hours', 'had', 'observing', 'predominant', 'emotions', 'origins', 'were', 'scantily', 'put', 'forth', 'instance', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'was', 'looking', 'new', 'avenues', 'adventure', 'exploration', 'easy', 'part', 'Why', 'was', 'driven', 'points', 'despair', 'really', 'could', 'not', 'determine', 'were', 'depression', 'search', 'independence', 'eventually', 'suicide', 'unfortunate', 'byproducts', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'living', 'wrong', 'place', 'wrong', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'be', 'ugly', 'were', 'inevitable', 'outcomes', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'Again', 'much', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'inner', 'struggles', 'causes', 'were', 'not', 'really', 'put', 'forth', 'was', 'not', 'revealed', 'what', 'degree', 'character', 'interacted', 'society', 'could', 'not', 'tell', 'psychological', 'adversities', 'were', 'struggles', 'Was', 'society', 'bad', 'developments', 'came', 'changes', 'might', 'come', 'age', 'declining', 'health', 'both.For', 'who', 'may', 'feel', 'clueless', 'watching', 'Hours', 'might', 'be', 'film', 'was', 'cueless']",The Hours
591008,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JKTI,Joseph Haschka,"[0, 2]","During the first couple minutes of THE HOURS, it's 1941 and author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) commits suicide by walking into a river. That pretty much sets the tone of the film as a whole.The body of the film skips back and forth among three timelines.In 1923, Woolf is forced by physicians and her husband (Stephen Dillane) to live away from the center of London in a dreary suburb after two suicide attempts. The author resents her isolation, and tells her spouse that peace is not found by being shielded from the world at large. Virginia expresses her frustration by writing a book, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", in which the protagonist, while preparing for a dinner party, is confronted by events that raise into consciousness the shallowness and inadequacies of her life.In 1951, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), living in a Los Angeles middle-class housing tract with loving husband Dan (John C. Reilly) and young son, is reading ""Mrs. Dalloway"". Contemplating her lack of fulfillment in the roles of wife and mother, Laura bakes her husband's birthday cake, plans his party, and considers suicide.In 2001 New York, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) lives with her same-sex partner, while at the same time caring for ex-husband Richard (Ed Harris), who's dying of AIDS in a dark and cluttered flat. Richard is an award-winning poet, and Clarissa (nicknamed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her Richard) is planning a dinner party in honor of his accomplishments.THE HOURS is a complex film, the heroines of its three subplots all linked by the threads of self-destruction, ""Mrs. Dalloway"", and the extreme emotional and psychological dissatisfaction each feels in the relationship with the man in her life. Clarissa is already in a lesbian liaison, and there are strong hints that the other two would welcome such. The performances of the four principle actors (Kidman, Moore, Streep, and Harris) are all of Oscar caliber.There are perhaps as many messages to be gotten from THE HOURS as there are people who will view it. I perceived the velvet chains that bind two people in a relationship. (""That's what we do. We stay alive for one another"". - Clarissa) Chains that may drive one to an exit of desperation if there's an absence of love, or the feeling of one's own self being smothered and not having a little patch of ground to call one's own. And the guilt we feel when those chains are broken, if even to the long-term advantage of self.This is a splendid and brilliantly conceived film that deserves all the honors it will reap. The connection between the 1951 and 2001 timelines was cleverly done. But, for me, THE HOURS had one great flaw. It failed to establish any emotional attachment between the main characters and myself. Virginia was too sour, Laura too distant, and Clarissa too self-absorbed.

Directed with skill by Stephen Daldry, the film moves fluidly from one time to another, helped along with an exhilarating score by Philip Glass. It also is a showcase for actors, several of whom give the finest performances of their careers.As a profound meditation on suicide, ""The Hours"" is not always easy viewing. But it is also a film about the value of life and the choices we make as we go through it. It tells the story of three women who are connected through different eras. In 1923, Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) fights her inner demons while writing the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway."" Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a wife and mother in 1950's Los Angeles who reads ""Mrs. Dalloway"" while contemplating taking her own life. Finally in 2001 New York City, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) hides from her emotions while planning a party fer her dying friend (Ed Harris), much like the character of Mrs. Dalloway.This summary may seem incredibly boring, but the movie is not. The three stories flow seamlessly in with one another, and there are a thousand tiny moments that take your breath away. The acting is a large part of the film's success. Nicole Kidman is a revelation as the tortured Virginia Woolf, and richly deserved the Best Actress Oscar that she won. Kidman disappears so completely into the character that she is nearly unrecognizable, and there is a ferocious intensity that radiates from her every glance and inflection. I'll be surprised if Nicole Kidman ever tops this performance, it's astonishing. Meryl Streep gives what is probably her best work since ""Sophie's Choice"" in 1982. Her Clarissa has tried to bury herself in work to keep from remembering that she isn't happy with her life, and Streep's scenes with Ed Harris as Richard, a poet dying of AIDS, are master classes in great acting. Julianne Moore is also haunting as Laura Brown, a housewife who is drowning in depression. In the scene where Moore leaves her son, her face quickly disintegrates into tears. It's incredible work.Besides the three main stars, the entire cast is uniformly excellent, even in smaller roles. Ed Harris, Allison Janney, Toni Collette, John. C. Reilly, Miranda Richardson, Stephen Dillane, Claire Danes, and Eileen Atkins all are outstanding. The only exception is Jeff Bridges, who seems to think that playing a gay man means adopting a lisp and a girlish giggle.""The Hours"" is a film that will make you think, and that requires more than one viewing to catch all of its subtleties. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

It is a movie about the lives of 3 women, their depression, their choices.Nicole Kidman is convincing as the silently tortured bi-polar Virginia Wolfe who desperately wants to be normal for the sake of everyone around her, but because of her untreated illness, cannot.  Juliann Moore is the most heart-wrenching as the mother who desperately wants to be a good mother and wife but because she is so emotionally dettached and unfulfilled in those roles, she cannot.  Merle Streep is the lesbian who plays nurse-maid to her male ex-lover now dying of AIDS.  She wants to rescue him.  She cannot.Three actresses playing the roles of three women who are unsuccessfully playing roles and whose characters ultimately fail miserably.  Their lives are poignant: brutally so.The poet/author, Virginia Wolfe, devoid of all hope that she can ever overcome her violent mood swings and exhausted from trying, wades into the river and drowns herself.  This is the only way she believes she can save(or free) herself and those she loves.  Juliann Moore's character commits the unthinkable act of abandoning her young son who worships her.  In her mind she is saving (or freeing) herself and those she loves. Merle Streep's character assumes the ever-busy role of ""Mrs. Dalloway""  (the character from Virginia Wolfe's famous novel).  She desperately  attempts to distract her dying ex-lover who tragically wants to die more than anything because he never could get over the crippling truth that the mother he worshipped abandoned him.Three hurting women, much loved, who abandon those who love them.  This is a sad movie.  It is not a movie made for entertainment as much for philosophical value.  It is deep and thought provoking.  If you are not accustomed to such films or have an aversion to same, this movie is not for you.  As for me, I believe this movie is one of the greatest of all time.

591011,A2NBOL825B93OM,B00005JKTI,J R Zullo,"[2, 5]","The viewer has to prepare himself before watching ""The hours"". This is not a common movie. It's a deep, sad, and very depressive movie.There are three timelines in ""The hours"", and director Daldry chose to show them simultaneously; all stories are about one day in the lives of three women. I'll list the three timelines:1) England, 1923 - Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway; she receives the visit of her sister; she tries to set her life straight, as she's not living the life she wanted, because of medical and psychological problems.2) California, 1950 - Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a little son; this is the day of her husband's (john C. Reilly) birthday; she's reading Mrs. Dalloway; she has doubts about everything, from her sexuality to her will to go on living.3) New York, 2001 - Clarissa Vaughn's (Meryl Streep) day is about organizing a party to her friend and ex-one time-lover, the poet and writer Richard (Ed Harris), who is receiving an important prize of lifetime achievment in poetry.The three stories are connected; the most obvious connection is that Clarissa Vaughn is the modern Mrs. Dalloway. There are recurrent themes in the three stories, all related to Mrs. Dalloway and Virginia Woolf's life: sexual doubts, depressive thoughts, death wishes. Stephen Daldry made a movie more complex than he wanted, without knowing he did it. Uncounsciously, ""The hours"" is deeper and denser than its director wanted it to be. You have to get a degree in psychology to fully understand all the relationship between the women characters.Although ""The hours"" is starred by women, a movie about women, with three of today's top actresses, their constant presence and the fact that the three of them are so sad, depressive and unresolved characters, makes the male actors' (Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly and Ed Harris) acting excellent. The best one in my opinion is Stephen Dillane's Leonard Woolf.Two things I didn't like:A) Meryl Streep lost herself here; her acting seemed a little bit forced and self-conscious, trying to make Clarissa a different character from other characters she's played in other movies: she couldn't do it. I've seen this same Clarissa in other Meryl Streep movies (Meryl Streep is much better in ""Adaptation"").B) Nicole Kidman, although in good acting shape, played a character (Virginia Woolf) so sad and depressive that I couldn't care one bit what happened to her. I think the writers exagerated Virginia's depression to make the audience understand better what happened to her, but this trick completely backfired. No one can stand Virgina Woolf in the movie. And the scene with the dead bird is the oldest metaphore ever.Without any doubt, the real star of the movie is Julianne Moore.

591020,A1V1DI17ZJRUPM,B00005JKTI,Lady_C,"[3, 6]","Each day is connected through hours of momentums; and our non-stop thinking ushers our play. Writing-and-reading becomes an emblem to bridge these 3 women from time and space, and the story runs through a stream of their consciousness in a time warp, and a character twist (addendum).There are 3 middle-aged women: Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) in 1928, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in 1951, and Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) in 2001. They each encounter stress in life, and what is hidden is an emergence of independence as we follow the characters' lives through progressive eras.A culmination of this film is several kissing scenes: Virginia and her sister Vanessa, Laura and her neighbor, Clarissa and Richard. The kissing, different from a sensual affection, expresses outwardly how the compassion and the appreciation are released from the one who is going through a mind-remodeling. These scenes are suppressing and passionate at the same time.I cannot argue that this film is a tad dark and tense to an emotional sense, but a good drama with layers.Life in part is like the flowers Clarissa uses to celebrate the party. It conveys a sense of transient beauty; time peters out, we each live in hours, critical moments of life and try to enjoy with a content from the very bottom of all our senses and decisions.Addendum:The story links 3 women who are related to Woolf's novel, even including Woolf herself.Virginia Woolf was engaging a novel ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which was read later by Laura Brown, a mother who eagers freedom herself. Clarissa resembles a modern variation of Mrs. Dalloway is a lesbian plans a party for her ex-lover-and-AIDS-poet, Richard.Virginia and her illness can relate to Richard and his AIDS. Laura shares a character combination of Clarissa and Virginia, both strong and weak.

591021,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00005JKTI,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 4]","I went into the Oscars this year only having strong feelings about Conrad Hall and Thomas Newman for ""Road to Perdition"" in the categories of Cinematography and Original Score respectively and ended up one for two (Hall won his final Oscar posthumously but Newman lost out to Elliot Goldenthal for ""Frieda"").  However, I know want to be retroactively be outraged that David Hare did not pick up the little golden dude for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published for the seamless way in which he weaved together the three stories of three women in three different times and places that make up ""The Hours.""  By the point in the opening credits when Nicole Kidman's Virginia Woolf and Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughan both put up their hair for the day sixty years apart while in a time in between Julianne Moore's Laura Brown picks up the copy of ""Mrs. Dalloway"" that she is reading, the conceit is firmly established in our mind.Granted, I may well find this particularly effective because I have consumed more than my fair share of twisted time travel tales, so unconventional narrative form violating rules of time and space (American montage from start to finish) does not inherently confuse me.  Instead, I found ""The Hours"" (the working title of Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"") to be intellectually engaging.  Hare is presenting the stories in Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize winning novel as parts of a puzzle.  Laura Brown feels that Woolf's novel is speaking to her on a deep and personal level, reading in it an impulse towards suicide; after all, Woolf ended her life by loading stones into her coat and drowning herself in the river outside her Sussex home.  But Hare's screenplay has Woolf reconsidering the ending to her novel and the question of which character should be fated to die, and that shift in thinking resonates through the years to Brown's situation.  The parallels with Clarissa Vaughan are decidedly different as she ministers to her ex-husband Richard (Ed Harris), a poet of intense bitterness dying of AIDS, and who insists on calling her ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  Not only does she share the same first name as Woolf's character, this Clarissa is also preparing to host a party, as is Brown.  The parties are quite different, but each character examines their life in light of preparing for the event.  Of course one party will happen and the other will not, but these divergent paths will ultimately unite as the narratives finally come together.The performances in ""The Hours"" are as stellar as the cast, which is certainly not surprising.  I found myself thinking that they should not have listed the cast in the opening credits because as the list of names goes by after the big three (Ed Harris, Stephen Dillane, Miranda Richardson, Toni Collette, Allison Janney,  Jeff Daniels, Claire Danes and John C. Reilly, who only managed to be in three of the five Oscar nominated films for Best Picture) is sort of distracts you from the way the film is setting the stage for the drama (compare with the way ""Playing by Heart"" introduces us to an equally stellar cast).  The DVD offers two superb commentary tracks, the first featuring actresses Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep doing tag team commentaries on their scenes, while the second offers screenwriter Hare and director Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot"").  They offer insights into how this finely crafted jewel of a film came into being.  You should make a point of sitting through both of those before you even bother going to the bonus disc.  In the final analysis, perhaps the greatest ironic truth of this film that is adapted from one novel which was inspired a classic novel is that it is such a literate film.",5,Three women discover that they have lost their lives,1056844800,"06 29, 2003",2003,3740,"['went', 'Oscars', 'year', 'only', 'having', 'strong', 'feelings', 'Conrad', 'Hall', 'Thomas', 'Newman', 'Road', 'Perdition', 'categories', 'Cinematography', 'Original', 'Score', 'respectively', 'ended', 'up', 'one', 'two', 'Hall', 'won', 'final', 'Oscar', 'posthumously', 'Newman', 'lost', 'out', 'Elliot', 'Goldenthal', 'Frieda', 'However', 'know', 'want', 'be', 'retroactively', 'be', 'outraged', 'David', 'Hare', 'did', 'not', 'pick', 'up', 'little', 'golden', 'dude', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Screenplay', 'Based', 'Material', 'Previously', 'Produced', 'Published', 'seamless', 'way', 'weaved', 'together', 'three', 'stories', 'three', 'women', 'three', 'different', 'times', 'places', 'make', 'up', 'Hours', 'point', 'opening', 'credits', 'when', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'put', 'up', 'hair', 'day', 'years', 'apart', 'time', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'up', 'copy', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'reading', 'conceit', 'firmly', 'established', 'mind.Granted', 'may', 'well', 'find', 'particularly', 'effective', 'have', 'consumed', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'twisted', 'time', 'travel', 'tales', 'unconventional', 'narrative', 'form', 'violating', 'rules', 'time', 'space', 'American', 'montage', 'start', 'finish', 'not', 'inherently', 'confuse', 'Instead', 'found', 'Hours', 'working', 'title', 'Woolf', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'be', 'intellectually', 'engaging', 'Hare', 'presenting', 'stories', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'parts', 'puzzle', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'feels', 'Woolf', 'novel', 'speaking', 'deep', 'personal', 'level', 'reading', 'impulse', 'towards', 'suicide', 'Woolf', 'ended', 'life', 'loading', 'stones', 'coat', 'drowning', 'river', 'Sussex', 'home', 'Hare', 'screenplay', 'Woolf', 'reconsidering', 'ending', 'novel', 'question', 'character', 'should', 'be', 'fated', 'die', 'shift', 'thinking', 'resonates', 'years', 'Brown', 'situation', 'parallels', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'are', 'decidedly', 'different', 'ex-husband', 'Richard', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'poet', 'intense', 'bitterness', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'who', 'calling', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'Not', 'only', 'share', 'same', 'first', 'name', 'Woolf', 'character', 'Clarissa', 'also', 'preparing', 'host', 'party', 'Brown', 'parties', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'character', 'examines', 'life', 'light', 'preparing', 'event', 'course', 'one', 'party', 'will', 'happen', 'other', 'will', 'not', 'divergent', 'paths', 'will', 'ultimately', 'unite', 'narratives', 'finally', 'come', 'together.The', 'performances', 'Hours', 'are', 'as', 'stellar', 'cast', 'certainly', 'not', 'surprising', 'found', 'thinking', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'listed', 'cast', 'opening', 'credits', 'list', 'names', 'big', 'three', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'only', 'managed', 'be', 'three', 'five', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'films', 'Best', 'Picture', 'sort', 'distracts', 'way', 'film', 'setting', 'stage', 'drama', 'compare', 'way', 'Playing', 'Heart', 'equally', 'stellar', 'cast', 'DVD', 'two', 'superb', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'first', 'featuring', 'actresses', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'doing', 'tag', 'team', 'commentaries', 'scenes', 'second', 'offers', 'screenwriter', 'Hare', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'offer', 'insights', 'how', 'finely', 'crafted', 'jewel', 'film', 'came', 'being', 'should', 'make', 'point', 'sitting', 'even', 'bother', 'going', 'bonus', 'disc', 'final', 'analysis', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'ironic', 'truth', 'film', 'adapted', 'one', 'novel', 'was', 'inspired', 'classic', 'novel', 'such', 'literate', 'film']",The Hours

Disturbing, not hopeless. Sometimes it feels like a stage play shot with a mobile camera and other times is more cinematic.

But yet, in some way, all are linked to the Virginia Woolf novel, ""Mrs. Dalloway"".  Each woman wakes up one morning with the anticipation of some sort of party.  There's Virginia Woolf herself in 1923, whose creativity as well as mental illness is apparent.  She's frustrated at her forced seclusion from the London she loves and is making time for her sister's visit.  There's Clarissa Vaughn, a middle-aged New York woman who is having a party for a good friend and former lover who is dying of AIDS.  And there's Julianne Moore as Laura Brown, a 1951 housewife who is planning on baking a cake for her husband's birthday.  Michael Cunningham linked all this together in the small masterpiece of a novel.  And the screenwriter, David Hare did nothing less than a brilliant job in adapting it to the screen.  I just finished reading the book and so I was particularly sensitive to the small changes, such as eliminating some of the minor characters.  But the rather introspective and sad tone of the book is still there.  And the characters spring to life in the kind of performances that will surely garner them all academy award nominations.Nicole Kidman is cast as Virginia Woolf.  I was surprised at that because I think of her as a glamour queen.  However, for this role she wears a prosthetic nose, and her makeup gives her a sallow appearance.  She comes across as dowdy and homely and slightly insane.  And her acting is so good that I thought I was seeing the actual Virginia Woolf on the screen.  Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn.  She's living with her own set of life regrets.  There's sadness beneath her veneer of the perfect hostess planning a party, and it's not a surprise when she lets it come out.  And then there is Julianne Moore cast as Laura Brown, all alone in her despondency even though she seems to have a perfect life.  Ed Harris is cast as the AIDS patient who is also going mad.  They, and the rest of the cast are some of the best actors in the business, and it really shows.The cinematography and sets are also outstanding and the shifts between the three stories are seamless.  There will be a gesture in one scene that is picked up in the next and this kind of overlapping editing keeps the story flowing.  There's a theme of suicide throughout.  And bisexuality.  Mostly, though its about the our need for love and the choices we make about how to spend our hours.  Much of the story is painful.  But yet, its theme is universal.

I did not know what to expect when I saw The Hours.  I had not read the novel, because I do not usually read any contemporary fiction.  Perhaps the planets were aligned in some such way, but I was completely floored by The Hours!  There are so many layers, you could keep peeling and peeling and dissecting for a very long time.  And, if you enjoy that sort of thing, then it is right up your alley.  If you don't enjoy introspection, and symbolism, and the study of the human experience, then you will be bored to tears!  I happen to love that sort of thing.  Asking questions - - why am I here, who am I, what does it all mean - - and questioning my roles - - wife, mother, friend, daughter, sister, employee, volunteer, female extraordinaire! - - and wondering `What If?' every now and then...  In The Hours, though, the layers are thick and heavy, so expect to work.  And if you are prone to depression, this could possibly bring you lower, although I found it rather satisfying and uplifting by the end of it.  While I personally did not agree with many of the choices made by the characters, they were choices nonetheless, life paths anyone could take, and not without repercussions.As for the performances, every actor was superb.  Nicole Kidman has my full respect as an actress due to this film.  I completely forgot it was Nicole Kidman while I was watching the film.  Julianne Moore was fantastic as the housewife trapped in the 50s, and Meryl Streep managed to excellently portray the modern feminist who is just as scared and trapped inside as the 50s housewife.  The little boy who played Julianne Moore's young son was superb - - he conveyed so much just through his eyes.  Such excellent casting all the way around.  The music was also a huge influence on the film, haunting and repetitive, subtly infusing the atmosphere without being intrusive.  The whole experience was just enthralling!It has been nearly 6 months since I saw The Hours, and I still think about it.  I've now read the novel, and have an even more in-depth feel for what it is all about.

Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore were positively painful to watch in what can only be described as monumentally underachieving performances. I have seen far better stuff on the Lifetime Network.The music was overblown, relentlessly repetitive in its deceitful cadence that is supposedly alerting the audience to some imminent dramatic climax that never happens. Even poor Richard taking the final exit out of his own squalid apartment window was a quiet mercy instead of a thundering tragedy. Did anybody besides me wonder why tireless devoted Clarissa had not taken it upon herself to get a housekeeper for the poor guy, perhaps an aide to help him into the shower.The waste of the talents of Miranda Richardson, Jeff Daniels, and Claire Danes in their trivialized roles really blew me away. Hope these fine actors were paid well to take a disproportionately distant back seat to Nicole, Julianne, and Meryl.I gave this film two stars instead of a mere one because of the hommage paid to Virginia Wolfe in the brilliant performance by Nicole Kidman.

The film is stark in its ability to illustrate the truth and some people may react to the film in negativity. It is about pain, grief, choices on how to live your life or end it if you must. I think the overall emotion the film can reflect is compassion. Compassion for people who are living The Hours as they chose, not judging them, realizing they are we all struggle with pain, that life is not all pain and can be joyful. I was floored at how much this movie tugged at me. I am still reverbrating from it. Kidman, Streep and Moore were all outstanding! They made this movie an inspiration to watch. Notice how well Kidman achieves her accent and voice change. Her mannerisms are impeccable, they are not overdone, she channels her creativity it is so wonderful to watch. Streep is so honest in her acting, she becomes an emotion. Moore is subtle, very subtle and yet so effective! I was amazed at how much Ed Harris does for his roles. He is amazing!

As simple as such a plot may strike you, it is a complex one, but a careful editing labor, a passion for storytelling, some outstanding acting and the music by minimalist maestro Philip Glass serve as the thread between the stories of these three women.Complementing an already outstanding film statement, the make-up and the dialogs ring once and again, with Kidman's face virtually hiding away to bring Woolf's back to life, and when you listen to the lines of all the characters taking on a life of their own, almost moving away from Woolf, away from Cunningham... even away from the very adapter, David Hare, as if told by any of us. Because this is a movie not about trauma, or tragedy, or a sad or sorry existential life of a middle-aged woman (or group of women). This story is about our eternal search for happiness, &quot;the choices we make in that search, and their consequences&quot; as the director, Stephen Daldry, so brilliantly put it.A small bit from the lines of Streep, when talking to her daughter Julie, played by Claire Danes:&quot;It wasn't the beginning... it was happiness. It was the moment, right then!&quot; as if to say, happiness is not a destination, it's the journey that we make every day, while we lead our very ordinary lives, it's in the moments that hide behind the hours, those that we inexorably face. All in all, this movie is now and will be for as long as I can remember it, a classic and a constant reference.Final comment: I don't agree with the comments about another reviewer about the movie being JUST about homosexuality, though there are definite moments where a lesbian side of the characters comes across. If you can't see beyond the fact that some people will just live their lives in a different way than others, and realize that the movie actually does apply to all of us, then you are limiting your life in a very sad way.",5,"A writer, a reader and a character living in The Hours",1065916800,"10 12, 2003",2003,2497,"['fine', 'cast', 'headed', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'England', '1941', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'LA', '1951', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Clarissa', 'NYC', '2001', 'story', 'adapted', 'award-winning', 'book', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'quot', 'Hours', 'quot', 'story', 'lives', 'writer', 'Woolf', 'reader', 'book', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Dallaway', 'quot', 'Laura', 'living', 'LA', 'suburb', 'after-WWII', 'times', 'NY', 'book', 'editor', 'Clarissa', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'ordinary', 'day', 'life', 'getting', 'set', 'party', 'going', 'throw', 'later', 'day', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'poet', 'who', 'just', 'received', 'award', 'As', 'simple', 'such', 'plot', 'may', 'strike', 'complex', 'one', 'careful', 'editing', 'labor', 'passion', 'storytelling', 'outstanding', 'acting', 'music', 'minimalist', 'maestro', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'serve', 'thread', 'stories', 'three', 'women.Complementing', 'already', 'outstanding', 'film', 'statement', 'make-up', 'dialogs', 'ring', 'once', 'again', 'Kidman', 'face', 'virtually', 'hiding', 'away', 'bring', 'Woolf', 'back', 'life', 'when', 'listen', 'lines', 'characters', 'taking', 'life', 'own', 'almost', 'moving', 'away', 'Woolf', 'away', 'Cunningham', 'even', 'away', 'very', 'adapter', 'David', 'Hare', 'told', 'movie', 'not', 'trauma', 'tragedy', 'sad', 'sorry', 'existential', 'life', 'middle-aged', 'woman', 'group', 'women', 'story', 'eternal', 'search', 'happiness', 'quot', 'choices', 'make', 'search', 'consequences', 'quot', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'put', 'it.A', 'small', 'bit', 'lines', 'Streep', 'when', 'talking', 'daughter', 'Julie', 'played', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'quot', 'was', ""n't"", 'beginning', 'was', 'happiness', 'was', 'moment', 'right', 'then', 'quot', 'say', 'happiness', 'not', 'destination', 'journey', 'make', 'day', 'lead', 'very', 'ordinary', 'lives', 'moments', 'hide', 'hours', 'inexorably', 'face', 'movie', 'now', 'will', 'be', 'as', 'long', 'can', 'remember', 'classic', 'constant', 'reference.Final', 'comment', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'comments', 'reviewer', 'movie', 'being', 'JUST', 'homosexuality', 'are', 'definite', 'moments', 'where', 'lesbian', 'side', 'characters', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'fact', 'people', 'will', 'just', 'live', 'lives', 'different', 'way', 'others', 'realize', 'movie', 'actually', 'apply', 'then', 'are', 'limiting', 'life', 'very', 'sad', 'way']",The Hours

591036,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,B00005JKTI,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[3, 4]","""The Hours"" is a breathtaking motion picture experience. The three stories blend together seamlessly, and quite surprisingly, taking the viewer for an emotional ride into the lives of three women, so obviously tormented by their confined sexuality. Virginia Woolf is writing ""Mrs. Dalloway"" in the early 1920's England. Laura Brown is reading the book in 1940's Los Angeles, while trying to bake her husband a birthday cake, and Clarissa Vaughn, a book editor in 2001 New York, has been dubbed ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her friend Richard, a bi-sexual writer dying of AIDS. The three female performances are magnificent. The supporting cast is a knock-out. Many people have called this film depressing, but I don't think it's depressing so much as incredibly true to life, and very real. The emotions experienced by these three women, and the people surrounding them, are no doubt emotions we have all experienced at one point. The film does not shy away from these emotions and that makes it all the more powerful. The words pouring out of the mouths of the characters have such strength and beauty, is it impossible not to be touched. It's fascinating movie-making and the shifting of time periods is absolutely wonderful. Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf comes up with the first sentence for her book. ""Mrs. Dalloway said she'll buy the flowers herself,"" she writes. Laura Brown, the exceptional Julianne Moore in her second Oscar worthy performance of the year, reads the sentence. Then Meryl Streep, as Clarisa ""Dalloway"" Vaughn, tells her lover, ""Sally, I think I'll buy the flowers myself."" It works amazingly well. No doubt many people will be turned off by the film, but one has to appreciate the beauty of such an exhilarating masterpiece. The pulse-pounding musical score, different for each era, only adds to the genuine emotion. This is truly one of the best films of the year, and all three women deserve Oscar nominations.

The dialog is very engaging.  But the tale - when swallowed from a man's point of view - is ultimately very unsatisfying.It takes a while to discover this, but all of the women are gay.  The characters living in the past (Nicole and Julianne Moore) rail against their husbands, and the society that constrains them.  Both try to commit suicide, although only one eventually succeeds.The person living in the present, Meryl Streep, is the only one who is ""out.""  She appears to be the happiest, although her imprisonment comes from the emotional pain she bears while caring for a famous poet -- and former lover -- Ed Harris, who is slowly dying from AIDS.Pruriently, the best parts are definitely the kissing.  Julienne Moore kisses her neighbor - who reacts by retreating into oblivion.  Nicole grabs the face of her sister (yes, sister) and thrusts her face upon her.  The sister resists, but not as though they haven't done this before.Meryl's turn comes towards the end of the movie, and her's is the most reciprocated.  She kisses her lover out of passion and thanks, as if to say to us, `Gee, how surely times have changed!'I thought Nicole looked great with the fake nose, and watching her (as well as the other women) smooch was definitely an unexpected treat.

591039,A319KYEIAZ3SON,B00005JKTI,Mary Whipple,"[7, 9]","Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Hours, becomes a riveting film under the direction of Stephen Daldrey.  Transformed into a screenplay by David Hare, a British playwright who has won both the Olivier Award and the London Theatre Critics Award, the film features Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, and Julianne Moore as three women from three different time periods who face depression, dissatisfaction, and ultimately the option of suicide.Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is neurasthenic and edgy, a survivor of two suicide attempts whose misery is palpable as she writes her novel Mrs. Dalloway in rural England in 1923.  The novel, covering one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, raises questions about the role of women, their ability to find satisfaction in their lives, the options open to them, and ultimately what they owe those who love them as opposed to what they owe themselves.  A parallel plot concerns Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) in Los Angeles in 1951, a fragile woman who is trapped in her marriage, though her husband adores her and her young son depends on her.  She is reading Woolf's novel as an escape.  In the third plot, set in New York in 2001, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), lives like Mrs. Dalloway, ""always giving parties to cover the silence.""  Here the party is for a friend (Ed Harris), dying of AIDS.Complex, both visually and thematically, the film shifts back and forth in time, driven not by plot but by characters who are desperately unhappy and looking for ways to deal with their misery, even to the point of considering suicide.  As the plots and times shift, the reader sees each woman becoming more desperate and her life becoming more fraught, until all plots intersect in the conclusion.  Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey creates stunning, overlapping motifs to unify the scenes--a scene of Clarissa getting up, becomes a scene of Virginia Woolf getting up, and morphs into one of Laura Brown getting up, with her copy of Mrs. Dalloway beside the bed.  Later, a morose Virginia Woolf stares at a dead bird, which becomes the face of Laura Brown, and then Clarissa Vaughan.The acting is intense, as each woman faces a crisis in which suicide is considered, and there is little let-up or relief from this tension.  The score by Philip Glass adds to the disquiet and connects the three stressful plots.  Kidman, who won the Academy Award for Best Actress, plays Woolf without histrionics, while Moore and Streep show their emotions more overtly.  Powerful in its execution, The Hours tells us ""you cannot find peace by avoiding life.""

And boy do they succeed.The film focuses around three women, remarkably portrayed by Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman.Kidman is Virginia Woolf, whom is the key in the plot and a link between the other two characters. As she begins to write ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" perhaps her most famous novel, we see events unfolding in a single day in the lives of two other women in different locations and time periods:Pregnant Laura Brown, in a haunting, nearly silent performance by Moore mainly opposite a small boy, is coming to terms with the fact that she is miserable in her marriage to the humble and loving Dan (John C. Reilly). One of her only comforts is reading Virginia Woolf, in the film mainly ""Mrs. Dalloway.""The third woman is Clarissa Vaughn, in a wonderful performance by Streep, whose link to Woolf is that she is actually living the novel ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" except in present-day New York.As the single day unfolds, the emotions and personalities of the characters are the main focus, much like in Woolf's novels, and the seamless edits and chilling Phillip Glass score contribute to the overall sad mood.All in all, the transition from book to movie is highly successful and smooth, the performances are marvelous, and director Stephen Daldry proves once again how talented he is in his craft.I can also provide evidence for those reading negative reviews: the short running time in one review is actually pushing two hours, and comments about ""no plot"" are made with little knowledge of Virginia Woolf; the plot is the character, and I was as entertained with this movie as any of the other critically hailed films this year.****/****.",5,"Haunting, Beautiful, Sad, a monumental achievement",1051574400,"04 29, 2003",2003,1810,"['writer', 'film', 'achieved', 'impossible', 'movie', 'business', 'create', 'intruiging', 'beautiful', 'yet', 'filmable', 'version', 'very', 'untheatrical', 'novel', 'boy', 'do', 'succeed.The', 'film', 'focuses', 'three', 'women', 'remarkably', 'portrayed', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Nicole', 'Kidman.Kidman', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'whom', 'key', 'plot', 'link', 'other', 'two', 'characters', 'write', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'perhaps', 'most', 'famous', 'novel', 'see', 'events', 'unfolding', 'single', 'day', 'lives', 'two', 'other', 'women', 'different', 'locations', 'time', 'periods', 'Pregnant', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'haunting', 'nearly', 'silent', 'performance', 'Moore', 'mainly', 'opposite', 'small', 'boy', 'coming', 'terms', 'fact', 'miserable', 'marriage', 'humble', 'loving', 'Dan', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'One', 'only', 'comforts', 'reading', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'film', 'mainly', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'third', 'woman', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Streep', 'link', 'Woolf', 'actually', 'living', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'present-day', 'New', 'York.As', 'single', 'day', 'unfolds', 'emotions', 'personalities', 'characters', 'are', 'main', 'focus', 'much', 'Woolf', 'novels', 'seamless', 'edits', 'chilling', 'Phillip', 'Glass', 'score', 'contribute', 'overall', 'sad', 'mood.All', 'transition', 'book', 'movie', 'highly', 'successful', 'smooth', 'performances', 'are', 'marvelous', 'director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'once', 'again', 'how', 'talented', 'craft.I', 'can', 'also', 'provide', 'evidence', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'short', 'running', 'time', 'one', 'review', 'actually', 'pushing', 'two', 'hours', 'comments', 'plot', 'are', 'made', 'little', 'knowledge', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'plot', 'character', 'was', 'entertained', 'movie', 'other', 'critically', 'hailed', 'films', 'year', '****/****']",The Hours

591042,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JKTI,Matthew Horner,"[41, 53]","""The Hours"" may or may not be the best English-language movie to have been released in 2002, but it is, to me, the most exquisite and delicate. As such, it is not designed to be a commercial movie for mass consumption; indeed, its relative box office success can probably be attributed to its powerhouse cast, led by Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. To people who love great acting, any one of these women in a movie makes it worth seeing. To have all three together is rather intimidating, and that fact, I believe, is what lead to some of the movie's negative reviews since, with that much talent, a project can be seen as all about the stars. Adding to the talent overload are such marvelous actors as Miranda Richardson, Claire Danes, Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, Toni Collette, Allison Janney and Stephen Dillane.The movie, based on a Pulitzer prize winning novel, contains three stories which touch upon each other but rarely actually connect, the common thread being English author Virginia Woolf [Kidman] and her novel, `Mrs. Dalloway"". Woolf was a brilliant writer who suffered from severe mental illness. She committed suicide in 1941 when she finally could no long cope with her disease. There is the story of Laura Brown [Moore], set in 1951, in which the character, who is reading Woolf's book, toys with the idea of suicide. The last story revolves around Clarissa Vaughn [Streep]. Set in present day, it is about her relationship with her ex-lover [Ed Harris], who is dying from AIDS and whose only out seems to be to kill himself. On the surface, all this dallying with suicide may seem grim and depressing, the movie is actually life-affirming, but, as I've said, it's not meant for mass consumption.Kidman deserved her Oscar for Best Actress in ""The Hours"". Like Bette Davis before her, she is always willing to take on an acting challenge. Here, having donned a prosthetic nose, she is barely recognizable. Still, I wish there were an Oscar for Best Ensemble Acting because that is the one ""The Hours"" should have received because each remarkable individual performance adds to the power of the film as a whole.",5,A stunning cinematic achievement,1057449600,"07 6, 2003",2003,2143,"['Hours', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'best', 'English-language', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'released', '2002', 'most', 'exquisite', 'delicate', 'such', 'not', 'designed', 'be', 'commercial', 'movie', 'mass', 'consumption', 'indeed', 'relative', 'box', 'office', 'success', 'can', 'probably', 'be', 'attributed', 'powerhouse', 'cast', 'led', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'great', 'acting', 'one', 'women', 'movie', 'worth', 'seeing', 'have', 'three', 'together', 'rather', 'intimidating', 'fact', 'believe', 'what', 'lead', 'movie', 'negative', 'reviews', 'much', 'talent', 'project', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'stars', 'Adding', 'talent', 'overload', 'are', 'such', 'marvelous', 'actors', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Stephen', 'Dillane.The', 'movie', 'based', 'Pulitzer', 'prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'three', 'stories', 'touch', 'other', 'rarely', 'actually', 'connect', 'common', 'thread', 'being', 'English', 'author', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', '[', 'Kidman', ']', 'novel', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'Woolf', 'was', 'brilliant', 'writer', 'who', 'suffered', 'severe', 'mental', 'illness', 'committed', 'suicide', '1941', 'when', 'finally', 'could', 'no', 'long', 'cope', 'disease', 'story', 'Laura', 'Brown', '[', 'Moore', ']', 'set', '1951', 'character', 'who', 'reading', 'Woolf', 'book', 'idea', 'suicide', 'last', 'story', 'revolves', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', '[', 'Streep', ']', 'Set', 'present', 'day', 'relationship', 'ex-lover', '[', 'Ed', 'Harris', ']', 'who', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'only', 'out', 'be', 'kill', 'surface', 'dallying', 'suicide', 'may', 'seem', 'grim', 'depressing', 'movie', 'actually', 'life-affirming', ""'ve"", 'said', 'not', 'meant', 'mass', 'consumption.Kidman', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Hours', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'always', 'willing', 'take', 'acting', 'challenge', 'Here', 'having', 'donned', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'barely', 'recognizable', 'Still', 'wish', 'were', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Ensemble', 'Acting', 'one', 'Hours', 'should', 'have', 'received', 'remarkable', 'individual', 'performance', 'power', 'film', 'whole']",The Hours
591043,A1ARA52HB238HT,B00005JKTI,"Matthew M. Yau ""Voracious reader""","[2, 5]","I find the movie very delightful in remaining faithful to Michael Cunningham's novel except for some minor details. The scene in which Clarissa Vaughan bumps into Walter Hardy and invites him to the poet's party is omitted in the film. The scene in which Louis (ex-partner of the AIDS-stricken poet to whom Clarissa provides care for) confesses to Clarissa his affair with his student is truncated. Another minor inconsistency is time. The novel describes Clarissa pauses at the threshold of the vestibule door on a June morning; while Meryl Streep, with light-blue stained spectacles and lemon-colored dangling earrings, walks down West 10th Avenue strewn with snow. No big deal.The Hours is a difficult one to film. It's not the straightforward narrative type of movie. It begins with Virginia Woolf wading in a river committing suicide. The crosscutting between three women at different times and space (Virginia Woolf recuperating from her mental illness in Richmond in 1923; Clarissa Vaughan kicking off a busy day preparing for a party to celebrate merits of a poet in New York City in 2001; and Laura Brown frustrating herself making a birthday cake that looks too amateurish in 1950s, Los Angeles suburb) proves to be challenging for both the crew and audience. In the first 30 minutes or so, the screen jumps from one woman to another, back and forth in time, to establish the common thread of these three women. Viewers who are not familiar with the book might not be able to spell out what this crosscutting makes of.Two thirds of the film focuses on Clarissa's day that serves as the artery of the film. Meryl Streep delivers a solid performance playing Clarissa who is unhappy and melancholy though living a full life. The scene in which she breaks down while telling Louis about Richard's illness is striking. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a Los Angeles housewife from the 1950s. She too, is not happy with her life though she has a perfectly happy marriage and a cute 3-year-old boy. Laura wants freedom from motherhood and duties of a wife. She will go so far as to leave her own son with a neighbor for a few hours, check into a hotel room and read undisturbed. Then we have Nicole Kidman as the writer Virginia Woolf who suffers from mental illness and hallucinations. I really enjoy seeing her getting on the wrong foot with her servant Nelly, whom she sends off to London for ginger biscuit and China tea impromptu. Kidman adroitly captures Woolf's brooding and grudging intensity. No less impressive is the tenderness she shows when her niece Angelica buries a dead bird in the Hogarth House garden.Viewers might question the whole purpose of chronicling a woman's day. I think the film is well done in the sense that unity of the novel is preserved. A notable flaw is that the film gives away the end too soon, at least sooner than it should. You'll know what I mean if you read the book prior to viewing the film. Philip Glass has done the background scores in piano that is a little too loud at times and withstands the acting (Is that intended?) I'm not in the least turned off by the shortcomings. I recommend everyone to see the film and treat oneself to a dazzling performance by a brilliant cast. 4.5 stars.",4,"Contrieved and faithful to the book; well-casted, dazzling",1049587200,"04 6, 2003",2003,3237,"['find', 'movie', 'very', 'delightful', 'remaining', 'faithful', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'novel', 'minor', 'details', 'scene', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'Walter', 'Hardy', 'poet', 'party', 'omitted', 'film', 'scene', 'Louis', 'ex-partner', 'AIDS-stricken', 'poet', 'whom', 'Clarissa', 'care', 'confesses', 'Clarissa', 'affair', 'student', 'truncated', 'minor', 'inconsistency', 'time', 'novel', 'describes', 'Clarissa', 'threshold', 'vestibule', 'door', 'June', 'morning', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'light-blue', 'stained', 'spectacles', 'lemon-colored', 'dangling', 'earrings', 'walks', 'down', 'West', '10th', 'Avenue', 'strewn', 'snow', 'big', 'deal.The', 'Hours', 'difficult', 'one', 'film', 'not', 'straightforward', 'narrative', 'type', 'movie', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'wading', 'river', 'committing', 'suicide', 'crosscutting', 'three', 'women', 'different', 'times', 'space', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'recuperating', 'mental', 'illness', 'Richmond', '1923', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'kicking', 'off', 'busy', 'day', 'preparing', 'party', 'celebrate', 'merits', 'poet', 'New', 'York', 'City', '2001', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'frustrating', 'making', 'birthday', 'cake', 'too', 'amateurish', '1950s', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'suburb', 'be', 'challenging', 'crew', 'audience', 'first', '30', 'minutes', 'so', 'screen', 'jumps', 'one', 'woman', 'back', 'forth', 'time', 'establish', 'common', 'thread', 'three', 'women', 'Viewers', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'book', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'spell', 'out', 'what', 'crosscutting', 'of.Two', 'thirds', 'film', 'Clarissa', 'day', 'artery', 'film', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'solid', 'performance', 'playing', 'Clarissa', 'who', 'unhappy', 'melancholy', 'living', 'full', 'life', 'scene', 'down', 'telling', 'Louis', 'Richard', 'illness', 'striking', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'housewife', '1950s', 'too', 'not', 'happy', 'life', 'perfectly', 'happy', 'marriage', 'cute', '3-year-old', 'boy', 'Laura', 'freedom', 'motherhood', 'duties', 'wife', 'will', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'leave', 'own', 'son', 'neighbor', 'few', 'hours', 'check', 'hotel', 'room', 'read', 'undisturbed', 'Then', 'have', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'writer', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'who', 'mental', 'illness', 'hallucinations', 'really', 'enjoy', 'seeing', 'getting', 'wrong', 'foot', 'servant', 'Nelly', 'whom', 'London', 'ginger', 'biscuit', 'China', 'tea', 'impromptu', 'Kidman', 'adroitly', 'Woolf', 'brooding', 'grudging', 'intensity', 'less', 'impressive', 'tenderness', 'when', 'niece', 'Angelica', 'dead', 'bird', 'Hogarth', 'House', 'garden.Viewers', 'might', 'question', 'whole', 'purpose', 'chronicling', 'woman', 'day', 'think', 'film', 'well', 'done', 'sense', 'unity', 'novel', 'preserved', 'notable', 'flaw', 'film', 'away', 'end', 'too', 'soon', 'least', 'sooner', 'should', ""'ll"", 'know', 'what', 'mean', 'read', 'book', 'prior', 'viewing', 'film', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'done', 'background', 'piano', 'little', 'too', 'loud', 'times', 'acting', 'intended', ""'m"", 'not', 'least', 'turned', 'off', 'shortcomings', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'see', 'film', 'treat', 'dazzling', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'cast', '4.5', 'stars']",The Hours

As another reviewer said, this is not just a film, it is an experience (and one worth having)...If possible, try to see it when you are not particularly sad, because the story in itself is pretty gloomy. It talks about  depression, bleakness, suicide, sexual identity confusion and lack of purpose. The whole film is pervaded by hopelessness and ennui, and the melancholia is omnipresent.On the other hand, Stephen Daldry (the director) somehow managed to achieve magnificently what previously seemed impossible: a movie based on Cunningham's book, ""The hours"". Where is the difficulty, you might ask (only if you haven't seen the movie)?. Well, the answer is in the plot of the film, based on three women: Virginia Wolff, Clarissa Vaughan  and Laura Brown. They live in different times and cultures, but they share something: a feeling of vacuity, a total absence of matter,an all encompasing emptiness that threatens them... It is really beautiful to see how  the film goes seamlessly from one woman's life to that of the other: there is a wonderfully perfect inconsistence that is only explained (and linked) at the end of the movie. You must pay attention, because the film, in order to link the story, shifts permanently forwards and backwards in time. However, that extra attention is compensated when at the last minutes of this movie you comprehend the meaning of the name of the film, and which is the link (besides those that are evident) between these sories.Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman)is depicted as an intelligent woman battling against madness in the 1923 England, while she starts to write what will be one of her best novels, ""Mrs. Dalloway""... Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep), a successful literary agent in the present, is  planning a party for her former lover, who is now dying of AIDS. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), a seemingly happy pregnant woman in 1949 Los Angeles, is trying to make a cake for her husband's birthday, while she starts to read ""Mrs. Dalloway"".

One is Virginia Woolf(Nicole Kidman) who is living in 1931, and is writing her book, Mrs. Dalloway.  Virginia also has some problems though, in that she hears voices, and is also suicidal.  The next is Laura Brown(Julianne Moore) who is living in 1949.  She is a pregnant houswife, who has a loving husband(John C. Reily) and a young son.  However, she is unhappy with her life for various reasons, and is contemplating suicide.  She is planning to make a cake for her husband, and seems to be broken up about many different things.  Then, there is Clarissa Vaughn(Meryl Streep), a lesbian who is planning a dinner party that night for Richard(Ed Harris)her ex-lover, who has just won the top prize for poetry writing, and is also dieing from AIDS.What makes the film work so well is the acting.  A film like this requires that we care about the characters.  The dialouge is well written and the acting is off the charts.  Without brilliant performances, this film would not be nearly as good as it is.  The reason acting is the key factor in this film is because 99% of the film is dialouge.  There's no action, no sex, or anything other than the characters talking.  That's just fine with me.I found everyone in the film so intriguing and intresting.  The film is two hours, but I felt as though it could've gone on for another two hours and I still wouldn't have been board.Another highlight of the film is the beautiful score from composer Philip Glass, whose music makes the scenes complete.  It fits the film too, because most of the music is like someone gradually gaining anger or frustration, and then exploding or wanting to explode.Nicole Kidman won Best Actress for this film at the oscars, and rightfully so.

Woolf's Dalloway is a woman who outwardly has it together but as the story unfolds we see her slowly but surely falling apart.Daldry's film of Michael Cunningham's novel is audacious in it's physical design but more importantly in it's ability and assurance when it deals with the emotions involved with being a human being whether it be 1920's England, 1950's California or 2002 New York City.Even though in essence, the three women in ""The Hours"" are radically different in temperament, focus and style, Daldry is more interested in what makes them similar. The three women he focuses on in ""The Hours"": Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) are troubled in various ways but share a commonality that makes their concerns and situations Universal no matter from which era they come.The acting in ""The Hours"" is of the highest order: natural, multi-colored and intense: Kidman, Streep and especially Moore are not only out for blood but for Truth as well.

While she wants desperately to return to a more stimulating environment in London, the ideas for her next novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"" begin to form in her mind. In 1951 Los Angeles, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a housewife with a loving husband and engaging little boy. But that life is unsuited to her and, finding it  unbearable, she seeks refuge in Woolf's novel ""Mrs. Dalloway"". In New York City 2001, Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is planning a party for an old friend. Her friend, a poet named Richard (Ed Harris), nicknamed her ""Mrs. Dalloway"" when they were young. Now he is dying, and Clarissa is left to reflect on their relationship and the life she has made for herself.""The  Hours"" is a character study of these three women, based on the novel by Michael Cunningham. The three women are very different in character and circumstance, but are linked, not only by ""Mrs. Dalloway"", but by their emotional isolation and the thoughts of death that engulf them. ""The Hours"" shows us only one day in the lives of each of these characters. We learn enough about them to make them interesting, but not so much as to  make them tedious. The performances by Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep, as well as the supporting cast, are excellent. Much has been made of the prosthetic nose which Nicole Kidman donned for her role as Virginia Woolf, and she truly is unrecognizable in the film. But it is her voice, which is changed as radically as her face, which transforms her into Woolf. Her performance really is impressive and may be her best work to date. Kidman easily holds her own next to the more experienced and acclaimed thespians, Streep and Moore. Meryl Streep's performance here is better than her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Adaptation"", so this is a must for Streep fans.

Perhaps not, the role was one that I feel was not large enough for a leading role Oscar, and as Denzel Washington said as he gave her the award that night. ""Nicole Kidman by a nose!""

One is a depressed wife in 1950's Los Angeles (Julianne Moore), one is a divorced woman in modern day New York (Meryl Streep), and one, well, IS Virginia Wolf (Nicole Kidman). All the main actresses play their roles very well, and it is Kidman (almost unrecognisable with her prosthetic nose) who delivers the films best performance.The three stories overall link together well, although not as well as many people have claimed, as the time changes did seem a little laboured at times. All the women are affected by Wolf's novel Mrs.Dalloway and all bear an uncanny resemblance to her character, which was cleverly portrayed. Nearly all of the characters in the film are unhappy, and the overall mood of the film is a dark and haunting one, which added to the atmosphere.The Hours is a good film, perhaps very good, but nothing more than that; it lacked the execution to make it a great film.

591060,ARDKWR8F9UW3,B00005JKTI,M. Scagnelli,"[2, 5]","Stephen Daldry's film The Hours is among the best films of the last few years. The performances are very powerful from the whole cast, with Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore shining the brightest. Daldry's move from stage to screen is proving to be great for film, receiving many nominations for both The Hours and Billy Elliot. He is possibly the only director that has recieved Academy Award nominations for best director for his first two movies.The Hours may be a complicated movie, but no more difficult to understand than alot of great movies. The plot unfolds in three different people's lives during different decades. These stories interweve and you notice coincidences and connections in the characters more and more, which I will not give away. It is hard to compare this style of storytelling to other films, but It reminded me of Magnolia, although not as ambitious, and a little bit like Memento, but not backwards.

591061,A1S5B32WYMEE44,B00005JKTI,"M. Swinney ""Marc My Words""","[5, 5]","&quot;The Hours&quot; is indeed a powerful film.  The power trio of Kidman, Moore, and Streep turn in a subtly nuanced coup d' grace of a performance that to watch is to sit on the sidelines of a Super Bowl of an event of acting.&quot;The Hours&quot; is a skillful tale of interwoven lives threaded together through different ages and times; held together by a concept, an idea, and a tale--Virginia Wolff's &quot;Mrs. Dalloway.&quot;  Each life is somewhat affected by the other as Virginia Wolff unconsciously pulls the strings in the writing of a story.  When Kidman's character proclaims, &quot;We still have to decide the fate of our heroine (largely paraphrased, mind you),&quot; as the audience, we sit with baited breath knowing the stroke of her pen will determine the fate of Moore's post-WWII houswife's life and Streep's 2001 New York City socialite life.The screenplay and director's editing are quite a notch above creative genius.  In the opening scenes there are flowers and the scenes switches effortlessly from one of the woman's life to the other as they prepare for the looming weight of a fateful day each with flowers in the mix.  The effect is that we suspend time and follow the stories without conscious thought stepping back and forth.  The three stories in effect become one, held together by the overriding sense that they are not happy lives, they are not lives of freedom, but lives subservient to the will of others.One of the best features of this DVD is the voice over narrative of Streep, Moore, and Kidman.  It is illuminating to hear their individual approach to acting and their experiences making this film.  It is like an acting class taught by the most prominent acting greats of our times.  It was very interesting to hear that Streep was proud that she was the only actress that gets up in the morning looking like she had been asleep.  She is proud of this fact and points it out.  That's a film perspective we didn't get in past film classics and makes the DVD purchase worth the price of admission.

591062,A20ZFWGBY4REFX,B00005JKTI,"Nicholas Williams ""movie, music, and book fan""","[18, 21]","To me, the premise of ""The Hours"" was a little intimidating to me before I finally managed to see the film: Three women are linked through three time periods to Virginia Woolf's novel 'Mrs. Dalloway'. I was concerned that my blazing ignorance to Ms. Woolf's work, and this one in particular, would hinder my enjoyment of the film and my ability to understand it. Not so. Yes, 'Mrs. Dalloway' was at the root of the three stories presented, but everything you need to know is in the film. This is it, basically: Mrs. Dalloway decides one morning -- the morning of a party she is throwing -- that she will buy the flowers herself. Though she projects the appearance of togetherness and cheer, she is a lonely, empty woman inside. Oh, and someone dies at the end. That's it.In ""The Hours"", we meet three women. First is Virginia herself (Nicole Kidman), and our introduction comes in the form of her 1941 suicide at the age of 59. A feminist Ophelia, she places a stone in her dress pocket, walks to a nearby stream, and lets it carry her away. Her brief, mortal stroll is voiced-over by her suicide letter, which explains to her husband that this act of desperation is to spare him the madness she feels is returning. The rest of her story takes place in 1923 as 'Mrs. Dalloway' is working its way out of her. Flashing forward to 1951, we see Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), depressed housewife of WWII veteran Dan (John C. Reilly) and mother of a young son. It's Dan's birthday, and Laura, in the middle of reading 'Mrs. Dalloway', decides that she will feel better today and bake a cake. Cut to 2001, and publisher Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is preparing a reception for author and friend (and long-ago lover) Richard (Ed Harris). Richard has just won a prestigious poetry award but is too ill from AIDS and related dementia to want to go to the party.Each of these women are depressed. Each awakes and acquires flowers. Each has something special going on that day -- a party of sorts. Each of these women kisses another woman. They all face suicide, and they all face the choice between death and the imprisonment of life. They each make a choice. The variations on these choices, while sometimes disorienting, are exactingly faithful to each other. Sometimes they reveal themselves suddenly, consecutively. Other times they surface gradually, inconspicuously. Like Philip Glass' subtle, driving score, they build gracefully from a whisper into a cry and by film's end find themselves whispering again.""The Hours"" is a miracle of a movie. Literate, involving, active -- it is that rare film about women and their unique experiences that neither excludes nor condemns the role of men in their lives. The men of ""The Hours"", Woolf' stoic and supportive husband (Stephen Dillane), Brown's husband and son, poet Richard, and his former lover Louis (Jeff Daniels) -- the sexual politics of the film are sometimes scattered but fascinating -- are innocent bystanders who, while making decisions to maintain or find their own happiness, neither victims nor devalue these unhappy women. Their depressions are unto themselves, and their lives entrap them in ways that their respective others cannot assist or understand.All of the performances in ""The Hours"" are excellent, uniquely extraordinary, and utterly unforgettable. Ms. Kidman, unrecognizable behind a prosthetic nose, does more refined work here than I have ever seen from her. Her Woolf is depressed but never pitiful and always strong whatever the hardship. Ms. Moore, playing a very different '50s housewife from her ""Far From Heaven"" turn, gets it just right. In the midst of true depression, something as simple as baking a cake becomes an overwhelming, impossible task. Moore's battle with the cake is heartbreakingly sorrowful when she fails, yet somehow sadder when she gets it right. Ms. Streep, meanwhile, shows us again why she is Streep -- equally profound unraveling before the party and, in a devastating scene at the end, as she just listens to a voice from the past that puts things into perspective.Sad, but never far from hope, ""The Hours"" not only also has an outstanding supporting cast (including Claire Danes, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson) and superb direction from Stephen Daldry (""Billy Elliot""), it is also one of the finest films of 2003 and of recent memory. A great DVD must-own for any Nicole Kidman fan, any Julianne Moore fan, or even any Meryl Streep fan!",5,"Kidman, Moore, and Streep give tour de force performances!!",1043798400,"01 29, 2003",2003,4449,"['premise', 'Hours', 'was', 'little', 'intimidating', 'finally', 'managed', 'see', 'film', 'Three', 'women', 'are', 'linked', 'three', 'time', 'periods', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'novel', ""'Mrs"", 'Dalloway', 'was', 'concerned', 'blazing', 'ignorance', 'Ms.', 'Woolf', 'work', 'one', 'particular', 'would', 'hinder', 'enjoyment', 'film', 'ability', 'understand', 'Not', 'so', 'Yes', 'Dalloway', 'was', 'root', 'three', 'stories', 'presented', 'everything', 'need', 'know', 'film', 'basically', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'one', 'morning', 'morning', 'party', 'throwing', 'will', 'buy', 'flowers', 'projects', 'appearance', 'togetherness', 'cheer', 'lonely', 'empty', 'woman', 'inside', 'Oh', 'someone', 'dies', 'end', 'it.In', 'Hours', 'meet', 'three', 'women', 'First', 'Virginia', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'introduction', 'form', '1941', 'suicide', 'age', '59', 'feminist', 'Ophelia', 'stone', 'dress', 'pocket', 'walks', 'nearby', 'stream', 'carry', 'away', 'brief', 'mortal', 'stroll', 'voiced-over', 'suicide', 'letter', 'husband', 'act', 'desperation', 'spare', 'madness', 'returning', 'rest', 'story', 'place', '1923', ""'Mrs"", 'Dalloway', 'working', 'way', 'Flashing', 'forward', '1951', 'see', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'depressed', 'housewife', 'WWII', 'veteran', 'Dan', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'mother', 'young', 'son', 'Dan', 'birthday', 'Laura', 'middle', 'reading', ""'Mrs"", 'Dalloway', 'will', 'feel', 'better', 'today', 'bake', 'cake', 'Cut', '2001', 'publisher', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughan', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'preparing', 'reception', 'author', 'friend', 'long-ago', 'lover', 'Richard', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Richard', 'just', 'won', 'prestigious', 'poetry', 'award', 'too', 'ill', 'AIDS', 'related', 'dementia', 'want', 'go', 'party.Each', 'women', 'are', 'depressed', 'awakes', 'flowers', 'something', 'special', 'going', 'day', 'party', 'sorts', 'women', 'woman', 'face', 'suicide', 'face', 'choice', 'death', 'imprisonment', 'life', 'make', 'choice', 'variations', 'choices', 'sometimes', 'disorienting', 'are', 'exactingly', 'faithful', 'other', 'Sometimes', 'reveal', 'suddenly', 'consecutively', 'Other', 'times', 'surface', 'gradually', 'inconspicuously', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'subtle', 'driving', 'score', 'build', 'gracefully', 'whisper', 'cry', 'film', 'end', 'find', 'whispering', 'again', 'Hours', 'miracle', 'movie', 'Literate', 'involving', 'active', 'rare', 'film', 'women', 'unique', 'experiences', 'excludes', 'condemns', 'role', 'men', 'lives', 'men', 'Hours', 'Woolf', 'stoic', 'supportive', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Brown', 'husband', 'son', 'poet', 'Richard', 'former', 'lover', 'Louis', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'sexual', 'politics', 'film', 'are', 'sometimes', 'scattered', 'fascinating', 'are', 'innocent', 'bystanders', 'who', 'making', 'decisions', 'maintain', 'find', 'own', 'happiness', 'victims', 'devalue', 'unhappy', 'women', 'depressions', 'are', 'unto', 'lives', 'entrap', 'ways', 'respective', 'others', 'can', 'not', 'assist', 'understand.All', 'performances', 'Hours', 'are', 'excellent', 'uniquely', 'extraordinary', 'utterly', 'unforgettable', 'Ms.', 'Kidman', 'unrecognizable', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'more', 'refined', 'work', 'here', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Woolf', 'depressed', 'never', 'pitiful', 'always', 'strong', 'hardship', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'playing', 'very', 'different', ""'50s"", 'housewife', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'turn', 'just', 'right', 'midst', 'true', 'depression', 'something', 'as', 'simple', 'baking', 'cake', 'overwhelming', 'impossible', 'task', 'Moore', 'battle', 'cake', 'heartbreakingly', 'sorrowful', 'when', 'yet', 'somehow', 'sadder', 'when', 'right', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'meanwhile', 'again', 'why', 'Streep', 'equally', 'unraveling', 'party', 'devastating', 'scene', 'end', 'just', 'voice', 'past', 'things', 'perspective.Sad', 'never', 'far', 'hope', 'Hours', 'not', 'only', 'also', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'cast', 'including', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'superb', 'direction', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'also', 'one', 'finest', 'films', '2003', 'recent', 'memory', 'great', 'DVD', 'must-own', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'fan', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'fan', 'even', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'fan']",The Hours

Each story concerns a woman trying to define herself, to identify what she needs, and to find a way to get it.The 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write her first successful novel, ""Mrs. Dallaway""; which is the story of one day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dallaway. The story set in the early 1950's concerns a Laura Brown (Moore) who is reading ""Mrs. Dallaway"". Finally the contemporary story concerns Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) who is essentially living Mrs. Dallaway's life in modern NYC. All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast. It is as if each member of the ensemble brought out the best in each other.Some interesting and not always obvious things to look for as you watch ""The Hours"" are:Each story begins with the husband/lover of each woman leading the camera to the woman. All three women are found in bed and this begins a match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate stories. Woolf writes: ""Mrs. Dallaway said she would buy the flowers herself"" just as Laura Brown reads that sentence and Clarissa speaks that sentence.Kidman's Woolf is an amazing character. She is a psychological mess, making life difficult for those around her and full of torment and despair. Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating.Like ""The Big Chill"", this is an ambitious character study film with many characters. By necessity, both films rely more on behavioral language than dialogue in revealing the personality of its characters. Note Laura Brown's (Moore) neatness obsession as she readies her house and herself prior to leaving for the hotel.Woolf began the book ""Mrs. Dallaway"" with the intention of basing it on a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide. Brown describes the book to her neighbor as: ""Oh, it's about this woman who's incredibly - well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and she's going to give a party. And, maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't"".At its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of art, writing a book-baking a cake-giving a party. Each woman/artist is driven and frustrated by a need for unattainable perfection. There is a touch of irony to each situation. For example, Laura Brown is where she is because her husband has pulled her into the great American dream without realizing that it was the worse thing he could do to her. Although all three women love their children/child/niece, those relationships do not give them what they need.There is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the self-definition process each woman is going through. Virginia kisses her sister Vanessa (brilliantly played by Miranda Richardson who looks amazingly like she could have been Kidman's sister), desperately trying to force a better connection with her. Vanessa understands this, she is not shocked by the kiss but by the implication that her sister needs this so desperately.Sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity. Each woman has a child picking up on their needs, which the adults around them do not seem to be aware of.Watch the scene where Laura's husband is urging her to come to bed. Moore's voice does not betray the revulsion or the internal struggle which only viewers can see on her face. In fact at this point each woman's partner is urging her to go to bed but each must first a make choice. Then watch for the great match cut, Virginia announces that she has decided that the poet will die in her novel and they cut to little Richard lying in his bed. Moore's expression finally tells us that she has decided to leave her family. Streep's kiss signifies her recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and her choice to embrace it and move forward.Ultimately this film is about the increasing difficulty we have as we get older in making choices. This is because as we discover who we are, we also experience loss and accumulate grief over the course of our lives, becoming ever more aware of the cost of our choices. Like the Moonlight Graham character in ""Field of Dreams"" (who assumed he would have more than one major league at bat), Clarissa looks back on a short moment that she thought was the beginning of happiness and realizes that it was her only moment of actual happiness.There are some criticisms of this film. That it is not political enough but rather is for the elite and about the elite, or conversely that it is condescending to the masses with too obvious a message told in an unnecessarily simplistic way, and finally that it is a success of structure rather than ideas. Whatever the validity of these issues, the very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best testimonial the film could have. My only criticism was a production design issue (young Richard gets his Lincoln logs out of a Erector Set box).Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5,Some Random Thoughts from a Twisted Mind,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,5481,"['Hours', 'more', 'up', 'critical', 'praise', 'nothing', 'else', 'must', 'see', 'originality',

Reilly, Ed Harris, Miranda Richardson, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Eileen Atkins, Toni Collette, and Claire Danes.  Even with this cast, though, I couldn't get myself to give this film a 10.  For some reason, I felt unattached to the Nicole Kidman - Stephen Dillane segment.Not surprisingly, I was most affected by the Meryl Streep - Ed Harris segment.  I thought that their unrequited love, which is brought to both characters attention constantly, was genuinely constructed by all the characters involved.  It shows how this unrequited love affects not only Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris, but also Ms. Janney and Mr. Daniels.  Everyone in the segment knows that Ms. Streep and Mr. Harris should have been together, and that in most intimate ways, they are.The segment that I found myself most drawn to was the Julianne Moore - John C. Reilly segment.  Watching Ms. Moore hide her true feelings from her son and Mr. Reilly was heartwrenching.  And while Mr. Reilly has the face of a true character actor, I am constantly amazed at the emotions that come across on Ms. Moore's face.  She has a face as smooth and beautiful as a Michaelangelo statue ... a porcelain skin too beautiful for words.  And yet she manages to use this face as an awesome tool in her considerble acting resource &quot;closet&quot;.  This becomes very clear as her face is hidden beneath latex in later scenes.  Underneath the latex, she becomes less interesting and lucky for us director Stephen Daldry notices this as well and keeps that scene as short as possible.Unfortunately Ms. Kidman does not fare as well.  Her performance - and that of Stephen Dillane - is great, no doubts about it.  But for some reason I was strangely uninvolved in her segment.  I found the other two to be so much less conventional that this segment, even anchored by the great work of Mr. Dillane and Ms. Kidman, seemed somewhat pedestrian.  I venture to guess that this segment was the easiest to write and direct.In the end, I thought it was cool the way Harold Pinter and Stephen Daldry (and, I presume, Michael Cunningham) tied it all together.  Thematically it was tied together all the way through, but they really tie it up well.Perhaps the greatest comment I can give the movie is to say that I am curious to read MRS. DALLOWAY now.

591072,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B00005JKTI,OverTheMoon,"[5, 10]","The Hours is supposed to be a three story film where the characters are linked by depression and suicide although they themselves may not be suffering from these ailments but are close to someone who is. The stories are interlaced by these connections and by the book ""Mrs Dalloway"" by Virginia Woolf who also appears as one the main characters in one of the three stories. Its heavy on despair, misery, hopelessness and death.The movie has some great acting from Meryl Streep but unfortunately the other cast are not really as functional as you would have expected. The movie does go to that next level in makeup effects such as aging, changing a persons face completely and the presentation of an aids victim. Tops marks all round for these effects and costumes but do these things make a film?No, they do not. Stephen Daldry is not a very good director and if you did not like Billy Elliot then you will probably not like this vehicle either. He is an up-and-coming director but his work seems very amateurish as if he is not really conscious about the material at hand and realizing his vision onto the screen. Its ends up with many loose ends and missing connections that should have be made.Nichole Kidmans character of Virginia Woolf ends up saying and doing very little. In most scenes she is just standing around doing or saying nothing. Unfortunately Julianne Moore goes one step beyond Kidmans character by simply walking straight off the set for ""Far from Heaven"" giving up a double-dose of a helpless woman in despair. The only one of the three that stands out is Meryl Streep and her performance is to be commended. Sadly John C. Reilly is wasted by also saying and doing very little but Ed Harris regrettably overacts his character to the point of killing any realism that he once had. Surprisingly enough the movie ends up not being as moving as what it makes itself out to be.In short this movie is a misfire in a lot of ways and is pretty hollow overall. It is no ""Remains of the Day"", ""Shadowlands"", ""Magnolia"" or ""Beaches"" if that is what you are expecting.",2,Too Pretentious and very disconnected,1066953600,"10 24, 2003",2003,2077,"['Hours', 'supposed', 'be', 'three', 'story', 'film', 'where', 'characters', 'are', 'linked', 'depression', 'suicide', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'suffering', 'ailments', 'are', 'close', 'someone', 'who', 'stories', 'are', 'interlaced', 'connections', 'book', 'Mrs', 'Dalloway', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'who', 'also', 'one', 'main', 'characters', 'one', 'three', 'stories', 'heavy', 'despair', 'misery', 'hopelessness', 'death.The', 'movie', 'great', 'acting', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'unfortunately', 'other', 'cast', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'as', 'functional', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'movie', 'go', 'next', 'level', 'makeup', 'effects', 'such', 'aging', 'changing', 'persons', 'face', 'completely', 'presentation', 'aids', 'victim', 'Tops', 'round', 'effects', 'costumes', 'do', 'things', 'make', 'film', 'No', 'do', 'not', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'Billy', 'Elliot', 'then', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'vehicle', 'either', 'up-and-coming', 'director', 'work', 'very', 'amateurish', 'not', 'really', 'conscious', 'material', 'hand', 'realizing', 'vision', 'screen', 'up', 'many', 'loose', 'ends', 'missing', 'connections', 'should', 'have', 'be', 'made.Nichole', 'Kidmans', 'character', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'up', 'saying', 'doing', 'very', 'little', 'most', 'scenes', 'just', 'standing', 'around', 'doing', 'saying', 'nothing', 'Unfortunately', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'one', 'step', 'Kidmans', 'character', 'simply', 'walking', 'straight', 'off', 'set', 'Far', 'Heaven', 'giving', 'up', 'double-dose', 'helpless', 'woman', 'despair', 'only', 'one', 'three', 'out', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performance', 'be', 'commended', 'Sadly', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'wasted', 'also', 'saying', 'doing', 'very', 'little', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'regrettably', 'character', 'point', 'killing', 'realism', 'once', 'had', 'Surprisingly', 'movie', 'up', 'not', 'being', 'as', 'moving', 'what', 'out', 'be.In', 'short', 'movie', 'misfire', 'lot', 'ways', 'pretty', 'hollow', 'overall', 'Remains', 'Day', 'Shadowlands', 'Magnolia', 'Beaches', 'what', 'are', 'expecting']",The Hours

Kidman sits around all day in a huge house with servants, next to a huge garden, has a husband who adores her and will do anything she wants, and she can basically do whatever she wants and write whatever she wants at her own pace. Yet all she does is mope around, act weird when a bird dies, come on to her sister, and obsess over nothing and ends up killing herself. &quot;--- A  reviewer on Amazon of &quot;The Hours&quot;.SOMEONE didn't do their homework. Does this reviewer realize that Virginia Woolf suffered from an acute mental illness that drove her to suicide?  This person needs to research these subjects a bit before ranting about them.&quot; I was sort of glad at the end of the movie that Kidman ends it all, she was so unredeeming and irritating at the end of the movie.&quot;- IbidYou mean, unredeemable  aside from being one of the great novelists of the twentieth century?  I found Kidman did an amazing job of portraying Virginia Woolf's more disturbed side... it's clear from the onset that she is NOT a fully functional woman (as anyone who has ever heard about Virginia Woolf would know that she was not), and that she has serious imbalance issues throughout the film. While she was at her most stable during the writing of &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;, it's quite clear that it just means that she wasn't suicidal-- her malady was such that it seemed to be almost permanently hanging over her head, her behaviour becoming so erratic at times that she was branded an &quot;eccentric&quot;. In fact, in the novel &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; the character of Septimus is diagnosed and treated pretty much like Virginia Woolf was herself treated. Chronic depresison or schizophrenia, whatever Mrs. Woolf suffered from, was something british society was not in condition or knowledge to treat back then. If you read Mrs. Dalloway, you'll find an echo of Mrs. Woolf's condition in the paragraphs where she enters Septimus' mind.

It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.The complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations. Based on a Michael Cunningham novel, ""The Hours"" combines a real life story (Virginia Woolf), a re-written one (Laura Brown's interpretation of ""Mrs. Dalloway"") and an original creation as well (Clarissa Vaughn). We get three different stories, each fascinating on its own edited together into a complex, intriguing drama that will have you in tears a couple of times before the ending credits start rolling.What glues the stories together is ""Mrs. Dalloway"" - the book. Virginia Woolf, a suicidal author in England (1923) creates the character, the novel inspires a lonely housewife in Los Angeles (1951) and a 'trivial' 2001 New York City gay woman is called ""Mrs. Dalloway"" by her dying friend who points out the similarities between them. Later on, we find out another connection between the characters. It's clear that the thoughts that have been put into this movie go beyond the screenplay and acting. Things like the settings & clothing for each story help compile a perfect, believable plot.However, what really left me with awe was the PHENOMENAL acting. Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film. She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century. Her performance allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.

591079,A1MC81HLJ6Z9ZQ,B00005JKTI,Paul McGrath,"[27, 44]","If you think about it, it was entirely predictable that Nicole Kidman would win the Academy Award for this.  No, not because her acting was anything special, but because she so determinedly changed her appearance:  dowdy dress, tin-man nose, etc. Hollywood may not know beans about acting, but it sure knows when a Glamorous Hollywood Star shows up in Frumpville--like fatso DeNiro in Raging Bull or trailer-trash Julia Roberts in the Bronkovich movie--and you can bet it will take notice.  What it didn't, unfortunately, notice, is that most of the big star's lines are delivered in monotone, except for the train station scene, in which she yelled a lot about wanting to go back to London.  London is where she tried to commit suicide in the first place, even though she now wants to commit suicide because she's AWAY from it . . . it's all so confusing.  But she's a tortured artist and all that and they are very difficult to understand.The Julianne Moore character is also a tortured something-or-other--maybe not an artist--but at least she wants to knock herself off.  This is apparently because her happy nitwit husband, played by John C. Reilly--who specializes in playing happy nitwit types that only exist in movies--is too much of a happy nitwit to notice she's losing her mind.  She has an adorable three year-old boy who clearly loves her but this is not enough to prevent her from leaving them both for good.  But not without first giving a lengthy, lingering kiss to her big-bosomed female neighbor, who's about to have her ovaries removed.  Ms. Moore did not get nominated for an Academy Award for this, maybe because she already got nominated for her role in Far From Heaven, a performance she faithfully reproduces here, the slight difference being that in that one she is happy and vacant, and in this one, unhappy and vacant.  She's got the vacant thing down to an art.Speaking of art, Meryl Streep is one of Our Greatest Actresses and she certainly proves it, chewing the scenery and clawing the walls and even looking around for a chandelier to hang from but unfortunately there wasn't any around.  This is a very meaty role and demanding of such talent.  You see, Ms. Streep's character's gay ex-husband is dying of AIDS and wouldn't you know, HE'S a tortured artist also, and obviously, a brilliant one.  In Hollywood, naturally, all Tortured Gay Artists With AIDS are brilliant, but just so we don't miss the point, we get to see his 800 page behemoth of a book bandied about a couple of times and it's just a shame that the restrictions of the medium didn't give the filmmakers a chance to hit the audience over the head with it.But poor Ms. Streep has problems of her own, in that her gay ex-husband does not want to cooperate with her efforts to throw him an artist-type party, wanting to throw instead himself out of his window in a melancholy and melodramatic way.  Or maudlin maybe.  How about a melodramatic, maudlin, melancholy suicide?  In any event she also has started to question the ten year relationship she has had with HER girlfriend, who is of course a sincere, sensitive and understanding type, as all lesbians are.The movie did get one thing right, which is when the ex-boyfriend of the gay ex-husband shows up, and announces that San Francisco isn't the mecca of happiness and well-being that he expected it to be.  In fact, he makes a rather disparaging comment about this fine city, which, with its legions of mendicants roaming about urinating on its streets, seems appropriate.",1,High Art and Hollywood Icons,1057708800,"07 9, 2003",2003,3527,"['think', 'was', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'would', 'win', 'Academy', 'Award', 'No', 'not', 'acting', 'was', 'anything', 'special', 'so', 'determinedly', 'changed', 'appearance', 'dowdy', 'dress', 'tin-man', 'nose', 'etc', 'Hollywood', 'may', 'not', 'know', 'beans', 'acting', 'sure', 'when', 'Glamorous', 'Hollywood', 'Star', 'up', 'Frumpville', 'fatso', 'DeNiro', 'Raging', 'Bull', 'trailer-trash', 'Julia', 'Roberts', 'Bronkovich', 'movie', 'can', 'bet', 'will', 'take', 'notice', 'What', 'did', ""n't"", 'unfortunately', 'notice', 'most', 'big', 'star', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'monotone', 'train', 'station', 'scene', 'yelled', 'lot', 'wanting', 'go', 'back', 'London', 'London', 'where', 'tried', 'commit', 'suicide', 'first', 'place', 'even', 'now', 'commit', 'suicide', 'AWAY', 'so', 'confusing', 'tortured', 'artist', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'understand.The', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'character', 'also', 'tortured', 'something-or-other', 'maybe', 'not', 'artist', 'least', 'knock', 'off', 'apparently', 'happy', 'nitwit', 'husband', 'played', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'who', 'playing', 'happy', 'nitwit', 'types', 'only', 'exist', 'movies', 'too', 'much', 'happy', 'nitwit', 'notice', 'losing', 'mind', 'adorable', 'three', 'year-old', 'boy', 'who', 'clearly', 'not', 'enough', 'prevent', 'leaving', 'good', 'not', 'first', 'giving', 'lengthy', 'lingering', 'kiss', 'big-bosomed', 'female', 'neighbor', 'who', 'have', 'ovaries', 'removed', 'Ms.', 'Moore', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Award', 'maybe', 'already', 'got', 'nominated', 'role', 'Far', 'From', 'Heaven', 'performance', 'faithfully', 'here', 'slight', 'difference', 'being', 'one', 'happy', 'vacant', 'one', 'unhappy', 'vacant', 'got', 'vacant', 'thing', 'down', 'art.Speaking', 'art', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'one', 'Greatest', 'Actresses', 'certainly', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'clawing', 'walls', 'even', 'looking', 'around', 'chandelier', 'hang', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'around', 'very', 'meaty', 'role', 'demanding', 'such', 'talent', 'see', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'character', 'gay', 'ex-husband', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'would', ""n't"", 'know', 'HE', 'tortured', 'artist', 'also', 'obviously', 'brilliant', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'naturally', 'Tortured', 'Gay', 'AIDS', 'are', 'brilliant', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'point', 'get', 'see', '800', 'page', 'behemoth', 'book', 'bandied', 'couple', 'times', 'just', 'shame', 'restrictions', 'medium', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'filmmakers', 'chance', 'hit', 'audience', 'head', 'it.But', 'poor', 'Ms.', 'Streep', 'problems', 'own', 'gay', 'ex-husband', 'not', 'want', 'cooperate', 'efforts', 'throw', 'artist-type', 'party', 'wanting', 'throw', 'instead', 'window', 'melancholy', 'melodramatic', 'way', 'maudlin', 'maybe', 'How', 'melodramatic', 'maudlin', 'melancholy', 'suicide', 'event', 'also', 'started', 'question', 'ten', 'year', 'relationship', 'had', 'HER', 'girlfriend', 'who', 'course', 'sincere', 'sensitive', 'understanding', 'type', 'are.The', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'one', 'thing', 'right', 'when', 'ex-boyfriend', 'gay', 'ex-husband', 'up', 'announces', 'San', 'Francisco', ""n't"", 'mecca', 'happiness', 'well-being', 'expected', 'be', 'fact', 'rather', 'disparaging', 'comment', 'fine', 'city', 'legions', 'mendicants', 'roaming', 'urinating', 'streets', 'appropriate']",The Hours

I might be in the minority here, but as I watched it I could not help but feel that I had somehow tuned into a bad, boring Lifetime made for TV movie. I kept expecting Judith Light or Shanon Doherty to appear.  The performances were not compelling, and I can't for the life of me understand how Kidman received such priase for this yawner.  I guess if you stick a big piece of bubblegum in the tip of your nose, ugly yourself up a bit, that becomes award winning acting.  I know I should have felt something for the three women in this story... If not completely understand their pain and struggles, at least acknowledge it.  But, I felt nothing.  Actually, that is not entirely true.  I did feel something...frustrated.  For 2 hours I felt the frustration at these 3 actresses on the screen.  In the end, I was only too happy that it was over.  It is a film that really leaves you feeling empty.  This is not because the performances were so engrossing that you feel the emptiness and pain in these women's lives.  No, you feel empty because you sat dopwn to watch a great movie, and instead witnessed some mediocre movie of the week hogwash.

Then there's Julianne Moore playing Laura Brown, a repressed, depressed, and frustrated suburban mom during the 40s (and her very frightened, preternaturally `aware' young son) who begins reading Mrs. Dalloway and starts to question her own life and its goals - and wonders if it's really worth going on. And then, in modern-day NYC, there's Clarissa (named for the title role in Mrs. Dalloway and played by the incomparable Meryl Streep) acting out the book itself as she buys flowers and plans a celebratory party for her friend and former lover, played by Richard Harris, who is dying of AIDs.It's a convoluted movie, and while we can easily make the connection between Virginia Woolf's life and Clarissa's NY life, Laura Brown's place in this trio is unclear until the very end, when everything ties together so beautifully that it leaves you breathless.See it now.

I didn't find the courage to watch it until recently because many of my friends either despised it or that they left the cinema early not knowing how to watch it.  I know this sounds silly, watching a movie is simply sit and watch but everyone's thought process is different and work on different levels.  I'm sure that people would appreciate the beauty of this movie would not tolerate the crassness of JackAss the movie, that's for sure!  I find the Hours akin to a musical composition; it is moving with the rhythmical precision of a well-composed piece where everything fit together nicely to give us a coherent cacophony of sound.  I find it absorbing to sit through additional features such as Michael Cunningham (the author)'s talk on this Pulitzer winning book, of how he came out with the idea of writing about the lives of three women: the author, the character, and the reader.  The talks continued about the David Hare's involvement in the script, Director's decision of the choice of his casting, the difficulty that he faced in the making of this film, documentaries about Virginia Woolf, Mrs Dalloway, the character that Virginia created.  Even the title of ""The Hours"" meant something.  Some of the things said in the movie lingered on even when the curtain drew to a close.  It's very profound when Virginia explained to her husband that sometimes, someone needed to die so that the living can appreciate and cherish their lives.  How true!  All three ladies in The Hours are deemed to be visionary, ahead of their times, not conventional in any sense of the word and because of that, their actions, things that they do are construed as out of ordinary.  As time moves on, history would judge them rather differently.  This movie is worth watching again in order to explore the many layers and depths that it contains.  For me, it's quite a journey.

(I was reminded of ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" also starring Meryl Streep, in which the lives of two women of different time periods are intertwined.)  It's one of those great concepts that didn't work out very well, in my opinion.  There's a lot of acting going on....Nicole Kidman, usually a fine actress,  wears a prosthetic nose and dowdy dresses and speaks in a throaty monotone which impressed a lot of people. (She won an Oscar for it) The film would have been better if we had seen some of the up side of Woolfe's character. Just the brown dumpy dress and cryptic comments didn't engage our interest. Creative genuises are interesting; mentally ill people are not.The two women whose lives are supposedly affected by VW's novel, Mrs, Dalloway, are even less sympathetic than VW.  Meryl Streep plays a woman whose life doesn't really make sense.  She apparently had a great love affair, when she was 18 with the Ed Harris character, who was 19, one summer.  Then, for reasons no one explains both become gay, yet Streep keeps hanging on to Harris and he declares his love for her, right before he tosses himself out of his window.  This is supposed to be high drama, apparently but it's really pretentious nonsense.  The Julianne Moore character, who is a replay of the woman she played in Far From Heaven, is so vacant that, again, it's really hard to care about her.  What's her problem?  She's in love with her neighbor? she hates her husband? she can't bake cakes?  Maybe the cake thing is supposed to be telling us that she feels trapped as a 50's housewife and so she escapes on a bus to Toronto to where she finds fulfillment as a librarian?  It's not convincing, whatever the message is supposed to be. .I usually love Meryl Streep's performances. She has the ability to disappear into her character better than almost anyone else I've seen.  But here...all I could see was Meryl emoting. It was annoyning.  Was it bad direction?  Likewise the wonderful Ed Harris. Egad!  What a waste of talent.Many people will be impressed because they think they should be.  After all it's about Virginia Woolfe!

He never stays too long with one woman, knowing the exact moment to switch to another story. But each story is fully engaging, drawing you in.Equally as astounding, if not more so, is the superb acting by each and every actor. If anyone stands it, though, it would be Kidman. She absolutely becomes Virginia Wolfe in a restrained, sorrowful way. She deserves the best actress win here. Moore and Streep also give powerhouse performances, but Ed Harris's magnificent supporting role as an AIDS stricken man is as astounding as Kidman's. His physical transformation is astounding in itself. John C. Reilly also turns in a good performance as Moore's disillusioned husband, but no one performs less then amazingly.The subject matter may be a downer, but that doesn't make the film any less perfect. How it deals with sadness and the desire for happiness is realistic for many people experiencing depression. The world we live in is far from perfect, and this film shows how if we're not careful, it can bring us down in despair.The Hours is a rare, wonderful film that deserves any awards it gets Oscar night.

591089,AUA64NQ3X56OJ,B00005JKTI,Richard Nelson,"[4, 6]","Rare is the film in which you've heard of almost everyone in it. Like Gosford Park --similarly robbed with a single Oscar in 2001's competition--this film assembles the talent needed to bring a difficult script to life.Weaving three stories together is a deft feat, accomplished here by connecting the stories with the ties that bind them. These include the party each of the three main characters plans to host on the day in which the film takes place, the same-sex kiss each shares before the day is out, and Mrs. Dalloway , the Virginia Woolf novel that one character is writing, one is reading, and one is living. Also instrumental in keeping the flow of the movie going is a superb score by minimalist Philip Glass.It's the acting that really shines, though. Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep earn our empathy in every scene, radiating their feelings above and beyond the carefully crafted script. Kidman's scowling Woolf, battling husband Stephen Dillane for the right to control her own troubled existence, is as believable a tortured genius as can be imagined, outshining even Russell Crowe's portrayal of John Nash. Moore's '50s housewife hides the pain of her discontent from her husband--an excellent John C. Reilly--but not from us. Streep's face telegraphs her joy at buying the flowers for her party and her guilty dismay when Ed Harris scolds her for living to throw it.Still, why should you watch a movie about three women in the throes of crisis? Because the film conveys at least two messages of profound importance. The first is that happiness is not to be taken for granted. As Streep lies on her bed, talking to daughter Claire Danes, she recalls the day, long ago, when she awoke at dawn from a night spent with Harris, before both embarked on lives with same-sex partners. She felt such possibility, such joy--the beginning, she thought, of happiness. But that was happiness, she now knows. She should have known it then. She should have understood it sooner. She's been trapped in that moment ever since, looking down a road never taken, rueing the brambles that have long since overgrown it. She should have been living the life she's got.The second message is that things are getting better. The three stories carry across four generations. In the first, Virginia Woolf kisses her sister in desperation at her situation. Miranda Richardson's reaction is a fit of hysterics, and she flees to London. In the second, Moore's housewife kisses neighbor Toni Collette to comfort her about an impending medical procedure that threatens her womanhood. Collette partakes, then pretends it didn't happen. In the third, Streep kisses lover-of-ten-years Allison Janney passionately, seeming to acknowledge in a moment Janney's years of living in the shadows of a memory and renewing a relationship that seemed troubled as the film opened. Danes gives a hug filled with forgiveness whose significance, in my opinion, outweighs all three kisses, showing that the next iteration of the story can contain not only a modicum of happiness but also forgiveness for those who suffered through the stories of the past and couldn't quite cope.The Hours begins and ends with a suicide, with another in the middle for good measure. Yet it affirms the value of life, of moving on, of progress, of the notion that tomorrow will be better. It is a movie of depth and ideas. If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out on one of the decade's most profound cinematic achievements.",5,Brilliant and timely,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,3494,"['Rare', 'film', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'almost', 'everyone', 'Gosford', 'Park', 'similarly', 'robbed', 'single', 'Oscar', '2001', 'competition', 'film', 'talent', 'needed', 'bring', 'difficult', 'script', 'life.Weaving', 'three', 'stories', 'together', 'deft', 'feat', 'accomplished', 'here', 'connecting', 'stories', 'ties', 'bind', 'include', 'party', 'three', 'main', 'characters', 'plans', 'host', 'day', 'film', 'place', 'same-sex', 'kiss', 'shares', 'day', 'out', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'novel', 'one', 'character', 'writing', 'one', 'reading', 'one', 'living', 'Also', 'instrumental', 'keeping', 'flow', 'movie', 'going', 'superb', 'score', 'minimalist', 'Philip', 'Glass.It', 'acting', 'really', 'though', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'earn', 'empathy', 'scene', 'radiating', 'feelings', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'script', 'Kidman', 'scowling', 'Woolf', 'battling', 'husband', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'right', 'control', 'own', 'troubled', 'existence', 'believable', 'tortured', 'genius', 'can', 'be', 'imagined', 'outshining', 'even', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'portrayal', 'John', 'Nash', 'Moore', ""'50s"", 'housewife', 'pain', 'discontent', 'husband', 'excellent', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'not', 'Streep', 'face', 'telegraphs', 'joy', 'buying', 'flowers', 'party', 'guilty', 'dismay', 'when', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'living', 'throw', 'it.Still', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'movie', 'three', 'women', 'throes', 'crisis', 'film', 'conveys', 'least', 'two', 'messages', 'profound', 'importance', 'first', 'happiness', 'not', 'be', 'taken', 'granted', 'Streep', 'lies', 'bed', 'talking', 'daughter', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'day', 'long', 'ago', 'when', 'awoke', 'dawn', 'night', 'spent', 'Harris', 'embarked', 'lives', 'same-sex', 'partners', 'felt', 'such', 'possibility', 'such', 'joy', 'beginning', 'thought', 'happiness', 'was', 'happiness', 'now', 'should', 'have', 'known', 'then', 'should', 'have', 'understood', 'sooner', 'been', 'trapped', 'moment', 'ever', 'looking', 'down', 'road', 'never', 'taken', 'rueing', 'brambles', 'have', 'long', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'living', 'life', 'got.The', 'second', 'message', 'things', 'are', 'getting', 'better', 'three', 'stories', 'carry', 'four', 'generations', 'first', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'sister', 'desperation', 'situation', 'Miranda', 'Richardson', 'reaction', 'fit', 'hysterics', 'London', 'second', 'Moore', 'housewife', 'neighbor', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'comfort', 'impending', 'medical', 'procedure', 'womanhood', 'Collette', 'partakes', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'happen', 'third', 'Streep', 'kisses', 'lover-of-ten-years', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'passionately', 'seeming', 'acknowledge', 'moment', 'Janney', 'years', 'living', 'shadows', 'memory', 'renewing', 'relationship', 'seemed', 'troubled', 'film', 'opened', 'Danes', 'hug', 'filled', 'forgiveness', 'significance', 'opinion', 'three', 'kisses', 'showing', 'next', 'iteration', 'story', 'can', 'contain', 'not', 'only', 'modicum', 'happiness', 'also', 'forgiveness', 'who', 'suffered', 'stories', 'past', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'cope.The', 'Hours', 'begins', 'suicide', 'middle', 'good', 'measure', 'value', 'life', 'moving', 'progress', 'notion', 'tomorrow', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'movie', 'depth', 'ideas', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'yet', ""'re"", 'missing', 'out', 'one', 'decade', 'most', 'profound', 'cinematic', 'achievements']",The Hours

591091,A2PPTN3DTD8QNW,B00005JKTI,Rich Grace,"[22, 40]","We wanted to give this film a chance. The Hours got great reviews, and both of us had read a couple of Virginia Woolf's novels in past periods of our lives. My problems with this film are three:1) The cast is overwhelming. It's like a jazz band with too many soloists and not enough rhythm backup. Many supporting roles amount to cameos for actors who are capable of carrying other films. It becomes an exercise for the viewer of ""oh, hey, I remember them in...."" which in the end is a distraction. Also, each supporting player works so hard to make an impact in their short screen time that everyone just winds up sounding hysterical.2)  Ed Harris as an AIDS victim? Uh huh. Nice try. A classic case of miscasting, and scenery chewing by an actor who should know better. Obnoxious.3) An incredibly self-regarding, pretentious screenplay. The relentless degeneration among all of these materially very well-off characters is just completely implausible. NO ONE ever laughs. No one ever seems to even appreciate being alive, or take any pleasure in anything whatsoever. There is never a thematic break that allows the audience to see something positive - to give the viewer a break. Tragedy is best illustrated by also illuminating what was good about the protagonist. Shakespeare saw this, particularly in Othello. This movie does not, and fatally hamstrings itself.The sadness of Virginia Woolf I can understand - but the Streep and Moore characters are beyond plausible. The movie continually grabs you by the lapels and DEMANDS that you appreciate the terrible psychological dilemmas facing these rich Yuppies.After somewhere around an hour of this bathetic lachrymatory, we pulled the disc out and said, ""well, THAT was a waste of time....""

Virginia Woolf as she writes Mrs Dalloway. Laura Brown as she reads the novel during her 2nd pregnancy, troubled deeply by feelings of both depression and worthlessness. And Richard Brown, her son, his friends and the last day of his life.It is the story of 1 day in the lives of 3 people. Told in surprising detail and richness, but initially a bit confusing and demands a half an hour or so of quiet resignation to get all the pieces together.Curiously, i found looking back at what i thought the movie was doing a nice lesson/exercise itself. The point of the movie has to do with happiness, how fleeding it is, yet how important each day is, not just in retrospect but as you are living it.

The movie is an emotionally draining experience that works on many levels, acting, especially Nicole Kidman who provides a quite stunning performance, make-up, Ed Harris really does look like he has Aids, sets, fifties Los Angeles with all the cars they had to find and the English countryside looks like the English countryside, costumes, dialogue, music, lighting, it all blends together so perfectly.But what really made this a great buy for me were the extras on this disc.  From past experience I find a lot of this stuff on DVDs not really worth watching (and certainly not more than once) but Hours has some fascinating material.  The commentaries by director Daldry and novelist Cunningham gave me interesting insights into what they were trying to do with the movie, on screen commentaries by the three leading ladies were equally as interesting.  There is an excellent thirty-minute documentary about Virginia Woolf and three other features, which perfectly complements the movie.  Composer Philip Glass gets his chance too.

591097,A37S3ACL57LN62,B00005JKTI,"Samantha Glasser ""Maliejandra""","[10, 16]","The story is told in three different time periods. First is the story of Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), a writer who feels trapped in her own mind and in the retraints of the world around her. Next is Laura Brown(Julianne Moore), a woman of the 1950s who is reading Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. She too feels trapped in her daily life. She is a failure as a woman because she cannot do the mundane things a housewife is expected to do like bake a cake. Last is Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who is planning a party for her writer friend that is dying of AIDs (Ed Harris). A theme of the film besides hating life is lesbianism, a contributor to the sentiment of entrapment.The problem with the film is that the characters are next to impossible to relate to or to sympathize with. Each of them inflict themselves with their pain. Each act with no regard for the people around them. Their problems seem whiney and selfish as a result.Marlene Dietrich was right in her assumptions about the Academy Awards and who wins them. She claimed that when an actress played an invalid, a person with a mental illness, or an ugly person, the actress was assured an Oscar. This prediction has come true with Kidman. The extent of her performance is staring into the distance with a cigarette in her mouth and one minor outburst with her husband.This is hardly an interesting movie; it drags slowly to peak with a predictable and forced climax.

591098,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B00005JKTI,Samuel McKewon,"[24, 30]","More intense and focused than the book that inspires it, ""The Hours"" has the presence of a gathering, angry storm, manifested in three women whose convictions, desires and wills do not entirely match, yet all find themselves wondering if their lives could have or should have more to them than they do.Nicole Kidman is the standout as Virginia Woolf, the early 20th Century British novelist both ahead of and trapped by her era, embarking upon writing her book,  ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" which she believes will fully distinguish her genius. Julianne Moore is Laura Brown, a 1950s  Florida housewife reading the book and attempting to prepare a proper birthday cake for her husband. Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn, who intends to throw a party for a friend dying of AIDS (Ed Harris) as he's about to receive the Carrothers Prize for poetry.Director Stephen Daldry plays up the parallels of the three women, much as Michael Cunningham did in the book. In the compressed universe of a movie, these parallels are more obvious, and at times intrusive on the story, as Daldry seems to need to point and nod at his stylistic flourishes (See the flowers? Notice the dialogue?) to a point reaching irritation.But the performances carry the movie past the indulgences.  Kidman, as Woolf, stalks her brooding scenes as if she's in her final role -- Daldry likes how Kidman smokes a cigarette so much, he shows it several times. Kidman, with a prosthetic nose plastered on to complete the character's transformation, holds her cards close -- Woolf is brilliant, and slightly mad, and good at concealing her moods -- until a late, angry scene at a train station, as she attempts to flee her rural England home for London, a main source of her madness. Kidman controls this performance; it doesn't get away from her like Alice Harford did in ""Eyes Wide Shut."" She's outstanding.Moore and Streep, obviously, inhabit smaller roles. Between the two, Moore has to work harder to make us believe her housewife is teetering so much on the edge of things that she's prone to crack. I'm not sure she gets there; she doesn't have enough time to develop Laura Brown's quirks, and what time she does have she underplays.Streep has her own troubles, playing Clarissa, a fiftyish lesbian -- methinks Streep doesn't exude ""lesbian,"" hence, this aspect of Clarissa is downplayed -- who very well could have lived an entire life with her friend Richard (Harris), a brooding, mercurial genius not unlike Woolf, who once kissed Clarissa on a sand dune near the ocean and defined her one moment of pure happiness.  What I love about Streep is her willingness to let others chew the scenery -- she's a cheery team player for a superstar, ain't she? -- and boy, does Ed Harris gnaw away.What the hell's gotten into this man? Five years ago, he was slogging around in ""Milk Money"" and hamming it up in ""Stepmom."" Now, with this performance and his tour de force work in ""Pollock,"" he's redefining anger mismanagement. Harris has two extended scenes, and it's all he needs to put a sad, cruel stamp on the whole movie, like Woolf, his mind is a caged animal, bound up in ways by AIDS in he can never shake loose. You might remember him more than any of the women.Inevitably, you compare the movie to the book. Daldry's version --- my guess is this kind of movie can and will be remade a different way -- holds up. Cunningham, in the novel, allows himself the ability to rustle through the minds of his characters -- all of them -- whenever he sees fit; one of the great triumphs of the book is that he keeps the reader on a clear and straight path through all the shifting perspectives. Although it contains suicides, the novel's pervading emotion is of fleeting sadness, or, in some cases regret. Daldry cranks up those emotions into a stiffer drink; an early scene with Clarissa in the flower shop, which passes without much incidence in the book, is an opportunity for Daldry in the movie to convey heavy tension. To his credit, Daldry isn't fearful to become less-than-elegant and press his camera into these women's faces. And what few special effects there are work nicely. In the end, Daldry respected the pedigree of his actresses and the novelist but worked them over a little, too, and the end result is unsettling and dramatic.It was a mature, intelligent picture. It brought me to read the book, which I think might supplement the movie better than the movie would supplement the book. The book fills in the remaining blanks, but the meat of the book's power is right there on the screen.""The Hours"" won't let you down.",4,An emotional cauldron of great performances and filmmaking,1050537600,"04 17, 2003",2003,4588,"['More', 'intense', 'focused', 'book', 'Hours', 'presence', 'gathering', 'angry', 'storm', 'manifested', 'three', 'women', 'convictions', 'desires', 'wills', 'do', 'not', 'entirely', 'match', 'yet', 'find', 'wondering', 'lives', 'could', 'have', 'should', 'have', 'more', 'do.Nicole', 'Kidman', 'standout', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'early', '20th', 'Century', 'British', 'novelist', 'ahead', 'trapped', 'era', 'embarking', 'writing', 'book', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'will', 'fully', 'distinguish', 'genius', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Laura', 'Brown', '1950s', 'Florida', 'housewife', 'reading', 'book', 'attempting', 'prepare', 'proper', 'birthday', 'cake', 'husband', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'who', 'throw', 'party', 'friend', 'dying', 'AIDS', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'receive', 'Carrothers', 'Prize', 'poetry.Director', 'Stephen', 'Daldry', 'up', 'parallels', 'three', 'women', 'much', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'did', 'book', 'compressed', 'universe', 'movie', 'parallels', 'are', 'more', 'obvious', 'times', 'intrusive', 'story', 'Daldry', 'need', 'point', 'nod', 'stylistic', 'flourishes', 'See', 'flowers', 'Notice', 'dialogue', 'point', 'reaching', 'performances', 'carry', 'movie', 'indulgences', 'Kidman', 'Woolf', 'brooding', 'scenes', 'final', 'role', 'Daldry', 'how', 'Kidman', 'cigarette', 'so', 'much', 'several', 'times', 'Kidman', 'prosthetic', 'nose', 'plastered', 'complete', 'character', 'transformation', 'cards', 'close', 'Woolf', 'brilliant', 'slightly', 'mad', 'good', 'concealing', 'moods', 'late', 'angry', 'scene', 'train', 'station', 'flee', 'rural', 'England', 'home', 'London', 'main', 'source', 'madness', 'Kidman', 'performance', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'like', 'Alice', 'Harford', 'did', 'Eyes', 'Wide', 'Shut', 'outstanding.Moore', 'Streep', 'obviously', 'inhabit', 'smaller', 'roles', 'two', 'Moore', 'work', 'harder', 'make', 'believe', 'housewife', 'teetering', 'so', 'much', 'edge', 'things', 'prone', 'crack', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'there', ""n't"", 'have', 'enough', 'time', 'develop', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'quirks', 'what', 'time', 'have', 'underplays.Streep', 'own', 'troubles', 'playing', 'Clarissa', 'fiftyish', 'lesbian', 'methinks', 'Streep', ""n't"", 'exude', 'lesbian', 'hence', 'aspect', 'Clarissa', 'downplayed', 'who', 'very', 'well', 'could', 'have', 'lived', 'entire', 'life', 'friend', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'brooding', 'mercurial', 'genius', 'not', 'Woolf', 'who', 'once', 'kissed', 'Clarissa', 'sand', 'dune', 'ocean', 'defined', 'one', 'moment', 'pure', 'happiness', 'What', 'love', 'Streep', 'willingness', 'let', 'others', 'chew', 'scenery', 'cheery', 'team', 'player', 'superstar', 'ai', ""n't"", 'boy', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'gnaw', 'hell', 'gotten', 'man', 'Five', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'slogging', 'around', 'Milk', 'Money', 'hamming', 'up', 'Stepmom', 'Now', 'performance', 'tour', 'force', 'work', 'Pollock', 'redefining', 'anger', 'mismanagement', 'Harris', 'two', 'extended', 'scenes', 'all', 'put', 'sad', 'cruel', 'stamp', 'whole', 'movie', 'Woolf', 'mind', 'caged', 'animal', 'bound', 'up', 'ways', 'AIDS', 'can', 'never', 'shake', 'loose', 'might', 'remember', 'more', 'women.Inevitably', 'compare', 'movie', 'book', 'Daldry', 'version', 'guess', 'kind', 'movie', 'can', 'will', 'be', 'remade', 'different', 'way', 'up', 'Cunningham', 'novel', 'ability', 'rustle', 'minds', 'characters', 'fit', 'one', 'great', 'triumphs', 'book', 'reader', 'clear', 'straight', 'path', 'shifting', 'perspectives', 'suicides', 'novel', 'pervading', 'emotion', 'fleeting', 'sadness', 'cases', 'regret', 'Daldry', 'up', 'emotions', 'stiffer', 'drink', 'early', 'scene', 'Clarissa', 'flower', 'shop', 'much', 'incidence', 'book', 'opportunity', 'Daldry', 'movie', 'convey', 'heavy', 'tension', 'credit', 'Daldry', ""n't"", 'fearful', 'become', 'less-than-elegant', 'press', 'camera', 'women', 'what', 'few', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'work', 'nicely', 'end', 'Daldry', 'respected', 'pedigree', 'actresses', 'novelist', 'worked', 'over', 'little', 'too', 'end', 'result', 'unsettling', 'dramatic.It', 'was', 'mature', 'intelligent', 'picture', 'brought', 'read', 'book', 'think', 'might', 'supplement', 'movie', 'better', 'movie', 'would', 'supplement', 'book', 'book', 'remaining', 'blanks', 'meat', 'book', 'power', 'right', 'there', 'screen', 'Hours', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'down']",The Hours

But in general, what I found lacking in the movie, was that it hardly varies in its moods.  Minute after minute the viewer is beset by anguish, angst, anguish, repression, anxiety, angst...  not to mention utter selfishness and impulsivity.  I'm not asking for outright comedy or a song-and-dance routine, but something that provides some contrast to the general mood of quiet despair, and something that contributes genuine reflection on the characters' actions.

591104,A2B7BUH8834Y6M,B00005JKTI,"Shelley Gammon ""Geek""","[39, 52]","While this movie is a multi-layered masterpiece, viewers must be warned - you will be depressed. Even if you are the happiest go-lucky person before you walk in, you will feel a malaise when you walk out of the theater.  Anyone who is clinically depressed or has thoughts of suicide should not see this movie.  Many disturbing themes are interwoven into the story: depression, suicide attempts, suicide, abandonment, sexual identity confusion and persistent loneliness.That being said, the acting is superb and the film is a masterful work and a great movie to study for aspiring filmmakers, actors and directors. Nicole Kidman's role tends to get the most attention due to the prothsetic nose she wears - but all the actors, from the youngest child on up are at the top of their game.In the final months of her life, Virginia Woolf wrote the story of ""Mrs. Dalloway,"" a lonely housefrau who eventually takes her life and surprised everyone... because she did it ""for no reason.""  Her novel reveals much of her inner turmoil - that she is a person that can be understood by no one, not even herself. Her depression so consumes her, that she cannot see clear from it. More than just consistantly mopey, she is almost devoid of any emotions, but when her emotions peak, they are of loneliness and sadness. She experiences guilt for the emotional baggage she has thrown into the lap of her husband and has such a low self-esteem that she lets her housekeepers openly mock her.The film shifts forward and back in time - opening w/ Woolf's suicide, then jumping to 1951, where Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a lonley housefrau herself, reading Woolf's novel.  The film then moves to 2001 with an equally lonely divorcee, now lesbian, who is such the embodiment of Woolf's depressed character that her best friend refers to her as ""Mrs. Dalloway.""  Ed Harris plays her best friend and ex-lover who is in the final stages of full-blown AIDS.  He, too, struggles with loneliness and depression, as most of his so-called friends have abandoned him to his terminal illness.The theme that each person is an island and that we all truly die alone is persistent throughout.Like Woolf (who was sexually abused as a child by her own step brothers), all the principal characters have major sexual identity issues. They do not know whether they are gay, straight or just asexual... and this causes some extremely awkward scenes that will make you squirm in your seat. They all behave as though they do not fit in their own bodies. While they know how to ""play the game"" to fit in with ""normal"" society, they are alien to it and play with the though of death as the ""great escape"" from the prison of what their lives have become.This is a superb film, but  it is an experience that is not for the faint of heart.  Those who have lost a loved one to suicide will find no solace in this story, and those who are suffering from depression should avoid it altogether.  As someone who is not suffering from depression, I walked out of the movie feeling like a wet dish rag.Fans of Kidman, Moore and Streep will not be disappointed. Toni Collette's performance, while brief, is also powerful.

591107,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00005JKTI,S. Schell,"[4, 9]","The Academy Awards has done it again.  Take an obscure picture about a simple subject, bequeath it with several nominations from the major categories (Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Director), smother every movie trailer that airs on TV with propaganda (complete with rave quotes from magazines and newspapers) and everyone will feel compelled to rush out and see it.The aftermath?  Most people are incredulous that they spent $8 on something they wouldn&#65533;t have looked at twice at their local Blockbuster.&#65533;The Hours&#65533; has relied on the glitter of marketing since it opened nationwide in January 2003 and it takes advantage of every favorable critique it receives.  The result is a continued and reliable box office profit that will persevere through late March if it manages to win a few Oscars.The movie begins with a simultaneous look at the morning routines of the three pivotal characters &#65533; first off, in the year 1921, novelist Virginia Woolf (Kidman) awakens in her Richmond, England home to the sound of her doctor whispering to her husband Leonard (Dillane) downstairs.  The next clip takes place thirty years later in 1951 with pregnant housewife Laura Brown (Moore) sleeping soundly as her husband Dan (Reilly) roots around the kitchen.  Lastly, in the year 2001, Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) slaps her alarm clock with a heavy hand as she rises from bed, planning an extravagant dinner party for her friend Richard (Harris) who has just won a prestigious award for his latest novel.  All three women wrestle their inner demons throughout the film, Woolf battling schizophrenia; Brown, dissatisfaction with her cursory and monotonous life and Vaughn with her feelings toward Richard, tortured by the reality that he will soon die from a long, arduous battle with AIDS.The entire film alternates between the different eras in which these women live, forming interesting parallels as aspects of their personalities and lives are revealed.  Woolf writes her pivotal novel &#65533;Mrs. Dalloway&#65533; while contemplating thoughts of suicide, Brown reads &#65533;Mrs. Dalloway&#65533; and also contemplates suicide and Vaughn&#65533;s life seems to mirror the book altogether, the start of her day echoing the very first line of Woolf&#65533;s novel.The biggest setback with David Hare&#65533;s screenplay (who has only written for the stage and TV) is not only loss of characterization but also a distinct amount of insight into the characters&#65533; psychological dissension.  The adaptation of Pulitzer-prize winning author Michael Cunningham&#65533;s 228-page novel to a two-hour film forfeits a considerable amount of poeticism and personification, a detail that most times cannot be avoided when adapting a book to a movie.  What is ultimately confusing is the homoeroticism incorporated into the story, Julianne Moore&#65533;s liplock with Toni Collette and Nicole Kidman&#65533;s passionate smooch with Miranda Richardson utterly perplexing.Most of Cunningham&#65533;s beautiful prose is retained in the story&#65533;s central figure - as Woolf, Kidman manipulates the pastoral dialogue with ease, her delivery rarely coming off as cliched or strained.  This is a high-caliber performance that not only well warrants her nomination for Best Actress this year but tops that of her nomination last year for &#65533;Moulin Rouge&#65533;.  Moore (also nominated) is slightly constricted as Laura Brown, her role more or less relegated to either holding back tears or letting them flow.  Streep, whom I adore, doesn&#65533;t really get a chance to showcase her awesome dramatic powers because the role of Clarissa Vaughn leaves her little of an outlet.  This is a woman who has been nominated thirteen times for an Academy Award (and has won twice for 1980&#65533;s &#65533;Kramer Vs. Kramer&#65533; and 1982&#65533;s &#65533;Sophie&#65533;s Choice&#65533;) and it&#65533;s a little disappointing that such incredible talents only receive a small degree of divulgence.  Ed Harris comes off a little inadequate as Richard &#65533; the most memorable aspect of his character is the incredible job the film&#65533;s make-up artists did in rendering an AIDS patient completely emaciated by the disease.  Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Allison Janney, Miranda Richardson and Stephen Dillane round out the supporting cast and Toni Collette, although making a very brief appearance as Brown&#65533;s neighbor Kitty, steals the scene with an affecting portrayal of a woman suppressing profuse heartache.Speaking of make-up, &#65533;The Hours&#65533; contains some subtle but remarkable transformations, most notably Ed Harris&#65533; haggard physique and Kidman&#65533;s transformation into the 40-something reclusive author.  Her prosthetic nose completely changes her physical countenance, rendering the actress nearly unrecognizable, along with her liver-spotted hands and arms.  Moore gets quite a transformation as well, her character showing up once more towards the end with a considerably aged face (60&#65533;s to 70&#65533;s, if I had to guess).Director Stephen Daldry, responsible for 2000&#65533;s cutesy critical fave &#65533;Billy Elliott&#65533;, is at the helm of the picture.  He presents &#65533;The Hours&#65533; in much the same manner as the classic novels of Woolf&#65533;s time &#65533; heavily laced with idyllic sentiment but languorously paced, at times to the point where it can exhaust the patience of more attentive people.  There are even moments where there is too much silence, Philip Glass&#65533;s lovely sonatas completely and utterly absent from the background; this is yet another aspect that can make people start shifting in their seats because the lack of a musical score can mean a failure to evoke a specific mood from its viewers.  Of course, for all I know, this could be Daldry&#65533;s very intention, the silence that all three women keep the very reason for their torment &#65533; we are meant to share their discomfort with the stillness to gain a small understanding of their anxiety.Although &#65533;The Hours&#65533; has a lot going for it (a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, an ensemble cast complete with Golden Globe/Emmy/Oscar winners), it has surprisingly little to flaunt in the end.  Despite the nine nominations it received from the Academy Awards, it is still just a trifle of a film.  If you want to watch a good examination piece, then rent 2000&#65533;s Best Picture winner &#65533;American Beauty&#65533; &#65533; Lester Burnham is the moot prophet of the 21st century.",3,Sullen

591108,A1O7OMW58QWG5K,B00005JKTI,Stacey Cochran,"[3, 5]","The Hours may be the best dramatic movie I've ever seen. I watched it last night at the AMC Ahwathuki 24 with my girlfriend. During the first twenty minutes two couples up front in the theater got up and left and I could only guess from their grumbling and non-verbal communication that they were not pleased with the film. They kind of derisively laughed at the screen. It's that kind of movie.At its core, The Hours is simply about a human being's capacity/incapacity to reciprocate love in the face of death. My girlfriend said she couldn't identify with any of the characters in the movie except Claire Dains because they mostly can *not* reciprocate love. Death is inevitable, so why give back love. I thought it was pretty callous and not true of her genuine character. My girlfriend and I talked about the film and our lives and ultimately I reminded her that she, too, felt that way once -- after her divorce -- she wanted to die, and no longer believed in love.It's a universal theme and in the case of Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore and Ed Harris's characters in the film, they represent an extreme -- they just can *not* give back love in the face of death. And ultimately this is not what most of us want to hear from a movie or a book. We want to know that people can triumph in the face of a day-to-day life that ends in death. To quit, simply doesn't make sense to a great many people (to the point of denying such despair could even be real), and that might be why people who feel negatively about The Hours do feel negatively.Meryl Streep's character is the most realized in that the character drawn for her *sees* both sides of the range (love in the face of death) and comes to some kind of affirming end. My own opinion is that the ending was the only place in the film that breeched being too melodramatic, but endings -- quite literally -- are difficult.I would absolutely love to see Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep in another film where they were actually on-screen together for more time. The final scene between them was so intense as to be palpable. They are simply two of the best actors I have ever seen. Nicole Kidman was so good I did not even recognize it was her playing Virginia Wolff for the first few minutes in the film.

However, what I found remarkable was the many ways David Hare's script and Roger Daldrey's direction managed to improve on Michael Cunningham's novel.  The novel, while good, was hampered by its somewhat clumsy attempt to rewrite Mrs. Dalloway.  I had the advantage of reading the novel right after reading Mrs. Dalloway, and Cunningham's novel reads as an interesting creative writing project, but a pale imitation of Woolf's stream-of-consciousness narrative technique.  The movie does a wonderful job of drawing the connections (what Daldrey calls ""leitmotifs"" in his and Cunningham's interesting commentary track) between the 3 central characters.  Daldrey's camera and Hare's script, combined with Philip Glass's score (which is so affecting it almost literally becomes a character in the story) combine to create an integrated effort of real beauty and honesty.  Daldrey's theater background allows him to do truly magical things with his actors, particularly the boy who plays Richie.  The only real criticism of the movie is that it goes for Hollywood-style dramatics in ""big"" scenes such as the Virginia-Leonard Woolf confrontation at the train station, which I think was more effectively underplayed in the novel.  Similarly, the idea that Laura Brown goes to the hotel with the intention of committing suicide is too heavy-handed compared with the more nuanced treatment of the same scene in the novel.  The little things here are done so effectively that the film maker's apparent need to give us audience-pleasing moments is a little unfortunate.  Meryl Streep's breakdown (invented by Hare) feels forced, like an Oscar clip.  The final passage, while beautifully written, is Hare's version of Woolf, which is a little audacious.  However, my relatively minor disagreements are far outweighed by the sensitivity and integrity put forth by Daldrey, Hare, Glass, and the entire cast.  The movie succeeds brilliantly in being 3 stories of depression that are never themselves depressing.  To the contrary, the movie contains an eloquent and emotionally persuasive argument for suicide as a way of living one's life with complete freedom.  It allows us to explore the remarkable notion that sadness is not only a part of life, but an experience that sharpens our appreciation for it, and its evental end.  It speaks to the sense that the experience of life can, if properly lived, reach to a place that is (in what may be Woolf's own phrase) beyond language.  The images, the music, the words, and the actors all work to get to that remarkable place.  To this extent, the movie is not only an improvement on the novel, but is an artistic and emotional triumph.",4,Novel into Film,1135468800,"12 25, 2005",2005,2801,"['Realizing', 'hundreds', 'reviews', 'have', 'been', 'written', 'space', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'new', 'original', 'can', 'add', 'However', 'what', 'found', 'remarkable', 'was', 'many', 'ways', 'David', 'Hare', 'script', 'Roger', 'Daldrey', 'direction', 'managed', 'improve', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'novel', 'novel', 'good', 'was', 'hampered', 'somewhat', 'clumsy', 'attempt', 'rewrite', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'had', 'advantage', 'reading', 'novel', 'right', 'reading', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'Cunningham', 'novel', 'reads', 'interesting', 'creative', 'writing', 'project', 'pale', 'imitation', 'Woolf', 'stream-of-consciousness', 'narrative', 'technique', 'movie', 'wonderful', 'job', 'drawing', 'connections', 'what', 'Daldrey', 'leitmotifs', 'Cunningham', 'interesting', 'commentary', 'track', '3', 'central', 'characters', 'Daldrey', 'camera', 'Hare', 'script', 'combined', 'Philip', 'Glass', 'score', 'so', 'affecting', 'almost', 'literally', 'character', 'story', 'combine', 'create', 'integrated', 'effort', 'real', 'beauty', 'honesty', 'Daldrey', 'theater', 'background', 'do', 'truly', 'magical', 'things', 'actors', 'particularly', 'boy', 'who', 'Richie', 'only', 'real', 'criticism', 'movie', 'Hollywood-style', 'dramatics', 'big', 'scenes', 'such', 'Virginia-Leonard', 'Woolf', 'confrontation', 'train', 'station', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'effectively', 'underplayed', 'novel', 'Similarly', 'idea', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'hotel', 'intention', 'committing', 'suicide', 'too', 'heavy-handed', 'compared', 'more', 'nuanced', 'treatment', 'same', 'scene', 'novel', 'little', 'things', 'here', 'are', 'done', 'so', 'effectively', 'film', 'maker', 'apparent', 'need', 'give', 'audience-pleasing', 'moments', 'little', 'unfortunate', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'breakdown', 'invented', 'Hare', 'feels', 'forced', 'Oscar', 'clip', 'final', 'passage', 'beautifully', 'written', 'Hare', 'version', 'Woolf', 'little', 'audacious', 'However', 'relatively', 'minor', 'disagreements', 'are', 'far', 'outweighed', 'sensitivity', 'integrity', 'put', 'forth', 'Daldrey', 'Hare', 'Glass', 'entire', 'cast', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'being', '3', 'stories', 'depression', 'are', 'never', 'depressing', 'contrary', 'movie', 'eloquent', 'emotionally', 'persuasive', 'argument', 'suicide', 'way', 'living', 'one', 'life', 'complete', 'freedom', 'explore', 'remarkable', 'notion', 'sadness', 'not', 'only', 'part', 'life', 'experience', 'appreciation', 'evental', 'end', 'sense', 'experience', 'life', 'can', 'properly', 'lived', 'reach', 'place', 'what', 'may', 'be', 'Woolf', 'own', 'phrase', 'language', 'images', 'music', 'words', 'actors', 'work', 'get', 'remarkable', 'place', 'extent', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'improvement', 'novel', 'artistic', 'emotional', 'triumph']",The Hours

And absolutely brilliant in the process of deconstruction it forces the viewer (or reader--I found it very true to the rhythm and depth of the book) to go through in order to reach the other side.There are moments in this film that I have thought about nearly every day since first seeing it in 2003, and it still comes up in conversation on a regular basis. I have, however, stopped recommending it to just anyone. I have found that many people are afraid to empathize with disturbed characters, or question their own morality and life choices. It is a matter of trust, I think, that when you get through it, you will have gained something of value.Particularly poignant for me was Julianne Moore's driving away scene. I think many of us grew up with distant or unhappy parents who felt that they were trapped and stunted, who wanted to be fully present, but weren't mentally able to be because they were wrestling invisible things we couldn't understand.I find inner journeys to be the most compelling, and being an audio learner, this was a beautiful movie to listen to as well.I know people get aggravated when pretty girls are cast to play plainer characters, but you have to give credit to Nicole Kidman for this one.

It reminded me of MAGNOLIA in the way it intertwined the stories together, and how they all came together. It was a very moving, powerful film with EXCELLENT performances. Nicole Kidman was AWESOME as Virginia Woolf and Julianne Moore was mesmerizing. Ed Harris was PERFECT in his role. It is a film that really makes you think, and as you're watching it, you realize that at one point in your life, you have felt like these characters before. I will end up buying this one, and now I want to read the book as well.2010 review:It is clear to me upon reading many of the comments on this site, that most of the viewers did not ""get"" this film. To fully grasp the themes of the film, it helps to have read both Woolf's ""Mrs. Dalloway"" and Cunningham's ""The Hours"" in order to understand the psychology of the characters and the reasoning behind their life choices. This film is more or less about three women from three different decades, who are sublimely unhappy with their lives, and who try to cope with that unhappiness through art and creativity. All the while, they seriously consider suicide as an end to their misery, but opt to stay alive to make others around them happy. Some survive this inner struggle, and some don't. Some will argue with the film's humanist worldview, but as far as I can tell, these emotions are real, these situations are real, and they happen every day. The Hours only brings those things to the light.Much has been made of the ""lesbian"" kissing scenes in the film. The viewers who have commented vehemently on these three instances have indeed taken it all out of context. These women so desperately want to make a connection with another human being, that the kisses aren't what they seem to be on the surface. They are not sexual, by any means. Yes, there are gay and lesbian characters in the film, but there are gay and lesbian people in life, as well.Every time I see this film, it's as though I see it through new eyes. I always gain a fresh perspective, and this has much to do with the fact that I am older, and have gained much more life experience than when I first saw the film years ago. Everything about the film bursts with life, from the beautiful cinematography, to the acting, the Philip Glass' beautiful score. There is also an unexpected scene of forgiveness that is truly touching.You should come away from this film a little more enlightened than you were before, that is, if you are willing to go there...and it always helps to read the books beforehand to gain a fuller experience. Those who have claimed that the film is about ""nothing"" are dead wrong. This film works on so many levels.

Thankfully, in the hands of writer David Hare and director Stephen Daldry, it's an emotional powerhouse that enthralls from opening to final frame.  Adapting novels, especially award-winning literary ones, is a challenging business.  But David Hare's wonderful screenplay grabs the bull by the horns, boldly re-imagining whole sections of the book and creating action where there was once only interiority.  Moving seamlessly between three time periods, he delicately interweaves the emotional lives of three women.  But nothing is forced; his writing allows the connections to declare themselves, rather than making them obvious.  Such subtlety is helped enormously by the superb performances Daldry extracts from the actors.  This is truly an actor's movie, and it's blessed with an extraordinary cast.  Nicole Kidman has been the focus of most of the publicity and Oscar-mongering, but don't let that fool you.  Julianne Moore deserves the Supporting Actress award, too.  Meryl Streep is, as always, effortlessly perfect.  Ed Harris has never been better.  Even the minor plays - Toni Collette, Miranda Richardson, John C. Reilly and especially Stephen Dillane as the saintly Leonard Woolf - are superb.  Everyone here is so good the Academy is going to find it difficult to divide the spoils.  Kidman deserves the Best Actress award.  She has less screen time than you may expect but from the harrowing opening her presence hangs over the film even when she isn't on screen.  Some have criticized this as a rather humorless portrait of Woolf, with Kidman's performance failing to capture the wit and the charm of the great writer.  But the screenplay doesn't give her much scope.  And why should it?  This isn't a Virginia Woolf bio-pic.  It's more a film about her work and its impact than it is about Woolf's own personality.

591116,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,B00005JKTI,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[3, 6]","Stephen Daldry's ""The Hours"" is one of the more courageous and thought-provoking cinematic works of recent years. You will literally be thinking about the many themes this film covers for days to come after seeing it. While events never truly repeat themselves from era to era, there are certain experiences that remain constant. Such experiences echo throughout time but take on a new shape with each succeeding generation.""The Hours"" features three story arcs: the first is set in the 1940's and features author Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), the second is set in the 1950's and features housewife Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), and the last is set in 2001 and features modern woman Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep). All three women project strong facades to the outer world although each of them is suffering inside. The pressures of conforming to the role of nurturer expected of them continuously clashes with the cultural and social liberation they so desperately crave. There is sadness, despair, and guilt in all of these women's lives and the cold indifference in which their male companions regard their suffering forces them to seek support physically and spiritually in other women.&quot;The Hours&quot; does not directly link the three separate arcs together in any conventional narrative. The three stories exist to illustrate how events throughout time rhyme with each other rather than truly repeat themselves. This film provides unique, but indirect, insights into the female experience through nuance and metaphor. It will therefore prove disorienting to those used to more straightforward styles of storytelling. However, those interested in sampling something different will be rewarded with an emotionally powerful viewing experience. The cast is astonishing with Kidman, Moore, and Streep all showing why they are considered three of the best actresses working today. The supporting cast of Stephen Dillane, John C. Reilly, Allison Janney, Claire Danes, Ed Harris have enough talent themselves to headline their own film but distinguish themselves well in strong supporting performances. Mention must also be made of Philip Glass' musical score which works to accentuate the strong emotional states of the film's various characters.

It is fair to say I am not imbued with delight at Virginia Woolf's style of writing.I am happy to have to discard my unkind premonitions and admit a delight and awe for ""The Hours."" It is a visual treat from the beautiful English countryside to the lush palms of 50's suburban L.A. to Clarissa's funky brownstone in 2001 New York City.  And the ladies! Nicole Kidman's slat thin, gawky strained and repressed Virginia Woolf, Julianne Moore's tragically unhappy but luminescent Laura Brown, and Meryl Streep's teetering on the edge of despair, Clarissa.  All three were magnificent, and it is difficult to choose among them.  Ms. Moore's tremendous restraint gave a powerful, suffocating tension to her role that overwhelmed me with its brilliance.  My companion thought Ms. Streep was radiant.  But I certainly wouldn't want to slight Ms. Kidman who said so little, but showed so much.  Her scene with her servant (who clearly intimidated her) insisting that she must purchase ginger for treats was masterful comedy.  She was trying to be firm while almost fainting with revulsion at the sight of the servant carving raw meat in her kitchen.The supporting cast were each a star in their own right, they were so perfect in their roles. I couldn't help but smile at the thought of how much Ed Harris must have enjoyed the all-out bombastic role of Richard, the poet dying of AIDS.  I hope the costumier, Ann Roth, is awarded her Oscar for the beautiful authenticity of the attire. She even remembered that silk hose, lovely as they are, DO tend to wrinkle.  The score, while charming, got a bit intrusive at times.  There was a moment or two when I felt a strong desire to say, ""Live for the moment!

591120,A3OMPSEVL59ZDK,B00005JKTI,"Sylo ""Sylo""","[4, 7]","This film is the first film in a long time where I actualy agree with the film that may or may not bring home the big Best Pic award at the Oscars. Normally that prize is given to the film that's the most showy and obvious. This film had the power to do something very few films can do today and that is, give the audiece some more credit and give them some more to think about afterwards. Everyone is wondering WHY they were so sad. In the great tradition of Mr. David Lynch I believe that we don't always need to be spoon fed the answers. Haven't you ever been sad and could not for the life of you figure out why? The human person is far more complex then to just sum things up in a neat package. It's far too easy to dimiss this film as a ""chick-flick"" and just say that women are too dramatic. Women are complex and beautiful creatures. They are far more keen to their emotions then men are, and that is what the film is about. I thought this was a striking film and simply one of the best of the year. But to me it does stand out just a little bit more because it had a wonderful conclusion and I couldn't stop talking about it afterwards.And about the whole repressed Lesbian thing. That is far too easy an answer. The only Lesbian in the movie was Meryl Streep, Virginia Wolf and Julianne Moore did it out of a repressed longing just to be free to do whatever they wanted. It was a sign of inner rebellion. To dumb the film down into ""a movie about three depressed lesbians"" is an insult to the film and the three great actresses who brought it to life. Each performance was just an eye opening experience, and the cross over from past to present was very reminiscent of another great film of 2002, Adaptation.In a time where movies are far too straight forward and peddle the audience with easy answers it's nice to see that film's still leave themselves open to interpretation. Lives are not so neat and easy to explain. When you can answer all the questions that come up in your life abouts sadness and joy then come back to this film and ridicule it, but if you cannot I suggest you watch it again and admire it for what it doesn't answer.To the many women who live long hard hours.",5,I must defend this film.,1043971200,"01 31, 2003",2003,2194,"['film', 'first', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'where', 'actualy', 'agree', 'film', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'bring', 'home', 'big', 'Best', 'Pic', 'award', 'Oscars', 'Normally', 'prize', 'given', 'film', 'most', 'showy', 'obvious', 'film', 'had', 'power', 'do', 'something', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'can', 'do', 'today', 'give', 'audiece', 'more', 'credit', 'give', 'more', 'think', 'afterwards', 'Everyone', 'wondering', 'WHY', 'were', 'so', 'sad', 'great', 'tradition', 'Mr.', 'David', 'Lynch', 'believe', 'do', ""n't"", 'always', 'need', 'be', 'spoon', 'fed', 'answers', 'Have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'been', 'sad', 'could', 'not', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'why', 'human', 'person', 'far', 'more', 'complex', 'then', 'just', 'sum', 'things', 'up', 'neat', 'package', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'dimiss', 'film', 'chick-flick', 'just', 'say', 'women', 'are', 'too', 'dramatic', 'Women', 'are', 'complex', 'beautiful', 'creatures', 'are', 'far', 'more', 'keen', 'emotions', 'then', 'men', 'are', 'what', 'film', 'thought', 'was', 'striking', 'film', 'simply', 'one', 'best', 'year', 'stand', 'out', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'had', 'wonderful', 'conclusion', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'talking', 'whole', 'repressed', 'Lesbian', 'thing', 'far', 'too', 'easy', 'answer', 'only', 'Lesbian', 'movie', 'was', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Virginia', 'Wolf', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'did', 'repressed', 'longing', 'just', 'be', 'free', 'do', 'wanted', 'was', 'sign', 'inner', 'rebellion', 'dumb', 'film', 'down', 'movie', 'three', 'depressed', 'lesbians', 'insult', 'film', 'three', 'great', 'actresses', 'who', 'brought', 'life', 'performance', 'was', 'just', 'eye', 'opening', 'experience', 'cross', 'past', 'present', 'was', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'great', 'film', '2002', 'Adaptation.In', 'time', 'where', 'movies', 'are', 'far', 'too', 'straight', 'forward', 'peddle', 'audience', 'easy', 'answers', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'still', 'leave', 'open', 'interpretation', 'Lives', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'neat', 'easy', 'explain', 'When', 'can', 'answer', 'questions', 'come', 'up', 'life', 'abouts', 'sadness', 'joy', 'then', 'come', 'back', 'film', 'ridicule', 'can', 'not', 'suggest', 'watch', 'again', 'admire', 'what', ""n't"", 'answer.To', 'many', 'women', 'who', 'live', 'long', 'hard', 'hours']",The Hours
591121,A1XOKNDK6BVAH2,B00005JKTI,"Tadaia ""Tadaia""","[4, 7]","If you sense an overly-critical tone in my review it's due to frustration. This had all the potential for ranking right up there with Dangerous Liaisons in my book. However, I couldn't help but notice the hint of irritating pretentiousness with the film in general... and what was the deal with Kidman's nose (extreme and annoying). Her performance was Oscar-worthy but the nose was an overdone and unnecessary distraction. Streep was good... though not outstanding (despite her lame melodramatic character who I could've cared less about). Until the kiss, I honestly spent part of the movie thinking Julianne Moore's character was umm... shall we say... ""mentally challenged""? Considering her character's issues I'm not quite sure if that qualifies as a good or bad performance. In the case of all 3 women, I failed to grasp the reason for all of the self-absorbed suicidal angst.In a situation like this, the real problem usually isn't with any of the aforementioned. Cinematic near perfection could've been achieved here. I've not read the source material but I felt like the screenplay may've missed some important theme(s) or failed in its attempt to sufficiently make the ""tie-in"" of the characters meaningful. There were tie-ins however. AND HOW! That ""Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself"" thing that spanned all three storylines had all the subtlety of a train wreck. Perhaps instead of throwing the audience that anvil they should've spent more time on character development... and I'd assume that this IS supposed to be a character-driven film. The leads didn't seem legit, especially Laura (how could she leave such a beautiful son that, clearly, loved her so dearly). Possible I'm sure but they didn't develop her enough to make it credible. As a woman who loves women, it should've been relatively easy relating to or caring about them.  The movie stayed in ""misery mode"" too much for my tastes without enough character development to really explain the misery. Instead I found myself either loathing them or occasionally thinking ""the acting's great but who cares?"".There was something else that I'm not quite sure of that disturbed me deeply about this film... IT'S INTENT.  Some of the messages and portrayals in the film were questionable at best and unacceptable at worst.  All 3 women were portrayed as oppressed and the oppression is ended only by some form of flight, abandonment (of devoted husbands and CHILDREN) or by relationships being severed through suicide.  Husbands are portrayed as pathetic one-dimensional ball-n-chains. (Male-bashing in a lesbian flick is a cheap shot) The only enduring relationship is Clarissa's lesbian relationship.  In the two scenes where the wives are busy ""feeling up"" neighbors and sisters, oddly enough a child is in the background silently watching the entire episode.  What's that all about?  In one of the final scenes with Clarissa the film actually attempts to validate Laura's self-serving abandonment of her own children.  ""That was death. I chose life"".  That was the moment when I wanted to nuke the film.Overall I gave it 3 stars. The photography, direction, art direction and acting definitely made the difference. The score's presence, or lack of, had its moments. I also thoroughly enjoyed Toni Collette (always hot), Stephen Dillane (the train depot scene was perhaps the film's best), Allison Janney (remarkably sexy) and Claire Danes (remarkably good)? All actors/actresses carried their roles extremely well. The exceptions were Ed Harris (his appearance was Oscar-worthy as an aids victim but his peformance was so pathetically over-the-top, I wanted to push him out of the window myself) and Laura's husband, who was so flaccid and one-dimensional that he was more like a caricature. I wasn't exactly sure if Laura was trying to kill herself because of the ""unhappy existence/sexuality thing"" or just to get away from him.Though I noted the limitations of the screenplay earlier I must admit that there were some truly exceptional moments which I enjoyed. This type of film can walk a fine line between brilliant and unbearable (in this case it's closer to brilliant).",3,Intelligent-Oscar-By-Default-Flick alert?,1047168000,"03 9, 2003",2003,4165,"['sense', 'overly-critical', 'tone', 'review', 'due', 'frustration', 'had', 'potential', 'ranking', 'right', 'there', 'Dangerous', 'Liaisons', 'book', 'However', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'notice', 'hint', 'irritating', 'pretentiousness', 'film', 'general', 'was', 'deal', 'Kidman', 'nose', 'extreme', 'annoying', 'performance', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'nose', 'was', 'overdone', 'unnecessary', 'distraction', 'Streep', 'was', 'good', 'not', 'outstanding', 'lame', 'melodramatic', 'character', 'who', 'could', ""'ve"", 'cared', 'less', 'kiss', 'honestly', 'spent', 'part', 'movie', 'thinking', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'character', 'was', 'umm', 'shall', 'say', 'mentally', 'challenged', 'Considering', 'character', 'issues', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'good', 'bad', 'performance', 'case', '3', 'women', 'failed', 'grasp', 'reason', 'self-absorbed', 'suicidal', 'situation', 'real', 'problem', 'usually', ""n't"", 'aforementioned', 'Cinematic', 'perfection', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'achieved', 'here', ""'ve"", 'not', 'read', 'source', 'material', 'felt', 'screenplay', 'may', ""'ve"", 'missed', 'important', 'theme', 's', 'failed', 'attempt', 'sufficiently', 'make', 'tie-in', 'characters', 'meaningful', 'were', 'tie-ins', 'however', 'HOW', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'said', 'would', 'buy', 'flowers', 'thing', 'spanned', 'three', 'storylines', 'had', 'subtlety', 'train', 'wreck', 'Perhaps', 'instead', 'throwing', 'audience', 'should', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'more', 'time', 'character', 'development', ""'d"", 'assume', 'supposed', 'be', 'character-driven', 'film', 'leads', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'legit', 'especially', 'Laura', 'how', 'could', 'leave', 'such', 'beautiful', 'son', 'clearly', 'loved', 'so', 'dearly', 'Possible', ""'m"", 'sure', 'did', ""n't"", 'develop', 'enough', 'make', 'credible', 'woman', 'who', 'women', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'relatively', 'easy', 'relating', 'caring', 'movie', 'stayed', 'misery', 'mode', 'too', 'much', 'tastes', 'enough', 'character', 'development', 'really', 'explain', 'misery', 'Instead', 'found', 'loathing', 'occasionally', 'thinking', 'acting', 'great', 'who', 'was', 'something', 'else', ""'m"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'disturbed', 'deeply', 'film', 'IT', 'INTENT', 'messages', 'portrayals', 'film', 'were', 'questionable', 'best', 'unacceptable', 'worst', '3', 'women', 'were', 'portrayed', 'oppressed', 'oppression', 'ended', 'only', 'form', 'flight', 'abandonment', 'devoted', 'husbands', 'CHILDREN', 'relationships', 'being', 'severed', 'suicide', 'Husbands', 'are', 'portrayed', 'pathetic', 'one-dimensional', 'ball-n-chains', 'Male-bashing', 'lesbian', 'flick', 'cheap', 'shot', 'only', 'enduring', 'relationship', 'Clarissa', 'lesbian', 'relationship', 'two', 'scenes', 'where', 'wives', 'are', 'busy', 'feeling', 'up', 'neighbors', 'sisters', 'oddly', 'child', 'background', 'silently', 'watching', 'entire', 'episode', 'What', 'one', 'final', 'scenes', 'Clarissa', 'film', 'actually', 'validate', 'Laura', 'self-serving', 'abandonment', 'own', 'children', 'was', 'death', 'chose', 'life', 'was', 'moment', 'when', 'wanted', 'nuke', 'film.Overall', 'gave', '3', 'stars', 'photography', 'direction', 'art', 'direction', 'acting', 'definitely', 'made', 'difference', 'score', 'presence', 'lack', 'had', 'moments', 'also', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'Toni', 'Collette', 'always', 'hot', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'train', 'depot', 'scene', 'was', 'perhaps', 'film', 'best', 'Allison', 'Janney', 'remarkably', 'sexy', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'remarkably', 'good', 'actors/actresses', 'carried', 'roles', 'extremely', 'well', 'exceptions', 'were', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'appearance', 'was', 'Oscar-worthy', 'aids', 'victim', 'peformance', 'was', 'so', 'pathetically', 'over-the-top', 'wanted', 'push', 'window', 'Laura', 'husband', 'who', 'was', 'so', 'flaccid', 'one-dimensional', 'was', 'more', 'caricature', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'sure', 'Laura', 'was', 'trying', 'kill', 'unhappy', 'existence/sexuality', 'thing', 'just', 'get', 'away', 'him.Though', 'noted', 'limitations', 'screenplay', 'earlier', 'must', 'admit', 'were', 'truly', 'exceptional', 'moments', 'enjoyed', 'type', 'film', 'can', 'walk', 'fine', 'line', 'brilliant', 'unbearable', 'case', 'closer', 'brilliant']",The Hours

Based on the award-winning Michael Cunningham novel of the same name, ""The Hours"" tells the story of three women whose lives are numbed to all feeling and are desperate to escape the private hell that enslaves each of them.  The story travels within four decades and jumps back and forth from the United States to England.  Nicole Kidman is author Virgina Woolf, who is battling depression while living in the suburbs of London with her overprotective husband in the 1920s.  Julianne Moore plays a 1950s Los Angeles housewife, apparently stifled by her marriage while coming to terms with her sexuality.  Merryl Streep is living in present-day Manhattan and is preparing a party for her longtime friend and AIDS-stricken poet (Ed Harris).  To explain how these three stories are connected would give away potential spoilers (if you haven't already read the book), but the film's performances are nothing short of excellent.  Kidman digs deep into the angst and despair of Woolf; her performance is a blazing revelation, and it excels by a nose (pardon the pun).  Moore's scenes with her young son are crushing and heartbreaking; you don't know whether to pity her or resent her for her selfishness.  And Streep, is, as ever, a powerhouse.  But the real star of the movie is director Daldry, who extracts great performances, and does a wonderful job at bringing the screenplay to life.  ""The Hours"" is hardly a feel-good movie, and the recurring themes of suicide and despair may put off some. But it's no doubt one of the best films of 2002.",5,Three Women.  Three Decades.

One minor complaint I have is, I sort of wish the whole movie would have been about Nicole Kidman's character. I was fascinated with that particular story the most. Nicole Kidman has sure proved herself to be a brilliant performer. My favourite scene was when Virginia Woolf lays her head down by the dying bird and just stares into it's eyes.

What we did learn was that there was a lot of homosexual overtones to each of the characters.

Nonetheless, as simple as it seems, it is one of the most emotionally intense movies you could expect from a spectacular leading cast of Meryl Streep, Julianne Moore and Nicole Kidman. Nicole Kidman as Virginia Woolf wrote the book Mrs Dalloway was read by Julianne Moore who substituted herself into the character of Mrs Dalloway and questioned about her own life. Meryl Streep, who was identified as Mrs Dalloway by her best friend felt herself suffering the way she didn?t mean to suffer. These 3 women, who were all on the crossroads of their lives, had to make a decision. However, no matter what decision they made, they had to live up with the outcome and the consequence. It is a question of life and happiness. Being identified as a happy person doesn?t necessarily mean that you are happy. Happiness is something you found within, but it is also a decision of whether you want to let it out or trap it inside. The process for searching for true happiness and relief is never easy, for you have to know what you want first, which is the catalyst to true happiness. Feeling being trapped in a life you think you don?t want to life requires enormous courage to break out from it. Nonetheless, this is another decision that one must live up to for the rest of his or her life. Death, regrets, relief may all be the outcome, but the problem is whether you are true to your own life. You may not agree with the ways these characters chose to break through their lives, but feeling the love, pain and happiness within them is the main focus of the movie. Without doubt, all Meryl, Julianne and Nicole put on a spectacular show in front of the audience. You may have personal favour for anyone of them, but they are all unquestionably great in the movie. Their acting is detailed and delicate. You can feel the life of these characters and feel the painful dilemmas that they went through. The movie would not be complete if it lacks anyone of them in it. Apart from the leading cast, the movie also has a very strong supporting cast ? Toni Collette, Claire Danes, John C. Reilly, Ed Harris etc., which added so much colour and life to the whole movie. Their performances are so natural and beautiful and finely tuned. One could not expect anymore refine acting than this one. The Hours may be emotionally intense and draining, but it would be a movie that touches the deepest part of your heart.

591128,AVGGEAI1YGSAP,B00005JKTI,Tucker Andersen,"[1, 1]","Virgina Woolf (Nicole Kidman), Laura Brown (Julianne Moore)  and Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) are three women apparently connected through the book MRS. DALLOWAY. Woolf as the author, Brown as the reader and Vaughn as the embodiment today. This is a complex and nuanced story that is translated to film in a very effective way. The scene shifts which gradually reveal the nature of the interrelationships among these women (both symbolic and real) are incredibly well directed, and the three stars are all superb. There are several additional excellent performaces, especially Ed Harris as the dying writer and friend of Vaughn for whom she is having a party (which mirrors the parties in the hours we experience in the lives of the other two women). In one of the strange turns of fate, Julianne Moore is cast as a troubled housewife in the seemingly idyllic fifties, thus in effect reprising her role in FAR FROM HEAVEN. And John C. Reilly does a great job as her seemingly clueless husband, recreating his role in CHICAGO without the musical routines.The overlapping stories of these three women are emotionmally powerful, but I suspect that as some reviewers have opined this is one of those instances where the movie does not and indeed cannot do total justice to the book given the inherent limitations in its format. While the cinematography is striking and the scene cuts among the three time periods well edited, there is an incredible amount of information for the viewer to absorb and little time to contemplate the events. (At times it would have been nice to be able to press pause or rewind, or to be able to reread a chapter or put down the book to think.)My sole caution is that this is a movie that is entertaining but not uplifting. Several reviewers have commented that it is about life, but the lives in this movie are not lives of joy. This is about people suffering from mental and physical disease (depression and Aids) who are living lives of quiet desperation and for whom the ultimate solution is sometimes suicide. These are people who even when outwardly appearing to cope with life with various degrees of success are frequently experiencing despair. My wife enjoyed the movie and was completely absorbed by the story and the powerful emotions that it elicted. While I agree that it was a well made film and an interesting story and was entertained by the excellent performances, I did not find it particularly compelling or enjoyable. However, I did feel that the surprise ending was excellent and was one of the factors that made me glad that I had seen the film.",4,"An Emotional Film About Disease, Despair and Death",1045353600,"02 16, 2003",2003,2596,"['Virgina', 'Woolf', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'Laura', 'Brown', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Clarissa', 'Vaughn', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'are', 'three', 'women', 'apparently', 'connected', 'book', 'MRS.', 'DALLOWAY', 'Woolf', 'author', 'Brown', 'reader', 'Vaughn', 'embodiment', 'today', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'story', 'translated', 'film', 'very', 'effective', 'way', 'scene', 'shifts', 'gradually', 'reveal', 'nature', 'interrelationships', 'women', 'symbolic', 'real', 'are', 'incredibly', 'well', 'directed', 'three', 'stars', 'are', 'superb', 'are', 'several', 'additional', 'excellent', 'performaces', 'especially', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'dying', 'writer', 'friend', 'Vaughn', 'whom', 'having', 'party', 'parties', 'hours', 'experience', 'lives', 'other', 'two', 'women', 'one', 'strange', 'turns', 'fate', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'cast', 'troubled', 'housewife', 'seemingly', 'idyllic', 'fifties', 'thus', 'effect', 'reprising', 'role', 'FAR', 'FROM', 'HEAVEN', 'John', 'C.', 'Reilly', 'great', 'job', 'seemingly', 'clueless', 'husband', 'recreating', 'role', 'CHICAGO', 'musical', 'routines.The', 'overlapping', 'stories', 'three', 'women', 'are', 'emotionmally', 'powerful', 'suspect', 'reviewers', 'have', 'opined', 'one', 'instances', 'where', 'movie', 'not', 'indeed', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'total', 'justice', 'book', 'given', 'inherent', 'limitations', 'format', 'cinematography', 'striking', 'scene', 'cuts', 'three', 'time', 'periods', 'well', 'edited', 'incredible', 'amount', 'information', 'viewer', 'absorb', 'little', 'time', 'contemplate', 'events', 'times', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'be', 'able', 'press', 'pause', 'rewind', 'be', 'able', 'reread', 'chapter', 'put', 'down', 'book', 'think', 'sole', 'caution', 'movie', 'entertaining', 'not', 'uplifting', 'Several', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'life', 'lives', 'movie', 'are', 'not', 'lives', 'joy', 'people', 'suffering', 'mental', 'physical', 'disease', 'depression', 'Aids', 'who', 'are', 'living', 'lives', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'whom', 'ultimate', 'solution', 'sometimes', 'suicide', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'even', 'when', 'outwardly', 'appearing', 'cope', 'life', 'various', 'degrees', 'success', 'are', 'frequently', 'experiencing', 'despair', 'wife', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'was', 'completely', 'absorbed', 'story', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'elicted', 'agree', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'film', 'interesting', 'story', 'was', 'entertained', 'excellent', 'performances', 'did', 'not', 'find', 'particularly', 'compelling', 'enjoyable', 'However', 'did', 'feel', 'surprise', 'ending', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'one', 'factors', 'made', 'glad', 'had', 'seen', 'film']",The Hours

I found it of note that they did not ever mention the well known fact that Woolf had been molested perhaps as early as six, having suffered at the hands of two step brothers.It has been noted men in her family were needy and predatory.  Woolf herself wrote of the impact of the abuse she had suffered, she read  her paper '22 Hyde Park Gate'  to the Memoir Club and described the assaults by her half brother George Duckworth, which lasted through her adolescence and young woman hood, which had "" spoilt her life for her before it had fairly begun"".There is much more detail on her often cruel and neglectful family etc. but the thing I have to wonder about is why there is never one mention of any of this in the movie.I still would recommend this movie to anyone, The acting is astoundingly good.......very profound and it touches on how everyday life can be so difficult for some people.....issues about how to deal with greif, forgivness, the ability to go on with life and experience the moments of good that are around you none the less.......and the healing effect of understanding .....The entire film is beautifully done, the actors give wonderful performances, I would say that this is the best work ever done by nicole kidman and julianne moore.drama, 20th century american fiction, virginia woolf, aids, meryl streep, julianne moore, los angeles, nicole kidman, california",4,Powerful,1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,1482,"['loved', 'film', 'so', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'portraying', 'realities', 'characters', 'lives', 'found', 'note', 'did', 'not', 'ever', 'mention', 'well', 'known', 'fact', 'Woolf', 'had', 'been', 'molested', 'perhaps', 'as', 'early', 'six', 'having', 'suffered', 'hands', 'two', 'step', 'brothers.It', 'been', 'noted', 'men', 'family', 'were', 'needy', 'predatory', 'Woolf', 'wrote', 'impact', 'abuse', 'had', 'suffered', 'read', 'paper', 'Hyde', 'Park', 'Gate', 'Memoir', 'Club', 'described', 'assaults', 'half', 'brother', 'George', 'Duckworth', 'lasted', 'adolescence', 'young', 'woman', 'hood', 'had', 'spoilt', 'life', 'had', 'fairly', 'begun', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'often', 'cruel', 'neglectful', 'family', 'etc', 'thing', 'have', 'wonder', 'about', 'why', 'never', 'one', 'mention', 'movie.I', 'still', 'would', 'recommend', 'movie', 'anyone', 'acting', 'astoundingly', 'good', '.very', 'profound', 'how', 'everyday', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'so', 'difficult', 'people', 'how', 'deal', 'greif', 'forgivness', 'ability', 'go', 'life', 'experience', 'moments', 'good', 'are', 'none', 'less', '.and', 'healing', 'effect', 'understanding', '..The', 'entire', 'film', 'beautifully', 'done', 'actors', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'would', 'say', 'best', 'work', 'ever', 'done', 'nicole', 'kidman', 'julianne', 'moore.drama', '20th', 'century', 'american', 'fiction', 'virginia', 'woolf', 'aids', 'meryl', 'streep', 'julianne', 'moore', 'los', 'angeles', 'nicole', 'kidman', 'california']",The Hours
591131,ASJ89T42CIUHU,B00005JKTI,V. Marshall,"[4, 8]","Recently I viewed the movie, &quot;The Hours&quot; starring Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Ed Harris and Julianne Moore. The movie is based on the book by Michael Cunningham and follows the book's ideas about as precisely as possible for a screenplay conversion.The story revolves around the author, Virginia Woolf, as she writes her story, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and how the words she writes affect two other women in different time periods. Virginia is portrayed by Nicole Kidman and she does a wonderful job showing the essence of Virginia's depression and self-doubt. A brilliant writer who involves all of your senses in her prose she succumbs to the artist's tendency to be self-doubters and insecure, possibly from all the exposure to critics at every bend and corner. The cigarettes she smokes seethe about her as she contemplates her suicide and a word to leave behind, like her soul is going up in smoke. She lies beside a dead bird and she feels dead before her time, unable to fly and stifled by depression that is never fully explained. Her end is filmed in such a way that she surrenders herself to the river's current and slowly gets swept away by nature but she seems somehow freed by her own death, floating along in time and crossing the borders that time presents.Julianne Moore plays the character, Laura Brown; a pregnant homemaker in the 1950's who is struggling with what life has to offer her. She seems to exist in a blur of emotion all of which sways towards depression. She attempts to bake a perfect cake for her &quot;perfect&quot; husband's birthday and fails sending herself into a moment of panic that almost produces her own demise. She runs away from her child and stays alone in a hotel ready to take her life and that of her unborn. She reads &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; and becomes involved in another's misfortune which somehow awakens her to her senses and she retreats back to the normalcy of her mundane life. I could not help but be emotional during a scene where she is preparing herself for bed and her husband calls from the bedroom, &quot;Come to bed Laura Brown,&quot; it left me with a sickened feeling. In Laura's eyes you see her sadness and her desperate need to leave but she stays, unhappily, like a servant.Meryl Streep plays, Clarissa Vaughn, a modern woman who follows the footsteps of Virginia's character &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; as she spends her day catering to others. She buys flowers in desperate attempts to cheer up those around her when in fact she is the one who is in need of cheer. She tries to revive a dying man played brilliantly by Ed Harris, Richard, who is succumbing to the power of AIDS and all of its downfalls. Clarissa opens windows for brightness where all she sees is gray; she perks up the grayness with flowers but only manages to bring a feeling of hopelessness to Richard instead. His writing award seems to go unnoticed although she plans a tremendous celebration his soul just shuts down. Under all of the pressure Clarissa breaks down and experiences the sadness of the day and the reality of death. Richard falls from his own window in his desperate act of suicide and mercy. Clarissa is left to deal with all of the pain.In the end we learn that Richard is in fact the son of Laura Brown. Seemingly she has transferred her loneliness and despair to the life of her own son without regret. She explains that she abandoned her family after all, needing to conduct her life on her own terms.The music and the language of the film inspire creative juices, especially the scenes where Virginia Woolf is speaking. Having read the book first I was able to experience more than the film managed to contain although the film was more easily explained. I recommend both expressions for the full impact of these desperate women and the lives they lead.

591132,A2KU5PG32H7QBN,B00005JKTI,"wannabemoviecritic ""wannabemoviecritic""","[5, 6]","This is by far the best movie I have ever seen.  Most people say that I am exagerating and that it isn't that good of a movie, but I beg to differ.  This film perfectly weaves the three time periods so exquisitly that the message and emotion the book and movie try to create are there at every moment.  I think that a lot critics either saw it as a chick flick or thought it was boring, but if you look at the certain detail of every scene and every actress, you will find a treasure.This movie can be a confusing setting, but the way director Stephen Daldry crafted the plots makes it a clear film.  It starts out with Virginia Woolfe's suicide.  Then it progresses to introduce the three women: Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) of 1951 who is living for her husband's sake and her son's sake and suffocating under the pressure to create a perfect household and a flawless image; second to appear again is Virginia Woolfe (Nicole Kidman), who is living according to what her docter's say and her husband wants; and finally, Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) is a 2001 New York woman living to care for her best friend, Richard (Ed Harris), who is dying of AIDS.  Throughout the film, certain characters approach each woman at different times and help reveal that they are all living (and dying, somewhat) for other people.  This movie is about how they discover happiness and what this emotion requires.I believe everyone should see this movie for the acting, alone.  Nicole Kidman proves herself to be a magnificent actress that is versatile and will continue to show her skill.  As Woolfe, she lets her inner-pain spill out and manifest itself in one of the most spectacular scenes of the movie.  Moore was the second best of three.  As Brown, a nearly silent role, she feels devastation that she was sucked into the life she has.  She really explains this through tears and facial expressions to the point where you have figured her out completely.  Streep plays Vaughn a.k.a. Mrs. Dalloway acording to Richard.  She literally is living for Richard.  Every day she goes to see him, and feed him, and care for him.  In the movie, she is buying flowers for him, bragging for him and planning a party for him.  Streep really grasps onto Clarrisa Vaughn's sense of unhappiness with life.  She has yet to learn what it is to live for herself.Throughout the rest of the film there are many smaller performances that caught my eye.  The first of which is Laura Brown's friend Kitty, played by Acadamy Award nominated Toni Collette.  She resembles Mrs. Dalloway in Laura Brown's explanation.  She is a confident woman that suffers but does not show it.  Collette has an ability to really portray these feelings so well.  Another great supporting performance was Ed Harris'.  He successfully plays a dying man, slightly insane but one who recognizes Clarissa's problem.  John C. Reilly, the boy playing Laura Brown's son and Claire Daines all had shining moments.Bottom Line: Everything about the making of this film and everything about the acting and the writing were all so hauntingly beautiful it stops you in your tracks and makes you realize that this is a classic of film making.

591133,A2Q457CES5ZUZ,B00005JKTI,William Hare,"[6, 10]","&quot;The Hours&quot; is one the greatest examples in film history of three actresses in the same film achieving Oscar level pinnacles.  While only one, Nicole Kidman, would secure a statuette for &quot;Best Actress,&quot; Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep performed at an equivalent level of brilliance.Based on a Pulitzer Prize winning novel by Michael Cunningham, the story revolves around the creative act of novelist Virginia Woolf, played by Kidman, writing her most memorable work, &quot;Mrs. Dalloway,&quot; along with the impact that work had on other people at later points in time.  The book is referred to as a point of reference by Julianne Moore in her suburban Los Angeles housewife's life of 1951 and by Meryl Streep in 2000 Greenwich Village New York, where she functions as a book editor and seeks to comfort former lover Ed Harris, a brilliant poet who is dying of aids.  While Streep seeks to enhance Harris' desire to live by telling him that, by taking his pills he can live a good while longer, he reflects on what he sees as the hopelessness of his condition.We ultimately learn that the little boy who fears that his mother, played by Moore, will leave him, is actually Haris in his youth.  Feeling the same doubts about life that Kidman experiences as Woolf while she writes what will become her most famous work, Moore goes to a hotel room with the idea of swallowing enough pills to commit suicide.  Moore decides not to go through with the suicide attempt, but later, after she has the child she is carrying, leaves her husband, her newly born daughter, and young son, who later, as a sensitive poet and novelist, carries the burden of that rejection with him.Top British dramatist David Hare adapted Cunningham's novel superbly, giving a brilliantly cerebral written work a visual feel, while Steven Daldry directed with a skilled but never interfering hand, letting the brilliant performers establish their own respective voices.  What makes this film so unique is the way that a creative artist's impact is shown through the lives of people at another point in time living in another country, who are sensitively attuned to the pain the author felt as she grappled with the question of life and whether or not to continue living it.",5,A Trio of Oscar Efforts,1058313600,"07 16, 2003",2003,2262,"['quot', 'Hours', 'quot', 'one', 'greatest', 'examples', 'film', 'history', 'three', 'actresses', 'same', 'film', 'achieving', 'Oscar', 'level', 'pinnacles', 'only', 'one', 'Nicole', 'Kidman', 'would', 'secure', 'statuette', 'quot', 'Best', 'Actress', 'quot', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'performed', 'equivalent', 'level', 'brilliance.Based', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'Michael', 'Cunningham', 'story', 'creative', 'act', 'novelist', 'Virginia', 'Woolf', 'played', 'Kidman', 'writing', 'most', 'memorable', 'work', 'quot', 'Mrs.', 'Dalloway', 'quot', 'impact', 'work', 'had', 'other', 'people', 'later', 'points', 'time', 'book', 'referred', 'point', 'reference', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'suburban', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'housewife', 'life', '1951', 'Meryl', 'Streep', '2000', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'book', 'editor', 'comfort', 'former', 'lover', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'brilliant', 'poet', 'who', 'dying', 'aids', 'Streep', 'seeks', 'enhance', 'Harris', 'desire', 'live', 'telling', 'taking', 'pills', 'can', 'live', 'good', 'while', 'longer', 'what', 'hopelessness', 'condition.We', 'ultimately', 'learn', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'mother', 'played', 'Moore', 'will', 'leave', 'actually', 'Haris', 'youth', 'Feeling', 'same', 'doubts', 'life', 'Kidman', 'Woolf', 'what', 'will', 'become', 'most', 'famous', 'work', 'Moore', 'hotel', 'room', 'idea', 'swallowing', 'enough', 'pills', 'commit', 'suicide', 'Moore', 'not', 'go', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'later', 'child', 'carrying', 'husband', 'newly', 'born', 'daughter', 'young', 'son', 'who', 'later', 'sensitive', 'poet', 'novelist', 'burden', 'rejection', 'him.Top', 'British', 'dramatist', 'David', 'Hare', 'adapted', 'Cunningham', 'novel', 'superbly', 'giving', 'brilliantly', 'cerebral', 'written', 'work', 'visual', 'feel', 'Steven', 'Daldry', 'directed', 'skilled', 'never', 'interfering', 'hand', 'letting', 'brilliant', 'performers', 'establish', 'own', 'respective', 'voices', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'unique', 'way', 'creative', 'artist', 'impact', 'shown', 'lives', 'people', 'point', 'time', 'living', 'country', 'who', 'are', 'sensitively', 'attuned', 'pain', 'author', 'felt', 'grappled', 'question', 'life', 'not', 'continue', 'living']",The Hours
591134,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JKTI,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[2, 3]","I must say that I loved this movie a great deal, and I saw it at the theater 2 times, but I saw Frida 5 times. I am very pleased with the cast, art direction, director, and oringinal score. What I was trully disappointed and even upset by was that Salma Hayek lost the Oscar to Nicole Kidman who had just one third of the movie here, and Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep not only had more screen time, but were more mesmerizing. Kidman was better in her other films including The Others, Moulin Rouge, and her breakthrough To Die For. This beautiful and artsy ""heavy-duty"" drama is not going to be appreciated by anyone who has sexual phobia or unsympathetic towards depressed and tramatized characters vividly portrayed here by Ed Harris, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, and Meryl Streep. If you embrace this film, you will be profoundly moved. Otherwise, you'll probably end up resenting it.Everyone in The Hours has something to do with the book Mrs. Dalloway written by Virginia Wolfe(Nicole Kidman) in the '30s of Richmond, England, and Julianne Moore  played a depressed housewife named Laura Brown living in Los Angeles in the '50s. Wolfe's book not only made an impact on Laura Brown, it also affected the lives of a the readers of modern day include Laura Brown's son Richard, a writer played by the scene-stealing Ed Harris, and his caretaker/ex-lover Clarissa Vaughan(Meryl Streep). Mrs. Dalloway is a character of good hostess, and she likes to throw parties for her friends, but ultimately neglects herself and becomes depressed. Clarissa gets nicknamed Mrs. Dalloway by Richard, because she loves to throw parties.The three time periods and stories are not directly connected, by it serves the same purpose for the film, and it's edited meticulously along with appropriate scores that makes the film consistent. The film takes place in just one day in three different eras. It the beginning, Wolfe narratted a suicide note as she walked into a river after completing the writing of Mrs. Dalloway. Then it goes backward to early on in the day before when she was still working on the book. The three eras are inserted between each other back and forth as the day in the lives of three women progresses.In the day of Virginia, she gets a visit from her sister(played by the mesmerizing Miranda Richardson), and her children. While she was lounging with them, her mind was in the world of Mrs. Dalloway, and her sister was overwhelmed that she's still so eccentric and unstable. Later, she attempted to ran away from her husband, because she didn't want to live in Richmond anymore, and wanted to move back to London. Her husband acused of her mental sickness.....In the day of Laura Brown, she's heavily pregnant, and she spends the day at home with her son Richard. She reads Mrs. Dalloway, and was moved by it a great deal. She bakes a cake for her husband's(John C. Reiley) birthday with the help of Richard. Her neighbor Kitty comes over to ask her to take care of her dog when she goes to the hospital. Toni Collette is just in this one scene(about 5 mins.), and she's quite striking, especially when she engages a ""lesbian kiss"" with Julianne Moore. This moment she realized that she's so unhappy being a housewife, and wanted to end it. Later, Brown impulsively abandons Richard and proceeded a suicide attempt like the end of the book in a hotel room.......In the day of Mrs. Dalloway/Clarissa Vaughan buys the flowers herself like Mrs. Dalloway in the book. She goes to visit Richard who's dying of AIDS, and has no desire to live any longer. The party is being put together for him to celebrate his award-winning novel based on his life, with a ""monster"" character based on his mother, but he's reluctant to go, because he didn't want anyone to see him so sick. One of Richard's ex-boyfriend(Jeff Daniel) also came to her apartment when she was preparing the food. She breaks down into massive tears when they talked about the old memories of their relationship with Richard.......Other supporting roles are well played by Allison Janney(Clarissa's lover), Stephen Dillane(Wolfe's unconditional-loving husband), and Claire Danes(Clarissa's daughter).I was very moved by Ed Harris role and performance. He really portrayed all the pain and sadness of someone who is dying and had been abandoned by his mother when he was a boy. The scene when he committed suicide in front of Clarissa was so powerful. Meryl Streep was mesmerizing! Julianne Moore's depressed and suicidal housewife who chose to abandon her family instead killing herself may be unlikeable, but she's more outstanding, especially her scene opposite Meryl Streep when her character aged to be an old woman. The remorse and sadness on her face was flawless. As for Nicole Kidman, the scene at the train station was her best in this movie. It was a very heavy agruement with her husband. She's very meticulous with the mannerism, even though she doesn't totally looked like Virginia Wolfe. She's captivately when her mind is doing multiple thinking. Overall, Julianne Moore's crying scenes are more compelling to watch, because she's more vulnerable of the three.",5,""" You Are Laura Brown.""",1111536000,"03 23, 2005",2005,5145,"['must', 'say',
