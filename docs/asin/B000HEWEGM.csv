Lloyd,"[4, 4]","This video's cardio section is great, all the other workouts and the hype about workouts for your body type are not really worth it, but the cardio section is an amazing addition to your workout. just note that there is a lot of bouncing and jumping around so if you have bad knees or feet it's probably not the workout for you. The instructor is great too, she doesnt go too fast and isnt so irritating you turn the video off in 5 minutes like ALL of the firm videos. If you are like me and aren't highly coordinated skip the firm-they go too fast with too complicated of moves, but this womens health video is easy to follow and will definately work off calories-- I only gave it 4 stars because the rest of the workouts on the tape arent worth it.",4,great!,1204070400,"02 27, 2008",2008,750,"['video', 'cardio', 'section', 'great', 'other', 'workouts', 'hype', 'workouts', 'body', 'type', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'worth', 'cardio', 'section', 'amazing', 'addition', 'workout', 'just', 'note', 'lot', 'bouncing', 'jumping', 'around', 'so', 'have', 'bad', 'knees', 'feet', 'probably', 'not', 'workout', 'instructor', 'great', 'too', 'doesnt', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'isnt', 'so', 'irritating', 'turn', 'video', '5', 'minutes', 'firm', 'videos', 'are', 'are', ""n't"", 'highly', 'coordinated', 'firm-they', 'go', 'too', 'fast', 'too', 'complicated', 'moves', 'health', 'video', 'easy', 'follow', 'will', 'definately', 'work', 'off', 'calories', 'only', 'gave', '4', 'stars', 'rest', 'workouts', 'tape', 'arent']",Women's Health: Train for Your Body Type

It's got a customizable playlist, so you can work the parts you want and in the time you have. The moves are simple, but innovative enough not to bore you to death, and there are harder and easier options. Jessica Smith is the perfect morning workout partner in that she's straight-forward (no corny jokes or over-the-top enthusiasm) and has a killer body to keep me inspired. I have even started to take this one with me when I travel. All you need are a set of 5-8lb weights, and some workouts don't even require that. Highly recommend this one.

Other reviewers have already done a great job detailing what you're in for with this workout, and I don't have anything to add.My issue with this DVD, why I did not give it four stars that it should have, is that if you aren't sure of which body type you are, vis-a-vis this DVD, the instructor invites you to go to Women's Health Magazine's website and take their quiz.  Since the production of this workout DVD, Women's Health Magazine has re-done their website, and there is no quiz anymore, or if it's there, it's impossible to find.  This is not to say your success with this workout DVD hinges on a quiz you can't find to take, but if Women's Health is going to put out workout DVDs and advertise things on their website that are to be used as tools with the DVDs, they should keep these things on their website for longer than a year or so, in case someone buys this DVD a few years later.Other than this issue, this is a very good workout, especially if you're just getting started!",3,"Good Workout, Missing Web Support",1237852800,"03 24, 2009",2009,1079,"['surprisingly', 'versatile', 'workout', 'DVD', 'can', 'be', 'customized', 'almost', 'endlessly', 'Other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'detailing', 'what', ""'re"", 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'add.My', 'issue', 'DVD', 'why', 'did', 'not', 'give', 'four', 'should', 'have', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'body', 'type', 'are', 'vis-a-vis', 'DVD', 'instructor', 'go', 'Women', 'Health', 'Magazine', 'website', 'take', 'quiz', 'production', 'workout', 'DVD', 'Women', 'Health', 'Magazine', 're-done', 'website', 'quiz', 'anymore', 'there', 'impossible', 'find', 'not', 'say', 'success', 'workout', 'DVD', 'quiz', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'take', 'Women', 'Health', 'going', 'put', 'out', 'workout', 'DVDs', 'advertise', 'things', 'website', 'are', 'be', 'used', 'tools', 'DVDs', 'should', 'keep', 'things', 'website', 'longer', 'year', 'so', 'case', 'someone', 'DVD', 'few', 'years', 'later.Other', 'issue', 'very', 'good', 'workout', 'especially', ""'re"", 'just', 'getting', 'started']",Women's Health: Train for Your Body Type

1014398,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000HEWEGM,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[97, 99]","The concept behind this unique DVD from Women's Health is to provide different workout options for different body types.  There is a weekly schedule of pre-assembled complete workouts for three different body types, Classic Curvy, Athletic Build, or Long and Lean.  Although the routines for each type utilize the same workout segments, they are combined differently according to type (e.g., the Curvy rotation includes three days of cardio, whereas the Athletic rotation contains more strength work).  The individual workout segments are as follows:Warm-Up, 4 minutesCardio, 22 minutesUpper Body, 12 minutesLower Body, 13 minutesAbs & Core, 9 minutesCool-Down, 6 minutesThere are also three ""Amp It Up"" segments that can be used as optional add-ons:Kick-It, 5 minutes (kickboxing drills)Super Slow, 5 minutes (slow weight lifting)Power Flow, 7 minutes (flowing yoga and core work)In addition to using the three pre-programmed workouts (which allow you simply to select the day and go), you can also create you own, fully customized routines by mixing and match any of the above individual segments.  The cardio in particular is very challenging:  although it is short, it is high-intensity, high-impact.  It is presented in four rounds, which each round consisting of three 30-second intense intervals and then a single 30-second recovery interval.  Brief jogs are used to facilitate the quick transitions between intervals, and each round is performed twice total.  Instructor Jessica Smith works out with two background exercisers who show easier and more difficult modifications for most of the moves.I would definitely recommend this video to anyone looking to purchase a single fitness DVD with a wide variety of options.  Although easier modifications are shown, most of the segments are quite challenging, and therefore I would not recommend this video for beginners.  On the other hand, there is no heavy weight lifting either (Jessica recommends 3-5 lbs., although I went heavier for most of the exercises), so more advanced exercisers may be a bit disappointed.  However, I think this video is perfect for those at an intermediate level like myself; you will work hard and just might enhance your body type in the process!",5,Unique DVD contains various workouts customizable to your body type,1176681600,"04 16, 2007",2007,2233,"['concept', 'unique', 'DVD', 'Women', 'Health', 'provide', 'different', 'workout', 'options', 'different', 'body', 'types', 'weekly', 'schedule', 'pre-assembled', 'complete', 'workouts', 'three', 'different', 'body', 'types', 'Classic', 'Curvy', 'Athletic', 'Build', 'Long', 'Lean', 'routines', 'type', 'utilize', 'same', 'workout', 'segments', 'are', 'combined', 'differently', 'according', 'type', 'e.g.', 'Curvy', 'rotation', 'three', 'days', 'cardio', 'Athletic', 'rotation', 'more', 'strength', 'work', 'individual', 'workout', 'segments', 'are', 'Warm-Up', '4', 'minutesCardio', '22', 'minutesUpper', 'Body', '12', 'minutesLower', 'Body', '13', 'minutesAbs', 'Core', '9', 'minutesCool-Down', '6', 'minutesThere', 'are', 'also', 'three', 'Up', 'segments', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'optional', 'add-ons', 'Kick-It', '5', 'minutes', 'kickboxing', 'drills', 'Super', 'Slow', '5', 'minutes', 'slow', 'weight', 'lifting', 'Power', 'Flow', '7', 'minutes', 'flowing', 'yoga', 'core', 'work', 'addition', 'using', 'three', 'pre-programmed', 'workouts', 'allow', 'simply', 'select', 'day', 'go', 'can', 'also', 'create', 'own', 'fully', 'customized', 'routines', 'mixing', 'match', 'above', 'individual', 'segments', 'cardio', 'particular', 'very', 'challenging', 'short', 'high-intensity', 'high-impact', 'presented', 'four', 'rounds', 'round', 'consisting', 'three', '30-second', 'intense', 'intervals', 'then', 'single', '30-second', 'recovery', 'interval', 'Brief', 'jogs', 'are', 'used', 'facilitate', 'quick', 'transitions', 'intervals', 'round', 'performed', 'twice', 'total', 'Instructor', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'out', 'two', 'background', 'exercisers', 'who', 'show', 'easier', 'more', 'difficult', 'modifications', 'most', 'moves.I', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'video', 'anyone', 'looking', 'purchase', 'single', 'fitness', 'DVD', 'wide', 'variety', 'options', 'easier', 'modifications', 'are', 'shown', 'most', 'segments', 'are', 'quite', 'challenging', 'therefore', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'video', 'beginners', 'other', 'hand', 'heavy', 'weight', 'lifting', 'Jessica', '3-5', 'lbs.', 'went', 'heavier', 'most', 'exercises', 'so', 'more', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'However', 'think', 'video', 'perfect', 'intermediate', 'level', 'will', 'work', 'hard', 'just', 'might', 'enhance', 'body', 'type', 'process']",Women's Health: Train for Your Body Type

There is also an amp up yoga which is nice for a short quick yoga workout.I like the fact that you can mix and match, there is a nice interactive menu for you to choose not only which portion you want to do but which order you would like to do them in.  There is a slight pause between each selection but it is only a few seconds.  I'm an intermediate exerciser, not young any more but in decent shape and found both the cardio and strength portions challenging but not un-doable.  The amp up selections are short little 7 to 10 min. mini-workouts that are a bit more intense than the regular workout.  All were challenging enough but the yoga portion is one that should be watched first since it is a fast flow and would be difficult to follow if you didn't know which pose she was going to go to next.All in all I found this a good workout and felt both the cardio and the strength the next day.",4,Not bad if you do the custom option,1394928000,"03 16, 2014",2014,1251,"['got', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Jessica', 'Smith', 'instructor', 'know', 'can', 'be', 'deceptively', 'difficult', 'ignored', 'pre-programmed', 'choice', 'built', 'own', 'work', 'out', 'warm', 'up', 'cardio', 'strength', 'amped', 'up', 'sections', 'cool', 'down', 'choose', 'did', 'wu', 'cardio', 'amp', 'up', 'kick', 'cd', 'one', 'day', 'wu', 'strength', 'amp', 'up', 'abs', 'cd', 'also', 'amp', 'up', 'yoga', 'nice', 'short', 'quick', 'yoga', 'workout.I', 'fact', 'can', 'mix', 'match', 'nice', 'interactive', 'menu', 'choose', 'not', 'only', 'portion', 'want', 'do', 'order', 'would', 'like', 'do', 'slight', 'pause', 'selection', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', ""'m"", 'intermediate', 'exerciser', 'not', 'young', 'more', 'decent', 'shape', 'found', 'cardio', 'strength', 'portions', 'challenging', 'not', 'un-doable', 'amp', 'up', 'selections', 'are', 'short', 'little', '7', '10', 'min', 'mini-workouts', 'are', 'bit', 'more', 'intense', 'regular', 'workout', 'were', 'challenging', 'enough', 'yoga', 'portion', 'one', 'should', 'be', 'watched', 'first', 'fast', 'flow', 'would', 'be', 'difficult', 'follow', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'pose', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'next.All', 'found', 'good', 'workout', 'felt', 'cardio', 'strength', 'next', 'day']",Women's Health: Train for Your Body Type

It has daily pre-programmed workouts for athletic, curvy and lean body types which makes it a no-brainer.  But, you can also create your own custom workout as this is one of those matrix-type DVDs.  I found the DVD to be well produced, the instructor was pleasant, chatty, but not annoying at all and did a great job cueing and making sure you don't hurt yourself.  I like it and recommend it to anyone looking to mix it up a bit and not have to put too much thought into, ""what do I do today?"".

1014413,A231KSL42Z60CQ,B000HEWEGM,Melissa McKenzie,"[2, 8]","I hurt my knee!  Never have I done a workout video in the past where right in the middle of a section I get a shooting pain through my left knee!  I've done plenty of videos and reviewed a handful on Amazon.  I have mentioned that in the past I had an ankle issue that I was working through and the beginning signs of carpal tunnel from years of working in physical therapy (the sad part is that I'm not that old - at all!), but other than minor things I've never experienced a shooting pain (or much of any pain) in my knee(s) while working out until the cardio section of this video!  There is a lot of jumping and twisting and some lunges, but normally that wouldn't bother me.  I wanted to do a total body workout so I did all the sections alternating between the amp it ups and the toning.  Unfortunately, I went from the warm up right into the cardio portion and that's where I hurt my knee.  I did all of the other sections except the lower body (didn't want to put the strain on my knee) and the slow amp it up section and the rest was alright.  I was pleased that there were no push ups because those always bother my wrists.  The ""yoga"" section was a little hard on them but manageable.  I'm just bummed about the knee thing.  I'll take a couple of days off and I should be alright, but I can't give this any more than two stars because of the injury.  I do like that you can customize your workout (even though that seems to come standard with many workouts now), but I found the instructor to be fairly boring.  I didn't think she was all that motivating and actually, she was pretty bland.  It gets 1 star for the customizing part and 1 star for not relying on push ups.

It's one of my more intense workout DVDs and I always feel so invigorated and limber upon completing it.  I really love it and I can't recommend it highly enough.  You will definitely get an excellent workout.  I like the fact that there are so many options to choose from.  You could just do a warm-up, the cardio and then cool down (which is about 30 minutes) or you could do the ""Amp it Up"" section (adds about 5 minutes) and really amp up your workout.  Either way, you will be breathing hard and sweating.  Just a warning:  there is definitely a lot of jumping so if you have weak knees, you might want to stick with the low-impact modifications (there are advanced modifications too if you feel like challenging yourself).  Jessica Smith cues wonderfully and you can tell she is well trained.  She is upbeat but not over the top.  She is encouraging but not patronizing.  She includes moves that I have not seen in any other workout DVD (at least not those in my collection) and because I love yoga, the Amp it Up PowerFlow section (a short but strong combination of power yoga and pilates moves) seals the deal for me.Overall, it's a creative and fun workout.

You're supposed to do the various different segments on different days to train for certain body types, but I usually do all the segments at once, because they are a fantastic total body workout when done together.  Every segment impressed me, and was obviously designed to be as effective as possible.  You will need some light weights (2-5 pounds) and a mat for this workout.The good:--The cardio segment (about 22 minutes) is FABULOUS!  It's done in 4 ""rounds"" (circuits, really), and you do each circuit twice.  The exercises in each round are varied in intensity.  Inbetween each exercise you are jogging, so you are constantly keeping your heart rate up.  This is one of the few cardio segments from a magazine workout that I have that truly gets my heart rate up to 70-80% of maximum and keeps it in that range the entire time.--The toning segments (upper body, lower body, and abs) are all great, too--very effective moves.--All the moves are very simple and require little coordination to follow them; however they are very effective!--High and low impact options/modifications are shown for each exercise.Needs improvement:--I wished the toning segments could have been a little longer (they run about 11-12 minutes each)--Jessica Smith is a good instructor, but is a little ""wooden.""The good outweighs the bad here; This is an excellently designed workout that a beginner (using modifications) or an advanced exerciser would enjoy.
