From the end of the very first season I'm always left wondering if it'll return for another season and am always greatly pleased when it does. I became a ""fan"" of this show on Facebook, and there was a 5 minute clip previewing the upcoming season. At one point in it the cast and the producers explain what the word flashpoint means (I had always wondered why the show was called ""Flashpoint"" and never understood why). So when they said that it has to do with the moment in which the decision is made about what to do in a situation, it made perfect sense. It's that sort of thing that I think makes this show so great. The decisions this team has to make at the time of the ""flashpoint"". Some people might get caught up in the fact that this show is or should be all about taking down the ""bad guys"" but if those people looked more closely they'd see this show really has to do with how these calls affect the team and their own lives. The Season 4 premiere episode ""Collateral Damage"" is a great example. You've got a guy who has been accused of killing his 6 month old daughter and on the other side you've got SRU Ed Lane trying to deal with his wife and her pregnancy. By the end of the episode when you find out what really happened to the 6 month old baby, you also start to see the *possibility* of what Ed might have to go through with having a new baby and the positives and negatives that come with having a baby.And, to the other customer who reviewed this show, as much you want to think everything is black and white when it comes to shows like this, nothing is EVER that simple.

Watching the more news-worthy episodes makes a person realize that even though one, or several, of the characters (due to personal feelings or beliefs) may not agree with the orders issued, those orders are followed to the letter.I highly recommend this show to anyone who is a huge fan of cop shows.
