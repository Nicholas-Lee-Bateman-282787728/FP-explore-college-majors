340120,AZSN1TO0JI87B,6302841917,A. Estes,"[0, 0]","Well, maybe this one isn't the absolute worst, but it's still pretty bad.Oh the horror! The streak of rotten ""Amityville Horror"" sequels continues in ""Amityville: A New Generation."" In the direct-to-video affair, an up-and-coming photographer (Ross Partridge, whose credentials include (1) episode of ""In Living Color"" as well as playing ""Businessman"" in the ""Prom Night"" remake) brings a haunted mirror back to his hip and happening pad. It's not long before the mirror starts distorting reality, shedding some light on the wannabe-artist's past as well as threatening his circle of friends which includes Shaft and asian-Shannon Doherty in its ranks. Yet another ""Amityville"" flick where the ""Horror"" happens outside of the iconic house from the Margot Kidder/James Brolin original, it's no surprise to find ""A New Generation"" deviating even further from the original formula than before.Not that twisting the formula is such a bad thing -- it sort of worked in ""Amityville 1992: It's About Time"" (sort of) -- but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. For those keeping score, ""Amityville: A New Generation"" is the seventh installment in the shockingly long-winded and consistently mediocre ""Amityville Horror"" franchise. It's to be expected that the film isn't exactly top-notch material, but even judging it as a b-movie doesn't do it justice. The plot, if you can call it that, is really just an excuse for the presence of some admittedly cool paintings and softcore nudity (its only redeeming features, really). The horror in this ""Amityville Horror"" is in its banality. There is simply no tension to be found, and the bloodshed is kept to a minimum. Add this to the fact that hardly anybody in the film (save for Roundtree and Terry O'Quinn, cashing a check in an otherwise thankless role) can act to save their lives, and you have one very tepid experience.Even those who lapped up the schlock served up in the silly movie-of-the-week ""Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes"" or even the aforementioned 1992 affair will be hard-pressed to find anything redeeming about ""A New Generation."" To be quite frank, it's a chore to sit through and even when the film tries to twist things in an effort to re-connect itself to its roots, it just doesn't work. Whatever thrills were to be had with this premise were squeezed out by the anemic sequels that came before. Even if you enjoy cinematic junk food like this, approach with caution. This is not only the ""Amityville"" franchise at its worst, but also bottom-of-the-barrel even as far as '90s horror and DTV fare go.",1,Mirror Mirror On The Wall: Who Is The Worst Amityville Of Them All?,1372636800,"07 1, 2013",2013,2572,"['Well', 'maybe', 'one', ""n't"", 'absolute', 'worst', 'still', 'pretty', 'bad.Oh', 'horror', 'streak', 'rotten', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'sequels', 'Amityville', 'New', 'Generation', 'direct-to-video', 'affair', 'up-and-coming', 'photographer', 'Ross', 'Partridge', 'credentials', 'include', '1', 'episode', 'Living', 'Color', 'as', 'well', 'playing', 'Businessman', 'Prom', 'Night', 'remake', 'haunted', 'mirror', 'back', 'hip', 'happening', 'pad', 'not', 'long', 'mirror', 'distorting', 'reality', 'shedding', 'light', 'wannabe-artist', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'threatening', 'circle', 'friends', 'Shaft', 'asian-Shannon', 'Doherty', 'ranks', 'Amityville', 'flick', 'where', 'Horror', 'iconic', 'house', 'Margot', 'Kidder/James', 'Brolin', 'original', 'surprise', 'find', 'New', 'Generation', 'deviating', 'even', 'further', 'original', 'formula', 'before.Not', 'twisting', 'formula', 'such', 'bad', 'thing', 'sort', 'worked', 'Amityville', '1992', 'Time', 'sort', 'execution', 'quite', 'bit', 'be', 'desired', 'keeping', 'score', 'Amityville', 'New', 'Generation', 'seventh', 'installment', 'shockingly', 'long-winded', 'consistently', 'mediocre', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'franchise', 'be', 'expected', 'film', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'top-notch', 'material', 'even', 'judging', 'b-movie', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'plot', 'can', 'call', 'really', 'just', 'excuse', 'presence', 'admittedly', 'cool', 'paintings', 'softcore', 'nudity', 'only', 'redeeming', 'features', 'really', 'horror', 'Amityville', 'Horror', 'banality', 'simply', 'tension', 'be', 'found', 'bloodshed', 'kept', 'minimum', 'Add', 'fact', 'hardly', 'anybody', 'film', 'save', 'Roundtree', 'Terry', ""O'Quinn"", 'cashing', 'check', 'otherwise', 'thankless', 'role', 'can', 'act', 'save', 'lives', 'have', 'one', 'very', 'tepid', 'experience.Even', 'who', 'lapped', 'up', 'schlock', 'served', 'up', 'silly', 'movie-of-the-week', 'Amityville', '4', 'Evil', 'Escapes', 'even', 'aforementioned', '1992', 'affair', 'will', 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'A', 'New', 'Generation', 'be', 'quite', 'frank', 'chore', 'sit', 'even', 'when', 'film', 'tries', 'twist', 'things', 'effort', 're-connect', 'roots', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'thrills', 'were', 'be', 'had', 'premise', 'were', 'squeezed', 'out', 'anemic', 'sequels', 'came', 'Even', 'enjoy', 'cinematic', 'junk', 'food', 'approach', 'caution', 'not', 'only', 'Amityville', 'franchise', 'worst', 'also', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'even', 'as', 'far', ""'90s"", 'horror', 'DTV', 'fare', 'go']",N/A

Now, this sequel could have been a lot better, and it could have been somewhat scary, but because it lacks hauntings and fright, the film earned a three-star rating from me, meaning I thought that the film was...okay.KEYES TERRY (played by Ross Partridge), and his girlfriend LLANIE (played by Lala Sloatman) are both struggling artists. Their friends, DICK CUTLER (played by David Naughton, famous for his Dr. Pepper commercials and his role in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON), SUKI (played by Julia Nickson-Soul), JANET CUTLER (played by Barbara Howard), & PAULIE (played by Richard Roundtree), are all artists, as well, with Dick and Janet also being Suki, Keyes, & Llanie's landlords. While at a cafe, Keyes receives a strange mirror from a street-bum. The house is from...112 Ocean Ave. (how did you guess?) That night, while the kids are out, Suki's ex-boyfriend, RAY (played by Robert Rusler, only famous for his supporting role in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE) drops by. He finds the mirror in Suki's appartment, after Llanie and Keyes allow her to borrow it for awhile. The mirror casts off Ray's reflection very differently and then kills him. Suki is the mirror's next victim.Suddenly, the bum that gave Keyes the mirror is found dead. For some reason, Keyes tells DT. CLARK (played by Terry O'Quinn) to give the bum a proper burial. Keyes decides to find out some information on this guy, after finding out that the man's last name is the same as...Keyes' last name. Seven years ago, the bum was in a mental institution...for murderering his entire family in Amityville, New York...112 Ocean Ave (only changed to this character to keep Ronald DeFeo, Jr. from getting any money for this sequel if his name was used). Keyes is then shown to the bum's room, where he has a whole hallucination with Keyes being the role of the bum and seeing Keyes' mother and himself as a child visiting his derranged father. He snaps out of the hallucination, and tells Llanie about it. She informs him that in order to beat this, he has to face his fears.That night, the have an art gallery show, where he can stage the entire act of his father killing his family, while they sat, eating dinner (changed from when they were originally murdered as they slept). The art gallery show is going well, but the lights go out. Dick runs to the basement to turn them back on, but Suki appears, and kills Dick, but the lights are brought back on successfully. The show is now set for its final act, but instead of using a water gun as planned, Keyes uses a real gun, he shoots at the food on the table, and the shoots the mirror, which has been causing this whole ordeal. The nightmare is now over...for now.An okay sequel, but they should have had more of a story with the mirror, as far as having it cause more hauntings and gathering more victims.
