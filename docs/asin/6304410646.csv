419691,A244UKKZEQURA7,6304410646,"A. Alexander ""once met........................""","[1, 1]","A transient, feckless and reckless 'prey', stumbles into another 'world.' One one side, a world of decency, endeavour, honesty, trust, and, loyalty. On the other, one of unbridled desire; caused by chemistry, aura, dynamics, and, sensuality, placing, both the 'hunted' and the 'hunter' upon a collision course with destiny. Amongst them all, the 'hunter's' evil offspring, an Iago-figure, resentful of, the 'object of his desire' longing for someone representing all that was pure and decent (the 'hunted') rather than, the 'unacceptable' (Oedipus Rex is seen rearing his ugly head, throughout the film) the untenable, the vile. Sad tale, with an even sadder conclusion. The 'hunter' and the 'hunted' were (to quote from William Shakespeare) none other than, ""star crossed lovers, who had loved, perhaps not wisely, but, well."" The sexually-pulsating performance of a Cuban-born, Swiss Finishing School educated Venezuelan (Ms Maria Conchita Alonso) and a Dubliner with a Dutch name (Mr Arie Verveen) is absolutely electrifying. As for the East Los Angeles-born Edward James Olmos, I first had the privilege of seeing him star in ""The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez."" One highly-polished Performer, possessing the acting ablity of a Richard Burton, and, John Barrymore.

But like another reviewer said, the wife's son is so wicked that you can't help but blame him for the family's demise.  The wife and lover happen into this affair naturally-- how could they resist?This chilling family picnic is the most memorable scene.This is a great indie film that reminds you not to act on every desire because there are prices to pay.One of the few 5 star films.  If you see it, you'll agree how good it it.  It is dumbfounding how a movie like this is so unheard of.

The sex is so wild it is a wonder Olmoes did not hear them--in the shower, closet, bathroom.But--to me, the most brilliant role is played by Alonso's son--Steven Schub.  There is something so absolutely wicked about him, so evil, the viewer will blame him for the trangressions of the family, instead of the mother.During a picnic, he sticks his feet in his mother's lap pretending to be her lover--she does not know this until her lover stands to stretch--The look on Alonso's face is unbelievably cold as she rips his feet off of her skirt...One can only walk with the devil so long--but soon his long nails scratch, destroy, and kill.
