1655748,A1PB7VN1RNKZZY,B00DIR2PIW,A. Ellis,"[29, 32]","An interesting drama that makes you contemplate years of solitude in empty places.  I know this movie had some great reviews, but I will disagree on a few things.  None of the characters had any personality and you never really had a chance to know them and what makes them tick.  The main character was very unlikable and frankly boring.I had trouble getting my mind wrapped around that the ship was so tiny for a more than decade long trip.  The module the astronaut was stranded in seemed like it had no purpose.  It was a place to eat goo for food, no space to work, seemingly no storage for anything other than a toilet, spacesuit, and toolkit.  Okay, I know there were other modules, but no matter the challenge, I found it unlikely the rest of the ship would not have been put to use as part of a lifeboat home.  The ""Europa Report"" was a better example of what I expected of the astronauts to be like and a better example of a ship for a long trip.What I did like about the movie is the viewer had to contemplate being so alone for so long and in fear.  As for the last scene, which I won't give away.  All I can say is no way.  Honestly, this movie was worth watching once.  I will give it three stars because at least there was some thought provoking parts.

His acting, for what he had to work with, was passable.  If you enjoy watching a man in a box talking to himself, but in a 90 minute movie having effectively 1 thing of consequence happen (and it happens with the first several minutes)--that's right: ~80 minutes of waiting for something else to happen, and it never does, then enjoy.  If you prefer your movies have more than 1 thing of consequence happen (and you weren't even emotionally invested yet, so the thing that happened wasn't consequential in anything other than waking up the guy in the box, and killing a character about which you knew next to nothing), skip this.  As someone else commented, it's quite possible the 5 star reviews were written by the producers, director, the family, because I'm a hard-core Sci-Fi fan, and this movie is more like a student film, and a bad one, in which the student gets an F.

1655763,A2EF9GU4LAZI7W,B00DIR2PIW,Ernest Eliezer,"[1, 2]","There are a lot of negative reviews; most hinge either on not-great scientific accuracy--a sentiment with which I can sympathize, but which is sort of laughable as a critique of even a &#34;hard&#34; scifi movie--or on &#34;nothing happening.&#34;The problem is that most people in the US audience just aren't up for an atmospheric movie in the vein of the original Solyaris or most Japanese cinema other than chambara (i.e. basically the Japanese analogue to the sort of generic action flick Last Action Hero mocks), and those who are generally need to be in the right frame of mind.  If you're hoping for laser beams and aliens, or at least some good fancy 3D effects of explosions and dramatic what-have-you--if you think those are the things that make scifi work--you're not going to be satisfied.  I'm reminded of oddball, atmospheric, and slow-paced but enjoyable scifi like Moon and Silent Running.The pace is extremely slow, because it's a story about someone stuck alone in a box millions of miles from home for several months; it's also about exploration, and transformational experiences.  It does a lot of things, but it doesn't do them with explosions, and while I wouldn't necessarily call it very subtle, it doesn't explicitly tell you what the point of a scene or a network of related scenes is meant to be.  It takes some patience and thoughtfulness to appreciate, and we're mostly trained not to bring those qualities to cinema.Personally, I enjoyed it, simply by viewing it as an atmospheric, existential story.  Despite what some reviewers suggest, it doesn't try to do anything clever or add &#34;twists.&#34;  The story is always quite clear about where it's going.

I'm a huge fan of space adventure and I like all flavors--from Forbidden Planet to Star Wars to 2001 to Apollo 13 (which qualifies as space adventure, if not science fiction). However, there's been a ""realism"" hole in my sci-fi diet for far too long and I'm a little sick of war and horror films, etc, that brand themselves as science fiction simply because they have stars as their backdrop. You can't just tell a story like Hamlet and say at the end: ""o right, and this whole thing took place aboard a really cool spaceship and Horatio was green""  and, TA DA, science fiction.

Piston,"[0, 0]","The Last Push is a very powerful and highly realistic portrayal of the problems faced by an astronaut alone in space after an accident kills his companion and nearly disables his ship. It very realistically portrays the psychological problems faced by a person in prolonged isolation which have been long reported by many sources. It is both a fine psychological drama and a conventional one as well as we share with the astronaut his worry as to whether he can get his engine started in time to pull him out of Venus orbit and back to Earth. This is why, incidentally, it is unfortunate that the trailer killed much of that drama by telling us in advance that the engine was eventually started. As well written and portrayed as this film  was, it is very disappointing that a crucial aspect of the plot, the canceling of the mission to Europa, is never plausibly explained. Instead we are merely told that &#8220;things have changed&#8221; and later that the dead astronaut needs to be buried and that the owner of the company which sent the astronauts into  space cannot take another death on his conscience. None of these are satisfactory explanations and therefore the canceling of the mission, which is central to the plot, seemed inexplicable and quite frankly stupid when one considers that virtually all of the resources needed for the mission had already been expended at that point.

The dialog has been accused of being speech, but you must understand that this is an effect of the fact that these astronauts live in a fishbowl and the fact that messages are being sent with a time delay--so there's time to compose something.  This same theme of caution is reflected several times in talking about how cautious NASA is compared to the businessman funding this mission, and in how careful mission control is when talking to this astronaut due to his understandable sometime prickliness (haven't you ever said &#34;bear with me, I'm doing something hard&#34;?) and possible mental breakdown.  And finally, it all builds up to reinforcing the inspiring theme at the end.  I liked the hell out of it even though it was composed neither like written fiction or in the standard movie format.

Also, as a life long astronomy enthusiast, I found it difficult to accept some technical aspects of the premise. I don't want to be a spoiler, so I won't delve into them.
