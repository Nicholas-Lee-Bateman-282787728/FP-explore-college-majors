These DVD's, released by TGG Direct, under the supervision of MGM, do the show up right. The picture is crisp....every bit as good as major studio releases. I cannot attest to whether these are transferred progressively or interlaced, but they look good on my small widescreen screen.My only issue with TGG is the ridiculous packaging. They put the discs in two separate cases, one designed to hold two discs, and one with a single center hub, on which the remaining three discs are stacked. (This is never a good idea, because of the propensity for the discs to get scratched.) They then put the two cases inside an oversized (it stands well above other DVD sets on the shelf) box. And this is not your usual DVD box in form, either. It is a two piece box, with a bottom and a lid. Why couldn't they have issued one single plastic case for the entire set. Paramount and Shout! Factory have been issuing their season sets as such for quite some time.

In 1998, I bought a set of videos for a family member, and we had to be satisfied just to have the shows- the picture quality was pretty poor, but that was all we could get then, collector copies.Then in 2006, I saw HP on DVD, and sunk more money into that set. I was furious that they were just copies of what I already had-I know because I recognized the station ID's and glitches. A couple of the discs were defective, too.Last year, &#34;THIS&#34; network started airing Highway Patrol at 5 am, and I managed to tape some episodes, but it was inconvenient to set timer, and I wanted DVDs.  It was exciting to be able to SEE everything!I saw recently that Highway Patrol was available to manufacture on demand, but it was a bit pricey. Now this set is out, and the price was great! I don't know if the first season is available this way, it doesn't seem to be. I may even pay full price for them, because the quality is outstanding! You can see every detail, it's like watching them for the first time.Mind you, I never saw these until I was a grown-up. But I love the show!! If you like old black and white television from the 1950's, this is for you! Broderick Crawford is great, and the plots are pretty interesting.

Watch the ep &#34;Killer on the Run&#34;.During the last five minutes there are two women who are stopped by a guy with a gun.As he gets out of the car and approaches their car watch the hillside in the background.From right to left over it comes a roundish,smooth and quiet object.It is close enough that you see that there are no appendages so it isn't a plane and if it was,it would make a noise.It is quiet.It is moving at about the speed of a plane so it is too fast to be a blimp.It is shaped like two inverted pie plates together.I have watched that segment,which last about 6 -8 seconds, over and over,on normal view and close up.It is astonishing to watch.As the man/actor reaches the car the scene cuts to a different angle and the object is gone.It seems almost impossible that someone didn't see it.I would like to think the cameraman did and kept rolling and that footage is still with someone or the Air Force has it.Who knows? Watch it and be amazed for yourself.With all the cameras out and about in Hollywood,then and now,it isn't the first time UFOs have been caught be startled crews.UFOs aside,this season like the rest looks like it was filmed yesterday.I must say though that the first season done by MGM seems just slightly clearer than the rest by TGG, as their eps were limited to four a disc,whereas these are double that.More compression,more grain.However that's just a minor point.I found also this season, Broderick Crawford appeared a bit more relaxed in his delivery and demeanour.I suppose he knew the end was coming and was glad to be on the loose again.Be that as it may,Season Four was as good as any.These shows stand up beautifully still,and they are a joy to watch.Thanks to MGM,TGG and United Artists, from whence these films originally came,for preserving them and making them available for us once more.Highway Patrol brought back alot of memories of that era for me,a bit simpler in some ways to be sure,but with TV that was worth watching, FAR more than than the pap served up today.This was a family show,how many of those are there today? In this age they would have Crawford's character swearing,there would be blood  everywhere when Crawford fired his snub nosed .38,he'd be accused of being chauvinistic,and so much more.It's a different world and much to my chagrin they don't make them like Sea Hunt and Highway Patrol anymore.We may have lost something, but this shows we at least haven't lost it for good.",5,"HP goes out with a bang...and a UFO...no,really!",1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,3606,"['Highway', 'Patrol', 'Season', 'Four', '58/59', 'season', 'out', 'bang.After', 'four', 'years', 'Art', 'Gilmore', 'narration', 'finally', 'retired.This', 'season', 'seen', 'nifty', 'actors', 'come', 'go', 'are', 'Ken', 'Drake', 'frequently', 'seen', 'ZIV', 'TV', 'other', 'big', 'hit', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'William', 'Boyett', 'who', 'was', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'sidekick', 'most', 'eps', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Ted', 'Knight', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Gene', 'Roth', 'known', 'heavy', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'shorts', 'Columbia', 'Billy', 'Halop', 'Bowery', 'Boys', 'third', 'actor', 'group', 'make', 'HP', 'Mexican-American', 'actor', 'Rodolfo', 'Hoyos', 'Charles', 'Maxwell', 'well', 'known', 'TV', 'circuit', 'appearing', 'Bonanza', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'so', 'many', 'more', 'Robert', 'Conrad', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'well', 'known', 'character', 'actor', 'TV', 'hits', 'Laramie', 'Emergency', 'Wagon', 'Train', 'Dyan', 'Cannon', 'actress', 'TV', 'films', 'spelled', 'Diane', 'here', 'most', 'sources', 'see', 'have', 'making', 'first', 'TV', 'appearance', 'elsewhere', 'THIS', 'show', 'really', 'first', 'debuted', 'others.And', 'speaking', 'UFOs', 'did', 'know', 'ep', 'here', 'honest', 'goodness', 'UFO', 'appearing', 'quite', 'plainly', 'might', 'add', 'Watch', 'ep', '34', 'Killer', 'Run', '34', '.During', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'are', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'stopped', 'guy', 'gun.As', 'car', 'approaches', 'car', 'watch', 'hillside', 'background.From', 'right', 'left', 'roundish', 'smooth', 'quiet', 'object.It', 'close', 'enough', 'see', 'are', 'appendages', ""n't"", 'plane', 'was', 'would', 'make', 'noise.It', 'quiet.It', 'moving', 'speed', 'plane', 'too', 'fast', 'be', 'blimp.It', 'shaped', 'two', 'inverted', 'pie', 'plates', 'together.I', 'have', 'watched', 'segment', 'last', '6', '-8', 'seconds', 'over', 'normal', 'view', 'close', 'up.It', 'astonishing', 'watch.As', 'man/actor', 'car', 'scene', 'cuts', 'different', 'angle', 'object', 'gone.It', 'almost', 'impossible', 'someone', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'it.I', 'would', 'like', 'think', 'cameraman', 'did', 'kept', 'rolling', 'footage', 'still', 'someone', 'Air', 'Force', 'it.Who', 'knows', 'Watch', 'be', 'amazed', 'yourself.With', 'cameras', 'out', 'Hollywood', 'then', 'now', ""n't"", 'first', 'time', 'UFOs', 'have', 'been', 'caught', 'be', 'startled', 'crews.UFOs', 'aside', 'season', 'rest', 'was', 'filmed', 'yesterday.I', 'must', 'say', 'first', 'season', 'done', 'MGM', 'just', 'slightly', 'clearer', 'rest', 'TGG', 'eps', 'were', 'limited', 'four', 'disc', 'are', 'double', 'compression', 'more', 'grain.However', 'just', 'minor', 'point.I', 'found', 'also', 'season', 'Broderick', 'Crawford', 'appeared', 'bit', 'more', 'relaxed', 'delivery', 'demeanour.I', 'suppose', 'knew', 'end', 'was', 'coming', 'was', 'glad', 'be', 'loose', 'again.Be', 'may', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'any.These', 'shows', 'stand', 'up', 'beautifully', 'still', 'are', 'joy', 'watch.Thanks', 'MGM', 'TGG', 'United', 'Artists', 'whence', 'films', 'originally', 'came', 'preserving', 'making', 'available', 'once', 'more.Highway', 'Patrol', 'brought', 'back', 'alot', 'memories', 'era', 'bit', 'simpler', 'ways', 'be', 'sure', 'TV', 'was', 'worth', 'watching', 'FAR', 'more', 'pap', 'served', 'up', 'today.This', 'was', 'family', 'show', 'how', 'many', 'are', 'there', 'today', 'age', 'would', 'have', 'Crawford', 'character', 'swearing', 'would', 'be', 'blood', 'everywhere', 'when', 'Crawford', 'fired', 'snub', 'nosed', '.38', ""'d"", 'be', 'accused', 'being', 'chauvinistic', 'so', 'much', 'more.It', 'different', 'world', 'much', 'chagrin', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'Sea', 'Hunt', 'Highway', 'Patrol', 'anymore.We', 'may', 'have', 'lost', 'something', 'least', 'have', ""n't"", 'lost', 'good']",Highway Patrol Complete Season 4
