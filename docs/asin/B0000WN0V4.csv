It had some comical parts, but I will have to watch futher to get the full affect of the show.  This show does not look well on my hd tv.  It shows in analog format to me.  It was a little blurry and dark.  I suppose after watching it futher, I may see some difference in the quality of this show on dvd.  I am glad I only paid $5.00 for this show.From the positive reviews by most, I am not seeing how this could be appropriate for all ages concerning children.",3,Wouldn't Let Young Toddlers Watch,1342742400,"07 20, 2012",2012,576,"['bought', 'young', 'grandchildren', 'watching', 'couple', 'episodes', 'feel', 'would', 'frighten', 'had', 'comical', 'parts', 'will', 'have', 'watch', 'futher', 'get', 'full', 'affect', 'show', 'show', 'not', 'look', 'well', 'hd', 'tv', 'analog', 'format', 'was', 'little', 'blurry', 'dark', 'suppose', 'watching', 'futher', 'may', 'see', 'difference', 'quality', 'show', 'dvd', 'am', 'glad', 'only', 'paid', '5.00', 'positive', 'reviews', 'most', 'am', 'not', 'seeing', 'how', 'could', 'be', 'appropriate', 'ages', 'concerning', 'children']",Sitting Ducks: Season 1 Quack Pack

Ducktown and Swampwood were the places to be. Bill, a duck and a gator named Aldo become unlikely friends after an attempt by Aldo to eat Bill results in a toothache and a realization that Bill is more than just a lunch when Bill risks himself to help the gator in need. After that, it is hijinks all the way as both slowly adjust to one another over time, dealing with everything from crazy friends to dealing with other gators who still raid Ducktown in search of someone to eat. I got this compilation and while I love it, it only leaves me wanting more.",5,An imaginative premise.....,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,646,"['dearly', 'loved', 'series', 'when', 'was', 'Cartoon', 'network', 'then', 'Hub', 'late', 'night', 'Ducktown', 'Swampwood', 'were', 'places', 'be', 'Bill', 'duck', 'gator', 'named', 'Aldo', 'become', 'unlikely', 'friends', 'attempt', 'Aldo', 'eat', 'Bill', 'results', 'toothache', 'realization', 'Bill', 'more', 'just', 'lunch', 'when', 'Bill', 'help', 'gator', 'need', 'hijinks', 'way', 'slowly', 'adjust', 'one', 'time', 'dealing', 'everything', 'crazy', 'friends', 'dealing', 'other', 'gators', 'who', 'still', 'raid', 'Ducktown', 'search', 'someone', 'eat', 'got', 'compilation', 'love', 'only', 'wanting', 'more']",Sitting Ducks: Season 1 Quack Pack
787890,A3T6HX48F66512,B0000WN0V4,Fry Boy,"[0, 0]","""Sitting Ducks"" is an enjoyable little show.  My children are 4.5 and six years of age right now and find ""Sitting Ducks"" to be quite amusing.  The plots are simple, funny, and easy to understand.  Another plus is that the show doesn't contain all that adult humor--which typically isn't even funny--so prevalent in today's cartoons and doesn't have every character saying ""dumb"" or ""stupid.""  (Granted, in the very first episode, one of the ducks refers to a TV show as ""dumb,"" but that's the only instance I heard in any of the season 1 episodes.)  If your kids are tired of ""Backyardigans,"" then they might like this for a change.Also recommended are the ""Peep and the Big Wide World"" shows, which also represent wholesome family entertainment.",5,"Great show for everyone, young children to adults",1252368000,"09 8, 2009",2009,747,"['Sitting', 'Ducks', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'show', 'children', 'are', '4.5', 'six', 'years', 'age', 'right', 'now', 'find', 'Sitting', 'Ducks', 'be', 'quite', 'amusing', 'plots', 'are', 'simple', 'funny', 'easy', 'understand', 'show', ""n't"", 'contain', 'adult', 'humor', 'typically', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'so', 'prevalent', 'today', 'cartoons', ""n't"", 'have', 'character', 'saying', 'dumb', 'stupid', 'Granted', 'very', 'first', 'episode', 'one', 'ducks', 'refers', 'TV', 'show', 'dumb', 'only', 'instance', 'heard', 'season', '1', 'episodes', 'kids', 'are', 'tired', 'Backyardigans', 'then', 'might', 'like', 'change.Also', 'recommended', 'are', 'Peep', 'Big', 'Wide', 'World', 'shows', 'also', 'represent', 'wholesome', 'family', 'entertainment']",Sitting Ducks: Season 1 Quack Pack

I've managed to catch it once or twice on TV, and liked it enough that I decided to get the DVD to watch all the episodes.Seeing as how I just opened my copy, I can't really say too much about the program itself, although it looks and sounds pretty good.My complaint is the opening. There are a number of previews (ads) before the main program. You either have to fast forward through them or watch them, before you get to the main menu. Each and every time you put the disc in and play it. You can't just hit the chapter skip button and go through them. What gives? That's the only reason this disc doesn't get 5 stars.",4,"Great DVD, but....",1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,678,"['really', 'odd', 'neat', 'little', 'piece', 'animation', ""'ve"", 'managed', 'catch', 'once', 'twice', 'TV', 'liked', 'decided', 'get', 'DVD', 'watch', 'episodes.Seeing', 'how', 'just', 'opened', 'copy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'say', 'too', 'much', 'program', 'pretty', 'good.My', 'complaint', 'opening', 'are', 'number', 'previews', 'ads', 'main', 'program', 'either', 'have', 'fast', 'forward', 'watch', 'get', 'main', 'menu', 'time', 'put', 'disc', 'play', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'hit', 'chapter', 'skip', 'button', 'go', 'What', 'only', 'reason', 'disc', ""n't"", 'get', '5', 'stars']",Sitting Ducks: Season 1 Quack Pack
