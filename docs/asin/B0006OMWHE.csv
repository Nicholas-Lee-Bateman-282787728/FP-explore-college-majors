Elsner ""Alan Elsner, author""","[2, 3]","Meggy, a silly Italian 14-year-old intent on losing her virginity, takes a trip to a Greek island -- ""the Island of Love"" -- with her 30-year-old aunt, Stephania, who has just broken off an eight-year relationship. The island seems to be populated solely by young people intent on partying, drinking, sun-bathing, getting high and making love.Various trivial complications ensue, the ex-boyfriend shows up and proves to be just as moody and immature as everyone else -- and there is also a weird Bollywood interlude where the principals lip-sync and dance to a song hailing the positive attributes of smoking.The main attraction here is Meggy's strange misconceptions of what it means to be an adult -- but all the characters are terminally childish, shallow and uninteresting.Sorry, can't really recommend this much.

We thought it was cute and enjoyable fluff and - as others have noted here - it's interesting to get a slice-of-life look at party island life in Greece, literally and no doubt accurately depicted as swarmed by young singles from around the world.  One of director Daniele Luchetti's interesting touches is to intersperse eight or so moments where real-life revelers introduce themselves to the camera.  No doubt this movie sent the tourist travel to Ios Island through the roof...as if it needed it.Not much to say about the movie itself.  It was pretty hard for me to shake off the overwhelmingly annoying character of Megghy (Martina Merlino) as a self-centered 14-year-old ham-handedly attempting to lose her virginity.  We needed less of Merlino and more of the winsome Stefania Montorsi - naturally beautiful and likable in the Giovanna Mezzogiorno mold.",3,Hard to shake off the overwhelmingly annoying character of Megghy,1204329600,"03 1, 2008",2008,905,"['Ginger', 'Cinnamon', 'funny', 'moments', 'thought', 'was', 'cute', 'enjoyable', 'fluff', 'others', 'have', 'noted', 'here', 'interesting', 'get', 'slice-of-life', 'look', 'party', 'island', 'life', 'Greece', 'literally', 'doubt', 'accurately', 'depicted', 'swarmed', 'young', 'singles', 'world', 'One', 'director', 'Daniele', 'Luchetti', 'interesting', 'touches', 'intersperse', 'eight', 'so', 'moments', 'where', 'real-life', 'revelers', 'introduce', 'camera', 'doubt', 'movie', 'sent', 'tourist', 'travel', 'Ios', 'Island', 'roof', 'needed', 'it.Not', 'much', 'say', 'movie', 'was', 'pretty', 'hard', 'shake', 'off', 'overwhelmingly', 'annoying', 'character', 'Megghy', 'Martina', 'Merlino', 'self-centered', '14-year-old', 'ham-handedly', 'attempting', 'lose', 'virginity', 'needed', 'less', 'Merlino', 'more', 'winsome', 'Stefania', 'Montorsi', 'naturally', 'beautiful', 'likable', 'Giovanna', 'Mezzogiorno', 'mold']",N/A

Not since ""His Girl Friday"" have so many words been squeezed into so little time. It's fun.Here's the scoop. Stephania has just broken up with her guy Andrea. She's a bit anal and loopy. Now her niece, Megghy, is on the verge of turning 15. She drags auntie to a Greek Island so she can lose her virginity. She draws a bead on ""THE"" guy who she figures is the one to help her. What she doesn't realize is that this guy is the guy her aunt just broke up with. Whackiness ensues in this loopy, comical farce.This is a fun flick. Megghy is a total whack job. She's a bit (maybe more than a bit) chunky and is almost always in this brief bikini, so the audience is aware of her budding sexuality. But when she runs it's all arms and legs in every which direction so the viewer is reminded she's still a kid. And she rattles on without so much as a comma. Some seemed to find this annoying. I liked it because it wasn't idle chatter. She was always making a point. She wants to be deflowered and it's all she can think and talk about. Then there's Stephania. She is also involved in the concept of a relationship and, in the back of her mind, why hers failed. She fools herself constantly. Chocolate is good diet food because it gives you energy to move more and lose weight. (As though she needed to). And trying to turn good things about her ex into bad things so she doesn't need to shoulder any blame.This is shot well. Good attention is payed to the Island so you get the sense of beauty and romance. There were also some interesting editing techniques. I liked the soundtrack as well. It's a good mixture of Mediterranean music and 80's American pop. This was another big surprise. A huge percentage of the cultural references, (music, movies, TV) were American. Was this an attempt to capture an American audience or are we that influential over the globe. It was a real hoot.This is a cute, fun movie. The final scene, set on a bus with Stephania and Andrea, had to be influenced by ""The Graduate."" It was a nice nod.

WOW - Viewers will really have to suspend disbelief for this one. Since when does an adult in charge of a minor (a 14 year old girl determined to lose her virginity, no less) let her charge run unsupervised day and night on a partying Greek island? The over abundance of coincidences are eye-rolling as well. Speaking of eyes, I nearly had to put toothpicks in mine to stay awake before the movie ended.Nevertheless, I'm giving ""Ginger and Cinnamon"" a generous three stars, since it is merely dopey instead of obnoxiously offensive, and I realize that ""dopey"" equals ""entertaining"" to some.

871733,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0006OMWHE,Lee Armstrong,"[4, 4]","Daniele Luchetti's 8th feature as a director is a lighthearted comedy about love.  Martina Merlino in her first film (that I could find) plays 14-year-old Meggy who travels with her aunt to the Greek Island of Ios.  The aunt played by Stefania Montorsi who also was a screenwriter for the film and has appeared in Italian films (translated titles) ""Little Teachers"" & ""Other Men.""  She's a youthful aunt of 30 who is trying to get over a breakup with her boyfriend Andrea, albeit not successfully as she continually calls leaving messages for him.  Unbeknownst to the ladies, Andrea has also headed to Ios to draw.  Meggy meets Andrea for the first time and is determined to lose her virginity to him.  Meanwhile Aunt Stefania meets young Pippo who wants to lose his virginity to Stefania.  Pippo is played by Alberto Cucca and looks the part of the young man @ the beach.  The various attempts by Meggy to snare Andrea finally result in he & Stefania meeting with fallout from their breakup flying furiously.  The film has a very good-natured conclusion with all concerned learning lessons from love.  This is a sweet film for romantics of all ages.
