1631253,ANYDQIA5YVBMM,B00BEIYNIW,Alan Ramirez,"[1, 1]","I bet I'm not the only one that is tired of the Paranormal Activity movies or the countless movies that involve a possession or the devil. So, when I saw the trailer of &#34;You're Next&#34;, I expected a good fun slasher, and it's what it delivered.The story is pretty easy to follow: an unknown murderer wants to kill a family without any apparent reason. But that's just a little bit of what the movie is about. The movie shows how a &#34;normal&#34; family would react to a situation similar to the one of this film, there's not the typical group of a slasher, it's just a family. The deaths are pretty cool, some of them graphic when they have to be graphic and others not, so, it's not exactly a bloodfest if you're expecting that from this movie.Also, Sharni Vinson proves that she has the abilty to carry a movie on her shoulders, I hope she keeps acting in horror movies.But the best part of the movie is the big twist. The twist is something so unexpected and it changes the whole view of the story from one minute to another.Overall, &#34;You're Next&#34; is a good fun ride and good enough to be memorable; it's a great break from some tired movie sagas that need to end already.

Newcomer director Adam Wingard (V/H/S [DVD]) and writer Simon Barrett (""V/H/S"") have hit one out of the park with this starts-off-being-a-slasher film that quickly transforms into a thriller/suspense/survivalist flick!Die Hardfans rejoice! Only, instead of a high-rise building, it's a giant backwoods mansion that the victims must survive. The movie is simple. A family comes together for the parents' 35th wedding anniversary, only things go awry when someone starts killing off the guests. Sounds like every other story we're used to seeing in a home invasion thriller; however, things change for the killer -- and the audience -- when one of the guests starts fighting back. I have to say -- this is a film where the pacing doesn't rest, the music is creepy and intense (think cheesy-yet-creepy 1980s synth, but it's cool!), and the twists and turns in the story keep the audience guessing and satisfied.

Through conversations and encounters, we get some insights in the mind of the characters and their family life and their complex problems. One does get a certain premonition that mayhem is about to begin but we are unprepared for what will happen next. This is a family who is in a cold war and gather together despite their problems but the party is short lived as someone in animal masks with cross bows start killing these people. As the evening progresses and the body count rises, we come to know the true intention of these killers and who is going to survive this attack and this is why the movie was so much fun.

1631266,AMYWL00JMEZXA,B00BEIYNIW,bugman,"[9, 9]","i found the over-saturation of previews for you're next to be tiresome, and was not particularly drawn to it. then a friend highly recommended it, so he, my brother, and i set down to watch it.instantly, I was drawn in. earlier in the day, while heading out to a budhist temple in the country, my family drove through super affluent, mansion-riddled neighborhoods and i started fixating on the notion of a horror movie set in such an enclave. the opening shots of this movie are gorgeous, establishing the setting, and letting us know exactly what our victims are like. a typical bickering, dysfunctional, rich family gathers to celebrate their parents' anniversary, bringing together the children and their various romantic partners. one brother establishes himself as the alpha bully, systematically targeting his sibling's boyfriends and girlfriends about their careers and life choices. and then...BOOM!when this movie get's rolling, it's like a breath of fresh air. instead of spending 40 banal minutes getting a rote intro to the characters and their relationships, you're next lets us get to know them while they are under assault, unseen, unknown, unexpected. quickly, the family begins to show its' true stripes, the cowards cowering, and the heroes rising. the family scrambles to escape, survive, and prepare. it is in the films first arc, that you're next is thoroughly disturbing and unsettling; the bf's and gf's don't engender too much sympathy, but watching family members weep over their loved ones is excruciating, particularly one death early on that shows that this movie is serious about its' mission: to be uncompromising.so, as the family struggles to survive their unseen assailants, whom we see dressed in animal masks and using a variety of weapons (it's really slasher heaven), we are assaulted by a variety of sounds and instruments, bowel-loosening tuba blasts, and hackle-raising string assaults. and then...this dark and disturbing movie changes tone with complete deftness. the dark, close-up camera that gives unbearable purview of the victims and survivors, gives way to something more energetic, more eighties, and more rousing. it's so brilliantly done, and my brother, friend, and i looked at each other at the exact same moment and said ""did you see that? did you see what they just did"" the music is a major propulsion in this change, and you start to hear the inspiration and influence of john carpenter and goblin as the score becomes synth-based. it's just beautiful. a rapid fire succession of very clear references to a nightmare on elm street, halloween, escape from new york, dawn of the dead, rear window, the evil dead, and zombi pile up on one another in 5 minutes of inspired brilliance.one character in particular, erin, played by sharni vinson, really establishes a smart, resilient presence, so much so, that she is an obvious amalgam of fright cinema's proud tradition of final girls, most notably nancy thompson, laurie strode, and kirsty cotton. vinson will have you on your feet, and appreciating director adam wingard's understanding of clover's trope, and the awesomely 80's-esque execution of it. vinson is totally powerful, displaying resourcefulness, toughness, smarts, and just general a$$-kickery. verily, she was awesome.wingard is really working it, and you're next is just 90 efficient minutes of awesome. the camera is superb, delivering beautiful exterior shots, beginning with a bunch of voyeuristic close-ups before the animals are out in the open, and then perfect wide shots that deliver very clear presentations of the ratcheted-up action.i loved this movie. it was fresh and an exciting, and did some really nice, courageous things.

Yes notes, on what was wrong and what I found to be stupid in terms of the characters decisions and what not. I also found myself talking to my monitor..asking why are they so dumb? So bear with me..it'll all make sense once you read till the end. No major spoilers, just my commentary.1) Don't be shocked when you start rooting for some of them to die. Some of them are real dckwads, so it's okay.2) Arrows are being shot at you, why are you still standing up? Sure you're shocked by what's going on but shouldn't you'reimmediate reaction be to drop to the floor?3) And I can't stress this enough when it comes to horror flicks, whyyy in the world would any one suggest to split up or suggestone or more persons to go and find help? Why? Just stick together and go from there..4) Why would you agree and let your daughter run outside to get help without knowing who or what is out there? For all we knowthere could be 30 or 5 people out there capable of doing god knows what.5) And lets just say she IS the fastest runner in the family, ok cool....but is she freakin faster than a shooting arrow? Can sheout run it? NO.6) As the killings begin you will realize that Erin is the smartest and most sensible character in the movie who actually takesinitiative due to the fact that she had survival training.7) Why would you leave your wife upstairs alone? What makes you think she's any safer upstairs..alone?After or while watching the movie, you probably wondered why the writers made the other characters so stupid w/ the exception of Erin. When Erin bashed one of the invaders to death I literally shouted and cheered. Why? Because she didn't just hit him once then ran away like most people in horror flicks. When you have a chance to &#34;finish them&#34; while they're down, you do it. Don'tgive them the opportunity to recover and chase after you again. With that said, Erin is a very worthy &#34;final girl&#34;..even if the writers purposely made her the heroine. Everyone else was an idiot so that she can shine and that worked for the movie. It wasn't until the end of the film that I remembered that it was a horror COMEDY. Everything now all makes sense. No way characters can be that dumb. The film is only getting 3 stars b/c I enjoyed Erin kicking everyone's ass.

1631272,A6J7UPYUI96XO,B00BEIYNIW,"Cory T. Shaeffer ""HockeyFanatic""","[2, 3]","Warning: this review contains spoilers!!This is not your typical home invasion film. We've seen others (The Strangers, Funny Games, Mother's Day, etc.) and they were entertaining, but for the most part, you knew where they were going. With ""You're Next,"" that isn't always the case. There are some twists here, none of which are earth shattering, but they are believable to an extent within the context of the film's setting. At times, it's hard to feel bad for the wealthy, petulant family in the beginning of the invasion, when they start getting picked off one by one. Then, Sharni Vinson's character takes an epic turn, as she turns out to have a special skill set that nobody saw coming. Once she gets going, it's impossible not to root for her as she proceeds to brutally take revenge against the armed invaders one by one, using everything from blenders to meat cleavers, booby-trapping the house Macaulay Culkin style, foiling the criminals with a MacGyver-like cunning precision.There are a few laughs here and there too, almost as if the film acknowledges that by the cheesy title and concept, that it's a cliche before it even hits the screen. As the saying goes, however, sometimes you know where a movie is going but it's fun watching it get there. This is the ultimate example of a movie in which you think you know where it's going, and then it takes a satisfying, bloody turn that horror fans will love. There's gore, revenge, devastation, suspense, action, and twists. This film never lets up, becoming easily one of the year's best horror films, not to mention a landmark performance (Vinson) for female leads in horror films.

1631273,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYNIW,C. Sawin,"[2, 8]","There had been a lot of buzz surrounding director Adam Wingard's and writer Simon Barrett's (""V/H/S,"" ""V/H/S/2,"" ""The ABCs of Death"") horror film ""You're Next"" leading up to its August 23 release. Debuting at Fantastic Fest nearly two years ago, early reviews for ""You're Next"" called the film ""unpredictable"" and that it even ""restored faith in the horror genre."" If you're a fan of horror, then this is something to get excited about. Unfortunately, ""You're Next"" falls extremely short of expectations and collapses under the weight of its own hype.Certain sequences in the film leave an incredible impact; usually when the actors aren't talking. The intruders wearing masks are much more menacing when you see them coming through a window in slow-motion carrying an axe or a crossbow. Seeing their reflection as you're looking through a window watching someone in the kitchen is genuinely creepy. The score is partially industrial as it utilizes sounds and noises more than anything else. Sometimes it works really well and helps establish the unsettling atmosphere of the film. Other times, it just gets annoying and you'll be sick of that song that repeats over and over again long before the end credits roll.The characters are written so absent mindedly that it's on the verge of world record stupidity. The benefit is that it only makes each kill that much sweeter. There are also at least two jump scares that will legitimately make you leap out of your chair. The Erin character is really the only one that's worthwhile. It's always great to see a strong female in a horror film, but Erin takes it to an entirely different level. A certain kill involving a kitchen appliance will more than likely keep you talking, too.The film is really disappointing otherwise. The way the characters are written is horrible. Their logic is really bad even by horror film standards. Running full speed at a closed door after intruders make it very well known that they're trying to kill you is the dumbest thing you could ever do and shoving the contents of an entire toolbox into someone's chest as a shocking reveal doesn't really fix things. Now the puns are flowing. The story is pretty poor, too. Without giving too much away, it's not nearly as unpredictable as people are saying it is. In fact, you can see where the story is going pretty clearly around the halfway point. The tells are in the actors faces.The conversation at the dinner table involving Tariq being a filmmaker and Drake's feedback are ridiculous. It's party absurd, partly idiotic, and partly amusing. It's then followed by some of the most unbearable shaky camera moments to be featured in a film this year. It's like the entire sequence was filmed during a record breaking earthquake. The bickering amongst the family is awful and the women are so melodramatic that it's painful.There was hope that ""You're Next"" was going to turn it around in its final act. The original ""Saw"" was extremely low budget and had some pretty terrible acting at times, but turned it around with a jaw-dropping finale. The anticipation built up for the film made ""You're Next"" seem like this year's ""The Cabin in the Woods."" ""You're Next"" doesn't really follow through though. Its poor writing, bad acting, and stupidly predictable outcome ruin the few good things the film has going for it. There are hints of films like ""Funny Games"" and ""The Strangers"" in ""You're Next,"" but it's more like ""The Collection"" in the sense that it's all gore and little else.",2,A wolf in sheep's clothing,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,3509,"['had', 'been', 'lot', 'buzz', 'surrounding', 'director', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'writer', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'V/H/S', 'V/H/S/2', 'ABCs', 'Death', 'horror', 'film', ""'re"", 'Next', 'leading', 'up', 'August', '23', 'release', 'Debuting', 'Fantastic', 'Fest', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'early', 'reviews', ""'re"", 'Next', 'called', 'film', 'unpredictable', 'even', 'restored', 'faith', 'horror', 'genre', ""'re"", 'fan', 'horror', 'then', 'something', 'get', 'excited', 'about', 'Unfortunately', ""'re"", 'Next', 'extremely', 'short', 'expectations', 'collapses', 'weight', 'own', 'hype.Certain', 'sequences', 'film', 'leave', 'incredible', 'impact', 'usually', 'when', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'talking', 'intruders', 'wearing', 'masks', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'menacing', 'when', 'see', 'coming', 'window', 'slow-motion', 'carrying', 'axe', 'crossbow', 'Seeing', 'reflection', ""'re"", 'looking', 'window', 'watching', 'someone', 'kitchen', 'genuinely', 'creepy', 'score', 'partially', 'industrial', 'sounds', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'Sometimes', 'really', 'well', 'establish', 'unsettling', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'Other', 'times', 'just', 'annoying', ""'ll"", 'be', 'sick', 'song', 'over', 'again', 'long', 'end', 'roll.The', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'so', 'absent', 'mindedly', 'verge', 'world', 'record', 'stupidity', 'benefit', 'only', 'kill', 'much', 'sweeter', 'are', 'also', 'least', 'two', 'jump', 'scares', 'will', 'legitimately', 'make', 'leap', 'chair', 'Erin', 'character', 'really', 'only', 'one', 'worthwhile', 'always', 'great', 'see', 'strong', 'female', 'horror', 'film', 'Erin', 'entirely', 'different', 'level', 'certain', 'kill', 'involving', 'kitchen', 'appliance', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'keep', 'talking', 'too.The', 'film', 'really', 'disappointing', 'otherwise', 'way', 'characters', 'are', 'written', 'horrible', 'logic', 'really', 'bad', 'even', 'horror', 'film', 'standards', 'Running', 'full', 'speed', 'closed', 'door', 'intruders', 'make', 'very', 'well', 'known', ""'re"", 'trying', 'kill', 'dumbest', 'thing', 'could', 'ever', 'do', 'shoving', 'contents', 'entire', 'toolbox', 'someone', 'chest', 'shocking', 'reveal', ""n't"", 'really', 'fix', 'things', 'Now', 'puns', 'are', 'flowing', 'story', 'pretty', 'poor', 'too', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'unpredictable', 'people', 'are', 'saying', 'fact', 'can', 'see', 'where', 'story', 'going', 'pretty', 'clearly', 'halfway', 'point', 'tells', 'are', 'actors', 'faces.The', 'conversation', 'dinner', 'table', 'involving', 'Tariq', 'being', 'filmmaker', 'Drake', 'feedback', 'are', 'ridiculous', 'party', 'absurd', 'partly', 'idiotic', 'partly', 'amusing', 'then', 'followed', 'most', 'unbearable', 'shaky', 'camera', 'moments', 'be', 'featured', 'film', 'year', 'entire', 'sequence', 'was', 'filmed', 'record', 'breaking', 'earthquake', 'bickering', 'family', 'awful', 'women', 'are', 'so', 'melodramatic', 'painful.There', 'was', 'hope', ""'re"", 'Next', 'was', 'going', 'turn', 'around', 'final', 'act', 'original', 'Saw', 'was', 'extremely', 'low', 'budget', 'had', 'pretty', 'terrible', 'acting', 'times', 'turned', 'around', 'jaw-dropping', 'finale', 'anticipation', 'built', 'up', 'film', 'made', ""'re"", 'Next', 'seem', 'year', 'Cabin', 'Woods', ""'re"", 'Next', ""n't"", 'really', 'follow', 'though', 'poor', 'writing', 'bad', 'acting', 'stupidly', 'predictable', 'outcome', 'ruin', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'film', 'going', 'are', 'hints', 'films', 'Funny', 'Games', 'Strangers', ""'re"", 'Next', 'more', 'Collection', 'sense', 'gore', 'little', 'else']",You're Next

I am, however, a fan of horror with brains, that takes a realistic approach to its subject matter, without holding anything back, that sets out to do nothing more than creep you out.YOU'RE NEXT is such a film.  The premise is fairly simple: a family decides to get together in a rural house for a wedding anniversary.  Unbeknownst to them, they aren't the only ones who've been planning for this occasion.  Very quickly, tensions escalate, tempers flare...and that's before a band of strangers begins to brutally murder everyone.Director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett keep things nice and organic; the acting (from a largely unknown cast) is superb and realistic, as is the gore (yes, there's a lot, though the gratuity is used for parodic effect).  It's nice to see a horror film with few pretensions, some actual scares, a thoroughly creepy vibe, and a genuinely strong female protagonist (Erin isn't some Amazonian goddess; she's actually a strong woman who just happens to have a background that makes her well-suited to fighting back).

It is packed with twists, strong characters, and truly artful cinematic technique.  It eschews traditional horror film plotting, and does not shy away from expectations of gore and violence in its genre.  There is of course a generous amount of comic satire.  The film's only fault is that it doesn't take itself seriously enough.  It is such a magnum opus in the canon of home invasion slasher pictures that the punchline of an ending almost feels insufficient.  Think The Royal Tenenbaums crossed with Friday the 13th.Adam Wingard's direction and editing here reveal true virtuoso film making.  He doesn't just create spooky moments, but has full poetic control of rising tension in the entire film.  He lingers in key moments of the film, emphasizing actor's expressions, portraying the action in excruciating detail.  The soundtrack carenes from a diegetic realism, using one song by Dwight Twilley, to a soundtrack with full on synthesizers in the films final scenes.

1631290,A1KONL8ECYFG37,B00BEIYNIW,DVD Verdict,"[2, 3]","You're Next isn't just my favorite horror in a long time; it's one of my favorite movies of the year in any genre.Unlike some of my other favorite horror movies of recent years, You're Next isn't about a whole lot more than it's about. It has none of the political implications of The Woman and isn't interested in the meta deconstructionism of The Cabin in the Woods. This is not to say it contains no subtext; director Adam Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett are clearly interested in blowing up some genre conventions and tweaking the traditional role of the Final Girl. But that stuff is secondary. More than anything, it's a movie that's incredibly good at being scary, suspenseful, funny, entertaining, and FUN; a testament to having solid foundations&#8212;good writing, good direction, good cast. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, it just rolls it really well.There's a case to be made that You're Next is secretly about relationships&#8212;the things we do and do not tell our partners, and the ways in which revealing those details can impact what we previously thought was a happy union. I know none of that sounds very scary, so please don't think the movie is some Kate Hudson romantic comedy passing itself off as a horror film. The horror here works; Wingard knows how to set up and pay off tension for maximum effect, and You're Next doesn't pull any punches with its intensity. But what makes the film special is that it isn't only about scares and intensity. It's very, very funny and a whole lot of fun.I have little patience for the home invasion movie, whether it's Funny Games, or The Strangers, or The Purge, or Funny Games (2008), or whatever. This may be because I find them too horrifying; life is terrible enough without feeling like people in masks are going to break into my house and kill my family. The argument could be made that I avoid these movies because they work, which is what good horror movies are supposed to do. With You're Next, it's as if Wingard and Barrett sensed my unease (the world is all about me) and came up with a solution. What that solution is I won't say, but the pair managed to take a genre I typically avoid and spin it into one of my favorite movies of the year.Anyone who has been waiting for Adam Wingard to blow up should hopefully see it happen after this. There was a ton of good stuff in A Horrible Way to Die&#8212;a horror movie told as sensitive indie drama, and one I like more every time I see it&#8212;but some of the directing choices got in the way of the otherwise strong emotional connections. His contributions to recent horror anthologies like V/H/S, V/H/S/2, and The ABCs of Death have been mixed, with some good ideas and a solid streak of humor (in the latter two), but I hadn't yet seen Wingard firing on every cylinder. That would be You're Next, a movie that understands how to build a scare, how to create sympathetic characters in a short amount of time and, most importantly, gets the tone just right. It's a home invasion/slasher movie that doesn't feel mean spirited. For once, we're not supposed to be rooting for the killers. We like these characters&#8212;even the ones who are introduced as douchebags&#8212;and we want them to survive. That's a testament to the performances of the cast, many of them indie film veterans and directors themselves, all creating memorable characters that are more than just pencil outlines. Pay attention to the ways in which everyone behaves when the bad things start&#8212;who does and who does not try to help, who is brave and who isn't. It goes against our initial impressions, and is just one more example of how clever the movie is.Lionsgate's You're Next (Blu-ray) does a good job with very deliberate cinematography. The 2.40:1/1080p HD transfer retains the film's graininess and muted color scheme; it's not nearly as polished as some other, bigger budget releases, but that's never what the filmmakers intended. The lossless 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track keeps the dialogue audible while doing its best to enhance the scares with solid ambient presence and strong low end. Wingard and Barrett appear on not one but two commentary tracks. On the first, they're joined by stars Sharni Vinson and Barbara Crampton for a fun and relaxed behind-the-scenes chat; on the second (which they admit they opted to record because they left so much out of the first talk) they get more into production details but never lose their sense of humor. If you've heard a commentary from Wingard and Barrett before, you know how loose and entertaining they can be. The commentaries on You're Next continue that tradition. The only other bonus features&#8212;besides the excellent (if a bit misleading) trailer and standard DVD copy&#8212;is a short featurette that's absolutely loaded with spoilers. Watch it only after if you've seen the movie.Patrick Bromley, VerdictRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",5,There are so many clever touches,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,4925,"[""'re"", 'Next',

1631292,ADWQPR0LJD4J,B00BEIYNIW,"ERSInk . com ""Eric""","[0, 0]","I've been excited to see &#34;You're Next&#34; ever since reading about it what seems like over a year ago. Sometimes it takes indie genre films a while to find the right distributor and studio that will give it a chance. &#34;Everybody Loves Mandy Lane&#34; is an extreme example of the long time it can take for a movie to make it from festival to Blu-ray and DVD release. I can honestly say that the wait for this home invasion/slasher/horror mutation was worth the wait.Crispian and his fiancee, Erin, travel to his family's rural Missouri vacation house to celebrate the anniversary of his mother and father. His brothers and sister join them at the secluded mansion for the festivities. As the dysfunctional bunch sit down for a nice dinner, they are brutally attacked by a trio of armed killers. The group must now find a way to survive and fight for their lives as the masked murderers attempt to pick them off one by one.Although &#34;You're Next&#34; isn't perfect or the most original film to be released, it does its job as a thriller and slasher piece. There are some nice twists and turns in the plot, even if you see them heading at you. I compare it to riding a rollercoaster for the third time, but still being excited and taken aback when you hit that familiar loop you know is coming.The DVD version of &#34;You're Next&#34; includes some bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Adam Wingard, Writer Simon Barrett and actors Sharni Vinson and Barbara Crampton. There's also a featurette entitled &#34;No Ordinary Home Invasion: The Making of 'You're Next'&#34; and a theatrical trailer.&#34;You're Next&#34; is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sensuality/nudity. A lot of blood is shed as you would imagine. The nudity is brief and just at the beginning of the film. It's completely unnecessary as usual and adds nothing to the big picture.There's really no message or lesson to be found in &#34;You're Next.&#34; I guess you can stretch and say it warns not to trust anyone. It might also encourage some to take a survivalist class to learn how to live in the wild and be prepared for anything. Aside from that, it's just a gory and gruesome thrill ride.&#34;You're Next&#34; will excite fans of home invasion films like &#34;The Strangers,&#34; &#34;Cherry Tree Lane,&#34; and even &#34;The Purge.&#34; I consider it to be highly recommendable to genre enthusiasts. One bonus offered by the movie is the chance to see the director of the lame &#34;The House of the Devil&#34; flick, Ti West, die a horrible death.

The basic plot has been done before in horror genre but this one rewrites it well.  Basically a well off family is having a reunion at their parent's holiday home in the rural isolated countryside.  Unbeknownst to them a group of men dressed in farm animal masks slashed up their neighbours down the road the day before they all arrived.  Their dysfunctional family dinner is about to get interrupted.I quite enjoyed this one, it does have your yelling at the screen why would you do that moments (directed at both the family under siege and bad guys), but I actually think this an enjoyable part of these types of films.  Obviously the bad guys could have achieved their goals with a lot less risk to themselves but killing each victim differently is a lot better to watch than doing it simpler and more affectively. Some kills also rely on a lot of factors following their fantasy exactly to come off such (spoiler scene alert) as fishing wire needing to be at an exact height of the victim when how would you know which victim it's going to be. Some things occur that aren't possible in the time frame such as writing in blood You're Next on a Wall when others would have arrived seconds later after the screams. The villains weren't as dim-witted as say the ones in Home Alone but the traps inside the house were a lot deadlier too.  Although (spoiler alert for another scene) why the lamb guy looked through the window and saw wood with nails through them and then thought I'll step on that anyway, yet was surprised it hurt I can't fathom.I thought the family didn't act entirely like people in this situation would, especially the mother who really should have taken on a protect her children status. Granted she obviously wasn't a fan of any of her children's partners but she should have at least put her own well being behind that of her own kids. She should have been the first one to put her hand up for the high risk get help scene near the start.  But then again I guess there are people like that in the real world.  Plus having unlikeable character as really all the family were, makes it more fun to watch them get killed each time. I actually liked how none of the characters are played by big name actors.I'd give it four and a half stars and recommend it for anyone who is a fan of the genre.",5,This Should Be Your Next Slasher / Family Targeted by Violent Home Inaders Movie Selection,1392940800,"02 21, 2014",2014,2424,"['do', ""n't"", 'make', 'lot', 'simple', 'satisfying', 'watch', 'slasher/terrorise', 'group', 'people', 'flicks', 'days', 'basic', 'plot', 'been', 'done', 'horror', 'genre', 'one', 'well', 'Basically', 'well', 'family', 'having', 'reunion', 'parent', 'holiday', 'home', 'rural', 'isolated', 'countryside', 'Unbeknownst', 'group', 'men', 'dressed', 'farm', 'animal', 'masks', 'slashed', 'up', 'neighbours', 'down', 'road', 'day', 'arrived', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'dinner', 'get', 'interrupted.I', 'quite', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'have', 'yelling', 'screen', 'why', 'would', 'do', 'moments', 'directed', 'family', 'siege', 'bad', 'guys', 'actually', 'think', 'enjoyable', 'part', 'types', 'films', 'Obviously', 'bad', 'guys', 'could', 'have', 'achieved', 'goals', 'lot', 'less', 'risk', 'killing', 'victim', 'differently', 'lot', 'better', 'watch', 'doing', 'simpler', 'more', 'affectively', 'kills', 'also', 'rely', 'lot', 'factors', 'following', 'fantasy', 'exactly', 'come', 'off', 'such', 'spoiler', 'scene', 'alert', 'fishing', 'wire', 'needing', 'be', 'exact', 'height', 'victim', 'when', 'how', 'would', 'know', 'victim', 'going', 'be', 'things', 'occur', 'are', ""n't"", 'possible', 'time', 'frame', 'such', 'writing', 'blood', ""'re"", 'Next', 'Wall', 'when', 'others', 'would', 'have', 'arrived', 'seconds', 'later', 'screams', 'villains', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'dim-witted', 'say', 'ones', 'Home', 'Alone', 'traps', 'house', 'were', 'lot', 'deadlier', 'too', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'scene', 'why', 'lamb', 'guy', 'looked', 'window', 'saw', 'wood', 'nails', 'then', 'thought', ""'ll"", 'step', 'anyway', 'was', 'surprised', 'hurt', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fathom.I', 'thought', 'family', 'did', ""n't"", 'act', 'entirely', 'like', 'people', 'situation', 'would', 'especially', 'mother', 'who', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'taken', 'protect', 'children', 'status', 'Granted', 'obviously', 'was', ""n't"", 'fan', 'children', 'partners', 'should', 'have', 'least', 'put', 'own', 'well', 'being', 'own', 'kids', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'first', 'one', 'put', 'hand', 'up', 'high', 'risk', 'get', 'help', 'scene', 'start', 'then', 'again', 'guess', 'are', 'people', 'real', 'world', 'having', 'unlikeable', 'character', 'really', 'family', 'were', 'more', 'fun', 'watch', 'get', 'killed', 'time', 'actually', 'liked', 'how', 'none', 'characters', 'are', 'played', 'big', 'name', 'actors.I', ""'d"", 'give', 'four', 'half', 'stars', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'fan', 'genre']",You're Next

I've been used to such crappy storylines, ""advanced"" special effects, and cliches galore that it would seem like I would be able to predict every person's every move. That was the first five minutes (which includes the only sex scene in the movie). After that, I was very well surprised by a story of family reunion, familial tension, backstory, and just as surprised as the rest of the people when the heroine turned out to be more like a Joss Whedon-made feminine character: strong, independent, very smart, etc.In other words, she knows how to hold her own.And not only is that angle unique, there were several death scenes that implemented unique styles that I've never seen in any ""decent"" horror movie.Even though the movie was quite unique in terms of an actually strong female hero (oh wait, there's also the lass in Evil Dead) and a disturbing conspiracy behind the killings, I did think it could have done well with a little less swearing (that seemed a little overdone a couple of times) and the ending shot?

1631302,A1AQBOWEL8TROJ,B00BEIYNIW,Jean-ren Leroux,"[1, 5]","*** Warning: spoilers aheadOnce you&#8217;ve come to term with the fact that you need to be a bit sick in the head in order to make (and watch &#8211; I include myself) such a movie, you can sort of dissect it for what it is: a pretentious, somewhat original good old slasher movie&#8230; but a good old slasher movie just the same. With all the usual dumb stuff in it that nobody normal would never ever do.With that being said, I don&#8217;t know what is more terrifying: the story itself or the intentions of the creators that you can hear in the extras. And for that matter, the reaction people have when you read the reviews on Amazon are just as weird, If not worrying. The people behind this film and some of the fans are talking about a comedy, a funnier horror film, a re-invention of the genre, original and new ways of killing people, lots of gore and so on. Wow&#8230; I enjoy horror flicks but&#8230; to that extent? We all have a darker side and these kinds of movies, not only are giving us a rush of adrenaline, yes, and are also acting as some sort of outlet. I get that. But should we take that much pleasure in it? Shouldn&#8217;t we be more responsible in our appreciation of that kind of release of more violent urges? Anyhow, that is not really my point here. What I mostly wanted to talk about was the pretentions of the people involved in this story.  Especially when they are talking about &#8216;&#8217;taking the genre to a whole new level&#8217;&#8217;. Really?There is truly exciting stuff in this film. The fact that we&#8217;re discovering the characters while jumping immediately into the action is worth mentioning (instead of wasting twenty minutes of useless intros). Boum! There is it is. One person dies in front of everybody, the killers revealing their intentions right away. No two ways about it. The movie is not even 10 minutes long. Although not original, it is refreshing to say the least. Also, at some point, there is a reversal of situation in which the usual passive and responsible heroine is instead taking charge and, in a way, becoming the hunter, making a &#8216;&#8217;Rambo&#8217;&#8217; out of herself.  We are starting to root for her, identifying ourselves in her courage and resourcefulness along the way. Again, while it may not necessarily be original, it is nevertheless distinctive (although it is becoming a trend &#8211; I&#8217;m thinking of &#8216;&#8217;I Spit On Your Grave&#8217;&#8217; and others).There stops the so-called &#8216;&#8217;originality&#8217;&#8217;. Along come the usual clich&eacute;s, poor story devices and dumb reactions. First, the weak character development. Why wouldn&#8217;t you psychologically prepare your girlfriend to meet your &#8216;&#8217;weird&#8217;&#8217; family? Why would you simply say to her: &#8216;&#8217;you&#8217;ll see&#8217;&#8217;? What mother sends her new son&#8217;s girlfriend to a stranger&#8217;s house, in the woods, in order to ask for milk? Of course, the patriarch will laugh at his wife for thinking somebody is in the house. And, obviously, the strange and gothic girlfriend of one of the sons has something to do with the killings. It is written on her face. And what in the hell does the attractive and courageous heroine sees in her new boyfriend, a weak and fearful chubby, bearded half of a man? As for the &#8216;&#8217;horror&#8217;&#8217; devices, well&#8230;  Would you enter into a big isolated mansion in the woods if the front door was&#8230; strangely open? Would you still walk freely in the house if you knew somebody was inside? Would you send your own daughter outside if it was obvious the killers were there, waiting with bows and arrows? Would you go to sleep alone in your room after the killings have started and after it was obvious that those killers were inside? Who in their right mind would look under the bed? Or inside a keyhole? Who would run out of that house given the situation?So much for reinventing the genre&#8230;  Is there no way to make a genuine good and original horror film?

1631311,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B00BEIYNIW,John's Horror Corner,"[1, 4]","Horrible filmmaking...but being unexpectedly complemented by one of the best credibly tough horror heroines in the last decade makes it all worth it.Directed by Adam Wingard (V/H/S 2: Phase I Clinical Trials, V/H/S: Tape 56, The ABCs of Death: Q is for Quack) and written by Simon Barrett (V/H/S 2: Tape 49 and Phase I Clinical Trials, V/H/S: Tape 56 and Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger, The ABCs of Death: Q is for Quack), this movie failed in most respects except for excellently presenting a credibly tough female survivor character.  This is difficult to do without getting carried away, and it should be acknowledged that this is major.  However, despite their ability to entertain me with some of their short films, as filmmakers they failed me here.  I was entertained and this wasn't a bad movie experience for me, but it was all because one well-crafted character saved this movie for me.THE PLAYERS:  Parents Paul and Aubrey (Barbara Crampton; Re-Animator, Chopping Mall, From Beyond) are celebrating their 35th anniversary at their secluded house with their children Crispin and his girlfriend and the savior of this movie Erin (Sharni Vinson; Step Up 3D); Drake (Joe Swanberg; Cabin Fever 2, V/H/S) and his wife Kelly; Felix and his new girlfriend Zee; and daughter Amy  and her boyfriend Tariq (director Ti West; The Innkeepers, Cabin Fever 2).This movie approaches Vacancy and The Strangers but changes the victims from a couple to a family of ten.  Otherwise, quite similarly, the location is remote, contact to the outside world is cut off, and we don't know why our killers are trying to kill them (for a while anyway).  This premise should have the ability to be very exciting, but your thrills will be serially curbed  by the break in tempo you'll endure when you are forced to watch the characters interact with one another.Yup...it's sad. The characters are terribly written and their choices and issues seem dumb even for a horror movie--even when you consider that they're irrational and scared for their lives.  The one exception is thankfully a glowing one: Erin.  Sharni Vinson does an AMAZING job in this role!  Erin is a strong-willed woman who makes believably smart choices while remaining appropriately scared.  She maintains just enough control, avoids life-ending idiotic decisions, and when she's fighting for her life she does it credibly whether she's striking someone by surprise in the throat or recklessly jumping out a window to escape a killer.  She's never depicted as unrealistically strong, tough, invulnerable, ninja-like or brilliant.  What's great is that, however unlikely, they even provide us with a reason that she can handle herself so well under duress.Like our heroine from I Spit on Your Grave (2010), Erin goes through Hell, gets considerably hurt and accumulates several debilitating injuries, and finds most of her strength in her desperation and anger with her situation.  The major difference between the two is that nothing horrible happened to Erin for her to seek revenge.  Instead, some folks just starting killing everyone at a dinner party and she reacted in kind.The story was unoriginal, incredibly simple, and yielded a plot twist which I think you'll be expecting before they finally get around to the big reveal.  The blood, screaming, lacerations and impalements were abundant and, if you could get over the poorly written bonkers randomness of it all, there were some thrills to be had, though mostly thanks to Erin-fueled adrenaline!",3,Horrible filmmaking unexpectedly complemented w/ the best credibly tough horror heroine of the decade makes this worth a watch,1377216000,"08 23, 2013",2013,3530,"['Horrible', 'filmmaking', 'being', 'unexpectedly', 'complemented', 'one', 'best', 'credibly', 'tough', 'horror', 'heroines', 'last', 'decade', 'worth', 'it.Directed', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'V/H/S', '2', 'Phase', 'Clinical', 'Trials', 'V/H/S', 'Tape', '56', 'ABCs', 'Death', 'Q', 'Quack', 'written', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'V/H/S', '2', 'Tape', '49', 'Phase', 'Clinical', 'Trials', 'V/H/S', 'Tape', '56', 'Sick', 'Thing', 'Happened', 'Emily', 'When', 'Was', 'Younger', 'ABCs', 'Death', 'Q', 'Quack', 'movie', 'failed', 'most', 'respects', 'excellently', 'presenting', 'credibly', 'tough', 'female', 'survivor', 'character', 'difficult', 'do', 'getting', 'carried', 'away', 'should', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'major', 'However', 'ability', 'entertain', 'short', 'films', 'filmmakers', 'failed', 'here', 'was', 'entertained', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'experience', 'was', 'one', 'well-crafted', 'character', 'saved', 'movie', 'me.THE', 'PLAYERS', 'Parents', 'Paul', 'Aubrey', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'Re-Animator', 'Chopping', 'Mall', 'From', 'Beyond', 'are', 'celebrating', '35th', 'anniversary', 'secluded', 'house', 'children', 'Crispin', 'girlfriend', 'savior', 'movie', 'Erin', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'Step', 'Up', '3D', 'Drake', 'Joe', 'Swanberg', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', 'V/H/S', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Felix', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'Zee', 'daughter', 'Amy', 'boyfriend', 'Tariq', 'director', 'Ti', 'West', 'Innkeepers', 'Cabin', 'Fever', '2', '.This', 'movie', 'approaches', 'Vacancy', 'Strangers', 'victims', 'couple', 'family', 'ten', 'Otherwise', 'quite', 'similarly', 'location', 'remote', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'cut', 'off', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'killers', 'are', 'trying', 'kill', 'while', 'anyway', 'premise', 'should', 'have', 'ability', 'be', 'very', 'exciting', 'thrills', 'will', 'be', 'serially', 'curbed', 'break', 'tempo', ""'ll"", 'endure', 'when', 'are', 'forced', 'watch', 'characters', 'interact', 'one', 'another.Yup', 'sad', 'characters', 'are', 'terribly', 'written', 'choices', 'issues', 'seem', 'dumb', 'even', 'horror', 'movie', 'even', 'when', 'consider', ""'re"", 'irrational', 'scared', 'lives', 'one', 'exception', 'thankfully', 'glowing', 'one', 'Erin', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'AMAZING', 'job', 'role', 'Erin', 'strong-willed', 'woman', 'who', 'believably', 'smart', 'choices', 'remaining', 'appropriately', 'scared', 'just', 'enough', 'control', 'avoids', 'life-ending', 'idiotic', 'decisions', 'when', 'fighting', 'life', 'credibly', 'striking', 'someone', 'surprise', 'throat', 'recklessly', 'jumping', 'out', 'window', 'escape', 'killer', 'never', 'depicted', 'unrealistically', 'strong', 'tough', 'invulnerable', 'ninja-like', 'brilliant', 'What', 'great', 'however', 'unlikely', 'even', 'provide', 'reason', 'can', 'handle', 'so', 'well', 'duress.Like', 'heroine', 'Spit', 'Your', 'Grave', '2010', 'Erin', 'Hell', 'considerably', 'hurt', 'several', 'debilitating', 'injuries', 'most', 'strength', 'desperation', 'anger', 'situation', 'major', 'difference', 'two', 'nothing', 'horrible', 'happened', 'Erin', 'seek', 'revenge', 'Instead', 'folks', 'just', 'starting', 'killing', 'everyone', 'dinner', 'party', 'reacted', 'kind.The', 'story', 'was', 'unoriginal', 'incredibly', 'simple', 'yielded', 'plot', 'twist', 'think', ""'ll"", 'be', 'expecting', 'finally', 'get', 'around', 'big', 'reveal', 'blood', 'screaming', 'lacerations', 'impalements', 'were', 'abundant', 'could', 'get', 'poorly', 'written', 'bonkers', 'randomness', 'were', 'thrills', 'be', 'had', 'though', 'mostly', 'thanks', 'Erin-fueled', 'adrenaline']",You're Next

The studio does its best to keep horror fans supplied, always striving for the unique qualities we find in &#8220;You&#8217;re Next.&#8221;What begins as a slasher film, with the standard clich&eacute;s &#8211; senseless slaughter of two after sex, a bloody message &#8211; takes a unique turn about three-quarters of the way in. The maneuver helps the movie jump the hurdle on rottentomatoes.com with a 75% like from critics and a 63% appreciation from the audience.Director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett, both of &#8220;V/H/S/2,&#8221; pull out a variety of weapons, including a crossbow, ax, machete, screwdriver and blender, in a nasty home invasion story. If you recall the previews, a family is about to have a meal in a manor in the woods, when one of them is taken out by a crossbow bolt to the forehead. Much screaming and running about follows, with only one cluing the others to &#8220;Get down!&#8221; Apparently, no one there has ever seen any action-thriller or they&#8217;d know not to stand in front of well-lit windows so the gang of armed, masked killers outside can pick them off.Most of the party goes down fast while a handful stick it out to battle their attackers. The white animal masks paired with black clothing help provide some good jump-scares, while the main protagonist realistically manages to give back. A cast of good character actors &#8211; including Sharni Vinson, Nicholas Tucci, AJ Bowen, Rob Moran, Barbara Crampton and Margaret Laney &#8211; hold their own.Be aware that many think the movie is a &#8220;horror-comedy.&#8221; That alone gave me shivers. Still, in the commentary with Wingard and Barrett, they discuss how they wanted to open the movie with the death of a small dog or a baby with the requisite head left for the next victim to find along with the bloody message. The pair found this concept absolutely hilarious, but opted for something different for which I&#8217;m grateful, as the film would&#8217;ve been over for me right there. They also talk about how funny it was to have one of the victims walk around with an arrow in his back, since it didn&#8217;t kill him outright.I must be missing something in the humor department because I am still not amused, although I think the movie is a successful horror flick.A second audio commentary with Wingard, Barrett, and actors Sharni Vinson and Barbara Compton offers more serious info such as how to give a good performance in a horror movie. There is also pertinent info on how the movie was created and edited. The best of the lot is &#8220;No Ordinary Home Invasion: The Making of &#8216;You&#8217;re Next,&#8217;&#8221; a shorty with interviews from the cast, director and writer. Barrett begins by saying he wrote the film with some of the cast members in mind. All indicate how &#8220;You&#8217;re Next&#8221; is a level above standard horror films &#8211; but no, it&#8217;s not exactly a breakthrough, guys. Check out &#8220;Cabin in the Woods,&#8221; for example, which actually does manage to combine horror and comedy.That&#8217;s how you do it, folks.",5,A slash with a twist,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",2014,3102,"['HOORAY', 'FOR', 'LIONSGATE', 'studio', 'best', 'keep', 'horror', 'fans', 'supplied', 'always', 'striving', 'unique', 'qualities', 'find', '8220', '8217', 'Next.', '8221', 'What', 'slasher', 'film', 'standard', 'clich', 'eacute', '8211', 'senseless', 'slaughter', 'two', 'sex', 'bloody', 'message', '8211', 'unique', 'turn', 'three-quarters', 'way', 'maneuver', 'movie', 'jump', 'hurdle', 'rottentomatoes.com', '75', '%', 'critics', '63', '%', 'appreciation', 'audience.Director', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'writer', 'Simon', 'Barrett', '8220', 'V/H/S/2', '8221', 'pull', 'out', 'variety', 'weapons', 'including', 'crossbow', 'ax', 'machete', 'screwdriver', 'blender', 'nasty', 'home', 'invasion', 'story', 'recall', 'previews', 'family', 'have', 'meal', 'manor', 'woods', 'when', 'one', 'taken', 'out', 'crossbow', 'bolt', 'forehead', 'Much', 'screaming', 'running', 'about', 'only', 'one', 'cluing', 'others', '8220', 'Get', '8221', 'Apparently', 'one', 'there', 'ever', 'seen', 'action-thriller', '8217', 'd', 'know', 'not', 'stand', 'front', 'well-lit', 'windows', 'gang', 'armed', 'masked', 'killers', 'can', 'pick', 'off.Most', 'party', 'down', 'fast', 'handful', 'stick', 'battle', 'attackers', 'white', 'animal', 'masks', 'paired', 'black', 'clothing', 'help', 'provide', 'good', 'jump-scares', 'main', 'protagonist', 'realistically', 'give', 'back', 'cast', 'good', 'character', 'actors', '8211', 'including', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'Nicholas', 'Tucci', 'AJ', 'Bowen', 'Rob', 'Moran', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'Margaret', 'Laney', '8211', 'hold', 'own.Be', 'aware', 'many', 'think', 'movie', '8220', 'horror-comedy.', '8221', 'alone', 'gave', 'shivers', 'Still', 'commentary', 'Wingard', 'Barrett', 'discuss', 'how', 'wanted', 'open', 'movie', 'death', 'small', 'dog', 'baby', 'requisite', 'head', 'left', 'next', 'victim', 'find', 'bloody', 'message', 'pair', 'found', 'concept', 'absolutely', 'hilarious', 'opted', 'something', 'different', '8217', 'grateful', 'film', 'would', '8217', 'been', 'right', 'there', 'also', 'talk', 'how', 'funny', 'was', 'have', 'one', 'victims', 'walk', 'arrow', 'back', '8217', 'kill', 'outright.I', 'must', 'be', 'missing', 'something', 'humor', 'department', 'am', 'still', 'not', 'amused', 'think', 'movie', 'successful', 'horror', 'flick.A', 'second', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Wingard', 'Barrett', 'actors', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'Barbara', 'Compton', 'more', 'serious', 'info', 'such', 'how', 'give', 'good', 'performance', 'horror', 'movie', 'also', 'pertinent', 'info', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'created', 'edited', 'best', 'lot', '8220', 'Ordinary', 'Home', 'Invasion', 'Making', '8216', '8217', 'Next', '8217', '8221', 'shorty', 'interviews', 'cast', 'director', 'writer', 'Barrett', 'saying', 'wrote', 'film', 'cast', 'members', 'mind', 'indicate', 'how', '8220', '8217', 'Next', '8221', 'level', 'standard', 'horror', 'films', '8211', '8217', 'not', 'exactly', 'breakthrough', 'guys', 'Check', 'out', '8220', 'Cabin', 'Woods', '8221', 'example', 'actually', 'manage', 'combine', 'horror', 'comedy.That', '8217', 's', 'how', 'do', 'folks']",You're Next

1631317,AV4645DYR9KUL,B00BEIYNIW,Kyle N.,"[9, 13]","This film, directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett, was originally released at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2011, but only recently became released in theaters in the United States. It's a little surprising it took so long, though, because ""You're Next"" is a tense, well-crafted horror film, one that is very refreshing among a myriad of cliche and annoying slasher films.The film follows the Davison family, who have all gathered for their parents', Paul and Aubrey (Rob Moran and Barbara Crampton), anniversary. Their son Drake and his wife Kelly (Joe Swanberg and Margaret Laney), their son Felix and his girlfriend Zee (Nicholas Tucci and Wendy Glenn), their daughter Aimee and her boyfriend Tariq (Amy Seimetz and Ti West), and lastly their son Crispian and his girlfriend (and heroine) Erin (A.J. Bowen and Sharni Vinson). After all the family gathers, they are suddenly picked off one by one by three assailents wearing animal masks (played by Simon Barrett, Lane Hughes, and L.C. Holt). However, as the family reacts to this sudden disaster, Erin steps up to the plate and works to protect the family.This movie may have a pretty typical set-up (isolated house in the middle of nowhere, dysfunctional group of people who share a close relationship), but it is more than just a typical slasher. It may not reach the heightened levels of horror as a movie such as ""Alien"" (one that contains not only suspense, but has excellent themes and a villain that contains just as much psychological horror as physical horror), but that doesn't belittle the excellent craft of this film. It is a truly suspenseful horror movie, one that contains the right pieces and execution to keep viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the entire film. Subtle moments create suspenseful scenes and the messing with expectations keeps the movie from becoming predictable as well (this movie has some excellent uses of foreshadowing in it's Chekhov's Guns). This also combines with realistic portrayals of characters. Every character in this ensemble cast is believable, mainly because they all have different reactions to the events occurring. Erin knows how to handle the situation and steps up to the plate, making her a worthy addition to the likes of Ellen Ripley and Laurie Strode as a capable (and even sexy) Final Girl, one who the viewers will always root for. However, all of the other characters react differently, often in ways that suit their character well, and each of these different reactions makes sense in context while also balancing out the plot well. All of the characters' decisions, both smart and dumb, help keep them all from being too one-sided. We can't have too much genre savvy (the film would be boring), just as we can't have every character constantly making stupid decisions (we wouldn't care for them if this was the case).The production and direction is also excellent. There are some excellent shots throughout the film. The ""You're Next"" signs are excellently creepy and ominous, Erin gets some shots that definitely emphasize her and her actions, and there are even a few slow-motion moments that aren't used to terrible effect (some of these even help add to the disorientation). The deaths themselves are all unsettling and well-crafted. Some will utterly disturb the viewer, while others will do that while also bringing in just a touch of humor and fun (one particular death at the end caused laughter in the theater). This is definitely not a movie that has lost its gory touch, which a slasher movie never should, really, but it also doesn't build itself solely on gore, either. There's a nice balance between gore and suspense (and even with a sprinkle of humor mixed in). Lastly, the soundtrack is pretty good, providing some great tunes to fit the suspenseful or more action-oriented moods. One particular song used in the last half is catching and fun to listen to, while also complementing the situation Erin is in.Overall, ""You're Next"" is a refreshing and enjoyable slasher film. It may not be one of the best, but it is still great, capturing all the right elements for a slasher movie without straying to the constant cliches of the genre. It is highly recommended to horror movie fans, and especially those who are jaded by many recent efforts.",4,A well-executed and character-driven slasher film.,1378080000,"09 2, 2013",2013,4316,"['film', 'directed', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'written', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'was', 'originally', 'released', 'Toronto', 'International', 'Film', 'Festival', '2011', 'only', 'recently', 'became', 'released', 'theaters', 'United', 'States', 'little', 'surprising', 'took', 'so', 'long', 'though', ""'re"", 'Next', 'tense', 'well-crafted', 'horror', 'film', 'one', 'very', 'refreshing', 'myriad', 'cliche', 'annoying', 'slasher', 'films.The', 'film', 'Davison', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'gathered', 'parents', 'Paul', 'Aubrey', 'Rob', 'Moran', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'anniversary', 'son', 'Drake', 'wife', 'Kelly', 'Joe', 'Swanberg', 'Margaret', 'Laney', 'son', 'Felix', 'girlfriend', 'Zee', 'Nicholas', 'Tucci', 'Wendy', 'Glenn', 'daughter', 'Aimee', 'boyfriend', 'Tariq', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'Ti', 'West', 'lastly', 'son', 'Crispian', 'girlfriend', 'heroine', 'Erin', 'A.J', 'Bowen', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'family', 'gathers', 'are', 'suddenly', 'picked', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'three', 'assailents', 'wearing', 'animal', 'masks', 'played', 'Simon', 'Barrett', 'Lane', 'Hughes', 'L.C', 'Holt', 'However', 'family', 'sudden', 'disaster', 'Erin', 'up', 'plate', 'protect', 'family.This', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'pretty', 'typical', 'set-up', 'isolated', 'house', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'dysfunctional', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'share', 'close', 'relationship', 'more', 'just', 'typical', 'slasher', 'may', 'not', 'reach', 'heightened', 'levels', 'horror', 'movie', 'such', 'Alien', 'one', 'not', 'only', 'suspense', 'excellent', 'themes', 'villain', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'psychological', 'horror', 'physical', 'horror', ""n't"", 'belittle', 'excellent', 'craft', 'film', 'truly', 'suspenseful', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'right', 'pieces', 'execution', 'keep', 'viewers', 'edge', 'seats', 'entire', 'film', 'Subtle', 'moments', 'create', 'suspenseful', 'scenes', 'messing', 'expectations', 'keeps', 'movie', 'becoming', 'predictable', 'as', 'well', 'movie', 'excellent', 'uses', 'foreshadowing', 'Chekhov', 'Guns', 'also', 'realistic', 'portrayals', 'characters', 'character', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'believable', 'mainly', 'have', 'different', 'reactions', 'events', 'occurring', 'Erin', 'how', 'handle', 'situation', 'up', 'plate', 'making', 'worthy', 'addition', 'likes', 'Ellen', 'Ripley', 'Laurie', 'Strode', 'capable', 'even', 'sexy', 'Final', 'Girl', 'one', 'who', 'viewers', 'will', 'always', 'root', 'However', 'other', 'characters', 'react', 'differently', 'often', 'ways', 'suit', 'character', 'well', 'different', 'reactions', 'sense', 'context', 'also', 'balancing', 'out', 'plot', 'well', 'characters', 'decisions', 'smart', 'dumb', 'help', 'keep', 'being', 'too', 'one-sided', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'too', 'much', 'genre', 'savvy', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'character', 'constantly', 'making', 'stupid', 'decisions', 'would', ""n't"", 'care', 'was', 'case', '.The', 'production', 'direction', 'also', 'excellent', 'are', 'excellent', 'shots', 'film', ""'re"", 'Next', 'signs', 'are', 'excellently', 'creepy', 'ominous', 'Erin', 'shots', 'definitely', 'emphasize', 'actions', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'slow-motion', 'moments', 'are', ""n't"", 'used', 'terrible', 'effect', 'even', 'help', 'add', 'disorientation', 'deaths', 'are', 'unsettling', 'well-crafted', 'will', 'utterly', 'disturb', 'viewer', 'others', 'will', 'do', 'while', 'also', 'bringing', 'just', 'touch', 'humor', 'fun', 'one', 'particular', 'death', 'end', 'caused', 'laughter', 'theater', 'definitely', 'not', 'movie', 'lost', 'gory', 'touch', 'slasher', 'movie', 'never', 'should', 'really', 'also', ""n't"", 'build', 'solely', 'gore', 'either', 'nice', 'balance', 'gore', 'suspense', 'even', 'sprinkle', 'humor', 'mixed', 'Lastly', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'good', 'providing', 'great', 'tunes', 'fit', 'suspenseful', 'more', 'action-oriented', 'moods', 'One', 'particular', 'song', 'used', 'last', 'half', 'catching', 'fun', 'listen', 'also', 'complementing', 'situation', 'Erin', 'in.Overall', ""'re"", 'Next', 'refreshing', 'enjoyable', 'slasher', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'still', 'great', 'capturing', 'right', 'elements', 'slasher', 'movie', 'straying', 'constant', 'cliches', 'genre', 'highly', 'recommended', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'especially', 'who', 'are', 'jaded', 'many', 'recent', 'efforts']",You're Next

That does the film a disservice. You're Next has a lot more to offer.Initially, I wanted to compare You're Next to a movie like The Hills Have Eyes, which I think falls more into the Action & Adventure category than its usual description of horror. The Hills Have Eyes is simply a battle story. Like any battle story, you have two sides, they fight, there are casualties on both sides, the end. It&#8217;s simple but done right, amounts to a satisfying thrill ride, an entertaining film, but nothing more.You&#8217;re Next does that formula one better by adding in some mystery. Exactly why is this home invasion happening? Who are these dudes in the masks? In addition to the ever-present hope to see the innocent victims survive, you want to know why they are fighting.Another surprise addition is the humor, and not cheesy slapstick, either, but genuinely clever dialogue relevant to making the people under siege seem like a typical family. The final cliche that gets blasted is the concept of the attractive young lady screaming for help and generally being little more than eye candy. This film pays homage to horror and action, but avoids the cliches.The acting was a bit stilted at times, and the mother of the family looked far too young to be a matriarch.

1631328,A139ZF7CJVVTJU,B00BEIYNIW,"Mark Eremite ""This Is A Display Model Only""","[1, 1]","It's a testament to how much they love me that my friends continue to watch horror movies with me. I'm the only one in my social circle with that die hard compulsion for scary films, which isn't so hard to understand, given the track record for the industry. 90% of the movies I convince my girlfriend or buddies to endure are pretty much a waste of time. The genre is bloated with cliches, rewarmed leftovers, and ripoffs. But I was raised on MST3K and George Romero, and even if a good scary movie is -- indeed -- hard to find, I won't give up. After all, there's something intrinsically invigorating about a really good horror film that makes it, on a visceral and instinctual level, just as powerful (if not more so) than the greatest action or drama. It's like comparing the thrill of bungee jumping with the thrill of reading an amazing book. One of them just taps into that basic human code of survival. I won't go into the psychological merits of either, other than to say that horror movies -- when done right -- resonate with audiences in a way that goes beyond analysis and the cold rigor of logic.My search for a perfect horror movie continues, but YOU'RE NEXT has come the closest in recent years to hitting the mark.The story concerns a wealthy family who have gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the patriarch and his wife. During a tense dinner (the siblings aren't exactly blood brothers ... at first), the group is attacked by a trio of unknown assailants with crossbows. The film becomes a fight of survival, with most of the group getting picked off one by one. All except Erin, the girlfriend of one of the family members, who proves to be far more adept at survival than either the family or the assailants could ever have predicted.The pacing of the movie is perfect, and the tenacious stranger element pumps fresh life into what might otherwise have been a stale home invasion script. There are a few other surprises that keep the movie from seeming too cliched or predictable, and even to the last frame, the flick maintains a grim sense of humor about itself, but without getting too jokey or hammy about it. It is, from start to finish, satisfying in that visceral level that horror films are seeking to appeal to.It's not perfect. The tone is uneven, with both the dialogue and the soundtrack failing to fully embrace whether it wants to be sincere or a parody of itself (listen for the weird 80's synth that stops and starts out of nowhere 2/3rds of the way through the film: I call it &#34;Erin's Theme&#34;). There are also plot holes that the film doesn't try very hard to fill in, including (but not limited to) people splitting up, the turning off of a cell phone jammer, the durability of blenders, the insistent use of vision-crippling masks, and various pulled punches. Similarly, since the cast is so large (at first) a whole lot of characterization gets thrown out of the window with the inclusion of people who become lamely insane when the feces hits the fan (think &#34;tons of screaming about how we're all going to die&#34;). The acting is also second rate (except from Erin), but only rarely to the point of distraction.However, even with these pretty common horror movie flaws, the story keeps itself and the viewers on toes made of pins and needles, and the fact that Erin provides a believable and powerful protagonist for the killers to grind against makes it easy to ignore some of the more glaring flaws in the script. All in all, it tries harder and succeeds more than most of its kin have in recent years, making this a film I would gladly recommend to horror movie fans and the beleaguered friends that put up with them.",4,Not All Horror Films Are Created Equal,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,3679,"['testament', 'how', 'much', 'love', 'friends', 'continue', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', ""'m"", 'only', 'one', 'social', 'circle', 'hard', 'compulsion', 'scary', 'films', ""n't"", 'so', 'hard', 'understand', 'given', 'track', 'record', 'industry', '90', '%', 'movies', 'convince', 'girlfriend', 'buddies', 'endure', 'are', 'pretty', 'much', 'waste', 'time', 'genre', 'bloated', 'cliches', 'rewarmed', 'leftovers', 'ripoffs', 'was', 'raised', 'MST3K', 'George', 'Romero', 'even', 'good', 'scary', 'movie', 'indeed', 'hard', 'find', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'something', 'intrinsically', 'invigorating', 'really', 'good', 'horror', 'film', 'visceral', 'instinctual', 'level', 'just', 'powerful', 'not', 'more', 'so', 'greatest', 'action', 'drama', 'comparing', 'thrill', 'bungee', 'jumping', 'thrill', 'reading', 'amazing', 'book', 'One', 'just', 'taps', 'basic', 'human', 'code', 'survival', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'psychological', 'merits', 'other', 'say', 'horror', 'movies', 'when', 'done', 'right', 'resonate', 'audiences', 'way', 'analysis', 'cold', 'rigor', 'logic.My', 'search', 'perfect', 'horror', 'movie', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'NEXT', 'come', 'closest', 'recent', 'years', 'hitting', 'mark.The', 'story', 'concerns', 'wealthy', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'gathered', 'celebrate', 'anniversary', 'patriarch', 'wife', 'tense', 'dinner', 'siblings', 'are', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'blood', 'brothers', 'first', 'group', 'attacked', 'trio', 'unknown', 'assailants', 'crossbows', 'film', 'fight', 'survival', 'most', 'group', 'getting', 'picked', 'one', 'one', 'Erin', 'girlfriend', 'one', 'family', 'members', 'who', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'adept', 'survival', 'family', 'assailants', 'could', 'ever', 'have', 'predicted.The', 'pacing', 'movie', 'perfect', 'tenacious', 'stranger', 'element', 'pumps', 'fresh', 'life', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'stale', 'home', 'invasion', 'script', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'surprises', 'keep', 'movie', 'seeming', 'too', 'cliched', 'predictable', 'even', 'last', 'frame', 'flick', 'grim', 'sense', 'humor', 'getting', 'too', 'jokey', 'hammy', 'start', 'finish', 'satisfying', 'visceral', 'level', 'horror', 'films', 'are', 'seeking', 'appeal', 'to.It', 'not', 'perfect', 'tone', 'uneven', 'dialogue', 'soundtrack', 'failing', 'fully', 'embrace', 'be', 'sincere', 'parody', 'listen', 'weird', '80', 'synth', 'nowhere', '2/3rds', 'way', 'film', 'call', '34', 'Erin', 'Theme', '34', 'are', 'also', 'plot', 'holes', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'very', 'hard', 'fill', 'including', 'not', 'limited', 'people', 'splitting', 'up', 'turning', 'off', 'cell', 'phone', 'jammer', 'durability', 'blenders', 'insistent', 'use', 'vision-crippling', 'masks', 'various', 'pulled', 'punches', 'Similarly', 'cast', 'so', 'large', 'first', 'whole', 'lot', 'characterization', 'thrown', 'window', 'inclusion', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'lamely', 'insane', 'when', 'feces', 'fan', 'think', '34', 'tons', 'screaming', 'how', ""'re"", 'going', 'die', '34', 'acting', 'also', 'second', 'rate', 'Erin', 'only', 'rarely', 'point', 'distraction.However', 'even', 'pretty', 'common', 'horror', 'movie', 'flaws', 'story', 'viewers', 'toes', 'made', 'pins', 'needles', 'fact', 'Erin', 'believable', 'powerful', 'protagonist', 'killers', 'grind', 'easy', 'ignore', 'more', 'glaring', 'flaws', 'script', 'harder', 'more', 'most', 'kin', 'have', 'recent', 'years', 'making', 'film', 'would', 'gladly', 'recommend', 'horror', 'movie', 'fans', 'beleaguered', 'friends', 'put', 'up']",You're Next
1631329,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B00BEIYNIW,Mark Turner,"[0, 2]","There are a number of movies that come out each year put into the hands of a marketing team that then turn around and make you believe you're watching one type of movie when it's actually another. Confused yet? Okay let's consider this. The horror genre is making major inroads into mass culture. No longer are horror films the once in a blue moon genre but more often they're the main thing playing. So if a movie has horrific elements a marketing team highlights those even if the movie isn't really a horror film at all. Take YOU'RE NEXT for example.The movie opens with a man and woman attacked in a home invasion that really has little to do with the plot other than to establish the villains, a group that wears animal masks and brutally kills the couple. It moves from there to a family reunion of sorts in a secluded, wooded area. First to arrive are mom and dad, both apparently retired and looking forward to the weekend getaway with the now grown kids.First to arrive is Crispian, a teacher and his girlfriend Erin. Not as successful as he had hoped, it becomes a sore point later on with his more successful brother. As the story unfolds you realize that there are many unresolved issues between various family members but that is nothing compared to what they will soon face.The next day the rest of the family arrives in the form of older brother Drake, their sister and younger brother Felix and his new girlfriend. The low level bickering begins and culminates at the dinner table with Drake insulting his sister's new boyfriend. When the boyfriend goes over to the window to look outside glass is shattered, he turns and we see an arrow sticking out of his chest. The movie turns from a family convergence to a home invasion film unlike any other.Unable to cope with the reality of what's going on it is Erin that saves the day and calls out instructions to the rest in an attempt to stave off the attackers. While the invaders might have planned on this family falling apart they had no clue what they would get in Erin. The family is forced to come together on a basic level if they are going to survive this. Traps have been set, some invaders have already been hidden in the house and the only ones armed seem to be the bad guys.So what we're presented with here is more of a thriller, along the lines of something Alfred Hitchcock might have made were he alive today. Even more so as things begin to slowly unspool with each minute of the film and we learn why this is happening and just who is behind it. To say the final revelation is not one most will see coming doesn't do it justice. And now that I've said that don't watch expecting to find clues easily as to that ending. Just know once they start to come, more follow.The movie will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout even though it takes a short time to get going. But then if you don't establish the players here nothing makes sense. Even the early portrayal of Erin as a student aid who seems to be pretty frail is turned upside down along with many other characters in the movie.At first glimpse one could mistake this for the torture porn films that I've come to loathe over the past few years. Be glad that this doesn't fall into that genre at all. Instead it's a white knuckle ride that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the final credits roll. Top notch acting, a solid story, great effects and some smooth camerawork make this film one that will stick in your memory come bed time. What more could you ask for from a thriller?",4,NOT AVON CALLING,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",2014,3540,"['are', 'number', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'year', 'put', 'hands', 'marketing', 'team', 'then', 'turn', 'around', 'make', 'believe', ""'re"", 'watching', 'one', 'type', 'movie', 'when', 'actually', 'Confused', 'yet', 'Okay', 'let', 'consider', 'horror', 'genre', 'making', 'major', 'inroads', 'mass', 'culture', 'No', 'longer', 'are', 'horror', 'films', 'once', 'blue', 'moon', 'genre', 'more', 'often', ""'re"", 'main', 'thing', 'playing', 'So', 'movie', 'horrific', 'elements', 'marketing', 'team', 'highlights', 'even', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'horror', 'film', 'Take', 'YOU', ""'RE"", 'example.The', 'movie', 'man', 'woman', 'attacked', 'home', 'invasion', 'really', 'little', 'do', 'plot', 'other', 'establish', 'villains', 'group', 'animal', 'masks', 'brutally', 'couple', 'family', 'reunion', 'sorts', 'secluded', 'wooded', 'area', 'First', 'arrive', 'are', 'mom', 'dad', 'apparently', 'retired', 'looking', 'forward', 'weekend', 'getaway', 'now', 'grown', 'kids.First', 'arrive', 'Crispian', 'teacher', 'girlfriend', 'Erin', 'Not', 'as', 'successful', 'had', 'hoped', 'sore', 'point', 'later', 'more', 'successful', 'brother', 'story', 'realize', 'are', 'many', 'unresolved', 'issues', 'various', 'family', 'members', 'nothing', 'compared', 'what', 'will', 'soon', 'face.The', 'next', 'day', 'rest', 'family', 'form', 'older', 'brother', 'Drake', 'sister', 'younger', 'brother', 'Felix', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'low', 'level', 'bickering', 'begins', 'culminates', 'dinner', 'table', 'Drake', 'insulting', 'sister', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'When', 'boyfriend', 'window', 'look', 'outside', 'glass', 'shattered', 'see', 'arrow', 'sticking', 'chest', 'movie', 'family', 'convergence', 'home', 'invasion', 'film', 'other.Unable', 'cope', 'reality', 'what', 'going', 'Erin', 'day', 'out', 'instructions', 'rest', 'attempt', 'stave', 'off', 'attackers', 'invaders', 'might', 'have', 'planned', 'family', 'falling', 'apart', 'had', 'clue', 'what', 'would', 'get', 'Erin', 'family', 'forced', 'come', 'together', 'basic', 'level', 'are', 'going', 'survive', 'Traps', 'have', 'been', 'set', 'invaders', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'hidden', 'house', 'only', 'ones', 'armed', 'seem', 'be', 'bad', 'guys.So', 'what', ""'re"", 'presented', 'here', 'more', 'thriller', 'lines', 'something', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'might', 'have', 'made', 'were', 'alive', 'today', 'Even', 'more', 'so', 'things', 'begin', 'slowly', 'unspool', 'minute', 'film', 'learn', 'why', 'happening', 'just', 'who', 'say', 'final', 'revelation', 'not', 'one', 'most', 'will', 'see', 'coming', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice', 'now', ""'ve"", 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'expecting', 'find', 'clues', 'easily', 'ending', 'Just', 'know', 'once', 'start', 'come', 'more', 'follow.The', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat', 'even', 'short', 'time', 'get', 'going', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'establish', 'players', 'here', 'nothing', 'sense', 'Even', 'early', 'portrayal', 'Erin', 'student', 'aid', 'who', 'be', 'pretty', 'frail', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'along', 'many', 'other', 'characters', 'movie.At', 'first', 'one', 'could', 'mistake', 'torture', 'porn', 'films', ""'ve"", 'come', 'loathe', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'Be', 'glad', ""n't"", 'fall', 'genre', 'Instead', 'white', 'knuckle', 'ride', 'grabs', 'throat', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'final', 'credits', 'roll', 'Top', 'notch', 'acting', 'solid', 'story', 'great', 'effects', 'smooth', 'camerawork', 'make', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'stick', 'memory', 'come', 'bed', 'time', 'What', 'more', 'could', 'ask', 'thriller']",You're Next

With YOU&#8217;RE NEXT, director Adam Wingard turns the home-invasion sub-genre on its ear and takes the whole concept in a completely different direction.  The result is a well-made and very satisfying trek into terror.The home-invasion idea is one that truly terrifies me, probably because it actually happens in real life.  Whereas most slasher-flicks are a bit on the unrealistic side, home-invasion films like THE STRANGERS are based on events that can and do make headlines every week.  This context is what makes YOU&#8217;RE NEXT such a horrifying premise.YOU&#8217;RE NEXT is shot well and looks excellent onscreen.  The production value looks high, and it seems no expense was spared to make this film realistic.I am particularly impressed with the special effects.  There&#8217;s plenty of gory fun to go around, and it is all practical; there&#8217;s no CG here!  The Making Of documentary in the Special Features reiterates this a couple of times, and the efforts of the special effects team are well worth it.  The carnage looks great, which only enhances the terror presented onscreen.The acting in YOU&#8217;RE NEXT is very good as well.  Beautiful and talented Australian actress Sharni Vinson heads a stellar cast that also includes screen veteran Rob Moran and horror icon Barbara Crampton.  The actors mesh well and convey a realistic screen presence as a whole.YOU&#8217;RE NEXT is a hell of a horror thriller, and I highly suggest giving it a look.

Most prominent is Joe Swanberg as Drake, one of 4 siblings invited, along with their significant others, to their wealthy parents second home for their 35th wedding anniversary.  Along with Drake and girlfriend Kelly (Margaret Laney) are brothers Crispian (AJ Bowen), a college professor and his former student now girlfriend Erin (Sharni Vinson), and Felix (Nicholas Tucci) and his goth-girl Zee (Wendy Glenn).  There is one sister, Aimee (Amy Seimetz) and boyfriend Tariq (horror filmmaker Ti West).You don't have to wait around long for things to get interesting.  We see a couple neighbors ""down the road"" get wacked for no apparent reason.  Maybe practice.  The home invaders all wear animal masks, for reasons not clear for most of the film.  Family and friends begins to drop one by one with a variety of unusual weapons.  No guns around which is ironic as the father, Paul (Rob Moran) is a retired defense contractor.The emotional reactions seem to be mostly screaming hysterically or in dazed confusion.  Erin, for reasons explained midway through the film, isn't one to sit around and wait to be executed however.  Using some ingrained Australian survival skills and common smarts, she refuses to be a victim.  There are some interesting twists that make this film different from most of its ilk.  Think about all those horror/thriller styled movies where the bad guy is put down, but you just know that one little old bullet or one little blow to the head isn't going to keep him from rising and attacking again.  Erin leaves no question as she turns the tables on the antagonists.If you have time to catch your breath, you will have to ask the question why, and most experience film-goers will figure it out, but that only increases the fun factor.  If the film has a weakness it is that some of the acting is a bit hammy and contrived.  But like all good films of this genre, there is also a goodly dose of dark humor.  In one scene one couple debate the idea of have sex in a bed occupied by the corpse of a close family member.  Hey, I said it was dark humor.  This is an above average horror film.

1631341,A2WZ1B92F81LJJ,B00BEIYNIW,"Olly Buxton ""@electricray""","[0, 0]","If a comedy is a game of rugby, then horror is the dressage phase of a three day equestrian event.There is a rigid formal structure to, er, cleave to, and success or failure is eked out of nuances and minor variations within that sturdy frame. All the more so with the Home Invasion sub-genre, of which form Adam Wingard&#8217;s You&#8217;re Next, which has been in a holding pattern waiting for clearance to land at Lionsgate international for nearly two years, is a superior example.An adult family is convening at a remote and cavernous mansion in rural Missouri to celebrate the wedding anniversary of parents no-one seems to like. The four offspring are Drake (Joe Swanberg), Crispian (AJ Bowen), Felix (Nicholas Tucci) and Aimee (Amy Seimetz). All arrive bearing significant others of a more or less waspish bearing: all but Crispian, that is, whose Erin (Sharni Vinson) is a wide-eyed and wholesome Australian who, at first sight, might have been the girl living next door to the Minogues.Erin discloses that she was a graduate student who shacked up with Crispian while he was her academic supervisor, a scenario which Drake views with evident distaste. Then Aimee&#8217;s boyfriend Tariq (Ti West) discloses that he is an underground film producer. In Drake&#8217;s eye, this is even worse. Father (Rob Moran) creases his cultivated brow ineffectually as bread rolls begin to fly.A few hundred yards away a gang of masked men are about to perpetrate brutal acts on the neighbour Erik (Larry Fessenden) and his sullen teenaged girlfriend Kelly (Margaret Laney). Erik is an unpleasant middle aged man with an earring, and Kelly scowls at him admirably as he completes his manly business. She sticks the Dwight Twilley Band on high rotate as he showers (perhaps still &#8220;looking for the magic&#8221; lacking in his embrace) and is not thereafter around for long enough for the resentment she transparently harbours to make any difference. But then, nor is he.Meanwhile back at the castle, the delicate atmosphere is quickly punctured over dinner by fraternal sniping: Drake nettles Crispian for his underachieving and philandering academic ways, while mother (Barbara Crampton) whimpers neurotically. Felix and his gothic girlfriend Zee (Wendy Glenn) look on malevolently, and we are just beginning to wonder what wholesome Erin mut be making of all this when crossbow bolts start flying through the window. Amusingly, despite this unnerving intrusion the family bickering continues. For all their braggadocio, none of them shows much backbone against the intruders except Erin, who turns out to be far more resourceful than anyone (murderous gang included) expects.Thus proceeds a well directed, thoughtfully edited, well paced horror thriller with a couple of neat and unexpected twists along the way. Wingard has fun with the grand guignol, expertly flexes the tension inherent in the format, and never forgets to leaven what might otherwise have been a grim experience with snippy humour and sharp dialogue. There are a couple of ingenious kills along the way, including one which I rather think counts as a small-scale homage to the lawnmower scene in Peter Jackson&#8217;s Brain Dead.The genre certainly isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s cup of tea: make no mistake there is plenty of gore and a jump-scare on autorotate every five minutes or so (rather like Dwight Tilley&#8217;s Looking for the Magic), but this is an entertaining and well executed film.Olly Buxton",4,Dressage,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3478,"['comedy', 'game', 'rugby', 'then', 'horror', 'dressage', 'phase', 'three', 'day', 'equestrian', 'event.There', 'rigid', 'formal', 'structure', 'er', 'cleave', 'success', 'failure', 'eked', 'nuances', 'minor', 'variations', 'sturdy', 'frame', 'more', 'so', 'Home', 'Invasion', 'sub-genre', 'form', 'Adam', 'Wingard', '8217', '8217', 'Next', 'been', 'holding', 'pattern', 'waiting', 'clearance', 'land', 'Lionsgate', 'international', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'superior', 'example.An', 'adult', 'family', 'convening', 'remote', 'cavernous', 'mansion', 'rural', 'Missouri', 'celebrate', 'wedding', 'anniversary', 'parents', 'no-one', 'like', 'four', 'offspring', 'are', 'Drake', 'Joe', 'Swanberg', 'Crispian', 'AJ', 'Bowen', 'Felix', 'Nicholas', 'Tucci', 'Aimee', 'Amy', 'Seimetz', 'arrive', 'bearing', 'significant', 'others', 'more', 'less', 'waspish', 'bearing', 'Crispian', 'Erin', 'Sharni', 'Vinson', 'wide-eyed', 'wholesome', 'Australian', 'who', 'first', 'sight', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'girl', 'living', 'next', 'door', 'Minogues.Erin', 'was', 'graduate', 'student', 'who', 'shacked', 'up', 'Crispian', 'was', 'academic', 'supervisor', 'scenario', 'Drake', 'views', 'evident', 'distaste', 'Then', 'Aimee', '8217', 'boyfriend', 'Tariq', 'Ti', 'West', 'underground', 'film', 'producer', 'Drake', '8217', 'eye', 'even', 'worse', 'Father', 'Rob', 'Moran', 'cultivated', 'brow', 'ineffectually', 'bread', 'rolls', 'begin', 'fly.A', 'few', 'hundred', 'yards', 'away', 'gang', 'masked', 'men', 'are', 'perpetrate', 'brutal', 'acts', 'neighbour', 'Erik', 'Larry', 'Fessenden', 'sullen', 'teenaged', 'girlfriend', 'Kelly', 'Margaret', 'Laney', 'Erik', 'unpleasant', 'middle', 'aged', 'man', 'earring', 'Kelly', 'scowls', 'admirably', 'manly', 'business', 'Dwight', 'Twilley', 'Band', 'high', 'rotate', 'perhaps', 'still', '8220', 'looking', 'magic', '8221', 'lacking', 'embrace', 'not', 'thereafter', 'long', 'enough', 'resentment', 'transparently', 'make', 'difference', 'then', 'he.Meanwhile', 'back', 'castle', 'delicate', 'atmosphere', 'quickly', 'punctured', 'dinner', 'fraternal', 'sniping', 'Drake', 'nettles', 'Crispian', 'underachieving', 'philandering', 'academic', 'ways', 'mother', 'Barbara', 'Crampton', 'whimpers', 'neurotically', 'Felix', 'gothic', 'girlfriend', 'Zee', 'Wendy', 'Glenn', 'look', 'malevolently', 'are', 'just', 'beginning', 'wonder', 'what', 'wholesome', 'Erin', 'mut', 'be', 'making', 'when', 'crossbow', 'bolts', 'start', 'flying', 'window', 'Amusingly', 'unnerving', 'intrusion', 'family', 'bickering', 'braggadocio', 'none', 'much', 'backbone', 'intruders', 'Erin', 'who', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'resourceful', 'anyone', 'murderous', 'gang', 'included', 'expects.Thus', 'well', 'directed', 'thoughtfully', 'edited', 'well', 'paced', 'horror', 'thriller', 'couple', 'neat', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'way', 'Wingard', 'fun', 'grand', 'guignol', 'expertly', 'tension', 'inherent', 'format', 'never', 'forgets', 'leaven', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'been', 'grim', 'experience', 'snippy', 'humour', 'sharp', 'dialogue', 'are', 'couple', 'ingenious', 'kills', 'way', 'including', 'one', 'rather', 'think', 'counts', 'small-scale', 'homage', 'lawnmower', 'scene', 'Peter', 'Jackson', '8217', 'Brain', 'Dead.The', 'genre', 'certainly', '8217', 'everyone', '8217', 's', 'cup', 'tea', 'make', 'mistake', 'plenty', 'gore', 'jump-scare', 'autorotate', 'five', 'minutes', 'so', 'rather', 'Dwight', 'Tilley', '8217', 'Looking', 'Magic', 'entertaining', 'well', 'executed', 'film.Olly', 'Buxton']",You're Next

1631351,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00BEIYNIW,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[6, 10]","You're Next (Adam Wingard, 2013)I have not been much of a fan of Adam Wingard's recent work. A Horrible Way to Die showed potential but never realized it, and Wingard's contribution to V/H/S (the frame story) was the weakest of the bunch. But I keep giving him chances because his first feature, Home Sick, blew my head off in the best of ways. I know it's a pretty horrible thing to say, but I keep watching Adam Wingard movies because I keep waiting for him to make another Home Sick. And you know what? You're Next, which as I write this has a very surprising 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes (the ""I hate everything horror"" critics haven't weighed in yet, I guess), is almost, but not quite, the movie I have been waiting for Adam Wingard to make for the past six years.Plot: Paul (There's Something About Mary's Rob Moran) and Aubrey (Re-Animator's Barbara Crampton in a very welcome return to horror cinema) are celebrating their thirty-fifth wedding anniversary at the new family vacation home out in the middle of nowhere, and they've invited all of their children out to celebrate--there's Crispin (The House of the Devil's A. J. Bowen) and his girlfriend Erin (Step Up 3D's Sharni Vinson); Drake (V/H/S' Joe Swanberg, who recently stepped behind the camera to direct the highly-touted Drinking Buddies, coming out a couple of weeks after I'm writing this review) and his wife Kelly (Spider Man 3's Margaret Laney, for some reason credited here as Sarah Myers); Felix (Choose's Nicholas Tucci) and his new girlfriend Zee (11-11-11's Wendy Glenn); and the prodigal daughter, Amy (Wristcutters: A Love Story's Amy Seimetz) and her boyfriend Tariq (Ti West, a director in his own right, but appears in front of the camera on occasion, usually in films by either Wingard or Swanberg). All is going about as well as can be expected given that the siblings all pretty much hate one another, but thanks to the opening sequence, we are all too aware that a trio of masked killers (Home Sick's L. C. Holt, A Horrible Way to Die's Simon Barrett--who wrote this script, and who was also responsible for one of the best DTV movies of the past decade, 2004's Deadbirds, and Lane Hughes, who has appeared in every Wingard film since 2007's Pop Skull) are in the woods, watching and waiting for a chance to strike...It sounds tired, and if you go into it expecting yet another home invasion movie (though let's be honest, the bar for those is still pretty high--Funny Games, Ils, The Strangers, etc.), the first thirty minutes of this flick will do nothing to disabuse you of that, though the comedic aspect that made Home Sick such a treat but has been missing from Wingard's work since is back in full force. But things start getting derailed in the best of ways after that, and before long you realize this is not at all the movie you thought you were paying to see. Don't get me wrong, it's still a home invasion movie, but it's as much a comedy as it is a survival thriller; it owes just as much to Peter Jackson as it does to Michael Haneke (especially in one scene that had the sold-out theater in stitches about fifteen minutes from the end of the movie). It's funny, it's perfectly-paced, the acting is fantastic, the soundtrack even better (especially in the last half-hour, when composers Max Heldtberg (Excision), Jasper Justice Lee (a longtime collaborator of Wingard's), and  Kyle McKinnon (The Mountain, the River, and the Road) drop the horror movie ambient-music clich&eacute; and just start paying homage to Goblin, which understandably brought whoops of joy from the audience I saw it with. In other words, it's bloody fantastic, a fun, fun thrill ride I can't recommend highly enough......save one problem, and that one problem is more than enough to balance out a lot of the movie's strong points (though I suspect this will have less of an effect on the small screen). The movie isn't filmed in shakycam, exactly. Let's call it unSteadicam, instead. And to put it mildly, I haven't been this motion-sick in a movie since The Blair Witch Project (and I've seen a lot of shakycam stuff on the big screen; Cloverfield, for example, was not a problem for me at all). I couldn't watch about half of the movie with my eyes open wider than slits for fear of tossing my vastly overpriced popcorn back into its receptacle in a half-digested state. (And oh god, horror directors, can you please stop with the damn blinkies? That repeated-camera-flash scene was an instant headache generator.) If you're planning on going, and despite the awfulness of the filming method, I do suggest you take this one in, because it does have many strong points, take some Dramamine half an hour before showtime. Or wait for it to show up on Netflix or DVD; translation to the small screen may mitigate the motion-sickness effect. So in short, I'm recommending it as enthusiastically as I can given the reservations in this paragraph; those who are weak of stomach (or who suffer inner-ear disorders) will need to avoid it on the big screen, but everyone else should be okay given girded loins and motion-sickness pills. *** ",4,Bunny Games,1376006400,"08 9, 2013",2013,5112,"[""'re"", 'Next', 'Adam', 'Wingard', '2013', 'have',

The preview was the reason for my delay in watching this movie and my suspicions were correct. The story/plot has been used many&#8230;many times on TV and the Big Screen, so there wasn't much left to ones imagination regarding the who's or why's for the home invasion. The story did have a couple of twist that if you are paying attention to you will see coming.It was somewhat nice to see a female as the savior, but as usual she was like the Energizer Bunny or the Terminator. Hollyweird either plays them as weak and helpless or over the top (OTT) super soldiers like in this production. Some of her antics were OTT and made little sense for a fighting for survival mindset and were illogical. The same can be said for male characters in these roles!When everything was going bad there was only one person that I wanted to see survive and it was our heroine the rest were behaving so badly that I wanted to see them meet an untimely end.The movie does have good production values plus the acting is better than most in this genre, but what hurts this movie is the predictable story, the OTT performance by the one girl Seal Team Six member and the direction. The director misses on a few fronts that include a lack of suspense and tension, not noticing how predictable the story is and the total one girl wrecking crew.The movie contains a good amount of violence/blood and some gore with a few partial nude sex scenes. I was surprised that the foul language was kept to a minimum and I think only a few of the F words were used in the entire movie.I will give this 2 stars for the production values and acting, but the totally predictable plot/story and lack of suspense and tension really hurt this movie.",2,"""YOU'RE SO PREDICTABLE AREN'T YOU """,1394668800,"03 13, 2014",2014,1787,"['just', 'finished', 'watching', 'movie', 'taking', 'pass', 'time', 'preview', 'was', 'reason', 'delay', 'watching', 'movie', 'suspicions', 'were', 'correct', 'story/plot', 'been', 'used', 'many', '8230', 'many', 'times', 'TV', 'Big', 'Screen', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'left', 'ones', 'imagination', 'regarding', 'who', 'why', 'home', 'invasion', 'story', 'did', 'have', 'couple', 'twist', 'are', 'paying', 'attention', 'will', 'see', 'coming.It', 'was', 'somewhat', 'nice', 'see', 'female', 'savior', 'usual', 'was', 'Energizer', 'Bunny', 'Terminator', 'Hollyweird', 'weak', 'helpless', 'top', 'OTT', 'super', 'soldiers', 'production', 'antics', 'were', 'OTT', 'made', 'little', 'sense', 'fighting', 'survival', 'mindset', 'were', 'illogical', 'same', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'male', 'characters', 'roles', 'When', 'everything', 'was', 'going', 'bad', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'person', 'wanted', 'see', 'survive', 'was', 'heroine', 'rest', 'were', 'behaving', 'so', 'badly', 'wanted', 'see', 'meet', 'untimely', 'end.The', 'movie', 'have', 'good', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'better', 'most', 'genre', 'what', 'movie', 'predictable', 'story', 'OTT', 'performance', 'one', 'girl', 'Seal', 'Team', 'Six', 'member', 'direction', 'director', 'few', 'fronts', 'include', 'lack', 'suspense', 'tension', 'not', 'noticing', 'how', 'predictable', 'story', 'total', 'one', 'girl', 'wrecking', 'crew.The', 'movie', 'good', 'amount', 'violence/blood', 'gore', 'few', 'partial', 'nude', 'sex', 'scenes', 'was', 'surprised', 'foul', 'language', 'was', 'kept', 'minimum', 'think', 'only', 'few', 'F', 'words', 'were', 'used', 'entire', 'movie.I', 'will', 'give', '2', 'stars', 'production', 'values', 'acting', 'totally', 'predictable', 'plot/story', 'lack', 'suspense', 'tension', 'really', 'hurt', 'movie']",You're Next

1631362,A2I7NGKA8LPN89,B00BEIYNIW,Stacy Hackney (formerly customerS),"[0, 1]","It's strength is it's heroine, nice acting, good transition where she took charge when the mayhem started. The weak point is the parents don't appear rich. The story says the parents are well off, but based on the car they drive, their clothes and lack of bling (in the movies rich people look rich, even when they're dressing down), and the way their second home looks, the fact that the mom prepared dinner for 10 by herself, and the dad didn't look polished (he needed to be in cashmere at the very least, with perhaps a $500 hair cut; his hands needed to be shown so we could see his well-manicured fingers, it would've helped if we'd seen him wearing $5,000 Italian loafers). This couple don't appear to be able to leave their two sons so large a fortune that they'd believably slaughter the majority of their immediate family. If your story says that two adult 30+ something sons are conspiring to kill their parents and siblings for serious money, it'd really help the believability factor if the parents look like they have serious money, like $100 million plus. The parents looked like they were maybe worth $10 to $20 million, including property, at most. In other words, they looked upper middle class, definitely well off, but not slaughter-your-parents-and-siblings wealthy, especially for characters the ages of these perps. Storywise, to murder your family for a piddling $20 million doesn't work unless there are other problems, i.e. the sons are businessmen with businesses on the rocks, or one has a drug problem, maybe the parents are abusive, or the sons were experiencing some sort of other pressure, something, anything, but the story offered nothing. Two of the sons had abit of a snit during dinner, but that seemed like normal squabbling, though they were alittle old for it and their behavior was somewhat discourteous to their parents and their guests.  Also the sons didn't want to commit the atrocious acts, so the parents needed to have big money, and the story needed to give reasons for the sons' actions, for the film to work: as written, story was unbelievable. The acting was mostly fine. Also unbelievable, that anyone would let their only daughter exit the front door while the house was under attack: weak. Filmmakers focused on especially gruesome ways of killing people, so not very interesting there: should've worked harder on having story make sense. Wasn't a total fail, worth watching if you like horror home invasion movies. I didn't know what it was about and had I known probably wouldn't have checked it out from the library, but now that I've seen it, worth watching for the smart lead character. 2 and a half stars.P.S.

It was never intended to be a complete horror movie. However, even after discovering that, while watching I felt so confused. I'm getting straight to the point. It was the worst movie idea I have ever seen. It's lack of good presentation is terrible. This is a movie trying to be something its simply not. Why not even a plot? We as the audience, won't really know what's going on, until near the climax of the movie. There are no &#34;ANIMALS&#34;. They are just people with animal masks, and its hard to tell what the theme of this movie was. This movie is no comedy, and its definitely not a horror movie. I think its a &#34;Let's make money from viewers&#34; movie. I'm so glad this was rented. Now I know, I will not buy this worthless garbage. If its one thing they did okay, was make an attempt at trying to hold you for the kill scenes. That's about it! All the joy ends after the killing. It's not gory at all, but very bloody. It's a money conspiracy story to get the family's wealth.I would say skip on this movie, and see &#34;Stitches&#34; instead. It's actually twice more funnier, and very gory. It has a plot, plus an original horror story.(I apologize for the way I spoke of the movie, but to me and many others, its that bad!

All of Crispian's siblings will be there with their significant others and she'll be meeting his parents for the first time. Everything seems to be going relatively well besides some typical awkward bickering between brothers until they are savagely attacked by masked assailants. The family doesn't know what to do and acts typically panicked and irrational, so Erin unexpectedly takes the lead in showing them how to defend the house and themselves. How will Erin measure up to three armed men?I didn't have high expectations for You're Next because it looked too much like The Strangers and every other home invasion film ever, but I was pleasantly surprised. This clever movie takes those tired tropes and subverts expectation to have surprising twists, a fun plot, and fleshed out, nuanced characters. Let's start with the male characters. Brothers Crispian and Felix are the ones who hired to killers to get the inheritance from their parents. They hate the violence and view the murders as an ordeal to be endured despite having orchestrated the entire thing themselves. The killers aren't relentless killing machines. Quite the opposite. They are three friends who have good tactics and were obviously trained in combat, but they make mistakes and miscalculations. When one of them dies, the others are outraged and allow that emotion to get in the way of the task at hand. Too many films portray these types of characters as indestructible and emotionless Micheal Myerses when they are simply people.Now for the female characters. Erin is the final girl, but she doesn't run around doing stupid things as is typical. She defends herself well, helps the family fortify the house, and isn't afraid to go for the kill in order to survive. Being raised as a survivalist in Australia has its benefits. Zee is Felix's girlfriend who appears aloof and bored with the anniversary party, clearly only there for her boyfriend. After the big reveal, she shows her true colors and her excitement at killing her boyfriend's family. She is there for her own reasons and ceases to try to comfort Felix. Her suggestion to have sex next to Felix's dead mother is flatly rejected, but, coupled with her general attitude, acts to subvert expectations about female behavior, which is usually disgusted and scared by violence and disinterest in sex. Felix's mother Aubrey is more of a stereotypical woman who runs around panicked and does stupid things as a result. However, she sensed something was wrong right when they arrived. Everyone dismissed her as a hysterical woman freaking out for no reason despite the fact that the front door was unlocked and strange sounds were heard in the house. If they had listened to her, a lot more people would be alive. Then when her daughter dies, she takes the time to break down emotionally and mourn her. Too many people in horror films watch loved ones die in front of them and simply go on without a second thought when Aubrey's reaction would be more realistic.In the final scene of the film, Crispian tells Erin that the plan was to kill his family, but leave her as an unbiased witness to guarantee that he and Felix would get the insurance money. He then tells her if she reacted as a woman should, the plan would have been successful. His own concept of women is quite narrow and doesn't take into account the variety of women that exist like Zee and Erin. He not only blames her for the failure of his plan, but basically says she doesn't act like a woman. Crispian reveals himself to be a despicable human being willing to murder his family for money and a misogynist who can't fathom that women exist outside his narrow view of what is feminine.You're Next is a fun film that takes a cliche story line that we've seen a thousand times and makes it interesting by subverting those expectation and giving us more realistic characters. It also doesn't take itself completely seriously and has some genuine moments of humor. My favorite death scene was comically over the top and involved a blender. The acting is spot on all around, especially by Sharni Vinson as Erin.

If this were just another slasher, one could argue &#34;Who cares? I just wanna see cool kills.&#34; Letting a viewer understand a character doesn't need to occur through dialogue (lots of clumsy clunky unrealistic exposition on display here). There can be simple visual clues. There is virtually NOTHING here in the first act which establishes even the most basic groundwork for several radical reveals about several characters' backgrounds and motivations. So, I felt cheated. Which is a shame, b/c the filmmakers CAN construct a powerful, tense siege scene. What made it really frustrating for me was seeing the POTENTIAL for a better story. (for example, one scene where a character reacts SO BELIEVABLY to something unexpected and terrible, and another where a character shudders after killing someone) So much of what's here has been done before and better and I just don't feel the aspects that are quirky and different (praised by some as &#34;genre-defying&#34;) mesh with the rest of the film. One thing I will say in its favor, even if I can't say whether it was intentional, is that the violence perpetrated by &#34;the bad guys&#34; isn't prolonged torture and cruelty. I was surprised by this. For the most part it's just trying to get someone out of the way with one blow or shot. I cite this because one of the protagonists proves (a la the original THE HILLS HAVE EYES) to be incredibly (albeit arguably with reason) cruel and excessive in fighting back. A little irony there. Not enough. Too bad. With better actors and writing for the key roles, this might have &#34;sold&#34; me what it was trying to sell.

Been around the Hollywood &#34;BIZ&#34; all my life and involved with it from the writing, to the making, to the sound, and on and on and I know. When a film like this gets made, it probably had greater written material, but who knows. Sadly, it gets an easy &#34;F&#34; for it's use of already used plot scenarios and on and on. But no one is to blame if they know the Hollywood machinery of making films. Only a few of anything great has ever made it's indelible immortal mark and it will always be that way.Hollywood or The Music Biz or whatever creative situations delivered to any one of us will always try to profit from greatness, but achieve mediocrity or worse at best because of profits as their motive to create. What amuses me is that no matter how much &#34;They&#34; think they can reproduce from a &#34;Hit&#34; film the same quality over and over again from the same dilapidated plot, FX, etc... and make a gigantic profit this way or they can quantify profits with their &#34;Bean Counter&#34; ideas of how to produce films for profit or etc... people still get irate about or bothered because of the result of the usual riffraff that gets made. Most get what's being written here, &#34;They&#34; (Hollywood, etc...) always lose, especially in the end. There are many who probably don't believe this, but history has proven this time and time again.Does mediocrity win? Ya, sure... Every dog has his/her day. But so what. The God Father, etc... is still what most of us want.The miracle of great art whether it be Beethoven or a great Horror &#34;Slasher&#34; movie happens because of elements no one can control, ever! I only wish I could see a great fill every time I rent one, but that's an absurd hope because I know that it'll happen when the time is right, all the elements fuse together by some miracle to make something truly great and that's that. Meanwhile, I pay for a rental here on Amazon never knowing if I'll &#34;hit&#34; something great.

1631377,A3PHT3YPWEA78,B00BEIYNIW,www.horrortrunk.com,"[5, 6]","You're Next is directed by Adam Wingard, who is no stranger to the horror genre after his infamous shorts in both VHS films and The ABC'S of Death. We see a family getaway turn nightmare, when the Davison family become target by three masked killers. However, they did not anticipate one of the guests ready to put up a deadly fight....The invasion of the `happy' home is recurring theme in horror, the originally of this film comes from the unsuspected survival element from one of the guests. The fact that You're Next is not about a paranormal occurrence is pretty much exciting in itself, but the widespread hype for this film and its national cinema release speaks volumes. The film relies heavily on the storyline and script to carry it through, which works to build the anticipation and suspense of each `kill', however a need to overcomplicate by offering an unnecessary explanation leaves this film feeling slightly flat.The gore is plentiful, as it offers a showcase of particularly painful incidents and nasty ways to die. The inclusion of animal masks offers an `old school' horror element; of fear created from the simplest notion of hidden identity by dehumanising of the killers (`Don't bother locking the doors. Animals don't use doors'.)You're Next offers a fun horror that is a descent addition to home invasion. A well put together feature that deserves to have its time in the theatres. With huge similarities to the Korean horror film `To Sir, With Love', there is no great originality to this film, but it does the job in conveying and creating fear, where everyone's safest place in the world becomes a house of horror.Old McDonald had a farm... and on his farm he had some sheep...[...]",3,Horror Trunk: You're Next Review: Beast Feast,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,1710,"[""'re"", 'Next', 'directed', 'Adam', 'Wingard', 'who', 'stranger', 'horror', 'genre', 'infamous', 'shorts', 'VHS', 'films', 'ABC', 'Death', 'see', 'family', 'getaway', 'turn', 'nightmare', 'when', 'Davison', 'family', 'become', 'target', 'three', 'masked', 'killers', 'However', 'did', 'not', 'anticipate', 'one', 'guests', 'ready', 'put', 'up', 'deadly', 'fight', '.The', 'invasion', 'happy', 'home', 'recurring', 'theme', 'horror', 'originally', 'film', 'unsuspected', 'survival', 'element', 'one', 'guests', 'fact', ""'re"", 'Next', 'not', 'paranormal', 'occurrence', 'pretty', 'much', 'exciting', 'widespread', 'hype', 'film', 'national', 'cinema', 'release', 'volumes', 'film', 'heavily', 'storyline', 'script', 'carry', 'build', 'anticipation', 'suspense', 'kill', 'however', 'need', 'overcomplicate', 'offering', 'unnecessary', 'explanation', 'film', 'feeling', 'slightly', 'flat.The', 'gore', 'plentiful', 'showcase', 'particularly', 'painful', 'incidents', 'nasty', 'ways', 'die', 'inclusion', 'animal', 'masks', 'old', 'school', 'horror', 'element', 'fear', 'created', 'simplest', 'notion', 'hidden', 'identity', 'dehumanising', 'killers', 'Do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'locking', 'doors', 'Animals', 'do', ""n't"", 'use', 'doors', ""'re"", 'Next', 'fun', 'horror', 'descent', 'addition', 'home', 'invasion', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'feature', 'have', 'time', 'theatres', 'huge', 'similarities', 'Korean', 'horror', 'film', 'Sir', 'Love', 'great', 'originality', 'film', 'job', 'conveying', 'creating', 'fear', 'where', 'everyone', 'safest', 'place', 'world', 'house', 'horror.Old', 'McDonald', 'had', 'farm', 'farm', 'had', 'sheep', '[', ']']",You're Next
