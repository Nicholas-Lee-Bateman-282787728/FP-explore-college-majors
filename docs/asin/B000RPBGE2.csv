1083533,A29W8EFYRNFCTJ,B000RPBGE2,Brian,"[5, 7]","I see that quite a few people gave this series five stars so why did I rate this with three? Quite frankly, the premise of the show is kind of cool - you're presented with several stories and you have to guess which ones are fact, and which are fiction. Some of the stories are quite good, but there are also quite a few that are pretty lame.The first season features James Brolin as the host - maybe it's just my personal preference, but his acting is pretty stiff and he seems like he's just doing this show until something better comes along - hence, his presence for only a single season.The quality of the filming is lacking as is the acting in most of the stories. It could've been done much, much better - but wasn't - they did this on the cheap, making it almost feel like some sort of 'reality' show to fill a time slot during a writer's strike (perhaps the same people that do American Gladiators did this series).For the filming, acting, and the James Brolin cardboard standup character, I can only give this series (first season) three stars.

1083542,ANAYSRE3LX8GZ,B000RPBGE2,Micheal Hunt,"[0, 3]","Not a bad show here where you are presented with 4 stories in each episode, stories presented in a ""Unsolved Mysteries"" fashion, however the twist is, at the end of the show they reveal which stories where true, and which ones they made up. Presented by James Brolin, you just sit back, watch some short stories in a Tale From the Crypt or Freddy's Nightmares sort of venture and wait for the end results. Need that be repeated again than what I already have?The first few episodes of season 1 where OK, they where believable, but then I suspect the show ran out of factual stories to tell, because they start to claim some stories that did not happen, actually happened. A few episodes towards the end of the season, like a dog coming back from the grave, a kid who comes back to life hours after he is pronounced dead because his sister brought his corpse his favorite teddy bear, or a deceased man emailing a firm to tell them that the woman who is claiming his inheritance is not his niece... those things did NOT happen. Yet, the show is trying to make believers out of people. Sorry, but stories like these would make headlines, Guinness world record entries, have fans devoted to it, or simply have proof and evidence that they had occurred. A few other ghostly stories that they tell about in this show they claim happened too, yet, still, after hundreds of years, there is still no solid proof of any form of life after death. Every video you claim you have watched and beleive it's a ghost, it can be explained factually how someone very much alive and breathing pulled it off, and those who claim they have seen ghosts, get checked out for a mental illness, or accept that you probably worked yourself up so much being afraid, you created it in your mind... or confused reality with dream. Because no matter what you say, no life after death incidence has ever occurred, and why would ghosts be seen wearing clothing? Why would material have an afterlife?This is why I lost interest in the show, because it was claiming stories really had happened and there is no possible way they did, even mysteriously. A mother and daughter where buries together in the same tomb, and the girl goes nuts every night till the mother is removed? OK, so, who was actually around to whiteness the doors shaking? No one was around on the footage, so why would there be any witness? Not to mention, it's pretty obvious which stories they will tell you are true and which are not... most of the true ones are boring and end suddenly with no finale or interesting twist, it's just... oh, this girl speaks to a ghost, or is she clairvoyant and can predict the future? She claims it's her imaginary friend, and her mom tells her to stop talking to them, but she doesn't, she puts it to sleep in her drawer... the end.... WTF? Must be true, because they cut it off so abruptly. Then there is the story of a woman who falls off a tractor, her grandfather in a wheel chair suddenly finds the strength to stand up and run to her aid before the tractor squashes her while she is unconscious. In his last moments his legs work, he stops the tractor and dies on the other side of her where he must have walked to, not fell like shown, and when she wakes up, having not witnessed the incident... she knows he must have gained control of his legs with will power to save her.... of coarse, this story was fiction, and the writers didn't do a great job of hiding it.... In other words, their results are obvious, but no doubt, they are lying about which ones are true. Or REALLY stretching the truth about a simmilar incident that didn't happen quite like the way they have told it. Which is why I lost interest by the end of the 1st season.
