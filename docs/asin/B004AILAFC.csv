1393436,A22DFYZ7D0CYXV,B004AILAFC,"AFRTS Veteran ""CB Franks""","[0, 0]","From his early days as 'Nobody' Terence Hill cast a long shadow in the genre of Spaghetti Westerns. In this latest configuration, Hill mutates to a more mellowed, mature western figure of masculinity; but, just behind those blue eyes there is a sparkle of the whimsical youth measured against the wisdom of years. All bets are on Doc West as he plays out his hand adhering to the same standards he established for himself when he played opposite the monumental talents of Henry Fonda. If you like westerns with as much 'grey matter' as sound effects, blood and guts, you'll be entertained by Doc West... or Triggerman, they obviously released the film under two titles.",5,Doc West or Triggerman is good viewing,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",2014,669,"['early', 'days', ""'Nobody"", 'Terence', 'Hill', 'cast', 'long', 'shadow', 'genre', 'Spaghetti', 'Westerns', 'latest', 'configuration', 'Hill', 'more', 'mellowed', 'mature', 'western', 'figure', 'masculinity', 'just', 'blue', 'eyes', 'sparkle', 'whimsical', 'youth', 'measured', 'wisdom', 'years', 'bets', 'are', 'Doc', 'West', 'out', 'hand', 'adhering', 'same', 'standards', 'established', 'when', 'played', 'opposite', 'monumental', 'talents', 'Henry', 'Fonda', 'like', 'westerns', 'as', 'much', 'matter', 'sound', 'effects', 'blood', 'guts', ""'ll"", 'be', 'entertained', 'Doc', 'West', 'Triggerman', 'obviously', 'released', 'film', 'two', 'titles']",Triggerman

In the sequel to Doc West (not necessary but helpful to watch first), Doc West (Hill) is still in high demand as a doctor.  After half the town gets hurt in a bar fight he realizes its time to open up a hospital.  He turns to the only way he knows in order to make money, a poker tournament.  When an evil Dutchman rides in to town, (to compete and stop West from getting the money he needs) West must decide what is more important, the money or love.

1393448,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B004AILAFC,William Amazzini,"[12, 13]","Terence Hill continues the adventures of 'DOC WEST' in this direct sequel to the original.  The same characters return with the same actors with a surprise appearance by Euro actress Ornella Muti making it seem Hill may be creating a potential series.  It seems our hero is still in the town of Holy Sands and is running out of money to send to his daughter so West's inamorata who is the teacher in town suggests building a hospital.  Naturally, it takes money so it doesn't take long for West and the Sheriff played excellently by Paul Sorvino to set up a major poker tournament so that West, the best poker player in the area, can clean up and win. Naturally, their are bad guys around to put a wrench in the proceedings which makes this outing a bit grittier than the first film.  However, the sentimentality is still there and the credits including the continuation of Maurizio De Angelis's great music score are up to the standards of the original.  If you liked the first one (like I did), you'll love this one.  It's worth it just to see the great Terence Hill looking comedic and lethal in the same shot and bringing honor and loyalty back to the Western genre.
