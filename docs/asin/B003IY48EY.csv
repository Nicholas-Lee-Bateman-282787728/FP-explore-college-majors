1346966,A16Z2OECAUX8Z4,B003IY48EY,Ashley Mott,"[6, 9]","I recently watched the feature film and found it mostly easy to watch, but at times a bit cumbersome in terms of characterization and dialogue repetition.The film largely follows three characters who each establish the roles they will play in potential future movies released as part of the Creation Wars Saga. The Baron is very anti-human and frequently delivers lecture worthy commentary regarding the purity of the Ghen race. ""Purity"" is every third word expelled from the mouth of the Baron. He speaks very loudly. He is mostly annoying. I was glad when he finally shut up somewhat in the last 1/4 of the film.I understand the nature of why he was loud. There is no better way to hammer propaganda home than through a loud, demanding voice that leaves little room for additional thoughts, but after a few scenes I was ready to stage an overthrow of the Baron myself.Aiden Pryme is the younger brother of the Baron. Aiden is an exceedingly handsome yet ready-to-kill Ghen who, wants to join the Ministers, a group of hunters who essentially destroy humans. In this particular film, they are after ""The Channeler."" ""The Channeler"" is a woman who is acting as a vessel for the energy of the Kalendoah. The Kalendoah use her to convert their energy into human words and actions.Throughout much of the film, the Channeler comes across as being possessed by demons, not necessarily energy...that is unless the energy was demonic. That being said, when Kristy Jean Hulslander wasn't ""channeling,"" she did a very good job of acting out her part. She is a lovely woman, and she managed to show, however briefly, the mixed emotion one might feel at having been chosen for a task you are not sure you want.I would like to specify, despite my statements above, that Dark Metropolis is a good movie - a good movie with a few consistent flaws. I'm sure that if two more movies are made, they will improve upon the mostly solid base established by the first and be much better films.I say this with certainty because Dark Metropolis avoids the total cheese and sloppy edit work of many films made with similar budgets, plot lines, and audiences. A good team is obviously working behind the scenes, the actors in place are well-suited to their roles, and the story works - it just needs a slightly different pacing to maintain audience attention completely from beginning to end.Would a watch a sequel to this film? Yes, and for me to watch a sequel the first movie has to be at least moderately compelling. Dark Metropolis is that.Note: My review is based on a screener copy.",4,A Good Film but It Could Have Been a Little Bit Better,1292803200,"12 20, 2010",2010,2564,"['recently', 'watched', 'feature', 'film', 'found', 'mostly', 'easy', 'watch', 'times', 'bit', 'cumbersome', 'terms', 'characterization', 'dialogue', 'repetition.The', 'film', 'largely', 'three', 'characters', 'who', 'establish', 'roles', 'will', 'play', 'potential', 'future', 'movies', 'released', 'part', 'Creation', 'Wars', 'Saga', 'Baron', 'very', 'anti-human', 'frequently', 'delivers', 'lecture', 'worthy', 'commentary', 'regarding', 'purity', 'Ghen', 'race', 'Purity', 'third', 'word', 'expelled', 'mouth', 'Baron', 'very', 'loudly', 'mostly', 'annoying', 'was', 'glad', 'when', 'finally', 'shut', 'up', 'somewhat', 'last', '1/4', 'film.I', 'understand', 'nature', 'why', 'was', 'loud', 'better', 'way', 'hammer', 'propaganda', 'home', 'loud', 'demanding', 'voice', 'little', 'room', 'additional', 'thoughts', 'few', 'scenes', 'was', 'ready', 'stage', 'overthrow', 'Baron', 'myself.Aiden', 'Pryme', 'younger', 'brother', 'Baron', 'Aiden', 'exceedingly', 'handsome', 'yet', 'ready-to-kill', 'Ghen', 'who', 'join', 'Ministers', 'group', 'hunters', 'who', 'essentially', 'destroy', 'humans', 'particular', 'film', 'are', 'Channeler', 'Channeler', 'woman', 'who', 'acting', 'vessel', 'energy', 'Kalendoah', 'Kalendoah', 'use', 'convert', 'energy', 'human', 'words', 'actions.Throughout', 'much', 'film', 'Channeler', 'across', 'being', 'possessed', 'demons', 'not', 'necessarily', 'energy', 'energy', 'was', 'demonic', 'being', 'said', 'when', 'Kristy', 'Jean', 'Hulslander', 'was', ""n't"", 'channeling', 'did', 'very', 'good', 'job', 'acting', 'out', 'part', 'lovely', 'woman', 'managed', 'show', 'however', 'briefly', 'mixed', 'emotion', 'one', 'might', 'feel', 'having', 'been', 'chosen', 'task', 'are', 'not', 'sure', 'want.I', 'would', 'like', 'specify', 'statements', 'Dark', 'Metropolis', 'good', 'movie', 'good', 'movie', 'few', 'consistent', 'flaws', ""'m"", 'sure', 'two', 'more', 'movies', 'are', 'made', 'will', 'improve', 'mostly', 'solid', 'base', 'established', 'first', 'be', 'much', 'better', 'films.I', 'say', 'certainty', 'Dark', 'Metropolis', 'total', 'cheese', 'sloppy', 'edit', 'work', 'many', 'films', 'made', 'similar', 'budgets', 'plot', 'lines', 'audiences', 'good', 'team', 'obviously', 'working', 'scenes', 'actors', 'place', 'are', 'well-suited', 'roles', 'story', 'just', 'slightly', 'different', 'pacing', 'maintain', 'audience', 'attention', 'completely', 'beginning', 'end.Would', 'watch', 'sequel', 'film', 'Yes', 'watch', 'sequel', 'first', 'movie', 'be', 'least', 'moderately', 'compelling', 'Dark', 'Metropolis', 'that.Note', 'review', 'based', 'screener', 'copy']",N/A

This movie is very confusing to me:  So many of the male actors look alike because of their dark clothes and eye makeup and the continuity jumps around a LOT!.  The acting is wooden and stunted.  All in all, very dull.  I won't go into the story much because the other review does.  I do want to add that the ""Channeler"" was NOT much in the story and if there was an ending I sure as heck didn't understand it.
