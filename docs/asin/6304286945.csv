Erland,"[1, 1]","""The Body And The Mind Do Not Always Travel Together"" ~  Part 3""Kickboxer 3: The Art Of War"" takes a surprisingly different approach from the expected and spends the larger portion of the film exploring the kinder, gentler, more philosophical side of Sasha Mitchell in the starring role of American kickboxer David Sloan. Touched by the plight of Brazilian poverty and the sight of a young boy and his teenage sister living on the streets David and his friend and trainer take them under his wing and devise a plan to alter their destines for the better. When the girl is kidnapped by a prostitution/slavery ring David makes it his business to rescue her.Yes, there is some kickboxing in the film. It just so happens that the man behind the abduction is also the owner of the vicious kickboxer David is scheduled to fight in defense of his title. Winner gets the girl.Short on fighting but Sasha Mitchell's easy going demeanor makes for an enjoyable viewing. In case you need more to keep you watching take a long look at Alethea Miranda in the role of the kidnapped Isabella. That should hold your attention until the end.""The Most Dangerous Weapon In The Universe Is A Focused Mind"" ~ Part 4""Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor"" marks the return of Tong Po. David's task is to sneak into Tong Po's private kickboxing tournament in Mexico, free his kidnapped wife and bring an end to Po's nefarious drug dealing. You know what happens.This poor man's version of Bruce Lee's `Enter the Dragon"" is a good watch overall with lots of fighting and a pretty girl or two to spice things up.

It is as different from the first 3 as night is from day. This installment is very dark in tone, having jettisoned the Teacher figure from previous films, and the humor that interaction with him provided. Our hero is now a loner out for revenge upon his nemesis Tong Po. In the first few expository minutes, a voice-over explains that David(I think that's his name) has married, and his wife was kidnapped and is being held by Tong Po. The rest of the story involves a to-the-death competion hosted by T. P. which our hero infiltrates in order to find and free his wife.This movie would have made a much better stand-alone picture. Mitchell's character has changed so much he might as well be a different man, although it would not have solved the problem of the tacked-on backstory. Besides, a different actor is playing Tong Po! Sure he looks similar, but that is really pushing it!Sasha Mitchell does well in the fight scenes, showing some grace and variety in his movement. The camera manages to shoot him so you can even see some of what he is doing. Several time Women's Champion Michelle Krasnoo also appears as a bratty girl who wants to fight with the big boys. Her martial arts are much better than her acting. You almost want her to get her butt kicked.There is not much depth in the story but not much is required. The wounded hero has a just cause, the villain does dastardly deeds with a smile and there are many round-knees and devastating kicks. This movie really just wants to look good and it manages pretty well. There is eye candy for men and women and lots of martial arts.This is not bad for b-movie fight flicks. The director left room for a sequel should the studio want to try for one more but 4 is enough already!

412174,A38UHOCEKSUOSP,6304286945,"dominion_ruler ""Bryan""","[6, 6]","KICKBOXER 33 STARS -  DISAPPOINTINGLY NO TONG POKickboxer 3 goes away from the first two movies with the absenece of the impressive villain, Tong Po.  David Sloan and Xian return though, and fly to Brazil where David is to fight the Argentina fighter, Eric Martine, for the lightweight world kickboxing championship.  While in Brazil, David and Xian meet and become friends to a homeless boy and his older sister.  David also meets Eric Martine's promoter, Frank Lane, who is inviting to David and Xian but secretly steals the boy's older sister to sell into prostitution.  Lane captures David and puts him through excrutiating training, hoping David will be too weak for the fight against Martine.The story in Kickboxer 3 is pretty decent, but its harder to appreciate it with the absence of Tong Po.  There aren't many fights in the movie, and only two that are decent. The first is an exhibition match between Martine and another fighter.  The best fight in the movie is between David and Martine.  Its about a 5 minute fight that begins in the ring but ends on the arena floor with the surrounding crowd cheering on.  I really like this fight and I wished it were longer (especially when they fight outside the ring on the floor).  Also worth mentioning, there is a small scene of Caporeia fighters in the beginning of the movie that is beautiful to watch.Kickboxer 3 overall turns out to be nothing more than an average martial arts flick.  After Kickboxer 5, it is the worst in the franchise.  Its not a bad movie, but Kickboxer 1, 2, and 4 have a lot more to offer, especially action and fighting.KICKBOXER 44 STARS - TONG PO RETURNSMany people would love to give this movie far less than four stars, but Kickboxer 4 really is better than a lot of American martial art movies.  No, its not a classic like the first 2 kickboxers or bloodsport, and its not as intense on fighting as Shootfighter or Best of the Best 2.  But overall, Kickboxer 4 delivers (as a good B-rated movie in the genre of American martial arts).  The action is a plenty, there is a tournament, good-looking locales, and acting that isn't terrible along with a story that has a decent plot.Sasha Mitchell is the only returning star from any of the 1st 3 Kickboxers.  Still playing the lead role of David Sloan, this time out the character is a lot darker and far-less laid back than in the previous 2 films (probably because his wife has been kidnapped and he has been framed for murder in the beginning of the movie).  Although many would disgree with the turnaround of his character, it sets Kickboxer 4 up for a lot more fights.  Tong Po returns, but instead of being played by Michel Qissi, Kamel Krifia takes over.  Unfortunately, his fake make-up and higher voice doesn't set quite a villainous tone for Po, as compared to the 1st 2 Kickboxers.  But, there is still something about him that still makes the villain role convincing enough.Kickboxer 4 has a lot of fighitng, both in and out of the tournament.  There is a bar fight near the beginning of the movie where Sloan kicks everyone butt and doesn't get hit once.  The tournament has plenty of fights, though most are short and unimpressive.  There is one fighter that does some Caporeia, which I think is always great to watch.  Tong Po fights very little, only near the end of the movie against David Sloan.  The fight is good, with Po and Sloan fighitng it out outside on table tops covered with dishes and glasses for about 2 minutes, but it could have been so much cooler if Tong Po connected with maybe one hit.  Unfortunately, its Sloan all the way from the beginning of the fight.Kickboxer 4 has its flaws, but if the flaws were corrected it may very well have been a 5 star rating by me.  The movie is still entertaining from start to finish.  The movie ends with a hopefull return of Tong Po, but Kickboxer 5 blew the pants off of that one.",4,"not as good as the first Kickboxers, but good price for 2 films on one dvd",1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,3889,"['KICKBOXER', '33', 'STARS', 'NO', 'TONG', 'POKickboxer', '3', 'away', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'absenece', 'impressive', 'villain', 'Tong', 'Po', 'David', 'Sloan', 'Xian', 'return', 'fly', 'Brazil', 'where', 'David', 'fight', 'Argentina', 'fighter', 'Eric', 'Martine', 'lightweight', 'world', 'kickboxing', 'championship', 'Brazil', 'David', 'Xian', 'meet', 'become', 'friends', 'homeless', 'boy', 'older', 'sister', 'David', 'also', 'Eric', 'Martine', 'promoter', 'Frank', 'Lane', 'who', 'inviting', 'David', 'Xian', 'secretly', 'boy', 'older', 'sister', 'sell', 'prostitution', 'Lane', 'David', 'excrutiating', 'training', 'hoping', 'David', 'will', 'be', 'too', 'weak', 'fight', 'Martine.The', 'story', 'Kickboxer', '3', 'pretty', 'decent', 'harder', 'appreciate', 'absence', 'Tong', 'Po', 'are', ""n't"", 'many', 'fights', 'movie', 'only', 'two', 'are', 'decent', 'first', 'exhibition', 'match', 'Martine', 'fighter', 'best', 'fight', 'movie', 'David', 'Martine', '5', 'minute', 'fight', 'ring', 'arena', 'floor', 'surrounding', 'crowd', 'cheering', 'really', 'fight', 'wished', 'were', 'longer', 'especially', 'when', 'fight', 'ring', 'floor', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'small', 'scene', 'Caporeia', 'fighters', 'beginning', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'watch.Kickboxer', '3', 'overall', 'out', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'average', 'martial', 'arts', 'flick', 'Kickboxer', '5', 'worst', 'franchise', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'Kickboxer', '1', '2', '4', 'have', 'lot', 'more', 'offer', 'especially', 'action', '44', 'STARS', 'TONG', 'PO', 'RETURNSMany', 'people', 'would', 'love', 'give', 'movie', 'far', 'less', 'four', 'stars', 'Kickboxer', '4', 'really', 'better', 'lot', 'American', 'martial', 'art', 'movies', 'No', 'not', 'classic', 'first', '2', 'kickboxers', 'bloodsport', 'not', 'intense', 'fighting', 'Shootfighter', 'Best', 'Best', '2', 'overall', 'Kickboxer', '4', 'delivers', 'good', 'B-rated', 'movie', 'genre', 'American', 'martial', 'arts', 'action', 'plenty', 'tournament', 'good-looking', 'locales', 'acting', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'along', 'story', 'decent', 'plot.Sasha', 'Mitchell', 'only', 'returning', 'star', '1st', '3', 'Kickboxers', 'Still', 'playing', 'lead', 'role', 'David', 'Sloan', 'time', 'out', 'character', 'lot', 'darker', 'far-less', 'laid', 'back', 'previous', '2', 'films', 'probably', 'wife', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'been', 'framed', 'murder', 'beginning', 'movie', 'many', 'would', 'disgree', 'turnaround', 'character', 'Kickboxer', '4', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'fights', 'Tong', 'Po', 'returns', 'instead', 'being', 'played', 'Michel', 'Qissi', 'Kamel', 'Krifia', 'over', 'Unfortunately', 'fake', 'make-up', 'higher', 'voice', ""n't"", 'set', 'quite', 'villainous', 'tone', 'Po', 'compared', '1st', '2', 'Kickboxers', 'still', 'something', 'still', 'villain', 'role', 'convincing', 'enough.Kickboxer', '4', 'lot', 'fighitng', 'tournament', 'bar', 'fight', 'beginning', 'movie', 'where', 'Sloan', 'everyone', 'butt', ""n't"", 'get', 'hit', 'once', 'tournament', 'plenty', 'fights', 'most', 'are', 'short', 'unimpressive', 'one', 'fighter', 'Caporeia', 'think', 'always', 'great', 'watch', 'Tong', 'Po', 'fights', 'very', 'little', 'only', 'end', 'movie', 'David', 'Sloan', 'fight', 'good', 'Po', 'Sloan', 'fighitng', 'out', 'table', 'tops', 'covered', 'dishes', 'glasses', '2', 'minutes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'cooler', 'Tong', 'Po', 'connected', 'maybe', 'one', 'hit', 'Unfortunately', 'Sloan', 'way', 'beginning', 'fight.Kickboxer', '4', 'flaws', 'flaws', 'were', 'corrected', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'have', 'been', '5', 'star', 'rating', 'movie', 'still', 'entertaining', 'start', 'finish', 'movie', 'hopefull', 'return', 'Tong', 'Po', 'Kickboxer', '5', 'blew', 'pants', 'one']",Kickboxer 4 VHS

However, after the sheer disappointment that wasKickboxer 3: The Art of War, I see fit to cut this one some slack for just being a carefree karate B-movie. It has some disappointing parts that nearly earn it a lower rating, but considering that you ought to watch a film like this in a none-too-serious mindset to begin with, I can't complain too much.The story: when he is framed, sent to prison, and his wife is kidnapped by a returning Tong Po (Kamel Kriffa,Thunder in Paradise 3), the happy-go-lucky David Sloan (Sasha Mitchell,Step by Step) transforms into a dark soul, hell-bent on revenge. He's released by the DEA to infiltrate a tournament set up by the fighter-turned-kingpin to bring him to justice - a task he must accomplish alongside rescuing his wife and keeping Po from discovering his identity.Though not completely humorless, you realize early on that this film isn't going to be quite as (intentionally) silly in temperament as its predecessors. Sloan is presented as more of a Charles Bronson-type character than his usual goofy self, and this actually aids his acting performance, which is easily the best of the three movies he's done for this series. The film's dramatic offerings in general are decent, but few things can redeem the decision to have Kamel Kriffa take over the role of lead villain from his cohort Michel Qissi. It's less of a performance qualm than a technical one: apparently the only way to make Kriffa look Oriental was to fit him with heavy makeup and a prosthetic brow, the result of which looks not the least bit convincing. In hindsight, this shouldn't make too much of a difference since the regal, instrument-playing, evil-laughing Tong Po of ""The Aggressor"" is so different from the near-stoic beast that menaced the first two movies that they may as well be two different characters. It's admirable that the filmmakers wanted to tie this movie closer to the original films than the third one, but it really would've been better if they had just delivered a new villain and not attempted to substitute one of the more notable bad guys of martial arts cinema.The movie's fight content is highlighted early on by a thoroughly entertaining bar brawl Sasha Mitchell has to save 20-year-old Michele Krasnoo (Death Match): playing out more like a Steven Seagal beatdown than a Van Damme karate fight, it's no technical masterpiece but nevertheless undeniably fun to watch. All the fighting that follows it, however, must be taken with a couple grains of salt. The tournament itself doesn't begin until the last 35 minutes of the film, and though it features capoeira mestre Amen Santo (Only the Strong) and two of the legendary Machado brothers, sixteen of the twenty fights last under fifteen seconds, with some not even exceeding ten. There are some neat moves to be seen, but it's hard to appreciate them in such short bursts. The eventual showdown between David and Tong Po is an absolute joke, with less karate than there is rolling around on tables and having Po be absolutely destroyed by Sloan from start to stop - a definite step down from the characters' encounter in the second film. What's more (SPOILER), the movie offers next to no resolution by having Tong Po simply run away from the fight and not be seen again for the movie's remaining sixty seconds.The film's first half is definitely the more balanced and consistent, but even the disappointments offered by the last 45 minutes can't drag it down completely. In a way, my three-star rating is honorary, considering that director Albert Pyun was unable to even match the overall competence of his ownKickboxer 2, but in light of Sasha Mitchell leaving the series to make room for Mark Dacascos in the not-really-any-betterKickboxer 5: Redemption, it's nice to know that at least he didn't have to bow out at the end of one of the worse entries of the series.",3,"""I thought you wanted to . . . regain your honor.""",1300060800,"03 14, 2011",2011,4059,"['fourth', 'installment', 'Kickboxer', 'franchise', ""n't"", 'great', 'movie', 'means', 'especially', 'when', 'compared', 'original', 'Van', 'Damme', 'classic', 'better-than-average', 'first', 'sequel', 'However', 'sheer', 'disappointment', '3', 'Art', 'War', 'see', 'fit', 'cut', 'one', 'slack', 'just', 'being', 'carefree', 'karate', 'B-movie', 'disappointing', 'parts', 'nearly', 'earn', 'lower', 'rating', 'considering', 'ought', 'watch', 'film', 'none-too-serious', 'mindset', 'begin', 'ca', ""n't"", 'complain', 'too', 'much.The', 'story', 'when', 'framed', 'sent', 'prison', 'wife', 'kidnapped', 'returning', 'Tong', 'Po', 'Kamel', 'Kriffa', 'Thunder', 'Paradise', '3', 'happy-go-lucky', 'David', 'Sloan', 'Sasha', 'Mitchell', 'Step', 'Step', 'dark', 'soul', 'hell-bent', 'revenge', 'released', 'DEA', 'infiltrate', 'tournament', 'set', 'up', 'fighter-turned-kingpin', 'bring', 'justice', 'task', 'must', 'accomplish', 'rescuing', 'wife', 'keeping', 'Po', 'discovering', 'identity.Though', 'not', 'completely', 'humorless', 'realize', 'early', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'quite', 'intentionally', 'silly', 'temperament', 'predecessors', 'Sloan', 'presented', 'more', 'Charles', 'Bronson-type', 'character', 'usual', 'goofy', 'self', 'actually', 'acting', 'performance', 'easily', 'best', 'three', 'movies', 'done', 'series', 'film', 'dramatic', 'offerings', 'general', 'are', 'decent', 'few', 'things', 'can', 'redeem', 'decision', 'have', 'Kamel', 'Kriffa', 'take', 'over', 'role', 'lead', 'villain', 'cohort', 'Michel', 'Qissi', 'less', 'performance', 'qualm', 'technical', 'one', 'apparently', 'only', 'way', 'make', 'Kriffa', 'look', 'Oriental', 'was', 'fit', 'heavy', 'makeup', 'prosthetic', 'brow', 'result', 'not', 'least', 'bit', 'convincing', 'hindsight', 'should', ""n't"", 'make', 'too', 'much', 'difference', 'regal', 'instrument-playing', 'evil-laughing', 'Tong', 'Po', 'Aggressor', 'so', 'different', 'near-stoic', 'beast', 'menaced', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'two', 'different', 'characters', 'admirable', 'filmmakers', 'wanted', 'tie', 'movie', 'closer', 'original', 'films', 'third', 'one', 'really', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'delivered', 'new', 'villain', 'not', 'attempted', 'substitute', 'one', 'more', 'notable', 'bad', 'guys', 'martial', 'arts', 'cinema.The', 'movie', 'fight', 'content', 'highlighted', 'early', 'thoroughly', 'entertaining', 'bar', 'brawl', 'Sasha', 'Mitchell', 'save', '20-year-old', 'Michele', 'Krasnoo', 'Death', 'Match', 'playing', 'out', 'more', 'Steven', 'Seagal', 'beatdown', 'Van', 'Damme', 'karate', 'fight', 'technical', 'masterpiece', 'nevertheless', 'undeniably', 'fun', 'watch', 'fighting', 'however', 'must', 'be', 'taken', 'couple', 'grains', 'salt', 'tournament', ""n't"", 'begin', 'last', '35', 'minutes', 'film', 'capoeira', 'mestre', 'Amen', 'Santo', 'Only', 'Strong', 'two', 'legendary', 'Machado', 'brothers', 'sixteen', 'twenty', 'fights', 'last', 'fifteen', 'seconds', 'not', 'even', 'exceeding', 'ten', 'are', 'neat', 'moves', 'be', 'seen', 'hard', 'appreciate', 'such', 'short', 'bursts', 'eventual', 'showdown', 'David', 'Tong', 'Po', 'absolute', 'joke', 'less', 'karate', 'rolling', 'around', 'tables', 'having', 'Po', 'be', 'absolutely', 'destroyed', 'Sloan', 'start', 'stop', 'definite', 'step', 'down', 'characters', 'encounter', 'second', 'film', 'What', 'more', 'SPOILER', 'movie', 'next', 'resolution', 'having', 'Tong', 'Po', 'simply', 'run', 'away', 'fight', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'movie', 'remaining', 'sixty', 'seconds.The', 'film', 'first', 'half', 'definitely', 'more', 'balanced', 'consistent', 'even', 'disappointments', 'offered', 'last', '45', 'minutes', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drag', 'down', 'completely', 'way', 'three-star', 'rating', 'honorary', 'considering', 'director', 'Albert', 'Pyun', 'was', 'unable', 'even', 'match', 'overall', 'competence', 'ownKickboxer', '2', 'light', 'Sasha', 'Mitchell', 'leaving', 'series', 'make', 'room', 'Mark', 'Dacascos', 'not-really-any-betterKickboxer', '5', 'Redemption', 'nice', 'know', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bow', 'out', 'end', 'one', 'worse', 'entries', 'series']",Kickboxer 4 VHS

You get the impression that they are actually going to have a tournament in this one and they almost give you double digits in fights.Since this was almost watchable, I will go over the strong points:Hot girl who can fight, always a good thing.Cody getting to show off a little bit and he actually looks decent in this one.Having a tournament and actually showing some fights, none that are good, but some that I would give a 2/5.Even hotter girl-this one even gets down.Horrible things about this movie:Guy who looks like the abd guy from original kickboxer is really hard to look at.  If you are gonna get a look-a-like, at least get a fighter, and maybe he can fight, but if he can, let him.  So something was very wrong there, and almost as bad as that was his make up.  They used a very tan person so when he took off his shirt, his face looked white in comparison to his golden skin.  Very hard to watch.Guy who is a b movie actor and can fight, but acting ability can be rivaled by any male soap opera star.Bad guy doesn't notice cody is in the tournament until the end.  This part aspect is so bad that it is funny.  Every time cody would fight, something would distract him from seeing cody's face like his girl being kissed, truly funny stuff.So final fight ranks #384,225th on my all-time list, pretty good.",2,Just watched 3 and 4 and this one was not as bad as the former,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,1393,"['Now', 'movie', 'actually', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'good', 'last', 'one', 'get', 'impression', 'are', 'actually', 'going', 'have', 'tournament', 'one', 'almost', 'give', 'double', 'digits', 'fights.Since', 'was', 'almost', 'watchable', 'will', 'go', 'strong', 'points', 'Hot', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'fight', 'always', 'good', 'thing.Cody', 'getting', 'show', 'off', 'little', 'bit', 'actually', 'decent', 'one.Having', 'tournament', 'actually', 'showing', 'fights', 'none', 'are', 'good', 'would', 'give', '2/5.Even', 'hotter', 'girl-this', 'one', 'even', 'down.Horrible', 'things', 'movie', 'Guy', 'who', 'abd', 'guy', 'original', 'kickboxer', 'really', 'hard', 'look', 'are', 'gon', 'get', 'look-a-like', 'least', 'get', 'fighter', 'maybe', 'can', 'fight', 'can', 'let', 'something', 'was', 'very', 'wrong', 'there', 'almost', 'as', 'bad', 'was', 'make', 'up', 'used', 'very', 'tan', 'person', 'so', 'when', 'took', 'off', 'shirt', 'face', 'looked', 'white', 'comparison', 'golden', 'skin', 'Very', 'hard', 'watch.Guy', 'who', 'b', 'movie', 'actor', 'can', 'fight', 'acting', 'ability', 'can', 'be', 'rivaled', 'male', 'soap', 'opera', 'star.Bad', 'guy', ""n't"", 'notice', 'cody', 'tournament', 'end', 'part', 'aspect', 'so', 'bad', 'funny', 'time', 'cody', 'would', 'fight', 'something', 'would', 'distract', 'seeing', 'cody', 'face', 'girl', 'being', 'kissed', 'truly', 'funny', 'stuff.So', 'final', 'fight', 'ranks', '384,225th', 'all-time', 'list', 'pretty', 'good']",Kickboxer 4 VHS
412181,A3UA046AA3DXFD,6304286945,Sid the Elf,"[0, 0]","After a beautiful B journey in Kickboxer 3 we simply hand an urging for another dose of David Sloan. His ultimate dude antics backed up by neck snapping fury provided a performance for the ages. However in Kickboxer 4 the Dude has disappeared! We are introduced to a very dark, angry side that quite honestly caught us with the front. We were expecting some light hearted B martial arts. Instead we were given a soul searching mission of revenge. In addition to this surprise was the unofficial return of the villainous Tong Po from the first and second installment. However this was no Tong Po, but a very sad excuse of a wax figure look a like. It appears they rounded up some Asian fellow, slapped on a gang of make up with fake bald head, the trademark ponytail, and sent him out on the set to be completely bizarre looking. In fact in a couple scenes you can see his fake bald head start wrinkling up as if it was going to pop off. That would have been a 5 start event if that took place. None the less we were far from let down as we always love a poorly executed surprise.Kickboxer 4 opens with a ten minute, time killing, recap of the first two films to try and make you forget the third even exists. We now see David Sloan spending his life locked up in a jail cell after being framed for murder. We love the Lock Up style feel going on here. If things aren't bad enough he finds out his arch enemy Tong Po has taken his wife captive to his crime fortress. All of a sudden Tong Po is some big shot drug lord in Mexico, naturally no explanation for this, where he's holding a private fighting tournament. The DEA wants to bring Po down and can only thing of one source to complete this mission....David Sloan aka Cody Lambert. Seems the DEA's force of trained professionals couldn't match the wits of a B grade action star. So Sloan gets released and makes his way to the compound. On the way he stops by a local biker bar and gets into one of the most hilarious fights ever. He clears out an entire bar where 5 different guys go through windows. One guy gets thrown through a window, then hit by a car which then launches him back in through another window. Pure B genius. Once he makes it to the compound he's met by a team of machismo security guards who are all wearing the fruitiest neon colored shirts. In the end countless poorly executed fight scenes are doled out with Cody exacting his revenge. He beats Tong down so bad that he actually runs away in fear, then throws a steak knife through another bad guy holding his wife captive. Naturally he saves his wife and the film just ends in a very matter of fact nature.To be honest Kickboxer 4 was a bit of a let down with the overly serious vibe going on. Despite it's depressing undertone we absolutely loved the drawn out fight scenes with the Bar scene leading the back. Plus in a fight early on, David fights a guy that actually may have been Don Mattingly which sent the DMF through the roof. He beat him down so hard we thought his mustache was going to pop off. In addition to the great fighting was a very solid rack report that would have made a young Sid very happy. Just the sheer B factor of the fake Tong Po was enough to ear this film a four star rating. The guy is so weird looking that you can't take your eyes off him. You'll be rooting non stop for that fake bald head to pop off, but unfortunately will not get that satisfaction. One reviewer said the credits said Van Damme played Tong Po in this one. Now if that's the case then the film would have to be awarded a 5 start rating. That would mean Van Damme was so embarrassed to be part of the film that he was completely made up as a different character to avoid the recognition. Now that would be beautiful.",4,Tong Po returns...as a wax figure version of himself,1341532800,"07 6, 2012",2012,3746,"['beautiful', 'B', 'journey', 'Kickboxer', '3', 'simply', 'hand', 'urging', 'dose', 'David', 'Sloan', 'ultimate', 'dude', 'antics', 'backed', 'up', 'neck', 'snapping', 'fury', 'provided', 'performance', 'ages', 'However', 'Kickboxer', '4', 'Dude', 'disappeared', 'are', 'introduced', 'very', 'dark', 'angry', 'side', 'quite', 'honestly', 'caught', 'front', 'were', 'expecting', 'light', 'hearted', 'B', 'martial', 'arts', 'Instead', 'were', 'given', 'soul', 'searching', 'mission', 'revenge', 'addition', 'surprise', 'was', 'unofficial', 'return', 'villainous', 'Tong', 'Po', 'first', 'second', 'installment', 'However', 'was', 'Tong', 'Po', 'very', 'sad', 'excuse', 'wax', 'figure', 'look', 'like', 'rounded', 'up', 'Asian', 'fellow', 'slapped', 'gang', 'make', 'up', 'fake', 'bald', 'head', 'trademark', 'ponytail', 'sent', 'out', 'set', 'be', 'completely', 'bizarre', 'looking', 'fact', 'couple', 'scenes', 'can', 'see', 'fake', 'bald', 'head', 'start', 'wrinkling', 'up', 'was', 'going', 'pop', 'off', 'would', 'have', 'been', '5', 'start', 'event', 'took', 'place', 'None', 'less', 'were', 'far', 'let', 'down', 'always', 'love', 'poorly', 'executed', 'surprise.Kickboxer', '4', 'ten', 'minute', 'time', 'killing', 'recap', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'try', 'make', 'forget', 'third', 'even', 'now', 'see', 'David', 'Sloan', 'spending', 'life', 'locked', 'up', 'jail', 'cell', 'being', 'framed', 'murder', 'love', 'Lock', 'Up', 'style', 'feel', 'going', 'here', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'bad', 'enough', 'out', 'arch', 'enemy', 'Tong', 'Po', 'taken', 'wife', 'captive', 'crime', 'fortress', 'sudden', 'Tong', 'Po', 'big', 'shot', 'drug', 'lord', 'Mexico', 'naturally', 'explanation', 'where', 'holding', 'private', 'fighting', 'tournament', 'DEA', 'bring', 'Po', 'down', 'can', 'only', 'thing', 'one', 'source', 'complete', 'mission', '.David', 'Sloan', 'aka', 'Cody', 'Lambert', 'DEA', 'force', 'trained', 'professionals', 'could', ""n't"", 'match', 'wits', 'B', 'grade', 'action', 'star', 'So', 'Sloan', 'released', 'way', 'compound', 'way', 'local', 'biker', 'bar', 'one', 'most', 'hilarious', 'fights', 'ever', 'out', 'entire', 'bar', 'where', '5', 'different', 'guys', 'go', 'windows', 'One', 'guy', 'thrown', 'window', 'then', 'hit', 'car', 'then', 'back', 'window', 'Pure', 'B', 'genius', 'compound', 'met', 'team', 'machismo', 'security', 'guards', 'who', 'are', 'wearing', 'fruitiest', 'neon', 'colored', 'shirts', 'end', 'countless', 'poorly', 'executed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'are', 'doled', 'out', 'Cody', 'exacting', 'revenge', 'Tong', 'down', 'so', 'bad', 'actually', 'away', 'fear', 'then', 'steak', 'knife', 'bad', 'guy', 'holding', 'wife', 'captive', 'Naturally', 'wife', 'film', 'just', 'very', 'matter', 'fact', 'nature.To', 'be', 'honest', 'Kickboxer', '4', 'was', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'overly', 'serious', 'vibe', 'going', 'depressing', 'undertone', 'absolutely', 'loved', 'drawn', 'out', 'fight', 'scenes', 'Bar', 'scene', 'leading', 'back', 'fight', 'early', 'David', 'guy', 'actually', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Don', 'Mattingly', 'sent', 'DMF', 'roof', 'beat', 'down', 'so', 'hard', 'thought', 'mustache', 'was', 'going', 'pop', 'off', 'addition', 'great', 'fighting', 'was', 'very', 'solid', 'rack', 'report', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'young', 'Sid', 'very', 'happy', 'Just', 'sheer', 'B', 'factor', 'fake', 'Tong', 'Po', 'was', 'enough', 'ear', 'film', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'guy', 'so', 'weird', 'looking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'eyes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'rooting', 'non', 'stop', 'fake', 'head', 'pop', 'off', 'unfortunately', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'satisfaction', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'credits', 'said', 'Van', 'Damme', 'played', 'Tong', 'Po', 'one', 'Now', 'case', 'then', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'awarded', '5', 'start', 'rating', 'would', 'mean', 'Van', 'Damme', 'was', 'so', 'embarrassed', 'be', 'part', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'made', 'up', 'different', 'character', 'avoid', 'recognition', 'Now', 'would', 'be', 'beautiful']",Kickboxer 4 VHS
412182,A2DWWZ6QIWBJ8D,6304286945,"Thomas ""moviedudereviews""","[3, 4]","Oh, what a mixed bag we have here! Sasha Mitchell returns for Kickboxer 3 as David Sloan along with the trainer (I don't know his name) from the first two Kickboxers. Instead of training in the ring, they take a vacation to Rio where David ends up fighting a champion kickboxer and along the way ends up getting caught in the traingle of a crimeboss who kidnaps and sells teenage girls. Overall, Kickboxer 3 doesn't have quite the martial arts action that the first two have which is probably why it received mixed reviews but it is an action packed movie no doubt. Kickboxer 3 is not oscar winning material (probably because it is direct to video) but it is worth a look if you liked the first two Kickboxers.Now for Kickboxer 4... I'll start off by saying that the Kickboxer series should haved ended as a trilogy because Kickboxer 4 suffers from ""direct to video"" script flaws. Sasha Mitchell yet again returns along with the character of Tong Po though played by a different actor. The trainer from the first three kickboxers does not return and after seeing this movie its no wonder why he didn't. And while I'm at it, this movie was not produced by the same person who did the first three Kickboxers. Ok, moving on... David Sloan learns while he is in prison (which goes unexplained as to how he got there) that his wife was mysteriously captured by Tong Po and in order to get her back he must fight in a tournament that is held by Tong Po. You find (if you choose to watch Kickboxer 4) that it is somewhat of a rip off of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon. None of the characters put up much of a fight and seeing Tong Po in action unlike Kickboxer 1 & 2 is an absolute joke. Like Kickboxer 3 however, this movie did have some likeable characters but that's about the extent of it. Overall, Kickboxer 4 is the bad apple of the series. I'll bet the producers discussing how to make this movie went something like this...
