The corny title song doesn't do justice to this poignant comedy drama starring Lynn Redgrave as the sweet shy quirky British lass who must confront the fact that she is a freak in the  nihilistic world of Swinging London.  The 1st rate comedy drama also stars  Alan Bates and James Mason.  Set in London it really gives the '60s British  feel.  Weather throughout the film:  rain followed by showers. Most  poignant is the interaction between Bates, the perpetual clown, and  Redgrave, only a clown to  hide the frown.

She's just wonderful in the title role.  Ably abetted by a wonderful supporting cast the film moves along briskly, thanks to an intelligently paced direction and there are relatively few lulls.  However, the DVD transfer is not that good.  The video aspect is pale and dull.  The audio is fine.  There is scene selection and subtitles.  The only other extra is a usless preview trailer of other modern movies being released on DVD.  That was a waste of money.  Given the lack of extras and the ""fair"" quality of the DVD transfer this DVD is not worth the price of $24.99 to $29.99 that it is going for.  The movie itself is great fun but I expected a decent transfer (not a pale one) and for the price I paid for it, we should have been given a commentary by Lynn Redgrave or at the very least, the theatrical trailer of the film.  That is why I give the DVD 3 stars.....the movie merits 4 stars.",3,"NOBODY YOU MEET COULD EVER SEE THE LONELINESS THERE...INSIDE YOU, HEY THERE, GEORGY GIRL",1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,1104,"['beginning', 'film', 'when', 'unforgettable', 'theme', 'song', 'sung', 'great', 'group', 'Seekers', 'see', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'Georgy', 'walking', 'down', 'street', 'one', 'are', 'hilarious', 'ride', 'just', 'wonderful', 'title', 'role', 'Ably', 'abetted', 'wonderful', 'supporting', 'cast', 'film', 'moves', 'briskly', 'thanks', 'intelligently', 'paced', 'direction', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'lulls', 'However', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'not', 'good', 'video', 'aspect', 'pale', 'dull', 'audio', 'fine', 'scene', 'selection', 'subtitles', 'only', 'other', 'extra', 'usless', 'preview', 'trailer', 'other', 'modern', 'movies', 'being', 'released', 'DVD', 'was', 'waste', 'money', 'Given', 'lack', 'extras', 'fair', 'quality', 'DVD', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'not', 'worth', 'price', '24.99', '29.99', 'going', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'expected', 'decent', 'transfer', 'not', 'pale', 'one', 'price', 'paid', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'commentary', 'Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'very', 'least', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'film', 'why', 'give', 'DVD', '3', 'stars', 'movie', 'merits', '4', 'stars']",N/A

337070,A2TJWNRBBU82FQ,6302806356,Cowboy Buddha,"[32, 34]","Another of those films from the Sixties that one tends to remember as being better than it really is, Georgy Girl is nonetheless an enjoyable little comedy - even if its style and attitudes now seem more quaint than innovative or even shocking. If nothing else, it has probably the catchiest theme song of any film from that music-obsessed era.Lyyn Redgrave is the title character - an eternal optimist with a quick wit, an open mind, and a body that was definitely out of place in a decade when everybody was nearly anorexic. She, of course, wants to be loved but fears that no man would want her. Incredibly, a couple of blokes do. One of them is James Mason, the well-to-do and unhappily married employer of Georgy's parents - a pair of morally uptight domestics. Mason, who has always had a ""fatherly"" interest in Georgy, now wants her to be his mistress and puts his proposition in the form of a business offer. (""Will we have annual meetings?"" asks Georgy.) Her other suitor - albeit initially a reluctant one - is Georgy's flatmate's randy boyfriend. As played by Alan Bates, he is a wonderful mix of easy charm, swagger, insecurity, lust and sharp one-liners, and easily steals most of the scenes he's in. Georgy's flatmate is the luscious Charlotte Rampling who is not only extremely sexy but manages to raise self-interest to an art form.In this atmosphere of free love and loose morals, Bates gets Rampling pregnant, has a fling with Redgrave before the birth, then, when Rampling realises she is not the maternal type and walks off, Bates and Redgrave set up house together with the baby. But Georgy, of course, loves the baby more than anyone and responsibility-shy Bates has no more interest in being a father than Rampling did in being a mother. Exit Bates, re-enter James Mason...Despite these somewhat dreary circumstances, the film plays everything mostly for laughs. Stuck in their drab black and white surroundings, the characters seem to refuse to take anything too seriously. That is left for the older generation to do, as exemplified by Bill Owen as Georgy's father and gentleman's gentleman to Mason. A look of disapproval sits permanently on his craggy face. This supporting performance is amazing, especially considering that Owen later became a national favourite by playing a rascally old reprobate in a long running British sitcom.Georgy Girl remains an enjoyable film primarily because it is filled with wonderfully quirky performances. Back in the Sixties, it seemed rather daring but it is very tame by today's standards. It is a typical film of its time - very Sixties and very British. American viewers may have to strain on occasion to catch all the dialogue and bits of slang may remain a mystery. But Georgy Girl remains a more honest and affecting romantic comedy than most of today's contrived output.",4,Vintage Sixties Comedy,1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,2841,"['films', 'Sixties', 'one', 'remember', 'being', 'better', 'really', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'nonetheless', 'enjoyable', 'little', 'comedy', 'even', 'style', 'attitudes', 'now', 'seem', 'more', 'quaint', 'innovative', 'even', 'shocking', 'nothing', 'else', 'probably', 'catchiest', 'theme', 'song', 'film', 'music-obsessed', 'era.Lyyn', 'Redgrave', 'title', 'character', 'eternal', 'optimist', 'quick', 'wit', 'open', 'mind', 'body', 'was', 'definitely', 'place', 'decade', 'when', 'everybody', 'was', 'nearly', 'anorexic', 'course', 'be', 'loved', 'fears', 'man', 'would', 'want', 'Incredibly', 'couple', 'blokes', 'do', 'One', 'James', 'Mason', 'well-to-do', 'unhappily', 'married', 'employer', 'Georgy', 'parents', 'pair', 'morally', 'uptight', 'domestics', 'Mason', 'who', 'always', 'had', 'fatherly', 'interest', 'Georgy', 'now', 'be', 'mistress', 'proposition', 'form', 'business', 'offer', 'Will', 'have', 'annual', 'meetings', 'Georgy', 'other', 'suitor', 'albeit', 'initially', 'reluctant', 'one', 'Georgy', 'flatmate', 'randy', 'boyfriend', 'played', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'easy', 'charm', 'swagger', 'insecurity', 'lust', 'sharp', 'one-liners', 'easily', 'steals', 'most', 'scenes', 'Georgy', 'flatmate', 'luscious', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'who', 'not', 'only', 'extremely', 'sexy', 'raise', 'self-interest', 'art', 'form.In', 'atmosphere', 'free', 'love', 'loose', 'morals', 'Bates', 'Rampling', 'pregnant', 'fling', 'Redgrave', 'birth', 'then', 'when', 'Rampling', 'realises', 'not', 'maternal', 'type', 'walks', 'off', 'Bates', 'Redgrave', 'set', 'up', 'house', 'together', 'baby', 'Georgy', 'course', 'baby', 'more', 'anyone', 'responsibility-shy', 'Bates', 'more', 'interest', 'being', 'father', 'Rampling', 'did', 'being', 'mother', 'Exit', 'Bates', 're-enter', 'James', 'Mason', 'somewhat', 'dreary', 'circumstances', 'film', 'everything', 'mostly', 'laughs', 'Stuck', 'drab', 'black', 'white', 'surroundings', 'characters', 'seem', 'refuse', 'take', 'anything', 'too', 'seriously', 'left', 'older', 'generation', 'do', 'exemplified', 'Bill', 'Owen', 'Georgy', 'father', 'gentleman', 'gentleman', 'Mason', 'look', 'disapproval', 'sits', 'permanently', 'craggy', 'face', 'supporting', 'performance', 'amazing', 'especially', 'considering', 'Owen', 'later', 'became', 'national', 'favourite', 'playing', 'rascally', 'old', 'reprobate', 'long', 'running', 'British', 'sitcom.Georgy', 'Girl', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'primarily', 'filled', 'wonderfully', 'quirky', 'performances', 'Back', 'Sixties', 'seemed', 'rather', 'daring', 'very', 'tame', 'today', 'standards', 'typical', 'film', 'time', 'very', 'Sixties', 'very', 'British', 'American', 'viewers', 'may', 'have', 'strain', 'occasion', 'catch', 'dialogue', 'bits', 'slang', 'may', 'remain', 'mystery', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'more', 'honest', 'affecting', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'most', 'today', 'contrived', 'output']",N/A

I can't think of enough superlatives to describe how good Lynn Redgrave is in the title role.  How she didn't win the Oscar in 1966(Liz Taylor won for ""Virginia Woolf"") is beyond me.  Redgrave just grabs on your heartstrings and doesn't let go.  There is an excellent supporting cast on hand here with James Mason sympathetic as Georgy's wealthy benefactor would-be-lover, Charlotte Rampling as her cold-hearted flatmate, and Alan Bates as her flatmate's husband.  This film was made in a period when social mores were changing over in the U.K. and Georgy's plight here is following her heart in light of these changes.

337073,A29VKODW4R5U7W,6302806356,dooby,"[33, 34]","This is a film which is better known for its title song than for the movie itself. Which is a little unfair because the film is quite delightful in its own quirky 60-ish fairytale way. Georgy, played by a young Lynn Redgrave is a plain, homely British girl living in the swinging London of the 60s. Her roommate, the ""sensational"" Meredith, played by an equally young and very sexy Charlotte Rampling, is intent on enjoying life to the fullest. While Meredith goes out partying every night, with or without her semi-steady boyfriend (Alan Bates), poor dowdy Georgy remains at home. When Meredith gets pregnant and decides to keep the baby, Georgy is exhilarated. Exhibiting maternal intincts sorely lacking in her fun-loving friend, she takes it upon herself to care for the baby while the real mother and father disappear back into the swinging single life. Acknowledging the fact that she wants to be a mother more than a trophy wife, and accepting her lack of looks in a society that values physical beauty above all else, she accepts the proposal of marriage from her father's elderly millionaire boss (James Mason). It is a fairytale tinged with the sadness of compromises which most of us would be all too familiar with in real life, but as the song goes in the final scene, ""at least he's a millionaire"". If you're familiar with the title song, watching the movie will bring an added poignancy to the words. A little sad at times but uplifting overall, this is a treasure from a bygone era.The movie was nominated for 4 Academy Awards including Best Actress, Supporting Actor, Cinematography and Best Song but won none, not even for its famous title song. ""Georgy Girl"" sung by The Seekers, lost out to John Barry's ""Born Free"" but has remained a classic ever since.Sony/Columbia have issued a barebones DVD with the film transferred in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio (anamorphic). This is obviously not the film's original theatrical aspect ratio simply because no films were shot in this ratio at that time. The original presentation was either 1.66:1 or 1.85:1 and it has been cropped so as to make a perfect fit for the new widescreen TV format. For years we have had to endure widescreen movies being panned-&-scanned to fit standard TV screens, now we have to endure movies being cropped to fit the new 16:9 widescreen TVs. When will these studio executives learn to leave viewers in peace to watch movies in their original presentation? That said, the visual composition of this transfer is not unduly harmed. This film was originally shot in Black and White, and it is presented that way on DVD, not in color as stated at Amazon's website. The picture looks fairly good with a certain amount of speckling on the source print but otherwise no overt print damage. Greyscale is fairly well rendered. Blacks are rich and deep but at the expense of shadow detail in darker portions of the image. Dark scenes look too dark. Sound is in the original 2.0 mono with optional English and Japanese subtitles. The music sounds just fine on this transfer.

337074,A106016KSI0YQ,6302806356,Jay Dickson,"[1, 2]","Silvio Narizzano's 1966 film bought into the Swinging London fantasy both Brits and Americans longed to see onscreen during the Johnson administration years, and celebrated an unusual menage a trois of a kind: the clunky, likable, overweight dogsbody Georgy (Lynn Redgrave), her sour and selfish roommate Meredith (Charlotte Rampling), and Meredith's manic handsome lover Jos (Alan Bates), who comes to care for Georgy. Complicating matters further is Georgy's suitor (James Mason), who is also the employer of her parents, and who wants to engage Georgy as a kind of contractual mistress. It's a very strange and ungainly story--often just loud when it means to be absurdly romantic--, and the characters don't quite interact the way that real human beings actually do. But the Cinderella aspect of Georgy's story proved very popular with audiences (so much so that it was more or less re-made decades later as MURIEL'S WEDDING), and they also found Bates's freewheeling libidinousness and his loud public declarations of love for Georgy very sexy. Those who have never seen this famous film will probably be surprised at how different the great character actress Lynn Redgrave is from her later more dignified appearances: she almost entirely disappears into this role.",3,"That's all you wanted right from the start...

This is not the first time this happened....Amazon, you need to fix this reviewing process!!!!I'll make it shorter.Basically, although the acting was alright, I HATED the movie, because I hated all of the characters in it, except for baby Sara!  Although Georgy had some redeeming character traits, she totally disappointed me in the end, marrying an old man (her father's employer), just so she could keep the baby and be rich.  She did not care about him, and she definitely did not love him.  The man pursues her throughout the movie, even though he is married to someone else, and old enough to be her father.  Her father, instead of telling him to leave his daughter alone, tells her she ought to be grateful for anything the old man does for her, and is always telling the man that no one would want Georgy.  Georgy falls for her roommate's boyfriend and he for her, until she ignores him for the baby (his baby he had with the roommate Meredith).  Meredith the roommate has already had two abortions by her boyfriend Jos, so decides to marry him and have the baby instead, since she is bored and wants to try something new.  Everyone keeps saying how beautiful she is, but I cannot see beyond her ugly personality.  She remains ""ugly"" to me throughout the movie.  She hates being pregnant, hates her new baby, Sara, and even calls her baby ugly.  She wants to put the baby up for adoption, but Georgy wants to keep her, and her boyfriend, Jos.  Meredith goes off with some other man, Jos lives in the apartment with Georgy and Sara, but gets upset when all Georgy wants to do is take care of the baby.  All Jos wants to do is have sex with Georgy and go out and have fun.  After he loses his job and it is discovered that Georgy is not his wife, child protective services plan on taking baby Sara away, so Georgy tells the old man that has been pursuing her (his wife has died somehow, during all of this) that she will have a relationship with him (she will sleep with him), if he agrees to marry her, and let her keep baby Sara.  Jos has taken off and left his baby (and Georgy) behind.  At the end of the movie, the old man, Georgy, and the baby are leaving (for the honeymoon?), while the Seekers sing ""Georgy Girl"", saying she has finally gotten what she wanted all along:  the baby.  And even though she doesn't love her husband, oh well, now she is rich!  All of the characters are disgusting to me in this movie, except for baby Sara!  Too bad she was not put up for adoption to some nice people from another movie entirely!  Don't understand the glowing reviews...how can you like a movie when almost all of the characters are selfish, self-centered pigs?Well, at least the title song is good!",1,Don't know where to start....,1273708800,"05 13, 2010",2010,2822,"['just', 'finished', 'typing', 'long', 'review', 'whole', 'thing', 'disappeared', 'screen', 'reviewed', 'not', 'first', 'time', 'happened', '.Amazon', 'need', 'fix', 'reviewing', 'process', ""'ll"", 'make', 'shorter.Basically', 'acting', 'was', 'alright', 'HATED', 'movie', 'hated', 'characters', 'baby', 'Sara', 'Georgy', 'had', 'redeeming', 'character', 'traits', 'totally', 'disappointed', 'end', 'marrying', 'old', 'man', 'father', 'employer', 'just', 'could', 'keep', 'baby', 'be', 'rich', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'definitely', 'did', 'not', 'love', 'man', 'movie', 'even', 'married', 'someone', 'else', 'old', 'enough', 'be', 'father', 'father', 'instead', 'telling', 'leave', 'daughter', 'alone', 'ought', 'be', 'grateful', 'anything', 'old', 'man', 'always', 'telling', 'man', 'one', 'would', 'want', 'Georgy', 'Georgy', 'roommate', 'boyfriend', 'baby', 'baby', 'had', 'roommate', 'Meredith', 'Meredith', 'roommate', 'already', 'had', 'two', 'abortions', 'boyfriend', 'Jos', 'so', 'marry', 'have', 'baby', 'instead', 'bored', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'Everyone', 'saying', 'how', 'beautiful', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'ugly', 'personality', 'ugly', 'movie', 'being', 'pregnant', 'new', 'baby', 'Sara', 'even', 'baby', 'ugly', 'put', 'baby', 'up', 'adoption', 'Georgy', 'keep', 'boyfriend', 'Jos', 'Meredith', 'off', 'other', 'man', 'Jos', 'apartment', 'Georgy', 'Sara', 'upset', 'when', 'Georgy', 'do', 'take', 'care', 'baby', 'Jos', 'do', 'have', 'sex', 'Georgy', 'go', 'out', 'have', 'fun', 'job', 'discovered', 'Georgy', 'not', 'wife', 'child', 'protective', 'services', 'plan', 'taking', 'baby', 'Sara', 'away', 'Georgy', 'old', 'man', 'been', 'pursuing', 'wife', 'died', 'somehow', 'will', 'have', 'relationship', 'will', 'sleep', 'marry', 'let', 'keep', 'baby', 'Sara', 'Jos', 'taken', 'off', 'left', 'baby', 'Georgy', 'end', 'movie', 'old', 'man', 'Georgy', 'baby', 'are', 'leaving', 'honeymoon', 'Seekers', 'sing', 'Georgy', 'Girl', 'saying', 'finally', 'gotten', 'what', 'wanted', 'baby', 'even', ""n't"", 'love', 'husband', 'oh', 'well', 'now', 'rich', 'characters', 'are', 'disgusting', 'movie', 'baby', 'Sara', 'Too', 'bad', 'was', 'not', 'put', 'up', 'adoption', 'nice', 'people', 'movie', 'entirely', 'Do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'how', 'can', 'like', 'movie', 'when', 'almost', 'characters', 'are', 'selfish', 'self-centered', 'pigs', 'Well', 'least', 'title', 'song', 'good']",N/A

337079,A1OBJ2263JCK5,6302806356,Kenneth M. Gelwasser,"[9, 12]","In the mid 1960's ""Swingin' London"" became the cultural capitol of the western world. From every radio, you could hear British music groups like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who. Young women started wearing their skirts very short, while their male counterparts wore slick, 'Mod' suits with skinny ties. Young people were starting to experiment with illegal, recreational drugs and the rules of sexual behavior were being tested and broken down. The 'Baby Boomers' were coming of age and they felt stifled and ready to burst from the conservative 1950's attitudes of the generation, that came before them. It is in this time and setting of cultural upheaval, that the wonderful 1966 comedy/drama ""Georgy Girl"" takes place. In the film we meet Georgy (Lynn Redgrave) an overweight and rather ungainly young women, who's looks and sensibilities just don't seem to fit in with the fashionable culture of the time. Her own father (Bill Owen) tells his employer (James Mason) that ""she looks like a lorrie (truck) driver"". Georgy has very little self-esteem for herself, yet shows a great zest for life. She makes a living as a preschool teacher and lives in a small flat with her roomate, Meredith. Meredith (Charlotte Rampling) is Georgy's opposite. She's a beautiful, party girl, who has little regard for for the feelings of others, no matter what the consequences are. Things change, when Meredith becomes pregnant. She marries the father, Jos (Alan Bates), but seems to have little love for her new husband or her pregnancy, since they both cramp her wild, party lifestyle. To say that this women dosn't have a maternal bone in her body would be a understatement. When she announces her pregnancy she declares, ""well, I'm not going to get rid of this one"". Once the baby is born, Meredith won't even touch it. She wants the baby adopted, before she even leaves the hospital. Georgy is heart broken by Meredith's cruel attitude and actions. Georgy becomes romantically involved with Jos, and the two attempt to raise the baby. It is within this scenario, that Georgy finds herself and learns, what she wants out of life. Director, Silvio Narizzano has created a lively, energetic film that truely 'gets' the attitudes and feelings of that time and place. Screenwriters, Margaret Forster & Peter Nichols give us a script that is both funny and moving. The film's cast is perfect! Lynne Redgrave as Georgy, gives a performance that is just a beautiful mixture of humor and pathos. Charlotte Rampling's cold, party girl, Meredith is just the ultimate, unfeeling, b_tch. You just want to slap her! Alan Bates also gives a good performance showing a young man, who's joyful veneer hides an inability to take any sort of responsibility. A special mention should also be made for James Mason's fine turn as an older, wealthy man, who has the 'Hots' for Georgy and ultimately shows how much he cares for her. Finally I want to mention Cinematographer, Kenneth Higgins' brilliant, B&W photography, that gives the film an almost documentary-like, 'you are there' feeling and immediacy. This is a wonderfully, funny, moving film.

If only they had managed to find even one ""deleted scene"" featuring Charlotte Rampling, whose disappearance from the movie far too early is the biggest disappointment of them all.  (After she leaves, a bit of the film's energy goes with her; the audience feels deflated, like a paper bag.)  GEORGY GIRL was a huge hit for Columbia in 1966, one of the biggest of the year, and it still holds up today.  Lynn Redgrave was nominated for an Oscar, and the press made much of a possible rivalry with her far more glamorous sister Vanessa, who was also nominated the same year.  Neither sister won, for the prize was taken from them by Elizabeth Taylor's stylish harridan in WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?  Rachel Kempson, mother to Lynn and Vanessa, has a nice character part in GEORGY GIRL as well, in a role which makes her a sort of romantic rival to Lynn's character-a little kinky.Lynn plays Georgy Parkin, a dumpy instructor whose parents are very old-school servants to a wealthy gentleman played by James Mason.  Georgy lives on her own with a gorgeous roommate called Meredith-the part played by Charlotte Rampling without vanity, without pretense, Rampling unafraid of seeming unsympathetic in a way that would be unthinkable to most US actresses of her generation.  She's so awful you start to like her.  And she's the wife's worst nightmare, and then she gets pregnant with Alan Bates' baby and the picture really launches into gear.  Unusually for a 1960s movie, GEORGY GIRL is really a ""woman's picture"" which in the old days which have paired Miriam Hopkins against Bette Davis, and the plot, such as it is, is all about how will Georgy attain a shred of self-esteem if she's always comparing herself to supermodel-thin Meredith?On top of everything else, the film also forecasts BRIDGET JONES by having two men fall in love with Georgy, but I can't say which ones, that would be telling.

Nevertheless, over the course of the events that play out in this film, she suddenly finds herself almost irresistible to men--from the boyfriend (Alan Bates) of her irritable and self-centered flatmate (Charlotte Rampling), to the wealthy employer (James Mason) of her live-in servant parents.  Many amusing and ironic plot twists result from Georgie's unassuming assessment of her world, and the effect that her pleasant and loving nature has on all but the most callous who come in contact with her.  Using Georgie as the focus, this comedy exposes many of the contradictions inherent in the modern world, such as the romantic expectations of marriage and motherhood, while showing the timeless value of genuine love and caring.",5,"An ironic satire of love, marriage, motherhood, and class--set in 1960's London",1349654400,"10 8, 2012",2012,921,"['Lynn', 'Redgrave', 'incredibly', 'appealing', 'title', 'character', 'bright', 'interesting', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'unattractive', 'men', 'part', 'due', 'being', 'slightly', 'overweight', 'Nevertheless', 'course', 'events', 'play', 'out', 'film', 'suddenly', 'almost', 'irresistible', 'men', 'boyfriend', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'irritable', 'self-centered', 'flatmate', 'Charlotte', 'Rampling', 'wealthy', 'employer', 'James', 'Mason', 'live-in', 'servant', 'parents', 'Many', 'amusing', 'ironic', 'plot', 'twists', 'result', 'Georgie', 'unassuming', 'assessment', 'world', 'effect', 'pleasant', 'loving', 'nature', 'most', 'callous', 'who', 'come', 'contact', 'Using', 'Georgie', 'focus', 'comedy', 'many', 'contradictions', 'inherent', 'modern', 'world', 'such', 'romantic', 'expectations', 'marriage', 'motherhood', 'showing', 'timeless', 'value', 'genuine', 'love', 'caring']",N/A

337092,A4UKBG3M5U5TI,6302806356,Westley,"[78, 81]","Lynn Redgrave stars as Georgy, an awkward young woman living in 60s swinging London.  Her roommate Meredith (Charlotte Rampling) is gorgeous and has men lining up to woo her, including her somewhat clownish long-time beau, Jos (Alan Bates).  Poor Georgy has only James (James Mason) chasing after her; he's the much older employer of her butler father.  However, clearly Georgy wants much more - will she take chances to get the life she desires?""Georgy Girl"" is a marvelous movie that flawlessley combines comedy and drama.  I had put off watching this movie, as I thought it would be another dated comedy from the era.  However, the film is fairly universal in theme and technique.  As is typical for movies of this era, there's a sadness underlying all the wacky shenanigans and a plethora of moral issues bubble under the surface.  Many hit movies from the 60s explored moral issues - here it's all about monogamy and marriage.  However, very few movies from that era stand up this well; the film never comes across as preachy or over-reaching.All elements blend beautifully in ""Georgy Girl.""  Lynn Redgrave gives the performance of her career - she manages to make Georgy by turns wacky and vulnerable,  but always endearing.  She deservedly won the Golden Globe for Best Actress (Musical/Comedy) and was nominated for an Oscar.  Alan Bates is also very good, although toward the end he starts to be a bit grating.  He was nominated for a Golden Globe but passed over by the Oscars.  Finally, James Mason was Oscar nominated for his role as Georgy's pursuer.  Credit should also go to director Silvio Narizzano who balances all of this craziness, allowing the melancholy to shine through the laughs; unfortunately, his career peaked with this effort - none of his previous or subsequent films made much impact.Perhaps my favorite part of the movie is the title and end credits, over which the Seekers' hit song ""Georgy Girl"" plays.  I've heard the song a million times, never paying close attention to the lyrics.  However, in the title sequence, the song perfectly sums up Georgy as she walks down a crowded British street.  Redgrave's acting is impeccable here - title sequences don't usually require much acting, but she totally scores.  Likewise, the song plays over the end credits, again neatly summarizing what has happened and where everyone will go from here.  The lyrics for this section of the song apparently aren't in the hit single version, so you won't know the ending just from having heard the song.In some ways, ""Georgy Girl"" is a precursor to ""Muriel's Wedding"" and any number of other movies about so-called `ugly ducklings' who find their confidence before the end credits roll.  However, this genre has never been done so well as here.  Overall, ""Georgy Girl"" is a tremendous surprise: a nearly perfect comedy that deftly explores some potentially difficult topics.
