333322,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6302772729,Byron Kolln,"[0, 0]","Based on Ira Levin's hit Broadway play, CRITIC'S CHOICE (1963) marked the final screen pairing for the beloved comedy duo Bob Hope and Lucille Ball; and I think it's the perfect last fling.Parker Ballantine (Bob Hope) is New York's most feared and revered theatre critic.  One stroke of his pen can cause a show to post closing notices, and he's even been responsible for putting his actress ex-wife Ivy (Marilyn Maxwell) out of work on several occasions!  When his second wife Angela (Lucille Ball) decides to write a play based on her colourful mother, Parker experiences every critic's worst nightmare: how on earth will he manage to stay neutral and honestly review the play just as he would any other?  And how will Angie react if he pans the entire affair?!  Angie's Broadway bow might just end in the divorce court in this snappy backstage comedy.Rumoured to be loosely based on Walter and Jean Kerr, CRITIC'S CHOICE is filled with choice (no pun intended) comedy moments for each star to shine.  Jessie Royce Landis co-stars as Ball's mother, with Rip Torn, Marie Windsor, Joan Shawlee, Jim Backus and Ricky Kelman.The DVD includes the 1935 VitaPhone short ""Calling All Tars"" with Bob Hope, plus a Looney Tunes cartoon (""Now Hear This"") and the trailer.  Also available in theLucille Ball Film Collection (Dance Girl Dance / The Big Street / Du Barry Was a Lady / Critic's Choice / Mame).",4,"Ball and Hope star in a ""Choice"" comedy romp",1261958400,"12 28, 2009",2009,1396,"['Based', 'Ira', 'Levin', 'hit', 'Broadway', 'play', 'CRITIC', 'CHOICE', '1963', 'marked', 'final', 'screen', 'pairing', 'beloved', 'comedy', 'duo', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'think', 'perfect', 'last', 'fling.Parker', 'Ballantine', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'New', 'York', 'most', 'feared', 'revered', 'theatre', 'critic', 'One', 'stroke', 'pen', 'can', 'cause', 'show', 'post', 'closing', 'notices', 'even', 'been', 'responsible', 'putting', 'actress', 'ex-wife', 'Ivy', 'Marilyn', 'Maxwell', 'work', 'several', 'occasions', 'When', 'second', 'wife', 'Angela', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'write', 'play', 'based', 'colourful', 'mother', 'Parker', 'critic', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'how', 'earth', 'will', 'manage', 'stay', 'neutral', 'honestly', 'review', 'play', 'just', 'would', 'other', 'how', 'will', 'Angie', 'react', 'entire', 'affair', 'Angie', 'Broadway', 'bow', 'might', 'just', 'end', 'divorce', 'court', 'snappy', 'backstage', 'comedy.Rumoured', 'be', 'loosely', 'based', 'Walter', 'Jean', 'Kerr', 'CRITIC', 'CHOICE', 'filled', 'choice', 'pun', 'intended', 'comedy', 'moments', 'star', 'shine', 'Jessie', 'Royce', 'Landis', 'co-stars', 'Ball', 'mother', 'Rip', 'Torn', 'Marie', 'Windsor', 'Joan', 'Shawlee', 'Jim', 'Backus', 'Ricky', 'Kelman.The', 'DVD', '1935', 'VitaPhone', 'short', 'Calling', 'Tars', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Looney', 'Tunes', 'cartoon', 'Now', 'Hear', 'trailer', 'Also', 'available', 'theLucille', 'Ball', 'Film', 'Collection', 'Dance', 'Girl', 'Dance', '/', 'Big', 'Street', '/', 'Du', 'Barry', 'Was', 'Lady', '/', 'Critic', 'Choice', '/', 'Mame']",N/A

Instead, it's a movie about a control freak (Hope) who spends most of his screen time belittling his wife and everyone else he deems beneath him (mostly playwrights).  He encourages his son and his mother-in-law to gang up on his wife to keep her from writing a play he knows he will hate.  ""Angie, you can't even write a letter.""  To everyone's surprise, she writes the play anyway and inexplicably hands it over to her husband who has already told her he will rip it apart.  He does just that.  (And now that you've got that out of your system, go back to being a good housewife and stepmother.)  What follows is a lot of pouting on everyone's part, no end of snide comments, and a drunken Parker arriving late to his wife's play (his balcony antics disrupt the performance of the play, proving his determination to write a scathing review no matter what, on a play he never even fully watched).  If the point was to portray critics as merciless, vicious, ""opinionated sneaks,"" then this film succeeded.  If this was supposed to be a fun comedy, it only provided a few sporadic laughs (like Hope telling all his troubles to Dr. William Von Hagedorn, played by Jim Backus).  Otherwise, it fell short of that goal.  It's never fun watching someone demean another person, someone they claim to love, just to prove a point.

Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, as well as other major stars, sounds like the makings of something great, right?Wrong!  The story is based on a stage play about a mean-spirited movie critic who writes derisive reviews of theatrical plays, causing many of them to fail.  But his nastiness doesn't stop there; he is also obnoxious and belittling to his wife and son, as well as his friends...yet he expects people to like him anyway, and in fact attaches a great deal of importance to his job, saying he is doing this as a matter of principle.  His wife has the ambition to write her own play, but the critic derides her for even thinking about it.  She does so anyway, asking her husband not to deride it, but he refuses her request due to the matter of his high principles which he cannot abandon.  We didn't bother to finish, the whole thing was so unpleasant rather than funny.Perhaps this might have been funny in the theater, but it certainly wasn't funny here.  Hope's character was a nasty man with no redeeming features whatsoever, and Lucille Ball gave the dullest performance of her career.  If she performed like she did in her other movies, she would have smashed a typewriter over her husband's head.  I was ready to do that to whoever came up with this sorry mess in the first place.

333330,A3I9PUR2E3BSJC,6302772729,"Ruth Anderson ""Book Reviewer""","[0, 0]","Critic's Choice is the fourth on-screen pairing of comedy titans Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (following Sorrowful Jones, Fancy Pants, and The Facts of Life), and I'd probably rank it as my favorite of their films together. Hope and Ball play off each other extremely well, and it's no stretch at all to imagine them as a married couple. Hope plays a high-brow New York theater critic known for how he relishes in eviscerating plays through his reviews. When his wife (Ball) takes it into her head to write a play based on her childhood, and when said play is actually finished and goes into production, the result is (mostly) comic marital discord. The feel of the movie kind of reminds me of the classic rom-coms Doris Day and Rock Hudson made together, only a shade deeper and more serious in how it deals with relationship friction between a married couple. For my money this flick is a thoroughly enjoyable way to while away a couple of hours. It's well-scripted, fast-paced, and does an excellent job of balancing humor with the more serious emotional and relationship issues Hope and Ball have to work through regarding their clashing careers, his clingy ex-wife, and her admiring director. The DVD has two extras - one, the comedy short Calling All Tars, is a lot of fun and is actually one of Bob Hope's earliest screen appearances, while the second is the so-so cartoon ""Now Hear This.""",5,My favorite Hope/Ball film!,1236988800,"03 14, 2009",2009,1393,"['Critic', 'Choice', 'fourth', 'on-screen', 'pairing', 'comedy', 'titans', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'following', 'Sorrowful', 'Jones', 'Fancy', 'Pants', 'Facts', 'Life', ""'d"", 'probably', 'rank', 'favorite', 'films', 'together', 'Hope', 'Ball', 'play', 'off', 'other', 'extremely', 'well', 'stretch', 'imagine', 'married', 'couple', 'Hope', 'high-brow', 'New', 'York', 'theater', 'critic', 'known', 'how', 'eviscerating', 'plays', 'reviews', 'When', 'wife', 'Ball', 'head', 'write', 'play', 'based', 'childhood', 'when', 'said', 'play', 'actually', 'finished', 'production', 'result', 'mostly', 'comic', 'marital', 'discord', 'feel', 'movie', 'kind', 'reminds', 'classic', 'rom-coms', 'Doris', 'Day', 'Rock', 'Hudson', 'made', 'together', 'only', 'shade', 'deeper', 'more', 'serious', 'how', 'relationship', 'friction', 'married', 'couple', 'money', 'flick', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'while', 'away', 'couple', 'hours', 'well-scripted', 'fast-paced', 'excellent', 'job', 'balancing', 'humor', 'more', 'serious', 'emotional', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Hope', 'Ball', 'have', 'work', 'regarding', 'clashing', 'careers', 'clingy', 'ex-wife', 'admiring', 'director', 'DVD', 'two', 'extras', 'one', 'comedy', 'short', 'Calling', 'Tars', 'lot', 'fun', 'actually', 'one', 'Bob', 'Hope', 'earliest', 'screen', 'appearances', 'second', 'so-so', 'cartoon', 'Now', 'Hear']",N/A

There are a few funny scenes, but Hope does not play the part of a clown in this picture. I would like to compare this film with ""The Fountainhead,"" because the theme of integrity is the engine, which fuels both pictures. Hope's wife, Lucille Ball writes a play. Incidentally, Ball is another one, with talent outside of the realm of comedy and became a very good dramatic actress. Hope, a critic, has the duty to review Ball's play. If Hope allowed another critic to review it, then that would be an evasion of duty and responsibility to the public. If Hope made a dishonest review, because otherwise, this review would jeopardize his marriage, then he would lack integrity. Allow me say, that Ball has no talent and her play is no good. Hope will not deceive the public into spending their hard-earned money on a worthless production and gives a poor review of the play. Needless to say, Ball is furious and besides herself. This is a risk, Hope was willing to take. Like spanking a child for disobedience, Hope figures, if you are in the right, then the injured party will come around to your point of view and forgive you. Ball realizes she has no talent in writing plays, but her talent lies in being a good housewife. Ball forgivew Hope. Today, we need integrity. This picture teaches integrity. Never abandon your sense of duty and never be dishonest, just do your job and do it right. Hope risked his personal life's happiness, because he refused to deceive the public and would not allow another critic to deceive them either.
