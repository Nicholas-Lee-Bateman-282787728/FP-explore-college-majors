Mcgorm ""tiddles""","[0, 0]","Very interesting movies which I didn't mind buying as I like action and these I haven't seen before, All different and not classed as A grade but close. Plenty of action in all of them very watchable and with the mixed group there is something for everyone, The effects are marvelous and the presentation by the actors and cast are great making you get interested so much that you don't wont to move in case you miss something, All the movies are on the go from start to finish. Never a dull moment so much happening  I can't tell you everything so that's it for now. Don't want to spoil it for you. So another night relaxing and eating my munchies, feet up enjoying fantastic entertainment, what more do I need. So see for yourself and be your own judge.
