1070912,A3RX6E9EP1J5WW,B000PGTPH8,A Christy,"[1, 1]","As a history buff I probably should be huffing and puffing about the inaccuracy, but I find that I don't care. I just enjoyed the story for what it was. This, the second and last season of Rome, was a very satisfying one for entertainment.The second season revolves around what happens after Julius Caesar is killed. Some actual history makes it in there...Mark Antony in Egypt...the Triad, etc. But even that which is known to have occurred is glossed up in really juicy ways in this production.I've always been vaguely suspicious of Augustus in history. Something just doesn't add up with that fellow and I've always thought there must be something very dark and dirty down below to create the dynasty that followed (even though they weren't his biological children). In Rome we see how the Hollywood set decides what that dark and dirty bit is. And he is creepy with his unblinking eyes and inhuman calculations.Atia features prominantly this season again, much to my utter viewing joy, since she is just so very wicked and yet so entirely human that nothing she does surprises me anymore. And boy, does she reap what she has sown or what? Most of the other characters are there as well, some we liked and others not.And the best character of all, Pullo...with Vorenus in there somewhere...are also highly featured, of course. This season, the shine has come off of Vorenus for me and his story line is one that I'm not overly fond of. Titus Pullo, on the other hand, is his dimwitted best and certainly gets the last laugh out of it all. His challenges this season will, absolutely, make you cry if you're alone. Yes, even if you're a guy. He may be an uncouth brute, but he is the most human out of all the personages in this drama.My only gripe is the sex. There is just too much of it and it is too graphic. I just don't need to see this. I really wish they would come up with a BluRay ability to ""create your own rating"" where that can be redirected or skipped. Sort of like happens when you see it censored for regular cable TV. It's so graphic that parents should ensure they keep this set locked up if they buy it and away from little eyes who'll see the sword on the cover and pop it right in the DVD player.Great series for fans of excitingly innacurate but super fun to watch period dramas.",5,"Lushly Filmed, Totally Innacurate and I Loved Every Minute of It",1349049600,"10 1, 2012",2012,2304,"['history', 'buff', 'probably', 'should', 'be', 'huffing', 'puffing', 'inaccuracy', 'find', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'just', 'enjoyed', 'story', 'what', 'was', 'second', 'last', 'season', 'Rome', 'was', 'very', 'satisfying', 'one', 'entertainment.The', 'second', 'season', 'around', 'what', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'killed', 'actual', 'history', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Egypt', 'Triad', 'etc', 'even', 'known', 'have', 'occurred', 'glossed', 'up', 'really', 'juicy', 'ways', 'production.I', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'vaguely', 'suspicious', 'Augustus', 'history', 'Something', 'just', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'fellow', ""'ve"", 'always', 'thought', 'must', 'be', 'something', 'very', 'dark', 'dirty', 'down', 'create', 'dynasty', 'followed', 'even', 'were', ""n't"", 'biological', 'children', 'Rome', 'see', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'set', 'what', 'dark', 'dirty', 'bit', 'creepy', 'unblinking', 'eyes', 'inhuman', 'calculations.Atia', 'prominantly', 'season', 'again', 'much', 'utter', 'viewing', 'joy', 'just', 'so', 'very', 'wicked', 'yet', 'so', 'entirely', 'human', 'nothing', 'surprises', 'anymore', 'boy', 'reap', 'what', 'sown', 'what', 'Most', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'there', 'as', 'well', 'liked', 'others', 'not.And', 'best', 'character', 'Pullo', 'Vorenus', 'somewhere', 'are', 'also', 'highly', 'featured', 'course', 'season', 'shine', 'come', 'Vorenus', 'story', 'line', 'one', ""'m"", 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'other', 'hand', 'dimwitted', 'best', 'certainly', 'last', 'laugh', 'challenges', 'season', 'will', 'absolutely', 'make', 'cry', ""'re"", 'alone', 'Yes', 'even', ""'re"", 'guy', 'may', 'be', 'uncouth', 'brute', 'most', 'human', 'personages', 'drama.My', 'only', 'gripe', 'sex', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'too', 'graphic', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'see', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'come', 'up', 'BluRay', 'ability', 'create', 'own', 'rating', 'where', 'can', 'be', 'redirected', 'skipped', 'Sort', 'happens', 'when', 'see', 'censored', 'regular', 'cable', 'TV', 'so', 'graphic', 'parents', 'should', 'ensure', 'keep', 'set', 'locked', 'up', 'buy', 'away', 'little', 'eyes', 'who', ""'ll"", 'see', 'sword', 'cover', 'pop', 'right', 'DVD', 'player.Great', 'series', 'fans', 'excitingly', 'innacurate', 'super', 'fun', 'watch', 'period', 'dramas']",Rome:S2 (DVD)
1070913,A2YOSGV8YE3NJ8,B000PGTPH8,Adam,"[25, 27]","First, I have to confess that I don't own nor do I currently intend to purchase the DVD set for either season of Rome.  I have, however, been a loyal viewer of Rome ever since it's debut up until the recent series finale.  It's rare that I'll religiously watch a drama such as this while it's on TV, as I usually prefer to wait for the release of the DVDs so I can watch an entire season in a short period of time - the fact that I made an exception for Rome is a tribute to this excellent HBO series.Season II (naturally) begins where Season 1 left off - Caesar is dead and Octavian (Caesar's nephew), Mark Antony, and Brutus (who is allied with the majority of the Senate) become embroiled in a struggle for power.  Like Season I, the story is told primarily from the perspective of two Roman soldiers - Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, and like Season I these two characters are the real stars of the show.  Both are great characters, and the way they are utilized by Rome's creators to bridge the gap between ruling class and commoner is simply brilliant.  In Season II, the paths of Vorenus and Pullo diverge from those of Octavian and Mark Antony from time to time, but they cross just often enough to pull everything together into a cohesive and well told story.  I won't go into any more detail as to the adventures these two undergo in Season II as that would spoil the enjoyment, but suffice to say if you thought they were great characters in Season I you won't be disappointed.Sure, Rome is a bit sensationalized and has lots of sex and violence, but it offers much more than that.  It has a complex storyline rife with political struggles, betrayal, family disputes, war, and yes, sex and violence.  It's also visually stunning (it's little wonder the show was so expensive to produce), and it's packed with excellent, memorable characters.  Do not be led to believe that the prevalence of sex and violence makes this a brainless, plotless, predictable action flick, because it is much more than that - it's truly a great and well-told story.  Sure it's a little over-dramatized at times and it isn't perfectly historically accurate, but at the end of the day this is dramatic television meant to succeed commercially with an American audience, so this is to be expected.I'll admit I was disappointed to learn that Season 2 would wrap up the highly enjoyable Rome series.  I'll miss it.  On the other hand, Rome tells a great story and it tells it well, and it then it ends - and that can be a good thing.  Too many good television series continue to run long past the point where the story has been told and simply fade into mediocrity (cough Sopranos cough).  At least Rome isn't doing that.  But the fact that I won't be able to watch any new episodes of Rome makes me envy those of you who are new to this excellent series that much more.In short - if you enjoyed Season I, the Series is definitely worth continuing.  If you haven't seen Season I but enjoy good drama and aren't offended by a little sex and violence, Rome is one of a very small number of television series I'd call an absolute ""must see"".  The DVDs are a bit pricey, but they are in my opinion worth purchasing for those who didn't catch the Series on HBO.",5,Simply Excellent,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,3240,"['First', 'have', 'confess', 'do', ""n't"", 'own', 'do', 'currently', 'intend', 'purchase', 'DVD', 'set', 'season', 'Rome', 'have', 'however', 'been', 'loyal', 'viewer', 'Rome', 'ever', 'debut', 'up', 'recent', 'series', 'finale', 'rare', ""'ll"", 'religiously', 'watch', 'drama', 'such', 'TV', 'usually', 'prefer', 'wait', 'release', 'DVDs', 'can', 'watch', 'entire', 'season', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'fact', 'made', 'exception', 'Rome', 'tribute', 'excellent', 'HBO', 'series.Season', 'II', 'naturally', 'where', 'Season', '1', 'left', 'off', 'Caesar', 'dead', 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'nephew', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Brutus', 'who', 'allied', 'majority', 'Senate', 'become', 'embroiled', 'struggle', 'power', 'Season', 'story', 'told', 'primarily', 'perspective', 'two', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'Season', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'great', 'characters', 'way', 'are', 'utilized', 'Rome', 'creators', 'bridge', 'gap', 'ruling', 'class', 'commoner', 'simply', 'brilliant', 'Season', 'II', 'paths', 'Vorenus', 'Pullo', 'diverge', 'Octavian', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'time', 'time', 'cross', 'just', 'often', 'enough', 'pull', 'everything', 'together', 'cohesive', 'well', 'told', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'go', 'more', 'detail', 'adventures', 'two', 'undergo', 'Season', 'II', 'would', 'spoil', 'enjoyment', 'suffice', 'say', 'thought', 'were', 'great', 'characters', 'Season', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed.Sure', 'Rome', 'bit', 'sensationalized', 'lots', 'sex', 'violence', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'storyline', 'rife', 'political', 'struggles', 'betrayal', 'family', 'disputes', 'war', 'yes', 'sex', 'violence', 'also', 'visually', 'stunning', 'little', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'expensive', 'produce', 'packed', 'excellent', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'led', 'believe', 'prevalence', 'sex', 'violence', 'brainless', 'plotless', 'predictable', 'action', 'flick', 'much', 'more', 'truly', 'great', 'well-told', 'story', 'Sure', 'little', 'over-dramatized', 'times', ""n't"", 'perfectly', 'historically', 'accurate', 'end', 'day', 'dramatic', 'television', 'meant', 'succeed', 'commercially', 'American', 'audience', 'be', 'expected.I', ""'ll"", 'admit', 'was', 'disappointed', 'learn', 'Season', '2', 'would', 'wrap', 'up', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'Rome', 'series', ""'ll"", 'miss', 'other', 'hand', 'Rome', 'great', 'story', 'well', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'thing', 'Too', 'many', 'good', 'television', 'series', 'continue', 'run', 'long', 'point', 'where', 'story', 'been', 'told', 'simply', 'fade', 'mediocrity', 'cough', 'Sopranos', 'cough', 'least', 'Rome', ""n't"", 'doing', 'fact', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'watch', 'new', 'episodes', 'Rome', 'who', 'are', 'new', 'excellent', 'series', 'much', 'more.In', 'short', 'enjoyed', 'Season', 'Series', 'definitely', 'worth', 'continuing', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Season', 'enjoy', 'good', 'drama', 'are', ""n't"", 'offended', 'little', 'sex', 'violence', 'Rome', 'one', 'very', 'small', 'number', 'television', 'series', ""'d"", 'call', 'absolute', 'must', 'see', 'DVDs', 'are', 'bit', 'pricey', 'are', 'opinion', 'purchasing', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'Series', 'HBO']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

Wautier ""boulonman""","[0, 0]","Hello y'all,I belevied I covered &#34;ROME&#34; in my first season review, but for those who may have missed it, the above headline pretty much says it all in a nutshell. The overall plot is taken from actual history, not fiction which is always more interesting!!this particular era covers the following reign:  Gaius Octavius born into an old and wealthy equestrian branch of the plebeian Octavii family, in 44 BC he was adopted posthumously by his maternal great-uncle Gaius Julius Caesar following Caesar's assassination. Together with Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus, he formed the Second Triumvirate to defeat the assassins of Caesar. Following their victory at Phillipi, the Triumvirate divided the Roman Republic among themselves and ruled as military dictators.[note 3] The Triumvirate was eventually torn apart under the competing ambitions of its members: Lepidus was driven into exile and stripped of his position, and Antony committed suicide following his defeat at the Battle of Actium by Augustus in 31 BC.The sub-plot revolves around 2 unlikely Roman soldiers whom bond together through circumstances & a shared loyalty to the 13th Legion. In the second and last (unfortunate!!!) season follows our heros as they clash together through a series of (almost humorous) circumstances, only to end in Egypt in order to protect the offspring of Cleopatra & Gaius Julius Caesar against the newly self-proclaimed emperor of the Roman republic (Gaius Octavius) which is run by a handfull of wealthy senators as 98% of the population live in squalor, disease & malnutrion. I dont want to give away the complete plot but it is a well known historical fact the rise & fall of one of the most advanced military civilization occured shortly more or less after the battle of Actium. One theory which I do beleive is that the Roman empire ultimately collapsed due to the then unknown heavy metal (lead) poisining due to widely used pewter cutlery & goblets which to this day is known for its lead toxicity. That being said, the only complaint I have about the 2 short seasons of Rome is that they didnt continue on with another or more season(s)!!!!

I also had a big problem with how boring Vorenus and Pullo's stories were.The second season I believe is a vast improvement over the first.  Pullo and Vorenus, while still dominating half the story, are not as important in the grand scope, and are given a more interesting story.The inaccuracies are still there, but they aren't as blazing as in the first season, such as missing vital characters.The Battle of Philippi sequence is one of the largest and most beautifully done I've ever seen.  Potentially the most accurate battle sequence I've seen in any ancient Roman TV or movie depiction.James Purefoy is perfectly within the role of Antonius, and genuinely shocked me when he put more than just debauchery into his role, showing genuine love and emotion for Cleopatra.  The new actor playing Octavian (Simon Woods) mid-way through the series is much better (and looks more like the actual Octavian), if not a bit cold-hearted in the role.The acting is all over better, with more emotion being delivered by many of the characters, and much more tension, from there being much more on the line if any of the characters should fail.While some episodes suffered from boring bits like the first season, it was more than made up for by the more palpable scenes where you could genuinely feel for the characters, such as Servilia when she stands before Atia's house, calling day and night for justice, or when Pullo discovers just what the maid girl Gaia has done *spoiler alert*My only real disappointment was with the extended ending to the series.  The last episode passed over the Battle of Actium, and focused mostly on Antonius's lollygagging in Alexandria, getting drunk and killing underlings who look at him funny, while spending five or ten minutes hesitating before killing himself rather than be turned over to Octavian for his Triumph.Leaving aside a big list of inaccuracies, I'll just point out the biggest of all.  Since HBO's Rome prides itself with its accurate depiction of the filthy, overpopulated city ""warts and all"", it's only fair that I blast them for their highly stylized and inaccurate depiction of Ptolemaic Alexandria.The ""Antony and Cleopatra"" looking Egyptians with Middle-Kingdom ""The Mummy""-looking attire are highly inaccurate, as is the face makeup typical of cliche' depictions of ancient Egypt.  By this time, Alexandria was completely Greek/Macedonian, and native Egyptians were forbidden to live in Alexandria unless they were slaves---though native Egyptians wouldn't want to live in Alexandria, deeming it a scourge on their country, producing nothing and consuming vast amounts of wheat.  Cleopatra was thoroughly hellenized (Cleopatra is a Greek name, after all) and would only have worn Egyptian garb when visiting the rest of Egypt outside of Alexandria, as she was not simply Queen, but Pharaoh of Egypt, and thus had the love and worship of Alexandrians and Egyptians.All in all, it was a vast improvement from the first season, but like I said in my first season review, it's still just an average series.",4,An improvement from the First...,1179273600,"05 16, 2007",2007,3171,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'review', 'first', 'season', 'know', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'amount', 'inaccuracies', 'also', 'had', 'big', 'problem', 'how', 'boring', 'Vorenus', 'Pullo', 'stories', 'were.The', 'second', 'season', 'believe', 'vast', 'improvement', 'first', 'Pullo', 'Vorenus', 'still', 'dominating', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'important', 'grand', 'scope', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'interesting', 'story.The', 'inaccuracies', 'are', 'still', 'there', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'blazing', 'first', 'season', 'such', 'missing', 'vital', 'characters.The', 'Battle', 'Philippi', 'sequence', 'one', 'largest', 'most', 'beautifully', 'done', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Potentially', 'most', 'accurate', 'battle', 'sequence', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'ancient', 'Roman', 'TV', 'movie', 'depiction.James', 'Purefoy', 'perfectly', 'role', 'Antonius', 'genuinely', 'shocked', 'when', 'put', 'more', 'just', 'debauchery', 'role', 'showing', 'genuine', 'love', 'emotion', 'Cleopatra', 'new', 'actor', 'playing', 'Octavian', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'mid-way', 'series', 'much', 'better', 'more', 'actual', 'Octavian', 'not', 'bit', 'cold-hearted', 'role.The', 'acting', 'better', 'more', 'emotion', 'being', 'delivered', 'many', 'characters', 'much', 'more', 'tension', 'being', 'much', 'more', 'line', 'characters', 'should', 'fail.While', 'episodes', 'suffered', 'boring', 'bits', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'more', 'made', 'up', 'more', 'palpable', 'scenes', 'where', 'could', 'genuinely', 'feel', 'characters', 'such', 'Servilia', 'when', 'Atia', 'house', 'calling', 'day', 'night', 'justice', 'when', 'Pullo', 'just', 'what', 'maid', 'girl', 'Gaia', 'done', '*spoiler', 'only', 'real', 'disappointment', 'was', 'extended', 'ending', 'series', 'last', 'episode', 'passed', 'Battle', 'Actium', 'focused', 'mostly', 'Antonius', 'lollygagging', 'Alexandria', 'getting', 'drunk', 'killing', 'underlings', 'who', 'look', 'funny', 'spending', 'five', 'ten', 'minutes', 'hesitating', 'killing', 'rather', 'be', 'turned', 'Octavian', 'Triumph.Leaving', 'aside', 'big', 'list', 'inaccuracies', ""'ll"", 'just', 'point', 'out', 'biggest', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'accurate', 'depiction', 'filthy', 'overpopulated', 'city', 'warts', 'only', 'fair', 'blast', 'highly', 'stylized', 'inaccurate', 'depiction', 'Ptolemaic', 'Alexandria.The', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'looking', 'Egyptians', 'Middle-Kingdom', 'Mummy', '-looking', 'attire', 'are', 'highly', 'inaccurate', 'face', 'makeup', 'typical', 'cliche', 'depictions', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'time', 'Alexandria', 'was', 'completely', 'Greek/Macedonian', 'native', 'Egyptians', 'were', 'forbidden', 'live', 'Alexandria', 'were', 'slaves', 'native', 'Egyptians', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'live', 'Alexandria', 'deeming', 'scourge', 'country', 'producing', 'nothing', 'consuming', 'vast', 'amounts', 'wheat', 'Cleopatra', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'hellenized', 'Cleopatra', 'Greek', 'name', 'would', 'only', 'have', 'worn', 'Egyptian', 'garb', 'when', 'visiting', 'rest', 'Egypt', 'Alexandria', 'was', 'not', 'simply', 'Queen', 'Pharaoh', 'Egypt', 'thus', 'had', 'love', 'worship', 'Alexandrians', 'Egyptians.All', 'was', 'vast', 'improvement', 'first', 'season', 'said', 'first', 'season', 'review', 'still', 'just', 'average', 'series']",Rome:S2 (DVD)
1070922,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000PGTPH8,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","The second season of HBO's Rome tells the story of Ancient Rome from Caesar's assassination (44 BC) to the suicides of Mark Antony and Cleopatra in the aftermath of the battle of Actium (in 30 BC). While there are several plot threads running through the ten episodes, it is basically about the struggle for power between Octavian (later emperor Augustus) and Mark Antony.The series is centered round the lives of two friends, tough guys and comrades from the campaign in Gaul, Pullo (who is played by Ray Stevenson, who looks a bit like Mel Gibson and another bit like Russell Crowe) and Vorenus (played by Kevin Mckidd, who looks a lot like Daniel Craig). They both existed historically (two centurions bearing those names are mentioned in Caesar's Commentaries on the War in Gaul), but little else is known about them, so most of what is shown in the TV series is invented. The rest of the cast is mostly British, none of them really that famous (most of them come from a BBC high drama/theatrical background) but they mostly acquit themselves fine (James Purefoy particularly excels as the slimy Mark Antony).The production values are fine. Probably because they didn't have an enormous budget, they decided not to film huge crowd scenes (Marc Antony's funeral oration of Caesar is referred to but not shown); overall, the series concentrates on smaller, intimate scenes. I think this decision is wise. However there is a brief recreation of the battle of Philippi, though not of the battle of Actium.With the obvious exception of having the Romans speak in English (there is always something ridiculous about movies where Romans deliver obscenities in a Cockney accent) real care was taken by the filmmakers to make this series as historically accurate as possible.As a nice extra, the DVD features some very good information about different aspects of Ancient Rome to help us understand the series and the era more.",5,A considerable achievement,1325548800,"01 3, 2012",2012,1921,"['second', 'season', 'HBO', 'Rome', 'story', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'Caesar', 'assassination', '44', 'BC', 'suicides', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'aftermath', 'battle', 'Actium', '30', 'BC', 'are', 'several', 'plot', 'threads', 'running', 'ten', 'basically', 'struggle', 'power', 'Octavian', 'later', 'emperor', 'Augustus', 'Mark', 'Antony.The', 'series', 'centered', 'lives', 'two', 'friends', 'tough', 'guys', 'comrades', 'campaign', 'Gaul', 'Pullo', 'who', 'played', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'who', 'bit', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'bit', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'Vorenus', 'played', 'Kevin', 'Mckidd', 'who', 'lot', 'Daniel', 'Craig', 'existed', 'historically', 'two', 'centurions', 'bearing', 'names', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Caesar', 'Commentaries', 'War', 'Gaul', 'little', 'else', 'known', 'so', 'most', 'what', 'shown', 'TV', 'series', 'invented', 'rest', 'cast', 'mostly', 'British', 'none', 'really', 'famous', 'most', 'come', 'BBC', 'high', 'drama/theatrical', 'background', 'mostly', 'acquit', 'fine', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'particularly', 'excels', 'slimy', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'fine', 'Probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'enormous', 'budget', 'decided', 'not', 'film', 'huge', 'crowd', 'scenes', 'Marc', 'Antony', 'funeral', 'oration', 'Caesar', 'referred', 'not', 'shown', 'overall', 'series', 'smaller', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'think', 'decision', 'wise', 'However', 'brief', 'recreation', 'battle', 'Philippi', 'not', 'battle', 'Actium.With', 'obvious', 'exception', 'having', 'Romans', 'speak', 'English', 'always', 'something', 'ridiculous', 'movies', 'where', 'Romans', 'deliver', 'obscenities', 'Cockney', 'accent', 'real', 'care', 'was', 'taken', 'filmmakers', 'make', 'series', 'historically', 'accurate', 'possible.As', 'nice', 'extra', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'information', 'different', 'aspects', 'Ancient', 'Rome', 'help', 'understand', 'series', 'era', 'more']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

So much more story to tell that won't be, with a cast of historical and fictional characters in one of the most exciting and complex societies imaginable, full of intrigue, passion, violence, and humor.  Like the Romans themselves the shows were chock-a-block with seeing, coming and conquering, and the delicious acting and witty scripts are to be savored.  We could wish for more, but at least we have these.The final season centers on the aftermath of Julius Caesar's assassination/murder and the struggle between Brutus, Marc Antony and Octavian within the power vacuum thus created.  James Purefoy's Antony emerges here in all his marvelous contradictions: beloved and often brilliant soldier, careless and licentious hedonist, and finally debauched yet pitiful lover in doomed alliance with Cleopatra.We also have the delicious final battle of wills and scheming between Atia and Sevilia, the rise of the precociously brilliant Octavian, adroit and ruthless, prudish and depraved.  And we have the pursuit and destruction of Caesar's assassins culminating in the epic battle of Phillipa, and the redemptive and, in the end, nobel and courageous death of the tormented and conflicted Brutus.All of the above is  history as presented, again, from the perspective of the Mutt and Jeff of the Roman world, Vorenus and Pullo, the legionaire everymen that allow us to see the underside of Roman history where the common people lived real lives amidst the gutters and and gangsters, shopkeepers and slaves, brothels and bakeries.  Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson are a marvelous duo as the prudish and sternly middle-class Vorenus and the lusty, devil-may-care, yet loyal and true Pullo.I won't cite all the other actors but suffice it to say they are all splendid.  The final season seems a bit rushed and crowded in the final episodes, no doubt because they knew of their cancellation and wanted to wrap up the series as best they could.  I noted storylines that were ready for expansion, and it seemed obvious that the great drama of Antony and Cleopatra versus Ocatavian had to be truncated.  While possibly a little too neat, at least they were allowed to bring the series to a finality (unlike the great Deadwood series, for example).Yes, I am sure Rome was an expensive proposition for HBO to continue.  And I guess it never found the vast audience needed to justify HBO's budget.  But, oh, what a shame! Something this beautifully done deserved a better fate.

1070931,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B000PGTPH8,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[2, 2]","The year is 44 BC. Julius Caesar is dead, assassinated by a cadre of senators led by Brutus and Cassius. The Julii and Caesar's ally Mark Antony prepare to flee, but Caesar's newly-anointed heir Octavian discovers a legal loophole that forces Brutus to agree to a reconciliation. Unfortunately for the conspirators, the popular mood in Rome swings decisively against them and they are forced to flee. When Octavian and Antony are divided by their own disagreements, the scene is set for a devastating three-way civil war which will eventually culminate at Philippi, one of the greatest battles in Roman history.Meanwhile, former centurion-turned-politician Lucius Vorenus has seen his family torn apart by betrayal and treachery. Whilst Titus Pullo tries to save his friend's soul, Vorenus is placed in command of the Aventine Collegia and told to keep the peace between the warring criminal gangs. At the same time, the arrival in Rome of Timon's brother coincides with a rise in Jewish nationalism.Rome's second season picks up at the moment Season 1 ends, with Caesar dead, Vorenus devastated by his loss and the Republic in danger of falling apart into anarchy. Given that the entire storylines for the second and planned third seasons had to be compressed into one season, and only ten episodes at that, the second season moves forward decisively and rapidly. The second season covers a period of fourteen years, and several times multiple years elapse between episodes which makes the season flow slightly less well than the first. In particular, the intrigue between the factions is covered in less depth and Vorenus and Pullo's storyline is to some extent separated from that of the political story, meaning that the Rosencrantz & Guildenstern-like angle from the first season is also diluted although the stories do converge decisively in the final two episodes. Timon's storyline is also given a rather unsatisfactory resolution due to this compression, which is a shame as his 'redemption' from a simple thug in Season 1 into someone with a moral conscience is one of the unsung triumphs of the second year.Despite this haste, the series remains gripping and compelling viewing. Particularly amusing is the way that politics is depicted as one of the forms of entertainment of the day and how the notable unlovable Octavian wins popularity by surrounding himself with a 'next generation' of young, handsome but capable figures such as Agrippa and Maecenas, and arranges a crowd-pleasing marriage to the young, beautiful and intelligent Livia. These new actors fit into the tapestry of the series very well: Simon Woods replaces Max Pirkis to portray the adult Octavian and does a brilliant job portraying the cold, logical future Emperor, Alex Wyndham is excellent as the debauched Maecenas and Alice Henley is clearly relishing playing the twisted Livia. However, Allen Leech has the most challenging role playing the bumbling, well-meaning Agrippa who serves as Octavian's conscience, and hits the right note between Agrippa's somewhat sappy side and his lethal capabilities on the battlefield (Agrippa's military capabilities eclipse those of Antony in very short order, to the latter's fury).Of course, the seasoned actors continue to deliver the goods. James Purefoy (as Antony) graduates from a supporting role in Season 1 to command almost every episode of Season 2 with an impressive, theatrical presence in a gift of a role. Unmentioned in my review of Season 1 was David Bamber as Cicero, whose task is challenging (Cicero was one of the most learned, respected and gifted orators of his generation) but his performance is compelling, especially his concluding scene with Ray Stevenson's Pullo in episode six, which may be the single finest moment in the entire series. Stephenson continues his excellent work as Pullo as the character is put through the wringer but, unlike the first season, manages to keep his head above water and even prosper. However, if Season 2 had a unifying theme it would be the journey through Hades and back of Lucius Vorenus. Kevin McKidd is superb as his character is forced again and again into some very dark decisions.Eventually the dust settles and Rome finishes where it really had to, with Octavian ascending to absolute power with the Senate as little more than his puppet and one of the most famous love stories of all time reaching its tragic ending. Whilst it would have been perhaps more satisfying to see the series go on for longer, it ends brilliantly and the series' relative brevity becomes another one of its strengths.Rome: Season 2 (*****) is a worthy continuation and conclusion to the story begun in the first season. With excellent effects (the Battle of Philippi is impressively depicted) and jaw-dropping set design (the new set of the Aventine Collegia is genuinely amazing in its size and scale) backing up the superlative writing and acting. As with the first season, there is still a lot of violence, swearing, sex and nudity so the series isn't for everyone, but it is well worth watching for those who can accept these elements as part of the narrative.",5,An excellent conclusion to the series,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,5135,"['year', '44', 'BC', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'dead', 'assassinated', 'cadre', 'senators', 'led', 'Brutus',

Having studied Roman history I am aware of the facts, but to see them so faithfully portrayed, at least the bare bones of it, in a work of fiction is absolutely amazing.What is even more amazing is to see how the first season ended, with many of the main characters dead, and see how the second season would pick up and do just as well as the first season.  The drama is powerful, the history is real and potent.  The fictional characters Vorenus and Pullo a real and believable.  The portrayal of not only Rome but of Egypt are so rich in detail that you can't help feel as though you were there.I was heartbroken to see that the series was not to continue for a third season.  It is understandable since costs were prohibitive, but also the fact that they had exhausted and killed off so many characters, remaining faithful to history, that it would be hard to continue on the series from there.  No doubt Augustus Octavian Caesar's reign as emperor would have had enough fuel to power the show on, it is hard to reintroduce so many new characters into the series since, really, only Pullo, Octavian, Octavia and Atia are the only original characters still present.That being said I absolutely love this series and rank this as one of my all time favorite shows to watch.  I was eager to watch each episode, lost for an hour at a time before realizing it, and not the least worried about closure, since each season had closure in and of itself.

1070944,A3K1JFYC9KOVV5,B000PGTPH8,CB,"[3, 3]","If you're like me, you thoroughly enjoyed the first season of Rome, but were also vexed by its numerous inconsistencies and faults - uneven plots and pacing, thin (if not non-existent) character motivations on some occasions, characters (such a Brutus) who didn't seem to have been fully conceptualized, etc. As a result, I must admit, I was hesitant and just a little bit skeptical before I bought this second (and, unfortunately, final) season. However, I must say, I am delighted to report that season 2 of Rome is exceptional, and a vast improvement over the first season.Season 2 picks up immediately (up to the minute) after the end of season 1 as Rome is thrown into turmoil and confusion over the murder of Julius Caesar. Quickly Octavian, Caesar's legal heir, and his old second-in-command, Marc Anthony, butt heads over who is rightful leader of Rome, while Caesar's murderers, Brutus and Cassius, attempt (with some backing in the senate) to raise an army in the east to take Rome by force. Alliences forge and break with dizzying speed and, in the end, Anthony and the Egyptian queen Cleopatra must face Octavian in a showdown for control of the ancient world. On the homefront, the rivaly between the Julii and the Junii (in the forms of Atia and Servilia) comes to a head as never before, and Octavia's relationships with her mother and brother become exceptionally complicated. Octavian himself quickly matures into a cold, calculating, and thoroughly frightening political mover.Everyone's favorite ex-soldiers, Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo, are by no means neglected. Vorenus, due both to events which ended the first season and to those taking place early this season, is a broken man whose vaunted moral compass no longer functions, and must be taken care of by Pullo. Pullo is himself adjusting to life with his ex-slave girlfriend, Aurelli. Under orders from Marc Anthony, Vorenus soon finds himself the crimelord of his entire section of Rome, the Aventine, and Pullo his second-in-command, with brutal results. However, stark reversals of fortune are in store for both.It seems that, in season 2, the sins of the previous season have been exorcised. The unevenness of plotting and the thin character motivations have been rectified to the point that each character has their own crystal clear - if complex - worldview and integrity. Marc Anthony, little more than a drunken, unprincipled bully in the first season, truly comes into his own as a fascinating, brutal and brooding character and delivers the season's standout performance. Brutus, who seemed to suffer from poor writing in season one, emerges as a sympathetic character shocked at the path his life has taken. And we see a new and terrifying side of Vorenus that we only glimpsed in the first season.Other matters are elucidated well also. Octavian, who merely played the politician in the first season, is an eerily apt leader in this season and captivates with his stonefaced transformation from enfant terrible to cold, ruthless tyrant. The love affair between Anthony and Cleopatra is one of the surprise pleasures of the season, depicted as a mad relationship ruled by unruly passions. Other characters who fancied themselves prime movers in the Roman political game now find themselves, in the new political climate, to be merely pawns, and do not wear their new status well.Rome season 2 weaves a complex and highly satisfying tapestry, and proves a fitting end to this exceptional series.

The Senate is in an uproar and the public are infuriated. The collaborators in this devious plot are convinced they have prevented ""the dictator"" from assuming power, but also are disconcerted in the knowledge that their actions are irreversible and may cost them their lives. In his will, Caesar named his nephew Octavian (Max Pirkis) as his heir, bequeathing his power as well as his name to the man he hopes will be the future ruler of the civilized world. Seeing the public outrage is enough to give Anthony the leverage he needs in order to take command of the senate, and offer them a tempestuous deal. He will make certain the masses do not riot and slaughter the senators, so long as they grant him power.With the wife of Lucius Vorenous (Kevin McKidd) lying dead at the foot of the stairs where she flung herself in a suicidal rage, his children have returned from the market and believe he has murdered their mother. Vonrenus is still in the midst of a blood feud with a local slave lord and when his children go missing, is horrified and infuriated to learn that they have been brutally killed. Together with his best friend Pullo (Ray Stevenson), he slaughters those responsible and then throws himself into soldiering in the hope of forgetting the past. Little does he know that his children are live in a slave caravan, nor that they continue to harbor feelings of hatred toward his ruthless former actions.Many fans found the second season of Rome to be far inferior to the first, and I must agree with them. The plight of the everyday man in this season seems much more boring and less intricate in the first. The first season did not have a huge amount of minor characters, but this time around we're forced to be preoccupied with the life of one of Atia's servants, whom she often hires for cruel punishments that involve torture or murder. He is a Jew and much time is devoted to the arrival of his brother from Jerusalem, and his attempts to persuade him to give up his Roman lifestyle for one more ""pure."" I didn't like the man in the first season, and had no interest in him in the second, so that subplot bored me. The series does not become truly fascinating, in fact, until the last couple of episodes, when Marc Anthony takes up residence in Alexandria with Cleopatra, although it does have the added benefit of a grown-up Octavian (Kerry Condon) outsmarting everyone as he steadily takes power.Given that Augustus was known for his impossible standards of morality, I find it hard to believe that he and this vicious and often twisted boy are one and the same. There's something creepy about him, especially when he informs the girl who is to be his wife that he will have to beat her sometimes, not because she has been bad, but because it ""gives him pleasure."" Rome also has an immense amount of sexuality and nudity that at times are downright distracting from its plot.

It is more manly, no question there. The sex, often times arriving in orgy style, borders on pornographic, as does the violence. All the better for you and me. This season really did amp up the debauchery, turning Rome into a mecca for sinful pleasures. But to say that it is BETTER than ""Sex and the City"" is simply not true. The story is too huge to control and thus the relationship the writers have with their audience is watered down. The politics are somewhat tough to follow, this army, that army, what's the difference? Time speeds up then slows down. But still the show was decent while it lasted and finished strong. So strong in fact that I am sad to see it go as I was really hoping they could keep the game going long enough to examine Caligula.My limited reading of post-Julius Caesar Rome (I was a history major after all) led me to believe that simply getting a handle on the politics was a daunting task, and I still feel that way to a degree. But this season piqued my interest in the real Roman history in a way that season 1 never did. Now I feel anxious to dive back into the books as I at least have a basic outline of events. At the heart of the season is the rise of Octavian into the ruler of Rome. Early on he is played by Max Pirkis and is very tough to take seriously because he looks just like Doogie Howser. He grows up to be played by Simon Woods who nails the role so well that he will probably always own the part (that goes for Lyndsey Marshal as Cleopatra as well). Woods knows that it is not enough to just be ruthless as that was only one aspect of Octavian's personality, so he fills out with the role with creepiness, repression, paranoia, and sickness. We also follow Mark Anthony on his colonial expedition to Egypt, the continued war between Atia and Servilia, and the surprisingly tender relationship between Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo.One thing this season does so well that the previous season lacked is the ability to draw parallels between our empire and the Roman one. Sure, sometimes it looks strained such as when it gets up on its soapbox to proclaim that feminism is good and drugs are bad. But abortion, distrust of the state sponsored media, and marriage of convenience also thrives there and by exploring them they breathe new life into the series. It still maintains its old school edge in scenes such as the one where Lucius chokes the life out of his daughter, but just like Alec Baldwin's daughter she totally had it coming. For me season 1 was little more than the producers relying on sets and costumes and the hope that you paid attention in history class, but season 2 has much more to offer. A stronger story, great acting (that is projected a little too loudly), and a much more interesting history lesson. And for those of you in it for more selfish reasons, the girls are much more willing to show their pink bits this time around.",3,More Fun Than a Book,1180828800,"06 3, 2007",2007,3042,"['have', 'male', 'friends', 'who', 'will', 'rip', 'chest', 'hair', 'out', 'telling', 'how', 'much', 'better', 'show', 'HBO', 'golden', 'oldie', 'Sex', 'City', 'more', 'manly', 'question', 'there', 'sex', 'often', 'arriving', 'orgy', 'style', 'borders', 'pornographic', 'violence', 'better', 'season', 'really', 'did', 'amp', 'up', 'debauchery', 'turning', 'Rome', 'mecca', 'sinful', 'pleasures', 'say', 'BETTER', 'Sex', 'City', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'story', 'too', 'huge', 'control', 'thus', 'relationship', 'writers', 'have', 'audience', 'watered', 'down', 'politics', 'are', 'somewhat', 'tough', 'follow', 'army', 'what', 'difference', 'Time', 'up', 'then', 'down', 'still', 'show', 'was', 'decent', 'lasted', 'finished', 'strong', 'So', 'strong', 'fact', 'am', 'sad', 'see', 'go', 'was', 'really', 'hoping', 'could', 'keep', 'game', 'going', 'long', 'enough', 'examine', 'Caligula.My', 'limited', 'reading', 'post-Julius', 'Caesar', 'Rome', 'was', 'history', 'major', 'led', 'believe', 'simply', 'getting', 'handle', 'politics', 'was', 'daunting', 'task', 'still', 'feel', 'way', 'degree', 'season', 'piqued', 'interest', 'real', 'Roman', 'history', 'way', 'season', '1', 'never', 'did', 'Now', 'feel', 'anxious', 'dive', 'back', 'books', 'least', 'have', 'basic', 'outline', 'events', 'heart', 'season', 'rise', 'Octavian', 'ruler', 'Rome', 'Early', 'played', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'very', 'tough', 'take', 'seriously', 'just', 'like', 'Doogie', 'Howser', 'up', 'be', 'played', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'who', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'will', 'probably', 'always', 'own', 'part', 'Lyndsey', 'Marshal', 'as', 'Cleopatra', 'well', 'Woods', 'not', 'enough', 'just', 'be', 'ruthless', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'aspect', 'Octavian', 'personality', 'out', 'role', 'creepiness', 'repression', 'paranoia', 'sickness', 'also', 'follow', 'Mark', 'Anthony', 'colonial', 'expedition', 'Egypt', 'continued', 'war', 'Atia', 'Servilia', 'surprisingly', 'tender', 'relationship', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'Titus', 'Pullo.One', 'thing', 'season', 'so', 'well', 'previous', 'season', 'lacked', 'ability', 'draw', 'parallels', 'empire', 'Roman', 'one', 'Sure', 'strained', 'such', 'when', 'up', 'soapbox', 'proclaim', 'feminism', 'good', 'drugs', 'are', 'bad', 'abortion', 'distrust', 'state', 'sponsored', 'media', 'marriage', 'convenience', 'also', 'there', 'exploring', 'breathe', 'new', 'life', 'series', 'still', 'old', 'school', 'edge', 'scenes', 'such', 'one', 'where', 'Lucius', 'life', 'daughter', 'just', 'Alec', 'Baldwin', 'daughter', 'totally', 'had', 'coming', 'season', '1', 'was', 'little', 'more', 'producers', 'relying', 'sets', 'costumes', 'hope', 'paid', 'attention', 'history', 'class', 'season', '2', 'much', 'more', 'offer', 'A', 'stronger', 'story', 'great', 'acting', 'projected', 'little', 'too', 'loudly', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'history', 'lesson', 'more', 'selfish', 'reasons', 'girls', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'willing', 'show', 'pink', 'time', 'around']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

Historical purists will probably quibble with some of the elements of the show, although I would like to point out that A - at least they tried very hard to base the plot on historical text, B - the historical texts of the period are sometimes vague and conflicting and C - the show's producers nailed Roman culture and thinking of the late republic dead on.  (As one of the commentaries mentions, historians might not like this show, but classicists do).  There is also a subtle but strong morality discussion running through the entire series (this review title comes from a short dialogue between Cleopatra and Pullo, which comes close to summing up the series in a sentence)This is a hard show to stop watching once you start.  There are not a ton of DVD extras, the commentaries are OK, the ""All Roads Lead to Rome"" feature is nice, and there are a few featurettes of varying quality.  Mostly, you should get this DVD so you can plow through the whole thing in a week!This is probably a no-brainer for most Amazon readers, but please please please watch season one first - the Atia/Octavian/Octavia relationship and the Pullo/Vorenus duo is much more interesting to watch.",5,"""Is he a good man?""

Well, there are very few surviving contemporary accounts, and those focus on elites and major events. Even ""serious"" historians admit there's a lot of guesswork involved in ancient history, and many of the contemporary sources are full of bias and errors. So, the producers had to fill in the gaps with creativity. The general themes are accurate, the sets are spectacular, and a lot of attention is paid to fascinating details about religious beliefs, diet, housing, and the Roman political system. The DVD set has audio commentaries by the historian Jonathan Stamp and episodes can be viewed with pop-ups that specifically address historical issues. HBO did its homework here, and the series is a successful balance of modern entertainment and history.Before watching this series I viewed people like Pompey, Julius Caesar, Cicero, Octavian (Augustus Caesar), Mark Antony, and the others as something like walking statues. This series made these people come alive. And what a lusty, lively lot they were.Having seen both seasons, I would have to rank the first clearly above the second, but they both get solid fives. The acting is powerful. Atia, Pullo, and Gaia (Pullo's slave/lover) stand out.Too bad the fun ended after the second season with the aftermath of Actium. I would like to see this crew put its spin on such topics as the life of Christ, Nero, the end of the Roman Empire in the West, and later historical developments as well.

We've heard it all before - except, of course, we haven't heard it quite told this way.  The boy Octavian, always a sharp young cookie, becomes a wiley young man.  Antony, in his infamous affair with Cleopatra, is a harrowing illustration of how a man can fall so far, so fast.  The ugly war between  Servilla and Attia comes to an ugly end, as you supposed it would (although Attia slowly becomes a sympathetic figure), and Attia's lapdog, Timon, finally gets religion and goes home to Judea.  As always, though, the central figures of Vorenius and Pullo are at the forefront of our memories. After the suicide of his wife, Vorenius' homelife goes from bad to much worse before it finally resolves itself, and Pullo has to lose his own beloved wife before his head is freed to help Vorenius resue Cleopatra's son - supposedly Caesar's son, but who is in fact Pullo's!

I'm a bit nervous for season three, where many series such as ""House"" have lost their way. I hope ROME continues strong and well-written. Due to the fact it is based upon history, perhaps the writers won't lose their way after all.The only criticism that can be leveled against the show is that it is ultraviolent, with more bodies per hour than ""Sopranos."" However, that's the way Rome was. This season covers the triumph of Augustus over Mark Antony, a period that was relatively peaceful, compared to the horrible times that followed with Caligula and the like. And anyway, the violence to a large extent explains our fascination with the Roman Empire. Are we superior to the crowds that gathered in the coliseum?One reason to watch ROME is that it provokes philosophical questions. Is Augustus right to act as he does? Is Mark Antony? What about the slaves and the deeds that they do? Another reason to watch ROME is to compare the modern nations to this ancient one, and have the truth sink in to our cynical bones that THIS is the BEST of all times of man. Continually we hear opinion columnists bemoan modern times, and those fond of religion like to imagine that the Apocalypse approaches. At least neither you nor I are likely to be put into slavery, have our property seized by the state, or any other unpleasant outcome.

In fact, looking back, those films were often quite cheesy. Hollywood stopped making movies about ancient Rome for a long while, untilGladiatorcame out in 2000. As a movie,Gladiatorwas awesome and showed a vastly more realistic yet grander Rome than ever before seen in Hollywood. Yet, as history, the movie had its flaws (most notably that it distorted the historical record quite bit). However, I'd despaired that it would be the pinnacle of our ability to visualize Rome.I was pleasantly surprised to find that HBO did an excellent job at recreating the ancient Roman empire in its miniseriesRome. At first, I was suspicious, worried that Rome would become twisted by HBO, the same creators ofSex and the City. Yet, the series is awesome. In terms of the production quality, it looks and feels like a big budget movie (indeed, the cost of the series eventually doomed it). The acting, visual effects, and soundtrack are exceptional (be sure to get Jeff Beal's soundtrackRome: Music from the HBO Series).HBO also took care to portray Rome in a somewhat historically accurate fashion. HBO hired expert historians and consultants for every detail. Unlike most movies about ancient Rome, HBO did not shy away from portraying the less glamorous sides of Rome. In fact, much of the series deals with everyday citizens, from prostitutes to roving gangs. This in turn means that the series includes a lot of explicit sex and violence. While this means the series isn't appropriate for kids or the faint of heart, it does mean thatRomeshows Rome as it actually was.One thing I love about this series is that it deals with the last years of the Roman Republic, one of the most compelling eras in history. Most movies and TV shows shy away from historically important events, but HBO tackles it with gusto. The show manages to remain historically accurate while using actual historical to provide the drama in the show. HBO did a great job finding actors to portray Julius Caesar, Pompey, Mark Antony, Cato, and the rest of the dramatis personae (although I wasn't as pleased with their choices for the Augustus side of the family - see below). At times, you almost feel like you traveled back in a time machine to witness these epic events. If you're interested in this period, I'd recommend Tom Holland'sRubicon: The Last Years of the Roman Republicfor more depth on events during the period. I only wish the series had been longer rather than only two seasons - it would have great to have seen the Battle of the Teutoberg Forest in 9 AD, or the end of Augustus' reign. However, apparently the budget for the show grew so large that HBO (foolishly) decided to cancel it.My only criticism of the show is the portrayal of Augustus and his mother, Atia (Polly Walker). Historians don't necessarily have accurate information on the personalities of these figures, and there probably isn't a ""definitive"" interpretation of their lives. Still, I thought the show took a few too many liberties. While Atia in real life was probably cunning and ambitious, Polly Walker's version of Atia makes her into a psychotic and sadistic woman. In one scene, she even has a torture room and tortures Servilla. There's no historical basis for any of that, and it does seem a bit outlandish. For his part, Augustus as played by Simon Woods seemed a bit too dull and cynical. Again, while I'm sure Augustus must have had excellent political acumen to rise so high, he was also a brilliant administrator and did have a vision for Rome. I just didn't think HBO's depiction of either character stood up well or resembled what I had read in Anthony Everitt's excellentAugustus: The Life of Rome's First Emperor.A quick note about the DVDs themselves. They are excellent quality and include hours of bonus materials, including deleted scenes and ""making of"" featurettes.

1070983,AAIL33CYCT47J,B000PGTPH8,Gregory Baird,"[5, 5]","At the onset of the second season of ""Rome"" there are a lot of plot points to tie up.  Gaius Julius Caesar is dead.  Lucius Vorenus has lost his beloved wife and his children blame him for their mother's death.  The bitter feud between Attia and Servilia is raging worse than ever, and the future of Rome's glorious reign of power is uncertain.  Brutus and Cicero must legitimize their actions to the public in order to sieze control of the government, but Mark Antony refuses to back down without a fight.  Further complicating matters is moody young Octavian, Caesar's rightful heir, who eventually throws his hat in the ring to claim the throne that he craves so desperately.But it's not just politics at the forefront of ""Rome"" -- the true genius of the show is in its deeply resonant characters and the complexities of their ever-changing relationships as they careen through an historic and bloody time period.  On this more personal level, Lucius Vorenus must work to rebuild his life and regain the trust of his children with the help of his loyal buddy, Titus Pullo (whose love life is more complicated than ever what with his beautiful wife Eirene plus the arrival of a lusty slave who pursues him with a fierce determination).  Meanwhile, Octavian's decision to take full advantage of his inheritance puts quite the strain on his mother's relationship with Mark Antony, who is quite beguiled by Cleopatra after he lands in Egypt toward the end of the season (!).I'll say nothing more of the plot for fear of giving anything away; just be assured that everything you loved about season one is present and accounted for: ample sex and violence (plus copius nude scenes from a lot of good looking actors and actresses), drama, intrigue, comedy, and impeccable craftsmanship.  ""Rome"" is one of those rare products where every element comes together perfectly -- cinematography, costuming, make-up, writing, directing, and especially the acting.  ""Rome"" features the most talented (and most criminally underrated) cast in television, from bit players to principles there isn't a wrong note to be found.  I had been nervous that season 2 might falter without the magnetism of Ciaran Hinds' spectacular Caesar, but all of the other actors raise their game to fill in the void.  James Purefoy amps up Antony's egotism to tragic hero levels; Ray Stevenson and Kevin McKidd perfect their already stellar chemistry as buddies-for-life Pullo and Vorenus; Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Lyndsey Marshal and David Bamber steal more than their fair share of scenes as Octavia, Brutus, a petulant Cleopatra, and Cicero respectively; and Polly Walker and Lindsay Duncan positively smolder as they play out their wicked feud as Attia and Servilia (Walker's final moments in the finale are so delicious that she nearly steals the entire season out from under everyone else's feet).So what are you waiting for?  To watch an episode of ""Rome"" is to be absolutely hooked, so if you've already indulged in Rome - The Complete First Season you need to follow the series through to its awe-inspiring climax.  It's a journey well worth your time and money.Grade: A+",5,The Spectacular Conclusion to an Amazing Series,1189814400,"09 15, 2007",2007,3149,"['onset', 'second', 'season', 'Rome', 'are', 'lot', 'plot', 'points', 'tie', 'up', 'Gaius', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'dead', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'lost', 'beloved', 'wife', 'children', 'blame', 'mother', 'death', 'bitter', 'feud', 'Attia', 'Servilia', 'raging', 'worse', 'ever', 'future', 'Rome', 'glorious', 'reign', 'power', 'uncertain', 'Brutus', 'Cicero', 'must', 'legitimize', 'actions', 'public', 'order', 'sieze', 'control', 'government', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'back', 'down', 'fight', 'Further', 'complicating', 'matters', 'moody', 'young', 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'rightful', 'heir', 'who', 'eventually', 'hat', 'ring', 'claim', 'throne', 'so', 'desperately.But', 'not', 'just', 'politics', 'forefront', 'Rome', 'true', 'genius', 'show', 'deeply', 'resonant', 'characters', 'complexities', 'ever-changing', 'relationships', 'careen', 'historic', 'bloody', 'time', 'period', 'more', 'personal', 'level', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'must', 'work', 'rebuild', 'life', 'regain', 'trust', 'children', 'help', 'loyal', 'buddy', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'love', 'life', 'more', 'complicated', 'ever', 'what', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'Eirene', 'arrival', 'lusty', 'slave', 'who', 'fierce', 'determination', 'Meanwhile', 'Octavian', 'decision', 'take', 'full', 'advantage', 'inheritance', 'quite', 'strain', 'mother', 'relationship', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'who', 'quite', 'beguiled', 'Cleopatra', 'Egypt', 'end', 'season', '.I', ""'ll"", 'say', 'nothing', 'more', 'plot', 'fear', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'just', 'be', 'assured', 'everything', 'loved', 'season', 'one', 'present', 'accounted', 'ample', 'sex', 'violence', 'copius', 'nude', 'scenes', 'lot', 'good', 'looking', 'actors', 'actresses', 'drama', 'intrigue', 'comedy', 'impeccable', 'craftsmanship', 'Rome', 'one', 'rare', 'products', 'where', 'element', 'together', 'perfectly', 'cinematography', 'costuming', 'make-up', 'writing', 'directing', 'especially', 'acting', 'Rome', 'most', 'talented', 'most', 'criminally', 'underrated', 'cast', 'television', 'bit', 'players', 'principles', ""n't"", 'wrong', 'note', 'be', 'found', 'had', 'been', 'nervous', 'season', '2', 'might', 'falter', 'magnetism', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'spectacular', 'Caesar', 'other', 'actors', 'raise', 'game', 'fill', 'void', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'up', 'Antony', 'egotism', 'tragic', 'hero', 'levels', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'perfect', 'already', 'stellar', 'chemistry', 'buddies-for-life', 'Pullo', 'Vorenus', 'Kerry', 'Condon', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'Lyndsey', 'Marshal', 'David', 'Bamber', 'steal', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'scenes', 'Octavia', 'Brutus', 'petulant', 'Cleopatra', 'Cicero', 'respectively', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'positively', 'smolder', 'play', 'out', 'wicked', 'feud', 'Attia', 'Servilia', 'Walker', 'final', 'moments', 'finale', 'are', 'so', 'delicious', 'nearly', 'steals', 'entire', 'season', 'everyone', 'else', 'feet', '.So', 'what', 'are', 'waiting', 'watch', 'episode', 'Rome', 'be', 'absolutely', 'hooked', 'so', ""'ve"", 'already', 'indulged', 'Rome', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'need', 'follow', 'series', 'awe-inspiring', 'climax', 'journey', 'well', 'time', 'money.Grade', 'A+']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

There were historical inaccuracies in Season I, but there are many more in Season II; the only one of which I can remember is that the conspirators planned to throw Caesar's body into the Tiber, but their fear of Antony and the populace made them give over this course of action. I pretty much enjoyed Season II with a few caveats: I. The actress who played Cleopatra was too whiny in my opinion; history says that Cleopatra was a strong woman, with an aptitude for politicsm of which there was barely any sign here, II. The producers changed the actor who plays Octavian, but not the actress who plays Octavia. Didn't Octavia also grow older? If so, it didn't show. (Side note: I liked their relationship before Octavian left in the aftermath of his uncle's assassination). III. A historical fact is ret-conned towards the middle/end of the series finale, for dramatic purposes, but still...you really shouldn't screw up history for the sake of entertainment.

1070990,ANEZJYKUDNJYQ,B000PGTPH8,Jack Rice,"[3, 3]","Ignore the pedants who complain about historical ""inaccuracies"". Nonsense!  You can count the primary historical sources for the period on one hand, and all the commentators of the era, from Caesar to Cicero to Suetonius to Tacitus, to Sallust to Livy, had axes to grind.  Jonathan Stamp, the historical consultant and co-producer, is a first-rate scholar and not window dressing.  He's forgotten more about Roman history than those who complain here will ever know.  There are huge and deep gaps in Roman history.  The series fills in the gaps.  This is the functon of historical fiction.The claimed ""inaccuracies"" are no more than disagreement with other speculations.  For example, the nonsense about Atia:  Tacitus says some nice things about her and Suetonius makes up some silly legend about omens.  Silly people call this ""history"".  Maybe she was virtuous, but there's no hard evidence one way or another, and the producers can portray her to suit. As it happens, Rome's Atia, like I Claudius' similarly ""enhanced"" Livia, is a delicious and, given her culture, thoroughly believable character.You can take the characters and events of Rome at face value, and you will be far ahead of the pack in knowledge of the period.I was sorry to see Max Pirkis's wonderful boy Octavian replaced by Simon Woods' Octavian Caesar, but time goes on, and, like Pirkis, Woods makes a chilling future Augustus.As in the first season, the second season illuminates the the way the different strata of Roman society meet common life situations, from career to marital to moral issues.  Sometimes the strata converge by circumstance, as the characters of Rome encounter each other, usually briefly.  But upward mobility is a deadly game in Rome, and those who play the game, on whatever level, inevitably pay the price.I wish HBO had decided to make Rome an ongoing series, for what comes after Augustus is, as we know, just as exciting, sordid, and suspensful as the story of Caesar and Augustus. Maybe out of respect we could hop over I Claudius and continue with the so-called Good Emperors or the Barracks Emperors.  Trajan or Hadrian -- now, these are stories.  Or Marcus Aurelius, the philisopher emperor who persecuted the Christians.  Now, why did he do that?  I'd love Stamp's speculations.  Or later on, how about Constantine?  Nothing ever produced about him, and yet his story is perhaps most exciting of them all -- his outmaneuvering his co-emperors, his weird personal life -- his murder of his wife and son -- his thing with Christianity, his building up of Byzantium, later Constantinople...  Think of what Messrs. Heller, Milius, Apted, these great movie-makers, together with the resources of HBO and BBC, could do with that!I know there's lots of partisanship about the different HBO series.  Many have run far longer than Rome has.  This isn't because of quality but because Rome is probably the most expensive series HBO ever mounted.  Sorry, Sopranos fanboys and girls, ditto Deadwood and, um, Carnivale...  Soap operas about sleazy gangsters have their allure, as do ""real westerns"" and supernatural circuses.

1070996,A331WJPUGHRWIH,B000PGTPH8,James Mace,"[16, 17]","This review covers both seasons of ""Rome,"" so please excuse the long read, as well as any redundancy.First off I have to say that I absolutely loved this series, and I so wanted to give it five stars. However, there are some rather significant historical caveats that force me to give it only four (in all honesty I'd give it four and a half if that were possible). What I appreciate is that the creators acknowledged where they deviated from history, and that their intent was to create an accurate ""feel"" for what life in Rome was like for all social classes. In this regard they excelled; filming in Rome itself and casting actual Romans as extras was genius. One gets to see how the Noble Romans, plebeians, and even slaves lived. I got a real feel as to how the social orders interacted with each other, and just how human life was valued (or in many cases devalued).The real issue I had with the series is that some characters were well overplayed, while others of great historical significance were either underplayed, or else left out completely. Foremost I thought that Octavian's mother Atia was way overdone and by far the most dramatized. The show's creators even admitted that the woman portrayed in the series bore little, if any, resemblance to the historical Atia Balba. In fact, she was said to be more inspired by Mark Antony's notoriously scheming wife Fulvia, who is completely absent from the series. I also felt that they tried to portray Atia similarly (albeit probably inadvertently) to Livia's portrayal in the Masterpiece Theater series, ""I, Claudius."" Of course I was then surprised when we do get to see Livia in ""Rome,"" as she comes across as quite meek and unassuming. That aside, my biggest complaint with so much time being devoted to Atia's character, at the expense of others, is the fact that historically Atia Balba died in 43 B.C., just 18 months after Julius Caesar. She had been dead for more than a decade by the time of Octavian's victory over Antony and Cleopatra. On the other hand, Atia's second husband, Lucius Marcius Phillipus was alive and well and in fact played a very important role as one of his stepson's advisors until well after Octavian's rise to Emperor. Phillipus is never mentioned in the series. Of those neglected, I felt the most significant was Marcus Agrippa. The historical Agrippa was a decisive military genius, both on land and sea. His character comes across as rather awkward, and it is only in passing that he was the one who defeated Antony at Actium. There is also no historical basis for his affair with Octavian's sister, Octavia; though it is interesting to note that Agrippa did in fact later marry Octavian's daughter, Julia.The other issue that may come across as confusing is the perceived time between events, and the lack of aging in most characters. In Series One, Vorenus' eldest daughter is shown to be roughly the same age as Octavian. While actors change to account of Octavian's age, the same actress plays Vorena throughout the series. She is still seen as a young teen at the end of the series, even though she would actually be in her early thirties. Lucius and Vorena the Younger would both be in their twenties; much older than they are shown. Caesarian is also shown to still be a young boy, when historically he was seventeen when Antony and Cleopatra were defeated. Events (particularly in Season Two) give the appearance of taking no more than a few years to complete. Octavian acknowledges his age being nineteen when he petitions for the Consul's chair, and one feels that he's little older at the series' end; when in fact Octavian was thirty-two by the time the Battle of Actium took place. Twenty-one years from the series beginning to end does little to age any of the characters.Make no mistake, these complaints I have do not take away from the overall ""feel"" of the story. ""Rome"" is still one of my all-time favorite series, and I highly recommend it! As an author of historical novels myself, I felt the need to point out where this series dramatized certain characters and events, so that the viewer knows what is real and what is not. Ironically, what is real is often more far-fetched sounding than what is not. The only other thing that was regrettable, though understandable, was the lack of battle scenes. I had hoped to see how this show would recreate the Battle of Actium. However, given the series' already astronomical costs, it is understandable that battles were kept to a minimum. I will say that the ones they did show were probably the most accurate portrayals of legionary close-combat ever shown on film. The battle formations and tactics were correct, to include the ""passage-of-lines"" where Roman soldiers in subsequent ranks blitz forward to relieve those on the front line every few minutes. Armor and uniforms were also correct for the time period. If one looks closely, you will also see the evolution of legionary armor; throughout most of the series they are accurately shown wearing mail, yet towards the end Octavian's soldiers are depicted wearing the more famous segmented plate armor (commonly referred to as the lorica segmentata). The one tactic I have yet to see though is the ""javelin storm"" that the Roman legions would unleash just before closing with their enemy; however, I do not know if this was a common tactic during this time frame or if it became more used during the early Empire.Of interesting note: Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo were based on real people; both are mentioned in Caesar's Gallic Commentaries. The difference being that historically both men were First Cohort Centurions, not just Vorenus. Both men were also part of Legion XI, not Legion XIII. The account of Pullo, and subsequently Vorenus, charging the Nervii alone is partially correct. Caesar's account gives the impression that the men were friends who shared a rivalry and tried to outdo each other in individual feats of valor. Their depictions after the Gallic Wars are entirely fictionalized.In the end, ""Rome"" is one of, if not the best series ever compiled about the Roman Republic / Empire. I hope that fans of this series will be drawn into reading about the historical personas of those portrayed on film. ""Rome"" gives the viewer a breathtaking visual foundation with which they can build upon by further reading. On that note, the violence and sexual encounters (of which there are plenty) in this series are extremely graphic, yet one gets the feel that they are this way for authenticity, rather than ""shock value."" Anyone with even a passing interest in Roman history needs to watch this series.",4,"Outstanding Series, I WISH I could have given it five stars!",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,6634,"['review',

1070997,A1HDQMD058B644,B000PGTPH8,"James Q. Smith ""JQS""","[0, 0]","This review isn't about the HBO series content, which many others have already reviewed, but of the blu-ray version versus all the previous versions I've seen: cable, DVD and streaming Netflix and Hulu.  Rome by HBO was among, or, the first show, to depict a more thorough vision of Roman life given what we know archeologically about them in by year 2000.  Its not meant to be true history, but rather fiction set in the time period of Julius Caesar.When this series first aired on 2005/6, the US still used analog NTSC and that was how I first saw Rome, and many times after.  Netflix only sent out DVDs, which was the best their was, 480p. Blu-ray and the succeeding format war with HD-DVD not yet been happened.Since then, we now have streaming Netflix or Hulu but its typically 720p and if 1080p is heavily compressed.  The latter HDTV formats are a striking improvement in quality: you can best appreciate the quality and texture of the clothing, the sets, the chain mail and metals on the helmets and uniforms, and much easily detect a CGI rendition over a set or a live outdoor setting.  The sets used in Rome are very well done, as unlike the movie Troy, they appear more realistic for depiction of period materials: planks of unfinished lumber, concrete, paints using crude pigments, cloth woven with large yarn and much more.  Back in 2005/6, the lack of detail provided by NTSC and DVD made all the texture of materials blurred or smoothen, but are now tack sharp.  Naturally, the actors look more realistic, with better color and sharpness to facial features, skin tones and makeup that doesn't look fake, particularly the blood and wounds on the actors.That said, the blu-ray release in 2011 of this series blows all the prior formats and streaming, away.  Blu-ray movies are optimized for best 1080p video and audio, and the impact is immediate.  The 1080p colors are deeper, richer, the sharpness and detail are stunningly better than the best stream I've seen and one can easily compare side by side with streaming video.

Control of the Empire is torn between Brutus and Caesar's great nephew Octavian and his right hand man Mark Antony.  Seductress Atia is torn between the two - she is mother of Octavian and mistress to Antony.  Atia is also involved in an escalating rivalry with Servilia, the wife of Julius Caesar.This season also deals with the domestication of Lucius Vorenus - his transition from officer in Caesar's legion to local politician.  Noble Vorenus spends much of this season estranged from his family for reasons I won't spoil here, but his character arc is one of the most satisfying of the show.  We're also treated to the ""whatever it takes"" actions of Titus Pullo, the former foot-soldier.  Pullo is a barbaric brute, but also with compassion and the ability to learn and become more humane and educated.An historic sub-plot occurs in Egypt where Antony and Cleopatra lounge in hazed bliss.

1071033,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B000PGTPH8,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[139, 157]","Rome. Once the center of power for most of Europe, the coast of North Africa and portions of the Middle East for several centuries until its collapse in 476 C.E., continues to leave its mark on the modern world; but what of the people that lived there when Rome ceased being a Republic beginning in 48 B.C.E. to become, instead, the empire that ruled for over 5 centuries? Yes, we have studied their surviving writings, their surviving buildings & infrastructure, as well as their impact upon societies; but as individuals who lived their lives there from day to day, few have grasped what their lives may have been like.  Yes, there have been various films, such as ""Spartacus"" (1960) and various films that focused more on Christian themes within the Roman Empire; but these films typically portray Romans negatively rather than focusing on the Romans themselves and their lives in the capital.In 2005, a new television series aired on HBO with the simple name ""Rome"".  It's second season continued in 2007.  Unlike past negative portrayals of ancient Rome, this fictional series (based on factual events) focuses on the lives of various individuals, including Julius Caesar's former mistress Servilia (Lindsay Duncan); the power-hungry Atia (Polly Walker), who was related to Caesar; Atia's son Gaius Octavian (Max Pirkis as a teenager, Simon Woods as a young man); Octavian's friend & general Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (Allen Leech), who falls in love with Octavian's sister Octavia (Kerry Condon); Mark Antony (James Purefoy), who is forced to marry Octavia to keep peace with Octavian; Servilia's son Marcus Junius Brutus (Tobias Menzies); Cleopatra (Lyndsey Marshal); Senator Marcus Tullius Cicero (David Bamber); and two Roman soldiers: Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) and Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson).  Lucius Veronus, still the tragic character wanted only to provide for his wife Niobe (Indira Varma), who died in the first season, and their children, who were enslaved.  Having served in the military under Mark Antony and briefly as a senator, he is given control over Rome's commercial district, but eventually rejoins the army after being rejected by his children (after rescuing them from slavery) and follows Mark Antony to Egypt.  Lucius Veronus often helps his less educated friend Titus Pullo, who has a huge temper and often uses physical aggression as a means to solve disputes.  Servilia, after being spurned by Julius Caesar in the first season and encouraged her son Brutus to murder him, must instead mourn Brutus' eventual death.  For, it was after Caesar's death, that Octavian is declared his son and heir, which he takes rather seriously to the chagrin of Mark Antony and Atia, his lover.  Atia (highly fictionalized in the series), still the egocentric and wanton manipulator, becomes very attached to Mark Antony; but that relationship is not to last, which may fulfill a curse from her bitter enemy Servilia.With frequent sexual intrigue and nudity, ""Rome"" is a series that will never be seen on network television; but it did find a very good home on HBO.  With its very interesting portrayal of life in ancient Rome from many perspectives, wonderful dialog, brilliant acting, beautiful cinematography and engaging characters, I rate ""Rome-The Complete Second Season"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",5,The Incredible Series Exploring Lives in Ancient Rome Continues,1179792000,"05 22, 2007",2007,3357,"['Rome', 'Once', 'center', 'power', 'most', 'Europe', 'coast', 'North', 'Africa', 'portions', 'Middle', 'East', 'several', 'centuries', 'collapse', '476', 'C.E.', 'leave', 'mark', 'modern', 'world', 'what', 'people', 'lived', 'when', 'Rome', 'ceased', 'being', 'Republic', 'beginning', '48', 'B.C.E', 'become', 'instead', 'empire', 'ruled', '5', 'centuries', 'Yes', 'have', 'studied', 'surviving', 'writings', 'surviving', 'buildings', 'infrastructure', 'as', 'well', 'impact', 'societies', 'individuals', 'who', 'lived', 'lives', 'there', 'day', 'day', 'few', 'have', 'grasped', 'what', 'lives', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'Yes', 'have', 'been', 'various', 'films', 'such', 'Spartacus', '1960', 'various', 'films', 'focused', 'more', 'Christian', 'themes', 'Roman', 'Empire', 'films', 'typically', 'portray', 'Romans', 'negatively', 'rather', 'focusing', 'Romans', 'lives', 'capital.In', '2005', 'new', 'television', 'series', 'aired', 'HBO', 'simple', 'name', 'Rome', 'second', 'season', 'continued', '2007', 'past', 'negative', 'portrayals', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'fictional', 'series', 'based', 'factual', 'events', 'lives', 'various', 'individuals', 'including', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'former', 'mistress', 'Servilia', 'Lindsay', 'Duncan', 'power-hungry', 'Atia', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'who', 'was', 'related', 'Caesar', 'Atia', 'son', 'Gaius', 'Octavian', 'Max', 'Pirkis', 'teenager', 'Simon', 'Woods', 'young', 'man', 'Octavian', 'friend', 'general', 'Marcus', 'Vipsanius', 'Agrippa', 'Allen', 'Leech', 'who', 'love', 'Octavian', 'sister', 'Octavia', 'Kerry', 'Condon', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'who', 'forced', 'marry', 'Octavia', 'keep', 'peace', 'Octavian', 'Servilia', 'son', 'Marcus', 'Junius', 'Brutus', 'Tobias', 'Menzies', 'Cleopatra', 'Lyndsey', 'Marshal', 'Senator', 'Marcus', 'Tullius', 'Cicero', 'David', 'Bamber', 'two', 'Roman', 'soldiers', 'Lucius', 'Vorenus', 'Kevin', 'McKidd', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'Ray', 'Stevenson', 'Lucius', 'Veronus', 'still', 'tragic', 'character', 'wanted', 'only', 'provide', 'wife', 'Niobe', 'Indira', 'Varma', 'who', 'died', 'first', 'season', 'children', 'who', 'were', 'enslaved', 'Having', 'served', 'military', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'briefly', 'senator', 'given', 'control', 'Rome', 'commercial', 'district', 'eventually', 'army', 'being', 'rejected', 'children', 'rescuing', 'slavery', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Egypt', 'Lucius', 'Veronus', 'often', 'less', 'educated', 'friend', 'Titus', 'Pullo', 'who', 'huge', 'temper', 'often', 'physical', 'aggression', 'solve', 'disputes', 'Servilia', 'being', 'spurned', 'Julius', 'Caesar', 'first', 'season', 'encouraged', 'son', 'Brutus', 'murder', 'must', 'instead', 'mourn', 'Brutus', 'eventual', 'death', 'was', 'Caesar', 'death', 'Octavian', 'declared', 'son', 'heir', 'rather', 'seriously', 'chagrin', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'Atia', 'lover', 'Atia', 'highly', 'fictionalized', 'series', 'still', 'egocentric', 'wanton', 'manipulator', 'very', 'attached', 'Mark', 'Antony', 'relationship', 'not', 'last', 'may', 'fulfill', 'curse', 'bitter', 'enemy', 'Servilia.With', 'frequent', 'sexual', 'intrigue', 'nudity', 'Rome', 'series', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'network', 'television', 'did', 'find', 'very', 'good', 'home', 'HBO', 'very', 'interesting', 'portrayal', 'life', 'ancient', 'Rome', 'many', 'perspectives', 'wonderful', 'dialog', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'engaging', 'characters', 'rate', 'Rome-The', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'resounding', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

Battles, decay, sex, politics, daily life and fashion over flow in each episode.If you are looking for facts, there are some, but there are also some major changes done to history.  Antony never killed anybody on the Senate floor, that we know of, and Octavian never declared war against Antony.  He declared war against the Queen Cleopatra.

1071043,A2HOI4JAQDNPS,B000PGTPH8,Mother Brown,"[16, 20]","I was very disappointed with the second series of Rome.  I loved  the first: found it completely enthralling, loved the way they worked in the double plots of the major political narrative and the everyman story of Pullo and Vorenus.  And it looks great.  I'm a classicist, but I didn't care about the various historical innaccuracies.  It's TV, not a text-book.  And it caught something  convincing about Roman culture -- the violence, the honour, the sex, the guilt.  But I have been really disappointed with the second series.  What's missing? Well, here's a list:--The first series all had enormous momentum, building up to two inevitable but terribly upsetting deaths: J. Caesar, and Vorenus' wife.  The momentum is gone in the second series.  Of course, we're still building up to something -- the new Augustan age.  But it djust doesn't have that feeling of something important about to happen.--I think it was a mistake to change actors for Octavian/.  The new one is good, and obviously they had to mark a change.  But the old one was a more complex character.--I The representation of slavery is far less convincing in the second series.  In the first, we were shown very clearly that slaves really are not free; they get shut up in cages and whipped.  Pullo is making a big mistake in thinking that a slave girl who sleeps with him might be doing so of her own free will.  Slaves are never free.  In the second series, all that seems to have been forgotten.  Slavery means that there is always a cute girl hanging around to have sex with you.  Vorenus' daughteris annoyed with Vorenus, but she doesn't seem damaged by her experiences.  The relationship between Pullo and Eirene is, in my opinion, entirely implausible.  Why does she klove him or forgive him?  We are never shown any reason.  This leaves a big gap in the whole non-political plot of the second series.  Vorenus' troubles with his children iare  just not as interesting or convincing as his troubles with his wife in the first series.  And the Vorenus/Pullo relationship has lost its spark, now they are no longer fighting together.--I had to fast forward some of hte first series, for the violence.  But I had to do that even more with the second.  It's just too much.  And it seems as if the brutality is substituting for real character development.--Why don't people kill themselves in Rome?  What happened to  ""playing hte Roman"" and falling on one's sword?  I liked the old-Etonian depiction of Brutus and Cassius; but surely at least one of them could have killed themselves...--I thought it was a mistake to entwine the narratives quite so closely.  The death of Cicero was certainly not accurate historically, which doesn't matter; but more importantly, it was implausible in the terms of the series itself.  Pullo's dialogue in that scene  range entirely false: surely Pullo cares about his honour and immortality, not just saving his life!  This just doidn't fit the character.  They might as well have done the scene from Plutarch.  Here as elsewhere, I felt that the series-two writers were trying too hard to turn Rome into The Sopranos -- a more successful series, not necessarily a better one.  Yes, Rome was full of gansters and gangster molls.  But I missed the sense of political and emotional complexity, which hte first series had to a much greater extent.",3,2nd series is much less good than the 1st,1188259200,"08 28, 2007",2007,3352,"['was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'second', 'series', 'Rome', 'loved', 'first', 'found', 'completely', 'enthralling', 'loved', 'way', 'worked', 'double', 'plots', 'major', 'political', 'narrative', 'everyman', 'story', 'Pullo', 'Vorenus', 'great', ""'m"", 'classicist', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'various', 'historical', 'innaccuracies', 'TV', 'not', 'text-book', 'caught', 'something', 'convincing', 'Roman', 'culture', 'violence', 'honour', 'sex', 'guilt', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'disappointed', 'second', 'series', 'What', 'missing', 'Well', 'here', 'list', 'first', 'series', 'had', 'enormous', 'momentum', 'building', 'up', 'two', 'inevitable', 'terribly', 'upsetting', 'deaths', 'J.', 'Caesar', 'Vorenus', 'wife', 'momentum', 'gone', 'second', 'series', 'course', ""'re"", 'still', 'building', 'up', 'something', 'new', 'Augustan', 'age', 'djust', ""n't"", 'have', 'feeling', 'something', 'important', 'happen.', 'think', 'was', 'mistake', 'change', 'actors', 'Octavian/', 'new', 'one', 'good', 'obviously', 'had', 'mark', 'change', 'old', 'one', 'was', 'more', 'complex', 'character.', 'representation', 'slavery', 'far', 'less', 'convincing', 'second', 'series', 'first', 'were', 'shown', 'very', 'clearly', 'slaves', 'really', 'are', 'not', 'free', 'get', 'shut', 'up', 'cages', 'whipped', 'Pullo', 'making', 'big', 'mistake', 'thinking', 'slave', 'girl', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'doing', 'so', 'own', 'free', 'will', 'Slaves', 'are', 'never', 'free', 'second', 'series', 'have', 'been', 'forgotten', 'Slavery', 'always', 'cute', 'girl', 'hanging', 'around', 'have', 'sex', 'Vorenus', 'daughteris', 'annoyed', 'Vorenus', ""n't"", 'seem', 'damaged', 'experiences', 'relationship', 'Pullo', 'Eirene', 'opinion', 'entirely', 'implausible', 'Why', 'klove', 'forgive', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'reason', 'big', 'gap', 'whole', 'non-political', 'plot', 'second', 'series', 'Vorenus', 'troubles', 'children', 'iare', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'convincing', 'troubles', 'wife', 'first', 'series', 'Vorenus/Pullo', 'relationship', 'lost', 'spark', 'now', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'fighting', 'together.', 'had', 'fast', 'forward', 'hte', 'first', 'series', 'violence', 'had', 'do', 'even', 'more', 'second', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'brutality', 'substituting', 'real', 'character', 'development.', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'people', 'kill', 'Rome', 'What', 'happened', 'playing', 'hte', 'Roman', 'falling', 'one', 'sword', 'liked', 'old-Etonian', 'depiction', 'Brutus', 'Cassius', 'surely', 'least', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'killed', 'thought', 'was', 'mistake', 'entwine', 'narratives', 'quite', 'so', 'closely', 'death', 'Cicero', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'accurate', 'historically', ""n't"", 'matter', 'more', 'importantly', 'was', 'implausible', 'terms', 'series', 'Pullo', 'dialogue', 'scene', 'range', 'entirely', 'false', 'surely', 'Pullo', 'honour', 'immortality', 'not', 'just', 'saving', 'life', 'just', 'doid', ""n't"", 'fit', 'character', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'done', 'scene', 'Plutarch', 'Here', 'elsewhere', 'felt', 'series-two', 'writers', 'were', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'turn', 'Rome', 'Sopranos', 'more', 'successful', 'series', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'one', 'Yes', 'Rome', 'was', 'full', 'gansters', 'gangster', 'molls', 'missed', 'sense', 'political', 'emotional', 'complexity', 'hte', 'first', 'series', 'had', 'much', 'greater', 'extent']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

Durham ""Big Evil""","[123, 143]","As the second, and final, season of HBO's lavishly produced Rome begins, saying that things aren't good is saying it quite lightly.  Caesar (Ciaran Hinds) is dead, Mark Antony (James Purefoy) prepares to go to war with Brutus (Tobias Menzies), and Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd) mourns his dead wife (Indira Varma) as the fate of his children hang in the balance.  Later on, alliances are broken, re-forged, and broken again, as the series propels itself through a breakneck pace throughout these ten episodes that find Vorenus and Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson) in new business situations, Atia (Polly Walker) and Servilia (Lindsay Duncan) schemeing against each other to new heights, Octavian (played by Max Pirkis in his young days, and later by Simon Woods) rising to power and seemingly defying everyone, and concluding in the blood stained sand of Egypt as Antony and Cleopatra (Lyndsay Marshall) make a stand against Octavian, and Vorenus helps Pullo unite him with the child he never knew he had.  What makes Rome so good are the performances from everyone involved.  Not only are McKidd and Stevenson perfect together, but James Purefoy steals the entire show with his swaggery and arrogant performance as the womanizing, battle hungry, and life loving Mark Antony.  The production values, which have always been a standout of the series, are still lavishly re-created, and the violence is still incredibly graphic and blood curdling at spots.  All in all, while the usual twelve episodes would have been more than welcome instead of ten, the final season of Rome is a brilliantly realized vision of the rise and fall of the powerful empire, and the performances from all involved are worth the price of admission alone.

The appeal of this heavily fictionalized look at the last days of the Roman Republic is attested to by the continuing enthusiasm of its fans--if you don't believe me, examine the ""Rome"" message boards on HBO's website and read some of the riotous posts there.Season 2 continues in much the same vein as Season 1, although the atmosphere and the moments of comic relief are darker, and several of the major characters from Season 1--Julius Caesar, Pompey Magnus, and the lovely plebeian Niobe--are no longer with us. In the wake of Caesar's assassination by Brutus (well-played by Tobias Menzies), Cassius, and their colleagues, Caesar's relatives and subordinates struggle to fill the power vacuum left by his death. When young Gaius Octavian (portrayed first by the excellent Max Pirkis and later, as an adult, by Simon Woods) is named Caesar's heir the stage is set for his intense rivalry with Mark Antony (a charismatic James Purefoy). As a seasoned warrior, close associate of Caesar, consul, and the lover of Octavian's sultry mother, Atia (a delightfully wicked Polly Walker), Antony has the support of much of Rome's army, as well as an element of power over the Senate. The struggle between his forces and Octavian's involve various members of the Palatine Hill's aristocracy, among them Brutus' vindictive mother Servilia (Lindsay Duncan), and members of the Senate like the slippery orator Cicero (David Bamber). To bolster his image with the public and assist him in his new role as Caesar's successor, Octavian employs a Rat Pack of Young Turks, including a charmingly shy Marcus Agrippa (Allen Leech)--who falls in love with Octavian's beautiful, unhappy sister Octavia (Kerry Condon). In the meantime the tyrannicides have fled Rome, mustered an army, and are poised to battle the new official government--the uneasy triumvirate of Octavian, Antony, and (a nearly invisible) Lepidus.In contrast to the machinations of the upper class rivals, we have the equally poisonous but somewhat more violent conflicts among the citizens of the Aventine, Rome's semi-slummy district of laborers, immigrants, and lower-class tradesmen. In an interesting reversal of fortune and character the once upright and moralistic Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd in an intense performance), a former legionary in Caesar's army, has become the embittered, rage-filled leader of a shady workman's collegium, or trade association, whereas Titus Pullo (portrayed with delightful insouciance by the appealing Ray Stevenson), former roisterer and violence-prone soldier, has become a caring husband and devoted friend. Colorful figures from their gritty milieu include Pullo's pretty, sylph-like wife, the former slavegirl Eirene (Chiara Mastalli), the cold-eyed and voluptuous Gaia (Zuleikha Robinson), who does her best to entrap both Vorenus and Pullo, and various members and enforcers of the Aventine's guilds and labor-related organizations.Add to this mix the ambitions of a seductive, amoral Cleopatra Philopater (Lyndsey Marshall), who eventually singles out Antony as the prop she needs to keep her rule of Egypt in the pink and protect her young son by Julius Caesar. Although HBO's character  deviates strongly from the historical Cleopatra, an intelligent, charming, and well-educated Queen of Egypt, she is fun to watch if only for the sake of her consistently self-serving attitude and her slithery manipulation of the men in her life.There are several subplots in the series, one of which involves Timon, the Jewish horsetrader and sometime assassin employed by Atia to do her dirty work, another concerning the estranged children of Lucius Vorenus and their distrust and hatred of their father. All of these elements add up to gripping television drama, colorful pageantry, and yes, lots and lots of violence and fairly graphic (and sometimes violent) sex. There is a great deal to enjoy, on a visual as well as a dramatic level, and the concluding episode, which brings the story to an end a little too suddenly, leaves the viewer wishing that HBO could have shelled out the denari for at least one more season.

1071055,AD0J5KK4WQXNS,B000PGTPH8,OverTheMoon,"[5, 5]","Rome is no doubt the most adult mainstream television series to air. Nobody could have predicted that debauchery could look so respectable. Forget good guys versus bad guys. There are no good people in Rome. Even the most well respected citizen should be seen at least contemplating murder or an animal sacrifice to one of the gods.Where movies like ""Gladiator"" would have even the lowest dregs of society looking splendorous for the big screen, the producers of Rome have correctly decided that these ancient civilizations are not really that civil, especially if put in the context that these people where around over a thousand years before the Dark Ages.It is a pessimistic excess orientation coupled with screenwriters hanging pairs of brass ones, makes this show pay off in aces. Although the cast look human, their all too manifest instincts to copulate uncontrollably and destroy lives randomly sees them pushed back somewhat along the primordial scale, which is uncanny to see, when you put excellent actors and a script that isn't afraid to bare it all, with a few severed limbs and few gallons of blood to boot.In Season 1 it was the dawn of the rise of the warrior and slave while the `Golden Age' of Rome had seen its last philosopher now taking backhanders, the senate marble floor looking as worn as the legions returning home after being sent out on a near decade long mission to defeat the Gauls. Caesar has been murdered and so the battle for control of Rome is what Season 2 is all about.Titus Pullo (Ray Stevenson) and Lucius Vorenus (Kevin McKidd), two warriors of the thirteenth around which the series is built are back however Rome season 2 is mostly about Octavian and Mark Antony fighting for control over Rome after the cremation of Caesar.Lucius Vorenus is recovering from the death of his wife and has lost his family. As a nice touch we see the formation of the Italian mafia (the Collegium). Cicero tries to play lip service to all sides and gets into some handy work. Duro, a young servant attempts to carry out Servilia's plan to murder Atia.Octavian has grown up into the new Caesar while Agrippa falls for Octavia. Brutus and Cassius are declared enemies of the state. Will Mark Antony become Octavian's ally or will they continue to fight? Titus Pullo's wife, Eirene, has a surprise. Greece becomes the location for a big showdown and finally we get the epic battle we have all been waiting for.Lots of people are mysteriously killed overnight and there are a few shock suicides along the way. Posca gets a bigger role and Herod shows up. The new slave girl, Gaia, puts all wickedness to shame while a strangulation death-bed scene is sure to leave viewers traumatized. There are also some dreadful torture sequences (involving kids and women) and the sex scenes are scandalous for mainstream television (and maybe even for the adult channel!). The show eventually turns to Alexandria, Egypt with Cleopatra for the grand finale and the exit of some major characters.Rome is all about power and avoiding humiliation. At the same time the complexity of the drama on display is impressive enough to give the viewer a new lease of life by thinking about the world as they have never seen it before. HBO/BBC have recreated a much needed and severely wanted historical drama. There are some minor limitations. There is a Jewish story which doesn't develop so well, but looks good. The young outstanding, Max Pirkis, who plays Gaius Octavian, leaves prematurely because they must replace him with an older actor, Simon Woods, who is convincing as the new Caesar. Season 2 is two episodes less than season 1. You can watch it very quickly. It is only 10 episodes long.The other regretful news is that before Season 2 was released the producers announced that this was to be the final Season. Rome was originally conceived as a mini-series anyway but HBO/BBC thought it good enough to at least turn into a season. We are lucky to have two seasons. Also the $100 million cost per season didn't generate the enormous returns expected from big investment, even though Rome had millions of viewers. If fans want to push for another season there is the problem that the sets burned down in an accidental fire at Cinecitta Studios backlot. So it seems Rome season 1 and 2 are all there is... but its two seasons of some of the maddest, baddest, intellectual drama ever seen on TV.

Yochim,"[1, 1]","""Rome"" continues the saga of the fall of the Roman Republic and its transformation into an empire, as seen from the lives of the movers and shakers and those caught in their wake. More than 15 years are distilled into a few short months of pleasurable viewing.Caeasar lays dead on the Senate floor and Mark Antony runs for his life. An uneasy truce develops between the assassins and Antony. Caesar stirs things up from beyond the grave and declares his young nephew Octavian as his sole heir. Cicero jockeys for power in the Senate, scheming with both Antony and Brutus and Cassius, while meanwhile a very cunning boy emerges from behind the scenes. Octavian and Antony fight, and then reconcile to defeat the assassins in a desparate alliance, only to fight again.Roman history truly surpasses the plot of any soap opera.Meanwhile on the streets of Rome, two unlikely comrades struggle for their own lives, hopelessly adrift in the sea of history. Lucius Vorenus, last season's grim military arch-conservative, goes mad following his wife's suicide. His more epicurean comrade Titus Pullo, however, finds a measure of happiness in the arms of a freedwoman and provides the story with needed stability.Don't look to ""Rome"" for your history substitute.

1071070,AUM3YMZ0YRJE0,B000PGTPH8,Robert J. Crawford,"[3, 3]","so Titus Pullo asked Cicero, who requested a few moments of reflection, before executing him congenially and respectfully.  ""He wasn't a snob,"" Pullo said, as he returned to the family picnic with Cicero's hands in a sack - he had also been ordered to nail them to the Senate door by Marc Antony.  (Not shown in the film is that Antony's wife, Fulvia, mutilated Cicero's head in a frenzy of vengance.)I watched this twice, back to back, over three weeks (never more than 2 per night).  I must say that, as a Rome buff, this is an utterly riveting and vivid tour of an ancient culture that seems familiar yet is frighteningly alien.The historical context is clear:  Julius Caesar is gone, and there is a death fight to determine whether or not the Republic can be revived.  The characters - with the exception of the plot props, Pullo and Vorenus -  are real.  Caesar's adoptive heir, Octavius, must unite with his adversary, Marc Antony, to fight the forces loyal to Brutus, before they fight eachother to determine who will rule Rome as supreme leader.  I will not play the spoiler, but just say that the drama is absolutely splendidly vivid.  And in the gross outline, historically accurate.Oddly, I found the best part to be the ongoing melodrama of Pullo and Vorenus.  Wholly fictional, Vorenus must cope with the destruction of his family.  It gets worse than you could possibly image our modern vantage.  Meanwhile, Pullo - the symbolic survivor of the end of he republic - is adapting to his new role, employing the violence that he knows is the only thing he will ever do well.  Their story is really wonderful, a great plot device, and emotionally real.  It alone is worth the price of admission:  as I said, you really feel what it was like to live then, even smell it.  (""You see,"" Pullo's ignorant wife says, ""a slave is better when you beat her"" as the slave winks at Pullo before doing even worse.)  Vorenus is an honorable man turned criminal, still bound by oath to Antony, but also to the values of the republic; he cannot adjust and his fate is entirely believable yet unimaginable.  Truly fine fiction.If you know the history, it must be admitted that the producers played fast and loose to the point of the truly ludicrous.  Atia and Antony were married to others and there is no evidence that they had a love affair, Octavius was married twice by the time he met Livia, etc.  These things are known, not uncertain at all:  it is pure poetic license and makes the plot move better, e.g. the rivalry of Sevillia and Atia, also fictional.  I wish it were more accurate in these details, but the plot is nonetheless extremely taut.That being said, the portrayals of Octavius and Anthony are also wonderful:  Octavius is a cold and calculating visionary, Antony is a sensual creature looking for his piece of the glory and not thinking too far ahead.  The sincere Agrippa is excellent as well, a natural adjunct to a political genius, as is the cynical Mycenas.  Brutus, who is emerging as a courageous leader of potential, is also finely acted.  Finally, Antony and Cleopatra, in the drug-induced search for pleasure and excess, are priceless.Warmly recommended.  This is fun and deeply stimulating.  If you take it for what it is, the entertainment value is first rate.

Yes, as others have noted, there are some historical inaccuracies, but that is not a major problem in this series.  The film does tell the story of the falling out between Octavius and Mark Antony in a plausible and convincing way.  The Cleopatra character could have been expanded upon a bit.  In this film we never really come to know her or understand her.  On the other hand, we all come to love Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus, whose characters are wonderfully done.  Mark Antony is also strongly portrayed here.  And lest I forget, so is Octavius Caesar, who is indeed, as Cleopatra comes to see, a literal monster.  I did not expect to like the actor who plays Octavius Caesar, but I came do do so, very much.  Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus steal the series with powerful and engaging performances and characterizations.A few nits.  In Season One Atia appears as a heartless but cunning manipulator of her men.  In Season Two she deteriorates into a vapid and indeed tiresome wretch who I could have done with much less of.  Octavian, her son, sums her up pretty well.Octavius Caesar's defeat of Antony's forces is never explained, and one almost suspects that this portion of the script was cut for budgetary reasons.  For this reason the Agrippa character never really takes off in this series, despite his importance as one of Octavian Caesar's right-hand men.The DVDs here are attractively packaged, and feature excellent color, definition, and sound.  This is a wonderful value.Overall, this is a fine work.  It is both intellectual and entertaining, and most viewers will return to ""Rome"" many times.

1071074,A3572FTYUQQW3P,B000PGTPH8,Royce Callaway,"[7, 7]","I loved the first season and the second season is just as good although it is more like a soap opera -- but for the most part this is history as it happened.  I was astonished to discover that Lucius Vorenus and Titus Pullo were real people although in history they were both Centurions serving Julius Caesar.  They were both hellions and dare devils but little else seems to be written about them.  They do provide a very good vehicle for observing Rome from all sides.  There is no doubt that Octavius was very smart and the series offers a reasonable ratonale for the falling out between Antony and Octavian.  However, the probablity is that Octavian was simply manuvering for power and outsmarted Antony who wasn't known for his billiance.  In fact historically Antony was as Cicero called him -- a drunken sex addled lout.  Cicero was not physically brave and he himself admitted this but I don't think he was a weak and craven as this series portrays him to be and certainly he didn't have the control over the Senate like the series indicates.  Atia and Servilla seem to have greater roles in this series than they did in history -- but all of these are petty criticisms.  This is a great series and for those who want a third series they should watch ""I Claudius"" to see Augustus Caesar in action.This is a well written beautifully photgraphed, and brilliantly staged production.  The language is a little rough, the sex a little graphic, and the violence extreme, but then at the time Rome was a very violent city where armed escorts were needed after dark.  Sex was a part of everyday life but moreso among the gentry as this series shows.  Overall this is certainly the best miniseries I have seen and I recommend it highly.  It would be a good history lesson except the language and sex probably make it unsuitable for a classroom.  From my reading of Roman History this series shows Rome as it was, the clothing as it was, lighting, food, everything seems very authentic.

Season Two picks up in the immediate aftermath of the assassination, as Mark Antony narrowly escapes his own murder as he leaves the Senate.Just as with Season One, Season Two takes an ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" approach to telling its story.  While Season Two uses the struggle between Brutus, Mark Antony, and Octavian Caesar as its main storyline, there is plenty of time spent on the lower classes as well.  Marcus Vorenus and Titus Pullo are back for more murder and mayhem, and they provide some of the strongest emotional points of the series.There's plenty of blood and sex to go 'round, particularly after Antony arrives in Alexandria for an extended debauch with Cleopatra, but ""Rome"" is far more than a T&A;, blood-and-guts exploitation show.  ""Rome"" goes to great care to remind us that Romans were real flesh-and-blood people, with real concerns.

Season 2 I didn't think was as enthralling, but when you come from 'excellent', the next place down is 'very, very good' and that's what this is.Others have expounded on inaccuracies as to the history.  As a student of history myself, I can understand the frustration.  However, these things do not bother me generally as I watch series like these to escape.  All I generally ask is that I be entertained.  (NOTE: I admit that my 'laidbackness' did not extend to the massacred 'Troy' which was so very inaccurate in so many particulars and not even that entertaining).So that entire paragraph above was meant to convey the following: Put aside your history books, forget the 'true' story and allow yourself to be immersed in the grandeur and sumptiousness that is this BBC/HBO production.I believe that you will love many of the characters (notably Atia) - and love to hate others (notably Atia).  You will be sad and happy and yes - horrified at times, but you will not say that you were not invested in some measure.  Note that even those not as enamoured of the series as I, watched every episode AND took the time out to write reviews.  That must tell you something.  Rome is something to witness and talk about, whatever your view.WARNING: If the DVD is the first time you are watching this, clear hours of your day.

Season 2 focuses on Octavian's rise to Emperor of Rome by political guile and bloody force.We watch through 10 Season 2 episodes as Octavian gains power over his adversary at times--friend at times--stepfather figure at times Marc Anthony. Cleopatra is also back and has a bigger role in Season 2.But the fun is watching Pullo and Vorenus battle violently in violent times and struggle with their own family values, loyalty to the Empire and friendship to each other.The series is not always action-packed and moves along a bit slowly at times, but overall it is very well done.

1071089,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,B000PGTPH8,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[11, 11]","The second and concluding season of this spectacular television series duplicates the success of the first. What the writers have produced here, as in Season One, is less a strict history lecture than a history play, a contemporary British equivalent of one of Shakespeare's favored genres. One doesn't look in such a genre, then or now, for literal accuracy to actual history in all details as a primary determinant of worth. Instead, the following of history's broad outlines, coupled with deliberate fiction, to reveal the workings of human nature, both in the political sphere and private life, and so cleverly and disturbingly to confront modern viewers with shocks of recognition seems to be the point.The acting, even in the absence of the magnificent Caesar of Ciaran Hinds, remains of the highest quality; the cast features not a single weak link.  As before, costumes and sets are a treat for the eyes, and the TV dialogue is of greater skill than might be found in any ten widely-praised off-Broadway plays put together.The episodes in Season Two center on the political rise of Rome's first emperor, Augustus Caesar, and the concurrent decline of Antony and Cleopatra. The world of this history play thematically is one given over largely, then, to the World vs. the Flesh. Shrewd Augustus is mostly a ""cold boy"" whereas Antony devolves into a stinking decadent. These lopsided alternatives, amusingly enough, have strikingly recognizable equivalents in the secular, postmodern West. The more fully developed human beings among the characters are several from private life, principally Vorenus and his comrade Pullio, who, at least in their attitudes toward their own children, foreshadow a later world of more delicate conscience than the Roman.",5,"""Too Much of a Good Thing Is...Wonderful""",1186876800,"08 12, 2007",2007,1758,"['second', 'concluding', 'season', 'spectacular', 'television', 'series', 'success', 'first', 'What', 'writers', 'have', 'produced', 'here', 'Season', 'One', 'less', 'strict', 'history', 'lecture', 'history', 'play', 'contemporary', 'British', 'equivalent', 'one', 'Shakespeare', 'favored', 'genres', 'One', ""n't"", 'look', 'such', 'genre', 'then', 'now', 'literal', 'accuracy', 'actual', 'history', 'details', 'primary', 'determinant', 'worth', 'Instead', 'following', 'history', 'broad', 'outlines', 'coupled', 'deliberate', 'fiction', 'reveal', 'workings', 'human', 'nature', 'political', 'sphere', 'private', 'life', 'so', 'cleverly', 'disturbingly', 'confront', 'modern', 'viewers', 'shocks', 'recognition', 'be', 'point.The', 'acting', 'even', 'absence', 'magnificent', 'Caesar', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'highest', 'quality', 'cast', 'not', 'single', 'weak', 'link', 'before', 'costumes', 'sets', 'are', 'treat', 'eyes', 'TV', 'dialogue', 'greater', 'skill', 'might', 'be', 'found', 'ten', 'widely-praised', 'off-Broadway', 'plays', 'put', 'together.The', 'episodes', 'Season', 'Two', 'center', 'political', 'rise', 'Rome', 'first', 'emperor', 'Augustus', 'Caesar', 'concurrent', 'decline', 'Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'world', 'history', 'play', 'thematically', 'one', 'given', 'largely', 'then', 'World', 'Flesh', 'Shrewd', 'Augustus', 'mostly', 'cold', 'boy', 'whereas', 'Antony', 'stinking', 'decadent', 'lopsided', 'alternatives', 'amusingly', 'enough', 'have', 'strikingly', 'recognizable', 'equivalents', 'secular', 'postmodern', 'West', 'more', 'fully', 'developed', 'human', 'beings', 'characters', 'are', 'several', 'private', 'life', 'principally', 'Vorenus', 'comrade', 'Pullio', 'who', 'least', 'attitudes', 'own', 'children', 'foreshadow', 'later', 'world', 'more', 'delicate', 'conscience', 'Roman']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

Historical drama at its best - insert the 'extra characters' (Pullo and Verinas) where they can help forward the story, but be completely true to the real history and the 'feel' of the times. The opening credit sequence is stunning.I generally rate these historical dramas low because they jumble the truth about the history so much it makes my head spin. But I felt with Rome that where the poetic license was being taken - Atia, Octavia especially - it was around the edges of the main story, and the producers worked very hard to make the series as a whole felt 'real.' To anyone who knows anything about ancient history, the plot device in the last episode ""About Your Father"" is so obvious - it was just a cute little moment (not the Ceasarian, in real life, had it been true! - but...)Loved Polly Walker! What a great role for her. Love Ray Stevenson - had never seen him in anything else. Seems he was born to play Pullo. Loved James Purefoy as Mark Antony, and Ciaran Hinds as Cesaer.

The beautiful friendship between soldiers Lusius and Titus continues as Lucius deals with disowning his children and coming to terms that they may have been murdered before he had a chance to tell them he truely loved them. The highlight of season two, however, is the campy, yet extraordinary performance of Polly Walker as Atia who continues her sordid affair with sexy Antony and attempts to destroy Caesar's wife Servilia by poisoning her and getting her assaulted. ""Rome"" is typical soap opera, but produced with the greatest production values ever for any television series along with amazing acting. Sadly, season two of ""Rome"" would be its last as HBO couln't afford any more seasons with the series' high production costs. ""Rome"" is daring, more so than other shows of its kind for its explicit use of sex scenes, the violence it depicts, and strong language, but these are attributes that make ""Rome"" an original, and the producers should be applauded for their inventiveness.

The setting, the costumes, and the acting are all very good, particularly the setting, but the plot lines and the writing is atrocious.  This is pure soap opera with very little else.  The writing is just flat out bad.  Why in the world would we have actors spewing such lines as ""oh, bollocks!""?  Why bother with the f-word?  Why such weak casting?  The ""generals"" that support Octavian in his quest to best Mark Antony are mere boys?  Is that factual?  Are we to believe that Rome was built by a bunch of kids?  They could have at least given us actors who had some facial hair, or the ability to grow it.  The actress that plays Atia is awful, and the actress who plays her nemesis is wretched.  Both women are supposed to be extremely attractive, but they are not.  In the meantime, while all of this tripe between them is going on, we are bored to tears with a stupid story that is evolving around ""some"" history.  Do yourself a favor.  Read the Shakespeare play and call it good.  This thing sucks.It is no wonder that Rome was canceled after two seasons.

1071110,A21X0EO0R0T6FT,B000PGTPH8,Vincent Poirier,"[7, 9]","First off, the great outweighs the bad by so much that I give it five stars. But it's so obvious what's good in both seasons of this series that it's hardly worth mentioning.The number of details the production gets right, such as the sets and the costumes, are enough to make you love the series. It's also fun to see how the production plays with the true bits of history, such as how it shows Cicero finally finding courage as he dies.Dramatically the series is addictive and fully satisfying, so I cannot recommend it enough.Now to pick at a few really minor details.-Time. OK, OK, even Shakespeare twisted time around impossibly in all his plays, but we expect a little more respect for internal time lines nowadays. What I found hard to take was how quickly people seemed to move from place to place when there are no planes or trains or automobiles. Even on Rome's extensive network of roads, walking and riding between cities should take months or weeks, not days or hours...-Place. Two major plot points turn on having the impossible happen, viz. having foreign royalty allowed within the sacred boundaries of Rome. Both Cleopatra and Herod are seen within the Pomerium when they would have had to wait outside Rome.-The lictors (official guards) accompanying magistrates have axes bundled in their fasces while in Rome. They only had axes when they were outside Rome because the axes signify a magistrate's authority to execute, and magistrates only had that power outside Rome.-Too many Patrician women enjoy sex too much, when under the Republic they were famously Victorian in their prudishness and were told that during sex proper Roman ladies should take no active part and simply ""think of Rome"". I can believe one character like Atia enjoying herself like she does, but not the lot we're shown.-Lastly a personal opinion on the series' conjectures and dramatic turns. I did not like how Servilia's story is played; she blames Atia for her misfortunes and curses her. In fact, Servilia's misfortune comes about because she (in the series, not in history) caused Caesar's murder when she overreacted to being dumped. That would have been a Shakespearian tragic denouement and I would have played it that way. Still, how the curse affects Atia was well done.But as I said, these failings are minor and I cannot recommend the series enough.Vincent Poirier, Dublin",5,"What's great (the look and feel) and what's not (time, and other small details)",1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,2376,"['First', 'off', 'great', 'bad', 'so', 'much', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'so', 'obvious', 'what', 'good', 'seasons', 'series', 'hardly', 'worth', 'mentioning.The', 'number', 'details', 'production', 'right', 'such', 'sets', 'costumes', 'are', 'enough', 'make', 'love', 'series', 'also', 'fun', 'see', 'how', 'production', 'true', 'bits', 'history', 'such', 'how', 'Cicero', 'finally', 'finding', 'courage', 'dies.Dramatically', 'series', 'addictive', 'fully', 'satisfying', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'pick', 'few', 'really', 'minor', 'details.-Time', 'OK', 'OK', 'even', 'Shakespeare', 'twisted', 'time', 'around', 'impossibly', 'plays', 'expect', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'internal', 'time', 'lines', 'nowadays', 'What', 'found', 'hard', 'take', 'was', 'how', 'quickly', 'people', 'seemed', 'move', 'place', 'place', 'when', 'are', 'planes', 'trains', 'automobiles', 'Even', 'Rome', 'extensive', 'network', 'roads', 'walking', 'riding', 'cities', 'should', 'take', 'months', 'weeks', 'not', 'days', 'hours', '-Place', 'Two', 'major', 'plot', 'points', 'turn', 'having', 'impossible', 'happen', 'viz', 'having', 'foreign', 'royalty', 'allowed', 'sacred', 'boundaries', 'Rome', 'Cleopatra', 'Herod', 'are', 'seen', 'Pomerium', 'when', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'wait', 'outside', 'Rome.-The', 'lictors', 'official', 'guards', 'accompanying', 'magistrates', 'have', 'axes', 'bundled', 'fasces', 'Rome', 'only', 'had', 'axes', 'when', 'were', 'outside', 'Rome', 'axes', 'signify', 'magistrate', 'authority', 'execute', 'only', 'had', 'power', 'Rome.-Too', 'many', 'Patrician', 'women', 'enjoy', 'sex', 'too', 'much', 'when', 'Republic', 'were', 'famously', 'Victorian', 'prudishness', 'were', 'told', 'sex', 'proper', 'Roman', 'ladies', 'should', 'take', 'active', 'part', 'simply', 'think', 'Rome', 'can', 'believe', 'one', 'character', 'Atia', 'enjoying', 'not', 'lot', ""'re"", 'shown.-Lastly', 'personal', 'opinion', 'series', 'conjectures', 'dramatic', 'turns', 'did', 'not', 'how', 'Servilia', 'story', 'played', 'Atia', 'misfortunes', 'fact', 'Servilia', 'misfortune', 'about', 'series', 'not', 'history', 'caused', 'Caesar', 'murder', 'when', 'overreacted', 'being', 'dumped', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'Shakespearian', 'tragic', 'denouement', 'would', 'have', 'played', 'way', 'Still', 'how', 'curse', 'Atia', 'was', 'well', 'done.But', 'said', 'failings', 'are', 'minor', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'series', 'enough.Vincent', 'Poirier', 'Dublin']",Rome:S2 (DVD)

First ""Deadwood"" now this)season of ""Rome"" is just as compelling as the first. The first season ended with the assassination of Julius Ceasar in the Senate. The second season begins with Ceasar's will being read and Octavian being named Ceasar's heir and adopted son. This leads to conflict between Octavian and Antony over who shall lead the Roman Empire. Vorenus falls into despair when he is told his children have been murdered and his friend Titus Pullo must try and give him a reason to live.Featuring a number of stunning performances by Kevin McKidd, Ray Stevenson, Lindsay Ducan, Kerry Condon,James Purefoy and taking on the role of the older Octavian Simon Woods, the production design looks terrific and the show has the rich look of a big screen production. Direction and writing are top notch as well every bit the equal (and in my opinion superior to)the first season.HBO has done a great job as usual with ""Rome"". The show looks just as rich and vibrant as Rome - The Complete First Seasonlooked. We get some terrific extras as with the first set and the packaging is deluxe as well with the same design as the first season.For extras we get ""All Roads Lead to Rome"" the pop up trivia commentary track. We also get five commentary tracks(one featuring James Purefoy who plays Antony, two from creator Bruno Heller and Historical Consultant Jonathan Stamp, one from director John Maybury & actor Lindsay Duncan and one from writer John Melfi & director Carl Franklin)that vary from extremely good to so-so but, more importantly, we get some very good featurettes. The one I liked best was the one that discussed Octavian, a look at the two different Romes--the one for the Plebs and for the wealthy Patricians. Finally we get a very good featurette discussing Antony and Cleopatra's backgrounds, their love affair and the consquences of challenging Octavian. The former featurette also discusses the decisive Battle of Philippi.As with the first season set ""Rome"" comes in a wooden case with the DVDs in a fold out cardboard case inside. We also get small booklet with excerpts from the offical ""Rome"" book with a page on the Ides of March, Togas and the Temple of Jupiter along with a brief intro from the book by creator/writer/producer Bruno Heller.I'd highly recommend the second season of ""Rome"" and am just sad that the series only ran seasons.My review is designed to help those who have not purchased the product.

It has both the perspective of the struggle among the senatorial class and the more common people.

I rented Season 2 Disk 1 as it was just released and am a Roman History buff. I was immediately hooked. Went back the next day and rented the entire first season, watched that (non-stop). The following day the entire 2nd season (non-stop). I don't know how folks who watched this on HBO could wait week to week and then (gasp) until the next season to see the series. Admittedly it does take some creative license with historical facts but it makes the characters much more entertaining.

1071117,AU61CID785ACB,B000PGTPH8,Zuberdeen,"[4, 4]","The only bad thing about HBO's series ""Rome"" is that it has come to an end! What an amazing, fantastic piece of work by everyone involved. Yes, it is not as historically accurate as it might be, and I could see how that could rankle. However, the performances are so outstanding by each and every actor that you simply cannot be disappointed. How often is it that you get to see not one but two older women (and in Hollywood, that means over 25) who have such fabulous, juicy roles? Atia and Servilia are fantastic; Polly Walker's Atia is a force of nature. I must admit that I liked the young Octavian a bit more than the older -- the younger is Max Pirkis, who was so fabulous as the young sailor who loses his arm in Master & Commander. Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson are superb as Vorenus and Pullo, the two soldiers the story is centered on. But I have to say, the total standout is James Purefoy as Mark Antony. Wow. In the first episode of Season Two, to watch him walk up calmly behind Cicero and scare the bejesus out of him, and in Servilia's house no less, is a scream. He is the epitome of ""calm assertive,"" and you know that everyone in that room is frightened to death of him (and for good reason too, as Quintus finds out moments later). He manages to convey great menace and violence with just a look -- an amazing actor. Love him, and the entire series of Rome.
