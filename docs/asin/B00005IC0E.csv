Every cheat trick to create the semblance of a dramatic plot leave one feeling cheated out of the time spent watching this movie.  The writers are totally incompetent.  You have an official terrorism expert working for the government who divulges secrets to a victim of NSA top secret malfeasance, and the perpetrator of that malfeasance is a highly placed guy who commits repeated murders of American citizens as ""acceptable loss.""  And he does it quite without any stealth, being as obvious and as little covered up as if he were overcharging for toilet seats.  This childish misrepresentation seeks to imply that deadly viral projects involve wanton premeditated murder of citizen scientists and their families (as well as established government anti-terrorism agents)without consequences.  And they lay it on, with one murder after another WITHOUT ANY REPRICUSIONS.  Perhaps the producer got his ten year old child to write this script.  This goes over the line in foolishness and paranoid misrepresentation.  In a time when we have to address serious questions regarding the latitude we want to permit our government skullduggery, this sort of movie leaves us chasing absurdities instead of real questions.  I am left totally befuddled about the cinematic standards of anyone who gave this trash more than two star ratings.  This takes poetic license to adsurd proportions.

Whitman (William Hurt) a bio-chemist accidently dispatches his family with a virus. Years later a guard to a chemical plant is dismissed and in an attempt to gain his job back he accidently causes a spill of the same virus.Now the chase is on to catch the contaminated man. In the process we have questions. Was the first incident and accident? And is this time really an accident?We watch the standard team of good guy hazmat team and bad guy NSA banterer as the contaminated man keeps getting away and causing havoc.So what is new about this film?

582049,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B00005IC0E,Michael Butts,"[8, 8]","CONTAMINATED MAN is one of those unknown films that is much better than you might imagine.  A security guard terminated from his position after 22 years (Peter Weller in one of his best roles) accidentally causes a disruption in a chemical laboratory, becoming infected with an extremely contagious and deadly virus.  William Hurt appears as a man who fifteen years before had caused the death of his wife and child by exposing them to the same virus in which he had been working on.  Enter Nastascha McElhone as an anti-terrorist agent, shadowed by a despicable NSA agent (Michael Brandon in a deliciously vile performance), and you have the ingredients for a chase movie.  Weller's touch kills almost instantly, but a serum devised by Hurt can save him.  The NSA thinks he's an anti-terrorist, although we know there's more to that than meets the eye; Weller just wants to see his estranged wife and son once before he dies.What happens in the climax is both saddening and disturbing.  The ending, however, is beautifully done and vengeance is ours.A tight, intriguing thriller.",4,DON'T TOUCH ME,1075334400,"01 29, 2004",2004,1080,"['CONTAMINATED', 'MAN', 'one', 'unknown', 'films', 'much', 'better', 'might', 'imagine', 'security', 'guard', 'terminated', 'position', '22', 'years', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'accidentally', 'disruption', 'chemical', 'laboratory', 'becoming', 'infected', 'extremely', 'contagious', 'deadly', 'virus', 'William', 'Hurt', 'man', 'who', 'years', 'had', 'caused', 'death', 'wife', 'child', 'exposing', 'same', 'virus', 'had', 'been', 'working', 'Enter', 'Nastascha', 'McElhone', 'anti-terrorist', 'agent', 'shadowed', 'despicable', 'NSA', 'agent', 'Michael', 'Brandon', 'deliciously', 'vile', 'performance', 'have', 'ingredients', 'chase', 'movie', 'Weller', 'touch', 'almost', 'instantly', 'serum', 'devised', 'Hurt', 'can', 'save', 'NSA', 'anti-terrorist', 'know', 'more', 'eye', 'Weller', 'just', 'see', 'estranged', 'wife', 'son', 'once', 'climax', 'saddening', 'disturbing', 'ending', 'however', 'beautifully', 'done', 'vengeance', 'ours.A', 'tight', 'intriguing', 'thriller']",N/A

Long hair was fine in it's day but that day has passed and even then long hair on a balding man makes you look 20 years older.  His acting is fine though , as well as peter weller who is always excellent and is very convincing here; the problem is that the whole story is silly and relies on the old villian the u.s. government. BUT. this is taking place in HUNGARY,  the nsa ,which has never done expiriments on people by the way (the cia did lsd etc , the kgb and all of the commies have too though),  unleashes a virus plague that only kills the person who touched by the infected. Which is similiar to ebola, in that it's fluids that get you. They nsa basically takes over hungary as they run after a man who is trying to get home and is infected. Hurts character states if he touches you then you are dead but later remembers his blood can save others which looks really bad. If this had been a evil corporation and not the nsa chasing after the guy it would have made sense ,but the provence of hack writers is to always have some U.S. agency as the bad guy which is just boring.  The film print looks fine and this 1999 film isn't completely terrible but it's just annoying. I watch lots of bad movies and judge them on a b scale or c scale star system because they can't compete with a movies but this one on any scale of being a thriller is just not so good. IN spite of Weller who really brings it home and sexy (then in 99) newcomer Natascha Mcelhone as a cool agent; noone can save this movie from being rather bottom drawer.",2,not hurts career highlight,1294617600,"01 10, 2011",2011,1670,"['william', 'hurt', 'made', 'excellent', 'movies', ""n't"", 'one', 'fact', 'endure', 'one', 'worst', 'haircuts', 'imaginable', 'Long', 'hair', 'was', 'fine', 'day', 'day', 'passed', 'even', 'then', 'long', 'hair', 'balding', 'man', 'look', '20', 'years', 'older', 'acting', 'fine', 'though', 'as', 'well', 'peter', 'weller', 'who', 'always', 'excellent', 'very', 'convincing', 'here', 'problem', 'whole', 'story', 'silly', 'relies', 'old', 'villian', 'u.s.', 'government', 'BUT', 'taking', 'place', 'HUNGARY', 'nsa', 'never', 'done', 'expiriments', 'people', 'way', 'cia', 'did', 'lsd', 'etc', 'kgb', 'commies', 'have', 'too', 'virus', 'plague', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'touched', 'infected', 'Which', 'similiar', 'ebola', 'fluids', 'get', 'nsa', 'basically', 'over', 'hungary', 'run', 'man', 'who', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'infected', 'character', 'states', 'then', 'are', 'dead', 'later', 'remembers', 'blood', 'can', 'save', 'others', 'really', 'bad', 'had', 'been', 'evil', 'corporation', 'not', 'nsa', 'chasing', 'guy', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense', 'provence', 'hack', 'writers', 'always', 'have', 'U.S.', 'agency', 'bad', 'guy', 'just', 'boring', 'film', 'print', 'fine', '1999', 'film', ""n't"", 'completely', 'terrible', 'just', 'annoying', 'watch', 'lots', 'bad', 'movies', 'judge', 'b', 'scale', 'c', 'scale', 'star', 'system', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compete', 'movies', 'one', 'scale', 'being', 'thriller', 'just', 'not', 'so', 'good', 'IN', 'spite', 'Weller', 'who', 'really', 'home', 'sexy', 'then', '99', 'newcomer', 'Natascha', 'Mcelhone', 'cool', 'agent', 'can', 'save', 'movie', 'being', 'rather', 'bottom', 'drawer']",N/A

I was attracted to this movie as it stars two of my fave actors, William Hurt and Peter Weller. The story is about a man-made virus which has been grown in a lab in Europe. An employee accidently contracts the virus, and unknowingly kills everyone he comes in contact with. The plot and momentum of this movie reminds me of the classic Andromeda Strain; but they are different in their own way.This  was released in the UK direct to video (no idea how it was released in the states) but I gave it a go, and it's actually very entertaining. The acting is good and so is the script. If the makers of this movie had invested more $$$ into it, they would have had a blockbuster thriller. This movie is a little gem, and as we're approaching Christmas, this would be an ideal gift for anyone who likes these conspiracy/thriller movies.It will certainly be on my list for Santa!",4,Very Good!,1002672000,"10 10, 2001",2001,949,"[""'m"", 'United', 'Kingdom', 'title', 'here', 'movie', 'Contagion', 'was', 'attracted', 'movie', 'two', 'fave', 'actors', 'William', 'Hurt', 'Peter', 'Weller', 'story', 'man-made', 'virus', 'been', 'grown', 'lab', 'Europe', 'employee', 'accidently', 'contracts', 'virus', 'unknowingly', 'kills', 'everyone', 'contact', 'plot', 'momentum', 'movie', 'classic', 'Andromeda', 'Strain', 'are', 'different', 'own', 'way.This', 'was', 'released', 'UK', 'direct', 'video', 'idea', 'how', 'was', 'released', 'states', 'gave', 'go', 'actually', 'very', 'entertaining', 'acting', 'good', 'so', 'script', 'makers', 'movie', 'had', 'invested', 'more', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'blockbuster', 'thriller', 'movie', 'little', 'gem', ""'re"", 'approaching', 'Christmas', 'would', 'be', 'ideal', 'gift', 'anyone', 'who', 'conspiracy/thriller', 'movies.It', 'will', 'certainly', 'be', 'list', 'Santa']",N/A

SHOPPING TODAY I CAME ACROSS A BIN FULL OF MOVIES MARKED DOWN BECAUSE THE STORE WAS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, THAT'S PURE CANDY TO ME. I BOUGHT ABOUT 15 MOVIES AND THIS ONE WAS ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT WOW SOME GREAT ACTORS I AM GOING TO FORK OUT THE 3 BUCKS AND GIVE IT AGO.I WOULD HAVE PAID 20 BUCKS FOR THIS FILM. THIS IS A AMAZING LITTLE FLICK I CAME ACROSS. THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT A TRUE HORROR THAT COULD HAPPEN. A DEADLY BIOLOGICAL AGENT THAT BY MERE TOUCH ENDS YOUR LIFE.YOU START OUT WITH THE BACK STORY OF THE MAIN STAR WILLIAM HURT WHO IS PLAYING DAVID R. WHITMAN A SCIENTIST WHO STUDIES AND TEST BIOLOGICAL AGENTS. AFTER A HORRIBLE REALITY WITH HIS FAMILY YOU SKIP TO PRESENT DAY.HERE JOSEPH MULLER IS INTRODUCED (PETER WELLER) A WORKER THAT IS FIRED FROM A CHEMICAL PLANT IN BUDAPEST. HE BECOMES INFECTED WITH A DEADLY VIRUS.THE MOVIE TAKES PLACE AS HE COMES IN CONTACT WITH INNOCENT PEOPLE INFECTING THEM KILLING THEM INSTANTLY AS THE VIRUS GROWS.THE MOVIE IS FILLED WITH A NICE SUSPENSE TYPE OF FEEL MIXED WITH DRAMA AND A WONDERFUL SENSE OF REALITY BASED HORROR. I AM SCARED OF REAL HORROR, AND REAL HORROR IS THE VIRUS AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS OUR GOVERNMENT AND OTHERS HAVE AND MAKE.I HAVE TO SAY FOR A MOVIE I HAD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF THIS WORKS IN SO MANY WAYS. THE ACTING IS FLAWLESS.PETER WELLER WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND UNDERRATED ACTOR ACTED HIS BUTT OFF IN THIS MOVIE AND HIS PERFORMANCE AS THE CREEPY CONTAMINATED MAN WAS A GOLDEN PERFORMANCE THAT FEW MOVIES EVEN HAVE. IT IS A REAL SHAME AFTER READING A LOT OF REVIEWS HOW EVERYBODY COULD PUT IT DOWN THE WAY THEY DID.THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WITH THIS MOVIE WAS THE NAME ITSELF, WHY THEY CHOOSE THAT AND COULD NOT COME UP WITH SOMETHING BETTER I WILL NEVER KNOW.THE MOVIE TAKES ANOTHER TURN HALF WAY INTO IT WHICH MAKES IT WONDERFUL YOU ADD THE NSA TRYING TO CATCH JOSEPH MULLER BECAUSE THEY THINK HE IS A TERRORIST SPREADING THE VIRUS ON PURPOSE. ADD IN THE TRUE BAD GUY TO THE SHOW THE LEADER OF THE NSA A MAN NAMED WYLES WHO IS PLAYED BY MICHAEL BRANDON. THIS MAN I WANTED TO SHOOT SO BAD, HE WAS A TRUE PRICK AND A PERFECT BAD GUY IN MY BOOK.THE WHOLE MOVIE IS A VERY WELL ACTED AND PLAYED OUT FILM.
