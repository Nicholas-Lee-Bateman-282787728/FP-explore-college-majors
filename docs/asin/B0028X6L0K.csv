1256280,A1YULX2JKXJ3KC,B0028X6L0K,Marie,"[0, 4]","3 1/2 starsSeason 2 starts off with Lelouch's same old life except Nunnally's not part of the picture since she's has been replace by a boy named Rolo. Of course fans will be confused as heck when they watch the first 15 minutes but don't worry episode 2 will clear some of the ambiguity.Rolo is actually a spie sent by an 'order' to keep an eye on Lelouch to see if anything changes with him. After Suzaku captured Lelouch in r1 episode 25, he turned Lelouch in to his father Charles zi Britannia. Charles believes it would better to erase Lelouch memories along with everyone who attends Ashford so that's how we end up at r2 episode 1. After C2 restores Lelouch's memories were back to r1 all over again except Black Knights welcome 'Zero' with open arms and Kallen knows who Zero really is.The reason why I don't like r2 as much as r1 is because everything becomes predictable. It's kind of easy to tell who they going to get rid of, like how they did with Euphy. Everyone has a geass (I'm exaggerating a little) and the ending is sort like Death Note (shocking I know -_-) But those who watch r1 should r2 so you can see how it really ends. And the ending, it's bittersweet but it's for the best.",3,It's good,1365033600,"04 4, 2013",2013,1201,"['3', '1/2', 'starsSeason', '2', 'Lelouch', 'same', 'old', 'life', 'Nunnally', 'not', 'part', 'picture', 'been', 'replace', 'boy', 'named', 'Rolo', 'course', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'confused', 'heck', 'when', 'watch', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'episode', '2', 'will', 'clear', 'ambiguity.Rolo', 'actually', 'spie', 'sent', ""'order"", 'keep', 'eye', 'Lelouch', 'see', 'anything', 'changes', 'Suzaku', 'captured', 'Lelouch', 'r1', 'episode', '25', 'turned', 'Lelouch', 'father', 'Charles', 'zi', 'Britannia', 'Charles', 'would', 'better', 'erase', 'Lelouch', 'memories', 'everyone', 'who', 'Ashford', 'how', 'end', 'up', 'r2', 'episode', '1', 'C2', 'Lelouch', 'memories', 'were', 'back', 'r1', 'over', 'again', 'Black', 'Knights', 'welcome', ""'Zero"", 'open', 'arms', 'Kallen', 'knows', 'who', 'Zero', 'really', 'is.The', 'reason', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'r2', 'as', 'much', 'r1', 'everything', 'becomes', 'predictable', 'kind', 'easy', 'tell', 'who', 'going', 'get', 'rid', 'how', 'did', 'Euphy', 'Everyone', 'geass', ""'m"", 'exaggerating', 'little', 'ending', 'sort', 'Death', 'Note', 'shocking', 'know', '-_-', 'who', 'watch', 'r1', 'should', 'r2', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'really', 'ending', 'bittersweet', 'best']","Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2, Part 1"
1256281,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0028X6L0K,RavenRing,"[4, 4]","Its been one year since the Black Rebellion and the death of Zero. Lelouch is living the life of an average high schooler together with his little brother Rolo and.... huh? It seems that Lelouch has completely forgotten not only Nunnally, but also his identity as Zero. Caught in an attack by the Black Knights, Lelouch meets with a mysterious women named C.C., who reminds him of who he is and of his true purpose.....I was so confused when I started this season. I had to pause the episode and make sure there wasn't an OVA or something I was missing. But explanations come by the end of the episode and we get right back into the rebellion. And wow, the rebellion actually goes somewhere. I had high expectations from the first season of Code Geass, but I was still a little worried about being let down. But no, this season not only met my expectations, but exceeded them. It does have a lot more battle scenes than the first season, which I found a little boring, but the plot moves right along and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't know the last time I was so excited about a show/movie. I even had trouble sleeping at one point.The ending seems to get mixed reviews from most people. I thought it was phenomenally done, but I can see why some people might not enjoy it. However, the series is just too good to miss, so forget about the ending and just watch the show!One warning though. This is set 1 of 4. Hopefully one day they will release a boxed set, but until then prepare to sink some money into this show if you want to own it.UPDATE 1/16/12 - Bandai is downsizing and will no longer release new DVDs after Febuary. They will continue to manufacture and release DVDs already available until their license expires. BUT LUCKY FOR US!!!! For on February 7 there is to be a boxed set release of Code Geass R2!
