It's just a delicous spread of lunacy and information about one of the funniest men alive.

Enjoyed watching these DVD's that showed a lot of his life prior to me being born.  I don't know how Carl Reiner can keep a straight face around him when they do the 2,000 year old man.

1576680,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B008VIMLXM,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[82, 84]","I have spent the last week literally falling off my sofa watching this wonderful collection of Mel Brooks material - at least 75% of it new to me - and I'm a huge MB fan. This should NOT be confused with a set called The Mel Brooks Collection - which is a repackaging of all of Brooks' feature films.While Shout Factory - a company formed by former Rhino exec Richard Foos - releases some great DVD and CD packages (with creative packaging too!) this time they partnered with Brooks' own company- Brooksfilm - and that gave them access to lots of rare material AND new introductions by Brooks himself. Look at the running time (11 hours!) and know that much of this material has either not been seen in the US ( The ""Audience With..."" comes from the BBC) or is newly created (""I Thought I was Taller.. A Short History of Mel Brooks"", a new five-part ""Mel and His Movies"", which has Mel discussing every one of his films, or hasn't been seen in 50 years (the TV commercials he made with Dick Cavett. Speaking of Cavett, HBO showed an hour of Cavett and Brooks last year, but it's never been out on DVD, and here we get ""bonus footage"". Many MB fans know he created the TV show ""Get Smart"" and the ""long forgotten"" series ""When Things Were Rotten"" but we also get to see the pilot for ""Inside Danny Barker"" - written two years before ""Get Smart"", and directed by Arthur Hiller before HE became famous. It may be the only unfunny 25 minutes on this set - it's a domestic sitcom - but at least we get to see it.In addition to the five DVDs there is a CD with the audio from two TV talk shows (David Susskind and Les Crane) plus the ""songs"" that we all know, and love, from MB's films. The discs are all packed in a 60 page hard-bound book with great essays and photos. And yes, the 2000-year old man is here - there's even an hour-long documentary about it.I could go on and on but if you are a MB fan - and that's probably why you found my review - you need this set! No doubt about it. You'll re-watch your favorite moments  -and, probably, like me - show parts of this to your friends and family to show them breadth of Brooks talent (writer, director, composer, stand-up comic, and very-very-very funny guy!)I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""",5,With Brooks co-producing this set we have material that is rarely seen with new introductions by MB!
