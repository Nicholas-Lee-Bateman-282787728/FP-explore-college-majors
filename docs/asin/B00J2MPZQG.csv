1695327,AJVFPC26GHXGF,B00J2MPZQG,"Amanda Felix ""angelbuff""","[1, 1]","Have been a fan of Gina Carano since I saw her in Haywire. Ava is a newly wed and is on a Caribbean  island where her new husband(Cam Gigandet) and family owns a house they rarle use. They soon find a guide that takes them to a bar where she catches the eye of a man(Danny Trejo) and wants to dance with her. When she and her husband fend off his advances, she shows them she is not to be trifled with and does a number on several of the men and a few women, They are whisked away by their guide and decide to put it all behind them and continue their honeymoon. The next day they are taken to several places on the island and one particular place which she is not too sure about, a zip line that is more than a mile long. While she hangs back her husband decides he wants to try it unfortunately the straps break and he plunges into the forest where she discovers him badly injured. An ambulance arrives and takes him to the hospital but once there, she learns that he is not there, nor can she find him anywhere. Going to the police, they immediately question her, believing she might have killed him in a rage, after all they do have evidence that she can more than handle herself. Seeking help from her in laws, they attempt to find him only to have her father-in-law question her also believing she might have killed him for their money. Alone and with no one to trust, she must now find out what happened to her husband but she is thwarted every step of the way by the disappearance of her guide and the people that suddenly do no know her. Determined to find her husband, Ava sets out on a one woman vendetta, taking down anyone she believes is responsible for the disappearance of her husband. It is a race against time, one that will leave you on the edge of your seat and loving every minute and every blow Ava delivers in her quest to find the only person she has ever loved before it is too late.",5,"Gina does what she does best, Kick major A*&%!!",1405209600,"07 13, 2014",2014,1908,"['Have', 'been', 'fan', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'saw', 'Haywire', 'Ava', 'newly', 'wed', 'Caribbean', 'island', 'where', 'new', 'husband', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', 'family', 'house', 'rarle', 'use', 'soon', 'find', 'guide', 'bar', 'where', 'eye', 'man', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'dance', 'When', 'husband', 'fend', 'off', 'advances', 'not', 'be', 'trifled', 'number', 'several', 'men', 'few', 'women', 'are', 'whisked', 'away', 'guide', 'decide', 'put', 'continue', 'honeymoon', 'next', 'day', 'are', 'taken', 'several', 'places', 'island', 'one', 'particular', 'place', 'not', 'too', 'sure', 'zip', 'line', 'more', 'mile', 'long', 'back', 'husband', 'try', 'unfortunately', 'straps', 'break', 'forest', 'where', 'badly', 'injured', 'ambulance', 'arrives', 'hospital', 'once', 'there', 'not', 'there', 'can', 'find', 'anywhere', 'Going', 'police', 'immediately', 'question', 'believing', 'might', 'have', 'killed', 'rage', 'do', 'have', 'evidence', 'can', 'more', 'handle', 'Seeking', 'help', 'laws', 'attempt', 'find', 'only', 'have', 'father-in-law', 'question', 'also', 'believing', 'might', 'have', 'killed', 'money', 'Alone', 'one', 'trust', 'must', 'now', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'husband', 'thwarted', 'step', 'way', 'disappearance', 'guide', 'people', 'suddenly', 'do', 'know', 'Determined', 'find', 'husband', 'Ava', 'out', 'one', 'woman', 'vendetta', 'taking', 'down', 'anyone', 'responsible', 'disappearance', 'husband', 'race', 'time', 'one', 'will', 'leave', 'edge', 'seat', 'loving', 'minute', 'blow', 'Ava', 'delivers', 'quest', 'find', 'only', 'person', 'ever', 'loved', 'too', 'late']",N/A

1695330,AKCV2JKS24HI0,B00J2MPZQG,B.E. Lewis,"[1, 2]","You wouldn't think an action film could drag on, but it does! That in itself is a feat. Honestly I think the problem is all in the script and writing.. if Gina had a well-written script with an actual compelling storyline, she could probably carry a ""female Jack Reacher"" type of movie. This one is seems like a hastily thrown-together plot that isn't even well thought out. By the time it ends you don't really care about what happens; even the honeymoon couple aren't developed as characters at all. Gina's torturing and killing people seems odd when she's not even sure what happened to her husband... at least in Taken, Liam Neeson knew his daughter had been kidnapped. All Gina knows is her husband fell off a zip line and disappeared afterwards. Especially bizarre is her threatening a police officer's sleeping child, and then making the cop commit suicide, when all he was guilty of was giving her false information. I'm a Gina fan, but she really needs a good script to come her way, keep working on the acting (this is much better than Haywire), and before long she'll be a solid action star. I agree with the reviewer who said she could be the female Steven Seagal. Oh, it's also strange how much texting goes on in this film! Everyone is texting - the screen constantly goes to closeups of texts the bad guys are sending each other, texts Gina is looking at, and cell phone screenshots.

My problem with her movies are their endings. Haywire ended with a fizzle not a bang. Why did we not see her take the ultimate bad guy out and why did he not have a strong body guard presents so we could see some good action in the end? We were left to imagine her taking down the ultimate villain of the movie. O.K so that was Haywire, which was all-in-all a reasonably good movie except for the ending.Now In The Blood seemed to have run out of money and they just wrapped it up without much thought. The end fight scenes were below Gina. The ending was unrealistic. The bad guy never kills any of the snitches and people hiding her? The show was reasonable (not great) until it plummeted into c grade in the last 20 minutes.I have this movie in my cart for about a month now, because I really like Gina, but cannot get myself to order it because I keep remembering those awful last 20 minutes.Gina I know you are new to the Biz, but get a new agent and try getting some quality projects.

For a good three-quarters or four-fifths of the way through the film is a thoughtful meditation on violence only to give way to routine action formula.  John Stockwell's film recalls Sam Peckinpah the difference being that Peckinpah had the courage of his convictions trusting the audience and allowing his films to follow their logical conclusion.

Lee Zimmerman ""Trekscribbler (aka Ed)""","[2, 2]","As great action films are hard-to-find, even good one &#8211; your basic, run-of-the-mill actioner &#8211; are growing in scarce supply.  It could be because the dynamics of making these types of films almost require that screenwriters pad their scripts with some unnecessary baggage form-fitted for the high salary box office draws like Kevin Costner or Liam Neeson.  (This isn&#8217;t to say their films are bad; rather, it&#8217;s only to remind you that prior to their doing flicks of this variety they were probably no studio executives&#8217; first choice.)  Just when you thought the days of the musclebound hero were dead and buried, Gina Carano rises up, signs a few Hollywood contracts, and shows audiences once more what a true action hero used to look like every time we purchased our tickets.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Ava (played by the stunning Gina Carano) and Derek (Cam Gigandet) are newlyweds taking their Honeymoon on some tropical paradise accessible by boat from nearby Puerto Rico.  On the island, a young local named Manny (Ismael Cruz Cordova) promises to help them navigate the local hot spots, and they&#8217;re only too willing to take him up on the offer.  But after a chance accident on a zipline excursion leaves Derek fighting for survival, he mysteriously disappears without a trace from the local hospital.  Alone and with the police believing she may have participating in the man&#8217;s possible demise, Ava takes to the streets with one simple mission: find her kidnapped husband or die trying.First off, I&#8217;ve waxed on before about my love for hard-boiled literature.  (Yes, it IS literature, peeps.)  And &#8211; to my surprise &#8211; so very much of IN THE BLOOD&#8217;s characterizations worked on that same level.  For example, Carano&#8217;s Ava had a curiously secret upbringing, one where she was trained since coming-of-age by a father whose background is more than a bit mysterious.  What kind of training?  Training to defend herself.  Training to get out of tight places.  Training to kill, if that be the requirement.  Given so much of her youth was spent in some bombed-out ghetto style existence, those were skills she&#8217;d come to appreciate.After leaving those dark days behind, Ava continued to craft a lifestyle shrouded in secrets.  It&#8217;s clear that her father-in-law (the too-rarely-seen Treat Williams) doesn&#8217;t trust her &#8211; he even begins to suspect she had ulterior motives in the disappearance of his son &#8211; and he drops hints on more than one occasion that things about the woman just don&#8217;t add up.  While that may not function as character development for the latest Merchant Ivory snorefest, it works perfect for the world of hard-boiled prose, of which I have no doubt screenwriters James Robert Johnston and Bennett Yellin have familiarity.  (Johnston&#8217;s resume is light but he clearly shows some chops for the rough stuff while Yellin tends to have used his time writing on low-brow comedies.)This isn&#8217;t Shakespeare, and much of what&#8217;s needed to pull it off convincingly rests on Carano&#8217;s more-than-capable shoulders.  Also, there&#8217;s a final scene (a goodbye to Manny as Ava leaves the island) that plays out with some high level of smarm uncharacteristic to this type of movie.  The tension mounts as she&#8217;s surrounded by yet more people who don&#8217;t believe her, but all the time one thing remains certain &#8211; she&#8217;s going to find those responsible and make them pay in either pain or bloodshed &#8230; just as dear old dad would&#8217;ve wanted her to do.IN THE BLOOD (2014) is produced by Anchor Bay Films, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, Movie Package Company, MICA Entertainment, and a whole host of others (if you&#8217;re that die-hard about, then check out the film&#8217;s full listing over at IMDB.com).  DVD distribution is being handled via Anchor Bay.  As for the technical specifications, this smart little flick offers up some very high quality sights and sounds &#8211; the cinematography is a bit predictable at time, and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m working on a receiver failure (or not) but the dialogue by a few characters was a bit muddled.  Not too bad, but I thought it worth mentioning.  Lastly &#8211; if it&#8217;s special features you want &#8211; then this Blu-ray + DVD combo also sports a Digital HD Ultraviolet Copy as well as a behind-the-scenes short.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Pardon me if I some even remotely sexist, but it&#8217;s nice to see some talent of the female persuasion emerging on the scene to bring an all new level of machismo to the action genre.  I had the good fortune of watching Zoe Bell beat the stuffing out of folks recently in RAZE on home video, and now I&#8217;ve had the same great luck watching the hopelessly photogenic Gina Carano do the same.  IN THE BLOOD might not feed my guilty pleasure as solidly as did RAZE, but it sure whet the palate for more from this budding heroine.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Anchor Bay Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of IN THE BLOOD by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",4,Runaway Bride!,1401753600,"06 3, 2014",2014,5678,"['great', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'hard-to-find', 'even', 'good', 'one', '8211', 'basic', 'run-of-the-mill',

She does a great job considering what she's given to work with.  If she can keep doing stuff like she did in the first big fight scene and not let them turn it &#34;Hollywoody&#34;, great.  She is totally convincing when she can go &#34;no-holds-barred&#34; and gets the job done.  I hope she will always have input into the fight choreography so she isn't forced to use wires or do those stupid high kicks and stuff that the studios always seem to want.  It really trashes a movie.  I also like her girl-next-door kind of beauty.  It makes her seem approachable and even a little vulnerable.  That makes what she does in the fights even more amazing.  I've given up on Segal (long ago), Lundgren, and van Damme.  It's great to see Carano taking over.  I took off one star because Gina needs some training with firearms.

In this movie, you can definitely tell she is still a rookie with acting and that's ok. I think it just seemed worse because of the low budget of the film.3.

1695347,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B00J2MPZQG,Mantis,"[3, 3]","After seeing & enjoying Gina Carano's first starring vehicle, &#34;Haywire&#34;, I was looking forward to her next project.  Had I not approached it as a fan of martial arts I think I would've been quite fond of it.  It's not bad and is fairly well made, with Gina's acting coming along nicely.  No, she won't be nominated by the academy this year, but she's more than serviceable.Gina plays Ava, a girl raised by her father (Stephen Lang, &#34;Avatar&#34;), himself a low-level criminal, to be completely self-reliant.  After occupational hazard marks his demise, she spends the rest of her adolescence testing his methods.  Life changes when she meets Derek (Cam Gigandet, &#34;Never Back Down&#34;) in rehab and her life is given new meaning.  Despite the protests from his wealthy family, they get married.  While spending their honeymoon on an undisclosed tropical island near Puerto Rico, Derek disappears.  No one on the island seems to have a clue what happened to the dude, and his father (Treat Williams, &#34;Once Upon a Time in America&#34;) suspects that Ava is trying to cash in on the family fortune.I thought I was in for major disappointment when the opening brawl in a nightclub is shown entirely under the strobe-lights and nothing can be seen.  Though that was a problem that would not be repeated in the film, the short, one-sided nature of the ensuing fights was only of minor consolation.  As Ava realizes that no one is going to help her and that a few folks in town may know a little more than they're letting on, she decides to kick her investigation up a notch.  While Gina looks good doing this, not enough attention is placed on her fighting ability (isn't that why she was cast?) and most, if not all, of the fisticuffs looks like it could've been performed by anyone. That being said, there are still tense (and often extremely violent) moments of excitement.The supporting cast is well chosen, though we could stand a little more time from Stephen Lang, Treat Williams, and I suppose, even the seemingly unavoidable Danny Trejo (&#34;Machete&#34;).  Veteran character-actor Luis Guzman (&#34;Boogie Nights&#34;) as the police chief and Amaury Nolasco (&#34;The Rum Diary&#34;) as gang-leader Silvio help make up for it with great performances.  Rookie actor Ismael Cruz Cordova (&#34;White Alligator&#34;) also adds a bit of fun and mystery as Ava & Derek's friend Manny.The DVD from Anchor Bay is in English with some Spanish, with English or Spanish subtitles.  Widescreen ratio of 1.85:1.  Running time of 108 minutes.  Special Features include a &#34;making of&#34; documentary.  Directed by John Stockwell (&#34;Turistas&#34;).All-in-all this was a decent enough thriller.  Longer, more competently filmed fight scenes would've helped but I liked it well enough, even watching it twice.  The climax loses a bit of momentum through increased absurdity, more because of presentation than plot.  I still look forward to Ms. Carano's next project, though I think her particular set of skills could be more intelligently utilized.  3.5 out of 5 stars.2014",3,Keep me off of Caribbean zip-lines!,1402531200,"06 12, 2014",2014,3087,"['seeing', 'enjoying', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'first', 'starring', 'vehicle', '34', 'Haywire', '34', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'project', 'Had', 'not', 'approached', 'fan', 'martial', 'arts', 'think', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quite', 'fond', 'not', 'bad', 'fairly', 'well', 'made', 'Gina', 'acting', 'coming', 'along', 'nicely', 'No', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'nominated', 'academy', 'year', 'more', 'serviceable.Gina', 'plays', 'Ava', 'girl', 'raised', 'father', 'Stephen', 'Lang', '34', 'Avatar', '34', 'low-level', 'criminal', 'be', 'completely', 'self-reliant', 'occupational', 'hazard', 'demise', 'rest', 'adolescence', 'testing', 'methods', 'Life', 'changes', 'when', 'Derek', 'Cam', 'Gigandet', '34', 'Never', 'Back', 'Down', '34', 'rehab', 'life', 'given', 'new', 'meaning', 'protests', 'wealthy', 'family', 'get', 'married', 'spending', 'honeymoon', 'undisclosed', 'tropical', 'island', 'Puerto', 'Rico', 'Derek', 'one', 'island', 'have', 'clue', 'happened', 'dude', 'father', 'Treat', 'Williams', '34', 'Once', 'Time', 'America', '34', 'Ava', 'trying', 'cash', 'family', 'fortune.I', 'thought', 'was', 'major', 'disappointment', 'when', 'opening', 'brawl', 'nightclub', 'shown', 'entirely', 'strobe-lights', 'nothing', 'can', 'be', 'seen', 'was', 'problem', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'repeated', 'film', 'short', 'one-sided', 'nature', 'ensuing', 'fights', 'was', 'only', 'minor', 'consolation', 'Ava', 'one', 'going', 'help', 'few', 'folks', 'town', 'may', 'know', 'little', 'more', ""'re"", 'letting', 'kick', 'investigation', 'up', 'notch', 'Gina', 'good', 'doing', 'not', 'enough', 'attention', 'placed', 'fighting', 'ability', ""n't"", 'why', 'was', 'cast', 'most', 'not', 'fisticuffs', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'performed', 'anyone', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'still', 'tense', 'often', 'extremely', 'violent', 'moments', 'excitement.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'well', 'chosen', 'could', 'stand', 'little', 'more', 'time', 'Stephen', 'Lang', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'suppose', 'even', 'seemingly', 'unavoidable', 'Danny', 'Trejo', '34', 'Machete', '34', 'Veteran', 'character-actor', 'Luis', 'Guzman', '34', 'Boogie', 'Nights', '34', 'police', 'chief', 'Amaury', 'Nolasco', '34', 'Rum', 'Diary', '34', 'gang-leader', 'Silvio', 'help', 'make', 'up', 'great', 'performances', 'Rookie', 'actor', 'Ismael', 'Cruz', 'Cordova', '34', 'White', 'Alligator', '34', 'also', 'bit', 'fun', 'mystery', 'Ava', 'Derek', 'friend', 'Manny.The', 'DVD', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'English', 'Spanish', 'English', 'Spanish', 'subtitles', 'Widescreen', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'Running', 'time', '108', 'minutes', 'Special', 'Features', 'include', '34', 'making', '34', 'documentary', 'Directed', 'John', 'Stockwell', '34', 'Turistas', '34', '.All-in-all', 'was', 'decent', 'enough', 'thriller', 'Longer', 'more', 'competently', 'filmed', 'fight', 'scenes', 'would', ""'ve"", 'helped', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'even', 'watching', 'twice', 'climax', 'bit', 'momentum', 'increased', 'absurdity', 'more', 'presentation', 'plot', 'still', 'look', 'forward', 'Ms.', 'Carano', 'next', 'project', 'think', 'particular', 'set', 'skills', 'could', 'be', 'more', 'intelligently', 'utilized', '3.5', '5', 'stars.2014']",N/A

1695349,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00J2MPZQG,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","A few years ago I watched former ultimate fighter Gina Carano kick numerous ""A-List"" actor's butts in a film called ""Haywire.""  I loved the film and her in it.  After another supporting role in ""Fast & Furious 6"" she gets her first lead in this boilerplate ""B"" movie.  With a story similar to ""Taken,"" the just married Ava (Carano) and her new husband Derek (Cam Gigandet) head off to a Spanish speaking Caribbean Island.  The island is never named but it is surely the Dominican Republic (filmed in Puerto Rico).Raised by her criminal father (Stephen Lang), Ava was taught how to fight and survive in case he wasn't around anymore.  Shown in flashback, we see some of the difficulties Ava encountered.  Now she's happy and is on her honeymoon but has a wealthy and suspicious father-in-law (Treat Williams).  This subplot never makes any sense, but fortunately doesn't take up much time.  While at a local disco, one of the bad guy leaders (Danny Trejo) engages Ava on the dance floor.  When hubby moves in, he's taken out by local henchmen.  That switches on Ava, who goes into full battle mode.  This scene could have been terrific as Carano really knows how to fight.  But the scene is poorly edited and we are flooded with blinding disco lights.  Too bad.After things settle down, the next day the honeymooners decide to head out to the zip-line.  Derek falls and on the way to the hospital, he disappears.  Ava seeks help from the local police chief (Luis Guzman), but he seems reluctant to get involved.  So Ava takes her `certain set of skills' on the trail to find Derek.  Her character is the same one we see Jason Statham portray in just about every movie he's in.  The movie has a terrible script, the acting is pretty bad and much of it just doesn't make much sense.  Still watching Carano in action is fun enough for me.I watched this film on a perfectly acceptable Blu ray.  The transfer is 1080p as most are and the aspect ratio is 1.85:1 which will fill most screens.  The picture is full of color most of the time, as you might expect in a film shot in the Caribbean.  Several scenes come in various portable media including ""Go-Pro"" cameras, cell phones so there are certain limitations.  Flesh-tones are good, but black levels don't quite get black enough on occasion.  The audio includes a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless track.

Here she plays a woman with rough past growing up who is trying to create a better future with her new husband, played by Cam Gigandet.  After a posh wedding and some brief interaction with her new wealthy in-laws, she and her husband go to a Caribbean island for their honeymoon.  Things go awry, setting up the stage for Carano to show her fighting moves against some island tough guys while trying to find her husband.The premise is not very complicated, and the style of the film is that of a minimalist procedural.  There is enough characterization for us to find Carano credible in her role and empathize with her.  Carano has a strong, charismatic screen presence that keeps our attention on her.  There is no excessive dialogue, but what there is works to advance the story and is mostly believable.  There are a few things that happen in the story that don't always seem consistent for the characters, but these are minor defects that we accept since we know that the point of them is to set things up to allow Carano to show off her martial arts skills on screen.Overall this is a good film that I recommend to action film buffs.  Carano's performance as a tough-as-nails woman doing what needs to be done is the reason to see this movie.

1695358,A2JP0URFHXP6DO,B00J2MPZQG,Tim Janson,"[0, 1]","Let me just say right off the bat that Gina Carano, not Gal Gadot should be playing Wonder Woman in the Batman/Superman film.  She has the beauty, the physique, and action chops.  With that out of the way let&#8217;s turn to &#8220;In the Blood&#8221; which is Carano&#8217;s second lead feature after 2011&#8217;s surprisingly good &#8220;Haywire.&#8221;  Unfortunately things don&#8217;t go quite as well in this film but that can be attributed to a dull script from James Robert Johnston and Bennett Yellin.Carano plays Ava, a recovering drug user who marries wealthy Derek Grant (Gigandet), a fellow former substance abuser.  The pair head for a Honeymoon in the Caribbean to a tiny remote island which can only mean trouble.  They have a run-in with some local thugs at a night club including the ubiquitous Danny Trejo as &#8220;Big Biz.&#8221;  Ava has to rescue her husband, surprising him with her fighting ability as she mops the floor with the tough guys.  Now, the average guy might wonder where his wife acquired her butt-kicking skills but Derek blows it off as if he happened to discover a tattoo that he&#8217;d never seen before.  The only explanation we get for her skills are a few flashbacks to her as a young woman training with her father in a homemade dojo.  I love Danny Trejo and he&#8217;s much better as a villain than a hero but after his scene in the nightclub he promptly disappears until the last 10 minutes of the film and thus is all but wasted.The following day Derek is hurt in a zipline accident and taken to a local hospital.  When Ava reaches the hospital the nurse at the front desk claims that her husband never arrived there.  Ava desperately searches for her missing husband, getting no help from the local police chief (Luis Guzman).  In fact Ava soon comes under suspicion from the police and Derek&#8217;s family as having been involved in his disappearance.  Ava eventually finds her husband&#8217;s kidnappers and their reason for abducting him is one of the most inane plot devices I have encountered in a long time.  The poor attempt at building a backstory is completely bungled.  We&#8217;re shown brief flashbacks of a troubled you and her father murdered but nothing ever comes of it.In the Blood is at its best when Carano is allowed to do her thing and kick ass, and she does it extremely well.  As a mixed martial artist her fights in the film are more brutal and look less choreographed than other female action stars.  The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes are the reasons to watch the film.  The problem is the hour in-between.  Director John Stockwell, who helmed the awful &#8220;Seal Team Six: The Raid on Osama Bin Laden&#8221; gives Carano little to do in the middle.  She travels from point to point as if it&#8217;s a videogame and she&#8217;s trying to collect all of the pickups even if she doesn&#8217;t need them.  Carano&#8217;s lack of emotional range makes some of these dramatic scenes almost painful to watch, especially when Derek&#8217;s father (Treat Williams) accusers her of being responsible for his son&#8217;s disappearance and she can muster little more than a mumble as she sulks away.  This isn&#8217;t a knock on Carino as much as it is Stockwell and the writers who put her in a no-win situation.",3,With that out of the way let&#8217;s turn to &#8220;In the Blood&#8221; which is Carano&#8217;s second lead feature after 2011&#8217;s surprisingly good &#8220;Hayw,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",2014,3291,"['Let', 'just', 'say', 'right', 'off', 'bat', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'not', 'Gal', 'Gadot', 'should', 'be', 'playing', 'Wonder', 'Woman', 'Batman/Superman', 'film', 'beauty', 'physique', 'action', 'chops', 'way', 'let', '8217', 'turn', '8220', 'Blood', '8221', 'Carano', '8217', 'second', 'lead', 'feature', '2011', '8217', 'surprisingly', 'good', '8220', 'Haywire.', '8221', 'Unfortunately', 'things', 'don', '8217', 'go', 'quite', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'attributed', 'dull', 'script', 'James', 'Robert', 'Johnston', 'Bennett', 'Yellin.Carano', 'Ava', 'recovering', 'drug', 'user', 'who', 'wealthy', 'Derek', 'Grant', 'Gigandet', 'fellow', 'former', 'substance', 'abuser', 'pair', 'head', 'Honeymoon', 'Caribbean', 'tiny', 'remote', 'island', 'can', 'only', 'mean', 'trouble', 'have', 'run-in', 'local', 'thugs', 'night', 'club', 'including', 'ubiquitous', 'Danny', 'Trejo', '8220', 'Big', 'Biz.', '8221', 'Ava', 'rescue', 'husband', 'surprising', 'fighting', 'ability', 'floor', 'tough', 'guys', 'Now', 'average', 'guy', 'might', 'wonder', 'where', 'wife', 'acquired', 'butt-kicking', 'skills', 'Derek', 'off', 'happened', 'discover', 'tattoo', '8217', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'only', 'explanation', 'get', 'skills', 'are', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'young', 'woman', 'training', 'father', 'homemade', 'dojo', 'love', 'Danny', 'Trejo', '8217', 'much', 'better', 'villain', 'hero', 'scene', 'nightclub', 'promptly', 'last', '10', 'minutes', 'film', 'thus', 'wasted.The', 'following', 'day', 'Derek', 'hurt', 'zipline', 'accident', 'taken', 'local', 'hospital', 'When', 'Ava', 'hospital', 'nurse', 'front', 'desk', 'claims', 'husband', 'never', 'arrived', 'there', 'Ava', 'desperately', 'missing', 'husband', 'getting', 'help', 'local', 'police', 'chief', 'Luis', 'Guzman', 'fact', 'Ava', 'soon', 'suspicion', 'police', 'Derek', '8217', 'family', 'having', 'been', 'involved', 'disappearance', 'Ava', 'eventually', 'husband', '8217', 'kidnappers', 'reason', 'abducting', 'one', 'most', 'inane', 'plot', 'devices', 'have', 'encountered', 'long', 'time', 'poor', 'attempt', 'building', 'backstory', 'completely', 'bungled', '8217', 're', 'shown', 'brief', 'flashbacks', 'troubled', 'father', 'murdered', 'nothing', 'ever', 'it.In', 'Blood', 'best', 'when', 'Carano', 'allowed', 'do', 'thing', 'kick', 'ass', 'extremely', 'well', 'mixed', 'martial', 'artist', 'fights', 'film', 'are', 'more', 'brutal', 'look', 'less', 'choreographed', 'other', 'female', 'action', 'stars', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'last', '20', 'minutes', 'are', 'reasons', 'watch', 'film', 'problem', 'hour', 'in-between', 'Director', 'John', 'Stockwell', 'who', 'helmed', 'awful', '8220', 'Seal', 'Team', 'Six', 'Raid', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', '8221', 'Carano', 'little', 'do', 'middle', 'point', 'point', '8217', 's', 'videogame', '8217', 's', 'trying', 'collect', 'pickups', 'even', 'doesn', '8217', 'need', 'Carano', '8217', 's', 'lack', 'emotional', 'range', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'almost', 'painful', 'watch', 'especially', 'when', 'Derek', '8217', 'father', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'being', 'responsible', 'son', '8217', 'disappearance', 'can', 'muster', 'little', 'more', 'mumble', 'away', 'isn', '8217', 'knock', 'Carino', 'as', 'much', 'Stockwell', 'writers', 'who', 'put', 'no-win', 'situation']",N/A

1695360,A2A0FBLKJN4ZY5,B00J2MPZQG,W. freeman,"[2, 4]","Gina is very skilled, beautiful, and a nice person all around. Nothing really like she portrays in movies, I've watched many interviews with her. Very cool. Much like Jet Li, Steven Seagal, Juan Claude Van Dam, Chuck Norris etc. She is a B movie, straight to DVD kind of actress. In this movie she has a ""little"" more dialogue than in Fast 6 and Haywire, but that's not saying much. She does cry and show emotion pretty good as well. But the movie just drags along, first a typical honeymoon, then a barfight scence to set things up to go wrong. Then as seen in the previews (her hubby falls to his death). Then she seeks out to find out how and why. There are some creative moments in the film. But others just don't make sense, not to spoil anything but she wants all this revenge before she even knows whether or not her husband is actually dead. And she seeks it, and gets it, for the most part. But she's arrested, takes out cops, threatens the main policemans 8 year old daughter with a gun (while sleeping). Then goes off just killing everyone in site. She basically has no sympathy. Which is a little odd to watch. Especially certain seens where she actually tortures a few people.So basically it's a like a much more violent ""Taken"", but without just provocation. Once you reach the end of the film you're left asking, why did she do all this? Was it really that big of a deal? That is ""the twist at the end"", which seemed very trivial to me. And with a very drawn out ending. Danny Trajeo who was in the movie for like a total of 8 minutes seemed very pointless to me as well. He probably only filmed his parts for about an hour. So it's just the basic, I want revenge, even though I'm not ""sure"" exactly if I should be doing this type of deal/movie. At least that's what I took away from it. I think Gina Carano has much more talent, and should be cast in much better roles than just fight films. She would be ""one of the few"". But the way I see it she's paved this ""way of the bad A##"" image for herself. So that's what film makers are going to cash in on. That's why this is out only in very few theaters. And coming to DVD in just a few weeks. And Amazon Instant Watch. Haywire was ok as well, but not really outstanding either.

Alas I was totally disappointed. I suspected there was much to be desired in her acting ability from the first movie, but the action and movement overshadowed her lack. &#34;In the blood&#34; however had neither acting or decent action. The editing and poor photography made this a travesty! A few punches and kicks and all of a sudden &#34;dead guy&#34; It was a poor movie from every aspect. I didn't believe any of the characters from Treat Williams (although who ever believes him) to the new husband and the rest of the family.

And there is a twist near the end that is pretty different.  Danny Trejo's part is crowbarred into the film, which stinks.  Not developed well at all.  He is a Deus Ex Machina.  So why should you watch this action movie with a story that is far from perfect?Gina Carano.  When the action starts--and it starts often--she explodes onto the scene.  This movie demonstrates very well how effective MMA techniques are in a real fight.  Rarely over-the-top, but ALWAYS impressive and brutal.  From perfect elbows to leg kicks to armbars to ground-and-pound--this movie's action is exciting and realistic!  Wow!  Gina Carano is THAT good in EVERY action scene.  I promise.While Gina Carano is gorgeous, she is never objectified.  Her acting is very good, but a bit stiff and expressionless at times.  She is going to be the complete entertaining package when she masters acting.If you love action, you kind of HAVE TO rent this film.  Buying it is a different story.  Decide AFTER you see it.",4,"Not Perfect, But Gina Is",1401840000,"06 4, 2014",2014,1086,"['story', 'slow', 'parts', 'few', 'stupid', 'character', 'actions', 'bulk', 'very', 'good', 'twist', 'end', 'pretty', 'different', 'Danny', 'Trejo', 'part', 'crowbarred', 'film', 'Not', 'developed', 'well', 'Deus', 'Ex', 'Machina', 'So', 'why', 'should', 'watch', 'action', 'movie', 'story', 'far', 'perfect', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'When', 'action', 'often', 'scene', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'how', 'effective', 'MMA', 'techniques', 'are', 'real', 'fight', 'Rarely', 'over-the-top', 'ALWAYS', 'impressive', 'brutal', 'perfect', 'elbows', 'leg', 'kicks', 'armbars', 'ground-and-pound', 'movie', 'action', 'exciting', 'realistic', 'Wow', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'good', 'EVERY', 'action', 'scene', 'promise.While', 'Gina', 'Carano', 'gorgeous', 'never', 'objectified', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'bit', 'stiff', 'expressionless', 'times', 'going', 'be', 'complete', 'entertaining', 'package', 'when', 'love', 'action', 'kind', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'rent', 'film', 'Buying', 'different', 'story', 'Decide', 'AFTER', 'see']",N/A
