He wears many rings and medals, and two ivory-handled revolvers. He gives a speech on the need for winning. ""America will never lose a war."" [Was this from an actual speech?] They show North Africa, the Kasserine Pass in 1943 Tunisia. People scrounge for goods among the battlefield. Major General Bradley looks over the area to check the reports. He needs a tough tank commander to do better. Patton arrives to inspect the soldiers. The American forces had inferior equipment (no mention of less experience). Patton plans on more discipline for the soldiers.An air attack provides drama. Where is the air cover? A message tells of a planned attack by Rommel. [The British broke the German code and could plan ahead.] The Americans dig in to await the attack. [No air cover? The battle scene is staged to minimize the number of actors.] The Americans and British win. Where will they attack next? Patton has a plan to take Palermo in a flanking attack. He offers his respects to the Cardinal (he knows politics). Patton wants another attack behind enemy lines so he can capture Messina first. Later he visits an Army hospital and slaps a patient who appears to be unwounded. [In fact that soldier was suffering from malaria.] The Allies parade through Messina. Ike orders Patton to apologize for slapping a soldier; he does so.In Corsica Patton pays tribute to the Free French forces under Generals De Gaulle and Le Clerc. Ike has to fight the enemy and keep the allies together. Patton will take part in a deception designed to draw German forces to the Pas de Calais. Did he insult our Russian allies? [Are there forces out to get Patton?] Patton is given command of the 3rd Army for a flanking attack. Bradley explains the strategy to Patton, the target is the rockets launched against London. Patton notices the use of carts by the Germans, their end is near. [A shortage of oil and gasoline.] The Battle of the Bulge halts their advance. Patton's forces race to Bastogne to attack the enemy. Will prayer help? Clear weather brings air cover. Patton is cool at a victory celebration. What will he say? Does he guard his tongue? Is he out of his mind? [Did somebody think he outlived his usefulness?] ""All glory is fleeting.""After four decades I note how this film is padded to fill out its three hours. This is one film that isn't as impressive as when first seen. Did this film try to improve Patton's image? George C. Scott refused to accept his award for this film. Scott later starred in a sequel that provided another view of Patton but it wasn't as successful. People like a movie with a happy ending that makes them feel good. Your opinion may vary. This film glides over Patton's reactionary politics and presents him as a colorful character. What other general ever slapped a patient in a hospital?

440029,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6304935811,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 12]","Some films, no matter how great they `were', just don't hold up over time.  I'm sure that, at the time of its release, `Patton' was a stellar film.  In fact, I know it was.  The film won seven Academy Awards (although, I know of a recent Oscar winning film that wasn't stellar upon its release, so I guess the Oscar's are not the perfect judge of quality) and has been hailed as one of the best biographical war movies of all time.I don't know, to me, it just felt `cheap'.Despite a blisteringly good performance by George C. Scott (I really love this guy as an actor, for he can really do just about anything), the film falters for me in scope and construction.  While the development of Patton himself is quite good, I found that everything going on around him felt cluttered, sloppy, confusing, rushed and, well, cheap.And I totally understand the detractors that call this movie boring, for at nearly three hours it does ride at a slow pace for the most part.While I am not a huge fan of war films to begin with, I am a very big fan of the biopic and an even bigger fan of the slow, brooding character study.  Sadly, even my patience was tested in parts.  Some films really stretched themselves and delivered something that was `ahead of its time'.  `Patton' is the type of film that feels outdated by the time the decade was over.  It feels like a poorly made `Television Movie' to me, and that is never good.When you consider the types of war films that came out in the late 70's you have to wonder why this particular film wasn't...better.Still, George C. Scott is a marvel here, and his performance does elevate the film in many areas.  As much as I wanted to end my viewing early on many occasions, it was Scott who kept me glued to the television.  `Patton' is far from a great film (as one friend once said to me, great movies are the ones that `hold up' over time) but it sports an astonishing performance and does carry with it some intriguing history.  It is a film that is worth watching at least once.  I understand good and well that entertainment and the enjoyment it brings is purely subjective, and our own personal situations, emotional crutches and whatnot all play a big part in what we find enjoyable, moving and shapes what we consider masterpieces.  So, I totally understand why so many adore this film.I hope that you can understand why I didn't.",3,"It may not be a popular opinion, but it's mine...",1260835200,"12 15, 2009",2009,2373,"['films', 'matter', 'how', 'great', 'were', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'time', ""'m"", 'sure', 'time', 'release', 'Patton', 'was', 'stellar', 'film', 'fact', 'know', 'was', 'film', 'won', 'seven', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'know', 'recent', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'stellar', 'release', 'guess', 'Oscar', 'are', 'not', 'perfect', 'judge', 'quality', 'been', 'hailed', 'one', 'best', 'biographical', 'war', 'movies', 'time.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'just', 'felt', ""cheap'.Despite"", 'blisteringly', 'good', 'performance', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'really', 'love', 'guy', 'actor', 'can', 'really', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'film', 'falters', 'scope', 'construction', 'development', 'Patton', 'quite', 'good', 'found', 'everything', 'going', 'felt', 'cluttered', 'sloppy', 'confusing', 'rushed', 'well', 'cheap.And', 'totally', 'understand', 'detractors', 'call', 'movie', 'boring', 'nearly', 'three', 'hours', 'ride', 'slow', 'pace', 'most', 'part.While', 'am', 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'war', 'films', 'begin', 'am', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'biopic', 'even', 'bigger', 'fan', 'slow', 'brooding', 'character', 'study', 'Sadly', 'even', 'patience', 'was', 'tested', 'parts', 'films', 'really', 'stretched', 'delivered', 'something', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'Patton', 'type', 'film', 'feels', 'outdated', 'time', 'decade', 'was', 'over', 'poorly', 'made', 'Television', 'Movie', 'never', 'good.When', 'consider', 'types', 'war', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'late', '70', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'particular', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'better.Still', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'marvel', 'here', 'performance', 'elevate', 'film', 'many', 'areas', 'As', 'much', 'wanted', 'end', 'viewing', 'early', 'many', 'occasions', 'was', 'Scott', 'who', 'kept', 'glued', 'television', 'Patton', 'far', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'friend', 'once', 'said', 'great', 'movies', 'are', 'ones', 'hold', 'up', 'time', 'sports', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'carry', 'intriguing', 'history', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'least', 'once', 'understand', 'good', 'well', 'entertainment', 'enjoyment', 'purely', 'subjective', 'own', 'personal', 'situations', 'emotional', 'crutches', 'whatnot', 'play', 'big', 'part', 'what', 'find', 'enjoyable', 'moving', 'shapes', 'what', 'consider', 'masterpieces', 'So', 'totally', 'understand', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'adore', 'film.I', 'hope', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'did', ""n't""]",N/A

The audience sees how myopic and vainglorious he is in the world of militaristic affairs and how politically incorrect he can be at times. It becomes fascinating and fatalistic at the same time as the events unfold. Of course, this has ramifications for his standing in the upper echelons in terms of being granted the command and directive to lead all of the Allied forces to the heart of Nazi Germany.

I believe that this George C. Scott's best film.When watching the film, don't get too caught up in the fact that, from a historic stand point, it is not accurate.  The tanks and other equipment are more modern versions than what was actually used during World War II (to save costs, the producers employed the use of the Spanish Army for many of the battle scenes).  This is not a documentary, it is a dramatic re-enactment of General George S. Patton's career during the war.

440033,ALR35EFI69S5R,6304935811,"Barron Laycock ""Labradorman""","[52, 57]","When this movie was released, it was almost immediately recognized as one of the finest, most accurate and most sensational biographies ever filmed. The unique integration in ""Patton"" of such fine acting, such a wonderful  script, and the filming itself combined to make this a gorgeous film to  watch, be entertained with, and also learn from in terms of its historical  value as an absolutely superb depiction of a most controversial man and his  times. All that said, this is a movie best enjoyed with the kind of visual  clarity, terrific cinematography, and matchless Technicolor it offers by  way of DVD technology.George C. Scott gives the performance of a  lifetime as the ego-drive, brilliant, and iconoclastic Patton, marvel of  the U.S Army, a man the Germans are convinced is far and away the single  best General the Allies have, and they watch him convinced he is the only  logical centerpiece for American plans for the impending invasion of  Europe.  Of course, they didn't understand the politics of the day, or the  degree to which Patton was his own worst enemy. Yet the progress of the  story on the screen convinces the viewer of the accuracy of the German  command's judgments of him; he is at once bold, brilliant, and innovative,  willing to improvise as he goes along to seize the opportunity of a given  moment, attempting to grab hold of the ever-present chaos of the situation  to transform it into an asset he can employ to gain advantage and win the  engagement.Such men as Patton (and MacArthur and others) are uniquely  suited for war; they do not ordinarily fare well or survive with much  public acclaim during less extreme and bloodcurdling times. The fact that  Eisenhower, for example, succeeded so well as President is probably due  more to the fact that he was less a battlefield commander and leader of  ""desperate men in combat"" like Patton than he was a superb organizer and a  natural politician. The movie &quot;Patton&quot; is an investment in both  great entertainment and a colorful, dramatic, and educational video you can  share with your sons and daughters to help them understand better the  chaos, contradictions, and cruelties of war.

This segment alone is enough to convince viewers that Scott deserved his Oscar- even if he himself didn't want it. He gives a superlative performance as the hard-assed and fearless General who is the only US General truly feared by the Nazis: Ironic considering Patton  had his nose shot off by the Germans. The man thinks nothing of shooting fatigued pack horses and dumping them into a river because they no longer serve their purpose to him. But although he is referred to by his men as ""old blood-and-guts"" (""Our blood, his guts"") Patton still manages to hide an almost fatherly love towards them (the scene where Patton tends a wounded soldier in hospital and then reverts to his hard-nose self and begins beating up on the poor guy for being a coward. And later in fearless mode to one of his superiors ""I shaved very close this morning, in preparation of getting smacked by you"".The battle sequences are well staged. In fact not a single frame of PATTON's 2 1/2 hours that doesn't detract the viewer's interest. If high school history had been this interesting, maybe I would have passed.My only complaints with the movie: What's with the stupid intermission two-thirds of the way through the film?

440036,A2CIJJJA4ILD26,6304935811,"B. D. Pentecost ""Brodie Edwards""","[405, 427]","Very first thing!  There is only one version of Patton on Blu-Ray you should get if you want a proper transfer.  Follow this link if you're not already on the correct product:Patton [Blu-ray]If you're not sure you're linked on the correct one, it's the one with a full upper torso shot of Mr. Scott with the American flag hanging behind him.  That's the remastered version.  All versions with half his face off to the right with a gray/white background are the older, waxy transfer.Second thing.  To those who waited with me for the remaster, all I can say is WOW!  It looks beautiful.  Detail is strong and the image is once again alive.  You can find comparison screen shots of the two version over at blu-ray.com.  Their review of the remaster also explains their error in giving such high marks to the first blu-ray pressing of the film.Only read on if you're either bored or don't fully know what the deal is with the two different versions.Now that Amazon has combined all Patton reviews to be displayed on all versions of the film, I will sum up my original review of the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book Blu-Ray Edition to encompass a more, `in general' tone.  To those wondering why so many people found my review helpful, it was because I researched and found important information about that particular release and felt a duty to inform all future Patton Blu-Ray purchasers that the 40th Anniversary, Digi-Book edition was in fact the same, horrible, DNR mess that had been available on Blu-Ray for a few years prior, just in new packaging.  But the biggest reason for my review was that I knew (thanks to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits) there was a properly re-mastered version being worked on and I felt a need to inform people so that if they wanted a good transfer, they would need to wait a bit.  Now that my review is visible on all versions, I can see how it would frustrate people to read everything I had written, from the original review to all the updates on the progress of the re-master.  So I shall summarize and make it more appropriately broad in an attempt to be more helpful to everyone.Now, about the film.  Patton is a classic among classics.  This is perhaps one of George C. Scotts best performances of his career.  And although the film has many inaccurate accounts for the sake of artistic liberties (what true story film doesn't?), all the way to the end with the `all time' ox cart dodge, the performances and cinematography are what make this movie a timeless classic.  Yes, it is slow.  At least for today's ADD, plot line spoon fed, 3D with no actual depth loving audiences.  But to those who prefer story to gimmicks, I would call it ""paced"", and not slow.  This is a dialog heavy film.  Do not go into it thinking otherwise.  And it is long.  But not dull.  George C Scott even won an Oscar for his performance and famously rejected it stating that he did not feel he was in competition with other actors and had this to say about the Academy Awards, ""The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it.""...  This film is almost like a very well directed, greatly acted, stage production.  Accept the set pieces are amazing, real, and captured on a now rarely used 70mm film stock.  So if you are interested in a summed up version of who General Patton was and his incredibly important role in winning WWII, than this would be the film to watch.  So good in fact, that they've never attempted an actual remake of it...yet (studios, please don't).On to the Blu-Ray issues mentioned above.  If 50% of this movies awesomeness is the beautiful cinematography, than no one should be subject to a sub-par version of this film on the PQ front.  What I want to do here is give everyone yet another heads up.  At this time, the version linked above is the only version of Patton you should purchase on Blu-Ray.  All others, the original release a few years back, the 40th Anniversary Digi-Book edition, and even the copy in the 4-Pack War Movie collection, should be avoided at all costs as they are all the same, awful, waxy looking transfer that was done when few people fully realized what Blu-Ray should be used for in the HD market.In Blu-Ray's infancy, studios often tried to get rid of all film elements that made a movie look less ""HD"" by today's standards of things being shot digitally.  I believe they felt that if there was any grain or softness to a film, it would make people think it was not an HD master and possibly make people not want to jump to Blu-Ray.  The fact is, anything shot on film will have grain.  It's one of the many elements that give film a life and character of it's own.  And even though Patton was filmed on 70mm film, meaning a much finer grain structure than typical film stock, the studio decided to wipe all grain off of the image for the first pressing anyway (known as DNR, or Digital Noise Reduction).  DNR is why we get a `waxy' appearance on faces and other objects on screen on some Blu-Ray discs.  Much like a moving wax museum.  Much of the detail is lost due to this process as well.  I'm not sure why, but some people still like this.  But to film purists who want a movie to look as it looked while in the theaters, this is unacceptable.  Unless it's Pixar, people shouldn't look waxy.  This is exactly what happened with the original pressing(s) of Patton on Blu-Ray.Thankfully, not only have studios realized that Blu-Ray and an HD displays true role should be to accurately represent the original work as best as possible, but the complaints were heard about Patton as well and a re-master has been in the works for a few years now.  It was released on November 6th of 2012.  If you are looking for a version of Patton that is true to it's original intent and look, than that version is the only one you should get.Yes, this may have gotten long.  But trust me, not nearly as long as the original post, which I will be archiving in the comments section.And once again, if you're purchasing Patton on Blu-Ray, be sure it's this version and this version only:Patton [Blu-ray]P.S.

As far as performances go, George C. Scott exceeds all expectations in this role. You get the feeling while watching him that the actor indeed thought he was his character during his time on the set. His Patton is the epitome of passion, desire, will, and honor. Of course, true to life, he was a complicated figure and the film displays this aspect of the man as well. He was vainglorious and rash--attributes often expected, and forgivable in a general. Scott's impressive but so is the script. One of the nice things about this DVD is that Francis Ford Coppola gives a short intro in which he shares that he was the screenplay writer and also fleshes out a few circumstances around the making of The Godfather.

If you haven't seen it  at least ten times, then you are missing something. Scott dominates the  whole movie, of course, as Patton. A fierce fighting Amercian General in  World War II. So much so, in fact, that after the U.S. entered the war, the  Germans divided the Allied Forces into two groups. &quot;Patton&quot; and  &quot;Other&quot;. An aide of Patton's wrote a biography of his commander  and recommeded this movie as a distinct example of how Patton actually was!  A little understanding might enhance your enjoyment of the film after you  buy it from Amazon.com. &quot;Georgie&quot;, as his close friends called  him, was a bit of a child prodigy. In fact, you can leave out the  &quot;prodigy&quot; in some cases and leave it at &quot;child&quot;. He was  no doubt the most brillant general in World War II. In fact, he was slated  in this position when war broke out. Chief-of -Staff, General Marshall,  liked him generally. Ike was his buddy until things got out of hand. Watch  a man whole simply has everything it takes to end a war but he has one  simple flaw. The ability to be diplomatic and political. You will see how  one man can outguess, out-think, out-do, any other general. But his energy  has to be, sometimes ruthlessly, harnessed in order for him not to destroy  the political structure of his own country's offensive. We all ultimately  believe in Patton's view. Just get the job over with whether it be washing  dishes, mowing the lawn, or conducting the war. FDR and Ike were masters of  the other side of the coin. Shake hands with people you dispise. Befriend  those whom you have absolutely nothing in common with except mutual gain.  Cooperate with a country whose sole purpose is to dominate the world, and  proved that fact through the invasion of Norway before our entry. It's hard  to identify with a man who worships war. But I think that if we do so, we  might more actually perceive the smiling wolves who provided an arena of  pretense for the entire world. Side with Georgie and then vote in November.  Georgie couldn't abide the &quot;greasy spoon&quot; mentality of his  political comrades.  Perhaps you won't either after viewing this film  through a pair of glasses with clean lens.

The harder WE push, the more Germans we will kill. The more Germans we kill, the fewer of our men will be killed.""-George S. PattonIf one did not know that this quote was said by General George S. Patton on June 5, 1944, it could be taken that it was the from a cold-blooded, patriot with no respect for humanity-or at least the Germans. Fortunately, Patton was that, but he also had much more humanity and intellect in him than the Axis powers.Patton begins the chronicle of the General's exploits after the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. As Patton arrives at headquarters, he assigns Omar Bradley as his deputy, and warns him that there are going to be serious changes around the base. He reduces the breakfast time from two hours to fifteen minutes, and instructs all soldiers to wear helmets. He concludes that the reason they have lost the Battle of Kasserine is due to the lack of discipline, and installing it can give the soldiers the gravity of their situation.From the very onset it becomes clear that Patton respects his solider, but only the soldiers that fight fearlessly and selflessly for their country. He has no respect, and in some occasions condemns, the ""cowards."" To Patton anyone complaining of ""nerves"" on the battlefield or with self-inflicted wounds is a coward. These individuals do not deserve to be treated to the Army's medical service, as that should be reserved for the most fearless of soldiers who have given their life for their country with no hesitation. Patton is disgusted at these soldiers who complain about the cruelties of war, and treats them with reproach.As odd as it may sound that a General cannot comprehend his soldiers fears and worries, it must be stated that Patton is not in war due to obligation or simply to serve his country. As General Bradley points out, and Patton assents, he ""loves"" war, and WWII is the best incident where his ambition can be tested. Unlike many other Generals his outlook towards war is not an event that must be dominated so the peaceful times can roll, but simply an exciting time in history that he must not miss. WWII for Patton is what Woodstock must have been for hippies, a joyous occasion where talent, ambition, and motivation comes together and euphoria occurs. Simply look at the scene where Patton is guiding the tanks through the muddy banks. That scene exemplifies his love of the battlefield, the joy of commanding, and the passion of leading men in battle. World War II may be a curse and abominable incident for many, yet Patton's views this as a chance that occurs every thousand years. He treats war as if it is a football game, and he may not get another chance to prove himself. His view may be attacked because of his somewhat ludicrous outlook on war, but it must understood that not all men join the army out of a sense of honor or obligation-some actually find the experience quite electrifying.Patton's spirituality is one of the oddest parts of his attributes. When he is complimented that he would have made a great general for Napoleon had he lived in the nineteenth century, he argues that he WAS living at that time. Many of his guests are confused at this response, but guffaw anyway. Patton's belief in reincarnation is a big motif of the film, as well as his mention of important historic facts and events-such as the Battle of Zama. Patton is a history aficionado like no one else, and continually refers to previous battles in regard to the regions his troops will overtake. He recounts how these lands were once taken by the Athenians and other respectful ancient powers. Patton seems to envision that all previous rulers conquered and devoured on the battlefield, and now he will continue in their footstep -but this time in the name of the United States of America. As the Germans point out, Patton is a man of the past stuck in the twentieth Century evidenced by his famous quote: ""God, I hate this century. God, I hate the twentieth Century."" The opposition correctly predicts that Patton will invade Sicily because historians have shown that Sicily is the heart of Italy and Patton's ideology is interwoven with history.Patton's outspokenness usually got him in deep trouble, and often limits his position in the army. His dislike for the Russians and dislike of General Bernard Law Montgomery more than often earns him the scorn of the major politicians from back home. It is at times baffling to consider his courage in comparing the Democrats and Republicans to the Nazi's. Patton may have been controversial, at times exaggerating, but he was not necessarily incorrect in his assessments. Though never appearing in the film, Ike's relationship with Patton is an intriguing one. Even after all the controversies that Patton creates for himself, Ike still supports him; though there eventually came a breaking for Ike when the General's unsavory comments left no leeway of support from Ike or any other public figure. It is of note that Patton who once was superior to Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower, eventually became subordinate to both. Though Ike's swift rise to power was due to conditions unrelated to Patton, it can be stated that Patton's outspoken nature may have had some effect-though this wild speculation-in Omar Bradley outranking him. It cannot be overstated that however respected Bradley and Ike where in the eyes of the German's, it was only General Patton that they feared, and for good reason when we consider the losses that he handed the Germans.Not enough praise can be bestowed upon Screenwriter Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North's screenplay that is as wise and ageless as any other screenplay ever committed to film. Even though they won the Academy Award for best Adapted Screenplay, this screenplay is still understated in its clarity and rich dialogue. We can clearly discern that were wise enough to commit a certain portrait of Patton to film. Patton is so delicately written that besides being a grand portrayal of American's most successful and outspoken military man, it comes to life as an inspirational representation of accomplishing one's dreams. Patton loves the battlefield because he deems that fighting is the sole reason to live, and his dislike of cowards must be understood from this angle. He does not treat war as unfortunate due to the fact that he has trained all his life for war, for fighting, and conquering. This film with its grand screenplay, cinematography, and direction still is most renowned and praised due to George C. Scott's portrayal of the general. Anyone who has seen  Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb will be taken aback at Scott's controlled yet astonishing portrayal. Often stated as one of the best male performances captured on film, Scott not only gets the Patton's demeanor right, but he completes the harder task of translating the stressful situations that Patton experiences in an illuminating way. Patton does not attempt to show the situations of war, for that has been done countless time, but rather suffices in honoring the men, every one of them, through one figure.",5,"The General, with all

The version of the battle in the original movie was designed to show Patton's skill as a field commander, and it illustrated perfectly the tactic which Patton called, ""Hold him by the nose and kick him in the butt.""  This tactic was actually invented by Themistocles in the battle of Salamis in the second Greek war against the Persians.  It involves faking a frontal assault, then faking a rapid retreat to lure to enemy into a careless attack, then launching a surprise attack on the enemy from the side.  Each step of this tactic was illustrated in the movie: Patton's tanks attacked, then stopped and rapidly pulled back.  Seeing that, the Germans rushed forward full speed, not seeing Bradley laying behind a bank on the side.  Bradley then attacked.  Patton's tanks stopped and rushed forward again in attack.  The Germans were being hit from two sides, an untenable position.  They were severely damaged and those that remained retreated.Obviously, some later film editor was afraid the public would regard it as cowardice for the American tanks to stop and pull back as though running away.  This editor completely butchered the battle scene until all you have is a mishmash of explosions, cannons firing, etc.It is too bad that filmmakers and editors think the American public is so stupid that they won't be able to follow the logic of this classic battle tactic.

440053,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,6304935811,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[3, 4]","Nominated for ten Academy Awards, and winner of seven including Best Picture, Patton is one of the most inspirational and interesting biographies ever produced on the big screen. Cast in the title role, George C. Scott won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, but refused to accept the award because he didn't consider himself in competition with other actors. With brilliant direction, cinematography, visual effects, and an original musical score (by Jerry Goldsmith) - themselves all nominated for Academy Awards - Patton stacks up as one of the best films of all time from any genre...Patton follows the life of George S. Patton (George C. Scott), famous Allied tank commander from World War II. Beginning with his exploits in North Africa, Patton follows the career of this bombastic general through the D-Day invasion (in which he would act as a decoy), the Battle of the Bulge, and the liberation of Germany. Throughout the process, viewers are privy to the ongoing behind-the-scenes actions of a man famous for his temper and infamous among his peers for his insubordination.Along the way, Patton must learn to deal with his contemporaries, men such as General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden), and Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Michael Bates). Despite his display of military genius in the field of battle (garnering the fear of his German enemies), Patton is relieved from his post as Occupation Commander of Germany because of the many faults he exhibits. A military historian who believed he was destined for greatness throughout the ages, Patton loved war. In fact, once the war ended, he died within a few months when he was killed in a car accident...George C. Scott turns in a memorable performance as the large-than-life Patton. With an overpowering personality and a domineering will, George Patton led his men to victory in one of the most pivotal wars for freedom the world has ever witnessed. Politically-incorrect by every standard of today's measure, the real Patton wouldn't last a minute in today's military. Ironic, because that same military would acknowledge him as one of the greatest generals of its hallowed past! Nevertheless, Patton's legacy endures through our memories and through this film, and the lessons of his life continue to inspire people to this day (people who hopefully use a bit more tact and subtlety in asserting their desires)...Overall, Patton is a blockbuster film even by today's standards. Despite vast improvements in the realm of filmmaking, Patton (released in 1970) remains unrivaled in its portrayal of one of America's greatest heroes. The battle scenes are especially realistic, and decades before Saving Private Ryan, they vividly illustrated the serious horrors of war. One of the greatest films of the 20th Century, written about one of the greatest figures of the 20th Century, Patton is a definite must-see film for any serious aficionado of movies...The DVD Report",5,"Still, one of the best WWII films ever produced...",1113955200,"04 20, 2005",2005,2966,"['Nominated', 'ten', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'winner', 'seven', 'including', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Patton', 'one', 'most', 'inspirational', 'interesting', 'biographies', 'ever', 'produced', 'big', 'screen', 'Cast', 'title', 'role', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Leading', 'Role', 'refused', 'accept', 'award', 'did', ""n't"", 'consider', 'competition', 'other', 'actors', 'brilliant', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'visual', 'effects', 'original', 'musical', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'nominated', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'Patton', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'genre', 'Patton', 'life', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'famous', 'Allied', 'tank', 'commander', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'Beginning', 'exploits', 'North', 'Africa', 'Patton', 'career', 'bombastic', 'general', 'D-Day', 'invasion', 'would', 'act', 'decoy', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'liberation', 'Germany', 'process', 'viewers', 'are', 'privy', 'ongoing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'actions', 'man', 'famous', 'temper', 'infamous', 'peers', 'insubordination.Along', 'way', 'Patton', 'must', 'learn', 'deal', 'contemporaries', 'men', 'such', 'General', 'Dwight', 'D.', 'Eisenhower', 'General', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Field', 'Marshal', 'Bernard', 'Montgomery', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'display', 'military', 'genius', 'field', 'battle', 'garnering', 'fear', 'German', 'enemies', 'Patton', 'relieved', 'post', 'Occupation', 'Commander', 'Germany', 'many', 'faults', 'military', 'historian', 'who', 'believed', 'was', 'destined', 'greatness', 'ages', 'Patton', 'loved', 'war', 'fact', 'once', 'war', 'ended', 'died', 'few', 'months', 'when', 'was', 'killed', 'car', 'accident', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'memorable', 'performance', 'large-than-life', 'Patton', 'overpowering', 'personality', 'domineering', 'will', 'George', 'Patton', 'led', 'men', 'victory', 'one', 'most', 'pivotal', 'wars', 'freedom', 'world', 'ever', 'witnessed', 'Politically-incorrect', 'standard', 'today', 'measure', 'real', 'Patton', 'would', ""n't"", 'last', 'minute', 'today', 'military', 'Ironic', 'same', 'military', 'would', 'acknowledge', 'one', 'greatest', 'generals', 'hallowed', 'Nevertheless', 'Patton', 'legacy', 'memories', 'film', 'lessons', 'life', 'continue', 'inspire', 'people', 'day', 'people', 'who', 'hopefully', 'use', 'bit', 'more', 'tact', 'subtlety', 'asserting', 'desires', 'Overall', 'Patton', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'even', 'today', 'standards', 'vast', 'improvements', 'realm', 'filmmaking', 'Patton', 'released', '1970', 'unrivaled', 'portrayal', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'heroes', 'battle', 'scenes', 'are', 'especially', 'realistic', 'decades', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'vividly', 'illustrated', 'serious', 'horrors', 'war', 'One', 'greatest', 'films', '20th', 'Century', 'written', 'one', 'greatest', 'figures', '20th', 'Century', 'Patton', 'definite', 'must-see', 'film', 'serious', 'aficionado', 'movies', 'DVD', 'Report']",N/A

I remember seeing 'Patton' some years ago for the very first time and being instantly struck by how great it was. The movie inspired me to read as much material on General George S. Patton as I could. Patton the man and the film our two of my favorite things.George C. Scott really had the role of a lifetime here. He does not fumble the opportunity. He nails the part to perfection. One of the only differences between the two men was that Patton had a higher pitched voice. As his biographer Carlo D'Este once said, ""Patton would have loved to have a voice like George C. Scott's."" Scott's Patton is funny, mean, tough, fair, and moving. His portrayal of Patton's rage at the battle fatigued soldier is excellently played as is his stunned reaction at being put in the doghouse. His admission for his love of war over a smoking battlefield is a classic. Scott is great and he carries the picture. Karl Malden is a good foil for Patton as the legendary Omar Bradley. His Bradley seemed to me to be a little nicer than the actual Bradley was but it works for the movie. Oddly, Eisenhower is not depicted in the movie but his presence is felt throughout.You are riveted by this film from the beginning to the end. The entrance of Scott at the opening of the movie is one of the great introductions to a movie character in all of cinema.The DVD contains good picture and sound plus some interesting documentaries especially the 'History vs. Hollywood' that explains some of the creative licenses that were taken in the film.Highly recommended!",5,"""I love it.

440071,A3OEECMCM2T4KQ,6304935811,C. Middleton,"[1, 1]","~Patton~ played at our local movie theatre for more than six months. It was an immensely popular film upon its release, (1970) and continues to be one of the best biographical films of all time. There wasn't much to do in our small town on the weekends, so we just went to the movies. I must have seen this film over ten times during its long run, and I never grew tired of it. Years later, watching it again on video, reminded me how adept Franklin Schaffner was at making the Epic, which seemed to be the fashionable genre during the 60's and 70's. The list of his achievements includes, ""The Boy's from Brazil"", ""Papillon"" and ""Nicholas and Alexandra"". All great pictures, all great stories, which have that particular Schaffner style: epic-like, professional, and memorable with a lot of class.It is common knowledge that George C. Scott won the Oscar that year for best actor and declined the accolade for political and artistic reasons. This proved to be a significant turning point in his career; in fact his career seemed to go down hill after that, and he never fully recovered. This was unfortunate because Scott's performance in Patton is a work of pure genius, and he deserved to go on to do more high profile parts. For a lot of us, when we think of the historical character, General George Patton, we think of the actor, George C. Scott. The film and Scott's performance have become our historical reference point for the time and the man. When I think of the Seventh and Third armies during WW2, I visualize the actor in the Schaffner film standing in his jeep barking orders and inspiring his men to carry on against impossible odds. And that's the beauty of this film; it is accurate both historically and biographically. Of course, artistic license is taken occasionally, but for the most part, according to most WW2 historians, the film is true to the mark.This is not so much a war film but a story about a leader whom despite insurmountable obstacles, inspired men to great heights, achieving the near unattainable. Patton was an educated man from a distinguished military family, who viewed the world from an historical perspective - `old blood and guts' believed he was part of world history, an immortal soul that fought against the Romans, and later, was part of Napoleon's army that forged into Moscow in the early 19th century. Patton was a believer in reincarnation- the theory that knowledge can be `remembered', because the soul or mind has passed through a previous series of bodied and disembodied states. Whether this notion is true or not, Patton believed he had the accumulative knowledge from past lives and used this knowledge during his command in WW2. At the end of the film, one of the German characters comments that Patton was an anachronism, the romantic warrior of times passed, whom without a war to fight, would perish. This was certainly true. George Patton knew his purpose and destiny, and that was to lead men into battle.Everything about this film is first rate.",5,Romantic Warrior of times passed...,1057795200,"07 10, 2003",2003,3013,"['~Patton~', 'played', 'local', 'movie', 'theatre', 'more', 'six', 'months', 'was', 'immensely', 'popular', 'film', 'release', '1970', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'biographical', 'films', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'much', 'do', 'small', 'town', 'weekends', 'just', 'went', 'movies', 'must', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'ten', 'times', 'long', 'run', 'never', 'grew', 'tired', 'Years', 'later', 'watching', 'again', 'video', 'reminded', 'how', 'adept', 'Franklin', 'Schaffner', 'was', 'making', 'Epic', 'seemed', 'be', 'fashionable', 'genre', '60', '70', 'list', 'achievements', 'Boy', 'Brazil', 'Papillon', 'Nicholas', 'Alexandra', 'great', 'pictures', 'great', 'stories', 'have', 'particular', 'Schaffner', 'style', 'epic-like', 'professional', 'memorable', 'lot', 'class.It', 'common', 'knowledge', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'won', 'Oscar', 'year', 'best', 'actor', 'declined', 'accolade', 'political', 'artistic', 'reasons', 'proved', 'be', 'significant', 'turning', 'point', 'career', 'fact', 'career', 'seemed', 'go', 'down', 'hill', 'never', 'fully', 'recovered', 'was', 'unfortunate', 'Scott', 'performance', 'Patton', 'work', 'pure', 'genius', 'deserved', 'go', 'do', 'more', 'high', 'profile', 'parts', 'lot', 'when', 'think', 'historical', 'character', 'General', 'George', 'Patton', 'think', 'actor', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'film', 'Scott', 'performance', 'have', 'become', 'historical', 'reference', 'point', 'time', 'man', 'When', 'think', 'Seventh', 'Third', 'armies', 'WW2', 'visualize', 'actor', 'Schaffner', 'film', 'standing', 'jeep', 'barking', 'orders', 'inspiring', 'men', 'carry', 'impossible', 'odds', 'beauty', 'film', 'accurate', 'historically', 'biographically', 'course', 'artistic', 'license', 'taken', 'occasionally', 'most', 'part', 'according', 'most', 'WW2', 'historians', 'film', 'true', 'mark.This', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'war', 'film', 'story', 'leader', 'whom', 'insurmountable', 'obstacles', 'inspired', 'men', 'great', 'heights', 'achieving', 'near', 'unattainable', 'Patton', 'was', 'educated', 'man', 'distinguished', 'military', 'family', 'who', 'viewed', 'world', 'historical', 'perspective', 'old', 'blood', 'guts', 'believed', 'was', 'part', 'world', 'history', 'immortal', 'soul', 'fought', 'Romans', 'later', 'was', 'part', 'Napoleon', 'army', 'forged', 'Moscow', 'early', '19th', 'century', 'Patton', 'was', 'believer', 'reincarnation-', 'theory', 'knowledge', 'can', 'be', 'remembered', 'soul', 'mind', 'passed', 'previous', 'series', 'bodied', 'disembodied', 'states', 'notion', 'true', 'not', 'Patton', 'believed', 'had', 'accumulative', 'knowledge', 'past', 'lives', 'used', 'knowledge', 'command', 'WW2', 'end', 'film', 'one', 'German', 'characters', 'comments', 'Patton', 'was', 'anachronism', 'romantic', 'warrior', 'times', 'passed', 'whom', 'war', 'fight', 'would', 'perish', 'was', 'certainly', 'true', 'George', 'Patton', 'knew', 'purpose', 'destiny', 'was', 'lead', 'men', 'battle.Everything', 'film', 'first', 'rate']",N/A

It is a film that, while it's clearly not a great film, does not offer up an obvious reason. It starts off brilliantly, with Patton's famous address to the film audience, and then, well, becomes, in many ways, a routine biopic- at least when it's not about Patton directly, for George C. Scott owns the screen like few actors ever before him had. No, it's when we see other characters, or the big battle scenes, that the film becomes pedestrian. And that 20% or so of pedestrian film lowers the rest of the film's inarguable greatness to merely near-great status.Patton is not a great film, but in its flaws it delineates much of what a great film can be, and just how little of that needs to stem from the idea of a visionary or an auteur. As such, and along with Casablanca, it stands as one of the great arguments against the notion that films of quality must be wrought from the power and inspiration of a singular source. Franklin Schaffner, in fact, is proof that great art can come from people who are not gifted with innate greatness, just as the real General George S. Patton proved the opposite can also be true, and the two ideas not mutually opposing. As for the film, watch it for Scott's performance, watch it for a sense of American history (pro and con), and watch it because it's great entertainment, if not great art. Not all art need core into one's soul, sometimes pricking the flesh is enough.

Patton, probably the most famous military men of World War II.  Over the years, better DVD transfers of this film keep coming out and now we have a great Blu-Ray version. It just gets better and better!How much of this story is fact and how much is fiction, I don't know. Knowing Hollywood and knowing when this was made - during the heyday of the anti-war (Vietnam) movement - I have my suspicions but  WWII buffs I've talked to pretty much  back up this film.  Whatever political bias a filmmaker might have, Patton made for a good movie subject anyway and the story is interesting all the way, thanks to the acting of George C. Scott, who was astounding as Patton. He gives us one of the more memorable performances ever by an actor.Not only is Scott's acting superb, the widescreen photography is also good. Thank goodness DVDs came out so films like this could be seen in the aspect ratio in which they were filmed.

The subject of the movie, George Patton, is a hero to many, but is also unpopular with some, as he was unapologetically pro-American rather than internationalist, and he took political incorrectness to the level of an art form.  Patton remains a controversial figure.George C Scott, in a brilliant performance, brings Patton to life in this inspiring film.  The script, written by Francis Ford Coppola, features the famous beginning scene of Patton giving a speech to his men.  Also highlighted are Patton's penchant for flamboyant uniforms, his strongly religious side, his avid reading of military history, his acts of brazen boldness in the face of adversity (such as standing in the open and shooting at a plane straffing his postion with a handgun), and his ongoing run-ins with the officers above him whom he views as mere politicians.The action sequences are perhaps a bit dated and unconvincing in terms of realism, which is unfortunate as a sense of verisimilitude would have allowed a more vivid contrast between Patton's enthusiasm for battle with the real life horrors of combat.This film is inspirational, especially now.

I believe the light shed on him showed that he cared for the men who gave 110% for him and his country yet loathed and despised a man for his apparent weakness to fake injury or show any sign of what he called 'cowardness'.Unfortunately, men like these are bound to have faults. His were apparent. All to eager to mouth-off to everyone and anyone more often than not got him into trouble.

Firstly in the terrific script by a young Francis Ford Coppola and a later assist by Edmund North.  By focusing on George S. Patton and explaining the contradictions that were the man Coppola and North have crafted a portrait of a warrior whose actions would deceive you into thinking he was a warmonger.  Secondly you have an absolutely spellbinding performance by George C. Scott.  Scott has you mesmerized throughout and your eyes never leave him despite the bombast that surrounds him.

440086,AECVYXIL9791R,6304935811,David C. Read,"[11, 13]","This cinematic character study benefitted from the perfect casting of George C. Scott in the title role.  There has seldom been a more remarkable marriage of an actor with a role.  For most people, George C. Scott is George S. Patton, and George S. Patton is George C. Scott.  The result is a great film.  AFI ranks it at number 89 on their list of the top 100 American films, but that is a gross injustice.  The film deserves to be in the top 50, at least.Viewing this again, I noticed an interesting fact: Dwight D. Eisenhower is never on the screen, despite the fact that in real life Ike and Patton were good friends, met frequently and occasionally stayed up all night talking things out.  In the movie, Ike's thoughts are communicated by letter, or through Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) or Ike's chief of staff, Gen. Bedell Smith.  This was a clever tactic, however.  Since Ike and Douglas MacArthur were arguably the only two American generals who emerged from the war more famous than Patton, having Ike onscreen might have been distracting.  There is one star in this show, and it is Patton.This movie tells the story of how Patton, an authentic military genius--perhaps the only one to emerge from U.S. military during the war--was not utilized as well as he should have been, because he was a miserable politician.  It makes you wonder, as did a previous reviewer, whether a man like Patton, a ""pure warrior"" as the Germans so correctly labeled him, could even be promoted very high in today's bureaucratic, politically correct army.  As Patton himself wrote, ""Men, even so called great men, are wonderfully weak and timid.  They are too damned polite.  War is very simple, direct, and ruthless.  It takes a simple, direct, and ruthless man to wage war.""  If timid, weak, and polite men were a problem in WWII, and this film shows that they were, think how bad the problem is today.  Thank God we're the only superpower left, and that we're so much stronger than all the other nations that we'll never again need a man of Patton's calibur.On the technical side, this disc looks great.  The movie was one of only two movies shot in Dimension 150, a camera that actually captured 150 degrees, an enormously wide angle, and even the edges are perfectly focused.  The letterbox, widescreen format is the only acceptable version, and the larger the screen the better.  The sound is a bit spotty, with dialogue difficult to hear without being blown out of the room by sound effects accompanying tanks and planes.  Best to watch with the remote in hand.  I noticed that the 5.1 soundtrack worked alot better on my system than the dolby surroundsound.There is a second disk with the excellent Jerry Goldsmith sound track and a ""making of"" documentary.  The documentary is very weak.  We hear audio clips from George C. Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner, but they are not interviewed onscreen.  If it was going to be a tribute to Schaffner, as it purported to be, he should have had plenty of screen time, and they should have mentioned (and shown clips of) his other works, such as Planet of the Apes.  Worst of all, we are treated to Oliver Stone's lunatic ravings about how ""Patton"" indirectly caused the Cambodian genocide.  Good grief! If you have only 45 minutes of material, make a 45 minute documentary.  It wouldn't surprise me if this is why future editions of this DVD have dropped the second disc altogether.

440089,A3MAZM138KFVOW,6304935811,D. Blackdeer,"[7, 8]","1970 hit movie and Best Picture academy award winner about General George S. Patton Jr. in World War II.  George C. Scott, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the famous general, portrays Patton from his entry into the war with II Armor Corps in North Africa to victory in Europe with the 3d Army.  Patton's triumphs and controversial incidents are covered in this feature and provide entertaining insight on this man whose name is almost synonymous with World War II.  While Patton rests in the elite ranks of other famous leaders, his flamboyant personality sets him apart from most and it is Scott's impressive capture of this that makes the movie shine.The movie is generally accurate.  Patton is credited with taking command of the II Armor Corps at a critical time just after a brutal defeat to the German Army in North Africa, and leading it to victory shortly afterward.  Patton advances to command of the VII Army and is successful in Sicily.  During the Sicily operation, Patton slaps a soldier in a field hospital for perceived malingering, resulting in his relief from command.  Eventually he's reinstated to command of the 3d Army in France and leads the breakout from Normandy when Allied forces were bogged down in the infamous hedgerows.  The most famous event occurs when he anticipates the German's Ardennes Counter-offensive, more famously known as the ""Battle of the Bulge,"" and miraculously turns the 3d Army north in little time to defeat the Germans.There's artistic overplay of some historical details for dramatic effect such as being portrayed as almost running operations by himself when in fact he had talented staff and commanders who advised him well and carried out his orders.  A very interesting scene for speculation is after his fuel supplies have been redirected in 1944 to the invasion of the Netherlands [portrayed in the 1976 feature ""A Bridge Too Far""] he is standing on the scorched earth of a recent tank battle and remarks to his aide that he could be in Berlin in ten days.Overall an epic picture and one of a kind.  Other projects have attempted to follow this formula, but none came close to what was achieved in this movie.

If it were not for all the Nazi films of their attrocities, we  have seen them all.  Howver, had we seen films of the Japanesse atrocities in China, or Mao , or the death by starvation of many millions more of Ukranians, ethnic Germans living in Russia, or Jews ( Trotsky being the most famous Soviet Jew, who was killed shortly after Stalin had to behave himself getting rid of his political enemies and taking over Eastern Europe.  Patton was the American's greatest General during WWII, although MacArthur could be argued to be the best. His problem with today's worshipers of FDR and Truman, was that he was a potential political rival.  Bill Maudlin, the favorite cartoonist of Stars and Stripes hated Paton because he was a General whose philosphy clashed with the civilians whom he had to make into soldiers. The famous slap of the shell shocked soldier was not as bad as the countless mistakes caused by inferior generals who caused their lives to be lost.  Patton's slap was not fatal, he was not a social worker who knew or cared much for battle fatique.  A lot of soldiers caused self inflicted wounds. If Patton allowed such actions, indeed, if any General allowed such actions, Hitler would never been defeated.  That Patton or MacArthur were not perfect men, is not debatable. Howver, General Bradley, the ""soldiers's soldier lived to write his own history. He never slapped a soldier, but he probably cost more lives to be lost than Patton or MacArthur.  And as for Patton's negative remarks about Stalin, as we look back in hindsight, was Eisenhower, Bradley or FDR correct in thier misjudgement about Communism and Stalin.Hollywood seems to forget that Hitler was in power for 13 years, and was more or less elected into office.  Stalin was a Dictator for half a century, and became our enemy. Thanks to Hollywood, Hitler has become the villan of the century, while Stalin somehow comes in second as the Devil of the 20th Century. yes, the Nazi death camps were horrible, but were they any worse than those of the communists? We just do not have films, nor were the Western Allies allowed to see the communists attocities.  This is not deny the ridiculous arguments made by Iran, that the Holocaust did not exist. But it is a shamefull error to ignore the fact that Stalin started the war against the West, and stole our secrets fo half a century.

440096,A11PTCZ2FM2547,6304935811,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[2, 4]","The complexity of General George S. Patton, Jr. is mind-boggling.  A relentless student of war.  A fierce competitor, strategist, and antagonist.  Arrogant, ruthless, and egomaniacal.  A deep, unwavering love and commitment for the men under his command.  Brash and abrasive, he was politically incorrect before anyone knew what political correctness was.Director Franklin J. Schaffner depicts all of this complexity (and more) in his epic masterpiece, PATTON.  And George C. Scott delivers the title role brilliantly, a role that defined this distinguished actor's career.PATTON is not propaganda:  it is a compelling look at a larger-than-life American hero, warts and all.  Brilliant as Patton was, he tended to be his own worst enemy, from slapping a soldier he accused of cowardice to jeopardizing his battalion through barren Sicily because he wanted to arrive in Messina ahead of Field Marshal Montgomery's forces.  Patton knew the enemy well, knew how to defeat it--he simply could not deal with the bureacracy of the Allied command, to his detriment.  Demoted, muzzled, he was kicked to the sidelines of World War II until General Eisenhower called him back into battle during the late stages of the conflict.  Upon returning, Patton (""Old Blood 'n Guts"") performed masterfully, enhancing his icon status.As the war concludes, the viewer is drawn into Patton's passion to continue marching east, into Russia.  What would have happened had the British and Americans followed Patton's advice and defeated a rundown and tired Russian army?  A Cold War averted, or a cataclysmic nuclear nightmare?  The viewer can only wonder.Karl Malden as humble and modest General Omar N. Bradley--the antithesis of Patton--is equally brilliant; Jerry Goldsmith's musical score is haunting yet superb.

It is easy to form impressions of Patton while watching this movie: A narcisstic Patton fixated on his image in the mirror while getting ready for his first battle with German forces; a sarcastic playful Patton who replies ""Every Goddamn day"" to the question of his daily Bible reading habits; A self-absorbed Patton who must have his beach landing in Sicily refilmed many times; an insecure Patton who must beat Montgomery to Messina to prove his manhood; Patton as a brilliant military historian and tactician; Patton's belief in reincarnation and in personal destiny; Patton's antagonisim with authority while expecting his troops to accept his unconditionally; a Patton unable to control his emotions in the slapping of the soldier; Patton's pride of his troops on the March to Bastogne; Patton's belief in the intervention of God in human affairs (the asking of a ""weather prayer"" to clear the skies in order to make an assault upon the German forces at Bastogne); Patton as a 16th century warrior caught up in modern times.The cinematography and the acting in this movie are brilliant and it will no doubt endure as one of the best war movies of all time. One can probably say without doubt that Patton would find it difficult to function in the military of the 21st century, with its accountability to the press and its extreme emphasis on minimization of casualities.

Pauzer,"[1, 3]","A daring film enterprise at the height of the anti-war and anti-military sentiment in this country, the film seemed to satisfy those who supported the military and those opposed to it. George C. Scott embodied Patton fascinating both audiences who seemed transfixed with a fine script and superior performances of all players. Patton's genius was praised and his neuroses were exploited by those who felt he personified military immorality.Several viewpoints of Patton' personality and leadership are explored. His staff seem sychophantically loyal, and his soldiers appear to love him or hate Old Blood and Guts (Our blood, his guts)! Eisenhower's chief of staff Bedell Smith couldn't stand Patton, and Patton had a running competition and animosity for Bernard Law Montgomery. Karl Mauldin, plays Omar Bradley who first serves as his assistant division commander and then his superior. Bradley is portrayed as the benevolent and unassuming general who challenges the morality and military wisdom of Patton's decisions.The Germans seem to be unanimous in their esteem for Patton's audacity and military prowess. When Patton is relieved of his command for slapping a soldier, he is assigned to Sardinia, then Malta, then Cairo, and finally to England opposite the Pas-de-Calais where the allies set up a fictitious army around him. The Germans cannot believe that the best allied commander would actually be relieved for slapping a soldier, and they actually moved troops around the Mediterranean in anticipation of Patton attacking in Sardinia, through Greece, and at the Pas-de-Calais.Standing at 6'1,"" George C. Scott seemed better at Patton than Patton did who matched him in height but had a high-pitched voice. Scott played up Patton's lack of verbal impulse control, his iron discipline (he was famous for fines), a lack  of patience with subordinate officers, and for slapping a soldier. (Actually, he slapped two). The viewer gets the impression that Patton is a neurotic military genius who is willing to sacrifice his troops to satisfy his vainglory and destiny. His performance is so effective that people will proably remember Scott as Patton rather than Patton as Patton.Detractors of this movie say that Patton was far more caring of his men than the script allowed. He was liberal with passes, ensured that mail arrived regularly, and that showers and hot food were provided more often than in any other command. He only relieved one general for cause as opposed to Bradley who relieved several. He was always found in front of his men rallying them from the side of the road or walking among them offering us an impression of a man whose bark was worse than his bite. There is no doubt that he instilled pride in his troops and made them believe they were invincible against any enemy.In spite of the movie's detractors, everything about this production is phenomenal and George C. Scott in a defiant Patton personna, refused the Oscar for best actor that Ryan O'Neil panted for in ""Love Story."" (Well, love is never having to say you're sorry). It has withstood the test of time as being an all-time military classic.The speech he gives at the beginning of the film is a compilation of many of the salty and foul-mouthed expressions he made over his career.

This movie is fully deserving of all 8 of the Oscars that it won and is not only among the top 5 war movies that I've ever seen but is also among the top 5 biopics that I've ever seen.Patton is shown, warts and all, with little attempt made at trying to sugar coat his colourful personality although this movie gives us a chance to see the other side of the story that we get of the man from the sensationalist press of the time.  Having served in the military myself, I actually fully appreciated what he did to the cowardly soldier and I know I wouldn't have apologised if it was me but Patton saw the bigger picture and knew that he was needed to continue achieving greater things and so did what he had to which really impressed me.  Although the film is almost 3 hours in length, I didn't feel it as that movie is just that good.As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality is just excellent.  The THX Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround option makes the sound quality very good and I couldn't easily find any imperfections with the picture quality making me thoroughly satisfied with this dvd version.  Although there are no special features worth mentioning, the picture and sound quality more than make up for this.  I can only imagine how much better the Blu-ray version of this film will be given that it is already so good on this standard version.  I also appreciated the Anamorphic widescreen effect which ensured that only about a fifth of my widescreen was blacked out unlike the pure letterbox format which means I'd have to squint as only half my screen is utilised.  I understand that different people have different opinions about the various formats but for me anamorphic works well enough.This is a great movie and the dvd is equally as good; great film, great picture and sound quality albeit no special features save an audio essay on Patton's life still make this a great value purchase.Recommended.Updated 6 June 2011:As Amazon will not let me review this separately, I'll have to append this here:  the blu-ray version of this great film is certainly worth the double-dip.  As good as the picture quality was on the dvd I reviewed above, 1080p actually improves upon it on this version.  The sound quality in DTS HD 5.1 surround is excellent too and is also an improvement over the dvd.  The special features aren't much to shout about and is not an improvement over that of the dvd but the combined improvement of both the picture and sound qualities makes this a worthy upgrade.Highly recommended!",5,Great War Movie!

440122,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,6304935811,Godly Gadfly,"[8, 10]","Don't be mistaken: this classic war movie is not so much about war as it is about a man: General George S. Patton, arguably America's greatest Second World War combat general.  Based on two books about Patton (""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph"" by Ladislas Farago and ""A Soldier's Story"" by General Omar Bradley), the movie explores the war within his soul, and the temperament that was his undoing and yet brought him unprecedented success. Limited to his military career between early 1943 and late 1945, it's more of a character study than a biography.  But with a running time close to three hours, it's a character study with tremendous depth.Several aspects of his character are highlighted.1. Patton was fiercely competitive.  His race to beat British Field Marshall Montgomery to Messina and then to Berlin becomes a prime motivator for success, even if he needs to sacrifice men to achieve his personal ambitions.2. Patton loved war and thrived on the heat of battle.  While his compatriot General Omar Bradley did his job because he was trained to do it, Patton did it because he loved it. ""I love it, God help me, I do love it more than my life."" Patton had no political ambitions, and his only fear was that the war would have no role for him: ""All I want to do is command an army in combat."" As his German opposites observed, ""The absence of war will kill him.""3. Patton was a passionate military historian.  His love for military battles of the past constantly becomes evident: ""Patton is a 16th century man, a romantic warrior lost in contemporary times.""4. Patton was intensely religious.  He believed in both God and reincarnation, and was convinced that the lines of history were in place for him to achieve great things, and that God would enable him to fulfil his destiny - ""The last great opportunity of a lifetime and I'm left out of it? God will not allow it to happen.""  Yet his fierce religious fervour towards God was juxtaposed by his profanity towards men.  He frequently blasphemed, one incident in particular bringing out these conflicting qualities, when in reply to a question about the regularity of his Bible reading, Patton remarks ""Every God-damned day.""  It's been said that the raw language typical of Patton is even toned down in the movie (he supposedly once said ""You can't train a platoon without using profanity"").  Yet his inclination toward profanity is not excused, but is presented as part of a larger problem he had in controlling his tongue.5. Patton was inspirational.  He knew it was natural for soldiers to fear battle, and combated this with a fierce military discipline that made the soldiers fear him instead.  ""They'll lose their fear of the Germans ... I hope to God they never lose their fear of me.""  ""I won't have cowards in my army.""  The inspiring and bloodthirsty monologue that opens the movie with Patton dwarfed by the American flag is unforgettable: ""No bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country.""6. Patton himself lacked the discipline he expected of his soldiers.  His moments of lax self-control led him to say and do things that got him into serious trouble with both his superiors and allies.These last aspects are especially important.  The movie almost has the aura of a convincing documentary, because it paints Patton with his virtues and vices. This is one of the movie's strengths: it portrays Patton as he was, with both strengths and weaknesses, without openly glorifying or condemning them.  Director Franklin J. Schaffner stated in 1970 ""We are not defending General Patton, and we are not attacking General Patton.  We are really telling the true story of one of the most fabulous and interesting characters that I have ever observed in action.""  More than anything else, it's a serious study of his complex character.  This war within the man overshadows the war outside the man.  Patton was his own worst enemy, his big mouth frequently getting him into trouble, and resulting in him being relieved from his command on more than one occasion. Great as he was, he was not without weaknesses, but his failings are shown without excusing them.  In fact, Patton's weaknesses were the reason Eisenhower opted to advance General Omar Bradley ahead of Patton, although Patton was always his first choice when a brash military leader on the field was needed for a particularly bold mission. Despite his weaknesses, Patton was truly inspirational to those who served beneath him and the importance of his contribution to the Allied success is undeniable.At times the story goes beyond the man, with a broader focus on the war effort.  First Patton and Montgomery vie for success against Rommel in Sicily, and then again in Europe.  But the war scenes are always on a large scale, with wide angle shots of explosions, tanks and masses of infantry, rather than individual experiences of horror.  In the end, it is not the world war that is center stage, but the complex character of the man Patton, and the war between his passions.  George C. Scott's performance as Patton is brilliant and one of the memorable performances in cinema.  It's not surprising that the movie went on to win seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.  It has that epic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" feel, and it serves of a lasting testament to the confusing personality of a strange yet important military leader: Patton himself. -GODLY GADFLY",4,"Picture of

440125,A1Z4VB9DA01AXP,6304935811,"Gregory Canellis ""Student of military history...","[3, 4]","First of all, the movie Patton is one of my all time favorites. To say I have viewed this film dozens of times is an understatement. The new two-disc DVD version is simply spectacular. The brilliant color and clarity compared with the VHS tape is like night and day. So what is left to say about this classic winner of eight Academy Awards?Over the years, I have discovered that this movie, as great as it is, is only an introduction to the complexity of Gen George S. Patton Jr. The producers in conjunction with George C. Scott's memorable performance convey only a sample of the many sides of Patton. The film touches on Patton's multi-faceted personality with a fair degree of artistic license. Patton was well versed in history but was he, as the German officer assigned to study him concluded, an ""anachronism?"" Patton believed in reincarnation and also that his destiny was ""to lead a lot of men in a desperate battle."" But was he an eccentric? For the novice viewer who, like myself thirty years ago, is enjoying this movie for the first time, it should provide a thirst to learn more about this flamboyant military figure. The older biographies of Martin Blumenson and Ladislas Farago, the latter providing meat for the film, are good starting points. The later work by Carlo D'Este _A Genius for War_ supersedes the rest. The producers of the DVD anticipated this hunger and included an audio essay by Charles M Province (president of the George S Patton Historical Society and author of _The Unknown Patton_). Province's monologue, though factual, sounds adlibbed and unrehersed. It is obvious a prepared script would have benefited this essay.For the Patton afficionado the producer's license with chronology and settings in the film will be evident. For example, the scene where Patton untangles a gridlocked convoy occured in the town square of the city of Avranches, not in an open field as depicted in the film. It must be remembered that General of the Army Omar N. Bradley acted as chief advisor during the filming. Those well versed in this period will recognise there was no love lost between these two men and the Bradley bias must be taken into consideration. A second DVD disc goes behind the scenes of the making of Patton along with a sound track of the film's hauntingly beautiful musical score.Regardless, there is probably no better film biography of an American military figure to grace the big screen than Patton.Every scene is a gem. Even 1960s era American tanks serving both German and American forces (the former with incorrect paint scheme to boot) can be overlooked.

More than an actor, Scott was a model. You feel Patton and forget half an hour after to Scott, because he melts with the character and disappears before us, in a mesmerizing way that you could compare without any effort to Marlon Brando.Franklin Schaffner was a talented director. Imagine the caleidoscopic twist that means going from The planet of the apes to Patton and ending with Nicholas and Alexandra.The camera' s handling , the brilliant sequences of the desert{s battle, the insights of the General are described and supported by a genial script.There's a worthy point which deserves to mention: the reflections of Patton when he's in the battlefield remembering that somehow he was there, reminding the echoes of the Greeks who fought centuries ago. It's a powerful metaphor but told with such kind of force that you remind to Alejandro Magno and Achilles with making use of the emotive memories.What has it happened then after this movie?Patton is an emblematic personality the hero' s essence encarnated in the middle of the XX Century.The epic sense reachs his goals through the great triumphs, the innovative strategies, that only you can establish another brilliant soldier who was Mc Arthur in the other side of the world.I' m sure that Moshe Dayan understood the essence of this General since his student days.

Frank Slade in Scent of a Woman and Willie Stark in All the King's Men, is the kind of role to leave aspiring over-actors chomping at the bit.  And George C. Scott chews up every scene in which he appears.  But such is as it should be.  Patton was an outsized figure in American history.Patton follows the career of American general and tank commander Patton from taking a command during the North African campaign of WWII through the conclusion of the war in Europe.  This gives the movie an appropriate dramatic arc as it follows the Patton's career from an untested general to being sidelined for intemperate remarks (the Germans, unable to comprehend a free press and civilian control of the military, are suitably confused) to his triumphant return to the war on the mainland to a bittersweet d&eacute;nouement.  In between, Patton's brutally honest and unfiltered mouth and intermittent tank battles keep the level of entertainment high.Patton is completely Patton-centric (the first hint was the title).  When Patton is off-screen, characters have little to talk about but Patton.  A German intelligence officer serves as a sort of Greek chorus, telling the audience what to think in impotent attempts to inform his superiors.  I could have figured it out for myself.  The input of other commentators, historical figures such as American general Bradley and English general Montgomery, is better taken, as the viewer is forced to filter it through the speaker's own biases.Patton is certainly sympathetic to the general, but it also presents him as a tragic figure.  He can never live up to his own expectations.  He is openly rueful he is not living in a different time (as if the era of WWII wasn't warlike enough for anyone).  His mouth continues to get him in trouble despite his best efforts, a particularly harsh way to fail for someone with his personality.  And in the end he is left a warrior without a war to fight.Little, outside of Patton speaking fluent French, is seen of Patton's intellectual side.The DVD extras include theatrical trailers for Patton, Tora! Tora! Tora!, and The Longest Day; cast credits; and, in lieu of a traditional audio commentary, an audio essay on the historical (I suppose to say ""real"" would have made them feel silly) Patton overlaid on the movie.

I won't discuss its merits as movie.I saw Patton as a child in a theatrical release. But since, I've seen it also on VHS tape, 2 DVD versions and finally BD, as different releases were made.This movie is stellar in BD. It is closer to what I recall as a child in terms of detail available on a large CinemaScope style screen.  The sound does not have 5.1 imaging, but its clear and crisp, with dynamic range to make the explosions boom into your living room, while still hearing the dialog among the characters.  You'll hear more instruments in the musical soundtrack that are muffled by the lower resolution DVD and VHS sound tracks.The quality of the transfer is so good, it compares favorably against the just released Star Trek 2009. Patton looks like it was filmed just yesterday.Having seen several versions it was amazing to see details I've never seen before.In the opening address of the troops against the American flag, you can see Patton sweat big beads under his neck as his speech progresses.  The weave pattern on unit insignias are detailed on uniforms, the amputated limbs among dead soldiers in the opening post battle scene after Kasserine are more ghastly, appreciate the texture of desert sand and its transitions to land as it becomes mixed with gravel, appreciate different types of plants and cacti on the grounds, see a supposed ""dead"" body flinch as scorpions crawl on his skin, or read the details on prop newspapers read by Montgomery about Patton in Palermo.In the scene were Patton meets his his new aide after Jensen is killed, you can make out the building's all wood interiors, including lacquer on doors, 1940 era electric light switches with external wiring snaking on the walls, see the notes on the sheet music during the wine-dine session as Patton plans the attack on Sicily, appreciate different clothing materials on all the characters such as woven cotton belts, leather in holsters, cotton ammo cases and bandoleers, to the rust on the toilet seat bowls in the lavatory as Monty plans his Sicily attack.Its more anachronistic to see 1960s era tanks substitute for 1940 era models, if you know the WWII period technology well.

440146,A3KY68OTSNHM3G,6304935811,Jeffrey T. Munson,"[3, 3]","Starring George C. Scott (Gen. George S. Patton) and Karl Malden (Gen. Omar Bradley), this impeccable war movie describes the impact that General George Patton had on the U.S. Army after 1943.  Following the disaster at Kasserine Pass, in which American armor and strategly was thoroughly outclassed by the Germans, the Americans realized that a new commander was needed to command their armored units.  Patton was chosen, and his impact was felt immediately by the Germans, and he didn't let up until he was relieved by General Eisenhower.From 1943 until the surrender of Germany in May, 1945, Patton and his vaunted 3rd Army group harassed the Germans from Sicily to France.  He is responsible for driving his group one hundred miles in two days to rescue the trapped 101st airborne troops who were surrounded at Bastogne, and he led his troops on a brilliant drive through France and into Germany itself.This film does an excellent job of portraying the flamboyant Patton.  His numerous run-ins with his rival British General Montgomery are well-portrayed, and his battles with the press and his American superiors are explained in great detail, as well.  Perhaps the defining scene of the movie is when Patton is visiting a field hospital and he encounters an American private who is suffering from battle fatigue.  Patton slaps the soldier across the face and has him removed from the hospital and sent directly back to the front.  Word of this action eventually got back to Eisenhower, and Patton was made to apologize to the soldier and his entire Army.  This event followed Patton for the rest of his career.George C. Scott and Karl Malden give excellent performances in their roles as Patton and Bradley.  Scott's portrayal won him an academy award for best actor, while Malden's portrayal of Bradley, the ""soldier's soldier"", is the perfect antithesis to Scott's fiery portrayal as Patton.  The evolution of the friendship and mutual respect that developed between Patton and Bradley is handled extremely well, also.This is one of the greatest war movies I've seen.  Scott's acting is impeccable, and the historical accuracy, right down to Patton's ivory-handled pistols and his intense hatred for not only the Germans, but the Russians as well, is told with a remarkable flair that will keep the viewer glued to their screen.  I give this movie my highest recommendation.

After the war, General Patton was tasked with control of the larger portion of American occupied Germany, and his job was to dole out justice to the newly defeated enemy.For all his prejudices, Patton represented to a high degree the honor of the army and the basic generosity of the American people.He made this very plain in a reply to a question put to him by the army's Theater Judge Advocate: ""In all these talks (to the troops) I emphasized the necessity for the proper treatment of prisoners of war, both as to their lives and property. My usual statement was: ""Kill all the Germans you can but do not put them up against a wall and kill them. Do your killing while the are still fighting. After a man has surrendered, he should be treated exactly in accordance with the Rules of Land Warfare, and just as you would hope to be treated if you were foolish enough to surrender.

He could be extremely loyal, mourn the wounds of his men and at the same time shamelessly spend the lives of those men in pursuit of his own glory. He had a myriad of faults and quirks but he also had some really fine, almost anachronistic qualities. In short, he was a very complex individual. This film depiction does a magnificent job of bringing all of that out.George C. Scott earned his oscar in this role. He captured the complexity of the man who was George Patton and does so with style and vigor. The warts are there but so is the genius, the charismatic leadership and the thirst for glory.Carl Malden does no less a job in his portrayal of Omar Bradley, a vastly different type of character than Patton. The two film personalities complement each other as well as the historical ones ever did.This movie was rightly hailed as a masterpiece. It did not just portray Patton's real achievments.

Much has been written elsewhere about George C. Scott's riveting performance as U. S. Army General George S. Patton, but I shall note too that Scott's Academy Award-winning performance is one of the most memorable I've come across in biographical films. Scott successfully portrays all of Patton's contradictions, from a brash, often insubordinate, military commander to an insecure, often shy, person in private. But Scott's definitive portrayal of Patton is due too in large measure to the superb script written by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and the excellent directing by Franklin Schaffner, whose other great films include ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Papillion"". Karl Malden's no-nonsense portrayal of U. S. Army General Omar Bradley is a perfect dramatic foil to Scott's complex portrayal of Patton. And not to be missed either is the memorable Academy Award-nominated film score composed by Jerry Goldsmith, featuring his familiar signature theme for General Patton.Admittedly the movie doesn't closely adhere to the truth regarding some of the details behind the campaigns which Patton led his soldiers in North Africa, Italy, France and Germany, sacrificing veracity for dramatic impact and excellent cinematic storytelling. But it correctly notes his keen interest in reincarnation - he believed that he was once a great Roman general - and his insistence on absolute obediance by those serving under him, while he was all too willing to criticize his superiors and colleagues like American generals Bradley and Eisenhower and British general Field Marshal Montgomery. Towards the film's end, Scott's mesmerizing portrayal of the general shows how much Patton greatly disliked his Soviet counterparts, believing correctly that Eastern Europe was about to pass from the grips of one evil empire to yet another. From Patton's brash, foul language-laced speech which opens the film to the final scenes, ""Patton"" will command your attention, if not admiration, for the greatest American general of the 20th Century.",5,One of the Greatest Cinematic Biographies of a Genuine Military Genius,1148428800,"05 24, 2006",2006,2149,"['question', 'Patton', 'should', 'be', 'regarded', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'depicting', 'World', 'War', 'II', ""n't"", 'already', 'Much', 'been', 'written', 'elsewhere', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'riveting', 'performance', 'U.', 'S.', 'Army', 'General', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'shall', 'note', 'too', 'Scott', 'Academy', 'Award-winning', 'performance', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', ""'ve"", 'come', 'biographical', 'films', 'Scott', 'successfully', 'Patton', 'contradictions', 'brash', 'often', 'insubordinate', 'military', 'commander', 'insecure', 'often', 'shy', 'person', 'private', 'Scott', 'definitive', 'portrayal', 'Patton', 'due', 'too', 'large', 'measure', 'superb', 'script', 'written', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Edmund', 'H.', 'North', 'excellent', 'directing', 'Franklin', 'Schaffner', 'other', 'great', 'films', 'include', 'Planet', 'Apes', 'Papillion', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'no-nonsense', 'portrayal', 'U.', 'S.', 'Army', 'General', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'perfect', 'dramatic', 'foil', 'Scott', 'complex', 'portrayal', 'Patton', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'memorable', 'Academy', 'Award-nominated', 'film', 'score', 'composed', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'featuring', 'familiar', 'signature', 'theme', 'General', 'Patton.Admittedly', 'movie', ""n't"", 'closely', 'adhere', 'truth', 'regarding', 'details', 'campaigns', 'Patton', 'led', 'soldiers', 'North', 'Africa', 'Italy', 'France', 'Germany', 'sacrificing', 'veracity', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'excellent', 'cinematic', 'storytelling', 'correctly', 'keen', 'interest', 'reincarnation', 'believed', 'was', 'once', 'great', 'Roman', 'general', 'insistence', 'absolute', 'obediance', 'serving', 'was', 'too', 'willing', 'criticize', 'superiors', 'colleagues', 'American', 'generals', 'Bradley', 'Eisenhower', 'British', 'general', 'Field', 'Marshal', 'Montgomery', 'film', 'end', 'Scott', 'mesmerizing', 'portrayal', 'general', 'how', 'much', 'Patton', 'greatly', 'disliked', 'Soviet', 'counterparts', 'believing', 'correctly', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'was', 'pass', 'grips', 'one', 'evil', 'empire', 'yet', 'Patton', 'brash', 'foul', 'language-laced', 'speech', 'film', 'final', 'scenes', 'Patton', 'will', 'command', 'attention', 'not', 'admiration', 'greatest', 'American', 'general', '20th', 'Century']",N/A

Handley ""book lover""","[0, 0]","It leaves a lump in the throat even to comment on the brilliance of this movie which will stand the test of time and be still considered 100 years from now as possibly the greatest war movie ever put on film. A big statement maybe but when one considers the brilliance of the casting in this epic everything else becomes self evident.It brought together as possibly none before or since, a great script and an even greater actor who gave the performance of his career and in the process virtually guaranteed the immortality of this film and what it stands for. It told the story of perhaps Americas greatest General who did exactly what he was expected of him namely to fight and die for his country. Patton accomplished this in spades although he never died on the battlefield he well could have numerous times such was his ability to lead from the front and never expect any soldier to do what he would not.I doubt there is another General in Americas history about whom this could be said which is testimony enough to Pattons undoubted legacy. That his country never saw fit to include its greatest General among the 5 Star immortals  was probably due to the fact that he embarrassed both Ike and Roosevelt on several occasions with poor judgement on matters of diplomacy only and certainly not connected to anything he did on the battlefield.That these men could not see beyond their own egos and recognise Patton for what he was and reward him accordingly speaks more for their own deficiencies as it does for Pattons and deprives Americans of according Patton the highest honour which he so rightly deserved. George C Scott played Patton down to his bootstraps and gave as good a performance in portraying patton as Patton himself gave on the battlefield. Quite an achievment by any yardstick.One could even forgive Scott for not accepting the Oscar such was the brilliance of his portrayal. This performance by Scott ranks high among the handful of similar type performances in movie history. One thinks of Hackmans Popeye Doyle, Douglas's Spartacus to name two. Even in this illustrious company Scotts performance must rate at the top such was the sheer believabilty of his effort. Karl Maldens portrayal of Bradley is par excellance and not far below that of Scott. But then when did Malden ever give us a below par performance. Its not in the nature of the man. Had Malden played alongside an actor of lesser talent I believe he would have stolen the credits and rightly so, how often, sadly have we seen similar pairings but that is life and Malden is considered no less of an actor as a result.

Scott's riveting portrayal of the notorious American tank commander.  As a film biography &quot;Patton&quot; forgoes the rise of the celebrated general and merely hints at his ironic death because of injuries suffered in a traffic accident, focuses entirely on his military career commanding troops in North Africa, Sicily and France during World War II.  The strength of the script by Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, as well as of Scott's performance, is that the paradoxes of Patton are completely embraced.  Not even Patton's loyal cadre of staff officers can keep him from shooting off his mouth every time there are reporters around, but then neither German Field Marshall Rommel or English Field Marshall Montgomery can beat him on the battlefield.  Karl Malden's performance as General Omar Bradley is just as solid as Scott's, presenting a man whose personality is the complete antithesis of Patton.  Viewers find themselves identifying with the German captain who is the intelligence expert on Patton and arguably the only person in the film who really understands or respects the American general.  But the more I watch &quot;Patton,&quot; the more I am very impressed with the battle sequences of director Franklin J. Schaffner (&quot;Planet of the Apes,&quot; &quot;Pappillon&quot;), which were staged live and full-scale without special effects of miniatures.  Schaffner provides not just the large spectacle of a desert tank battle, but smaller and equally memorable moments, such as a soldier falling dead in the snow.  &quot;Patton&quot; deserved its Oscars.In terms of extra features on this DVD, the second disc features the 1997 50-minute retrospective documentary, &quot;The Making of Patton: A Tribute to Franklin J. Schaffner.&quot;  Recent interviews with the cinematographer, composer, etc., are blended with audio interviews of Schaffner and Scott from 1970, newsreel footage of Patton, along with clips and publicity stills from the film make a fitting tribute to the late director.  The audio commentary on the first disc is really more of a lecture on Patton by Charles M. Province, the author of the book &quot;The Unknown Patton&quot; and founder/president of the General George S. Patton, Jr. Historical Society.  Province more than adequately fills in what the movie leaves out about Patton's life.  On the second disc Jerry Goldsmith's Oscar nominated musical score is presented in stereo, including alternate takes and a series of radio spots.  You certainly have to appreciate what Fox has put together here: This is a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD priced as a regular DVD, a real treat for those of us who remember being mesmerized by George C.

It is the story of the famous General George Patton, one of the most successful and feared generals in WW2.  He believed in the glory of war and often quoted the classics, believing that he was reincarnated from some of history's most famous military leaders.  He cursed a lot and was, at the same time, deeply religious and there is no doubt that he cared about the men under his command. Relentless in battle, he believed in discipline and hated cowardice.  The press made a big thing about how he slapped a soldier who was crying, forcing Patton to make a public apology for that incident.This was George C. Scott's greatest role and it is interesting to note that he refused his Academy Award for best actor because he did not feel himself to be in competition with other actors.  He was larger than life in every single scene of the 171 minute epic and came across as intended - stubborn and unlikable and a bit of a nut job.  I never could either admire or feel any empathy for him as a person although I was glad that he won the battles. However, in spite of the battle scenes as well as his frequent confrontations with authorities, I found myself bored.  Maybe this was because I knew that he would win the battles and therefore found little dramatic tension.  The video was much too long and I actually fell asleep several times.  I wanted to like the film better, but unfortunately couldn't.I can't help thinking about the times in which this film hit the theaters. The Vietnam War was raging and there was a huge anti-war backlash.  Patton had to be considered the epitome of what was then called a &quot;hawk&quot; who raged about the glory of war in spite of the agony of the men who had fallen in battle.  This film was not just about WW2; it was about all war.  And it dared to glorify war itself without sugar coating it as fighting for what is right and mom's apple pie.  The appeal of the film was that it made people look at their own perceptions of war, a debate that was already on everyone's agenda.  Perhaps that it what made it so popular at the time.  It must have also played better on a big screen than my tiny TV. The film is important only for fans of war films, as it is a classic in that genre.  For all others, I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.",4,He believed in the glory of war,1000598400,"09 16, 2001",2001,2394,"['1970', 'film', 'directed', 'Franklin', 'J.', 'Schaffner', 'starring', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'won', 'eight', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'story', 'famous', 'General', 'George', 'Patton', 'one', 'most', 'successful', 'feared', 'generals', 'WW2', 'believed', 'glory', 'war', 'often', 'quoted', 'classics', 'believing', 'was', 'reincarnated', 'history', 'most', 'famous', 'military', 'leaders', 'cursed', 'lot', 'was', 'same', 'time', 'deeply', 'religious', 'doubt', 'cared', 'men', 'command', 'Relentless', 'battle', 'believed', 'discipline', 'hated', 'cowardice', 'press', 'made', 'big', 'thing', 'how', 'slapped', 'soldier', 'who', 'was', 'crying', 'forcing', 'Patton', 'make', 'public', 'apology', 'incident.This', 'was', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'greatest', 'role', 'interesting', 'note', 'refused', 'Academy', 'Award', 'best', 'actor', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'be', 'competition', 'other', 'actors', 'was', 'larger', 'life', 'single', 'scene', '171', 'minute', 'epic', 'came', 'intended', 'stubborn', 'unlikable', 'bit', 'nut', 'job', 'never', 'could', 'either', 'admire', 'feel', 'empathy', 'person', 'was', 'glad', 'won', 'battles', 'However', 'spite', 'battle', 'as', 'well', 'frequent', 'confrontations', 'authorities', 'found', 'bored', 'Maybe', 'was', 'knew', 'would', 'win', 'battles', 'therefore', 'found', 'little', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'video', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'long', 'actually', 'fell', 'asleep', 'several', 'times', 'wanted', 'film', 'better', 'unfortunately', ""couldn't.I"", 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'thinking', 'times', 'film', 'hit', 'theaters', 'Vietnam', 'War', 'was', 'raging', 'was', 'huge', 'anti-war', 'backlash', 'Patton', 'had', 'be', 'considered', 'epitome', 'what', 'was', 'then', 'called', 'quot', 'quot', 'who', 'raged', 'glory', 'war', 'spite', 'agony', 'men', 'who', 'had', 'fallen', 'battle', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'just', 'WW2', 'was', 'war', 'dared', 'glorify', 'war', 'sugar', 'coating', 'fighting', 'what', 'right', 'mom', 'apple', 'pie', 'appeal', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'people', 'look', 'own', 'perceptions', 'war', 'debate', 'was', 'already', 'everyone', 'agenda', 'Perhaps', 'what', 'made', 'so', 'popular', 'time', 'must', 'have', 'also', 'played', 'better', 'big', 'screen', 'tiny', 'TV', 'film', 'important', 'only', 'fans', 'war', 'films', 'classic', 'genre', 'others', 'can', 'only', 'give', 'lukewarm', 'recommendation']",N/A

That's why only a movie as good as this one could portray his greatness.Patton is a three hour epic about the eccentric military genius, played by the great George C. Scott.  This is a typical &quot;man movie,&quot; filled with exciting action shots and plenty of bravado.  George C. Scott's Patton is charismatic, a bit crazy, and incredibly inspiring.  The film is very informative, and it solifdifies General Patton's reputuation as the only military commander feared and respected by the Nazis.i didn't know much about Patton before watching this, but I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of him now.  The producers of the film set out to make this a biopic about General Patton and his colorful personality.  What resulted from their efforts, however, was a movie that glorified war more than any movie could.  Don't expect it to be like Saving Private Ryan, it's more of a romanticized look at one individual and a bygone era.The DVD contains plenty of special features, including previews of other Fox war movies and a &quot;making of&quot; video.

That packaging used the 2008 digital remastering of the film, a remastering that seemed OK...until compared to this 2012 BD version, which I went ahead and purchased after reading glowing reviews of this latest remastering at amazon and elsewhere.As others have noted, this 2012 version is far superior to the 2008 version. There's just so much more detail, contrast and depth to this version that it's hard to believe I could have felt satisfied with the 2008 issue. Visually, this is a stunner, and well worth the $10-20 price point it is often sold at by amazon. The packaging also includes the DVD version.The soundtrack, however, leaves much to be desired. There's lots of distortion in the sound, and not just in the battle scenes where explosions and the noises of tanks and trucks seem boosted above the normal playback level. The distortion also afflicts the dialogue in many places. Sadly, this is another case of a studio spending money to greatly improve picture quality while doing nothing to improve the sound. One would think that in this age of digital editing and restoration that an effort would be made to get the soundtrack into a condition that matches the visual element. I guess not.I have one more complaint, and that's with the subtitles that appear whenever the Germans are speaking: they're positioned over the film image and are very difficult to read at times as they're set in white at a very small point size, often against a very light background. I assume the subtitles are in the film negative and have always appeared this way. But with modern digital technology, those subtitles could be removed from the picture and placed below the screen in the black area that sits at the bottom of any HDTV when playing back a widescreen movie. Again, there would be some expense involved, but as there are relatively few subtitles in the movie, it couldn't be that big of an expense.The visual element of this film deserves a 5-star rating, but the problems noted above knock this version's overall rating down to 4 stars.",4,2012 Blu-Ray Is A Big Improvement Visually,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,2117,"['already', 'own', '40th-Anniversary', 'Blu-Ray', 'Book', 'version', 'film', 'packaging', 'used', '2008', 'digital', 'remastering', 'film', 'remastering', 'seemed', 'OK', 'compared', '2012', 'BD', 'version', 'went', 'ahead', 'purchased', 'reading', 'glowing', 'reviews', 'latest', 'remastering', 'amazon', 'elsewhere.As', 'others', 'have', 'noted', '2012', 'version', 'far', 'superior', '2008', 'version', 'just', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'detail', 'contrast', 'depth', 'version', 'hard', 'believe', 'could', 'have', 'felt', 'satisfied', '2008', 'issue', 'Visually', 'stunner', 'well', '10-20', 'price', 'point', 'often', 'sold', 'amazon', 'packaging', 'also', 'DVD', 'version.The', 'soundtrack', 'however', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'lots', 'distortion', 'sound', 'not', 'just', 'battle', 'where', 'explosions', 'noises', 'tanks', 'trucks', 'seem', 'boosted', 'normal', 'playback', 'level', 'distortion', 'also', 'dialogue', 'many', 'places', 'Sadly', 'case', 'studio', 'spending', 'money', 'greatly', 'improve', 'picture', 'quality', 'doing', 'nothing', 'improve', 'sound', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'age', 'digital', 'editing', 'restoration', 'effort', 'would', 'be', 'made', 'get', 'soundtrack', 'condition', 'visual', 'element', 'guess', 'not.I', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'complaint', 'subtitles', 'appear', 'Germans', 'are', 'speaking', ""'re"", 'positioned', 'film', 'image', 'are', 'very', 'difficult', 'read', 'times', ""'re"", 'set', 'white', 'very', 'small', 'point', 'size', 'often', 'very', 'light', 'background', 'assume', 'subtitles', 'are', 'film', 'negative', 'have', 'always', 'appeared', 'way', 'modern', 'digital', 'technology', 'subtitles', 'could', 'be', 'removed', 'picture', 'placed', 'screen', 'black', 'area', 'bottom', 'HDTV', 'when', 'playing', 'back', 'widescreen', 'movie', 'Again', 'would', 'be', 'expense', 'involved', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'subtitles', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'big', 'expense.The', 'visual', 'element', 'film', '5-star', 'rating', 'problems', 'noted', 'knock', 'version', 'overall', 'rating', 'down', '4', 'stars']",N/A

Though obviously a fairly big-budget film, it's equally obvious that no budget would have been able to do full justice to the scope of the events the movie depicts. You can't have tens of thousands of extras, and thousands of vintage WWII aircraft and vehicles. But the makers of this movie did an excellent job in using the resources they did have to suggest far bigger numbers. You repeatedly see Patton in his jeep or car, leading columns of trucks or tanks, with foot soldiers slogging along beside. And it gives an adequate illusion of much greater numbers.One way in which they fell a bit short in this area, though, was in the use of aircraft. If you watch this movie, you might get the idea that the entire Luftwaffe consisted of just two twin-engine planes, which followed Patton from North Africa to Sicily to the European continent. I kept thinking ""Can't anybody shoot down those two blasted planes before they do more damage?

It just may be George C. Scott's performance which enamoured you.The account of Patton's record during World War 11 is taken from memoirs of himself, Gen. Omar Bradley and German records. This is the one general the Germans stood in awe of: the one general they feared. When the Germans were burning records and making a retreat during the end of the war, one of them, burning his picture, called Patton the pure warrior, whom the absence of war would kill. Within the next year, Patton was dead, dying from an accident after having come through the war unscathed.Patton was a lot of things. One thing he was not was political. He didn't know how to keep his mouth shut. He said and did disturbing things, getting in hot water continually with Ike (Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower). He couldn't get away with anything, since he made such good copy, the reporters were always after him.He slapped a soldier and declared him a coward who was shell-shocked (or whatever the modern term is) and whose nerves were totally gone. For that, Ike made him apologize to the soldier, units of soldiers, and the hospital staff. But did he do it on their level? He did not. He stood on a balcony above them, looking down on them. Had he been on the same level, it might have been more effective.He stormed across Europe to Berlin, marching his soldiers 24 hours to relieve the Battle of the Bulge soldiers, then on to Berlin. But still, he couldn't stay his mouth or stay out of trouble. In an interview with reporters, he was asked about leaving Nazis in key positions. He said that they knew how to keep the water works and electricity working. In response to one question, he said that Nazis had joined the party in the same way that American Republicans or Democrats had done. It was in response to a trick question, and he fell for it.He also wanted to kick the Russians in the behind and send them back where they belonged. He told Ike he had the troops and begged to be able to do it. Given the cold war that developed for years and years, Patton was right.But he was politically incorrect. He suffered for it. The Americans got rid of him. In a well-balanced scene, it showed Field Marshall Montgomery of Britain being received by the King of England to be honoured with the country's highest award. The scene switches to that of Patton leaving his post and shaking the hands of every one of his staff.It is heart-rending, but let's keep in mind that Patton's boss (Ike) was looking, even then, towards the presidency. He couldn't afford to have such a politically incorrect general who made such good copy for reporters. So Ike got rid of him.However, it is also possible that, as the Germans predicted, this greatest of warriors had outlived his time and that the absence of war killed him.Patton was a deeply religious man. My favourite scene is when he was on his way to relieve the Battle of the Bulge warriors. It had snowed deeply for days and air cover was needed. Patton sends for the chaplain. He tells him he wants &#34;a weather prayer.&#34; He assures the chaplain that he, Patton, is on such good terms with the Almighty, that if the prayer is offered, the next day will be clear for air cover. Then he says: &#34;I expect that prayer within the hour.&#34;The next day was clear. And that was Patton.",5,"""The absence of war will kill him"": the German view",1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3423,"['magnificent', 'movie', 'one', 'favourites', 'difficult', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'General', 'Patton', 'be', 'careful', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'performance', 'enamoured', 'you.The', 'account', 'Patton', 'record', 'World', 'War', '11', 'taken', 'memoirs', 'Gen.', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'German', 'records', 'one', 'general', 'Germans', 'stood', 'awe', 'one', 'general', 'feared', 'When', 'Germans', 'were', 'burning', 'records', 'making', 'retreat', 'end', 'war', 'one', 'burning', 'picture', 'called', 'Patton', 'pure', 'warrior', 'whom', 'absence', 'war', 'would', 'kill', 'next', 'year', 'Patton', 'was', 'dead', 'dying', 'accident', 'having', 'come', 'war', 'unscathed.Patton', 'was', 'lot', 'things', 'One', 'thing', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'political', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'keep', 'mouth', 'shut', 'said', 'did', 'disturbing', 'things', 'getting', 'hot', 'water', 'continually', 'Ike', 'Gen.', 'Dwight', 'D.', 'Eisenhower', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'anything', 'made', 'such', 'good', 'copy', 'reporters', 'were', 'always', 'him.He', 'slapped', 'soldier', 'declared', 'coward', 'who', 'was', 'shell-shocked', 'whatever', 'modern', 'term', 'nerves', 'were', 'totally', 'gone', 'Ike', 'made', 'apologize', 'soldier', 'units', 'soldiers', 'hospital', 'staff', 'did', 'do', 'level', 'did', 'not', 'stood', 'balcony', 'looking', 'down', 'Had', 'been', 'same', 'level', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'effective.He', 'stormed', 'Europe', 'Berlin', 'marching', 'soldiers', '24', 'hours', 'relieve', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'soldiers', 'then', 'Berlin', 'still', 'could', ""n't"", 'stay', 'mouth', 'stay', 'trouble', 'interview', 'reporters', 'was', 'asked', 'leaving', 'Nazis', 'key', 'positions', 'said', 'knew', 'how', 'keep', 'water', 'works', 'electricity', 'working', 'response', 'one', 'question', 'said', 'Nazis', 'had', 'joined', 'party', 'same', 'way', 'American', 'Republicans', 'Democrats', 'had', 'done', 'was', 'response', 'trick', 'question', 'fell', 'it.He', 'also', 'wanted', 'kick', 'Russians', 'behind', 'send', 'back', 'where', 'belonged', 'told', 'Ike', 'had', 'troops', 'begged', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'Given', 'cold', 'war', 'developed', 'years', 'years', 'Patton', 'was', 'right.But', 'was', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'suffered', 'Americans', 'got', 'rid', 'well-balanced', 'scene', 'showed', 'Field', 'Marshall', 'Montgomery', 'Britain', 'being', 'received', 'King', 'England', 'be', 'honoured', 'country', 'highest', 'award', 'scene', 'Patton', 'leaving', 'post', 'shaking', 'hands', 'one', 'staff.It', 'heart-rending', 'let', 'keep', 'mind', 'Patton', 'boss', 'Ike', 'was', 'looking', 'even', 'then', 'presidency', 'could', ""n't"", 'afford', 'have', 'such', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'general', 'who', 'made', 'such', 'good', 'copy', 'reporters', 'So', 'Ike', 'got', 'rid', 'him.However', 'also', 'possible', 'that', 'Germans', 'predicted', 'greatest', 'warriors', 'had', 'outlived', 'time', 'absence', 'war', 'killed', 'him.Patton', 'was', 'deeply', 'religious', 'man', 'favourite', 'scene', 'when', 'was', 'way', 'relieve', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'warriors', 'had', 'snowed', 'deeply', 'days', 'air', 'cover', 'was', 'needed', 'Patton', 'chaplain', '34', 'weather', 'prayer.', '34', 'chaplain', 'Patton', 'such', 'good', 'terms', 'Almighty', 'prayer', 'offered', 'next', 'day', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'air', 'cover', 'Then', '34', 'expect', 'prayer', 'hour.', '34', 'next', 'day', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'Patton']",N/A
440200,AU0NV5KSJ02QZ,6304935811,M. Bonet,"[91, 111]","I have always loved the movie ""Patton"".  It is a true classic and a treasure in cinema.  I give 3 stars to this special edition because of the following reasons. I cannot understand why 20th Century Fox chose to add the Documentary ""Ghost Corp"" which seems to want to imply that Patton abandoned the XX Corp and particularly the 94th Infantry deliberately with no reason.  Horrible incidences happen in war, this one happened because Patton was on his way north to fight a little annoyance called THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE!, also he was going to rescue the 101st Airborne surrounded by German Forces at Bastogne from being ANNIHILATED!. In the documentary ""The making of Patton"" there is a clip from Oliver Stone stating that the movie ""Patton"" was responsible for Nixon invading and bombing Cambodia, which, according to Oliver Stone, forced the Khmer Rouge to kill millions of Cambodians.  He states that only two movies he knows of ever influenced history; ""Patton"" and of course his movie ""JFK"".  Naturally his (Oliver Stone)'s movie was in a good way.  ""Patton"" just caused destruction and death.  My view of this is that 20th Century Fox wanted to be politically correct and shield itself from anyone anywhere at anytime thinking that they would glorify war.  I have never ever heard of a single person thinking seriously that the movie ""Patton"" glorified war. Whoever thought that at Fox is an idiot and obviously does not think much of the audiences' intelligence that watched ""Patton"".  Oliver Stone is simply pitiful. He wishes that he could make a movie that would live in people's hearts like ""Patton"" does.  He will never touch that greatness, his films will never obtain that level of affection in people's hearts. People don't love ""Patton"" because it is a war picture.  We love it because it is great, it resonates in our hearts and it gave us an image of a complex man and the great men around him who sacrificed, bled, and accomplished heroic deeds.  It is positive and gives us hope, unlike the depressing, hopeless, and disposable garbage that Oliver Stone puts out.",3,Why the Sabotage?,1167955200,"01 5, 2007",2007,2084,"['have', 'always', 'loved', 'movie', 'Patton', 'true', 'classic', 'treasure', 'cinema', 'give', '3', 'stars', 'special', 'edition', 'following', 'reasons', 'can', 'not', 'understand', 'why', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'chose', 'add', 'Documentary', 'Ghost', 'Corp', 'want', 'imply', 'Patton', 'abandoned', 'XX', 'Corp', 'particularly', '94th', 'Infantry', 'deliberately', 'reason', 'Horrible', 'incidences', 'happen', 'war', 'one', 'happened', 'Patton', 'was', 'way', 'north', 'fight', 'little', 'annoyance', 'called', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'THE', 'BULGE', 'also', 'was', 'going', 'rescue', '101st', 'Airborne', 'surrounded', 'German', 'Forces', 'Bastogne', 'being', 'ANNIHILATED', 'documentary', 'making', 'Patton', 'clip', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'stating', 'movie', 'Patton', 'was', 'responsible', 'Nixon', 'invading', 'bombing', 'Cambodia', 'according', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'forced', 'Khmer', 'Rouge', 'kill', 'millions', 'Cambodians', 'only', 'two', 'movies', 'ever', 'influenced', 'history', 'Patton', 'course', 'movie', 'JFK', 'Naturally', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'way', 'Patton', 'just', 'caused', 'destruction', 'death', 'view', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'wanted', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'shield', 'anyone', 'anywhere', 'anytime', 'thinking', 'would', 'glorify', 'war', 'have', 'never', 'ever', 'heard', 'single', 'person', 'thinking', 'seriously', 'movie', 'Patton', 'glorified', 'war', 'thought', 'Fox', 'idiot', 'obviously', 'not', 'think', 'much', 'audiences', 'intelligence', 'watched', 'Patton', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'simply', 'pitiful', 'could', 'make', 'movie', 'would', 'live', 'people', 'hearts', 'Patton', 'will', 'never', 'touch', 'greatness', 'films', 'will', 'never', 'obtain', 'level', 'affection', 'people', 'hearts', 'People', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'Patton', 'war', 'picture', 'love', 'great', 'hearts', 'gave', 'image', 'complex', 'man', 'great', 'men', 'who', 'sacrificed', 'bled', 'accomplished', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'positive', 'hope', 'depressing', 'hopeless', 'disposable', 'garbage', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'out']",N/A

440205,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,6304935811,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[2, 3]","General George S. Patton Jr. (1885-1945) was one of America's most outstanding generals and strategists during World War II, but his tendency to speak very candidly and crassly often got him into trouble with the public and higher ranking officers.  Labeled by newspapers as ""Blood & Guts"", Patton demanded discipline from every soldier under his command.  He loved to study about ancient battles and saw himself as one of many reincarnations of various warriors who had fought battles throughout 2000 years.  He loved war and knew nothing else.  Beginning in 1942, General Patton commanded forces in North Africa fighting against the occupying German forces under the command of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel.  Following victory in North Africa, he commanded the Seventh Army during the joint invasion of Sicily.  British forces that also invaded Sicily were under the command of the revered Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery.  Following the allied invasion of France in 1944, General Patton was given command of the Third Army and swept across France at record pace.  His juggernaut was also successful in relieving the beleaguered American troops trapped in the city of Bastogne, France.  He was also one of the first American commanders to discover the horrors of Nazi concentration camps.  Considered by many to be a prima donna, he had no tolerance for any soldier suffering from ""shell shock"" or ""battle fatigue""; instead he labeled such as a coward.  He wrote a book entitled ""War As I Knew It"" that was first published in 1947, two years after his death from a car accident.Based upon the two books ""Patton: Ordeal and Triumph"" by Ladislas Farago and ""A Soldier's Story"" by General Oman N. Bradley, director Franklin J. Schaffner created the film ""Patton"" in 1970 starring George C. Scott as the outspoken General Patton, which earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  (Scott refused to accept the Oscar on the grounds that he did not consider himself to be in competition with other actors.)  The film begins with Patton standing before a giant American flag and giving a speech to troops that have been placed under his command.  Following the speech, the film documents Patton's life between 1942 (when he begins fighting Germans in North Africa) and 1945 (shortly after the defeat of Germany).Aspects of the film that well depict General Patton were the competition that he felt with Field Marshall Montgomery (Michael Bates) and personality conflicts with General Bradley (Karl Malden). Of course, since the actual General Bradley consulted directly on the film, the portrayal of Patton could be regarded as being slightly biased.  Also depicted were Patton's slapping of a frightened soldier (Tim Considine) whom he also accused of being a coward, as well as candid comments made in Knutsford, England, that made Patton a public relations liability for the Allied Command.  Sadly, not shown in the film was the liberation of the concentration camp at Buchenwald by the Third Army.  There, General Patton was the first American commander to order nearby German civilians to tour a liberated concentrated camp: a precedent adopted by other American field commanders.Franklin J. Schaffner received the Oscar for Best Director for ""Patton"" and the film also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Sound and Best Writing.  It also received nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Music and Best Visual Effects.  At 170 minutes, the film does not seem too long.  Instead, the various battles were done very well and George C. Scott's excellent portrayal of General Patton is completely engaging.  Overall, I rank ""Patton"" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend the film to everyone.

He was also ruthless and pushed his men to the extreme but he was up there with them. One of the best generals of the last few centuries by any reconing.  This film could have been a disaster but instead it was a masterpiece. From it's starting speech to it's final moments as the great warrior waits for more battles. This movie is even more remarkable in that it came out in 1970 when the military was hated by hollywood and they did smear jobs about it. Not that it's perfect mind you or that war is really glorious in reality. But that's how patton saw it and it's a good thing he did too. This movie looks great on blu ray and the print is free of dirt, the natural film grain is there but that's ok. Patton is a war hero and this film which one an oscar for the great late george c scott. (and it made him a movie star instead of just a character actor) is worth every penny .

440209,A1RPTVW5VEOSI,6304935811,Michael J. Edelman,"[0, 0]","""Patton"" is a perfect example of how great moviemaking and great story telling don't necessarily have to be rooted in fact. This is one of the greatest American movies ever made, withe several brilliant performances from Scott and others, great writing, breathtaking cinematograph, and a score that at times sends chills down your spine. This is truly great filmmaking. Unfortunately, it's also very poor history. The writers relied heavily on Ladislas Farago's biography and Omar Bradley's autobiography, and as a consequence, Bradley comes off almost angelic in comparison to Patton, who is portrayed as a foul-mouthed, near insane fanatic, and he was none of these things.George Patton was a child of the 19th Century, born to great wealth, who put all that aside in order to devote his life to being a soldier, and he do so magnificently. He actually used a chunk of his personal fortune to buy spare parts for the new US Army Armored divisions between the wars, when there wasn't enough government funding to keep them going. Those who served under him were almost unanimous in their their admiration, and those who fought against him believed he was the greatest general the Allies had. Bradley, by comparison, was often characterized as overly cautious, relieving commanders who showed initiative, and refusing the the British offer of specialized tanks (""funnies"") in the Normandy invasion. His public image was largely the product of the writing of Ernie Pyle, who took it upon himself to lionize Bradley.  Unfortunately none of this comes across in the film.And yet... I still think this is a five star film. It's so well made, so excellent in every way, that I think the question of historical accuracy can be disregarded when judging it. See it, and enjoy it, but don't come away thinking it's a true portrayal of the characters portrayed.",5,Questionable history- but a brilliant movie,1346889600,"09 6, 2012",2012,1851,"['Patton', 'perfect', 'example', 'how', 'great', 'moviemaking', 'great', 'story', 'telling', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'be', 'rooted', 'fact', 'one', 'greatest', 'American', 'movies', 'ever', 'made', 'withe', 'several', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'Scott', 'others', 'great', 'writing', 'breathtaking', 'cinematograph', 'score', 'times', 'sends', 'chills', 'down', 'spine', 'truly', 'great', 'filmmaking', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'very', 'poor', 'history', 'writers', 'relied', 'heavily', 'Ladislas', 'Farago', 'biography', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'autobiography', 'consequence', 'Bradley', 'off', 'almost', 'angelic', 'comparison', 'Patton', 'who', 'portrayed', 'foul-mouthed', 'near', 'insane', 'fanatic', 'was', 'none', 'things.George', 'Patton', 'was', 'child', '19th', 'Century', 'born', 'great', 'wealth', 'who', 'put', 'aside', 'order', 'devote', 'life', 'being', 'soldier', 'do', 'so', 'magnificently', 'actually', 'used', 'chunk', 'personal', 'fortune', 'buy', 'spare', 'parts', 'new', 'US', 'Army', 'Armored', 'divisions', 'wars', 'when', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'government', 'funding', 'keep', 'going', 'who', 'served', 'were', 'almost', 'unanimous', 'admiration', 'who', 'fought', 'believed', 'was', 'greatest', 'general', 'Allies', 'had', 'Bradley', 'comparison', 'was', 'often', 'characterized', 'overly', 'cautious', 'relieving', 'commanders', 'who', 'showed', 'initiative', 'refusing', 'British', 'offer', 'specialized', 'tanks', 'funnies', 'Normandy', 'invasion', 'public', 'image', 'was', 'largely', 'product', 'writing', 'Ernie', 'Pyle', 'who', 'took', 'lionize', 'Bradley', 'Unfortunately', 'none', 'film.And', 'yet', 'still', 'think', 'five', 'star', 'film', 'so', 'well', 'made', 'so', 'excellent', 'way', 'think', 'question', 'historical', 'accuracy', 'can', 'be', 'disregarded', 'when', 'judging', 'See', 'enjoy', 'do', ""n't"", 'come', 'away', 'thinking', 'true', 'portrayal', 'characters', 'portrayed']",N/A

440212,A1CVM427QH52BL,6304935811,Michael T Kennedy,"[0, 0]","George Patton was the scion of a wealthy family in California. He was an athlete and sailed his own boat to Hawaii in the 1930s to assume a command. He was a member of the US Olympic team in 1912, competing in the modern pentathlon.  He served in World War I and his interest in armour began here with command of the US Tank Corps.  The movie takes up his career when he was assigned to replace General Freydendall after the battle of Kasserine Pass in which green American troops were routed by the Germans under General Rommel. The movie is pretty accurate although Patton had a high pitched voice, unlike the growling baritone George C Scott adopted in the role. Having read a biography of General Marshall, I don't believe that Patton was as much at risk of being sent home as is depicted in the movie. Marshall and Eisenhower well well aware of Patton's strength as a troop commander. He, himself, recognized that he was no politician and was marginally suited for high command in which politics are as important as military genius.The movie has established the reputation of Patton with the public, which has a probably hazy impression of Wold War II by now. It is well done and the Blue Ray version is a visual treat. Scott won an Academy Award for the role, which was well deserved. Karl Malden does well playing General Bradley and, as Bradley was technical advisor for the film, it is no surprise that he comes out of it as the wise adult to Patton's brash immaturity at times. Some of the scenes that appear exaggerated, such as the ""weather prayer"" and Patton's belief in reincarnation, are accurate and add to the man's reputation as an eccentric.

It begins with his Africa campaign and takes it through Italy and ends in Germany at the conclusion of the WWII.This film shows both Patton's brilliance as a general and his flaws of as a man.  Patton's was a man of passion and was more interested in what was most effective than what was politically correct (as in office politics not social politics).  His career is shown against his good friend Omar Bradley's career.  Bradley followed the rules and advanced quickly and surpassed the maverick Patton.George C Scott was a leading actor on stage but until Patton he was only a featured performer in movies.  This raw performance made Scott the first choice for these types of roles in the future (but he was better at comedy!)Karl Malden was already a star and Oscar winner but his performance of the by the books general lead him to a successful TV sereies.This is a well made film and for many involved was their finest hour.

440221,AB5DVSNPX1JSK,6304935811,"Mr. Fisher ""grand_clown""","[2, 2]","Patton is a film that was made in 1970.  It's a film that tells the story of one of America's most remembered and most telling characters in history.  George C. Scott gives the performance of the century playing George S. Patton, looking and sounding and acting just like the real Patton, as recorded by Gen. Omar Bradley in which the film is based on.Patton is a very different war movie.  It was quite revolutionary in its time.  Unlike a lot of war movies that survive off special effects, gore and heroism, Patton shines with its drama and realism as you follow the war-time biography of Patton.  You learn a great deal about the politics, the system of the upper brass in our armed forces, and the frustration to coordinate and perform critical opperations.  You also learn a great deal about the man, Patton, himself.There is so much character developing, so much hard work put into the character of Patton, it clearly pays off in a huge way.  This film will intrigue you as well as enlighten you.  Patton's character is entertaining, he's real, he's distant yet close when it comes to relating, and he can be serious as well as funny.  All of this makes Patton a master piece.There is one little problem I had with the film.  And that is I wasn't really pleased with Patton's heroic march through the winter of '44 to save the sieged soldiers.  It wasn't very clear and it had little to no action in it, just telling you that they won it.  This wasn't satisfactory, and yet it was Patton's highlight of his military career.  A major let down, but it wasn't major enough to ruin the film.  Thankfully.  If it wasn't for the structure of the film, which already lacked action and engagements of battles, this might've ruined it if you are somebody who is interested in detailed history of the occurrences in WWII like me.Overall Patton is a very powerful, dramatic film that circles around a man and his obsession with being a combat general in the heat of a war.  It's a film that you will probably see more than once because it is a very special film.You cannot get enough Patton, his character will live on because it comes across so powerfully in this film.  It is a character and a story you are unlikely to forget.Grade: A",5,Patton is top brass!,1061337600,"08 20, 2003",2003,2233,"['Patton', 'film', 'was', 'made', '1970', 'film', 'story', 'one', 'America', 'most', 'remembered', 'most', 'telling', 'characters', 'history', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'performance', 'century', 'playing', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'looking', 'sounding', 'acting', 'just', 'real', 'Patton', 'recorded', 'Gen.', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'film', 'based', 'on.Patton', 'very', 'different', 'war', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'revolutionary', 'time', 'lot', 'war', 'movies', 'survive', 'special', 'effects', 'gore', 'heroism', 'Patton', 'drama', 'realism', 'follow', 'war-time', 'biography', 'Patton', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'politics', 'system', 'upper', 'brass', 'armed', 'forces', 'frustration', 'coordinate', 'perform', 'critical', 'opperations', 'also', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'man', 'Patton', 'so', 'much', 'character', 'developing', 'so', 'much', 'hard', 'work', 'put', 'character', 'Patton', 'clearly', 'off', 'huge', 'way', 'film', 'will', 'intrigue', 'as', 'well', 'enlighten', 'Patton', 'character', 'entertaining', 'real', 'distant', 'yet', 'close', 'when', 'relating', 'can', 'be', 'serious', 'as', 'well', 'funny', 'Patton', 'master', 'piece.There', 'one', 'little', 'problem', 'had', 'film', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'pleased', 'Patton', 'heroic', 'march', 'winter', ""'44"", 'save', 'sieged', 'soldiers', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'clear', 'had', 'little', 'action', 'just', 'telling', 'won', 'was', ""n't"", 'satisfactory', 'yet', 'was', 'Patton', 'highlight', 'military', 'career', 'major', 'let', 'down', 'was', ""n't"", 'major', 'enough', 'ruin', 'film', 'Thankfully', 'was', ""n't"", 'structure', 'film', 'already', 'lacked', 'action', 'engagements', 'battles', 'might', ""'ve"", 'ruined', 'are', 'somebody', 'who', 'interested', 'detailed', 'history', 'occurrences', 'WWII', 'me.Overall', 'Patton', 'very', 'powerful', 'dramatic', 'film', 'man', 'obsession', 'being', 'combat', 'general', 'heat', 'war', 'film', 'will', 'probably', 'see', 'more', 'once', 'very', 'special', 'film.You', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'enough', 'Patton', 'character', 'will', 'live', 'so', 'powerfully', 'film', 'character', 'story', 'are', 'unlikely', 'forget.Grade']",N/A

His attitude was gruff, his outlook bloody, and his thirst for conflict insatiable.  But with this film, viewers get to see exactly why this opinionated, sometimes unethical General was possibly the greatest leader on the battlefield in the European Theatre of World War II - and George C. Scott portrays Patton in a most memorable manner.Without a doubt, Patton's exploits on the battlefield won great victories for the Allies.  This is, of course, not to take away from powerful leaders on both sides, such as Patton's comrade-yet-rival Field Marshal Sir Bernard Law Montgomery, but Patton will always be remembered by the United States Army not only for his glories, but also for the controversy he managed to stir up.  This film showcases both sides of the man.  His respect for the uniform and his undeniable loyalty to the United States of America made him the hero, but his quest to &quot;beat Montgomery to Messina&quot; and the incident in which he slapped an enlisted man and called him a coward do much to antagonize him in the eyes of many.  That's one of the greatest things about this film:  the filmmakers have made it so that it does not concentrate wholly on Patton's good side nor his bad side, but instead, create an atmosphere in which the viewer's opinion of the man constantly changes.Packed with intense battle scenes, dialogue that is often nearly as intense, and some somber moments, &quot;Patton&quot; is a film that will have your attention for the entirety of its nearly three-hour running length.  If you're the special-effects lover, then this film is probably not for you, but understand that it was made before the advent of computer-aided and, in my opinion, useless and corny graphic effects.

Standing before the biggest American flag I&#65533;ve ever seen, General George S. Patton Jr. wears a highly buffed, black helmet and a uniform suggesting the 18th or 19th century, weighed down with medals domestic and foreign, bearing not one but two ivory-handled revolvers, and holding a riding crop. As a bugler plays &#65533;To the Colors,"" the camera focuses on each feature in turn. And then Scott lets loose with the picture&#65533;s famous monologue (an edited version of a speech he actually gave to American troops in England on the eve of D-Day).&#65533;Now I want you to remember that no bastard ever won a war by dying for his country. He won it by making the other poor dumb bastard die for his country&#65533;.&#65533;Atten &#65533; tion!Consider the time. In 1969, when Patton was made, America was mired in an unpopular war in Vietnam, the draft was just about to be ended, and America was preparing to pull her fighting men out of the first military defeat in her history. Many who supported the war effort, felt the military had been sabotaged by the media. And here was this spirit from the past, saying that &#65533;Americans love to fight,&#65533; and &#65533;will not tolerate a loser&#65533;!Early in Patton, we hear the sound of distant trumpets, as in 1943, the general surveys the ancient battlefield where Carthage (modern name, Tunis, in Tunisia) was burnt to the ground by the Romans in 146 B.C.Patton is standing near the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, where over 1,000 American G.I.s were butchered in their first encounter with the German Wehrmacht, in the form of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel&#65533;s Afrika Korps. &#65533;I was there,&#65533; he tells his assistant. In 146 B.C.Is he mad or is he teasing? The answer is, a little of both.He quotes from a lush, romantic poem of the eternal warrior &#65533; he is the poet. An American poet-general? Clearly, we are dealing with a man singular in the annals of 20th century American warfare. &#65533;I hate the 20th century,&#65533; the old &#65533;cavalry horse officer&#65533; remarks.He refers to himself as a &#65533;prima donna,&#65533; but as director Franklin Schaffner, scenarists Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North, and star George C. Scott portray him, &#65533;megalomaniac&#65533; is more like it. Before going in to battle, as he stands before his mirror, his Negro soldier-valet carefully placing his begoggled helmet on his head, he more closely resembles a Roman general (or Il Duce) than a modern officer. And in a notorious, true incident, upon encountering a shell-shocked soldier, he slaps the man silly, threatens to shoot him, and is almost cashiered by Ike. But he was our greatest 20th century field commander.(The valet is played by a trim, youthful-looking, fifty-year-old Jimmy Edwards. Unfortunately, Edwards (Home of the Brave, Bright Victory, The Member of the Wedding, The Manchurian Candidate, etc.), whose career was limited by racism, died of a massive heart attack before the film&#65533;s release. He went through hell, paving the way so that the likes of Sidney Poitier and Denzel Washington could become screen icons, while he was forgotten.)In Patton&#65533;s brutality, in his talk of never giving up an inch of land (Hitler said the very same thing.), in his contempt for civilian authority, in his joy at killing, he comes across as a fascist or Nazi, which is how he was often depicted at the time. Amazingly, the movie is able to glorify this man, while maintaining a posture of cold sentimentality towards him. Schaffner loves Patton, but without illusions. Patton wasn&#65533;t &#65533;larger than life&#65533; &#65533; no one is - he WAS life, or at least the martial, intellectual, and aesthetic lives, in all their fullness.George Patton Jr. had a sense of destiny; his purpose in life was to achieve greatness leading &#65533;desperate men in combat.&#65533; And as he observes, only once in a thousand years, do the heavens so align themselves that a soldier has such an opportunity to change history.Fortunately, in the movie as in life, Patton had humble, ordinary Joe - at least as Bradley tells it - Gen. Omar Bradley (the last five-star, General of the Army, in the history of the U.S. Army) as a counterweight. Bradley is played by Karl Malden with a restraint and self-effacing humor that perfectly contrast Patton/Scott&#65533;s bravado.Jerry Goldsmith&#65533;s score has just the right blend of the elegiac (distant trumpets) and the pompous yet playful (fanfare of horns and flutes), corresponding to the tempers of Patton&#65533;s personality.While almost three hours long, Patton does not flag, and could easily have been longer.The DVD has a lovely documentary on the making of Patton, as well as Jerry Goldsmith&#65533;s rousing score.Just as Patton could not savor his success, so too George C. Scott, the rare actor who could carry a film on his shoulders, was unable to build on his success as Patton. But for one moment, he tasted of that perfection that comes when the stars align, and a great role is delivered into the hands of just the right actor at just the right moment in his career. It was George C. Scott&#65533;s destiny to play Patton.Originally published in The Critical Critic, September 20, 2003.",5,Patton&iquest;s Secret is the Past,1065139200,"10 3, 2003",2003,5534,"['65533', 'Das',

The film shows in great detail about the man and not just about the second world war.  patton shows us the human side of the ""only general that the axis powere truly feared""  this movie grabs your attention from the start (with that excellent speach in front of that HUGE american flag)  and it never lets go..you get drawn into it..you get to see how one of the worlds greatest generals was..granted its hollywood, but it was adapted from great works, by pattons second general and friend  omar bradly that book being ""a soldiers story"" a great read..and ""patton ordeal and triumph""  another great read  which you can get here on amazon i bet:)this film goes into how he thinks and what he truly feels..remember, he believed in reincarmation.. and  he believed in taking military action..by reading the books of his enemy to see how they thought and used that knowledge gained against them..remember..know your enemy..( he read rommel's books on the tank in attack during the africa campaign..and then later was reading the history of the norman conquest, as well as the works of ceaser, and many more..he was a 16th  century warrior trapped in contempory times..being the 1940,s)when patton talked, he gave it to his people nice and dirty..that way they would remember it..he carried  ivory pistols, wrote poetry, was deeply religious (loved the scene where he demanded a weather prayer...thats classic) and lets not forget driving general eisenhower crazy i bet  with his antics  including the soldier slapping incident,  which i have to say  was not the smartest thing to do  but i understand why he did it..that soldier was just ""shell shocked"" thats all...where other soldiers were dying and god knows worse  patton was just trying to  give him wake up call to do his duty. but the press did not see it that way..George c scott. is a great actor,  you can tell he was born to play general patton! this is without a doubt the greatest role of his  career  i can see why this film won 7 academy awards and the best picture...it deserves it!this film is lavishly, produced with filming done in various european nations, as well as europe. this film is a feast for they eyes..its well acted, well produced..and most importantly well written..which sometimes hollywood these days seems to forget...  the dvd is fantastic  packaging and all,  you get a excellent digital copy, booklet, and tons of extras  such as the making of,  documentaries, and much more..and lets not forget the trailer...well done!

440234,A1QQPIUXWD4G0Z,6304935811,Octavius,"[5, 6]","...you make the other poor bastard die for his country instead!"" So opens the 1970 Oscar-winning film 'Patton' directed by Franklin J. Schaffner; giving the audience an early insight into the mind of one of America's greatest generals.  A well-directed film enhanced by the spectacular performance of George C. Scott who has an uncanny resemblance to the actual person.The film faithfully and candidly presents the life of America's most cunning WWII general as described by his fellow officer General Bradley in his memoirs and Patton's own autobiography.  The film shows how he was a commander whom even great German generals such as Erwin Rommel feared and respected.  It shows him as a controversial figure who, although an ardent Christian, believed in reincarnation.  Bellicose and foul mouthed, Patton was his own worst enemy in the Pentagon and on the political scene: foiling many opportunities for him to be assigned a command on the front.  The film also shows how he became a controversial leader with his own troops for reprimanding a shell-shocked soldier as a coward.  The film follows his exploits in Operation Torch in North Africa, the invasion of Sicily and Italy, and some of his activities in Northern Europe.  The film also shows how Patton had a pretty low opinion of Montgomery as a man and as a military commander: they were both bitter rivals throughout the war.This is not really a war film but strictly a dramatic biography on one whose business happened to be war.  The few combat action scenes in the film are decent and well balanced in contrast to the main character; the cinematography is also quite good.  Under good direction by Schaffner, George C. Scott delivers a winning performance to a role he was literally born to play.  A great film deserving an honored place in any war film buff's collection.",5,"""Anyone who says they'll die for their country is an idiot..",1092700800,"08 17, 2004",2004,1838,"['make', 'other', 'poor', 'bastard', 'die', 'country', 'instead', 'So', '1970', 'Oscar-winning', 'film', ""'Patton"", 'directed', 'Franklin', 'J.', 'Schaffner', 'giving', 'audience', 'early', 'insight', 'mind', 'one', 'America', 'greatest', 'generals', 'well-directed', 'film', 'enhanced', 'spectacular', 'performance', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'who', 'uncanny', 'resemblance', 'actual', 'person.The', 'film', 'faithfully', 'candidly', 'life', 'America', 'most', 'cunning', 'WWII', 'general', 'described', 'fellow', 'officer', 'General', 'Bradley', 'memoirs', 'Patton', 'own', 'autobiography', 'film', 'how', 'was', 'commander', 'whom', 'even', 'great', 'German', 'generals', 'such', 'Erwin', 'Rommel', 'feared', 'respected', 'controversial', 'figure', 'who', 'ardent', 'Christian', 'believed', 'reincarnation', 'Bellicose', 'foul', 'mouthed', 'Patton', 'was', 'own', 'worst', 'enemy', 'Pentagon', 'political', 'scene', 'foiling', 'many', 'opportunities', 'be', 'assigned', 'command', 'front', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'became', 'controversial', 'leader', 'own', 'troops', 'reprimanding', 'shell-shocked', 'soldier', 'coward', 'film', 'exploits', 'Operation', 'Torch', 'North', 'Africa', 'invasion', 'Sicily', 'Italy', 'activities', 'Northern', 'Europe', 'film', 'also', 'how', 'Patton', 'had', 'pretty', 'low', 'opinion', 'Montgomery', 'man', 'military', 'commander', 'were', 'bitter', 'rivals', 'war.This', 'not', 'really', 'war', 'film', 'strictly', 'dramatic', 'biography', 'one', 'business', 'happened', 'be', 'war', 'few', 'combat', 'action', 'scenes', 'film', 'are', 'decent', 'well', 'balanced', 'contrast', 'main', 'character', 'cinematography', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'good', 'direction', 'Schaffner', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'winning', 'performance', 'role', 'was', 'literally', 'born', 'play', 'great', 'film', 'deserving', 'honored', 'place', 'war', 'film', 'buff', 'collection']",N/A

Scott, who plays the iconic general. The film chronicles Patton's war years, as he was a man solely built for war, and does it rather well. Scott captures Patton perfectly. I remember watching this on television with my family and my aunt and uncle's family. Afterward my uncle commented that Scott so captured Patton that at one point he was going to go through the screen and say ""Goddammit, Cobleigh, go and put on a decent uniform, you slacker. And don't let me catch you like that again!"" Patton has only two major flaws: One, General Omar Bradley (Karl Malden in a great performance) is seen as Patton's friend. In reality he hated George. Patton was a far better general and informed Bradley that he thought Hitler would attack through the Ardennes, as her had in 1940. Bradley pooh-poohed it, and we all know what happened. Then it was left up to Patton to pull Bradley's cookies out of the fire. The other miscue in the film concerns the equipment. Patton is using M-24 Chaffee light tanks (introduced in 1944, but not really widely used in battle until the Korean War) and the Germans are using M47 and 48 tanks (nicknamed ""Pattons"", ironically). If a movie such as Kelly's Heroes, made the same year, can feature Shermans, why couldn't this high-budget, ""important"" picture? The Sherman was the prominent American tank of the war. As for the German tanks, I can understand not featuring Tigers (there is only one surviving Tiger), but they could have used Stugs, or Mark IVs. In fact, most of the Afrika Corps' armor consisted of Mark IVs. Other than that, it's a great movie. Michael Bates is wonderful as General Montgomery, and is the spitting image of him, even down to the voice. Monty and Patton, being both egomaniacs, were naturally in competition, but both agreed on one thing: they didn't like Ike. After one order Patton received from Ike, his disgust was written on his face, to which Montgomery replied. ""George, if you get an order you don't like, why don't you simply do what I do? Ignore it."" But by no means ignore this movie.",5,Outstanding But Historically Challenged,1285545600,"09 27, 2010",2010,2159,"['are', 'times', 'when', 'actor', 'play', 'role', 'was', 'born', 'play', 'Such', 'case', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'who', 'iconic', 'general', 'film', 'Patton', 'war', 'years', 'was', 'man', 'solely', 'built', 'war', 'rather', 'well', 'Scott', 'Patton', 'perfectly', 'remember', 'watching', 'television', 'family', 'aunt', 'uncle', 'family', 'Afterward', 'uncle', 'commented', 'Scott', 'so', 'captured', 'Patton', 'one', 'point', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'screen', 'say', 'Goddammit', 'Cobleigh', 'go', 'put', 'decent', 'uniform', 'slacker', 'do', ""n't"", 'let', 'catch', 'again', 'Patton', 'only', 'two', 'major', 'flaws', 'One', 'General', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'great', 'performance', 'seen', 'Patton', 'friend', 'reality', 'hated', 'George', 'Patton', 'was', 'far', 'better', 'general', 'informed', 'Bradley', 'thought', 'Hitler', 'would', 'attack', 'Ardennes', 'had', '1940', 'Bradley', 'pooh-poohed', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Then', 'was', 'left', 'up', 'Patton', 'pull', 'Bradley', 'cookies', 'fire', 'other', 'miscue', 'film', 'equipment', 'Patton', 'using', 'M-24', 'Chaffee', 'light', 'tanks', 'introduced', '1944', 'not', 'really', 'widely', 'used', 'battle', 'Korean', 'War', 'Germans', 'are', 'using', 'M47', '48', 'tanks', 'nicknamed', 'Pattons', 'ironically', 'movie', 'such', 'Kelly', 'Heroes', 'made', 'same', 'year', 'can', 'feature', 'Shermans', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'high-budget', 'important', 'picture', 'Sherman', 'was', 'prominent', 'American', 'tank', 'war', 'German', 'tanks', 'can', 'understand', 'not', 'featuring', 'Tigers', 'only', 'one', 'surviving', 'Tiger', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'Stugs', 'Mark', 'IVs', 'fact', 'most', 'Afrika', 'Corps', 'armor', 'consisted', 'Mark', 'IVs', 'Other', 'great', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'wonderful', 'General', 'Montgomery', 'spitting', 'image', 'even', 'down', 'voice', 'Monty', 'Patton', 'being', 'egomaniacs', 'were', 'naturally', 'competition', 'agreed', 'one', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'Ike', 'one', 'order', 'Patton', 'received', 'Ike', 'disgust', 'was', 'written', 'face', 'Montgomery', 'replied', 'George', 'get', 'order', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'why', 'do', ""n't"", 'simply', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'Ignore', 'means', 'ignore', 'movie']",N/A

440246,A2MJ2LPNNQ7LIP,6304935811,Phil Berardelli,"[0, 0]","Russell Crowe, Robert DeNiro and Daniel Day Lewis, eat your hearts out. George C. Scott's performance in this movie is the best by an actor. Ever. Period. End of story. It remains the standard for all time. He plays the famous World War II general, whose nickname was ""Old Blood and Guts,"" as a man without fear or even a shadow of doubt, but with an unmistakable human gleam in his eye. Patton was a flamboyant figure, but Scott's portrayal makes you feel as though you don't care what the real man was like - you could follow this guy anywhere. It's no love letter, however. Patton's flaws are clearly visible: his impatience, his penchant for drama, his tendency toward arrogance, and his deluded sense that he had been reincarnated many times. Winner of seven Oscars, including Best Picture, with Francis Ford Coppola's terrific script and Franklin Shaffner's brilliant direction, this is one of the landmarks in movie biographies. The battle sequences are enormous, using real planes, tanks and heavy guns - and this is decades before computer animation could supply such scope artificially. Shot in Spain and Morocco with a cast of thousands, Patton presents an immense tableau of men in war. This is literal; as in Lawrence of Arabia, women are almost completely absent from the story. The few female characters are marginal and only two of them even speak. Jerry Goldsmith contributed the glorious music fanfare, one of the greatest works for the movies, a rich thematic orchestration that reaches a thrilling crescendo in scenes leading up to the infamous Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 and provides a satisfying coda at the fadeout.

Scott just does not have the look or feel on World War 2.  First I will mention something about Scott's portrayal of Patton; he is too fat and his voice too deep for the real Patton.  If someone ever has the opportunity to listen to a recording of George S. Patton's voice you'll be struck about how effeminate it sounds.  Of course Scott's waste line also does no justice to the tall and trim Patton but that can be overlooked.  What is hard to overlook is that the film looks too much like the Spanish army on maneuvers than a World War II battle.Then there are the numerous historical inaccuracies in the film.  The most notable one is where Patton greets Montgomery in Messina.  Didn't happen!  Well I could go on.  For accuracy I would place ""Tora, Tora , Tora"" above Patton.  For fun I'd chose ""Patton.""

440248,A3HJAIFRRFHUAB,6304935811,"Phred ""Phred""","[1, 1]","In this case, the added features tell a story almost as interesting as the main character of the film biopic. The problem faced by the people backing the movie Patton, was how to retain the legitimate, military hero that was General Patton while appealing to a Viet Nam era anti-war America.Many of the people most closely tied to the book and film script had firsthand knowledge of the contributions General Patton made to the swift collapse of German defenders in the months between the Normandy Invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. The historic success of Patton's leadership sped the end of the Nazi fantasy that their Ardennes counter offensive would result in a German victory. These were truths worthy of a dramatic movie to honor a man of honor.However the market in which this movie would compete was one that had tired of conventional WWII movies and leery of patriotic clich&eacute;s and puffed up be-medaled egotists.The resulting movie was one promoted Gen George Patton as a man with two sides. One, a  writer of poetry, believer in reincarnation,  utilizing acting and bluffing to beat the system ... Two, a super patriot, fearless in his defiance of all of America's enemies, including temporary allies (the Soviets) and  willing to drive his men at any expense to achieve victory.Most people comment on the opening speech as one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history. This is a market decision and therefore not to be refuted. Even Actor George Scott, felt that this opening would set too high of a standard from his total role to succeed. For myself one of the most important quotes, and most of the Patton's dialogue has historic roots, to General Bradly is more telling of the real General's attitude about war.Bradley confronts Patton over his egotistical need to beat General Montgomery in the invasion of Sicily. Patton's reply is to ask Bradly to consider how many additional Americana might have died if they had not been pushed to achieve faster results. Part of Patton's warrior genius was in understanding that war can be wasteful of human unless fought in the manner most likely to force the enemy to surrender at a minimal cost to your own.Of the side to Patton not important to this movie, I mention the importance of his letters to his wife. In many of these we become aware of the real human. The letters make plan his prejudices, many unsupportable, and his humanity. A more nuanced and less bombastic movie would still prove that this was an American worthy of our respect.Also left out of the movie are one minor action by Patton to recover Allied prisoners including one of his in laws which failed in tragic proportions (this action is discussed in the movie extra features). Patton's involvement in the Huertgen Forest Campaign, where he was not in overall command, but neither his role nor the ultimate success of the action reflected the movie's sense of an unstoppable Patton. There are also more than a few opinions of Patton's role in and failure to appreciate the problem of the Siegfried Line. My point is that Hollywood had its story to sell and history its own debates.The movie Patton succeeds in staring its two sides of the historic General Patton. The included features add a lot to your appreciation of the living person. Overall Patton is a worthy night of entertainment. It set a much higher standard for war time biopics and is a great addition to the library of those seeking a chest thumping, America the Mighty experience.",4,A classic in Hollywood salesmanship Taking two sides and winning,1389484800,"01 12, 2014",2014,3491,"['case', 'added', 'features', 'tell', 'story', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'biopic', 'problem', 'faced', 'people', 'backing', 'movie', 'Patton', 'was', 'how', 'retain', 'legitimate', 'military', 'hero', 'was', 'General', 'Patton', 'appealing', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'anti-war', 'America.Many', 'people', 'most', 'closely', 'tied', 'book', 'film', 'script', 'had', 'firsthand', 'knowledge', 'contributions', 'General', 'Patton', 'made', 'swift', 'collapse', 'German', 'defenders', 'months', 'Normandy', 'Invasion', 'Battle', 'Bulge', 'historic', 'success', 'Patton', 'leadership', 'sped', 'end', 'Nazi', 'fantasy', 'Ardennes', 'counter', 'offensive', 'would', 'result', 'German', 'victory', 'were', 'truths', 'worthy', 'dramatic', 'movie', 'honor', 'man', 'honor.However', 'market', 'movie', 'would', 'compete', 'was', 'one', 'had', 'tired', 'conventional', 'WWII', 'movies', 'leery', 'patriotic', 'clich', 'eacute', 'puffed', 'up', 'be-medaled', 'egotists.The', 'resulting', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'promoted', 'Gen', 'George', 'Patton', 'man', 'two', 'sides', 'One', 'writer', 'poetry', 'believer', 'reincarnation', 'utilizing', 'acting', 'bluffing', 'beat', 'system', 'Two', 'super', 'patriot', 'fearless', 'defiance', 'America', 'enemies', 'including', 'temporary', 'allies', 'Soviets', 'willing', 'drive', 'men', 'expense', 'achieve', 'victory.Most', 'people', 'comment', 'opening', 'speech', 'one', 'most', 'iconic', 'scenes', 'Hollywood', 'history', 'market', 'decision', 'therefore', 'not', 'be', 'refuted', 'Even', 'Actor', 'George', 'Scott', 'felt', 'opening', 'would', 'set', 'too', 'high', 'standard', 'total', 'role', 'succeed', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'quotes', 'most', 'Patton', 'dialogue', 'historic', 'roots', 'General', 'Bradly', 'more', 'telling', 'real', 'General', 'attitude', 'war.Bradley', 'confronts', 'Patton', 'egotistical', 'need', 'beat', 'General', 'Montgomery', 'invasion', 'Sicily', 'Patton', 'reply', 'ask', 'Bradly', 'consider', 'how', 'many', 'additional', 'Americana', 'might', 'have', 'died', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'pushed', 'achieve', 'faster', 'results', 'Part', 'Patton', 'warrior', 'genius', 'was', 'understanding', 'war', 'can', 'be', 'wasteful', 'human', 'fought', 'manner', 'most', 'likely', 'force', 'enemy', 'surrender', 'minimal', 'cost', 'side', 'Patton', 'not', 'important', 'movie', 'mention', 'importance', 'letters', 'wife', 'many', 'become', 'aware', 'real', 'human', 'letters', 'make', 'plan', 'prejudices', 'many', 'unsupportable', 'humanity', 'more', 'nuanced', 'less', 'bombastic', 'movie', 'would', 'still', 'prove', 'was', 'American', 'worthy', 'respect.Also', 'left', 'movie', 'are', 'one', 'minor', 'action', 'Patton', 'recover', 'Allied', 'prisoners', 'including', 'one', 'laws', 'failed', 'tragic', 'proportions', 'action', 'discussed', 'movie', 'extra', 'features', 'Patton', 'involvement', 'Huertgen', 'Forest', 'Campaign', 'where', 'was', 'not', 'overall', 'command', 'role', 'ultimate', 'success', 'action', 'reflected', 'movie', 'sense', 'unstoppable', 'Patton', 'are', 'also', 'more', 'few', 'opinions', 'Patton', 'role', 'failure', 'appreciate', 'problem', 'Siegfried', 'Line', 'point', 'Hollywood', 'had', 'story', 'sell', 'history', 'own', 'debates.The', 'movie', 'Patton', 'staring', 'two', 'sides', 'historic', 'General', 'Patton', 'included', 'features', 'add', 'lot', 'appreciation', 'living', 'person', 'Overall', 'Patton', 'worthy', 'night', 'entertainment', 'set', 'much', 'higher', 'standard', 'war', 'time', 'biopics', 'great', 'addition', 'library', 'seeking', 'chest', 'thumping', 'America', 'Mighty', 'experience']",N/A

440252,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6304935811,Randy Keehn,"[4, 4]","One of the great movies of the 1970's was ""Patton"" with an outstanding preformance by George C. Scott.  It was a bit controversial at the time because it was shown to a general public that was seriously divided over the on-going Viet Nam War.  For many, the movie represented a glorification of war while, for others, it represented the power of the individual.  It was a favorite of then-President Nixon (which was another mark against it for some).  What it was for most of us was an excellent historical biography that displayed the best that Hollywood had to offer.There was a lot of technical achievement in the film and it won Oscars for Art/Set Direction, Sound, and Editing while losing out to ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" in the category of Special Visual Effects.  However, the most noteworthy aspect of the film was George C. Scott's title role performance.  He vividly portrays a determined, emotional, passionate man whose quick tongue and temper got him as much time in the dog house as in the spot light.  The movie portrays the dilemna of a brilliant general leading a citizen army.  No problem with the troops but they all had families and congressmen who seemed to have better ideas on how to do things.  Patton, the ultimate warrior, died shortly after WWII.  His portrayal in this movie makes one wonder if that wasn't for the best; who could imagine a peacetime Patton after what he had experienced?""Patton"" won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Direction (a relatively obscure Franklin Schaffner), Best Writing (Francis Ford Coppola) and, as no surprize, Best Actor.  George C. Scott actually declined the award although without all the hoopola of Marlon Brando.  Karl Malden gives an excellent preformance in his supporting role as General Omar Bradley.I hadn't seen this movie in many years until just recently.  Frankly, something about it seemed to have lost a bit of its' luster.  However, I watched it so many times back then that I could practically say the lines along with Scott.  More likely it was because the political and military climate had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.

This film isn't a biography of Patton, but it does show him during WWII.  Franklin Schaffner  portrays Patton in a more objective manner than usual with this type of  film.  This is one of the few films where you will like and dislike the  main character at the same time.On to the DVD.  The picture quality is  excellent, but there is some age evident in the print used.  This is an  early 16:9 enhanced disc by Fox, though the packaging does not indicate so.  There is a tad too much edge enhancement and it annoyed me, but it isn't  terribly intrusive.The sound is a remixed DD 5.1 track.  The surrounds  get quite a bit of use, but don't expect &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;  type sound here.  The soundtrack sounds a bit dated, and the ADR sounds  obvious when it appears.On Disc One, an audio essay by a Patton  historian is included and runs about 81 minutes.  It is not screen  specific, nor is it a commentary, so kudos to Fox for not saying that it  is.  Trailers for &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; &quot;Patton,&quot; and  &quot;The Longest Day&quot; are included also.  A French mono track and  Spanish subtitles are included.Disc Two contains a documentary on the  filming of &quot;Patton&quot; which runs about 50 minutes.  It was included  on a previous LaserDisc release of the film, but given that it is on a  separate disc, they could have lengthened it.  An option to play the  isolated score from &quot;Patton&quot; is included, which will run over the  documentary if selected.  Only about 30 minutes of the film were scored, so  including the isolated score on Disc One would have left a lot of silence  during passages.Fox has a winner on their hands with &quot;Patton,&quot;  with its good video/audio quality and fairly good extras.

Schaffner's control of his film is impressive, and the various campaign sequences are strikingly photographed through an audaciously wide lens...George C. Scott was commonly referred to as a 'character actor' in view of his remarkably extensive range... Oddly for a character actor, Scott was almost always the same person on screen vigorous to the point of pugnacity, acting with his chin the way other actors do with their eyes-yet revealing, in his own eyes, unsuspected depths of humor and intelligence...Now few actors have ever been so convincing in such a powerful and colorful character... Only Peter 0'Toole's eccentric T.E. Lawrence comes immediately to mind... Both, he and Scott, create their characters out of complementary contradictions... Lawrence detests the savagery of war but embraces it... Patton cannot separate the conduct of war from his own personal glorification, and both actors are given large canvases upon which to work...Screenwriters Francis Ford Coppola and Edmund H. North and director Franklin J. Schaffner introduce a 16th-century warrior lost in contemporary times... He is a brilliant and military historian, with a hazardous speech...Magnificently uniformed, and wearing his ivory-handled pistol, George S. Patton steps up, against a backdrop of the Stars and Stripes, before an unseen gathering of soldiers defining himself in unambiguous terms as a man who revels in war... The scene is cut to a close shot of two scorpions crawling across the body of a dead soldier at the Kasserine Pass, Tunisia... The camera then pulls back to reveal a harsh look at American casualties with dozens of Arabs busily stripping more bodies...The American Army has just suffered its first defeat at the hands of the Germans... Patton's first job is to restore the morale and discipline of the dispirited troops of his new command... His experience with tanks led General Dwight Eisenhower to place him in charge of one of the three task forces invading North Africa in 1943...According to his theory of war, Patton would drive all the way to Palermo on the northern coast of Sicily, slicing the island in half... But his finest moment comes during the massive German counteroffensive in the Ardennes... By the time the Germans feared him above all other Allied generals...Schaffner turns to the Germans for comments on Patton's abilities... They expect him to lead a major invasion... When he was sent to Corsica, the Germans were convinced he would lead an invasion of southern France... When he was sent to Cairo, they feared for an invasion through the Balkans...Patton is seen reprimanded by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for indiscreet political statements... As an able tactician who promotes himself to three-star general before it's officially approved by the U.S. Senate, Patton proves himself as the most effective American field commander of the European war... Behind his audacity lay an imaginative planning and a shrewd judgment... Patton knows that loyalty to a leader would inspire his men to take on objectives against all odds... His strict discipline, toughness, and disregard of classic military rules, contributed to his advance across France and Germany...The modest and conscientious Omar Bradley, commander of the U.S. 12th Army Group, who had served under Patton in Africa and Sicily as a deputy commander, found Patton to be a superb combat general, but hotheaded, profane, and unpredictable... Bradley ends now as Patton's superior... It was soon apparent that the two make a superb team... Patton's dash and drive in the field is a perfect complement to Bradley's careful planning...With the help of Bradley, Patton prepares to re-engage German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel... After he defeats Rommel's 10th Panzer Division at El Guettar thanks to his analysis of Rommel's published strategies, he shouts one of the greatest lines in war films: ""Rommel, you magnificent bastard, I read your book!"" At the same time, his rivalry with his Field Marshal Montgomery (hero of El Alamein) becomes more intense... Patton was motivated by a pride to reach his target before his British colleague, sometimes not for the purpose of the Allies...Karl Malden has the film's only other significant leading role, as the most capable, yet unpretentious general... Malden could be deduced from the number of major directors with whom he has worked... These include Cukor, Hathaway, Kazan, King, Preminger, Milestone, Vidor, Hitchcock, Brooks, Mulligan, Daves, Brando, Frankenheimer, Ford, Quine and Schaffner... In his best and most personal work he has succeeded in exploring depths of moral ambiguity rare in commercial cinema...Schaffner illuminates various sides of Patton's remarkable personality, presenting a dashing extrovert and attractive general, with a compassionate side...Touring an evacuation hospital in Sicily, Patton slaps an enlisted soldier twice calling him a 'yellow,' and threatens to shoot him, before two men forcibly remove him from the tent... The incident occurs because Patton's views of bravery and cowardice are so severely limited... The fighting general who has the imagination to write poetry and to believe that he has been reincarnated, in ancient Greece, at Carthage, and Moscow, cannot conceive of a psychological wound that he cannot see... The incident occurred after he prays at the bedside of one man severely injured... Patton whispers some words in his ear which the audience doesn't hear, then lays a medal on his pillow and gives him a gentle touch on his head... The portrait is so compelling that it's easy to overlook Patton's own final words in the film, ""All glory is fleeting.""Franklin J. Schaffner's motion picture reveals an effective portrait of three men: Patton, Bradley, and the unseen Dwight Eisenhower... The film is a fine epic about 'a pure warrior, and a magnificent anachronism,' who loved war...The Academy Awards saluted 'Patton' capturing eight Oscars, including best picture, best director, best actor (Scott declined his well deserved Oscar), best screenplay, best editing, and best production design...",5,"A fine epic about a ""pure warrior.""",1168473600,"01 11, 2007",2007,6173,"['war',

Scott for his total immersion into, and his passionate portrayal of the character of George Patton--sometimes at the expense of the other actors appearing in the same scenes. However, this great movie is about the man, General Patton; it is not about an event during World War II, like Pearl Harbor, D-Day, or the saving of Private Ryan. It would be only natural for Scott to dominate the film.Even so, there is something about this movie that does work on a grand scale. The battle sequences, although at times historically inaccurate, are absorbing and gripping nonetheless. Patton's strategies are beyond reproach. His unflinching courage, as dive bombers take aim at him, as gunners shoot at him, as a plane falls in flames just over his head, are cinematic testimony to this perfect general.Fortunately, the filmmakers also show us the man warts-and-all. He was a media manipulator. He also manipulated his own superiors when he sought fame and glory. He was totally self-absorbed and defiantly impatient.There are better World War II movies out there, undoubtedly. But any collection of WWII films that omits this movie is woefully incomplete.

Scott's gritty portrayal of a man who, more than anything, wanted to go to war that was fascinating.  Most characters in a role like this usually payed at least lip service to the idea that war was the wrong thing to do, but we really don't have a choice so we need to do the best we can.  Not Patton.  He felt he was a reincarnated soldier from most of the wars over the last several thousand years and he didn't pretend he thought otherwise.  He had a barroom vocabulary, an unwelcome big mouth to the political crowd, and a demanding nature--but, when you needed someone to arrive in the nick of time to stop the Nazi's final push and save your troops from total annihilation, he was your man.

440277,A2XRMQA6PJ5ZJ8,6304935811,Roger J. Buffington,"[9, 12]","""Patton"" is an epic saga of one of the greatest generals of all time, a total American, and an imperfect but nonetheless great man.  George C. Scott as General George S. Patton is one of the greatest and best casting decisions of all time.  Scott becomes the general, and the role will forever define Scott, just as Scott's portrayal of General Patton will forever define the General in the minds of most Americans.This is a wonderful movie about a flawed but great man.  Like many or most American generals, Patton waited the better part of his career for a terrible war to occur, which would call forth all of the years of training and preparation, but mostly waiting, that go into the career of a professional soldier who happens to serve a basically peace-loving country.  Patton believed that he was born to lead great armies in a desperate battle, and this he did.  The film's depiction of Patton when he took over the Vth Corps in North Africa shortly after it took a shellacking from Rommel at Kassarine Pass was absolutely masterful.  Patton took a despirited, green American army there, and shortly, in his words, turned them into ""razors ... fanatics!""  The American Expeditionary Force in North Africa never lost another battle after the brush at Kassarine, and Patton was established in the American mind as a great war general.The infamous ""slapping incident"" was portrayed painfully but, in the end, according to most historians, accurately.  Patton here is shown to have exercised misjudgment, but even here the discerning viewer will see that this was a misguided attempt by the general to inspirit a flagging soldier.  Scott handled this particular scene perfectly, as indeed he did the entire three hour film.Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when Patton leads the Third Army's relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne.  The British and other allied forces were paralyzed--Patton, having anticipated the possibility of a surprise German winter attack, wheeled several divisions 90 degrees, disengaged from the front, and attacked the advancing Germans in force, which broke the back of the German spearhead and won the Battle of the Bulge for the Americans.  The scene in this film where Scott/Patton ""orders"" an Army Chaplain to ""pray to the Almighty for good weather...I want a good weather prayer..."" is one wonderful scene, juxtaposed against horrendous scenes of combat as the Americans, tired but battle-hardened, advanced.Patton's difficulties with the press are well done in this film, and one wonders, with today's media the way it is, whether a great general like Patton could survive in our politicized times.  Lord help us when the day comes, as it will, when America needs another Patton.Scott's portrayal of Patton is one of the greatest character roles ever, and this is a great war film and character study of a great American general.The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic, and is one of those scores that greatly adds to the viewing experience of the film.  The DVD is an excellent reproduction of the film, and the sound is recreated/remastered into pretty good Dolby 5.1, which sounded great on my home theater system, if not quite as awesome as some modern films.  This is a great film and the DVD is a great value.",5,One of the great ones!

I served the bulk of my Army time with the 1st Armour Division at Fort Hood Texas and after my military discharge I did a little research about the tank division. Whenever I would see old film footage of World War 2 and the U.S. tank divisions, images of General George S. Patton as commander are proudly shown. As the tanks knock down the walls of various Nazi concentration camps, Patton and his tank division are first to get there. The film shows some foot soldiers and some other military officers as they tour the camps but they never show Patton's tank drivers, the soldiers who executed all of Patton's heroic deeds. Being a black soldier myself, I always look for the black soldiers in all military war films of World War 2 to gain a better understanding of their roles during the war. I look for them in Army, Marines, Air Force and Navy films of W.W. 2. On most of the war footage I have seen, the black troops are edited out of the film footage. They are edited out of the authentic Patton war footage and they are completely edited out of the Patton movie with George C. Scott. General Patton's complete division was comprised of black troops. Patton himself was very proud of his troops and they were the pride of the entire armour division. The only black soldier in the whole Patton movie was Patton's personal jeep driver which was probably intended to be an insult to the real heroes who served. I am not a historian or a civil rights authority but I know the truth from a fable and the film Patton is a fable. George C. Scott, Karl Malden and all of the actors did a first rate job of acting here but all and only to propagate a 7 Oscar lie. 1 star.",1,Patton's tank division was comprised of BLACK TROOPS.

George Smith Patton (1885-1945) delivering his rah-rah-troops sermon before the gigantic awe-inspiring American flag, this 1970 film is a wonderful character depiction of a complicated hero. Always true to his ideals, which include his self-confessed inability to keep his ""big mouth shut,"" he incurred the wrath of his good buddy ""Ike"" and Omar Bradley, brilliantly played by Karl Malden (b. 1912).Patton was also feared but ultimately revered by his soldiers, as well as arch-enemy Erwin Rommel, ""The Desert Fox."" Rommel, in fact, studied Patton's character and was fascinated that Patton wrote poetry and believed in reincarnation.Unforgettable scenes include Patton ordering the driver of his Jeep to a graveyard in Tunisia. ""There's no graveyard there, sir,"" said his driver. ""There is,"" said Patton. ""I fought there.""He believed that, in a former life, he was the great Carthaginian general Hannibal, and was saddened by Hannibal's brilliance and loss. As a child, Patton was well versed with bios of military heroes as far back as in the immortal Iliad.Another memorable scene has the raspy-voiced Patton ordering the Chaplain to pray for good weather. Although a general can motivate his troops only so far, the weather must cooperate - it didn't, Patton confided to the Chaplain, and Napolean lost at Waterloo. Not surprisingly, Patton believed he was one of Napoleon's soldiers. Patton's order of prayer had the lucky coincidence of stopping a snowstorm in its tracks so Patton's Third Army could advance in victory.In the midst of deadly battle where Patton views himself as utterly invincible, he remarks, ""God, I love it here!"" Every nuance of the noble, arrogant, elitist, insubordinately lovable general is brilliantly portrayed by George C. Scott (1927-1999). At age 43, Scott famously declined his Oscar award for best actor stating the Oscars were nothing but a ""meat market."" Patton, on the other hand, adored the accoutrements of power: his numerous medals and celebratory garments including polished helmet, ivory pistol and riding jodhpurs!One of the greatest films ever made, with wonderfully little blood and gore, what would the real George Smith Patton think of the ridiculous war raging overseas today in Iraq?

Patton Jr.'s entire life, only the last three years, starting from when he landed in Casablanca, Morocco in November of 1942 until relieved of his command of the 3rd Army in October of 1945.  The movie mainly highlights his exploits in the above mentioned countries in WWII.  In North Africa, he and the British General Bernard Montgomery were on the trail of tanks sped along by the German General Erwin Rommel and his Afrika Korps.  Later in Sicily, he and Montgomery raced each other to take Messina fighting the Germans along the way.  During that time, the infamous slapping incident of a soldier occurred which would haunt his career to the end.  Once in continental europe, Patton's 3rd Army would lead a blistering pace to liberate the beseiged city of Bastogne, Belgium, on the border of Luxembourg, and the entrapped U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division on Christmas day.  The movie captures Patton's personality in the military arena, that part of his life that was his heart and soul.  In the movie, he describes himself as a ""combat soldier"", and it is all too clear that he is deeply hurt when benched by his commanding officers to not fight at places like Normandy.  Indeed, it seems he was more hurt and angered by orders not to fight than by orders to answer to his subordinate, General Bradley (Karl Malden), who was promoted to Patton's position.  The story for this movie is based on two books, one written by General Bradley himself; the title for this review is a comment Bradley once made about Patton.  In the movie, the relations between Bradley and Patton (George C. Scott) were always good; General Bradley, in the film, saves Patton's life by pushing him out of the way of a runaway ox cart that finally crashed into a parked jeep, a foreshadowing of how Patton was to die a few months later.  Patton died on December 21, 1945 after having been in a coma for 12 days following an automobile accident in Germany when a U.S. army truck crashed into his car.  This dvd has within it a chronology of Patton's entire life, mentioning his exploits in the first world war and his competing in the 1912 Olympics in the modern pentathlon.  He was buried in Hamm in Luxembourg, fitting, in that the people of Luxembourg still regard Patton and his 3rd Army as their liberator.  I love this movie.  I could watch this movie over and over until the real doomsday!  It is biased toward the Four star General Patton somewhat, however, historians seem to agree that he was America's greatest military commander.  There is no adult material in this movie, the ""F"" word is not said, however, all of the ""B"" word expletives are.  In fact, the first one is said after the 11th or 12th word to come out of Patton's renowned trash mouth at the beginning of the movie, so be forewarned!  Trash mouth aside, I give this movie 5 stars; I give the real Patton 5 stars-FIVE STARS!!!What I loved most about Patton which this movie brings out was his knowledge of history.  He not only studied the past, as Confucius urges (my favorite quote-see my review of Swords, Ships, and Sugar), he lived it and relived it since he firmly believed in reincarnation.  One of my favorite scenes is the one where he makes his driver turn in the wrong direction and leads himself and Bradley to the ruins of Carthage in North Africa.  He has a flashback of what actually transpired, explaining everything that happened there on that battlefield 2000 years ago.  Spooky stuff, and probably explains Bradley's quote, my title for this review.  Was Patton a child of God?  I think so.  If God can give visions and dreams of the future, can he give visions of the past???  Interesting.  (I personally don't believe in reincarnation, it's not in my bible, yet I don't think it's a critical issue).  My favorite reply of Patton's in this movie was his answer to a priest who asked if Patton read the bible he kept by his bed.  He replies, ""Ev'ry God d--ned day!!!""  Me, too!!! ME TOO!!!The reporters and journalists who swarmed around Patton, particularly after the slapping incident, reminded me so much of the scribes, pharisees, spies, who hounded Jesus, ready to twist and turn around every word that was said to nail him on.  I loved the bible verses that were read while he was walking out to meet the newsies which are from Psalm 63, probably from the English Standard Version.  The last verse, my favorite, reads: But the king shall rejoice in God; all who swear by him shall exult, for the mouths of liars will be stopped.",5,"""The strangest duck I have ever known""-Omar Bradley",1098403200,"10 22, 2004",2004,4591,"['Tunisia-Sicily-LuxembourgPatton', 'movie', 'not', 'chronicle', 'General', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'Jr.', 'entire', 'life', 'only', 'last', 'three', 'years', 'starting', 'when', 'landed', 'Casablanca', 'Morocco', 'November', '1942', 'relieved', 'command', '3rd', 'Army', 'October', '1945', 'movie', 'mainly', 'exploits', 'above', 'mentioned', 'countries', 'WWII', 'North', 'Africa', 'British', 'General', 'Bernard', 'Montgomery', 'were', 'trail', 'tanks', 'sped', 'German', 'General', 'Erwin', 'Rommel', 'Afrika', 'Korps', 'Later', 'Sicily', 'Montgomery', 'raced', 'other', 'take', 'Messina', 'fighting', 'Germans', 'way', 'time', 'infamous', 'slapping', 'incident', 'soldier', 'occurred', 'would', 'haunt', 'career', 'end', 'Once', 'continental', 'europe', 'Patton', '3rd', 'Army', 'would', 'lead', 'blistering', 'pace', 'liberate', 'beseiged', 'city', 'Bastogne', 'Belgium', 'border', 'Luxembourg', 'entrapped', 'U.S.', 'Army', '101st', 'Airborne', 'Division', 'Christmas', 'day', 'movie', 'Patton', 'personality', 'military', 'arena', 'part', 'life', 'was', 'heart', 'soul', 'movie', 'combat', 'soldier', 'too', 'clear', 'deeply', 'hurt', 'when', 'benched', 'commanding', 'officers', 'not', 'fight', 'places', 'Normandy', 'Indeed', 'was', 'more', 'hurt', 'angered', 'orders', 'not', 'fight', 'orders', 'answer', 'subordinate', 'General', 'Bradley', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'who', 'was', 'promoted', 'Patton', 'position', 'story', 'movie', 'based', 'two', 'books', 'one', 'written', 'General', 'Bradley', 'title', 'review', 'comment', 'Bradley', 'once', 'made', 'Patton', 'movie', 'relations', 'Bradley', 'Patton', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'were', 'always', 'good', 'General', 'Bradley', 'film', 'Patton', 'life', 'pushing', 'way', 'runaway', 'ox', 'cart', 'finally', 'crashed', 'parked', 'jeep', 'foreshadowing', 'how', 'Patton', 'was', 'die', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'Patton', 'died', 'December', '21', '1945', 'having', 'been', 'coma', '12', 'days', 'following', 'automobile', 'accident', 'Germany', 'when', 'U.S.', 'army', 'truck', 'crashed', 'car', 'dvd', 'chronology', 'Patton', 'entire', 'life', 'mentioning', 'exploits', 'first', 'world', 'war', 'competing', '1912', 'Olympics', 'modern', 'pentathlon', 'was', 'buried', 'Hamm', 'Luxembourg', 'fitting', 'people', 'Luxembourg', 'still', 'regard', 'Patton', '3rd', 'Army', 'liberator', 'love', 'movie', 'could', 'watch', 'movie', 'real', 'doomsday', 'biased', 'Four', 'star', 'General', 'Patton', 'somewhat', 'however', 'historians', 'seem', 'agree', 'was', 'America', 'greatest', 'military', 'commander', 'adult', 'material', 'movie', 'F', 'word', 'not', 'said', 'however', 'B', 'word', 'expletives', 'are', 'fact', 'first', 'one', 'said', '11th', '12th', 'word', 'come', 'Patton', 'renowned', 'trash', 'mouth', 'beginning', 'movie', 'so', 'be', 'forewarned', 'Trash', 'mouth', 'aside', 'give', 'movie', '5', 'stars', 'give', 'real', 'Patton', '5', 'stars-FIVE', 'STARS', 'What', 'loved', 'most', 'Patton', 'movie', 'out', 'was', 'knowledge', 'history', 'not', 'only', 'studied', 'past', 'Confucius', 'favorite', 'quote-see', 'review', 'Swords', 'Ships', 'Sugar', 'lived', 'relived', 'firmly', 'believed', 'reincarnation', 'One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'one', 'where', 'driver', 'turn', 'wrong', 'direction', 'Bradley', 'ruins', 'Carthage', 'North', 'Africa', 'flashback', 'what', 'actually', 'transpired', 'explaining', 'everything', 'happened', 'there', 'battlefield', '2000', 'years', 'ago', 'Spooky', 'stuff', 'probably', 'Bradley', 'quote', 'title', 'review', 'Was', 'Patton', 'child', 'God', 'think', 'so', 'God', 'can', 'give', 'visions', 'dreams', 'future', 'can', 'give', 'visions', 'past', 'Interesting', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reincarnation', 'not', 'bible', 'yet', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'critical', 'issue', 'favorite', 'reply', 'Patton', 'movie', 'was', 'answer', 'priest', 'who', 'asked', 'Patton', 'read', 'bible', 'kept', 'bed', ""Ev'ry"", 'God', 'd', 'ned', 'day', 'Me', 'too', 'ME', 'TOO', 'reporters', 'journalists', 'who', 'swarmed', 'Patton', 'particularly', 'slapping', 'incident', 'reminded', 'so', 'much', 'scribes', 'pharisees', 'spies', 'who', 'hounded', 'Jesus', 'ready', 'twist', 'turn', 'around', 'word', 'was', 'said', 'nail', 'loved', 'bible', 'verses', 'were', 'read', 'was', 'walking', 'out', 'meet', 'newsies', 'are', 'Psalm', '63', 'probably', 'English', 'Standard', 'Version', 'last', 'verse', 'favorite', 'reads', 'king', 'shall', 'rejoice', 'God', 'who', 'swear', 'shall', 'exult', 'mouths', 'liars', 'will', 'be', 'stopped']",N/A

The DVD is great with a large choice of languages and special features.  I did not understand why, when I clicked on the ""audio history of Patton"" that the DVD returned me to the film.  Very odd.  Despite that anomaly, the film is quite well done.It's a long movie, almost three hours.  But you're not aware of the time as you really become part of the action.The battle scenes, the tanks and the unfortunate end of some of the soldiers was hard to watch.  The realism of the film was further augmented by the excellent acting:  Patton as the gruff, can't-keep-his-mouth-shut SOB, who has very sharp opinions of the Nazi's, the soldier who he gives the Purple Heart, and the berating he gives to another for being a coward, including pulling out his Colt pistols to put the kid out of his misery!You are on the battlefield as Patton recalls his earlier lives fighting with the Romans as they took Carthage, reminiscing as he gives Rommel a run for his money, and the humorous exchange with his British rival, Montgomery, as they take Sicily and eventually the overthrow of the Third Reich.Recommended, especially for WWII buffs.

Scott--simply brilliant here--and director Franklin Schaffner that the celebrated general of ""Patton's"" title comes across more the tragic hero and less the right-wing nutjob, especially considering that the film debuted in 1970.  ""Patton"" is worth a look for that bit of storytelling finesse alone, but the film offers much more, effectively examining both the highs and lows of the headstrong general's World War II days.  Though it lacks the poetic grandeur of epics like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""How the West Was Won,"" ""Patton"" nonetheless operates on a big scale, and Scott's larger-than-life portrayal is never obscured by the production's legions of soldiers or frequent changes of scenery.  The script, co-written by Francis Ford Coppola, stays focused on the professional aspects of Patton's life--his devotion to duty, command, and career--and wisely avoids bogging down with diversions into romance or family life.  Some might find such an approach imbalanced, but most viewers will likely enjoy the ""purity"" of what is, for lack of a better term, a satisfying ""guy's story.""  Look for Karl Malden in a great supporting role as Omar Bradley, and enjoy Jerry Goldsmith's bombastic score, rivaled only by John Williams' Indiana Jones overtures.  Still, ""Patton"" is not without faults.  Military buffs may bemoan some technical inaccuracies, such as using tanks that don't fit the historical period; at times, the characterizations devolve into caricature, especially that of British General Montgomery; and some of Patton's borderline psychotic behavior--his various rages and obsessions with dreams and reincarnation--seem too easily dismissed as colorful idiosyncracies.

In addition to the virtuoso acting of George C. Scott -- which somehow never seems to fall into melodrama despite his bombast -- the film explores perhaps better than any other the attraction and the repulsion we feel towards the bloodthirsty glory hound warrior that Patton epitomized. At first blush, we see Patton before the flag in a powerful speech where he is larger than life -- an American counterpoint to Hitler and the awful pomp of the Nazis that seduced millions into evil. Patton surely has the capacity for evil -- note his preoccupation with Napoleon and his putting victory and glory over the blood of his men, and his absolute love of war and destruction. But throughout the film he inspires, cajoles and whips his men into an efficient fighting machine. We are both attracted by this and repelled at the same time. Patton becomes a valuable weapon, but must be muzzled at the end because he does not know how to stop and has no patience for civility. A man like Patton, if he had become president instead of Eisenhower, could have destroyed worlds if it meant his name writ large in the history books. And yet, men like Patton protected and served the country well, and indeed were essential to winning the war.Like Churchill, Patton was cast off after the war. The people here and in Britain seemed to understand that a far different kind of leadership is needed in peacetime than in war.***As for the movie, the war scenes themselves are merely scene-setters rather than scene-stealers the way it would be if it were done today.

There are relatively few on-the-battlefield action scenes of consequence, and the soldiers themselves come off not as human beings so much as props for the generals, pieces on a chessboard. But that's all to the well and good. Patton didn't see his men as individuals so much as a means to an end. Because we don't get to know them too closely, it helps us understand, a bit, how Patton was able to spend their lives so easily as he focused on his goals of victory and glory.",5,Powerful portrait is a must-see,1122422400,"07 27, 2005",2005,2201,"[""'Patton"", 'more', 'thrill', 'ride', 'more', 'spectacle', 'more', 'just', 'garden', 'variety', 'WWII', 'epic', 'addition', 'virtuoso', 'acting', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'somehow', 'never', 'fall', 'melodrama', 'bombast', 'film', 'perhaps', 'better', 'other', 'attraction', 'repulsion', 'feel', 'bloodthirsty', 'glory', 'hound', 'warrior', 'Patton', 'epitomized', 'first', 'blush', 'see', 'Patton', 'flag', 'powerful', 'speech', 'where', 'larger', 'life', 'American', 'counterpoint', 'Hitler', 'awful', 'pomp', 'Nazis', 'seduced', 'millions', 'evil', 'Patton', 'surely', 'capacity', 'evil', 'note', 'preoccupation', 'Napoleon', 'putting', 'victory', 'glory', 'blood', 'men', 'absolute', 'love', 'war', 'destruction', 'film', 'cajoles', 'whips', 'men', 'efficient', 'fighting', 'machine', 'are', 'attracted', 'repelled', 'same', 'time', 'Patton', 'valuable', 'weapon', 'must', 'be', 'muzzled', 'end', 'not', 'know', 'how', 'stop', 'patience', 'civility', 'man', 'Patton', 'had', 'become', 'president', 'instead', 'Eisenhower', 'could', 'have', 'destroyed', 'worlds', 'meant', 'name', 'writ', 'large', 'history', 'books', 'yet', 'men', 'Patton', 'protected', 'served', 'country', 'well', 'indeed', 'were', 'essential', 'winning', 'war.Like', 'Churchill', 'Patton', 'was', 'cast', 'off', 'war', 'people', 'here', 'Britain', 'seemed', 'understand', 'far', 'different', 'kind', 'leadership', 'needed', 'peacetime', 'war', '***As', 'movie', 'war', 'are', 'merely', 'scene-setters', 'rather', 'scene-stealers', 'way', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'done', 'today', ""n't"", 'Bridge', 'River', 'Kwai', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'Pearl', 'Harbor', 'are', 'relatively', 'few', 'on-the-battlefield', 'action', 'scenes', 'consequence', 'soldiers', 'come', 'off', 'not', 'human', 'beings', 'so', 'much', 'props', 'generals', 'pieces', 'chessboard', 'well', 'good', 'Patton', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'men', 'individuals', 'so', 'much', 'means', 'end', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'too', 'closely', 'understand', 'bit', 'how', 'Patton', 'was', 'able', 'spend', 'lives', 'so', 'easily', 'focused', 'goals', 'victory', 'glory']",N/A

That might be seen as something of an exaggeration but for the fact that he features in virtually every scene.  Similarly, though principally by his admirers, the same might be said about the eponymous general whom Scott embodies as though born to play this one role alone.  In a remarkably nuanced performance, given the characteristics of the man he plays, Scott allows the more sensitive side of Patton's character to appear from time to time and even, though for the briefest of moments, elements of self-doubt and self-recrimination as, for example, he is informed of the plight of American troops landing amphibiously during the battle for Messina or kissing the forehead of an American captain following a ten hour vicious encounter with a German armoured column during the Battle of the Bulge.However, central to all that happens for the last two thirds of the film is the infamous `slapping' incident following which, on Eisenhower's order, Patton has to apologize to the assembled `offendees' including the doctors and nurses, in addition to the slapped soldier, but still manages to accuse the latter of cowardice in so doing!  He certainly had a way with words but not one best geared to achieve his ultimate purpose, which was to occupy a pivotal role in the upcoming thrust into Nazi Germany.  In fact he is relieved of his command of the 7th Army (Western Task Force, Operation Husky) and has to make do with being merely a decoy back in England to fool the Nazi high command into thinking he was preparing to lead the assault on mainland Europe via the Pas de Calais.Eventually, after more or less being on his `best behaviour', Patton is given command of 3rd Army, who play a supportive role in Northern France following Operation Overlord, while Omar Bradley (played by Karl Malden) is given command of 12th Army Group.  One can only wonder, in terms of shortening the war, what might have transpired had Patton kept his mouth shut, his hands to himself and their roles been reversed.The film doesn't seek to mitigate any of Patton's `transgressions' and Scott's towering performance shows Patton in all his belligerent glory.  He receives excellent support from Malden in the other major role and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Michael Bates, as Monty.  But what the film does do is to convey, unambiguously, Patton's sense of personal destiny as if he'd been born for this moment in history: a trait he almost certainly shared with Churchill.The combat scenes are handled magnificently and the viewer gets a real feel for the sweep and scope of battle with men and machines being manipulated by both sides like pieces on a chessboard.  Added to this is the gloriously (now) iconic score by Jerry Goldsmith.  All in all an epic war film that, by the end, leaves one with the feeling; `they don't make `em like this anymore'!",5,Cometh the hour cometh the man!,1397088000,"04 10, 2014",2014,3018,"['considering', 'Scott', 'performance', 'brilliant', 'film', 'was', 'put', 'mind', 'Cassius', 'words', 'regarding', 'Caesar', 'whom', 'bestriding', 'world', 'colossus', 'might', 'be', 'seen', 'something', 'exaggeration', 'fact', 'virtually', 'scene', 'Similarly', 'principally', 'admirers', 'same', 'might', 'be', 'said', 'eponymous', 'general', 'whom', 'Scott', 'born', 'play', 'one', 'role', 'alone', 'remarkably', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'given', 'characteristics', 'man', 'Scott', 'more', 'sensitive', 'side', 'Patton', 'character', 'appear', 'time', 'time', 'even', 'briefest', 'moments', 'elements', 'self-doubt', 'self-recrimination', 'example', 'informed', 'plight', 'American', 'troops', 'landing', 'amphibiously', 'battle', 'Messina', 'kissing', 'forehead', 'American', 'captain', 'following', 'ten', 'hour', 'vicious', 'encounter', 'German', 'armoured', 'column', 'Battle', 'Bulge.However', 'central', 'last', 'two', 'thirds', 'film', 'infamous', 'slapping', 'incident', 'following', 'Eisenhower', 'order', 'Patton', 'apologize', 'assembled', 'offendees', 'including', 'doctors', 'nurses', 'addition', 'slapped', 'soldier', 'still', 'accuse', 'latter', 'cowardice', 'so', 'doing', 'certainly', 'had', 'way', 'words', 'not', 'one', 'best', 'geared', 'achieve', 'ultimate', 'purpose', 'was', 'occupy', 'pivotal', 'role', 'upcoming', 'thrust', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'fact', 'relieved', 'command', '7th', 'Army', 'Western', 'Task', 'Force', 'Operation', 'Husky', 'make', 'do', 'being', 'merely', 'decoy', 'back', 'England', 'fool', 'Nazi', 'high', 'command', 'thinking', 'was', 'preparing', 'lead', 'assault', 'mainland', 'Europe', 'Pas', 'de', 'Calais.Eventually', 'more', 'less', 'being', 'best', 'behaviour', 'Patton', 'given', 'command', '3rd', 'Army', 'who', 'play', 'supportive', 'role', 'Northern', 'France', 'following', 'Operation', 'Overlord', 'Omar', 'Bradley', 'played', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'given', 'command', '12th', 'Army', 'Group', 'One', 'can', 'only', 'wonder', 'terms', 'shortening', 'war', 'what', 'might', 'have', 'transpired', 'had', 'Patton', 'kept', 'mouth', 'shut', 'hands', 'roles', 'been', 'reversed.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'seek', 'mitigate', 'Patton', 'transgressions', 'Scott', 'towering', 'performance', 'shows', 'Patton', 'belligerent', 'glory', 'excellent', 'support', 'Malden', 'other', 'major', 'role', 'somewhat', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'Monty', 'what', 'film', 'do', 'convey', 'unambiguously', 'Patton', 'sense', 'personal', 'destiny', ""'d"", 'been', 'born', 'moment', 'history', 'trait', 'almost', 'certainly', 'shared', 'Churchill.The', 'combat', 'scenes', 'are', 'handled', 'magnificently', 'viewer', 'real', 'feel', 'sweep', 'scope', 'battle', 'men', 'machines', 'being', 'manipulated', 'sides', 'pieces', 'chessboard', 'Added', 'gloriously', 'now', 'iconic', 'score', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'epic', 'war', 'film', 'end', 'one', 'feeling', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'em', 'anymore']",N/A

As soon as the opening scene begins it's cuts to the close ups of Patton's uniform just prior to his opening speech you know this is the highest level of detail and color accuracy you have ever witnessed for this film.  The dynamic range of the picture and the beautiful color will continue to surprise you.  I doubt if the film ever looked this good in the theaters.  The soundstage is broader and more detailed than ever and voices are crystal in their clarity.  The second disc of special features is icing on the cake.  This disc is very highly recommended and a must own!

But for a while there was talk of John Wayne getting the role of Patton.  Seriously, can you imagine that?  It makes me shudder.  ""I want you buckeroos to know that no pilgrim ever won a war by dying for his country.  You better believe it or you're dead where you stand, son.""  God help us.  Fortunately, saner heads prevailed.  Fortunately, studio executives actually decided to go with the one script (six were written) that was closest to the truth and didn't glorify or exaggerate.  Fortunately, George C. Scott existed to play the part.  Who else could have been Patton?  I don't think there was or is another actor.  He was born for the role.What makes this film special is indeed how they stayed so close to the facts, starting with the masterful script, thoroughly researched and written by a young USC grad named Francis Ford Coppola.  Then they combined the great script with great care in how the people, the places, and events looked, down to the smallest details in costuming and set design.  Yes, a few ugly facts are glossed over, such as Patton's anti-semitism (actually not at all uncommon in the military then), but overall this film plays straight and fair with the facts, and you realize how dull history was the way they taught it to us in high school.  The performances are all spot-on, with Malden's Bradley the perfect warm foil for the imperious George S., and Michael Bates a dead ringer for Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery.The transfer to DVD is special, with beautiful color and hardly a nick or scratch.  If you've only seen this one on network TV or old videotapes, you've never really seen Patton before.  The wide-screen presentation allows us to savor the compositions of some really extraordinary shots--all the battle sequences are amazing in how they are staged.  (They used the Spanish army, because they now own all our surplus WWII combat equipment.)Unfortunately, 20th Century Fox did find a way to blow it with this DVD--sort of.  The original issue was a 2-disc set, the second DVD featuring an excellent documentary on the making of the film and the real George S. Patton, with comments by the director, producer, and George C. Scott, and others.  It also has a track of just Jerry Goldsmith's wonderful score (beautifully restored in the film, btw).  My only complaint was the documentary was not long enough--a subject as fascinating as Patton, and the making of Patton, deserves two hours, not one.  Now Fox has taken the two-disc Patton out of circulation and replaced it with this version from the ""Fox War Series""--only one disc, and for not many dollars less than the original double-set.  I'd advise anyone who really care about this movie and loves DVD extras to cruise eBay for copies of the 2DVD Patton, as they do pop up frequently.  That's the best way to own this film.  The single-disc is a poor substitute.",5,Likely the best Hollywood war film ever made,1014076800,"02 19, 2002",2002,2989,"['do', ""n't"", 'mean', 'Hollywood', 'insult', 'glossy', 'Hollywood', 'big', 'budget', 'epic', 'not', 'inherently', 'bad', 'while', 'there', 'was', 'talk', 'John', 'Wayne', 'getting', 'role', 'Patton', 'Seriously', 'can', 'imagine', 'shudder', 'want', 'buckeroos', 'know', 'pilgrim', 'ever', 'won', 'war', 'dying', 'country', 'better', 'believe', ""'re"", 'dead', 'where', 'stand', 'son', 'God', 'help', 'Fortunately', 'saner', 'heads', 'prevailed', 'Fortunately', 'studio', 'executives', 'actually', 'decided', 'go', 'one', 'script', 'six', 'were', 'written', 'was', 'closest', 'truth', 'did', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'exaggerate', 'Fortunately', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'existed', 'play', 'part', 'Who', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'Patton', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'actor', 'was', 'born', 'role.What', 'film', 'special', 'indeed', 'how', 'stayed', 'so', 'close', 'facts', 'starting', 'masterful', 'script', 'thoroughly', 'researched', 'written', 'young', 'USC', 'grad', 'named', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Then', 'combined', 'great', 'script', 'great', 'care', 'how', 'people', 'places', 'events', 'looked', 'down', 'smallest', 'details', 'costuming', 'set', 'design', 'Yes', 'few', 'ugly', 'facts', 'are', 'glossed', 'such', 'Patton', 'anti-semitism', 'actually', 'not', 'uncommon', 'military', 'then', 'film', 'straight', 'fair', 'facts', 'realize', 'how', 'dull', 'history', 'was', 'way', 'taught', 'high', 'school', 'performances', 'are', 'spot-on', 'Malden', 'Bradley', 'perfect', 'warm', 'foil', 'imperious', 'George', 'S.', 'Michael', 'Bates', 'dead', 'ringer', 'Field', 'Marshal', 'Bernard', 'Montgomery.The', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'special', 'beautiful', 'color', 'hardly', 'nick', 'scratch', ""'ve"", 'only', 'seen', 'one', 'network', 'TV', 'old', 'videotapes', ""'ve"", 'never', 'really', 'seen', 'Patton', 'wide-screen', 'presentation', 'savor', 'compositions', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'shots', 'battle', 'sequences', 'are', 'amazing', 'how', 'are', 'staged', 'used', 'Spanish', 'army', 'now', 'own', 'surplus', 'WWII', 'combat', 'equipment', 'Unfortunately', '20th', 'Century', 'Fox', 'did', 'find', 'way', 'blow', 'DVD', 'sort', 'original', 'issue', 'was', '2-disc', 'set', 'second', 'DVD', 'featuring', 'excellent', 'documentary', 'making', 'film', 'real', 'George', 'S.', 'Patton', 'comments', 'director', 'producer', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'others', 'also', 'track', 'just', 'Jerry', 'Goldsmith', 'wonderful', 'score', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'film', 'btw', 'only', 'complaint', 'was', 'documentary', 'was', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'subject', 'as', 'fascinating', 'Patton', 'making', 'Patton', 'two', 'hours', 'not', 'one', 'Now', 'Fox', 'taken', 'two-disc', 'Patton', 'circulation', 'replaced', 'version', 'Fox', 'War', 'Series', 'only', 'one', 'disc', 'not', 'many', 'dollars', 'less', 'original', 'double-set', ""'d"", 'advise', 'anyone', 'who', 'really', 'care', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'cruise', 'eBay', 'copies', '2DVD', 'Patton', 'do', 'pop', 'up', 'frequently', 'best', 'way', 'own', 'film', 'single-disc', 'poor', 'substitute']",N/A
440310,A26ZMEMGD5BCUQ,6304935811,the Matt from Oz,"[49, 61]","I have to agree with the very few that have called Fox on its despicable job with the picture quality on Patton.I give the film four stars  (in case you were thinking i'm just being mean and unhelpful) and the Blu-ray one. In case you didn't red those others (and there should be MANY more critical reviews of this movie's quality), here it is in a nutshell.You've been duped.Oh no it isn't great picture quality. The remaster is AWFUL.Have you heard of DNR, or Digital Noise Reduction? Film has grain. 70mm film has less noticeable grain due to its large negative size. The thing is, picture detail cannot be separated from the grain and the chemical reaction when the film is exposed.Because people want to see things looking 'clear' and 'high-def' like HD video and digitally originated cg/3d movies, the studios are 'scrubbing' the pictures electronically to get rid of the grain. They also use a technique called 'edge enhancement' to artificially sharpen the picture by increasing areas of high contrast like edges. So what you get is a halo effect around the edges, and/or LOSS of fine details because when you erase the grain, you erase the high-frequency detail. Detail on chemical film is inseparable. Look at Karl Malden - where are the pores of his skin? HD, and certainly the original 70mm film, is capable of showing this. Now go and look at Patton again. Just atrocious. You've been robbed and don't even know it. Compare it to another 'war' movie, Blackhawk down. THAT's detail and picture quality. Yes Patton is older, but it was shot on 70mm and there should be plenty of detail so you can actually compare the two differently aged films.Look at Jennifer Connelly's face in Hulk where you can see pores and fine hair, peachfuzz and so on. Then look at something like the Dark City BD, where it's been erased (even though she's younger there!). In Sweeney Todd, the worst thing is they only applied the DNR around the nose and cheeks/under the eyes. See how 'blurred' it looks! They didn't even put grain back over the top to match the rest of the picture - and the most ridiculous thing of all is that in Sweeney Todd Depp and Carter are SUPPOSED to look drawn and tired and lined! It's just ludicrous! And they DON'T do it to other characters! Look at Depp's face in the Pirates movies. THAT'S what you should be seeing, colour grading and tone aside.I won't even start on how many filmmakers use coarser grain to make the tone/film literally more 'gritty'. On purpose.DNR is the devil, to be melodramatic about it. I'm not buying Patton on BD until they 'fess up and 'unfix' the thing. HD and Blu-ray are supposed to let you see a film as ACCURATELY to the original as possible.

440319,A1NTXJPTFP1G03,6304935811,"Van T. Roberts ""Film Historian""","[8, 9]","Few Hollywood biographies capture the ambiguities of the person it portrays, but ""Planet of the Apes"" director Franklin J. Schaffner's biography of General George S. Patton proved the exception to the rule. ""Patton"" received seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Art & Set Direction, and garnered nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, and Best Original Music. Repeated screenings of this extraordinary World War II epic combat film, especially George C. Scott's bravura performance, make it difficult to believe that producer Frank McCarthy toiled for 19 years to persuade the Pentagon as well as General Patton's family, both adamantly opposed to it, to help him produce this multi-faceted film.Scenarist Francis Ford Coppola, long before he made his own masterpiece ""Apocalypse Now,"" penned one of the earliest versions of the ""Patton"" script and realized the deadly pitfalls that lay in the subject matter for any filmmaker. ""Wait a minute, this guy was obviously nuts. If they want to make a film glorifying him as a great American hero, it will be laughed at. And if I write a film that condemns him, it won't be made at all."" Coppola encapsulated the contradictions that confronted McCarthy for nearly twenty years. According to Coppola, only George C. Scott's intervention brought Coppola's long since rejected elements back into the film, particularly the stunning opening with Scott poised in from a gigantic American flag delivering his stirring speech to the troops.Initially, the Patton family opposed ""Patton,"" and McCarthy recalled the rage of Colonel George S. Patton III who threatened shoot anybody who made a movie about his father. Indeed, Twentieth Century Fox shelved ""Patton"" in 1951 and Warner Brothers following in their footsteps in 1953 not only because the family did not trust the filmmakers, but also because the Pentagon felt any film about Patton would portray the Army in an offensive manner, particularly because the general emerged as such a controversial figure. The family interpreted any movie as an invasion of privacy, lobbied the Pentagon to deny cooperation to filmmakers, and even launched a law suit.Eventually, the Defense Department cooperated, but it provided none of the equipment that appeared in the film. The Spanish Army furnished the tanks, equipment, and troops for the battle sequences. Patton's daughter Ruth Ellen Totten dropped the law suit after she saw Schaffner's film. Reportedly, Totten told her attorneys, ""Call off the dogs."" She gushed about it. ""I think that it is the best movie I have ever seen since Gone with the Wind."" Totten added brother George was thrilled by Scott's portrayal.The positive reception of ""Patton"" seems almost inevitable in light of the authenticity of Schaffner's film. McCarthy scored a coup when he convinced General of the Army Omar N. Bradley to serve as 'senior military adviser. Bradley scrutinized the script and later took McCarthy and Schaffner on a tour of the battlefields in Belgium, France, and Tunisia, so Schaffner was confident that ""we didn't do anything which was outrageous or silly."" However, McCarthy had to purchase Bradley's memoirs to obtain his services. Inevitably, ""Patton"" compared its insane, quixotic hero with Bradley's more down-to-earth, humanitarian general. Four-star General Paul Harkins, who had been Patton's chief of staff, joined Bradley as another military adviser. These two figures placated the earliest anxieties that the Patton family had about the production.Clocking in at walloping 169 minutes, ""Patton"" depicted the celebrated general as an amalgamation of contradictions. He was religious but profane. He was violent but sentimental. George C. Scott perused Patton books and watched news reel films. Indeed, Scott transformed his appearance to resemble the general. Totten called Scott's portrayal ""tour de force."" Winning the acceptance of the Patton family and the military proved one part. Twentieth Century Fox had to win over moviegoers during the era of the Vietnam War with most people agreed that the nation has lost the war. Co-scenarist Edmund North summarized what attracted audiences divided over Vietnam to ""Patton"": ""I believe it was because each person brought to it his own underlying feelings about the Vietnam war.""Those who were appalled by Vietnam interpreted ""Patton"" a fascinating anti-hero. Those--like Richard Nixon--who regarded Vietnam as a noble enterprise could find comfort and support in Patton's self-righteous and dedicated savagery."" President Nixon watched ""Patton"" twice and admired the general's arch-authoritarian attitude. Later, Nixon denied in an interview with David Frost in 1977 that the film ""Patton"" had inspired him to launch his Cambodian invasion Cambodia five days after watching Patton the second time. The film has many memorable moments, especially Patton's orders to a chaplain to intervene with God with a prayer for good weather and the scene in the desert when Patton leaps out of a window to fire on a German aircraft.

The remaster (which features George C. Scott against the background of an American flag full face vs. the previous Blu master which had a white background with only half of Scott's face visible--the digibook edition is also the older master as is the edition in this packagePatton / Longest Day / Sand Pebbles / Tora Tora [Blu-ray])looks marvelous--the film grain looks natural and grain is consistent from scene to scene. Fine detail is much improved especially skin textures although keep in mind this will never look quite as sharp or as detailed as a current film, it looks darn good for its age. Fox did a exceptional job on remastering this and made sure to only use minimal edge enchacement and digital noise reduction tastefully.War is hell. More importantly, war is hell for those whose very lives are defined by it. The late George C. Scott brings Patton to life in a way that few actors could have. A West Point graduate who believed he was the reincarnation of Alexander The Great, Patton focuses on the character of the man and his obsessive rivalry with ""Monty"" his British counterpart. Patton comes across as a gunslinger in modern warfare believing that the code of conduct for a soldier in battle should be respected regardless of which side you're on and, of course, his side should always be the winning side.Francis Ford Coppola co-wrote the perceptive screenplay (and shared an Oscar for it although he never worked with is co-writer the late Edmund H. North. The two wrote separate drafts one of which incorporated information from the memoir of General Omar Bradley)and the talented late director Franklin J. Schaffner (""Planet of the Apes"", ""The Warlord"")fashioned his directorial masterpiece from the material he had at hand. Brilliantly filmed with sharp, powerful support performances (particularly from the talented Karl Malden), ""Patton"" remains one of the best films about an individual involved in a massive war and what drove him to try and be the best.The special features are largely confined to the second disc a standard DVD (although we do get an entertaining commentary track from Coppola who notes throughout material that he wrote vs. North and how they compliment each other in the final version). We also get an interesting and lively introduction by Coppola on the first disc as well.The second disc includes an excellent documentary ""The Making of 'Patton'"" from 1997. We also get ""Patton's Ghost Corps"" which covers Patton's campagins. The Ken Burns 2000 documentary ""History Through The Lens: Patton-The Rebel Revisited"" is an exceptional overview of the man and the mythology that surrounded him both when he was alive and after death.

George  Patton.What endeared Gen. Patton to his troops was his willingless to  expose himself to the line of enemy fire, unlike other &quot;office  generals&quot;. That he pushed his troops almost beyond the limit of human  endurance is without question. But that could be excused by his belief that  aggressiveness in the battlefield saves more human lives in the long run  and hastens the end of the war.George Scott's portrayal of Gen. Patton  was of monumental proportion, it was an actor in his element. From the  general's gentle side and diplomatic tact when he was in his best behavior  to his thunderous, manic explosion when he was at the height of his fury,  Scott got it all! No one could have done a better job portraying the  unpredictable, egoistical, brilliant general.The realistic recreation of  battle scenes and the accurate depiction of war characters, like Gen. Omar  Bradley and others, make this film a must for historians and history buffs  alike, and put this film in the list of best war movies ever made.The  only irony of it all is, Gen.

Noshie,"[3, 3]","I am not usually a very big fan of old movies due to the quality of the filming, sound, etc; however In This movie you will see Patton, the man & his achievements.  An excellent description of his character, his tactics and his attitude with his men. A very strong character well worthy of his legend. A great history movie full of action which age very well with years; and unlike other old movies, the photography as well as the DVD sound and picture are very good. A great DVD to own. Highly recommended.",5,Patton the legend,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,507,"['am', 'not', 'usually', 'very', 'big', 'fan', 'old', 'movies', 'due', 'quality', 'filming', 'sound', 'etc', 'however', 'movie', 'will', 'see', 'Patton', 'man', 'achievements', 'excellent', 'description', 'character', 'tactics', 'attitude', 'men', 'very', 'strong', 'character', 'well', 'worthy', 'legend', 'great', 'history', 'movie', 'full', 'action', 'age', 'very', 'well', 'years', 'other', 'old', 'movies', 'photography', 'as', 'well', 'DVD', 'sound', 'picture', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'great', 'DVD', 'own', 'Highly', 'recommended']",N/A
