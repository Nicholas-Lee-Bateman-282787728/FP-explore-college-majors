952737,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000BYA5G4,A Customer,"[1, 5]","Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a young second generation Ukrainian living in New York's Little Odessa. Life is tough for Yuri; frustrated and poor, he realizes that he's not really that good at anything, with the world pretty much offering him a ticket to know where. When we first meet him, around 1982, he is longing to bust out of the kosher restaurant owned by his father, who fervently keeps up the charade of being Jewish that he invented so he could get his family expelled from the Soviet Union.I guess when you're raised on a lie; it becomes pretty easy to keep the pretense up. Yuri, recognizing he has a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, hatches a plan with his kid-brother Vitali (Jared Leto) to sell arms and ammunitions: ""that was the day I realized my destiny lay in fulfilling another basic human need."" Of course, there isn't much business for this kind of thing in the States, so Yuri and Vitali find themselves doing business in Berlin during the height of the Cold War.Their criminal trade eventually takes them to South America, where Vitali gets hooked on coke, and where, for the first time, they meet their arch nemesis Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an idealistic Interpol agent.  But the bulk of Yuri's fortune is made when the Soviet Union crumbles and its vast cache of weapons is made available to him.Now Yuri is free to sell his product to war torn Africa, where he becomes professionally entangled with Liberian president Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), a kind of Charles Taylor-like fanatical dictator. Along the way Yuri becomes a very rich man adopting a glamorous supermodel trophy wife Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and tries to help his brother Vitali beat his steady addiction to cocaine and alcohol.Director Andrew Nichol's movie is unapologetically purposeful, and his subject matter is incendiary and also quite timely. The devastating consequences of the weapons trade are well known, and Lord of War is a forceful film with a lot on its mind. Then why is the film so flat and un-involving? Perhaps because it's all so convoluted - Nichol probably has enough material here for five movies, consequently his narrative never complete meshes; it's as though Lord of War is a film in search of a decent plot.It doesn't help that Yuri is played by Cage, one of the most over-rated actors of his generation, doing his usual softly spoken, puppy dog shtick; he blusters when he should be quiet and raves when he should be contemplative. When the dialogue isn't enough to provide the facts, Nichol stuffs Yuri's mouth with cynical, and contemptuous narration to describe the dirty business in detail, but you really have to worry about a film when Yuri's verbal announcements are far more intriguing than the fictional plot devices used to provide human drama.I guess you could say that Lord of War is mildly intriguing when it deals with the nuts and bolts of the weapons business, and it often sails along with a nifty, amoral irreverence. But it's just too overly didactic and preachy, ultimately sinking under the weight of it's own message and pretensions. What really does this film in is the director's penchant for turning Yuri into a character that we should care about.There are a few cheeky moments complete with some funny lines, but after forty minutes or so, it all becomes terribly repetitive. After all, we've got the message in the opening credits, which follow the life of a bullet from the factory to the forehead of a third-world teenager.

952738,A34VV92TSLC37R,B000BYA5G4,Adam Craig,"[1, 1]","Lord of War follows the exploits of Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian immigrant to America in the early 1980s.  Yuri decides to get into the gun-running business when he sees an attempted assassination of a ganglord one day in his hometown.  The movie follows Yuri's story over the course of 20 years.  All the highs and lows of the business, and the consequences of his actions.This movie is definitely not an action adventure.  It really is more of a satire; a serious, violent satire, but still a satire.  Somehow, the movie allows, even encourages us, to root for Nicolas Cage's ruthless, exploitative character.  Yuri is a good, deep character, who is aware of his flaws, but he is also aware that gun-running is the one thing he is good at, and he is not so willing to give it up.  Nicolas Cage is obviously a talented actor, and he does a good job here, but nothing that he hasn't done the basics of before.  Jared Leto, who plays Yuri's brother, Vitoli, does an admirable job of playing a distressed, drugged-out, morally aware sidekick to his brother's illegalities.  The best character of the movie, though, is agent Jack Valentine, played by Ethan Hawke.  Valentine appears sparingly, but the scenes that he and Cage share are the best of the movie.  The verbal sparring between the characters is extremely well-written, and has a deep meaning that runs underneath the entire film.Don't watch this movie expecting nonstop action and explosions, watch it for the ideas that it expands on, and the moral dilemmas it exposes.  The film asks many questions, and the answers are complicated.  But one thing is for sure: I enjoyed watching the questions get asked.",4,"An intelligent, sometimes humorous film",1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,1658,"['Lord', 'War', 'exploits', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Ukranian', 'immigrant', 'America', 'early', '1980s', 'Yuri', 'get', 'gun-running', 'business', 'when', 'attempted', 'assassination', 'ganglord', 'one', 'day', 'hometown', 'movie', 'Yuri', 'story', 'course', '20', 'years', 'highs', 'lows', 'business', 'consequences', 'actions.This', 'movie', 'definitely', 'not', 'action', 'adventure', 'really', 'more', 'satire', 'serious', 'violent', 'satire', 'still', 'satire', 'Somehow', 'movie', 'even', 'root', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'ruthless', 'exploitative', 'character', 'Yuri', 'good', 'deep', 'character', 'who', 'aware', 'flaws', 'also', 'aware', 'gun-running', 'one', 'thing', 'good', 'not', 'so', 'willing', 'give', 'up', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'obviously', 'talented', 'actor', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'done', 'basics', 'before', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'who', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'Vitoli', 'admirable', 'job', 'playing', 'distressed', 'drugged-out', 'morally', 'aware', 'sidekick', 'brother', 'illegalities', 'best', 'character', 'movie', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Valentine', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Valentine', 'sparingly', 'scenes', 'Cage', 'share', 'are', 'best', 'movie', 'verbal', 'sparring', 'characters', 'extremely', 'well-written', 'deep', 'meaning', 'entire', 'film.Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'movie', 'expecting', 'nonstop', 'action', 'explosions', 'watch', 'ideas', 'moral', 'dilemmas', 'film', 'many', 'questions', 'answers', 'are', 'complicated', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'questions', 'get', 'asked']",N/A
952739,ADLVFFE4VBT8,B000BYA5G4,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[0, 0]","What's the difference between, let's say a 'country' sending military 'aid' to other governments that oppress their own people and sometimes attack, invade or occupy their neighbors and private arm dealers buying (usually small) arms from wherever they can and selling them for a profit to whomever can afford them? There are differences of scale. As Yuri Orlov notes toward the end of the movie, right before the credits begin to roll, the president of the United States sells more weapons in one day than he (Yuri) does in a full year. Then there's the issue of legality. Since it's the governments who decide what's legal and what's not, small fish like Orlov are known as 'gun runners' and they are to be viewed as evil or irresponsible. Unlike governments who usually 'spread freedom', provide 'aid' or help the nicer dictators, autocrats and internationally recognized oppressors fight 'extremism' or 'anarchy'. Unless the governments want to 'help' certain extremely vile states or 'movements', in which case they covertly use the little gun runners to funnel their support. 'Lord of War' ends with an interesting observation - nothing new or unexpected, a fact known to most of us but, somehow, hidden almost out of existence someplace rarely visited inside our mind: world's largest arms dealers are the 5, armed to the teeth,  permanent members of the Security Council: the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, China.'Lord of War' is the story of Yuri Orlov, a small fish, private gun runner who makes a living for himself and his family by doing, illegally, a little bit of what legitimate governments do officially. People die while Yuri, most convincingly portrayed by Nicolas Cage, gets rich. And, while they are killing each other, it's worth noting that some of the weapons used by one side or sometimes both sides were provided by Yuri, often at great personal risk. Being small and a private individual, Yuri is constantly chased and harassed by agent Valentine of the Interpol and his life is a constant, dangerous and risky struggle of surviving his business dealings usually involving bloody dictators or drug dealers, keeping his marriage from falling apart and keeping Vitaly, his kid brother, from completely destroying himself by means of mass quantities of drugs consumption.Nicolas Cage acting is superb and so is Jared Leto's as Vitaly Orlov, Yuri's brother. All others are playing their parts well but this is mainly the story of Yuri and both the part and the actor easily eclipse the rest into 'supporting' parts. Besides Cage's acting, the effort to provide authenticity is remarkable - 100 tanks that Yuri is about to buy were real, not props, and they were indeed for sale and so are some of the behaviors attributed to some of the characters such as the Liberian president.'Lord of War' is a commendable effort at providing an inside view into the world of weapons commerce but, in the end, it misses the mark and even the movie's makers seem to be aware of it. Yes, it's true that private arms dealers sell arms but it's also true that their contribution to global mayhem is small to insignificant when compared to what the real market leaders, the world's big 'powers' can provide. It just may be that the problem is not that, as Yuri observes, one in twelve people owns a gun but that eleven out of twelve don't and they are often at the mercy of those who do. Far from being a lord of war, Yuri's character fulfills a need and, human nature being what it is, it's quite likely that someone else would step in the moment Yuri turned pacifist and, as history teaches us, people are quite capable of killing each other by the millions, with or without fire arms. Watching 'Lord of War' was not time wasted. The movie does have its moments but the impression it leaves is that... maybe movie makers wished they aimed a little higher or closer to the root causes of state instigated or state inflicted violence.-->> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;",4,"The truth is in there, but not in plain view",1271808000,"04 21, 2010",2010,3999,"['What', 'difference', 'let', 'say', ""'country"", 'sending', 'military', ""'aid"", 'other', 'governments', 'oppress', 'own', 'people', 'sometimes', 'attack', 'invade', 'occupy', 'neighbors', 'private', 'arm', 'dealers', 'buying', 'usually', 'small', 'arms', 'can', 'selling', 'profit', 'whomever', 'can', 'afford', 'are', 'differences', 'scale', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'end', 'movie', 'right', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll', 'president', 'United', 'States', 'more', 'weapons', 'one', 'day', 'full', 'year', 'Then', 'issue', 'legality', 'governments', 'who', 'decide', 'what', 'legal', 'what', 'not', 'small', 'fish', 'Orlov', 'are', 'known', ""'gun"", 'runners', 'are', 'be', 'viewed', 'evil', 'irresponsible', 'governments', 'who', 'usually', ""'spread"", 'freedom', 'provide', ""'aid"", 'help', 'nicer', 'dictators', 'autocrats', 'internationally', 'recognized', 'oppressors', 'fight', ""'extremism"", 'governments', 'want', ""'help"", 'certain', 'extremely', 'vile', 'states', ""'movements"", 'case', 'covertly', 'use', 'little', 'gun', 'runners', 'funnel', 'support', ""'Lord"", 'War', 'ends', 'interesting', 'observation', 'nothing', 'new', 'unexpected', 'fact', 'known', 'most', 'somehow', 'almost', 'existence', 'someplace', 'rarely', 'visited', 'mind', 'world', 'largest', 'arms', 'dealers', 'are', '5', 'armed', 'teeth', 'permanent', 'members', 'Security', 'Council', 'United', 'States', 'Russia', 'France', 'Great', 'Britain', 'China', ""'Lord"", 'War', 'story', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'small', 'fish', 'private', 'gun', 'runner', 'who', 'living', 'family', 'doing', 'illegally', 'little', 'bit', 'what', 'legitimate', 'governments', 'do', 'officially', 'People', 'die', 'Yuri', 'most', 'convincingly', 'portrayed', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'rich', 'are', 'killing', 'other', 'worth', 'noting', 'weapons', 'used', 'one', 'side', 'sometimes', 'sides', 'were', 'provided', 'Yuri', 'often', 'great', 'personal', 'risk', 'Being', 'small', 'private', 'individual', 'Yuri', 'constantly', 'chased', 'harassed', 'agent', 'Valentine', 'Interpol', 'life', 'constant', 'dangerous', 'risky', 'struggle', 'surviving', 'business', 'dealings', 'usually', 'involving', 'bloody', 'dictators', 'drug', 'dealers', 'keeping', 'marriage', 'falling', 'apart', 'keeping', 'Vitaly', 'kid', 'brother', 'completely', 'destroying', 'means', 'mass', 'quantities', 'drugs', 'consumption.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'acting', 'superb', 'so', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Vitaly', 'Orlov', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'others', 'are', 'playing', 'parts', 'well', 'mainly', 'story', 'Yuri', 'part', 'actor', 'easily', 'rest', ""'supporting"", 'parts', 'Besides', 'Cage', 'acting', 'effort', 'provide', 'authenticity', 'remarkable', '100', 'tanks', 'Yuri', 'buy', 'were', 'real', 'not', 'props', 'were', 'indeed', 'sale', 'so', 'are', 'behaviors', 'attributed', 'characters', 'such', 'Liberian', 'president', ""'Lord"", 'War', 'commendable', 'effort', 'providing', 'inside', 'view', 'world', 'weapons', 'commerce', 'end', 'mark', 'even', 'movie', 'makers', 'seem', 'be', 'aware', 'Yes', 'true', 'private', 'arms', 'dealers', 'sell', 'arms', 'also', 'true', 'contribution', 'global', 'mayhem', 'small', 'insignificant', 'when', 'compared', 'what', 'real', 'market', 'leaders', 'world', 'big', ""'powers"", 'can', 'provide', 'just', 'may', 'be', 'problem', 'not', 'that', 'Yuri', 'one', 'twelve', 'people', 'gun', 'twelve', 'do', ""n't"", 'are', 'often', 'mercy', 'who', 'do', 'Far', 'being', 'lord', 'war', 'Yuri', 'character', 'need', 'human', 'nature', 'being', 'what', 'quite', 'likely', 'someone', 'else', 'would', 'step', 'moment', 'Yuri', 'turned', 'pacifist', 'history', 'teaches', 'people', 'are', 'quite', 'capable', 'killing', 'other', 'millions', 'fire', 'arms', 'Watching', ""'Lord"", 'War', 'was', 'not', 'time', 'wasted', 'movie', 'have', 'moments', 'impression', 'maybe', 'movie', 'makers', 'wished', 'aimed', 'little', 'higher', 'closer', 'root', 'causes', 'state', 'instigated', 'state', 'inflicted', 'violence.', '>', '>', 'Brush', 'teeth', 'law', 'lt', 'lt']",N/A

952741,A2TVAG2XX0LWIO,B000BYA5G4,A. Fierro,"[3, 5]","I like Nicholas Cage movies, although the Weatherman is not what I would classify as a movie, more like a huge train wreck, were bodies and all were caught on film and then labeled as the Weatherman.  More or less, most his Nick Cage's movies are pretty good.  He is a good overall actor and is one of the few men that can handle the lead role in a movie and be basically the sole good character in an entire production such as I felt was the case in 8mm.I wanted to see Lord of War when it came out in the theaters, but since I never got that chance I had to wait until it came out on DVD and lets just say that I'm glad that I waited and didn't pay 8 bucks, and instead rented it for $3.99 at Blockbuster.  Not to say that Lord of War is a bad movie, because it isn't, but what I think really hinders most of Cage's movies is that they are one-dimensional.  The development of the storyline of LOW is good and pretty basic.  And action scenes are decent, but what really gets me about this film is that it jumps around from one story line to the next.At one point in the movie Cage's character is selling his first machine gun in the bedroom of a hotel, the gentlemen buying the gun from Cage takes the gun out of the case and holds it to Cage's head, as if we to display that is a very dangerous business to be in.  I think that is a given, considering that it is illegal arms dealing and every body that are going to encounter in this business is breaking the law of every country throughout the world that has a legit government.  The next thing you know Cage is at a worldwide conference of arms, and arm smuggling.  What struck me is how he went from small time, one gun at a time dealer to rubbing arms with the big wheels of the business just like that.  I would have liked a little bit more detail of how you become the Lord of War.Of course, just like in any business contacts are the most important aspect and that is defiantly true it the arm running business as this movie plainly shows.  But I believe that there is not enough detail in the movie of how the relationships are started, maintained and carried out in a business, which could land you years behind bars throughout most of the world.  Cage is simply too cool throughout the movie in a business that probably gets a lot of people killed each year.  And to me that coolness factor played well in a movie like Matchstick Men, when the stakes were relatively low(a few million dollars) versus this movie where he played the middleman by selling weapons that killed thousands of people in many countries throughout the world.  To me, this movie needed a leading man more like out of the Harrison Ford type, rigid, rough, strong and could be a totally nice guy that would blow your brains out if he needed to.  The type of guy that you could trust if you were going to make a deal with him, but that you would not mind taking out because he was a totally jerk and you didn't care for him in the first place.LOW is a three and half star movie that could have had better story development, character development and perhaps could have been rolled into two movies considering that the subject of the movie is a large one.  But then again, how many other movies are about American men of Russian decent selling gun on a worldwide level?  Not many, and that is why I think a better job could have been done making this one.",3,"Not a must-see, but a decent, almost one of kind movie",1161043200,"10 17, 2006",2006,3389,"['like', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'movies', 'Weatherman', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'classify', 'movie', 'more', 'huge', 'train', 'wreck', 'were', 'bodies', 'were', 'caught', 'film', 'then', 'labeled', 'Weatherman', 'More', 'less', 'most', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'movies', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'good', 'overall', 'actor', 'one', 'few', 'men', 'can', 'handle', 'lead', 'role', 'movie', 'be', 'basically', 'sole', 'good', 'character', 'entire', 'production', 'such', 'felt', 'was', 'case', '8mm.I', 'wanted', 'see', 'Lord', 'War', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'never', 'got', 'chance', 'had', 'wait', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'just', 'say', ""'m"", 'glad', 'waited', 'did', ""n't"", 'pay', '8', 'bucks', 'instead', 'rented', '3.99', 'Blockbuster', 'Not', 'say', 'Lord', 'War', 'bad', 'movie', ""n't"", 'what', 'think', 'really', 'hinders', 'most', 'Cage', 'movies', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'development', 'storyline', 'LOW', 'good', 'pretty', 'basic', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'decent', 'what', 'really', 'film', 'one', 'story', 'line', 'next.At', 'one', 'point', 'movie', 'Cage', 'character', 'selling', 'first', 'machine', 'gun', 'bedroom', 'hotel', 'gentlemen', 'buying', 'gun', 'Cage', 'gun', 'case', 'Cage', 'head', 'display', 'very', 'dangerous', 'business', 'be', 'think', 'given', 'considering', 'illegal', 'arms', 'dealing', 'body', 'are', 'going', 'encounter', 'business', 'breaking', 'law', 'country', 'world', 'legit', 'government', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'Cage', 'worldwide', 'conference', 'arms', 'arm', 'smuggling', 'What', 'struck', 'how', 'went', 'small', 'time', 'one', 'gun', 'time', 'dealer', 'rubbing', 'arms', 'big', 'wheels', 'business', 'just', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'little', 'bit', 'more', 'detail', 'how', 'become', 'Lord', 'War.Of', 'course', 'just', 'business', 'contacts', 'are', 'most', 'important', 'aspect', 'defiantly', 'true', 'arm', 'running', 'business', 'movie', 'plainly', 'believe', 'not', 'enough', 'detail', 'movie', 'how', 'relationships', 'are', 'started', 'maintained', 'carried', 'out', 'business', 'could', 'land', 'years', 'bars', 'most', 'world', 'Cage', 'simply', 'too', 'cool', 'movie', 'business', 'probably', 'lot', 'people', 'killed', 'year', 'coolness', 'factor', 'played', 'well', 'movie', 'Matchstick', 'Men', 'when', 'stakes', 'were', 'relatively', 'low', 'few', 'million', 'dollars', 'versus', 'movie', 'where', 'played', 'middleman', 'selling', 'weapons', 'killed', 'thousands', 'people', 'many', 'countries', 'world', 'movie', 'needed', 'leading', 'man', 'more', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'type', 'rigid', 'rough', 'strong', 'could', 'be', 'totally', 'nice', 'guy', 'would', 'blow', 'brains', 'out', 'needed', 'type', 'guy', 'could', 'trust', 'were', 'going', 'make', 'deal', 'would', 'not', 'mind', 'taking', 'out', 'was', 'totally', 'jerk', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'first', 'place.LOW', 'three', 'half', 'star', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'better', 'story', 'development', 'character', 'development', 'perhaps', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'rolled', 'two', 'movies', 'considering', 'subject', 'movie', 'large', 'one', 'then', 'again', 'how', 'many', 'other', 'movies', 'are', 'American', 'men', 'Russian', 'decent', 'selling', 'gun', 'worldwide', 'level', 'Not', 'many', 'why', 'think', 'better', 'job', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'making', 'one']",N/A

952744,A52X1I4UT56KL,B000BYA5G4,"Amazon Customer ""debater7""","[4, 5]","There are a lot of critical reviews regarding the fact that the movie isn't as funny as some would like, or because ""the message"" isn't exactly what they want it to be.  But, this is a great movie.  As a story, it does a good job of dragging the viewer into the protagonist's head.  The shocking thing, that many reviewers don't like, is that Ury is kinda nuts.  He just doesn't ""get"" other people, probably because he doesn't care about them like a normal person.  This guy's passion is the rush he gets from trading arms.  Although, there is a lot of ambiguity about exactly what Ury's thinking.  That's part of story.  Just how far gone is this guy?Basically, this is a solid movie about an upleasant topic with a plot twist at the end.  Very graphic, fair amount of action, good script, strong acting in the important roles, and some very dark humor.  If you have a very dark sense of humor or are looking for a hard-hitting drama, this film is excellent.The plot itself is straightforward (guy becomes int'l arms dealer and faces unique career and family issues along the way), but the ending will be surprising to most people.  Although well foreshadowed, it is also well-concealed.  It's one of those things that will make you re-think a ton of what came before, like ""Fight Club.""  I don't understand why some reviewers think the portrayal is so innaccurate.  Ury had lots of help, but the structure of his organization isn't so important.  In fact, Ury could have taken a very personal approach to sales, that is a typical feature of the Russian mob and makes them hard to catch.I can see that the movie wasn't as funny as the trailers implied.  It was funny at times, but ultimately the movie is a tragedy.  I suspect that a few of the jokes were so dark that many people just didn't find them humorous.  For example, there is a scene where a customer shoots a guy for no apparent reason.  I thought it was a funny scene, you had to know it would happen at some point, and Ury's reaction was just too perfect.  A girl I watched the movie with, on the other, screamed in shock.  ""Lord of War"" is funny in the same way that ""Truman Show"" was funny or the same way that Hamlet chatting up a skull can be funny.  If that isn't funny to you, this won't be either.  The trailers did make clear that ""Lord"" wasn't funny in a traditional sense and it just isn't.Actually, I wouldn't recommend ""Lord of War"" to anyone who isn't up for some gruesomeness.  There are scenes as graphic as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but the victims are rarely soldiers, some are kids.  The violence is important to the message and isn't as bad as it could be, but it's ugly.I give it five stars because ""Lord"" has an intensity that so many movies lack these days, portrays the int'l arms market in an interesting way (and fairly accurately), has some great acting, and has just enough humor to keep it from being overbearing.",5,A serious movie about a serious topic.,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,2902,"['are', 'lot', 'critical', 'reviews', 'regarding', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'would', 'like', 'message', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'want', 'be', 'great', 'movie', 'story', 'good', 'job', 'dragging', 'viewer', 'protagonist', 'head', 'shocking', 'thing', 'many', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'Ury', 'kinda', 'nuts', 'just', ""n't"", 'get', 'other', 'people', 'probably', ""n't"", 'care', 'normal', 'person', 'guy', 'passion', 'rush', 'trading', 'arms', 'lot', 'ambiguity', 'exactly', 'what', 'Ury', 'thinking', 'part', 'story', 'Just', 'how', 'far', 'gone', 'guy', 'Basically', 'solid', 'movie', 'upleasant', 'topic', 'plot', 'twist', 'end', 'Very', 'graphic', 'fair', 'amount', 'action', 'good', 'script', 'strong', 'acting', 'important', 'roles', 'very', 'dark', 'humor', 'have', 'very', 'dark', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'looking', 'hard-hitting', 'drama', 'film', 'excellent.The', 'plot', 'straightforward', 'guy', 'int', 'l', 'arms', 'dealer', 'unique', 'career', 'family', 'issues', 'way', 'ending', 'will', 'be', 'surprising', 'most', 'people', 'well', 'foreshadowed', 'also', 'well-concealed', 'one', 'things', 'will', 'make', 're-think', 'ton', 'what', 'came', 'before', 'Fight', 'Club', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'reviewers', 'think', 'portrayal', 'so', 'innaccurate', 'Ury', 'had', 'lots', 'help', 'structure', 'organization', ""n't"", 'so', 'important', 'fact', 'Ury', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'very', 'personal', 'approach', 'sales', 'typical', 'feature', 'Russian', 'mob', 'hard', 'catch.I', 'can', 'see', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'funny', 'trailers', 'implied', 'was', 'funny', 'times', 'ultimately', 'movie', 'tragedy', 'suspect', 'few', 'jokes', 'were', 'so', 'dark', 'many', 'people', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'humorous', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'customer', 'guy', 'apparent', 'reason', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'scene', 'had', 'know', 'would', 'happen', 'point', 'Ury', 'reaction', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'perfect', 'girl', 'watched', 'movie', 'other', 'screamed', 'shock', 'Lord', 'War', 'funny', 'same', 'way', 'Truman', 'Show', 'was', 'funny', 'same', 'way', 'Hamlet', 'chatting', 'up', 'skull', 'can', 'be', 'funny', ""n't"", 'funny', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'either', 'trailers', 'did', 'make', 'clear', 'Lord', 'was', ""n't"", 'funny', 'traditional', 'sense', 'just', ""isn't.Actually"", 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'Lord', 'War', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'up', 'gruesomeness', 'are', 'scenes', 'as', 'graphic', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'victims', 'are', 'rarely', 'soldiers', 'are', 'kids', 'violence', 'important', 'message', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'could', 'be', 'ugly.I', 'give', 'five', 'stars', 'Lord', 'intensity', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'lack', 'days', 'int', 'l', 'arms', 'market', 'interesting', 'way', 'fairly', 'accurately', 'great', 'acting', 'just', 'enough', 'humor', 'keep', 'being', 'overbearing']",N/A

Anyway the movie leaves an uneasy feeling after itself which seemed a bit strange and not usual for a relatively big-budget, major hollywood film. You can't even tell if it has a happy ending or not.""Lord of War"" is totally truthful, maybe some things were slightly exaggerated, but in general I think noone will have doubts that all shown in film is exactly the way it is in real life. Being myself from Russia I can tell all the parts about selling Russian and Ukranian arms are true, after the Soviet Union fell to pieces there were immense amounts of tanks, cannons, different weapons and ammunition stolen and sold nobody knows where to. Well, not only 15 years ago - there are lots of weapons being stolen and sold nowdays in Russia. In every country that's at war (and Russia now is at war with Chechnia) there are many possibilities to earn money selling guns.The only thing that was not truthful in the film is HOW Russia and its people were shown. It just made me laugh, I recalled old American movies of a cold-war period that depicted Russians in a very funny way. Actually noone talks like that and behaves like that. But if you've never been here I think it looks just fine. I've never been to Africa, and African scenes looked fine to me although now I think they might also have some flaws.Generally speaking ""Lord of War"" is about choices we make, and it demonstrates vividly how these choices affect our lives on business and personal level. About acting I have to say Nicolas Cage is doing his usual work, nothing extraordinary, Jared Leto - the same story. But I was blown away by Ethan Hawke - he's totally believable, seems like he's a real interpol agent put on screen.I think it's difficult not to like this movie - it's too serious, thought-provoking and powerful.

952748,A29Y34ALWJUGB5,B000BYA5G4,"Antonio D. Paolucci ""Collector of Entertainment""","[2, 2]","This movie is in many ways a first of its kind, and in many ways it isn't. Lord of War deals with gunrunning, something I've never seen in movies to this scale. For that, I have to give this movie one extra star. But at the same time, this movie has a lot of similarities to Blow, by forcing us to cheer for the bad guy who is doing nothing but contributing to the destruction of the world. Only instead of cocaine, the Lord of War deals in AK-47s.This movie follows the story of Yuri Orlov as he first discovers the profits to be gained in dealing in black-market weapons, and then as he learns the dangers of continuing in the trade. Though surely an intelligent man, he's also one-sighted; all he cares about is how and who to sell his weapons to, or how to gain more weapons at cheap prices. Hell, the day his son first walks is also the day the Cold War officially ends. Do you think he'd be excited about the first steps of his son? Nope, he cares about the massive surplus of Russian weapons left behind because of the ending of the Cold War. Despite all that, he's able to avoid Interpol for years on end, and gets himself involved with one of the most legendary and evil dictators in history, Andre Baptiste.This is a movie of screwed up moral issues. Yuri gets into your head during this movie, and we believe that, though he wants war, he doesn't want death. If he had it his way, he would wish for all the weapons he sold to ""miss"" there target. And he's just such a lovable character. He risks his life daily for what he believes, no matter how off-base those beliefs are, and wants nothing more than to continue supporting his family. He's obviously intelligent. And he's funny, in a morbid sort of way.In the end, though, this is a movie of acquired tastes. If you have no interest in guns (like me), or do not wish to glorify them, then this obviously isn't the movie for you. But if you have a high tolerance for things such as this, then get Lord of War.

952749,ARA48345JZPZR,B000BYA5G4,Archmaker,"[6, 8]","This sharp, incisive, and darkly funny movie about the career of a Ukrainian born American gunrunner was probably too cynical to find acceptance with a general audience.  Its central character is an amoral, conscience-challenged arms dealer who finds it impossible to leave his chosen profession no matter the cost to himself or the people around him because ""he's good at it"".Despite all of Nicholas Cage's inherent charm, this guy is hard to like, especially as the progress of the film will demonstrate his gaining the world and losing his soul and everything else that matters to him.  Films with disturbing protaganists usually don't do well, and judging by a lot of the negative reviews I see here, I think this was a prime example of that response.Most Americans probably don't even recognize or contemplate the fact that our government is the largest arms dealer in the world.  Followed of course, as pointed out in the movie, by all the rest of the UN Security Council (China, France, Great Britain, Russia).You can take the stance that Nic Cage's Yuri does in the film of ""if I don't do it someone else will"" or you can wonder would any of the suffering of, especially, the third world be relieved if arms dealing wasn't so easy, prevalent, and cheap.  Yuri is not sociopathic as many have labeled him in their reviews, he is doggedly amoral.  He takes no sides, he deals to whoever has the cash.  His chief rival admonishes him that he must take sides.  But is that any real option or just more of the same rationale to assauge one's conscience?At any rate, I for one wasn't bored, and I found the writing sharp and insightful and fascinating as it recounts in dispassionate detail the rise of a world class arms dealer.  Extremely well played by Cage, he somehow remains detached from the consequences of his actions for a long while, until all the dark and cynical humor coalesces in the end to a detailing of the harsh tragedy the trade really engenders.The writer/director has created a stylish piece that actually bites into a subject worth thinking about, and takes us into a ruthless and cold world we know little about.

952750,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,B000BYA5G4,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[4, 5]","Andrew Niccol's Lord of War is a very good piece of filmmaking. Niccol takes a serio-comic look at the machinations of the necessary evil that are freelance international arms dealers. This subject has been done before but with disastrous results with the Chevy Chase and Gregory White comedy vehicle, Deal of the Century. Niccol's film is much better due to its subject matter having more resonance in this era of post-Cold War and post-9/11. It also is inherently better due to another fine performance out of Nicholas Cage who has to have cornered the market on deadpan delivery of dialogue that has full comedic timing and at the same time fills a scene with dramatic weight.Lord of War is the story of one Yuri Orlov. A Ukrainian-born American who grows up in what he calls a different type of hell from communist USSR: Brighton Beach, USA. The film encompasses' Yuri's lowly beginnings as an amateur arms dealer selling to the Ukrainian mob enforcers in his neighborhood. Yuri is a quick learner and soon convinces his younger brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) to be his right-hand man. He needs someone to watch his back during his negotiations and sales and sees his brother as the best man for the job. Most of the film is told through as a flashback as Yuri narrates observations he'd made throughout his career as an international arms dealer willing to straddle the line between legal and illegal. In fact, he becomes so good at evading authorities that he soons goes from an amateur being dismissed by the Old Guard arms dealers (one played as an almost conscience to Yuri's amoral ways by Sir Ian Holm)to one who adapts fastest to the new world order of small conflicts that erupts as a consequence to the end of the Cold War. It is during these turbulent times that Yuri develops a business and almost symbiotic relationship with a Liberian warlord named Andres Baptiste, Sr (a chilling and stand out performance by Eamonn Walker) and his even more psychotic son Andres, Jr.We see Yuri from his lowyly beginnings to the height of his power as an elite in the shadowy world of secondary arms dealing. This is even made more pointed when his best customer, warlord Andres Baptiste points out that his people and enemies call him the lord of war, but he believes Yuri deserves that title even more. Yuri is the Lord of War as he sells to both sides in a conflict and tries to justify his amoral business practices by proclaiming that if he didn't sell them the weapons then a dozen others will. Even as he keeps an emotional detachment from the suffering and destruction his practices has wrought worldwide, especially in war-torn West Africa, Yuri's life is complicated even more by the dogged efforts of Interpol agent Jack Valentine (played with boy-scout righteousness by Ethan Hawke) who has made busting Yuri his goal in life. Add Vitaly who has become addicted to cocaine in no small part to his participation in Yuri's business dealings and a trophy wife in Ava Fontaine (played by Bridget Moynahan in a thankless role) all goes to make Yuri's personal and business life another hell he has put himself into.Yuri as a character would've become too much of a caricature if not for the deadpan performance by Nicholas Cage. Cage infuses the character with an almost resigned personality. A permanent ennui at having witnessed atrocities he himself might have caused with his arms dealing, but at the same time know that this is the only thing he's really best at. Cage has lived off playing such characters and even brings back glimpses of a similar but more powerful performance he had in Leaving Las Vegas. Both the character in that film and in Niccol's work have a resigned attitude about how their life has been, but where one gives in to his ennui and becomes suicidal, the Yuri character cannot stop doing what he does even if it meant losing everything he loved and being left disowned and alone.The film is very blunt about the evil that is the international arms trade, but Niccol and his writers have also pointed out that it is an evil that could be stopped if not for the major governments who have used these individuals as a necessary evil to push their strategic and political agenda for the rest of the world. Lord of War doesn't condemn arms dealers like Yuri Orlov. What it does condemn is the political atmosphere and machinations behind the global scene that makes such people necessary. Even though Orlov is not a true person he does seem based off the actual life and events of one Victor Bout whose life and career as an arms dealer mirrors that of Yuri's.Niccol's Lord of War is not a perfect film, but it is very timely in this new age of a world become more complicated with the end of the Cold War with terrorists, warlords and atrocities committed by the poorests of nations and its people. The heavy-handed message told through the film is saved by the excellent work by Nicholas Cage as the title character with great support from Eamonn Walker as Liberian Warlord Baptiste.

Lord of War is one of those artier films, but it has the ability to cross over to audiences who don't normally think of themselves as enjoying such movies. Think of it as the Goodfellas of gun-running.Lord of War is a blend of comedy and drama, weighted on the dramatic side, telling the whirlwind story of how a boy from Brighton Beach became one of the world's biggest arms dealers. The movie moves too fast for us ever to learn much about most of the characters, but the actors are mostly up to the cast, sketching out their characters in a few quick strokes that suggest hidden detail the viewer never gets to see.In particular, Jared Leto plays Yuri's younger brother who is tormented by the morality of their livelihood. Leto sinks his teeth into an arguably underwritten role and serves as the canary in the moral coalmine.Cage is his typical mix of manic and obsessive in a role where both work, and Bridget Moynahan is radiant while still bringing gravity to her role later in the film.The movie has no easy answers for the moral questions it raises.A solid recommendation for fans of intelligent crime movies, Nicholas Cage and Bridget Moynahan.",4,The Goodfellas of gun-running,1138233600,"01 26, 2006",2006,1337,"['Nicholas', 'Cage', 'do', 'classic', 'now', 'somewhat', 'uncommon', 'practice', 'making', 'highly', 'commercial', 'movie', 'pay', 'bills', 'followed', 'more', 'interesting', 'more', 'arty', 'film', 'Lord', 'War', 'one', 'artier', 'films', 'ability', 'cross', 'audiences', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'think', 'enjoying', 'such', 'movies', 'Think', 'Goodfellas', 'gun-running.Lord', 'War', 'blend', 'comedy', 'drama', 'weighted', 'dramatic', 'side', 'telling', 'whirlwind', 'story', 'how', 'boy', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'became', 'one', 'world', 'biggest', 'arms', 'dealers', 'movie', 'too', 'fast', 'ever', 'learn', 'much', 'most', 'characters', 'actors', 'are', 'mostly', 'cast', 'sketching', 'out', 'characters', 'few', 'quick', 'strokes', 'suggest', 'hidden', 'detail', 'viewer', 'never', 'see.In', 'particular', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Yuri', 'younger', 'brother', 'who', 'tormented', 'morality', 'livelihood', 'Leto', 'teeth', 'arguably', 'underwritten', 'role', 'canary', 'moral', 'coalmine.Cage', 'typical', 'mix', 'manic', 'obsessive', 'role', 'where', 'work', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'radiant', 'still', 'bringing', 'gravity', 'role', 'later', 'film.The', 'movie', 'easy', 'answers', 'moral', 'questions', 'raises.A', 'solid', 'recommendation', 'fans', 'intelligent', 'crime', 'movies', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan']",N/A

Marold""","[3, 4]","`Lord of War', written and directed by Andrew Niccol, starring (and co-produced by) Nicolas Cage is a slightly better than average Nicholas Cage vehicle which at least some reviewers represented among the blurbs on the cover seem to misuderstand. At least two blurbs describe the film as a `thriller', but it is definitely not a `thriller' in any normal sense of the term. My best description of the nature of the movie may be a `biopic' based on a parody of a `New Yorker' profile of a fictional arms dealer.The movie is much more about motives, personality, and development of the Cage character, a Ukranian emigrant to `little Odessa' in Brooklyn who develops his `shady' to illegal arms trade from selling Uzi's to mercenaries to selling tanks and attack helicopters to African insurgents and strong men. The flick is not a thriller because aside from a few short incidents, there is never any enduring threat to the principle characters or any great mystery about Cage's character or his enterprises. By comparison, the great thriller, `The Usual Suspects' creates a big puzzle from the very beginning which grows with developments until it is resolved only in the very last scene. Nothing like that is going on here. There is even very little mystery or suspense over whether Cage's character will succeed with his romantic campaign.This movie is all about the principle character's morality, the morality, or more accurately the strong legal sense of his antagonist, the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, and the advice the principle gets from veteran arms dealer played by Ian Holm, and the consequences of following Holm's advice.This movie is not quite as engaging as Cages's best flicks, such as `Adaptation', `Matchstick Man', or even the action movie `Con Air'. But, it is a whole lot better than some of Cage's stinkers such as `War Birds'.Actully, one of the most interesting things about the movie is what we learn about the illegal weapons trade and how it was affected by the end of the cold war. One almost expects these types of characters to be either outright scoundrels or inept. Cage is neither. He succeeds in escaping from the dual perils of the law and his unsavory customers.Unlike `Con Air' and even `Adaptation', this movie suffers a bit from the rather light cast. There is no one like  John Malkovich against which he can play.All in all, this is still a worthwhile movie, although the DVD extras are remarkably slim, probably because there is another 2 disk version, of course, for a higher price!",4,Character Study of a Successful Arms Dealer.,1140480000,"02 21, 2006",2006,2534,"['Lord', 'War', 'written', 'directed', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'starring', 'co-produced', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'slightly', 'better', 'average', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'vehicle', 'least', 'reviewers', 'represented', 'blurbs', 'cover', 'seem', 'misuderstand', 'least', 'two', 'blurbs', 'describe', 'film', 'thriller', 'definitely', 'not', 'thriller', 'normal', 'sense', 'term', 'best', 'description', 'nature', 'movie', 'may', 'be', 'biopic', 'based', 'parody', 'New', 'Yorker', 'profile', 'fictional', 'arms', 'dealer.The', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'motives', 'personality', 'development', 'Cage', 'character', 'Ukranian', 'emigrant', 'little', 'Odessa', 'Brooklyn', 'who', 'shady', 'illegal', 'arms', 'trade', 'selling', 'Uzi', 'mercenaries', 'selling', 'tanks', 'attack', 'helicopters', 'African', 'insurgents', 'strong', 'men', 'flick', 'not', 'thriller', 'aside', 'few', 'short', 'incidents', 'never', 'enduring', 'threat', 'principle', 'characters', 'great', 'mystery', 'Cage', 'character', 'enterprises', 'comparison', 'great', 'thriller', 'Usual', 'Suspects', 'big', 'puzzle', 'very', 'beginning', 'developments', 'resolved', 'only', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'Nothing', 'going', 'here', 'even', 'very', 'little', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'Cage', 'character', 'will', 'succeed', 'romantic', 'campaign.This', 'movie', 'principle', 'character', 'morality', 'morality', 'more', 'accurately', 'strong', 'legal', 'sense', 'antagonist', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'played', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'advice', 'principle', 'veteran', 'arms', 'dealer', 'played', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'consequences', 'following', 'Holm', 'advice.This', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'engaging', 'Cages', 'best', 'flicks', 'such', 'Adaptation', 'Matchstick', 'Man', 'even', 'action', 'movie', 'Con', 'Air', 'whole', 'lot', 'better', 'Cage', 'stinkers', 'such', 'War', ""Birds'.Actully"", 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'things', 'movie', 'what', 'learn', 'illegal', 'weapons', 'trade', 'how', 'was', 'affected', 'end', 'cold', 'war', 'One', 'almost', 'types', 'characters', 'be', 'either', 'outright', 'scoundrels', 'inept', 'Cage', 'neither', 'escaping', 'dual', 'perils', 'law', 'unsavory', 'customers.Unlike', 'Con', 'Air', 'even', 'Adaptation', 'movie', 'bit', 'rather', 'light', 'cast', 'one', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'can', 'play.All', 'still', 'worthwhile', 'movie', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'remarkably', 'slim', 'probably', '2', 'disk', 'version', 'course', 'higher', 'price']",N/A
952757,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,B000BYA5G4,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[174, 185]","I'm kind of shocked to see poor reviews of this film here at Amazon.com. I think part of the reason some individuals didn't enjoy the film is that they didn't explore the depths of the characters very well; and this is definitely a character-driven film.Nicholas Cage is perfect at Yuri Olav, a Ukrainian native who's family moved to America years before. They run a substandard Russian restaurant that serves borscht (beet soup) as a staple. Their father has become a devout Jew. And Yuri and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM) help with the restaurant. Then one day, after witnessing a failed assassination attempt, Yuri receives an epiphany: everyone needs guns. Thus the stage is set for him to become one of the premiere arms dealers in the world.Against the backdrop of Yuri's life, we get to see the effects of his chosen profession upon his brother's psyche. Vitaly gets into drugs and women, anything he can to help him forget that he and his brother are involved in a business that allows people to kill other people. And when Yuri gives up gun running for a while, Vitaly too comes back to a semblance of normalcy. But when Yuri returns to guns, and asks Vitaly to join him, the stress becomes overwhelming (this is something that I have yet to see any other reviewer comment on and, the way Jared Leto pulls off his excellent portrayal of Yuri's brother, it's a pretty powerful message.)I also think that many reviewers may not understand the mentality of a sociopath. Their moral compass is broken, according to our standards. So when Yuri (Cage) doesn't grow out of his morally ambiguous state, it didn't surprise me one little bit.Also, Nicholas Cage is a deadpan actor, and that's probably why they chose him. Remember RAISING ARIZONA and the diaper scene in the convenience store? Or LEAVING LAS VEGAS? Or BRINGING OUT THE DEAD? Cage was the only person I could think of who could pull off a convincing Yuri.I also need to comment on the brutal message that smacks the viewer. From the opening sequence in the film where we see Yuri standing in a war-torn street surrounded by a paved street covered in spent gun shells, to the scene where Vitaly witnesses the execution of children in Africa, there's not a single moment in the film where the biting reality of what Yuri does and how it effects those around him isn't displayed.One thing that really intrigued me, too, is that I saw the film's trailer on TV long before the movie came out, and they always showed the bit where Yuri is in the airport and is approached by agents from the ATF, and Yuri says ""I guess this isn't about the alcohol or tobacco."" I laughed at the trailer. But interestingly enough, once that scene came up on screen in context to the rest of the plot, there was very little comedy in it and the message much more powerful and poignant.This film definitely had it's comedic moments, but laughing at it is oft-times painful to think about because of what we see Yuri and his brother go through later.",4,A Sociopath on the Edge,1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,3011,"[""'m"", 'kind', 'shocked', 'see', 'poor', 'reviews', 'film', 'here', 'Amazon.com', 'think', 'part', 'reason', 'individuals', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'explore', 'depths', 'characters', 'very', 'well', 'definitely', 'character-driven', 'film.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'perfect', 'Yuri', 'Olav', 'Ukrainian', 'native', 'who', 'family', 'moved', 'America', 'years', 'before', 'run', 'substandard', 'Russian', 'restaurant', 'borscht', 'beet', 'soup', 'staple', 'father', 'become', 'devout', 'Jew', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'Vitaly', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'REQUIEM', 'FOR', 'A', 'DREAM', 'help', 'restaurant', 'Then', 'one', 'day', 'witnessing', 'failed', 'assassination', 'attempt', 'Yuri', 'epiphany', 'everyone', 'guns', 'Thus', 'stage', 'set', 'become', 'one', 'premiere', 'dealers', 'world.Against', 'backdrop', 'Yuri', 'life', 'get', 'see', 'effects', 'chosen', 'profession', 'brother', 'psyche', 'Vitaly', 'drugs', 'women', 'anything', 'can', 'help', 'forget', 'brother', 'are', 'involved', 'business', 'people', 'kill', 'other', 'people', 'when', 'Yuri', 'up', 'gun', 'running', 'while', 'Vitaly', 'too', 'back', 'semblance', 'normalcy', 'when', 'Yuri', 'guns', 'Vitaly', 'join', 'stress', 'overwhelming', 'something', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'other', 'reviewer', 'comment', 'way', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'message', 'also', 'think', 'many', 'reviewers', 'may', 'not', 'understand', 'mentality', 'sociopath', 'moral', 'compass', 'broken', 'according', 'standards', 'So', 'when', 'Yuri', 'Cage', ""n't"", 'grow', 'morally', 'ambiguous', 'state', 'did', ""n't"", 'surprise', 'one', 'little', 'bit.Also', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'deadpan', 'actor', 'probably', 'why', 'chose', 'Remember', 'RAISING', 'ARIZONA', 'diaper', 'scene', 'convenience', 'store', 'LEAVING', 'LAS', 'VEGAS', 'BRINGING', 'OUT', 'DEAD', 'Cage', 'was', 'only', 'person', 'could', 'think', 'who', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'convincing', 'Yuri.I', 'also', 'need', 'comment', 'brutal', 'message', 'viewer', 'opening', 'sequence', 'film', 'where', 'see', 'Yuri', 'standing', 'war-torn', 'street', 'surrounded', 'paved', 'street', 'covered', 'spent', 'gun', 'shells', 'scene', 'where', 'Vitaly', 'execution', 'children', 'Africa', 'not', 'single', 'moment', 'film', 'where', 'biting', 'reality', 'what', 'Yuri', 'how', 'effects', ""n't"", 'displayed.One', 'thing', 'really', 'intrigued', 'too', 'saw', 'film', 'trailer', 'TV', 'long', 'movie', 'came', 'out', 'always', 'showed', 'bit', 'where', 'Yuri', 'airport', 'approached', 'agents', 'ATF', 'Yuri', 'guess', ""n't"", 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'laughed', 'trailer', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'once', 'scene', 'came', 'up', 'screen', 'context', 'rest', 'plot', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'comedy', 'message', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'poignant.This', 'film', 'definitely', 'had', 'comedic', 'moments', 'laughing', 'oft-times', 'painful', 'think', 'what', 'see', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'go', 'later']",N/A

In the end, unhappily, its main message is corrupted and fails.Nicolas Cage gives one of his best performances playing Yuri Orlov, a self-absorbed loner turned arms merchant.  The movie's tension revolves around the duplicity and mendacity of Yuri.  He has a trophy wife, wooed by lies and money.  He has a younger brother whose drug addiction and unhappiness arise from being co-opted by Yuri into helping with the arms dealing; his depression is enhanced by Yuri's strange doses of misdirected brotherly love.  Tension grows as we wonder:  Will Yuri give up arms dealing, and become the person his family needs?  Will we discover what motivates Yuri, and men like him, to deal arms in the midst of the savagery and death that he is selling?This story is well done, and is compelling viewing.  But Niccol goes too far in portraying Yuri as an isolated loner, traveling the world with no more than his brother at his right arm, and his quick wits as his guide.  This portrayal clearly settles into fantasy land:  a actual multimillionaire gun-runner like Yuri could not travel the world without lawyers, accountants, strong-arm men, etc., a complete retinue, gang, mini-mafia of people that would take care of details, such as keeping Interpol agents well away from their affairs.The rub for Lord of War is that the crucial story cannot be that of Yuri, as interesting as it is portrayed.  Niccol and the viewers cannot escape the awful realities about arms dealing, and the message about governments that not only turn a blind's eye, but actively participate.  The movie ends strong, and hits all these notes hard.  But by this time, Niccol has lost credibility with his portrayal of Yuri.  Fantasy does not belong here, and we know it.

To get out of his crappy life in Little Odessa, he begins selling guns to local mobsters. His business becomes larger and larger until he is the top gun runner in the world, besting a rival who had looked down on him. When communism falls in the Ukraine, he goes to see his uncle who is a Colonel in the Red army. Together they sell Russian guns, tanks, helicopters and missiles because the government is in such disarray no one is watching.Along the way, Orlov marries his dreamgirl, a model and struggles to help his brother stay clean of drugs and alcohol. The wife knows her husband isn't on the up and up but doesn't want to know because she says she doesn't want him to lie to her. In the end, when she finds everything out and leaves him, it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for her. Ethan Hawke plays a Javert-like Interpol agent trying desperately to put Yuri away.

Even here, in the west, with all our so called civilization and culture, it's still unsafe to walk the streets.Take any major city, even my hometown of Calgary. There is crime. Petty crime, white collar crime, so called `victimless' crime, and of course, the daddy of them all - violent crime.Canada prides itself in being low on the totem pole of violent crime involving firearms. But the fact remains thus - no matter where you are, there will always be a need for guns. The criminals will always be able to get guns, no matter what the police and the government tries do to about it.In the states, and correct me if I'm wrong, but it's been said that there are more gun-shops than there are McDonalds.The same can't be said about Canada. We've got strict rules governing weapons here in Canada. You have to apply for a F.A.C. or Firearms Acquisition Certificate. This involves a background check and other safety measures.You even have to proof you have successfully completed a firearms safety training course or test, or have been certified as competent to use a firearm.Pretty amazing, isn't it?  What's even more amazing is, despite these strict rules, what kinds of weapons can be brought into the country. I recall reading the Calgary Sun earlier this week and looking at the picture of the weapons seized. There was an assault rifle with a GRENADE LAUNCHER!A Grenade Launcher!It's pretty damn clear that even in Canada, if you want a weapon, you can get it. And yetIf you're willing to pay the fees.You can get your weapons from the criminal element, or from Gunrunners.I guess you could almost take Lord of War to be a biography, a life story of one particular Gun runner named Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian Immigrant to the states.He started out his career as most criminals do. He started small. But as time passed and he gained experience, he went from being a small time runner to one who had ties in very high places, and buyers world-wide.Although like a drug dealer, he followed a simple rule. Don't use what you sell. It served him well. Keep yourself separated from your clients. Don't get involved except to seal the deal.Can you, however, stay neutral? Can you deal in weapons of death and destruction without feeling the ramifications, one way or another?Can you ever get out? Can you have a chance at ever going legit?And, the biggest question. Can you deal with the consequences of your actions? Can you sew what you've reaped, even if you've tried to stay at arms length?Lord of War doesn't glorify Gun-runners. It doesn't show it as a glamorous lifestyle, even if the money is good.It shows you what they deal in, and what it's used for. One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. A Hero to the people on one side, a practitioner of genocide to another.This movie isn't sugar coated, nor does it shy away from violence.As per usual, Nicholas Cage does a fine job of portraying a smart and resourceful criminal. And let's not forget that, he is a criminal in this movie.One last note... as with anything, we here in North America should never take for granted what we have. Sure, there is crime, there is hunger and homelessness, but when you consider what it's like in other countries, especially the Middle East and Africa, and even parts of Europe and Asia, we've got it lucky.After all, we could live in these countries where `Lords of War' earn their daily bread.4 out of 5",4,A sobering look at the world of gun running,1194652800,"11 10, 2007",2007,3480,"['world', 'dangerous', 'place', 'always', 'been', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'Even', 'here', 'west', 'so', 'called', 'civilization', 'culture', 'still', 'unsafe', 'walk', 'streets.Take', 'major', 'city', 'even', 'hometown', 'Calgary', 'crime', 'Petty', 'crime', 'white', 'collar', 'crime', 'so', 'called', 'victimless', 'crime', 'course', 'daddy', 'violent', 'crime.Canada', 'being', 'low', 'totem', 'pole', 'violent', 'crime', 'involving', 'firearms', 'fact', 'thus', 'matter', 'where', 'are', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'need', 'guns', 'criminals', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'able', 'get', 'guns', 'matter', 'what', 'police', 'government', 'tries', 'do', 'about', 'states', 'correct', ""'m"", 'wrong', 'been', 'said', 'are', 'more', 'gun-shops', 'are', 'McDonalds.The', 'same', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'Canada', ""'ve"", 'got', 'strict', 'rules', 'governing', 'weapons', 'here', 'Canada', 'have', 'apply', 'F.A.C', 'Firearms', 'Acquisition', 'Certificate', 'background', 'check', 'other', 'safety', 'measures.You', 'even', 'have', 'proof', 'have', 'successfully', 'completed', 'firearms', 'safety', 'training', 'course', 'test', 'have', 'been', 'certified', 'competent', 'use', 'firearm.Pretty', 'amazing', ""n't"", 'What', 'even', 'more', 'amazing', 'strict', 'rules', 'what', 'weapons', 'can', 'be', 'brought', 'country', 'recall', 'reading', 'Calgary', 'Sun', 'earlier', 'week', 'looking', 'picture', 'weapons', 'seized', 'was', 'assault', 'rifle', 'GRENADE', 'LAUNCHER', 'A', 'Grenade', 'Launcher', 'pretty', 'damn', 'clear', 'even', 'Canada', 'want', 'weapon', 'can', 'get', 'yetIf', ""'re"", 'willing', 'pay', 'fees.You', 'can', 'get', 'weapons', 'criminal', 'element', 'Gunrunners.I', 'guess', 'could', 'almost', 'take', 'Lord', 'War', 'be', 'biography', 'life', 'story', 'one', 'particular', 'Gun', 'runner', 'named', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Ukrainian', 'Immigrant', 'states.He', 'started', 'out', 'career', 'most', 'criminals', 'do', 'started', 'small', 'time', 'passed', 'gained', 'experience', 'went', 'being', 'small', 'time', 'runner', 'one', 'who', 'had', 'ties', 'very', 'high', 'places', 'buyers', 'world-wide.Although', 'drug', 'dealer', 'followed', 'simple', 'rule', 'Do', ""n't"", 'use', 'what', 'sell', 'served', 'well', 'Keep', 'separated', 'clients', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'involved', 'seal', 'deal.Can', 'however', 'stay', 'neutral', 'Can', 'deal', 'weapons', 'death', 'destruction', 'feeling', 'ramifications', 'one', 'way', 'Can', 'ever', 'get', 'out', 'Can', 'have', 'chance', 'ever', 'going', 'legit', 'biggest', 'question', 'Can', 'deal', 'consequences', 'actions', 'Can', 'sew', 'what', ""'ve"", 'reaped', 'even', ""'ve"", 'tried', 'stay', 'arms', 'length', 'Lord', 'War', ""n't"", 'glorify', 'Gun-runners', ""n't"", 'show', 'glamorous', 'lifestyle', 'even', 'money', 'good.It', 'shows', 'what', 'deal', 'what', 'used', 'One', 'man', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'man', 'terrorist', 'Hero', 'people', 'one', 'side', 'practitioner', 'genocide', 'another.This', 'movie', ""n't"", 'sugar', 'coated', 'shy', 'away', 'violence.As', 'usual', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'fine', 'job', 'portraying', 'smart', 'resourceful', 'criminal', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'criminal', 'movie.One', 'last', 'note', 'anything', 'here', 'North', 'America', 'should', 'never', 'take', 'granted', 'what', 'have', 'Sure', 'crime', 'hunger', 'homelessness', 'when', 'consider', 'what', 'other', 'countries', 'especially', 'Middle', 'East', 'Africa', 'even', 'parts', 'Europe', 'Asia', ""'ve"", 'got', 'lucky.After', 'all', 'could', 'live', 'countries', 'where', 'Lords', 'War', 'earn', 'daily', 'bread.4', '5']",N/A

What he does is somewhat akin to the black market, in the sense that he is not an official weapons manufacturer or seller, instead he deals secretly under the goverments noses. Orlov's huge stock pile of weapons mainly comes from military surplus and abandoned weapons in warzones. He bribes military personell including border patrols to run across to other countries. He sells all types of guns, tanks and even attack helicopters to any country or militia willing to pay the price. He lives in glitz and glamour, in a giant penthouse, has a model trophy wife and owns his own line of air transports, travels the world and makes tons of cash, and sometimes gets paid in conflict diamonds as a form of currency.Underneath the glitz, glamour and allure of the lifestyle, Orlov lives a very dangerous and depressing life. He lies to his wife, by claiming that he works in ""imports/exports"", his brother gets hooked on drugs and has to constantly send him to drug rehabilitation, he and his partners are being chased by Interpol (international police), the mafia syndicates threatened to kill him if his weapon's prices were too high or didn't want to accept cocaine as payment, warlords and malitia got angry if they didn't get their weapons to execute innocent civilians or rivals. Orlov tries to mask his dark world, by trying to make his family happy and living in luxery, when in fact his life is a business of death. He is death's best friend and he realizes this. Orlov, trades his soul and morality for money. To him it's a dirty business but someone has to do it and besides...he is very good at it. Nicolas Cage played the part to perfection, the story was compelling and his narritive style just pulls you in. Great cast of actors in a very unique film. I think not many people liked it because of the slow pace. A lot of the film's time was lost in Jared Leto's character as, Vitaly, the drug addicted brother. There is the constant narration (by Cage) done in monotone voice which some people may not like. Also, some people may have been mislead by the movie's title ""Lord of War"" then expecting to see a war movie. This is not a war movie.

Those who appreciate an interesting story and great visuals will like this one.Nicholas Cage was terrific as the lead character, ""Yuri Orlov."" I loved his narration, too. How much of what he said is true, I have no idea, but it's fascinating stuff.I felt those visuals, combined with the outstanding acting and always-interesting story made this a good film. It also proved you don't need action every two minutes to keep a film involving for the audience. This has just the right amount of drama, suspense, action, romance and, yes, even humor.I do have to warn some that the message is a pessimistic one: that evil always wins in the world. According to Bible of ""Yuri,"" in the end, the meek won't inherit the earth; the arms dealers will and that evil rules, so why fight it and yourself over it? Wow, what uplifting words to live by.Outside of Yuri's wife ""Ava"" (Bridget Moynahan) and the man who pursues him, ""Jack Valentine"" (Ethan Hawke) no one in here has much in the way of high-ground morals. At least they made the lawman an honest; that's rare in films today.Amir Mokri is the cinematographer and Andrew Niccol, the director, who combined to make this movie look so stylish and beautiful to see. Looking at Mokri's resume, I see he's done a number of stylish films. Niccol hasn't directed much but what he has also offers interesting visuals.Looking at the front and back cover of the DVD might make you think this is just another of these brainless action flicks, but it is not.

The movie cost about $40 million to make and only did $24 million in U.S. box office (but $62 million world wide), so I think the public got it about right.  What is the problem with the movie?  Well, first of all, and there are exceptions to this, if the story is mostly told in narration and the movie is used to illustrate the narration, it usually means the screenplay has real problems.  And that is certainly true here.  It would be incoherent without the Nicolas Cage voice over.Another big problem with the movie is that it not only has a point of view, and not only has that point of view brightly attached to its sleeve, I felt like I was viewing a propaganda film against the arms trade.  Yes, it is a film against the arms trade, and that is fine (if you want to make a film about that), but it doesn't try to be balanced in any way.  It is really a smear of arms and arms dealers by loading them up - particularly Cage's character (Yuri Orlov) - with all kinds of reptilian and decadent traits; almost inhuman.  After all, how could you sell weapons to people who were going to use them against civilians unless you were a monster?  Never mind, that in the key scene in the movie the weapons we see used on a woman and child are machetes, which can be made anywhere out of any kind of steel you can put an edge on and attach a handle to.Look, I am not arguing FOR the arms trade, just against the way it is portrayed in this movie.  It probably is corrupt and surreal.  However, they point out that this story is based on actual events.  Except that when you watch the extra features we learn that the Ukrainian the story is based on lived in Italy, not the U.S. and he got off because of a loophole in Italian law rather than being protected by corrupt officials in the U.S. government who used him to keep the fingerprints off of some deals.  Now, that may well be done, I don't know.  But real events showing such transactions were not shown in this film.Still, the movie has some pretty funny scenes (funny in a very dark way).  However, there is real violence - beginning with the powerful opening montage (done in computer graphics) of the life of a bullet for an AK-47 from its being made in Russia until it is used in Africa.  There is also some very sexual scenes and depictions of drug use - again to show how the arms trade saps the humanity out of those who practice it.  Pretty heavy handed depictions, too.So, if you are interested in another film blasting blood diamonds, the weapons trade, and the major world governments -  but particularly the character of Americans, hey this is a movie for you.",3,Basically a propaganda film masquerading as a dark comedy,1167609600,"01 1, 2007",2007,2742,"['do', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'movie', 'deserved', 'critical', 'praise', 'received', 'movie', 'cost', '40', 'million', 'make', 'only', 'did', '24', 'million', 'U.S.', 'box', 'office', '62', 'million', 'world', 'wide', 'so', 'think', 'public', 'got', 'right', 'What', 'problem', 'movie', 'Well', 'first', 'are', 'exceptions', 'story', 'mostly', 'told', 'narration', 'movie', 'used', 'illustrate', 'narration', 'usually', 'screenplay', 'real', 'problems', 'certainly', 'true', 'here', 'would', 'be', 'incoherent', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'voice', 'over.Another', 'big', 'problem', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'point', 'view', 'not', 'only', 'point', 'view', 'brightly', 'attached', 'sleeve', 'felt', 'was', 'viewing', 'propaganda', 'film', 'arms', 'trade', 'Yes', 'film', 'arms', 'trade', 'fine', 'want', 'make', 'film', ""n't"", 'try', 'be', 'balanced', 'way', 'really', 'smear', 'arms', 'arms', 'dealers', 'loading', 'up', 'particularly', 'Cage', 'character', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'kinds', 'reptilian', 'decadent', 'traits', 'almost', 'inhuman', 'how', 'could', 'sell', 'weapons', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'going', 'use', 'civilians', 'were', 'monster', 'Never', 'mind', 'key', 'scene', 'movie', 'weapons', 'see', 'used', 'woman', 'child', 'are', 'machetes', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'anywhere', 'kind', 'steel', 'can', 'put', 'edge', 'attach', 'handle', 'to.Look', 'am', 'not', 'arguing', 'arms', 'trade', 'just', 'way', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'probably', 'corrupt', 'surreal', 'However', 'point', 'out', 'story', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'when', 'watch', 'extra', 'features', 'learn', 'Ukrainian', 'story', 'based', 'lived', 'Italy', 'not', 'U.S.', 'got', 'off', 'loophole', 'Italian', 'law', 'rather', 'being', 'protected', 'corrupt', 'officials', 'U.S.', 'government', 'who', 'used', 'keep', 'fingerprints', 'deals', 'Now', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'done', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'real', 'events', 'showing', 'such', 'transactions', 'were', 'not', 'shown', 'film.Still', 'movie', 'pretty', 'funny', 'scenes', 'funny', 'very', 'dark', 'way', 'However', 'real', 'violence', 'beginning', 'powerful', 'opening', 'montage', 'done', 'computer', 'graphics', 'life', 'bullet', 'AK-47', 'being', 'made', 'Russia', 'used', 'Africa', 'also', 'very', 'sexual', 'scenes', 'depictions', 'drug', 'use', 'again', 'show', 'how', 'arms', 'trade', 'saps', 'humanity', 'who', 'practice', 'Pretty', 'heavy', 'handed', 'depictions', 'too.So', 'are', 'interested', 'film', 'blasting', 'blood', 'diamonds', 'weapons', 'trade', 'major', 'world', 'governments', 'particularly', 'character', 'Americans', 'hey', 'movie']",N/A

Horribly mis-cast, Nicolas Cage just doesn't have the gravitas to play a gun dealer. He's often up-staged by lesser character actors who do a great job. The story begins in NYC with Cage's character realizing he can make money selling guns. From there it's off to the races as he makes ever bigger deals, including some with his uncle who happens to be a general in the Ukraine, when the Soviet Union collapses and there's tons of guns, tanks, and helicopters to be had for the price of a bribe. Cage drags along his addict of a little brother as he's pursued by a determined interpol agent who shows up from time to time. Cage frequently escapes in the most absurd ways. There's the typical love interest, again, wasted potential and story time. Most amazing is that this movie comes from the same director as Gattaca and The Truman Show. Clearly the man knows what he's doing. One has to wonder, what was he thinking, making this piece with a good actor but in the wrong role? Save your money and petition for a re-make with heavy duty people who can carry the heavy load of a gun runner risking it all.

952788,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000BYA5G4,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[8, 10]","- REVIEWFor everyone who says their job is rough, whether it's for being a janitor, pizza delivery man, or being one of the half-wits that worked in cubicles, YOU try working as a free-lancing international arms dealer!  In that profession, one thing's clear: you screw up, you get shot.  Nicholas Cage gives a nonchalant, yet superb performance in the most nihilistic film I've seen this year, ""Lord of War.""  Dark and violent with black humor that effectively blend the course of the content, this is the kind of film that would make Kurt Vonnegut proud...if he watches films with rarely sedative themes.The film starts in a field of used bullets, and Nicholas Cage as Yuri stands in the middle of it, surrounding by the sounds of gunfights.  Yuri is an arms dealer, and he talks to the audience about his profession.  He's not trying to teach you a lesson about his experience, he's just talking about his experience as it is.  In a fashionable narrative (the same narrative that people in amazon.com are downsizing about), Yuri strolls down to memory lane when he first came to America in the 80s, and later sees his first sight of gunshots in a restaurant, leading to his fascination of selling guns.As years passed when he worked as a lackey in a practice to sell guns, Yuri then becomes a sole proprietor of an arms dealing business.  With his gifted talent of negotiating deals and getting out of trouble, he alone travels from one corrupted country to another, selling off his ""merchandise"" to some of the most notorious dictators in world.  At the same time, he's playing multiple lives not only for the customers but for his family, besides his brother, who doesn't know his profession.Because he's working in a black business, there's always the ""Zenigata"" that tries to stop this ""Lupin"" from commiting more crimes. Ethan Hawke plays a CIA agent who's on the hunt to find Yuri and arrest him for arms smuggling, though Yuri's always one step ahead by hiding the evidence and make him look wholesome.  Even when Yuri gets away from the CIA, he can't get away with the fact that his job is the most hellish thing he must deal with and it alienates him from his family, but he can't help it, because he's good with it.This is a heavy tale coming from Yuri.  Whether he's at Columbia or Liberia, there are graphic killings and massacres happening (and they are based on actual events), and it was all thanks to the guns he sold.  But he never questions how customers are using the weapons, since it would hurt his business, and by the end of the day, it's all about the business.  He should be considered a bad person for selling arms to criminal countries, but then we're also living in criminal countries.  That's what's so nihilistic about this movie: it subliminally shows what the US and other 'civil' countries are doing even before Yuri sold his first gun.  As cruel as this movie shows, it's a common practice that continues to reach massive profits, at the cost of massive casualties.It doesn't hurt that ""Lord of War"" is also hilarious.  Yep, despite the violent elements, the movie has a wicked sense of humor.  There are many moments in this movie that laughed my butt off: the scene where Yuri and his family have to become Jewish, even though they are Ukranians; Yuri giving his brother a line of pot to sniff before sending him to rehad; a weapons convention (??); and the vicious moments that deal between Yuri and the high leader of Liberia, whose played by Kareem Sa---I mean, Eammon Walker (Damn you, OZ).  Even with its funny moments, it doesn't stray far from being so brutal, and by the end of the movie, the feeling of laughter and sorrow is thought-provoking.The problems with this movie?  Well, more plot could've been involved in Yuri's youth, and the ending could be better without the view of sentimentality.  And that's it, really.""Lord of War"" is a sleeper hit, and it's unfortunate that not many people have give this movie a viewing consideration. these people have missed out on the sardonic writing and brilliant concept.  Don't you be the one to miss out on this shocking film, so go out and see ""Lord of War""; it might shoot you in the heart (figuratively speaking).This is Del Keyes, saying ""Guns are bad, unless they're worth something.""",5,Bullets Banging Big Bucks,1128384000,"10 4, 2005",2005,4284,"['REVIEWFor', 'everyone', 'who', 'job', 'rough', 'being', 'janitor', 'pizza', 'delivery', 'man', 'being', 'one', 'half-wits', 'worked', 'cubicles', 'YOU', 'try', 'working', 'free-lancing', 'international', 'arms', 'dealer', 'profession', 'one', 'thing', 'clear', 'screw', 'up', 'get', 'shot', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'nonchalant', 'yet', 'superb', 'performance', 'most', 'nihilistic', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'year', 'Lord', 'War', 'Dark', 'violent', 'black', 'humor', 'effectively', 'blend', 'course', 'content', 'kind', 'film', 'would', 'make', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'proud', 'films', 'rarely', 'sedative', 'themes.The', 'film', 'field', 'used', 'bullets', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Yuri', 'middle', 'surrounding', 'sounds', 'gunfights', 'Yuri', 'arms', 'dealer', 'audience', 'profession', 'not', 'trying', 'teach', 'lesson', 'experience', 'just', 'talking', 'experience', 'fashionable', 'narrative', 'same', 'narrative', 'people', 'amazon.com', 'are', 'downsizing', 'Yuri', 'down', 'memory', 'lane', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'America', '80s', 'later', 'sees', 'first', 'sight', 'gunshots', 'restaurant', 'leading', 'fascination', 'selling', 'guns.As', 'years', 'passed', 'when', 'worked', 'lackey', 'practice', 'sell', 'guns', 'Yuri', 'then', 'sole', 'proprietor', 'arms', 'dealing', 'business', 'gifted', 'talent', 'negotiating', 'deals', 'getting', 'trouble', 'alone', 'one', 'corrupted', 'country', 'selling', 'off', 'merchandise', 'most', 'notorious', 'dictators', 'world', 'same', 'time', 'playing', 'multiple', 'lives', 'not', 'only', 'customers', 'family', 'brother', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'profession.Because', 'working', 'black', 'business', 'always', 'Zenigata', 'stop', 'Lupin', 'commiting', 'more', 'crimes', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'CIA', 'agent', 'who', 'hunt', 'find', 'Yuri', 'arrest', 'arms', 'smuggling', 'Yuri', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'hiding', 'evidence', 'make', 'look', 'wholesome', 'Even', 'when', 'Yuri', 'away', 'CIA', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'away', 'fact', 'job', 'most', 'hellish', 'thing', 'must', 'deal', 'family', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'good', 'it.This', 'heavy', 'tale', 'coming', 'Yuri', 'Whether', 'Columbia', 'Liberia', 'are', 'graphic', 'killings', 'massacres', 'happening', 'are', 'based', 'actual', 'events', 'was', 'thanks', 'guns', 'sold', 'never', 'questions', 'how', 'customers', 'are', 'using', 'weapons', 'would', 'hurt', 'business', 'end', 'day', 'business', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'bad', 'person', 'selling', 'arms', 'criminal', 'countries', 'then', ""'re"", 'also', 'living', 'criminal', 'countries', 'what', 'so', 'nihilistic', 'movie', 'subliminally', 'what', 'US', 'other', ""'civil"", 'countries', 'are', 'doing', 'even', 'Yuri', 'sold', 'first', 'gun', 'As', 'cruel', 'movie', 'common', 'practice', 'reach', 'massive', 'profits', 'cost', 'massive', 'casualties.It', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'Lord', 'War', 'also', 'hilarious', 'Yep', 'violent', 'elements', 'movie', 'wicked', 'sense', 'humor', 'are', 'many', 'moments', 'movie', 'laughed', 'butt', 'scene', 'where', 'Yuri', 'family', 'have', 'become', 'Jewish', 'even', 'are', 'Ukranians', 'Yuri', 'giving', 'brother', 'line', 'pot', 'sniff', 'sending', 'rehad', 'weapons', 'convention', 'vicious', 'moments', 'deal', 'Yuri', 'high', 'leader', 'Liberia', 'played', 'Kareem', 'Sa', '-I', 'mean', 'Eammon', 'Walker', 'Damn', 'OZ', 'Even', 'funny', 'moments', ""n't"", 'stray', 'far', 'being', 'so', 'brutal', 'end', 'movie', 'feeling', 'laughter', 'sorrow', 'thought-provoking.The', 'problems', 'movie', 'Well', 'more', 'plot', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'involved', 'Yuri', 'youth', 'ending', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'view', 'sentimentality', 'really', 'Lord', 'War', 'sleeper', 'hit', 'unfortunate', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'give', 'movie', 'viewing', 'consideration', 'people', 'have', 'missed', 'out', 'sardonic', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'concept', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'one', 'miss', 'out', 'shocking', 'film', 'so', 'go', 'out', 'see', 'Lord', 'War', 'might', 'shoot', 'heart', 'figuratively', 'speaking', '.This', 'Del', 'Keyes', 'saying', 'Guns', 'are', 'bad', ""'re"", 'worth', 'something']",N/A

952792,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,B000BYA5G4,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[4, 5]","""Lord of War"" is a wake up call for all people; it is a movie that emotionally effects the viewer and spotlights the reality of war that the mass media, educational systems, and social structure do not want you to understand.  The first time I viewed this movie I found myself in complete disbelief that Hollywood had actually been able to release this film, because it is the ultimate ""Reality"" show: so truthful it is scary.  In fact, without the cynical, often gut-wrenching, humor, the film would be ""too real"" to consider ""entertainment.""  I believe that it is this ""ultra realism"" that has lead to reviews that are, as stated by another reviewer, NAIVE--or cynical at best.  That there are more reviews with four or fewer stars attests to the inability/refusal of viewers to pay attention to what they are watching.  ""Lord of War"" is definitely not pure, unabashed indulgence of one's senses, but a film that requires listening and watching--engaging the film; not passing the time.As a former Combat Engineer Officer who was ""courted"" more than a few times by ""gun buyers"" and mercenaries--no I never got involved--I can assure you, like Robert D. Steele in his review, I have seen it all; and to the degree that I was ordered to abandon and bury weapons, ammunitions, and other military equipment, I was an unwilling participant in bringing war to others.The script is superb; the acting is so seamless, that it is easy to see how other reviewers describe the acting as something short of completely poor performances.  Again, Robert D. Steele puts it most succinctly: ""This is a first rate movie with some truly extraordinary visuals and some truly extraordinary lines.""  It is unfortunate that politics, personal beliefs, and a general lack of interest in understanding the world we live in must overwhelm potential viewer's interest, and thereby distract or prevent them from viewing, such a distinctly unique and powerful movie as ""Lord of War.""  When you watch the film, instead of thinking there is no way it could happen, stop and ask yourself: If this is really happening, what does it mean to me, my family, and my friends--not to mention nation?  Then look at the research and the facts out there, and you will see that ""Lord of War"" is truly entertainment (at its' best) imitating reality; that ""Lord of War"" is a movie you can watch over and over as a reality check that entertains and engages you, the viewer.Additionally, the 2-Disc Special Edition provides documentary follow-up to the statements and information made in the movie.  While these features were not ""news"" to me, they have proven very beneficial for helping others who view the film as ""too far fetched to be true,"" despite their keen awareness of my past and knowledge of such events.  They definitely add to the credibility of the movie for many.  So, hopefully, more people will be encouraged to venture into true ""reality,"" and view this film--either for the first time, or with a ""new"" understanding of what the ""Lord of War"" is about.Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.

952793,APUHDIL2CEI3C,B000BYA5G4,Dr. Victor S. Alpher,"[0, 0]","I waited a long time to review this film, and with 200-plus it is likely no one will read it.Why now? I listened to an interview with Dr. Phil Zimbardo today, famous for his early 1970s experiments on prisoners and guards at Stanford. I watched the films in college, and never forgot them. Then, I saw recently a film adaptation, located in Cologne, where I studied and lived with a German family. It is called ""Das Experiment."" For drama, there are deaths and rape of one of the experimeters.Zimbardo picked the healthiest college students for a summer study of ""prison life"" assigning them randomly as prisoners and guards to a makeshift prison on the Stanford campus.Within days, the experiment was halted. The guards had become brutal, and at least two ""prisoners"" had become nervous ponds of blather.what has this to do with ""Lord of War?"" Everything.  Except for the 1 in 100 who are born sociopaths (they decapitate cats for enjoyment as children)...how do some of the 99 of 100 become evil, and others good? Zimbardo's strong answer--environment. I tend to agree, after earning my Ph.D. and M.A. in Clinical Psychology at Vanderbilt, becoming an academic scholar, and then a consultant in private practice in Clinical and Neuro-Psychology.I have seen the film in English, German, and Russian. the images are true--Europe, America, Africa...in this drama, you see how environment creates villains, arms dealers, arming both sides, and--of interest to Zimbardo, how one brother can DIE trying to save a camp of Africans about to be slaughtered, and the other brother, an arms dealer for any side---something he learned in Brighton Beach, or Little Odessa, after fleeing Ukraine with his family masquerading as Jews in the 1970s. His father got the point--he goes to Shul frequently, but also introduces Yuri (Nicolas Cage) to some of his first gangsters.If any film heralds the environment as a creator of killers and heroes, this is it, and you can understand that in any language. Throw in love (based on beauty, a trophy of Long Island who becomes a model and then the object of Yuri's all-American desires, a little betrayal (Yuri's uncle is assassinated by a rival arms dealer), and a psychopath (the African arms purchaser) and you have it all, including the pilots who have to land their plane to avoid being shot down, carrying Yuri's latest cargo. Pursuing all the time is Interpol, represented by Ethan Hawke.Then, finally in custody, Yuri's ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card arrives--a mysterious U.S. officer, who trumps Interpol. Because, War is Business, in any language.So why no protests of G.W. Bush's ""Business Wars"" after 2008. This I do not yet comprehend. Where did all the anti-war activists go? Are they now so busily employed mowing down Detroit to be concerned. It troubles me, and after viewing this film it should trouble you. Unless, of course, you are one of the 1 in 100 that Dr. Zimbardo cites.WHY does Yuri's brother, brought into the business as a ""Brother in Arms?"" The good boy with the drug habit?  This is the missing part of the story, and it is the one that Dr. Zimbardo is now most interested in. How do we create pro-social individuals? We once relied on churches, synagogues, the schools. They have less influence now.  If you find Dr. Z's website (not difficult) please contribute to this cause, this research, because it will not be government funded. However, this research is needed now more than ever. We know the Soviets advanced only with rifles and machine guns aimed at their backs--the Heroes of the Great Patriotic War. Where are the defenders of freedom? We need to know now--before compulsory service of 18 to 24 year olds begins. Time is short. Hitler said that he didn't care what the ""adults"" thought because he had the children. They were difficult or impossible to break out of the Nazi mold--I've seen the research, and been to some of the places where this was attempted. We are in desperate times. No, I'm not a crackpot or a conspiracy theorist, I say this based on well-done research, and research that needs to be done. None of Zimbardo's ""prisoners"" became partisans. Why not?A great film for all time.",5,All Elements of Zimbardo's Vision--,1362528000,"03 6, 2013",2013,4169,"['waited', 'long', 'time', 'review', 'film', '200-plus', 'likely', 'one', 'will', 'read', 'it.Why', 'now', 'listened', 'interview', 'Dr.', 'Phil', 'Zimbardo', 'today', 'famous', 'early', '1970s', 'experiments', 'prisoners', 'guards', 'Stanford', 'watched', 'films', 'college', 'never', 'forgot', 'Then', 'saw', 'recently', 'film', 'adaptation', 'located', 'Cologne', 'where', 'studied', 'lived', 'German', 'family', 'called', 'Das', 'Experiment', 'drama', 'are', 'deaths', 'rape', 'one', 'experimeters.Zimbardo', 'picked', 'healthiest', 'college', 'students', 'summer', 'study', 'prison', 'life', 'assigning', 'randomly', 'prisoners', 'guards', 'makeshift', 'prison', 'Stanford', 'campus.Within', 'days', 'experiment', 'was', 'halted', 'guards', 'had', 'become', 'brutal', 'least', 'two', 'prisoners', 'had', 'become', 'nervous', 'ponds', 'do', 'Lord', 'War', 'Everything', '1', '100', 'who', 'are', 'born', 'sociopaths', 'decapitate', 'cats', 'enjoyment', 'children', 'how', 'do', '99', '100', 'become', 'evil', 'others', 'good', 'Zimbardo', 'strong', 'answer', 'environment', 'tend', 'agree', 'earning', 'Ph.D.', 'M.A', 'Clinical', 'Psychology', 'Vanderbilt', 'becoming', 'academic', 'scholar', 'then', 'consultant', 'private', 'practice', 'Clinical', 'Neuro-Psychology.I', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'English', 'German', 'Russian', 'images', 'are', 'true', 'Europe', 'America', 'Africa', 'drama', 'see', 'how', 'environment', 'villains', 'arms', 'dealers', 'arming', 'sides', 'interest', 'Zimbardo', 'how', 'one', 'brother', 'can', 'DIE', 'trying', 'save', 'camp', 'Africans', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'other', 'brother', 'arms', 'dealer', 'side', '-something', 'learned', 'Brighton', 'Beach', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'fleeing', 'Ukraine', 'family', 'masquerading', 'Jews', '1970s', 'father', 'got', 'point', 'Shul', 'frequently', 'also', 'introduces', 'Yuri', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'first', 'gangsters.If', 'film', 'environment', 'creator', 'killers', 'heroes', 'can', 'understand', 'language', 'Throw', 'love', 'based', 'beauty', 'trophy', 'Long', 'Island', 'who', 'model', 'then', 'object', 'Yuri', 'all-American', 'desires', 'little', 'betrayal', 'Yuri', 'uncle', 'assassinated', 'rival', 'arms', 'dealer', 'psychopath', 'African', 'arms', 'purchaser', 'have', 'including', 'pilots', 'who', 'have', 'land', 'plane', 'avoid', 'being', 'shot', 'down', 'carrying', 'Yuri', 'latest', 'cargo', 'Pursuing', 'time', 'Interpol', 'represented', 'Ethan', 'Hawke.Then', 'finally', 'custody', 'Yuri', 'Get', 'Out', 'Jail', 'Free', 'card', 'mysterious', 'U.S.', 'officer', 'who', 'trumps', 'Interpol', 'War', 'Business', 'language.So', 'why', 'protests', 'G.W', 'Bush', 'Business', 'Wars', '2008', 'do', 'not', 'yet', 'comprehend', 'Where', 'did', 'anti-war', 'activists', 'go', 'Are', 'now', 'so', 'busily', 'employed', 'mowing', 'down', 'Detroit', 'be', 'concerned', 'viewing', 'film', 'should', 'trouble', 'Unless', 'course', 'are', 'one', '1', '100', 'Dr.', 'Zimbardo', 'cites.WHY', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'brought', 'business', 'Brother', 'Arms', 'good', 'boy', 'drug', 'habit', 'missing', 'part', 'story', 'one', 'Dr.', 'Zimbardo', 'now', 'most', 'interested', 'How', 'do', 'create', 'pro-social', 'individuals', 'once', 'relied', 'churches', 'synagogues', 'schools', 'have', 'less', 'influence', 'now', 'find', 'Dr.', 'Z', 'website', 'not', 'difficult', 'please', 'contribute', 'cause', 'research', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'government', 'funded', 'However', 'research', 'needed', 'now', 'more', 'ever', 'know', 'Soviets', 'advanced', 'only', 'rifles', 'machine', 'guns', 'aimed', 'backs', 'Heroes', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'Where', 'are', 'defenders', 'freedom', 'need', 'know', 'now', 'compulsory', 'service', '18', '24', 'year', 'olds', 'Time', 'short', 'Hitler', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'adults', 'thought', 'had', 'children', 'were', 'difficult', 'impossible', 'break', 'Nazi', 'mold', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'research', 'been', 'places', 'where', 'was', 'attempted', 'are', 'desperate', 'times', 'No', ""'m"", 'not', 'crackpot', 'conspiracy', 'theorist', 'say', 'based', 'well-done', 'research', 'research', 'be', 'done', 'None', 'Zimbardo', 'prisoners', 'became', 'partisans', 'Why', 'not', 'A', 'great', 'film', 'time']",N/A

952797,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000BYA5G4,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[1, 1]","This movie surfaces the subject of illegal arms dealing. Yuri Orlov, played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage, finds his one true talent and with the assistance of his brother he sets out to purchase and sell weapons of all sorts.From the depth of Ukraine immigrant status, Yuri Orlov reaches the top of his trade, supplying weapons to anyone and everyone interested in making a deal.The movie is simply amazing. The cynicism of the dialogue leaves us pondering on, as Mr. Orlov says, the fact that a decent, honest job is done by too many people, with very thin margins, and yet, there are large fortunes to be made selling every kind of weapons he can get his amoral hands on.Since childhood, Mr. Orlov has been in love with a beautiful model and wherever he travels, as he sees the tabloids displaying her image, he focuses in someday possessing this ""trophy wife"" played by Bridget Moynahan.At first, she is unaware of what he does for a living, and he convinces her that he is a millionaire in his own right, even though he has rented the plane he uses to take her away from a hotel where he had lured her under the disguise of photo opportunity.Orlov's brother, played by Jared Leto, helps him to achieve his goals, but he is disturbed about the consequences of the trade they are in. As he sees countless victims die under the fire of the very weapons they sell, he finds refuge in his cocaine drug addiction, to mask the fact that he is an accomplice.Yuri's cynicism is brilliantly played by Nicholas Cage, as he traffics in the death of thousands, the way other salesman might push vitamins or something good for humanity.Some of the very cynical statements are left for the audience to ponder on the fact that ""automobiles, alcohol and tobacco kill more people than weapons of all sorts.""Yuri Orlov travels all over the world, visiting a ruthless Liberian dictator, played by Eamonn Walker, who acquires weapons to eliminate any citizen who opposes his oppressive regime. The son is riveted in obtaining Rambo's weapon and even this, Yuri Orlov is able to acquire for him.In the end... when Yuri is put in jail, as he discusses his life with the man who has been after him throughout the film, he says... ""My parents disowned me, my wife and child have left me... members of my family are dead... yes... I understand my situation."" The reply is priceless... for the persecutor says... ""I would send you to hell, but you already live there!""While incredible dark humor is at play with this movie, I would highly recommend this film, for it surfaces the dangers of the arms race, and the high price we pay as nations continue to build arsenals of destruction.",5,Nicolas Cage at his best,1178064000,"05 2, 2007",2007,2661,"['movie', 'subject', 'illegal', 'arms', 'dealing', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'one', 'true', 'talent', 'assistance', 'brother', 'out', 'purchase', 'sell', 'weapons', 'sorts.From', 'depth', 'Ukraine', 'immigrant', 'status', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'top', 'trade', 'supplying', 'weapons', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'interested', 'making', 'deal.The', 'movie', 'simply', 'amazing', 'cynicism', 'dialogue', 'pondering', 'Mr.', 'Orlov', 'fact', 'decent', 'honest', 'job', 'done', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'very', 'thin', 'margins', 'yet', 'are', 'large', 'fortunes', 'be', 'made', 'selling', 'kind', 'weapons', 'can', 'get', 'amoral', 'hands', 'on.Since', 'childhood', 'Mr.', 'Orlov', 'been', 'love', 'beautiful', 'model', 'wherever', 'tabloids', 'displaying', 'image', 'someday', 'possessing', 'trophy', 'wife', 'played', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan.At', 'first', 'unaware', 'what', 'living', 'millionaire', 'own', 'right', 'even', 'rented', 'plane', 'take', 'away', 'hotel', 'where', 'had', 'lured', 'disguise', 'photo', 'opportunity.Orlov', 'brother', 'played', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'achieve', 'goals', 'disturbed', 'consequences', 'trade', 'are', 'countless', 'victims', 'die', 'fire', 'very', 'weapons', 'sell', 'refuge', 'cocaine', 'drug', 'addiction', 'mask', 'fact', 'accomplice.Yuri', 'cynicism', 'brilliantly', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'death', 'thousands', 'way', 'other', 'salesman', 'might', 'push', 'vitamins', 'something', 'good', 'humanity.Some', 'very', 'cynical', 'statements', 'are', 'left', 'audience', 'ponder', 'fact', 'automobiles', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'kill', 'more', 'people', 'weapons', 'sorts', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'world', 'visiting', 'ruthless', 'Liberian', 'dictator', 'played', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'who', 'weapons', 'eliminate', 'citizen', 'who', 'oppressive', 'regime', 'son', 'riveted', 'obtaining', 'Rambo', 'weapon', 'even', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'able', 'acquire', 'him.In', 'end', 'when', 'Yuri', 'put', 'jail', 'life', 'man', 'who', 'been', 'film', 'parents', 'disowned', 'wife', 'child', 'have', 'left', 'members', 'family', 'are', 'dead', 'yes', 'understand', 'situation', 'reply', 'priceless', 'persecutor', 'would', 'send', 'hell', 'already', 'live', 'there', 'incredible', 'dark', 'humor', 'play', 'movie', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'dangers', 'arms', 'race', 'high', 'price', 'pay', 'nations', 'continue', 'build', 'arsenals', 'destruction']",N/A

Yeah, there are a lot of similarities between ""Lord of War"" and ""Blow"", both plot-wise and in the style of the films.""Lord of War"" tells the story of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian-American arms dealer, who brags about having sold guns to every army on Earth except for the Salvation Army. Although Orlov is a fictional character, the script is based on actual events and is so well researched that it is completely believable to the point of being scary. Orlov is a completely immoral character who is unashamed of what he is doing and the idea that people like him could actually exist is genuinely frightening.From an entertainment point of view, ""Lord of War"" is not a fun film. The first half of the film, which details the rise of Yuri Orlov and his arms deals in assorted Eastern European countries is enjoyable enough, but I found the second half, in which Orlov moves into the war-ravaged African countries, to be depressing. The film is redeemed by an ending which I liked very much, but because of the scenes set in Africa, I probably won't be watching this film again in a hurry.Nevertheless, Nicolas Cage is excellent in this film. Initially, I felt that he was just playing the same character that he has played in every other film, but Cage's portrayal of Orlov as a man whose soul has been totally destroyed by his actions, at the end of the film, is still haunting me as I write this.

He does a great job playing the arms smuggler during the early 90s rising to power largely due to his connections back in his home country the Ukraine and a ruthless streak to not care who the guns are sold to.Some may say this film is too over political and moralistic I would say not.  It simply describes how arms smugglers get so rich off the misery of others.  Most people I am sure know well about the illegal diamond trade that took place during some of the most bloody conflicts in West Africa and the Westerners (and Lebanese for that matter) who profited from it.  The mercenaries who were former members of the apartheid South African army hired and paid in diamonds to fight dirty wars in Africa for tin pot dictators.The film begins with Cages life in a poor area of New York.  Faking a Jewish identity to escape from communist Russia his family make a modest living but Cage seeking a way out makes a few connections and gets himself into the arms trade.  Soon the Soviet Union collapses and he reacquaints himself with an old relative who just happens to be high up in the old army and business goes from there.Soon he becomes one of the major shipper of illegal arms to Liberia profiting on the misery of years of conflict.This is a great film to watch, its not too heavy on the politics and has enough little sub plots to keep you occupied.Great film recommended.",4,Very good film,1183852800,"07 8, 2007",2007,1516,"['Cage', 'one', 'actors', 'either', 'love', 'hate', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'convincing', 'think', 'positive', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'arms', 'smuggler', 'early', '90s', 'rising', 'power', 'largely', 'due', 'connections', 'back', 'home', 'country', 'Ukraine', 'ruthless', 'streak', 'not', 'care', 'who', 'guns', 'are', 'sold', 'to.Some', 'may', 'say', 'film', 'too', 'over', 'political', 'moralistic', 'would', 'say', 'not', 'simply', 'how', 'arms', 'smugglers', 'get', 'so', 'rich', 'misery', 'others', 'Most', 'people', 'am', 'sure', 'know', 'well', 'illegal', 'diamond', 'trade', 'took', 'place', 'most', 'bloody', 'conflicts', 'West', 'Africa', 'Westerners', 'Lebanese', 'matter', 'who', 'profited', 'mercenaries', 'who', 'were', 'former', 'members', 'apartheid', 'South', 'African', 'army', 'hired', 'paid', 'diamonds', 'fight', 'dirty', 'wars', 'Africa', 'tin', 'pot', 'dictators.The', 'film', 'Cages', 'life', 'poor', 'area', 'New', 'York', 'Faking', 'Jewish', 'identity', 'escape', 'communist', 'Russia', 'family', 'make', 'modest', 'living', 'Cage', 'seeking', 'way', 'out', 'few', 'connections', 'arms', 'trade', 'Soon', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'old', 'relative', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'high', 'old', 'army', 'business', 'there.Soon', 'one', 'major', 'shipper', 'illegal', 'arms', 'Liberia', 'profiting', 'misery', 'years', 'conflict.This', 'great', 'film', 'watch', 'not', 'too', 'heavy', 'politics', 'enough', 'little', 'sub', 'plots', 'keep', 'occupied.Great', 'film', 'recommended']",N/A
952803,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000BYA5G4,Grady Harp,"[2, 2]","Director/writer Andrew Niccol makes films with layers of meaning, the kind that find us laughing at inappropriate moments because contemporary life is like that: what on the surface seems like an entertaining story has very dark roots.  His previous strange films include 'The Terminal', 'The Truman Show', and 'Gattaca' and now LORD OF WAR  takes its place in that arena of black comedy.  Niccol really releases his last spear when at the end of the film there is a statement 'Based on Actual Facts' and at that point the film takes on an altogether new significance.Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost.  Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner.  The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world.  He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries.  He is tracked/stalked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detox.  Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence.  His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law.  The resolution of the  story is not an end but merely a tapering off.The film is narrated by Yuri and for the first part sounds almost comedic - until the visual depiction of the killings are on screen.  Niccol appears to be showing us a factual business that is legal in the eyes of the government ('Washington encourages gunrunners to take care of aspects of world control they can't be seen as condoning') and it is his gift to drive his message home about how human lives are wasted for the sake of business and weapons proliferation.  The film is painful to absorb on this level.Nicholas Cage gives a powerful performance as the opportunistic Yuri and the criminally under-used Jared Leto once again proves his fine-honed acting skills as the drugged addled innocent Vitaly. Likewise Bridget Moynahan is excellent as the wife who elects not to question her source of wealth.  Key cameos are keenly provided by Ian Holms and Eaamonn Walker.  The film is rapid-fire paced, the cinematography is excellent, and the impact of the film is powerful.  It is unusual for  a director to take on topics this controversial and end up with a film this entertaining.  Recommended.

If you don't like the deals from the former Soviet Union's stockpile of arsenal, you may be interested in a huge lot of discontinued assault rifles. How about unused guns and ammo from the U.S.-led aid to the Bosnian War? If you stick a gun in his face, he'll bring the price way down.""Lord Of War"" is a cynical, yet not heartless and probably accurate portrayal of an American 'secondary market' international weapons dealer. Yuri globe-trots the world scooping up fantastic deals on abandoned and obsolete weaponry and peddles it off to third world countries where demand for blooldshed is high. His biggest competitor, he likes to joke, is The President of The United States.So you get a heavy dose of good-humored anti-war subtleties, with a highly entertaining movie thrown in for good measure. The first person narrative, sometimes spoken directly into the camera, offers an endless stream of topical one-liners. Some work, and some don't - ""Buying your first gun is like making love for the first time. You don't know what you're doing, but you know you're having fun."" - or something to that effect. You eventually come away with a crash course in international arms dealing, that all the Time magazine issues in the world couldn't offer, sure to make you a more politically conscious observer. Exposure to the horrific results of weaponry in such an entertaining fashion is harsh, humane and like an unexpected needle from a doctor.Like a confident puppateer above the chaotic gunsmoke of war, Nicolas Cage reveals a believable and likable global arms dealer, who could be the same guy you saw selling a hot car radio in an ally. His scenes selling guns are nerve-bending as he makes bold physical and vocal gestures never riling dangerous warlords, while the slightest nervous tick could set off a slaughter. Bridget Moynahan's 'trophy wife' is anything but, an honest and touching portrayal of a rather superficial person coming to terms with her husband's means to wealth. I loved what she said about her failed careers and her stand against Yuri's profession, - ""I have been a failed artist and a failed actress. I will not be a failed human being."" Eamonn Walker as Liberian dictator Andre Baptiste delivers a suave and vicious characterization as a man who will 'test drive' a new assault rifle by killing someone in the room with it.I went into this film mistakenly thinking it was the upcoming film, ""Jarhead"". I saw previews for both and confused the titles. A little troubled by my mistake, it was as if someone pointed a gun to my forehead and said, ""watch this film instead."" I'm sold.

952808,A2HFL26OQJ2T9X,B000BYA5G4,H. Jin,"[1, 1]","`Lord of War' is a jet-black satire that follows the rise and rise of Yuri (Nicolas Cage), a Ukranian-American who eventually becomes one of the world's leading arms dealers.  In cynical fashion, Yuri narrates his life story, demonstrating how he succeeded in the arms trade through a combination of ruthless ambition and complete indifference to the motives of his clients.  We follow his relationships with his drug-addicted brother Vitaly and his model wife Ava, his cosying up to a brutal African dictator, and his pursuit by incorruptible Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).This is certainly one black comedy. Warfare and arms dealing are hardly light-hearted subjects, but the film is able to find humour in the darkest situations. Cage's droll, cynical narration and a tight, fast-paced script succeed in portraying the often absurd nature of global politics and international trade. The satirical nature of the film is balanced out by more serious scenes portraying the pointless violence and brutality in West Africa, particularly during the second half of the film.  Think `Blood Diamond' crossed with `Thank You For Smoking' and you'll get some idea of the tone of `Lord Of War'.The characterisation is a bit of a mixed bag, but the cast do a good job in their roles. Nicolas Cage has done this stream-of-consciousness navel gazing many times before (`Bringing Out The Dead', `Adaptation', `Weather Man') so if you liked him in any of those films you'll appreciate his performance here. Ethan Hawke gets the balance perfect as the incorruptible Valentine, making him principled without being nave. I also really liked the character of Weisz, the supposedly ""principled"" arms dealer who only sells to those whose cause he supports. But Jared Leto and Bridget Moynahan are saddled with mediocre characters. Vitaly serves no real purpose at all except to be ""messed up"" and cause trouble for Yuri. And Ava isn't particularly sympathetic despite her plight; she seemed perfectly happy to play the doormat trophy wife and live off the back of Yuri's ill-gotten gains, only to come over all moral and principled late in the film.While I personally quite liked the film, I do have a couple of problems with it:Firstly, there is no real development of Yuri's character at all, despite everything that happens to him in the film. For something that's supposed to be a character study, it's frustrating that there's not even a hint of either redemption or come-uppance.Secondly, there is a fair amount of predictable Hollywood moralising, such as equating the Florida recount (have they still not gotten over that yet?) with brutal African dictatorships, plus the inevitable claim that it's the US and its allies who are really the bad guys.  Undoubtedly there's some truth here, but the heavy-handed nature of the preaching feels clunky and forced given the satirical nature of the rest of the film.These drawbacks prevent `Lord of War' from being a truly great film, but it is still a very good one.

Like Most Nic Cage films I thought this one was going to be action-packed and fast paced think almost like (Gone in 30 Seconds and Next kinda), well I mean don't get me wrong by the title of the movie was ""Lord Of War"" and the poster with the guy behind Nic holding a gun makes it look like an action movie, it definitely didn't look Sci/Fi or Comedy so I supposed maybe it was action... I was wrong ! Why I don't care ? Because this movie despite it being different from most Cage films was surprisingly wonderful ! Don't you just love it when you find a pleasant surprise ? This movie was more than just a story, it was based on true events and an outlook on Humanity and morality.The movie is told from a weapon dealer's POV Yuri Orlov (Nic Cage) and his experience with dealing illegal weapons and selling them to foreign troops, governments etc.... Apparently this illegal exportation and importation of weapons (mostly guns and rifles to be used in wars etc...) has gained Yuri millions of dollars but in exchange ripped him off his mortality, humanity, family and most importantly his soul.This movie was interesting to watch, I knew very little about this subject of weapon dealing but I think I actually gained some knowledge from watching this. Of course, Yuri doesn't go on sealing weapons and wandering freely he is being pursued by the legal authorities who are trying to find him guilty and almost succeed till the last moment. Then you've got his social life which consist of his relationship with his Ukrainian parents, wife and child and his younger brother who is played by (Jared Leto). However, mostly this film focuses on Yuri's illegal activities.The casting choice I thought were very good, the acting was excellent too. The setting/customs etc....

952811,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000BYA5G4,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[3, 16]","An interesting film on arms trafficking, but too pedagogical in many ways. It tries to prove too much and it misses the real point.The real point is not the horror of these tribal or neighborly wars.The point is not the corruption of all the little warlords in Africa and other areas in the world.The point is not the domination of arms trafficking by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.The point is not even the rottenness of the politicians of western countries, of developed and emerging countries.The point is the hyena that lives in the human heart. The idea sure is present in the film, but not shown the way it should be shown.There is no escape from this basic idea that the human being is a predator against his own species, hence a cannibalistic predator, one of the very rare animal species that has this characteristic. Somewhere this film tries to save the human side of that predator.There is no saving of that human side because there is no human side. The human side is nothing but an illusion projected by hypocrites to hide their tracks and footprints. That's what the film should have shown in the most realistic way. Unluckily it did not dare. It tried to save humanity and show it is manipulated by the few predators that would be living in our midst.But these are not a few. As soon as a human being, especially in a group, a band, a gang, or whatever collective structure or party (all meanings of this word intended), has a little piece of power, that human being is going to turn predator. The trade-unionists in a strike will kidnap and keep hostages the engineers or managers of their business. The minority students will block their universities to force classes out and they will speak of a strike and pretend their diplomas and degrees must not be retained from them as a payment for their strike just like a worker loses a day's pay for one day's strike.Professors or students will sell university diplomas to foreign students (maybe to French ones too) to make their week-ends comfortable. A cop will release the evidence of still not yet tried case to hurt who knows who and the public will not see the denial of the rights of the defense but plain information for the public to know. A bunch of hooligans will kill someone in public and in front of a camera just out of rage, when it is not a five year old boy who kills a five year old girl at school or some individual who starts shooting in a school, on a campus, in an underground station, a supermarket or the street, not to speak of terrorist attacks and suicide bombers. There is no end to that horrible human nature. Sainthood, saint-dom or saint-ness not to speak of sanctity do not exist on earth.Maybe in heaven but after death only. In this film it is more or less asserted that some cops are honest though impotent, that some people hate violence, crime and guns, that some people may prefer poverty in purity rather than wealth in blindfolded innocence. I do not believe it. There is no right side in no conflict. The working class is in no way better than the capitalists. If they get power they turn terroristic, they open and manage some gulag, or whatever procedure to eliminate the other side.There is no guarantee that any one human being could be in any one way innocent.

I won't discuss its merits as movie.Its clear BD offers more than 1080i or 720p, and it shows if you want the best video and audio visible on a big screen TV.Video is noticeably sharper and the sound, particularly the explosions and other arms fire, pop out and are more distinct in BD.  There is far more dynamic range and channel separation.  Its very difficult to describe a visual, but the colors are noticeably more vibrant and the edges of images  a touch sharper than even 1080i.For example, the opening scene of LOW shows the manufacture of bullets.  In the DVD version, a viewer didn't notice it was all CGI.  In 720p is looks CGI, in BD, its very noticeably CGI.  So what looks like a great 'realistic' effect now becomes a cartoon like opening sequence.The BD I received was made in 2006 or 07; it was one of the first BD releases.

This seems to be a movie with an educational and ethical mission about the international situation in arms dealing. It includes the fall of the Soviet Union to conflicts in Africa.

Cage aquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who uses selective denial, and Ethan Hawk represents the law that is always on his tail. Eamonn Walker does a great job as Andre Baptiste - leader of an African nation who plays Cage's main customers. Walker is great at playing a bad guy.

Certainly, I had never heard of it. With an R rating and plenty of graphic violence not to mention drug use, this is definitely a film for mature audiences.Having said all that, I think this is an excellent film. Unlike many recent examples of Nic Cage pulling down a paycheck, he is both less likable and more believable here. While simultaneously glorifying and dehumanizing Cage's Yuri Orlov, director Andrew Niccol presents a reality where a long line of willing successors is ready to take his place. The world needs guns like it does food or water.This isn't another Bruckheimer/Bay pyrotechnics orgy. While explosions have not been completely excised, Lord of War is actually closer to Oscar-darling Blood Diamond, released over a year later. The latter cost twice as much to make. To be fair, it also earned more than twice as much in revenue.I am not always a proponent of voiceovers, but at least it is consistent in timbre and frequency here. Bridget Moynahan is stunning, Jared Leto is very good as the black sheep brother, however I feel the Interpol agent could have been played by someone with less star power than Ethan Hawke, who for some reason was channeling Peter Berg.The film's opening (the life cycle of a round of ammunition) sets the tone. My other favorite scene is the stripped Antonov An-12. (No spoilers here; see--and enjoy--for yourself.)NOTE:Director Andrew Niccol was said to have purchased real AK-47s for filming because they were cheaper than prop guns. That may be so, at least in the former Eastern Bloc Czech Republic where filming took place, but Niccol is laboring under the misconception that reducing access to firearms will reduce crime in the real world.

In the film, Lord of War, Nicolas Cage, plays Yuri Orlov, who's weapons, allow the process of death and mass murder to become an art form. The film is unapologetic and quite brutal as are the actors who portray the various waring dictators, soldiers and merchants of death participating in the gun-trade. Following his transformation from drug pusher to arms dealer, Yuri displays a genius for circumventing international law and becomes an expert at delivering death to any infant nation struggling for survival around the world. Chased by a persistent Federal agent from the U.S., as well as inter-pol agents, the film is set to the background of various conflicts around the globe. The film is a social statement which reminds us, there are many nations who's leaders would rather prostitute their country's resources and the lives of their people, than establish a future for them.

This is true: his performance is good, but his above average acting (above his average) does not offset a highly flawed picture.1. STORYLINE - Not bad at all, but at times it is absolutely absurd and really has to beg the viewer to take it seriously. Interpol apparently can just zip into whatever country they please and make arrests. Yuri's brother's coke addiction is a worthless sub-story that could have been left out. However, the overall depiction of the violence in West Africa is pretty realistic, right down to the crazed gunmen and Cowboy cheerleader outfits.2. MESSAGE - far from ambiguious. The general message is guns = violence. Just ignore it, because its not well argued anyway.3. ACTING - unfortunately, the acting cannot be ignored. Cage is not a great actor, but he isn't bad in this. The actor who plays his brother is awful - evidently, they just needed a stock pretty boy actor. Ethan Hawke plays a blowhard tough Interpol cop, a role in which he is not very convincing. The Liberian warlord Baptiste is perhaps the most interesting role and most admirably performed.4. WRITING - my biggest beef, and my biggest beef with most movies. The dialog is terrible, chock full of cheesy one-liners and metaphors about arms dealing.

In retrospect, it's like a guns version of the Johnny Depp movie ""Blow.""Actually in more ways than one. Both films are about men who begin working in illegal businesses while making vast sums of money and watching their dream come true; And then watch their lives crumble around them with time. Also both films received good reviews and featured Oscar worthy performances and scripts but were ignored by the Academy. Nicolas Cage takes a break from playing his loser character (Matchstick Men, The Weather Man, etc.) and instead plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian man who was raised in Brooklyn. Yuri realizes one day that doing what he's been doing isn't working for him, so with the help of his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, 'Requiem for a Dream') he becomes a private gunrunner delivering to people in places like Sierra Leone, Russia, and Liberia. Meanwhile, Yuri also marries his dream girl Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan, who looks completely different then she did in the movies 'The Recruit' and 'I, Robot') and has a son. The movie says at the end ""Based on Real Events,"" which means nothing...I doubt that a man named Yuri Orlov existed but that doesn't make this film any more or less interesting. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol paints a near perfect portrait of a troubled, yet brilliant man who's trying to support his family and make money no matter who or what he risks. This is one of Nicolas Cage's best performances since ""Leaving Las Vegas."" Both Eathan Hawke (That dude who was married to Uma Thurman) and Ian Holm ('From Hell') deliver good supporting work; Especially Hawke who plays an Interpol agent chasing Yuri for years and never truly getting what he wants. The movie presents a great message, something young viewers won't notice sadly enough. This is not only one of the most morally terrific movies of 2005, but it was also one of the best and most overlooked.

952833,A27CHILBK6HIL2,B000BYA5G4,Kaya Savas,"[4, 11]","MOVIE: Ever wonder what reading a script is like? Well, with Lord Of War it becomes a first hand experience.  Lord Of War is a film about a guy who is one of the hottest arms dealers around. Yuri (Cage) tries to find his calling in life, and he stumbles into international arms dealing.  What the entire movie basically talks about is if it's moral, and when I say ""talk"" I do mean it.  The entire movie is narrated by Nic Cage's character, every thought and every action. Each scene is layed out by narration and then wrapped up with narration. It gets to a point where you feel like yelling at the writer and tell him ""to shut that goddamn inner monologue off"". What seperates a film from a book is that the action is performed in a film rather than described. People call this film an ""action/adventure"", but I find no justification for this to be placed in that genre. The only thing this movie has going for it is that there are some interesting ideas being thrown around. Unfortunetly all those ideas don't make an impact because the audience becomes so bored with the film. In terms of cinematic achievments, there are a few well done scenes.  A scene involving Nicolas Cage and Ian Holm was pretty tense, and so is a scene that shows Nicolas Cage going through some hallucinations. The opening credits were  brilliant in my opinion, but then again I couldn't wait to see the closing credits.  The relationship between Cage and his wife was also pretty bad. Basically she married Yuri for the money, and then she gets angry with him when she finds out what he actually does and that he had been decieving her. Talk about true love. The movie never finds its direction, and that makes the audience suffer for two hours. It had some nifty camera work and cinematography, but the satirical points the movie was trying to make was lost due to poor pacing and no direction within the plot.ACTING: Nothing stellar, we've all seen what these actors can do and they don't do much more than that here.BOTTOM LINE: Not very enjoyable, you may get a chuckle or a smile from a witty line a few times throughout, but all the 3rd person narration will bore you to tears.",2,Interesting Ideas Lost Amidst The Constant & Boring Narration,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,2163,"['MOVIE', 'Ever', 'wonder', 'what', 'reading', 'script', 'Well', 'Lord', 'War', 'first', 'hand', 'experience', 'Lord', 'War', 'film', 'guy', 'who', 'one', 'hottest', 'arms', 'dealers', 'around', 'Yuri', 'Cage', 'find', 'calling', 'life', 'international', 'arms', 'dealing', 'What', 'entire', 'movie', 'basically', 'talks', 'moral', 'when', 'say', 'talk', 'do', 'mean', 'entire', 'movie', 'narrated', 'Nic', 'Cage', 'character', 'thought', 'action', 'scene', 'layed', 'out', 'narration', 'then', 'wrapped', 'up', 'narration', 'point', 'where', 'feel', 'yelling', 'writer', 'tell', 'shut', 'goddamn', 'inner', 'monologue', 'What', 'film', 'book', 'action', 'performed', 'film', 'rather', 'described', 'People', 'call', 'film', 'action/adventure', 'find', 'justification', 'be', 'placed', 'genre', 'only', 'thing', 'movie', 'going', 'are', 'interesting', 'ideas', 'being', 'thrown', 'Unfortunetly', 'ideas', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'impact', 'audience', 'so', 'bored', 'film', 'terms', 'cinematic', 'achievments', 'are', 'few', 'well', 'done', 'scenes', 'scene', 'involving', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'was', 'pretty', 'tense', 'so', 'scene', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'going', 'hallucinations', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'brilliant', 'opinion', 'then', 'again', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'closing', 'credits', 'relationship', 'Cage', 'wife', 'was', 'also', 'pretty', 'bad', 'Basically', 'married', 'Yuri', 'money', 'then', 'angry', 'when', 'out', 'what', 'actually', 'had', 'been', 'decieving', 'Talk', 'true', 'love', 'movie', 'never', 'direction', 'audience', 'suffer', 'two', 'hours', 'had', 'nifty', 'camera', 'work', 'cinematography', 'satirical', 'points', 'movie', 'was', 'trying', 'make', 'was', 'lost', 'due', 'poor', 'pacing', 'direction', 'plot.ACTING', 'Nothing', 'stellar', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'what', 'actors', 'can', 'do', 'do', ""n't"", 'do', 'much', 'more', 'here.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'Not', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'may', 'get', 'chuckle', 'smile', 'witty', 'line', 'few', 'times', '3rd', 'person', 'narration', 'will', 'bore', 'tears']",N/A

952835,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000BYA5G4,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[2, 3]","There is one scene in Lord of War where Nicolas Cage's character leans over a statue of Lenin counting his profits on a calculator, which symbolically provides a strong notion of how a nation has failed its people.  However, the notion should not only be applied to the former Soviet Union, since as the film unfolds it is obvious that the corruption exists in all nations of the world.  This suggests that numerous nations in the world have failed their people.  Lord of War focuses on the arms dealers and the corruption and deception that trail this spineless profession, as they sell weapons to all of those who can pay regardless of human lives.Empty shells in the millions lay on the ground spread out around Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), which means business is booming for a stone cold arms dealer.  Yuri's expensive suit bears proof in his success dealing in arms trade and that he never gets involved wherever the weapons are sold.  Consequently, he provides the audience with staggering facts that there is one firearm per 12 people in the world to which he comments on how he could arm the other eleven.A jump cut brings the viewer to the manufacturing of a bullet from the stage of being a sheet of metal to when it is fired and enters the head of a child.  The child who is shot is also firing a machinegun.  It is a powerful message displaying the impersonal machinery of making weapons, but it also shows how penetrating personal each bullet is when they hit an intended targets.Through a large amount of voice-over the audience learns the story of Yuri.  It is a told in an authentic manner, according to Yuri, as he begins with informing the audience about how he got started selling weapons.  It is clear that he began for the same reasons many try to make a better living for themselves while dreaming of a better life.  Besides this he tells us about the importance of the environment, and how it affected his choice to go into arms dealing.The story stretches over a 20-year period, as he makes deals with anyone interested in buying weapons.  It covers drug lords, warlords, freedom fighters, terrorists, dictators, and nations trying to get their hands on weapons otherwise not accessible.  Some of these characters affect Yuri's life in a negative manner, but he ignores the bad aspects of the business, as he is good at it.  Yuri also does not care to whom he sells his weapons, as long as the paycheck comes through.  He even informs the audience that he does not make business with Osama Bin Laden, as his checks bounce.It might seem a little morbid, but the film also effectively applies a heavy dose of irony in order to show the two sides of the story.  The irony also works well to Yuri's comments, as he rationalizes why he is in the business of selling firearms.  After all, the only true winners of wars are the arms salesmen.Initially, it feels a little frustrating with the large amount of voice-over, however, as the story unfolds the voice-over enhances the authentic atmosphere, as if Yuri really was telling his life story.  The camera functions much like an extension to Yuri's voice-over that helps fill in the details of his dirty job.  In addition, the cinematography occasionally augments the visual imagery through excellent scene framing that brings out an artistic side of the dark world of arms deals.  The visual aesthetics and powerful issue in the film brings together a genuinely intriguing cinematic experience that keeps the audience thinking while being entertained on a high level.",4,Captivating Film of the True Nature of Arms Dealers Spineless Profession...,1138492800,"01 29, 2006",2006,3536,"['one', 'scene', 'Lord', 'War', 'where', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'character', 'over', 'statue', 'Lenin', 'counting', 'profits', 'calculator', 'symbolically', 'strong', 'notion', 'how', 'nation', 'failed', 'people', 'However', 'notion', 'should', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'applied', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'film', 'obvious', 'corruption', 'nations', 'world', 'numerous', 'nations', 'world', 'have', 'failed', 'people', 'Lord', 'War', 'focuses', 'arms', 'dealers', 'corruption', 'deception', 'trail', 'spineless', 'profession', 'sell', 'weapons', 'who', 'can', 'pay', 'regardless', 'human', 'lives.Empty', 'shells', 'millions', 'lay', 'ground', 'spread', 'out', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'business', 'booming', 'stone', 'cold', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Yuri', 'expensive', 'suit', 'proof', 'success', 'dealing', 'arms', 'trade', 'never', 'involved', 'weapons', 'are', 'sold', 'Consequently', 'audience', 'staggering', 'facts', 'one', 'firearm', '12', 'people', 'world', 'comments', 'how', 'could', 'arm', 'other', 'eleven.A', 'jump', 'cut', 'viewer', 'manufacturing', 'bullet', 'stage', 'being', 'sheet', 'metal', 'when', 'fired', 'head', 'child', 'child', 'who', 'shot', 'also', 'firing', 'machinegun', 'powerful', 'message', 'displaying', 'impersonal', 'machinery', 'making', 'weapons', 'also', 'how', 'penetrating', 'personal', 'bullet', 'when', 'hit', 'intended', 'large', 'amount', 'voice-over', 'audience', 'story', 'Yuri', 'told', 'authentic', 'manner', 'according', 'Yuri', 'informing', 'audience', 'how', 'got', 'started', 'selling', 'weapons', 'clear', 'began', 'same', 'reasons', 'many', 'try', 'make', 'better', 'living', 'dreaming', 'better', 'life', 'importance', 'environment', 'how', 'affected', 'choice', 'go', 'arms', 'dealing.The', 'story', 'stretches', '20-year', 'period', 'deals', 'anyone', 'interested', 'buying', 'weapons', 'drug', 'lords', 'warlords', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'terrorists', 'dictators', 'nations', 'trying', 'get', 'hands', 'weapons', 'otherwise', 'not', 'accessible', 'characters', 'affect', 'Yuri', 'life', 'negative', 'manner', 'bad', 'aspects', 'business', 'good', 'Yuri', 'also', 'not', 'care', 'whom', 'weapons', 'as', 'long', 'paycheck', 'even', 'audience', 'not', 'make', 'business', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'checks', 'bounce.It', 'might', 'seem', 'little', 'morbid', 'film', 'also', 'effectively', 'heavy', 'dose', 'irony', 'order', 'show', 'two', 'sides', 'story', 'irony', 'also', 'well', 'Yuri', 'comments', 'why', 'business', 'selling', 'firearms', 'only', 'true', 'winners', 'wars', 'are', 'arms', 'salesmen.Initially', 'little', 'frustrating', 'large', 'amount', 'voice-over', 'however', 'story', 'voice-over', 'authentic', 'atmosphere', 'Yuri', 'really', 'was', 'telling', 'life', 'story', 'camera', 'functions', 'much', 'extension', 'Yuri', 'voice-over', 'fill', 'details', 'dirty', 'job', 'addition', 'cinematography', 'occasionally', 'visual', 'imagery', 'excellent', 'scene', 'framing', 'out', 'artistic', 'side', 'dark', 'world', 'arms', 'deals', 'visual', 'aesthetics', 'powerful', 'issue', 'film', 'together', 'genuinely', 'intriguing', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'audience', 'thinking', 'being', 'entertained', 'high', 'level']",N/A

He has brilliant work like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Gatacca"" to his credit; even ""Simone"" which failed in its execution was at least a novel idea. So, when near-complete failure happens on all levels in a project by such a visionary we are shocked and rather unforgiving. While ""Lord of War has moments of inventiveness, the bulk of it could have been written or shot by any number of people.Critics in the press assert that the principal problem with ""Lord of War"" is that Yuri Orlav remains the same from beginning to end.  I contend that there are many films in which the bad guy stays bad and we still want to see him succeed because he is cunning and just so darn good at what he does. Orlav is good at what he does, and at his core he's just someone who is more than willing to take advantage of the cynical, corrupt, and apathetic world we live in.  In short, Yuri Orlav is the least of the film's problems.""Lord of War"" tries to be a black comedy and/or a satire. The problem is that Niccol is incapable of satire. He doesn't trust his audiences enough to let the absurd horrors in the film speak for themselves. Instead, we are treated to quips so dull and at times even corny that I expected ""Lord of War"" to be the first film set to a laugh track.The film hammers its already obvious points home by such astoundingly unsubtle means. For example, the scene in which each of the casings being expelled in slow motion from a machine-gun are made to sound like the ""cha-ching"" of a cash register. Sheesh! ""Lord of War"" fails as a film because not only is its main character unsympathetic and oftentimes deadpan and uninteresting, but also because it doesn't explore its heady themes in any real depth, opting instead for incredibly inept satire.

LOW tries to be balanced and not too preachy; the rationalizations actually make some sense. The film downplays the political connections more than is likely true, though, I'd guess (destabilization of third world countries is one of the CIA's favorite tactics, as revealed by many ex-agents in many books, as is the Agency's drug-dealing as a method of both ""insurgent"" funding and arms trading, as revealed in the Iran/Contra hearings).My main qualm is with Cage, who somehow always seems to invest his characters with less brains and savvy than they deserve.

952840,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000BYA5G4,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[2, 2]","""Lord of War"" begins by following a bullet from the moment it is manufactured to the point at which it is fired and kills somebody on the other side of the globe.  I think it is obvious that is what is going to be the payoff to the opening sequence, but I also think that you know the victim is going to be instantly recognizable as an innocent, because clearly selling arms is a bad thing.  But the point of this 2005 movie from writer-director Andrew Niccol is that selling arms is also big business.  How big he saves for the final punch line of the film, which makes sure nobody finishes watching ""Lord of War"" without getting the point.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian immigrant who discovers that his gift in this world is selling arms (a.k.a. ""gun running"").  He teams up with his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), until they are paid off one time with cocaine and a kilo is appropriated for personal use.  Pursuing Yuri is Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an American agent working with INTERPOL, whose Achilles heel is that he will not break the law, although you have to admire his interpretation of holding a suspect in custody for 24 hours before charging them.  Yuri always knows exactly where he stand vis-a-vis the law, but I must saw that he is perfectly polite when yanking Valentine's chain.  Yuri's own Achilles heel would be his wife, the former Ava Fontaine (Bridget Monyahan), a super model that he is able to wine and dine into becoming his wife.  She remains oblivious to what he does, but if Yuri has to choose between his wife and his work, you are inclined to think he would go with the latter.  After all, the fall of the Soviet Union and the arms bonanza that creates in the former republics is a lot more important to Yuri than the fact his son has started walking.However, there are two people who seem to pose a bigger threat to Yuri.  One is Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), the king of the arms dealers, who sells not for the money but to dictate the balance of power in the world by picking sides.  Yuri refuses to pick sides.  Yuri maintains he is oblivious to what the guns, grenades, tanks and other military hardware are ultimately used for by the people who buy them (the same cannot be said for Vitaly).  Weisz wants to squash Yuri, but whether it is for economic or ideological reasons is not clear.  The other threat is one of Yuri's biggest customers, Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker), the dictator of Liberia, who is crazy enough that he might blow Yuri away on a whim with a gun that has not been sold yet (or by sending him a couple of local women from a country that has one of the highest AIDS rates in the world).  Since the film focuses so much on Yuri's ride, you know that there is going to have to be a fall.  The question is, how far and how hard?Niccol wrote and directed ""S1mOne"" and ""Gattaca,"" and also wrote ""The Terminal"" and ""The Truman Show,"" so clearly there is always some important point to be made in his films. ""Lord of War"" is one that defines a problem without attempting to offer a solution.  Indeed, the punch line at the end of this one, which is reinforced by the facts related before the end titles, makes it clear no solution is possible.  Yuri's final words put a spin on what has transpired, but you have to think people in the audience are just focusing on the horror and the madness of it all.  Then again, Cage's performance makes you root for Yuri despite the fact that what he is doing is bad, which makes him a bad person.The evil of being a ""Lord of War"" is the overriding point of the film and that judgment is supposed to overcome some of the problems with the narrative.  Yuri does a lot of the work in the field by himself, which seems a tad dangerous to me, but I guess part of the attraction here is that he is glib enough to survive living on the razor's edge.  But I really do not understand why he wants his brother with him ever again once he clearly becomes a liability.  Again, it is Cage's performance that forgives a lot of these concerns and Niccol does have a payoff for the big set up.  The results are not great, but certainly well worth watching.",4,"Hey, somebody has to sell arms to the wackos of the world",1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,4144,"['Lord', 'War', 'following', 'bullet', 'moment', 'manufactured', 'point', 'fired', 'kills', 'somebody', 'other', 'side', 'globe', 'think', 'obvious', 'what', 'going', 'be', 'payoff', 'opening', 'sequence', 'also', 'think', 'know', 'victim', 'going', 'be', 'instantly', 'recognizable', 'innocent', 'clearly', 'selling', 'arms', 'bad', 'thing', 'point', '2005', 'movie', 'writer-director', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'selling', 'arms', 'also', 'big', 'business', 'How', 'big', 'final', 'punch', 'line', 'film', 'sure', 'nobody', 'watching', 'Lord', 'War', 'getting', 'point.Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'Ukrainian', 'immigrant', 'who', 'gift', 'world', 'selling', 'arms', 'a.k.a', 'gun', 'running', 'up', 'brother', 'Vitaly', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'are', 'paid', 'one', 'time', 'cocaine', 'kilo', 'appropriated', 'personal', 'use', 'Pursuing', 'Yuri', 'Jack', 'Valentine', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'American', 'agent', 'working', 'INTERPOL', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'will', 'not', 'break', 'law', 'have', 'admire', 'interpretation', 'holding', 'suspect', 'custody', '24', 'hours', 'charging', 'Yuri', 'always', 'exactly', 'where', 'stand', 'vis-a-vis', 'law', 'must', 'saw', 'perfectly', 'polite', 'when', 'yanking', 'Valentine', 'chain', 'Yuri', 'own', 'Achilles', 'heel', 'would', 'be', 'wife', 'former', 'Ava', 'Fontaine', 'Bridget', 'Monyahan', 'super', 'model', 'able', 'wine', 'dine', 'becoming', 'wife', 'oblivious', 'what', 'Yuri', 'choose', 'wife', 'work', 'are', 'inclined', 'think', 'would', 'go', 'latter', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'arms', 'bonanza', 'former', 'republics', 'lot', 'more', 'important', 'Yuri', 'fact', 'son', 'started', 'walking.However', 'are', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'pose', 'bigger', 'threat', 'Yuri', 'One', 'Simeon', 'Weisz', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'king', 'arms', 'dealers', 'who', 'not', 'money', 'dictate', 'balance', 'power', 'world', 'picking', 'sides', 'pick', 'sides', 'Yuri', 'oblivious', 'what', 'guns', 'grenades', 'tanks', 'other', 'military', 'hardware', 'are', 'ultimately', 'used', 'people', 'who', 'buy', 'same', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Vitaly', 'squash', 'Yuri', 'economic', 'ideological', 'reasons', 'not', 'clear', 'other', 'threat', 'one', 'Yuri', 'biggest', 'customers', 'Andre', 'Baptiste', 'Sr.', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'dictator', 'Liberia', 'who', 'crazy', 'enough', 'might', 'blow', 'Yuri', 'away', 'whim', 'gun', 'not', 'been', 'sold', 'yet', 'sending', 'couple', 'local', 'women', 'country', 'one', 'highest', 'AIDS', 'rates', 'world', 'film', 'so', 'much', 'Yuri', 'ride', 'know', 'going', 'have', 'be', 'fall', 'question', 'how', 'far', 'how', 'hard', 'Niccol', 'wrote', 'directed', 'S1mOne', 'Gattaca', 'also', 'wrote', 'Terminal', 'Truman', 'Show', 'so', 'clearly', 'always', 'important', 'point', 'be', 'made', 'films', 'Lord', 'War', 'one', 'problem', 'attempting', 'offer', 'solution', 'Indeed', 'punch', 'line', 'end', 'one', 'reinforced', 'facts', 'related', 'end', 'titles', 'clear', 'solution', 'possible', 'Yuri', 'final', 'words', 'put', 'spin', 'transpired', 'have', 'think', 'people', 'audience', 'are', 'just', 'focusing', 'horror', 'madness', 'Then', 'again', 'Cage', 'performance', 'root', 'Yuri', 'fact', 'what', 'doing', 'bad', 'bad', 'person.The', 'evil', 'being', 'Lord', 'War', 'overriding', 'point', 'film', 'judgment', 'supposed', 'overcome', 'problems', 'narrative', 'Yuri', 'lot', 'work', 'field', 'tad', 'dangerous', 'guess', 'part', 'attraction', 'here', 'glib', 'enough', 'survive', 'living', 'razor', 'edge', 'really', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'why', 'brother', 'ever', 'again', 'once', 'clearly', 'liability', 'Again', 'Cage', 'performance', 'lot', 'concerns', 'Niccol', 'have', 'payoff', 'big', 'set', 'up', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'great', 'certainly', 'well', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

The depiction of how Yuri gets into the arms business was weak:  he sees someone get shot at and decides that's his career in life?  Just like that?  Where does he get the money to start? His brother Vitaly.  I disagree with previous commenters that the brother goes into drugs because of what his brother does for a living.  He was boozing it up before Yuri got into the business.  I guess he's supposed to be the conscience for his brother and suffers for it, but his character just strikes me as shallow, before and after.  It's a political film that slams the US as a moral cretin for permitting people like Yuri to sell illegal arms (despite the heroic efforts of one particular Interpol Agent) to ruthless and cold blooded dictators, but if not the US and Yuri, then another country and its Yuri.

952847,A4SY5RCGC5CH9,B000BYA5G4,"Maciej ""Darth Maciek""","[0, 0]","I rather liked this partially based on facts thriller, even if I don't agree with some of its conclusions.  Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.This film tells the story of arms trafficker Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), son of Jewish immigrants from Soviet Union (more precisely Ukraine), but who grew in USA. Orlov and his broiher Vitaliy (Jared Leto) began their criminal career in early 80s and he initially illegally imported and sold small quantities of handguns and submachine guns to various mobsters. Later, from 1982 to 1989, brothers Orlov manage to make some more serious money by selling rifles and machine guns to various factions fighting during Lebanon Civil War, as well as to the Colombian drug cartels.Then comes the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and in Soviet Union and corrupt generals started to sell weaponry from the enormous arsenal of former Red Army. From that moment on Orlov brothers become real lords of illegal weapons trade and they make enormous profits &#8211; but they also attract attention of law enforcement agencies everywhere around the world&#8230;The film is pretty well done and the character of Yuri Orlov, which mixes intelligence, resourcefulness and  real courage with an absolutely nihilistic cynicism, is a really fascinating one. The scenario, the dialogs and especially the brilliant narration by Orlov himself, which includes many memorable one-liners, are really very enjoyable. It must be also said that the opening sequence is particularly strong.The one thing that I didn't like that much was the general message of the film and especially the conclusion. Makers of this film seemed to really believe that characters like Orlov, who provide any weapon they can put their hands on to anybody willing to pay the good price, are somehow in cahoots with industrial and military complex of western countries and therefore are protected by various states, beginning with United States. Well, the problem is, this is NOT true!The model for Yuri Orlov was a real life Russian arms trafficker, Viktor Anatolyevich Bout, born in 1967 in Dushanbe in what was then Tajik Soviet Republic. Bout indeed made a fortune in arms trafficking after 1991 and he indeed delivered huge amounts of ex-Soviet weaponry to various African guerrillas and armies, receiving in exchange frequently illegally mined diamonds (so called &#34;blood diamonds&#34;).Investigated by various western police agencies and intelligence agencies he was however difficult to stop, as he was for a long time protected by Russian secret services. Once this protection was lost he found refuge in Libya from where he safely continued his operations as he was out of reach of western countries. Ultimately however he had to leave Libya too, when Gadhafi decided to improve his relations with United States and from that moment he was all the time on the run.Arrested in Thailand in 2008 he was extradited to United States where he was found guilty of selling arms to Colombian guerrilla group FARC, which is considered a terrorist organisation by Washington. Sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2011, he is currently serving his sentence in an American federal prison.Other inspirations for Orlov character were:- Oleg Orlov, a Russian arms trafficker who sold illegally weapons to Iran, defying the embargo enforced by Russian authorities; Orlov was murdered by a fellow inmate when incarcerated in a prison in Kiev in 2007- Ukrainian mobster boss Semion Mogilevich, who as of 2014 is still living in hiding and is on the FBI 10 top wanted list- Lebanese-Armenian arm trafficker Sarkis Soghanalian, who served time in USA from 1992 to 1995, but who managed to shorten his sentence by providing intelligence to Americans about other arms traffickers and especially a huge counterfeiting operation mounted by Hezbollah terrorist organisation; expelled to France, Soghanalian was finally allowed to return to USA for health reason &#8211; he died in a hospital in Florida in 2011As we can plainly see, those four shady characters can hardly be seen as being in cahoots with western countries and especially it is hard to say that they were protected and immune from prosecution (even if one managed to escape a heavy sentence by ratting on competition&#8230;). Therefore the whole conclusion of the film is simply wrong and unfounded &#8211; and therefore I cannot honestly rate this film full five stars.That being said, it is a good, solid thriller about a very peculiar businessman &#8211; a cynical, ruthless death merchant&#8230; And it is pretty well done. A recommended viewing, even if the conclusion is mostly false. Enjoy!",4,"""There is one firearm for every twelve people on the planet.

In this movie we follow Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) from his early days in the early 1980s as an immigrant in New York to the present. One day when checking out menu of their family's competition across the street, he is witness to a Russian Mob assassination attempt. Of course the amount of ammo being used grabs Yuri's attention. For he thinks everyone needs bullets. And this is all he needs to try his hand at gun running.He starts off his business by being a reseller of Uzi's in New York and works his way up to arming countries. As Yuri deals his product, the repercussions of his sales are not glossed over. We see the havoc and death they bring. The sad part of the movie is what Yuri says is true; most of what he does is legal. Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet. The movie has the feel of reality to it.When you see the volumes of arms he sells and the death it brings. It makes a strong statement. But I think the bigger statement is the fact that the five largest arms dealers in the world are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council itself (U.S., China, France, Great Britain and France). And they continue to sell to whom ever will buy.Watch this movie. There are no spots in where you will be bored.

Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 4]","Lord of War stars Nicolas Cage as Yuri, a Russian immigrant who finds an unusual professional calling: he decides at an early age that he has what it takes to become an international arms dealer.  The film is ""based on a true story"" and the accompanying documentary on the DVD makes you believe that the director/writer Andrew Niccol did his homework.  Most of the weapons are cold-war leftovers that Yuri acquires from high-ranking former Soviet military officers looking for a little underhanded capitalism.Jared Leto is featured as Yuri's brother Vitaly and Bridget Moynahan is beautifully believable as Yuri's trophy bride Ava Fontaine.  Ian Holm is very effective as an ""old school"" arms dealer who first dismisses the upstart Yuri, then approaches him later seeking a partnership.  Eamonn Walker is chilling as the militaristic dictator of Liberia - a nation that was supposed to be founded as a home for descendents of former slaves, now turned into a perpetual high-stakes gang war.  Ethan Hawke shines in his scenes as the ""honest cop"", an Interpol agent who knows all of Yuri's underhanded dealings, but won't compromise his own integrity or bend the rules to bring Yuri to justice - a fact Yuri exploits more than once.It's not easy watching a film in which the lead character is such a scumbag outlaw, but Cage brings such an easy-going larger-than-life charm to Yuri that you're able to overlook his significant ""character flaw"" to get through the film.

952853,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,B000BYA5G4,Marshall Lord,"[3, 4]","One of the adverts at the start of the version of this DVD which I watched was placed by a campaign against the arms trade. The advert took the form of a spoof TV advert for weapons. It's difficult to see what the people who paid for this advert thought they were adding to what is already on the disc; essentially the film itself is a much longer and more sophisticated version of the same point.Nicolas Cage plays the central character and narrator Yuri Orlov, who was born in what is now the Ukraine and emigrated from the former Soviet Union with his parents. He becomes an international arms dealer. Obviously damaged inside by the human consequences of his trade, Orlov tries to deal with them by distancing himself from the actions of his customers and avoiding crimes other than gun-running. When a Columbian drug baron wants to pay him in cocaine rather than money, Orlov protests ""I'm am arms trader, not a drug dealer."" At one point one of his customers tries to ""reward"" Orlov by providing on a plate the opportunity to take revenge on a rival arms dealer who had murdered Yuri Orlov's uncle. Although he had been close to his uncle and upset by that murder Orlov does not want to pull the trigger himself to kill the man responsible even under duress.Cage is one of very few actors who could bring off the studied understatement and ironic black humour required of the central character and narrator to make this film work. You are never quite sure what exactly is going on inside Orlov's head. When he sees Gorbachov on TV announcing the end of the cold war, Yuri is so delighted that he barely hears his wife Eva (Bridget Moynahan) saying that their baby son is walking for the first time; but you are unclear whether he is so pleased because he cares about the country of his birth or because this will mean more opportunties for gun running.Most viewers will be clear that for all Orlov's wealth they would not want to change places with him: at one point Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who is the nearest thing the film has to a hero says to him ""I'd tell you to go to Hell - but I think you're already there.""Strong performance from a  number of other cast members. Jared Leto is Yuri's brother and sidekick Vitaly Orlov who has even more trouble dealing with guilt about what they do; Bridget Moynahan gives a sterling performance as the trophy wife who is deeply disturbed to learn where the wealth which supports her comfortable life comes from.Eamonn Walker gives a chilling performance as Orlov's most lucrative and dangerous customer, President Andre Baptiste of Liberia. This character appears to be based on former Liberian President Charles Taylor, who is currently awaiting trial on War Crimes charges before the Hague tribunal.Ethan Hawke plays an idealistic Interpol agent who will do almost anything, except break the law himself, to stop gun-runners like Orlov.If you have seen the trailer for this, be warned that, like that for Cage's recent film ""The Weather Guy"" it shows quite a bit of black humour in the film which is laugh out loud funny out of context (e.g. in the trailer) but is not so amusing in context.As an edgy thriller or a story of moral destruction this film works. AS a political polemic, a number of the points it makes are direct hits but it is easy to pick holes in and rather one-sided, especially at the end where the film suggests all government supplies of arms are morally equivalent to traders like Orlov.Some government supplies of arms may be on that level, but without an arms industry and supply of weapons we would have had nothing with which to fight evils such as the Nazis. With no arms industry, those of us who have no Jewish blood would have to ask ""How High?"" whenever a fascist Gauleiter said ""Jump!"" and those who do have Jewish ancestry would not be alive.For fans of Nicolas Cage this is possibly the best performance of his career. Worth watching if you want to see a dramatic portrait of material success and moral decline. Not a good film to watch if you want a piece of light entertainment or cheering up.",4,Polemic against the arms trade,1175299200,"03 31, 2007",2007,4100,"['One', 'adverts', 'start', 'version', 'DVD', 'watched', 'was', 'placed', 'campaign', 'arms', 'trade', 'advert', 'took', 'form', 'spoof', 'TV', 'advert', 'weapons', 'difficult', 'see', 'what', 'people', 'who', 'paid', 'advert', 'thought', 'were', 'adding', 'what', 'already', 'disc', 'essentially', 'film', 'much', 'longer', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'version', 'same', 'point.Nicolas', 'Cage', 'central', 'character', 'narrator', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'what', 'now', 'Ukraine', 'emigrated', 'former', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'parents', 'international', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Obviously', 'damaged', 'inside', 'human', 'consequences', 'trade', 'Orlov', 'deal', 'distancing', 'actions', 'customers', 'avoiding', 'crimes', 'other', 'gun-running', 'When', 'Columbian', 'drug', 'baron', 'pay', 'cocaine', 'rather', 'money', 'Orlov', ""'m"", 'am', 'arms', 'trader', 'not', 'drug', 'dealer', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'customers', 'tries', 'reward', 'Orlov', 'providing', 'plate', 'opportunity', 'take', 'revenge', 'rival', 'arms', 'dealer', 'who', 'had', 'murdered', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'uncle', 'had', 'been', 'close', 'uncle', 'upset', 'murder', 'Orlov', 'not', 'want', 'pull', 'trigger', 'kill', 'man', 'responsible', 'even', 'duress.Cage', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'could', 'bring', 'off', 'studied', 'understatement', 'ironic', 'black', 'humour', 'required', 'central', 'character', 'narrator', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'exactly', 'going', 'Orlov', 'head', 'When', 'Gorbachov', 'TV', 'announcing', 'end', 'cold', 'war', 'Yuri', 'so', 'delighted', 'barely', 'wife', 'Eva', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'saying', 'baby', 'son', 'walking', 'first', 'time', 'are', 'unclear', 'so', 'pleased', 'country', 'birth', 'will', 'mean', 'more', 'opportunties', 'gun', 'running.Most', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'clear', 'Orlov', 'wealth', 'would', 'not', 'want', 'change', 'places', 'one', 'point', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'Jack', 'Valentine', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'nearest', 'thing', 'film', 'hero', ""'d"", 'tell', 'go', 'Hell', 'think', ""'re"", 'already', 'there', 'Strong', 'performance', 'number', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Yuri', 'brother', 'sidekick', 'Vitaly', 'Orlov', 'who', 'even', 'more', 'trouble', 'dealing', 'guilt', 'what', 'do', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'sterling', 'performance', 'trophy', 'wife', 'who', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'learn', 'where', 'wealth', 'comfortable', 'life', 'from.Eamonn', 'Walker', 'chilling', 'performance', 'Orlov', 'most', 'lucrative', 'dangerous', 'customer', 'President', 'Andre', 'Baptiste', 'Liberia', 'character', 'be', 'based', 'former', 'Liberian', 'President', 'Charles', 'Taylor', 'who', 'currently', 'awaiting', 'trial', 'War', 'Crimes', 'Hague', 'tribunal.Ethan', 'Hawke', 'idealistic', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'almost', 'anything', 'break', 'law', 'stop', 'gun-runners', 'Orlov.If', 'have', 'seen', 'trailer', 'be', 'warned', 'Cage', 'recent', 'film', 'Weather', 'Guy', 'quite', 'bit', 'black', 'humour', 'film', 'loud', 'funny', 'context', 'e.g', 'trailer', 'not', 'so', 'amusing', 'context.As', 'edgy', 'thriller', 'story', 'moral', 'destruction', 'film', 'political', 'polemic', 'number', 'points', 'are', 'direct', 'hits', 'easy', 'pick', 'holes', 'rather', 'one-sided', 'especially', 'end', 'where', 'film', 'government', 'supplies', 'arms', 'are', 'morally', 'equivalent', 'traders', 'Orlov.Some', 'government', 'supplies', 'arms', 'may', 'be', 'level', 'arms', 'industry', 'supply', 'weapons', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'nothing', 'fight', 'evils', 'such', 'Nazis', 'arms', 'industry', 'who', 'have', 'Jewish', 'blood', 'would', 'have', 'ask', 'How', 'High', 'whenever', 'fascist', 'Gauleiter', 'said', 'Jump', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'Jewish', 'ancestry', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'alive.For', 'fans', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'possibly', 'best', 'performance', 'career', 'watching', 'want', 'see', 'dramatic', 'portrait', 'material', 'success', 'moral', 'decline', 'Not', 'good', 'film', 'watch', 'want', 'piece', 'light', 'entertainment', 'cheering', 'up']",N/A

It does a particularly fine job demonstrating what people like Victor Bout made possible in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone (think ""Lord of the Flies"" in Africa).  Some of the vignettes are priceless like when Yuri (the character played by Nicolas Cage) evades having a freighter of his laden with contraband seized the authorities through a hastily improvised deception.  Another great moment is when we get to see happens to valuable property like cargo planes when they are left unattended in places like Liberia and Sierra Leone (think ""chop shop"" on an epic scale).The movie does have some problems with it that prevent me from giving it five stars:-The plotline involving Yuri's wife is pretty unbelievable.  If you are married to someone like Victor Bout for a long period of time and you profess to be oblivious to his business, you're either lying, being willfully blind, or are too stupid to live.-The idea that after Yuri had been indicted and arrested (and a trailer full of incriminating evidence seized as well), he could be sprung from jail by some shadowy US Army officer is ludicrous.  How do I know this?  Because, I did a study on another one of nature's noblemen Manuel Noriega some years back.  Even though he was once very useful to the US and in the pay of the CIA, once he was indicted for drug trafficking, it became impossible for the US to use him as proxie.  The same thing would apply in Yuri's case.  Once he was indicted, I'm sure that anyone who was making use of him would have dropped him like a hot potatoe.My final beef with the movie is the text that comes on the screen right before the credits role.  The words tell us --quite accurately-- that the world's biggest sellers of arms are the US and the other permanent members of the Security Council.That is very true, but what the movie doesn't tell the viewer is that the nature of US and British arms sales tends to be things like ships, planes, guided missiles, and other high-tech toys.  These items aren't the tools of atrocities like those committed in Sierra Leone and Liberia in the late 1990s.  Those things --AK-47s, machine-guns, are the items in Victor Bout's product line.  Lumping sales of weapons to countries at peace with themselves and their neighbors in with criminal sales of ""gear"" to people like Charles Tailor of Liberia and the hand-chopping ""RUF"" of Sierra Leone is completely unfair and is a gross distortion of the facts.",4,An excellent movie with a couple of flaws,1137110400,"01 13, 2006",2006,2806,"['Lord', 'War', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Americanized', 'fictionalized', 'biography', 'notorious', 'Russian', 'arms', 'dealer', 'Victor', 'Bout', 'real', 'death', 'merchant', 'who', 'literally', 'made', 'killing', 'fall', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'selling', 'weapons', 'pretty', 'much', 'anyone', 'who', 'could', 'pay', 'Lord', 'War', 'when', 'gunrunning', 'excellent', 'movie', 'particularly', 'fine', 'job', 'demonstrating', 'what', 'people', 'Victor', 'Bout', 'made', 'possible', 'places', 'Liberia', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'think', 'Lord', 'Flies', 'Africa', 'vignettes', 'are', 'priceless', 'when', 'Yuri', 'character', 'played', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'having', 'freighter', 'laden', 'contraband', 'seized', 'authorities', 'hastily', 'improvised', 'deception', 'great', 'moment', 'when', 'get', 'see', 'happens', 'valuable', 'property', 'cargo', 'planes', 'when', 'are', 'left', 'unattended', 'places', 'Liberia', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'think', 'chop', 'shop', 'epic', 'scale', '.The', 'movie', 'have', 'problems', 'prevent', 'giving', 'five', 'stars', '-The', 'plotline', 'involving', 'Yuri', 'wife', 'pretty', 'unbelievable', 'are', 'married', 'someone', 'Victor', 'Bout', 'long', 'period', 'time', 'profess', 'be', 'oblivious', 'business', ""'re"", 'lying', 'being', 'willfully', 'blind', 'are', 'too', 'stupid', 'live.-The', 'idea', 'Yuri', 'had', 'been', 'indicted', 'arrested', 'trailer', 'full', 'incriminating', 'evidence', 'seized', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'be', 'sprung', 'jail', 'shadowy', 'US', 'Army', 'officer', 'ludicrous', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'did', 'study', 'one', 'nature', 'noblemen', 'Manuel', 'Noriega', 'years', 'back', 'Even', 'was', 'once', 'very', 'useful', 'US', 'pay', 'CIA', 'once', 'was', 'indicted', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'became', 'impossible', 'US', 'use', 'proxie', 'same', 'thing', 'would', 'apply', 'Yuri', 'case', 'was', 'indicted', ""'m"", 'sure', 'anyone', 'who', 'was', 'making', 'use', 'would', 'have', 'dropped', 'hot', 'potatoe.My', 'final', 'beef', 'movie', 'text', 'screen', 'right', 'credits', 'role', 'words', 'tell', 'quite', 'accurately', 'world', 'biggest', 'sellers', 'arms', 'are', 'US', 'other', 'permanent', 'members', 'Security', 'Council.That', 'very', 'true', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'tell', 'viewer', 'nature', 'US', 'British', 'arms', 'sales', 'tends', 'be', 'things', 'ships', 'planes', 'guided', 'missiles', 'other', 'high-tech', 'toys', 'items', 'are', ""n't"", 'tools', 'atrocities', 'committed', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'Liberia', 'late', '1990s', 'things', 'AK-47s', 'machine-guns', 'are', 'items', 'Victor', 'Bout', 'product', 'line', 'Lumping', 'sales', 'weapons', 'countries', 'peace', 'neighbors', 'criminal', 'sales', 'gear', 'people', 'Charles', 'Tailor', 'Liberia', 'hand-chopping', 'RUF', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'completely', 'unfair', 'gross', 'distortion', 'facts']",N/A

952858,ARF5OI5V9OI00,B000BYA5G4,Max A. Lebow,"[1, 3]","The last work about arms dealing that I grappled with was ""Major Barbara"", a play by George Bernard Shaw. It was a morality tale of a young woman, a Major in the Salvation Army, who finds her work supported by an arms dealer. Surprisingly, the arms dealers in the play and the movie have some of the same rationalizations for their work. They don't kill anyone. They don't start wars. They are only in business. If they don't do it, someone else will. Everyone does it, including governments.So, not much has changed, except the venue. Shaw set his play in England. The DVD, written and directed by Andrew Niccol, is set mainly in Africa, in Utah made to look like Africa, with scenes in New York, and the Czech Republic made to look like the Ukraine.This is a work of art as compelling as ""Hotel Rwanda,"" and just as bleak, if not more so. It broad brushes Africa as the ""dark continent"" as much as Josef Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness.""However, a hundred years have passed since Shaw and Conrad wrote about gun-running and Africa, respectively. Surely something has changed, has it not?Maybe not. Shaw's arms dealer, Undershaft, is charming, generous, and ruthless. So is Nicholas Cage as Yuri Orlov. The world of both the play and DVD is a complex web of moral ambiguity, hiding the most murderous of crimes.The scene in the DVD in which refugees in a tent city are set upon by wild marauders armed with machetes and the ubiquitous AK-47s seems more similar to what is happening in Darfur than anything in Liberia, where the scene is supposed to take place.Africa no longer needs to be painted with such a broad brush. True, the DVD is about arms dealing, not per se about Africa, but still, give the continent a break. There is tourism. There are some economies that work. There are a couple of democracies. It is not all war lords. Isak Dinesen did a great job of writing about the beauty of the continent in ""Out of Africa,"" albeit in colonial times. However, to include travelogue and contrast within the DVD would have not been feasible because the DVD is a thriller.And the Liberian dictator played by Eamonn Walker is a classic character as well. But do we need another ""Emperor Jones?"" Probably not, but just the same, the title comes from the dictator's shaky English. Cage points out that when the dictator says ""lord of war,"" he means warlord. ""Just the same,"" says the dictator, ""I like it my way.""As often happens in thrillers, the government of the United States is shown as ineffective enforcing the laws against gun-running, and actually supportive of it. It is true, as Cage tells the erstwhile agent who has arrested him, the government is the biggest arms dealer. I'm not so sure about Cage's further assertion that the government needs freelancers, to keep their fingerprints off.The moral glimmer here is that Yuri, with all his wealth, connections, and power, still goes to Hell. What a way to make a living.This DVD illuminates a business that is practiced, quietly, by people among us, who may look no different than you or I.

Smith,"[2, 6]","Yuri Orlov (well played by Nicolas Cage), Ukrainian immigrant kid in Brooklyn in the early `80s, casting about for a career, witnesses an assassination attempt on a local mafioso and thinks: Weapons. Everyone wants them, everyone needs them. From selling a single Uzi to a local hood, he progresses to buying up abandoned U.S. small arms overseas, to shipping every kind of munitions you can think of to every part of the globe. Then it's 1992 and the Soviet Union collapses, and ex-Soviet army officers in all the various republics begin selling off the weapons systems under their control in order to replace their lost paychecks -- several billions of dollars worth from the newly-independent Ukraine alone. Most of his buyers are African, especially the bloodthirsty dictator of Liberia and his cannibalistic son -- and the Orlov character, who's well aware of what his trade facilitates, has a number of perceptive and pungent things to say about the West's attitudes toward the multiple African genocides of the `90s. (There are a number of shocking scenes and camera shots that are definitely *not* for kids.) Meanwhile, Yuri has acquired a wife, a high-priced model, to whom he lies continually regarding his business, until the straight-arrow ATF agent (or maybe he's Interpol; it's not clear) who has been pursuing her husband for years clues her in. Finally, Yuri's extremely troubled younger brother is killed during a deal in Sierra Leone and it's an overlooked bullet in his body, shipped back to the States, that leads to Yuri's arrest. The climactic scene, in which Yuri explains to the agent exactly how and why no charges will ever be brought -- the government *needs* men like him, though they'll never admit it -- is like a bullet between the eyes. The world's largest arms dealer, in fact, lives in the White House, selling as many weapons in a day as Yuri does in a month. And the largest arms brokers in the world are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Mr. Cage is always watchable and LORD OF WAR has excellent production values. However, I found LORD OF WAR to be little more than a fictionalized documentary on gun-running. That is because there is little plot and little characterization. Mostly, we see Yuri going about his job running guns and his domestic life when he is not. While Yuri must deal with unsavory characters and eager-beaver US feds trying to put him out of business, there is little conflict of the type that sustains a principal storyline. Yuri is not even really much torn with guilt or indecision about being a gun-runner. Actually, he provides the film's arguments in favor of gun-running. (Someone will do it. People are evil, not the AK 47s. Etc.) His cocain-addled brother and the director and writer provide the counter arguments, leaning of course against gun-running. I mean, this is Hollywood, which in no way is going to come out in favor of gun-running. But, surprisingly, this is a fairly balanced presentation of the pros and cons and of the reality of the world of small wars, where people need weapons. (Think of the Tutis in Rwanda. They could have used a few AK 47s to keep hundreds of thousands of them from being chopped up by Hutus.)

Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) immigrated to Brighton Beach from the Ukraine with his family in the 1970s, where he had the revelation, after witnessing a mob hit in a restaurant, that, just as people will always have to eat, they will always have to kill. After selling guns to local mobsters for a while, he realizes, ""The real money is in actual wars. Between countries."" Shunned by the big-time arms dealers who operated with the CIA's blessing during the Cold War, Yuri turns to the gray market with his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) in tow. Idealistic Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) becomes his persistent pursuer.""Lord of War"" is told in biographical fashion, with Yuri delivering a biting, witty voiceover narration about his adventures in the arms trade throughout the film. The narration is smart, ironic, and funny. But it is delivered with droning lethargy by a self-loathing, vaguely regretful Yuri. This exemplifies ""Lord of War""'s fatal flaw. Writer/director Andrew Niccol doesn't like his protagonist, hates guns, and probably disdains political violence in general. What's worse, Yuri is telling the story, so his own angsty, guilt-ridden delivery reflects his director's bias. Imagine reading a novel that is narrated in the first person by someone who can't stand himself. You will have a pretty good idea of what it's like to watch this film. Yuri is an interesting character who has a provocative story to tell. But he tells it with bored detachment, acute self-loathing, and without a trace of the salesman's vigor and sheer nerve that it took to sell weapons to the world's scariest war-mongers. Arms dealers are not, in reality, burdened by excessive guilt. Yuri enjoys his business, and he's good at it. Yet he refuses to act like it.""Lord of War"" is ultimately critical of the arms trade. That's fine, but Andrew Niccol allowed his socio-political agenda to hamper his strengths. He wrote a smart, funny narration and then was afraid to let us laugh at it. The arms dealers and their ultra-violent clients are absurdly comical, but the film tries to shame us out of laughing at them. One minute, Yuri's commentary struck me as hilarious; the next minute I am being told that guns and killing is a very grave matter that only immoral people would make light of. ""Lord of War"" goes back and forth like this, constantly undermining itself. I commend actor Eamonn Walker for playing bloodthirsty Liberian President Andr&eacute; Baptiste, apparently based on deposed President Charles Taylor, with such gleeful viciousness that I couldn't help laughing at him. He seemed to understand that Baptiste was nuts but also completely ridiculous.  I like ""Lord of War""'s script a lot.

You are taken into a journey into a dark world full of corruption and violence.Pegged in the middle of it is Nicholas Cage's character, Yuri Orlov. We get to see his 40 year life span as he evolves from a peasant working at the family restaurant to a gun-selling ""maniac"" who becomes deeply obsessed into what he does. We see that as he becomes more induced into this dark, violent world of weapons, we his soul become darker as well. He lies to his wife and betrays the people he sells guns to. Yuri sells his guns to both sides of wars and states that he doesn't care who has the guns, it's that their using them. This is probably one of Nicholas Cage's finest and trickiest performances.This film feels like Scarface in the sense of a lower-class man starting out with minimal earnings and working his way up in a business most people would shun away from. Ethan Hawke plays a cop who is desperate to put him away. But, Yuri is always one step ahead of him in hiding all of his guns and evidence to prevent Hawke from getting any real evidence out of him.This is a very intelligent script with an intriguing premise that will plug you right into Yiri Orlov's life and well send you deeper into the corrupt, immoral man he becomes.",5,"A brilliant look at a ""behind the curtain"" look at guns and violence.",1127001600,"09 18, 2005",2005,1456,"['movie', 'superb', 'look', 'man', 'who', 'guns', 'living', 'countries', 'bad/good', 'choices', 'life.Watching', 'film', 'deep', 'insight', 'how', 'rival', 'countries', 'get', 'weapons', 'get', 'are', 'taken', 'journey', 'dark', 'world', 'full', 'corruption', 'violence.Pegged', 'middle', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'character', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'get', 'see', '40', 'year', 'life', 'span', 'peasant', 'working', 'family', 'restaurant', 'gun-selling', 'maniac', 'who', 'deeply', 'obsessed', 'what', 'see', 'more', 'induced', 'dark', 'violent', 'world', 'weapons', 'soul', 'become', 'darker', 'well', 'wife', 'people', 'guns', 'Yuri', 'guns', 'sides', 'wars', 'states', ""n't"", 'care', 'who', 'guns', 'using', 'probably', 'one', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'finest', 'trickiest', 'performances.This', 'film', 'feels', 'Scarface', 'sense', 'lower-class', 'man', 'starting', 'out', 'minimal', 'earnings', 'working', 'way', 'up', 'business', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'shun', 'away', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'cop', 'who', 'desperate', 'put', 'away', 'Yuri', 'always', 'one', 'step', 'ahead', 'hiding', 'guns', 'evidence', 'prevent', 'Hawke', 'getting', 'real', 'evidence', 'him.This', 'very', 'intelligent', 'script', 'intriguing', 'premise', 'will', 'plug', 'right', 'Yiri', 'Orlov', 'life', 'well', 'send', 'deeper', 'corrupt', 'immoral', 'man']",N/A

It's an all round look at what it means to be a gunrunner - how it came about that he became one, the good times - the bad.  The effect on family and loved ones.  At times serious, at times downright funny, often poignant, it's all the way through laced with its own style - a style which manages to pull off  the difficult feat of mixing entertaining and  thought provoking.  Through frequently quite imaginative editing and narrative, the story never gets dull.Cage is good in the role, but it's an all round effective supporting cast which make it really work - making his transition believable.  The change from just another immigrant, to a man dabbling in the guns business, to a man sucked in by his own choosing to a world of ugliness by the lure of riches - or rather, as he puts it.. just because it's  what he's good at.  A particularly effective and revealing moment comes when Cage is faced with a seemingly arbitrary murder during one of his sales pitches with the pistol he is selling.  His look of horror is quickly masked and replaced with indignation that the new gun has been soiled by use and is now worth less.  It's a theme throughout - at one point is it no longer possible to separate the business of what you are doing from the effect of what you are doing.  Does it happen immediately you start down the path - or does it happen after a time?  Of note is the contrast to how his brother, played by a fantastic Jared Leto, is affected.How far embroiled in a world can you be without being affected... it's an interesting question, and one made all the more fascinating by the context  of how much gunrunning our own governments do routinely, as the movie points out.Definitely recommended as an entertaining blockbuster - but with some brains to go with it.",5,Does for Gunrunners what Goodfells did for gangsters,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2009,1913,"['surprisingly', 'good', 'movie', 'tale', 'gunrunner', 'several', 'decades', 'life', 'not', 'action', 'movie', 'not', 'just', 'drama', 'round', 'look', 'what', 'be', 'gunrunner', 'how', 'came', 'became', 'one', 'good', 'times', 'bad', 'effect', 'family', 'loved', 'ones', 'times', 'serious', 'times', 'downright', 'funny', 'often', 'poignant', 'way', 'laced', 'own', 'style', 'style', 'pull', 'off', 'difficult', 'feat', 'mixing', 'entertaining', 'thought', 'provoking', 'frequently', 'quite', 'imaginative', 'editing', 'narrative', 'story', 'never', 'dull.Cage', 'good', 'role', 'round', 'effective', 'supporting', 'cast', 'make', 'really', 'work', 'making', 'transition', 'believable', 'change', 'just', 'immigrant', 'man', 'dabbling', 'guns', 'business', 'man', 'sucked', 'own', 'choosing', 'world', 'ugliness', 'lure', 'riches', 'rather', 'it..', 'just', 'what', 'good', 'particularly', 'effective', 'revealing', 'moment', 'when', 'Cage', 'faced', 'seemingly', 'arbitrary', 'murder', 'one', 'sales', 'pitches', 'pistol', 'selling', 'look', 'horror', 'quickly', 'masked', 'replaced', 'indignation', 'new', 'gun', 'been', 'soiled', 'use', 'now', 'worth', 'less', 'theme', 'one', 'point', 'no', 'longer', 'possible', 'separate', 'business', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'effect', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'happen', 'immediately', 'start', 'down', 'path', 'happen', 'time', 'note', 'contrast', 'how', 'brother', 'played', 'fantastic', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'affected.How', 'far', 'embroiled', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'being', 'affected', 'interesting', 'question', 'one', 'made', 'more', 'fascinating', 'context', 'how', 'much', 'gunrunning', 'own', 'governments', 'do', 'routinely', 'movie', 'points', 'out.Definitely', 'recommended', 'entertaining', 'blockbuster', 'brains', 'go']",N/A

952881,A12ANFNOSMW5VD,B000BYA5G4,"Penfist ""Dulce bellum inexpertis""","[23, 39]","I watched Lord of War starring Nicholas Cage last night. It sucked.I won't give away all the details in case you want to watch it for yourself. The acting is somewhat flat, but it's tolerable. What's truly sucky about the movie is the moral message - it's muddled. I'm not sure what the main message is. Perhaps the movie's creator was trying to say something meaningful about warfare, but I couldn't figure out what it was. Perhaps he wanted us all to believe that arms dealers are the source of all evil. Perhaps he wanted to ram home the message that the permanent members of the United Nations security council are also the world's largest arms dealers.The irony of making a movie portraying Western nations as the devils behind every third world war is that the most horrible scene in the movie is a scene in which a mother and son are hacked to death by a gang of thugs armed with machetes and the only man with a conscience about it is a Westerner. The whole movie is based on a fictional arms dealer played by Cage and a very loose intrepretation of a very real and very evil character named Charles Taylor, who at one time in the fairly recent past ruled Liberia.Lord of War sucks because it pushes the idea that the major militaries of the world are behind all the evil in the world when the truth is that evil exists mostly independent of those military forces. Some men, if given a rock, will use it to bash in the heads of anyone they can.In particular, the scene in which Nicholas Cage and his brother are meeting with a Sierra Leone warlord on a rise above a refugee camp was unrealistic. The scene shows a tent camp filled with unarmed Africans being circled by a single truck filled with machete wielding thugs. While Cage negotiates over a payment of ""blood diamonds"" for his two trucks filled with guns, RPGs and grenades, his brother watches a child try to escape the camp, followed by the mother. Both of them are hacked to death with machetes while curled up in a fetal position.The scene tugs at the emotional strings of anyone watching, but the premise of the scene is as flawed as the premise of the movie. Men with machetes and murderous intent don't need black market guns to kill a camp full of refugees. In real life, they'll use the machetes if that's all they have. In real life, Nicholas Cage would never have been able to negotiate his diamonds for guns deal above a refugee camp full of innocents waiting to be slaughtered. They would have been slaughtered prior to his arrival with whatever was available.Lord of War is based on the same flawed thinking that motivates anti-gun crusaders in the U.S. to try and outlaw personal weapons ownership. Blaming guns for what lives in the hearts and minds of men is silly, and doesn't solve any long-term problems of men killing other men. You don't build responsible, healthy societies by dumbing down the population and more than you do by killing anyone who disagrees with you.Lord of War shows us an inaccurate picture of war as it tries to blame all of Africa's problems on the West. There are no scenes showing British peacekeepers as they end the civil war in Sierra Leone. There are no scenes showing any of the centuries long history of tribal warfare that has gone on in the region. None of Liberia's history is put into context. All we are presented with is an amoral arms dealer and the impression that the U.S. government is behind all the violence in Africa because of shadowy arms deals and greedy profiteers. Taking pieces of the truth and rearranging them to fit your worldview is a dangerous business with far reaching consequences.You might want to watch Lord of War, but I would highly recommend researching the history of the larger events portrayed in the movie prior to doing so. In particular, I would recommend reading the full history of Liberia and Sierra Leone. The U.S. government has certainly been involved in the area for some time, but the real story is much more complex and layered than what we're shown in the movie.You can get some links and homework assignments related to this movie here, if you are interested in who is really to blame for some of the evil acts that have plagued Sierra Leone and Liberia for the last few decades - [...]",2,Unrealistic portrayal of war,1143072000,"03 23, 2006",2006,4254,"['watched', 'Lord', 'War', 'starring', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'last', 'night', 'sucked.I', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'details', 'case', 'want', 'watch', 'acting', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'tolerable', 'What', 'truly', 'sucky', 'movie', 'moral', 'message', 'muddled', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'main', 'message', 'Perhaps', 'movie', 'creator', 'was', 'trying', 'say', 'something', 'meaningful', 'warfare', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'Perhaps', 'wanted', 'believe', 'arms', 'dealers', 'are', 'source', 'evil', 'Perhaps', 'wanted', 'ram', 'home', 'message', 'permanent', 'members', 'United', 'Nations', 'security', 'council', 'are', 'also', 'world', 'largest', 'arms', 'dealers.The', 'irony', 'making', 'movie', 'portraying', 'Western', 'nations', 'devils', 'third', 'world', 'war', 'most', 'horrible', 'scene', 'movie', 'scene', 'mother', 'son', 'are', 'hacked', 'death', 'gang', 'thugs', 'armed', 'machetes', 'only', 'man', 'conscience', 'Westerner', 'whole', 'movie', 'based', 'fictional', 'arms', 'dealer', 'played', 'Cage', 'very', 'loose', 'intrepretation', 'very', 'real', 'very', 'evil', 'character', 'named', 'Charles', 'Taylor', 'who', 'one', 'time', 'fairly', 'recent', 'past', 'ruled', 'Liberia.Lord', 'War', 'sucks', 'idea', 'major', 'militaries', 'world', 'are', 'evil', 'world', 'when', 'truth', 'evil', 'mostly', 'independent', 'military', 'forces', 'men', 'given', 'rock', 'will', 'use', 'bash', 'heads', 'anyone', 'can.In', 'particular', 'scene', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'brother', 'are', 'meeting', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'warlord', 'rise', 'refugee', 'camp', 'was', 'unrealistic', 'scene', 'tent', 'camp', 'filled', 'unarmed', 'Africans', 'being', 'circled', 'single', 'truck', 'filled', 'machete', 'wielding', 'thugs', 'Cage', 'negotiates', 'payment', 'blood', 'diamonds', 'two', 'trucks', 'filled', 'guns', 'RPGs', 'grenades', 'brother', 'child', 'try', 'escape', 'camp', 'followed', 'mother', 'are', 'hacked', 'death', 'machetes', 'curled', 'up', 'fetal', 'position.The', 'scene', 'tugs', 'emotional', 'strings', 'anyone', 'watching', 'premise', 'scene', 'as', 'flawed', 'premise', 'movie', 'Men', 'machetes', 'murderous', 'intent', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'black', 'market', 'guns', 'kill', 'camp', 'full', 'refugees', 'real', 'life', ""'ll"", 'use', 'machetes', 'have', 'real', 'life', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'negotiate', 'diamonds', 'guns', 'deal', 'refugee', 'camp', 'full', 'innocents', 'waiting', 'be', 'slaughtered', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'slaughtered', 'prior', 'arrival', 'was', 'available.Lord', 'War', 'based', 'same', 'flawed', 'thinking', 'anti-gun', 'crusaders', 'U.S.', 'try', 'outlaw', 'personal', 'weapons', 'ownership', 'Blaming', 'guns', 'what', 'hearts', 'minds', 'men', 'silly', ""n't"", 'solve', 'long-term', 'problems', 'men', 'killing', 'other', 'men', 'do', ""n't"", 'build', 'responsible', 'healthy', 'societies', 'dumbing', 'down', 'population', 'more', 'do', 'killing', 'anyone', 'who', 'you.Lord', 'War', 'inaccurate', 'picture', 'war', 'blame', 'Africa', 'problems', 'West', 'are', 'scenes', 'showing', 'British', 'peacekeepers', 'end', 'civil', 'war', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'are', 'scenes', 'showing', 'centuries', 'long', 'history', 'tribal', 'warfare', 'gone', 'region', 'None', 'Liberia', 'history', 'put', 'context', 'are', 'presented', 'amoral', 'arms', 'dealer', 'impression', 'U.S.', 'government', 'violence', 'Africa', 'shadowy', 'arms', 'deals', 'greedy', 'profiteers', 'Taking', 'pieces', 'truth', 'rearranging', 'fit', 'worldview', 'dangerous', 'business', 'far', 'reaching', 'consequences.You', 'might', 'want', 'watch', 'Lord', 'War', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'researching', 'history', 'larger', 'events', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'prior', 'doing', 'so', 'particular', 'would', 'recommend', 'reading', 'full', 'history', 'Liberia', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'U.S.', 'government', 'certainly', 'been', 'involved', 'area', 'time', 'real', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'complex', 'layered', 'what', ""'re"", 'shown', 'movie.You', 'can', 'get', 'links', 'homework', 'assignments', 'related', 'movie', 'here', 'are', 'interested', 'who', 'really', 'blame', 'evil', 'acts', 'have', 'plagued', 'Sierra', 'Leone', 'Liberia', 'last', 'few', 'decades', '[', ']']",N/A

Upon reflection, that's not terribly surprising, given how strong a film it is; good things, it often seems, never flourish in the sandy, sandy soil of Hollywood. And Niccol (Gattaca) has created a good thing here.Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law. Or they are until Vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab, leaving Yuri to fly solo-- just as the Berlin Wall comes down and the arms market takes off. Yuri is being dogged by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an FBI agent who's sure he's breaking the law.As an action movie, it's kind of fun, interesting, a bit slow at times but watchable all the same. As a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who's just trying to make his way in the world, it's incisive, well-done, witty, charming. However, the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties. Yuri Orlov is the perfect character to allow Niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time. Yuri traipses through the former Soviet Union and Africa, and Niccol follows with his camera, casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled (at best) analogues of real dictators.

Crawford,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty good film about a man who self-actualizes the corruption that is in the deepest part of his soul as a black market arms dealer.  Cage narrates this life - out only for himself, regardless of who he helps to kill - and it is effective to a degree.  We witness his rise, his many ruses to avoid prison or execution, and its repercussions on his personal life.  I admit, Cage's dark humor and splendidly indifferent tone are at times funny and affecting.  But the best characterizations, I think, are in the people he encounters, from the cold rival arms dealer he fights to the brutal African thug who makes him rich.  It is very good acting.Nonetheless, this is Hollywood trying to display some social conscience.  There is a kind of breathlessness to it, like they are revealing something to the audience, almost as reporting, but I found its sincerity rather naive.  While it is good to expose audiences to this, I suppose, the tone of the film implies that none of us know about these kinds of people already.

952889,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B000BYA5G4,Roland E. Zwick,"[4, 5]","*SPOILERS*""Lord of War"" is a genuine cinematic rarity: a mainstream black comedy that doesn't soften its material or compromise its vision to cater to audience sensibilities.  Nicholas Cage plays the world's foremost private small arms dealer, whose key to success lies in the fact that he never chooses sides in any armed conflict, opting instead to be an equal opportunity ""merchant of death"" to all.  For Yuri Orlov, peace is the only real enemy, and if innocent people have to die to keep him in clover, well, hell, he didn`t make this world, and there`s no reason why he shouldn`t get his if everybody else is getting theirs.Like a master chef working his way to the heart of an artichoke, writer/director Andrew Niccol peels back the layers of his story to reveal the truths of the international gunrunning trade.  Yuri is a chilling and disturbing character precisely because he is so utterly ordinary and difficult to read.  Niccol does not portray him as evil incarnate, but, rather, as a reasonably well-adapted family man who just happens to be good at what he does and has the requisite capacity for self-rationalization that allows him to do his job and still live with himself.  To his own way of thinking, Yuri is really no different from the man who sells tobacco or automobiles - both products, he explains, that actually result in the deaths of more people than firearms - then goes home to the love and adoration of his wife and kids.  Yuri doesn't sell arms because he had an unhappy childhood or out of any sense of entitlement because he feels the world has treated him badly.  He simply knows that if he weren't doing business with these murderous dictators - or as they like to call themselves ""freedom fighters"" - around the world, somebody else would be.Most of the dark humor of the film comes from the detached, flippant and unemotional commentary Yuri provides as the film's narrator.  He is quick to point out the ironies and absurdities inherent in so much of the arms business, and it is only the gruesome seriousness of the consequences that makes us catch our throats as we laugh.  And Niccol certainly makes it clear that Yuri is only small potatoes compared to the governments who put far more weaponry into the hands of thugs and mercenaries than Yuri ever does.  That little detail, snuck into a title card in the final moments, is the ultimate depressing reality Niccol uses to bring down the curtain on his film.  In fact, Niccol bravely refuses to ""redeem"" his character at the end.  Yuri loses just about everything and everyone he cares about at the end thanks to his activities, but the world goes on and he's decided he's going to go right on along with it.  And why in the world not?  Selling arms is ""just what he does.""In a very nuanced and balanced performance, Cage conveys just the right note of dispassionate detachment without ever becoming either too callous or too maudlin.  Yuri seems to genuinely like people and obviously loves his parents, his drug addict brother, his wife and his young son.  That only makes his ability to compartmentalize his morality that much more frightening.  Ethan Hawke gives a strong performance as the Javert-like Interpol agent obsessed with bringing Yuri to international justice, and Bridget Moynihan is stoic and sweet as the beautiful young wife who is willing to turn a blind eye to Yuri`s activities for only so long before finally confronting her husband.Funny as well as chilling, ""Lord of War"" will give you a whole new terrifying perspective on how the world actually works.",4,incisive black comedy,1168560000,"01 12, 2007",2007,3572,"['*SPOILERS*', 'Lord', 'War', 'genuine', 'cinematic', 'rarity', 'mainstream', 'black', 'comedy', ""n't"", 'soften', 'material', 'compromise', 'vision', 'cater', 'audience', 'sensibilities', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'world', 'foremost', 'private', 'small', 'arms', 'dealer', 'key', 'success', 'lies', 'fact', 'never', 'sides', 'armed', 'conflict', 'opting', 'instead', 'be', 'equal', 'opportunity', 'merchant', 'death', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'peace', 'only', 'real', 'enemy', 'innocent', 'people', 'have', 'die', 'keep', 'clover', 'well', 'hell', 't', 'make', 'world', 'there', 's', 'reason', 'why', 'shouldn', 't', 'get', 'everybody', 'else', 'getting', 'master', 'chef', 'working', 'way', 'heart', 'artichoke', 'writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'back', 'layers', 'story', 'reveal', 'truths', 'international', 'gunrunning', 'trade', 'Yuri', 'chilling', 'disturbing', 'character', 'precisely', 'so', 'utterly', 'ordinary', 'difficult', 'read', 'Niccol', 'not', 'portray', 'evil', 'incarnate', 'rather', 'reasonably', 'well-adapted', 'family', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'be', 'good', 'what', 'requisite', 'capacity', 'self-rationalization', 'do', 'job', 'still', 'live', 'own', 'way', 'thinking', 'Yuri', 'really', 'different', 'man', 'who', 'tobacco', 'automobiles', 'products', 'actually', 'result', 'deaths', 'more', 'people', 'firearms', 'then', 'home', 'love', 'adoration', 'wife', 'kids', 'Yuri', ""n't"", 'sell', 'arms', 'had', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'sense', 'entitlement', 'world', 'treated', 'badly', 'simply', 'were', ""n't"", 'doing', 'business', 'murderous', 'dictators', 'like', 'call', 'freedom', 'fighters', 'world', 'somebody', 'else', 'would', 'be.Most', 'dark', 'humor', 'film', 'detached', 'flippant', 'unemotional', 'commentary', 'Yuri', 'film', 'narrator', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'ironies', 'absurdities', 'inherent', 'so', 'much', 'arms', 'business', 'only', 'gruesome', 'seriousness', 'consequences', 'catch', 'throats', 'laugh', 'Niccol', 'certainly', 'clear', 'Yuri', 'only', 'small', 'potatoes', 'compared', 'governments', 'who', 'put', 'far', 'more', 'weaponry', 'hands', 'thugs', 'mercenaries', 'Yuri', 'ever', 'little', 'detail', 'snuck', 'title', 'card', 'final', 'moments', 'ultimate', 'depressing', 'reality', 'Niccol', 'bring', 'down', 'curtain', 'film', 'fact', 'Niccol', 'bravely', 'redeem', 'character', 'end', 'Yuri', 'just', 'everything', 'everyone', 'end', 'thanks', 'activities', 'world', 'decided', 'going', 'go', 'right', 'why', 'world', 'not', 'Selling', 'arms', 'just', 'what', 'very', 'nuanced', 'balanced', 'performance', 'Cage', 'conveys', 'just', 'right', 'note', 'dispassionate', 'detachment', 'ever', 'becoming', 'too', 'callous', 'too', 'maudlin', 'Yuri', 'genuinely', 'like', 'people', 'obviously', 'parents', 'drug', 'addict', 'brother', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'only', 'ability', 'compartmentalize', 'morality', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'strong', 'performance', 'Javert-like', 'Interpol', 'agent', 'obsessed', 'bringing', 'Yuri', 'international', 'justice', 'Bridget', 'Moynihan', 'stoic', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'young', 'wife', 'who', 'willing', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'Yuri', 's', 'activities', 'only', 'so', 'long', 'finally', 'confronting', 'husband.Funny', 'as', 'well', 'chilling', 'Lord', 'War', 'will', 'give', 'whole', 'new', 'terrifying', 'perspective', 'how', 'world', 'actually']",N/A

I got sick and tired of having my emotions blackmailed by the symbolism of children in this movie, first a couple of kids are getting shot by a firing squad in pakistan, then there's nick's own nauseating toddler being ""shot"" (he,he) up close to emphasize the child's wild eyed innocence and the dad's guilt and complicity (how deep is that?) then a few kids thrown here and there amongst the mayhem and debris in the countries nick ""visits"", and i almost puked in the scene where the drug dealers plane force lands just a few centimeters away from a two year old. Please, no MORE! And, come on, i know this is aimed at maistream audiences in just about every corner of the world, hence the lowest common denominator stategy, but even your average movie goer deserves better than that.Then there's the action, nothing much happens, and i mean that, the movie just doesn't change pace, nick's chased here and there by an interpol agent (and that doesn't happen all that often either) and by some loophole or trick he manages to escape the long hand of law, till, the catch him on a technicality and that about it folks.Then again, there's the complete implausibility of cage as gun dealer opperating alone (he occasionally takes his younger bro, presumably for the ride) with just a few paid contacts, come on, he's a friggin gun dealer!!! These people don't just pop up sell a few guns and leave...And then besides copola's nephew we get two very badly drawn, almost cartoonist, characters to serve as his wife and bro (the bro perpetually sniffing coke as a running gag i suppose) and the trophy wife in complete oblivion till just about five minutes from the end, talk about an undevelloped script, but i guess that's what hollywood wants these days. (The cliches of the film don't stop even when it comes to the music, one case in point, nick and bro crack a couple of lines of coke while driving around, and what inspired musical piece do we get? Can anyone guess? And yes, yes, it is j.j. cale's cocaine the bilionth time on film to emphasize, well, what else, coke.)Oh, and dialog is sharp, razor sharp, it's so sharp the screenwriter would probably have used this razor sharp analogy to say how sharp it is. Nick's bro out of the blue turns to him, gives him an intense and meaningful look, and goes ""these things are killing, you, on the inside"". Wow, the poetry in that. But of course an artful director muses with his camera too, as when nick finds his kid's toy gun and throws it (up close on the garbage bin) away. Brilliant, just brilliant.Barring the antirussian propaganda as another reviewer pointed out, i suppose this is one more of the multitude of cia financed flicks, i 'd be willing to give this one the benefit of the doubt  were it in any respect half decent, but trust me it isn't, or watch it if you got half a brain and weep over your hard earned money.",1,"Trite, Repetitive, Formulaic.",1129075200,"10 12, 2005",2005,3086,"['Cage', 'par', 'usual', 'wooden', 'acting', 'self', 'host', 'grimaces', 'disgust', 'dismay', 'i', 'll', 'hand', 'growing', 'more', 'more', 'hair', 'plot', 'so', 'formulaic', 'simplistic', 'also', 'got', 'sick', 'tired', 'having', 'emotions', 'blackmailed', 'symbolism', 'children', 'movie', 'first', 'couple', 'kids', 'are', 'getting', 'shot', 'firing', 'squad', 'pakistan', 'then', 'nick', 'own', 'nauseating', 'toddler', 'being', 'shot', 'up', 'close', 'emphasize', 'child', 'wild', 'eyed', 'innocence', 'dad', 'guilt', 'complicity', 'how', 'deep', 'then', 'few', 'kids', 'thrown', 'here', 'there', 'mayhem', 'debris', 'countries', 'nick', 'visits', 'almost', 'puked', 'scene', 'where', 'drug', 'dealers', 'plane', 'force', 'just', 'few', 'centimeters', 'away', 'two', 'year', 'old', 'Please', 'MORE', 'come', 'i', 'know', 'aimed', 'maistream', 'audiences', 'just', 'corner', 'world', 'hence', 'lowest', 'common', 'denominator', 'stategy', 'even', 'average', 'movie', 'goer', 'better', 'that.Then', 'action', 'nothing', 'much', 'happens', 'i', 'mean', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'change', 'pace', 'nick', 'chased', 'here', 'there', 'interpol', 'agent', ""n't"", 'happen', 'often', 'loophole', 'trick', 'escape', 'long', 'hand', 'law', 'till', 'catch', 'technicality', 'again', 'complete', 'implausibility', 'cage', 'gun', 'dealer', 'opperating', 'alone', 'occasionally', 'younger', 'bro', 'presumably', 'ride', 'just', 'few', 'paid', 'contacts', 'come', 'friggin', 'gun', 'dealer', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'pop', 'up', 'sell', 'few', 'guns', 'leave', 'then', 'copola', 'nephew', 'get', 'two', 'very', 'badly', 'drawn', 'almost', 'cartoonist', 'characters', 'serve', 'wife', 'bro', 'bro', 'perpetually', 'sniffing', 'coke', 'running', 'gag', 'i', 'suppose', 'trophy', 'wife', 'complete', 'oblivion', 'till', 'just', 'five', 'minutes', 'end', 'talk', 'undevelloped', 'script', 'i', 'guess', 'what', 'hollywood', 'days', 'cliches', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'stop', 'even', 'when', 'music', 'one', 'case', 'point', 'nick', 'bro', 'crack', 'couple', 'lines', 'coke', 'driving', 'around', 'what', 'inspired', 'musical', 'piece', 'do', 'get', 'Can', 'anyone', 'guess', 'yes', 'yes', 'j.j.', 'cale', 'cocaine', 'bilionth', 'time', 'film', 'emphasize', 'well', 'what', 'else', 'coke', 'Oh', 'dialog', 'sharp', 'razor', 'sharp', 'so', 'sharp', 'screenwriter', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'used', 'razor', 'sharp', 'analogy', 'say', 'how', 'sharp', 'Nick', 'bro', 'blue', 'intense', 'meaningful', 'look', 'things', 'are', 'killing', 'inside', 'Wow', 'poetry', 'course', 'artful', 'director', 'muses', 'camera', 'too', 'when', 'nick', 'kid', 'toy', 'gun', 'up', 'close', 'garbage', 'bin', 'away', 'Brilliant', 'just', 'brilliant.Barring', 'antirussian', 'propaganda', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'i', 'suppose', 'one', 'more', 'multitude', 'cia', 'financed', 'flicks', 'i', ""'d"", 'be', 'willing', 'give', 'one', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'were', 'respect', 'half', 'decent', ""n't"", 'watch', 'got', 'brain', 'weep', 'hard', 'earned', 'money']",N/A
952893,A32XW50ILWOXNO,B000BYA5G4,Samuel McKewon,"[3, 4]","""Lord of War"" opens with the creation of a bullet. It's molded, packed, shipped, plucked out of a bucket, loaded and fired into a child's head.Writer/director Andrew Niccol's film blunt like that, and clever. It darkens world events we thought blessed. Americans celebrated the end of the Cold War. So did freelance gun dealer Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage). The fall of Communism left bunkers of weapons and war vehicles without an army to use them. Yuri, a Brooklyn son of Russian immigrants, swoops into the Ukraine, cleans out the stockpile, and moves the ""merchandise"" to third-world dictators. The mass genocides that have rages through both of our Gulf Wars - in Africa, Bosnia, Southeast Asia - partially owe their existence to peace between two superpowers.Yuri owes his fortune, his New York penthouse, his trophy wife Ava (Bridgit Moynihan), his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his soul to it. Starting with Yuri's first Brooklyn gun deal in 1984 and progressing through the viciousness of West Africa that rages still, ""Lord of War"" traces his descent into the amoral, reckless, killing coward he becomes by movie's end. It's not necessarily a tragedy - Yuri's a willing crook, part nihilist, part purposeful ignoramus - but a sober essay on gluttony as a way of life, fueled by international apathy. ""The ones who know don't care anymore,"" Yuri says. ""And the ones who care won't know.""Yuri's lifestyle eventually leads him to the wars of West Africa in the late 1990s, specifically Liberia, run by a goofy fascist named Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker) and his son, Andre Jr. who owns a golden gun and drives a Ford Fairlane with two women dressed as Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders in the back. The Andres are Yuri's best clients and his worst temptation: They'll deliver him anything - enemies included - in exchange for guns.""Lord of War"" occasionally pauses to consider Yuri's personal life. Vitaly starts as a partner, but his distaste for the work presses him toward self-destruction and addiction. Leto does his wild-eyed thing to some effect. Moynihan had A looks and C skills, serving the role of the bland, pretty Ava well. Unremarkable beyond her looks - and aware of it - she places conscience above comfort to aid her husband's Javert, Interpol cop Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).Yuri crosses key moral lines in West Africa; fully given over to his sins, we doubt his attempts to go straight when Ava initially confronts him. But the last act falters; it needlessly shoehorns Vitaly back into the business and fashions a cynical, unlikely anti-climax between Yuri and Valentine that seeks to shift the debate from our charming villain to the system that permits his existence. Ever the dutiful liberal film, ""Lord of War"" tacks on a postscript about the no good, very bad UN Security Council, but I'll better remember the scene where Yuri stumbles around in Liberia to discover two growling hyenas. It's fitting company for him.",3,The modern gunrunner,1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,2942,"['Lord', 'War', 'creation', 'bullet', 'molded', 'packed', 'shipped', 'plucked', 'bucket', 'loaded', 'fired', 'child', 'head.Writer/director', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'film', 'blunt', 'clever', 'world', 'events', 'thought', 'blessed', 'Americans', 'celebrated', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'So', 'did', 'freelance', 'gun', 'dealer', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'fall', 'Communism', 'left', 'bunkers', 'weapons', 'war', 'vehicles', 'army', 'use', 'Yuri', 'Brooklyn', 'son', 'Russian', 'immigrants', 'swoops', 'Ukraine', 'out', 'stockpile', 'merchandise', 'third-world', 'dictators', 'mass', 'genocides', 'have', 'rages', 'Gulf', 'Wars', 'Africa', 'Bosnia', 'Southeast', 'Asia', 'partially', 'owe', 'existence', 'peace', 'two', 'superpowers.Yuri', 'fortune', 'New', 'York', 'penthouse', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Ava', 'Bridgit', 'Moynihan', 'brother', 'Vitaly', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'soul', 'Starting', 'Yuri', 'first', 'Brooklyn', 'gun', 'deal', '1984', 'progressing', 'viciousness', 'West', 'Africa', 'still', 'Lord', 'War', 'descent', 'amoral', 'reckless', 'killing', 'coward', 'movie', 'end', 'not', 'necessarily', 'tragedy', 'Yuri', 'willing', 'crook', 'part', 'nihilist', 'part', 'purposeful', 'ignoramus', 'sober', 'essay', 'gluttony', 'way', 'life', 'fueled', 'international', 'apathy', 'ones', 'who', 'know', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'anymore', 'Yuri', 'ones', 'who', 'care', 'wo', ""n't"", 'know', 'Yuri', 'lifestyle', 'eventually', 'wars', 'West', 'Africa', 'late', '1990s', 'specifically', 'Liberia', 'run', 'goofy', 'fascist', 'named', 'Andre', 'Baptiste', 'Eamonn', 'Walker', 'son', 'Andre', 'Jr.', 'who', 'golden', 'gun', 'Ford', 'Fairlane', 'two', 'women', 'dressed', 'Dallas', 'Cowboys', 'cheerleaders', 'back', 'Andres', 'are', 'Yuri', 'best', 'clients', 'worst', 'temptation', ""'ll"", 'deliver', 'anything', 'enemies', 'included', 'exchange', 'guns', 'Lord', 'War', 'occasionally', 'consider', 'Yuri', 'personal', 'life', 'Vitaly', 'partner', 'distaste', 'work', 'self-destruction', 'addiction', 'Leto', 'wild-eyed', 'thing', 'effect', 'Moynihan', 'had', 'looks', 'C', 'skills', 'serving', 'role', 'bland', 'pretty', 'Ava', 'well', 'Unremarkable', 'looks', 'aware', 'conscience', 'comfort', 'aid', 'husband', 'Javert', 'Interpol', 'Jack', 'Valentine', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', '.Yuri', 'crosses', 'key', 'moral', 'lines', 'West', 'Africa', 'fully', 'given', 'over', 'sins', 'doubt', 'attempts', 'go', 'straight', 'when', 'Ava', 'initially', 'last', 'act', 'falters', 'needlessly', 'Vitaly', 'back', 'business', 'fashions', 'cynical', 'unlikely', 'anti-climax', 'Yuri', 'Valentine', 'shift', 'debate', 'charming', 'villain', 'system', 'existence', 'Ever', 'dutiful', 'liberal', 'film', 'Lord', 'War', 'tacks', 'postscript', 'good', 'very', 'bad', 'UN', 'Security', 'Council', ""'ll"", 'better', 'remember', 'scene', 'where', 'Yuri', 'around', 'Liberia', 'discover', 'two', 'growling', 'hyenas', 'fitting', 'company']",N/A

952897,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,B000BYA5G4,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 2]","Perhaps my five-star rating for Nicolas Cage's ""Lord of War"" has to do with exceeding expectations.  I haven't been a big fan of much of Cage's recent action-hero work, and I didn't have high hopes for this latest effort.  What could the same guy who has lately focused on dreck like ""National Treasure,"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds,"" and ""Windtalkers"" have to say about the world of gun trafficking.Fortunately, Cage has a heck of a lot to say about it, and it's obvious that he's pretty steamed.  Using an intelligent, informed, and sarcastic tone reminiscent of David O. Russell's ""Three Kings,"" ""Lord of War"" dives into the cynical, mercenary world of international gun trafficking.From a bravura opening credit sequence that follows a bullet through the manufacturing process to shipping to the brain of a young African combatant, ""Lord of War"" makes no bones about its dark subject matter.  Indeed, ""Lord of War"" has been criticized for being a heavy-handed film.  That may be true, but many great movies hit hard.  Why should a movie about gun-running be any different?Cage stars as Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian emigrant whose family lives in anonymous mediocrity in ""Little Odessa,"" the Ukranian enclave near Queens in the early 1980s.  Witness to a Russian mob hit job, Orlov has an epiphany when he sees the hundreds of bullet casings left on the floor by the assassins' weapons -- why can't I sell these things?The major point this movie makes is that for all the headlines grabbed by nuclear weapons and arms treaties, ""the real weapon of mass destruction"" is the AK-47 and similar small arms.  These weapons are more prevalent in and responsible for the cesspools of the world (such as Liberia under Baptiste, a locale that the movie somewhat revels in) than any nuclear warhead.Using a gift for business and family connections (an uncle is a military hero and high-ranking officer in the Soviet army), Orlov starts from nothing and becomes one of the world's leading arms dealers.  The 1990s were a dream opportunity for the ambitious arms dealer, as the collapsed Soviet Union had billions in military hardware sitting around, but nobody was minding the store.  And war in the Balkans and especially Africa made sure there were hot markets everywhere.  Soon, Orlov has it all - millions of dollars, a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), and one of those Manahattan apartments that reek of success.""Lord of War"" follows a somewhat conventional rags-to-riches-to-loss-of-soul plotline, but there are many twists along the way.  Sure, there are some developments you can see coming (one shot lingers way too long on a vehicle, giving you a clue that it's going to blow up in a couple of seconds . . . which it does), and let's just concede that Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto do not look like siblings.But let's not deny that ""Lord of War"" has some original, intelligent moments.  Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet.  He switches the identity of a cargo ship as Interpol agents (led by an earnest Ethan Hawke) swoop in, and he disposes of an entire planeload of small arms in Africa just before Hawke shows up again.  This scene is followed by a masterpiece, as an entire cargo plane gets dismantled by local scavengers in less than 24 hours.  ""Lord of War"" looks and feels authentic, and that authenticity leaves a cold pit in your stomach long after its cynical and surprising ending.If nothing else, Cage's effort in ""Lord of War"" has reminded me that he has been in so many lower-profile gems, such as ""Adaptation,"" ""Bringing Out the Dead,"" and of course, ""Leaving Las Vegas.""  George Clooney once said that he got involved with the atrocious ""Batman"" franchise (atrocious before ""Batman Begins"" came along, that is) because if he made a big blockbuster, the studios would let him make ""little movies"" like ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""Syriana.""  I guess that excuses Cage's involvement in ""Gone in 60 Seconds.""

It soars high above those gripes with a compelling tale well told, some top-notch acting, and a gripping script peppered with a million rent-a-quotes.The theme had me at Hello: a biopic of a gunrunner's meteoric rise to the top of the global arms race, and his inevitable slide thereof, although its final suit is not buttoned quite so neatly. The sinister trade of glocks and AK-47s is often ignored by popular media in favor of seemingly bigger pies like air force jets and nuclear scuds, but as a matter of fact these little handheld weapons account for more bloodbaths around the world than all other alternatives combined.The little revolutions they foster in unglamoruous corners of the world such as the Balkans or northern Africa are seldom televized, so a film so palatable and entertaining serves a very respectable purpose despite playing on the fringes of moral preachiness. In that sense, its punches may sometimes be predictable, but why not -- given the brutality of the world it depicts, it is all eminently forgiveable. A clever undertone of timely black comedy only helps matters along.You know you have seen something special if you ruminate on it for days afterward, and this chilling, provocative, enlightening production causes that in spades.

Along the way, he accumulates a trophy wife (beautifully played by Bridget Moynahan), his brother (played by Jared Leto) becomes a drug addict, he becomes rich beyond his wildest dreams, and he acquires a mortal enemy in a persistent Interpol agent, played by Ethan Hawke.It is not an understatement to say that Yuri goes through cataclysmic changes, and loses his soul and humanity along the way. As amoral a creature as we have seen in recent films, he can make excuses and has an answer for everything he does. Cage plays him first as an ambitious hustler who gets in over his head, then as a savvy professional, and finally, as an amoral, venal, megalomaniac who only cares about himself and his business. Everything else is to be managed, lied to, and avoided.Andrew Niccol has become quite savvy at writing and/or directing films that make very adept and pointed social commentary with films like Gattaca, The Truman Show, The Terminal, and Simone. But he may have topped himself with this film, which take a hard look at the buying and selling of arms like any other commodity.

His first deal is like, ""The first time you have sex. You don't know what you are doing, but it is exciting, and ends way too quickly."" Helped by his brother [Jared Leto] Orlov goes on to start selling more guns to countries that are at war with other countries because that is where the big money is in selling guns.The movie is styllish and is fast paced in lots of scenes as Orlov goes to different areas in the world, from Russia to Africa, to South America. He eventually reaches the top of the mountain and becomes very well known by war lords, has lots of one night stands with women, and not to mention he also becomes very rich. How rich? He rented out a hotel just so he could trap a beautiful model [Bridget Monayhan], his dream girl, and eventually charm her into marrying him.However like all good things there is an equal level of bad things such as; Orlov's brother as a cocaine addict, even running away with a kilo of cocaine and going crazy in a third world country. His wife has no idea what he does for a living, and like Cage's character says, ""It's not the double life that you live that gets you, it's the fourth, fifth, and sixth lives that will.""Ethan Hawke is also in the movie as an interpol agent whose sole purpose of living it seems is to bring Orlov down. The first scene we see Hawke's character is when Orlov is on a freighter with M-16's and has to cover the illegal guns with thousands of potatoes that don't exactly smell like a field of fresh flowers in the warm sun.The movie does have a lot of scenes not for younger viewers involving women, as well as a lot of violence and language. Some smaller plot lines include Orlov meeting a Liberian dictator [Eamonn Walker] whose son is just as ruthless as his father, holding his trademarked solid gold AK-47 with him wherever he goes.There aren't many extras for this DVD, besides seeing trailers for the movie and subtitles.

952905,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,B000BYA5G4,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[0, 2]","Director:  Andrew NiccolCast:  Nicholas Cage, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan, Jeanne-Pierre Nshanian, Ian Holm, Sammi Rotibi.Running Time:  122 minutesRated R for strong violence, drug use, language and sexuality.Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost. Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner. The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world. He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries. He is tracked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.  Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detoxication. Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence. His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law.""War"" is crowded with crisp, imaginative visuals, which Niccol (""Gattaca,"" ""Simone"") mounts with unusual aplomb. Following Yuri through his 20-year journey as he rises from common criminal to respected trafficker, Niccol and his production crew take every occasion to show off some potent visual flair, padded with terrific CG work. One of the more striking moments of the film is sitting with a handcuffed Yuri in the desert, as he watches, through time-lapse photography, the immediate dismantling by the African locals of the cargo plane that he arrived on. ""War"" is a customary journey from poverty to criminal opulence, but Niccol's attention to detail perks up the screenplay, and constantly strengthens the ideas that he's frantically (emphasis on frantically) trying to communicate.  The casting of Nicolas Cage also aids Niccol's blueprint for ""War."" Back in dynamic mode after sleepwalking through ""National Treasure,"" Cage coolly plays Yuri's rise to prominence, always making sure to underline his professionalism, loyalty, and cancerous doubt whenever he can. Though backed by a fine supporting cast, this is Cage's film, and he lives up to the promise of the role beautifully, skillfully weaving through conflict and opportunity like a used car salesman, but burdened with the soul of a pacifist. It's a complex role, daring the actor to play a greedy scumbag with sympathetic leanings and Cage is one of the few actors around who can pull off that treacherous character structure.  ""Lord of War"" may irritate some people as there isn't a clear story, and the characters serve more as a way to portray the movie's themes than add any emotional weight to the proceedings. The characters do have their moments, however; and a scene that sees Cage having his hand forced by one of his customers expertly portrays the character's attitude and the reason why 'Evil prevails'. Yuri Orlov doesn't want to get his hands dirty; but he's happy to profit from the people that don't mind dirtying theirs. Despite not being a film about characters, Lord of War definitely belongs to its main star.  An adequate attempt at highlighting one of the most underappreciated and unknown travesties of world government and crime; however, a slowly-paced, underdeveloped tale that could have been much more entertaining and resounding.",3,Lord of War  (2005),1138406400,"01 28, 2006",2006,4246,"['Director', 'Andrew', 'NiccolCast', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'Jeanne-Pierre', 'Nshanian', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'Sammi', 'Rotibi.Running', 'Time', '122', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'strong', 'violence', 'drug', 'use', 'language', 'sexuality.Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'brother', 'Vitaly', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'immigrate', 'US', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'parents', 'Shake', 'Tukhmanyan', 'Jean-Pierre', 'Nshanian', 'who', 'have', 'posed', 'Jews', 'escape', 'Ukraine', '1980', 'Glasnost', 'Yuri', 'bright', 'gunrunning', 'lucrative', 'business', 'first', 'tiny', 'success', 'gang', 'infested', 'Little', 'Odessa', 'dreamy-eyed', 'brother', 'be', 'partner', 'business', 'exponentially', 'Yuri', 'best', 'customers', 'are', 'countries', 'war', 'time', 'wealthy', 'married', 'dream', 'sweetheart', 'Ava', 'Bridget', 'Moynahan', 'one', 'more', 'successful', 'gunrunners', 'world', 'buys', 'weapons', 'stockpiled', 'American', 'ordnances', 'US', ""'finished"", 'war', 'Eastern', 'European', 'African', 'South', 'American', 'revolutionaries', 'tracked', 'Jack', 'Valentine', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'who', 'role', 'government', 'agent', 'determined', 'stop', 'Yuri', 'dispersal', 'deadly', 'weapons', 'result', 'needless', 'deaths', 'when', 'disseminated', 'countries', 'throes', 'political', 'change', 'Yuri', 'first', 'business', 'care', 'deeply', 'wife', 'child', 'Vitaly', 'entry', 'world', 'wealth', 'soon', 'squandered', 'cocaine', 'addiction', 'requiring', 'frequent', 'detoxication', 'Yuri', 'not', 'mean', 'spirited', 'man', 'business', 'just', 'salesmanship', 'items', 'huge', 'demand', 'not', 'see', 'perpetrator', 'violence', 'life', 'moments', 'compassion', 'many', 'moments', 'financial', 'success', 'moments', 'pride', 'being', 'gifted', 'gun-runner', 'become', 'moments', 'introspection', 'dictators', 'revolutionaries', 'fellow', 'gunrunners', 'law', 'War', 'crowded', 'crisp', 'imaginative', 'visuals', 'Niccol', 'Gattaca', 'Simone', 'mounts', 'unusual', 'aplomb', 'Following', '20-year', 'journey', 'common', 'criminal', 'respected', 'trafficker', 'Niccol', 'production', 'crew', 'take', 'occasion', 'show', 'off', 'potent', 'visual', 'flair', 'padded', 'terrific', 'CG', 'work', 'One', 'more', 'striking', 'moments', 'film', 'sitting', 'handcuffed', 'Yuri', 'desert', 'time-lapse', 'photography', 'immediate', 'dismantling', 'African', 'locals', 'cargo', 'plane', 'arrived', 'War', 'customary', 'journey', 'poverty', 'criminal', 'opulence', 'Niccol', 'attention', 'detail', 'perks', 'screenplay', 'constantly', 'ideas', 'frantically', 'emphasis', 'frantically', 'trying', 'communicate', 'casting', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'also', 'Niccol', 'blueprint', 'War', 'Back', 'dynamic', 'mode', 'sleepwalking', 'National', 'Treasure', 'Cage', 'coolly', 'Yuri', 'rise', 'prominence', 'always', 'making', 'sure', 'underline', 'professionalism', 'loyalty', 'cancerous', 'doubt', 'can', 'backed', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Cage', 'film', 'up', 'promise', 'role', 'beautifully', 'skillfully', 'weaving', 'conflict', 'opportunity', 'used', 'car', 'salesman', 'burdened', 'soul', 'pacifist', 'complex', 'role', 'daring', 'actor', 'play', 'greedy', 'scumbag', 'sympathetic', 'leanings', 'Cage', 'one', 'few', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'pull', 'off', 'treacherous', 'character', 'structure', 'Lord', 'War', 'may', 'irritate', 'people', ""n't"", 'clear', 'story', 'characters', 'serve', 'more', 'way', 'portray', 'movie', 'themes', 'add', 'emotional', 'weight', 'proceedings', 'characters', 'do', 'have', 'moments', 'however', 'scene', 'Cage', 'having', 'hand', 'forced', 'one', 'customers', 'expertly', 'character', 'attitude', 'reason', 'why', ""'Evil"", 'prevails', 'Yuri', 'Orlov', ""n't"", 'want', 'get', 'hands', 'dirty', 'happy', 'profit', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'dirtying', 'not', 'being', 'film', 'characters', 'Lord', 'War', 'definitely', 'main', 'star', 'adequate', 'attempt', 'highlighting', 'one', 'most', 'underappreciated', 'unknown', 'travesties', 'world', 'government', 'crime', 'however', 'slowly-paced', 'underdeveloped', 'tale', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'entertaining', 'resounding']",N/A
952906,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B000BYA5G4,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[4, 5]","I'm going to borrow an analogy used in the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for a moment. When Nicholas Cage comes up to bat, he frequently hits singles or misses, but when he hits a homerun, it is usually out of the ballpark. Cage has certainly made his share of crappy (""Gone in 60 Seconds"") or mediocre films (""The Family Man""), but he has also, occasionally, made really good films. Films that he should be proud of. Films that would do a Nicholas Cage Film Festival proud. ""Lord of War"" is such a film.Directed by Andrew Niccol (the writer of ""The Truman Show"" and the writer/director of the underappreciated ""Gattaca"" and the rightfully forgotten ""Simone""), ""War"" is a dark comedy that falters only once or twice. This coupled with a terrific performance by Cage make it a memorable film. Whether it becomes a remembered film has yet to be seen.Yuri Orlov (Cage) and his brother Vitale (Jared Leto) are second generation Ukrainian immigrants helping their Catholic parents run a Kosher restaurant in the Little Odessa neighborhood of New York. One day, Yuri witnesses a gang shootout and realizes that money can be had from selling guns. He talks Vitale into partnering with him and they start a business taking them into war zones across the globe. As the money rolls in, each spends on their vice of choice; Vitale starts snorting profit through his nose and Yuri romances Eve (Bridget Moynahan), a famous model from the old neighborhood. After they are married, the Cold War ends and business really picks up. A zealous ATF agent (Ethan Hawke) sets his sights on Yuri.Reportedly based on true events, ""War"" is a fast-paced, darkly comic look at a man we should loathe.Cage's performance is great. The film begins with Yuri breaking the fourth wall; addressing the audience from the screen, talking about his business and his morals (""I never sold guns to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, just at that time, his checks were always bouncing."") setting the tone for his character and the film. Throughout the film, Yuri frequently provides narration which is light and breezy, a brilliant counterpoint to the subject matter. This also helps to make his character more memorable, because what he says is usually completely at odds with what we should be feeling or experiencing. Somehow, and I'm not entirely sure how he does it, Cage makes Yuri a sympathetic guy. Yuri is a drug runner who sells weapons and helps keep wars going so he can make more money. He occasionally uses drugs and also cheats on his wife, Eve. Yet, we care for him. When he gets into dangerous situations, we want him to get out safely. How did Cage accomplish this? Part of it is that we see him in dangerous situations. Other people die. The danger is there. Things happen to him. He isn't completely unaffected either. Because we feel for him, we laugh at ourselves for being taken in by this character which in turn adds to the dark humor.Niccol manages to tell a political story, without preaching. We learn or witness as the story unfolds. The beginning sequence, a terrific point of view shot of the journey of a single bullet from manufacture to use also helps to quickly establish what Niccol is trying to do. He uses Yuri as his mouthpiece, serious at times and completely unaffected at others. Because we are watching the events through this character's eyes, it would be impossible for the film to be very preachy. Yuri wouldn't stand around and preach about this or that, so Niccol doesn't either. Even though Yuri frequently makes statements about his impartiality to one conflict or the other, his statements and what he witnesses inform us. Parts of the story are serious and others are satirical. Niccol maintains this blend well throughout faltering only a few times in the last act.The supporting cast is good. Jared Leto is convincing as Vitale, Yuri's coked out, out of control younger brother. Bridget Moynahan is also good as Eve, Yuri's wife, who doesn't face the truth until forced to. Ian Holm makes a brief appearance as an old school gunrunner, Yuri's main competition.Ethan Hawke's role as Agent Valentine is little more than a glorified cameo. Hawke starred in Niccol's first film ""Gattaca"" and I get the sense they wanted to work together again, no matter the project. It seems as though Valentine is meant to be the character who reflects was we should be feeling, the conscience of the audience. In his few moments on screen, he says what we should say; he displays the disgust we should feel. But the character is, as mentioned, only on screen for a brief period. Thankfully. If the character did work, providing a Yang to balance Cage's Ying, the film would lose a significant amount of its dark humor. It's a small role and odd that they would use his name in the advertisements.""Lord of War"" is not a perfect film, but it is a memorable one and it contains a great performance from Nicholas Cage.",4,Maybe 4 1/2 stars.

Lord of War didn't make as much money or garner as much critical acclaim as the other movies on the list, but it was certainly a better movie.Nicholas Cage turns in one of his most nuanced performances since Leaving Las Vegas as a arms dealer who started out selling ammunition to the gangsters in his neighborhood and quickly rose to the international stage with the end of the Cold War. His international dealing in all the war zones from Lebananon to Liberia gives us some of the best camera work this side of Brokeback Mountain. Cage's dry one liners keep the movie going even as he reveals himself to be a despicable creep (but with the African death squads that buy his weapons, he is comparitively decent) who even attracts the moral disgust of other arms dealers represented by Ian Holm who actually have an agenda in their business practices. Cage's wit in delivering the lines like ""I didn't supply Osama Bin Laden, not out of moral reasons. He was bouncing checks at the time."" keep you from outright hating him.Jared Leto provides the moral center of the movie as the troubled brother who initially helps Nicholas Cage, but can't handle the guilt from being responsible for so many deaths. In another world, this movie would be Jared Leto's story and he is certainly proving himself up for the task of carrying his own movie. Ethan Hawke spins his wheels as the ATF agent out to nail Cage, but he's largely in the background.Despite the way the plot apes Goodfellas, you never feel like you are watching a morality tale. Cage is in a much more dangerous business than being a gangster and his choices sustain and doom him.Actually the movie's opening sequence of the path of the bullet from factory to crates to boxes to boy's head tells you all you need to know about this movie. It's fun. It's witty and ironic, but ultimately it is dealing with some very serious issues and the serious consequences of being alive in a post-Colonial, post-Cold War era in which no side is clear, but the guns are in ready supply.",5,Amazing Movie,1137542400,"01 18, 2006",2006,2211,"['2005', 'seemed', 'be', 'year', 'when', 'directors', 'jumped', 'soap', 'boxes', 'said', 'Pay', 'Attention', 'world', 'overtly', 'political', 'movies', 'Munich', 'Syriana', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'Lord', 'War', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'as', 'much', 'money', 'garner', 'much', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'other', 'movies', 'list', 'was', 'certainly', 'better', 'movie.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'one', 'most', 'nuanced', 'performances', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'arms', 'dealer', 'who', 'started', 'out', 'selling', 'ammunition', 'gangsters', 'neighborhood', 'quickly', 'rose', 'international', 'stage', 'end', 'Cold', 'War', 'international', 'dealing', 'war', 'zones', 'Lebananon', 'Liberia', 'best', 'camera', 'work', 'side', 'Brokeback', 'Mountain', 'Cage', 'dry', 'one', 'liners', 'keep', 'movie', 'going', 'even', 'be', 'despicable', 'creep', 'African', 'death', 'squads', 'buy', 'weapons', 'comparitively', 'decent', 'who', 'even', 'moral', 'disgust', 'other', 'arms', 'dealers', 'represented', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'who', 'actually', 'have', 'agenda', 'business', 'practices', 'Cage', 'wit', 'delivering', 'lines', 'did', ""n't"", 'supply', 'Osama', 'Bin', 'Laden', 'not', 'moral', 'reasons', 'was', 'bouncing', 'checks', 'time', 'keep', 'outright', 'hating', 'him.Jared', 'Leto', 'moral', 'center', 'movie', 'troubled', 'brother', 'who', 'initially', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'ca', ""n't"", 'handle', 'guilt', 'being', 'responsible', 'so', 'many', 'deaths', 'world', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'story', 'certainly', 'proving', 'task', 'carrying', 'own', 'movie', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'wheels', 'ATF', 'agent', 'nail', 'Cage', 'largely', 'background.Despite', 'way', 'plot', 'Goodfellas', 'never', 'feel', 'are', 'watching', 'morality', 'tale', 'Cage', 'much', 'more', 'dangerous', 'business', 'being', 'gangster', 'choices', 'sustain', 'doom', 'him.Actually', 'movie', 'opening', 'sequence', 'path', 'bullet', 'factory', 'crates', 'boxes', 'boy', 'head', 'tells', 'all', 'need', 'know', 'movie', 'fun', 'witty', 'ironic', 'ultimately', 'dealing', 'very', 'serious', 'issues', 'serious', 'consequences', 'being', 'alive', 'post-Colonial', 'post-Cold', 'War', 'era', 'side', 'clear', 'guns', 'are', 'ready', 'supply']",N/A

A Liberian dictator gleefully hands Yuri a gun and tells him to fire away, but Yuri is terrified. The dictator takes Yuri's hands as if he were helping a child and helps him fire, blowing the other man's brains out. Yuri may have sold millions of weapons to people all over the world, but he has never fired a single shot.This was Lord of War's best scene, a glaring standout in a film soaked with mediocre, gloomy cynicism. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol desperately wants to say something about the arms trade that gives people in third-world countries the means to butcher each other, but his obvious lack of answers infects the entire screenplay. By the end, Niccol's desperation is palatable as the final ten minutes spirals into an entirely different message than the 110 that preceded it.Growing up a Ukrainian immigrant in New York, Yuri works at his father's restaurant. After witnessing a gang shooting, he realizes that he should sell something that everyone needs other than food. He works his way from selling Uzi's to thugs to bringing shiploads of AK-47's to dictators. Though a relentless Interpool agent (Ethan Hawke, playing self as a nave doofus) hounds him at times, Yuri finds the arms trade to be eerily lucrative.An atheist-existentialist, Yuri never so much as shrugs at the suggestion that his actions are wrong. He hurls heavy handed lines like ""You know who's going to inherit the world? Arms dealers. Because everyone else is too busy killing each other,"" every thirty seconds or so, in case we forget that he possesses a cynical world-view. He traipses around the world, narrating in monotone about how much profitable arms sales are, people killing each other, not caring, etc.Nearly every line and character exists solely for the purpose of illustrating a message Niccol isn't even certain of. Never does the film make a serious attempt at balancing the gloom and doom. Yuri's trophy wife lives the high life off his blood money, then dubiously insists he quit. Yuri brings coke-head brother (Jared Leto) along for no reason other than that the screenplay needs a martyr. And in case we didn't think Yuri was bad enough, the vicious Liberian murders his underlings on a whim. There have been Bond films with more layered characters, and I've seen a few with Roger Moore.Lord of War gets a few shots into the 10-ring with some black humor and appropriately grim photography, but results in a total misfire. Someone should send Andrew Niccol a memo explaining that relentless cynicism unopposed results in mere whining; Lord of War whines so loud it could be heard over a volley of the machine guns Yuri uses to pay for his limo.",2,Lord of War misfires with muddled message,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,2749,"['Yuri', 'Orlov', 'Nicolas', 'Cage', 'face', 'face', 'worst', 'enemy', 'tied', 'chair', 'Liberian', 'dictator', 'gleefully', 'gun', 'fire', 'away', 'Yuri', 'terrified', 'dictator', 'Yuri', 'hands', 'were', 'helping', 'child', 'fire', 'blowing', 'other', 'man', 'brains', 'out', 'Yuri', 'may', 'have', 'sold', 'millions', 'weapons', 'people', 'world', 'never', 'fired', 'single', 'shot.This', 'was', 'Lord', 'War', 'best', 'scene', 'glaring', 'standout', 'film', 'soaked', 'mediocre', 'gloomy', 'cynicism', 'Writer/Director', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'desperately', 'say', 'something', 'arms', 'trade', 'people', 'third-world', 'countries', 'means', 'butcher', 'other', 'obvious', 'lack', 'answers', 'infects', 'entire', 'screenplay', 'end', 'Niccol', 'desperation', 'palatable', 'final', 'ten', 'minutes', 'spirals', 'entirely', 'different', 'message', '110', 'preceded', 'it.Growing', 'up', 'Ukrainian', 'immigrant', 'New', 'York', 'Yuri', 'father', 'restaurant', 'witnessing', 'gang', 'shooting', 'should', 'sell', 'something', 'everyone', 'other', 'food', 'way', 'selling', 'Uzi', 'thugs', 'bringing', 'shiploads', 'AK-47', 'dictators', 'relentless', 'Interpool', 'agent', 'Ethan', 'Hawke', 'playing', 'nave', 'doofus', 'times', 'Yuri', 'arms', 'trade', 'be', 'eerily', 'lucrative.An', 'atheist-existentialist', 'Yuri', 'never', 'so', 'much', 'shrugs', 'suggestion', 'actions', 'are', 'wrong', 'hurls', 'heavy', 'handed', 'lines', 'know', 'who', 'going', 'inherit', 'world', 'Arms', 'dealers', 'everyone', 'else', 'too', 'busy', 'killing', 'other', 'thirty', 'so', 'case', 'forget', 'cynical', 'world-view', 'world', 'narrating', 'monotone', 'how', 'much', 'profitable', 'arms', 'sales', 'are', 'people', 'killing', 'other', 'not', 'caring', 'etc.Nearly', 'line', 'character', 'exists', 'solely', 'purpose', 'illustrating', 'message', 'Niccol', ""n't"", 'even', 'certain', 'Never', 'film', 'make', 'serious', 'attempt', 'balancing', 'gloom', 'doom', 'Yuri', 'trophy', 'wife', 'high', 'life', 'blood', 'money', 'then', 'dubiously', 'quit', 'Yuri', 'coke-head', 'brother', 'Jared', 'Leto', 'reason', 'other', 'screenplay', 'martyr', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'Yuri', 'was', 'bad', 'enough', 'vicious', 'Liberian', 'murders', 'underlings', 'whim', 'have', 'been', 'Bond', 'films', 'more', 'layered', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'few', 'Roger', 'Moore.Lord', 'War', 'few', 'shots', '10-ring', 'black', 'humor', 'appropriately', 'grim', 'photography', 'results', 'total', 'misfire', 'Someone', 'should', 'send', 'Andrew', 'Niccol', 'memo', 'explaining', 'relentless', 'cynicism', 'unopposed', 'results', 'mere', 'whining', 'Lord', 'War', 'whines', 'so', 'loud', 'could', 'be', 'heard', 'volley', 'machine', 'Yuri', 'pay', 'limo']",N/A
952911,A2Q4XG9UABH3S3,B000BYA5G4,"Torquemada ""dunlopilo""","[2, 3]","I saw almost back to back the Flightplan (with Jodie Foster), The Weatherman"", and this one, both with Nicholas Cage as main actor.These are three very different films, but ""Lord of War"" was the best in my opinion. Despite being a ""low budget film"", as the producers tell us in the extra features on disc 2, it really brings up interesting issues that most people would probably not have thought of.I found this film to be excellent. The acting is top of the line. Those who know Nicholas Cage will not be disappointed. Those who don't know him can watch this film before watching ""Leaving Las Vegas"", then ""Family man"", a sharp comedy, and maybe ""Gone in sixty seconds"". That way, you will have a good sample of this actor's talents, which keeps improving, film after film. Cage's brother in this film also does some great acting (keep an eye on this actor). The rest of the cast is also very acceptable in their own roles, especially the Liberian dictator. As to the special effects, they are perfect. See the landing of the Antonov on the dust road for instance. It is shot with real people, a real aircraft, and an almost real dust road. Nothing overdone, nothing too computerized, but bang, effective !The shooting of the film is also impeccable, showing the journey of a bullet at the very beginning of the film (it ends up in a young boy's head), a vulture attacking a dead body, tanks lined up during a negotiation between cage and a seller, the plane sequence mentioned before, as well as the constant contrasts New York VS. Black Africa.Do not miss the dark humour that pops up here and there; for instance, Cage reminding the dictator that it is bloodbath, and not bath of blood, or that you say warlord, and not lord of war (and maybe risking his life by daring to contradict the ""client"").  Or, during the landing of the Antonov, Cage telling the pilot that he is the best and can do it (narrating to us that he actually wasn't, that the pilot finished 35th out of 36 at the Moscow school of pilots). Or the lack of culinary talent of Cage's brother, which ends up being tragi-comical.The film is also well done because the of the loops it goes into. The brother keeps on getting back into his bad habits, Cage gives up the trading before falling again, the interpol agent keeps on helplessly chasing Cage, and the film ends up right the way it started. With a shot of tons of bullets on the ground. That is probably the main message : things don't change, and even if you try, there is too much money and ""interests"" involved. The gray market (and even the official one) of weapons sale is here to stay... The sad part ? Cage reminds it several times : he doesn't do anything illegal... because there are loopholes in most legislations. And because the main countries involved in this as sellers are the five that are on the UN security council...A couple of final words :  (1) the extra dvd is very interesting; it talks about the weapons industry (who gets what and how and where it goes), you get explanations of the special effects, you get a sort of catalogue of the main weapons sough after on the market, and you get an explanation of the difficulties the filmmakers had to overcome (for instance, it ended up being cheaper for them to buy 3000 Kalashnikovs than making fake ones, or that the Antonov used in the film belonged to an actual weapon dealer, who lent it to them !) (2) Don't watch this film with children or sensitive people. It has very strong sequences (children executed somewhere in Palestine, the dictator blowing one of his bodyguards head by surprise, a camp of refugees in black Africa being cut to pieces with machetes). That doesn't change anything to the rating though. It is an excellent film !",4,The loop...,1141776000,"03 8, 2006",2006,3740,"['saw', 'almost', 'back', 'back', 'Flightplan', 'Jodie', 'Foster', 'Weatherman', 'one', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'main', 'actor.These', 'are', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'Lord', 'War', 'was', 'best', 'opinion', 'being', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'producers', 'tell', 'extra', 'features', 'disc', '2', 'really', 'up', 'interesting', 'issues', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'have', 'thought', 'of.I', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'excellent', 'acting', 'top', 'line', 'who', 'know', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'disappointed', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'watch', 'film', 'watching', 'Leaving', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'then', 'Family', 'man', 'sharp', 'comedy', 'maybe', 'Gone', 'sixty', 'seconds', 'way', 'will', 'have', 'good', 'sample', 'actor', 'talents', 'improving', 'film', 'film', 'Cage', 'brother', 'film', 'also', 'great', 'acting', 'keep', 'eye', 'actor', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'very', 'acceptable', 'own', 'roles', 'especially', 'Liberian', 'dictator', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'perfect', 'See', 'landing', 'Antonov', 'dust', 'road', 'instance', 'shot', 'real', 'people', 'real', 'aircraft', 'almost', 'real', 'dust', 'road', 'Nothing', 'overdone', 'nothing', 'too', 'computerized', 'bang', 'effective', 'shooting', 'film', 'also', 'impeccable', 'showing', 'journey', 'bullet', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'up', 'young', 'boy', 'head', 'vulture', 'attacking', 'dead', 'body', 'tanks', 'lined', 'up', 'negotiation', 'cage', 'seller', 'plane', 'sequence', 'mentioned', 'before', 'as', 'well', 'constant', 'New', 'York', 'VS.', 'Black', 'Africa.Do', 'not', 'miss', 'dark', 'humour', 'here', 'there', 'instance', 'Cage', 'reminding', 'dictator', 'bloodbath', 'not', 'bath', 'blood', 'say', 'warlord', 'not', 'lord', 'war', 'maybe', 'risking', 'life', 'daring', 'contradict', 'client', 'landing', 'Antonov', 'Cage', 'telling', 'pilot', 'best', 'can', 'do', 'narrating', 'actually', 'was', ""n't"", 'pilot', 'finished', '35th', '36', 'Moscow', 'school', 'pilots', 'lack', 'culinary', 'talent', 'Cage', 'brother', 'up', 'being', 'tragi-comical.The', 'film', 'also', 'well', 'done', 'loops', 'brother', 'getting', 'back', 'bad', 'habits', 'Cage', 'up', 'trading', 'falling', 'again', 'interpol', 'agent', 'helplessly', 'chasing', 'Cage', 'film', 'up', 'right', 'way', 'started', 'shot', 'tons', 'bullets', 'ground', 'probably', 'main', 'message', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'even', 'try', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'interests', 'involved', 'gray', 'market', 'even', 'official', 'one', 'weapons', 'sale', 'here', 'stay', 'sad', 'part', 'Cage', 'several', 'times', ""n't"", 'do', 'anything', 'illegal', 'are', 'loopholes', 'most', 'legislations', 'main', 'countries', 'involved', 'sellers', 'are', 'five', 'are', 'UN', 'security', 'council', 'A', 'couple', 'final', 'words', '1', 'extra', 'dvd', 'very', 'interesting', 'weapons', 'industry', 'who', 'what', 'how', 'where', 'get', 'explanations', 'special', 'effects', 'get', 'sort', 'catalogue', 'main', 'weapons', 'sough', 'market', 'get', 'explanation', 'difficulties', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'overcome', 'instance', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'cheaper', 'buy', '3000', 'Kalashnikovs', 'making', 'fake', 'ones', 'Antonov', 'used', 'film', 'belonged', 'actual', 'weapon', 'dealer', 'who', 'lent', '2', 'Do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'film', 'children', 'sensitive', 'people', 'very', 'strong', 'sequences', 'children', 'executed', 'somewhere', 'Palestine', 'dictator', 'blowing', 'one', 'bodyguards', 'head', 'surprise', 'camp', 'refugees', 'black', 'Africa', 'being', 'cut', 'pieces', 'machetes', ""n't"", 'change', 'anything', 'rating', 'excellent', 'film']",N/A
952912,A2NVQZ4Y7Y0J1R,B000BYA5G4,Traveler,"[6, 8]","After sitting through (suffering through, really) the last installment of Star Wars and the recent King Kong, with all their excessive CGI, poor character development and bad acting, I had the unexpected pleasure of seeing Lord of War on pay-per-view.Lord might have some detail inaccuracies (e.g. specific aspects of being an arms dealer or the function of Interpol), but it makes up for it in being dead on accurate when it comes to focusing like a laser on moral hypocrisy.  Republican president Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us fifty years ago that the military-industrial complex would threaten this country and our world.  While we've been sleeping this is exactly what has been happening.Lord of War takes this fact by focusing on a single man, Yuri, (played by Nicolas Cage) who is completely devoid of any moral concerns.  For example, in one scene a dictator - a potential buyer - uses one of Yuri's brand new weapons to kill a nearby dallying soldier.  Yuri screams in outrage and the dictator takes pause.  How does Yuri dare challenge his absolute power to do as he pleases?  Yuri then explains that he has now used the weapon and must now purchase it.  The dictator laughs and Yuri's character establishes his credibility to both the dictator and to us, the audience.  It's all about the product - the money - and ethical concerns are irrelevant.The last minute of the movie is an earth shattering statement about how the western world - those responsible for keeping peace and security in the world - are a central part of the problem of violence and war in this world.  Just like the excellent Three Kings, Lord of War is destined to be a classic satirical statement about our world.  While it might now have done well at the box office, it will surely be greatly admired years from now.In any other year Lord of War would be a moderately well made movie.  In this season of films over filled with CGI and characters we could care less about, it easily ranks as one the best of 2005.",5,"Biting satire in the vein of ""Three Kings.""

952914,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000BYA5G4,Tsuyoshi,"[0, 5]","The theme of the film - international arms dealer -- is a very serious one, but unfortunately it was too much for writer/director Andrew Niccol. `Lord of War' claims that the content is based on the actual events, but the important thing is - What part of it?I believe that there is a man like Yuri, Ukrainian-born arms dealer, who finds his unexpected `gift' as gunrunner. The deadpan acting of Nicholas Cage as Yuri makes this fellow more credible than the overwritten script allows for him. Actually, the most intriguing moments of the film come when we see him as businessman whose cool and non-committal attitudes towards politics and moral are curiously attractive. Or repulsive to some of you.And I believe that even this so-called `Death-Merchant' can be a good father, love his wife, and care his drug-addicted brother (Jared Leto). If Andre Niccol says that he actually met the real-life arms dealers, and that he thought them nice people, there is no reason I should not believe what he says. And you will see at the same time that Yuri can sell guns right in front of the possible victims who are going to be killed, and that complexity in his characters makes him all the more intriguing.However, the rest of the film is overloaded with clich&eacute;d items, none of which have a ring of truth. How many times should I write that Interpol (ICPO) never send the investigator (here played by Ethan Hawke)? They may send to or receive the information from each country's police around the world, but never investigate themselves. Or how many times should we see the romance with a beautiful woman when we don't need it? Yuri gets his dream woman Ava (Bridget Moynahan) only to disappoint her. Yuri's brother gets what you know he will get when he reappears in the second half of the film, and so does Yuri's rival in business (Ian Holm). In spite of the good acting, these supporting roles only lessen the reality that the film is supposed to have.The film's weakness can be easily ignored if `Lord of War' is meant to be something entirely fictional. It is not, and the character of Yuri convinces you of the fact.

I don't think it is good enough to be a 3 by some of the other movies I have rated but I don't think it is bad enough to be a 2. So 2 1/2 I guess. I saw the previews of this movie and thought I would check it out. I looked like an interesting premise based on a very interesting subject. I thought that Nicholas Cage did an excellent job as the former Russian immigrant who turned small time arms dealer and then into an major international arms dealer. Again the subject is something that is very intriguing and very interesting but alas the movie just drags. I remember when watching it thinking, ""this is going to be good."" Then, ""this is pretty good"" and then as it went on and on I was thinking, ""man, ok, I wish this thing would wrap up and end."" So somewhere in there it lost me. Jared Leto was accutally pretty good as Cages brother and Cage has a pretty hot wife. The guy that plays the African dictator is great and does a really good job. The movie also shows a lot about the politics and cultures of the African nations that are torn and fed by violence and arms. Also I almost forgot that Ethan Hawke is very good as the ATF guy that is pursuing Cage.

Nicolas Cage portrayed an admittedly cynical and amoral gun runner (Yuri).  The movie could, arguably, be thought of as a capitalist success story in the Horatio Alger tradition.  The movie was full of scenes of gritty realism.  The street scenes in various third world countries and the contrast to the lifestyles of the local ruling despots merit particular mention.  There was unusual cinematography, as well - particularly the ""life of a bullet"" sequence at the beginning of the movie, that ends with the bullet entering a child's brain.However, I found Yuri's wife Ava's betrayal of him to be unrealistic in the extreme.  After all, she had been a dutiful ""trophy wife"" who had been living off of Yuri's so-called ""ill-gotten gains"" for years.  Why would she, all of a sudden, out of the blue, develop a ""conscience""?  It made me wonder, was she having an affair with the cop who was investigating her husband, or what?  Or maybe the authorities were going to charge her as an accessory or even a co-conspirator, and she ""flipped"" to save her own skin.

952918,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B000BYA5G4,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[2, 2]",": The rise and fall (and rise again) of Yuri Orlov arms dealer is the focus of Andrew Niccol's acidic (writer of ""The Truman Show"" and writer-director of ""SimOne"", ""Gattaca"") unfocused blend of satire and action in ""Lord of War"".  Yuri has no hidden agenda beyond making money unlike his rival Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) who lives to influence the way the wind of power blows. Oh and Yuri's also got an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) on his trail as well. Things aren't going so well right now for Yuri even though he's raking in record profits. Recalling Stanley Kubrick's black humor classic Nicholas Cage portrays Yuri as the ultimate salesman-he could be selling pharmaceuticals or a car but he's decided to be ""the merchant of death"".  ""Lord of War"" is a deft mix of action, drama and satire. With actors Jared Leto as Yuri's confused drug dependent younger brother and Bridget Moynahan as his seemingly oblivious wife the film lights up the screen combining brilliant visual motifs with top notch acting, writing and direction. The opening sequence where we follow a bullet from ""birth"" to ""death"" is a riveting powerful sequence.A very nice sharp transfer for ""Lord of War"" the film looks quite good with rich colors and an active 6.1 mix DTS audio mix, a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Ex mix and an audio commentary by writer/director Andrew Niccol on a 2.0 mix. The audio comes across crystal clear.First two criticisms about the product itself not the quality of the film or special features. 1) I hate the packaging of this two disc edition. It looks cheap and sucks big time.  Once you slide out the two disc set from the cardboard sleeve you'll find the two discs housed in a cheap cardboard case with a disc holder glued in the middle. It looks very tacky. The single disc edition at least appears to come in an Amray hardcase. 2) The single disc edition has no extras, zero. This recalls the time when movies were released on DVD a decade ago with just the feature film. This nasty trend didn't start with but was most noticeable with Steven Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"". All major studios stop doing this it confuses consumers (some people who want the editions with extras can't find them or, worse yet, buy the single disc sets and then get upset. It's ticking off the customer. Lion's Gate this is an idiotic move. Don't do it again. If you're going to put out a two disc edition do it right-put in a two disc Amray case WITH a booklet vs. these cheapo looking cardboard containers. Steven Spielberg should have been ashamed and Lion's Gate you should be too.The first disc has two special features. The first is an intelligent and informative commentary track by writer/director Andrew Niccol. Niccol's an intelligent and passionate writer/director. Most of the monologue focuses on production details but there is a good amount of other things discussed as well that Niccol learned during the research for his film. Although Niccol's commentary is intermittent and quiet it's intelligent and focused. The second extra on the first disc is an Easter egg if you click on the Amnesty International logo. Nicholas Cage appears in a plea to prevent the continue sales of arms. He discusses the impact that it has in terms of human life.The second disc of this DVD features most of the special features. The most important one is the documentary """"Making a Killing"""" which takes a look at the true cost of selling arms. These people that do it look at themselves as businessmen but they are, in reality, nothing more than leeches living off of the suffering of humanity. Featuring interviews with William Schultz of Amnesty International and Philip Coyle a Senior Advisor with the World Security Institute. As Coyle points out the U.S. is one of the largest arms sellers and we end up going to war against many of the countries that end up eventually buying many of these killing machines. Dr Sylvester Rowe Executive Director of the United States also appears as narrating documentary footage shot in many of these Third World countries where tin dictators pay for arms to stay in control while their populations starve. It's an informative excellent featurette. We also find out the fate of children in these countries who end up becoming young soldiers and victims of their society. ""Weapons of the Trade"" features a gallery of the various weapons seen in the film, a text history of the weapon and the specs. ""The Making of `Lord of  War'"" is a marvelous behind-the-scenes featurette. We hear comments from director Niccol about what inspired him to make this acidic satire and what attracted the various actors to the project. There's also a photo gallery, trailers for the film and seven deleted scenes that round out the special features on the second disc.Although it's an imperfect film, ""Lord of War"" is still a deft entertaining and acidic satire on the obsession our world has with weapons of destruction. Cage gives a brilliant performance as Yuri the arms dealer and has able support from Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan  and Eamonn Walker as a psychotic despot leader. It's well worth watching although, depending on your political beliefs, you'll be either outraged at Niccol's liberal point of view or delighted to find someone who agrees with you.",4,The man behind

Well, this movie has you caught by the throat from the opening titles and you are so sad to see the thing end!Since everyone else has synopsized the story, I'll just dwell on the fascinating little things such as Orlov's immunity to prosecution when he's finally caught and why.

952920,A3N5XIM9R2OQH0,B000BYA5G4,Wheelchair Assassin,"[9, 12]","In reading about the Third Reich (which I've done quite a bit, even though it's not the most pleasant subject matter), one element I noticed running through many commentaries was that of the banality of evil, referring to the strange tendency of the most ruthless Nazi functionaries to be regular people who went about their jobs the way most of the rest of us do, with little if any thought given to the massive human suffering involved.  Sadly, that's usually the way it is: evil is good at hiding.  The most morally bankrupt people-gansters, tyrants, drug lords, U.S. Senators-generally aren't raving, slobbering maniacs, but instead can often be found hiding behind nice suits and slick smiles.  So it is with Yuri Orlov, the moral vacuum at the center of Andrew Nicol's frequently inspired Lord of War.  This is some excellent political filmmaking: dark, hilarious, and unflinching, with occasional but suitably brutal depictions of violence and general depravity, all framed with Cage's matter-of-fact voice-over narration.This movie basically does for gunrunners what Goodfellas did for gangsters: there's no real plot per se; it just captures several extended snapshots from a life and career spent on the wrong side of the law.  All the basic elements of Martin Scorcese's classic portrayal of Henry Hill's life can be found here-the meteoric rise, the materialistic excess, the twisted characters and violent deaths, the myriad family problems-but Lord of War adds ample doses of the kind of black humor that made Dr. Strangelove and Fight Club such subversive classics.  Moreover, where the power and influence of the Mafia have subsided since the events of Goodfellas transpired, this movie makes clear that the gun trade is still very much alive and well.  As Yuri himself says late in the movie, his work may be evil, but it's a necessary evil, ensuring that business will always be good.Played by Nicolas Cage in the best work I've seen from him next to his dual role in Adaptation (which was some of the best acting I've ever seen from anybody, so I doubt he'll ever top it), Yuri's a friendly enough guy with a nice deadpan sense of humor, capable of compartmentalizing his life to the point where he can sell weapons to the most brutal of dictators under the rationalization that he doesn't control what they do.  Besides, while it may be a dirty job, someone's gotta do it.  Yuri basically just buys enthusiastically into the capitalist notion of getting what he can when he can, without getting caught up in the tangled web of loyalties that characterizes foreign relations.  After all, if people are going to kill each other (and they are) and someone's going to profit from it, he reasons, it might as well be him.  The early going of Lord of War follows Yuri around the world as he sells to anyone, anywhere, anytime (but not to Osama Bin Laden: back in the '80's, his checks frequently bounced).While Yuri himself is resolutely nonpolitical in his endeavors, the movie places his activities squarely within the changing face of world politics as the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union leaves a vacuum that Yuri's only too happy to fill.  Starting with his first sale of an Uzi in New York's heavily Ukrainian Little Odessa, Yuri quickly graduates to wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, hitting it big when his uncle sells him a mother lode of former Red Army stock.  From there it's on to Africa, becoming the arms dealer of choice for a vicious Liberian dictator and his insane son (memorably portrayed by Eamonn Walker and some guy whose name I can't remember, respectively).  Lord of War gives us a look at some of the nuts and bolts of arms dealing, focusing heavily on Yuri's efforts to stay one step ahead of driven Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke, all righteous indignation and selflessness, at least on the surface), but the movie is more a character study than anything else, examining the traits that enable someone to profit from the enabling of war and mass murder (to the extent that the two concepts can be considered separate, anyway).  Yuri is able to succeed largely because of his unique moral flexibility, a trait that allows him to overtake former arms-dealing kingpin Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), who's hindered by his pesky habit of taking sides.  Sure, Yuri has reservations at times, but the temptation offered by a big score always outweighs the satisfaction of earning an honest buck.Yuri is periodically joined in his dealings by his kid brother Vitaly, who's everything Yuri isn't: wild, undisciplined, equally prone to orgiastic drug use and sex and paralyzing attacks of conscience.  As played by Jared Leto, Vitaly is the voice of sanity and conscience in a business that has no room for either, making him conspicuously less fit for the job than his brother.  Yuri also winds up with a pretty trophy wife in the form of his childhood dream girl Ava (played by Bridget Moynahan, better known in my neck of the woods as Tom Brady's girlfriend).  Since Ava's never achieved anything in her life beyond looking good, it's a rather thankless role, but Bridget does what she can in her few dramatic moments.I must say, some of the more critical analyses of this movie on this site have left me a bit perplexed.  Some people seem to be interpreting it as another hand-wringing ""message movie"" from the Hollywood left, but I don't really see too heavy-handed an agenda here beyond showing what an ugly place the world often is.  If anything, it aims to illustrate the moral bankruptcy behind the lofty claims of those who proclaim themselves patriots, freedom fighters, or other such high-minded labels.  After one of his deals leads to a massacre of Sierra Leonean civilians, Yuri muses that people say evil prevails when good men do nothing, when they should just say evil prevails.  In a world filled with bigotry, hatred, and violence, it's not that hard to see his point.",4,"""Where there's a will, there's a weapon""",1139011200,"02 4, 2006",2006,5961,"['reading', 'Third',

To see what I mean, read the following direct quotes or better yet, watch the film (at least once)for yourself:""There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation. That's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet. The only question is: How do we arm the other eleven?""""Back then, I didn't sell to Osama Bin Laden. Not because of moral reasons, but because he was always bouncing checks.""""The reason I'll be released is the same reason you think I'll be convicted. I do rub shoulders with some of the most vile, sadistic men calling themselves leaders today. But some of these men are the enemies of your enemies. And while the biggest arms dealer in the world is your boss--the President of the United States, who ships more merchandise in a day than I do in a year--sometimes it's embarrassing to have his fingerprints on the guns. Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me to supply forces he can't be seen supplying. So. You call me evil, but unfortunately for you, I'm a necessary evil.""""Of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal, nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947. More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists.
