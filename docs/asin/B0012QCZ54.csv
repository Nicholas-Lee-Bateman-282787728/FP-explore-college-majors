1138715,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0012QCZ54,Andrew Ellington,"[8, 9]","Okay, so these new wave dance flicks are a dime a dozen, and half of them are just mediocre offerings with one impossible dance move after the next.  When `Step Up' came out I really expected nothing from it, but I got a sensational and really, really great movie that had enough heart and chemistry to make it stand out amongst the onslaught of trashy teen dance movies.  Really, you need to see it!  So, I was excited about the prospects of `Step Up 2: The Streets', but after seeing the trailer I was afraid it was going to be nothing more than a rehash of the same story with different actors.So I waited.I am happy (so happy) to say that `Step Up 2: The Streets' does not have the same story, even though it is slightly similar.  It does lack the chemistry that made the original so charming, but the lead actress, Briana Evigan, carries enough saucy charm to make up for Robert Hoffman's lack of everything (the guy is kind of gross creepy here).Andie is a teen with no real purpose.  Her mother dies when she was young and she's been living with her mother's best friend.  She finds herself at a crossroads when her ties with the infamous 410 (a dance crew) leave her with two options; a prestigious dance school or Texas.  Now, I live in Texas, so I understand why she opted for the school.  She doesn't fit in (of course) but she finds herself flirting with even more danger when the school legend Chase Collins takes a liking to Andie, and her dance style, and convinces her to join forces with him, and a slew of talented yet overlooked students, in order to take on a street dancing competition.  Love develops, feelings are trampled, rivalries are started...and dancing HAPPENS!Like I said, Evigan is great.  She is sensual with a kick of edge that keeps her interesting; and that smoker's voice is just, UGH, so Scarlett Johansson...me loves it!  Robert Hoffman is the opposite.  He is supposed to be all charming and sweet and lovable but he comes across creepy.  The rest of the cast is really just a collection of moving bodies, and they all work well in that respect.  Miss Ventura is stunning to look at whether she's moving or standing still, I'll give her that.  Black Thomas (yes, that is his name) is respectable as the token gangster (very clich&eacute;, but whatever) and Danielle Polanco is quite engaging as the street-smart and genuinely sweet Missy.But this is not about acting, believe me.The dancing is insane here, and the final dance scene, in the rain, is just UGH, WOW...that was hot!  Yes, I said hot, and I meant that in like every possible way.  I did want to mention Adam G. Sevani (who looks like `Year One' version Michael Cera) who is your typical `nerdy kid who befriends outcast' here.  The reason I mention him is because his Michael Jackson inspired dace sequence at the end is phenomenal and easily the most memorable part of the entire movie.So, if you want a fun and entertaining film with lots of dancing then this is the one for you.  It doesn't have the `everything' factor that the original had, but it makes up for it in other areas.See them both.",4,Time to dance your booty off...,1255305600,"10 12, 2009",2009,3101,"['Okay', 'new', 'wave', 'dance', 'flicks', 'are', 'dime', 'dozen', 'half', 'are', 'just', 'mediocre', 'offerings', 'one', 'impossible', 'dance', 'move', 'next', 'When', 'Step', 'Up', 'came', 'really', 'expected', 'nothing', 'got', 'sensational', 'really', 'really', 'great', 'movie', 'had', 'enough', 'heart', 'chemistry', 'make', 'stand', 'out', 'onslaught', 'trashy', 'teen', 'dance', 'movies', 'Really', 'need', 'see', 'So', 'was', 'excited', 'prospects', 'Step', 'Up', '2', 'Streets', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'was', 'afraid', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'nothing', 'more', 'rehash', 'same', 'story', 'different', 'actors.So', 'waited.I', 'am', 'happy', 'so', 'happy', 'say', 'Step', 'Up', '2', 'Streets', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'story', 'even', 'slightly', 'similar', 'lack', 'chemistry', 'made', 'original', 'charming', 'lead', 'actress', 'Briana', 'Evigan', 'enough', 'saucy', 'charm', 'make', 'up', 'Robert', 'Hoffman', 'lack', 'everything', 'guy', 'kind', 'gross', 'creepy', 'here', '.Andie', 'teen', 'real', 'purpose', 'mother', 'dies', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'been', 'living', 'mother', 'best', 'friend', 'crossroads', 'when', 'ties', 'infamous', '410', 'dance', 'crew', 'leave', 'two', 'options', 'prestigious', 'dance', 'school', 'Texas', 'Now', 'live', 'Texas', 'understand', 'why', 'opted', 'school', ""n't"", 'fit', 'course', 'flirting', 'even', 'more', 'danger', 'when', 'school', 'legend', 'Chase', 'Collins', 'liking', 'Andie', 'dance', 'style', 'join', 'forces', 'slew', 'talented', 'yet', 'overlooked', 'students', 'order', 'take', 'street', 'dancing', 'competition', 'Love', 'feelings', 'are', 'trampled', 'rivalries', 'are', 'started', 'dancing', 'HAPPENS', 'said', 'Evigan', 'great', 'sensual', 'kick', 'edge', 'interesting', 'smoker', 'voice', 'just', 'UGH', 'so', 'Scarlett', 'Johansson', 'Robert', 'Hoffman', 'opposite', 'supposed', 'be', 'charming', 'sweet', 'lovable', 'creepy', 'rest', 'cast', 'really', 'just', 'collection', 'moving', 'bodies', 'work', 'well', 'respect', 'Miss', 'Ventura', 'stunning', 'look', 'moving', 'standing', 'still', ""'ll"", 'give', 'Black', 'Thomas', 'yes', 'name', 'respectable', 'token', 'gangster', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Danielle', 'Polanco', 'quite', 'engaging', 'street-smart', 'genuinely', 'sweet', 'Missy.But', 'not', 'acting', 'believe', 'me.The', 'dancing', 'insane', 'here', 'final', 'dance', 'scene', 'rain', 'just', 'UGH', 'WOW', 'was', 'hot', 'Yes', 'said', 'hot', 'meant', 'possible', 'way', 'did', 'want', 'mention', 'Adam', 'G.', 'Sevani', 'who', 'Year', 'One', 'version', 'Michael', 'Cera', 'who', 'typical', 'nerdy', 'kid', 'who', 'outcast', 'here', 'reason', 'mention', 'Michael', 'Jackson', 'inspired', 'dace', 'sequence', 'end', 'phenomenal', 'easily', 'most', 'memorable', 'part', 'entire', 'movie.So', 'want', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'film', 'lots', 'dancing', 'then', 'one', ""n't"", 'have', 'everything', 'factor', 'original', 'had', 'up', 'other', 'areas.See']",Step Up 2: The Streets Dance-Off Edition

Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","STEP UP 2: THE STREETS, man, it's a clumsy film title and hearing it probably won't make you catch your breath in anticipation. But hold up. This is a pretty good musical drama. It's also a sequel toStep Up (Widescreen Edition), the 2006 Channing Tatum/Jenna Dewan surpriser which made enough duckets in the box office so that, now, we get a return visit to the prestigious Maryland School of the Arts.A wave of public disturbances has hit Baltimore, public disturbances in the way of sizzling street dancing, baby. This time out, the troubled kid is Andie (Briana Evigan), an orphan who gets in trouble because of her street gang affiliation but who then gets a second chance when she's accepted into the Maryland School of the Arts. But it's not all about Andie. When her time spent at the MSA gets her booted out of her street crew, the notorious 410, she forms her own crew, consisting mostly of misfit students at the MSA. And, of course, there's an ongoing underground dance competition. And, of course, there's an exhilarating, stop-the-presses dance battle at the end. Naturally, the dance-off is between the MSA crew and the 410.It's a straightforward, by-the-numbers story, but we all know that the story is just there to prop up the spectacular dance sequences. The acting by the kids is serviceable, with Briana Evigan, daughter of Greg Evigan, holding the viewers' attention with her sexy, spirited presence. The other standout, to me, is scene-stealer Adam G. Sevani, who plays the gangly, geeky Moose. On the other hand, that guy who plays the stuffy dance director is awful.This is a PG-13 flick, so it's got pretty tame street cred. One of the kids gets roughed up a bit and a dance studio is vandalized. The tough talking, keeping-it-real smack the kids spout here is about as tough and keeps it about as real as a 1970's Kurt Russell Disney movie. Near the end of this flick, does anyone really buy into that boisterous crowd being swayed so easily by Andie's ""We call this a battle, but what are we fighting for"" speech? Yikes!There are some good-looking folks in this cast, so if you're wondering about the raunch factor, well, there's a kiss at the end, which I guess is smoking enough that it won the 2008 MTV Best Kiss Award, for whatever that's worth. But most of the lascivious stuff pops up in the dance routines.Apologies to the bellylicious Briana Evigan, but the backbone of STEP UP 2 is the electrifying street dancing. While the plot here is as anemic as that of the first film, the dance elements in this sequel are even more dynamic and definitely more street-centric. Breakdancing, krumping, popping, locking, you name it, it's here. Briana herself shows off some skills, but, really, the sickest moves are demonstrated by the 410 crew, by Adam Sevani and by the actors who play Monster, Cable, and Missy. Robert Hoffman (Chase) doesn't have Channing Tatum's magnetism, but he contributes with some nifty popping. Speaking of Tyler Gage (Tatum), he drops in for an extended cameo, to add continuity and provide a link to the first STEP UP. His one-on-one dance battle with Andie happens to be one of the movie's showstoppers.The music is so key to movies like this. The STEP UP 2 soundtrack, aggressive and with plenty of head-bopping hooks, is a crucial supporting character. Viewers be cautioned, as these songs  may induce manic bouts of getting down (or attempts at getting down). Just don't hurt yourself. Some of the hot tracks included are Flo Rida & T-Pain, ""Low,"" Missy Elliott's ""Shake Your Pom Pom,"" and Digital Underground's classic ""Humpty Dance."" This last track, by the way, is perfectly, hilariously used in the MSA crew's online prank.STEP UP 2: THE STREETS isn't as sanitized as HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, but neither does it come close to the gritty reality of, say, theRizedocumentary. Still, the focus here is on the dancing. And, when it comes to that, the pulse of the street beats in this film.",4,Better than the movie's title would suggest...,1223769600,"10 12, 2008",2008,3947,"['STEP', 'UP', '2', 'STREETS', 'man', 'clumsy', 'film', 'title', 'hearing', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'make', 'catch', 'breath', 'anticipation', 'hold', 'up', 'pretty', 'good', 'musical', 'drama', 'also', 'sequel', 'toStep', 'Up', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', '2006', 'Channing', 'Tatum/Jenna', 'Dewan', 'surpriser', 'made', 'enough', 'duckets', 'box', 'office', 'so', 'now', 'get', 'return', 'visit', 'prestigious', 'Maryland', 'School', 'Arts.A', 'wave', 'public', 'disturbances', 'hit', 'Baltimore', 'public', 'disturbances', 'way', 'sizzling', 'street', 'dancing', 'baby', 'time', 'out', 'troubled', 'kid', 'Andie', 'Briana', 'Evigan', 'orphan', 'who', 'trouble', 'street', 'gang', 'affiliation', 'who', 'then', 'second', 'chance', 'when', 'accepted', 'Maryland', 'School', 'Arts', 'not', 'Andie', 'When', 'time', 'spent', 'MSA', 'booted', 'street', 'crew', 'notorious', '410', 'own', 'crew', 'consisting', 'mostly', 'misfit', 'students', 'MSA', 'course', 'ongoing', 'underground', 'dance', 'competition', 'course', 'exhilarating', 'stop-the-presses', 'dance', 'battle', 'end', 'Naturally', 'dance-off', 'MSA', 'crew', '410.It', 'straightforward', 'by-the-numbers', 'story', 'know', 'story', 'just', 'there', 'prop', 'up', 'spectacular', 'dance', 'sequences', 'acting', 'kids', 'serviceable', 'Briana', 'Evigan', 'daughter', 'Greg', 'Evigan', 'holding', 'viewers', 'attention', 'sexy', 'spirited', 'presence', 'other', 'standout', 'scene-stealer', 'Adam', 'G.', 'Sevani', 'who', 'gangly', 'geeky', 'Moose', 'other', 'hand', 'guy', 'who', 'stuffy', 'dance', 'director', 'awful.This', 'PG-13', 'flick', 'got', 'pretty', 'tame', 'street', 'cred', 'One', 'kids', 'roughed', 'up', 'bit', 'dance', 'studio', 'vandalized', 'tough', 'talking', 'keeping-it-real', 'smack', 'kids', 'spout', 'here', 'tough', 'as', 'real', '1970', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'Disney', 'movie', 'end', 'flick', 'anyone', 'really', 'buy', 'boisterous', 'crowd', 'being', 'swayed', 'easily', 'Andie', 'call', 'battle', 'what', 'are', 'fighting', 'speech', 'Yikes', 'are', 'good-looking', 'folks', 'cast', 'so', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'raunch', 'factor', 'well', 'kiss', 'end', 'guess', 'smoking', 'enough', 'won', '2008', 'MTV', 'Best', 'Kiss', 'Award', 'whatever', 'worth', 'most', 'lascivious', 'stuff', 'up', 'dance', 'routines.Apologies', 'bellylicious', 'Briana', 'Evigan', 'backbone', 'STEP', 'UP', '2', 'electrifying', 'street', 'dancing', 'plot', 'here', 'as', 'anemic', 'first', 'film', 'dance', 'elements', 'sequel', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'dynamic', 'definitely', 'more', 'street-centric', 'Breakdancing', 'krumping', 'popping', 'locking', 'name', 'here', 'Briana', 'skills', 'really', 'sickest', 'moves', 'are', 'demonstrated', '410', 'crew', 'Adam', 'Sevani', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'Monster', 'Cable', 'Missy', 'Robert', 'Hoffman', 'Chase', ""n't"", 'have', 'Channing', 'Tatum', 'magnetism', 'nifty', 'popping', 'Speaking', 'Tyler', 'Gage', 'Tatum', 'extended', 'cameo', 'add', 'continuity', 'provide', 'link', 'first', 'STEP', 'UP', 'one-on-one', 'dance', 'battle', 'Andie', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'showstoppers.The', 'music', 'so', 'key', 'movies', 'STEP', 'UP', '2', 'soundtrack', 'aggressive', 'plenty', 'head-bopping', 'hooks', 'crucial', 'supporting', 'character', 'Viewers', 'be', 'cautioned', 'songs', 'may', 'induce', 'manic', 'bouts', 'getting', 'down', 'attempts', 'getting', 'down', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'hot', 'tracks', 'included', 'are', 'Flo', 'Rida', 'T-Pain', 'Low', 'Missy', 'Elliott', 'Shake', 'Your', 'Pom', 'Pom', 'Digital', 'Underground', 'classic', 'Humpty', 'Dance', 'last', 'track', 'way', 'perfectly', 'hilariously', 'used', 'MSA', 'crew', 'online', '2', 'STREETS', ""n't"", 'as', 'sanitized', 'HIGH', 'SCHOOL', 'MUSICAL', 'neither', 'come', 'close', 'gritty', 'reality', 'say', 'theRizedocumentary', 'Still', 'focus', 'here', 'dancing', 'when', 'pulse', 'street', 'beats', 'film']",Step Up 2: The Streets Dance-Off Edition

On this basis, this movie is lucky to get 2 stars.On the other hand, I watched this movie primarily because I love dancing, and the dancing in this movie was pretty good - not amazing, but still pretty good.  Unfortunately, the bulk of the dancing doesn't really show up until the final showdown scenes of the movie, and in fact perhaps the best dancing is to be found while the final credits are rolling, as well as in the bonus materials.  Particularly egregious in this regard is putting the JabbaWockeeZ performance in the bonus materials and only showing a small sample in the movie itself.  The director, John Chu, makes the excuse there wasn't time to include this material in the movie, but I don't buy it.  Given that this is a *dance* movie, all of the best dancing should have been included in the movie, and the resulting omission of non-dancing nonsense would have improved the movie, not worsened it.Nevertheless, I can still give the dancing 4 stars, so 3 stars for the movie overall.

1138754,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B0012QCZ54,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[6, 13]","This movie did not present ANYTHING new. It is as cliche'd as a film could get. The only thing different was that this time the poor chick was a white girl instead of a black or hispanic. I guess that was thrown in to score points but it didn't matter.There are many reasons to skip this film. First reason is that there are a gazillion other movies out there JUST like it. Second reason is that many of those other films are much better than this in terms of acting and the dancing. Third reason is that this movie was just too cliche' to be interesting.Supposedly Andie comes from ""the streets"" but she is no more street than John McCain! She's an unattractive tomboy who is trying too hard to be tough and the actress doesn't fit the role. She looks ten years older than the age of her character and so does the blond guy who is the supporting star. They both look at least early 30's trying to pass for teens. Their romance was unbelievable because they didn't have any chemistry at all. This movie would have been better if it centered around Andie's old crew that was ""really"" from the streets. They kept this film alive through all the boring and draggy spots.The main characters are wooden and they cannot act. They are obviously professional dancers and not actors. The dance moves are cute (at times) but nothing new. If you're gonna do another dance movie, the moves should be different than anything that's been done before. This film copied all of their dance moves from films like ""Stomp The Yard"". NOTHING was new! The only difference was that Stomp The Yard was much better and the dancing was fierce.I don't know why Step Up 2 was made but this is definitely a sequel that shouldn't have been. This is a ridiculous movie. I admit it's entertaining on a low level if you're not expecting much or if you haven't seen a dance flick before. If you haven't then you might think these moves were new but they weren't. There was nothing original about the dancing, actors or the plot. I've never seen so many cliche's in ONE movie.This movie was also unrealistic. The worst part was the street dance competition in the end. There would be no way that these clean cut wannabes would have even been allowed to go into an inner city club or participate in an innercity dance contest! They would have been beaten up if anything. That was too fake for words. The film didn't properly address the racial tensions and how serious street dancers are with their turf. Everyone is not welcomed and not just anyone can participate. If this film was gonna truly show how things are with the dance groups of the real streets, then they should have done some research. In real life they would have eaten those white kids up for lunch. I understand that the message of the film was to ""bring people together in the streets through dance"" and that's great but they should have tackled the rougher issues in the film to truly show the importance of that message. The characters should have been confronted with real hardships and struggles and they weren't.Please skip this one if you are spending money. Watch it on Starz for free like I did. The economy is too bad to waste money on a movie like this that you can predict from the time it starts to the time it ends. If you want to watch a GREAT dance film that will blow you away  with some good acting and some folks from the real streets, then check out, ""Stomp The Yard"".

But can she find a home with the assortment of geeks, preppies and classically-trained arty types who attend the school?  And can she succeed as a student without turning her back on her ""homies"" from the old neighborhood?  Or will she be forced to form her own crew from dancers at the school to compete with the Big Boys out on the streets?You can write the script yourself, but the key selling-point of this sequel to ""Step Up"" - sort of a mash-up of ""Fame,"" ""Footloose"" and ""School of Rock"" - is clearly not the storytelling but the dancing.  And in that respect it delivers the goods.  So ignore the predictable plotting, the tinny dialogue, the corny inspirational speeches, the wafer-thin characters, the obligatory montage sequences and the amateurish acting, and simply revel in the moves, street-dance or otherwise, that permeate the film.

1138765,A2C5VLIJMDPWHI,B0012QCZ54,"Shamontiel L. Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 5]","I love hip hop--the music, the breaking (along with other forms of dancing), and the culture, but I have yet to see a hip hop movie that I really loved. The reason why these movies always fail (""Honey,"" ""Save the Last Dance,"" ""You Got Served,"" ""Step Up,"") are because the movies either fail in acting skills or level of dance. I enjoyed ""Step Up"" solely because of Channing Tatum's excellent dance skills, but the girl in that movie looked like she was counting every single hip hop step. In ""How She Move,"" the issue was that the music directors kept playing music during the stepping scenes and stepping is supposed to be so powerful that you just listen to the body music, also an issue in parts of ""Stomp the Yard"" (although I loved the latter film). I was not at all surprised when I wasn't moved by this film. The lead female character, like so many others, looked like she learned hip hop dancing yesterday right after her model shoot. I'm not saying this to be facetious, but the problem with Hollywood movies is they pick what they think people will find attractive rather than skill level. I watched Briana Evigan dance, and almost every move was followed by some video girl pose or hard concentration on her face. Miss Prissy (of ""Rize"") is a good example of how a female whose background is in hip hop usually looks when she dances. The grit in the female dancers is ALWAYS missing in these movies, but it's replaced by pop star poses. I hate that!If we get past her character, which could have been left out altogether and focused moreso on Chase Collins (played by Robert Hoffman), this movie might've worked. I have seen him on ""Wild n' Out,"" and I think he has phenomenal skill. His acting skills are cool too, but I also wasn't buying Evigan's acting. The first half of the movie, especially with the 410 Crew, sounded like they were reading straight from the script. No emotion; just words. That made me think of ""You Got Served"" again, which had to be the worst acting I've ever seen. ""Breakin' and ""Breakin' 2"" also had bad acting, but the dancing was so tight that I didn't even care.This movie also had more cliches than a little bit: 1) a guy and a girl sitting in a tree kissing (Are you serious? And who climbs trees with a dress on?); 2) a guy and a girl kissing in the rain; 3) the entire crowd in the final scene going out through what looked like a storm and not one person put up an umbrella (Sistas are NOT trying to get their hair wet; ask one sista you know right now to go stand outside in the rain and see how she looks at you); 4) no reason whatsoever that Moose should've been a nerd nor was that character developed enough; 5) Andie's crew went to the club to show off their new moves but they acted like they were new to the neighborhood, which doesn't make any sense considering Andie used to be in 410 Crew and Chase frequented this area and danced in the very beginning of the movie (How do you make someone look inexperienced who has experience from years of practicing?)Pros: The el train scene at the beginning of the movie kicked this movie into high gear, and I was immediately entertained. I loved the dude (Alfred ""Black"" Thomas) who plays Tuck, although I wish he'd take that scowl off his face every once in awhile. I checked him out in ""Stomp the Yard,"" but I got to really admire his dancing in this film. I always enjoy watching Channing Tatum because he dances so tight and puts a little stank in his moves, almost like he's also influenced by traditional African dancing with the popping. Robert Hoffman was ridiculous as usual, and I'd like to see a dance off between him and Channing. I wish Mari Koda played the female lead because she killed her role in this movie. It's about time that movies started incorporating the Asian influence in hip hop; I know Japanese people who live and breathe it harder than the average person in the club. Everything about her dancing was polished. However, the person who really caught my attention was Moose (Adam G. Sevani). That cat was SICK! If I saw him walking down the street, I wouldn't peg him as a hip hop head, but everything about his moves told me he's been dancing for a long time, and if he hasn't, he sure fooled me. To put it plain, there were a couple of girls that I took notice of, but overall, the guys outshined them in this movie. And I was so amped to see the JabbaWockeez. They are one of the best crews I've ever seen in my entire life.Would I want to see this movie again? No. Will I buy it? Nope, renting it was fine. But I still have faith that someday there will be a hip hop movie that I can go ""That's it! That has all of the elements--great acting, excellent dancing, and an unpredictable plot."" At least I hope so because this movie plot was about as recycled as the blue bag program.",2,"Good to see JabbaWockeez, Robert Hoffman, and Mari Koda",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,4812,"['love',
