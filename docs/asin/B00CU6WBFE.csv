I have it a chance to the very end but it sucked. the story line has potential but it just didn't deliver. Neither was it very funny. They also had lots of homosexual references which I going disgusting. There is a guy who dresses like a girl and is in love with the main character who doesn't seem to be all that bothered by it. Also the main character's younger sister is in love with him. Incest. This was by far the worst  anime ive purchased.

1651051,A37EO4MVBGHEAP,B00CU6WBFE,Andrew R. McLaren,"[2, 3]","My teenage son LOVES this story and can't wait for Season II to come out. I liked it - great crisp artwork, good storyline, great music, funny yet moving in the right places... but.The review covers both parts 1 and 2 of Season I.I've listed most of the the pros above. It is also watchable as a standalone season. 'Haganai' has a second season already, in which the relationships formed in the 'Make Friends Club' deepen, but you don't need it to get the basic bitter-sweetness of the story. I also appreciated how the male lead, Kodaka, is written as a counter-harem character. Although surrounded by all the normal anime harem elements he has no bleeding nose, no crush, no kinky urges about the 10-year olds or the cross-dresser, few illusions about the women, and acts the gentleman. There's also no breaking the 4th wall which is almost refreshing for this genre.The cons are worth knowing however:1. The fanservice is quite cynical. This is not just a cheeky micro-second scene-cut, discreetly 'steamed' image or final ""cheesecake"" pose in a different art-style. We're talking slow pans of a girl's rear view as she bends over in tight pants. Don't be in the same room as your grandparents/parents/children while watching.2. The lead female, Yozora, is written with a really nasty streak, truly sadistic. It may make her more 'human' but would you want to be in the same room as her, repeatedly? Kodaka's quiet toleration of her grates after a while.3. It's a rehash or alternative take on another by the same studio, short title Oreimo, long title roughly 'my little sister can't be this cute.'4. Kodaka has returned to his boyhood home. He used to have a best friend. What happened to the friend? This plot mystery element is telegraphed and obvious to everyone except Kodaka.",4,Great story but...,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1785,"['teenage', 'son', 'LOVES', 'story', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'Season', 'II', 'come', 'out', 'liked', 'great', 'crisp', 'artwork', 'good', 'storyline', 'great', 'music', 'funny', 'yet', 'moving', 'right', 'places', 'but.The', 'review', 'parts', '1', '2', 'Season', 'I.I', ""'ve"", 'listed', 'most', 'pros', 'also', 'watchable', 'standalone', 'season', ""'Haganai"", 'second', 'season', 'already', 'relationships', 'formed', ""'Make"", 'Friends', 'Club', 'deepen', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'get', 'basic', 'bitter-sweetness', 'story', 'also', 'appreciated', 'how', 'male', 'lead', 'Kodaka', 'written', 'counter-harem', 'character', 'surrounded', 'normal', 'anime', 'harem', 'elements', 'bleeding', 'nose', 'crush', 'kinky', '10-year', 'olds', 'cross-dresser', 'few', 'illusions', 'women', 'gentleman', 'also', 'breaking', '4th', 'wall', 'almost', 'refreshing', 'genre.The', 'cons', 'are', 'worth', 'knowing', 'however:1', 'fanservice', 'quite', 'cynical', 'not', 'just', 'cheeky', 'micro-second', 'scene-cut', 'discreetly', ""'steamed"", 'image', 'final', 'cheesecake', 'pose', 'different', 'art-style', ""'re"", 'talking', 'slow', 'pans', 'girl', 'rear', 'view', 'tight', 'pants', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'room', 'grandparents/parents/children', 'watching.2', 'lead', 'female', 'Yozora', 'written', 'really', 'nasty', 'streak', 'truly', 'sadistic', 'may', 'make', 'more', ""'human"", 'would', 'want', 'be', 'same', 'room', 'repeatedly', 'Kodaka', 'quiet', 'toleration', 'grates', 'while.3', 'rehash', 'alternative', 'take', 'same', 'studio', 'short', 'title', 'Oreimo', 'long', 'title', 'roughly', 'little', 'sister', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'cute.', '4', 'Kodaka', 'returned', 'boyhood', 'home', 'used', 'have', 'best', 'friend', 'What', 'happened', 'friend', 'plot', 'mystery', 'element', 'telegraphed', 'obvious', 'everyone', 'Kodaka']",Haganai: I Don't Have Many Friends

I happily bought this and was really excited to get it.Then I started watching.  The jokes where falling flat, flatter, flattest.  The story just lay there and barely moved.  The big surprise ending was obvious fairly early on.  From a technical standpoint everything was great, it looked good, it sounded good, and yet the story just failed.And it is too bad too because every so often, it did have me doubled up laughing.  Inside jokes referring to a couple of the voice actresses previous works I really enjoyed.  The concept of fighting mecha as extreme hardcore gay male porn was pure brilliance.  4 or 5 times this show had me giggling to the point I had to pause the show so I did not miss anything while I laughed.

She also has no friends.One day,Kodaka returning to retrieve left-behind gym clothes,hears a conversation behind a closed door. Opening it slowly,he finds Yozora having a lively conversation with someone Kodaka cannot see. Interest piqued,he asks Yozora with whom she is talking to. Her attempt to claim it is her ""air friend,Tomo"" is brief and futile. She does express a clue to a surprise near the end by stating her ""air friend"" will never betray her.Their conversation continues to develop until she has an idea that will help them become accepted and popular; the idea for the Neighbor's Club is formed.Yozora commandeers a room for the club by bullying a 10-year-old nun out of her nap room. One of the delights of this series is watching Yozora in action. She is intelligent,quick-witted,caustic and pushy,not to mention vey attractive.She also demands and gets the little nun,Sister Maria,as club sponser.The first new wanta'be member is Sina,who is hated with a passion by Yozora;she doesn't know her personally but as Sina is the daughter of the academy head master and has big boobs and has boys hanging all over her but she has no real friend.You can see why Yozora wouldn't like her,I guess.Eventually,Yozora renames her ""Meat"".Rika is so smart she has a special lab established for her private use,she attends no classes,she has no friends and is so nasty-minded she can read a normal manga as sexual erotica.Yukimura stalks Kodaka and is caught. ""He""(maybe) explains that his parents gave him the name of a famous samurai in hopes of him becoming a strong man.He isn't and he is the target of constant bullying and has no friends. He sees Kadaka as his master.This proves to be a point of seriuos comedy as the series develops. But first,he encounters Yozora who convinces him that his masculinity will become stronger if he wears a maid outfit and serve the rest of the club as a maid.Not only does he do so he seems delighted to do it.Kodaka has a 14-year-old sister in his care that sees herself as the ruler of some space empire and dresses as such.She has no friends either.This series,long awaited to be released in the US, is fast paced,exceptionaly well-colored,drawn,acted and directed and is one of only a handful of exceptional releases this season.

Fast forward to 2013 and the second season came out; I was elated however something just didn't seem to be as light-hearted, the story took a very serious turn that left me wanting so much more.

1651080,AAGLJJ0OUBO8V,B00CU6WBFE,Tim,"[21, 24]","If you look at my review history, you can actually see my progress on this series. I reviewed the first volume of the manga shortly after its release and gave it a positive review, noting that I had not yet seen the anime. Well, I watched it on Hulu now, and I can now declare that I am a huge fan of this series, both anime and manga. It's actually managed to make it on my top 5 comedy list.The plot follows a group of students who, ""don't have many friends"" (that's the basic translation of the title). It's rather an inaccurate statement as they don't seem to have ANY friends whatsoever. One of them gets the idea to start a new club, ""The Neighbor's Club,"" to find people who are as desperate for friends as they are.The anime perfectly catches the comedy of this situation. It should be noted that someone going into this series looking for a lighthearted anime with cute characters making friends will probably be disappointed. Some of the characters are rather unpleasant. I do not say this to insult the series, in fact I applaud it for this choice, these are rather damaged people looking for friends, but lack the social skills to keep one. The cast of characters include Kodaka a scary looking guy (who's probably the nicest of the lot), Yozora a manipulative girl with an imaginary friend, Sena a rich and pretty girl whose status (and her constantly reminding everyone of it) creates tension when she tries to make friends, Yukimura a guy(?) who is trying to be more manly and Rika, brilliant scientist and constant source of intentional innuendo. There are others, but these are the chief members of the club.Throughout the series, these people constantly torment each other, bicker, argue and occasionally try to imitate actions they see other students do around their friends. This last leads to many moments of utter comedy gold including (my favorite) an episode where the girls play a dating sim game in order to developed social skills. The choices they make in game were utterly hilarious, and I refuse to spoil it here.I should probably warn potential viewers that when I said these characters torment each other, I was serious. Several moments between Yozora and other characters can potentially make viewers uncomfortable as one of her greatest joys is tormenting the others until they cry. While this is played mostly for laughs, there are one or two moments where even the other characters seem to be getting uncomfortable at how far she goes.In closing: I love this series. It's one of the funniest anime series to come out in years. I applaud Funimation for releasing in on DVD/Blu and will be getting this day one. I give both the anime and the manga my highest recommendation.Note: There is a second season and Funimation has licensed the anime for the US so hopefully we'll see a release of that one too.",5,In my top 5 comedies.,1371081600,"06 13, 2013",2013,2837,"['look', 'review', 'history', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'progress', 'series', 'reviewed', 'first', 'volume', 'manga', 'shortly', 'release', 'gave', 'positive', 'review', 'noting', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'anime', 'Well', 'watched', 'Hulu', 'now', 'can', 'now', 'declare', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'series', 'anime', 'manga', 'actually', 'managed', 'make', 'top', '5', 'comedy', 'list.The', 'plot', 'group', 'students', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'many', 'friends', 'basic', 'translation', 'title', 'rather', 'inaccurate', 'statement', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'ANY', 'friends', 'whatsoever', 'One', 'idea', 'start', 'new', 'club', 'Neighbor', 'Club', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'desperate', 'friends', 'are.The', 'anime', 'perfectly', 'comedy', 'situation', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'someone', 'going', 'series', 'looking', 'lighthearted', 'anime', 'cute', 'characters', 'making', 'friends', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'characters', 'are', 'rather', 'unpleasant', 'do', 'not', 'say', 'insult', 'series', 'fact', 'applaud', 'choice', 'are', 'rather', 'damaged', 'people', 'looking', 'friends', 'lack', 'social', 'skills', 'keep', 'one', 'cast', 'characters', 'include', 'Kodaka', 'scary', 'looking', 'guy', 'who', 'probably', 'nicest', 'lot', 'manipulative', 'girl', 'imaginary', 'friend', 'Sena', 'rich', 'pretty', 'girl', 'status', 'constantly', 'reminding', 'everyone', 'tension', 'when', 'make', 'friends', 'Yukimura', 'guy', 'who', 'trying', 'be', 'more', 'manly', 'Rika', 'brilliant', 'scientist', 'constant', 'source', 'intentional', 'innuendo', 'are', 'others', 'are', 'chief', 'members', 'club.Throughout', 'series', 'people', 'constantly', 'torment', 'other', 'bicker', 'argue', 'occasionally', 'try', 'imitate', 'actions', 'see', 'other', 'students', 'do', 'friends', 'last', 'many', 'moments', 'utter', 'comedy', 'gold', 'including', 'favorite', 'episode', 'where', 'girls', 'play', 'dating', 'sim', 'game', 'order', 'developed', 'social', 'skills', 'choices', 'make', 'game', 'were', 'utterly', 'hilarious', 'refuse', 'spoil', 'should', 'probably', 'warn', 'potential', 'viewers', 'when', 'said', 'characters', 'torment', 'other', 'was', 'serious', 'Several', 'moments', 'Yozora', 'other', 'characters', 'can', 'potentially', 'make', 'viewers', 'uncomfortable', 'one', 'greatest', 'joys', 'tormenting', 'others', 'cry', 'played', 'mostly', 'laughs', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'moments', 'where', 'even', 'other', 'characters', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'uncomfortable', 'how', 'far', 'goes.In', 'closing', 'love', 'series', 'one', 'funniest', 'anime', 'series', 'come', 'out', 'years', 'applaud', 'Funimation', 'releasing', 'DVD/Blu', 'will', 'be', 'getting', 'day', 'one', 'give', 'anime', 'manga', 'highest', 'recommendation.Note', 'second', 'season', 'Funimation', 'licensed', 'anime', 'US', 'hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'release', 'one', 'too']",Haganai: I Don't Have Many Friends
