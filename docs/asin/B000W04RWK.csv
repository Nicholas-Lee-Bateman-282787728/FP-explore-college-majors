1105820,A141HP4LYPWMSR,B000W04RWK,Brian E. Erland,"[23, 25]","Note: French and English with English subtitles.The '05 film `The Rocket' is a long overdue cinematic biography of the greatest hockey player and icon in NHL history. More than just a sports film, the story of Maurice Richard is a story exposing the corruption and brutality of the sport as it was in the ""Golden Age"" of hockey and the overt bias throughout the league against the French speaking players in general and the Montreal Canadiens specifically. In the forties and fifties it was literally Montreal against the world and Maurice was the one player with the ability and fierce tenacity to take on all the inequities thrown his way and become a legend in his own time.I found the film to be absolutely riveting. The production values and acting is excellent and the dialogue insightful and realistic. Roy Dupuis was perfect in the role of Maurice as was Lucille LeBreton as his adoring and supportive wife Lucille. Even if you're not a hockey fan the film has much to teach about the era and more than hints to the reasons as to why there is so much internal strife between French and English speaking Canada to this day.My highest recommendation: -5 Stars-.",5,"""Maurice!

1105821,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000W04RWK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[0, 0]","I saw this YouTube clip some time ago about an old, long retired hockey player named Maurice ""The Rocket"" Richard who received such an extended standing ovation at the Montreal Forum's final game played that it got me almighty curious about him. I'm at best a very casual hockey fan, and even though I'd heard of his name somewhen before, I was taken aback by the Rocket's accomplishments on ice. First player in the National Hockey League to score 50 goals in 50 games. First to score 500 goals in a career. Left the sport as the NHL's then all-time leading scorer. Won the Stanley Cup eight times with the Montreal Canadiens. All of that and more are touched on in THE ROCKET - The Legend of Rocket Richard, an absorbing biopic drama about one of professional hockey's most celebrated icons.The Rocket's heyday was in the 1940s and '50s, during the raucous pre-helmet era, when multi-million dollar contracts were these fanciful castles in the air. Like every other blue-collar pro athlete, Maurice Richard had a day job. His was that of a factory machinist. There's an authenticity to the film's evocation of old Montreal, a backdrop that punctuates Richard'scommon man roots and also the casual discrimination that flavored the behavior of them folks what thought they were better than those lowly French-Canadians, of which Richard was one. ""Pea Soup!"" he was called, this a derogatory slang derived from World War I when the French-Canadian troops were regularly fed pea soup. Thanks for that trivia, the Internet.We see how tough it was for Richard, playing like a god, treated like a second-class citizen. He was the only star player whom the league didn't protect. The deeper into the film, the more caught up I got. The Rocket was such an underdog. He never started a fight but never backed down from one, either. He tried to enlist twice but was turned down both times as unfit for active duty on account of his being too fragile. When he was seriously injured early in his career, the voices on the radio were quick to dismiss him: ""We knew he was frail. It seems the Canadiens signed a lemon... a lemon that's easily crushed."" And then peep this sports headline: ""Les Canadiens cherchent des joueurs pour remplacer Richard et Charlie Sands."" Now I don't know what that all meant, but I figure it couldn't have been good for the Rocket. Or for Charlie Sands.Roy Dupuis plays the legend with conviction, plays him with grit and endearing sincerity. Word has it that the Rocket was a stoic mother, not one to open up, and thus not giving Dupuis much to work with. So credit the actor for making his character relatable. I'm not as devoted a hockey fan as I wish I were, and I don't know how far-ranging of an impact Richard actually had as a symbol of the French-speaking underclass in Canada, them Habs, them Pea Soups. I don't know how much he contributed in breaking down the racial barriers in Quebec. He put his thoughts down in an ongoing newspaper column, disclosing the occasional hard-hitting opinion. And even a guy who keeps things close to the vest has a tipping point. Fed up with the rampant discrimination set against him, he acts out against a linesman, decks him proper, lays him out. He gets suspended for the remaining of the season. Cue the ensuing riot on the streets. Seeking more dramatic beats, maybe the film exagerrates Richard's role in the social reform front. Or maybe not. I'm no Habs historian. Certainly, if you go by that helluva extended ovation in that YouTube clip, you can't doubt how beloved of a figure the Rocket is.The film recreates several of Richard's amazing exploits on ice, including his scoring a goal while Red Wings defenseman Earl Siebert piggybacked him, and also his brother-in-law's notorious bet against the Rocket's scoring a goal because he had spent most of that day moving to a new house. Richard ended up scoring five goals and three assists in that game. And, as in another crowd-pleasing biopic, STAND AND DELIVER, as the screen fades to black, we read what happens to our character past the movie's timeline. My jaw gaped and then I cheered. You do that when you learn something amazing.Stephen McHattie nabs a scene-stealing role as the Montreal Canadiens' steely coach, the one guy who saw potential in an undersized, injury-prone, but very scrappy rookie. Julie Le Breton has the thankless role of playing Richard's wife. She's mostly relegated to wringing her hands and worrying about the persistent abuse her husband undergoes on ice. I do wish that we'd seen more of Richard's interacting with his teammates. Instead, the impression left is that while the Rocket was a well-respected teammate, he wasn't exactly well-loved. Most times, he's depicted as this isolated figure, even in a crowded locker room. But probably he was like that in real life, in which case props to the film for achieving another smidge of authenticity. Whatever. What I know is that this is a movie that compels the viewer's attention. The action on the ice is excitingly staged. Roy Dupuis is a whirling dervish. In fact, when the focus is on Richard as the relentless on-ice phenom, the movie is vastly entertaining. When he's presented as a crusader for the social underclass, well, I don't know that the story sells that so convincingly. But this is a must-see film, even for hockey non-enthusiasts.The film can be viewed either in its original French language (with the option for English sub-titles) or in English dub.

1105822,A2H4AWIOK1REMX,B000W04RWK,"J. C Clark ""eanna""","[2, 3]","I am not one at all, and know very little about the history of the NHL. Maurice Richard was a name to me like other vaguely heard names, Bill Tilden or Bronco Nagurski or Babe Zaharias Didrikson. I know all these athletes have interesting and important stories, but I have never investigated them, so they remain basically unknown.What prompted my wife to pick this film up, I cannot imagine. She has no interest in hockey, and nearly no interest in sports. But fortunately she did, as it is not a film about sport. It is a film about people, and the transformation of one man from suppressed bystander who allows injustice to go unremarked to vocal critic who stands up for right when wrong holds all the cards.The Maurice Richard in this film is a quiet man, a loner, and a bit fearful. But he is possessed by a burning drive and a hunger that makes him nearly unstoppable as a competitor. We see him rebuffed when he seeks permission to marry, and then we cut to wedding photographs. So though he appears ineffectual, he gets things done.When he decides to get things done off the rink, his world changes. I was riveted by the action and the story. The few complaints in here seem off target to me; I believed in this man and his life, his wife and his coach. Excellent acting, great photography, bad guys to hate. What more could you want? This is a beautifully made film, exciting and well filmed hockey action wonderfully blended with spot-on recreations of life in this time and place. I was constantly amazed at the detail and look.

1105824,A3ESRVKA3BW8AZ,B000W04RWK,John Mundie,"[1, 1]","The Rocket is best when it tells the story of Maurice Richard on the ice. There are some fantastically realistic recreations of great Rocket moments, complete with period lighting and historic snap shots. You could not have picked a better actor for the Richard role; Roy Dupuis is simply perfection, both on the ice and off. Stephen McHattie, as the hard nosed coach Dick Irvin, is also a joy to watch act (and boy oh boy, did Irvin ride Richard!) Not so for R&eacute;my Girard, the otherwise always memorable actor, who's barber character is nothing more than a platitudinous plot device.You see, the problem with this movie is that its sort of half of a movie. Or half of an interesting one. Why? Well, like another famous and contemporary athlete, Joe Louis, off the ice Maurice Richard isn't all that interesting or compelling. There is simply no fudging this.What the movie tries to do, and you can't blame the writers given the oft retold popular cultural history, is link Richard's life with the ""Quiet Revolution"" and nationalism (and separatism) in Qu&eacute;bec. This really doesn't wash, is explored in some pretty hammy vignettes, and is not true anyways. Actually, Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois historians have argued that Richard's role in this movement has been grossly exaggerated over time, and while certainly news worthy (and entertaining in the ""rear view mirror"" of history) it just ain't what happened.Which means that about half of this movie is a dud.

It desperately needed a hero. Working as a machinist in a factory was a young French-Canadian named Maurice Richard with dreams of playing in the NHL. When he finally earned a tryout with the Montreal Canadiens, he had already suffered one serious injury, and despite an impressive tryout, the owners did not want to take a chance. The coach took a hard line stance in favor of the young Maurice and got him on the team. He soon proved the owners right by getting injured again. It took some incredibly hard rehabilitation as well as enduring some brutal attacks by teammates who were testing him to convince the owners to give him another chance. So began the career of, arguably, the most loved and well known Montreal Canadien ever. He has been called the 'Babe Ruth of hockey'. In some ways, he was more like Jackie Robinson. French-Canadians had about the same status as African-Americans in the U.S. Although not the first F-C to play in the NHL, his success and popularity threatened the status quo. Despite scoring 50 goals in 50 games, he didn't win the scorng title because the teams conspired against him to the point of awarding assists to players not even on the ice to build up their point totals. As an aside, F-C fans even had to sit in a segregated section of the arena which was enclosed by a chain link fence. Not only is this an entertaining and inspiring hockey movie but it's a great education for someone not familiar with the history of Quebec and the fight for equality by the French Canadians.

1105827,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B000W04RWK,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[2, 2]","For Valentine's Day we decided to watch this exciting movie which has a good blend of romance, violence (who doesn't like to see a hockey fight?) and power struggles. We watched the English version but I would have preferred to have watched this in French with the English subtitles. Still it kept my attention to the end. I'm not much of a sport's fan but for some reason I love hockey. All the actors in this movie were top rate and fully embraced their roles. It was so great to find a movie that both my husband and I could enjoy together.~The Rebecca Review",5,As a Hockey Fan I Loved it!,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,562,"['Valentine', 'Day', 'decided', 'watch', 'exciting', 'movie', 'good', 'blend', 'romance', 'violence', 'who', ""n't"", 'like', 'see', 'hockey', 'fight', 'power', 'struggles', 'watched', 'English', 'version', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'have', 'watched', 'French', 'English', 'subtitles', 'Still', 'kept', 'attention', 'end', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'sport', 'fan', 'reason', 'love', 'hockey', 'actors', 'movie', 'were', 'top', 'rate', 'fully', 'embraced', 'roles', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'find', 'movie', 'husband', 'could', 'enjoy', 'together.~The', 'Rebecca', 'Review']",The Rocket

1105829,A2XUW4IZP6UPDL,B000W04RWK,To Be Simple,"[4, 4]","There are only a handful of sports-related movies that rank among my favorite all-time movies of any genre. The Rocket is among them. It tells the story of ""The Rocket,"" Maurice Richard. There are a couple of levels that should interest virtually anyone, hockey fan or not.First, the film is nicely directed. There are some angles of Richard's life that were left completely out of this film, but that is understandable since the movie clocks in at a little over two hours. Every scene in the movie has a purpose, which means the movie never drags. Also, the re-creation of some of the scenes are painstakingly faithful to what happened in reality. I have seen a good deal of actual footage from some of the games and events in the movie. It is incredible how accurate the movie version of the scenes parallel the actual footage. It also doesn't hurt that the actor who portrays Richard looks strikingly like the real deal.Second, the story itself is just plain inspirational and uplifting. Richard transcended sport in becoming a hero to the people of Quebec that went beyond the ice. He helped instill a sense of pride at a time in which French-speaking people in Canada were not having an easy time. Persistence, toughness, patience, and courage are a few of the words that can best describe Maurice Richard. All of these characteristics are brought out well in the film.The Rocket is the perfect movie to show a young hockey player or athlete to help them understand that a person should never give up on their dreams. It also demonstrates that people should not back down in the face of injustice. I give this movie my highest recommendation.",5,Incredible Movie!,1200960000,"01 22, 2008",2008,1647,"['are', 'only', 'handful', 'sports-related', 'movies', 'rank', 'favorite', 'all-time', 'movies', 'genre', 'Rocket', 'story', 'Rocket', 'Maurice', 'Richard', 'are', 'couple', 'levels', 'should', 'interest', 'virtually', 'anyone', 'hockey', 'fan', 'not.First', 'film', 'nicely', 'directed', 'are', 'angles', 'Richard', 'life', 'were', 'left', 'completely', 'film', 'understandable', 'movie', 'clocks', 'little', 'two', 'hours', 'scene', 'movie', 'purpose', 'movie', 'never', 'Also', 're-creation', 'scenes', 'are', 'painstakingly', 'faithful', 'what', 'happened', 'reality', 'have', 'seen', 'good', 'deal', 'actual', 'footage', 'games', 'events', 'movie', 'incredible', 'how', 'accurate', 'movie', 'version', 'scenes', 'actual', 'footage', 'also', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'actor', 'who', 'Richard', 'strikingly', 'real', 'deal.Second', 'story', 'just', 'plain', 'inspirational', 'uplifting', 'Richard', 'transcended', 'sport', 'becoming', 'hero', 'people', 'Quebec', 'went', 'ice', 'helped', 'instill', 'sense', 'pride', 'time', 'French-speaking', 'people', 'Canada', 'were', 'not', 'having', 'easy', 'time', 'Persistence', 'toughness', 'patience', 'courage', 'are', 'few', 'words', 'can', 'best', 'describe', 'Maurice', 'Richard', 'characteristics', 'are', 'brought', 'out', 'well', 'film.The', 'Rocket', 'perfect', 'movie', 'show', 'young', 'hockey', 'player', 'athlete', 'help', 'understand', 'person', 'should', 'never', 'give', 'up', 'dreams', 'also', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'back', 'down', 'face', 'injustice', 'give', 'movie', 'highest', 'recommendation']",The Rocket
