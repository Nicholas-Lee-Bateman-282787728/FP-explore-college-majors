297296,AT2J7H5TRZM8Z,6302135621,A Customer,"[3, 3]","I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and indeed, all is vanity and grasping for the wind. Ecclesiastes 1:14I have put off reviewing Citizen Kane for quite some time, as it seems to be so oft praised that it is almost impossible to be objective about it. Everybody knows something about Citizen Kane - even folks who have never seen it know that it is a classic, perhaps the classic - the best film ever made. How do you go about describing the Holy Grail of cinema without sounding like the usual sycophantic hack, grinding out his two cents worth of pulp on a movie that has already had more written about it than any other?It would probably help to remember that in 1941 the power of the newspapers was much greater than is evident today with television, cable, the Internet, and all the alternative means of communication we have at our fingertips. In those days, the newspaper was it - the only other major information source was the newsreels that accompanied Saturday movies - newsreels like the one that is used early in Citizen Kane to give a brief sketch of the deceased's life. Newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane was dead and the questions on everybody's lips were, &quot;Who was Kane?&quot; &quot;Why was Kane?&quot; and &quot;What did he mean by 'Rosebud' (his dying word)?&quot; If you watch the movie looking for answers to these questions, you are bound to come away dissatisfied as it answers them incompletely or not at all.Rather than recount the story which is so well known, or elaborate on the innovative techniques used in filming Citizen Kane, I thought it would be interesting to find out why Welles chose newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst as the model for the fictional Kane. What would be Welles' motivation to attack a public figure who had done him no wrong? Not only that, but why would he attack somebody with the power of the press at his beck and call, someone who could (and likely would) strike back. My research along those lines only revealed tantalizing snippets of information, not enough to satisfy my curiosity. Still, it has been well documented that Welles was a guy who liked controversy and William Randolph Hearst was a juicy target. Perhaps Citizen Kane is a great film because it is enigmatic, it doesn't give any easy answers. Therefore, my inquiry bore little fruit...Kane is the story of a man who gained everything, but at the cost of being deprived of his mother's love and companionship. An early scene shows him being separated from his mother and sent back east to live with a banker after his mother comes into a considerable fortune. From there, it shows the rise of a newspaper publisher and fall of a man who wound up dying friendless and alone in his palatial mansion &quot;Xanadu.&quot; What happened? When asked, Welles himself could not explain how Kane's dying word came to the knowledge of the reporter. However despite that little mystery, the movie has quite a bit of appeal.Kane's story is told via flashbacks (No, Quentin Tarantino did not invent them!) from five different points of view. A faceless newspaper reporter asks Kane's closest associates to tell their recollections of him. The reporter's questions provide the springboard for each of the flashbacks.Camera work and lighting by Gregg Toland used a technique called 'deep focus.' This, unlike conventional focus, allowed both foreground and background to be in razor-sharp focus at the same time allowing the viewer to decide which part of the scene to fasten his attention on. Lights and darks are used to depict the moods, light when happy, dark when depressed. Unusual camera angles abound and a number of scenes are long takes without editing. Voices, like in many of Welles' films, are often dubbed, allowing Welles to stage shots and insert and overlap dialog similar to actual human conversation. Great film editing by Robert Wise offered many dissolves, montages, and startling effects not often seen before. These and other techniques used in Citizen Kane are textbook examples used to demonstrate good film making today.The final scene of Kane shows Xanadu's basement, a vast landscape of possessions, the remains of Kane's mortal existence. Workers are classifying it, stacking it, and loading the junk into a furnace. By this time the alert viewer knows the 'book answer' to the reporter's question, &quot;What is Rosebud,&quot; however, while the film offers this obvious meaning, according to some reports it was William Randolph Hearst's pet term for his mistress' most private part. The camera pulls back and shows the smoke (the remembrance of Kane) from the furnace billowing from the castle's chimney.While nominated for nine academy awards, Kane won only for Best Screenplay, a collaboration between Herman Mankiewicz and Welles. Kane was the high water mark of Welles' success as a director. Due to backlash from Hearst and his powerful friends Welles was never allowed the luxury of such creative control again.What does it profit a man to gain the world and lose his soul?Citizen Kane should be required viewing by anybody interested in film. It shows the results of a prodigal life with many material benefits yet yielding very little spiritual fruit.",5,Private Parts: Citizen Kane,1008374400,"12 15, 2001",2001,5235,"['have', 'seen',

297298,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,6302135621,Acute Observer,"[1, 4]","The film opens on a silent and dark night. An old man dies peacefully in bed, alone. It shows the vast riches of this extremely wealthy man - his monument. Charles Foster Kane was the greatest newspaper tycoon of his day. His wealth derived from a gold mine in Colorado, obtained almost by chance. His newspapers were loved by many, and hated by many. The news reels give his history. He was on track to be elected governor, but a sex scandal caused a loss. He retired to Xanadu, his lavish estate, then died as all must. The journalists will try to investigate his life to figure out his dying words (as if that could be relevant to anybody). This film continues as a search to uncover a mystery that may be unexplainable.Charles Foster Kane was taken from his parents at an early age because of a contract his mother signed (her investment advisor). Kane received the best education money can buy, but this is omitted. Kane's pleasure is his newspaper, he is a crusader for the masses against the Robber Barons (to deprive a third party of this cause). But in time he is forced to sell control of his 'Inquirer' to a bank. The scenes show how editorial policy is remade. [Note the gas lights, an open flame.] Kane hires away the newspaper men from a competitor to create the greatest circulation in New York, the financial capital. Kane marries the niece of a President (money talks?). Jed Leland tells his memories of Kane. The scenes show Charles' changes in his marriage (he is more arrogant and powerful). Kane runs for governor, a liberal who is the friend of the working man and decent people. [But will the ruling class support this upstart?]Poor Charlie doesn't realize that private investigators were shadowing him, and his private life ends his hope for a public life. [Most big city politicians were taking payoffs to support the local corporations.] Nothing is more scandalous than a reformer with hidden faults; a politician who is known to love drink and women won't be defeated for this. Susan's singing career soon ends. Perhaps they aimed too high, musical comedies rather than grand opera? Some very dramatic scenes follow and reveal more of the personalities of Charles and Susan. Poor Susan can't stand the strain and pressure. Can a publisher really create a star? Can a millionaire provide a starring role for his girlfriend today? Does great wealth and power lead to corruption and insanity? Was Kane's search for love the result of an unhappy childhood? Charlie's vandalism of his wife's bedroom suggests a sick mind. There is an inventory of Kane's property. What is it worth? Kane saved everything (like many of his generation). At the end we see a child's sled and its name.This film may have been novel in its day, but now seems dated. It seems like it came from a radio play. It is not really historical or satirical. There were plenty of other targets available, but this film barely recognizes the events that existed during Kane's lifetime (post Civil War to World War II). A fictionalized account closer to reality might have been better.Since he died alone, how did anyone learn his last word?",4,A Biography of a Newspaper Tycoon,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,3129,"['film', 'silent', 'dark', 'night', 'old', 'man', 'peacefully', 'bed', 'alone', 'vast', 'riches', 'extremely', 'wealthy', 'man', 'monument', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'was', 'greatest', 'newspaper', 'tycoon', 'day', 'wealth', 'derived', 'gold', 'mine', 'Colorado', 'obtained', 'almost', 'chance', 'newspapers', 'were', 'loved', 'many', 'hated', 'many', 'news', 'reels', 'give', 'history', 'was', 'track', 'be', 'elected', 'governor', 'sex', 'scandal', 'caused', 'loss', 'retired', 'Xanadu', 'lavish', 'estate', 'then', 'died', 'must', 'journalists', 'will', 'try', 'investigate', 'life', 'figure', 'out', 'dying', 'words', 'could', 'be', 'relevant', 'anybody', 'film', 'search', 'uncover', 'mystery', 'may', 'be', 'unexplainable.Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'was', 'taken', 'parents', 'early', 'age', 'contract', 'mother', 'signed', 'investment', 'advisor', 'Kane', 'received', 'best', 'education', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'omitted', 'Kane', 'pleasure', 'newspaper', 'crusader', 'masses', 'Robber', 'Barons', 'deprive', 'third', 'party', 'cause', 'time', 'forced', 'sell', 'control', ""'Inquirer"", 'bank', 'scenes', 'show', 'how', 'editorial', 'policy', 'remade', '[', 'Note', 'gas', 'lights', 'open', 'flame', 'Kane', 'away', 'newspaper', 'men', 'competitor', 'create', 'greatest', 'circulation', 'New', 'York', 'financial', 'capital', 'Kane', 'niece', 'President', 'money', 'talks', 'Jed', 'Leland', 'memories', 'Kane', 'scenes', 'show', 'Charles', 'changes', 'marriage', 'more', 'arrogant', 'powerful', 'Kane', 'governor', 'liberal', 'who', 'friend', 'working', 'man', 'decent', 'people', '[', 'will', 'ruling', 'class', 'support', 'upstart', ']', 'Poor', 'Charlie', ""n't"", 'realize', 'private', 'investigators', 'were', 'shadowing', 'private', 'life', 'hope', 'public', 'life', 'Most', 'big', 'city', 'politicians', 'were', 'taking', 'payoffs', 'support', 'local', 'corporations', ']', 'Nothing', 'more', 'scandalous', 'reformer', 'hidden', 'faults', 'politician', 'who', 'known', 'love', 'drink', 'women', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'defeated', 'Susan', 'singing', 'career', 'soon', 'Perhaps', 'aimed', 'too', 'high', 'musical', 'comedies', 'rather', 'grand', 'opera', 'very', 'dramatic', 'scenes', 'follow', 'reveal', 'more', 'personalities', 'Charles', 'Susan', 'Poor', 'Susan', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'strain', 'pressure', 'Can', 'publisher', 'really', 'create', 'star', 'Can', 'millionaire', 'starring', 'role', 'girlfriend', 'today', 'great', 'wealth', 'power', 'lead', 'corruption', 'insanity', 'Was', 'Kane', 'search', 'love', 'result', 'unhappy', 'childhood', 'Charlie', 'vandalism', 'wife', 'bedroom', 'sick', 'mind', 'inventory', 'Kane', 'property', 'What', 'worth', 'Kane', 'saved', 'everything', 'many', 'generation', 'end', 'see', 'child', 'sled', 'name.This', 'film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'novel', 'day', 'now', 'dated', 'came', 'radio', 'play', 'not', 'really', 'historical', 'satirical', 'were', 'plenty', 'other', 'targets', 'available', 'film', 'barely', 'events', 'existed', 'Kane', 'lifetime', 'post', 'Civil', 'War', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'fictionalized', 'account', 'closer', 'reality', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better.Since', 'died', 'alone', 'how', 'did', 'anyone', 'learn', 'last', 'word']",N/A

297300,A18BD98SU49UB7,6302135621,"Adam Hunnicutt ""A.H.""","[20, 25]","A few weeks ago I had the astounding honor of fulfilling one of my lifelong goals; I met Roger Ebert.Me and my co-directing friend went to the Savannah Film festival with big cheezy grins on our faces. We were going to have a once in a lifetime opportunity to go through a shot-by-shot question and answer session with Roger Ebert. That in itself was incredible, and more than enough to keep this Alabama boy happy the rest of his days. I have spent the last decade reading his reviews, along with millions of other folks every week. He is arguably the number one personal source of information on Citizen Kane. So respected in fact, he was given the task to have an informative commentary track on the disk, which any fan of the film should listen to.We had to throw around a few bargains, but finally we krept our way to the front row. In front of me, the stool in which he was going to sit on. Most excellent, right? Wrong, that's nothing - just the beginning. Behind me, a voice was heard amongst the others in the packed theater. ""Thats where he sat last night."" To my amazement he was pointing to the chair directly beside me. I choked as they brought in a microphone and placed it in front of the seat to my right. I was going to watch what the American Film Institute calls ""the greatest movie of all time"", with one of the most respected Critics of all time.Sure enough, he came in and gave a brief bow. ""Peter O' Toole was here wednesday, and let me tell you, he is a pro at taking applause. First he gracefully entered bowing then, once he had sat down, he noticed the balcony, so he stood once more with a surprised expression on his face as if he didn't deserve it. He is the master."" Likewise he did so to the balcony.Ebert was very nice, and if he were to stop reviewing, he would have no trouble finding work as a stand-up comedian. Popping the Citizen Kane disk out and placing it in the player, he kept the crowd rolling with anecdotes. Anything from why watching weekly citcoms is a sin, to the absurdity of yearly sports. He is anti-cycle. ""Watching three episodes of Seinfield is a good thing. Watching every episode of seinfield is a waste of life. Watch a movie, listen to music, have a picnic, make love to your spouse... anything!""Ofcourse there were some unhappy groans, but hey, he was honest and unpolitically correct, which anyone should give him credit for. Finally, ""Lets get the movie going.""He sat down beside me. There was a brief exchange of nods as the lights went down. The rules to the question and answer session is, as the movie rolls if you have a comment or question you yell out ""STOP!"" And so he does, then the question is asked.I was able to decifer some of the unintelligable questions for Ebert, because it was a packed house and some of the voices were very faint. One person caused a laughing riot when he compared the little monkey dolls in the wife's room with the flying monkeys in the Wizard of Oz; As if there was some intentional link between them. Ebert replied, ""That is something you have to decide between you and your conspirator."" The voice lashed out, ""In this case, that would be you!"" ""Uh oh,"" Ebert laughed to himself.There were many facts unearthed during the session. Some that even he, after over a hundred viewings, hadn't realized. Such as ""the ranch"" mentioned earlier in the film held the same name as the bar his wife is drinking in during her talk with the newspaper man. Also shot in which main characters are seen as the camera pulls back through a window. A hand is barely seen removing a chair from the way of the camera. Very neat information for fans. These discoveries led to applause towards the discovering audience members. Later these were put in his own essay about the festival.""The sled in the film was purchased at auction by Steven Spielberg."" I was shocked. I leaned over to him, ""I was the one who sent you the e-mail about that when it happened."" He was surprised, ""Really?"" Then he want back to the Q and A. I supposed he was just humoring me, because he is no doubt use to the crazies out there. So I left it at that.Once the film ended and he had said his last words, the crowd stood up and raced towards him. To my surprise, he walked over to me, ""So, you sent me that e-mail?"" He really remembered. Out of all of the thousands of e-mails, he plucked from his memory, my letter. ""Yes sir,"" I said. ""Wow, and I replied right?"" he asked. ""Yes, you said 'thanks for the information'. That 'news about the sled interested you greatly'.""I knew the people standing around us were growing angry, but we continued to talk. After all was said and done, my friend and I received autograph's and a picture which you can see at hideawayfilms dot com. He gave us almost all the time he had, and for all of these things I am extremely grateful. I know it took an act of God to bring all of this together so perfectly, and to him I am forever in debt.Watching Citizen Kane was an incredible experience that everyone should take part in atleast once.

He ruled his empire like a king. The people that are in his life are treated like objects that can get him further. The documentary is the story of what happened when William Randolph Hearst found out about the film and thought it was about him.In terms of the film, it's done beautifully.

The innovations Welles and Toland made in the cinematography and as a director were years and years ahead of their time. The makeup and art direction is Oscar Worthy. Even Robert Wise's editing was well done. Welles use lighting, the deep focus, long takes, and low angles was revolutionary. Sure, there are several plot holes and continuity goes all to hell, but you don't notice it. That's how much the movie captures you visually, and with the superb acting from Welles, Joseph Cotton, Everette Sloan, and Dorothy Comingore you don't notice until you've seen it several times. Oh, and before I forget, Hermann was the composer.The DVD itself has a lot of great features, this is how a DVD should be made. It is a 2 disc set that is packaged beautifully in a slipcover case. There is commentary from Roger Ebert (who really analysis the film for you) and Peter Bogdanovitch, who was apparently a friend of Welles and has alot of great insights. You also get quick interviews with Ruth Warwick (the actress to portraits Kane's first wife) and Robert Wise (editor).One major problem with the DVD is that in the storyboards, production stills, and call sheets you have no control over how fast they go. pretty much at the mercy of the DVD.Disc 2 contains a 2 hour documentary on the Battle for Citizen Kane between Welles and Hearst.It Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made?

Prior to my viewings of the film, a few of my friends(who also take a keen interest in films) urged me to watch it attentively.  Having seen the film twice now, I can't help but doubt film-critics calling this film the best of all time.  Perhaps this is a result of my youth and ignorance, but I suspect the movie has aged poorly and that people of my generation will never truly appreciate this film.Citizen Kane meets all the criteria of a classic film, the most important of which is: it deals with themes that are universal.  That is, Kane's ambitions, the corruption of politicians, and the general human desire to be loved.  Unfortunately, Welles makes a few missteps in executing these ideas and he tends to concentrate on irrelevancies such as his second wife's attempt at becoming an opera singer.  Perhaps some movie-goers find this suitable, but it is my firm conviction that a film should include scenes which are relevant to the development of the film, and that everything else should be scrapped.  Had Welles concentrated further on his Newspaper organization, and less on his domestic affairs, the plot would seem a lot more coherent.  As a result, it is not clear exactly what Welles is trying to say with this film.  With films like The Godfather, the implications were clear: organized crime is another form of American business.  Taxi Driver implies that loneliness is an ineviatable state of the human race.  This film on the other hand, can't quite make up its mind as to what it wants to get across.My own feeling is that this film has too many flaws to be really considered on the same level as say ""The Godfather"", ""Seven Samurai"", or ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".  The crucial difference being, not only do those films know what they want to say, but the manner in which they say those things is meticulous and free of any redundant words.",3,I'll be fair,1115251200,"05 5, 2005",2005,1955,"['have', 'seen', 'film', 'top', 'nearly', 'film', 'list', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Prior', 'viewings', 'film', 'few', 'friends', 'who', 'also', 'take', 'keen', 'interest', 'films', 'urged', 'watch', 'attentively', 'Having', 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'now', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'doubt', 'film-critics', 'calling', 'film', 'best', 'time', 'Perhaps', 'result', 'youth', 'ignorance', 'suspect', 'movie', 'aged', 'poorly', 'people', 'generation', 'will', 'never', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'film.Citizen', 'Kane', 'meets', 'criteria', 'classic', 'film', 'most', 'important', 'themes', 'are', 'universal', 'Kane', 'ambitions', 'corruption', 'politicians', 'general', 'human', 'desire', 'be', 'loved', 'Unfortunately', 'Welles', 'few', 'missteps', 'executing', 'ideas', 'concentrate', 'irrelevancies', 'such', 'second', 'wife', 'attempt', 'becoming', 'opera', 'singer', 'Perhaps', 'movie-goers', 'find', 'suitable', 'firm', 'conviction', 'film', 'should', 'include', 'scenes', 'are', 'relevant', 'development', 'film', 'everything', 'else', 'should', 'be', 'scrapped', 'Had', 'Welles', 'concentrated', 'further', 'Newspaper', 'organization', 'less', 'domestic', 'affairs', 'plot', 'would', 'seem', 'lot', 'more', 'coherent', 'result', 'not', 'clear', 'exactly', 'what', 'Welles', 'trying', 'say', 'film', 'films', 'Godfather', 'implications', 'were', 'clear', 'organized', 'crime', 'form', 'American', 'business', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'loneliness', 'ineviatable', 'state', 'human', 'race', 'film', 'other', 'hand', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'what', 'get', 'across.My', 'own', 'feeling', 'film', 'too', 'many', 'flaws', 'be', 'really', 'considered', 'same', 'level', 'say', 'Godfather', 'Seven', 'Samurai', 'One', 'flew', 'cuckoo', 'nest', 'crucial', 'difference', 'being', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'films', 'know', 'what', 'want', 'say', 'manner', 'say', 'things', 'meticulous', 'free', 'redundant', 'words']",N/A

Rather you are for it or against it one thing is certain the film can not be ignored. The plot is told in the opening credits through a newsreel flash forward after Kane's death, thus the information about the fims central character Charles Foster kane is established, the film then starts from Kane's early years of a child deprived of love to a wealthy newspaper tycoon adult void of a concious or a true &quot;love&quot; to call his own. But what makes kane an amazing film to watch is that it seems to be such an uninviting film to watch. Welles genius gives you this impossible figure for the viewer to empathize but as the film plays out you feel more than just disdain for the character but for the whole atmosphere of the film. Citizen Kane plays like a grown adults nightmare! Reality is twisted when the things in our adult life that we would love to own such as furs, diamonds and expensive homes are placed in Kane's lap and he not only loaths these material wishes but he buys nore and more of them as if one day they will magically fullfil the void he knows they can't fill. That is the magic and truth behind this flick Kane ultimately dies when all his materlistic needs are met and he suffocates in his need. Love, respect and happiness does pop into kanes life but when all is said and done the mere fact that Kane through out the entire film seems to relish the thoughts of wanteing to want makes Citizen Kane the most enjoyable film to dive into time and time again. And as for transition to DVD, the quality of the entire package is so well done and the picture so sharp you can actually count the whiskers on kane's face as he whispers his infamous dying words &quot;Rosebud&quot;! The film also includes the Oscar Nomintated &quot;The Battle Over Citizen Kane&quot; it details to great acord the war between Welles and Hearst (Kane is supposedly based on Hearst).

This will stimulate the nerves in  your retina that have obviously been deadened by episodes of &quot;the  worlds greatest car chases.&quot;  Although you may wish to rather view the  nightly news for more relevant stimuli, the notion that the  &quot;Rosebud&quot; plot of Citizen Kane is boring and been done, is well  taken.  However, I must confess igonorance to the subject.  Might this poor  player of a movie, be an original or dare I venture, an innovator of such a  genre?  While someone might indeed be able to find such filmmaking  techniques in &quot;A complete Idiots Guide to Filmmaking&quot; as you  suggest, I wonder whether those classic books were available at that time,  and why no modern filmmaker has seen fit to read them, as is evidenced by  the poorly shot, and poor plot films we are subject to today.  I saw  Citizen Kane recently, and though dissapointed there were no visable  explosions or gratuitous violence, was entertained to the point of thought  and retrospection.  The story in the film was not a special effect (a  departure I found unnerving) but rather a person, and the circumstance of  fame.  The filmmaking you mention as simple, did look pedestrian compared  to the computer graphics we see today, and one can only wonder why they  were once described as revolutionary.  I mean we see those shots in film  all the time today, so what was so special?  Despite it's obvious flaws,  the film remains probably the greatest ever.  It's just a shame, they  didn't have computer generation technology back then.  It would've made the  story of remembering one's innocence that much more compelling.  Maybe with  a character like Jar Jar, I would've felt his pain.  As the reviewer from  New York rightly states, this whole Rosebudgate has been done with better  flair with Watergate, Irangate, and Monicagate.  I mean, couldn't Mr.  Welles have learned from the sensationalism of the Watergate affair to make  a better movie?  I guess we will never know.

I am not so sure that I could say the same about director Orson Welles' 1941 film classic, Citizen Kane.Oh sure some of the technical stuff today could (and has on the remastered versions ) enhance the sound, and  maybe some of the production values but this magnificent film does not rely on technical skill so much (although some of the scenes and backdrops are of high quality) as the driving plot line, the script, and above the acting of director Orson Welles's merry band of Mercury Theater players (think Joseph Cotton, Agnes Moorehead, Everett Sloan and, oh yes, Orson Welles, among others).The plot line and the way it unfolds beginning with a clever news-of-the week video of Charles Foster Kane's life after he passed away to bring us  up to speed really is something to watch. Of course it did not hurt that this piece was a thinly-veiled portrait of the famed newspaperman and arch imperialist war-monger (the Spanish-American War and other little adventures be exact) William Randolph Hearst. He of ""yellow journalism"" fame although today he would be strictly minor league, maybe scandalous in Toledo or someplace like that.Then to have the strong cinematic personality of actor Orson Welles (shown as well in other films like Falstaff, The Lady From Shang-hai, and The Third Man) play that strong Hearst personality just added to the drama. As well as did the flashbacks by various parties who knew Kane, had worked for Kane, had loved Kane, had hated Kane or were just pure baffled by him. And then that dramatic undercurrent throughout the film of Kane's characteristic that would banish him from the godly pantheon, his utter incapacity to love anybody but himself that left him alone at the end. Yet he was still able to go back into deep childhood to remember the good part of his life, the part many of us harken back to as we age. We all, or almost all, have our Rosebud memories and maybe that is the connecting thread to the continuing relevance of this classic film.

Its about a newspaper tycoon , a very powerful man who inherits riches from his family and then goes into the newspaper business. It corrupts him. Makes him forget about the feelings of those around him. Though he says he cares he only cares about himself and the way others make him feel. The older he gets his world just starts coming apart due to the actions and mistakes he made on his part. The begining of the film he says rosebud and at the end we get to find out what rosebud is. It tells us everything yet tells us nothing at all at the same time. You have to think what exactly it could have meant and why. That one simple thing could have stood out before he died and the simple things in life. The meaning , etc.. I dont know many my age who could probably sit through Citizen Kane and follow it. Im 22 years old. It is very long and it might be boring to some my age. It was made in 41. I noticed the great camera shots and scenes throughout the movie. Orson was gifted to write , direct and star in such a good movie at such an early age. I admire the camera work and plot of the movie but I just wished they wouldve told us more about Rosebud and explained. But then again maybe that would take away from the movie , I think its meant to leave us with mystery about rosebud and to actually think about it. Serious film buffs will love this movie. The one reviewer called it an ( aquired taste). So I Would definetly rent this before you buy.

I just have to say a couple things about it, besides the fact that it is the greatest film ever made and it's perfect in every way, because we all know that.  I have a message for all the viewers...if you watch this movie and expect something entertaining then, you should just not watch this film at all...it is not meant to be entertaining.  It is like a work of art.  &quot;CITIZEN KANE&quot; is like Piscasso's Old Guitarist painting...it's not exactly the happiest most entertaining painting in the world but...IT'S GOOD!  This movie is one you don't just go to Blockbuster and pick up for a good Saturday night movie..NO NO! It is a film which needs to be studied ahead of time, watched very carefully, and probed into. This is a film which calls for the human mind to function on a higher level...much higher than the normal standard of thinking.  The camera shots- we know they are beautifully mapped out and have such an artistic value to them that you could take almost any still from this movie and hang it in a art museum! You need understand this movie...study each character...especially Kane...the title of the movie is &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; because underneath all that money, power, greed, and corruption- he is just a citizen, like you and me.  So, I suggest to anyone who wants to see this movie to ask someone about it...who has studied it before...ask them to explain it...My dad helped me alot in the understanding of this movie, as he does with many movies.  Once you understand this movie, it becomes MORE than a movie...it helps you understand all movies...and how character is crucial to plot, and how the camera angles and lighting is what makes a movie different from a play....it adds an artistic element to a motion picture that you cannot acheive in a play..and Orson Welles understands this, for he is the most important and brilliant film director to ever grace the screen with one of his films.  This picture single-handedly rises above all other pictures as a masterpiece of film...and it will remain that way forever because Welles is the Shakespeare of the motion picture, and just as there will never be another William Shakespeare, there will never be another Orson Welles.",5,MOST ARTISTIC MOVIE EVER MADE!,977270400,"12 20, 2000",2000,2268,"[""'m"", '15', 'years', 'old', 'just', 'recently', 'saw', 'movie', 'just', 'have', 'say', 'couple', 'things', 'fact', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'perfect', 'way', 'know', 'have', 'message', 'viewers', 'watch', 'movie', 'expect', 'something', 'entertaining', 'then', 'should', 'just', 'not', 'watch', 'film', 'not', 'meant', 'be', 'entertaining', 'work', 'art', 'quot', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'quot', 'Piscasso', 'Old', 'Guitarist', 'painting', 'not', 'exactly', 'happiest', 'most', 'entertaining', 'painting', 'world', 'IT', 'GOOD', 'movie', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'Blockbuster', 'pick', 'up', 'good', 'Saturday', 'night', 'movie..NO', 'NO', 'film', 'be', 'studied', 'ahead', 'time', 'watched', 'very', 'carefully', 'probed', 'film', 'human', 'mind', 'function', 'higher', 'level', 'much', 'higher', 'normal', 'standard', 'thinking', 'camera', 'shots-', 'know', 'are', 'beautifully', 'mapped', 'out', 'have', 'such', 'artistic', 'value', 'could', 'take', 'almost', 'still', 'movie', 'hang', 'art', 'museum', 'need', 'understand', 'movie', 'study', 'character', 'especially', 'Kane', 'title', 'movie', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'money', 'power', 'greed', 'corruption-', 'just', 'citizen', 'So', 'suggest', 'anyone', 'who', 'see', 'movie', 'ask', 'someone', 'who', 'studied', 'ask', 'explain', 'My', 'dad', 'helped', 'alot', 'understanding', 'movie', 'many', 'movies', 'Once', 'understand', 'movie', 'MORE', 'movie', 'understand', 'movies', 'how', 'character', 'crucial', 'plot', 'how', 'camera', 'angles', 'lighting', 'what', 'movie', 'different', 'play', '.it', 'artistic', 'element', 'motion', 'picture', 'can', 'not', 'acheive', 'play..and', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'most', 'important', 'brilliant', 'film', 'director', 'ever', 'grace', 'screen', 'one', 'films', 'picture', 'single-handedly', 'rises', 'other', 'pictures', 'masterpiece', 'film', 'will', 'remain', 'way', 'forever', 'Welles', 'Shakespeare', 'motion', 'picture', 'just', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'William', 'Shakespeare', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'Orson', 'Welles']",N/A

297320,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302135621,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 4]","Oh how the times have changed.A film that was in all actuality a box-office flop; critically panned and literally booed at the 14th annual Oscars; a film that received nine Oscar nominations yet only received one statuette (for screenplay) rises from the ashes of a pummeling demise to become considered the greatest American film of all time.  All too often this is the case; a film is either critically lauded or distained only to, with time, change the minds of the American public.  `Citizen Kane' rests comfortable at the top (the number one position) of AFI's list of the top 100 films ever made, and I don't see it dropping positions anytime soon (unless `The Godfather' sneaks in).  Personally, I feel that America got this right; the second time.While I personally prefer Coppola's `gangster' masterpiece I feel that `Citizen Kane' is a marvelous example of perfected cinema, an entertaining and enlightening film that stands the test of time and in all actuality gets better as the years roll by.The film opens the fragile whisper of the word ""Rosebud"" before it explodes with the exclamation of newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's death.  The film revolves around a news reporter trying to uncover the meaning behind Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"".  What that reporter finds though is that no man's life can be summed up with one word.I find that revelation to be supremely important and universally reaching.  The whole of `Citizen Kane' can be summed up in the realization that no man can be fully understood without fully understanding where he came from, what he strived for and ultimately what he became.  As this reporter interviews those closest to Kane, those who loved and or hated him, he (as well as we) gets a beautifully well rounded and complete picture of the man that was Charles Foster Kane.  We get an inside look at his professional life as well as his personal life; his friends, his wives, his business partners.  We get to see how Kane interacted with others, how he dealt with those close to him and even those who peered down at him with evil intent; but as the film draws to its close we realize that the one thing we never got to see is the one missing link to fully grasping `who' Charles Foster Kane really was.That is his `rosebud'.Sure, `Citizen Kane', in the process of exposing this man, delves into the politics of corruption and greed, wealth and power, but it's the underlying message that floats to the surface and becomes the true root of the film.  When one walks away from this film he is left with a reflective work of deep meaning and everlasting presence; a universal message that touches the foundations of humanity and dwells eternally in the bowels of those privileged to witness this masterpiece.The first thing I noticed about `Citizen Kane' was its visual styling.  This is a film that feels up-to-date all the way around.  I'm fully convinced that this film could be released this year and it would hold up strongly against the world of modern cinema.  You know how some films feel dated?  `Citizen Kane' is not that film.Another facet of `Citizen Kane' that is stellar beyond compare is that of the acting, especially on the part of the films writer, director and star Orson Welles.  Welles is charismatic, natural and convincing.  He gives a masterfully well rounded and committed performance that stands tall as one of the finest male performances of all time.  Seriously, how he lost the acting Oscar is beyond me.  How this movie lost any of the Oscars it was snubbed for; Best Actor, Best Director, Best Picture, Score, Film Editing, Cinematography, Art Direction and Sound Recording; is beyond me.  At least it was honored with the Screenplay Oscar, but still, that's such a token award for such a marvelous film.`Citizen Kane' is lauded as one of the greatest, as the greatest even, and I have to jump on that bandwagon and let my voice be heard.  This is a revelation, an iconic piece of cinema that is sure to prove supremely entertaining and rewarding to the viewer.  The film is paced beautifully, never loses the audience's attention or appreciation and, as I mentioned, just gets better and better every time you watch it.  Orson Welles had a vision, a marvelous vision at that, and while it was not fully understood or appreciated upon its release, he can `rest in peace' now, fully aware that his vision will never be forgotten.",5,"A cinematic staple; a film that stands the test of time, proving to be one of the greatest...",1209081600,"04 25, 2008",2008,4404,"['Oh', 'how', 'times', 'have', 'changed.A', 'film', 'was', 'actuality', 'box-office', 'flop', 'critically', 'panned', 'literally', 'booed', '14th', 'annual', 'Oscars', 'film', 'received', 'nine', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'yet', 'only', 'received', 'one', 'statuette', 'screenplay', 'ashes', 'pummeling', 'demise', 'become', 'considered', 'greatest', 'American', 'film', 'time', 'too', 'often', 'case', 'film', 'critically', 'lauded', 'distained', 'only', 'time', 'change', 'minds', 'American', 'public', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'rests', 'comfortable', 'top', 'number', 'one', 'position', 'AFI', 'list', 'top', '100', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'dropping', 'positions', 'anytime', 'soon', 'Godfather', 'sneaks', 'Personally', 'feel', 'America', 'got', 'right', 'second', 'time.While', 'personally', 'prefer', 'Coppola', 'gangster', 'masterpiece', 'feel', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'marvelous', 'example', 'perfected', 'cinema', 'entertaining', 'enlightening', 'film', 'test', 'time', 'actuality', 'better', 'years', 'roll', 'by.The', 'film', 'fragile', 'whisper', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'exclamation', 'newspaper', 'tycoon', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'death', 'film', 'around', 'news', 'reporter', 'trying', 'uncover', 'meaning', 'Kane', 'last', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'What', 'reporter', 'finds', 'man', 'life', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'one', 'word.I', 'find', 'revelation', 'be', 'supremely', 'important', 'universally', 'reaching', 'whole', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'can', 'be', 'summed', 'up', 'realization', 'man', 'can', 'be', 'fully', 'understood', 'fully', 'understanding', 'where', 'came', 'what', 'strived', 'ultimately', 'what', 'became', 'reporter', 'interviews', 'closest', 'Kane', 'who', 'loved', 'hated', 'as', 'well', 'beautifully', 'well', 'rounded', 'complete', 'picture', 'man', 'was', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'get', 'inside', 'look', 'professional', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'personal', 'life', 'friends', 'wives', 'business', 'partners', 'get', 'see', 'how', 'Kane', 'interacted', 'others', 'how', 'close', 'even', 'who', 'peered', 'down', 'evil', 'intent', 'film', 'close', 'realize', 'one', 'thing', 'never', 'got', 'see', 'one', 'missing', 'link', 'fully', 'grasping', 'who', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'really', 'was.That', ""rosebud'.Sure"", 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'process', 'exposing', 'man', 'politics', 'corruption', 'greed', 'wealth', 'power', 'underlying', 'message', 'surface', 'true', 'root', 'film', 'When', 'one', 'away', 'film', 'left', 'reflective', 'work', 'deep', 'meaning', 'everlasting', 'presence', 'universal', 'message', 'foundations', 'humanity', 'dwells', 'eternally', 'bowels', 'privileged', 'witness', 'masterpiece.The', 'first', 'thing', 'noticed', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'visual', 'styling', 'film', 'up-to-date', 'way', ""'m"", 'fully', 'convinced', 'film', 'could', 'be', 'released', 'year', 'would', 'hold', 'up', 'strongly', 'world', 'modern', 'cinema', 'know', 'how', 'films', 'feel', 'dated', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'not', 'film.Another', 'facet', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'stellar', 'compare', 'acting', 'especially', 'part', 'films', 'writer', 'director', 'star', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Welles', 'charismatic', 'natural', 'convincing', 'masterfully', 'well', 'rounded', 'committed', 'performance', 'tall', 'one', 'finest', 'male', 'performances', 'time', 'Seriously', 'how', 'lost', 'acting', 'Oscar', 'How', 'movie', 'lost', 'Oscars', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Best', 'Director', 'Best', 'Picture', 'Score', 'Film', 'Editing', 'Cinematography', 'Art', 'Direction', 'Sound', 'Recording', 'least', 'was', 'honored', 'Screenplay', 'Oscar', 'still', 'token', 'award', 'such', 'marvelous', 'film.', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'lauded', 'one', 'greatest', 'greatest', 'even', 'have', 'jump', 'bandwagon', 'let', 'voice', 'be', 'heard', 'revelation', 'iconic', 'piece', 'cinema', 'sure', 'prove', 'supremely', 'entertaining', 'rewarding', 'viewer', 'film', 'paced', 'beautifully', 'never', 'audience', 'attention', 'appreciation', 'mentioned', 'just', 'better', 'better', 'time', 'watch', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'had', 'vision', 'marvelous', 'vision', 'was', 'not', 'fully', 'understood', 'appreciated', 'release', 'can', 'rest', 'peace', 'now', 'fully', 'aware', 'vision', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten']",N/A

The five star reviews are from those who are either old enough to remember the film when it was new, fresh and incredibly important because of its innovations in film-making, or can enjoy a movie for how it influenced the film-making process since its release. The one star reviews are from the young who simply can't see what the fuss is about for an 'old' film which, of course, technically does not compare to the CGI and effects processes available to film-makers today. No ""rush"" to be had except from thought - buy why should a movie involve cognitive work as movies are just for entertainment? Right? The best movie of all time? To make this distinction does NOT involve comparing it to a modern film one on one for technical values, acting, etc because you simply can not do that. Apples to elephants so to speak. But how the film influences the medium, relates to its ""then"" surroundings, shows innovation - all these reflect the greatness of a film. And it is hard to fault Citizen Kane on these grounds. An audience member's personal liking for the subject matter of a film can not be used to properly rate a film, except for a rating of that person's experience. If a person individually does not like a film, it does not accurately reflect the film's effect on any other person - nor its importance in the scheme of things.

But here's my guess (it could be wrong or maybe there are several answers):It tells the story of someone who as a child had fortune thrust upon him and as a man tried to use it to do perhaps the one thing it could never do: buy people's love. Initially we think his enormous wealth is a blessing but by the end we know that it is a curse (and he knows it as well).

It's because it illustrates the theme so amazingly well with Welles' landmark portrayal of Charles Foster Kane. It is believable, which is the highest compliment anyone can pay to a job an actor does. You see Kane as a real person, and like the guys in the movie, you try to understand him - but you can't. Kane is a man who's desperate to be loved, but who himself is incapable of loving anyone. The result is that when he dies, there's utterly no one to remember him, and no one that has ever understood him - themes and images near and dear to my heart.The reporters in the movie are trying to figure out what Kane meant with his dying words. In the process, they try to figure out Kane himself, but they fail, because no one was close enough to Kane to understand. Kane is a man who, despite having amassed unbelievable wealth, has wasted his entire life. He has no appreciation of art or culture or beauty even though he collects statues, builds opera houses, and marries beautiful women. His life is concentrated on &quot;getting stuff&quot; for no real reason. There's an amazing scene in the end where his wealth is just lying in piles and some workers just throw it in the fireplace (since no one wants to buy it). Everything is really expensive - finely crafted chairs, Oriental rugs, paintings - but there's so much of it and it's all in piles, so it looks like trash. And that's the point of the movie - the American Dream as it's commonly known is hollow.Of course, all that would just be preaching if not for Welles' performance, which is outstanding, and creates a truly powerful film.

Hearst during a dinner party at the tycoon's enormous California estate. Welles supposedly included ""Rosebud"" in his semi-bio of Hearst to embarrass the man. This mysterious word was the publisher's nickname for an intimate body part belonging to his mistress, Marion Davies. (BTW... watch closely in the film's early snow scene for a revealing ""Rosebud"" hint, when young Kane hits a visitor with his beloved sled and we see the famous flower insignia on it.)Is this picture, as so many claim, THE GREATEST ever made?

It is simply because it is still, over half a century later, an astonishing piece of work.  Absolutely stunning, using every trick &amp; device ever invented in movie making, and coming at them with such freshness and originality, decontructing and reconstructing them into something new &amp; unique, that the word &quot;genius&quot; was invented to describe such efforts.I dislike how that word genius is bandied about so much today describing everything from gifted natural athletes to clever comedians and politicians.  I rarely use it myself.  But, if this wasn't a work of genius, I don't know what would qualify.  This is such a grown-up movie, telling an archetypal American story, but with brilliance in every frame and every line of dialogue.  Is is so mature a work, made under the strictures of the Hayes code, that it makes most of what we see today, without virtually any limits, look like the work of children.AND it was made with such economy!

If you don't &quot;get it&quot; if you find it &quot;boring&quot; nothing I say will change your mind.  I will say this, if that is  your reaction, you know nothing about film-making.  Citizen Kane is an exhaustive primer in brilliant film-making.  Welles threw in the kitchen sink!  That it was a 25 year old's first movie , while not important to your enjoyment or appreciation of the film, is finally just awsome.  The continual inventiveness in scene after scene is dizzying.The DVD has lots of goodies.  An excellent documentary on the background of the struggle to make and release the film and William Randolph Hearst's (somewhat understandable) effort to destroy it.  There are comments and even regrets by Welles...he was a young man tearing down an old man and there is cruelty in it.  There are 2 very different and excellent commentary tracks by Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert.  The former more a friend's recollections, the latter an intense analysis of the art of the film-making.  All in all, a very nice package.The restored film is beautiful.One of my oldest memories is sitting in front of a B&amp;W television mesmerized by the opening of Citizen Kane.  I must have been 10, and I don't recall if I watched it all, and certainly wouldn't have understood it all, but I was completely entranced by the sheer look of the film.  I had never seen anything like it.  It was pure Magic!  And &quot;magic&quot; it remains to film lovers the world over.

Kane could be seen as a hypocrite--championing the workingman and fighting for his interests, while at the same time employing the tactics of those he rails against (the rich, privileged, and powerful).  But at heart, he is just a man looking for love and acceptance (from friends, family--particularly his mother, who sent him away at 10 years of age--and the people).  And because it never works out for him, he takes his losses in the most personal way, until finally he is consumed by it and it takes its toll on him (symbolized by the Rosebud sled being consumed once and for all by the flames of the furnace).  Rosebud was, indeed, something he lost--his link to his childhood and it would forever have an impact on him.We had to watch this movie for an English class in college, and I've been intrigued by it ever since--perhaps because, deep down, there's a little Charlie Kane in all of us.",5,I really enjoyed this movie...,1217635200,"08 2, 2008",2008,1174,"['thought', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'written', 'produced', 'glimpse', 'life', 'big', 'American', 'Thompson', 'boss', 'Rawlston', 'pointed', 'out', 'ultimately', 'story', 'how', 'consumed', 'can', 'become', 'own', 'demons', 'allow', 'overtake', 'Kane', 'could', 'be', 'seen', 'hypocrite', 'championing', 'workingman', 'fighting', 'interests', 'same', 'time', 'employing', 'tactics', 'rich', 'privileged', 'powerful', 'heart', 'just', 'man', 'looking', 'love', 'acceptance', 'friends', 'family', 'particularly', 'mother', 'who', 'sent', 'away', '10', 'years', 'age', 'people', 'never', 'out', 'losses', 'most', 'personal', 'way', 'finally', 'consumed', 'toll', 'symbolized', 'Rosebud', 'sled', 'being', 'consumed', 'once', 'flames', 'furnace', 'Rosebud', 'was', 'indeed', 'something', 'lost', 'link', 'childhood', 'would', 'forever', 'have', 'impact', 'him.We', 'had', 'watch', 'movie', 'English', 'class', 'college', ""'ve"", 'been', 'intrigued', 'ever', 'perhaps', 'deep', 'down', 'little', 'Charlie', 'Kane']",N/A

Watching Citizen Kane alone isn't enough because it is not possible to see it of a masterpiece, and you will end up finding it an ordinary film. But knowing and understanding the background that led to Citizen Kane, it becomes more clear and understandable why it is a masterpiece. The film is very strong, powerful, and picturesque. Orson Welles did a brilliant job of portraying Charles Foster Kane, the evil magnate of immense power and wealth. The character was a villain because he never understood what it is like to be a human. When Charles failed to do that, he became a bigger and bigger monster until he fully realized that he actually hated what he had become of, and that's the brilliance behind Citizen Kane. It's not even about the sled per se but rather the huge concept behind that sled. Citizen Kane is about the loss of happiness that would never be regained. This is not as easy as it sounds, but Orson Welles did it. That was in 1941, and sixty-five years later, Citizen Kane is still a stunning picture.4/12: Orson Welles reaches the top on his first try, and he has never been the same since. Citizen Kane does put things into perspective. It is an important film for a numerous of reasons. Moreover, it's one of the best cinematographically shot picture. The film really says it all through its manipulation of vision to unfold a story. The controversy behind the film, most especially how the plot was constructed, is probably even bigger than the film per se, and that is what makes Citizen Kane a compelling picture to watch.

As I said before, I have tried to watch this film many, many times and I fall asleep within the first twenty minutes.  To say this it is overrated is an understatement in my opinion.  Classic it may be but it certainly doesn't deserve the title of the best film ever made.  How can we honestly compare this to the grandeur and scope of ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Sound of Music"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", or ""The Ten Commandments""?  There aren't even any big names so to speak of in this film.  Why haven't I been able to get into it??  Perhaps I just don't understand its message.  Perhaps the slow moving plot is to blame.

297338,AKQ0G0QFW3BF,6302135621,A. Warren,"[7, 7]","Some reviewers have commented on the ""snobbery"" of some reviewers when reviewing Citizen Kane. I sympathize. But it seems to me that those who take any knock against this film so personally do so for very valid reasons. I knew plenty of what are considered the ""finest"" films before I watched Citizen Kane, and even enjoyed some of them. However, I perhaps knew very little of film craft and technique, lighting, composition, etc. before I finally sat down and watched Kane.Like many have said before me (Ebert and and a whole posse of film critics online, CHUD for instance), it was Citizen Kane that made me a - I cringe while stating this! - ""film buff."" I assume the feeling is likewise with many of the reviewers here. Quite simply, so many movies by so many directors/cinematographers/actors would have passed by me along with their emotional resonance, if it wasn't for Citizen Kane.It's true; you can enjoy Citizen Kane without trying to notice the innovations that Welles unleashes. It is a brilliantly entertaining story and still one of the best examples of non-linear storytelling (is that too snobby?). But the beauty here is in the details and the way Welles actually _makes_ that emotional resonance happen.The reason so many people get so personal about this movie is because Citizen Kane is a cinematic gateway drug of sorts. I watched Citizen Kane, and I got it, and from there on in, I found it increasingly harder to be sated by the severely below-average movies that are being pushed on audiences now. I jumped to the Kubricks, the Bergmans, the Renoirs, the Langs, the Quays(s?), the Fellinis, the Melvilles, the Kurosawas, and blah blah blah. Most importantly, _I got it_, and it's because of Citizen Kane.I don't think that the average filmgoer has to know the ins and outs of editing and direction and cinematography in order to enjoy some of the movies that are considered the ""finest"" ever made. But it certainly helps, and it more than pays for the effort. It makes you a much more attentive filmgoer, at the very least. It was when I first watched Kane that I asked myself questions like, ""How in the world did the camera move through that table? Has lil' Kane been in the window frame this entire time? Oh my god, has that lit window been in the same place the entire time (even its reflection, no less!)? Where the hell are the boom mics? Why is there a gigantic portrait of Kane in every other conversational scene? Have I ever seen a deep focus shot before?""There is a reason Kane is still atop the AFI's 100 Best list. It is a 5-star movie, through and through. And if you have any idea about the amount of #*$& that Welles went through in his life just to finish his movies (if he even managed that), you'll know that he deserves that top spot more than anybody else. I think that there are better movies out there at this point, I think that Welles himself even did better movies than Kane, but Kane is still one of the best. It is a marvel that this movie still has the power to turn an inattentive college student into a perfectly attentive filmgoer. And hell, I still like Michael Bay's ""The Rock""...This movie deserves 5 Stars, nothing less.",5,4 Stars???,1185840000,"07 31, 2007",2007,3181,"['reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'snobbery', 'reviewers', 'when', 'reviewing', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'sympathize', 'who', 'take', 'knock', 'film', 'so', 'personally', 'do', 'so', 'very', 'valid', 'reasons', 'knew', 'plenty', 'what', 'are', 'considered', 'finest', 'films', 'watched', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'even', 'enjoyed', 'However', 'perhaps', 'knew', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'craft', 'technique', 'lighting', 'composition', 'etc', 'finally', 'sat', 'down', 'watched', 'Kane.Like', 'many', 'have', 'said', 'Ebert', 'whole', 'posse', 'film', 'critics', 'online', 'CHUD', 'instance', 'was', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'made', 'cringe', 'stating', 'film', 'buff', 'assume', 'feeling', 'likewise', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Quite', 'simply', 'so', 'many', 'movies', 'so', 'many', 'directors/cinematographers/actors', 'would', 'have', 'passed', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'was', ""n't"", 'Citizen', 'Kane.It', 'true', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'trying', 'notice', 'innovations', 'Welles', 'brilliantly', 'entertaining', 'story', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'examples', 'non-linear', 'storytelling', 'too', 'snobby', 'beauty', 'here', 'details', 'way', 'Welles', 'actually', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'happen.The', 'reason', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'get', 'so', 'personal', 'movie', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'cinematic', 'gateway', 'drug', 'sorts', 'watched', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'got', 'there', 'found', 'increasingly', 'harder', 'be', 'sated', 'severely', 'below-average', 'movies', 'are', 'being', 'pushed', 'audiences', 'now', 'jumped', 'Kubricks', 'Bergmans', 'Renoirs', 'Langs', 'Quays', 's', 'Fellinis', 'Melvilles', 'Kurosawas', 'blah', 'blah', 'blah', 'Most', 'importantly', '_I', 'got', 'it_', 'Citizen', 'Kane.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'average', 'filmgoer', 'know', 'ins', 'outs', 'editing', 'direction', 'cinematography', 'order', 'enjoy', 'movies', 'are', 'considered', 'finest', 'ever', 'made', 'certainly', 'more', 'pays', 'effort', 'much', 'more', 'attentive', 'filmgoer', 'very', 'least', 'was', 'when', 'first', 'watched', 'Kane', 'asked', 'questions', 'How', 'world', 'did', 'camera', 'move', 'table', 'Has', 'lil', 'Kane', 'been', 'window', 'frame', 'entire', 'time', 'Oh', 'god', 'lit', 'window', 'been', 'same', 'place', 'entire', 'time', 'even', 'reflection', 'less', 'Where', 'hell', 'are', 'boom', 'mics', 'Why', 'there', 'gigantic', 'portrait', 'Kane', 'other', 'conversational', 'scene', 'Have', 'ever', 'seen', 'deep', 'focus', 'shot', 'reason', 'Kane', 'still', 'atop', 'AFI', '100', 'Best', 'list', '5-star', 'movie', 'have', 'idea', 'amount', '*', 'Welles', 'went', 'life', 'just', 'finish', 'movies', 'even', 'managed', ""'ll"", 'know', 'top', 'spot', 'more', 'anybody', 'else', 'think', 'are', 'better', 'movies', 'there', 'point', 'think', 'even', 'did', 'better', 'movies', 'Kane', 'Kane', 'still', 'one', 'best', 'marvel', 'movie', 'still', 'power', 'turn', 'inattentive', 'college', 'student', 'perfectly', 'attentive', 'filmgoer', 'hell', 'still', 'Michael', 'Bay', 'Rock', 'movie', '5', 'Stars', 'nothing', 'less']",N/A

'Citizen Kane' is not only the best American film of all time, how it was born is one of the great all-time stories of film.The plot of the film, the rise and fall of multi-millionaire and newspaper emperor Charles Foster Kane, is known to most fans of film...So what makes it so great?  I think lots of people will tell you that Welles' innovative camera angles, beautiful cinematography, great Mercury Players all contribute to the brilliance of the film.  For me, though, no film has ever been a better study of the best and worst of human nature.  Kane (and Welles too, for that matter) was an extremely gifted man who was able to control nearly everything he touched.  What so many of us wouldn't give to have what Kane had.  Kane never asks the question on-screen, but you know what is going through his mind:  &quot;Is this all there is?&quot;  What a powerful study of a man of power and influence.'Citizen Kane' is such a film of staggering proportions, it has been imitated countless times, but never equalled.  Welles truly was a genius and even if he never surpassed 'Kane' himself, the film will continue to live on as the standard against which all other films are measured.  It is truly greatness.But there's more.  'The Battle Over Citizen Kane,' the second disc is just as great as the feature.  The story behind the film is an amazingly informative and entertaining feature.  See how 'Kane' came to life and how it almost died before it was ever born.  An amazing tale.

297340,A10EH95EUDO9W3,6302135621,"Banshee ""Beeyotch""","[1, 2]","I saw this old classic produced by the extremely young Orson Welles (who was also famous for causing a big Mars-invasion scare back in 1938) in my film class years ago. Though I sluggishly waded through this seemingly  meaningless film, I was nevertheless quite impressed by the incredibly  elegant mansion that Mr. Kane once lived in. And then later on, I read the  script all about this movie. Thus I truly understood its contents as well  as the protrayal of the real-life William Rudolph Hearst behind it. In  addition, this old film was supposed to be a revolutionary of its time,  when very simple props were efficiently used to create utterly believable  settings as well as to tell a believable story about a certain gentleman of  the early 20th century.This story all begun with an innocent little boy  playing on his sled in the snow during the 1870s or so as his stern-looking  mother patiently looked on. Then he grew up to become a newspaper emperor  and married a wife at the turn of the century, yet suffered from a very  loveless marriage. So he then courted a very pretty young girl who wanted  to be an opera singer, yet she simply did not prossess such talent or  skills. But Mr. Kane used his great influence and wealth to promote the  naive little girl into a very gaudy role complete with a real operahouse  and all. Unfortunately, the whole audience suffered from her terrible  voice, yet could not say anything about it lest they rouse the great Kane's  wrath. In addition, Mr. Kane built a very fancy palace for his young  mistress, who eventually could not stand his suffocating arrogance. So in  the very end, she simply packed up and walked right out, thus the very  furious old man really ripped up her room, destroying everything in  sight,...but the little old snowglobe that suddenly sent a nostalgic shard  right through his heart: a miniature setting of his childhood home. So - he  cried out the famous word, &quot;Rosebud&quot; before finally passing away.  A very sad picture of a proud but unhappy man.Though there are indeed  many viewers who may not get this old movie at all, yet it did inspire a  great deal on the future generations yet to come as well as the famous  painting, &quot;Scream&quot; does. For instance, Matt Groening, the creator  of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; makes a great many references to &quot;Citizen  Kane&quot; especially with Mr. Burns, the overaged, superrich old boss at  Homer Simpson's work. Now this is a good example of why this old flick  straight out of the WWII period continues to be one of the most acclaimed  movies of the 20th century.",4,"If you learn the story behind this movie, you may like it.",959558400,"05 29, 2000",2000,2613,"['saw', 'old', 'classic', 'produced', 'extremely', 'young', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'famous', 'causing', 'big', 'Mars-invasion', 'scare', 'back', '1938', 'film', 'class', 'years', 'ago', 'sluggishly', 'waded', 'seemingly', 'meaningless', 'film', 'was', 'nevertheless', 'quite', 'impressed', 'incredibly', 'elegant', 'mansion', 'Mr.', 'Kane', 'once', 'lived', 'then', 'later', 'read', 'script', 'movie', 'Thus', 'truly', 'understood', 'contents', 'as', 'well', 'protrayal', 'real-life', 'William', 'Rudolph', 'Hearst', 'addition', 'old', 'film', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'time', 'when', 'very', 'simple', 'props', 'were', 'efficiently', 'used', 'create', 'utterly', 'believable', 'settings', 'as', 'well', 'tell', 'believable', 'story', 'certain', 'gentleman', 'early', '20th', 'century.This', 'story', 'begun', 'innocent', 'little', 'boy', 'playing', 'sled', 'snow', '1870s', 'so', 'stern-looking', 'mother', 'patiently', 'looked', 'Then', 'grew', 'up', 'become', 'newspaper', 'emperor', 'married', 'wife', 'turn', 'century', 'yet', 'suffered', 'very', 'loveless', 'marriage', 'then', 'courted', 'very', 'pretty', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'wanted', 'be', 'opera', 'singer', 'simply', 'did', 'not', 'prossess', 'such', 'talent', 'skills', 'Mr.', 'Kane', 'used', 'great', 'influence', 'wealth', 'promote', 'naive', 'little', 'girl', 'very', 'gaudy', 'role', 'complete', 'real', 'operahouse', 'Unfortunately', 'whole', 'audience', 'suffered', 'terrible', 'voice', 'yet', 'could', 'not', 'say', 'anything', 'lest', 'rouse', 'great', 'Kane', 'wrath', 'addition', 'Mr.', 'Kane', 'built', 'very', 'fancy', 'palace', 'young', 'mistress', 'who', 'eventually', 'could', 'not', 'stand', 'suffocating', 'arrogance', 'So', 'very', 'end', 'simply', 'packed', 'up', 'walked', 'right', 'out', 'thus', 'very', 'furious', 'old', 'man', 'really', 'ripped', 'up', 'room', 'destroying', 'everything', 'sight', 'little', 'old', 'snowglobe', 'suddenly', 'sent', 'nostalgic', 'shard', 'right', 'heart', 'miniature', 'setting', 'childhood', 'home', 'So', 'cried', 'out', 'famous', 'word', 'quot', 'Rosebud', 'quot', 'finally', 'passing', 'away', 'very', 'sad', 'picture', 'proud', 'unhappy', 'are', 'indeed', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'get', 'old', 'movie', 'did', 'inspire', 'great', 'deal', 'future', 'generations', 'yet', 'come', 'as', 'well', 'famous', 'painting', 'quot', 'Scream', 'quot', 'instance', 'Matt', 'Groening', 'creator', 'quot', 'Simpsons', 'quot', 'great', 'many', 'references', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'especially', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'overaged', 'superrich', 'old', 'boss', 'Homer', 'Simpson', 'work', 'Now', 'good', 'example', 'why', 'old', 'flick', 'straight', 'WWII', 'period', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'acclaimed', 'movies', '20th', 'century']",N/A
297341,ANGH6401L9Y0T,6302135621,"Barbara Frederick ""auntb93""","[0, 0]","This is a 2-disc special edition, and I'm thinking maybe the special ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" is almost as interesting as the original movie. The point is made that this movie constituted a battle between two enormous egos, two enormously successful men: William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles. Hearst was old by that time, and Welles was young. Hearst's empire you know about. Welles had been amazingly successful in radio and producing plays in New York. He was signed to an unprecedented contract with RKO when he came to Hollywood in 1939. The script of ""Kane"" was leaked to Hearst, and a huge battle ensued. Interestingly, he was not nearly so upset about the film's portrayal of himself as of his second wife -- that is, Kane's second wife; I'm not sure Hearst ever married the woman he lived with who was represented by Kane's second wife. Hearst managed to have RKO stop distribution of the film, so it did not become known outside of art-film theaters and college film-making courses until much later.The story opens with the death of Kane, and everything from there on is about reporters attempting to follow up on the mystery behind Kane's last word: ""Rosebud."" So there are interviews with the people who were important in Kane's life, and then flashbacks as they tell their stories. It's an effective way to tell a story which may have been original with this film. We are talking about a film released in 1941, after all. In fact, I think many things were either original to this film or developed into now-classic movie techniques by the film. For example, Kane gazes on a picture of the ""best of the best"" in his rival newspaper, which then morphs into a live grouping of the same men as they are being photographed upon their coming to work for Kane. Kane (Welles was a young and quite handsome man at the time) smiles and jokes charmingly over the fact that it took him six years to get what he wanted.Another interesting technique is a series of identically staged scenes that come immediately after one close associate comments that Kane's first wife probably rarely saw him except at breakfast. They both get older and fatter, their clothes become more expensive and elaborate, the opulent conditions in which they have their breakfast are more and more opulent, and she becomes more and more nagging and shrill. So we know it's over time, and the strong impression is that she grew increasingly bitchy and he grew increasingly tired of her. Very effective story-telling for what probably only lasts two minutes.There were enough differences between Hearst's life and Kane's that if he had wanted to, Welles could have fallen back on the old ""it's only fiction"" line in his battle with Hearst. But both were way too egotistical to allow any compromise. As the movie progresses, you can't help wondering who can be said to have won the battle in the long run.I'm going along with the critics who have said this is one of the best films ever made, but a bit too serious and demanding of its audience to ever be one of the most popular.",4,A Historically Significant Film,1337385600,"05 19, 2012",2012,3062,"['2-disc', 'special', 'edition', ""'m"", 'thinking', 'maybe', 'special', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'almost', 'as', 'interesting', 'original', 'movie', 'point', 'made', 'movie', 'constituted', 'battle', 'two', 'enormous', 'egos', 'two', 'enormously', 'successful', 'men', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Hearst', 'was', 'old', 'time', 'Welles', 'was', 'young', 'Hearst', 'empire', 'know', 'Welles', 'had', 'been', 'amazingly', 'successful', 'radio', 'producing', 'plays', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'signed', 'unprecedented', 'contract', 'RKO', 'when', 'came', 'Hollywood', '1939', 'script', 'Kane', 'was', 'leaked', 'Hearst', 'huge', 'battle', 'ensued', 'Interestingly', 'was', 'not', 'nearly', 'so', 'upset', 'film', 'portrayal', 'second', 'wife', 'Kane', 'second', 'wife', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Hearst', 'ever', 'married', 'woman', 'lived', 'who', 'was', 'represented', 'Kane', 'second', 'wife', 'Hearst', 'managed', 'have', 'RKO', 'stop', 'distribution', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'known', 'art-film', 'theaters', 'college', 'film-making', 'courses', 'much', 'later.The', 'story', 'death', 'Kane', 'everything', 'there', 'reporters', 'attempting', 'follow', 'up', 'mystery', 'Kane', 'last', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'are', 'interviews', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'important', 'Kane', 'life', 'then', 'flashbacks', 'tell', 'stories', 'effective', 'way', 'tell', 'story', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'original', 'film', 'are', 'talking', 'film', 'released', '1941', 'fact', 'think', 'many', 'things', 'were', 'either', 'original', 'film', 'developed', 'now-classic', 'movie', 'techniques', 'film', 'example', 'Kane', 'picture', 'best', 'best', 'rival', 'newspaper', 'then', 'live', 'grouping', 'same', 'men', 'are', 'being', 'photographed', 'coming', 'work', 'Kane', 'Kane', 'Welles', 'was', 'young', 'quite', 'handsome', 'man', 'time', 'smiles', 'jokes', 'charmingly', 'fact', 'took', 'six', 'years', 'get', 'what', 'interesting', 'technique', 'series', 'identically', 'staged', 'scenes', 'come', 'immediately', 'one', 'close', 'associate', 'comments', 'Kane', 'first', 'wife', 'probably', 'rarely', 'saw', 'except', 'breakfast', 'get', 'older', 'fatter', 'clothes', 'become', 'more', 'expensive', 'elaborate', 'opulent', 'conditions', 'have', 'breakfast', 'are', 'more', 'more', 'opulent', 'more', 'more', 'nagging', 'shrill', 'know', 'time', 'strong', 'impression', 'grew', 'increasingly', 'bitchy', 'grew', 'increasingly', 'tired', 'Very', 'effective', 'story-telling', 'what', 'probably', 'only', 'two', 'were', 'enough', 'differences', 'Hearst', 'life', 'Kane', 'had', 'wanted', 'Welles', 'could', 'have', 'fallen', 'back', 'old', 'only', 'fiction', 'line', 'battle', 'Hearst', 'were', 'way', 'too', 'egotistical', 'allow', 'compromise', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wondering', 'who', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'have', 'won', 'battle', 'long', 'run.I', ""'m"", 'going', 'critics', 'who', 'have', 'said', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'bit', 'too', 'serious', 'demanding', 'audience', 'ever', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'popular']",N/A

Love""","[7, 9]","I don't want to malign the folks who wish that this were Star Wars, but geez, talk about wooden acting, boxy dialogue,  cornball plotting... I go off.  All apologies, Yodaheads!Anyway, case closed.  This remains the greatest film of the talking period, period.  The technical stuff is great, but the core of the film, as one reviewer noted, is character.  Character is the genesis of great fiction.  I ought to know.  I've taught creative writing for twenty years and published a chunk myself, some of it pretty acceptable.But there is more.  This film gets at, through Charles Foster Kane's excursions and incursions, the essence of American Imperialism, which appears more and more to be the essence of the American Character, the notion that ""I'm right and everyone else is wrong, or at least inferior.""  Entitlement both personal and international.  Does this not ring anyone's bell?  Kane had his pet war, created by a corrupt government in collusion with the media...and we now get...?  Somebody shout it out:  Fox.So if watching things blow up is your idea of entertainment, I'd recommend sticking with  games.  If you want to feel and think along with a movie that could have, should have, been made today, this is your ticket.Also, you get Orson Welles acting with the bravura of a champ, not to mention Joseph Cotton, who is sublime as the innocent turned cynic.  And all the technical stuff that everybody talks about.  Yep.  Great.  Still, for me, this is one of the two movies that best encapsulate the ""character"" we 'murkins have backed ourselves into by neglecting to confront the dark side of ourselves and the society we've created.  The other, obviously, is that great film by David Lynch, Blue Velvet.  Quite a different film, but the two works have similar resonances.Power, money, control, denial, rot, denial.  And then denial.I also invariably find Citizen Kane quite entertaining.  I've watched it about fifty times, and laughed and cried.  I wince at the slow decay, the destruction of everything that touches the man.  Yet the early sequences with the young Kane!  They're hilarious, full of self-absorbed adolescence gone amok and gone on way too long, as one might also characterize some critics of this masterpiece...and who might see themselves a little too clearly, hence the negativity...and denial.  Nobody has approached the level of craft AND emotion of this movie and with Hollywood being what it is, nobody ever will.  Hello, Mr. Welles.

The short version of the story is:Hearst was born a rich boy and became a SUPER rich boy w/ his newspaper empire in the early 1900s. Welles came to Hollywood from NYC after his famed WAR OF THE WORLDS radio broadcast in 1940. Welles was touted as a &quot;Genius&quot; by some papers and got &quot;the best studio deal in the history of Hollywood.&quot; Him getting all this attention and creative control and not having made 1 film pissed off a lot of people. After Welles tried to get his 1st 2 films made and they fell through he started making CITIZEN KANE based on the life of Hearst.It was leaked Welles was making the film and Hearst used his many papers to destroy the credability of Welles during the filming. His papers made up stories Welles was a Communist. This and Welles' own egomania (he believed the 'genius' title) &amp; bad temper drove his reputation into the ground. CITIZEN KANE opened to limited release due to Hearst. After Heasrt died in 1950 the film started showing up on critics &quot;10 best films&quot; lists, eventually becoming the legend it is today.

Orson Welles, then young and precocious, displayed style and intelligence in Citizen Kane that revolutionized filmmaking, and the film might be considered groundbreaking more for it's technical accomplishments than the movie itself.Welles directs himself as Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon whose life was often the biggest source of news around. &quot;Loved by millions, hated by just as many&quot; was his catchphrase. The movie follows his entire life, from childhood to death. It was loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, a real-life newspaper tycoon. I have seen Citizen Kane so many times, and it is starting to feel dates, especially in the dialogue. But the performances from Welles and his Mercury Theatre group and the visual elements more than make up for that. As the documentary and commentary teach us (more on that in a minute), Citizen Kane was more of a techical accomplishment. Welles used camera tricks, montage techniques, and difficult shots that were, at the time, never before seen on the screen. The attention to detail that went into every scene illustrates the passion that Welles brought to the screen. It has rarely been matched by any movie made since.For the 60th Anniversary, Warner has put together a terrific 2 DVD set. The obvious jewel in the crown is the 2 hours documentary titled &quot;The Battle over Citizen Kane&quot;, which not only tells the story of how the movie was made, but the lives of both Welles and Hearst. It is essential viewing to say the least. My second favorite extra is the Audio Commentary by film critic Roger Ebert. Love him or hate him, you can't deny his passion for movies and his almost encyclopedic knowledge of the subject. His commentary is full of fun facts and insight that made me look at Citizen Kane differently. The second commentary is by Peter Bogdanovich, a film scholar and Welles biographer. This one has it's moments, but it meanders at times. The Ebert one is the best. Rounding off the extras is an entertaining theatrical trailer and loads of storyboards, photos, and promos.Citizen Kane will always be regarded as a masterpiece, and rightly so. This DVD set from Warner is a must have, and with the quality of the extras, expect to be spending a lot of time with this DVD.

Erickson ""boycorrupted""","[2, 3]","i had this film as an assignment in a film noir class. i'd never seen it before and had read very little about it, knew nothing of the plot, or who bill hearst was, etc etc. if you'd asked me about ""rosebud,"" i'd have assumed it was an obscene reference (and according to roger ebert it is). i was essentially unbiased as to the content of the film.on first viewing i found it ""sentimental,"" yet effective for the really good (by any standards) performances of welles, cotton, et al. it's a ""life story,"" quite literally, from early childhood to death, of a larger-than-life figure; so it's bound to impress the viewer with the sheer scope of its subject and its inevitable tackling of monumental life issues, including the meaning of life itself in a way more direct, really, in its simplicity than has ever been achieved before or since in cinema. the ultimate sentiment implied by the word ""rosebud,"" the snow-globe, the sled itself, is that of childhood innocence lost. that winter day when his mother handed him over to the bank might have been the last of his life. there is the idea that the world and worldly life corrupt the soul, and that his mother, though she may have felt she was acting in his interest, had therefore sold his soul to the devil as it were that day and sealed his fate.there were a few points i missed the first time through, so i decided to watch it again with one of the commentaries - roger ebert's. this is certainly one of the better commentaries i've heard on dvd; all too often they degenerate into brainless pedantic ramblings that have nothing to do with anything, but ebert brings his knowledge of the making of the film, of welles himself, of the sundry ground-breaking techniques and effects used in the film - nearly every shot is a special effect - and of the many layers of meaning in the elements of the story, adding comprehensively to one's knowledge and appreciation of the film. plus he actually talks about the scenes that are on the screen as he's talking. how often can you say that. so i watched the whole thing again, and the vista widened.the next day i watched it again, this time with the peter brogdonovich commentary. this was just as informative as ebert's, and by the time it was over, i felt like i'd made the damn movie. i also felt like i never wanted to see it again, it having occupied something like 9.5 of the last 24 hours of my life. of course, i did watch parts of it again and again as i wrote my paper.by the way i got an ""a"". these director commentaries on dvds are great for film classes. (the teacher recommended we watch them, i wasn't ""cheating"" at all.) very comprehensive and facinating. oh - i watched that hearst documentary and the ""making of"" thing too, they also helped a great deal. i bought this dvd for this asignment, but i havent watched it since my paper, i admit - i did burn myself out on it. but it's still a powerful movie, unique in the history of cinema for the degree of nigh-omnipotence the hollywood ""powers that be"" allowed to be invested in one genius - the 26-year-old orson welles - to realize the project, and for the inevitable epoch-making backlash thereby incurred, which really did cripple welles' career permanently and probably set everybody back a few decades.a legendary film in every sense.  i can't believe another reviewer called it ""boring"" but hey, no accounting for tastes.  he probably thinks ""dude wheres my car"" is the paradigm.",5,an indisputably great film.,1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3451,"['i', 'had', 'film', 'assignment', 'film', 'noir', 'class', 'i', ""'d"", 'never', 'seen', 'had', 'read', 'very', 'little', 'knew', 'nothing', 'plot', 'who', 'bill', 'hearst', 'was', 'etc', 'etc', ""'d"", 'asked', 'rosebud', 'i', ""'d"", 'have', 'assumed', 'was', 'obscene', 'reference', 'according', 'roger', 'ebert', 'i', 'was', 'essentially', 'unbiased', 'content', 'film.on', 'first', 'viewing', 'i', 'found', 'sentimental', 'yet', 'effective', 'really', 'good', 'standards', 'performances', 'welles', 'cotton', 'al', 'life', 'story', 'quite', 'literally', 'early', 'childhood', 'death', 'larger-than-life', 'figure', 'bound', 'impress', 'viewer', 'sheer', 'scope', 'subject', 'inevitable', 'tackling', 'monumental', 'life', 'issues', 'including', 'meaning', 'life', 'way', 'more', 'direct', 'really', 'simplicity', 'ever', 'been', 'achieved', 'cinema', 'ultimate', 'sentiment', 'implied', 'word', 'rosebud', 'snow-globe', 'sled', 'childhood', 'innocence', 'lost', 'winter', 'day', 'when', 'mother', 'handed', 'bank', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'last', 'life', 'idea', 'world', 'worldly', 'life', 'corrupt', 'soul', 'mother', 'may', 'have', 'felt', 'was', 'acting', 'interest', 'had', 'therefore', 'sold', 'soul', 'devil', 'were', 'day', 'sealed', 'fate.there', 'were', 'few', 'points', 'i', 'missed', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'decided', 'watch', 'again', 'one', 'commentaries', 'roger', 'ebert', 'certainly', 'one', 'better', 'commentaries', 'i', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'dvd', 'too', 'often', 'degenerate', 'brainless', 'pedantic', 'ramblings', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'anything', 'ebert', 'knowledge', 'making', 'film', 'welles', 'sundry', 'ground-breaking', 'techniques', 'effects', 'used', 'film', 'nearly', 'shot', 'special', 'effect', 'many', 'layers', 'meaning', 'elements', 'story', 'adding', 'comprehensively', 'one', 'knowledge', 'appreciation', 'film', 'actually', 'scenes', 'are', 'screen', 'talking', 'how', 'often', 'can', 'say', 'so', 'i', 'watched', 'whole', 'thing', 'again', 'vista', 'widened.the', 'next', 'day', 'i', 'watched', 'again', 'time', 'peter', 'brogdonovich', 'commentary', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'informative', 'ebert', 'time', 'was', 'i', 'felt', 'i', ""'d"", 'made', 'damn', 'movie', 'i', 'also', 'felt', 'i', 'never', 'wanted', 'see', 'again', 'having', 'occupied', 'something', '9.5', 'last', '24', 'hours', 'life', 'course', 'i', 'did', 'watch', 'parts', 'again', 'again', 'i', 'wrote', 'paper.by', 'way', 'i', 'got', 'director', 'commentaries', 'dvds', 'are', 'great', 'film', 'classes', 'teacher', 'recommended', 'watch', 'i', 'was', ""n't"", 'cheating', 'very', 'comprehensive', 'facinating', 'i', 'watched', 'hearst', 'documentary', 'making', 'thing', 'too', 'also', 'helped', 'great', 'deal', 'i', 'bought', 'dvd', 'asignment', 'i', 'havent', 'watched', 'paper', 'i', 'admit', 'i', 'did', 'burn', 'out', 'still', 'powerful', 'movie', 'unique', 'history', 'cinema', 'degree', 'nigh-omnipotence', 'hollywood', 'powers', 'be', 'allowed', 'be', 'invested', 'one', 'genius', '26-year-old', 'orson', 'welles', 'realize', 'project', 'inevitable', 'epoch-making', 'backlash', 'thereby', 'incurred', 'really', 'did', 'cripple', 'welles', 'career', 'permanently', 'probably', 'set', 'everybody', 'back', 'few', 'decades.a', 'legendary', 'film', 'sense', 'i', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'reviewer', 'called', 'boring', 'hey', 'accounting', 'tastes', 'probably', 'dude', 'wheres', 'car', 'paradigm']",N/A

Its technological advancements are notable as the artistic talents of the director still us dazzle today. The choice of camera angles, the settings for the scenes, and the entire idea of a film-long treatment of a man's psychological makeup illustrates just how innovative and unique this classic is. The ""rosebud"" mystery holds our attention throughout. Outside of the film itself, the history of its production and release is nearly as interesting as what transpires on the screen. Frankly, I was surprised that Hearst did not sue Orson Welles for defamation, but then I read an article showcasing all the differences between the life of W. Randolph Hearst and those of Charles Foster Kane; so now I'm not sure what to think about the controversy. Anyway, it adds another level of allure to this masterpiece.Citizen Kane is a powerful film that deserves to be studied for another century or more. I  recommend it, but, in my opinion, it is not close to being the greatest film of all time. Although its worth is undeniable, I can only place it in my Top 30 list. It manages to be brilliant and overrated, which is as difficult and unprecedented a combination as there may be.

Clearly, hundreds of movies to follow were influenced by the new and daring strategies used by Wells; this special edition includes commentary from Hollywood insiders describing the exact extent of the impact the movie has made.  That being said, however, what was once groundbreaking has lost some of its mystique given that so many modern films have surpassed the techniques used here--should Memento be considered one of the best movies of all time too?  Yes, the story is engaging, the mystery intriguing, and the character of Charles Foster Kane compelling; combined with the filming methods, these characteristics truly make Citzen Kane a great movie.

By nature, any time something extremly subjective like a movie is ranked number one people are going to be divided.  Personally I don't think this is the best movie of all time, it's in the top five for sure but not the best.  That honor has to go to my all time favorite the Godfather but that story is for another review.The movie Citizen Kane is a radical departure for most people.  Raised in the short attention span theater, alot of people don't have the patience to sit through this movie.  But for those who do, and are in the mood to think a bit, this movie is great.  When you first see it, on the surface their isn't much their.  It's a good story but why all the hype.  Well the impact of Citizen Kane actually hits you when you turn off the movie.  You sleep on it, or you do something else and the next day you start to think about it.  You realize that this is damn good cinematography, not just for 1941 but for 2001.  Their is a ton of great shots in the movie from when he drops the snow globe to when he takes a picture of the reporters he stole away.  You then begin to think about Rosebud.  Sure everyone already knew what Rosebud was, but why is it so important to a man who seemingly has everything, and yet nothing at the same time?  You also begin to see that for all his success, his failures far out weigh them.  All this stuff starts seeping into your mind and you suddenly realize the impact of this movie.  His unraveling at his failed attempt to make an opera star out of his wife, his failed attempt at running for governor all make you think.So for those of you who &quot;get&quot; Citizen Kane, you already knew these things, but for those of you who have seen it and don't like it, watch it again and like the quote at the end of American Beauty tells you, &quot;look closer.&quot;",5,Citizen Kane is overrated,1002153600,"10 4, 2001",2001,1900,"['Well', 'being', 'considered', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time', 'territory', 'nature', 'time', 'something', 'extremly', 'subjective', 'movie', 'ranked', 'number', 'one', 'people', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'divided', 'Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'top', 'five', 'sure', 'not', 'best', 'honor', 'go', 'time', 'Godfather', 'story', 'review.The', 'movie', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'radical', 'departure', 'most', 'people', 'Raised', 'short', 'attention', 'span', 'theater', 'alot', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'patience', 'sit', 'movie', 'who', 'do', 'are', 'mood', 'think', 'bit', 'movie', 'great', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'surface', ""n't"", 'much', 'good', 'story', 'why', 'hype', 'Well', 'impact', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'actually', 'when', 'turn', 'off', 'movie', 'sleep', 'do', 'something', 'else', 'next', 'day', 'start', 'think', 'realize', 'damn', 'good', 'cinematography', 'not', 'just', '1941', '2001', 'ton', 'great', 'shots', 'movie', 'when', 'snow', 'globe', 'when', 'picture', 'reporters', 'stole', 'away', 'then', 'begin', 'think', 'Rosebud', 'Sure', 'everyone', 'already', 'knew', 'what', 'Rosebud', 'was', 'why', 'so', 'important', 'man', 'who', 'seemingly', 'everything', 'yet', 'nothing', 'same', 'time', 'also', 'begin', 'see', 'success', 'failures', 'far', 'out', 'weigh', 'stuff', 'seeping', 'mind', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'impact', 'movie', 'unraveling', 'failed', 'attempt', 'make', 'opera', 'star', 'wife', 'failed', 'attempt', 'running', 'governor', 'make', 'think.So', 'who', 'quot', 'get', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'already', 'knew', 'things', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'watch', 'again', 'quote', 'end', 'American', 'Beauty', 'tells', 'quot', 'closer.', 'quot']",N/A

Otherwise, a classic national prank that made the rest look like idiots.The Ambersons was butchered, so we'll never know what that was meant to be; but it still gets 4 stars by all the critics.Oddly, Citizen Cane was the breaking of Welles as a film maker. So hyped as time passed, he couldn't live up to the hype.  If the film was rationally viewed, he may have had less expected of him. The myth around this so-called masterpiece, made it much more difficult for him later on.

I know there are people who don't understand why this film is considered to be one of the most brilliantly made films ever produced, but I propose the reason for that is this: the film and narrative techniques on display in &quot;Kane&quot; have become so integral to every film made since that they no longer seem special in Orson Welles' film when looked at from a 21st Century perspective.  I encourage anyone still in doubt of this film's greatness to instead look at it from an historical perspective; just compare it to any other movie that also came out in 1941 and I think &quot;Kane&quot;'s uniqueness will be apparent.I don't think the film is without flaws.  Welles' pacing can be slow at times, and I think the last quarter of the movie especially drags.  The story itself isn't particularly interesting or even novel for its time, but one doesn't (or shouldn't) watch &quot;Kane&quot; for the originality of the story.  Instead, pay attention to how the story is told and who's telling it.  When the film is over, ask yourself this: can you say you've been given an objective account of Kane's story?  Do you really know what happened to him?This is radical stuff for 1941. Can you imagine a movie being released at that time that didn't answer the questions it raised?  The motivation that puts the entire world of the film in motion remains unresolved.  That doesn't happen very often in films even now, let alone then.And if none of this is reason enough to watch &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; just watch it for the stunning cinematography and compositions.  Virtually every frame is a work of art in itself.And if that isn't reason enough to watch it, then just watch it for Orson Welles' mesmerizing performance in the title role.

These types of movies, if well done, are timeless and this one certainly fits that bill. The next night, I watched the documentary on the second disc, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"". Wow!

It's debatable whether or not CITIZEN KANE is even Orson Welles' greatest film since TOUCH OF EVIL is regarded by many of the director's devotees as being better. Logically then, that would have to make TOUCH OF EVIL the greatest film ever made.Actually, no single film has a right to such a designation as being the greatest. Every movie is limited by its genre and the specific story it proposes to tell. Different films have different things to say and many diverse ways of saying them. One genre - be it drama, horror, comedy, musical, etc. - is not above another. There are outstanding films of every type. Having said that, CITIZEN KANE is definitely one of the greatest films of its genre and of all time, and the influence it had on motion pictures is undeniable. However, many of the techniques accredited to it as being ""firsts"" have been used in movies well before KANE. Devices like flashbacks, overlapping dialogue, visible ceilings - these things weren't introduced in KANE as it's often cited. The difference was that Welles put them all together in one film to create a cinematic synthesis, like a magician's bag of tricks opened up to dazzle and enthrall the spectator. This comes as no surprise given the fact that Welles himself liked to dabble in magic and the art of illusion. One implausibility in the script was overlooked: When Kane whispers ""Rosebud"" on his deathbed no one is around to hear him, so how does everyone in the film know it was the last thing he said? The fact that we're willing to dismiss or not even notice this rather major oversight is a tribute to how the film's magic spell affects us.Kept in proper perspective, CITIZEN KANE is still a powerful work, its vivid imagery lingers in our memory and its message - ""of what profit is it to a man if he gains the world but forfeits his soul?"" - remains as potent as ever.

297366,A3VIOCJZ22JZXT,6302135621,C. B Collins Jr.,"[3, 3]","Citizen Kane is certainly a unique film, a visual oddity of a film, with unique camera angles and surreal settings. The film just looks different from other films with its dark geometric interiors and camera shots that actually accentuate all the interior settings. It also is a unique story for it famously follows the life of William Randolph Hearst and is a commentary on that oversized powerhouse ego-maniac. The two female leads in the film, Ruth Warrick, playing first wife Emily Monroe Norton Kane, and Dorothy Comingore, playing second wife, Susan Alexander Kane, were extremely strong performances that were as different from each other as night and day. For Kane is one of those people who do not think the normal consequences of life apply to him. When he runs for public office while attacking his political opponent, he never seems to realize that the fact that he has a mistress will come to light and destroy his marriage and his political career. Kane relentlessly attacks career politician James Gettys, played by Ray Collins. But Gettys is a seasoned street fighter. He gets the goods on Kane and then carefully confronts him in a set up situation where both women are involved. Emily Kane shows tremendous grace in the face of defeat and humiliation. But then a life of hell starts for Susan Alexander Kane for she becomes the project of her husband who pushes her to sing and become an opera star. Susan Kane's speaking voice can peel paint off walls, a penetrating and grating high volume whine. When she and Charles Kane escape to his castle, the film becomes surreal, something out of Camus or Sartre, where people become each other's hell. Susan Kane's fall into alcoholism is tragic and yet totally expected.

However, the propaganda machine which is the AFI 100 Greatest American Movies has created a maelstrom around this film which will never end - much like the maelstrom the movie created during its production. Ironic.The operative word in the AFI list is &quot;American&quot;, and you also have to ask yourself who are and what is the criteria of the AFI Board that made this list. The fact the the AFI list excludes any and all foreign films (except some of David Lean's work which shouldn't be considered an American film anyway) AUTOMATICALLY handicaps it, if not making it an out right mockery of the concept of a &quot;Greatest Films&quot; list. No films by Fellini, Truffaut, Kiewslowski, Kurosawa, Godard, early Hitchcock, Tarkovsky, Fassbinder, Herzog, Bergman! Come on now, those are the filmmakers who helped take film from a maudlin form mass entertainment to a true art form. If one was to examine subsequent lists presented by AFI, you'll understand how hackneyed and meaningless their 100 Greatest American Film List. It's all subjective anyway - filmmakers, particularly, will rate Citizen Kane higher than the typical movie-goer of today for several reasons discussed in other reviews of the film. Kane will have it's place because its a much-talked about film.With that being said, the film and the DVD version are great. Period. Greatest of All Time, under what criteria. Don't bash the film because it's not to your taste - some might argue that Michaelego's Sistine Chapel is the greatest work of art of all time, others might say any number of works by Picasso or perhaps Mozart's symphonies. To recognize quality is what counts. To dismiss Kane as slow, boring and stupid (which it is CLEARLY not) shows that the viewer/reviewer is lacking in artistic experience. Would one condemn the early Renaissance works of Giotto because they don't do full justice to the human form the way Carravagio does?The movie is great because consessieurs of the craft recognize that it is great.

Often cited as one of the greatest films in movie history, and one that I saw for the first time only about three years ago. Does it live up to the hype?God, yes.Much is made, and rightly so, about the technical inovations in this movie. There are many and they are notable. The use of zooms before zoom lenses, the use of deep-focus, the appearance of ceilings, Greg Tolland's wonderful cinematography, etc, etc, ad naseum.What really made this movie great for me are the performances and the story. Consider: Welles, who was young when this movie was made, convincingly manages to portray Kane at all the major stages of his life. Part of this was the makeup, but only part. Most of it was due to his incredible and forceful acting ability. Supporting performances by the likes of Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead (in the days before ""Bewitched""), round out a superb cast.Beyond that there's the screenplay. Sharp, biting and well-written with a good ear for dialogue (not surprising, given Welles' background in radio). At time the story is laugh-out-loud funny, and at other times filled with great pathos. Yeah, there's flaws (starting with the fact that no one appeared to be in the room to hear Kane's last word), but who cares? Mostly what it is, is amazing cinema.Yes, the iconic images help. When I watched this movie the first time, it was like I was seeing it again. I'd seen so many referrences to the film, particularly in ""The Simpsons"" that it all gave me an odd sense of deja vu. This is not a bad thing.The DVD presentation is great! Wonderful, insightful commentaries and ""The Battle Over 'Citizen Kane'"" (which is worth the DVD price in of itself), round out an excellent DVD.A word to people who haven't seen the film before, or who have but weren't duly impressed: When I watched this movie the first time, I could sense the greatness. I could tell it was an amazing film, but I couldn't quite figure out why. Then I played it with Roger Ebert's commentary track, and it all became clear.

297374,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,6302135621,Christopher Culver,"[5, 6]","At the opening of Orson Welles' 1941 film CITIZEN KANE, a dying old man drops a snowglobe as he whispers his last word ""Rosebud"". Some two hours later we learn that this puzzling utterance was the name of his beloved childhood sleigh. If this mystery was all there was to the film, I would be angry at the number of cartoons that have spoiled it. Luckily, however, ""Rosebud"" merely sets up the skeleton of the film. When a reporter goes to interview those who knew the deceased, the real drama of the story turns out to be the rise and fall of newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (played by Orson Welles himself).Based on William Randolph Hearst, Kane is an inheritor to a great fortune, yet he chooses to work at a minor newspaper, turning it into the leading daily of New York City through abhorrent yellow press methods. Being able to create the news itself in determining what goes on the front page only feeds the fires of his megalomania. Driven to believe in his own greatness--while he simultaneously craves the love of those around him to validate himself--Kane goes from a popular man of the people to an eccentric recluse with two failed marriages and no friends left. As he sits in his vast estate, surrounded by an art collection he never even unwrapped, Welles convincingly relays the moral that possessions don't buy happiness.I initially found the film difficult to appreciate in some aspects of production. The transitions between scenes are primitive, and the make-up used when Welles and a couple of others play old men is not convincing. However, the quality of the screenplay is more than sufficient to make up for the limitations of early 1940's film-making. The acting is superb as well. Though I find Welles more gripping as the younger and sociable Kane than the old recluse, many of the other actors play their roles with perfect naturalness. Surprisingly, many of these actors had never appeared on film before, which makes their achievement all the more impressive.Evidentally no pristine transfer of the film exists. That's a real shame, but nonetheless the film is enjoyable even in its shoddy video quality. Writing reviews like this is somewhat unnecessary--CITIZEN KANE is such a legendary film that if you enjoy cinema you'll seek it out regardless of what I say.",5,"Lives up to the hype, a fantastic film, though surprisingly a little different than how pop culture references it",1202169600,"02 5, 2008",2008,2299,"['opening', 'Orson', 'Welles', '1941', 'film', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'dying', 'old', 'man', 'snowglobe', 'last', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'two', 'hours', 'later', 'learn', 'puzzling', 'utterance', 'was', 'name', 'beloved', 'childhood', 'sleigh', 'mystery', 'was', 'there', 'was', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'angry', 'number', 'cartoons', 'have', 'spoiled', 'Luckily', 'however', 'Rosebud', 'merely', 'up', 'skeleton', 'film', 'When', 'reporter', 'interview', 'who', 'knew', 'deceased', 'real', 'drama', 'story', 'out', 'be', 'rise', 'fall', 'newspaper', 'magnate', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'played', 'Orson', 'Welles', '.Based', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'Kane', 'inheritor', 'great', 'fortune', 'yet', 'work', 'minor', 'newspaper', 'turning', 'leading', 'daily', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'abhorrent', 'yellow', 'press', 'methods', 'Being', 'able', 'create', 'news', 'determining', 'what', 'front', 'page', 'only', 'fires', 'megalomania', 'Driven', 'believe', 'own', 'greatness', 'simultaneously', 'love', 'validate', 'Kane', 'popular', 'man', 'people', 'eccentric', 'recluse', 'two', 'failed', 'marriages', 'friends', 'left', 'vast', 'estate', 'surrounded', 'art', 'collection', 'never', 'even', 'unwrapped', 'Welles', 'convincingly', 'moral', 'possessions', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness.I', 'initially', 'found', 'film', 'difficult', 'appreciate', 'aspects', 'production', 'transitions', 'scenes', 'are', 'primitive', 'make-up', 'used', 'when', 'Welles', 'couple', 'others', 'play', 'old', 'men', 'not', 'convincing', 'However', 'quality', 'screenplay', 'more', 'sufficient', 'make', 'up', 'limitations', 'early', '1940', 'film-making', 'acting', 'superb', 'as', 'well', 'find', 'Welles', 'more', 'gripping', 'younger', 'sociable', 'Kane', 'old', 'recluse', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'play', 'roles', 'perfect', 'naturalness', 'Surprisingly', 'many', 'actors', 'had', 'never', 'appeared', 'film', 'achievement', 'more', 'impressive.Evidentally', 'pristine', 'transfer', 'film', 'real', 'shame', 'nonetheless', 'film', 'enjoyable', 'even', 'shoddy', 'video', 'quality', 'Writing', 'reviews', 'somewhat', 'unnecessary', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'such', 'legendary', 'film', 'enjoy', 'cinema', ""'ll"", 'seek', 'out', 'regardless', 'what', 'say']",N/A

Well how well that arguement holds up is up to each individual viewer. What is undeniable is that it was decades ahead of it's time in it's ability to tell something at the time so original and flawless.Orson Welles plays as Charles Foster Kane, and we see him from a little boy till he becomes an old cranky man. It's told brilliantly from the perspective of a reporter who's investigating the meaning of Kane's apparent last word, ""Rosebud"". The way this movie shifts is so non-linear that it required viewers to put pieces together like a jigsaw puzzle, but it surprisingly is never confusing in how it does it. Kane as a boy is adopted by a wealthy man, as a young man buys a news paper that he makes a mokery of, marries a President's niece, runs for office buy get's set back by a singer who can't really sing, gets obsessed by material possessions, and I still haven't begung to describe the complex life it unveils. The cast of characters do a magnificent job at surrounding him at different points in his life, along with being inteview subjects after Kane's death, but Kane is always in the forefront and his presense on screen is never topped.This film is fascinating, entertaining, and mezmorizing at every single point. After watching it many times I still don't remember where everything begins and ends, but can easily comprehend Kane's life in luxery.

297376,A2NX99GVAX4TRP,6302135621,"Christopher J. Jarmick ""Word  Lover""","[13, 14]","There are some who do not believe that Citizen Kane is the greatest film ever made.  Some people understand that the film has some remarkable technical innovations, yet still find the film less than compelling.  I can't really explain this reaction to the film, but it exists.  Perhaps if we understood why someone doesn't like Citizen Kane we would also unravel other great film mysteries such as  who would pay full price to see Tom Greene in something like Freddy Got Fingered and who can't wait to see Bio Dome 2.Not everyone is going to agree it is the greatest film ever made or the most entertaining and once you start calling anything The Greatest of them all a bit of skeptism is likely to rear its head.  One thing is certain, most will appreciate Greg Toland's beautiful use of light and shadow and photographic genius.  And the more you know about how innovative some of the shots were and what lengths it took to accomplish them, you'll appreciate the effort even more.The life of the fictional Charles Foster Kane is examined in detail.  It all starts with a quest to find out the significance of the last word kane uttered as he died -- Rosebud.  And all of the film techniques used in the film still seem fresh, the symbolism all works perfectly. In fact the film is constructed not unlike some massive reality television specials that might be called... The Unauthorized Biography of Charles Foster Kane. Of course it would be those reality television specials that are poorly mimicking some of the ideas and structures of Citizen Kane and not the other way around.  In other words we're talking about a film that can enjoyed as entertainment, not something that one only appreciates without feeling an affection or warmth toward it.  You can praise the film until you are sick of praising it and still find something in the film, a shot, a camera angle, a dissolve,  an actor's look, a line of dialogue, that will take your breath away.Except for the barest hint of edge enhancement this is the cleanest, crispest and most beautiful black and white film you've ever seen on DVD.  And it doesn't look overly processed or mechanical.  In fact there are some dark scenes where for the first time I was able to see some details I've never seen before.The audio is Dolby Digital 1.0.  Rather than artificially enhance and try to remix the soundtrack it was merely cleaned up and presented as clean and crisp as possible.  It might have been nice to have heard a stereo version of Bernard Herrman's magnificent score, but it would seem utterly un-natural to long time fans of the film to have an artificially enhanced stereo surround soundtrack (and the elements probably don't exist to do it anyway).There's a lot of extras on the DVD's from newsreel clips to secret Easter Eggs to find and enjoy.There is a generous selection of stills which are automated but can be paused if desired. One of the still galleries contains additional commentary from Roger Ebert.THE POST PRODUCTION section has four subsections including Deleted Scenes which offers photos, sketches and storyboards that show scenes which did not make the final cut of the film or were abandoned even before they were shot.If you highlight the sled on the features menu you will see the 5 minute interview with Ruth Warrick who played Emily Norton Kane. She talks about working with Welles and how the film was shot under strict security so no one would know exactly what was being shot or how it was all going to be put together when it was finished.Click on the sled on the last page of the second section of the production notes for a brief 3 minute interview with director Robert Wise. Wise was the editor on Citizen Kane and he tells the story about meeting Welles for the first and one of the first screenings of the film for very nervous executives and lawyers.On Disc 2  you will find the full length documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane which was originally aired on P.B.S.'s American Experience Program.It tells the backgrounds of both William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.  How their paths crossed, how the two men clashed and how Hearst became obsessed with stopping Kane and destroying Welles' career.  Kane bombed at the box-office but was then nominated for 9 Oscars, however it won only one and afterwards RKO withdrew the film from the market and put it in it's vault for several years.  Hearst's campaign to ruin the film and Welles was pretty effective but he also hurt his own career and reputation in the process.The first of two feature length commentary tracks is from director Peter Bogdanovich.  Bogdanovich's comments range from discussing the film's technical achievements and analyzing the storyline to recounting conversations he had with Welles about the film.  We learn Kane is not his favorite Welles film.Roger Ebert's feature length commentary is even more interesting, informative.If you are not quite sure why the film is so highly regarded this commentary will clear it up for you. Ebert spends a lot of time talking about the innovative cinematography (deep focus photography), editing, the special optical effects used to create the imagery in the film and the lighting.  He goes into some detail about the symbolism used throughout the film and how the film was actually very low budget.Citizen Kane is a masterpiece and this DVD celebrates that by showing off the film at it's very best.  The extra's allow those who have not read several books, or seen documentaries about the film or Hearst and Welles to 'catch-up' with critics and film-buffs.Christopher Jarmick,is the author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F.

It's mostly lame with hints of promise and then the whole thing just peters out.If you haven't seen this turkey yet, go rent ""I Love Trouble,"" which has the always sparkling Julia Roberts and the no-less sparkling Nick Nolte as a newspaper man (Nolte) and a newspaper woman (Roberts) who fall in love.Nick Nolte has done some fine work is ""48 Hours,"" ""3 Fugitives"" and others in his numbered series (I believe he is also on the wonderful show ""2 1/2 Men,"" playing one of the full men, not the 1/2 man).  Julia Roberts is always a treat, and you may know her from ""Pretty Women"" or ""Hook.""  The two perform beautifully as they tell jokes to each other, write for newspapers, and fall in love in the process.  Is it their cantankerous relationship that draws them together, or the dizzying smell of newsprint, or both?  It really doesn't matter because this puppy is a real cinematic treat.""Citizen Kane,"" by contrast is the weaker of the two films as it follows Orson Welles playing a man named Citizen Kane (hello, unbelievable character name, anyone?) who writes for newspapers and likes snowglobes, showgirls, rosebuds, and getting older and wider.  That's about it in a nutshell.  I know this movie is supposed to be really old, so it is a ""classic,"" but it doesn't even make any sense.  It's also kind of like ""Newsies"" without the music.They might consider remaking this film and might I suggest Bernie Mac as an Internet newspaper man who besides trying to jazz up his daily blog has to care for two foster kids and maybe a dog.  The Hollywood writers can probably come up with some more details to flesh it out--I'm just spitballing here--but I think with a little finesse and maybe a cameo reuniting him with Ashton Kutcher, this could be a very decent film.Anyway, if you haven't seen the original film, you should save your money and go out and buy a Walkman or an exotic fruit of some sort.

297379,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,6302135621,"Cloud ""...""","[1, 3]","This was the film that almost never was. Orson Welles, an accomplished radio personality was given a really extraordinary deal by RKO Studios. Basically he had complete control over his projects, final say on the final cut, whatever actors he wanted and could write, star and direct this film. However, it was too closely related to the life of a newspaper tycoon that he wanted it destroyed. And how's this for irony: the ""greatest film ever made"" was actually booed whenever one of it's 9 Oscar nominations were announced on stage.The movie starts out famously with Charles Foster Kane, an old man clutching a snow globe and muttering ""Rosebud"" before dying. A news reporter wants to find out what was so special about this word, could mean anything, could mean nothing. So we find a man named Thompson visiting people who knew Kane and see if he can unravel the mystery.While it may not look like since it's been near 60 years since the film came out, there was a lot of new camera techniques and lighting on the film. One it introduced was deep focus photography, where everything in front of the camera and everything way in the background were in focus, which was new since it was usually one's clear, one isn't.Also with the help of deep focus, certain scenes suggest something without saying it. There's a shot where Kane is signing away control to his fortune so he doesn't by everything in sight and in the room behind is what looks like a standard sized room with a standard sized mirror. However he walks closer to the mirror and you find out it's a big damn mirror with the top of it being close to 20 feet above his head. Another scene is in regards to a massive fireplace same concept.There's the infamous political rally where he just basically had a painting, punched some holes and moved lights around to simulate movement. When Kane meets his 2nd wife his face is fully lit, but when things start to go little sour, he's backlit(meaning his face is in shadow). There's many more of these(for example in the opening scene there's one window that is always in the same place every single frame despite we're getting closer to the mansion.All this talk of the technological feats and not a word about the film itself. To be honest, it's a good film. It's not ""holy $%#@ that's the best film eva!"" but it's not horrible. You watch it and it's not a moving film, it's just really well done.Also, check out the Ebert commentary. Say what you want about his tastes but he does know film. He's like an encyclopedia almost bringing details that you'd think ""why would he know that? and how?"" He also gets into the technical shots and how they were done which is quite different for a critic.Anyway you look at it, it is a quite well-made film, it's just it may not be everyone's cup of tea but there's a lot of people who seem to like this cup.P.S: The tycoon is William Randolph Hearst and for proof that this may be based on his life: Hearst's mistress, actress Marion Davies, had a nickname for her umm, sexual body part between her legs....""rosebud"".",5,To me not the greatest ever but is a milestone,1111363200,"03 21, 2005",2005,3064,"['was', 'film', 'almost', 'never', 'was', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'accomplished', 'radio', 'personality', 'was', 'given', 'really', 'extraordinary', 'deal', 'RKO', 'Studios', 'Basically', 'had', 'complete', 'control', 'projects', 'final', 'say', 'final', 'cut', 'actors', 'wanted', 'could', 'write', 'star', 'direct', 'film', 'However', 'was', 'too', 'closely', 'related', 'life', 'newspaper', 'tycoon', 'wanted', 'destroyed', 'how', 'irony', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'actually', 'booed', 'whenever', 'one', '9', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'were', 'announced', 'stage.The', 'movie', 'out', 'famously', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'old', 'man', 'clutching', 'snow', 'globe', 'muttering', 'Rosebud', 'dying', 'news', 'reporter', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'so', 'special', 'word', 'could', 'mean', 'anything', 'could', 'mean', 'nothing', 'find', 'man', 'named', 'Thompson', 'visiting', 'people', 'who', 'knew', 'Kane', 'see', 'can', 'unravel', 'mystery.While', 'may', 'not', 'look', 'been', '60', 'years', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'lot', 'new', 'camera', 'techniques', 'lighting', 'film', 'One', 'introduced', 'was', 'deep', 'focus', 'photography', 'where', 'everything', 'front', 'camera', 'everything', 'way', 'background', 'were', 'focus', 'was', 'new', 'was', 'usually', 'one', 'clear', 'one', ""isn't.Also"", 'help', 'deep', 'focus', 'certain', 'scenes', 'suggest', 'something', 'saying', 'shot', 'where', 'Kane', 'signing', 'away', 'control', 'fortune', 'so', ""n't"", 'everything', 'sight', 'room', 'behind', 'what', 'standard', 'sized', 'room', 'standard', 'sized', 'mirror', 'However', 'closer', 'mirror', 'find', 'big', 'damn', 'mirror', 'top', 'being', 'close', '20', 'feet', 'head', 'scene', 'regards', 'massive', 'fireplace', 'same', 'concept.There', 'infamous', 'political', 'rally', 'where', 'just', 'basically', 'had', 'painting', 'punched', 'holes', 'moved', 'lights', 'simulate', 'movement', 'When', 'Kane', '2nd', 'wife', 'face', 'fully', 'lit', 'when', 'things', 'start', 'go', 'little', 'sour', 'backlit', 'meaning', 'face', 'shadow', 'many', 'more', 'example', 'opening', 'scene', 'one', 'window', 'always', 'same', 'place', 'single', 'frame', ""'re"", 'getting', 'closer', 'mansion.All', 'talk', 'technological', 'feats', 'not', 'word', 'film', 'be', 'honest', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'holy', '%', 'best', 'film', 'eva', 'not', 'horrible', 'watch', 'not', 'moving', 'film', 'just', 'really', 'well', 'done.Also', 'check', 'out', 'Ebert', 'commentary', 'Say', 'what', 'want', 'tastes', 'know', 'film', 'encyclopedia', 'almost', 'bringing', 'details', ""'d"", 'think', 'why', 'would', 'know', 'how', 'also', 'technical', 'shots', 'how', 'were', 'done', 'quite', 'different', 'critic.Anyway', 'look', 'quite', 'well-made', 'film', 'just', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea', 'lot', 'people', 'who', 'seem', 'like', 'cup.P.S', 'tycoon', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'proof', 'may', 'be', 'based', 'life', 'Hearst', 'mistress', 'actress', 'Marion', 'Davies', 'had', 'nickname', 'umm', 'sexual', 'body', 'part', 'legs', 'rosebud']",N/A

297382,A51IK68MWKV5R,6302135621,"Craig Clarke ""Somebody Dies""","[3, 3]","A lot of new film viewers don't seem to get what is so great about Kane. It's a slow film and the ""revelation"" at the end, in retrospect, doesn't seem very revelatory, but that's not the point. The point is that it's a great story, and after 60 years, it still stands up to repeated viewings.Influence is admittedly a difficult thing to measure, but after your third or fourth viewing of Citizen Kane, it becomes very obvious that it was way ahead of its time. Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland did things that you weren't supposed to be able to do then (e.g., deep focus, using ceilings) and made them work. Kane is really stunning visually, what with all the crosscuts, dissolves, and unusual edits, and I defy anyone to come up with a film from that period that is more of a visual feast.The screenplay, whether it was written by Herman Mankiewicz solo with Welles' input, or as a collaborative effort (I don't really care), is just as much a feat. Telling the story by letting each character tell their own sides, regardless of linearity (even overlapping at some points) was not something that was particularly encouraged. Even now, people say they can't quite keep up with what is going on, and although that may turn some people off, I don't think that Citizen Kane was necessarily meant for a mass audience. After all, Orson Welles, as a genius (and you know how they are), was always more interested in expressing his artistic vision than being concerned about how the public would respond.Bravery certainly comes in to play here, and courage and determination. Citizen Kane is the film that would not die. For the uninitiated, the story was (not very) loosely based on the life of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst (in fact, I did a college thesis comparing and contrasting the film to Hearst's life, but that's a whole other story). The film was so close to reality that Hearst wanted to buy the negative so he could burn it. It was almost never released. And then, once it was released, the public shunned it. It wasn't until the rights ran out and television picked it up from the public domain for broadcast that people finally were able to appreciate the film for what it was. It is almost that the film itself yearned to be seen.I could go into the performances and other such things, but that would make this really long and I am of the belief that reviews should be relatively short in order to keep the readers' attention. So, I will conclude by noting that Kane's influence even runs to modern music. The White Stripes' album White Blood Cells contains a song called ""The Union Forever"" where composer Jack White has lifted dialogue and lyrics from Kane and turned them into a bluesy rock song, thus spreading the word of Kane to future generations.Combine that with the fact that it continually top the list of greatest films ever and what you have is a phenomenon of immense proportions that shows no signs of stopping. As long as people continue to watch Citizen Kane, people will continue to appreciate it for the work of art that it is.",5,Requires multiple viewings,1054771200,"06 5, 2003",2003,3075,"['lot', 'new', 'film', 'viewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'what', 'so', 'great', 'Kane', 'slow', 'film', 'revelation', 'end', 'retrospect', ""n't"", 'seem', 'very', 'revelatory', 'not', 'point', 'point', 'great', 'story', '60', 'years', 'still', 'up', 'repeated', 'viewings.Influence', 'admittedly', 'difficult', 'thing', 'measure', 'third', 'fourth', 'viewing', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'very', 'obvious', 'was', 'way', 'ahead', 'time', 'Welles', 'cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'did', 'things', 'were', ""n't"", 'supposed', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'then', 'e.g.', 'deep', 'focus', 'using', 'ceilings', 'made', 'work', 'Kane', 'really', 'stunning', 'visually', 'what', 'crosscuts', 'dissolves', 'unusual', 'edits', 'defy', 'anyone', 'come', 'up', 'film', 'period', 'more', 'visual', 'feast.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'written', 'Herman', 'Mankiewicz', 'solo', 'Welles', 'input', 'collaborative', 'effort', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'feat', 'Telling', 'story', 'letting', 'character', 'tell', 'own', 'sides', 'regardless', 'linearity', 'even', 'overlapping', 'points', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'was', 'particularly', 'encouraged', 'Even', 'now', 'people', 'say', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'keep', 'up', 'what', 'going', 'may', 'turn', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'necessarily', 'meant', 'mass', 'audience', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'genius', 'know', 'how', 'are', 'was', 'always', 'more', 'interested', 'expressing', 'artistic', 'vision', 'being', 'concerned', 'how', 'public', 'would', 'respond.Bravery', 'certainly', 'play', 'here', 'courage', 'determination', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'film', 'would', 'not', 'die', 'uninitiated', 'story', 'was', 'not', 'very', 'loosely', 'based', 'life', 'newspaper', 'magnate', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'fact', 'did', 'college', 'thesis', 'comparing', 'contrasting', 'film', 'Hearst', 'life', 'whole', 'other', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'close', 'reality', 'Hearst', 'wanted', 'buy', 'negative', 'could', 'burn', 'was', 'almost', 'never', 'released', 'then', 'was', 'released', 'public', 'shunned', 'was', ""n't"", 'rights', 'ran', 'out', 'television', 'picked', 'up', 'public', 'domain', 'broadcast', 'people', 'finally', 'were', 'able', 'appreciate', 'film', 'what', 'was', 'almost', 'film', 'yearned', 'be', 'seen.I', 'could', 'go', 'performances', 'other', 'such', 'things', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'long', 'am', 'belief', 'should', 'be', 'relatively', 'short', 'order', 'keep', 'readers', 'attention', 'So', 'will', 'conclude', 'noting', 'Kane', 'influence', 'even', 'modern', 'music', 'White', 'Stripes', 'album', 'White', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'song', 'called', 'Union', 'Forever', 'where', 'composer', 'Jack', 'White', 'lifted', 'dialogue', 'lyrics', 'Kane', 'turned', 'bluesy', 'rock', 'song', 'thus', 'spreading', 'word', 'Kane', 'future', 'generations.Combine', 'fact', 'continually', 'top', 'list', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'what', 'have', 'phenomenon', 'immense', 'proportions', 'signs', 'stopping', 'As', 'long', 'people', 'continue', 'watch', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'people', 'will', 'continue', 'appreciate', 'work', 'art']",N/A
297383,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,6302135621,Craig MACKINNON,"[3, 4]","The titular Kane is a newspaper baron that starts off young, impetuous, and championing the common man.  As he ages, he becomes less and less attuned to the common man, withdrawing to a gigantic manor named Xanadu, where he dies with only his servants and utters his final word: ""Rosebud.""  The movie starts at Kane's death, and the making of a newsreel of his life.  A reporter sets off to discover the ""secret"" of the man, and to try to find the meaning of his final word.  Thus, the film is set up as a series of flashbacks as old friends and associates reminisce to the reporter about Kane.Such a dry interpretation of the plot does not do justice to the magic, the humour, and the intricacies of the film.  It is superbly crafted and the performances are top-notch.  The screenplay is witty and the film is watchable over and over because the non-linear nature of the plot keeps you guessing about what will come up next (a credit to editor Robert Wise).This DVD edition is clean and crisp.  The video is fantastic (perhaps too good - the newsreel, famously dragged around the parking lot by Wise to make it look more realistic, is perhaps too clean).  The sound is okay (but not great).  There are numerous special features.  Some are not very useful, such as layouts of storyboards that are too small (on my system) to see.  Two extras stand out.  The first is the 2-hour documentary on Wells, the movie, and William Randolf Hearst, the alleged basis for the character of Kane.  Instead of focussing on the film and the similarities and differences between Hearst and Kane, it actually compares the lives and careers of Hearst and Wells, only relating to the film character when there is an obvious overlap (e.g., the relationship between Kane/Hearst and their respective mistress-starlets).  The second great extra is the audio commentary by Roger Ebert.  He gives an inside view (culled from books, documentaries, and his own observations) of all aspects of the film, including shot composition, special effects, the actors and crew, etc.  It's a fascinating accompaniment (much better than the trite and dull second commentary by Peter Bogdanovich).Therefore, this DVD is well worth the price for any fan of Citizen Kane.

297384,AUHG8KSHI529U,6302135621,Craig Matteson,"[3, 4]","Citizen Kane is one of the most analyzed and written about films in all the history of movies.  You certainly don't need any commentary from me about the artistic merits of the film.  However, I will say that I find the movie visually stunning with a visual style that has been copied by many and almost always to lesser effect.  Some of the images stay in my memory like a beautiful melody.The script is also very good and at times it is powerful.  And while it is always listed as one of the greatest of all movies, and maybe as a movie it is, I certainly don't think it is the most powerful or moving film ever made.  It certainly is a great film, but can't you think of others that move you more deeply that were also well made films?But to think that Welles was only 25 years old when he made this film is absolutely breathtaking.  In making this film, Welles at once triumphs as a producer, director, and actor.  I can't even think of a similar achievement to compare it with.  Wagner at Bayreuth?This disk is a very beautiful transfer of the film (there are a few small defects), plus interesting commentaries by Roger Ebert, and Peter Bogdanovich, plus the trailer, newsreel from the premier, storyboards, and a second disk with a two-hour documentary on the battle Welles had with Hearst over the making and release of the film.  Isn't it interesting that the film has become more famous than Hearst?  Such a thing was unimaginable in 1941.But don't buy into the myth that this is a crypto biography of Hearst.  There is also McCormick and others (McCormick is the one who built the opera house for his mistress).  Certainly, aspects of Hearst's excesses are obvious, but one of the powers of fiction in the hands of an artist is to mix multiple realities together to get at something deeper and more instructive.  Ebert points out that the famous scene in which Kane destroys his mistress's room was based on a scene where Welles himself lost his temper in a restaurant.  True artists spare themselves least of all.This is a great set of disks that do justice to this great film.  I am glad that I own it.

The 26-year old whiz kid decided to take on another big name, newspaperman William Randolf Hearst. His first film, Citizen Kane, would be a satire on Hearst's life. Not only would Welles star in the film, but he would also direct and co-write it. Although the film was almost destroyed forever, it can still rightly be called the one of the greatest movies ever made!The film opens by the deathbed of newspaper mogul Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) just in time to hear his dying word: ""Rosebud"". What is Rosebud? That's the question reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) wants answered by any means necessary. Thompson sets out to investigate first-hand accounts of Kane and interview the people who knew him best. Told through flashbacks, Kane's life unfolds from his childhood, his rise to wealth and power in the mass media, his scandalous political career, two disastrous marriages, and his eventual fall. From these events, Thompson tries to piece together Kane's life and solve the mystery of what Rosebud truly is...With the making of this film, Hearst was outraged. Hearst and Welles were on a collision course and their two enormous egos clashed. Hearst banned any mention of the film in his media empire and vowed to have the film destroyed and Welles' future career ruined. Fortunately, the latter two did not happen exactly as planned (although neither of them were quite the same afterward), and Citizen Kane survived to be the great film we all know today.The film is innovative in its use of light and shadow, its non-linear style of storytelling, and Welles' incredible make-up job. He looks totally believable as Charles Foster Kane in all the stages of his adult life. All the shots were meticulously planned and nothing at all was wasted.The two-disc set of Citizen Kane not only contains the classic film, but also two full-length audio commentaries, storyboards and newsreels, and a two hour documentary called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" produced by the PBS series, The American Experience.

297387,A315K47GRB024C,6302135621,Daniel C. Markel,"[1, 2]","This review is for the Two-Disc Special Edition released in 2001 by Warner Brothers.Of course to many, this is considered to be the greatest movie ever made.  I personally think Casablanca, the first two Godfather epics, and Chinatown are better, and possibly several others, but still, Citizen Kane is undoubtedly one of the great masterpieces of Hollywood.  The movie generated a lot of controversy and mystique in its day with the alleged conflict it created with newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst.  The film was also a groundbreaking movie technically with the great depth of field shots and upward camera angles showing rarely seen ceilings.The story line is about the life of the world's richest man.  First, we find a young Kane who falls backward into a fortune, one that he initially wishes to have no part of, but is cajoled by his parents and his financial trustee to grab this opportunity of a lifetime.  When Kane is finally old enough to have full control of his vast wealth, he elects to become involved in the newspaper business.  His reasoning is that he believes he has a moral obligation to report the truth and protect and help the people who can not help themselves.  Kane even goes as far as publishing a ""Declaration of Principals"".  Of course from that point on, we view a man gradually corrupting himself until he's finally a completely broken man.  There are many moral lessons found in this movie which is another reason why it's such a great classic.There are countless memorable scenes in this film and many great quotes.  The greatest line of course is the last dying word of Kane and that is the word, ""Rosebud"".  From that point on,  the movie revolves finding the meaning behind that mysterious word.  Some of the other great quotes include, ""If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man.""  Another of one of my all time favorites is, ""You're right Mr. Thatcher.  I did lose one million dollars last year.  I expect to lose one million dollars this year.  I expect to lose one million dollar next year.  You know Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of one million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place -- in 60 years.""Since the movie is so convoluted with flashbacks, plus it contains strange camera angles, visually captivating scenes and brilliant dialogue, it's nearly impossible to appreciate with just one or even two viewings.  That is why I would strongly recommend buying the 2 DVD Special Edition package.  This is actually the third time I've seen this movie.  The first time was in the mid-80's on the big screen in an art theater.  The second time was on VHS cassette.  In both cases, as I recall, the video image and the sound were poor and it made it difficult to appreciate and follow the film.  However, Warner's DVD transfer is perfect and the black and white tones are superb.  You will see some film damage in the newsreel portion of the movie, but that was intentionally done when the film was released to convey the illusion of an old, archived film.  The bonus features are also wonderful.  This is probably the third or fourth release of this movie on DVD and this edition is well worth the extra $10 or so for the superior image and sound quality, plus the extra CD bonus material which goes into great depth about Hearst and Welles and examines the great conflict between the two.

It is a pleasure to watch this classic with stunningly crisp picture and sound.This 2 DVD set contains the #1 rated American movie of all time in resored digital transfer with multiple commentary tracks; more importantly, it also contains a narrative documentary that traces the fast-paced life of the young Orson Welles whose career would be dashed over this film.The documentary's thesis - that Kane is essentially an autobiography of Welles superimposed on the canvas of publisher W.R. Hearst's life is a cogent argument and one of the most facinating stories in 20th century America.Both men were willing to sacrifice the truth for spectacle, and both succeeded in radically transforming the world around them. Hearst changed newspapering in America. In the early days he'd pay any price to get the best reporters and editors and turn them against the rich and powerful. Welles equally changed the world of electronic media, showing the world the terror that radio could bring with 'The War of the Worlds' and the political muscle Hollywood could weild with 'Kane.'It might seem that Welles got the last laugh in this showdown.But the documentary is wise to point out that the movie's legacy is the only enduring winner. Movie lovers around the world also win - as 'Kane' is one of the most entertaining and dramatic yarns in cinema history.The audio commentary tracks by Roger Ebert and Welles biographer Peter Bogdanovich are chock full of cinematic insights and interesting anecdotes.And, last but not least, these DVDs are very cheaply priced for a package comparable to a deluxe Criterion Collection edition.

It shows the roots and consequences of narcissism, writ large.  Kudos to Orson Welles.  These points alone make the film an important classic.But:1) The movie, 70 years old, is often slow by modern standards.  It wasn't until about halfway through that I started catching on to why so many call it the best movie of all time.  But this criticism is not that important, and if it were my only one I'd still give the film five stars.2) My big beef:  The film is utterly NON-redemptive.  Although it is brilliant in showing the problem, it does absolutely nothing to suggest, let alone show, a solution -- or even a suggestion that a solution is possible.  I suspect this is because Orson Welles had no realistic idea of how to heal childhood traumas.

297391,A23DFB8IUTIZM0,6302135621,Dan Sherman,"[7, 8]","This is the DVD set that Kane (and most great films) deserve -- an excellent quality print with a very clear recording of its soundtrack. The DVD comes with about 30 index points, so it is very easy to find a particular scene.If you haven't seen it, don't let the fact that Kane is considered to be a ""Great Film"" put you off.  Sure it is famous for all its innovations and clever techniques, but it really is a tremendous amount of fun to watch on its own.  The DVD lets you see a great print of the film, and its extra features (below) let you understand the interesting history behind the film and also some of the technical things that help to make it a ""Great Film.""For me, the best extra feature of the DVD is a newly recorded running commentary by Roger Ebert who plainly loves Kane and really talks us through its many neat visual and sound effects.  Ebert gives us a lot of ""Now watch this..."" that really add to the enjoyment of the film.  There is also a second commentary by the director Peter Bogdanovich who was a good friend of Welles that gives of some sense of what Welles may have been thinking when he made different parts of the film.  Both sets of commentaries have the nice feature that you can hear the original movie underneath them so you know what the commentators are referring to.In addition to the a disk of the film itself, this set has a second DVD that is a really good 2-hour 1996 documentary (seen on PBS) called ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane.""  The documentary presents the lives of Welles and newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst whose life is the thinly disguised subject for the film.  Both men led interesting lives, filled with ego and extragence.  The battle kept Kane from being shown widely and basically ruined the film career of Welles who became the ""youngest has been who ever was"" after Kane premiered (he was 26! or so).  There is lots of interesting file footage of Hearst and Welles, and interviews with those who knew them or have written about them.  For me, one of the engaging moments of the documentary come in an interview with the old Welles saying that he basically wasted his life after Kane -- he should have left films rather than spending 98 percent of his time hustling (his word) to try to get money for his film projects, many of which flopped.This is a great set to have and is a definite buy.

There is no denying that when this film was released in 1941 it was light-years ahead of other films in regard to technique, story-telling, and enough cannot be said about the superlative cinematography by Gregg Toland.  The screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz is superb.  The ensemble acting by the Mercury Theatre troupe is outstanding. Orson Welles had to have the most chutzpah in the world to make a veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst, one of the most powerful men in the world at this time.  But is this (bold letters for effect)THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL-TIME?  In all likelihood, yes.  That said, I would not rank it as one of my favorite films but one I deeply admire.  With apologies to Roger Ebert, this film can probably be best viewed in a film course where it can be analyzed and dissected.  It may just be me, but I hold ""The Godfather"" in higher esteem, a film that is both art and entertains.  A film by Orson Welles that I enjoy more is ""A Touch of Evil"" because it has higher entertainment value(and atmosphere to die for).

I've worked for a charismatic leader and followed him through the trials and tribulations of the business world; some of the scenes seemed much too familiar for comfort.This is a sad, serious movie that dwells on the strengths and weaknesses of a strong leader and the impact of his decisions on the lives of those who followed him. I had no interest in the technical aspects of the movie and watched it without any thought but to simply experience this famous movie.As I started writing this review I was reminded of the story of the individual who was to see the Mona Lisa for the first time and commented to the guard that he wanted to see if it was as good as everyone seemed to think and was told by the guard that the Mona Lisa wasn't on trial, he was. I feel as if I'm on trial as I write this review. Throwing caution to the wind I decided to go ahead and express my thoughts on the movie.This is a somber, sad, movie that examines the life of a bigger than life individual who had a strong influence on the lives of those with whom he came in contact. I found it interesting, and provocative but will probably not want to watch it again for a long time, if ever.Having worked for several years for a man who was similar to Kane in several ways, I found the movie disturbing and too personal.It is a story that everyone should see at least once and I suspect that most will not share my experience and can view the movie with greater objectivity.

I took the class because I thought it would be an easy A.  As it happens, I got a B+.  Anyway, I was prepared for a 2 hour yawn festival.  A cure for insomnia. As it happened, I was hooked by the 'newsreel' footage.  The whole Rosebud thing and Kane himself were a facinating mystery.I thought the characters were better drawn out in 'Kane' than in many of the films I usually enjoyed.  The friendship that Kane &amp; Leland had was particularly well developed.  It just felt like Orson Welles had really put his heart into the film.  One didn't get the impression that he was in it just for the money.  The fact that the film is Black &amp; White just adds to the beauty and mystery of this film.I'm not the type of person who likes a film just becauseit's soooo intellectual.  I do find 'Citizen Kane' to be a very smart film, though, and a film that one needs to pay attention to during their viewing.  Unfortunately, most people see film or TV as a merely passive activity, which you shouldn't have to actively participate in with the ol' noggin.  One really does need to pay attention to the details to really 'get' this film.'Citizen Kane' is a great film, one of the greats of all time.  The greatest of all time?  Beats me.  I have seen too many films and find it impossible to narrow it down to one great film of all time.  'Kane' is even, perhaps, a tad bit over-rated, but I can find very few films made before or since that are as well crafted as 'Citizen Kane'.  Kane proves that one can make a film with a big visual impact without CGI, blue screens, chase scenes, or big explosions.  Perhaps some reviewers were bored with the film because it lacks explosions and enormous dinosaurs!?The DVD package is superb.  The picture quality is very close to perfect. The best quality I've ever seen on a film this old.  It looks better than some of modern films that I've viewed on DVD.The sound is great, too.  It's mono sound, but come on, this film was released in 1941, many decades away from Dolby Digital Stereo sound. The commentaries by Roger Ebert &amp; Peter Bogdanovich are great, with Ebert's being the most informative, in my opinion.  The documentary on disc 2, which is just a few minutes shorter than the actual film gives a lot of insight into the battles had over the film with William Randolph Hearst, who supposedly inspired the film.A very fine package, in my opinion. A film that I definitely plan to view at least a couple times each year.",5,A Great Film...,1015718400,"03 10, 2002",2002,2558,"['first', 'saw', 'Citizen', 'Kane', ""mid-'80s"", 'Intro', 'Film', 'class', 'Community', 'College', 'took', 'class', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'easy', 'A', 'got', 'B+', 'Anyway', 'was', 'prepared', '2', 'hour', 'yawn', 'festival', 'cure', 'insomnia', 'happened', 'was', 'hooked', ""'newsreel"", 'footage', 'whole', 'Rosebud', 'thing', 'Kane', 'were', 'facinating', 'mystery.I', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'better', 'drawn', 'out', ""'Kane"", 'many', 'films', 'usually', 'enjoyed', 'friendship', 'Kane', 'amp', 'Leland', 'had', 'was', 'particularly', 'well', 'developed', 'just', 'felt', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'had', 'really', 'put', 'heart', 'film', 'One', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'impression', 'was', 'just', 'money', 'fact', 'film', 'Black', 'amp', 'White', 'just', 'beauty', 'mystery', 'film.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'type', 'person', 'who', 'film', 'just', 'becauseit', 'soooo', 'intellectual', 'do', 'find', ""'Citizen"", 'Kane', 'be', 'very', 'smart', 'film', 'film', 'one', 'pay', 'attention', 'viewing', 'Unfortunately', 'most', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'TV', 'merely', 'passive', 'activity', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'actively', 'participate', 'ol', 'noggin', 'One', 'really', 'need', 'pay', 'attention', 'details', 'really', ""'get"", 'film', 'Kane', 'great', 'film', 'one', 'greats', 'time', 'greatest', 'time', 'Beats', 'have', 'seen', 'too', 'many', 'films', 'find', 'impossible', 'narrow', 'down', 'one', 'great', 'film', 'time', ""'Kane"", 'even', 'perhaps', 'tad', 'bit', 'over-rated', 'can', 'find', 'very', 'few', 'films', 'made', 'are', 'as', 'well', 'crafted', ""'Citizen"", 'Kane', 'Kane', 'one', 'can', 'make', 'film', 'big', 'visual', 'impact', 'CGI', 'blue', 'screens', 'chase', 'scenes', 'big', 'explosions', 'Perhaps', 'reviewers', 'were', 'bored', 'film', 'explosions', 'enormous', 'dinosaurs', 'DVD', 'package', 'superb', 'picture', 'quality', 'very', 'close', 'perfect', 'best', 'quality', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'film', 'old', 'better', 'modern', 'films', ""'ve"", 'viewed', 'DVD.The', 'sound', 'great', 'too', 'mono', 'sound', 'come', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1941', 'many', 'decades', 'away', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', 'sound', 'commentaries', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'amp', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'are', 'great', 'Ebert', 'being', 'most', 'informative', 'opinion', 'documentary', 'disc', '2', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'shorter', 'actual', 'film', 'lot', 'insight', 'battles', 'had', 'film', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'who', 'supposedly', 'inspired', 'film.A', 'very', 'fine', 'package', 'opinion', 'film', 'definitely', 'plan', 'view', 'least', 'couple', 'times', 'year']",N/A

Let's see, how about we give complete control of a major film to a twenty five year old radio voice with zero film experience (whose claim to fame was scaring the life out of the public with a fake story about aliens landing on earth) and even better, let him staff the movie with actors who have little to no screen experience. On top of that, we'll let it become one of the most controversial pictures of its time because it mirrors the life of one of the biggest names in America today. Why, it may never be able to be released because of the lawsuits-- Great idea!I have just described Citizen Kane. All of the above is true, which makes the fact that it is possibly the greatest film in American Film History even more amazing. Everything is perfect. The script (which Welles co-wrote), the actors (all relative unknowns except Welles and Joseph Cotton), the special effects (listen to Roger Ebert's Commentary on this special edition for details) and finally, the makeup-- You won't believe how great a job they do making 25 year old Welles look 60.As for the story, it's done in a most interesting fashion. Charles Foster Kane (Welles) dies at the very beginning of the movie and utters his famous last word &quot;Rosebud&quot;. A reporter is given the task of finding out just what that one word meant. So he goes and interviews all the people who knew Kane to try to learn the meaning of the word. In the process, we are shown Kane through the eyes of those who knew him. We never see Kane through his own eyes, always what his former associates saw.This is interesting, because Kane is a tragic figure as seen by just about everyone. He is unhappy and lonely. We as an audience eventually learn the meaning of Rosebud. I have read reviews that complain that the movie is about this one thing (I won't reveal what it is). But long before we learn the identity of Rosebud, the film has made its point. What is the point? My opinion is that the film shows us basically the worthlessness and despair of materialism. Loving &quot;stuff&quot; or money will ultimately lead to unhappiness.By the way, this movie almost was never seen. The man I spoke of at the beginning of the review is William Randolph Hearst, former newspaper magnate. He saw too much of himself in the film and sued to squash it. Fortunately he lost. The second disc in the set is a two hour documentary on this topic. It is also excellent and well worth a viewing.One last thing.

297402,A313OU4NOWZDBY,6302135621,David R. Allen,"[1, 5]","About ""Citizen Kane"" (1941).....Orson Welles was famously a self-promoter and opportunist of high skills and great gifts, and the widely accepted reputation of his movie ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) as ""the greatest movie ever made"" is due at least in part to his drum-beating, showmanship efforts over the decades to give the movie that label.In fact, ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) is a tabloid type celebrity scandal story worthy of ""The National Inquirer"" tabloid newspaper and/or scandal magazine (the publication appeared in both forms over the many profitable decades it operated).William Randolph Hearst (in the not too well disguised fictional persona of ""Charles Foster Kane"") is taken to task for having a pretty blonde unmarried ex-chorus girl mistress (Marion Davies named ""Susan Alexander"" in the movie), for living a life of profligate extravagance obviously both immoral and ridiculous, and for getting away with it all.....for living a life into advanced old age where he passes away, finally, in the care of uniformed nurses on duty at one of his mansions certainly as big as one of the Pope's summer palaces or any of French King Louis XIV's residential retreats.In short, ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) ""dishes the dirt"" and wades through sleeze, sleeze, sleeze, all sanitized by the fact the sleeze is perpetrated by a person of wealth and power, a captain of industry of the sort demonized widely and often in the 1941 world then very much in love with Socialism and the philosophy of ""sharing the wealth,"" meaning robbing the rich and spreading assets of rich around for the ""poor"" to share and enjoy.""Rich bad guys"" were very much in vogue in pre-WWII 1941 in the USA as targets for politicians and the media (the ""New Deal"" and Huey Long's ""Share The Wealth"" hustles were two of many examples of the times.....Upton Sinclair's California ""EPIC""....an initialism standing for ""End Poverty In California"" was yet another of fame in the 1930's...).""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was a movie about a bad USA rich guy....tabloid stuff for sure.It was presented using tried and true 1920's German art movie techniques of proved value...extreme close-ups, distorted angles, unusual and rarely used techniques of framing and scene changes.""The Third Man"" (1949) is the other movie of fame and honor Orson Welles made while still a handsome young man (middle 30's in 1949), and it also used eccentric and honored German art film techniques to portray post WWII Vienna, Austria as the dark world of ""Harry Lime,"" the villain (another villain) Welles portrayed in ""The Third Man"" (1949).....BTW, Welles was ""the third man"" referred to in the movie title, even though he was not officially given status as first billed movie star in ""The Third Man"" (1949)....Joseph Cotton was the ""official"" head movie star in that movie.""Citizen Kane"" (1941) became a media event due to the efforts of Orson Welles to make it so, and his efforts continued decades after ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was released, and quickly forgotten by most people.The retrospective (and in ways probably revisionist) history about the movie details....over the decades following 1941...tales of Louis B. Mayer offering almost one million dollars to burn the original negative before the movie is released, tales of the ""battle"" between then 76 year old Hearst and then 25 year old Welles, and blow-by-blow tales of how the movie ""almost never made it to the theaters"" and was ""disappeared"" after a brief release...Welles became a movie star starting with ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), married Rita Hayworth, and was a mainstream Hollywood ""player"" during the 1940's and 1950's until his bad health and old age arrived early ended a not bad 20 year career in movies during which he was seen often on USA and world movie house screens.He even became a player in the world of television, which displaced Hollywood movies by 1960.......who can forget the Orson Welles ""Paul Masson Wine"" TV ads promising the world that Masson wines would never reach wine customers ""before it's time""? ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was and is an OK black and white movie hard to enjoy the first time through which became a long range media event, and still is.It is much more important as a media event and example of promotion and pop-scholarship than it is or was as a movie which stands on its own feet.10 stars for ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for it's place in ""the big picture""......not the same as 10 stars for being a good movie, pure and simple.""Citizen Kane"" (1941) was never ""pure and simple.""-------------Written by Tex (David) Allen, SAG-AFTRA accredited movie actor, movie scholar and movie

Bottom line is ""Citizen Kane"" is a phenomenal piece of film craftsmanship that rewrote all the rules.  Orson Welles, for someone making his first movie, is incredibly ambitious.  He takes all kinds of chances with lighting, camera angles and lenses.  The complexity of the frame within a frame, time splintering story structure has never been duplicated before or since.  Unlike a lot of ""great"" films, ""Kane"" is also very entertaining--dramatic at times, comic at others, but always filled with detail and invention.  Taking on William Randolph Hearst as a subject may not have been the greatest career move on Welles' part, but it does provide the film with an extra resonance for any American citizen.  Hearst was a great historical figure who had an important role in the shaping of this country.  When you look at the rise of tabloid journalism, attack-style politics, and televised celebrity trials, it's easy to see that his legacy endures.  Also, Kane's obsession with collecting and ""buying things"" is especially relevant in our culture of conspicuous consumption.

Although both the story and the special effects do not come close to matching the best that is avialble today, in its time, Citizen Kane was a giant.  A lot of this has to do with the unique storytelling method of using flashbacks.  Virtually the whole story comes across as a reporter, in a futile attempt to discover the identity of the mysterious &quot;rosebud,&quot; makes a series of interviews.  One could argue that the non-chronological structure that results is a predicessor to movies such as &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Memento.&quot;  Another dramatic inovation in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is the dramatic use of lighting.  Legend has it that Orson Welles simply was unaware of the conventions at the time and simply ran around setting things up the way he felt they would be most effective with a team of bewildered technicians following him and correcting his minor flaws.  The end result of the effort is a film that looks totally different than anything that came before it both visually and scriptwise.  Although both of these advancements represent the kind of itellectual leap indicitive of genius, it is ridiculous to assume on these grounds that &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is actually a better movie than something like &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Although neither of those movies might have been made without it, they have definately carried the baton to much greater heights than even &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; could have concieved.  Essentially &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is a movie that is past its time.  The same thing will happen to &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot; and every other movie ever made.  For those of you who appreciate involved, creative filmmaking, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; will always be a masterpice with abundant characteristics to support its title as the greatest film ever made.

Many people are rebelling against this idea because they feel otherwise.  What they don't realize is how silly it is to call any one single film 'the greatest' ever made.  Regardless of how one feels about Orsen Welles' masterwork, there is not doubt that his movie is at least one of the most important and influential films ever created.  It revolutionized they way movies are made; it has groundbreaking originality in camera angles, flashback sequences, screenplay, metaphors and acting.  'Citizen Kane' has one unforgettable sequence after another; it has one of the most haunting openings and hair-raising endings to any film I've ever seen.  It is one of those rare movies that many people could never forget throughout their lifetime.  If I had only seen it once, I still would have been able to remember it sixty years later.  There is no doubt in my mind.No for the double DVD..  'The Battle over Citizen Kane' is just as fascinating as the film itself.  It shows how the career of Orsen Wells was ruined just for making a movie.  He was dealing with people who were much more powerful then he realized.  Some free country we live in, right?

297411,A26ARHFAD8X0WR,6302135621,"D. J. Zabriskie ""zabdart""","[8, 8]","""Citizen Kane"" is probably the most discussed, most written-about movie ever made, as the more than 500 reviews in this column will attest.  Where you stand on its significance and its greatness is pretty much a matter of when you were born.  Most younger viewers (those under 40) tend to be unimpressed and wonder what all the fuss is about; while older viewers remember how there had been nothing quite like it in the history of the movies before it was made and for a good quarter of a century afterwards.This is because the ""film-school"" generation of Hollywood directors, Scorcese, Lukas, Coppola, Spielberg, and De Palma among them, all grew up studying ""Citizen Kane"" to the point where every frame was memorized and incorporated so many of its innovations into their cinematic vocabulary that we now take them for granted.  Therefore, it's important to point out just what was so new and daring about ""Citizen Kane"" in 1941 and for the next 25 years or so.First of all, as Welles would freely admit, ""Citizen Kane"" was a collaborative venture.  RKO gave Welles a crew composed of some of the best technicians in Hollywood, and Welles encouraged them to push the envelope and experiment.  A large part of Welles' genius in making ""Citizen Kane"" was his open-mindedness, his acknowledgement of his ""babe in the woods"" status as filmmaker, and his willingness (later insistence) on exploring new techniques or new ways to use existing techniques.  Welles' indebtedness to previous masters like Lang, Murnau and Eisenstein is pretty obvious.  Yet no one can deny that the cinematic techniques he borrowed from those masters he took to a degree and used to an effect undreamt of in their work.The unsung hero in the making of ""Citizen Kane"" is, of course, cinematographer Gregg Toland.  Toland's use of wide-angle lenses and deep-focus photography became the most salient element of Welles' visual style.  But Orson understood possibilities implicit in that deep-focus photography that Toland had not imagined.  By mounting shots with a distint foreground, main focus and background in deep-focus, Welles managed to simulate three dimensions in a two-dimensional image.  Nobody, not even Toland had done that before, yet it is the hallmark of Welles' visual style, not only in ""Citizen Kane,"" but in all his subsequent work as well.  It would not be until Stanley Kubrick came along that somebody would explore and use the possibilities of cinemascope as effectively as Welles exploits deep-focus in ""Citizen Kane.""The quick-cut editing, whereby a second scene begins with the logical reposte of something in the current scene has become such a standard feature of worldwide cinema that nobody even notices it anymore.  But when Welles ended one scene in ""Citizen Kane"" with Mr. Thatcher saying:""Merry Christmas, Charles,"" and began the next with him saying ""...And a Happy New Year!"" without a pause, it had never been done before.  Likewise, the fade-in, fade-out sequences where one character narrates a particular scene on one side of the screen and fades out, while the scene fades in on the other side of the screen until it dominates the whole screen is a technique common in movies today, but it began with ""Citizen Kane.""One of the signature features of Welles' visual style, begun with ""Citizen Kane"" is beginning the movie with a ""processional"" scene.  In ""Othello,"" for example, the movie begins with a literal funeral procession.  Then there is that famous, long, uninterrupted tracking shot that begins ""Touch of Evil.""  The effect is to put the viewer immediately and specifically in the world of the story and its characters.  It's a technique Welles did in spades in the opening of ""Citizen Kane,"" as the camera (and therefore, the audience) processes across the grounds of Xanadu, from the gate, past the docks of the artificial lake, past the private zoo, the staturary, up the hill to the mansion and finally into Kane's bedroom.Although no other director in history packed as much visual information into each and every frame of his movies (and all of that detail is significant!) as did Orson Welles, he could be an astonishing minimalist when he chose to be.  The most brilliant use of sound in ""Citizen Kane"" is when Kane speaks his last word, ""Rosebud"" while holding a paper-weight depicting a winter scene.Then Kane loses his grip (a symbollic detail), drops the globe to the floor, where it shatters, while we hear NOTHING.  Then he dies.  The symbolism of the pre-figuring contained in this scene determines the course of the entire movie and encapsulates the humanity at its heart.

Orson Welles's initial motion picture effort, CITIZEN KANE, not only is Welles's best film--it's the best film ever made.  Because of the story?  Well, that's certainly interesting enough in its own right, but it's not the reason this powerful film is the best ever captured on celluloid.  Look, any film that spawns books, documentaries, commentaries, and makes countless ""Best Films of All Time"" lists has got something unique and magical going for it.  So what is it?  To explore this topic, I highly recommend you get this TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION of CITIZEN KANE.Made in 1941, when Welles was a mere twenty-five, CITIZEN KANE was light years ahead of its time in production, imagery, lighting, sets--unparalleled cinematography.  Easily one of the most creative and innovative of all films, CITIZEN KANE is a haunting presentation of moving camera shots (often through what are supposed to be inanimate objects), of rooms with low ceilings made of cloth (for lighting purposes, plus the cloth easily hid the boom mikes), of scene lighting contrasts where one character is in light, the other in total silhouette, of scenes shot entirely by a below-ground-level camera, of surreal close-ups, of a despondent Kane walking across the screen, his reflection captured in hundreds of mirrors.  All of the visual tricks and optical illusions serve to enhance and symbolize the story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon so extravagant and outrageous in his efforts to attract acceptance and love he ultimately garners neither--and loses everything, especially a connection to his childhood.  (""Rosebud."")  That Welles was making a thinly-disguised biography of mogul William Randolph Hearst was lost on no one, especially Hearst, who made so much trouble with RKO Studios the film was quickly shelved, and didn't find an appreciative audience until years later.While this special edition contains several extras, you must view movie critic Roger Ebert's commentary.  Ebert, an unabashed and enthusiastic student and fan of CITIZEN KANE, is a wealth of information about all the scenes and their background history, about all the tricks and gimmicks and optical illusions Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland (the real star of this movie) dreamed up to make watching this film so mesmerizing.  For supporting actors, Welles brought over his Mercury Theater radio performers, who all made their screen debuts here, including Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore (playing a very shrill and petulant second wife), Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Everett Sloane, and William Alland (a longtime Welles assistant).  On disc two you'll find the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane,"" a 1996 PBS production; it explores the lives of Hearst, Welles, and the controversy surrounding the production of CITIZEN KANE in meticulous and fascinating detail.

""Citizen Kane"" has been analyzed more than any other movie, in part because the story behind the making of the film is as interesting as the movie itself.  It's therefore appropriate that this special edition also includes the 1995 documentary, ""The Battle over Citizen Kane.""Despite ""Kane's"" continued status as ""greatest film ever,"" I'm amazed at how many people I encounter who haven't seen it, or worse yet, who watched it only once and thought it was just OK.  Believe me: seeing it once is simply not enough!  This is true of any great film, but more so for ""Kane,"" which contains countless layers, subtexts, and details that are simply impossible to absorb the first time.  In many ways, ""Kane"" is the Bible of modern cinema: you'll find something new each time you watch it.Orson Welles' astonishing directorial debut is a tour de force of cinematic technique, narrative innovation and ensemble acting. The story of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper tycoon based more or less on William Randolph Hearst, unfolds in imaginatively designed flashbacks.  Welles and cinematographer Gregg Toland employ chiaroscuro lighting and deep focus photography to create an evocative and rich tapestry that rewards repeated viewing. Welles, as Kane, ages 50 years over the course of the film, aided by makeup artist Maurice Seiderman's wizardry.  Welles' Mercury Players, including Joseph Cotten, Agnes Moorehead, Ruth Warrick, Ray Collins, Everett Sloane, and Erskine Sanford, round out an impressive cast.The bonus documentary, ""The Battle over Citizen Kane,"" is expertly produced, but belabors the comparison between the careers of Hearst and Welles.  Both were certainly ambitious men, and Charles Foster Kane is based as much on Welles as on Hearst, but the similarities end shortly thereafter.  By repeating the popular wisdom that Welles didn't accomplish much after ""Kane,"" the documentary unfairly simplifies Welles' career.  Welles made several great films of the course of his career, two of which (1958's ""Touch of Evil"" and 1966's ""Chimes at Midnight"") are often cited by Welles scholars as superior to ""Kane.""The greatest movie of all time?  Quite possibly, though I believe that ""Touch of Evil"" is even better among Welles' own films.  But ""Kane"" is more inexhaustible, and more conducive to repeated viewing and in-depth study. ""Citizen Kane"" has topped the ""Sight and Sound"" critics' and directors' polls since 1962, and its #1 status was reinforced yet again in 1998's American Film Institute Top 100 list.

297421,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6302135621,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","Laying claim to being the greatest movie ever made is bound to attract extensive essays from cineastes dismantling the film every which way ad infinitum. Suffice it to say that Orson Welles' first-time effort as a filmmaker remains an astonishing and often unparalleled work. Only 25 years old at the time, he provides an audacious vision in which all the parts of this 1941 masterpiece fit perfectly together with a furious precision. Moreover, there is a consistently precocious tone throughout that a more veteran director could not possibly capture, and this is what makes the film truly unique. It manifests itself in several complementary ways, whether it's the groundbreaking deep-focus cinematography of Gregg Toland, or the propulsive editing by Welles and future director Robert Wise, or the involving whodunit quality of Welles' and Herman Mankiewicz's sharp screenplay, or the meaty performances of a then-unknown cast of stage actors. The beauty of the film comes from the simple fact that no single component dominates the other.The result is as cohesive a vision as has likely been seen onscreen and one that Welles was never able to recapture for the rest of his life no matter how hard he tried. The film examines the life of a William Randolph Hearst doppelganger named Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who has amassed a fortune and more than a few enemies. The plot revolves around the mysterious utterance of ""Rosebud"" as Kane's dying words and how an investigative reporter interviews the people in Kane's life to find out the hidden meaning of that word. The interviews provide the means for selective flashbacks to his lonely childhood, his beginnings as a yellow journalist in building a publishing empire with closest confidante Jedidiah Leland, his first marriage to wealthy socialite Emily Norton, his scandal-laden run for governor, his obsession in turning second wife Susan Alexander into a world-class opera singer, and his sad decline at his isolated mountaintop estate, Xanadu.The film combines a first-rate detective story with a classic tragedy about wealth and power and the inevitable ruin that comes from Kane's unrelenting self-absorption. It is startling how convincing Welles is as an aging magnate, and his naturally larger-than-life persona fits nicely into the Shakespearean contours of the character. The cast consists entirely of his Mercury Theater troupe with Joseph Cotten a particular standout as Leland. I always found Dorothy Comingore a bit too cartoonish as Susan, the character inspired by real-life movie star Marion Davies, Hearst's long-time mistress, but more subtle turns by Agnes Moorehead as Kane's mother and Ruth Warrick as Emily more than compensate.The 60th Anniversary, two-disc DVD set has enough material to please Kane aficionados beginning with two separate but equally valuable commentary tracks, one by director and Welles confidante Peter Bogdanovich and the other by film critic Roger Ebert. Bogdanovich is more academic in his approach even though he had the personal relationship with Welles, while Ebert can barely contain his enthusiasm with each scene he describes. The first disc also contains the original trailer, a brief newsreel of the film's New York premiere and three sections of intriguing material focusing on the production, post-production and the press book. The second disc contains a fascinating 1996 documentary feature, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"", which focuses on Hearst's attempts to ruin the film. To put it mildly, this DVD set reflects essential viewing.",5,"A Young Man's Audacious, Precocious and Fully Realized Cinematic Vision",1176854400,"04 18, 2007",2007,3570,"['Laying', 'claim', 'being', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'bound', 'attract', 'extensive', 'essays', 'cineastes', 'dismantling', 'film', 'way', 'ad', 'infinitum', 'Suffice', 'say', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'first-time', 'effort', 'filmmaker', 'astonishing', 'often', 'unparalleled', 'work', 'Only', '25', 'years', 'old', 'time', 'audacious', 'vision', 'parts', '1941', 'masterpiece', 'fit', 'perfectly', 'together', 'furious', 'precision', 'Moreover', 'consistently', 'precocious', 'tone', 'more', 'veteran', 'director', 'could', 'not', 'possibly', 'capture', 'film', 'truly', 'unique', 'several', 'complementary', 'ways', 'groundbreaking', 'deep-focus', 'cinematography', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'propulsive', 'editing', 'Welles', 'future', 'director', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'involving', 'whodunit', 'quality', 'Welles', 'Herman', 'Mankiewicz', 'sharp', 'screenplay', 'meaty', 'performances', 'then-unknown', 'cast', 'stage', 'actors', 'beauty', 'film', 'simple', 'fact', 'single', 'component', 'other.The', 'result', 'cohesive', 'vision', 'likely', 'been', 'seen', 'onscreen', 'one', 'Welles', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'recapture', 'rest', 'life', 'matter', 'how', 'hard', 'tried', 'film', 'life', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'doppelganger', 'named', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'newspaper', 'publisher', 'who', 'amassed', 'fortune', 'more', 'few', 'enemies', 'plot', 'mysterious', 'utterance', 'Rosebud', 'Kane', 'dying', 'words', 'how', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'people', 'Kane', 'life', 'find', 'out', 'hidden', 'meaning', 'word', 'interviews', 'provide', 'means', 'selective', 'flashbacks', 'lonely', 'childhood', 'beginnings', 'yellow', 'journalist', 'building', 'publishing', 'empire', 'closest', 'confidante', 'Jedidiah', 'Leland', 'first', 'marriage', 'wealthy', 'socialite', 'Emily', 'Norton', 'scandal-laden', 'run', 'governor', 'obsession', 'turning', 'second', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Alexander', 'world-class', 'opera', 'singer', 'sad', 'decline', 'isolated', 'mountaintop', 'estate', 'Xanadu.The', 'film', 'combines', 'first-rate', 'detective', 'story', 'classic', 'tragedy', 'wealth', 'power', 'inevitable', 'ruin', 'Kane', 'unrelenting', 'self-absorption', 'startling', 'how', 'convincing', 'Welles', 'aging', 'magnate', 'naturally', 'larger-than-life', 'persona', 'nicely', 'Shakespearean', 'contours', 'character', 'cast', 'entirely', 'Mercury', 'Theater', 'troupe', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'particular', 'standout', 'Leland', 'always', 'found', 'Dorothy', 'Comingore', 'bit', 'too', 'cartoonish', 'Susan', 'character', 'inspired', 'real-life', 'movie', 'star', 'Marion', 'Davies', 'Hearst', 'long-time', 'mistress', 'more', 'subtle', 'turns', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'Kane', 'mother', 'Ruth', 'Warrick', 'Emily', 'more', 'compensate.The', '60th', 'Anniversary', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'set', 'enough', 'material', 'please', 'Kane', 'beginning', 'two', 'separate', 'equally', 'valuable', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'director', 'Welles', 'confidante', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'other', 'film', 'critic', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'Bogdanovich', 'more', 'academic', 'approach', 'even', 'had', 'personal', 'relationship', 'Welles', 'Ebert', 'can', 'barely', 'contain', 'enthusiasm', 'scene', 'first', 'disc', 'also', 'original', 'trailer', 'brief', 'newsreel', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'premiere', 'three', 'sections', 'intriguing', 'material', 'focusing', 'production', 'post-production', 'press', 'book', 'second', 'disc', 'fascinating', '1996', 'documentary', 'feature', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Hearst', 'attempts', 'ruin', 'film', 'put', 'mildly', 'DVD', 'set', 'essential', 'viewing']",N/A

To get to the point, though, there IS a reason for all this fuss. Admittedly, Citizen Kane may not be THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME because that title really doesn't have any meaning - there are so many types of films that to compare them ALL in one category is ridiculous.Nevertheless, as stated earlier, there is a reason why Citizen Kane has been ranked as it has. Although it is easy to dismiss Citizen Kane as no longer being as groundbreaking as it once was, this is a silly way to approach film. So what if it is no longer new technologically? Watched as objectively as possible, like any other film, Citizen Kane is very entertaining and has many obvious merits. For instance, the acting is top notch, as is the insightful, cynical script. Yes, the cinematography is good too.Just in case there are people out there who aren't familiar with the plot of this film, it is a series of flashbacks on the life of Charles Foster Kane, a man who controlled numerous newspapers and a vast fortune. Many films dealing with tycoons have been made before and since Citizen Kane, but none have been able to deal with the topic as brilliantly as Orson Welles did in his remarkable debut.Anyhow, it may be that Citizen Kane has aged some, and it is hard to identify ONE FILM as the greatest of all time. But after watching Citizen Kane with an open mind it becomes clear why people might rate it as such - from start to finish, this is a beautifully rendered, interesting, and amusing film.

Speaking of the ending, it has got to be one of the most powerful endings that I've seen--but you have to be patient. Everything from the dialogue to the camera angle, EVERYTHING is PERFECT in that ending. Some people say how the ending in the Sixth Sense was good, but the Sixth Sense is NOTHING compared to the ending in this movie. But the movie's basic message is this: The most significant things in life are things that are seemingly insignificant. One reason why this movie is so powerful is because it was based on a real person. Most of us knew or now know that this movie is modeled after the life of William Randolph Hearst. They say that this movie is the best movie of the century, but this is one of those movies where if you deleted the ending or changed it in any way, it would go from a five star movie to a three star movie or less, really quick.

The reason for this is that this film contains so much that has later become standard in movies. The gorgous photography, which looks even better on this magnificent DVD, the acting, dialogue, music, story, special effects. Everything about this movie is done perfectly. When one sees this film, it seems as though the film costed almost as much as any high budget film in Hollywood, but it wasn't. Welles planned the film down to each shot, which is why he made those transitions so perfectly and seemlessly.(...)This film, like all films made in the sound period before 1953, was photographed in the Academy ratio, which was 1.37:1. Since the television screen has an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, would the picture have minor cuts on the sides. This film, though, is photographed making full use of the width of the screen, so on the Criterion laserdisc version of this film were there a couple of scenes that the extreme left or right side was cropped, but on this transfer have they fixed this. If one talks about that a film that was orginally filmed at a ratio of 1.37:1 would have to be letterboxed to be able to see the whole picture, is that person just being silly. It simply would not be worth the effort, in comparision to transfering films that were filmed in the old Cinemascope ratios of 2.35:1 and 2.55:1 that would badly need letterboxing.

Having seen the film a couple of times, I understand why it recieves such accolades. I also understand why it recieves negative reviews. I will be counted among those who believe Citizen Kane to be a truly great film. Even beyond its &quot;Greatest-American-Movie&quot; status, it's a remarkable viewing experience. On my first viewing, several years ago, indeed, I had trouble staying awake. However, I watched it again last year, and I was completely engrossed until the very last frame. I loved it. Every bit of it, from the story to the acting to the photography.However, its easy to understand why other such movies as Casablanca and Gone With The Wind are bigger crowd pleasers while Citizen Kane is pretty much revered solely among film buffs and critics. Those two movies are closer to the typical Hollywood formula. While they don't exactly have happy endings, romance is a big part of their storylines. Citizen Kane is not a romance. It's more about the man himself than his relationship with his wife. Those films also contain more obvious, straightforward narratives than Citizen Kane. Kane is more like a montage than a narrative. Most people seem to prefer a conventional narrative in movies. That could be two reasons why Citizen Kane isn't more highly regarded among the casual moviegoer.I will say this also. The people who make the claim that Citizen Kane is the greatest American movie are people who are generally a lot more familiar with the overall scope of American film than I or most of the reviewers here. They are film scholars, not just casual movie viewers. People who see Citizen Kane in its historical context and not just as an old movie. People who see Citizen Kane in relation to the grand scope of film history. I cannot make the claim that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie of all time. For one thing, I have not seen every movie ever made and I'm not familiar enough with the world of cinema (especially the early half of the 20th century) to even begin to make that claim. However, the people that do make this claim are people that truly know the world of film and study every aspect of it.

Its agrees with one of my ideas on lives lived that for all the apparent heat and firey fire there are plenty of untold stories or nuances we are never to know. This includes history too. Or there are lives that get all the attention and warmth but there are more mysterious and intriguing ones we will never know; secrets they could tell but they go up in bulk as smoke into the moonlit sky. Or the too many lives and story that are obscure yet lived in great earnestness at their time.Well, rosebud refers to that she really was the one true love because of the big sexual intimacy they had. Think of it, rosebud as labial entrance and connotations of beauty and purity. Also, for the times it was indecent to dwell on sex too explicitly or place great import.But look at Kane, he does everything ELSE on a grand scale. Power always goes hand in hand with libido or /and gfreater availability of consorts.Then there is the biology that men feel more from their groin first than women including emotions whilst women have far more erogenous zones.Rosebud is almost a riddle at the end of the film .Because deep sexual relations are a private business. Is not just the prudery of the times. Orson Wells on screen - he's such a giant soul and artist that its as though he leaves a partial foot print from which we deduce a giant., given the overlap between Kane and Wells as both giants. So a certain amount is great heat and light that is immediate .

297440,A3CWH6VKCTJAD,6302135621,"""flickjunkie""","[656, 691]","Probably the most unfortunate thing that ever happened to `Citizen Kane' was that it found itself atop the AFI top film list.  Now, no one can simply enjoy the film.  Everyone feels compelled to scrutinize it and make  a decision about its greatness.  Asking whether `Citizen Kane' is the best  film of the century is like asking if Marilyn Monroe was the most beautiful  woman.  It depends on whom you ask.`Citizen Kane' is not the most  entertaining film I've ever seen, but it is certainly one of the most  important.  It is a vanguard motion picture and a gargantuan achievement  for Orson Welles.  If you consider the fact that Welles was a 24 year old  Hollywood outsider who had only done radio and theater when he landed the  contract for this film, you begin to appreciate what a big deal it was.  This was during a time when a few studios controlled every film that was  made. How many 24 year old actor/directors can you name today, even in a  world where independents abound?The story is based on the life of  William Randolph Hearst.  Writer Herman Mankiewicz had an up-close look at  Hearst as he had been an occasional house guest at the Hearst mansion.  The  similarities were striking, right down to the paramour whose career Hearst  promoted, who loved to do jigsaw puzzles.  The fact that this film was  released at all is a marvel in itself.  Hearst went on a personal campaign  to crush the film and enlisted every powerful friend he had to stop it.  Louis B. Mayer offered RKO $800,000 to destroy the print.  John D.  Rockefeller ordered the Radio City premier cancelled.  All of Hearst's  newspapers were forbidden to mention the film.Hollywood was uniformly  against it and Welles was branded an insolent maverick.  The film was  snubbed by the Academy.  It was nominated for 9 Oscars and won only best  screenplay.  The film turned out to be a commercial failure, losing  $150,000.  With all the forces stacked against it, we are lucky to be  having this best film debate at all.The story has a simple moral; that  money and power can't buy happiness.  We see Kane's progress from a happy  child, to an idealistic young journalist intent on helping the common man,  and finally to a bitter and angry old man whose innocence has slipped from  him.  One of the most effective scenes that illustrated this was the two  minute overlay of breakfast conversations with his wife.  It starts with  cooing lovers and progresses through increasing levels of discord.  It ends  in silence with the two reading separate newspapers, her disdain for him  subtly indicated by her choice of the hated Chronicle as her  newspaper.What is so remarkable about this film is the filmmaking.  Director after director has pointed to some aspect of this film as having  influenced them.  The use of shadows and various perspective shots was not  unprecedented in 1941, but never before had they been used with so much  dramatic impact.  What was unprecedented was that `Citizen Kane' was the  first film ever to depart from the strict narrative format, which moves  forward chronologically.  The film starts at the end and jumps around in  time based upon the perspective of the person who is telling his or her  story about Kane.  So the next time you see a flashback, remember it  started here.The makeup was revolutionary.  Welles often went through  four hours or more of makeup to be properly aged for each scene.  The film  also launched a number of brilliant careers.  Besides Welles, Joseph Cotton  and Agnes Moorehead went on to long and prominent film careers.If  `Citizen Kane' is not the best film of the century it is certainly one of  them.  Its influence on a generation of filmmakers cannot be ignored in the  equation.  People who watch this film and ask, ""What's the big deal?"" are  comparing it with modern films that have borrowed from this film's  techniques and undergone 60 years of evolution.  It's like going back to  Kitty Hawk and saying, ""What's the big deal, the flight only lasted a few  seconds.""There is only one rating to give to a film of such monumental  importance.  It is the consummate 10.",5,A vanguard motion picture,960163200,"06 5, 2000",2000,4128,"['Probably', 'most', 'unfortunate', 'thing', 'ever', 'happened', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'found', 'AFI', 'top', 'film', 'list', 'Now', 'one', 'can', 'simply', 'enjoy', 'film', 'Everyone', 'feels', 'compelled', 'scrutinize', 'make', 'decision', 'greatness', 'Asking', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'best', 'film', 'century', 'asking', 'Marilyn', 'Monroe', 'was', 'most', 'beautiful', 'woman', 'whom', 'ask.', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'not', 'most', 'entertaining', 'film', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'certainly', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'vanguard', 'motion', 'picture', 'gargantuan', 'achievement', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'consider', 'fact', 'Welles', 'was', '24', 'year', 'old', 'Hollywood', 'outsider', 'who', 'had', 'only', 'done', 'radio', 'theater', 'when', 'landed', 'contract', 'film', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'what', 'big', 'deal', 'was', 'was', 'time', 'when', 'few', 'studios', 'controlled', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'How', 'many', '24', 'year', 'old', 'actor/directors', 'can', 'name', 'today', 'even', 'world', 'where', 'independents', 'story', 'based', 'life', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'Writer', 'Herman', 'Mankiewicz', 'had', 'up-close', 'look', 'Hearst', 'had', 'been', 'occasional', 'house', 'guest', 'Hearst', 'mansion', 'similarities', 'were', 'striking', 'right', 'down', 'paramour', 'career', 'Hearst', 'promoted', 'who', 'loved', 'do', 'jigsaw', 'puzzles', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'marvel', 'Hearst', 'went', 'personal', 'campaign', 'crush', 'film', 'enlisted', 'powerful', 'friend', 'had', 'stop', 'Louis', 'B.', 'Mayer', 'offered', 'RKO', '800,000', 'destroy', 'print', 'John', 'D.', 'Rockefeller', 'ordered', 'Radio', 'City', 'premier', 'cancelled', 'Hearst', 'newspapers', 'were', 'forbidden', 'mention', 'film.Hollywood', 'was', 'uniformly', 'Welles', 'was', 'branded', 'insolent', 'maverick', 'film', 'was', 'snubbed', 'Academy', 'was', 'nominated', '9', 'Oscars', 'won', 'only', 'best', 'screenplay', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'commercial', 'failure', 'losing', '150,000', 'forces', 'stacked', 'are', 'lucky', 'be', 'having', 'best', 'film', 'debate', 'all.The', 'story', 'simple', 'moral', 'money', 'power', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'see', 'Kane', 'progress', 'happy', 'child', 'idealistic', 'young', 'journalist', 'intent', 'helping', 'common', 'man', 'finally', 'bitter', 'angry', 'old', 'man', 'innocence', 'slipped', 'One', 'most', 'effective', 'scenes', 'illustrated', 'was', 'two', 'minute', 'overlay', 'breakfast', 'conversations', 'wife', 'cooing', 'lovers', 'increasing', 'levels', 'discord', 'silence', 'two', 'reading', 'separate', 'newspapers', 'disdain', 'subtly', 'indicated', 'choice', 'hated', 'Chronicle', 'newspaper.What', 'so', 'remarkable', 'film', 'filmmaking', 'Director', 'director', 'pointed', 'aspect', 'film', 'having', 'influenced', 'use', 'shadows', 'various', 'perspective', 'shots', 'was', 'not', 'unprecedented', '1941', 'never', 'before', 'had', 'been', 'used', 'so', 'much', 'dramatic', 'impact', 'What', 'was', 'unprecedented', 'was', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'first', 'film', 'ever', 'depart', 'strict', 'narrative', 'format', 'forward', 'chronologically', 'film', 'end', 'jumps', 'time', 'based', 'perspective', 'person', 'who', 'telling', 'story', 'Kane', 'next', 'time', 'see', 'flashback', 'remember', 'started', 'here.The', 'makeup', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'Welles', 'often', 'went', 'four', 'hours', 'more', 'makeup', 'be', 'properly', 'aged', 'scene', 'film', 'also', 'launched', 'number', 'brilliant', 'careers', 'Welles', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'went', 'long', 'prominent', 'film', 'careers.If', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'century', 'certainly', 'one', 'influence', 'generation', 'filmmakers', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'ignored', 'equation', 'People', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'ask', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'are', 'comparing', 'modern', 'films', 'have', 'borrowed', 'film', 'techniques', 'undergone', '60', 'years', 'evolution', 'going', 'back', 'Kitty', 'Hawk', 'saying', 'What', 'big', 'deal', 'flight', 'only', 'lasted', 'few', 'seconds', 'only', 'one', 'rating', 'give', 'film', 'such', 'monumental', 'importance', 'consummate', '10']",N/A

As the camera closes in on a great mansion we are given a first hand view of a dying man and his mysterious final word ""Rosebud."" In the following newsreel we learn the man was Charles Foster Kane (Welles), a millionaire tycoon and newspaper man. A journalist is enlisted to find out anything he can about Kane. He scours the memoirs of Kane's deceased childhood guardian. Then, he talks with Mr. Bernstein who worked with Kane's paper the Inquirer. He gets around to talking to Kane's unstable former friend Jedediah Leland as well as Kane's second wife. We learn from these accounts about his early years, his success with yellow journalism, the evolution of his first marriage, and the rise and fall of his political career. Furthermore, we find out about Kane's unhappy second marriage that ultimately left him loveless after looking for affection his whole life. Fittingly, we are again left with the bleak view of his fortress Xanadu and we now have the knowledge that ""Rosebud"" was in fact utterly trivial.Obviously, Greg Toland's black and white cinematography using deep focus and low camera angles is wonderful. The framing of the narrative with different points of view and flashbacks was unique at the time. The actors age in front of us showing the progression of time and montage is used to effectively condense time. There is the overlapping and fragmentation of dialogue to create a realistic feel throughout the film. Bernard Hermann puts together a score that slowly changes along with Kane. And of course you have the supposed basis of Kane on William Randolph Hearst. Historically, Citizen Kane may in fact be the most important film and artistically it is certainly up there with the best of them.

297443,ACVNA57PI4DLV,6302135621,Francois Tremblay,"[11, 14]","Citizen Kane is considered by many, with Casablanca, to be the best American movie in history. Although I am not an avid movie-goer or a film buff, I can't disagree with that appreciation. It is certainly the greatest movie I have ever seen.Despite being in b/w, Welles' use of light and camera angles is nothing short of stunning, esp. the group scene after the first newsreel. One little problem, though : I don't know if it's because of this recording in particular, but the sound volume grows terribly loud as the movie progresses, so keep your remote in hand.But the most incredible aspect of this movie is without a doubt the story. We follow the quest of a journalist as he is assigned to find out the meaning behind Charles Kane's dying word : &quot;rosebud&quot;. The journalist goes to talk to many people who knew Kane during his life, and gives rise to numerous flashbacks of their contacts with Kane.Despite his never-ending wealth and ambition, Charles Foster Kane is a complex and tortured man. He runs a newspaper empire, attempts to run for governor, and erects a gargantuan castle called &quot;Xanadu&quot;, where he cannot find peace.

Others need non-stop action with fancy special effects and crystal clear colour enhanced with CGI if necessary before they would even consider the content as a candidate for greatness.  For me, a movie has to have substance and it has to move me with an abiding message that never gets old even with repeated viewing.Like another reviewer, I agree that what makes this movie for me other than the innovative manner of telling a story using flashbacks and excellent acting and directing is the message that the movie is trying to put across and ""Citizen Kane"" does this extremely well indeed.  For me this movie proves that our actions and what we eventually become are inextricably linked to how we treat one another and how we in turn are treated.  We see young Kane as a relatively well-balanced kid who is suddenly traumatised with a shocking dislocation from his familiar and loving family background to embark upon a life not of his own choosing.  Charles Foster Kane becomes what he becomes as a consequence of this probably feeling that a lack of parental love and a lack of control over his life is what led to his involuntary departure from his ""Eden"" subsequently over compensates and results in his self-destructive and generally despised future behaviour.  I found myself greatly sympathising with Welles' character and it helped me understand my own life too.  This movie touched me deeply and the great acting, directing etc was a nice plus too.This 2-disc version is a real treat for fans as well as the picture quality is brilliantly restored; the only thing I would have liked to have is an option for Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 or DTS with THX quality sound.  They were able to do it with ""Gone With the Wind"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" etc and so they really should be able to go all out for this of all films.

(Makes me sad for all of the classics that only exist in scratchy old dupes; not to mention the ones that don't exist at all any more.)  The extras-- documentary, commentaries, etc.-- are also excellent.  You simply can't ask for a better video presentation (well, short of an HDTV disk).As for the movie itself, well, I like Welles' followup, &quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot; a little better, but I have no problem with calling Kane the greatest film ever made.  If you've never seen it (which is likely, since you're reading this), be warned that there's no one thing you'll see that'll make you see the greatness.  In fact, that's kind of what the movie itself is about: looking for simple answers when life is much too complex for that.Also understand that there's a difference (or there *can be*) between a film that you think is the &quot;greatest&quot; and one that is your &quot;favorite&quot;.  There might be movies I watch more often than Kane, but I still think it's (at the very least) one of the top three or four greatest.  To use a lame analogy, the music you think is the &quot;greatest&quot; is probably not what you've got in your CD player right now.Here's some of what to look for in Kane, if you've never seen it:The amazing cinematography (the Ebert commentary provides a lot of insight into it, but watch the movie first), which is still a major influence today.+ The acting, all of which is great.+ The screenplay, which gives us a large number of multi-layered characters, tightly woven together in a structure that was (and maybe still is) as unique in its day as &quot;Memento&quot; is today.+ The editing, which working in tandem with the cinematography and screenplay is not only revolutionary, but cleverly brings more depth to the film by guiding us through it in a very deliberate way.I guess I'll stop here.  Again, my advice, though I know it's hard to do, is to just watch the film with an open mind, not with a stubborn &quot;OK, let's see what's so great about this God damned movie&quot; attitude.  And think about it afterward.  Maybe even watch it (or parts of it) with the Ebert commentary.Enjoy!",5,Stunning quality DVD!

This is a difficult test, particularly for films that largely rely upon new technology and innovative technique for impact: as these new effects are seen more often in other films, we come to accept them as standard, and in consequence the film that introduced them no longer has same the freshness as once it did.To a certain extent CITIZEN KANE faces precisely this problem.  A pioneer in the use of deep focus photography and in innovative editing, KANE stunned audiences of its day with a powerful visual and aural montage.  Some forty years later, however, most filmgoers have had at least some opportunity to see other and later films that at least approximate KANE's effects; consequently, these elements lack the same impact they once had, and the film must increasingly rely upon story, script, and performances for continued appeal.  And it is here that KANE runs into a bit of trouble.  The story KANE tells is quite cold, and although the script has incredible precision, bite, and complexity, it ultimately presents its characters as second-rate personalities who prove unable to transform their lives into anything beyond the pathos they so deplore.  They are not likable enough to be sympathetic, they are not dark enough to fully stir our curiosity, and for all Charles Foster Kane's millions they ultimately emerge as merely so many opportunity-squandering unfortunates.  As such, while they certainly engage the viewer in an intellectual sense, they seldom engage the viewer in an emotional one; this coupled with the fact that the film's technique no longers offers quite the same shock-of-the-new as once it did makes CITIZEN KANE increasingly problematic with the passage of time.There is a tremendous amount to admire in CITIZEN KANE, but with each passing year it becomes more and more of a historian's darling and less and less of a film that remains able to engage a purely casual viewer at all levels.  Even so, it is (and will no doubt for the foreseeable future remain) a landmark film, one that will be worthy of considerable reverence for many years to come.",4,Increasingly Problematic With The Passage Of Time,1011052800,"01 15, 2002",2002,2210,"['order', 'survive', 'passing', 'years', 'film', 'must', 'be', 'able', 'transcend', 'limitations', 'era', 'was', 'made', 'difficult', 'test', 'particularly', 'films', 'largely', 'rely', 'new', 'technology', 'innovative', 'technique', 'impact', 'new', 'effects', 'are', 'seen', 'more', 'often', 'other', 'films', 'come', 'accept', 'standard', 'consequence', 'film', 'introduced', 'no', 'longer', 'same', 'freshness', 'certain', 'extent', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'precisely', 'problem', 'pioneer', 'use', 'deep', 'focus', 'photography', 'innovative', 'editing', 'KANE', 'stunned', 'audiences', 'day', 'powerful', 'visual', 'aural', 'montage', 'forty', 'years', 'later', 'however', 'most', 'filmgoers', 'have', 'had', 'least', 'opportunity', 'see', 'other', 'later', 'films', 'least', 'approximate', 'KANE', 'effects', 'consequently', 'elements', 'lack', 'same', 'impact', 'once', 'had', 'film', 'must', 'increasingly', 'rely', 'story', 'script', 'performances', 'continued', 'appeal', 'here', 'KANE', 'bit', 'trouble', 'story', 'KANE', 'quite', 'cold', 'script', 'incredible', 'precision', 'bite', 'complexity', 'ultimately', 'characters', 'second-rate', 'personalities', 'who', 'prove', 'unable', 'transform', 'lives', 'anything', 'pathos', 'so', 'deplore', 'are', 'not', 'likable', 'enough', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'are', 'not', 'dark', 'enough', 'fully', 'stir', 'curiosity', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'millions', 'ultimately', 'emerge', 'merely', 'many', 'opportunity-squandering', 'unfortunates', 'such', 'certainly', 'engage', 'viewer', 'intellectual', 'sense', 'seldom', 'engage', 'viewer', 'emotional', 'one', 'coupled', 'fact', 'film', 'technique', 'longers', 'quite', 'same', 'shock-of-the-new', 'did', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'increasingly', 'problematic', 'passage', 'time.There', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'admire', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'passing', 'year', 'more', 'more', 'historian', 'darling', 'less', 'less', 'film', 'able', 'engage', 'purely', 'casual', 'viewer', 'levels', 'Even', 'so', 'will', 'doubt', 'foreseeable', 'future', 'remain', 'landmark', 'film', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'worthy', 'considerable', 'reverence', 'many', 'years', 'come']",N/A

It seems unnecessary to write another review proclaiming its brilliance, while to say anything else seems like sacrilige. The only way I think that this can be done is by considering each aspect of the film one at a time.""Citizen Kane"" is the story of multi-millionaire Charles Foster Kane, told by those who knew him, to a journalist, after his death. It is said to be based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, who attempted, unsuccessfully, to have the film suppressed upon its release.Technically, ""Citizen Kane"" is a brilliant film. From a historical point of view, this film revolutionized film making. In ""Citizen Kane"", Orson Welles introduced a number of cinematic techniques that had previously never been used in American movies. Prior to ""Citizen Kane"", movies were just seen as little more than filmed stage plays. Orson Welles changed that and because of him film became an artistic medium in its own right. Although, Welles's use of these techniques seems a little clumsy by modern standards, considering that he didn't have decades of movies to refer to, what he did was incredible.The acting in ""Citizen Kane"" is uneven in quality. Orson Welles (who received a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this film) is excellent as Kane, as is Joseph Cotten as Kane's best friend. The film is let down, however, by its supporting actors, in particular Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife. Nevertheless, it is pointed out at the end of the film that the majority of the actors in this film had never appeared in movies before, so to a certain extent, the poor acting can be overlooked. (As an aside, watch out for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance by Alan Ladd as a journalist in the final scene of the film).What lets down ""Citizen Kane"" the most is its script. From the vantage point of the 21st century, ""Citizen Kane""'s Oscar winning script seems slow-moving and is the victim of poor character development. The news reel scene at the start of the film goes on for too long, as does the second half of the film, about Kane's personal life. I would have preferred to see more of his newspaper career. Further, the characters of both of Kane's wives are underdeveloped.Overall, I do not think ""Citizen Kane"" deserves to be called the ""best"" film of all time. There are other better films out there, even films made at about the same time, for example ""Casablanca"", which was made the following year. Nevertheless, I will agree that it is one of the most influential movies of all time, and for that it deserves to be seen.",4,Technically brilliant but...,1199577600,"01 6, 2008",2008,2688,"['very', 'difficult', 'write', 'review', 'film', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'universally', 'accepted', 'being', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'unnecessary', 'write', 'review', 'proclaiming', 'brilliance', 'say', 'anything', 'else', 'sacrilige', 'only', 'way', 'think', 'can', 'be', 'done', 'considering', 'aspect', 'film', 'one', 'time', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'story', 'multi-millionaire', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'told', 'who', 'knew', 'journalist', 'death', 'said', 'be', 'based', 'life', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'who', 'attempted', 'unsuccessfully', 'have', 'film', 'suppressed', 'release.Technically', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'brilliant', 'film', 'historical', 'point', 'view', 'film', 'revolutionized', 'film', 'making', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'introduced', 'number', 'cinematic', 'techniques', 'had', 'previously', 'never', 'been', 'used', 'American', 'movies', 'Prior', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'movies', 'were', 'just', 'seen', 'as', 'little', 'more', 'filmed', 'stage', 'plays', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'changed', 'film', 'became', 'artistic', 'medium', 'own', 'right', 'Welles', 'use', 'techniques', 'little', 'clumsy', 'modern', 'standards', 'considering', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'decades', 'movies', 'refer', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'incredible.The', 'acting', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'uneven', 'quality', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'who', 'received', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'film', 'excellent', 'Kane', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Kane', 'best', 'friend', 'film', 'let', 'down', 'however', 'supporting', 'actors', 'particular', 'Dorothy', 'Comingore', 'Kane', 'second', 'wife', 'Nevertheless', 'pointed', 'out', 'end', 'film', 'majority', 'actors', 'film', 'had', 'never', 'appeared', 'movies', 'so', 'certain', 'extent', 'poor', 'acting', 'can', 'be', 'overlooked', 'aside', 'watch', 'out', ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"", 'appearance', 'Alan', 'Ladd', 'journalist', 'final', 'scene', 'film', 'down', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'most', 'script', 'vantage', 'point', '21st', 'century', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'script', 'slow-moving', 'victim', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'news', 'reel', 'scene', 'start', 'film', 'too', 'long', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'Kane', 'personal', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'see', 'more', 'newspaper', 'career', 'Further', 'characters', 'Kane', 'wives', 'are', 'underdeveloped.Overall', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'be', 'called', 'best', 'film', 'time', 'are', 'other', 'better', 'films', 'there', 'even', 'films', 'made', 'same', 'time', 'example', 'Casablanca', 'was', 'made', 'following', 'year', 'Nevertheless', 'will', 'agree', 'one', 'most', 'influential', 'movies', 'time', 'be', 'seen']",N/A

The disc also contains two feature length audio commentaries, one by Welles friend, confidante, colleague, and biographer Peter Bogdanovich, and the other by Roger Ebert.The Bogdanovich commentary combines directorial insights, many from conversations with Welles, inside perspectives that emanate from Bogdonavich's 18 year association with Welles, mixed with an odd, underlying haughty tone.  Why is not clear to me, but might be related to a certain protectiveness of Welles' legacy.  He is never critical of Welles, and presents him in only the best light as friend and artist.  Both have some experiences in common, although each career arrived at their respective stations for different reasons:  Welles career never recovered from the Hearst blacklist (plus Hollywood's  spite and jealously of the extraordinary contract the RKO gave him with unprecedented artistic freedom without having previously directed a film), and Bogdanovich never recovered from decades of mediocre work after a brilliant start (&quot;Last Picture Show&quot; is a great American film).  However, the content is very interesting, and at times captivating.  Despite my objections, I found his insights illuminating, and certainly added to my enjoyment and appreciation of the film.The Ebert commentary (IMHO) is more disciplined and complete, and essentially similar to Roger's shot-by-shot analyses that he performs at The Virginia Film Festival (this year at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville from October 25-28) and like venues.  The presentation includes vignettes about Welles and the making of the film, plus Ebert's usual mise-en-scene analysis, which is both entertaining, accessible, and instructive.I have always enjoyed Kane, but this pristine print makes viewing the film a nearly new experience.  Because Kane is such a great classic, folks can forget how entertaining it is:  there's something for everyone - drama, noir, irony, slapstick, humor, and even a song and dance number!  Happily, there are two discs:  the first contains the film, the two audio commentaries, and some other features.  The second includes and excellent special (originally aired on PBS) on The Battle Over Citizen Kane which chronicles the war between William Randolph Hearst and Orson Welles.In any case, this is one of the great films, and a must for any collection.",5,Great film;  the best b&amp;w cinematography in film history,1002585600,"10 9, 2001",2001,2617,"['60th', 'anniversary', 'restoration', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'dvd', 'reconstructed', 'best', 'remaining', 'film', 'elements', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'especially', 'breathtaking', 'who', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'seeing', 'film', 'scratchy', 'broken', 'up', 'prints', 'tv', 'disc', 'also', 'two', 'feature', 'length', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'one', 'Welles', 'friend', 'confidante', 'colleague', 'biographer', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'other', 'Roger', 'Ebert.The', 'Bogdanovich', 'commentary', 'combines', 'directorial', 'insights', 'many', 'conversations', 'Welles', 'inside', 'perspectives', 'emanate', 'Bogdonavich', '18', 'year', 'association', 'Welles', 'mixed', 'odd', 'underlying', 'haughty', 'tone', 'Why', 'not', 'clear', 'might', 'be', 'related', 'certain', 'protectiveness', 'Welles', 'legacy', 'never', 'critical', 'Welles', 'only', 'best', 'light', 'friend', 'artist', 'have', 'experiences', 'common', 'career', 'arrived', 'respective', 'stations', 'different', 'reasons', 'Welles', 'career', 'never', 'recovered', 'Hearst', 'blacklist', 'Hollywood', 'spite', 'jealously', 'extraordinary', 'contract', 'RKO', 'gave', 'unprecedented', 'artistic', 'freedom', 'having', 'previously', 'directed', 'film', 'Bogdanovich', 'never', 'recovered', 'decades', 'mediocre', 'work', 'brilliant', 'start', 'quot', 'Last', 'Picture', 'Show', 'quot', 'great', 'American', 'film', 'However', 'content', 'very', 'interesting', 'times', 'captivating', 'objections', 'found', 'insights', 'illuminating', 'certainly', 'added', 'enjoyment', 'appreciation', 'film.The', 'Ebert', 'commentary', 'IMHO', 'more', 'disciplined', 'complete', 'essentially', 'similar', 'Roger', 'shot-by-shot', 'analyses', 'Virginia', 'Film', 'Festival', 'year', 'University', 'Virginia', 'Charlottesville', 'October', '25-28', 'venues', 'presentation', 'vignettes', 'Welles', 'making', 'film', 'Ebert', 'usual', 'mise-en-scene', 'analysis', 'entertaining', 'accessible', 'instructive.I', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'Kane', 'pristine', 'print', 'viewing', 'film', 'nearly', 'new', 'experience', 'Kane', 'such', 'great', 'classic', 'folks', 'can', 'forget', 'how', 'entertaining', 'something', 'everyone', 'drama', 'noir', 'irony', 'slapstick', 'humor', 'even', 'song', 'dance', 'number', 'Happily', 'are', 'two', 'discs', 'first', 'film', 'two', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'other', 'features', 'second', 'excellent', 'special', 'originally', 'aired', 'PBS', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'war', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'Orson', 'Welles.In', 'case', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'must', 'collection']",N/A

297454,A1CIW2OEVAJRM2,6302135621,Godly Gadfly,"[6, 10]","Citizen Kane is regarded as one of the best American movies of all time, if not the best.  After seeing it for the first time, at first I couldn't quite see why.  Sure, it featured innovative technology for its time, but these innovations go largely unnoticed by all except film historians.  And sure, it is clever at times.  And it does seem to bring a powerful message about a man's lust for power and satisfaction in material things, a fruitless quest which ends in emptiness and misery.  I suppose it is brutally honest in showing how a man's idols can fail him, but there is no note of hope or redemption.  But perhaps this is the kind of movie that classifies as art instead of entertainment, and bears the most rewards on multiple viewings.The story-line begins with the death of the wealthy media magnate Charles Foster Kane (modeled somewhat after William Randolph Hearst, who fought to prevent the film from being shown).  Appropriately, it is up to journalists to tell his story, and in their quest to summarize his life, a reporter searches for the significance of his dying word, ""Rosebud"".  The quest is not successful, but this is a clever device to present Kane's life as the fruit of media inquiry, with interviews and flashbacks.  *Spoiler* The final scene does solve the mystery, where it becomes evident that Rosebud is the name of the snow sled from Kane's childhood.  Kane was taken from his mother as a young boy, and entrusted into the custody of a rich industrialist, leaving his family in order to embark on his quest for greatness and power.  This pursuit resulted in the accumulation of many worldly goods, but no happiness.  As others have pointed out, the tragedy of Kane's life illustrates the truth of what the Bible says in Mark 8:36 ""For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?"" On this level ""Citizen Kane"" is a powerful movie with deep symbolism, showing how a man deprived of love from childhood is given money and power, but enters the depths of despair when he finds that it can't buy love or happiness.Certainly this is a message worth hearing, especially in a world where many put their hope in riches and power.  But while ""Citizen Kane"" shows us the emptiness of Kane's life, it offers no alternative.  Like the book of Ecclesiastes, the pursuit of Kane's happiness in earthly things ends only in misery, meaningless, and a vanity of vanities.  But unlike the Bible book, the films concludes with a tragic finale with no sense of hope.  Citizen Kane is brilliant in showing the emptiness of life lived apart from God, but in the end it is a dark movie where the light of the gospel is absent.  It has to be admitted that Kane's life is not a pretty picture, and the tragedy of his life is neither pleasant nor entertaining.  If you're looking for entertainment, don't watch Citizen Kane.  But if you're looking for art with a powerful message and don't mind the absence of a final note of hope, look no further than Citizen Kane. -GODLY GADFLY",4,"Not entertainment, but art; Not pleasurable, but powerful!",1104192000,"12 28, 2004",2004,3025,"['Citizen', 'Kane', 'regarded', 'one', 'best', 'American', 'movies', 'time', 'not', 'best', 'seeing', 'first', 'time', 'first', 'could', ""n't"", 'quite', 'see', 'why', 'Sure', 'featured', 'innovative', 'technology', 'time', 'innovations', 'go', 'largely', 'unnoticed', 'film', 'historians', 'sure', 'clever', 'times', 'seem', 'bring', 'powerful', 'message', 'man', 'lust', 'power', 'satisfaction', 'material', 'things', 'fruitless', 'quest', 'emptiness', 'misery', 'suppose', 'brutally', 'honest', 'showing', 'how', 'man', 'idols', 'can', 'fail', 'note', 'hope', 'redemption', 'perhaps', 'kind', 'movie', 'art', 'instead', 'entertainment', 'most', 'rewards', 'multiple', 'viewings.The', 'story-line', 'death', 'wealthy', 'media', 'magnate', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'modeled', 'somewhat', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'who', 'fought', 'prevent', 'film', 'being', 'shown', 'Appropriately', 'journalists', 'tell', 'story', 'quest', 'summarize', 'life', 'reporter', 'searches', 'significance', 'dying', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'quest', 'not', 'successful', 'clever', 'device', 'present', 'Kane', 'life', 'fruit', 'media', 'inquiry', 'interviews', 'flashbacks', '*Spoiler*', 'final', 'scene', 'solve', 'mystery', 'where', 'evident', 'Rosebud', 'name', 'snow', 'sled', 'Kane', 'childhood', 'Kane', 'was', 'taken', 'mother', 'young', 'boy', 'entrusted', 'custody', 'rich', 'industrialist', 'leaving', 'family', 'order', 'embark', 'quest', 'greatness', 'power', 'pursuit', 'resulted', 'accumulation', 'many', 'worldly', 'goods', 'happiness', 'others', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'tragedy', 'Kane', 'life', 'truth', 'what', 'Bible', 'Mark', '8:36', 'what', 'will', 'profit', 'man', 'gains', 'whole', 'world', 'own', 'soul', 'level', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'powerful', 'movie', 'deep', 'symbolism', 'showing', 'how', 'man', 'deprived', 'love', 'childhood', 'given', 'money', 'power', 'depths', 'despair', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'buy', 'love', 'happiness.Certainly', 'message', 'worth', 'hearing', 'especially', 'world', 'where', 'many', 'put', 'hope', 'riches', 'power', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'emptiness', 'Kane', 'life', 'alternative', 'book', 'Ecclesiastes', 'pursuit', 'Kane', 'happiness', 'earthly', 'things', 'only', 'misery', 'meaningless', 'vanity', 'vanities', 'Bible', 'book', 'films', 'tragic', 'finale', 'sense', 'hope', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'brilliant', 'showing', 'emptiness', 'life', 'lived', 'apart', 'God', 'end', 'dark', 'movie', 'where', 'light', 'gospel', 'absent', 'be', 'admitted', 'Kane', 'life', 'not', 'pretty', 'picture', 'tragedy', 'life', 'pleasant', 'entertaining', ""'re"", 'looking', 'entertainment', 'do', ""n't"", 'watch', 'Citizen', 'Kane', ""'re"", 'looking', 'art', 'powerful', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'absence', 'final', 'note', 'hope', 'look', 'further', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '-GODLY', 'GADFLY']",N/A

This film deserves to be seen not just by film students, but by everyone. What a shame that this film was not a box-office hit upon its initial release in 1941.

One thing about the picture which I found very annoying was the loud blairing circus music when cutting to different scenes.  I wouldn't have rented this movie if I were an MTV junkie.  I appreciate good movies (old and new) but Citizen Kane is not worth buying; rent it instead.One of the qualities of a good movie is that it stays in your mind long after you've seen it.  Citizen Kane doesn't have this lasting effect.  The main character never seems to do any introspection and it was not made clear how he died.  The main character does come to a point in his life where he becomes disillusioned and that (I think) is when he says &quot;Rosebud&quot; then drops the glass ball on the floor.  I have my own theory on what Rosebud meant but I'd rather not spoil the picture.  I'll give you a hint, it's similar to Lester Burham's red pontiac firebird in &quot;American Beauty&quot;.

297470,A16CZRQL23NOIW,6302135621,Hiram Gomez Pardo,"[2, 4]","Charles Foster Kane; welcome to Xanadu the biggest fortress ever built. That opening sequence in which we feel inmediatly the presence of the purest sense of the german expressionism, gives us one of the multiple clues who will give Orson Welles, this legend name in the cinema story.Ths story is told brilliantly for Welles; the way Welles introduces to the world of Kane is through a new who informs us about the death. Warning about this point because Kane will never be telling his life in first person, but through all those knew him in a far or close distance. In this sense Welles, cleverly gives us a huige puzzle that you as viewers must arrange , and thanks to all his countless devices, at the end of the film when you finally discover what Rosebud means , you leave your seat convinced you're a private eye; but rememeber what Welles said once about Rosebud: it just was Freud for one dollar.And this bitter opinion is due the fact that Rosebud means the iodea of something that never reached the complete process of growing up; a flower who never became the best of itself; I mean this point is remarkable because the sense of unfinishness is what Kane means ; nor more either less.In fact Kane is a man who had everything he wanted; except just one thing; his stolen youth and the dreams contained in this unique stage of the life; the world needed just before he reached his twenty years old and made from him a man before the time comes.That's why you can understand his outrageous character; and thanks to The Inquirer he can expand his biological time and in a certain way to try to live his lost years.When he meets to Marian in that funny water accident; he confess her another clue; both of them are surrounded and involved by the loneliness even they are so distant in his respective social status.And all his efforts walk in this direction. Remember by instance, the smart answer pronounced by Kane in a very special inflexion point of the story: &quot;I'm all what you hate&quot; .Kane loves challenging the world, in every little detail; he plays with it and &quot;no matter if he losses one million dollars each year , because he would lose all his fortune in Sixty years&quot;.All his life turns around the sophistication, the greatness and above all to be remembered and loved or hated but never pass away by a sense of indifference. And this is an important issue, because there's a shakesperian mood in this point of view.How can you translate the shakesperian spirit of glory and trascendence into a raising democatric country and also the new raisng empire of the world.That impplies all his outrageousness; the expensive parties; the employement of the deepness of field which lets you watch the secondary planes just beside the first; remeber that dramatic sequence in which Welles and Cotten walk in the newspaper room.The camera works at the floor level; another clever device of Welles; I think he wants to give us the sensation of being in a theatre hall , and in many ways that resource let add much more dramatism to every take.Greg Tolland made an unfirgettable work behind the camera; because this film demands of you that the images through the travellings , dollies and objective use be another actor in this play.The monumentality all along his achievements is obviously a consequence of his character; that justifies the fact of trying Marian be the greates prima voice female in the Opera ; (however; in the deep of his soul and his mind he knows she'll never reach that goal; but once more he's challenging the world)Remember what Oscar Wilde said once:  &quot;The difference between a caprice and a passion who remains all the time of one life; is the caprice remains for a longer time&quot; .This film will be always a must for all the viewers of any age and as well as Bach , Mozart or Beethoven music or the Michelangelo works or Vermeer paintings , due his mythical essence; such its own force for transforming every time you watch them; but the question is Who really transforms: you , the work of both of two?Orson Welles (1915-1985) still continues being a refernce point for many film makers , great or minors ; and to name his contributions would surpass certainly the permitted limit of this review.A film is really good, when the camera is an eye in the mind of a poet, undoubtly a wise sentence of Orson Welles.It's time for all those people who still hadn't watched this movie that literally is a must to make it.A masterpiece in the widest sense of the word.",5,A mythical movie;

Just the movie unless otherwise stated.Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.Excuse me, I was extremely sick while I was watching this movie and I couldn't pay as much attention as I usually could.So anyways, how do I feel it is innovative? Most people say it is for the shots, which, definably it is. For a B&W; film, it's absolutely beautiful. Everything is so craft fully filmed. The moving shots going up and down, just everything is beyond words for the shooting.  It's the work on genius on it's shots, it planted the ultimate apple tree seed for the farmers of tomorrow to eat from and plant more seeds. See my symbolism?And that's another way I think this was extremely innovative, symbolism. This was obviously done before, some of the all time greatest and favorite films before this were King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, The Mummy, Werewolf of London, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Nosferatu, The Phantom of the Opera, Hunchback of Notre Dame (you can see I love horror movies of that time,) but all those wonderful titles of which I have not reviewed on this site all show symoblism in something of fantasy. A giant gorilla, a vampire, a zombie mummy, a werewolf, a shape shifter, a phantom, some of them were real but are outcasts, and thus were not seen very much at the time. Citizen Kane however, delivers the symbolism in a factor of the human perspective. There's also much more of it, in Frankenstein, the whole plot is one point of symbolism, however, this carries out like a book with multiple symbols in addition to that type. I haven't really explained it have I? You would haft to see it for yourself, which I highly recommend.The scripting is very awesome. The idea of doing something, again, so familiar to us, is pure genius. Making it work so well. They didn't just flat out go flat, like some people these days do. But, they really did put the candy on the apple. They were also aware to make sure the candy stayed on the apple and not become it's own candy but to stay with the apple. Am I still symbolic or am I just a maniac? Oh, I haven't even talked about the greatest of things. It's done between two stories, the story of Charles Foster Kane is told through stories from his friends, and a newsreel. At the same time, we try to find out what his dying words ""Rosebud"" mean in the time after his death. So, they tell two stories at once. You pick any masterpiece from well, anytime but especially that time, you will probably not find that innovation. And you never really find out what Rosebud means until the end of the movie, and then, it's still done extremely symbolic and discreet.So, this is extremely innovative. Probably one of the top 10 innovative movies of all time. I'd say, a collection of opinions would say that these movies are the top greatest not in a specific order.

Some say &quot;Godfather&quot;, others &quot;The Matrix&quot; (usually adolescent males), &quot;von Stroheim's &quot;Greed&quot; (my own choice), &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;, etc. Those who like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; tend to be very, very liberal and a bit anti-american (either by being snobs or by being anti-capitalist) as they relish its story of how money and power corrupts, as if money and power can only corrupt Americans (Hello? Has anyone heard of the Medici's?). These fans of the film gleefully point to the film as some kind of indictment of the american dream. It is nothing of the sort. It is the indictment of one man, a fictional character who never existed. Any attempt to condemn the real life Hearst because of the film &quot;Kane&quot; is grossly unfair. For one thing, Heart's mistress, Marion Davies, was a talented comedienne (See the video &quot;Show People&quot;) not the no-talent dummy portrayed in the film. Rather than being a major anti-capitalist statement, the film is simply a very lukewarm melodrama. It is also absurd and just plain silly, also. I won't tell you what &quot;Rosebud&quot; is (so as not to ruin the film for you if you haven't seen it) but it has to be the stupidest plot device and conclusion in film history. Anyone who doesn't finish watching the ending with either hysterics, or a deep sense of resentment that such a build up should have such a major let down needs to have their head examined.

I'd come down on the side of this being an amazingly well-written, engaging movie, myself. Hey, I was one of those skeptics when I first saw Kane, but it's a great story, told in a really winning way, with fantastic acting and a real sense of honesty to everything about it.Even leaving that alone, though -- wow, does this DVD ever understand what makes you want a DVD.First of all, the image transfer is astonishingly clean. If you have an old tape of this movie, you're going to sit up in your chair three or four times and realize you never even saw this or that whole scene before; the images are that much clearer than your bleary old VHS copy. It has that visual zing that you get from really good DVDs.Then there are the extras. You get a whole extra two hours' worth of the American Experience episode, which is extremely satisfying entertainment for anyone who's ever liked a televised biography. (American Experience bios are sometimes breathtakingly good, and this is a superb example.) You get original storyboards for scenes. You get letters from Orson Welles. You get studio memos from the censors. You get production photos. The two soundtracks' worth of commentary are quite different, complementing each other well, and both of them are good fun. (I wish Roger Ebert could stop talking long enough to breathe, or that the sound balance was a little lower [or less consistent] on him during his soundtrack, but he has a lot to offer.)If you're on the fence, Kane is absolutely worth buying in this form. The only DVD I've been quite this impressed by is the Criterion Collection version of The Third Man, for similar reasons: superb restoration; loads of fun extras; and a dazzling, classic, complex and satisfying movie to begin with.",5,Won me over again on DVD,1011225600,"01 17, 2002",2002,1886,"['lot', 'reviews', 'here', 'stew', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'place', 'history', 'watchability', 'people', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'film', 'buffs', ""'d"", 'come', 'down', 'side', 'being', 'amazingly', 'well-written', 'engaging', 'movie', 'Hey', 'was', 'one', 'skeptics', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'Kane', 'great', 'story', 'told', 'really', 'winning', 'way', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'real', 'sense', 'honesty', 'everything', 'it.Even', 'leaving', 'alone', 'though', 'wow', 'DVD', 'ever', 'understand', 'what', 'want', 'DVD.First', 'image', 'transfer', 'astonishingly', 'clean', 'have', 'old', 'tape', 'movie', ""'re"", 'going', 'sit', 'up', 'chair', 'three', 'four', 'times', 'realize', 'never', 'even', 'saw', 'whole', 'scene', 'images', 'are', 'much', 'clearer', 'bleary', 'old', 'VHS', 'copy', 'visual', 'zing', 'get', 'really', 'good', 'DVDs.Then', 'are', 'extras', 'get', 'whole', 'extra', 'two', 'hours', 'worth', 'American', 'Experience', 'episode', 'extremely', 'satisfying', 'entertainment', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'liked', 'televised', 'biography', 'American', 'Experience', 'bios', 'are', 'sometimes', 'breathtakingly', 'good', 'superb', 'example', 'get', 'original', 'storyboards', 'scenes', 'get', 'letters', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'get', 'studio', 'memos', 'censors', 'get', 'production', 'photos', 'two', 'soundtracks', 'worth', 'commentary', 'are', 'quite', 'different', 'complementing', 'other', 'well', 'are', 'good', 'fun', 'wish', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'could', 'stop', 'talking', 'long', 'enough', 'breathe', 'sound', 'balance', 'was', 'little', 'lower', '[', 'consistent', ']', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'offer', ""'re"", 'fence', 'Kane', 'absolutely', 'worth', 'buying', 'form', 'only', 'DVD', ""'ve"", 'been', 'quite', 'impressed', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'version', 'Third', 'Man', 'similar', 'reasons', 'superb', 'restoration', 'loads', 'fun', 'extras', 'dazzling', 'classic', 'complex', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'begin']",N/A

A power and an influence entirely based on newspapers and a new way to practice journalism : journalism as a reality show. Kane has the tendency though to think he can mould the opinions of people as if he controlled them through his papers. The film is a sad demonstration of the impact of such journalism and at the same time its limits and its failures. Actually he is destroyed in his political career by the same papers and journalism that all the other papers immediately imitated because the circulation of Kane&#65533;s papers was menacing the others to be crushed down into oblivion. But the film also explores the personal dimension of the character, his pharaonic ambition, his cult of collecting artistic artefacts or any other collectibles, his love for his second wife and its inevitable end because she could not live up to his dream of being some kind of king or god on earth. She felt abandoned and crushed by the famous palace of Xanadu and finally decided to leave. Strangely enough the film does not emphasize the death of his son, from his first marriage, a death that must have been particularly dramatic to Kane. The film is also a masterpiece by its technique and the way the story is unveiled and developed. It tried all kinds of story-telling techniques, a film in the film, a musical in the film, a jounalistic investigation within the journalistic world of Kane, and a completely exploded plot line that follows the investigation more than chronology. Things come apparently haphazardly though in an absolutely planned way. The structure is not clear cut and onesided, but rather a multifarious and multifacetted structure that gives to the film a tremendous power and dynamism.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Great art without any limits,1016668800,"03 21, 2002",2002,1815,"['film', 'masterpiece', 'last', 'tycoon', 'first', 'half', 'twentieth', 'century', 'power', 'influence', 'entirely', 'based', 'newspapers', 'new', 'way', 'practice', 'journalism', 'journalism', 'reality', 'show', 'Kane', 'tendency', 'think', 'can', 'mould', 'opinions', 'people', 'controlled', 'papers', 'film', 'sad', 'demonstration', 'impact', 'such', 'journalism', 'same', 'time', 'limits', 'failures', 'Actually', 'destroyed', 'political', 'career', 'same', 'papers', 'journalism', 'other', 'papers', 'immediately', 'imitated', 'circulation', 'Kane', '65533', 's', 'papers', 'was', 'menacing', 'others', 'be', 'crushed', 'down', 'oblivion', 'film', 'also', 'personal', 'dimension', 'character', 'pharaonic', 'ambition', 'cult', 'collecting', 'artistic', 'artefacts', 'other', 'collectibles', 'love', 'second', 'wife', 'inevitable', 'end', 'could', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'dream', 'being', 'kind', 'king', 'god', 'earth', 'felt', 'abandoned', 'crushed', 'famous', 'palace', 'Xanadu', 'finally', 'decided', 'leave', 'Strangely', 'film', 'not', 'emphasize', 'death', 'son', 'first', 'marriage', 'death', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'particularly', 'dramatic', 'Kane', 'film', 'also', 'masterpiece', 'technique', 'way', 'story', 'unveiled', 'developed', 'tried', 'kinds', 'story-telling', 'techniques', 'film', 'film', 'musical', 'film', 'jounalistic', 'investigation', 'journalistic', 'world', 'Kane', 'completely', 'exploded', 'plot', 'line', 'investigation', 'more', 'chronology', 'Things', 'come', 'apparently', 'haphazardly', 'absolutely', 'planned', 'way', 'structure', 'not', 'clear', 'cut', 'onesided', 'rather', 'multifarious', 'multifacetted', 'structure', 'film', 'tremendous', 'power', 'dynamism.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",N/A

He has died in his enormous mansion.And now the story begins.For those impatient movie watchers: It is important to see the ""mock"" documentary during the beginning of this film to get the idea how Kane (Orson Welles) became so rich. After a newsreel has been reviewed, they try to investigate why Kane said, ""Rosebud"" on his deathbed.Just who is ""Rosebud"".  Does this ""Rosebud"" inherit a fortune?They begin to interview every imortant person in his life since he became rich to locate ""Rosebud"".  Along the way we discover his miserable childhood.

During the scenes of Kane destroying Susan's room, Orson Welles' hand was really bleeding as his threw himself into motivation. He continued his scenes like a pro.Orson Welles wanted Lucille Ball for the lead, but RKO vetoed it.

People were calling the operators, the police, and emergency because they were upset. People called into CBS Radio not realizing it was only a radio dramatization, not an actual news report.

After all, it is perennially ranked #1 (AFI, Sight & Sound, etc.) and thus there is an *expectation* that it will be one of the best.It might well be other people's favorite film, but I cannot say the same. It was very good, and I will surely watch it again (I've already watched it twice on this nice new DVD). But I can think of several movies I like better, including Casablanca which came out a year later.Funny enough, I see more of a parallel between Charles Foster Kane and Orson Welles (later in life) than I do between Kane and William Randolph Hearst.

Orson Welles's Citizen Kane.  On may be surprised to learn however, that a film long considered on of the greatest films of all time wasn't a hit when it was first released.  In fact, released in 1941, the film was not a cultural marker of its time.  In an era beset with stress and the harsh realizations of reality, the general audience demanded a lighter fare in their movie-going experience.  The musicals of MGM were big at the time, and it wasn't until Welles own The Stranger was released in 1946 that he reached a mass audience.  However well received The Stranger was, Welles despised it, calling it his worst picture ever.Citizen Kane only received lukewarm reception from the public.  The critics immediately hailed Welles as a genius, and the worst reviews rated Citizen Kane as a masterwork of their time.  There was no indication of the fact that almost sixty years after it was made, it would still be hailed as the best movie of all time by the American Film Institute.The question begging to be asked is, ""What makes this film so good?""  I honestly had a lot of trouble reconciling myself to the fact of its greatness.  Like so many objects of art in our time, once something is proclaimed great by a number of people, it has a certain sort of inertia that will not allow people to consciously question its greatness.  I know few people who have worked their way through such dense behemoths of books suck as Tolstoy's Anna Karina or Joyce's Ulysses.  Even with this fact, they remain classics of their languages, and held up as gold standards, which we should only hope to reach.  But I digress.  The problem with our generation is that we don't have the attention span to realize when we are seeing a master storyteller at work.  Many of the methods Welles pioneered have now become so overused that they have fallen in the realm of the clich&eacute;.  The cinematography we see was at the forefront of Film Noire, a genre whose popularity lasted well into its second decade, and whose only defeat was the rise of color in film.  Also seen is the non-linear story line, a device we can see influencing directors as diverse as Francis Ford Coppola and Quentin Tarintino.",5,Citizen Welles,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,2308,"['Rosebud.This', 'perhaps', 'one', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'opening', 'lines', 'film', 'appropriate', 'source', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'may', 'be', 'surprised', 'learn', 'however', 'film', 'long', 'considered', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'hit', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'fact', 'released', '1941', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'cultural', 'marker', 'time', 'era', 'beset', 'stress', 'harsh', 'realizations', 'reality', 'general', 'audience', 'demanded', 'lighter', 'fare', 'movie-going', 'experience', 'musicals', 'MGM', 'were', 'big', 'time', 'was', ""n't"", 'Welles', 'own', 'Stranger', 'was', 'released', '1946', 'reached', 'mass', 'audience', 'However', 'well', 'received', 'Stranger', 'was', 'Welles', 'despised', 'calling', 'worst', 'picture', 'ever.Citizen', 'Kane', 'only', 'received', 'lukewarm', 'reception', 'public', 'critics', 'immediately', 'hailed', 'Welles', 'genius', 'worst', 'reviews', 'rated', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'masterwork', 'time', 'was', 'indication', 'fact', 'almost', 'sixty', 'years', 'was', 'made', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'hailed', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'American', 'Film', 'Institute.The', 'question', 'begging', 'be', 'asked', 'What', 'film', 'so', 'good', 'honestly', 'had', 'lot', 'trouble', 'reconciling', 'fact', 'greatness', 'so', 'many', 'objects', 'art', 'time', 'once', 'something', 'proclaimed', 'great', 'number', 'people', 'certain', 'sort', 'inertia', 'will', 'not', 'allow', 'people', 'consciously', 'question', 'greatness', 'know', 'few', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'worked', 'way', 'such', 'dense', 'behemoths', 'books', 'suck', 'Tolstoy', 'Anna', 'Karina', 'Joyce', 'Ulysses', 'Even', 'fact', 'remain', 'classics', 'languages', 'held', 'up', 'gold', 'standards', 'should', 'only', 'hope', 'reach', 'digress', 'problem', 'generation', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'realize', 'when', 'are', 'seeing', 'master', 'storyteller', 'work', 'Many', 'methods', 'Welles', 'pioneered', 'have', 'now', 'become', 'so', 'overused', 'have', 'fallen', 'realm', 'clich', 'eacute', 'cinematography', 'see', 'was', 'forefront', 'Film', 'Noire', 'genre', 'popularity', 'lasted', 'well', 'second', 'decade', 'only', 'defeat', 'was', 'rise', 'color', 'film', 'Also', 'seen', 'non-linear', 'story', 'line', 'device', 'can', 'see', 'influencing', 'directors', 'as', 'diverse', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'Quentin', 'Tarintino']",N/A

297496,A3NKFB39AIEN8W,6302135621,J. O. Booker,"[1, 4]","First, let me get one thing out of the way: Citizen Kane is not the greatest movie ever made. It is the safest choice for the best movie ever made based on who you're trying to kiss up to. The way the critics gush about this movie, you'd think Citizen Kane invented cinematography, nuance, good storytelling, etc. Whoever says that this movie is the greatest movie of all time has only seen fifteen movies. Check out Children Of Paradise, Scenes From a Marriage, Au hassard Balthasar, The Red Shoes, Rashoman, La Dolce Vita, The 400 Blows, The Battle of Algiers, Metropolis, Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Making of Citizen Kane, etc, etc, etc. There are thousands of films that can make a strong case for being the greatest film ever made, so I'll just focus on the merits of Citizen Kane.First, Citizen Kane is loosely based on the life of Newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst and his rise to the top of the newspaper business. The story is told in a series of flashbacks that are each narrated by an old acquaintance whose account cannot--for various reasons including inebriation and dementia--be completely trusted. However, all of their accounts of Kane's life share a common thread: Kane was incomplete. Everything he bought was a substitute for Rosebud and his stolen childhood, which became fuel for his obsession for power and the love of the public through his newspapers.Orson Wells played both Kane and himself--a powerful and talented prodigy who had no sense of his own limitations. And, indeed, at the tender of of only twenty-four years of age, Welles had absolutely every reason to fall on his face. He didn't, he couldn't--not after securing the most lucrative motion picture contract in the history of motion pictures (for his time). William Hearst tried to destroy the film, to keep the world from seeing Citizen Kane; however, the film survived both Welles and Hearst, and lives on for the ages as a proverb: no matter how far you travel, you can never escape who you truly are. The technical achievements of this film are legendary. Believe it or not, the second disc, the Battle Over Citizen Kane, is actually better than the film itself. A film that is well worth the hype, though not the title of greatest film ever.

297500,A72A8JDQK4D8S,6302135621,John A. Lind,"[4, 6]","This review is about the 70th Anniversary Blu-ray version (with book). The restoration and transfer to Blu-ray is quite excellent, especially given the age of the B&W; film used from the archives. I found nothing objectionable with the gray scale, highlights or deep shadow. The audio is what it is -- good -- given the era in which the film was made. No objectionable extraneous clicks, pops or (especially) hiss. Don't expect the kind of high fidelity that current films have though -- ability to record that didn't exist when this film was made.Don't underestimate the enormous power William Randolph Hearst had, even after the Great Depression had put a major dent in his news media empire, just before U.S. entry into WWII when this film was released. Hearst considered this film a personal affront and did everything he could to kill it ""with extreme prejudice."" It would have likely swept the Oscars had Hearst not launched an all-out attack on Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, severely damaging Welles' career permanently. Hearst tried first to kill the film before it ever saw the light of day. This included an offer to pay the studio, essentially a bribe, to not release it and destroy all the film's negatives and prints. Failing that, he then then limited theaters in which it showed by threatening to *permanently* refuse advertising in any of his newspapers for *any* theater that showed it. As a result, Citizen Kane did not open in New York in the theater it normally would have (the one the studio used for major film releases). For the Academy Awards, he heavily influenced Guild members as he controlled printed reviews of films, directors and actors.""Citizen Kane"" is groundbreaking in its screenplay by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (the older of the two Mankiewicz brothers), and in Toland's cinematography for which he and Welles had to invent equipment and create methods to achieve -- influencing many films, writers, cinematographers and directors that have followed. The story itself -- about the rise and fall of a very powerful megalomaniac's newspaper and radio station empire, that by self-proclamation allegedly fought for the rights of the ""Little Guy"" -- is compelling and the manner in which it's told on film is powerful. These are the reasons Citizen Kane has endured at the very top of the lists of all-time greatest feature films ever made . . . in spite of all Hearst's efforts to quash it.",5,70th Anniversary Blu-ray -- Excellent Blu-ray Transfer -- Superb Groundbreaking Film,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,2428,"['review', '70th', 'Anniversary', 'Blu-ray', 'version', 'book', 'restoration', 'transfer', 'Blu-ray', 'quite', 'excellent', 'especially', 'given', 'age', 'B', 'W', 'film', 'used', 'archives', 'found', 'nothing', 'objectionable', 'gray', 'scale', 'highlights', 'deep', 'shadow', 'audio', 'what', 'good', 'given', 'era', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'objectionable', 'extraneous', 'clicks', 'pops', 'especially', 'hiss', 'Do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'kind', 'high', 'fidelity', 'current', 'films', 'have', 'though', 'ability', 'record', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'made.Do', ""n't"", 'underestimate', 'enormous', 'power', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'had', 'even', 'Great', 'Depression', 'had', 'put', 'major', 'dent', 'news', 'media', 'empire', 'just', 'U.S.', 'entry', 'WWII', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'Hearst', 'considered', 'film', 'personal', 'affront', 'did', 'everything', 'could', 'kill', 'extreme', 'prejudice', 'would', 'have', 'likely', 'swept', 'Oscars', 'had', 'Hearst', 'not', 'launched', 'all-out', 'attack', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'severely', 'damaging', 'Welles', 'career', 'permanently', 'Hearst', 'tried', 'first', 'kill', 'film', 'ever', 'saw', 'light', 'day', 'included', 'offer', 'pay', 'studio', 'essentially', 'bribe', 'not', 'release', 'destroy', 'film', 'negatives', 'prints', 'Failing', 'then', 'then', 'limited', 'theaters', 'showed', 'threatening', '*permanently*', 'refuse', 'advertising', 'newspapers', '*any*', 'theater', 'showed', 'result', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'did', 'not', 'open', 'New', 'York', 'theater', 'normally', 'would', 'have', 'one', 'studio', 'used', 'major', 'film', 'releases', 'Academy', 'Awards', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'Guild', 'members', 'controlled', 'printed', 'reviews', 'films', 'directors', 'actors', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'groundbreaking', 'screenplay', 'Welles', 'Herman', 'Mankiewicz', 'older', 'two', 'Mankiewicz', 'brothers', 'Toland', 'cinematography', 'Welles', 'had', 'invent', 'equipment', 'create', 'methods', 'achieve', 'influencing', 'many', 'films', 'writers', 'cinematographers', 'directors', 'have', 'followed', 'story', 'rise', 'fall', 'very', 'powerful', 'megalomaniac', 'newspaper', 'radio', 'station', 'empire', 'self-proclamation', 'allegedly', 'fought', 'rights', 'Little', 'Guy', 'compelling', 'manner', 'told', 'film', 'powerful', 'are', 'reasons', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'endured', 'very', 'top', 'lists', 'all-time', 'greatest', 'feature', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'spite', 'Hearst', 'efforts', 'quash']",N/A

The scope and vision that it took to make such a movie as this is amazing to me, to say the very, very least. If you are a serious film student, or interested in the history of American film, then this is a must see for you.Those who contend that this film is nothing more than self glorification of hollywood and it's many characters have either a) missed the point or b)failed to appreciate it.In the former case, I think that the individuals who criticize it without understanding it are looking at it through modern day spectacle eyes, trying to see it as something that is supposed to be entertaining and have a point. The 'point' is simply that our own lives seem so complicated and big, but break down to a few moments that we hang on to forever, maybe without anyone else even knowing. That is what life is. Other movies try to glorify life or make it something that it is not...why do you think they have the line 'I always wanted to say this...', it's because in real life you can't...real life is dishes and bills. That what citizen kane struck me as, dishes and bills. Truth.The later group is the noveau cliche type, those who think that art is some underground thing that only they and a few others know about. Bad news for you folks is this: there were a lot more renaisance painters than leonardo, but he survived because so many liked and appreciated his works. Others claimed that there were other artists who had a better scope or understood 'art for art' better than that master...question is, where are they now? If your vision of art is so much better than the masses, then why isn't it in the masses? That is my answer to those reviewers look at this movie; that this (movie) is the type of art that reflects the culture it came from, that will survive as a reflection of that culture. There are hundreds of others, true, but they failed on the simple basis of broad blanketing of social capture. My personal favorite is Pygmalion, but I'm no fool to think it will be shown in history classes years from now as explanation of our times.In short...see this film, love or hate, ignore or appreciate it...it will be there as testament no matter what your opinion.",5,Oh brother...,1039910400,"12 15, 2002",2002,2253,"['think', 'probably', 'one', 'greatest', 'movies', 'time', 'scope', 'vision', 'took', 'make', 'such', 'movie', 'amazing', 'say', 'very', 'very', 'least', 'are', 'serious', 'film', 'student', 'interested', 'history', 'American', 'film', 'then', 'must', 'see', 'you.Those', 'who', 'contend', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'self', 'glorification', 'hollywood', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'missed', 'point', 'b', 'failed', 'appreciate', 'it.In', 'former', 'case', 'think', 'individuals', 'who', 'criticize', 'understanding', 'are', 'looking', 'modern', 'day', 'spectacle', 'eyes', 'trying', 'see', 'something', 'supposed', 'be', 'entertaining', 'have', 'point', ""'point"", 'simply', 'own', 'lives', 'seem', 'so', 'complicated', 'big', 'break', 'down', 'few', 'moments', 'hang', 'forever', 'maybe', 'anyone', 'else', 'even', 'knowing', 'what', 'life', 'Other', 'movies', 'try', 'glorify', 'life', 'make', 'something', 'not', 'why', 'do', 'think', 'have', 'line', 'always', 'wanted', 'say', 'real', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'real', 'life', 'dishes', 'bills', 'what', 'citizen', 'kane', 'struck', 'dishes', 'bills', 'Truth.The', 'later', 'group', 'noveau', 'cliche', 'type', 'who', 'think', 'art', 'underground', 'thing', 'only', 'few', 'others', 'know', 'Bad', 'news', 'folks', 'were', 'lot', 'more', 'renaisance', 'painters', 'leonardo', 'survived', 'because', 'so', 'many', 'liked', 'appreciated', 'works', 'Others', 'claimed', 'were', 'other', 'artists', 'who', 'had', 'better', 'scope', 'understood', ""'art"", 'art', 'better', 'master', 'question', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'vision', 'art', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'masses', 'then', 'why', ""n't"", 'masses', 'answer', 'reviewers', 'look', 'movie', 'movie', 'type', 'art', 'culture', 'came', 'will', 'survive', 'reflection', 'culture', 'are', 'hundreds', 'others', 'true', 'failed', 'simple', 'basis', 'broad', 'blanketing', 'social', 'capture', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Pygmalion', ""'m"", 'fool', 'think', 'will', 'be', 'shown', 'history', 'classes', 'years', 'now', 'explanation', 'times.In', 'short', 'see', 'film', 'love', 'hate', 'ignore', 'appreciate', 'will', 'be', 'there', 'testament', 'matter', 'what', 'opinion']",N/A

See it for Gregg Toland's lovely, pathbreaking deep-focus photography, Herman Mankiewicz's witty dialogue, and Welles's legendary performance as the enigmatic Kane.

Two commentary tracks, the first is by Peter Bogdanovich who was a close friend with Orson Welles during the last 20 years of his life, and also the author of a book long interview with the master director.  Bogdanovich provides a great amount of insight during the film.  He explains a lot of background into Welles thinking.  The second commentary by Roger Ebert is equally worthwhile.  Ebert spends his time talking about the production aspects of the film.  He explains the lighting and the use of ceilings and the way one-shot scenes and deep focus make the movie a technical miracle.Besides all of that, you also get a 2-hour documentary on the making of the film and the controversy that surrounded it.  The Battle over Citizen Kane is actually an episode of the PBS show American Experience.  Well Done.  The original movie trailer is also a blast, as it gives away absolutely nothing about the film.

Unfortunately, Amazon limits reviews to a thousand words only so I'll have to be brief but no amount of words can do justice to &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;I can't, and therefore won't, pretend to be &quot;objective&quot; about this film.  As the great Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci once said, &quot;Objectivity does not exist - it cannot exist ... The word is a hypocrisy which is sustained by the lie that the truth stays in the middle. No, sir: sometimes truth stays on one side only.&quot;In the case of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the truth is on one side only: it is a truly great film and deserves to be ranked as one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film, ever made. And anyone who says otherwise is not only wrong but grossly ignorant of this film, the history of film, and its place in the history of film.A few key highlights on &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;First, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is a work of art. (Yeah, I know that is a cliche, but like most cliches, it's true).  Most movies are merely entertaining because that is all they are meant to be and do. &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; tried to be more and do more and succeeded.Second, Orson was a genius and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was his masterpiece.Third, its screenplay is itself a masterpiece. Just as matter of fact, the actual shooting script was based on two scripts (written separately by Welles and Mankiewicz) that Welles combined into one for the final version. By the way, best screenplay was the only category that garnered an Academy Award for &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot;  By rights, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; should have won all the categories but did not because of the efforts of William Randolph Hearst (incredibly, the real Hearst was even worse than the man &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; portrayed!).Third, the look (and sound) of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is glorious. Gregg Toland was one of the greatest cinematographers in the history of film, period, and &quot;Kane&quot; proves it. Without going into the boring (actually not boring) technical details, this film was ahead of its time and used many techniques for the first time that we have long since gotten used to. Unfortunately, we have forgotten where they came from.Welles and his cinematographer Gregg Toland developed or enhanced techniques for allowing the drama to develop on multiple planes of vision and sound. the film's deep focus photography, which allows actors and objects to remain in focus whatever their distance from the camera, allowed multiple actions to be shown within a single frame and remain comprehensible, allowing for complex interactions between foreground and background.Welles and John Aalberg created a complex soundtrack that merged multiple dialogues, sometimes spoken simultaneously, and music into a comprehensible whole.Fourth, Bernard Herrmann. Do I need to say anything more? Although Bernard Herrmann received an Academy Award nomination for his score for &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; he actually won the award that year for his music for ALL THAT MONEY CAN BUY.Fifth, the film editing was fantastic. Kudos to Robert Wise.Sixth, the extraordinary cast of actors were drawn entirely from the famed Mercury Theatre troupe, which Orson Welles founded when he was only 21 years old.Seventh, It was directed by Orson Welles.Eighth, It was produced by Orson Welles.Ninth, Charles Foster Kane was portrayed by Orson Welles.Tenth, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was made by Orson Welles. Did I mention that he shared the credit for best original screenplay?I think there is a pattern here.Bottom Line: If &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is not already in your DVD collection, get the two-disc set, you won't regret it.",5,Words cannot do justice to Citizen Kane,1083024000,"04 27, 2004",2004,3762,"['picture', 'thousand', 'words', 'then', 'motion', 'picture', 'million', 'words', 'Unfortunately', 'Amazon', 'reviews', 'thousand', 'words', 'only', 'so', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'brief', 'amount', 'words', 'can', 'do', 'justice', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane.', 'quot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'therefore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pretend', 'be', 'quot', 'objective', 'quot', 'film', 'great', 'Italian', 'journalist', 'Oriana', 'Fallaci', 'once', 'said', 'quot', 'Objectivity', 'not', 'exist', 'can', 'not', 'exist', 'word', 'hypocrisy', 'sustained', 'lie', 'truth', 'middle', 'No', 'sir', 'sometimes', 'truth', 'stays', 'one', 'side', 'only.', 'quot', 'case', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'truth', 'one', 'side', 'only', 'truly', 'great', 'film', 'be', 'ranked', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'not', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'anyone', 'who', 'otherwise', 'not', 'only', 'wrong', 'grossly', 'ignorant', 'film', 'history', 'film', 'place', 'history', 'film.A', 'few', 'key', 'highlights', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane.', 'quot', 'First', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'work', 'art', 'Yeah', 'know', 'cliche', 'most', 'cliches', 'true', 'Most', 'movies', 'are', 'merely', 'entertaining', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'do', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'tried', 'be', 'more', 'do', 'more', 'succeeded.Second', 'Orson', 'was', 'genius', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'was', 'masterpiece.Third', 'screenplay', 'masterpiece', 'Just', 'matter', 'fact', 'actual', 'shooting', 'script', 'was', 'based', 'two', 'scripts', 'written', 'separately', 'Welles', 'Mankiewicz', 'Welles', 'combined', 'one', 'final', 'version', 'way', 'best', 'screenplay', 'was', 'only', 'category', 'garnered', 'Academy', 'Award', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane.', 'quot', 'rights', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'should', 'have', 'won', 'categories', 'did', 'not', 'efforts', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'incredibly', 'real', 'Hearst', 'was', 'even', 'worse', 'man', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', '.Third', 'look', 'sound', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'glorious', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'was', 'one', 'greatest', 'cinematographers', 'history', 'film', 'period', 'quot', 'Kane', 'quot', 'going', 'boring', 'actually', 'not', 'boring', 'technical', 'details', 'film', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'used', 'many', 'techniques', 'first', 'time', 'have', 'long', 'gotten', 'used', 'Unfortunately', 'have', 'forgotten', 'where', 'came', 'from.Welles', 'cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'developed', 'enhanced', 'techniques', 'allowing', 'drama', 'develop', 'multiple', 'planes', 'vision', 'sound', 'film', 'deep', 'focus', 'photography', 'actors', 'objects', 'remain', 'focus', 'distance', 'camera', 'allowed', 'multiple', 'actions', 'be', 'shown', 'single', 'frame', 'remain', 'comprehensible', 'allowing', 'complex', 'interactions', 'foreground', 'background.Welles', 'John', 'Aalberg', 'created', 'complex', 'soundtrack', 'merged', 'multiple', 'dialogues', 'sometimes', 'spoken', 'simultaneously', 'music', 'comprehensible', 'whole.Fourth', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'Do', 'need', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'received', 'Academy', 'Award', 'nomination', 'score', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'actually', 'won', 'award', 'year', 'music', 'MONEY', 'CAN', 'BUY.Fifth', 'film', 'editing', 'was', 'fantastic', 'Kudos', 'Robert', 'Wise.Sixth', 'extraordinary', 'cast', 'actors', 'were', 'drawn', 'entirely', 'famed', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'troupe', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'founded', 'when', 'was', 'only', '21', 'years', 'old.Seventh', 'was', 'directed', 'Orson', 'Welles.Eighth', 'was', 'produced', 'Orson', 'Welles.Ninth', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'was', 'portrayed', 'Orson', 'Welles.Tenth', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'was', 'made', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Did', 'mention', 'shared', 'credit', 'best', 'original', 'screenplay', 'think', 'pattern', 'here.Bottom', 'Line', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'not', 'already', 'DVD', 'collection', 'get', 'two-disc', 'set', 'wo', ""n't"", 'regret']",N/A

Sturdy packaging, and with same content as 60th dvd. Alas, I am going to upset folks, but perhaps some will be thankful to save some green. (Here goes:) On 50"" 720p tv, I compared versions, scene by assorted scene. I believe the dvd has just as much picture clarity/detail as the blu. It is, however, a much brighter (harsher?) picture to view than the blu, which has a warmer, almost 'sepia' quality. In many scenes, the picture was 'grainier' (even light through windows) on the blu, while the dvd had a more polished or sterile look (that also adds to background clarity, like pictures on a wall). Purists likely prefer the 'grain', but is it even certain what Welles and Toland intended for their medium? Funny, but as I was 'wearing out' my tv's input button, I occasionally lost track of which version I was viewing, such is the quality of both.

Just go ahead and put it in your shopping cart.This review is for those of you who do not know about this film, and are maybe even wondering why you should care. Why do so many film critics lavish so much praise on a film made so long ago?One reason is the director and star of the film, Orson Welles. Already considered to be a genius at a young age, Welles stormed Hollywood at age 25 with the clout of a man three times his age. With that power, he made a movie that defied typical storytelling techniques, invented cinematic tricks on the fly, and successfully pulled off filming an unflattering, near bio-pic of the nation's most powerful newspaper publisher, William Randolph Hearst.The kind of &quot;carte-blanche&quot; given to Orson Welles at the time, was unprecedented, but now, it's unthinkable. That makes this film all the more mezmerizing because it's a fantastic film.It centers around Charles Foster Kane, a larger-than-life man without the fear that stops lesser men from achieving greatness. But Kane's life is not all great, and in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards, we see how Charles Foster Kane was both tender and loving, but ruthless and selfish just the same.This is a film of immense importance in American cinema. It was Orson Welles' greatest acheivement, yet the beginning of his downfall. After all, who could possibly top a movie as good as &quot;Citizen Kane?&quot; Welles discovered that it was impossible to even try.This is an important film for fans of movies, film historians, people interested in the William Randolph Hearst connection, and in the sheer drama of filmmaking. There has never been a movie like it, and there never will be. It is a film that will surprise you, no matter how many times you watch it.Once again, if you have not seen it, make &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; your VERY NEXT DVD purchase. You owe it to yourself as a movie fan.",5,What Were YOU Doing at the Age of 25?

297533,AO461REE0KA4J,6302135621,keviny01,"[5, 6]","The gorgeous new transfer of CITIZEN KANE on this DVD is much improved over that for the Criterion laserdisc version in 1991.  The picture is much cleaner; scratches, splices, and other blemishes have been cleaned up considerably.  Details in darker areas are much clearer.  For instance, in the scene where Charlie writes his declaration of principles while his head is in a shadow, on all previous transfers of the film that I saw, his head is in near total darkness; but on this DVD, his facial features are still clearly visible.  Another example is the scene where Charlie orders Susan to continue singing and his shadow totally engulfs her face.  On this DVD, you can distinctly see her facial expression in the shadow, while on older transfers, you cannot.  The improved details within shadows are crucial since much of Greg Toland's innovative photography makes elaborate uses of light and shadows -- shadows that are not just invisible black spaces, but with details, textures, and significance just like lit spaces.  Observant viewers will also notice on the improved DVD picture that, during the projection room scene, one of the people in the shadow is Joseph Cotten.  He is barely noticeable on old transfers, but very much so on this DVD.  (CITIZEN KANE is a rare film in which the actor who plays a main character also plays a cameo role in it!)  Also welcomed is that certain frames in the movie are displayed in &quot;windowboxed&quot; format (such as the huge headline &quot;Kane Marries 'Singer'&quot;), ensuring that they can seen in full on certain monitors.The audio transfer has not been neglected.  The mono sound is clear, sharp, and smooth.  Loud sounds are bright but not harsh.  Soft sounds are always audible.  The softest sound in the movie is probably the moment when Charlie says to Bernstein, &quot;Close the door,&quot; right after Susan's opera debut.  On old transfers it is barely audible, but much more so on this DVD.There are 2 audio commentaries, one by Roger Ebert, who has done many shot-by-shot analyses of CITIZEN KANE and has deep knowledge about the film, and another one by Peter Bogdanovich, who knew Orson Welles personally and has deep knowledge about Welles's life and career.  Ebert's narration is livelier and covers more grounds.  He analyzes some of the themes in the story, and explains many innovative techniques used by the filmmakers, emphasizing that KANE is largely a &quot;special-effects&quot; picture.  Bogdanovich speaks subduedly and sparingly throughout (at one point he says there are other Welles pictures he likes more than KANE), but he makes many keen observations about Welles that can only come from someone who knew him well.  He says he once asked Welles why he did things so differently from other filmmakers.  Welles replied, &quot;I was like the guy who felt sick, and the doctor asked him what he did very morning.  And he said, &quot;Every morning I get up, then vomit...&quot;.  The doctor asked, &quot;You VOMIT every morning?&quot;  And the guy said, &quot;Doesn't EVERYONE?&quot;  The guy thought what he did was normal.  And so did I.&quot;Other extras on the DVD include a one-minute newsreel footage of the film's New York premiere, the wonderfully-edited original theatrical trailer, and about 100 stills from the film's storyboards, production photos, press kit, and posters.  In the &quot;Still Gallery&quot; section, Roger Ebert speaks again on an 11-minute audio track about the significance of Welles' achievements in KANE.  There are two &quot;easter eggs&quot; (undocumented features) on the DVD as well.  One is on the main menu -- select the &quot;sled&quot; symbol and you will see a 6-minute interview of Ruth Warrick, who recalls her experience working with Welles.  Another &quot;sled&quot; symbol can be found in the &quot;Production Notes -- On the Set&quot; section where Robert Wise is mentioned.  Selecting it will take you to a 3-minute interview of Wise, who recounts a few anecdotes about KANE.The second disc contains the excellent 2-hour documentary THE BATTLE OVER CITIZEN KANE, from 1996.  The disc is identical in content to an earlier DVD released by WGBH Boston Video.  The documentary provides vivid portrayals of Hearst and Welles, detail accounts of their rise to power, and fascinating details about the making of KANE and, of course, Hearst's attempts to destroy it.  The makers of the documentary went on to make the equally brilliant HBO movie RKO 281.",5,It's Terrific!!,1001808000,"09 30, 2001",2001,4477,"['gorgeous', 'new', 'transfer', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'DVD', 'much', 'improved', 'over', 'Criterion', 'laserdisc', 'version', '1991', 'picture', 'much', 'cleaner', 'scratches', 'splices', 'other', 'blemishes', 'have', 'been', 'cleaned', 'up', 'considerably', 'Details', 'darker', 'areas', 'are', 'much', 'clearer', 'instance', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlie', 'declaration', 'principles', 'head', 'shadow', 'previous', 'transfers', 'film', 'saw', 'head', 'near', 'total', 'darkness', 'DVD', 'facial', 'features', 'are', 'still', 'clearly', 'visible', 'example', 'scene', 'where', 'Charlie', 'orders', 'Susan', 'continue', 'singing', 'shadow', 'totally', 'face', 'DVD', 'can', 'distinctly', 'see', 'facial', 'expression', 'shadow', 'older', 'transfers', 'can', 'not', 'improved', 'details', 'shadows', 'are', 'crucial', 'much', 'Greg', 'Toland', 'innovative', 'photography', 'elaborate', 'uses', 'light', 'shadows', 'are', 'not', 'just', 'invisible', 'black', 'spaces', 'details', 'textures', 'significance', 'just', 'lit', 'spaces', 'Observant', 'viewers', 'will', 'also', 'notice', 'improved', 'DVD', 'picture', 'projection', 'room', 'scene', 'one', 'people', 'shadow', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'barely', 'noticeable', 'old', 'transfers', 'very', 'much', 'so', 'DVD', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'rare', 'film', 'actor', 'who', 'main', 'character', 'also', 'cameo', 'role', 'Also', 'welcomed', 'certain', 'frames', 'movie', 'are', 'displayed', 'quot', 'quot', 'such', 'huge', 'headline', 'quot', 'Kane', 'Marries', ""'Singer"", 'quot', 'ensuring', 'can', 'seen', 'full', 'certain', 'monitors.The', 'audio', 'transfer', 'not', 'been', 'neglected', 'mono', 'sound', 'clear', 'sharp', 'smooth', 'Loud', 'sounds', 'are', 'bright', 'not', 'harsh', 'Soft', 'sounds', 'are', 'always', 'audible', 'softest', 'sound', 'movie', 'probably', 'moment', 'when', 'Charlie', 'Bernstein', 'quot', 'Close', 'door', 'quot', 'right', 'Susan', 'opera', 'debut', 'old', 'transfers', 'barely', 'audible', 'much', 'more', 'so', 'DVD.There', 'are', '2', 'audio', 'commentaries', 'one', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'who', 'done', 'many', 'shot-by-shot', 'analyses', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'deep', 'knowledge', 'film', 'one', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'who', 'knew', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'personally', 'deep', 'knowledge', 'Welles', 'life', 'career', 'Ebert', 'narration', 'livelier', 'more', 'grounds', 'themes', 'story', 'many', 'innovative', 'techniques', 'used', 'filmmakers', 'emphasizing', 'KANE', 'largely', 'quot', 'special-effects', 'quot', 'picture', 'Bogdanovich', 'subduedly', 'sparingly', 'one', 'point', 'are', 'other', 'Welles', 'more', 'KANE', 'many', 'keen', 'observations', 'Welles', 'can', 'only', 'come', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'well', 'once', 'asked', 'Welles', 'why', 'did', 'things', 'so', 'differently', 'other', 'filmmakers', 'Welles', 'replied', 'quot', 'was', 'guy', 'who', 'felt', 'sick', 'doctor', 'asked', 'what', 'did', 'very', 'morning', 'said', 'quot', 'Every', 'morning', 'get', 'up', 'then', 'vomit', 'quot', 'doctor', 'asked', 'quot', 'VOMIT', 'morning', 'quot', 'guy', 'said', 'quot', ""n't"", 'EVERYONE', 'quot', 'guy', 'thought', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'normal', 'so', 'did', 'I.', 'quot', 'Other', 'extras', 'DVD', 'include', 'one-minute', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'film', 'New', 'York', 'premiere', 'wonderfully-edited', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', '100', 'stills', 'film', 'storyboards', 'production', 'photos', 'press', 'kit', 'posters', 'quot', 'Still', 'Gallery', 'quot', 'section', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'again', '11-minute', 'audio', 'track', 'significance', 'Welles', 'achievements', 'KANE', 'are', 'two', 'quot', 'eggs', 'quot', 'undocumented', 'features', 'DVD', 'as', 'well', 'One', 'main', 'menu', 'select', 'quot', 'sled', 'quot', 'symbol', 'will', 'see', '6-minute', 'interview', 'Ruth', 'Warrick', 'who', 'experience', 'working', 'Welles', 'quot', 'sled', 'quot', 'symbol', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'quot', 'Production', 'Notes', 'Set', 'quot', 'section', 'where', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'mentioned', 'Selecting', 'will', 'take', '3-minute', 'interview', 'Wise', 'who', 'few', 'anecdotes', 'KANE.The', 'second', 'disc', 'excellent', '2-hour', 'documentary', 'THE', 'BATTLE', 'OVER', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', '1996', 'disc', 'identical', 'content', 'earlier', 'DVD', 'released', 'WGBH', 'Boston', 'Video', 'documentary', 'vivid', 'portrayals', 'Hearst', 'Welles', 'detail', 'accounts', 'rise', 'power', 'fascinating', 'details', 'making', 'KANE', 'course', 'Hearst', 'attempts', 'destroy', 'makers', 'documentary', 'went', 'make', 'equally', 'brilliant', 'HBO', 'movie', 'RKO', '281']",N/A

297537,A2Q07KQAAFWVL7,6302135621,Kristoffer Infante,"[1, 3]","Yes, it's true. CITIZEN KANE, like so many people have said countless times before, is my own inspiration to filmmaking; acting, directing, writing and producing my own future Oscar-winning epic masterpieces - PRISONER OF WAR, PRISONER OF WAR: PART II, PHILIP, KING OF SPAIN, and TRIANGLE. Although, I should say that CITIZEN KANE is one of many films that have inspired me, others include David Lean's trifecta of THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, and DOCTOR ZHIVAGO; GONE WITH THE WIND, SCHINDLER'S LIST, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, THE LAST EMPEROR, and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. And, to a very lesser extent, I'll even say TITANIC and, maybe (though I hope not), the upcoming PEARL HARBOR. Though PRISONER OF WAR will be much more heartbreaking and moving without being melodramatic than either TITANIC and PEARL HARBOR! (Yes, there are a lot of impressionable films!) And soon, so will my films be legendary, critically-acclaimed, Oscar-winning, box-office smash-hit, epic classics.Wow, that's a mouth full!Back to CITIZEN KANE, a very inspirational film due to its groundbreaking techniques in camera angles (cinematography), dialogue, subject matter, shadows and lighting, and acting.In 1941, Orson Welles, 26-years-old at the time, was given permission by RKO Radio to produce a film of his choosing. He decided to write a scandalous story loosely based on the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, actress Marion Davies. Controversial at the time because of the backlash that the film and Welles received when word got to Hearst of this picture depicting his life. Hearst tried many ways to get this film from ever being shown: He tried to buy the negatives from RKO in order to burn them; he tried to slam the film in all his newspaper, and even had Louella Parsons, a powerful critic at the time, slam the film in her columns. For more on this story, check out the 1999 film &quot;RKO 281.&quot;Welles, along with Herman Mankiewicz (brother of Oscar-winning director Joseph L. Mankiewicz), both collaborated in writing the script. Welles, who starred as the &quot;hero&quot; Charles Foster Kane, also acted as the director and producer, bringing in his Mercury Theater stage troupe from New York to fill in the parts for his film. They were: Joseph Cotten, as Kane's friend Jedediah Leland, the newspaper's drama critic; Everett Sloane as Kane's nerdy assistant, Mr. Bernstein; Agnes Moorehead, as Kane's mother Mrs. Mary Kane; Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander Kane; Ruth Warrick as Kane's first wife, Emily Norton Kane; Ray Collins as Kane's rival in politics, &quot;Boss&quot; Jim W. Gettys; Erskine Sanford as the befuddled Herbert Carter; Paul Stewart as Raymond the butler; and George Coulouris as Walter Parks Thatcher, the man who takes little Charlie from his mother and father, played by Harry Shannon.It begins with the death of Charles Foster Kane with his final words &quot;Rosebud.&quot; This meaning is the basis for the film, as a mystery, film-noir, and as a character study with little bits of comedy in it (supplied by Erskine Sanford's character). The film is basically told in flashback, going from his childhood in 1878 to his death in 1941. Revered as America's own Kublai Khan, living in seclusion in his castle Xanadu, which was taken from Hearst's own real-life private castle - San Simeon. We learn of Kane's rise to power, as a simple newspaper owner to a political-hopeful man, to his downfall when he is disovered to have an affair with a struggling singer, who eventually becomes his second wife. More sad news, his first wife, Emily, and son Charles III, were killed in an auto accident. Told by his friends, Jed Leland and Mr. Bernstein, and by his second wife, the shadowed figure of a man named Jerry Thompson (William Alland) uncovers each secret that reveals some truth to the myth of Charles Foster Kane.In the end, we find out what &quot;Rosebud&quot; meant. His sled, which was prominent in the beginning, was a reminder of his lost childhood. He never wanted the money, only love! But, according to Leland, he wanted &quot;love on his own terms,&quot; which sadly costed him in the end. Truly thought-provoking and moving!At the Academy Awards, Orson Welles received 4 personal nominations from CITIZEN KANE's 9 noms in 1941 for Best Actor, Best Director, Best Screenplay (with Herman Mmankiewicz), and Best Picture. The only award the film received was the Best Screenplay Oscar!From the haunting score by Bernard Herrmann to the shadowy photography by Gregg Toland to the fast-paced editing by future Oscar-winning director Robert Wise (WEST SIDE STORY, THE SOUND OF MUSIC), CITIZEN KANE proved to be a film way ahead of its time; as well as a film that could stand among the very best!Orson Welles's debut proved

The Blu ray copy of Kane is Glorious!! All the detailed work that Welles, Toland, the makeup artist, and set decorators contributed to his here for all the world to enjoy after those who created them have left us. This set includes the HBO film RKO 281, it is a short sometimes untrue, but very entertaining movie about Orson's making of Kane. The film stars Liev Shrieber, John Malkovich, (the Late Great) Roy Scheider, and James Cromwell as Hearst, all of whom are in top form. It is only 80mins long but a lot of fun and it adds to the aura that exists around Kane, definitely worth a watch. Also included is the Excellent documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane, 2 hours of fascinating details about the lives of Hearst & Welles and what happened when these Titans collided. It is a very entertaining, and informative film, which helps explain these 2 men without drawing conclusions, they give hints and facts and let the audience decide what the story really tells you about them. Also the film has 2 commentary tracks, and they are wildly different as you would expect from Roger Ebert and Welles Biographer and friend Peter Bogdonavich. Ebert is a movie nut and gives quick exciting stories and tidbits about the film, the actors and the influence of the picture, it is very enjoyable. Bogdonavich is much more outrageous and &#34;artsy&#34; for lack of a better word, he fills his commentary with second hand Welles tales, and more personal bits from Welles life, it is also very entertaining.

But also best for being so incredibly entertaining while being self-consciously clever. There are lots of good jokes (including one famously rude in-joke*), and it's splendidly cynical about business and politics in a way that US films probably aren't allowed to do any more.The DVD release does everything a DVD should: giving us a generous supply of outtakes, &quot;making of&quot; information that help you look at details (even now) with a fresh eye, discussions with the people who made the film, and some of the many critics who've carved themselves a living out of talking about it.But in the end, I don't expect I'll watch all that other stuff very often. Maybe once more. In the end it's the film, _Citizen Kane_, in a format that beats the hell out of video, looking crisp and clear and sounding terrific, that makes this a worthwhile buy.Cheers!Laon* &quot;Rosebud&quot; wasn't just a symbol of Kane's innocent, lost,childhood. It was also, out in the real world, a pet name that William Randolph Hearst used for, er, an intimate part of his lover's (Marion Davies) body.

The way some people nitpick about trivialities! Who cares if the original negative is gone, and this one isn't dipped in platinum?  Not me. The awesome Citizen Kane is extremely well done in every way. The genius of Orson Welles is evident in every frame, nook and cranny of this extraordinary film.It is,simply, a stunner of exhorbitant proportion. CK is a treat for the senses, it sort of lulls one into an asctetic experience of what real film making is, and, sadly, will never be again. This boxed set is magnificent. I will not extrapolate on the contents, as other reviewers have repeated ad nauseum. Suffice to say that, for roughly thirty bucks you get a marvelous package. The other two discs are very interesting nostalgia as to the behind the scenes scuffle regarding W.R. Hearst and Marian Davies (shhh that's where ""rosebud"" had its origins. It supposedly was a pet name given by Hearst to describe part of Davies' anatomy that he was extremely fond of). Needless to say, CK fans will adore this boxed set.I did not find any fault with the packaging, unlike some other reviewers here, and, again, to nitpick through this legendary film is to dilute its impact on future first time viewers.It is a first class film, THE film of the century.

In each camp, the reviewers insult the other camp.  Each camp screams that the other camp has no taste.Citizen Kane is not, in my opinion, anywhere close to being the best film ever.  I've seen several movies in the last few weeks that I believe are better - Amelie and Aguirre The Wrath Of God.  I'm sure there are dozens more I would place above Citizen Kane.  But it does have some points in its favor.It is the story of an extremely egocentric man.  Maybe that is redundant.  Aren't we all extremely egocentric.  Most of us are.  I don't think we can comfortably point at Kane and say we are so different, that we can't be compared to him.One of his traits was a desire to show how right he was, how ""good"" he was.  That is why he finished his employee's negative review of his own wife's singing, despite the fact that it would hurt his wife's feelings terribly and even make himself look bad.  He did it to demonstrate how wonderful he was.  Don't we all like to be right, to show people up, to win every argument.Despite his egocentricity, Kane wasn't a bad man.  He was actually a very good one.  Better than most.Apparently the one thing he cherished most was the joy of childhood.  I'd go along with that.  I think the happiest times of my life were in childhood too.  Once we grow up, things start to get complicated and go bad, and we start to make mistakes and get hurt.I never trust cliches, and it is a cliche that this movie is the very best film ever made, and it was produced impeccably.  I disagree on both points.  My biggest criticism of it is that it doesn't reach me, on a gut level, or on an emotional level, or even on an intellectual level, as much as some others do.The first time I saw it, many years ago, it disappointed me very much.  Parts of it dragged, parts of it were draining.  I would have described the slow parts as ponderous and tiresome.Seeing it for a second time, I thought it was worth 3 stars out of 5.  It is not the masterpiece it's cracked up to be, but it does have its strengths.I will not join the masses bowing to the genius Orson Welles, just as I will not join the masses bowing to the genius Stanley Kubrick.  I think they are both overrated, particularly Kubrick, but when it comes to the word ""overrated"", Orson Welles and Citizen Kane come quickly to mind.Another film that is often called the greatest of all time is Casablanca.  I'd have to take Casablanca over Kane.",3,Egocentric non-hero,1120176000,"07 1, 2005",2005,2510,"['reviews', 'site', 'are', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'types', 'garbage', 'camp', 'reviewers', 'insult', 'other', 'camp', 'camp', 'other', 'camp', 'taste.Citizen', 'Kane', 'not', 'opinion', 'anywhere', 'close', 'being', 'best', 'film', 'ever', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'several', 'movies', 'last', 'few', 'weeks', 'believe', 'are', 'better', 'Amelie', 'Aguirre', 'Wrath', 'God', ""'m"", 'sure', 'are', 'dozens', 'more', 'would', 'place', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'have', 'points', 'favor.It', 'story', 'extremely', 'egocentric', 'man', 'Maybe', 'redundant', 'Are', ""n't"", 'extremely', 'egocentric', 'Most', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'can', 'comfortably', 'point', 'Kane', 'say', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'compared', 'him.One', 'traits', 'was', 'desire', 'show', 'how', 'right', 'was', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'why', 'finished', 'employee', 'negative', 'review', 'own', 'wife', 'singing', 'fact', 'would', 'hurt', 'wife', 'feelings', 'terribly', 'even', 'make', 'look', 'bad', 'did', 'demonstrate', 'how', 'wonderful', 'was', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'right', 'show', 'people', 'up', 'win', 'argument.Despite', 'egocentricity', 'Kane', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'man', 'was', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'Better', 'most.Apparently', 'one', 'thing', 'cherished', 'most', 'was', 'joy', 'childhood', ""'d"", 'go', 'along', 'think', 'happiest', 'times', 'life', 'were', 'childhood', 'too', 'grow', 'up', 'things', 'start', 'get', 'complicated', 'go', 'bad', 'start', 'make', 'mistakes', 'get', 'hurt.I', 'never', 'trust', 'cliches', 'cliche', 'movie', 'very', 'best', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'was', 'produced', 'impeccably', 'disagree', 'points', 'biggest', 'criticism', ""n't"", 'reach', 'gut', 'level', 'emotional', 'level', 'even', 'intellectual', 'level', 'as', 'much', 'others', 'do.The', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'disappointed', 'very', 'much', 'Parts', 'dragged', 'parts', 'were', 'draining', 'would', 'have', 'described', 'slow', 'parts', 'ponderous', 'tiresome.Seeing', 'second', 'time', 'thought', 'was', 'worth', '3', 'stars', '5', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'cracked', 'up', 'be', 'have', 'strengths.I', 'will', 'not', 'join', 'masses', 'bowing', 'genius', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'just', 'will', 'not', 'join', 'masses', 'bowing', 'genius', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'think', 'are', 'overrated', 'particularly', 'Kubrick', 'when', 'word', 'overrated', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'come', 'quickly', 'mind.Another', 'film', 'often', 'called', 'greatest', 'time', 'Casablanca', ""'d"", 'have', 'take', 'Casablanca', 'Kane']",N/A

297548,A17FLA8HQOFVIG,6302135621,Linda Linguvic,"[15, 18]","Loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, this is the story of the rise and fall of one of the wealthiest men in the world.  It is also the story of a period of time in American history beginning in the 1890s when it seemed that all was possible.  Its innovative film techniques also raised the standard to which the world of film would forevermore have to aspire.The film begins with the death of the rich man, Charles Forster Kane.  The audience sees newsreel footage about his life and so the general outline is established early.  But when a newspaper reporter now interviews all the people who knew him well, the flashbacks tell the real story.  Orson Wells plays Kane in an outstanding performance, the use of makeup as well as his voice and body language making him age before our eyes.  Joseph Cotton plays his best friend.  And Agnes Moorehead has a small role as his mother.  The rest of the cast's names are less familiar today:  Ruth Warrick is cast as his first wife; Ray Collins as a corrupt politician; Everett Sloan as his business associate; Dorothy Comingore as his second wife.  They were all young unknowns then, and it was Orson Wells' skill that brought out outstanding performances from all.The Turner Classic Edition of the video I watched included a short piece about the technical aspects of creating the film, which I found fascinating.  According to Robert Wise, who did the film editing, shooting though cheesecloth filled with sand to get a grainy effect created the newsreel shots.  Some shots were done from a camera that was actually placed below floor level and aimed upwards or a ceiling camera aimed downwards. The dominant characters had camera angles aimed upwards at them; the weaker characters were shot with camera angles aimed downward. The film is shot in black and white with high contrast, often having the foreground characters completely in shadow. Often, the features of a character are indistinct and shadowy and it is the voice that carried the action.  Other times, the entire scene is in what is called ""deep focus"" with every bit of it absolutely clear.  It was Wells' genius that made it all work so well.The film moved fast and held my interest throughout.  There was never a lull or a dull moment because of the technique of overlapping dialog, which moved the viewer from one scene to another with maximum effect.  No detail was left out to make this a perfect film, which can be watched over and over again, just to see its unique composition.  I give this video my highest recommendation.  If you've never seen it, don't miss it.  If you've seen it before, see it again.",5,No detail left out.

297549,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,6302135621,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[5, 7]","Citizen Kane was created when Orson Welles was only 26 years old, and came out in 1941, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor. The film is based on the life of William Randolph Hearst and there were many legal battles between Welles and Hearst.It's always hard to read or watch a ""classic"" without having huge expectations - and perhaps not just enjoying the film. That's true for books you're required to read in high school as well as for movies. You might really have enjoyed reading ""Pride and Prejudice"" - but if you're forced to read it and told ""this is a great book!"" you might not enjoy it at all.Let me say first why this is a classic. There are a TON of visual puns, lighting effects, production effects, that had never been used before. The in-focus effects were spectacular when this movie came out. It was an incredible groundbreaker - one that inspired thousands of other filmmakers. If you weren't around in 1941, then in essence everything you watch is ""based"" on this. It's like praising Edgar Allen Poe for writing mysteries, if you love mysteries that exist now. They draw their origin from that spectacular start.If you were born after 1941, you might say ""well that's interesting, but I don't have to like the pyramids of Egypt to like modern architecture. I like Van Halen even though some of their songs were really written by classic blues artists 40+ years earlier; I don't like the blues original songs. I like current stuff and don't care about what it was based on.""That is of course true, and a human trait. So if you're not a fan of ""tracing the roots"" of movies you love, let's just take the movie itself as a standalone entity - as the story of a man.Orson Wells made this as his very first movie - and he not only acted in it but also directed it. He was a newbie. He did some amazing things in his very first attempt every to make a movie. To start with, you as the viewer are really ""drawn in"" to the movie in a way that most movies don't do. The interviewer is usually in the lower right, i.e. sort of where you, the audience, are sitting. You and the interviewer are both directly talking to and interacting with the people on the screen.Kane was ""stolen"" from his family at a very young age - raised by strangers, sent off to schools and training. He grew up alone, with only some friends to keep him company. He decides when just out of college to run a newspaper, sort of a lark. He has great ideals - to help the little man. Once he gets a taste of power and public affection, he gets addicted to it. He begins to create stories that don't really exist, to ""make world events happen"". He starts to manipulate the people around him to get him more and more attention. When he gets abandoned, you feel sorry for him - but you also know it's completely his own fault.These aren't just random vague events that are happening in outer space. They are very personal events happening to a ""real person"" - this was of course based on real life events of that era. Not only that, but they could happen to any of us. We all have tasks that we do, that bring us joy. We all have the potential to have growth with our dreams - but if we got that growth, would we do ""good"" with that power, or would we start to be tainted? If we had power over those we love, would we use it 100% for their own good, or would we do subtle things that made US happy and not necessarily them? How many parents, for example, pushed kids to go to a particular college because it appealed to the parent, even if it wasn't the perfect match for the child's personality?This obviously isn't a hack and slash movie with a lot of combat and violence. It's a movie about the trade-offs we all make as we go for our dreams, find success, find failure, try to make love work. This isn't the story of a 23 year old having a fun college life. It's the story of the full life of a man - from sad, lonely young child, to idealistic young man, to a sad, lonely old man.The way life affects us - and the way in which our choices affect our life - are universal concepts that are really important to pretty much every human being. It might be that some particular humans might not care yet. Certainly I remember for example when I was a teenager that I didn't give a lot of thought to the nebulous ""long off future"". Now that I'm a bit older, though, the thoughts of choices made, opportunities missed and long term goals are very important to me.

297555,A29D83NKRLFA34,6302135621,Luke McCall,"[4, 5]","For what it is, Citizen Kane is damn near perfect. But it really does have flaws just as any movie does. Critics rave about the camera angles, the script, the story.... As a film buff and aspiring filmmaker, I cannot discount the greatness of Citizen Kane. But it was only until such filmmakers as Stanley Kubrick, Martin Scorcese, Francis Ford Coppola came along that we really did start to see just how influential this film was.Before and after Kane, Frank Capra, John Ford, Cecil B. DeMille, and Victor Fleming films were really the greatest films in Hollywood. People loved the romantic, soft, sometimes-sentimental Frank Capra pictures... in fact, he was one of the many filmmakers to inspire Steven Spielberg. People loved the harsh but ultimately Hollywood vision of reality in John Ford's masterpieces (The Grapes of Wrath)... and we still do. Cecil B. DeMille was among the chief epic filmmakers... and he still is. Then Victor Fleming came along. I know it's hard to say that Gone With the Wind was all due to the greatness of one man, but he sure helped. His other great film that year was the legendary Wizard of Oz which is still a beloved classic for children. However...Even though Orson Welles gave us the ""Greatest Film in American Cinema"" (again, I'm not stating a fact), he still cannot be considered the greatest or most influential filmmaker in the history of film. I believe that top prize will always belong to the unmatched master of suspense, Alfred Hitchock. None of his films suggests influence of Kane. In fact, he made Notorious with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman just a few years before Kane, and that film had some pretty Hitchcock-esque shots. He was his own great filmmaker, he didn't need any influence.However, Citizen Kane has aged pretty well over the years. It feels real and somewhat modern, it looks real and modern, and it sounds like it could have been made easily today. But, many people have their own favorite film. They will attack anyone who tries to persuade them differently. That's why I think it is almost unwise and definitely unfair for AFI or any critic to dictate to people what the greatest film is. Nothing is set in stone. A lot of the ""know-nothing"" audiences still believe Gone With the Wind or Casablanca, Star Wars or Titanic is the greatest. Are these critics elevating themselves above the average moviegoer because of their extensive research, because of all of their experience critiquing movies, because they've watched so many???Roger Ebert, who gives an audio commentary to the film... I guess he's trying to say that he's a film historian who knows all there is to know about can... he didn't like Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid. Now, that was a favorite for many moviegoers. He has the brass to put down a movie that so many people love and at the same time, he's telling them what they should see. When film critics can be that influential, I think its time we start thinking about discarding the purpose of such Hollywood bigotry.Now, I have nothing against him personally, I like Ebert today moreso than I did way back when. He actually was one of the few who defended my favorite film, Titanic when it came out. But, he - like all of the other ""know-it-alls"" think they can tell us what is the greatest film. They can't. We're not all wise to the ways of film. We know what we like. I don't adore Citizen Kane, but I respect it just the same.I've seen well-over 700 films, including a lot of ""great"" films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and I still prefer Gone With the Wind to Citizen Kane or Casablanca.

Everyone praised his work as that of a great genius but no one would give him more work, after Citizen Kane was hailed as a masterpiece but still lost $150,000. And no investor was willing to put up money for a brilliant but eccentric genius no matter how gifted who couldn't pull in the receipts at the box office--essentially no different from what happens today.Welles's predicament reminded me of the great Spencer Tracy at the end of his career, who said the same thing. Prior to his being cast in ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" no one would insure him for the movie due to his heart condition, so he and Katherine bought the insurance themselves, according to the story. He made the same comment about everyone praising his work but no one being willing to hire him.This film resembles more a 19th century late romantic symphony or a work of jaded Impressionism than a typical American film. It melds dramatic camera angles and cinematography, world weary, fin de siecle dialog, a brooding and almost nihilistic atmosphere, and a non-chronological timeline to create what for the time was a revolutionary film. In one scene in the film, where the enraged Welles as Hearst is trashing his study, scattering books and various objects everywhere, he said afterwords, ""By God, I felt it, I really felt it.""

It was the debut in the director's seat of also first-time big screen actor, co-writer and producer, Orson Welles. He was surrounded by a cast of experienced actors, most of which were new to the big screen as well: there goes a couple of ""first times."" In terms of the script, the fast-forward and rewinding of events into the future and back to the past is simply mind-boggling. Welles accomplishes the magical time shifts by resorting to some pretty nifty editing tricks (fading out, fading in, etc.) This might be something that movies such as Pulp Fiction or Memento have us a little more used to these days, but Citizen Kane broke film-making ground when it accomplished this back 1941. Also, the content of the script itself was very controversial back then, due to the fact that it was ""loosely based"" on a real-life big media mogul, William Randolph Hearst. This caused the movie to suffer all kinds of oposition and delays at the time, in spite of the fact that the contract Welles signed with RKO for the movie was one that allowed him creative freedom in ways that are evident all through the movie, and that can be the envy of today's Hollywood's directors. Yet, as controversial as the story was ""outside,"" the story itself is based on a concept that strikes for its simplicity: ""Rosebud,"" Charles Foster Kane's last word, and the pursue of its meaning by a team of journalists, among the people that supposedly knew the man well. Supposedly, because appearances can be deceiving...Illumination is simply fantastic: the game of shadows and bright lights to cast more suspense or cheer up a particular scene is superb. The angles from which the actors are shot at times, break not only the normally accepted paradigms of directing at the time, but also the studios floors (since they required the use of a hatchet to make way through the wooden floors, down to a point where the camera could be placed at footstep level.) The effect this accomplished in terms of the scenes shot this way was amazing, since dominant (power) characters where shot from below, thus making them ""larger"" and more imposing than they would have looked like, had they been shot normally. Likewise, submissive or powerless characters were shot from above, much from the perspective of the dominant characters.Some scenes are worth a thousand Oscars, one of my favorite ones being the one where one of the reporters walks into this huge room under custody and is furnished with a book from the diaries of another wealthy man who was close to Kane, in order to read about Kane in it. The scene is just magnificent, in terms of illumination (shadows below, god-like illumination from above), camera angle, script, everything... And this one is only one of several, that make up a movie that has stood the test of time, and has become a pivotal influence to most of today's directors. I hope I have made my point, but if I haven't, long-story, short: you can't afford not to see ""Citizen Kane.""",5,No wonder it's the best movie of all times!,1018051200,"04 6, 2002",2002,3140,"['When', 'start', 'realize', 'how', 'many', 'first', 'times', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'made', 'wonder', 'been', 'deemed', 'best', 'movie', 'times', 'was', 'debut', 'director', 'seat', 'also', 'first-time', 'big', 'screen', 'actor', 'co-writer', 'producer', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'surrounded', 'cast', 'experienced', 'actors', 'most', 'were', 'new', 'big', 'screen', 'as', 'well', 'couple', 'first', 'times', 'terms', 'script', 'fast-forward', 'rewinding', 'events', 'future', 'back', 'past', 'simply', 'mind-boggling', 'Welles', 'magical', 'time', 'shifts', 'resorting', 'pretty', 'nifty', 'editing', 'tricks', 'fading', 'out', 'fading', 'etc', 'might', 'be', 'something', 'movies', 'such', 'Pulp', 'Fiction', 'Memento', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'used', 'days', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'broke', 'film-making', 'ground', 'when', 'accomplished', 'back', '1941', 'Also', 'content', 'script', 'was', 'very', 'controversial', 'back', 'then', 'due', 'fact', 'was', 'loosely', 'based', 'real-life', 'big', 'media', 'mogul', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'caused', 'movie', 'suffer', 'kinds', 'oposition', 'delays', 'time', 'spite', 'fact', 'contract', 'Welles', 'signed', 'RKO', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'allowed', 'creative', 'freedom', 'ways', 'are', 'evident', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'envy', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'directors', 'Yet', 'as', 'controversial', 'story', 'was', 'outside', 'story', 'based', 'concept', 'simplicity', 'Rosebud', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'last', 'word', 'pursue', 'meaning', 'team', 'journalists', 'people', 'supposedly', 'knew', 'man', 'well', 'Supposedly', 'appearances', 'can', 'be', 'deceiving', 'Illumination', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'game', 'shadows', 'bright', 'lights', 'cast', 'more', 'suspense', 'cheer', 'up', 'particular', 'scene', 'superb', 'angles', 'actors', 'are', 'shot', 'times', 'break', 'not', 'only', 'normally', 'accepted', 'paradigms', 'directing', 'time', 'also', 'studios', 'floors', 'required', 'use', 'hatchet', 'make', 'way', 'wooden', 'floors', 'down', 'point', 'where', 'camera', 'could', 'be', 'placed', 'footstep', 'level', 'effect', 'accomplished', 'terms', 'scenes', 'shot', 'way', 'was', 'amazing', 'dominant', 'power', 'characters', 'where', 'shot', 'thus', 'making', 'larger', 'more', 'imposing', 'would', 'have', 'looked', 'had', 'been', 'shot', 'normally', 'Likewise', 'submissive', 'powerless', 'characters', 'were', 'shot', 'much', 'perspective', 'dominant', 'characters.Some', 'scenes', 'are', 'thousand', 'Oscars', 'one', 'favorite', 'ones', 'being', 'one', 'where', 'one', 'reporters', 'walks', 'huge', 'room', 'custody', 'furnished', 'book', 'diaries', 'wealthy', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'close', 'Kane', 'order', 'read', 'Kane', 'scene', 'just', 'magnificent', 'terms', 'illumination', 'god-like', 'illumination', 'camera', 'angle', 'script', 'everything', 'one', 'only', 'one', 'several', 'make', 'up', 'movie', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'become', 'pivotal', 'influence', 'most', 'today', 'directors', 'hope', 'have', 'made', 'point', 'have', ""n't"", 'long-story', 'short', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'not', 'see', 'Citizen', 'Kane']",N/A

Is it simply for the entertainment and enjoyment value or because the technical aspects (acting, direction, etc.) were great? In short, for both reasons. But some movies only fall on one side of these categories. The art of filmmaking has many purposes. It can provide a cheerful and sensational escape from reality but it can also uphold a moral truth, show the consequences of a good or bad decision, depict history or illuminate the good, bad and ugly aspects of life. However most people see movies to be entertained or cheered up so when they come across a movie like Citizen Kane that doesn't even try to be cheerful, uplifting or entertaining, they don't know how to react.Citizen Kane is a tragedy, and Charles is not a particularly likeable character but depressing stories with unlikeable characters are not worthless if they have a moral lesson. A tragedy with redeeming values can certainly be good. Herman Mankiewicz (screenwriter) obviously meant the movie to be a satirical, hard-hitting swipe at the shallowness and emptiness of the elite and he succeeds completely. His style of writing is brief, concise and to the point--not one line is wasted.Charles manages to become the wealthiest man in America and a very powerful, influential person worldwide. Yet for all his prestige, he ruins the good life for himself with his own lousy choices. Just as he leaves his first wife Emily for Susan when he gets tired of her his second wife leaves him when she gets tired of him. He showers Susan with all the luxuries money can buy (just like Rhett Butler does to Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind) helps her get started on her career as an opera singer, sticks up for her when her music teacher gives her a hard time and tends to her when she is sick in bed. Yet she is shallow and selfish (again just like Scarlet) just as he was to Emily. His tearing up her room in a fit of rage when she leaves him and stopping to pause at the globe with the cottage reminiscent of his childhood home when he was young and innocent is a powerful depiction of the old saying ""What goes around comes around."" As his co-worker Jedidiah Leland says later on, he wanted everyone to love him. He kept sucking it up but was too selfish to give any of it to his family and friends. (With the possible exception of the examples of how treats Susan.) As a result he drove them all away and died a miserable man.Orson Wells does an excellent job in the title role. He smoothly glides through all the stages of Charles' life--as an innocent cheerful young man, arrogant newspaper critic and corrupt politician.All the other actors offer strong support especially Dorothy Comingore as Susan who slowly transforms from a sweet, likeable, down-to-earth young lady to a melodramatic, temperamental, annoying shrew.Ruth Warrick as Emily, the first wife, doesn't have much to do but she looks absolutely beautiful especially in that white fur and silk dress in the blackmail/confrontation scene and proves a warm, sweet, lovely and endearing presence--heck, I would have chosen her over Susan in a heartbeat!Much has been said about how the special cameras angles help enhance the storyline. I quite agree. My favorite parts were the up and down shots during the blackmail scene and the long shots going up and down on the stage during Susan's stage performance.

297571,A2R6RA8FRBS608,6302135621,Matthew G. Sherwin,"[1, 1]","Please note: This review is for the two-disc special edition of Citizen Kane.Citizen Kane is one of the best movies I've ever watched but after all the reviews here it's hard for me to add anything new--at least to the reviews that rave about the picture, that is! The acting is superb and it should be noted that at least two prominent actors, Agnes Moorehead and Joseph Cotton, had their feature length film debut in this picture! Orson Welles doesn't simply act, he directs wonderfully and his contributions to the script (which were pretty significant) enhance the film greatly. (Herman J. Mankiewicz also wrote a fair amount of the script.)I was particularly impressed with just how well certain camera techniques were employed in Citizen Kane. True, some of these techniques may have been used before but I doubt they were ever used so effectively up until this film was made. One technique that was in fact pioneered was ""deep focus;"" this is ""a technique that keeps every object in the foreground, center and background in simultaneous focus. This brought a sense of depth to the two-dimensional world of movies. (The Internet Movie Database)."" Another brilliant technique used in Citizen Kane is the way the camera often looks up at ""powerful"" figures like Kane and down at people like Susan Alexander Kane who is not exactly at her most powerful when she fights with Charles Foster Kane. I also liked the way they made it appear that Kane was addressing a crowd during a political campaign; while the filmmakers actually used a still photo of a crowd (with the camera appearing to look at a crowd from the rear), tiny holes were made in the photo and they used moving lights to make it seem as if the crowd were actually live--very clever indeed!As for the storyline itself, the film shows us the life of political newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles) in flashbacks that are somewhat nonlinear. The central character, Kane, is obviously based on political newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst and his life--there are too many similarities for this to be interpreted any other way. Ruth Warrick is exceptional as the first Mrs. Kane, Emily Monroe Norton, the niece of the president at the time Kane marries her (Hearst never married a president's niece--he just married a woman with the same last name as then-President Wilson). We see how that marriage progresses--and the second Mrs. Kane, Susan Alexander Kane (Dorothy Comingore), represents Hearst's mistress Marion Davies (Susan sings for her public just as Marion Davies acted in Hollywood for the public). Dorothy Comingore gives a fine performance opposite Orson Welles! There are other similarities between Kane and Hearst but I'll stop to avoid spoiling that part of the story for you!Nevertheless, it's still well worth repeating what some others have noted: that the ""No Trespassing"" sign (at Xanadu, Kane's huge estate) shown at the very beginning and the end of the film is quite meaningful--just as the sign tells people to stay off the grounds of the estate, Charles Foster Kane lives his life staying away from other people--he doesn't ever truly learn how to love another selflessly and give to another without expecting something back as if he owned that person or group of people. The way Kane is robbed of a childhood with love and tender care from two parents sets him up for personal failure despite all the financial success he gains--and could possibly lose.Look also for solid performances by Agnes Moorhead as Charles' mother Mary who sends him away at a tender age with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris) as his guardian; and Everett Sloane is wonderful as Mr. Bernstein. Ray Collins plays Kane's political opponent James W. Gettys and Erskine Sanford plays Herbert Carter. William Alland plays newspaper reporter Jerry Thompson (whose face is almost always completely in the shadows) and Paul Stewart plays Raymond, the head butler at Xanadu, Kane's huge estate. Harry Shannon has a brief role as Kane's father. Look closely and you'll see Alan Ladd as a reporter at the end of the film (he's smoking a pipe) and cinematographer Gregg Toland plays the interviewer in the 1935 newsreel. Nat ""King"" Cole has an uncredited role as the pianist at the El Rancho club.This fine two DVD set comes with bonus features: the first DVD has short but very good footage of the premiere of Citizen Kane; I also liked the storyboards, photos and correspondence we get to see. The second DVD has an extensive and brilliant documentary entitled ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" which, as Amazon notes above, explores the not so smooth relationship between Orson Welles and William Randolph Hearst.Citizen Kane is a must-have for fans of the actors in this film and film aficionados everywhere. This is an example of American cinema at its very best.",5,"""A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms.""",1396742400,"04 6, 2014",2014,4843,"['Please', 'note', 'review', 'two-disc', 'special',

297573,A1CFIU3IBUH24U,6302135621,"Matthew Menjou ""Mattyboy""","[5, 5]","At the age of 25, Orson Welles burst onto the Hollywood scene with this masterpiece. The fact that this film is in black and white and is considered the best ever made unfortunately scares away many from my generation; little do they realize that this was perhaps the most modern film of the period. From its revolutionary (and still awe-inspiring) visual style to its memorable performances, Citizen Kane is a genius accomplishment. Welles, like a sponge, soaked in the qualities of world cinema (primarily European cinema) and used these tools to create a film that is unlike anything before or since.

If the AFI never put out a top 100 list, this film would have fallen into obscurity long ago, and it would have stayed where it belongs, a novelty for film school students...First let me start by saying that although I appreciate Star Wars, I was not brought up on MTV.I am a tremendous fan of movies in general, and a huge fan of black-and-white films..the greatest ever....Casablanca....also very good, almost anything by Frank Capra...and for those into action, go rent (or better buy) a copy of Gunga Din........But Citizen Kane is simply....unwatchable....It is sooooooo boring......I give Orsen Wells a lot a credit for making a movie at 24, but if he was 44 and this was his 20th film would everyone still be so enamored with it??If film people like it because it has ""out of the ordinary"" camera angles, and uses film tricks like ""flashbacks"", fine, but that does not make this a good movie...By the way, one thing has always bothered me about the movie that nobody ever brings up. Everyone says that Wells was so ""brave"" in making a film belittling William Randolf Hearst (one of the most powerful men of his time). My question is, how shallow was Orsen Wells that he had to try to make a name for himself by attacking someone else. Now maybe Hearst was a creap, and deserved to be attacked, but if you made the same movie and had the lead character be an oil tycoon, or a bank president, Wells (and his movie) would not have had the buzz it did back in 1941 or even today for that matter.

Hickey,"[1, 1]","After the disappointing previous DVD release of ""Citizen Kane,"" which was gray, smeary and over-processed to the point of looking like it was shot on videotape instead of film, I was hoping the new hi-def Blu-Ray version would reverse those errors are restore the evocatively shadowy and contrasty look of cinematographer Gregg Toland's beautiful black-and-white photography. It does so, and more. The images are now perfect, pristine, luminous; the shadows are deep and black, the whites sparkle.  Faces that were intended to be in deep shadow are. With the photographic style of the film meticulously honored in this hi-def version, it is amazing how compelling the images are, and how they convey and deepen the poetic and psychological aspects of the story.  After watching this movie at least 25 times -- first on TV in the 50s (where its modern reputation began to build), later on 16mm and 35mm film, VHS and DVD -- watching this hi-def Blu-Ray is almost like seeing it for the first time, with the subtlety and nuance of the images visible as never before.  The sound is also perfect.  Pops, hiss, clicks: all gone.  Bernard Hermann's music regains its startling and layered complexity, and Welles' orchestration of every aspect of the soundtrack (using techniques from his years directing radio dramas) is a master class in sound design.

We were drawing parallels between fictional newspaper giant Charles Foster Kane and real-life media mogul William Randolph Hearst.  There are so many coincidences that it's no wonder this film was almost halted before it hit theatres.But it's still fantastic and especially revolutionary for 1941.  Multi-hyphenate Orson Welles and cinematographer Gregg Tollan employed innovative filmmaking tricks that had never been thought of before.  And Welles delivers a stirring performance as sometimes carefree, sometimes brutal, but always wealthy Kane.  It's an engrossing and interesting story filled with success, heartache, and scandal.In order to appreciate the caliber of this movie, you must understand film history and how advanced this movie was compared with other films made around the same time.  You must also have some knowledge of Hearst's life so you can appreciate some of the humor and satire.  Otherwise, you will find it boring and certainly won't understand why the AFI called it the greatest movie ever.Do I think it's the greatest movie ever made?  No.  What is the point in calling a movie the greatest ever made when movies are still being produced today?  Who's to say that a movie won't come along in the future that leaves &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; in the dust?  It hasn't happened yet, but it could.

297583,A2ZLROGIL2V7GV,6302135621,Michael Crane,"[3, 4]","I'm at the point of my life where I'm trying to re-watch movies that I might not have fully appreciated the first time around.  Some movies I have re-watched and still have the same conclusion (such as Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time In America;"" while I am much more of a Leone fan today than years ago, I still consider that my least favorite of his).  And then there is ""Citizen Kane,"" which I HATED with an absolute passion the first time I saw it many years ago.  Maybe it was because of all of the praise the film gets that jaded my feelings on it.  It could've been all the hate mail I got for giving a bad review of the movie.  Or, it could've been I was a dumb kid who didn't fully understand good filmmaking.It was a little of all three, if you ask me.  Two years ago or so, I felt it was time to give Charles Foster Kane another shot, and now I can finally appreciate it for what it is.  Now, I can see why it gets all of the accolades it has received.  I wasn't a big fan of the story when I first saw it, and because of that it clouded my vision, not allowing me to see how brilliantly filmed it was.  Also, I didn't know the full history behind the movie, which I will get into later.In short, ""Citizen Kane"" follows the life of newspaper tycoon, Charles Foster Kane.  When he passes away, he utters one final phrase that has everybody wondering what he meant.  A reporter sets out to find out what it could possibly mean, and what he's presented is a portrait of a very complicated and sad life, no matter how successful Kane had become.The star of the movie, understand, is not the writing--although now I have to say I like it more than I did back then.  The star of the film is the camera itself, presenting us very complex shots that had not been used before.  You can tell that this was Orson Welles' grand labor of love, and was willing to even give up everything in his life for it.  He would use a lot of weird camera angles that would tell the story rather than simply letting the camera face the actors.  Also, Orson gives one heck of a performance as ""Charles Foster Kane,"" completely absorbing himself into the role.Also, another thing that really makes me appreciate the movie now more than ever is the FANTASTIC documentary on the second disk entitled, ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane.""  I had no idea that this movie was inspired by a real person and because of that, Welles pretty much destroyed his film career with this very movie.  It's a must-watch if you really want to understand what it meant to Orson to have this film made.  That is what makes this Special Edition ""special,"" indeed.So, I got rid of my old review of ""Citizen Kane.""  Why?  Because I grew up some and my feelings have changed.  It's not my top favorite film, but finally I can appreciate the love and labor that went into it.  Sometimes that happens to us.  There are films that takes years for us to finally appreciate.  I'm glad I took the trip again with mature eyes and appreciation for good filmmaking. - Michael Crane**NOTE** This new review was written on July 14, 2007**",4,"""If I hadn't been very rich, I might have been a really great man...""

Beusch,"[3, 4]","So many of the films that critics unanimously pick as the greatest of all time are overrated, confusing, ponderous, overly symbolic art pieces that leave viewers scratching their heads. The collective reaction is, &quot;What in the hell was the director smoking?&quot; Arty camera work and tons of symbolism and metaphors can never take the place of good acting, solid direction and, most importantly, a good script.Much has been made of Citizen Kane's technical brilliance -- Welles' use of overlapping conversations, Gregg Toland's deep focus photography, set design that incorporates ceilings, etc. However, none of this would really mean anything if the film didn't have a great story and screenplay. Citizen Kane may be a triumph in filmmaking technique, but it is also a deeply engrossing story with characters we can relate to and sympathize with. Welles' Kane is a selfish, unhappy, overly controlling dictator who has everything and yet still manages to make himself more and more unhappy. Most of us know the feeling of not appreciating someone or something good in our lives until he/she/it is gone. We see the promise and idealism in Kane's early life, like him and believe, as Joseph Cotten's Jed Leland does, that Kane is a great man who can do so much good in society. As Kane's life progresses, however, he becomes more and more bitter, alienates everyone who cares about him and dies alone, longing for the simplicity of his early life before he became wealthy. When Kane, as an old man, loses control when his second wife Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore) leaves him, we can't help but feel for him -- even though most or all of his unhappiness is his fault. That the audience feels such empathy for such a flawed character is Citizen Kane's greatest triumph and is the true basis for Kane's reputation as one of the greatest films of all time.",5,Works on the basic levels as well as artistically,1087948800,"06 23, 2004",2004,1864,"['So', 'many', 'films', 'critics', 'unanimously', 'pick', 'greatest', 'time', 'are', 'overrated', 'confusing', 'ponderous', 'overly', 'symbolic', 'art', 'pieces', 'leave', 'viewers', 'scratching', 'heads', 'collective', 'reaction', 'quot', 'What', 'hell', 'was', 'director', 'smoking', 'quot', 'Arty', 'camera', 'work', 'tons', 'symbolism', 'metaphors', 'can', 'never', 'take', 'place', 'good', 'acting', 'solid', 'direction', 'most', 'importantly', 'good', 'script.Much', 'been', 'made', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'technical', 'brilliance', 'Welles', 'use', 'overlapping', 'conversations', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'deep', 'focus', 'photography', 'set', 'design', 'ceilings', 'etc', 'However', 'none', 'would', 'really', 'mean', 'anything', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'great', 'story', 'screenplay', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'may', 'be', 'triumph', 'filmmaking', 'technique', 'also', 'deeply', 'engrossing', 'story', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'sympathize', 'Welles', 'Kane', 'selfish', 'unhappy', 'overly', 'controlling', 'dictator', 'who', 'everything', 'yet', 'still', 'make', 'more', 'more', 'unhappy', 'Most', 'know', 'feeling', 'not', 'appreciating', 'someone', 'something', 'good', 'lives', 'he/she/it', 'gone', 'see', 'promise', 'idealism', 'Kane', 'early', 'life', 'believe', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Jed', 'Leland', 'Kane', 'great', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'good', 'society', 'Kane', 'life', 'however', 'more', 'more', 'bitter', 'everyone', 'who', 'alone', 'longing', 'simplicity', 'early', 'life', 'became', 'wealthy', 'When', 'Kane', 'old', 'man', 'control', 'when', 'second', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Alexander', 'Dorothy', 'Comingore', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'even', 'most', 'unhappiness', 'fault', 'audience', 'feels', 'such', 'empathy', 'such', 'flawed', 'character', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'greatest', 'triumph', 'true', 'basis', 'Kane', 'reputation', 'one', 'greatest', 'films', 'time']",N/A

The reason I emphasize that fact, is the reason I recommend it.  As everyone knows, Citizen Kane appears every year near the top of the list of the greatest films ever made.  In my opinion, if that were objectively true, then you could show it to anyone and they would agree, but they don't.  I have shown the film to many friends over the years and most seem puzzled by its status as the greatest.  Why?In art, there are works that stand alone.  There is no question why they were created.  Alongside these are works that are incomplete although the art dealers and art critics would never admit it.  These works have a hidden secret interpretation.  The best example is minimalism.  To the uninitiated, a solid-colored canvas seems like someone forgot to paint a picture into it, but once the concept of color fields as art is revealed, you may realize that the works connect to that idea.  So then and now, the art question hinges on whether or not an art work that needs THE BIG EXPLANATION in order to connect to the audience is a great or even good work of art.On the second disk is a fascinating documentary film called, `The Battle Over Citizen Kane.'  It is THE BIG EXPLANATION and I have found that not only do people tend to agree that Citizen Kane deserves is status as The Greatest after they view it, but often they want to see Citizen Kane again to see what they missed.  Since the documentary is somewhat required viewing for ""the greatest movie ever made,"" I have a hard time giving Citizen Kane my vote for the greatest, but I recommend anyone to watch the documentary first unless they were there in 1941.",4,The Battle for Citizen Kane,1230940800,"01 3, 2009",2009,1716,"['review', 'Turner', 'Home', 'Ent', 'version', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Two-Disc', 'Special', 'Edition', 'reason', 'emphasize', 'fact', 'reason', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'year', 'top', 'list', 'greatest', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'opinion', 'were', 'objectively', 'true', 'then', 'could', 'show', 'anyone', 'would', 'agree', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'shown', 'film', 'many', 'friends', 'years', 'most', 'seem', 'puzzled', 'status', 'greatest', 'Why', 'art', 'are', 'stand', 'alone', 'question', 'why', 'were', 'created', 'are', 'works', 'are', 'incomplete', 'art', 'dealers', 'art', 'critics', 'would', 'never', 'admit', 'works', 'have', 'hidden', 'secret', 'interpretation', 'best', 'example', 'minimalism', 'uninitiated', 'solid-colored', 'canvas', 'someone', 'forgot', 'paint', 'picture', 'once', 'concept', 'color', 'fields', 'art', 'revealed', 'may', 'realize', 'works', 'connect', 'idea', 'then', 'now', 'art', 'question', 'hinges', 'not', 'art', 'work', 'THE', 'BIG', 'EXPLANATION', 'order', 'connect', 'audience', 'great', 'even', 'good', 'work', 'second', 'disk', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'film', 'called', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'BIG', 'EXPLANATION', 'have', 'found', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'people', 'tend', 'agree', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'status', 'Greatest', 'view', 'often', 'want', 'see', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'again', 'see', 'what', 'missed', 'documentary', 'somewhat', 'required', 'viewing', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'giving', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'vote', 'greatest', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'watch', 'documentary', 'first', 'were', 'there', '1941']",N/A
297587,A3L46ZRKNFN0SG,6302135621,Michael W. Howe,"[11, 11]","Orson Welles, a visionary for his time, was a man of many things.  He was a man of teperament, and genius.  And through his early comings in theater and radio, he soon achieved an unprecedented deal: to make a feature film, no strings attached (an almost impossible thing to comprehend today).  After several mishaps, Welles settled on &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; which utilized incredible cinematography, a great cast of theater actors, and meaningful dialogue and storylines.The film starts at the end of a life, with the passing of Charles Foster Kane.  Kane's family inherited a supposedly worthless Colorado mine that tielded untold millions.  His mother put this into a fund for Charles to befully his by his 25th birthday.  Throughout his lifetime, Kane used the moeny for profit, controlling an entire newspaper empire, and also used his wealth for pleasure, buying up countless art treasures, and creating his own heaven on earth, a gigantic private kingdom called Xanadu.One news company, while putting together a newsreel of Kane footage, soon realizes that there's no real hook to keep the person interested, until one of them remembers what Kane's last word was: &quot;Rosebud.&quot;  none of the newsmen know, and one is promptly sent on an investigative search for the truth, tracking down countless friends of Kane, as well as reading the memoirs of the man who was entrusted to be his legal guardian, and a former wife.A great bonus on this disc is the documentary &quot;The Battle over Citizen Kane,&quot; which tells how William Randolph Hearst, who was somewhat portrayed in the film (Hearst was also a newspaper tycoon, spent frivolously, and created his own private estate), tried to use his power in Hollywood to keep the film from being seen (even having a huge sum of money to destroy the original negative).  Word of mouth kept advertisements from Hearst's papers, and even possibly cost Welles the Oscars (the only one the film won was for screenplay).Ok, why am I praising this film and have not given a concrete fact?  Well, here they are: the cinematography is planned out in almost every frame.  things represent a character's power, be it the size of the room or camera position.  Even the actors are the best cast I can think of from that time.  Normally when people look back on films from early cinema, the dialogue seems somewhat stilted.  Here, all the characters talk believably and their actions always come to a great means.Orson Welles, being Actor/cowriter/producer/director really did a magnificent job as Kane.  He plays him from the young man, through his leap to bellowing power, and into his old age when he can't quite grasp what he wants.  Makeup done so well, it's hard to believe it's the same person.",5,Great film to analyze and a classic in it's own right!,1003104000,"10 15, 2001",2001,2750,"['Orson', 'Welles', 'visionary', 'time', 'was', 'man', 'many', 'things', 'was', 'man', 'teperament', 'genius', 'early', 'comings', 'theater', 'radio', 'soon', 'achieved', 'unprecedented', 'deal', 'make', 'feature', 'film', 'strings', 'attached', 'almost', 'impossible', 'thing', 'comprehend', 'today', 'several', 'mishaps', 'Welles', 'settled', 'quot', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'utilized', 'incredible', 'cinematography', 'great', 'cast', 'theater', 'actors', 'meaningful', 'dialogue', 'storylines.The', 'film', 'end', 'life', 'passing', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'Kane', 'family', 'inherited', 'supposedly', 'worthless', 'Colorado', 'mine', 'tielded', 'untold', 'millions', 'mother', 'put', 'fund', 'Charles', 'befully', '25th', 'birthday', 'lifetime', 'Kane', 'used', 'moeny', 'profit', 'controlling', 'entire', 'newspaper', 'empire', 'also', 'used', 'wealth', 'pleasure', 'buying', 'up', 'countless', 'art', 'treasures', 'creating', 'own', 'heaven', 'earth', 'gigantic', 'private', 'kingdom', 'called', 'Xanadu.One', 'news', 'company', 'putting', 'together', 'newsreel', 'Kane', 'footage', 'soon', 'real', 'hook', 'keep', 'person', 'interested', 'one', 'remembers', 'what', 'Kane', 'last', 'word', 'was', 'quot', 'Rosebud.', 'quot', 'none', 'newsmen', 'know', 'one', 'promptly', 'sent', 'investigative', 'search', 'truth', 'tracking', 'down', 'countless', 'friends', 'Kane', 'as', 'well', 'reading', 'memoirs', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'entrusted', 'be', 'legal', 'guardian', 'former', 'wife.A', 'great', 'bonus', 'disc', 'documentary', 'quot', 'Battle', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'quot', 'how', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'who', 'was', 'somewhat', 'portrayed', 'film', 'Hearst', 'was', 'also', 'newspaper', 'tycoon', 'spent', 'frivolously', 'created', 'own', 'private', 'estate', 'tried', 'use', 'power', 'Hollywood', 'keep', 'film', 'being', 'seen', 'even', 'having', 'huge', 'sum', 'money', 'destroy', 'original', 'negative', 'Word', 'mouth', 'kept', 'advertisements', 'Hearst', 'papers', 'even', 'possibly', 'cost', 'Oscars', 'only', 'one', 'film', 'won', 'was', 'screenplay', '.Ok', 'why', 'am', 'praising', 'film', 'have', 'not', 'given', 'concrete', 'fact', 'Well', 'here', 'are', 'cinematography', 'planned', 'out', 'almost', 'frame', 'things', 'represent', 'character', 'power', 'be', 'size', 'room', 'camera', 'position', 'Even', 'actors', 'are', 'best', 'cast', 'can', 'think', 'time', 'Normally', 'when', 'people', 'look', 'back', 'films', 'early', 'cinema', 'dialogue', 'somewhat', 'stilted', 'Here', 'characters', 'talk', 'believably', 'actions', 'always', 'come', 'great', 'means.Orson', 'Welles', 'being', 'Actor/cowriter/producer/director', 'really', 'did', 'magnificent', 'job', 'Kane', 'young', 'man', 'leap', 'bellowing', 'power', 'old', 'age', 'when', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'grasp', 'what', 'Makeup', 'done', 'so', 'well', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'person']",N/A

I had been contemplating replacing my ""remastered"" 60th anniversary edition with the Blu ray version.  Being an active collector of films, this is a decision that comes up often.  When it comes to video tape and even laser discs, it's a pretty easy decision.  But should you automatically upgrade your DVD's to Blu ray.  If you have a limited budget, the answer isn't always yes.I can add little to the evaluations of thousands of critics, both professional and amateur, regarding the quality of the film itself.  While watching it this time around, I was amazed at the time and effort given to the makeup.  Several characters in the film including Orson Welles' Charles Foster Kane, age over several decades as the reporter allows them to reminisce in a series of flashbacks.  Given the technology of 1940, the art is at its highest in this film.  Kane in fact, begins the film as a dying old man, but the story quickly reverts to his time as a boy growing up in Colorado.  His parents decide that he should grow up in a more cultured environment so they send him off to boarding school after the discovery of silver on their property.  Eventually Kane becomes involved in newspaper publishing which leads to great wealth and politics.  The last words Kane spoke as he slipped away was ""Rosebud"".  The reporter is charged with discovering who or what Rosebud was.  This leads to the various interviews with important people in Kane's life.  Technically and artistically the film is a marvel.  The acting is top notch and all performers came from Welles' Mercury troupe.  In particular look for an excellent performance from Dorothy Comingore as Kane's second wife, singer Susan Alexander.  She has a wide range in emotions to portray in addition to various chronological ages.This edition of ""Citizen Kane"" includes the documentary ""The Battle Over Citizen Kane"" which is a fascinating film itself.  It was no secret Welles was using William Randolph Hearst as his model for Kane and California's San Simeon for Florida's Xanadu.  Hearst wasn't happy about it and did all he could to destroy the film and Welles.  I watched the DVD on a Blu ray player that upconverts/upscales the DVD to ""near Blu ray"" quality.  Does it?

On every level of craft and artistic integrity, this movie is well-deserving of the title of best movie ever made.  Even today, the film looks absolutely beautiful, and its sheer style is still admirable. The rich black-and-white picture looks absolutely fantastic, and the realism in the acting and emotions on EVERY player's part is so authentic, it really makes you feel like your watching old news reels from the 1940s.  Every film class should offer a course on this film's cinematic brilliance and mastery of craft.  There is no doubt about that in my mind, because from a technical standpoint this film just appears absolutely flawless.Well, that being said, now I must speak a more personal opinion about this movie.  The story itself is not nearly as exciting or involving as I was expecting when I first watched it, and when it all comes down to it, I personally, don't think that it by any means even has that remarkable of a story.  It's not that the story isn't good, its just not all that interesting.  Bottom line.  I can think of many, many other movies that were much more mind-blowing and held my interest much better than 'Citizen Kane' did.  I don't know that that necessarily makes them BETTER movies, but it's all relative.  There are many things that make a movie good - the direction, the camerawork, the storyline, the acting, and its very difficult to base a movie's greatness on ONE of these things.  I own 'Citizen Kane', and I've watched it probably four or five times, but not necessarily because I enjoy it, but just to further study it from a technical standpoint, including the lighting, the innovative camera angles, Orson Welles' incredible performance and every other element that seems to make it so revered in the hallowed halls of film greats.  Pretty much, my lifelong ambition has been to be a filmmaker, and there are few films that are more of a credit to their artform than 'Citizen Kane'.

An obituary newsreel documents the events in his public life. The producer of the newsreel asks a reporter, Thompson (William Alland), to find out about Kane's private life and personality, in particular to discover the meaning behind his last word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's story unfolds as a series of flashbacks.First, Thompson approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), who refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the library of Mr. Thatcher (George Coulouris). It is there that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. In the first flashback, Kane as a young child is abandoned by his mother (Agnes Moorehead) when he becomes suddenly wealthy, and sent to live with his banker, Mr Thatcher, despite the misgivings of Kane's father.Other flashbacks show Kane's entry into the newspaper business and his profit-seeking with low-quality ""yellow journalism"". He takes control of the newspaper and hires all the best journalists (which he gets from the Inquirer's rival, The Chronicle). His attempted rise to power is documented, including his first marriage to a President's niece and his campaign for the office of governor. A ""love nest"" scandal ends both his marriage and his political aspirations. Kane remarries, but his domineering personality destroys his relationships and pushes away his loved ones.Despite Thompson's numerous interviews with the people in Kane's life, he is unable to solve the mystery; he concludes that ""Rosebud"" will remain an enigma. However, the camera pans over workers burning some of Kane's many possessions. One throws an old sled, with the word ""Rosebud"" painted on it, into the fire, the same sled that Kane was riding as a child the day his mother sent him away. There is a shot of a chimney with black smoke coming out. After this twist ending, the film ends as it began, with the ""No Trespassing"" sign. The closing shot shows the ""K"" on top of the iron fence.Susan with a symbolic jigsaw puzzleCitizen Kane has inspired myriad interpretations over the decades. In Orson Welles: Hello Americans, Simon Callow argued that Citizen Kane should not just be understood as a fictional work but also as a post-fictional piece: a piece where the audience is drawn in to view themselves in the process of watching the film. In a 1941 review, Jorge Luis Borges called Citizen Kane a ""metaphysical detective story,"" in that ""... [its] subject (both psychological and allegorical) is the investigation of a man's inner self, through the works he has wrought, the words he has spoken, the many lives he has ruined..."" Borges noted that ""Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct him."" As well, ""Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the floor of a palace that is also a museum.""

At the end we realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested Charles Foster Kane is a simulacrum, a chaos of appearances.""The film combines revolutionary cinematography (by Gregg Toland, with whom Welles shared a title card, which was a gesture of Welles' appreciation for Toland's overall contribution to the film, much like John Ford previously shared credit with Toland for The Long Voyage Home) with an Oscar-winning screenplay (by Welles and Herman J. Mankiewicz -- though most film history circles consider Mankiewicz's contribution to the screenplay to be far greater than that of Welles), and a lineup of first time film actors, associates of Mr. Welles from his stint at the Mercury Theatre, such as Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead.This a true work of film art and many have tried to unsuccessfully emulate the camera angles and the methodology of the angles and pathos.Noel SerranoGala Foundation",5,A TRUE WORK OF FILM ART!,1180915200,"06 4, 2007",2007,4146,"['When', 'wealthy', 'media', 'magnate', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'enigmatic', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'obituary', 'newsreel', 'documents', 'events', 'public', 'life', 'producer', 'newsreel', 'reporter', 'Thompson', 'William', 'Alland', 'find', 'out', 'Kane', 'private', 'life', 'personality', 'particular', 'discover', 'meaning', 'last', 'word', 'reporter', 'great', 'man', 'friends', 'associates', 'Kane', 'story', 'unfolds', 'series', 'flashbacks.First', 'Thompson', 'Kane', 'second', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Alexander', 'Dorothy', 'Comingore', 'who', 'tell', 'anything', 'Thompson', 'then', 'library', 'Mr.', 'Thatcher', 'George', 'Coulouris', 'there', 'Thompson', 'Kane', 'childhood', 'first', 'flashback', 'Kane', 'young', 'child', 'abandoned', 'mother', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead', 'when', 'suddenly', 'wealthy', 'sent', 'live', 'banker', 'Mr', 'Thatcher', 'misgivings', 'Kane', 'father.Other', 'show', 'Kane', 'entry', 'newspaper', 'business', 'profit-seeking', 'low-quality', 'yellow', 'journalism', 'control', 'newspaper', 'best', 'journalists', 'Inquirer', 'rival', 'Chronicle', 'attempted', 'rise', 'power', 'documented', 'including', 'first', 'marriage', 'President', 'niece', 'campaign', 'office', 'governor', 'love', 'nest', 'scandal', 'marriage', 'political', 'aspirations', 'Kane', 'remarries', 'domineering', 'personality', 'relationships', 'away', 'loved', 'ones.Despite', 'Thompson', 'numerous', 'interviews', 'people', 'Kane', 'life', 'unable', 'solve', 'mystery', 'Rosebud', 'will', 'remain', 'enigma', 'However', 'camera', 'workers', 'burning', 'Kane', 'many', 'possessions', 'One', 'old', 'sled', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'painted', 'fire', 'same', 'sled', 'Kane', 'was', 'riding', 'child', 'day', 'mother', 'sent', 'away', 'shot', 'chimney', 'black', 'smoke', 'coming', 'out', 'twist', 'ending', 'film', 'began', 'Trespassing', 'sign', 'closing', 'shot', 'K', 'top', 'iron', 'fence.Susan', 'symbolic', 'jigsaw', 'puzzleCitizen', 'Kane', 'inspired', 'myriad', 'interpretations', 'decades', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Hello', 'Americans', 'Simon', 'Callow', 'argued', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'should', 'not', 'just', 'be', 'understood', 'fictional', 'work', 'also', 'post-fictional', 'piece', 'piece', 'where', 'audience', 'drawn', 'view', 'process', 'watching', 'film', '1941', 'review', 'Jorge', 'Luis', 'Borges', 'called', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'metaphysical', 'detective', 'story', ']', 'subject', 'psychological', 'allegorical', 'investigation', 'man', 'inner', 'self', 'works', 'wrought', 'words', 'spoken', 'many', 'lives', 'ruined', 'Borges', 'noted', 'Overwhelmingly', 'endlessly', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'fragments', 'life', 'man', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'combine', 'reconstruct', 'well', 'Forms', 'multiplicity', 'incongruity', 'abound', 'film', 'first', 'scenes', 'record', 'treasures', 'amassed', 'Kane', 'one', 'last', 'poor', 'woman', 'luxuriant', 'suffering', 'enormous', 'jigsaw', 'puzzle', 'floor', 'palace', 'also', 'museum', 'points', 'out', 'end', 'realize', 'fragments', 'are', 'not', 'governed', 'secret', 'unity', 'detested', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'simulacrum', 'chaos', 'appearances', 'film', 'combines', 'revolutionary', 'cinematography', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'whom', 'Welles', 'shared', 'title', 'card', 'was', 'gesture', 'Welles', 'appreciation', 'Toland', 'overall', 'contribution', 'film', 'much', 'John', 'Ford', 'previously', 'shared', 'credit', 'Toland', 'Long', 'Voyage', 'Home', 'Oscar-winning', 'screenplay', 'Welles', 'Herman', 'J.', 'Mankiewicz', 'most', 'film', 'history', 'circles', 'consider', 'Mankiewicz', 'contribution', 'screenplay', 'be', 'far', 'greater', 'Welles', 'lineup', 'first', 'time', 'film', 'actors', 'associates', 'Mr.', 'Welles', 'stint', 'Mercury', 'Theatre', 'such', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'Agnes', 'Moorehead.This', 'true', 'work', 'film', 'art', 'many', 'have', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'emulate', 'camera', 'angles', 'methodology', 'angles', 'pathos.Noel', 'SerranoGala', 'Foundation']",N/A

It is a genuine classic, an over-the-top, bravura debut by Orson Welles so full of innovations it has influenced the career of just about every moviemaker who's seen it. Beginning with a brief but now-famous prologue - in which the word ""Rosebud"" is uttered in a whisper by a pair of lips in ultra-close-up - it documents the rise and fall of fictional newspaper publishing tycoon Charles Foster Kane (played by Welles), whose character is based loosely on real-life tycoon William Randolph Hearst. For that reason, the movie almost didn't get made - because Hearst made so many threats, legal and otherwise, against RKO, the studio of record. Welles, only 25 years old at the time, moves the story along effortlessly. Even this many years after its release, Citizen Kane remains full of surprises for first-time viewers, with a razor-sharp, Oscar-winning script by Herman Mankiewicz and Greg Toland's ground-breaking cinematography.

297627,A1GN8UJIZLCA59,6302135621,P Magnum,"[5, 5]","Citizen Kane generally is considered the greatest film ever made.  It has top numerous lists (including AFI's Top 100 American Films) and is revered by practically every movie critic.  While some film has to rank number one, and Citizen Kane deserves the title as much as any film, actually watching the film is a bit of a letdown.  That is not to deny the film's greatness.  Orson Welles directed, co-wrote and stars in the film and he set the standard for the likes of Woody Allen and Spike Lee to command the three major components of a movie.  No one else reached the levels of greatness that Mr. Welles reached with Kane.  His acting is brilliant, the screenplay is sharp and his directing is first rate.  The fact that he only won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was a commercial bomb shows that the Academy and film going public weren't ready to accept this progressive film and how he was ahead of his time.  The actors in the film were apart of Mr. Welles' Mercury Players and they all (especially Joseph Cotton) give strong turns.  Going back to my point about the film being a bit of a letdown, I mean with all the praise and superlatives that are heaped on the Citizen Kane, the film has set such an impossible buildup, it may not meet the modern film fan's expectations.  The bonus disk is worthy of a separate release itself.  It contains the documentary, The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which itself was nominated for an Oscar, that is one of the better documentaries about Hollywood that has been produced.  Orson Welles was a true movie visionary, but despite the fact that he would go on to create many first rate films, he was never able to duplicate the greatness of Citizen Kane.",5,Raising Kane,1037318400,"11 15, 2002",2002,1707,"['Citizen', 'Kane', 'generally', 'considered', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'top', 'numerous', 'lists', 'including', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'American', 'Films', 'revered', 'practically', 'movie', 'critic', 'film', 'rank', 'number', 'one', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'title', 'as', 'much', 'film', 'actually', 'watching', 'film', 'bit', 'letdown', 'not', 'deny', 'film', 'greatness', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'directed', 'co-wrote', 'stars', 'film', 'set', 'standard', 'likes', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'command', 'three', 'major', 'components', 'movie', 'one', 'else', 'reached', 'levels', 'greatness', 'Mr.', 'Welles', 'reached', 'Kane', 'acting', 'brilliant', 'screenplay', 'sharp', 'directing', 'first', 'rate', 'fact', 'only', 'won', 'Oscar', 'screenplay', 'film', 'was', 'commercial', 'bomb', 'shows', 'Academy', 'film', 'going', 'public', 'were', ""n't"", 'ready', 'accept', 'progressive', 'film', 'how', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'actors', 'film', 'were', 'apart', 'Mr.', 'Welles', 'Mercury', 'Players', 'especially', 'Joseph', 'Cotton', 'give', 'strong', 'turns', 'Going', 'back', 'point', 'film', 'being', 'bit', 'letdown', 'mean', 'praise', 'superlatives', 'are', 'heaped', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'film', 'set', 'impossible', 'buildup', 'may', 'not', 'meet', 'modern', 'film', 'fan', 'expectations', 'bonus', 'disk', 'worthy', 'separate', 'release', 'documentary', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'nominated', 'Oscar', 'one', 'better', 'documentaries', 'Hollywood', 'been', 'produced', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'was', 'true', 'movie', 'visionary', 'fact', 'would', 'go', 'create', 'many', 'first', 'rate', 'films', 'was', 'never', 'able', 'duplicate', 'greatness', 'Citizen', 'Kane']",N/A

They expect building drama and a climax.  In this film, they get both, only the film itself is the drama and climax--the beginning, middle, and end--and not the story.Orson Welles takes all of his talents in radio, theatre, and writing and tackles a new genre, the cinema.  In the process, he does things unheard of in contemporary techniques and stuns critics... well, a few of them.  Most of the critics and the general audience ""didn't get it"", so to speak.  That of course doesn't stop its fame, for it has another pull that keeps it alive for years before it becomes embraced fully: a nice helping of controversy, both with the ""outrageous"" techniques and the, uh, political commentary.Today, we have a film that will never die and shouldn't.  Breaking traditions in more ways than one, Welles has assembled celluloid with more poetry than what has come to be expected of cinema both then and now.  Still, poetry isn't always liked, and contemporary audiences may have issue with the general dullness of the story, for after all, the career of Welles and the controversy of the film are sparks and explosions, the Rosebud mystery is the intrigue, and the importance is the art-value, but the movie itself trudges along, hardly leaving room for any entertainment.Part of this is intentional, and used to great effect.  The movie is, after all, about failure, and regardless of how many times we watch it, it is begun and end with ""No Trespassing"".  One problem modern audiences may definitely have is understanding that this film doesn't even pretend to answer its own mystery, despite the so-called revelation at the end.  It's an exploration film where the exploration is the finale, without goal.  Because of the perfection of the failure theme, the movie leaves the audience just as empty as the characters...  and then what is the audience supposed to do with it?Thus, it all becomes a matter of approach.  This film should be seen, but it doesn't necessarily have to be appreciated.  It's worthy of its place as a critically-acclaimed classic, and yet it's still debatable whether it is worth it.As for this DVD, it is an very good transfer and especially is required for the soundtrack.  For once we can finally hear why exactly she's a bad singer, we can hear his whispered death-word, and some more expressionist techniques are revealed.  Commentary tracks are interesting enough, I suppose, but the documentary is much more worth the time for seeing the importance of the movie without having anybody getting too nostalgic about the film proper.--PolarisDiB",4,The most important dull movie ever made.,1127952000,"09 29, 2005",2005,2691,"['When', 'watching', 'film', 'average', 'viewer', 'expect', 'few', 'things', 'expect', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'expect', 'building', 'drama', 'climax', 'film', 'get', 'only', 'film', 'drama', 'climax', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'not', 'story.Orson', 'Welles', 'talents', 'radio', 'theatre', 'writing', 'new', 'genre', 'cinema', 'process', 'things', 'unheard', 'contemporary', 'techniques', 'stuns', 'critics', 'well', 'few', 'Most', 'critics', 'general', 'audience', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'so', 'speak', 'course', ""n't"", 'stop', 'fame', 'pull', 'alive', 'years', 'embraced', 'fully', 'nice', 'helping', 'controversy', 'outrageous', 'techniques', 'uh', 'political', 'commentary.Today', 'have', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'die', 'should', ""n't"", 'Breaking', 'traditions', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'Welles', 'assembled', 'celluloid', 'more', 'poetry', 'what', 'come', 'be', 'expected', 'cinema', 'then', 'now', 'Still', 'poetry', ""n't"", 'always', 'liked', 'contemporary', 'audiences', 'may', 'have', 'issue', 'general', 'dullness', 'story', 'career', 'Welles', 'controversy', 'film', 'are', 'sparks', 'explosions', 'Rosebud', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'importance', 'art-value', 'movie', 'along', 'hardly', 'leaving', 'room', 'entertainment.Part', 'intentional', 'used', 'great', 'effect', 'movie', 'failure', 'regardless', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'watch', 'begun', 'end', 'No', 'Trespassing', 'One', 'problem', 'modern', 'audiences', 'may', 'definitely', 'have', 'understanding', 'film', ""n't"", 'even', 'pretend', 'answer', 'own', 'mystery', 'so-called', 'revelation', 'end', 'exploration', 'film', 'where', 'exploration', 'finale', 'goal', 'perfection', 'failure', 'theme', 'movie', 'audience', 'just', 'as', 'empty', 'characters', 'then', 'what', 'audience', 'supposed', 'do', 'Thus', 'matter', 'approach', 'film', 'should', 'be', 'seen', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'have', 'be', 'appreciated', 'worthy', 'place', 'critically-acclaimed', 'classic', 'yet', 'still', 'debatable', 'worth', 'it.As', 'DVD', 'very', 'good', 'transfer', 'especially', 'required', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'finally', 'hear', 'why', 'exactly', 'bad', 'singer', 'can', 'hear', 'whispered', 'death-word', 'more', 'expressionist', 'techniques', 'are', 'revealed', 'Commentary', 'tracks', 'are', 'interesting', 'enough', 'suppose', 'documentary', 'much', 'more', 'time', 'seeing', 'importance', 'movie', 'having', 'anybody', 'getting', 'too', 'nostalgic', 'film', 'proper.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A

297631,A2E3IB2ZHJ7QXJ,6302135621,Private Quentin Tarantino Fan,"[4, 4]","For all the baggage that Citizen Kane is bagged with, it's pretty remarkable that underneath, the hype (Citizen Kane tops the list of AFI's greatest films of all time, on both editions), the hate, and opposing view points about it, Citizen Kane is really a good movie.  Make no mistake, in my opinion, Citizen Kane is not the best movie of all time, but that's not it's fault some people scrutnize it because of those biased film geeks at the American Film Institure (though it certainly has more of it's virtues than a magazine like Rolling Stone does) It is one of the most innovative films, however, and I won't deny the importance of the movie.  The good thing about all this is that the movie is still a great movie, and has a good story, and the filmmaking and artistic quality is still very good.  Here's why I think so.Personally, I don't think the film making in this movie is a product of it's time. While it's not as fresh as it must have been when it was first released, it's still has artistic quality and has some of the coolest shots still worth looking at years later.  The Rosebud shot, the opener, the noirish look, the scene with the mirrors, even the art direction in this movie is great.  Cinematographer Gregg Toland deserved an Oscar for his work (of course he didn't), as it's as incredible to hear about the details from the commentary from Roger Ebert (this man is a film critic, he knows a ton about film that idiots like Ben Lyons and Gene Shalit only wish they did).  The acting is great, and it's hard to believe that Welles was able to pull off both young and old Kane (the make up was responsible for the old, and that was even influential), convincing no less.  It always feels like a meticolously crafted film, and it pretty much is.  The only potential thing that could be considered dated in some eyes is the black and white and 1941 production standards, which to me don't even matter much.  Everything else looks as fresh as it did in 1941.Citizen Kane is basically a pastiche of William Randolph Hearst, a newspaper king who apparently did not like this movie because it portrayed him in a negative light.  Regarding it's meaning, the message may be obvious for a lot of people.  And no, it doesn't rely on the symbolism.  I sort of agree with Ray Carney on the symbolism part, which is nice, but not really a profound statement.  Symbolism to me is more like a cool footnote, and if it's done tastefully, it works merely well. (that can't be said for the millions of mediocre student films that say nothing, except they are slathered with pretentious symbolism).  Citizen Kane is both of the previously mentioned.  However, I do not find the scene where he finds the globe to be symbolism.  I've seen objects before that totally transfix me and take me back to my younger days, I don't know, but it does.  The object isn't the focus, the way he reacts to the object is the focus.Rather, I think Citizen Kane is loss of pureness, or idealism.  Kane wanted to help other people because he's truly believed it in the beginning, but gradually became selfish, empty.  Kane is just a representation of just how many things can be reduced from their good intentions to emptiness.  Look at the concepts of free will, individualism, love, and personal fullfillment.  All of these things are pure when taken in the right mind, but all of these have been robbed and dumbed down into general fakeness (the government, marketing, music, movies, even people themselves) and used to push buttons, sell products, and trick people into believing the fakeness is actually genuine.  At a most basic level though, it shows that money indeed doesn't buy happiness, and you have to be internally motivated, and for good reasons.  There's nothing more enriching than good relationships (with the right people) and genuine care,  and if we give in to greed and fakeness, we could end up just like Kane.  That's my take on the meaning of Citizen Kane.Is Citizen Kane, in my opinion, the best film of all time?  It's definitely the most influential, and maybe it deserves the greatest title as a monument kind of stature, but it will never be among my favorite films of all time.  And that' mostly the difference here. It will never be a personal favorite to me, but Citizen Kane, for the right camp (I am in that camp), will satisfy mightily.  Please ignore everyone else and whatever anybody tells you and like it for how you like it.  There is no other way in life in figuring out what you like.",5,Still one of the Best Movies Ever Made,1242172800,"05 13, 2009",2009,4512,"['baggage', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'bagged', 'pretty', 'remarkable', 'underneath', 'hype', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'list', 'AFI', 'greatest', 'films', 'time', 'editions', 'hate', 'opposing', 'view', 'points', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Make', 'mistake', 'opinion', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'not', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'not', 'fault', 'people', 'scrutnize', 'biased', 'film', 'geeks', 'American', 'Film', 'Institure', 'certainly', 'more', 'virtues', 'magazine', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'one', 'most', 'innovative', 'films', 'however', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'importance', 'movie', 'good', 'thing', 'movie', 'still', 'great', 'movie', 'good', 'story', 'filmmaking', 'artistic', 'quality', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'Here', 'why', 'think', 'so.Personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'making', 'movie', 'product', 'time', 'not', 'as', 'fresh', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'still', 'artistic', 'quality', 'coolest', 'shots', 'still', 'looking', 'years', 'later', 'Rosebud', 'shot', 'opener', 'noirish', 'look', 'scene', 'mirrors', 'even', 'art', 'direction', 'movie', 'great', 'Cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'work', 'course', 'did', ""n't"", 'as', 'incredible', 'hear', 'details', 'commentary', 'Roger', 'Ebert', 'man', 'film', 'critic', 'ton', 'film', 'idiots', 'Ben', 'Lyons', 'Gene', 'Shalit', 'only', 'wish', 'did', 'acting', 'great', 'hard', 'believe', 'Welles', 'was', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'young', 'old', 'Kane', 'make', 'up', 'was', 'responsible', 'old', 'was', 'even', 'influential', 'convincing', 'less', 'always', 'meticolously', 'crafted', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'only', 'potential', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'dated', 'eyes', 'black', 'white', '1941', 'production', 'standards', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'matter', 'much', 'Everything', 'else', 'as', 'fresh', 'did', '1941.Citizen', 'Kane', 'basically', 'pastiche', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'newspaper', 'king', 'who', 'apparently', 'did', 'not', 'movie', 'portrayed', 'negative', 'light', 'Regarding', 'meaning', 'message', 'may', 'be', 'obvious', 'lot', 'people', ""n't"", 'rely', 'symbolism', 'sort', 'agree', 'Ray', 'Carney', 'symbolism', 'part', 'nice', 'not', 'really', 'profound', 'statement', 'Symbolism', 'more', 'cool', 'footnote', 'done', 'tastefully', 'merely', 'well', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'millions', 'mediocre', 'student', 'films', 'say', 'nothing', 'are', 'slathered', 'pretentious', 'symbolism', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'However', 'do', 'not', 'find', 'scene', 'where', 'globe', 'be', 'symbolism', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'objects', 'totally', 'transfix', 'take', 'back', 'younger', 'days', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'object', ""n't"", 'focus', 'way', 'object', 'focus.Rather', 'think', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'loss', 'pureness', 'idealism', 'Kane', 'wanted', 'help', 'other', 'people', 'truly', 'believed', 'beginning', 'gradually', 'became', 'selfish', 'empty', 'Kane', 'just', 'representation', 'just', 'how', 'many', 'things', 'can', 'be', 'reduced', 'good', 'intentions', 'emptiness', 'Look', 'concepts', 'free', 'will', 'individualism', 'love', 'personal', 'fullfillment', 'things', 'are', 'pure', 'when', 'taken', 'right', 'mind', 'have', 'been', 'robbed', 'dumbed', 'down', 'general', 'fakeness', 'government', 'marketing', 'music', 'movies', 'even', 'people', 'used', 'push', 'buttons', 'sell', 'products', 'trick', 'people', 'believing', 'fakeness', 'actually', 'genuine', 'most', 'basic', 'level', 'money', 'indeed', ""n't"", 'buy', 'happiness', 'have', 'be', 'internally', 'motivated', 'good', 'reasons', 'nothing', 'more', 'enriching', 'good', 'relationships', 'right', 'people', 'genuine', 'care', 'give', 'greed', 'fakeness', 'could', 'end', 'up', 'just', 'Kane', 'take', 'meaning', 'Citizen', 'Kane.Is', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'opinion', 'best', 'film', 'time', 'definitely', 'most', 'influential', 'maybe', 'greatest', 'title', 'monument', 'kind', 'stature', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'films', 'time', 'mostly', 'difference', 'here', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'personal', 'favorite', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'right', 'camp', 'am', 'camp', 'will', 'satisfy', 'mightily', 'Please', 'everyone', 'else', 'anybody', 'like', 'how', 'other', 'way', 'life', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'like']",N/A

When ""Citizen Kane"" topped the list of the 100 best American movies of all time, there were a few critics of a choice that many felt did not appeal to the majority of American movie-goers.  Fair enough although ""Citizen Kane"" certainly has a story that is a lot easier to follow and enjoy that most of the ""artistic"" movies of the last century. It does seem to slow down at times but this is one of those movies that reveals more and more about itself each time you view it.It is as though the puzzle of the movie is also a puzzle for the movie audience.  What did Kane mean by the dying word, ""Rosebud""?  Well, everyone who saw it through to the end certainly got a big clue but did that really tell everything there is or was it just a big hint to the larger story hidden in the movie itself?  As we watch the reporter trying to find the answers, we can see inside the story to the many insights hidden throughout the film.  Every time we see it again, the picture becomes clearer.  It isn't just that Kane wanted his childhood back; in many ways he was reliving his childhood as an adult with bigger toys but just as much enthusiasm.  It isn't just that he wanted love that was real; it was clear that he was unable to handle the love he received.  It is a far more complex picture that we have before us than most of us comprehend the first time or two through the reels.  Perhaps it is best to leave it at its' simpler messages but that is to miss the appreciation for the intentional complexity given it by its' creator, Orson Welles.There are many examples beyond just the story itself as to why ""Citizen Kane"" is such a classic; the camera angles and perspectives, to name one.  However, as much as I appreciate the cinematic innovations, I am fascinated by the story and the many insights to life itself that are revealed in this classic.  This is not necessarily a movie I stop at if I come across it while changing channels.  Sometimes I'm just not up for it, preferring, instead, something lighter for my tired mind.  However, when I want to appreciate just how well all the elements of a great movies can come together in near perfection, I chose to watch ""Citizen Kane"".

Look for brilliant compositions at every turn, particularly when the young Kane is taken from his home by Thatcher and in the night club where Susan Alexander performs.

But has anyone ever commented until now that in addition to being an examination of the title character, CITIZEN KANE contains a devastating, damning commentary on the basic idiocy of most ""investigative"" reporters - in this case the ""truth""-seeking Thompson.  But was it intentional - or a script oversight - that when Raymond the Butler is giving his two cents worth (in his case actually a thousand bucks worth!) to the meaning of Rosebud.....Thompson - a basic idiot-in-the-shadows (is this then why he is always in shadows?  To show he is the man-in-the-dark...the man who cannot see what is before him? Who can't even do his job well!) - when Thompson is told by Raymond that Kane utters the word ""Rosebud"" both when Susan left him and he pocketed ""something"" and ""that other time"" when he dropped the glass ball - yet Thompson does NOT even ask what the hell the glass ball was! If he had known it was of a snow scene he might have had the wits to trace it back to young Kane's winter of discontent when the bank seized hold of him and stole him from his beloved sleigh.  How dumb could one get?  (Perhaps as dumb as many investigative reporters are who fail to deliver the goods or come up with erroneous nonsense that they pass off as truth - or WMDs?) Anyway - I will forever wonder if Thompson's not picking up the ""ball""(in this case albeit a glass, smashed one) was intentional by the makers of KANE or was Thompson just tired at the end of the day or was this a script glitch?  Also not mentioned - to my knowledge - is the preponderance of fireplaces in the film...leading up to the end one which consumes the secret for all time.  (Notice the fireplace directly behind the young Kane when he is given a new sleigh by Thatcher - portent of things to come.)  One other thing that I have never seen mentioned in commentaries of the film is this:  the great Kane-as-a-boy snow scene....the snowman....it is a forecast of the endless statues that the elder Kane will collect; plus...it somewhat looks like the bald-domed, fatter Kane when we last see him: in the Colorado scene we thereby have child and future man, together.  The fact that a snowman is frozen- as Kane is emotionally frozen (especially at the end of the film after Susan leaves) is another point to be considered. So when we first see the dying Kane he God-like holds his past world in his hand, yet being a limited human being afterall (despite Kane's seeming unlimitness of power and money, etc) he cannot enter the scene in the ball...just like he cannot return to that moment in Time.  Conversely, when we first see Kane as a boy, he is in the world of the glass ball - but that world is also about to be shattered by the adults who plot his future within the confines of the warm boarding house. It is then - from this interior - that we see child Kane framed...as he is also about to  be ""framed"" for a crime he did not commit and sentenced to a life of wealth and riches he never asked for - or may have ever even wanted.  In both cases, however, the dying Kane at the film's opening and the first time we see K as a child - in both instances, he is....alone.  Existentially alone in a frozen world that only the human heart and hearthside can warm. One last thing to anyone familiar with the music of Rachmaninoff:  listen to his magnificent tone poem ""Isle of the Dead"" and you will hear what is essentially the Kane motif throughout it.  I absolutely love the music of Bernard Herrmann but cannot help thinking he was influenced - however subconsciously - by Rachmaninoff's piece.  Even the painting that Rachmaninoff based his tone poem on is reminiscent of Xanadu, somewhat.  Anyway - CITIZEN KANE is the ultimate film about ALL of us....not just powerful, multimillionaire publishers....but ALL of us...because we ALL have a ""Rosebud"" in our souls and minds that will be on our lips when the curtain closes.  ""Rosebud"" is, in its most basic form, the desire we all share to....start again, conquer Time, turn back the clock and NOT have die and end our dreams or our bodies.  This is what ultimately makes KANE....a CITIZEN.",5,KANE is great...but Thompson is a moron!!!,1202601600,"02 10, 2008",2008,4252,"['Yes', 'great', 'film', 'perhaps', 'greatest', 'myriad', 'reasons', 'many', 'know', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'should', 'excitedly', 'discover', 'own', 'anyone', 'ever', 'commented', 'now', 'addition', 'being', 'examination', 'title', 'character', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'devastating', 'damning', 'commentary', 'basic', 'idiocy', 'most', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'case', 'truth', '-seeking', 'Thompson', 'was', 'intentional', 'script', 'oversight', 'when', 'Raymond', 'Butler', 'giving', 'two', 'cents', 'worth', 'case', 'actually', 'thousand', 'meaning', 'Rosebud', '..Thompson', 'basic', 'idiot-in-the-shadows', 'then', 'why', 'always', 'shadows', 'show', 'man-in-the-dark', 'man', 'who', 'can', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'Who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'do', 'job', 'well', 'when', 'Thompson', 'told', 'Raymond', 'Kane', 'word', 'Rosebud', 'when', 'Susan', 'left', 'pocketed', 'something', 'other', 'time', 'when', 'dropped', 'glass', 'ball', 'yet', 'Thompson', 'NOT', 'even', 'ask', 'what', 'hell', 'glass', 'ball', 'was', 'had', 'known', 'was', 'snow', 'scene', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'wits', 'trace', 'back', 'young', 'Kane', 'winter', 'discontent', 'when', 'bank', 'seized', 'hold', 'stole', 'beloved', 'sleigh', 'How', 'dumb', 'could', 'one', 'get', 'Perhaps', 'as', 'dumb', 'many', 'investigative', 'reporters', 'are', 'who', 'fail', 'deliver', 'goods', 'come', 'up', 'erroneous', 'nonsense', 'pass', 'off', 'truth', 'WMDs', 'Anyway', 'will', 'forever', 'wonder', 'Thompson', 'not', 'picking', 'up', 'ball', 'case', 'glass', 'smashed', 'one', 'was', 'intentional', 'makers', 'KANE', 'was', 'Thompson', 'just', 'tired', 'end', 'day', 'was', 'script', 'glitch', 'Also', 'not', 'mentioned', 'knowledge', 'preponderance', 'fireplaces', 'film', 'leading', 'up', 'end', 'one', 'secret', 'time', 'Notice', 'fireplace', 'directly', 'young', 'Kane', 'when', 'given', 'new', 'sleigh', 'Thatcher', 'portent', 'things', 'come', 'One', 'other', 'thing', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'mentioned', 'commentaries', 'film', 'great', 'Kane-as-a-boy', 'snow', 'scene', '.the', 'snowman', '.it', 'forecast', 'endless', 'elder', 'Kane', 'will', 'collect', 'somewhat', 'bald-domed', 'fatter', 'Kane', 'when', 'last', 'see', 'Colorado', 'scene', 'thereby', 'have', 'child', 'future', 'man', 'together', 'fact', 'snowman', 'frozen-', 'Kane', 'emotionally', 'frozen', 'especially', 'end', 'film', 'Susan', 'leaves', 'point', 'be', 'considered', 'So', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'dying', 'Kane', 'God-like', 'past', 'world', 'hand', 'yet', 'being', 'limited', 'human', 'being', 'afterall', 'Kane', 'seeming', 'unlimitness', 'power', 'money', 'etc', 'can', 'not', 'enter', 'scene', 'ball', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'return', 'moment', 'Time', 'Conversely', 'when', 'first', 'see', 'Kane', 'boy', 'world', 'glass', 'ball', 'world', 'also', 'be', 'shattered', 'adults', 'who', 'plot', 'future', 'confines', 'warm', 'boarding', 'house', 'then', 'interior', 'see', 'child', 'Kane', 'framed', 'also', 'be', 'framed', 'crime', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'sentenced', 'life', 'wealth', 'riches', 'never', 'asked', 'may', 'have', 'ever', 'even', 'wanted', 'cases', 'however', 'dying', 'Kane', 'film', 'opening', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'K', 'child', 'instances', '.alone', 'Existentially', 'alone', 'frozen', 'world', 'only', 'human', 'heart', 'hearthside', 'can', 'warm', 'One', 'last', 'thing', 'anyone', 'familiar', 'music', 'Rachmaninoff', 'listen', 'magnificent', 'tone', 'poem', 'Isle', 'Dead', 'will', 'hear', 'what', 'essentially', 'Kane', 'motif', 'absolutely', 'love', 'music', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'thinking', 'was', 'influenced', 'however', 'subconsciously', 'Rachmaninoff', 'piece', 'Even', 'painting', 'Rachmaninoff', 'based', 'tone', 'poem', 'reminiscent', 'Xanadu', 'somewhat', 'Anyway', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'ultimate', 'film', 'ALL', 'just', 'powerful', 'multimillionaire', 'publishers', '.but', 'have', 'Rosebud', 'souls', 'minds', 'will', 'be', 'lips', 'when', 'curtain', 'Rosebud', 'most', 'basic', 'form', 'desire', 'share', '.start', 'again', 'conquer', 'Time', 'turn', 'back', 'clock', 'NOT', 'have', 'die', 'end', 'dreams', 'bodies', 'what', 'ultimately', 'KANE', '.a', 'CITIZEN']",N/A

movie and reflecting I can only envision one man that could ever had played this part to perfection and that was Orson Welles himself.This movie is as much autobiographical as it is biographical,that is there is as much Welles in this picture as Hearst.From what little I have read on both subjects over the years it is amazing how much these two men had in common in real life in their personalities and their subsequent dealings in whatever concerns were of most importance to them at any given moment.It was almost art imitating life imitating art.But in 1941 both came together in one glorious time which would never be repeated.The picture earned Welles and company I believe around 10 OSCARS(if memory serves) of which only one was issued denying Welles his just due.Hearst had won the battle but in the end Welles won the war.On further reflection another thing that very much jumped out at me as I viewed this film was the cinematograpy.The camera work was phenomenal.The lighting,the angles and the placement of shots added totally to the entire feel and execution of this picture.And another aspect that I noticed was the editing.Of course as Welles controlled just about every aspect of the picture this,I would assume,could also be laid at his feet.But take for example a scene which involves Kane and his first wife.It lasts about five minutes in all but it shows them sitting at either end of a large table.Through several dissolves we see Kane and his wife going from a newly happily married couple to two distant and cold individuals.Brilliantly done.Technically this picture has been cleaned to perfection.It is a fine transfer.There are two discs here,one has the movie along with clips from the original trailer and opening night,a short interview with a co-star and two different commentaries.The second contains a special which(again) I only saw part of a few years back on PBS called:""The Battle for Citizen Kane"",which was part of the American Experience series.You will notice that this disc alone is for sale so it is worth every penny to be included in this set.All in all I highly recommend this set to everyone.I have really no complaints in any department.While I don't think this is THE greatest movie ever made,I do believe it is one of the most important and best ever done.And when you compare it to some of the best works ever to come out

297647,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,6302135621,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[7, 7]","Citizen Kane (Orson Welles, 1941)Gather together one hundred professional film critics. You can mix and match them in any way you like, from any country in the world and from any period of time after World War II. Ask them what the best movie ever made is. While there are very few things about which film critics agree, this is one of them: the choice by the overwhelming majority of your mix-and-match set of film critics will be Citizen Kane. (The website They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? actually does this, except with, as I write this, 1,365 critics. I don't need to tell you what the outcome is, do I?) That said, faced with actually seeing a film so widely regarded as the best ever made, the average Goat is going to have one of two reactions: either ""hey, wow, they're right!"" or ""what's all the hype about?""Well, I'm your average Goat. And I have to say, I can see what all the hype is about, as long as I turn my head and squint just right. I like Pauline Kael's quote about it: ""it's the most fun you'll ever have watching a great movie."" Now there's a sentiment I can get behind.Welles' masterpiece is great not just because of the movie itself-- which Welles wrote, produced, and directed at the tender age of twenty-six (by contrast, Muranu was thirty-four when he directed Nosferatu, Romero twenty-nine at the time of Night of the Living Dead, Riefenstahl thirty-three at the time of Triumph des Willens)-- but because of the politics surrounding it. I won't even begin to attempt to get into that here; the American Experience documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane (thoughtfully included with the 2005 Warner two-disc set) is longer than the film itself. See The Battle Over Citizen Kane soon after seeing the movie itself to get some perspective.Note: here be spoilers. I assume the majority of those reading this, even those who haven't seen the film, already know the whole ""Rosebud"" shtick, but I'll warn you about spoilers anyway.The plot: a media tycoon, Charles Foster Kane (Welles), dies of old age. His last word: ""Rosebud."" A newsreel crew working on a ten-minute film of his life wants to find out what he meant, and the rest of the film is members of the crew talking to Kane's friends and intimates, trying to track down the meaning of that word. They never do. Through the omniscience of the camera, we find out that ""Rosebud"" was the name of the sled Kane had as a child growing up poor in Wyoming, and that no one else will ever know this; the sled itself is burned by junk dealers as the closing credits roll.Now, here's the thing. The legions of folks who say ""it's just a sled!"" missed the entire point, and that's how Welles sets the whole thing up. Everything from the early scene of Welles in Wyoming (in which, of course, Rosebud plays a minor role) to the final moment of the film is a red herring. Which leads you to one of two conclusions: either the mystery is secondary to Kane's life in Welles' vision, or Welles would go to any length to pull a fast one. (I lean towards the second hypothesis.) It's a fun red herring, to be sure; after the screening of the newsreel itself, which takes up the first ten minutes of Citizen Kane (and they are the slowest in the movie), it rollocks and bounces along making just as much fun of itself as it does of the larger-than-life Charles Foster Kane. And it does make fun of Kane; why else would they portray a media tycoon longing, on his deathbed, for his penniless existence in the middle of nowhere? But the claws are always at least covered in velvet; it's an affectionate sort of savagery, if such a thing is possible. No one the film crew talks to is overly fond of Kane, and some outright hate him; all, however, are forced to admit to at least grudging respect for the man. Now, think about that for a moment (and think about the fact that Welles himself is playing the object of all this scorn); there's a whole lot of emotional layering going on here. Solid stuff for a twenty-six-year-old kid.Welles had a grand vision for this movie, and, given complete freedom by the studio, he realized it. He did, in fact, make a great movie. Even with all the perspective, all the historical facts, all the mulling it over for weeks and realizing the depth of the script coupled with the incredible acting talent, pitch-perfect production, etc., though, I'm not even sure it's my favorite Welles movie. (I have a soft spot for The Stranger, the Welles that never pops up on anyone's thousand-best list, much less hundred-best.) Yes, it's a fantastic piece of work, an absolute must-see, a thoroughly enjoyable ride through the mind of one of the finest directors to ever work inside (or outside) the Hollywood machine. And it's possible that no movie ever made could live up to the hype to which this one has been subjected. It's genius, yes. But the best movie ever made? See it, and decide for yourself. **** ",5,What else is there to say?

For the most part, if they can sit through them, they jokingly tolerate my efforts to infuse some culture into their daily consumption of electronic media.  But this film held their attention and they had plenty of questions about it.  I regard this as a mini-triumph, but then, it is easier to do with a film that is this good.For myself, it was also an almost completely new viewing experience:  this time, rather than a personal history about the loss of love, I saw it from an historical perspective that I lacked as a youth.  In that way, with the overt references to WR Hearst - the rise of yellow journalism, overt meddling in politics and even international relations, and the manufacture of news - it was doubly fascinating for all of us.Still, the sadness of Kane's plight comes through with perfect clarity, indeed as perfect drama.  It utterly riveted me, was even painful to watch most of the time.  I even liked the level of psychological depth in all the characters.

297649,A16QODENBJVUI1,6302135621,Robert Moore,"[4, 5]","Citizen Kane is rightfully regarded as one of the great films in the history of the cinema, if not the greatest.  Orson Welles, the boy wonder of the New York stage, made the greatest screen debut ever in directing and starring in this amazing film.  Although some critics have tried to minimize Welles&#65533;s contribution to the film by pointing out that the movie as filmed by Welles was enormously faithful to the brilliant original screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz.  No doubt the original script played a major role in the success of the film, though it should also be pointed out that the film was graced by major talents at every point.  The score was by Bernard Hermann, considered by many to be the greatest composer for cinema (Pyscho, North by Northwest,  and Taxi Driver were just three of his other films), while cinematographer Gregg Toland even before Citizen Kane had already established himself as one of the masters of his discipline, and Robert Wise was a celebrated editor before embarking on a highly successful career as a director.  But despite all the talent, Welles managed to outshine them all, and make his mark on this film as few individuals ever have.  Although utterly inexperienced in cinema, Welles managed one visually brilliant moment after another.  Having a cinematographer of the quality of Toland helped enormously, in that he could help Welles translate his vision into film.  The scene where adults decide the future of a young Kane whose playing in the snow is framed by a window in the background is a brilliant but impossible shot, but it packs a visual wallop.  Or the scene in which Kane and other characters are filmed from below ground level, with the camera being place in a hole in the floor shows that even in his first film Welles was trying to go beyond his predecessors.Welles was not the only cinematic neophyte working on the film.  Many of the key performers in the cast had not worked in film before, but had been members of Welles&#65533;s Mercury Theater.  The cast is impeccable, and because so many went on to long careers in cinema and TV it is hard to remember that at the time they were virtually all unknowns.Yet, despite all its greatness, Citizen Kane is in the end an emotionally unengaging film.  The viewer never gets close to Charles Foster Kane, and while our hearts go out to the little boy who is separated from his &#65533;Rosebud,&#65533; they don&#65533;t linger with him.  Not just Kane, but all of the characters feel remote from the viewer.  Kane strikes us, in the end, more as victimizer than victim, and one feels that whatever bad things have happened to him were more a result of his actions than anything that was done to him.  In the end, I find Citizen Kane easier to admire and respect than to love and cherish.  The greatest film of all time?  Possibly.  The most moving?  By no means.My favorite moment in the film contains perhaps my favorite line in all cinema.  Mr. Bernstein, played by Everett Sloane, is reminded by a reporter that in the early days of Kane&#65533;s career they made a lot of money, to which he replies, &#65533;Yes, we made a lot of money.  But there&#65533;s no trick to making a lot of money, if all you want to do it make a lot of money.&#65533;",5,Lays legitimate claim to title of Greatest Film Ever Made,1047513600,"03 13, 2003",2003,3266,"['Citizen', 'Kane', 'rightfully', 'regarded', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'history', 'cinema', 'not', 'greatest', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'boy', 'wonder', 'New', 'York', 'stage', 'made', 'greatest', 'screen', 'debut', 'ever', 'directing', 'starring', 'amazing', 'film', 'critics', 'have', 'tried', 'minimize', 'Welles', '65533', 's', 'contribution', 'film', 'pointing', 'out', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Welles', 'was', 'enormously', 'faithful', 'brilliant', 'original', 'screenplay', 'Herman', 'J.', 'Mankiewicz', 'No', 'doubt', 'original', 'script', 'played', 'major', 'role', 'success', 'film', 'should', 'also', 'be', 'pointed', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'graced', 'major', 'talents', 'point', 'score', 'was', 'Bernard', 'Hermann', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'greatest', 'composer', 'cinema', 'Pyscho', 'North', 'Northwest', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'were', 'just', 'three', 'other', 'films', 'cinematographer', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'even', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'one', 'masters', 'discipline', 'Robert', 'Wise', 'was', 'celebrated', 'editor', 'embarking', 'highly', 'successful', 'career', 'director', 'talent', 'Welles', 'managed', 'outshine', 'make', 'mark', 'film', 'few', 'individuals', 'ever', 'have', 'utterly', 'inexperienced', 'cinema', 'Welles', 'managed', 'one', 'visually', 'brilliant', 'moment', 'Having', 'cinematographer', 'quality', 'Toland', 'helped', 'enormously', 'could', 'help', 'Welles', 'translate', 'vision', 'film', 'scene', 'where', 'adults', 'decide', 'future', 'young', 'Kane', 'playing', 'snow', 'framed', 'window', 'background', 'brilliant', 'impossible', 'shot', 'visual', 'wallop', 'scene', 'Kane', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'filmed', 'ground', 'level', 'camera', 'being', 'place', 'hole', 'floor', 'even', 'first', 'film', 'Welles', 'was', 'trying', 'go', 'predecessors.Welles', 'was', 'not', 'only', 'cinematic', 'neophyte', 'working', 'film', 'Many', 'key', 'performers', 'cast', 'had', 'not', 'worked', 'film', 'had', 'been', 'members', 'Welles', '65533', 's', 'Mercury', 'Theater', 'cast', 'impeccable', 'so', 'many', 'went', 'long', 'careers', 'cinema', 'TV', 'hard', 'remember', 'time', 'were', 'virtually', 'unknowns.Yet', 'greatness', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'end', 'emotionally', 'unengaging', 'film', 'viewer', 'never', 'close', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'hearts', 'go', 'out', 'little', 'boy', 'who', 'separated', '65533', 'Rosebud', '65533', 'don', '65533', 't', 'linger', 'Not', 'just', 'Kane', 'characters', 'feel', 'remote', 'viewer', 'Kane', 'end', 'more', 'victimizer', 'victim', 'one', 'feels', 'bad', 'things', 'have', 'happened', 'were', 'more', 'result', 'actions', 'anything', 'was', 'done', 'end', 'find', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'easier', 'admire', 'respect', 'love', 'cherish', 'greatest', 'film', 'time', 'Possibly', 'most', 'moving', 'means.My', 'favorite', 'moment', 'film', 'perhaps', 'favorite', 'line', 'cinema', 'Mr.', 'Bernstein', 'played', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'reminded', 'reporter', 'early', 'days', 'Kane', '65533', 's', 'career', 'made', 'lot', 'money', '65533', 'Yes', 'made', 'lot', 'money', '65533', 's', 'trick', 'making', 'lot', 'money', 'want', 'do', 'make', 'lot', 'money.', '65533']",N/A

It has been 62 years since its release and yet it remains one of the most interesting, indeed compelling films ever made. It was directed by Orson Welles who also plays the lead role of Charles Foster Kane. William Randolph Hearst presumably served as the model for Kane. (I have no interest in getting into all that now. Others have already discussed quite thoroughly the film's historical context and have much of value to say about it. The comments which follow are limited entirely to the film itself.) Perhaps only directors and cinematographers can fully appreciate Welles' technical achievements in this film. Even 62 years later, I am still fascinated by the analysis of Kane personality, especially as it is revealed in his relationships with various associates over several decades. His intelligence is formidable, his charm almost irresistible and yet....Most of us have an indelible childhood memory or association. For Kane, it is ""Rosebud,"" the last word he spoke before dying. Those who view this film accompany reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) as he seeks to understand the meaning of Kane's last word. We learn that  Kane  was relinquished as a child by his parents (Agnes Moorehead and Harry Shannon) after he becomes the heir to a substantial fortune; his conflicts with his guardian, Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris); his impetuous decision to run a newspaper with the help of schoolmate Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten) and loyal assistant Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane) because it would be ""fun""; his emergence from scandal sheet publisher to the owner of America's largest and most influential newspaper chain; his marriage to socially prominent Emily Norton (Ruth Warrick), whose uncle is the President of the United States; then Kane's bid for public office which is dashed along with his marriage when his opponent, corrupt political boss Jim Gettys (Ray Collins), reveals that Kane is having an affair with aspiring vocalist Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore); Kane's futile attempts to promote his second wife as an opera star; and his final, self-imposed exile to a massive but incomplete palace called ""Xanadu.""Thompson conscientiously attempts to reconstruct Kane's life as best he can but even so, there are so many unanswered questions as the film ends. What does Kane make of his childhood? When was he happiest? Why embarrass and abandon Emily, a decent and devoted wife? Why did he decide to spend what remained of his life with Susan Alexander? As he lay dying, did he feel that his life (everything considered) was a success? I have thought about these and other questions a great deal and am dissatisfied with my responses to them. No doubt that explains why this film continues to attract and then frustrate me...and perhaps others.

Orson Welles gives a spectacular performance as do Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, Agnes Moorehead and Ruth Warrick.

Orson Welles came to Hollywood, a fervent, raging 24 year old theater and radio prodigy with no film background whatever.  He created in one film a tragedy meant to be larger in scope and power than any Shakespeare play, a film that would draw on the human need to piece together someone from stories and recollections (a non linear narrative- no film had ever been made in this way before), a film that would use every cinematic device available to tell it's story.  No studio ever gave a new director (or any director) this much power, and never had any new director seized on a such a complete vision for how to make a film in such a new way.  The script by Herman Mankiewicz used the life of newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst as it's main body, and this ignited a terrible battle of wills between Welles and Hearst. The included documentary 'the battle over Citizen Kane' is crucial in understanding these 2 men. Because the ultimate irony here is that the message of the lone businessman who runs off everyone in his search for love is really not Hearst's story at all, but Welles'. Welles lost all his clout, sank into obscurity, became an industry joke, and died. He became the bitter recluse, his onscreen creation.

Taken in isolation or in the historical context this is one movie that works just about way you look at it.  Welles' best?  Matter of debate, but it is undeniablely one of the masterworks of cinema.  It is a brillant film in structure, techinque, and overall emotional pull.The best part?  Well, that is an individual choice.  The print is so pristinet that you might have thought it was shot with a digital camera (well, George Lucas is no Orson Welles).  Both commentary tracks are fascinating (Ebert just won a major award for best commentary track of '01), if a bit dry.  The documentary on disk II sparked a fascination about both men (welles and Hearst) in me.  Just look at the film clips in the doc, you won't believe how amazing the new transfer is.  This entire film--the story, the script, the backstory, thefights--etc. is an important part of our history.  This preserves it.  Also, see HBO's RKO 281 about the battle.

And if you already love the film you should be in hog Heaven.Citizen Kane is the story of a man taken out of his childhood at a young age who rises to greatness by creating a great newspaper empire to become one of the most powerful and influential men in the United States. He has friends, money love and an extravagant palatial estate called Xanadu high in the hills and above the world. Eventually all the treasures of his life become corrupted and lost by his own folly, jealousy and manipulations. This once powerful man lies in solitude longing for the things he lost in his life. He dies with one final word on his lips. &quot;Rosebud&quot; A reporter eager to make a story of the great man and decides his angle will be to decipher the meaning of this final word that is a mystery even to Kane's closest friends. It is through this reporter's investigation we learn the life of Charles Foster Kane.Very few people watching the film today have any personal recollection of William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper mogul and yellow journalist upon whom the film is based. Nor are we much aware of the films being made at that time to give us a perspective on the many new innovations introduced by this film.But most of us are familiar and comfortable with Roger Ebert who gives you a walkthrough on the film in one of the two commentary tracks. And there is a two hour documentary as well as scads of interviews and extras to make you expert enough at the film to pose at any Hollywood party as the boorish film snob you have always longed to be. And maybe if you are lucky you may even decide you like the film. If not there is still one bit of drama on the DVD you are sure to enjoy and that is the original Halloween broadcast of Orson Welles &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. The radio broadcast that scared America and almost drove one woman to suicide.This DVD truly is a filmschool in a box and from what I can see, a pretty reasonable price for a double disc set.

This outlook, born out of the merciless Industrialism of the last Century has ravaged the natural resources of this land.Citizen Kane shows us what total, uncontrolled Capitalism is, and how autocratic men like this run it, making any modern day King or noble sweet by comparison.  Watch this film for its brilliant camera techniques, and for the incredible stage presence of Orson Welles, yes by all means.

With people parroting the line &#34;Citizen Kane is the best movie ever,&#34; I had to think that this movie would be WAY better than this. I suppose that this movie broke all sorts of Hollywood conventions and rewrote the Hollywood rules with its creativity, but I've got to be honest in that I'd never know the difference, growing up in the 1980s and '90s. Now that any and all innovation has worn off, I've got to judge this movie purely on its plot, characters, acting, dialogue and just the nuts and bolts of whether this is a good movie or not......and it's not. So many of the performances are embarrassingly stagey and cheesy. They don't meet modern standards of good acting. The movie also had about seven plot lines, and Welles's portrayal of Kane failed to have any gravity and was unconvincing. Kane failed to strike an image of being good or bad, and this movie ended up saying nothing, except that this guy wanted his sled back, and I didn't even care about that. I also kind of object to the overall theme: that money won't buy you happiness. The movie seems like vague socialist propaganda, and I can think of worse things than getting rich.

297664,A6FIAB28IS79,6302135621,Samuel Chell,"[19, 21]","This restoration of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is nothing short of miraculous, practically as dazzling an achievement as the film itself. It's pretty well known that the original 35mm print of &quot;Kane&quot; was lost long ago, so expectations of producing a superior duplicate from another duplicate were never very high. On the film's 50th anniversary, Turner Enterprises released a restored print for theatrical release, but though it was brighter, it had a somewhat white-washed, softy-focused aura that served neither Welles' purpose nor the &quot;film noir-ish&quot; properties of Welles' masterpiece adequately.The DVD restoration, on the other hand, has crisp, sharply-defined images, richly complex and nuanced blacks, whites and greys, and an audio track that sounds fresh and &quot;present&quot; without over-equalization of highs and lows or gratuitous stereo simulation.For some viewers, &quot;Kane&quot; ranks as the greatest film of all time because it's possible to stop the film on any single frame of its 2-hour length and produce an exegesis not only on the aesthetic and technical strengths of that individual shot but on the film as a whole, given its organic structure and the microcosmic status of each of the parts. For such viewers, this version should prove especially indispensable, affording glimpses of information--faces and other objects formerly covered by dark shadow, lap dissolves once too subtle to spot even in slow motion, competing, yet independently crucial, conversations--perhaps not accessible since the film's initial release.Even without the bonuses, the single disc would be worth the price. But the inclusion of an additional DVD, &quot;The Making of Citizen Kane,&quot; along with the historical, biographical, contextual materials included on the first disc make this package a steal.  With this many riches to choose from, viewers may be excused if they pass up the Peter Bogdanovich running commentary on the film (I couldn't stay with it for very long), but Roger Ebert's extemporary &quot;play-by-play&quot; is not merely profuse but perceptive, articulate, and edifying from the very first shot. Even his commentary during the gallery of stills, in which he explains why &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is his favorite movie and why it deserves its reputation as the best ever, is not to be missed. (I now realize that the hurried, superficial quality of much of his newpaper reviewing in recent years says more about the product than the reviewer.)One caution: The first disc, with &quot;Kane&quot; and all of the assorted contextual material that follows, initially behaved &quot;buggy&quot; on my iMac DV.

297667,A1C58YXM2A30CY,6302135621,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 2]","I got the two disc DVD set of Citizen Kane.  The film was quite controversial of the time and RKO Pictures originally was not going to play it because of the pressure put to bear by William Randolph Hearst, famous newspaper magnate and philanthropist.  Even to this day, the Hearst Corporation has its fingers in every pie:  radio, television, cable, satellite broadcasting, etc.  Hearst did not like that Orson was making what amounted to an unauthorized criticism on Hearst himself.Similarities?  Oh yes!  Although the names were changed, the film follows Hearst's life to a Tee, with a lot of creative license being taken.Orson Welles, only 24 years old, who, flushed from his success on the Mercury Theater and his famous (or infamous) broadcast, War of the Worlds, he created what many consider the best film of all time and many consider the beginning of the end of Orson's career as a radio, stage and film master of entertainment.[For those who do not know, on Halloween night back in the 1930s, with America concerned about Hitler's advances in Europe, Welles adapted H.G. Wells War of the Worlds with realistic-sounding newscasts and had the Martians invading Grover's Mill, New Jersey.  Many people actually believed these broadcasts to be REAL and panicked!  Radio was like TV is today, with soaps, westerns, news, and so on as main entertainment and so having your shows interrupted by newscasts and bulletins was common.  This created major controversy and put Orson on the map!]But back to the review:Charles Foster Kane, as a child,  is being taken away as the family can no longer have him.  His mother is played stoically by Agnes Moorhead, a strong character actress in her own right (well before ""Bewitched!"" the cheesy sitcom of the Sixties.).Kane gets a newspaper, expands his empire, builds a castle (in Florida rather than San Simeon (current location of Hearst Castle), collects art as well as pretty girls, runs for office, confronts scandal and finally dies, dropping a snow globe and whispers ""Rosebud.""Why Rosebud?  Well, the newspaper guys who are creating the news reel (News On The March!) want to know more about Kane and what Rosebud is.  The film then goes through a lot of flashbacks and personal interviews with fictional (and thinly disguised) friends of Kane to find out more about the man, his mission and what was Rosebud.Was Kane a self-seeking vampire who sucked the spirit out of everyone he came in contact with?  Or did his childhood memories still haunt him decades after the fact?Melodramatic to the extreme, some scenes were slow-paced.  The black & white photography was simply gorgeous.  And getting a peak at life as it might have been like in the early 20th Century was enjoyable and fascinating.Disc Two:  Wow, this was great.  Actual filmed interviews with Orson Welles done in the 1980s before his death.  You can see his eyes light up as he recalled the creative energy he possessed as a very young man, creating plays in Harlem with an all Black cast in creating Shakespeare for the masses.Touched on are the Mercury Theater broadcasts for CBS and the War of the Worlds broadcast.  The narrator said it best:  Orson accomplished it all at a young age and then was burned and never came back after Citizen Kane.Extensive biographical data on Welles and Hearst, both driven men, both creative geniuses in their own ways, proud and gifted and heading on a collision course with each other.""A film is never really good unless the camera is an eye in the head of a poet.""-Orson Welles""Even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit.""Orson Welles""I started at the top and worked down.""Orson WellesMore on Orson Welles:Orson Welles: Volume 1: The Road to XanaduOrson Welles: Volume 2: Hello AmericansMore on War of the Worlds Broadcast:War of the Worlds: Featuring Orson WellesThe Orson Welles' War of the Worlds ScandalMore on Willam Randolph Hearst:Citizen Hearst: A Biography of William Randolph HearstThe Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst",5,Xanadu -- Fact or Fiction?

297673,A73QPH7NGI0DJ,6302135621,Sean Curley,"[3, 3]","Alright, ""greatest movie of all time"", let's see what you've got.Anyone who sets out to review ""Citizen Kane"" with the goal of determining, on first viewing, whether it is the greatest film ever made is setting themselves up for disappointment.  It's a burden of expectations that is best set aside, insomuch as that is possible.  Reviewing ""Kane"" today poses a lot of challenges; its main plot point has been thoroughly spoiled, its technical innovations are standard by now, and it has been the subject of numerous parodies (the first I can remember seeing being an episode of ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" in the early 1990s).We open with the famous dying word of one Charles Foster Kane, media tycoon turned disappointed recluse in his vast Florida mansion.  Kane, played as an adult by Orson Welles (actor/writer/producer/director; I'm assuming he just didn't have time to edit and score it), is plucked from his poor upbringing to a life of great wealth, and enters into the newspaper business.  On his death, a reporter out to uncover the meaning of `Rosebud' interviews various people from his past:  his second ex-wife Susan (Dorothy Comingore), his longtime #2, Bernstein (Everett Sloane), and his sometimes best friend Jed Leland (Joseph Cotten).  None has any idea what `Rosebud' means, but they talk a lot about their experiences with Kane.""Citizen Kane"" is similar to the works of Theodore Dreiser, depicting the damage to the soul caused by the pursuit of money above all else.  Kane's whole life and all his relationships, public and private, are defined by trying to get people to love him, despite struggling to love anyone himself.  Kane is well-played by Welles, and supported by a group of great actors, notably ""The Third Man""'s Joseph Cotten.  The age makeup used to allow the same actors to play characters over a 50-year span is surprisingly good for the period (the black-and-white probably helps with that).  Many of ""Kane""'s technical innovations have been standardized in subsequent decades, but, having seen several other film styles from this era, one can still appreciate how this film looks.  I did find a few of the scene transitions and music a bit jarring.Recommended (really, everyone should see this film just to get a sense of it).",5,"Set aside the ""greatest"" question and just watch the film.",1264723200,"01 29, 2010",2010,2263,"['Alright', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time', 'let', 'see', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got.Anyone', 'who', 'out', 'review', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'goal', 'determining', 'first', 'viewing', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'setting', 'up', 'disappointment', 'burden', 'expectations', 'best', 'set', 'aside', 'insomuch', 'possible', 'Reviewing', 'Kane', 'today', 'lot', 'challenges', 'main', 'plot', 'point', 'been', 'thoroughly', 'spoiled', 'technical', 'innovations', 'are', 'standard', 'now', 'been', 'subject', 'numerous', 'parodies', 'first', 'can', 'remember', 'seeing', 'being', 'episode', 'Tiny', 'Toon', 'Adventures', 'early', '1990s', '.We', 'open', 'famous', 'dying', 'word', 'one', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'media', 'tycoon', 'turned', 'disappointed', 'recluse', 'vast', 'Florida', 'mansion', 'Kane', 'played', 'adult', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'actor/writer/producer/director', ""'m"", 'assuming', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'edit', 'score', 'plucked', 'poor', 'upbringing', 'life', 'great', 'wealth', 'enters', 'newspaper', 'business', 'death', 'reporter', 'uncover', 'meaning', 'Rosebud', 'various', 'people', 'past', 'second', 'ex-wife', 'Susan', 'Dorothy', 'Comingore', 'longtime', '2', 'Bernstein', 'Everett', 'Sloane', 'sometimes', 'best', 'friend', 'Jed', 'Leland', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'None', 'idea', 'what', 'Rosebud', 'means', 'talk', 'lot', 'experiences', 'Kane', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'similar', 'works', 'Theodore', 'Dreiser', 'depicting', 'damage', 'soul', 'caused', 'pursuit', 'money', 'else', 'Kane', 'whole', 'life', 'relationships', 'public', 'private', 'are', 'defined', 'trying', 'get', 'people', 'love', 'struggling', 'love', 'anyone', 'Kane', 'well-played', 'Welles', 'supported', 'group', 'great', 'actors', 'notably', 'Third', 'Man', 'Joseph', 'Cotten', 'age', 'makeup', 'used', 'allow', 'same', 'actors', 'play', 'characters', '50-year', 'span', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'period', 'black-and-white', 'probably', 'Many', 'Kane', 'technical', 'innovations', 'have', 'been', 'standardized', 'subsequent', 'decades', 'having', 'seen', 'several', 'other', 'film', 'styles', 'era', 'one', 'can', 'still', 'appreciate', 'how', 'film', 'did', 'find', 'few', 'scene', 'transitions', 'music', 'bit', 'jarring.Recommended', 'really', 'everyone', 'should', 'see', 'film', 'just', 'get', 'sense']",N/A

But I am not sure if it has aged well enough to be exalted to the level of the greatest movie of all time or anything, especially for non-American audiences.The theme veers around a (typical) rich guy who was born with a silver spoon, then gagged on it with his egotistical empire of yellow journalism, and made a spectacular, stylish mess of his life. The plot line is thus simple and predictable, the acting very convincing but not legendary. There are several quotable quotes, which may interest some viewers. Around the middle the movie exhibits a bit of chaff, long scenes where very little purposeful happens.Yet, the artistic value along with some of the &quot;scandal&quot; involved in Citizen Kane (semblance to the real life of William Hearst) is what made it a classic years later. If it is believed that this film was a trailblazer in cinematography, I can absolutely see why. It sports a dazzling kaleidescope of amazing lighting tricks and innovative camera angles (e.g., having the camera on the floor).Yet, is it THE best movie ever made?

Henkels,"[2, 3]","First, the fact that when middle aged boomers like myself were in school, the one thing we probably all knew about Orson Welles was his 1938 Radio Show WAR OF THE WORLDS, and his movie career was a very secondary thing. CITIZEN KANE is probably the most written about (see the late Pauline Kael's famous piece etc.) movie ever, but many have still not seen it,even after the mid-1980's video era began. It was rarely on TV before then. Notice the handling of the young boy with his mother in the snow storm,and his being told he'll be rich, and moving on to better things with his new guardian, and the boy's sadness,and losing the sled. Right from the start, Lord Acton's comment &quot;Money corrupts absolutely&quot;, one of the great themes thruout this incredible feast of a movie. We all know it was Welles' first chance to do his own movie, and,like Mozart, he proved himself a Boy Wonder!! The shots and narration of the &quot;Castle&quot; with all the animals. This too is a wondrous scene, but they continue all the way thru....ending only in the final scene of the fires burning and the sled marked by the famous name, the utterance of the great,but defeated, man on his death bed. All he really wanted was the innocence of youth, as the middle of the film shows his slow decline and corruption. At least that's my take on it...Other great short scenes include Kane meeting with Hitler, Mussolini (I think..I have not scene this for years, and am writing this strictly from memory.) etc. The growth of the newspaper empire is beautifully done too...Obviously, the lighting and cinematography is perfection all the way,as is the make-up and aging of Orson's own portrayal,ie from a young man to a senior,maybe 50 years of Kane's life...The only weak spot IMHO are the operatic scenes where his second wife squeals away, cheap shots at Hearst and Marion Davies..And there's the dinner table scenes with his first wife,perfectly showing the deterioration of a marriage,as they slowly begin to ignore each other (too familiar for many of us probably). Anything and everything by Welles has at least a stroke of genius, and CITIZEN KANE is one long stroke. After this don't miss the rare LADY FROM SHANGHAI,and MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. The others are all great in that special Wellesian way, but these three are the top.

It holds such power in the cinema world due to the immensity of its themes - ego, the will to power, the American Dream silver trail from poverty to immense wealth, the overarching power and instability of the media, the effect of women and men on each other. It is a contender for the Great American Movie - just like the parallel battle for Great American Novel. This is something only realy done in the USA. No one speaks of the Great British Movie, or the Great European Movie - the same paradigm just doesn't seem to appear for the more varied, fragmented film industries over here. But in America you have to strive to be the best, the greatest. Orson Welles, a fledgling director and star knew he was grappling with something immense here, and he holds true course well throughout.

297688,A29BQ6B90Y1R5F,6302135621,S. Rhodes,"[5, 6]","There are lots of movies we can argue one must see in his lifetime.  Casablanca, Ben Hur, Star Wars, The Godfather, The Wizard of Oz, Gone with Wind... just to name a few, but few stand as high on that list of ""Movies you should see at least once,"" quite like Citizen Kane.  At the time of it's release in 1941, it was hailed as one of the movies which changed the industry.  The reasons why are all but forgotten now.  So all Citizen Kane has to stand on now is it's story, acting and script.  All of which are fine.  It's a movie that has aged somewhat well over the years.  The debate over the greatest movie ever made will rage on fforever (but you mostly see Citizen Kane and Casablanca somewhere on that list).  When Citizen Kane debuted, however, it was incredibly good craftsmanship for filming.  Remember, film was fairly young at this time.  There were still a lot of things that were being played around with and experimented with in film.  Citizen Kane, upon release, was hailed as a technical achievement that, for many reasons may seem like they aren't such a big deal today.  But they WERE a big deal then.Almost everyone knows the story of Citizen Kane, but it doesn't hurt to recount it.  The story begins on Kane's death bed.  He utters one last word: ""Rosebud..."" before he dies.  Because of this, people are in question as to what Kane's last word meant.  What was the meaning behind ""Rosebud"" and who or what was it?  As people investigate, the audience is treated to Kane's life.  From being taken from his real parents to rising to being the best of the best in journalism.  And ultimately his downfall.  We see as Kane lives his life and becomes of the most iconic people in the world.  We meet several people and learn to really appreciate Kane as a character.  The movie keeps plowing forward until we the audience learn just what Rosebud really is.  It may not seem like much from the get go, but the screenplay in and of itself really plays out really well.  As we learn about Kane we're willing to be taken for a ride.  The last scene in particular--when we learn what Rosebud is--is a really fantastic scene in and of itself.Yet there were certain things about Citizen Kane that made it unique for its time.  The first is that the movie is essentially a host of flashbacks telling the story of Charles Foster Kane.  It spans so much time, but it gets through it quickly.  Again, it seems like no big deal to us, but the way Orson Welles does it is still a technique very few do.  Even though time is passing in Kane's life, we hardly get that sense.  The time periods seem to mesh together because rather than tons of hardcuts we're mostly treated to it fading through his life, sometimes even in the same room.  Another technique that was done really well that was introduced by Citizen Kane was using makeup to make the characters age.  This, of course, is still done to this day.  The final technique that was quite astounding was the film's camera work.  Again, not a big deal in this day and age, but consider that Citizen Kane truly showed people you could do things with simple cuts and edits and pan shots.  For example, being able to see everything in the background foreground etc. in sharp, clear focus.  This was pretty amazing before.  If you take film classes, I'm sure you may get someone who goes on about this.  Citizen Kane's cinematography seems to be a favorite historical fact of many film buffs.It may also seem strange that the cinematography is praised because for the first time in a shot you can see the ceiling of a home.  This is because many films didn't get filmed on location.  Seeing things like this was quite an amazing achievement when Citizen Kane came out.  To put it simply, there's historical significance to what Citizen Kane did for film.  Of course, you don't exactly think of that these days when you think of Citizen Kane.  Most of us, of course, remember ""Rosebud"" and others of us remember that first scene.  Many of us (myself included) weren't even around when Citizen Kane was the big influence it was.  Put simple, Citizen Kane was like Star Wars.  So innovative and different for its time that it sort of lives on as a result.Of course, that also means that certain things about Citizen Kane are truly forgotten.  Unless you actually study film or read up on it, those who watch Citizen Kane now might be scratching their heads wondering just what the big deal is.  Indeed Citizen Kane does have things about it which might not bode well in this day and age.  The first being that Citizen Kane just feels long.  It's a two hour long movie, but I won't lie... it's boring.  It's an amazing film that everyone should see at least once, but it can be boring.  And it has little to do with special effects (which I'm not a big fan of anyway) or anything like that.  It's because the movie just moves at a snails pace.  It takes a lot of time to really develop Mr. Kane, but a lot of it can be very boring to watch.  Yet at the same time there are many exchanges that are quite interesting to watch.  The narrative in and of itself is very good.  It's just that... like I said, it's boring.  There are times when watching that you sort of feel like asking ""Are we there yet?""  It's mostly in the middle when the film begins to drag, but as we move on, especially that last scene, the brilliance of the film's screenplay can be seen.With it's reputation of being among the greatest films ever made, it may surprise people to know that Citizen Kane didn't take home that Oscar for Best Picture.  In fact, of all the awards it was nominated for at the Academy Awards... it only won one.  For screenplay.  Despite all it's innovations in cinematography, art direction, and editing, Citizen Kane was never honored with an Oscar for any of these categories.  And when reading up on Citizen Kane you sort of get the feeling that perhaps the film was cheated out of those awards.In spite of it all, Citizen Kane is a movie worth viewing at least once if you're a big movie lover.  It's one of those movies that ought to be viewed not just for enjoyment, but perhaps for historical purposes as well.  It is nice to say that the story and narration have aged incredibly well and are still fondly influential.  It's just a shame that the innovations of Citizen Kane aren't realized in quite the same manner.",4,"""Rosebud...""",1249516800,"08 6, 2009",2009,6372,"['are', 'lots', 'movies', 'can', 'argue', 'one',

I was told then that it was one of the finest motion pictures ever made.  Upon its conclusion my shoulders dropped and I muttered, &quot;Rosebud was  a SLED??!!??&quot;  I was extremely let down.  I suppose I was accustomed  to big-budget Irwin Allen-ish productions and was numb to the subtle  artistic accomplishments of this masterpiece.  I have seen this film  perhaps fifty times and I enjoy it much more today than I ever have in the  past.  Truely, we really don't know anyone we know.

297694,A1537KCD6LBWGI,6302135621,steve_manassas,"[4, 4]","CITIZEN KANE is probably my favorite dramatic film of all time. Produced and directed by Orson Welles at age 26, just three years after his Mercury Theater On The Air production of H.G. Wells'War of the Worlds, broadcast on the Columbia Broadcasting System (no initials in those days) on October 30, 1938, actually convinced millions of Americans that Martians were invading Grovers Mill, New Jersey.Welles plays Charles Foster Kane, a ""yellow journalist"" whose life and career is closely modeled on the real-life William Randolph Hearst, who tried everything in his power to stop CITIZEN KANE from being released.  Many Hollywood studios offered to buy the negative from RKO Pictures and destroy it, but Welles refused to back down, and the film was finally released in May 1941.  Because of all the negative publicity from the Hearst newspapers and other outlets, the film, much like another 1940s classic,It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition), initially bombed at the box office.  The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, but only won one: for Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay) by Herman Mankiewicz and Orson Welles.Bernard Herrmann wrote the musical score for the film; he later went on to score the music forThe Twilight Zone: The Complete Series [Blu-ray] and many Alfred Hitchcock films, includingNorth by Northwest (Two-Disc 50th Anniversary Edition)andPsycho (Collector's Edition).  In addition, Herrmann also conducted the CBS Orchestra in THE WAR OF THE WORLDS radio broadcast, including the fictional dance-band sequences as ""Ram&oacute;n Raquello And His Orchestra"" (and later on in the broadcast, ""Bobby Millette And His Orchestra."")Re-releases in the 1950s and later exposure on television made CITIZEN KANE a cult favorite, and the American Film Institute has twice named it the best film of all time, in 1998 and 2007.Several of Welles' Mercury Theater players went on to become major stars, including Joseph Cotten, Ray Collins (who played Lieutenant Arthur Tragg in TV'sPerry Mason), Agnes Moorehead (who baby boomers remember as Endora inBewitched), and Ruth Warrick, who starred in the ABC soap ALL MY CHILDREN for over four decades.Disc 1 features the original film in excellent quality, with several bonus features, including newsreel footage of the 1941 premiere, interviews with Ruth Warrick and editor Robert Wise, who went on to direct such films asWest Side Story (Full Screen Edition)andThe Sound of Music (Three-Disc 45th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging), storyboards, still photos (with commentary by Roger Ebert), the original theatrical trailer, audio commentaries by Ebert and Peter Bogdanovich, subtitles in English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish, and audio in English, Portuguese, and Spanish.  Some of the special features listed by Amazon, such as the 10/28/1940 KTSA, San Antonio Broadcast of ""H.G. Wells Meets Orson Welles,"" and the aforementioned  10/30/1938 broadcast of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS do not appear in this edition; perhaps they are included in theCitizen Kane (Amazon Exclusive 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition + The Magnificent Ambersons on DVD) [Blu-ray].  I have the original THE WAR OF THE WORLDS broadcast on a Radio Spirits CD that I purchased years ago at Cracker Barrel, of all places.Disc 2 is a fine PBS AMERICAN EXPERIENCE documentary from 1996, THE BATTLE FOR CITIZEN KANE, which examines the parallels between the lives of Welles and Hearst.Disc 3 is an excellent 1999 HBO/WGBH biopic titled RKO 281, named after RKO's production code for the film, loosely based on the PBS documentary, which features many contemporary Hollywood stars, including Liev Schreiber (as Welles), James Cromwell, Melanie Griffith, John Malkovich, Roy Scheider, and Liam Cunningham.  CAVEAT:  Because it is an HBO film, there is a lot of strong profanity throughout, so unlike the original movie, it is not kid-friendly.The package also includes a 48-page hardcover book with photos and a brief history of the film, and a portfolio containing replicas of movie posters, studio documents, and the souvenir program that was sold to moviegoers in 1941.This Collector's Edition is worth having on either DVD or Blu-ray, but if you are on a tight budget, the film is also available in several less expensive standalone editions.",5,One of the greatest films ever made,1357516800,"01 7,

297696,AK61LQI92GTCH,6302135621,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[10, 10]","There has probably been more pearls of wisdom cast at CITIZEN KANE than any other movie.  I just did a book search on the title here on Amazon and came up with 43 results.  There are `Perspectives on,'  `Focus on,' `Casebook on' and a `Making of' or two, as well as a waggish `Raising Kane.'  Tossing out the strays - Jeffrey Archer's `Kane and Abel,' for instance -- that haven't a thing to do with Orson Welles' masterpiece, you're still left with a shelf full of books on the movie.  And that doesn't even begin to count the magazine and journal articles.So what's a rube to do?  Any `insight' I might offer on CITIZEN KANE has undoubtedly been gurgitated and regurgitated a dozen time.  The best I can come up with is this: The last time I saw this it was a cheap vhs tape and I remember disliking it quite a bit.  The Warners' Home Video disk is extremely clean and the movie benefits tremendously.  You've really got to watch a clean print of this one to appreciate it.  This will never be my favorite movie - or even my favorite Orson Welles movie - but I've watched it three times (the disk has a separate commentary track with Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Ebert) and I've seen something new in it each time.  Not just because the commentators point it out, either, although the commentaries help in appreciating the nuances of Welles' direction and Gregg Toland's camera-work.The two-hour long `The Battle Over Citizen Kane' documentary on disk two, an episode of PBS's `American Experience,' gives a welcome and complete overview of the controversy surrounding the production and distribution of the movie.  The clutch of specials on disk one - ad campaigns, call sheets, etc. - are interesting but, unlike the `Battle' on disk two, unessential.  CITIZEN KANE, however, is essential viewing for anyone with an involved interest in movies beyond the current hits.  I didn't love it, but after watching it three times in a short span I can now appreciate why it's considered by many the greatest movie ever made.",5,Citizen Kane,1122768000,"07 31, 2005",2005,2019,"['probably', 'been', 'more', 'pearls', 'wisdom', 'cast', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'other', 'movie', 'just', 'did', 'book', 'search', 'title', 'here', 'Amazon', 'came', 'up', '43', 'results', 'are', 'Perspectives', 'Focus', 'Casebook', 'Making', 'two', 'as', 'well', 'waggish', 'Raising', 'Kane', 'Tossing', 'strays', 'Jeffrey', 'Archer', 'Kane', 'Abel', 'instance', 'have', ""n't"", 'thing', 'do', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'masterpiece', ""'re"", 'still', 'left', 'shelf', 'full', 'books', 'movie', ""n't"", 'even', 'begin', 'count', 'magazine', 'journal', 'articles.So', 'what', 'rube', 'do', 'Any', 'insight', 'might', 'offer', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'undoubtedly', 'been', 'gurgitated', 'regurgitated', 'dozen', 'time', 'best', 'can', 'come', 'up', 'last', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'cheap', 'vhs', 'tape', 'remember', 'disliking', 'quite', 'bit', 'Warners', 'Home', 'Video', 'disk', 'extremely', 'clean', 'movie', 'benefits', 'tremendously', ""'ve"", 'really', 'got', 'watch', 'clean', 'print', 'one', 'appreciate', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'favorite', 'movie', 'even', 'favorite', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'three', 'times', 'disk', 'separate', 'commentary', 'track', 'Peter', 'Bogdanovich', 'Roger', 'Ebert', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'something', 'new', 'time', 'Not', 'just', 'commentators', 'point', 'out', 'either', 'commentaries', 'help', 'appreciating', 'nuances', 'Welles', 'direction', 'Gregg', 'Toland', 'camera-work.The', 'two-hour', 'long', 'Battle', 'Over', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'documentary', 'disk', 'two', 'episode', 'PBS', 'American', 'Experience', 'welcome', 'complete', 'overview', 'controversy', 'surrounding', 'production', 'distribution', 'movie', 'clutch', 'specials', 'disk', 'one', 'ad', 'campaigns', 'call', 'sheets', 'etc', 'are', 'interesting', 'Battle', 'disk', 'two', 'unessential', 'CITIZEN', 'KANE', 'however', 'essential', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'involved', 'interest', 'movies', 'current', 'hits', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'watching', 'three', 'times', 'short', 'span', 'can', 'now', 'appreciate', 'why', 'considered', 'many', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made']",N/A

Citizen Kane is a 1941 American drama film, directed by and starring Orson Welles. Much of this film's accolades came from the era when it was released. Upon release Citizen Kane was a new kind of epic. Orson Welles utilized innovative cinematography techniques, music, and narrative structure to present this cinematic experience.  These innovations went on to affect every element of the film making industry. It is truly is a movie on a huge grand scale.  It's deep and it follows the entire life of a man. Citizen Kane is a fictional portrait of a famous American.  The famous main character is Charles Foster Kane who was played by Orson Welles. Kane is an immensely wealthy man that builds an empire.  He has everything yet he is only human.  He struggles with relationships, fame, responsibly, and emotion just like everyone else. The film explores many issues all humans experience in life. It is full of interesting quotes and could spur many philosophical conversations. Throughout the course of the film you really get a feel for what this characters life was like. Citizen Kane is a very thoughtful and meditative piece. You may not think it is the best movie of all time, but when you watch it you might wonder: could it be?

There's never been this much grayscale in a print of Kane.  The restoration team actually went to the best sources for each reel (the original negatives do not survive) and then digitally-removed each and every scratch from the final composite print (except in the newsreel sequence, where some of the footage is supposed to look scratched).  The sound is rich and full but has no phony exaggerated hi-fi characteristics.  Chapters are easy to access.  Packaging is first rate.  In short, there isn't anything to gripe about.The first disc also has the original theatrical trailer (as original in its own way as the film itself, and a hoot), production stills, bios, newsreel footage of the 1941 premiere--in short all the stuff you'd expect.  Then it has a couple of terrific bonuses in the form of running commentary from Peter Bogdonovich, who knew Welles and wrote a bio on him, and everyone's favorite sweatered film critic, Roger Ebert.  You might think a total of four hours' of lecturing on Kane while the film plays would be tedious in the extreme, but you'd be wrong.  The second disc is a real treat: an Oscar-nominated American Masters documentary from 1995 entitled The Battle Over Citizen Kane, which parallels the life stories of Hearst and Welles as they rose to prominence and fell from influence.  I had taped this show off TV when PBS aired it, but I was thrilled to get this bonus disc of the same documentary here, razor sharp and in superb sound.  Younger folks who don't know much about Citizen Kane beyond the fact that it's considered a &quot;great film,&quot; or who don't know about Welles' many other accomplishments, or about the life of Hearst and the evolution of muckraking journalism, can watch this 2-hour documentary and then have a deeper appreciation of the movie.  The documentary makes a great companion disc and was a wise choice.At the price this is a steal (essentially the second disc is free), the transfer superb, and of course Kane is great, still stunning after all these years.  (A lot of the camera tricks would be hard to pull off even today, in this age of advanced optics and computers.)  There are some really thrilling sequences, snappy dialogue (&quot;I lost a million dollars running the paper this year.  I lost a millon dollars running the paper last year.  I expect to lose a million dollars running the paper next year.  You know, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in sixty years.&quot;)  and terrific performances from everyone save Dorothy Comingore as Susan Alexander, who in my view wasn't quite up to the complex role.  (On the other hand George Coulouris as Mr. Thatcher and Ray Collins as &quot;Boss&quot; Jim W. Gettys are terrific even though they occupy relatively short screen time.)  The cinematography and editing were literally 20 years ahead of their time.  Whether or not Kane is &quot;the greatest film of all time,&quot; it is certainly one of the most influential, and interesting in that it ultimately ended up being more about Welles than about Hearst.  (Which one of them wound up dying alone and lonely and embittered like the character of the film?)

Orsen Welles changed the way movies were made with Citizen Kane by introducing many new camera angles and techniques and with its story structure. Unfortunatley, appreciation for Citizen Kane usually comes only from movie critics and movie buffs and is dismissed by others as `boring'. Admittedly, Citizen Kane is a very deep movie and it may require 2 or 3 viewings to fully understand it and to appreciate it for the masterpiece that it is.There are a number of aspects that make Citizen Kane a classic and a landmark for movie making. The use of camera techniques and angles that Orsen Welles introduced are outstanding. The camerawork in Citizen Kane is outstanding even by today's standards.Then there is the script. Written in such a way that it flows, never looses its way and always keeps you hanging onto every word. It really is one of the greatest scripts ever written.Then of course, there are the themes in Citizen Kane. One is the fact that Kane wants to be loved but doesn't know how to love. Another is the message that riches don't bring you happiness. Charles Foster Kane was a man who had everything yet only really valued 'Rosebud'. Also, Kane was very high in terms of social status and knew a lot of people, yet he was still lonely.Citizen Kane is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again and is just as good everytime.

I heard that it was the one of the greatest films, if not the greatest film of all time. But I had always had my doubts on this movie. It seems to me that almost every film that people consider ""classics"" or ""masterpieces"" are nothing more than overrated, over-hyped films that aren't that great to begin with. After finally watching ""Citizen Kane"" for the first time, I must say that my opinion about these ""classic"" films are still the same. I went into this film with an open mind, really expecting a good movie, but that's not what I got. I got quite a long, boring film with a weak plot and storyline. Heck, I knew what ""Rosebud"" meant 15 minutes before the movie ended!!I found myself not caring about any of the characters at all, especially Kane.

297709,A1LJR5IS0B6ADX,6302135621,"The Straw Man ""J.E. Hoppock""","[22, 73]","This movie is very over rated and if produced today, it would seem rather humdrum.  I believe that this movie is as famous and/or popular as it is because of how the film was made, rather than content itself.  Allow me to explain, Orson Welles had a heck of a time bringing his vision to the screen.  He faced production problems and funding issues and other thorns in the side.  Once he was able to finish the film and the end product was like nothing done before, it was and is placed on a pedestal.  However as far as the film itself, it is so boring and insipid.  I can care less about a politician who is searching for his inner child and the demons of his past.This movie was made several years before World War II; FDR was the president at the time and was rather very popular with the masses.  Does this mean that society back in the 1940s really cared about the ups and downs of a politician?  Consequently, many people could careless about FDR and perhaps politics in general.  Perhaps this explains all the hang ups that Orson Welles ran into during production of ""Citizen Kane"".  Take this notion of empathy ten steps forward, the majority of society in American today don't care about politicians.  Oh I think society cares about politics and the incumbents that drive the machine.  However, I don't believe that society cares about the demons and/or inner child of politicians that emanate behaviors and vetoes.  Society today is a bit more self-centered than that.  Just present this notion ""Rosebud or relief on taxes"".I'd like to backtrack to the production grapples that Orson Welles faced when he was making Citizen Kane.  Just because he had a hard time making this movie doesn't mean that the film is great.  So Orson had some troubles making this movie, big deal.  Productions woes don't constitute a great movie.  If this were the case Ed Wood's ""Glen or Glenda (1953)"" would be a cinematic masterpiece.  Ed Wood had faced many of the same cumbersome issues during the production of ""Glen or Glenda"" that Orson Welles faced making ""Citizen Kane"".  Nevertheless, ""Glen or Glenda"" isn't remembered for its astute aesthesis, it is remembered as a campy B movie.  Which in some ways is sad, the content of ""Glen or Glenda"" touched gender identity disorder and transvestite issues.  At this point in time, during the 1950s, this subject was very taboo.  However, Ed Wood had the courage to pull it off.  In comparison of pushing the envelope, ""Glen or Glenda"" is more memorable than ""Citizen Kane"".I believe there is a cluster of movies people love because they are instructed so by ""film buffs"".  ""Citizen Kane"" as well as ""2001: Space Odyssey"" (which was also a hideous and over rated movie) fall underneath these requirements.  Yet if someone states that they dislike either the former or latter, they are crucified by ""film buffs"".  Also people who proclaim they are ""experts in film history"" know that any type of slander against ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: Space Odyssey"" is heresy.  I know a great deal of film history and did plenty of film/video work both professionally and in college.  Despite my ""declared"" endeavors, I still think that ""Citizen Kane"" sucks, so I guess I'm not a cookie cutter.  Whenever someone states they are an ""expert in film history"" it is just euphuism for ""my opinion is better than yours and you don't know any better.""""Citizen Kane"" is a slow moving film, with flat characters, especially the main character.  I couldn't careless about anything that happened in the movie.  I totally hated ""Citizen Kane"" and think this film takes too much attention away from other classic films.  With respect to these ""so called classics"" (i.e. ""Citizen Kane""), it really does seem that many people assimilate the views of others, rather than using their own critical thinking skills to develop an opinion.Here is a list of some classics that are far superior to ""Citizen Kane""1) Gone With the Wind2) Psycho3) Breakfast at Tiffany's4) The Seven Year Itch5) Scaramouche6) Casablanca7) Suddenly Last Summer8) North by Northwest9) D.O.A (1950)And last but not least10) Glen or Glenda",1,"Hello, I am Charles Foster Lame",1165968000,"12 13, 2006",2006,4120,"['movie', 'very', 'over', 'rated', 'produced', 'today', 'would', 'seem', 'rather', 'humdrum', 'believe', 'movie', 'as', 'famous', 'and/or', 'popular', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'rather', 'content', 'Allow', 'explain', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'had', 'heck', 'time', 'bringing', 'vision', 'screen', 'faced', 'production', 'problems', 'funding', 'issues', 'other', 'thorns', 'side', 'was', 'able', 'finish', 'film', 'end', 'product', 'was', 'nothing', 'done', 'was', 'placed', 'pedestal', 'However', 'as', 'far', 'film', 'so', 'boring', 'insipid', 'can', 'care', 'less', 'politician', 'who', 'searching', 'inner', 'child', 'demons', 'past.This', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'several', 'years', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'FDR', 'was', 'president', 'time', 'was', 'rather', 'very', 'popular', 'masses', 'mean', 'society', 'back', '1940s', 'really', 'cared', 'ups', 'downs', 'politician', 'Consequently', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'careless', 'FDR', 'perhaps', 'politics', 'general', 'Perhaps', 'hang', 'ups', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'ran', 'production', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Take', 'notion', 'empathy', 'ten', 'steps', 'forward', 'majority', 'society', 'American', 'today', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'politicians', 'Oh', 'think', 'society', 'cares', 'politics', 'incumbents', 'drive', 'machine', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'society', 'cares', 'demons', 'and/or', 'inner', 'child', 'politicians', 'emanate', 'behaviors', 'vetoes', 'Society', 'today', 'bit', 'more', 'self-centered', 'Just', 'present', 'notion', 'Rosebud', 'relief', 'taxes', '.I', ""'d"", 'like', 'backtrack', 'production', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'faced', 'when', 'was', 'making', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Just', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'movie', ""n't"", 'mean', 'film', 'great', 'So', 'Orson', 'had', 'troubles', 'making', 'movie', 'big', 'deal', 'Productions', 'woes', 'do', ""n't"", 'constitute', 'great', 'movie', 'were', 'case', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'Glen', 'Glenda', '1953', 'would', 'be', 'cinematic', 'masterpiece', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'had', 'faced', 'many', 'same', 'cumbersome', 'issues', 'production', 'Glen', 'Glenda', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'faced', 'making', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'Nevertheless', 'Glen', 'Glenda', ""n't"", 'remembered', 'astute', 'aesthesis', 'remembered', 'campy', 'B', 'movie', 'Which', 'ways', 'sad', 'content', 'Glen', 'Glenda', 'touched', 'gender', 'identity', 'disorder', 'transvestite', 'issues', 'point', 'time', '1950s', 'subject', 'was', 'very', 'taboo', 'However', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'had', 'courage', 'pull', 'off', 'comparison', 'pushing', 'envelope', 'Glen', 'Glenda', 'more', 'memorable', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '.I', 'believe', 'cluster', 'movies', 'people', 'love', 'are', 'instructed', 'so', 'film', 'buffs', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'as', 'well', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'was', 'also', 'hideous', 'over', 'rated', 'movie', 'fall', 'requirements', 'someone', 'states', 'dislike', 'former', 'latter', 'are', 'crucified', 'film', 'buffs', 'Also', 'people', 'who', 'proclaim', 'are', 'experts', 'film', 'history', 'know', 'type', 'slander', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '2001', 'Space', 'Odyssey', 'heresy', 'know', 'great', 'deal', 'film', 'history', 'did', 'plenty', 'film/video', 'work', 'professionally', 'college', 'declared', 'endeavors', 'still', 'think', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'sucks', 'guess', ""'m"", 'not', 'cookie', 'cutter', 'Whenever', 'someone', 'are', 'expert', 'film', 'history', 'just', 'euphuism', 'opinion', 'better', 'yours', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'slow', 'moving', 'film', 'flat', 'characters', 'especially', 'main', 'character', 'could', ""n't"", 'careless', 'anything', 'happened', 'movie', 'totally', 'hated', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'think', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'attention', 'away', 'other', 'classic', 'films', 'respect', 'so', 'called', 'classics', 'i.e', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'really', 'seem', 'many', 'people', 'assimilate', 'views', 'others', 'rather', 'using', 'own', 'critical', 'thinking', 'skills', 'develop', 'opinion.Here', 'list', 'classics', 'are', 'far', 'superior', 'Citizen', 'Kane', '1', 'Gone', 'Wind2', 'Psycho3', 'Breakfast', ""Tiffany's4"", 'Seven', 'Year', 'Itch5', 'Scaramouche6', 'Casablanca7', 'Suddenly', 'Last', 'Summer8', 'North', 'Northwest9', 'D.O.A', '1950', 'last', 'not', 'least10', 'Glen', 'Glenda']",N/A

A movie depicting a man's unhappiness (despite incredible wealth), it manages to deliver the prevailing message that it's the simple things that can bring happiness to a person. In Kane's case, a sled with ""Rosebud"" written on it, and the happiness that this sled brought him during his childhood means more than anything else Kane ever did in his life. The Xanadu estate of Kane is massive, and even a bit mysterious and haunting;  Orson Welles' vision of Kane's world leaves nothing in the bag.

Of course, the battle to stop this film from being released ensued, and almost resulted in no film.

From the standpoint of cinematography, it might just deserve all the accolades that have been heaped upon it all these years. But my specific bone to pick with Citizen Kane is a story line that kind of runs out of gas.Orson Welles said that 'Kane' was not specifically about William Randolph Hearst but represents a sort of composite portrait of the rise and fall of a prominent American in the public eye. But one can see clearly that Welles had it in for Hearst. So much of the first half of the movie (up until the midpoint) is reminiscent of Hearst. And indeed it is the most compelling part of the picture. Up until half-way through Kane we feel that Welles is really being fair to his Kane-Hearst character who's depicted as charming but also capable of acts of megalomania. It's this multi-dimensional portrait throughout the first half that really grips our attention. Plot wise the stakes are raised until Kane's thunderous fall from grace when he's caught in a ""love nest"" with the ""singer"". This is the setup for the second half of Act 2 of the script leading to the 'point of no return' when Kane flips out after his second wife leaves him.Welles was faced with a big problem in the second half of his script--what to do with main character? The first half is so believable because it is based on the events of a real person's life. But when Welles looked to Hearst for inspiration for the second half of his movie, there really were few compelling conflicts LEFT for him to latch on to. In real life, Hearst continued to publish his newspaper, was sort of a recluse who didn't reveal much about his private life and did NOT have a bad relationship with the woman who he was involved with (in contrast to the relationship between the fictional Susan Alexander and Charles Foster Kane). So what did Welles do? He decided to create a false portrait of Hearst, a veritable straw man, which he could easily shoot down. Welles, the Hollywood 'progressive' now went into battle as the standard bearer, slaying the 'reactionary' Hearst. Kane-Hearst loses his charm and basically becomes almost completely unlikable in the second half of the movie. Welles grafts a 'character flaw' on to Kane-Hearst based on a man named McCormick, a Chicago heir who promoted the singing career of his no-talent mistress which is reflected in the Susan Alexander Kane story arc.By falsely depicting Kane-Hearst as a violent man obsessed with trivial pursuits, we no longer see a character who is multi-faceted. This is Welles deceiving himself that he's 'better' than William Randolph Hearst (despite Welles's disingenuous claims that the character was not really based on Hearst.)Citizen Kane is really the harbinger of things to come for Orson Welles's career--a career that ran the gamut from profound inspiration to adolescent narcissism. Technically Citizen Kane was probably the greatest film ever made and full of sensational performances. But at the same time Welles's elitist point of view and simple inability to follow through to complete a story full of great promise diminishes the overall impact (in small measure) of an American classic.",4,Kane falls down in second half,1292112000,"12 12, 2010",2010,3264,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***It', 'difficult', 'criticizing', 'movie', 'hailed', 'greatest', 'movie', 'time', 'standpoint', 'cinematography', 'might', 'just', 'deserve', 'accolades', 'have', 'been', 'heaped', 'years', 'specific', 'bone', 'pick', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'story', 'line', 'kind', 'runs', 'gas.Orson', 'Welles', 'said', ""'Kane"", 'was', 'not', 'specifically', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'sort', 'composite', 'portrait', 'rise', 'fall', 'prominent', 'American', 'public', 'eye', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'clearly', 'Welles', 'had', 'Hearst', 'So', 'much', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'midpoint', 'reminiscent', 'Hearst', 'indeed', 'most', 'compelling', 'part', 'picture', 'half-way', 'Kane', 'feel', 'Welles', 'really', 'being', 'fair', 'Kane-Hearst', 'character', 'who', 'depicted', 'charming', 'also', 'capable', 'acts', 'megalomania', 'multi-dimensional', 'portrait', 'first', 'half', 'really', 'attention', 'Plot', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'Kane', 'thunderous', 'fall', 'grace', 'when', 'caught', 'love', 'nest', 'singer', 'setup', 'second', 'half', 'Act', '2', 'script', 'leading', ""'point"", 'return', 'when', 'Kane', 'out', 'second', 'wife', 'him.Welles', 'was', 'faced', 'big', 'problem', 'second', 'half', 'script', 'what', 'do', 'main', 'character', 'first', 'half', 'so', 'believable', 'based', 'events', 'real', 'person', 'life', 'when', 'Welles', 'looked', 'Hearst', 'inspiration', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'really', 'were', 'few', 'compelling', 'conflicts', 'LEFT', 'latch', 'real', 'life', 'Hearst', 'continued', 'publish', 'newspaper', 'was', 'sort', 'recluse', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'much', 'private', 'life', 'did', 'NOT', 'have', 'bad', 'relationship', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'involved', 'contrast', 'relationship', 'fictional', 'Susan', 'Alexander', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'what', 'did', 'Welles', 'do', 'decided', 'create', 'false', 'portrait', 'Hearst', 'veritable', 'straw', 'man', 'could', 'easily', 'shoot', 'down', 'Welles', 'Hollywood', ""'progressive"", 'now', 'went', 'battle', 'standard', 'bearer', 'slaying', ""'reactionary"", 'Hearst', 'Kane-Hearst', 'charm', 'basically', 'almost', 'completely', 'unlikable', 'second', 'half', 'movie', 'Welles', ""'character"", 'flaw', 'Kane-Hearst', 'based', 'man', 'named', 'McCormick', 'Chicago', 'heir', 'who', 'promoted', 'singing', 'career', 'no-talent', 'mistress', 'reflected', 'Susan', 'Alexander', 'Kane', 'story', 'arc.By', 'falsely', 'depicting', 'Kane-Hearst', 'violent', 'man', 'obsessed', 'trivial', 'pursuits', 'no', 'longer', 'see', 'character', 'who', 'multi-faceted', 'Welles', 'deceiving', ""'better"", 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'Welles', 'disingenuous', 'claims', 'character', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'based', 'Hearst', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'really', 'harbinger', 'things', 'come', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'career', 'career', 'ran', 'gamut', 'profound', 'inspiration', 'adolescent', 'narcissism', 'Technically', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'was', 'probably', 'greatest', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'full', 'sensational', 'performances', 'same', 'time', 'Welles', 'elitist', 'point', 'view', 'simple', 'inability', 'follow', 'complete', 'story', 'full', 'great', 'promise', 'overall', 'impact', 'small', 'measure', 'American', 'classic']",N/A

Orson Welles is supurb in the leading role, portraying the rags to riches newspaper publisher who becomes more stingy and cold as his riches and popularity, and power, increase.New techniques in film making, also Welles doing, gives the movie more depth.  Fast cuts, and overlapping dialogue are Welles doing.  Watch for the close ups, and scenes where the camera pans directly down from the ceiling - also Welles innovation.  They are standard now, but never would have been but for Welles.The story begins with Kane on his deathbed, uttering that immortal and illusive word &quot;rosebud&quot;.  He dies.  No sooner than he is buried than an extensive search is made to discover what the meaning of &quot;rosebud&quot; is.  Newspaper reporters visit close friends, and distant enemies of Kane to gather insight.Now, the movie changes.  A biography of the man's life is unfolded, unraveled, and, at times, maliciously documented; and depending on who is telling the story, Kane is either hero or villian.We see Kane as a little boy, being dragged away from his parents to live in wealth and comfortability.  He does not want to leave his mother; though it is at her insisting he leave, for the sake of his future.  The frame cuts, and it is now 20 years later, and enter Orson Welles.  Kane is a young man now, headstrong, ambitious, and power hungry; a shell of the innocent boy we saw only minutes earlier.  His life has changed.  But is it what his mother had wanted?Throughout the rest of the film, Kane ages as fast as his character develops more hunger and thirst for power, always putting his work ahead of friends and family; lusting for more, more, more, and never satisfied ... until he ultimately destroys himself.The movie can be a bit long at times, and, as I have done, have the viewer fidgeting in his seat, wondering when the action will pick up.

Like all timeless classics, age has not withered its potency, and 70 years later it is as relevant as ever and absolutely just as moving as it no doubt was back in 1941.Blu Ray-wise, it's even better. Movies this old should not look this good. It just doesn't seem right, and yet, here it is - presented absolutely perfectly without the tiniest flicker or grain, in stunning STUNNING 1080p that gives incredible details to old coats, snow flurries, mansions, facial expressions.. and, well, every single shot. It's glossy all the way throughout. This is NOT a low budget restoration, it's a transformation like no generation has yet to experience. If you think Blu Ray can only enhance modern, color spectacles, watch this movie. You will be proven wrong. In fact, some of my all-time favorite blu rays to show off my 1080p television are Black and White.Casablanca [BLU-RAY] andThe Twilight Zone [Blu-ray] are just some examples that dazzle a high definition screen.

297721,A35L2E8M7S59MQ,6302135621,V. Berk,"[5, 5]","In 1941 actor/director/writer Orson Welles would release one of the most cherished films to ever hit the silver screen.  Many have cited it as the greatest film of all time, and many more agree that Citizen Kane is the quintessential American movie.  Like all great films it transcends traditional narrative to become something all its own.  The movie almost holds a surreal feel as audiences are thrust into the luxurious, yet lonely life of Charles Foster Kane.Citizen Kane is a great looking film, no question about it.  It's obvious that the sets are fake but the movie uses that to its full advantage.  Each of these sets is so exaggerated and ornate that it allows the film to transcend generations.  It's a kind of timeless quality that is rarely seen in contemporary pieces.  What looked good in this film upon its release still looks good to this day because it is an exaggeration of the American culture, which when someone really thinks about it, hasn't changed much since the time of Citizen Kane's release.Even more important to Citizen Kane's set designs are the lighting mixed with expert photography.  Lighting of Kane becomes the most crucial aspect of discerning his character and foreshadowing his path.  Though the dialogue is often brilliant, Citizen Kane seems to have been made with solely the visuals in mind, because it is clear that the story of Kane's rise and fall can be told through the powerful imagery presented throughout the movie.From being the ""voice of the people"" through the use of his newspaper (The Inquirer) to giving off the ferocious political campaign speeches clearly inspired by Adolf Hitler, the scope of Citizen Kane never seems to back down in its uncompromising character-study of a man who could never back down.  As the viewer follows his path towards self-destruction they realize that this character is not unlike many who still inhabit the country to this very day.  When they look at Orson Welles as Kane they can see the type of person everyone knows all too well.  Everyone knows about someone who will do anything for love, only to discover he's done all the wrong things.  Kane fails in life because he never learns that an emotion such as love can never be bought.  Gratitude can be bought, or appreciation, but love requires something beyond the material realm of personal interaction.  All these emotional issues are brought to focus by the film's outstanding scope, which is far ahead of its time.What else stands out about this film?  Everyone cites the lighting, directing, and sets, but also one needs to keep in mind: Orson Welles' acting is extraordinary.  He can be funny, tragic, compelling, charismatic, and many scenes he is in make-up in order to play Kane through the decades.  Surely it is one of the greatest performances ever captured on the silver screen.So, is Citizen Kane the ""greatest movie ever made""?  Without much hesitation the answer is yes.  Maybe it isn't at times the most entertaining film ever made, but it clearly has the merits that make it worth seeing again and again.  This film looks great, its story is full of loose-ends for the audience to solve for themselves, but most important of all is how well the film has aged.  There are not many, if any complaints to be had in regards to Orson Welles cinematic landmark.Citizen Kane remains the undisputed champion of American cinema...But how is the DVD?  Well, in short: the two-disc special edition is a great restoration of this film and includes a great deal of special features.  The best of these features is a feature length commentary by infamous film critic Roger Ebert and the other being the documentary ""The Battle for Citizen Kane"" which is a great overview of the conflict between Orson Welles and communications tycoon William Hearst.If you truly love movies you'd be a fool not to have this landmark film as a part of your collection.",5,Greatest movie of all time?

It is a wonderfully engaging story of a dynamic man in a dynamic world. It is a remarkable statement for the wide range of time periods that it covers. It is a deceptively simple story centering on perhaps the most meaningful word in all of moviedom.Behind all that, Citizen Kane is the American cinema. There is not a major director today who has not been influenced by the genius Orson Welles put forth in his debut masterpiece. The film centers around a group of reporters investigating the origin of the dying newspaper tycoon (loosely based on William Randolph Hearst), Charles Foster Kane's last word: Rosebud.The movie begins with an unforgettable newsreel montage summarizing the man's life. From there on, the viewer is thrown into a gloriously chaotic world of flashbacks upon flashbacks, in which the viewer slowly learns just about everything about Charles Foster Kane's enthralling life. From his trying childhood to his rise to power to the pinnacle of his success to his marital difficulties to his fall from grace, the story of Charles Foster Kane is presented for the viewer in a way that few other movies can offer: magically.Citizen Kane, arguably, is THE triumph of the American cinema, and one of the greatest films every created.

297724,A3T689SS856U3N,6302135621,Vincent Lassauw,"[1, 2]","It is a spooky night. Atmospheric dramatic music accompanies the camera to a heavily fenced perimeter. The heavy cast iron entry gate shows an ominous logo, a circle with a big K inside it, right next to it a sign saying ""No Trespassing"" and right then we know we will enter a domain, which is forbidden to anyone but the viewer. In the far distance in the darkness we notice a single lonely light coming from a gigantic mansion, but we still have quite a way to go and so we continue our ghostly journey across this mysterious and haunting estate while we keep an eye on the light, passing a lifeless pond, sculptures, a zoo and all in a more or less state of decay. Suddenly the light coming from the house is extinguished. The music holds its breath, what's going on here? We sense it's more than merely a person going off to bed; the music and preceding images have prepared us for something different.There's a slow transition and suddenly we are in a room where it's ... snowing? in soft white idyllic looking scenery, midst of which we notice a rather ramshackle house. The camera pulls back and we now realize we were looking inside one of these glass toys, held by a hand that, while its owner expels his last breath, must release its grip and it falls to the ground where it shatters, after which the camera zooms in to the lips of the dying man which can still utter one last word ""Rosebud"" before closing forever.This is the magic beginning of a brilliant movie called ""Citizen Kane"" , probably the most famous directorial debut in cinematic history from Orson Welles, who the world mostly knew before that as the voice behind the notorious ""War of the Worlds"" radio show that panicked half the country as it was taken for a news broadcast, who subsequently became famous with his ""Mercury Theatre Company"" both of which resulted in him getting an up to then unprecedented carte blanche for his debut feature which included sole final cut control.The owner of aforementioned lips is called Charles Foster Kane, media mogul with even presidential ambitions once upon a time that were thwarted during a senator election because of a cover-up. The movie's premise is simple: a journalist's attempt to track down the meaning of the mysterious last word coming from Kane's mouth ""Rosebud"".We tag along his research which involves a series of interviews of key people in Kane's life that offer us through the flashbacks they trigger a gradual insight into his life: His childhood in poor circumstances, an inheritance on condition of leaving behind said childhood in general and his mother in particular and eventual retreat literally and metaphorically behind walls to shield himself from the outside world by whom he feels unloved and misunderstood. Most of all Kane is a tragically lonely man with emptiness in his heart, created there by the forced severing of the connection with his mother as a child, which he keeps on trying to desperately fill by either earning or trying to buy people's love.As he is unable to really invest something of himself in any relationship, all his human contacts remain hollow and long term are doomed to fail, which no huge and megalomaniac ""Xanadu"" can remedy, the estate he bought and ""pimped"" one would say nowadays I suppose, with art and animals from all over the world, to rule his own little empire that the world wouldn't permit him outside its bounds.Orson Welles with this movie created a first rate masterpiece, helped by the fantastic script by mainly Joseph Manckiewicz (with input by John Houseman and Welles himself), a great director himself, and cinematographer Gregg Toland who came up with all kinds of technical novelties like the famous ""deep focus"" shots. Quite experimental as well was the use of sound and light, but those are just interesting little facts. Sure, they contribute to the movie's impact, but it is the story and the cast's performances that give it life.Our tenacious reporter will never find the answer to the question of the meaning of the word ""Rosebud"", but the director mercifully informs the audience. That being said a lot of guesswork remains for the viewer and to some extend it will remain a mystery as to who this Charles Foster Kane really was.I will not go into the parallels between the fictional character of Kane and newspaper owner William Randolph Hearst, the included documentary ""The Battle over Citizen Kane"" will serve to give all the information one could wish for on that matter and it's quite fascinating, but in the end to me inconsequential to the appreciation of this movie.All this nonsense about ""Best Movie of All Time"" I leave to other people to debate;

That's open to debate but it is a stunning debut that set a standard difficult to follow. At the ripe old age of 26 after a steady diet of theater, literature and performance Welles decided to turn his gaze on the one art form he really hadn't mastered. After watching John Ford's Stagecoach (and one can assume a number of Hitchcock films as well), Welles and his collaborators Herman J. Mankiewicz, cinematographer Gregg Toland and film editor Robert Wise created one of the enduring classics of American cinema.Edit: The Blu-ray edition of this film is exceptional and an improvement over the previously over processed DVD released a decade ago. Warner has done an exceptional job of restoring the film to Blu-ray providing fans with a sharp looking presentation with previously unnoticed detail (at least on home video) and a far more film-like presentation.Keep in mind that while Welles was in charge, Mank, Toland and Wise all played a substanial part in helping to create this classic film.

I viewed it again around the age of 40, and appreciated it a bit more. Finally, I watched it  again last week, and totally enjoyed it...the writing, acting, directing, odd style of story-telling, crazy camera angles, and all. When I was in college, a popular book was ""Citizen Hearst"", a biography of William Randolph Hearst, who Orson Welles was satirizing with his Kane character. Kane and Hearst share many traits in common, but the movie is not a thinly disguised biography of the Rupert Murdoch of his era. It is a work of fiction, a study of a man whose personality was shaped when he was a heart-broken boy, and whose inherited wealth led him to glory, power, even more wealth, and finally ruin. As is mentioned in the film, ""Charles Foster Kane wanted to be loved"" but he didn't know how to get it except through purchase or pandering.

Welles' mock[ing]-""biography"" of William Randolph Hearst is an attack on just about everything wrong with this country. Nothing has changed in 70 years, and ""Kane"" remains an indictment of our vulgar, grossly materialistic society. It is also an extremely entertaining -- and yes, fun -- film that holds your interest from beginning to end. The last 30 seconds -- among the most-famous in film history -- ought to make any halfway rational person seriously question what they're doing with their lives. (The ""Kane"" theme is a variation on the ""Dies Irae"".)Is it really the best movie ever made? I can only answer that with another question -- what film would replace it for #1? When ""People"" magazine selected the 100 greatest films more than a decade ago, ""Kane"" was #2, behind ""The Godfather"". As great as Coppola's masterpiece is, it lacks the ""startle factor"" of ""Kane"". Even by modern standards, ""Kane""'s screenplay, cinematography, and non-linear (but easily grasped) structure remain remarkable. Reviewers said they'd never seen anything like it, and in an age of boring, overwrought CGI extravaganzas, ""Kane"" remains unique. No one has quite caught up with it. *'til now, the best transfer was the DVD of a few years back (apparently from the composite negative), a big improvement over the previous transfers from prints. This is probably from the same source, but scanned at 4K. Whether you should replace that copy depends on how big your set is, how close you sit, and the quality of the scaler in your BD player. All I can say is that I've never enjoyed the film so much.The only thing that would get me to buy yet another edition (I still have the Criterion LV) is a restoration of the soundtrack. If the dialog and effects stems still exist (and they probably do), it would be nothing more than a matter of finding the money to re-record Bernard Herrmann's score in modern surround sound. With a bit of amplitude and phase EQ to the dialog, ""Citizen Kane"" would emerge even better than the original.* Since writing this, I've thought of two films that can truly stand comparison with ""Citizen Kane"" -- ""Chinatown"" and ""L.

For me, the most interesting part of Citizen Kane is seeing the kind of person Charles Foster Kane (Welles) was to others (he is seen as an egomaniac, shallow, lonely, private, and mysterious by each of them).  Nobody knows the real Kane in the end, not even the viewer.  This is one of those movies you should see at least once in your life (and if you really like it, you should see it again!).",5,A Classic (And I Won't Tell What &quot;Rosebud&quot; Is!),972432000,"10 25, 2000",2000,897,"['was', 'movie', 'had', 'see', 'History', 'Cinema', 'class', 'professor', 'warned', 'who', 'already', 'saw', 'not', 'give', 'away', 'significance', 'quot', 'Rosebud', 'quot', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'outdid', 'direction', 'different', 'effects', 'made', 'enemy', 'William', 'Randolph', 'Hearst', 'who', 'film', 'supposedly', 'about', 'Beranrd', 'Hermann', 'who', 'also', 'contributed', 'music', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'movies', 'particularly', 'Psycho', 'Twilight', 'Zone', 'TV', 'series', 'excellent', 'job', 'score', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'Citizen', 'Kane', 'seeing', 'kind', 'person', 'Charles', 'Foster', 'Kane', 'Welles', 'was', 'others', 'seen', 'egomaniac', 'shallow', 'lonely', 'private', 'mysterious', 'Nobody', 'real', 'Kane', 'end', 'not', 'even', 'viewer', 'one', 'movies', 'should', 'see', 'least', 'once', 'life', 'really', 'should', 'see', 'again']",N/A

True, it was made in 1941, and it's in black and white, but it's a masterpiece nevertheless. This film is noteworthy for several reasons. This work is consistently at the top of film lists. It has a special place in film history for the innovative approach employed at the time it was released in 1941. From my perspective, this film should be on the summer viewing lists for every high school student.

It deals with so many things, and made in such an artistic way, its no surprise it was named the number one film. See this film! Its about a newspaper publisher named Kane, who becomes world famous, and his situations in life. Everyone wants to know about him and whats going on with him. He dies, and everyone wants to know the meaning of his last word on earth: Rosebud. A journalist is assigned to interview everyone who was close with Kane to find out about him and the meaning of his last word. We then are taken back throughout his life, and shown how someone can be so many different things to different people. This film also deals with what love, money, and being famous, mean to us as humans. This film has so much in it to discuss and study and reflect upon. If your into that, then I suggest you watch this film, if not, then just watch it for an interesting story. I'm sure you will get something meaningful out of it. 5 stars.
