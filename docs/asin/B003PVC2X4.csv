1357019,A35AFXBYZ4WK2O,B003PVC2X4,C. D. White,"[2, 3]","For those who are unfamiliar with the names Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant (which if you are drawn to this DVD I doubt) they were the creators of the original BBC version of The Office. Once I heard about this movie about a year ago I was excited to see it, it being Gervais and Merchant's first film outing as a team. Since it was a direct to DVD release here in America that wait was extended slightly since it's Theatrical release. But the wait and hype has been rewarded with this coming of age story.Just like the BBC's Office where this film succeeds is in showing the subtlties of human interaction - this isn't really a spoiler, it doesn't give the plot away but...there's a scene about halfway through the film in which we witness the annual ""Winner's Ball"". This is a function the company the protagonist works for holds every year. The honorees of the Winner's Ball are new salesmen and retiring ones if it is to be assumed that the Winner's Ball in the film is a typical one. And here's why I've been prattling on/setting up this particular scene because it exemplifies the subtlties of human interaction - The boss, Mr. Kendrick (Ralph Fiennes) is giving a speech to an employee retiring after 32 years of service what he says to the retiring employee is banal platitudes and the employee answers back Mr. Kendrick in a matter of fact detached way. But it's the body language that sells the scene and lets you in on what is really being said. The boss cares nothing about this employee and the employee in turn looks to be in no mood to celebrate his career but rather keep up appearances. That in a nutshell is part of what makes this movie great. What is unsaid and implied is what is gripping about the film. And when you juxtapose that with irrevrently funny moments through out that is what makes up the majority of this film. If you have seen the BBC Office this territory should be familiar (if not I highly recommend watching that as well).My only complaint with the movie is the ending. It's a perfectly fitting one but you can see it coming from a mile away so it seems anticlimactic. But ultimately the ending is satisfying and seems relatively authentic so it works(This is hard to say without giving anything away, but there are a couple of scenes leading up to the predictable ending that touched me on a deeper level. So for my personal tastes I would have rather had them re-order the scenes toward the end where the typical end was shown before some of the lesser characters resolutions but I understand the choices the filmmakers made ultimately. That was just my personal reaction to it.) Other than that the script is great as I expected. The direction isn't stunning but doesn't drag the movie down either. Apart from a few good shots the direction simply exists...neither good nor bad. The acting from a mostly unknown cast was great as well.All in all, this is a funny touching movie well worth your time and I hope the first of many funny touching ones from the great team of Gervais and Merchant.",4,Predictable but Great regardless,1282262400,"08 20, 2010",2010,3038,"['who', 'are', 'unfamiliar', 'names', 'Ricky', 'Gervais', 'Stephen', 'Merchant', 'are', 'drawn', 'DVD', 'doubt', 'were', 'creators', 'original', 'BBC', 'version', 'Office', 'heard', 'movie', 'year', 'was', 'excited', 'see', 'being', 'Gervais', 'Merchant', 'first', 'film', 'outing', 'team', 'was', 'direct', 'DVD', 'release', 'here', 'America', 'wait', 'was', 'extended', 'slightly', 'Theatrical', 'release', 'wait', 'hype', 'been', 'rewarded', 'coming', 'age', 'story.Just', 'BBC', 'Office', 'where', 'film', 'showing', 'subtlties', 'human', 'interaction', ""n't"", 'really', 'spoiler', ""n't"", 'give', 'plot', 'away', 'scene', 'halfway', 'film', 'witness', 'annual', 'Winner', 'Ball', 'function', 'company', 'protagonist', 'year', 'honorees', 'Winner', 'Ball', 'are', 'new', 'salesmen', 'retiring', 'ones', 'be', 'assumed', 'Winner', 'Ball', 'film', 'typical', 'one', 'here', 'why', ""'ve"", 'been', 'prattling', 'on/setting', 'up', 'particular', 'scene', 'subtlties', 'human', 'interaction', 'boss', 'Mr.', 'Kendrick', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'giving', 'speech', 'employee', 'retiring', '32', 'years', 'service', 'what', 'retiring', 'employee', 'banal', 'platitudes', 'employee', 'answers', 'back', 'Mr.', 'Kendrick', 'matter', 'fact', 'detached', 'way', 'body', 'language', 'scene', 'what', 'really', 'being', 'said', 'boss', 'nothing', 'employee', 'employee', 'turn', 'looks', 'be', 'mood', 'celebrate', 'career', 'rather', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'nutshell', 'part', 'what', 'movie', 'great', 'What', 'unsaid', 'implied', 'what', 'gripping', 'film', 'when', 'juxtapose', 'irrevrently', 'funny', 'moments', 'what', 'up', 'majority', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'BBC', 'Office', 'territory', 'should', 'be', 'familiar', 'not', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'as', 'well', 'only', 'complaint', 'movie', 'ending', 'perfectly', 'fitting', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'anticlimactic', 'ultimately', 'ending', 'satisfying', 'relatively', 'authentic', 'hard', 'say', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'leading', 'up', 'predictable', 'ending', 'touched', 'deeper', 'level', 'So', 'personal', 'tastes', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'had', 're-order', 'scenes', 'end', 'where', 'typical', 'end', 'was', 'shown', 'lesser', 'characters', 'resolutions', 'understand', 'choices', 'filmmakers', 'made', 'ultimately', 'was', 'just', 'personal', 'reaction', 'Other', 'script', 'great', 'expected', 'direction', ""n't"", 'stunning', ""n't"", 'drag', 'movie', 'down', 'either', 'Apart', 'few', 'good', 'shots', 'direction', 'simply', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'acting', 'mostly', 'unknown', 'cast', 'was', 'great', 'well.All', 'funny', 'touching', 'movie', 'well', 'time', 'hope', 'first', 'many', 'funny', 'touching', 'ones', 'great', 'team', 'Gervais', 'Merchant']",N/A

1357021,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B003PVC2X4,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[0, 0]","Actor/director Ricky Gervais returns to the director's scene alongside longtime friend/writer Stephen Merchant (both who have previously worked in BBC's ""The Office"") in a coming-of-age story of three British teens in 1973 and inspired by Bruce Springsteen's song ""Thunder Road"".VIDEO:""Cemetery Junction"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  Picture quality is well-done as detail of the 70's exteriors are well-captured.  I will say that the overall look of the film and Gervais and Merchant explain their goal in achieving the '70s look and growing up in Reading.  Certain scenes show off a lot of color, from Freddie's blue shirt or blue eyes to the reds that are seen during the dance sequence.  Granted, I do feel that the dance sequence seems more modern than 1973 but that was probably my own personal quirk.The film definitely looks great on Blu-ray, although there is one scene taken place when Freddie and Julie are in her film developing room in which there seems to be some experimentation on video and it seemed as if there was globs of artifacting but I think that it was more of a psychedelic experiment with red lighting and filtering. But that was probably the only scene that caught my attention and made me wonder if there were problems video-wise.Blacks are nice and deep in certain scenes and for the most part, picture quality is well-done.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Cemetery Junction"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS-HD MA and in English-Audio Description Track 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is primarily dialogue driven but there are some parts, such as the factory in which your room is enveloped by the sound of machinery and the LFE and surround channels are kicked up a notch.  But aside from that primary scene, the film is center and front channel driven and what shines about ""Cemetery Junction"" is its soundtrack which features music by Elton John, David Bowie, Led Zeppelin, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music and Ralph Vaughan Williams.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Cemetery Junction"" comes with the following special features in high definition, English 2.0 and subtitles in English:* Commentary with Writers/Directors Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant - Audio commentary by both directors Gervais and Merchant with optional English subtitles.  Gervais and Merchant talk about the film and also explain how they wanted to capture the 1973 and how, outside of London, these areas were not 1973-definitive since towns still looked as if they were several years behind.* Cast Commentary with Christian Cooke, Tom Hughes, and Jack Doolan - Featuring the audio of the three main characters of the film.  The commentary features optional English subtitles.  The cast talk about their experiences while shooting the film.* Deleted Scenes - (13:38) Featuring ten deleted scenes.* Blooper Reel - (13:42) Featuring outtakes from ""Cemetery Junction"".* The Directors: A Conversation with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant - (15:07)  Both Gervais and Merchant talking about how they wanted to make a serious feel-good coming-of-age drama.* The Lads Look Back: The Stars Discuss Cemetery Junction - (10:14) Tom Hughes, Christian Cooke and Jack Doolan talk about the auditions, being cast on the film and working on ""Cemetery Junction"".* Seventies Style: Production and Costume Design - (8:44) The cast talk about the '70s look and what went into the production and costume design for the film.  Production designer Anna Higginson talks about what she wanted to capture for the homes of the main characters, while costume designer Ruth Myers.* Production Featurette - (6:45) Featuring three production featurettes:  The Start of Filming, Week 1, Meet The Boys and The Directors On Set.* movieIQ+sync (logo) and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!JUDGMENT CALL:""Cemetery Junction"" is a film that carries on the banality of young adult life in your usual coming-of-age type of film but a definite step-up for Ricky Gervais from his previous directorial stint in ""The Invention of Lying"".  Both Gervais and co-director Stephen Merchant were able to come up with a pretty fun, stylish film that doesn't come anywhere near any gag-driven type of comedy films that Gervais is known for but the two men were able to come up with a heartfelt coming-of-age film.For the most part, the friendships between the Freddie, Bruce and Snork is quite fun to watch and and like most teen coming-of-age films, you know there is trouble to be had for these young men.  As the film takes place in the '70s, the problem that I have is these both Freddie and Bruce look like they come out of a GQ magazine than two young men who grew up in a town in which their family are not the best in their financial situation.  You would like to think that these young adults who have pretty much have gotten themselves quite a bit of trouble had challenging upbringings but I felt the casting for a few of the characters were just too good to be believed.I actually did question the films timeline of taking place in 1973 but according to Gervais and Merchant, in the small towns outside of London, despite the time period of 1973, many towns were behind a few years in terms of overall decor and aesthetics.  So, they wanted to have an early '70s look but not overly emphasizing the '70s in general.  But I will definitely give the film credit for its cool soundtrack!But the film's structure is simple and in many ways, there are no surprises.  Personally, I was welcoming some sort of tragedy to fall upon one of the friends, or possibly the two best friends having enough of each other and getting into a brawl but I suppose that would be too much of a cliche.But I felt the chemistry of the three friends worked quite well onscreen.  Both Cooke and Hughes are obviously standouts in their role and Jack Doolan is like the UK version of Jack Black or Jonah Hill.  And the cast does benefit with veteran talent courtesy of the performances by Ralph Fiennes, Emily Watson, Steve Speirs and Francis Magee.The Blu-ray release of ""Cemetery Junction"" does come with its fair share of special features and the addition of two audio commentary, one for the directors and the other with the three main cast members was a nice addition.Overall, ""Cemetery Junction"" is a fun, entertaining and heartfelt film.  The story doesn't strive to be anything great, nor does strive to be anything else but just a usual coming-of-age film.  There is no significant climax, it's just a group of friends growing up, getting in trouble, having fun and moving on.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And because of that, the film is just average.  But I do welcome Ricky Gervais trying something different and not becoming a director who gets pigeon-holed for only comedy-based films.Nevertheless, ""Cemetery Junction"" shows us that Gervais and Merchant work quite well with each other, granted I'm not expecting them to be the next Powell or Pressburger but perhaps their next collaboration will be bring us something much more ambitious, compelling and entertaining.",4,"Blu-ray: Very good PQ and a good amount of special features.

He and co-writer/director Merchant hit the ultimate tv comedy home run with the original and best BBC Office, but have since done little to match it. Gervais' movies and comedy have been rather cheesy, such as The Invention Of Lying, and he's seemed to be slipping into star mode and missing the sharp workingman's edge that made The Office so superb. Yet redemption is at hand in the form of this wonderful little character study.Hollywood probably used the excuse of CJ being too British for US release, but the truth is it's also a little too good compared to most romantic comedies coming out over here lately. This film has everything they don't: truly intelligent dialogue, a real laugh every minute, and a genuine heart that never gets sappy. The key is Christian Cooke, a soon-to-be-big-star if ever I saw one, who holds his own in every way here even when playing against Fiennes, who is as always perfect. Cooke completely wraps himself in his character here and is believable at every point. His love interest, Felicity Jones, is likewise winning and a treat to watch, as are his mates, especially the sly Tom Hughes.The script is tight and unforced and fits in exactly the right amount of comedy and pathos while moving the story along briskly. It's an old plot but it's done very nicely and leaves little to be desired. It's interesting watching the extras, as they're mostly excellent and could easily be in the film, but Gervais and Merchant were wise to cut them; it moves things along just enough to make this a film with almost no dead moments.Gervais himself is hilarious as Cooke's Dad, and his grandma is played to the hilt by Anne Reid. She's the kind of character actor that Britain has always been adept at producing, extremely skilled at creating a persona in just a few lines, just like the chip store owner here. These brief turns by talented people abound in CJ and are part of its true charm.If you grew up in the early 70s, and/or knew Britain back then (I did both, so I'm biased towards this story), Cemetery Junction will ring many bells. All the little details are spot on, from the score and the songs to the language, clothes and sets. It all feels very real and never fake, and that helps make this standard story of children becoming adults all the more poignant. The predictable ending is also very heartfelt, and there's really nothing wrong with everyone getting what they deserve, especially when it's all for the best.I think that in a few years this will be seen as a true classic in every way. It's warm, winning and very funny at moments, and is easily the best romantic comedy I've seen in many a moon.Gervais is clearly a softy at heart, as well as a fine writer and capable director, and Cemetery Junction can sit comfortably next to The Office on his shelf as a true modern classic: quiet, unassumingly sweet, and often hilarious.",5,A quiet little classic; Gervais' best since The Office,1283126400,"08 30, 2010",2010,3003,"['4.5', 'starsA', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'coming', 'age', 'film', 'Cemetery', 'Junction', 'best', 'sides', 'Gervais', 'little', 'worst', 'co-writer/director', 'Merchant', 'hit', 'ultimate', 'tv', 'comedy', 'home', 'run', 'original', 'best', 'BBC', 'Office', 'have', 'done', 'little', 'match', 'Gervais', 'movies', 'comedy', 'have', 'been', 'rather', 'cheesy', 'such', 'Invention', 'Lying', 'seemed', 'be', 'slipping', 'star', 'mode', 'missing', 'sharp', 'workingman', 'edge', 'made', 'Office', 'so', 'superb', 'redemption', 'hand', 'form', 'wonderful', 'little', 'character', 'study.Hollywood', 'probably', 'used', 'excuse', 'CJ', 'being', 'too', 'British', 'US', 'release', 'truth', 'also', 'little', 'too', 'good', 'compared', 'most', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'coming', 'out', 'here', 'lately', 'film', 'everything', 'do', ""n't"", 'truly', 'intelligent', 'dialogue', 'real', 'laugh', 'minute', 'genuine', 'heart', 'never', 'sappy', 'key', 'Christian', 'Cooke', 'soon-to-be-big-star', 'ever', 'saw', 'one', 'who', 'own', 'way', 'here', 'even', 'when', 'playing', 'Fiennes', 'who', 'always', 'perfect', 'Cooke', 'completely', 'wraps', 'character', 'here', 'believable', 'point', 'love', 'interest', 'Felicity', 'Jones', 'likewise', 'winning', 'treat', 'watch', 'are', 'mates', 'especially', 'sly', 'Tom', 'Hughes.The', 'script', 'tight', 'unforced', 'fits', 'exactly', 'right', 'amount', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'moving', 'story', 'briskly', 'old', 'plot', 'done', 'very', 'nicely', 'little', 'be', 'desired', 'interesting', 'watching', 'extras', ""'re"", 'mostly', 'excellent', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'film', 'Gervais', 'Merchant', 'were', 'wise', 'cut', 'things', 'along', 'just', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'almost', 'dead', 'moments.Gervais', 'hilarious', 'Cooke', 'Dad', 'grandma', 'played', 'hilt', 'Anne', 'Reid', 'kind', 'character', 'actor', 'Britain', 'always', 'been', 'adept', 'producing', 'extremely', 'skilled', 'creating', 'persona', 'just', 'few', 'lines', 'just', 'chip', 'store', 'owner', 'here', 'brief', 'turns', 'talented', 'people', 'abound', 'CJ', 'are', 'part', 'true', 'charm.If', 'grew', 'up', 'early', '70s', 'and/or', 'knew', 'Britain', 'back', 'then', 'did', ""'m"", 'biased', 'towards', 'story', 'Cemetery', 'Junction', 'will', 'ring', 'many', 'bells', 'little', 'details', 'are', 'spot', 'score', 'songs', 'language', 'clothes', 'sets', 'feels', 'very', 'real', 'never', 'fake', 'make', 'standard', 'story', 'children', 'becoming', 'adults', 'more', 'poignant', 'predictable', 'ending', 'also', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'everyone', 'getting', 'what', 'deserve', 'especially', 'when', 'best.I', 'think', 'few', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'seen', 'true', 'classic', 'way', 'warm', 'winning', 'very', 'funny', 'moments', 'easily', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedy', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'moon.Gervais', 'clearly', 'softy', 'heart', 'as', 'well', 'fine', 'writer', 'capable', 'director', 'Cemetery', 'Junction', 'can', 'sit', 'comfortably', 'next', 'Office', 'shelf', 'true', 'modern', 'classic', 'quiet', 'unassumingly', 'sweet', 'often', 'hilarious']",N/A

Snork, the dork,  would be blissfully happy if only he could (a) find a girl to love him and then (b) someday rise to the rank of Station Master of the Cemetery Junction railway station.  Bruce is too consumed with anger to care about  love, career or happiness; he just wants to hop a train and get as far away as he can from the dad he's never forgiven for letting his mom get away all those years ago.  And then there's Freddie.  What Freddie wants most fervently is to not end up like his dad (Gervais), sleepwalking his life away in a dead-end job at the local whatzit  factory with nothing to show for it. At first Freddie thinks the answer is putting on a suit and tie and  following in the footsteps of his new mentor, (Ralph Fiennes), who escaped Cemetery Junction years ago to  run a life insurance  agency and now lives high off the hog. But, for the moment at least,  dreams are taking these three lovable clods exactly nowhere--it's just joyless workdays, then a pub crawl, usually followed by a bar fight, followed by release from jail the next morning, and perchance a friendly reminder from dear old Granny that ""you'll never amount to anything,"" just in time to start the whole cycle over again.Then fate intervenes...in the form of a besotted waitress, a kind-hearted codger copper, and a grieving widow who causes Freddie to see the light and set an escape plan in motion.The three young stars--Christian Cooke, Tom Hughes and Jack Doolan--are all terrific--as are Felicity Jones (who starred in ""Northanger Abbey"") as the little girl with big dreams Freddie has loved since he was 12 and the brilliant Emily Watson as her beleaguered mom.
