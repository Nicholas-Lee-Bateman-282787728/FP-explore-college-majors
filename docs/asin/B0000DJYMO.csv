779088,A36OGGJQKZ4SGI,B0000DJYMO,"matthewslaughter ""matthewslaughter""","[5, 7]","David Cross's ""Let America Laugh"" is a behind-the-scenes documentary that surveys his experiences during two comedy tours in 2001 and 2002.  The documentary footage is framed by fictional material featuring David Cross married father working for a reputable advertising firm.  This material, like the documentary footage, is intermitently funny.  In ""Let America Laugh,"" we get to see Cross perform in front of drunken, irritable audiences, confront hecklers and club-owners, attend to promotional matters, smart-mouth interviewers, awkwardly interact with fans and join the cast of ""Mr. Show"" for a DVD signing at a Virgin Megastore.  Cross is generally a likeable person but he can be incredibly rude to those he has no respect for--like Bob Dylan in the 1967 documentary ""Don't Look Back.""  This makes for some good humor at times--especially when dealing with an interviewer (wearing a Thrasher sweatshirt) who has taken all his questions from an earlier interview Cross had done.  At other times, he seems condescending.  The ""Mr. Show"" signing is interesting, as Cross shows up late, and Bob Odenkirk writes humorous, less-than-nice things about him on glossy photos of the cast.  If Cross would have emphasized the iconoclastic approach to his comedy tour--avoiding typical comedy venues and instead performing with a band (Ultrababyfat) in small rock clubs and bars--this documentary might seem more substantial and subversive.  Worth owning for David Cross fans, it is too inconsistent for neophytes.  Also, there are some Easter eggs that are incredibly funny, including Bob and David listening to a keyboard-created CD of flatulence.",3,"Stand-up comedy's ""Don't Look Back""",1069459200,"11 22, 2003",2003,1644,"['David', 'Cross', 'Let', 'America', 'Laugh', 'behind-the-scenes', 'documentary', 'surveys', 'experiences', 'two', 'comedy', 'tours', '2001', '2002', 'documentary', 'footage', 'framed', 'fictional', 'material', 'featuring', 'David', 'Cross', 'married', 'father', 'working', 'reputable', 'advertising', 'firm', 'material', 'documentary', 'footage', 'intermitently', 'funny', 'Let', 'America', 'Laugh', 'get', 'see', 'Cross', 'perform', 'front', 'drunken', 'irritable', 'audiences', 'confront', 'hecklers', 'club-owners', 'attend', 'promotional', 'matters', 'smart-mouth', 'interviewers', 'awkwardly', 'interact', 'fans', 'join', 'cast', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'DVD', 'signing', 'Virgin', 'Megastore', 'Cross', 'generally', 'likeable', 'person', 'can', 'be', 'incredibly', 'rude', 'respect', 'Bob', 'Dylan', '1967', 'documentary', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'good', 'humor', 'times', 'especially', 'when', 'dealing', 'interviewer', 'wearing', 'Thrasher', 'sweatshirt', 'who', 'taken', 'questions', 'earlier', 'interview', 'Cross', 'had', 'done', 'other', 'times', 'condescending', 'Mr.', 'Show', 'signing', 'interesting', 'Cross', 'up', 'late', 'Bob', 'Odenkirk', 'humorous', 'less-than-nice', 'things', 'glossy', 'photos', 'cast', 'Cross', 'would', 'have', 'emphasized', 'iconoclastic', 'approach', 'comedy', 'tour', 'avoiding', 'typical', 'comedy', 'venues', 'instead', 'performing', 'band', 'Ultrababyfat', 'small', 'rock', 'clubs', 'bars', 'documentary', 'might', 'seem', 'more', 'substantial', 'subversive', 'Worth', 'owning', 'David', 'Cross', 'fans', 'too', 'inconsistent', 'neophytes', 'Also', 'are', 'Easter', 'eggs', 'are', 'incredibly', 'funny', 'including', 'Bob', 'David', 'listening', 'keyboard-created', 'CD', 'flatulence']",N/A
