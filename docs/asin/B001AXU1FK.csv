His expressions are what make his jokes all that much funnier.  He talks about how stupid and clueless he is about life and i can completely relate to him lol.  If youve never heard him before check this one out, its not his best one but its still very funny and a lot better than some of the other comedians out there.  The dvd is better than the cd obviously bc sometimes to really get the most out of the joke you have to see the way he acts, its hilarious.

This, his 3rd DVD, is a great performance, though it's not as good as his previous releases. There are some genuinely funny routines (the ""JFK ride"", intelligent life on Neptune), but many are not quite there. It's also sad to see him starting to include more profanity in his act. We're not talking ""Chris Rock"" here (he only says ""What the h-"" about 8 times), but if you compare this to his CD, it's a lot, which is a shame because he has always been this really clean comedian.The performance is 42 minutes long. If you saw it on Comedy Central there's really no reason to buy this as the only extras are a 3 1/2 minute encore where he does a couple of old bits, and a behind-the-scenes shoot. It doesn't warrant a purchase, unlike his last CC DVD which had extra performance material.If you didn't see this on TV and own his last 2 DVDs and his CD, you'll still want to pick this up.

I thought it was funny.His routine is just about the day-to-day stuff we go through, but with a comedic twist of course.There's lots of good stuff here like....if reading makes people so smart, then why do they need the title of the book at the top of every page?  He also  talks about ideas for a new ballet story...how a realistic cooking show  would  look like...the lunacy of pet psychics...and more.He sometimes stays too long with jokes and some of the jokes were just okay.

I recently watched this episode as thought it was hilarious, but Standing Up might be a little better. His comedy routine is mostly based on his physical demeanor and facial expressions, and his material covers much of what we think of as ordinary life stuff, but he can take this and make it funny with his goofiness. The Epitome of Hyperbole has some bits that are funnier than others, but overall most of the material was funny. Unlike most comedians, Brian Regan I can watch over and over. Some of the subjects he uses: learning to read, being smart, lazy writing, mingling at parties, judging art, crimes, jury duty, intelligent life on other planets, the differences between men and women.One of the funniest parts is when he is talking about crimes, comparing loitering to manslaughter. ""Is something really a crime when it's remedied as easily as `all right, move along'?""""What are you in for?""""Loitering. I'm like you. I live on the edge!""Another funny segment is him talking about jury duty selection, and how the process to get out of it becomes like a game show.It's nice to hear a comedian who doesn't have to use the ""f"" word to get laughs.

The performance warrants a five star rating, but the show is only 42 minutes long, and the encore is much shorter than his standard (it's only four minutes long, and isn't especially strong, but was essentially an ""audience request"" format).
