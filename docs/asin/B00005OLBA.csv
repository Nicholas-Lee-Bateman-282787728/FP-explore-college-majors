672634,A3HVEEJ621849Q,B00005OLBA,A viewer,"[2, 4]","It was a nice idea and had potential.  But this film is so uncheerful and filled with unpleasant people, if Ebeneezer Scrooge had watched it on Christmas Eve, the ghosts of Chirstmasn past, present, and future would have joined him in saying ""BAH, HUMBUG!""Here is the story:  Jonathan, an early 20-something gay man is haunted by the death of his parents when he was 8 and, partly to cope, still believes in Santa Claus.  He lives with his sister, Marie, and essentially waits for his life to begin.  The day after Thanksgiving, he writes Santa asking him for a boyfriend, particularly a cute southerner.  Well, the next day, in walks Toby, a guy who fits that description, applying for a job in the gay bookstore where he works.  Believing Santa has answered his wish, he persues the guy of his dreams, but the object of his infatuation already has a boyfriend, uptight, suspicious Keith.  And the story goes from there.It had possibilities, but rarely makes good use of them.  Part of the problem is the very low budget, which would embarrass a porn production.  The lighting and sound are bad, and the editing and film quality leave much to be desired.  But even worse is writer/director Kiernan Turner's story and characters.  Jonathan is a sullen, immature, self-pitying pothead.  And the supporting characters are no better.  Everyone in this film is either rude, dumb, selfish, and/or noisy.  Maybe the last part is because the sound is so bad, the actors felt the need to shout their lines.The actors are no better.  Kevin Isola is convincing as a pothead, but other than that he sulks throughout the movie and never gives us a reason to care about his character. Aida Turturro (of ""The Sopranos"") basically shouts her lines, and treats us to more Italian stereotypes than an Olive Garden commercial.  It's laughable for them to be portraying brother and sister.  With his mushy California mumble and her thick Noo Yawk accent, I couldn't believe they grew up in the same state, let alone the same house.  Embarrassing, unintentional comic relief comes from David Burtka as the object of Jonathan's desire.  His performance consists of a bug-eyed, goofy grin and bogus, honey-chile' accent.  Jim Neighbors fans will be happy to know that Gomer Pyle is alive and living in New York City.  And, oh, the poor Stephen Mailer.  A nice-looking and likeable actor, he's stuck in the thankless role of Burtka's insecure, uptight boyfriend.  With his rigid posture and grin-and-bear it manner, it's obvious that Mailer is bored and embarrassed.  I was hoping he'd appear shirtless, to see whether he was wearing a back brace.  He performance screans, ""I can't wait till the filming is over so I can fire my agent.""  His attitude is understandable, but doesn't make the film any more entertaining.What's sad about this is not only the good premise, but the fact that a few moments are quite good.  The scene where Jonathan mistakes a woman for his deceased mother and follows her to a store Christmas display is genuinely moving.  Some of the quiet moments, like Marie confiding how much she cares about her brother or Keith reaching out to someone he once considered his rival, make us briefly care about them.  And some of the humor is laugh-out-loud funny.  These give you a sense of what could have been.  But there just aren't enough of them.",2,Give Kiernan Turner A Lump Of Coal,1132876800,"11 25, 2005",2005,3345,"['was', 'nice', 'idea', 'had', 'potential', 'film', 'so', 'uncheerful', 'filled', 'unpleasant', 'people', 'Ebeneezer', 'Scrooge', 'had', 'watched', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'ghosts', 'Chirstmasn', 'past', 'present', 'future', 'would', 'have', 'joined', 'saying', 'BAH', 'HUMBUG', 'Here', 'story', 'Jonathan', 'early', '20-something', 'gay', 'man', 'haunted', 'death', 'parents', 'when', 'was', '8', 'partly', 'cope', 'still', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'sister', 'Marie', 'essentially', 'waits', 'life', 'begin', 'day', 'Thanksgiving', 'Santa', 'asking', 'boyfriend', 'particularly', 'cute', 'southerner', 'Well', 'next', 'day', 'walks', 'Toby', 'guy', 'who', 'description', 'applying', 'job', 'gay', 'bookstore', 'where', 'Believing', 'Santa', 'answered', 'wish', 'guy', 'dreams', 'object', 'infatuation', 'already', 'boyfriend', 'uptight', 'suspicious', 'Keith', 'story', 'there.It', 'had', 'possibilities', 'rarely', 'good', 'use', 'Part', 'problem', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'would', 'embarrass', 'porn', 'production', 'lighting', 'sound', 'are', 'bad', 'editing', 'film', 'quality', 'leave', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'even', 'worse', 'writer/director', 'Kiernan', 'Turner', 'story', 'characters', 'Jonathan', 'sullen', 'immature', 'self-pitying', 'pothead', 'supporting', 'characters', 'are', 'better', 'Everyone', 'film', 'rude', 'dumb', 'selfish', 'and/or', 'noisy', 'Maybe', 'last', 'part', 'sound', 'so', 'bad', 'actors', 'felt', 'need', 'shout', 'lines.The', 'actors', 'are', 'better', 'Kevin', 'Isola', 'convincing', 'pothead', 'other', 'movie', 'never', 'reason', 'care', 'character', 'Aida', 'Turturro', 'Sopranos', 'basically', 'lines', 'more', 'Italian', 'stereotypes', 'Olive', 'Garden', 'commercial', 'laughable', 'be', 'portraying', 'brother', 'sister', 'mushy', 'California', 'mumble', 'thick', 'Noo', 'Yawk', 'accent', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'grew', 'up', 'same', 'state', 'let', 'alone', 'same', 'house', 'Embarrassing', 'unintentional', 'comic', 'relief', 'David', 'Burtka', 'object', 'Jonathan', 'desire', 'performance', 'bug-eyed', 'goofy', 'grin', 'bogus', 'honey-chile', 'accent', 'Jim', 'Neighbors', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'happy', 'know', 'Gomer', 'Pyle', 'alive', 'living', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'oh', 'poor', 'Stephen', 'Mailer', 'nice-looking', 'likeable', 'actor', 'stuck', 'thankless', 'role', 'Burtka', 'insecure', 'uptight', 'boyfriend', 'rigid', 'posture', 'grin-and-bear', 'manner', 'obvious', 'Mailer', 'bored', 'embarrassed', 'was', 'hoping', ""'d"", 'appear', 'shirtless', 'see', 'was', 'wearing', 'back', 'brace', 'performance', 'screans', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'till', 'filming', 'can', 'fire', 'agent', 'attitude', 'understandable', ""n't"", 'make', 'film', 'more', 'entertaining.What', 'sad', 'not', 'only', 'good', 'premise', 'fact', 'few', 'moments', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'scene', 'where', 'Jonathan', 'woman', 'deceased', 'mother', 'store', 'Christmas', 'display', 'genuinely', 'moving', 'quiet', 'moments', 'Marie', 'confiding', 'how', 'much', 'brother', 'Keith', 'reaching', 'out', 'someone', 'once', 'considered', 'rival', 'make', 'briefly', 'care', 'humor', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'give', 'sense', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'just', 'are', ""n't"", 'enough']",N/A

Does he get what he deserves in the end?  You be the judge of that.

I think that it could have been more. The character developement was just not complete. There was however a simple beauty that came out in the end. I loved the ending. This is not something for everyone, but a true movie lover will be able to see that it could be considered a diamond in the rough.",3,Indie okay,1049328000,"04 3, 2003",2003,426,"['was', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'was', 'recommended', 'bought', 'primarily', 'price', 'story', 'line', 'was', 'good', 'think', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'character', 'developement', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'complete', 'was', 'however', 'simple', 'beauty', 'came', 'out', 'end', 'loved', 'ending', 'not', 'something', 'everyone', 'true', 'movie', 'lover', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'diamond', 'rough']",N/A

All the negative reviews remind me that so many people always view the glass as half empty.Has the message of this movie been presented before?  Yes, hundreds of times.  The message being that something what you hunt for is something right in front of you that you don't even recognize.But this theme was put into the ""____ shopping days until Christmas"" format and it turns into a simple and delightful film.  Of course the main character is moody--he is single, living with his sister who raised him because his parents died/disappeared.  It's a sad existance.So Jonathon does something so cute and sappy...he writes to Santa Claus and asks for a boyfriend.  He thinks his Christmas wish was granted when a young man with a Southern accent appears at the book store and asks for a job...could there be a more blatant sign?But Jonathon was wrong.  He found love with another man once he let go of his preconceived notions and opened his heart.",5,"Sweet, delightful, fun, touching, insightful",1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,991,"['Yes', 'think', '24', 'Nights', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'negative', 'reviews', 'remind', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'always', 'view', 'glass', 'half', 'message', 'movie', 'been', 'presented', 'Yes', 'hundreds', 'times', 'message', 'being', 'something', 'what', 'hunt', 'something', 'right', 'front', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'recognize.But', 'theme', 'was', 'put', '____', 'shopping', 'days', 'Christmas', 'format', 'simple', 'delightful', 'film', 'course', 'main', 'character', 'moody', 'single', 'living', 'sister', 'who', 'raised', 'parents', 'died/disappeared', 'sad', 'existance.So', 'Jonathon', 'something', 'so', 'cute', 'sappy', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'boyfriend', 'Christmas', 'wish', 'was', 'granted', 'when', 'young', 'man', 'Southern', 'accent', 'book', 'store', 'asks', 'job', 'could', 'there', 'be', 'more', 'blatant', 'sign', 'Jonathon', 'was', 'wrong', 'found', 'love', 'man', 'once', 'let', 'go', 'preconceived', 'notions', 'opened', 'heart']",N/A
