998071,A1Q1V4F9610DB5,B000G1ALGQ,Music Lover in Omaha,"[3, 3]","Yes, at some time or another in this production, every cast member does some mugging for the audience.  Some more than others.  Some of it is down right shameless.  The thing is, I saw a portion of this on the ARTS cable network before I bought it and read the reviews here so I had an idea what I was getting.  I got exactly what I expected.  This DVD gives you excellent performers (maybe not great actors) but fantastic performers.  The biggest ham is John English as the pirate king.  His interplay with the conductor is terrific and as other reviewers have stated, he is not taking his role seriously.  If however, you watch the performance it is obvious that every move has been rehearsed over and over and that all these spontaneous acts come off flawlessly.  Derek Metzger as the major-general was a bit annoying with his extra antics, but I could live with that.  Tim Tyler as the sergeant did a nice job but I especailly enjoyed his bit with (I think they were ping-pong balls)after his first entrance.  Simon Gallaher as Frederic was great and Helen Donaldson was the first Maybel I've ever seen that actually seemed to have a personality.  Most Maybels are just there looking cute and singing.  She actually used expressions starting with her first entrance:  Yes it's Maaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy Bel!  Then she got in to the part with the marching song.  Hmmm..Good acting and a nice voice. Nice concept.  I also would be neglectful if I did not mention the 3 daughters of the Major-General.  They indeed tend to chew up the scenery when they were on, but those ladies had some talent!!! This DVD provided exactly what I expected and what I hoped for when I ordered it.  This is just 115 minutes of fun.  Even the opening overture starts out with the cast having fun with Gilbert and Sullivan.  I've read that G & S purists might not like this production.  I don't know what a G & S purist is.  I love Gilbert and Sullivan and this version did not offend me at all.  Maybe I'm not a purist.  If you're not a 'purist', don't miss this version of Pirates of Penzance.  If you enjoy it once, you will want to watch it again...and again...and again...and...well, you get it.  This is an easy DVD to recommend.",5,Awesome over the top fun,1227744000,"11 27, 2008",2008,2213,"['Yes', 'time', 'production', 'cast', 'member', 'mugging', 'audience', 'more', 'others', 'down', 'right', 'shameless', 'thing', 'saw', 'portion', 'ARTS', 'cable', 'network', 'bought', 'read', 'reviews', 'here', 'so', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'getting', 'got', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'performers', 'maybe', 'not', 'great', 'actors', 'fantastic', 'performers', 'biggest', 'ham', 'John', 'English', 'pirate', 'king', 'interplay', 'conductor', 'terrific', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'stated', 'not', 'taking', 'role', 'seriously', 'however', 'watch', 'performance', 'obvious', 'move', 'been', 'rehearsed', 'spontaneous', 'acts', 'come', 'off', 'flawlessly', 'Derek', 'Metzger', 'major-general', 'was', 'bit', 'annoying', 'extra', 'antics', 'could', 'live', 'Tim', 'Tyler', 'sergeant', 'did', 'nice', 'job', 'especailly', 'enjoyed', 'bit', 'think', 'were', 'ping-pong', 'balls', 'first', 'entrance', 'Simon', 'Gallaher', 'Frederic', 'was', 'great', 'Helen', 'Donaldson', 'was', 'first', 'Maybel', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'actually', 'seemed', 'have', 'personality', 'Most', 'Maybels', 'are', 'just', 'there', 'looking', 'cute', 'singing', 'actually', 'used', 'expressions', 'starting', 'first', 'entrance', 'Maaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy', 'Bel', 'Then', 'got', 'part', 'marching', 'song', 'Hmmm..Good', 'acting', 'nice', 'voice', 'Nice', 'concept', 'also', 'would', 'be', 'neglectful', 'did', 'not', 'mention', '3', 'daughters', 'Major-General', 'indeed', 'tend', 'chew', 'up', 'scenery', 'when', 'were', 'ladies', 'had', 'talent', 'DVD', 'provided', 'exactly', 'what', 'expected', 'what', 'hoped', 'when', 'ordered', 'just', '115', 'minutes', 'fun', 'Even', 'opening', 'overture', 'out', 'cast', 'having', 'fun', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', ""'ve"", 'read', 'G', 'S', 'purists', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'production', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'G', 'S', 'purist', 'love', 'Gilbert', 'Sullivan', 'version', 'did', 'not', 'offend', 'Maybe', ""'m"", 'not', 'purist', ""'re"", 'not', ""'purist"", 'do', ""n't"", 'miss', 'version', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'enjoy', 'once', 'will', 'want', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'well', 'get', 'easy', 'DVD', 'recommend']","Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance / Jon English, Simon Gallaher, Helen Donaldson, Toni Lamond, Derek Metzger, Tim Tyler, Craig Schaffer"
998072,A1GQGYROVZVW49,B000G1ALGQ,P. Schmidt,"[0, 0]","This DVD is a video of a live stage performance of Pirates of Penzance. There is clearly an audience present, and although the camera work is good, there remains a lot of stage ambiance that sometimes distracts.The main reason that I recommend this DVD is for the performance of the two romantic leads, Simon Gallaher as Frederic and Helen Donaldson as Mabel. I don't think you will find a better set if pipes and appropriate singing styles in any other DVD version of this operetta. Simon looks the part and has a fine bel canto voice that perfectly suits the part, and Donaldson not only looks lovely but sings the part with the voice of a goddess. Their acting also holds up just fine.My main reservation is with Jon English as the Pirate King. Physically, and in terms of costume, he looks the part, with the exception of a mullet haircut and Steve Tyler swagger that constantly makes one think of an aging rock star who wandered onto the stage. English basically performs the part well enough, picking up many bits from Kevin Kline's famous Papp production performances, and while his singing voice in not as good as anyone else's, and not as good as Kline's it is serviceable. And he is a gifted physical comedian, performing many falls, including down stairs, that are funny indeed. He does sometimes act as though the story is about his character, and this might be the fault of the director.The actor playing Major General Stanley plays the part well, but looks totally wrong, more like a skinny teenager who glued on a set of muttonchops.The roles of the police men are all well handled and funny, although the police captain's singing voice is a bit weak.The biggest change is that if Mabel's sisters. Here they are played by a trio of women who are billed only by a group name, ""The Singlettes"" as I recall, as if they were an imported singing/comedy act, and maybe that's what they are. They don't look the part, with inappropriate costumes and hair styles, and they seem to be channeling Cinderella's three wicked sisters. But they ARE a scream comedically, and they sing all the sisters' lines in three part harmony that, while not original to B&S;, does fit and seems appropriate, and they sing very well. My major beef with them is that their roles, especially during ""Oh, Is there not one maiden breast"", are elevated to the point where they are a distraction from the song.So, a worthy Pirates, and worth having, but not without its flaws.As with the Papp production that is so widely used as a model for modern performances of Pirates, liberties are taken with the lyrics and score here and there.",4,"Very good, though flawed, Pirates performance",1341878400,"07 10, 2012",2012,2617,"['DVD', 'video', 'live', 'stage', 'performance', 'Pirates', 'Penzance', 'clearly', 'audience', 'present', 'camera', 'work', 'good', 'lot', 'stage', 'ambiance', 'distracts.The', 'main', 'reason', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'performance', 'two', 'romantic', 'leads', 'Simon', 'Gallaher', 'Frederic', 'Helen', 'Donaldson', 'Mabel', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'find', 'better', 'set', 'pipes', 'appropriate', 'singing', 'styles', 'other', 'DVD', 'version', 'operetta', 'Simon', 'part', 'fine', 'bel', 'canto', 'voice', 'perfectly', 'suits', 'part', 'Donaldson', 'not', 'only', 'lovely', 'part', 'voice', 'goddess', 'acting', 'also', 'up', 'just', 'fine.My', 'main', 'reservation', 'Jon', 'English', 'Pirate', 'King', 'Physically', 'terms', 'costume', 'part', 'exception', 'mullet', 'haircut', 'Steve', 'Tyler', 'swagger', 'constantly', 'one', 'think', 'aging', 'rock', 'star', 'who', 'wandered', 'stage', 'English', 'basically', 'part', 'well', 'enough', 'picking', 'up', 'many', 'bits', 'Kevin', 'Kline', 'famous', 'Papp', 'production', 'performances', 'singing', 'voice', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'anyone', 'else', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'Kline', 'serviceable', 'gifted', 'physical', 'comedian', 'performing', 'many', 'falls', 'including', 'down', 'stairs', 'are', 'funny', 'indeed', 'sometimes', 'act', 'story', 'character', 'might', 'be', 'fault', 'director.The', 'actor', 'playing', 'Major', 'General', 'Stanley', 'part', 'well', 'totally', 'wrong', 'more', 'skinny', 'teenager', 'who', 'glued', 'set', 'muttonchops.The', 'roles', 'police', 'men', 'are', 'well', 'handled', 'funny', 'police', 'captain', 'singing', 'voice', 'bit', 'weak.The', 'biggest', 'change', 'Mabel', 'sisters', 'Here', 'are', 'played', 'trio', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'billed', 'only', 'group', 'name', 'Singlettes', 'recall', 'were', 'imported', 'singing/comedy', 'act', 'maybe', 'what', 'are', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'part', 'inappropriate', 'costumes', 'hair', 'styles', 'seem', 'be', 'channeling', 'Cinderella', 'three', 'wicked', 'sisters', 'ARE', 'scream', 'comedically', 'sing', 'sisters', 'lines', 'three', 'part', 'harmony', 'not', 'original', 'B', 'S', 'fit', 'appropriate', 'sing', 'very', 'well', 'major', 'beef', 'roles', 'especially', 'Oh', 'Is', 'there', 'not', 'one', 'maiden', 'breast', 'are', 'elevated', 'point', 'where', 'are', 'distraction', 'song.So', 'worthy', 'Pirates', 'worth', 'having', 'not', 'flaws.As', 'Papp', 'production', 'so', 'widely', 'used', 'model', 'modern', 'performances', 'Pirates', 'liberties', 'are', 'taken', 'lyrics', 'score', 'here', 'there']","Gilbert & Sullivan - The Pirates of Penzance / Jon English, Simon Gallaher, Helen Donaldson, Toni Lamond, Derek Metzger, Tim Tyler, Craig Schaffer"
