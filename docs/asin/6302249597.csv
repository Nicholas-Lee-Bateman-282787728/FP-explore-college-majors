303775,A2RST4Y2LXRQW5,6302249597,Avery Hemming,"[9, 10]","Five doctors go camping and wake up the next morning discovering that their boots are gone. Unfortunately, the mysterious stranger has a deadly agenda towards the group of doctors.  This morbid person will bump them off one at a time.  The survivors are trying to figure out who is after them and why.  The final survivor will face off with the mysterious stranger when all is revealed.If I'm correct, this movie was made in 1976.  It was also known as ""The Creeper.""  I never heard of this movie until I read an article about it in the ""Rue Morgue"" nearly two years ago.  I was very anxious to see this movie and I'm glad I own it!  I've never seen a movie like this before and it's too bad that it is not very well known.  It's a very simple movie filmed in Canada.The ""Rituals"" is a slow movie, with a sense of doom.  The atypical music is not what I expect to hear but yet it works just fine in the movie.  The location is perfect: being lost in the middle of nowhere very far away from modern civilization.  A perfect setting for being trapped with no chance for help.You're not going to see the killer running after his victims and hacking them away.  He waits for the right moment to strike and bump off the remaining survivors; effectively shattering their level headed approach to everyday life.  They're confused, angry, and losing their patience very quickly.  The results are not good for the victims and I don't want to reveal the horrors they encounter.  You have to see for yourself what happens and I think you'll agree that the approach is much better than the common horror movies.This movie should not be compared to ""Deliverance"" because the approach and situation is totally different from one another.  The only similarity they have is the ""backwoods"" label.  Also, I would not recommend this movie to someone who are expecting a fast paced movie, female nudity (there are no females in this movie) or even explicit gore.  It was not needed and it did fine without any one of those typical elements found in a horror movie.This is an excellent 70's horror movie and for me, one of the best ""backwoods slasher"" movie ever made.  If you don't like it watching it for the first time, try again after some time pass by.  Maybe you'll like it better the second around.The best print version of ""Rituals"" is only from Code Red and no one else.  I believe Code Red restored the movie best as possible even though there will be some scratches on the screen.  Overall, just think of watching a print with a grindhouse style.  You can actually see what's going on compared to the videocassette version or a previous version released by another company many years ago on dvd.  For example, I couldn't see very well what the killer looked like near the end of the movie.  Thanks to Code Red, the appearance of the ugly character is loud and clear.  Also, there's an extra feature on the dvd where you can watch a somewhat interesting ""interview"" with two of the ""Rituals"" actors:  Lawrence Dand and Robin Gammell.",5,Thank you Code Red for finally releasing this movie on dvd!,1304985600,"05 10, 2011",2011,3023,"['Five', 'doctors', 'go', 'camping', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'discovering', 'boots', 'are', 'gone', 'Unfortunately', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'deadly', 'agenda', 'group', 'doctors', 'morbid', 'person', 'will', 'bump', 'off', 'one', 'time', 'survivors', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'who', 'why', 'final', 'survivor', 'will', 'face', 'off', 'mysterious', 'stranger', 'when', 'revealed.If', ""'m"", 'correct', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1976', 'was', 'also', 'known', 'Creeper', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'read', 'article', 'Rue', 'Morgue', 'nearly', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'very', 'anxious', 'see', 'movie', ""'m"", 'glad', 'own', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'movie', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'very', 'well', 'known', 'very', 'simple', 'movie', 'filmed', 'Canada.The', 'Rituals', 'slow', 'movie', 'sense', 'doom', 'atypical', 'music', 'not', 'what', 'expect', 'hear', 'yet', 'just', 'fine', 'movie', 'location', 'perfect', 'being', 'lost', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'very', 'far', 'away', 'modern', 'civilization', 'perfect', 'setting', 'being', 'trapped', 'chance', 'help.You', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'see', 'killer', 'running', 'victims', 'hacking', 'away', 'right', 'moment', 'strike', 'bump', 'off', 'remaining', 'survivors', 'effectively', 'shattering', 'level', 'headed', 'approach', 'everyday', 'life', ""'re"", 'confused', 'angry', 'losing', 'patience', 'very', 'quickly', 'results', 'are', 'not', 'good', 'victims', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'reveal', 'horrors', 'encounter', 'have', 'see', 'what', 'think', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'approach', 'much', 'better', 'common', 'horror', 'movies.This', 'movie', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'Deliverance', 'approach', 'situation', 'totally', 'different', 'one', 'only', 'similarity', 'have', 'backwoods', 'label', 'Also', 'would', 'not', 'recommend', 'movie', 'someone', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'fast', 'paced', 'movie', 'female', 'nudity', 'are', 'females', 'movie', 'even', 'explicit', 'gore', 'was', 'not', 'needed', 'did', 'fine', 'one', 'typical', 'elements', 'found', 'horror', 'movie.This', 'excellent', '70', 'horror', 'movie', 'one', 'best', 'backwoods', 'slasher', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'watching', 'first', 'time', 'try', 'again', 'time', 'pass', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'like', 'better', 'second', 'around.The', 'best', 'print', 'version', 'Rituals', 'only', 'Code', 'Red', 'one', 'else', 'believe', 'Code', 'Red', 'restored', 'movie', 'best', 'possible', 'even', 'will', 'be', 'scratches', 'screen', 'Overall', 'just', 'think', 'watching', 'print', 'grindhouse', 'style', 'can', 'actually', 'see', 'what', 'going', 'compared', 'videocassette', 'version', 'previous', 'version', 'released', 'company', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'dvd', 'example', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'very', 'well', 'what', 'killer', 'looked', 'end', 'movie', 'Thanks', 'Code', 'Red', 'appearance', 'ugly', 'character', 'loud', 'clear', 'Also', 'extra', 'feature', 'dvd', 'where', 'can', 'watch', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'interview', 'two', 'Rituals', 'actors', 'Lawrence', 'Dand', 'Robin', 'Gammell']",Rituals VHS

303779,A2YM9ILTAX0782,6302249597,"Birt Acres ""Cinemaniac""","[1, 4]","""Rituals"" (1978) is a poorly filmed, poorly scripted, though not entirely unsuccessful rip-off of ""Deliverance.""  Most of the ""Deliverance"" rip-offs make the same mistake:  throwing their characters to the insane ruralites before we even care for the characters.  ""Deliverance"" gives us ample time to realize that Ed and Lewis and Drew and Bobby are a whole lot like us, so much so that when Bobby is assaulted we wince with sympathetic pain.  ""Rituals"" simply drops its five M.D. protagonists into the deep mountains of Canada and has them almost immediately stalked by an unknown assailant.  While this lack of explanation may have sounded great in the planning room, on the screen it has the effect of deflating any tension we may have otherwise felt.  Who's stalking these guys?  Who cares--I don't know these guys anyway.  There are a few scary moments, and the movie does try to be more important than it is, but ultimately it is a poor copy of a great movie.  I would, however, track it down if you're a fan of the ""urban man vs. the rural"" subgenre (""Deliverance,"" ""Southern Comfort,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" et al).",3,"One of the Better ""Deliverance"" Rip-Offs",1331337600,"03 10, 2012",2012,1127,"['Rituals', '1978', 'poorly', 'filmed', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'not', 'entirely', 'unsuccessful', 'rip-off', 'Deliverance', 'Most', 'Deliverance', 'rip-offs', 'make', 'same', 'mistake', 'throwing', 'characters', 'insane', 'even', 'care', 'characters', 'Deliverance', 'ample', 'time', 'realize', 'Ed', 'Lewis', 'Drew', 'Bobby', 'are', 'whole', 'lot', 'so', 'much', 'when', 'Bobby', 'assaulted', 'wince', 'sympathetic', 'pain', 'Rituals', 'simply', 'five', 'M.D', 'protagonists', 'deep', 'mountains', 'Canada', 'almost', 'immediately', 'stalked', 'unknown', 'assailant', 'lack', 'explanation', 'may', 'have', 'sounded', 'great', 'planning', 'room', 'screen', 'effect', 'deflating', 'tension', 'may', 'have', 'otherwise', 'felt', 'Who', 'stalking', 'guys', 'Who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'guys', 'anyway', 'are', 'few', 'scary', 'moments', 'movie', 'try', 'be', 'more', 'important', 'ultimately', 'poor', 'copy', 'great', 'movie', 'would', 'however', 'track', 'down', ""'re"", 'fan', 'urban', 'man', 'rural', 'subgenre', 'Deliverance', 'Southern', 'Comfort', 'Texas', 'Chainsaw', 'Massacre', 'al']",Rituals VHS

303781,A23BM0H6HYQK01,6302249597,Eduardo Hernandez,"[0, 0]","Rituals is a forest survival movie, that is seems to predate the Friday the 13th films, but with a more mature audience in mind, instead of the teens that came by the truckloads to the theaters to watch the slashers of the 80's. Five men go to a camping trip, but then become followed by a stranger that isn't revealed till the end, yet this person is deadly. A great film worth watching for someone who is in mood for a film that is in the style of Deliverance.Code Red released this film and when it dropped, a lot of people complained of the damage to the print that were VERY noticeable. I kept that in my head when I purchased it, and to my surprise, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Sure it's clearly damaged, but the damage doesn't seem to bother me. The audio is decent enough to understand everyone (not crystal clear), and the only part that becomes difficult to see is near the end (yet that seems to be a problem that occurred way before Code Red was even involved).This film is going for quite a bit of cash, so I suggest searching around for the right price.

303782,A315I4RKNVTUYJ,6302249597,"Harlem Champ ""Harlem Champ""","[1, 2]","I was a kid when i first saw Rituals on WOR-TV (channel 9), NYC TV in the early 80's. It was a rainy saturday afternoon and it was a horror  double feature, teamed with the classic ""Tourist Trap.""  I had seen Tourist Trap before, and loved it's eerie and creepy  atmosphere, so after it finished, i decided to see what Rituals was all about. It stuck with me for the next 30 plus years.Of course i had seen deliverance before viewing Rituals, AND, actually read the book as well, but this was a different type of film, it carried itself uniquely, with it's own distinct atmosphere, and course. Let me express my perspective. I am often annoyed by this idea that Rituals is a copy... or a rip-off.  I believe those who use that phrase lack the ability to examine this film objectively, due to the reverence for Deliverance.  Aside from five doctors in ""Rituals"" and the four men in ""Deliverance"", and the wilderness, of course i will say that for those of you that so voraciously use the ""woods"" as such a powerful example of ""Rituals"" being a wanna-be ""Deliverance"", there isn't much similar between these two great films. At the start of Deliverance we understand the mountain-folks hostility towards Burt Reynolds and co, that much is quite clear from early on. We know whom John Voight is up against, and although there is suspense, the killers are defined. In Rituals, there is an unknown presence, that is quite enigmatic, not only do we wonder ""why"", we also yearn to know ""who"" and ""what"". Suspense in Rituals is not only coupled with terror, but it is tripled with the viewer being totally and fearfully clueless, until Holbrook and Dane speculate on their stalker, and even then we still have no idea, as to who and why.Should i argue the ""survival"" concept? Really? Aren't most horror films about survival? The victims rising above an insane adversity and element, to live to see a brighter day. So, we should examine the whole survival theory as well. It's too simplistic to say Rituals and deliverance are connected solely on survival-horror, that's a weak, surface analysis.Now in the context of actors and ""acting"". I will agree that Deliverance was superior in that category, ONLY because all four friends in Deliverance were superb actors, and in Rituals you only had one incredible actor.. Hal Holbrook. But, if we were to look at the caliber of Holbrook's slow building, and emotional performance in Rituals, it could be debated that he may have out-shone Reynolds, or Voight, dare yourself to examine that point. Lawerence Dane was good but not superior, but the performance of the openly gay character played by Robin Gammell is often overlooked.Yes, the plot and storyline in Deliverance was scripted much more effectively than that in Rituals, but the plots were still quite different. The characters being doctors in Rituals, were a key part to the plot. It ties in nicely, and is in no way similar to the plot in Deliverance. In Deliverance we wondered if they were going to make it off and out of that river. In Rituals we wondered what they were up against, if and when they could make it out of the wilderness..where would they make it too? The survival factors in Rituals were numerous, in addition to the fact that the remaining men trekked by foot, they also carried a corpse, there were no canoes in Rituals.. to coast them to safety.It is very possible that the producers and film makers of Rituals may have been influenced by Deliverance. In fact if you Rituals-bashers want to swear by that...by all means do so. Most films are influenced by others, thats just simply how it works, but to say that Rituals is a rip-off of Deliverance is an utterly, ignorant concept, that needs to be intensely re-examined.Rituals is a brilliant, and inexcusably underrated terror-film. The suspense and atmosphere are powerfully different from those in Deliverance, and the cinematography in my opinion is superior. I have seen many Hal Holbrook films, not all of his work, but i can say this is one of his most emotional performances. The killer in Rituals, is a stalking strategic predator, and his shadows and silhouettes that are seen sporadically are enough to nurture a growing fear in us until we meet him in the film's finale. Rituals is a film who's budget was considerably lower than that of deliverance, but it is still a quite different film and an extremely effective movie, in which i always find something new and unique every time i watch it. These two films shouldn't be compared at all.. they should both be individually praised for their effectiveness, dread-looming atmospheres, and individual terror filled contextual brilliance.I love Deliverance, it is a great film, and i have watched it numerous times. I also love Rituals and have such reverence for it as well, and own two copies of it. One unopened. Two very different films. It is Sunday evening, and i am conflicted on which one i will watch.. I think its going to be Rituals, i'll save deliverance for Monday...For those who haven't seen Rituals, your missing a thing of greatness...Peace",5,"Crushing the ""Deliverance"" comparison...

A ""Deliverance"" clone, this little Canadian thriller works very well and will keep you on the edge of your seat.6 friends(all Doctors) meet for their yearly retreat together and fly deep into the Canadian woods to go fishing and hiking. All of these guys have problems(drinking, homosexuality, malpractice, and apathy for their jobs) so we learn what each man's failings are. They run across some strange things, but are having a good time, till the next morning they wake up to find someone has come into the camp at night and taken all of their shoes. The man who planed the trip brought an extra pair and sets off for help, never to be seen again. The others with no shoes and dwindling and an uneasy feeling of being stalked wrap their feet up as best as they can and set off to escape the woods.As the fight their way out the ""person"" leaves clues that show that a doctor did not treat him very well and is now going to take it out on them,or was it one of them that messed him up. The movie is well paced and is very scary. The atmosphere is everything here and it keeps you at the edge of your seat. Hal Holbrook is the only real ""name"" star here and that helps the mood because it makes this seem more documentary than movie. Well worth your time.",5,Strong atmosphere and unseen  dread make this thriller work,1175472000,"04 2, 2007",2007,1372,"['movies', 'first', 'saw', 'C.B.S', 'late', 'night', 'movies', 'Friday', 'nights', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'Deliverance', 'clone', 'little', 'Canadian', 'thriller', 'very', 'well', 'will', 'keep', 'edge', 'seat.6', 'friends', 'Doctors', 'meet', 'yearly', 'retreat', 'together', 'fly', 'deep', 'Canadian', 'woods', 'go', 'fishing', 'hiking', 'guys', 'have', 'problems', 'drinking', 'homosexuality', 'malpractice', 'apathy', 'jobs', 'learn', 'what', 'man', 'failings', 'are', 'run', 'strange', 'things', 'are', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'till', 'next', 'morning', 'wake', 'up', 'find', 'someone', 'come', 'camp', 'night', 'taken', 'shoes', 'man', 'who', 'planed', 'trip', 'brought', 'extra', 'pair', 'sets', 'off', 'help', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'others', 'shoes', 'dwindling', 'uneasy', 'feeling', 'being', 'stalked', 'wrap', 'feet', 'up', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'set', 'off', 'escape', 'woods.As', 'fight', 'way', 'person', 'clues', 'show', 'doctor', 'did', 'not', 'treat', 'very', 'well', 'now', 'going', 'take', 'out', 'was', 'one', 'messed', 'up', 'movie', 'well', 'paced', 'very', 'scary', 'atmosphere', 'everything', 'here', 'edge', 'seat', 'Hal', 'Holbrook', 'only', 'real', 'name', 'star', 'here', 'mood', 'more', 'documentary', 'movie', 'Well', 'time']",Rituals VHS
