824053,A27ZCY8XFNGZPL,B000244GCC,"Happy Camper ""worldpeacemaker""","[3, 4]","This movie is so bad that it is almost campy.  The writing is beyond formulaic-- it's so awful that it's almost funny.  The characters are so flawed that they are almost cartoonish.  The camera work is so ridiculously amateur that it brings to mind the awful products of high school film classes-- in the 70s.  It is so predictable in its plodding that the most interesting thing about it is the outdated hairstyles and fashions embraced by its cast members.  The white-centered stereotyping in this movie is shockingly racist, and the characters are completely unbelievable.  Even Denzel Washington cannot save this film in possibly his worst film role ever.This film is part anti-drunk-driving docusaga, part movie of the week, and part low-budget white nuclear family period piece.  Perhaps the only redeeming virtue it has is the possibility that it will one day become a cult film with people lip-synching the awful lines and camping it up a la Rocky Horror.",1,Quite possibly the WORST movie I have ever seen...,1149292800,"06 3, 2006",2006,963,"['movie', 'so', 'bad', 'almost', 'campy', 'writing', 'formulaic', 'so', 'awful', 'almost', 'funny', 'characters', 'are', 'so', 'flawed', 'are', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'camera', 'work', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'mind', 'awful', 'products', 'high', 'school', 'film', 'classes', '70s', 'so', 'predictable', 'plodding', 'most', 'interesting', 'thing', 'outdated', 'hairstyles', 'fashions', 'embraced', 'cast', 'members', 'white-centered', 'stereotyping', 'movie', 'shockingly', 'racist', 'characters', 'are', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'Even', 'Denzel', 'Washington', 'can', 'not', 'save', 'film', 'possibly', 'worst', 'film', 'role', 'ever.This', 'film', 'part', 'anti-drunk-driving', 'docusaga', 'part', 'movie', 'week', 'part', 'low-budget', 'white', 'nuclear', 'family', 'period', 'piece', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'redeeming', 'virtue', 'possibility', 'will', 'one', 'day', 'become', 'cult', 'film', 'people', 'lip-synching', 'awful', 'lines', 'camping', 'up', 'la', 'Rocky', 'Horror']",N/A

824058,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,B000244GCC,Michael Butts,"[15, 16]","This tv movie is hopelessly preachy and manipulative, but it does bring to the front the tragic issue of drunk driving.  A talented and lively high school senior is killed by a drunk driver; her family tries to deal with the guilt and the father is determined to bring the driver to justice.  The script is cliched, but it does try to look at both sides of the coin and focus on the alcoholic issue as well as vehicular manslaughter.  Denzel Washington makes one of his earlier appearances as the prosecuting attorney but the writers don't give him much to do.  James Farentino and Penny Fuller, along with Don Murray and Millie Perkins, do an okay job in showing the anguish of the victim and the perpetrator.

It's about a family whose teenaged daughter is killed in a car accident by a drunken driver and frustration the family goes through trying to find justice as they encounter beaucratic delays in  bringing case to trial.
