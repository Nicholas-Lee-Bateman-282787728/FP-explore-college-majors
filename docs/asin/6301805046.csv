269887,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,6301805046,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 3]","Preston Sturges' little film, ""Sullivan's Travels"" has been a favorite of mine for a very long time. Since my discover of it through the Criterion collection, I have been impressed with the comic mind of Sturges and his ability to use dark modern issues as a backdrop for something that audiences could laugh at. In ""Sullivan's Travels"" it was the story of a Hollywood director trying to become a hobo to learn about life. While it seems dismal, it provided quite a bit of laughs with an ending that not only solidifies Sturges' ability, but also creates brain candy for hours afterwards. Thus, it was no surprise that when ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" arrived to view - that same excitement for Sturges' overcame me. I was ready for laughter coupled with a sensitive discussion about an ageless topic. Alas, what was viewed, was a cute movie that felt longer than necessary, a comic film with repetitive jokes, and a satire on patriotism that merely scratched the surface to what could have been another ageless film. Instead, ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" felt dated, lacked the push to make it pioneering, and honestly, felt safe. This was a rushed Sturges film, despite the Oscar nomination, and like Eddie Braken's speech at the end, needed to have a stronger voice of truth. Too many missed elements coupled with repeat jokes caused ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" to miss it's mark and remain a ""cute"" movie.The concept is an easy one. You probably have seen it a dozen times before in other films; the son of a war hero is discharged from the army for chronic hay fever, and refuses to go home to face his mother. Enter a band of surly, obvious Army-type figures who influence him into going home looking like a decorated war hero. Hilarity attempts to ensue as the town welcomes him with open arms with such grandiose statements as a parade in his honor, the burning of his mother's mortgage, and the eventual nomination for mayor. As much as Eddie Bracken tries to avoid the applause, he gets further thrust into it. This is a moment where Sturges doesn't quite live up to his comedic hype. There are moments where the scenes are very funny, but Sturges overuses the same jokes again and again that it eventually infects the rest of the film. What should have been witty jokes to move the pace, instead become so repetitive that the nearly hour and half feels like two-plus hours behind the wheel of this vehicle. Braken gives the stationary look of shock throughout, Sgt. Heppelfinger gives the same stern look, and moments of comedy are replaced with awkward settings that should have been funny, but instead failed. Scenes which are reminiscent of this failure are; Braken's arrival home - the entire set up for his grand arrival was funny at first, but as the scene pathetically continued - it just felt claustrophobic and stagnate. This could be said again for the scene where he is about to be nominated for mayor. What should have been funny wasn't - and I think it is because Sturges couldn't control the scenes. Too much in too little time provided minimal laughs.While I claim that our characters were feeling a bit stale, I do argue that they were the strongest element in this film. There were secondary characters that Sturges gave a small string of screen time, and they stole each second. Look out for the priest who burns the mortgage, hilarious; look for the southern Mayor who owns the Chair factory; again - hilarious. I could even laugh again at the Army man who had this fascination with people's mothers. Yet, our major characters couldn't quite reach this level. While the characters were disappointing, the scene structure was obtrusive by Sturges, the actual story was relatively exciting. I loved this concept, the themes of battles not only happening on the front lines, but also at home was impressive. The constant reminders that WAR BONDS were for sale was a small jab at the Government by Sturges, and the universal mind of the soldier who also turned out to be the Braken's guardian angels was delicious. Sturges had a strong mapped film, one just wonders if he was happy with the final product. Again, there were smart elements and there were mediocre moments, all together just making a ""cute"" one-time viewing movie.VIDEO: Released in the Preston Sturges box set, this was a mediocre outing for a man who can confidently create better. Our sub-characters are a great reason to watch this film, while Braken finds his stride within the first two-minutes and continues on that course throughout. The pacing and overall scene development within the town were meant to build laughter, but with me - it just built tension and claustrophobia. Not the elements needed for a Preston Sturges film.VISUAL: The transfer seemed good, with little to no fuzzy elements or missing frames. Nothing elaborate to talk about here - it was your standard release of a smaller Sturges film.SOUND: Matches well with the visuals. Again, the train scenes and music moments worked, when characters were outside you could hear them inside, which provided excellent depth. With a box set, it carried decent film as well as visuals.EXTRAS: Just watching the individual disc, there was nothing except for an option for the language. The special features must have been on another disc - my loss.Overall, Sturges again entertained, but he did not impress. This was a ""cute"" film that just felt too long at certain scenes and at others it felt like missed opportunity. This could have been a stronger satire on patriotism, but jokes fell flat. Sub-characters took control and created a strong town, but the ones that were leading us felt stale from the beginning. I was looking forward to this film due to my admiration towards Sturges, but ""Hail the Conquering Hero"" didn't live up to the hype. ""Sullivan's Travels"" continues to be my favorite as I continue to view more from this infamous director's cannon. I was happy to see that the screenplay was Oscar nominated, but not surprised that it didn't win. Good, not great - ""cute"" - not classic.Grade: ** 1/2 out of *****",3,Buy War Bonds; or Sturges' missed opportunity,1259193600,"11 26, 2009",2009,6076,"['Preston', 'Sturges', 'little', 'film',

However, this film is often underated as one of his many film achievements. In many ways this is the perfect film. Outside of the frenetic pacing executed during most of it, the comic aspects of the script and the excellent performances of the cast there are several very significant elements to this movie that should be acknowledged.  It is a true snapshot of our culture at the time it was made.  The film reflects the values of our society, especially patriotism and devotion to our mothers.  It makes very pointed political statements that are still (unfortunately) true today. Most of all, Hail The Conquering Hero makes us laugh.

It's also one of the best cinematic examples of the ""snowball effect"" where a small action has consequences that get bigger and bigger until it's nearly out of control.Eddie Bracken grew up in a small town in the shadow of his late father who was a great war hero who died in the field of battle the day Eddie was born. Eddie's wanted nothing more in his life than to join the Marines. When he gets old enough he joins, but is then 4-F'd for ""chronic hay fever"". That was over a year ago and ever since he's been working in a shipyard too embarrassed to return home or even tell his mother. One night he's drowning his sorrows in a bar when in walk 6 broke Marines on leave. He buys them a round of drinks and a conversation strikes up. Before you know it the Marines have concocted a plan to get him home to his mother: dress him up as a war hero and escort him home, then after a few days they leave and he returns to civilian life...that's not the best plan ever, but their hearts are bigger than their brains. The next day in the sober sunlight their plan doesn't sound so great when the train arrives in town and not only is Eddie's mother there, but the entire town and not one but four marching bands all playing different songs at once! And that's just the start of the snowball! By the end of the day the town's folk are marching up and down the street with signs and torches loudly singing songs about how they want Eddie to be the new mayor! They also burned the mortgage note on his mother's house and are taking donations to erect a statue of him in the town square. To complicate matters even worse his ex-girlfriend (who still loves him) is now engaged to the current mayor's son. From beginning to end the entire thing is just a frenzy of people running around like mad, talking and shouting over each other. It's hilarious and even at moments very touching.All of the films Preston Sturges wrote and directed between 1941 and 1944 were masterpieces. Most of the credit goes to Sturges and his amazing scripts, but we can't forget Sturges regular actors who appeared in all of his films during this period. Of his 38 regulars 22 starred in this film.I can't recommend this movie enough. I've seen it dozens of times and one of the things I like to do now to keep it fresh is pick out one actor and just watch them the entire time whether they're speaking or not. I think the best to watch is Ella Raines, mainly because she's beautiful, but also because her reactions all of the crazy stuff stuff going on around her is priceless. One question I do have that I doubt will ever get answered is: during Mayor Noble's speech at the train station if you watch Ella's character she's holding a bouquet of ""del-fuminimums"". During the madness she turns a few times and each time the tip of the flowers rubs Franklin Pandborn's face. Was that planned or did it just happen? Either way Franklin plays it smooth and his facial expressions are amusing.Every time Eddie sneezes I can't help but think of ""Spots!

I see this as probably the second movie of a double feature at the local Bijou, (who remembers those days?).Eddie Bracken plays the little guy with a big name (Woodrow LaFayette Pershing Trusmith) &amp; a bigger legacy, that of his father who died a Marine hero. in WWI. Of course he joins the Marines but promptly washes out with severe hayfever. Too embarassed to return home he dumps his girlfriend &amp; pretends to be overseas. He's drinking at a bar &amp; runs into a group of real Marines just back from Guadalcanal. Despite his protests, they accompany him back home. He is mistakenly greeted as a hero home from war. Bedlam &amp; confusion ensue as befits the  screwball comedies of the day. It all has a  happy ending,  (required in those days). This movies satirizes the cult of celebrity &amp; the effects of mob mentality. Woody, his girlfriend  Libby played by Ella Rainer &amp; the townsfolks are all likeable.

269896,A2NJO6YE954DBH,6301805046,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[10, 10]","Preston Sturges' 1944 farce &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; tells the story of Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith (Eddie Bracken), who is discharged from the Marines because he has Hay Fever.  Ashamed to go home, Woodrow meets up with Sergeant Heppelfinger (William Demarest), a decorated Marine hero from Guadalcanal, who decide the boy should return home as a hero.  Woodrow returns home where the entire town shows up to greet the &quot;conquering hero&quot; and end up nominating him for Mayor.  Of course, Woodrow becomes more and more uncomfortable with the way things are going and feelings compelled to do the right thing.On the one hand, because this is Preston Sturges we realize this film is a rather pointed examination of the cult of hero worship that can spring up around mere mortals.  Then again, you can simply take this as a variation on the old mistaken identity routine in an above-average screwball comedy.  Bracken's performance is at the heart of either interpretation and it is impossible not to feel sorry for the guy, who never really wanted to go along with this ploy in the first place.  Sturges employed a host of his regulars, such as Raymond Walburn and Franklin Pangborn, but newcomer Ella Raines as Libby, the girl Woodrow left behind, really shines through (think Cathy O'Donnell in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;).  This is not one of the films that immediately comes to mind when you think of Preston Sturges, but he rarely disappoints you with any of his films.",5,Preston Sturges' screwball comedy about hero worship,991872000,"06 7, 2001",2001,1514,"['Preston', 'Sturges', '1944', 'farce', 'quot', 'Hail', 'Conquering', 'Hero', 'quot', 'story', 'Woodrow', 'Lafayette', 'Pershing', 'Truesmith', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'who', 'discharged', 'Marines', 'Hay', 'Fever', 'Ashamed', 'go', 'home', 'Woodrow', 'up', 'Sergeant', 'Heppelfinger', 'William', 'Demarest', 'decorated', 'Marine', 'hero', 'Guadalcanal', 'who', 'decide', 'boy', 'should', 'return', 'home', 'hero', 'Woodrow', 'home', 'where', 'entire', 'town', 'up', 'greet', 'quot', 'conquering', 'hero', 'quot', 'end', 'up', 'nominating', 'Mayor', 'course', 'Woodrow', 'more', 'more', 'uncomfortable', 'way', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'feelings', 'compelled', 'do', 'right', 'one', 'hand', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'realize', 'film', 'rather', 'pointed', 'examination', 'cult', 'hero', 'worship', 'can', 'spring', 'up', 'around', 'mere', 'mortals', 'Then', 'again', 'can', 'simply', 'take', 'variation', 'old', 'mistaken', 'identity', 'routine', 'above-average', 'screwball', 'comedy', 'Bracken', 'performance', 'heart', 'interpretation', 'impossible', 'not', 'feel', 'sorry', 'guy', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'wanted', 'go', 'along', 'ploy', 'first', 'place', 'employed', 'host', 'regulars', 'such', 'Raymond', 'Walburn', 'Franklin', 'Pangborn', 'newcomer', 'Ella', 'Raines', 'Libby', 'girl', 'Woodrow', 'left', 'behind', 'really', 'think', 'Cathy', ""O'Donnell"", 'quot', 'Best', 'Years', 'Lives', 'quot', 'not', 'one', 'films', 'immediately', 'mind', 'when', 'think', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'rarely', 'films']",N/A

269900,A16QODENBJVUI1,6301805046,Robert Moore,"[7, 8]","Between 1940 and 1944, Preston Sturges was on a role.  He wrote and directed seven absolutely stellar comedies before he lost the magical touch that had made his one of the great comedy screenwriters of the 1930s and directors of the early 1940s.  This was the last of that stellar run.The premise is simple.  Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith, magnificently portrayed by Eddie Bracken, is discharged from the marines because of hay fever, but is too ashamed to return home.  Instead, he fakes a military career, having people mail home letters from abroad to make his friends and family and girlfriend all believe he is in combat.  When a group of marines hear about his situation, they compassionately decide to return him to his hometown as a war hero.  The bulk of the film deals with the misunderstandings that arise from this pretence.HAIL THE CONQUERING HERO has all the marks of Sturges's best work:  lightening paced dialog, a huge cast of talented character actors (most familiar from other Sturges films), and multiple layers of action in scene after scene.  The ensemble cast truly excels in this film.  No one, however, stands out more than William Demarest, who did almost all his greatest work in Sturges films.For some reason, this film does not seem to be shown as often as most of Sturges best films, and even some lesser films get shown more frequently.  But this is absolutely first rate Sturges, and anyone enjoying THE LADY EVE or SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS or THE PALM BEACH STORY will find just as much to love in this one.",5,Perhaps Sturges most neglected masterpiece,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,1542,"['Between', '1940', '1944', 'Preston', 'Sturges', 'was', 'role', 'wrote', 'directed', 'seven', 'absolutely', 'stellar', 'comedies', 'lost', 'magical', 'touch', 'had', 'made', 'one', 'great', 'comedy', 'screenwriters', '1930s', 'directors', 'early', '1940s', 'was', 'last', 'stellar', 'run.The', 'premise', 'simple', 'Woodrow', 'Lafayette', 'Pershing', 'Truesmith', 'magnificently', 'portrayed', 'Eddie', 'Bracken', 'discharged', 'marines', 'hay', 'fever', 'too', 'ashamed', 'return', 'home', 'Instead', 'military', 'career', 'having', 'people', 'mail', 'home', 'letters', 'abroad', 'make', 'friends', 'family', 'girlfriend', 'believe', 'combat', 'When', 'group', 'marines', 'hear', 'situation', 'compassionately', 'decide', 'return', 'hometown', 'war', 'hero', 'bulk', 'film', 'deals', 'misunderstandings', 'arise', 'THE', 'CONQUERING', 'HERO', 'marks', 'Sturges', 'best', 'work', 'lightening', 'paced', 'dialog', 'huge', 'cast', 'talented', 'character', 'actors', 'most', 'familiar', 'other', 'Sturges', 'films', 'multiple', 'layers', 'action', 'scene', 'scene', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'truly', 'excels', 'film', 'one', 'however', 'out', 'more', 'William', 'Demarest', 'who', 'did', 'almost', 'greatest', 'work', 'Sturges', 'films.For', 'reason', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'be', 'shown', 'as', 'often', 'most', 'Sturges', 'best', 'films', 'even', 'lesser', 'films', 'get', 'shown', 'more', 'frequently', 'absolutely', 'first', 'rate', 'Sturges', 'anyone', 'enjoying', 'THE', 'LADY', 'EVE', 'SULLIVAN', 'TRAVELS', 'THE', 'PALM', 'BEACH', 'STORY', 'will', 'find', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'one']",N/A
