I loved Bruce Timm's vision in ""Batman: The Animated Series""; although the original episodes borrowed their look heavily from Tim Burton's movie, the characters were well-developed (consider the time spent introducing Two-Face or Mr. Freeze), and the series evolved over time to create an excellent atmosphere with great story-telling.Unfortunately, none of this is present in ""The Batman"". This series is mediocre in many regards - Bruce Wayne comes across as a weak, forgettable character, and the villains are nothing to write home about (although I did like the fact that they re-designed many of them, they just don't seem to work in any regard). The dialogue is inane as well.Not a strong offering...",2,"Not so good, unfortunately",1171756800,"02 18, 2007",2007,753,"['was', 'fan', 'campy', 'Batman', '60', 'loved', 'Bruce', 'Timm', 'vision', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'original', 'episodes', 'borrowed', 'look', 'heavily', 'Tim', 'Burton', 'movie', 'characters', 'were', 'well-developed', 'consider', 'time', 'spent', 'introducing', 'Two-Face', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'series', 'evolved', 'time', 'create', 'excellent', 'atmosphere', 'great', 'story-telling.Unfortunately', 'none', 'present', 'Batman', 'series', 'mediocre', 'many', 'regards', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'across', 'weak', 'forgettable', 'character', 'villains', 'are', 'nothing', 'write', 'home', 'did', 'fact', 're-designed', 'many', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'work', 'regard', 'dialogue', 'inane', 'well.Not', 'strong', 'offering']","The Batman: Training for Power Season 1, Vol. 1"

The new show features very odd character designs. Especially the villians. The Joker for instance, one of my favorite comic bad guys has been reduced to a jamican Sideshow Bob rip-off. The show is lame compared to the original comics and the previous animation series. If Bruce Timm was dead, he would be spinning in his grave. The previous animated series lasted nearly ten years, while this ""thing"" will probably be gone after a couple of months.

This may not be the Batman we grew up with, it is a Batman mythology that largely works within its own conceptual framework. Mind you, there are few life lessons to be gleaned here and the moralistic leanings are occasionally suspect, but overly-simplified good versus overly-slimplified does get its due. And that never gets old, right? Anyhow...Many of the villians we originally grew to love as shaded multifaceted characters get short shrift in The Batman, but the Bruce/Alfred relationship has some nice depth to it. Moreover, the re-working of the villians - while more successful in some cases than others - is a pleasant excuse to showcase some of the very best action sequences we have seen in this incarnation of Batman or any other. So, while I share some of the other reviewers mixed feelings over this latest incarnation, I also can't help but feel like this is an okay way to blow twenty minutes and thirty seconds.Now that I think about it, that's as good a reason to rent or buy these DVDs as any other, parents.

893709,A3IVAJOW2BP5DT,B0007XG266,Anonymous,"[0, 0]","First and foremost, let's just get this out of the way: It's okay to have loved ""Batman: The Animated Series"" and yet still enjoy ""The Batman"".  Batman has many different incarnations/interpretations, and there are pros and cons to all of them (sans ""Batman & Robin"" - I think all Batman fans can agree that was a giant, steaming pile of garbage!).As far as THIS series goes...I just watched the first season, and it's actually not bad.  The animation style takes a while to get used to but it's actually quite sharp.  The voice acting is pretty good and even great with some characters.  And if nothing else, the show definitely gets the CHARACTERIZATIONS correct, especially with regards to Bruce, Alfred, and Catwoman.Now the cons...yes, this show is not as good as TAS, which isn't its fault per se because TAS was just extremely awesome.  The design of the Batmobile is a little strange, also - it looks like an electric shaver with a blue light.  And while the show stays true to the spirit of every character it presents in the first season, it struggles to find a balance between kid-friendly elements versus more mature elements.  One episode that immediately springs to mind (and **SPOILER ALERT** for those interested in such things) is where The Joker has a ray gun that turns people into giant playing cards (think Han Solo in carbonite).  The characters themselves aren't really funny but the plots had them doing campy things, and the results are an uneven balance between TAS and some of the more campier versions of Batman.And while we're on the subject...two out of the three episodes to feature The Joker may have been the weakest episodes of the season, which is unsual because The Joker is such a great character and usually he's clutch.  Maybe it was just difficult for me to get passed some of the weird things they had him do (ray gun, Joker Putty), as well as the weird design of the character?Not sure how the remaining 4 seasons will play out, but this was a decent start, IMO.",3,Solid (if Uneven) First Season,1359158400,"01 26, 2013",2013,2004,"['First', 'foremost', 'let', 'just', 'get', 'out', 'way', 'okay', 'have', 'loved', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'yet', 'still', 'enjoy', 'Batman', 'Batman', 'many', 'different', 'incarnations/interpretations', 'are', 'pros', 'cons', 'Batman', 'Robin', 'think', 'Batman', 'fans', 'can', 'agree', 'was', 'giant', 'steaming', 'pile', 'garbage', '.As', 'far', 'THIS', 'series', 'just', 'watched', 'first', 'season', 'actually', 'not', 'bad', 'animation', 'style', 'while', 'get', 'used', 'actually', 'quite', 'sharp', 'voice', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'even', 'great', 'characters', 'nothing', 'else', 'show', 'definitely', 'CHARACTERIZATIONS', 'correct', 'especially', 'regards', 'Bruce', 'Alfred', 'Catwoman.Now', 'cons', 'yes', 'show', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'TAS', ""n't"", 'fault', 'se', 'TAS', 'was', 'just', 'extremely', 'awesome', 'design', 'Batmobile', 'little', 'strange', 'also', 'electric', 'shaver', 'blue', 'light', 'show', 'true', 'spirit', 'character', 'first', 'season', 'find', 'balance', 'kid-friendly', 'elements', 'more', 'mature', 'elements', 'One', 'episode', 'immediately', 'mind', '**SPOILER', 'ALERT**', 'interested', 'such', 'things', 'where', 'Joker', 'ray', 'gun', 'people', 'giant', 'playing', 'cards', 'think', 'Han', 'Solo', 'carbonite', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'funny', 'plots', 'had', 'doing', 'campy', 'things', 'results', 'are', 'uneven', 'balance', 'TAS', 'more', 'campier', 'versions', 'Batman.And', ""'re"", 'subject', 'two', 'three', 'episodes', 'feature', 'Joker', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'weakest', 'episodes', 'season', 'unsual', 'Joker', 'such', 'great', 'character', 'usually', 'clutch', 'Maybe', 'was', 'just', 'difficult', 'get', 'passed', 'weird', 'things', 'had', 'do', 'ray', 'gun', 'Joker', 'Putty', 'as', 'well', 'weird', 'design', 'character', 'Not', 'sure', 'how', 'remaining', '4', 'seasons', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'was', 'decent', 'start', 'IMO']","The Batman: Training for Power Season 1, Vol. 1"

It  is  better than most of  recent cartoons  that is out there...especially the  Teen Titans, which rips off  Japanimation styles and does not  work for me as a serious superhero cartoon (yes I know many will not like that statement!)And . Yes, I am a fan of Batman the Animated series.  It broke new ground in animation and the Batman mythos.  its better that the 1960 cartoon  Filmation did (By the way, this stuff  has never hit DVD yet) and the 80's cartoon series with Robin (which was run with Lone Ranger, Tarzan or Zorro on CBS ).  This animated  show acts like neither B.A.S. ,  the 1960's Batman or even the early 80's cartoon  remake and I am so glad it isn't . This  is a young Bruce Wayne learning to be Batman, not the well seasoned Bats from the BAS . This is a  cartoon version of the film Batman Begins, it  works in some ways and fails in others. This Batman may have the cave, the tools and the toys-but he is very green and still learning how to put it all togetherI like the story lines, Most of them  are fresh,innovated,  well thought out and  well acted. The modern day non art demo of this cartoon works as well. The voice talent for this Batman is first rate, better than the formally  mentioned Teen Titans and less HOLLYWOOD as BAS was. Now the BAD news,  the animation of most of  the Batman's arch-villains seem off in my opinion... too weird and strange from the classic Batman Mythos-the Comics of old.  Such  Characters  like Joker, Penguin, and Clayface to name three does not seem right to me. Also, some of  the villain's origins are changed... some for better and some for the worst. However, Thank you there is NO Robin-one of the weakest points in BAS .This  Dark Knight seems to be a throw back the the 1930's classic comic version-judged and hunted as a fugitive by the police...

At 26, he's still a little rough around the edges but, definitely, honing his craft as a crimefighter. He goes up against the likes of The Joker, Penguin, Catwoman, Firefly, Man-Bat(one of my all-time favorite Batman villans), The Ventriloquist(the other all-time favorite), Clayface, Rupert Thorne, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and Cluemaster. Vocal talent was provided by: Rino Romano, Adam West(TV's live-action Batman of the 60s), Alastair Duncan, Victor Brandt, Kevin Michael Richardson, Gina Gershon, Clancy Brown,  Steve Harris, Jason Marsden, Dan Castellaneta, Peter MacNicol, Glenn Shadix, Joaquim de Almeida and Mr. Hellboy,himself, Ron Perlman. In my opinion, the first season shows a more lighter humorous side of Batman but the episodes are great,nonetheless. My favorite episodes were, of course, the ones featuring Man-Bat & The Ventriloquist. With The Batman, you'll notice a huge difference in artistic styles for the show as opposed to Batman: The Animated Series. It also has a more adult tone to it than anything that has previously came before it. I really enjoyed season one and will continue to add the show to my collection.If you're a Batman fan, give this show a chance. It is actually pretty good.

893715,A3JEL8075DWY8,B0007XG266,"Brent G. Long ""brent6980""","[2, 2]","Let's clear the air immediately, I do subscribe to the cliche that this series is not as good as Batman, The Animated Series (B:TAS)(1992-1995), or its spin-offs (aka the ""Timmiverse""). But I thoroughly enjoy this series, also. I actually rented this first season before purchasing all five seasons and its one DTV movie (hence the 1/6 in this review title), so that should tell you how I feel overall.**Potential Spoilers Below** I don't seek to ruin large revelations, but for the sake of telling what I like and what I don't, there may be some potential spoilers, depending on how you view that term.I had tried watching The Batman a time or two during its first run, but at that time I thought that Kevin Conroy was Batman, Mark Hamill was The Joker, etc., and there was no one else for those parts. After really liking the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series, which featured at times, other actors portraying the Bat, and after reading about it some before giving it another chance, there were some things that piqued my interest enough to give it a shot. Specifically, the re-imagining of the villains.What I liked after actually watching Season One, is the fact that you're seeing Batman in his third year; he's not going to just run in and always have an easy time disabling the henchmen. In this season, he's also not quite the detective that is, to me, a large part of who Batman is. There seems to be a large dependence on gadgets; I've read where that is a sore point for some. I couldn't help but think it's James Bond meets Batman, which was a different but not a bad take on the character. As far as villains go, Mr. Freeze is less the tragic figure B:TAS had (re)envisioned him to be, and more the straight criminal. Also Firefly didn't have much face time in the ""Timmiverse"" and while he is only featured once during this season, he made further appearances in following seasons.

I remember thinking ""wow, looks like a campy version of the 90's show"". Well, I hate to admit when I'm wrong but here it goes... I was wrong. I've always been a batman fan. As a kid I would watch the 90's show every chance I got. Like every batman fan, I was so excited when ""The Dark Knight"" came out. After I saw it twice in the theater, I pulled out my old graphic novels and re-read them. I also pulled out my 90's animated series dvds and re-watched those. I read some reviews of ""The Batman"" and after seeing the first season at the store for 12.99, I decided why not. While there are some flaws with this series, at least in the first season, there are some great pros. I was one of the ones that HATED the way the new joker looked, but to be honest, this joker seems more like the joker from the comics then the other one from the old series ever did. He seems crazier, like he doesn't care to get caught or not, and after a while his looks grows on you. My only complaint is that it gets a little redundant after a while. Some of the episodes almost seem similar, just with a different bad guy. We have to remember though that this is the first season and lets be honest, the first season of the original batman series had its flaws.These are My top five favorite episodes of this season.1. The Bat in the Belfry (Classic Joker)2. The Rubberface of Comedy/ The Clayface of Tragedy3. Traction4. The Big Heat5. The Man Who Would be BatSo, there you have it. I would highly recommend this. I am in the process of watching the second season and once it is done, I will make sure to write a review for it also.oh yeah, another problem I had with it is Mr. Freeze. They went with the classic story of his character instead of the poetic one made in The Animated Series, and it really doesnt work.

893721,A239PPUVV8O0U0,B0007XG266,D. A. Reed,"[5, 5]","The first season of The Batman is weak but not as weak as some of the seasons to come. Sure season 1 has problems but it wasn't that bad of a season. Let's jump in!The animation (and this goes for subsequent seasons as well) always looked great in this series. The landscape, the fight sequences and character design. Though done in an anime-esque style (reminding me a lot of Jackie Chan Adventures), the characters still had a resemblance (vague for some characters however; ex. Cluemaster) when I compare it to the actual anime seen in Gotham Knight. And while its not the ""classic"" Batman look that the nineties animated series had, I grew to like the designs, except for one and that was Catwoman. Her costume didn't even resemble a cat, well the mask part anyway. She looked like a mouse with overgrown ears! Batman/Bruce Wayne and Alfred have almost no change done to them whatsoever when compared to other designs, though Batman's cape is a little longer but it does look good when he's jumping about the buildings. The Joker design startled me at first and I was a little off put by his wardrobe in the first episode but by the time he reappeared again, he was back in his traditional (for this show anyway) outfit (though the straightjacket look would reappear one more time in season 2) and I was happy. Though for the life of me I'll never understand why they didn't give him any shoes. Penguin's back to his Danny DeVito look and it kind of works for this series over its predecessor. Though he looked deformed in B:TAS, he still acted and dressed like a refined gentleman of crime. The only off putting thing about Penguin is the oversized hat and his coattails dragging on the ground. Firefly is another villain that got a decent upgrade; from a man in a metal suit and helmet to a guy in a flying bug suit (though you'd think that the giant light on the costume would slow him down and the ""flying"" effect did get annoying) Another negative thing to point out is that this version of Gotham is the least populated. I've never seen a city so empty before in my life (except London in The Avengers but they were striving for a ""fantasy"" approach to that series).Voice acting however was not the strong point for this season though Rino Romano and Kevin Michael Richardson are good as Batman and Joker, respectively. Steve Harris and Ming-Na do great jobs as Det. Ethan Bennett and Ellen Yin but special praise for Harris during the two-part season finale. He really brings out Ethan's turmoil as he goes from being tortured at the hands of Joker to having his morals confused after being turned into Clayface. Tom Kenny's Penguin is a little more obnoxious than Paul Williams' interpretation but it does reflect the design of the character. Kenny's Penguin, while obnoxious, is far more vicious than Williams and he does bring back the ""Penguin laugh"" that Burgess Meredith had done back in the sixties. Clancy Brown's Mr. Freeze, while not as sympathetic, is still pretty menacing but the ice puns wear thin (though that's more of the writer's fault for watching too much Batman & Robin). James Marsden's Firefly is actually sounds pretty tough to the bland rendition we got before. The only voice I didn't like was Gina Gershon as Catwoman. It sounds like she's trying to be mysterious and sexy but it sounds like she's imitating Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy. And special mention to Adam West as Mayor Grange, who would end up being an underused character until he is replaced in season 5.The writing was something that would improve as time went on. This series starts with Batman in his third year of crime-fighting and he's eliminated most, if not all, of Gotham's organized crime. That is until some costumed clown and a host of other costumed criminals showed up. While the first season mainly set up Batman's encounters with his infamous Rogues Gallery, those would be the strong points. Well every time except Q&A;, which is probably the worst episode of the series (though that's probably debatable). Every time he's with Alfred and they talk about ""The Batman"", they refer to him in the third person as if he's a different character. Exchanges such as;Bruce: I'm thinking about letting Ethan into the fold.Alfred: You mean someone other than me would know The Batman's identity?Um, he's standing right in front of you, why didn't you just say ""your identity"". Another irking thing that would pop up in episodes would be Alfred irking Bruce to lead a normal life such as signing him up on a dating website or implying that he needs to be a ""full time Bruce Wayne"". He's been with him all of his life and knows he's committed to his cause so why try and change his mind. He even admits in one episode that even if Bruce did listen to him, Alfred would regret it. I know in other versions, Alfred has implied that it would be good for Bruce to let go and live a normal life but he's never been a nag about it. There were only four episodes, to me anyway, that were standout this season. First is ""The Big Heat"", which features Batman's first encounter with Firefly. The subplot deals with Bruce trying to convince the city council members that he's just as capable of running the children's hospital as his father had been. While he does achieve it in the end, when he fails, you can see the disappointment in his face, thinking that he's let down the memory of his father. Second is ""The Big Dummy"" and, like ""Heat"", features the Caped Crusader fighting the Ventriloquist and Scarface. While it ends up being a ""villain with a gimmick"" episode, I like how it touches upon Ventriloquist's split personality which would unfortunately be touched upon one other time in season 3. Lastly is the two-part season finale ""The Rubberface of Comedy""/""The Clayface of Tragedy"", wherein it starts out as a villain-gimmick episode, it turns into how Ethan Bennett falls from grace and turns into the villainous Clayface. A real tragic character as all season you see him debating about Batman and whether he thinks this vigilante does any good in the city only to become one of the very people he fights. This would be a semi-arc that would continue for a couple of seasons.All in all, season 1 was weak but, like Justice League, it did improve over time.",4,Not The Original Animated Series But I Like

It's a fresh start for Gotham's vigilante, meaning he has no relationship with the police, is still working on his crime fighting skills, and making his name known on the streets.  I love this series and have seen it from beginning to finish.  It's fairly dark but not so dark it's not kid friendly.  The character's have some great depth and back stories.  It even goes into the back stories of several of the villains which is nice for those who aren't as familiar with the comic books.

This incarnation features many more gadgets (designed for selling toys, no doubt!) and less detective work.  Character development is limited as well, except in the case of the detectives.  This is a pre-commisioner Gordon Gotham city, and there's no Robin either.  While this works, the aim of the show is clearly a little younger demographic than Batman: The Animated Series (or maybe it's the same, we've just lowered our standards..or raised them...).Now we have to explain.If it's for kids, and it is, it's surprising that Robin doesn't show up until much later in the series.  This means that Batman has to be more kid-friendly, thus there is a lot more action than the dark and gritty Batman of the 90's series.As far as standards - the story lines suffer in depth.  This also a Gotham mostly without guns.  In fact, the police force carries around these laser-gun looking things instead of the old revolvers that were okay in the 90's for animated cops to carry around.Batman has new gadgets, and the villains are sillier in their &#34;crimes&#34; and even worse in their puns.Still, it's a Batman for a new set of kids and he doesn't disappoint.",4,The BATMAN is more kid friendly than it's predecessor,1397865600,"04 19, 2014",2014,1247,"['series', '34', 'Batman', '34', 'still', 'Batman', 'A', 'younger', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'fighting', 'crime', 'incarnation', 'many', 'more', 'gadgets', 'designed', 'selling', 'toys', 'doubt', 'less', 'detective', 'work', 'Character', 'development', 'limited', 'as', 'well', 'case', 'detectives', 'pre-commisioner', 'Gordon', 'Gotham', 'city', 'Robin', 'either', 'aim', 'show', 'clearly', 'little', 'younger', 'demographic', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', 'maybe', 'same', ""'ve"", 'just', 'lowered', 'standards..or', 'raised', '.Now', 'have', 'explain.If', 'kids', 'surprising', 'Robin', ""n't"", 'show', 'up', 'much', 'later', 'series', 'Batman', 'be', 'more', 'kid-friendly', 'thus', 'lot', 'more', 'action', 'dark', 'gritty', 'Batman', '90', 'series.As', 'far', 'standards', 'story', 'lines', 'suffer', 'depth', 'also', 'Gotham', 'mostly', 'guns', 'fact', 'police', 'force', 'laser-gun', 'looking', 'things', 'instead', 'old', 'revolvers', 'were', 'okay', '90', 'animated', 'cops', 'carry', 'around.Batman', 'new', 'gadgets', 'villains', 'are', 'sillier', '34', 'crimes', '34', 'even', 'worse', 'puns.Still', 'Batman', 'new', 'set', 'kids', ""n't"", 'disappoint']","The Batman: Training for Power Season 1, Vol. 1"

All in all, I don't consider this on par with some of the better seasons of ""Batman: The Animated Series"", but I do enjoy it very much.  It has a very modern feel to it and the gadgets and technology The Batman has access to in this series, far exceeds that of any of the others.

It seems at this time, the 'true' villains show their faces, such as appearances by Joker, Penguin, Mr. Freeze, and even the sassy Catwoman. This show also introduces police detectives: Ellen Yin and Ethan Bennet -- Bruce's best friend!My Opinion: I have to admit, I do like the first season, but I love the second season better. This season is more along the lines of introducing the villains and what they may do for the show (or so to speak). The stories may not be as great as Batman: The Animated Series, and such others, but this show isn't as bad as people say it to be. I think the animation in this is stunning!, but I guess it makes up for some of the lame story lines in SOME of the episodes. It also gets on my nerves when the police seem to never use their 'Star Wars blasters' to get the criminals. It's understandable I guess when you think about it; this show IS more diverted towards children around 10 years or so.My Opinion of Great Episodes: I'm a big fan of this new animated Joker, and I basically watch his episodes over and over again (yeah, I know: pathetic). That dosen't mean there aren't still great episodes, such as the list that follows:1. ""The Bat in the Belfry"" (the pilot episode, and also introduces the monkey-movements of Joker...at least for this episode)2. ""Traction"" (pratically the only episode you see Bane in. Batman must find more strength if he ever wants to defeat this foe!)3. ""Big Dummy"" (Batman is perplexed when he meets ventriloquist Arnold Wesker...along with his demanding dummy, Scarface)4. ""Topsy Turvy"" (is there two Joker's running around, or is this all some kind of prank?)5. ""Bird of Prey"" (jealousy of Bruce Wayne takes its toll on Penguin when he decides to rob the guy...while the media watch Bruce's every step!)6. ""The Rubber Face of Comedy"" (Joker has a new 'chemical' up his sleeve, and decides to kidnap a certain officer and use it on him!)7. ""The Clay Face of Tragedy"" (when Ethan becomes Clay Face, he takes his rage on the gruffly police cheif!)Overall: This show may not be for everyone, but you Batman fans shouldn't judge it unless you've actually watched it.

893740,A3CFDAC6H47N1J,B0007XG266,M. Siddiqi,"[11, 14]","Characters like Batman and Superman cast long shadows. The aura of these characters is that they have no reality to bind them to. They are borne of our imagination and own psyche and that is why they can be resurrected in the image of different eras in time. They are symbols of our own internal selves, that is why you can draw them up again and again and they never die. Superman represents that part of the human psyche that is beyond destruction and rises uncorrupted no matter what you throw at it, no matter what you do to it. Batman is the exact opposite. Batman is a mortal, tormented soul on the edge that lurks in the shadows, and takes on evil with a dark vengeance. Superman is the real person and Clark Kent is the mask, but Bruce Wayne is the real person and The Batman is the mask. In a sordid sort of way, Superman is like Dr. Jekyll and Batman is Mr. Hyde - two sides of the same coin.And once again, Batman has been resurrected in this retro series. ""The Batman"" is constructed in a time before the one depicted in the classical ""Batman: The Animated Series"", probably a decade or so earlier. Bruce Wayne is in his mid-20's and Batman is not yet the legend depicted in The Animated Series. He has just appeared on the scene of Gotham and started his shadowy crime-fighting career where the law sees him no differently than the characters he is at odds with.Some of the characterizations are good and you can feel how they gel in given the above backdrop. Sobriety and age doesn't seem to have caught up with an also-younger Alfred Pennyworth, Bruce Wayne's confidant and surrogate-guardian. He is presented as being slightly perkier and more wisecracking compared to the depiction in The Animated Series.Batman is defined by the villains he faces and in season one, his old nemeses The Joker, Penguin, Bane, Dr. Langstrom, Mr. Freeze, Firefly, Scarface, and Clayface are all back. The Joker lives up to his maniacal aura and Kevin Michael Richardson's voice doesn't deviate far from the signature personality that Mark Hamill gave Joker in TAS; KMR's voice has more timber and gruffness at times compared to the diabolical cackle of Mark Hamill. I thought the look of the Joker was a bit too ""jack in the box"" making him look grotesque at first glance. Oswald Cobblepot a.k.a. the Penguin is cast more in the image of Tim Burton's rendition from the movie. Again, Tom Kenny does a good job giving more deviousness to Penguin's character. Bane, Dr. Langstrom a.k.a. The Man-Bat, and Scarface don't deviate much either apart from their color schemes compared to TAS. Firefly looks better. I liked the Firefly character line better in the TAS but this series has done a decent makeup job on him especially with the buzzing audio f/x.Mr. Freeze is a heresy. The whole Mr. Freeze character in TAS was a masterpiece between his personality as defined by his accident and his quest to save his wife, and Michael Ansara's ""poker-faced"", emotionless, superb voice characterization completing things full circle. This series has turned Victor Fries into a common thug in a walking icebox for a suit.However, the delight of season one, as everyone has commented below is the whole Clayface arc. This series has done for Clayface what TAS did for the Harvey Dent/Two-Face and Victor Fries/Mr. Freeze story arcs, and the story and production teams get kudos for the way they draw out the entire Clayface story arc in the fantastic two-episode season finale.As for the presentation, The Batman is slightly more colorful and more detailed than TAS. Part of the power of TAS was that it was drawn entirely on black and created its ambiance by capitalizing masterfully on abstraction and lack of details in animation, while sticking with a more restrictive color palette comprised of dark, crimson, shadowy colors. This series has more details in the artwork and a wider use of colors. It takes a few episodes to get used to it if you are a die-hard TAS fan. The TAS also mixed in some retro elements such as the cars and buildings at times very aesthetically. The batmobile looks more commercial in this series, more high-tech, but more like Bruce Wayne decided to have Toyota, Honda or Audi build it for him. :-) Arkham Asylum looks better in this series in my opinion; the addition of detail such as the brickwork walls and pipe-grill doors, have done it good. It looks more creepy than cozy and you can see it as this really creepy holding place for mentally insane criminals. It augments the dark aura of the Batman character itself.Finally the voice characterization of Rino Romano fits given the background. Kevin Conroy's voice was perfect for a mid-30s Batman, who had been ""at it"" for a decade or more -- an established legend in Gotham, more sure of himself, used to facing whackjobs and weirdos. Kevin Conroy gave Batman ""the coming of age"" personality. Rino Romano gives personality to a younger Batman, more unsure of himself, just out of adolesence and still coming to grips with what he is becoming. Rino Romano's voice characterization lacks the command and force of Kevin Conroy...which is correct.All in all, it's a new Batman for a new era and if you like the Batman character, don't miss it.",4,Casting a long shadow,1164240000,"11 23, 2006",2006,5213,"['Characters', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'cast', 'long', 'shadows', 'aura', 'characters', 'have', 'reality', 'bind', 'are', 'borne',

The Batman is aimed at younger viewers and portrays a green and young Bruce Wayne in his early years of being the Dark Knight.  However, the show doesn't work right, and the characters are flat, particularly the villains.  One of Batman's greatest strengths is his rouges gallery, and in this series, they are relegated to run of the mill crooks.  The Joker, the Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Bane, and the Man-Bat become two dimensional thugs that are shells of their former selves, while Batman himself has become an adrenaline junkie.  The animation style is stiff and more manga-esque than one could imagine, and it's a look that doesn't work.  What saves season one of the Batman is the finale, which creates an unbelievaly tragic turn on the origin of Clayface, which suggests that maybe there is some hope for the show.  All in all, if you're a long time Bat-fan, stick with the classic Batman: the Animated Series, and check this out only for the finale.

893744,AHF97M45JFCB,B0007XG266,ONENEO,"[3, 4]","Well after having just finished this Season 1 double disc set, I have to admit that while many of the criticisms have been a bit harsh, there is some truth to them as well.I know comparisons to the generally impeccable Batman: The Animated Series (TAS) have been done to death, even this show's creators admit to their own fondness and inspiration from TAS when developing The Batman.Honestly, the animation quality of The Batman is better than I remembered from catching occasional episodes on Saturday mornings.  The artistic style aims for a bit of Japanese-anime with odd (but interesting) color use.  Need examples? Prepare for a fair share of green skies, crimson skies, black and white interiors etc. Fans of TAS will likely need a moment to adjust to the brighter backgrounds and more close-up angle fight scenes but it is nothing that an episode or two doesn't take care of.The stories are pretty well told especially considering that the intended age group of this series is far lower than the more-adult oriented TAS.  The problem is that the villains aren't near as well developed as they could (or should) have been.We meet the Joker with little to no explanation of his coming to be and even less regard to his new look: Green dread locks, glowing red eyes, and an apparent dislike for shoes.Things bottom out with Mister Freeze, who's back story is completely downgraded to a common diamond thief who has a car accident as a result of Batman's pursuit.  Fair enough until you witness TAS' take on the same villain in which your heart actually goes out to the man as he's misunderstood by everyone (except Batman).On the other hand The Ventriloquist was done with a surprising deal of class and accuracy as is Firefly, proving that there is hope for this series if the writers wish to dig a little deeper.  I suppose the biggest consolation comes in the form of the reviews I've read on the Second Season where reviewers state a turn for the better regarding the issues I've just highlighted here.I ordered all three complete seasons and will be digging into the second one tonight.

893748,A29R3O02O0PON4,B0007XG266,"Razr Maxx ""Metal Head""","[5, 14]","First off, I'd like to say that I agree with both Michael S. Smith's review and M. Koby's review.Watching this series for the first time, sans one episode I saw a couple weeks ago, on DVD, I can honestly say that this show is actually pretty damn good.As those reviewers said, if you compare this to the '92-'95, series TAS and '97's Gotham Knights, then you might be disappointed.  But if you don't, and view this show with an open mind, it's a good take on the Batman character and Bruce Wayne.  Like M. Koby said, this show focuses on the struggles of Bruce Wayne trying to stike a balance between being Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Thankfully, this time, Bruce Wayne prefers to be Batman, as he cotinues to fight to rid Gotham City of the criminal element and to continue the legacy of his parents.But enough of that...let's talk about the technical issues of this show.  First off, the animation, once you get used to it, is absolutely brilliant.  Yes, it's not TAS stuff, but that's a good thing in this case.  The animators use a blend of traditional cell animation and CG enhancementss, both in lighting effects and 3D modeling.  IMO, it ranks right up there with the 2003 MTV Spider-Man series.Now then, the reimagined character designs, specifically the rogues gallery.  Some have said that they don't like some of the liberties the creators have taken with the origins of some of the villians.  I can understand that.  The new origin of Clayface is totally different than his original comic book origin.  But that's fine.  As M. Koby said, if you just throw out all comic book continuity and look at this series as its own new Batman world, then you can grow to like it.Currently this show is in its 3rd season and I hope that they'll do enough seasons to get in that 60-80 episode count like they did with TAS.  After watching this first season, I am really looking forward to the second season release in September.I'll leave you with this thought.  Even though this show is billed as a Saturday morning kid's show (DC Kid's Collection), I'm 32 and I enjoyed this series a bit more than TAS.  However, I liked Gotham Knights (Vol. 4) pretty well too.  I'm hoping I'll like Batman Beyond too.

While the 'bringing them to justice' part might not change in this series, everything else does.Batman is no longer the dark hero he used to be. He's turned into a  young, cocky, 'style over substance' character which can only have been made up in the minds of the corporate focus groups who created this fluff. While older incarnations of batman (such as his excellent portrayal in the Animated series which ran from '92 to '99) had Batman as a character that could be enjoyed by adults and kids, this show portrays him in a way that would get a him killed in any other Gotham city.Bruce Wayne's ""reimagining"" is that of a shallow guy who doesn't seem realistic at all if you post him into the world of Gotham City that all the older Batman's lived in. But Bruce Wayne as a shallow guy whose poor acting doesn't support the show is only the half of it. One thing that made all the other Batman shows so great was the portrayal of the villains as interesting people. Not here.Joker has turned into a big demon-faced guy with no personality (a huge difference from Mark Hamill's amazing portrayal of Joker in both The Batman Antimated Series and Batman Beyond) Mr. Freeze has no reason to be doing what he's doing anymore (he looks like a demon with an icecube on his head, which Batman makes fun of with some horrible puns). And Penguin...well basically EVERY villan in the series looks like a demon. Not surprising, because this show was designed by the people who did the Jackie Chan Adventures (a show about demons). But Batman isn't about demons, it's supposed to be about the humanity of the characters. The depth, and not just the style.This show falls through in story, acting, and is barely held together by the style. Old Batman fans will be horrified, comic book fans will be disgusted, and new fans will have their image of Batman forever tarnished. It's very obvious that this show was made for money to cash in on the new movie of Batman, and not because of any love for the characters.

Warner Home Video has finally wised up, ditched the meager single discs and given fans and collectors an affordable way to get this series on dvd.But wait...are there any fans and collectors? The general bat-fan will tell you this show sucks, while the small but vocal die-hards will pump The Batman for all its worth. This is a very difficult show to rate. Not only does it feel like Batman as envisioned by corporate focus groups, but the general writing is way below par compared to the classic Batman: Animated series.In my opinion, these problems are mostly confined to the first season. This is definitely the show at its worst, and the newer seasons have been much more kinetic and entertaining. It's painful here to watch Bruce eat nachos and cast opera aside for bubblegum pop. It's painful to watch him resort to an endless array of bat-gadgets to take down foes. But the show has occasional moments of brilliance. When Batman slips into a coma after being thrashed by Bane, there's a very poignant look at the night of his parents' murder. The villain designs, wacky and grotesque as they may be, are fiercely original and fun if you go in with the right expectations. And the season finale, written by Gargoyles creator Greg Weisman, brings the show to a near-BTAS level with a brand new interpretation of Clayface. It's really worth checking out.Again, this is a difficult recommendation. Season 1 is mostly weak, and I can't blame anyone for shunning it. However, the second season onwards is definitely worth looking into. I at least give kudos to WB for giving us The Batman in a season set that has more appeal to adult collectors. For those on the fence, check out season 2 when/if it is eventually released, then go back and see if you'd like season 1 for completion purposes.

BTAS was, is, and will remain one of TV's crowning achievements in animation.  This new series doesn't aspire to anything that lofty-it's kid-vid. Judge it that way.I'm 40 years old with a 10-year-old superhero-loving daughter. We watch the show together. We understand this show is a new riff. It has something of an anime influence, and it works. The show looks awesome. The theme music, by The Edge of U2, is very cool. Let's look at the characters. (BTW-don't look for Comissioner Gordon, Batgirl, Robin, Bullock, Montoya-they're not here. At least, not yet)Batman/Bruce Wayne: He's young, he's just starting, he makes mistakes, and he's still having fun.Alfred: One of the best parts of this show. Really captures the complex fellow that Alfred is.Villains on this disc:Joker: A Joker who is Bruce's equal in hand-to-hand combat? Neither my daughter or I care for this take on Batman's biggest foe.Bane: Interesting version. Tad over-the-top, but what the heck. The episode does highlight Bruce's brainpower over brawn. The introduction of Rupert Thorne is a nice touch.Penguin. This one flat-out-works. You really get a feel for what makes Oswald Cobblepot tick. They take the high-society-wannabee aspect of Paul Williams from BTAS, and add a true sense of menace.Other villains from later in the series:Catwoman: Get the costume right. My daughter and I call her Mousewoman.Mr. Freeze: Worst of all the reimaginings. They've taken the most incredible tragic character from BTAS (and the DC Universe in general) and reduced him to a common jewel thief. Pathetic.Clayface: Awesome. The two-part origin special may be the best episode so far. The production team really found their feet on this one. A Gotham cop gone horribly wrong through no fault of his own. Hearkens back to BTAS's treatment of Victor Fries.Riddler: Loved it. Looks cool, and so far seems to be Batman's intellectual equal.Bottom line: Batman can survive any reworking. From the camp of the '60s TV show to Frank Miller's brooding Dark Knight, the icon remains. ""The Batman"" is a update for a new audience, no more, no less.

893757,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B0007XG266,Tom Birkenstock,"[48, 60]","Let's start with what I do like.  The style of the cartoon is actually pretty good.  At first I was a little turned off by the whole ""X-treme"" Batman, but considering this is Bruce Wayne in his younger days I think it works.However, the characters are reduced to nothing.  Batman has absolutely no edge to him.  In the original series we got to know his past and saw him really struggle with the death of his parents, and lets be honest, the best thing about Batman is that he's the first superhero who's given a real motive.  In this series the death of his parents are brough up a few times, but as a driving force it's generally ignored.The villians are all one-note characters.  In the original series each villian had some kind of conflict.  It wasn't just good versus evil; it was about that in-between grey.  The Man-Bat is just some mad scientist.  Mr. Freeze is just some jewel thief.  They're run of the mill pedestrian characters.  The only exception is Clay Face.  Lets hope this new version of Clay Face is pointing to a new direction to the series.  Maybe the writers will wise up and give us some good stories.

893758,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,B0007XG266,trebe,"[1, 1]","Having previously done Batman The Animated Series (1992-95), Warner Brothers new animated series featuring Batman takes a new approach, with a fresh spin on the character.  In The Batman (2005), millionaire Bruce Wayne is 26, and has been operating as a masked crimefighter for just three years.  Regarded by the police as a vigilante who takes the law into his own hands, Batman is an outlaw.  Faithful Wayne family butler, Alfred Pennywell is a younger, tech savvy fellow, who takes a very active part in assisting young Bruce in all he does.This is an intriguing approach to the character, and one where the perspective is distinctly modern, and overwhelmingly high tech.  The Batman utilizes a plethora of tools, gadgets and weapons.  The Batmobile is completely remote controllable, racing through the streets without a driver.  Achieving flight using various mechanical devices, and even donning a mechanized armored Batbot suit, this version of Batman makes such extensive use of technology, that he approaches possessing superpowers.No matter the time period, utilizing the latest in technology and science, is natural to Batman, although whether this exaggerated version goes too far, is open to question.  While some may find the extensive integration of technology interesting, those who favor a more traditional interpretation, may be appalled by the changes to the parameters of the Batman universe.  For a character that is over 60 years old, change is almost inevitable.  The program also provides new interpretations of some of Batman's classic villains.The action is usually fast paced, with some compelling stories.  The episode `Call Of The Cobblepot', features an interesting look at the origin of The Penguin.  Bane makes an explosive and terrifying appearance in `Traction'.  In `The Cat And The Bat', Catwoman exposes the Batman's dependence on technology, when she steals his utility belt and takes control of the Batmobile and other devices.  Firefly makes an impressive debut in `The Big Heat', as a villain with remarkable technical expertise and deadly laser weapons.  And for a journey into to absurd, there is `Q&A;', which features The Cluemaster, an intellectual giant who holds a grudge, and has an imaginative plan to extract his revenge.The Batman is high on police Chief Angel Rojas's most wanted list, with detectives Ellen Yin and Ethan Bennett, often assigned to cases involving The Bat.  Bennett is a childhood friend of Bruce Wayne, who as an unfortunate victim of the Joker's putty, is transformed into Clayface.  Detective Yin loses her partner in the season finale, but also gains The Batman's trust, setting the stage for their loose partnership in season two.The series is a bold strike in a new direction, with very nicely done animation, however Batman's heavy reliance on technology, reshapes the way he operates, and at times completely takes over the proceedings.  Each iteration of Batman has its fans and detractors, and there are positives and negatives about this version, which would continue to evolve during its five season run.  Because of the violence, and mildly adult themes, this program is not really suitable for young children.  The collection has a nice set of extras, including a couple of quizzes.",4,high tech Batman . . .,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",2010,3266,"['Having', 'previously', 'done', 'Batman', 'Animated', 'Series', '1992-95', 'Warner', 'Brothers', 'new', 'animated', 'series', 'featuring', 'Batman', 'new', 'approach', 'fresh', 'spin', 'character', 'Batman', '2005', 'millionaire', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', '26', 'been', 'operating', 'masked', 'crimefighter', 'just', 'three', 'years', 'Regarded', 'police', 'vigilante', 'who', 'law', 'own', 'hands', 'Batman', 'outlaw', 'Faithful', 'Wayne', 'family', 'butler', 'Alfred', 'Pennywell', 'younger', 'tech', 'savvy', 'fellow', 'who', 'very', 'active', 'part', 'assisting', 'young', 'Bruce', 'intriguing', 'approach', 'character', 'one', 'where', 'perspective', 'distinctly', 'modern', 'overwhelmingly', 'high', 'tech', 'Batman', 'plethora', 'tools', 'gadgets', 'weapons', 'Batmobile', 'completely', 'remote', 'controllable', 'racing', 'streets', 'driver', 'Achieving', 'flight', 'using', 'various', 'mechanical', 'devices', 'even', 'donning', 'mechanized', 'armored', 'Batbot', 'suit', 'version', 'Batman', 'such', 'extensive', 'use', 'technology', 'possessing', 'superpowers.No', 'matter', 'time', 'period', 'utilizing', 'latest', 'technology', 'science', 'natural', 'Batman', 'exaggerated', 'version', 'too', 'far', 'open', 'question', 'may', 'find', 'extensive', 'integration', 'technology', 'interesting', 'who', 'favor', 'more', 'traditional', 'interpretation', 'may', 'be', 'appalled', 'changes', 'parameters', 'Batman', 'universe', 'character', '60', 'years', 'old', 'change', 'almost', 'inevitable', 'program', 'also', 'new', 'interpretations', 'Batman', 'classic', 'villains.The', 'action', 'usually', 'fast', 'paced', 'compelling', 'stories', 'episode', 'Call', 'Cobblepot', 'interesting', 'look', 'origin', 'Penguin', 'Bane', 'explosive', 'terrifying', 'appearance', 'Traction', 'Cat', 'Bat', 'Catwoman', 'Batman', 'dependence', 'technology', 'when', 'steals', 'utility', 'belt', 'control', 'Batmobile', 'other', 'devices', 'Firefly', 'impressive', 'debut', 'Big', 'Heat', 'villain', 'remarkable', 'technical', 'expertise', 'deadly', 'laser', 'weapons', 'journey', 'absurd', 'Q', 'A', 'Cluemaster', 'intellectual', 'giant', 'who', 'grudge', 'imaginative', 'plan', 'extract', 'revenge.The', 'Batman', 'high', 'police', 'Chief', 'Angel', 'Rojas', 'most', 'wanted', 'list', 'detectives', 'Ellen', 'Yin', 'Ethan', 'Bennett', 'often', 'assigned', 'cases', 'involving', 'Bat', 'Bennett', 'childhood', 'friend', 'Bruce', 'Wayne', 'who', 'unfortunate', 'victim', 'Joker', 'putty', 'transformed', 'Clayface', 'Detective', 'Yin', 'partner', 'season', 'finale', 'also', 'gains', 'Batman', 'trust', 'setting', 'stage', 'loose', 'partnership', 'season', 'two.The', 'series', 'bold', 'strike', 'new', 'direction', 'very', 'nicely', 'done', 'animation', 'however', 'Batman', 'heavy', 'reliance', 'technology', 'way', 'times', 'completely', 'proceedings', 'iteration', 'Batman', 'fans', 'detractors', 'are', 'positives', 'negatives', 'version', 'would', 'continue', 'evolve', 'five', 'season', 'run', 'violence', 'mildly', 'adult', 'themes', 'program', 'not', 'really', 'suitable', 'young', 'children', 'collection', 'nice', 'set', 'extras', 'including', 'couple', 'quizzes']","The Batman: Training for Power Season 1, Vol. 1"
893759,A1GMH7UI999M4P,B0007XG266,"Trevis ""xyrodon""","[3, 6]","First off, the Batman animated series man in the 1990's was top notch and amazing. This new show may not live up to those very high standards, however, that doesn't mean that this new animated series is crap. First off, Alan Burnett, someone who was part of the team that made the Batman: TAS version in the 1990's, made this show. The show is in my opinion, top notch. AMAZING and beautiful animation, the characters all look awesome. I love the drawings. The plots that are each script aren't as weak as everyone says they are. This show almost beats every animated cartoon made on air currently.The fights are the biggest improvement. Batman actually fights the way he was meant to fight, he display a great variety of techniques. I love the new fight scenes!!  He's much more agile and the choreography of the fights are incredible, almost anime like.  I mean, why shouldn't they be?  It's Batman!!  All those years of training, he better be able to do this. I love the new acrobatic skills Batman displays in this show!!The Clayface story, like the two face story (which Alan Burnett also wrote) is pretty deep. I like it, a lot. Yes, it's not two face, so what? It's a NEW Batman people. In case you're wondering, the 90's version of Batman changed many concepts of Batman from the comics, MANY CONCEPTS!! This show is also doing the same thing. Some aren't that great (I didn't like the change in Mr. Freeze and Bane) and some are much better (Spellbinder is just a WICKED villain, Clayface is really cool, The Riddler is much more clever in this version).Overall, people are being a bit too critical. It's not a perfect show and it will get better. We still have yet to see Rhaas Al Guul, which I'm sure is bound to be a treat. I like this show, it's great. It's not the 1990's version, or Justice League, but it's enjoyable.",5,"The new Batman is really good show, stop being so critical!",1154304000,"07 31, 2006",2006,1833,"['First', 'off', 'Batman', 'animated', 'series', 'man', '1990', 'was', 'top', 'notch', 'amazing', 'new', 'show', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'very', 'high', 'standards', 'however', ""n't"", 'mean', 'new', 'animated', 'series', 'crap', 'First', 'Alan', 'Burnett', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'part', 'team', 'made', 'Batman', 'TAS', 'version', '1990', 'made', 'show', 'show', 'opinion', 'top', 'notch', 'AMAZING', 'beautiful', 'animation', 'characters', 'look', 'awesome', 'love', 'drawings', 'plots', 'are', 'script', 'are', ""n't"", 'as', 'weak', 'everyone', 'are', 'show', 'almost', 'animated', 'cartoon', 'made', 'air', 'currently.The', 'fights', 'are', 'biggest', 'improvement', 'Batman', 'actually', 'way', 'was', 'meant', 'fight', 'display', 'great', 'variety', 'techniques', 'love', 'new', 'fight', 'scenes', 'much', 'more', 'agile', 'choreography', 'fights', 'are', 'incredible', 'almost', 'mean', 'why', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'Batman', 'years', 'training', 'better', 'be', 'able', 'do', 'love', 'new', 'acrobatic', 'skills', 'Batman', 'show', 'Clayface', 'story', 'two', 'face', 'story', 'Alan', 'Burnett', 'also', 'wrote', 'pretty', 'deep', 'lot', 'Yes', 'not', 'two', 'face', 'what', 'NEW', 'Batman', 'people', 'case', ""'re"", 'wondering', '90', 'version', 'Batman', 'changed', 'many', 'concepts', 'Batman', 'comics', 'MANY', 'CONCEPTS', 'show', 'also', 'doing', 'same', 'thing', 'are', ""n't"", 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'change', 'Mr', 'Freeze', 'Bane', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'Spellbinder', 'just', 'WICKED', 'villain', 'Clayface', 'really', 'cool', 'Riddler', 'much', 'more', 'clever', 'version', '.Overall', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'bit', 'too', 'critical', 'not', 'perfect', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'better', 'still', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'Rhaas', 'Al', 'Guul', ""'m"", 'sure', 'bound', 'be', 'treat', 'show', 'great', 'not', '1990', 'version', 'Justice', 'League', 'enjoyable']","The Batman: Training for Power Season 1, Vol. 1"

893761,AIJJB21124MW3,B0007XG266,William of Florida,"[1, 1]","Batman is easily the most adaptable of comic book/cartoon characters. He's already survived so many wonderful interpretations. I grew up with Batman:TAS. By the time I reached high school, Batman Beyond was announced. I hated the idea. I was so determined to hate it that I tuned in to watch the hour long premier so that I could complain about it the next day. My plans were foiled when it ended up being an awesome show, if not my favorite Batman show.A similar thing happened with 'The Batman.'This time, I just didn't give it the time of day. It wasn't until I saw an inexpensive used copy of Season 1 at a local video store that I decided to give it a shot (this was early December 2009, BTW. So...Recent!).I quickly realized that this is just the newest interpretation. By DC terms, it's a new universe. It isn't intended to replace Batman TAS, it is intended to present this amazing character to a new generation in a new way. So if you're overly nostalgic about the 90's show, then this might not be the best show for you. If you are open to new takes on Batman, then check it out. It's pretty good.Some of the characters have been re-imagined. However, they typically fit the style and tone of the show and have been given interesting new back stories. Characters like Joker, the Penguin, Catwoman and Bane have all been retooled, but not so much that they are no longer themselves. Mr.Freeze and Clayface are the exceptions, both of them being quite different from previous incarnations, but are both cool in their own right. In fact, on more than one occasion, I have heard younger relatives talk about how cool they think the villains in the show look. I'm not 'with it' so I won't attempt to quote them.Batman himself is interesting. The gadgets bothered me in the first few episodes, but they made sense after a few more. This Batman lives in a modern world. A hero who has always been on the cutting edge probably could have a lot of the newer and tech-ed up gadgets this Batman has. It took me a bit, but I got used to it and came to look for new gadgets as I did in the movies and the 60's show.There have been comments about Bruce being too lighthearted. This is also something that I think is perfectly understandable. He's still young. Years of hero-ing haven't phased him yet because they haven't happened yet. This Bruce behaves exactly as a 26 year old Bruce Wayne should. He isn't the guy from the comics yet. Honestly, I rather enjoy that we're getting to see him from his early days as a crime fighter.As previous posters have said, the first few episodes are rocky. In fact, I would say that the first few episodes feel like Batman caught in an early Jackie Chan Adventures show. They're still pretty good, but not great.Overall, I say give this season a try. The show only gets better as you go along.Three and a half stars from me.
