1694334,A9NCVAXA0PM9I,B00IJZMZW4,buck,"[2, 2]","This just shows how a trailer can fool you. This movie had potential, but it just fell flat. The things I was interested in ( like the robberies and the whys), the movie barely touched on in a bad way. The things that I didn't care for ( like the drug addicted mom or the sex scenes between 40 year old men), it constantly showed. I wanted more out of that main character, who is also on General Hospital. All of the actors in the film appear to be older than 35, but the film seems to be aimed at teenagers. Now I know that life is too short to take it seriously all the time, but the line has to be drawn somewhere. My advice is to rent instead of buy. Once you watch it one time, you won't want to watch it again.",2,Stale Cheese,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2014,716,"['just', 'how', 'trailer', 'can', 'fool', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'just', 'fell', 'flat', 'things', 'was', 'interested', 'robberies', 'whys', 'movie', 'barely', 'touched', 'bad', 'way', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'drug', 'addicted', 'mom', 'sex', 'scenes', '40', 'year', 'old', 'men', 'constantly', 'showed', 'wanted', 'more', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'also', 'General', 'Hospital', 'actors', 'film', 'appear', 'be', 'older', '35', 'film', 'be', 'aimed', 'teenagers', 'Now', 'know', 'life', 'too', 'short', 'take', 'seriously', 'time', 'line', 'be', 'drawn', 'somewhere', 'My', 'advice', 'rent', 'instead', 'buy', 'watch', 'one', 'time', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'watch', 'again']",Hot Guys With Guns

There is very little action (of both the sexual and violent variety), and there isn't even much camp. There are some funny moments, but not nearly enough of them. Hot Guys With Guns is mostly dull.
