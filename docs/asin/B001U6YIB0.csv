1238465,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B001U6YIB0,Acute Observer,"[1, 4]","Time Limit, 1957 filmThe movie starts in North Korea where American prisoners are kept in a hut. One tries to escape and is shot. Next we see Governors Island in New York harbor. The Army has a map of Korea on a wall. There is an investigation into the Cargill case. Back in Korea prisoners receive a lecture from another prisoner on the class struggle. [Is his lecture well-received? Brain washing?] The other prisoners walk away. Why did he go over? Some prisoners died of untreated dysentery. ""Guys who think too much can be fooled."" [Should people be allowed to think for themselves?] Major Henry Cargill arrived. He is read his rights. He admits to the charges to get things over as quickly as possible; he is guilty as charged. But he reacts to hearing his recorded voices. [On the street you see automobiles from the early 1950s.] Colonel Edwards visits Mrs. Cargill to talk about Henry. Her husband doesn't talk about his life as a prisoner. Can people have decent thoughts about the human race? Did Henry have any special fear about one thing?What was the ""causative factor""? Why did those witnesses all use the same wording (""an acute case of dysentery"")? The general wants action now! The Sergeant talks about Army life. Can pressure change someone's mind? [Yes.] Did his words affect the opinions of 200 million people? Lt. George Miller starts talking about what they wouldn't talk about. One man was chosen by lot. The prisoners are looking for someone to blame for Harvey's death, and pick Connors. There is a very dramatic confrontation in the Colonel's office. General Connors demands the truth. His son was killed by his own men! ""Conclusive proof."" ""Every man has his limits."" Major Cargill explains what happened, he cooperated to save the lives of his men. Was this a mistake? [Yes.] The General asks for the recommendation right now. Every leader has to accept casualties. The Colonel will defend Major Cargill, since the wheels of justice must operate. [The rest of the story is left to your imagination.]The static situations in this movie suggest it came from a stage play. This drama asks a very interesting philosophical question about prisoners trying to survive. The fact is that among any group of people some will chose to collaborate, or even join the enemy. During the early days of the Civil War many of the captured agreed to change sides; then deserted at the first chance they got. The phrase was ""galvanized Yankees"". Some deserted during the War with Mexico. You could read some histories about Europe in the 20th century, or earlier. Sometimes the whole country would switch sides at an opportune moment.",3,Collaboration With the Enemy,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,2644,"['Time', 'Limit', '1957', 'filmThe', 'movie', 'North', 'Korea', 'where', 'American', 'prisoners', 'are', 'kept', 'hut', 'One', 'escape', 'shot', 'Next', 'see', 'Governors', 'Island', 'New', 'York', 'harbor', 'Army', 'map', 'Korea', 'wall', 'investigation', 'Cargill', 'case', 'Back', 'Korea', 'prisoners', 'receive', 'lecture', 'prisoner', 'class', 'struggle', '[', 'lecture', 'well-received', 'Brain', 'washing', 'other', 'prisoners', 'walk', 'away', 'Why', 'did', 'go', 'over', 'prisoners', 'died', 'untreated', 'dysentery', 'Guys', 'who', 'think', 'too', 'much', 'can', 'be', 'fooled', '[', 'Should', 'people', 'be', 'allowed', 'think', 'Major', 'Henry', 'Cargill', 'arrived', 'read', 'rights', 'charges', 'get', 'things', 'as', 'quickly', 'possible', 'guilty', 'charged', 'hearing', 'recorded', 'voices', '[', 'street', 'see', 'automobiles', 'early', '1950s', ']', 'Colonel', 'Edwards', 'Mrs.', 'Cargill', 'talk', 'Henry', 'husband', ""n't"", 'talk', 'life', 'prisoner', 'Can', 'people', 'have', 'decent', 'thoughts', 'human', 'race', 'Did', 'Henry', 'have', 'special', 'fear', 'one', 'thing', 'What', 'was', 'causative', 'factor', 'Why', 'did', 'witnesses', 'use', 'same', 'wording', 'acute', 'case', 'dysentery', 'general', 'action', 'now', 'Sergeant', 'talks', 'Army', 'life', 'Can', 'pressure', 'change', 'someone', 'mind', '[', 'Yes', ']', 'Did', 'words', 'affect', 'opinions', '200', 'million', 'people', 'Lt.', 'George', 'Miller', 'talking', 'what', 'would', ""n't"", 'talk', 'One', 'man', 'was', 'chosen', 'lot', 'prisoners', 'are', 'looking', 'someone', 'blame', 'Harvey', 'death', 'pick', 'Connors', 'very', 'dramatic', 'confrontation', 'Colonel', 'office', 'General', 'Connors', 'truth', 'son', 'was', 'killed', 'own', 'men', 'Conclusive', 'proof', 'man', 'limits', 'Major', 'Cargill', 'what', 'happened', 'cooperated', 'save', 'lives', 'men', 'Was', 'mistake', '[', 'Yes', ']', 'General', 'recommendation', 'right', 'now', 'leader', 'accept', 'casualties', 'Colonel', 'will', 'defend', 'Major', 'Cargill', 'wheels', 'justice', 'must', 'operate', '[', 'rest', 'story', 'left', 'imagination', ']', 'static', 'situations', 'movie', 'suggest', 'came', 'stage', 'play', 'drama', 'very', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'question', 'prisoners', 'trying', 'survive', 'fact', 'group', 'people', 'will', 'chose', 'collaborate', 'even', 'join', 'enemy', 'early', 'days', 'Civil', 'War', 'many', 'captured', 'agreed', 'change', 'sides', 'then', 'deserted', 'first', 'chance', 'got', 'phrase', 'was', 'galvanized', 'Yankees', 'deserted', 'War', 'Mexico', 'could', 'read', 'histories', 'Europe', '20th', 'century', 'earlier', 'Sometimes', 'whole', 'country', 'would', 'switch', 'sides', 'opportune', 'moment']",Time Limit

1238470,A3SJU7T0G9OXDN,B001U6YIB0,Mike Crestwood,"[0, 1]","UPSIDE: this could have been a very good Korean War drama.  It is based on a true story (United States v Fleming) of a US Army major who is accused of turning traitor to his country for no good reason. The major made broadcasts and signed documents the North Koreans used for propaganda purposes. Like the real story, he was put on trial by the US Army for helping the enemy. This movie takes that story and adds in the murder of a different Army officer by his fellow soldiers who believed he snitched a planned escape to his captors, and was killed by fellow POWs for his duplicity.  DOWNSIDE: This is a spoiler alert! The movie fails on logic grounds. All along we're led to believe the major ""broke"" down, but his true motives in corroborating are only revealed at the end of the movie. At the end its revealed that the major was covering up the murder he tried to stop. Really? Admitting to traitorous conduct and risk going to prison for twenty years, especially after the war was over and he was safely back in the USA? Logically, he would have told the Army of the murder.  Also, if his ""breaking down"" and corroborating was really a ploy to get the POW Camp C.O. to feed his men (as the major says in the end), he would not have continued giving pro-commie lectures in the camp when the C.O. wasn't present.  That makes the second scene in the movie illogical. Either he really ""broke"" (which is what the writers want you to believe almost the entire movie) OR he chose to appear to break to feed his men (as revealed at the end). The movie's writers can't have it both ways.",2,Fair War Drama,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",2013,1584,"['UPSIDE', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'Korean', 'War', 'drama', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'United', 'States', 'v', 'Fleming', 'US', 'Army', 'major', 'who', 'accused', 'turning', 'traitor', 'country', 'good', 'reason', 'major', 'made', 'broadcasts', 'signed', 'documents', 'North', 'Koreans', 'used', 'propaganda', 'purposes', 'real', 'story', 'was', 'put', 'trial', 'US', 'Army', 'helping', 'enemy', 'movie', 'story', 'murder', 'different', 'Army', 'officer', 'fellow', 'soldiers', 'who', 'believed', 'snitched', 'planned', 'escape', 'captors', 'was', 'killed', 'fellow', 'POWs', 'duplicity', 'DOWNSIDE', 'spoiler', 'alert', 'movie', 'logic', 'grounds', 'All', ""'re"", 'led', 'believe', 'major', 'broke', 'down', 'true', 'motives', 'corroborating', 'are', 'only', 'revealed', 'end', 'movie', 'end', 'revealed', 'major', 'was', 'covering', 'up', 'murder', 'tried', 'stop', 'Really', 'Admitting', 'traitorous', 'conduct', 'risk', 'going', 'prison', 'twenty', 'years', 'especially', 'war', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'safely', 'back', 'USA', 'Logically', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'Army', 'murder', 'Also', 'breaking', 'down', 'corroborating', 'was', 'really', 'ploy', 'get', 'POW', 'Camp', 'C.O', 'feed', 'men', 'major', 'end', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'continued', 'giving', 'pro-commie', 'lectures', 'camp', 'when', 'C.O', 'was', ""n't"", 'present', 'second', 'scene', 'movie', 'illogical', 'really', 'broke', 'what', 'writers', 'want', 'believe', 'almost', 'entire', 'movie', 'chose', 'appear', 'break', 'feed', 'men', 'revealed', 'end', 'movie', 'writers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways']",Time Limit

The take on what constitutes treason based on how POWs were treated by North Korea was given its time of release at the height of the Cold War a very bold story line.2. While Richard Widmark's role proves acting the heavy and not the good guy would always be his forte the performances of Richard Basehart as the accused major and Martin Balsam as the closed minded adjutant to Widmark's Colonel prove that each were well capable of greater things though fate was ultimately kinder to Balsam in this regard in their respective careers.3.
