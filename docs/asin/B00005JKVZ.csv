591316,AADJXNY9HSKJF,B00005JKVZ,Aaron,"[0, 0]",Recent teen movies have pretty much showed teens as cold and uncaring. This movie does nothing of the sort. A very likable cast displays emotion and yet they remain very believable.The movie is about an 18 year old boy the name of Landon Carter (Shane West) who is your typical high school &quot;big man on campus&quot; who gets himself into some trouble. He ends up getting involved with misfit Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) when he's forced to participate in his high school's spring play. The story takes off from there and i don't want to give away any spoilers. Shane West's acting is terrific but the real star is Mandy Moore who definitely displays the fact that she has acting talent and is definitely a young person to watch for in the future. The movie's love themes are not mushy *surprisingly* and the corny moments are pretty forgivable and handled well by the cast. &quot;A walk To Remember&quot; is definitely a movie to remember and a must see. It's not just for teens either. Anyone can enjoy it.

Jamie's a bore with a few secrets from the world in the beginning. But once she finally hooks up with Landon who really wasn't her type at first, things start to change and she does things that she's held back for too long.Is it typical? Yeah. Sometimes. But you get to hear Mandy sing her heart out on ""Only Hope"" one of Switchfoot's most touching ballads ever. John Foreman and his brother wrote it I believe.Everything is peachy save for the haters at school (they make fun of and pick at Jamie for being the ""Virgin Mary"" and try to get Landon to break it off) and Jamie's father's disapproval of their relationship at all. Even worse, something very sad and tragic is revealed by Mandy's character (Jamie) and sends things into a downward spiral. The movie gets 10x as serious here.Overall, it's recommended.

591320,A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ,B00005JKVZ,"A. Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[1, 4]","Is love an instantaneous combustion?  Can two nobodies, living at opposite ends of the social Earth, suddenly fall in love, change their lives, and live a happy co-existence together (well, not forever in this movie - but you get my drift)?  This is the question that I tackled while watching another cookie be cut from the Hollywood bakery - this time it was called ""A Walk to Remember"".  An adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novel by the same name, it focuses on the fairy tale blossom of love between quintessential bad boy Landon Carter (played dramatically by Shane West) and bible-thumping, dust in the wind, clich&eacute; bookworm Jamie Sullivan (played by first timer Mandy Moore).  As always, we begin with Landon's hijinks, followed by consequences which bring Jamie and him together.  Sparks fly?  Hardly, but they continue to encounter each other, each imposing their lives into one another, and finally - through Hollywood magic fall in love.  What happens in the following acts is classic Sparks as tears begin to play a pivotal element in the closing moments.  As I mentioned in my review for ""The Notebook"", one cannot help but wonder if the Kleenex corporation doesn't keep Mr. Sparks, or these films, on retainer.I do not mean to be so harsh with my opening, but one needs to realize that this film, to me, felt stale.  I, as well as anyone that has ever watched a full length film, have seen all of these elements before.  With ""A Walk to Remember"", I was not impressed or surprised.  Perhaps a bit jaded knowing what would happen before it did due largely in part to whispers by huge fans of this film, but I walked away from this as I had with other Shankman films.  There could have been potential, but instead it suffered from Hollywood similarities, which ultimately left me with quite a bit of Hollywood boredom.  Gasp! Did he say that?  Yep, I was bored with this film.  The lack of humor, the randomness of chance, and the simplicity of the plot left me wanting, desiring, desperately waiting for something imaginative, creative, or unique to happen.  Alas, nothing - I repeat - nothing of the sort occurred.  From the clich&eacute; play, to the reuniting of family, to the forced tear-jerker of an ending, ""A Walk to Remember"" proved yet again that one could make film cookies out of the same, overused batch of cookie dough time and time again while consumers will still stumble across the counter to grab.  Why is this?  Was it the hunky-ness of Shane West, who did provide with at least a glimmer of acting ability (though his tear scenes were hysterical at best)?  Was it that we were hoping for something from Mandy Moore, who only proved that speaking in a small voice and wearing pasty make-up will make audiences cry?  Personally, I believe the hype surrounding this film arrives from the name Spark, Nicholas Sparks.  It was his name that carried this film, and I cannot say that the new translation fit his story well enough to matter.As I watched this film, it was the secondary characters that really attracted my attention.  Daryl Hannah must have just signed for this ""gig"" mainly for the paycheck, as she looked especially man-ish in her role.  I was a bit startled when I saw her at first, then transformed into confusion as I tried to figure out what sort of mother-role she was attempting.  The same can be said for Jamie's father, whom in my eyes, carried this film.  I wanted more dynamic between her and him, their differences and their personal loss - as only you could find in Sparks' story.  He fit the mold of what this film represented.  He was a father - one that nearly anyone could relate to.  There was Landon's friends, which played out like a horrid 80s film completely filled with sucker punches, unfunny jokes, and that snobbish ""popular"" behavior that seems to drench any teen film head to toe.  How did Al Thompson get all the jokes for the film ... could anyone else be any funnier?  While I appreciated the levity he brought, there wasn't much to the film to make one feel sad.  I say this not because of what happened in the final act, but because there wasn't enough emotion brought to the characters for me to be compelled enough to let my tear ducts express themselves.Overall, I cannot suggest this film to anyone except small teens that are not allowed to go to PG-13 films yet.  Throughout the commentary (which, subsequently, only addresses the childish nature of the film), Shankman et crew discuss how this was about to be a PG-13 film, but had to be cut - language and nudity - to appeal to a larger audience as well ensure that the religious sect would not abolish this film.  Again, I would like to point out that the makers of this piece of cinema do not consider this a ""religious"" film, but instead, a film about faith.  I didn't see that.  Faith was important to Jamie, but as the film closed, that wasn't the topic of thought.  Instead, the question of combustible relationships came to mind.  I will have to ask you to pass on this film, unless you are in middle school and have never seen a movie before in your life.Don't let your faith flame get too close to this combustible relationship

Characters are poorly developed, the plot is choppy and inconsistent, the cliches are utterly blatant, and the movie is predictable. In short, it is your average syrupy dip of cotton candy fluff.Yet, I am ashamed to say that there is something redeeming about this film. There is a certain poignant, hidden honesty. Perhaps the movie pulls on the universal strings of human nature in the right way.You have the damsel in distress. The bad dude who saves her, and, in turn, is saved. The father who hates him, but grows to appreciate him. Oh, and sundry bathos filled scenes that blatantly attempt to pull the tears from your lacrimal glands.Like an under-ager sneeking cigarrette, this movie is a guilty pleasure. It is hard to hate Mandy Moore's character (however inconsistent her development). She is uber-innocent, exists in a ethereal world, and is picked on by all of the people you hated in high-school. She gives this film what life it has. The viewer feels a certain attraction to her-even if this attraction is contrived in formulaic fashion.One must note the irony here. The movie is making a moral point of telling you that it is not cool to pick on dorks, geeks, or what have you. Yet, in order to make us feel guilty for picking on the weak and meek, they choose a beautiful, lustrous young woman. Who would pick on her?! I guess it would not have the same resonance if they picked an ugly, importunate dork. Owell, such are the foibles of mankind.At any rate, I found it hard to despise this mawkish flick despite its blatant limitations. Perhaps, in some quixotic universe, unalloyed love and redemption do exist. Perhaps pure salvation is possible. At the least, sane humans hope for such things. To paraphrase a classic quote from the movie, hope is like the wind, you can't see it but you can sure feel it!!

591327,A2PUYMR4W89GUY,B00005JKVZ,Amanda,"[0, 0]","I rented A Walk To Remember because I wanted something to do. I didn't really want to see it, mainly because it looked schmaltzy and sappy and it stars teen singer Mandy Moore. But I like to give some movies a chance, so I rent them anyway. I just don't end up finishing some of them. With this one, I was expecting the same old teenybopper chick flick with bad acting and a bad plot.Boy, was I disappointed.It was nothing like I'd expected. Sure, the premise IS schmaltzy and sappy, but it's executed in such a way that you forget you're watching a teenybopper chick flick. Instead, you find yourself lost in the world of Landon Carter - resident bad-boy - and Jamie Sullivan - just your average plain Jane Christian gal. After a prank-gone-seriously- wrong leaves a student paralyzed, Landon is forced by the principal to engage in janitorial duties, tutor children on the weekend, and to join a production of the high school's drama club. The latter produces problems when he's given the lead role in the play, and he's having a hard time remembering his lines. So, he enlists the help of Jamie, who is also in the play. She decides to help him, even though he and his friends are always making fun of her. She tells him she'll only do it under one condition: that he not fall in love with her. He laughs and tells her she needn't worry. That would NEVER happen.Of course, just as he says that, the audience laughs as well, because we all know, from previews, that he is in fact going to fall in love with her. But what follows is unlike any romance in a teen movie. First off, Landon predictably starts turning into a good guy under Jamie's influence. But despite still (most likely) being a bad boy at heart, he seems to respect Jamie. Jamie is not your typical high school girl nowadays. She wears long dresses, and the same sweater everyday. She does not wear makeup. She talks with a soft, sweet voice that reveals just how sweet and innocent she really is. She is the daughter of a preacher, she's in the church choir, and she carries the bible everywhere with her. Yet Landon recognizes that she is a remarkable young woman, and he doesn't even care what his friends think (they think he's crazy, by the way).Perhaps the biggest surprise of this film is Mandy Moore. You know her. She was whom you once labeled a ""Britney wannabe"". Well, now Britney should be a ""Mandy wannabe"". Why? Because Britney, too, made her feature film debut this past year with Crossroads, in which she pretended like she could act. Crossroads was your typical teenybopper road trip chick flick, where Britney looked for any excuse to show some skin and sing some tunes. Now don't get me wrong, I was NEVER a Mandy Moore fan. But she did always hold my interest because, unlike her predecessors Britney and Christina Aguilera, Mandy has never once sold her music with sex. And now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Mandy's bellybutton. This is a major achievement in today's pop society. Mandy, who's all of 17, is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice. And - OHMYGOD - she can act! She had a small role in last year's The Princess Diaries, in which she played a snotty cheerleader. That performance was forgettable. But this one isn't. She is perfect as Jamie Sullivan. (And oh my, she's even beautiful without makeup.) Give this girl another starring role; I think she's onto something.Shane West is great too, as Landon Carter. The two of them together make a beautiful couple. And even though the ending is not original, and has been done in a few movies before, it will make you weep like a baby. But it will also make you smile. This film is a rare gem. A teen movie that really isn't a teen movie. A sappy chick flick that really isn't really a sappy chick flick. Overall, it's a feel-good movie that will make you feel bad at times. Its PG rating, which is almost profanity and sex-free, is a breath of fresh air in a time that our younger society seems to thrive on the gross-out humor of American Pie. We should all look up to Landon in Jamie. We should all hope and pray we can find a love like theirs.",4,A Film to Remember,1036800000,"11 9, 2002",2002,4119,"['rented', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'wanted', 'something', 'do', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'see', 'mainly', 'looked', 'schmaltzy', 'sappy', 'teen', 'singer', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'like', 'give', 'movies', 'chance', 'rent', 'anyway', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'end', 'up', 'finishing', 'one', 'was', 'expecting', 'same', 'old', 'teenybopper', 'chick', 'flick', 'bad', 'acting', 'bad', 'plot.Boy', 'was', 'disappointed.It', 'was', 'nothing', ""'d"", 'expected', 'Sure', 'premise', 'IS', 'schmaltzy', 'sappy', 'executed', 'such', 'way', 'forget', ""'re"", 'watching', 'teenybopper', 'chick', 'flick', 'Instead', 'find', 'lost', 'world', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'resident', 'bad-boy', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'just', 'average', 'plain', 'Jane', 'Christian', 'gal', 'prank-gone-seriously-', 'wrong', 'student', 'paralyzed', 'Landon', 'forced', 'principal', 'engage', 'janitorial', 'duties', 'tutor', 'children', 'weekend', 'join', 'production', 'high', 'school', 'drama', 'club', 'latter', 'produces', 'problems', 'when', 'given', 'lead', 'role', 'play', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'remembering', 'lines', 'So', 'help', 'Jamie', 'who', 'also', 'play', 'help', 'even', 'friends', 'are', 'always', 'making', 'fun', ""'ll"", 'only', 'do', 'one', 'condition', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'need', ""n't"", 'worry', 'would', 'NEVER', 'happen.Of', 'course', 'just', 'audience', 'as', 'well', 'know', 'previews', 'fact', 'going', 'fall', 'love', 'what', 'romance', 'teen', 'movie', 'First', 'Landon', 'predictably', 'turning', 'good', 'guy', 'Jamie', 'influence', 'still', 'most', 'likely', 'being', 'bad', 'boy', 'heart', 'respect', 'Jamie', 'Jamie', 'not', 'typical', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'nowadays', 'long', 'dresses', 'same', 'sweater', 'everyday', 'not', 'wear', 'makeup', 'soft', 'sweet', 'voice', 'just', 'how', 'sweet', 'innocent', 'really', 'daughter', 'preacher', 'church', 'choir', 'bible', 'everywhere', 'Landon', 'remarkable', 'young', 'woman', ""n't"", 'even', 'care', 'what', 'friends', 'think', 'think', 'crazy', 'way', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'know', 'was', 'whom', 'once', 'labeled', 'Britney', 'wannabe', 'Well', 'now', 'Britney', 'should', 'be', 'Mandy', 'wannabe', 'Why', 'Britney', 'too', 'made', 'feature', 'film', 'debut', 'past', 'year', 'Crossroads', 'pretended', 'could', 'act', 'Crossroads', 'was', 'typical', 'teenybopper', 'road', 'trip', 'chick', 'flick', 'where', 'Britney', 'looked', 'excuse', 'show', 'skin', 'sing', 'tunes', 'Now', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'was', 'NEVER', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'fan', 'did', 'always', 'hold', 'interest', 'predecessors', 'Britney', 'Christina', 'Aguilera', 'Mandy', 'never', 'once', 'sold', 'music', 'sex', 'now', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Mandy', 'bellybutton', 'major', 'achievement', 'today', 'pop', 'society', 'Mandy', 'who', '17', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'beautiful', 'voice', 'OHMYGOD', 'can', 'act', 'had', 'small', 'role', 'last', 'year', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'played', 'snotty', 'cheerleader', 'performance', 'was', 'forgettable', 'one', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'oh', 'even', 'beautiful', 'makeup', 'Give', 'girl', 'starring', 'role', 'think', 'something.Shane', 'West', 'great', 'too', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'two', 'together', 'make', 'beautiful', 'couple', 'even', 'ending', 'not', 'original', 'been', 'done', 'few', 'movies', 'will', 'make', 'weep', 'baby', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'smile', 'film', 'rare', 'gem', 'teen', 'movie', 'really', ""n't"", 'teen', 'movie', 'sappy', 'chick', 'flick', 'really', ""n't"", 'really', 'sappy', 'chick', 'flick', 'Overall', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'bad', 'times', 'PG', 'rating', 'almost', 'profanity', 'sex-free', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'time', 'younger', 'society', 'thrive', 'gross-out', 'humor', 'American', 'Pie', 'should', 'look', 'up', 'Landon', 'Jamie', 'should', 'hope', 'pray', 'can', 'find', 'love', 'theirs']",N/A

591334,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B00005JKVZ,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 2]","There really are no spoilers with a Nicholas Sparks film, but I'll yell SPOILERS now in case you, for some strange reason, don't already know how this ends.Nicholas Sparks is one of those cultural phenomenons that I just don't get.  I mean, the man basically writes the same story over and over, changing the names and occasionally the dates and then randomly inserting a different disease or horrific accident here and there (sometimes not even that).  I don't see the fascination with his material because he offers nothing new, ever.  And yet, the man is rich beyond belief because his writing is consistently devoured by middle-aged white women who desperately cling to his faux love stories for emotionally medicinal purposes.  Films are made from his books on a yearly basis (sometimes two or three times a year, considering that he churns out regurgitated fare at a monthly basis almost) and they rake in the dough since they star the latest pair of hot young things to hit the cinematic circuit.  In 2002, before the world went overboard with Sparks, Mandy Moore and Shane West took their places in the adaptation of `A Walk to Remember', the formulaic story of a rebellious `popular' boy who is forced to spend time with the quiet, nerdy, unpopular girl.  They fall in love, obviously...and then she dies.Seriously, we all knew that was coming.One thing that sets this apart from most other films in this genre is that the acting is so pure.  Both Mandy Moore and Shane West deliver performances that feel natural and expected and just beautifully in tune with one another.  The way that Adam Shankman directs these young actors is with simple grace, and while that can at times come across rather boring on screen, it doesn't here.  Like some have already mentioned, there is something appealing about showcasing characters who are respectable and admirable.The film goes where it's expected to, so it's one that you've seen before you've seen it, but it works well for what it is.  Moore is terrific here, and when she uses her pipes (when she sings `Only Hope') she really soars.  This may be typical Sparks fare, but this is one of the best adaptations of his work.I still don't `get him' though.",4,Better than it should have been...,1318809600,"10 17, 2011",2011,2209,"['really', 'are', 'spoilers', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'film', ""'ll"", 'yell', 'SPOILERS', 'now', 'case', 'strange', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'how', 'ends.Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'one', 'cultural', 'phenomenons', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'mean', 'man', 'basically', 'same', 'story', 'changing', 'names', 'occasionally', 'dates', 'then', 'randomly', 'inserting', 'different', 'disease', 'horrific', 'accident', 'here', 'there', 'sometimes', 'not', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'fascination', 'material', 'nothing', 'new', 'ever', 'yet', 'man', 'rich', 'belief', 'writing', 'consistently', 'devoured', 'middle-aged', 'white', 'women', 'who', 'desperately', 'cling', 'faux', 'love', 'stories', 'emotionally', 'medicinal', 'purposes', 'Films', 'are', 'made', 'books', 'yearly', 'basis', 'sometimes', 'two', 'three', 'times', 'year', 'considering', 'out', 'regurgitated', 'fare', 'monthly', 'basis', 'almost', 'rake', 'dough', 'star', 'latest', 'pair', 'hot', 'young', 'things', 'hit', 'cinematic', 'circuit', '2002', 'world', 'went', 'Sparks', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Shane', 'West', 'took', 'places', 'adaptation', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'formulaic', 'story', 'rebellious', 'popular', 'boy', 'who', 'forced', 'spend', 'time', 'quiet', 'nerdy', 'unpopular', 'girl', 'fall', 'love', 'obviously', 'then', 'dies.Seriously', 'knew', 'was', 'coming.One', 'thing', 'apart', 'most', 'other', 'films', 'genre', 'acting', 'so', 'pure', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Shane', 'West', 'deliver', 'performances', 'feel', 'natural', 'expected', 'just', 'beautifully', 'tune', 'one', 'way', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'young', 'actors', 'simple', 'grace', 'can', 'times', 'come', 'rather', 'boring', 'screen', ""n't"", 'here', 'have', 'already', 'mentioned', 'something', 'appealing', 'showcasing', 'characters', 'who', 'are', 'respectable', 'admirable.The', 'film', 'where', 'expected', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'well', 'what', 'Moore', 'terrific', 'here', 'when', 'pipes', 'when', 'sings', 'Only', 'Hope', 'really', 'may', 'be', 'typical', 'Sparks', 'fare', 'one', 'best', 'adaptations', 'work.I', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'get']",N/A
591335,A295YBJ2KROL8Q,B00005JKVZ,Andrew Shih,"[7, 8]","It is hard to make a PG-rated romance, because you can't simply use sex scenes to show the feelings which the couple has for each other and to imply the degree of intimacy in the relationship.  You can't paint with such broad strokes.  Instead, you must use a narrower brush to depict all the small but significant things which bring the two closer together.  It is also hard to make a movie reflecting traditional Christian values, especially a romance, and yet appeal to a wide audience.  It is problematic to communicate beliefs without being preachy, the only solution being to show through examples rather than to tell through sermons.  A Walk to Remember succeeds in both endeavors and is in my opinion both the best PG-rated romance as well as the closest thing to a Christian film (in mainstream media) in recent memory.  It is truly a breakthrough event.The characters are well-developed, the acting is superb (this is pop singer Mandy Moore's debut BTW), the pacing and picture is perfect, and the soundtrack is great.  But it's the story based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks which will be most remembered.  A note to prospective viewers who may have some misconceptions concerning this film:  This is not a superficial teen romance, nor is it a feel-good romantic comedy.  It is a romance in the classical sense of the word, a serious exploration of the emotional journey experienced by two young people who are truly and deeply in love.Although the stereotypical target audience for this movie may consist of teenage girls from the Bible belt, I am none of the above.  For starters, I am a guy who is not generally into ""chick flicks.""  Of the DVD's in my top twenty collection, only two or three could qualify as such while the rest consist of such ""manly fare"" as ""The Matrix,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""A Better Tomorrow II.""  Additionally, although I am a Christian, I generally stay away from so-called ""Christian music"" and ""Christian movies"" because frankly much of it ... and I suspect that the reason it is labelled or marketted as such is to get people to buy it just because it's ""Christian.""  I like to consider myself as having some independence and objectivity in my assessment of artistic merit.

I was with my Grandfather in the Ramada Suites and I was flipping the channels for a good movie to watch. I looked at the TV Guide and saw that &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; was on. Now previously my friend Maddie had recommended it to me, during a discussion in English class. Now I usually dont like to watch a movie before I read the book, but I had no time to decide. I just flipped to the channel and began to watch.I began the movie about fifteen minutes in and well from what I gathered there was a cocky badass jock (Shane West) and a pure and good hearted christian girl (Mandy Moore) From what it looked Shane was tired of the same old hotties and preppy girls and was looking for a pure relationship. But then he met a girl (Mandy Moore) and at first Shane West really doesn't think that much of her but as time goes on he begins to like her, but it's the opposite for her she thinks he is a very nice guy who could be a friend but as time goes on she see's him as a little full of himself.Shane West and Mandy Moore star in a play one night where they both share a kiss, where they both realize that they are destined for each other (they dont admit it but they know it) Then when Shane West asks Mandy Moore out, her father who is the Pastor of a church doesn't allow her to date (very typical) But when Shane West asks for permission he changes his mind. As time goes on the couple date and have a few controversial episodes together, but of course they work them out. When it all comes to, Mandy Moore and Shane West get married, but there is one problem. A month before the wedding Mandy Moore confesses that she had been diagnosed with cancer. So, the ending is very sad.I liked this movie because although its typical it is very good. I recommend it to everyone that wants to watch it.

591348,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005JKVZ,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 5]","I've been told that 'A Walk to Remember' should be forgiven for its multitude of faults because a)It has a positive Christian message for teens, and b)It's a 'Chick Flick', and, for some reason, that makes leaps of logic somehow acceptable. Personally, both arguments, to me, demean the groups referred to. A good film stands on its own merits; a bad film, and this one is a stinker, should not be rationalized away by saying it's target audience expects less!'A Walk to Remember' opens with the world's most clean-cut 'gang' of overprivledged kids busting into an abandoned warehouse complex at night (shades of 'Footloose'), then daring a kid as a rite of initiation to dive from a tower into a sinkhole of water (shades of 'Breaking Away'). Conned by the charismatic leader (Shane West), the kid jumps, and is badly injured. Naturally, the police immediately arrive, and West is busted, for staying with the kid. As punishment, he is given probation, community service time...and he has to JOIN the DRAMA CLUB!!! (This is PUNISHMENT for nearing KILLING a kid???) In the Drama Club is school geek and Born-Again Christian Mandy Moore, who you can tell is 'The Good Girl' because she carries a Bible, doesn't wear makeup, and is wardrobe-challenged! From her soulful glances at him, and his arrogant smile in reply, you know that True Love is only a few plot-twists away. It takes Opening Night to provide the catalyst, though...apparently, this club doesn't believe in dress rehearsals, because when she walks onstage, in makeup, and a slinky dress with no underwear (one wonders how her minister father approved of THAT!), and sings to West, as the male lead (yes, despite having no acting ability, or experience, he gets the lead in the play), he sees how hot she is for the first time, and falls for her.She warns him NOT to fall in love with her (ah, could there be a secret she's not sharing? DUH!), but he follows her around, anyway, even to the cemetery where she stargazes with her telescope at night. (This sets up one of the most brain-dead scenes of the film; he asks to see Pluto, to which she replies that it doesn't rise until two hours before sunrise. ""I'll wait"", he says...In reality, Pluto is impossible to see in a small telescope...it wasn't even discovered until 1930, in an amazing piece of detective work...and this supposedly brilliant astronomy hobbyist doesn't know this??? As a Born-Again Christian, you KNOW she wasn't fibbing to get a night alone with West...or was she?)Eventually, Moore collapses, and it is revealed she is dying of cancer (shades of 'Here on Earth'), and, on her deathbed in the hospital, West proposes to her. His estranged doctor father pays to get her Home Care, for her last days...and the next scene, the couple are walking through the woods together, with Moore looking better than ever! (I believe in Love's healing powers, but this is a stretch, even for me!) The couple marry, and share a Summer of Love, before she finally dies (shades of 'Love Story'), and he, redeemed, goes on to ace Medical School (shades of 'Magnificent Obsession').The acting is uneven, at best; Shane West does a credible job, certainly better than Chris Klein did in the 'Walk' clone, 'Here on Earth'. Peter Coyote, as Moore's minister father, does what he can in a role that seems to have been 'lifted' from John Lithgow's in 'Footloose'. Daryl Hannah, nearly unrecognizable with dark hair, is quite good as West's mother. But the rave reviews Mandy Moore has received as the dying girl seem unjustified; no makeup and stilted line readings do NOT equal a great performance! In order for a film like this to work, you must believe the heroine, and the bittersweet nature of her love.

If you can remember that far back, when you fall in love as a teenager it's a crystal pure love with a lot less complications.  The two actors of the movie capture that so well which I believe is one of the successes of this film.Shane West - I'm now a fan.  I have not heard of this actor before, but his portrayal of Landon and his tranformation from a bad boy to a boy in love is satisfyingly accurate.  Mandy Moore - a rare breed in Hollywood - beautiful and sexy with a wholesome image.  I was aware that she received a lot of credit as an actress in this movie (which was one of the reasons why I wanted to see the film) but I was surprised at how she was able to carry the film with such ease.Honestly, I am not a fan of Nicholas Sparks - his novels or adapted films.  I am not going to say that this one was an exception.  The movie still had sappy lines, unrealistic plot, and unconvincing elements to it.  But I give it five stars for successfully sucking me, a non-Sparks fan, into the movie.

591367,APXZRLC8LO165,B00005JKVZ,Carly,"[0, 0]","Yes, I love this movie. I love the acting, the sincere storyline, and the courageous separation from the typical teen movie formula. In today's world, this is exactly what people need to watch, especially young people. And it was released in theaters just a few short months after September 11; a better time could not have been picked.It is a simple yet beautiful plot that takes a risk and goes straight to your heart, even through its own cliches: Landon Carter, the big shot high school senior hangs out with the wrong people, gets into trouble, and eventually falls for Jamie Sullivan, the purehearted, sweet, beautiful, and talented daughter of the local minister. When they take the time to truly go that extra mile and understand each other, the uncertain friendship forms into the kind of loving and trusting bond that all of us dream about. They would do anything for each other; they're happy together. Oh, but there's a catch. There always is. They form a relationship that not even tragedy can break....and that is certainly proven by the end of the film.This is the kind of romantic plot that too many teen movies push down into darkness with sex, drugs, and drinking. The media has done this so much that some of us actually forget that Landon and Jamie's love is not all that unrealistic. I think this is why so many critics out there are not even looking at this movie the way it should be; Landon and Jamie are role models to admire, and if you are willing to overlook the beauty and innocence of this film and dismiss it as a corny and unrealistic view of teenage romance, then you need to sit down and look again.I am inspired by the love story presented in ""A Walk to Remember."" I used to watch it and be lost in any attempt I could ever make in finding something wrong with it. After seeing it for at LEAST 15 times now (no joke), I will admit that it could have been made a little more realistic if the film was longer. Yes, many of us agree that this is a tearjerker of a romance between the two main characters, but doesn't it all happen just a little too fast? One minute, Landon is looking at Jamie in a totally discriminating light, laughing at her and assisting in making her the butt of jokes; then, all of a sudden, he's punching his best friend in the face for her. I have noticed that even when Landon was caught in the bad crowd, he seemed to be somewhat distant and not as bad as you think he is; still, I think the movie needed a little something more to make Landon's transformation a little more convincing.Then you've got the school situation. I'd love to see a school like the one in this movie in real life. A huge fight goes on in the lunchroom....and it seems that there are no teachers or adults around to break it up. Twice, Landon and Jamie jump in their cars and leave during school hours. This is an aspect of the film that always bugs me....they needed to focus on that a little  more to help the whole movie make sense.However, these are only minor setbacks that many of us are willing to look past because the loving and outstanding love story makes it all worthwhile. Mandy Moore and Shane West have VERY difficult roles to play, and they pull it off well. They have excellent chemistry, and not all on-screen couples do. It's a great movie that certainly deserved a better DVD--the commentaries were awesome, but what about all the deleted scenes? Apparently, there was a pretty good handful of those.... I would have loved to see them. Regardless, this movie just isn't one to ignore; buy it, rent it, do whatever you need to do to see it. You don't have to like it, but we can all at least walk away with a positive lesson from it.",4,"a beautiful, beautiful movie, but....",1040083200,"12 17, 2002",2002,3686,"['Yes', 'love', 'movie', 'love', 'acting', 'sincere', 'storyline', 'courageous', 'separation', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'formula', 'today', 'world', 'exactly', 'what', 'people', 'need', 'watch', 'especially', 'young', 'people', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'just', 'few', 'short', 'months', 'September', '11', 'better', 'time', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'picked.It', 'simple', 'yet', 'beautiful', 'plot', 'risk', 'straight', 'heart', 'even', 'own', 'cliches', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'big', 'shot', 'high', 'school', 'senior', 'hangs', 'out', 'wrong', 'people', 'trouble', 'eventually', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'purehearted', 'sweet', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'daughter', 'local', 'minister', 'When', 'take', 'time', 'truly', 'go', 'extra', 'mile', 'understand', 'other', 'uncertain', 'friendship', 'forms', 'kind', 'loving', 'trusting', 'bond', 'dream', 'would', 'do', 'anything', 'other', ""'re"", 'happy', 'together', 'Oh', 'catch', 'always', 'form', 'relationship', 'not', 'even', 'tragedy', 'can', 'break', '.and', 'certainly', 'proven', 'end', 'film.This', 'kind', 'romantic', 'plot', 'too', 'many', 'teen', 'movies', 'push', 'down', 'darkness', 'sex', 'drugs', 'drinking', 'media', 'done', 'so', 'much', 'actually', 'forget', 'Landon', 'Jamie', 'love', 'not', 'unrealistic', 'think', 'why', 'so', 'many', 'critics', 'are', 'not', 'even', 'looking', 'movie', 'way', 'should', 'be', 'Landon', 'Jamie', 'are', 'role', 'models', 'admire', 'are', 'willing', 'overlook', 'beauty', 'innocence', 'film', 'dismiss', 'corny', 'unrealistic', 'view', 'teenage', 'romance', 'then', 'need', 'sit', 'down', 'look', 'again.I', 'am', 'inspired', 'love', 'story', 'presented', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'used', 'watch', 'be', 'lost', 'attempt', 'could', 'ever', 'make', 'finding', 'something', 'wrong', 'seeing', 'LEAST', '15', 'times', 'now', 'joke', 'will', 'admit', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'little', 'more', 'realistic', 'film', 'was', 'longer', 'Yes', 'many', 'agree', 'tearjerker', 'romance', 'two', 'main', 'characters', ""n't"", 'happen', 'just', 'little', 'too', 'fast', 'One', 'minute', 'Landon', 'looking', 'Jamie', 'totally', 'discriminating', 'light', 'laughing', 'assisting', 'making', 'butt', 'jokes', 'then', 'sudden', 'punching', 'best', 'friend', 'face', 'have', 'noticed', 'even', 'when', 'Landon', 'was', 'caught', 'bad', 'crowd', 'seemed', 'be', 'somewhat', 'distant', 'not', 'as', 'bad', 'think', 'still', 'think', 'movie', 'needed', 'little', 'something', 'more', 'make', 'Landon', 'transformation', 'little', 'more', 'convincing.Then', ""'ve"", 'got', 'school', 'situation', ""'d"", 'love', 'see', 'school', 'one', 'movie', 'real', 'life', 'huge', 'fight', 'lunchroom', '.and', 'are', 'teachers', 'adults', 'break', 'up', 'Twice', 'Landon', 'Jamie', 'jump', 'cars', 'leave', 'school', 'hours', 'aspect', 'film', 'always', 'bugs', '.they', 'needed', 'focus', 'little', 'more', 'help', 'whole', 'movie', 'make', 'sense.However', 'are', 'only', 'minor', 'setbacks', 'many', 'are', 'willing', 'look', 'past', 'loving', 'outstanding', 'love', 'story', 'worthwhile', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Shane', 'West', 'have', 'VERY', 'difficult', 'roles', 'play', 'pull', 'off', 'well', 'have', 'excellent', 'chemistry', 'not', 'on-screen', 'couples', 'do', 'great', 'movie', 'certainly', 'deserved', 'better', 'DVD', 'commentaries', 'were', 'awesome', 'what', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Apparently', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'handful', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'Regardless', 'movie', 'just', ""n't"", 'one', 'ignore', 'buy', 'rent', 'do', 'need', 'do', 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'like', 'can', 'least', 'walk', 'away', 'positive', 'lesson']",N/A

It offers no special effects, no big named Hollywood celebrities and didn't cost alot of money to make. Yet those facts which might make one hesitate to watch the film is the very thing that makes this movie such a winner. Singer Mandy Moore stars as Jamie, a young girl who's confident in her own simplicity yet is teased by the popular kids in school. Landon, played by Shane West, is one of the popular kids who gets himself in trouble and needs Jamie's assistance to help him with the school play he must be in or he'll get thrown out of school. Opening his eyes to a different world, Landon begins to see that everything he knew before he met Jamie doesn't matter anymore and true beauty lies deep within the heart. All very predictable and drowning in sappiness, this movie was such a hit due to it's irresistible charms and like Moore's character Jamie, it's confidence and well awareness of how important it is in today's society not to lose your morals and not to lose yourself when others want you to change. It's very well acted with a light story that will tug on your heart a time or two and this is one walk you will remember for quite some time.

591374,A3K8POFWCQI2GS,B00005JKVZ,Char,"[1, 1]","Focusing eventually on the relationship between two teens who have the courage to stand out among their peers, this story opens onto the scene of a typical late-night daring teen adventure which ends in tragedy.  The scene sets the movie's theme which pertains to the antithesis of true friendship and love--relationships of supposed ""friendship"" that take place in the midst of cruel mockery in a crowd that sets itself up in brutal superiority.  These contemporary young people live a life based on almost incredible (to me) unkindness and treachery.  But the story is about how true love and friendship do grow into fruition, chiefly because of the courage of one person of strong faith.So this is a movie about going through really just the usual PAIN that many young people experience during the teen school years.  Although the story isn't about the phenomenon of bullying in schools, it could be viewed in the context of  a concern about bullying.  At this point in life where they have begun the growth process of becoming mature adults, the major characters live in imperfect, non-ideal situations of family life.  Their parents are going through some of the emotional struggles of typical modern adulthood.I found the early scenes about ugly teen behavior and the raucous teen music that pervaded them hard to stomach, but the rough music was relieved by moments of more harmonious music that promised better things to come.  Although repulsed during maybe the first third of the movie, I ""hung in there.""  And was glad that I did because the story turned out to be about a beautiful awakening to true love, capable of bearing sacrifice.  And despite unhappiness and imperfect circumstances in the characters' lives, the story conveyed a very enCOURAGing, STRENGTHening message about  love and life.Even though the movie was put out by Warner Bros. in 2002, obvious references to Christian love were inextricably woven into the story.  This is definitely and deliberately a movie that upholds Christian ideals of love.  It's excellent and deeply affective although it contains some heart-break and unpleasantness (as expressed in the unkindness of the teens).  I found the VHS tape in a rummage sale and had never heard of this movie or the actors in it, but, from the brief summary of its plot on the cover, it sounded interesting and I took it home.I see from the numbers of reviews, nearly a thousand (!), that this was a very popular and well-loved movie despite the Christian content.  (Maybe movie-makers should take that ""message"" into great consideration.)  For anyone who likes Christian references in a story, or who at least tolerates them well, this is a really good movie.  (Just keep your volume control handy and turn down any music you find unbearable.)  I highly recommend this as a good and edifying movie for the moments when you want to relax but with some meaningful and uplifting content in your entertainment.  (You will probably cry during the last scenes.)This movie would be interesting and suitable for teenagers and adults.",5,"Vicious teen peerage, one person's courage to be different, fruition of real friendship and love.",1366329600,"04 19, 2013",2013,3061,"['Focusing', 'eventually', 'relationship', 'two', 'teens', 'who', 'have', 'courage', 'stand', 'out', 'peers', 'story', 'scene', 'typical', 'late-night', 'daring', 'teen', 'adventure', 'tragedy', 'scene', 'movie', 'theme', 'antithesis', 'true', 'friendship', 'love', 'relationships', 'supposed', 'friendship', 'take', 'place', 'midst', 'cruel', 'mockery', 'crowd', 'up', 'brutal', 'superiority', 'contemporary', 'young', 'people', 'live', 'life', 'based', 'almost', 'incredible', 'unkindness', 'treachery', 'story', 'how', 'true', 'love', 'friendship', 'do', 'grow', 'fruition', 'chiefly', 'courage', 'one', 'person', 'strong', 'faith.So', 'movie', 'going', 'really', 'just', 'usual', 'PAIN', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'experience', 'teen', 'school', 'years', 'story', ""n't"", 'phenomenon', 'bullying', 'schools', 'could', 'be', 'viewed', 'context', 'concern', 'bullying', 'point', 'life', 'where', 'have', 'begun', 'growth', 'process', 'becoming', 'mature', 'adults', 'major', 'characters', 'live', 'imperfect', 'non-ideal', 'situations', 'family', 'life', 'parents', 'are', 'going', 'emotional', 'struggles', 'typical', 'modern', 'adulthood.I', 'found', 'early', 'scenes', 'ugly', 'teen', 'behavior', 'raucous', 'teen', 'music', 'pervaded', 'hard', 'stomach', 'rough', 'music', 'was', 'relieved', 'moments', 'more', 'harmonious', 'music', 'promised', 'better', 'things', 'come', 'repulsed', 'maybe', 'first', 'third', 'movie', 'hung', 'there', 'was', 'glad', 'did', 'story', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'beautiful', 'awakening', 'true', 'love', 'capable', 'bearing', 'sacrifice', 'unhappiness', 'imperfect', 'circumstances', 'characters', 'lives', 'story', 'conveyed', 'very', 'enCOURAGing', 'STRENGTHening', 'message', 'love', 'life.Even', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'out', 'Warner', 'Bros.', '2002', 'obvious', 'references', 'Christian', 'love', 'were', 'inextricably', 'woven', 'story', 'definitely', 'deliberately', 'movie', 'Christian', 'ideals', 'love', 'excellent', 'deeply', 'affective', 'heart-break', 'unpleasantness', 'expressed', 'unkindness', 'teens', 'found', 'VHS', 'tape', 'rummage', 'sale', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'movie', 'actors', 'brief', 'summary', 'plot', 'cover', 'sounded', 'interesting', 'took', 'home.I', 'see', 'numbers', 'reviews', 'nearly', 'thousand', 'was', 'very', 'popular', 'well-loved', 'movie', 'Christian', 'content', 'Maybe', 'movie-makers', 'should', 'take', 'message', 'great', 'consideration', 'anyone', 'who', 'Christian', 'references', 'story', 'who', 'least', 'tolerates', 'well', 'really', 'good', 'movie', 'Just', 'keep', 'volume', 'control', 'handy', 'turn', 'down', 'music', 'find', 'unbearable', 'highly', 'recommend', 'good', 'edifying', 'movie', 'moments', 'when', 'want', 'relax', 'meaningful', 'uplifting', 'content', 'entertainment', 'will', 'probably', 'cry', 'last', 'scenes', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'suitable', 'teenagers', 'adults']",N/A
591375,AB34G6VKP28L,B00005JKVZ,"Charity Bishop ""Film Fanatic""","[6, 7]","I know a lot of people pick on this film merely because it's not the usual lame sex-obsessed crude-joke-filled and corny trash that is constantly fed into the minds of teenagers. But actually, ""A Walk to Remember"" is a great film beyond its acceptability for most audiences -- Christian or secular. The reasons why this film are so special is that love is treated in the way that it should be... a willingness to love even if you know that you will be hurt. When it first came out, I had no interest in seeing it... but I went along to a showing and was captivated. I didn't know Hollywood had the intelligence to make this kind of movie any longer!By now everyone knows the plot... it's about a wild child, Landon Carter, who gets into trouble for endangering the life of another student and drinking on school grounds. He's turned over to the principle, who informs him he must tutor underprivileged children on weekends, help the janitor after school, and participate in the annual spring play. Reluctantly, Landon accepts his punishment and is thrown in with a group of hopeful thespians, the most memorable of which being Jamie Sullivan, the local Bible-carrying minister's daughter. Since Landon is terrible at acting, and Jamie seems to have it altogether, he asks for help, despite her father's loathing of him.The two go through the ups and downs of attraction, and that's when  it really gets good, on an emotional level as well as visually. I loved seeing the changes in not only Landon, but Jamie as well. Landon becomes entirely unselfish and giving of himself... his soul desire through the last half is to make Jamie happy. It's a lesson in agape love that everyone needs. (I had at least two of my guy friends see this and totally get a new perspective on how they should treat their girlfriends.) And Jamie loosens up... she even wears a pair of jeans at one point and leaves her hair down. The scene in the middle of the highway will bring tears of joy to your eyes, since it's such an emotional ""wow"" that someone could do something so loving for you.The music is also great, particularly the ""Only Hope"" sequence sung by Jamie (Mandy Moore) in the school play. That has to be one of the most gorgeous musical cuts I've ever seen on film... the images become a part of the music. I also appreciate the respect for Christianity shown by the characters; Jamie's father, the pastor, as well as Jamie herself, help break out of that stereotyped gay-loathing, Bible-hugging ""religious"" people mentality. It's a beautiful film, a gorgeous screenplay (the dialogue is so meaningful it's amazing) and tackles an emotional high with just the right level of good humor. I've reccomended it to all of my friends, and I would to you, as well.On the DVD:The picture and sound quality are beautiful; the textures and colors blend seamlessly to create something lovely to look at. The director's gorgeous cinematography is well-used in this edition, which is sadly under-pushed and without goodies. I would have appreciated a featurette or two, although there are two full-length commentaries, Mandy Moore's ""Cry"" music video, and a trailer. I didn't particularly like some of the comments made by the director on his commentary, which reference a raunchier version originally planned, and talks about some of the ways in which they knocked it from the targeted PG13 to a PG rating. (Why did I have to know that? Why can't I just respect him for making a clean teen flick?)

It is a film based on the bestselling book by Nicholas Sparks, and is about two very different teenagers who unexpectedly fall in love. Landon Carter (Shane West) is your typical ""bad-boy-next-door"". He's popular and has a lot of friends. But when he gets into trouble one too many times, Landon's high school principal makes him participate in the school play and help tutor children with learning disabilities on the weekends. On the other hand, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) is the sweet, kind, religious girl who lives with her widowed minster father and is always being made fun of by her classmates. Landon and Jamie had known each other all their lives, but Landon doesn't expect to fall in love with her during the school play's opening night. It takes a little while, but their love soon begins to blossom. As Landon is starting to learn about love, life, and himself, Jamie confesses a secret she's been keeping from him that might destroy their relationship forever.The film was simply moving and touching. West and Moore have amazing on-screen chemistry and their talents really shine. The supporting cast was also excellent. There is a wonderful storyline and smart dialouge. Hardly any violence, very mild language, and no sex makes this viewable to basically all ages. The DVD is all right, but it could have add a few more extras. It only includes 2 commentaries (one by the director, and one by West and Moore) and Mandy Moore's music video, ""Cry"". The DVD is available in widescreen format.

I was with my Grandfather in the Ramada Suites and I was flipping the channels for a good movie to watch. I looked at the TV Guide and saw that ""A Walk to Remember"" was on. Now previously my friend Maddie had recommended it to me, during a discussion in English class. Now I usually dont like to watch a movie before I read the book, but I had no time to decide. I just flipped to the channel and began to watch.I began the movie about fifteen minutes in and well from what I gathered there was a cocky badass jock (Shane West) and a pure and good hearted christian girl (Mandy Moore) From what it looked Shane was tired of the same old  hotties and preppy girls and was looking for a pure relationship. But then he met a girl (Mandy Moore) and at first Shane West really doesn't think that much of her but as time goes on he begins to like her, but it's the opposite for her she thinks he is a very nice guy who could be a friend but as time goes on she see's him as a little full of himself.Shane West and Mandy Moore star in a play one night where they both share a kiss, where they both realize that they are destined for each other (they dont admit it but they know it) Then when Shane West asks Mandy Moore out, her father  who is the Pastor of a church doesn't allow her to date (very typical) But when Shane West asks for permission he changes his mind. As time goes on the couple date and have a few controversial episodes together, but of course they work them out. When it all comes to, Mandy Moore and Shane West get married, but there is one problem. A month before the wedding Mandy Moore confesses that she had been diagnosed with cancer. So, the ending is very sad.I liked this movie because although its typical it is very good. I recommend it to everyone that wants to watch it.

But as usual I had doubts about the movie released upon the same name staring Shane West and Mandy Moore. Landon Carter (West) is the popular high school bad boy. He is punished after commiting a dangerous stunt and forced to join the school play and comes upon Jamie Sullivan (Moore) the girl who has been in all of his classes for years and has been the target of pranks and put-downs for much of her life. She is also the local preacher's (Peter Coyote) daughter. At first, he is resentful of her coming up to him, but he soon finds himself asking her for help with his lines in the play.Landon soon falls hopelessly in love with Jamie (don't blame him), something he thought impossible. As you watch their relationship blossom throughout the movie, your own feelings are inextricably linked and you find yourself cheering the couple on, marveling at their sweet times spent together and secretly envious of the intense love that they have discovered. Jamie is so incredibly pure and unselfish that she had my heart fluttering by the end of the movie.The movie benefits greatly from its two talented leads, Moore and West, who prove their acting worth with great performances. Moore lends her character a huge amount of depth and surrounds her with an innocent, heartwarming aura, so much so that by the end of the movie, she can do no wrong.

In ""A Walk to Remember"", Shane West stars as your typical high school teenage bad boy, Landon Carter, with very low expectations for his life and future, and a troubled family situation. Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, who is just the opposite. She is the daughter of the town's minister. Very religious, sweet, and always kind to everybody. When Landon gets busted drinking, his school principal forces him into participating in the school play...the same play Jamie is in. During the performance, Landon falls for Jamie, and tries to get Jamie to go out with him. As their love blossoms, Jamie finally confesses her true feelings for Landon, but she also has a terrible secret that could ruin their relationship forever.Mandy Moore and Shane West have amazing chemistry, and that's really what pulls the film together. Superb acting from the entire cast, and a great storyline. There is no sex in this film and very mild language and violence, so it is a fine movie to see by the entire family.

591388,A169I83JL8QJGN,B00005JKVZ,Daniel A Moir,"[7, 8]","I am probably the biggest anti-teen movie critic out there. From American Pie, to Scary Movie, to the horrid She's all that, I hate teen movies, usually because they try to be cute, and funny when they're really not. It's amazing to think that I was 18 only four years ago, and four years ago I probably would have had a completely different out look on teen movies. It is with the anti-teen movie mindset that I set out to avoid this movie like a plague despite my sisters begging me to see it.Now that it came to DVD, and my sister wanted me to see it so bad she bought it just so I could see it I felt obligated to watch this movie. To be honest I'm pretty hard to get emotional with a movie, but this film nearly succeeded in making me cry. It was so very good that I've picked up my own copy, the first ever-teen movie to be added to my 200 plus DVD collection, and thus somewhat of a milestone for me.Although the film does follow some stereotypes of a romance story I noticed the ""jerk goes nice guy"" but was the only stereotypical element of this story, and even though Landen (West) was a complete jerk at first he was still somewhat likeable. Me? I would have been Chasing Jamie (Subtle movie reference, sorry) from the get go because she was a very loveable character from the beginning. Normal, not a super model like what is normal of romance films, just a cute girl next-door type.Another aspect of this film that I liked is its refusal to divulge into inappropriate content. Jamie (Moore) starts the movie out as a faithful religious girl and ends the movie the same way, unlike other films I've seen, many of which featuring the exact opposite of this character, the ""good girl gone bad"" routine is tiresome, but nowhere in this film.Language is clean, characters down to earth and normal, with everything about this story seeming much more realistic, and much less superficial than many romance movies I have suffered through. I'm not a fan of romance movies as they are often formulaic, and stale, but this was definitely a huge breath of fresh air to the genre, as it is definitely a beautiful movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family. Plus it's made a Mandy fan of me.

591392,A31LHED3SKLWVB,B00005JKVZ,Darren,"[1, 2]","Ultimate girls' fantasy about taming the Boy from the Wrong Side of the Tracks ... except that Shane West isn't really from the wrong side of the tracks or anywhere near any tracks, actually.  As in all of Nicholas Sparks' fictions, everyone lives in genteel small-city/large-town America and is quite well-to-do.  Our hero starts off playing stupid practical jokes on people and getting them hurt, and ends up becoming a saint thanks to Mandy Moore, who plays the daughter of the widowed town reverend (Peter Coyote, really slumming it here).  She's deeply Christian, which is the only interesting thing about her, considering that almost all lead characters in mainstream movie fare are non-demoninational and yet not even atheist.  Her hobbies are astrology (to counter the Christian thing, perhaps?) and singing in a bland R&B; style like a modern diva.  She wears sweaters borrowed from the Little House on the Prairie props department.  She's not allowed to date boys.  In the first hour it all seems like &#34;Footloose&#34; -- one expects Coyote to bark from his pulpit, &#34;NO DANCING ALLOWED!&#34;  But I won't go into the particulars of the plot, because there's a Big Reveal at the end of the second act which you should see coming a mile away.  Put it this way: if you're old enough to remember &#34;Love Story&#34;, you'll know what happens.Sometimes I'm surprised by a movie, which is a really cool thing, so I gave this a chance because it has been sitting free on Prime for some time, and I do recall some generally positive reviews for it from critics.  I cannot think why.  Unless you're the target demographic, and I'm not sure precisely who that might be, as it's not really fun enough for kids and it's a little *too much* for the older set (or it should be), I think you'll be embarrassed by its shameless heart-tugging and tear-jerking.  But a demographic there most definitely is for Mr. Sparks, whomever they are out there: his books sell by the millions and several of them have been made into glossy motion pictures.  At least this one is about teenagers, thus making Sparks' gooey earnestness somewhat easier to take.  First love is by definition gooey and earnest.  Problem is, Sparks seems to apply these adolescent fantasies about noble suffering in love to all his characters and situations, and in my opinion it doesn't wear very well on people in middle-age, like, say, Kevin Costner and Robin Wright.  Frankly, I'm not sure it wears so well on the kids here, either.  Shane West is a fantasy construct, and is never believable, both when he's a &#34;bad boy&#34; and when he later becomes the Most Perfect Boy Ever.  Regardless of the manifestation, West applies the same formula throughout: he preens, he pouts, he frowns, he occasionally cries.  What he doesn't do is convince us that he's a young man going through a major transition.  He makes Moore look like Meryl Streep by comparison.  Speaking of Moore, her character is also a fantasy construct of a writer who must have spent a great deal of time in his own adolescence building the Perfect Girl in own doubtlessly overactive imagination, an imagination that has nonetheless paid off for him in silver dollars.

591410,A15TNUM2PBS6F0,B00005JKVZ,"Ei ""crzybookmoovielover""","[2, 5]","I read the book, &quot;A Walk to remember&quot; by Nicholas Sparks, and I really liked the story and how it's main character, Landon Carter, evolved. It was a story of redemption and undying love. The overall message to it is: It is what inside that counts. We can all learn from this that people can really have an effect on what kind of person we really want to be deep down.The movie has kept up the part of the story between Landon and Jamie Sullivan, the girl he falls for. However, I was not at all pleased with the fact that they had made it a modern day story when it was set in the 1950's in the book, and Landon narrated it from the present.  It was like he was looking back at his life, and replaying those most important momments.  It was a quality the book had that kept the story and it's meaning so true to life.  We all often look back at past relationships and experiences that helped shape who we have turned out to be.The movie totally disregarded that whole part, and that awful soundtrack of &quot;movie rock songs&quot; doesn't help my opinion.  The only song that had any meaning was the song that Jamie sang to Landon in the play.It was perfectly clear to me that this movie just used the book as a springboard for a new teen movie.  I have no idea who Shane West is, and I didn't think there was anything special about him. When I pictured Landon in the book, he was nothing like this guy. He just appeared to be another cast member of Dawson's creek.Mandy Moore, who played Jamie, was okay. She is the latest of the pop singers to grace the silver screen, and she didn't do much better than any of those who came before her.  She wasn't the worse actress, but like West, I didn't feel anything special about her performance.The best acting was by Darryl Hannah as Landon's mom, and Peter Coyote, as Jamie's father who is the reverend in the small North Carolina town they live in.  They were both very believable.The scenery was beautiful. I know the story is set in N. Carolina, but I don't know that it was actually filmed there.If you just see the movie and skip the book, maybe you will better off than me. I tend to compare movie to book. The book is always so much better because you get to know the characters so much better. If you don't have time for the book, but like romantic films, this is an okay diversion from reality.  It is not one of the best, but if you are under the age of 18, you will probably appreciate this more.

In the book Landon was a somewhat ""bad boy"" because he didnt take school seriously and was a smart mouth, bad by 1950's standards. In the movie they made him be malicious to other people to make him ""bad"".The sweet story of the penny jar and the presents for the orphanage is left out, which I really enjoyed from the book.This is an awful version of a book to movie.

Its the story of a popular boy named Landon whose life changes after he causes another boy to be injured in a accident.  After this, he meets the nice and pretty Jamie who is the preacher's daughter and a devout Christian.  At first, he is so afraid to be seen talking to her that he ignores her in front of his friends, but after getting to know her, they both fall in love.  And this is where the story gets very sad.This isn't just a typical ""Love Story"" rip-off, this film had a lot of heart and soul.  Through falling in love with Jamie and watching her succumb to her illness, he changes as a person and becomes better for it.  And then there is all the romantic stuff that makes it such a special film.  Its definitely a movie that will make you cry and its rare in that it shows how one person can change the whole path of your life.""A Walk to Remember"" is also about rising above peer pressure and making choices of your own.  It doesn't have to rely on sex to make the romance work.  The rare film is able to do that and this is the kind anyone can see and enjoy.  I was pleasantly surprised to see how good Mandy Moore did in this film.  She was completely able to capture the innocent and good Jamie and I hope to see her in other films.All in all, this is a real tearjerker with a very good message.

It seemed to be yet another stereotypical cardboard cut out of recent teen movies in the past few years.  There are a few 'chick flicks' that I have enjoyed in the past, but they're not my favorite movies. But, because of my friends eagerness to see the movie, I gave in, and went to see it.  The results were very surprising. This movie wasn't just another average 'chick flick,' it was something much more.  It became one of my all-time favorite movies.The movie is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, and tells the wonderful tale of two people who are the definite opposites of one another only to be brought together by a miracle.  There is Jamie Sullivan, played brilliantly by Mandy Moore, who is a shy and meek girl who is always teased on by her peers.  Her head remains strong however, because she doesn't allow the rude and immature comments penetrate and hamper her uplifting spirit.  This is a true definition of a great person.  I always admire someone who isn't afraid to be themselves and not be terribly afraid of what other people would think or change themselves to be something they're not.  Jamie has high morals that she never allows to be jeopardized.  There is also Landon, played by Shane West, whose only concern in life is not to jeopardize his reputation in other people's eyes.  Both of these characters are brought together by an incident and fall amazingly in love.  This tells a wonderful and amazing story of how true love can be.Before watching this film, I doubted Mandy Moore's acting capabilities, but now I realize just how fitting she was for this role.

From the moment I saw her entering the cemetery, in the dead of night, to pursue her love of the celestial, it was over for me: I have never been so enchanted with a character. Now, I, personally, can take astronomy or leave it. But it's what it represents that makes her so appealing. Most people in America do things because of how they wish to be perceived within their peer group. But Jamie is into astronomy for its own sake. It is something she loves, for her own reasons. What other motivation could she have? After all, nobody is going to get elected homecoming queen for lugging a telescope around a cemetery at night.It's not something you do to be accepted. It's something she did because of who she was.She was so charming, and so beautiful, but also so strong and independent. So kind, but also so sincere.Jamie was as close to the ideal woman as I can imagine. Yes, I know, I know.....she's not real(although I do seem to recall reading that she was inspired by a real person). But the response she awakens within me is quite real.Based upon some of the comments I've heard from other guys, I can tell that I'm not the only one who sees her in this light.They say you can't wear out a dvd.

At long last, we get a love story devoid of the sexual overtones so prevalent in today's society (I don't have anything against sex in movies, it's just that I prefer the classic romance films, like ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone With The Wind"" [see my reviews on these and others like them]). THIS film deserves to stand among them as a symbol of family-friendly (if you don't mind the mild language and subtle sexual innuendos-hey, movies aren't devoid of reality and this stuff happens every day) entertainment. Mandy Moore, fresh off her film debut, plays the preacher's down-to-earth, beautiful and ""Almost ethereal"" daughter Jamie Sullivan so well that I almost thought she was real. Shane West turns in an equally fine performance as the teen who, against his will, finds himself drawn to Jamie and subsequently, comes to appreciate her for who she is and what she represents. Darryl Hannah (the villainous one-eyed assassin Elle from ""Kill Bill"" [see my review on it]), Peter Coyote, David Andrews (Claire Danes' dad in ""Terminator 3"" [see my review on that one and ""The Terminator"" in my review of ""Terminator 2""])and the rest of the cast add to the tenderness of this film, so lovingly adapted from the book on which it is based.

The book takes place in 1958, the characters have different physical characteristics and absolutely none of the scenes were identical. It seems that the only thing that they remained faithful to is the characters' names.And while I probably would have liked the book if I had read it by myself, I thought Mandy Moore added a little extra to Jaime Sullivan's character. The chemistry between her and Shane West was sweet, not overly sappy and charmingly honest.I thought the book left out a lot too.

Simply put, it gives a reason to hope for something better than superficial lovey-dovey stuff. Though this film has people exemplifying stereotypes (overprotective preacher-father, cool guy that's rebellious, preacher's daughter who doesn't care for popularity, etc.), most of the characters change to be a deeper personality by the end of the film. And for this movie, it's worth that change.About that preacher's daughter, she also shows that Christians aren't a bunch of boring, bland people who don't have humor and only want to serve in soup kitchens- she also has wit sometimes when she gets made fun of for her fashion, sense, and belief. And when the cool guy needs help for the school play (for which he's forced into as part of his punishment for getting drunk and causing an accident that paralyzes a fellow student in the beginning), her one condition almost sounds like a no-brainer for him... until he finds he can't help but break that one rule (part of his rebellious nature?), and doing so helps him see another side of her he never thought he knew existed- a side of her with ambitions, questions, hopes and dreams that go beyond the church her father tries to put a handle on.Then again, her father does happen to have a thing or two (thousand) against the guy, Shane. Namely, that he's a typical rebellious ""dude"", always looking bored, never thinking the preacher notices him, and has always been judging him for it. Typical, huh?Well, things change. Not too quick (lest it be another overly cheesy Christian flick), nor too slowly (lest it be another bland romance flick), but at the right pace. And with the situations and twists that pop up, you find out more about each person and each person's view of someone else, breakign their own perceptions of each other.

I've left a review on the film itself already, so please check that out. So now I'll leave a review on the overall DVD. The DVD includes two commentaries, the first by Mandy Moore, Shane West, and director Adam Shankman. It is a very interesting and funny commentary, and it is fun to listen to. But the 2nd commentary by author Nicholas Sparks and the screenwriter is much more fact-filled and interesting. Overall, both commentaries are essential to hear if you want to learn more about the making of the film. Next we have the music video for the main song of the film, &quot;Cry&quot; by Mandy Moore. Now this has got to be Mandy's greatest video ever, she looks great in it, and her voice is amazing. Shane also made an appearance in the video, which makes it alot better. Overall the video is very well done, and it is a great special feature. Then you can watch the trailer to the film, the full-length theatrical trailer, which as with any film, is a nice feature. The last thing is the Cast biographies and filmographies of Shane West, Mandy Moore, and two more cast members. The film includes English and French audio, and it has English and Frech subtitles. The only dissapointment you might realise, is that during Mandy's singing, there are no subtitles. So go buy the DVD if you haven't already.

Mandy Moore plays Jamie, an honest and devout Christian who has good morals and a good head on her shoulders. Jamie is picked on in high school by the popular crowd, in which Landon (Shane West) is a part of. Based on a prank/accident, Landon is the only one caught of his friends and he is punished by being forced to tutor the handicapped, janitorial tasks, and to take part in a play. Jamie has written the music for the play, and at first Landon and Jamie don't get along, he is concerned with his image and the perception others have of him. He grows past this and realizes he has deep feelings for Jamie. Jamie has a list of things she wants to accomplish in life, and Landon helps her acheive some of them. However, Jamie's dad is a minister who does not approve of Landon, but slowly Landon wins him over and her dad lets him take her on a date. Jamie and Landon fall in love. Through the story we learn of Landon's estranged relationship with his father. Before Jamie and Landon start dating, she tells him he has to promise not to fall in love with her, but ultimately he does and she confesses that she is dying of leukemia. Feeling ashamed she pushes him away and he is so torn about what to do, he goes to his father and they patch up their differences when he offers to pay for home care for Jamie. Landon makes her a telescope, and they see a shooting star. In the end Jamie and Landon marry, and she dies later in the summer.

Bernabo,"[19, 22]","&quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is another one of those bad boy/good girl movies that manages to transcend the fact that we have seen this story dozens of times.  The bad boy is Landon Carter (Shane West), who runs with the popular crowd and is responsible for a dare than has tragic consequences.  The principal decides Landon needs to meet some new people are orders him to help the janitors, tutor at the grade school, and join the drama club.  That last one is important because it brings the bad boy and the good girl together, but the idea that the principal can put the &quot;bad boy&quot; into the school's big production where he can ruin it for everybody else bothers me big time.The good girl is Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), the daughter of a widowed reverend, who stands apart at school because she carries her Bible and always wears the same blue sweater.  Although she is the subject of looks and comments from Landon's crowd, she never bat's an eye because she really does not care what others think about her; she has a numbered list of what she wants to do during her life.  The film does not make a lot out of the fact that Jamie is a Christian, but it is certainly a key part of her as a person.  What I liked is that Jamie is a &quot;good&quot; Christian, by which I mean that she not only embodies her faith but that she does so without pushing it on anybody else.  The stereotype in films is for Christians to be judgmental and superior, which constitutes an implicit attack on such characters.  The character of Jamie might be too good to be true, but she is what makes this film work.More importantly, she gets the great line.  Early on in the film as Landon continues to take shots at her, Jamie looks him up and down, makes a couple of totally on target remarks and finishes him off with the declaration, &quot;You act only works on an audience.&quot;  It is one of those lines that makes you sit up and take notice, whether you are watching the film or simply the character at whom it was targeted.  Meanwhile, he has the most romantic moment in the film, when he fulfills one of the items on her list (being in two places at once).  Ultimately what makes &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; so differen from your standard teenage films is that it is about romance and not sex.  Hopefully some of the teenage males who watch this film will get a clue on what romance means and how powerful it can be.  But I have to worry that your average teenager is not in a position to appreciate a movie like this where the teenagers are intelligent and written that way.For this 2002 film the novel by Nicholas Sparks, which was set in 1958, is told in the &quot;present&quot; (it is not linked to any particular year).  I was fortunate that once again I was oblivious to the big twist and did not know it was coming even before the opening credits.  My biggest hint that something was amiss was when we find out what is #1 on Jamie's list and I did not think it was big enough to have the top spot.  Of course, in the end it all makes sense.  My only complaint with the end is that when we get to the obvious thing that needs to be said it just gets said and I was expecting it to get punched up for the grand finale.  It would not have been that hard: Landon gives the Reverend Sullivan one of the two important books in Jamie's life, so the Reverend should have given Landon the OTHER book and in it would have been that which needed to be said.",4,A particularly good girl reforms a quite romantic bad boy,1077408000,"02 22, 2004",2004,3459,"['quot', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'quot', 'one', 'bad', 'boy/good', 'girl', 'movies', 'transcend', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'story', 'times', 'bad', 'boy', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'Shane', 'West', 'who', 'popular', 'crowd', 'responsible', 'dare', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'principal', 'decides', 'Landon', 'meet', 'new', 'people', 'are', 'orders', 'help', 'janitors', 'tutor', 'grade', 'school', 'join', 'drama', 'club', 'last', 'one', 'important', 'bad', 'boy', 'good', 'girl', 'together', 'idea', 'principal', 'can', 'put', 'quot', 'bad', 'boy', 'quot', 'school', 'big', 'production', 'where', 'can', 'ruin', 'everybody', 'else', 'bothers', 'big', 'time.The', 'good', 'girl', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'daughter', 'widowed', 'reverend', 'who', 'apart', 'school', 'Bible', 'always', 'same', 'blue', 'sweater', 'subject', 'looks', 'comments', 'Landon', 'crowd', 'never', 'bat', 'eye', 'really', 'not', 'care', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'numbered', 'list', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'film', 'not', 'make', 'lot', 'fact', 'Jamie', 'Christian', 'certainly', 'key', 'part', 'person', 'What', 'liked', 'Jamie', 'quot', 'good', 'quot', 'Christian', 'mean', 'not', 'only', 'faith', 'so', 'pushing', 'anybody', 'else', 'stereotype', 'films', 'Christians', 'be', 'judgmental', 'superior', 'implicit', 'attack', 'such', 'characters', 'character', 'Jamie', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'good', 'be', 'true', 'what', 'film', 'work.More', 'importantly', 'great', 'line', 'Early', 'film', 'Landon', 'take', 'shots', 'Jamie', 'up', 'down', 'couple', 'totally', 'target', 'remarks', 'finishes', 'off', 'declaration', 'quot', 'act', 'only', 'audience.', 'quot', 'one', 'lines', 'sit', 'up', 'take', 'notice', 'are', 'watching', 'film', 'simply', 'character', 'whom', 'was', 'targeted', 'Meanwhile', 'most', 'romantic', 'moment', 'film', 'when', 'one', 'items', 'list', 'being', 'two', 'places', 'once', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'quot', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'quot', 'differen', 'standard', 'teenage', 'films', 'romance', 'not', 'sex', 'Hopefully', 'teenage', 'males', 'who', 'watch', 'film', 'will', 'get', 'clue', 'what', 'romance', 'means', 'how', 'powerful', 'can', 'be', 'have', 'worry', 'average', 'teenager', 'not', 'position', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'where', 'teenagers', 'are', 'intelligent', 'written', 'way.For', '2002', 'film', 'novel', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'was', 'set', '1958', 'told', 'quot', 'present', 'quot', 'not', 'linked', 'particular', 'year', 'was', 'fortunate', 'once', 'again', 'was', 'oblivious', 'big', 'twist', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'was', 'coming', 'even', 'opening', 'credits', 'biggest', 'hint', 'something', 'was', 'amiss', 'was', 'when', 'find', 'out', 'what', '1', 'Jamie', 'list', 'did', 'not', 'think', 'was', 'big', 'enough', 'have', 'top', 'spot', 'course', 'end', 'sense', 'only', 'complaint', 'end', 'when', 'get', 'obvious', 'thing', 'be', 'said', 'just', 'said', 'was', 'expecting', 'get', 'punched', 'up', 'grand', 'finale', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'hard', 'Landon', 'Reverend', 'Sullivan', 'one', 'two', 'important', 'books', 'Jamie', 'life', 'Reverend', 'should', 'have', 'given', 'Landon', 'OTHER', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'needed', 'be', 'said']",N/A
591492,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B00005JKVZ,Lee Armstrong,"[0, 0]","This was an enjoyable movie to watch.  Nicholas Sparks' 2nd novel to be brought to the screen, &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; being the first, is not innovative, but it is touching.  What I enjoyed most was seeing Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore) be a girl who had strong religious beliefs and was true to them.  She didn't sacrifice what she thought was right to be popular, didn't lapse into anger at God as a result of her illness, and yet experienced life to its fullest including falling in love and marriage.  Her character is a stunning study in faith-based lifestyle.I also enjoyed the transformation of Landon Carter (Shane West) from a troubled kid, adjusting from a divorce to a young man inspired by love to accomplish his best, becoming a medical doctor.  Because of these two main characters, those who substitute negativity for depth will consider the movie shallow; and those who equate sleaze with style will consider the movie unfashionable.  But in reality, it is the best of both because it's an inspiration that calls to the best in each of us.That said, it's not a perfect film.  West achieves a better handle on his role, adding more nuance and dimension than does Moore.  However, she certainly makes Sullivan come to life.  Peter Coyote gives another concrete performance as Reverend Sullivan.  Daryl Hannah does a great job as mother Cynthia Carter. Living in North Carolina, I enjoyed Mandy Moore ordering sweet tea, but wondered about the outside cafe next to the water and how many mosquitoes they had to swat shooting the romantic scene.  As a theatre instructor, I was also unhappy that Landon had to be sentenced to being in a play which made it seem like punishment!  Adam Shankman did a great job of direction.  You have to walk into a project like this knowing that you're going to get your hits from those who want to watch cop cars collide and more graphic romance.  He delivered what was needed; this film fires successfully and touches the heart.  The VHS version includes the Mandy Moore music video after the feature which has universes gliding by Shane West's head.

You also get movies designed to promote popstars such Britney Spears and &quot;Crossroads&quot;. Thank God this isn't a movie like that. Speaking of God, this movie does feature Christian values but in a non-preachy way. The movie is simply about having faith in what you believe in. I'd never read the novel before hand so I had no previous notion of what this movie should be about. I watched it in a non-cynical way and with an open mind. I discovered that Mandy Moore was fantastic, as was Shane West. I'd already seen much of Shane West's work in tv and film so I was able to maintain my respect for the actor here. Mandy Moore though is more than a popstar and quite an accomplished actor. I'd only seen her in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;, and now after seeing this I want to see more of her. &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is unashamedly romantic. Ignore all the negative reviews regarding this movie and accept it for what it is.As for the DVD itself. The commentary by the original author and screenplay writer is fascinating. The other commentary featuring Mandy Moore, Shane West and the director is quite cluttered at the beginning with them talking over each other, but after a while they do get used to giving their commentary, and there is a seemingly nice bond between the three. The DVD also features the trailer and a music video from Mandy Moore. It would have been nice if there was a featurette and some deleted scenes which apparently do exist but were omitted from this DVD. However all in all, the movie itself is worth the buy. &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; is a movie to remember.

591507,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,B00005JKVZ,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[5, 5]","Another Amazon reviewer who has consistently given me good recommendations, directed me to this movie.  I'm glad he did because had he not, I might never have watched because this movie appears to be just another maudlin teen movie.  Instead I found the story to be sensitive and compelling.We are introduced to Landon Carter (Shane West) at the very beginning of the movie.  Landon is one of the ""popular"" crowd, and he and several other teenagers have challenged another teenager to jump into a pool of water, where he immediately becomes injured.  I quickly disliked Landon and had him pegged as shallow with too much time on his hands; his only goal was to have fun.  During the initial portion of the movie I struggled to keep watching because Landon's character was too stereotypical and too shallow.  Landon is the kind of person I avoided in high school.Soon we meet Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore).  Jamie is everything that Landon is not.  She is serious and focused.  She is involved and has goals.  It's also immediately apparent that Jamie is considered a geek and is about as far from being popular as a high school person can be.  Yet, I found Jamie to be far more interesting than Landon, and once she was introduced I started to become interested in the story.At first I thought that Landon was going to spend a fair amount of time trying to have sex with Jamie.  He started his relationship in just that way.  Jamie has a healthy dose of skepticism for the motives of ""popular"" males and sees his advances for what they are.  Jamie intrigues Landon.  She is everything he is not.  Landon likes her self-assurance, her goals for the future.  In spite of his background, he finds himself falling for her.Jamie, on the other hand, is the daughter of Reverend Sullivan, played by Peter Coyote.  Initially it appeared that the Reverend was a very restrictive father, particularly since Jamie is not allowed to date.  Eventually Landon talks with Reverend Sullivan and asks him if Jamie can go to dinner with him.  While Reverend Sullivan is at first reluctant, he senses Landon's sincerity and relents, with strict admonition regarding the time that Jamie must be home.We are soon deeply involved in the romance between Jamie and Landon.  Jamie shares her goals with Landon, some of which he tries to make come true.  One of my favorites was Jamie's goal of being in two places at once.  Landon figures a cool way of making it happen.  Jamie has a lengthy list of goals, a number of which Landon makes come true.Eventually we find that Jamie has a secret that she reluctantly must share with Landon.  Rather than pushing Landon away, Jamie's secret causes Landon to fall so deeply in love with Jamie that the rest of the movie is incredibly, wonderfully beautiful and poignant.I puzzled for much of the first part of the movie to figure out what this movie was really about.  Was it about Landon?  Was it about Jamie?  Was it about the two of them together?  It took me until the end of the movie to realize that the central character was always Landon.  Jamie remains the same person from the beginning to the end, a beautiful soul.  Landon starts the film as a shallow person, but changes his life to one of purpose by his exposure to Jamie.  We see Jamie fill Landon with a sense of resolve that will carry him through the rest of his life.After having seen so many awful teen movies, it was wonderful to find one that treated teenagers as people with hopes, dreams and goals.  Jamie's secret is profound and sad, but Jamie's secret was but one step in Landon becoming a sensitive man with goals of his own.  Therein lays the beauty of this movie.  It recognizes that all things beautiful require evolution, and the love that Jamie and Landon share evolves naturally versus a single event that pushes the two toward love.  I strongly recommend this movie for teenagers and older family members, avoiding the younger members of the family due to some of the situations and profanity.

591514,A165JPQFQQAF09,B00005JKVZ,Magneto,"[1, 1]","I don't mind admitting it - I'm a 30 year old guy who really likes this film, and if there's one phrase I hate, it's ""chick flick"" - I'd like to get my hands on whoever coined that phrase!. Apart from immediately limiting a film's potential maximum audience once it's been branded a ""chick flick"" (which no doubt this one has), it assumes that guys won't like it. Well I can tell you that not only do a lot of us guys want to see a good romantic film, we also aren't all into action and sci-fi films, we just like a good story. Now I've got that out of the way...A walk to remember seems to get better with each viewing. The first time I saw it I just thought it was ok, but quite cliched. But there are certains elements of the film I really liked, so I watched it again and really enjoyed it. For starters, it nice to see a charming, sweet-natured film that doesn't feel the need to resort to scenes of a sexual nature, or that uses crude/vulgar humor. This alone for me lifts AWTR above your typical ""teen movie"". Then you have great performances from the two leads of Mandy Moore & Shane West, who do the script proud. I particularly like Mandy's character Jamie, who although definitely isn't the coolest person in school, is confident enough about herself to not let other people's opinions worry her (except for one incident in the film). I think it's this personality trait that first appeals to Shane West's character Landon, who *does* worry (initially) what is and isn't perceived as being cool, and often succumbs to peer pressure. It's this transforming of character for Landon that takes him onto ""a walk to remember"".One of my favorite scenes in the movie is where Landon takes Jamie to the state line one night and tells her to stand over it. He then tells here that she's in two places at the same time-  thus realizing one of her dreams.  Talk about romantic!. Another scene I like is where Jamie asks Landon to promise not to fall in love with her, which at the time seems a little arrogant  and which Landon laugh's off. It's only later you find out the relevance of her request. I also like the play scene where Mandy sings ""Only hope"". Mandy sings impeccably, looks beautiful, and this is where I believe Landon really falls in love with her.Unfortunately the DVD of AWTR is a little thin on extras. What you do get however is two good commentaries. The first is from Mandy, Shane, and the director Adam Shankman which they all recorded together (doesn't always happen that way). They share anecdotes from making the movie, have a laugh, and generally makes a very entertaining commentary. This is probably the one most people will listen to, but the other is also worth checking out. This second commentary is from the original novelist of AWTR Nicholas Sparks, and Karen Janszen who adapted it for the screen. This commentary is very interesting as they talk about the differences between the book and the movie, how it was adapted for a modern day setting, what they thought of the cast, amongst other things. On the DVD you also get the music video for Mandy Moore's ""Cry"", but that's about it. There's no ""making of"" or behind the scenes stuff. And there's not even any deleted scenes, even though they are mentioned several times on the cast/director commentary track!.AWTR is more a romantic drama than comedy, so those looking for laughs may want to look elsewhere (although Mandy's retort ""God's too busy looking for your brain"" is hilarious!). That said, this is a very good movie, well acted, and the nature of the story should make it appeal to many older viewers - male and female alike - that will lift it above typical teen fare.",4,A great old-fashioned love story,1027728000,"07 27, 2002",2002,3666,"['do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'admitting', ""'m"", '30', 'year', 'old', 'guy', 'who', 'really', 'film', 'one', 'phrase', 'hate', 'chick', 'flick', ""'d"", 'like', 'get', 'hands', 'whoever', 'coined', 'phrase', 'Apart', 'immediately', 'limiting', 'film', 'potential', 'maximum', 'audience', 'been', 'branded', 'chick', 'flick', 'doubt', 'one', 'guys', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like', 'Well', 'can', 'tell', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'lot', 'guys', 'want', 'see', 'good', 'romantic', 'film', 'also', 'are', ""n't"", 'action', 'sci-fi', 'films', 'just', 'good', 'story', 'Now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'way', 'walk', 'remember', 'get', 'better', 'viewing', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'ok', 'quite', 'cliched', 'are', 'elements', 'film', 'really', 'liked', 'watched', 'again', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'starters', 'nice', 'see', 'charming', 'sweet-natured', 'film', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'resort', 'scenes', 'sexual', 'nature', 'crude/vulgar', 'humor', 'alone', 'lifts', 'AWTR', 'typical', 'teen', 'movie', 'Then', 'have', 'great', 'performances', 'two', 'leads', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Shane', 'West', 'who', 'do', 'script', 'proud', 'particularly', 'Mandy', 'character', 'Jamie', 'who', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'coolest', 'person', 'school', 'confident', 'enough', 'not', 'let', 'other', 'people', 'opinions', 'worry', 'one', 'incident', 'film', 'think', 'personality', 'trait', 'first', 'appeals', 'Shane', 'West', 'character', 'Landon', 'who', '*does*', 'worry', 'initially', 'what', ""n't"", 'perceived', 'being', 'cool', 'often', 'peer', 'pressure', 'transforming', 'character', 'Landon', 'walk', 'remember', '.One', 'favorite', 'scenes', 'movie', 'where', 'Landon', 'Jamie', 'state', 'line', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'then', 'here', 'two', 'places', 'same', 'time-', 'thus', 'realizing', 'one', 'dreams', 'Talk', 'romantic', 'scene', 'like', 'where', 'Jamie', 'Landon', 'promise', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'time', 'little', 'arrogant', 'Landon', 'laugh', 'off', 'only', 'later', 'find', 'out', 'relevance', 'request', 'also', 'play', 'scene', 'where', 'Mandy', 'Only', 'hope', 'Mandy', 'impeccably', 'beautiful', 'where', 'believe', 'Landon', 'really', 'love', 'her.Unfortunately', 'DVD', 'AWTR', 'little', 'thin', 'extras', 'What', 'do', 'get', 'however', 'two', 'good', 'commentaries', 'first', 'Mandy', 'Shane', 'director', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'recorded', 'together', ""n't"", 'always', 'happen', 'way', 'share', 'making', 'movie', 'have', 'laugh', 'generally', 'very', 'entertaining', 'commentary', 'probably', 'one', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'listen', 'other', 'also', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'second', 'commentary', 'original', 'novelist', 'AWTR', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'Karen', 'Janszen', 'who', 'adapted', 'screen', 'commentary', 'very', 'interesting', 'talk', 'differences', 'book', 'movie', 'how', 'was', 'adapted', 'modern', 'day', 'setting', 'what', 'thought', 'cast', 'other', 'things', 'DVD', 'also', 'get', 'music', 'video', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Cry', 'making', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'not', 'even', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'even', 'are', 'mentioned', 'several', 'times', 'cast/director', 'commentary', 'track', '.AWTR', 'more', 'romantic', 'drama', 'comedy', 'looking', 'laughs', 'may', 'want', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'Mandy', 'retort', 'God', 'too', 'busy', 'looking', 'brain', 'hilarious', 'said', 'very', 'good', 'movie', 'well', 'acted', 'nature', 'story', 'should', 'make', 'appeal', 'many', 'older', 'viewers', 'male', 'female', 'alike', 'will', 'lift', 'typical', 'teen', 'fare']",N/A

I was just crying and crying.I must admit I was totally blown away not just because it is so good but it was colliding with the book.  I thought it was set in the late 50's not the early 2003 or whenever this movie was made.  I was a little uneasy because it just didnt really parallel with the book.  Of course no movie influenced by a book really follows it.  But there was so many different things added to this or changed.  It never really bothered me until I started wising up.  But I stil love the movie.Now for the positive.  Mandy Moore really shines in this movie with her sweet, compassionate personality.  Jamie Sullivan is young woman who loves God and takes little things, like breathing, walking, or whatever and calls them a blessing.  She is very compassionate and loves life.  She would be a great friend to have.  Just someone to talk to and get advice.  I have yet find someone like that.Shane West really portrays the punk sorta guy who is just getting through life with looks and language.  Throughout this movie you can see a very definite change in his face and his attitude.  In the beginning, to me, I felt like shunning him yet I was drawn to him.  As a Christian, I have those feelings stay away yet get closer.  This movie portrays it well.  Landon Carter is that type of person that makes me want to go out and find people like that and help.All in all, this movie is wonderful and when you see it have a box of kleenex handy because you will need it.

I did get teary though, but not full-blown. Dunno what can be said for my boyfriend, who I was watching it with, who disappeared off to the toilet as soon as the credits rolled! :) (Think I've embarrassed him now?)My mum's had the Nicholas Sparks books for a while now - as soon as a new one is out, she gets it. So far I've only seen the Message In A Bottle movie, and read the book, although I recently bought The Notebook, but haven't had a chance to watch it yet. I definitely hope more of his books get made into movies, as he's rumoured to be writing a sequel to this as well.I was quite shocked seeing Mandy Moore, as I didn't recognise her at first - she looked so young! I'd previously only seen her in Saved, and she had a completely different hairstyle in this, and a terrific makeup artist by the look of things. She looked much like she did when she arrived on the music scene, except she was blonde then. She couldn't complete with the Britneys, Christinas & Jessicas that were around at the time, so she moved into acting, and hasn't looked back! The only quibble I have about Mandy is she seems to sing in the movies I've seen her in, and the characters she plays are always Christian.I wasn't particularly keen on Shane West's character to begin with - he was like every other guy who I've met, who's a complete & utter jerk, and acts differently around their friends, to how they do around you.The movie was shot in North Carolina; many of the sets were from the TV show Dawson's Creek - particularly the school, hospital and Landon's home.I'm definitely going to be reading the book next, and I'll probably read some of Nicholas Spark's other novels, and I'll decide what should be made into a movie next. The inspiration for Jamie Sullivan's character and some of the events in the book/movie; is from Nicholas Sparks' sister, Danielle Sparks Lewis (whom the book and movie are dedicated to). The novel is set in 1958. When Jaimie gives Landon her mother's book she says ""Don't worry, it's not a bible."" In the novel by Nicholas Sparks, Jaimie does give him her mother's bible which has her favorite passages underlined.I did find the ending quite predictable, and although I'm not going to give anything away, I did think it should have finished after they did what they did, rather then five minutes. (Five minutes is a long time when you've been sitting in one position without moving, and you have a dead leg!)The extras on this DVD aren't much to write about, but I'll list them anyway. They include: commentary by Shane West, Mandy Moore and Adam Shankman; commentary by director Nicholas Sparks and screenwriter Karen Janszen and music video ""Cry"" by Mandy Moore.I watched this movie at my boyfriend's, although I'd already had it on my wishlist, I'm definitely going to buy it for myself now! It's one of those movies which needs to be watched again & again - plus my mum now wants to see it.

Strangely enough, looking at my list of reviews, the review is still present but it says ""no title"" and ""unavailable"", and this review is NOT listed in the main Amazon product page for this movie.  Just . . . odd.  Anyway, reposting my review of ""A Walk to Remember"".Mike London 9-10-2012-----------A WALK TO REMEMBER is both a refreshing and down-to-earth romantic movie where innocence has a place and forgiveness actually does happen. Nicholas Sparks, who wrote MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, also wrote this and THE RESCUE.Mandy Moore plays Jamie Sullivan, a ""goody-two shoes"" who really gets to know the ""bad boy"" Landon Carter, played by Shane West. Landon, responsible for getting another guy in a bad car wreck on a dare, must tutor students and take part in a school play production. While they knew one another all their lives, Jamie and Landon begin a real friendship together. This relationship becomes romantic, with a few twists that I won't give away here.A WALK TO REMEMBER is actually a radical film. Our culture uses satire and irony as the most prevalent comments on society. Everyone's a cynic. The 1950s churned out this ""family fare"" where no one has any real problems and everyone's basically a good person. The 1950s turned into the 1960s, the polar opposite.This movie takes those virtues such as faith, redemption, innocent, virginity, and forgiveness and puts them in the new millennium by dealing with actual issues. This is not the candy-caned world of Andy Griffith and that generation. This is a world where teenage pregnancy is common, alcohol abuse prevalent, and positive role models hard to come by. This is a world where there's of anger and hate.A WALK TO REMEMBER gives us this world, but it is also a place where couples believe in sex only in marriage. It's where Bible-believing conservatives are real people who love one another and have an open mind, and their values are not given the stereotypical cynical slant. This is a movie that actually uses profanity for a purpose, to give texture and character, which most movies do not do. Most movies now days have profanity just to have it in there. A WALK TO REMEMBER uses profanity because the characters it describes would use profanity. Just as the it uses profanity to describe people, A WALK TO REMEMBER also gives us a young woman who truly believes in Christ, who loves her father dearly, and a young man who is touched very deeply by this young woman. In an age as cynical and skeptical as ours, this is indeed radical.",4,"4 & 1/2 Stars: Actually, quite a radical film for this era, March 1, 2002",1347235200,"09 10, 2012",2012,2566,"['wrote', 'posted', 'review', 'way', 'back', '2002', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'looking', 'list', 'reviews', 'review', 'still', 'present', 'title', 'unavailable', 'review', 'NOT', 'listed', 'main', 'Amazon', 'product', 'page', 'movie', 'Just', 'odd', 'Anyway', 'reposting', 'review', 'A', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'London', '9-10-2012', '-A', 'WALK', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'refreshing', 'down-to-earth', 'romantic', 'movie', 'where', 'innocence', 'place', 'forgiveness', 'actually', 'happen', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'who', 'wrote', 'MESSAGE', 'IN', 'A', 'BOTTLE', 'also', 'wrote', 'THE', 'RESCUE.Mandy', 'Moore', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'goody-two', 'shoes', 'who', 'really', 'know', 'bad', 'boy', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'played', 'Shane', 'West', 'Landon', 'responsible', 'getting', 'guy', 'bad', 'car', 'wreck', 'dare', 'must', 'tutor', 'students', 'take', 'part', 'school', 'play', 'production', 'knew', 'one', 'lives', 'Jamie', 'Landon', 'begin', 'real', 'friendship', 'together', 'relationship', 'romantic', 'few', 'twists', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'here.A', 'WALK', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'actually', 'radical', 'film', 'culture', 'satire', 'irony', 'most', 'prevalent', 'comments', 'society', 'Everyone', 'cynic', '1950s', 'churned', 'out', 'family', 'fare', 'where', 'one', 'real', 'problems', 'everyone', 'basically', 'good', 'person', '1950s', 'turned', '1960s', 'polar', 'opposite.This', 'movie', 'virtues', 'such', 'faith', 'redemption', 'innocent', 'virginity', 'forgiveness', 'new', 'millennium', 'dealing', 'actual', 'issues', 'not', 'candy-caned', 'world', 'Andy', 'Griffith', 'generation', 'world', 'where', 'teenage', 'pregnancy', 'common', 'alcohol', 'abuse', 'prevalent', 'positive', 'role', 'models', 'hard', 'come', 'world', 'where', 'anger', 'hate.A', 'WALK', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'world', 'also', 'place', 'where', 'couples', 'believe', 'sex', 'only', 'marriage', 'where', 'Bible-believing', 'conservatives', 'are', 'real', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'one', 'have', 'open', 'mind', 'values', 'are', 'not', 'given', 'stereotypical', 'cynical', 'slant', 'movie', 'actually', 'profanity', 'purpose', 'give', 'texture', 'character', 'most', 'movies', 'do', 'not', 'do', 'Most', 'movies', 'now', 'days', 'have', 'profanity', 'just', 'have', 'there', 'WALK', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'profanity', 'characters', 'would', 'use', 'profanity', 'Just', 'profanity', 'describe', 'people', 'WALK', 'TO', 'REMEMBER', 'also', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'truly', 'Christ', 'who', 'father', 'dearly', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'touched', 'very', 'deeply', 'young', 'woman', 'age', 'cynical', 'skeptical', 'ours', 'indeed', 'radical']",N/A

591552,A3I312N7ISZ960,B00005JKVZ,"Mr. Nicholas Pearson ""Cert HE (Open)""","[1, 1]","'A Walk to Remember' was the film that first introduced me to the brilliant works of Nicholas Sparks, plus also the talent of actress and singer/songwriter Mandy Moore.  Mandy was very young (seventeen I believe) when she starred in this movie as Jamie Sullivan, and it has been interesting to see her progression in various fields since then to the present day.  I stumbled upon this film on YouTube of all places, whilst randomly searching for videos one afternoon, and I was instantly fixed on the various clips that had been uploaded.  Therefore, I decided to purchase the movie on DVD and watch the production straight through, to make up my own mind surrounding the attention it seemed to gather from fellow YouTubers.  I knew the overall story, as I had read some reviews beforehand, and this is what initially drew me to the movie.The film is based on the book of the same name by Nicholas Sparks, being based in the fictional town of Beaufort.  The book is set in the 1940s/50s, whereas the film is set in more contemporary 1998.  This was done, on the recommendation of Sparks himself, so that the movie could generate more interest with a younger crowd, being set in a more contemporary period.  It is, of course, a love story, but also has a resonance of Christian values that aren't too forcibly placed onto the audience, whether religiously minded or not.  The film focuses on a young lad, Landon Carter (played by the multi-talented Shane West), who is pretty much going nowhere fast and losing his sense of identity along the way, i.e. hanging around with the wrong crowd and getting in trouble with the law etc.  A young girl, Jamie Sullivan (Moore), who is also the town minister's daughter, has known of Landon's reputation for years and befriends him in order to help him with rehearsals in the upcoming school recital, in which he was forced to take part following a teenage prank gone wrong.  Suffice to say, a sweet and romantic love story ensues, as is typical of Sparks's productions, but it is engrained in sadness from the very beginning by the fact that Jamie has terminal leukaemia.  The film deals with this revelation sensitively and the ensuing story is a sheer testament to Sparks' creative mind.The character of Jamie was, in fact, based upon Sparks' own sister, who died of terminal cancer in similar circumstances.  This fact also resonated with me in that this was the first film I had seen to deal with terminal illness since I was diagnosed with a bone-marrow debilitating disease known as Aplastic Anaemia, which has effects very similar to leukaemia.  Over the years, it has helped me deal with the strains of living with this condition, which can sometimes be overbearing, to say the least.  Unfortunately, the film didn't garner a plethora of positive reviews with certain movie critics upon its cinematic release, and the Christian community has made a bit of an uproar concerning some 'over-sexualised' scenes.  This certainly should not deter anybody from seeing the movie, however, and I'm sure the experience will leave you feeling uplifted and grateful for life in general.The film was initially released on VHS and DVD in 2002, and the DVD, distributed by Warner Brothers, is a fairly simple release with few heavy extras (undeniably because of the relatively poor box-office performance, they didn't want to invest heavily on the film distribution).  The film itself is presented in wide-screen letter-box format on the DVD release, whilst the VHS is formatted for full-screen presentation. The DVD also has English and French language audio options, as well as providing subtitles for the English hard-of-hearing, and for those who wish to follow in French or Spanish.  The two main DVD extras included are the two commentaries for the feature film.  I found the commentary by Nicholas Sparks and screen-writer Karen Janszen particularly interesting, as there is a lot of discussion about the process of translating Sparks' original novel into a screen-play, and how certain elements of the book had to be tweaked in order to fit into the film's contemporary setting.  The other commentary includes contributions from the two main cast members, Mandy Moore and Shane West, alongside movie director Adam Shankman.  This is also very interesting, as there is a lot of talk about certain deleted scenes that never made the final cut due to the film board and overall timing constraints.  It really is a shame that none of these deleted scenes were included on this DVD Release as extras, as I got the impression that they would have added more background and comedy into the production as a whole.  Also included is the theatrical trailer for the film and film highlights of the main cast.  Mandy Moore's music video for her single 'Cry' (included on her eponymous third album) is also included as a bonus feature on both formats, in which Shane West stars as Landon looking up to the sky to see Jamie in heaven (presumably!).It would be a shame not to experience this film at least once in your life, and this is why I recommend you to see for yourself Sparks' sensitive production about life, love, forgiveness, and teenage angst.  I would also recommend anyone interested in the film to seek out Sparks' novel of the same name, which is in some ways worlds apart from the movie, but serves as a nice accompaniment to the feature production.  It is, additionally, worth seeking out the movie soundtrack, preferably in its re-release special extended edition, which includes music from Moore herself, Switchfoot, James Foreman, and many other noteworthy performers.",4,'It all comes down to who's by your side!' - Nicholas Sparks's novel brought to life on the big screen!,1369872000,"05 30, 2013",2013,5615,"['Walk', 'Remember', 'was',

I never did expect to watch the movie but recently found myself borrowing it from the library this summer on a rather dreary day.  It's a given that I enjoy sappy.  I cry at movies, while reading books, while listening to music, even during McDonald commercials.

Jamie is smart, introspective, good-natured and an all-around misfit in her high school.  Now meet Landon, almost the complete opposite.  And if not for Landon's selfish act, he may never have met Jamie but meet they do.  And after a brief period of antagonism, become romantically entangled.  To say anything more about the plot would be giving too much away and that's now what a review should do.  But rest assured, this is one memorable film and the first film directed by Sofia Coppolla whom you may remember from playing a lead role in Godfather III.In addition to credible performances by the lead actors, which include Josh Hartnett and Peter Coyote as Jamie's father, the music chosen as a backdrop to the unfolding events  provide a most sentimental mood and the songs sung by Mandy Moore are wonderful.Yes, the movie is sappy and even predictable but don't see if you don't agree with me once you've viewed it.",5,A Memorable Movie!,1031184000,"09 5, 2002",2002,1694,"['Several', 'years', 'ago', 'read', 'book', 'Walk', 'Remember', 'Nicholas', 'Sparks', 'found', 'book', 'rather', 'reminiscent', 'Erich', 'Segal', 'blockbuster', 'novel', 'Love', 'Story', 'When', 'thought', 'more', 'found', 'thinking', 'Love', 'Story', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'read', 'never', 'did', 'expect', 'watch', 'movie', 'recently', 'found', 'borrowing', 'library', 'summer', 'rather', 'dreary', 'day', 'given', 'enjoy', 'sappy', 'cry', 'movies', 'reading', 'books', 'listening', 'music', 'even', 'McDonald', 'commercials', 'considering', 'how', 'felt', 'book', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'was', 'more', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'film.Mandy', 'Moore', 'well-known', 'pop', 'singer', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'only', 'child', 'daughter', 'local', 'widowed', 'preacher', 'Jamie', 'smart', 'introspective', 'good-natured', 'all-around', 'misfit', 'high', 'school', 'Now', 'Landon', 'almost', 'complete', 'opposite', 'not', 'Landon', 'selfish', 'act', 'may', 'never', 'have', 'met', 'Jamie', 'meet', 'do', 'brief', 'period', 'antagonism', 'become', 'romantically', 'entangled', 'say', 'anything', 'more', 'plot', 'would', 'be', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'now', 'what', 'review', 'should', 'do', 'rest', 'assured', 'one', 'memorable', 'film', 'first', 'film', 'directed', 'Sofia', 'Coppolla', 'whom', 'may', 'remember', 'playing', 'lead', 'role', 'Godfather', 'III.In', 'addition', 'credible', 'performances', 'lead', 'actors', 'include', 'Josh', 'Hartnett', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'Jamie', 'father', 'music', 'chosen', 'backdrop', 'unfolding', 'events', 'provide', 'most', 'sentimental', 'mood', 'songs', 'sung', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'are', 'wonderful.Yes', 'movie', 'sappy', 'even', 'predictable', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'once', ""'ve"", 'viewed']",N/A

591590,A21ITRDVUIOLMW,B00005JKVZ,Red Sapphire,"[0, 4]","I enjoyed Richard and Diane very much in this movie. Actors are faced with a genuine challenge when a movie rests on dialogue and their chemistry as opposed to action, adventure and CG. If the lines aren't delivered just right, the whole scene falls flat on its theatrical face.  I thought they both did a great job with the dialogue and with the chemistry between them. Some people have said they didn't see or feel the chemistry, but I did.  That scene on the bridge reminded me of two young lovers, suddenly fully aware of and  totally caught up in one another. I didn't watch Unfaithful. I started to but didn't like the movie, so this was my first time seeing the two of them together.The biggest problem I saw with the movie was that it was too rushed, somehow and that one hospital scene was seriously contrived and mechanical. I think the relationship between Richard and Diane should have been developed a bit more before their first kiss. Also, the time and place of their first kissing scene caught me off guard. I haven't read the book so I don't know if that was how it happened in the story  or a Hollywood invention.Still I was so thrilled to see this romance about an older couple, front and center like that, as opposed to running second to some young couple. It's the reason I gave the movie a ""4"" because I am so weary of unfunny comedies and so-called romance movies that have no emotional depth to them at all.I also liked the background and individual storyline of each character.  Characters have to have started from somewhere to get to the place where we first meet them. In this picture, we're dealing with two mature adults,  and they are going to each have their own emotional baggage. The story doesn't asks us to entertain the far-out or extreme, but to look at how these two people have been affected by their history and how they are reacting to the part of that history that has made its way into their present life.  I loved that scene with the liquor and  can goods!  I didn't find anything trite or cliche about it.

Not only does it prove that teen movies CAN be worth a watch no matter how old you are, it also proves that they can be even better than more 'mature' films in the romance genre.A Walk to Remember is a story about your typical high school romance blossoming between two completely different people... or is it? Not quite. It's better than typical. The female lead is a talented do-gooder daughter of a Church man.... and her male love interest just happens to be the resident school bad boy who hangs out with the type of people who bully and make fun anyone who doesn't fit in with the crowd. Together they learn what it means to be true to themselves and to those they care about, and what it means to fall in love.This touched me in a way that films rarely ever do. I only wish it had come out during my high school years. I truly think that anyone with a soft spot for romance will fall in love with this movie as much as I have, no matter what their age may be... but it's even better if you're a high school girl, searching not only for love, but for a place to belong.

It was that powerful and cutting.I can say right from the start that this film stands apart from most of the typical teen romantic flicks out, and is much more intelligent, emotive, profound and thought-provoking than most. Don't let the &quot;teen romance&quot; title fool you: this film is profound in all cylinders as to transcend a label like that, and powerful enough to win over viewers well into their middle ages, and higher.The story is about a rebellious male youth named Landon (played by Shane West) who gets into trouble with the law due to an act of hazing, and is sent to tutor some kids at a school. He then meets a brainy, goody-goody Preacher's daughter named Jamie (played by singer Mandy Moore), and needless to say, when they meet, both of their lives begin to change. Landon's friends don't think much of Jamie, and make fun of her when she passes them by in and out of school. At first, Landon doesn't seem to think too much of her either, but, he soon realizes the precociousness, maturity, understanding and intelligence she possesses, as well as realizing her ability to see through him: things that he didn't seem to get from any of his friends. As a result, Landon feels a strong confliction within himself, as he seems to be transfixed at the knowledge and perceptive ability of his soon-to-be girlfriend. But, he realizes that if he gets closely involved with this girl, that he may be jeopardizing his bad-boy reputation, as well as his relationship with his bad-boy buddies.There are a vast number of important scenes within this film - some of which give 'slight' (and I mean that in the smallest sense of the term) hints of what the eventual outcome of the story is, and only after viewing the movie a second or third time is when you can detect them. But, other than that, I don't think I ever could have predicted how the story was going to turn out while watching this movie for the first time. (And I've never read the book upon which this is based.)I don't want to give away the biggest turning point in the movie, but I'll list a small few important scenes:(1). Landon realizes that he likes Jamie, and is invited, and willing to study with her at Jamie's house. The next day, while hanging out with his friends, she walks up to him and asks him if he still wants to come to the house, and he humiliates her in front of all of his friends. But, when school ends, and his friends are no longer around him, he sneaks over to her house.(2). Due to jealousy, Landon's ex-girlfriend (and some of his friends) make an attempt (which actually worked) to humiliate Jamie in front of the whole school during a lunch period. Landon steps in, and defends Jamie, which turns into a small fight, and the eventual announcement of an ending regarding Landon and one of his friends' relationship.Later in the movie, things start to change and progress quite rapidly. Things start to unravel, secrets come out, and things are never quite the same: in both a negative and positive sense.To talk about another subject, I was a bit disappointed by the length of the film at first - before I actually began to view it. At first glance, I wanted it to be a bit longer, and I read another review somewhere on this film by someone saying that some of the romantic scenes should have been fleshed out more. I can see where that reviewer is coming from, but after the movie ended, I came to this conclusion: if any of these scenes would have been fleshed out more, I think the emotive power would have been too much to the point of self-indulgence, which in return would have bordered on parody and clich&eacute;, which then would result in the eventual loss of the emotional impact intended. It's that aspect in which I think the writer and director knew exactly what they were doing, as not to compromise the emotional impact, as well as refusing to let the project fall into clich&eacute;d routines. I honestly don't think there could have been much of an improvement over what was already done, without the compromise of some really important elements.Actress Daryl Hannah and actor Peter Coyote give good, supporting roles as Landon's mother and Jamie's father respectively.I heartily applaud this film, the writers and the actors: particularly Mandy Moore and Shane West, as I think they gave an excellent performance. They all helped to make a romantic film that transcends labeling and clich&eacute;s in a market full of each.

Perry ""silentscott""","[0, 1]","Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, A Walk to Remember is an intelligent, sweet, and attentive love story about two teens from different social classes that meet up coincidently and fall in love.The movie begins with the troubled some teen Landon Carter,(Shane West)when trespassed on public property and pressured a friend to jump into a body of water in order to join Landon's group of friends (he jumped).Landon's friend was seriously injured  and the police caught Landon. He was sentenced to do work for his community(tutoring, drama club etc) .  Obviously, his  popularity gets to him until the geeky ""sweater wearing"" Jamie Sullivan(Mandy Moore) saw something good in Landon. Landon, like his meanspirited self, he shews her off ,but finds a reason to need her help with  his lines for drama club. Before they started Jamie warned Landon that he was not to fall in love with her. Later on, inside of him he does love Jamie. This film tragically deals with the peer-pressure of others, how Landon needs to forgive his dad, and  what Landon is faced with when he does fall in love with Jamie.This movie maybe sad and heart warming ,but for sure is a great uplifting movie that even gives a lot of moral values. surprisingly this movie was well made and it worked without the flavorless raunchy jokes and the teenage sex that would make it a teen movie.Thank God we got a grown up movie and not to much what we've seen before in our culture of raunchy teen flicks(sure they are entertaining ,but they do get old). I liked  Mandy Moore in the movie. She seems real and is great on camera. Shane West is great as well as (lets not forget) Jamie's dad, Rev. Sullivan(Peter Coyote) who was likeable and convincing. The movie is charming and at moments is silly ,but overall was enjoyable and just a fun rental or something to watch on HBO. Grade:B",4,A Walk to Remember...

His fine performance gives ballast and perspective in reminding us that these are teens we are watching wage the struggle of their lives. The only off-note is the Belinda (German)/Langdon (West) relationship.

591634,A2U1M5DOGULIQA,B00005JKVZ,"S. Thomas Adelstein ""Tom Adelstein""","[2, 3]","I saw this movie for the first time this year (2007). I didn't read the book. So, you only have my impression of the movie.For anyone who hasn't walked into a sound stage area or studied the Screenplay Paradigm, modern dramatic movies follow the three act model described by Aristotle in his brief but powerful essay called Poetics. As a side note, if you aspire to become a dramatic writer and you haven't read Poetics, shame on you.Shane West and Mandy Moore are the stars of the movie with Shane's Landon Cater as the voice of the play with all action going through him. So, he is the protagonist. You may not have much sympathy for him in the first act, but then you get an impression that he isn't the bully he's portrayed initially. The subtext shows him as more carrying and torn between a kind and gentle nature on his own and the need to associate with the click and bullies of his high school. He also has issues with abandonment of his father acted out in interchanges with his mother played by Daryl Hannah in a dark brunette hair piece.Forced by an incident where he is caught drinking and hurting another boy in a gang related incident, he has to interact with Jamie. First, he associates with her while tutoring disadvantaged children and secondly as an actor in the school's spring play.The interactions between Jamie and Landon are push pull until the second act, which occurs in a major plot point set in the school's screen play. Landon becomes transformed and goes on a path of actions aimed to help Jamie reach her list of goals.The antagonists in the play become his former gang buddies who play jokes on Jamie and take Landon to task for associating with Landon's new love interest, Jamie, the daughter of Reverend Sullivan played by Peter Coyote. (He gives an outstanding performance as a strong, insightful, honest and kind character.)The third act begins with a major plot point that swings the action when Jamie tells Landon she has leukemia. Landon's personal fall occurs as all good students of Poetics know, when Landon goes from a winner having a life changing event. Landon has a great relationship with a beautiful, talented and witty woman that inspires and strengthens him. Suddenly he finds out that everything that raised him to a self-confident young man will disappear. It also throws him back to his primary emotion conflict, the experience of loss that came when his father divorced his mother.Act three takes shape when Landon runs to hid father played by David Lee Smith. Landon feels spurned by his father, while his father actually attempts to help.Act III goes by quickly. The sympathy grows in the audience for Landon and Jamie as she gets closer to death. Resolution occurs when the antagonists come to apologize.In Poetics, the model governing the movie is a tragedy. The audience is genuinely moved. Landon loses Jamie and all the disharmony with her father transforms to love.I've been on many sets, worked in a cutting room, made documentaries and have written screenplays. I recognized every fade, set, cut and shot in the film and it still gripped me emotionally as if it really happened to me.Do I think of its as a great movie? I do, in spite of the sudden disappearance of Daryl Hannah's and David Lee Smith's characters. I can give you a lengthly list of movie making flaws. But, I cannot argue with the results of a budget-challenged movie.Ms. Moore and Mr. West gave performances I thought they had within them to pull off. Instead of musical performers, they appeared as well trained artists from major programs.

I am a 34-year old male that never had much time for most teen movies (except for the more cynical fare like Heathers) and I almost pride myself on my cynicism and acerbic manner. I edited a book entitled ""Teddy Bear Cannibal Massacre.""Needless to say I did not rent this movie, buy this movie or see this movie in the movie theaters.I saw it on network television, late at night. And I couldn't stop watching it. And it's not a great movie - well I don't think it's a great movie - and its faults are staring you right in the face. Mandy Moore's character is too good (she does have her moments of anger but no self-doubt to speak of), the boy is too easily changed by her. The preacher father is a stereotype.

The movie is an adaption from the novel by Nicholas Sparks, and it is transplanted from 1958 to the present day, this admirable teen romance recognizes that two 18-year-olds, Landon and Jamie, can be smart, mature, and sensible about the very real love they share. He's a popular kid in the cool crowd. She's got a goody-goody reputation as the dowdy daughter of a local minister, her values and priorities aren't rooted in peer pressure, and Landon feels blessed by her self-assured nobility. Their mutual affection inevitably heads into Love Story territory, but the movie is honest enough to survive its own schmaltz, and its attractive cast embraces a tone of sincerity and mutual respect.

591657,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005JKVZ,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","[My rating is actually 3.5.]  Mandy Moore and Shane West are Jamie and Landon, a girl and a boy in a high school, both having nothing in common.  Jamie is a kind of a girl whose father is a local minister, and who obeys her father without complaining.  Landon is a boy who would drive a car at midnight, trespass into a factory only to get into trouble.  Then, however, they get interested in each other's lives, and soon fall in love.  The premise sounds very familiar to elder generations who have seen ""Love Story"" (check out young unknown Tommy Lee Jones), or ""Endless Love"" (check out young unknow Tom Cruise).Yes, the story of Nicholas Sparks (one of whose books is turned into film as ""Message in a Bottle"") is very simple and nothing new, and definitely not for the cynical, who would suspect something is wrong when the good-natured teenagers do not get killed or bullied on the screen.  But ""A Walk to Remember"" offers those teenagers, who believe in love, faith, friendship, you name it.  If you don't buy the idea, forget anything about the film and this review.The film is too sweet, reminding some of you of the sugar-coated titles of those oldie songs like ""Teen Angel.""  Sure, ""A Walk to Remember"" is about a good will that prevails, and is too good to be true.  But the actors are playing their roles sincerely, and both leads are incredibly good, so you should forget about the cynical attitudes, and just watch their characters.  Mandy Moore completely succeeded in changing her images, inside and outside alike, giving a convincing character of Jamie.  Shane West is equally good, rebellious and sensitive both at the same time.  Regrettably, the supporting parts are too weak, but those two young talented players hold the entire film to the end.I cannot give more stars than 3 because I have seen this kind of film too much, and I cannot endure to see the inevitable finale of the film with more interest than other younger reviewers would have.

591658,A96K1ZGW56S2I,B00005JKVZ,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[1, 1]","While working at a church camp this summer, I heard a lot of talk from females (both staff members and campers) about the movie A WALK TO REMEMBER. They went on and on about how good it was, how it portrayed love in a realistic way, about its positive image of Christianity, etc. They also said it's a very sad movie that made them cry. Well, right away I knew a major plot point (think big black dude with sickle).Anyway, I've been curious to what all the hubbub was about and when my sister left for school I borrowed her copy of the film and watched it. The film is just about what I expected. It gets a lot of things right that Hollywood usually get wrong. For instance, it:1. Portrays a very realistic love and romance.2. Portrays Christianity in a positive light; both Jamie and her father seem like average, normal, real Christians.3. The situations the teens find themselves in are very real and easy to relate. Landon and his friends swear and like to pull dangerous stunts, etc.However, with all the positive elements the movie fails in one major point: it tries to pretend to be something it is not. The movie is simple a teen chick-flick with a positive, realistic look on life. When the film keeps true to this, it is charming. However, when it veers away from it's true identity and pretends to be something else: such as the cheesy scene where Jamie uses the apologetic explanation about faith--nothing against that argument, I believe it, but in that scene in the movie it's just out of place and doesn't fit; it loses its charm and beauty. I was also bothered by the school in the movie: Landon punches another student and there are no adults around, the students keep leaving school in the middle of the day without family or school officials knowing, what happened to their graduation? I don't know why, but that stuff bothered me and kept me from suspending my disbelief.Overall, a better than average teen-weepy that has a positive look on life.

Fortunately I didn't have to resort that.  I fully expected &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; to be one of those ridiculous chick flicks about the &quot;bad boy&quot; that all the girls seem to fall in love with, and how a good girl changes him.  Well, yes this movie does have that, and a bunch of other glaring cliches and absurdities.  However, surprisingly as a whole the movie worked for me.  I can't explain it, I guess the best way to put it is, the movie's heart was in the right place.  There was a lot of genuine emotion expressed, and Mandy Moore shared some very real and believable chemistry with co-star Shane West.  Mandy proves she can not only act, but also pull a chameleon on us; she is surprisingly believable in her role, in stark contrast to her usually glamorous image.  Yet despite her playing an unpopular &quot;daddy's girl&quot;, Moore is beautiful, adorable, and shines throughout the film, making it no wonder (to me at least) why Landon (West) fell for her.  And I gotta hand it to West; me being unpopular in high school, I tend to hate these cool &quot;bad boys&quot; in movies, but West's charactor earned my respect by the end of the film.  All in all, this is one of the better teen movies, although a sad one.

591665,A2GRK2UONNYH0A,B00005JKVZ,Wayne H. Warren Jr.,"[2, 3]","This is a truly remarkable film.  A great film is characterized by the message that it leaves with its viewers and with the impact that it has on the ""soul"".  This movie scores on both accounts because it is inspiring; it is sad, yet fulfilling; it restores faith in human dignity, while at the same time extolling the beauty in life and in the power of love, the most powerful of all human emotions.It is important not to abandon this film in the beginning, when it appears that it is just another of those uninspiring and ridiculous teenage movies.  At the outset, the film depicts the hero, Landon Carter (Shane West) as just another hare-brained teenager headed for lifelong  problems.  After getting into trouble by pulling a childish initiation prank on a ""friend"", he encounters the school nerd, a preacher's daughter, Jamie Sullivan (Mandy Moore), who is tutoring (voluntarily) problem kids at the same school that Landon is sent to for disciplinary reasons.  Landon has actually been assigned three duties by the school principal for his misbehavior:  janitorial work every day after school, the tutoring, and participation in the school's Spring play.  He encounters Jamie again in the play, where she is a singer.  As the lead male part, Jamie sings to him at the end of the play, her voice and beauty providing another step toward his transformation.  Landon begins to realize that the things that Jamie represents are far loftier than what he has been exposing himself to by hanging around with the ""cool"" kids.  This transformation really blossoms when his ""friends"" prepare a poster depicting Jamie's face on the body of a porn star.  Landon then rejects his old friends, even to the extent of punching his former best friend in the face.After convincing Jamie's pastor father (Peter Coyote) that he should have the faith to allow Landon to take Jamie to dinner on Saturday night, love really begins to bloom after they spend the evening together and take the ""walk to remember"".  Jamie had helped Landon with his lines in the play only on the condition that he not fall in love with her, which was a joke to him at the time.  It is not a joke anymore, especially after Landon admits to Jamie that he has fallen for her and Jamie reminds him of their agreement.  Of course, she must eventually admit both to her father and to Landon that she has also fallen in love.Part of the power in this movie is that, not only is Landon Carter changed by Jamie's love and outlook on life,  but his friends are changed as well, mainly as a result of his transformation.  They come to realize that Jamie's and Landon's love is true and that Jamie's way is far superior to their own.  Jamie's father also learns some important lessons about his daughter's (and thus his own) happiness and that it is worthwhile to have faith in someone who haschanged for the better.  Landon's relationship with his estranged father is also reversed as a result of Jamie's influence.  In other words, Landon's transformation develops into a chain reaction that carries through to almost all of the characters in the movie, all this being ultimately attributed to the influence and positive attitude of one very special young lady.There are many lessons to be learned for young people from this film.  I only hope that many of them will see it and let its message help them to change their attitudes and their lives.  At the minimum, I would like to see many young people be as profoundly affected by this film as I was.My congratulations to the Director, Adam Shankman, the principal players Mandy Moore, Shane West, Peter Coyote, and Daryl Hannah for the superb jobs that they did in making this film into the masterpiece that it is.Changes:  There are a few changes that I would have made in this movie to make it more accurate.  As a professional astronomer, these changes are all related to Jamie's interest in astronomy and telescopes.1. Jamie's line about Pluto should be extended to read ""Pluto rises a few minutes before the Sun and, at magnitude 14, is too faint to be seen by this small telescope anyway.  When I have a larger telescope, it will be possible to see Pluto.""2. In her line about building a larger telescope to see Comet Hyakutake next Spring, the word return should have been omitted because that comet was a first-time visitor from the outer Solar System, at least in recorded history.  Comets are usually discovered and known to become bright far before they reach  the inner Solar System where we can see them clearly.3. I can imagine that the Director felt that the star naming business added a romantic touch to the story, but this practice is a scam and has been strongly discouraged by the International Astronomical Union, the world organization of professional astronomers.  Perhaps some gift along similar lines, such as a Comet Hyakutake necklace or pendant, would have been more appropriate.",5,A Film to Remember for All Time,1147132800,"05 9, 2006",2006,4911,"['truly', 'remarkable', 'film', 'great', 'film', 'characterized', 'message', 'viewers', 'impact', 'soul', 'movie', 'accounts', 'inspiring', 'sad', 'yet', 'fulfilling', 'faith', 'human', 'dignity', 'same', 'time', 'extolling', 'beauty', 'life', 'power', 'love', 'most', 'powerful', 'human', 'emotions.It', 'important', 'not', 'abandon', 'film', 'beginning', 'when', 'just', 'uninspiring', 'ridiculous', 'teenage', 'movies', 'outset', 'film', 'hero', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'Shane', 'West', 'just', 'hare-brained', 'teenager', 'headed', 'lifelong', 'problems', 'getting', 'trouble', 'pulling', 'childish', 'initiation', 'prank', 'friend', 'school', 'nerd', 'preacher', 'daughter', 'Jamie', 'Sullivan', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'who', 'tutoring', 'voluntarily', 'problem', 'kids', 'same', 'school', 'Landon', 'sent', 'disciplinary', 'reasons', 'Landon', 'actually', 'been', 'assigned', 'three', 'duties', 'school', 'principal', 'misbehavior', 'janitorial', 'work', 'day', 'school', 'tutoring', 'participation', 'school', 'Spring', 'play', 'Jamie', 'again', 'play', 'where', 'singer', 'lead', 'male', 'part', 'Jamie', 'sings', 'end', 'play', 'voice', 'beauty', 'providing', 'step', 'transformation', 'Landon', 'realize', 'things', 'Jamie', 'are', 'far', 'loftier', 'what', 'been', 'exposing', 'hanging', 'around', 'cool', 'kids', 'transformation', 'really', 'when', 'friends', 'prepare', 'poster', 'depicting', 'Jamie', 'face', 'body', 'porn', 'star', 'Landon', 'then', 'old', 'friends', 'even', 'extent', 'punching', 'former', 'best', 'friend', 'face.After', 'convincing', 'Jamie', 'pastor', 'father', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'should', 'have', 'faith', 'allow', 'Landon', 'take', 'Jamie', 'dinner', 'Saturday', 'night', 'love', 'really', 'bloom', 'spend', 'evening', 'together', 'take', 'walk', 'remember', 'Jamie', 'had', 'helped', 'Landon', 'lines', 'play', 'only', 'condition', 'not', 'fall', 'love', 'was', 'joke', 'time', 'not', 'joke', 'anymore', 'especially', 'Landon', 'Jamie', 'fallen', 'Jamie', 'agreement', 'course', 'must', 'eventually', 'admit', 'father', 'Landon', 'also', 'fallen', 'love.Part', 'power', 'movie', 'not', 'only', 'Landon', 'Carter', 'changed', 'Jamie', 'love', 'outlook', 'life', 'friends', 'are', 'changed', 'well', 'mainly', 'result', 'transformation', 'come', 'realize', 'Jamie', 'Landon', 'love', 'true', 'Jamie', 'way', 'far', 'superior', 'own', 'Jamie', 'father', 'also', 'important', 'lessons', 'daughter', 'thus', 'own', 'happiness', 'worthwhile', 'have', 'faith', 'someone', 'who', 'haschanged', 'better', 'Landon', 'relationship', 'estranged', 'father', 'also', 'reversed', 'result', 'Jamie', 'influence', 'other', 'words', 'Landon', 'transformation', 'chain', 'reaction', 'almost', 'characters', 'movie', 'being', 'ultimately', 'attributed', 'influence', 'positive', 'attitude', 'one', 'very', 'special', 'young', 'are', 'many', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'young', 'people', 'film', 'only', 'hope', 'many', 'will', 'see', 'let', 'message', 'help', 'change', 'attitudes', 'lives', 'minimum', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'many', 'young', 'people', 'be', 'profoundly', 'affected', 'film', 'was.My', 'congratulations', 'Director', 'Adam', 'Shankman', 'principal', 'players', 'Mandy', 'Moore', 'Shane', 'West', 'Peter', 'Coyote', 'Daryl', 'Hannah', 'superb', 'jobs', 'did', 'making', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'are', 'few', 'changes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'movie', 'make', 'more', 'accurate', 'professional', 'astronomer', 'changes', 'are', 'related', 'Jamie', 'interest', 'astronomy', 'telescopes.1', 'Jamie', 'line', 'Pluto', 'should', 'be', 'extended', 'read', 'Pluto', 'few', 'minutes', 'Sun', 'magnitude', '14', 'too', 'faint', 'be', 'seen', 'small', 'telescope', 'anyway', 'When', 'have', 'larger', 'telescope', 'will', 'be', 'possible', 'see', 'Pluto.', '2', 'line', 'building', 'larger', 'telescope', 'see', 'Comet', 'Hyakutake', 'next', 'Spring', 'word', 'return', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'omitted', 'comet', 'was', 'first-time', 'visitor', 'outer', 'Solar', 'System', 'least', 'recorded', 'history', 'Comets', 'are', 'usually', 'discovered', 'known', 'become', 'bright', 'far', 'reach', 'inner', 'Solar', 'System', 'where', 'can', 'see', 'clearly.3', 'can', 'imagine', 'Director', 'felt', 'star', 'naming', 'business', 'added', 'romantic', 'touch', 'story', 'practice', 'scam', 'been', 'strongly', 'discouraged', 'International', 'Astronomical', 'Union', 'world', 'organization', 'professional', 'astronomers', 'Perhaps', 'gift', 'similar', 'lines', 'such', 'Comet', 'Hyakutake', 'necklace', 'pendant', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate']",N/A
