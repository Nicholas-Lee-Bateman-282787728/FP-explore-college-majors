Plays are intrigueing..the petrified forest,joan of arc ,we're no angels ,visit to a small planet were all famous plays turned into vehicles for stars and for that reason are uneven. They are talky since little action takes place..all there is is dialogue like filmed dialogue. In this case,this vehicle seems to have been lined up for Martin by his well intentioned agent who tried to turn him into a more artistic performer and take him away from rat pat films,took a critical drubbing. It was not a commercial success either. The film revolves more around the young lady and her loves and relationship with her mother,so Martin's character disappears at times for much of the film. His performance is good,but you cant expect him to perform like a new york trained stage actor,and new york critics often disparaged these movie stars,and they often are stars and not always finely tuned actors,but that's not necessarily true. It is a very artsy type film,like most movies that have a stage source are,and although critics were not happy with the casting,it's a good film. Often in our minds we are used to seeing people/performers in other roles and venues,and have problems changing our focus but that's our problem not the way the peformer approaches the part. Due to the critical drubbing he received for his part,and the lack of success,martin refused this type of film in the future..the film has many good lines. One of the best near its end is Martin's character saying ""dont think but trust""...which makes us think whether she actually loved his character or thinks,she does,and it is an intelligent film,from lilian hellman..about the loves of a young woman and how they become complicated and enmeshed in all kinds of ways in modern life.

The performances alone are worth getting it for your collection - that is, if you're still watching a old CRT Analog TV model. But in this day and age where most of us have Wide Flat Screens it is downright highway robbery to charge any amount of money over a dollar for an image that occupies a narrow strip in the center of a big black 55' screen. There is no indication on the product page about it. I'm used to buying these DVD-Roms from other studios in their full wide screen ANAMORPHIC aspect ratio, so I was completely dissappointed to realize this picture was just a tiny slot on my large screen, and that I would have to ""blow-it-up"" to a rather pale and soft image, before it would play the way it was intended to look on a flat screen. Well, yes, it says so on the back of the DVD box: FULL SCREEN (meaning it is presented in the Panavision 2:35 aspect ratio, but formatted for a 4X3 TV screen). And shame to MGM for releasing this powerful drama in such a callous way and for their gall to ask such an outrageous price for what should be a budget release. This ploy was also this studios' practice a few years ago for their regular DVD releases of their United Artists films, including The Misfits and Kiss Me Deadly, which, in order to enjoy in their correct anamorphic format, one has to buy them in their Blu-Ray DVD releases.

When he finally comes into money, it sets of a chain of events that leaves his family in shambles.  Martin is good in his role, revealing what a capable actor he was.  As his sisters, Geraldine Page and Wendy Hiller deliver their usual excellent performances.  Page was especially adept at playing such complicated women, while Hiller quietly let's us in on all that her character is thinking.  Yvette Mimieux does a good job as Martin's desperate young wife, and an older Gene Tierney is very good as her detached mother.

321696,A1O42HTIVMHVD9,6302593204,Movie Man,"[9, 16]","The performances by Dean Martin, Geraldine Page, and Wendy Hiller are all top-notch, and they make this movie a good rainy afternoon entertainment.  There is also the beautiful black and white cinematography that always shows off New Orleans well.  But as my title for this review suggests, this movie aspires to hit a target but misses.  I don't know the original play, so I don't know if the problem lies in  the censorship of the early 1960s that sometimes afflicted ""spicey"" plays making the transition to the screen.  Given some of the movie's theme's, however, I wouldn't be surprised if part of the film's weakness stems from the facat that key plot and thematic developments were made obscure so as not to offend audiences of a more ""sensitive"" era.Now to the problems.  To begin with, Yvette Mimieux's character makes no sense.  Mimieux is rich, beautiful and sexy, and she is deeply in-love with Dean Martin's character.  Why would any man NOT be interested in her?  Martin's character, however, can barely stand her.  Late in the movie, it is suggested that Mimieux is a dim bulb, but we go through most of the movie not seeing any indication of this.  She seems entirely desireable, so the fact that Martin has to be bribed to marry her makes no sense.  Unless there is more to her story than we are allowed to see.  IN any case, casting someone other than the va-va-va-voom Mimieux would certainly have helped with the character's credibility.Why would Gene Tierney, Mimieux's mother, have to pay someone to marry her child?  To get the child off her hands?  Plausible, but there is nothing on screen to suggest this.  And why, as a rich and socially prominent matron, would she pay low-life Dean Martin to take up the burden?  Is the bribery necessary because white Tierney is keeping company with a black man in the highly segregated South?  This is a possibility, but that explanation is not made clear. We don't know how long Tierney's interracial daliance has lasted, and we don't know if it came about after Mimieux left the home---in which case, the daliance would not have affected Mimieux' marriage prospects. [And how did rich, white Tierney get publically involved with a black man in the New Orleans of that era?  Certainly such relationships were possible then, but they were highly improbable.  We are given none of the context underlying their relationship.]Towards the film's end, when Mimieux's desperate act has caused Martin to lose all prospects, he explains to Mimieux that the ""other woman"" who has been Mimieux' obsession only cared about helping Martin and Mimieux establish a life together.  What??  This is either a bold-face lie designed to help the dim bulb feel better about herself or ""the other woman"" is very odd.  In any case, the explanation makes no sense in the context in which it is offered.  After the assualt that he has just suffered, Martin should be angry at Mimieux;  it is wildly unlikely that he would tell her a lie to protect her sensibilities.Finally, at the end of the film when Martin finally understands the sickness underlying his relationship with his sisters, he seems determined to go back to Mimieux.  Why?  If he is at the end of his rope, without money or hope, why is he going back to a woman that he never loved?  Why not go back to the ""other woman,"" whom he really cared for?  At this point, why is he falling back into bourgeois propriety?The movie is a mess, but the performances allow you to overlook the fact that the story makes no sense.",3,There's something not quite on target here,1170806400,"02 7, 2007",2007,3519,"['performances', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'are', 'top-notch', 'make', 'movie', 'good', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'entertainment', 'also', 'beautiful', 'black', 'white', 'cinematography', 'always', 'off', 'New', 'Orleans', 'well', 'title', 'review', 'movie', 'hit', 'target', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'original', 'play', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'problem', 'censorship', 'early', '1960s', 'sometimes', 'afflicted', 'spicey', 'plays', 'making', 'transition', 'screen', 'Given', 'movie', 'theme', 'however', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'part', 'film', 'weakness', 'facat', 'key', 'plot', 'thematic', 'developments', 'were', 'made', 'obscure', 'so', 'not', 'offend', 'audiences', 'more', 'sensitive', 'era.Now', 'problems', 'begin', 'Yvette', 'Mimieux', 'character', 'sense', 'Mimieux', 'rich', 'beautiful', 'sexy', 'deeply', 'in-love', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'character', 'Why', 'would', 'man', 'NOT', 'be', 'interested', 'Martin', 'character', 'however', 'can', 'barely', 'stand', 'Late', 'movie', 'suggested', 'Mimieux', 'dim', 'bulb', 'go', 'most', 'movie', 'not', 'seeing', 'indication', 'entirely', 'desireable', 'fact', 'Martin', 'be', 'bribed', 'marry', 'sense', 'more', 'story', 'are', 'allowed', 'see', 'IN', 'case', 'casting', 'someone', 'other', 'va-va-va-voom', 'Mimieux', 'would', 'certainly', 'have', 'helped', 'character', 'credibility.Why', 'would', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'Mimieux', 'mother', 'have', 'pay', 'someone', 'marry', 'child', 'get', 'child', 'hands', 'Plausible', 'nothing', 'screen', 'suggest', 'why', 'rich', 'socially', 'prominent', 'matron', 'would', 'pay', 'low-life', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'take', 'up', 'burden', 'bribery', 'necessary', 'white', 'Tierney', 'keeping', 'company', 'black', 'man', 'highly', 'segregated', 'South', 'possibility', 'explanation', 'not', 'made', 'clear', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'long', 'Tierney', 'interracial', 'daliance', 'lasted', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'came', 'about', 'Mimieux', 'left', 'home', '-in', 'case', 'daliance', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'affected', 'Mimieux', 'marriage', 'prospects', '[', 'how', 'did', 'rich', 'white', 'Tierney', 'get', 'publically', 'involved', 'black', 'man', 'New', 'Orleans', 'era', 'Certainly', 'such', 'relationships', 'were', 'possible', 'then', 'were', 'highly', 'improbable', 'are', 'given', 'none', 'context', 'underlying', 'relationship', ']', 'film', 'end', 'when', 'Mimieux', 'desperate', 'act', 'caused', 'Martin', 'lose', 'prospects', 'Mimieux', 'other', 'woman', 'who', 'been', 'Mimieux', 'obsession', 'only', 'cared', 'helping', 'Martin', 'Mimieux', 'establish', 'life', 'together', 'What', 'bold-face', 'lie', 'designed', 'help', 'dim', 'bulb', 'feel', 'better', 'other', 'woman', 'very', 'odd', 'case', 'explanation', 'sense', 'context', 'offered', 'assualt', 'just', 'suffered', 'Martin', 'should', 'be', 'angry', 'Mimieux', 'wildly', 'unlikely', 'would', 'tell', 'lie', 'protect', 'sensibilities.Finally', 'end', 'film', 'when', 'Martin', 'finally', 'sickness', 'underlying', 'relationship', 'sisters', 'determined', 'go', 'back', 'Mimieux', 'Why', 'end', 'rope', 'money', 'hope', 'why', 'going', 'back', 'woman', 'never', 'loved', 'Why', 'not', 'go', 'back', 'other', 'woman', 'whom', 'really', 'cared', 'point', 'why', 'falling', 'back', 'bourgeois', 'propriety', 'movie', 'mess', 'performances', 'allow', 'overlook', 'fact', 'story', 'sense']",Toys in the Attic VHS

One reviewer said this was cut to 90 minutes after it's release, but still, it's a tight well edited drama with an amazing cast, and I was thoroughly engrossed by the drama, and acting.It's a welcome addition to my library.",5,Indeed Widescreen,1313712000,"08 19, 2011",2011,599,"['just', 'viewed', 'DVD', 'purchased', 'here', 'Amazon', '2010', 'DVD', 'release', 'transfer', 'quite', 'good', 'certainly', 'WIDESCREEN', 'stated', 'product', 'description', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'kind', 'editions', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'talking', 'was', 'not', 'DVD', 'great.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'got', 'see', '2', 'hour', 'version', 'film', 'One', 'reviewer', 'said', 'was', 'cut', '90', 'minutes', 'release', 'still', 'tight', 'well', 'edited', 'drama', 'amazing', 'cast', 'was', 'thoroughly', 'engrossed', 'drama', 'acting.It', 'welcome', 'addition', 'library']",Toys in the Attic VHS

He was believeable. But Geraldine Page always took the cake and more. That lady knew she had her roles down pat. On one hand, I wanted to shake that young Yvette Mimeaux,and tell her to go and get some self esteem and a back bone. Always going behind her husband's back and believing any little thing folk told her. All in all, a good movie.",5,Something Else,1073260800,"01 5, 2004",2004,459,"['got', 'see', 'movie', 'Cable', 'Saturday', 'evening', 'taping', 'yes', 'was', 'good', 'performance', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'was', 'believeable', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'always', 'took', 'cake', 'more', 'lady', 'knew', 'had', 'roles', 'down', 'pat', 'one', 'hand', 'wanted', 'shake', 'young', 'Yvette', 'Mimeaux', 'tell', 'go', 'get', 'self', 'esteem', 'back', 'bone', 'going', 'husband', 'back', 'believing', 'little', 'thing', 'folk', 'told', 'good', 'movie']",Toys in the Attic VHS

Lynch ""vtl""","[9, 12]","I have enjoyed this film since I was a kid and first caught it on television a couple of years after I really became aware of Dean Martin when he hit big with ""Everybody Loves Somebody"" and his television show.  Of course, it was highly censored at that time on regular television, and so it wasn't until the third or fourth time I saw it that I realized the real meaning of Carrie's feelings toward her brother.  I was stunned to realize she had incestuous feelings toward him, but today I realize even more what a fine film this really is.  Yes, I watched it for Dino, and despite what critics at the time said, I still think he does a fantastic acting job here (we tend to forget about some his early solo film performances -- ""Rio Bravo"", ""Some Came Running"" -- and just how good he could be at acting when he really worked at it.  But I also love this film for the performances of Wendy Hiller and Geraldine Page.  Page always gets the most attention, and she certainly plays her mentally ill sister character to the hilt in this film, but I admire even more Hiller's understated performance as the sister who knows more than she usually says and is actually the rock of the family.  Another treat is Gene Tierney, back for one of her final films after her nervous breakdown.  Perhaps the only Lillian Hellman (author) film I admire more is ""The Childrens' Hour"" with Shirley MacLaine and Audrey Hepburn.  ""Toys In The Attic"" is serious stuff, and not for the moralists, but it's a film I always enjoy immensely, and most of all for the strength of its performances.",5,I Disagree With The Critics,1284595200,"09 16, 2010",2010,1571,"['have', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'was', 'kid', 'first', 'caught', 'television', 'couple', 'years', 'really', 'became', 'aware', 'Dean', 'Martin', 'when', 'hit', 'big', 'Everybody', 'Somebody', 'television', 'show', 'course', 'was', 'highly', 'censored', 'time', 'regular', 'television', 'was', ""n't"", 'third', 'fourth', 'time', 'saw', 'realized', 'real', 'meaning', 'Carrie', 'feelings', 'brother', 'was', 'stunned', 'realize', 'had', 'incestuous', 'feelings', 'today', 'realize', 'even', 'more', 'what', 'fine', 'film', 'really', 'Yes', 'watched', 'Dino', 'what', 'critics', 'time', 'said', 'still', 'think', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'job', 'here', 'tend', 'forget', 'early', 'solo', 'film', 'performances', 'Rio', 'Bravo', 'Came', 'Running', 'just', 'how', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'acting', 'when', 'really', 'worked', 'also', 'love', 'film', 'performances', 'Wendy', 'Hiller', 'Geraldine', 'Page', 'Page', 'always', 'most', 'attention', 'certainly', 'mentally', 'ill', 'sister', 'character', 'hilt', 'film', 'admire', 'even', 'more', 'Hiller', 'understated', 'performance', 'sister', 'who', 'more', 'usually', 'actually', 'rock', 'family', 'treat', 'Gene', 'Tierney', 'back', 'one', 'final', 'films', 'nervous', 'breakdown', 'Perhaps', 'only', 'Lillian', 'Hellman', 'author', 'film', 'admire', 'more', 'Childrens', 'Hour', 'Shirley', 'MacLaine', 'Audrey', 'Hepburn', 'Toys', 'Attic', 'serious', 'stuff', 'not', 'moralists', 'film', 'always', 'enjoy', 'immensely', 'most', 'strength', 'performances']",Toys in the Attic VHS
