I have all seven of the series and I love the series very much, so I am quite sure I will be rating the season eight with a 5 star as well.  I do feel that being asked to rate a series that hasn't been released yet is unfair.

1379234,AL1WBEKIEPUPE,B0040GOS1W,"GEORGE RANNIE ""GWRJWMCL""","[5, 5]","It is my understanding that there is only going to be one more season of ""Waking the Dead"" which makes me very sad, I've grown to love this series with its very intense stories and characters--such great acting, direction and stories.  Season Eight (8) certainly has all of the aforesaid attributes that has caused me to adore this series.  Once again, in Season Eight (8) Boyd, as leader of a brilliant British ""cold case"" team, solve some very intense and frightening cases that have gone ""cold"" but with ""tie ins"" with current murders.  Boyd is still very ""short-fused"" which leads to many battles with his team--the psychologist Grace (wonderfully acted by Sue Johnston) , the very good detective and sexy Spence (greatly acted by Will Johnson), other detectives and a pathologist.  All of the members of the ""Cold Case"" team are more than willing to go ""toe to toe"" with their leader Boyd when they disagree with his ""methods"" in solving  a case.  Those heated battles are the prime reason I have admired this series for so long.  Season 8 is filled with those ""battles"" involving the lost of a team member and also featuring the pathologist Eve--the actress that plays pathologist Eve truly gives  an overwhelming performance in one story really proving that she is a superb actress. In that two part episode,  Spence (as acted by Will Johnson) also shines as an actor!Yes, there are only four (4) episodes that run about an hour and forty minutes each in Season Eight (8) instead of the usual six (6).  However, because this season is so superbly written, directed and acted, I was greatly entertained.",5,Wonderfully intense Season,1382745600,"10 26, 2013",2013,1609,"['understanding', 'only', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'more', 'season', 'Waking', 'Dead', 'very', 'sad', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'love', 'series', 'very', 'intense', 'stories', 'characters', 'such', 'great', 'acting', 'direction', 'stories', 'Season', 'Eight', '8', 'certainly', 'aforesaid', 'caused', 'adore', 'series', 'Once', 'again', 'Season', 'Eight', '8', 'Boyd', 'leader', 'brilliant', 'British', 'cold', 'case', 'team', 'solve', 'very', 'intense', 'frightening', 'cases', 'have', 'gone', 'cold', 'tie', 'ins', 'current', 'murders', 'Boyd', 'still', 'very', 'short-fused', 'many', 'battles', 'team', 'psychologist', 'Grace', 'wonderfully', 'acted', 'Sue', 'Johnston', 'very', 'good', 'detective', 'sexy', 'Spence', 'greatly', 'acted', 'Will', 'Johnson', 'other', 'detectives', 'pathologist', 'members', 'Cold', 'Case', 'team', 'are', 'more', 'willing', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'leader', 'Boyd', 'when', 'disagree', 'methods', 'solving', 'case', 'heated', 'battles', 'are', 'prime', 'reason', 'have', 'admired', 'series', 'so', 'long', 'Season', '8', 'filled', 'battles', 'involving', 'lost', 'team', 'member', 'also', 'featuring', 'pathologist', 'Eve', 'actress', 'pathologist', 'Eve', 'truly', 'overwhelming', 'performance', 'one', 'story', 'really', 'proving', 'superb', 'actress', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'Spence', 'acted', 'Will', 'Johnson', 'also', 'actor', 'Yes', 'are', 'only', 'four', '4', 'run', 'hour', 'forty', 'minutes', 'Season', 'Eight', '8', 'instead', 'usual', 'six', '6', 'However', 'season', 'so', 'superbly', 'written', 'directed', 'acted', 'was', 'greatly', 'entertained']",N/A

It is thoughtful and intelligent.  Series 8 and it final season 9 are excellent.  I have seen the UK versions of it.  The criticism is not the content or the series, but release schedule for a series that already completed.  Come on.  Finish the releases and the series.

1379237,A16XRPF40679KG,B0040GOS1W,Michael Dobey,"[0, 1]","I have always been a huge fan of this show. Of course we all watch it because of the lead actor in it. His character is very abrasive and abusive to his coworkers , but they love him and they know he's a good man.  This season was 8 eps long and we get it on standard dvd here. It was shown in hd in the uk. WHy we can't get more uk shows on American tv is beyond me.  It's a good way for a network to get good programing and fill in gaps when other shows are not on.  Still this one is now gone , so it's a moot point. this one is from 2009. And we get a return of the evil mastermind serial killer , who is a female no less; and quite a good villain. One of the eps was weak in my opinion. And it is probably the weakest in the history of the show. It's about body parts selling.  But it's still a good ep; as this show never made a bad ep imo it is just weak for this great show.. Still for some it may leave a bad taste in their mouth because of the ending.  THe rest of the show are typical two parters and fit into the waking the dead mode.  There's one more series left to come out on this hit show which could have lasted more years , but tt's network cancelled it due to their desire to put new shows on. regardless of the fact that this was a hit for 11 years. (two of which had no shows on though).  On dvd looks as good as tit can in spite of the fact it was shot in hd.  There are NO extras , but for many of these tv shows from the uk , that's normal. At least we get to see them finally.",5,"one series left to go , this was a show still making great tv.",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2013,1502,"['have', 'always', 'been', 'huge', 'fan', 'show', 'course', 'watch', 'lead', 'actor', 'character', 'very', 'abrasive', 'abusive', 'coworkers', 'love', 'know', 'good', 'man', 'season', 'was', '8', 'eps', 'long', 'get', 'standard', 'dvd', 'here', 'was', 'shown', 'hd', 'uk', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'uk', 'shows', 'American', 'tv', 'good', 'way', 'network', 'get', 'good', 'programing', 'fill', 'gaps', 'when', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'Still', 'one', 'now', 'gone', 'moot', 'point', 'one', '2009', 'get', 'return', 'evil', 'mastermind', 'serial', 'killer', 'who', 'female', 'less', 'quite', 'good', 'villain', 'One', 'eps', 'was', 'weak', 'opinion', 'probably', 'weakest', 'history', 'show', 'body', 'parts', 'selling', 'still', 'good', 'ep', 'show', 'never', 'made', 'bad', 'ep', 'imo', 'just', 'weak', 'great', 'show..', 'Still', 'may', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'ending', 'THe', 'rest', 'show', 'are', 'typical', 'two', 'parters', 'fit', 'waking', 'dead', 'mode', 'one', 'more', 'series', 'left', 'come', 'out', 'hit', 'show', 'could', 'have', 'lasted', 'more', 'years', 'tt', 'network', 'cancelled', 'due', 'desire', 'put', 'new', 'shows', 'regardless', 'fact', 'was', 'hit', '11', 'years', 'two', 'had', 'shows', 'dvd', 'looks', 'as', 'good', 'tit', 'can', 'spite', 'fact', 'was', 'shot', 'hd', 'are', 'NO', 'extras', 'many', 'tv', 'shows', 'uk', 'normal', 'least', 'get', 'see', 'finally']",N/A
