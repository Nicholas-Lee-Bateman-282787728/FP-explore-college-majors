At last, I decided to give it a try and was delighted by the witty dialogue, the marvelous set-ups and the back-and-forth between the very talented leads.To anyone who wants to try this series but is not sure, it is marvelous. From the first bars of the catchy theme song (which gets stuck in your head) I was totally in love. The comedic style reminded me of the screwball comedies of the 1930s, the era in which this series is set.A must for Anglophiles, fans of older comedy and people looking for good, clean humor.My favorite episode is the first one but every episode in the set in a minor comic masterpiece.

Both actors were 17 years younger and both were well suited to their respective roles. ""Silly [...]"" Bertie Wooster is a gangling, Eton educated, wealthy young man about town in the thirties in London and around the English countryside and he and his equally foggy cronies amuse themselves with sport, drinking and ""getting up to great wheezes"" which often involve baiting the members of the constabulary and ending up in front of the magistrate. Super suave, intelligent Jeeves is the perfect valet with immaculate taste and far more brain power than Bertie and his chums and is more often than not, the means of getting them out of scrapes.

There are some laughs.  But there is much hostile humor here, and Wodehouse's comedy is typically good-natured, feel-good comedy, as it is uniformly in Wodehouse Playhouse.Also, Wodehouse's women are as odd and as funny as his men, but today they would be politically incorrect.  The screenwriter here obviously removed all the political incorrectness from these women but did not put any characterization in its place.  The result is blah, boring women characters.Wodehouse started the Mulliner stories twenty years after he started the Jeeves series.  Maybe he'd learned a thing or two.Also, of course, it is hard to equal Pauline Collins and John Alderton.Bottom line: if you haven't seen either series, Wodehouse Playhouse is a much better bet.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[22, 23]","It's only fitting that one of the best British comedy series out there is adapted from some of the funniest novels ever written. Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry expertly fill in the ditzy aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his stoic ultra-brain manservant Jeeves. Hilarious writing, great casting, insanely complicated storylines that make ""Seinfeld"" look like a walk in the part.""Jeeves Takes Charge"" when Bertram Wilberforce Wooster advertises for a new valet (the old one kept stealing his socks). As Bertie becomes accustomed to Jeeves, he is also being sent to the country to (theoretically) woo Honoria Glossop, a woman so hearty and athletic that she slaps Bertie right off his feet. To make things more complicated, one of Bertie's pals is in love with Honoria, and Bertie's two crazy cousins are stealing stuff.""Tuppy and the Terrier"" includes Bertie planning to propose to the mischievous Bobbie Wickham, a move that rapidly gets him into hot water (specifically, a hot water bottle punctured by a needle) -- but not as much hot water as he'll be in when Aunt Agatha finds out that Bobbie gave away her beloved dog. Meanwhile, Bertie's pal Tuppy Glossop has fallen in love with a snooty opera singer and dumped Bertie's cousin...""The Purity of the Turf"" is soiled when Bertie's uncle falls in love with a waittress. Aunt Agatha's orders that Bertie bribe the girl away work -- and don't work -- and the resulting threat of imminent death sends Bertie and Jeeves into the countryside. There they start up a gambling syndicate at a fete where betting of all kinds is off-limits.""Brinkley Manor""'s ""Hunger Strike"" goes horribly wrong when Bertie's cousin Angela breaks up with Tuppy, and newt-obsessed Gussie Fink-Nottle falls in love with the soppy Madeleine Basset (she believes the stars are God's daisy chain -- how about that?). Bertie offers advice to the lovelorn young men, only to have Madeleine assume that he is in love with her, and Tuppy assumes that he is in love with Angela. Anatole the cook also quits. And Jeeves is Bertie's last hope. before Madeleine marries him and Aunt Dahlia murders him.P.G. Wodehouse's novels spoof the idle rich, and you may come out of it thankful that these people had too much time on their hands. Timid young men, carnivorous aunts, a guy obsessed with newts, another guy who falls in love with every girl he comes across, a stuffed moose, uncles in the throes of midlife crises, incredibly smart butlers, and young women who accept a marriage proposal that was never made -- if anything here strikes you as funny, this will be perfect. Hugh Laurie is perfect as the gangly, amiable Bertie Wooster (who's too accomodating for his own good) and Stephen Fry is quietly, dryly humorous as the opinionated valet Jeeves.Though this season suffers from a few awkward spots that are polished out later in the series, this show is outrageously funny and definitely worth buying!",5,The best of British comedy,1040947200,"12 27, 2002",2002,2915,"['only', 'fitting', 'one', 'best', 'British', 'comedy', 'series', 'adapted', 'funniest', 'novels', 'ever', 'written', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'expertly', 'ditzy', 'aristocrat', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'stoic', 'ultra-brain', 'manservant', 'Jeeves', 'Hilarious', 'writing', 'great', 'casting', 'insanely', 'complicated', 'storylines', 'make', 'Seinfeld', 'look', 'walk', 'part', 'Takes', 'Charge', 'when', 'Bertram', 'Wilberforce', 'Wooster', 'new', 'valet', 'old', 'one', 'kept', 'stealing', 'socks', 'Bertie', 'accustomed', 'Jeeves', 'also', 'being', 'sent', 'country', 'theoretically', 'woo', 'Honoria', 'Glossop', 'woman', 'so', 'hearty', 'athletic', 'slaps', 'Bertie', 'right', 'off', 'feet', 'make', 'things', 'more', 'complicated', 'one', 'Bertie', 'pals', 'love', 'Honoria', 'Bertie', 'two', 'crazy', 'cousins', 'are', 'stealing', 'stuff', 'Tuppy', 'Terrier', 'Bertie', 'planning', 'propose', 'mischievous', 'Bobbie', 'Wickham', 'move', 'rapidly', 'hot', 'water', 'specifically', 'hot', 'water', 'bottle', 'punctured', 'needle', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'hot', 'water', ""'ll"", 'be', 'when', 'Aunt', 'Agatha', 'out', 'Bobbie', 'gave', 'away', 'beloved', 'dog', 'Meanwhile', 'Bertie', 'pal', 'Tuppy', 'Glossop', 'fallen', 'love', 'snooty', 'opera', 'singer', 'dumped', 'Bertie', 'cousin', 'Purity', 'Turf', 'soiled', 'when', 'Bertie', 'uncle', 'love', 'waittress', 'Aunt', 'Agatha', 'orders', 'Bertie', 'bribe', 'girl', 'away', 'work', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'resulting', 'threat', 'imminent', 'death', 'sends', 'Bertie', 'Jeeves', 'countryside', 'start', 'up', 'gambling', 'syndicate', 'fete', 'where', 'betting', 'kinds', 'off-limits', 'Brinkley', 'Manor', 'Hunger', 'Strike', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'when', 'Bertie', 'cousin', 'Angela', 'up', 'Tuppy', 'newt-obsessed', 'Gussie', 'Fink-Nottle', 'love', 'soppy', 'Madeleine', 'Basset', 'stars', 'are', 'God', 'daisy', 'chain', 'how', 'Bertie', 'advice', 'lovelorn', 'young', 'men', 'only', 'have', 'Madeleine', 'assume', 'love', 'Tuppy', 'love', 'Angela', 'Anatole', 'cook', 'also', 'Jeeves', 'Bertie', 'last', 'hope', 'Madeleine', 'Aunt', 'Dahlia', 'murders', 'him.P.G', 'Wodehouse', 'novels', 'spoof', 'idle', 'rich', 'may', 'come', 'people', 'had', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'hands', 'Timid', 'young', 'men', 'carnivorous', 'aunts', 'guy', 'obsessed', 'newts', 'guy', 'who', 'love', 'girl', 'across', 'stuffed', 'moose', 'uncles', 'throes', 'midlife', 'crises', 'incredibly', 'smart', 'butlers', 'young', 'women', 'who', 'accept', 'marriage', 'proposal', 'was', 'never', 'made', 'anything', 'here', 'funny', 'will', 'be', 'perfect', 'Hugh', 'Laurie', 'perfect', 'gangly', 'amiable', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'who', 'too', 'accomodating', 'own', 'good', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'quietly', 'dryly', 'humorous', 'opinionated', 'valet', 'Jeeves.Though', 'season', 'few', 'awkward', 'spots', 'are', 'polished', 'out', 'later', 'series', 'show', 'outrageously', 'funny', 'definitely', 'worth', 'buying']",The Very First Jeeves & Wooster VHS

506657,A3QAQUUPFIARWB,B00000JMQ5,"Gord Wilson ""alivingdog.com""","[1, 1]","Readers who have seen my Amazon review of PGW's French Leave know I am an incurable fan of the Master. Here I will merely make some notes on the DVDs of the Jeeves and Wooster series, since other readers have already reviewed them so well. Since the TV episodes do not have titles, the shows appeared on video under various names, which made for mix-ups, and you could easily have bought the same show twice. This was particularly the case in the transition from the Masterpiece Theatre/PBS editions to the A&E; sets. To make matters worse, A&E; also retitled the sets variously, so you never knew what you were buying.The DVDs are at least grouped by seasons. In the first season on VHS, the five shows,""Jeeves Arrival,"" ""Golf Tournament,"" The Gambling Event,"" ""Hunger Strike"" and ""The Matchmaker,"" also appeared as: ""Jeeves Takes Charge,"" ""The Purity of the Turf,"" ""Tuppy and the Terrier,"" ""The Hunger Strike,"" and ""Brinkley Manor."" The A&E; boxed VHS set is called ""The Very First Jeeves and Wooster.""The Second Season in VHS consisted of ""Jeeves Saves the Cow Creamer,"" ""A Plan for Gussie,"" ""Pearls Mean Tears,"" ""Kidnapped,"" and ""Jeeves the Matchmaker."" The Third Season on VHS was called ""More Jeeves and Wooster,"" and included ""Bertie Sets Sail,"" ""The Full House,"" Introduction on Broadway,"" ""Hot Off the Press,"" ""Comrade Bingo,"" and ""Right Ho Jeeves.""

The fourth season departs too far from PGW's style to please longtime Wodehousians, but some viewers unfamiliar with Plum's books might like the faster pace better.This retitling problem occurs with P.G.Wodehouse's books also, since the American editions were often renamed from the British versions, different short story collections were variously titled, etc. etc. In his book, P.G.Wodehouse, in the Thames and Hudson Literary Lives series, Joseph Connolly gives a listing of duplicate books with different titles.

Wodehouse fanatics (and there are a lot of them) seem to embrace the show with enthusiasm. I'm writing to tell you that you don't have to know the canon to love the TV version.Stephen Fry (Jeeves) and Hugh Laurie (Wooster) are well-known English comedians. They both had major roles in the Blackadder series and Laurie starred in Stuart Little. Here, Laurie plays Bertie Wooster, an air-headed young English aristocrat, a character exactly like his Blackadder roles, and Fry plays Jeeves, Bertie's valet, a man of sophistication and cunning, equally at home in the sitting room of a county manor or in a rowdy East End mission. A character completely unlike any Fry played in Blackadder.The series is set in the 1930's, and is rich with period atmosphere. Poor addled Bertie may be rich, debauched and carefree, but he forever seems to be getting into social trouble with either his aunts or his eccentric school chums. The punch line every time is that, after Bertie has made such a pig's breakfast of things that you can't imagine he'll ever be invited to anyone's mansion for dinner again, Jeeves comes up with a simple and elegant resolution. Along the way, we are treated to crisp, witty dialog, in the best British tradition. I particularly enjoyed Jeeves's reaction to the mess jacket he finds in Bertie's clothes closet:""I assumed it had gotten into your wardrobe by accident...or else been placed there by your enemies.""Bertie protests. ""I wore this jacket at Cannes, Jeeves, and all the young ladies tried to catch my eye.""""No doubt they mistook you for a waiter, sir.""The striking thing about this series (unlike, say, Blackadder) is that it will keep you laughing without the slightest sexual innuendo or a smidgeon of violence (unless you count Bertie's golf game). You could show this whole series at a Sunday School picnic and no one would blush.How many comedies can you say *that* about?",5,"No sex, no violence, hilarious!

506675,AR1T36GLLAFFX,B00000JMQ5,Scott FS,"[6, 6]","P.G. Wodehouse wrote some of the most beloved stories in the twentieth century, including dozens of short stories and a number of novels of probably his most famous characters, the fopish Bertie Wooster and his brilliant valet, Reginald Jeeves.  Those stories were the basis of this wonderful collection of episodes in the first season of Jeeves and Wooster.Set in Bertie's flat in London and various other locales around England, including the wonderfully named Drone's Club, the episodes revolve around Jeeve's always successful machinations that rescue Bertie from one scrape or another, frequently involving real or imagined relationships with a variety of mainly unsuitable women who travel in the same upperclass world as does Bertie.  Bertie is indeed doubly lucky; first, to be born to wealth, allowing his ineptitude to do no real damage to himself or others, and secondly, to aquire the services of his valet, Jeeves, whose cleverness is the epitome of the helpful servant.Hugh Laurie, now quite well-known as Dr. House on the highly-regarded Fox network medical drama 'House', plays Bertie with a knack for physical comedy and a wide range of facial expression that perfectly convey the emotions of a man totally at the mercy of strong-willed women, particularly his aunts and a variety of young marriagable women.  Bertie sees no need to ever marry, since he has a wide circle of hilariously-named friends called Bingo and Gussy Finklenottle.Wodehouse obviously loved to tweak the noses of the totally clueless upperclass members of British society.  We see the extremely large houses where the aristocrats lived; thanks to Wodehouse we can safely laugh at their foolishness.Wodehouse's humor is definitely British, physical, and simply wonderful.  I have purchased this set and all the other episodes of Jeeves and Wooster, and I've watched them several times.  I'm happy to report that they hold up extremely well to repeated viewing.Highly recommended; five stars.  The quality of the pictures and sound are fine with no apparent problems with transfers.",5,Delightful British Humor,1152144000,"07 6, 2006",2006,2069,"['P.G', 'Wodehouse', 'wrote', 'most', 'beloved', 'stories', 'twentieth', 'century', 'including', 'dozens', 'short', 'stories', 'number', 'novels', 'probably', 'most', 'famous', 'characters', 'fopish', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'brilliant', 'valet', 'Reginald', 'Jeeves', 'stories', 'were', 'basis', 'wonderful', 'collection', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'Jeeves', 'Wooster.Set', 'Bertie', 'flat', 'London', 'various', 'other', 'locales', 'England', 'including', 'wonderfully', 'named', 'Drone', 'Club', 'episodes', 'revolve', 'Jeeve', 'always', 'successful', 'machinations', 'rescue', 'Bertie', 'one', 'scrape', 'frequently', 'involving', 'real', 'imagined', 'relationships', 'variety', 'mainly', 'unsuitable', 'women', 'who', 'travel', 'same', 'upperclass', 'world', 'Bertie', 'Bertie', 'indeed', 'doubly', 'lucky', 'first', 'be', 'born', 'wealth', 'allowing', 'ineptitude', 'do', 'real', 'damage', 'others', 'secondly', 'aquire', 'services', 'valet', 'Jeeves', 'cleverness', 'epitome', 'helpful', 'servant.Hugh', 'Laurie', 'now', 'quite', 'well-known', 'Dr.', 'House', 'highly-regarded', 'Fox', 'network', 'medical', 'drama', ""'House"", 'Bertie', 'knack', 'physical', 'comedy', 'wide', 'range', 'facial', 'expression', 'perfectly', 'emotions', 'man', 'totally', 'mercy', 'strong-willed', 'women', 'particularly', 'aunts', 'variety', 'young', 'marriagable', 'women', 'Bertie', 'need', 'ever', 'marry', 'wide', 'circle', 'hilariously-named', 'friends', 'called', 'Bingo', 'Gussy', 'Finklenottle.Wodehouse', 'obviously', 'loved', 'tweak', 'noses', 'totally', 'clueless', 'upperclass', 'members', 'British', 'society', 'see', 'extremely', 'large', 'houses', 'where', 'aristocrats', 'lived', 'thanks', 'can', 'safely', 'laugh', 'foolishness.Wodehouse', 'humor', 'definitely', 'British', 'physical', 'simply', 'wonderful', 'have', 'purchased', 'set', 'other', 'episodes', 'Jeeves', 'Wooster', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'several', 'times', ""'m"", 'happy', 'report', 'hold', 'up', 'extremely', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewing.Highly', 'recommended', 'five', 'stars', 'quality', 'pictures', 'sound', 'are', 'fine', 'apparent', 'problems', 'transfers']",The Very First Jeeves & Wooster VHS

He just stands in front of the female newt vibrating his tail and bending his body in a semi-circle.""Hands down, this was the funniest part of the whole season one.  No, I know, it doesn't sound funny, but it's a visual thing.  Trust me, it's worth it.  I'd give the last two episodes of season one five stars, but the first three earn only three stars because, well, it's a bit of a slow-moving show.  And I'm not just talking about its lack of explosions and other CGI-eye-candy present in most movies and TV shows today (at the expense of a plot, oftentimes).  Even taking into account the style and sly, subtle humor, it took awhile to get warmed up to the characters and get into the show.There is something delightful about watching something set at such a time, though, when decorum and decency were very different.  And the men's outfits!  So dashing.  Who nowadays wears a three-piece suit to a formal event, let alone every day?  I'm sure there might be historians out there who would quibble with some piece of furniture or cut of a coat (there's always someone who finds somewhere they've slipped up!), but for the lay-person it is quite nicely done and sets the scene wonderfully.Fry and Laurie do a great job as Jeeves and Wooster, but it's really Bertie Wooster's aunts that steal the show.  Their characters are vibrant and strong (and, well, yes, a bit shrill) and provide a wonderful counter-point to Jeeves's demure intelligence and Wooster's bumbling, but cheerful, incompetence.  The cast works together marvelously, and the plot, while slightly weak and rather in the background, works with the characters.I give it only four stars because of the slow beginning, but am looking forward to the next series.",4,"Perhaps not the most romantic proposal, but it'd be unique!",1217203200,"07 28, 2008",2008,1774,"['Do', 'know', 'how', 'male', 'newt', 'proposes', 'Bertie', 'just', 'front', 'female', 'newt', 'vibrating', 'tail', 'bending', 'body', 'semi-circle', 'Hands', 'down', 'was', 'funniest', 'part', 'whole', 'season', 'one', 'No', 'know', ""n't"", 'sound', 'funny', 'visual', 'thing', 'Trust', ""'d"", 'give', 'last', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'one', 'five', 'stars', 'first', 'three', 'earn', 'only', 'three', 'stars', 'well', 'bit', 'slow-moving', 'show', ""'m"", 'not', 'just', 'talking', 'lack', 'explosions', 'other', 'CGI-eye-candy', 'present', 'most', 'movies', 'TV', 'shows', 'today', 'expense', 'plot', 'oftentimes', 'Even', 'taking', 'account', 'style', 'sly', 'subtle', 'humor', 'took', 'awhile', 'get', 'warmed', 'up', 'characters', 'get', 'show.There', 'something', 'delightful', 'watching', 'something', 'set', 'time', 'though', 'when', 'decorum', 'decency', 'were', 'very', 'different', 'men', 'outfits', 'So', 'dashing', 'Who', 'three-piece', 'suit', 'formal', 'event', 'let', 'alone', 'day', ""'m"", 'sure', 'might', 'be', 'historians', 'who', 'would', 'quibble', 'piece', 'furniture', 'cut', 'coat', 'always', 'someone', 'who', 'somewhere', ""'ve"", 'slipped', 'up', 'lay-person', 'quite', 'nicely', 'done', 'scene', 'wonderfully.Fry', 'Laurie', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'Jeeves', 'Wooster', 'really', 'Bertie', 'Wooster', 'aunts', 'steal', 'show', 'characters', 'are', 'vibrant', 'strong', 'well', 'yes', 'bit', 'shrill', 'provide', 'wonderful', 'counter-point', 'Jeeves', 'demure', 'intelligence', 'Wooster', 'bumbling', 'cheerful', 'incompetence', 'cast', 'together', 'marvelously', 'plot', 'slightly', 'weak', 'rather', 'background', 'characters.I', 'give', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'slow', 'beginning', 'am', 'looking', 'forward', 'next', 'series']",The Very First Jeeves & Wooster VHS
