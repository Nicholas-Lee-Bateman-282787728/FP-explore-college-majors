He plays the guitar in a flamenco bit, the piano and the harmonica, and his back-up band is terrific, as well as the trio of singers called The Last Chapter.This is a fast moving hour and 12 minutes...and a wonderful record of this multi-talented showman.

At first I was going to continue clicking past it when I thought it was just another episode of the Lawrence Welk show (sorry, it's just that everything looked like the Lawrence Welk show in the 70's) but then I heard Bobby sing.  He was singing a Hank Williams tune and it was just dripping with soul.  The look on the man's face, the sound of his voice, the way he moved, I could just tell that he meant every word he was singing.  I was hooked, I put the remote down and finished out the program.  Realizing that there was much that I missed, I went online and found it listed here and purchased it immediately.  I've never been sorry.  In fact, most of my DVD collection is one-time-use only but this one lives on top of the TV.Just to give a little background, I grew up on Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull and Stevie Ray Vaughan, not the sort of music a person writing a Bobby Darin review would typically listen to.  Darin's genre bending, crooner/soul tinged arrangements and fantastic backup band would make anybody a believer, no doubt!  The energy in this one is phenomenal, even more so when you learn that Bobby only lived another 9 months after this broadcast due to a severe heart condition.  In fact, he gave every bit of his heart in this one... I'm not surprised that he didn't leave enough for himself.The extras on this are good too, some clips from Bobby's own variety show, some behind the scenes stuff and a little mini film on Bobby's comeback show at the Copa.

I've been a fan for a long time, but never knew of his versatility. This program proved it.Bobby sang his heart out and moved like the best young dancers of today. He did impressions, played harmonica, guitar and piano; told jokes and bantered with his band and audience. He exudes total confidence and is a very nice piece of eye candy, to boot. Watching it, you'd have no idea that he was very sick and would succomb to his heart problem just nine months later.While I was a little disappointed in how little of his hits are showcased in this program, the versatility that he shows in performing others' material is fantastic! He puts his own spin on things and seems to be totally immersed in the music and enjoying himself.  I especially enjoyed his ""Bo Diddly"" number.Although this show was done back in 1973, the vibrant color and sound are as if it were done yesterday. I really enjoyed it.What a shame that this was Bobby's last performance which was apparently never aired. But thankfully through the power of video and DVD, fans and future fans, alike, can enjoy this remarkable performer for years to come.

185033,A5WN8L3I2CDV5,1568556888,D. Rotmil,"[16, 21]","Bobby was a bit before my time.  As a young child of the 70's I can remember the plethora of TV variety shows before the days of cable. However, I was only familiar with Darin by hearing ""Splish Splash"" during commercials tauting ""The Best of the 50's"" record compilations. So, it wasn't until his son Dodd Darin, produced a PBS special in 1998 on the life of his Dad that I understood the man and his talent.  So, I'm rather new to this Darin fandom, and have made room in my indie/alt.rock/folkie/rock Gen X-er CD collection for a bit of Bobby D (gladly next to another favorite Bobby D - Mr. Dylan.)This DVD of Bobby Darin's last TV performance (uncut) shows him during an era where polyester ruled. In fact, anyone from age 10 to 30 at that time ran for the hills at the sight of someone like Darin in his tux, bowtie and lavelier microphone.  Back then, if it didn't have denim, long hair and looked like Robert Plant - forget it. Bobby looked corny in this taping, but please - the whole 1970's were cheezy, so don't blame him for glitzying it up.  The only thing is - there was so much more to him that the glitz.  Knowing this, it's good to be open minded to the dazzle of such a performance, and just let oneself go with the Bobby flow...comb over, frills and all in this DVD. It's the style of an era long gone, and worth watching.I found this uncut variety show a hoot to watch. You see all the errors and banter that would be edited for air. Bobby was the ultimate showbiz performer with a spectacular voice, sweet face and a nice rear-end if I must say, but the performance does have some cringe inducing moments.  The chatter is fun and the songs are cool. However, when you see him try to get down and be funky, he gives comedian and comedic musicians - from Paul Schaffer to Bill Murray - fodder for their Vegas-y, showbizzy parodies.Still, he looks like he's having a blast. It's amazing how energetic and well he looked for a man who sadly had to run off stage to take a hit off an oxygen tank during live shows.  I was disappointed that he did a bit too much vamping during a gorgeous song like ""Beyond the Sea"".  I will say, his self deprecating humor and honesty with the audience was refreshing.  Too bad he didn't shed the toupe and bowtie for a more down to earth version of himself in this show. And what a shame he died so soon after. It would be wonderful to have him around today.This DVD has some nice special features of Bobby's various television appearances, film trailers and comedy sketches. So, there's more to feast on.  Bobby deserves to be remembered, and although there are some moments that don't soar, it's worthwhile to hear those golden chops, and see that smiling face one last time.",4,Nice Show - Not Perfect - But Fun,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,2727,"['Bobby', 'was', 'bit', 'time', 'young', 'child', '70', 'can', 'remember', 'plethora', 'TV', 'variety', 'days', 'cable', 'However', 'was', 'only', 'familiar', 'Darin', 'hearing', 'Splish', 'Splash', 'commercials', 'tauting', 'Best', '50', 'record', 'compilations', 'So', 'was', ""n't"", 'son', 'Dodd', 'Darin', 'produced', 'PBS', 'special', '1998', 'life', 'Dad', 'understood', 'man', 'talent', 'So', ""'m"", 'rather', 'new', 'Darin', 'fandom', 'have', 'made', 'room', 'indie/alt.rock/folkie/rock', 'Gen', 'X-er', 'CD', 'collection', 'bit', 'Bobby', 'D', 'gladly', 'next', 'favorite', 'Bobby', 'D', 'Mr', 'Dylan', 'DVD', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'last', 'TV', 'performance', 'uncut', 'era', 'where', 'polyester', 'ruled', 'fact', 'anyone', 'age', '10', '30', 'time', 'ran', 'hills', 'sight', 'someone', 'Darin', 'tux', 'bowtie', 'lavelier', 'microphone', 'Back', 'then', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'denim', 'long', 'hair', 'looked', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'forget', 'Bobby', 'looked', 'corny', 'taping', 'please', 'whole', '1970', 'were', 'cheezy', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'blame', 'glitzying', 'up', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'glitz', 'Knowing', 'good', 'be', 'open', 'minded', 'dazzle', 'such', 'performance', 'just', 'let', 'go', 'Bobby', 'flow', 'comb', 'frills', 'DVD', 'style', 'era', 'long', 'gone', 'worth', 'watching.I', 'found', 'uncut', 'variety', 'show', 'hoot', 'watch', 'see', 'errors', 'banter', 'would', 'be', 'edited', 'air', 'Bobby', 'was', 'ultimate', 'showbiz', 'performer', 'spectacular', 'voice', 'sweet', 'face', 'nice', 'rear-end', 'must', 'say', 'performance', 'have', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'moments', 'chatter', 'fun', 'songs', 'are', 'cool', 'However', 'when', 'see', 'try', 'get', 'down', 'be', 'funky', 'comedian', 'comedic', 'musicians', 'Paul', 'Schaffer', 'Bill', 'Murray', 'fodder', 'Vegas-y', 'showbizzy', 'parodies.Still', 'having', 'blast', 'amazing', 'how', 'energetic', 'well', 'looked', 'man', 'who', 'sadly', 'had', 'run', 'off', 'stage', 'take', 'hit', 'off', 'oxygen', 'tank', 'live', 'shows', 'was', 'disappointed', 'did', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'vamping', 'gorgeous', 'song', 'Sea', 'will', 'say', 'self', 'deprecating', 'humor', 'honesty', 'audience', 'was', 'refreshing', 'Too', 'bad', 'did', ""n't"", 'shed', 'toupe', 'bowtie', 'more', 'down', 'earth', 'version', 'show', 'what', 'shame', 'died', 'so', 'soon', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'have', 'around', 'today.This', 'DVD', 'nice', 'special', 'features', 'Bobby', 'various', 'television', 'appearances', 'film', 'trailers', 'comedy', 'sketches', 'So', 'more', 'feast', 'Bobby', 'be', 'remembered', 'are', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'soar', 'worthwhile', 'hear', 'golden', 'chops', 'see', 'smiling', 'face', 'one', 'last', 'time']",N/A

But this DVD is hardly the unalloyed joy some claim. The two stars are for Darin's energy during this performance, undeniable and awesome given his physical fragility.I was first exposed to Darin as a kid, during his Tim Hardin and then self-penned ""protest"" period (1966-69).  He dropped the ""-by"" from his stage first name and the rug from his scalp, and seemed quite a revelation.  The only indication that it wasn't an entirely honest transformation was his insistence on calling the harmonica a ""blues harp,"" a term whose fleeting currency had already passed by then. It smacked of a desperation to seem ""hip"" to a younger audience (remember hipness?!).But, in his last years,he went back to his ersatz-Sinatra, showman shtick. It may do him an injustice, but on the evidence of the ""Mack Is Back"" DVD, at heart Darin was always a Las Vegas ham.  Yes, he could manage many genres of music, but he performed most of them with a glitzy lack of sensibility that reminds you of the Chinese water torture that was Sammy Davis Jnr.'s rendering of ""Mr. Bojangles."" And just like Davis (and others whose showbiz upbringing harked back to the fifties), Darin seemed more consumed with a need to demonstrate his showboating versatility -- look, ma, no hands! -- than with the music itself.On ""Mack Is Back,"" Darin's dance moves are exuberant but mostly toe-curling, as are the dirge-like codas he tacks onto many of the songs. His look is out of the Rat Pack Medallion Man handbook.  He sings even his classic hits in the perfunctory, throwaway style of a performer who has been there too many times before.

Unfortunately pretty much the whole thing is a disappointment.  I don't know how they selected the songs presented here, but they seem to have managed to find some of the worst songs recorded in the 70's; ones that just have the same line sung over and over AND OVER.  There's a lot of useless pandering with the audience which I think was mostly to give him a bit of a rest between songs as it is so obvious in this video that he was not well.

I'll stick to that one and his CD's.",2,Disappointing,1268352000,"03 12, 2010",2010,784,"[""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'fan', 'remember', 'show', '70', 'was', 'quite', 'excited', 'when', 'found', 'video', 'Unfortunately', 'pretty', 'much', 'whole', 'thing', 'disappointment', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'selected', 'songs', 'presented', 'here', 'seem', 'have', 'managed', 'find', 'worst', 'songs', 'recorded', '70', 'ones', 'just', 'have', 'same', 'line', 'sung', 'AND', 'OVER', 'lot', 'useless', 'pandering', 'audience', 'think', 'was', 'mostly', 'give', 'bit', 'rest', 'songs', 'so', 'obvious', 'video', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'still', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'do', 'favor', 'get', 'Bobby', 'Darin', 'Beyond', 'Song', 'instead', 'just', 'clips', 'oh', 'so', 'much', 'better', ""'ll"", 'stick', 'one', 'CD']",N/A

Although I have been a fan of Sinatra and Sammy Davis,Jr. for many years..NONE could surpass his magnifcent artistry.  He just absolutely ran ""circles"" around EVERY great performer who has ever lived.  His untimely death on Decemmber 20, 1973 was an absolute loss to the entertainment industry....""bar none.""  That date will be forever etched in my heart and soul, as well as, in my mind.  Personally...that was the day ""the music died.""  Never, in the future, will there ever be an all-around performer that could EVER come close to this phenomenal TALENT!!!!!!!

Bobby Darin was an incredible performer and in my opinion, the best I have ever seen.  From If I Were A Carpenter to Splish Splash, Bobby Darin tears it up on stage.  It is amazing to watch this knowing that 7 months later, Bobby Darin would die from complications from blood poisoning and a bad heart.  The only disappointing thing about the DVD is that Mac The Knife is at the end and is playing while some of the credits are playing.  Otherwise, it is a great DVD with lots of bonus material.",5,A great performer!
