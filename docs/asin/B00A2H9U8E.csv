Now what we are watching is a film that is fun, fast paced and entertaining.A horror film needs to be a like a roller-coaster ride in many ways. You laugh. You scream. You sit there in your sit dreading the anticipation of horror. And when it is all said and done, you come away from it all having a good time. In that sense, The Collection is a success, in that it meets all those requirements.Now, I will say this, The Collection is one of those films whose script would not stand up to close scrutiny. In some ways, it even feels like a ripoff of Aliens and just about any film in the Saw franchise. The Collection isn't a film that is going to enlighten you or provide you any great depth or meaning.

It kept me entertained & on the edge of my seat the whole time. Not easy for the otherwise washed out movies that come out in this genre. There is no time wasted with developing characters or backgrounds. We dive right in with an amazing nightclub massacre scene. One of the best since that scene from Blade.Josh Stewart makes for a great unsuspecting protagonist - the guy who you wouldn't peg as your first choice to be the hero but comes out on top in the end. I loved the background / musical score. Especially noteworthy is the scene towards the end where you feel you are going to lose our protagonist Arkin (Josh Stewart)to burning flames. Just as you think all is lost, Emma Fitzpatrick's character smashes the showcases filled with water and saves him. The track that plays during this scene (Out of the fire by Charlie Clouser) is especially uplifting and fits the scene so well. I loved it!

Oh, I don't think that makes me a sick or psychotic person at all.  I think it's that horror - a truly good (not great) horror film - taps into some of our deepest fears.  About the dark.  About abduction.  About knives or bullets or other blunt instruments.  About isolation.  About being caged.  About the sight of blood.  About entrapment.  About bugs.  About killers.  About death, even.  Life is so fragile, after all, and we never truly know when it's going to be taken away from us, and some folks who make good horror (again, not great) learned a long time ago that ""if you build it, people will come.""(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Elena (played by the comely Emma Fitzpatrick) didn't realize that she was in for the night of her life by attending what she thought was going to be a killer underground `rave' warehouse party.  Well, `killer' was right as it turns out the venue was little more than an elaborate booby trap meant to ensnare hundreds of victims for `The Collector,' the latest masked psychopath to put teens on the run.  By a strange twist of fate, Elena frees Arkin - the Collector's last intended victim - and just when the man thinks he's finally free, he finds himself abducted once more: this time by a team of crack mercenaries hired by Elena's millionaire father.  Despite the odds being stacked against them, they're intent on finding the young girl before any harm comes of her, but they'll need Arkin to led them back into the territory of his deepest, darkest fears if they're to have a chance.God only knows what's waiting for them ...THE COLLECTION is a sequel to 2009's modest hit THE COLLECTOR, which was the first to feature the said psychopath - a masked man whose apparently fetish is to collect human specimens for display in his own grotesque menagerie.  And, for all its faults, I thought much of THE COLLECTION to actually be well-made if not a bit predictable, delivering exactly the same kind of nerve-wracking suspense audiences long enamored with the SAW franchise have come to expect.  How is that possible?  Well, it's probably because the writers of SAW IV, V, VI, and VII were none other than Patrick Melton and Dunstan - the same team at work here.So - much like has already been done in the SAW yarns - audiences can expect more than the lion's share of elaborate traps and get-ups that promise to produce more blood per ounce than any other franchise worth its weight in human bones.  Yes, it's gratuitous, but it's just what the doctor ordered when it comes to contemporary horror.  For that matter, as much as we protest things used to be different, there really isn't that much difference stylistically in this than say most schlock produced in the 80's; if anything, the writers have grown a bit more involved in fleshing out the craziness (pun intended), and the film works entirely on that level.To her credit, Fitzpatrick rises to the challenge, becoming the newest scream queen to enter that unfortunate sorority of actresses.  She's to be commended for showing up, taking her punches, and rising to the challenge to save the hero when the stakes are down.  Josh Stewart returns as Arkin (from the first film), and he as well embodies the character with enough cynicism to make him real along with enough realism to make audiences root for him.  The rest of the cast?  Meh, it feels a bit obligatory, almost as much so as having the main protagonist wear a leather fetish mask.  Didn't Jason and Leatherface corner the market on those scares?  Is there really room for one more?If anything, THE COLLECTION's downside is that it expects its audience to suspend disbelief perhaps a bit farther than most films of this variety.  I mean just how much disposal income can one psychopath have?  He's outfitted an old hotel with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and steel and traps; where does he get all of his money?  I honestly expected that there would be some grand reveal in the final reel, and I expected he'd pull off his mask to show me none other than Donald Trump waiting underneath.  But, alas, it wasn't meant to be.THE COLLECTION is produced by LD Entertainment and Fortress Features.  DVD distribution is being handled through Lionsgate.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds about as good as anything else in the horror genre these days; there are a few directorial flourishes compliments of Dunstan (who pulls double duty here as writer and director) that could've used some tightening, but film is a form of art.  Lastly, there are a wealth of special features - five short flicks exploring the film and the process; a handful of alternate scenes; the theatrical trailer; as well as Dunstan and Melton's audio commentary - that should keep interested parties glued to their seats if not already impaled on them!RECOMMENDED.  It may not be perfect.  It may not be the most original.  But THE COLLECTION is lean and mean enough at just over 80 minutes that it should keep the interest of horror fans, at least, and that's no easy feat.  Enjoy it for what it's worth - don't look for it to make perfect sense - and you're liable to have as much fun with it as I did.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Lionsgate provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE COLLECTION by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",3,Suspend Your Disbelief And Be Scared Silly Of THE

Now when I hear the term pornographic violence, I know what they're talking about.Here's the scoop. The Collector is back at it big time. He's holding the city hostage with fear. One night Elena (Emma Fitzpatrick) goes to a club. The Collector has set up an elaborate, Rube Goldberg-ish contraption and begins killing the club goers wholesale. Emma ends up locked in one of his trunks. Her rich father has his bodyguard recruit some buds to rescue her. But, to do so, he must hire another convicted killer to show them The Collector's lair. Said killer is the only one to ever have escaped The Collector with his life. He leads them into the lion's den.This is monstrous. It's filled with a lot of quick-cut shock visuals. Bugs, blood, dismembered corpses and all other kind of vile garbage. Of course The Collector's lair is filled with booby-traps and people get killed, maimed or dismembered in any number of clever ways. The rescue team have a sharp, tough, hip look (and of course one of them is female) but they're anything but tough and sharp. They get picked off with little problem. The colors are over saturated and tend toward a sickly pallor. It were as though the produces/director tried to think of every disturbing image possible and through it out there. And, as has been done before, the killer leading the rescue team into darkness is the one guy you end up rooting for. There are some clever turns in the plot and you want Emma outta there so there is some investment into what is happening. But, overall, this is some pretty sick stuff.

I can remember 40 some odd years ago when my father took me to see the Sam Peckinpah classic ""The Wild Bunch"" I had never seen so much blood it seemed to burst off the screen.They probably used more squibs (small explosive packets of stage blood) then any film of it's time. When I read that director Marcus Dunstun (Saw Franchise) saw this film as a tribute to splatter pictures I thought to myself that he had paid proper homage to the movies he loves.We streamed ""The Collection"" on a lark and I have to say were surprisingly entertained by it. Rich production value and great lighting must have eaten much of the budget, well that and untold gallons of stage blood and gore - but nonetheless the atmosphere is bleak, un nerving and immediate.There's an unexpected and at times comical creativity to how the cast is killed off and welcome shots albeit cliche' abound such as double doors swinging open to show our hero or nemeses in silhouette, a weapon of huge, toy like proportion in each hand. It's images like this that had me remembering playing Doom on a 486 computer.The cast is surprisingly solid, a good notch up from the wooden  ""community theater"" levels of acting we usually see associated with these kinds of films. It's also refreshing to see a complete absence of thirty year olds playing victimized high school students.The Collection isn't brain food, you're not going to find yourself discussing sub plots and deeper meanings here.

The former was such a popular direct-to-video rental, that it's sequel actually wound up on the big screen, and how it avoided an NC-17 rating is beyond me. I've seen a ton of Horror movies, it's one of my favorite genres, so I can say, without hesitation that The Collection is one of the creepiest, goriest, and most clever Horror films I have ever seen. This crazed man in a mask is looking to collect certain types of people and if they pass his test, they can join his collection. If they fail, they become experiments in human suffering. In the first film, we see career criminal, Arkin O'Brien, fighting for his life. In the sequel, we see Arkin escape and lead a band of mercenaries back to the Collectors hideout, in order to rescue a captured rich girl. Of course once they get there, they find a maze of terror that rivals any film you've ever seen. I thought some of the machines in the Saw films were clever, but until you see this film, you haven't seen anything yet! How people come up with these things is beyond rational thought. Of all the ways to torture people, to come up with machines and techniques that exceed everything we've seen before is just sick...sick and very cool. The cast is the same as in every Horror movies, a bunch of dumb, no named actors, following a couple of smart people in order to stay alive as long as they can. What's special here is the story, the affects, and the level of depravity. The Collection is one of the most violent and gruesome Horror films to come along in years.

Arkin (Stewart) escapes from The Collector's house and is going to the hospital trying to recover, before he can get there he is once again abducted and is forced to help a wealthy man rescue his daughter from yet another booby trapped house. Can Arkin survive another round of hell? I will admit that I did like the Saw series, but because of the actual story line and not because of the huge amounts of gore, although I will say that did add to the story. The Collector was trying so hard to be Saw but never quite got there. I'm not sure why they made a sequel but I sat down to watch. While this one had much more gore and many more people being cut up it was essentially the same movie as the first one. I realize people that watch these aren't in it for the plot, but there needs to be some difference to warrant a sequel I think. On the other hand this movie is pretty much just made for people who love gore so I could be wrong.
