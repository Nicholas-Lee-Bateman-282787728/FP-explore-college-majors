I have only watched the first hour so far, but that segment shows how close Christianity is in its many flavors. The central theme of Christianity is Jesus! That applies whether your faith is Catholic or Protestant. Either Jesus is who He said He is or else he is a liar or deluded. There is no middle ground here, no way to call him a good man if he isn't God. Jesus said ""I and the Father are one"". No 'good' man would ever make that claim. The first segment centers on the Catholic beliefs concerning Jesus and even if you are a Baptist you will find yourself saying ""Amen!"" all the way through. I know that as the episodes progress I will find areas of difference, but if believing in Jesus is the key to eternal life then Protestant and Catholic alike will be in good shape.Now with respect to the blu-ray presentation, the picture clarity is wonderful! I haven't seen the DVD version so I can't compare the two, but I expect that most buyers will want the very best viewing experience and will opt for the blu-ray version. You won't be disappointed in the visuals, I promise you that. One of the beautiful aspects of Catholicism is their ornate sanctuaries...and blu-ray makes the frescoes, paintings and statuary really jump out at you in eye-popping realism. I recently visited St. Paul, Minnesota and toured the Cathedral of Saint Paul while there. You would be hard pressed to find a Protestant church with such reverence to those who served Christ in the past. There are reminders everywhere of those who were His stalwarts in service; men and women who stood by Him in life and then proclaimed His glory after the crucifixion.When I have completed all the episodes I may decide to add to this post, but not in any derogatory manner since I harbor no ill will toward those who view Christianity in a somewhat different light.",5,Very informative ...,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,1950,"[""'m"", 'not', 'Catholic', 'am', 'not', 'likely', 'become', 'Catholic', 'However', ""n't"", 'take', 'anything', 'away', 'series', 'have', 'only', 'watched', 'first', 'hour', 'so', 'far', 'segment', 'how', 'close', 'Christianity', 'many', 'flavors', 'central', 'theme', 'Christianity', 'Jesus', 'faith', 'Catholic', 'Protestant', 'Jesus', 'who', 'said', 'else', 'liar', 'deluded', 'middle', 'ground', 'here', 'way', 'call', 'good', 'man', ""n't"", 'God', 'Jesus', 'said', 'Father', 'are', 'one', ""'good"", 'man', 'would', 'ever', 'make', 'claim', 'first', 'segment', 'centers', 'Catholic', 'beliefs', 'concerning', 'Jesus', 'even', 'are', 'Baptist', 'will', 'find', 'saying', 'Amen', 'way', 'know', 'episodes', 'progress', 'will', 'find', 'areas', 'difference', 'believing', 'Jesus', 'key', 'eternal', 'life', 'then', 'Protestant', 'Catholic', 'alike', 'will', 'be', 'good', 'shape.Now', 'respect', 'blu-ray', 'presentation', 'picture', 'clarity', 'wonderful', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'version', 'so', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'two', 'expect', 'most', 'buyers', 'will', 'want', 'very', 'best', 'viewing', 'experience', 'will', 'opt', 'blu-ray', 'version', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'visuals', 'promise', 'One', 'beautiful', 'aspects', 'Catholicism', 'ornate', 'sanctuaries', 'blu-ray', 'frescoes', 'paintings', 'statuary', 'really', 'out', 'eye-popping', 'realism', 'recently', 'visited', 'St.', 'Paul', 'Minnesota', 'toured', 'Cathedral', 'Saint', 'Paul', 'there', 'would', 'be', 'hard', 'pressed', 'find', 'Protestant', 'church', 'such', 'reverence', 'who', 'served', 'Christ', 'past', 'are', 'reminders', 'everywhere', 'who', 'were', 'stalwarts', 'service', 'men', 'women', 'who', 'stood', 'Him', 'life', 'then', 'proclaimed', 'glory', 'crucifixion.When', 'have', 'completed', 'episodes', 'may', 'decide', 'add', 'post', 'not', 'derogatory', 'manner', 'harbor', 'ill', 'will', 'who', 'view', 'Christianity', 'somewhat', 'different', 'light']",N/A
