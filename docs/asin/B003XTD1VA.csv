1371081,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B003XTD1VA,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[6, 7]","Father of my Children is one of the more moving and beautiful films I have seen in a long time.It is very difficult to summarize this film without spoiling the important sense of discovery. Gregoire is a very successful film producer. He and his wife Sylvia have two daughters, one a teenager the other much younger. About all that should be said, Gregoire is driven to succeed with his production company and obviously doesn't spend as much time with his family as he should. On the other hand, this is a family that loves each other deeply. Ah, the first level of bitter sweetness in this film.The film is truly a masterpiece in using the film language of folding a story over on itself. At almost exactly the halfway point of this film, the major dramatic event happens. Where the arc of the characters built up to that moment, they descend in the exact same manner to the conclusion. It's comforting to watch a film where the opening shots are replicated at the end of the film; it makes for such good closure.The acting is superb. Gregoire is played by Louis-Do de Lencquesaing, a French actor with a long history of films that didn't necessarily make it to the US (in Cache he was the store owner,Cache (Hidden)). He plays an intense but Bohemian creative person. Although he isn't treating his family the best, he is still an empathetic character. Chiara Caselli, an Italian actress (My Own Private Idaho: The Criterion Collection, andRipley's Game), is stunning as Sylvia. I loved her character the most; she is strong, intelligent, and tender all at once. Alice de Lencquesaing, (Summer Hours: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]) plays the oldest daughter. Her performance is the biggest surprise of the film. She follows beautifully in her mother's footsteps and is very believable with the character change she goes through.This film is not rated. There is a somewhat graphic scene that younger viewers might not understand. I imagine it would have had an R or PG-13 rating, based on that scene alone. A mature thirteen year old could easily watch this film.The directing of this film was excellent. Framing was well used and added to the drama of the film. Technically, this is an excellent film.I really love this film. It is not a happy film. The family demonstrates amazing emotion and power in front of some incredibly difficult odds. This is a rare example of really fine cinema.",5,Gorgeous Bittersweet Film,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,2396,"['Father', 'Children', 'one', 'more', 'moving', 'beautiful', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'long', 'time.It', 'very', 'difficult', 'summarize', 'film', 'spoiling', 'important', 'sense', 'discovery', 'Gregoire', 'very', 'successful', 'film', 'producer', 'wife', 'Sylvia', 'have', 'two', 'daughters', 'one', 'teenager', 'other', 'much', 'younger', 'should', 'be', 'said', 'Gregoire', 'driven', 'succeed', 'production', 'company', 'obviously', ""n't"", 'spend', 'as', 'much', 'time', 'family', 'should', 'other', 'hand', 'family', 'other', 'deeply', 'Ah', 'first', 'level', 'bitter', 'sweetness', 'film.The', 'film', 'truly', 'masterpiece', 'using', 'film', 'language', 'folding', 'story', 'almost', 'exactly', 'halfway', 'point', 'film', 'major', 'dramatic', 'event', 'Where', 'arc', 'characters', 'built', 'up', 'moment', 'descend', 'exact', 'same', 'manner', 'conclusion', 'comforting', 'watch', 'film', 'where', 'opening', 'shots', 'are', 'replicated', 'end', 'film', 'such', 'good', 'closure.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'Gregoire', 'played', 'Louis-Do', 'Lencquesaing', 'French', 'actor', 'long', 'history', 'films', 'did', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'make', 'US', 'Cache', 'was', 'store', 'owner', 'Cache', 'Hidden', 'intense', 'Bohemian', 'creative', 'person', ""n't"", 'treating', 'family', 'best', 'still', 'empathetic', 'character', 'Chiara', 'Caselli', 'Italian', 'actress', 'Own', 'Private', 'Idaho', 'Criterion', 'Collection', 'andRipley', 'Game', 'stunning', 'Sylvia', 'loved', 'character', 'most', 'strong', 'intelligent', 'tender', 'once', 'Alice', 'Lencquesaing', 'Summer', 'Hours', 'Criterion', 'Collection', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'performance', 'biggest', 'surprise', 'film', 'beautifully', 'mother', 'footsteps', 'very', 'believable', 'character', 'change', 'through.This', 'film', 'not', 'rated', 'somewhat', 'graphic', 'scene', 'younger', 'viewers', 'might', 'not', 'understand', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'R', 'PG-13', 'rating', 'based', 'scene', 'alone', 'mature', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'could', 'easily', 'watch', 'film.The', 'directing', 'film', 'was', 'excellent', 'Framing', 'was', 'well', 'used', 'added', 'drama', 'film', 'Technically', 'excellent', 'film.I', 'really', 'love', 'film', 'not', 'happy', 'film', 'family', 'amazing', 'emotion', 'power', 'front', 'incredibly', 'difficult', 'odds', 'rare', 'example', 'really', 'fine', 'cinema']",N/A
1371082,A328S9RN3U5M68,B003XTD1VA,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","Young Writer/Director Mia Hansen-Lve has created a story loosely based on a real situation that manages to examine the central aspect of family love: 'the defeat of death, the victory of life'. Gr&eacute;goire Canvel (Louis-Do de Lencquesaing) is a producer in the film industry, an auteur who is devoted to quality films. As a producer he has several films in varying stages of production (including one in Sweden directed by a difficult genius who has little respect for cost containment) and the financial aspects of his Moon Films is in rocky terrain, despite being surrounded by a staff devoted to his vision and going without pay because of their commitment. At the same time Gr&eacute;goire is a devoted husband to his wise wife Sylvia (Chiara Caselli) and to his three daughters - the oldest being the sensitive Cl&eacute;mence (a stunning portrayal by young Alice de Lencquesaing), Valentine (Alice Gautier) and Billie (Manelle Driss) - taking country walks with them and being wholly involved with their family activities, despite the fact that he is constantly on the cellphone managing the tragedies that abound at work. It is apparent that everyone who comes into contact with Gr&eacute;goire feels the special gifts he has - except for the lawyer and creditors he tries to avoid. The financial sinkhole opens and Gr&eacute;goire, in despair, commits suicide. The story actually begins here, as the point of the film is how each of the people who came under Gr&eacute;goire's influence - co-workers, wife and children, and friends - responds to the loss of this man. There is not the usual breast-beating grieving, but rather a quiet study of how each of these people is affected by and reacts to the passing of a solitary genius by suicide. The film is definitely one that is life affirming rather than an extended eulogy!The entire cast is excellent, with special kudos to the children as well as to Eric Elmosnino who plays a rock bound friend to the family and the director's brother Igor Hansen-Lve whose small part as a hopeful writer is richly detailed. This may be too early a time to judge the talent of Mia Hansen-Lve, but if she is able to maintain the quality she achieves in THE FATHER OF MY CHILDREN, she has an exciting future in cinema. Highly recommended.

1371083,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B003XTD1VA,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[10, 10]","The French import ""Father of My Children,"" which won a Special Jury prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, has a quiet intensity that sneaks up on you.  This drama about a man in despair and a family in tumult is also an insightful look at the modern film industry.  The film, halved into two distinct parts, relies on a cataclysmic tragedy midway through to change narrative directions.  And to writer/director Mia Hansen-Love's credit, the film succeeds in this difficult and unexpected transition.  I suspect that a number of other reviews will be inclined to mention the nature of this big moment.  I, for one, think it would be a mistake to share this piece of the cinematic puzzle--and I will refrain from giving away any specifics.  Let's just say, I went into ""Father of My Children"" without any pre-existing knowledge and I think the picture benefits by unraveling on its own terms.The film presents us with Gregoire, a French film producer who is struggling to finance the various projects his company is juggling.  Assured and well liked, Gregoire is the consummate professional dedicated to the artistry of film.  As the business situation becomes more dire, his relationship with his family becomes increasingly distant as work starts to intrude on quality time.  On this occasion, however, Gregoire may not be able to extricate himself from the financial burdens that threaten the company.  When the aforementioned tragedy takes place, everyone is shocked and left to pick up the pieces.  The family must rely on one another in unexpected ways and take up new responsibilities at home and with the film company.  It's an emotionally difficult period that helps to redefine the roles and relationships within the clan.At heart, ""Father of My Children"" (as you might guess from its title) is a family based drama.  One of the joys was to see how close and loving they are to one another.  And while there is some understandable alienation and bitterness, never do we lose the sense of real family unity.  Heartbreaking and hopeful, by turns, this is an extremely believable film made more so by a naturalistic and likable cast.  Even the children give perfectly pitched performances.  The film has a genuine pathos that grounds and connects the viewers.  I was with these characters through thick and thin.  A quietly moving and powerful experience--I was sold on the film's emotional center.  The additional cinematic details in the depiction of the filmmaking process was a big extra bonus as well.

But money gets tighter than ever at Moon Films. Half-way into the movie, without wanting to give too much away from the plot, a tragic event occurs.You'll need to see for yourself how it all plays out, but I promise you that you won't be disappointed. The overall feel of the movie is a huge credit to writer-director Mia Hansen-Lve.
