1339130,A1S6U42368WJQE,B003EYEEI8,"Steven Daedalus ""Steve""","[23, 23]","The Korean War, which some at the time insisted on calling a ""police action"" despite the 50,000 or so American deaths, was never really ""forgotten.""  It just naturally went down the memory hole, largely for two reasons:  (1)  The peace talks in Panmunjom dragged on for two years and the public lost interest; and (2)  the North Koreans, Chinese, and Russians lost in their attempt to expand their ideology but we didn't win either.  The war ended in a cease fire, not a truce, just about where it began.  We still have troops stationed at the 38th parallel and so do the North Koreans, and every once in a while there is a minor incident of violence.This set of four disks takes us from ""Prologue -- The Road to War"" to interviews with two Medal of Honor recipients.  Most of the first three disks deal with the military situation, the remainder with interviews.  There are multiple talking heads, ranging from historians to PFCs.  All the heads are American.I found it an enlightening set.  It's balanced in its assessment of the enemy and the UN forces, although the Brits, Australians, Greeks, and Belgians are hardly mentioned.  The South Koreans, the soldiers of the Republic of Korea, get their just due.  (The ROK soldiers were regarded as fierce warriors during the Vietnam conflict.)  So does the Navy, especially in providing close air cover.  The US Air Force was found to be less useful.  Their jets were too limited in range and loitering time, too fast, flew too high, and there were difficulties in communication, whereas the Navy and Marine Corps pilots had thorough training in ground support.  The Air Force is criticized for dropping on American troops.  Curiously, the most effective ground support came from the legendary F4U Corsairs and the Douglas Skyraiders -- both relatively slow, propellor-driven aircraft that could be loaded with ordinance but were no match for newer Soviet airplanes.  The Corsair had had a top speed of more than 400 miles per hour by the end of World War II, but carrying bombs and rockets the aging fighters were slowed to about 270 miles per hour in Korea.  The Air Force was kept busy with MIG-15s in the northern part of the peninsula.One of the more interesting points made in this series is that the war began unintentionally.  The 38th parallel split the peninsula into two parts as a matter of convenience and geography.  In the north, the allies of the Chinese and Russians under Kim Jong Il accepted the Japanese surrender.  In the south, the Japanese surrendered to Syngman Rhee.  Both Kim and Rhee formed independent and antagonistic dictatorships and were anxious to establish hegemony over the entire peninsula.  President Truman refused to arm the South with heavy weapons, knowing that Rhee would invade the North, but Stalin made the mistake of arming the North, which promptly invaded the South.  The Soviets were boycotting the UN at the time the decision was made to send troops to defend the South, otherwise they certainly would have vetoed it.The first American troops under MacArthur were sent directly from desk jobs in Japan to fight a highly motivated and better equipped army.  The intention was to make a symbolic effort that would cow the North Koreans and send them back.  But the Americans were unprepared and this early effort, known as Task Force Smith, suffered heavily and were pushed back.  They had never seen Russian T-34s before, the best medium tank of World War II, and were surprised to find their bazooka rounds bounced harmlessly off the hulls.Well, I suppose this isn't the place to outline the entire Korean War.  Political considerations balance the interviews with veterans, and a few historians add the perspective that only time can provide.  MacArthur's dismissal gets a section for itself.  The consensus of historians is that he was in over his head, an old man who could still pull off some amazing feats but was given to extremist solutions.  MacArthur assured Truman there would be no Chinese intervention, and when there was, he wanted to ""unleash"" Chiang Kai Shek on the mainland (where Chiang had recently lost the war) and to use nuclear bombs in China to establish a buffer zone, which almost certainly would have precipitated another World War.  His public pronouncements continued, even after several warnings from the president, until finally he was relieved of command and returned home to a hero's welcome.It's a good overview of the Korean conflict -- not too much detail, but even-handed in its presentation.  Some of the veterans are more articulate than others, and it might have been profitable to spend more time on the military actions and less on unfocused interviews.  POWs describe Chinese methods of interrogation but no one mentions their adoption by the West.  (Egs., (1) the prisoner sits while the interrogator stands and looms over him; (2) bad cop/good cop.)  I missed, too, a more thorough description of the kinds of weapons involved.  But that's minor.By way of editorial comment -- though this isn't in the film --  and whatever the political ups and downs of South Korea, the North got by far the worst of it.  You ought to see a recent night-time satellite picture of the Korean peninsula.  (You can probably Google one.)  The South is all lighted up, cities, villages, highways, all aglow.  Until you reach the 38th parallel.  Above that all is black except for a few dim cities.",4,Refresher Course.,1358035200,"01 13, 2013",2013,5421,"['Korean', 'War', 'time', 'insisted', 'calling', 'police', 'action', '50,000', 'so',
