One reason I wanted to have this DVD was so that I would have a record of what happened on that tragic day. The other reason was so that I would have something to pass on to my son, so he could show his future children. I highly recommend this DVD.

We lost some of our innocence, realized our vulnerabilities, and came together in our time of greatest need to make a stand.  The tragic loss of life will always be heartbreaking and it will never be forgotten.Among the several documentaries that I have seen on the events of September 11th, I'd have to say that CNN has produced the most worthwhile program to date.  Both comprehensive and poignant in its content, the timeline of the attack and events of subsequent months are well detailed and accurate.Beginning with the attack on and the collapse of the World Trade Center Towers, CNN correspondents report right from the streets of New York amidst the chaos of the attack capturing powerful eyewitness accounts and remarkable footage of the heroic acts of many involved.  Moving on from there, the crash occurring at the Pentagon and the downed airliner in Pennsylvania are then analyzed.In the aftermath of the attacks themselves, CNN examines further events that had pivotal roles resulting from terrorism in America.  Operation Enduring Freedom, formation of the Office of Homeland Security, and the Anthrax attacks being the most noteworthy of all.In memorializing the worst terrorist attack to ever happen on American soil, CNN has done a very credible and worthwhile job in bringing it to the public.  Quite moving and even inspirational at times, this is a lasting testament that helps signify the strength and resilience of the Unites States in one of its darkest hours.",5,A time for reflection......,1062374400,"09 1, 2003",2003,1588,"['September', '11th', '2001', 'was', 'turning', 'point', 'United', 'States', 'day', 'changed', 'America', 'forever', 'lost', 'innocence', 'realized', 'vulnerabilities', 'came', 'together', 'time', 'greatest', 'need', 'make', 'stand', 'tragic', 'loss', 'life', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'forgotten.Among', 'several', 'documentaries', 'have', 'seen', 'events', 'September', '11th', ""'d"", 'have', 'say', 'CNN', 'produced', 'most', 'worthwhile', 'program', 'date', 'comprehensive', 'poignant', 'content', 'timeline', 'attack', 'events', 'subsequent', 'months', 'are', 'well', 'detailed', 'accurate.Beginning', 'attack', 'collapse', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'Towers', 'CNN', 'correspondents', 'report', 'right', 'streets', 'New', 'York', 'amidst', 'chaos', 'attack', 'capturing', 'powerful', 'eyewitness', 'accounts', 'remarkable', 'footage', 'heroic', 'acts', 'many', 'involved', 'Moving', 'crash', 'occurring', 'Pentagon', 'downed', 'airliner', 'Pennsylvania', 'are', 'then', 'aftermath', 'attacks', 'CNN', 'further', 'events', 'had', 'pivotal', 'roles', 'resulting', 'terrorism', 'America', 'Operation', 'Enduring', 'Freedom', 'formation', 'Office', 'Homeland', 'Security', 'Anthrax', 'attacks', 'being', 'most', 'noteworthy', 'all.In', 'memorializing', 'worst', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'ever', 'happen', 'American', 'soil', 'CNN', 'done', 'very', 'credible', 'worthwhile', 'job', 'bringing', 'public', 'Quite', 'moving', 'even', 'inspirational', 'times', 'lasting', 'testament', 'signify', 'strength', 'resilience', 'Unites', 'States', 'one', 'darkest', 'hours']",N/A

But life went on, and I nearly forgot the images that had haunted me for many months.  Then I saw this DVD on a store shelf a few days ago as I was shopping and for strange reason, I grabbed it immediately.  I remember that when I came home, I put the DVD disc in without thinking much about what I was about to see. But as I watching the DVD, I became, once again, at a loss of words.  I felt as if I was living the same day once again.  My stomach was turning, and my heart just ached in pain.  My lips were tightly shut as I listened and watched CNN reporters hustling to get information as the attack unfolded.  The footages were all there.  The thundering sound of the jetliner passing overhead, and the screaming pedestrians are all in this DVD.  The video clips of people just like you and me jumping from the towers are stored forever in this DVD.  I haven't seen other DVDs about 9/11, so I cannot say anything about those DVDs.  But to me, with this DVD, knowing that some of my money spent on this DVD will be going to the victims of this tagedy, is good to know.  I don't know anybody in NY or Washington or in Aghganistan.  But as a human being, I am feeling deep remorse about the fights we are making and the killings we are doing unto ourselves.  Afterall, the world is like a big apartment, and we are only tenants on this planet.  ...Well, those are some thoughts that I dwelled on after watching this DVD.  This DVD not only has the footages of the 9/11, but it also shows the events in the following months after the attack including the anthrax scare and the war in Aghganistan.  The spoken words and recounts are poignant, and the reporters' words are from their deep inside.  I felt as if that event a year ago is happening again at this very moment.
