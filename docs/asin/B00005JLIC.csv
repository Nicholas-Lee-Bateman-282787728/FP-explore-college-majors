601298,A1AD9GUL4O81UO,B00005JLIC,AlexsDad,"[1, 2]","I watched ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" from its first original broadcast to its last. I loved Mary & Rhoda as well as the rest of the cast, even Ted. The actors were all top notch. Watching the first season now, the writer's and the production team were still finding their way. That's typical of most shows in their first year and sometimes into the second year. Most well-written shows usually hit their stride in their third year. I think that the uneveness comes with the too cutesy dialogus in some instances. The standout episode for me was ""Support your local mother,"" which introduced the world to Nancy Walker as Ida Morgenstern, Rhoda's (s)mother. If someone has never seen the show, this DVD set might be worth it.

601312,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B00005JLIC,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[6, 7]","This is a review I should have written long ago.  Not only is The Mary Tyler Moore Show one of the very best - and probably the most beloved - situation comedy of all-time, this Season One collection is one of the best television DVD box sets on the market.  The fact that Fox really did Season One right made it all the more unfortunate that plans for Season Two were shelved for so long - now, though, I can write this review with all the delight I can muster, knowing that the long-awaited Season Two set is finally set for release.  It will have a hard time topping this one, but the important thing is that it and the remaining five seasons of the show are released because, as an online petition made clear, we want our Mary.I really don't know how anybody cannot love this show.  Mary, Lou, Murray, Ted, Rhoda, Phyllis - these are characters we all know and love (OK - I'll admit Phyllis is hard to love).  This show was just one classic moment after another, right from the start of the very first episode.  Each half hour was a guaranteed good time with good friends.  I was late for the premiere, not coming into the world until the night of the third episode, so I can't really speak from experience about how different and ground-breaking a show this was back in 1970; as a matter of fact, I didn't really like the show when I was very young - proving just how dumb little kids can be.  Looking back now, though, it's impossible not to view this show as a real product of the 1970s.  Here, in Mary Richards, was a new kind of female character - a single, independent thirty-year-old woman making it on her own in what had traditionally been a man's world.  At its heart, the show was all about the life of a young professional, single woman in a new, feminist era - yet the show was not overtly feminist.  Heck, Mary Richards was exactly the kind of woman any man in his right mind would want to marry.  I also have to note the fact that Mary was the only woman I know of who always looked good in the fashion debacle that was the 1970s.  Then there was Rhoda, an altogether different kind of new woman.  Lou Grant, of course, is a product of traditional thinking, but even he proves flexible - in his own grouchy way - of adjusting to change.  I could go on and on about these characters: good old Murray, Ted Baxter, even Gordy the weatherman.  Ted Knight was nothing short of brilliant in his portrayal of the one-and-only Ted Baxter.In many ways, the show's first season was my favorite.  The original cast gelled instantly, Mary was at her perkiest, and the opening montage and music were perfect - the show's opening changed a little bit from one season to the next.  Sonny Curtis' Love Is All Around was the perfect theme song, and the hat toss at the end became an instant cultural icon.  Not only do you get all 24 shows from that magical first season in this DVD box set, you get all kinds of great extras: commentary on select episodes, an MTM trivia challenge (a piece of cake for us true fans), a still gallery of images related to the show's first season, clips from the Emmy Awards of 1971 (where Ed Asner and Valerie Harper took home awards for best supporting actor and actress in a comedy series, James L. Brooks and Allan Burns won for outstanding writing achievement in a comedy - for an episode CBS adamantly opposed making, and Jay Sandrich won for outstanding directorial achievement in a comedy) - not bad for a show that the clueless suits at CBS absolutely hated in the beginning.  That leads me to the spectacular 90-minute documentary from 2002 that is included in this collection.  It is an incredibly informative, entertaining look back at the show by almost everyone involved in its creation (only one of the writers, Lorenzo Music, and of course the great Ted Knight were no longer with us at that time).  It's really a remarkable story, one that really reinforces the wonderful affinity everyone on this series enjoyed with one another.  It's almost impossible to believe some of the problems the show faced in pre-production, especially the disastrous first live run on what became known as Black Tuesday - and who could have guessed that Gavin MacLeod initially read for the part of Lou Grant, or that CBS did all it could to get Ed Asner replaced?Basically, what I am trying to say is that this Season One set was and is a dream come true for all of us MTM fans.  If you care anything at all about quality television at its best, you will add The Mary Tyler Moore Show Season One to your personal collection.",5,A DVD package worthy of TV's most beloved

601314,A1FDW1SPYKB354,B00005JLIC,David Von Pein,"[15, 16]","On March 22, 2005, Fox Home Entertainment released this ""TV Starter Set"" DVD consisting of four of the best episodes from Season #1 of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"". This one-disc ""Starter"" Pack is nice for those people who are not at all familiar with the MTM Show (and would just like to see a ""sample"" from the series), or for those who are already fans of Mary's show, but don't want to dig too deep into their pocketbooks and purchase the full-season, 24-episode DVD boxed set of the first MTM season, which is a compilation which also earns a perfect ""Five-Star"" rating from this writer.Unlike the deluxe 4-Disc ""Complete First Season"" DVD set of ""TMTMS"", there aren't any special bonus features on this ""Starter"" disc -- just the four episodes (listed below). But it's still a very good deal, IMO, at the bargain price offered.The video quality for these four stellar MTM episodes is simply SUPERB! I doubt these shows could look any better. The colors are perfect and vibrant and there's no annoying video ""noise"" or artifacts (that I can detect at any rate).Each episode here gets its own ""Chapter"" sub-menu on the disc, with 10 chapter stops per show! Video is presented in the original TV ratio of 1.33:1; the audio sounds just fine via the disc's English Dolby Digital soundtrack (of the 2.0 Mono variety). There are even two foreign-language tracks included (in Spanish 2.0 Mono and French 2.0 Mono); plus Subtitles in English and Spanish. Unfortunately, there is not a ""Play All"" feature included.There's also a very short ""Mary Tyler Moore TV Spot"" included on this disc. This is not an original 1970 CBS-TV promo for TMTMS, however. It's a brief 15-second ad pitching the 4-Disc ""Complete First Season"" set of The MTM Show.A 12-page insert (DVD advertising booklet) also comes with this Starter Set, featuring many ads for other FOX TV-On-DVD products.Here's a glance at the four episodes that make up this ""MTM Starter Set"" (with original CBS-TV Air Dates in parenthesis)............1.) ""Love Is All Around"" (09/19/1970)2.) ""Support Your Local Mother"" (10/24/1970)3.) ""Toulouse-Lautrec Is One Of My Favorite Artists"" (10/31/1970)4.) ""The Snow Must Go On"" (11/7/1970)""Love Is All Around"" is the debut episode of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", and does a great job of introducing the viewing audience to ""Mary Richards"", ""Rhoda Morgenstern"", ""Phyllis Lyndstrom"", ""Lou Grant"", ""Murray Slaughter"", and ""Ted Baxter"".Everybody in this series was first-rate all the way, with the show picking up more steam as the first season progressed; and it got even better in Season #2.""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was one of the most popular and successful TV comedy series ever aired on network television, accumulating an amazing 67 Emmy nominations during its seven-year period on the airwaves (1970 to 1977). The series won 29 total Emmy Awards, including four during its rookie season.This MTM ""Starter"" disc is a fine supplementary addition to the DVD collection of anyone who loves flat-out good TV shows.",5,"For ""Starters"", Check Out These Four Terrific MTM Episodes!",1111449600,"03 22, 2005",2005,3007,"['March', '22', '2005', 'Fox', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'released', 'TV', 'Starter', 'Set', 'DVD', 'consisting', 'four', 'best', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'one-disc', 'Starter', 'Pack', 'nice', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'not', 'familiar', 'MTM', 'Show', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'see', 'sample', 'series', 'who', 'are', 'already', 'fans', 'Mary', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'dig', 'too', 'deep', 'pocketbooks', 'purchase', 'full-season', '24-episode', 'DVD', 'boxed', 'set', 'first', 'MTM', 'season', 'compilation', 'also', 'perfect', 'Five-Star', 'rating', 'deluxe', '4-Disc', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'DVD', 'set', 'TMTMS', 'are', ""n't"", 'special', 'bonus', 'features', 'Starter', 'disc', 'just', 'four', 'episodes', 'listed', 'still', 'very', 'good', 'deal', 'IMO', 'bargain', 'price', 'offered.The', 'video', 'quality', 'four', 'stellar', 'MTM', 'episodes', 'simply', 'SUPERB', 'doubt', 'shows', 'could', 'look', 'better', 'colors', 'are', 'perfect', 'vibrant', 'annoying', 'video', 'noise', 'artifacts', 'can', 'detect', 'rate', '.Each', 'episode', 'here', 'own', 'Chapter', 'sub-menu', 'disc', '10', 'chapter', 'stops', 'show', 'Video', 'presented', 'original', 'TV', 'ratio', '1.33:1', 'audio', 'just', 'fine', 'disc', 'English', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'soundtrack', '2.0', 'Mono', 'variety', 'are', 'even', 'two', 'foreign-language', 'tracks', 'included', 'Spanish', '2.0', 'Mono', 'French', '2.0', 'Mono', 'Subtitles', 'English', 'Spanish', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'Play', 'All', 'feature', 'also', 'very', 'short', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'TV', 'Spot', 'included', 'disc', 'not', 'original', '1970', 'CBS-TV', 'promo', 'TMTMS', 'however', 'brief', '15-second', 'ad', 'pitching', '4-Disc', 'Complete', 'First', 'Season', 'set', 'MTM', 'Show.A', '12-page', 'insert', 'DVD', 'advertising', 'booklet', 'also', 'Starter', 'Set', 'featuring', 'many', 'ads', 'other', 'FOX', 'TV-On-DVD', 'products.Here', 'glance', 'four', 'episodes', 'make', 'up', 'MTM', 'Starter', 'Set', 'original', 'CBS-TV', 'Air', 'Dates', 'parenthesis', '1', 'Love', '09/19/1970', '2', 'Support', 'Your', 'Local', 'Mother', '10/24/1970', '3', 'Toulouse-Lautrec', 'Is', 'One', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Artists', '10/31/1970', '4', 'Snow', 'Must', 'Go', '11/7/1970', 'Love', 'debut', 'episode', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'great', 'job', 'introducing', 'viewing', 'audience', 'Mary', 'Richards', 'Rhoda', 'Morgenstern', 'Phyllis', 'Lyndstrom', 'Lou', 'Grant', 'Murray', 'Slaughter', 'Ted', 'Baxter', '.Everybody', 'series', 'was', 'first-rate', 'way', 'show', 'picking', 'up', 'more', 'steam', 'first', 'season', 'progressed', 'got', 'even', 'better', 'Season', '2', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'was', 'one', 'most', 'popular', 'successful', 'TV', 'comedy', 'series', 'ever', 'aired', 'network', 'television', 'accumulating', 'amazing', '67', 'Emmy', 'nominations', 'seven-year', 'period', 'airwaves', '1970', '1977', 'series', 'won', '29', 'total', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'including', 'four', 'rookie', 'season.This', 'MTM', 'Starter', 'disc', 'fine', 'supplementary', 'addition', 'DVD', 'collection', 'anyone', 'who', 'flat-out', 'good', 'TV', 'shows']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season

Mary Tyler Moore was absolutely charming and hysterical in her role as Mary Richards. This DVD set of the first season is a fabulous treat for fans of show.

""Love Is All Around""- Thirty year old Mary Richards moves to Minneapolis and gets a job at WJM-TV, a small local station.2. ""Today I Am a Ma'am""- Mary and Rhoda commiserate about being single.

""The Snow Must Go On""- Minneapolis is hit with a terrible snowstorm on the night that WJM is scheduled to provide election night coverage. The staff, with Rhoda volunteering on the toteboard, can't report the returns, so they have to fill airtime any way they can.9. ""Bob and Rhoda and Teddy and Mary""- It's the evening of the Teddy Awards and Mary is nominated for her first Teddy, but she's more concerned about Bob, an attractive guy who has eyes for her and who also happens to be Rhoda's date.10.

601325,A2SU0F8DZS0OD7,B00005JLIC,Fairleigh Brooks,"[12, 13]","""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" (MTM) is one of the most complete shows to emerge from American television. In the tradition of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""The Dick van Dyke Show,"" it was a comedy with the comedic aspects drawn not simply from real life, but ordinary life.By most complete I mean shows that reflect insightfully the lives most of us end up living, regardless of what, at seventeen, we think our lives are sure to be. And so, pretty much by definition, that point of view eliminates the one-hour dramas that have ranged from ""Hill Street Blues"" to ""L. A. Law,"" from ""The West Wing"" and ""E.R."" to the ""CSI"" franchise. Eliminates them for the simple reason that real, ordinary life includes comedy. Real, ordinary life - if it has meaning at all - includes moments of honest, bonding laughter and not just ironic smirks from hardened cops, bloodied doctors or saavy politicos.And by most complete I mean comedy that is found not by smashing apples into oranges (""My Favorite Martian,"" ""My Mother the Car,"" ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" ""Mork and Mindy,"" ""Third Rock From the Sun""), but by shifting the parallax of daily life just the slightest, at just the right point, to deliver the comedy, if not the absurdity, of human life on planet Earth.""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" followed the classic template of all the preceding great sitcoms. In this template about a half dozen main characters form a genuine community. The adults in the community are of an age at which the dreams of their youth are gone (or are as completed as they're going to be), and have come to realize, accept and perhaps cherish the notion that with whom you work is just as important, if not more so, than what you do.""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""The Dick van Dyke Show"" all accomplished this form within the context of the respective times for each show. (Please note that the family shows, ""Father Knows Best,"" ""The Donna Reed Show,"" ""Leave it to Beaver"" etc., are of a different form and so are part of a different discussion. Those shows focused on the home, and so again by definition cannot fully illustrate a complete life. The shows under discussion focused mainly on work in the larger world, and then on home life.)The times that held the premier of MTM were very much different from the times of those earlier shows. Nineteen seventy, when MTM premiered, was far more different from 1960, when ""The Andy Griffith Show"" premiered, than was 1960 to 1951 when ""I Love Lucy"" premiered. The entire American landscape had changed in the decade between Andy and MTM. Rather than depict an eternally rosy life, the premise of MTM was downbeat - a life that had not worked out, a deliberate physical and emotional ripping away of that old life, a move to a new place with new people. (True, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" was premised on a dead wife and mother, but that fact was establsihed as well in the past with episode one. With episode one of MTM Mary's state of being is current, and will underlie the basic story line for the entire run of the show.)Another MTM key was a lack of hyperbole; that is, ultra-exagerrated characters who would never exist in real life. Like Barney Fife, Ted Baxter is an exaggeration, but not to the point of Cosmo Kramer, or Harry from ""Third Rock ...."" This lack of cartoon-like characterization keeps open the window into the lives of people who worry about what we all do - money, health, being alone, fulfillment. Not that characters on other shows of any description don't have such worries. It's just that on the dramas they do it loudly and explicitly and on the slappy comedies they do it for a laugh and nothing more.On MTM we see characters grapple with these weights as we all do - or would like to, anyway. At first alone, and then quuietly as we ask a friend to bear witness. Just as important, these troubles emerge, unstoppable, from the background. A remarkably poignant scene in MTM finds Mary and her father in her apartment. He is visiting from their hometown, the place that drove Mary to Minneapolis. Standing in the small apartment with the foldout couch he is in the midst of what his daughter's life now is. The last thing he wants to say is ""I told you so."" I don't think that is in his mind at all. He probably wants to say ""I'm sorry. I so wish everything might have worked out better for you."" But he doesn't. And Mary doesn't. There is nothing to say. Finally he asks, in an earnest tone unique to a father talking with his grown daughter, ""Are you happy?"" After a pause timed so perfectly, Mary answers honestly, if with the slightest reticence, ""Yes."" And we know she is. In the arithmetic of the ups and downs, of the good and bad, she is ... and in a way too many of us ache to be.Because the comedy of MTM was just a hair's distance from the drama, it was comedy of the highest order. The funniest moments in life are not set up. (If a priest, a minister and a rabbi ever did walk into a bar together it wasn't funny.) We rarely see these moments coming as they simply flip a situation around, or upside down or inside out.Lou: MARY, YOU'VE GOT SPUNK!MARY: (ALMOST BLUSHING) WELL, THANK YOU, MR. GRANT.LOU: I HATE SPUNK.One night when Mary has agreed to watch twelve-year-old Bess, then learns she must also go out, she hires a baby sitter. Just because the baby sitter is eleven doesn't stop her from saying to Bess, ""Hello, little girl, what's your name?"" Even the classic episode about the funeral of Chuckles the Clown was not an affected device - what else would eulogies for a clown be? And of course this edge of comedy - and the exhileration comedy denotes - was seen at the beginning of every episode. Who hasn't wondered who that scarf-wearing older woman is who is stunned, and possibly offended, by Mary Tyler Moore/Mary Richards as Mary/Mary twirls around downtown Minneapolis and tosses her hat in the sky?The life of Mary Richrads was not just an American life, or a human life. It was a universal life, and by that I mean literally one sentient life - one single experience for better or worse - in the universe. Because it is the oldest of cliches, the one I'm about to use is the moldiest and smarmiest, and that doesn't matter. Cliches become cliches because they are true, and, yes, our lives are nothing without the lives of others. By deliberate calculation and hard work and just dumb luck (in the arts it's always all that together) James Brooks and Mary Tyler Moore created, in the life of mary Richards, one of the most memorable expressions of that cliche.",5,Part of the best of American television,1189641600,"09 13, 2007",2007,6551,"['Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'MTM', 'one', 'most', 'complete', 'shows',

Even though they have been shown edited for many years, several have been released complete on video, like the above episode, so we know what is missing.

Premiering in 1970, I do remember some of the original airings as a 3 year old child. Of course, not many 3 year olds can understand or appreciate the comedic qualities of this show! Now, as an adult, I am thrilled to own the first season, and hope the second season follows soon!Moore stars as Mary Richards, a young woman who relocates to Minneapolis following a broken engagement. Richards moves into a one-room apartment in a building with some interesting neighbors, feisty Rhoda Morganstern, played by Valerie Harper, and daffy Phyllis Lindstrom, played by the very sexy Cloris Leachman.Richards gains employment as an associate news producer at WJM-TV, working for the grouchy but likable Lou Grant, played by Ed Asner, who is simply perfect in his role.The comedy pool draws from the everyday work experiences of the characters, and the hopeless love lives of the single female characters. Oh, yes, let's not forget Mary's dull house parties!Some of the episodes have commentary from production personnel in a separate audio track. As one of the producers points out, Moore is such a talented and generous actress that she does not attempt to corner all the laughs and attention. Indeed, the MTM show bred three spinoffs of moderate success: ""Rhoda,"" ""Phyllis,"" and ""Lou Grant."" Moore's ability and willingness to allow the other actors to strongly develop their roles certainly contributed to this.Gavin MacLeod, who played newswriter Murray Slaughter, went on to a successful role on ""The Love Boat."" Ted Knight, who played the inept anchorman, Ted Baxter, is fabulous, despite having had a limited acting career, mostly as a TV character actor.Most of the minor actors on the show turn out a quality performance. John Amos appears fairly regularly as Gordy Howard, WJM's meteorologist.All in all, this is 100% a top quality, funny, entertaining program.

Cradling the box was like holding the holy grail of television in my own hands. No more watching ""Mary Tyler Moore"" on fuzzy reruns on obscure UHF stations or watching edited versions on Nick-At-Nite. It's all mine - the whole first season.When you watch the episodes, you'll find it hard to believe that in 1970 most television sets were still black and white, and stereo television was unheard of. Although the sound is mono, it comes across sharp and clear. The theme song never sounded better. The most striking aspect is the visual appearance of the show - bright and rich colors in the wardrobes and the sets. And best of all, no abrupt cuts or edits - these are the full-length episodes as originally aired!In one swoop, this DVD box set outdoes anything that was ever attempted for the VHS format. Many of you might recall the frustration of knowing that only two episodes per season were available on the MTM VHS box set. This DVD collection alone is twice as large - and there are six more sets to come! (By the way, for those of you who haven't yet bought the collection, an insert in the box says that the second season is coming out in March.)Now for a few minor criticisms.  Mind you, these criticisms are only the result of the high standards which this box set has in the first place.  First, only three of the twenty-four episodes have commentary. Commentators like Allan Burns, Jim Brooks, David Davis, Jay Sandrich, and Ed Asner (""Mr. Asner"", as he is repeatedly called) bring out new and fascinating details and background tidbits, such as how the MTM cat was filmed, or how much they respected the acting talents of Nancy Walker and Cloris Leachman. Yet the commentary on these three episodes makes watching the other twenty-one more difficult, because you find yourself wondering what they would have said about the uproarious performance of Shelley Berman in ""Divorce Isn't Everything"", along with many other excellent scripts and guest stars over the course of the season.Second, although the ""making of"" documentary is well-done and fascinating, it left out some key material. Much was said about the infamous original scene filmed between Mary Tyler Moore and Ed Asner that flopped, but only stills were shown from the scene. I would have rather seen that scene in full as a bonus than some of the six nearly identical CBS promos (entertaining though they were).Overall, this is a five-star product for a five-star show. If you appreciate classic television, or want to watch the one show that can really bring you back to the 1970s, this is where to look!",5,She finally made it to DVD after all!,1032912000,"09 25, 2002",2002,2759,"['got', 'DVD', 'set', 'as', 'soon', 'was', 'shelves', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'entire', 'set', 'yet', 'have', 'seen', 'enough', 'say', 'truly', 'overwhelming', 'experience', 'Cradling', 'box', 'was', 'holding', 'holy', 'grail', 'television', 'own', 'hands', 'more', 'watching', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'fuzzy', 'reruns', 'obscure', 'UHF', 'stations', 'watching', 'edited', 'versions', 'Nick-At-Nite', 'mine', 'whole', 'first', 'season.When', 'watch', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'find', 'hard', 'believe', '1970', 'most', 'television', 'sets', 'were', 'still', 'black', 'white', 'stereo', 'television', 'was', 'unheard', 'sound', 'mono', 'sharp', 'clear', 'theme', 'song', 'never', 'sounded', 'better', 'most', 'striking', 'aspect', 'visual', 'appearance', 'show', 'bright', 'rich', 'colors', 'wardrobes', 'sets', 'best', 'abrupt', 'cuts', 'edits', 'are', 'full-length', 'episodes', 'originally', 'aired', 'one', 'swoop', 'DVD', 'box', 'set', 'outdoes', 'anything', 'was', 'ever', 'attempted', 'VHS', 'format', 'Many', 'might', 'recall', 'frustration', 'knowing', 'only', 'two', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'available', 'MTM', 'VHS', 'box', 'set', 'DVD', 'collection', 'alone', 'twice', 'as', 'large', 'are', 'six', 'more', 'sets', 'come', 'way', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'bought', 'collection', 'insert', 'box', 'second', 'season', 'coming', 'out', 'March', 'Now', 'few', 'minor', 'criticisms', 'Mind', 'criticisms', 'are', 'only', 'result', 'high', 'standards', 'box', 'set', 'first', 'place', 'First', 'only', 'three', 'twenty-four', 'episodes', 'have', 'commentary', 'Commentators', 'Allan', 'Burns', 'Jim', 'Brooks', 'David', 'Davis', 'Jay', 'Sandrich', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Mr.', 'Asner', 'repeatedly', 'called', 'bring', 'out', 'new', 'fascinating', 'details', 'background', 'tidbits', 'such', 'how', 'MTM', 'cat', 'was', 'filmed', 'how', 'much', 'respected', 'acting', 'talents', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'Cloris', 'Leachman', 'commentary', 'three', 'episodes', 'watching', 'other', 'twenty-one', 'more', 'difficult', 'find', 'wondering', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'said', 'uproarious', 'performance', 'Shelley', 'Berman', 'Divorce', ""n't"", 'Everything', 'many', 'other', 'excellent', 'scripts', 'guest', 'stars', 'course', 'season.Second', 'making', 'documentary', 'well-done', 'fascinating', 'left', 'out', 'key', 'material', 'Much', 'was', 'said', 'infamous', 'original', 'scene', 'filmed', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'flopped', 'only', 'stills', 'were', 'shown', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'scene', 'full', 'bonus', 'six', 'nearly', 'identical', 'CBS', 'promos', 'entertaining', 'were', '.Overall', 'five-star', 'product', 'five-star', 'show', 'appreciate', 'classic', 'television', 'want', 'watch', 'one', 'show', 'can', 'really', 'bring', 'back', '1970s', 'where', 'look']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season

Now you can do just that, because the entire first season of one of the best TV sitcoms of the '70s (with apologies to ""All in the Family"") has been released in a four DVD box set. We get to see the first embryonic episodes, where a wide eyed Mary Richards (in go-go boots, fur coat and a very short skirt) comes to cold Minneapolis to make a new life for herself. The TV viewer sees her move into the famous apartment with the big M and gets hired to work at WJM-TV, which produces the most (unintentionally) hilarious news broadcasts in town. And who can forget about Mary's gang of friends and co-workers who would eventually become her pseudo family? We get to see episode after episode, where Mr.Grant, Ted, Murray, Rhoda and of course Phyllis somehow gets the gal, ""who can turn the world on with her smile"", into some very hilarious and embarassing social situations!In all seriousness, this is the ground breaking TV show that launched the ideal that a single, independent women, could make it in the working world and not have to depend on a husband or boyfriend.It was done with wit, good writing and one of the best ensemble casts in the business.

Bernabo,"[6, 6]","The first season of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" (1970-71) find Mary Richards settling into her Minneapolis apartment and the WJM newsroom.  The balance between ""home"" and ""work"" is obviously reminiscent of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" which had made Mary Tyler Moore a household name as Laura Petrie.  The identification was so great that CBS nixed plans to make Mary Richards a divorce because they were worried American would think she had divorced Dick Van Dyke.  Instead it was decided Mary would break her engagement with her boyfriend and try to make it on her own.Most of the scripts this first season are written by James L. Brooks and Allan Burns, Treva Silverman, David Davis and Lorenzo Music, and Steve Pritzker.  The best episodes tend to focus on the trials and tribulations of Mary and neighbor Rhoda (Valerie Harper) as single women in their thirties, for which Silverman was usually the writer: Mary worries about being an old maid because a man in his twenties calls her ""ma'am'; Rhonda and Mary pretend to be divorced singles to get a cut-rate trip to Europe; Rhonda's boyfriend likes Mary better; the IRS agent auditing Mary is attracted to her; a young cameraman makes up stories about being romantically involved with Mary; the charming newsman Mary becomes involved with is married; and Mary dates her former boyfriend's brother.  This alone should convince you that the first season of ""MTM"" was atypical and not what you remember from its heyday.  Of course, during the first season the show was still developing the supporting characters and their relationships to one another, which is why you will find very few classic episodes of a show that was selected in 1985 as ""The Top TV Sitcom of All Time as Determined by the Nation's TV Critics.""The episodes from the first season of ""MTM"" are: (1) ""Love Is All Around""; (2) ""Today I Am a Ma'am""; (3) ""Bess, You Is My Daughter Now""; (4) ""Divorce Isn't Everything""; (5) ""Keep Your Guard Up""; (6) ""Support Your Local Mother""; (7) Toulouse-Laurtrec Is One of My Favorite Artists""; (8) ""The Snow Must Go On""; (9) Bob and Rhoda and Ted and Mary""; (10) ""Assistant, Wanted, Female""; (11) ""1040 or Fight""; (12) ""Anchorman Overboard""; (13) ""He's All Yours""; (14) ""Christmas and the Hard-Luck Kid""; (15) ""Howard's Girl""; (16) ""Party Is Such Sweet Sorrow""; (17) ""Just a Lunch""; (18) ""Second-Story Story""; (19) ""We Closed in Minneapolis""; (20) ""Hi!""; (21) ""The Boss Isn't Coming to Dinner""; (22) ""A Friend in Deed""; (23) ""Smokey the Bear Wants You"": (24) ""The Forty-Five-Year-Old-Man"".  Brooks and Burns who won the Emmy for their script ""Support Your Local Mother,"" in which Rhonda's mother (Nancy Walker) shows up and spends all her time with Mary when her daughter refuses to see her.""MTM"" finished in 22nd place in the Nielsens with a 20.3 rating (which would be good enough for 1st place today).

This DVD also includes some great bonus features, most notably the 88-minute feature on the making of season one. Very good. The quality of the DVDs is great as well. We can only hope and pray for seasons 2-7 to be released on DVD. With all of these other shows being released (even ""Green Acres"" and ""Dukes of Hazzard,"" which aren't even good shows-they can't compare with MTM!), I hope that Fox will soon produce more seasons of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show.""1. Love is All Around-After breaking up with her boyfriend, Mary moves to Minneapolis and gets a job as associate producer at WJM.2. Today I am a Ma'am-When a mailboy at WJM calls Mary ""ma'am,"" she realizes she's not so young anymore. Rhoda decides to take action on the situation, resulting in a hilariously awkward evening of ""dinner"" guests.3. Bess, You is My Daughter Now-Phyllis asks Mary to watch her bratty daughter Bess for a few days. Bess undergoes a transformation under Mary's care...then she doesn't want to go home.4. Divorce Isn't Everything-Mary and Rhoda join the Better Luck Next Time Club, a group for divorced people, so that they can get discounted charter flights to Europe. Of course, they're not divorced, so they constantly try to cover up the fact, and Mary feels guilty.5. Keep Your Guard Up-An ex-quarterback friend of Lou's comes to WJM and wants a job as a sportscaster. Mary volunteers to coach him.6. Support Your Local Mother-Rhoda's mother, Ida Morgenstern, comes to visit her, but Rhoda refuses to see her.  Ida winds up staying with Mary instead.7. Toulouse Lautrec is One of My Favorite Artists-Mary interviews a renowned author, and he subsequently asks her for a date. She accepts...but when he stands up, she discovers that he is six inches shorter than she is.8. The Snow Must Go On-During a blizzard, WJM has a partial power loss and is unable to broadcast election results.9. Bob and Rhoda and Teddy and Mary-Rhoda's new boyfriend is actually more interested in Mary, causing tension in their friendship.10. Assistant Wanted, Female-Mary hires Phyllis to be her assistant in the newsroom, but Phyllis refuses to do any tasks that Mary gives her. Instead, Phyllis devotes herself to Ted.11. 1040 or Fight-Mary is audited by a shy, stuttering accountant who develops a crush on her.12. Anchorman Overboard-Ted agrees to speak at Phyllis' women's club, but he gets stage fright.13. He's All Yours-Lou's college-age nephew, a cameraman at WJM, develops a crush on Mary.14. Christmas and the Hard Luck Kid-Mary has to work on Christmas all alone.15. Howard's Girl-Mary dates Howard Arnell's twin brother, Paul, who is much more suave and sophisticated. When Paul takes Mary home to meet his parents, the parents only talk about Howard, obviously the family favorite.16. Party is Such Sweet Sorrow-Mary accepts an offer at another TV station for a higher salary. WJM throws her a going-away party, and Mary gets tipsy.17. Just a Lunch-Mary has lunch with John Corcoran, a charming news correspondent, who is ""separated"" from his wife.18. Second Story Story-Mary's apartment is burglarized three times in rapid succession.19. We Closed in Minneapolis-Murray writes a play that is finally accepted for production with only one condition: Ted must be the star.20. Hi!-Mary has a tonsillectomy, but she has a grouchy roommate who thinks Mary is a go-go dancer.21. The Boss Isn't Coming to Dinner-Lou keeps dodging Mary's invitations to dinner. Mary finally finds out that Lou and Edie are separated.22. A Friend in Deed-Mary's old friend from summer camp, Twinks, gets a job as a receptionist at WJM. High-spirited Twinks forces her way back into Mary's life, much to Rhoda's dismay.23. Smokey the Bear Wants You-Rhoda begins dating an attractive, wealthy man, but she and Mary can't figure out what he does for a living.24. The 45-Year-Old Man-When Lou gets fired, Mary visits the owner of WJM, Wild Jack Monroe, asking him to give Lou his job back.Note: I couldn't figure out the cover of this boxed set. That photo of Mary has absolutely nothing to do with the show. It's not even an attractive photo.

When it finally came in the later fall of 2002, I was a little disappointed to have it play only one episode at a time instead of the terrific PLAY ALL.Nonetheless, it's a great show! Season 2 was supposed to come out on March 22, 2003, but never did~~ there was a web site you could go to in order to sign up for them to release further seasons. Season 2 didn't show up until this past June of 2005.Now Season 3 has just been released as of January 17th 2006!They are all SO CHEAP NOW!!

The pilot episode is one of the best ever made and the first season is filled with classic episodes.  Though it's a bit dated, it deals with some interesting issues that still apply in today's world.  Nothing on TV in the past couple decades compares to this series.  And in retrospect the Academy failed in the fact that it didn't win the Best Comedy Emmy in its first year (it was up against ground-break All in the Family, which now suffers by comparison).The DVD set doesn't have some of the normal things and this could be reissued with more extras.",5,First Season of TV's Greatest Adult Comedy,1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,652,"['see', 'how', 'adult', 'TV', 'comedy', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'done', 'buy', 'first', 'season', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'pilot', 'episode', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'made', 'first', 'season', 'filled', 'classic', 'episodes', 'bit', 'dated', 'interesting', 'issues', 'still', 'apply', 'today', 'world', 'Nothing', 'TV', 'past', 'couple', 'decades', 'series', 'retrospect', 'Academy', 'failed', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'Best', 'Comedy', 'Emmy', 'first', 'year', 'was', 'up', 'ground-break', 'Family', 'now', 'comparison', '.The', 'DVD', 'set', ""n't"", 'have', 'normal', 'things', 'could', 'be', 'reissued', 'more', 'extras']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season

I'm a huge fan of Nick at Nite and TV Land which is where I originally first saw the show and I really enjoyed the special cast, characters, episodes, moments, & memories from The Mary Tyler Moore Show. This first season is an instant smash hit! It by far has one of the best cast's ever developed for television and what ended up coming to be a part of TV history. Such stars are: Mary Tyler Moore, Ed Asner, Gavin MacLeod, Valerie Harper, Ted Knight, & Cloris Leachman. The time that the TV Show came out it was a luck of the draw for an independent woman type of show. However, I believe it's not only for women, but for everyone to enjoy. The network back at the time surely did take a risk and I'm very glad they did indeed and made it work. For those who are not familiar at all with the show please do take a risk. You won't be sorry you'll enjoy all of the episodes from season one. My favorite's include: Love Is All Around, Bess, You Is My Daughter Now, Divorce Isn't Everything, Support Your Local Mother, The Snow Must Go On, Second Story Story, Hi, A Friend in Deed, & Smokey The Bear Wants You.The Mary Tyler Moore show also had a wonderful supportive guest star's and also stemmed talent into today's generation. The comedy is at it's best and it's extremely fresh in a classic way. Plus, I think you can find yourself relating to either all of the characters or at least some of them.The DVD is very neat with all of the extra goodies. It has a few commentary's by the cast, a wonderful behind the scene's of the shows creation, and my favorite the trivia game. It really is enjoyable for everyone.

(Piece of trivia is that ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" never appears in the credits it only says Mary Tyler Moore.)The first scene is Mary arriving at her new apartment opening the curtains and there's Rhoda cleaning the windows.  While Phylis is introduced as her close friend, we all know that Rhoda will be her best friend.The next scene is the job interview which of course is a classic.  Mary answering Lou's questions one question late. Of course the scene ends with the classic line by Lou ""you got spunk, (Mary smiles) I hate spunk!"" (Another piece of trivia - Mary applies for a secretary job which Lou already filled.  But where was this secretary on the show?)Of course at work the cast of characters at work is just as diverse as home. Lou the gruff but loveable boss. Ted the incompetent newscaster, who thinks the only newscater that is better than him was Walter Cronkite. Gordy, the competent weatherman. And her soul mate Murray, the writer who has to find ways to write news that Ted can't flub.This show evenly balances her home life with her work life.  Some episodes are primarily at the apartment with Rhoda and Phyliss, some are primarily at work with Lou, Murray and Ted, and some combine both.The following are the key episodes:1. Love is All Around (Pilot) - see above3. Bess You is My Daughter Now - This is a send up the ""modern parenting techniques"".  Mary babysits Phylis' daughter Bess and Bess prefers Mary to Phylis.6. Support Your Local Mother - This introduces Ida Morgenstern (Nancy Walker) as Rhoda's mother.  They were smart keeping Walker around for the Rhoda spinoff!  (Trivia #3: They refer to Rhoda having two sisters and a bother)(Emmy Award Best Writing)7. Toulouse-Latrec is one of My Favorite Arists - Mary fills in for Ted during a taping of an interview show and falls for the guest until she finds out that he's a foot shorter than her.  Of course Mary is afraid to admit that this is an issue and dates him. (Funny scene when the program airs and Ted is inserted over Mary, they keep in the guest asking Mary out.)(Emmy Award Best Direction)9. Bob and Rhoda and Teddy and Mary - This is the first of a almost annual show, The Teddy Awards or The Teddy Awards disaster.17. Second-Story Story - Mary is burglarized (and Phlyis helped).24. The Forty Five Year Old Man - Lou is fired and Mary goes to the station owner Wild Jack Monroe (Everyone assumes that is what WJM stands for but it is never stated in the episode) to get Lou back.Extra Features:Documentary on the Mary Tyler Moore Show including interviews with everyone but Mary?All-Star Trivia Challange - Questions asked by cast members, producers, writers and directors (I got a perfect score!)Ed Asner and Valerie Harper's Emmy Award Speaches.This is a great collection of a classic 70's breakthrough comedy.",5,You Got Spunk,1125878400,"09 5, 2005",2005,2888,"['kid', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'Piece', 'trivia', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'never', 'credits', 'only', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'first', 'scene', 'Mary', 'arriving', 'new', 'apartment', 'opening', 'curtains', 'Rhoda', 'cleaning', 'windows', 'Phylis', 'introduced', 'close', 'friend', 'know', 'Rhoda', 'will', 'be', 'best', 'friend.The', 'next', 'scene', 'job', 'interview', 'course', 'classic', 'Mary', 'answering', 'Lou', 'questions', 'one', 'question', 'late', 'course', 'scene', 'classic', 'line', 'Lou', 'got', 'spunk', 'Mary', 'smiles', 'hate', 'spunk', 'piece', 'trivia', 'Mary', 'applies', 'secretary', 'job', 'Lou', 'already', 'filled', 'where', 'was', 'secretary', 'show', 'course', 'work', 'cast', 'characters', 'work', 'just', 'as', 'diverse', 'home', 'Lou', 'gruff', 'loveable', 'boss', 'Ted', 'incompetent', 'newscaster', 'who', 'only', 'newscater', 'better', 'was', 'Walter', 'Cronkite', 'Gordy', 'competent', 'weatherman', 'soul', 'mate', 'Murray', 'writer', 'who', 'find', 'ways', 'write', 'news', 'Ted', 'ca', ""n't"", 'flub.This', 'show', 'evenly', 'home', 'life', 'work', 'life', 'episodes', 'are', 'primarily', 'apartment', 'Rhoda', 'Phyliss', 'are', 'primarily', 'work', 'Lou', 'Murray', 'Ted', 'combine', 'both.The', 'following', 'are', 'key', 'episodes:1', 'Love', 'Around', 'Pilot', 'see', 'above3', 'Bess', 'Daughter', 'Now', 'send', 'up', 'modern', 'parenting', 'techniques', 'Mary', 'Phylis', 'daughter', 'Bess', 'Bess', 'prefers', 'Mary', 'Phylis.6', 'Support', 'Local', 'Mother', 'Ida', 'Morgenstern', 'Nancy', 'Walker', 'Rhoda', 'mother', 'were', 'smart', 'keeping', 'Walker', 'Rhoda', 'spinoff', 'Trivia', '3', 'refer', 'Rhoda', 'having', 'two', 'sisters', 'bother', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Writing', '7', 'Toulouse-Latrec', 'one', 'My', 'Favorite', 'Arists', 'Mary', 'fills', 'Ted', 'taping', 'interview', 'show', 'guest', 'out', 'foot', 'shorter', 'course', 'Mary', 'afraid', 'admit', 'issue', 'Funny', 'scene', 'when', 'program', 'airs', 'Ted', 'inserted', 'Mary', 'keep', 'guest', 'asking', 'Mary', 'out', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Direction', '9', 'Bob', 'Rhoda', 'Teddy', 'Mary', 'first', 'almost', 'annual', 'show', 'Teddy', 'Awards', 'Teddy', 'Awards', 'disaster.17', 'Second-Story', 'Story', 'Mary', 'burglarized', 'Phlyis', 'helped', '.24', 'Forty', 'Five', 'Year', 'Old', 'Man', 'Lou', 'fired', 'Mary', 'station', 'owner', 'Wild', 'Jack', 'Monroe', 'Everyone', 'what', 'WJM', 'never', 'stated', 'episode', 'get', 'Lou', 'back.Extra', 'Features', 'Documentary', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'Show', 'including', 'interviews', 'everyone', 'Mary', 'All-Star', 'Trivia', 'Challange', 'Questions', 'asked', 'cast', 'members', 'producers', 'writers', 'directors', 'got', 'perfect', 'score', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'Valerie', 'Harper', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'Speaches.This', 'great', 'collection', 'classic', '70', 'breakthrough', 'comedy']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season

I really don't think that even needs to be said, that's something we all know, and I think that's why we will probably see Fox change their decision on releasing the remaining seasons, if it is, in fact, in Fox's hands. It's hard to tell what could delay the release of a show of this stature and quality. Certainly they would have to know that there is a demand for it. I think if we're patient, eventually we will get the remaining episodes from this series.This sort of makes me think of the Badfinger skirmish back in the 70's and 80's. Their music was suddenly pulled from release for legal reasons while the demand was still high. The price for a Badfinger album went through the roof because there was no new product available. After probably close to 20 years everything was settled and their material was released on CD. I'm not implying that this might be the case here, but the demand was eventually satisfied. I think we'll eventually see that in this instance too, but it may be a while.

When we were introduced to Mary Richards, we quickly learned that she was just a girl from Roseburg, Minnesota who had spunk, a run in her hose and could instantaneously make us fall in love with her.  But Mary Richards was so much more; she represented a generation of women who came into their own, supported themselves and worked hard to create a career.  Mary was my own mom and many other women, and I wanted to be like them...and have spunk.The first season introduces us to Mary's newsroom job at WJM in Minneapolis and her open-spaced, charming apartment.  With that, came the best supporting cast in television:  Valerie Harper as her best friend- Rhoda, Ed Asner as her boss- Lou Grant, Cloris Leachman as friend and landlord- Phyllis, Gavin MacLeod as co-worker- Murray and Ted Knight as the self-enamored anchorman- Ted Baxter.This is an ensemble show, but Mary is the glue.  Her comedic timing is like a Swiss watch.  She is funny, but you also care about her, her dates, her work woes.  And though she's playing a young, single woman, she's always an adult with class.  There's such a stark contrast to today's shows where everyone seems endlessly immature & the focus is on sleaze.  Mary and her friends were smart, witty, zany and sometimes goofy but they were always grown-ups.The writing on this entire series is superb, and it can't be compared to anything we have on television today.  The first season started with a bang.  The characters evolved as the series went on, but from the start the actors were in full character.  There are 24 episodes and some are classics:  The first episode ""Love is All Around"" has the oft-repeated ""You've got spunk"" scene.  Another great one is ""The Snow Must Go On,"" where Ted ad-libs election results.

Rumors now circulate that Season 2 will eventually be released, but I have to question the genius of including a coupon for the Season 1 release inside this specific package.If people who are happy to have this starter set then already have all the Mary Tyler Moore which they want and series fans will buy the complete season releases anyways, the 'starter set' concept will not serve as a 'bridge' to increasing overall MTM DVD interest. Casual fans are not going to buy additional DVDs for something which they found only mildly interesting.Barring the VERY unusual and isolated case, people are not going to first buy this release and then the traditional DVD set. Since those people do not make up a market majority, I am curious how FOX believed this approach would power overall series sales.I could see the starter set in the mid 1990's or only selected episodes being released in lieu of entire seasons. I must question the relevancy of that strategy in 2005 and also in addition to full season releases of a series.",1,Who on earth authorized the 'starter set' concept?,1109635200,"03 1, 2005",2005,1295,"['personally', 'had', 'liked', 'selected', 'episodes', 'must', 'add', 'voice', 'chorus', 'people', 'who', 'also', 'see', 'marketing', 'flaws', 'what', 'really', 'are.Because', 'FOX', 'had', 'not', 'promoted', 'MTM', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'asking', 'lots', 'money', 'DVD', 'sales', 'were', 'slower', 'expected', '2002', 'Rumors', 'now', 'circulate', 'Season', '2', 'will', 'eventually', 'be', 'released', 'have', 'question', 'genius', 'including', 'coupon', 'Season', '1', 'release', 'specific', 'package.If', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'happy', 'have', 'starter', 'set', 'then', 'already', 'have', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'want', 'series', 'fans', 'will', 'buy', 'complete', 'season', 'releases', 'anyways', ""'starter"", 'set', 'concept', 'will', 'not', 'serve', ""'bridge"", 'increasing', 'overall', 'MTM', 'DVD', 'interest', 'Casual', 'fans', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'buy', 'additional', 'DVDs', 'something', 'found', 'only', 'mildly', 'interesting.Barring', 'VERY', 'unusual', 'isolated', 'case', 'people', 'are', 'not', 'going', 'first', 'buy', 'release', 'then', 'traditional', 'DVD', 'set', 'people', 'do', 'not', 'make', 'up', 'market', 'majority', 'am', 'curious', 'how', 'FOX', 'believed', 'approach', 'would', 'power', 'overall', 'series', 'sales.I', 'could', 'see', 'starter', 'set', 'mid', '1990', 'only', 'selected', 'episodes', 'being', 'released', 'lieu', 'entire', 'seasons', 'must', 'question', 'relevancy', 'strategy', '2005', 'also', 'addition', 'full', 'season', 'releases', 'series']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season
601371,A1VKBH6MFJGKKA,B00005JLIC,Rob Keil,"[15, 16]","Like many people, I was thrilled to hear that Fox was going to put out this set, but wondered exactly how well the final product would come off. After purchasing the set and watching a good portion of it I can certainly say that it met or exceeded all my expectations. The show itself, of course, is excellent, groundbreaking comedy with strong endearing characters and funny yet sophisticated writing.But beyond that, Fox has done an excellent job in bringing this show to DVD. I am extremely picky when it comes to picture quality, and I'll have to say the film transfer is absolutely beautiful, with razor-sharp focus, rich color, as well as deep blacks and clear highlights. I have never seen this show look so good. Generally the condition of the film seems excellent with only minor pinhole spots and a little dust. It's hard to believe the film is in such good condition after 30 years of storage and use. The quality of the audio is not quite as good, but this seems to have more to do with the acoustics of the original sound stage and not with the mastering of the DVD.The packaging is great, well designed and functional. There is a nice little booklet with all the expected information in it, as well as a nice note from Fox telling us we can expect the second season set to come out in March 2003.There are some really nice extras, including a substantial and insightful doucmentary on the making of the show, rare Emmy Awards footage, as well as some CBS promo tags and a small photo gallery. There are a few episodes with commentaries from David Davis, Ed Asner, and others affiliated with the show, and these are quite good, giving the viewer a solid understanding of the production process as well as the show's concept and casting decisions that led to the hiring of the now-legendary actors. I only wish every episode had a commentary.Overall, I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed with this DVD set. Even if you are not an avid fan of the show, you'll learn so much about the basics of good sitcom writing, pacing, acting, and prodcution, that it may be worth picking up this set just for that knowledge. The show's characters and style of humor really can grow on you. And if you already like the show, you'll love this set.I really hope that Fox will next turn their attention to The Bob Newhart Show, which is another excellent sitcom from MTM Productions made only 2 years later, with many of the same writers, directors, and producers. The Bob Newhart Show deserves this same top-quality treatment they have given Mary Tyler Moore.",5,"Great Show, Extremely Well Produced DVDs",1033084800,"09 27, 2002",2002,2561,"['many', 'people', 'was', 'thrilled', 'hear', 'Fox', 'was', 'going', 'put', 'out', 'set', 'wondered', 'exactly', 'how', 'well', 'final', 'product', 'would', 'come', 'off', 'purchasing', 'set', 'watching', 'good', 'portion', 'can', 'certainly', 'say', 'met', 'exceeded', 'expectations', 'show', 'course', 'excellent', 'groundbreaking', 'comedy', 'strong', 'endearing', 'characters', 'funny', 'yet', 'sophisticated', 'writing.But', 'Fox', 'done', 'excellent', 'job', 'bringing', 'show', 'DVD', 'am', 'extremely', 'picky', 'when', 'picture', 'quality', ""'ll"", 'have', 'say', 'film', 'transfer', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'razor-sharp', 'focus', 'rich', 'color', 'as', 'well', 'deep', 'blacks', 'clear', 'highlights', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'so', 'good', 'Generally', 'condition', 'film', 'excellent', 'only', 'minor', 'pinhole', 'spots', 'little', 'dust', 'hard', 'believe', 'film', 'such', 'good', 'condition', '30', 'years', 'storage', 'use', 'quality', 'audio', 'not', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'have', 'more', 'do', 'acoustics', 'original', 'sound', 'stage', 'not', 'mastering', 'DVD.The', 'packaging', 'great', 'well', 'designed', 'functional', 'nice', 'little', 'booklet', 'expected', 'information', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'note', 'Fox', 'telling', 'can', 'expect', 'second', 'season', 'set', 'come', 'out', 'March', '2003.There', 'are', 'really', 'nice', 'extras', 'including', 'substantial', 'insightful', 'doucmentary', 'making', 'show', 'rare', 'Emmy', 'Awards', 'footage', 'as', 'well', 'CBS', 'promo', 'tags', 'small', 'photo', 'gallery', 'are', 'few', 'episodes', 'commentaries', 'David', 'Davis', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'others', 'affiliated', 'show', 'are', 'quite', 'good', 'giving', 'viewer', 'solid', 'understanding', 'production', 'process', 'as', 'well', 'show', 'concept', 'casting', 'decisions', 'led', 'hiring', 'now-legendary', 'actors', 'only', 'wish', 'episode', 'had', 'commentary.Overall', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'being', 'disappointed', 'DVD', 'set', 'Even', 'are', 'not', 'avid', 'fan', 'show', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'so', 'much', 'basics', 'good', 'sitcom', 'writing', 'pacing', 'acting', 'prodcution', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'set', 'just', 'knowledge', 'show', 'characters', 'style', 'humor', 'really', 'can', 'grow', 'already', 'show', ""'ll"", 'love', 'set.I', 'really', 'hope', 'Fox', 'will', 'next', 'turn', 'attention', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'excellent', 'sitcom', 'MTM', 'Productions', 'made', 'only', '2', 'years', 'later', 'many', 'same', 'writers', 'directors', 'producers', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'same', 'top-quality', 'treatment', 'have', 'given', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season
601372,APBNLLYCJM8YE,B00005JLIC,"Roy Anderson ""War Buff - and civilian combatt...","[2, 3]","In the golden years of Television - indeed in the golden years of Entertainment  - quality was important. Performers on TV had honed their skills, during years of endeavour in halls and theatres across the country, perfecting their work. Musicians - of all forms of music - played proper instruments with virtuoso ability. Lyrics could be understood and the musical sound replicated  - because it was written down and 'scored'. Actors, musicians, dancers, etc., all had 'great ability'.Even in this milieu, some performers stood out as exceptional. When thoroughly competent TV directors and skilled television technicians were able to work with these outstanding performers, shows  of exceptional quality and were produced.Mary Tyler Moore had an ability and an aura about her that was rare. The 'situation comedy', a long cherished and much loved TV art-form, seemed to have been made for her and her many skills. Moore's first great TV success was in the Dick Van Dyke Show. Then, when she starred in her own shows, Moore was magnificent.The Mary Tyler Moore Show was produced and directd by consumate experts. Add to this a particularly high standing of casting, which ensured only the best supporting actors,and the Mary Tyler Moore Show was destined to be in the 'Top Flight' of its gendre.Importantly however, unlike the crass and peurile content of so much 'entertainment' today, the Mary Tyler Moore Show ( and other great shows of the era) contained no gratuitous violence, no explicit sex or nudity, and no foul or blasphemous language.

Until recently, the sets were also notorious for their high price tags. Today (three years later) the set is now reasonably affordable. About time, Fox.During the three years of waiting for the set's price to fall I kept tabs on the rave customer reviews over the picture and overall quality of the show. Having just recently completed the entire set, I'm glad to report that all of the praise is well-deserved. I'd forgotten just how funny and brilliantly structured the episodes were. Tons of great dialogue delivered by a talented & cohesive ensemble cast. So much talent in the cast that you'll be thinking about the DVDs for the spin-offs (Rhoda, Lou Grant, Phyllis) and other memorable ""future shows"" (Too Close For Comfort, The Love Boat) the stars would later go on to.The extras for this set are just as cool as the episodes themselves. Going thru them all was enjoyably satisfying, and not a ""chore"" as it can be sometimes with some other DVDs. Special Features include an all-new 87-minute ""Making of Season One"" documentary with exclusive cast and crew interviews, selected episode commentaries, Emmy Award show clips, trivia challenge, still gallery and more!

I took a chance and bought this one, and I couldn't have been more delighted with it.  The sound and picture are tremendous (a BIG improvement over the videotape set that was released several years ago) and the special features are above and beyond anything I've yet seen on other TV series DVDs.  And don't get me started on what a superb value this set is - you won't find another collection with so many extras for such a great price. If you're a TV comedy fan, do yourself a huge favor and buy this set...I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

But thank goodness for the amazing trend of TV shows coming into DVD, younger generations can now see all these wonderful shows. I fell in love with MAry Tyler Moore the moment I saw her in the very first episode, isn't she just one of the most appealing actresses ever! Just like Audrey Hepburn it's impossible to hate her. She is THE Girl Next Door of the Girl Next Doors.Some of my favorite episodes are of course The Pilot (which is I think one of the best pilots of any sitcom), Today I'm a Maam, Support Your Local Mother, Toulouse-Lautrec Is One of My Favorite Artists, Second-Story Story, and 1040 or Fight to name a few.MTMS has one of the best ensemble ever. I especially love Valerie Harper, her timing was spot on and seeing her now older she is just more beautiful than ever. She is totally aging gracefully. Ted Knight was just a riot. The dumbness of Woody Cheers) and Joey (Friends) can be traced to Ted Knight who mastered dumbness perfectly. Of course Cloris Leachman was always a delight to see. She was just hilarious. I love when she say things out of the blue or when she says unfunny stuffs that she thinks is funny.I just hope season 2 would be available soon. It would be a total shame if money is the reason for not releasing it.

But the winds of change were blowing, and The Mary Tyler Moore Show (MTM) was part of CBS's bid to gain a younger audience.  Surrounded by a relatively unknown cast, Mary Tyler Moore returned to TV in 1970, after previously staring in the Dick Van Dyke Show.  Her new program, like Van Dyke's, was low-key, warm, and built on solid writing, and character development.Mary Richards was an unmarried, independent woman, making her way in the world.  Fortunately, as the song says, ""love is all around"", and Mary finds a new home in Minneapolis, as a producer at WJM TV.  Rather than being hard, and fiercely independent, Mary was just a big hearted ""softie"", often too willing to sacrifice herself for others.  In doing so, she and the rest of the cast, found a place in the hearts of millions of viewers.The first season featured fine performances by guest stars like Monte Markum, John Shuck, Pat Carroll, Shelly Berman, Slim Pickens, and Nancy Walker as Rhoda's mother.  You also get an interesting look at fashion in the 70's.  Mary's wardrobe, is of course in the spotlight, but Rhoda, and Phyllis also provide some interesting looks as well.  Though it's hard to top Mary's pink nightgown, in the episode entitled ""Hi!"".The four DVD MTM set is a comprehensive package containing the 24 episodes arranged in broadcast order, with eight episodes per disc.  Commentary tracks on a few more episodes would have been nice.  The fourth disc contains extensive bonus material, primarily a comprehensive 87 minute retrospective feature that centers on the show's creative team of Allan Burns, and James L. Brooks.  It has interviews with Mary, and the rest of the primary cast, and members of the production staff.  The insight provided is tremendous, particularly the stories about how the various characters were cast.  A feature like this, adds so much to the package, and brings the experience of the show, full circle.  Produced by Ed Asner, it shows appreciation to the fans, and pays tribute to a classic program.  Too bad we don't see a feature like this more often in boxed sets.MTM occupies a special place in TV history, and provided a tremendous boost to the careers of so many of its cast, and launched several spin-offs as well.  This set is essential for MTM fans, as well as those who appreciate classy, well-written comedy.

Can you believe CBS almost didn't do the show, they didn't have confidence in it's producers/writers James L. Brooks and Allan Burns. Many of the shows were directed by Jay Sandrich and Alan Rafkin who brought out the best in this cast. One very important note, these shows are roughly 24 1/2 to 25 minutes long so if like me, you taped them from TV you will notice they are sometimes as much as 3 minutes shorter than the ones presented on these DVDs. They are edited on TV to squeeze in more commercials. Shame on you. I watched this show when it originally aired in 1970, I'm 45. A must DVD set for any fan, complete, unedited and clearer picture than ever before, like watching them anew. I have vague memories of the episodes I saw from it's original air date.

This is an abomination! Clearly one of the most classic series ever, it is a disgrace that the other seasons have not been briskly delivered, when shows like ""Punky Brewster"" and ""Gilligan's Island"" are covering store racks.This set here, the first, is without a doubt one of the best TV series DVD sets I have seen. The shows are all masterfully remastered, with gorgeous crisp picture and sound. It is a totally different experience watching these on disc then the muddy, faded prints that have been running on TV, in syndication for years. The extras are also a pleasure, and the making-of documentary is impressive (and they just cover the first season!).There is no question that this is in the top five best sitcoms ever, and that the rest of the series needs to be on DVD...pronto! I heard a rumor about the second season being released in two parts...to lower the cost. Pathetic. If that's the case, I think another studio should have been releasing this series to disc. With shows having the same number of episodes per season being released today, in the $30-40 range, I don't think it's necessary to do that. I think another studio (besides Fox) should take over and give us fans the deserving tribute for this show that we request.",5,Beautiful Set...where's the rest of the series?!,1104364800,"12 30, 2004",2004,1621,"['bought', 'set', 'day', 'was', 'released', 'saw', 'inner', 'card', 'announcing', 'second', 'season', 'following', 'Spring', 'thought', 'how', 'difficult', 'would', 'be', 'wait', 'six', 'months', 'next', 'season', 'Well', 'was', 'two', 'years', 'ago', 'not', 'only', 'season', 'two', 'DVD', 'never', 'seen', 'light', 'day', 'have', 'other', 'five', 'seasons', 'should', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'out', 'now', 'abomination', 'Clearly', 'one', 'most', 'classic', 'series', 'ever', 'disgrace', 'other', 'seasons', 'have', 'not', 'been', 'briskly', 'delivered', 'when', 'shows', 'Punky', 'Brewster', 'Gilligan', 'Island', 'are', 'covering', 'store', 'racks.This', 'set', 'here', 'first', 'doubt', 'one', 'best', 'TV', 'series', 'DVD', 'have', 'seen', 'shows', 'are', 'masterfully', 'remastered', 'gorgeous', 'crisp', 'picture', 'sound', 'totally', 'different', 'experience', 'watching', 'disc', 'then', 'muddy', 'faded', 'prints', 'have', 'been', 'running', 'TV', 'syndication', 'years', 'extras', 'are', 'also', 'pleasure', 'making-of', 'documentary', 'impressive', 'just', 'cover', 'first', 'season', 'question', 'top', 'five', 'best', 'sitcoms', 'ever', 'rest', 'series', 'be', 'DVD', 'pronto', 'heard', 'rumor', 'second', 'season', 'being', 'released', 'two', 'parts', 'lower', 'cost', 'Pathetic', 'case', 'think', 'studio', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'releasing', 'series', 'disc', 'shows', 'having', 'same', 'number', 'episodes', 'season', 'being', 'released', 'today', '30-40', 'range', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'necessary', 'do', 'think', 'studio', 'Fox', 'should', 'take', 'over', 'give', 'fans', 'deserving', 'tribute', 'show', 'request']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season

I've come back after a few days and have read the other reviews here, and literally, &quot;they took the words right out of my mouth&quot;.  WOW!  This set is great!  I never have seen these episodes look so brilliant, even with whatever TVLand or Nick did to them when they added them to their line-up.  I hadn't seen most of the first season (inclusive of the first episode, which I only saw for the first time two or three years ago), so this is a treat to get them all.  It is also nice to have the French and Spanish versions of the soundtrack to see how they played in different countries.  It is unusual to play the French track, and get the 2nd season version of the opening theme with no vocal.  All others have the first season version.  Sound quality is also marvelous.  I wish they were doing I LOVE LUCY like this vs. one DVD a few shows at a time, but you can't have everything.  Still, Lucy does appear in the Emmy sequences on the Bonus disc, with probably the best documentary on the series, superceding the recent anniversary specials on CBS and TVLand.  I hope they continue it season by season, as it was mentioned inside the package, Season Two comes out in March 2003.  Fabulous work and worth every penny.",5,SUPERIOR.

601394,A3ILFAT3HHYOXE,B00005JLIC,widowedwalker,"[27, 35]","The season 1 DVD of ""Mary Tyler Moore"" was terrific. But dont kid yourselves about Fox's dilly-dallying around in releasing season 2 (or subsequent years) of the show being about ""disappointing sales"" of S1: with a 35 year old show, they dont expect gang-buster sales, and they never get them, yet old shows are released en masse all the time nonetheless... The failure to turn-out season 2 (and beyond) of ""MTM"" is purely a  political thing we dont know the inside details about.(And FOX has not been quick to put much of any of the MTM Enterprises library out on DVD, have they?)As far as them doling out season 2 in a two-volume set? Look... I love ""Mary"" as much as anybody out there, but this is treating us like children. (And now, Fox representatives are talking as if they can't even remember the extras that Ed Asner's son, Matthew, produced a couple of years ago for the S2 DVD release... Baloney!) We're not talking about a new, multi-million dollar theatrical film release, folks....I hate to say this, because I want ""Mary"", too, but I say, ""dont even bother"" until FOX stops playing games and gets their in-house situation cleared up, especially regarding the MTM library.It's insulting to fans, and the 'explanations' are invalid, illogical and not factual.(And you can bet if this was coming from Warners or Columbia, the two most aggressive studios about getting their products out on DVD, we wouldn't be waiting--- and we wouldn't be deliberately ignored!)1/24/05 Update on above ""review"": Fox has announced ""Bob Newhart Show"" DVD, an MTM series--- so maybe now there's a little hope.",5,"Fox's reluctance to release more ""Moore""",1102204800,"12 5, 2004",2004,1602,"['season', '1', 'DVD', 'Mary', 'Tyler', 'Moore', 'was', 'terrific', 'dont', 'kid', 'yourselves', 'Fox', 'dilly-dallying', 'releasing', 'season', '2', 'subsequent', 'years', 'show', 'being', 'disappointing', 'sales', 'S1', '35', 'year', 'old', 'show', 'dont', 'expect', 'gang-buster', 'sales', 'never', 'get', 'yet', 'old', 'shows', 'are', 'released', 'masse', 'time', 'nonetheless', 'failure', 'turn-out', 'season', '2', 'MTM', 'purely', 'political', 'thing', 'dont', 'know', 'inside', 'details', 'FOX', 'not', 'been', 'quick', 'put', 'much', 'MTM', 'Enterprises', 'out', 'DVD', 'have', 'As', 'far', 'doling', 'season', '2', 'two-volume', 'set', 'Look', 'love', 'Mary', 'as', 'much', 'anybody', 'there', 'treating', 'children', 'now', 'Fox', 'representatives', 'are', 'talking', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'remember', 'extras', 'Ed', 'Asner', 'son', 'Matthew', 'produced', 'couple', 'years', 'ago', 'S2', 'DVD', 'release', 'Baloney', ""'re"", 'not', 'talking', 'new', 'multi-million', 'dollar', 'theatrical', 'film', 'release', 'folks', '.I', 'hate', 'say', 'want', 'Mary', 'too', 'say', 'dont', 'even', 'bother', 'FOX', 'playing', 'games', 'in-house', 'situation', 'cleared', 'up', 'especially', 'regarding', 'MTM', 'library.It', 'insulting', 'fans', ""'explanations"", 'are', 'invalid', 'illogical', 'not', 'factual', 'can', 'bet', 'was', 'coming', 'Warners', 'Columbia', 'two', 'most', 'aggressive', 'studios', 'getting', 'products', 'out', 'DVD', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'waiting', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'deliberately', 'ignored', '1/24/05', 'Update', 'review', 'Fox', 'announced', 'Bob', 'Newhart', 'Show', 'DVD', 'MTM', 'series', 'maybe', 'now', 'little', 'hope']",The Mary Tyler Moore Show - The Complete First Season
