What ever is on the other side of this life, I hope it is as good as this movie makes it out to be. I am also a Bruce Greenwood fan, he plays his roles understated in my opinion and that is plus.

1114541,A10VOS8C44AA56,B000XNLQKW,"Mahri Linn ""Mahri""","[6, 6]","This is well worth the watching.  Zachariah is a Soul Collector, one who arrives on earth to escort the dead to the other side.  This Soul Collector is a bit irresponsible and a problem to his boss, played by the always-fantastic Ozzie Davis.  He fails to show up to escort a dying man, who then miraculously recovers; so as a punishment from above, is sent to earth to learn about the living.  Bruce Greenwood is wonderful as Zach; his initial arrival as a human is something to watch - every texture, smell, feel is new to him and his expressions say it all.  There's the love story angle with Melissa Gilbert as a widow with a small son; both of whom begin to love Zach.  The choices he makes, the secret he must keep, and the mystery of why he's at this particular place on this particular time will keep the viewer interested up to the very end of the film.  A Must-See for Greenwood fans and for fans of an impossible-situation-how-will-this-work-out situation.  Why isn't this available to American audiences on DVD?????
