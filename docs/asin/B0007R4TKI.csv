Based on a true story (I very much enjoy films based on fact), following the plight of a young Private School teenagers' quest to take his boyfriend to the prom.  In taking his case public against the school (and Catholic church), and eventually to the courts, the young Marc Hall risks alienating friends, teachers, his family and the very partner he hopes to escort to his High School Prom.All the actors in the film are excellent in their roles.  It's a shame movies like this are not picked up by the major networks like ABC, NBC and CBS.  This is a film about human rights, Catholic Church injustice, and believing in yourself and who you are as a person.  The writing is outstanding, and while many scenes are dramatic and touching, there is ample humor to keep the movie light.  The ending is uplifting, and gives us all hope that one day no one shall be persecuted for being themselves.The movie hails from Canada, and while I would love to give this film 5 stars, it could be mistaken for an ABC Afterschool Special, Made-for-TV movie or an episode of DeGrassi Junior High (an excellent program in and of itself).

888526,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0007R4TKI,Grady Harp,"[7, 7]","PROM QUEEN succeeds not only because it is a controversial subject based on a true incident, but also because of the light touch director John L'Ecuyer adds to the dimension of storytelling.  Writers Michael MacLennan and  Kent Staines have pieced together the facts from a now famous 'hearing' in Quebec concerning one teenage boy's challenging the Catholic Church school policies about sexual preferences in preventing him from attending a highschool Prom and have fleshed out the characters to make the story not only meaningfully important but also entertaining.Marc Hall (Aaron Ashmore) is a fun-loving, blue-haired gay lad who has a partner Jason (Mac Fyfe) and is comfortable in a semi-closeted way, and who attends a Catholic highschool in Quebec.  He is fortunate to have a band of accepting and supporting friends like Beau (eye candy actor Trevor Blumas) and Carly (Tamara Hope) among others who encourage Marc to bring his boyfriend to the upcoming Prom. The school officials - principal and school board - are adamant that the Catholic Church regards same sex relationships as sin and refuse to allow Marc to consider attending the Prom with Jason.Marc decides to 'come out' to his parents Emily (Marie Tifo) and Audy (Jean Pierre Bergeron) and they warmly assure him they have known for years (""Your hair. It's blue. And you have a poster of Celine Dion on your wall. We know."") With the support of his friends and a gay lawyer Lonnie Winn (Scott Thompson), Marc agrees to challenge the school/church stance and in a touching courtroom drama Marc pleads his case.  Though due to the familiarity of the case the audience knows from the beginning that Marc Hall won his right to attend the Prom with Jason, it is in the telling that the story takes flight.Though 'made for TV' budgetary constraints and format are obvious, PROM QUEEN boasts some fine actors and manages to bring to the screen another important hallmark in the Human Rights field.  While some may avoid this film for fear of its being a 'gay movie', rest assured that the content is handled in a touching and realistic way.  Recommended for all audiences, especially the teens who need to see both sides of a  bit of history.

Based on the true story of Marc Hall, a gay Canadian student who challenged the Catholic Church when they refused to let him take his boyfriend to the high school prom, this is a loveable and cute comedy with heart. The film conveyed an important message and remained engrossing, but was hurt by the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie in Canada. The film seemed too short and choppy. None of the characters were fleshed out and subplots appeared and disappeared like crazy. I watched the 17-minute 'documentary' about the real Marc Hall and longed for what this movie could have been. Had this been longer and more fleshed out, it would have been a much stronger piece and not the fluff it is now. This is certainly a feel-good story that will inspire many gay teens, but it had the chance to be something great and it felt short, for no other reason than the fact that it was a TV Movie.

Based on a true story of a senior Catholic high school student in a small town (Oshawa) in the province of Ontario (south of Toronto), Canada, it depicts a confrontation between law and religion.Marc is a highly intelligent kid in a Catholic high school, he is gay.Marc has a boyfriend Jason (Mac Fyfe) who he wants to take to the prom. The principal and the board of directors of the school are totally opposed basing their argument on the Church's position on homosexuality. Marc's friends at school are all out to help him so that he can take Jason to the prom. From the collection of eye candy kids, the movie moves along proving the strong family relation between Marc and his accepting parents, the Canadian Union representative at Marc's father local factory who backs him up all the way, the sleazy lawyer who helps taking the case to court and get a moment of fame himself.The movie is lite even though of the very controversial subject. Marc wins his case but not before he realizes that in his selfish act he forgets about other people's feelings. The movie is obviously a very strong political statement about gay rights, but, the ending proves that sometimes we win if we fight for what we believe in. Marc loose his chance for a scholarship through the school but is backed by a Canadian Union and receives a scholarship through them, making that the fight was worthwhile. Oh yes, he does take Jason to the prom.This is a great movie for high school gay teens, showing them not to give up in their beliefs. In a couple scenes there is the religious undertone of Marc being chosen for this purpose. All the actors are very cute, a tradition kept in movies.
