7353,A2582KMXLK2P06,076780337X,B. E Jackson,"[1, 3]","The main problem with Excess Baggage is how the film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be.  Is it a comedy?  It fails in this regard because it's not funny.  Is it serious?  The storyline is about a girl being kidnapped (Alicia Silverstone's character) but it *can't* be serious if the movie writers try implementing comedy bits the entire time the kidnapping is taking place.Therefore... the entire movie feels kind of pointless to me, and furthermore, trying to combine two different styles (comedy and drama) makes it hard for viewers to figure out exactly which direction the writers were going for when creating this storyline.The whole movie has a very weak storyline.  A woman is kidnapped, but not taking it seriously at *all* because of the comedy aspects, so she does things such as deliberately handcuff herself to the car, swallows a key, and the ""bad guy"" (a young punk who's about as theatening as a sweat bee) has no choice but to go through with the kidnapping.Yeah, eventually the bad guy decides to free Alicia's character, but she declines... I guess because she's developed a crush on the kidnapper.  Such a bad idea for a storyline it's not even funny... literally, and fails twice as hard as a result.Excess Baggage also feels like wasted potential on the part of Christopher Walken, who's obvious a much better actor than he portrays in this movie.  Everything about the movie seems to focus on how attractive Alicia Silverstone is and putting the spotlight on her above everyone else, and that's the problem with it.  Yes, she's very attractive, but that doesn't mean the storyline suddenly becomes interesting.  We need *something* to work with here!I say skip this one.

7356,A1LBF5XZNYD6QR,076780337X,Brett Johnson,"[26, 27]","&quot;Excess Baggage&quot; is the type of movie that failed at the box office due to poor marketing.  With the combination of Alicia Silverstone in a lead role and a trailer suggesting that this was mostly a comedy, I think a lot of people went into this flick with a wrong impression.  I know I did.  The first time I saw it I was rather disappointed.  There was nothing inherently wrong with any performance or any facet of the movie itself.  I think it was more that it wasn't what I expected.  Luckily, I decided to let some time pass and view it again.  I'm very glad I did because this is actually a solid movie.  The role of the bratty rich kid was, of course, perfect for Alicia and she didn't have to stretch much to properly play the part.  Benicio Del Toro was simply amazing!  His mannerisms for his character are something you simply can't be taught.  Del Toro is the real deal and you can't help but fall for his charm...even if he is playing a car thief.  It goes without saying that Christopher Walken is flawless as usual.  The guy's been around forever because he is one of the best acting talents in Hollywood.  The story certainly has some amusing moments and situations.  However, this is a story that's actually about love, loyalty and knowing your place in the world.  By all appearances, Alicia Silverstone and Benicio Del Toro would make quite the unconvincing couple.  As the movie progresses, however, you are truly moved by the bond that they form.  &quot;Excess Baggage&quot; is a very special film that deserves an open mind and a keen eye for amazing acting and appreciation of a multi-layered storyline filled with deep moments.",4,Fantastic the second time around.,1011657600,"01 22, 2002",2002,1660,"['quot', 'Excess', 'Baggage', 'quot', 'type', 'movie', 'failed', 'box', 'office', 'due', 'poor', 'marketing', 'combination', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'lead', 'role', 'trailer', 'suggesting', 'was', 'mostly', 'comedy', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'went', 'flick', 'wrong', 'impression', 'know', 'did', 'first', 'time', 'saw', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'was', 'nothing', 'inherently', 'wrong', 'performance', 'facet', 'movie', 'think', 'was', 'more', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'Luckily', 'decided', 'let', 'time', 'pass', 'view', 'again', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did', 'actually', 'solid', 'movie', 'role', 'bratty', 'rich', 'kid', 'was', 'course', 'perfect', 'Alicia', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'stretch', 'much', 'properly', 'play', 'part', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', 'mannerisms', 'character', 'are', 'something', 'simply', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taught', 'Del', 'Toro', 'real', 'deal', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'fall', 'charm', 'even', 'playing', 'car', 'thief', 'saying', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'flawless', 'usual', 'guy', 'been', 'around', 'forever', 'one', 'best', 'acting', 'talents', 'Hollywood', 'story', 'certainly', 'amusing', 'moments', 'situations', 'However', 'story', 'actually', 'about', 'love', 'loyalty', 'knowing', 'place', 'world', 'appearances', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'would', 'make', 'quite', 'unconvincing', 'couple', 'movie', 'however', 'are', 'truly', 'moved', 'bond', 'form', 'quot', 'Excess', 'Baggage', 'quot', 'very', 'special', 'film', 'open', 'mind', 'keen', 'eye', 'amazing', 'acting', 'appreciation', 'multi-layered', 'storyline', 'filled', 'deep', 'moments']",N/A

Too bad dad's a shady businessman who cares more about making millions illegally than he does about his own daughter. But one day Emily comes up with a plan that she hopes will change all that. She's going to fake her own kidnapping, demand a million dollar ransom and then be reunited with her father on live TV. Dad's image needs a makeover since he's under investigation by the SEC. Trouble is, on the way to her fake kidnapping, Emily gets kidnapped for real by a car thief named Vincent (Benicio Del Toro). Now Vincent doesn't know he's kidnapped her and it's not till after he gets the car to his shop that he makes the startling discovery. She thinks he's one of her father's goons. He thinks she's crazy. The two spar verbally and physically until Vincent's partner (Harry Connick, Jr.) shows up to try and calm the situation down. Turns out him and Vincent owe a mobster named Dokus some serious cash that they don't have, so they figure they'll use Emily as a bargaining chip to try and squeeze some more money out of her old man. Problem is he could care less. He doesn't believe for a second his daughter has been kidnapped and just figures she's trying to get more money out of him. Thankfully her uncle Ray (Christopher Walken) swoops in to try and get her back. And so begins a quasi-Into The Night movie as Vincent and Emily make their way to Vincent's cabin to try to figure out what to do while being pursued by both Ray and a couple of dim-witted mobsters (Nicholas Turturro, Michael Bowen).Inevitably Vincent and Emily fall for each other and inevitably their love is tested when Ray eventually catches up to them. Nothing in the film is very original or all that exciting for that matter, but it still has a strange charm all its own. While not everything works - the pace often lags and the plot is still a mess even with the Aaron Sorkin re-writes -  enough stuff does to make this movie enjoyable. Silverstone is great to look at but painful to listen to. Del Toro really channels his idol Brando delivering a mumbling, brooding - and I guess to the ladies - irresistible performance. Connick, Jr. is very smooth and funny in his supporting role. And then, of course, there's Walken. He delivers one of his trademark oddball performances. His uncle Ray is slightly goofy yet slightly scary as well. You don't get more twisted and eccentric than his scenes with not only Del Toro, but with Sally Kirkland as well. It's no surprise that Walken has most of the film's best lines. The direction by Marco Brambilla - he of 'Demolition Man' - is slick making everything look cool and stylish. 'Excess Baggage' is a movie that defines the term ""sleeper hit"". It will either put you to sleep with its slow pace and confusing plot twists or it will make a fan out of you thanks to its quirky charms.

Her take on the confident, chain-smoking, punch drunk, black mascara-ed Emily is fantastic, as is, surprisingly, her sense of comic timing.Some reviewers have been conservative with their alloted reviewer's stars on grounds that Ben Del Toro was 'inarticulate.' Well, he is as inarticulate as Robert DeNiro in Jackie Brown. Only, we're calling it understated subtlety these days. He hits just the right notes in portraying the goofball charm of a fundamentally gentlemanly car thief pitted against more convoluted criminals.Between them, Silverstone and Del Toro barely sound like a quixotic matchup but under the hood of this stolen car is a riveting romantic comedy leaking like excess oil. Only, my lousy metaphor spells automotive problems, the film does not.Take it for a spin, great bet for a fun weekend rental.

7367,A3I69IXPTDVKQF,076780337X,Stephen B. O'Blenis,"[3, 4]","This one outdid my expectations by quite a bit.  Alicia Silverstone stars as a teenage girl looking for more attention from her father, who tries to get it by locking herself in a car trunk and faking her own kidnapping.  Her plans go somewhat awry when the car is stolen for real.  The blueprint of this sounds like it could have gone sour very easily; the girl could have come off as very unlikable although that seemed much less of a probability with the charming Silverstone playing her, in full 'cute-and-feisty' mode.  And while car thieves don't exactly rank high on my list of potential male leads for a romantic comedy, Benicio Del Toro somehow manages to pull off the trick of making the character likable as he tries to dig both himself and Emily (Silverstone's character) out of deeper and deeper - and more dangerous - trouble.  The characters have real chemistry and click both comedically and romantically, and Christopher Walken excels as the character sent out by Emily's father to rescue her.One of the relatively few top-notch comedies to emerge from the second half of the 90s; highly recommended.",4,Great Ride Of A Movie - Silverstone's Best Comedy,1127347200,"09 22, 2005",2005,1117,"['one', 'outdid', 'expectations', 'quite', 'bit', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'teenage', 'girl', 'looking', 'more', 'attention', 'father', 'who', 'get', 'locking', 'car', 'trunk', 'faking', 'own', 'kidnapping', 'plans', 'go', 'somewhat', 'awry', 'when', 'car', 'stolen', 'real', 'blueprint', 'could', 'have', 'gone', 'sour', 'very', 'easily', 'girl', 'could', 'have', 'come', 'off', 'very', 'unlikable', 'seemed', 'much', 'less', 'probability', 'charming', 'Silverstone', 'playing', 'full', ""'cute-and-feisty"", 'mode', 'car', 'thieves', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'rank', 'high', 'list', 'potential', 'male', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Benicio', 'Del', 'Toro', 'somehow', 'pull', 'off', 'trick', 'making', 'character', 'likable', 'dig', 'Emily', 'Silverstone', 'character', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'more', 'dangerous', 'trouble', 'characters', 'have', 'real', 'chemistry', 'click', 'comedically', 'romantically', 'Christopher', 'Walken', 'excels', 'character', 'sent', 'out', 'Emily', 'father', 'rescue', 'her.One', 'relatively', 'few', 'top-notch', 'comedies', 'emerge', 'second', 'half', '90s', 'highly', 'recommended']",N/A

7369,A6VXZ1EEPRTLV,076780337X,trebe,"[2, 5]","""Excess Baggage"" is the first project of Alicia Silverstone's First Kiss production company.  This tale of a fouled up ""kidnapping"" is definitely lightweight fare, with a minimal amount of substance.  Unless you a really a fan of Alicia Silverstone or Benico Del Toro, you may want to pass on this one.Silverstone is Emily, a rich kid neglected by her father.  Her plan is to fake her kidnapping, and win Daddy's affection upon her safe return.  He's involved in some rather shady business deals, and can afford the ransom payment of a million dollars.  Emily binds herself with tape, and locks herself in the trunk of her BMW.  While waiting to be recovered by the police, the car is stolen by Vincent (Del Toro) a professional car thief.  From this somewhat interesting premise not a lot happens that is either funny, or exciting.The movie attempts, but does not succeed in creating a warm and romantic relationship between the two leads.  Failing to achieve this, we are left with a barely average comedy adventure.  Silverstone's performance does have some charm, and though her character is a bit odd, she rarely becomes irritating.  She is a fashion casualty though.  Unfortunately the chemistry with Vincent just doesn't develop as intended.  Vincent mumbles and bumbles, and seems none too bright.  You watch him wondering just how weird he actually is.  He never offends, but neither does he charm you.  It just seems his brain is working in a lower gear most of the time, except when it comes to the subject of serving jail time, which definitely gets his full attention.Chris Walken is Emily's Uncle Ray, a slick operator with an inflated opinion of himself, who never lives up to the hype.  He works for Emily's father, and has a better relationship with her than her own father.  He looks into the kidnapping on his own, providing yet another odd character to watch.The conclusion is as unsatisfying as the rest of the movie.  The kidnapping is somehow pinned on others, leaving Vincent in the clear.  Though exactly how this is accomplished is never explained.  That there is no happy reunion between father and daughter is no real loss.  All Vincent's other troubles have vanished, and he and Emily finish the movie together in the trunk of her car.I wanted to like this movie.  With better writing, one could easily see how the ""Vincent"" role could have really been something special, and taken over the movie.  Instead he's just a harmless mumbler.  Alicia Silverstone does a competent enough acting job, playing the spoiled misunderstood brat, trying (sometimes too hard) to bring out Vincent's inner charm.  It this case, it's almost a lost cause.",2,No sparks...,1019433600,"04 22, 2002",2002,2666,"['Excess', 'Baggage', 'first', 'project', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'First', 'Kiss', 'production', 'company', 'tale', 'fouled', 'up', 'kidnapping', 'definitely', 'lightweight', 'fare', 'minimal', 'amount', 'substance', 'really', 'fan', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'Benico', 'Del', 'Toro', 'may', 'want', 'pass', 'one.Silverstone', 'Emily', 'rich', 'kid', 'neglected', 'father', 'plan', 'fake', 'kidnapping', 'win', 'Daddy', 'affection', 'safe', 'return', 'involved', 'rather', 'shady', 'business', 'deals', 'can', 'afford', 'ransom', 'payment', 'million', 'dollars', 'Emily', 'tape', 'trunk', 'BMW', 'waiting', 'be', 'recovered', 'police', 'car', 'stolen', 'Vincent', 'Del', 'Toro', 'professional', 'car', 'thief', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'premise', 'not', 'lot', 'funny', 'exciting.The', 'movie', 'attempts', 'not', 'succeed', 'creating', 'warm', 'romantic', 'relationship', 'two', 'leads', 'Failing', 'achieve', 'are', 'left', 'barely', 'average', 'comedy', 'adventure', 'Silverstone', 'performance', 'have', 'charm', 'character', 'bit', 'odd', 'rarely', 'irritating', 'fashion', 'casualty', 'Unfortunately', 'chemistry', 'Vincent', 'just', ""n't"", 'develop', 'intended', 'Vincent', 'mumbles', 'bumbles', 'none', 'too', 'bright', 'watch', 'wondering', 'just', 'how', 'weird', 'actually', 'never', 'neither', 'charm', 'just', 'brain', 'working', 'lower', 'gear', 'most', 'time', 'when', 'subject', 'serving', 'jail', 'time', 'definitely', 'full', 'attention.Chris', 'Walken', 'Emily', 'Uncle', 'Ray', 'slick', 'operator', 'inflated', 'opinion', 'who', 'never', 'up', 'hype', 'Emily', 'father', 'better', 'relationship', 'own', 'father', 'kidnapping', 'own', 'providing', 'yet', 'odd', 'character', 'watch.The', 'conclusion', 'as', 'unsatisfying', 'rest', 'movie', 'kidnapping', 'somehow', 'pinned', 'others', 'leaving', 'Vincent', 'clear', 'Though', 'exactly', 'how', 'accomplished', 'never', 'explained', 'happy', 'reunion', 'father', 'daughter', 'real', 'loss', 'Vincent', 'other', 'troubles', 'have', 'vanished', 'Emily', 'finish', 'movie', 'together', 'trunk', 'car.I', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'better', 'writing', 'one', 'could', 'easily', 'see', 'how', 'Vincent', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'been', 'something', 'special', 'taken', 'over', 'movie', 'Instead', 'just', 'harmless', 'mumbler', 'Alicia', 'Silverstone', 'competent', 'enough', 'acting', 'job', 'playing', 'spoiled', 'misunderstood', 'brat', 'trying', 'sometimes', 'too', 'hard', 'bring', 'out', 'Vincent', 'inner', 'charm', 'case', 'almost', 'lost', 'cause']",N/A
