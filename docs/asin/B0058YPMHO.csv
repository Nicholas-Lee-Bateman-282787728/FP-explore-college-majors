The episode BRIAN AND STEWIE, that is what happened. It divided the series into those who found the realistic writing and depressing nature of that unique episode combined with a truly (for FOX) offensive scene in which Brian eats Stewie's Poop--""soured"" the network form letting them ""go too far"" anymore. No more drug episodes, no more ethnic humlor, no more religious mocks. No more anything too controversial.  So what could they do...right---what we get here.  A bland mess of shows, mostly awful with little edge or point. Brian Writes a Best Seller is the best of the lot, along with the Christmas Episode..but there's not much more of interest or comedy. Most episodes are awful in this lot. When you reach a point that turns off 50% of your audience 'when you cross the line"" as in Brian and Stewie, we get to this stage. South Park reached the same problem after the ""Muhammad"" (in a bear suit) episode where Comedy Central forced them to NEVER air episode 200 again UNCUT.

1447415,A4K29IAHJDRI3,B0058YPMHO,Male Order Bride,"[19, 32]","I loved the earlier seasons of Family Guy...but something about this Volume left me disappointed.The Writers are obviously running out of ideas, so they are re-using previous storylines. In earlier seasons, Lois becomes a Karate Champion. In this season, she becomes a Boxing Champion. In earlier seasons, Meg becomes romantically-obsessed with Brian. In this season, she becomes romantically-obsessed with Joe. Why didn't the Writers try something different and make Peter do boxing or get Chris to become obsessed with Bonnie? At least that wouldn't be similar to what they have already done. They played it too safe.Also, the original joke of Peter injuring his knee and lying on the ground in pain sighing for an uncomfortably long time was funny in the first few seasons...but similar gags just seem like the Writers were low on material, so they put in a long, awkward gag to fill-out time. The ""fight"" between Herbert and the Nazi is excruciating...not funny.Plus, I found the Christmas Special Episode bizarre. The gory way in which Brian and Stewie hack up a husband on Xmas Eve and orphan his child would be funny if it was a brief gag. I am no prude, but they drag it out to a five minute realistic torture-spree that drags on too long and isn't funny anymore...but depressing! And I know most Family Guy episodes don't make sense, but this episode's final moral is ""Christmas would be better if everyone only got one Gift each""? Huh? And another episode has a horrible moral that ""Paraplegics should try and learn to walk, and then their wife won't cheat on them""!!Something about this season was definately off-putting. I actually prefer American Dad now, because the Writers make stories that are fun and carefree...not bloody and trying to ""gross-out"" the audience like Family Guy.",1,Deja Vu...,1336348800,"05 7, 2012",2012,1796,"['loved', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Family', 'Guy', 'something', 'Volume', 'left', 'disappointed.The', 'Writers', 'are', 'obviously', 'running', 'ideas', 'are', 're-using', 'previous', 'storylines', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Lois', 'Karate', 'Champion', 'season', 'Boxing', 'Champion', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Meg', 'romantically-obsessed', 'Brian', 'season', 'romantically-obsessed', 'Joe', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'Writers', 'try', 'something', 'different', 'make', 'Peter', 'do', 'boxing', 'get', 'Chris', 'become', 'obsessed', 'Bonnie', 'least', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'similar', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'done', 'played', 'too', 'safe.Also', 'original', 'joke', 'Peter', 'injuring', 'knee', 'lying', 'ground', 'pain', 'sighing', 'uncomfortably', 'long', 'time', 'was', 'funny', 'first', 'few', 'seasons', 'similar', 'gags', 'just', 'seem', 'Writers', 'were', 'low', 'material', 'put', 'long', 'awkward', 'gag', 'fill-out', 'time', 'fight', 'Herbert', 'Nazi', 'excruciating', 'not', 'found', 'Christmas', 'Special', 'Episode', 'bizarre', 'gory', 'way', 'Brian', 'Stewie', 'hack', 'up', 'husband', 'Xmas', 'Eve', 'orphan', 'child', 'would', 'be', 'funny', 'was', 'brief', 'gag', 'am', 'prude', 'drag', 'out', 'five', 'minute', 'realistic', 'torture-spree', 'too', 'long', ""n't"", 'funny', 'anymore', 'depressing', 'know', 'most', 'Family', 'Guy', 'episodes', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'sense', 'episode', 'final', 'moral', 'Christmas', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'everyone', 'only', 'got', 'one', 'Gift', 'Huh', 'episode', 'horrible', 'moral', 'Paraplegics', 'should', 'try', 'learn', 'walk', 'then', 'wife', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cheat', 'Something', 'season', 'was', 'definately', 'off-putting', 'actually', 'prefer', 'American', 'Dad', 'now', 'Writers', 'make', 'stories', 'are', 'fun', 'carefree', 'not', 'bloody', 'trying', 'gross-out', 'audience', 'Family', 'Guy']","Family Guy, Volume Ten"

I wonder sometimes if my son isn't trying the same things when I'm not looking. This season has a few glowing moments. There are fourteen episodes and lots of bonus footage.

1447422,A3VIHZUSNOGWFY,B0058YPMHO,Peter Olafson,"[19, 26]","Quality-wise, this three-disc collection, already out in the UK, is a very mixed bag. The only true candidate for classic status among these 14 epsiodes (the remainder of Season Nine) is Brian Writes a Best-Seller, a brilliant comeuppance for the more than usually full-of-himself pooch. The rest are uneven. True, Halloween on Spooner Street has moments, Road to the North Pole improves on re-acquaintance -- as usual, the DVD episodes are raunchier than the broadcast versions -- and it's rare that you'll go all the way through an episode without one clever bit (like Patrick Warburton's linebacker-like version of the American Dad theme in the finale Foreign Affairs). But too many of the later ones come off like filler. For instance, the fight sequence in German Guy far exceeds its comedic life, while the full Jagger/Bowie Dancing in the Street video in Foreign Affairs is time-marking pure and simple. The extras provide some relief: outtakes from 13 episodes, select-scene animatics for two, the cross-promotional Beer Walk episode from The Cleveland Show (S2E9) and, when used on a DVD-ROM equipped PC, 15 clips, five clip mashups and nine songs (all exportable). And at least subsequent DVD releases should finally get back to a convenient seasonal basis for the first time since Vol. 2.
