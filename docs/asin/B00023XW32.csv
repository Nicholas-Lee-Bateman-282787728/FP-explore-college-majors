They encounter mysterious government types who are determined to convince Bishop and his men that they saw nothing out of the ordinary. Meanwhile, Colonel Moore (Glenn Ford- AN EXPERIMENT IN TERROR) sets out to get to the bottom of things. THE DISAPPEARANCE OF FLIGHT 412 is a decent made-for-TV movie from the early 70s. The only drawbacks are the cheeezy narration, and the fact that nothing much really happens. It's mostly concerned w/ government cover-up than actual UFOs.

823743,A2NOZB6VZCTOI4,B00023XW32,Robert I. Hedges,"[3, 5]","""The Disappearance of Flight 412"" is a 1974 piece of garbage about UFOs and a big government conspiracy starring Glenn Ford (!), David Soul, and Bradford Dillman. As a current airline pilot and former Air Force officer and pilot, all I have to say on the technical merits of this film is that it's pure junk. The film starts with ponderous narration about the UFO threat and hokey airplane footage, and goes downhill into government conspiracy theory territory from there. Not that I will dwell on it, but the airplane related babble from pilot David Soul and crew, especially the bit about blindly following the instructions from an unknown entity called ""Digger Control"", is beyond painful.Soul and crew land at an unknown military field and are interviewed by government agents, who interrogate them brutally by taking them to comfortable briefing rooms and giving them coffee and light refreshments. Immediately one of the crewmembers cracks under the pressure, despite the interrogation being laughable on a number of planes (you'll pardon the pun). Glenn Ford shows up to rescue his men (which is a good thing as David Soul came up with the stupidest escape plan ever) triggering an idiotic prisoner release plotpoint. (They were held for a whole 18 hours, although the film makes is seem like much less.)The conclusion involves a wholly predicable plot twist (I loved the Top Secret documents kept in a dresser drawer, by the way) involving more narration and general wincing from the audience.This movie is just horrendous: the transfer is bad, but the best transfer in history couldn't make up for the fact that you are watching a steaming heap of dung.

Such tactics are occasionally employed in the name of ""national security"" which has become a ruse under which corrupt authorities operate. The official lies of 9/11 are a good example. Searching the history of UFOs reveals a lot of similar circumstances (Mantell, Louette, Rendlesham-1980, etc.) Military personnel that witness such unfortunate events frequently have their careers irrevocably harmed and the personnel know it. Ask the witnesses of the Rendlesham Forest incident in 1980. ;) The acting in this movie is solid whether the screenplay is totally accurate or not. I've seen much worse quality in both acting and production. However, I can't speak about the quality of transfer to DVD as I watched this movie online. Personally, I want to buy a copy on DVD, but not if the quality is poor...Update: Well, since Mill Creek's 100 Sci-Fi Classics includes the Disappearance of Flight 412 and the price was discounted to $20, I decided to buy that collection. The transfer to DVD is likely a generational copy of a VHS so the movie is blurry on modern equipment. Judicious use of software controls, e.g. de-interlacing, results in a tolerable viewing experience. It could be worse and it could be better. I still like the movie even with the mediocre transfer.
