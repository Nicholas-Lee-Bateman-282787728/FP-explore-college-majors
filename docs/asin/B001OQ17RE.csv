It deals with alcoholism and infidelity4. But mostly it's a debate on the value of the AA programme5. I would have fallen asleep, but zinc beds are too darned uncomfortableSlow moving, rather dry British movie fails to hold the viewer's interest despite the efforts of Jonathan Pryce as a somewhat annoying wealthy businessman and Uma Thurman as his trophy wife.  Paddy Considine's character runs the gamut from boring to blotto to bewildered, stopping just a tad short of believable.I've read that the original play is bewitching, but the magic certainly hasn't transferred to the big screen.Recommended only as punishment for alcoholics and cheaters.Amanda Richards, April 10, 2009",2,To AA or not to AA,1239321600,"04 10, 2009",2009,812,"['Short', 'Attention', 'Span', 'Summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'play', 'David', 'Hare2', 'three', 'characters3', 'alcoholism', 'infidelity4', 'mostly', 'debate', 'value', 'AA', 'programme5', 'would', 'have', 'fallen', 'asleep', 'zinc', 'beds', 'are', 'too', 'darned', 'uncomfortableSlow', 'moving', 'rather', 'dry', 'British', 'movie', 'hold', 'viewer', 'interest', 'efforts', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'somewhat', 'annoying', 'wealthy', 'businessman', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'trophy', 'wife', 'Paddy', 'Considine', 'character', 'gamut', 'boring', 'blotto', 'bewildered', 'stopping', 'just', 'tad', 'short', 'believable.I', ""'ve"", 'read', 'original', 'play', 'bewitching', 'magic', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'transferred', 'big', 'screen.Recommended', 'only', 'punishment', 'alcoholics', 'cheaters.Amanda', 'Richards', 'April', '10', '2009']",My Zinc Bed

1223011,A2FUOXFJ74B32M,B001OQ17RE,"P.K. Ryan ""The Ryan Identity""","[3, 6]","This short HBO film is based on a play by David Hare. It's a somewhat bizzare story of an alcoholic poet (Considine) who comes into contact with a powerful businessman (Pryce) and his wife (Thurman). The story revolves around alcoholism and whether or not it is a disease. As anyone with any acquaintance with this topic knows, this is often a matter of intense debate, and one that every alcoholic struggles with. As the story builds, there is some considerable suspense as the viewer is left guessing the motives of the characters, most notably Pryce. I thought the dialogue between Pryce and Considine was mostly quite excellent, and both turn in masterful performances. On the other hand, this is not Uma Thurman's best work but she is nice to look at so all is forgiven. There are a few excessively melodramatic moments and the ending struck me as a bit anticlimactic, but I personally found the film to be intriguing, and to use a tired cliche; thought-provoking. You see, the topic is something that is very personal to me and it literally made me rethink my position and look at it from a different angle. That being said, the conclusion is open-ended leaving the viewer to make up their own mind, and with something to contemplate. 3.5 stars.",3,And who wants to be cured of desire?,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,1251,"['short', 'HBO', 'film', 'based', 'play', 'David', 'Hare', 'somewhat', 'bizzare', 'story', 'alcoholic', 'poet', 'Considine', 'who', 'contact', 'powerful', 'businessman', 'Pryce', 'wife', 'Thurman', 'story', 'alcoholism', 'not', 'disease', 'anyone', 'acquaintance', 'topic', 'often', 'matter', 'intense', 'debate', 'one', 'alcoholic', 'story', 'builds', 'considerable', 'suspense', 'viewer', 'left', 'guessing', 'motives', 'characters', 'most', 'notably', 'Pryce', 'thought', 'dialogue', 'Pryce', 'Considine', 'was', 'mostly', 'quite', 'excellent', 'turn', 'masterful', 'performances', 'other', 'hand', 'not', 'Uma', 'Thurman', 'best', 'work', 'nice', 'look', 'so', 'forgiven', 'are', 'few', 'excessively', 'melodramatic', 'moments', 'ending', 'struck', 'bit', 'anticlimactic', 'personally', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'intriguing', 'use', 'tired', 'cliche', 'thought-provoking', 'see', 'topic', 'something', 'very', 'personal', 'literally', 'made', 'rethink', 'position', 'look', 'different', 'angle', 'being', 'said', 'conclusion', 'open-ended', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'something', 'contemplate', '3.5', 'stars']",My Zinc Bed

The main topic is alcoholism as John Pryce tells the alcoholic poet that AA is a cult. Then he goes and talks to Uma Thurman who has one of the most atrocious fake accents since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins.Then someone else talks and they talk and they talk and they talk. These are boring characters having boring philosophical discussions about alcoholism. This movie is less entertaining than hearing your just-out-of-rehab friend preach at you about your drinking.As Jonathan Pryce says in one scene - &#34;I don't want to bore you with what you already know.&#34; Sadly, he does.
