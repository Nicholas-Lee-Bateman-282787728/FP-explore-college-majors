1576084,A1QEWOSV05RYEO,B008SOSB0G,"Michael Brent Faulkner, Jr. ""Brent Faulkner""","[35, 38]","After purchasing Tyler Perry's last playTyler Perry's Aunt Bam's Place - The Play, I'll admit I was quite disappointed.  Tyler Perry has released many plays and films and while they all possess superbly inspiring and ultimately heartwarming messages, sometimes the plot can be narrow.  Aunt Bam's Place failed to have the 'oomph' that so many of Terry's plays do, even with its comedic relief; a lack of 'Madea' certainly hampered it.  'Madea' is absent in the newly releasedTyler Perry's I Don't Want to Do Wrong - The Play, but the plot is more unified than that of Aunt Bam's House.  Add the funny and popular Palmer Williams as well as Patrice Lovely, and the comical presence that lacked some in Aunt Bam's House is atoned for.The overall theme of I Don't Want to Do Wrong is adultery in a long distance marriage. The adultery comes to head and things become a complete mess which requires much prayer, patching up, and forgiveness.  As with the majority of Perry's plays, it ends happily, though if there were a quibble as to the realistic nature, the play could've ended oppositely and perhaps represented the more 'realist' view.  Other than an over-optimistic ending, the other rub might be the musical selections.  Sometimes the songs come off as flat (in general) in Perry's plays and are more annoying than inspirational as they are slated to be.  The songs tend to be 'big' ballads slated in soul/gospel sensibilities, but sometimes don't pack the punch until they are almost finished.Overall, I Don't Want To Do Wrong is one of Perry's better plays.  It avoids the missteps that disappointed in Aunt Bam's House, while coming close to rivaling non 'Madea' themed plays such asThe Marriage Counselor (The Play)orTyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married - The Play.
