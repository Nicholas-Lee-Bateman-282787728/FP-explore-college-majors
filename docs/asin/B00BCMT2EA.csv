There isn't  anything glamorous about it, it's kill or be killed by your'e enemy.  There were certainly acts of great bravery performed during WW11, but most of the actions were performed by ordinary frightened men, who were ordered to do a job.  These men suffered greatly during this conflict, many came totally changed, never to be the same men who left to fight the war.  THese films are important, because they show our history, be it good or bad.  I think it is important to preserve these films for future generations, so they understand this era in our history.  The authors did a fine job in putting this dvd together.  I would recommend it to students of WW11.

Most of the documentary is combat footage from the European and Pacific theaters of the war. It does an outstanding job of the intensity of combat and how the Allies were able to stop the evil empires of NAZI Germany and Imperial Japan and Facist Italy. With millions of casualties World War II was the biggest and most destructive war in history and after watching this DVD I can understand how intense it was over the six years it was fought.,5,The intensity and combat of World War II,1376352000,"08 13, 2013",2013,571,"['documentary', 'produced', 'National', 'Geographic', 'important', 'historical', 'events', 'World', 'War', 'II', '1939', '1945', 'Most', 'documentary', 'combat', 'footage', 'European', 'Pacific', 'theaters', 'war', 'outstanding', 'job', 'intensity', 'combat', 'how', 'Allies', 'were', 'able', 'stop', 'evil', 'empires', 'NAZI', 'Germany', 'Imperial', 'Japan', 'Facist', 'Italy', 'millions', 'casualties', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'was', 'biggest', 'most', 'destructive', 'war', 'history', 'watching', 'DVD', 'can', 'understand', 'how', 'intense', 'was', 'six', 'years', 'was', 'fought']",Inside World War Ii

1625562,A3QZ81L3DIO5C1,B00BCMT2EA,Michael L. Sweet,"[13, 14]","Just finished watching this show on NatGeo channel. What a great documentary. To me WWI in Color and this documentary are the two best videos on both wars. This is similar to WWI in Color in that it uses living veterans (many of whom are mentioned in Band of Brothers) to tell their story. I really like the way this film is organized. Easy to follow and the maps and explanations show how massive this war was. I have read many, many books on WWII and seen countless videos - this one ranks as one of the bests. It is long but too me, not long enough. Very touching, dramatic, surreal and horrible at the same time. I am putting this video on my wishlist hoping that one day I will get it for Father's Day, Christmas or any celebration (or if I can scrape up the bucks, which, by the way, is a really good price). All the major battle are covered but this film does not get bogged down with military strategy with hard-to-understand maps with arrows. There are some but they work with the film. There is a lot in this documentary that I have not seen or heard before. One interesting tidbit is that when Allied forces were in England it was an enlisted person who figured a way to attach a device on the front of a tank to plow through the hedgerows (they called it a rhino). Highly recommend this documentary.",5,WWII in a nutshell,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",2013,1311,"['Just', 'finished', 'watching', 'show', 'NatGeo', 'channel', 'What', 'great', 'documentary', 'WWI', 'Color', 'documentary', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'videos', 'wars', 'similar', 'WWI', 'Color', 'living', 'veterans', 'many', 'whom', 'are', 'mentioned', 'Band', 'Brothers', 'tell', 'story', 'really', 'way', 'film', 'organized', 'Easy', 'follow', 'maps', 'explanations', 'show', 'how', 'massive', 'war', 'was', 'have', 'read', 'many', 'many', 'books', 'WWII', 'seen', 'countless', 'videos', 'one', 'one', 'bests', 'long', 'too', 'not', 'long', 'enough', 'Very', 'touching', 'dramatic', 'surreal', 'horrible', 'same', 'time', 'am', 'putting', 'video', 'wishlist', 'hoping', 'one', 'day', 'will', 'get', 'Father', 'Day', 'Christmas', 'celebration', 'can', 'scrape', 'up', 'bucks', 'way', 'really', 'good', 'price', 'major', 'battle', 'are', 'covered', 'film', 'not', 'get', 'bogged', 'down', 'military', 'strategy', 'hard-to-understand', 'maps', 'arrows', 'are', 'work', 'film', 'lot', 'documentary', 'have', 'not', 'seen', 'heard', 'One', 'interesting', 'tidbit', 'when', 'Allied', 'forces', 'were', 'England', 'was', 'enlisted', 'person', 'who', 'figured', 'way', 'attach', 'device', 'front', 'tank', 'plow', 'hedgerows', 'called', 'rhino', 'recommend', 'documentary']",Inside World War Ii

I thought I knew quite a bit about World War II, but nothing to this extent. This program features the war from beginning to end in chronological order, following each battle as it happened, switching from the German front, to the Allied Forces, to the Japanese. I appreciated that because it really gave me a good idea of what really happened.The program is very graphic. I sometimes had to look away and some of the things they tell you (many veterans and survivors speak in this film) made me sick. However, it should make you sick, all of it. It should also make your proud of the soldiers who fought to win this war (and not just the USA, but all of the Allied Forces). I feel that if the USA had entered the war sooner, it would have ended sooner, but we'll never know.All the images and footage are real, no re-enactments. The veterans are brutally honest and often graphic. The pictures don't hide anything, literally. There is only a smart part on the Holocaust, which is fine, as there are many, many documentaries and books just on that subject alone. I have been to the Holocaust Museum in D.C. and I learned a lot there, so I knew going into this documentary what that was all about. However, for anyone just learning, I think a little more information could have been provided about the Holocaust. However, if you've been through Junior High, you've read Anne Frank's Diary and have a general idea of what that was all about.This doesn't include everything, I think it would take a lot longer than 3 hours to do so. However, if you have at least a basic knowledge of WWII history, it covers enough. It does not however cover the various smaller attacks on Australia, which surprised me. That was after all part of the war, why was it not included?Either way, I'll be adding this to my collection and hope to find more documentaries as good as this one to build upon all the information garnered from this documentary. I've seen many informative documentaries about Hitler and the Holocaust on NatGeo, so keep an eye out for them if you want something more centered just on Germany/Hitler or on the horrors of the Holocaust. There are also a lot of books on both subjects that go into great detail. This is a basic overall look at how the war played out.",5,"Graphic, Detailed, and Informative!",1371600000,"06 19, 2013",2013,2387,"['taped', 'NatGeo', 'watched', 'twice', 'Once', 'again', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'born', 'war', 'years', 'thought', 'knew', 'quite', 'bit', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'nothing', 'extent', 'program', 'war', 'beginning', 'end', 'chronological', 'order', 'following', 'battle', 'happened', 'switching', 'German', 'front', 'Allied', 'Forces', 'Japanese', 'appreciated', 'really', 'gave', 'good', 'idea', 'what', 'really', 'happened.The', 'program', 'very', 'graphic', 'sometimes', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'things', 'tell', 'many', 'veterans', 'survivors', 'speak', 'film', 'made', 'sick', 'However', 'should', 'make', 'sick', 'should', 'also', 'make', 'proud', 'soldiers', 'who', 'fought', 'win', 'war', 'not', 'just', 'USA', 'Allied', 'Forces', 'feel', 'USA', 'had', 'entered', 'war', 'sooner', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'sooner', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know.All', 'images', 'footage', 'are', 'real', 're-enactments', 'veterans', 'are', 'brutally', 'honest', 'often', 'graphic', 'pictures', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'anything', 'literally', 'only', 'smart', 'part', 'Holocaust', 'fine', 'are', 'many', 'many', 'documentaries', 'books', 'just', 'subject', 'alone', 'have', 'been', 'Holocaust', 'Museum', 'D.C.', 'learned', 'lot', 'there', 'knew', 'going', 'documentary', 'what', 'was', 'However', 'anyone', 'just', 'learning', 'think', 'little', 'more', 'information', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'provided', 'Holocaust', 'However', ""'ve"", 'been', 'Junior', 'High', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'Diary', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'about.This', ""n't"", 'include', 'everything', 'think', 'would', 'take', 'lot', 'longer', '3', 'hours', 'do', 'so', 'However', 'have', 'least', 'basic', 'knowledge', 'WWII', 'history', 'enough', 'not', 'however', 'cover', 'various', 'smaller', 'attacks', 'Australia', 'surprised', 'was', 'part', 'war', 'why', 'was', 'not', 'included', 'way', ""'ll"", 'be', 'adding', 'collection', 'hope', 'find', 'more', 'documentaries', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'build', 'information', 'garnered', 'documentary', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'informative', 'documentaries', 'Hitler', 'Holocaust', 'NatGeo', 'so', 'keep', 'eye', 'out', 'want', 'something', 'more', 'centered', 'just', 'Germany/Hitler', 'horrors', 'Holocaust', 'are', 'also', 'lot', 'books', 'subjects', 'go', 'great', 'detail', 'basic', 'overall', 'look', 'how', 'war', 'played', 'out']",Inside World War Ii
