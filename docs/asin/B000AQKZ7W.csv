931371,A3GKOMCQTTWPUI,B000AQKZ7W,"David Foskin ""SneakyGoblin on XBL""","[1, 1]","Tupac Amaru Shakur had many sides to him. There was the revolutionary that spoke on how powerful the streets would be if finally unified. He also was able to flip it to a much more poetic type who shined on ""Brenda's Got A Baby"" and ""Dear Momma."" What made him infamous though was his Thug Life persona. He was a rock star in his own brash and reckless way. In one of his last performances while on Death Row Records, Live At The House Blues (Death Row/Eagle Vision) captures Pac' in rare form in front of a Los Angeles crowd.Tupac gets the crowd buck with ""Ambitionz Az A Ridah."" The Outlawz back him up on stage as he sets the mood with the hard hitting album cut. Pac does smooth it out with the ""How Do You Want It."" K-Ci & Jo-Jo make a brief cameo to help out on the hook. The Deathrow Records atmosphere is further established when Snoop rocks while Pac takes a breather. The two close the show appropriately with ""2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted."" Even though Pac' only performs a handful of tracks, the quality is exceptional. This should hold down any Tupac fan until the next posthumous release.",4,Live at the House of Blues,1136246400,"01 3, 2006",2006,1100,"['Tupac', 'Amaru', 'Shakur', 'had', 'many', 'sides', 'was', 'revolutionary', 'spoke', 'how', 'powerful', 'streets', 'would', 'be', 'finally', 'unified', 'also', 'was', 'able', 'flip', 'much', 'more', 'poetic', 'type', 'who', 'shined', 'Brenda', 'Got', 'A', 'Baby', 'Dear', 'Momma', 'What', 'made', 'infamous', 'though', 'was', 'Thug', 'Life', 'persona', 'was', 'rock', 'star', 'own', 'brash', 'reckless', 'way', 'one', 'last', 'performances', 'Death', 'Row', 'Records', 'Live', 'House', 'Blues', 'Death', 'Row/Eagle', 'Vision', 'Pac', 'rare', 'form', 'front', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'crowd.Tupac', 'crowd', 'buck', 'Ambitionz', 'Az', 'A', 'Ridah', 'Outlawz', 'back', 'up', 'stage', 'mood', 'hard', 'hitting', 'album', 'cut', 'Pac', 'smooth', 'out', 'How', 'Do', 'Want', 'K-Ci', 'Jo-Jo', 'make', 'brief', 'cameo', 'help', 'out', 'hook', 'Deathrow', 'Records', 'further', 'established', 'when', 'Snoop', 'rocks', 'Pac', 'breather', 'two', 'close', 'show', 'appropriately', '2', 'Amerika', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'Even', 'Pac', 'only', 'handful', 'tracks', 'quality', 'exceptional', 'should', 'hold', 'down', 'Tupac', 'fan', 'next', 'posthumous', 'release']",N/A

931373,A2BEU7GPGNIG44,B000AQKZ7W,Dorrie Wheeler,"[12, 13]","Tupac Live At The House of Blues is now available in both DVD and CD format. Although the cover art for the CD and DVD are adorned with Tupac's image, the set really needs to pay more homage to Snoop Dogg and the Dogg Pound as they carry the bulk of the concert.The DVD opens up with a dark screen. Female voices can be heard talking about how fine and sexy Tupac is. Soon the concert begins. Tupac is rocking an all white outfit and he has a strong stage presence. The lighting is good for his performances and he is shown at several camera angles. This is a very good production, not some bootleg like concert. He rocks the stage with his partners The Outlawz. Tupac only performs a handful of songs, and some of the songs are cut short as Pac spits a few verses and launches into another song. He is joined by KC and JoJo from Jodeci for the song ""How Do You Want It."" Tupac offers some banter with the DJ as he goes back and forth about the track for ""How Do You Want It"" not being available. The DJ finds the track (whether this was a joke or a true situation isn't clear) and the trio pump ""How Do You Want It."" Pac does a lot of talking about Biggie A.K.A. ""Fat Boy,"" and the East Coast beef. Towards the end of the DVD he speaks about his alleged sexual romp with Faith Evans. Pac doesn't perform any of his pre-1995 hit songs. It's great to see Pac perform but his performance is so short it's almost like he was the opening act.The true stars of this DVD are Snoop Dogg, The Dogg Pound and Nate Dogg. Snoop opens up with ""Murder Was The Case."" They have quite a stage presence and really engage the audience. They rock a long set that includes all of their major hits. At the close of the show Tupac and Snoop perform their hit single ""2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted.""This is a really great concert DVD. The producers leave in all of the banter and talking and the audience feels like they are actually at the show. The DVD also includes five of Tupac's music videos from his double CD ""All Eyez On Me.""",5,Death Row's Finest Rock The House of Blues,1130803200,"11 1, 2005",2005,2008,"['Tupac', 'Live', 'House', 'Blues', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'CD', 'format', 'cover', 'art', 'CD', 'DVD', 'are', 'adorned', 'Tupac', 'image', 'set', 'really', 'pay', 'more', 'homage', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Dogg', 'Pound', 'carry', 'bulk', 'concert.The', 'DVD', 'up', 'dark', 'screen', 'Female', 'voices', 'can', 'be', 'heard', 'talking', 'how', 'fine', 'sexy', 'Tupac', 'Soon', 'concert', 'Tupac', 'rocking', 'white', 'outfit', 'strong', 'stage', 'presence', 'lighting', 'good', 'performances', 'shown', 'several', 'camera', 'angles', 'very', 'good', 'production', 'not', 'bootleg', 'concert', 'stage', 'partners', 'Outlawz', 'Tupac', 'only', 'handful', 'songs', 'songs', 'are', 'cut', 'short', 'Pac', 'few', 'verses', 'song', 'joined', 'KC', 'JoJo', 'Jodeci', 'song', 'How', 'Do', 'Want', 'Tupac', 'banter', 'DJ', 'back', 'forth', 'track', 'How', 'Do', 'Want', 'not', 'being', 'available', 'DJ', 'track', 'was', 'joke', 'true', 'situation', ""n't"", 'clear', 'trio', 'pump', 'How', 'Do', 'Want', 'Pac', 'lot', 'talking', 'Biggie', 'A.K.A', 'Fat', 'Boy', 'East', 'Coast', 'beef', 'end', 'DVD', 'alleged', 'sexual', 'romp', 'Faith', 'Evans', 'Pac', ""n't"", 'perform', 'pre-1995', 'hit', 'songs', 'great', 'see', 'Pac', 'perform', 'performance', 'so', 'short', 'almost', 'was', 'opening', 'act.The', 'true', 'stars', 'DVD', 'are', 'Snoop', 'Dogg', 'Dogg', 'Pound', 'Nate', 'Dogg', 'Snoop', 'up', 'Murder', 'Was', 'Case', 'have', 'quite', 'stage', 'presence', 'really', 'engage', 'audience', 'rock', 'long', 'set', 'major', 'hits', 'close', 'show', 'Tupac', 'Snoop', 'perform', 'hit', 'single', '2', 'Amerikaz', 'Most', 'Wanted', 'really', 'great', 'concert', 'DVD', 'producers', 'leave', 'banter', 'talking', 'audience', 'feels', 'are', 'actually', 'show', 'DVD', 'also', 'five', 'Tupac', 'music', 'videos', 'double', 'CD', 'Eyez', 'Me']",N/A

931378,AH6972QIUGL21,B000AQKZ7W,"ThePlayer ""theplayer26""","[3, 5]","First of all, this dvd should be titled Tupac and Snoop live in a club.  Pac and Snoops camera time is split about 50/50 so dont expect a concert of all Pac, and House of Blues is a small bar, not a concert hall. The quality is not dvd calibur by any strech of the imagination, although I can see this due to the fact it was recorded in 1996.  The audio is ok, not top notch, but again, I'm sure this was in no way meant to be released as a video.  In that regard, the editing is pretty bad and the camera angles aren't the best, one of the cameras is in the crowd where all the crowd has their hands up in the air and in the view, the sad part is that camera angle is used for a good 25% of the time.  Now don't get me wrong, I'm a huge pac fan (and snoop for that matter) so to me this concert was well worth the money spent, and in the history of music is a must have, just be warned that it is not professionally done, so don't expect it to be perfect.  And just so you know, there is very bad profanity throughout, so it's not something you'd want to buy your 9 year old for christmas.  In any event I'm not saying don't buy it, just know what you're getting.

Pac does a load of his classics, obviously mainly from his Death Row days like Ambitionz Az A Ridah, Hit Em Up, All About You and also a number of unreleased tracks (some you will recognise from posthumous albums).  I couldn't give this any less than 5 stars, Pac just brings the house down in his final recorded performance, I would like to hear less of The Outlawz though, while they don't ruin the performance, it would definetely sound better without their limited skills.It is a bit misleading to sell this as Tupac live, their is actually more of Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound, who perform most of the classics off Doggystyle and also tracks off Dogg Food.  Unlike the Outlawz, Kurupt and Daz are both great mc's and the live performances with Snoop are electric.All in all a great dvd, also featuring Nate Dogg & K-Ci and Jo Jo.
