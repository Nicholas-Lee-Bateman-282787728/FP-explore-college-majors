1202799,A17SZSI44O7NMV,B001I0P8CQ,S. Caros,"[9, 11]","I have had the pleasure of enjoying Paul's music and live performances for years. This is a good DVD, but not great. If you are looking to buy just one of his DVDs, I strongly suggest the first one ""Shalom Jerusalem"", it is the best of the bunch. (Jerusalem Arise is a close second).I grade this DVD down as it is more of a performance rather than worship. For example the Davdic dancing does not appear as ""unto the L-rd"" but rather for the audience. Paul has brought in some other performers who are repetitious and again are not particularly worshipful. His opening song ""Even so"" does not have the power it usually carries. I have seen him in person sing this, and he absolutely moves the audience. That doesn't quite happen here. Lastly, the camera work is very chaotic with constant switching back and forth and odd angles. It almost made me sea sick.Having said all of this, these are wonderful songs, but they are better and more true on Paul's CDs rather than here. Lastly, regarding the ""not Jewish"" comment, of course Paul is Jewish, as I am too. We are Messianic and we don't hide this fact. The reviewer made it seem like Paul tries to sneak that over on people and that is just not the case.",3,Not as good as first two,1292976000,"12 22, 2010",2010,1205,"['have', 'had', 'pleasure', 'enjoying', 'Paul', 'music', 'live', 'performances', 'years', 'good', 'DVD', 'not', 'great', 'are', 'looking', 'buy', 'just', 'one', 'DVDs', 'strongly', 'suggest', 'first', 'one', 'Shalom', 'Jerusalem', 'best', 'bunch', 'Jerusalem', 'Arise', 'close', 'second', '.I', 'grade', 'DVD', 'down', 'more', 'performance', 'rather', 'worship', 'example', 'Davdic', 'dancing', 'not', 'appear', 'L-rd', 'rather', 'audience', 'Paul', 'brought', 'other', 'performers', 'who', 'are', 'repetitious', 'again', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'worshipful', 'opening', 'song', 'Even', 'so', 'not', 'have', 'power', 'usually', 'have', 'seen', 'person', 'sing', 'absolutely', 'audience', ""n't"", 'quite', 'happen', 'here', 'Lastly', 'camera', 'work', 'very', 'chaotic', 'constant', 'switching', 'back', 'forth', 'odd', 'angles', 'almost', 'made', 'sea', 'sick.Having', 'said', 'are', 'wonderful', 'songs', 'are', 'better', 'more', 'true', 'Paul', 'CDs', 'rather', 'here', 'Lastly', 'regarding', 'not', 'Jewish', 'comment', 'course', 'Paul', 'Jewish', 'am', 'too', 'are', 'Messianic', 'do', ""n't"", 'hide', 'fact', 'reviewer', 'made', 'seem', 'Paul', 'tries', 'sneak', 'people', 'just', 'not', 'case']",N/A
