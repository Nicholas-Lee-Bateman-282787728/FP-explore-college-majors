1157702,A9K1DSRZ4RF1V,B0017PB5W4,"Allan Inouye ""a well wisher""","[7, 19]","This story begins promisingly with a young parapsychologist leaving her home in Salem, Oregon and driving to Arizona to investigate a supposedly haunted house.  She gets the scoop from a relative who briefly relates the story of the slain Mastersons. We already know about the killings because of an attention-grabbing opening sequence. The lady doc and three accomplices settle in for the spooky doings.  The other three ghost hunters are a TV cameraman with a bunch of equipment that seems to break down in key places, an ethnic newspaper woman from the town, and an apparently eccentric young woman who is having problems with her periods.With the introduction of the young woman, problems begin with the storyline.  She is supposedly an ardent Christian because she carries her Bible around and keeps saying that the Mastersons were good people and the ghost hunters are wretched vile heathens trying to tear their image apart.As the apparitions become more noticeable and the living characters become more irritable from lack of sleep, we learn through visions and accidental discoveries that the Masterson family was truly disturbed.  In a lengthy explanatory passage at the end, the ""whole story"" is brought out.  Whether you accept it or not depends on your reaction to the movie to this point.This movie plays as a combination of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and Casper the Friendly Ghost.  I did not get the creepy disembodied feeling that these other-worldly apparitions were truly harmful, although one of them has a problem with anger management.  We know pretty much what happened because of the opening sequence.  This leaves us focusing on the people in the present, and they are not a promising lot.The young woman parapsychologist follows the time honored pattern of the spiritual guru who has all the answers.  She sometimes sounds like the diminutive exorcist in Spielberg's ""Poltergeist.""  The TV cameraman smokes a lot and often says, ""You better come down and see this,"" and ""My battery just went dead."" He is the only male in an otherwise entirely female drama. He is much more interesting when he is looking through his camera than when the camera is on him. The ethnic news reporter is there for her filthy language and arguments with the young Christian zealot. The real problem, however, is this crazy young woman who is supposed to represent the church that the Mastersons attended.  She is vacuous, irritating and purposeless, but as the movie progresses, she steals center-stage from the ghost hunters.  Trouble is, there really isn't anything ""in"" this character except her lunatic-fringe Christian diatribes.It may be true in this politically correct world that ethnic minorities and the mentally and physically challenged are not proper objects of ridicule.  This seems to leave Christians as fair game.  In an adaptation of one of Stephen King's novels (The Fog), the chief antagonist is another Bible-spouting fanatic.  As we learn in the Masterson saga, the lord of the manor is a hypocritical sex-fiend, and his wife is a repressed, neurotic psycho who makes love with her head in a box.  However, these revelations, which should carry some conviction and drama, seem to be thrown in just to make the movie more lurid.  Yeah, yeah:  Christians are all a bunch of hypocrites.  (And they tend to agree and say, ""There's always room for one more!) So what?  Is this the purpose of the movie:  Christian bashing?  It's the old wacko, hypocritical, Bible-thumping, fire-and-brimstone caricature that's been around since the Pilgrims landed.Therefore, I believe that the central aspect of the movie, the damn-the-hypocritical Christians, is lame,easy, soft, cheesy, unconvincing, you name it.  It's always easier to stereotype people rather than create real, three-dimensional characters.  The movie takes an easy way out.We become involved with characters when we understand them and identify with them.  Caricatures are just that:  two dimensional targets which pander to people's prejudices.This house is supposedly one of the ten most haunted houses in America.  This movie is haunted by bad acting, poor character development, stereotyping and aimlessness.  The so-called explanation doesn't really explain anything.  And why isn't this key character wandering around the house?  She should feel right at home with the other crazy, two-dimensional fanatics.",1,one of the ten worst haunted movies in america,1215734400,"07 11, 2008",2008,4392,"['story', 'promisingly', 'young', 'parapsychologist', 'leaving', 'home', 'Salem', 'Oregon', 'driving', 'Arizona', 'investigate', 'supposedly', 'haunted', 'house', 'scoop', 'relative', 'who', 'briefly', 'story', 'slain', 'Mastersons', 'already', 'know', 'killings', 'attention-grabbing', 'opening', 'sequence', 'lady', 'doc', 'three', 'accomplices', 'settle', 'spooky', 'doings', 'other', 'three', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'are', 'TV', 'cameraman', 'bunch', 'equipment', 'break', 'down', 'key', 'places', 'ethnic', 'newspaper', 'woman', 'town', 'apparently', 'eccentric', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'having', 'problems', 'periods.With', 'introduction', 'young', 'woman', 'problems', 'begin', 'storyline', 'supposedly', 'ardent', 'Christian', 'Bible', 'around', 'saying', 'Mastersons', 'were', 'good', 'people', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'are', 'wretched', 'heathens', 'trying', 'tear', 'image', 'apparitions', 'become', 'more', 'noticeable', 'living', 'characters', 'become', 'more', 'irritable', 'lack', 'sleep', 'learn', 'visions', 'accidental', 'discoveries', 'Masterson', 'family', 'was', 'truly', 'disturbed', 'lengthy', 'explanatory', 'passage', 'end', 'whole', 'story', 'brought', 'out', 'accept', 'not', 'reaction', 'movie', 'point.This', 'movie', 'plays', 'combination', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Exorcist', 'Casper', 'Friendly', 'Ghost', 'did', 'not', 'get', 'creepy', 'disembodied', 'feeling', 'other-worldly', 'apparitions', 'were', 'truly', 'harmful', 'one', 'problem', 'management', 'know', 'pretty', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'opening', 'sequence', 'focusing', 'people', 'present', 'are', 'not', 'promising', 'lot.The', 'young', 'woman', 'parapsychologist', 'time', 'honored', 'pattern', 'spiritual', 'guru', 'who', 'answers', 'sometimes', 'diminutive', 'exorcist', 'Spielberg', 'Poltergeist', 'TV', 'cameraman', 'lot', 'often', 'better', 'come', 'down', 'see', 'battery', 'just', 'went', 'dead', 'only', 'male', 'otherwise', 'entirely', 'female', 'drama', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'when', 'looking', 'camera', 'when', 'camera', 'ethnic', 'news', 'reporter', 'there', 'filthy', 'language', 'arguments', 'young', 'Christian', 'zealot', 'real', 'problem', 'however', 'crazy', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'supposed', 'represent', 'church', 'Mastersons', 'attended', 'vacuous', 'irritating', 'purposeless', 'movie', 'center-stage', 'ghost', 'hunters', 'Trouble', 'really', ""n't"", 'anything', 'character', 'lunatic-fringe', 'Christian', 'diatribes.It', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'politically', 'correct', 'world', 'ethnic', 'minorities', 'mentally', 'physically', 'challenged', 'are', 'not', 'proper', 'objects', 'ridicule', 'leave', 'Christians', 'fair', 'game', 'adaptation', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novels', 'Fog', 'chief', 'antagonist', 'Bible-spouting', 'fanatic', 'learn', 'Masterson', 'saga', 'lord', 'manor', 'hypocritical', 'sex-fiend', 'wife', 'repressed', 'neurotic', 'psycho', 'who', 'love', 'head', 'box', 'However', 'revelations', 'should', 'carry', 'conviction', 'drama', 'seem', 'be', 'thrown', 'just', 'make', 'movie', 'more', 'lurid', 'Yeah', 'yeah', 'Christians', 'are', 'bunch', 'hypocrites', 'tend', 'agree', 'say', 'always', 'room', 'one', 'more', 'what', 'purpose', 'movie', 'Christian', 'bashing', 'old', 'wacko', 'hypocritical', 'Bible-thumping', 'fire-and-brimstone', 'caricature', 'been', 'Pilgrims', 'landed.Therefore', 'believe', 'central', 'aspect', 'movie', 'damn-the-hypocritical', 'Christians', 'lame', 'easy', 'soft', 'cheesy', 'unconvincing', 'name', 'always', 'easier', 'stereotype', 'people', 'rather', 'create', 'real', 'three-dimensional', 'characters', 'movie', 'easy', 'way', 'become', 'involved', 'characters', 'when', 'understand', 'identify', 'Caricatures', 'are', 'just', 'two', 'dimensional', 'targets', 'pander', 'people', 'prejudices.This', 'house', 'supposedly', 'one', 'ten', 'most', 'haunted', 'houses', 'America', 'movie', 'haunted', 'bad', 'acting', 'poor', 'character', 'development', 'stereotyping', 'aimlessness', 'so-called', 'explanation', ""n't"", 'really', 'explain', 'anything', 'why', ""n't"", 'key', 'character', 'wandering', 'house', 'should', 'feel', 'right', 'home', 'other', 'crazy', 'two-dimensional', 'fanatics']",Death Of A Ghost Hunter

1157706,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0017PB5W4,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[10, 13]","Creepy as hell.  Those are the ""three little words"" that every horror film aspires to achieve.  Very few succeed - especially in this horror fanatic's opinion - but Death of a Ghost Hunter earns this proclamation from my lips (and fingers).  It isn't a perfect film by any means, and some of my fellow horror enthusiasts have criticized it rather heavily, but this is the creepiest film I've seen since[Rec].  Not surprisingly, Death of a Ghost Hunter is a low-budget labor of love - I shudder to think just how badly Hollywood would have ruined it.  I actually see some of the movie's weaknesses, as pointed out by others, as strengths.  For instance, critics love to point out that the film was shot in a mere nine days, as if the secret of cinematic success is to spend a hundred million dollars over the course of nine months while pampering ""stars"" who might deign to come out of their trailers once or twice a day to actually shoot something.  Death of a Ghost Hunter is all about atmosphere, and I have to believe that such a tight shooting schedule helped cast and crew remain focused at all times on the task at hand and helped maintain that all-important atmosphere throughout.  This is a tight film - in terms of the production as well as the story itself - and I see that as a good thing.  Sure, the acting isn't top-notch in every scene, some of the dialogue could have benefited from some retooling, and the last part of the film is justifiably open for debate, but this film registers abnormally high on my creepiness meter, and a horror fan can hardly ask for more than that.The story is presented as a documentary account/recreation of ghost hunter Carter Simms' investigation of the Masterson house in Arizona - an investigation which, as we are told from the outset, resulted in Simms' death.  The house itself has been preserved almost untouched for the past twenty years, ever since the Masterson family (a minister, his wife, and their two children) were brutally murdered within its walls.  The house's current owner offers Simms five grand to investigate the goings-on there, and she is only too happy to oblige - even though it means working alongside a videographer and a newspaper reporter.  While Simms prefers to work alone, her new little trio works together fairly well.  The fourth member of this rag-tag team is a problem, though.  Mary Young Mortensen, a member of the church Mr. Masterson founded, is there to make sure the good name of the Mortensen family isn't besmirched.  It's a very fundamentalist church, and Mary herself is the worst kind of Christian - exceedingly judgmental and all too quick to condemn others.  Some Christian viewers may be offended by such a stereotypical portrayal of this Bible-thumper extraordinaire.  As a fundamentalist myself, I know she is in no way representative of my beliefs and practices, though, so it really doesn't bother me personally.  As far as the ghost hunting itself goes, truly dramatic things are observed and experienced the very first night, setting the stage for one intensive and eye-opening investigation that plays out in a way that Carter Simms could never have foreseen.Despite all of the bad reviews this film has gotten, I personally consider it one of the best haunting-based movies I've ever seen.  I say this as a pretty seasoned horror veteran who has been watching every horror film I can get my hands on for over a quarter of a century.  Yes, I will acknowledge the fact that this film has some flaws (particularly in the acting department), most of which are a direct result of the movie's low budget.  Given the resources at hand (according to my research, the film was made with a paltry budget of just ten thousand dollars), though, Death of a Ghost Hunter succeeds triumphantly.  The cinematography is amazing and the low-CGI special effects work exceedingly well.  The rapid-flash blending of past and present is presented much more effectively than what you will find in most large-budget horror films, and the ghostly manifestations presented throughout the course of the film include some of the creepiest shots I've ever seen.  That all speaks to one heck of a good directing job.  The early and late exposition scenes may run a tad long for some viewers, but everything in between is tightly shot by a director who really knows how to build tension, suspense, and atmosphere.  If this movie is any indication, it's just a matter of time before Sean Tretta is a household name among horror fans.  I know there are a lot of bad reviews of this film out there, but I would just ask you to give this film a chance.  It's one of the best low-budget horror films I've ever seen.",5,One of the creepiest haunting-based movies I've ever seen,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,4687,"['Creepy', 'hell', 'are', 'three', 'little', 'words', 'horror', 'film', 'aspires', 'achieve', 'Very', 'few', 'succeed', 'especially', 'horror', 'fanatic', 'opinion', 'Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'proclamation', 'lips', 'fingers', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'film', 'means', 'fellow', 'horror', 'enthusiasts', 'have', 'criticized', 'rather', 'heavily', 'creepiest', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', '[', 'Rec', ']', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'low-budget', 'labor', 'love', 'shudder', 'think', 'just', 'how', 'badly', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'have', 'ruined', 'actually', 'see', 'movie', 'weaknesses', 'pointed', 'out', 'others', 'strengths', 'instance', 'critics', 'love', 'point', 'out', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'mere', 'nine', 'days', 'secret', 'cinematic', 'success', 'spend', 'hundred', 'million', 'dollars', 'course', 'nine', 'months', 'pampering', 'stars', 'who', 'might', 'deign', 'come', 'trailers', 'once', 'twice', 'day', 'actually', 'shoot', 'something', 'Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'atmosphere', 'have', 'believe', 'tight', 'shooting', 'schedule', 'helped', 'cast', 'crew', 'remain', 'focused', 'times', 'task', 'hand', 'helped', 'maintain', 'all-important', 'atmosphere', 'tight', 'film', 'terms', 'production', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'see', 'good', 'thing', 'Sure', 'acting', ""n't"", 'top-notch', 'scene', 'dialogue', 'could', 'have', 'benefited', 'retooling', 'last', 'part', 'film', 'justifiably', 'open', 'debate', 'film', 'registers', 'abnormally', 'high', 'creepiness', 'meter', 'horror', 'fan', 'can', 'hardly', 'ask', 'more', 'that.The', 'story', 'presented', 'documentary', 'account/recreation', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'Carter', 'Simms', 'investigation', 'Masterson', 'house', 'Arizona', 'investigation', 'are', 'told', 'outset', 'resulted', 'Simms', 'death', 'house', 'been', 'preserved', 'almost', 'untouched', 'past', 'twenty', 'years', 'ever', 'Masterson', 'family', 'minister', 'wife', 'two', 'children', 'were', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'walls', 'house', 'current', 'owner', 'offers', 'Simms', 'five', 'grand', 'investigate', 'goings-on', 'there', 'only', 'too', 'happy', 'oblige', 'even', 'working', 'alongside', 'videographer', 'newspaper', 'reporter', 'Simms', 'prefers', 'work', 'alone', 'new', 'little', 'trio', 'together', 'fairly', 'well', 'fourth', 'member', 'rag-tag', 'team', 'problem', 'though', 'Mary', 'Young', 'Mortensen', 'member', 'church', 'Mr.', 'Masterson', 'founded', 'there', 'make', 'sure', 'good', 'name', 'Mortensen', 'family', ""n't"", 'besmirched', 'very', 'fundamentalist', 'church', 'Mary', 'worst', 'kind', 'Christian', 'exceedingly', 'judgmental', 'too', 'quick', 'condemn', 'others', 'Christian', 'viewers', 'may', 'be', 'offended', 'such', 'stereotypical', 'portrayal', 'Bible-thumper', 'extraordinaire', 'fundamentalist', 'know', 'way', 'representative', 'beliefs', 'practices', 'though', 'really', ""n't"", 'bother', 'personally', 'As', 'far', 'ghost', 'hunting', 'truly', 'dramatic', 'things', 'are', 'observed', 'experienced', 'very', 'first', 'night', 'setting', 'stage', 'one', 'intensive', 'eye-opening', 'investigation', 'out', 'way', 'Carter', 'Simms', 'could', 'never', 'have', 'foreseen.Despite', 'bad', 'film', 'gotten', 'personally', 'consider', 'one', 'best', 'haunting-based', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'say', 'pretty', 'seasoned', 'horror', 'veteran', 'who', 'been', 'watching', 'horror', 'film', 'can', 'get', 'hands', 'quarter', 'century', 'Yes', 'will', 'acknowledge', 'fact', 'film', 'flaws', 'particularly', 'acting', 'department', 'most', 'are', 'direct', 'result', 'movie', 'low', 'budget', 'Given', 'resources', 'hand', 'according', 'research', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'paltry', 'budget', 'just', 'ten', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'though', 'Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'triumphantly', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'low-CGI', 'special', 'effects', 'work', 'exceedingly', 'well', 'rapid-flash', 'blending', 'past', 'present', 'presented', 'much', 'more', 'effectively', 'what', 'will', 'find', 'most', 'large-budget', 'horror', 'films', 'ghostly', 'manifestations', 'presented', 'course', 'film', 'include', 'creepiest', 'shots', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'speaks', 'one', 'heck', 'good', 'directing', 'job', 'early', 'late', 'exposition', 'scenes', 'may', 'run', 'tad', 'long', 'viewers', 'everything', 'tightly', 'shot', 'director', 'who', 'really', 'how', 'build', 'tension', 'suspense', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'indication', 'just', 'matter', 'time', 'Sean', 'Tretta', 'household', 'name', 'horror', 'fans', 'know', 'are', 'lot', 'bad', 'reviews', 'film', 'there', 'would', 'just', 'ask', 'give', 'film', 'chance', 'one', 'best', 'low-budget', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen']",Death Of A Ghost Hunter

The acting itself wasn't necessarily bad, but for me the editing was too slow where the dialogue was involved.  If they had a different editor who knew how to cut it to make the dialogue go quicker and more naturally, I really believe this movie wouldn't have been that bad.  As it is, it has that film school graduate feel to it, kind of amateurish.  The actress playing Carter Simms was very good, I had no problem with her acting at all.

1157711,A769I5U3HK438,B0017PB5W4,Horror movie holic,"[1, 1]","When I rented this, I had pretty low expectations. Then after the first 10 minutes or so, I lowered them still. The up sides to this movie: good plot line with unexpected ending and some good creepy moments. The downsides: the acting is just awful. The lead that narrates at times is obviously reading as she speaks so it loses its sincerity. Though her performance did pick up as the movie went on. The supporting characters need some help. The woman playing the journalist couldn't be worse. During her ""dramatic"" moments, I could see her reciting them in front of the bathroom mirror and had no spontaneity and were completely disingenuous and thoroughly contrived. I suspect I won't be seeing her nominated for an oscar any time in the near future.In the end, I was rather surprised that I liked it as well as I did. It lacks a lot of special effects, but personally I think it adds to realism of a ghost story. One other complaint, and this is minor and easy enough to overcome, was the sets. It is supposed to take place in a house that hasn't been touched since about 1984 furnishings and all. No one but a cleaning lady has been inside in 25 years. But the structure, design and decor are all clearly much more modern than that making it difficult at times to get into for me since I tend to notice those kinds of little details. Obviously it was a budgetary problem, but there are enough houses out there lacking in updates that I think the director/producer could have done better.",3,I was surprised.,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,1491,"['When', 'rented', 'had', 'pretty', 'low', 'expectations', 'Then', 'first', '10', 'minutes', 'so', 'lowered', 'still', 'up', 'sides', 'movie', 'good', 'plot', 'line', 'unexpected', 'ending', 'good', 'creepy', 'moments', 'downsides', 'acting', 'just', 'awful', 'lead', 'times', 'obviously', 'reading', 'so', 'sincerity', 'performance', 'did', 'pick', 'up', 'movie', 'went', 'supporting', 'characters', 'need', 'help', 'woman', 'playing', 'journalist', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'worse', 'dramatic', 'moments', 'could', 'see', 'reciting', 'front', 'bathroom', 'mirror', 'had', 'spontaneity', 'were', 'completely', 'disingenuous', 'thoroughly', 'contrived', 'suspect', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'seeing', 'nominated', 'oscar', 'time', 'near', 'future.In', 'end', 'was', 'rather', 'surprised', 'liked', 'as', 'well', 'did', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'personally', 'think', 'realism', 'ghost', 'story', 'One', 'other', 'complaint', 'minor', 'easy', 'enough', 'overcome', 'was', 'sets', 'supposed', 'take', 'place', 'house', ""n't"", 'been', 'touched', '1984', 'furnishings', 'one', 'cleaning', 'lady', 'been', 'inside', '25', 'years', 'structure', 'design', 'decor', 'are', 'clearly', 'much', 'more', 'modern', 'making', 'difficult', 'times', 'get', 'tend', 'notice', 'kinds', 'little', 'details', 'was', 'budgetary', 'problem', 'are', 'enough', 'houses', 'there', 'lacking', 'updates', 'think', 'director/producer', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better']",Death Of A Ghost Hunter
1157712,A1LQLQUJJZUBTC,B0017PB5W4,Jeff  Farrow,"[1, 1]","The opening montage of GHOST HUNTER seemed like a dreadful repetition of PARANORMAL ENTITY: Handheld camera, scratchy film with forensic appearing pretensions, less than professional actors, very low budget, etc. Then after a couple minutes (this was even before the opening credits) the action in the montage took on a more horrific hue: Woman drowns baby with cross in a bathtub, then blows her brains out. I have a particular aversion to violence directed at children & animals, and remember thinking: This better be damn good...Then about 20 minutes into the actual story, I thought that what was unfolding was pretty interesting. Then I got sucked right into the plot & remained there until the bloody end, with even more horrific content than the first.The only thing that really bothered me was the unevenness of the sound. This seemed to amend itself after the first half of the move, still it's a close to fatal flaw.The acting was better than expected, but what really impressed me was the directing & script. True, the script is reminiscent of THE HAUNT, POLTERGEIST, etc, but it had originality all its own. For example, the spectral effects were well conceived. Nothing too over the top, many scenes were subtle & made the scary effect all that more affective. The full Monte effects of the ghosts were really good; sort of cubist conception with blending layers with a multidimensional dimensional appearance. 5 Stars for the ghosts!GHOST HUNTER indicates real talent & I hope the project has encouraged all involved to further creativity.This is all I want to say because I don't want to spoil the story.

1157723,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B0017PB5W4,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[1, 1]","Death of a Ghost Hunter (Sean Tretta, 2007)I really wanted to like Death of a Ghost Hunter, the first feature from Sean Tretta; the next year, he released The Death Factory Bloodletting, a slasher flick that never takes itself too seriously and ends up being a stupidly good time because of it. This movie, however, does not have that same attribute, while richly needing it; while it does have a few good-but-predictable twists, Tretta was still finding his cinematic feet here, and the end result is somewhat less than it should have been.Death of a Ghost Hunter is the story of Carter Simms (Machined's Patti Tindall), a paranormal investigator who's been hired to check out a house notorious for the mass murder of the family who lived there twenty years ago. When she and her cameraman Colin (Mike Marsh, who returned for The Death Factory Bloodletting) arrive, they discover an unpleasant surprise waiting for them in the form of Yvette (The Devil's Playhouse's Davina Joy), an investigative reporter who's as interested to get the full story on Carter Simms as she is to find out whether the house is haunted. As if that's not enough, a &#8220;spiritual advisor&#8221;, Mary (Lindsay Page in her only screen appearance to date), shows up later the first night to do some Bible-thumping. It's a motley crew indeed, almost as if the homeowner hand-picked these folks to play off one another. (You saw this more recently in Episode 50.) When creepy things start happening, the crew try to get to the bottom of what actually happened in the house and whether there are ghosts haunting it.There are some very interesting pieces to this plot (warning: the backstory of the house ends up containing a lot of triggering stuff), and Tretta, in his first collaboration with screenwriter Mike Marsh, had some good ideas about where to go. Both of those upsides were hamstrung by the obviously low budget they were working with and the caliber of some of the acting (there's a reason, one assumes, Page has only ever appeared in one movie). Given that Tretta has since shown himself capable of better when he's got even a slightly larger budget, it might be an interesting exercise for, say, Megan Ellison to toss fifty grand at him and see what a remake of this would look like with some professional actors (and a few better effects). What's here is heavy on potential, light on execution. **",2,"""I have sinned against you...""",1400457600,"05 19, 2014",2014,2389,"['Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'Sean', 'Tretta', '2007', 'really', 'wanted', 'Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'first', 'feature', 'Sean', 'Tretta', 'next', 'year', 'released', 'Death', 'Factory', 'Bloodletting', 'slasher', 'flick', 'never', 'too', 'seriously', 'up', 'being', 'stupidly', 'good', 'time', 'movie', 'however', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'attribute', 'richly', 'needing', 'have', 'few', 'good-but-predictable', 'twists', 'Tretta', 'was', 'still', 'finding', 'cinematic', 'feet', 'here', 'end', 'result', 'somewhat', 'less', 'should', 'have', 'been.Death', 'Ghost', 'Hunter', 'story', 'Carter', 'Simms', 'Machined', 'Patti', 'Tindall', 'paranormal', 'investigator', 'who', 'been', 'hired', 'check', 'out', 'house', 'notorious', 'mass', 'murder', 'family', 'who', 'lived', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'When', 'cameraman', 'Colin', 'Mike', 'Marsh', 'who', 'returned', 'Death', 'Factory', 'Bloodletting', 'arrive', 'discover', 'unpleasant', 'surprise', 'waiting', 'form', 'Yvette', 'Devil', 'Playhouse', 'Davina', 'Joy', 'investigative', 'reporter', 'who', 'as', 'interested', 'get', 'full', 'story', 'Carter', 'Simms', 'find', 'out', 'house', 'haunted', 'not', 'enough', '8220', 'spiritual', 'advisor', '8221', 'Mary', 'Lindsay', 'Page', 'only', 'screen', 'appearance', 'date', 'up', 'later', 'first', 'night', 'do', 'Bible-thumping', 'motley', 'crew', 'indeed', 'almost', 'homeowner', 'hand-picked', 'folks', 'play', 'off', 'one', 'saw', 'more', 'recently', 'Episode', '50', 'When', 'creepy', 'things', 'start', 'happening', 'crew', 'try', 'get', 'bottom', 'what', 'actually', 'happened', 'house', 'are', 'ghosts', 'haunting', 'are', 'very', 'interesting', 'pieces', 'plot', 'warning', 'backstory', 'house', 'up', 'containing', 'lot', 'triggering', 'stuff', 'Tretta', 'first', 'collaboration', 'screenwriter', 'Mike', 'Marsh', 'had', 'good', 'ideas', 'where', 'go', 'upsides', 'were', 'hamstrung', 'obviously', 'low', 'budget', 'were', 'working', 'caliber', 'acting', 'reason', 'one', 'assumes', 'Page', 'only', 'ever', 'appeared', 'one', 'movie', 'Given', 'Tretta', 'shown', 'capable', 'better', 'when', 'got', 'even', 'slightly', 'larger', 'budget', 'might', 'be', 'interesting', 'exercise', 'say', 'Megan', 'Ellison', 'toss', 'fifty', 'grand', 'see', 'what', 'remake', 'would', 'look', 'professional', 'actors', 'few', 'better', 'effects', 'What', 'here', 'heavy', 'potential', 'light', 'execution', '**']",Death Of A Ghost Hunter

1157727,AV6QDP8Q0ONK4,B0017PB5W4,"The Movie Guy ""Movies from A to Z""","[3, 3]","A team of four are investigating a haunted house. Carter (Patti Tindall) is a skeptical ghost hunter who leads the group. Her tools are a digital thermometer, EMF detector (great at detecting nuclear blasts), sound recorder, and irritating first person narration filled with creative 101 phrases such as ""ominous foreboding"" and ""retain the darkness."" Colin (Mike Marsh- writer, producer, and composer of said film) is the bald camera man who gives himself a ""7"" out of ""10"" or at least those are the words he wrote for reporter Yvette (Davina Joy, who remarkably still had a career after this film). The creepy Mary Young tags along as a representative of the church.The official story of the house is that someone killed the family, then mom coming home finding them dead, commits suicide in grief as per her note. We know that mom is the killer from the opening grainy film...but the ""why"" provides the twist.For those who like the ""Paranormal Activity"" series or someone who likes to see a skeptic put in their place, this film fits your needs. The acting left much to be desired. Patti Tindall read her lines horribly. The frequent close ups of her face didn't add anything to the film, but may be a clue as to the director's love interest. The music composed by Mike Marsh for the film was trite and cliche horror stuff, that should not have been used, leading me to believe the director swings both ways.The film had a good slow build up which held my interest, but at times the green night time camera became too much. Decent for a low budget production. I was not overly fond of the ""Paranormal"" series and would place it on par with them.F-bomb, brief weird sex, nudity (Lindsay Page, Sarah Lawton, April Hinojosa)",3,GHOSTS CAUSE AUNT FLO TO VISIT EARLY,1338768000,"06 4, 2012",2012,1724,"['team', 'four', 'are', 'investigating', 'haunted', 'house', 'Carter', 'Patti', 'Tindall', 'skeptical', 'ghost', 'hunter', 'who', 'group', 'tools', 'are', 'digital', 'thermometer', 'EMF', 'detector', 'great', 'detecting', 'nuclear', 'blasts', 'sound', 'recorder', 'irritating', 'first', 'person', 'narration', 'filled', 'creative', '101', 'phrases', 'such', 'ominous', 'foreboding', 'retain', 'darkness', 'Colin', 'Mike', 'Marsh-', 'writer', 'producer', 'composer', 'said', 'film', 'bald', 'camera', 'man', 'who', '7', '10', 'least', 'are', 'words', 'wrote', 'reporter', 'Yvette', 'Davina', 'Joy', 'who', 'remarkably', 'still', 'had', 'career', 'film', 'creepy', 'Mary', 'Young', 'along', 'representative', 'church.The', 'official', 'story', 'house', 'someone', 'killed', 'family', 'then', 'coming', 'home', 'finding', 'dead', 'commits', 'suicide', 'grief', 'note', 'know', 'mom', 'killer', 'opening', 'grainy', 'film', 'why', 'twist.For', 'who', 'like', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'series', 'someone', 'who', 'see', 'skeptic', 'put', 'place', 'film', 'needs', 'acting', 'left', 'much', 'be', 'desired', 'Patti', 'Tindall', 'read', 'lines', 'horribly', 'frequent', 'close', 'ups', 'face', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'clue', 'director', 'love', 'interest', 'music', 'composed', 'Mike', 'Marsh', 'film', 'was', 'trite', 'cliche', 'horror', 'stuff', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'used', 'leading', 'believe', 'director', 'swings', 'ways.The', 'film', 'had', 'good', 'slow', 'build', 'up', 'held', 'interest', 'times', 'green', 'night', 'time', 'camera', 'became', 'too', 'much', 'Decent', 'low', 'budget', 'production', 'was', 'not', 'overly', 'fond', 'Paranormal', 'series', 'would', 'place', 'par', 'them.F-bomb', 'brief', 'weird', 'sex', 'nudity', 'Lindsay', 'Page', 'Sarah', 'Lawton', 'April', 'Hinojosa']",Death Of A Ghost Hunter
