1034161,A3MV1KKHX51FYT,B000KHME7U,Acute Observer,"[1, 3]","The Formula, 1980 filmThe story begins in wartime, there is a bombing raid in Nazi Germany. A general will take secret documents in hope of a trade. But this truck is captured by the Americans. The war is over. Later a man is summoned by the police to investigate a murder. Lt. Caine sees the body of Neeley. There is a name written in blood! The chauffeur talks. Lt Caine talks to the widow, she doesn't say much. Neeley helped out the ruling class of Beverly Hills. Then he finds widow Neeley was also murdered by the same pistol! Caine visits an oil businessman to learn more. Caine develops a theory about the murders. When OPEC lowers output the price of gasoline goes up. Caine goes to Germany to investigate. America is fortunate to not have organized terrorists. A telephone call summons Caine to the Berlin Zoo to meet a man. Project Genesis created oil from coal. This is a threat to powerful interests, it is best to forget this technology.Outside a masked man shoots at Caine! His informant won't talk. The niece is questioned. What will she do next? Caine learns about a wartime alliance through shared patents with Americans. He continues his search at Club Venus. They meet the chief scientist who worked on Project Genesis, he tells his history and reveals the secret formula. Caine puts a letter in a safety-deposit box, and mails another. Caine learns more about Lisa, his companion. Lisa tells her story and warns Barney. They go to Berlin to meet Tedesco. ""Auf Wiedersehn."" There is a shocking surprise! Caine returns to Los Angeles. His partner was kidnapped. Caine visits Adam Stifel, the oil businessman to make a deal. He explains the politics behind the plot. A cartel seeks political harmony. Their main interest is in gathering wealth, which has costs. Oil is needed for America's existence. ""Enjoy the chocolates!"" Stifel makes a telephone call and a deal!This is a somewhat incredible story that fall short of average. Yes, coal can be turned into oil. You also need limestone, water, and cheap labor. Synthetic oil lacks the quality found in natural oil for some applications. [The details are out there.] The solution to America's need for oil requires a political solution, not some chemical formula. America was a net oil exporter before the mid-1960s. The political decision to disperse the population from cities and towns into the suburbs created a dependence on oil and gasoline. Oil companies benefitted greatly from this policy. The rise of supermarkets and shopping malls destroyed local small businesses that used to be within walking distance from most homes. Small farms are no longer close to small towns and cities.Just as there is no Philosopher's Stone to turn lead into gold there is no cheap solution to America's energy problems. Building office and industrial parks requires long drives on crowded highways and only makes the problems worse. It creates a national risk with any fuel shortage. The costs of highways was followed by general sales taxes in most states (NY in 1964, NJ in 1965). Post-1968 saw stagnant wages and rising taxes. Did such problems cause Rome to fall?",2,Another Conspiracy Story,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,3127,"['Formula', '1980', 'filmThe', 'story', 'wartime', 'bombing', 'raid', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'general', 'will', 'take', 'secret', 'documents', 'hope', 'trade', 'truck', 'captured', 'Americans', 'war', 'over', 'Later', 'man', 'summoned', 'police', 'investigate', 'murder', 'Lt.', 'Caine', 'body', 'Neeley', 'name', 'written', 'blood', 'chauffeur', 'talks', 'Lt', 'Caine', 'talks', 'widow', ""n't"", 'say', 'much', 'Neeley', 'helped', 'out', 'ruling', 'class', 'Beverly', 'Hills', 'Then', 'widow', 'Neeley', 'was', 'also', 'murdered', 'same', 'pistol', 'Caine', 'oil', 'businessman', 'learn', 'more', 'Caine', 'theory', 'murders', 'When', 'OPEC', 'output', 'price', 'gasoline', 'up', 'Caine', 'Germany', 'investigate', 'America', 'fortunate', 'not', 'have', 'organized', 'terrorists', 'telephone', 'call', 'summons', 'Caine', 'Berlin', 'Zoo', 'meet', 'man', 'Project', 'Genesis', 'created', 'oil', 'coal', 'threat', 'powerful', 'interests', 'best', 'forget', 'technology.Outside', 'masked', 'man', 'shoots', 'Caine', 'informant', 'wo', ""n't"", 'talk', 'niece', 'questioned', 'What', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'Caine', 'wartime', 'alliance', 'shared', 'patents', 'Americans', 'search', 'Club', 'Venus', 'meet', 'chief', 'scientist', 'who', 'worked', 'Project', 'Genesis', 'history', 'secret', 'formula', 'Caine', 'letter', 'safety-deposit', 'box', 'Caine', 'more', 'Lisa', 'companion', 'Lisa', 'story', 'Barney', 'go', 'Berlin', 'meet', 'Tedesco', 'Auf', 'Wiedersehn', 'shocking', 'surprise', 'Caine', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'partner', 'was', 'kidnapped', 'Caine', 'Adam', 'Stifel', 'oil', 'businessman', 'make', 'deal', 'politics', 'plot', 'cartel', 'political', 'harmony', 'main', 'interest', 'gathering', 'wealth', 'costs', 'Oil', 'needed', 'America', 'existence', 'Enjoy', 'chocolates', 'Stifel', 'telephone', 'call', 'deal', 'somewhat', 'incredible', 'story', 'fall', 'short', 'average', 'Yes', 'coal', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'oil', 'also', 'need', 'limestone', 'water', 'cheap', 'labor', 'Synthetic', 'oil', 'quality', 'found', 'natural', 'oil', 'applications', '[', 'details', 'are', 'there', ']', 'solution', 'America', 'need', 'oil', 'political', 'solution', 'not', 'chemical', 'formula', 'America', 'was', 'net', 'oil', 'exporter', 'mid-1960s', 'political', 'decision', 'disperse', 'population', 'cities', 'towns', 'suburbs', 'created', 'dependence', 'oil', 'gasoline', 'Oil', 'companies', 'benefitted', 'greatly', 'policy', 'rise', 'supermarkets', 'shopping', 'malls', 'destroyed', 'local', 'small', 'businesses', 'used', 'be', 'walking', 'distance', 'most', 'homes', 'Small', 'farms', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'close', 'small', 'towns', 'cities.Just', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'turn', 'lead', 'gold', 'cheap', 'solution', 'America', 'energy', 'problems', 'Building', 'office', 'industrial', 'parks', 'long', 'drives', 'crowded', 'highways', 'only', 'problems', 'worse', 'national', 'risk', 'fuel', 'shortage', 'costs', 'highways', 'was', 'followed', 'general', 'sales', 'taxes', 'most', 'states', 'NY', '1964', 'NJ', '1965', 'Post-1968', 'saw', 'stagnant', 'wages', 'rising', 'taxes', 'Did', 'such', 'problems', 'cause', 'Rome', 'fall']",Formula

The only way you can get THE FORMULA on DVD is either from this offering or with the Brando box set, which at this writing is less than $18 for five Brando movies. As a George C. Scott fan I decided to scoop this film up before it disappears. Some of Scott's more important films, such as THE FILM-FLAM MAN and THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS are not available on DVD except through the expensive secondary market.The premise of the movie is silly: at the center of the story, which takes place in the late 1970s, is a Nazi formula for making synthetic fuels from coal with no pollution that the oil industry wants to suppress, and will even commit multiple murders to do so. Scott is an LA detective investigating the murder of a friend, a former cop who now works for the oil company headed by Brando.  The investigation takes Scott from LA to Germany and Switzerland. As the bodies pile up, the investigation leads back to LA with the final confrontation between Scott and Brando. Scott realizes he has been been a pawn in a chess game under the control of Brando. Although, only in a few scenes, Brando gives a memorable performance as a bland but evil oil executive who likes Milk Duds and would rather be hiking in the Sierra Mountains, but his sense of patriotism and duty makes him do what he does. Scott, as always, is worth watching as the dedicated cop being manipulated by Brando, his boss and Marthe Keller, a member of a secret German radical group. If you like George C.

This is not a bomb, however, but a conspiracy film, although I didn't feel the conspiracy chosen was particularly stimulating as a subject. I imagine the creative staff bought it because they thought that the gasoline crises of the 70's, marked by the Arab Oil Embargo, would still be fresh in the  public mind. At any rate, Scott is a senior police officer on the LA force, assigned to discover the killer of a long time police officer. The hunt leads him to Germany (in 1980, there were still two Germanies) where he met the necessary beautiful woman. While there are a sufficiency of killings along the way, I would not call this one a thriller, since, while interesting, there is not much suspense or tension moving one along to the conclusion.For those of us who are of Scott's generation (he was 3 years older than Brando), it is a pleasure to watch him work before age, weight and life's experiences, took the edge off his presence.

It was sorta billed as a Marlon Brando movie, but it really was a George Scott movie and he did an excellent job. Brando was in the movie, especially toward the end, representing ""Big Oil"" and you'll probably end up loathing him. Nice job, Marlon.In World War 2, Germany did exceptionally well especially when you realize that they had little in the way of petroleum resources to propel their war machinery. How did they ever manage? Well, they had abundant coal resources and some of their scientists had discovered ways of turning coal into petroleum-like fuels. There was a secret formula and it required secret catalysts. These secrets escaped into Switzerland after the collapse of Germany but failed to again emerge. Well, a lot of people would like to see the secrets out and a lot of others wouldn't. The emergence could totally change the dynamics of the energy industries and some would benefit and some would lose. As one line in the movie put it, it wasn't so much the oil business, but the oil shortage business that was driving the wealth.The movie begins with a mysterious murder and Scott gets called in to investigate. Shortly thereafter, there's another related murder. The murders seem to indicate a connection to Berlin and Scott is off to a nice German vacation/adventure where he is advised to keep his nose out of German business. Well, you know that's not going to happen or we wouldn't have much of a movie. Scott gets involved. Toward the end he returns to the US and Brando re-enters the picture as a representative of ""Big Oil.""

The times also saw the rise of a multitude of conspiracy theories, both political and economic.  If the Trilateral Commission rings a bell, then you may be familiar with the kind of distrust of business and government that some felt.  Big oil was also subject to scrutiny, as huge profits were made in the industry.Out of this unrest and distrust comes The Formula (1980), a film that is mostly concerned with a conspiracy by players in the energy industry, to maximize profitability.  The feeling of paranoia is strong, as a series of murders leads to a LA police being sent to Germany to find information about a mysterious formula related to the manufacture of synthetic fuel.  Competently directed by John G. Avildsen (Rocky, The Karate Kid), the movie remarkably features the first two actors to refuse their Best Actor Oscar, George C. Scott, and Marlon Brando.  Steve Shagan who wrote the original story, also penned the screenplay, and serves as executive producer.The story begins at the close of World War II, where German General Helmut Kladen (Richard Lynch) entrusted with valuable secrets of the Reich, is captured by American soldiers led by Major Thomas Neely.  Jumping forward to the present, LA police detective Lt. Barney Caine (Scott) is called in to investigate the murder of his old friend, former police chief Tom Neely.  The investigation leads to Caine questioning Adam Steiffel (Brando), a big wheel in the international energy biz.  Steiffel reveals that he employed Neely as a courier, delivering bribe money to his overseas contacts in Europe.  Caine discovers information that Neely's death may be related to his activities in while in Germany during the war, he convinces his superior (in an extended continuous shot) to allow him go to Berlin to try and solve the case.The movie enters a whole new phase, as Caine arrives in Berlin, and enters a swirling world of intrigue.  Caine engages in some very solid detective work in an atmospheric winter setting, but almost everyone that he speaks with, is murdered soon after.  Caine forms an association with Lisa Spangler (Marthe Keller), the niece of a one of the victims.  Under a lot of stress, Caine is slightly off his game, but he's a damn good detective and eventually uncovers the truth.  Returning home, things unravel a bit, as the remaining answers are revealed.The scenes between Brando and Scott are notable, as these two screen giants interact mostly one on one.  In their last meeting, Adam Steiffel is supremely confident and has little fear of speaking his mind.  He's a master player, with the world as his chessboard, who with a long term perspective, makes whatever moves are necessary to advance his interests.  Realizing his vulnerability, Cain refrains from getting violent, as the film winds down to a cynical, business as usual finish.  This final confrontation is a little pompous and surreal, but it's something that the film seemingly builds up to.Director John G. Avildsen, and screenwriter and executive producer Steve Shagan, provide a commentary track which is kind of spotty and little light on technical details.  The men seem to be old friends, and their conversation contains a lot of inside jokes, and anecdotes about cast members, particularly Brando.  Often they seem to be having a private conversation, rather oblivious of any audience.  One interesting revelation is that Shagan wanted Gene Hackman to play Caine, rather than George C. Scott.  Both men seem less than enthusiastic regarding Scott, though the reasons are not specifically stated.The Formula is well put together, features some good cinematography, and is nicely paced, as a methodical Caine manages to gather together the pieces of the puzzle.  Although distracted by a little romance, the detective gets the job done in a mostly realistic manner.  The sudden and violent murders that occur in Germany, add a little edge to a drama that is a little sparse in the action department.  The plot does include many realistic elements, as the Nazi war machine actually did depend to a large degree, on fuel synthesized from coal.  The desire to utilize Russian oil fields was a factor in Hitler's decision to attack Russia, and the Allies utilized German scientists after the war.  Then as now, the motives of big oil are suspect, and the subject of speculation by some, as energy concerns continue to be a major factor in the economic and political lives of most Americans.",4,"big oil flexes some muscle, in this solid conspiracy based thriller...",1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,4588,"['mid', '70', 'were', 'turbulent', 'times', 'rampant', 'inflation', 'rising', 'terrorism', 'energy', 'crunch', 'saw', 'OPEC', 'assume', 'great', 'power', 'times', 'also', 'saw', 'rise', 'multitude', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'political', 'economic', 'Trilateral', 'Commission', 'bell', 'then', 'may', 'be', 'familiar', 'kind', 'distrust', 'business', 'government', 'felt', 'Big', 'oil', 'was', 'also', 'subject', 'scrutiny', 'huge', 'profits', 'were', 'made', 'industry.Out', 'unrest', 'distrust', 'Formula', '1980', 'film', 'mostly', 'concerned', 'conspiracy', 'players', 'energy', 'industry', 'maximize', 'profitability', 'feeling', 'paranoia', 'strong', 'series', 'murders', 'leads', 'LA', 'police', 'being', 'sent', 'Germany', 'find', 'information', 'mysterious', 'formula', 'related', 'manufacture', 'synthetic', 'fuel', 'Competently', 'directed', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'Rocky', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'movie', 'remarkably', 'first', 'two', 'actors', 'refuse', 'Best', 'Actor', 'Oscar', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'Steve', 'Shagan', 'who', 'wrote', 'original', 'story', 'also', 'penned', 'screenplay', 'serves', 'executive', 'producer.The', 'story', 'close', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'where', 'German', 'General', 'Helmut', 'Kladen', 'Richard', 'Lynch', 'entrusted', 'valuable', 'secrets', 'Reich', 'captured', 'American', 'soldiers', 'led', 'Major', 'Thomas', 'Neely', 'Jumping', 'forward', 'present', 'LA', 'police', 'detective', 'Lt.', 'Barney', 'Caine', 'Scott', 'called', 'investigate', 'murder', 'old', 'friend', 'former', 'police', 'chief', 'Tom', 'Neely', 'investigation', 'Caine', 'questioning', 'Adam', 'Steiffel', 'Brando', 'big', 'wheel', 'international', 'energy', 'biz', 'Steiffel', 'employed', 'Neely', 'courier', 'delivering', 'bribe', 'money', 'overseas', 'contacts', 'Europe', 'Caine', 'information', 'Neely', 'death', 'may', 'be', 'related', 'activities', 'while', 'Germany', 'war', 'superior', 'extended', 'continuous', 'shot', 'allow', 'go', 'Berlin', 'try', 'solve', 'case.The', 'movie', 'whole', 'new', 'phase', 'Caine', 'Berlin', 'swirling', 'world', 'intrigue', 'Caine', 'very', 'solid', 'detective', 'work', 'atmospheric', 'winter', 'setting', 'almost', 'everyone', 'murdered', 'soon', 'Caine', 'association', 'Lisa', 'Spangler', 'Marthe', 'Keller', 'niece', 'one', 'victims', 'lot', 'stress', 'Caine', 'slightly', 'game', 'damn', 'good', 'detective', 'eventually', 'truth', 'Returning', 'home', 'things', 'unravel', 'bit', 'remaining', 'answers', 'are', 'revealed.The', 'scenes', 'Brando', 'Scott', 'are', 'notable', 'two', 'screen', 'giants', 'interact', 'mostly', 'one', 'one', 'last', 'meeting', 'Adam', 'Steiffel', 'supremely', 'confident', 'little', 'fear', 'speaking', 'mind', 'master', 'player', 'world', 'chessboard', 'who', 'long', 'term', 'perspective', 'moves', 'are', 'necessary', 'advance', 'interests', 'Realizing', 'vulnerability', 'Cain', 'getting', 'violent', 'film', 'down', 'cynical', 'business', 'usual', 'finish', 'final', 'confrontation', 'little', 'pompous', 'surreal', 'something', 'film', 'seemingly', 'up', 'to.Director', 'John', 'G.', 'Avildsen', 'screenwriter', 'executive', 'producer', 'Steve', 'Shagan', 'provide', 'commentary', 'track', 'kind', 'spotty', 'little', 'light', 'technical', 'details', 'men', 'seem', 'be', 'old', 'friends', 'conversation', 'lot', 'inside', 'jokes', 'cast', 'members', 'particularly', 'Brando', 'Often', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'private', 'conversation', 'rather', 'oblivious', 'audience', 'One', 'interesting', 'revelation', 'Shagan', 'wanted', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'play', 'Caine', 'rather', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'men', 'seem', 'less', 'enthusiastic', 'regarding', 'Scott', 'reasons', 'are', 'not', 'specifically', 'stated.The', 'Formula', 'well', 'put', 'together', 'good', 'cinematography', 'nicely', 'paced', 'methodical', 'Caine', 'gather', 'together', 'pieces', 'puzzle', 'distracted', 'little', 'romance', 'detective', 'job', 'done', 'mostly', 'realistic', 'manner', 'sudden', 'violent', 'murders', 'occur', 'Germany', 'add', 'little', 'edge', 'drama', 'little', 'sparse', 'action', 'department', 'plot', 'include', 'many', 'realistic', 'elements', 'Nazi', 'war', 'machine', 'actually', 'did', 'depend', 'large', 'degree', 'fuel', 'synthesized', 'coal', 'desire', 'utilize', 'Russian', 'oil', 'fields', 'was', 'factor', 'Hitler', 'decision', 'attack', 'Russia', 'Allies', 'utilized', 'German', 'scientists', 'war', 'Then', 'now', 'motives', 'big', 'oil', 'are', 'suspect', 'subject', 'speculation', 'energy', 'concerns', 'continue', 'be', 'major', 'factor', 'economic', 'political', 'lives', 'most', 'Americans']",Formula

It's one of those lethargic thrillers where cardboard characters constantly talk to each other about things that happened offscreen and which the film would have been far better showing us as George C. Scott's LA cop uncovers a conspiracy involving a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that Marlon Brando's eccentric oilman wants kept under lock and key so he can artificially inflate the price of oil. The teaming of Oscar's two most famous refusniks sadly provides no sparks - indeed, there was reportedly more drama offscreen at the time between director John G. Avildsen and writer/producer Steve Shagan over the re-editing of the film, so it's a genuine surprise to find them jovially sharing the audio commentary on Warners' new DVD. Not that it seems that anyone else was so passionate about the film: there's no shortage of class talent here (John Gielgud and Beatrice Straight also turn up), but it's clear that the paycheck is of more interest to them than the script and they're just slumming it.

Scott) who investigates the murder of his friend, a retired cop, which leads to Germany and a Nazi formula for synthetic fuel that big oil naturally wants to suppress at all costs. Marlon Brando plays a shady oil tycoon but only appears for roughly 15 minutes of the almost 2-hour runtime.The film is top-of-the-line as far as cast, location and cinematography go. It starts off like aDirty Harry Collection (Dirty Harry / Magnum Force / The Enforcer / Sudden Impact / The Dead Pool)flick substituting Scott for Eastwood with his Asian sidekick, but the plot's too complicated and there's not enough action for Dirty Harry fans. The rest of the film seems like an episode ofColumbo: The Complete Seriesmixed with Scott's ""Hardcore"" where he goes undercover in Southern California investigating his daughter's disappearance.The highlights include the WWII and Nazi elements, acting giants Scott and Brando, the lovely Marthe Keller, the rest of the cast, the great locations (California, Germany and Switzerland) and the emphasis on dialogue above thrills, which may be a detriment to others. Regarding the Nazi elements, there's a brief strip club scene where Nazi imagery is used as a backdrop for the dancers, fittingly showing how yesterday's unspeakable horrors are forgotten by the next generation and utilized for entertainment or recreation.Brando has proved time and again that he has a knack for playing weird, quirky characters (""The Missouri Breaks"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Godfather"" and ""The Island of Dr. Moreau (Unrated Director's Cut)"") and he tries to do it here with his portrayal of an oil executive, but with so-so results. I didn't buy it; it comes off as more of a performance rather than a real person. Still, you've gotta give him credit for trying and Brando is always entertaining, even when he fumbles.The main problem here is the convoluted plot. There are so many names it's hard to keep up (I recommend using the subtitles as it helps keep track). The conclusion is both thought-provoking and unsatisfactory; a strange mix.So ""The Formula"" is a mixed bag, but its strengths outweigh it's weaknesses, but not by much. It's worthwhile if you're a fan of the stars and if you're in the mood for a thought-provoking and globetrotting crime/thiller that's heavy on talk and light on thrills.GRADE: B-",4,"Odd, but worthwhile",1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2013,2431,"['Released', '1980', 'Formula', 'star-studded', 'crime/thriller', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'detective', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'who', 'murder', 'friend', 'retired', 'cop', 'Germany', 'Nazi', 'formula', 'synthetic', 'fuel', 'big', 'oil', 'naturally', 'suppress', 'costs', 'Marlon', 'Brando', 'shady', 'oil', 'tycoon', 'only', 'roughly', '15', 'minutes', 'almost', '2-hour', 'runtime.The', 'film', 'top-of-the-line', 'as', 'far', 'cast', 'location', 'cinematography', 'go', 'aDirty', 'Harry', 'Collection', 'Dirty', 'Harry', '/', 'Magnum', 'Force', '/', 'Enforcer', '/', 'Sudden', 'Impact', 'Dead', 'Pool', 'flick', 'substituting', 'Scott', 'Eastwood', 'Asian', 'sidekick', 'plot', 'too', 'complicated', 'not', 'enough', 'action', 'Dirty', 'Harry', 'fans', 'rest', 'film', 'episode', 'ofColumbo', 'Complete', 'Seriesmixed', 'Scott', 'Hardcore', 'where', 'undercover', 'Southern', 'California', 'investigating', 'daughter', 'disappearance.The', 'highlights', 'include', 'WWII', 'Nazi', 'elements', 'acting', 'giants', 'Scott', 'Brando', 'lovely', 'Marthe', 'Keller', 'rest', 'cast', 'great', 'locations', 'California', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'emphasis', 'dialogue', 'thrills', 'may', 'be', 'detriment', 'others', 'Regarding', 'Nazi', 'elements', 'brief', 'strip', 'club', 'scene', 'where', 'Nazi', 'imagery', 'used', 'backdrop', 'dancers', 'fittingly', 'showing', 'how', 'yesterday', 'unspeakable', 'horrors', 'are', 'forgotten', 'next', 'generation', 'utilized', 'entertainment', 'recreation.Brando', 'proved', 'time', 'again', 'knack', 'playing', 'weird', 'quirky', 'characters', 'Missouri', 'Breaks', 'Apocalypse', 'Now', 'Godfather', 'Island', 'Dr.', 'Moreau', 'Unrated', 'Director', 'Cut', 'do', 'here', 'portrayal', 'oil', 'executive', 'so-so', 'results', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'off', 'more', 'performance', 'rather', 'real', 'person', 'Still', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'give', 'credit', 'trying', 'Brando', 'always', 'entertaining', 'even', 'when', 'fumbles.The', 'main', 'problem', 'here', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'names', 'hard', 'keep', 'up', 'recommend', 'using', 'subtitles', 'keep', 'track', 'conclusion', 'thought-provoking', 'unsatisfactory', 'strange', 'mix.So', 'Formula', 'mixed', 'bag', 'strengths', 'outweigh', 'weaknesses', 'not', 'much', 'worthwhile', ""'re"", 'fan', 'stars', ""'re"", 'mood', 'thought-provoking', 'globetrotting', 'crime/thiller', 'heavy', 'talk', 'light', 'thrills.GRADE', 'B-']",Formula
