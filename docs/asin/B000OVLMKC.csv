You have episodes that don't have the always corny ""happy ending"". I like that! I like a show where the good guys dont always win.Few complaints, Don Johnson took half the season off, many episodes you only see him in the opening scene and thats it, totally gone from then on, many of the episodes feature Rico and Stan more than Rico and Sonny.  But it still works out great, Tubbs gets more of the starring role.Season 5 features the cult classic episode ""Miracle Man"", the silliest episode ever but it still works and it's funny to see them act all serious about Miracle Man, you gotta buy the DVD set for that episode alone!Great scripts and stories, not sure why Season 5 failed so bad in the ratings other than to think that after 5 years, the teenie boppers of the MTV generation graduated High School and moved on and the new younger crowd fed on other shows at the time instead like Full House and crap like that.

Totally absent was directorial, musical, or writer innovation.  Don Jonson looked like he was on chemotherapy or some juiced member of a biker gang.  The stories were loud and largely ripped from other (BAD) popular series of the time.  Like the magical ray gun.  Or rogue cops.  The Gambler's Anonymous episode.  Or a Holocaust episode (in the Season of Holocaust Specials, three a year at least by the late 80s).  Etc.It reminds one of the sloppy writing in the latter years of MASH.  Where we become sooooo concerned about the feelings of Houlahan and the clerk, whatshisname, Klinger, and the rest of the ""gang"".  Whatever.Bad bad bad.

1066414,A2XMBWQL0LGNJD,B000OVLMKC,Dave Cordes,"[82, 86]","After five trendsetting seasons of defining the cultural 80's vibe, Vice was beginning to lose its glamour and had overstayed its welcome by becoming as trendy and outmoded as yesterday's pastel-colored fashions.  The mood and feel of the show had shifted away from the pop-electric neon atmosphere of earlier seasons to a darker and edgier tone beginning with the two-part conclusion to the season four cliffhanger ""Mirror Image"" that ended with Sonny, believing that he is his undercover persona Burnett after suffering total amnesia in a boat explosion, races off in a speedboat after killing an undercover detective.  Tubbs has tracked him down somewhere near Ft. Lauderdale where he has been living for months as a hit-man for a powerful crime cartel.  The premiere episode ""Hostile Takeover"" begins with Sonny rising through the ranks of the Carrera's by doing the dirty deeds for the feuding family in an effort to take out the rival El Gato organization.  Posing as a Jamaican buyer, Tubbs rendezvous with Sonny at the Cape Florida Lighthouse in an effort to jar his memory but instead Sonny tries to kill Tubbs when it triggers a memory flashback and he remembers that he is a cop.After the initial Burnett story-arc is concluded in ""Redemption in Blood,"" the remaining episodes seemed to turn somewhat anti-climactic.  What could have been an interesting season-long theme that that could have potentially played up Sonny-turned-bad masquerading as his undercover alter-ego Burnett is cut short prematurely and it's hard to believe that Sonny isn't indicted for all of his heinous crimes or at the very least is forced to turn in his badge.  There's a few moments with Crockett trying to reconcile his relationship with his son Billy in ""To Have and To Hold"" and coming to terms with his ex, Caroline, and an amusing light-hearted episode with his con-artist cousin Jack played by David Andrews in ""Jack of All Trades"" and also Tubbs reuniting with Valerie reprised by Pam Grier in the originally unaired ""Too Much, Too Late"" that help to wrap up loose ends but overall you can sense that the end of the line was coming and the cast and crew were just riding things out.  Don Johnson's wardrobe had gone from stylish slacks and casual loafers to denim bluejeans and cowboy boots and his long shaggy blonde locks made him look like he'd just walked off the set of Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man.  The absence of composer Jan Hammer is painfully felt and Tim Truman's commendable scoring gives it a very different overall feel compared to previous seasons and redundant plotlines involving South American drug smugglers had finally exhausted themselves but the payoff at the end of the final episode ""Freefall"" is emotional as the ensemble cast members say their goodbyes and go their seperate ways and almost as suddenly as Miami Vice had come to an end, so too had the fashionable decade of the 1980's.",4,The end of the 80's and the decade of Vice,1176508800,"04 14, 2007",2007,2918,"['five', 'trendsetting', 'seasons', 'defining', 'cultural', '80', 'vibe', 'Vice', 'was', 'beginning', 'lose', 'glamour', 'had', 'overstayed', 'welcome', 'becoming', 'trendy', 'outmoded', 'yesterday', 'pastel-colored', 'fashions', 'mood', 'feel', 'show', 'had', 'shifted', 'away', 'pop-electric', 'neon', 'atmosphere', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'darker', 'edgier', 'tone', 'beginning', 'two-part', 'conclusion', 'season', 'four', 'cliffhanger', 'Mirror', 'Image', 'ended', 'Sonny', 'believing', 'undercover', 'persona', 'Burnett', 'suffering', 'total', 'amnesia', 'boat', 'explosion', 'off', 'speedboat', 'killing', 'undercover', 'detective', 'Tubbs', 'tracked', 'down', 'somewhere', 'Ft.', 'Lauderdale', 'where', 'been', 'living', 'months', 'hit-man', 'powerful', 'crime', 'cartel', 'premiere', 'episode', 'Hostile', 'Takeover', 'Sonny', 'rising', 'ranks', 'Carrera', 'doing', 'dirty', 'deeds', 'feuding', 'family', 'effort', 'take', 'out', 'rival', 'El', 'Gato', 'organization', 'Posing', 'Jamaican', 'buyer', 'Tubbs', 'Sonny', 'Cape', 'Florida', 'Lighthouse', 'effort', 'jar', 'memory', 'instead', 'Sonny', 'tries', 'kill', 'Tubbs', 'when', 'memory', 'flashback', 'cop.After', 'initial', 'Burnett', 'story-arc', 'concluded', 'Redemption', 'Blood', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'seemed', 'turn', 'somewhat', 'anti-climactic', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'season-long', 'theme', 'could', 'have', 'potentially', 'played', 'up', 'Sonny-turned-bad', 'masquerading', 'undercover', 'alter-ego', 'Burnett', 'cut', 'short', 'prematurely', 'hard', 'believe', 'Sonny', ""n't"", 'indicted', 'heinous', 'crimes', 'very', 'least', 'forced', 'turn', 'badge', 'few', 'moments', 'Crockett', 'trying', 'reconcile', 'relationship', 'son', 'Billy', 'Have', 'Hold', 'coming', 'terms', 'ex', 'Caroline', 'amusing', 'light-hearted', 'episode', 'con-artist', 'cousin', 'Jack', 'played', 'David', 'Andrews', 'Jack', 'All', 'Trades', 'also', 'Tubbs', 'reuniting', 'Valerie', 'reprised', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'originally', 'unaired', 'Too', 'Much', 'Too', 'Late', 'help', 'wrap', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'overall', 'can', 'sense', 'end', 'line', 'was', 'coming', 'cast', 'crew', 'were', 'just', 'riding', 'things', 'out', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'wardrobe', 'had', 'gone', 'stylish', 'slacks', 'casual', 'loafers', 'denim', 'bluejeans', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'long', 'shaggy', 'blonde', 'locks', 'made', 'look', ""'d"", 'just', 'walked', 'off', 'set', 'Harley', 'Davidson', 'Marlboro', 'Man', 'absence', 'composer', 'Jan', 'Hammer', 'painfully', 'felt', 'Tim', 'Truman', 'commendable', 'scoring', 'very', 'different', 'overall', 'feel', 'compared', 'previous', 'seasons', 'redundant', 'plotlines', 'involving', 'South', 'American', 'drug', 'smugglers', 'had', 'finally', 'exhausted', 'payoff', 'end', 'final', 'episode', 'Freefall', 'emotional', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'members', 'say', 'goodbyes', 'go', 'seperate', 'ways', 'almost', 'as', 'suddenly', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'had', 'come', 'end', 'so', 'too', 'had', 'fashionable', 'decade', '1980']",Miami Vice: Season Five

It is ridiculous to see that so many ""critics"" still to this day dismiss the groundbreaking content that this series delivered long after the early ""hot"" pastel phase of the series gave way to darker, far more serious, far more sophisticated, scary and politically prescient fare. This series nailed the government-covert operations-drug milieu, and it still remains relevant today. Nothing before or since has come close. Frankly, the darker the series got, the better it got. The shaggier and more agonized Crockett became, the better.Give them credit for continuing to push the envelope. Dirty politics, reflecting both Bush and forecasting Clinton era narco scandals. It was also good to see them stretch, every now and then, into things like Florida's distinctive crime humor with occasional light episode worthy of Charles Willeford and Carl Hiassen. No Jan Hammer?

I would dare  to say that after Vice there has been nothing on tv that could equal, let alone surpass it.I do NOT agree with reviewers saying that Vice ""overstayed it's welcome by becoming a trendfollower after having been a trendsetter in earlier seasons.""It is true that indeed, as a reviewer so eloquently put it, ""the mood and feel of the show had shifted away from the pop-electric neon atmosphere of earlier seasons to a darker and edgier tone beginning with the two-part conclusion to the season four cliffhanger ""Mirror Image"" that ended with Sonny, believing that he is his undercover persona Burnett after suffering total amnesia in a boat explosion, races off in a speedboat after killing an undercover detective.""Of course when Vice as a series progressed in tv time, so did the real decade that Vice was all about (or to use a chiasm; were the 80s about Miami Vice just as well?). The glamour of the earlier part faded away as the 90's with grunge music and a more negative feel were slowly emerging. It might have been a reaction to the glamour of the 80's as is often the case; decades that follow eachother are often like waves. Times do change all the time and so did Vice. Not surprisingly in the 90s and therefore of course the latter part of the 80's (albeit more invisible) the atmosphere would have to reflect somehow in the episodes of Vice as well, and it justly did.Yes, even Sonny changed to stonewashed jeans and I think it was cool, since it was fitting. I think by then his character and the rest of the world had seen almost every pastel Versace blazer ever made by then, so this more down to earth look still gave a cool answer to the question `what could have been cooler than Sonny in silk blazers?'Well, how about Sonny in jeans? Think of it this way: would it have been fitting, or would it have been almost ridiculous, to have shot season 4 and 5 in the same playful atmosphere as the first three? Come on, Jan Hammer had great soundtracksongs, but the music still continued it's quality. Gloomier atmosphere, gloomier music indeed, but it still was great music, even today, that fitted the shows themselves.Maybe the reviewers, including myself, cannot get to terms with the fact that in time generations become less and less naive, or in other words, the world becomes more realistic. Something's gained, something's lost. The price for living in more no nonsense times like now is the loss of idealism. The fun  in earlier seasons, with Sonny and Crockett making jokes in happy Florida was lost, but what was gained was a good timing in shifting the mood. Vice rightfully adapted to newer days without being trendfollowers and that clearly showed in the last seasons. What was gained as well was more excitement and action in the series, and I don't see how reviewers saw this as superficial or Vice becoming trendfollowers instead of trendsetters. Still even then, there was no better copshow or thrill than Vice.The moodshift to more serious stuff to me was also that it seemed to act as a realistic mirror of the hopelessness of fighting the drug force, which it still is to this day. I mean, after so many seasons of fighting the 'vice', what did it amount to? A new episode with a new crime to fight. It had to end, or, the 'ennui' had to be shown in the series, as every good series develops, just like any story plot. It might be true the cast was, as reviewers said, 'riding things out' and things were coming to an end. Exactly, and fortunately this same development, or ennui, which reflected in the series themselves was fitting. Drugs is still impossible to fight, and cops like Sonny and Crockett that did their best in more than 100 episodes were likely to have become burne""tt"" out. Vice had to end, the only question how.Atmittedly, especially in the last season it spiralled alsmost to the absurdly cool, with enormous white empty villa's and drugbosses in clothes that would make a video of Bryan Ferry look like the clip of 'cotton eyed joe'.Sonny and Tubbs indeed became more abstract themselves in this weird atmosphere. Some call this 'one dimensional', but the first three seasons had shown enough introspection of the characters I think. And how about Sonny loosing his wife? That was a character-driven plot to me. Overall, the action, the acting and the music (although changed in style) still gave the series that extra over any other tv series at the time. Ok, it had become decadent, but all good things spiral out of control, especially the unforgettable stuff.I simply thought Vice, and especially the last season was the best stuff our generation had the privilige to see in it's day when it was still new, with the Burnett episodes shot in eerie night blue, his revenge on the killer of his wife and of course the indeed very emotional end. When Sonny drove off in his white car after shaking so shortly the hand of his partner, not only the 80s were lost forever, but also the best show that has ever aired and it would not have been as good as it was without this season. I would like to steal a quote from the booklet of the Stones 2CD 40 Licks by saying: thanks (Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas, Michael Mann) for touching our lives. Although people might say it was only tv, on some very rare occasions, tv transcends itself and defines a definite period in time. Vice did! Even though watching it now will never get you back to times lost, still...go for it!",5,"Before Elvis there was nothing, and after Vice there has been not much either",1179878400,"05 23,

1066423,A10CJINP7KBR4W,B000OVLMKC,M. Herzog,"[5, 6]","My reviews of the other seasons of Miami Vice have pointed out that I did not watch this show while it was on, and am only a recent convert to the show.  I point this out again so that those reading this review know I am not someone whose eyes are covered with a blanket of nostalgia, but just as someone who enjoys watching a great show.  The final season of Miami Vice truly is a bit of a mixed bag.  While I don't know the behind the scence stories, I'd imagine there was some tension between Don Johnson and the rest of the staff as his stories showed a pattern of solely involing him, with the rest of the characters taking more of a back drop.  However, the stories he was not involved gave everyone else a real chance to shine, and show even the supporting characters could hold their own.  While this was an interesting change, it made the show a bit less effective.  The trouble is that the show feels a bit tired this season, though still very entertaining.  It's almost being such an cutting-edge show has weighed down the characters and creative talent, causing them to waiver.  While this didn't ruin the show, far from it in fact, it makes for a weaker season than those past.  That being said, there was still some great entertainment to be had, the return of lombardo, the season/series finale, and a host of others were really good.  But I think the show ending at this point was good, as they stopped just as the show was feeling a bit weaker.  All in all, I really was impressed by this ""80s"" show, though I first watched it two decades later.  I still recomend the final season for no other reason than seeing closure brought to one of the best cop shows of all time.",4,Reaching its logical conclusion,1289520000,"11 12, 2010",2010,1687,"['reviews', 'other', 'seasons', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'did', 'not', 'watch', 'show', 'was', 'am', 'only', 'recent', 'convert', 'show', 'point', 'out', 'again', 'so', 'reading', 'review', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'someone', 'eyes', 'are', 'covered', 'blanket', 'nostalgia', 'just', 'someone', 'who', 'watching', 'great', 'show', 'final', 'season', 'Miami', 'Vice', 'truly', 'bit', 'mixed', 'bag', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'scence', 'stories', ""'d"", 'imagine', 'was', 'tension', 'Don', 'Johnson', 'rest', 'staff', 'stories', 'showed', 'pattern', 'solely', 'involing', 'rest', 'characters', 'taking', 'more', 'back', 'drop', 'However', 'stories', 'was', 'not', 'involved', 'gave', 'everyone', 'else', 'real', 'chance', 'shine', 'show', 'even', 'supporting', 'characters', 'could', 'hold', 'own', 'was', 'interesting', 'change', 'made', 'show', 'bit', 'less', 'effective', 'trouble', 'show', 'bit', 'tired', 'season', 'still', 'very', 'entertaining', 'almost', 'being', 'such', 'cutting-edge', 'show', 'weighed', 'down', 'characters', 'creative', 'talent', 'causing', 'waiver', 'did', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'show', 'far', 'fact', 'weaker', 'season', 'past', 'being', 'said', 'was', 'still', 'great', 'entertainment', 'be', 'had', 'return', 'lombardo', 'season/series', 'finale', 'host', 'others', 'were', 'really', 'good', 'think', 'show', 'ending', 'point', 'was', 'good', 'stopped', 'just', 'show', 'was', 'feeling', 'bit', 'weaker', 'really', 'was', 'impressed', '80s', 'show', 'first', 'watched', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'still', 'recomend', 'final', 'season', 'other', 'reason', 'seeing', 'closure', 'brought', 'one', 'best', 'cop', 'shows', 'time']",Miami Vice: Season Five

1066425,A3B75PP84073DD,B000OVLMKC,Patrick Wall,"[8, 8]","""Miami Vice"" is the greatest cop show of all time and each season has always maintained innovative storylines. Season 5 is one of the strongest seasons of all in my opinion. The first two episodes conclude the Burnett trilogy where Crockett assumed he was his drug dealer undercover alterego. The next episode then features Castillo's personal life and showcases his character in the action very well. A few episodes later we come to ""Bad timing"" with Sonny recovering from his wife's death/amnesia ordeals only to come up against two of the worst baddies ever in vice. Episodes like ""Line of fire"", ""Borrasca"", ""To have and to hold"", ""Miami Squeeze"" and ""Asian cut"" represent straightforward vice at its best and are similar to episodes from series 1-3. On the other hand, episodes like ""The cell within"" (Tubbs reuniting with a sadistic murderer turned author), ""Over the line"" (akin to a similar bad cop episode in season 4), ""Too much too late"" (concluding the Ricardo/Valerie business), ""Hard knocks"" (introducing Stan's gambling problems that would also feature in ""Too much too late"" and ""Freefall""), ""World of trouble"" (concluding the Lombard-Lubrizzi mafia war first raised in season 1) and ""Victims of circumstance"" are all very strong and innovative episodes. More lighthearted episodes include ""The lost madonna"" and ""Jack of all trades"" where the duo face art and sales conmen. On the weaker side there is the ridiculous ""Miracle man"" and the neo-vice sans Tubbs, Crockett and the rest ""Leap of faith"". The climax, ""Freefall"", is arguably the greatest ever episode of MV.

It falls off rather quickly and then goes downhill from there. While some episodes have redeeming value, there are others where the writers should have been shot. Yeah, that's rather harsh.
