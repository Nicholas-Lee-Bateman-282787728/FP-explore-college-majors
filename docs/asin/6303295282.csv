368145,A2HVL790PBWYTU,6303295282,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[5, 5]","Errol Flynn didn't much dip his toe in the romantic comedy genre. But those few times he did, he demonstrated a good knack for levity. Guy always had that devilish gleam in his eyes anyway, even when he was playing the dashing swashbuckler. 1946's NEVER SAY GOODBYE is frothy, lighthearted stuff and certainly delivers plenty of fun moments - even though I don't think it's quite as good as Flynn's other comedies, like FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK and THE PERFECT SPECIMEN. I still haven't seen FOUR'S A CROWD, so I can't yet compare this to that.A year of separation hasn't diminished the ardor between Phillip (Flynn) and Ellen Gayley (Eleanor Parker), although neither will admit to it. What's still on the surface is their doting on their seven-year-old daughter Phillipa (or ""Flip""). Flip splits the year staying with her mom and then her dad, and she still harbors hope that her parents will get back together. Except that Phillip is still very much a famous New York magazine illustrator and still surrounded by gorgeous models. Phillip's appreciative eye is what triggered the divorce, although his disapproving mother-in-law also went a ways in convincing Ellen to end the marriage. But this story takes place during the Christmas holiday, and so Phillip is holding out for a reconciliation. Little Flip aims to help him.If you're casting about for a good Christmas movie you haven't yet seen, odds are NEVER SAY GOODBYE has yet to darken your threshold. This picture has got several things going for it. There's the neat swerve of Errol Flynn starring in a comedy vehicle and effortlessly coaxing chuckles out of the viewing audience. He seems to be having a blast spoofing his swashbuckling image. There's a sequence in which his character Phillip sneaks into his ex-wife's home dressed up as Santa, only to bump into another Santa being played by Ellen's divorce lawyer. Cue several silly shenanigans, including a mirror gag lifted straight out of DUCK SOUP and culminating in Phillip's holiday barb at his mother-in-law. ""Ah, now let's see what we've got here for the old bag - uh, I mean, in the old bag,"" he says. Around this point, everyone in the household penetrates the Santa disguise, to Flip's delight, to Ellen's whimsy, to the mother-in-law's great big outrage.Maybe my favorite comedy bit in the film is when Errol poses as a tough thuggish hombre accosting a romantic rival, except Errol does this with Humphrey Bogart's voice dubbing his snarling dialogue. It's such a damn funny scene. And, as a bonus, Errol even sings a few words of a tune titled ""Remember Me.""Regarding Eleanor Parker, maybe it's enough to say that I'd been steady crushing on her ever since I saw her in THE VOICE OF THE TURTLE years and years ago. Watching her in this one, I'm still smitten. Patti Brady as Flip presents a cute lisp, but for once it's not an annoying cute lisp. The kid's pretty good, and she has these really charming moments with Errol Flynn. Good old S.Z. Sakall has a supporting part as a restaurant owner. Hattie McDaniel is Flip's outspoken nanny. Forrest Tucker figures in as a strapping Marine corporal with whom Flip had been exchanging written correspondence, except that this Marine believes that he's pen pals with Flip's beautiful mother. It's a plot device which the fantastic DEAR RUTH would borrow a year later. Now Forrest Tucker may have demonstrated a physical superiority over Flynn, but no big whoop. Errol Flynn easily had Forrest Tucker over on the stuff what really matters: he's got him licked on looks and charm and in that most relevant of demographics: Most Rakish Mustache (I don't even think Forrest Tucker had a mustache, which only makes Errol Flynn that much more dominant).",4,"""Ah, now let's see what we've got here for the old bag - uh, I mean, in the old bag.""",1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,3718,"['Errol', 'Flynn', 'did', ""n't"", 'much', 'dip', 'toe', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'genre', 'few', 'times', 'did', 'demonstrated', 'good', 'knack', 'levity', 'Guy', 'always', 'had', 'devilish', 'gleam', 'eyes', 'anyway', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'playing', 'dashing', 'swashbuckler', '1946', 'NEVER', 'SAY', 'GOODBYE', 'frothy', 'lighthearted', 'stuff', 'certainly', 'delivers', 'plenty', 'fun', 'moments', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'as', 'good', 'Flynn', 'other', 'comedies', 'FOOTSTEPS', 'IN', 'THE', 'DARK', 'THE', 'PERFECT', 'SPECIMEN', 'still', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'FOUR', 'A', 'CROWD', 'ca', ""n't"", 'yet', 'compare', 'that.A', 'year', 'separation', ""n't"", 'diminished', 'ardor', 'Phillip', 'Flynn', 'Ellen', 'Gayley', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'will', 'admit', 'What', 'still', 'surface', 'doting', 'seven-year-old', 'daughter', 'Phillipa', 'Flip', 'Flip', 'year', 'staying', 'mom', 'then', 'dad', 'still', 'harbors', 'hope', 'parents', 'will', 'get', 'back', 'together', 'Phillip', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'famous', 'New', 'York', 'magazine', 'illustrator', 'still', 'surrounded', 'gorgeous', 'models', 'Phillip', 'appreciative', 'eye', 'what', 'triggered', 'divorce', 'disapproving', 'mother-in-law', 'also', 'went', 'ways', 'convincing', 'Ellen', 'end', 'marriage', 'story', 'place', 'Christmas', 'holiday', 'so', 'Phillip', 'holding', 'out', 'reconciliation', 'Little', 'Flip', 'help', 'him.If', ""'re"", 'casting', 'good', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'odds', 'are', 'NEVER', 'SAY', 'GOODBYE', 'yet', 'darken', 'threshold', 'picture', 'got', 'several', 'things', 'going', 'neat', 'swerve', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'starring', 'comedy', 'vehicle', 'effortlessly', 'coaxing', 'chuckles', 'viewing', 'audience', 'be', 'having', 'blast', 'spoofing', 'swashbuckling', 'image', 'sequence', 'character', 'Phillip', 'ex-wife', 'home', 'dressed', 'up', 'Santa', 'only', 'bump', 'Santa', 'being', 'played', 'Ellen', 'divorce', 'lawyer', 'Cue', 'several', 'silly', 'shenanigans', 'including', 'mirror', 'gag', 'lifted', 'straight', 'DUCK', 'SOUP', 'culminating', 'Phillip', 'holiday', 'barb', 'mother-in-law', 'Ah', 'now', 'let', 'see', 'what', ""'ve"", 'got', 'here', 'old', 'bag', 'uh', 'mean', 'old', 'bag', 'point', 'everyone', 'household', 'Santa', 'disguise', 'Flip', 'delight', 'Ellen', 'whimsy', 'mother-in-law', 'great', 'big', 'outrage.Maybe', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'bit', 'film', 'when', 'Errol', 'tough', 'thuggish', 'hombre', 'accosting', 'romantic', 'rival', 'Errol', 'Humphrey', 'Bogart', 'voice', 'dubbing', 'snarling', 'dialogue', 'such', 'damn', 'funny', 'scene', 'bonus', 'Errol', 'even', 'few', 'words', 'tune', 'titled', 'Remember', 'Me', 'Regarding', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'maybe', 'enough', 'say', ""'d"", 'been', 'steady', 'crushing', 'ever', 'saw', 'THE', 'VOICE', 'THE', 'TURTLE', 'years', 'years', 'ago', 'Watching', 'one', ""'m"", 'still', 'smitten', 'Patti', 'Brady', 'Flip', 'cute', 'lisp', 'not', 'annoying', 'cute', 'lisp', 'kid', 'pretty', 'good', 'really', 'charming', 'moments', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Good', 'old', 'S.Z', 'Sakall', 'supporting', 'part', 'restaurant', 'owner', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'Flip', 'outspoken', 'nanny', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'strapping', 'Marine', 'corporal', 'whom', 'Flip', 'had', 'been', 'exchanging', 'written', 'correspondence', 'Marine', 'pen', 'pals', 'Flip', 'beautiful', 'mother', 'plot', 'device', 'fantastic', 'DEAR', 'RUTH', 'would', 'borrow', 'year', 'later', 'Now', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'may', 'have', 'demonstrated', 'physical', 'superiority', 'Flynn', 'big', 'whoop', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'easily', 'had', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'stuff', 'what', 'really', 'matters', 'got', 'licked', 'looks', 'charm', 'most', 'relevant', 'demographics', 'Most', 'Rakish', 'Mustache', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'Forrest', 'Tucker', 'had', 'mustache', 'only', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'much', 'more', 'dominant']",Never Say Goodbye VHS
368146,A1345VRK5MYG7,6303295282,James L.,"[5, 6]","Errol Flynn gives a very relaxed, engaging performance as an artist, divorced for a year from his wife, who wants her back, which would also please the couple's seven year old daughter very much.  Eleanor Parker is the ex-wife who also has feelings for her ex-husband.  With everybody still loving everybody, getting back together should be easy, but this film tosses many problems in their way.  The script is basically an extended sitcom, with mix-ups, disguises, pratfalls, and a cute kid.  Fortunately, the whole cast seems to be having fun with the material, light as it is, which helps to get past many of the contrived situations.  Flynn and Parker have a breezy chemistry here, and Forrest Tucker, as a Marine caught up in the tangle, is fun too.  Patti Brady, as the little girl, is a natural that doesn't get on your nerves like some kid actors. Humphrey Bogart has an unusual &quot;cameo&quot; that is worth a laugh.

368147,A2GZVA22WYG95I,6303295282,J. Olsen,"[8, 8]","If you have never seen Errol Flynn in one of his more lighthearted roles, this is a good place to start. He plays an artist who paints the pin-up girl type of poster that was popular with the soldiers of WW II. His beautiful ex-wife, who felt he was enjoying his models a little too much, is played by Eleanor Parker. They have a seven-year-old daughter who is wonderfully portrayed by Patti Brady. She is named Phillippa (Flip) after her father, Phillip Gayley. Mr. and Mrs. Gayley have been divorced for a year and Flip is doing the ""six months with Mom, sixth months with Dad"" routine. She wants her parents back together, and secretly that is what they would like as well. But Grandmother is opposed and  Mrs. Gayley and her daughter reside in her home. Though not specifically a Christmas movie, the action takes place over a short period of time and it is around the holiday season. There is a great mix-up scene at Grandmother's house where Flynn is dressed as Santa Claus, but so is the family attorney that Grandmother wants her daughter to marry. They don't realize that Mr. Gayley is there and are surprised by the behavior of the ""attorney"" who is really Flip's Dad just wanting to be with his daughter (and ex-wife) for Christmas.Throughout the movie there are times when Mrs. Gayley thinks her husband has changed and that things really will work out for them, but he seems to be a master at getting himself in hot water. His friend, Luigi (wonderful S. Z. Sakall), tries to help him out in his charmingly bumbling way and usually makes matters worse. To complicate things, Flip has been writing to a soldier--a Marine, actually, with the help of her nurse, Cozy. When her father learns about it and sees the picture of herself that his daughter is about to send him, he substitutes a pin-up of her mother that he had done. When the Marine shows up at Christmas time to see his ""Smoochie"" he, of course, thinks it is Flip's mother. She plays along to make her ex-husband jealous. ""Oh, what a tangled web we weave...""This movie has humor, wit, charm, and even a tender moment or two with a little girl who doesn't want her parents apart, and it is funny to see the nod to Errol Flynn's Robin Hood role. I recommend this movie to all who love a romantic comedy from the classic era. Even if this isn't your genre, I think you may enjoy this one.There are no extras on this disc--not even a chapter menu. The sound and picture quality are good. This is one of the Warner Brother's Archive releases (which were easier to spot when they all had blue covers--but I like the color covers better). That means it is a DVD-R and will not play in a ""play/record"" unit. You need a ""player only"" model to view this disc. It is presented in the 1:33:1 ratio--full screen. Don't let any of this deter you from seeing this movie. It is great fun--highly recommended. Then why only four stars? I think it may deserve four and a half, but it isn't quite what I would give a five star rating.",4,"Errol Flynn in a funny, romantic romp--he even plays Santa!",1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,2987,"['have', 'never', 'seen', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'one', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'roles', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'artist', 'who', 'pin-up', 'girl', 'type', 'poster', 'was', 'popular', 'soldiers', 'WW', 'II', 'beautiful', 'ex-wife', 'who', 'felt', 'was', 'enjoying', 'models', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'played', 'Eleanor', 'Parker', 'have', 'seven-year-old', 'daughter', 'who', 'wonderfully', 'portrayed', 'Patti', 'Brady', 'named', 'Phillippa', 'Flip', 'father', 'Phillip', 'Gayley', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Gayley', 'have', 'been', 'divorced', 'year', 'Flip', 'doing', 'six', 'months', 'Mom', 'sixth', 'months', 'Dad', 'routine', 'parents', 'back', 'together', 'secretly', 'what', 'would', 'like', 'as', 'well', 'Grandmother', 'opposed', 'Mrs.', 'Gayley', 'daughter', 'reside', 'home', 'not', 'specifically', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'action', 'place', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'holiday', 'season', 'great', 'mix-up', 'scene', 'Grandmother', 'house', 'where', 'Flynn', 'dressed', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'so', 'family', 'attorney', 'Grandmother', 'daughter', 'marry', 'do', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Mr.', 'Gayley', 'there', 'are', 'surprised', 'behavior', 'attorney', 'who', 'really', 'Flip', 'Dad', 'just', 'wanting', 'be', 'daughter', 'ex-wife', 'Christmas.Throughout', 'movie', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'Mrs.', 'Gayley', 'husband', 'changed', 'things', 'really', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'be', 'master', 'getting', 'hot', 'water', 'friend', 'Luigi', 'wonderful', 'S.', 'Z.', 'Sakall', 'help', 'out', 'charmingly', 'bumbling', 'way', 'usually', 'matters', 'worse', 'complicate', 'things', 'Flip', 'been', 'writing', 'soldier', 'Marine', 'actually', 'help', 'nurse', 'Cozy', 'When', 'father', 'picture', 'herself', 'daughter', 'send', 'pin-up', 'mother', 'had', 'done', 'When', 'Marine', 'up', 'Christmas', 'time', 'see', 'Smoochie', 'course', 'Flip', 'mother', 'along', 'make', 'ex-husband', 'jealous', 'Oh', 'what', 'tangled', 'web', 'weave', 'movie', 'humor', 'wit', 'charm', 'even', 'tender', 'moment', 'two', 'little', 'girl', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'parents', 'apart', 'funny', 'see', 'nod', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'role', 'recommend', 'movie', 'who', 'love', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'classic', 'era', 'Even', ""n't"", 'genre', 'think', 'may', 'enjoy', 'are', 'extras', 'disc', 'not', 'even', 'chapter', 'menu', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'good', 'one', 'Warner', 'Brother', 'Archive', 'releases', 'were', 'easier', 'spot', 'when', 'had', 'blue', 'covers', 'like', 'color', 'better', 'DVD-R', 'will', 'not', 'play', 'play/record', 'unit', 'need', 'player', 'only', 'model', 'view', 'disc', 'presented', '1:33:1', 'ratio', 'full', 'screen', 'Do', ""n't"", 'let', 'deter', 'seeing', 'movie', 'great', 'fun', 'highly', 'recommended', 'Then', 'why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'think', 'may', 'deserve', 'four', 'half', ""n't"", 'quite', 'what', 'would', 'give', 'five', 'star', 'rating']",Never Say Goodbye VHS

368151,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6303295282,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 1.5 out of 5.0With a top notch cast including Errol Flynn (not known for comedy roles, but acquitting himself very well here), the extremely versatile Eleanor Parker (who appeared in over 80 film and TV roles), Hattie McDaniel (the iconic actress who was the first African-American to win an Oscar), S.Z. Sakall (a Hungarian Jewish character actor most famous for his role in 'Casablanca'), Forrest Tucker (best known for his role in the TV series 'F Troop') and an excellent performance by the child actress Patti Brady (does anyone know what happened to her after she retired from show business?), it's still not too hard to figure out why 'Never Say Goodbye' will never be considered part of the comic film pantheon, today or when it was released back in 1946.The film is billed sort of like the 1961 Disney comedy, 'The Parent Trap', where children conspire to reunite their divorced parents. In 'Never Say Goodbye', the 8 year old 'Flip', actually doesn't take any covert action to reunite her parents Phil (Flynn) and Ellen (Parker) Gayley, until the film's climax.The film's expository sequence introduces us to both Phil and Ellen, who come into a clothing store, looking to buy an outfit for Flip. Ellen opts for a conservative suit but Phil wants something a bit more snazzy. Soon we discover why the couple got divorced in the first place. Ellen was jealous of what she perceived as Phil's philandering. As a high- priced artist/illustrator, Phil is in contact with beautiful models who sit for him as he draws their portraits for various magazines. Phil denies Ellen's belief that he was cheating on her. Still, the couple appear to maintain an affable relationship. A secondary catalyst in the couple's divorce is the role of Ellen's mother, Mrs. Hamilton, who influenced her daughter as she was convinced all long that Phil was not really 'husband' material.The film is divided into three primary comic sequences. In the first sequence, Phil forgets that he invited both Ellen and the model Nancy Graham (whose portrait he's recently been painting) to a dinner date. It's all rather obvious stuff with Phil running back and forth between rooms in the restaurant, in a futile attempt to prevent Ellen learning of his faux pas. S.Z. Sakall gets in the act as 'Luigi', the owner of the restaurant, who obviously isn't Italian but explains at the end of the film that he simply adopted the name of the last owner, as he didn't want to change the name of the restaurant. His contribution is a silly scene where he calls Nancy from an adjoining phone booth and attempts to get her to go to Phil's studio--she of course shortly discovers the ruse and Phil's plan to save himself from Ellen's wrath, evaporates.The second sequence involves Mrs. Hamilton's solicitor, Rex, who dresses up as Santa Claus and is supposed to bring Flip some presents. Phil decides to crash the party and also dresses up as Santa. Phil keeps kissing Ellen but she mistakes him for Rex and doesn't think that's Kosher at all. At one point, there's a scene which has been done countless times before where Rex believes he's looking at a mirror when he spies Phil, who duplicates Rex's moves, to fool him. Despite being unmasked, Ellen finds Phil's aggressiveness quite attractive.The third sequence involves the appearance of Corporal Fenwick Lonkowski (Forrest Tucker). Flip had been writing to him while he was overseas and at Phil's suggestion, she used a picture of Ellen to send to him. When Fenwick shows up at the apartment, Ellen is initially frightened but then decides to use him to make Phil jealous. Phil dresses up as a gangster and speaks like Humphrey Bogart (the famed actor's voice was dubbed in, in an uncredited performance). Fenwick decks Phil and there's also some additional silliness where Phil attempts to match Fenwick's calisthenics prowess.The narrative suddenly concludes with Flip intentionally disappearing coupled with a frantic search where the police are called. Flip actually is with Luigi and due to the shock of having temporarily lost their daughter, both Phil and Ellen decide they actually do love each other and need to be together, to take care of Flip.In the end, 'Never Say Goodbye' is usually quite silly but simply not funny. Most of the humor depends on Ellen's jealousy toward Phil. But the outcome is pre-ordained since the couple still maintain quite an affable relationship and Phil is basically such a nice guy. Often, the humor veers toward slapstick to compensate for the weak comic premise. While all the performances here are quite good, the material doesn't dig deep enough to tickle the funny bone. For true Christmas fare, watch 'It's a Wonderful Life' and skip 'Never Say Goodbye'.",1,Expert cast can't save rom com which fails to tickle the funny bone,1401321600,"05 29, 2014",2014,4770,"['***',
