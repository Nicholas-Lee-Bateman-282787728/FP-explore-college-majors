757352,A69ORVVZQ6BJN,B00009RDHH,A Customer,"[30, 30]","Monarch of the Glen is one of the more charming television series to come out of the UK. It follows the troubles and tribulations of the MacDonald clan, who's young laird, Archie, has been put in charge of leading the family estate out of debt. It's not as easy as it sounds, as Archie not only tries to balance the wishes of his mother and father with the agendas of the the estate's workers, but most also choose between his life in London with restaurateur business partner Justine, or live in Glenbogle with the mysterious Katrina.The locations are beautiful, the writing top-notch, and the performances are a delight to watch. Alastair Mackenzie is the center of the ensemble as Laird Archie, but is nicely rounded out by the other performers, the most outstanding in this first series being Dawn Steele as the feisty cook, Lexie, and Hamish Clark as the bumbling handyman, Duncan.The 2-Disc DVD presentation of the first series is just as well-produced as the program the discs hold. The picture is spot-less with little noticeable PAL-to-NTSC conversion artifacts, and is presented in 16x9 enhanced wide-screen looking far better than the show has aired on BBC America or PBS. The 2.0 sound mix is clear and dialogue is always intelligible. There is little in the way of extras, simply cast biographies and a six minute excerpt from BBC series &quot;Holiday&quot; about the locations that Monarch uses and brief interviews with the actors.If you're looking for an American program to compare this to the closest that I could point you to is &quot;Ed,&quot; but even then, Ed is never as good-natured and beautifully produced as this fine Scottish gem.

757353,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B00009RDHH,Alice L. Moore,"[0, 0]","This series has eight episodes on the DVD.  It is a strong ensemble drama/comedy.What I like:  The scenery of Scotland.  The premise of a 21st Century Scottish Laird having real 21st Century concerns.  The estate is not only home but, must also be an ongoing productive concern.  We can all identify trying to get credit extension from a bank.  You can only be amused thinking of say, Mary Queen of Scots, having to go through this.  The actors Hamish Clark as Duncan and Alexander Morton as Golly are compelling characters.Other matters:  I know this is an ensemble series.  However, even ensembles need a strong anchor character.  For example, Star Trek=Captain Kirk.  Alisdair Mackenzie sometimes seems overwhelmed by the other characters.  Whether it's, Katrina, Lexie, Duncan, or Hector, his screen oxygen seems to be taken away from him when the others appear.  His love interest/business partner, Justine, is not likable.  The writers have made his end choices obvious.  Having Justine as less of a BOW would have made things better for an already excellent series.I would recommend the series to those who like ensembles of any genre.

The scenery alone will keep you spellbound long enough to get to know all the characters. The show is so well written that all the players are real, complex people.Archie MacDonald has just opened a restaurent in London with his girlfriend when he is called back to his home in the Scottish highlands. His parents tell him that he is now Laird of his ancestral home of Glenbogle and it's in trouble, 300,000 pounds in debt. Archie must decide whether to just sell the land that has been in his family for 400 years or stay and try to save it any way he can.Archie's conflict of wanting to save the estate but also feeling like he never belonged there in the first place drive this first series. Along the way family secrets and tragedies are revealed that explain some of Archie's feelings and especially the behavior of his irrascible and slightly loony father Hector. The series is essentially a drama with humor and romance thrown into the mix. It is so well done that everything blends together perfectly.

Fortunately I've been privileged to discover a number of series that fall into that category, most recently Monarch of the Glen. This one definitely moves the action to a location different from any series watched to this date.This one is set in the highlands of Scotland amidst beautiful lakes, mountains and valleys; that alone would make the series notable in my opinion. The story is filled with interesting characters whose actions and motivations all contribute to an absorbing storyline. The hero of the story is a young second son who is compelled by circumstances to return to the familie's castle in the highlands of Scotland. Further surprises await him when he makes some life changing discoveries concerning his status in the family.The video and audio are good, the acting and scenery are good and the characters are interesting enough to generate some concern about what happens to them.

Since it's the beginning of this century rather than the last, many members of the aristocracy are no longer wealthy, and the ongoing struggle to save Glenbogle, the grand but increasingly decrepit McDonald family estate, is one of the main drivers of the plot. Archie McDonald, just made Laird (Lord) after his father steps down, is forced to give up his life in London and the restaurant he was planning to run with Justine, his sophisticated girlfriend, so he can help his cheerful but fiscally clueless parents figure out how to keep Glenbogle solvent.

Finally broke over and got the DVD and I'm very glad I did.Let's just start with the view.  Scotland's one of the most beautiful places I have ever been and the producers of this series took full advantage of the country's scenic endowments.  The music is not just carefully placed bagpipes, it's a mix of traditional and contemporary instrumentals that enhances the scenes.  And of course the acting.  The well-chosen ensemble cast plays off of each other beautifully.So, what happens?  In the beginning, Archie MacDonald is a London restauranteur who is concerned about getting the business running right.  He gets a call from Glenbogle, Scotland that his father Hector has been hurt in the Loch and rushes home to help.  He arrives to find that his father is fine and feisty as ever, but the estate's in trouble and they've made him laird.  He's got to stay and help despite the havoc this wreaks on his personal and business relationship.  As Archie learns to work with the people and the land, he's growing fond of the place and it's more and more doubtful that he will return to his previous life.Rebecca Kyle, September 2009",5,"Delightful ""MacInations""",1254182400,"09 29, 2009",2009,1269,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'asked', 'years', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Monarch', 'Glen', 'alas', 'was', ""n't"", 'carried', 'PBS', 'stations', 'area', 'Finally', 'broke', 'got', 'DVD', ""'m"", 'very', 'glad', 'did.Let', 'just', 'start', 'view', 'Scotland', 'one', 'most', 'beautiful', 'places', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'producers', 'series', 'took', 'full', 'advantage', 'country', 'scenic', 'endowments', 'music', 'not', 'just', 'carefully', 'placed', 'bagpipes', 'mix', 'traditional', 'contemporary', 'instrumentals', 'scenes', 'course', 'acting', 'well-chosen', 'ensemble', 'cast', 'other', 'beautifully.So', 'what', 'beginning', 'Archie', 'MacDonald', 'London', 'restauranteur', 'who', 'concerned', 'getting', 'business', 'running', 'right', 'call', 'Glenbogle', 'Scotland', 'father', 'Hector', 'been', 'hurt', 'Loch', 'home', 'help', 'find', 'father', 'fine', 'feisty', 'ever', 'estate', 'trouble', ""'ve"", 'made', 'laird', 'got', 'stay', 'help', 'havoc', 'personal', 'business', 'relationship', 'Archie', 'work', 'people', 'land', 'growing', 'fond', 'place', 'more', 'more', 'doubtful', 'will', 'return', 'previous', 'life.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'September', '2009']",N/A
