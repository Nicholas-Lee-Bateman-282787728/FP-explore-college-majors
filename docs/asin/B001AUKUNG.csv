I didn't know how deep she was until I watched this--but not all the meditation and dieting and wisdom in the world will help a person who won't stop using.

1168401,A2LM63N9PMRWKQ,B001AUKUNG,Kylie Norahs,"[2, 2]","Watching this documentary was surreal.Lisa has created a beautiful film and legacy of her short life. I always loved TLC's music, but I never knew much about them as individuals. I am happy Lisa gave us all the opportunity to get to know her by making this, and a recap of her life up to that time. This documentary is captivating. I believe Lisa did have a Spirit that was amist to transform her and take her away on her continuing journey in the universe.Sad and eerie that this film came at the end of her life though, and that the last seconds of it were caught on film. She seemed to be looking forward and had many plans on where to go in her life. I just wanted to reach inside the tube and grab a hold of that steering wheel to help her. The documentary never said what caused the accident, or maybe I missed that part. Maybe I wanted to miss it.Thank you Lisa for the peak inside your Soul and for leaving us many things to ponder in our own lives.It's been over 7 years now, but Lisa still seems ever present.This is a must addition to your TLC and Lisa Lopes collection. I think if T-boz and Chilli continued on with TLC, it just would not have been the same. Lisa was irreplaceable. Thank you girls for the fabulous music!You are missed Lefteye! God bless you!",5,Loving Lisa,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2009,1272,"['Watching', 'documentary', 'was', 'surreal.Lisa', 'created', 'beautiful', 'film', 'legacy', 'short', 'life', 'always', 'loved', 'TLC', 'music', 'never', 'knew', 'much', 'individuals', 'am', 'happy', 'Lisa', 'gave', 'opportunity', 'get', 'know', 'making', 'recap', 'life', 'up', 'time', 'documentary', 'captivating', 'believe', 'Lisa', 'did', 'have', 'Spirit', 'was', 'amist', 'transform', 'take', 'away', 'continuing', 'journey', 'universe.Sad', 'eerie', 'film', 'came', 'end', 'life', 'last', 'seconds', 'were', 'caught', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'had', 'many', 'plans', 'where', 'go', 'life', 'just', 'wanted', 'reach', 'tube', 'grab', 'hold', 'steering', 'wheel', 'help', 'documentary', 'never', 'said', 'what', 'caused', 'accident', 'maybe', 'missed', 'part', 'Maybe', 'wanted', 'miss', 'it.Thank', 'Lisa', 'peak', 'Soul', 'leaving', 'many', 'things', 'ponder', 'own', 'lives.It', 'been', '7', 'years', 'now', 'Lisa', 'still', 'ever', 'present.This', 'must', 'addition', 'TLC', 'Lisa', 'Lopes', 'collection', 'think', 'T-boz', 'Chilli', 'continued', 'TLC', 'just', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'same', 'Lisa', 'was', 'irreplaceable', 'Thank', 'girls', 'fabulous', 'music', 'are', 'missed', 'Lefteye', 'God', 'bless']",Last Days Of Left Eye
1168402,A3B1EE263NXT6E,B001AUKUNG,Mike W.,"[32, 35]","This is the last film by TLC group member Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes.  She filmed most of it in Honduras in late March and throughout April 2002, and the idea behind it was to give her fans an inside look into her life.  So they could get to know her better, through her own words and videos, and not just what's reported in the media.The film starts off with Lisa leaving the U.S. and heading off to her spiritual retreat in Honduras.  While Lisa narrates (with voiceovers and audio clips from previous interviews she did), you see rare photos and old film clips of Lisa Lopes when she was a baby and as a teen.  She talks about her turbulent childhood and growing up under a very strict father.  And she tells the story about how TLC began, talks about her ex-boyfriend Andre Rison and the infamous fire incident at his mansion.  She also talks about her interest in numerology and being spiritual.Unfortunately Lisa did not live to finish this documentary, but after seeing what she did film, in my opinion, I felt I got to know her much better.  I definitely saw a different side to her as opposed to what i've seen previously (ex. the interviews, videos, etc).  I see she had a sense of humor.  She was gifted (could play the piano by ear at the age of four), and she was artistic.  But she also had deep emotional pain/problems too (ex. carving the word ""hate"" on her arm).The picture quality is good and the sound is in stereo.  But for some reason, the song ""Let's Just Do It"" isn't on this DVD (at least not my copy).  I received an email response from the Left Eye Legacy website and they stated that VH1 was provided with the song, but for some reason they didn't put it on the DVD.  Hmmmm.  And the DVD is also censored (any nudity is digitally concealed).  Also it would have been great to have had more clips, and any other interviews she did when she was alive.  The video extras are ok, but they are the same ones you can see on the VH1 website.  I understand that the upcoming ""Eye-Legacy"" cd will have more deleted scenes from this documentary, but why couldn't they have just put those scenes on this DVD?  That would have been more appropriate in my opinion.Also, there are two things regarding this film that I believe are not accurate:1.  At least as best as I can tell, after watching this DVD in slow motion a few times, Lisa Lopes was NOT wearing a seatbelt.  I didn't see ANY type of restraint device in use - no shoulder belt or lap/waist seat belt.  Nothing.  It's also ironic that after the accident clip where she loses her life, you see the following sentence come up on screen:""Lopes, who was wearing her seat belt, was the only fatality.""I didn't see her wearing any seat belt.2.  Another thing that isn't accurate is the timeline.  In the film, after the graphic: ""day 25 of filming"" is shown, you then hear about the accident that happened while she was in Honduras - a child ran in front of the van Lisa was riding in.  The van hits the child (Bayron Fuentes Lopez), who later dies at a hospital.  The film gives the impression that the accident happened in late April and then Lisa Lopes lost her life two or three days later.  From what i've read this is not true.  The accident involving the boy took place on April 6, 2002.  Which is in early April.  Lisa Lopes lost her life on April 25, 2002.  Late April.  So this is a few weeks difference, NOT a few days as the documentary seems to state.  Or at least gives the impression.Another thing that I didn't like: VH1 put promotional clips of the upcoming ""Flavor of Love: 3"" and ""I Love New York: 3"" reality series on this DVD.  Oh brother!!  Thankfully you can fast forward past this stuff, but this does, in my opinion, cheapen the DVD.  Who wants to see clips of the reality trash, when you have a REAL and touching film to watch already?  But given that this ""Rockdocs"" documentary is a VH1 production....I first remember seeing Lisa Lopes back in 1992, at the beginning of the ""Ain't to Proud to Beg"" video taking off those huge sunglasses and showing those big, round, beautiful eyes she had.  I was infatuated with her ever since.It's sad she's not here now.  But before her passing, she did live her life.  She traveled around the world.  Made good music.  Lived, loved and laughed.  She was still young, very beautiful, captivating and full of life.  And she had much more to accomplish.  A tragic loss.  But at least we still have her music (Check outSupernova) to listen to and this documentary to watch and appreciate.If you are a fan of Left Eye and/or the group TLC, you should definitely get this DVD.",4,"A disturbing, yet very touching film....",1229990400,"12 23, 2008",2008,4600,"['last', 'film', 'TLC', 'group', 'member', 'Lisa', 'Left', 'Eye', 'Lopes', 'filmed', 'most', 'Honduras', 'late', 'March', 'April', '2002', 'idea', 'was', 'give', 'fans', 'inside', 'look', 'life', 'could', 'get', 'know', 'better', 'own', 'words', 'videos', 'not', 'just', 'what', 'reported', 'media.The', 'film', 'Lisa', 'leaving', 'U.S.', 'heading', 'off', 'spiritual', 'retreat', 'Honduras', 'Lisa', 'narrates', 'voiceovers', 'audio', 'clips', 'previous', 'interviews', 'did', 'see', 'rare', 'photos', 'old', 'film', 'clips', 'Lisa', 'Lopes', 'when', 'was', 'baby', 'teen', 'turbulent', 'childhood', 'growing', 'up', 'very', 'strict', 'father', 'story', 'how', 'TLC', 'began', 'talks', 'ex-boyfriend', 'Andre', 'Rison', 'infamous', 'fire', 'incident', 'mansion', 'also', 'interest', 'numerology', 'being', 'spiritual.Unfortunately', 'Lisa', 'did', 'not', 'live', 'finish', 'documentary', 'seeing', 'what', 'did', 'film', 'opinion', 'felt', 'got', 'know', 'much', 'better', 'definitely', 'saw', 'different', 'side', 'opposed', 'what', 'i', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'previously', 'ex', 'interviews', 'videos', 'etc', 'see', 'had', 'sense', 'humor', 'was', 'gifted', 'could', 'play', 'piano', 'ear', 'age', 'four', 'was', 'artistic', 'also', 'had', 'deep', 'emotional', 'pain/problems', 'too', 'ex', 'carving', 'word', 'hate', 'arm', 'picture', 'quality', 'good', 'sound', 'stereo', 'reason', 'song', 'Let', 'Just', 'Do', ""n't"", 'DVD', 'least', 'not', 'copy', 'received', 'email', 'response', 'Left', 'Eye', 'Legacy', 'website', 'stated', 'VH1', 'was', 'provided', 'song', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'DVD', 'Hmmmm', 'DVD', 'also', 'censored', 'nudity', 'digitally', 'concealed', 'Also', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'clips', 'other', 'interviews', 'did', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'video', 'extras', 'are', 'ok', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'can', 'see', 'VH1', 'website', 'understand', 'upcoming', 'Eye-Legacy', 'cd', 'will', 'have', 'more', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'documentary', 'why', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'just', 'put', 'scenes', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'appropriate', 'opinion.Also', 'are', 'two', 'things', 'regarding', 'film', 'believe', 'are', 'not', 'accurate:1', 'least', 'as', 'best', 'can', 'tell', 'watching', 'DVD', 'slow', 'motion', 'few', 'times', 'Lisa', 'Lopes', 'was', 'NOT', 'wearing', 'seatbelt', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'ANY', 'type', 'restraint', 'device', 'use', 'shoulder', 'belt', 'lap/waist', 'seat', 'belt', 'Nothing', 'also', 'ironic', 'accident', 'clip', 'where', 'life', 'see', 'following', 'sentence', 'come', 'up', 'screen', 'Lopes', 'who', 'was', 'wearing', 'seat', 'belt', 'was', 'only', 'fatality', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'wearing', 'seat', 'belt.2', 'thing', ""n't"", 'accurate', 'timeline', 'film', 'graphic', 'day', '25', 'filming', 'shown', 'then', 'hear', 'accident', 'happened', 'was', 'Honduras', 'child', 'ran', 'front', 'van', 'Lisa', 'was', 'riding', 'van', 'child', 'Bayron', 'Fuentes', 'Lopez', 'who', 'later', 'hospital', 'film', 'impression', 'accident', 'happened', 'late', 'April', 'then', 'Lisa', 'Lopes', 'lost', 'life', 'two', 'three', 'days', 'later', 'what', 'i', ""'ve"", 'read', 'not', 'true', 'accident', 'involving', 'boy', 'took', 'place', 'April', '6', '2002', 'Which', 'early', 'April', 'Lisa', 'Lopes', 'lost', 'life', 'April', '25', '2002', 'Late', 'April', 'few', 'weeks', 'difference', 'NOT', 'few', 'days', 'documentary', 'state', 'least', 'impression.Another', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'VH1', 'put', 'promotional', 'clips', 'upcoming', 'Flavor', 'Love', '3', 'Love', 'New', 'York', '3', 'reality', 'series', 'DVD', 'Oh', 'brother', 'Thankfully', 'can', 'fast', 'forward', 'stuff', 'opinion', 'cheapen', 'DVD', 'Who', 'see', 'clips', 'reality', 'trash', 'when', 'have', 'REAL', 'touching', 'film', 'watch', 'already', 'given', 'Rockdocs', 'documentary', 'VH1', 'production', 'first', 'remember', 'seeing', 'Lisa', 'Lopes', 'back', '1992', 'beginning', 'Ai', ""n't"", 'Proud', 'Beg', 'video', 'taking', 'off', 'huge', 'sunglasses', 'showing', 'big', 'round', 'beautiful', 'eyes', 'had', 'was', 'infatuated', 'ever', 'since.It', 'sad', 'not', 'here', 'now', 'passing', 'did', 'live', 'life', 'traveled', 'world', 'Made', 'good', 'music', 'Lived', 'loved', 'laughed', 'was', 'still', 'young', 'very', 'beautiful', 'captivating', 'full', 'life', 'had', 'much', 'more', 'accomplish', 'tragic', 'loss', 'least', 'still', 'have', 'music', 'Check', 'outSupernova', 'listen', 'documentary', 'watch', 'appreciate.If', 'are', 'fan', 'Left', 'Eye', 'group', 'TLC', 'should', 'definitely', 'get', 'DVD']",Last Days Of Left Eye
