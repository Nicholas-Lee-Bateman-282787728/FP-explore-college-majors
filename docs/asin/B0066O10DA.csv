The land that they live in seems really fleshed out, the art is engaging to me, and I just love the characters.The problem is some things just seem to happen and you don't get to know why, and I've heard that it has a lot of translation errors.Both of these things lead to a lot of whats going on here headscratcher moments.The story involves war, religion, love, family, and crazy weird superpowers. Mix in a little bit of steampunk and Nausicaa (I hope I spelled that right, its a cool old anime) and you get this! have fun!",4,"So confusing, but so good",1399334400,"05 6, 2014",2014,623,"['reason', 'flaws-and', 'are', 'quite', 'few-', 'really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'land', 'live', 'really', 'fleshed', 'out', 'art', 'engaging', 'just', 'love', 'characters.The', 'problem', 'things', 'just', 'seem', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'know', 'why', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'lot', 'translation', 'errors.Both', 'things', 'lead', 'lot', 'whats', 'going', 'here', 'moments.The', 'story', 'war', 'religion', 'love', 'family', 'crazy', 'weird', 'superpowers', 'Mix', 'little', 'bit', 'steampunk', 'Nausicaa', 'hope', 'spelled', 'right', 'cool', 'old', 'anime', 'get', 'have', 'fun']",Xam'd: Lost Memories Complete Collection

1511105,A1AQ477HH3KQ8P,B0066O10DA,RavenRing,"[9, 9]","Akiyuki Takehara is a high schooler living on the tranquil island of Sentan. He goes to school with his two best friends, Haru and Furuichi, and lives a relatively ordinary life. That all changes when he is accidentally involved in a bus bombing and is bestowed with the dubious power to transform into a strange creature called a Xam'd. The transformation is not without price however, as those that spend to much time in the Xam'd shape start to turn to stone. Saved by a young woman named Nakiami, Akiyuki is rather forcibly removed from his home and employed on a mail ship. Now he must learn to control his new power and try to find a way back home.This series was weird. It was interesting, then boring, then confusing, then interesting, then confusing, then it ended. The world we are introduced to is interesting and mysterious. Akiyuki was something of an interesting character and he goes through quite a bit of character development. The supporting cast is varied and carry the story well.I think the problem I had with the series was scale. There are two major plot lines. Akiyuki and Sentan Island. But within that we have multiple sub plot-lines. On Sentan, we have at least 3 different characters to follow, each doing something different. Akiyuki has his story as well as the task of explaining the world, the Xam'd, the Hiruko, and the war. The set up is all very promising, but they just couldn't fit everything in. They do try to wrap everything up, but it comes together in kind of a mess. It it would have been much more interesting if they had cut a few of the sub-plots and fleshed out the main story.I was intrigued when I started. I was curious and interested. For about the first half. Not to say I wasn't entertained by the second half, and I sort of liked the ending, but all in all I felt like it was a good show that tried too much and suffered for it. But, hey, for under $50 you could just get it and try it for yourself.
