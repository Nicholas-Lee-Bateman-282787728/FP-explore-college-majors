The spiritual value in this product is too high for me to even try and quantify.  ""Baby"" Christians as well as mature ones will find value here.  This can literally be a ""life changing"" product - and I don't say that lightly at all.  An EXCELLENT study either for church groups or individuals.There are 6 episodes that are each 30 minutes long (give or take).  The 6 episodes weave together a very interesting story that will draw you in immediately, and when you reach the end of 1 episode you will find yourself WANTING to see the next one to find out more.Although the cost of this is expensive (at least $50 at this writing) and after ordering I wondered if I would regret it, I found it worth every penny and actually much more! However, from a practical perspective, it really bothers me that the creators would price it so high, as that fact alone, by necessity, will GREATLY limit the amount of ministry potential that this excellent product has.  I don't know if the creators/Kyle Idleman realize that or not, but they need to.  This is a series that all Christians should watch.  But at such high prices, many that otherwise might, won't due to the price - which is a real shame given the vital importance of the message which it was developed to bring.Note: There is a Not a Fan ""movie"", which is much less expensive - I have watched it also and while it is OK (it is missing approximately half the footage), I do not believe it is nearly as effective as the study.Although this is billed as a ""small groups study"" that was developed for churches - and I believe it would be excellent when used that way - it can just as easily be viewed independently at home (that's what I did). In fact, it might even be more effective that way.  Personally, I watched one a day and after watching each one, I mentally went through the included guide & exercise book, both of which ask some good questions and had some worthwhile exercises that I found truly helpful to help reinforce what I watched. In general they were an excellent companion to the DVD.  With that said, I do have one warning: Personally I believe a few of the ""crazier"" exercises that are suggested in the companion book are not only not wise to do, but can open doors to the enemy that shouldn't be opened. The exercises that say things like ""this may seem awkward to do, but do it anyway"", I believe you should be very careful with doing them - please make sure you are very sensitive to the Lord on those things - our words and actions matter a lot (far more than we often realize) and although the intended goal of those exercises is good, some of them I believe can actually, albeit in ignorance, possibly open doors to the enemy.  For instance, one of the wilder exercises suggests creating an altar to things you might be enslaved such as alcohol and trying to worship at that altar.  The goal of the exercise is noble - it is to have you realize how silly it is to actually worship something like alcohol.  But I personally believe such actions are unwise, even in such a context.All in all, this is an EXCELLENT show/study with a message that couldn't be more timely for the Church right now.

167609,A2NZ0ZY14PEKQF,0982939809,Donna,"[1, 1]","I highly recommend the leaders pack and then a book for each person. Even couple should have their own individual books as the lessons are to be worked on daily and personally.Kyle Idleman has a unique approach to seeing and getting to know God. How do you talk to God? Do you approach Him as someone to fear? Or someone more like a friend? Pretend God is in the chair next to you, do you see Him? Look harder. Now pray & talk to Him as if He were your best friend.Our group had been together 6 months before we started this impactful series. We became intimate with God, ourselves and shared with each other.The DVD is a must for all, especially visual learners. The thought provoking DVD was powerful from bursts of joy to tears of sadness.I would not recommend this series to a group that is just starting. It is also imperative for the leaders to read the easy to follow leaders guide entirely and review at least one week in advance. For the best impact-the leaders should complete their lessons 2 weeks before the group. It was helpful to explain to the group, ""This week we will do...together. I found day 4 will take you some extra time.""Even though there are 6 lessons, some lessons we took two weeks to complete due to their intensity & length. Perfect for the 10 week/quarterly group.Would I recommend this series?

167611,A1QY9O49W3G684,0982939809,Patricia Hager,"[24, 24]","Our church is presently showing this video series weekly. I was so impressed with it and could not wait another week to see the next video that I ordered entire set. If you are wanting to radically change how you view yourself as a Christian then purchase the set. If you are satisfied with the hum drum daily walk you may now experience then I do not suggest you spend the money. Our pastor said that it might clear out some of the people from our church once they viewed it. I agree because some people call themselves Christians and yet they have not experienced the fullness of being a follower of Jesus Christ. I needed a change in my walk because I honestly fell under the being a fan and not a follower. That disturbed me greatly because I asked myself how willing I was to make sacrifices like the main character in the video was willing to do. It cost him everything but in the end the joy he experienced as a believer was so endearing and so powerful to witness. Yes, it is a story. But it can be about any one of us who is just getting by as a Christian who is not empowered and who has never allowed the true Christian experience to reach our hearts. It has to be a head and a heart experience to truly call ourselves believers in Him. Someone here asked what comes with the study. You get the dvd's that have six weeks of study and each builds on the previous week telling the story of this young man who had to have a heart attack to realize he was not where he was supposed to be. You also get the Not a Fan journal which is good to write in each day of the six week study. You can look back and see what you have learned each week and I advise you not to take this lightly. I am a journal writer anyways and so keeping it up was not too difficult. I guess what it boils down to is this...are you satisfied with where you are at as a Christian? Are you just a fan of Jesus Christ or do you desire to really commit and be His follower regardless of what it costs you? Sadly, many are destined to remain in the fan column but I could not stay there personally any longer. It impacted me so much I ordered a set for both my grown children and I pray they watch it and also realize they need change in their walk to. I hope this helps whoever is sitting on the fence about spending almost $50 to order this set. Do not buy the pastors set because I did thinking it had the weekly videos in it and I had to reorder the group study set to get the entire study on dvd.",5,Not a Fan Group study dvd set,1330041600,"02 24, 2012",2012,2476,"['church', 'presently', 'showing', 'video', 'series', 'weekly', 'was', 'so', 'impressed', 'could', 'not', 'wait', 'week', 'see', 'next', 'video', 'ordered', 'entire', 'set', 'are', 'wanting', 'radically', 'change', 'how', 'view', 'Christian', 'then', 'purchase', 'set', 'are', 'satisfied', 'hum', 'drum', 'daily', 'walk', 'may', 'now', 'experience', 'then', 'do', 'not', 'suggest', 'spend', 'money', 'pastor', 'said', 'might', 'clear', 'out', 'people', 'church', 'viewed', 'agree', 'people', 'call', 'Christians', 'yet', 'have', 'not', 'experienced', 'fullness', 'being', 'follower', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'needed', 'change', 'walk', 'honestly', 'fell', 'being', 'fan', 'not', 'follower', 'disturbed', 'greatly', 'asked', 'how', 'willing', 'was', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'main', 'character', 'video', 'was', 'willing', 'do', 'cost', 'everything', 'end', 'joy', 'experienced', 'believer', 'was', 'so', 'endearing', 'so', 'powerful', 'witness', 'Yes', 'story', 'can', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'just', 'getting', 'Christian', 'who', 'not', 'empowered', 'who', 'never', 'allowed', 'true', 'Christian', 'experience', 'reach', 'hearts', 'be', 'head', 'heart', 'experience', 'truly', 'call', 'ourselves', 'believers', 'Him', 'Someone', 'here', 'asked', 'what', 'study', 'get', 'dvd', 'have', 'six', 'weeks', 'study', 'builds', 'previous', 'week', 'telling', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'have', 'heart', 'attack', 'realize', 'was', 'not', 'where', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'also', 'get', 'Not', 'Fan', 'journal', 'good', 'write', 'day', 'six', 'week', 'study', 'can', 'look', 'back', 'see', 'what', 'have', 'learned', 'week', 'advise', 'not', 'take', 'lightly', 'am', 'journal', 'writer', 'anyways', 'so', 'keeping', 'up', 'was', 'not', 'too', 'difficult', 'guess', 'what', 'down', 'are', 'satisfied', 'where', 'are', 'Christian', 'Are', 'just', 'fan', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'do', 'desire', 'really', 'commit', 'be', 'follower', 'regardless', 'what', 'Sadly', 'many', 'are', 'destined', 'remain', 'fan', 'column', 'could', 'not', 'stay', 'there', 'personally', 'longer', 'impacted', 'so', 'much', 'ordered', 'set', 'grown', 'children', 'pray', 'watch', 'also', 'realize', 'need', 'change', 'walk', 'hope', 'helps', 'whoever', 'sitting', 'fence', 'spending', 'almost', '50', 'order', 'set', 'Do', 'not', 'buy', 'pastors', 'set', 'did', 'thinking', 'had', 'weekly', 'videos', 'had', 'reorder', 'group', 'study', 'set', 'get', 'entire', 'study', 'dvd']",N/A
