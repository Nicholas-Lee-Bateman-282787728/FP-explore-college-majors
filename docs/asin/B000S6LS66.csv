That is why it is very rare when a comedian achieves broad and varid success. Such is the case of Jeff Dunham and his famous(infamous?) cadre of puppets, who have created one of the most recognazible acts in show business and three of the most heavily rotated specials on Comedy Central. Needless to say, in my humble opinion, Jeff Dunham is VERY funny.Now available ob Blu Ray disc, Arguing With Myself, Spark of Insanity and The Jeff Dunham Christmas Special are filled with plenty of laughs and funny moments one will enjoy again and again. I tend to buy very little discs of this type mainly because after repeated viewings, the material (understandibly) loses it's punch. However after many, and in some instances consecutive, times in my BD player, I have to say I find them all still quite funny. This particular disc (Spark of Insanity) features the debut  (on TV at least) of Achmed, the Dead Terrorist, who has become apparently(by the number of viewings on YouTube) the most famous of Dunham creations. For my money however, you can't beat Peanut. I like him for the same reason I like Eric Cartman: They have absolutely no inhibitions. No ""edit"" button. Jeff Dunham's id if you will. Watching Dunham react to what Peanut says is always funny. If it sounds like I'm convinced that Dunham and Walter, Peanut, Bubba J.and the others are completely seperate, thinking entities, then you can draw a pretty good picture of just how good Jeff Dunham really is. It's not just that he is a good ventriloquist(in that regard, I have seen better), it's the fact that all his puppets, even Jose Jalapeno(on a steek...) have clear, defined characters. Watching these on TV instead of live gives you an advantage over the live crowd as the various camera angles add to the effect of Jeff and his subjects being seperate personalities.Of course, these being Blu-Ray discs, they look AWSOME, especially compared to the DVD's and TV. For me this was a must-buy and I highly enjoy all of his material so far.WARNINGWhen buying these discs, I was tempted to buy the three-pack that contains all three titles. I was shocked to see it costs $80+. Seeing the individual prices of each disc, it didn't add up. Putting each disc seperately in the shopping cart gives youa total of forty-something dollars. ALMOST HALF THE COST OF THE SET!!!

1085268,A1YTR8FI6UPMA6,B000S6LS66,Get Serious,"[0, 0]","As a writer, I understand how Dunham puts these together. His formula is tried and true. He introduces a seed-subject early on and continually loops back within the joke-pak to revive this. He utilizes prejudices, biases, sexuality and bathroom humor all through innuendo, rather than blatant obnoxiousness (which is why it's particularly attractive to women). This particular rendition is not as good as some others in that it has no real subject and I can see that he ad-libbed the silliness with the puppets for silliness' sake. The idea is to insult the audience and he gets away with it because it's a multi-color psycho puppet doing the insulting rather than a stand-up comedian (which can piss off a lot of people and is the main reason a lot of stand-up comedians lose their careers). With Achmed he has now entered the realm of propaganda and political bias...and he pushes the envelope here and may piss off a lot of people! The chili pepper puppet doesn't piss off too many people, because most of the country dislikes the Mexicans taking over our southern states. Jonathan Winters was the early master of this methodology, utilizing different characters through dress-up, although he wasn't a ventriloquist. But if you look at Winter's life, in which he spent a lot of time in therapy, creating multiple pseudo-egos can be dangerous for the psyche and there is a burn-out limit. Dunham is a superior ventriloquist, having almost no lip movement and is able to keep three parallel dialogs with different voices going at the same time, but this could be detrimental.

1085322,AO4CIKY7Q1REK,B000S6LS66,"L. B. Godin ""lgodin5""","[6, 12]","I discovered Jeff Dunham on an HBO special of the same title of Spark of Insanity and I was absolutely amazed by his originality. Dunham is amazingly not the predictable ventriloquist for several reasons. One, he's focused on as well as his dolls, which is rare, and all you can see is his throat barely move while his lips don't move at all. Most ventriloquists are too obvious. Second, his five characters are original both in voice and personality. Most ventriloquists have trouble making each character separate. Jeff is also amazing because his characters have clear diction, while most ventriloquists have problems with certain sounds.Peanut the alien looking doll is strikingly manic and took a couple viewings to get used to. He either grows on you or you'll completely dislike him. He's an upper without being annoying. I loved his kidding about Dunham's last name by calling him Jeff Dun-HAM and calling Jeff ""the other white meat"" and kidding about the ""ff"" in Jeff's name calling him ""Jeff Fa fa"". Plugging Jeff's website Peanut is hysterical because his voice rises and falls and as many times as he plugs Jeff's website it's not annoying. Made me so curious that I visited the site.Walter is an obnoxious grouch and reminds me of my uncle which makes Walter funnier because people like Walter do exist. Walter says things no one would dare even for a 'real' old person.Melvin the Super Hero is refreshingly unsuperhero like because he's not perfect.Jose Jalapeno is cute and for a long time I couldn't figure out until I watched really close how his mouth moved. His accent is astonishingly real considering the fact that Jeff is American and to precisely mimic a Latino accent shows his unique gift of mimicry. I didn't like the routine of Jose Jalapeno being drilled by Peanut over being legal. Why? There's a difference between being current and making fun of it, and propagating the myth that if you're not legal, you don't belong here despite the justifications on the contrary by Jeff.But my all time favorite is Achmed the dead terrorist. He was hysterical when he mentioned his fear of Walter's farts busting the myth that the propagandized 'evil' terrorist fears nothing. His only problem is that he sounds East Indian instead of Middle Eastern. What I didn't appreciate was what I perceived as an Anti-Semitic joke which Mr. Dunham vehemently denies as racist when he made Achmed say he'd like to ""Kill the Jews"" by ""tossing a penny between two Jews and watching them fight to the death"" reinforcing the stereotypical myth that Jews fight over money which we don't and that such an act would be considered entertainment and telling Achmed that he doesn't use bigotry in his routines. Justifying the Anti-Semitic comment by Jeff's making Achmed say that he did the same joke but using two Catholic priests by throwing in a young boy was lame using priest molestations because no stereotypical racist comments about Catholicism as a religion was tossed in, making me wonder how Anti-Semitic Jeff Dunham may be while hiding behind his dummies. What I wonder about is what will happen to Achmed after we get over the propagandized fear over the 'evil' terrorist. He'll have no more material, forcing him to be relegated to nothing more, in Walter's words, as ""just a stinking Halloween ornament"". Despite his minor flaws, Achmed is a great character because he's given some 'humanity' and humor. The best joke about Achmed was that being all bone was nothing more than a ""flesh wound"".Alone, Jeff Dunham isn't funny at all with his beginning solo routine about his Blue Prius. I have no idea what that car looks like and it's reference as being a ""gay"" car because it's blue I found tasteless because once again it's poking fun in a stereotypical manner at another group of people who have enough problems with inaccurate judgements against them. Nor did I like his comments about his Chihuahua. I have one and they're great dogs and not to be maligned because they're small with big personalities.Overlooking the unfunny tries at stereotyping, Jeff Dunham is an amazing entertainer to watch. Being cute helps also.
