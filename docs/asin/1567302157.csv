184903,A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2,1567302157,"Daniel B. Waldman ""Film Guru""","[5, 6]","This movie is a variation on Kafka's &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; taken to even more absurd extremes.  It also took several cinematic &amp; thematic cues from Dali's &quot;Un Chien Andulou.&quot;  Both of those works, like  &quot;Sitcom&quot;, are about rebelling of what is often regarded as proper  or right in normal society.The rat, an unusual, off-beat pet in an  otherwise normal house, inspires the abnormal elements of the characters'  subconscious, causing them to act in the most bizarre fashion, beginning  with the son spontaneously announcing his homosexuality at the dinner  table, followed by his immediate seduction by the maid's husband, then the  inexplicable suicide attempt by the daughter.After that, the movie  gets wierd.Through all of the strangeness &amp; familial collapse the  father remains steadfast that absolutely nothing is wrong that everything  will come out all right in the end.  And then ultimately his fate is the  strangest of all.There are movies out there that demands that the  audience think about them, that in order to get something of satisfaction  they have to put some effort of imagination, of their own personality into  it, like a cinematic Rohrschach test (was that spelled right?).  This is  one of those movies.  Highly recommended for fans of the Avant Garde  cinema.",4,"Fascinating, grotesque and explicit",954460800,"03 31, 2000",2000,1319,"['movie', 'variation', 'Kafka', 'quot', 'Metamorphosis', 'quot', 'taken', 'even', 'more', 'absurd', 'extremes', 'also', 'took', 'several', 'cinematic', 'amp', 'thematic', 'cues', 'Dali', 'quot', 'Un', 'Chien', 'Andulou.', 'quot', 'works', 'quot', 'Sitcom', 'quot', 'are', 'rebelling', 'what', 'often', 'regarded', 'proper', 'right', 'normal', 'society.The', 'rat', 'unusual', 'off-beat', 'pet', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'house', 'abnormal', 'elements', 'characters', 'subconscious', 'causing', 'act', 'most', 'bizarre', 'fashion', 'beginning', 'son', 'spontaneously', 'announcing', 'homosexuality', 'dinner', 'table', 'followed', 'immediate', 'seduction', 'maid', 'husband', 'then', 'inexplicable', 'suicide', 'attempt', 'daughter.After', 'movie', 'strangeness', 'amp', 'familial', 'collapse', 'father', 'steadfast', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'everything', 'will', 'come', 'out', 'right', 'end', 'then', 'ultimately', 'fate', 'strangest', 'all.There', 'are', 'movies', 'there', 'audience', 'think', 'order', 'get', 'something', 'satisfaction', 'have', 'put', 'effort', 'imagination', 'own', 'personality', 'cinematic', 'Rohrschach', 'test', 'was', 'spelled', 'right', 'one', 'movies', 'Highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'Avant', 'Garde', 'cinema']",N/A

If you're reading my review of this item and know little else, devote yourself to my review -- it's best you know as little about the film as possible.Without giving away the story, I will tell you:  this is not your average ""sitcom"" --> it's a black comedy, the likes of which reminds me of Miike Takashi's ""Happiness of the Karakuris"" (probably a good bet if you've seen one, thinking about the other).  ""Sitcom"" does so many loopy, funny things with its normal French family (ha) that I was nearly jumping out of my seat going ""You'd never see that in an American film!""  ""No way!!!"" ""Oh brother!""  There are many gut-wrenching laughs to be had here.This film constantly defies our expectations, twist after twist.  On one level, it is very light, parodic fare; on another level, it says a lot of about our subconscious.Done on a minimal budget, it relies on brilliant characterizations, writing and direction.

184905,ACZ6J3L2C0IZ6,1567302157,"John Cardenas ""opera nut""","[2, 3]","This is an amusing, entertaining but not very deep gloss on suburban  decay.  The tables are turned on the buttoned down family in this movie.  When the respectable, staid father brings home a lab rat in a cage, it  becomes quite clear that the family members themselves are the guinea pigs.  The rat exerts a strange, hypnotic power:  these repressed suburbanites  toss their inhibitions to the wind and embrace their darkest, wildest  fantasies, be they erotic or morbid.  This premise certainly promises much,  and the filmmakers clearly owe a big debt to Bunuel and even Almodovar.  But the film lacks the obscene, sacrilegious kicks of the one and the  sultry, melodramatic absurdity of the other.  And the film is somewhat  wobbly in tone and structure; it has moments that promise revelation and  visual beauty but never quite delivers.  And when the father has his own  explosive epiphany, it hasn't the deadpan shock that Bunuel would have  given it.  The tone is listless, inert.  It's unclear at the end just what  the father represented that had to be destroyed:  patriarchal  repressiveness?  cold intellect?  hostility to animal impulse?  A far more  disturbing scene is the son's confrontation with his mother in bed.  I  found myself giggling surreptitiously to deflect the impact of this most  uncomfortable and blasphemous of Freudian scenarios.  This scene combines  horror and comedy in a way that the rest of the movie fails to live up  to--for once, we are drawn into the vortex where anxiety gives way to  irony.  Next to this scene, the rest of the film looks like trendy,  self-conscious posturing, as if the filmmakers thought themselves above the  real, unsettling content of their theme.",3,A shock and a giggle,960076800,"06 4, 2000",2000,1715,"['amusing', 'entertaining', 'not', 'very', 'deep', 'gloss', 'suburban', 'decay', 'tables', 'are', 'turned', 'buttoned', 'down', 'family', 'movie', 'When', 'respectable', 'staid', 'father', 'brings', 'home', 'lab', 'rat', 'cage', 'quite', 'clear', 'family', 'members', 'are', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'rat', 'strange', 'hypnotic', 'power', 'repressed', 'suburbanites', 'inhibitions', 'wind', 'embrace', 'darkest', 'wildest', 'fantasies', 'be', 'erotic', 'morbid', 'premise', 'certainly', 'much', 'filmmakers', 'clearly', 'owe', 'big', 'debt', 'Bunuel', 'even', 'Almodovar', 'film', 'obscene', 'sacrilegious', 'kicks', 'one', 'sultry', 'melodramatic', 'absurdity', 'other', 'film', 'somewhat', 'wobbly', 'tone', 'structure', 'moments', 'promise', 'revelation', 'visual', 'beauty', 'never', 'quite', 'delivers', 'when', 'father', 'own', 'explosive', 'epiphany', ""n't"", 'deadpan', 'shock', 'Bunuel', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'tone', 'listless', 'inert', 'unclear', 'end', 'just', 'what', 'father', 'represented', 'had', 'be', 'destroyed', 'patriarchal', 'repressiveness', 'cold', 'intellect', 'hostility', 'animal', 'impulse', 'far', 'more', 'disturbing', 'scene', 'son', 'confrontation', 'mother', 'bed', 'found', 'giggling', 'surreptitiously', 'deflect', 'impact', 'most', 'uncomfortable', 'blasphemous', 'Freudian', 'scenarios', 'scene', 'horror', 'comedy', 'way', 'rest', 'movie', 'live', 'up', 'once', 'are', 'drawn', 'vortex', 'where', 'anxiety', 'way', 'irony', 'Next', 'scene', 'rest', 'film', 'trendy', 'self-conscious', 'posturing', 'filmmakers', 'thought', 'real', 'unsettling', 'content', 'theme']",N/A

The head of the house brings home at rat. As a result, everyone including the maid, starts acting out their latent desires. S&M, suicide and incest are the rules of the day. Eventually the family realizes that they don't need the rat as they have all been liberated by it and are now free. It becomes apparent that Dad is the rat they need to get rid of. Who needs him? All he does is sit around and read the paper and allow everyone to do whatever they please.

Sitcom is a very clever movie indeed. This movie's humour lies on who should exist, the sexually 'normal'? or the sexually 'indecent'? The climax of the paterfamilias killing the whole family is followed by the anti-climax of the family killing the indifferent father figure. Are they killing the rat or their father?
