Growing up I just didnt belong to any group -I was never bullied or picked on, I think I was just not interesting enough for anyone to want to bother.  Had it not been for the X-Men series, and the action figures, I might have not survived.This was a great show that aired in the early 90s and survived for a few years, before (horribly) the show was cancelled. I thought I was going to die.  My whole world revolved around Professor Charles Xavier and his ""gifted"" students.  I wished, and prayed that I would develope sometype of ""mutant"" ability and at last have a reason for being so different.  Of course it never happened. But while other kids were drinking, smoking and commiting suicide I escaped reality by writing myself into the Marvel Universe sometimes as a member of the X-Men, but more often than not as a member of the brotherhood.X-Men is really a great metaphor for the Gay struggle.  I mean the cartoon really speaks about bigotry as a whole, but it is up to the individual to extract from this what they need.  I did and it did alot for me.  I cant explain it, but I will say without X-Men i doubt I would have survived High School, and I know I would not have finished College.  It is crazy and I really cant give a reason, but this series really introduced me to a world that was a great help in my growth and development. The lessons Xavier taught are really good ideas to use in reality.",5,This Was My Teenage Years,1283731200,"09 6, 2010",2010,1469,"['anyone', 'knew', 'anything', 'being', 'different', 'was', 'Growing', 'up', 'just', 'didnt', 'belong', 'group', '-I', 'was', 'never', 'bullied', 'picked', 'think', 'was', 'just', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'anyone', 'want', 'bother', 'Had', 'not', 'been', 'X-Men', 'series', 'action', 'figures', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'survived.This', 'was', 'great', 'show', 'aired', 'early', '90s', 'survived', 'few', 'years', 'horribly', 'show', 'was', 'cancelled', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'die', 'My', 'whole', 'world', 'revolved', 'Professor', 'Charles', 'Xavier', 'gifted', 'students', 'wished', 'prayed', 'would', 'develope', 'sometype', 'mutant', 'ability', 'last', 'have', 'reason', 'being', 'so', 'different', 'course', 'never', 'happened', 'other', 'kids', 'were', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'commiting', 'suicide', 'escaped', 'reality', 'writing', 'Marvel', 'Universe', 'sometimes', 'member', 'X-Men', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'member', 'brotherhood.X-Men', 'really', 'great', 'metaphor', 'Gay', 'struggle', 'mean', 'cartoon', 'really', 'about', 'bigotry', 'whole', 'individual', 'extract', 'what', 'need', 'did', 'did', 'alot', 'cant', 'explain', 'will', 'say', 'X-Men', 'i', 'doubt', 'would', 'have', 'survived', 'High', 'School', 'know', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'finished', 'College', 'crazy', 'really', 'cant', 'give', 'reason', 'series', 'really', 'introduced', 'world', 'was', 'great', 'help', 'growth', 'development', 'lessons', 'Xavier', 'taught', 'are', 'really', 'good', 'ideas', 'use', 'reality']",N/A

1328047,A1VF5LN6SHFVFJ,B0036EH3XY,"Darth Mortis ""Dark Lord of the Sith""","[0, 0]","After quite a wait, we finally have the fifth and final season of the 90's Animated X-Men show. I won't get too much into a detailed review as that has already been done, but I will explain my rating of 4 stars instead of 5.The season starts out with the intense Phalanx Covenant, which they do a decent job with. Unfortunately, after that, I don't think Season 5 is quite on par with the first 4 seasons. Matter of fact, this season's animation quality as well as storytelling, takes a drop in quality after Phalanx Covenant. Don't get me wrong, it's still a good season but there are issues.There is some questionable continuity. An example is that Jean Grey is alive and well in the beginning, then she is supposedly dead with no real explanation, then she is alive, then she's not around at all, then she reappears in the finale.Again, it's not too big of a deal, but they paid much more attention to detail in seasons 1-4 and kind of dropped the ball on 5. I also missed season 5 on TV so I didn't see it until this DVD set came out. I guess after years of waiting, I expected a bit more but it was still worthwhile.",4,Good But Not Up To Par With The Other Seasons,1277596800,"06 27, 2010",2010,1121,"['quite', 'wait', 'finally', 'have', 'fifth', 'final', 'season', '90', 'Animated', 'X-Men', 'show', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'too', 'much', 'detailed', 'review', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'will', 'explain', 'rating', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5.The', 'season', 'out', 'intense', 'Phalanx', 'Covenant', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'Unfortunately', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Season', '5', 'quite', 'par', 'first', '4', 'seasons', 'Matter', 'fact', 'season', 'animation', 'quality', 'as', 'well', 'storytelling', 'drop', 'quality', 'Phalanx', 'Covenant', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'still', 'good', 'season', 'are', 'questionable', 'continuity', 'example', 'Jean', 'Grey', 'alive', 'well', 'beginning', 'then', 'supposedly', 'dead', 'real', 'explanation', 'then', 'alive', 'then', 'not', 'around', 'then', 'finale.Again', 'not', 'too', 'big', 'deal', 'paid', 'much', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'seasons', '1-4', 'kind', 'dropped', 'ball', '5', 'also', 'missed', 'season', '5', 'TV', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'DVD', 'set', 'came', 'out', 'guess', 'years', 'waiting', 'expected', 'bit', 'more', 'was', 'still', 'worthwhile']",N/A
1328048,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0036EH3XY,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[2, 3]","For 46 years, the mutant superhero team known as ""X-Men"" have been a part of the lives of several generations. I personally grew up with the the X-Men during the latest 70's and early 80's but became interested once again during the early 90's when artist Jim Lee brought a new look and eventually created this incredible synergy amongst the fans. A time when Chris Claremont was ending his run and the storylines would be be infused by more excitement from Fabien Nicieza and Scot Lobdell.We were greeted with awesome storylines such as the ""The X-Tinction Agenda"", ""The Muir Island Saga"", ""X-Cutioner's Song"", ""Fatal Attractions"", ""Phalanx Covenant"" and ""Age of Apocalypse"" from 1990-1995 and in addition to the excitement in the comic books (which would continue on with the action figures from Toy Biz), the animated series was one of those special events that took place in October 1992 on the Fox Network.I can easily remember how many of my friends and fellow comic book collectors were excited for the series. Although not exactly the same type of storyline from the comic books, the animated series captured the heart and soul of the X-Men and ""X-Men: The Animated Series"" would continue on through 1998.Needless to say, the animated series is close to the heart for the diehard X-Men fan but also those who were young when the series came out, are now wanting to share the animated series with their own children. And for me, it's great to watch this series alongside my six-year-old son and seeing him enjoy the series as well.""X-MEN VOLUME 5' comes with the final 15 episodes of the animated series on two DVD's. It's important to note that Buena Vista Home Entertainment has the episodes going by how it was aired and not by production episode number. So, I will list the episodes with their episode # on the DVD but also their episode script #.Here is a brief, spoiler-less synopsis of ""X-MEN Volume 5 - Marvel DVD Comic Book Collection"":DISC: 1* EPISODE 63 (67) - The Phalanx Covenant (Part 1) - The techno-organic aliens known as the Phalanx attack life on Earth.* EPISODE 64 (68) - The Phalanx Covenant (Part 2) - The X-Men vs. the Phalanx.* EPISODE 65 (47) - A Deal with the Devil - Wolverine and Storm take on Omega Red.* EPISODE 66 (34) - No Mutant is an Island - After the aftermath of ""The Phoenix Saga"", Cyclops leaves the X-Men.* EPISODE 67 (36) - Longshot - The Inner Circle make their move and Professor X and Emma Frost battle against each other for psychic control of Jean. The Dark Phoenix is born.* EPISODE 68 (59) - Bloodlines - Nightcrawler receives a message that his mother is in trouble.DISC 2:* EPISODE 69 (69) - Storm Front (Part 1) - The alien Arkon asks for Storm to return with him to his planet and proposes to her.* EPISODE 70 (70) - Storm Front (Part 2) - Arkon and Storm are to be married but the X-Men find out that Arkon is not exactly on the side of good.* EPISODE 71 (72) - Jubilee's Fairy Tale Theatre - Jubilee leads a tour for several kids in a cave on mansion property but are caught in a cave-in.* EPISODE 72 (71) - The Fifth Horseman - Fabian Cortez kidnaps Jubilee.* EPISODE 73 (73) - Old Soldiers - A past story of when Wolverine and Captain America worked together back in World War II.* EPISODE 74 (75) - Descent - The origin of Mr. Sinister.* EPISODE 75 (74) - Hidden Agendas - Professor X takes in Sam Guthrie (Cannonball).* EPISODE 76 (76) - Graduation Day - It's the day of the Mutant/Human Relations Summit but Gyrich intends to make his presence known.VIDEO:""X-MEN"" the animated series is presented in full screen (1:33:1). One thing that you will notice is that the animation does show its age. Since the animation was created over 15-years ago, a lot of the animation is hand drawn and compared to many of the digital animated series that are show on television today, the animation doesn't have that digital color vibrancy as newer animations and also, you will notice that the animation does has its share of interlacing and on bigger television screens, viewers will notice edge enhancement as well.It's important to note that the final six episodes were animated by a different company.  As the animated series was supposed to end with season four's ""Beyond Good and Evil"", FOX ordered more episodes but the animators in Korea (AKOM) were already working on the second season of ""Fantastic Four"", the Philippine Animation Studio was brought in to complete the season.  Although not sure if anyone will be able to tell the difference.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:As for audio, audio is presented in Dolby 2.0 and is dialogue-driven (a French and Spanish language track is also included). Unfortunately, the soundtrack is front channel driven but for those who have receivers capable of a setting to enable stereo on all channels, I found that to be the best setting to enjoy the series on my home theater system.As for subtitles, ""X-MEN VOLUME 3' is provided in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are no special features included on both DVD's.JUDGMENT CALL:I was among the big X-Men fans who were highly anticipating the series and just loved it! As a collector of the X-Men comic books around that time period, to have a series based on Jim Lee's character designs and a series with so much potential of showcasing a variety of enemies and characters, it was always a treat to find out who would be introduced in each episode.In fact, during the hoopla and way before the Internet became part of our natural lives, many of the fans would communicate about the episodes through electronic BBS's and show our happiness and excitement over the animated series, the action figure line and of course the many multiple X-Men related comic book series that flourished from the early 90's.For volume 5, fans who were reading the comic books were also treated with the Phalanx storyline in animated format.  So, as an X-Man fan at the time, it was very cool to see something that was featured in a comic, appear so quickly in the cartoon.Now, there is one thing that is a big negative that hardcore fans of the animated series may find and that is the choice to feature the episodes via air date and not script #.For example, the majority of the episodes on this DVD are from season five but because of the production #, episodes from season three such as ""No Mutant is an Island"" (which is listed as episode #66 but on television it was episode #34) and ""Longshot"" (which is episode #67 was episode #36 on television) end up on this fifth DVD volume.  So, for continuity sakes, especially with ""No Mutant is an Island"" which comes after the ""Phoenix Saga"", there is continuity disruption which is a bit unfortunate.Granted, I know there are hardcore fans who really take issue of the episode listing on this DVD series but knowing how long fans have waited for the series and knowing what's done is done, this is probably the best we are going to get of the series in a long time (unless they remaster and restore it for a Blu-ray release in the future which I don't know if that will ever happen and because of the quality of the series, I kind of doubt it). So, with that being said, I still recommend the purchase of the series, especially if you have already purchased volume 1 through 4.Overall, ""X-MEN VOLUME 5' is an entertaining set and if you have started collecting the various volumes, you will definitely want to complete your collection with this fifth volume.For fans of the ""X-MEN"" animated series, despite the episode listing which is disconcerting for some, the episodes are still entertaining, nostalgic, action-packed and still enjoyable to watch over 15 years later and yes... for hardcore X-Men fans, still worth owning!",4,The

And it's unfortunate that the producers of this great series even decided to end it at all. No other subsequent X-Men series can hold a candle to this one. It's simply the best of all X-Men animated stories and it's even better than the live action movies. But did it go out with a bang? No. It's more like it fizzled. The two part Phalanx Covenant story was superb. It held the same quality as the earlier episodes, but soon thereafter it's like they knew they were done, so they stopped trying. Someone said they changed studios, had different artists, or something, but whatever they did differently, it suffered horribly as a result. By the last few episodes, the artwork was so bad, it's almost not worth watching. Gone was the majestic Disney-like quality of artwork that we saw in the Phoenix Saga, et al, and gone was the ambitious efforts we saw in the first four volumes, overall. Too bad. A great series fizzled out, not for lack of material, but for lack of caring.There's no excuse to sabotage a great series like that. And that's just what they did. And I know for sure, because the following is true: I was at the San Diego Comic Con just before the start of that final season, and I met the man in charge of Fox Kids Programming. I shook his hand and congratulated him on the greatness of the X-Men Animated Series, telling him that it was the best thing on television. He acted strangely, I thought at the time, even as we were shaking hands. Sheepishly, he thanked me, and then asked me what I thought about the Silver Surfer. I was baffled at that moment. Here I was telling him how great the X-Men cartoon was, and he's asking me what I thought of the Silver Surfer! I answered, ""He's all right, but the X-Men is the best thing on TV!""Anyway, as it turned out, that fifth season was the last season, (which I realize now, he knew that when we were talking,) and what was it replaced with? You guessed it. The Sliver Surfer, and it SUCKED. It sucked so bad, it didn't even last one full season! So there you have it. They sabotaged the X-Men to replace it with a poorly written Silver Surfer, which tanked.

And they can hear a slightly different version of the oh-so-cool theme song.Four episodes are two-parters (""The Phalanx Covenant"" and ""Storm Front""). The others are self-contained and their are quite a few gems. The challenge with a long running series is keeping the stories fresh and avoiding repetition and this collection is some of both. ""No Mutant is an Island"" focuses on the tormenting social and family issues of Nightcrawler. Being an outcast is at the core of being an X-Man or X-Woman.For changes of pace, look for Wolverine fighting in WWII with Captain America in ""Old Soldiers,"" or Jubilee telling a once-upon-a-time super story to children.The oddest episode is perhaps ""Descent,"" a Victorian era combination of Frankenstein, Jekyll & Hyde and...evolutionary theorism? Yes, an animated Charles Darwin has a guest role in this story about an experiment gone mad and resulting in lots of misunderstood mutants. it does not come as a total surprise to see him, since  the premise of X-Men is about mutation, genetics and socio-political dynamics, but imagine if he was on The Flintstones!

The creators never anticipated a fifth season and the contract with the animation studio even expired resulting in the last few episodes being animated by a new studio and a drastic change in visual style.  Some voice talent left as well, most notably Chris Potters who played Gambit and was replaced by Tony Daniels, making for a somewhat jarring presentation and conclusion.  A lot of the episodes are ""filler"" and stand-alone stories.  That doesn't mean they are bad, but the series always had a feeling of moving forward that is absent here.Nevertheless, if you've come this far you must see it through!  There are some good episodes here, even some classics, and the series did get a proper final episode which provides closure to the series.  Among the standout episodes are the two part Phalanx episodes which provide at least an entertaining team-up between Beast, Magneto, and Sinister.  I quite enjoy the episode ""Deliverance"" which gives us the back story of one of the villains of the series.  ""Old Soldiers"" is another flash back episode, this one featuring Wolverine and depicting his team-up with the legendary Captain America to take on the Red Skull.  ""Bloodlines"" brings back Nightcrawler and unveils his origins and relationship with Rogue and Creed.  We also get a couple holdover episodes, ""A Deal With the Devil"" and ""No Mutant is an Island,"" two episodes part of prior seasons that are presented here according to air date.  ""Fifth Horseman"" raises the question of whether Apocalypse is truly defeated and brings the often forgotten X-Factor member Caliban to the party.There are a few episodes I personally don't care for.  The two part ""Storm Front"" episode just doesn't do it for me, and the fact that is two parts is unfortunate.  The Cannonball episode is not well done and the new visual style just doesn't work here.  ""Jubilee's Fairytale Theater"" is definitely the black sheep of all the episodes.Despite a couple shortcomings this is still a must own.  The final episode is fun to watch, even if Xavier's illness is left mostly unexplained, its one of the few episodes where all of the X-Men get some facetime (and Jean is depicted in her comic book yellow and blue costume for the only time in the series, for those of you interested in that sort of thing).  Its unfortunate more time could not have been allotted for the conclusion, as it really would have benefitted as a multi-part arc give how quickly the Magneto conflict is resolved, but at least we get a final episode.  As a final piece of fan service, the original voice actor for Magneto, David Hemblen, was brought back for the last episode.

Had I appreciated what it had to offer, this and MMPR (the original) would have been the final crowning achievements of Saturday Mornings for me.An oddity in this package, however, has to do with the animation (particularly the character designs and especially on Disc 2). It's not so much a complaint as an observation that Jubilee, Gambit, Rogue, Storm, and the Professor look noticably different in the second half of the episodes of Season 5 and I just wonder if there were different artists working on these episodes than the rest of the series (particularly notable in ""Jubilee's Fairytale Theater"" and the ""Fifth Horseman of Apoccalypse"" but especially noticable in ""Graduation Day""). Anyway, it's just one of those questions that I would be interested in hearing an answer to (if, in fact, they used a completely different set of storyboard artists, resulting in altered character appearances).In speaking of ""Graduation Day""...honestly, I may have cried a bit myself at the end when an obviously dying Xavier was flown away without the satisfaction of seeing his dreams for a peaceful coexistence fulfilled. What a great and appropriate way to cap off the series though, as it was proven just how much all of these characters and their struggles meant to fans! Between ""Graduation Day"" and ""Old Soldiers"" (Captain America!), I have my favorite episodes of the fifth season.Alas, if my greatest regret was to not give this show the chance it deserved while I was young, I'm only glad that I had the opportunity to give this show the second chance that I did not regret giving it!

The mightiest group of super villians ever combined----The people who created season 5 of the show, thats who could defeat the x-men!!!  :(X-Men was my favorite cartoon series growing up.  I never got to see season 5 though.  So I went and bought all the seasons---even catching a few episodes I missed in the process......Lets just say seasons 1-4 are AWESOME!  When I got to season 5, I could not believe how bad this show ended.  If you actually think season 5 is any good, whatever it is you're smoking, please quit, brain cells are important.The episode ""Jubilee's Fairy Tale"" was the first X-Men episode I had to turn off!  I only made it 5 minutes into the show before I had to turn off the dvd player because IT IS THAT BAD.  The animation on season 5 is sooooo atrocious that when the characters are walking or running, they look like they are doing a fast ""waddle"" because they just took a major dump in their pants.....It was so hard to watch but I had to see how this series closed.  Even Beast's head looks like a marble on a giants body.  I thought having Captain America in an episode would be great----until I heard him speak---they had Sabretooth doing his voice over and it clearly DID NOT fit the character.Worst of all, in the episode ( I forget the title) where there is a kid who has super powers and he saves some people from a mine blast-----Rogue comes to help him----and she is not wearing her gloves----and she touches the kid a couple times during the episode and he does not fall into a coma!  LOL.  And Gambit tries breaking into a building, and instead of using his touch to charge up and blow off a vent cover, he uses a small explosive device instead----then he gets captured and cannot break free when his hands could easily charge the table/straps he is tied to and cause them to lightly explode so he could break free----and don't get me started on Gambits voice--LOL itsss sooo bad what they did to this series!I am going to keep seasons 1-4, but I'll be listing season 5 on ebay for 99 cents, I hope I can at least get that much from it.  Seasons 1-4 are my favorites and I will treasure them, but wow, I'd love to have been in a board room meeting with the people that were deciding to end the show like this.  The fans would have been better off NOT having a season 5 instead of how bad they ruined this show....Sorry if I made some grammar errors, I'm seriously ticked I wasted 15 bucks on this dung pile of a project.  The creators put no effort into this, even the begining theme song in season 5 is butchered with an awful electric guitar and they removed the introductions of the characters.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 2]","Marvel's 90s X-Men animated series comes to an end with this fifth DVD set from Disney, which contains the final episodes of the beloved series, which remains to this day the best Marvel animated series ever produced.  In these episodes, the X-Men face-off against a powerful alien force (""The Phalanx Covenant""), Omega Red returns with vengeance on his mind (""A Deal with the Devil""), Nightcrawler's past and family ties are revealed (""Bloodlines""), and Wolverine reminisces back to fighting alongside Captain America in World War II (""Old Soldiers"").  The best of the bunch here though are undoubtedly the two-parter ""Phalanx Covenant""; in which Beast and Forge form an unlikely alliance with Magneto and Mr. Sinister, ""Descent""; in which the origins of Mr. Sinister are explored, and the final episode ""Graduation Day""; which finds the X-Men uniting with Magneto in an effort to save the life of Professor Xavier.  Though the animation quality and voice work took a downward turn in some of these last episodes of the series, its overall message remained untouched.

1328068,A3TISHGXRLMTTV,B0036EH3XY,Patrick Correa,"[0, 0]","X_Men finally ends, & I have to admit, I really wish this show hadn't ended.  Really, with the comics still going, they could've been making good stories for another 5 seasons at least.  The only bad thing about this set is when Gambit's old voice actor leaves & we get a new one who doesn't sound very good, but he only does him for 3 episodes so it's bearable.  Here's a review of each episode, with synopsizes from Marvel Animation Age.63-64.  The Phalanx Covenant:  Rushing to investigate a disturbance downtown, the X-Men find Sabretooth on the rampage again, but realize too late that it isn't really Sabretooth at all.  It is the Phalanx, a voracious alien life-form that can assume the guise of anything or anyone.  Before long, the X-Men are all captured, except for Beast, who must find a way to stop the alien horror from devouring the entire Earth.  This is an excellent story, featuring the creepiest villains in the whole show.  They're so creepy that even Mr. Sinister teams up with Beast to stop them!  A+65.  Deal With the Devil:  The former Soviet Union's living weapon, Omega Red, is thawed out by the US Military to deal with an abandoned Soviet nuclear submarine near Hawaii.  He asks for his old enemy, Wolverine, and the woman responsible for freezing him most recently, Storm, to accompany him on the mission.  Omega Red is offered restored humanity, but once aboard the warhead-filled sub, he reveals his true, deadly intentions.  This isn't quite as good as the first Omega Red episode, but it's still great.  A66.  No Mutant Is an Island:  Still reeling from the traumatic events of the Phoenix Saga and Jean Grey's sacrifice, Cyclops quits the X-Men and travels back to the orphanage from where he was adopted as a child.  While there, Cyclops befriends some young mutants and fights to free them from the evil clutches of the Purple Man.  The infamous ""skipped episode"" is pretty good, even out of place.  I loved seeing the Purple Man on the small screen.  He was a villain in my favorite of the Marvel comics my father gave me.  B+67.  Longshot:  Longshot, a rebel from another world, tumbles into this world with no memory and a murderous gang led by the six-armed woman warrior Spiral hot on his trail.  It turns out that Longshot is on the run from Mojo, maniacal inter-dimensional TV executive.  Using Jubilee as the 'prize', Mojo and his minions lure Longshot and the X-Men into a deadly contest which Mojo broadcasts 'live' to up his ratings.  Again, I liked the first Mojo episode better but this was still great, as we get to see more of Longshot who is one of my favorite characters.  A68.  Bloodlines:  Nightcrawler gets a mysterious message that his estranged birth mother is in trouble.  He turns to the X-Men for assistance, but things get complicated when the X-Men realize the true identity of Nightcrawler's birth mother!  While nothing can quite compare to the first Nightcrawler episode this is still a high point of the series.  A+69-70.  Storm Front:  Arkon comes to Earth and begs Storm to return with him to his planet and save it from meteorological chaos. After much pleading, Storm agrees, but leaves a clue for the other X-Men to follow. The X-Men soon find out that Arkon's reasons may not be as simple as they first seem!  A great focus on Storm.  A71.  Jubilee's Fairy Tale Theatre:  Jubilee and a group of school children are caught in a cave-in while touring the X-Mansion property.  To keep the kids calm, Jubilee tells a medieval fairy tale of knights, princesses, trolls and dragons that strangely resemble some of her fellow X-Men.  This isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, but it could've been a lot better.  I did laugh some, but not enough.  The story this episode is based on was superior.  C72. The Fifth Horseman:  Apocalypse tasks Fabian Cortez with finding him a host body in order to escape the astral plane.  Appearing at the wrong place at the wrong time, Jubilee is kidnapped by Fabian Cortez and is taken to the temple for the ceremony.  This is one of the reasons the show should've continued.  A+73.  Old Soldiers:  Wolverine reminisces about his time in the service fighting alongside Captain America.  A scientist has been kidnapped by the Red Skull and the two heroes must team up to infiltrate a Nazi base to save his life!  I was jumping for joy when I caught this episode one Saturday morning.  I have to admit this show didn't do nearly enough crossovers, but at least it made each one excellent.  A+74.  Descent:  In London during England's Victorian era, two scientists, Dr. James Xavier and Dr. Nathaniel Essex, hotly debate Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection.  Essex believes mutants are the next genetic step forward and begins a bizarre experiment involving mutant evolution.  The origin of Mr. Sinister is revealed, as Dr. Xavier attempts to stop Essex before he goes too far.  This is a weird episode, but it's really well-done & reveals the origin of my favorite X-Men villain.  A75.  Hidden Agendas:  Professor Xavier receives a call for help from the parents of a new mutant, Sam Guthrie.  The X-Men travel down South to visit the new mutant and find that an Army official is planning on using Sam to do his bidding!  Aside from Rogue touching people without her gloves (was that so hard to animate?) this is a perfect episode.  A76.  Graduation Day:  At a Mutant/Human Relations Summit, Henry Peter Gyrich attacks and severely injures Professor Xavier with an energy disruptor.  Meanwhile Magneto makes final preparations to take over the world with his mutant army, but on the eve of the invasion Cyclops, Wolverine, and Jean Grey infiltrate Genosha to tell Magneto that Xavier is dying.  Magneto halts his plants out of respect to his long-time friend and joins the X-Men as they say farewell to their beloved mentor.  A fitting farewell for the show.  A+I honestly feel that this show is just as good as when it started.

The last episode was a heartfelt goodbye show.  I was hoping that it would continue in this format upon it's ending.  It's too bad that the X-Men never teamed up with the Avengers or Defenders to battle an adversary.  I wish that future shows would incorporate and acknowlege the other groups.  I do notice that very few of the Marvel shows don't guest star the Avengers.  It would bring more viewers and ratings into the fold if the producers had done so.  More than any of the other X-Men shows; this one consistantly kept the quality of the stories.,5,End of a Terrific Series,1273276800,"05 8, 2010",2010,679,"['What', 'show', 'apart', 'was', 'written', 'comics', 'mind', 'not', 'true', 'incarnations', 'X-Men', 'last', 'episode', 'was', 'heartfelt', 'goodbye', 'show', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'continue', 'format', 'ending', 'too', 'bad', 'X-Men', 'never', 'teamed', 'up', 'Avengers', 'Defenders', 'battle', 'adversary', 'wish', 'future', 'shows', 'would', 'incorporate', 'acknowlege', 'other', 'groups', 'do', 'notice', 'very', 'few', 'Marvel', 'shows', 'do', ""n't"", 'guest', 'star', 'Avengers', 'would', 'bring', 'more', 'viewers', 'ratings', 'fold', 'producers', 'had', 'done', 'so', 'More', 'other', 'X-Men', 'shows', 'one', 'consistantly', 'kept', 'quality', 'stories']",N/A

All I can say is thank God that Disney finished releasing this series and didn't leave us hanging. Containing all 13 episodes of the 5th season and one episode held over from the 3rd season this set contains the following fourteen episodes:The Phalanx Covenant (1) Aired: 9/7/1996Rushing to investigate a disturbance downtown, the X-Men find Sabretooth on the rampage again, but realize too late that it isn't really Sabretooth at all. It is the Phalanx, a voracious alien life-form that can assume the guise of anything or anyone.The Phalanx Covenant (2) Aired: 9/7/1996Beast and Forge search for allies to help them battle the alien threat. Gathering assistance from such unlikely sources as Magneto and Sinister, they embark upon a daring and risky plan to free the planet from the clutches of the Phalanx by traveling straight into the belly of the beast.A Deal with the Devil (Aired: 9/14/1996)The former Soviet Union's weapon, Omega Red, is thawed out by the US Military to deal with an abandoned Soviet nuclear submarine near Hawaii. He asks for his old enemy, Wolverine, and the woman responsible for freezing him, Storm, to accompany him on the mission. Omega Red is offered restored humanity, but once aboard the warhead-filled sub he reveals he may have other intentions.No Mutant is an Island (Aired: 9/21/1996)  [This episode is from the 3rd season]Following the loss of Jean Grey to the Phoenix Entity, Cyclops becomes disillusioned with the constant struggle between human and mutantkind. He quits the X-Men and returns to the orphanage he grew up in, discovering his old friend Sarah runs the place. She's helped by wealthy philanthropist Killgrave, who has been adopting orphaned mutant children. When Killgrave may be more than he seems can Cyclops overcome his grief in time to stop him?Longshot (Aired: 10/5/1996)Longshot, a rebel from another world, tumbles into this world with no memory and a murderous gang led by the six-armed warrior women Spiral hot on his trail. Longshot is on the run from Mojo, maniacal inter-dimensional TV executive. Using Jubilee as the prize, Mojo and his minions lure Longshot and the X-Men into a deadly contest which Mojo broadcasts 'live' to up his ratings.Bloodlines (Aired: 10/26/1996)Nightcrawler gets a mysterious message informing him that his birth mother (whom he never knew) is in trouble. He turns to the X-Men for help. Jubilee is baffled that Nightcrawler wants to help the mother who abandoned him -- she has never known her birth parents and feels hostile toward them. Nightcrawler admits there has been pain, but his faith in God has helped him overcome her rejection. The plot thickens when one of the team members recognizes Nightcrawler's mother's voice.Storm Front (1) Aired: 11/2/1996The dashing alien, Arkon, unleashes terrible weather conditions over Washington D.C. to get Storm's attention. He begs her to come to his planet, Corsus, to save it from meteorological chaos that threatens his people. Intrigued yet suspicious, Storm departs leaving a clue for the X-Men to follow. When the X-men arrive to 'rescue' Storm they find her proclaimed savior throughout Arkon's universe and Arkon asks her to marry him.Storm Front (2) Aired: 11/9/1996Spectacular preparations for Storm's wedding to Arkon proceed quickly. But as Jubilee helps Storm, the new queen, prepare for the wedding, Jubilee can't help notice how badly the palace workers are treated. Meanwhile Wolverine, Cyclops and Beast discover fleet ships bringing slaves from the neighboring planet. Back at the castle, Storm has been making a few discoveries of her own.Jubilee's Fairytale Theatre (Aired: 11/16/1996)Jubilee tells children her own fairy tale having herself, her fellow X-Men and their greatest enemies be the characters in it.The Fifth Horseman (Aired: 2/8/1997)Fabian Cortez helps Apocalypse escape from the astral plane.Old Soldiers (Aired: 2/22/1997)Wolverine thinks back to the time when he fought during World War II and teamed up with Captain America.Descent (Aired: 9/13/1997)The origin of Mr. Sinister is explored.Hidden Agendas (Aired: 9/6/1997)When the army learns of Sam Guthrie's cannonball power, they try to enlist him in their ranks.Graduation Day (Aired: 9/20/1997)Due to a serious injury, Professor Xavier is dying and must leave with Lilandra and go with her to the Shi'Ar Empire. He bids farewell to his X-Men. The last scene of this show ends with all of the X-men standing outside the mansion watching Lilandra's ship, carrying Xavier, flying away.A great collection of episodes to finish off the series. My favorites among them being No Mutant Is An Island, Bloodlines, Old Soldiers and Graduation Day. Some fans are upset that the episode No Mutant Is An Island, produced for season 3 (where the story would resonate more and make more sense chronologically), is being released on the 5th volume rather than the 3rd. Disney is releasing these episodes in the order they originally aired though and as long as I own them all it doesn't bother me too much.Audio and Video of the episodes isn't beautifully restored but they are in the same quality viewers will remember from when they originally aired. Some people have complained about minor compression issues but I'm fairly uptight and the quality of these episodes has never bothered me. Also these sets have yet to contain any special features other than previews for other Disney movies. This final volume will be no different so don't expect any sort of supplemental material. Despite the lack of special features I still give this 5th Volume 5 stars because this series is so great and because the packaging and original package art has been fantastic on all five.Now fans can own X-men the complete animated series in five volumes and have it look great on their shelf. Now lets hope good sales on these volumes will mean a possible complete series set with special features someday for more diehard fans like myself. I at least hope that good sales on these volumes will mean the release of other great series such as Spiderman the 90's animated series and/or possibly even convince Disney to release the remainder of the Gargoyles series on DVD. Anyways that's just me hoping.

Fox Kids had Eek the Cat, Bobby'sWorld, Tiny Toon Adventures, Animaniacs, X-Men, Spider-Man, The Tick and Mighty Morphing Power Rangers. Each one of memorableshows of the 90s. One of the most highly successful shows was the 90s X-Men.The final adventures of the highly successful X-Men animated series are now finally here.With this final volume, the entire series is now complete. We've waited long enough for thiswhole series. We can now rejoice as the series is now completed.This is the series' season four and five. X-Men debuted in 1992 on the Fox Kids network and ran all the way to 1997 withfive seasons and a total of 76 episodes. In this season, we'll witness Omega Red teaming with the X-Men,an alien species consuming the planet, Storm being engaged to a king from another world, the origins ofMr.Sinister and Wolverine teaming up with Captain America to battle the Red Skull. We'll even witness the finalepisode with emotional results as Xavier leaves the X-Men to survive a fatal illness.If you are either a fan of X-Men, Marvel, Fox Kids' cartoons, 80s/90s cartoons or just love all in general, then don't miss the final adventures of X-Men. If you loved volumes one two, three and four, then don't miss the final volume. It might just bea great time to gather all volumes and witness the 90s all over again.Also the Iron Man 90s animated series is being released along with X-Men. Let's just hope that someday, Disney will somedayreleased the 90s Spider-Man, along with Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends, Silver Surfer and all other Marvel series. I wouldlove to have the 94 Spider-Man get a DVD release. I also hope that they'll release Eek the Cat and the rest of Gargoyles and the Tick on DVD.Here's the episode in this volume:The Phalanx Convient, Part 1:While pursing Sabertooth, the X-Men's mansion is taken over by an matter consuming entity known as The Phalanx.Beast meets an alien being named Warlock who offers to help.The Phalanx Convient, Part 2:Beast, Warlock, Mr. Sinister and Forge recruit Magneto to help them stop The Phalanx from taking over the world.A Deal With The Devil:Wolverine and Storm are summoned to 'assist' Omega Red in finding an active nuclear submarine.

But it wasn't in that volume.In this episode, Cyclops leaves The X-Men and returns to the orphanage where he was raised.
