And it's a good thing for 'RV' that Robin Williams is in the driver's seat.  If not we'd have to put up with more than ""Are we there, yet?"" from his two bratty teenage kids, even if his wife, Jamie (Cheryl Hines), is a sweet, yet nagging presence.Bob Munro (Williams) is a successful corporate figure, and, as in many similar movies, he must juggle his career and his responsibilities as a father.  Like many families he has plenty of money, but none of the needed time to engage with his family.  His boss is a real charmer:  Todd tells his wife that ""If my ex-wife were as good looking as you, I'd still be in a horrible marriage.""  Poetic justic, I guess, is rendered when an equally charming friend of teenage Cassie douses the corporate jerk-face and gives him a good lecture like she were the head of the health police.Bob wants to keep his promise for a Hawaiian vacation, but Todd the Boss insists he make up for the debacle.  So he sends Bob to Boulder for a sales pitch to make a local soda pop acquisition with a corporate merger.  Bob's solution?  Get an RV and combine family time with a business trip.  We have all the jokes you'd might expect:  Bob hasn't gotten his RV license--figuratively--and runs over and into anything.  Then taste comes into question when nearly every conceivable joke could be made about waste management.  It is at such a dumping site that the Munros meet the Gornickes.  Culture clash meets the Monroes as the clueless city slickers meet the corny country couple with their own two kids.  Stereotypes are made and broken.  First they're made so we can laugh; then they're broken, so the producers don't get hate mail.  On the road again, the Munros try everything to evade the Gornickes' family charm, which seems inconceivable.  Teen daughter Cassie sums it up best when she says, ""What do they like about us?  We're not even that appealing!""  True enough, Cass.  All too many predictable mishaps derail Bob's chances of making a timely pitch to charm client and family.  In a final desperate attempt to get back to the camp site after his sales pitch, he is stuck in a high altitude traffic jam.  Bob has all the sense (and nonsense) to take the alternate route, Diablo Pass, to meet his family in a timely fashion.  Only to be taken by jeep or a dirt bike, the conceivable ""condo on wheels"" has only one place to go on this terrain, and it ends up in a mountain lake.There will be enough interest and appeal to satisfy some fans for this movie.  Williams gets nearly all the big laughs.  (""If I lose my job, I hope the kids love selling fruit on the highway."")  Jeff Daniels country charms us with the veneer of a 'Dumb and Dumber' persona.  The Gornicke singing, which is meant to make us laugh with the Mrs.'s country yodeling, is really one of the more endearing elements of the movie.  Nay, the generous, well-behaved presence of the Texas family helps to soften the rougher edges of Munro kids needing some quality time. And the heart to heart talks between man and son and man and wife bolster some needed emotion in what is too often an overly long and irritating trek to the mountains.

999532,ATDE9JYCPI0L1,B000G8O0MK,Alyssa A. Lappen,"[0, 0]","Don't see Barry Sonnefield's latest production, RV, unless you enjoy slapstick comedy, the kind that dominates Laurel and Hardy and Marx Brothers films.Please note: Many slapstick comedy plots are pretty stupid. Their characters are also often dumb or revolting, or both. But the ultimate point of slapstick humor is to make people laugh. And if you like to laugh, this is a great film. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard, or so much.Here, Bob Munro (Robbin Williams) is a white collar slave to a nasty, political boss who likes playing employees off against one another. At the moment, his job is at risk. So when his boss orders him to cancel his family vacation to Hawaii, he rents a giant RV to take them to Colorado instead--without mentioning to his family that he has to come up with a presentation for his company's potential buyers, or else.No, he tells them his wife Jamie (Cheryl Hines), 16-year-old daughter Cassie (JoJo) and son Carl (Hutcherson) that they don't spend enough time together, and that a camping trip terminating at gorgeous campsites in Colorado will be just the ticket. In the end, it is indeed, and not only in the way that Munro had suggested.Predictably, the moment that the family boards the RV (with a huge ""Rent Me"" sign painted on its side), things start to go wrong. But not all the jokes--including some crude, teenage toilet humor--are predictable, and they are often hysterical.En route to the unmentioned corporate meeting, the Munros encounter the overly friendly, somewhat overbearing Gornicke family--Travis (Jeff Daniels), Marie Jo (Kristin Chenoweth) and their kids Earl (Hunter Parrish), Billy (Alex Ferris) and Moon (Chloe Sonnenfeld), whom they are continuously trying to escape. As luck (and slapstick) would have it, the Gornickes regularly show up again just when the one or more of the Munros find themselves in a pickle.The slapstick gags all involve predictable turns of the plot--running the RV sewage line, a lost laptop (actually, stolen), Bob's inability to transmit his presentation, a wild pack of raccoons, a near-catastrophic drive on a mountain road, and so on--but the film includes some very important, and surprisingly touching messages about the importance of family, friends and meaningful work. And once again, ladies, gents and kids, this movie is meant for laughs. And it's very funny, teenage humor and all.--Alyssa A.

Williams plays a busy executive trying to close a big deal who's family is insisting on a vacation to Hawaii. So, he decides to rent an RV and take the family on a cross-country road-trip. On their journey, they meet a kinda crazy family (country hick) who keeps following them. This is a funny movie that nicely balances Williams insane comedy with a pretty well done script/story. Williams plays it pretty rationally but retains his outstanding comedy contents and timing. There are many great lines and scenes. My favorite set of scenes was at the RV waste pump-out station; another favorite was the RV atop the mountain suspended in mid-air by the mountain point. So why only 3 of 5? I have seen many movies that are much funnier than this with more insane situations. So, 3 of 5 for this well done good comedy movie.

999539,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000G8O0MK,Andrew Ellington,"[4, 5]","I must admit that `RV' is much better than many give it credit for.  Sure, it's not the most ingenious comedy to hit the theater but it sure is funny.  There is an influx of no brain comedies filling the local video store these days, but `RV' is different.  It's witty, funny, charming and wholesome, which is something that can't be said for many films these days.  You can actually watch this one with the whole family and not once have to cover any eyes or plug any ears or squirm in discomfort.The film revolves around businessman Bob Munro who is planning on taking his family to Hawaii for vacation (such a clich&eacute;d vacation destination) until his boss springs an important meeting on him.  So, in order to make the meeting, he changes his vacation to a cross country road trip to Colorado complete with a rented RV.  His family is of course devastated and against the trip from the very beginning, but Bob talks it up as a way for them to really connect with one another on a deeper level then they do at present.  The vacation proves to be quite the culture shock for them but also quite the bonding experience.  When Bob's true intentions are uncovered though it puts a strain on the wonderful relationship his family was forming.Robin Williams is at the top of his physical humor here with one slapstick scene after another.  Cheryl Hines lends some major support in the quick witted department, and while not necessarily funny both JoJo and Josh Hutcherson deliver believable performances as the Munro children.  Scene stealing rights though belong to Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth who, along with Hunter Parrish, Chloe Sonnerfeld and Alex Farris, play one of the strangest and funniest families you'll ever meet.In the end `RV' has a message about the importance of family, and it is sweet and endearing.  Most importantly though is the fact that `RV' is quite the riot.  It's good clean fun that takes advantage of its stars comedic range and nails gag after gag.  Sure, it's not the most inspired comedy out there and it surely isn't the best but for what it is it really hits the mark.  It may be predictable and a little unoriginal but it plays to its strengths and delivers non-the-less.

999543,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B000G8O0MK,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 2]","Many of us have been wanting Robin Williams to get back to doing funny movies like ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" or ""The Birdcage"", and we got our wish. Unfortunatley, it was a film that was all too short on the comedy side. ""RV"" is the kind of movie you will instantly recognize because you have seen it a hundred million times before. If you have not read or heard what the movie was about in advance, or had not seen any of the trailers, you will instantly know what the movie is about and how everything will happen and what will occur in the outcome the moment you start watching it. Robin Williams plays family man Bob Munro, who decides to take his family on a road trip in an ugly RV. The fam consists of wife(Cheryl Hines of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm""), daughter(Singer JoJo), and son(Josh Hutcherson). What the family doesn't know is that this family bonding trip also includes Bob trying to work on his job and save it at the same time. Along the way they meet the Gornicke family, headed by Jeff Daniels and Broadway star Kristin Chenoweth, who are a happy family who have no qualms of breaking out the banjo. They are the best part of the movie. There may be a few laughs here and there, but they are too far apart. The movie is mostly one incident or manic chaos after the other that you can see coming a mile away. Even Williams is a little subdued here when his manic craziness would of livened up the proceedings. Cheryl Hines has proven herself to be more than capable of top shelf comedy, but she mostly gets bogged down with the typical wife role here and really has nothing else to do than go thru the motions of being on a bad road trip with a husband you are having problems with. What we get here folks is the usual bodily excrement scene, a battle with wild outdoor creatures, and a man trying to keep his family together. To be honest, the father/daughter aspect of the film was quite touching and actually worked rather well. The different dynamic between the sweet and loving relationship between dad and daughter when she was younger was a nice contrast to the annoyed teenager we see in the entire movie. That was the one part of that fammily's story that I thought was rather warm and human and was well done the most. The father lying to his family and trying to keep them together for the greater good was pretty cliched and has been done better in other films. Director Barry Sonnenfeld(that's him on the side of the RV)has had a decent track record(The Addams Family, Get Shorty, Men In Black), but he can't raise the film high enough to hit the mark. As I already mentioned, the Gornicke family are the best part of the film. You can't help but smile and enjoy the goofiness of tall Jeff Daniels and perky, buxom Chenoweth continuing to have smiles on their faces as they sang a good 'ol hootenany. When the film is over, you realize that the entire movie should of been about them. Sorry Robin, and I hope the rumored news of a Doubtfire 2 are true.

Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[0, 1]","Mindless comedies abound in our A-D-D afflicted society, and it appears there is no end in sight for this overly worn-out genre when it comes to cinema.Some may remember THE LONG, LONG TRAILER (a Desi and Lucille Ball 1954 film based loosely on The Lucille Ball show), but it's more likely that the current generation will be familiar with NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION or (ugh!) EUROPEAN VACATION, both starring Chevy Chase. The focus of these was on family and how vacations affect individual members in often funny ways. Sometimes they hit their mark, and sometimes not. But RV fails to even form a target.Where RV lets us down is in ...well ...every department save one (and only minimally there). Its soggy plot, tepid characters, and discouraging script will most likely ruin it for most. But the biggest let down is that the comedy just isn't that funny. What's more, most laughs come thanks to the RV itself rather than from any characters' interactions with other characters (which is where National Lampoon's Vacation succeeded).The story is about the Munro family and how distant their lives are from each other as the kids grow into their teens, and the husband and wife lead separate lives thanks to jobs and the demands of home-life. Bob Munro (Robin Williams, GOOD WILL HUNTING) is the patriarch with a demanding boss. He's forced to cancel his family's Hawaiian vacation to finish a job and instead of telling his family the truth, lies to them (for fear of being alienated even more) and exclaims that they're going to take a California to Colorado trek in an RV (where Bob's supposed to give a presentation). His wife Jamie (Cheryl Hines, CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM TV series) grudgingly goes along for the ride. His kids Cassie (Joanna `JoJo' Levesque, AQUAMARINE) and Carl (Josh Hutcherson, ZATHURA) are forced to come along, too, and vent all of their frustrations on Dad. To add further fuel to this volatile mix, they immediately run into the Gornicke family lead by Travis (Jeff Daniels, THE SQUID AND THE WHALE), a gypsyish RV clan desperate for friendship. They latch onto Bob and his kin, and never let go.As the story progresses, we learn that the RV is a character in itself. With a faulty parking brake, it continually breaks loose from its moorings and rolls into trouble (from shopping carts to crumpling over police cars ...probably the funniest moment of the entire movie and it comes at the extreme end of the film). As Bob closes in on his presentation date, he digs a pit of lies under his family in order to keep them in the dark as to his real reasons for going RVing. And once the truth comes out, the family falls into chaos only to be saved by cliche and a putrid made-for-TV ending (""We understand now, Dad!"").So there you go. Just too few laugh-out-loud moments and a transparent family drama that'll make you nauseous. Too bad considering this was supposed to be a feel-good comedy. It's not that comedic, and you certainly won't feel good after watching it.",2,Don't Travel This Road...,1161475200,"10 22, 2006",2006,2995,"['Mindless', 'comedies', 'abound', 'A-D-D', 'afflicted', 'society', 'end', 'sight', 'overly', 'worn-out', 'genre', 'when', 'cinema.Some', 'may', 'remember', 'THE', 'LONG', 'LONG', 'TRAILER', 'Desi', 'Lucille', 'Ball', '1954', 'film', 'based', 'loosely', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'show', 'more', 'likely', 'current', 'generation', 'will', 'be', 'familiar', 'NATIONAL', 'LAMPOON', 'VACATION', 'EUROPEAN', 'VACATION', 'starring', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'focus', 'was', 'family', 'how', 'vacations', 'affect', 'individual', 'members', 'often', 'funny', 'ways', 'Sometimes', 'hit', 'mark', 'sometimes', 'not', 'RV', 'even', 'form', 'target.Where', 'RV', 'down', 'well', 'department', 'save', 'one', 'only', 'minimally', 'there', 'soggy', 'plot', 'tepid', 'characters', 'discouraging', 'script', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'ruin', 'most', 'biggest', 'let', 'down', 'comedy', 'just', ""n't"", 'funny', 'What', 'more', 'most', 'laughs', 'come', 'thanks', 'RV', 'rather', 'characters', 'interactions', 'other', 'characters', 'where', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'succeeded', '.The', 'story', 'Munro', 'family', 'how', 'distant', 'lives', 'are', 'other', 'kids', 'grow', 'teens', 'husband', 'wife', 'lead', 'separate', 'thanks', 'jobs', 'demands', 'home-life', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'GOOD', 'WILL', 'HUNTING', 'patriarch', 'demanding', 'boss', 'forced', 'cancel', 'family', 'Hawaiian', 'vacation', 'finish', 'job', 'instead', 'telling', 'family', 'truth', 'fear', 'being', 'alienated', 'even', 'more', ""'re"", 'going', 'take', 'California', 'Colorado', 'trek', 'RV', 'where', 'Bob', 'supposed', 'give', 'presentation', 'wife', 'Jamie', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'CURB', 'YOUR', 'ENTHUSIASM', 'TV', 'series', 'grudgingly', 'ride', 'kids', 'Cassie', 'Joanna', 'JoJo', 'Levesque', 'AQUAMARINE', 'Carl', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'ZATHURA', 'are', 'forced', 'come', 'along', 'too', 'vent', 'frustrations', 'Dad', 'add', 'further', 'fuel', 'volatile', 'mix', 'immediately', 'run', 'Gornicke', 'family', 'lead', 'Travis', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'THE', 'SQUID', 'AND', 'THE', 'WHALE', 'gypsyish', 'RV', 'clan', 'desperate', 'friendship', 'latch', 'Bob', 'kin', 'never', 'let', 'go.As', 'story', 'learn', 'RV', 'character', 'faulty', 'parking', 'brake', 'continually', 'loose', 'moorings', 'rolls', 'trouble', 'shopping', 'carts', 'crumpling', 'over', 'police', 'cars', 'probably', 'funniest', 'moment', 'entire', 'movie', 'extreme', 'end', 'film', 'Bob', 'presentation', 'date', 'pit', 'lies', 'family', 'order', 'keep', 'dark', 'real', 'reasons', 'going', 'RVing', 'once', 'truth', 'out', 'family', 'chaos', 'only', 'be', 'saved', 'cliche', 'putrid', 'made-for-TV', 'ending', 'understand', 'now', 'Dad', '.So', 'go', 'Just', 'too', 'few', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'transparent', 'family', 'drama', ""'ll"", 'make', 'nauseous', 'Too', 'bad', 'considering', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'feel-good', 'comedy', 'not', 'comedic', 'certainly', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'good', 'watching']",N/A

He is my favorite actor of all time. Until today, I had something special regarding Robin Williams, but ""R.V."" changed history for me. Today, on Cinco de Mayo of 2006, history has been changed for me. ""R.V."" is now my favorite movie featuring Robin Williams and, what is more, my favorite Comedy! In second place for my favorite Comedy now is ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" featuring John Candy and Steve Martin. First off, ""R.V."" was gathering many people in the big house today. A crowd of over 150 people were in its second showing today. I did not know what to expect, but oh my God, I was laughing so extremely hard (as was the other over 150 people), that I had to literally gasp for air. No, 911 was not called, but if I were at home, it might have been. You see, at the big house I try to be as quiet as possible, even when I am laughing. All I have to say now is, you will adore (not love, but adore) this movie if you like Robin Williams and/or Jeff Daniels, or if you just plain like Comedy for Comedy's sake. Either way, make sure that you do whatever you have to to see this movie.

999558,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B000G8O0MK,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 5]","Only a director as shameless as Barry Sonnenfeld would put his face on the side of an oversized, tacky RV as a way to star in his own movie. He does exactly that in ""RV,"" a family comedy that, surprisingly, isn't overbearing or pretentious. I have to admit; the ads had me a little worried, considering they showed Robin Williams hanging on for dear life to the windshield of the runaway vehicular behemoth. They also showed him trying to empty an overflowing sewage tank (and believe me when I say that the results are disastrous). When edited together in a trailer, those kinds of moments would naturally lead one to believe that this is nothing more than a shallow slapstick farce, unhindered by meaningful character development or relevant messages.But there's a deeper idea hidden beneath the physical comedy, and while it may come off as sappy, it's ultimately something that a lot of people need to be aware of. Basically, it's a story about coming together as a family in the midst of unwanted circumstances and difficult obstacles. Family togetherness seems to be a problem for Bob Munro (Robin Williams) and his family: he works too hard for a soda company; his wife, Jamie (Cheryl Hines), is overloaded with the stress of being a stay at home mom; and his kids, Cassie (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) and Carl (Josh Hutcherson) have emotionally distanced themselves. This is especially true of Cassie; in the opening scene, she's a sweet, loving five- or six-year-old, and at that time, she and her father were best friends. Now she's an angry teen, constantly complaining about him and the decisions he makes (anyone who lives with a teen will know exactly what I'm talking about). Carl is overly sensitive about being short and underweight, something he tries to counteract by continuously lifting weights.The Munro's had planned to go on vacation to Hawaii, which, not surprisingly, everyone was looking forward to. Then from out of the blue, Bob's boss, Todd (Will Arnett), says that Bob needs to cancel his trip and go to Colorado to speak on behalf of their company; a merger with another company is imminent, and he's the best at negotiating. Not wanting to disappoint his family by the fact that he needs to continue working, he decides to bring everyone with him in an RV. And what better way to fool them than to disguise the trip as an opportunity to vacation at a lake in the Colorado Rockies?Of course, Jamie and the kids are not at all thrilled with this idea, and they certainly waste no time in expressing their discontentment to Bob. Nothing he does is ever correct, and his ideas for family entertainment are considered pathetic. The fact that none of them enjoy camping only makes things worse, creating tension so thick it could be cut with a knife; at one point, Jamie, Cassie, and Carl put on headphones and sing aloud in an attempt to drown out the other person's music. It doesn't help that the RV itself is structurally and mechanically handicapped, continuously breaking loose of it's parking break and rolling backwards (and more often than not, something is damaged).Things continue to go downhill when they spend the night at an RV camp and meet the Gornicke family, a close-knit unit led by Travis (Jeff Daniels) and Marie Jo (Kristin Chenoweth). Sure, they're a nice enough group of people, and they're certainly accommodating and happy to make new friends. But their general demeanor is more than a little irritating, especially since they throw makeshift Country/Western concerts at the drop of a hat, with their children, Earl (Hunter Parrish), Moon (Chloe Sonnenfeld), and Billy (Alex Farris) acting as backup singers. Their RV has a novelty horn that blares the ""Star Trek"" theme when honked, as well (which effectively and humorously acts as a warning signal throughout the movie, seeing as the Munro's can't seem to avoid them no matter where they go).Thus sets into motion the adventure awaiting them all, filled with enough mishaps to satisfy the family comedy enthusiast in us all (and I know we all have one; some are just more pronounced than others). They range in extremes from a pack of ill-tempered raccoons to the theft of Bob's laptop computer, something he needs if he's to type his report and e-mail it to his boss in a timely fashion.What makes that particular situation more interesting is that he has to do it secretly if he wants to keep his family from knowing the real reason for this trip. This forces the audience to rethink their opinion of him: yes, he does long to get closer to his family, but does the fact that he lied to them about the trip make it all meaningless? It's good to see that some movies--even those geared towards the whole family--bring up issues like this since the everyday person is not so one-dimensional. Everyone has good points and bad points, and to some extent, ""RV"" brings that to light. This is especially true of the Gornicke's; they do have redeeming qualities despite their presence being like fingernails on a chalkboard.But don't get the idea that this movie gets overly sentimental. There are still a fair number of blatantly stereotypical characters, all of which serve as mere comedy relief, included as a way to lighten the moment and ease the tension. We have a group of campers who try to help Bob connect a hose to his RV's sewage tank, and each one of them is a Hillbilly with a capital H. We also have Todd representing the Evil Boss character, someone who's inflexible, patronizing, and manipulative. I suppose it can be argued that some characters are negatively portrayed, and at times I worried that certain ideas would go too far. But I kept reminding myself that milder comedies need a little room for exaggeration, and you should keep that in mind when watching this, as well. What's even better is that, ultimately, nothing goes over the top, not even an exploding sewage hose and the disgusting aftermath. ""RV"" knew just when to step away and cut the audience some slack before attempting another joke, and the fact that the filmmakers paid attention to this impressed me.This is a perfectly acceptable movie to take the kids to, especially since it reinforces the importance of family, love, and respect. It's not just a concoction of ridiculous physical gags like the commercials make it seem; in reality, it's light and entertaining, and it gives a serious message without getting too sappy about it. It's a well-balanced film, much like the Munro's RV was as it swung like a seesaw on a protruding rock (represented in the comically exaggerated poster). That's a good thing for a family comedy; more often then not, they're completely overloaded with unnecessary slapstick routines that only children would appreciate. More family comedies need to be written like ""RV"" was. At least then the kids won't be the only ones leaving the theater feeling happy.",4,The Road Trip Diaries,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,6876,"['Only', 'director', 'as', 'shameless', 'Barry',

999562,ASU5IH3CM6XXE,B000G8O0MK,ChrisTyrrell,"[3, 3]","OK, first of all, has Robin Williams ever made a bad movie?  I don't think so, except Dead Poets Society and Awakenings which were the least funny of his movies, but some people like those.  Which just goes to show that even his stinkers are beloved.This movie has a fresh concept about a family travelling around in an RV and the ensuing hijinks that ensue.  Robin Williams is really funny in all the funny parts he has, and he definitely has a comic timing that people cannot and should not ignore.  I'm not a fan of slapstick movies like Dumb & Dumber and the Three Stooges, and one of the Merchant/Ivory productions, which is why I really gravitate towards RV.  It is about learning, and growing, and feeling, and loving, and family, and God, and recreational vehicles, and only some farting jokes.  It's totally witty and thought-inducing like a play by Voltaire or something, and that's why I think it's what I like to call ""smart comedy.""The girl from Curb Your Enthusiasm is good in this movie too and I bet she ad-libbed all of her lines because she's great at that.  So is Robin Williams.  He must be hilarious to be around, because he's probably always making classic jokes about priests, and doing his ""urban voice"" or his preacher voice, or his southern voice.  And he can make anything funny.  He could read the phone book (in his southern preacher voice) and make it sound like a joke book instead of a list of phone numbers.  Man, I love Robin Williams.Also I would say that the titular RV is so great that it's basically like a third character all of its own, although I don't think it should branch out into dramas.  Just kidding, I know it's just an inanimated object.  My joke was lame.

""Constantinos V.""","[1, 3]",A great perfomance by Robin Williams who has mastered comedy and he is funny in such a natural way.You might have not driven an RV but maybe you have used a truck to move houses and right there you can relate when he starts dirving this huge vehicle. This was the first time I really laughed and it was as if I was watching myself driving.It is also entairtaining to see how Robin Williams is trying to balance between his responsibilities as a family man and as a sales person for his company. It seems that he makes it at the end. It is a movie that one way or the other you can relate with what is going on although in such an exagerated way that causes a lot of laughter. Not to overlook the family from Texas that seems to be almost stalking Robin Williams and his family but prove to be so nice and helpful (on the score board Texas once more.)I highly recommend this movie as family entertainment and for some hearty laughters.,5,You will laugh until you have tears in your eyes,1159920000,"10 4, 2006",2006,934,"['great', 'perfomance', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'mastered', 'comedy', 'funny', 'natural', 'way.You', 'might', 'have', 'not', 'driven', 'RV', 'maybe', 'have', 'used', 'truck', 'move', 'houses', 'right', 'can', 'relate', 'when', 'dirving', 'huge', 'vehicle', 'was', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'laughed', 'was', 'was', 'watching', 'driving.It', 'also', 'entairtaining', 'see', 'how', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'trying', 'balance', 'responsibilities', 'family', 'man', 'sales', 'person', 'company', 'end', 'movie', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'can', 'relate', 'what', 'going', 'such', 'exagerated', 'way', 'lot', 'laughter', 'Not', 'overlook', 'family', 'Texas', 'be', 'almost', 'stalking', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'family', 'prove', 'be', 'so', 'nice', 'helpful', 'score', 'board', 'Texas', 'once', 'more', 'highly', 'recommend', 'movie', 'family', 'entertainment', 'hearty', 'laughters']",N/A

You can always rely of Robin Williams for that.  No, it's not the smartest comedy but it's not like we thought we were walking into 'Fargo' people, we were walking into a family vacation comedy that's full of slapstick laughs and gross humor, and that should be what you expected.  Robin Williams plays Bob, a man whose a slave to his job, a job he's afraid he may lose.  He's so afraid that he actually cancels his family's vacation to Hawaii and takes them on an RV trip to Colorado with hopes to sneak off to a meeting with his germaphobe boss in order to keep his job.  Along the way (of course keeping his true intentions secret) he tries to recreate the bond he once had with his family.  This of course starts of shakey since neither his wife (Cheryl Hines) nor his children, teenage daughter Cassie (JoJo) whose going through her rebelous ""i hate mommy and daddy"" stage and his young son Carl (Josh Hutcherson) whose insecure about his small size, are supportive.  But after all the problems with sewage, weird hillbilly RV neighbors the Gornicke family (led by Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth) and some pesky racoons their is a family bonding moment that is shattered by a bowel problem (sort-of) a sinking RV and the exposure of Bob's secret meeting.  In the end, RV may be predictable family fun, but the point still remains that it's family fun, and that's gotta amount to something.",5,"""I've got my ferns...""",1153180800,"07 18, 2006",2006,1560,"['Okay', 'actually', 'loved', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'entertaining', 'just', 'what', 'needed', 'see', 'something', 'pointless', 'yet', 'trick', 'perfectly', 'can', 'always', 'rely', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'No', 'not', 'smartest', 'comedy', 'not', 'thought', 'were', 'walking', ""'Fargo"", 'people', 'were', 'walking', 'family', 'vacation', 'comedy', 'full', 'slapstick', 'laughs', 'gross', 'humor', 'should', 'be', 'what', 'expected', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Bob', 'man', 'slave', 'job', 'job', 'afraid', 'may', 'lose', 'so', 'afraid', 'actually', 'family', 'vacation', 'Hawaii', 'RV', 'trip', 'Colorado', 'hopes', 'sneak', 'off', 'meeting', 'germaphobe', 'boss', 'order', 'keep', 'job', 'way', 'course', 'keeping', 'true', 'intentions', 'secret', 'recreate', 'bond', 'once', 'had', 'family', 'course', 'starts', 'shakey', 'wife', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'children', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'Cassie', 'JoJo', 'going', 'rebelous', 'i', 'hate', 'mommy', 'daddy', 'stage', 'young', 'son', 'Carl', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'insecure', 'small', 'size', 'are', 'supportive', 'problems', 'sewage', 'weird', 'hillbilly', 'RV', 'neighbors', 'Gornicke', 'family', 'led', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'pesky', 'racoons', 'family', 'bonding', 'moment', 'shattered', 'bowel', 'problem', 'sort-of', 'sinking', 'RV', 'exposure', 'Bob', 'secret', 'meeting', 'end', 'RV', 'may', 'be', 'predictable', 'family', 'fun', 'point', 'still', 'family', 'fun', 'got', 'ta', 'amount', 'something']",N/A
999566,AILBDL6ATVDCJ,B000G8O0MK,"Dan Blankenship ""Author of THE RUNNING GIRL""","[3, 5]","""RV"" is a success because everyone in this movie knows how to deliver a line, set the mood, and have fun while making a film.Robin Williams (Bob Munro) is perfect as the Dad who needs to re-connect with his family.  He is also convincing as the employee with a boss in need of a soul.A movie like ""RV"" is so predictable that it takes a special comedic actor to pull it off.  And I doubt many others could do it.  Robin Williams is an extremely talented man, and he proves it in the way he approached and delivered the material offered him in this comedy.Half the fun of watching this movie was seeing the cast pull off their predictable scenes without trepidation.  I would have been wondering about the predictability aspect of the film, and therefore never have been able to concentrate on delivery and substance.  The cast of this film looked beyond this obstacle and made ""RV"" a complete success - a real joy to watch.Cheryl Hines (Jamie Munro) plays Bob's wife, a woman trying to make the best of a vacation gone horribly wrong.  She works well on screen with Williams.  She didn't overact her part, nor did she try and slip into the background and let Williams just control the movie.Joanna 'JoJo' Levesque (Cassie Munro) is a darling on the screen.  This young lady is destined for elite stardom.  She had some of the funniest lines in the movie, and having two teenage daughters of my own, I can attest to the fact that she nailed this role perfectly!  I know attitude and sarcasm and attitude when I see it.Josh Hutcherson (Carl Munro) is hilarious as the young and undersized-but-lifting-weights-like-a-fanatic son who delivers facial expressions (or doesn't) at just the right time and place to make the audience laugh without a word being spoken; another great credit to the casting director for adding this young man to the project.And finally, while Jeff Daniels (Travis Gornicke) performs well as the RV-living wild man, Kristin Chenoweth (Mary Jo Gornicke) steals every scene from the veteran Daniels.  Her bubbling spirit and gorgeous demeanor are truly addictive throughout the second half of the movie.""RV"" is an excellent comedy on all levels.  I highly recommend this DVD.

999568,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B000G8O0MK,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 2]","If you want a good, safe comedy the whole family can enjoy, RV fits the bill.  Sure, it doesn't exactly break any new ground, but the reason they keep making family vacation comedies like this is because they tend to be pretty entertaining - especially when a Robin Williams is featured in the cast.  There's more to this film than mere comedy, of course, as it has a lot to say about family.  The plot synopsis describes this family as dysfunctional - this could not be more wrong.  This is a completely normal family that almost everyone can identify with.  Bob Munro (Robin Williams) works hard to support his family, worries that he's going to lose his job to some stuck-up kid fresh of college, his wife has to deal with the pressures of getting the kids everywhere they need to go while also taking care of everything on the home front, and the kids are distant and always complaining (i.e., they're teenagers).  If this is dysfunctional, then America is overflowing with dysfunctional families.When his boss pulls the rug out from under Bob's upcoming business trip (with family) to Hawaii and replaces it with a scheduled presentation in Colorado, Bob tries to make up for the disappointment by renting an RV and spending some quality time with his family on the way to the Centennial State.  He knows he is running out of time if he's ever going to reconnect with his kids, Cassie (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) and Carl (Josh Hutcherson).  No one is excited at the prospect, and the trip gets off to a bumpy start, but the Munro family soon rolls its way into many a comical situation.  Naturally, you have a whole sequence built around emptying the RV's sewage tank and the obligatory face-off against nature (raccoons, in this case), but you also have the family's encounter(s) with the Gornicke family.  Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth put on a great show as seeming bumpkins who just keep popping up, despite the Munros' efforts to avoid them.  They're good people, though, even though they do come across as a little bit too happy - and they enjoy a kind of closeness with one another that Bob dreams of rediscovering with his own wife and kids.Juggling the rigors of the whole RV experience while surreptitiously trying to get a presentation written is a challenge, and then Bob still has to figure out a way to get to his meeting without his family knowing about it.  It's just the kind of thing to bring everyone together in the end, though - or maybe not.  Either way, it makes for quite a memorable family outing.There is a lot of physical comedy in the film, which Robin Williams pulls off with his trademark ease.  I think Williams is funniest when he gets into one of his manic, fast-talking states of random weirdness, but his character is pretty restrained in this regard.  That disappointed me a little, but that's just a matter of me asking this film for something it wasn't designed to give me.  It's still a very funny movie with great performances all around, and - as I mentioned earlier - it's a lot more family-friendly than most comedies being produced these days.

But at the very last minute his boss Todd Mallory, (Will Arnett) calls him up and tells him that the biggest sales pitch of his career is going to happen in a few days. Bob gets the idea that if he rents an RV, he can take his family across country to Colorado on vacation and also attend this business meeting. Funny and bizarre moments ensue...Going into ""RV"" I didn't know what to think about it but when I walked out of it just about an hour or so ago I must admit I liked it quite a bit. ""RV"" is a family road trip comedy, a genre made famous by ""National Lampoon's Vacation."" While no one will come out of this film feeling that they saw an original comedic masterpiece. I think if you look at it for what it is, a silly family comedy, you will be able to enjoy it. Personally, I found the film to be very amusing, more so than most others in the theater. There is just something about Robin Williams' comedic facial expressions that make me chuckle.The whole idea of this rich upper class family traveling in an RV is just amusing. You can't picture this class of people taking a road trip which is why this film is funny. The film features some really strong laughs including the scene where Bob tries to drive the RV over the mountain. I won't deny for a second, that there isn't much thinking involved when watching this film because that is clearly out of the question. But honestly some of the stuff that happened in this film is extremely amusing and I think in this case, it's amusing because it was over the top. Unlike most comedies when they try to drag out a joke, it doesn't work but in ""RV"" the longer the joke goes, the funnier it gets in my opinion.I also like how this film at times left it up to the audience's imagination. There are a couple of scenes that would have been really stupid and wouldn't work if they actually showed what was happening. The whole raccoon scene is a perfect example of this. I also like that although the humor was very low brow, it wasn't over done. What I mean by that was the jokes are funny but they are somewhat spaced out. Not like with ""Scary Movie 4"" where you have a new joke every other minute.It's nice seeing Robin Williams come back and do comedy. I personally think he is one of those actors who can do both comedy and drama. He played the father figure very well here and like I said his facial expressions are always amusing. Also his little rap that he did in this film was hilarious. Robin is truly a talented actor. As for the rest of the cast, they were all fine was well. JoJo, who I actually never seen in a film before, was decent as the rebellious daughter and Josh Hutcherson was good as the rap loving son. Cheryl Hines who played Robin Williams wife Jamie was also good. Also a very amusing appearance by Jeff Daniels was also a lot of fun; he really knows how to play those redneck characters.Barry Sonnefeld was the director of ""RV"" and I am not sure what to think of him. While some of his films are good, some of them are not. It's hit or miss with his films. I personally like the fact that a lot of his films including ""RV"" have the dark comedic touch to them, I pick up on these things and I seem to be one of the few people laughing when this happens but hey I find dark humor to be amusing. Mr. Sonnefeld does a good job in the directing chair here and he really creates all these weird and awkward obstacles that the Munro family has to overcome. Also the way he never allows the film to become overly sappy with family moments is also a nice touch.So in the end, ""RV"" is a fun time. It's not a masterpiece by any means but just a funny little comedy that most members of the family can enjoy. Robin Williams steals the show the entire film and I feel without him involved this movie would have been really bad. When you see this movie, just take it for what it is, a silly family road comedy. If you take it for what it is, you shouldn't be disappointed. This movie is just like the trailer and TV spots lead you to believe so if you like the television spots or trailer, see this movie. ""RV"" is a movie where you should be able to have a few hard laughs and be able to smile the entire time.My final rating for ""RV"" is a 7/10.",3,As you'd expect,1170201600,"01 31, 2007",2007,4436,"['RV', 'silly', 'fun', 'road', 'trip', 'comedy', 'entire', 'family.Bob', 'Munro', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'been', 'planning', 'take', 'wife', 'Jamie', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'two', 'children', 'Cassie', 'JoJo', 'Carl', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'Hawaii', 'very', 'last', 'minute', 'boss', 'Todd', 'Mallory', 'Will', 'Arnett', 'tells', 'biggest', 'sales', 'pitch', 'career', 'going', 'happen', 'few', 'days', 'Bob', 'idea', 'RV', 'can', 'take', 'family', 'country', 'Colorado', 'vacation', 'also', 'attend', 'business', 'meeting', 'Funny', 'bizarre', 'moments', 'ensue', 'Going', 'RV', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'walked', 'just', 'hour', 'so', 'must', 'admit', 'liked', 'quite', 'bit', 'RV', 'family', 'road', 'trip', 'comedy', 'genre', 'made', 'famous', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'one', 'will', 'come', 'film', 'feeling', 'saw', 'original', 'comedic', 'masterpiece', 'think', 'look', 'what', 'silly', 'family', 'comedy', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'enjoy', 'Personally', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'very', 'amusing', 'more', 'so', 'most', 'others', 'theater', 'just', 'something', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'comedic', 'facial', 'expressions', 'make', 'chuckle.The', 'whole', 'idea', 'rich', 'upper', 'class', 'family', 'traveling', 'RV', 'just', 'amusing', 'ca', ""n't"", 'picture', 'class', 'people', 'taking', 'road', 'trip', 'why', 'film', 'funny', 'film', 'really', 'strong', 'laughs', 'including', 'scene', 'where', 'Bob', 'drive', 'RV', 'mountain', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deny', 'second', ""n't"", 'much', 'thinking', 'involved', 'when', 'watching', 'film', 'clearly', 'question', 'honestly', 'stuff', 'happened', 'film', 'extremely', 'amusing', 'think', 'case', 'amusing', 'was', 'top', 'most', 'comedies', 'when', 'try', 'drag', 'out', 'joke', ""n't"", 'work', 'RV', 'longer', 'joke', 'funnier', 'opinion.I', 'also', 'how', 'film', 'times', 'left', 'up', 'audience', 'imagination', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'stupid', 'would', ""n't"", 'work', 'actually', 'showed', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'whole', 'raccoon', 'scene', 'perfect', 'example', 'also', 'like', 'humor', 'was', 'very', 'low', 'brow', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'What', 'mean', 'was', 'jokes', 'are', 'funny', 'are', 'somewhat', 'spaced', 'out', 'Not', 'Scary', 'Movie', '4', 'where', 'have', 'new', 'joke', 'other', 'minute.It', 'nice', 'seeing', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'come', 'back', 'do', 'comedy', 'personally', 'think', 'one', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'comedy', 'drama', 'played', 'father', 'figure', 'very', 'well', 'here', 'said', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'always', 'amusing', 'Also', 'little', 'rap', 'did', 'film', 'was', 'hilarious', 'Robin', 'truly', 'talented', 'actor', 'rest', 'cast', 'were', 'fine', 'was', 'well', 'JoJo', 'who', 'actually', 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'decent', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'was', 'good', 'rap', 'loving', 'son', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'who', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'wife', 'Jamie', 'was', 'also', 'good', 'Also', 'very', 'amusing', 'appearance', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'was', 'also', 'lot', 'fun', 'really', 'how', 'play', 'redneck', 'characters.Barry', 'Sonnefeld', 'was', 'director', 'RV', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'what', 'think', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'are', 'not', 'hit', 'miss', 'films', 'personally', 'fact', 'lot', 'films', 'including', 'RV', 'have', 'dark', 'comedic', 'touch', 'pick', 'up', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'people', 'laughing', 'when', 'hey', 'find', 'dark', 'humor', 'be', 'amusing', 'Mr.', 'Sonnefeld', 'good', 'job', 'directing', 'chair', 'here', 'really', 'weird', 'awkward', 'obstacles', 'Munro', 'family', 'overcome', 'Also', 'way', 'never', 'film', 'become', 'overly', 'sappy', 'family', 'moments', 'also', 'nice', 'touch.So', 'end', 'RV', 'fun', 'time', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'means', 'just', 'funny', 'little', 'comedy', 'most', 'members', 'family', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'show', 'entire', 'film', 'feel', 'involved', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'bad', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'take', 'what', 'silly', 'family', 'road', 'comedy', 'take', 'what', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'just', 'trailer', 'TV', 'spots', 'lead', 'believe', 'so', 'like', 'television', 'spots', 'trailer', 'see', 'movie', 'RV', 'movie', 'where', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'few', 'hard', 'laughs', 'be', 'able', 'smile', 'entire', 'time.My', 'final', 'rating', 'RV', '7/10']",N/A

Problems start with the family just as soon as Bob finds out that he is needed for work down in Boulder, Colorado at the same time as a planned vacation to Hawaii with the wife and kids. Bob (with the advice of friends) plans to rent a (u guessed it!...) R.V and instead of taking a trip to Hawaii plans a ""fun.."" filled R.V trip to the Mountians of Colorado, as you can imagine this goes over quite well with the rest of the family .... not!. In this way Bob figures that he can make his boss happy by going to the meeting held in Boulder as well as getting his wife and children off his back as well.I'm not going to dig to deep into the screenplay but as I am sure you would have guessed, the comedy is apperent from the get go, problems arise, feelings are hurt ... OH THE DRAMA! THE SUSPENSE IS TOO MUCH! but as always we all live happily ever after ...I can honestly say that R.V is one of the most predictable films ever made. I had high hopes at the beginning but in the end it shows that it is just a bunch of cliche's from all sorts of comedys thrown together. I am not saying that it doesnt have some laughs because it does have a few. As Always Robin Williams voice impersonations make the audience laugh out loud on more than a few occasions, a few other witty remarks draw some laughs as well. Jeff Daniels in his supporting role as Travis Gornicke is very well played, him and his wife Marie Jo (played by Kristin Chenoweth) bring some fun aspects to the film and are quite fun to watch. I think that the film would have been more interesting if it followed the Gornicke's instead of the Monroes ...Final Thought: This film is the King of cliche's but despite that fact the film is quite funny and is a decent little family feature. The kids will love it but dont let the laughs and loveable charactors trick you, the film brings nothing new to the table and is suprisingly pointless.

I had never heard of RV--nor knew Williams starred in it--until I caught the movie on cable recently, and pulled up a chair.  I found the movie funny (hysterically funny at times), entertaining, corny, and predictable--just the kind of light comedy to put a smile on your mug and forget the troubles of the day.  Which is what an effective comedy does.RV is, of course, the latest version of the ""family vacation from hell"" movie; Williams plays a father and husband who rents an RV (knowing next to nothing about them) to bond with his family--yet at the same time he must complete a presentation for his self-centered, greedy boss (Will Arnett is such a great comedic actor) for a pending merger.  Murphy's Law promptly takes over, and chaos rules the day (I was rolling on the floor watching Williams trying to figure out how to drain the sewage tank), with Williams and family constantly being bailed out by a wily redneck family, led by Jeff Daniels and the diminutive Kristin Chenoweth.  Naturally, Williams's character alienates his family, then wins them back as the film moves towards its daffy, predictable ending.A very attractive Cheryl Hines plays the wife, and Williams makes RV one of his best films in recent years because he goes back to what he does best:  physical shtick.

The normally manic Robin Williams has once again become constrained by the mechanics of a dismal script, this one by Geoff Rodkey, that seems to be taken from the same handbook as ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" and ""Meet the Fokkers"". Directed by the genuinely quirky Barry Sonnenfeld, the sitcom-level plot has Williams play desperate middle-management executive Bob Munro, whose boss threatens termination should he not make a key presentation to a Ben & Jerry's-type independent soda company that his company wants to purchase.In the middle of this predicament, Bob has promised his family a vacation in Hawaii, a plan he unilaterally converts into a trip on an elaborate RV to Colorado within close proximity of the soda company headquarters. The rest of the movie is about the shenanigans that occur on the trip as Bob secretly prepares his presentation and his family suffers for all the forced bonding. There isn't a plot turn here you can't predict quite easily beforehand, and what's worse, the story seems to thrive on one potty-related joke after another. The result is a contrived, mirthless mess compounded by the stilted, uninvolved performances. Williams is simply muzzled beyond any reasonable interest, and Cheryl Hines (Larry David's acerbic wife on HBO's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") is also wasted as Bob's embittered, emaciated wife Jamie.Playing the overly friendly white-trash couple from hell, Jeff Daniels and the overly squeaky Kristin Chenoweth are in ham-overdrive. It's rather disheartening to see Daniels follow his impressive work in ""The Squid and the Whale"" with this apparent lark. Will Arnett of ""Arrested Development"" seems to be in the same cartoon-like alternative universe as Bob's boss.

This is not the greatest comedy ever done, but it is way funnier than most.  Why?  There are numerous tight little jokes Robin Williams slips in, muttered under his breath, that really amp things up in my book.  Plus, his character is such a nice guy you really want him to succeed.Robin Williams plays a corporate pitch man who has to cancel his family's Hawaii vacation because his young, heartless boss wants him to make a presentation to another company a couple of states away.  Robin gets the brilliant idea to rent an RV, and take the family with him to the presentation--while neglecting to tell them the true nature of the journey.  And, as they say, hi-jinks ensue.There are really good supporting performances, especially Jeff Daniels.  The plot has a lot of funny little twists to it, and although not everything works, enough of it works to make it worth while.  BUT when you add in the extras on the DVD, things get really funny.

Robin Williams plays Bob Munro, a man who often thinks more about work than his family. He uses the ploy of a ""family bonding"" experience to get his family to agree to a road trip to the Rockies, all the while intending to attend a business meeting in Colorado.  As you can imagine, Bob, with his dysfunctional family in tow, encounter various mishaps  and obstacles along the way. While this film tries to be light-hearted fun, it comes across as unoriginal and flat. Most of the humor is simple, juvenile and feeble, often resorting  to potty humor or clich&eacute;s to entertain or gain laughs. The characters are unoriginal, and the resolution is contrived and a bit vomit-inducing.Over all, RV is a pretty lame attempt at comedy. It's difficult to figure out what's worse--the plot, the attempts at humor, the characters, or the ham-fisted family lessons learned by our protagonist father (Robin Williams). Or maybe they are all equally bad.If you are in the mood for a road trip comedy, do yourself a favor and just watch the far superior comedy ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" again.",2,Just watch National Lampoon's Vacation instead,1372982400,"07 5, 2013",2013,1212,"['RV', 'one', 'regurgitated', 'clueless', 'father', 'moment', 'realization', 'comedies', 'time', 'form', 'road', 'trip', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'man', 'who', 'often', 'more', 'work', 'family', 'ploy', 'family', 'bonding', 'experience', 'get', 'family', 'agree', 'road', 'trip', 'Rockies', 'while', 'intending', 'attend', 'business', 'meeting', 'Colorado', 'can', 'imagine', 'Bob', 'dysfunctional', 'family', 'tow', 'encounter', 'various', 'mishaps', 'obstacles', 'way', 'film', 'be', 'light-hearted', 'fun', 'unoriginal', 'flat', 'Most', 'humor', 'simple', 'juvenile', 'feeble', 'often', 'resorting', 'potty', 'humor', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'entertain', 'gain', 'laughs', 'characters', 'are', 'unoriginal', 'resolution', 'contrived', 'bit', 'vomit-inducing.Over', 'RV', 'pretty', 'lame', 'attempt', 'comedy', 'difficult', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'worse', 'plot', 'attempts', 'humor', 'characters', 'ham-fisted', 'family', 'lessons', 'learned', 'protagonist', 'father', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'maybe', 'are', 'equally', 'are', 'mood', 'road', 'trip', 'comedy', 'do', 'favor', 'just', 'watch', 'far', 'superior', 'comedy', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Vacation', 'again']",N/A

Well this is yet another example, but to my considerable surpriseRVis a much better movie than I expected from the trailer.After his daughter's friend throws a drink in his boss's face in protest of his EVIL corporation's ""crime"" of marketing fattening beverages to children, Bob (Robin Williams) Munro's repulsive boss, Todd Mallory (Will Arnett), forces him to cancel his family's Hawaii vacation in order to shore up a very important acquisition proposal in Boulder, Colorado.  Rather than confess the truth to his dysfunctional family (and worried enough to try something desperate to save said family), Bob rents a hideous, hulking green R.V. and puts his incredulous upper middle class suburban family on the road to Colorado.  Cascading disasters follow.A couple of things salvage this movie from the garbage heap of this genre.  The most important (and the most surprising) are a family of RV'ing oddballs, the Gornickes (Jeff Daniels, Kristin Chenoweth, Hunter Parrish, Chloe Sonnenfeld, and Alex Ferris).  At first sight I was convinced that I was watching Yet Another ignorant and offensive Hollywood riff on that large segment of their potential customer base they dismiss as Southern White Trash.  But by the end of the movie this good-hearted, walkin' not just talkin' Christian family of Texans have not only dispelled almost every stereotype they seemed to embody at first sight, but they have overlooked a lot of citified rudeness in order to save the Munros' bacon again and again and again.  Second, Robin Williams manages to make likeable a character that IMHO Chevy Chase and Steve Martin among others failed to.Defects?  The abject stupidity required for many of the mistakes.  Bob Munro having trouble getting used to driving a behemoth and throwing caution to the wind in order to race back from the company meeting his family doesn't know about, I can accept.  Forgetting to chock the wheels after disastrous runaways number 2, 3, 4, etc., I really can't.  Second, they have made Bob's boss so hideous that you find it impossible to believe that Bob would have worked for him even this long or that Mallory could have kept his own job.  Perhaps it is different in Hollywood, but in the REAL corporate world evil incarnate managers are somewhat frowned upon for having a negative impact on employee retention.

999591,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000G8O0MK,General Breadbasket,"[1, 2]","After a string of thrillers, Robin Williams is back to doing comedy in RV. It was something to do on a Saturday night, so I went to see it with my girlfriend. The projector had technical difficulties that night, which was funny since it slowed Robin Williams voice down mid sentence, but it played the film without a hitch after it was fixed.Robin Williams plays Bob Munro, a hard working but underappreciated businessman who has promised his family a trip to Hawaii, a promise that due to pressures at work he can no longer keep. Instead, he does the next best thing, he rents a ""state of the art"" RV and drives his disappointed family to a lake in Colorado, where his parents used to take him when he was a boy. Things do not go so smoothly at all, though. The RV has faulty brakes and a blocked up sewage system, and Bob has a stack of work to catch up on. To top it all off, the family has to tussle with raccoons, a thieving folk singer and the overwhelming enthusiasm of Gornicke family. Will Bob send his paperwork in on time? Will his Internet connection work in the middle of nowhere? Will he win back his daughter's love and his son's respect? Most importantly, can he keep the RV in one piece?It felt a lot like a TV sitcom in a way, but with a bigger budget and higher quality direction. A lot of recent movies I've seen have that feel, I've noticed. It's kind of funny, since a lot of TV dramas look and feel more and more like movies.  It's kind of an odd thing to point out in a comedy, but I quite liked the colour scheme in the film, the broad range of saturated shades highlighted the beautiful Colorado scenery. Makes a change from films that have all these filters in them.""RV"" isn't an amazing film, but its entertaining enough. If it was anyone else but Robin Williams in the lead, I don't think it would have worked at all. Jack Black maybe, that would have been interesting. As it is, it just kind of wanders along. In the cinema I saw it in there was a father with two kids, a girl and a boy (just like Robin Williams in the film) and they seemed to enjoy it.If you liked this movie, I recommend ""National Lampoon's Family Vacation"", a film that points out a whole range of troubles a family can have while out and about on the road, and a film I like a fair bit more than this one.",3,RV Starring RW,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",2006,2307,"['string', 'thrillers', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'back', 'doing', 'comedy', 'RV', 'was', 'something', 'do', 'Saturday', 'night', 'went', 'see', 'girlfriend', 'projector', 'had', 'technical', 'difficulties', 'night', 'was', 'funny', 'slowed', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'voice', 'down', 'mid', 'sentence', 'played', 'film', 'hitch', 'was', 'fixed.Robin', 'Williams', 'plays', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'hard', 'working', 'underappreciated', 'businessman', 'who', 'promised', 'family', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'promise', 'due', 'pressures', 'work', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'keep', 'Instead', 'next', 'best', 'thing', 'state', 'art', 'RV', 'disappointed', 'family', 'lake', 'Colorado', 'where', 'parents', 'used', 'take', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'Things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'so', 'smoothly', 'though', 'RV', 'faulty', 'brakes', 'blocked', 'up', 'sewage', 'system', 'Bob', 'stack', 'work', 'catch', 'up', 'top', 'off', 'family', 'tussle', 'raccoons', 'thieving', 'folk', 'singer', 'overwhelming', 'enthusiasm', 'Gornicke', 'family', 'Will', 'Bob', 'send', 'paperwork', 'time', 'Will', 'Internet', 'connection', 'work', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'Will', 'win', 'back', 'daughter', 'love', 'son', 'respect', 'Most', 'importantly', 'can', 'keep', 'RV', 'one', 'piece', 'felt', 'lot', 'TV', 'sitcom', 'way', 'bigger', 'budget', 'higher', 'quality', 'direction', 'lot', 'recent', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'have', 'feel', ""'ve"", 'noticed', 'kind', 'funny', 'lot', 'TV', 'dramas', 'look', 'feel', 'more', 'more', 'movies', 'kind', 'odd', 'thing', 'point', 'out', 'comedy', 'quite', 'liked', 'colour', 'scheme', 'film', 'broad', 'range', 'saturated', 'shades', 'highlighted', 'beautiful', 'Colorado', 'scenery', 'change', 'films', 'have', 'filters', 'RV', ""n't"", 'amazing', 'film', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'was', 'anyone', 'else', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'lead', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'Jack', 'Black', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'just', 'kind', 'wanders', 'along', 'cinema', 'saw', 'was', 'father', 'two', 'kids', 'girl', 'boy', 'just', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'it.If', 'liked', 'movie', 'recommend', 'National', 'Lampoon', 'Family', 'Vacation', 'film', 'out', 'whole', 'range', 'troubles', 'family', 'can', 'have', 'while', 'out', 'road', 'film', 'like', 'fair', 'bit', 'more', 'one']",N/A

With so much at stake, it is only valid that he try and make ends meet, no matter what it takes.With that in mind, he cancels the family's Hawaii vacation, promising them an even better vacation in the mountains of Colorado (so that he can attend an important meeting which coincidentally happens to be at the same place!), and en-route there, in the RV that he has rented for them all.What ensues is a rather slapstick, formulaic story with the husband trying to be funny while making ends meet, the family always making fun of him (and often with good reason), and the friendly RV family they happen to meet on the way just adds to the fun.There are elements I found I had seen used to much better effect in some other movies, and that's also why I was dejected with this movie.In a single stroke - it tries to be funny, but only ends up being silly.2 / 5 (only because of William's enthusiasm!)",2,"Not a gem, and almost not bad either...",1216512000,"07 20, 2008",2008,1662,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'come', 'down', 'not-so-good', 'days', 'late', 'remember', 'work', 'done', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'Bicentennial', 'Man', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'why', 'even', 'Mindy', ""'d"", 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'about.Happened', 'see', 'movie', 'recently', 'rental', 'DVD', 'was', 'mildly', 'disappointed', 'Monroe', 'family', 'had', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'terms', 'humor', 'Robin', 'known', 'inculcate', 'plot', 'characters', 'seeing', 'formulae', 'unfold', 'was', 'let-down.Williams', 'hard-working', 'executive', 'doing', 'can', 'appease', 'tyrannical', 'boss', 'who', 'threatening', 'replace', 'Williams', 'someone', 'younger', 'generation', 'Williams', 'job', 'family', 'will', 'lose', 'not', 'just', 'paycheck', 'lifestyle', 'so', 'much', 'stake', 'only', 'valid', 'try', 'make', 'ends', 'meet', 'matter', 'what', 'takes.With', 'mind', 'family', 'Hawaii', 'vacation', 'promising', 'even', 'better', 'vacation', 'mountains', 'Colorado', 'so', 'can', 'attend', 'important', 'meeting', 'coincidentally', 'be', 'same', 'place', 'en-route', 'there', 'RV', 'rented', 'ensues', 'rather', 'slapstick', 'formulaic', 'story', 'husband', 'trying', 'be', 'funny', 'making', 'ends', 'meet', 'family', 'always', 'making', 'fun', 'often', 'good', 'reason', 'friendly', 'RV', 'family', 'happen', 'meet', 'way', 'just', 'fun.There', 'are', 'elements', 'found', 'had', 'seen', 'used', 'much', 'better', 'effect', 'other', 'movies', 'also', 'why', 'was', 'dejected', 'movie.In', 'single', 'stroke', 'be', 'funny', 'only', 'up', 'being', 'silly.2', '5', 'only', 'William', 'enthusiasm']",N/A
999597,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B000G8O0MK,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 3]","SPOILERS alert.With this blah family feature, Robin Williams continues his lukewarm run at the box office. Having been denied a trip to Hawaii and, instead, being forced to work on a job presentation, Bob Munro foists on his dysfunctional family an undesired motor home trek to the Colorado Rockies, wherein, coincidentally, a work meeting is to take place. Accordingly, Bob rents a monstrous green RV his leering kids would dub the Big Rolling Turd, and they're not that far wrong. Most of the ensuing hijinks would result from the bulkiness and sheer unaccessibility of the RV, although a lot of it, too, has to do with Bob's inability to properly navigate the ugly thing.The film is nicely served by a more demure Robin Williams as he foregoes his usual maniacal side and turns in a more down to earth performance. He's actually quite believable as the dad under siege, trying to keep his family together via road trip whilst simultaneously bringing home the bacon. Cheryl Hines is good as Bob's more or less supportive wife (who can belt out ""Little GTO"" with the worst of them), while Joanna ""Jo Jo"" Levesque is decent as the daughter going thru that phase. Young Josh Hutcherson, on the other hand, is more or less annoying as the rap-influenced son, Carl Munro. But, to me, the standouts are the Gornicke clan, who at first comes off as your typical goofy, red-necked buffoons (think Brady Bunch/Partridge Family gone ""yee-hah!"") but who actually unveils hidden depths and embodies the ideal familial kinship that Bob has been striving to regain. Jeff Daniels, Kristin Chenoweth, and the kids who play the Gornicke kids are all a happy hoot.The humor comes at you subtle like a wrecking ball. There are septic tank miscues, wild rodents on the attack, the aforementioned so-content-it's-almost-cultish Gornicke family, and plenty of cringe-worthy driving mishaps. But it's all in good fun, it's mildly amusing, no rodents were actually hurt in the making of the film, and there's that old family values mainstay at the core of it all, which, I guess, goes some way in atoning for the lack of real laughs. Once upon a time, I would've expected more from Robin Williams. But I guess the days of MRS.

This is a super funny movie and I was glad to see Robin Williams performing at his best!  It's a story of a disconnected suburban family that has surrendered to the complications of summer sports schedules, rushed suppers, family conversations by instant messaging and email or yelling across rooms, office travel and deadlines, and loosing touch with children that are growing up.  Instead of the long talked about Hawaiin cruise, the family decides to go on a family RV adventure in THE ROLLING TURD, according to his pre-teen son, as to accommodate dad so he can sneak off for an off site business presentation.  Dad frantically prepares this presentation in the wee hours of the night, hiding in a single stall bathroom, so his family doesn't know he's doing business.  His inability to achieve cell signal to send his long promised spreadhseet file to his panicing boss compromises his future with the company.  He hops from RV campsites, to hole in the wall diners, to hilltops where they remote camp, all secretly awaiting a strong enough signal to send his file.  Out of desperation, he makes the choice to attend the meeting in person, only after his lap top is stolen at a rest stop.  Along the way, they meet up with an unlikely RV family who befriends them and won't leave them alone.  They're a little too hoe down'en, chipper, and perky for the suburban family.  Don't we all have a couple or friend like this?  They just don't take a hint, or no for an answer!  With Dad's shifty decoys, he is able to pull off his presentation in person to his boss and attending firm but not without a price.  The family learns to reconnect with each other and nature.  This is a hilarious movie that will have your whole family laughing throughout!  Robin Williams can make anything funny!

As far as family vacation movies go, Vacation with Chevy Chase was, by far, a better package.  RV doesn't break any new ground in comedy or story-telling.  It doesn't even really showcase Robin Williams like other movies have.However, if you are in the mood for some light-hearted mindlessness, RV will provide 99 minutes of that.  The better character in this movie, in my opinion, was Jeff Daniels' Travis Gornicke.  The story goes that the actors had to be trained in how to drive RVs - with the exception of Daniels.  Apparently, he has his own RV and spends a fair amount of time in it.This movie has a cartoonish quality to it.  The characters have a cartoonish quality to them, somewhat overplayed.

It's not. The script is horrible. It's dreadful. It's a mistake--110+ pages of mistake. The initial concept of the film (a guy rents an RV and takes his family on a problem-filled vacation) is a great one--I love road films and who could do a better one than Robin Williams and Cheryl Hines? Both charming and funny actors with amazing appeal. But the backstory on this film, the lame idea that Robin Williams' character is hiding his secret motive to attend an important business conference is just so lame. Why was a complication like that even necessary? Isn't taking two teenagers across country in an RV ripe enough with funny possibilities? Chevy Chase's Vacation? Hello!!!But instead of just making a funny road movie about an RV obsessed father taking his unwilling family on vacation, the writer(s) here decided that it needed an extra wrinkle: workaholic Williams plotting to get to some big meeting. Ugggggh. It's like a Disney script written by children instead of for them.Also, the entire idea of being in an RV starts out with such great comic promise: the toilet is not working. And THAT sequence is actually funny. It's the last funny thing you'll see in this movie. From there on the movie is one long RV joke about long RVs and ridiculous scenes of driving over mountain roads and into lakes. Please. If you want to see a funny movie that takes this theme and provides killer comedy, just rent Lucy & Ricky'sThe Long, Long Trailer"" Perfection. Robin Williams hanging onto the hood of the RV as it plunges--driverless--down a mountain road is utter nonsense. Suspend disbelief? You'd have to suspend all human experience to find this remotely amusing.That said, I will say this: Jeff Daniels is terrific. Why this guy isn't the highest paid actor in Hollywood, I'll never know. He is the saving grace (if there is one) of this film. And it seems to me like a better writer wrote his lines. In fact, I'm sure of it. And Robin Williams, while he didn't even phone in this role (he sent a body double), is somehow oddly comforting to watch on the screen. How is this possible? Here is the worst script I've seen in decades and Williams remains someone you want to watch.Personally, I think that Robin Williams owes us all a refund--not for not being charming, he is--but for agreeing to do this movie after he read the script. He should have turned it down or forced them to rewrite it. That's what star power is for, isn't it--getting good scripts? Sorry Robin, but you stole the money on this one and we deserve a refund--not for your acting, but for your willingness to make any movie if the money is right. How much money do you need, anyway?Anyway, if you want a comforting stupid movie to keep you company on a summer's night, spend a buck on a used copy at your local video store (don't pay Amazon $2.99 to ship it to you). But trust me, you will watch this film and at the end you'll say: ""Wow, this could have been the best road film of all time. Instead, it's probably the worst.""Then the next weekend, go rent:Midnight RunorDutchand see what real road-film genius is all about. Or watch a Williams masterpiece:Moscow on the Hudson.Still, I have to say, that Williams guy is one helluva charmer. And I hope his health is doing well.

Loria,"[12, 17]","Director Barry Sonnefield has a body of funny work behind him: Adams Family & Adams Family Values, MIB (1&2), Wild Wild West, as well as a quirky body of work as a producer and cinematographer like 3 `0 clock High, Raising Arizona, Lemon Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. So a film, in which he has the chance to direct the ""phenomenal cosmic power"" of Robin Williams targeting the family demographic, is in well-charted, extremely safe waters. That is what RV, a film guaranteed to make you laugh, but with no inspirations to do more.  Ultimately a wasted of Williams comic genius, but the family vacation disaster comedy is an industry money-making staple delivering an evening of entertainment, if not a legacy for Williams' or Sonnefield's career. The film does invite comparison with National Lampoon's 1983 classic Vacation. Chevy Chase like Williams makes disastrous vacation plans without the family's consent. Another comparison within the genre is older still, in the 50's Lucille Ball and Desi Arnez made a Technicolor dud called ""The Long, Long Trailer"" in which (you guessed it) vacation plans go bad. Most recently you could add: ""Cheaper by the Dozen II."" ""Meet the Fockers"" and ""Are We there yet?""In RV, Williams plays Bob Munro, dad who is forced to cancel a family trip to Hawaii, like Chase's Griswold, instead renting a recreation vehicle or RV (get it) to travel to Boulder, Colorado (ironically the place Williams ""began"" his career as the adopted home of MORK & MINDY, I know it wasn't really shot in Colorado). With so familiar a concept the predictability of this movie sets in almost immediately after the RV rental. The viewer is ready for things are going to go wrong and boy does it. Munro can't drive it or even work the seatbelt, dishes fall out of the cabinets, the parking brake is broken, the stove doesn't heat up, the sewage line backs up providing landmark potty-humor, and more.Of course, along the way, they meet the obligatory pest family lead by Travis Gornike (Jeff Daniels), is a welcome diversion, for the audience anyway. Williams continues to get into more outrageous scenerios, lost laptops, fightin' `coons (surreal animal action is always a crowd pleaser), lost in the mountains, near loss of life and limb, anything imaginable to wreck the Winnebago, contend with the camper community and learn a lesson on the journey. In the end, most of the talent involved here, could have done better, Robin Williams alone without a script could carry a 90 min. film, but this one maybe would have been funnier as just a ""long, long trailer.""",3,Got Vacation?,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,2586,"['Director', 'Barry', 'Sonnefield', 'body', 'funny', 'work', 'Adams', 'Family', 'Adams', 'Family', 'Values', 'MIB', '1', '2', 'Wild', 'Wild', 'West', 'as', 'well', 'quirky', 'body', 'work', 'producer', 'cinematographer', '3', '0', 'clock', 'High', 'Raising', 'Arizona', 'Lemon', 'Snicket', 'Series', 'Unfortunate', 'Events', 'film', 'chance', 'direct', 'phenomenal', 'cosmic', 'power', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'targeting', 'family', 'demographic', 'well-charted', 'extremely', 'safe', 'waters', 'what', 'RV', 'film', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'laugh', 'inspirations', 'do', 'more', 'Ultimately', 'wasted', 'Williams', 'comic', 'genius', 'family', 'vacation', 'disaster', 'comedy', 'industry', 'money-making', 'staple', 'delivering', 'evening', 'entertainment', 'not', 'legacy', 'Williams', 'Sonnefield', 'career', 'film', 'invite', 'comparison', 'National', 'Lampoon', '1983', 'classic', 'Vacation', 'Chevy', 'Chase', 'Williams', 'disastrous', 'vacation', 'plans', 'family', 'consent', 'comparison', 'genre', 'older', 'still', '50', 'Lucille', 'Ball', 'Desi', 'Arnez', 'made', 'Technicolor', 'dud', 'called', 'Long', 'Long', 'Trailer', 'guessed', 'vacation', 'plans', 'go', 'bad', 'Most', 'recently', 'could', 'add', 'Cheaper', 'Dozen', 'II', 'Meet', 'Fockers', 'Are', 'yet', 'RV', 'Williams', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'dad', 'who', 'forced', 'cancel', 'family', 'trip', 'Hawaii', 'Chase', 'Griswold', 'instead', 'renting', 'recreation', 'vehicle', 'RV', 'get', 'travel', 'Boulder', 'Colorado', 'ironically', 'place', 'Williams', 'began', 'career', 'adopted', 'home', 'MORK', 'MINDY', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'shot', 'Colorado', 'so', 'familiar', 'concept', 'predictability', 'movie', 'almost', 'immediately', 'RV', 'rental', 'viewer', 'ready', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'go', 'wrong', 'boy', 'Munro', 'ca', ""n't"", 'drive', 'even', 'work', 'seatbelt', 'dishes', 'fall', 'cabinets', 'parking', 'brake', 'broken', 'stove', ""n't"", 'heat', 'up', 'sewage', 'line', 'up', 'providing', 'landmark', 'potty-humor', 'more.Of', 'course', 'way', 'meet', 'obligatory', 'pest', 'family', 'lead', 'Travis', 'Gornike', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'welcome', 'diversion', 'audience', 'anyway', 'Williams', 'get', 'more', 'outrageous', 'scenerios', 'lost', 'laptops', 'fightin', 'coons', 'surreal', 'animal', 'action', 'always', 'crowd', 'pleaser', 'lost', 'mountains', 'near', 'loss', 'life', 'limb', 'anything', 'imaginable', 'wreck', 'Winnebago', 'contend', 'camper', 'community', 'learn', 'lesson', 'journey', 'end', 'most', 'talent', 'involved', 'here', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'alone', 'script', 'could', 'carry', '90', 'min', 'film', 'one', 'maybe', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'funnier', 'just', 'long', 'long', 'trailer']",N/A

Not to be deterred, the studio suits found another soon-to-be washed up comedian in Robin Williams to take the lead role instead, playing Bob Munro: a sweet, well-meaning but hopelessly out of touch middle aged dad who's likely to lose his job if he won't cancel his Hawaii vacation plans to help his smarmy, germophobic boss pull off a big corporate soda-pop acquisition. Bob, determined to somehow combine his work and still pull off the big family vacation, rents a monstrous, green RV (immediately dubbed 'The Rolling Turd' by his snotty teenage daughter), shanghai's his relunctant family and sets off for the big meeting in Colorado.Let the comedic hi-jinks ensue.Ho-hum. As noted, RV feels like the long lost last installment of Chase's 'Vacation' films. Maybe it's just me, but the usually frantic Williams just seems sad and slightly pathetic in all of his movies lately, unable to work up the barest hint of his former wacky comedic self; and when he does manage to build up a little bit of energy here, like during his ill-fated battle with the racoons or while coming to the aid of his 'lil homie son, his schtick just comes across tired and forced (I mean really, does anybody really think the bit where the fifty-something white guy from the 'burbs tries to throw down is funny anymore?) Truthfully, none of the jokes are very original, and the entire cast is pretty much wasted. It's like they gave up the ghost during pre-production. Director Barry Sonnenfeld pulls another hack job here too, picking up a paycheck while not adding even a smidgen of his trademarked frenetic visual flair. The best parts of the movie are supplied by the supporting cast of Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth as the pseudo-hicky Gornicke's, living large on a permanent zany road trip in their custom red bus.There's a couple yucks spread out here and there, but mostly this dog is a tired re-hash of better (and worse) summer comedies past.",3,"Apparently, Chevy Chase wasn't available...",1156809600,"08 29, 2006",2006,2018,"['more', 'likely', 'had', 'sense', 'say', 'forget', 'read', 'script', 'Not', 'be', 'deterred', 'studio', 'suits', 'found', 'soon-to-be', 'washed', 'up', 'comedian', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'take', 'lead', 'role', 'instead', 'playing', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'sweet', 'well-meaning', 'hopelessly', 'touch', 'middle', 'aged', 'dad', 'who', 'likely', 'lose', 'job', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cancel', 'Hawaii', 'vacation', 'plans', 'help', 'smarmy', 'germophobic', 'pull', 'big', 'corporate', 'soda-pop', 'acquisition', 'Bob', 'determined', 'somehow', 'combine', 'work', 'still', 'pull', 'off', 'big', 'family', 'vacation', 'monstrous', 'green', 'RV', 'immediately', 'dubbed', ""'The"", 'Rolling', 'Turd', 'snotty', 'teenage', 'daughter', 'shanghai', 'relunctant', 'family', 'sets', 'off', 'big', 'meeting', 'Colorado.Let', 'comedic', 'hi-jinks', 'ensue.Ho-hum', 'noted', 'RV', 'feels', 'long', 'lost', 'last', 'installment', 'Chase', ""'Vacation"", 'films', 'Maybe', 'just', 'usually', 'frantic', 'Williams', 'just', 'sad', 'slightly', 'pathetic', 'movies', 'lately', 'unable', 'work', 'up', 'barest', 'hint', 'former', 'wacky', 'comedic', 'self', 'when', 'manage', 'build', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'energy', 'here', 'ill-fated', 'battle', 'racoons', 'coming', 'aid', 'homie', 'son', 'schtick', 'just', 'across', 'tired', 'forced', 'mean', 'really', 'anybody', 'really', 'think', 'bit', 'where', 'fifty-something', 'white', 'guy', ""'burbs"", 'tries', 'throw', 'down', 'funny', 'anymore', 'Truthfully', 'none', 'jokes', 'are', 'very', 'original', 'entire', 'cast', 'pretty', 'much', 'wasted', 'gave', 'up', 'ghost', 'pre-production', 'Director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'hack', 'job', 'here', 'too', 'picking', 'up', 'paycheck', 'not', 'adding', 'even', 'smidgen', 'trademarked', 'frenetic', 'visual', 'flair', 'best', 'parts', 'movie', 'are', 'supplied', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'pseudo-hicky', 'Gornicke', 'living', 'large', 'permanent', 'zany', 'road', 'trip', 'custom', 'red', 'couple', 'yucks', 'spread', 'here', 'there', 'mostly', 'dog', 'tired', 're-hash', 'better', 'worse', 'summer', 'comedies']",N/A

Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[11, 17]","With Robin Williams playing the patriarch of the Munro clan, and his wife being played by wonderful comedic actress, Cheryl Hines, not to mention comedy hitmaker, Barry Sonnenfield at the helm, you'd think that ""RV"" would be a really funny film.  Instead, ""RV"" never really hits the gas pedal.  It just rumbles along a very dull comedic road that almost seems never-ending at times.Williams plays Bob Munro, a father on the verge of losing both his job and his connection with his children.  Hoping to bring his family closer together, Munro plans a trip to Hawaii.  Those plans are derailed by Munro's boss who insists that he meets him in Colorado in order to pitch a business deal to a soda company.  Desperate to keep his job, Munro cooks up a scheme to rent an RV to haul his family on a vacation to Colorado instead of Hawaii.  Tensions grow between Munro and his angst-ridden daughter (Joanna Levesque), and his short, angry, and all-around annoying son (Josh Hutcherson).Along the road to Colorado, the viewer gets a heaping helping of bland comedic sequences including an explosive sewer pump, wild raccoons, bad brakes, and plenty of other nonsense.  The only shining moments in this film appear with the appearance of Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth.  They play a couple of RV ""lifers"" who carry their kids with them everywhere they go in their custom RV.  Daniels is in top form here, showing just how funny he can really be.  I'm not that familiar with Chenoweth, but she is very easy on the eyes and plays her character in top-notch fashion.I mildly recommend this comedy to families, but be aware that there is a little bit of language and Chenoweth's character does ooze quite a bit of sexuality with her outfits in this film.  Younger children will definitely laugh at the bathroom humor, but there really isn't much for the older members of the family to watch.  Rent this flick before buying it.

This movie was okay, but has none of the hilarious moments from some of Williams' earlier family films like Mrs. Doubtfire and Jumanji.  In fact, most of the jokes seemed to be trying too hard.

Boy was I wrong.It's been a very long time since I've laughed my sides sore at a movie. Based on the saccharine beginning, with daughter Cassy telling her daddy that she never wants to grow up because she doesn't want to leave him behind, I was expecting a sappy family story, too sugary, maybe a few weak laughs. When we fast-forwarded a few years to Cassy as a teenager going through the ""whatever"" stage, I found that it was an uproariously funny farce.Overwhelmed workaholic Bob Munro isn't in it for the money: he's desperate to keep his family in the style to which they've become accustomed. Under pressure from younger men at work, his obnoxious germophobe boss threatens to fire him if he doesn't cancel the family vacation to Hawaii so that he can help secure the merger of Alpine Soda and a smaller, independent company in Colorado. Rather than tell his wife the truth, Bob goes right out and rents an RV. The first inkling that something is up is when daughter Cassie calls, ""Mom! Some idiot just parked a great big RV outside our house!""Reluctantly, the family is persuaded to come along. With Bob needing to generate enough enthusiasm for four people, they get on the road, knocking over most of their wall in the process. There is a great deal of RV-inflicted death and destruction to inanimate objects. Each day they discover the wonders of RV life: the dump station, RV parks that are no more than a patch of desert with a blinking neon cactus, the ""interesting"" neighbors. When Bob can hide away he works on his presentation, but he can't get a connection to the internet. When his laptop is stolen, he has to start over using his Blackberry. The scenes of him climbing all over Utah landscaping to try to get a cellular signal are wonderful.Along the way the family falls in with the Gornickes. Friendly, gushing and more than a little eclectic, at first this family seem like redneck weirdoes. Each scene, however, reveals a little more of what they truly are...and it's not what you'd expect, either. They pick up the hitch hiker who's stolen Bob's laptop, and while they try to return it, the Munros, thinking they're being stalked, run away screaming.I think that the reason this movie is so funny is that its gags are eminently visual. They're over the top, but each one serves a purpose and isn't there ""just because."" There is visual irony in bounds. You don't need to be told that an RV balanced on the point of a hill too steep for something 40&#8242; long is funny. You don't need to be told that overtaking a 12 mph tractor with a 20 mph vehicle is funny. And the dump station scene is beyond compare.The emotions are real and the characters learn from their mistakes and make some progress.

Now father Bob (Robin Williams) is committed to his job always worried that his demanding boss will fire him for a younger, better motivated model.  Teen daughter Cassie (Joanna ""JoJo"" Levesque) wants nothing to do with her uncool father.  And pre-teen son Carl (Josh Hutcherson) is going through a gangster phase.  All this leaves mom Jamie (Cheryl Haines) just trying to hold everything together.The family is looking forward to starting their summer with a vacation to Hawaii, but that changes when Bob's boss Todd (Will Arnett) demands he lead a meeting in Colorado in the middle of the trip.  Instead of explain the situation to his family, he rents a motor home and bills it as a family bonding time.  To say the rest of the family is reluctant is putting it mildly.  To make matters worse, Bob knows nothing about the monster he's rented.  Will they survive the trip to Colorado?  Can Bob work without his family knowing?Do I care?  The answer, honestly, was no.  I grew up camping, so the premise of the movie appealed to me.  But the movie didn't deliver.  Instead of reminding me of warm memories, I was annoyed by all the snipping the characters did at each other.  While the ending was predictable from the first few moments, it was too abrupt for my tastes.The film is also filled with physical comedy.  I mean bathroom humor.  I was constantly cringing at the things that Bob faced.Then there's the stereotypical family the Munros meet along the way as lead by Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth.  I found them more obnoxious than the characters I already didn't like.Frankly, I didn't laugh at this movie once.And the movie is predictable.

Bob, displaying the trademark wisdom of his cinematic ancestors (Steve Martin and Chevy Chase come immediately to mind), decides to juggle both with lies and deceit, the outcome being a series of misadventures that involve a broken parking brake, a family of raccoons, a blocked waste management system, and, of course, a runaway RV.Along the way, Bob and his family encounter the far-too-likeable Gornicke family, a group of RV-lifers, led by a well-meaning man named Travis (played by Jeff Daniels).  The Gornicke's, who are an eerily perfect family, are meant to propel the plot where it lags, and also to help add impetus to the movie's ending, which contains a contrivance so obvious that a blind and deaf man could see it coming.I didn't hate this film.  I, in fact, can see how it might be gently amusing to some people, those who want an ultimately forgettable and formulaic hour-and-a-half diversion.  However, this movie is so paint-by-numbers, its mechanisms are so trite, and all of the characters are so hastily rendered that the whole experience will be pretty boring, even to people who don't expect much.

Apart from that, there's no one really fantastic.I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by JoJo, playing Cassie, she's moved rather quickly into movies (also Aquamarine, which I haven't seen yet), but I think she could be quite successful. She reminded me a lot of Lindsay Lohan before her no knickers antics. She has great comedic timing, and has some of the best lines in the movie. More in the first half of the movie though.

Yes this is disgusting, and you actually pity Robin. It is following on in the tradition of the genre made famous by National Lampoon Vacation movies. The singalong over the end credits was ever so slightly corny, but quite cool. And JoJo shows off her singing ability. God, she's gonna go the same way as Mandy Moore isn't she?

Tresca ""Talien""","[20, 21]","I've read reviews of RV, and they uniformly panned the movie as piffle; humorous tripe that reinforced family values and light humor, wasting the talents of Robin Williams.Give me a break.See, the implication that the family road trip movie is somehow a form of high art is fallacious to begin with.  Although my family (and my wife's family) venerates the National Lampoon vacation movies as the ultimate in comedy, the truth of the matter is it's all a string of silly gags and ridiculous foils.  It takes real skill to play a perpetually optimistic patriarch in the face of modern indignities and family squabbles.  If anything, the family road trip movie is really just a condensed version of half the sitcoms on television.  And there's a reason those sitcoms are still around, even though the critics patiently explain over and over how dumb they are.They're right.  It IS dumb.  But then, so is having to deal with the inanities of modern life. RV is merely an update of a long established tradition of pitting a man (Bob Munro played by Robin Williams), his hot wife (Cheryl Hines), his teenage daughter (Joanna Levesque) and pre-teen son (Josh Hutcherson) against the world and seeing who comes out on top. And we root for Bob all the way.What makes RV so appealing is that it doesn't deviate at all from the formula but cleverly updates all the trials and tribulations.  Bob's affection for his adorable daughter at two years old is sharply contrasted by her wisecracking personality as a teenager.  How many parents stare at their kids and wonder what happened to the darling who never wanted to leave their side? Bob's career hinges on finishing a presentation, and much of the movie is taken up with his personal struggle to find a signal for his Blackberry.  Road warriors feel his pain.  And as an older, funnier man, Bob constantly has to watch his back as younger, inexperienced climbers try to steal the spotlight.In short, the Monroe struggles are the new struggles of the middle class. Sure, Clark Griswold didn't have these problems, but then the National Lampoon movies were made decades ago.  RV brings it all up to date with one difference: unlike Cousin Eddie and his brood, the country folk are actually the wiser and more decent family. We could learn a lot from their home values, preaches Brother Sonnenfeld.  Maybe he's right.When RV was playing at my parents' house, we were waiting for my brother to join us to watch a DVD.

999638,AGCJDJH2CTDD9,B000G8O0MK,Mike Zimmerman,"[0, 0]","Bob Munro (Robin Williams) has received lukewarm reception from his family: his wife (Cheryl Hines), his rebellious punk daughter (JoJo), and his rap-loving son (Josh Hutcherson). Though his his proposal for the whole family to hit the road sounds like a heartfelt bid to get better acquainted with his increasingly dysfunctional family, it soon becomes obvious that he had more career-oriented goals in mind when planning the trip. The Munros have always managed to get by in the past, though, and as they slowly become immersed in RV culture with a little help from a full-time troupe of Winnebago warriors (Jeff Daniels and Kristen Chenowith), they might just make it to the Rocky Mountains without driving each other totally insane.Director Barry Sonnenfield has been responsible for a couple hits in the past, which include the adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ""Get Shorty,"" the sci-fi action comedy ""Men In Black,"" and the horrendously underrated ensemble comedy ""Big Trouble."" For his latest opus, he has studied the ""Vacation"" franchise, this time replacing Chevy Chase with wildman Robin Williams who hasn't seen in a live-action comedy since ""Death to Smoochy."" It's a good idea, because without his comic timing, ""R.V."" would've been a stinker.Speaking of which, Sonnenfield somehow has a bizarre fetish with flatulence humor, like Les Mayfield did with last year's bomb ""The Man."" I did enjoy Robin Williams get splattered with fecal matter (as he puts it bluntly), but when he has to pretend he's moving his bowels in a forest, it's a scene so gratuitous, you wonder if the screenwriters could've used more of a goofier touch. Not to the director: ""Do not try this type of humor unless you are Mel Brooks."" Still, you have to applaud Williams, because the man gets off on several hilarious scenes. He even makes some lame jokes actually work (such as his attempts to get a clear signal so the connection on his cellphone or laptop can be completed). The biggest laughs will come when he winds up in the front of the runaway RV. It doesn't hurt that Cheryl Hines gets mileage when singing ""G.T.O."" Co-stars Daniels and Chenowith (whose chest looks like its about to pop out; risky for a PG rating, DAMN!) make the most of the time on their screen with Southen charms and wild humor.But I need to ask whoever thought JoJo would be appealing. While the pop singer had a breakout success in the little-seen ""Aquamarine,"" here she's acting like a quasi-Lindsay Lohan clone: she thinks she's funny, but in reality, HELL NO! All she's given are lame retorts to her dad. As soon as she begins the opening line (""Dad, could you be any lamer?""), you'd wonder if the movie should've made a while back when Amanda Bynes was a tween.Regardless, ""R.V."" is a good family comedy that I'm sure everyone will like. It's only until the third act that Sonnenfield goes cold turkey and adds that family film sentiment so no one is harmed. Seriously, after watching Williams get doused with poop, caught in a headlock by Daniels, and M.I.A. during unnecessary subplots (the kids fall in love - who expected that?), that's the last thing you would think about. Oh well, at least the funnyman makes that up with the howler ""Whenever a big white man picks up a banjo, my cheeks tighten.""

""Cheaper By The Dozen"" and ""The Pink Panther"" are just stupid, cheap whores - begging to be liked, they stoop for approval. Now, yes, ""RV"" involves a scene with a backed-up sewage drain full of human waste splashing all over the body of Robin Williams. But this joke develops over ten minutes, with director Barry Sonnenfeld stretching the inevitable climax out as if he were Michael Mann. The movie gets some perverse pride in working against its own genre. It thuds like a Scud, man.On the surface it's a pitiful retread of the ""National Lampoon"" vacation series without the adult humor or Chevy Chase. Williams (in his pensive, borderline perverse mode) is Bob, an adman under a jerky dictator boss who wants him to make a presentation in Colorado, which gives Bob the chance to shove his family aboard a rented camper and bond. What follows is a road picture with few episodes, little color, and something resembling restraint. This'll sound strange, but the cinematography, featuring the desert Southwest, is vibrant and clear, lovely and perfectly pointless, adding a visual texture that does nothing but make the movie's budget $65 million instead of, say, $25 million.It does not help that Sonnenfeld (""Men In Black,"" The Addams Family"") strives for accuracy in making Bob's wife (Cheryl Hines) and daughter (singer Jojo) a pair of shrill, yipping harpies. The movie's first hour requires them, literally, to bray, scold, wince, screw up their faces, whine and act as rotten and inhospitable as they possibly can. They share a saying: ""We're not that friendly!"" Yep. ""RV"" continues a trend in movies and TV where guys like Ray Romano, Jim Belushi and Williams try to toe some meticulous-yet-capriciously drawn line by the women in their lives as they - ha, ha, ha - stumble around, hide and suffocate themselves. Personally, I never found MacBeth's wife all that funny.And then there's Jeff Daniels, fresh off ""The Squid and The Whale,"" humiliating himself for a paycheck as a redneck patriarch driving his family cross-country on a bus. Bob also encounters some other people played by actors you don't know in scenes you won't remember.

Although it follows the same theme of a family on a disastrous vacation, it is unique enough to stand on its own.Bob Munro (Robin Williams) has a vacation obligation to his family while his job tells him to cancel all plans because of a big merger.  Bob decides to drive to Denver, to his merger meeting, in a rented RV in lieu of a Hawaii vacation he promised his family.  The fun starts the minute Bob tries to pull the behemoth out of his own driveway.The majority of the movie is very predictable, but manages to stay fresh due to the acting skills of the cast and an innovative and creative script.  With Robin Williams as Bob Munro, Cheryl Hines as his wife Jamie, and Jeff Daniels (Dumb & Dumber) as the obnoxious ""RV Neighbor"" Travis Gornicke and his wife Mary Jo (expertly played by Kristin Chenoweth), the movie is set for comedy at its very best.It's just one silly stunt after another, with a rented RV that doesn't have much for an emergency brake.  Bob tries to save his family and his career at the same time, and in the end, he is forced to make a choice.There are a lot of very funny moments in this movie, reminiscent not only of 'Vacation' movies but also the classic 'Long, Long Trailer' with Lucille Ball.  Add a little bit of 'Road Trip' nastiness, and you have 'RV'.If you liked Chevy Chase's 'Vacation' series with Beverly D'Angelo, you will love Robin Williams and Cheryl Hines in this soon-to-be-classic comedy.

Robin William's comedy `RV' has no groundbreaking idea as far as its content goes, but the film is pleasant and often funny.Ironically ""pleasant"" comes not from the main characters - Bob Munro (Robin Williams) who takes his family not to Hawaii as originally planned, but to Colorado with his disgruntled children in tow. Actually in Colorado there is a business meeting for the merger of his company, but Bob uses a RV trip as cover-up, hiding a lap-top PC with which he writes his presentation planning secretly at night.Even with the charisma of Robin Williams, the main story fails to interest us. It surely works as a set-up for several comic adventures, though; Bob fights the wild raccoons, Bob does hip-hop impersonation, and so on. It is good to see Robin Williams doing comedies, but perhaps someone else could have done the same old jokes we have seen before.The real pleasantness and laughter come from the supports, Jeff Daniels and Kristin Chenoweth playing super-happy dad and mom of the Gornickes. The original script might have intended these Partridge family-like characters as send-up (with `Star Trek' horn of their RV), but director Barry Sonnenfeld, who did two `The Addams Family' films in the past, clearly likes this strange but lovable family better than the Munro family. Sonnenfeld'd quirky taste is more suitable for showing the values of the free-and-easy Gornickes, which might explain somewhat flat and uninspired story about the Munro family.`RV' is no masterpiece, and perhaps better than its reputation though you may think you have seen this one before somewhere (with Chevy Chase in it).",3,Robin Williams in a RV Road Movie: Funny But Could Be Much Funnier,1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,1744,"['Dysfunctional', 'family', 'traveling', 'RV', 'newly', 'established', 'bond', 'various', 'misadventures', 'Robin', 'William', 'comedy', 'RV', 'groundbreaking', 'idea', 'as', 'far', 'content', 'film', 'pleasant', 'often', 'funny.Ironically', 'pleasant', 'not', 'main', 'characters', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'family', 'not', 'Hawaii', 'originally', 'planned', 'Colorado', 'disgruntled', 'children', 'tow', 'Actually', 'Colorado', 'business', 'meeting', 'merger', 'company', 'Bob', 'RV', 'trip', 'cover-up', 'hiding', 'lap-top', 'PC', 'presentation', 'planning', 'secretly', 'night.Even', 'charisma', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'main', 'story', 'interest', 'surely', 'set-up', 'several', 'comic', 'adventures', 'Bob', 'wild', 'raccoons', 'Bob', 'hip-hop', 'impersonation', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'doing', 'comedies', 'perhaps', 'someone', 'else', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'same', 'old', 'jokes', 'have', 'seen', 'before.The', 'real', 'pleasantness', 'laughter', 'come', 'supports', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'Kristin', 'Chenoweth', 'playing', 'super-happy', 'dad', 'mom', 'Gornickes', 'original', 'script', 'might', 'have', 'intended', 'Partridge', 'family-like', 'characters', 'send-up', 'Star', 'Trek', 'horn', 'RV', 'director', 'Barry', 'Sonnenfeld', 'who', 'did', 'two', 'Addams', 'Family', 'films', 'past', 'clearly', 'strange', 'lovable', 'family', 'better', 'Munro', 'family', 'Sonnenfeld', ""'d"", 'quirky', 'taste', 'more', 'suitable', 'showing', 'values', 'free-and-easy', 'Gornickes', 'might', 'explain', 'somewhat', 'flat', 'uninspired', 'story', 'Munro', 'family.', 'RV', 'masterpiece', 'perhaps', 'better', 'reputation', 'may', 'think', 'have', 'seen', 'one', 'somewhere', 'Chevy', 'Chase']",N/A

You either tell him to ""do his thing"" and let the cameras roll, or you make him cut the comedy altogether and be serious (see: Awakenings), which can also be very effective.  However, ""RV"" tries to have the best of both worlds and fails miserably.For a basic plot summary, ""RV"" sees Bob Munro (Williams) takes his wife (Cheryl Hines), son (Josh Hutcherson), and daughter (Jo-Jo Levesque) on an RV vacation to try and rekindle the family bond.  Along the way, they run into the Gornicke family (led by Jeff Daniels) and get caught up in all sorts of crazy shenanigans.There could be multiple ways to analyze this movie, but what it really all boils down to is that the jokes are just not very funny.  The children are such caricatures that no real emotional is possible, while Robin Williams just seems to be trying too hard throughout.  Really, the only funny scenes in this one revolve around Mr. Daniels, who truly does steal whatever is left of this show.That, in truth, is really all there is to say about ""RV"".  If you're going to make a comedy, it has to be funny (or at least have a target audience).  This one does neither and thus ends up being both stupid and shallow, with the germ of emotion at the core of the script never really drawing us into the characters.  This one can easily be skipped unless watching with children (about the only demographic it will grab hold of at all).",1,Robin Williams Fails At Formula Once Again,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",2012,1542,"['fans', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'comedic', 'style', 'one', 'formula', 'never', 'work', 'cinema', 'ca', ""n't"", 'formula-ize', 'comedy', 'either', 'tell', 'do', 'thing', 'let', 'cameras', 'roll', 'make', 'cut', 'comedy', 'altogether', 'be', 'serious', 'see', 'Awakenings', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'effective', 'However', 'RV', 'tries', 'have', 'best', 'worlds', 'fails', 'miserably.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'RV', 'Bob', 'Munro', 'Williams', 'wife', 'Cheryl', 'Hines', 'son', 'Josh', 'Hutcherson', 'daughter', 'Jo-Jo', 'Levesque', 'RV', 'vacation', 'try', 'rekindle', 'family', 'bond', 'way', 'run', 'Gornicke', 'family', 'led', 'Jeff', 'Daniels', 'get', 'caught', 'up', 'sorts', 'crazy', 'shenanigans.There', 'could', 'be', 'multiple', 'ways', 'analyze', 'movie', 'what', 'really', 'boils', 'down', 'jokes', 'are', 'just', 'not', 'very', 'funny', 'children', 'are', 'such', 'caricatures', 'real', 'emotional', 'possible', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'just', 'be', 'trying', 'too', 'hard', 'Really', 'only', 'funny', 'scenes', 'one', 'revolve', 'Mr.', 'Daniels', 'who', 'truly', 'steal', 'left', 'show.That', 'truth', 'really', 'say', 'RV', ""'re"", 'going', 'make', 'comedy', 'be', 'funny', 'least', 'have', 'target', 'audience', 'one', 'thus', 'up', 'being', 'stupid', 'shallow', 'germ', 'emotion', 'core', 'script', 'never', 'really', 'drawing', 'characters', 'one', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'skipped', 'watching', 'children', 'only', 'demographic', 'will', 'grab', 'hold']",N/A
