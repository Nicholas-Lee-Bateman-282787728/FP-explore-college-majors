1666618,A18Y4W7FJHUT9X,B00ECGEGGM,Amazon Customer,"[21, 27]","I loved the Burn Notice T.V. series. It kind of reminded me of the old 1980s A-Team T.V. series with a spy twist. That is probably why I like it so much :) The typical episode dealt with spy type activities but the major objective was for Michael Westen to clear his name (with the help of his team) after being discredited by the CIA. There are occasional voice overs by Westen giving advice regarding tactics and equipment which give more insight into what the whole team is doing or thinking. I won't spoil anything but I thought the series finale was well done, like the rest of the series.",5,Fantastic Spy drama,1379289600,"09 16, 2013",2013,594,"['loved', 'Burn', 'Notice', 'T.V', 'series', 'kind', 'reminded', 'old', '1980s', 'A-Team', 'T.V', 'series', 'spy', 'twist', 'probably', 'why', 'like', 'so', 'much', 'typical', 'episode', 'dealt', 'spy', 'type', 'activities', 'major', 'objective', 'was', 'Michael', 'Westen', 'clear', 'name', 'help', 'team', 'being', 'discredited', 'CIA', 'are', 'occasional', 'voice', 'overs', 'Westen', 'giving', 'advice', 'regarding', 'tactics', 'equipment', 'give', 'more', 'insight', 'what', 'whole', 'team', 'doing', 'thinking', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anything', 'thought', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'well', 'done', 'rest', 'series']",Burn Notice: The Complete Series

1666636,AYP5082JDMAHL,B00ECGEGGM,Ryjacork,"[76, 86]","Bullets are boring. You see bullets on every television show these days. Anybody can win a fight with bullets. Beating your enemy with duct tape however, that's a move only Michael Weston can accomplish. Who is Michael Weston you ask? Well, he used to be a spy, until they burned him. After losing his job, his money, and all his resources, and being stranded in Miami, Michael Weston has vowed to use his skills as a spy to help those in need, as well as to bring down the evil, quasi government agency responsible for destroying his life. Helping Michael along his journey is his sexy, gun running, on again off again girlfriend, and former bomb maker for the IRA, Fiona Glenanne. There's also Michael's best friend, a former Navy Seal named Sam Axe. Eventually they are also joined by another burned spy named Jesse Porter. In addition to the main team, there is also Michael's neurotic (and surprisingly badass) elderly mother, a metrosexual money launderer named Berry, and Michael's screw up brother Nate.In addition to a fantastic cast, Burn Notice has become famous for its very unique MacGuyver like fight sequences. Whether they're making a rocket launcher out of a pipe and soda cans, a claymore mine out of a microwave and some silverware, or a tracking/listening device out of a tiny pink cell phone, there's just something immensely satisfying about watching Mikey and his crew deal with their enemies via a combination of making weapons out of household objects, advanced special forces hand to hand combat, and general cleverness. More than anything else our heroes outfox their enemies into destroying themselves.Burn Notice is a great show to just sit back and enjoy the fun fight scenes, the funny moments, and the touching ones as well. And all seven seasons for just a touch over 100$ is an absolute bargain.
