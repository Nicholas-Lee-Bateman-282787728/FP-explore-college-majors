This DVD version is 122 minutes and my copy says it is from Lions Gate, not Front Row.I don't particularly like this film, nor this version of the Harry Palmer character (incidently, even though it suggests otherwise, this has nothing to do with anything written by Len Deighton). I know it's a bit like that old joke where someone complains about how terrible food in a restauramt is, and then also complains that the portions are too small.

666395,AYBL30P5NXNZ4,B00005MM68,"Mr. Stephen Kennedy ""skenn1701a""","[1, 2]","Michael Caine filmed this made for TV movie in the mid 90's, back to back with Midnight in St. Petersburg.  Harry Palmer has been unceremoniously ousted from the Secret Service.. but finds a private contract to recover a stolen biological agent, for a mysterious but powerfully connected Russian, played by Michael Gambon.  The journey to find this bio-agent and understand who is doing what to who and why, takes us on the titular train from Russia to Beijing.  The story is frankly hard to swallow on many levels, and is woefully disappointing if you come expecting the flair of theThe Ipcress File [Blu-ray] orFuneral In Berlin.  In the absence of Len Deighton's involvement, the screenwriter has tried to emulate the intricacies of a convoluted spy thriller with double crosses and twists.. and only succeeded in tying himself up in knots and ultimately losing all credibility.  Although there are plenty of action scenes dispersed throughout the movie, there is nothing outstanding, merely workmanlike, and it plays more like a pilot to a TV series than a standalone movie.  As for the hero, for a seasoned spy, Palmer seems to do little more than get carried along by events and go around asking old friends and near strangers what they know, when he needs a lead.  Jason Connery feels like stunt casting designed to remind you of his dad, but he betrays no emotion.. I've seen garden shrubs that made more compulsive viewing.. and Mia Sara also does little to further her career.  It's only Michael Caine that frankly makes this at all worth watching - that and the genuine locations.  There's an oddly out of place music score by Rick Wakeman of all people.There's a pleasure to be had in seeing Caine play Palmer again.. it's something about nostalgia.  Watching this is sort of like going back and rewatching some of your favourite 70's or 80's tv shows.. you know they're really not very good, but it reminds you about enjoying them, once.. and it puts a smile on your face.  Here, we get to see Caine in action in a story which while not perfect, will pass some time for you if you are in the mood for undemanding entertainment.  By the end of it though, when you hear the hints that the next one is on its way, you'll probably be inclined like me to think enough is enough.. goodwill only goes so far, in covering up wooden acting and dodgy production values.",2,Low budget entry to the Palmer franchise,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,2372,"['Michael', 'Caine', 'filmed', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'mid', '90', 'back', 'back', 'Midnight', 'St.', 'Petersburg', 'Harry', 'Palmer', 'been', 'unceremoniously', 'ousted', 'Secret', 'Service..', 'private', 'contract', 'recover', 'stolen', 'biological', 'agent', 'mysterious', 'powerfully', 'connected', 'Russian', 'played', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'journey', 'find', 'bio-agent', 'understand', 'who', 'doing', 'what', 'who', 'why', 'titular', 'train', 'Russia', 'Beijing', 'story', 'frankly', 'hard', 'swallow', 'many', 'levels', 'woefully', 'disappointing', 'come', 'expecting', 'flair', 'theThe', 'Ipcress', 'File', '[', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'orFuneral', 'Berlin', 'absence', 'Len', 'Deighton', 'involvement', 'screenwriter', 'tried', 'emulate', 'intricacies', 'convoluted', 'spy', 'thriller', 'double', 'crosses', 'twists..', 'only', 'succeeded', 'tying', 'up', 'knots', 'ultimately', 'losing', 'credibility', 'are', 'plenty', 'action', 'scenes', 'dispersed', 'movie', 'nothing', 'outstanding', 'merely', 'workmanlike', 'more', 'pilot', 'TV', 'series', 'standalone', 'movie', 'hero', 'seasoned', 'spy', 'Palmer', 'do', 'little', 'more', 'get', 'carried', 'events', 'go', 'around', 'asking', 'old', 'friends', 'strangers', 'what', 'know', 'when', 'lead', 'Jason', 'Connery', 'feels', 'stunt', 'casting', 'designed', 'remind', 'dad', 'emotion..', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'garden', 'shrubs', 'made', 'more', 'compulsive', 'viewing..', 'Mia', 'Sara', 'also', 'little', 'further', 'career', 'only', 'Michael', 'Caine', 'frankly', 'worth', 'watching', 'genuine', 'locations', 'oddly', 'place', 'music', 'score', 'Rick', 'Wakeman', 'pleasure', 'be', 'had', 'seeing', 'Caine', 'play', 'Palmer', 'something', 'nostalgia', 'Watching', 'sort', 'going', 'back', 'rewatching', 'favourite', '70', '80', 'tv', 'shows..', 'know', ""'re"", 'really', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'enjoying', 'once..', 'smile', 'face', 'Here', 'get', 'see', 'Caine', 'action', 'story', 'not', 'perfect', 'will', 'pass', 'time', 'are', 'mood', 'undemanding', 'entertainment', 'end', 'when', 'hear', 'hints', 'next', 'one', 'way', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'inclined', 'think', 'enough', 'enough..', 'goodwill', 'only', 'so', 'far', 'covering', 'up', 'wooden', 'acting', 'dodgy', 'production', 'values']",N/A
