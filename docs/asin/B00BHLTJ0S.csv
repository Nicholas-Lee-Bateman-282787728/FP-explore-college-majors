From the very beginning of the Nazi Party through in-depth looks at the Gulf War and the bombing of Iraq, it leaves nothing to the imagination. And might I add, not being a fan of Charlton Heston, an NRA Spokesperson, he did a credible job on his narration of this series. I could sit here and write detail after detail of this collection but why read what I think of it when you can have it for yourself. You will love and cherish this series.",5,A Lifetime of War,1404259200,"07 2, 2014",2014,515,"['are', 'student', 'WWII', 'history', 'collection', 'very', 'beginning', 'Nazi', 'Party', 'in-depth', 'looks', 'Gulf', 'War', 'bombing', 'Iraq', 'nothing', 'imagination', 'might', 'add', 'not', 'being', 'fan', 'Charlton', 'Heston', 'NRA', 'Spokesperson', 'did', 'credible', 'job', 'narration', 'series', 'could', 'sit', 'here', 'write', 'detail', 'detail', 'collection', 'why', 'read', 'what', 'think', 'when', 'can', 'have', 'will', 'love', 'cherish', 'series']",Secrets of War - Espionage - 10 Episodes
1634705,A2POT13FER5L82,B00BHLTJ0S,it,"[2, 6]","This series is generally good, but it white washes blunders made by British and American intelligence. One example is that the German generals wanted to know if the Allies would stop the war if they killed Hitler and stopped the war from their side. This series fails to report this information and says that the Allies ignoring the advances of the generals was no loss because there was no armed resistance units in Germany. This is illogical. It was the generals that would stop the war, not armed groups fighting against a government that was continuing the war.Another problem is that they do not give credit to assistance they got from other countries. Polish intelligence obtained an enigma machine and set their engineers and mathematicians to analyze it several years before the war. They gave the machine and the analysis results to the British. This series gives all of the code breaking credit to the British.Yet another thing is that A. J. P. Taylor, the famous war historian, said that the cost of running SOE was vastly more than the value of damage done to the German war effort. It was a misuse of scarce resources.",4,some problems,1366502400,"04 21, 2013",2013,1131,"['series', 'generally', 'good', 'white', 'washes', 'blunders', 'made', 'British', 'American', 'intelligence', 'One', 'example', 'German', 'generals', 'wanted', 'know', 'Allies', 'would', 'stop', 'war', 'killed', 'Hitler', 'stopped', 'war', 'side', 'series', 'report', 'information', 'Allies', 'ignoring', 'advances', 'generals', 'was', 'loss', 'was', 'armed', 'resistance', 'units', 'Germany', 'illogical', 'was', 'generals', 'would', 'stop', 'war', 'not', 'armed', 'groups', 'fighting', 'government', 'was', 'continuing', 'war.Another', 'problem', 'do', 'not', 'give', 'credit', 'assistance', 'got', 'other', 'countries', 'Polish', 'intelligence', 'obtained', 'enigma', 'machine', 'set', 'engineers', 'mathematicians', 'analyze', 'several', 'years', 'war', 'gave', 'machine', 'analysis', 'results', 'British', 'series', 'code', 'breaking', 'credit', 'British.Yet', 'thing', 'A.', 'J.', 'P.', 'Taylor', 'famous', 'war', 'historian', 'said', 'cost', 'running', 'SOE', 'was', 'vastly', 'more', 'value', 'damage', 'done', 'German', 'war', 'effort', 'was', 'misuse', 'scarce', 'resources']",Secrets of War - Espionage - 10 Episodes
