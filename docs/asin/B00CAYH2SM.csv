1645286,A2VMT89TCSF105,B00CAYH2SM,"Ashtar Command ""Seeker""","[5, 9]","SPOILER WARNING, SPOILER WARNING""Eve of Destruction"" was originally a mini-series for television, now released as a full-length film. This ""disaster movie"" features, among others, Aleks Paunovic, Treat Williams and Steven Weber. The plot pits unscrupulous profiteers, duped scientists and nave eco-radicals against each other in a race against time to save our planet from complete destruction as an experiment with ""dark energy"" goes terribly wrong.Despite its annoying stereotypes, ""Eve of Destruction"" is a tolerable action/drama movie...for about one hour. Then the characters just gets too stereotyped, the plot too illogical, and the tempo too slow-paced. Imagine a slow-paced film featuring the death of 500,000 people in the city of Denver...Boooom!Note also the subtle anti-environmentalist message. The eco-radicals are terrorists and call themselves Occupy the World. They, too, are somehow to blame for the explosion of the Mad Scientist Generator. In the end, the duped scientists and the sweet little eco-terrorist Ruby (who just wanted to save the planet and get a boyfriend) hug each other, since we are all to blame, blah blah.Yepp, doesn't that just break your heart. As a concession to reality, the real crooks get away in the end, planning to build a new ""dark energy"" reactor somewhere in the Third World instead...Only two stars, Mr. Covert Brownlash.",2,Sweet little Ruby wants to save the world,1372809600,"07 3, 2013",2013,1373,"['SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'Eve', 'Destruction', 'was', 'originally', 'mini-series', 'television', 'now', 'released', 'full-length', 'film', 'disaster', 'movie', 'features', 'others', 'Aleks', 'Paunovic', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'Steven', 'Weber', 'plot', 'unscrupulous', 'profiteers', 'duped', 'scientists', 'nave', 'eco-radicals', 'other', 'race', 'time', 'save', 'planet', 'complete', 'destruction', 'experiment', 'dark', 'energy', 'terribly', 'wrong.Despite', 'annoying', 'stereotypes', 'Eve', 'Destruction', 'tolerable', 'action/drama', 'movie', 'one', 'hour', 'Then', 'characters', 'just', 'too', 'stereotyped', 'plot', 'too', 'illogical', 'tempo', 'too', 'slow-paced', 'Imagine', 'slow-paced', 'film', 'featuring', 'death', '500,000', 'people', 'city', 'Denver', 'Boooom', 'Note', 'also', 'subtle', 'anti-environmentalist', 'message', 'eco-radicals', 'are', 'terrorists', 'call', 'World', 'too', 'are', 'somehow', 'blame', 'explosion', 'Mad', 'Scientist', 'Generator', 'end', 'duped', 'scientists', 'sweet', 'little', 'eco-terrorist', 'Ruby', 'who', 'just', 'wanted', 'save', 'planet', 'get', 'boyfriend', 'hug', 'other', 'are', 'blame', 'blah', 'blah.Yepp', ""n't"", 'that', 'just', 'break', 'heart', 'concession', 'reality', 'real', 'crooks', 'get', 'away', 'end', 'planning', 'build', 'new', 'dark', 'energy', 'reactor', 'somewhere', 'Third', 'World', 'instead', 'Only', 'two', 'stars', 'Mr.', 'Covert', 'Brownlash']",Eve of Destruction

1645292,A16XRPF40679KG,B00CAYH2SM,Michael Dobey,"[4, 5]","this is like many disaster tv mini series you have seen before. However this one does feature very good special effects and a different twist. They attempt to use dark matter to create energy. Dark matter wasn't even known until recently. It's the invisible substance that holds the universe together and holds our galaxy in place.  without it , we'd spin off into space.  it's all around us but we can't see it. and is subatomic maybe. So this is a new twist in doctor who in 1970 , they attempt to drill to the center of the earth. And like that show it goes all wrong here , only on a huge scale.  the Acting is done is a serious manner and is lead by the excellent steven weber , in the lead place. Treat Williams is very good as the likeable but totally corrupt businessman villain, and the rest of the cast do a fine job. This was shown on reelz here and it was made in Canada. Although it takes place in Denver, Colorado. Which actually does have a radioactive sight near it! Denver also has allowed frakking nearby which has done damage to peoples lives as well. So this place being near Denver makes sense.  I saw this in Hd, so that's the way to see it. On dvd it will look good but not near as good as hd. There are many scenes that are really well done in hd and the sets are impressive. WIll they save the world? , well this is a better show than some made for tv films for sure, watch it and find out.",4,good tv mini series.,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,1415,"['many', 'disaster', 'tv', 'mini', 'series', 'have', 'seen', 'However', 'one', 'feature', 'very', 'good', 'special', 'effects', 'different', 'twist', 'attempt', 'use', 'dark', 'matter', 'create', 'energy', 'Dark', 'matter', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'known', 'recently', 'invisible', 'substance', 'universe', 'together', 'galaxy', 'place', ""'d"", 'spin', 'off', 'space', 'ca', ""n't"", 'see', 'subatomic', 'maybe', 'new', 'twist', 'doctor', 'who', '1970', 'attempt', 'drill', 'center', 'earth', 'show', 'all', 'wrong', 'here', 'only', 'huge', 'scale', 'Acting', 'done', 'serious', 'manner', 'lead', 'excellent', 'steven', 'weber', 'lead', 'place', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'very', 'good', 'likeable', 'totally', 'corrupt', 'businessman', 'villain', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'was', 'shown', 'reelz', 'here', 'was', 'made', 'Canada', 'place', 'Denver', 'Colorado', 'Which', 'actually', 'have', 'radioactive', 'sight', 'Denver', 'also', 'allowed', 'frakking', 'nearby', 'done', 'damage', 'peoples', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'place', 'being', 'Denver', 'sense', 'saw', 'Hd', 'way', 'see', 'dvd', 'will', 'look', 'good', 'not', 'as', 'good', 'hd', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'hd', 'sets', 'are', 'impressive', 'save', 'world', 'well', 'better', 'show', 'made', 'tv', 'films', 'sure', 'watch', 'find', 'out']",Eve of Destruction
