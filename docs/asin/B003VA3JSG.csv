This beginning part of the story is thrilling and will put you on the edge of your seat but it's the next part that really holds the heart of the film.  Alexandra returns to her little hometown to escape the dangers of her city life.  We see her interact with her father (delightfully acted by Peter Musevski), an aged rocker trying to pull his life together after his wife left him for a man she was having an affair with.  Nina Ivanisin as Alexandra goes deep into the role, keeping up a strong and unfazed facade as everything around her is volatile and threatening.

1366781,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B003VA3JSG,Andres C. Salama,"[10, 11]","A 23 year old Slovenian girl, originally from a small town there but now studying at the university in the capital of Ljubljana, supplements her life as a student with stints as a prostitute (to show how distasteful her job is, the filmmakers have all her clients to be fat and/or old). One of them is a famous politician, and when he dies of a heart attack when he was in a hotel room with her, she flees not before telling the police. She is soon searched by the authorities and by the news media as the mysterious Slovenian Girl. She is also on the run from two sleazy, violent pimps, who want her to work for them instead of independently. A former boyfriend is stalking her also, and her mother back in her hometown doesn't look too happy when she shows up for a visit. Only her rock musician father and a female friend (who are obviously ignorant of her side job) are there supporting her. And all of the time she's having money problems, including coming with money to pay for a loan she incurred in to buy an apartment.To me the movie works best as a showcase of the general aimlessness of many young people today, especially in the developed world. Without any spiritual or political belief, many young people today seem to fall into nihilism. The main actress is pretty, but it seems to me to be way too surly to be a prostitute. Shouldn't she at least feign she is a sweet girl in front of her clients (this is not a criticism of her acting, she clearly has been told to play her that way by the filmmakers). Alas, this surliness of her makes the audience not care too much of what happens to her.

1366782,A1S3C5OFU508P3,B003VA3JSG,Charles Ashbacher,"[1, 1]","The plot of this movie is one that has been common down through history and frequently happens in recent times. A young girl moves from a small town into the big city, in this case Ljubljana, Slovenia and finds herself wanting to live better than her means allow. Alexandra is studying English at a university and thinks that she is a strong and independent woman. In order to have all that she wants, Alex becomes a call girl by night, earning enough to purchase a higher quality apartment.Her descent into prostitution leads her into a life of fear when two men threaten to kill her if they are not allowed to become her pimps. Alex goes back to her small town of origin to visit her father and we are given some background on her life. Her father has very little and apparently that is the case with most of his friends. Yet he is proud of his daughter for going off to school, considering her one of the few good things in his life.Alex's relationship with her mother is essentially non-existent, their one encounter starts and ends badly with no higher points in-between. Alex also appears to be someone that made few friends in her hometown, leaving her with nothing in the way of support structure. She also had a relationship with a man that divorced his wife in order to be with Alex, only to discover that she has no real interest in him.When the men are threatening Alex, you feel sympathy for her, yet her lying to everyone from her professor to her father to her banker really turns the viewer off. She is a very cold animal; Alex appears devoid of humor, compassion or any form of emotional warmth. If she has a passion for anything, it is for cigarettes.This is a movie lacking in heroes or hope, the people in Alex's hometown all seem depressed and devoid of opportunity. Even when people offer Alex companionship, she dismisses it except when she is in dire need of help. A look into the dark side of human existence, this is not a movie that will uplift your spirits. Yet it is very well done, Nina Ivanisin is excellent as the brooding, calculating Alex. What makes this movie great is not that it is fun to watch but that it is a description of the lives of so many women throughout time and around the world. The best movies with dark themes are those that are realistic and believable and this one is both.",5,A dark movie that is very well acted and represents the life many people have in post-communist eastern Europe,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",2013,2328,"['plot', 'movie', 'one', 'been', 'common', 'down', 'history', 'frequently', 'recent', 'times', 'young', 'girl', 'moves', 'small', 'town', 'big', 'city', 'case', 'Ljubljana', 'Slovenia', 'wanting', 'live', 'better', 'means', 'allow', 'Alexandra', 'studying', 'English', 'university', 'strong', 'independent', 'woman', 'order', 'have', 'Alex', 'call', 'girl', 'night', 'earning', 'enough', 'purchase', 'higher', 'quality', 'apartment.Her', 'descent', 'prostitution', 'life', 'fear', 'when', 'two', 'men', 'threaten', 'kill', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'become', 'pimps', 'Alex', 'back', 'small', 'town', 'origin', 'visit', 'father', 'are', 'given', 'background', 'life', 'father', 'very', 'little', 'apparently', 'case', 'most', 'friends', 'proud', 'daughter', 'going', 'off', 'school', 'considering', 'one', 'few', 'good', 'things', 'life.Alex', 'relationship', 'mother', 'essentially', 'non-existent', 'one', 'encounter', 'badly', 'higher', 'points', 'in-between', 'Alex', 'also', 'be', 'someone', 'made', 'few', 'friends', 'hometown', 'leaving', 'nothing', 'way', 'support', 'structure', 'also', 'had', 'relationship', 'man', 'divorced', 'wife', 'order', 'be', 'Alex', 'only', 'discover', 'real', 'interest', 'men', 'are', 'threatening', 'Alex', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'yet', 'lying', 'everyone', 'professor', 'father', 'banker', 'really', 'viewer', 'off', 'very', 'cold', 'animal', 'Alex', 'devoid', 'humor', 'compassion', 'form', 'emotional', 'warmth', 'passion', 'anything', 'cigarettes.This', 'movie', 'lacking', 'heroes', 'hope', 'people', 'Alex', 'hometown', 'seem', 'depressed', 'devoid', 'opportunity', 'Even', 'when', 'people', 'offer', 'Alex', 'companionship', 'when', 'dire', 'need', 'help', 'look', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'existence', 'not', 'movie', 'will', 'uplift', 'spirits', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'Nina', 'Ivanisin', 'excellent', 'brooding', 'calculating', 'Alex', 'What', 'movie', 'great', 'not', 'fun', 'watch', 'description', 'lives', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'time', 'world', 'best', 'movies', 'dark', 'themes', 'are', 'are', 'realistic', 'believable', 'one']",N/A
1366783,AN9J46667D80O,B003VA3JSG,"Chris Swanson ""I'm just this guy, you know?""","[13, 17]","(special thanks to Film Movement for providing me with a screener!)Prostitution is often described as the world's oldest profession. At various points in history its been banned, praised and made into a form of worship. These days it simply is what it is, and for at least some people, it's a viable way to make money.One of those people is featured in this latest release from Film Movement. The film is a drama about a young woman, Alexandra (Nina Ivanisin), who has escaped small town life and is now a student living in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. She wants to have a certain kind of lifestyle and that lifestyle requires more money than a student might normally have. So like many attractive people before her, she figures that she might as well start selling sex to get the life she wants.At first things seem to be going quite well for her, and she's soon raking in enough money to buy a small condo. But right at the beginning of the film things take a dark turn as a German member of the European Parliament, and would-be customer, dies of a heart attack. She's got the presence of mind to call for medical help and then scoots out of the hotel. Soon the hunt is on for her, which doesn't stop her from continuing to work, something which eventually captures the eyes of a couple local pimps. Things go downhill from there.I liked this movie, but didn't love it. It wasn't anything terribly spectacular. The main character isn't that sympathetic or as interesting as the story wants you to think she is, though her father, a former rock musician trying to get back into the game was quite interesting. I'd actually rather like to see a movie just about him, since I think that could be really fascinating.I did get some vague feelings about the sense of quiet desperation with which she leads her life, but there were many times when I wanted to smack her upside the head and say, ""Hey, wake up and join reality!"" I was pleased at the outcome of the film, which seemed to me to be fairly realistic and well-suited to the story. I was also quite fascinated to see Slovenia, a country about which I know a little, but not much. Ljubljana itself looks like a very nice city and the small town she comes from seems quite lovely as well. I also really liked the fact that the film didn't seem to take any position one way or the other about the morality of prostitution. It just presents it as a fact of life and then deals with it. That was nice to see.Ultimately I can't really give a recommendation on this one. It was interesting enough, and not bad, but it's not one that I'm likely to watch again.== Short Subject ==This month's short subject is called Honor, and it centers around a woman (Mad Men's Elizabeth Moss), who recently lost her husband in Iraq. A former friend of his comes to visit her one day with a stack of letters and as the two people talk a dark secret is soon revealed.Again as with the main feature, I liked this short, but I didn't love it. Neither of the two characters really got or held my attention, and the central story didn't really interest me. The secret that's revealed and some of the emotional toll it's clearly taken on Moss' character was fairly interesting, but in a movie this brief there's not that much that could be done with it. It's not a bad short, but not anything worth taking a lot of effort to see.",3,Very much a simply ok movie.,1283817600,"09 7, 2010",2010,3364,"['special', 'thanks', 'Film', 'Movement', 'providing', 'screener', 'Prostitution', 'often', 'described', 'world', 'oldest', 'profession', 'various', 'points', 'history', 'been', 'banned', 'praised', 'made', 'form', 'worship', 'days', 'simply', 'what', 'least', 'people', 'viable', 'way', 'make', 'money.One', 'people', 'featured', 'latest', 'release', 'Film', 'Movement', 'film', 'drama', 'young', 'woman', 'Alexandra', 'Nina', 'Ivanisin', 'who', 'escaped', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'now', 'student', 'living', 'Ljubljana', 'capital', 'Slovenia', 'have', 'certain', 'kind', 'lifestyle', 'lifestyle', 'more', 'money', 'student', 'might', 'normally', 'have', 'many', 'attractive', 'people', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'start', 'selling', 'sex', 'get', 'life', 'wants.At', 'first', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'going', 'quite', 'well', 'soon', 'raking', 'enough', 'money', 'buy', 'small', 'condo', 'right', 'beginning', 'film', 'things', 'take', 'dark', 'turn', 'German', 'member', 'European', 'Parliament', 'would-be', 'customer', 'dies', 'heart', 'attack', 'got', 'presence', 'mind', 'call', 'medical', 'help', 'then', 'scoots', 'hotel', 'hunt', 'her', ""n't"", 'stop', 'continuing', 'work', 'something', 'eventually', 'eyes', 'couple', 'local', 'pimps', 'Things', 'go', 'downhill', 'there.I', 'liked', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'was', ""n't"", 'anything', 'terribly', 'spectacular', 'main', 'character', ""n't"", 'sympathetic', 'as', 'interesting', 'story', 'think', 'father', 'former', 'rock', 'musician', 'trying', 'get', 'back', 'game', 'was', 'quite', 'interesting', ""'d"", 'actually', 'rather', 'see', 'movie', 'just', 'think', 'could', 'be', 'really', 'fascinating.I', 'did', 'get', 'vague', 'feelings', 'sense', 'quiet', 'desperation', 'life', 'were', 'many', 'times', 'when', 'wanted', 'smack', 'upside', 'head', 'say', 'Hey', 'wake', 'up', 'join', 'reality', 'was', 'pleased', 'outcome', 'film', 'seemed', 'be', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'well-suited', 'story', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'fascinated', 'see', 'Slovenia', 'country', 'know', 'little', 'not', 'much', 'Ljubljana', 'very', 'nice', 'city', 'small', 'town', 'quite', 'lovely', 'as', 'well', 'also', 'really', 'liked', 'fact', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'take', 'position', 'one', 'way', 'other', 'morality', 'prostitution', 'just', 'fact', 'life', 'then', 'deals', 'was', 'nice', 'see.Ultimately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'give', 'recommendation', 'one', 'was', 'interesting', 'enough', 'not', 'bad', 'not', 'one', ""'m"", 'likely', 'watch', 'again.==', 'Short', 'Subject', '==This', 'month', 'short', 'subject', 'called', 'Honor', 'woman', 'Mad', 'Men', 'Elizabeth', 'Moss', 'who', 'recently', 'lost', 'husband', 'Iraq', 'former', 'friend', 'visit', 'one', 'day', 'stack', 'letters', 'two', 'people', 'talk', 'dark', 'secret', 'soon', 'revealed.Again', 'main', 'feature', 'liked', 'short', 'did', ""n't"", 'love', 'two', 'characters', 'really', 'got', 'held', 'attention', 'central', 'story', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'interest', 'secret', 'revealed', 'emotional', 'toll', 'clearly', 'taken', 'Moss', 'character', 'was', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'movie', 'brief', 'not', 'that', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'done', 'not', 'bad', 'short', 'not', 'anything', 'worth', 'taking', 'lot', 'effort', 'see']",N/A
1366784,A10HIGTSU45VAI,B003VA3JSG,CriticNic,"[0, 0]","A Call Girl, also known as Slovenian Girl, is a dark slice of life drama following a young student named Sasha (also known as Aleksandra) who doubles as a call girl to make extra money. One one hand she cherishes her relationship with her wannabe rockstar father, and on the other she is desperate to satisfy the craving of moving fast in the big city. Caught up between exams, clients, and debt Sasha is forced into rough situations that inevitably impact both of her lives.Nina Ivanisin is remarkable as the guarded yet determined Sasha. Her mysterious and depressive-like state is offset by her astounding beauty. She's scarily convincing as both the loving daughter and the working girl. Nina and the rest of the cast provide much realism that enhances the film and make it seem believable.Though there are several scenarios in the film, we don't have a single plot, nor a straight forward conclusion. Sasha faces large loan payments, pressures to do well in school, threats from street pimps, and personal relationship issues. Essentially, we're given a glimpse into the Solvenian Girl's struggles, and left uncertain but with a slight amount of hope.While the film is about a call girl, sex is only a small part of the picture. The film accurately portrays the differences between big city and small town life, in addition to the many challenges and decisions a young adult faces in taking on the real world. Additionally, finding that the film's director was inspired by real life Slovenian girls, young students using their bodies as means to get ahead, only made the film much more emotional for me.The beautifully shot scenes in the opposing Slovenian towns are well enhanced by an excellent soundtrack and the engaging performances. The film made me fall in love with its Slovenian girl, and very curious about more Slovenian films.Source: criticnic.com 26-December-2010",5,"Great coming-of-age drama, about more than just sex",1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1881,"['Call', 'Girl', 'also', 'known', 'Slovenian', 'Girl', 'dark', 'slice', 'life', 'drama', 'following', 'young', 'student', 'named', 'Sasha', 'also', 'known', 'Aleksandra', 'who', 'call', 'girl', 'make', 'extra', 'money', 'One', 'one', 'hand', 'relationship', 'wannabe', 'rockstar', 'father', 'other', 'desperate', 'satisfy', 'craving', 'moving', 'fast', 'big', 'city', 'Caught', 'up', 'exams', 'clients', 'debt', 'Sasha', 'forced', 'rough', 'situations', 'inevitably', 'impact', 'lives.Nina', 'Ivanisin', 'remarkable', 'guarded', 'yet', 'determined', 'Sasha', 'mysterious', 'depressive-like', 'state', 'offset', 'astounding', 'beauty', 'scarily', 'convincing', 'loving', 'daughter', 'working', 'girl', 'Nina', 'rest', 'cast', 'provide', 'much', 'realism', 'film', 'make', 'seem', 'are', 'several', 'scenarios', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'single', 'plot', 'straight', 'forward', 'conclusion', 'Sasha', 'large', 'loan', 'payments', 'pressures', 'do', 'well', 'school', 'threats', 'street', 'pimps', 'personal', 'relationship', 'issues', 'Essentially', ""'re"", 'given', 'glimpse', 'Solvenian', 'Girl', 'struggles', 'left', 'uncertain', 'slight', 'amount', 'hope.While', 'film', 'call', 'girl', 'sex', 'only', 'small', 'part', 'picture', 'film', 'accurately', 'differences', 'big', 'city', 'small', 'town', 'life', 'addition', 'many', 'challenges', 'decisions', 'young', 'adult', 'taking', 'real', 'world', 'Additionally', 'finding', 'film', 'director', 'was', 'inspired', 'real', 'life', 'Slovenian', 'girls', 'young', 'students', 'using', 'bodies', 'means', 'get', 'ahead', 'only', 'made', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'emotional', 'me.The', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'scenes', 'opposing', 'Slovenian', 'towns', 'are', 'well', 'enhanced', 'excellent', 'soundtrack', 'engaging', 'performances', 'film', 'made', 'fall', 'love', 'Slovenian', 'girl', 'very', 'curious', 'more', 'Slovenian', 'films.Source', 'criticnic.com', '26-December-2010']",N/A
1366785,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B003VA3JSG,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[3, 3]","A Call Girl is a rough adult drama that looks at alienation, what are reality and truth, and the effects of post communist Eastern Europe on a young woman.A Call Girl is a difficult movie. The opening montage is of a beautiful young woman discreetly going to a hotel room. It quickly becomes clear she is an independent escort. Because she is beautiful and seemingly innocent, I wanted her to succeed, to have good things happen to her. She ultimately steals money from the man. This is the central premise of the film; things aren't always as they appear. In a country where everybody was guaranteed a living no matter what job they did, capitalism completely changed the rules. Beautiful, well-meaning people now found themselves in a position where they had to do anything to make a living. It turns out that Sasha, the young woman, never tells the truth to anybody. She lies to get what she wants. The part of this movie that is so uncomfortable, she is convincing with those lies and I wanted her to get whatever she asked for.Some horrible things happen to Sasha. There are moments where I wish I hadn't seen that moment, and you can't undo that visual. Some of those horrible things are Sasha's own making, others are bad things just happened to her by no fault of her own. There is a bright side to the film; her father loves her more than anything in the world. Even to the extent that he talks with one of his friends about committing suicide, and says he couldn't ever do it because of his daughter.I couldn't stop watching this film. It is a brilliant view of a culture I could never know. The things that had to happen in that country to drive people to do what they have for money are impossible to imagine. Although Sasha was ashamed to tell her friends and father about what she did for money, that never stopped her from continuing, even when her life was threatened. This appears to be a metaphor for what is happening in Slovenia, people will do anything to survive or get ahead.This is a beautifully acted film. I loved the performances of the two central characters, Sasha and her father. The editing was interesting and forced me to watch carefully, sometimes a single cut would move time forward a few days, and others only an hour. The director did an excellent job making those jumps clear. The film is presented in various languages with subtitles. There are critical dramatic moments when Sasha speaks English or Slovene.The film is not rated. It is very much an adult film. There are several sex scenes, one fairly rough. These scenes are important dramatically and fit perfectly with the story line - there is nothing obscene about any of them. There is a lot of strong language. And of course the film deals with the subject of prostitution. There is a horrifying scene where somebody is almost thrown off a balcony. This is an adult film.I loved this film. It turned preconceived notions upside down for me. This was a complicated hour and a half film. One that I could not stop watching and enjoyed immensely. I have to admit, I didn't completely understand the film, and I just know I loved it.Film Movement includes an eighteen-minute short, Honored, on the DVD. This short fit perfectly with A Call Girl, it is an odd wrestling with alienation, and lies. I'm not sure I cared much for this film. It started off reasonably well. It then went into this really strange habit of people constantly leaving the room they were in. Of the eighteen minutes, I think ten were spent with people moving from one room to another and not being on camera anymore. It seemed quirky at first, and an odd thing to do.

This movie is not titillating as the title might lead you to suspect.  Rather it is an interesting study, as a film novel, of a girl who has made a series of bad choices without thinking of consequences and learns a life lesson.  The outcome is more fortunate than what could have possibly happened, and it was well acted out - I think the cast well chosen and the story well played.  My time was not wasted and as long as you're not looking for sexy scenes or a date flick, I suspect your time will not be wasted either.

Alexandra (Nina Ivanisin) is a twenty-three years old college student who lives with her father. She attends college in the capital of Slovenia. She is scarce on money. Alexandra wants to have a nice flat, but it is too expensive to keep. She falls further and further behind on payments. No matter how many clients she has, it is not enough to keep up with the payments. Her academics suffer as well. She becomes desperate to the point here she has to manipulate a professor to give her a passing grade for an exam. She lies to everyone: her clients, her professors, the bank teller, her friends, and her father. I feel for her poor father. He distracts himself from the dullness of his life by trying to start up his old band. His wife, Alexandra's mother, left him for a man she had an affair with. All the actors were all right. Her father's friends were quite stupid and goofy.  Alexandra looks quite homely though throughout the whole film. As if she needed a good night's sleep, or a shower. She was very defiant and sort of drained. Rather lifeless must say, but I will blame that on all the disgusting men she had to work with. She sure smokes up a chimney.  All in all, the film was a good simple portrayal of the classic call girl profession, aka prostitute.
