I agree with the featured reviewers in one sense only: you really should see this movie.I was astonished to see the vast number of glowing reviews on this page. I'm guessing most of them were written by America's postal carriers. There's a reason the critics savaged The Postman when it first came out. Its script is ridiculous and its drama beyond maudlin. The underlying theme - that a restoration of the postal service is the first step towards bringing freedom and justice back to a destroyed USA - is simply laughable. Kind of like the entire film!Costner is at his worst as the Postman, an aimless drifter who spins a web of lies to get a free meal and then runs from his post as soon as the downtrodden start to feel better about themselves. Olivia Williams plays his love interest, yet another woman seeking Costner's seed in a postapocalyptic future. Supporting cast includes Larenz Tate as the Postman's sidekick Ford Lincoln Mercury; Daniel von Bargen, a classic ""that guy"" who delivers the great line: ""RIDE, POSTMAN!""; and Tom Petty, who at first appears to be the mayor of a village on the Hoover Dam, until the Postman says ""Hey, aren't you famous"", and Petty replies, ""I was, once."" That's when you realize that TOM PETTY IS PLAYING HIMSELF. It's the kind of jaw-droppingly awful moment that typifies this film.The very entertaining villain, General Bethlehem, is played by Will Patton, who apparently was living on a diet of scenery during the shoot. Try keeping a straight face when he bellows lines like ""I was AT the Battle of Georgetown, I saw the White House BURN to the GROUND!!!""But it's really the small moments that make this film a horrid spectacle worth laughing at again and again. When the Postman inspires a small village with his...postal carrying, a small girl begins to sing ""God Bless America"". Say what?! Another horrid scene involves a young boy hoping against hope that the Postman will pick up his letter - this later becomes the astoundingly dumb denouement of the film. Just imagine a three-hour-long movie packed with idiocies such as these, and you've got the Postman.

105216,AK6UVFSU07NXH,0790736489,Anthony Hinde,"[161, 183]","It is difficult to review a film that you like, when every professional critic has slammed it. On the other hand, I have to believe I am not alone in my tastes, so, here is some praise for &quot;The Postman&quot;, Kevin  Costner's cinematic version of the great book of the same name, written by  David Brin.After the success of &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot;,  it's pretty clear that Costner has been trying to recapture that epic  feeling. But where &quot;Water World&quot; was silly to the point of being  a caricature of a sweeping drama, &quot;The Postman&quot; avoids the trap.  The nemesis, General Bethlehem is played seriously by Will Patton and the  situation in general is believable if not completely explained.I  admit there were a few moments that were too heavy handed, the most  memorable when the Postman gallops back to snatch a letter from a boy's  hand. Even so, I can forgive a little over enthusiasm when it is mixed with  a stirring tale. I know that during times of war, rhetoric is grist for the  mill and so, the character's obsession with the American way, is  understandable, given that it no longer exists.You see,  civilisation has fallen. It's implied that nuclear weapons were used,  perhaps even biological weapons. Whatever the cause, people survive  precariously, huddled together in fortified towns dreading the next visit  of the Holenist army. A band of thugs created during the last days of the  war and now led by General Bethlehem towards some nebulous vision, who's  only constant is that Bethlehem will be the one in power.Enter  stage left, an unlikely hero. Kevin Costner's character may have a name but  it is not revealed during the film. At first he is known as Shakespeare  because he is a wandering loner who is sometimes driven to produce one man,  one mule, productions of the Bard in the hopes of winning a meal from his  audience. His aimless existence is abruptly ended when he is roughly  drafted into the Holenist army.From the first he stands out from  the crowd of beaten hopeless recruits and so is singled out for special  torments and duties. The army life is brutal enough without having earned  the enmity of your squad leader. One thing leads to another and escape  presents itself for Shakespeare. Without food or any other protection he  stumbles on the remains of an old mail van and spends a night huddled in  its dubious warmth, kept company by the body of a US Postal worker.Whether by chance, destiny or foresight, he dons the guise of a postman  and scams his way into a local town. &quot;The mailman's here. Lock up your  dogs.&quot; So long starved of civilisation, the bedraggled townsmen  clamour for news of the world, the government, the future. He has little  choice but to answer their questions, with creative and plausible fictions.  It is here that the wheels of fate start turning.The idea he has  created, of a new America, is too big for one man to control. The film  takes us on a steamroller ride headed straight towards the Holenist army.  People with hope demand action. The desire for action creates leaders.  Leaders are often forced to carry out the will of the people despite a lack  of talent, desire or knowledge.In this case, a young man, self  named Ford Lincoln Mercury, forces the Postman to become a symbol of  civilisation and eventually the symbol of resistance. Ford's passion and  his actions are resisted for a long time but eventually the Postman comes  to share the myth. One man can stand up to tyranny, especially with the  help of a few courageous friends and the trust of one strong willed woman.",4,POST-&quot;apocolyptic&quot;-MAN,958953600,"05 22, 2000",2000,3609,"['difficult', 'review', 'film', 'like', 'when', 'professional', 'critic', 'slammed', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'believe', 'am', 'not', 'alone', 'tastes', 'so', 'here', 'praise', 'quot', 'Postman', 'quot', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'cinematic', 'version', 'great', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'written', 'David', 'Brin.After', 'success', 'quot', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'quot', 'pretty', 'clear', 'Costner', 'been', 'trying', 'recapture', 'epic', 'feeling', 'where', 'quot', 'Water', 'World', 'quot', 'was', 'silly', 'point', 'being', 'caricature', 'sweeping', 'drama', 'quot', 'Postman', 'quot', 'trap', 'nemesis', 'General', 'Bethlehem', 'played', 'seriously', 'Will', 'Patton', 'situation', 'general', 'believable', 'not', 'completely', 'explained.I', 'admit', 'were', 'few', 'moments', 'were', 'too', 'heavy', 'handed', 'most', 'memorable', 'when', 'Postman', 'back', 'snatch', 'letter', 'boy', 'hand', 'Even', 'so', 'can', 'forgive', 'little', 'over', 'enthusiasm', 'when', 'mixed', 'stirring', 'tale', 'know', 'times', 'war', 'rhetoric', 'grist', 'mill', 'so', 'character', 'obsession', 'American', 'way', 'understandable', 'given', 'no', 'longer', 'exists.You', 'see', 'civilisation', 'fallen', 'implied', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'were', 'used', 'perhaps', 'even', 'biological', 'weapons', 'cause', 'people', 'survive', 'precariously', 'huddled', 'together', 'fortified', 'towns', 'dreading', 'next', 'visit', 'Holenist', 'army', 'band', 'thugs', 'created', 'last', 'days', 'war', 'now', 'led', 'General', 'Bethlehem', 'nebulous', 'vision', 'who', 'only', 'constant', 'Bethlehem', 'will', 'be', 'one', 'power.Enter', 'stage', 'left', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'character', 'may', 'have', 'name', 'not', 'revealed', 'film', 'first', 'known', 'Shakespeare', 'wandering', 'loner', 'who', 'sometimes', 'driven', 'produce', 'one', 'man', 'one', 'mule', 'productions', 'Bard', 'hopes', 'winning', 'meal', 'audience', 'aimless', 'existence', 'abruptly', 'ended', 'when', 'roughly', 'drafted', 'Holenist', 'first', 'out', 'crowd', 'beaten', 'hopeless', 'recruits', 'so', 'singled', 'out', 'special', 'torments', 'duties', 'army', 'life', 'brutal', 'enough', 'having', 'earned', 'enmity', 'squad', 'leader', 'One', 'thing', 'escape', 'presents', 'Shakespeare', 'food', 'other', 'protection', 'remains', 'old', 'mail', 'van', 'night', 'huddled', 'dubious', 'warmth', 'kept', 'company', 'body', 'US', 'Postal', 'worker.Whether', 'chance', 'destiny', 'foresight', 'guise', 'postman', 'scams', 'way', 'local', 'town', 'quot', 'mailman', 'here', 'Lock', 'up', 'dogs.', 'quot', 'long', 'starved', 'civilisation', 'bedraggled', 'townsmen', 'clamour', 'news', 'world', 'government', 'future', 'little', 'choice', 'answer', 'questions', 'creative', 'plausible', 'fictions', 'here', 'wheels', 'fate', 'start', 'turning.The', 'idea', 'created', 'new', 'America', 'too', 'big', 'one', 'man', 'control', 'film', 'steamroller', 'ride', 'headed', 'straight', 'Holenist', 'army', 'People', 'hope', 'demand', 'action', 'desire', 'action', 'leaders', 'Leaders', 'are', 'often', 'forced', 'carry', 'out', 'will', 'people', 'lack', 'talent', 'desire', 'knowledge.In', 'case', 'young', 'man', 'self', 'named', 'Ford', 'Lincoln', 'Mercury', 'Postman', 'become', 'symbol', 'civilisation', 'eventually', 'symbol', 'resistance', 'Ford', 'passion', 'actions', 'are', 'resisted', 'long', 'time', 'eventually', 'Postman', 'share', 'myth', 'One', 'man', 'can', 'stand', 'up', 'tyranny', 'especially', 'help', 'few', 'courageous', 'friends', 'trust', 'one', 'strong', 'willed', 'woman']",N/A

It was one of those movies that everyone should see about how important it is to have hope and faith in something.  The year is 2013, and  it is after a third world war.  Kevin Costner plays a man who with his  donkey walks through the desert of Utah's great salt platte.  There are no  trees to speak of, and no water to be found.  He stumbles upon a town where  he entertains the townfolk with Shakespeare.  Then the bad people come: an  army of really bad guys led by Will Patton who plays Bethlehem.  Bethlehem  is a person who would rather kill than look at another human being.  He  doesn't care if it is a man, woman or child that is killed.  He captures  the man he calls Shakespeare, and brands him with a mark so he will be  recognized as one of his men.  But Shakespeare escapes, and while he's  hiding out, he finds a skeleton and a United States Postal bag full of  undelivered mail.  Hence, he becomes The Postman, delivering mail to bring  hope to all.  Even after he deputizes another young man to also be a  postman, and that young man deputizes several other young people to be mail  carriers, and even though several of those young people get killed  delivering mail, the fight for hope and justice wins out at the end of the  movie.This is a great movie and I've just added it to my wish list.

There has been a nuclear war and the U.S. does not exist anymore. There is no more trchnology and the  remaining survivors live in small communities. Eventually Costner becomes a  postman and tries to restore order to the bleak future. There is more to  the plot, but i dont want to explain. The one thing that dissapoited me was  the fact that we didnt see any of this apoclyptic war. I wanted to see the  war that broke down society. We dont know too much about this war either.  We figure its a nuclear war. We know about the plague that struck and a 3  year winter. I would have liked to see this though. I like this movie for  one reason because its a future lesson on what could happed to society.  More movies should be made about this. A pretty good movie.

It is a remarkable story of how one man gave people hope, freedom, and the chance for a better life in what was a very dismill and nearly decimated country.  The only reason I give this movie 4 instead of 5 stars is that the movie fails to deliver on one very important matter and that is in the movie it fails to explain exactly what happened to the U.S. and the rest of the world for that matter to put it in the state that it is and also fails to give a proper backround about the holnist clan.  come on kevin you should know better than that.  Its basic movie 101 never forget to explain the history.  I was suprised to see one particualr scene cut short which is at the end when the leader of the holnist clan is defeated only his second in command lays down his gun where the vhs version shows everyone doing it.

Costner plays a man in a broken down USA who finds a postman's bag of mail, and eventually sets up a mail system among the now isolated towns in the American north-west. When a gang of brigands that preys on the towns causes him grief, he moves beyond his ""every man"" status to organize resistance.It is a solid story. It progresses logically. It has the right mix of bad guys to provide tension, and it has a realistic hero who develops some ideals, rather than a superman who mows thru every villain in sight, then flexes and asks for more.I enjoyed the movie, and most people will unless they got up on the wrong side of the TV that day.

Well I finally took the plunge and just finished the almost three hour marathon and you know what, I liked it. Yes the film is too long and it loses some artistic value with its numerous overt attempts to pull on your emotional heartstrings, but it's also a wonderfully positive and uplifting tale of how through the efforts (intentional or not) of one man an urban legend springs forth giving hope and inspiration to a struggling, chaotic, post-apocalyptic world.Kevin Costner is quite good in the title role of the Postman/Shakespeare and Will Paxton delivers one of his usual strong performances as the adversarial General Bethlehem.

And the less I say about the two actors throwing Shakespeare at each other -- one after a lithium dose, the other after a three-day coke binge -- the better.It's also clear Costner still hasn't solved the pacing problem that's dogged him since 'Dances with Wolves': the early scenes go on way too long and individual pieces cry out for editing.  But if you can accept the pace, this is a decent film with a very interesting concept of postal carriers uniting a group of mutually suspicious post-apocalyptic survivalist communities.  Yeah, when I first saw the trailer for this movie in 1997, I laughed, and the critical reaction to the film was partially justified.  But the action scenes are done very well, and the actors make it hold together (particularly Larenz Tate as Costner's second-in-command).  And despite its sillier moments, the script never ventures completely into the unbelievable.You could do worse: Costner's movies, at least, attempt to create a mythology for their heroes to inhabit, and he has a knack for transporting the viewer into a convincing version of another time.

Couldn't forgive Costner for wasting my time with such a long and ridiculous movie. Spent years making fun of it, warning people away from it. Rooting for Costner to fail again. He had actually hurt my feelings. How could the man behind &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; have unleashed such a dopey, awful, pretentious film? How could he do it to himself?OK. I'm now older and I think a little wiser about film. I saw Costner sink to the depths of his career with that terrible Elvis impersonator flick and also &quot;For Love of the Game.&quot; One night I saw &quot;The Postman&quot; in the cheap DVD bin and, for no reason at all, snatched it up. Couldn't wait to see it again. Watched it all the way through. Still didn't like it ... but my loathing had gone away.This is a bad movie, no question. I had not been incorrect in my initial response. There are major things wrong with it, from the script to Costner's direction to his performance to the editing to the photography to the story to the .... you get the idea. It has about an hour's worth of plot stretched out over an interminable three hours. It is syrupy, corny, unintentionally hilarious. Worse, it is self-indulgent to the point of idiocy. Somebody should have whacked Kev upside the head before it got out of control.All of that said ... it is something of a noble failure. Costner was trying to get at something here that was no less ambitious than &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; or his own &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot; Maybe he wanted to do a &quot;Braveheart&quot; updated for modern times, with his postman representing a futuristic, Westernized William Wallace. There is a faint thread of the classic heroic theme here. And there's no question that Costner intended to make a Western; there sure are a lot of horses.I am no longer angry with Costner for making &quot;The Postman,&quot; and today I look on the movie as an anomaly, since &quot;Open Range&quot; has more than redeemed the star's directing career. In fact, I think Costner should direct more films. Maybe he had to get &quot;The Postman&quot; out of his system and start from scratch.What's strange is that the movie now has an appeal for me that I can't explain. I guess it has become a guilty pleasure, a conversation piece, an enigma on DVD. In fact, I might rather watch &quot;The Postman&quot; than &quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; another syrupy and bizzare Costner flick.Movies are forever. Maybe 10 years from now, we'll have a completely different perception of &quot;The Postman,&quot; and perhaps then, Costner will be vindicated.

I happened to really like it because it is a movie of hope, rather than despair.  The main plot is the re-establishment of mail service after it has stopped, due to a disaster that has left the country split into small communities with no communication between them.  With so much other media available these days, especially the internet, our mail hasn't become as important to us as it once was.  Getting a letter used to be a huge thrill; now all the mailman brings are advertisements and bills.  Everyone uses e-mail now; even grandmothers!  Still, I suspect that if we lost our mail delivery, we would feel the pinch.  A healthy mail delivery system is truly the lifeblood of a strong country.  Does that sound corny?  This movie does get a bit corny, syrupy, sappy and silly at times.  I happen to like this sentimental corny stuff and if you do too, you'll love the movie.  This movie rates high in my book just for the message it delivers.  Okay, so maybe it doesn't ""deliver"" it the best way possible.  This is escapism and fantasy.  If you analyse it too closely you will find a lot of flaws.  Just sit back and relax and watch and enjoy the movie.  Whenever a movie is so roundly criticized, it is worth a look just to see if you agree or not.  Unfortunately, sometimes you will say to yourself ""This was as bad as they said"".  Other times you may be pleasantly surprised.  This one may surprise you and it may not.  Maybe with a few minor changes this could have been a much better movie, but I loved it anyway.  Maybe it helped that I didn't recognize Tom Petty. By the way, I liked Waterworld too, but it wasn't nearly as good as this movie.

Just a couple of thoughts to underscore my overall positive rating.I'll agree that the film might have been too long but if you were to ask me what I would cut the only answer I can give revolves around Bill the mule escaping his fate at the hands of an army cook. Would this shorten the film? Er, no. So I don't know, hell, shorter sex scene? Well, there's three minutes. I guess if a talented editor really sharpened his scissors you could trim fifteen minutes. I just couldn't make it any shorter than that without destroying it.I read a few of the one star reviews and they either mentioned the film butchered the book (like that's never happened) or it was too long. One reviewer went on to say that it could easily have been a success at two hours. Really?Otherwise, I liked the movie and feel it is original, well written, patriotic, well acted and executed with sincerity and not in the tongue-in-cheek manner of ""Waterworld"". (I was not a fan of WW and consider it a horrible film though I loved his boat and the color of the water.)I do think this film suffered at the hands of critics for the fact that it does share common elements of WW (Post Apocalypse/Loner/Evil Band) and ""Dances With Wolves"" (Wilderness/Loner/Evil Band). Of course Costner is going to be held up to very sharp light after ""Dances"".Another observation, where are you going to find a movie made with that kind of scenery? In those locations? The locations where this story was set became a character in itself. No ruined cities, suburbs or ghost towns here.

It seems to me that these sentiments are now in fashion once again, and this movie deserves another look.  What could be more appropriate for these times than a movie that frames mail delivery as an heroic aspect of civilization?Yes, the movie has a few problems:  Some of the lines are cheesy, the &quot;un-ironic&quot; aspect veers close to corniness at a few points, and the film is sometimes unnecessarily violent given it's flag-waving message (I suspect that the violence was calulated to produce an R-rating in an ill-conceived marketing effort).  But overall, this is a visually beautiful, stirring film with several interesting premises, and is really quite intelligent in an &quot;unsophisticated&quot; way.Here's an observation:  One minor plot detail in THE POSTMAN goes a long way to explaining this movie.  At the beginning, conscripts in the evil army are allowed to watch THE SOUND OF MUSIC, but the leaders are displeased when UNIVERSAL SOLDIER is loaded on the projector.  In a sense, THE POSTMAN has THE SOUND OF MUSIC's lack of irony, and thus was pilloried when it was released in the cynical late 90's.  Conversely, THE POSTMAN's weakest moments are when it tries to inject UNIVERSAL SOLDIER-like elements.  Sounds like the rock-throwing evil-army leaders had it just about right.  Too bad the studio marketing department didn't listen!Give this movie another chance.  In the public's current state of mind, THE POSTMAN could be a big hit.

I've never seen one movie so pummelled as this one, and it darn sure didn't, and doesn't, deserve it.  I was shocked when the reviews poured in, and most were mean-spirited.  They couldn't possibly be reviewing the movie I saw, could they?Hey, I  admit it, I'm a Kevin Costner fan.  I've liked almost everything he's been  associated with.  While ""The Postman"" is not a great movie (although it  could have been), it is a good movie.  The audience in the theater  applauded loudly when the credits rolled up...and no, not because it  mercifully ended;-).  Note:  I saw the movie before most of the negative  reviews poured in (probably the first time in history that critics agreed  with each other).""The Postman"", loosely based on David Brin's novel, is  about a post-apocalyptic world struggling to survive.  The scattered  remnants of humanity have banded together in small towns and hamlets, and  are isolated from each other and the rest of the world because a powerful  rogue band of survivalists (known as Holnists) patrol and control the  countryside.  A lone scavenger (Costner), who by chance comes across a  wrecked postal truck filled with 16 year-old mail, figures he can `glean'  food and favors from these villages by telling them that he is an official  postman and that the United States government is being restored.  For the  first time in 16 years, people have been given hope, and what starts out as  a simple con, soon grows out of proportion and is beyond his (or anyone's)  ability to control.Although the movie is three hours long and has  several embarrassing ""Costner"" moments (including a somewhat corny and  anti-climactic ending), it was never boring.  Although this movie won't be  to everyones' liking, I found it very entertaining and David Brin's premise  original, if not down-right brilliant.  Even with the problems stated  above, I give ""The Postman"" 7 out of 10, and a word of caution:  Don't  believe everything you read from movie critics (good or bad).Note:  David Brin's novel:  Although I am probably in the minority here, I have to  say that I was disappointed in Brin's novel, or at least in the development  of his characters.  Brin never made me care for anyone other than Gordon  (the postman).  Even Gordon's love interest (Dena), wasn't developed to the  point where I cared one way or another about her.

It's easy to understand how we got from here to there (there being the future).

Almost no other film of this genre has been able to have  such a breathtaking look.However, aside from an interesting premise,  some great cinematography, decent performances, and a sensuous love scene  between Olivia Williams and Kevin Costner, I have to say the film has  almost nothing else going for it.If you were to watch the film once you  would notice how dull it was.  Now, to be fair the film is easy to watch  for the first hour and a half.  The plot does initially pull us in with the  help of the gorgeous cinematography.  But, of course, after a relatively  well paced first half, the film goes into dull mode for as the rest of the  movie plods through its heavy-handed message and boring &quot;fights&quot;  for freedom.If you were to watch the film a second time or to think back  over your viewing you would notice how uintentionally campy and corny it  is.  The terrible dialogue becomes more noticeable particularly one scene  where Olivia Williams (who delivers the best performance in this film)  tells Costner he delivers &quot;hope like candy to a baby.&quot;  How does  the rest of the acting fare?  Costner is his typical bland self, Larenz  Tate's character is extremely annoying, Will Patton overacts (as usual),  and Daniel Von Bargen's last line of dialogue is an uintentional howler.Do I have anything else to say about this movie?  Other than the fact  that if you aren't into post-apocalyptic films you should stay away.

105264,A84UFSF2SZS2W,0790736489,"EriKa ""E""","[6, 13]","Sometimes actors and indeed all types of artists seem to have a need to create pieces simply to flatter their own sense of self-importance or vanity. The Postman seems like such a vehicle for Kevin Costner. Maybe not to quite the magnitude that John Travolta's Battlefield Earth is, but it is still an overly long, dull, and completely (and needlessly pretentious) film. I read the reviews and often the ""official"" reviews don't at all reflect what an average movieviewer would think, so I reserved my opinion until I saw the film for myself, which I eventually did. I am not the biggest fan of Kevin Costner to start with, so this skewed my opinion, but I am definitely a fan of receiving postal mail, so I thought... well, maybe at least having mail delivered is a good reason to watch the film. From the beginning til the end, the dialogue is totally inane, the characters are one-dimensional, and Costner's inability to act is at the worst junction of his career. I think the story could have been simpler, and the ending... oh, heavens to betsy, the ending! At some point in the film, Costner is enslaved by some sort of tribe that lives by a set of rules. This tribe rides through the land demanding tribute from the villagers. I do not remember the name of this group, but it seems its members were tattooed with certain numbers (maybe it was 8) and any member of the group 8 could at any time challenge the leader of 8 for dominance of the group. Whatever the case, when Costner's character becomes a slave in this tribe of 8 (or whatever it is) he manages to escape, which is when he finds a wrecked postal truck, the skeleton of a dead postman and a bunch of undelivered mail. He dresses in the postal uniform and attempts to deliver mail to a nearby walled-in village, which is greeted by both skepticism and hope. Fair enough. The scene at the end, however, which culminates with the most idiotic fight scene I have ever seen on film, is between Costner, (who is, naturally, the Postman) and the leader of this tribe of 8 (Bethlehem, played by Will Patton who seems relatively unknown although he appears everywhere, including in No Way Out with Kevin Costner.  Costner, who is tattooed with the symbol of 8, challenges this leader to a fight in order to gain leadership himself. You can imagine how hokey and completely unbelievable this is. You can also imagine that Costner wins and creates a new, just, and democratic society... whatever.",1,THE FIGHT SCENE AT THE END?

I have always been hesitant about watching this movie because of all the bad reviews the film recieved when it was released. However, what I have usually found is that many times critics and I disagree on what makes a good movie. I think this is why it is often advisable to not look too much at reviews before seeing a movie. I found this movie, for the most part, very enjoyable.Kevin Costner plays a drifter who leads a group of people against a general by calling together the refugees of his revitalized post office system (sure, it's a little far-fetched, but it is set in a postapocolyptic society which, perhaps, gives it some credibility). As he comes to a town, he becomes to be known a legend known as &quot;the Postman&quot;, responsible for not only delivering mail to the local villages, but also hope. Eventually, with the help of a young man, he forms a group that take part in his cause.One of the major problems of this movie is time length. Certainly this movie could have been cut down to 2 hours or less. Instead, it goes on a bit too long (about 2 hrs. 50 mins), and loses some of its vigor while we wait for a climatic finish.It is the kind of movie that is not as bad as people make it out to be. Sure, it does take a very odd plot idea and run with it. The idea of a futuristic post office system going against tyrants who are unpatriotic is certainly unique in its own right.  And, it is no &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot; However, the  movie's message of having a sense of patriotism and following a goal to the end makes it worthy of some credit. If you do watch, make sure you have some time on your hands.Overall I think it is a so-so effort.

Both have the charisma to get people to follow them, almost without trying, and in the Postman's case, he doesn't even want followers.But the people who have been struggling at subsistence level for 16 years all badly want better lives, for themselves and their children, who have grown up with no dreams, no ideals, with nothing to aspire to. And the Postman comes to care for them, for these people who believe in what he represents so strongly they're willing to die for him. They're all simple, scared people who love their families, but because they love, they find the courage to take the kinds of stands that can get themselves killed. And some do.But each death is a message for those watching, and those deaths spur more action, in the right direction to join all the disparate towns together into a nation once more. And all started by a cowardly drifter with a talent for telling tall tales, who learns to love, comes to believe in his own dreams, and finally takes action.P.S.

From WaterWorld to Wyatt Earp, Costner tends to favor the stoic role where lines are simply recited. We've seen more inflection in grade-school plays.But I like the guy. And I liked WaterWorld. And I really liked Wyatt Earp. And I loved The Postman. Loved it.The story is about a second Civil War in the United States, and this time you get the feeling that The Confederates won. There is no official government in place, just a guy named Bethlehem who runs the show. Bethlehem periodically shows up to small surviving towns with his expanding army, to take whatever resources he wants from these towns; including ""pure bloods"" for his army.Parallel to this is a Nameless Nomad (Kevin Costner) who has stolen a uniform from the skeletal corpse of a Postal Worker and uses it as a way to con food from the same small towns visited by Bethlehem. Problem is, you can't have a United States Postal Worker without a United States Government - so the Nomad goes along with the lie that the United States has been re-united. When word of this Restored United States reaches Bethlehem, they set out to destroy this restored government - and the Nameless Nomad.Come on...no matter how much you might not like Costner you have to admit, that's one original storyline. Even the characters defy cliche: General Bethlehem used to be a copy machine salesman before the war. The Nameless Nomad used to be a Shakespearean actor. One character goes by the name of Ford Lincoln Mercury - after the line of cars. If you find yourself mocking the mixed bag of characters, good. That's kind of what the movie wants you do. It seeks to undeify our Napoleo-moronic heroes of war. As Costner says to Bethlehem: ""Wouldn't it be great if wars could be settled by the a**holes who start them?""It also seeks to make mavericks of the mundane people of our world - like postal carriers.Believe it or not you will actually see heroic clips of the infamously stoic Mr. Costner delivering the mail.",5,Restoring the United States -- and Kevin Costner,1245888000,"06 25, 2009",2009,2242,"['Man', 'always', ""'m"", 'making', 'smoking-gun', 'confession', 'when', 'admit', 'liking', 'movie', 'others', 'hated', 'worse', 'liking', 'actor', 'others', 'hate', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'instance', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'nothing', 'bad', 'things', 'ol', 'boy', 'Most', 'criticism', 'being', 'dry', 'actor', 'WaterWorld', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'Costner', 'favor', 'stoic', 'role', 'where', 'lines', 'are', 'simply', 'recited', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'more', 'inflection', 'grade-school', 'plays.But', 'guy', 'liked', 'WaterWorld', 'really', 'liked', 'Wyatt', 'Earp', 'loved', 'Postman', 'Loved', 'it.The', 'story', 'second', 'Civil', 'War', 'United', 'States', 'time', 'get', 'feeling', 'Confederates', 'won', 'official', 'government', 'place', 'just', 'guy', 'named', 'Bethlehem', 'who', 'show', 'Bethlehem', 'periodically', 'up', 'small', 'surviving', 'towns', 'expanding', 'army', 'take', 'resources', 'towns', 'including', 'pure', 'bloods', 'army.Parallel', 'Nameless', 'Nomad', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'who', 'stolen', 'uniform', 'skeletal', 'corpse', 'Postal', 'Worker', 'way', 'con', 'food', 'same', 'small', 'towns', 'visited', 'Bethlehem', 'Problem', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'United', 'States', 'Postal', 'Worker', 'United', 'States', 'Government', 'so', 'Nomad', 'along', 'lie', 'United', 'States', 'been', 're-united', 'When', 'word', 'Restored', 'United', 'States', 'Bethlehem', 'set', 'out', 'destroy', 'restored', 'government', 'Nameless', 'Nomad.Come', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'Costner', 'have', 'admit', 'one', 'original', 'storyline', 'Even', 'characters', 'defy', 'cliche', 'General', 'Bethlehem', 'used', 'be', 'copy', 'machine', 'salesman', 'war', 'Nameless', 'Nomad', 'used', 'be', 'Shakespearean', 'actor', 'One', 'character', 'name', 'Ford', 'Lincoln', 'Mercury', 'line', 'cars', 'find', 'mocking', 'mixed', 'bag', 'characters', 'good', 'kind', 'what', 'movie', 'do', 'undeify', 'Napoleo-moronic', 'heroes', 'war', 'Costner', 'Bethlehem', 'Would', ""n't"", 'be', 'great', 'wars', 'could', 'be', 'settled', 'a**holes', 'who', 'start', 'also', 'make', 'mavericks', 'mundane', 'people', 'world', 'postal', 'carriers.Believe', 'not', 'will', 'actually', 'see', 'heroic', 'clips', 'infamously', 'Mr.', 'Costner', 'delivering', 'mail']",N/A

He didn't love it, but he said it's better than its reputation of being one of the worst films ever made.It is a good film.The Postman was maligned like hell when it was released, mostly for its length (just under 3 hours), and general hokiness.  Some called it an ego trip for Costner (who stars in it, co-produced it, and directed it).  Honestly, it's what one would call a ""noble failure"".  I haven't read the book it is based on (which is supposed to be great), but I liked a lot in the film.  The first 30 minutes are the best with Costner's character (he's never actually named in the movie) roaming the wasteland as a performer with his donkey, going to settlements along the way performing for food.  He gets captured by General Bethlehem's army (the general is played by Will Patton in the film's most outlandish, over the top performance), and is forced to serve.  He escapes, and finds an abandoned postal truck.  He puts on the postman's clothes and says he's been given a directive by the new US government to deliver the mail again.  He's lying, but people believe him, and he ends up starting something that he never dreamed of.The good stuff is the film has great cinematography and a fascinating premise.  Unfortunately, the acting is over the top and too melodramatic, the music score is WAY over the top (it ends up being unintentionally funny), and there are some really cutesy passages of dialogue that make one grimace (and they feel like Costner improvised them).  But there are still powerful, surprising moments in the film, and the film isn't boring, despite a 3 hour running time.  The length isn't the problem; in fact, if it was longer, it might have been even better.  It feels like Costner tried to get too much in, and the film ends up being rushed, hokey, and corny, especially at the end.

His own moral code is not perfect - he's willing to lie and cheat in order to survive - but those values which ARE important to him, he will not compromise.He finds, during the course of this movie, that one can accomplish a great deal when one works with a group of like-minded people. He learns that people CAN be trusted. He learns to fight back and he learns that he is willing to risk his own life for higher principles.It's not an overtly moralistic story, but it is very much a story of doing what's right and standing up for what one believes.The Postman is truly a hero.Abby was likewise a very believable heroine.

Mical,"[29, 38]","As a huge fan of David Brin, whose book &quot;The Postman&quot; served as the basis for this film, and the post-apocalyptic genre in general, I was looking forward to seeing this movie.  My friends tried to warn me away from it, and after all the negative press I read, it was hard to keep an open mind.The Postman isn't awful, but it is incredibly overlong.  It seems to crawl about as fast as a bulldozer out of gas.  Thankfully, the plot develops in that time, but The Postman lacks the sweeping, involving, intricate details that define an &quot;epic&quot; (and David Brin's books).The problem is that Costner and the editors wanted to include as much material from the novel as possible, but instead of folding plots into each other, it only half-develops different lines, or totally leaves them untouched.  The Holnists, for example, while only playing a major role in the last quarter of the book, become a variety of &quot;devolved&quot; enemies and serve as the &quot;main bad guys&quot; in the film.David Brin's works are extremely complex and intelligent, which Costner and company no doubt recognized, but The Postman was partially dumbed-down for audiences more interested in brainless action-schlock like Mission Impossible 2 or the watered-down &quot;epic&quot; Gladiator.  The dumbing-down occured in the wrong places; the editors no doubt assumed that audiences would have the attention span to sit through a three-hour movie but still wanted something substance-less - it just doesn't work.  By trying to satisfy the fans who wanted the complexity and sincerity of the book, and attempting to appeal to the wider popcorn-munching audience, Costner strove for a middle ground, the same route he found with dazzling success in Dances With Wolves, and ended up falling off the fence.The Postman is worth watching for the post-apocalyptic sets and ideas, especially if you are interested in the genre, but I can't imagine this film as much more than an artifact, appealing to the few of us who enjoy the post-nuclear, post-apocalyptic films like The Postman.DVD dirt -The transfer is OK - not great, but not terrible.  You can tell it was done in the early days of dual layer, because there is a slight hiccup at every chapter change.  Some sections of the film seem quite dirty, with obvious splotches and scratches.  The sound transfer isn't bad, but the voices and the effects aren't mixed properly; viewers with a center-channel system can simply turn that speaker up, but those without will experience very quiet dialogue with very loud music and ear-blistering explosions that seem almost out of place.The only extra worth talking about is the &quot;Postman's CGI Route&quot; featurette, which talks mostly about splicing green-screened actors onto computer-touched-up shots of landscapes, or replacing some background scenery with matte images or still frames.  Nothing terribly special, and the featurette only lasts for 15 minutes or so.",3,"Call in the editors, quick!",978134400,"12 30, 2000",2000,2960,"['huge', 'fan', 'David', 'Brin', 'book', 'quot', 'Postman', 'quot', 'served', 'basis', 'film', 'post-apocalyptic', 'genre', 'general', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'movie', 'friends', 'tried', 'warn', 'away', 'negative', 'press', 'read', 'was', 'hard', 'keep', 'open', 'mind.The', 'Postman', ""n't"", 'awful', 'incredibly', 'overlong', 'crawl', 'as', 'fast', 'bulldozer', 'gas', 'Thankfully', 'plot', 'time', 'Postman', 'sweeping', 'involving', 'intricate', 'details', 'define', 'quot', 'quot', 'David', 'Brin', 'books', '.The', 'problem', 'Costner', 'editors', 'wanted', 'include', 'much', 'material', 'novel', 'possible', 'instead', 'folding', 'plots', 'other', 'only', 'different', 'lines', 'totally', 'untouched', 'Holnists', 'example', 'only', 'playing', 'major', 'role', 'last', 'quarter', 'book', 'become', 'variety', 'quot', 'devolved', 'quot', 'enemies', 'serve', 'quot', 'main', 'bad', 'guys', 'quot', 'film.David', 'Brin', 'works', 'are', 'extremely', 'complex', 'intelligent', 'Costner', 'company', 'no', 'doubt', 'recognized', 'Postman', 'was', 'partially', 'dumbed-down', 'audiences', 'more', 'interested', 'brainless', 'action-schlock', 'Mission', 'Impossible', '2', 'watered-down', 'quot', 'quot', 'Gladiator', 'dumbing-down', 'occured', 'wrong', 'places', 'editors', 'doubt', 'assumed', 'audiences', 'would', 'have', 'attention', 'span', 'sit', 'three-hour', 'movie', 'still', 'wanted', 'something', 'substance-less', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'trying', 'satisfy', 'fans', 'who', 'wanted', 'complexity', 'sincerity', 'book', 'attempting', 'appeal', 'wider', 'popcorn-munching', 'audience', 'Costner', 'strove', 'middle', 'ground', 'same', 'route', 'found', 'dazzling', 'success', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'ended', 'up', 'falling', 'off', 'fence.The', 'Postman', 'worth', 'watching', 'post-apocalyptic', 'sets', 'ideas', 'especially', 'are', 'interested', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'imagine', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'artifact', 'appealing', 'few', 'who', 'enjoy', 'post-nuclear', 'post-apocalyptic', 'films', 'Postman.DVD', 'dirt', '-The', 'transfer', 'OK', 'not', 'great', 'not', 'terrible', 'can', 'tell', 'was', 'done', 'early', 'days', 'dual', 'layer', 'slight', 'hiccup', 'chapter', 'change', 'sections', 'film', 'seem', 'quite', 'dirty', 'obvious', 'splotches', 'scratches', 'sound', 'transfer', ""n't"", 'bad', 'voices', 'effects', 'are', ""n't"", 'mixed', 'properly', 'viewers', 'center-channel', 'system', 'can', 'simply', 'turn', 'speaker', 'up', 'will', 'experience', 'very', 'quiet', 'dialogue', 'very', 'loud', 'music', 'ear-blistering', 'explosions', 'seem', 'almost', 'place.The', 'only', 'extra', 'talking', 'quot', 'Postman', 'CGI', 'Route', 'quot', 'featurette', 'mostly', 'splicing', 'green-screened', 'actors', 'computer-touched-up', 'shots', 'landscapes', 'replacing', 'background', 'scenery', 'matte', 'images', 'still', 'frames', 'Nothing', 'terribly', 'special', 'featurette', 'only', '15', 'minutes', 'so']",N/A

105292,A19L4J82QJPY7B,0790736489,J. Gordon,"[4, 7]","Based on David Brin's novel of the same name, The Postman was Kevin Costner's second stab at the sci-fi/speculative fiction genre, although his film adaptation minimized the ""sci-fi"" elements to mostly the basic premise of a post-apocalyptic future.  While Costner's prior big budget sci-fi project, Waterworld, managed to eek out a bit of profit in the box office grosses, The Postman was not so lucky.  And to be honest, it's a shame, as The Postman is a much more human, likeable, believable, and flat-out better movie than Waterworld.While one professional movie critic at the time blindly accused The Postman of ""jingoism"", it's clear that this movie is pretty damn far from jingoistic.  In fact, the message and overall delivery is quite the opposite, in that it seeks to focus on the more humanitarian aspects of the existence of the United States, as opposed to reveling in military might or throwing out abstract and cliched statements about ""freedom"" in an attempt to imply some type of ""manifest destiny"".  The movie is set 16 or so years after a limited nuclear/biological war (that apparently lasted only 3 days) set off a spiral of chaotic breakdown in the U.S.  While the conflict's effect was apparently limited enough that the country's government could have weathered the storm normally, the rise of the Holnists, an alliance of racist, survivalist militia types, violently subverted the governments efforts to restore order, eventually leading to the burning of the White House, and the fall of the government.  Without the basic human services needed, the ensuing plagues and nuclear winter, combined with the predatory Holnist raids, served to drive the survivors of the mass riots and disasters into isolated communities.Costner's character, aka ""Shakespeare"", wanders the vast wilds of the American Northwest as the movie opens.  It appears that most of the aftereffects of the war have finally subsided by this point; however, the people are disconnected and isolated from each other, and lack the unity to rebuild what was lost.  The first part of the movie sets up Shakespeare as a likeable, unmotivated nomad, who ends up being drafted by force into the Holnist army while trying to put on the world's worst production of Shakespeare at a town, in exchange for food.  The Holnist leader, General Bethlehem (Will Patton, who was also in ""No Way Out"" with Costner), sees in Shakespeare a potential leader in his army of ""the strong"", but Shakespeare has other ideas, and manages to escape.  Lost in a torrential rainstorm, Shakespeare takes shelter in a crashed Postal Service truck, and appropriates a postman's uniform.  When he reaches the town of Pineview, Shakespeare, in an act of desperation, poses as a postman for what he terms ""The Restored United States Government"" in order to finagle some food and shelter.  The unforseen consequences of this act define the rest of the movie, as despite the fact that Shakespeare isn't the most convincing liar in the world, the people are desperate for any shred of hope, and any symbol that can give them reason to emerge from the frightened mode of existence they had been lost in for years.  And so, without giving too much away, Shakespeare unwittingly inspires the creation of a ragtag ""postal service"", and eventually accepts his role as the leader in a fight against Bethlehem's forces, and their attempts to maintain the chaotic, warlord-friendly status quo.It's true that the movie is earnest to a fault, and that earnestness tends to seep into sappiness at times (notably the much maligned ""letter hand-off"" scene involving his real-life son).  But a movie like this requires a sort of no-holds barred bravado to effectively work as a counterweight to the traditional ""patriotic"" movie, where machismo for its own sake is dressed up with abstracts such as ""fighting for freedom"".  I will gladly admit that, if done well enough, such as in the Rambo Trilogy, a macho patriotic movie can be worthwhile entertainment.  But The Postman's focus on the loss of what Americans take for granted, and how the drive to restore that sense of order and dignity can take root in one who has no desire to be a leader, but becomes one out of necessity, cuts to the heart of what is good in the United States far more effectively than any chest-beating, bullet-bedangled cinematic proclamation of the ""superiority"" of the United States could hope to.Like the movie itself, the performances are generally enthusiastic and likeable, if a bit un-nuanced.  Olivia Williams plays the obligatory love interest with a degree of strength, while Larenz Tate does a good job of embodying the naivete of someone who has finally found a positive symbol to follow (an interesting counterpoint to the ignorant thuggishness of the Holnist forces).  Will Patton's character is likewise interesting, as a former copier salesman with delusions of grandeur, who uses the fall of society to ascend, and carry on the Holnist's twisted crusade  oppression of the weak, who he feels have held back ""the strong"" for too long.  Costner himself is rather subdued...but then again, that's pretty his method of acting.One of the real stars here is the filmography itself.  By using a combination of vast sweeps of rugged wilderness, and carefully chosen isolated outposts of civilization, Costner and crew manage to convey a sense of scope and ""beautiful desolation"" that subtlely imply the departure of civilization, without having to show ruined cities, or much in the way of actual devastation.  The Blu Ray version does a good job of presenting these visuals in a sharp, clear manner, and also boosts the rather subdued audio levels that were present on the original DVD release.  I will say, however, that a rather significant opportunity was missed in this release- the lack of a commentary track.  A commentary track with both Kevin Costner and David Brin, discussing the diverging approaches of the book and the movie, as well as the troubled history of completing the project, would be a great addition.  Alas, we'll have to make do without.In any case, I recommend this release, to both fans and skeptics alike. Even Roger Ebert, who didn't recommend The Postman, appeared to respect the intentions and the effort put forth.  After all, its failings are substantially outweighed by its heart and earnestness, and sometimes, that's just good enough a reason to enjoy a movie.",4,Costner's Unfairly Maligned (If Flawed)

105297,AVWU1O6TH3SXG,0790736489,"J. McGinn ""HUNTSMAN""","[1, 3]","I recently saw this film again and decided to review it. In the mid and late 1990's Kevin Costner was a big star and a good actor who recently had both box office and critical success with Dances with Wolves, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Bodyguard and A Perfect World. Maybe Costner got a big ego or overestimated his star power, but he then went on to make three ambitious projects. He first made Wyatt Earp to counter Tombstone which he got dropped from. The film ended up to be a commercial and critical bomb. The next film he made was the very ambitious film Waterworld, which I believe would become at the time the most expensive film ever made. The film was a critical and box office bomb, but I think the film is very underrated. Is it a great film of course not with long stretches of time between action scenes and a bad supporting cast, but the film is still a decent film, and the director's cut is even better, and Dennis Hopper always plays a great bad guy. I highly recommend that if you see this film find the director's cut, but here I am going off topic. After the failures of Wyatt Earp and Waterworld his career was on a downward track which leads me to The Postman which was another ambitious project by Costner. Whether you like these films or not you have to give the actor credit for taking chances. Even though it was a critical and box office failure I enjoyed it. I saw it Christmas day when it opened in theaters in 1997 with my mother and stepfather. I do think just like Waterworld it is an underrated film.The film is based off of a novel with the same name by author David Brin. Now I have never read the novel. I have been meaning to for years, so I don't know how accurate it is to the book and can only judge the film. The film takes place in 2013 after a nuclear war in Europe, and global society collapses. The film takes place in the northwest US as only small pockets of civilization remains, with nomads, raiders and dictators roaming the country. One nomad (Kevin Costner) who's name is never given though he has nicknames like The Postman and Shakespeare. He wonders around to these pockets giving performances in exchange for supplies. Unfortunately for him on his travels he gets captured by an army controlled by General Bethlehem (Will Patton) and is forced into a labor camp. The nomad escapes and eventually hides in an old mail vehicle where you can guess he finds a postman's uniform. He uses the postman's uniform to easily gain access to settlements and says he's part of the newly restored government. The Postman is only using the scheme to get food, shelter and supplies and doesn't realize what he's starting or that Bethlehem won't be happy with this development as he has his own plans, and sets out to hunt down this Postman not realizing it's the same man who escaped from his camp. What ensues are two different ideals of the future as community's come together out of hope, freedom and friendship, while the other uses power and fear to dominate the people. The story is good. The only problem with the story is the film is long at nearly three hours and there is a lot of speeches and talking, and very few action scenes and the ones they have aren't really compelling with the climax of the film being the worst. If Costner who also directed this film added more compelling moments in this film I would have rated this higher.The acting in The Postman is really good with some great characters. I've got to first talk about Will Patton, because he is a great and I think under appreciated actor. Does the man have star looks or the draw power to lead his own film no, but he is an excellent supporting actor. In The Postman he does a great job as the main bad guy Bethlehem who before the collapse was I believe a salesman although I could be wrong with my memory. He brings to life his character with charm and cunning that you'd expect from the character. The actor has saved many films for me. The best example would be Armageddon. Patton played Chapple and was by far the best character in the film. Heck he even did a good job in the bad Gone in 60 seconds. Then there is James Russo (Captain Idaho) who does great job as Bethlehem's right hand man. The actor always does a good job playing a bad guy. Was this Costner's best acting performance no, but the he does a pretty good job playing the wandering Nomad who doesn't want to get involved in the mess he created, but ends up leading people to unite and create a new nation. Let's not forget Tom Petty who has a small fun role as he plays his future self.I really talk much about the action as I've talked about the pacing of the film already. I will say the action is the worst part of the film and hurts the overall rating of the film the most. Instead I will talk about the cinematography. When I first saw the film back in Alexandria, VA I loved it, but I didn't have a real appreciation for it. Now that I live in Portland, OR I have a better appreciation and love for it. It was beautifully filmed in the northwest United States including Arizona, Oregon and Washington. The western and northwest part of the United States is the most beautiful parts of the country and everyone should come visit these parts of the country.Costner is a good director and has proven so with his three films he's directed in Dances with Wolves, The Postman and Open Range. The Postman is his worst directing job. Being in charge he should have done something with the pacing of the film, but otherwise he did a pretty good job directing the film. To be honest I'm not sure why he hasn't directed more films.The Postman isn't a excellent film, but it is a really good film with a good story, but bad pacing. A really good cast, great cinematography, bad action and pretty good directing. I think people should give this film a chance, especially if you want a change from the same old post-apocalyptic films they come out now. I don't think you'll be disappointed. Did Costner career take a downward turn after this film and the other ones yes, but you can fault the actor for taking a risk so few actors and studios are willing to do now a days. Again try The Postman, and while you're at it Waterworld. Both are underrated and unappreciated, and I don't think you'll be disappointed.",4,The Postman Cometh,1350086400,"10 13, 2012",2012,6300,"['recently', 'saw', 'film', 'again', 'decided', 'review',

Kevin Costner (JFK, WATERWORLD, ROBIN HOOD : PRINCE OF THIEVES) is the most underrated actor/director of my generation. I can't think of a single film  he has been in that wasn't good (okay, okay DRAGONFLY sucked!) and THE POSTMAN is no exception. A truly epic film based on the novel by David Brin, begins in the year 2013 and follows a drifter played by Costner (who also directed the film) wondering a vast wateland. America we learn was ravaged by war in the late 20th century by an army of fascist warlords called ""The Holnists"" led by Nathan Holm (whom we never see, only learn about). The United States government has been overthrown, there is no technology and earth's suvivors have scattered into tiny hamlets across the country. Costner's character & his mule named ""Bill"" travel from village to village where he preforms Shakesperian plays in order to get food and shelter. It is after performing one such play that Costner's character known as Shakespeare (we never learn his true name) is captured by the Holnist army when they raid the village to get three men from ages ""between 15 & 50"". The army now led by the evil General Bethleham, played brilliantly by Will Patton (THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES, ARMAGEDDON, REMEMBER THE TITANS)is now an army basically comprised of murderers, rapists and anarchists. Shakespeare escapes, and in a heartbreaking scene finds shelter from a storm in an old mail carrier's vehicle. He then takes the dead postman's uniform and begins traveling from village to village telling people that he is a representative of the ""Restored United States Government, authorized by ""order 417"" to reestablish a communication route. The problem is that EVERYONE believes him and a legend begins that inspires hope in  people who have not known it for a long, long time. Once Shakepeare realizes what he has done he leads a rebellion of postmen in a battle to defeat the Holnists and reestablish a country destroyed by violence. This is truly a film of epic proportions that is one of the best films of the 1990's. I emplore everyone to see it despite what you may have heard. A+.

I promise this film would have been greeted with a much friendlier audience if not for it's timing.Not that it doesn't have short-comings. It has the Costner-esque three hour length, which probably isn't as necessary here as it was in &quot;Dances With Wolves,&quot; and the editing is a bit choppy, and sometimes the flow and pace slacks off a little. Strip these things away and you have a solid commentary on the aspect of hope, group dynamics, and the psychology of leadership.Costner's role is decent enough, though the film is taken away by the stellar performance of Will Patton (&quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;No Way Out,&quot; &amp; CBS' excellent but mistakenly canceled show &quot;The Agency&quot;). Patton's role pushes both borders of intellect and insanity, all the while holding on to some inner-confidence which drives him.It's so easy to jump on the wagon and label this film a disaster, when the truth is that it gets better with each viewing, and sticks with you for hours and even days after the TV is turned off.

105313,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0790736489,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[0, 1]","I might be alone in thinking this, but I thought ""The Postman"" needed to be longer.  In fact, I think Kevin Costner's post-apocalyptic epic needed to be a television mini-series.  There really were not any special effects or scenes that necessarily needed the big screen.  Whatever its faults, at 177 minutes ""The Postman"" does not rush the evolution of the character from a wandering performer of Shakespeare for the huddled masses into the title character.  Of course, after the fiasco of ""Waterworld"" it is impossible for audiences not to compare this film to that one.  After all, they are both films about a dystopian future in which the Costner character is a loner who gets drawn into a pivotal fight regarding the fate of civilization.  True, ""The Postman"" is not on the same level of ""Dances With Wolves,"" but by the same token it is a lot better than ""Waterworld.""The greater sin of this film would be the predictability.  We know from the title that Kevin Costner is going to become the Postman.  When he is shanghaied into being a member of the Holmist army of General Bethlehem (Will Patton), a copier-salesman with delusions of grandeur who has come to power in the Pacific Northwest, as soon as the tyrant general explains the rules of his clan we know what the climax of the film is going to be.  Then again, everybody knew the ship was going to sink in ""Titanic.""  Ultimately ""The Postman"" is about something bigger than Kevin Costner's character, it is just that nothing is rally bigger than the actor-director in this film.Credit for the basic idea goes to science fiction writer David Brin, who wrote the novel on which the film is based.  Unlike most dystopian fiction, Brin gets farther down the road towards the return to normalcy (compare it to the classic novels in the genre like ""1984,"" ""Fahrenheit 451,"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale"" where there is just the barest hint of hope).  Costner's character gets a lucky break and is able to escape from Bethlehem's fascist army, at which point he discovers a postal uniform and a satchel of mail.  He uses these as a guise for getting into one of the walled cities and finding a free meal.  Years of telling the tales of the Bard has made him capable of spinning yarns and he creates the fiction of a restored national government (the name of the president should have a ring to it).  But unlike his telling of ""MacBeth,"" this story has a profound and unexpected reaction in those who listen.  Underneath the trappings, ""The Postman"" is a film where a man finds his lies becoming the truth.It is also a film in which the ordinary people, the characters other than the Postman and his opponent, are given a chance to live their lives and start to recreate their world.  The Postman's tall tales found one true believer in young Ford Lincoln Mercury (Larenz Tate), a young man whose dream of driving cars has found something else to inspire him and others.  This is where a longer version of the film would benefit.  We do not need any more of Costner's transformation or the strange path his relationship takes with Abby (Olivia Williams), nor are there any additional insights to be gleamed by an extended to the little mind of Bethlehem (although more about farmer Holm would be appreciated).

Putting all that material back in for a director's cut could not hurt the film.  The predictable ending, the indulgent moment where the Postman grabs a letter from a kid, will still all be there.

105318,A3O2RCKAMSE9X7,0790736489,Martin Asiner,"[1, 2]","Fans who pan THE POSTMAN tend to judge Kevin Costner by his poor performance in WATERWORLD. In this later movie, he plays a web-footed loner who seeks dry land as a sort of gritty Holy Grail. Costner as the Postman again was the loner, but this time he embodies a stirring rebirth of hope that his female lead Olivia Williams says, that he 'dispenses like candy... The film glorifies in an unabashed way the virtues of the good old USA in a manner that had been often pilloried and ridiculed as the politically correct version of patriotism--at least until 9-11. The stirring cavalry charge of American men and women that concludes the movie brings to mind a similar earlier charge made at Balaklava Heights in the Crimea. Errol Flynn led that one in THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.To be fair to the negative critics of the movie, there are flaws to THE POSTMAN that cannot be overlooked. It is excessively long, cliche ridden, and filled with a plethora of secondary characters that ought not to have been included in the first place... There is the individual vignette of heroism, often between the nameless postman and his evil opponent, effectively portrayed by Will Paton... And then there is the patriotism that infuses the entire second half, culminating in the cavalry charge. Yet, these plusses by themselves cannot account for the film's current positive reappraisal. To me, as I see THE POSTMAN in repeated viewings, I see a political and psychological subtext. In THE POSTMAN Costner represents this deep yearning of both resident hopeless character within the film and each member of the audience to find a paradigm of longlasting order and rule, not the rule of a few simple barbaric laws as postulated by the General, but the rules of an ordered society as the one that Costner suggests can still be resuscitated if only they maintain the faith that such a revival is possible. Each scene from the first confrontation between the postman and the General to the postman's finding that sack of US mail to the climactic confrontation between the forces of order and disorder as exemplified respectively by the postman and the General, all coalesce to emphasize the need to bring order out of disorder. When a movie like THE POSTMAN makes this point as stirringly as it does, then most viewers are inclined to overlook the errors and just plain bad acting of key performers. What we have then, is a movie that is much better than it seemed just a few years ago. And this just points out the need to occasionally re-evaluate that which we thought we knew for sure.",3,The Postman: The Allegory of Order,1024185600,"06 16, 2002",2002,2575,"['Fans', 'who', 'pan', 'POSTMAN', 'tend', 'judge', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'poor', 'performance', 'WATERWORLD', 'later', 'movie', 'web-footed', 'loner', 'who', 'dry', 'land', 'sort', 'gritty', 'Holy', 'Grail', 'Costner', 'Postman', 'again', 'was', 'loner', 'time', 'stirring', 'rebirth', 'hope', 'female', 'lead', 'Olivia', 'Williams', 'candy', 'film', 'glorifies', 'unabashed', 'way', 'virtues', 'good', 'old', 'USA', 'manner', 'had', 'been', 'often', 'pilloried', 'ridiculed', 'politically', 'correct', 'version', 'patriotism', 'least', '9-11', 'stirring', 'cavalry', 'charge', 'American', 'men', 'women', 'movie', 'mind', 'similar', 'earlier', 'charge', 'made', 'Balaklava', 'Heights', 'Crimea', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'led', 'one', 'CHARGE', 'THE', 'LIGHT', 'BRIGADE.To', 'be', 'fair', 'negative', 'critics', 'movie', 'are', 'flaws', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'overlooked', 'excessively', 'long', 'cliche', 'ridden', 'filled', 'plethora', 'secondary', 'characters', 'ought', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'included', 'first', 'place', 'individual', 'vignette', 'heroism', 'often', 'nameless', 'postman', 'evil', 'opponent', 'effectively', 'portrayed', 'Will', 'Paton', 'then', 'patriotism', 'entire', 'second', 'half', 'culminating', 'cavalry', 'charge', 'plusses', 'can', 'not', 'account', 'film', 'current', 'positive', 'reappraisal', 'see', 'POSTMAN', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'see', 'political', 'psychological', 'subtext', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'Costner', 'deep', 'yearning', 'resident', 'hopeless', 'character', 'film', 'member', 'audience', 'find', 'paradigm', 'longlasting', 'order', 'rule', 'not', 'rule', 'few', 'simple', 'barbaric', 'laws', 'postulated', 'General', 'rules', 'ordered', 'society', 'one', 'Costner', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'resuscitated', 'only', 'maintain', 'faith', 'revival', 'possible', 'scene', 'first', 'confrontation', 'postman', 'General', 'postman', 'finding', 'sack', 'US', 'mail', 'climactic', 'confrontation', 'forces', 'order', 'disorder', 'exemplified', 'respectively', 'postman', 'General', 'coalesce', 'emphasize', 'need', 'bring', 'order', 'disorder', 'When', 'movie', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'point', 'as', 'stirringly', 'then', 'most', 'viewers', 'are', 'inclined', 'overlook', 'errors', 'just', 'plain', 'bad', 'acting', 'key', 'performers', 'What', 'have', 'then', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'seemed', 'just', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'just', 'out', 'need', 'occasionally', 're-evaluate', 'thought', 'knew', 'sure']",N/A

The most moving being the final battle scene, where the war is settled by a one on one fight between as the Postman describes them, ""the a** holes who started it"".The only time the length of the movie is evident is during the scenes with the love interest, which really don't add up to much by the conclusion of the film.Again the best part of this movie is its length, which allows the viewer to understand the back story of the characters and in turn appreciate the point of view and needs of each.While not acheiving the status of an epic film, there are some emotional moments and characters you care about.Give it a watch.",4,The film's length is it's legacy,1209427200,"04 29, 2008",2008,1272,"['Postman', 'long', 'movie', 'length', 'create', 'desperate', 'tone', 'movie', 'bring', 'world', 'characters.The', 'post-apocalyptic', 'reality', 'film', 'presents', 'somewhat', 'plausible', 'really', 'brought', 'life', 'individual', 'characters', 'Postman', 'way.From', 'townspeople', 'who', 'thinking', 'postman', 'fellow', 'Holenest', 'recruits', 'Mayor', 'Tom', 'Petty', 'character', 'unique', 'something', 'being', 'inspiration', 'hero.Of', 'course', 'most', 'memorable', 'moments', 'are', 'featuring', 'copy', 'salesman', 'turned', 'military', 'leader', 'General', 'Bethlehem', 'most', 'moving', 'being', 'final', 'battle', 'scene', 'where', 'war', 'settled', 'one', 'one', 'fight', 'Postman', 'a**', 'holes', 'who', 'started', 'only', 'time', 'length', 'movie', 'evident', 'scenes', 'love', 'interest', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'much', 'conclusion', 'film.Again', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'length', 'viewer', 'understand', 'back', 'story', 'characters', 'turn', 'appreciate', 'point', 'view', 'needs', 'each.While', 'not', 'acheiving', 'status', 'epic', 'film', 'are', 'emotional', 'moments', 'characters', 'care', 'about.Give', 'watch']",N/A

However, I was mistaken, as this is actually a nice film.The plot is based on the same post-apocalypse films that many are based around; however, this film is a bit different.  For example, Will Patton (now remembered for Remember the Titans) plays a ruthless leader of a ""feudal"" style tribe or gang if you will.  He takes money from the poor; in return he promises not to hurt them, too badly at least.However, as most ruthless groups do, this one had some dissenters, mainly Kevin Costner's character.  Initially starting as a forced member of the gang, Costner's character assumes a role as a postman and begins to give new life to the terrorized communities.  The question is though will he succeed?Now, this film is clearly long enough (runtime just under 3 hours) to be filled with all kinds of excitement, and it is.  Now, there are not any complicated subplots really, but the development of the story takes some time.  I do not know what really touches one about this film though.  Maybe it is the theme of dogged determination, hope in hard times, or just the archetypal hero, a.k.a. the Postman.Either way, I am sure that most will enjoy this film, if you can just squeak through the long parts.

It is true but dull.I love the Brin book. I also really like the film depite its differecens and agree with other reviewers that if fixes certain elements of the book.Was the dialog occasionally clunky? Yup. Was the supporting cast inconsistent? Yep. Costner would have looked better with a better support beyond the villian.And some scenes came off hokey (I'm lookin at you Tom Petty).But the basis is so compelling; a reluctant hero and the symbolism of a postman after societal collpase.I'd also gripe about the sets. The kennicot mine in Utah is ugly and they managed to make oregon look kinda ugly as well (next time film in western Oregon not eastern please). I realize you think need desolation but it wasn't that they were just ugly, they were ...dull. As someone who lived in the west, who hasn't seen these places? You can't just point a camera at a pace we all know. It's not like they lacked a budget. Anyway, minor gripe.I am a fan of this genre. Post-apocalyptic fiction leaves me feeling inspired as it looks at what actually matters in a civilization. Abd for me the ultimate test of how good a movie is is if I want to see it again ....and again. And I do. when this comes on movie channels I am sucked in. I also like to watch it on Amazon Prime (shamless plug). I thought initially that Avatar was a much better movie yet I zero desire to have to watch it again. It was crappy scifi in my opinion.

105349,A3MCQSIBV7QW8Q,0790736489,Priscilla Stafford,"[2, 6]","In this 1997 film, Kevin Costner plays the Postman (his name is really never revealed) in a post-apocalyptic world. In the year 2013, there is no United States government and people exist in villages scattered all over America. With no actual government, the Holnist group lead by General Bethlehem (Will Patton) who establishes himself as a sort of warlord. Having a tyrannical reign over the villages, he murders, harasses, steals, while having tight control over the people by instilling fear. But General Bethlehem is in for a change when he recruits a Shakespearean performer (Kevin Costner) to his army. When the performer escapes, to keep himself warm he climbs into a broken down mail truck and trades clothes with the clothes of a dead US postal worker. He comes upon a village then assuming the identity of 'the postman', convinces the people that there is a new restored United States government. His only thought is to get some food and shelter from the village so he is surprised when he finds the people of ""Pineville"" are now filled with a newfound hope. Before he knows it, he has inspired a whole legion of young and old to begin a postal service in the whole Pacific Northwest region of America! Will the Postman, a liar and a con man, help the people and also believe in the hope that he himself gave from his lies?As I wrote in the title for my review, ""The Postman"" was a lot better than the reviews had made out. The main points for the reason for all the dislikes were 1) bad acting, 2) bad directing, 3) not enough editing), and 4) a poor plot. I'd like to go through these points in my review.I have always like Kevin Costner's acting, especially in ""Silverado"", ""Field of Dreams"", and ""Tin Cup"" (Both ""Waterworld"" and ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" were mediocre films). I have even seen ""Inside Actors Studio"" with Kevin Costner and I really found him a likable person, he was very funny and had me laughing! (Also, Kevin Costner is pretty famous in Japan, doing many advertisements and his movies are pretty well-known.) So for me I was very impressed with Kevin Costner's character in ""The Postman"". In the beginning you can just what an intelligent and smart character he plays, yet he hides it from the General the villagers. I loved his one-sided conversations with Bill the mule. :) But I must admit, some of the lines he gave out were a bit cheesy and corny. But his character has plenty of development. In the beginning he tries to get around his responsibilities but finally in the end he accepts his destiny and takes up the responsibilities of a leader.As for the other characters in the movie, they were also acted out well. General Bethlehem played by Will Patton was a good 'bad guy' character. Though a lunatic, whenever Patton gave glimpses of his intelligences, he did them so well! Then we have Ford Lincoln Mercury (named after a car dealership) played by Larenz Tate. He was a 'so-so' character, at times I felt he could have acted better but on the over-all he was good. And of course, I thought that Olivia Williams (most well-known as Bruce Willis's wife in ""The Sixth Sense"") as Abby, Kevin Costner's love interest acted her part very well! The beginning of their relationship was at first very lame (I won't go into any details), but I kind of loved their bickering in the middle of the movie, especially when they fight in the cabin. But true love is really best shown at the end where she tells the Postman that she loves him. Oh, but her best scene is when she picks up her rifle and starts shooting at General Bethlehem! Priceless! You don't see many strong woman characters like her. (A bit of trivia, near the end of the movie there's the character credited 'Bridge City Mayor' who is played by Tom Petty, a very famous rock musician.)As for the story, I found it extremely interesting. Some people complained it being a bit too long (about 3 hours long) and that it should have been edited a lot. But for me, I actually like to watch long movies if they're interesting and I don't mind sitting through a 3 hour movie (wasn't ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" pretty terrific? I wouldn't cut ANYTHING out!). And same with ""The Postman"", I really wouldn't want to edit too much, the story actually flowed pretty well. But it all depends on the person, some people enjoy shorter movies, some like longer movies. I liked the plot, ultimately showing the patriotism and independence of the people and the strength they have when faced with terrible circumstances. The conclusion of ""The Postman"" was very satisfying.The directing was great, the photography and camera work also exceptionally well-done. It's true, I though the camera work was terrific. Best example to give you is when the postal carriers ride together then split up. The camera work is done from the air looking down upon the riders. When the riders split up it was very cool to watch!So, that's my review for ""The Postman"". I enjoyed the movie for the great qualities it had, some great acting, terrific camera work, a pretty sound plot, and nice editing. But of course everyone has different preferences so I cannot guarantee everyone will like it. Just don't ever try to think it similar to ""Waterworld""! ""The Postman"" for me was a lot better than ""Waterworld"". The movie is R-rated and I do agree that it was rated fairly and correctly. Very violent though not too gory, though it had its moments. Also there is one 'love' scene between the Postman and Abby which I thought was a bit unnecessary so you can skip through it without missing anything.",4,A lot better than the reviews make

105354,A1XZJ32DJS8YV2,0790736489,"R. M. Williams ""just an avid reader""","[5, 9]","movie review -- the PostmanI saw it when it first came out, had the opportunity to watch it again this evening.It's the motivation for hope that interests me most about the movieThe movie is about hope, the kind of hope and strength that comes from believing in something worthwhile and greater than yourself and your immediate gratification.What is curious is that the plot really proposes a hope in hope, akin to the modern ideas of a faith in faith itself. The content of either is really kind of unimportant, the only thing that seems important is the strength with which you hold to the hope or faith.He is a fraud. A mild con man, out for a meal and a warm place to sleep. The post system is build by a teenager with a strong hero worship and a great imagination. He too is a fraud, making up letters from the postman to set rules and motivate the postal riders. In some magic way this hope in hope, this faith in faith, transmogrifies itself into a heroic army that sweeps down on horseback to blow the bad guys away. phoey! doesn't it matter if people believe a lie or believe the truth? isn't the content of hope, the object of faith important?It is a clever plot with enough action and adventure to involve people in watching it. It's not a bad movie, but it really is indicative of the current mentality that faith, hope and love will conquer all, no matter what the content of either is. The orange army, the bad guys, had hope as well. Hope to live another day, hope to watch the flicks that night, and the hope for some loot in raiding the rest of the devastated and depopulated countryside. The leader, the general of the bad guys really had the most hope of all-hope that he would rule and impose his will on everyone around him and knock down anyone who dared stand up to him.I propose that the object of love, the reason for hope and the content of faith is important. Many of the most motivated and evil people that ever lived had lots of hope, lots of faith, often in themselves and as much love as the next guy. I suppose that those men that devastated this apocalyptic world had lots of hope that they were right, the enemy was wrong and their case just and they virtually destroyed their world. It's all too much like the proverbial airplane pilot that reports to the passengers that he has good news and bad news. The good news is that they are making excellent time, the bad news is that they are hopelessly lost. Great hope and faith in the service of evil is more than wasted it is what makes for so much conflict and evil in this world. People who are completely convinced that their hope and faith is something that i must share or .... . The content of faith, the object and reason for hope is important.The movie tries to make the connection between home and hearth, between a warm bed with a beautiful wife and the patriotic feelings towards the national state. But it is a sleight of hand trick, the nation state, the big conglomerates of power, this belongs to the evil, orange soldier guys, not to peaceful farmers or really small communities. I can't help but think of the book: The Parable of the Tribes, those evil ones who fight to control and rule over others, they change and shape the world into their image, as force seems the only way to meet force, violence the only way to defeat the violent. It's a stirring enough movie, but it is misdirected, hope and faith are important things, but the object of those very necessary and very human strivings are likewise important.It is necessary not just to have hope, but to have hope in things that are true. It is necessary to love, but to love the right people for the right reasons. It is necessary to have faith, but the object and content of the faith must be in real things, things that are worthwhile having faith, hope and love place in them, or towards them. Faith in faith, or hope in hope may very well motivate people to rise above themselves and do heroic things, but it also is fraught with potential to me misguided or worse yet manipulated by those evil ones. Everyone in the orange jumpsuits wasn't impressed and forced to be there, some were there genuinely because they loved, hoped and had faith in their leaders and in their cause. This is the way faith, hope and love are double edged knifes, you can and do have people who are sincerely and whole heartedly committed to false and ignoble causes, ready to die, and worse yet kill for their objects of their misplaced but certainly bold faith.Well, it's just a movie and not a philosophic treatise, although it is nearly as long as some. But it is worth thinking about and considering, good and evil, the constant battle that swirls around and often through us, the sides don't really differ in the intensity of their desires, but only in the object of them.",4,what is important enough to hope for? does it matter if it is true?,1184716800,"07 18, 2007",2007,4817,"['movie', 'review', 'PostmanI', 'saw', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'again', 'evening.It', 'motivation', 'hope', 'interests', 'most', 'movieThe', 'movie', 'hope', 'kind', 'hope', 'strength', 'believing', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'greater', 'immediate', 'gratification.What', 'curious', 'plot', 'really', 'hope', 'hope', 'akin', 'modern', 'ideas', 'faith', 'faith', 'content', 'really', 'kind', 'unimportant', 'only', 'thing', 'important', 'strength', 'hold', 'hope', 'faith.He', 'fraud', 'mild', 'con', 'man', 'meal', 'warm', 'place', 'sleep', 'post', 'system', 'build', 'teenager', 'strong', 'hero', 'worship', 'great', 'imagination', 'too', 'fraud', 'making', 'up', 'letters', 'postman', 'set', 'rules', 'motivate', 'postal', 'riders', 'magic', 'way', 'hope', 'hope', 'faith', 'faith', 'heroic', 'army', 'down', 'horseback', 'blow', 'bad', 'guys', 'away', 'phoey', ""n't"", 'matter', 'people', 'believe', 'lie', 'believe', 'truth', ""n't"", 'content', 'hope', 'object', 'faith', 'important', 'clever', 'plot', 'enough', 'action', 'adventure', 'involve', 'people', 'watching', 'not', 'bad', 'movie', 'really', 'indicative', 'current', 'mentality', 'faith', 'hope', 'love', 'will', 'conquer', 'matter', 'what', 'content', 'orange', 'army', 'bad', 'guys', 'had', 'hope', 'as', 'well', 'Hope', 'live', 'day', 'hope', 'watch', 'flicks', 'night', 'hope', 'loot', 'raiding', 'rest', 'devastated', 'depopulated', 'countryside', 'leader', 'general', 'bad', 'guys', 'really', 'had', 'most', 'hope', 'all-hope', 'would', 'rule', 'impose', 'will', 'everyone', 'knock', 'down', 'anyone', 'who', 'dared', 'stand', 'up', 'him.I', 'propose', 'object', 'love', 'reason', 'hope', 'content', 'faith', 'important', 'Many', 'most', 'motivated', 'evil', 'people', 'ever', 'lived', 'had', 'lots', 'hope', 'lots', 'faith', 'often', 'as', 'much', 'love', 'next', 'guy', 'suppose', 'men', 'devastated', 'apocalyptic', 'world', 'had', 'lots', 'hope', 'were', 'right', 'enemy', 'was', 'wrong', 'case', 'just', 'virtually', 'destroyed', 'world', 'too', 'much', 'proverbial', 'airplane', 'pilot', 'passengers', 'good', 'news', 'bad', 'news', 'good', 'news', 'are', 'making', 'excellent', 'time', 'bad', 'news', 'are', 'hopelessly', 'lost', 'Great', 'hope', 'faith', 'service', 'evil', 'more', 'wasted', 'what', 'so', 'much', 'conflict', 'evil', 'world', 'People', 'who', 'are', 'completely', 'convinced', 'hope', 'faith', 'something', 'i', 'must', 'share', 'content', 'faith', 'object', 'reason', 'hope', 'important.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'make', 'connection', 'home', 'hearth', 'warm', 'bed', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'patriotic', 'feelings', 'national', 'state', 'sleight', 'hand', 'trick', 'nation', 'state', 'big', 'conglomerates', 'power', 'evil', 'orange', 'soldier', 'guys', 'not', 'peaceful', 'farmers', 'really', 'small', 'communities', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'book', 'Parable', 'Tribes', 'evil', 'ones', 'who', 'fight', 'control', 'rule', 'others', 'change', 'shape', 'world', 'image', 'force', 'only', 'way', 'meet', 'force', 'violence', 'only', 'way', 'defeat', 'violent', 'stirring', 'enough', 'movie', 'misdirected', 'hope', 'faith', 'are', 'important', 'things', 'object', 'very', 'necessary', 'very', 'human', 'strivings', 'are', 'likewise', 'important.It', 'necessary', 'not', 'just', 'have', 'hope', 'have', 'hope', 'things', 'are', 'true', 'necessary', 'love', 'love', 'right', 'people', 'right', 'reasons', 'necessary', 'have', 'faith', 'object', 'content', 'faith', 'must', 'be', 'real', 'things', 'things', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'having', 'faith', 'hope', 'love', 'place', 'towards', 'Faith', 'faith', 'hope', 'hope', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'motivate', 'people', 'rise', 'do', 'heroic', 'things', 'also', 'fraught', 'potential', 'misguided', 'worse', 'yet', 'manipulated', 'evil', 'ones', 'Everyone', 'orange', 'jumpsuits', 'was', ""n't"", 'impressed', 'forced', 'be', 'there', 'were', 'there', 'genuinely', 'loved', 'hoped', 'had', 'faith', 'leaders', 'cause', 'way', 'faith', 'hope', 'love', 'are', 'double', 'edged', 'knifes', 'can', 'do', 'have', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'sincerely', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'committed', 'false', 'ignoble', 'causes', 'ready', 'die', 'worse', 'yet', 'kill', 'objects', 'misplaced', 'certainly', 'bold', 'faith.Well', 'just', 'movie', 'not', 'philosophic', 'treatise', 'nearly', 'as', 'long', 'worth', 'thinking', 'considering', 'good', 'evil', 'constant', 'battle', 'swirls', 'often', 'sides', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'differ', 'intensity', 'desires', 'only', 'object']",N/A
105355,A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO,0790736489,Robert Badgley,"[0, 1]","The Postman(released Dec/97) is a decent entry from Kevin Costner,who co-produced and starred in the leading role.The film clocks in at around a hefty 178 minutes but,as most good movies go,one does not notice its passage.The story takes place at around this time in a world where a plague has wiped out much of human civilization.What is left are scared pockets of humanity entrenched behind walls or atop old dams,trying to stave off those that would try to take what little they have left.Enter Gordon Krantz(Costner) who is a drifter eking out an existence,living hand to mouth on whatever he can find to survive on.When he reaches a settlement he puts on plays of Shakespeare with the help of his donkey.One day at such a settlement he is confronted by an ""army"" led by a sadistic Capt.Bethlehem(Will Patton).They are basically a band of marauders living off the avails of townsfolk who they harass.He is ""conscripted"" into this ersatz army and branded as one by a figure eight on his right arm.Krantz does not go gently into that good night and,through some harrowing moments,manages to escape Bethlehem's clutches.One night he comes upon an old abandoned mail truck with its' skeletonized driver still in place.He passes the time reading old mail but gets an idea.From here on in he will pass him self off as a postman who is now a direct rep of a new United States government led by a fictitious President Starkey.The first town he comes to is Pineview,Oregon.Here he washes up,is fed and is propositioned by a local woman named Abby(Olivia Williams).It seems her husband is sterile and they want a child very badly and both agree to her sleeping with Krantz to make their dream come true.Krantz unsure at first,eventually succumbs to the ladies charm and the deed is done.Krantz is pressed by an eager local,one Ford Mercury Lincoln(Larenz Tate),to become a postman like him.Unable to bluff his way out,he makes him a postman.When Krantz leaves the town it is beset soon after by Bethlehem's army and Olivia's husband is killed for refusing the general ""access"" to his wife.The local post office is burned and Olivia is taken prisoner for the general's pleasure.Ford Lincoln Mercury is determined to carry on his duties and leaves Pineview.He sets up a ""centre"" elsewhere and recruits volunteers to become postmen and women,who in turn pick up,carry and deliver mail to become conduits for a broader communications link between settlements;spreading Krantz's falsehood to even greater lengths.In the meantime Bethlehem is getting tired of this new movement and tries to crush it everywhere he finds it.Krantz,along with Olivia,flee his reach but everywhere they go Krantz runs into signs of his expanding legacy.Finally Krantz reaches the centre Lincoln Mercury has set up.Krantz gives Mercury a dressing down for what he has done but the ""mission"" has become bigger than either of them.Trouble is postmen are now not returning from their ""appointed rounds""as Bethlehem and his army are catching up and killing whatever postmen they find in order to destroy the movement.Circumstances build up on Krantz and his charges and eventually he can run no longer and decides to bring the fight to Bethlehem.Both sides meet on open ground and it is here Krantz invokes one of Bethlehem's own laws against him;he challenges him mano et mano for leadership.It is a close contest but Krantz comes out the victor and ends the violence once and for all.The film's opening scenes which had been narrated by Krantz's daughter,now end with a scene in 2043 where she is dedicating a statue to her late father.It depicts her father on a horse riding towards a boy with his arm outstretched with a letter in his hand.The boy,now grownup,is there to say that was him.The action throughout ebbs and flows nicely with little slow downs evident.There is a scene though that has me wondering.When Krantz first tries to enter Pineview he is confronted by a wall and a townsfolk quite reluctant to let him enter.However when Bethlehem and his army come in we are just shown them strolling merrily down the main street;no challenges,no nothing.Hmm.That minor point aside the movie is very enjoyable and all involved do a bang up job.Technically the movie has been transferred nicely and is crisp and clear,in its original widescreen a/r.Extras include the trailer,special effects sequences featurette with commentary by their creators and production notes.One point of contention I found was with the sub titles.It seems they are on,in default.It took quite a learning curve to 1)find out where they were(in ""languages""!) and 2) to get to know how to shut them off.Poor design.All in all a good movie of its genre and Costner and company do a bang up job in all departments.Recommended.",4,An enjoyable post apocalyptic drama,1304208000,"05 1, 2011",2011,4768,"['Postman', 'released', 'Dec/97', 'decent',

105356,A3N3SN2DDD4HCJ,0790736489,Robert Blake,"[0, 2]","&quot;The Postman&quot; is a surprisingly bad movie for Kevin Costner to direct after his 1990 triumph, &quot;Dances With Wolves.&quot; I mean, we wait so many years for this talented artist to make another film and this  is what we get? It's also surprising that it was written by two of  Hollywood's brightest writers, Eric Roth, who recently co-wrote with  Michael Mann the absolutely riveting thriller, &quot;The Insider,&quot; and  Brian Helgeland, who co-wrote the gorgeous noir detective thriller,  &quot;L.A. Confidential.&quot; &quot;The Postman&quot; has a good heart,  but not a good brain. The story is too unbelievable, maybe it's not  unbelievable, just uninteresting. There's too much material that seems  uneeded, unimportant, like the angle about the woman who has sex with The  Postman because her husband is unable to produce offspring. The characters  are unconvincing and perpostrous really. So much that the villain has to be  supplied lines obviously inspired by &quot;Braveheart&quot; to try and  spice up the tension. And when scenes pretend to be inspiring or exciting,  they're so perpostrous in that mood that you feel an urge to laugh. Sure  the production is well-done, with some great outdoor vistas, and the score  is allright, but the screenplay is too...well, dumb seems to mean  considering Costner really thought this was a good story that would  actually entertain. The big problem here above all is that the film is too  long. I love 3 hour movies that are great like &quot;JFK,&quot;  &quot;Schindler's List&quot; and &quot;Nixon,&quot; but those were riveting  movies with riveting stories.

Crawford,"[0, 1]","This is the first on-line film I've watched, in part because I bought a blu ray version and they ""offered"" this one, though I find such  multi-format packages annoying in that we do in fact pay for them.  Why tack on something you don't need, like a DVD version when you only want the bluray, if not to jack up the price?  Suffice to say, the picture was inferior and reminded me why I prefer manual players.Alas, this is not as good a film as I had hoped.  I have a great admiration for the imaginative mind of David Brin, truly one of the most brilliant of the new wave hard scifi writers of the 1980s.  His plots are intricate, scientifically accurate, and wonderfully engaging in plot and character.  So I was very curious about to see a film based on one of his oeuvre.This is a what-happens-when-everything-breaks-down story.  There are baddies who develop a military dictatorship, complete with laws, a culture, and extreme and cyncial brutality.  They take whatever they want and represent one possible future.  They prey on the tiny human settlements that have survived and are preserving a modicum of human decency.Throw into this mess a consequential individual, the Kostner character.  I will not go into the quirks of his character, but they are significant and frankly a delightful surprise.  Unfortunately, this is the only glimmer of the Brin brilliance - the story is simplified into a potboiler, the scientific details do not fit into a great whole (as they surely would have done in the novel), and most of the other characters remain under-developed.  To boot, it is too long at 3 hours.Recommended tepidly.

105358,A18TSDA9ZRLKVM,0790736489,"Robert S. ""geek hipster""","[1, 5]","Chances are, if you're reading this, you're a fan of this movie.The Postman has a small cult following, probably because as ham-handed as the western motifs that nearly overwhelm the simple patriotic message are, they don't drown it out, and on repeat viewings, this message is.. (in this reviewers opinion) welcome & and noticably missing from alot of film today. Costner's character is an unnamed drifter who wanders thru Oregon in 2013, years after a nuclear winter has devastated the country and left it to the terror tactics of an army of racially intolerant neo-fascists who base their lives on the self-help book of a long dead motivational speaker. Will Patton is a great villain in this film as the quiet, brooding General Bethlehem. After narrowly escaping being conscripted by them, he seeks shelter in an abandoned Mail delivery truck, and borrows the clothes and mailbag of the dead postman to pretend to be a representative of the 'restored Congress of the United States', presumably to gain favor with people and score some free food and board.  This ruse, of course, only ends up generating hope in the poor villagers he comes across, and starts to become bigger than him...  and that idea is the charm of the movie-The idea that being free and making things better involves, at first, a dream, a fantasy, maybe even a lie.  Whatever it takes.Don't get me wrong, this is not a great movie, and feels more like an abbreviated tv miniseries in some ways.. but it has some charm. And some beautiful outdoor photography, and costumes.. all of which look really splendid in hi-def.

105359,A2F8XZO3VAIQL,0790736489,Rob,"[0, 1]",This is actually one of my favorite Kevin Costner movies.  I enjoy films that have a post apocalyptic story line and are well made. Unfortunately not all films of this genre are but THE POSTMAN is well acted and convincingly portrays a post apocalyptic America.  Scattered isolated communities across America are struggling to survive and are looking for any kind of hope to keep them going.  Kevin Costner plays the drifter who gives them hope in way of positive news he makes up on the fly in return for a hot meal and a place to sleep. Unknowing to him his improvised news inspires others in ways he hadn't expected and soon he must make hard choices.  All in all a very good film though somewhat long at three hours.,5,Great Kevin Costner film,1399852800,"05 12, 2014",2014,720,"['actually', 'one', 'favorite', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'movies', 'enjoy', 'films', 'have', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'story', 'line', 'are', 'well', 'made', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'films', 'genre', 'are', 'THE', 'POSTMAN', 'well', 'acted', 'convincingly', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'America', 'Scattered', 'isolated', 'communities', 'America', 'are', 'struggling', 'survive', 'are', 'looking', 'kind', 'hope', 'keep', 'going', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'drifter', 'who', 'hope', 'way', 'positive', 'news', 'up', 'fly', 'return', 'hot', 'meal', 'place', 'sleep', 'Unknowing', 'improvised', 'news', 'others', 'ways', 'had', ""n't"", 'expected', 'soon', 'must', 'make', 'hard', 'choices', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'somewhat', 'long', 'three', 'hours']",N/A

For one, the ambivalence of the main character portrayed by Kevin Costner, who, having fled a roving army that conscripted him against his will, picks up a sack of discarded mail, dons a uniform, and gallivants about the country portraying himself as a mailman.  After about the first hour of the movie, in which Costner is generally humiliated by his captors and inexplicably offers scant resistance, the film deteriorates into a naive, silly plotline involving Costner as a postman, bringing hope to a besieged humanity.  The problem is, the Costner cum mailman character is so ambiguous and ambivalent, that the rest of the movie comes across naive, pointless, and silly, not least because the scriptwriter hasn't clearly defined Costner's motives.  In most of the closeups, Costner has a mildly pained look in his face, but we can't tell whether he is a fierce warrior for human freedom or someone who misplaced his boxer shorts between takes and can't decide what to do now.  And this thing plods on for a full three hours, with a small army of young men and women becoming postal conscripts, so to speak, and carrying forth the flame.  This is interspersed with bloody battle scenes between the conscripts and the army that originally seized Costner, and punctuated by a romantic subplot in which a woman asks Costner to impregnate her, then inexplicably treats him like dirt when they flee together into the wilderness.  The production values are good, but you could have completely removed the storyline about the postman from the film, and you really wouldn't miss it.

105362,ADKA2MJQQCMTO,0790736489,Ron Sullivan,"[2, 6]","Before I start, I wanted to mention a moment in a film class I'd taken in college.  We were discussing today's attention span of an audience.  Basically, it was said that an audience should be able to sit through about and hour and a half to two hours worth of film without checking their watches and fidgeting.  Any more then two hours and you're going to start to lose people's attention.  I remember as clear as day what my professor had said next:... ""If your film's going to be any longer then that [2 hrs], you'd damn sure better be right about how good the piece is and your commitment to it.""So the real question here, for me, was ""was Costner right about how good `The Postman' really was?""  Well ... no ... he wasn't.  I personally feel if I sit in a theater for 3 hours, I want to either see Scotland liberated, Frodo get 1/3 of the way to Mordor, or Leonardo DiCaprio die.  That's not to say that there aren't redeeming moments in the film, but man, it really, honestly, truly, without any exaggeration COULD have been edited down to less than two hours and that feat alone would have made this a hundred times better.  There's just SO MUCH MOVIE that any momentum that it does manage to stumble onto grinds to a halt in the wake of ... well ... nothing.The acting overall, I felt was adequate.  I'll be the first to admit that I'm not really a big Costner fan.  I see a lot of his ego coming through in more then a couple of his films.  Lorenz Tate was OK in a supporting role.  The guy that I thought was terrific in this was Will Patton though.  Talk about under-rated, he is just brilliant here and (although I don't think he could ever be a good leading man) is CONSISTANTLY one of the best supporting actors in Hollywood.The writing is fair, and the plot is semi-interesting, but the film just buries itself.  I really look at this as a lesson in how not to edit a movie.

It is loosely based on the idea...and that's it.  So it's different. If you don't like it, write your own movie.  As for me, I haven't read the book yet, and I loved the movie and find the story both interesting in the idea that through one person, hope can spring and start a movement. The cinematography was very good, and unlike some other snobbish reviers think, I think seeing a mule with a sword in a Shakespeare play was just odd enough to be enjoyable.  That's coming from someone who worked for a Shakespeare Festival marketing it.  I'm tired of the purists who always want the books to match everything in the movie.  There were a few over-the-top scenes and cliche pieces, but it just didn't matter to me.  I loved seeing Tom Petty as mayor of a town and living in obscurity and being ""not famous"" any more. Sort of tongue-in-cheek humor here and there where the movie just didn't take itself seriously was actually refreshing.  No, it's not Dances with Wolves great, or Field of Dreams great...but pretty decent movie that is entertaining start to finish.  I'll go read the book when I want to get a totally different (and apparently more grim) story. I'm sure it wouldn't change my opinion that I loved the movie since I have the ability to separate the idea of reading something versus watching an adaptation of that thing that may or may not have been made with the attempt of a literal translation.  Those who rated it as ""terrible"" seem like a bunch of stuffy self-important old goats.The Blu-Ray presents a significantly clearer picture and superb sound. The difference between the DVD and Blu-Ray versions for these reasons alone make this a must-have version.UPDATE - I have now read the book...and though I do find that an interesting story in and of itself, I see no reason to bash the movie for being so different from the book. The movie had it's good points and so did the book.  Maybe a newer remake of the film can take into account the entirely different beginning...dwell on cyclops and have a less dramatic way Gordon got into Pine Ridge.  For me, the film still holds up...and now that I have read the book, I feel I have enjoyed two views of a similar story.",5,It didn't match the book...but wasn't bad either.

Of course, when I was watching ""The Postman"", I had just had oral surgery and wasn't much into moving.Nevertheless, this movie is bad. Imagine a post apocalyptic Pacific Northwest. Think of an odd marriage between an Ewok village and rejects from the cast of ""Road Warrior"", and you will get the basic feel for the setting of this movie.Kevin Costner finds a bag of undelivered mail and a postal uniform and inexplicably begins to deliver the mail. He becomes a hero to the people, now caught in a struggle between bad guys that look like they didn't make the cut for ""Road Warrior"" and are still upset, and the good American people trying to make the best of their brave new world.Radiation poisoning has sterilized men, so naturally, a local woman and her husband ask Costner to try and impregnate her. He obliges them, but the would-be stepdad is killed two scenes later signaling a romantic interest for Costner.This postal service is propped up by Costner's lie that the US Government is starting to reform and get itself together, and soon, a bunch of villagers, including the token funny black kid named Lincoln Mercury, are delivering mail.Perhaps the only amusing part of this movie is Tom Petty, playing himself, his post apocalyptic career being the head of a peace loving community. The only reason this is amusing is because I am a huge fan of Tom Petty's, and someone who isn't will not even care.Not only is the acting horrible, the plot stupid, and the characters difficult to like, but this mess drags on for a very long time. If you want a good post apocalyptic movie, get ""Road Warrior"" and ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"".

The motivation of several characters is terribly unclear, and while a narrative that presumes that everyone left in the postwar US has some real mental challenges would explain a lot of the goings-on, it just can't hold any interest.",1,Doesn't stand on its own and doesn't live up to the novel,1391990400,"02 10, 2014",2014,486,"['Ouch', 'Halfway', 'remembered', 'watching', 'cinema', 'being', 'disgusted', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'book', 'David', 'Brin', 'movie', 'take', 'pieces', 'real', 'trouble', 'overacting', 'pacing', 'overuse', 'clich', 'eacute', 'pathos', 'motivation', 'several', 'characters', 'terribly', 'unclear', 'narrative', 'everyone', 'left', 'postwar', 'US', 'real', 'mental', 'challenges', 'would', 'explain', 'lot', 'goings-on', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'hold', 'interest']",N/A

Employees of the U. S. Postal Service today work under the threat of biological, chemical, and probably explosive terrorism, but the mail is still delivered.  Communications unify.David Brin's novel &quot;The Postman&quot; was the basis for the movie.  I read the book years ago, and was very disappointed because it was hard to follow and I did not care about any character.  The movie was a pleasure.  Had this film been released in October 2001, I think it would be a box office hit.  However, the complacency in 1997, extremely poor movie trailers, and a few editing errors overshadowed the quality of the film, which I have probably seen twenty times.  One scene on the VHS version is missing from the DVD.  It is when Costner defeats Patton and the Clan throw down their weapons; DVD shows one man, VHS shows many.  I prefer the VHS scene.Kevin Costner is a wandering Shakespearean performer who acts with his mule Bill, his solo companion as he wanders alone.  He is given the name Shakespeare when captured by the militant force that dominates what few settlements have survived the apocalypse.  Will Patton's strong performance as General Bethlehem, a man who has killed so often that he has lost his sanity, is Oscar quality.Costner is the mild ordinary &quot;every man&quot; who is just trying to survive, and this is the reason that we never know his given name.  The subtle performance is superb and believable.  Costner &quot;restored&quot; the United States government, moved the capital to Minneapolis, and reinstated the postal service through blithe words that coincidentally ignited the idea that it was possible to be free from terrorism.When the Postman leaves Pineview with the first new mail in years a young girl starts singing &quot;God Bless America.&quot;  This seemed unreal to me, but since America was attacked on September 11, 2001, there has been a rise in patriotic songs that stir deep emotions.  I now think this scene is perfect.The time line, however, seems unreasonable.  Information that was revealed by the characters without showing us how they got the knowledge was edited out, and it is a flaw.Costner's character grows, as do the people who believe in him.  Ultimately, he is the man who &quot;Hands out hope like it is candy in his pocket.&quot;For character development, moving and prescient story, scenery, music, and acting this film is five stars for me.Victoria Tarrani",5,Experience the impact.,1004227200,"10 28, 2001",2001,3000,"['unfortunate', 'critics', 'many', 'reviewers', 'panned', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'powerful', 'statements', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'become', 'extraordinary', 'chance', 'commitment', 'quot', 'Postman', 'quot', 'communications', 'unite', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'then', 'able', 'defeat', 'terrorism', 'guise', 'General', 'Bethlehem.A', 'look', 'history', 'shows', 'quot', 'Pony', 'Express', 'quot', 'carriers', 'faced', 'dangers', 'such', 'wild', 'animals', 'Native', 'American', 'war', 'parties', 'outlaws', 'sea', 'voyages', 'misunderstandings', 'dehydration', 'deserts', 'famine', 'disease', 'mail', 'went', 'Employees', 'U.', 'S.', 'Postal', 'Service', 'today', 'work', 'threat', 'biological', 'chemical', 'probably', 'explosive', 'terrorism', 'mail', 'still', 'delivered', 'Communications', 'unify.David', 'Brin', 'novel', 'quot', 'Postman', 'quot', 'was', 'basis', 'movie', 'read', 'book', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'very', 'disappointed', 'was', 'hard', 'follow', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'character', 'movie', 'was', 'pleasure', 'Had', 'film', 'been', 'released', 'October', '2001', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'box', 'office', 'hit', 'However', 'complacency', '1997', 'extremely', 'poor', 'movie', 'trailers', 'few', 'editing', 'errors', 'overshadowed', 'quality', 'film', 'have', 'probably', 'seen', 'twenty', 'times', 'One', 'scene', 'VHS', 'version', 'missing', 'DVD', 'when', 'Costner', 'Patton', 'Clan', 'throw', 'down', 'weapons', 'DVD', 'one', 'man', 'VHS', 'many', 'prefer', 'VHS', 'scene.Kevin', 'Costner', 'wandering', 'Shakespearean', 'performer', 'who', 'mule', 'Bill', 'solo', 'companion', 'alone', 'given', 'name', 'Shakespeare', 'when', 'captured', 'militant', 'force', 'what', 'few', 'settlements', 'have', 'survived', 'apocalypse', 'Will', 'Patton', 'strong', 'performance', 'General', 'Bethlehem', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'so', 'often', 'lost', 'sanity', 'Oscar', 'quality.Costner', 'mild', 'ordinary', 'quot', 'man', 'quot', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'survive', 'reason', 'never', 'know', 'given', 'name', 'subtle', 'performance', 'superb', 'believable', 'Costner', 'quot', 'restored', 'quot', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'moved', 'capital', 'Minneapolis', 'reinstated', 'postal', 'service', 'blithe', 'words', 'coincidentally', 'ignited', 'idea', 'was', 'possible', 'be', 'free', 'Postman', 'Pineview', 'first', 'new', 'mail', 'years', 'young', 'girl', 'singing', 'quot', 'God', 'Bless', 'America.', 'quot', 'seemed', 'unreal', 'America', 'was', 'attacked', 'September', '11', '2001', 'been', 'rise', 'patriotic', 'songs', 'stir', 'deep', 'emotions', 'now', 'think', 'scene', 'perfect.The', 'time', 'line', 'however', 'unreasonable', 'Information', 'was', 'revealed', 'characters', 'showing', 'how', 'got', 'knowledge', 'was', 'edited', 'out', 'flaw.Costner', 'character', 'grows', 'do', 'people', 'who', 'believe', 'Ultimately', 'man', 'who', 'quot', 'out', 'hope', 'candy', 'pocket.', 'quot', 'character', 'development', 'moving', 'prescient', 'story', 'scenery', 'music', 'acting', 'film', 'five', 'stars', 'me.Victoria', 'Tarrani']",N/A

But I loved Costner's &#34;Dances with Wolves&#34; so I should have given this one a chance sooner. I was surprised with a snowday so I took the opportunity to watch this. My verdict: as Larry David would say, Pretty Good! Costner's character is an average Joe who in his misguided and self-interested ploy to get free food and shelter while on the run in a Post-apocalyptic world, ends up giving this new world hope in the simple routine of a mail system.The performances are good (especially Will Patton as the baddie) and the cinematography is lush. I don't get the really low rating that critics gave it except that it could easily be edited down to 2 and a half hours or even just 2. But these critics didn't complain so much about the long Titanic movie of that same year or the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies of subsequent years.
