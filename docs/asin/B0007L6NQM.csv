The end still leaves me speachless and unsettled, this is not a movie to watch alone. Great and sensitive direction, and the acting is superb.

881810,A1PID2MT8MMPAF,B0007L6NQM,"A. Griffiths ""Adrian""","[6, 8]","It's a real pleasure to see the full length version of Sybil finally out on DVD. The film stands up amazingly well for a drama made for TV some 30 years ago. Having just watched it again, I can honestly say this powerful story has not been diminished at all. Sally Field plays Sybil Dorsett, a troubled and secretive young woman who has a lot of trouble keeping friends, jobs and self confidence due to her constant blackouts and memory losses. When one of these episodes leads to a hand injury she comes under the scrutiny of a psychiatrist, Dr Wilbur (Joanne Woodward), who soon realises that something far more complex than a cut hand is wrong with her patient. Dr Wilbur manages to convince Sybil to return for more treatment, and the true nature of Sybil's illness starts to come to light...she has suffered such a terrible trauma at some point in her life that her only way to protect herself from insanity was to involve into what was eventually documented as 16 multiple personalities.If it wasn't for Sally Fields' stunning performance, the film would just be a curiosity piece about the sinister truth behind a schizophrenic woman's story. But thanks to her thoroughly convincing work, in a role that would surely be beyond many so-called stars of today, the film become a rivetting experience to watch. It's almost impossible to take your eyes of Sybil every time she is on screen. Sally Field manages to convey the woman within, even though she is hiding behind several distinct personalities. While its not unusual for one actor to play multiple roles within one film, it's very rare to find one who can play different characters and keep them all identifiable as facets of one, deeper personality. When Sybil comes to Dr Wilbur's office as her most confident hidden ""self"", Vicky, it's clear that we are watching a very different person from the timid Sybil. But as Dr Wilbur questions her, she's able to crack the outer personailty of ""Vicky"" slightly with probing questions, and it's fascinating to watch as Vicky breifly flickers back to being Sybil a few times before recovering herself. To do this once is clever acting, but there are many more personalities living within Sybil, and as the film progresses, Sally Field takes us on a tour of a whole range of ""selves"" that live within the character.Joanne Woodwards performance as the caring and professional Dr Wilbur is as impressive as Sally Field is as Sybil. I don't know how real psychiatric doctors handle patients with multiple personalities, but if they are anything like as supportive as Dr Wilbur, I applaud them all. I really felt as though I was watching real therapy sessions in some scenes as Woodwards sounds so authentic delivering her lines. Brad Davis (from ""Midnight Express"") makes good use of a small role as one of Sybil's neighbours who takes an interest in her, only to find, sadly, that the shocking extent of her mental illness is too much for him. Sadly the role of ""little Sybil"" (in the flashback sequences that show what went on in Sybil's childhood) is played rather awkwardly by the young Natasha Ryan, but then she is a very young child. Although some of her scenes are quite good, her plight in these scenes is made most effective by...her mother. My god, I hated that woman! As this is a true story, the horrific and upsetting truth behind Sybil's childhood abuse never fails to leave me feeling shocked and angry. The actress who plays Sybil's mother in the flashback sequences nails her as an insane bully, and her terrifying performance makes you want to reach into the screen and do something, especially in the final 15 minutes of the movie when Sybil's deepest, most hurtful memories of the abuse are revealed.I don;t know how many liberties were taken with the real story, but the events, explanations, Sybil's dreams and phobias as depicted in this film stand out as well formed and convincing enough for me to believe that most of the events in the film really did happen as documented. There aren't many things that let the film down. I would have liked Sybil's dream of the headless cat to have been better realised than it was, because it was hard to share her terror when the so-called ""chase"" in her dream was depicted by a few shots of a very obviously inanimate stuffed cat. But that's a tiny quibble in a film of this length when, for so much of the time I was totally fascinated. In fact, I would have happily watched another hour's worth of story, as even the full length version of the film cannot help but take short-cuts over some of the material. I would certainly recommend seeing it all in one sitting, although the build up is great (that horrible flashback right at the start of young Sybil on the hook), and the climax to ""part one"", where Dr Wilbur realises that Sybil's mother must have done something very seriously bad, makes for an effective pause in the film if you want to take it in as two feature length chunks rather than one marathon.""Sybil"" (the movie) is breathtakingly effective and it's depiction of abuse is still horrible even today. For a child's whole life to be shattered in such a way, and at the hands of her own mother, makes for unsettling viewing. But the over-riding story is one of treatment and recovery, and there is indeed a welcome breakthrough as the movie comes to an end. I can only hope that the real ""Sybil"" was helped and guided back to something resembling happiness in a similar way that her movie counterpart was.",5,Very good,1152835200,"07 14,

Sally Field did a brilliant job of portraying Sybil Dorsett, a young woman who developed more than a dozen personalities as a result of horrific child abuse. Joanne Woodwrd plays Dr. Cornelia Wilber, who helped her ""pull herself together,"" as Sybil put it. Brad Davis plays the kindly neighbor who eventually fled when he discovered she was rather more than he had bargained for.Early on, we discover that a significant element of the abuse she suffered as a child was related to her parents' fundamentalist religion. When she goes to her father to discuss his helping her pay for therapy, he spouts BS about psychiatrists being demonic. Of course he was heavily in denial about the abuse she had suffered.The memories of her childhood, and the scenes from one disturbing dream she keeps coming back to, are enough to give the audience a taste, but it is pretty grim. Still, her willingness to keep working with her psychiatrist and her psychiatrist's determination not to lock her away in a hospital give the audience some hope.I know there's a school of psychiatry that declares there's no such thing as multiple personalities.

So disturbing was its content, that I remember the astonishment / disgust on viewers' faces to this day. The idea of ""multiple personalities"" caused by horrific, childhood abuse / torture at the hands of one's own mother was quite unthinkable. Of course, therein lies the controversy. Was it true? Did any of it actually happen? Much like the stir caused after THE AMITYVILLE HORROR was debunked, SYBIL has come to the same questionable end (a little research on GOOGLE will help anyone to bring the whole debate into perspective). To be honest, I felt a little duped at first. I mean, I had taken the story at face value, allowing it to be etched in my head as absolute fact (yes, I realize that the film is only ""based"" on ""true"" events). Still, the TV-movie itself is a milestone in broadcast history. Many taboos were shattered, and new ground was covered (in a medium not exactly known for taking big risks). As it stands, SYBIL works well, whether as fact or fiction. The unsettling subject matter, brought to unforgettable life by Sally Field, is a powerful reminder of television's (mostly unused) potential to do far more than simply entertain or titillate. Today, after watching / reading countless news stories about child abuse, I am convinced of one thing for sure.

881822,A3JM17QHAJCOWD,B0007L6NQM,Catherine Gallanti,"[7, 7]","Sybil is a very powerful and interesting movie. It is the story of a young woman with multiple personality disorder and her psychotherapeutic journey back to wholeness with the assistance of her very nurturing psychoanalyst. The movie is 3 hours long but engaging throughout, in fact I was actually taken aback when the movie was over as it was almost midnight and I had no idea I had been watching this film for all that time. It certainly held my attention throuhgout.As a movie, it made me think again at how nice it used to be when movies were the vehicles though which to tell deep stories. Today, we have amazing technology, great visual effects, but so often the stories told are so poorly thought out and generally mediocre, that I have almost stopped renting contemporary movies all together.As far as the story told, it was interesting to see the journey of healing through the re-peicing together of old traumatic events, a painstaking  and lengthy process that , in our modern days of drug induced quick fixes and short term counseling, seems to have almost gone out of fashion. The baby was definitely tossed out with the bath water, when psychoanalytical approaches to mental health took a back seat.A great movie for anybody that is into psychology and healing.",5,Very good movie,1171324800,"02 13, 2007",2007,1276,"['Sybil', 'very', 'powerful', 'interesting', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'woman', 'multiple', 'personality', 'disorder', 'psychotherapeutic', 'journey', 'back', 'wholeness', 'assistance', 'very', 'nurturing', 'psychoanalyst', 'movie', '3', 'hours', 'long', 'engaging', 'fact', 'was', 'actually', 'taken', 'aback', 'when', 'movie', 'was', 'over', 'was', 'almost', 'midnight', 'had', 'idea', 'had', 'been', 'watching', 'film', 'time', 'certainly', 'held', 'attention', 'movie', 'made', 'think', 'again', 'how', 'nice', 'used', 'be', 'when', 'movies', 'were', 'vehicles', 'tell', 'deep', 'stories', 'Today', 'have', 'amazing', 'technology', 'great', 'visual', 'effects', 'so', 'often', 'stories', 'told', 'are', 'so', 'poorly', 'thought', 'out', 'generally', 'mediocre', 'have', 'almost', 'stopped', 'renting', 'contemporary', 'movies', 'together.As', 'far', 'story', 'told', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'journey', 'healing', 're-peicing', 'together', 'old', 'traumatic', 'events', 'painstaking', 'lengthy', 'process', 'modern', 'days', 'drug', 'induced', 'quick', 'fixes', 'short', 'term', 'counseling', 'have', 'almost', 'gone', 'fashion', 'baby', 'was', 'definitely', 'tossed', 'out', 'bath', 'water', 'when', 'psychoanalytical', 'approaches', 'mental', 'health', 'took', 'back', 'seat.A', 'great', 'movie', 'anybody', 'psychology', 'healing']",Sybil

MacNeil ""Chris M""","[2, 3]","From the light fluff of ""Gidget"" to the embarassment as ""The Flying Nun"" to a brief stint as a newly married woman with ESP in ""The Girl With Something Extra,"" it was with some trepidation that producers of this 1976 NBC-TV movie gambled on Sally Field in the title role. They won! As the emotionally ravaged and fragile school teacher afflicted with multiple personality disorder, Field unleashes a tour de force that earned her an Emmy in 1977 and set her on the path to film stardom. Based on a true life case, Sybil Dorsett had her psyche blown apart by a mother whose terrorist tactics were so sadistic that they qualified as torture, not mere abuse. By the time Sybil made it - miraculously - to adulthood, though, she had been so devastated as to manifest 16 separate personalities, each of them a ""protector"" of a specific facet of Sybil's total psyche. It's a painful watch to watch Sybil as a child endure the torture of a sadistic and brutal mother and its consequential and devastating damage Sybil carries into her adulthood. It is only with the compassion and soothing guidance of her psychiatrist, Dr. Cornelia Wilbur (Joanne Woodward) and her own strength to come to terms that Sybil manages to meld her multiple personalities into one. And making a point of bringing Sybil's various personalities together as opposed to ""exorcising"" them is a compliment to the ethical basis of director Daniel Petrie's vision. The telepic for Field is cited as her career-making performance, and justifiably so. In 1980, only three years after nailing the Emmy for her first starring dramatic role, Field took the first of her two Oscars for ""Norma Rae."" For Woodward, her role as Sybil's psychiatrist was full circle: interestling, nearly 20 years earlier, Woodward won an Oscar for her role as a woman with the same psychiatric condition in ""The three Faces of Eve."" Though 30 years old, ""Sybil"" retains a timelessness if for no other reason than multiple personality disorder remains a psychiatric phenomenon.

However, it is a movie that has a happy ending, telling the stoy of a young lady taking control of her life. The acting is superb by Field. The movie is a roller coaster of emotions that will leave you breathless and aware.I ran across this movie in an old rental store that was going out of business. I paid about $3.00 for it. I cannot watch it all the time because of the subject matter, but I do watch it every now and then. I remember seeing it on I think Lifetime one day.

881838,AZB4CQ9JZSUQB,B0007L6NQM,Eric Pregosin,"[48, 52]","If the name Sally Field appeared on a nationwide (better yet a human race wide) word association test, we would be all divided in thirds.  One third would remember sitcoms of the 60s and 70s like ""Gidget"", ""The Flying Nun"" and ""The Girl With Something Extra"".  The Second Third would remember her wonderful appearances on the big screen since 80s (maybe the 70s too) in ""Places In The Heart"", ""Norma Rae"", ""The Smokey And The Bandit Trilogy"", ""Steel Magnolias"", ""Forrest Gump"", and others.  The Final Third would be right on the border between the 2 groups.  How soon we forget her appearance in the fall of 1976 in an Emmy winning performance in the 2 part tv movie ""Sybil"".  Based on the true novel by Flora Rheta Schreiber, Field plays a young substitute teacher/art student whose battered childhood (thanks to a schizophrenic mother and a henpecked father) shattered her so that she grew to adulthood with 16 distinct personalities (all children) although for the tv film they imply 13 (based on the writing on the back of the box and the ending credits of the film).  The film also stars Joanne Woodward (aka Mrs. Paul Newman) as Cornelia B. Wilbur, the psychiatrist determined to help Sybil pull her self (or selves if you will) together (the real Dr. Wilbur served as a consultant to the film).  Other stars include bit part actors William Prince as her father Willard Dorsett (in present scenes he is remarried to a ""normal"" woman), Martine Bartlett (in flashbacks) as Hattie Dorsett, the schizoid mother, veteran bit part actor Charles Lane as Dr. Quinones, the hometown M.D. who in the present helps shed some light on her case to Dr. Wilbur, and a young unknown named Brad Davis as neighbor Richard Loomis, a young widower with a young son Matthew (both of whom become ""fond"" of Sybil before realizing her ""condition"").  The film won 4 Emmys including a tie for best Dramatic Special and as I stated above Best Actress in a Dramatic Special (for Field).  The film originally ran on NBC in 2 parts (at 2 hours with commericals) each.  Most stations nowadays if they run it, show it all at one time.  When it was released on prerecorded VHS, it was cut from the 3 hours and change (without commercials) by an hour probably because very few movies over 2 hours hit videotape (except as 2 tape sets).

881839,AG8K92N37MT27,B0007L6NQM,Garnet,"[0, 0]","This movie scared me and freaked me out when it first came out and I watched it.  It hasn't lost any of its award-winning power since...Sally Field does an absolutely spectacular job as ""Sybil,"" a shy unassuming girl who lived her life in between blanking out when other personalities apparently took over.  The movie revolves around her and her doctor discovering all of these alternative personalities--including some who are more messed up than Sybil is and some who are more dominant and even charming--and, eventually, uncover the horrific childhood reasons for why they came into being.One small issue is the way that the movie was filmed looks a tiny bit dated by now.  This is not as much of a problem as the issues that have more recently come to light regarding the veracity of the events portrayed in the movie (btw, the movie also took some creative license in comparison to the book).  Now that I watch it, I have a more difficult time getting into the movie purely on its own basis, because I now know that some of the ""truth"" in this story is pretty suspect and some is decidedly false.I also didn't know back in the days when I first saw this movie what the professional relationship should be between a psychiatrist and her patient, and apparently neither did the actual psychiatrist who saw the real patient...and this also comes across a bit in the film.  This now also bothers me a bit, especially since I know from other sources that the real relationship between the doctor and ""Sybil"" was inappropriate even back in the day.Even so, I actually prefer the movie to the book, a rare thing, because it is much more intensely focussed, which is hardly surprising since taking a book to the screen often requires cutting out extraneous details.  The movie portrays the most pivotal event in the life of ""Sybil,"" as her history plays out within the confines of the doctor office.  The interaction between the two female characters as they undergo this journey together is perfect and I can see why there was so much acclaim given to the actors.  They both did a great job with what must have been some of the most intense scenes of their lives.After all of these years, this movie is still hard to watch.  NOT a movie for kids IN THE LEAST.  Also, any adult who is bothered by scenes of child abuse and neglect should likely avoid this movie.4 stars because this movie is GOOD, but 1 star less because it might be too much for some and because of the issues with it actually being a ""true story.""For a more modern take on the idea of having alternative personalities, you might want to check out the great series, ""The United States of Tara.""",4,Terrifying Movie,1379030400,"09 13, 2013",2013,2659,"['movie', 'scared', 'freaked', 'out', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'watched', ""n't"", 'lost', 'award-winning', 'power', 'Sally', 'Field', 'absolutely', 'spectacular', 'job', 'Sybil', 'shy', 'unassuming', 'girl', 'who', 'lived', 'life', 'blanking', 'out', 'when', 'other', 'personalities', 'apparently', 'took', 'over', 'movie', 'doctor', 'discovering', 'alternative', 'personalities', 'including', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'messed', 'up', 'Sybil', 'who', 'are', 'more', 'dominant', 'even', 'charming', 'eventually', 'horrific', 'childhood', 'reasons', 'why', 'came', 'being.One', 'small', 'issue', 'way', 'movie', 'was', 'filmed', 'tiny', 'bit', 'dated', 'now', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'problem', 'issues', 'have', 'more', 'recently', 'come', 'light', 'regarding', 'veracity', 'events', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'btw', 'movie', 'also', 'took', 'creative', 'license', 'comparison', 'book', 'Now', 'watch', 'have', 'more', 'difficult', 'time', 'getting', 'movie', 'purely', 'own', 'basis', 'now', 'know', 'truth', 'story', 'pretty', 'suspect', 'decidedly', 'false.I', 'also', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'back', 'days', 'when', 'first', 'saw', 'movie', 'what', 'professional', 'relationship', 'should', 'be', 'psychiatrist', 'patient', 'apparently', 'did', 'actual', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'saw', 'real', 'patient', 'also', 'bit', 'film', 'now', 'also', 'bothers', 'bit', 'especially', 'know', 'other', 'sources', 'real', 'relationship', 'doctor', 'Sybil', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'even', 'back', 'day.Even', 'so', 'actually', 'prefer', 'movie', 'book', 'rare', 'thing', 'much', 'more', 'intensely', 'focussed', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'taking', 'book', 'screen', 'often', 'cutting', 'out', 'extraneous', 'details', 'movie', 'most', 'pivotal', 'event', 'life', 'Sybil', 'history', 'out', 'confines', 'doctor', 'office', 'interaction', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'undergo', 'journey', 'together', 'perfect', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'acclaim', 'given', 'actors', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'what', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'intense', 'scenes', 'lives.After', 'years', 'movie', 'still', 'hard', 'watch', 'NOT', 'movie', 'kids', 'IN', 'THE', 'LEAST', 'Also', 'adult', 'who', 'bothered', 'scenes', 'child', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'should', 'likely', 'avoid', 'movie.4', 'movie', 'GOOD', '1', 'star', 'less', 'might', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'issues', 'actually', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'more', 'modern', 'take', 'idea', 'having', 'alternative', 'personalities', 'might', 'want', 'check', 'out', 'great', 'series', 'United', 'States', 'Tara']",Sybil
881840,ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV,B0007L6NQM,"Gary F. Taylor ""GFT""","[3, 3]","Published in 1973, the book SYBIL arose through the combined efforts of journalist Flora Rheta Schreiber (1918-1988), psychiatrist Dr. Cornelia B. Wilbur (1908-1992), and patient Shirley Ardell Mason (1923-1998), whose name was given as Sybil Isabell Dorsett.  The book told of a young woman, Sybil, whose repeated blackouts led her into treatment with Dr. Wilbur, who ultimately diagnosed, treated, and cured Sybil of a condition popularly known as split or multiple personality.  This had arisen in Sybil, according to Dr. Wilbur, largely due to extreme physical, sexual, and psychological abuse at the hands of a schizophrenic mother.  The book was a major success.  From the moment of its publication, however, SYBIL attracted a number of criticisms from the psychiatric community.  These tended to center on Dr. Wilbur's methodology, and it is presently the opinion of the psychiatric community that Shirley Mason's case history was ""touched up"" by Wilbur and Schreiber in order create a financially lucrative bestseller.In spite of this, like THE THREE FACES OF EVE before it, SYBIL fascinated American readers and quickly went before the camera as a made-for-television drama.  Joanne Woodward, who had won an Oscar for her performance of a woman suffering from the same condition in the 1957 THE THREE FACES OF EVE, was approached to play the title role.  She declined, but she expressed a strong interest in the role of Dr. Wilbur, and was quickly signed to the project.  Contenders for the role of Sybil included Audrey Hepburn, Patti Duke, and Natalie Wood; in the end, however, it went to an actress who was almost exclusively known as the likeable star of such goody-goody-gumdrops television series as GIDGET, THE FLYING NUN, and THE GIRL WITH SOMETHING EXTRA.  Absolutely nothing in her previous work indicated that Sally Field would be capable of playing such a complex dramatic role, and her casting was controversial, but it proved a turning point in her career: after winning an Emmy for SYBIL, Field would grow into a major dramatic star, winning two Academy Awards as Best Actress.Originally aired over the course of two nights, SYBIL runs 187 minutes, or a little over three hours.  As a made-for-television movie, SYBIL lacks the budget of a major Hollywood release.  Both things work in favor of the film: the movie has time for both story and characters to develop and a simplicity of production value that focuses viewers on the performances.  The result is uniquely powerful.  As the film begins, Sybil is a substitute teacher who is working with children in New York's Central Park.  She is distracted by a squeaking swing--and after experiencing disturbing images she suddenly finds herself standing in water, her students staring at her, the supervising teacher astonished and concerned.  A slightly later episode is even more extreme: Sybil comes to herself as she breaks a window in her apartment and cuts her arm.  At the hospital she is seen by Dr. Wilbur, who is quickly aware that Sybil suffers from mental illness.  But what is this strange illness?  And how can it be treated?  The cast, which includes Brad Davis (best known for the film MIDNIGHT EXPRESS) and Martine Bartlett, is exceptional, and the ensemble plays in a low-key, extremely realistic style; there is no bravado, no ""look at me, I'm acting"" about it.  But ultimately, the success of the film rests on whether or not Sally Field is actually believable in the role of a woman whose identity has fragmented into no fewer than sixteen separate and distinguishable personalities.  Simply stated, she is.  From the moment the film begins to the its last moments, Field is entirely believable, and as a result SYBIL is every bit as fascinating, shocking, and powerful as you think it ought it be.SYBIL was previously available in a ""condensed form"" on a hard-to-find VHS.  The DVD release not only restores the previously cut material, it is virtually pristine in terms of photograph and sound.  Unfortunately, second disk bonuses seem slight; interviews with Fields, Woodward, and others are interesting, as are Mason's art work, but the rest is fairly trivial--and no, they do not include any direct recordings of Mason's therapy sessions as advertising implies.  The question of how accurate SYBIL is will likely remain with us forever.  Although both Dr. Wilbur and Shirley Ardell Mason are dead, Wilbur's files have remained sealed, and it seems unlikely that other evaluating psychiatrists will have access to them any time soon.  But fact or fiction, SYBIL is an amazing film.

I remember walking through the room and seeing parts of it on my way through.  Those short glimpses had freaked me out for years.  From what I saw then it was a horror movie.  I suppose it still is.  When I finally saw it years later, I was able to watch it for what it was: the story of a tragic childhood and how it had produced the women named Sybil, Peggy, Vicky, and thirteen others.I never could understand why this movie was never available in its full length when every part of it is important to the story.  I was able to make my own choppy copy, cutting out commercials, that I watched countless times.  To put this new full length version in my DVD player and watch it was like watching a whole different movie.  The color in itself made it stand out to make it seem like I was watching it for the first time.I'm not a critic.  I love movies.  This is a true story.  I've read the book.

It may scare you, but that's a good thing.  This stuff is real, and though multiple personalities is a rare illness, there are tons of adults around us that are shunned because they are different, when in fact they are lost and lonely because of tragic childhoods.  There are children all around us that will grow up lost and lonely and will thus be shunned also.  With mental illness on the back burner a greater understanding of it needs too brought to the foreground if we are ever to anything about it.  If we never stop to help the adults that come out of childhood, we will never stop the abuse and neglect of children.  It will continue to be a senseless cycle.",5,Waited years for this,1156896000,"08 30, 2006",2006,1819,"['first', 'saw', 'glimpses', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'TV', '76', 'was', 'just', 'kid', 'remember', 'walking', 'room', 'seeing', 'parts', 'way', 'short', 'glimpses', 'had', 'freaked', 'years', 'what', 'saw', 'then', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'suppose', 'still', 'When', 'finally', 'saw', 'years', 'later', 'was', 'able', 'watch', 'what', 'was', 'story', 'tragic', 'childhood', 'how', 'had', 'produced', 'women', 'named', 'Sybil', 'Peggy', 'Vicky', 'thirteen', 'others.I', 'never', 'could', 'understand', 'why', 'movie', 'was', 'never', 'available', 'full', 'length', 'when', 'part', 'important', 'story', 'was', 'able', 'make', 'own', 'choppy', 'copy', 'cutting', 'out', 'commercials', 'watched', 'countless', 'times', 'put', 'new', 'full', 'length', 'version', 'DVD', 'player', 'watch', 'was', 'watching', 'whole', 'different', 'movie', 'color', 'made', 'stand', 'out', 'make', 'seem', 'was', 'watching', 'first', 'time.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'critic', 'love', 'movies', 'true', 'story', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'have', 'interest', 'workings', 'mind', 'way', 'lack', 'nurturing', 'abuse', 'can', 'cripple', 'person', 'adulthood', 'movie', 'watch', 'may', 'scare', 'good', 'thing', 'stuff', 'real', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'rare', 'illness', 'are', 'tons', 'adults', 'are', 'shunned', 'are', 'different', 'when', 'fact', 'are', 'lost', 'lonely', 'tragic', 'childhoods', 'are', 'children', 'will', 'grow', 'up', 'lost', 'lonely', 'will', 'thus', 'be', 'shunned', 'also', 'mental', 'illness', 'back', 'burner', 'greater', 'understanding', 'too', 'brought', 'foreground', 'are', 'ever', 'anything', 'never', 'stop', 'help', 'adults', 'come', 'childhood', 'will', 'never', 'stop', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'children', 'will', 'continue', 'be', 'senseless', 'cycle']",Sybil

All of the graininess that was in the vhs print is gone;all of the original color and sound is crisp and clean in the restoration.Because SYBIL was made for television viewing, there are still the fade outs where the network would have allowed for commercials.This is good so that the viewer can also take a break and stretch or pee (or cry!),and then get right back into it.This film is SO absorbing that it is like reading a novel where every page turn means that you must move on to find out what happens next!The DVD extras include extensive interviews with the screenwriter,producer,stars as well as the paintings done by Sybil and all of her alternate personalities.These paintings are now on exhibition.Other than the novel SYBIL,there are two other suggested books on multiple personality disorder,""When Rabbit Howls"" (which was made into a 6 hour mini-drama entitled ""Voices Within""), and ""Lisa: Bright and Dark"".AMAZON does a phenomenal description of this product so there is no reason for me to try to improve it.No film has ever influenced me like SYBIL has......and trust me,I watch and read a lot!

It originally aired in 1976 after Jimmy Carter's election and has a staying power in the psychological community that's hard to forget.  When I was studying psychology in college, I had a professor who was so upset she couldn't get this film on DVD when we were studying personality disorders because it paints the most vivid and true-to-life picture of the disorder.Sally Field earned an Emmy for her portrayal of a 29-year-old woman so torn apart by the events of her childhood that she developed more than sixteen different personalities of different ages and genders. Some of the more common ones were: Peggy, a frightened 9-year-old who holds the key to unlock Sybil's childhood traumas; Vanessa, who at 13 holds onto Sybil's musical past; Marcia, whose constant suicidal ideation threatens Sybil's livelihood; and Vicky, whose poise and grace step in when Sybil cannot handle a difficult situation.  This movie is based on a true story and the real Sybil was revealed to be Shirley Ardell Mason, an art teacher who died in 1998.This is a film that will touch your heart and I highly recommend viewing it in this two disc special edition.  There's another chopped down and ridiculously edited version on VHS that doesn't even do the story justice.

Persons with a fragile emotional state please stay away! Most people have different moods. However, it is quite unusual when each mood, talent, and fear is a complete personality -- a distinctly named individual. Like watching a horrifying thriller, viewers remain on pins and needles anticipating a revelation of the next personality and its connection to Sybil's sordid past. Some of these characters have repeat performances so, by paying attention, they become recognizable and can be called by name based on their voice, actions, or demeanor.Something every viewer can take away is the fact that disturbing events of the past are usually suppressed or forgotten in order to feel good about oneself  in the present. For SYBIL, disinfectant, hooks, flashlights, ceiling lamps, water, dishtowels, cats, music, hands and more all become triggers for recollection of sadistic childhood abuses. The source of such tragedies is someone she was supposed to love. The distortion of emotions placed her in denial so there was a transference of seamy past events to others. Unfortunately, in later life, she had to live with all 13 of them!As a vehicle for demonstrating acting ability, SYBIL is legendary. Actors' agents may have glossy still photographs of smiles and frowns to give directors and producers an idea of their client's ability. But for Field to seamlessly traverse so many diverse characters on screen in real time is a testimony of pure talent! Joanne Woodward is given top billing for her role as a compassionate doctor donating years of her time to put Sybil back together. But make no mistake about it, Sally Field is the real star that equates one word, SYBIL, with so much intense abuse and emotional trauma.Quote: 'Curiosity didn't tear the cat's head off, Sweetie.'",5,"A movie so good, it's not for everyone (recommended)",1161388800,"10 21, 2006",2006,1904,"['Sally', 'Field', 'delivers', 'such', 'powerfully', 'convincing', 'performance', 'Sybil', 'Dorsett', 'many', 'scenes', 'are', 'disturbing', 'watch', 'Persons', 'fragile', 'emotional', 'state', 'please', 'stay', 'away', 'Most', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'moods', 'However', 'quite', 'unusual', 'when', 'mood', 'talent', 'fear', 'complete', 'personality', 'distinctly', 'named', 'individual', 'watching', 'horrifying', 'thriller', 'viewers', 'remain', 'pins', 'needles', 'anticipating', 'revelation', 'next', 'personality', 'connection', 'Sybil', 'sordid', 'past', 'characters', 'have', 'repeat', 'performances', 'so', 'paying', 'attention', 'become', 'recognizable', 'can', 'be', 'called', 'name', 'based', 'voice', 'actions', 'demeanor.Something', 'viewer', 'can', 'take', 'away', 'fact', 'disturbing', 'events', 'past', 'are', 'usually', 'suppressed', 'forgotten', 'order', 'feel', 'good', 'present', 'SYBIL', 'disinfectant', 'hooks', 'flashlights', 'ceiling', 'lamps', 'water', 'dishtowels', 'cats', 'music', 'hands', 'more', 'become', 'triggers', 'recollection', 'sadistic', 'childhood', 'abuses', 'source', 'such', 'tragedies', 'someone', 'was', 'supposed', 'love', 'distortion', 'emotions', 'placed', 'denial', 'so', 'there', 'was', 'transference', 'seamy', 'past', 'events', 'others', 'Unfortunately', 'later', 'life', 'had', 'live', '13', 'vehicle', 'demonstrating', 'acting', 'ability', 'SYBIL', 'legendary', 'Actors', 'agents', 'may', 'have', 'glossy', 'still', 'photographs', 'smiles', 'frowns', 'give', 'directors', 'producers', 'idea', 'client', 'ability', 'Field', 'seamlessly', 'traverse', 'so', 'many', 'diverse', 'characters', 'screen', 'real', 'time', 'testimony', 'pure', 'talent', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'given', 'top', 'billing', 'role', 'compassionate', 'doctor', 'donating', 'years', 'time', 'put', 'Sybil', 'back', 'together', 'make', 'mistake', 'Sally', 'Field', 'real', 'star', 'one', 'word', 'SYBIL', 'so', 'much', 'intense', 'abuse', 'emotional', 'trauma.Quote', ""'Curiosity"", 'did', ""n't"", 'tear', 'cat', 'head', 'Sweetie']",Sybil

Set in a now distant New York, the mini-series settled down upon an introverted young woman by the name of Sybil Dorsett. Living in constant fear of social situations, she struggles to understand what is happening within herself. But when things steadily worsen, she must seek the help of a psychiatrist: Dr. Wilbur.The two women soon become one in each other; Sybil depends on Wilbur to help get her out of this mental mess while Wilbur depends on Sybil for the knowledge of the unknown world of multiple personalities. However, as the answers to Sybil's illness creep closer, they both suffer emotional breakdowns, whilst Sybil begins to understand the Knifes, the Glass, and the Green Kitchen.A horrific yet beautiful series, Sybil stands alone as one of the best made for television movies of all time.And now, it is finally being released, uncut, on this special DVD.Originally released in a condensed volume on VHS, fans of the film have been dying to get their hands on a more complete edition for years. But the long wait was all worth it.This DVD includes the following special features: a look at the real Sybil's drawings, an actual therapy session between the real Sybil and Psychiatrist, a featurette with cast interviews and more, along with the original 3 hour long broadcast version.

It's easy to have her appear as a little girl, but she did a good job with her expressions. She freaked me out sometimes. I have to say the scene where Sybil as a little girl and young dancing Danny is so cute. A lot of the scenes were indeed long and dramatic. I was thinking, ""Wow, she must have had a lot of energy"". It made me tired just to watch Sybil during her episodes. Also, it made me wonder how someone with a multiple personality disorder functions in society. Sybil loses her job and boyfriend. I wondered how far Richard would last. He was so funny and kind, but he really had no idea what he was in for. Sybil tries to find the meaning of love. Her mom was so skitzo and psychotic that she mistreated poor Sybil to the point of being unable to feel love. She was so scared and trapped with all the pain from the physical abuse. When I saw her mother stick out her foot on the steps I was puzzled with horror. I was just shocked. I have yet to see The Three Faces of Eve.

Some people in our class had to leave the room when the teacher warned about some of the things Sybil's sick mother was going to do to her in the kitchen. I searched everywhere to buy my own copy but only found a poor quality VHS copy on eBay. Also read the book by Flora Rheta Schrieber (which has eerie drawings by Sybil, including a christmas card for Dr Wilbur where the tree ornament is cracked in half).Sally Field is extraordinary. Wow. I almost start crying when she sings the ""Easter Bonnet"" song at Dr Wilbur's apartment, and she's in tears because she wants to sing it just right.So much stuff in this movie creeps me out - the buttonhook, the whole kitchen scene, her mother tripping her down the stairs and cruelly saying, ""Have a nice trip, see you next fall!"", the dream with all those evil cats (she awakens climbing the bookcase), the purple crayon in the trunk, banging windows so hard that she breaks them, and when she would look in a mirror but see one of her young personalities staring back.Some of the music is quite haunting...the high voices of children singing is what I remember the most.Even after watching this, I can hardly imagine a tenth of all the trauma Sybil had to endure at the sadistic hands of her schizophrenic mother. Her mother needed to be committed and the father should have stepped up and noticed some things. It would have been better if the dr across the street had adopted her. And it's a miracle that she didn't kill herself - Dr. Wilbur really helped her a lot, but I don't think Joanne Woodward (Dr. Wilbur) should have been nominated for an Emmy.Classic.

Neither of these two characters ages a bit and all the cars, hairstyles, fashions, etc. are right out of 1976. Furthermore, although Sybil is said to be 30 years old (putting her birthdate somewhere in the late Thirties-early Forties), the childhood flashbacks all appear to be set in the 1920's or earlier. At one point, the young Sybil recoils in horror when her father uses a button hook on her shoes--a device for a shoe style that was an antique even by the early Thirties.That said, terrific performances in a fascinating--if, knowing what we do today--highly suspect story. (Recent revelations suggest that Wilbur probably encouraged Sybil to fantasize many of her personalities and that the book's author embellished the more sensational aspects of Sybil's tale to maximize sales. Everyone--author, doctor, even Sybil--stood to earn more money if the book was a bestseller.)A ""making-of"" featurette, including comments by Joanne Woodward and the director, often raises more questions than it answers. (We're told that both Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn were briefly connected with the project but playing whom? Sybil or the doctor?). Plus, Cornelia Wilbur's name is repeatedly misspelled in subtitles and there's absolutely no mention of latter-day concerns about the veracity of this story.

During the movie, Sybil goes from one personality to another, while us viewers are also intrigued by the story. We learn of her troubled past, living with a mother who tormented her physically in a religious manner (if you think Mrs. White was such a bitch in the movie Carrie, Mrs. Dorsett, Sybil's mother, is far worse). Brad Davis also gives a nice performance as the neighbor whom Sybil sees occasionally. This movie is very odd, and is not a comedy at all. When watching this movie, you can't help but feel a great deal of sympathy for Sybil because of her negative past. The abuse scenes that involve her mother are so sad, and they make you wonder why she would be so cruel. The special features are excellent to see.

Hard to imagine considering her performance is one of the most magnificent ever put on film. She was clearly completely consumed by this character. She plays this real life schizophrenic girl so believably that its pretty much beyond jaw dropping. Sally Field gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen by any actor, be it in a TV or big screen drama. She was just amazing in this role. Joan Woodward easily rises to occasion as Sybil's Psychiatrist, and she does an admirable job. But its Field who truly astonishes with the performance of a lifetime. If you want to see some seriously great acting you really need to see her play this character. I cant say enough good things about her performace. Beyond this point I have clearly beat into the ground, the film delivers a stark and realistic image of a tormented human being with multiple personalities.

Even given the subsequent horrors some parents have perpetrated on their children (Darlie Routier, Susan Smith, Andrea Yates, etc) this story is on a level all its own.I have no idea, despite seeing the moive more than once and reading the book, what prompted Sybil's mother to torture her daughter the way she did, nor do I have any comprehension HOW Sybil survived as well as she has. Not too many of us could have adjusted and gone on with our lives under similar circumstances; this was a house of Hades for sure. The splitting of her own persona into sixteen different personalities as a survival mechanism is not only fascinating, but touching as well. The worst aspect of all this, to me, was the total indifference and denial the father/husband was guilty of, and the incompetence and reluctance of Sybil's own doctor to do anything to help her. Her mother was a very sick, deeply disturbed woman, but her father and her doctor knew of the atrocities and abuse and stood by and did nothing.Fields's acting skills were never questioned after this performance, my God she was extraordinary, a performance of a lifetime.She was brilliant, but imagine how deeply this role must have affected her.

Although made in 1976 the film holds up remarkably well due to the excellent script and acting by its leads. This movie is still used today in psychology classes in colleges throughout the country because of its excellent portrayal of multiple personality disorder and the problems of the human mind.Field broke away from her TV good-girl image with this film and stars as the real-life Sybil who suffered from sixteen different personalities when she became an adult. The movie delves into the reason Sybil suffered as she did; she had a very abusive mother who suffered from a severe case of schizophrenia and edured Sybil with constant emotional and physical abuse when she was a little girl. The film dramatizes how a doctor, played superbly by Woodward, tries to help Sybil cope with her mental disorder. Never before or since has a TV movie been so honest and blunt with social issues such as child abuse and mental disorders. The fact that this film was actually shown on network television in 1976 is amazing in itself as the film is one of the most graphic and horrifying in dealing with the hell that a young child went through.""Sybil"" was released many years ago on VHS in an edited version, but this ""30th Anniversary DVD Edition"" is outstanding as it comes in a two disc set. Disc one features the film in its entirty, uncut, and cleaned from the original studio print and it looks impeccable. Disc two has a ton of bonuses featuring informative interviews with Field, Woodward, and Stewart Stern who wrote the script based on the book by Flora Rheta Schreiber. An intersting tidbit to ""Sybil""; the network, NBC, wanted a known star to portray the lead character. NBC wanted Natalie Wood, but the writer and producer of the piece wanted an unknown actress to star in the piece.Sally Field would win her first Emmy award for ""Sybil"" and the movie would propel her to superstar status as being one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Joanne Woodward won an Oscar as Best Actress back in the 1950's in ""The Three Faces of Eve', playing a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder. Brad Davis, of ""Midnight Express"" fame, played Sybil's boyfriend.On a final note Martine Bartlett, who played Sybil's evil mother Haitti Dorsett, gives one of the most chilling and horrifying portrayals of a demented mother ever put on screen. Her performance will haunt you for days upon viewing ""Sybil"".In 2007 a remake of ""Sybil"" aired on CBS starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange and it too is an amazing film.

881894,A31BBNT8C62MLU,B0007L6NQM,Trancelucence (Leigh),"[2, 2]","Besides the ASTONISHING performances and compelling story, this film stands for me as profound or important in several other ways.  For one, it's a stellar adaptation of a great book.  Although the screenwriters invented entirely new scenes, e.g., adding a romantic interest, the street performance scenes, etc., and set the story in modern-day New York, they perfectly embodied the book's vision and purpose, subsuming several threads/themes into pithy, powerful scenes, actually improving on the book, wonderful.Though the story of Sybil is a controversial one (the real Sybil had mixed feelings about her treatment and ""cure"", as did the real ""Eve"" ofThe Three Faces Of Eve), this film succeeds on multiple levels, not only as powerful film-making but as a psychological narrative, one of the most important ever made.  As a clinician and educator, for me it resounds with many important issues.  For one thing it demonstrates the field of psychiatry as it USED to be, that is, attentive to patients' personal realities, rather than merely prescribing them meds and then showing them the door.  Dr. Wilbur takes the time to unravel the mystery of Sybil, she's committed to her patient and to the resolution of her problems.  Towards that end she employs diverse methods, combining psychoactive drugs with hypnosis, dream analysis, intensive psychotherapy, generosity, and LOVE (as did Milton Erickson, for example, as many psycho/hypnotherapists out there may know.  Sadly, practitioners of this ilk are rare, practically nonexistent today).Most of all, few films or books better express, offer more powerful metaphors for the effects of trauma and its resolution (two other movies that do also areOrdinary PeopleandLars and the Real Girl, both wonderful in general). Human beings are symbolizing creatures, extraordinarily creative in transposing their pain into baffling symbols, internal and external, thru largely unconscious, protective mechanisms, in an attempt to disguise or bury traumatic memories and their attendant pain (as just one potent example, look at what we do with FOOD, symbolically, resulting in a whole host of eating disorders).In Sybil's case, purple crayons, panes of glass, the color white, classical music, and a baffling array of other things came to represent her crippling woe, ripe for decoding and rendering inert, harmless.  And BTW, for those who claim either that Sybil was faking multiple personalities, or that Dr. Wilbur was mistaken in her diagnosis, it scarcely matters.  The task is still the same, to decipher the meanings and function of Sybil's delusions and behavior, get to their source, exorcise the pain of the original trauma, and replace old strategies and behaviors with new, adaptive ones.This film teases it all apart, and the ending is iconic, the BEST depiction ever of a person ultimately assuming responsibility for themselves, for their own psychological health, leaving the therapist behind (with her blessing).  The final scene is profound, powerful, and very moving.  MUST viewing for anyone who seeks to understand the psyche and the inner and outer dynamics related to psychological processes and healing, and a GREAT, fascinating movie to boot.",5,"Compelling Mystery, Intriguing, MUST SEE",1385769600,"11 30, 2013",2013,3212,"['ASTONISHING', 'performances', 'compelling', 'story', 'film', 'profound', 'important', 'several', 'other', 'ways', 'one', 'stellar', 'adaptation', 'great', 'book', 'screenwriters', 'invented', 'entirely', 'new', 'scenes', 'e.g.', 'adding', 'romantic', 'interest', 'street', 'performance', 'scenes', 'etc.', 'set', 'story', 'modern-day', 'New', 'York', 'perfectly', 'embodied', 'book', 'vision', 'purpose', 'subsuming', 'several', 'threads/themes', 'pithy', 'powerful', 'scenes', 'actually', 'improving', 'book', 'story', 'Sybil', 'controversial', 'one', 'real', 'Sybil', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'treatment', 'cure', 'did', 'real', 'Eve', 'ofThe', 'Three', 'Faces', 'Eve', 'film', 'multiple', 'levels', 'not', 'only', 'powerful', 'film-making', 'psychological', 'narrative', 'one', 'most', 'important', 'ever', 'made', 'clinician', 'educator', 'many', 'important', 'issues', 'one', 'thing', 'field', 'psychiatry', 'USED', 'be', 'attentive', 'patients', 'personal', 'realities', 'rather', 'merely', 'prescribing', 'meds', 'then', 'showing', 'door', 'Dr.', 'Wilbur', 'time', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'Sybil', 'committed', 'patient', 'resolution', 'problems', 'Towards', 'end', 'diverse', 'methods', 'combining', 'psychoactive', 'drugs', 'hypnosis', 'dream', 'analysis', 'intensive', 'psychotherapy', 'generosity', 'LOVE', 'did', 'Milton', 'Erickson', 'example', 'many', 'psycho/hypnotherapists', 'there', 'may', 'know', 'Sadly', 'practitioners', 'ilk', 'are', 'rare', 'practically', 'nonexistent', 'today', '.Most', 'few', 'films', 'books', 'better', 'express', 'offer', 'more', 'powerful', 'metaphors', 'effects', 'trauma', 'resolution', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'do', 'also', 'areOrdinary', 'PeopleandLars', 'Real', 'Girl', 'wonderful', 'general', 'Human', 'beings', 'are', 'symbolizing', 'creatures', 'extraordinarily', 'creative', 'transposing', 'pain', 'baffling', 'symbols', 'internal', 'external', 'largely', 'unconscious', 'protective', 'mechanisms', 'attempt', 'disguise', 'bury', 'traumatic', 'memories', 'attendant', 'pain', 'just', 'one', 'potent', 'example', 'look', 'what', 'do', 'FOOD', 'symbolically', 'resulting', 'whole', 'host', 'eating', 'disorders', '.In', 'Sybil', 'case', 'purple', 'crayons', 'panes', 'glass', 'color', 'white', 'classical', 'music', 'baffling', 'array', 'other', 'things', 'came', 'represent', 'crippling', 'woe', 'ripe', 'decoding', 'rendering', 'inert', 'harmless', 'BTW', 'who', 'claim', 'Sybil', 'was', 'faking', 'multiple', 'personalities', 'Dr.', 'Wilbur', 'was', 'mistaken', 'diagnosis', 'scarcely', 'matters', 'task', 'still', 'same', 'decipher', 'meanings', 'function', 'Sybil', 'delusions', 'behavior', 'get', 'source', 'exorcise', 'pain', 'original', 'trauma', 'replace', 'old', 'strategies', 'behaviors', 'new', 'adaptive', 'ones.This', 'film', 'apart', 'ending', 'iconic', 'BEST', 'depiction', 'ever', 'person', 'ultimately', 'assuming', 'responsibility', 'own', 'psychological', 'health', 'leaving', 'therapist', 'blessing', 'final', 'scene', 'profound', 'powerful', 'very', 'moving', 'MUST', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'who', 'understand', 'psyche', 'inner', 'outer', 'dynamics', 'related', 'psychological', 'processes', 'healing', 'GREAT', 'fascinating', 'movie', 'boot']",Sybil

I saw this as a young child and it made such an impression (the cat...!). Now, as an adult I am able to appreciate it. Sally Field, as others have said really is the gold standard when it comes to actresses, sadly she doesn't seem to get the credit she richly deserves. The mother was such a viscious monster (FIVE star performance) it is sometimes difficult to watch what is done to young Sybil but in the end strength prevails. I would give this 5 stars but parts of the Joanne Woodward performances just never rang true to me. Though it is worth the mention, the soundtrack is AMAZING!--Update here, upon actual purchase.This movie in many ways is hard to watch. It's exhausting. I often well up when I see Sybil going through so much torment. As a viewer I feel such pity. Much pity. That's why Joanne just doesn't seem to grasp this part for me. She is just too clinical, almost inhuman. I realize ""in part"" she must be this way because of ""professionalism""... but c'mon, this is a fellow HUMAN BEING being put through a living hell, some tears now and then would be nice. Even if she would have to leave the room and come to grips with what she had witnessed. ""Ok Sybil, you are bound, gagged, and mutilated sexually... where are you?"" Sheesh.... I couldn't just sit there! Ack!I can't say I was wowed by the extras. It is nice to see Sally Field take part in them but it seems the writer who transcribed the book to a script gets top billing. He seems to go on adnausium. Joanne also takes part as does the wife of the second director. As a whole it is nice to see them but just about the only thing I took away and took to heart is the fact that the ""boyfriend"" within the movie was not part of the book. Which brings to light just about the only thing in the movie I have never liked. It's very awkward having the love interest have a child and it seems now it's more for shock value when the child exclaims ""That's not Sybil, she stayed home!""I can say the extras hammered home how hard Sally worked on this picture but then again I could have guessed that much, the product is proof. Sadly, I did not hear one word about the soundtrack which is haunting and in many ways ""crafts"" what is seen on screen, much like in the Amityville Horror and any great soundtrack.Lastly, I was a bit aghast to learn how against Sally the writer seemed to be (at the beginning). Surely those in the know, know enough to not type cast or pigeon-hole any capable actor. Could they not figure out that Sally Field could play more than the Flying Nun?
