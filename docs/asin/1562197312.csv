Baki the grappler and Ayane do resemble each other but there are some differences that give Ayane a much more interesting story. For one Ayane starts out with no fighting skills but her semi athletic body assures her potential to be a professional wrestler. A lot of people want to throw a wrench into Ayane's plans to dominate wrestling except for her friend and trainer. Ayane's high kick is full of tough girls that will fight to their very last breath to win. There's tons of cool action and an even better story but who knows what's next for her.,5,Never Met A Girl Like This,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,649,"['animation', 'can', 'look', 'bit', 'aged', 'times', 'never', 'enjoying', 'series', 'grappler', 'Ayane', 'do', 'resemble', 'other', 'are', 'differences', 'give', 'Ayane', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'one', 'Ayane', 'out', 'fighting', 'skills', 'semi', 'athletic', 'body', 'potential', 'be', 'professional', 'wrestler', 'lot', 'people', 'want', 'throw', 'wrench', 'Ayane', 'plans', 'dominate', 'wrestling', 'friend', 'trainer', 'Ayane', 'high', 'kick', 'full', 'tough', 'girls', 'will', 'fight', 'very', 'last', 'breath', 'win', 'tons', 'cool', 'action', 'even', 'better', 'story', 'who', 'what', 'next']",N/A

Really good story of a girl trying to become a female wrestler and tricked into being a kick boxer, who must hide it from school, family, and so on.  Complete with blackmailing little brother who finds out. The only reason I don't rate it higher is that it is only two episodes.",4,very good but short,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,389,"['very', 'good', 'clean', 'set', 'foul', 'language', 'nudity', 'other', 'junk', 'so', 'prevelent', 'anime', 'days', 'Really', 'good', 'story', 'girl', 'trying', 'become', 'female', 'wrestler', 'tricked', 'being', 'kick', 'boxer', 'who', 'must', 'hide', 'school', 'family', 'so', 'Complete', 'blackmailing', 'little', 'brother', 'who', 'out', 'only', 'reason', 'do', ""n't"", 'rate', 'higher', 'only', 'two', 'episodes']",N/A
183451,A18UDHMBY4BAKU,1562197312,Mr. Batt-Man,"[1, 2]","""From The Screenwriter Of Cutey Honey!""  That's what the headlines on the back of the DVD scream.  I'll confess now, upon reading that, I had foreboding thoughts of naked girls with their naughty bits barely covered up.Boy was I wrong.There's no naughtily at all.  Ayane's High Kick is the story of Ayane Mitsui and her dream to become a Professional Wrestler.  Unfortunately, she sucks.  However, she dose have one strong point.  Her legs.  With these legs, she can deliver what's dubbed ""The Golden High Kick,"" a blow that can cause a KO instantly, which would without a doubt, make her an excellent Kick Boxer.  Just one tiny problem.  Ayane HATES kick boxing.  So, her manager tricks her into thinking he's training her to be a Pro Wrestler, all the while, training her to be the best Kick Boxer in all Japan, and defeat the nasty Sakurako Miyagawa and her gravity defying Pony Tail.Like I said in the beginning, Ayane's High Kick is not what I expected, in fact, the ending caught me by surprise, and you can't help but wonder weather or not the producers had plans for a sequel.  The animation is superb, and the voice acting to mediocre.  I say this because the actors do their best to lip sync to the obviously over done mouth movements of the animation.  The end result is that some words come out over done, and strung out a bit too long.  The characters themselves are fine, and are the typical Japanese animie characters.  My only problem with the characters are the vice principle, who seems way to obsessed with trying to get Ayane expelled, and Sakurako's motives for hating Ayane.  They just seemed too forced in my opinion.Over all, Ayane's High Kick is a fine investment, and a good watch.",4,Not at all what I expected,1201392000,"01 27, 2008",2008,1707,"['Screenwriter', 'Cutey', 'Honey', 'what', 'headlines', 'back', 'DVD', 'scream', ""'ll"", 'confess', 'now', 'reading', 'had', 'foreboding', 'thoughts', 'naked', 'girls', 'naughty', 'bits', 'barely', 'covered', 'up.Boy', 'was', 'wrong.There', 'naughtily', 'Ayane', 'High', 'Kick', 'story', 'Ayane', 'Mitsui', 'dream', 'become', 'Professional', 'Wrestler', 'Unfortunately', 'However', 'dose', 'have', 'one', 'strong', 'point', 'legs', 'legs', 'can', 'deliver', 'what', 'dubbed', 'Golden', 'High', 'Kick', 'blow', 'can', 'cause', 'KO', 'instantly', 'would', 'doubt', 'make', 'excellent', 'Kick', 'Boxer', 'Just', 'one', 'tiny', 'problem', 'Ayane', 'HATES', 'kick', 'boxing', 'So', 'manager', 'thinking', 'training', 'be', 'Pro', 'Wrestler', 'while', 'training', 'be', 'best', 'Kick', 'Boxer', 'Japan', 'defeat', 'nasty', 'Sakurako', 'Miyagawa', 'gravity', 'defying', 'Pony', 'Tail.Like', 'said', 'beginning', 'Ayane', 'High', 'Kick', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'fact', 'ending', 'caught', 'surprise', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'weather', 'not', 'producers', 'had', 'plans', 'sequel', 'animation', 'superb', 'voice', 'acting', 'mediocre', 'say', 'actors', 'do', 'best', 'lip', 'sync', 'obviously', 'done', 'mouth', 'movements', 'animation', 'end', 'result', 'words', 'come', 'out', 'done', 'out', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'characters', 'are', 'fine', 'are', 'typical', 'Japanese', 'animie', 'characters', 'only', 'problem', 'characters', 'are', 'vice', 'principle', 'who', 'way', 'obsessed', 'trying', 'get', 'Ayane', 'expelled', 'Sakurako', 'motives', 'hating', 'Ayane', 'just', 'seemed', 'too', 'forced', 'opinion.Over', 'Ayane', 'High', 'Kick', 'fine', 'investment', 'good', 'watch']",N/A
183452,A2O6KLIFWEKL51,1562197312,P. Krug,"[0, 1]","Ayane Mitsui is a high school girl with dreams of one day becoming a pro wrestler. However, she fails to make the wrestling try-outs. Disapointed, she heads home, but runs into Kunimitsu, a man who says he recognizes she has talent and wants to train her. Ayane accepts, not knowing that he plans to train her as a kickboxer, not a wrestler. Naturally, she's quite upset when the day of her first match is to be a kickboxing one, since she has no interest in anything but wrestling. Regardless, she goes ahead and fights her opponent, and after a hard battle, wins. Ayane then plans to quit kickboxing, but things don't work out so well.Sayoko, an arrogant rich girl and undeafeated kickboxing champ, is upset when the newspapers decline to comment on her latest victory and instead focus on Ayane's debut match. Now Sayoko begins taunting Ayane, wanting to meet her in the ring. What's more, The vice principal of Ayane's school has found out about the match, and it turns out students are strictly prohibited from participating in outside sports, and now the vice principal wants her expelled. However, the head principal saw and loved Ayane's match, despite it's violation of school rules, and he warns that, given the recent publicity the school has recieved as a result of her match, expelling her could give the school great public shame. What it comes down to is this: If Ayane fights and defeats Sayoko, she'll be allowed to stay in school. If she loses, the principal says,""We'll discuss the options, including expulsion."" (Yes, I know, it's hard for me to belive, too, but just try to suspend your disbelief.)(WARNING! MAJOR PLOT SPOILER AHEAD!!!)Many people have complained before about the ending, saying that it leaves you hanging. While it does leave you wanting to see Ayane have a second match against Sayoko so she can really kick the rich chick's butt instead of just winning by desicion (especially with the way Sayoko tells Ayane she didn't really win, and Ayane's own dissatisfaction afterwards,) this ending doesn't feel nearly as incomplete as some other animes I've seen (LEGEND OF THE LAST LABRYNTH, NINJA CADETS and JEWEL BEM HUNTER LIME immediately come to mind.) Even if Ayane never gets to fight Sayoko again, we know for certain she'll at least be allowed to finish school, so the ending's really not that bad.",5,Wonderful-if short-anime martial arts/sports comedy.,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,2340,"['Ayane', 'Mitsui', 'high', 'school', 'girl', 'dreams', 'one', 'day', 'becoming', 'pro', 'wrestler', 'However', 'make', 'wrestling', 'try-outs', 'Disapointed', 'home', 'Kunimitsu', 'man', 'who', 'talent', 'train', 'Ayane', 'accepts', 'not', 'knowing', 'train', 'kickboxer', 'not', 'wrestler', 'Naturally', 'quite', 'upset', 'when', 'day', 'first', 'match', 'be', 'kickboxing', 'one', 'interest', 'anything', 'wrestling', 'Regardless', 'ahead', 'fights', 'opponent', 'hard', 'battle', 'wins', 'Ayane', 'then', 'quit', 'kickboxing', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'so', 'well.Sayoko', 'arrogant', 'rich', 'girl', 'undeafeated', 'kickboxing', 'champ', 'upset', 'when', 'newspapers', 'decline', 'comment', 'latest', 'victory', 'instead', 'focus', 'Ayane', 'debut', 'match', 'Now', 'Sayoko', 'taunting', 'Ayane', 'wanting', 'meet', 'ring', 'What', 'more', 'vice', 'principal', 'Ayane', 'school', 'found', 'out', 'match', 'out', 'students', 'are', 'strictly', 'prohibited', 'participating', 'outside', 'sports', 'now', 'vice', 'principal', 'expelled', 'However', 'head', 'principal', 'saw', 'loved', 'Ayane', 'match', 'violation', 'school', 'rules', 'given', 'recent', 'publicity', 'school', 'recieved', 'result', 'match', 'expelling', 'could', 'give', 'school', 'great', 'public', 'shame', 'What', 'down', 'Ayane', 'fights', 'defeats', 'Sayoko', ""'ll"", 'be', 'allowed', 'stay', 'school', 'principal', ""'ll"", 'discuss', 'options', 'including', 'expulsion', 'Yes', 'know', 'hard', 'belive', 'too', 'just', 'try', 'suspend', 'disbelief.', 'WARNING', 'MAJOR', 'PLOT', 'SPOILER', 'AHEAD', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'ending', 'saying', 'hanging', 'leave', 'wanting', 'see', 'Ayane', 'have', 'second', 'match', 'Sayoko', 'can', 'really', 'kick', 'rich', 'chick', 'butt', 'instead', 'just', 'winning', 'desicion', 'especially', 'way', 'Sayoko', 'Ayane', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'win', 'Ayane', 'own', 'dissatisfaction', 'afterwards', 'ending', ""n't"", 'feel', 'nearly', 'as', 'incomplete', 'other', 'animes', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'LEGEND', 'THE', 'LAST', 'LABRYNTH', 'NINJA', 'CADETS', 'JEWEL', 'BEM', 'HUNTER', 'LIME', 'immediately', 'come', 'mind', 'Even', 'Ayane', 'never', 'fight', 'Sayoko', 'again', 'know', 'certain', ""'ll"", 'least', 'be', 'allowed', 'finish', 'school', 'ending', 'really', 'not', 'bad']",N/A
