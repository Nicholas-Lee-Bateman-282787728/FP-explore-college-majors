When HBO broadcast it back in '82, I was a senior in high school and only the very wealthy owned VCRs.  A friend of my mother's had one, and recorded it for me.  I've kept that old tape and cherished it ever since - but have hoped someday someone would release it on DVD.  Now here it is.This is probably the best production of Camelot I've ever seen, from then to now, with a crack cast, superior production, tremendous arrangements (do yourself a favor, and choose this version over the far inferior movie!).  Harris was always a fine, fine Arthur, and here on stage he shines.  Richard Muenz's Lancelot is probably the best ever, and Meg Bussert's Guenevere is lighthearted and airy with a stunning voice.I'm so glad this is finally on DVD.

1060273,A25UZ7MA72SMKM,B000NTM9ZM,Brent Butler,"[0, 0]","I remembered this presentation of Camelot from originally watching it on HBO 30 years ago. I find that I appreciate it now more than I did then. The cast gives a spirited presentation, and in certain cases the singing is improved over the highly regarded movie version.But first, let's cover the qualities of the DVD. Seeing as it was mastered from tape with some age on it, it looks surprisingly good. Many scenes are extremely sharp, while a few do have some grain. However, don't be fooled by the opening credits. They look terrible. Once the play starts the visuals improve significantly. The colors are rich, and although the set is usually somewhat dimly lit during this production, the colors come through as strong and varied. We watched this on a 55"" wide-screen, so any flaws in the video presentation should have been magnified, unless by some chance our Blu ray player or receiver are doing outstanding jobs at up-scaling.Some reviewers complained of problems with the sound, but we did not experience that. All the dialogue was clear to me, and the music sounded uniformly sharp. There were a couple of issues with high notes in Guinevere songs, but I don't know if that was the voice of the actress or some distortion. I couldn't really tell, and these occurrences were infrequent and brief. They did not annoy.The production obviously embraced the performances of the film, as the director did not decide to go off on some tangent to stamp his own interpretation onto the material. In some of Richard Harris's songs, you might have almost thought he was dubbed by the movie's soundtrack. The timing of the delivery and the notes were not exact, but they were VERY close.Richard Harris did seem a bit subdued compared to the film, almost as if because of the film, he already knew that this story ends in tragedy. While certain parts of his performance were not as crisp as the film, he didn't get multiple takes on the stage, so that is understandable. His depiction of Arthur's pain was deeper than the film, maybe because an older Harris knew more of pain by the day of this stage production. Let's say that in this play, he made his grief real.Meg Bussert as Guinevere is a better singer than Vanessa Redgrave, but doesn't give the same delicious acting performance. However, she fills the role adequately, and does sell it.Richard Muenz doesn't seem to get as much stage time as Lancelot did in the film, and I felt I barely knew him before the romance between Lance and Jenny blossomed. He did a great job on C'est Moi ... possibly my personal favorite song from Camelot ... and injected just the right amount of humor into it, an element not present in the sumptuous juxtaposition of song and travel depicted in the film. Unfortunately, his rendition of ""If Ever I Could Leave You"" comes in a VERY distant 3rd to Robert Goulet in the original and Gene Merlino's dub of Franco Nero in the film. It really is a very pedestrian performance of a signature song. Muenz's voice just wasn't full and rich enough to carry off this song. I think he knew that, and in trying to make up for it wasn't completely on key throughout the song either.Barrie Ingram was creditable as Pelenor, but doesn't compare to the great Lionel Jeffries.James Valentine is wonderful as Merlin.Richard Backus as Mordred delivers a competent performance, but is in no way the sinister presence David Hemmings brought to the film, or what through the soundtrack I can imagine from Roddy McDowell in the original play. In this production ""The Seven Deadly Virtues"" is just a song that quickly comes and goes, not a defining statement of character and a menacing warning of things to come. To me, Backus looked like what would happen if you tried to place Shaun Cassidy in an evil role.I never had an opportunity to see the first run of the play with its impressive cast, though I own and enjoy that soundtrack. We only have two visual presentations of this material: The film Camelot and this stage production. I prefer the film, but this makes for an entertaining change of pace from watching the film yet again. There were some alternate decisions about which songs to include here, so you will get to hear a few that weren't included in the film. Unfortunately, to make time for those songs, they dropped ""Take Me To the Fair"", which I thought to be a necessary build up to the tournament.Speaking of the tournament, there is a song from the chorus that decribes the action from the tournament to the audience. It reminded me amusingly of the Ascot race from ""My Fair Lady"".To sum up, this is an imperfect but enjoyable production of a signature musical, and one of the last great musicals (1967 version) to be filmed.Recommended.",4,Entertaining variant of the famous musical,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,4721,"['remembered', 'presentation', 'Camelot', 'originally', 'watching', 'HBO', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'find', 'appreciate', 'now', 'more', 'did', 'then', 'cast', 'spirited', 'presentation', 'certain', 'cases', 'singing', 'improved', 'highly', 'regarded', 'movie', 'version.But', 'first', 'let', 'cover', 'qualities', 'DVD', 'Seeing', 'was', 'mastered', 'tape', 'age', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'Many', 'scenes', 'are', 'extremely', 'sharp', 'few', 'do', 'have', 'grain', 'However', 'do', ""n't"", 'be', 'fooled', 'opening', 'credits', 'look', 'terrible', 'play', 'visuals', 'improve', 'significantly', 'colors', 'are', 'rich', 'set', 'usually', 'somewhat', 'dimly', 'lit', 'production', 'colors', 'come', 'strong', 'varied', 'watched', '55', 'wide-screen', 'flaws', 'video', 'presentation', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'magnified', 'chance', 'Blu', 'ray', 'player', 'receiver', 'are', 'doing', 'outstanding', 'jobs', 'up-scaling.Some', 'reviewers', 'complained', 'problems', 'sound', 'did', 'not', 'experience', 'dialogue', 'was', 'clear', 'music', 'sounded', 'uniformly', 'sharp', 'were', 'couple', 'issues', 'high', 'notes', 'Guinevere', 'songs', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'voice', 'actress', 'distortion', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'tell', 'occurrences', 'were', 'infrequent', 'brief', 'did', 'not', 'annoy.The', 'production', 'obviously', 'embraced', 'performances', 'film', 'director', 'did', 'not', 'decide', 'go', 'off', 'tangent', 'stamp', 'own', 'interpretation', 'material', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'songs', 'might', 'have', 'almost', 'thought', 'was', 'dubbed', 'movie', 'soundtrack', 'timing', 'delivery', 'notes', 'were', 'not', 'exact', 'were', 'VERY', 'close.Richard', 'Harris', 'did', 'seem', 'bit', 'subdued', 'compared', 'film', 'almost', 'film', 'already', 'knew', 'story', 'tragedy', 'certain', 'parts', 'performance', 'were', 'not', 'as', 'crisp', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'multiple', 'stage', 'understandable', 'depiction', 'Arthur', 'pain', 'was', 'deeper', 'film', 'maybe', 'older', 'Harris', 'knew', 'more', 'pain', 'day', 'stage', 'production', 'Let', 'say', 'play', 'made', 'grief', 'real.Meg', 'Bussert', 'Guinevere', 'better', 'singer', 'Vanessa', 'Redgrave', ""n't"", 'give', 'same', 'delicious', 'acting', 'performance', 'However', 'role', 'adequately', 'sell', 'it.Richard', 'Muenz', ""n't"", 'seem', 'get', 'as', 'much', 'stage', 'time', 'Lancelot', 'did', 'film', 'felt', 'barely', 'knew', 'romance', 'Lance', 'Jenny', 'blossomed', 'did', 'great', 'job', ""C'est"", 'Moi', 'possibly', 'personal', 'favorite', 'song', 'Camelot', 'injected', 'just', 'right', 'amount', 'humor', 'element', 'not', 'present', 'sumptuous', 'juxtaposition', 'song', 'travel', 'depicted', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'rendition', 'Ever', 'Could', 'Leave', 'VERY', 'distant', '3rd', 'Robert', 'Goulet', 'original', 'Gene', 'Merlino', 'dub', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'film', 'really', 'very', 'pedestrian', 'performance', 'signature', 'song', 'Muenz', 'voice', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'full', 'rich', 'enough', 'carry', 'off', 'song', 'think', 'knew', 'trying', 'make', 'up', 'was', ""n't"", 'completely', 'key', 'song', 'either.Barrie', 'Ingram', 'was', 'creditable', 'Pelenor', ""n't"", 'compare', 'great', 'Lionel', 'Jeffries.James', 'Valentine', 'wonderful', 'Merlin.Richard', 'Backus', 'Mordred', 'competent', 'performance', 'way', 'sinister', 'presence', 'David', 'Hemmings', 'brought', 'film', 'what', 'soundtrack', 'can', 'imagine', 'Roddy', 'McDowell', 'original', 'play', 'production', 'Seven', 'Deadly', 'Virtues', 'just', 'song', 'quickly', 'not', 'defining', 'statement', 'character', 'menacing', 'warning', 'things', 'come', 'Backus', 'looked', 'what', 'would', 'happen', 'tried', 'place', 'Shaun', 'Cassidy', 'evil', 'role.I', 'never', 'had', 'opportunity', 'see', 'first', 'run', 'play', 'impressive', 'cast', 'own', 'enjoy', 'soundtrack', 'only', 'have', 'two', 'visual', 'presentations', 'material', 'film', 'Camelot', 'stage', 'production', 'prefer', 'film', 'entertaining', 'change', 'pace', 'watching', 'film', 'yet', 'again', 'were', 'alternate', 'decisions', 'songs', 'include', 'here', 'will', 'get', 'hear', 'few', 'were', ""n't"", 'included', 'film', 'Unfortunately', 'make', 'time', 'songs', 'dropped', 'Take', 'Me', 'Fair', 'thought', 'be', 'necessary', 'build', 'tournament.Speaking', 'tournament', 'song', 'chorus', 'action', 'tournament', 'audience', 'reminded', 'amusingly', 'Ascot', 'race', 'Fair', 'Lady', '.To', 'sum', 'up', 'imperfect', 'enjoyable', 'production', 'signature', 'musical', 'one', 'last', 'great', 'musicals', '1967', 'version', 'be', 'filmed.Recommended']",Camelot: Broadway Version

1060275,A2OAAI7R7MMPBK,B000NTM9ZM,"Christopher Nash ""misterphp""","[0, 0]","Richard Harris is brilliant in this stage production, playing the light comedy at the start delightfully, and absolutely breaking your heart during the tragic ending.  He's MUCH better than in the movie, and that was excellent too.  Note how drained he seems as the cast are taking their bows after the final curtain - he can hardly raise a smile, such is the intensity of his performance.  I never had the privilege of seeing him on stage, and now I never will, but this DVD is an enduring tribute to a fine actor in arguably his greatest role.Arthur is the newly crowned King of Britain and is disctinctly uncomfortable with his lot - as well as with his upcoming arranged marriage to Guenevere, a political arrangement to prevent a war. However, when he does meet Guenevere, the chemistry between them is evident and Arthur realises he cannot live without her.Now a happily settled king, he must set about establishing his dream of a utopian kingdom, with justice and fairness for all: might for right instead of might is right. He meets the man who is to become his best friend and champion - Sir Lancelot Du Lac of France. Unfortunately Lance and Jenny (as they are affectionately known to Arthur) will fall in love themselves and this will be exploited by Arthur's illegitimate son Mordred to bring about the death of the King's dream.Richard Harris exceeds the quality of his performance in the movie version, especially in the electrifying final 15 minutes when he seems to BECOME Arthur, such is the intensity of his grief as he bids farewell to his 2 greatest loves and contemplates the return of the hated battles he tried so hard to dispense with forever.If your soul is alive and well, you shouldn't miss out on this wonderful treat.",5,It seems that some of the drops sparkle,1345593600,"08 22, 2012",2012,1746,"['Richard', 'Harris', 'brilliant', 'stage', 'production', 'playing', 'light', 'comedy', 'start', 'delightfully', 'absolutely', 'breaking', 'heart', 'tragic', 'ending', 'MUCH', 'better', 'movie', 'was', 'excellent', 'too', 'Note', 'how', 'drained', 'cast', 'are', 'taking', 'bows', 'final', 'curtain', 'can', 'hardly', 'raise', 'smile', 'such', 'intensity', 'performance', 'never', 'had', 'privilege', 'seeing', 'stage', 'now', 'never', 'will', 'DVD', 'enduring', 'tribute', 'fine', 'actor', 'arguably', 'greatest', 'role.Arthur', 'newly', 'crowned', 'King', 'Britain', 'disctinctly', 'uncomfortable', 'lot', 'as', 'well', 'upcoming', 'arranged', 'marriage', 'Guenevere', 'political', 'arrangement', 'prevent', 'war', 'However', 'when', 'meet', 'Guenevere', 'chemistry', 'evident', 'Arthur', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'happily', 'settled', 'king', 'must', 'set', 'establishing', 'dream', 'utopian', 'kingdom', 'justice', 'fairness', 'might', 'right', 'instead', 'might', 'right', 'man', 'who', 'become', 'best', 'friend', 'champion', 'Sir', 'Lancelot', 'Du', 'Lac', 'France', 'Unfortunately', 'Lance', 'Jenny', 'are', 'affectionately', 'known', 'Arthur', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'will', 'be', 'exploited', 'Arthur', 'illegitimate', 'son', 'Mordred', 'bring', 'about', 'death', 'King', 'dream.Richard', 'Harris', 'quality', 'performance', 'movie', 'version', 'especially', 'electrifying', 'final', '15', 'minutes', 'when', 'BECOME', 'Arthur', 'such', 'intensity', 'grief', 'farewell', '2', 'greatest', 'loves', 'return', 'hated', 'battles', 'tried', 'so', 'hard', 'dispense', 'forever.If', 'soul', 'alive', 'well', 'should', ""n't"", 'miss', 'out', 'wonderful', 'treat']",Camelot: Broadway Version

1060277,A2UEJEAUKIWEFH,B000NTM9ZM,Dennis A. Pascale,"[0, 0]","I was lucky to see this production of Camelot when it aired on HBO, and I was enchanted by it.  I was so happy to find it out on DVD.  Richard Harris is wonderful as King Arthur.  He plays Arthur as a true innocent who, as he goes along on this journey, learns the harsh lessons about life and love, yet still manages to give us a glimpse of hope at things to come.  By the end of the play, as tears roll down his cheeks and he proclaims &#34;For One Brief Shining Moment!&#34; I found myself with tears in my eyes and glad to have been along for his journey.  Meg Bussert as Queen Guenevere is simply marvelous.  (If you close your eyes, it's amazing how close she sounds like Julie Andrews).  Richard Meunz as Lancelot is also very good.  He does well playing Lancelot as a sort of fop we all love to hate who eventually shows us that he's more than he seems.  The three main leas do their parts justice.  Be warned though, if you've never seen Camelot before, this is not a &#34;light&#34; musical by any means.  Though it visually looks like something Disney would produce, (and the sets are a joy to look at), this is very much an adult musical.  It's amazing how this play starts off very light in tone, only to become very serious and touching.  Most people know the story and of the ill-fated love triangle between the three main characters.  Lerner & Loewe should be given a lot of credit for crafting a lavish tale such as this that deals with such grim subject matter yet handles it beautifully.  There are no simple solutions and many of the characters have to live with the choices they've made.  There's no tidy &#34;happy ending&#34; if you will.  You get a wonderful musical with lavish sets and costumes, some great tunes that will stick with you, but you will also experience various emotions along the way.  The actors are wonderful to watch.  The camera angles and close ups reveal their facial expressions.  Though the song &#34;What Do the Simple Folk Do?&#34; is very light and comic, it's the undertones and the body langue of Harris and Bussert that reveal the character's true feelings.  Arthur is starting to realize that his marriage is coming apart and is helpless to prevent it.  Another review has stated how Richard Harris doesn't really sing in this musical.  You have to appreciate Lerner & Loewe.  This is not a big, splashy musical with showstopping tunes.  Many of the songs are simply sung dialogue.  Check out some of the songs from their other musical &#34;My Fair Lady.&#34;  Rex Harrison did much the same thing with many of the songs in that show as well.  I only have a few complaints about this DVD.  One, I would love to have had it in Blu-ray.  And Second, I would have loved to have had some special features.  Be sure to read the small enclosed booklet by Meg Bussert, but that simply left me wanting more.  Other than that, this is a great musical that was filmed with a lot of love and care.

All the leads are superb, especially Richard Muenz and Meg Bussert.  I am so happy now to own a copy of this.  The production itself certainly deserves 5 or more stars.  The DVD release could have been done better, however.  I wish the picture quality were a little sharper.  It seems there should be a better master tape of this.  My other issue with the DVD is it is missing some material.  During the HBO production, there were full recordings of the Overture and Entr'acte played. This was music only played against a stagnant backdrop.  Yes, it is not much to look at, but the music was glorious and it is now missing.  When A&E repeated the program, they kept this music but spoke over it, relegating the music to the background.

While there may ""not be a more congenial spot than Camelot,"" this Camelot is ruled by a king who is more leche that liege.As a former Broadway director/choreographer and actor, and one who has directed Camelot as well as seen many productions of it including the original, you can not begin to imagine my utter dismay with this production.  From the moment the aging and foppish Richard Harris began prancing about the stage without motivation or apparent direction while mugging to the audience and incessantly twirling his stadium scarf like some amateur stripper twirling a boa, I was appaled. I was not expecting Burton; was only hoping that I might find the King Arthur of the film; but certainly did not expect to find a Richard Harris festooned in undecipherable garb and topped with a blond page boy hair style makimg him appear (and act) more Duke (Patty) than King (Arthur).  What Harris lost in appearance and demeanor he totally forfeited in acting and singing.  While never all that gifted an actor or singer, what little gift he had has since been given away. . . far, far away.Meg Bussert's singing was adequate but she seemed unsure of who her character was exactly.  Was she the young frightened innocent finding herself in a strange land to marry a man she had never met, or a modern day twenty-something looking for someone, anyone, with whom to ""hook-up.""  We are never quite sure, but this audience member could smell the wood burning beneath the stake during the opening number in which she seemed part Guinevere and part Ado Annie ready to break any moment into a quick rendition of ""I'm Just A Girl Who Can't Say No.""There is simply nothing to like about this production of Camelot.  The sets are symbolic of nothing; the properties are anachronistic such as the yard lanterns carried in the medieval wedding ceremony; the staging is something you might expect from a director of MTV videos (Oh, that's right, it was directed by an MTV video director!); the choreography is Martha Graham meets Monty Python; the sound is as if it were recorded in a box car; and the film itself is grainey and poorly focused.Now the performace is not without merit.  I am currently using it in both my directing and acting classes at the university where I teach as examples of bad directing and bad acting.  It is perfect for that purpose.Camelot is an under-appreciated Lerner and Loewe show and this production will do nothing to change that. Instead, and while I am loath to recommend film versions of Broadway musicals, buy the film version.  It is not totally true to the original and while Richard Harris still stars as Arthur, his boyish good looks come across more as impish rather than lascivious (as should be), and the production is breathtakingly beautiful.",1,A Not So Brief and Shining Moment,1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2807,"['Run', 'away', 'Guinevere', 'run', 'away', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'congenial', 'spot', 'Camelot', 'Camelot', 'ruled', 'king', 'who', 'more', 'leche', 'former', 'Broadway', 'director/choreographer', 'actor', 'one', 'who', 'directed', 'Camelot', 'as', 'well', 'seen', 'many', 'productions', 'including', 'original', 'can', 'not', 'begin', 'imagine', 'utter', 'dismay', 'production', 'moment', 'aging', 'foppish', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'began', 'prancing', 'stage', 'motivation', 'apparent', 'direction', 'mugging', 'audience', 'incessantly', 'twirling', 'stadium', 'scarf', 'amateur', 'stripper', 'twirling', 'boa', 'was', 'appaled', 'was', 'not', 'expecting', 'Burton', 'was', 'only', 'hoping', 'might', 'find', 'King', 'Arthur', 'film', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'expect', 'find', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'festooned', 'undecipherable', 'garb', 'topped', 'blond', 'page', 'boy', 'hair', 'style', 'makimg', 'appear', 'act', 'more', 'Duke', 'Patty', 'King', 'Arthur', 'What', 'Harris', 'lost', 'appearance', 'demeanor', 'totally', 'forfeited', 'acting', 'singing', 'never', 'gifted', 'actor', 'singer', 'what', 'little', 'gift', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'away', 'far', 'far', 'Bussert', 'singing', 'was', 'adequate', 'seemed', 'unsure', 'who', 'character', 'was', 'exactly', 'Was', 'young', 'frightened', 'innocent', 'finding', 'strange', 'land', 'marry', 'man', 'had', 'never', 'met', 'modern', 'day', 'twenty-something', 'looking', 'someone', 'anyone', 'whom', 'hook-up', 'are', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'audience', 'member', 'could', 'smell', 'wood', 'burning', 'stake', 'opening', 'number', 'seemed', 'part', 'Guinevere', 'part', 'Ado', 'Annie', 'ready', 'break', 'moment', 'quick', 'rendition', ""'m"", 'Just', 'A', 'Girl', 'Who', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Say', 'No', 'simply', 'nothing', 'like', 'production', 'Camelot', 'sets', 'are', 'symbolic', 'nothing', 'properties', 'are', 'anachronistic', 'such', 'yard', 'carried', 'medieval', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'staging', 'something', 'might', 'expect', 'director', 'MTV', 'videos', 'Oh', 'right', 'was', 'directed', 'MTV', 'video', 'director', 'choreography', 'Martha', 'Graham', 'meets', 'Monty', 'Python', 'sound', 'were', 'recorded', 'box', 'car', 'film', 'grainey', 'poorly', 'focused.Now', 'performace', 'not', 'merit', 'am', 'currently', 'using', 'directing', 'acting', 'classes', 'university', 'where', 'teach', 'examples', 'bad', 'directing', 'bad', 'acting', 'perfect', 'purpose.Camelot', 'under-appreciated', 'Lerner', 'Loewe', 'show', 'production', 'will', 'do', 'nothing', 'change', 'Instead', 'am', 'loath', 'recommend', 'film', 'versions', 'Broadway', 'musicals', 'buy', 'film', 'version', 'not', 'totally', 'true', 'original', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'still', 'Arthur', 'boyish', 'good', 'looks', 'come', 'across', 'more', 'impish', 'rather', 'lascivious', 'should', 'be', 'production', 'breathtakingly', 'beautiful']",Camelot: Broadway Version

This version, recorded from the Winter Garden theater's '80's revival, should come as a pleasant surprise to fans of the musical, in that it has clearer storytelling, excellent staging, and a wonderful cast (led by Richard Harris, who may be a bit old at this point to convey Arthur's youthful innocence and enthusiasm for the Camelot code). Missing from this production is the number covering Guinivere's clever and delightfully playful goading of her knights against Sir Lancelot in the joust: a pity, since it was one of the show's highlights. Meg Bussert is a beautiful and engaging Guinivere, and she sings with a power and skill Vanessa Redgrave (star of the film) didn't possess. Despite the stage-bound nature of this presentation, the sets are gorgeous, the performances are first rate, the color lovely, and the score is memorable (though not quite as thrilling as Lerner and Loewe's ""My Fair Lady"" which may be the duo's most lasting legacy. This version stays true to the innocence and the integrity of the original play, in which Guinivere and Lancelot's affection was noble, not carnal--and it makes a world of difference in the tragic aspects of the finale.

The visual presentation and sound quality were light years ahead of most other such offerings, and it was shot and edited to perfection.I saw this revival onstage, then on HBO, and it is something to see. Richard Harris and Meg Bussert were just right together, and the supporting cast was excellent as well. The sets, costumes, and lighting added to the beauty of the evening.

She left my life without getting that tape back, so I have watched it many times over the years, all the while hoping for a DVD release for all our sakes. I have it now & hope they do as well! As of this writing, 7/8/14, it is on Amazon Instant Video as well. I'm so glad this production is being put out. I absolutely love it!  It  is far superior to the dark depressing film version which sucked the life out of  the magnificent Lerner & Lowe songs! I love the humorous edges here, even to Mordred's villainy! Casting is great & the filming of the stage production is truly wonderful, particularly for those, like me, who have little access to the theater! With no offense to Meg Bussert, I wish my dream pairing of Julie Andrews & Richard Harris had happened too!",5,I'm so glad this production is being put out,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",2014,853,"['did', ""n't"", 'get', 'HBO', 'when', 'ran', 'friend', 'loaned', 'family', 'precious', 'VHS', 'copy', 'left', 'life', 'getting', 'tape', 'back', 'have', 'watched', 'many', 'times', 'years', 'while', 'hoping', 'DVD', 'release', 'sakes', 'have', 'now', 'hope', 'do', 'as', 'well', 'writing', '7/8/14', 'Amazon', 'Instant', 'Video', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'so', 'glad', 'production', 'being', 'put', 'out', 'absolutely', 'love', 'far', 'superior', 'dark', 'depressing', 'film', 'version', 'sucked', 'life', 'magnificent', 'Lerner', 'Lowe', 'love', 'humorous', 'edges', 'here', 'even', 'Mordred', 'villainy', 'Casting', 'great', 'filming', 'stage', 'production', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'particularly', 'who', 'have', 'little', 'access', 'theater', 'offense', 'Meg', 'Bussert', 'wish', 'dream', 'pairing', 'Julie', 'Andrews', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'had', 'happened', 'too']",Camelot: Broadway Version
