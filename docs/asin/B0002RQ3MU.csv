But Mabel and Shirley, and Fred and dead now may the R.I.P..They are gone but they are not forgotten their legacy will live forever. I liked this show it was so wonderful and in this second season it contains that gong show episode when Dee and Raj manages this kiddie group I used to love to see them perform that song ""Bubbly Brown Sugar"" I love it and those kids were the cutest and they could really sing I wonder if the girl is famous and if she has a singing career  she should have because she and thos boys were very talented. I liked when Wolfman Jack had called them ""Little Gladys Knight and the Pips"" I thought that was so cute . I especially enjoyed their performance at the talent show when they were singing the boys chanted"" (BE BEEP, BE BEEP)!!!! and the little girl sings a little verse of Billie Holiday Papa May Have, Mama May Have and God Bless the Child"" it was all of that I love this episode.

There are some standout outings in this release that made me laugh very hard, but I'm not going to go into detail about that. I will just say that it, like #1, is a very good purchase if you are a fan of the cleaner comedy of the past. I will echo what some other reviewers have said-- that this one and #1 are the two best seasons of the series. I am kind of leery about #3 though, because I have heard that the series jumped the shark in that final season with the change of direction to apartment life and the introduction of a cop and his son and the departure of Mabel King.Therefore, that said, if you purchase any of ""What's Happening!!"" on DVD, I would advise that you purchase #1 or #2 or both-- stay clear away from #3 unless you can stomach a cop and his son and the extreme change in format, among other things.

843888,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B0002RQ3MU,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[27, 27]","The 1970s was the true hey-day of television, and What's Happening!! was one of the real gems of that era; it is one of the funniest sit-coms of all time.  This show was a staple of my after-school afternoons when I was growing up.  I've seen every episode more times than I can count, but it had been years since my last trip to the soda shop and Mama's house.  Watching these shows again now, I have to say they are funnier than ever.  Season Two was probably the best season of them all, filled with one memorable show after another.Just look at all the things that happen in Season Two: Rerun gets married - almost - to a pretty little foreigner played by Irene Cara; Tim Reid shows up to counsel Dee about ""her friend's problem.""  Raj ends up in small claims court (with Dwayne as his key witness) when he wrecks his delivery bike; Raj almost gets expelled when he starts an underground school newspaper; Dwayne's dad gets elected to the city council; Raj's and Dee's father gets married - in their house; Mama goes back to school; Raj organizes (then tries to disorganize) a strike at the market where he works; Raj wins a spot on The Gong Show for a quartet of singers in Dee's class; Dee goes on her first date; Rerun messes up big-time and finds himself illegally taping a Doobie Brothers concert; Rerun joins a cult that worships a head of lettuce called Ralph (one of the stupidest but funniest TV episodes ever); and Rerun finally - finally - graduates from high school.The characters of Dee and Shirley (my two favorites) really grow during this second season of the show.  We watch Shirley take a secretarial job, only to learn she was only hired because she was black, then later see her take on a motherly role with Raj and Dee.  Dee's mouth is bigger than ever (is there a better, funnier smart aleck to be found in television land?), but we actually see a little bit of Dee's soft side emerge late in the season.Several other reviewers have mentioned Dwayne's ""Handyman"" song and dance as, going and away, the funniest scene of the whole season.  I wholeheartedly agree - that performance is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life.  All of the episodes are hilarious, though - every single one of them.  You spend your hard-earned money on a lot of DVD season sets and never watch the episodes a second time; with What's Happening!! you can watch the same old DVDs over and over again because the comedy never grows old.  It would have been nice to see some extra features included here, but this is a true bargain at any price.  If you have great memories of this show, get this DVD and rediscover the good old days spent with Raj, Rerun, and Dwayne.  If you've never seen this show, you have no idea what you're missing - they don't make shows like this anymore.",5,Remember when sit-coms were actually funny?,1106006400,"01 18, 2005",2005,2798,"['1970s', 'was', 'true', 'hey-day', 'television', 'What', 'Happening', 'was', 'one', 'real', 'gems', 'era', 'one', 'funniest', 'sit-coms', 'time', 'show', 'was', 'staple', 'after-school', 'afternoons', 'when', 'was', 'growing', 'up', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'episode', 'more', 'times', 'can', 'count', 'had', 'been', 'years', 'last', 'trip', 'soda', 'shop', 'Mama', 'house', 'Watching', 'shows', 'again', 'now', 'have', 'say', 'are', 'funnier', 'ever', 'Season', 'Two', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'season', 'filled', 'one', 'memorable', 'show', 'another.Just', 'look', 'things', 'happen', 'Season', 'Two', 'Rerun', 'married', 'almost', 'pretty', 'little', 'foreigner', 'played', 'Irene', 'Cara', 'Tim', 'Reid', 'up', 'counsel', 'Dee', 'friend', 'problem', 'Raj', 'up', 'small', 'claims', 'court', 'Dwayne', 'key', 'witness', 'when', 'delivery', 'bike', 'Raj', 'almost', 'expelled', 'when', 'underground', 'school', 'newspaper', 'Dwayne', 'dad', 'elected', 'city', 'council', 'Raj', 'Dee', 'father', 'married', 'house', 'Mama', 'back', 'school', 'Raj', 'then', 'disorganize', 'strike', 'market', 'where', 'Raj', 'spot', 'Gong', 'Show', 'quartet', 'singers', 'Dee', 'class', 'Dee', 'first', 'date', 'Rerun', 'big-time', 'illegally', 'taping', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'concert', 'Rerun', 'cult', 'head', 'lettuce', 'called', 'Ralph', 'one', 'stupidest', 'funniest', 'TV', 'episodes', 'ever', 'Rerun', 'finally', 'finally', 'graduates', 'high', 'school.The', 'characters', 'Dee', 'Shirley', 'two', 'favorites', 'really', 'grow', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'watch', 'Shirley', 'take', 'secretarial', 'job', 'only', 'learn', 'was', 'only', 'hired', 'was', 'black', 'then', 'later', 'see', 'take', 'motherly', 'role', 'Raj', 'Dee', 'Dee', 'mouth', 'bigger', 'ever', 'there', 'better', 'funnier', 'smart', 'aleck', 'be', 'found', 'television', 'land', 'actually', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'Dee', 'soft', 'side', 'emerge', 'late', 'season.Several', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Dwayne', 'Handyman', 'song', 'dance', 'going', 'away', 'funniest', 'scene', 'whole', 'season', 'wholeheartedly', 'agree', 'performance', 'one', 'funniest', 'things', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'life', 'episodes', 'are', 'hilarious', 'single', 'one', 'spend', 'hard-earned', 'money', 'lot', 'DVD', 'season', 'sets', 'never', 'watch', 'episodes', 'second', 'time', 'What', 'Happening', 'can', 'watch', 'same', 'old', 'DVDs', 'over', 'again', 'comedy', 'never', 'old', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'extra', 'features', 'included', 'here', 'true', 'bargain', 'price', 'have', 'great', 'memories', 'show', 'get', 'DVD', 'rediscover', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'spent', 'Raj', 'Rerun', 'Dwayne', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'have', 'idea', 'what', ""'re"", 'missing', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'shows', 'anymore']",What's Happening!! - The Complete Second Season

We still have the same quirky characters and their shenanigans and it's just as funny.  Dee is still bratty but she tones it down a bit and shows a softer side.  She's just as funny though.  Some of the memorable episodes are the one where Rerun's brother in law gambled his vacation money on a football game based on Rerun's advice which was based on Dwayne's ""system"" of picking the team with the fancier helmets, the one when Rerun shaved his head and joined a lettuce worshipping cult, the two part episode where the boys were forced to tape the Doobie Brothers concert and who can forget Dwayne singing ""Handy Man"" in class?  The writing hardly missed a beat!Unfortunately Mabel King (""Mama"" Mabel Thomas) would pass on two decades later as well as Shirley Hemphill (Shirley) and Fred Berry (Rerun).  Thankfully the series is on DVD to help keep their memories alive as well as reminiscing of a time when television could be clean and funny at the same time.",5,Picking up smoothly from the first season.,1132358400,"11 19, 2005",2005,1025,"['Season', 'two', 'where', 'season', 'one', 'left', 'off', 'very', 'smoothly', 'still', 'have', 'same', 'quirky', 'characters', 'shenanigans', 'just', 'funny', 'Dee', 'still', 'bratty', 'down', 'bit', 'softer', 'side', 'just', 'funny', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'are', 'one', 'where', 'Rerun', 'brother', 'law', 'gambled', 'vacation', 'money', 'football', 'game', 'based', 'Rerun', 'advice', 'was', 'based', 'Dwayne', 'system', 'picking', 'team', 'fancier', 'helmets', 'one', 'when', 'Rerun', 'shaved', 'head', 'joined', 'lettuce', 'worshipping', 'cult', 'two', 'part', 'episode', 'where', 'boys', 'were', 'forced', 'tape', 'Doobie', 'Brothers', 'concert', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Dwayne', 'singing', 'Handy', 'Man', 'class', 'writing', 'hardly', 'missed', 'beat', 'Unfortunately', 'Mabel', 'King', 'Mama', 'Mabel', 'Thomas', 'would', 'pass', 'two', 'decades', 'later', 'as', 'well', 'Shirley', 'Hemphill', 'Shirley', 'Fred', 'Berry', 'Rerun', 'Thankfully', 'series', 'DVD', 'help', 'keep', 'memories', 'alive', 'as', 'well', 'reminiscing', 'time', 'when', 'television', 'could', 'be', 'clean', 'funny', 'same', 'time']",What's Happening!! - The Complete Second Season

I grew up on sitcoms from the 70's, so I could really appreciate how well written this show was compared to the utter crap of sitcoms today. It's been wonderful to revisit these charaters, especially the late Fred Berry. He was my favorite character,because he possessed so much self confidence despite being overweight. I also have to admit that I have watched the episode when the Doobie Brothers guest-starred about 20 times!!! I fell in love with their music all over again and Michael McDonald has the most gorgeous blue eyes!!! I can hardly wait for the third season to be released! I can think of alot of other classic sitcoms that are long overdue to be released on DVD like, Maude,Alice,and in honor of Tony Randall the Odd Couple!!! In the meantime I'll continue to enjoy the gang from What's Happening!!!
