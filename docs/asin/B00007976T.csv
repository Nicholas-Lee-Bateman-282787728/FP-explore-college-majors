725224,AO3JW5VHT2GQ,B00007976T,A Customer,"[9, 12]","Summary:Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams) has been working in the film developing department at Sav Mart for quite awhile now.  Seymour (Sy) doesn't have much to look forward to outside of work, but there is one thing he cherishes - the Yorkin family: Nina (Connie Nielsen (I)), Will (Michael Vartan), and Jake (Dylan Smith (III)).  Sy 'the photo guy' has been developing their film since before Jake was born and has begun to feel like an uncle to Jake and a member of the family - he knows just about everything about them.  When his manager at work begins giving him a hard time, Sy immerses himself more deeply into his fantasies as a member of the Yorkin family, until he finds out that this seemingly perfect family isn't so perfect.  Taking matters into his own hands, Sy, likely using personal childhood recollections to guide him, resorts to unorthodox means to break the news to Nina about why Will is such a neglectful father.My Comments:This was a really well thought out and marvelously designed movie.  Robin Williams does a great job.  Almost the entire movie follows Robin Williams's character who says surprisingly little - but you are still entranced by what is going on.  The rest of the acting is pretty good as well.The special features of the DVD talk about how the SavMart has been designed to represent something of a fantasy world for Sy; I think that is something you kind of put together subconsciously, but when it is made clear what they have done it adds depth to the movie and Sy's character.  Though it seems straightforward,  there is so much going on the film that you can't really afford to miss any of it - you have to pay very close attention.The extra features on the DVD contain lots of commentary and some fun interviews - Robin Williams is hilarious in the Charlie Rose interview.Overall, I thought this was a great movie.  Excellent story, superb cinematography, and remarkable acting.  The social commentary was appropriately subtle but present in everything.  There is a bit of nudity, so if you don't care for that you may want to skip this one.  Otherwise, I highly recommend it.",5,Loved it.,1051833600,"05 2, 2003",2003,2124,"['Summary', 'Seymour', 'Parrish', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'been', 'working', 'film', 'developing', 'department', 'Sav', 'Mart', 'quite', 'awhile', 'now', 'Seymour', 'Sy', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'look', 'forward', 'outside', 'work', 'one', 'thing', 'Yorkin', 'family', 'Nina', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'Will', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Jake', 'Dylan', 'Smith', 'III', 'Sy', 'photo', 'guy', 'been', 'developing', 'film', 'Jake', 'was', 'born', 'begun', 'feel', 'uncle', 'Jake', 'member', 'family', 'just', 'everything', 'When', 'manager', 'work', 'begins', 'giving', 'hard', 'time', 'Sy', 'more', 'deeply', 'fantasies', 'member', 'Yorkin', 'family', 'out', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'family', ""n't"", 'so', 'perfect', 'Taking', 'matters', 'own', 'hands', 'Sy', 'likely', 'using', 'personal', 'childhood', 'recollections', 'guide', 'unorthodox', 'means', 'break', 'news', 'Nina', 'why', 'Will', 'such', 'neglectful', 'father.My', 'Comments', 'was', 'really', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'marvelously', 'designed', 'movie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'great', 'job', 'entire', 'movie', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'character', 'who', 'surprisingly', 'little', 'are', 'still', 'entranced', 'what', 'going', 'rest', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'well.The', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'talk', 'how', 'SavMart', 'been', 'designed', 'represent', 'something', 'fantasy', 'world', 'Sy', 'think', 'something', 'kind', 'put', 'together', 'subconsciously', 'when', 'made', 'clear', 'what', 'have', 'done', 'depth', 'movie', 'Sy', 'character', 'straightforward', 'so', 'much', 'going', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'afford', 'miss', 'have', 'pay', 'very', 'close', 'attention.The', 'extra', 'features', 'DVD', 'contain', 'lots', 'commentary', 'fun', 'interviews', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'hilarious', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'interview.Overall', 'thought', 'was', 'great', 'movie', 'Excellent', 'story', 'superb', 'cinematography', 'remarkable', 'acting', 'social', 'commentary', 'was', 'appropriately', 'subtle', 'present', 'everything', 'bit', 'nudity', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'may', 'want', 'skip', 'one', 'Otherwise', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A
725225,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,B00007976T,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[5, 5]","One Hour Photo is a high caliber psychological drama starring Robin Williams in his best performance to date. Here Robin's latest non-comedic role is that of Sy the Photo Guy, a friendless, familyless worker at a One Hour Photo shop whose abused childhood is about to catch up with him. He insinuates himself into the Yorkin family whom he developes film for, going so far as to read a Deepak Chopra book because he glimpses it in Nina Yorkin's (Connie Nielsen's) bag. The book quote he gives her gives a strong clue to the film's true theme, ""What we fear most already happened"".  Sy sees the Yorkins as the ideal family that he never had, making extra sets of their photos to put on his wall.Throughout we get an ominous humming background soundtrack a la Safe as well as a violin motif borrowed from Requiem for a Dream (borrowed from Laurie Anderson). This film has been compared to Taxi Driver, but more appropriate comparison would be Midnight Cowboy.  The parallel to Joe Buck's isolation and naivetee, his disconnection with the TV and radio shows he watches/listens to for example is strikingly similar.  And both films are a subjective jump into the character's isolation, demons, and emotions.Sy's lid on those demons is blown when he sees photo evidence of Will Yorkin's (Michael Vartan's) infidelity...and gets fired by a fascist boss (Gary Cole). Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle) serves as liaison between Sy and the audience, as he tries to grasp what we try to. One significant hint is when he says, ""Well he knew that Yoshi (Paul Kim) would come to you and you would call us"", i.e. Sy set up this elaborate plan to get caught (to get attention).  And finally in cathartic release acts out his own abuse, his abusive father taking him over. Then the regression to the ideal childhood, hence the photos of objects a la Jake's photos. Importantly we don't know all this until the end, when he explains it to the detective...in a manner that can easily go over the heads of a mainstream audience.  What sums up Sy's tortured world best is the shock registered on the expression of Maya (Erin Daniels).Keep your eyes peeled for any Academy politics that would prevent deserved Oscars for Robin Williams and Mark Romanek.",5,Best Actor Oscar Robin Williams/Best Screenplay Mark Romanek,1032566400,"09 21, 2002",2002,2237,"['One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'high', 'caliber', 'psychological', 'drama', 'starring', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'Here', 'Robin', 'latest', 'non-comedic', 'role', 'Sy', 'Photo', 'Guy', 'friendless', 'familyless', 'worker', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'shop', 'abused', 'childhood', 'catch', 'up', 'Yorkin', 'family', 'whom', 'film', 'going', 'so', 'far', 'read', 'Deepak', 'Chopra', 'book', 'Nina', 'Yorkin', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'bag', 'book', 'quote', 'strong', 'clue', 'film', 'true', 'theme', 'What', 'fear', 'most', 'already', 'happened', 'Sy', 'Yorkins', 'ideal', 'family', 'never', 'had', 'making', 'extra', 'sets', 'photos', 'put', 'wall.Throughout', 'get', 'ominous', 'humming', 'background', 'soundtrack', 'la', 'Safe', 'as', 'well', 'violin', 'motif', 'borrowed', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'borrowed', 'Laurie', 'Anderson', 'film', 'been', 'compared', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'more', 'appropriate', 'comparison', 'would', 'be', 'Midnight', 'Cowboy', 'parallel', 'Joe', 'Buck', 'isolation', 'naivetee', 'disconnection', 'TV', 'radio', 'shows', 'example', 'strikingly', 'similar', 'films', 'are', 'subjective', 'jump', 'character', 'isolation', 'demons', 'emotions.Sy', 'lid', 'demons', 'blown', 'when', 'photo', 'evidence', 'Will', 'Yorkin', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'infidelity', 'fired', 'fascist', 'boss', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Detective', 'Van', 'Der', 'Zee', 'Eriq', 'La', 'Salle', 'liaison', 'Sy', 'audience', 'grasp', 'what', 'try', 'One', 'significant', 'hint', 'when', 'Well', 'knew', 'Yoshi', 'Paul', 'Kim', 'would', 'come', 'would', 'call', 'i.e', 'Sy', 'set', 'up', 'elaborate', 'plan', 'get', 'caught', 'get', 'attention', 'finally', 'cathartic', 'release', 'out', 'own', 'abuse', 'abusive', 'father', 'taking', 'Then', 'regression', 'ideal', 'childhood', 'hence', 'photos', 'objects', 'la', 'Jake', 'photos', 'Importantly', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'end', 'when', 'detective', 'manner', 'can', 'easily', 'go', 'heads', 'mainstream', 'audience', 'What', 'sums', 'up', 'Sy', 'tortured', 'world', 'best', 'shock', 'registered', 'expression', 'Maya', 'Erin', 'Daniels', '.Keep', 'eyes', 'peeled', 'Academy', 'politics', 'would', 'prevent', 'deserved', 'Oscars', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Mark', 'Romanek']",N/A

Williams has turned in a melange of performances in twenty years: some gripping, and some cliche.  He's good at extroverted bursts of energy; he can also soften his eyes and wrap himself around your heart.  This, however, is his finest hour.  He completely departs from his previous characters and creates a character that is fully realized, multi-dimensional, and psychologically on-target.  It his breakthrough performance as a serious actor.It would be a shame, however, not to notice that this is also a very well-made film.  A very sad but all-too-familiar story about loneliness and social isolation unfolds at a compelling pace, with a script that resists patronizing its subject or sensationalizing it.  We have no choice but to notice the use of color to distinguish worlds; the flat, washed-out landscape in which Sy is imprisoned, and the lush, brilliant hues of the family life he aches for.As events unfold, we stick to Sy's personal tragedy and his rage rather than follow standard horror-movie cliches, making the suspense and the horror genuine and harrowing.

I've never seen Williams give such a serious performance.  Chilling, really.  He plays a 1-hr. photo store clerk who has a particular obsession with one family (the Yorkins) and tries to find ways to integrate himself with them.  Mostly he daydreams and watches from afar that is until he discovers the affair Will Yorkin is having behind his wife and son's back with a coworker.  This shatters his picture of a perfect family and a happy life.  What this epiphany leads him to do is something you'll have to watch the movie for.As a side note.  I had to laugh at the blatant product placements used in the film.  It's not enough that Sy works at SavMart, but he also has to travel down the aisles and take a rest on a bed with Hello Kitty.  And what about the PlayStation game young Jake plays?  Or the Sony HDTV in the living room?  Or the fact that the husband even knows the brand of his wife's designer blouse?You can tell I really have nothing bad to say, if all I could comment on was product placement.  You caught me.

Sy is a lonely man, with seemingly no friends or family, and whose life revolves around other people's lives - mainly, the Yorkins, who have been having their family photos developed by Sy for the past 9 years. Sy takes a liking to the family - a young married couple and their 9-year-old son - and always makes an extra set of their pictures...to plaster all over his wall.

Nobody ever snaps a picture of the first fall on a bicycle.  You never see a picture of your first heart break tears or pictures of Dad after the remote control mysteriously flew across the room.  It's as if we paint this picture of our lives with snapshots of smiling happy moments in time that are soon forgotten after a cloud of sadness washes over the landscape.

Not having any friends or family, he fascinates about being a part of their family.  Robin Williams does a very impressive job of playing this lead character.  The problem is, he almost does too good of a job.  Over the course of the film, as his mental state deteriorates from harmlessly eccentric to dangerously obsessive, you begin to feel incredibly sorry for him. At the same time, you find yourself sinking into a depressed state.  This is one of the darkest films I've ever seen and takes the viewer into the lowest regions of a mentally ill man's soul.  Unfortunately, it is one of the most depressing films I've ever seen as a result.  And I have to give credit to the creators of the film for pulling off such an endeavor.

That isn't to say that the film itself is a masterpiece by any means, for I think that it may be a little too aware of itself to be that impressionable, but at the end of the day this is certainly a film you will remember; quite vividly even.  In fact, years after the fact there is a crisp whiteness that I don't think I'll ever forget (the cinematography itself is rather remarkable; the camera catching so much with so little).Robin Williams takes his usual persona and tosses it on its head rather abruptly with his astonishing turn as Seymour Parrish, a lonely and isolated one-hour photo technician who becomes disturbingly obsessed with a young couple who frequent the photo department.  His obsession helps ease his loneliness, as he mentally adopts this family as his own.  That said obsession starts to deteriorate his sanity though, and soon it drives him to acts of unwarranted insanity as he begins to interfere with their lives in ways that are not his right.Williams is certainly in a different zone than usual.  He is effectively creepy and really grounds this film in areas that are a little shaky.  He is wholly convincing and crawls beneath your skin, but not in a way that makes him ultimately repulsive.  In fact, despite his maniacal eventualities, there is something endearing about this crazy man.  You want him to find solace because it is apparent that his overreactions are syphoned from his desperation and internal torment.  He just wants to love, and he thought he found a purity in this young couple he took into his heart, and when realities come to his attention he feels genuinely heartbroken.  Robin Williams conveys that magnificently, and it is his performance that you will remember more than any other aspect of this film (that, and the white).As a whole though, `One Hour Photo' doesn't always find its footing.  I mentioned earlier that the film was a little too aware of itself, and that problem rears its head in areas that defeat the integral purpose of the film.  While Williams maintains his characters depth, the details that permeate each scene can overtake things a bit.  As I said in my review title, it's that coldness that is a double edged sword here.  It is effectively chilling, and that is necessary with this breed of film, but it is that same coldness that can make it difficult to wholly connect with the film.  It is a chilling atmosphere, but it needed a few more shades (maybe a little warmth) to feel complete.  Instead, it becomes overwhelming and comes across almost overtly serious.  It takes itself too seriously, which isn't to say that the film shouldn't feel serious (especially considering the subject matter) but it needed more emotional complexities to feel truly grounded and whole.Robin Williams is outstanding, but the film lacks the shading needed to truly anchor this in greatness.",3,The coldness is a plus and a negative...,1316044800,"09 15, 2011",2011,2913,"['One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'not', 'film', 'will', 'soon', 'forget', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'masterpiece', 'means', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'aware', 'be', 'impressionable', 'end', 'day', 'certainly', 'film', 'will', 'remember', 'quite', 'vividly', 'even', 'fact', 'years', 'fact', 'crisp', 'whiteness', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'forget', 'cinematography', 'rather', 'remarkable', 'camera', 'catching', 'so', 'much', 'so', 'little', '.Robin', 'Williams', 'usual', 'persona', 'head', 'rather', 'abruptly', 'astonishing', 'turn', 'Seymour', 'Parrish', 'lonely', 'isolated', 'one-hour', 'photo', 'technician', 'who', 'disturbingly', 'obsessed', 'young', 'couple', 'who', 'frequent', 'photo', 'department', 'obsession', 'ease', 'loneliness', 'mentally', 'family', 'own', 'said', 'obsession', 'starts', 'deteriorate', 'sanity', 'soon', 'acts', 'unwarranted', 'insanity', 'interfere', 'lives', 'ways', 'are', 'not', 'right.Williams', 'certainly', 'different', 'zone', 'usual', 'effectively', 'creepy', 'really', 'film', 'areas', 'are', 'little', 'shaky', 'wholly', 'convincing', 'crawls', 'beneath', 'skin', 'not', 'way', 'ultimately', 'repulsive', 'fact', 'maniacal', 'eventualities', 'something', 'endearing', 'crazy', 'man', 'want', 'find', 'solace', 'apparent', 'overreactions', 'are', 'syphoned', 'desperation', 'internal', 'torment', 'just', 'love', 'thought', 'found', 'purity', 'young', 'couple', 'took', 'heart', 'when', 'realities', 'come', 'attention', 'genuinely', 'heartbroken', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'conveys', 'magnificently', 'performance', 'will', 'remember', 'more', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'white', '.As', 'whole', 'though', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', ""n't"", 'always', 'find', 'footing', 'mentioned', 'earlier', 'film', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'aware', 'problem', 'head', 'areas', 'defeat', 'integral', 'purpose', 'film', 'Williams', 'characters', 'depth', 'details', 'permeate', 'scene', 'can', 'overtake', 'things', 'bit', 'said', 'review', 'title', 'coldness', 'double', 'edged', 'sword', 'here', 'effectively', 'chilling', 'necessary', 'breed', 'film', 'same', 'coldness', 'can', 'make', 'difficult', 'wholly', 'connect', 'film', 'chilling', 'atmosphere', 'needed', 'few', 'more', 'shades', 'maybe', 'little', 'warmth', 'feel', 'complete', 'Instead', 'overwhelming', 'almost', 'overtly', 'serious', 'too', 'seriously', ""n't"", 'say', 'film', 'should', ""n't"", 'feel', 'serious', 'especially', 'considering', 'subject', 'matter', 'needed', 'more', 'emotional', 'complexities', 'feel', 'truly', 'grounded', 'whole.Robin', 'Williams', 'outstanding', 'film', 'shading', 'needed', 'truly', 'anchor', 'greatness']",N/A

725241,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B00007976T,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[1, 1]","Watching this movie has got to awaken some thoughts and fears of our own. How many of us, and how many times, have we wondered about the people working in the photo labs that develop our pictures?. We know they see them. What happens behind those doors where they are developing them?. Or better yet, what are they thinking when they see them?. For all we know they could be showing them to their friends. But for one family in this movie, it gets a lot worse than that. Robin Williams, in a chilling performance, plays Sy Parrish, a lonely guy who works at the photo lab in a store called SavMart. Sy is a lonely man who lives in a plain, bland, sterile world and works in it too. The only light this guy has, the only happiness, and the only key to a somewhat normal life, is thru the Yorkin family. Dad Will(Michael Vartan), Mom Nina(Connie Nielsen), and their young son. He has been taking their pictures for years. He also makes extra copies of all the pictures they bring in so he can have a copy of his very own. He lives thru them. Imagining he is a part of their life, and they of his. He has a whole wall in his apartment plastered with pictures of them he has taken over the years. He has delusions of entering their house and picturing himself in their photos. He has even started to show up at the boy's soccer matches and refering to himself as 'Uncle Sy'. After getting fired from his job, Sy heads into a horrible downward spiral. To top it off, he finds out some unsettling information about Mr. Yorkin and tries to rectify the situation. By this time, Sy has snapped. Is Sy really a bad guy?. Is he nuts?. By the time the film ends, Sy lets us in on the pain that has brought him to this point in his life. It's nothing new and most people will probably see it coming, but at least it's real and can happen and explains certain things. The ironic thing here is that the 'perfect family' he longed after, weren't really all that happy. It's hard to see or think of Sy as a bad guy. Does he need serious help?. Yes. Is he evil?. I wouldn't say so. The movie showcases that what is on the exterior, isn't always in the interior. Williams is brilliant. He makes Sy a real person. He doesn't make it a caricature or bring us to think that it's just Robin Williams being crazy. He is Sy Parrish, and he is amazing. This also breaks the saying that Williams always seems to have a beard whenever he is doing his most serious, dramatic work. Vartan and Neilsen are too plain and directionless. They seem to just be there to go thru the motions while Robin does his thing. Neither one of them really gives out anything great that would make someone like Sy want to be them or be with them. I guess it's just the thought of being in a family. The great Gary Cole also appears as Sy's boss, and former ""ER"" star Eriq LaSalle plays a detective on the trail of Sy. Did LaSalle leave ""ER"" for small, useless roles like this?. The movie is creepy and it has the right, perfect score for it as well. What's really the scariest thing about this is that this is not some monster created by Hollywood. This is real life. This could happen and it could happen to anybody. Nothing is scarier than reality. Some people might be turned off by how Sy turns towards the last part, but it was going to come sooner or later. In his mind, he was doing nothing wrong.

725243,A2YAABMT80RLYA,B00007976T,Ben Rowland,"[3, 3]","One critic wrote that ""One Hour Photo"" will ""Do for photo developing what 'Psycho' did for showers"". It is a creppy and somewhat demented film, with an amazing performance by Robin Williams, but is flawed by a script that falters towards the end of the movie.Williams plays Sy Parrish, a photo developer at a Savmart (a department store similar to ...) who takes special pride in the prints he produces. To him, developing is an underappreciated art form. His life revolves around his job, and for good reason, he has no real life to speak of outside of his work. He was never married, has no real friends or relations, and we learn very little about his past. What we know of his present situation is bleak and depressing. But Sy has taken a special liking to a suburban family, with a successful husband, a pretty wife, and a beautiful son. Domestic bliss personified. He, in his lonely state, becomes obsessed with the family, and longs for something he can never have. This pushes him to the brink of near insanity.I will not give away any more than I already have, but I will say that the ending lets down the whole movie. The movie begins as a fascinating character study, and ends as a hollywood cliche (a diet version, if you will). While the creppiness and the quality of the acting keeps ""One Hour Photo"" entertaining, you feel unsatasfied in the end. Similar to movies like ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", the characters are more interesting before the go over the edge.The movie is the perfect starring vehicle for Williams, who is proving that his move from comedy to drama in his later years is indeed a good idea. The script, while meandering at times, is smartly written and doesn't turn the movie into a Hannibal-type affair.

725244,A2F3SXHT6RBV81,B00007976T,"Betty Burks ""Betty  Burks""","[2, 8]","A nice sunrise opening is never explained, but it would make a good postcard.  We are told that 'family photos are almost always of the happy moments and show smiling faces.'  We don't take pictures of something we want to forget.In the case of a fire, after pets, people usually save their family photos.  In the early '60s, I lived in an apartment building in the historic West Hill area of Pulaski, TN, where a fire started in the walls between the floors.  A neighbor sat down placidly to look at her photo albums, which I thought strange at the time.  I was busy getting my baby and cat and run down the stairs to deposit them on another neighbor's sofa.Sy has worked in a photo developing department of a store for 20 years and it is his life.  He gives special treatment to customers he likes, sometimes a free disposable camers as a birthday gift.He is a loner who ""adopts"" the Yorkin family.  Similarly, Miss Barnes, a spinster librarian at the college where we were, had considered me and mine as her surrogate family.  It is so sad when you have no one in your life, no one who really cares.He lives vicariously through the photos he personally handled (sometimes making a copy for himself) for nine years.  He tells the waitress at a seedy restaurant where he eats alone that the child is his nephew.  He collects all kinds of old photographs of people he doesn't know.  One was a Senior High picture of a girl taken in the '50s which he pretended was of his mother.His narration at intervals throughout the movie was most informative, such as, ""I was here; I existed.  Someone cared enough about me to take my picture.""In fact, he took one of himself at the end of one of the Yorkins' roll so they would see it.  He explained that a snapshot is a hurried shot taken without deliberate aim; a hunting term.  When I take photos, I always aim with an eye for a good background and sometimes abandon the shot if the background is not what I want.Sy gets a little too personal in his comments about their lovely home when he encounters the husband in the store one day.  A fantastic tree (such as the large one which grows outside my window) is shown at the Yorkin's front door.  He ""visits"" when they are not at home and makes himself 'at home' with a beer watching t.v. and even using the bathroom.  One day they catch him there and pretend he was expected.He observes a family coming apart emotionally with lots of interpersonal and financial problems, while Sy sits alone watching the Simpsons on t.v. and looking at his wall covered with snapshots of this young family.  He shadows the family wherever they go, even sits in the bar reading Deepak Chopra's THE PATHS TO LOVE as he knows that Ms. Yorkin is also reading this book.  He quotes a passage of Chopra's Eastern philosophy:  ""The things we fear the most have already happened to us.""From his voyeurism (looking through a set of intimate photos a young girl left to be developed), he discovers the adulterous behavior of Jake's father.  As a result, he inserts them into the envelope for some rather silly snaps the child took with his 'free' camera.He has made hundreds of copies of other photos without paying and, as a result, gets fired.  I liked the scene where he sits dejectedly on a bed in the store with a Kitty pillow.  Pathologically, he withdraws and his personality changes.  He sits in a corner on the floor and smiles at the atrocious assortment of snaps Jake took which Sy developed as his last 'job.'As he leaves on his final day of work, he steals a long butcher knife.  He follows as the Yorkins retrieved the photos to observe the wife's hurt and torment when she sees the evidence of her husband's infidelity.  He even goes so far as to hide and take pictures of the family through a large picture window as they go through the normality of a meal.  The purloined revealing, sexy photos didn't have the lasting effect he'd hoped for.He is clever in his demented state as he sets out to make things right for his beloved ""adopted"" family.  He tracks the philandering husband with his mistress to a hotel and maneuvers to get a room on the same floor.  He tortures the nude couple as he photographs them in sordid situations.He has committed a criminal act previously, by taking photos of his manager's young daughter.  Gary Cole was good as the manager who had to fire him.  He was marvelous in the t.v. series AMERICAN GOTHIC.  He has invated their existence and subsequently indirectly threatened the child's life.  The police are called and discover the wall of photographs which Sy has defaced by scratching the face of the husband in each one.He is able to delude them by intervening through a conference on 'retinal implants' at the hotel and escapes through the kitchen.  He runs like the athlete he never was, down the garage ramps.  But gets caught nevertheless.  He'd left the unused knife behind in room 519 and says, ""I just took pictures.""On the surface, Jake's dad looks the same but nothing will ever be the same.  Is this man smart enough to appreciate the good he has?  Or will he continue to cheat on his wife and neglect his son.  No one will ever be the same.Sy was harmed emotionallly by some of the content of photographs he'd developed for fifteen years.  Seeing some of the things people did to their children had left lasting damage to his psyche.  He ended up with stupid photos of inanimate objects that only a crazy person would take.  The scene where his nightmare showed blood gushing from his eyes had set him on a trail of depravity.Did this move have any redeeming quality?  I didn't see any, but this is one film it will take me a long time to forget.  Sorta like PSYCHO.  I guess that stands for something in the long run of things; perhaps a lesson was learned after all.",2,Where are my pictures?,1084752000,"05 17, 2004",2004,5797,"['nice', 'sunrise', 'opening',

All that attempted understanding and ""rehibilitation"" went out the window.When you deal with a Manson or a Bin Ladin or just your garden veriaty sexual perditor, there is a lot of merit in this. These people are evil. You can't teach them  empathy.But Sy is not evil. He is just a sad, isolated man, one of those marginalized people who are so at a loss as to how to act, no one talks, or more importantly, listens to them. It is scary  how many people there are like Sy, and how callously we dismiss them. What if someone had taken the time to be really nice to this guy?Sy has had really awful things happen to him. He idealizes a family who's photos he develops, and wants to be part of this family. He is not even crazy, just very disturbed. He is like a child, and he sees this family as his embracing fantasy--fills in the blanks with his own yearnings. He does not want to harm, steal, violate or kill. His problem is he is completely incapable of conceiving of other people as intigrated and complex, becuase he is not.Sy may not be a bad man, but does a very bad thing. He finds out the father in the family is having an affair, and terrorizes the couple.\It is a good thing that Sy is caught: he is now off the street, where he can't escelate and really harm another.One Hour Photo is unique among films of our era in that it makes you feel geniune pity for the perportrator. The movie does not excuse what he did, and again, we want guys like Sy in a place seperate from the rest of us--he did the crime and needs to deal with the consequences.But Sy is also a product of consequences. No one talked to this man, threw him a rope, saw that he was going deep under and tried to do something. Had someone put an arm around him, took him for a coffee, would he have listened? I don't know, One Hour Photo shows how some people, left alone, can go from being strange to very, very sick--because no one payed attention when there was still time.That is the real creepiness of One Hour Photo.",4,excellent,1258761600,"11 21, 2009",2009,2104,"['Violent', 'crime', 'got', 'so', 'control', '1970s', 'mid', '1990s', 'people', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'why', 'anymore', 'attempted', 'understanding', 'rehibilitation', 'went', 'window.When', 'deal', 'Manson', 'Bin', 'Ladin', 'just', 'garden', 'veriaty', 'sexual', 'perditor', 'lot', 'merit', 'people', 'are', 'evil', 'ca', ""n't"", 'teach', 'empathy.But', 'Sy', 'not', 'evil', 'just', 'sad', 'isolated', 'man', 'one', 'marginalized', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'so', 'loss', 'how', 'act', 'one', 'more', 'importantly', 'scary', 'how', 'many', 'people', 'are', 'Sy', 'how', 'callously', 'dismiss', 'What', 'someone', 'had', 'taken', 'time', 'be', 'really', 'nice', 'guy', 'Sy', 'had', 'really', 'awful', 'things', 'happen', 'family', 'who', 'photos', 'be', 'part', 'family', 'not', 'even', 'crazy', 'just', 'very', 'disturbed', 'child', 'family', 'embracing', 'fantasy', 'fills', 'blanks', 'own', 'yearnings', 'not', 'want', 'harm', 'steal', 'violate', 'kill', 'problem', 'completely', 'incapable', 'conceiving', 'other', 'people', 'intigrated', 'complex', 'becuase', 'not.Sy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'man', 'very', 'bad', 'thing', 'out', 'father', 'family', 'having', 'affair', 'couple.\\It', 'good', 'thing', 'Sy', 'caught', 'now', 'street', 'where', 'ca', ""n't"", 'escelate', 'really', 'harm', 'another.One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'unique', 'films', 'era', 'feel', 'geniune', 'pity', 'perportrator', 'movie', 'not', 'excuse', 'what', 'did', 'again', 'want', 'guys', 'Sy', 'place', 'seperate', 'rest', 'did', 'crime', 'needs', 'deal', 'consequences.But', 'Sy', 'also', 'product', 'consequences', 'one', 'talked', 'man', 'threw', 'rope', 'saw', 'was', 'going', 'deep', 'tried', 'do', 'something', 'Had', 'someone', 'put', 'arm', 'took', 'coffee', 'would', 'have', 'listened', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'how', 'people', 'left', 'alone', 'can', 'go', 'being', 'strange', 'very', 'very', 'sick', 'one', 'payed', 'attention', 'when', 'was', 'still', 'time.That', 'real', 'creepiness', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo']",N/A

He works as a photo-finisher at the local Sav-mart, where he takes his job VERY seriously. For ten years now, Sy has given special attention to the Yorkin family. He's developed their film in under an hour, and even made sure to get an extra set of prints for himself. Poor Sy has no life at all. Each night he gets off work, drives his boring little car home to his dull little apartment, and watches tv. Sy has only one ray of sunshine in his otherwise gray existence. It is the Yorkin family. Over the years their pictures have become Sy's obsession. They have given him a sense of belonging and a reason to live. Sy has covered an entire wall with the Yorkin clan's photos. This collage represents their history with &quot;uncle&quot; Sy. One day, Sy gets called in to see his boss at Sav-mart. He's been busted for his decade worth of making (stealing) extra sets of pictures. Sy gets fired. What else is there for a man like Sy? While finishing out his final week, Sy runs across some pictures of Will Yorkin (head of Sy's adopted family) being romantic with another woman. Sy is outraged. His dream has been destroyed and he must face a reality he's spent a lifetime supressing. There are no perfect families. There are no perfect people. There are only human beings doing messy human things. This doesn't sit well with Sy, who sets out to teach his ex-boss and Will Yorkin a lesson in humility. Yep, the glue has dissolved, Sy's come apart, and he's on a rampage! What comes next is retribution for those who have dared to betray him. ONE HOUR PHOTO is a scary movie. It achieves a thickening atmosphere of dread without any cheap shots or unnecessary violence. Every crack in Sy's mind is tiny and subtle, until these cracks join together into one huge split.

725250,APP5MBH2BSX6I,B00007976T,"Brian Hulett ""okierazorbacker2""","[2, 2]","Indeed the name ""Robin Williams"" connected with this film should not lead one to expect any laughs.  This is as tense a film as I've seen in some time.  The director, previously best known for rock videos, creates a sensational looking world that includes a megastore that looks very much like a ""Super Target"" store, a fabulous home for a financially successful young family, and the home of our main character, Sy Parrish, played by the Julliard-trained Mr. Williams.For almost 30 years I've felt that Williams is the funniest man alive, and that his few dramatic roles have been effective.  In this film, however, even though his presence looms large in almost every scene, he has taken it up a notch, totally and believably submerging any hint of humor.  We find Sy as an unstable control freak with no real life of his own, his entire world consisting of his TV, his subcompact car, and his job as a photo tech.  Consequently he infuses every detail of his pathetic world with a tremendous amount of importance, sweating the small stuff with such vigor that he reeks of the need to psychically rehydrate.One can see the moment coming when he snaps, and woe to the family in his way.This is not a violent film, but is phenomenally suspenseful in a Hitchcockian way.  There are two or three problems of logic with the plotting, unfortunately; one must believe, for example, that an unfaithful husband would allow his girlfriend to take a full roll of photos of them together kissing various parts of one another's upper anatomy (OK, so maybe he's just an idiot as well as a loser).  It's also a one-note film, focused in with tunnelvision on Sy and his unraveling.In any event, Williams carries off his role so well that ultimately the film works well, is very memorable and effective, and is certainly worth a rental at least.  Williams fans, those who love this type of film, and we who are intrigued with abnormal psychology, may well want to own a copy.",4,Psychotic break,1115078400,"05 3, 2005",2005,1960,"['Indeed', 'name', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'connected', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'lead', 'one', 'expect', 'laughs', 'tense', 'film', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'time', 'director', 'previously', 'best', 'known', 'rock', 'videos', 'sensational', 'looking', 'world', 'megastore', 'very', 'much', 'Super', 'Target', 'store', 'fabulous', 'home', 'financially', 'successful', 'young', 'family', 'home', 'main', 'character', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'played', 'Julliard-trained', 'Mr.', 'Williams.For', 'almost', '30', 'years', ""'ve"", 'felt', 'Williams', 'funniest', 'man', 'alive', 'few', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'have', 'been', 'effective', 'film', 'however', 'even', 'presence', 'large', 'almost', 'scene', 'taken', 'up', 'notch', 'totally', 'believably', 'submerging', 'hint', 'humor', 'find', 'Sy', 'unstable', 'control', 'freak', 'real', 'life', 'own', 'entire', 'world', 'consisting', 'TV', 'subcompact', 'car', 'job', 'photo', 'tech', 'Consequently', 'detail', 'pathetic', 'world', 'tremendous', 'amount', 'importance', 'sweating', 'small', 'stuff', 'such', 'vigor', 'need', 'psychically', 'rehydrate.One', 'can', 'see', 'moment', 'coming', 'when', 'woe', 'family', 'way.This', 'not', 'violent', 'film', 'phenomenally', 'suspenseful', 'Hitchcockian', 'way', 'are', 'two', 'three', 'problems', 'logic', 'plotting', 'unfortunately', 'one', 'must', 'believe', 'example', 'unfaithful', 'husband', 'would', 'allow', 'girlfriend', 'take', 'full', 'roll', 'photos', 'together', 'kissing', 'various', 'parts', 'one', 'upper', 'anatomy', 'OK', 'so', 'maybe', 'just', 'idiot', 'as', 'well', 'loser', 'also', 'one-note', 'film', 'focused', 'tunnelvision', 'Sy', 'unraveling.In', 'event', 'Williams', 'role', 'so', 'well', 'ultimately', 'film', 'well', 'very', 'memorable', 'effective', 'certainly', 'worth', 'rental', 'least', 'Williams', 'fans', 'who', 'love', 'type', 'film', 'who', 'are', 'intrigued', 'abnormal', 'psychology', 'may', 'well', 'want', 'own', 'copy']",N/A

725252,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B00007976T,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[2, 4]","One Hour Photo is a movie where Robin Williams goes from being a funny guy in his other movies to being a creep. He plays a very lonely guy, and you would almost feel sorry for him--if he weren't so unhinged and potentially dangerous. The robot in 'Lost in Space' is waving his robot arms and screaming ""Danger, Will Robinson.""Let's take a brief retrospective of Robin's career:He is a stand up comedian in San Francisco, and in 1977 that leads to a couple of spots on ""The Richard Pryor Show,"" an appearance on ""Laugh-In,"" and ""Eight is Enough."" Next year he gets on ""America-2-Night"" and then a couple of episodes of ""Happy Days"" as Mork, a character that is so popular that it spins off into ""Mork and Mindy"" and a star is born. ""Mork and Mindy"" runs for 94 episodes. By 1980 he plays Popeye in 'Popeye' for Robert Altman, with Shelly Duvall as Olive Oyl (brilliant casting, by the way). ""Mork"" continues until 1982.It seems that Mr. Williams was very successful playing either likable, funny or funny AND likeable characters, but at some point, he wanted to explore his dark side. Thus we have 'One Hour Photo.' Also, 'Death to Smoochy,' 'License to Wed' and an episode of ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" where he plays an enigmatic criminal named Merritt Rook.His character: Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, though is probably his bleakest. There are few laughs (at least intentional ones) in 'One Hour Photo.' Robin Williams, who  spews words in his stand up act, and in such tour de forces of improvisational  'genius' as the Genie in 'Aladdin,' is very subdued and understated in 'One Hour Photo.'Just a few observations, mostly about the look of One Hour Photo, the art direction, symbols, metaphors, and so forth: Everything is bland in shopping mall land. Beige, beige, beige, as far as the eye can see. Also Seymour's apartment has a bland and antiseptic quality. Seymour is a good name for a stalker and voyeur, because he always wants to ""see more."" The shortened form of his moniker, ""Sy,"" is even better, because it brings to mind the Cyclops: One Giant Eye looking right at you, like the lens of a camera. There are a lot of visual metaphors for pictures and photography. Sometimes windows and the framing of shots all conspire to bring to mind cameras and photography. The names of the characters are often names of famous photographers, an inside joke (just as one example, his associate is named Araki just like a famous Japanese photographer).'One Hour Photo' is a very interesting film for its design ideas and its comments on loneliness and alienation in the modern world (or at least as modern as 2002) but it has a few holes in the plot and other flaws that prevent it from being more than an exercise to impress film school professors. For instance, would a couple who have just been humiliated and threatened with a knife just remain in stunned silence once their assailant had left them? Wouldn't they be on the phone in the blink of an eye, calling 911 about the maniac?If you can suspend disbelief just a little bit, you might enjoy this film for its clever design, thrills and suspense, and a performance from Robin Williams that is very different from anything he's done up to this point.""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" ....

The suspense begins when it becomes clear that Sy's whole life revolves around one of the families who has been developing film with him for the past nine or ten years. Sy  has seen years of pictures of all the best times in this family's life: birthdays, holidays, vacations, and all the happiest moments.

Some have called this a scary movie, but One Hour Photo works on emotional levels much deeper than fear and disquiet.  This is an intellectual thriller that at times borders on a work of art, a carefully constructed exploration of the depths to which loneliness and bland ordinariness can drive a man.  Everyone reacts to this movie differently; by design, a sense of moral ambiguity pervades the story and its presentation.  Many may see Sy Parrish as a bad guy (though certainly not a stereotypical one); those lucky enough to never know the hopelessness and loneliness this man endures or to experience the devastation of seeing your whole world pulled out from under your feet may look down their noses at him with denigration, not truly understanding his afflictions.  Most of us, though, know what utter loneliness feels like to some degree, and I can't help but believe that most viewers will feel a connection to Sy Parrish that differs markedly from what they might anticipate going in.  If you ask me, there is a bad guy in this film, but it is not Sy Parrish.Sy Parrish's job means everything to him; as a photo developer at a large retail store, he develops customers' pictures with great care and professionalism.  Outside of his photo development domain, he is bland and invisible, a man truly alone.  His life could not be more different from the lives he sees day by day in the pictures he develops - in the pictures of happy families, he sees everything he wants but cannot have.  Thus, it almost seems natural that he would begin to fantasize about being a part of such a life, to have a family of his own.  His favorite family is the Yorkins, a seemingly perfect young couple with one son.  Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) is one of Sy's best customers; she's always bringing in pictures to be developed.  Having watched the Yorkin family evolve over a number of years, Sy has adopted them as his own, making his own copies of all their pictures.  He knows Nina, her husband Will (Michael Vartan), and son Jake (Dylan Smith) intimately through their photos; he knows where they live, what their house is like, and all sorts of additional personal details about them.  In his own mind, he is Uncle Sy to Jake, and he tries to insinuate himself into the Yorkins' lives at just the time his own real life is beginning to fragment.  His job is no longer secure, and it is during this troubled time that he discovers that the Yorkins are not the ideal family after all.  That discovery is just more than he can take.This is not the kind of role you associate with Robin Williams, but there can be no doubt that this man is among the most accomplished of actors.  All of the natural energy Williams suppresses in his transformation to the externally calm, quiet, rather forgettable Sy Parrish lends his performance a power that few other actors could bring to such a role.  Writer and director Mark Romanek gave Williams a completely different look, and the set design and cinematography reinforces that directorial vision to lend the movie a sense of hyperreality that proves as unsettling as Sy's descent into mental disconnection.  The acting is superb all the way around, but Williams clearly steals the show with one of the most impressive performances I've seen in a long time.Topped off by a writer/director/actor commentary, a really well-made behind-the-scenes featurette, an ""Anatomy of a Scene"" Sundance Channel Featurette, and an extensive interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek on The Charlie Rose Show, One Hour Photo easily qualifies as a must-own DVD.",5,One of the most impressive intellectual thrillers in years,1093651200,"08 28, 2004",2004,3765,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'Oscar-worthy', 'performance', 'lonely', 'somewhat', 'creepy', 'wholly', 'sympathetic', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'haunting', 'compelling', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'have', 'called', 'scary', 'movie', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'emotional', 'levels', 'much', 'deeper', 'fear', 'disquiet', 'intellectual', 'thriller', 'times', 'borders', 'work', 'art', 'carefully', 'constructed', 'exploration', 'depths', 'loneliness', 'bland', 'ordinariness', 'can', 'drive', 'man', 'Everyone', 'movie', 'differently', 'design', 'sense', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'story', 'presentation', 'Many', 'may', 'see', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'bad', 'guy', 'certainly', 'not', 'stereotypical', 'one', 'lucky', 'enough', 'never', 'know', 'hopelessness', 'loneliness', 'man', 'experience', 'devastation', 'seeing', 'whole', 'world', 'pulled', 'out', 'feet', 'may', 'look', 'down', 'noses', 'denigration', 'not', 'truly', 'understanding', 'afflictions', 'Most', 'though', 'know', 'what', 'utter', 'loneliness', 'feels', 'degree', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'believe', 'most', 'viewers', 'will', 'feel', 'connection', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'differs', 'markedly', 'what', 'might', 'anticipate', 'going', 'ask', 'bad', 'guy', 'film', 'not', 'Sy', 'Parrish.Sy', 'Parrish', 'job', 'everything', 'photo', 'developer', 'large', 'retail', 'store', 'customers', 'pictures', 'great', 'care', 'professionalism', 'photo', 'development', 'domain', 'bland', 'invisible', 'man', 'truly', 'alone', 'life', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'more', 'different', 'lives', 'day', 'day', 'pictures', 'pictures', 'happy', 'families', 'everything', 'can', 'not', 'have', 'Thus', 'almost', 'natural', 'would', 'begin', 'fantasize', 'being', 'part', 'life', 'have', 'family', 'own', 'favorite', 'family', 'Yorkins', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'young', 'couple', 'one', 'son', 'Nina', 'Yorkin', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'one', 'Sy', 'best', 'customers', 'always', 'bringing', 'pictures', 'be', 'developed', 'Having', 'watched', 'Yorkin', 'family', 'evolve', 'number', 'years', 'Sy', 'adopted', 'own', 'making', 'own', 'copies', 'pictures', 'Nina', 'husband', 'Will', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'son', 'Jake', 'Dylan', 'Smith', 'intimately', 'photos', 'where', 'live', 'what', 'house', 'sorts', 'additional', 'personal', 'details', 'own', 'mind', 'Uncle', 'Sy', 'Jake', 'insinuate', 'Yorkins', 'lives', 'just', 'time', 'own', 'real', 'life', 'beginning', 'fragment', 'job', 'no', 'longer', 'secure', 'troubled', 'time', 'Yorkins', 'are', 'not', 'ideal', 'family', 'discovery', 'just', 'more', 'can', 'take.This', 'not', 'kind', 'role', 'associate', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'can', 'be', 'doubt', 'man', 'most', 'accomplished', 'actors', 'natural', 'energy', 'Williams', 'transformation', 'externally', 'calm', 'quiet', 'rather', 'forgettable', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'performance', 'power', 'few', 'other', 'actors', 'could', 'bring', 'role', 'Writer', 'director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'gave', 'Williams', 'completely', 'different', 'look', 'set', 'design', 'cinematography', 'reinforces', 'directorial', 'vision', 'lend', 'movie', 'sense', 'hyperreality', 'as', 'unsettling', 'Sy', 'descent', 'mental', 'disconnection', 'acting', 'superb', 'way', 'Williams', 'clearly', 'show', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'performances', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'long', 'time.Topped', 'off', 'writer/director/actor', 'commentary', 'really', 'well-made', 'behind-the-scenes', 'featurette', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'Featurette', 'extensive', 'interview', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'easily', 'must-own', 'DVD']",N/A

This movie will force you to generate some of your own conclusions about you've witnessed.Robin Williams gives one of his best performances to date as an appearingly mild mannered yet devious photo clerk who takes his job as a photo tech at the local &quot;Sav-Mart' a bit too serious because it appears to be all he has.His emotional pathology becomes progressively evident and alarming as he becomes increasingly 'over-involved' with a family that brings in their photos to his store for processing. Although he blatantly oversteps some major boundaries, he does so in such a way that the seriousness of his disturbance is not realized soon enough. Some of his bizarre behaviors lead your thoughts to very dark places while at the same time, the pity his character generates, makes you want to believe that maybe his motivations really aren't that pathological.Because Williams character evokes such a wide range of emotion, your own feelings towards him vaccilate.  He is devious yet likable even amidst his pervading creepiness. Although appearingly generally mild mannered and timid, he has his moments of assertiveness and later, 'over the edge' aggressiveness and righteous indignation.The cinematography and visual imagery is excellent and brilliantly contrasts the drab, washed out and somewhat color-less life of William's character to that of the vivid and vibrant family he becomes &quot;focused&quot; on.It's a good psychological thriller.

725268,A2B73CL3QSYWLB,B00007976T,David Baldwin,"[1, 1]","I'll begin my review by stating that I've never been a big Robin Williams fan, or rather, I've never liked many of his roles.  The choices he's made to a great degree tend to be on the schmaltzy side.  Giving the devil his due I will say that his work in ""One Hour Photo"" is the best I've ever seen him.  Many of the reviewers tend to label this film as a thriller.  I found it to be more of a psychological profile of an extremely lonely man who's teetering on the brink of madness.  Sy Parrish(Williams) is a man whose loneliness pushes him to pursue perfection in his chosen occupation as a photo lab technician at a mega-store.  Sy, however, has a dangerous obsession with the family of one of his customer's in that he attaches himself to them whether it be taking home extra exposures of their photographs or daydreaming about living at their home.  When Sy's misguided fantasies about this family who may be borderline dysfunctional are shattered he experiences a personal meltdown.  As I've previously stated I didn't view this film as a conventional thriller because Williams injects a degree of empathy in Sy for the audience.

725271,A2OVUDBRWGX0LL,B00007976T,David,"[0, 0]","One Hour Photo does not qualify as a horror film, but it certainly is creepy and engrossing.Robin Williams gives an outstanding performance as Sy Parrish, one of those little people in life that everyone ignores.  Parrish is photo developing technician for one of those value chain stores.  His dress is impeccable, he lives in a drab and virtually empty apartment, and drives a sensible car.  The guy really reeks of smallness and emptiness.  Through the years he has insinuated himself into the Yorkin family from afar as he has developed their photos detailing virtually every aspect of their lives.  His actions become a little more intrusive as he scouts their home and young son.  Still, his actions seem harmless enough--until one sees the hundreds of family photos Sy has pasted on one of his apartment walls in some sort of giant collage.  Only then do we suspect a sinister side of William's character.A combination of Sy being fired from his job (his boss, played by Gary Cole, finds out about hundreds of unauthorized prints being made) and his discovering, by chance, Will Yorkin's infidelity sends him over the edge.  He 'innocently' tries (and succeeds) to make Yorkin's wife aware of her husband's elicit affair but it doesn't generate the result he desires.  He then tries a more aggressive approach in the climactic scene of the movie.  Apparently, Will Yorkin shattered Sy's vision of the perfect family.  Sy is a tamer version of the Terry O'Quinn character in the first two Stepfather movies--but no less creepy.The movie is very compartmentalized, with most of its scenes either in the store where Sy works, his apartment, or the Yorkin home.  It's the scenes in the apartment where we truly see the emptiness of the man's life.

Here, Williams' cinematic performance is worth many a rave review, and clearly puts him in the spotlight, up close and personal as Sy &quot;the one hour photo guy&quot;. We look in on our study in action, working as a lab photo technician at a Wal-Mart-type knockoff. While developing many a photograph, one particular family catches Sy's eye, as well as his personal camera lens, as Sy's job becomes his personal obsession, an obsession that could wind up going too far if Sy isn't careful. In fact, this job means everything to our photography expert, as this storyline is conveyed clearly to the viewer. As the film progresses, the story itself becomes more intense, with the action becoming even more developmental with each passing scene. But, Robin Williams, whose performance here is nothing short of breathtakingly spectacular, isn't the only star whose performance shouldn't go unnoticed. Kudos should also go to Gary Cole, whose performance as a superstore manager and Sy's boss, although somewhat brief, is also worthy of high marks, especially in the intensity dept.. Cole's character is the absolutely perfect opposite foil of Williams' character, where the latter exhibits a Type B personality as opposed to Cole's Type A demeanor. With so many hooks to keep the frequent moviegoer (and regular video purchaser) entertained, and with its star and supporting cast's performances to boot (including Eriq La Salle's [of &quot;ER&quot; and &quot;Coming To America&quot; fame] credible role as a police detective), &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; just might earn Robin Williams the Best Actor Oscar of 2002.

The great philosopher instead advocated I-Thou relationships between ourselves and those who interact with us even in minor ways.  Nonetheless, Buber might have changed his mind had he ever met Sy Parrish (Robin Williams).  The one hour photo technician desires far more intimacy with his customers than is psychologically healthy and normally desirable.  Sy is a loser who bewilderingly is content earning a mediocre income as a store clerk/film developer for a large discount chain store.  He looks upon this pathetic job as a serious vocation instead of one barely paying a few cents above minimum wage.  The only fault I could find in this great five star film is the portrayal of Sy as somebody able to afford a nice car, live in a fairly large apartment, and eat out on a regular basis.  This is totally absurd.  In the real world a Sy would barely be able to pay for a cramped efficiency apartment and a beat up older automobile.Sy focuses his unwanted attention onto the affluent and outwardly happy Yorkin family.  The young couple and their nine year old son have no idea that Sy's world revolves around their own lives.  We are sometimes tempted to turn our heads away from the screen while observing Sy embarrassingly making a fool of himself.  Robin Williams is uncannily brilliant as a warped human being with nothing going for himself.  And yes, Williams will almost certainly garner an Academy Award nomination for his brilliant interpretation of Sy.  Williams' recent work in Insomnia as similarly a creepy weirdo may also earn him a supporting role nomination.  Is it possible that Williams' earlier comedic roles will soon be forgotten?

Its the kind of family he was to be part of.But things turn sour when he finds out Mr. Yorkin is having an affair. He finds this out from the mistress who had their pictures developed at the photo shop where Sy works.The conflict here becomes apparent. Sy becomes disturbed. Why do people only take photos only of happy moments and hide the sad moments to themselves? After seeing happy photos of the Yorkins then later finds out that they're not so perfect at all, and his illusions shattered, he vents out his anger on the unsuspecting family.This is the kind of psychological and emotional conflict you'll find in this movie.

725276,A3QEJ40NQEW36Q,B00007976T,"Desired FX ""Call me Don. It's shorter than Is...","[0, 0]","Robin Williams is the doorway into this movie: it's his performance that makes the whole thing possible. But underneath his brilliant portrayal is a structure that doesn't quite work.My primary objection to ONE HOUR PHOTO is the artsy flavor it was given by writer-director Mark Romanek. For example, the pristine white of the SavMart is unheard of in the real world: these are the bargain basement stores--they're never this well-stocked or well-kept. What that does is change how the viewer relates to the story: it doesn't take place in the store down the street--it takes place in some fantasy world where perfection is the norm.Given Sy's black-and-white view of the world, the perfect backdrop could depict more his perception than the reality--his wish for what his world should be--but it never really feels like that. Sy is not a guy in his own world who is trying to understand why things aren't better for him--Sy is a guy who wants to live in the world of the photos he develops. He doesn't see a perfect world he doesn't fit into: he sees the photos as a window on the perfect world he wants desperately to be a part of. Perhaps the excessive sterility of the SavMart is supposed to feel unreal and oppressive to him to the point where he needs to escape it, but overall the look-and-feel of the settings seem to clash with where the story is coming from and what it's trying to achieve.Even so, Romanek has given us a profoundly disturbing look at the world we live in and asked us all to define for ourselves what right and wrong really are. Is Sy's behavior more &quot;wrong&quot; than Will's?Williams portrays Sy as a disturbed, alienated man who is just trying to find a place where he belongs, and his astonishing performance is the centerpiece of the film (he's in almost every scene). That his angst and struggle is as familiar and poignant as it is disturbing underscores Romanek's questions about our world. Sy could be any person you pass on the street, and his obsession, while extreme, is both morally correct and, ultimately, harmless.Romanek and Williams are asking us to look at the familiar strangers in our world and wonder if the boundaries around our proper societal roles aren't preventing us from noticing and understanding a troubled soul...a struggling comrade...a good, loyal, gentle friend. He's further warning us that following the boundaries and ignoring the people who are reaching out to us could ultimately be a lot more dangerous than taking a chance and letting them in.",4,A near miss.,1046908800,"03 6, 2003",2003,2517,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'doorway', 'movie', 'performance', 'whole', 'thing', 'possible', 'brilliant', 'portrayal', 'structure', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work.My', 'primary', 'objection', 'ONE', 'HOUR', 'PHOTO', 'artsy', 'flavor', 'was', 'given', 'writer-director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'example', 'pristine', 'white', 'SavMart', 'unheard', 'real', 'world', 'are', 'bargain', 'basement', 'stores', ""'re"", 'never', 'well-stocked', 'well-kept', 'What', 'change', 'how', 'viewer', 'story', ""n't"", 'take', 'place', 'store', 'down', 'street', 'place', 'fantasy', 'world', 'where', 'perfection', 'norm.Given', 'Sy', 'black-and-white', 'view', 'world', 'perfect', 'backdrop', 'could', 'depict', 'more', 'perception', 'reality', 'wish', 'what', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'never', 'really', 'feels', 'Sy', 'not', 'guy', 'own', 'world', 'who', 'trying', 'understand', 'why', 'things', 'are', ""n't"", 'better', 'Sy', 'guy', 'who', 'live', 'world', 'photos', ""n't"", 'see', 'perfect', 'world', ""n't"", 'fit', 'photos', 'window', 'perfect', 'world', 'desperately', 'be', 'part', 'Perhaps', 'excessive', 'sterility', 'SavMart', 'supposed', 'feel', 'unreal', 'oppressive', 'point', 'where', 'escape', 'look-and-feel', 'settings', 'seem', 'clash', 'where', 'story', 'coming', 'what', 'trying', 'achieve.Even', 'so', 'Romanek', 'given', 'profoundly', 'disturbing', 'look', 'world', 'live', 'asked', 'define', 'what', 'right', 'wrong', 'really', 'are', 'Is', 'Sy', 'behavior', 'more', 'quot', 'wrong', 'quot', 'Will', 'Williams', 'Sy', 'disturbed', 'alienated', 'man', 'who', 'just', 'trying', 'find', 'place', 'where', 'astonishing', 'performance', 'centerpiece', 'film', 'almost', 'scene', 'angst', 'struggle', 'familiar', 'poignant', 'disturbing', 'underscores', 'Romanek', 'questions', 'world', 'Sy', 'could', 'be', 'person', 'pass', 'street', 'obsession', 'extreme', 'morally', 'correct', 'ultimately', 'harmless.Romanek', 'Williams', 'are', 'asking', 'look', 'familiar', 'strangers', 'world', 'wonder', 'boundaries', 'proper', 'societal', 'roles', 'are', ""n't"", 'preventing', 'noticing', 'understanding', 'troubled', 'soul', 'struggling', 'comrade', 'good', 'loyal', 'gentle', 'friend', 'further', 'warning', 'following', 'boundaries', 'ignoring', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'reaching', 'out', 'could', 'ultimately', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'dangerous', 'taking', 'chance', 'letting']",N/A
725277,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,B00007976T,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[7, 8]","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.  Even so,I subtracted a star from the otherwise perfect rating simply because something about the movie didn't work.  Not that the plot, style, characterizations and overall visual presentation of the film was not well constructed and in-sync.  It wasn't that... it was the audience.  We are just too well-primed to accept the strange as, well, almost acceptable.In portraying Sy Parrish,Robin Williams takes his deranged writer role in 'Insomnia' up a notch.  At first, Sy seems the typically harmless guy with the best of intentions and one or two loose screws.  He's lonely: no friends, no family. His job seems to be all important to him,and he performs well but, in actuality the job is just a means to an end.  By perfectly processing the film rolls handed over to him at the local discount department store, Sy becomes a voyeur without ever leaving the confines of the world of his apartment and the store. In particular, he has zeroed in on the Yorkin family: Nina, Will and their young son.  To him,they have a model existence,one where Sy envisions himself as an involved ""uncle"", albeit to the extreme especially when he discovers that Will is having an affair with another photo client. Sy's loose screws drop out of his head as his picture of perfection is trampled and he devises a method of 'helping' the situation in a way that leaves the moviegoer's imagination stinging with bizarre possibilities that I will not disclose.All this makes for an enthralling panorama of suburbian life that mesmerizes but nevertheless misses a beat somewhere in the process.  I think as 21st century film critics we have become just a little too anesthesized to strangeness as portrayed on the silver screen.  We have seen it all, haven't we?  Hannibal Lecter scared the daylights out of us with his slithering tongue and psychological slashing of Jodi Foster in 'The Silence of the Lambs', yet in 'Hannibal', a more gruesome act of eating Ray Liotta's still thinking brain had somewhat of a lesser impact. We have been 'privledged' to see multiple-personalities, child molestors, sexual deviants, serial killers and the all purpose cannibal---hey, we all love the Sopranos---so as creepy as Robin William's portrayal of Sy Parrish should be to our moral and ethical sensibilities, it is somehow diminished by our own sophistication as curried from the virtual world of films. Sy just doesn't provide the 'punch' needed to overthrow Hannibal from the current 'King Weirdo' throne. Visually, the director provides only a hint of what Sy's punishment for Will actually is---and this is the one moment of the film that lifts the hair off the back of the neck---ironically what WE DON""T SEE is more bizarre than what is shown in full technicolor.Nonetheless,'One Hour Photo' is still a good film in spite of our jaded viewpoints. Connie Nielson ('Gladiator') is chic yet vulnerable as the suburban wife and mother and Michael Vartan ('Mists of Avalon')is sufficently sexy and thoroughly ashamed as the straying husband and father. While the sterile whiteness of the ubiquitously offensive suburban superstore and that of William's apartment in the film suggests Sy's toxic need for order in an otherwise unordered situation contrasts well with the picture perfect environs of the Yorkin family's phony Utopian dream.

From inane slapstick to skin-crawling revulsion, I gotta hand it to you, Mork:  you're showing some range in your golden years.  And ONE HOUR PHOTO successfully pegs the &quot;Goose Bumps&quot; meter, similar to finding a worm in your cupcake or going to church not knowing your fly is unzipped.  Shudder.Photo developer Sy Parrish (Mork, er, Robin Williams) is the quintessential human ticking time bomb.  Lonely, depressed, insecure, he has no life other than his job at SavMart and his obsession with a yuppie family--an obsession that literally covers a wall of his shabby apartment with photographs of the handsome couple and their young son.  Sy wishes--initially--no harm on the family; he merely longs to be a part of their lives, to be embraced as &quot;Uncle Sy.&quot;  But his obsession, alas, cannot translate into reality, and when Sy suffers a career setback and then discovers a flaw in his beloved family, the mental choo-choo derails in a hurry.  The ending is atypical of psycho thrillers, and pushes Williams' disturbed character even more into the forefront.The scrumptious Connie Nielsen is dynamite as Nina Yorkin, the unsuspecting victim of Sy's dysfunctional stalking; director Mark Romanek moves the story along with all the eery discomfort of scraping fingernails across a blackboard.

I was priveleged to see him perform live once and had an opportunity to meet him at a reception after the performance. He is as funny in person as he is on the screen and meeting him was a real thrill.I have followed his career closely and have seen every movie that he has been in. Sometimes I am disappointed in his choice of film and don't feel that he has had the opportunities that he should have to really shine in some of these performances. However, ""One Hour Photo"" is an exception. Robin is outstanding in this film. And I call this a film, rather than a movie because I feel that it deserves recognition as a work of art, rather than an entertainment vehicle. Robin Williams disappears into the character of Sy Parrish. With his hair cut short and his eyes concealed by aviator style, outdated glasses, that manic character we all love is gone. Sy comes alive and while we watch his calm exterior, we know that underneath is a churning caldroun of anger, fear, resentment and jealousy. He is truly superb.The conclusion of this film is stunning in that it is unpredictable. We expect murder, everything seems to be leading up to that. Instead, Sy ""rapes"" the characters with his camera and humiliates an erring husband so harshly the viewer can almost empathize with him. It is a masterful twist to a storyline which continues to build in tension up to the last frame. I loved it.I hope that Robin Williams will continue to develop as a character actor. I was impressed with his versatility in ""One Hour Photo,"" and think that he may be on the right track. Let's face it, he's been in some real stinkers.

Day after day he stands behind the one-hour photo counter in its sterile atmosphere. After work he goes home. He lives alone and, as far as we can tell, has no social life. He is a thoroughly lonely man. As a photo developer he has access to the pictures of countless people, including the Yorkins. Nina and her son Jake frequently bring their family photos to be developed, which gives Sy a glimpse into the life of this apparently happy family consisting of father (Will), mother, and one son. Jake takes to calling Sy, ""Sy the Photo Guy.""Over time, what is at first a mild interest in the Yorkins becomes an obsession, driven by a desire to be part of the family. Sy begins making duplicates of all the Yorkins' prints. He then takes them home and tacks them up on a wall in his house. Soon the wall is covered with these prints. It doesn't stop there. At one point we see Sy parked in his car outside the upscale Yorkin house, fantasizing about what it would be like to be included in the day-to-day activities of the family. He begins to think of himself as Uncle Sy.Then Will, the father, has an affair. It happens that the woman he's seeing comes in to have photos developed that include pictures of her and Will. Sy immediately realizes what's going on. Indignant that Will would do something like this to destroy this apparently perfect family, Sy takes matters into his own hands.""One Hour Photo"" is an extremely well-directed, fast-moving film with no unnecessary filler.

Sy is the main character in the movie One Hour Photo which is one of the greatest thrillers in this time period.I recently rented One Hour Photo after months and months of waiting for it to come on video. The only flaw with this movie is that it felt like it was 96 seconds long. In reality the movie is 96 minutes long. After seeing it on video I decided that I really wanted to see it again. Therefore I bought it and watched it again today. It felt as if the movie got better the second time I saw it. Well mabey not better. The word that I should have used was &quot;still excellant.&quot; It didn't have the element of surprise when I watched it today but it was still great.The thing that makes the movie what it is is the premise. It has a fantastic orignal storyline. People have stalked people and became obbessed with people from seeing them and talking to them. Nobody ever thought about the people who find out things about other people's lives through there picture. What a fantastic element of thriller Mark Romanek(the writer and director of One Hour Photo) thought up with.Lighting gave the mood of the movie. The lighting was also always different with diffeent kinds of sets. When you saw the photo lab it was very white, when you saw Sy's fantasies about the family he loves it is colorful and happy. When you see the reality of the family it is a little bit colorful but also a little dark. When you saw what Sy did towards the end it was extremly dark.The score was the last thing that the crew of the movie did that wowed me. The music was perfect to this type of movie. Those of you who have seen the movie might know about the music being played when Sy is running in the hotel. It was just fantastic and pretty soon I saw myself humming the theme of that music.Finally the plot. I have talked about everything that has been showen in the movie except the plot. The film opens with Sy(Robin Williams) caught. I never approved of flashback stories...especially in a thriller. In this movie you know that Sy gets caught by the police in the end. That is a minor flaw that all movies that do that have. Sy starts his story with the Yorkins. Nina Yorkin(Commie Nielson) loves taking picture of her son Jake(Dylan Smith) and her husband Will(Michael Vartan). She gets them devopled at the local Savmart where Yoshi and his co worker Sy work. Sy have developed the Yorkins picture since Jake was a baby and eventually thinks that he is part of the family or &quot;Uncle Sy&quot; Nina and Jake like Sy but not as much as Sy likes them. Sy thinks that the Yorkins are the perfect family but he doesn't know that Nina and Will fight about money issues and Jake hears them fighint. Sy thinks of Jake as his nephew and gives him a free disponisble camera for his birthday which just pasts. Nina doesn't know the dedication that Sy puts into the family's photo's more then anyone eles's.But with his contact with the family in the store(at the lab and in the store's isle's when Will goes shopping there)the store's manenger Bill Owens(Gary Cole) becomes increasly concerned with Sy. Bill lays Sy off which is the first thing that gets Sy angry. The raging point of Sy is when he finds out that Will is having an affair with Maya Burson(Erin Daniels). Not to ruin anything in between that and the eventual involment with police detective James Van Der Zee(played fantasticly by Eriq La Salle)Hopefully you have notices that this is a great movie by reading my plot and my reveiw.

You can't help feeling for the guy, no matter how creepy and abject he is; there were many points when I just had to look away from the screen because I felt so sorry for him, more so than watching a million survivors of your run-of-the-mill wars, natural disasters, violence, etc.The other actors are also well cast, from the hard-nosed Walmart boss, to the supposedly perfect family that Sy idolizes.This is a subtle film, with striking visuals that keep your attention but avoid too much flash and sensationalism.  (Surprising, given that the director used to do music videos.)  Even though I correctly guessed the basic plot during the first 5 minutes, it still takes some unexpected twists at the end, surprisingly controlled and un-cliched twists---for example, though Sy arms himself with a six inch knife he actually doesn't use it to slice up his victims into several dozen little pieces as a more typical Hollywood melodrama would probably have him do.  This film admirably doesn't take the easy way out...it's not a simplistic portrayal of a simplistic loner-psychopath, nor a simplistic expose of a Yuppy family that's not anywhere as idyllic as it looks.The brilliance of this film is how ambiguous its main characters are, how it blurs the lines between one troubled man's delusion-life and the delusional lives most of us lead.  There are vast and fascinating subtexts here which are implied but not spoonfed; consequently this is a film that definitely stays with you...one of the best I've seen in years!",5,"Brilliant, though sometimes hard to watch",1047686400,"03 15, 2003",2003,1681,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'magnificent', 'job', 'pitiful', 'scary', 'still', 'poignant', 'Sy', 'Photo', 'Guy', 'study', 'total', 'loneliness', 'isolation', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feeling', 'guy', 'matter', 'how', 'creepy', 'abject', 'were', 'many', 'points', 'when', 'just', 'had', 'look', 'away', 'screen', 'felt', 'so', 'sorry', 'more', 'so', 'watching', 'million', 'survivors', 'run-of-the-mill', 'wars', 'natural', 'disasters', 'violence', 'other', 'actors', 'are', 'also', 'well', 'cast', 'hard-nosed', 'Walmart', 'boss', 'supposedly', 'perfect', 'family', 'Sy', 'idolizes.This', 'subtle', 'film', 'striking', 'visuals', 'keep', 'attention', 'avoid', 'too', 'much', 'flash', 'sensationalism', 'Surprising', 'given', 'director', 'used', 'do', 'music', 'videos', 'Even', 'correctly', 'guessed', 'basic', 'plot', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'still', 'unexpected', 'twists', 'end', 'surprisingly', 'controlled', 'un-cliched', 'twists', '-for', 'example', 'Sy', 'arms', 'six', 'inch', 'knife', 'actually', ""n't"", 'use', 'slice', 'up', 'victims', 'several', 'dozen', 'little', 'pieces', 'more', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'melodrama', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'do', 'film', 'admirably', ""n't"", 'take', 'easy', 'way', 'not', 'simplistic', 'portrayal', 'simplistic', 'loner-psychopath', 'simplistic', 'expose', 'Yuppy', 'family', 'not', 'anywhere', 'as', 'idyllic', 'brilliance', 'film', 'how', 'ambiguous', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'how', 'lines', 'one', 'troubled', 'man', 'delusion-life', 'delusional', 'most', 'lead', 'are', 'vast', 'fascinating', 'subtexts', 'here', 'are', 'implied', 'not', 'spoonfed', 'consequently', 'film', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'years']",N/A

725287,A34GZPHWYPSY2T,B00007976T,"E. Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[3, 7]","ONE HOUR PHOTO (Writ./Dir. Mark Romanek, 2002, 90 minutes) ~This interesting and rather ahead-of-its-time Robin Williams vehicle might have been much, much more than its minimalist bleakness presents. Funniest thing is, I only just saw it for the first time and mostly it made me miss cameras that used film. I also miss my one-hour photo developer who had a knack for my black-and-white pics.Here Williams plays Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish, a SavMart (goofy art-installation rip-off of Wal~Mart) one-hour photo developer with a keen sense of voyeurism. (Proof of the bids to save Williams' career at this point: there were leaks that the role had been offered to Jack Nicholson. Yeah, right.) One feels for Sy at all times, since he seems happiest staring at happy family photos. He has something of a sense of humor for the racy photos of the local young pervert; he beams at the children and smiling faces of stable-looking families.The wonderful, low-key soundtrack (originally done by Nine Inch Nails only to be rejected), brightly lit scenes and significance of names and numbers in this film inspired countless films to follow. In truth the only predictable thing about this movie is that it will have twists and turns since Williams relishes that sort of work.The reason Williams' performance has been stupidly called ""chilling"" ever since this film was first hyped is a phenomenon that escapes me. Yes, Seymour is a damaged and sad person, but one intuits that he wants to fix the world in some weird way. To have the world be exactly as it is in photos. We do not tend to stare at photos of child abuse, nursing homes or other horrors. We look at the glad times--and Sy wants that gladness, the orderly, gleeful joy he KNOWS is THE RIGHT THING.In an extremely autistic way, Sy has meltdowns when things do not go as happily as he wants--but it is this near-Messianic complex that makes him so interesting.As Seymour becomes revoltingly fixated with a family whose photos he's been developing for years, things get suspenseful but not much. The real suspense, I am guessing, is everyone wondering what sort of maniac Seymour might turn out to be in reality. Well, I'm not spoiling any more. All I will add is this is one of those films you will either get or you won't--love it or hate it. Or not care. Williams acts to perfection here, bringing some of the zestful skill when he played a colleague of mine, Dr. Oliver Sacks inAwakenings(character redubbed Malcolm Sayer).Williams has played another acquaintance of mine, Dr. Hunter ""Patch"" Adams in the shocking and 100% inaccuratePatch Adams - Collector's Edition. I say this because Williams' film career has seemed more down than up in the last 20 years, and actually I miss him. Williams was the Johnny Depp of my generation. So PHOTO in my opinion marks the downfall of Williams on the silver screen, though one cannot say exactly why that is. His roles after that seemed to be those of a 3rd-rate bit-player lucky to find work.The Final Cutwas a sort of great Canadian comeback for Williams, but he got lost in a film similar to this before, and it just did not work for him. People began saying Williams was miscast no matter what role he was given. That, poor friends, is the signal to head for the exit double-time. What I always admired about Williams is that he never gives up, never folds, and never struts too proudly about what he does. How he was before his downfall I do not know, but I have friends who have met him many times who say he's the meanest star they have ever met.What I do know is this thing opened on 6 screens and took in less than $350,000 opening gross. That is amazing and angering proof that the U.S. has lost interest in all things interesting, therefore there is nothing interesting about the U.S. anymore. This film grossed more than double our figure in Australia, where it opened before it did here.Do get this and watch it for its painful lessons and to see one of Williams' last truly great performances before sliding into a life of silly bit-playing and cartoon voices.",3,One-and-a-half hour minimalism,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",2014,4067,"['ONE', 'HOUR', 'PHOTO', 'Writ./Dir', 'Mark', 'Romanek', '2002', '90', 'minutes', '~This', 'interesting', 'rather', 'ahead-of-its-time', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'vehicle', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'minimalist', 'bleakness', 'presents', 'Funniest', 'thing', 'only', 'just', 'saw', 'first', 'time', 'mostly', 'made', 'miss', 'cameras', 'used', 'film', 'also', 'miss', 'one-hour', 'photo', 'developer', 'who', 'had', 'knack', 'black-and-white', 'pics.Here', 'Williams', 'Seymour', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'SavMart', 'goofy', 'art-installation', 'rip-off', 'Wal~Mart', 'one-hour', 'photo', 'developer', 'keen', 'sense', 'voyeurism', 'Proof', 'bids', 'save', 'Williams', 'career', 'point', 'were', 'leaks', 'role', 'had', 'been', 'offered', 'Jack', 'Nicholson', 'Yeah', 'right', 'One', 'feels', 'Sy', 'times', 'happiest', 'staring', 'happy', 'family', 'photos', 'something', 'sense', 'humor', 'racy', 'photos', 'local', 'young', 'pervert', 'children', 'smiling', 'stable-looking', 'families.The', 'wonderful', 'low-key', 'soundtrack', 'originally', 'done', 'Nine', 'Inch', 'Nails', 'only', 'be', 'rejected', 'brightly', 'lit', 'scenes', 'significance', 'names', 'numbers', 'film', 'inspired', 'countless', 'films', 'follow', 'truth', 'only', 'predictable', 'thing', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'twists', 'turns', 'Williams', 'sort', 'work.The', 'reason', 'Williams', 'performance', 'been', 'stupidly', 'called', 'chilling', 'ever', 'film', 'was', 'first', 'hyped', 'phenomenon', 'Yes', 'Seymour', 'damaged', 'sad', 'person', 'one', 'fix', 'world', 'weird', 'way', 'have', 'world', 'be', 'exactly', 'photos', 'do', 'not', 'tend', 'stare', 'photos', 'child', 'abuse', 'nursing', 'homes', 'other', 'horrors', 'look', 'glad', 'times', 'Sy', 'gladness', 'orderly', 'gleeful', 'joy', 'KNOWS', 'THE', 'RIGHT', 'THING.In', 'extremely', 'autistic', 'way', 'Sy', 'meltdowns', 'when', 'things', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'as', 'happily', 'near-Messianic', 'complex', 'so', 'interesting.As', 'Seymour', 'revoltingly', 'fixated', 'family', 'photos', 'been', 'developing', 'years', 'things', 'get', 'suspenseful', 'not', 'much', 'real', 'suspense', 'am', 'guessing', 'everyone', 'wondering', 'what', 'sort', 'maniac', 'Seymour', 'might', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'reality', 'Well', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'more', 'will', 'add', 'one', 'films', 'will', 'either', 'get', 'wo', ""n't"", 'love', 'hate', 'not', 'care', 'Williams', 'perfection', 'here', 'bringing', 'zestful', 'skill', 'when', 'played', 'colleague', 'mine', 'Dr.', 'Oliver', 'Sacks', 'inAwakenings', 'character', 'redubbed', 'Malcolm', 'Sayer', '.Williams', 'played', 'acquaintance', 'mine', 'Dr.', 'Hunter', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'shocking', '100', '%', 'inaccuratePatch', 'Adams', 'Collector', 'Edition', 'say', 'Williams', 'film', 'career', 'seemed', 'more', 'down', 'up', 'last', '20', 'years', 'actually', 'miss', 'Williams', 'was', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'generation', 'So', 'PHOTO', 'opinion', 'downfall', 'Williams', 'silver', 'screen', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'exactly', 'why', 'roles', 'seemed', 'be', '3rd-rate', 'bit-player', 'lucky', 'find', 'work.The', 'Final', 'Cutwas', 'sort', 'great', 'Canadian', 'comeback', 'Williams', 'got', 'lost', 'film', 'similar', 'before', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'People', 'began', 'saying', 'Williams', 'was', 'miscast', 'matter', 'what', 'role', 'was', 'given', 'poor', 'friends', 'signal', 'head', 'exit', 'double-time', 'What', 'always', 'admired', 'Williams', 'never', 'up', 'never', 'folds', 'never', 'struts', 'too', 'proudly', 'what', 'How', 'was', 'downfall', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'have', 'friends', 'who', 'have', 'met', 'many', 'times', 'who', 'say', 'meanest', 'star', 'have', 'ever', 'met.What', 'do', 'know', 'thing', 'opened', '6', 'screens', 'took', 'less', '350,000', 'opening', 'gross', 'amazing', 'angering', 'proof', 'U.S.', 'lost', 'interest', 'things', 'interesting', 'therefore', 'nothing', 'interesting', 'U.S.', 'anymore', 'film', 'grossed', 'more', 'double', 'figure', 'Australia', 'where', 'opened', 'did', 'here.Do', 'get', 'watch', 'painful', 'lessons', 'see', 'one', 'Williams', 'last', 'truly', 'great', 'performances', 'sliding', 'life', 'silly', 'bit-playing', 'cartoon', 'voices']",N/A

725290,A1FMJJKSVQDDQ,B00007976T,Eric S. Kim,"[0, 0]","It's rare to see a family in a photograph that is full of sorrow and despair. Most of the time, it's a requirement to have smiling faces in a family picture. Nobody wants to see any sort of sad expression on a face, because that's not what people would want to remember when it's revisited. It's the exact opposite of the news: we want FOND memories of life. And sometimes when we look at a smiling family in a Kodak picture, we wish we had that sort of happiness in the past (and in the present). It may seem odd to some people, but never to the main character of ""One Hour Photo"": Sy Parrish.In the film, Sy (played by Robin Williams) is one of those people that we never really notice everyday. He works at a clinic in a department store, and he seems to be nothing but air. Very few people care about him (mainly his customers).  He's neither a celebrity nor a messiah. People would pass him by and would always be oblivious of his presence, and it's only because they've got other things in mind. As a matter of fact, he would actually blend in the white and gray walls due to the dull colors of his clothing. Sy doesn't look like he acknowledges his mediocre existence, but it's clear that he cares about his work. He is fully dedicated to creating photos, but it's unfortunate that his line of work offers him nothing in return. He is not married, and he has very little friends (probably none). Whenever he heads home from work, all he does is feed his pet hamster and watch television. His life is devastatingly empty, and he just wants the world to see that he existed. Something does give him happiness, though. There is a customer named Nina Yorkin (played by Connie Nielsen) who brings in family photos, and Sy happily process them. She is his favorite customer, and therefore, her photos are the ones that he admires the most. In fact, he loves them so much that they have actually become a part of his life. The smiles and the various colorful images on these photos make him happy, because this looks like the one thing that was missing his entire life: a perfect family. He has the desire to become a part of the ""supposed"" picture-perfect family that's embedded on hand-sized pieces of paper, and he'll do anything to make sure that it this happiness stays within, even if it results in severe consequences.Director Mark Romanek has done a splendid job with ""One Hour Photo."" He and Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer, have made the correct look of the film: the contrasts of light and color between Sy's apartment, the department store, and the Yorkins' home are very well-done. Romanek has also formed the appropriate pacing for this movie: nothing is ever too slow or too rushed. Credit should also go to Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek for the chilling yet beautiful music score. Actually, credit should go to everyone who was involved with this film.Robin Williams is mostly known for his comedic work. I don't admire a majority of the films that he appeared in, but I admire him for his abstract comic timings and improvisations. His dramatic work, however, has surprised millions of people because this is the exact opposite of what he has been associated with. I'm not particularly shocked by this change of pace, but I was deeply fascinated by not only his character, but also his performance in the film. Robin has that quiet, awkward personality down perfectly for his character, and his complete absorption of Sy Parrish's mannerisms and dialogue is really a mesmerizing sight to see. The supporting cast does a very good job as well. Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith were very appropriate as the Yorkins, while Gary Cole plays Bill Owens, the store manager, with very few flaws.""One Hour Photo"" is not a feel-good film, nor is it trying to be one. It succeeds at being a psychological thriller/drama that delves into solemn real-world issues. It's depressing, but it's also powerful.

This obsession is the one that makes him the bad guy. But I'd have to stop at that.The key actors here are Robin Williams and Connie Nielsen.  While I do understand that Robin Williams is trying to get out of his comedy act stereotype (which a lot of actors try to do anyway), this is quite a good attempt.The films itself is a whole flashback story, because from the very beginning, we already know that Sy has been captured by the law.

725293,A1X12F0KC8GY6M,B00007976T,FLbeachbum,"[3, 3]","I recently viewed ""One Hour Photo"" quite by accident, and was stunned to discover that it's a very different and far better movie than I expected. (When it was first released several years ago, the title alone was enough to make me dismiss it as probable sleaze.)I have always respected Robin Williams' talent as a dramatic actor, as opposed to his comic/manic persona, which has never done anything but irritate me. Judging by other Amazon reviews, however, many people feel the opposite; hence, they too were misled by ""One Hour Photo"", but in a different way. I'm afraid this contributed to the less-than-sterling box office returns, and I sincerely hope that writer/director Mark Romanek is not discouraged by this as his full-length feature debut. The movie is not flawless (is anything?), but I am greatly impressed by the quality of it, and Mr. Romanek's demeanor and discussions featured as extras on the DVD confirm an intelligence, maturity, and professionalism far surpassing many other young directors. I do wish, however, that Mr. Williams had refrained from so much mania on the ""Charlie Rose"" segment, because it was too distracting and diminished Mr. Romanek's opportunity to shine. Fortunately though, throughout the ""Commentary"" portion of the DVD, Williams exercises the proper restraint and allows Mr. Romanek to lead the way.Not to mention Robin Williams' stellar performance throughout the movie itself. Here he plays the role of Sy Parrish, a withdrawn and introverted photo clerk in a Walmart-type store. Over the years he has come to feel as though he's a part of the Yorkin family, since he has been conscientiously developing their family photos meanwhile. He has fueled this fantasy as ""Uncle Sy"" by keeping an extra copy of the Yorkin prints for himself and displaying them on one wall of his apartment. However, the boss's detection of missing prints leads to Sy's dismissal, and this combined with Sy's discovery that the Yorkin family do not live up to his ideals is enough to push his fragile psyche over the edge.Don't expect me to provide any spoilers; what I will say is that ""One Hour Photo"" is something of a subjective experience which can lead to many interpretations and thought-provoking discussions.

Those of you who know him as Mork, Mrs. Doubtfire and Patch Adams will be pleasantly surprised by his ability to play the role of a lonely, creepy stalker in One Hour Photo.  There are many creative elements worth seeing, too.  The set design and the music both contribute to the isolation felt by the main character and felt also by Nina, her son and her husband.  The reason I give the movie only four stars is that I think there is lack of character development with Sy.  We don't get much information about his past until the end.  His character would be more sympathetic if we were given some insight into how he became such a loner and an oddball earlier on in the story.  This could have been accomplished easily via flashbacks.  This would've taken up a few mere minutes of film, so I don't know why it wasn't done.  Still, this movie is well-worth seeing.  As an added note, I am writing this review in 2011.  The movie came out before the film camera had gone the way of the dodo.

I thought, how could Robin Williams, the always-smiling man who played the ever-go-lucky, lovable and happy ""Mork"", portray a depressed,lonely, obsessive and psychotic photo developer? Easy, he did a superb job, and I was surprised and disappointed that he did not get more recogniton for his work in this movie.""Sy"" is the knowledgeable and skilled photo finisher at the local ""Sav-Mart"", which we all know of course, is Wal-Mart. Sy, a chronic loner, is enthralled with a young, and successful local couple and their bright and happy boy. Sy seems to know every intricate detail of their lives as a result of processing their photos for a number of years, which eventually evolves into a sick, morbid obsession. Sy even forms the ability to  become a part of their lives in absentia, thus compensating for his own loneliness. The two party's lives are indeed at opposite ends of the spectrum. The couple leads a busy, progressive and contemporary life, have many friends, live in a large, well furnished and warm home, while sy leads a lonely, predicatable and abysmal existance and resides in a lifeless, empty apartment. We are then presented with ""Sy's Wall"", a creepy collection of the family's photos from the time the kid was a newborn to the present.Sy desperately tries to be an ""uncle"" to the boy, and while many may perceive this as him being a pedophile, I don't think this was the intention. However, some scenes, especially when Sy meets the kid at the park, does make your skin crawl.When Sy finds out that Mr. Yorkin is unfaithful, he goes on a campaign to let Mrs.Yorkin know, and when she does, he witnesses the reaction from afar, and then gets ""revenge"" on Mr.Yorkin and his lover by confronting them during a tryst. I think the message Sy was trying to transmit to Mr. Yorkin was that: ""You stupid idiot, you have a great family, a house, and you want to throw it all away"".  I don't know whether Sy wanted to break the family up, or sought to avenge Mrs. Yorkin's devastation over her husband's infidelity. The movie climaxes with Sy running from the law, and eventually getting caught.

725299,A1Y1YRO74S6ELA,B00007976T,"GreatWriterChrisJames ""ChrisJames""","[2, 2]","''One Hour Photo'' this a great movie Ive watched several times.Robin Williams who has made his career as a clown early on in ''Mork And Mindy'' to the slimy carsalesman in ''Cadillac Man'' to Leslie Zevo in Toys but underneathall that comedic talent lies a talented dramatic actor.Remember ''Good Morning Vietnam'', ''Dead Poets Society'' , and ''Good Will Hunting''? These were all great movies showcasing the dramatic talent of Robin Williams.Obviously dumb critics new and old who thought Williams just did comedy were wrong (including the same critics from other sites I pointed out).So here we are in 2002 and Williams delivers another great dramatic performances, possibly his darkest and best perforamence.Under great director Mark Romanek who never really did a good film for several years, Williams portrays an isolated but warm human being named Sy Parrish, a guy who was worked at the same photo mart for all his life. Everyone loves Sy well everyone except his abusive and obnoxious boss Bill Owens (Gary Cole) He is a typical example of the scum that runs a company for his own personal profit while portraying this fake nice guy image which of course Sy knows is a lie.Sy is an expert in photography however director Romanek takes things a step further portraying saying as an obsessive photo collector which people can take itas good or bad. I took it as good, here is a guy who takes enough pride in his work to collect everything he has done. In fact it is this obsession which helps Sy uncovers the infedility of a selfish married man and the lies he has given to his family. In fact many critics failed to realize this labeling the Sy character as an obsessive voyeur/killer in the making. As said Sy works in the photo mart and comes to collect and process over a 10 yr period the magical kodak moments of the Yorkin family, Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and their son Jake (Dyland Smith).Sy has processed their prints for years and almost is a part of their family. Sy though of course obsessively collects his own personal prints to reflect back on what a great family they are and this is what gets Sy into trouble with Bill (Cole).Bill realizes that several prints of customers have been missing and he realizes it must be Sy. He fires Sy delivering some corporate crap which is meant to only savehis behind. However Sy though before he is fired uncovers the fact that Will Yorkin despite his Mr. Clean family man image has actually been sleeping around with another woman and lying to his family about it.I loved Robin Williams in this film he was exceptional. We see another great dramatic performance by Williams. He is fantastic even surpassing some supposed great overhyped dramatic actors like Anthony Hopkins. Williams through this character makesus think as to the actual value of what goes into a photo. It's a image in time made of joy usually, however it shows that photos do not tell the whole story. Obviouslly Will Yorkin is a cheating husband, something that he hides very well till the end.''One Hour Photo'' is a great movie possibly the best dramatic I've seen in a while.",5,"One Hour Photo, Robin Williams showcases his best work",1082937600,"04 26, 2004",2004,3130,"[""''One"", 'Hour', 'Photo', 'great', 'movie', 'Ive', 'watched', 'several', 'times.Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'clown', 'early', 'Mork', 'Mindy', 'slimy', 'carsalesman', 'Cadillac', 'Man', 'Leslie', 'Zevo', 'Toys', 'underneathall', 'comedic', 'talent', 'talented', 'dramatic', 'Good', 'Morning', 'Vietnam', 'Dead', 'Poets', 'Society', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'were', 'great', 'movies', 'showcasing', 'dramatic', 'talent', 'Robin', 'Williams.Obviously', 'critics', 'new', 'old', 'who', 'thought', 'Williams', 'just', 'did', 'comedy', 'were', 'wrong', 'including', 'same', 'critics', 'other', 'sites', 'pointed', 'out', '.So', 'here', 'are', '2002', 'Williams', 'great', 'dramatic', 'performances', 'possibly', 'darkest', 'best', 'perforamence.Under', 'great', 'director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'who', 'never', 'really', 'did', 'good', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'Williams', 'isolated', 'warm', 'human', 'being', 'named', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'guy', 'who', 'was', 'worked', 'same', 'photo', 'mart', 'life', 'Everyone', 'Sy', 'well', 'everyone', 'abusive', 'obnoxious', 'boss', 'Bill', 'Owens', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'typical', 'example', 'scum', 'company', 'own', 'personal', 'profit', 'portraying', 'fake', 'nice', 'guy', 'image', 'course', 'Sy', 'lie.Sy', 'expert', 'photography', 'however', 'director', 'Romanek', 'things', 'step', 'further', 'portraying', 'saying', 'obsessive', 'photo', 'collector', 'people', 'can', 'take', 'itas', 'good', 'bad', 'took', 'good', 'here', 'guy', 'who', 'enough', 'pride', 'work', 'collect', 'everything', 'done', 'fact', 'obsession', 'Sy', 'uncovers', 'infedility', 'selfish', 'married', 'man', 'lies', 'given', 'family', 'fact', 'many', 'critics', 'failed', 'realize', 'labeling', 'Sy', 'character', 'obsessive', 'voyeur/killer', 'making', 'said', 'Sy', 'works', 'photo', 'mart', 'collect', 'process', '10', 'yr', 'period', 'magical', 'kodak', 'moments', 'Yorkin', 'family', 'Nina', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'Will', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'son', 'Jake', 'Dyland', 'Smith', '.Sy', 'processed', 'prints', 'years', 'almost', 'part', 'family', 'Sy', 'course', 'obsessively', 'own', 'personal', 'prints', 'reflect', 'back', 'what', 'great', 'family', 'are', 'what', 'Sy', 'trouble', 'Bill', 'Cole', '.Bill', 'several', 'prints', 'customers', 'have', 'been', 'missing', 'must', 'be', 'Sy', 'Sy', 'delivering', 'corporate', 'crap', 'meant', 'only', 'savehis', 'behind', 'However', 'Sy', 'fired', 'uncovers', 'fact', 'Will', 'Yorkin', 'Mr.', 'Clean', 'family', 'man', 'image', 'actually', 'been', 'sleeping', 'around', 'woman', 'lying', 'family', 'it.I', 'loved', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'was', 'exceptional', 'see', 'great', 'dramatic', 'performance', 'Williams', 'fantastic', 'even', 'surpassing', 'supposed', 'great', 'overhyped', 'dramatic', 'actors', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', 'Williams', 'character', 'makesus', 'think', 'actual', 'value', 'what', 'photo', 'image', 'time', 'made', 'joy', 'usually', 'however', 'photos', 'do', 'not', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'Obviouslly', 'Will', 'Yorkin', 'cheating', 'husband', 'something', 'very', 'well', 'till', 'end', ""''One"", 'Hour', 'Photo', 'great', 'movie', 'possibly', 'best', 'dramatic', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while']",N/A

But, you can sympathize also with the vilain and the crazy person. Robin Williams plays a man that develops film for a living. While doing this, the person that watches this movie realizes that the developpers can know EVERYTHING about you. This made me feel uncomftorbable at times because even though I already knew this, I just never really had thought about it. But, William's character then becomes obsessed with one family and makes copies of all of their film and puts in on his walls. When you first see this, it's very disturbing.But, he still loves this family and dreams of being part of the family. He's always very nice to them but when one of the members of the family is ""insincere"" and has a secret that only William's character knows about while developping film, he goes absolutely insane. But, even after what he does, which I won't give away, you still sympathize with his character, feeling very sorry for him. You actually at a lot of moments disslike the member of the family that has commited this ""bad deed"" way more than you do Robin William's character.

725307,A2GBNMYG9P9KCM,B00007976T,Ixx,"[5, 7]","""One Hour Photo"" is a refreshing work of directory and acting genius. It takes a new, and much more realistic twist on the stalker genre. Meant to be more of a drama than a thriller, it actively does the work of both. It is a slow-paced, heart-wrenching movie because although the main character is silent as a ghost most of the time, you always know why - and that's what makes his character so appealing. You can't help but feel sorry for him.Seymour Parish, better known as ""Sy the Photo Guy"" is a photo-technician at a local SavMart. He takes his work seriously and genuinely likes his job. He knows his customers well and they don't have to tell him they want. One particular family whose photos he has been developing for many years, the Yorkins, he considers a perfect family. Having no family or friends of his own, he longs to become a part of their lives, and for them to be a part of his. He lives alone in a dreary apartment in the middle of downtown, where his obsession with this family has taken a hold of his mind.However, unlike stalkers such as Michael, Chucky, or  Jason, Sy is a kind, decent man with good intentions at heart. He doesn't want to harm the family in any way - he actually cares about them and wants to be with them. However, his social awkwardness prevents him from getting to know the family beyond a professional basis, and it makes him more and more unstable and frustrated.Everything in this film is outstanding - particularly the score - which, despite its electronic origins, is quite suitable. The sounds used in a few scenes (particularly the scene in Sy's apartment) give a very good backdrop to the feelings torturing Sy's mind. And contrary to what some may say, this is ANYTHING but techno. Quite the opposite, in fact. It reminds me more of slow ambiance. One way or the other, most or all of it is keyboarded, and it's excellent.This film is abundant in imagery and symbolism. Most of the seemingly filler scenes have hidden meaning which, when uncovered, will reveal more and more about Sy's troubled psyche.Despite what some may say, I think the ending is very good. This is not meant to be a horror movie or a thriller movie, so I think it added to that differentiation by ending it on a pleasant note. Having Sy end the movie the same way he began it would have been heartbreaking, since Sy never has evil intentions.All in all, a chill inducing, disturbing movie that earns a straight 6 out 5!

Gone is the performer's spastic, eardrum shattering personality so often seen when he appears on a talk show or in a stand up concert. Instead, we see a subdued, angry Robin Williams capable of inducing nightmares.Williams plays Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parrish, a lonely, middle-aged photo shop employee who has nothing in his life except the job. He is a one-hour photo development guy who works at one of those big chain department stores that sit on every other street corner across the country. One benefit of Sy's job is that he gets to know many of his customers on a first name basis, which for him constitutes his only interaction with other human beings. Parrish isn't married, doesn't have children or friends, and lives a rather bleak existence in a dim apartment. He doesn't have anything really except the copies of other people's pictures he clandestinely steals from the photo department. Parrish's favorite photos are from the Yorkin family: consisting of mother Nina, father Will, and son Jake. Nina and Jake have been coming into the photo lab for years to get their pictures developed, and Sy has taken quite a shine to them. Jake even refers to Parrish as &quot;Sy, the photo guy,&quot; a moniker Seymour takes as quite a compliment. Heck, after awhile he even feels like part of the family, so much so that he covers one whole wall of his apartment with stolen pictures of the Yorkins. If Sy cannot live with his adopted family, at least he can bring them into his own house and relive the family's most precious moments. The Yorkins look like the perfect little family on paper, and it isn't too long before Sy starts to step over the line. He &quot;accidentally&quot; runs into Nina Yorkin at the mall where the two engage in small talk, which, although meaning little to Nina, means the world to Sy. Then Jake &quot;accidentally&quot; runs across Parrish one day after school, when the photo guy just happens to bring the child a gift.Parrish's world becomes inseparable from the Yorkin's lives, to the point that he begins following them around every chance he gets. Sy has plenty of spare time on his hands because he loses his job at the photo mart after his boss fires him for stealing pictures. The loss of the job is devastating, but even more destructive to Parrish's fragile mental state is the sudden discovery of imperfection in the &quot;perfect&quot; Yorkin household. Nina and Will have problems, specifically over Jake and the father's inability to connect with his son. One problem leads to many more when Will Yorkin decides to take a dangerous step outside of his marriage and Sy Parrish is there to teach the sort of lesson no one could ever forget. The conclusion is a shocker because it takes a different approach from the usual stalker/obsessive person film.I liked &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot; Obviously, William's take on a guy who snaps psychologically is radically different from many of his other film roles. Sy Parrish is creepy and disconnected, and Williams successfully reveals to us the inner turmoil felt by this individual. Just as neat was the chain store where Sy worked. The place is so sterile, bright, and obsessively organized that I loved looking at the place whenever they showed it. Parrish's apartment with the hundreds of pictures on the wall gives you the chills when you see it, especially later when Sy goes on his rampage and the police find the pictures with Will Yorkin's face scratched out on every single snapshot. The best scene in the film was when we see Sy snooping around the Yorkin house and the family suddenly arrives home just in time to see...well, it's best that you watch the movie yourself to discover how this scene plays out. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; has some unforgettable moments.The few problems with the movie have little to do with the DVD release, which boasts a Charlie Rose interview with Williams, some behind the scenes stuff, and an interesting menu screen. After watching the &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; featurette on the disc, I realized that some of the messages the makers of &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; attempted to pass on to the viewer didn't exactly work. The scene in question involved Sy's first meeting with Will Yorkin in the department store. The director goes on and on about how the store represents a type of heaven to Parrish and how he proves his power over Yorkin by summoning help on the store intercom. I must have missed that when I watched the movie and I am not sure many viewers perceived that scene, or others, as the producers intended. Despite that, this movie is a must see for Robin Williams fans and a should see for all others.",4,Creeeeeeeepy!,1069718400,"11 25, 2003",2003,5713,"['am', 'best', 'indifferent', 'Robin', 'Williams',

From the very beginning you know the end of the movie as most of the movie is a flashback.  One Hour Photo is more about style and suspense than about what will happen next.  In this aspect the film succeeds marvelously.  By today's standards it's a slow paced movie to be certain but it builds suspense extremely well.  It reminds me of the suspense movies of the late 40's and 50's.  No explosions, no major action just a good solid story.  The visuals are amazing.  From the store where Robin williams character works to his home and the home of the family he becomes obsessed with.  All of the visuals evoke exactly the emotions that they are supposed to.  From alienation to compassion to obsession and everything in between.In a sense the entire movie is an indictment of our society and the alienation it causes in keeping to ourselves.

I hoped I could learn more about what Sy was thinking through comments made by the director and Robin. I am very satisfied with it. The segment where Robin and the director do an interview with Charlie Rose is typical. Robin going off on tangents, seemingly auditioning new characters, saying things that are funny but hard to absorb. Like Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football. For the full movie's commentary, Robin is surprisingly subdued. He isn't quiet but he stays in the same gear and is funnier for it, in my opinion. One thing I may never understand is what happened to the roll of film we see Sy shoot near the ending? When the police process the film, it's yet another twist. Did he swap rolls or did he ""pretend,"" as he said during the ""shoot""?Even people who don't like Robin will find this movie interesting, thought provoking and spooky. I fear this film will be passed over by many as I saw on Halloween, when I was dressed as Sy in his full store uniform. Some people got it right away, others didn't. At a large Halloween party with a contest, I was given a nomination for ""Scariest Male."" When I made the second round and was being judged by the head judges, one whispered to me: ""Scariest? I don't get it."" I'm not qualified to say if Robin could win an Oscar for this performance as I don't see a lot of movies.  2002 was not a good year for movies, in my opinion.

The just of the movie is that Williams is obsessed with a family that has been taking their film to be developed to his counter in a discount store for 10 years. He is so obsessed that he has been keeping duplicate photos of them in his own home since their now 10 year old son was born. Creepy and weird is Williams, but also lonely. The store in question looks like it was built 6 months ago and you can practically smell the fresh wall paint, but maybe they just recently moved to a new location. Either way, Williams is fired because auditing notices a discrepancy in the number of photos printed to the number sold. PLEASE! Yes Williams has a wall full of photos at home, but even a thousand photos over 10 years is going to disappear in the paperwork. The boss who looks like the guy who played Lumburg in Office Space fires him because the home office is peeved and someone is going down and its not going to be Lumborg. Preposterous in that Lumburg as the store manager knows anything about the photo department anyway, but the fact that such tight auditing is done when we know that anyone can refuse to pay for prints that are botched is just a silly plot device to drive Williams over the edge.

Sy has no life outside work, but lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for a steady customer, the Yorkin family.  Sy is particularly attracted to the family's young son, Jake (Dylan Smith), and the boy's mother, Nina (Connie Nielsen). Parrish's obsession is such that one wall of his apartment is completely covered with prints of the Yorkins snapped over the years. Sy fantasizes being part of the family - a favorite uncle, perhaps. This is all supremely creepy, but relatively harmless, until Sy discovers that the Man of the House, Will (Michael Vartan), is cheating on Nina. Things turn nasty. And what is Parrish going to do with that very large and very sharp hunting knife? (Russell Crowe's sword in GLADIATOR was only slightly larger.)The performance by Williams deserves an Oscar nomination. His role in this film, and that of the killer in the recent INSOMNIA, proves Robin's ability as a dramatic actor (if anyone had any doubts). The creators of ONE HOUR PHOTO were particular clever in contrasting Sy's sterile, lonely life with that ""normal"" existence lived by the Yorkins. While the latter's residence is stocked with the usual Stuff, both Parrish's downtown apartment and his workspace are compulsively neat, impersonal and soulless under harsh florescent lighting. (You can almost hear the bulbs hum.) Even the general merchandise aisles of the Savmart are curiously unpopulated, and the goods on the perfectly arranged shelves look untouched by human hands. The pressures building in Sy's psyche can only be guessed at, and there's one dream sequence that has him suffering a serious mishap in one of the Savmart's aisles that left the audience gasping.My only suggestion to improve ONE HOUR PHOTO would have been to totally eliminate the last scene in the police interview room. It seemed to me an unnecessary sop to the bleeding-heart philosophy that sometimes attempts to assign blame for one's actions on someone other than the doer. The film should have perhaps ended after the final scene in the Yorkin house.See this movie, and seriously consider converting to digital photography.

""One hour photo"" is an example, and the more recent ""Insomnia"" is another (I haven't watched ""Death to Smoochy""). I always thought Robin Williams was a one-character actor, meaning he couldn't change his performances from one movie to another - even the psychologist in ""Good Will Hunting"" and the troubled husband in ""What dreams may come"", like all other Williams' characters have a sound resemblance to Patch Adams. Well, in ""One hour photo"" and in ""Insomnia"" I was proved wrong. Not only Williams can play a problematic and sad character, he can be very convincing (although we always feel sorry for him).In ""One hour photo"", the Yorkes (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan and Dylan Smith) seem the perfect family for Sy Parrish (Robin Williams), the ""photo guy"" from a ... store. Sy is obsessed about the family. All the photo-sets the Yorke family get from Sy have a copy in Sy's house. When Sy gets to know the Yorkes aren't so perfect after all, he slowly but surely starts to plan his revenge.Being a movie essencially about obsession and photography, ""One hour photo"" is full of light (there is a light bulb, or the sun, or the moonlight in EVERY scene) and colorful. It just didn't work for me, because I was supposed to be watching a thriller, and in my conception (maybe I'm too old-fashioned) thrillers don't work if they're light- and colorful.Mark Romanek's script isn't innovative.

If there was anything creepy in this idiosyncratic movie it was the bland anonymity of the American Wal-Mart (the &quot;Sav-mart&quot;) with its enforced fake smiles with which the employees (the &quot;associates&quot;) are exhorted to meet the shopping clients and the sublimated brutality which underlies the ruthless corporate machine that dehumanizes both the buyer and the seller.  I am convinced part of the unease with which the average American meets this movie originates in the guilt he/she/we feel acknowledging the treatment we give these faceless &quot;associates&quot; in our shopping complexes.  Romanek provides us with an insightful visual vignette commentary which suggests that whenever we overlook another human being we become less human ourselves.My dominant response to Sy &quot;the photo guy&quot; was that of sadness. Sadness over the loneliness of a man who was never allowed to grow and unfold, who has been forced to suppress his rage so that all that remained was a bland, sterile facade with no inner life; someone who has found meaning only in other people's (perceived) happiness.  Do we see here any parallels with latter day obsession of the masses with celebrity and status?  Is your regular B.

His name is Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) and his job is really all he has.  There are social ingredients missing in Sy's mind, and as we get to closer to him we begin to put the pieces together.  He has nothing to live for outside of his job and the family that are his favorite customers.  The Yorkins; Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan), and their only child Jake are the customers Sy most enjoys producing prints for.  He sees them as the ideal family and he loves them so much that he creates copies of their prints for himself and he calls himself ""uncle"" Sy.  Unfortunately for Sy, the Yorkins are not aware of any of this.  Sy is awkward and socially inept.  He walks through life without the ability to relate appropriately with others and it begins to weigh in on him.  So what happens if Will Yorkin's friend Maya shows up with a roll of film of her own, and the pictures show her being intimate with Will?  What will Uncle Sy do?There is a genuine creepiness to Director Mark Romanek's One Hour Photo.  Romanek's ability to organize images to appropriately translate in the music video medium is evidently a solid carryover to his work as a feature filmmaker.  This movie has a remarkably unique feel to it and where most films of this genre would focus on the Yorkins as the protagonists, One Hour Photo has us staring directly at the empty and profoundly sad Sy Parrish.  Jeff Cronenweth, the film's cinematographer, also deserves immense praise for his blinding white SavMart shots and overall crisp photography.  The setting becomes Sy's element effortlessly, which is convenient because SavMart is Sy.  He has nothing to go home to.  The most praise though should land squarely upon Robin Williams.  His role is a completely unrecognizable transformation and even though he received praise and a Saturn Award, he may have received more if this performance was in a different genre.There is something about the way One Hour Photo unfolds that is appropriate but invariably predictable.  The ending doesn't hit as hard as the effective (and credit-less) opening scenes.  It's hard to say whether that is a criticism of the second half of One Hour Photo or a gigantic compliment to the first half.  I can't imagine a better ending that wouldn't come off as overly contrived or too psychological but all of this is very much just nitpicking.

Some people you probably don't much like get humiliated, but nobody even gets physically hurt in writer-director Mark Romanek's &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot;  What happens is far worse--their faith in humanity is shattered.The story is simple.  Photo finisher Seymour &quot;Sy the Photo Guy&quot; Parrish (Robin Williams) has a problem dividing reality from fantasy, and he imagines himself joining the photogenic Yorkin family, who trust him to develop their pictures.  As he drifts further and further into this imaginary world, he starts visiting young, naive Jake Yorkin (Dylan Smith) at soccer practice.  He engineers ways to run into pretty, empathic Nina Yorkin (Connie Neilsen) at the mall.  He strikes up random conversations with affluent, ambiguous Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan).  But he's so affable and unprepossessing that they all fail to notice anything out of the ordinary.Then Parrish finds out the dream world he's built for himself based on their pictures isn't picture-perfect.This film is a wonderful mystery, but from the beginning we know whodunnit and to whom.  What we seek to uncover is the motive, which is as elusive as a fresh, wet, slick photograph right up to the very end.  And even that end, with its powerful &quot;Lady or the Tiger&quot; lack of resolution, leaves us with more to figure out than what's been explained.This movie is going to be hard for a lot of people to watch.  Its careful pace and distinct atmospherics require viewers to meet the movie on its terms.  The dense plot demands much stricter attention than audiences are accustomed to these days.  And the style of themes seem drawn more from the world of literature than typical films.For lovers of literary mystery and art-house cinema, this is one of the strongest movies of recent years.  Many will balk at it, but this risky, esoteric film wasn't meant for them.  The complex, sophisticated structure rewards book-readers as much as cineastes.

He certainly deserves any and all accolades he earns from this film.  Connie Nielsen performs admirably in this film as well.In his feature film directing debut, Mark Romanek has written and directed a pure psychological thriller masterpiece.  From the simple concept of looking at a SavMart like store and coming up with this script, he has shown an amazing talent.  This is a director whose films are to be looked out for in the future.The soundtrack for this film is also quite dead on with every sequence and adds beautifully to the suspenseful nature of the film.The premise:Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parish (Robin Williams) works at the local SavMart as the photo technician.  He's been working there for eleven years and in a large sense he has no life other than his job.  During his daily routine at work, he sees everybody's lives, or more succinctly, their more joyful moments, in the pictures they bring in to be developed.  Somewhere along the line he has become thoroughly infatuated with one particular family, the Yorkins.  Sy even fantasizes about being Uncle Sy in the Yorkin family.When Sy suddenly suffers a catastrophic event in his life, he essentially flips all the way off of the rocker and what follows from there simply has to be one of the most suspenseful thrillers that this viewer has watched in quite some time.I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of this genre; it will make an excellent addition to your DVD library and will stand up quite well to multiple viewings.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:- Writer, Director and Actor Commentary- &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; Sundance Channel Featurette- &quot;Making of&quot; Featurette- &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot; Interview with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek- Theatrical Trailer and TV Spots",5,One Hour Photo - One highly suspenseful and enjoyable film!,1064102400,"09 21, 2003",2003,2309,"['Given', 'backdrop', 'local', 'SavMart', 'stunning', 'performance', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'film', 'deeply', 'scary', 'thriller', 'will', 'have', 'edge', 'seat', 'way', 'complete', 'fear', 'what', 'character', 'will', 'do', 'next', 'embarrassment', 'actions.This', 'most', 'certainly', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'scariest', 'role', 'date', 'one', 'least', 'like', 'completely', 'suppressed', 'comedic', 'nature', 'almost', 'clinical', 'persona', 'Seymour', 'quot', 'Sy', 'quot', 'Parish', 'certainly', 'accolades', 'film', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'admirably', 'film', 'well.In', 'feature', 'film', 'directing', 'debut', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'written', 'directed', 'pure', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'masterpiece', 'simple', 'concept', 'looking', 'SavMart', 'store', 'coming', 'up', 'script', 'shown', 'amazing', 'talent', 'director', 'films', 'are', 'be', 'looked', 'out', 'future.The', 'soundtrack', 'film', 'also', 'quite', 'dead', 'sequence', 'beautifully', 'suspenseful', 'nature', 'film.The', 'premise', 'Seymour', 'quot', 'Sy', 'quot', 'Parish', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'local', 'SavMart', 'photo', 'technician', 'been', 'working', 'there', 'eleven', 'years', 'large', 'sense', 'life', 'other', 'job', 'daily', 'routine', 'work', 'everybody', 'lives', 'more', 'succinctly', 'more', 'joyful', 'moments', 'pictures', 'bring', 'be', 'developed', 'Somewhere', 'line', 'become', 'thoroughly', 'infatuated', 'one', 'particular', 'family', 'Yorkins', 'Sy', 'even', 'being', 'Uncle', 'Sy', 'Yorkin', 'family.When', 'Sy', 'suddenly', 'catastrophic', 'event', 'life', 'essentially', 'way', 'rocker', 'what', 'simply', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'suspenseful', 'thrillers', 'viewer', 'watched', 'quite', 'time.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'fans', 'genre', 'will', 'make', 'excellent', 'addition', 'DVD', 'library', 'will', 'stand', 'up', 'quite', 'well', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'Writer', 'Director', 'Actor', 'Commentary-', 'quot', 'Anatomy', 'Scene', 'quot', 'Sundance', 'Channel', 'Featurette-', 'quot', 'Making', 'quot', 'Featurette-', 'quot', 'Charlie', 'Rose', 'Show', 'quot', 'Interview', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Mark', 'Romanek-', 'Theatrical', 'Trailer', 'TV', 'Spots']",N/A

Bernabo,"[2, 3]","Proving that he had depths of creepiness untouched by his performance in ""Insomnia,"" Robin Williams puts on some weight, dyes his hair blonde, and inhabits the body and less than complete life of Sy Parrish, who works at the photo lab at the local Sav*Mart (writer-director Mark Romanek talks about it being like a K-Mart or Target, but I am sure everybody who watches this immediately thinks Wal-Mart).  During all that time that he has been processing photographs, Sy has taken what can only be characterized as an unhealthy interest in the family of Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her son Jake (Dylan Smith).  Nina has a husband, Will (Michael Vartan), who works too much, but it turns out there are other more serious problems with the perfect life Sy has seen while developing her photographs all these years.Sy is a nobody, a non-entity dismissed by the rest of the world who sees everything that his life is not in the photographs he develops for the Yorkins.  He sees himself as their ""Uncle Sy,"" a kindly Dutch Uncle.  But Sy has a dark side, which only comes out when something he cares about, such as the setting of cyan on the photo printer, goes wrong, and as Sy starts to work his way into the lives of the Yorkins away from Sav*Mart he finds a fatal flaw in their perfect lives.  After all, Sy does not just develop photographs for them; he just always prints an extra set just for himself.However, for me there is one rather giant hole in this plot and that has to do with the access that Sy has to the entire store, especially after he is given the ax.  I have to tell you that I have worked in places that have fired employees and stood there watching them empty out their desks.  Under the circumstances that leave to Sy's termination, and given the antipathy that Bill Ownes (Gary Cole) feels for him, it just stretches the limits of my credulity that what happens would be allowed to happen.However, ""One Hour Photo"" earns back points because at the end of the film we find out, along with Detective Van Der Zee (Eriq LaSalle), not only why Sy did what he did, but also what he did--and it all fits together.  We are not talking about a stunning, spectacular resolution, but simply something that provides the final piece of the puzzle.  Lots of films never get that far and combined with the sustained creepiness of Robin Williams's performance, that is enough to warrant checking out ""One Hour Photo.""",4,Robin Williams in a sustained performance of creepiness,1058745600,"07 21, 2003",2003,2426,"['Proving', 'had', 'depths', 'creepiness', 'untouched', 'performance', 'Insomnia', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'weight', 'dyes', 'hair', 'blonde', 'body', 'less', 'complete', 'life', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'who', 'photo', 'lab', 'local', 'Sav*Mart', 'writer-director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'talks', 'being', 'K-Mart', 'Target', 'am', 'sure', 'everybody', 'who', 'immediately', 'Wal-Mart', 'time', 'been', 'processing', 'photographs', 'Sy', 'taken', 'what', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'characterized', 'unhealthy', 'interest', 'family', 'Nina', 'Yorkin', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'son', 'Jake', 'Dylan', 'Smith', 'Nina', 'husband', 'Will', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'who', 'too', 'much', 'out', 'are', 'other', 'more', 'serious', 'problems', 'perfect', 'life', 'Sy', 'seen', 'developing', 'photographs', 'years.Sy', 'nobody', 'non-entity', 'dismissed', 'rest', 'world', 'who', 'everything', 'life', 'not', 'photographs', 'Yorkins', 'Uncle', 'Sy', 'kindly', 'Dutch', 'Uncle', 'Sy', 'dark', 'side', 'only', 'out', 'when', 'something', 'about', 'such', 'setting', 'cyan', 'photo', 'printer', 'wrong', 'Sy', 'work', 'way', 'lives', 'Yorkins', 'away', 'Sav*Mart', 'fatal', 'flaw', 'perfect', 'lives', 'Sy', 'not', 'just', 'develop', 'photographs', 'just', 'always', 'extra', 'set', 'just', 'himself.However', 'one', 'rather', 'giant', 'hole', 'plot', 'do', 'access', 'Sy', 'entire', 'store', 'especially', 'given', 'ax', 'have', 'tell', 'have', 'worked', 'places', 'have', 'fired', 'employees', 'stood', 'watching', 'empty', 'out', 'desks', 'circumstances', 'leave', 'Sy', 'termination', 'given', 'antipathy', 'Bill', 'Ownes', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'feels', 'just', 'limits', 'credulity', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'allowed', 'happen.However', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'back', 'points', 'end', 'film', 'find', 'out', 'Detective', 'Van', 'Der', 'Zee', 'Eriq', 'LaSalle', 'not', 'only', 'why', 'Sy', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'also', 'what', 'did', 'together', 'are', 'not', 'talking', 'stunning', 'spectacular', 'resolution', 'simply', 'something', 'final', 'piece', 'puzzle', 'Lots', 'films', 'never', 'get', 'far', 'combined', 'sustained', 'creepiness', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'performance', 'enough', 'warrant', 'checking', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo']",N/A
725352,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00007976T,Lawyeraau,"[0, 0]","This is a superlative psychological thriller and one of the best in the genre,  with a bravura performance by Robin Williams as a somewhat unhinged photo technician. Deftly directed by Mark Romanek, who has an eye for detail and an understanding that less is sometimes more, it is simply one of the best films released in 2002.The plot line seems simple. Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an exacting  photo technician in a large, squeaky clean and bright, well stocked,  discount mall type store. A lonely, middle-aged man, he seems to fade into the background. He is the type of person of whom others are apt to take little notice. Polite and pleasant, he is seemingly inoffensive, yet, always a beat off. He also has one little foible. He has become obsessed with the Yorkin family.The Yorkins are customers of his for whom he develops photographs. He has been developing their photos for years and has seen most of their cherished moments, participating in them vicariously. It is as if Nina, Will, and  their young son, Jake,  have become his family, only the Yorkins haven't a clue about Sy's secret obsession. When Sy becomes aware that the sanctity of  his secret, picture perfect family is endangered, he becomes the avenging angel, setting into motion a series of events that reveal his own deepest, darkest secret.Robin Williams is absolutely sensational as Sy, the photo guy. He transforms himself, as if he were a chameleon. His performance is brilliant and well nuanced. As strange as Sy may seem at times, the viewer cannot help but like and pity him, even when he is at his weirdest. Sy's palpable longing to be a part of the Yorkin family is heartbreaking. Though most of his interaction is with Connie and Jake, as they are the ones who bring in the family photos to be developed, when Will comes to the store one day, Sy immediately recognizes him from the photos. Sy introduces himself to the surprised Will,  asking after his family and complimenting Will on his home, a place in which Sy has never been a guest. It is all slightly creepy, adding to the mounting tension in the film. Robin Williams plays the role of Sy to great effect, making the most of each and every moment that he is on screen. He is the quintessential lonely man, so isolated and alienated from those around him that any of his attempts at interaction with others is always a beat off.Connie Nielsen is luminous as Nina Yorkin, a woman who is always pleasant to Sy and brightens his day every time she and Jake walk in the store to have photos developed. She is a woman whose beaming countenance belies the knowledge that there is something wrong with her marriage. There is a canker taking hold of her suburban home, eating away at the core of her family, only she cannot get Will to discuss it rationally with her.  She does not know what is wrong, only that there is definitely something amiss, although all will, ultimately, be made clear to her.Michael Vartan is excellent as Will Yorkin, the good looking, though slightly unlikable, husband. Dylan Smith gives a sweet performance as Jake Yorkin. Erin Daniels is perfectly cast as Maya, a woman for whom Sy also develops photos. Eriq La Salle is very good as the sensitive Detective Van Der Zee. Gary Cole is terrific as the high energy store manager who gets on Sy's case about a number of issues that are coming to light in connection with the seemingly placid Sy. This is a solid cast that contributes to the overall success of this interesting and quirky film.The sets are also used most effectively. The bright, almost bleached, starkness of the huge store set is a perfect setting for Sy, as he almost melds into the background, at times, as if he were disappearing. Only his bright blue store vest saves him from total obscurity. This is fraught with meaning, as it is his job that helps to keep Sy grounded.  The Yorkin home is filled with earth tones, giving a homey, cozy glow, enshrouding the family in a haze of warmth. Sy's own apartment is a sterile, ugly environment. There is nothing cozy about it. The only real sign that someone may actually live there are the photographs of the Yorkins that are displayed for all the world to see.Moreover, just when one thinks one has it all figured out, there are more surprises to come. This is simply a brilliant film on many fronts. The direction, Robin Williams' performance, the sets, the restrained, low key, tension building approach, and the twist in the ending, all contribute to making this a film to add to one's collection.

One Hour Photo, however, goes quite beyond the cliches of such movies and deals in a fresh manner with topics such as the reasons people take pictures, the sterility of modern workplaces, loneliness and, of course, obsession. Robin Williams is not as miscast as you might think as the loner whose entire life revolves around the pictures he develops at SavMart's photo counter. In a much-needed departure from his usual sappy roles, Williams turns his kindly, naive personality an additional few degrees into madness. SavMart is perfectly conveyed as the generic modern shopping center, with endless aisles and an oppressive whiteness that pervades everything. The entire movie is filled with scenes of such vast, impersonal spaces; these images tell a story of their own, apart from (though not unrelated to) that of the characters. Williams plays Sy Parrish, who is is fixated upon a seemingly ideal family. When he takes pictures of them, he saves prints for himself. He covers the walls of his apartment with these photos. In the fantasy world he inhabits, Sy is an extended family member. Things fall apart for Sy when his boss discovers his transgression and fires him. At the same time, he makes a disconcerting discovery about a member of his adopted family. Sy's behavior as his delusionary world begins to crumble, though it is handled in an interesting and suspenseful way, is not really the point of this film.

The movie has Robin playing opposite his usual crazy character type and he pulls it off magnificently.Sy Parrish worked 11 years at a One Hour Photo located in a Super Store that looks like a Wal-Mart.  He lives a stark, lonely life working under fluorescent lights in a bright white and blue store with aisles and aisles of bargains, then he drives his small car home to a sterile apartment.  Sy narrates the story that through our photographs we seem to live a happy, no-problem existence.  No one takes photos of the things you don't want to remember.  Time is held still in photos.Sy has customers he describes and types of photos they take.  It is a funny and wry way he observes what they deem important in life.  Sy has lived a lonely life, no wife or sweetheart, but has lived vicariously through the young family of Nancy Yorkin (Connie Nelson) and her family.  Sy has made a pretend life of being the loving Uncle to Jake Yorkin (Dylan Smith). Their home and family is beautiful, warm and welcoming as their many photos over the years have shown to Sy.  Sy escapes his dreary life through their photos and his imagination.  Sy makes extra copies of all the Yorkins' photographs over the years and has a wall showing the family growing from two to three with little Jake.  Sy makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable as he strives to actually be part of the Yorkin's lives.Because his judgement has been impaired and he has become unstable the boss at the store has to fire him.

Still, it is a movie that is very much worth seeing.I'd heard good word about One Hour Photo, but went into it knowing little beyond the observation that Robin Williams' character was creepy. That didn't surprise me. I've always felt that, beneath the machine-gun style joke slinging, there is something, well, pathological about Mr. Williams. No, I don't think he is a psychopath like his character in this movie. However, let's just say that I always felt that being creepy was part of his less well advertised repertoir. (Come on. Patch Adams was creepy. Admit it.)Let me cut to the chase. This movie is about the writing; about the directing; about the cinematography; and, mostly, about a stunning, understated performance by Williams. There are some flaws here. The actors who play the suburban family on whom Williams' character obsesses turn in relatively weak performances; but, fortunately, their roles are small. Williams so dominates the screen, and does his work so well, that it isn't a distraction that the rest of the world he inhabits seems a bit two dimensional (much like all those photographs in which he lives). I should note that the actor who plays his boss at the SavMart turns in a solid performance, as well. This is critical since Williams' fate at the SavMart, at the hands of this boss, is the core, and entirely credible, linchpin around which this psychological thriller revolves.The music and sound effects are generally used well, although they are a bit heavy handed at times. And the interesting shots and colors are reminiscent of artistic photography--adding a magnificent texture and appeal to the film.This film is creepy, and it sits with you.

The family that Robin Williams gets a little obsessed with?  The father is some yuppie flake who's got about the same presence as a guy in a dandruff commercial.

The detective yells in her face, once its become clear that jeopardizing shenanigans are afoot.  She blinks and slowly shakes her head and says in a voice devoid of emotion, ""He's... at a friend's house...""  The kid himself, who all the fuss is about is basically just a kid, who commands about as much interest as most kids - zero.  Robin Williams doesn't have sexual designs on the kid.  He doesn't have sexual designs on the mother, and though he does end up taking some - shall we say, artistic? - photos, he doesn't have sexual designs on the father.  So what is his angle?  Well, suffice it to say that his own family was not so hot, so he's become a trifle obsessed with what he sees as the perfect family.  Maybe its part of the whole idea that the family he does get obsessed with is nothing to write home about and in fact makes the viewer vaguely nauseous.  Maybe, as in Taxi Driver, what the misguided protagonist sees and what is really there are two different things.

I think he's a lighting genius and his hyper reality style makes the artist look ultra-perfect. Mark bring this artistic style to his directorial debut. Although I'm a big fan of it, I did find it a bit distracting in a movie format. According to the director's commentary on the DVD, his intention was to make the movie somewhat hyper realistic, but everything is just a bit too squeaky clean.Yet, this fits the story somewhat, in that the characters are somewhat stereotypical. The dialog is fairly good, but in some of the more deeper sections, the dialog is a bit lacking. The relationship between the Mrs. Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and the Mr. Yorkin (Michael Vartan, of Alias fame) is one of the weaker points of the movie. They simply didn't have much in the way of chemistry and their relationship wasn't clearly established. You know that they have problems in their relationship, but it's vague and un-authentic.The standout performance has to go to Robin Williams. What was most impressive about his work in this film was his ability to condense himself into such a quiet and contained character. We all know him as this over-the-top extrovert and in this role he is supposed to blend into the background, which he does. When he blows his gasket, which you know he's going to do, you imagination just runs wild. He's such a lonely character in such need for some type of contact that you just feel for him.Another performance that surprised me was that of Dylan Smith, who plays the Yorkin's son Jake. His role wasn't all that large, but he really did well in it. You could tell he was really listening when he was in scene and he did a lot of small movements, like playing with a toy somewhat distractedly, that just seemed so natural. This was his first role in a movie, but you wouldn't know it from watching him work.Although the movie is a bit stylized and somewhat sterile in it's storytelling, it's a very engaging movie.

Its premise may be unlikely but it's still chillingly plausible. What if that nice man at the store where you have your photos developed has a dangerous obsession with your family? What if alienation and loneliness causes him to start acting out his fantasies?Seymour Parrish [Robin Williams] is a quiet but pleasant middle-aged man who has worked for years in the photo department of a local discount store. He lives alone in a forlorn apartment. His social interactions seem limited to the store. This is the place where Nina and Will Yorkin, an apparently ideal couple has had family photos developed since their eight-year old son was an infant. What they don't know is that Seymour has made them his `adopted' family. He fantasizes about being a beloved relative. The Yorkins, however, turn out not to be the perfect family, and when Seymour discovers this, he goes off the deep end.Robin Williams gives one of his finest performances as Seymour and is even scarier than he was as the killer in ""Insomnia"". Connie Nielson and Michael Vartan are quite convincing as the Yorkins. The movie's set and art design are especially good, strikingly contrasting Seymour's cold, blue-white world with the warm, earthy tones of the Yorkins'.""One Hour Photo"" is more than a mere thriller. It is a vivid portrait of an ordinary man torn apart by the ravages of alienation.

After hearing what videos Mark had directed, Robin signed up to do the picture.The movie? Well, I was anticipating it to be far more gruesome/graphic. Thankfully it wasn't. You're left feeling like you'd watched something by Hitchcock.Extras? Well, the Charlie Rose interview with Robin &amp; Mark is absolutely hilarious. A *must* see.

725366,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00007976T,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 2]","I HIGHLY recommend that if you haven't seen this movie, then go and rent a copy, or get it dead cheap. My mouth was open with disbelief & shock throughout most of the movie, and I was certainly getting shivers up my spine, the creeps, the works basically!!! I suggest if you haven't gone digital yet, go!!! Although, despite me having a digital camera, I get them developed online, so I can put them in a photo album. I just wouldn't go and hand in a film at somewhere local now. Believe me, once you see this movie you won't be either. Digital is great in more than ways than one, and this film will definitely make you rush out and get a digital camera!What also gave me the creeps was Robin Williams's excellently portrayed character, Sy, in this. Moving away from his ""family-friendly"" characters he's played in the past, this will have you longing for Hook or Mrs Doubtfire. Strangely enough, he plays a creepy character really, REALLY well!!! I wouldn't have expected it before seeing this. What he wears also adds to the character. And then there his hair, which is really cropped, and dyed a sandy colour. Horrible but suits the character. Because of his extremely hairy body (ugh) Robin had to shave most of his arms, upper chest and hands for this movie.The film focuses on a lonely photo-developing guy called ""Sy, the Photo Guy"". He quickly becomes obsessed with this young family, the Yorkins. Connie Nielsen plays Nina, the mum, Will is played by Michael Vartan and their kid Jake (Dylan Smith). His obsessions include practically memorising their address, buying the same book Nina is reading, visiting their house (and something even creepier happens here, which will have you wondering exactly what happened), and keeping an extra set of prints of their photos for himself. The film snowballs from here, keeping you in shock most of the movie, and almost feeling like you need to have a good, long, hard scrub in the shower afterwards.This movie is well written, and well shot, I can't find fault with it at all. The plot is well laid out - even the money shot of all the pictures on the wall is played out while we're distracted by a joke from the Simpsons on TV. (The episode is Cape Fear, the second episode of season 5.) Robin Williams quite literally becomes Sy Parish, and you'll go through different feelings towards his character, but by the end, although a little confusing (and most people will NOT get it, judging by some of the reviews), will return Sy Parish to the Robin Williams we know & love. The ending is left hanging, after a nail biting finale, and it's kind of like Lost In Translation, you're not quite sure what happens. The final moments will kinda ruin things, with Sy giving a reason why he did what he did. There was no need to give a reason. Everyone feels protective of people, and that's exactly what Sy was trying to do. It wasn't so much a mistake as unnecessary to have Sy tell the police (but mainly the audience) about his childhood, ""explaining"" his subsequent behaviour by letting us know he was abused as a child, all too neatly adding that his father used to take photos of him doing degrading things. This was just added in for no reason, and most people will question it.I bet the cast & crew had great fun with this movie, with all the photos prominently displayed in the scenes. I bet they were sick of being in front of the camera after this! I also loved the little segment, which actually showed you how Sy went about developing the photos. Although probably not all true, for me, it brought back some bad memories of being locked in a tiny dark room at college, trying to break open the canister to get the negatives out, which promptly turned purple when I tried to get them developed. It looks an interesting - although could be boring after a while - job, and in preparation for his role, Robin trained for two and a half days at a photo developing training facility in Southern California on an Agfa MSC 101-D photo developing machine.I strongly recommend everybody sees this movie, although sit on your hands if you're a nail biter, and don't look into the ending too much - it'll just ruin the movie for you.",4,Will give you the creeps,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,4179,"['HIGHLY', 'recommend', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'movie', 'then', 'go', 'rent', 'copy', 'get', 'dead', 'cheap', 'mouth', 'was', 'open', 'disbelief', 'shock', 'most', 'movie', 'was', 'certainly', 'getting', 'shivers', 'spine', 'creeps', 'works', 'basically', 'suggest', 'have', ""n't"", 'gone', 'digital', 'yet', 'go', 'having', 'digital', 'camera', 'get', 'developed', 'online', 'can', 'put', 'photo', 'album', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'hand', 'film', 'somewhere', 'local', 'now', 'Believe', 'once', 'see', 'movie', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'either', 'Digital', 'great', 'more', 'ways', 'one', 'film', 'will', 'definitely', 'make', 'rush', 'out', 'get', 'digital', 'camera', 'What', 'also', 'gave', 'creeps', 'was', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'excellently', 'portrayed', 'character', 'Sy', 'Moving', 'away', 'family-friendly', 'characters', 'played', 'past', 'will', 'have', 'longing', 'Hook', 'Mrs', 'Doubtfire', 'Strangely', 'enough', 'creepy', 'character', 'really', 'REALLY', 'well', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'expected', 'seeing', 'What', 'also', 'character', 'then', 'hair', 'really', 'cropped', 'dyed', 'sandy', 'colour', 'Horrible', 'suits', 'character', 'extremely', 'hairy', 'body', 'ugh', 'Robin', 'had', 'shave', 'most', 'arms', 'upper', 'chest', 'hands', 'movie.The', 'film', 'lonely', 'photo-developing', 'guy', 'called', 'Sy', 'Photo', 'Guy', 'quickly', 'obsessed', 'young', 'family', 'Yorkins', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'Nina', 'mum', 'Will', 'played', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'kid', 'Jake', 'Dylan', 'Smith', 'obsessions', 'include', 'practically', 'memorising', 'address', 'buying', 'same', 'book', 'Nina', 'reading', 'visiting', 'house', 'something', 'even', 'creepier', 'happens', 'here', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'keeping', 'extra', 'set', 'prints', 'photos', 'film', 'snowballs', 'here', 'keeping', 'shock', 'most', 'movie', 'almost', 'feeling', 'need', 'have', 'good', 'long', 'hard', 'scrub', 'shower', 'afterwards.This', 'movie', 'well', 'written', 'well', 'shot', 'ca', ""n't"", 'find', 'fault', 'plot', 'well', 'laid', 'out', 'even', 'money', 'shot', 'pictures', 'wall', 'played', 'out', ""'re"", 'distracted', 'joke', 'Simpsons', 'TV', 'episode', 'Cape', 'Fear', 'second', 'episode', 'season', '5', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'quite', 'literally', 'Sy', 'Parish', ""'ll"", 'go', 'different', 'feelings', 'character', 'end', 'little', 'confusing', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'NOT', 'get', 'judging', 'reviews', 'will', 'return', 'Sy', 'Parish', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'know', 'love', 'ending', 'left', 'hanging', 'nail', 'biting', 'finale', 'kind', 'Lost', 'Translation', ""'re"", 'not', 'quite', 'sure', 'what', 'final', 'moments', 'will', 'kinda', 'ruin', 'things', 'Sy', 'giving', 'reason', 'why', 'did', 'what', 'did', 'was', 'need', 'give', 'reason', 'Everyone', 'feels', 'protective', 'people', 'exactly', 'what', 'Sy', 'was', 'trying', 'do', 'was', ""n't"", 'so', 'much', 'mistake', 'unnecessary', 'have', 'Sy', 'tell', 'police', 'mainly', 'audience', 'childhood', 'explaining', 'subsequent', 'behaviour', 'letting', 'know', 'was', 'abused', 'child', 'too', 'neatly', 'adding', 'father', 'used', 'take', 'photos', 'doing', 'degrading', 'things', 'was', 'just', 'added', 'reason', 'most', 'people', 'will', 'question', 'it.I', 'cast', 'crew', 'had', 'great', 'fun', 'movie', 'photos', 'prominently', 'displayed', 'scenes', 'bet', 'were', 'sick', 'being', 'front', 'camera', 'also', 'loved', 'little', 'segment', 'actually', 'showed', 'how', 'Sy', 'went', 'developing', 'photos', 'probably', 'not', 'true', 'brought', 'back', 'bad', 'memories', 'being', 'locked', 'tiny', 'dark', 'room', 'college', 'trying', 'break', 'open', 'canister', 'get', 'negatives', 'out', 'promptly', 'turned', 'purple', 'when', 'tried', 'get', 'developed', 'interesting', 'could', 'be', 'boring', 'while', 'job', 'preparation', 'role', 'Robin', 'trained', 'two', 'half', 'days', 'photo', 'developing', 'training', 'facility', 'Southern', 'California', 'Agfa', 'MSC', '101-D', 'photo', 'developing', 'machine.I', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'everybody', 'movie', 'sit', 'hands', ""'re"", 'nail', 'biter', 'do', ""n't"", 'look', 'ending', 'too', 'much', ""'ll"", 'just', 'ruin', 'movie']",N/A

A lonely, compulsively orderly man, Sy has created a family for himself via the photos he processes at the local SavMart---especially those of the Yorkins, a family of three that Sy is so taken with, he imagines himself an ""uncle"" in the family.  Robin Williams gives a wonderfully controlled and chilling performance as Sy, the man whose obsession with the Yorkins leads him to an act of confrontation and near violence.  The supporting cast is very good too, particularly Gary Cole as Sy's callous boss Bill; Connie Nielsen as Mrs. Yorkin displays an interesting variety of emotional ups and downs; and little Dylan Smith is quietly effective as the little boy.  Despite a prepondency to pedophilia, I don't feel Williams is a real threat to this family.  Certainly his behavior is questionable, but I don't think he would ever do anything to harm his ""family"" and when he loses his job, he loses this ""family.""  His reaction to that loss is not ""normal"" per se, but not threatening either.  I didn't find myself ""chilled"" by this movie as many other reviewers did.  Despite Williams' masterful performance, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him and didn't feel he would really do anything murderous to anyone.

Ever since I saw Robin play the angry dad, if only for a few seconds, at the end of Mrs. Doubtfire, I realized that he would make a really scary villain. And honestly, he's not even a villain in One Hour Photo (although the director really wants you to think just that). He's more of an anti-hero.Williams' strength is that he's playing against type. We know he's a nut -- in a good way -- and expect him to burst out into showtunes at any moment. This just makes the bubbling cauldron of his emotions that much more compelling.And oh yea, Williams supposedly playd Dungeons &amp; Dragons once or twice. Which makes me like him even more.One Hour Photo's plot is simple: a photo clerk (Sy Parrish, played by Williams) at the local Wal-mart (er, Sav-Mart) sees things. Lots of things. Things he isn't always meant to see. He becomes obsessed with a family and has pictures of them all over his wall. It could happen to anyone -- it could be happening right now. Do you REALLY know what happens to your photos when you bring them in?Things take a turn for the worse when Sy discovers, through his job, that not all is at it seems in said happy family. When he discovers infidelity -- that the image he clung to is in fact horribly tainted and all too real, he snaps. And as he snaps, we descend from the heavenly glow of the Sav-Mart's white lights to a dizzying kaleidoscope of hell.The lensing is a primary character in this film: Greens, yellows, and reds (the color separation of photos, get it?) are all carefully lensed to give a surreal edge to Sye's rage, his madness, his sorrow. Colors are dissonant even though Sye himself is nearly invisible in his pastel clothes. His home is a stark, barren wasteland of color. The only thing that bothered me about the lensing is that the colors often seemed randomly placed -- something I have been trained by other directors to look for as a hint to further meaning in the movie (thanks to Spielberg and the red coat in Schindler's List and Shamalayan's red everything in Sixth Sense). But that's on purpose too, as there IS no meaning to Sye's world beyond the pictures he takes.One Hour Photo is as much about the ideal American family that you see in department store catalogs as it is about Eleanor Rigbys of the world. For every American ideal, there is a flawed interior. For every pleasant, affable man, there is a demon waiting to be unleashed.The ending is twisted and poignant, although some might feel it's a cop out. It explains Sye's history, why he so desperately needs a perfect family in his head, and why pictures hold so much affection for him. It also explains his subsequent violence and rage when said family cannot live up to his ideals. There's even a twist at the end -- something Maleficent picked up on but that I missed.This is one of those movies that I didn't like nearly as much until thinking about it afterwards. It's a classic depiction of suburban hell, an intellectual horror. It reminded me a lot of Session 9, only without the insane asylum.See it, but don't expect a slasher flick (despite the trailers).",5,"See it, but don't expect a slasher flick",1079913600,"03 22, 2004",2004,3150,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'bad', 'guy', 'Must', 'be', 'joke', 'right', 'joke', 'Ever', 'saw', 'Robin', 'play', 'angry', 'dad', 'only', 'few', 'seconds', 'end', 'Mrs.', 'Doubtfire', 'realized', 'would', 'make', 'really', 'scary', 'villain', 'honestly', 'not', 'even', 'villain', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'director', 'really', 'think', 'just', 'more', 'anti-hero.Williams', 'strength', 'playing', 'type', 'know', 'nut', 'good', 'way', 'expect', 'burst', 'out', 'showtunes', 'moment', 'just', 'bubbling', 'cauldron', 'emotions', 'much', 'more', 'compelling.And', 'oh', 'yea', 'Williams', 'supposedly', 'playd', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'once', 'twice', 'Which', 'even', 'more.One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'plot', 'simple', 'photo', 'clerk', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'played', 'Williams', 'local', 'Wal-mart', 'er', 'Sav-Mart', 'things', 'Lots', 'things', 'Things', ""n't"", 'always', 'meant', 'see', 'obsessed', 'family', 'pictures', 'wall', 'could', 'happen', 'anyone', 'could', 'be', 'happening', 'right', 'now', 'Do', 'REALLY', 'know', 'what', 'photos', 'when', 'bring', 'Things', 'take', 'turn', 'worse', 'when', 'Sy', 'discovers', 'job', 'not', 'said', 'happy', 'family', 'When', 'infidelity', 'image', 'fact', 'horribly', 'tainted', 'too', 'real', 'descend', 'heavenly', 'glow', 'Sav-Mart', 'white', 'lights', 'dizzying', 'kaleidoscope', 'hell.The', 'lensing', 'primary', 'character', 'film', 'Greens', 'yellows', 'reds', 'color', 'separation', 'photos', 'get', 'are', 'carefully', 'lensed', 'give', 'surreal', 'edge', 'Sye', 'rage', 'madness', 'sorrow', 'Colors', 'are', 'dissonant', 'even', 'Sye', 'nearly', 'invisible', 'pastel', 'clothes', 'home', 'stark', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'color', 'only', 'thing', 'bothered', 'lensing', 'colors', 'often', 'seemed', 'randomly', 'placed', 'something', 'have', 'been', 'trained', 'other', 'directors', 'look', 'hint', 'further', 'meaning', 'movie', 'thanks', 'Spielberg', 'red', 'coat', 'Schindler', 'List', 'Shamalayan', 'red', 'everything', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'purpose', 'too', 'meaning', 'Sye', 'world', 'pictures', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'as', 'much', 'ideal', 'American', 'family', 'see', 'department', 'store', 'catalogs', 'Eleanor', 'Rigbys', 'world', 'American', 'ideal', 'flawed', 'interior', 'pleasant', 'affable', 'man', 'demon', 'waiting', 'be', 'unleashed.The', 'ending', 'twisted', 'poignant', 'might', 'feel', 'cop', 'out', 'Sye', 'history', 'why', 'so', 'desperately', 'perfect', 'family', 'head', 'why', 'pictures', 'hold', 'so', 'much', 'affection', 'also', 'subsequent', 'violence', 'rage', 'when', 'said', 'family', 'can', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'ideals', 'even', 'twist', 'end', 'something', 'Maleficent', 'picked', 'up', 'missed.This', 'one', 'movies', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'thinking', 'classic', 'depiction', 'suburban', 'hell', 'intellectual', 'horror', 'reminded', 'lot', 'Session', '9', 'only', 'insane', 'asylum.See', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'slasher', 'flick', 'trailers']",N/A

However, Sy (Williams) is actually NOT one of those normal people.Sy the Photo Guy is a man who takes exceptional pride in his work as the film developer par excellence at the neighborhood Savmart.  From the grain detail to the tint of the prints, Sy consumes himself with making the recorded picture memories of people as memorable and as true to life as possible.  With one customer, though, he takes this dedication too far.The Yorkins are a &quot;picture-perfect&quot; family comprised of the attractive mother Nina (Connie Nielsen), the handsome father Will (&quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;'s Michael Vartan), and an adorable young son Jake.  Their frequent trips to the Savmart have allowed Sy to get close to them through the sunshine images of their family photos.  We soon realize that Sy has an unhealthy obssession with their happiness, and he finds himself fantasizing about being a part of the utopic lives of the Yorkin family.  He even goes so far as to reprint all of their photos to frame in his own home, and he begins to stakeout the family's home and spy on their son.The rub comes along when Sy discovers that Will Yorkin has been having an affair with one of his coworkers.  With good intentions, Sy tries to tell Nina about her husband's wrongdoings, but when he sees that Nina won't confront Will about it, Sy takes on a more proactive role in their lives.  This is where the movie begins to take an even more bizarre turn...Which I won't share.  :p  This film is a great psychological maze, with Robin Williams, comedic genius, playing this most unlikely role.  It is a story of how loneliness can transform people and how suppressed emotions and motivations can escalate into bizarre circumstances.

This comes as no surprise since it is a well known fact that the studios dump their worst films in this time period but get big name stars to try and get some profit from the flicks. Perfect examples in the summer of 2002 would have to be Serving Sara, with Elizabeth Hurley and Matthew Perry, and S1m0ne, featuring Al Pacino, with both failing to find an audience. Another genre that is explored greatly at this time is horror but they don't always succeed even with small budgets like Feardot.com proved. Those are reasons why at this time in the year independent films come out in full force and show to Hollywood that you don't need big budgets to make a successful film. Among these is the film that critics have been raving about since its debut at the Sundance Film Festival, One Hour Photo. Robin Williams, the star of the independent flick, is the main draw as no other star has really drawn any recognition before like him. The year 2002 since to be the transition year for Williams to move from the happy go-lucky characters, he is best known for, to more dramatic roles. But does Williams' creepy performance deliver the goods or is the film underdeveloped?The story of One Hour Photo focuses on a family and a lonely Savmart photo clerk. Seymour Parish, or Sy the Photo Guy as he is known to some of the regular customers, is the photo manager of the local Savmart who has worked there day in and day out for the past eleven years with little if any problems. In those long years, Sy becomes attached to a family that regularly comes to the Savmart and drops off their family photos to be developed. Without a loving family of his own, Sy becomes very attached to the family and ""adopts"" himself into the Yorkin family even becoming a sort of ""uncle"" to the son, Jack Yorkin, who lives a so-called happy life with his mother and workaholic father. This attachment soon turns in obsession as he follows the mother, Nina, around and pretends to meet her by coincidence in the mall. He evens buys presents for Jack and visits his soccer games. Things begin to spiral out of control after Sy is fired from Savmart for wasting prints by copying the Yorkin family pictures for himself. Sy soon loses control once he learns the dark secret of the father, Will Yorkin. The great thing about the story for One Hour Photo is that it sticks strongly the destructive path of Sy the Photo Guy and doesn't veer off that track very much. But when it does veer off from time to time, it is usually just a dream sequence or some small scene that doesn't last for too long. The intensity of the plot makes the film a great edge of your seat thriller and doesn't become too much for the audience it is intended for.The cast of One Hour Photo is very well put together and present an outside view of what a normal family looks like which, in the end, reveals that nothing is as it seems. Robin Williams, who takes the role of Sy the Photo Guy, presents his best and most creepy performance of his career. Williams, who also starred in the dramatic Insomnia, really tries hard to fit into the role of Sy by giving a familiar charming look to the character, complete with loose glasses, white shirt and creepy smile, that makes the character all the more chilling. Not only is his performance well done but Williams' chilling narrative in portions of the presentation is also very stirring. Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan are perfect choices as the ""perfect"" couple of Nina and Will Yorkin. They each present brilliant performances that don't draw attention away from the real story of Sy Parrish. The only problem that can be seen within the cast would have to be Gary Cole who plays Jack Yorkin, the family's son. The character came off as being too cute and, as his mother put it, ""too sensitive"", though his performance was better then most child actors.Overall, One Hour Photo delivers more positives then negatives by the end of the feature film. The biggest highlight of the film has to be the brilliant and creepy performance given by Robin Williams as the photo clerk of Savmart. Williams will surely be the biggest draw and that is probably what Fox Searchlight is counting on. The story is very well done but some things that are thrown at the audience are a bit too much. One example would have to be a dream sequence involving Sy and blood from his eyes. The only other problem with the film would have to be the annoying performance of Gary Cole but luckily he isn't seen too much within the course of the film. One Hour Photo delivers what it was meant to which is a dark dramatic look at the so-called ""picture-perfect"" life of the modern nuclear family. If Hollywood hasn't gotten the hint after the indie-hit My Big Fat Greek Wedding then they should definitely hear it from One Hour Photo. The message is this: Good performances and better stories mean more then big name stars and loud special effects. Hopefully they will listen this time around.",4,The Moose Hole - 'Photo' Produces Less Negatives,1073692800,"01 10, 2004",2004,5140,"['end', 'Summer', '2002', 'be', 'following', 'trend', 'past',

When they hand over their rolls he prints an extra set for himself, literally covering his walls at home with their pictures, gradually feeling that he's one of them (uncle Sy). Apart from being an exciting character in his own right, the production design makes him blend in with his surroundings, being a part of them on an allegorical level.

You either get it, or you don't...it's as simple as that.Robin Williams gives a stunning performance in this psychological thriller that is sure to at the very least, get him an Oscar nomination nod.  Williams plays ""Sy the Photo Guy"" at a discount store  Sav-Mart which, for all of us in America is all too familiar.  Sy takes absolute care and pride in his work, to the point of obsession (the altercation with the photo processing technician gives you your first peak at just how seriously Sy takes his work).  Sy becomes obsessed over one family in particular and dreams of becoming part of the family as ""Unlce Sy"".  Seemingly harmless on the surface, you find  that as the film progresses Sy may not be as harmless as one would think.In the opening sequence, Sy narrates a tale of his customers from the new parent with the endless rolls of film, to the amatuer pornographer, which at this point you start to think, ""should I be taking all of my film to the same place to be developed?""Mark Romanek's theatrical debut as a director is stunnng.  The camera work is exceptional, from the enormous glaring halogen staleness of the Sav-Mart, to the drab environment in which Sy lives in at home, to the warm inviting coloration of the family to which he has become, in his own mind, an important figure in.  The set design, costumes and overall look and feel of this film is realistic, and yet has moments where the glaring sterility of everyday life for  a middle aged single male practically smacks you in the face.Some people may find the film a tad slow, but every single frame of this is neccessary in order to fully develop the feeling, mood and the characters themselves.In particular, the ending is something that you absoluetly do not expect, but give yourself a couple of moments to think and it will become very clear as to what the motivation of the characters, screenwriter and director was.I admit this film is not for everyone, but if  you find that you are searching for a film with a bit more depth and are willing to think your way through this, it is well worth the effort and money.",5,Williams and his Oscar worthy performance,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,2190,"['Firstly', 'let', 'start', 'review', 'saying', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'everyone', 'get', 'do', ""n't"", 'as', 'simple', 'that.Robin', 'Williams', 'stunning', 'performance', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'sure', 'very', 'least', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'nod', 'Williams', 'Sy', 'Photo', 'Guy', 'discount', 'store', 'Sav-Mart', 'America', 'too', 'familiar', 'Sy', 'absolute', 'care', 'pride', 'work', 'point', 'obsession', 'altercation', 'photo', 'processing', 'technician', 'first', 'peak', 'just', 'how', 'seriously', 'Sy', 'work', 'Sy', 'obsessed', 'one', 'family', 'particular', 'dreams', 'becoming', 'part', 'family', 'Unlce', 'Sy', 'Seemingly', 'harmless', 'surface', 'find', 'film', 'Sy', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'harmless', 'one', 'would', 'think.In', 'opening', 'sequence', 'Sy', 'tale', 'customers', 'new', 'parent', 'endless', 'rolls', 'film', 'amatuer', 'pornographer', 'point', 'start', 'think', 'should', 'be', 'taking', 'film', 'same', 'place', 'be', 'developed', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'theatrical', 'debut', 'director', 'stunnng', 'camera', 'work', 'exceptional', 'enormous', 'glaring', 'halogen', 'staleness', 'Sav-Mart', 'drab', 'environment', 'Sy', 'home', 'warm', 'inviting', 'coloration', 'family', 'become', 'own', 'mind', 'important', 'figure', 'set', 'design', 'costumes', 'overall', 'look', 'feel', 'film', 'realistic', 'yet', 'moments', 'where', 'glaring', 'sterility', 'everyday', 'life', 'middle', 'aged', 'single', 'male', 'practically', 'face.Some', 'people', 'may', 'find', 'film', 'tad', 'slow', 'single', 'frame', 'neccessary', 'order', 'fully', 'develop', 'feeling', 'mood', 'characters', 'themselves.In', 'particular', 'ending', 'something', 'absoluetly', 'do', 'not', 'expect', 'give', 'couple', 'moments', 'think', 'will', 'become', 'very', 'clear', 'what', 'motivation', 'characters', 'screenwriter', 'director', 'was.I', 'admit', 'film', 'not', 'everyone', 'find', 'are', 'searching', 'film', 'bit', 'more', 'depth', 'are', 'willing', 'think', 'way', 'well', 'effort', 'money']",N/A

Hall,"[1, 2]","Sy Parrish is unusually enthusiastic about the job he has been doing for over 20 years, working in the photo lab of his local Savmart... the voiceover introduction we are given by him suggests an employee whose job is also his hobby. Unlike De Niro's character in Taxi Driver or Micheal Douglas in Falling Down, Sy does not seem to vent any of the unhappiness which comes through loneliness in his descriptions of the world he inhabits.There is no talk of deteriorating moral or national standards, instead Sy seems to accept the artificial world that Savmart is. He can identify with the company's high customer service ethics as he too feels strongly about processing peoples photos with care and affection, he describes with reverance his regular customers, especially the Yorkin family who he feels a part of. That is the life that is explained to us in voice-over narrative however the life we see is very far from pleasant and the visual style of the film communicates this perfectly. Savmart is as vernacular and washed-out as a modern prison, everything flares with a harsh, glaring whiteness - the director has created such atmosphere that you can almost smell the antiseptic on the floor. The customers mill around in the background like zombies as Robin Williams subtle acting conveys a middle-aged man who looks ill at ease.The crux of this story is his psychopathic fascination with the Yorkin family. He has taken duplicates of all their photos to keep for himself and has built a collage shrine of them over the years on the wall of his apartment. It is when we are shown a glimpse of this collage that we realise Sy's fixation is a sickness. When Sy loses his job over the unaccounted for prints that he has taken of the Yorkins his obsession begins to manifest itself as he becomes a dangerous stalker.

So I rented this movie based on its plot, and without any consideration for the cast.I must say that Williams really shines in this movie as I have never seen him before.  In Hook, What Dreams May Come, and Dead Poets Society, there was a hint of that dramatic core hidden beneath the childlike flippancy of the movies that are great hits with the younger set.  But in this movie, Williams puts on a stellar performance, demanding that you feel something for him, about him, and possibly about yourself.The best part of this film is that it is not a knife-and-dagger, grotesque, blood-all-over thriller, but the psychological kind -- the type that leaves you thinking about it afterward, and yet, feeling intense emotions for the poor soul Sy the Photo Guy.  Every person has more than one dimension, even people who we might not consider normal.  But what is normal, anyway?  Everybody has a different defining line for that term.

Robin Williams, whose comedies are nothing short of loathsome, takes us into dark territory very believably. Mark Romanek wrote and directed, and obviously knew what he was doing in every shot and with every angle. The writing is superb.Creepy is a word that is easily brought to mind, almost too easily, by this movie. This is partly do to the movie's understated style. We nod our heads, because we've encountered people like this. Sy ""the photo guy"" is not an ogre, is not unintelligent, and has his own peculiar compassion for people. This makes it easy to empathize with Sy, and pity him, even as he concocts his despicable and pathetic strategies to insinuate himself into the lives of the Yorkins. When we watch him methodically eating and watching the Simpsons, just barely existing, there's something of an accusation directed at us watchers as well. Sy's obvious alienation from society, and his inner sterility, seem even more genuine with his dutiful participation in and obedience to the bankrupted, valueless and commodified civilization embodied by the SAVEMart, and maintained by the petty and bureaucratic manager (Gary Cole). Romaneck almost takes the manager character towards stereotype, by with Cole even it rises above two-dimensionality.Sy casts himself in the role of protector, as a sort of unbidden defender of human value and values, transcending his own mediocrity by--I suppose--denying it. The delusional grandiosity of this role is even more sad if we have to believe that Sy's dysfunctionality is the only reason he gives a damn. What does that say?The melodrama of a Hitchcock is absent here. The aesthetic violence of Scorcese's ritualistic TAXI DRIVER also isn't to be found. ONE HOUR PHOTO is most poignant in a main character who is everywhere today in our society. He's easy to understand because we've encountered people like this. The alienated and socially dysfunctional, who are unable to form relationships, respect boundaries, and understand intimacy are all too frequent. The near sympathy with which he's treated in the movie, and protrayed by it, may help us to be able to recognize and maybe address it somewhat in our lives.A movie that is a clear forerunner, and I think influenced Romaneck, is Coppola's 1974 THE CONVERSATION, starring Gene Hackman, a sort of commentary on the Watergate era. It most closely compares to ONE HOUR PHOTO. Hackman is superb as Harry Caul, whose inner world is a contentless vacuum, yet guarded with obsessive paranoia (Kafka's allegorical story, ""The Burrow,"" explores this kind of existence). Isolation and paranoia morally hamstring the protaganist, yet guides his obsession when he suddenly decides to act as a moral agent. The conclusion of that movie is extraordinary.",4,"""I just took pictures""",1086393600,"06 5, 2004",2004,2793,"['very', 'very', 'impressive', 'film', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'comedies', 'are', 'nothing', 'short', 'loathsome', 'dark', 'territory', 'very', 'believably', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'wrote', 'directed', 'obviously', 'knew', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'shot', 'angle', 'writing', 'superb.Creepy', 'word', 'easily', 'brought', 'mind', 'almost', 'too', 'easily', 'movie', 'partly', 'do', 'movie', 'understated', 'style', 'nod', 'heads', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'people', 'Sy', 'photo', 'guy', 'not', 'ogre', 'not', 'unintelligent', 'own', 'peculiar', 'compassion', 'people', 'easy', 'empathize', 'Sy', 'pity', 'even', 'despicable', 'pathetic', 'strategies', 'insinuate', 'lives', 'Yorkins', 'When', 'watch', 'methodically', 'eating', 'watching', 'Simpsons', 'just', 'barely', 'existing', 'something', 'accusation', 'directed', 'watchers', 'as', 'well', 'Sy', 'obvious', 'alienation', 'society', 'inner', 'sterility', 'seem', 'even', 'more', 'genuine', 'dutiful', 'participation', 'obedience', 'bankrupted', 'valueless', 'commodified', 'civilization', 'embodied', 'SAVEMart', 'maintained', 'petty', 'bureaucratic', 'manager', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'Romaneck', 'almost', 'manager', 'character', 'towards', 'stereotype', 'Cole', 'even', 'two-dimensionality.Sy', 'casts', 'role', 'protector', 'sort', 'unbidden', 'defender', 'human', 'value', 'values', 'transcending', 'own', 'mediocrity', 'suppose', 'denying', 'delusional', 'grandiosity', 'role', 'even', 'more', 'sad', 'have', 'believe', 'Sy', 'dysfunctionality', 'only', 'reason', 'damn', 'What', 'say', 'melodrama', 'Hitchcock', 'absent', 'here', 'aesthetic', 'violence', 'Scorcese', 'ritualistic', 'TAXI', 'DRIVER', 'also', ""n't"", 'be', 'found', 'ONE', 'HOUR', 'PHOTO', 'most', 'poignant', 'main', 'character', 'who', 'everywhere', 'today', 'society', 'easy', 'understand', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'people', 'alienated', 'socially', 'dysfunctional', 'who', 'are', 'unable', 'form', 'relationships', 'respect', 'boundaries', 'understand', 'intimacy', 'are', 'too', 'frequent', 'near', 'sympathy', 'treated', 'movie', 'protrayed', 'may', 'help', 'be', 'able', 'recognize', 'maybe', 'address', 'somewhat', 'lives.A', 'movie', 'clear', 'forerunner', 'think', 'influenced', 'Romaneck', 'Coppola', '1974', 'THE', 'CONVERSATION', 'starring', 'Gene', 'Hackman', 'sort', 'commentary', 'Watergate', 'era', 'most', 'closely', 'ONE', 'HOUR', 'PHOTO', 'Hackman', 'superb', 'Harry', 'Caul', 'inner', 'world', 'contentless', 'vacuum', 'yet', 'guarded', 'obsessive', 'paranoia', 'Kafka', 'allegorical', 'story', 'Burrow', 'kind', 'existence', 'Isolation', 'paranoia', 'morally', 'hamstring', 'protaganist', 'yet', 'obsession', 'when', 'suddenly', 'act', 'moral', 'agent', 'conclusion', 'movie', 'extraordinary']",N/A

But outside of the store his life is unspeakably dull, and lonely.

The first hour, which includes a few nice cinematic touches (Romanek is clearly a Kubric fundi), do not make up for a narrative which would most probably have fared better as a back story to 'NYPD Blue', or some such vacuous t.v. confection. Williams, although stellar, has not performed quite as much of an about face as many critics have suggested. Instead, he plays up all of those persona traits we have come to expect from him; the nervous glances, the supplicated need for acceptance from the audience.

Having no life outside of his work, Sy compensates his isolation by becoming attached to the Yorkin family for whom he develops film: He becomes obsessed with being part of their life as he sees it through the prism of his work; he imagines how happy he would be as the family's Uncle Sy and how good he would be to them. His obsession begins to grow as he starts stalking the family members, photographing them, and trespassing into their home. His fantasy is soon shattered when he sees that photos are only a snap shot of family life and that there are ugly sides of married life that are never included in the photo album: false expectations, mundane routine, dissatisfaction, and of course, infidelity.The film does a great job in setting up the scenes to show the bland and montonous life of Sy. His empty life just blends in with the neat generic shelves and products of the supermarket he works in. The film brilliantly shows that theme unfolds in Sy's private life and how his neurotic attempts at breaking out of his routine soon become psychotic. Robin Williams played his role surprisingly well. The acting by Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan as Nina and Will Yorkin was nothing special however.The problem with the film is that it takes almost all of its time in building suspense and leading the audience to think that Sy is a demonic killer. Instead, the ending is as bland as Sy's character in that he ends up being nothing more than a harmless peeper who went a little overboard instead of the predatory stalker the film prepared us for. Perhaps the writer and director thought that they were being clever but, ultimately, the joke is on them given the box-office results of this film. They shouldn't have been surprised; they got exactly the same response from the audience as the feeling they sought to evoke with the end of the film: an unimpressive anti-climax.I have trouble recommending this film to rent as there isn't much to see in this film afterall; again, all of this suspense is frustratingly brought to nothing of an ending.

But that's okay.  This film is just fine on it's own.  It brings us the lonely life of a photoprint shop employee (before those digital cameras took over almost completely) and stalker portrayed by Robin Williams.  While a number of Mr. Williams's films have been criticized for going over the top with his humor and improvs, but this film isn't one of them.  Oh, I'm sure that there are improvs in there (it's, after all, Robin Williams), but whereever they are, they blend in and work.  It was also nice to see someone take pride in his work, even if you find him creepy.  Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen, and Dylan Smith did a great job in their roles as a Norman Rockwell-like family that is hiding plenty of problems and issues underneath...I did find it weird that the mother was so ready to pray for the photo guy...I don't know my photo guy that well.  I also liked Gary Cole as the store manager, especially in any scenes where he laid down the law...shut up, Mr. Cole!  Can't you see that Robin Williams is busy stalking people?  He doesn't have time to do things the way you want them done!  But Gary Cole doesn't let up, and I like him even more for it.  Now, if only I could have seen more of Paul H. Kim as Robin Williams's co-worker/""apprentice"".  Here is both a character and an actor who have obvious potiencial but are not being turned loose.

If you look at the photos on the wall.... of the family he supposedly developed pictures for.... you can tell he is not on the same level of reality.  It was more of a depressing film. We see him eventually go to jail because he couldn't control his rage at the father of this family who went out and had an affair. I just find it hard to believe that someone along the way didn't know that he was the victim of abuse.To me it was unrealistic in a sense that no one saw his wall of photos.

Sy takes great pride in his work and knows all of his customers, their addresses, the  type of pictures they take, how many prints they want, the size of print, etc.  However, he is so lonely that over the years he has become obsessed with a family who has been developing their pictures with him for 9 years or so.

Earning their trust, Sy secretly makes extra copies of all their photos for himself and begins to stalks them. At times, Sy's actions are so uncomfortable to watch you can't help but squirm in your seat. You don't want to watch anymore, yet can't tear your eyes from the screen. Williams nails this performance, even surpassing his role in Good Will Hunting, which earned him an Oscar.Although the end of the film degrades a bit by replacing much of the suspense with routine action and over explaining things in the resolution, it still maintains an edge over many other suspense films.

This is one of the key lines that Robin Williams tells us, in the opening of ""One Hour Photo"", the new thriller from screenwriter-director Mark Romanek (who is famous for directing many music videos).The story revolves around Sy, the photo processing clerk (played remarkably by Robin Williams), who leads a very dull. Eventually, he alienates himself and starts imagining himself as a member of the Yorkin family, a seemingly perfect family, who have brought their photos to him over the years. He has developed their photos over the years and knows everything about them. Sy uses them as a escape from his dull life and appoints himself as Uncle Sy, a caring loving member of the family. However, when something goes wrong in the family that Sy finds out about, he goes about his way to see that the person is punished.Robin Williams characterization of ""Sy, the Photo Guy"" is brilliant; a chilling, eerie, humanizing and many-layered portrait of a deeply disturbed individual. Although, it gives a negative effect for Sy, you can't help but feel sorry for him, as he is not a bad person in any way, but because of his significant psychopathology, he looks at things a different way. To me, he ending is not too flat or anti-climatic either, which made me appreciate the storyline of the movie even more.All in all, this is definitely a good movie to watch.",5,Another extraordinary performance by Mr.Robin Williams!,1031616000,"09 10, 2002",2002,1426,"['one', 'ever', 'photograph', 'something', 'want', 'forget', 'one', 'key', 'lines', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'opening', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'new', 'thriller', 'screenwriter-director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'who', 'famous', 'directing', 'many', 'music', 'videos', '.The', 'story', 'revolves', 'Sy', 'photo', 'processing', 'clerk', 'played', 'remarkably', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'very', 'dull', 'Eventually', 'imagining', 'member', 'Yorkin', 'family', 'seemingly', 'perfect', 'family', 'who', 'have', 'brought', 'photos', 'years', 'developed', 'photos', 'years', 'everything', 'Sy', 'escape', 'dull', 'life', 'appoints', 'Uncle', 'Sy', 'caring', 'loving', 'member', 'family', 'However', 'when', 'something', 'wrong', 'family', 'Sy', 'out', 'about', 'way', 'see', 'person', 'punished.Robin', 'Williams', 'characterization', 'Sy', 'Photo', 'Guy', 'brilliant', 'chilling', 'eerie', 'humanizing', 'many-layered', 'portrait', 'deeply', 'disturbed', 'individual', 'negative', 'effect', 'Sy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'feel', 'sorry', 'not', 'bad', 'person', 'way', 'significant', 'psychopathology', 'things', 'different', 'way', 'ending', 'not', 'too', 'flat', 'anti-climatic', 'either', 'made', 'appreciate', 'storyline', 'movie', 'even', 'more.All', 'definitely', 'good', 'movie', 'watch']",N/A

It is an unusual but interesting subject matter viewed through the perspective of a voyeuristic photo-processor.  We know little about the past of Seymour (played by Robin Williams).  We just know that he is a perfectionist manager of a one-hour photo processing unit and he has a fixation on a particular family.  The wife/mother of this family takes a lot of pictures of her son, husband and herself.  She brings them to Seymour (nicknamed ""Sy"") for processing.  Sy has developed an obsession on this family as a result of what he sees in their pictures.  Presumably he sees a world of love, peace, tranquility, order, and stability which is, apparrently, something he has not experienced in his life.  We know something is wrong right from the start of the movie because we first meet Sy at the police station where he is being interviewed by a couple of detectives.  They want to know why he did what he did.  Sy tells the story and we go through the bulk of the movie not knowing what he did.  As we learn more about Sy's obsession, we start to get ideas.  The movie floats in and out of reality just enough to keep us off balance without confusing us.  Throughout the movie there are numerous symbols of order.  Perhaps the most obvious symbols of order are the frequent scenes of immacculately stocked shelfs at the ""SavMart"" where Sy works.  There is an abundance of color throughout the movie as well which I presume to be some sort of connection to the photo-processing setting.Sy eventually discovers trouble in paradise and his world begins to collapse.  The order, love and stability turns out to be false and Sy decides that he must punish the transgressor.  Let's leave it at that and you can find out for yourself how it ends.I saw Robin Williams in an earlier movie where he played a serious role.  I was not impressed with his preformance then and I was doubtful about what I would find in this movie.  I'm happy to say that Williams did a very good job in his role.  That's good because his character was 75% of the movie.  I'm glad I saw this movie and I reccommend it to others with the stipulation that it had earned its' ""R"" rating.

725409,A2H9UO8RYFX5MB,B00007976T,"Rich Stoehr ""Idle Rich""","[12, 12]","Right up front: I'm a fan of Robin Williams. I think he's a comic genius and a fine actor to boot.With this in mind, I pretty much expected to enjoy &quot;One-Hour Photo.&quot; I thought it could be an challenging role for Williams, and it had been a while since I really saw him stretch himself much. I didn't really know what to expect from the film as a whole, though. I was very pleasantly surprised.&quot;One-Hour Photo&quot; is one of those atmospheric films that seem to happen by chance every now and again, happy accidents of mood and observation that seem almost accidentally skillful, but most likely are good by design. The director, in a DVD commentary, expresses the fact that one of the motivating themes behind the style of the film was a fascination with the massive discount store chains that have spread rapidly across America in the last couple of decades. It's a thematic element which shows through in almost every scene, most especially in the expansive, clean shots of the store interior, and mirrored in the ordered simplicity of the decoration and furnishings in Williams' character's house. By contrast, other locations seem complex, chaotic, even messy.Another impressive element of the film is the use of color. Early on, in a bit of narration, Williams' photo clerk describes his disdain for the work of most one-hour photo labs, criticizing them for prints which are too dark or too light, or in which the color is improperly balanced. In another scene, later, Williams gets into a loud argument with a technician about a slight blue shift in the photo processing machine he uses. Williams speaks with pride of the care he takes in getting colors perfect in his prints. This immediately made me start looking for color and light cues in the film itself, and there are many to find. One of the few places where color and light seem perfect are within the store where Williams works. The store is clean, well-lit, reds are perfectly red and blues (such as on the vests store employees wear) are perfectly blue. However, when Williams steps outside the store, light becomes too yellow or too blue. The only exceptions to this are when he is in his own home, or when he is looking into the home of the family he has been stalking. In a most striking scene, Williams is sitting out in his car, looking into their house. Everything is perfectly-lit there, and colors look right. However, outside its too dark, and blues are stronger then other shades. In the final scenes of the film, as it comes to its denouement, color becomes washed out, lights too bright, as Williams' understanding of this perfect family becomes increasingly fractured. Color plays an important part in the film. Considering that it's about a man who develops photos for a living, why would it not?Stylistically, I enjoyed the overall visual tone of &quot;One-Hour Photo.&quot; It's atmosphere is somehow both antiseptic and creepy. The few truly shocking moments in the film are made all the more so by their contrast to the movie overall. Like a Stanley Kubrick film, One-Hour Photo uses a strong sense of order to highlight the chaos. A dream sequence near the end of the film, in which a comparison to Kubrick is even more apt, uses this in a most remarkable and truly surprising way.It's Williams himself who's the real treat in the film, though. This is a man who has spent much of his career either making us laugh or making us feel empathy for his character. In this role, more even than in Insomnia, he abandons all of that. Somehow, the man who was so open and likable in other films becomes a closed door. While watching One-Hour Photo, I forgot very quickly that he was Robin Williams, as he allowed his usual persona to be completely subsumed by that of the character. Even his narration sounds almost completely unlike what we are used to hearing from him. Gone is the bright, animated voice of Aladdin's genie or the warm voice employed for &quot;What Dreams May Come.&quot; He's calm and quiet and cold, until he gets a little bit excited. Then he becomes nervous and jumpy. His pathetic attempts to be a part of something he can't attain for himself make him simultaneously pitiful and creepy. He has a distance in this film that is rare for any actor, most especially Robin Williams. Though he is in almost every scene, one is left with a feeling at the end of the film that we do not know him - perhaps that we cannot know him.The end of the film was also a pleasant surprise, in that it goes against most established Hollywood standards of moralizing and defies expectations. Without giving any specifics away, I can say that one comes away from the film wanting to make a solid moral judgment on some of the characters, but there is no way to do so. There's no easy answers, it seems to say in the end. There's no excuse here to finally pass judgment on this or that character, only more questions, most of which will never be answered. The implicit challenge to the audience to draw their own conclusions about the characters (or even more challenging, to keep an open mind about them all), is what makes &quot;One-Hour Photo&quot; a great film in the final analysis.",5,"An effective, stylistic thriller... and Williams is amazing",1064448000,"09 25, 2003",2003,5187,"['Right', 'up', 'front', ""'m"", 'fan', 'Robin', 'Williams',

Robin Williams plays a man who has worked at a one-hour photo lab in a sterile, Walgreen's like department store that seems to have very few customers.  He's obviously good at his job, but his skills have fallen on hard times as his obsession with one particular family (and their photos) begins to consume him.  He keeps their pictures on his wall at home, and we truly sees himself as a beloved member of their family.  When his illusions about the family are shattered, he snaps in a dangerous way.Williams is well-suited to the role.  He underplays the role, and this reigning-in of his natural ""over-the-top"" nature gives his character a subtext of roiling emotions just waiting to bubble over.When he does finally snap, even his ""revenge"" is stunted and ineffective.  This man is professional loser.  The movie is well-written enough so that we feel a mixture of sympathy and disgust for this character.  If we hated him completely, then there would be no reason to see the movie.  If we totally sympathized with him, his collapse would be far to difficult to take.Gary Cole plays Williams' boss in a spin on the character he played to comic effect in OFFICE SPACE.  Here he emerges as the true villain, and Cole is excellent.  He's a very underrated performer.Connie Nielsen (GLADIATOR, THE HUNTED) is convincing as the mother in Williams' adoptive family.  She is a mature actress who deserves more high-profile roles.The movie has lots of humor as well, and in many ways is a satire of the cold, sterile retail-centric world we live in, and how easy it is for a shy person to get swallowed up in the impersonal-ness of it all.  Yet on another level, it's a ""psycho"" movie that sometimes feels a bit familiar and obvious...we've seen so many psychos by now!!  But the performances make it well above average.

725411,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00007976T,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 1]","One Hour Photo (Mark Romanek, 2002)Mark Romanek&#65533;s second feature film (following 1985 indie Static), One Hour Photo was released to almost universal accolades, then found itself skunked at the Oscars. Critics around the country expressed confusion and outrage. Everyone wanted to know why.One Hour Photo is the story of Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams), a clerk at the local superstore who develops photographs. He has developed an unhealthy obsession with the Yorkin family: father Will (Michael Vartan of the TV series Alias), mother Nina (Connie Nielsen of Gladiator), and son Jake (Dylan Smith, seen more recently in Pirates of the Caribbean).Therein lies the problem: laid out like that, you can see exactly where this is going. And while it&#65533;s a good stalker tale, it never rises above just being a stalker tale. Even when Parrish is trying to do the right thing by the family, the scenes (and the emotions within them) could be from any of twenty other stalker movies. We&#65533;ve seen it all before, and while the production quality and the acting is certainly above the caliber of your average Lifetime Original Movie, the underlying plot, theme, and message are right in the zone.Williams, like all gifted comic actors, does have the chops to play the psychotic, and shows them here well. But in order to truly shine, he&#65533;ll need better material; his two forays into it so far (the other being Chris Nolan&#65533;s execrable remake of Insomnia) have been hampered by bad script choice. In fact, it seems everyone in involved with this film, from Romanek right down to steadicam operator Elizabeth Ziegler (the last name in the credits), is capable of better. There are huge amounts of potential from every direction in this film; they just never manage to coalesce.That said, as I inferred above, as an example of the stalker-film genre, it&#65533;s not bad by any means. All the main performances are credible, with the arguable exception of Gary Cole, who plays Parrish&#65533;s boss. He&#65533;s a bit two &#65533;I&#65533;m the evil upper management guy&#65533; two-dimensional. The pacing is a little uneven, but once the ball gets rolling, it works well enough.

FOREMAN,"[0, 0]","Let me begin by saying that I really looked forward to seeing this movie, I'm a big fan of Robin Williams (despite his questionable, at best, choices of roles to play), and I really enjoyed the first 90+ minutes of this movie.  I expected more at the end.  A bigger payoff.  A surprise.  A complication.  Something.  It just kind of ended.  Maybe I would have complained if it have been some kind of contrived, unrealistic fantastic conclusion, but I think the writer could have come up with something more.  Maybe not.Williams was spectacular--one of the creepiest performances in my recent movie-viewing history.  The cinematography and costuming were excellent--great use of color (or the lack thereof) to symbolize the &quot;ordinariness&quot; of Sy's life.  OK supporting roles--nobody spectacularly good or bad.  The idea for the story and the plot itself are extremely creative and clever (the wall of pictures in Sy's house is one of the more disturbing non-violent images in recent memory, as well).  It just doesn't come together well enough for me at the end, which cost it a five-star rating for me.  The buildup to the climax was steady, logical, and progressive.  Then it ends. . . .  I don't mind a &quot;head-scratcher,&quot; as long as it is for &quot;thinking&quot; reasons (i.e., MEMENTO, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, etc.)--everything doesn't have to be tied up in a thoughtless package with a pretty bow for me.  With that much anticipation, though, the script writer needed to come up with an ending that is worthy of that anticipation.

725413,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00007976T,Roland E. Zwick,"[8, 9]","Robin Williams gives what may well be the performance of his career in ""One Hour Photo,"" a creepy psychological thriller written and directed with cool precision by Mark Romanek.  Given its premise, the film could easily have degenerated into a sordid, exploitative tale of obsession and madness.  Instead, Romanek has chosen to take a more subtle approach, fashioning a film that downplays the potential violence of its material while, at the same time, recognizing the humanity of its central figure.Romanek understands that the greatest threats to our safety and lives often come from the gray, nondescript people who surround us unnoticed, the ""nobodies"" whose benign faces and vacuous smiles reveal no trace of the insanity, evil and potential for doing us harm that may be lurking right there under the surface.  And nobody is ""grayer"" than Si Parrish, an innocuous, socially undeveloped milquetoast who spends his days working as a photo developer in one of those sterile five-and-dime drug stores (just like the one in ""The Good Girl"") - and his nights sitting all alone in his drab apartment brooding over a massive family-photo shrine he has erected to the Yorkins, a seemingly happy family of three whose pictures Si has been developing, copying and obsessing over for more than seven years now.  The film centers around Si's growing fixation with this one family and his delusional belief that he too could somehow become an integral part of their family unit.  Then comes the day when Si realizes that he is no longer content to be a mere vicarious member of this adopted family and, thus, begins his plan to gradually insinuate himself more and more directly into their lives.As both writer and director, Romanek manages to keep us in a state of vague uneasiness throughout.  We are always anticipating some potentially dreadful event, yet Romanek doesn't go for the easy thrill or the obvious plot turn.  Thanks to Williams' subtle, incisive performance, we come to understand something of what makes this strange character tick.  We begin to sense the deep-seated loneliness and social awkwardness that have come to play such an important part in defining both his behavior and his character.  Si is scary, but he is also pathetic.  He may have slipped over the edge into madness, but it is a pathology rooted in overwhelming loneliness and the inability to ""fit in"" to the societal ""norm"" of marriage and family. Even when his character is at his most threatening and irrational, Williams somehow makes us care about him.Romanek hits upon a few ancillary themes as well.  He acknowledges how photos create the appearance of a life without necessarily reflecting the reality of that life.  Most people, Si confesses, record only the ""special, happy"" moments of their lives - birthdays, weddings, holidays etc. and leave out the mundane or painful ones.  Moreover, Si tells us that people use pictures as a way of defeating aging and time, of saying to the world of the future that ""I"", this seemingly insignificant person, was really here, being happy and enjoying life.  To match this theme, Romanek's visual style often feels like the director's own personal homage to The Photograph, as the camera scans caressingly across a sea of snapshots - and Si's voiceover narration complements that feeling.""One Hour Photo"" is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem.  It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.",4,"subtle, unsettling glimpse of insanity",1033257600,"09 29, 2002",2002,3576,"['Robin', 'Williams', 'what', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'performance', 'career', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'creepy', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'written', 'directed', 'cool', 'precision', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'Given', 'premise', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'degenerated', 'sordid', 'exploitative', 'tale', 'obsession', 'madness', 'Instead', 'Romanek', 'chosen', 'take', 'more', 'subtle', 'approach', 'fashioning', 'film', 'potential', 'violence', 'material', 'same', 'time', 'recognizing', 'humanity', 'central', 'figure.Romanek', 'understands', 'greatest', 'threats', 'safety', 'lives', 'often', 'come', 'gray', 'nondescript', 'people', 'who', 'surround', 'unnoticed', 'nobodies', 'benign', 'vacuous', 'smiles', 'reveal', 'trace', 'insanity', 'evil', 'potential', 'doing', 'harm', 'may', 'be', 'lurking', 'right', 'surface', 'nobody', 'grayer', 'Si', 'Parrish', 'innocuous', 'socially', 'undeveloped', 'milquetoast', 'who', 'days', 'working', 'photo', 'developer', 'one', 'sterile', 'five-and-dime', 'drug', 'stores', 'just', 'one', 'Good', 'Girl', 'nights', 'sitting', 'alone', 'drab', 'apartment', 'brooding', 'massive', 'family-photo', 'shrine', 'erected', 'Yorkins', 'seemingly', 'happy', 'family', 'three', 'pictures', 'Si', 'been', 'developing', 'copying', 'obsessing', 'more', 'seven', 'years', 'now', 'film', 'centers', 'Si', 'growing', 'fixation', 'one', 'family', 'delusional', 'belief', 'too', 'could', 'somehow', 'become', 'integral', 'part', 'family', 'unit', 'Then', 'day', 'when', 'Si', 'no', 'longer', 'content', 'be', 'mere', 'vicarious', 'member', 'adopted', 'family', 'thus', 'plan', 'gradually', 'insinuate', 'more', 'more', 'directly', 'lives.As', 'writer', 'director', 'Romanek', 'keep', 'state', 'vague', 'uneasiness', 'are', 'always', 'anticipating', 'potentially', 'dreadful', 'event', 'yet', 'Romanek', ""n't"", 'go', 'easy', 'thrill', 'obvious', 'plot', 'turn', 'Thanks', 'Williams', 'subtle', 'incisive', 'performance', 'come', 'understand', 'something', 'what', 'strange', 'character', 'tick', 'begin', 'sense', 'deep-seated', 'loneliness', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'have', 'come', 'play', 'important', 'part', 'defining', 'behavior', 'character', 'Si', 'scary', 'also', 'pathetic', 'may', 'have', 'slipped', 'edge', 'madness', 'pathology', 'rooted', 'overwhelming', 'loneliness', 'inability', 'fit', 'societal', 'norm', 'marriage', 'family', 'Even', 'when', 'character', 'most', 'threatening', 'irrational', 'Williams', 'somehow', 'care', 'him.Romanek', 'hits', 'few', 'ancillary', 'themes', 'as', 'well', 'how', 'photos', 'create', 'appearance', 'life', 'necessarily', 'reflecting', 'reality', 'life', 'Most', 'people', 'Si', 'record', 'only', 'special', 'happy', 'moments', 'lives', 'birthdays', 'weddings', 'holidays', 'etc', 'leave', 'out', 'mundane', 'painful', 'ones', 'Moreover', 'Si', 'people', 'use', 'pictures', 'way', 'defeating', 'aging', 'time', 'saying', 'world', 'future', 'seemingly', 'insignificant', 'person', 'was', 'really', 'here', 'being', 'happy', 'enjoying', 'life', 'match', 'theme', 'Romanek', 'visual', 'style', 'often', 'director', 'own', 'personal', 'homage', 'Photograph', 'camera', 'caressingly', 'sea', 'snapshots', 'Si', 'voiceover', 'narration', 'complements', 'feeling', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'not', 'film', 'who', 'like', 'chills', 'heavily', 'laced', 'bloodshed', 'murder', 'mayhem', 'rather', 'who', 'can', 'appreciate', 'quietly', 'unsettling', 'yet', 'strangely', 'compassionate', 'glimpse', 'dark', 'recesses', 'troubled', 'mind']",N/A

The movie is rather simple at first glance. A enjoyable suspenseful thriller. It wasnt until subsequent viewings that I treated this movie like an onion (not in a bad way!) with numerous layers and noticing things I didn't notice any other times. Even my most recent time watching it I noticed more little things that helped me understand Sy more and it was because of these things it has made me grow to love and appreciate this movie.The plot is simple for anyone who hasn't heard of the movies before.

No friends, no family, no life and on one who cares about him...except the little boy Jake, the son of the family he obsesses about. When the Man of the House is caught fooling around with another woman, Sy is outraged; HIS family is threatened, and must be avenged. His world is one of sterility and loneliness; there is nothing to alleviate or relieve this man, he dwells in a Hell on Earth, comprised of a lonely apartment, a lonely job and a lonely life; always on the outside looking in. It is, IMHO, the finest work of Williams's career, right up there with Dead Poet's Society...this man can do anything, literally, and this is his tour de force.

725420,A1C58YXM2A30CY,B00007976T,"Scotman's Film & Book Reviews ""Film & Book Re...","[2, 2]","I've been a bit hesitant about comedians taking on serious roles (Jim Carrey for one) that don't really hit it off for me.  However, Robin Williams got his character down cold as one Sy Parrish.  Sy has been working at SavMart for 14 years developing film for his customers, admiring their photos, getting into their lives -- and even making copies for himself to place on his wall!I like stories that start at the end and work through to the end again.  We have Sy in the county slammer, looks so white and antiseptic.  All white, but for a red chair.  He explains to the detective the whys and hows of what he's done.Director Mark Robenek does a fascinating job with photography -- the little, lonely man is so bland and chameleon, that he blends in to every scene he plays.  The blue & white uniform blends in with the store hallways; the beige jacket blends with the cars and the walls.We first get a hint that the lonely man has a volcano burning inside when he gets a crack in his car's windshield: ""Great, now what?""Several themes for this film struck me:  the photos we take are of the happy times; we rarely shoot the sad times.  The photo is a fraction of a second, frozen in time.  As the film says, it's our urge to stop time.Sy Parrish though lonely and afraid of reality, knows he could never accomplish what the Yorkin family has and starts stalking them.  He imagines he is one of the family, walking around in their house, admiring their TVs and large house.  He even meets their nine year old son and promises to talk to his coach for treating him roughly.But when he ""just happens"" to leave photos of infidelity into Mrs. Yorkin's photo stack, things really start coming apart for Sy.My only criticism of the film is that it starts off slow and stays in neutral mode for quite some time, spends too much time in exposition and not enough in action.  But it's a thriller, a mental game if you will, so the viewer may appreciate this type of film at face value.I'll be looking for more Robin Williams' serious side.

Smith,"[11, 13]","Those of us that live in the suburbs know that, a few miles away, we will find one or more of those huge chain retail outlets, a place we can go to shop for everything we need.  While we're there, we might drop off a roll or two of film to be processed.  Unknowingly, perhaps thinking the whole process is done via computer, we don't realize that the technician developing the prints might actually be looking those prints over, an invisible eye to our private moments.  That's the premise of Mark Romanek's chilling &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot;Robin Williams is Sy Parrish, a photo technician for one of those large nameless stores.  He's polite, friendly, and knows many of his customers by name.  Over the years he's become particularly fond of the Yorkin family: Will (played by Michael vartan), the handsome father and husband; Nina (Connie Nielson), the beautiful mother and wife, who over the years has come to know Sy; and son Jake (Dylan Smith), who also likes Sy, and is sad in his belief that Sy is lonely and has no friends.We've all seen the manic Robin in many of his comedies, improvising like crazy, not really playing a character, just another version of himself.  In &quot;One Hour Photo,&quot; Williams takes that manic energy and stuffs it inside, and he becomes Sy the Photo Guy, no longer Robin Williams.  It's a chilling performance.  Sy is indeed friendless.  Lonely and depressed, he eats his meals alone and returns home to his tiny, empty apartment.Sy has done some decorating: one wall is covered with photos of the Yorkins.  Over the years, Sy has made a set of prints for himself every time the  Yorkins bring something in to be developed.  And over the years he's become fixated on what he thinks, via the photographs, is a perfect family.  He imagines himself as a part of the family, &quot;Uncle Sy,&quot; and his fixation is now turning to obsession.&quot;One Hour Photo&quot; is writer/director Mark Romanek's first film.  Like many directors, his work over the years has primarily been in music video.  He also directed Johnny Cash's heartbreaking video of &quot;Hurt,&quot; which conveyed an overwhelming sense of heartbreak and dispair.Romanek is some kind of genius for getting the performance out of Williams that he did.  It's an amazing transformation.The last third of the movie has Sy's world tumbling down around him: he loses his job and has discovered a piece of information on his &quot;adopted&quot; family that finally drives him over the edge into near madness.The movie ends with many questions unanswered.  There is no nice and tidy Hollywood ending where all problems are resolved.  We, the audience, must now try to make sense of what has happened.  It's a film that will stay with you long after the end credits roll.DVD highlights:-- Commentary track with Robin Williams and Mark Romanek.  Apparently this is the first time ever that Williams has recorded a commentary track for one of his films.  The two have a good rapport, and while the commentary lags in places, we do get a glimpse into the &quot;real&quot; Robin Williams.

Every scene, to this film fan's eyes, seemed to have meticulously crafted mise-en-scene (in sum: setup) to contrast the bleakness of the main character Sy's life with the lushness and color of the family he becomes obsessed with.Naturally, the movie revolves around photographs, with several profound lines spoken about them towards the latter half of the film.  Even the colors of the scenes feel well chosen to bring out the full feeling of depth good photography holds.  The sterility of Sy's world is made abundantly clear by the well chosen techniques of the director.Fans of Hitchcock will find much rewarding material here, as every prolonged silence shot of the main character (marvelously acted by Robin Williams in another experimental role) reveals the teeming rainbow of angst behind the eyes of the friendly neighborhood photo guy as he spirals out of control.  And in the end, we are told (rather abruptly, and the one thing i would have modified about the film) why Sy is obsessed with photographs.There is no over the top butchery like at the end of Taxi Driver, but it lends a dab of wonderment and even sympathy to the curious old man's character.In conclusion, this film is more of a character study than an in your face thriller, but is nevertheless a fantastic feature debut from writer/director Mark Romanek.

He develops photos for a living and latches onto one family - and their photos - as an inspiration for his fantasies.  This particular family makes him happy because they seem to be perfect; in his fantasies he pretends that he's the beloved uncle of the family, and that they love him and invite him to their house.Personally when I was watching the movie I felt such a gut-wrenching sadness for the Williams character, especially when his world falls apart and he sees into the supposed perfection of his fantasy family.

However I'll concede he has made some some turkeys in his time!'One Hour Photo' is something completely different. Williams plays Sy, a photo technician in a large store. He's a loner who leads a pretty sad life and who gradully becomes obessed with a family who he regularly develops photos for.The film develops quickly and there isn't really a wasted minute. Its well scripted, and directed with some style by Mark Romanek. This is a great example to many Hollywood filmmakers of what can be acheived through character development, rather than the unneccessary use of CGI special effects.At only 91 minutes in length this is film that in many ways stands up to comparison with Alfred Hitchcocks work.

725435,A2UW83R0JOZZ6,B00007976T,S. Schell,"[1, 2]","There are many films that delve into the mind of psychotics - some of the better known psychopaths in film history are Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960), Dr. Hannibal Lecter of Jonathan Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) and Patrick Bateman of Mary Harron's ""American Psycho"" (2000).  Now comes a sleeper from director Mark Romanek called ""One Hour Photo"" that presents us with an all-new breed of lunatic - he's the type that even mindful people least suspect.Meet Seymour Parrish (Williams), better known to his co-workers as Sy, who works in the photo lab of a Wal-Mart-type department store prosaically dubbed Sav-Mart.  Day in and day out, Sy takes roll after roll of film, developing each with a sense of pride and an incentive for high quality.  Most of what comes to life in the dark room are images of birthday parties, weddings, anniversaries, vacations and the occasional amateur pornography.  But of all his regular customers, there is one in particular who fascinates him the most.  Nina Yorkin (Nielsen), who makes a drop-off nearly every other week at Sav-Mart's photo lab, has a picturesque existence - Will (Vartan), her handsome husband with a five-figure income, their cute kid Jakob (Smith), a classy wardrobe and a home with pages directly torn from an Ethan Allen catalog.  Sy is in love with her seemingly immaculate life and unbeknownst to both Nina and Sav-Mart management, he has made and kept additional copies of each roll of film she has turned in for the last eight years.So involved does Sy become with the goings-on in the Yorkins' life that he soon starts following them around, attending one of Jakob's soccer scrimmages and driving halfway across town to a mall where Nina regularly shops.  His obsession with the Yorkins eventually escalates to spying and one day a roll of film turned in by a familiar face reveals a dirty secret behind the Yorkins' pristine faade.Mark Romanek, who has had very little experience with major motion picture directing (most of his work is based in TV and a little dabbling in music video), has done a fantastic job in rendering the stark contrast between Sy's monotonous reality and Nina's boisterous routine.  There is also an emphasis on color, Sav-Mart and Sy's apartment both barren and blanched (even Sy's wardrobe is toneless) and the Yorkins' home drenched in warm, neutral tones with soft light.  The color green appears more than once, symbolic to either affliction (physical/mental) or envy (both make sense considering the film's subtext).Williams is spectacular as Sy, radiating a kaleidoscope of conflicting emotion - sympathy, anger, frustration, despondency and even atonement.  While Sy's actions are considered bizarre and a little disturbing from a bystander's perspective, he still manages to evoke sympathy for his behavior, his desolation justifying his preoccupation with the Yorkins' charmed life.  This is a turn equal to his Oscar-winning performance in 1998's ""Good Will Hunting"" and such an abysmal dive into a character that we forget we are watching an erstwhile comedian - Williams becomes a veritable monster.  What elicits the most chills are his prolonged gazes at the snapshot mosaic that covers nearly the entire wall of his achromatic living room - his expression is vacant, his eyes icy pools of incomprehension.  What is this quiet and outwardly unassuming man capable of?  Stalking?  Blackmail?  Murder?Nielsen and Vartan do fine as Nina and Will Yorkin and Gary Cole manages to play another hard-nosed character as Bill Owens, Sav-Mart's general manager.  Eriq LaSalle makes a brief but smart appearance as Det. James Van Der Zee and the rest of the cast does their best with their small amounts of material.  Of course, we aren't really meant to notice the supporting players - it's very clear from the start that Williams is the film's essence.In its entirety, ""One Hour Photo"" is pretty much a one-man show and Williams exalts the film with little effort. For those who are still skeptical of his dramatic capabilities, ""Awakenings"" and ""Good Will Hunting"" should erase nearly all doubt.  But please, rent this little ditty first - it is indeed his best performance to date, sadly overlooked by this year's Academy Awards.",5,Eerie Portrait,1046563200,"03 2, 2003",2003,4254,"['are', 'many', 'films', 'delve', 'mind', 'psychotics', 'better', 'known', 'psychopaths', 'film', 'history', 'are', 'Norman', 'Bates', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Psycho', '1960', 'Dr.', 'Hannibal', 'Lecter', 'Jonathan', 'Demme', 'Silence', 'Lambs', '1991', 'Patrick', 'Bateman', 'Mary', 'Harron', 'American', 'Psycho', '2000', 'Now', 'sleeper', 'director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'called', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'all-new', 'breed', 'lunatic', 'type', 'even', 'mindful', 'people', 'least', 'suspect.Meet', 'Seymour', 'Parrish', 'Williams', 'better', 'known', 'co-workers', 'Sy', 'who', 'photo', 'lab', 'Wal-Mart-type', 'department', 'store', 'prosaically', 'dubbed', 'Sav-Mart', 'Day', 'day', 'out', 'Sy', 'roll', 'roll', 'film', 'developing', 'sense', 'pride', 'incentive', 'high', 'quality', 'Most', 'what', 'life', 'dark', 'room', 'are', 'images', 'birthday', 'parties', 'weddings', 'anniversaries', 'vacations', 'occasional', 'amateur', 'pornography', 'regular', 'customers', 'one', 'particular', 'who', 'most', 'Nina', 'Yorkin', 'Nielsen', 'who', 'drop-off', 'nearly', 'other', 'week', 'Sav-Mart', 'photo', 'lab', 'picturesque', 'existence', 'Will', 'Vartan', 'handsome', 'husband', 'five-figure', 'income', 'cute', 'kid', 'Jakob', 'Smith', 'classy', 'wardrobe', 'home', 'pages', 'directly', 'torn', 'Ethan', 'Allen', 'catalog', 'Sy', 'love', 'seemingly', 'immaculate', 'life', 'unbeknownst', 'Nina', 'Sav-Mart', 'management', 'made', 'kept', 'additional', 'copies', 'roll', 'film', 'turned', 'last', 'eight', 'years.So', 'involved', 'Sy', 'become', 'goings-on', 'Yorkins', 'life', 'soon', 'following', 'around', 'attending', 'one', 'Jakob', 'soccer', 'scrimmages', 'driving', 'halfway', 'town', 'mall', 'where', 'Nina', 'regularly', 'obsession', 'Yorkins', 'eventually', 'spying', 'one', 'day', 'roll', 'film', 'turned', 'familiar', 'face', 'dirty', 'secret', 'Yorkins', 'pristine', 'faade.Mark', 'Romanek', 'who', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'experience', 'major', 'motion', 'picture', 'directing', 'most', 'work', 'based', 'TV', 'little', 'dabbling', 'music', 'video', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'rendering', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Sy', 'monotonous', 'reality', 'Nina', 'boisterous', 'routine', 'also', 'emphasis', 'color', 'Sav-Mart', 'Sy', 'apartment', 'barren', 'blanched', 'even', 'Sy', 'wardrobe', 'toneless', 'Yorkins', 'home', 'drenched', 'warm', 'neutral', 'tones', 'soft', 'light', 'color', 'green', 'more', 'once', 'symbolic', 'affliction', 'physical/mental', 'envy', 'make', 'sense', 'considering', 'film', 'subtext', '.Williams', 'spectacular', 'Sy', 'radiating', 'kaleidoscope', 'conflicting', 'emotion', 'sympathy', 'anger', 'frustration', 'despondency', 'even', 'atonement', 'Sy', 'actions', 'are', 'considered', 'bizarre', 'little', 'disturbing', 'bystander', 'perspective', 'still', 'evoke', 'sympathy', 'behavior', 'desolation', 'justifying', 'preoccupation', 'Yorkins', 'charmed', 'life', 'turn', 'equal', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', '1998', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'abysmal', 'dive', 'character', 'forget', 'are', 'watching', 'erstwhile', 'comedian', 'Williams', 'veritable', 'monster', 'What', 'most', 'chills', 'are', 'prolonged', 'gazes', 'snapshot', 'mosaic', 'nearly', 'entire', 'wall', 'achromatic', 'living', 'room', 'expression', 'vacant', 'eyes', 'icy', 'pools', 'incomprehension', 'What', 'quiet', 'outwardly', 'unassuming', 'man', 'capable', 'Stalking', 'Blackmail', 'Murder', 'Nielsen', 'Vartan', 'do', 'fine', 'Nina', 'Will', 'Yorkin', 'Gary', 'Cole', 'play', 'hard-nosed', 'character', 'Bill', 'Owens', 'Sav-Mart', 'general', 'manager', 'Eriq', 'LaSalle', 'brief', 'smart', 'appearance', 'Det', 'James', 'Van', 'Der', 'Zee', 'rest', 'cast', 'best', 'small', 'amounts', 'material', 'course', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'meant', 'notice', 'supporting', 'players', 'very', 'clear', 'start', 'Williams', 'film', 'essence.In', 'entirety', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'pretty', 'much', 'one-man', 'show', 'Williams', 'exalts', 'film', 'little', 'effort', 'who', 'are', 'still', 'skeptical', 'dramatic', 'capabilities', 'Awakenings', 'Good', 'Will', 'Hunting', 'should', 'erase', 'nearly', 'doubt', 'please', 'rent', 'little', 'ditty', 'first', 'indeed', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'sadly', 'overlooked', 'year', 'Academy', 'Awards']",N/A
725436,A1O7OMW58QWG5K,B00007976T,Stacey Cochran,"[5, 5]","One Hour Photo was the most disturbing film I've seen this year. Its effectiveness in disturbing an audience comes from creating a character, Sy -- the photoguy -- with whom on some level just about all of us can relate to. Chiefly, that he is lonely, hard-working, clean, mild-mannered, affable, and modest. We've all known someone who portays some of the likeable characteristics that Robin William's vehicle, Sy conveys. But William's character's loneliness develops into an unhealthy and illegal obsession with the charming young Yorkin family. As a photoguy at the SavMart's One Hour Photo lab, he has access to their very normal family photos.That's where the story gets creepy!Sy's attraction to the Yorkin family is not the typical sicko lust attraction. Indeed, writer/director Mark Romanek establishes early on Sy's dislike of pornography, which gives his *emotional* obsession a creedence it wouldn't have had otherwise. Essentially, Sy's attraction/obsession to the family develops to fill the emotional emptiness in his life -- his loneliness -- and the line between an appropriate concern for the family's well-being and an inappropriate concern (indeed, a legal and illegal concern) is the tight-rope Mark Romanek carries the audience along for most of the film. Some of the things Sy does are nice, good, and likeable -- that's what makes this so disturbing.Obviously, plastering his apartment wall with a Warhol-esque assemblage of the Yorkin family photos is bizarre -- even illegal -- but much of his other interaction early on in the film seems to have good intentions.Indeed, the scale is clearly tipped only when Sy loses his job because of his unhealthy and illegal obsession with the Yorkin family photos *and* finds out that Will Yorkin is cheating on Nina his wife.My girlfriend and I kept saying ""What's he gonna do?"" and ""How's the film gonna end?"" in that we didn't want Robin Williams to be bad. The audience wants him to do good and it's established that he is capable of doing good.Indeed, Sy ends up conveying a rather convoluted cautionary tale to the police detective (the guy from ER!) at the end, warning him against neglecting *his* family, against infidelity. And Romanek makes a point to show that the detective is listening to him, albeit skeptically at first.Ultimately, it's safe just to call this a psychological thriller and to say bad, bad, bad -- that there's no question that Sy the photoguy is bad. But it may be that he *has* good intentions that makes his bad intentions all the more compelling.A complex film. A remarkably self-controlled performance by Robin Williams.

I won't bore you with restating what many have already covered well.My take on this film is a little different. A persual of the reviews below I don't see this angle discussed. Its regarding Sy's damage.The film's ending makes the most powerful statement. That statement is damage of children by their parents. Sy's whole rationale for his frightening acts in the hotel were simple: Mr. Yorkin wasn't a good husband and father. The emotional outburst about photos of children and things they shouldn't have to do said it all. Sy wasn't monster, but a person who is really scarred. The expierences of his childhood made him a mess and unable to interact normally with people.At the end of the film I really felt for him. He became a wounded and damaged individual who had a normal life stripped away young. His obsession with the Yorkin's was based on the desire for a life he could never have.The film and narrative are well done and paced. It feels sort of like a documentary. The creepy Mr. Rogers tone plays well.There are the people who will see Sy's actions and place emphasis on them. Lost in those views is what the writers were really saying about one man. Specifically this one man. A man who is a abuse survivor and carries that deep damage.I didn't much care for the final scenes. Instead of the Yorkin's home safely as the closer. Adding Sy being helped as the final scene would've been much more effective. Speaking for myself, I wanted to see Sy get some help.

And Robin Williams looks diffrent in this movie, than he does in other movies, but sonds the same. The movie also has Gary Cole from I'll Be Home For Christmas plays his boss Bill Owens. As the movie opens, Seymour Parrish works at the photo counter at SavMart. Seymour takes your film, gets it devloped, and has it ready until time for the custmors to pick up. But the only things, his custmors don't know about, is that he makes copies of photos that they haven't taken for himself. Seymour's favorite custmors are Mrs. Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) an her son Jakob &quot;Jake&quot; Yorkin (Dylan Smith). He gave Mrs. Yorkin 5x7 photos when she wanted 4x6 photos. And when he learns that Jake has had his 9th birthday, he gives Jake a free camera for his birthday.

Robin Williams gives the performance of his career as Sy, The Photo Guy. A very clever trailer and promotional campaign ensure your expectations are headed in one direction while Mark Romanek's subtle screenplay quietly reveals its true and more complex intent. Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek's unsettling score and Tom Foden's thoughtful production design conspire brilliantly to take this simple story to new levels of tension. This is not only a brilliant second feature from Romanek but a brilliant film in its own right, made all the more satisfying because it doesn't resort to explaining everything - Romanek leaves the audience with plenty of work to do, and plenty to think about: most importanty, how often do we accept the 'picture perfect' people and demonize those who are different without having any understanding of either of their lives? From the tone of the reviews, plenty of viewers were diappointed that this didn't deliver the kind of horrific, blood-soaked climax they were expecting. But that's part of the point: if you think about the kind of backstory which drove Sy to do what he did, then you realise it's far more chilling than any orgy of violence could have been.

I'm not going to rehash what the film ""is about."" You've already read that.But all of the film's deliberate coldness and psychotic tensions reveal themselves through Williams' character, Sy Parons. They ultimately lead to one profoundly sad revelation: Sy is a victim of early child abuse. As the film further reveals, it was by his own father who was undoubtedly also an adulterer (note the scenes of the photos in Sy's apartment where the adulterer father's face is scratched off of every photo).Sy is in no way a ""bad"" or ""loathesome"" person. Nor are his intentions evil. He is essentially still a child who could never really grow up, struggling to make something meaningful of his life in spite of wounds that have left him emotionally crippled and unable to deal effectively with relationships. How sad we are for him!Some clues are apparent noteably in the scenes where Sy forces the adulterer to commit further acts with his terrified partner, so that he may photograph them for posterity, or so it would seem. His threat, ""If you don't do what I say, I will stab you in the heart"", is not what would come from the mouth of an ax murderer. And when he asks the couple to perform oral sex and the adulter proceeds, Sy admonishes him, asserting, ""Don't do that. This is not REAL, it's just pretend!""The final scene in the police interrogation room with Sy and his photos is straight from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and a further revelation of Sy's hurt.Bottom line, don't miss One Hour Photo.

His empty humdrum life begins to find a meaning as in his fantasies he sees himself belonging...But where he attaches &quot;belonging&quot; is indeed where he doesnt belong into as he pictures himself as a secret uncle of that family.When he finds out that the husband of that family has turned unfaithful to his wife he decides it's time to take measures.Predictably, those measures carry the psychotic touches that have been taking over him and the results are...somewhat ugly.With such a setting (the idea is on its own scary and actually does drive the film automatically in certain points) and with Williams in very convincing form and in a role that seems to be a perfect cast &quot;One hour Photo&quot; should've been gone down as a classic in the genre.But it doesn't.

For this reason I purchased the DVD as soon as it was released. Though it was not as critically acclaimed a movie as one would expect from a film that stars Robin Williams, it is worth seeing and adding to a DVD or video collection. The premise of the movie, a mild mannered clerk at a photo lab being somewhat psychic seemed like an interesting plot for a movie. The viewer gets the sense that Sy, Robin William's character is someone who has his problems, but at first he seems harmless. There are danger signs about Sy that the viewer quickly sees, but Nina Yorkin, the woman who brings her family photos for Sy to develop, fails to see. This adds a sense of realism since victims are so often the last people to know they are being victimized, even though it is clear to others. Since it is a suspense movie, I am not going to say more about the plot but it is original, and actually quite plausible.The film's chief strength is the strong cast. Unfortunately there are times the film does not move all that quickly, which can be deadly for a suspense movie, but if viewers watch it to the end, it is worthwhile.People have joked that after the movie Psycho, people feared taking a shower, and after the film the Birds, people have been afraid of our feathered friends ganging up on us. Could One Hour Photo do the same for photo developing? Should we be fearful of those who make our Kodak moments come to life? I will have to admit, since watching the film I do wonder who actually develops my photos, and I know others who have jokingly asked the same question after viewing this movie. Fortunately I know the people who process most of my pictures somewhat well, so I don't have to worry about truth being stranger than fiction.

After making impressive films like ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Hedwig and Angry Inch"" (or not so impressive ""Office Killer""), they produced another film with a serious theme.  But don't worry; despite its subject matter, ""One Hour Photo"" is not as schocking as ""Taxi Driver.""  No strange haircut, no handguns in the sleeve, but just Sy, loneliest guy in the world.Robim Willimas, after 3 years' absence, throws away any good-guy image he gathered in the 90s, and becomes Sy Parrish, one hour photo techinician working at a counter in a huge shopping center.  He works earnestly, takes his job seriously, and, most of all, is utterly lonely.  His only (day)dream is to be 'Uncle Sy' of his customer and picture perfect family Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin (read 'Your Kin'), whose life Sy hopelessly longs for.  But soon we learn that Sy can no longer handle his fantasy, and we are going to see his illusion run amok, making him stalk around the family.  And everything rushes to the disaster when Uncle Sy knows something he should not know about the family.The film owns its enormous power to Robin Williams's creepy performance as Sy, who gradually loses the control of himself.  Though you may feel he looks (or sounds) like Patch Adams at first, you soon forget that sense, thanks to his strong acting.  By accepting the role of this lonely man, he once again after the good turn in ""Insomnia"" shows his will to extend his faculty as an actor, and he shows it well.  In fact, he has already shown another aspect of acting in his cameo role of terrorist in ""The Secret Agent"" (Joseph Conrad's film version), but never fully achieved the result.  But now he did it.But ""One Hour Photo"" is helped by other factors; supporting actors Michael Vartan (Drew's teacher in ""Never Been Kissed"") and Connie Nielsen (""Gladiator"") are both good, but the film's strength, in my opinion, comes from its production designs, music, and photography.  They all contribute to creating the cold, detached atomosphere of the film, and their effort is effectively shown in the manufactured feeling of the shopping place, with symmetrical shots of the unnnaturally clean and  white interiors.  That comes as no surprise when you know that production designer Tom Foden's previous work was Jennifer Lopez's thriller ""The Cell"" and photographer Jeff Cronenweth worked for ""Fight Club"" (by the way, his father Jordan Cronenweth may be much more famous for his ""Blade Runner"").""One Hour Photo"" has some minor flaws -- dream sequence that looks out of tune, and flashback structure of narrative, for instance -- but the film is fascinating as a character study of Sy, this very lonely guy.",5,The Portrait of a Loneliest Man in the World,1044576000,"02 7, 2003",2003,2706,"['People', 'indie', 'film', 'company', 'Killer', 'Films', 'did', 'again', 'making', 'impressive', 'films', 'Boys', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry', 'Hedwig', 'Angry', 'Inch', 'not', 'so', 'impressive', 'Office', 'Killer', 'produced', 'film', 'serious', 'theme', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', 'subject', 'matter', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'not', 'as', 'schocking', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'strange', 'haircut', 'handguns', 'sleeve', 'just', 'Sy', 'loneliest', 'guy', 'world.Robim', 'Willimas', '3', 'years', 'absence', 'away', 'good-guy', 'image', 'gathered', '90s', 'Sy', 'Parrish', 'one', 'hour', 'photo', 'techinician', 'working', 'counter', 'huge', 'shopping', 'center', 'earnestly', 'job', 'seriously', 'most', 'utterly', 'lonely', 'only', 'day', 'dream', 'be', ""'Uncle"", 'Sy', ""'"", 'customer', 'picture', 'perfect', 'family', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Yorkin', 'read', ""'Your"", 'Kin', 'life', 'Sy', 'hopelessly', 'soon', 'learn', 'Sy', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'handle', 'fantasy', 'are', 'going', 'see', 'illusion', 'run', 'amok', 'making', 'stalk', 'family', 'everything', 'rushes', 'disaster', 'when', 'Uncle', 'Sy', 'something', 'should', 'not', 'know', 'family.The', 'film', 'enormous', 'power', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'creepy', 'performance', 'Sy', 'who', 'gradually', 'control', 'may', 'feel', 'Patch', 'Adams', 'first', 'soon', 'forget', 'sense', 'thanks', 'strong', 'acting', 'accepting', 'role', 'lonely', 'man', 'once', 'again', 'good', 'turn', 'Insomnia', 'will', 'extend', 'faculty', 'actor', 'well', 'fact', 'already', 'shown', 'aspect', 'acting', 'cameo', 'role', 'terrorist', 'Secret', 'Agent', 'Joseph', 'Conrad', 'film', 'version', 'never', 'fully', 'achieved', 'result', 'now', 'did', 'it.But', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'helped', 'other', 'factors', 'supporting', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Vartan', 'Drew', 'teacher', 'Never', 'Been', 'Kissed', 'Connie', 'Nielsen', 'Gladiator', 'are', 'good', 'film', 'strength', 'opinion', 'production', 'designs', 'music', 'photography', 'contribute', 'creating', 'cold', 'detached', 'atomosphere', 'film', 'effort', 'effectively', 'shown', 'manufactured', 'feeling', 'shopping', 'place', 'symmetrical', 'shots', 'unnnaturally', 'clean', 'white', 'interiors', 'surprise', 'when', 'know', 'production', 'designer', 'Tom', 'Foden', 'previous', 'work', 'was', 'Jennifer', 'Lopez', 'thriller', 'Cell', 'Jeff', 'Cronenweth', 'worked', 'Fight', 'Club', 'way', 'father', 'Jordan', 'Cronenweth', 'may', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'famous', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'minor', 'flaws', 'dream', 'sequence', 'tune', 'flashback', 'structure', 'narrative', 'instance', 'film', 'fascinating', 'character', 'study', 'Sy', 'very', 'lonely', 'guy']",N/A

He has been working there for 20+ years and over the pst 9 has helped this wonderful family that he truely loves.  He is very friendly, but very introverted.  Hoever this family fills hinm with joy, they are like the perfect family to him.  However his boss does not like him, and tries to do whatever he can to get him fired.  Finally when he discovers that up to 100 photos have gone missing over the years, as well as a disposible camera that Williams character gave the son over, WIlliams loses his job.  In the course of this he hits a state of depression and he discovers shortly there after that the perfect family he admires, is not so perfect, as the husband has been cheating on the wife, and the Mistress has been photographing the whole ordeal.  These turn of events leads to a very chilling very sad ending that wraps up  this really unique movie.I also got the feeling that either the Writer or the Director was a Neon Genesis Envangellion Fan because of frequent looks on that and also how WIlliams Character went through a shocking and drastic change much like Shinji did in NEon Genesis Envangellion (If you have no idea what I am talking about, Neon Genesis is an Anime sereis that is around 25 episodes and is very strange but very powerful).I am giving this movie 5 stars because it is that damn good.

725457,A254Z4O7ORVL6U,B00007976T,wellwellwell,"[1, 1]","Do not expect Robin Williams to make you laugh with this movie.  This is not a comedy like a `Patch Adams' or a `Mrs. Doubtfire'.  In fact, this is not a comedy at all.  But Williams' character of Sy ""the photo guy"" is certainly one for the books; or at least one you can look at and shudder.  He does a very good job as a quiet, would-be psycho who resides in the feeling of being part of an everyday family he is obsessed with.  Anyone who enjoys Robin Williams' work, not just his comedy, will most likely enjoy the movie when it's all said and done.  I think that's a fair assumption.  I would not categorize this movie as a ""horror"" movie; it's more creepy and sinister than it is horrifying.  But lord behold, there are numerous parts where you will shiver with fear (the bleeding eyes segment is particularly disturbing).  Sadly, I think it's the laid back attempt to produce a disturbing atmospheric movie that doesn't allow for `One Hour Photo' to become much more than average.Sy gets his nickname, ""the photo guy"", because he works at the film counter of a SavMart (a sad attempt to parody Wal-Mart) where he processes people's film.  He seems to take great pride in his work; and that really shows when he goes over each type of customer he gets.  He makes note of the birthday party families, insurance agencies printing accident photos, and jokingly, the amateur adult entertainer.  That might've been the only funny part of the movie.  Sy takes a particular liking with the Yorkin family, a family that has been coming to him since their son Jake was born.  A family that in Sy's mind is the idyllic family that holds the idealistic life style he only wishes he had.  From the beginning, we see parts of Nina's, Will's, and Jake's lives through not only pictures, but thoughts and dreams in Sy's mind.  And all those thoughts built up in Sy's imagination force him to drift away from his own life and, sometimes, his work.  Watching Sy channel surf was reminiscent of an insomniac (the `Simpsons` excerpt was short but funny).  There is great turmoil between Sy and his boss (played by `Office Space' actor Gary Cole).  One thing that is continually disturbing about this movie is how incredibly uncomfortable it makes you.  Not because it's scary, but because it's so darn creepy.  And the music behind the movie really adds character (and eeriness) to what was already there.  Sy, in all ways, manages to seem off-putting to his customers; which is something you see even the Yorkin family contemplating.  I'm sure it was intended to be that way, yet still, it is a bit too strange of a feeling for some people to handle.  But it's entertaining, to say the least.  For the first hour or so, the movie seems to be coasting along; letting us think about what's going to happen.  And as confusion within the Yorkin family and problems with Sy's work collide, the climactic point is reached.  The director does a good job leading us up to that climactic point; as it's not too sudden and not too predictable.  I won't spoil it for you.  From the start to the point of the confrontation (the climax), the only thing that isn't covered is Seymour ""Sy"" Parrish's background.  Again it was probably intended to be vague, but again it was somewhat confusing.  And therefore so was the ending.I never like to spoil movies for people, and I certainly won't do that here.  I highly recommend this movie if you appreciate Robin Williams as an accomplished actor; not just a comedian.  Even with good supporting roles by Connie Nielson, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith as the Yorkin's and the appearance by Gary Cole, Williams is really the only actor who shines bright.  The back cover for `One Hour Photo' states that this movie will do for photo processing what `Psycho' did for showers.  I don't know if I'd go quite that far, but still be sure to keep your kids away from this one.

While &quot;....Photo&quot; tries really hard to summon up tension and actual fear, one walks away from the film feeling a little letdown. Robin Williams is terrific as Sy, a sad, lonely and obviously disturbed man who obsesses over his work a bit too much (and the wall collage of photos in his apartment is sorta creepy), but I never sensed any real danger from him, even when he was holding Will Yorkin and his mistress Maya at knife point, on the contrary, it was actually rather funny! The ending is a completely worthless, but I rate the film so highly because it LOOKS so good and Williams is first-rate in all his scenes. Director Mark Romanek copies Kubrick a little too closely at times but never quite achieves Kubrick's fluid camera movement or his brilliance at making every scene look like a finely detailed painting awash in blinding white light and full of uncomfortable silences. A nice film to look at, but &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; seems comedic instead of disturbing or scary.",4,"Great Direction and Solid Work From Robin Williams, But.....",1054944000,"06 7, 2003",2003,1036,"[""n't"", 'much', 'story', 'here', 'quot', '.Photo', 'quot', 'tries', 'really', 'hard', 'summon', 'up', 'tension', 'actual', 'fear', 'one', 'away', 'film', 'feeling', 'little', 'letdown', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'terrific', 'Sy', 'sad', 'lonely', 'obviously', 'disturbed', 'man', 'who', 'work', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'wall', 'collage', 'photos', 'apartment', 'sorta', 'creepy', 'never', 'sensed', 'real', 'danger', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'holding', 'Will', 'Yorkin', 'mistress', 'Maya', 'knife', 'point', 'contrary', 'was', 'actually', 'rather', 'funny', 'ending', 'completely', 'worthless', 'rate', 'film', 'so', 'highly', 'LOOKS', 'so', 'good', 'Williams', 'first-rate', 'scenes', 'Director', 'Mark', 'Romanek', 'copies', 'Kubrick', 'little', 'too', 'closely', 'times', 'never', 'quite', 'Kubrick', 'fluid', 'camera', 'movement', 'brilliance', 'making', 'scene', 'look', 'finely', 'detailed', 'painting', 'awash', 'blinding', 'white', 'light', 'full', 'uncomfortable', 'silences', 'nice', 'film', 'look', 'quot', 'One', 'Hour', 'Photo', 'quot', 'comedic', 'instead', 'disturbing', 'scary']",N/A

As ""Sy the Photo-Guy"", Williams is as chilling as he is sympathetic.For the most part, director Romanek eschews predictability and takes us on an ambiguous journey that challenges us and involves us on every level rather than presenting an easy, black-and-white universe that cues us to gasp or scream in the appropriate places. This is a tale told with a great stylistic flair that fleshes out rather than detracts from the thematic material.

725461,AP3B615GM191G,B00007976T,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","Some horror movies (like the Halloween or Saw franchises, for instance) are easy to categorize, and you'll know exactly what you'll get when you push the ""PLAY"" button.  Other films (like What Lies Beneath or The Others) start out as thrillers, but end up providing genuine scares in the process.  ""One Hour Photo"" falls squarely into the latter category.The plot of this movie focuses on Cy Parrish (Robin Williams), a Photo Center associate at the Sav-Mart (a copyright-friendly Wal-Mart) retail store.  Though at first it seems as if Cy is a friendly (albeit slightly strange) guy who puts his all into his rather mundane job, we quickly discover how close to the edge of sanity he really is.The hallmark of this movie is the slow progression of Cy Parrish into complete and utter insanity.  At first, Cy just seems like a lonely old man who makes up for it by interacting positively with his customers.  However, when a series of events challenges his views on life and frustrates him a bit, he quickly loses his grip on reality and goes to a place much darker than we would ever expect.The first time I saw this film, it truly creeped me out, something that doesn't happen all that often.  The acting performance from Robin Williams (perhaps the finest of his entire career) creates a truly terrifying character that a part of us can all relate to.Thus, One Hour Photo is a surprisingly creepy suspense flick that thrives on excellent acting and an intense character study of a loner.

Sy is very passionate at his job. He puts his full effort into every photo he develops. He has developed photos for the Yorkin family ever since there son was born.
