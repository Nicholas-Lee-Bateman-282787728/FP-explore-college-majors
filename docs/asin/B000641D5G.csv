A consultant to the movie was Merton E. Harrison, who was the 1912 ""ghost writer"" of the Autobiography of Dan Patch, which was the first-person (Standardbred) recollections of the then-retired racer.But the movie is ultimately an enjoyable breeze around the oval, which will aim the curious into a trek to find the rest of the story through recent books and media accounts from newspapers when the legend was shattering records on the track and earning more than $1 million a year through a number of major endorsements.",3,A Path Filled With Uneven Patches,1214870400,"07 1, 2008",2008,850,"['keeping', 'mind', 'type', 'biographies', 'sporting', 'themes', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'generate', 'era', 'syrup', 'real', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'dessert.Based', 'iconic', 'natural', 'pacer', 'early', 'years', 'century', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'script', 'sure', 'good', 'story', 'not', 'get', 'way', 'facts', 'consultant', 'movie', 'was', 'Merton', 'E.', 'Harrison', 'who', 'was', '1912', 'ghost', 'writer', 'Autobiography', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'was', 'first-person', 'Standardbred', 'recollections', 'then-retired', 'racer.But', 'movie', 'ultimately', 'enjoyable', 'breeze', 'oval', 'will', 'aim', 'curious', 'trek', 'find', 'rest', 'story', 'recent', 'books', 'media', 'accounts', 'newspapers', 'when', 'legend', 'was', 'shattering', 'records', 'track', 'earning', 'more', '1', 'million', 'year', 'number', 'major', 'endorsements']",N/A
858410,A1GQQFTPA23Z1O,B000641D5G,Dave,"[11, 12]","This 1949 movie is based on the true story of the legendary race horse Dan Patch, who in eleven years of racing remained undefeated. ""Great Dan Patch"" is certainly no masterpiece, but it's nevertheless an enjoyable movie with a great cast. Arthur Hunnicutt, whom you'll recognize from ""The Red Badge of Courage"", adds a lot here in a suporting role. Chemist David Palmer (Dennis O'Keefe) has just married a snobby socialite, Ruth Treadwell (Ruth Warrick), and is also the owner of race horses. When he purchases Dan Patch he knows he's gotten a very special horse, and the trainer Ben Lathrop (John Hoyt), along with his daughter Cissy (Gail Russell), takes good care of Dan Patch. Cissy has had a crush on David for a long time, but his marriage to Ruth has crushed her hopes.Finally, David realizes that he can no longer tolerate his obnoxious wife, and he leaves her and heads for the lovely Cissy. Meanwhile, David sales Dan Patch for $60,000 and the horse becomes a major success touring the country. Of course the story of Dan Patch is in the background throughout the film as the main focus is on Cissy's love for David, but that was okay with me. I never was a fan of horse racing anyway! The reason I purchased this dvd was because I'm a big fan of beautiful Gail Russell, who unfortunately died on August 26, 1961, from an alcohol induced heart attack. She was only 36 years old and had appeared in only 23 films, yet she left behind a legacy of exceptional performances.This dvd from Alpha has an acceptable picture and sound quality, considering that the print used is the public domain unrestored version. All things considered, this movie is well-worth watching and is recommended for any fan of Gail Russell or Dennis O'Keefe.",4,"""Slopping hogs & pitching manure is more your style...""",1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,1741,"['1949', 'movie', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'legendary', 'race', 'horse', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'who', 'eleven', 'years', 'racing', 'remained', 'undefeated', 'Great', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'certainly', 'masterpiece', 'nevertheless', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'great', 'cast', 'Arthur', 'Hunnicutt', 'whom', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'Red', 'Badge', 'Courage', 'lot', 'here', 'suporting', 'role', 'Chemist', 'David', 'Palmer', 'Dennis', ""O'Keefe"", 'just', 'married', 'snobby', 'socialite', 'Ruth', 'Treadwell', 'Ruth', 'Warrick', 'also', 'owner', 'race', 'horses', 'When', 'purchases', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'very', 'special', 'horse', 'trainer', 'Ben', 'Lathrop', 'John', 'Hoyt', 'daughter', 'Cissy', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'good', 'care', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'Cissy', 'had', 'crush', 'David', 'long', 'time', 'marriage', 'Ruth', 'crushed', 'hopes.Finally', 'David', 'can', 'no', 'longer', 'tolerate', 'obnoxious', 'wife', 'heads', 'lovely', 'Cissy', 'Meanwhile', 'David', 'sales', 'Dan', 'Patch', '60,000', 'horse', 'major', 'success', 'touring', 'country', 'course', 'story', 'Dan', 'Patch', 'background', 'film', 'main', 'focus', 'Cissy', 'love', 'David', 'was', 'okay', 'never', 'was', 'fan', 'horse', 'racing', 'anyway', 'reason', 'purchased', 'dvd', 'was', ""'m"", 'big', 'fan', 'beautiful', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'who', 'unfortunately', 'died', 'August', '26', '1961', 'alcohol', 'induced', 'heart', 'attack', 'was', 'only', '36', 'years', 'old', 'had', 'appeared', 'only', '23', 'films', 'yet', 'left', 'behind', 'legacy', 'exceptional', 'performances.This', 'dvd', 'Alpha', 'acceptable', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'considering', 'print', 'used', 'public', 'domain', 'unrestored', 'version', 'things', 'considered', 'movie', 'well-worth', 'watching', 'recommended', 'fan', 'Gail', 'Russell', 'Dennis', ""O'Keefe""]",N/A
