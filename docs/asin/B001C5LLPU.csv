It starts out with two people whose lives hit the skids around the same time. Deciding to make themselves feel better they head to no other place but Vegas. They meet by accident, then, after a night of drinking, partying, and other things wake up to find they accidently got married! Not totally unusual.They decide they want to get divorced, but then have their first marital spat and inside of it they find they win $3 million dollars. That's when the trouble starts.They're sentenced to actually spend 6 months as a couple(the twist part). The first few months are the most fun part of the movie. From missing doors, dishes, parties and a bread fight, they do some pretty awful things to each other that I'm sure has crossed the minds of those in a relationship before, nevermind just being married. I found those to be absolutely hilarious.The second half of the movie is where the romance creeps in. But the romance wasn't the crappy, sappy, men will want to let it be known their girlfriends made them watch it and not because they wanted to, type romance. It's actually rather sweet and the type you'd wish there were more of in a romantic comedy. Light.

As many reviewers have pointed out, the plot is somewhat typical, contrived and raunchy at points, especially near the beginning. I think what saves the movie is two things. First of all, there is some good acting by a number of actors that do well with their parts. None of the performances are over the top but many are quirky and memorable. Second, although a movie like this has many opportunities to become ridiculous or have scenes that are beyond believable, this one seems to stop short of that. Just when you cringe and think you can see a typical silly scene coming, the movie stops short. The result is a fairly funny movie that also has some heart to it. I'm not sure the love-hate-love sequence is completely believable but it does provide for some alternately funny then touching scenes. Somehow in the end I came away liking the movie and feeling like I could easily watch it again in the future.

1175134,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B001C5LLPU,Andrew Ellington,"[14, 15]","Okay, so sue me; I laughed a lot while watching this movie.  My wife said that the film was horribly stupid but I didn't care.  Sure, it was predictable beyond belief but why would you expect anything but a predictable romantic comedy?  I mean, yes, at times the humor was a little off color or just plain ridiculous, but in a world embracing the comedic genius that is Judd Apatow (don't get me wrong, this is no where near as good as an Apatow production) why would you get mad over that?`What Happens in Vegas' is exactly what you'd expect from a comedy starring Aston Kutcher.The film tells the story of control freak Joy and slacker Jack.  Joy was just dumped by her fianc&eacute; and Jack was just fired by his own father.  When all goes wrong the only viable option is to go crazy in Vegas, so that is what they decide to do.  It is in Vegas where they meet and get drunk and get hitched only to wake up desperate to end their relationship; that is until Jack wins $3,000,000 with Joy's quarter and each wants the cash.  What happens next is highly unlikely (very highly) but for the sake of the film we'll follow along.  A judge sentences them to a half year of marriage before either of them can be awarded the money.  Jack and Joy are thus forced to live together and `work on their marriage' in order to attain the cast they so desperately desire.The pot shots taken are over-the-top at times, but funny none-the-less.  The situation is more preposterous than any of the jokes, and the actions taken by the two main characters, as immature as they are, are believable when you take into context the nature of the characters they are playing.I mean seriously, a lot of people are that stupid.Cameron Diaz is above this, I will say that.  She is a wonderfully talented comedic actress who deserves better than the material she is provided here.  Her performances in films like `Vanilla Sky' and `Being John Malkovich' and even `My Best Friends Wedding' all prove her talent and should have garnered an Oscar nomination by now.  Instead she is reduced to starring alongside Aston Kutcher in a film tailor made for his persona as apposed to her talent.  This is not above Kutcher, in fact it is a step up for him (look at what he's done up until now).  Honestly, if you are looking at this film because you are a fan of Kutcher then you have nothing to complain about since this is undeniably one of his better films.  If you are watching this because you are a fan of Diaz then you may have reason to be bitter since this may be the worst film she's ever done.Forget them for a minute though, because the real stars of this film are Rob Corddry and Lake Bell who play Hater and Tipper, the happy couples best friends.  These two have such a brilliant love/hate chemistry that is seriously the funniest part of the film.In the end I can't say that this is a great movie or one that I would highly recommend, but if you are a fan of the genre or the films male lead then you already know what to expect and you most likely will enjoy this film to an extent.  If you are not a fan of either then you should really be looking elsewhere.  Regardless, look at it for what it is and you will find something enjoyable about the whole experience.",3,"It may be stupid, but it's still kinda funny...",1221609600,"09 17, 2008",2008,3245,"['Okay', 'so', 'sue', 'laughed', 'lot', 'watching', 'movie', 'wife', 'said', 'film', 'was', 'horribly', 'stupid', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Sure', 'was', 'predictable', 'belief', 'why', 'would', 'expect', 'anything', 'predictable', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'mean', 'yes', 'times', 'humor', 'was', 'little', 'off', 'color', 'just', 'plain', 'ridiculous', 'world', 'embracing', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'Apatow', 'production', 'why', 'would', 'get', 'mad', 'What', 'Vegas', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'expect', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Aston', 'Kutcher.The', 'film', 'story', 'control', 'freak', 'Joy', 'slacker', 'Jack', 'Joy', 'was', 'just', 'dumped', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'Jack', 'was', 'just', 'fired', 'own', 'father', 'When', 'wrong', 'only', 'viable', 'option', 'go', 'crazy', 'Vegas', 'what', 'decide', 'do', 'Vegas', 'where', 'meet', 'get', 'drunk', 'get', 'hitched', 'only', 'wake', 'up', 'desperate', 'end', 'relationship', 'Jack', '3,000,000', 'Joy', 'quarter', 'cash', 'What', 'next', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'very', 'highly', 'sake', 'film', ""'ll"", 'follow', 'along', 'judge', 'half', 'year', 'marriage', 'can', 'be', 'awarded', 'money', 'Jack', 'Joy', 'are', 'thus', 'forced', 'live', 'together', 'work', 'marriage', 'order', 'attain', 'cast', 'so', 'desperately', 'desire.The', 'pot', 'shots', 'taken', 'are', 'over-the-top', 'times', 'funny', 'none-the-less', 'situation', 'more', 'preposterous', 'jokes', 'actions', 'taken', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'as', 'immature', 'are', 'are', 'believable', 'when', 'take', 'context', 'nature', 'characters', 'are', 'playing.I', 'mean', 'seriously', 'lot', 'people', 'are', 'stupid.Cameron', 'Diaz', 'will', 'say', 'wonderfully', 'talented', 'comedic', 'actress', 'who', 'better', 'material', 'provided', 'here', 'performances', 'films', 'Vanilla', 'Sky', 'Being', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'even', 'Best', 'Friends', 'Wedding', 'prove', 'talent', 'should', 'have', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'now', 'Instead', 'reduced', 'starring', 'alongside', 'Aston', 'Kutcher', 'film', 'tailor', 'made', 'persona', 'apposed', 'talent', 'not', 'Kutcher', 'fact', 'step', 'up', 'look', 'what', 'done', 'up', 'now', 'Honestly', 'are', 'looking', 'film', 'are', 'fan', 'Kutcher', 'then', 'have', 'nothing', 'complain', 'undeniably', 'one', 'better', 'films', 'are', 'watching', 'are', 'fan', 'Diaz', 'then', 'may', 'have', 'reason', 'be', 'bitter', 'may', 'be', 'worst', 'film', 'ever', 'done.Forget', 'minute', 'real', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'who', 'play', 'Hater', 'Tipper', 'happy', 'couples', 'best', 'friends', 'two', 'have', 'brilliant', 'love/hate', 'chemistry', 'seriously', 'funniest', 'part', 'film.In', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'one', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'are', 'fan', 'genre', 'films', 'male', 'lead', 'then', 'already', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'most', 'likely', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'extent', 'are', 'not', 'fan', 'then', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'looking', 'elsewhere', 'Regardless', 'look', 'what', 'will', 'find', 'something', 'enjoyable', 'whole', 'experience']",N/A

Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher are two strangers who meet in Vegas, get married without realizing it, and then are forced to stay together for six months by a divorce judge.

Cameron Diaz does a great job of her role as the likeable girl.  Her only flaw is that she looks like someone who has tanned too much in their youth and so her skin looks a little rough.

1175146,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B001C5LLPU,Chris Pandolfi,"[3, 7]","""What Happens in Vegas"" is not an insightful or intelligent movie, but it actually works. It's a juvenile romantic comedy, perfect for those who like their love stories a little on the immature side. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz play their roles like teenagers trapped in adult bodies, spending most of the film as spouses scheming to make each other's life a living hell. An uncredited Queen Latifah plays a marriage therapist who says the two were made for each other, despite having individual issues that need to be worked out. I immediately replayed the events of the film in my head and realized she was right; one is the other's emotional equal, and both will willingly do what it takes to make sure they come out on top. While none of this makes for a funny movie, and while the story is completely predictable, it was still interesting to watch these characters interact with one another.The setup is as follows. Joy McNally (Diaz) is a career-minded, people-pleasing stock trader from Manhattan, and Jack Fuller (Kutcher) is a fun-loving furniture maker from Brooklyn; when the former is dumped by her fianc&eacute;e and the latter is fired by his father, they both escape to Las Vegas. They conveniently meet each other, spend a night on the town, have far too much to drink, and wake up the next morning as husband and wife. They both intend to annul the marriage as soon as possible ... until Jack uses one of Joy's quarters on a slot machine and wins a $3,000,000 jackpot. Both feel entitled to the money, so naturally, they end up in court back home in New York. The judge (Dennis Miller), disgusted at their behavior, freezes the money and sentences them to ""six months hard marriage"" with weekly marriage counseling; if they can get through it civilly, the money will be equally divided among them. Since Joy has no place of her own, she has no choice but to move into Jack's disgusting bachelor pad.Of course, both are determined to take their half of the money, just as both are determined to make each other miserable every step of the way. Joy purposely spends too much time in the bathroom, so Jack has the door removed. He removes the toilet lid so that she can fall in the next time she has to go. He pees into the kitchen sink when it's her turn to do the dishes. Things take an interesting turn when Jack's lawyer friend, nicknamed Hater (Rob Corddry), discovers a legal loophole: if Joy were unfaithful, Jack would be entitled to all $3,000,000. As fate would have it, Joy's best friend, Tipper (Lake Bell), also discovers the loophole. Joy immediately hires a group of sexy young women to throw a spur-of-the-moment party in Jack's apartment. Jack retaliates by seeking out her former fianc&eacute;e, Mason (Jason Sudeikis), and making him jealous with news of her good new life.At a certain point, Joy introduces herself to Jack's parents, and that where things finally start to get serious. His mother (Deirdre O'Connell) is pleasant enough, but his father (Treat Williams) is highly critical of everything Jack does, even when it comes to how he builds furniture. Despite having just met her, both think that Joy is a wonderful person, a perfect catch for their son. They like her so much that they invite her to a big family gathering, and it there that Jack and Joy actually begin to tolerate each other. By the time Jack becomes friends with Joy's obnoxious boss (Dennis Farina), they realize that they may even like each other. If you weren't expecting this to happen, then you haven't seen very many romantic comedies; no matter how unique the characters, the settings, or the tones, these kinds of films always follow a specific formula of Boy Gets Girl, Boy Loses Girl, Boy Gets Girl Back. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is no exception.There is, however, a unique twist on the first part of that formula: boy gets girl completely by mistake, so he spends most of the film trying to lose her. But what really sets this movie apart from other romantic comedies is the overactive sense of humor, which had absolutely no effect on me. Maybe I'm too dense to see the humor in Tipper constantly wanting to punch men in the genitals or Hater using a drawing to give her the bird. Much like Jack and Joy, Hater and Tipper are made for each other, trading insults as if being paid by the letter. ""If I could make someone dead with my mind,"" she says, ""it would be you."" ""This is my lesbian sister,"" he says in front of a group of women. ""Why don't you tell them about your softball team?""And then there's Dennis Farina's character, whose name is Richard Banger. You know what the nickname for ""Richard"" is, don't you? Never mind--the point is that none of this adds very much to the film. I was more interested in how the relationship between Diaz and Kutcher developed, how they go from malicious to compassionate in a relatively short period of time. It's actually a fascinating thing to see, because once they get past their petty differences, the chemistry between them somewhat believable. Most of it is reserved for the last act, when Jack gets on Banger's good side so that Joy can finally be promoted. At that point, one of Jack's earlier lines hits home: ""I'd rather be happy doing nothing than doing something I hate."" I'm recommending ""What Happens in Vegas"" for the more interesting moments reflected in lines like that, moments that actually rise above the immature comedy and leave you feeling oddly satisfied. Everything else is just filler.",4,In Sickness and in Wealth,1210896000,"05 16, 2008",2008,5482,"['What', 'Vegas', 'not', 'insightful', 'intelligent', 'movie', 'actually', 'juvenile', 'romantic',

Noting that Kutcher and Diaz were the leads I prepared to send my flat screen back to ESPN until the clever opening, I readily admit, hooked me.  Diaz's character (Joy, I believe) is throwing a surprise birthday party for her fiance--only to get dumped by him on their apartment threshold (in front of all their hiding friends).  And Kutcher's character (Jack, as I recall) has just been fired--by his father.  Accordingly, both Joy and Jack decide to throw caution to the wind and take a trip to Vegas, where they bump into each other, seriously partay. . .then all hades breaks lose.To my complete and utter surprise, this was a clever and engaging film.  Yes, Joy and Jack drunkenly tie the knot in Vegas, but before they can even say ""annulment"" Jack hits a $3 million jackpot--so the fight is on for this piece of the marital ""estate.""  A no-nonsense judge (Dennis Miller, as usual, is fantastic) orders them to work on their marriage for at least six months before he'll even consider awarding the money, so Joy moves in with Jack, and the battle of wills begins--often with very amusing results.  Diaz and Kutcher work well off one another (but don't get me wrong:  Kutcher is still annoying), but Rob Corddry as Kutcher's attorney steals every scene he's in and is worth the viewing of this movie all by his lonesome.Granted, the plot is hokey and the story predictable, Diaz does horse laugh and Kutcher annoys, yet WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS is surprisingly good.

It's who you're with, while you're doing it, that makes you happy.Having just experienced major disappointments in life and love, Jack (Ashton Kutcher of ""Just Married"" and ""My Boss's Daughter"") and Joy (Cameron Diaz of ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and ""The Holiday"") take their buddies and go to Sin City.  They meet, party, get wasted and are married in a chapel.  The next morning, both of them are regretfully thinking ""annulment.""  That would've been the end of the fairytale if Jack hadn't won a three million dollar jackpot.  Greedy boy wants it all to himself but Joy insists on splitting it because they are legally married.  Next, they appear before a judge who sentences them to six months of ""hard marriage"" before he will grant them a divorce.  Meanwhile, each one tries to drive the other crazy in hopes that they will beg for a quick divorce and forfeit their share of the loot.Talk about chemistry.  Kutcher and Diaz are like hydrogen and oxygen.  By themselves, their characters are dangerous; together they create life-giving water.  They are incredibly adorable and funny.  These two popular and extremely talented actors looked as though they had a great time making this film.  How I envy them.  In fact, everyone (leads and supporting cast) looked as though they were having fun.  It is the type of movie that will make you forget your worries for a couple of hours.""What Happens In Vegas"" is one of the best romantic comedies I've seen thus far this year.  It is highly recommended for fans of romantic comedies and fans of Diaz and Kutcher.  It reminded me much of ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" - another one of my favorites.  Also recommended is ""27 Dresses,"" ""The Wedding Planner,"" ""Maid in Manhattan,"" and ""While You Were Sleeping.""",5,"""What Happens In Vegas"" Stays In My Romantic Comedy DVD Collection",1243296000,"05 26, 2009",2009,1981,"['What', 'Vegas', 'very', 'sweet', 'tender-hearted', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'fairytale', 'ending', 'Two', 'socially', 'mismatched', 'people', 'find', 'true', 'meaning', 'happiness', 'not', 'what', 'do', 'living', 'happy', 'who', ""'re"", ""'re"", 'doing', 'happy.Having', 'just', 'experienced', 'major', 'disappointments', 'life', 'love', 'Jack', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Just', 'Married', 'Boss', 'Daughter', 'Joy', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Best', 'Friend', 'Wedding', 'Holiday', 'take', 'buddies', 'go', 'Sin', 'City', 'meet', 'party', 'get', 'wasted', 'are', 'married', 'chapel', 'next', 'morning', 'are', 'regretfully', 'thinking', 'annulment', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'end', 'fairytale', 'Jack', 'had', ""n't"", 'won', 'three', 'million', 'dollar', 'jackpot', 'Greedy', 'boy', 'Joy', 'splitting', 'are', 'legally', 'married', 'Next', 'appear', 'judge', 'who', 'six', 'months', 'hard', 'marriage', 'will', 'grant', 'divorce', 'Meanwhile', 'one', 'tries', 'drive', 'other', 'crazy', 'hopes', 'will', 'beg', 'quick', 'divorce', 'forfeit', 'share', 'loot.Talk', 'chemistry', 'Kutcher', 'Diaz', 'are', 'hydrogen', 'oxygen', 'characters', 'are', 'dangerous', 'together', 'create', 'life-giving', 'water', 'are', 'incredibly', 'adorable', 'funny', 'two', 'popular', 'extremely', 'talented', 'actors', 'looked', 'had', 'great', 'time', 'making', 'film', 'How', 'envy', 'fact', 'everyone', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'looked', 'were', 'having', 'fun', 'type', 'movie', 'will', 'make', 'forget', 'worries', 'couple', 'hours', 'What', 'Vegas', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'thus', 'far', 'year', 'highly', 'recommended', 'fans', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'fans', 'Diaz', 'Kutcher', 'reminded', 'much', 'How', 'Lose', 'Guy', '10', 'Days', 'one', 'favorites', 'Also', 'recommended', '27', 'Dresses', 'Wedding', 'Planner', 'Maid', 'Manhattan', 'Were', 'Sleeping']",N/A

1175182,A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N,B001C5LLPU,"Jonny Rotten ""even handed critic""","[2, 2]","Well, it is as much as I have predicted, a barely watchable comedy with mediocre stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher heading the cast. There were some funny moments, Kutcher either had the better lines or more experience in comedies where as Diaz's only real success at comedy started and ended with There's Something About Mary. Kutcher shouldn't have quit his day job and stayed on That 70's Show, he played the airheaded clueless and incredibly dumb part very well. I think he's trying to break out more into film, and I guess it's only a matter of time when he's given the right script? I can't recall the last really good film Diaz was ever in? Can't say Charlie's Angels, it was OK, but nothing special. What Happens in Vegas pretty much plays out the predictable story of two people who go to Vegas to forget out their personal troubles, get hammered (like many I expect) and end up married. Perhaps by fate, Kutcher pulls the handle and thus wins 3 million dollars. Well, now they are both in it for the money, but instead of being granted an annulment or a divorce, Judge Miller sentences them to 6 months hard marriage counseling. Some funny things happen that I got a kick out of. Both do horrible things to each other to make the other quit. Diaz ties up the bathroom for hours, Kutcher uses the sink for a toilet and ""Oh, by the way...it's your day to do dishes."" Plus the removal of the bathroom door and the toilet seat was classic. I'll have to remember than one for myself. In the end, both being to ""grow on one another"" but in its predictability and clich&eacute; story/screen play...What Happens in Vegas pretty much lost my full attention about half way through. Not terrible, but certainly not great by any stretch of the means. I can't recommend buying it, perhaps watching it out of curiosity...that' about as far as it goes. There are better comedies out there, and if you want to see a classic with a Vegas back drop, watch ""Honey Moon in Vegas"", a far funnier and more entertaining film... pure, classic Nicholas Cage comedy at its best.",2,What Happens in Vegas is the dumbing down of comedy...,1221091200,"09 11, 2008",2008,2066,"['Well', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'predicted', 'barely', 'watchable', 'comedy', 'mediocre', 'stars', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'heading', 'cast', 'were', 'funny', 'moments', 'Kutcher', 'had', 'better', 'lines', 'more', 'experience', 'comedies', 'where', 'Diaz', 'only', 'real', 'success', 'comedy', 'started', 'ended', 'Something', 'Mary', 'Kutcher', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'quit', 'day', 'job', 'stayed', '70', 'Show', 'played', 'airheaded', 'clueless', 'incredibly', 'dumb', 'part', 'very', 'well', 'think', 'trying', 'break', 'out', 'more', 'film', 'guess', 'only', 'matter', 'time', 'when', 'given', 'right', 'script', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'last', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'Diaz', 'was', 'ever', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'Charlie', 'Angels', 'was', 'OK', 'nothing', 'special', 'What', 'Vegas', 'pretty', 'much', 'out', 'predictable', 'story', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'go', 'Vegas', 'forget', 'out', 'personal', 'troubles', 'get', 'hammered', 'many', 'expect', 'end', 'up', 'married', 'Perhaps', 'fate', 'Kutcher', 'handle', 'thus', '3', 'million', 'dollars', 'Well', 'now', 'are', 'money', 'instead', 'being', 'granted', 'annulment', 'divorce', 'Judge', 'Miller', '6', 'months', 'hard', 'marriage', 'counseling', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'got', 'kick', 'do', 'horrible', 'things', 'other', 'make', 'other', 'quit', 'Diaz', 'up', 'bathroom', 'hours', 'Kutcher', 'sink', 'toilet', 'Oh', 'way', 'day', 'do', 'dishes', 'removal', 'bathroom', 'door', 'toilet', 'seat', 'was', 'classic', ""'ll"", 'have', 'remember', 'one', 'end', 'being', 'grow', 'one', 'predictability', 'clich', 'eacute', 'story/screen', 'play', 'What', 'Vegas', 'pretty', 'much', 'lost', 'full', 'attention', 'half', 'way', 'Not', 'terrible', 'certainly', 'not', 'great', 'stretch', 'means', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'buying', 'perhaps', 'watching', 'curiosity', 'as', 'far', 'are', 'better', 'comedies', 'there', 'want', 'see', 'classic', 'Vegas', 'back', 'drop', 'watch', 'Honey', 'Moon', 'Vegas', 'far', 'funnier', 'more', 'entertaining', 'film', 'pure', 'classic', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'comedy', 'best']",N/A
1175183,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B001C5LLPU,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[0, 2]","In a time when so many different crazy things are happening and there's something new every second.  Movies now a days have hit a low point.  I usually don't bother to rent new movies.  I should say I don't feel like wasting my money.  This time though I was very happy with my choice to rent.  I told my mother how good it was (she said she didn't think she would like it) and me, her and my step father are going to watch it tomorrow night.  Below I will tell you a little about the movie.  I don't want to give too much away so I will just give you enough so you can better understand the film.The cast has some pretty good actors in it.  The ensemble includes Ashton Kutcher.  Who has been in films like Butterfly effect 2004 and Guess Who 2005 and Cameron Diaz who we've seen in There's something about Mary 1998 and Charlie's Angles.  The movie also has two less well known (to me at least) actors.  They are Lake Bell who has been in shows such as Surface 2006, Boston Legal 2004-2006 and Rob Corddry who's been in things like Failure to Launch 2006 and Semi-Pro 2008.  You see Corddry and Bell throughout the film.  Corddry will probably make you laugh a lot of the times he is on.  Corddry has a brother who is an actor as well.  Hi name is Nathan Corddry.  He has not been in that many things as of yet though.  Look forward to seeing more with him in the future.  Also, Treat Williams who plays Jack Fuller Sr. or Jack Fullers father.  Williams is a well known actor who has been in many movies.  So while the cast may not be huge you will more than likely find (as I did) that it does nothing but help the movie.Now it's time to tell you a little about the movie.  It's about two people who are having a hard time with life.  One just lost his job and the other just broke up with her fianc&eacute;.  There friends talk them into going to Vegas in order to help them feel better.  Lucky for us they both decide to go.  By some misfourtion they just happen to be booked in the same room.  So we get two sets of friends staying in the same room.  They go to set things straight.  Diaz character talks first, yelling at the man at the desk.  She gets them two good rooms of there own.  Then Kutchers character goes up and talks and gets them V.I.P passes to places around the place they are staying.  They end up having a drink with each other and talking.  Diaz's character wakes up the next morning with a ring on her finger and a note that says were having breakfast.  She finds out they got married!They find out that each wants to break it up so they go to get a divorce.  During all this Kutchers character get a coin from Diaz character and wins 3 million in Vegas. The ownership comes to question.  They talk to a judge.  The judge (who is played by Dennis Miller) gets mad at them.  He tells them that they are what's wrong with America.  He forces them to stay married for 6 months.  While at the same time going through counseling he also puts a freeze on the winnings until the time is up.  If one asks to leave the marriage they will not get any of the money so they stay together.Throughout the movie many funny things happen.  Like Kutchers character taking the toilet seat off and Diaz character falling into the toilet.  At on point Kutchers character puts energy pills in Diaz characters drink.  Later you see her at work really hyper and freaking out. This may not sound that funny but when you see it I am sure you will find it otherwise. You will laugh and wonder what will happen.  Also, the movie does a good job of making itself available to those of a younger age.  It does so by watching the language.  There are parts when they could say some really bad stuff but tone it down.  Making it funny without any foul language at all.  I thought it was pretty cool of them.  There is some language though so parents check before the kids watch it.In the end you may get teary but you will have the feeling of seeing a good well balanced movie.  I was very happy with this film.  It's two actors that I have always liked and respect playing parts that make you happy in the end.  I would say this is a sure rental and for many a great buy.  I think those of all ages will find it entertaining.",4,"Happly, a very good movie.",1220054400,"08 30, 2008",2008,4222,"['time', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'crazy', 'things', 'are', 'happening', 'something', 'new', 'second', 'Movies', 'now', 'days', 'have', 'hit', 'low', 'point', 'usually', 'do', ""n't"", 'bother', 'rent', 'new', 'movies', 'should', 'say', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'wasting', 'money', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'choice', 'rent', 'told', 'mother', 'how', 'good', 'was', 'said', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'step', 'father', 'are', 'going', 'watch', 'tomorrow', 'night', 'will', 'tell', 'little', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'too', 'much', 'away', 'will', 'just', 'give', 'enough', 'can', 'better', 'understand', 'film.The', 'cast', 'pretty', 'good', 'actors', 'ensemble', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Who', 'been', 'films', 'Butterfly', 'effect', '2004', 'Guess', 'Who', '2005', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'who', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'something', 'Mary', '1998', 'Charlie', 'Angles', 'movie', 'also', 'two', 'less', 'well', 'known', 'least', 'actors', 'are', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'who', 'been', 'shows', 'such', 'Surface', '2006', 'Boston', 'Legal', '2004-2006', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'who', 'been', 'things', 'Failure', 'Launch', '2006', 'Semi-Pro', '2008', 'see', 'Corddry', 'Bell', 'film', 'Corddry', 'will', 'probably', 'make', 'lot', 'times', 'Corddry', 'brother', 'who', 'actor', 'as', 'well', 'Hi', 'name', 'Nathan', 'Corddry', 'not', 'been', 'many', 'things', 'yet', 'Look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'future', 'Also', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'who', 'Jack', 'Fuller', 'Sr.', 'Jack', 'Fullers', 'father', 'Williams', 'well', 'known', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'many', 'movies', 'So', 'cast', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'huge', 'will', 'more', 'likely', 'find', 'did', 'nothing', 'help', 'movie.Now', 'time', 'tell', 'little', 'movie', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'having', 'hard', 'time', 'life', 'One', 'just', 'lost', 'job', 'other', 'just', 'broke', 'up', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'talk', 'going', 'Vegas', 'order', 'help', 'feel', 'better', 'Lucky', 'decide', 'go', 'misfourtion', 'just', 'happen', 'be', 'booked', 'same', 'room', 'get', 'two', 'sets', 'friends', 'staying', 'same', 'room', 'go', 'set', 'things', 'straight', 'Diaz', 'character', 'talks', 'first', 'yelling', 'man', 'desk', 'two', 'good', 'rooms', 'own', 'Then', 'Kutchers', 'character', 'up', 'talks', 'V.I.P', 'places', 'around', 'place', 'are', 'staying', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'drink', 'other', 'talking', 'Diaz', 'character', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'ring', 'finger', 'note', 'were', 'having', 'breakfast', 'got', 'married', 'find', 'out', 'break', 'up', 'so', 'go', 'get', 'divorce', 'Kutchers', 'character', 'get', 'coin', 'Diaz', 'character', '3', 'million', 'Vegas', 'ownership', 'question', 'talk', 'judge', 'judge', 'who', 'played', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'mad', 'are', 'what', 'wrong', 'America', 'stay', 'married', '6', 'months', 'same', 'time', 'going', 'counseling', 'also', 'freeze', 'winnings', 'time', 'up', 'one', 'leave', 'marriage', 'will', 'not', 'get', 'money', 'stay', 'movie', 'many', 'funny', 'things', 'happen', 'Kutchers', 'character', 'taking', 'toilet', 'seat', 'Diaz', 'character', 'falling', 'toilet', 'point', 'Kutchers', 'character', 'energy', 'pills', 'Diaz', 'characters', 'drink', 'Later', 'see', 'work', 'really', 'hyper', 'freaking', 'out', 'may', 'not', 'sound', 'funny', 'when', 'see', 'am', 'sure', 'will', 'find', 'otherwise', 'will', 'laugh', 'wonder', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'Also', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'making', 'available', 'younger', 'age', 'so', 'watching', 'language', 'are', 'parts', 'when', 'could', 'say', 'really', 'bad', 'stuff', 'tone', 'down', 'Making', 'funny', 'foul', 'language', 'thought', 'was', 'pretty', 'cool', 'language', 'so', 'parents', 'check', 'kids', 'watch', 'end', 'may', 'get', 'teary', 'will', 'have', 'feeling', 'seeing', 'good', 'well', 'balanced', 'movie', 'was', 'very', 'happy', 'film', 'two', 'actors', 'have', 'always', 'liked', 'respect', 'playing', 'parts', 'make', 'happy', 'end', 'would', 'say', 'sure', 'rental', 'many', 'great', 'buy', 'think', 'ages', 'will', 'find', 'entertaining']",N/A

I found it both funny and romantic. My brother would call it a chick flick and he definitely likes chick flicks and this movie.So, is it any good? I've rented it twice and enjoyed it the second time as much as the first. I like Cameron Diaz and now I like Ashton Kutcher. OK, here's the deal. I liked him in ""Coast Guard"" with Kevin Costner (filmed in Shreveport). I like him in his camera commercials. He has enough money for his own production company. That unshaped hair has never been attractive, but in the party scene toward the end of the movie, Joy (Cameron) tells him he cleans up really nice. And he does! I've never found him attractive until then when he becomes quite the heart throb.The film has a silly premise to work with (but what about some of the romantic Cary Grant movies--weren't they called goofball comedies?). ""What Happens in Vegas"" happens because Joy has been dumped by an anal-retentive fiance; Jack (Ashton) has been dumped by his dad (fired). The two throw caution to the wind and go to Vegas with their friends to forget their troubles, meet, get drunk, have a heck of a time together, get married because they are too drunk to consider consequences, wake up, and discover reality. Then comes a three-million-dollar jackpot!The divorce judge (Dennis Miller with some hilarious lines) tells them they must stay together for six months before he will give them a divorce. During that time they must undergo marital counseling. Two people were never more different! Together for six months! It's a trial but one that has a 50-50 chance of working.(Judy judgment: I know this Indian couple whose marriage was arranged.  He did not go against his Indian heritage and protest the arrangement. He followed it and has a very happy marriage. It was their intention to make it work. Now consider how it is done in America. What is the chance of success--50-50.)After living together six months without the tension of intimacy, Jack and Joy end up knowing each other well, or at least each other's bad points, and inadvertently some of the good points--more than enough to build on.The old saying goes: Whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Not always. Not when you marry someone you just met. Can you salvage it? Do you dump it, too? Or do you find a judge who makes you make it work?I really like this movie!",4,"What happens in Vegas happens in my living room, too!",1229817600,"12 21, 2008",2008,2438,"['Call', 'weird', 'like', 'goofball', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'What', 'Vegas', 'definitely', 'goofball', 'found', 'funny', 'romantic', 'brother', 'would', 'call', 'chick', 'flick', 'definitely', 'chick', 'flicks', 'movie.So', 'good', ""'ve"", 'rented', 'twice', 'enjoyed', 'second', 'time', 'as', 'much', 'first', 'like', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'now', 'like', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'OK', 'here', 'deal', 'liked', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'Kevin', 'Costner', 'filmed', 'Shreveport', 'like', 'camera', 'commercials', 'enough', 'money', 'own', 'production', 'company', 'unshaped', 'hair', 'never', 'been', 'attractive', 'party', 'scene', 'end', 'movie', 'Joy', 'Cameron', 'up', 'really', 'nice', ""'ve"", 'never', 'found', 'attractive', 'then', 'when', 'quite', 'heart', 'throb.The', 'film', 'silly', 'premise', 'work', 'what', 'romantic', 'Cary', 'Grant', 'movies', 'were', ""n't"", 'called', 'goofball', 'comedies', 'What', 'Vegas', 'Joy', 'been', 'dumped', 'anal-retentive', 'fiance', 'Jack', 'Ashton', 'been', 'dumped', 'dad', 'fired', 'two', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'go', 'Vegas', 'friends', 'forget', 'troubles', 'meet', 'get', 'drunk', 'have', 'heck', 'time', 'together', 'get', 'married', 'are', 'too', 'drunk', 'consider', 'consequences', 'wake', 'up', 'discover', 'reality', 'Then', 'three-million-dollar', 'jackpot', 'divorce', 'judge', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'hilarious', 'lines', 'must', 'stay', 'together', 'six', 'months', 'will', 'give', 'divorce', 'time', 'must', 'undergo', 'marital', 'counseling', 'Two', 'people', 'were', 'never', 'more', 'different', 'Together', 'six', 'months', 'trial', 'one', '50-50', 'chance', 'working', 'Judy', 'judgment', 'know', 'Indian', 'couple', 'marriage', 'was', 'arranged', 'did', 'not', 'go', 'Indian', 'heritage', 'protest', 'arrangement', 'followed', 'very', 'happy', 'marriage', 'was', 'intention', 'make', 'work', 'Now', 'consider', 'how', 'done', 'America', 'What', 'chance', 'success', '50-50', 'living', 'together', 'six', 'months', 'tension', 'intimacy', 'Jack', 'Joy', 'end', 'up', 'knowing', 'other', 'well', 'least', 'other', 'bad', 'points', 'inadvertently', 'good', 'points', 'more', 'enough', 'build', 'on.The', 'old', 'saying', 'Vegas', 'stays', 'Vegas', 'Not', 'always', 'Not', 'when', 'marry', 'someone', 'just', 'met', 'Can', 'salvage', 'Do', 'dump', 'too', 'do', 'find', 'judge', 'who', 'make', 'work', 'really', 'movie']",N/A

And of course, Zach Galla-fa-nakis, who makes it impossible not to love.There are 2 rather corny scenes- when Diaz/Kuthcer are racing each other to their therapy session, and it gets a little weird around the business weekend trip. Other than that, it is a very well-written and well-acted film.

Well, this film doesn't stick quite to that phrase despite its title being the first half of it.  It brings what happens in Vegas to New York.  Meeting thanks to a hotel screw-up, Joy McNally, played by Cameron Diaz, Jack Fuller, played by Ashton Kutcher, Toni ""Tipper"" Saxson, played by Lake Bell, and Jeffrey ""Hater"" Lewis, played by Rob Corddry, meet up and decide to have some fun together.  Within the drunken debauchery, Joy and Jack, the film's main characters, end up married and regret it during their ""hangovers"" the next morning.  In an attempt to get an amicable divorce, they wind up fighting over a three million jackpot Jack won with a quarter Joy gave him.  A judge back in New York, played by Dennis Miller, decides that, before he will consider the idea of a divorce and the splitting of the ""marital assets"", the couple has to try to make their marriage work, with a marriage counselor, played by Queen Latifah.  From there, hijinks ensue as each tries to outdo the other, along with their totally biased friends, ""Tipper"" and ""Hater"", so they can keep the full jackpot.  Okay, legal inaccuracies aside, and this film has more of those than an episode of Law and Order, this was pretty good.  All the characters were well cast and quite funny, though I'd have liked to see more of Lake Bell as she was my favorite...how'd her character get the nickname ""Tipper"" anyway?  I think the actors were actually drunk for some of the wild Vegas scenes and I do wish the crew had gotten shots of the real-life hangovers the next day.  Overall, the premise is amusing (surely it's happened in real life at one of those Vegas wedding chapels), the jokes are never overdone and the film instead lets the situation bring out the funny as a good comedy should.  Despite me not being a big fan of either lead and knowing even less about them, I thought they were worth watching.  And I was pleasantly surprised to see Dennis Farina in this film.  I didn't know he did comedy...he did pretty well here.  I'll just end things now by stamping my positive recommendations onto the film.

1175205,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B001C5LLPU,RMurray847,"[1, 1]","Here's another great example of a movie that will scarcely stay in your memory long enough to last for the ride home.  It is a pleasant diversion that provides nothing new and very little in the way of something clever.  You can predict the twists and turns of this movie pretty much down to the minute.A romantic comedy of this sort requires good rapport between its performers.  If a trifle of a film like this doesn't generate good chemistry (Ralph Fiennes & Jennifer Lopez, Matthew McConnaghy and Sarah Jessica  Parker spring to mind), then it is doomed, because the shallowness and unlikeliness of the plot are exposed to the blinding glare of light.  When two stars really click, the blinding light becomes a pleasant candle, and we ignore the ""stupid"" stuff (Hugh Grant & Julia Roberts, for example...heck Hugh Grant and just about anyone).WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS falls somewhere between.  Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher make an okay couple...but they are burdened by their characters both being more immature than we might like.  The best couples are full-blown adults who become childlike in their love...or childlike adults who mature into an adult couple (KNOCKED UP being a recent, outstanding example).  Diaz and Kutcher remain stubbornly immature throughout.Diaz is a high-strung control freak with a stressful job (she plays a trader on the floor of the exchange...boy, I sure didn't believe her for one second in that occupation), who, following a horrible break-up embarrassment, allows her friend (Lake Bell) to convince her to blow off some steam in Vegas.  Kutcher is a lazy, immature carpenter who gets fired by his own father after goofing-off at work for the umpteenth time.  To blow off steam, his best friend (Rob Corddry) suggests they head to Vegas.  A mistake at the front desk has these two mis-matched pairs suddenly sharing the same hotel room.  The hotel fixes the mistake and provides them with all sorts of freebies...so they all head off together to get really drunk at really high-end clubs.  Kutcher and Diaz end up married by the end of the night!!  (You might consider this stuff to be spoilers...but in my opinion, there's almost nothing I've mentioned here that isn't covered in the trailers for the film.)The unique twist this film offers is that the couple agrees it was all a mistake and decide to divorce quietly.  Unfortunately, Diaz  provides Kutcher with the quarter that wins $3 million on the slot machine...and neither person is willing to give up a dime of the winnings.  A judge tells them they have to live together and work on their marriage for 6 months before he'll grant a divorce.  ""Hilarity ensues,"" as they sometimes say.From this point, the plot creaks along very predictably...with the two leads trying really hard to make us care.  We don't.  They are charming individually (Kutcher, in particular, does well), but as a couple we want to see together...we just shrug our shoulders.Other strong points...Lake Bell and Rob Corddry as the two friends have a very interesting hate/hate relationship that clearly has roots in a physical attraction neither wants to admit.  They are funny together in their insults and mockery.  Often the characters of the ""best friend"" are little more than sounding boards for the lead characters.  Corrdry and Bell are a nice exception.  Bell, in particular, is an unusual and interesting actress.  Corrdry is much better here than in his over-the-top caricature of a Homeland Security Agent in HAROLD & KUMAR ESCAPE GUANTANIMO.Weak spots:  Dennis Miller as the marriage-loving judge couldn't be worse in the role.  It's terribly written, the rulings he delivers don't really make sense and Miller clearly knows this.  He's thinking ""Just get me through this and give me my check.""  Also, what the heck is Queen Latifah doing as their marriage counselor?!?!  She's unconvincing as well, trying to tone down her natural exuberance to seem ""professional.""  Lastly, Dennis Farina, as Diaz's boss is a poorly thought out throwback to the `50s.  A boss like him wouldn't last in this day and age, because he's a horrible manager of people.One final thought...does everyone who lives in Brooklyn have a great apartment that's within spitting distance of the Brooklyn Bridge?

Zwick,"[1, 2]","**SPOILERS**The question before us is this:  would you stay married to a person you'd just recently met  (and whom you could barely stand) if you knew that, after six months as a couple, you would be free to go your separate ways and - here's the really good part - be handed a prize of $3,000,000 for your trouble?  If that sounds like the setup for yet another of those preposterously cheesy TV reality shows, think again.  It's actually the premise of ""What Happens in Vegas,"" a big-budget romantic comedy starring Ashton Kutcher and Catherine Diaz as two Manhattanites who get more than they bargained for when they head to Sin City for an emotional pick-me-up after suffering major traumas in their lives.  Jack has recently been fired from his carpentry job (by his own father no less), while Joy has suffered the humiliation of being dumped by her fiance in front of all their mutual friends.  When the two strangers meet, it's instant pandemonium, thanks to an adjoining hotel bathroom, an abundance of free-flowing liquor, some quickie nuptials and a slot-machine jackpot worth $1.5 million dollars per person.Just how this couple winds up getting hitched - and why so much money is involved in the outcome - need not be detailed here. All you need to know is that ""What Happens in Vegas"" plays out with all the cliches one would expect from a romantic comedy, as Jack and Joy hurl objects and invective at one another until, as if by magic, it suddenly dawns on them how truly, madly, deeply in love with each other they are and that maybe, with a little teamwork and effort, they could make this marriage thing work for real.  To complete the totality of the clich&eacute;, both Jack and Joy are saddled with best friends (Rob Corddry and Lake Bell, respectively) who function as wacky, wisecracking sidekicks - and who help them pull off all the insufferably inane, mean-spirited tricks the principal characters play on each other.  Jason Sudeikis, Queen Latifah, Dennis Miller and Treat Williams also put in appearances, though my suspicion is that they`d be more than happy to have this particular turkey expunged from their acting resumes toot sweet.The sad fact is that it's a mite difficult to develop a rooting interest in a relationship in which the two individuals display all the wit and emotional maturity of a couple of developmentally-disabled five-year-olds.  The lower these two otherwise attractive people stoop in their treatment of one another, the more disheartening - and less funny - the movie itself becomes.",2,another lamebrained romantic comedy,1240358400,"04 22, 2009",2009,2541,"['**SPOILERS**The', 'question', 'would', 'stay', 'married', 'person', ""'d"", 'just', 'recently', 'met', 'whom', 'could', 'barely', 'stand', 'knew', 'six', 'months', 'couple', 'would', 'be', 'free', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'here', 'really', 'good', 'part', 'be', 'handed', 'prize', '3,000,000', 'trouble', 'setup', 'yet', 'preposterously', 'cheesy', 'TV', 'reality', 'shows', 'think', 'again', 'actually', 'premise', 'What', 'Vegas', 'big-budget', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'Catherine', 'Diaz', 'two', 'Manhattanites', 'who', 'get', 'more', 'bargained', 'when', 'head', 'Sin', 'City', 'emotional', 'pick-me-up', 'suffering', 'major', 'traumas', 'lives', 'Jack', 'recently', 'been', 'fired', 'carpentry', 'job', 'own', 'father', 'no', 'less', 'Joy', 'suffered', 'humiliation', 'being', 'dumped', 'fiance', 'front', 'mutual', 'friends', 'When', 'two', 'strangers', 'meet', 'instant', 'pandemonium', 'thanks', 'adjoining', 'hotel', 'bathroom', 'abundance', 'free-flowing', 'liquor', 'quickie', 'nuptials', 'slot-machine', 'jackpot', '1.5', 'million', 'dollars', 'person.Just', 'how', 'couple', 'up', 'getting', 'hitched', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'money', 'involved', 'outcome', 'need', 'not', 'be', 'detailed', 'here', 'All', 'need', 'know', 'What', 'Vegas', 'out', 'cliches', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Jack', 'Joy', 'hurl', 'objects', 'invective', 'one', 'magic', 'suddenly', 'how', 'truly', 'madly', 'deeply', 'love', 'other', 'are', 'maybe', 'little', 'teamwork', 'effort', 'could', 'make', 'marriage', 'thing', 'work', 'real', 'complete', 'totality', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Jack', 'Joy', 'are', 'saddled', 'best', 'friends', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'respectively', 'who', 'function', 'wacky', 'wisecracking', 'sidekicks', 'who', 'help', 'pull', 'off', 'insufferably', 'inane', 'mean-spirited', 'tricks', 'principal', 'characters', 'play', 'other', 'Jason', 'Sudeikis', 'Queen', 'Latifah', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'also', 'put', 'appearances', 'suspicion', 'd', 'be', 'more', 'happy', 'have', 'particular', 'turkey', 'expunged', 'acting', 'resumes', 'toot', 'sweet.The', 'sad', 'fact', 'mite', 'difficult', 'develop', 'rooting', 'interest', 'relationship', 'two', 'individuals', 'display', 'wit', 'emotional', 'maturity', 'couple', 'developmentally-disabled', 'five-year-olds', 'lower', 'two', 'otherwise', 'attractive', 'people', 'stoop', 'treatment', 'one', 'more', 'disheartening', 'less', 'funny', 'movie']",N/A

If you're tight on money, and even if you aren't, you'd probably find this one is a rental at best and not something that is crying for permanent addition to most video collections.Diaz and Kutcher do well enough with the material they're given, but that material is all too predictable and all too familiar for most viewers.  Take two pretty people and their friends and send them to Las Vegas after they've both experienced life changing events, have them cross paths accidentally and then get together for alcohol fueled partying until, surprise! surprise!, the two lead characters wake up to find themselves married.  The story could end right there, but gee, there's a lot more film to go, so here comes the convenient plot twist that keeps these two from separating until after they've made it past their mandatory time living as husband and wife.Will they stay together?  Can they live with each other at all or will the habits of the single caveman permanently and totally offend the beauty that he's been paired with?Honestly, again, if you are considering this one go rental first.

1175218,A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F,B001C5LLPU,"Terrance Richard ""Terry Richard""","[0, 0]","I purchased this film because I love Ashton Kutcher. I had no idea, however, the movie was this good. His chemistry with Cameron Diaz is excellent, and the script is hilarious and funny, with many surprises thrown in. More than a date movie, it's really a movie about human behavior, and what brings two people, who are polar opposites, together.The film is about two people who end up in Las Vegas, for very different reasons, and discover one morning they are married after having too many cocktails. When Jack, played by Ashton, puts a twenty five cent coin of Joy's, Diaz's character, into a slot machine, they win three million dollars. Neither wants to be particularly married to one another, as they are so different in many ways, so they sue each other for the money, and thats where the fun begins.This is probably one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in years, and you don't have to be a Ashton or Cameron fan to like this. What makes the film work is the script, the locations of Vegas and New York, which is shot beautifully, and the sheer chemistry of the leads. Hopefully they will do a sequel to the movie.The film came in second on it's first week of release, culminating over $200,000,000 at the world-wide boxoffice. A certified hit.I own all of Ashton's films, and this is one of the best he's ever done.There are also two DVD releases of the film: the bare bones DVD that has the movie only, and the deluxe 2 DVD edition with a ton of bonuses, including commentary, deleted scenes, and more.Sit back for ninety minutes, have fun, and forget about your problems and enjoy a fantastic film with two fantastic stars.",5,"""One of the Best Romantic/Comedies Ever!""",1239494400,"04 12, 2009",2009,1642,"['purchased', 'film', 'love', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'had', 'idea', 'however', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'chemistry', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'excellent', 'script', 'hilarious', 'funny', 'many', 'surprises', 'thrown', 'More', 'date', 'movie', 'really', 'movie', 'human', 'behavior', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'polar', 'opposites', 'together.The', 'film', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'end', 'up', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'discover', 'one', 'morning', 'are', 'married', 'having', 'too', 'many', 'cocktails', 'When', 'Jack', 'played', 'Ashton', 'twenty', 'five', 'cent', 'coin', 'Joy', 'Diaz', 'character', 'slot', 'machine', 'win', 'three', 'million', 'dollars', 'be', 'particularly', 'married', 'one', 'are', 'so', 'different', 'many', 'ways', 'sue', 'other', 'money', 'thats', 'where', 'fun', 'begins.This', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'have', 'seen', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'be', 'Ashton', 'Cameron', 'fan', 'like', 'What', 'film', 'work', 'script', 'locations', 'Vegas', 'New', 'York', 'shot', 'beautifully', 'sheer', 'chemistry', 'leads', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'do', 'sequel', 'movie.The', 'film', 'came', 'second', 'first', 'week', 'release', 'culminating', '200,000,000', 'world-wide', 'boxoffice', 'certified', 'hit.I', 'Ashton', 'films', 'one', 'best', 'ever', 'are', 'also', 'two', 'DVD', 'releases', 'film', 'bare', 'bones', 'DVD', 'movie', 'only', 'deluxe', '2', 'DVD', 'edition', 'ton', 'bonuses', 'including', 'commentary', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'more.Sit', 'back', 'ninety', 'minutes', 'have', 'fun', 'forget', 'problems', 'enjoy', 'fantastic', 'film', 'two', 'fantastic', 'stars']",N/A
1175219,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B001C5LLPU,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[1, 2]","""What Happens in Vegas,"" the comedy starring Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher, is a story built on a ludicrous premise and laden with romantic comedy clich&eacute;s, sparkly dental work, and frenetic acting.  It's the kind of movie that makes you wonder, ""What could they have been thinking?""Commodities trader Joy McNally (Diaz) has just been dumped by her boyfriend.  Jack Fuller (Kutcher) has just been fired from his job by his own father (Treat Williams).  Hooking up with their respective best friends, Tipper (Lake Bell) and Hater (Rob Corddry), Joy and Jack head for Las Vegas to put their troubles on the back burner and cut loose.  Joy and Jack meet each other, hit it off, get falling-down drunk, and wake up the next morning to discover they've been married.  Now sober, they both realize they made a terrible mistake and agree to dissolve the marriage.All changes, however, when Jack puts Joy's quarter into a slot machine and wins its $3 million jackpot.  They argue over whose money it is until Jack reminds Joy that, because they're married, the money belongs to both of them.  They go to court to argue ownership of the money and have a divorce granted, but the judge (Dennis Miller) orders them to stay married for six months.If you're wondering, ""Why don't they just split the dough and go their separate ways?"" you have far more common sense than the script writers.  When a movie is based on so flimsy a premise, it's very hard to get on board for the ride, especially when there is enough ineptness for three bad movies here.The viewer knows not only precisely how the film will wind up, but how the journey will progress.  There are few surprises, no twists, just the interminable waiting for the movie to end.Diaz has been effective in other comedies, most notably ""Something About Mary.""  She has a bright, sunny personality that can make her character shine when the material is first class.  With lesser material, she tries hard, overacts in the hope of punching up lame gags, and is strident.  Her Joy is never believable, and we never accept for a nanosecond that she has the brains to be a top stock trader.Kutcher, who rose to fame on the TV sitcom ""That 70's Show"" playing a lovable dim bulb, is going down the path of career suicide by accepting role after similar role in substandard, dumb comedies like this one.  He has the makings of a long career in film.  He's good looking, has that hard-to-define star quality, and is likable.  But he has failed to branch out into more diverse parts, even after showing some real acting chops in ""The Butterfly Effect"" a few years ago.  His Jack is standard sitcom issue.  We see he's a screw-up at the company his dad runs, but never understand why.  He drinks a lot, but this is played solely for comic effect.  If the movie is about the quest to find one's true self, it never addresses why the principals are lost in the first place.The secondary characters Tipper and Hater, who have an ongoing love/hate relationship, are on hand for additional laughs, yet their repartee seems more mean-spirited and sour than funny.  Their timing is way off, and neither knows when to underplay a line or let the camera create a punchline.  They're hampered by weak material, never given an extended scene of their own, and relegated to limp one-liners.  Ms. Bell and Mr. Corddry should watch a few Astaire-Rogers films to see how to alternateattraction and repulsion comically.  They were masters at it.""What Happens in Vegas"" is rated PG-13 for some crude language and scenes of irresponsible drinking.",2,"Lame idea, charming leads",1221955200,"09 21, 2008",2008,3569,"['What', 'Vegas', 'comedy', 'starring', 'Cameron', 'Diaz', 'Ashton', 'Kutcher', 'story', 'built', 'ludicrous', 'premise', 'laden', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'clich', 'eacute', 'sparkly', 'dental', 'work', 'frenetic', 'acting', 'kind', 'movie', 'wonder', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'thinking', 'Commodities', 'trader', 'Joy', 'McNally', 'Diaz', 'just', 'been', 'dumped', 'boyfriend', 'Jack', 'Fuller', 'Kutcher', 'just', 'been', 'fired', 'job', 'own', 'father', 'Treat', 'Williams', 'Hooking', 'up', 'respective', 'best', 'friends', 'Tipper', 'Lake', 'Bell', 'Hater', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Joy', 'Jack', 'head', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'put', 'troubles', 'back', 'burner', 'cut', 'loose', 'Joy', 'Jack', 'meet', 'other', 'hit', 'off', 'get', 'falling-down', 'drunk', 'wake', 'up', 'next', 'morning', 'discover', ""'ve"", 'been', 'married', 'Now', 'sober', 'realize', 'made', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'agree', 'dissolve', 'marriage.All', 'changes', 'however', 'when', 'Jack', 'Joy', 'quarter', 'slot', 'machine', '3', 'million', 'jackpot', 'argue', 'money', 'Jack', 'Joy', ""'re"", 'married', 'money', 'go', 'court', 'argue', 'ownership', 'money', 'have', 'divorce', 'granted', 'judge', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'orders', 'stay', 'married', 'six', 'months.If', ""'re"", 'wondering', 'Why', 'do', ""n't"", 'just', 'split', 'dough', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'have', 'far', 'more', 'common', 'sense', 'script', 'writers', 'When', 'movie', 'based', 'so', 'flimsy', 'premise', 'very', 'hard', 'get', 'board', 'ride', 'especially', 'when', 'enough', 'ineptness', 'three', 'bad', 'movies', 'here.The', 'viewer', 'not', 'only', 'precisely', 'how', 'film', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'how', 'journey', 'will', 'progress', 'are', 'few', 'surprises', 'twists', 'just', 'interminable', 'waiting', 'movie', 'end.Diaz', 'been', 'effective', 'other', 'comedies', 'most', 'notably', 'Something', 'About', 'Mary', 'bright', 'sunny', 'personality', 'can', 'make', 'character', 'shine', 'when', 'material', 'first', 'class', 'lesser', 'material', 'hard', 'overacts', 'hope', 'punching', 'up', 'lame', 'gags', 'strident', 'Joy', 'never', 'believable', 'never', 'accept', 'nanosecond', 'brains', 'be', 'top', 'stock', 'trader.Kutcher', 'who', 'rose', 'fame', 'TV', 'sitcom', '70', 'Show', 'playing', 'lovable', 'dim', 'bulb', 'going', 'down', 'path', 'career', 'suicide', 'accepting', 'role', 'similar', 'role', 'substandard', 'dumb', 'comedies', 'one', 'makings', 'long', 'career', 'film', 'good', 'looking', 'hard-to-define', 'star', 'quality', 'likable', 'failed', 'branch', 'out', 'more', 'diverse', 'parts', 'even', 'showing', 'real', 'acting', 'chops', 'Butterfly', 'Effect', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Jack', 'standard', 'sitcom', 'issue', 'see', 'screw-up', 'company', 'dad', 'runs', 'never', 'understand', 'why', 'lot', 'played', 'solely', 'comic', 'effect', 'movie', 'quest', 'find', 'one', 'true', 'self', 'never', 'why', 'principals', 'are', 'lost', 'first', 'place.The', 'secondary', 'characters', 'Tipper', 'Hater', 'who', 'have', 'ongoing', 'love/hate', 'relationship', 'are', 'hand', 'additional', 'laughs', 'repartee', 'more', 'mean-spirited', 'sour', 'funny', 'timing', 'way', 'knows', 'when', 'underplay', 'line', 'let', 'camera', 'create', 'punchline', ""'re"", 'hampered', 'weak', 'material', 'never', 'given', 'extended', 'scene', 'own', 'relegated', 'limp', 'one-liners', 'Ms.', 'Bell', 'Mr.', 'Corddry', 'should', 'watch', 'few', 'Astaire-Rogers', 'films', 'see', 'how', 'alternateattraction', 'repulsion', 'comically', 'were', 'masters', 'What', 'Vegas', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'crude', 'language', 'scenes', 'irresponsible', 'drinking']",N/A

After getting drunk and spending a night together in Las Vegas, Jack (Ashton Kutcher) and Joy (Cameron Diaz) discover they are married. Next morning they start to hate each other quarrelling in a casino, but the couple must spend six months together as lawfully wedded husband and wife - required by the court order - before they are allowed to use the 3 million dollar jackpot they won.The film's story unfolds more like a farce in the earlier chapters with jokes and gags based on their incongruous combination of personalities, perfectionist and slacker. The jokes include Cameron Diaz's lecture on how to use the toilet. They are not quite original, but are funny.After the main characters stop acting like a child and begin to look at each other more seriously, ""What Happens in Vegas"" becomes really a romantic comedy. The screenplay has nothing new to add to the overcrowded genre, but the chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher somehow draws you in.Still, even those who love this film will admit the script is pretty messy at times. It is slightly off-putting (even with the star power of Diaz and Kutcher) to see a man and a woman fighting over $ 3 million when all they have to do is just split the money and part. In the Vegas scenes the hero and the heroine are not only unlikable; they are unlikely. The film gets better as it goes on, but the contrived set-up clearly needs improvement.Some supports are good, others just forgettable. Rob Corddry steals scenes from the leads as Jack's bumbling friend giving him kindly (but often silly) advice. Queen Latifah also appears as a psychiatrist, but sadly her character has no function in the plot. She just sits and smiles and says nothing interesting. Other supports include Lake Bell, Dennis Farina, Treat Williams, Zach Galifianakis and Dennis Miller as one of the most impossible judges in movie history.""What Happens in Vegas"" is an average Hollywood romantic comedy with the absolutely unrealistic premise you must keep forgetting.
