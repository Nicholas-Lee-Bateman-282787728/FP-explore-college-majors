Strongly influenced by John Wyndham, it's a quiet, thoughtful examination of the consequences of a plague several orders of magnitude worse than the bubonic plague, though there's plenty of action as well. The only thing missing are triffids.  The writing is generally good, and the show moves along quickly, particularly in the early episodes.  The thing I liked best was the mixture of survivor types, some good, some bad, and most in between.  All have weaknesses. Everybody's pretty clueless about what to do next.  In the second season, the show goes all introspective and loses its way.  The survivors settle in a rustic community where they have little to do but figure out how to farm and take care of livestock.  Since there's little contact with the outside world, several of the episodes deal with personality conflicts among the people living in the small community.  Most of the episodes are instantly forgettable, with the exception of two London based episodes that were probably from left over first season scripts. The third season is a little more exciting as the main characters leave their little community and wander all over England dodging rabid dogs in order to make endless speeches about the need to restore civilization.  There are a few memorable episodes, one of which deals with rabies and another a particularly virulent form of smallpox.In its defense, the show never loses its smarts, but most of the excitement drains out of it.  If you like post-apocalyptic scenarios, it's worth a watch at least through the first season.  It is far superior to the recent remake, but it's not all that it's cracked up to be.",3,"After a strong start, fades quickly",1276732800,"06 17, 2010",2010,1722,"['Rarely', 'show', 'hit', 'skids', 'so', 'quickly', 'first', 'season', 'quite', 'good', 'Strongly', 'influenced', 'John', 'Wyndham', 'quiet', 'thoughtful', 'examination', 'consequences', 'plague', 'several', 'orders', 'magnitude', 'worse', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'plenty', 'action', 'well', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'are', 'triffids', 'writing', 'generally', 'good', 'show', 'along', 'quickly', 'particularly', 'early', 'episodes', 'thing', 'liked', 'best', 'was', 'mixture', 'survivor', 'types', 'good', 'bad', 'most', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'Everybody', 'pretty', 'clueless', 'what', 'do', 'next', 'second', 'season', 'show', 'introspective', 'way', 'survivors', 'settle', 'rustic', 'community', 'where', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'farm', 'take', 'care', 'livestock', 'little', 'contact', 'outside', 'world', 'several', 'episodes', 'deal', 'personality', 'conflicts', 'people', 'living', 'small', 'community', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'instantly', 'forgettable', 'exception', 'two', 'London', 'based', 'episodes', 'were', 'probably', 'left', 'over', 'first', 'season', 'scripts', 'third', 'season', 'little', 'more', 'exciting', 'main', 'characters', 'leave', 'little', 'community', 'wander', 'England', 'dodging', 'rabid', 'dogs', 'order', 'make', 'endless', 'speeches', 'need', 'restore', 'civilization', 'are', 'few', 'memorable', 'episodes', 'one', 'deals', 'rabies', 'particularly', 'virulent', 'form', 'smallpox.In', 'defense', 'show', 'never', 'smarts', 'most', 'excitement', 'like', 'post-apocalyptic', 'scenarios', 'watch', 'least', 'first', 'season', 'far', 'superior', 'recent', 'remake', 'not', 'cracked', 'up', 'be']",N/A

1332562,A3H4EV4UMST3HV,B0038MUZCK,steve b,"[3, 3]","Remade a couple of years ago the first version is still the bestThe plot line is simple a plague, called simply the Death, has killed off 4,999 people in every 5,000 The population of Great Britain has fallen from 60 million to 10,000. We learn later in the series that the population of Cairo is only 12. The first series follows two women (Jennie and Abbie) and one man (Gregg) who seek to start a new life and struggle for the basics of life, food, shelter and clothing. They cannot get these things from cities as they have become no go areas infested with rats, dogs and piles of dead bodies.The first series' most distressing episode is however not about the struggle to find food and shelter, but how do you administer justice in a world without law. A group of survivors try a simple minded man for murder. If he is guilty what do they do with him? There are no prisons; they cannot exile him from the group as he cannot survive without them. Is their only choice to kill him? even in countries with the death penalty he would have not been executed because of his mental state. If they decide to kill him who will do it?In the second series Abbie goes off in search of her son and Jennie and Gregg merge their settlement with another community led by Charles who becomes the shows main figure by series three.The show does have a number of faults, everyone is a bit to clean and we are told early in the series that modern man has fewer skills than stone age man. Yet a lot of the survivors appear to have useful skills, Gregg is an engineer, Charles is an architect and other people who turn up are bee keepers, herbalists or have other skills. Also we are told that no two persons who knew each other survived the death, yet later in the series whole families appear to have survived.This being a British series from the Seventies, the middle class survivors are the ones who get things done, while the working class survivors are feckless and need their social betters to boss them around.The show's main problem is however that it cannot decide if it needs to concentrate on how you survive, how do you grow your own food? How do you pull a tooth with no medicines? or does it become an adventure series with heroes battling bad guys who have come to plunder. The show treads an uneasy path between the two trends. This is acknowledged in series three when Jennie calls Charles a little boy for going off on adventures instead on concentrating on the farm.Survivors is however a first rate drama which poses some questions which with luck we will never have to answer. How do you preserve meat, even if you have salt? How do you make an axe when the last one is broken? What do you do about having children in a world where most babies will die before they are five and there are no contraceptives?Most of all what would you do if you had survived the death.
