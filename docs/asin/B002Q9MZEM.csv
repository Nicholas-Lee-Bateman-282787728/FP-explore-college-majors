I think it's incredible that they were able to do what they did to not only repair it, but to enhance it. The sheer number of variables to consider, the things that could go wrong, it was amazing that it went right.You get to see the testing of the procedures on Earth. From the beginning, they had a lot of odds stacked against them (i.e. the designers of the Hubble had passed away so they had to rely on any notes and files that they had). Obstacle after obstacle came about but remarkably, was overcome (shows the incredible power of the human will). The amount of stress that was on the engineers and the astronauts is not something I would wish on someone I considered distasteful.

1283659,A14OJS0VWMOSWO,B002Q9MZEM,Midwest Book Review,"[7, 8]","Originally broadcast as an episode of NOVA, Hubble's Amazing Rescue is a behind-the-scenes documentary of the extraordinary astronauts and engineers who worked together to save the famous Hubble Space Telescope, an artifact that has contributed enormously to scientific knowledge in the past twenty years. After two decades, Hubble's gyroscopes and sensors were failing; its batteries were running down; and some of its instruments were already dead. A mission to save it had been cancelled in 2004 due to excessive risk to the astronauts. Previous missions had offered replacement parts, but now two of the run-down instruments, a camera and a spectrograph, had no available replacements. It took five careful spacewalks to revive the telescope and fortify it to be sent back into space, anywhere from 10 to 70 times more powerful than when it was first launched.
