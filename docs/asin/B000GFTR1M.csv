1003520,A29TKSIWA3JKF3,B000GFTR1M,Einsatz,"[0, 0]","Murder Ahoy has the distinction of being just an ""interpretation"" of Miss Marple (the inspiration coming from They Do It With Mirrors).  It begins as they all do, with a murder.  In this case, a man is snuffed out with snuff.  As with the other installments in the Rutherford series, she comes up against the sanctimonious Inspector Craddock (Charles `Bud' Tingwell), who manages to become more disagreeable as the films progressed in spite of the fact that Miss Marple is always correct.As the title suggests, this film takes place at sea (or near enough as the ship in question is anchored in a harbor not far from shore).  Always underappreciated, Miss Marple is loath to deal with a bombastic Captain (wonderfully played by Lionel Jeffries as an insufferable blowhard).  He wants her off his ship but she will have her way and snoops to her heart's content.Favorite scene, the indomitable Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) joining in a rousing rendition of Rule Britannia (if not in good voice, at least in the spirit of it).  Also loved it when she hauled out her chemistry set to discover the poison involved.  No end of fun.",5,"""Run through then hung.

1003521,A2GA2SO3YK6CXI,B000GFTR1M,"Esperanza Reynolds ""Hope Reynolds""","[4, 4]","There is nothing better than seeing old movies. Their simplicity and lack of special effects made acting an art, and what is better than to see a good Agatha Christie mystery unfold before our eyes?In Murder Ahoy, we see a chief inspector of police that needs lots of help to solve a murder that takes place... on land and on to sea... Miss Marple is part of the board of trustees of a ship. One of the trustees wants to reveal something he discovered while on board, but he is murdered by a poisonous substance placed in his snuff... and as he draws the powdered tobacco into his nostrils, we see him succumb to the killers plot.Miss Marple suspects the death was not by natural causes as the doctor has ruled, and she takes a sample of the snuff, which by coincidence was left on the paper she had on the conference table, and with the assistance of her chemistry set... for girls, she sets out to discover what substance was used.As usual, Miss Marple comes across as a bit eccentric, her artful way to conceal that she is a sleuth on skirt and high heels. She suspects that what the murdered board of trustee member wanted to talk about has to do with something he discovered while on board, and she decides to spend a few days on the ship to discover what that is. Such fun to see her displace the captain by taking his quarters as her abode, and to see the rank and file displace those beneath her... until they all move from room to room to allow a superior to receive better space...Well, the film will leave you enchanted with such nice detective work, conducted during a time where it was all done by the intelligence and deductive powers of individuals who had no access to computers, finger prints, or laboratories. You will enjoy lots of British humor as you watch Miss Marple take them all on, and at some point, she even duels the murderer... We thoroughly enjoyed this episode of yet another awesome Agatha Christie mystery.

1003524,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,B000GFTR1M,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[1, 1]","Nothing is serious in this criminal detective and private eye story. It is all humor, oh no, fun really. But who is getting the fun out of the story? Agatha Christie? For sure, and she even manages to put a direct allusion at her famous dramatic success in London for more years than anyone else, The Mousetrap. But she is making fun at a bishop, a lord and a few other social entities. And she enjoys it enormously. But we could wonder if it is not Miss Marple who is making fun of all these heavy heads and straight jacketed minds. We would be right too. She obviously makes fun of the poor detective inspector or chief inspector, of the captain, of a few more people in the dear society of Winchester. She appears as an eccentric, and she cultivates that appearance because one has to keep up appearances and because that's her true hallmark and method to capture the attention of those she wants not to see what she is really doing. To go inconspicuous, this Miss Marple knows we have to go very visible. But it could also be Margaret Rutherford who is enjoying herself at our expense, and there too I think we have a point. She seems to be enjoying herself so much that she could be God himself come down incognito. This film is a little gem of such nice detective suspense laced and stuffed with a lot of British or English humor, with a lot of tongues in a lot of cheeks. Quite  interesting if we consider it as a remnant and a testimony of a time when computers did not exist and scientific police was not yet a glimmer in the eye of an administrative law and order progenitor. And we managed to arrest criminals in those days when we did not even have a computer to process and identify finger prints.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",5,Funnier than me you die,1216166400,"07 16, 2008",2008,1846,"['Nothing', 'serious', 'criminal', 'detective', 'private', 'eye', 'story', 'humor', 'oh', 'fun', 'really', 'who', 'getting', 'fun', 'story', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'sure', 'even', 'put', 'direct', 'allusion', 'famous', 'dramatic', 'success', 'London', 'more', 'years', 'anyone', 'else', 'Mousetrap', 'making', 'fun', 'bishop', 'lord', 'few', 'other', 'social', 'entities', 'enormously', 'could', 'wonder', 'not', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'who', 'making', 'fun', 'heavy', 'heads', 'straight', 'jacketed', 'minds', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'too', 'obviously', 'fun', 'poor', 'detective', 'inspector', 'chief', 'inspector', 'captain', 'few', 'more', 'people', 'dear', 'society', 'Winchester', 'eccentric', 'appearance', 'one', 'keep', 'up', 'appearances', 'true', 'hallmark', 'method', 'capture', 'attention', 'not', 'see', 'what', 'really', 'doing', 'go', 'inconspicuous', 'Miss', 'Marple', 'have', 'go', 'very', 'visible', 'could', 'also', 'be', 'Margaret', 'Rutherford', 'who', 'enjoying', 'expense', 'there', 'too', 'think', 'have', 'point', 'be', 'enjoying', 'so', 'much', 'could', 'be', 'God', 'come', 'down', 'incognito', 'film', 'little', 'gem', 'such', 'nice', 'detective', 'suspense', 'laced', 'stuffed', 'lot', 'British', 'English', 'humor', 'lot', 'tongues', 'lot', 'cheeks', 'Quite', 'interesting', 'consider', 'remnant', 'testimony', 'time', 'when', 'computers', 'did', 'not', 'exist', 'scientific', 'police', 'was', 'not', 'yet', 'glimmer', 'eye', 'administrative', 'law', 'order', 'progenitor', 'managed', 'arrest', 'criminals', 'days', 'when', 'did', 'not', 'even', 'have', 'computer', 'process', 'identify', 'finger', 'prints.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne', 'University', 'Versailles', 'Saint', 'Quentin', 'Yvelines']",An Agatha Christie's Miss Marple Mystery Movie: Murder Ahoy

Boarding the ship, HMS Battledore, she soon finds out that things are positively fishy! Somebody about the Battledore is hiding something, and they are prepared to use murder to keep their secret. [Black and White, released in 1964, with a running time of 1 hour, 33 minutes.]I must admit that my wife and I chanced across this Miss Marple movie after having become great fans of Joan Hickson's interpretation of the role, and were not too happy with it. Later, however, having accepted that this is not Joan Hickson's Miss Marple, but accepting it for its self, we came to love this movie. Margaret Rutherford brings a real presence to the role, adding a touch of humor, and making the story (not actually written by Agatha Christie, but a good mystery nonetheless) quite entertaining.So, if you like a good mystery, or if you like old movies, then I highly recommend this movie to you.
