1051163,AJVFPC26GHXGF,B000MV8ACC,"Amanda Felix ""angelbuff""","[2, 3]",This one is a good movie if you like the coming of age teen movies. Lance Hienrikson is a great teacher and role model for the kids that are out in the wilderness to learn more about themselves and how they view the world and how the world views them. Everyone one of them is put to the test when it comes to testing their stregnth and weakness and with a surprise as to who is the strongest of them all.,3,Good adventure movie,1257984000,"11 12, 2009",2009,404,"['one', 'good', 'movie', 'like', 'coming', 'age', 'teen', 'movies', 'Lance', 'Hienrikson', 'great', 'teacher', 'role', 'model', 'kids', 'are', 'out', 'wilderness', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'view', 'world', 'how', 'world', 'Everyone', 'one', 'put', 'test', 'when', 'testing', 'stregnth', 'weakness', 'surprise', 'who', 'strongest']",Survival Quest
1051164,A1GHUN5HXMHZ89,B000MV8ACC,"C. A. Luster ""The Rook""","[1, 1]",This is a gem that has slipped by many people including myself until recently when I rented it. I have always enjoyed survival movies but this one ranks among some of the best I have seen and yet word of mouth has not given it the credit due. To be honest I am not a big fan of the other movies advertised with it includingPhantasm. In fact I was prepared to shut off the movie based on the pre-movie trailers as I thought it might be a gorefest. I was glad I gave it a chance as Lance Henriksen and the rest the cast do a great job in this survival adventure. A small group signs on for a survival trek into the wilderness at the same time a paramilitary group is conducting drills with weapons. When the two groups clash things get dicey since the survivalist don't have weapons and must rely on each other to make it out alive. There are some injuries but the bloodletting is minimal and done well. Realistically handled it doesn't stretch outside the realm of believability. I am not sure why the R rating as only one short bare breasts scene and a little violence doesn't seem to warrant that rating to me. If you enjoy survival movies or adventures I recommend you give it a chance. If you enjoyed this be sure to catchThe River Wild.CA Luster,4,Survival Quest,1279152000,"07 15, 2010",2010,1249,"['gem', 'slipped', 'many', 'people', 'including', 'recently', 'when', 'rented', 'have', 'always', 'enjoyed', 'survival', 'movies', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'seen', 'yet', 'word', 'mouth', 'not', 'given', 'credit', 'due', 'be', 'honest', 'am', 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'other', 'movies', 'advertised', 'fact', 'was', 'prepared', 'shut', 'off', 'movie', 'based', 'pre-movie', 'trailers', 'thought', 'might', 'be', 'gorefest', 'was', 'glad', 'gave', 'chance', 'Lance', 'Henriksen', 'rest', 'cast', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'survival', 'adventure', 'A', 'small', 'group', 'signs', 'survival', 'trek', 'wilderness', 'same', 'time', 'paramilitary', 'group', 'conducting', 'drills', 'weapons', 'When', 'two', 'groups', 'clash', 'things', 'get', 'dicey', 'survivalist', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'weapons', 'must', 'rely', 'other', 'make', 'out', 'alive', 'are', 'injuries', 'bloodletting', 'minimal', 'done', 'well', 'Realistically', 'handled', ""n't"", 'stretch', 'realm', 'believability', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'R', 'rating', 'only', 'one', 'short', 'bare', 'breasts', 'scene', 'little', 'violence', ""n't"", 'seem', 'warrant', 'rating', 'enjoy', 'survival', 'movies', 'adventures', 'recommend', 'give', 'chance', 'enjoyed', 'be', 'sure', 'catchThe', 'River', 'Wild.CA', 'Luster']",Survival Quest

1051167,A1MNUAXPWP8BUJ,B000MV8ACC,mr. contrarian,"[0, 0]",This is basically one camera and two groups of actors in the woods inventing a story as they go along.  Each group is led by their own &#34;expert survivalist.&#34;  One instructor is full of heart and courage and the other is a psychotic bully.  What makes this unintentionally hilarious is that the &#34;bad&#34; group is promptly given assault rifles to act out bizarre grudges on the strangers and each other.  I promise that if you keep watching this turd sandwich until the end you will be laughing and cheering at the screen.  It's cheesy yet sincere in a way that was only possible in the 1980's.,4,So Bad It's Good,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,604,"['basically', 'one', 'camera', 'two', 'groups', 'actors', 'woods', 'inventing', 'story', 'go', 'along', 'group', 'led', 'own', '34', 'expert', 'survivalist.', '34', 'One', 'instructor', 'full', 'heart', 'courage', 'other', 'psychotic', 'bully', 'What', 'unintentionally', 'hilarious', '34', 'bad', '34', 'group', 'promptly', 'given', 'assault', 'rifles', 'act', 'out', 'bizarre', 'grudges', 'strangers', 'other', 'promise', 'keep', 'watching', 'turd', 'sandwich', 'end', 'will', 'be', 'laughing', 'cheering', 'screen', 'cheesy', 'yet', 'sincere', 'way', 'was', 'only', 'possible', '1980']",Survival Quest
1051168,A221XWNYJZX863,B000MV8ACC,"Paul A. Klinger ""weather nut""","[2, 3]","I had seen this in VHS when it first became available around 1990.  As Iwas a big fan of Don Coscarelli, the director, because of his early films""Kenny and Co."", and ""Phantasm"", as well as his first feature ""Jim, theWorld's Greatest"" (not available), I bought and rewatched this film, which probablywould not have interested me had I not known who made it.  As it turnedout, it is better than many of his recent efforts, though somewhat uneven.  It concerns a group of average and fully believable adults who decide to take a survivalcourse in the Sierras, and little known to them, a competing survivalistgroup led by a jerk much like the bully teacher in ""The Karate Kid"".  Theensuing events are tense, violent, but at times silly and overdone to thepoint of absurdity.  It would have been better if the mean guys weren'tquite so evil and childish.  Still, an entertaining movie if you are inthe mood for an undemanding, but often exciting and interesting study ofwhat survivalist courses may be like, at least regarding the first of the two.",3,uneven fight for survival,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,1044,"['had', 'seen', 'VHS', 'when', 'first', 'became', 'available', '1990', 'Iwas', 'big', 'fan', 'Don', 'Coscarelli', 'director', 'early', 'films', 'Kenny', 'Co.', 'Phantasm', 'as', 'well', 'first', 'feature', 'Jim', 'theWorld', 'Greatest', 'not', 'available', 'bought', 'rewatched', 'film', 'not', 'have', 'interested', 'had', 'not', 'known', 'who', 'made', 'better', 'many', 'recent', 'efforts', 'somewhat', 'uneven', 'group', 'average', 'fully', 'believable', 'adults', 'who', 'decide', 'take', 'survivalcourse', 'Sierras', 'little', 'known', 'competing', 'survivalistgroup', 'led', 'jerk', 'much', 'bully', 'teacher', 'Karate', 'Kid', 'Theensuing', 'events', 'are', 'tense', 'violent', 'times', 'silly', 'thepoint', 'absurdity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'mean', ""weren'tquite"", 'so', 'evil', 'childish', 'Still', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'are', 'inthe', 'mood', 'undemanding', 'often', 'exciting', 'interesting', 'study', 'survivalist', 'courses', 'may', 'be', 'least', 'regarding', 'first', 'two']",Survival Quest
