1067870,A2F1FP9DWAWMNB,B000P0J010,Amazon Customer,"[1, 1]",The backdrop is a beautiful scene on the ocean. The instructor gives pretty good tips and how-to's. She likes to say 'Yes?' Instead of OK. She is a wee bit cheesy but maybe that's a part of being a spinning instructor. The music is Casio-style with a weak beat. Don't buy the video for the music. She uses a few real life scenarios with footage to give you a visual and it's helpful but these scenes are only shown for a few seconds here and there. I work out to this video because I can't force myself to spin in the higher intensity ranges on my own - need to be pushed. It would be a perk if the music were akin to what you would get in a spinning class.She is good at getting you to work hard. I don'the regret buying this video. Spinning videos are kinda at the caliber of what workout videos were in the 90's. The bar just isn't quite that high but hopefully in a few years we'll see some really good spinning videos out there for those of us who hate to wait in line reserve a spot on a bike at the gym.,3,"good instruction -a bit cheesy, music worse than elevator music",1261612800,"12 24, 2009",2009,1010,"['backdrop', 'beautiful', 'scene', 'ocean', 'instructor', 'pretty', 'good', 'tips', 'how-to', 'say', ""'Yes"", 'Instead', 'OK.', 'wee', 'bit', 'cheesy', 'maybe', 'part', 'being', 'spinning', 'instructor', 'music', 'Casio-style', 'weak', 'beat', 'Do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'video', 'music', 'few', 'real', 'life', 'scenarios', 'footage', 'give', 'visual', 'helpful', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'shown', 'few', 'seconds', 'here', 'there', 'work', 'out', 'video', 'ca', ""n't"", 'force', 'spin', 'higher', 'intensity', 'own', 'need', 'be', 'pushed', 'would', 'be', 'perk', 'music', 'were', 'akin', 'what', 'would', 'get', 'spinning', 'class.She', 'good', 'getting', 'work', 'hard', ""don'the"", 'regret', 'buying', 'video', 'Spinning', 'videos', 'are', 'kinda', 'caliber', 'what', 'videos', 'were', '90', 'bar', 'just', ""n't"", 'quite', 'that', 'high', 'hopefully', 'few', 'years', ""'ll"", 'see', 'really', 'good', 'spinning', 'videos', 'out', 'there', 'who', 'hate', 'wait', 'line', 'reserve', 'spot', 'bike', 'gym']",Mindy Mylrea: Super Cycle: The Best Ride in Town

Fun scenarios (don't remember if the dog chases you in this one or her other one- but it sure made me increase my pedal speed).  Great workout; you can decrease the time you spend or go all out with this one.Combine this with the Robert Sherman ones (he gets more into the physiology of the ride)- Mindy's is probably more fun.

1067874,A2V5R832QCSOMX,B000P0J010,Leanne,"[1, 1]","This workout is a lot of fun, and it's definitely challenging!  Mindy has a fun personality, and she keeps you working hard during the workout.  Some workouts are boring and make you watch the clock the entire time, but this is not one of them.There are three segments in this workout: a hill segment (with three increasingly longer and more challenging hills), an interval segment, and a steady state/flat segment.  If you do all three segments and the warm-up and cool down, it comes to about 70 minutes total.  The cool down stretching is also excellent; she really takes the time to stretch out your legs and upper body.I also liked how the first hill segment cut into clips of a dog chasing you and other cyclists that you are trying to catch up with; it was a fun way to break up the otherwise beautiful scenery.This is also a serious calorie-torcher.  I'm about 5'4"" and weigh 115 pounds, and my HRM said I burned about 570 calories by doing the whole workout.
