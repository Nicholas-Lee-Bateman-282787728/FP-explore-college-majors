1322090,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B0034G4OWM,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 12]","""For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: Clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers. So when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head ... I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None.""- George Carlin from his standup special ""Life is Worth Losing""Given this depressingly nihilistic viewpoint, there's a good chance Carlin would have enjoyed ""Furry Vengeance,"" not only because nature strikes back, but also because it strikes in the most unbelievably juvenile and inane ways. He always did enjoy excess. I'm sure he would have laughed each time Brendan Fraser found himself in a car full of skunks, which spray him in amounts so vast, the car appears to be filled with fog. And what about the scene where he gets trapped in a port-o-potty, which is tossed around by a bear until it ends up in a tree, and is then found the next morning and opened by a construction crew? We don't see Fraser in that shot, but the shock on everyone else's face tells us everything we need to know. Oh yes. I'm sure Carlin would have loved that. Nature struck back. Man got what he deserved.But enough about Carlin. Let's talk about Fraser, who's not only the star of ""Furry Vengeance"" but is also one of the executive producers. What was it about this project that prompted him to get it financed? Did he enjoy the jokes that were stretched beyond the breaking point despite not being funny to begin with? Did he relish the idea of humiliating himself on the screen, as when his character finds himself without clothing and is forced to wear his wife's pink sweats, the pants of which have the words ""yum yum"" written on the rear end? Perhaps he was blindsided by the film's message of saving the environment and being kind to our woodland friends. Of course, it's a very good, very relevant message, and I support it wholeheartedly. But there's nothing to be gained by sending it in this particular way. Activism should be encouraged through facts; it should not be at the mercy of filmmakers with four-year-old mentalities.This is a desperately unfunny movie - so unfunny that it doesn't even inspire incredulous laughter. It's an idiotic family comedy so contrived, goofy, broad, sappy, and strained that watching it is downright painful. It makes not the slightest effort in the ways of characterization, plot, or even basic entertainment. Fraser plays Dan Sanders, a Chicago real estate developer; he and his family have moved into a forest community, where he can oversee the construction of homes in an area teeming with wildlife. His wife, Tammy (Brooke Shields), and teenage son, Tyler (Matt Prokop), were happier in Chicago and spend the entire movie making him feel terrible. This is especially true of Tyler, who sulks and back-talks before meeting his school's student librarian (Skyler Samuels) and becoming an environmental activist.Naturally, the animals that live in the forest aren't too happy about what Sanders is taking part in. But then a raccoon gets wind of the second phase of development, conceived of by Sanders' condescending boss, Neal Lyman (Ken Jeong): A forest themed shopping mall. And because Sanders caves in to Lyman's demands, the raccoon and his legion of woodland creatures declare war on him. Thus begins a series of scenes in which animals of all sorts do everything they can to make his life a living hell. Some tactics are more psychological, like a bird that repeatedly taps on his bedroom window as he tries to sleep. Strange that Tammy is unable to hear it; she is, after all, in the same room as her husband. Other tactics are physical - punching, clawing, urinating, biting, stealing his clothes, and even feats of pure fantasy, such as when the raccoon and a family of skunks hotwire his car and go on a joyride. In the end, he always ends up embarrassing himself, especially in front of his family, who, of course, think he's going crazy.In between moments of moronic slapstick are throwaway gags that have no business being in the movie. Take, for example, an obnoxious security guard (Alexander Chase) who appears at Tammy's doorstep every time her husband goes missing; he's always disappointed whenever Sanders reappears because he no longer has any reason to accuse Tammy of murder. And then there's Mrs. Martin, the elderly schoolteacher (Alice Drummond); when Tammy begins coordinating an annual forest festival, Mrs. Martin enthusiastically remembers that she loves painting pinecones. That's about the only thing she remembers. Ha ha, the old woman is going senile.Oh, what an awful movie. Who thought making it was a good idea? Who read the screenplay and found it funny? Who deluded themselves into believing that it was appropriate for children? Judging by the fact that no child or adult in the audience laughed, it seems ""Furry Vengeance"" was made with no one in mind - save, maybe, for bitter misanthropes who get a thrill from watching animals get back at their two-legged oppressors. Why was Fraser involved with it? Is he at a point now where he's artistically bankrupt? ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and ""Extraordinary Measures"" were no masterpieces, but they were a lot better than this. Why was Shields involved? Is she not more established?

1322091,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B0034G4OWM,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[0, 1]","According to Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and every site with a Critics' avg. score, ""Furry Vengeance"" is the lowest point in Brendon Fraser's career, and regressed his status to the level of ""Encino Man"".  It's true that he wasn'tdoingwellas of recent, but this is the movie that will severely damage his reputation?  For some people, it probably is, and this movie certainly acquires a particular taste.  To prove a point, here are some of the movie antics done by the woodland creatures:- a raccoon and a skunk hotwiring and driving an SUV- a weasel building a Rude Goldberg-esque trap to roll a large rock on an unsuspecting vehicle- multiple skunks inexplicably hiding in the same SUV so they can surprise the victim and blow their gasket on him- the same raccoon pulling a plug on an active treadmill while someone's using it, where he will trip and hit a wall- a bear pushing around a porta-potty with a man inside (and inexplicably ripped the guy's pants off), and somehow moved the porta-potty on top of a tree)If those antics made you slap your hands to your face (is that what the cool kids call a 'facepalm'?), then stop reading this review, ignore this movie, huddle up in your nice blanket in front of the TV and watch the surprisingly-good-by-Dreamworks-standards""Over The Hedge"" instead.Here's the tale of the furry fiasco. Dan Sanders (Fraser) relocated his wife (Brooke Shields) and angsty teen to a wilderness location to do some construction work for new housing.  Later, he was ordered by his Asian boss with an American name, Mr. Lyman (Ken Jeong), to destroy a large forest so the company will build a large suburbia.  That posed a serious threat to the habitable beings of the forest who realized this plan, and so all the animals brought FURious malevolence against Dan; cue the hilarity.  Oh, and the film has something to do with saving the forest, preserving the wildlife, and whatever.  I don't care if people are barking on rescuing trees, I'm here to find entertainment.The film's humor depended entirely on two things: pratfalls and people yelling (Dan Sanders: ""MILEY CIRUS!""). Fortunately for this film, I'm a fan of LOUD NOISES, but while the absurd pratfalls get the job done, they did overstayed their welcome after a while. There's also the recurring joke that Dan is the only character who knows that he's being terrorized by territorial furries, and everyone thinks he's bonkers. I got along with this joke at first, but soon I had to wonder if the other characters were simply in denial. At one scene, there's a crow that keeps knocking on Dan's window and he keeps hearing, but his wife must've have her ears blocked if she couldn't hear such an obviously loud noise. The previously-mentioned porta-potty on top of the tree scene was even more baffling, as his family and his constructing crew saw just that; they still don't believe him, but they should at least think of a possibility that there might be shenanigans involved.The cast obviously go to the Looney Tunes school of acting for this movie. Brendon Fraser goes into his usual Fraser-mode, acting nervous and overly-pitchy for most of his lines; whether you find that charming or annoying is up to you. The other cast just goes along with the over-acting camaraderie. I'm not sure what to think of Jeong's performance; sometimes, he bickers in a fake superficial Asian language and I don't know if that's suppose to be insulting.  Probably not, since he has the habit in doing this since ""Knocked Up"".But after all is said and done, I have to admit I actually had a good time with ""Furry Vengeance"".  Yes, this film used the bare basics of comedy, and the vengeance aspect does go on way too long for something so simple like a cry for help, not to mention how insipid the whole arrangement is. But because of how utterly absurd the animals acted, and how over-the-top the acting is, the accumulated ridiculousness made the film mildly-enjoyable.  I did glee for some of the antics, and I had a chuckle for one unpredictable scene.  It had some amusing characters like the security guy played by Toby Hoss, and at one point, he was as close to acting like Artie that a""Pete & Pete""fan like myself has gotten in a long time.

Even the animals were confused on whether thy should be talking animals as in fiction or real animals as in documentary series. So, the moviemaker made the animal imagine with cartoons posted next to their brains. As the moviemaker herself was also confused on how to assign roles to the animals. Even though animals are as intelligent as humans in fendinf for themsleves, the tricks used in the movie appeared artificial.The theater of the movie actions was very limited to the rural home and a deserted road. When you try to sort out whether the developer was psychotic with illusion about animals or depressed with guilt about keeping a lucrative job at the expense of ruining the beauty of the forest, you would not be able to connect the development of affairs from the beginning to the end. Assumingly, the developer had a rude awaking due to his son's girlfriend sharp criticism of his hostility to the forest and animals. Or, the animal unionized upheaval to haunted the developer in his wakefulness and dreams and turned him insane.  Neither of the two causes seemed to have been played coherently.In ""Extraordinary Measures"", you would smoothly reason with Brendan Fraser's move to deal with his dying daughter and his keen awareness of the shortness of time remaining to enjoy her before her inevitable pending death.  In ""Furry Vengeance"", Brendan Fraser did every unimaginable and unreasonable act to fill the movie with boring comedy. Walking on the slanted roof of his house to scare a bird away, wearing his wife's pink wear to show his rear ends, throwing his wife's personal papers to quiet an annoying bird, ... all appeared in the form of coercive acting.Al Gore quickly jumped to mind with the facial likeness between him and Brendan Fraser.  Even the boring jokes of Al Gore and his monotonous approach to conflicts made me think that Brendan Fraser was made to be serious person and his transformation to comedy should have been calculated more cautiously.",2,"Very disappointing, boring, and fragmented.",1272758400,"05 2, 2010",2010,2376,"['Extraordinary', 'Measures', 'combined', 'science', 'humanity', 'art', 'masterpiece', 'mediocrity', 'Furry', 'Vengeance', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'made', 'fatal', 'mistake', 'selling', 'skin', 'flesh', 'few', 'bucks', 'comedy', 'was', 'primitive', 'boring', 'Fraser', 'not', 'appear', 'harbor', 'comical', 'spontaneity', 'actor', 'actress', 'movie', 'few', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'roles', 'Even', 'animals', 'were', 'confused', 'thy', 'should', 'be', 'talking', 'animals', 'fiction', 'real', 'animals', 'documentary', 'series', 'So', 'moviemaker', 'made', 'animal', 'imagine', 'cartoons', 'posted', 'next', 'brains', 'moviemaker', 'herself', 'was', 'also', 'confused', 'how', 'assign', 'roles', 'animals', 'Even', 'animals', 'are', 'as', 'intelligent', 'humans', 'fendinf', 'themsleves', 'tricks', 'used', 'movie', 'appeared', 'artificial.The', 'theater', 'movie', 'actions', 'was', 'very', 'limited', 'rural', 'home', 'deserted', 'road', 'When', 'try', 'sort', 'out', 'developer', 'was', 'psychotic', 'illusion', 'animals', 'depressed', 'guilt', 'keeping', 'lucrative', 'job', 'expense', 'ruining', 'beauty', 'forest', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'connect', 'development', 'affairs', 'beginning', 'end', 'Assumingly', 'developer', 'had', 'rude', 'awaking', 'due', 'son', 'girlfriend', 'sharp', 'criticism', 'hostility', 'forest', 'animals', 'animal', 'unionized', 'upheaval', 'haunted', 'developer', 'wakefulness', 'dreams', 'turned', 'insane', 'two', 'causes', 'seemed', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'coherently.In', 'Extraordinary', 'Measures', 'would', 'smoothly', 'reason', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'move', 'deal', 'dying', 'daughter', 'keen', 'awareness', 'shortness', 'time', 'remaining', 'enjoy', 'inevitable', 'pending', 'death', 'Furry', 'Vengeance', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'did', 'unimaginable', 'unreasonable', 'act', 'fill', 'movie', 'boring', 'comedy', 'Walking', 'slanted', 'roof', 'house', 'scare', 'bird', 'away', 'wearing', 'wife', 'pink', 'wear', 'show', 'rear', 'throwing', 'wife', 'personal', 'papers', 'quiet', 'annoying', 'bird', 'appeared', 'form', 'coercive', 'acting.Al', 'Gore', 'quickly', 'jumped', 'mind', 'facial', 'likeness', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'Even', 'boring', 'jokes', 'Al', 'Gore', 'monotonous', 'approach', 'conflicts', 'made', 'think', 'Brendan', 'Fraser', 'was', 'made', 'be', 'serious', 'person', 'transformation', 'comedy', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'calculated', 'more', 'cautiously']",N/A

1322115,ABBBP0HLLXJZ9,B0034G4OWM,"Rhonda Poynter ""gannon'smom""","[5, 7]","So, my friend has a review on here, too, and she felt that my original review was too short and not explanatory enough as to why I hated this movie, and my kid didn't think all that much of it. I said, Well, we'll watch it again with the five year old I'm sitting, and I'll get back to you. I'm back, and here are some of the problems with this movie - and I am not writing it as to what I like or dislike as an adult, I am writing about it as a parent. Big difference. Firstly, this is so badly written, and it makes the fatal mistake of kids' movies - as far as I am concerned - of making the characters and even the animals if not flat out mean, as characters you won't really care about. The animals are all very generic - there's a raccoon, a skunk, a bear and alot of birds with gastric difficulties, and they go after Brendon Fraser's character, Dan, because he works for a company that is going to take them off their preserve. The movie opens with the animals - live action, by the way, and they don't talk like in most films along this vein -, running a boorish, cigar smoking loudmouth over a cliff, car and all. The five year old watching this with my son and I the second time never cracked a smile, and asked about ten minutes later, ""Did the guy in the car get out okay?"" Either make it cartoonish humor, like ""Roger Rabbitt""  did, showing that the guy suffered a couple of lumps on the head, etc., or don't put it in. Okay, the movie then goes on for ninety minutes about these animals making Brendon's life miserable; they bang on his window all night, lock him in an outhouse, etc. etc., and it is greatly the fault of the writers, but none of it's funny. Brendon is a jerk, his son and wife are borderline cardboard, and everyone else in the movie is, yes, now the word 'mean' works. Even a young girl, thrown into the script because there was nothing else to come up with, is a smart-mouth for no discernable reason, and I'm lookin' at the clock, it's only halfway over, and neither my kid nor Heather are laughing. Other reviewers note the 'cheap' look - it's a right on the money description, and the other problem is that nothing seems to follow the thread of the movie from beginning to end. There's a couple of thought balloons dropped in over the animals' heads, and then that's it. I think that this would have been so much better had the animals spoke (but then again, they talked up a storm in MARMADUKE and I didn't care for that one, either), or even parodied their own behavior, again, like Roger Rabbitt. The only time both kids laughed was at the dream scene, and it was cute, clever and - about forty seconds long. And so, that's why I gave this movie one star, and if I didn't make that clear in my first review, my apologies. But I stand by that first review as a parent, and I didn't like the snippiness of the characters, the fact that everybody was either already a jerk or on their ways to being jerks, and I didn't like the fact that it didn't make it's target audience - little kids - laugh. At the very end of the movie, after the words ""The End"" are on the screen, there's a short clip of an owl getting his fortune told (Don't ask). The owl listens and then voices his opinion of the reading, in a human voice - Heather looked up at me and said, ""Now why didn't they make all the other animals talk? That would have been funny!""
