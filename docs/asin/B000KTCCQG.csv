1035604,A3PERVDBNCQJQV,B000KTCCQG,"Brian R Yandle ""Brian R Yandle""","[2, 3]","Favorite Movie Quote: ""He's got a little weird since his Mother committed suicide!""I know this is telling my age but I am actually old enough to remember seeing this one at the local mall in 1983 with my mom. I was almost nine years old back then & I'm quite sure my mom was anything but thrilled with this film. Actually, I think she thought it was an ok film but simply believed that I was much too young to see it. Needless to say, I remembered the film fondly & even rented the VHS tape many moons ago. Mortuary was exactly the way I remembered it.Fans of Bill Paxton SHOULD take note: This is perhaps one of his earliest roles & people who are familiar with his resume already know that Bill owns every role he accepts. This time, he really goes overboard with his character making this one of his most entertaining roles in my opinion. Paxton plays a geek who works for his father as an embabler in the local morgue, listens to Mozart, & fantasizes about the day he will marry his childhood crush Christy (Mary McDonough).On the other hand, his father (played brilliantly by the late Christopher George) holds cult meetings where the members of his group chant & dance. Interesting family, eh? Ironically, Christy's mother also partakes in these bizarre meetings which could also suggest that she may also have some foul part in the recent murder.Christy, however, has become obsessed with the recent tragic death of her father. As a result of this traumatic experience, she suffers from nightmares & sleepwalks. Convinced without a doubt that her father's death wasn't a mere accident, Christy is determined with the help of her boyfriend (David Wallace) to solve this mystery & to finally comes to terms with the truth. Naturally, no one buys her claims of a ghoulish paint-faced killer lurking in the shadows either & Christy begins to distrust everyone after discovering her mother belongs to a coven of witches.Mortuary may not be the greatest slasher film of all-time but there some pretty incredible moments &  decent performances from familiar faces both young or old. Trust me, there are quite a few creepy moments & even some rather cool death scenes which include embalming equipment. Fans of early 80's slasher flicks should give this one a try.Sadly, this one is not yet available on DVD to the best of my knowledge but I'm hoping this will come to pass. In the meantime, you can probably rent it from the old-fashioned VHS rental stores or look for used VHS tapes on Ebay. I am shocked that Code Red, Anchor Bay, or Blue Underground have not already released this little gem as a North American DVD release is long overdue.",4,Some Things Shouldn't Stay Buried,1309219200,"06 28, 2011",2011,2643,"['Favorite', 'Movie', 'Quote', 'got', 'little', 'weird', 'Mother', 'committed', 'suicide', 'know', 'telling', 'age', 'am', 'actually', 'old', 'enough', 'remember', 'seeing', 'one', 'local', 'mall', '1983', 'mom', 'was', 'almost', 'nine', 'years', 'old', 'back', 'then', ""'m"", 'quite', 'sure', 'mom', 'was', 'anything', 'thrilled', 'film', 'Actually', 'think', 'thought', 'was', 'ok', 'film', 'simply', 'believed', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'young', 'see', 'Needless', 'say', 'remembered', 'film', 'fondly', 'even', 'rented', 'VHS', 'tape', 'many', 'moons', 'ago', 'Mortuary', 'was', 'exactly', 'way', 'remembered', 'it.Fans', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'SHOULD', 'take', 'note', 'perhaps', 'one', 'earliest', 'roles', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'familiar', 'resume', 'already', 'know', 'Bill', 'role', 'time', 'really', 'overboard', 'character', 'making', 'one', 'most', 'entertaining', 'roles', 'opinion', 'Paxton', 'geek', 'who', 'father', 'embabler', 'local', 'morgue', 'Mozart', 'day', 'will', 'marry', 'childhood', 'crush', 'Christy', 'Mary', 'McDonough', '.On', 'other', 'hand', 'father', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'late', 'Christopher', 'George', 'cult', 'meetings', 'where', 'members', 'group', 'chant', 'dance', 'Interesting', 'family', 'eh', 'Ironically', 'Christy', 'mother', 'also', 'bizarre', 'meetings', 'could', 'also', 'suggest', 'may', 'also', 'have', 'foul', 'part', 'recent', 'murder.Christy', 'however', 'become', 'obsessed', 'recent', 'tragic', 'death', 'father', 'result', 'traumatic', 'experience', 'nightmares', 'sleepwalks', 'Convinced', 'doubt', 'father', 'death', 'was', ""n't"", 'mere', 'accident', 'Christy', 'determined', 'help', 'boyfriend', 'David', 'Wallace', 'solve', 'mystery', 'finally', 'terms', 'truth', 'Naturally', 'one', 'claims', 'ghoulish', 'paint-faced', 'killer', 'lurking', 'shadows', 'Christy', 'distrust', 'everyone', 'discovering', 'mother', 'belongs', 'coven', 'witches.Mortuary', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'greatest', 'slasher', 'film', 'all-time', 'pretty', 'incredible', 'moments', 'decent', 'performances', 'familiar', 'young', 'old', 'Trust', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'creepy', 'moments', 'even', 'rather', 'cool', 'death', 'scenes', 'include', 'embalming', 'equipment', 'Fans', 'early', '80', 'slasher', 'flicks', 'should', 'give', 'one', 'try.Sadly', 'one', 'not', 'yet', 'available', 'DVD', 'best', 'knowledge', ""'m"", 'hoping', 'will', 'come', 'pass', 'meantime', 'can', 'probably', 'rent', 'old-fashioned', 'VHS', 'rental', 'stores', 'look', 'used', 'VHS', 'tapes', 'Ebay', 'am', 'shocked', 'Code', 'Red', 'Anchor', 'Bay', 'Blue', 'Underground', 'have', 'not', 'already', 'released', 'little', 'gem', 'North', 'American', 'DVD', 'release', 'long', 'overdue']",Mortuary [VHS]

Wish they would release Blu-Ray but maybe that is for later. Love the setting of this movie in beautiful coastal California in the early 80's.

The fast, repeated cut scenes during the kills makes it clear fast that the director didn't want to reveal that there really werent any gore effects to speak of.Bill Paxton as the crazy mortician's son is great and its nice to see him hamming it up in a retro 80's slasher from the VHS era. That was a total surprise. Christopher George (Pieces/City of the Living Dead) and his wife Linda (also Pieces) are great fun as usual. Horror fans will recognize them right away.The only extra is an interview with the score composer, which was disappointing because the guy doesn't even remember making the music. He was pretty old. I guess no one else wanted to be a part of this DVD release. *shrug*Other than being a little slow in the middle, I think all fans of 80's horror/slashers will enjoy this film and it certainly belongs in the collection along side all the other crazy films from the same era.

1035615,A70LW1392FFA,B000KTCCQG,JamesA,"[1, 2]",I bought this movie a couple months ago. From reading the reviews so many people posted i knew i was in store for a roller coaster like experience. When it finally arrived i popped it into the dvd player and started watching. What i got was something rarely seen in 80's horror movies. This started out like most of them but veered off to some other territory. This one adds to the traditional stalk and slash of these movies from that decade. Not only do we have a killer in a costume we have other story lines like a cult and creepy flashbacks. Although you can easily see what's going to happen this movie takes you there in some creative ways. Another plot is the main character keeps having nightmares where she sleep walks. While she sleep walks the cloaked killer seems to stalk her and call out her name. A truly creepy part is when she is having one of these episodes you are unsure wether she actually sees this dark killer or it is part of her imagination. These scenes alone creeped me out and that is not easy to do with me. There are some truly creepy moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. After this creepy middle part we are then subjected to the tradional revelation of the killer at the end where we hear their motive. The revelation of the killer didn't surprise me and it will probably not surprise you if you have half a brain. Some funny parts i would like to mention would be the often mention of Bill Paxton's character skipping through the grave yard. And one i found very funny is the killer driving behind our main character as she makes her way home. What i found funny about this scene is that the villain is driving in full costume. I know we need to keep the identity a secret but it would seem far fetched to have someone driving in a cloak and mask. You would think you could barely see out of that if you were driving somewhere. Other than that we are treated to some beautiful landmarks of the ocean and the hills. I recommend this movie. You won't be let down with a movie like this.,4,Mortuary?
