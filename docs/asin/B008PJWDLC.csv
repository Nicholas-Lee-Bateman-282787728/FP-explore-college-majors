1574069,A2YNTGYG5J5U3J,B008PJWDLC,"ck123 ""ck123""","[0, 1]","This movie did have some cute humor to it, with the eccentric aunt who calls her nephew ""baby bird"", and also with how she brought them breakfast in bed and joined them in bed for a moment. However, the relationship issues that happen don't seem to make sense. The one who seemed to be aloof or giving the cold shoulder was opposite than what I expected. In the beginning we see the white guy who proposes by giving the black guy a cock ring as an alternative to an engagement ring, as a way of wanting commitment. So, I would have expected the white guy to be the one who acts all lovey dovey, and wanting to be close to his black boyfriend. And I would have expected the black boyfriend to be the one who perhaps is hesitant and aloof. But no, the one who proposed is the one who is acting aloof. And the black boyfriend is trying to go out of this way to fit in, by suggesting buying some new ornaments for the aunt's Christmas tree. Not what I was expecting - it just didn't add up.",2,Mildly Interesting,1364601600,"03 30, 2013",2013,986,"['movie', 'did', 'have', 'cute', 'humor', 'eccentric', 'aunt', 'who', 'nephew', 'baby', 'bird', 'also', 'how', 'brought', 'breakfast', 'bed', 'joined', 'bed', 'moment', 'However', 'relationship', 'issues', 'happen', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'make', 'sense', 'one', 'who', 'seemed', 'be', 'aloof', 'giving', 'cold', 'shoulder', 'was', 'opposite', 'what', 'expected', 'beginning', 'see', 'white', 'guy', 'who', 'giving', 'black', 'guy', 'cock', 'ring', 'alternative', 'engagement', 'ring', 'way', 'wanting', 'commitment', 'So', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'white', 'guy', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'lovey', 'dovey', 'wanting', 'be', 'close', 'black', 'boyfriend', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'black', 'boyfriend', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'perhaps', 'hesitant', 'aloof', 'one', 'who', 'proposed', 'one', 'who', 'acting', 'aloof', 'black', 'boyfriend', 'trying', 'go', 'out', 'way', 'fit', 'suggesting', 'buying', 'new', 'ornaments', 'aunt', 'Christmas', 'tree', 'Not', 'what', 'was', 'expecting', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up']",N/A
1574070,A25L1GQF65K55K,B008PJWDLC,Craig Haynes,"[5, 5]","I am always interested to see some ethnic diversity on the homo/queer screen. In this case, a black guy and a bi-racial guy, i.e., Korean/European. (BTW: We need more bi-racial stories from all communities. Increasingly, bi-racial folks will form a more obvious community, and I find their challenges interesting. However, I digress.) The lead characters are real and very believeable and there are some very funny moments and lines from most of the principals in this ensemble piece.  I have to say, I really liked the flirty ski instructor and there were a number of 'under-the-breath' jibs and jabs from many characters, which is so typical of our close encounters in families and when we're out 'n about. Witty banter and flirtatious ski instructors aside, the film explores the nature of committed relationships. Obviously, for some, marriage is the sine qua non of truly committed relationships, but for others, it is a statistically proven nadir, and relationship killer. We get to see how these two individuals work-out the details of these differing views of commitment. That this all takes place in Montana, is even more interesting and for me, such scenery makes that flirty ski instructor even more sexy. Where's the map and what mountain is he on?

Set in Montana, it could be wide open, as ""big as the sky"" (pun intended - Big Sky Country.  Get it?  That weak?  Sorry.).  Instead, it keeps to the frame of a relationship where two people love each other.  There is no tragedy, no great loss.  It is about sorting things out, quietly fighting, but never losing sight of the good things.  It includes family, but never loses sight of the core story.It is very well acted, with the leads and supporting cast; the filming, lighting, etc are high quality.  There are a couple of times where you miss lines due to sound, but it is minimal.Who knew a realistic portrayal of a relationship could be so enjoyable?  Fun and funny?
