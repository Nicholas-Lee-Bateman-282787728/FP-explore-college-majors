49128,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,078322172X,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[2, 2]","See La Jet&eacute;e to appreciate what Gilliam did here. I'd say it's probably his best film. It reminds me of Michel Foucault actually in it's dealing with insanity and history and a bald guy. And the original short film is French and then at one point in 12 Monkeys we find ourselves in the trenches of the first world war with French troops.It's a scary film, but ultimately provides a slim glimmer of hope out of the immensely melancholic backdrop of our doomed world and the post-apocalyptic one of the near future. Sort of. I found bizarre and moving the story of the lead character Cole, played by Bruce Willis. Aside from PULP FICTION, this is his best performance. His story and that of his doctor, played by Madeleine Stowe, give the movie some heart and make what ultimately unfolds hard to take. Brad Pit is excellent as a loony animal rights activist and if anyone thinks he doesn't have acting chops, they should see the pretty boy in this role.IMHO, Gilliam's best film and one with a truly scary premise, if anything because we could realistically see it happening in the real world. One single nutcase could obtain a lethal airborne virus and spread it all over the world within a couple of days just by hopping on planes. Unfortunately we don't have the ability to time travel.

49131,A3JXOXKWOIETIY,078322172X,"Adam Bernstein ""sixtiesuniverse""","[1, 2]","12 Monkeys is a top notch sci-fi scenario focused on Bruce Willis, an agent from the year 2034 who goes back in time to find a virus in its pure form before it wiped out the human race.Madeline Stowe (though too beautiful to be believable in her role as psychiatrist) gradually comes to believe Willis isn't just another lunatic.Some interesting undercurrents come through which may or may not have been Director Terry Gilliam's intention.  One is when Willis hears the radio and says, &quot;I love the music of the 20th century&quot;...actually what he's listenning to is not music from 1996 but that of the '50s and '60s.  I mean he's not listenning to rap, the Backstreet Boys, Brittany....I think the underlying message is:  what happened to good music, not simply in 2034, but in 1996?Another message which is more overt is that psychiatry is a flawed (to put it mildly) profession.  We see some pretty bad hospital conditions and some pretty uncaring doctors (except for Stowe of course).  Unfortunately, though an important and true message, it detracts from the main flow of the film.Now the time travel aspect:  Willis says there is no way to change anything cause it already happened.  Well that opens up a BIG can of contradictory worms.  First, of course his simply being there automatically changes things, not only that, but (Spoiler Alert) why does he run after the guy with the virus at the end if he knew he couldn't change anything?  And why even bother to run away...where can he hide if he knows the virus is about to wipe out humanity?I did think the scenario where HE is the boy at the airport is very effective and really ties the plot together.  He keeps dreaming of that scene he saw as a kid in the airport and then Stowe recognizes him as the boy.  Interesting time paradox there.  He sees himself...so maybe he couldn't change anything because that's what happened in 1996...he was ORIGINALLY there from the future.Anyway it's great entertainment and Brad Pitt is hilarious.",4,Gotta Love this Film,1027987200,"07 30, 2002",2002,2002,"['12', 'Monkeys', 'top', 'notch', 'sci-fi', 'scenario', 'focused', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'agent', 'year', '2034', 'who', 'back', 'time', 'find', 'virus', 'pure', 'form', 'wiped', 'out', 'human', 'race.Madeline', 'Stowe', 'too', 'beautiful', 'be', 'believable', 'role', 'psychiatrist', 'gradually', 'believe', 'Willis', ""n't"", 'just', 'lunatic.Some', 'interesting', 'undercurrents', 'come', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'Director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'intention', 'One', 'when', 'Willis', 'radio', 'quot', 'love', 'music', '20th', 'century', 'quot', 'actually', 'what', 'listenning', 'not', 'music', '1996', ""'50s"", ""'60s"", 'mean', 'not', 'listenning', 'rap', 'Backstreet', 'Boys', 'Brittany', '.I', 'think', 'underlying', 'message', 'what', 'happened', 'good', 'music', 'not', 'simply', '2034', '1996', 'message', 'more', 'overt', 'psychiatry', 'flawed', 'put', 'mildly', 'profession', 'see', 'pretty', 'bad', 'hospital', 'conditions', 'pretty', 'uncaring', 'doctors', 'Stowe', 'course', 'Unfortunately', 'important', 'true', 'message', 'main', 'flow', 'film.Now', 'time', 'travel', 'aspect', 'Willis', 'way', 'change', 'anything', 'cause', 'already', 'happened', 'Well', 'up', 'BIG', 'can', 'contradictory', 'worms', 'First', 'course', 'simply', 'being', 'automatically', 'changes', 'things', 'not', 'only', 'Spoiler', 'Alert', 'why', 'run', 'guy', 'virus', 'end', 'knew', 'could', ""n't"", 'change', 'anything', 'why', 'even', 'bother', 'run', 'away', 'where', 'can', 'hide', 'virus', 'wipe', 'out', 'humanity', 'did', 'think', 'scenario', 'where', 'HE', 'boy', 'airport', 'very', 'effective', 'really', 'plot', 'together', 'dreaming', 'scene', 'saw', 'kid', 'airport', 'then', 'Stowe', 'boy', 'Interesting', 'time', 'paradox', 'there', 'so', 'maybe', 'could', ""n't"", 'change', 'anything', 'what', 'happened', '1996', 'was', 'ORIGINALLY', 'there', 'future.Anyway', 'great', 'entertainment', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'hilarious']",N/A

""12 Monkeys"" is a perfect example of the creative talent of the director Terry Gilliam, not only he is a gifted comedian, he is also a great science fiction director. In ""12 Monkeys"" we can see big doses of black humor and social satire. The movie works as some kind of fable with a tragic ending.The 3 main members of the cast gave one of their finest performances in this movie: Bruce Willis as the enigmatic James Cole, few times he has been as good as he was in ""12 Monkeys"". Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly gave balance and subtlety to this dark story. Brad Pitt as the insane Jeffrey Goines gave a touch of black comedy to the movie with his frantic performance.The soundtrack has very, very good tracks like the beautiful ""What A Wonderful World"", performed by Louie Armstrong, the melancholic ""Sleepwalk"", performed by Santo &amp; Johnny, or the mysterious tango rhythm of the main theme in ""12 Monkeys"".

49137,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,078322172X,Andrew Ellington,"[5, 5]","As many have already noted, `12 Monkeys' is one of the best (if not the best) time travel movies ever filmed.  What makes `12 Monkeys' so extraordinary is its marvelously crafted script (inspired by Chris Marker's short film `La Jetee') coupled with some stellar performances wrapped up in director Terry Gilliam's glossy packaging.  In short, `12 Monkeys' is a complete package.  There is nothing lacking in this film.  The intensity is high, the personal connection is strong, the emotional resonance is there and the overall engrossing subject matter is at an all time high.  `12 Monkeys' is a film that grabs you and sucks you into its whirlwind of science fiction intrigue.The film opens in the year 2035.  The world as we know it is gone, substituted by a dark and barren wasteland; a world crippled by a devastating virus that wiped out most of the human population and forced the survivors to retreat to the desolate underground.  The government comes to convict James Cole with a proposition he can't refuse; a chance to have his criminal record expunged if he `volunteers' to travel back in time and obtain a sample of this virus the government can then work with to develop a cure.  This trip sends Cole on a strange journey not only physically but mentally as well, causing Cole to challenge his thoughts and views on what is truly real.`12 Monkeys' brilliantly crafts a physiological thriller that stays with the viewer and challenges the way they think as well.  It's one of those films that is mentally exhausting, but in a truly rewarding way.  It's a film that leaves the audience feeling as if they just witnessed something meaningful and worthwhile; a film that ultimately becomes so much more than just a film.Like I mentioned, `12 Monkeys' sports some brilliant performances by the entire cast; most notably though the two male leads.  Brad Pitt (who had a phenomenal year in '95) justifiably received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Jeffrey Goines; the mental patient who befriends Cole and just may have something to do with the unleashing of that diabolical virus.  Bruce Willis though is also flawless here and deserved an Oscar nomination as well in my humble opinion.  While Willis is undoubtedly comfortable when jumping out of the way of explosions and shooting wildly at terrorists, in `12 Monkeys' (as well as other films like `The Sixth Sense') Bruce proves that he has the acting chops to tackle the dramatic with the save fervor and comfort in which he tackles the high-octane action film.  His composure and complete understanding of his characters emotional makeup is outstanding here.  He dominates in the supreme definition of the word.  Also notable is Madeleine Stowe's performance as Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who Cole encounters during his travels.`12 Monkeys' is pure brilliance in my eyes, a film that defies odds and breaks boundaries in order to deliver something fresh and enthralling from start to finish.  This is a film unlike any other; one that mixes ample helpings of mystery and science, drama and fear creating a masterful concoction that will open your eyes and your mind in ways you never imagined.  This is a tragically underrated film that may very well be one of the best films ever made.  In the very least it is a science fiction staple that no fan of the genre should go without embracing.",5,Quite simply nothing short of Sci-Fi perfection...,1208995200,"04 24, 2008",2008,3368,"['many', 'have', 'already', 'noted', '12', 'Monkeys', 'one', 'best', 'not', 'best', 'time', 'travel', 'movies', 'ever', 'filmed', 'What', '12', 'Monkeys', 'so', 'extraordinary', 'marvelously', 'crafted', 'script', 'inspired', 'Chris', 'Marker', 'short', 'film', 'La', 'Jetee', 'coupled', 'stellar', 'performances', 'wrapped', 'up', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'glossy', 'packaging', 'short', '12', 'Monkeys', 'complete', 'package', 'nothing', 'lacking', 'film', 'intensity', 'high', 'personal', 'connection', 'strong', 'emotional', 'resonance', 'there', 'overall', 'engrossing', 'subject', 'matter', 'time', 'high', '12', 'Monkeys', 'film', 'grabs', 'sucks', 'whirlwind', 'science', 'fiction', 'intrigue.The', 'film', 'year', '2035', 'world', 'know', 'gone', 'substituted', 'dark', 'barren', 'wasteland', 'world', 'crippled', 'devastating', 'virus', 'wiped', 'out', 'most', 'human', 'population', 'forced', 'survivors', 'retreat', 'desolate', 'underground', 'government', 'convict', 'James', 'Cole', 'proposition', 'ca', ""n't"", 'refuse', 'chance', 'have', 'criminal', 'record', 'expunged', 'volunteers', 'travel', 'back', 'time', 'obtain', 'sample', 'virus', 'government', 'can', 'then', 'work', 'develop', 'cure', 'trip', 'Cole', 'strange', 'journey', 'not', 'only', 'physically', 'mentally', 'as', 'well', 'causing', 'Cole', 'challenge', 'thoughts', 'views', 'what', 'truly', 'real.', '12', 'Monkeys', 'brilliantly', 'physiological', 'thriller', 'viewer', 'way', 'think', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'films', 'mentally', 'exhausting', 'truly', 'rewarding', 'way', 'film', 'audience', 'feeling', 'just', 'witnessed', 'something', 'meaningful', 'worthwhile', 'film', 'ultimately', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'film.Like', 'mentioned', '12', 'Monkeys', 'sports', 'brilliant', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'most', 'notably', 'two', 'male', 'leads', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'had', 'phenomenal', 'year', ""'95"", 'justifiably', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'portrayal', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'mental', 'patient', 'who', 'Cole', 'just', 'may', 'have', 'something', 'do', 'unleashing', 'diabolical', 'virus', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'though', 'also', 'flawless', 'here', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'as', 'well', 'humble', 'opinion', 'Willis', 'undoubtedly', 'comfortable', 'when', 'jumping', 'way', 'explosions', 'shooting', 'wildly', 'terrorists', '12', 'Monkeys', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Bruce', 'acting', 'chops', 'tackle', 'dramatic', 'save', 'fervor', 'comfort', 'high-octane', 'action', 'film', 'composure', 'complete', 'understanding', 'characters', 'emotional', 'makeup', 'outstanding', 'here', 'supreme', 'definition', 'word', 'Also', 'notable', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'performance', 'Kathryn', 'Railly', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'Cole', 'travels.', '12', 'Monkeys', 'pure', 'brilliance', 'eyes', 'film', 'odds', 'breaks', 'boundaries', 'order', 'deliver', 'something', 'fresh', 'enthralling', 'start', 'finish', 'film', 'other', 'one', 'ample', 'helpings', 'mystery', 'science', 'drama', 'fear', 'creating', 'masterful', 'concoction', 'will', 'open', 'eyes', 'mind', 'ways', 'never', 'imagined', 'tragically', 'underrated', 'film', 'may', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'very', 'least', 'science', 'fiction', 'staple', 'fan', 'genre', 'should', 'go', 'embracing']",N/A

You know it's really good when you come out of the theater in *silence*, afraid to break the quiet by asking any questions at all.  I found myself still thinking about this film YEARS after seeing it.  I thought the actors did a great job, but the *ideas* in the film are what I keep coming back to.  The juxtaposition of the vibrant world of Madeline Stowe's character and Bruce Willis' character is stunning.  And going thru the experience with Willis keeps you on the edge of your seat as you hope against all odds that SOMEONE, anyone, will take him seriously.  David Morse also does a great job here.  He plays nice guys well (the father in CONTACT), but I like him more when he's a meanie.Gilliam's direction is once again solid throughout-he guides the film with an expert's touch.

49140,AK6UVFSU07NXH,078322172X,Anthony Hinde,"[3, 4]","For those of you who are familiar with Director Terry Gilliam's work in film, &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; may have been a surprise. Not because it was a  convoluted, seemingly drug induced journey through a mental maze but  because it was so straightforward. Remember Brazil, The Time Bandits,  Jabberwocky and The Adventures of Baron  Munchausen? But you surrealists  need not Despair, there are still more than enough twists and warps in the  plot to keep us guessing.I have to wonder whether the mainstream  nature of the film was responsible for its success at the box-office or  whether it was the Bruce Willis effect. I like to think it was both because  I can't imagine the film with any other actor taking the lead and yet the  story itself is terrific. Some hardened Sci-Fi junkies might think there  was little originality in the story. If you pick any film apart  sufficiently this can be shown to be true. But it's the combination of  events and devices in 12 Monkeys that makes it unique.Almost  all of the film takes place from the point of view of James Cole, (Willis),  an inmate of a crowded prison existing well into the 21st century. It's not  clear what his crime may be but we get the feeling that merely existing may  constitute a felony in Cole's world. But he is offered  an exit from his  cage by way of a volunteer program. All he has to do is go back in time, to  the 20th century, and gather evidence for a group of scientists. Mind you,  the scientists may or may not be mad; it really depends on how mad their  world is.You see, the world as we know it was struck down by the  wrath of a virus, in 1996. The pathetic remnant of humanity, that survives  into Cole's future, are still fighting the disease. Their hope is, that  finding a pure strain of the original virus, before it mutates, may help  them beat it in their present and thus regain dominance of the Earth. A  hope which is made obvious by the population's situation; living  underground in air filtered dungeons.Things go wrong from the  start, as Cole finds himself in the wrong time zone. This situation is  apparently, not unusual in the annals of  the program. He quickly runs  afoul of the police and is taken straight to the booby hatch for radical  drug therapy. It is here that he meets two other pivotal characters; his  doctor, Kathryn Railly and a fellow inmate Jeffrey Goines.With  the walls of the asylum things start to get really complicated. Cole  gradually becomes convinced that Goines, (Brad Pitt), may have released the  virus, (his father is a virologist), and that Cole himself may have started  the whole thing, during a conversation when he was semi-delirious in the  hospital. At the same time, Dr. Kathryn Railly, (Madeleine Stowe), begins  to believe Cole's strange story as the evidence mounts, and she has to  choose between trusting Cole or committing herself for psychiatric  treatmentAll of the performances are first class but I have to  single out David Morse for his small but important part, working in the  bio-hazard lab. Also Brad Pitt made the most of his role, coming across  convincingly as a manic schizoid. In the end though, it is the story that  holds us. 12 Monkeys is one of those rare films that seem to ask more  questions than are answered, without alienating the audience. And even if  you don't &quot;get it&quot;, the ride is worth the ticket price.

Drawn into the story of the movie, I couldn't help myself for being fascinated in the completion of a jigsaw puzzle, and when the end came, there was a spooky feeling, standing in a wonder if it would really happen. Brad Pitt, for his work, definitely deserved a look in this picture, being conscious of the fact this was out of his range in the characters he would normally choose. After playing a role in Pulp Fiction, Bruce Willis rose again with his serious role. Also, a well done job for Madeleine Stowe. I am surprised that she had sunk to bottom level when she did Avenging Angelo after being involved with this film and The Last of the Mohicans.

However, I think most people overlooked Willis' performance in this role. In my opinion this is one of the first films in which Bruce Willis shows just how good an actor he can be. Sure the Die Hard films had already cemented Willis as a movie star, but he pulls out all the stops here in Terry Gilliam's sci-fi genre bending flick.Willis shows us how good he is at being quiet and contemplative--something that went on to win him accolades in films like 6th SENSE. But Willis also brings this haunting sense of desperation and pain to his character which he hadn't shown in his work prior to 12 MONKEYS.As for the DVD it's got the goods when it comes to extras.

49154,A1EKTLUL24HDG8,078322172X,Bill R. Moore,"[3, 4]","12 Monkeys is an excellent film that works well in many different areas - science fiction thriller, off-beat love story, semi-noir comedy, etc. -, while superb execution in many general areas pushes it beyond these genres. It thus comes highly recommended not only for fans of these elements but for anyone alive to well-made films.It quickly becomes clear that director Terry Gilliam made the most of a small budget, not only hiring an impressive talent cadre but also overseeing an ambitious production with large sets, dazzling imagery, and hundreds of extras. His ability to make all the disparate elements coalesce is truly impressive. The sets and special effects are not as flashy as big budget films' but are very creative and extremely well-done. Gilliam's year 2035 is not the usual SF extravaganza but almost daringly bland despite a futuristic sheen; he gives a vivid idea of how society might look if forced underground and in many ways held back but with some technology and intelligence remaining. The cinematography is quite fine throughout, and some of the camera angles are particularly excellent. Paul Buckmaster's score is also up to his usual high standard and used quite effectively.Perhaps the biggest and most pleasant surprise is that the acting is very solid. I was highly skeptical of Bruce Willis taking the lead role in a film with little action, but he does a very admirable job. His role is full of subtlety, at once intimidating and vulnerable; it was certainly his greatest performance up to this point and a major breakout. Much the same can be said of Brad Pitt; though his role is small - much smaller than the advertising suggests -, it is very different from anything he had done before and quite strong. Some take issue with his performance, but this seems to be more a criticism of his character than of his acting. Madeleine Stowe is also exemplary in the lead female role; her performance is again notably nuanced, incorporating everything from academic authority to panic-stricken ambivalence to disguised bimboism. All the minor roles are also well-done.The real standout, though, is David and Janet Peoples' script, one of the freshest and most invigorating in recent memory. Inspired by a classic French art film and incorporating many other influences and elements, it welds all into a memorable and original whole. The film is on its most obvious level an SF thriller; exciting, entertaining, and engrossing, it can be appreciated in this sense alone. It certainly has the most interesting spin on the time travel paradox in some time, and its future vision is refreshingly unusual. However, the love element is also important; Willis even says he thinks the film is a love story and may well be right. The execution is far from conventional but not without a certain charm and can be strangely moving. There is also a significant comic element to the film overall; it pokes good-natured fun at some SF conventions; wields a sharp satirical blade at psychiatry, professors, extreme animal rights activists, and others; and has a curious dash of black humor that, in the ""trunk"" scene at least, even borders on slapstick. Such diversity could easily have been disastrous, but the script's commendable tightness - no doubt helped by Gilliam's strong guiding hand - prevent this. Many films, especially SF thrillers, try to puzzle audiences with plot twists and other tricks only to have it all come together in a devastating ending, but very few succeed so well. The story is told concisely but in a way that keeps us guessing; as in stories by SF great Philip K. Dick, we never quite know what is real and what is not, giving a disarming but pleasing disorientation that draws us in quickly and keeps us interested. The writers deserve special praise for not dumbing-down the story to normally Hollywood standards; this is an intelligent script demanding attention and concentration and that truly rewards repeat viewings. There is also much to provoke thought about a variety of important issues:  the definition of sanity, the ethics of science, the rights of animals, authority vs. individualism, etc. Finally, we should be thankful that the Peoples did not take the easy way out with the ending; though ultimately triumphant, it is shot through with tragedy and strongly moving.The associated documentary is noteworthy enough to attract those who have already seen the film - perhaps even those who already own a prior version. It is easily the best ""Making of"" I have ever seen. An hour and a half long, it covers every production aspect from initial brainstorming to post-production. Many facets not usually seen - editing, marketing, test screening, etc. - are here in detail. Most fascinating of all is that it has a true behind the scenes feel that is rarely achieved; the principals are unusually open about filming's ups and downs, and their reactions to outside views and pressures are surprisingly candid. The documentary is also a well-made film in itself, entertaining and often funny. It is essential for 12 fans.All told, anyone looking for a well put together SF film with other attributes - some action, a surprising number of laughs, and even a little romance, plus much to provoke thought - would be hard-pressed to do better than 12.",4,Excellent in All Respects,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,5302,"['12', 'Monkeys', 'excellent', 'film', 'well', 'many', 'different', 'areas',

Unfortunately, he sent back to wrong time and finds himself in a mental institution.

49168,A2PBV1899CX3TE,078322172X,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[0, 4]","Director Terry Gilliam got his start doing animated shorts for the British comedy program Monty Python and then directing their feature films. An early non-Python project, Brazil, nevertheless contained Python cast members. No pythons were harmed during the making of Twelve Monkeys, but the same can't be said of the audience members. Look at Twelve Monkeys as a cinematic experiment that ultimately failed, but valuable information was gleaned from the experience, mostly about what not to do.First, if you are going to have a post apocalyptic scenario where all but a small percentage of humans are killed and the ones who survive live like worms underground, don't factor in time travel as a plot device, because it is just not believable that such a society could achieve time travel, given their obvious setbacks. Next, don't cast Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt (more about them later), and third, have a less ambiguous ending, where they either save the world, or not, but don't leave the whole thing unresolved, where you have to question what was the point, if any, of this novel cinematic experience.I can vouch for Gilliam. Brazil was quite inventive and creative, and The Fisher King was fantastic. Great performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges in The Fisher King, but more important than any individual performance, the movie worked as a whole. Would that the same could be said of Twelve Monkeys.----------------------James Cole: I'm here about some monkeys.Jeffrey Goines: Monkeys?James Cole: Monkeys. Yes. Twelve of them.===========================James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner with a violent past who is 'volunteered' to go back to the past to find out how the deadly epidemic started, and how was the virus spread. He gives his usual smug action hero performance with just a touch of self mockery, to fool you into thinking that he doesn't take himself too serious. But he does take himself way too serious, and so all the smug mugging and ironic winks are for naught. ""All I see are dead people,"" he says at one point. Whatcha talkin' 'bout, Willis? Is this meant to mock his role in The Sixth Sense? If so, then that is a pretty clever little joke -- but not clever enough to save this film.-------------------------James Cole: I'm looking for the Army of the Twelve Monkeys.===================================James (Bruce Willis) Cole ends up in a mental institution where he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt). On the way in, we see a television monitor where some of the patients are watching Tex Avery cartoons. This is way too heavy handed symbolism to show that Brad Pitt is going to be acting like a cartoon. Just like Johnny Depp based a character on Pepe La Peu crossed with Keith Richards, it seems that Pitt has a similar design in mind for Jeffrey Goines. Was he trying to simultaneously play both Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd? There were moments of brilliance, but overall it just didn't work. Brad just dug himself deeper and deeper into a Pitt.-----------L.J. Washington: I don't really come from outer space.Jeffrey Goines: Oh. L. J. Washington. He doesn't really come from outer space.L.J. Washington: Don't mock me my friend. It's a condition of mental divergence. I find myself on the planet Ogo, part of an intellectual elite, preparing to subjugate the barbarian hordes on Pluto. But even though this is a totally convincing reality for me in every way, nevertheless Ogo is actually a construct of my psyche. I am mentally divergent, in that I am escaping certain unnamed realities that plague my life here. When I stop going there, I will be well. Are you also divergent, friend?==================That was a tremendous scene but the character of L.J. Washington is just a throw away. It would have been a much better movie if it had followed L.J. Washington's divergences instead of Pitt's and Willis' amateur attempts at acting. BTW, L.J., love those bunny slippers.Madeleine Stowe, who was also great in Playing by Heart, put in a strong performance as head shrinker Kathryn Railly, but she was unable to prevent the catastrophe

It seems to not get much more than a cult following at this moment, but as time passes there's no doubt in my mind that this will become a classic science fiction psychological thriller of the first order.  Bruce Willis is unbelievable in this movie.  Brad Pitt is very good, too.  The acting is superb.But, what I cannot stress enough is the absolute necessity of understanding what this film is really intended to do: *spoiler below**It's intended to express as best as possible what paranoid delusions are actually really like for mental illness patients.  Trust me on that.Ok, spoiler over, and that's not really much of one as it is.  But, if you want to get into a little schizophrenia for yourself this is your movie.  It's not for all audiences, though.  Those who have genuine mental illness probably should not watch the movie at all.  Maybe.  On the other hand, maybe it could help them to understand better their own confusions.Whatever.The bottom line is that this is a fantastically well developed thriller with science fiction elements.  It's totally psychological, and completely and utterly confusing in every way.  In the end you are left wondering what you've just witnessed and what has just happened.  You really don't know, but you think you do, but you don't.

One of those films ended up being Terry Gilliam's Brazil. While visually cool, story-wise it was kind of boring and I didn't really care about the characters which is of course a big no-no. Same with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas which I watched sober, so maybe that was the big difference. Nearly every weed smoking/beer drinking friend I have in town praises the film. So we come to 12 Monkeys which I liked and it's so far one of my favorites he's done.It's the year 2035 and 5 billion people died thanks to a virus unleashed by the Army of the 12 Monkeys, a group of people who infected the world in 1996 and 1997. Cole, an inmate ""volunteers"" to travel to 1996 to obtain a pure sample since it's long since mutated with hopes of engineering a cure. However they sent him to 1990 and even worse, his rant and ravings about future viruses and mankind's near extinction gets him thrown in the nuthouse. What erupts from there is quite enthralling and will sure keep your brain on their toes...so to speak.One thing I always love about these kind of films is how certain things in the future get explained such as literal writings on the wall to phone messages and it gets involving mentally, maybe a bit too much so. While I didn't get confused, some scenes will probably just fly over people's heads and leave them disoriented. Especially its ending which I won't spoil and while I did figure it out what it was, other parts I'm like ""hey wait a minute, what about...?""Bruce Willis, as well as maybe Mark Wahlberg and Orlando Bloom, as what I call the ""William Hurt"" factor: no matter how good their performance(or bad in the case of Bloom and occasional Wahlberg), they always sound so BORED. However, this film is arguably one of Bruce's best. Surprisingly it's also one of Brad Pitt's, playing Jeffrey Goines, a man who, as the box puts it mildly, has a few cards short of a full deck. Then there's Madeleine Stowe who I always liked in films she's in but I rarely see her. While there's other actors in the film, such as David Morse and Christopher Plummer, it's primarily these 3 that get center attention.While I wouldn't necessarily buy 12 Monkeys unless someone bought it for me, it's certainly quite an enjoyable film in its own right.",5,"For me, it's arguably Gilliam's best film",1159142400,"09 25, 2006",2006,2378,"['always', 'find', 'fascinating', 'when', 'see', 'people', 'praising', 'classic', 'films', 'yet', 'when', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'point', 'was', 'One', 'films', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'visually', 'cool', 'story-wise', 'was', 'kind', 'boring', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'characters', 'course', 'big', 'no-no', 'Same', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'watched', 'sober', 'so', 'maybe', 'was', 'big', 'difference', 'Nearly', 'weed', 'smoking/beer', 'drinking', 'friend', 'have', 'town', 'film', 'come', '12', 'Monkeys', 'liked', 'so', 'far', 'one', 'favorites', 'done.It', 'year', '2035', '5', 'billion', 'people', 'died', 'thanks', 'virus', 'unleashed', 'Army', '12', 'Monkeys', 'group', 'people', 'who', 'infected', 'world', '1996', '1997', 'Cole', 'inmate', 'volunteers', 'travel', '1996', 'obtain', 'pure', 'sample', 'long', 'mutated', 'hopes', 'engineering', 'cure', 'However', 'sent', '1990', 'even', 'worse', 'rant', 'ravings', 'future', 'viruses', 'mankind', 'near', 'extinction', 'thrown', 'nuthouse', 'What', 'quite', 'enthralling', 'will', 'sure', 'keep', 'brain', 'toes', 'so', 'speak.One', 'thing', 'always', 'love', 'kind', 'films', 'how', 'certain', 'things', 'future', 'get', 'explained', 'such', 'literal', 'writings', 'wall', 'phone', 'messages', 'involving', 'mentally', 'maybe', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'so', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'confused', 'scenes', 'will', 'probably', 'just', 'fly', 'people', 'heads', 'leave', 'disoriented', 'Especially', 'ending', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'did', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'other', 'parts', ""'m"", 'hey', 'wait', 'minute', 'what', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'as', 'well', 'maybe', 'Mark', 'Wahlberg', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'what', 'call', 'William', 'Hurt', 'factor', 'matter', 'how', 'good', 'performance', 'bad', 'case', 'Bloom', 'occasional', 'Wahlberg', 'always', 'sound', 'so', 'BORED', 'However', 'film', 'arguably', 'one', 'Bruce', 'best', 'Surprisingly', 'also', 'one', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'playing', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'man', 'who', 'box', 'mildly', 'few', 'cards', 'short', 'full', 'deck', 'Then', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'who', 'always', 'liked', 'films', 'rarely', 'see', 'other', 'actors', 'film', 'such', 'David', 'Morse', 'Christopher', 'Plummer', 'primarily', '3', 'get', 'center', 'attention.While', 'would', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'buy', '12', 'Monkeys', 'someone', 'bought', 'certainly', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'film', 'own', 'right']",N/A

Also, a caveat to anyone who has seen Marker's film, for this film will, unfortunately, seem far less adventurous artistically than it really is. But it works both as a time travel fable and the depiction of an insane mind because event though, in the film's diegetic reality, Cole seems to be a genuine time traveler, he is almost assuredly a madman, as well. As is Dr. Railly, who violates one of the cardinal rules of her profession, becoming emotionally and sexually involved with her patient. It is also one of the rare films that benefited from later historical events; in this case, obviously 9/11, for both Cole and Peters provide excellent depictions of the differing halves of the criminal/terrorist mindsets of believing in their own realities and the rectitude of their actions, despite the violence incurred. Thus, while 12 Monkeys is not a film in a league with other sci fi films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, nor is it as daring as Gilliam's own earlier Brazil, it is a film of quality.

49177,A1T3O2LILVK0C4,078322172X,"Count Orlok '22 "":(""","[3, 4]","From his days withMonty Pythonto his visionary epic Brazil, Terry Gilliam has never been an ordinary filmmaker. His unique sense of style and his trademark absurdist humor can be found in all of his films. In 1995, he cemented his reputation as one of the most unconventional directors in America with his brilliant science fiction film, 12 Monkeys. 12 Monkeys is an apocalyptic, romantic, time travel adventure inspired by the French film,La Jet&eacute;e, which was written by Chris Marker. However, Gilliam's film is entirely his own, a stunning masterpiece of contemporary cinema, and one of the most cleverly bizarre films ever made. The screenplay was written by David and Janet Peoples, who inject the story with an intimate humanistic quality, juxtaposing romance with an eerie atmosphere of impending disaster.In the year 2035, James Cole (Bruce Willis) is a prisoner in a subterranean stronghold where the last survivors of a cataclysmic virus are held up. Their world is monitored by a panel of scientists who use the prisoners for mysterious experiments. Cole is selected to go up onto the Earth's desolate surface and collect life forms for the scientists to study. Upon his return to the underground prison, Cole is told that he's a candidate for an experiment, which if it were successful he would be given a full pardon. He is sent back in time to discover the source of the virus, but he arrives in the wrong year. After getting into a fight with police officers, Cole is sent to a rundown insane asylum where he befriends a psychiatrist named Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe). He also meets a host of mentally dysfunctional patients, including a paranoid schizophrenic named Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt) who spends most of his time watching cartoons, harassing other patients, and ranting about government conspiracies. Jeffrey helps Cole in an escape attempt, which ends with Cole being caught by the mental hospital's guards and being put into an isolation room, heavily restrained. He mysteriously disappears from the hospital and arrives back in the future. There, the scientists tell him that despite his failure he has been exceptionally useful. They ask him if he would be willing to go back and further investigate the 12 Monkeys... and Jeffrey Goines who may be involved with their formation. However Cole is sent, not only to the wrong time but the wrong place. He lands in Southern France, in the middle of WWI. He's shot in the leg before he vanishes into time.Meanwhile, Kathryn Railly has been giving lectures on abnormal psychology and the theoretical ""Cassandra complex"", which states that some people suffer a mental disorder that makes them believe that they are clairvoyant, and knowledgeable of future catastrophes. After one of her lectures, she's ambushed by a strange man who wants her to drive him to Philadelphia. It's Cole and he's traced the origin of the virus to Jeffrey Goines and his billionaire virologist father. Kathryn convinces Cole that he's delusional, but then Cole's story is proven to be true when she discovers that the bullet she removed from his leg dates back to the first quarter of the 20th century. Now she must uncover the truth and help Cole to stop the spread of the virus, but nothing is what it appears to be.The entire cast is superb. Bruce Willis delivers one of his most nuanced performances as Cole, creating a strong yet vulnerable man who must overcome his own fears of madness in order to save humanity. Madeleine Stowe gives a fascinating performance of a sane woman, who must call into question all of her long held beliefs, and face the insanity of the world around her. But the most memorable character is Jeffrey Goines, who is brought to by Brad Pitt in one of his most remarkable performances ever. He succeeds in making Goines sympathetic, funny, and completely manic. Not only does show off his underutilized versatility as an actor, Brad Pitt also gives us, the audience, access to the off kilter world in which the entire film unfolds. As for Gilliam's direction, 12 Monkeys proves that he's capable of making films that are not only humorous, but stark and profound as well. Ironically, the film's greatest flaw is also its greatest strength. As an audience, we are never explicitly told how the story ends. Sure, there are implications within the film, but there are so many different interpretations that one single idea feels constricting and limiting. Terry Gilliam's brilliance is that he doesn't dictate his story to the viewers; rather he allows them to discover its subtleties and secrets on their own, and then draw their own conclusions. It makes the film even more interesting to watch with a group of friends and everyone's perception of the ending is contrary. It's this idea of open interpretation that makes 12 Monkeys so timeless.Also recommended:Monty Python's Flying Circus: Terry Gilliam's Personal BestMonty Python and the Holy GrailJabberwockyTime

49178,A26BWRBPP4V2WF,078322172X,Craig MACKINNON,"[7, 8]","As with most Terry Gilliam films, this one is dense, somewhat complex, and often confusing.  The upshot is that it never cheats - everything that happens is in character and within the logic of the world Gilliam has created.  Unfortunately, the density causes the first viewing to be overwhelming, but adds to its replayability.  It is a film enjoyed more the second and third time than the first.The story: an engineered virus is released in the 90's that eventually wipes out most of the human race.  The remnants flee underground to a system of caves and sewers to escape the virus.  Due to the rapid mutation of the virus, no cure or vaccine can be developed without a sample of the original virus from the 90's.  Therefore, they must send someone back in time to obtain the sample; that person is Cole, played by Bruce Willis.  Naturally, he is mistaken for a mental patient and locked up where he meets Dr. Reilly (Madeline Stowe) and fellow inmate Goines (Brad Pitt), whose father happens to be a molecular biologist specialising in viruses.This sets up the hunt for the perpetrators of the virus release, thought to go by the name of &quot;the Army of the 12 Monkeys.&quot;  Is it Goines and his animal-rights friends?  Is it his father, the virus expert?  Or is it actually Cole himself in some sort of time-paradox?  We are left guessing until the end, and if you haven't been paying attention, it might seem that the story has cheated, but in fact it hasn't.  You can't guess the solution (there isn't enough information), but it is logical.There are a number of great touches, one of which I'll mention here.  Cole has nightmares about a shooting that he witnessed as a child.  The people in the dream occasionally change faces, however, based on who Cole is suspicious of at the time.

49182,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,078322172X,Dennis Littrell,"[24, 37]","It only takes twelve monkeys, strategically placed throughout the world, to kill five billion people with a mutant virus.  (Actually glass canisters are used.)The central character, James Cole, played with heavyweight  restraint by Bruce Willis, is a convict from the future where the survivors  live underground, leaving the surface to the animals.  He and other  nonconformists live in cages and are made to ""volunteer"" to go back in time  to search for the original virus before it mutated in 1996.  Problem is  they keep getting the destination year screwed up.  Once they send him to  1917 and land him naked in the middle of a battle from World War I, where  he gets shot in the leg.  Another time they send him to 1990 where he ends  up in a mental institution and meets attractive co-star Madeleine Stowe,  who plays psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly, leading to an interesting  subplot: shrink falls in love with her mentally disturbed patient.  Brad  Pitt entertains as Jeffrey Goines, a hyperactive nut case, son of a sick  virologist, and leader of an animal rights activist group.  He is  crazy/wise.The film is heavily populated by unfeeling, semi-competent  scientists, mental patients and their caretakers.  There are all sorts of  apocalyptic fools ranting and raving about the end of the world, etc.  Most  of human society as we know it is in shadow, off camera.  There's an  understandable terror of psychoactive drugs among the patients.  Thorazine  in particular is mentioned.  Cole's body is continually being assaulted by  hypodermics, electrodes, the fists and boots of the guards and other hard  objects.  His face is continually smeared with blood.  One gets the idea  that director Terry Gilliam had a bad dream and wanted to  share.Regardless, this brooding, atmospheric yarn is the best cinematic  sci-fi I have seen since Blade Runner (1982); and it is no co-incidence  that it was scripted in part by the gifted David Peoples who helped write  the screen play for Blade Runner.  Never mind that time travel to the past  is an absurdity.  We're forced to rise above that because Gilliam presents  time similar to the way Kurt Vonnegut did in his novel Slaughterhouse-Five  (1969), namely that all time is happening ""simultaneously"" and especially  right now, forever.  Notice that when James Cole dies Dr. Railly is not sad  because Cole lives on in the person of his younger self, the child at the  airport watching his death.  This will be the case for eternity.In  typical Gilliam style there are a number of funny bits in the script.  After Cole beats up the pimp to save Dr. Railly, and forces a trade of  teeth (to evade the trackers implanted in his teeth), and the cops come,  the pimp says, all hurt, ""I was attacked by a coked-up whore and a crazy  dentist.""  Another nice touch is to have the virologist father of crazy  visionary Jeffrey Goines sound like a southern politician instead of your  usual mad scientist.  I also liked it when psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly  said, ""Psychiatry is the latest religion...I'm in trouble.  I'm losing my  faith.""  She's right: psychiatry and clinical psychology in general is a  secular religion less than two hundred years old that we as a society ought  to regard with suspicion.In short this is not your usual Bruce Willis  outing.  The action/adventure stuff is secondary to story and character  development and to the social and political statements of the film, the  more important of which is to protest the suppression of the individual by  the larger society.  The forces of evil really are those who dictate what  is normal and those who enforce conformity.  This film is commercially  successful because many of us feel the constraints of society and can  readily identify with Cole's struggle.  What is worse, Thorazine and Prozac  or marijuana and beer?  Anyone who identified even in the slightest with  this film can answer that question.  The second statement is that humans are ruining the planet  and should be killed to save the animals.  This melancholy idea is not so  far-fetched.  That some cult of nuts (or visionaries, as you like) might  someday infect humanity with a deadly virus so that the flora and fauna of  the planet might resume their natural state is at least plausible.",5,Visually and intellectually complex,960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,4288,"['only', 'twelve', 'monkeys', 'strategically', 'placed', 'world', 'kill', 'five', 'billion', 'people', 'mutant', 'virus', 'Actually', 'glass', 'canisters', 'are', 'used', 'central', 'character', 'James', 'Cole', 'played', 'heavyweight', 'restraint', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'convict', 'future', 'where', 'survivors', 'live', 'underground', 'leaving', 'surface', 'animals', 'other', 'nonconformists', 'live', 'cages', 'are', 'made', 'volunteer', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'search', 'original', 'virus', 'mutated', '1996', 'Problem', 'keep', 'getting', 'destination', 'year', 'screwed', 'up', 'send', '1917', 'land', 'naked', 'middle', 'battle', 'World', 'War', 'where', 'shot', 'leg', 'time', 'send', '1990', 'where', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'meets', 'attractive', 'co-star', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'who', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Kathryn', 'Railly', 'leading', 'interesting', 'subplot', 'shrink', 'love', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'patient', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'hyperactive', 'nut', 'case', 'son', 'sick', 'virologist', 'leader', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'group', 'crazy/wise.The', 'film', 'heavily', 'populated', 'unfeeling', 'semi-competent', 'scientists', 'mental', 'patients', 'caretakers', 'are', 'sorts', 'apocalyptic', 'fools', 'ranting', 'raving', 'end', 'world', 'etc', 'Most', 'human', 'society', 'know', 'shadow', 'off', 'camera', 'understandable', 'terror', 'psychoactive', 'drugs', 'patients', 'Thorazine', 'particular', 'mentioned', 'Cole', 'body', 'continually', 'being', 'assaulted', 'hypodermics', 'electrodes', 'fists', 'boots', 'guards', 'other', 'hard', 'objects', 'face', 'continually', 'smeared', 'blood', 'One', 'idea', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'had', 'bad', 'dream', 'wanted', 'share.Regardless', 'brooding', 'atmospheric', 'yarn', 'best', 'cinematic', 'sci-fi', 'have', 'seen', 'Blade', 'Runner', '1982', 'co-incidence', 'was', 'scripted', 'part', 'gifted', 'David', 'Peoples', 'who', 'helped', 'write', 'screen', 'play', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Never', 'time', 'travel', 'past', 'absurdity', ""'re"", 'forced', 'rise', 'Gilliam', 'presents', 'time', 'similar', 'way', 'Kurt', 'Vonnegut', 'did', 'novel', 'Slaughterhouse-Five', '1969', 'namely', 'time', 'happening', 'simultaneously', 'especially', 'right', 'now', 'forever', 'Notice', 'when', 'James', 'Cole', 'Dr.', 'Railly', 'not', 'sad', 'Cole', 'person', 'younger', 'self', 'child', 'airport', 'watching', 'death', 'will', 'be', 'case', 'eternity.In', 'typical', 'Gilliam', 'style', 'are', 'number', 'funny', 'bits', 'script', 'Cole', 'beats', 'up', 'pimp', 'save', 'Dr.', 'Railly', 'trade', 'teeth', 'evade', 'trackers', 'implanted', 'teeth', 'cops', 'come', 'pimp', 'hurt', 'was', 'attacked', 'coked-up', 'whore', 'crazy', 'dentist', 'nice', 'touch', 'have', 'virologist', 'father', 'crazy', 'visionary', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'sound', 'southern', 'politician', 'instead', 'usual', 'mad', 'scientist', 'also', 'liked', 'when', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Kathryn', 'Railly', 'said', 'Psychiatry', 'latest', 'religion', ""'m"", 'trouble', ""'m"", 'losing', 'faith', 'right', 'psychiatry', 'clinical', 'psychology', 'general', 'secular', 'religion', 'less', 'two', 'hundred', 'years', 'old', 'society', 'ought', 'regard', 'suspicion.In', 'short', 'not', 'usual', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'outing', 'action/adventure', 'stuff', 'secondary', 'story', 'character', 'development', 'social', 'political', 'statements', 'film', 'more', 'important', 'protest', 'suppression', 'individual', 'larger', 'society', 'forces', 'evil', 'really', 'are', 'who', 'dictate', 'what', 'normal', 'who', 'enforce', 'conformity', 'film', 'commercially', 'successful', 'many', 'feel', 'constraints', 'society', 'can', 'readily', 'identify', 'Cole', 'struggle', 'What', 'worse', 'Thorazine', 'Prozac', 'marijuana', 'beer', 'Anyone', 'who', 'identified', 'even', 'slightest', 'film', 'can', 'answer', 'question', 'second', 'statement', 'humans', 'are', 'ruining', 'planet', 'should', 'be', 'killed', 'save', 'animals', 'melancholy', 'idea', 'not', 'so', 'far-fetched', 'cult', 'nuts', 'visionaries', 'like', 'might', 'someday', 'infect', 'humanity', 'deadly', 'virus', 'flora', 'fauna', 'planet', 'might', 'resume', 'natural', 'state', 'least', 'plausible']",N/A

Gilliam also coaxes great acting from his two male stars. Bruce Willis is so cool as the hero of the piece, despite being beaten and bruised for much of the story.

The story is told from the point of view of person whose perception of reality is faulty. Crazy for want of a better word. This is well handled  and adds plot twists which enhance the entertaining aspects of the film.  The crux of the story is that the world has experienced a disease fatal to  humans which has driven society underground. John Cole is selected to go  out on the surface to collect samples for analysis and determine whether  the atmosphere is safe. He emerges out into a an abandoned city where  amongst other things he sees a sign with twelve monkeys painted on it. He  thinks little of it at the time and returns underground. There he is  debriefed and given a new task to travel back in time and stop the release  of the epidemic into the atmosphere. Nobody believes hes from the future  and anyway he is a demented mental state with violent tendencies. A  psychiatrist, Dr. Railly, played by the elegant Madelaine Stowe, who comes  to interview him, sees him as useful to her studies and she takes an  interest in his case. If you like a bit of irony in a story this film has  lots of it. As improbably as love blossoms between Railly and Cole so the  story of the twelve monkeys criss-crosses past, present and future.

If, on the other hand, you are inclined to view ambitious projects that test your imagination, then this film should be on your wish list.The film is basically a Grecian tragedy that is transposed into the medium of the science fiction genre.  It centers around the concepts of fate and pre-determination, using the instruments of sci-fi lore instead of the seers and prophecies of Greek mythology.  The allusion to Cassandra  (daughter of Priam &amp; Hecuba [king &amp; queen of Troy], condemned by Apollo for betraying her promises to him) is not only appropriate, but utterly delicious.  This is a film for classical scholars and aficionados of mythology if there ever was one.The production also features an all-star cast.  Bruce Willis is superb in what is quite an out-of-the-ordinary role for him.  Madeline Stowe, as always, is top-knotch.  Brad Pitt is wonderful as a crazy man, delivering perhaps the finest performance of his career.

49197,A1C3HJ00AVPQ87,078322172X,E. Nickel,"[0, 0]","That's a strong statement to make but I think this superb movie backs up the claim with an intelligent script, a deft directorial touch by Terry Gilliam and first rate performances by the leads. Other reviews have suggested this is the best movie about time travel and that may be true but this surprisingly heartfelt film is much more multi-faceted than simply a tale about how events in the past affect the future and vice-versa. One of the surprising things about this film, not necessarily noticed in its first viewing, is how spare the dialogue is, lending a somber quiet to parts of the film. Credit Gilliam for that choice but also Bruce Willis especially for a nuanced performance that lays bare his soul. I've always liked Willis as an actor but this may be his greatest role and he rises to the occasion. It takes acting chops to play someone as simple as Cole and Willis pulls it off. He anchors the sometimes wild plot twists, his pain making us believe this is really happening to him. Even as we view the horrible post apocalyptic future and knowing in the past how this is likely to come about, it is Cole's pain and longing that we feel most deeply. In fact, my one main quibble with the film was Gilliam's choice to add surreal, comical elements to the story. These bits are at total odds to the mood of the film, seeming to have been imported from some other film entirely. That said, the humor and craziness shown by Brad Pitt's character does work, as it's grounded in his character's mental instability. Pitt was already a rising star at this point and after Legends of the Fall, a heartthrob. It was a risk taking on the Goins character and Pitt gives a spellbinding performance, showing the restless intelligence beneath Goins disturbed mind. Pitt makes us believe that he does know something important, that in some way the story revolves around him. The rest of the cast acquit themselves admirably but it is Willis, Pitt and Madelaine Stowe that hold our interest. Gilliam sinks his hooks into the viewer by having Cole's mission, and his time in the past, confounded by mistakes, be that the inaccuracies of his time travel, by unforeseen events in the past, even by the choices Willis makes in coming to terms with the freedoms suddenly offered to him in this new world. To the viewer, the events that unfold are a twisting, sometimes confusing mess but that's exactly Gilliam's point. Ironically, it is Gilliam's decision to keep the characters' straightforward humanity front and center within the swirling storylines that makes 12 Monkeys such an absorbing film. It's this human element that elevates 12 Monkeys to the very top of mainstream Sci-Fi movies. You never stop feeling Cole's pain and his longing to be free, even as you gradually come to understand what terrible consequences that longing will have. This was Gilliam's greatest film and one of the most thoughtful Science Fiction films ever made. That's exactly why it holds up to repeated viewings and why it's one of the few movies that I chose to own.",5,Best Mainstream Sci-Fi film ever?,1384387200,"11 14, 2013",2013,3047,"['strong', 'statement', 'make', 'think', 'superb', 'movie', 'up', 'claim', 'intelligent', 'script', 'deft', 'directorial', 'touch', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'first', 'rate', 'performances', 'leads', 'Other', 'reviews', 'have', 'suggested', 'best', 'movie', 'time', 'travel', 'may', 'be', 'true', 'surprisingly', 'heartfelt', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'multi-faceted', 'simply', 'tale', 'how', 'events', 'past', 'affect', 'future', 'vice-versa', 'One', 'surprising', 'things', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'noticed', 'first', 'viewing', 'how', 'spare', 'dialogue', 'lending', 'somber', 'quiet', 'parts', 'film', 'Credit', 'Gilliam', 'choice', 'also', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'especially', 'nuanced', 'performance', 'bare', 'soul', ""'ve"", 'always', 'liked', 'Willis', 'actor', 'may', 'be', 'greatest', 'role', 'occasion', 'acting', 'chops', 'play', 'someone', 'as', 'simple', 'Cole', 'Willis', 'off', 'sometimes', 'wild', 'plot', 'twists', 'pain', 'making', 'believe', 'really', 'happening', 'Even', 'view', 'horrible', 'post', 'apocalyptic', 'future', 'knowing', 'past', 'how', 'likely', 'come', 'Cole', 'pain', 'longing', 'feel', 'most', 'deeply', 'fact', 'one', 'main', 'quibble', 'film', 'was', 'Gilliam', 'choice', 'add', 'surreal', 'comical', 'elements', 'story', 'bits', 'are', 'total', 'odds', 'mood', 'film', 'seeming', 'have', 'been', 'imported', 'other', 'film', 'entirely', 'said', 'humor', 'craziness', 'shown', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'character', 'work', 'grounded', 'character', 'mental', 'instability', 'Pitt', 'was', 'already', 'rising', 'star', 'point', 'Legends', 'Fall', 'heartthrob', 'was', 'risk', 'taking', 'Goins', 'character', 'Pitt', 'spellbinding', 'performance', 'showing', 'restless', 'intelligence', 'beneath', 'Goins', 'disturbed', 'mind', 'Pitt', 'believe', 'know', 'something', 'important', 'way', 'story', 'rest', 'cast', 'acquit', 'admirably', 'Willis', 'Pitt', 'Madelaine', 'Stowe', 'hold', 'interest', 'Gilliam', 'hooks', 'viewer', 'having', 'Cole', 'mission', 'time', 'past', 'confounded', 'mistakes', 'be', 'inaccuracies', 'time', 'travel', 'unforeseen', 'events', 'past', 'even', 'choices', 'Willis', 'coming', 'terms', 'freedoms', 'suddenly', 'offered', 'new', 'world', 'viewer', 'events', 'unfold', 'are', 'twisting', 'sometimes', 'confusing', 'mess', 'exactly', 'Gilliam', 'point', 'Ironically', 'Gilliam', 'decision', 'keep', 'characters', 'straightforward', 'humanity', 'front', 'center', 'swirling', 'storylines', '12', 'Monkeys', 'absorbing', 'film', 'human', 'element', '12', 'Monkeys', 'very', 'top', 'mainstream', 'Sci-Fi', 'movies', 'never', 'stop', 'feeling', 'Cole', 'pain', 'longing', 'be', 'free', 'even', 'gradually', 'come', 'understand', 'what', 'terrible', 'consequences', 'longing', 'will', 'have', 'was', 'Gilliam', 'greatest', 'film', 'one', 'most', 'thoughtful', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'films', 'ever', 'made', 'exactly', 'why', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'why', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'chose', 'own']",N/A

In &quot;12 Monkeys&quot; we're told we can't change what's already happened. This is a really clever film by Terry Gilliam about time travel  and the danger it presents if we interfere with history.In the 21st  century, only  one per cent of the human race remains.  They live in  shelters underground. A deadly virus is in the atmosphere, making the  surface of the planet uninhabitable to humans. The animals roam free, amid  the crumbling ruins of our cities.Beneath the city of Philadelphia, a  group of scientists send James Cole (Bruce Willis) on a reconnaiscence.  When he is on the surface he finds a red logo of monkeys circling a big  &quot;12&quot;. Beneath the logo is the caption: &quot;We did it!&quot;James is then sent back in time to find the source of the virus. He  links the virus to the Army of the 12 Monkeys, a fanatical group of animal  rights activists. Once he can track them down, a scientist from the future  can come back to our time, study the virus, go back to the future and make  a cure. But things dont go according to plan...This film examines the  danger of messing around with time. We can unwittingly be responsible for  things that we try to prevent. Actions always count. &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;  has an allegorical flavour. The scientists in the future have found the  secret of time travel but they still haven't beaten the virus. In our time  we can send people into space but we still haven't found a cure for AIDS or  the common cold.You have to pay more attention to this film than you  would with your normal action film. Much of the film is cryptic and  ambiguous.If you like this film I recommend you read the John Wyndham  short story &quot;Consider Her Ways&quot;. It was written in 1956 and  involves a virus that killed all the men. When the main character tries to  stop this from happening, she unwittingly causes the very thing she was  trying to prevent.

It's one of the few films I really liked in the 1990's, as it is (as with most of Gilliam's work) a true work of art and something that is totally Gilliamish.  It is a sad, haunting, strange work.  One of the reasons this film works so well is that the studio left Gilliam alone and let him get on with it.  The performances by Bruce Willis, Madeline Stowe, and Brad Pitt are all excellent.  Willis is exceptionally good, showing that he can actually act if working with a great director like Gilliam.  Stowe brings a tender, quiet quality to her role, and Pitt is great as a borderline insane guy.  Some of his dialogue is a bit obvious, but overall it doesn't detract too much from the film.  This is a pseudo-remake of Chris Marker's remarkable La Jetee, but Gilliams does it justice.  La Jetee is a masterpiece, but then, so is this film.  Gilliam really does ""reimagine"" it, bringing his own distinct voice to the material, and expounding on Marker's masterpiece.  Marker recently said he felt this film was wonderful because Gilliam has such a rich imagination (which he does).  The ending is quite sad, but it works very well, and kudos to the studio and Gilliam for keeping it in.  I always admired Gilliam's film, even his misunderstood Tideland.

But so much of his work suffers from too much creativity (Brazil, Baron Munchausen, etc.) that his brilliant vision often turns into clutter and noise. He needs a steadier hand to guide him at times, and we've found it with David People's marvelous screenplay.12 Monkeys is Gilliam's most disciplined, moving and thought-provoking film precisely because we are able to relate to its ideas surrounding insanity, paranoia and doomsday.Bruce Willis is a convict in a dystopian future where nearly all of mankind has been killed off by a super-virus unleashed in 1996. The survivors live underground like rats and the animals (immune to the virus) are the only creatures on the surface. He is recruited to go back in time to retrieve a sample virus so that the scientist plutocrats who rule his society can develop a vaccine.OK, typical plot developments occur, right? ""Bruce, back in the 1990s, is considered a crack-pot and a looney and he's locked up. He's got to get out and complete his mission and there's one person who can help: Dr. Kathryn Reilly, psychiatrist and do-gooder.""But wait, there's more. So much more, including Brad Pitt (in my favorite performance as the maniac who may be behind the virus); complex time travel that effectively distorts YOUR idea of what's real; man's corruption of the earth; and a vision of humanity's collective madness that only Gilliam could capture.Because at the center is Bruce Willis as James Cole. A violent person hardened by life, but who can also listen to a song on the radio with the relish of a child. Madeleine Stowe is at her most luminous as Dr. Reilly, and the love that develops between them is neither unecessary or contrived.

The lead character (played by Willis) leads you on a journey that eventually questions even your own sanity as it twists and turns. How can he be from  the future? Is time travel impossible? Is he insane?You are kept  guessing even to the end, and are then shocked to discover the terrible  truth about his nightmares as a child...I for one would recommend this  film purely on the journey it leads you on, backed by the nightmarish  landscapes and the eventual feeling of claustrophobia. Who would have  thought that the future could be so bleak? Yet...Time travel is always a  difficult subject in films. If you are to believe the subject, it brings  the film all the more closely into your imagination. And to actually see  that time travel, even if it is real, cannot change time (which is very  confusing in itself) is an amazing yet horrific trip.The only comment is  that although the final scene 'I'm in insurance' gives you hope, it does  feel slightly tacked on by Hollywood, and you hope that despite this, the  future is still assured (no matter how it turns out) - mainly because it  disagrees with the entirely plausible script up to that point.I hope  I've not given too much away if you don't know the film.

However, when he arrives in the year 1990, he is believed to be mad and is placed in a mental institution, under the care of psychiatrist Madeleine Stowe. Stowe also believes that Willis is suffering from mental illness, with paranoid delusions of the end of the world, but then Willis mysteriously escapes from the solitary confinement cell he has been placed in following an attempt to escape the mental institution. Six years later, in 1996, Willis appears again and tracks Stowe down, taking her hostage and forcing her to drive across country to Philadelphia, because he needs her help to stop what he refers to as the `army of the twelve monkeys'. Stowe believes that she has been kidnapped by a dangerous schizophrenic and does not believe his claims, that he is from a future in which most of the world's population has been wiped out by a deadly virus and that he has come to try and stop this virus. But when strange things start happening that verify that Willis is indeed a time traveller, Stowe is forced to put her professional scepticism to one side and accept that Willis is not insane but has been speaking the truth the whole time. Now Stowe tracks Willis down, and is anxious to help him try to stop the virus and the end of the world. But now Willis has become the unbeliever, and has started to doubt his own sanity and wonder whether his memories of time travel and a dystopian future are real or rather the invention of a deranged mind. Ironically, Willis' psychiatrist now has to convince him that he is sane after all, and the stakes could not be higher, because if he does not start to believe this, all will be lost. This film was a quite flawless work of science-fiction imagination, relying on story rather than special effects to make its mark. Bruce Willis is excellent as our bemused hero who doesn't know whether he is sane or crazy and Madeleine Stowe is also faultless as the psychiatrist who at first believes that Willis is mentally ill but slowly becomes a believer. Brad Pitt is also notable as an eccentric animal rights activist that Willis first meets in the mental institution. This film has few if any special effects, even in the scenes set in the future and it is a testament to Willis's acting ability that I found myself empathising with the pain of Willis' character as he joyfully experienced the things that we take for granted - clean air, music, being able to live above ground - in contrast to the horrors of his own time. This film was an exemplar piece of story-telling; with its message about appreciating the world that we have even with its imperfections, a wonderful red herring and an excellent twist near the end of the film that elevated what would have been just an excellent film into an outstanding one.

49223,A3UDYY6L2NH3JS,078322172X,"Jacques COULARDEAU ""A soul doctor, so to say""","[2, 6]","This is a remake of the French film  La Jet&eacute;e , and yet it is completely different. The film kept the time-travelling dimension, the catastrophe that killed five billions  human beings and forced the survivors to live underground in some kind of medically managed prison for everyone. The time-traveller is a volunteer in this prison who is trying to reduce his time by volunteering to the surface to pick insects and samples of life out there, and also to the past to find out what happened in 1996, and eventually prevent the catastrophe. But that is about all, except for the boy at the airport and the man killed there with the same twitch in the punchline as in  La Jet&eacute;e . But the film develops three other dimensions. The first one is the reaction of the world of the past when confronted to this time-traveller from their future. They just put him away in some asylum where he meets the woman of his dream as one of the doctors there. This reaction reveals the strange blindness of humanity because they consider anyone who is in anyway different, divergent as one says, as being insane. In this world you have to conform to the little box where fate, in fact social determination, has put you. You can be normal, or you can be a deranged preacher, or you can be a whore or pimp, or you can be a homeless bum, or you can be a criminal, but beyond there you are insane. That makes society absolutely blind to anything that is slightly off the line because they refuse to see it. This is perfectly examplified with this army of the 12 monkeys, a clandestine criminal organization that has stolen some dangerous bacterial germ and is going to spread it in half a dozen cities in the world. The film also develops the relation between the time-traveller and the lady of his dream. It is a real relation. Medical at first, then it is an abduction, then it becomes some kind of love or cooperation. The lady then is no longer dead like in the French model. She sure is alive and she ends up believing him about what was or is supposed to happen on December 13th. But they fail or rather fate, history, destiny succeed. He dies and she runs after him and the criminal with his bacteriological samples can escape. The world is doomed. This is the third development of the French model. You cannot change history. This already was in H.G. Wells's  The Time Machine . But this time it is central in the film. At the same time he plays on two embodiments of the same character in the same scene but duplicated by one who is time-travelling. This is an essential element of the trilogy  Back to the Future . But you cannot change history that follows its own rules and cannot be tampered with. What is to happen has to happen. Total fatality. Strangely enough it does not have the same meaning as in H.G. Wells. No sentimentality about it. Just the brutal realization that humanity has vainly thought and believed they could make history. This new idea was common in H.G. Wells's time. Today it has become some oddity from our marxist positivistic past, some oddity that very few people believe in any more. History is going its own way along its own rails with its own reasons and any human being in this history has to follow the flow. They can swim or they can let themselves be carried by the current, or they can sink in a way or another. But they will not stop the stream nor change its course. A river has never been able to go up the hills : it has to follow rules that have little to do with us, such as gravity and slope.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",5,"No one can escape from their history, their destiny",1170028800,"01 29, 2007",2007,3634,"['remake', 'French', 'film', 'La', 'Jet', 'eacute', 'yet', 'completely', 'different', 'film', 'kept', 'time-travelling', 'dimension', 'catastrophe', 'killed', 'five', 'billions', 'human', 'beings', 'forced', 'survivors', 'live', 'underground', 'kind', 'medically', 'managed', 'prison', 'everyone', 'time-traveller', 'volunteer', 'prison', 'who', 'trying', 'reduce', 'time', 'volunteering', 'surface', 'pick', 'insects', 'samples', 'life', 'there', 'also', 'past', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', '1996', 'eventually', 'prevent', 'catastrophe', 'boy', 'airport', 'man', 'killed', 'same', 'twitch', 'punchline', 'La', 'Jet', 'eacute', 'e', 'film', 'three', 'other', 'dimensions', 'first', 'one', 'reaction', 'world', 'past', 'when', 'confronted', 'time-traveller', 'future', 'just', 'put', 'away', 'asylum', 'where', 'woman', 'dream', 'one', 'doctors', 'there', 'reaction', 'strange', 'blindness', 'humanity', 'consider', 'anyone', 'who', 'anyway', 'different', 'divergent', 'one', 'being', 'insane', 'world', 'have', 'conform', 'little', 'box', 'where', 'fate', 'fact', 'social', 'determination', 'put', 'can', 'be', 'normal', 'can', 'be', 'deranged', 'preacher', 'can', 'be', 'whore', 'pimp', 'can', 'be', 'homeless', 'bum', 'can', 'be', 'criminal', 'are', 'insane', 'society', 'absolutely', 'anything', 'slightly', 'line', 'refuse', 'see', 'perfectly', 'examplified', 'army', '12', 'monkeys', 'clandestine', 'criminal', 'organization', 'stolen', 'dangerous', 'bacterial', 'germ', 'going', 'spread', 'dozen', 'cities', 'world', 'film', 'also', 'relation', 'time-traveller', 'lady', 'dream', 'real', 'relation', 'Medical', 'first', 'then', 'abduction', 'then', 'kind', 'love', 'cooperation', 'lady', 'then', 'no', 'longer', 'dead', 'French', 'model', 'sure', 'alive', 'up', 'believing', 'what', 'was', 'supposed', 'happen', 'December', '13th', 'fail', 'rather', 'fate', 'history', 'destiny', 'succeed', 'criminal', 'bacteriological', 'samples', 'can', 'escape', 'world', 'doomed', 'third', 'development', 'French', 'model', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'history', 'already', 'was', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'Time', 'Machine', 'time', 'central', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'two', 'embodiments', 'same', 'character', 'same', 'scene', 'duplicated', 'one', 'who', 'time-travelling', 'essential', 'element', 'trilogy', 'Back', 'Future', 'can', 'not', 'change', 'history', 'own', 'rules', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tampered', 'What', 'happen', 'happen', 'Total', 'fatality', 'Strangely', 'not', 'have', 'same', 'meaning', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'sentimentality', 'Just', 'brutal', 'realization', 'humanity', 'vainly', 'thought', 'believed', 'could', 'make', 'history', 'new', 'idea', 'was', 'common', 'H.G', 'Wells', 'time', 'Today', 'become', 'oddity', 'marxist', 'positivistic', 'past', 'oddity', 'very', 'few', 'people', 'believe', 'more', 'History', 'going', 'own', 'way', 'own', 'rails', 'own', 'reasons', 'human', 'being', 'history', 'follow', 'flow', 'can', 'swim', 'can', 'let', 'be', 'carried', 'current', 'can', 'sink', 'way', 'will', 'not', 'stop', 'stream', 'change', 'course', 'river', 'never', 'been', 'able', 'go', 'up', 'hills', 'follow', 'rules', 'have', 'little', 'do', 'such', 'gravity', 'slope.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU', 'University', 'Paris', 'Dauphine', 'University', 'Paris', '1', 'Pantheon', 'Sorbonne']",N/A

Superb performances by Bruce Willis and Madeleine Stowe, and a riveting turn by Best Supporting Oscar nominee Brad Pitt whose face, hands, and voice seem to be performing three distinct choreographies simultaneously.  Highly stylized set decorations and lavish art direction are enhanced by some truly astonishing special effects shots (gotta love the ""animals on the loose"" scenes which are alternately menacing and beautiful). The plot twists and turns back on itself like a pretzel, and then pays off during the last ten minutes of the film with a series of stunning surprises and revelations.The Collector's Edition DVD is truly something special.  In addition to a flawless film-to-video transfer, it includes a satisfying handful of extra features, including cast and crew biographies, the Original Theatrical Trailer, production notes, and more.  Best of all is ""The Hamster Factor"", a short film about the making of ""12 Monkeys"", which documents the creative challenges, pressures, and processes of modern day filmmaking in a gritty and realistic light, with no egos spared.  This DVD is definitely one to buy, not rent.  The film becomes richer and clearer every time it's seen, and it's one of those complex, multi-layered movies that is best appreciated after multiple viewings.

Although it's not especially clear on the DVD case itself, excellent  use is made of the DVD version with an extensive added documentary on the  making of the film and a running commentary by director Terry Gilliam and  producer Chuck Roven. Commentary by Gilliam is, as always, almost better  than taking a full film course: you learn not only about the making of the  film itself but of his battles with the Hollywood system which led to the  bastardized studio recut of 'Brazil' and Gilliam's insistence that he got  final cut on '12 Monkeys.' (Let's see you do *that* on a VHS version!)  Amazing to learn that a special effects sequence of time travel cost $5 to  film, but they actually spent huge amounts of money filling each outdoor  scene with fake snow to match the first day of filming...the only day it  snowed! If I have one quibble at *all*, it's a minor one: the subtitling  gives away a plot point by identifying the character speaking on an  audiotape, a character I don't think Gilliam intended us (or Willis's  character) to identify until much later in the film. But that's a minor  quibble. If you must see one of the most brilliant films of the past ten  years (and in my view, Willis's best after the original 'Die Hard' and  'Pulp Fiction'), you *must* get the DVD version.

I always liked 12 Monkeys, in part because it's Gilliam and his weird hi-lo tech / grimy futurescapes are always interesting and also because I think Bruce Willis gives one of his better performances.  30 years from now scientists underground send Bruce back to hopefully weed out the reasons and logistics of how a virus decimated 5 billion people in 1996.  Bruce, landing naked six years too early in 1990, is predictably carted off to the loony bin.  While incarcerated, he meets Madeleine Stowe as his shrink and Brad Pitt giving a marvelously manic performance complete with wandering eye, as a fellow inmate who happens to be the son of a famous virologist.  Plagued by nightmares which would ostensibly seem to deal with the initial outbreak of the disease, Willis soldiers on through capture, de-brief in the future, and re-insertion to the past.  Many of the images of the film are dark, dank, bleak, absurd and humourous on one level, but there are some moments of sheer hope and joy that seem touching they're so out of place, like when Bruce weeps with pleasure hearing torch songs of the fifties/sixties.  The relationship between Willis and Stowe is very interesting and tender, they alternate protecting and revealing vulnerabilities to each other.  Like all time travel films, there are some paradoxes as well, especially with Willis at the end.  This film can't be easily categorized or pigeonholed, it is an experience unto itself when viewed.

The story is great -- and in its logical tightness, it's right up there with the first _Terminator_ film (and the classic Heinlein stories 'By His Bootstraps' and _The Door into Summer_).The casting is amazingly good for 1995. Remember, this was before Bruce Willis was known as anything but a wisecracking action hero, and Brad Pitt hadn't yet turned into a national obsession (he'd already been cast in this one before _Interview with the Vampire_ and _Seven_ were released). In fact, when I first watched this film, I thought Pitt had been horribly miscast -- but it turned out I was wrong, as repeated viewings demonstrated. (Madeleine Stowe is terrific as well but that was no surprise then or now.)You probably already know the premise. James Cole (Willis) is a convict in 2035, and in exchange for a complete pardon he 'volunteers' for a time-travel mission. In 1996, see, most of the human race was wiped out by a really nasty virus, and the scientists of Cole's day want him to go back in time and help collect some samples of it in its unmutated form so they can get cracking on a cure. But something goes wrong . . .That's all I'll say, except to note that everything gets neatly wrapped up at the end. (And I mean everything. If you think there are loose ends, watch it again.)The screenplay is the work of David and Janet Peoples, so it's no surprise that it's well done; David Peoples was one of the writers on _Blade Runner_ (and he also wrote _Soldier_, which is set in the same world as _Blade Runner_). The dialogue is crisp and the exposition clear and swift. (In fact, it's arguably _too_ good: the film is supposed to be, in the beginning at least, ambiguous as to whether the time travel stuff is just Cole's schizoid fantasy, but thanks in large measure to the convincing screenplay, most of us know from the start that it's the real thing.)Of course it's Gilliam who brings all this together.

49241,A1TI1JMH87OP1A,078322172X,Kedar Joshi,"[5, 25]","This film is essentially based on the absurd idea of time, the idea that time is real, a dimension, which could be travelled through. The NSTP (Non - Spatial Thinking Process) theory, a major part of superultramodern science, suggests that time, like space, is not real, but is rather a mere form of illusion to non-spatial mind. Present is an experience whose physical/material bases are non-spatial feelings. Past, like space and time, is a mere feeling; not any concrete reality existing on its own. To be precise, past is a feeling I have that I felt/had it before. I can't even be sure that something happened in the past. Maybe it's just my feeling in the present, where present is also a feeling. Getting into the past therefore means having the right ideas (that would also exist as non-spatial feelings) that conceptually correspond to the past.

Starring box office favorites such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe also sets this film apart as a film that was destined to succeed.  Bruce Willis's performance is nothing short of phenomenal as we see him in a role where he's still the hero of the film, but a much more contemplative, melodramatic one.  Even when the plot calls for action, he goes about it quite differently than we'd seen him in films prior to and after this great film.  I'm not normally a big fan of Brad Pitt, but his performance in this film shows what a talented actor he is, with a great range of skills to draw from.  Madeline Stowe, as beautiful and talented as ever performs admirably as a psychiatrist drawn to Willis's character.  For me, one of the most interesting aspects of this great film is the time travel.  I've always found films that feature this to be most intriguing, if done as well as it has been done with this film.  Taken as a whole, this film stands out as a science fiction classic that bears multiple viewings easily.The premise:We meet Bruce Willis's character James Cole who is a prisoner living underground with the rest of humanity, some thirty odd years beyond 1996.  They believe that late in 1996 the army of the twelve monkeys released a viral agent in several cities resulting in the near extinction of the human race.  James Cole is tapped to ""voluntarily"" be sent back to 1996 and discover who is behind the army of the twelve monkeys and hopefully obtain a sample of this viral agent so that they might be able to find a cure for it and hopefully bring humanity back from the brink and above ground.Given that science can sometimes not be exact, they drop James into 1990 where he finds himself being thrown into a mental ward where he meets Brad Pitt's wacky character and psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who takes him under her wing.  What follows from this point is certainly to be considered another fine addition to the genres list of classics.  {ssintrepid}Special Features:The Hamster Factor and other tales of 12 Monkeys (The making of 12 Monkeys) - This is quite and intriguing hour and a half long look at director Terry Gilliam and what it took for them to put this outstanding film on the silver screen.Feature Commentary with director Terry Gilliam and producer Charles Roven.Production notes - An interesting text version that pretty much sums up what was revealed in the ""The Hamster Factor.""Cast &amp; Filmmakers - A great text synopsis of the cast &amp; filmmakers.Theatrical Trailer",5,12 Monkeys - A surreal Sci-Fi experience!,1051401600,"04 27, 2003",2003,2616,"['12', 'Monkeys', 'small', 'measure', 'term', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'science', 'fiction', 'tale', 'Starring', 'box', 'office', 'favorites', 'such', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'also', 'film', 'apart', 'film', 'was', 'destined', 'succeed', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'performance', 'nothing', 'short', 'phenomenal', 'see', 'role', 'where', 'still', 'hero', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'contemplative', 'melodramatic', 'one', 'Even', 'when', 'plot', 'action', 'quite', 'differently', ""'d"", 'seen', 'films', 'prior', 'great', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'normally', 'big', 'fan', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'performance', 'film', 'what', 'talented', 'actor', 'great', 'range', 'skills', 'draw', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'ever', 'admirably', 'psychiatrist', 'drawn', 'Willis', 'character', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'aspects', 'great', 'film', 'time', 'travel', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'films', 'feature', 'be', 'most', 'intriguing', 'done', 'as', 'well', 'been', 'done', 'film', 'Taken', 'whole', 'film', 'out', 'science', 'fiction', 'multiple', 'viewings', 'easily.The', 'premise', 'meet', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'character', 'James', 'Cole', 'who', 'prisoner', 'living', 'underground', 'rest', 'humanity', 'thirty', 'odd', 'years', '1996', 'believe', 'late', '1996', 'army', 'twelve', 'monkeys', 'released', 'viral', 'agent', 'several', 'cities', 'resulting', 'near', 'extinction', 'human', 'race', 'James', 'Cole', 'tapped', 'voluntarily', 'be', 'sent', 'back', '1996', 'discover', 'who', 'army', 'twelve', 'monkeys', 'hopefully', 'obtain', 'sample', 'viral', 'agent', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'find', 'cure', 'hopefully', 'bring', 'humanity', 'back', 'brink', 'above', 'ground.Given', 'science', 'can', 'sometimes', 'not', 'be', 'exact', 'drop', 'James', '1990', 'where', 'being', 'thrown', 'mental', 'ward', 'where', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'wacky', 'character', 'psychiatrist', 'Dr.', 'Kathryn', 'Railly', 'who', 'wing', 'What', 'point', 'certainly', 'be', 'considered', 'fine', 'addition', 'genres', 'list', 'classics', 'ssintrepid', 'Special', 'Features', 'Hamster', 'Factor', 'other', 'tales', '12', 'Monkeys', 'making', '12', 'Monkeys', 'quite', 'intriguing', 'hour', 'half', 'long', 'look', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'what', 'took', 'put', 'outstanding', 'film', 'silver', 'screen.Feature', 'Commentary', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'producer', 'Charles', 'Roven.Production', 'interesting', 'text', 'version', 'pretty', 'much', 'sums', 'up', 'what', 'was', 'revealed', 'Hamster', 'Factor', 'Cast', 'amp', 'Filmmakers', 'great', 'text', 'synopsis', 'cast', 'amp', 'filmmakers.Theatrical', 'Trailer']",N/A

Like others, I was astonished by Brad Pitt's acting ability, which I had previously dismissed. Some reviewers asserted, however, that Pitt's performance was overdone. The interesting aspect to this accusation is that the film is highly stylized, and all of the other supporting actors are deliberately cartoonish - over-the-top by design. So are the supporting roles. If you single out Pitt for such criticism, you unwittingly reveal that you are close to believing him... even as he is playing a necessarily outrageous character that serves as antidote to an otherwise bleak dystopia.In college, I had a paranoid schizophrenic friend, and visited him a few times when he was institutionalized with others like him. Pitt must have studied these people. Not only does he have the right delusional intonations, he has the right quirky medicated movements too. He isn't just histrionically mad; he's _really_ mad. Overdone? I beg to differ! He's spot on.A number of reviewers have mentioned that the film should be viewed several times.

Apocalyptic and dark, yet visionary, the film is trademark Gilliam, with dreary, depressing sets. It is sci-fi with a time travel twist.The year is 2035, and the future of mankind seems grim and forbidding, as the human race is relegated to living underground, never seeing the light of day, after a killer virus has decimated its ranks. James Cole (Bruce Willis), a designated criminal, volunteers to travel into the past to obtain a sample of the virus that became a killing machine, in hopes of helping scientists discover a cure, as well as getting a pardon for his supposed crimes.Cole has little information with which to work. All he knows is that in 1996 he is to search for a radical group called, ""The Army of the Twelve Monkeys"". In some way, that group is affiliated with the deadly virus. How, why, or where are questions for which he must find the answers. Like searching for a needle in a haystack, Cole tries to piece the answers together, while trying to separate fantasy from reality. He finds it increasingly difficult to do so, as time travel begins to take a toll on him, given its erratic peculiarities.In his travels, he comes across the seriously disturbed Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who seems to have something to do with that for which Cole is looking. Jeffrey also happens to be the son of a scientist, Dr. Leland Goines (Christopher Plummer). Cole, mistaken for being mentally ill when he reveals his mission, comes under the care of psychiatrist, Dr. Kathryn Reilly (Madeleine Stowe). All of these individuals are, in some way, intertwined with his mission, but not in the way he may have originally thought. How much the past is a part of the future, and how much the future is a part of the past, is a question that the viewer must divine.Bruce Willis gives an excellent performance, taut and well nuanced. Madeleine Stowe is compelling as the initially doubting doctor, who later becomes a believer of Cole's apocalyptic message. The always urbane Christopher Plummer is also excellent as the scientific genius and father to the troubled Jeffrey. It is Brad Pitt, however, who steals the show as the mentally unbalanced Jeffrey Goines, giving a virtuoso performance that won him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.This film was a difficult one for me to rate, being torn between awarding it three or four stars. I finally ended up awarding it three stars. While I liked the film, I found it to be too dark and depressing for my tastes.

The likelihood of such a phenomenon is presently great indeed (SARS, Bird Flu etc), and hopefully the film will get many people thinking.Apart from the ""back from future"" element, the movie is very realistic in its approach, and conveys a much needed message of the dangers facing the world, especially when dealing with viruses (i.e. how fast and easily many of them can spread).  Moreover, one realizes how helpless governments would be in stopping or preventing such a disaster if a virus fell into the wrong hands.Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt, and Medeleine Stowe, whose performances are simply AMAZING, make this movie one of the best of its kind.The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing a film that can be watched over and over again.Resident Evil (Milla Jovovich) is another very good movie dealing with virus-related incidents/threats, though it falls much more under ""Horror"" than Twelve Monkeys, which is a more ""Thriller/Action/Sci-Fi"" type of film.

49254,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,078322172X,"Maine Writer ""David""","[0, 2]","Some folks don't appreciate Terry Gilliam, and for good reason.  His dark vision can be troubling, in the same way that a lot of King Crimson's music can seem jarring, dissonant, and uncomfortable.  In part, it's because Gilliam's sensibilities are certainly outside of the mainstream.  He doesn't follow the typical chord progressions of mainstream film, even when his work is studio-funded.  He has an epic sense of the ideal, but also a dark, bitter sense of mankind.  It's as if Gilliam wishes that we could be redeemed, but knows it's all a sad fantasy.Twelve Monkeys is, on its surface, a fascinating time travel story.  A violent, perhaps pathological, man from the future is repeatedly propelled into the past to collect information.  It seems the past is immutable, but it can still be studied.  (Indeed, in the final moments of the film, the futility of changing anything becomes clear--or does it?)Bruce Willis, in a performance that shattered my instinctive dislike for him, struggles with a task that is extraordinarily difficult.  He both wants to save mankind, but also to lose himself in a better place.  The past, which isn't even his own past in one major respect, is like the prisoner's dream of heaven.  And Willis' character is, indeed, a prisoner.  He comes from a future where mankind has been all but wiped out by a bio-engineered virus, and the last vestiges of humanity are forced to live underground for fear that they, too, will be infected an die.Like all of Gilliam's films, there is symbolism aplenty, as well as a rather neat tie in to apocalyptic visions throughout history--as if people from thousands of years ago somehow knew the future, as if it has already been written, and that even the Book of Revelations fortells the plague of 1996.

I re-watched this movie last night for the first time in years and it gave me chills it was so beautiful.  Not as a science-fiction film so much.  For me the movie is probably the most effective, most highly wrought and strangest love story ever told.  For me the real core of the movie is the love betwen Kathryn Railly and James Cole.  It begins subtly, with Railly as the authority figure psychiatrist saying to the drugged and drooling violent mental patient James Cole ""Haven't I seen you someplace?""In the beginning, Cole's story that he has come from the future is seen as a paranoid schizophrenic delusion.  His reality is treated lightly and derided by the complacently-in-control but somehow basically like-able and fetching Railly (Madeline Stowe, in a stunning and classic screen performance)Gradually, Cole's reality becomes compelling for Railly.  She begins losing her grip on her own, smugly-complacent reality picture.  At the very same time, Cole begins to reject his own grim reality, because he is falling in love with Railly and now wants to believe that his story of having come from a grim future is a fantasy.  This plot structure is so beautifully worked out it is mindblowingly beautiful.  A prime example of how story-telling is an evolving art form.  The stories of yesteryear were rarely this complex and affecting.  You always had to stifle a yawn while watching Romeo and Juliette.  But these star-crossed lovers are such an unwittingly beautiful odd-couple it brought continuous chills of art appreciation.  As Railly glues an absurd fake mustache to Cole's upper lip - to go with his wig and loud red Hawaiian shirt - she whispers ""I remember you this way"" and though they share an exquisitely tender moment - in the lobby of an all-night movie theater playing Hitchcock films - they do not kiss.  Just thinking about it makes me start to get broken up.  It is only in the final scene in the airport that they exchange one, brief, almost embarrassed kiss, rigged out in their wigs and cruisewear, become the absurd and yet extremely dramatic versions of themselves that have haunted Cole's dreams for as long as he can remember.  This is great writing.  It is an example of how most of the truly great storytelling today is happening in movies, not in books.  Books are awash in mediocrity and pretentiousness.  The publishing industry festers to its core and has been overrun by people with such degenerate taste that it can be truly said that bad is the new good.  However sometimes in movies you get true high art.  I cannot conceive of a better, more touching love story than that between Kathryn Railly and James Cole.  Thank you Mr. And Mrs. Peoples.

49263,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,078322172X,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[1, 3]","I initially didn't want to watch this film, I'd heard things from other people, who'd found it quite difficult to follow, and yes, that did put me off. But after some persuasion (and the fact I always make my Dad watch my movies, and I rarely watch his), I decided to give it a go.I did find that I really got into watching Twelve Monkeys, including working out stuff that my Dad hadn't worked out when he first saw it. (The first shot of the young boys eyes was so obviously Cole's character younger - but I worked it out cos it's a hideous clich&eacute;, that's always used.) I also noticed that the passage from The Book Of The Revelation is quoted twice, referring to seven golden vials filled with God's wrath. Kathryn says it in her lecture, and then the homeless guy also repeats it.The story starts off in the future - the viewer is never given a set year, although it's mentioned that 1% of the population survived by the year 2035. So possibly, the viewers are left to make up their own minds that it could possibly be sometime after this. An unknown, lethal virus has wiped out five billion people in 1996. The survivors now live underground, and a convict called James Cole (Bruce Willis) reluctantly volunteers to be sent back tin time to 1996 to gather information about the source of the epidemic so scientists can study it. Mistakenly, Cole is sent back to 1990, where he is promptly locked up in a mental institution, and he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who is also in the mental institution. He needs to find a group of people, calling themselves The Twelve Monkeys, who could possibly be releasing the virus in different cities. He also recurring dreams, which feature intermittantly throughout the movie, showing the viewer a bit more each time. What's really happening?I found it incredibly difficult to watch Brad Pitt in this movie. His acting is incredible, but I just couldn't handle watching him. Apparently, to get him to act the way he did, he inititally sent him to a speech coach, and then took away his cigarettes. Very strange. And what was with the eyes? I didn't really notice them (I was focusing on something else), until it was pointed out, and then they gave me shivers up my spine. Yes, his acting is brilliant, the way he managed to do, but I really struggled with watching him, and a couple of times, had to look away from the screen.The 'romance' between James & Kathryn didn't ring true for me. It happens all of a sudden - considering she hated him to begin with - and just seems totally unbelievable.The different things that are explored in the movie, really got my brain buzzing, and I found it difficult to switch off after watching it - but I was still thinking about Brad's character too. Time travel is heavily the focus of the movie, and it's paradoxes - James kept seeing things in the future and the past, and I couldn't work out whether he was projecting these images or what. It also touches upon the subject of mental illness, reality, animal rights, and the technological advances which could bring about the end of the world.There's always different things to watch out for during the movie, and I never found myself bored at any point, despite the running time of two hours. I did end up working out the ending, but thankfully not too soon.

But it is the magnificant performances of the three main cast members that make me say absolutely see this movie. When I watched Bruce Willis and Brad Pitt create their characters, Willis the sane man who everyone (eventually even himself) believes is crazy, and Pitt the insane man who everyone (including himself) believes is a genius, my thought while I watched the story unfold was &quot;what brilliant acting!&quot; But later, when the movie ended and the dust settled in my mind, I realized that the performance of Madeleine Stowe far eclipsed even those of the other great actors. Her performance was so incredibly real as the psychiatrist who was trying to put together the pieces of the time paradox puzzle - first terrified of Willis and trying to convince him that he was crazy and needed help, and then trying harder to convince him that he was not crazy and they all needed HIS help - her performance was so real that during the movie, I never even considered the possibility that she was acting!

There's something humorous and mischievously entertaining about &quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; that keeps it from taking itself too seriously and falling prey to pretention, but then it comes back at you just as intense and creepy as a movie can get. It keeps itself fresh and fluid, with a healthy dose of quirk to it. But I don't think it knows it's an apocalyptic vision.The film is about James Cole, played by Bruce Willis, a man from the future who goes back in time to stop the disaster that sent him underground from ever happening. But that's the simple way of describing it. The story is in a constant fight as to where to go with the plot, with probably a dozen sub-ideas that could turn into something. It's twisted and elaborate and almost impossible to explain to someone without them saying &quot;what?&quot;, but like &quot;Memento&quot; or &quot;The Matrix&quot;, when you watch it, it makes sense. But these plot developements are delicious fodder and keep it moving, allowing characters like Brad Pitt's pitch perfect sort-of-insane &quot;Jeffrey Bowen&quot; to take a bow (deserved that Oscar nod, BTW).The film's eccentricity takes hold of it. From the cinematography, to the accordian theme that playfully plays throughout the film, to the excessive production design that you know was made that way just because they felt like it (though it does help make the film what it is). And more often than not, the miserable conditions of Mr. Willis or whoever else may be feeling miserable at the time come across the screen in an almost tangible way.But behind the running cinematic joke, and the dark atmosphere of the film, it drives itself home where it must, and Bruce Willis, surprisingly, performs in what is probably one of his best roles. There's a frusterating and pitiful scene when he is desperately trying to make psychiatrists in 1990 accept the fact that he's from the future. They don't buy it, and he realizes that on top of his original task, he now has to find some tedious way to make these people believe him. Teamed with the talented Madeleine Stowe, the duo help create a touching relationship that grounds the film, as it turns out, on a deep personal level.The film doesn't necessarily scare you into thinking all this would happen in real life, we've heard it too much before, and I don't think that was the goal of the movie. But by the end of the film you've been given a healthy sense of dread for the poor characters in the film. How often does that happen? Though when they play the Louis Armstrong classic &quot;Wonderful World&quot; during the credits, it stamps and seals the irony of it all, and does exactly what Mr. Armstrong probably didn't intend the song to do in the first place.",5,Monkeying around with time and viruses and crazy Brad Pitts,1031356800,"09 7, 2002",2002,2832,"['Terry', 'Gilliam', 'quot', 'vision', 'quot', 'pretty', 'nightmarish', 'funny', 'Terry', 'Gilliamish', 'way', 'something', 'humorous', 'mischievously', 'entertaining', 'quot', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'quot', 'taking', 'too', 'seriously', 'falling', 'prey', 'pretention', 'then', 'back', 'just', 'intense', 'creepy', 'movie', 'can', 'get', 'fresh', 'fluid', 'healthy', 'dose', 'quirk', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'apocalyptic', 'vision.The', 'film', 'James', 'Cole', 'played', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'man', 'future', 'who', 'back', 'time', 'stop', 'disaster', 'sent', 'underground', 'ever', 'happening', 'simple', 'way', 'describing', 'story', 'constant', 'fight', 'where', 'go', 'plot', 'probably', 'dozen', 'sub-ideas', 'could', 'turn', 'something', 'twisted', 'elaborate', 'almost', 'impossible', 'explain', 'someone', 'saying', 'quot', 'what', 'quot', 'quot', 'Memento', 'quot', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'when', 'watch', 'sense', 'plot', 'developements', 'are', 'delicious', 'fodder', 'keep', 'moving', 'allowing', 'characters', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'pitch', 'perfect', 'sort-of-insane', 'quot', 'Jeffrey', 'Bowen', 'quot', 'take', 'bow', 'deserved', 'Oscar', 'nod', 'BTW', '.The', 'film', 'eccentricity', 'hold', 'cinematography', 'accordian', 'theme', 'playfully', 'film', 'excessive', 'production', 'design', 'know', 'was', 'made', 'way', 'just', 'felt', 'help', 'make', 'film', 'what', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'miserable', 'conditions', 'Mr.', 'Willis', 'whoever', 'else', 'may', 'be', 'feeling', 'miserable', 'time', 'come', 'screen', 'almost', 'tangible', 'way.But', 'running', 'cinematic', 'joke', 'dark', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'home', 'where', 'must', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'surprisingly', 'performs', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'roles', 'frusterating', 'pitiful', 'scene', 'when', 'desperately', 'trying', 'make', 'psychiatrists', '1990', 'fact', 'future', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy', 'top', 'original', 'task', 'now', 'find', 'tedious', 'way', 'make', 'people', 'believe', 'Teamed', 'talented', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'duo', 'help', 'create', 'touching', 'relationship', 'film', 'out', 'deep', 'personal', 'level.The', 'film', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'scare', 'thinking', 'would', 'happen', 'real', 'life', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'too', 'much', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'goal', 'movie', 'end', 'film', ""'ve"", 'been', 'given', 'healthy', 'sense', 'dread', 'poor', 'characters', 'film', 'How', 'often', 'happen', 'when', 'play', 'Louis', 'Armstrong', 'classic', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'World', 'quot', 'credits', 'irony', 'exactly', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Armstrong', 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'intend', 'song', 'do', 'first', 'place']",N/A

Time travel movies are often hard to construct, and Gilliam tries novel approaches to the theme.  I found myself getting confused at various times, not sure of what Willis' role was in stopping the virus, and just who the people were that were manipulating him.

This opus from auteur Terry Gilliam is more earnest and convincing than many of his previous efforts, and it is arguably his best film to date.  The convoluted plot does require viewers to be attentive and exercise the gray matter, but the audience is rewarded for the effort with a fascinating and satisfying cinematic experience.The acting in 12 MONKEYS is top-notch, especially the work of the three principals.  As the time-traveling antihero, Bruce Willis delivers one of his greatest performances and is touchingly emotive as his character tries to accomplish his task while also retaining his health and sanity.  Playing a psychiatrist who eventually becomes Willis' love interest, the pretty Madeleine Stowe is convincingly as strong and intense or as vulnerable as the role demands.  And in his hilarious portrayal of a demented anarchist who also happens to be the son of a famous virologist, Brad Pitt fervently chews the scenery and nearly upstages his more experienced costars.Willis' struggle with the psychological aporia and culture shock of traveling backwards in time while he also pieces together a complicated but vital puzzle makes for a literate yet gripping science-fiction thriller that keeps viewers guessing right up to the final scene.  Yes, the plot is complicated and labyrinthine, but it all ultimately comes together in an intense and scintillating epiphany.  Ardent sci-fi fans will especially enjoy the final payoff, but even filmgoers not normally into the genre will find 12 MONKEYS to be an enjoyable flick.The standard DVD from Universal offers a nearly pristine digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen at the original aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  Also included are cool bonus goodies like a feature commentary with director Gilliam and producer Chuck Roven, a featurette made during the film's production, the original theatrical trailer, and more.  Universal also offers 12 MONKEYS on a special DVD that offers DTS Dolby sound, but apparently the better sound comes at the cost of bonus features.In short, 12 MONKEYS is a must-have for sci-fi fans, but all lovers of great cinema should be pleased to have this film in their DVD collections.",5,"When Filming This, Gilliam and Willis Didn't Monkey Around",1089158400,"07 7, 2004",2004,2644,"['Inspired', '1962', 'French', 'short', 'LA', 'JET', 'Eacute', 'E', 'unusual', 'film', 'director', 'Chris', 'Marker', 'narrative', 'collage', 'still', 'images', 'sci-fi', 'flick', '12', 'MONKEYS', 'story', 'tough', 'convict', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'circa', '2040', 'C.E', 'who', 'quot', 'volunteers', 'quot', 'travel', 'backwards', 'time', '1990s', 'mission', 'locate', 'source', 'viral', 'pandemic', 'will', 'wipe', 'out', 'more', '90', '%', 'Earth', 'population', 'year', '2000', 'opus', 'auteur', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'more', 'earnest', 'convincing', 'many', 'previous', 'efforts', 'arguably', 'best', 'film', 'date', 'convoluted', 'plot', 'require', 'viewers', 'be', 'attentive', 'exercise', 'gray', 'matter', 'audience', 'rewarded', 'effort', 'fascinating', 'satisfying', 'cinematic', 'experience.The', 'acting', '12', 'MONKEYS', 'top-notch', 'especially', 'work', 'three', 'principals', 'time-traveling', 'antihero', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'one', 'greatest', 'performances', 'touchingly', 'emotive', 'character', 'tries', 'accomplish', 'task', 'also', 'retaining', 'health', 'sanity', 'Playing', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'eventually', 'Willis', 'love', 'interest', 'pretty', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'convincingly', 'strong', 'intense', 'as', 'vulnerable', 'role', 'demands', 'hilarious', 'portrayal', 'demented', 'anarchist', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'son', 'famous', 'virologist', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'fervently', 'scenery', 'nearly', 'more', 'experienced', 'costars.Willis', 'struggle', 'psychological', 'aporia', 'culture', 'shock', 'traveling', 'backwards', 'time', 'also', 'together', 'complicated', 'vital', 'puzzle', 'literate', 'yet', 'gripping', 'science-fiction', 'thriller', 'viewers', 'guessing', 'right', 'up', 'final', 'scene', 'Yes', 'plot', 'complicated', 'labyrinthine', 'ultimately', 'together', 'intense', 'scintillating', 'epiphany', 'Ardent', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'will', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'final', 'payoff', 'even', 'filmgoers', 'not', 'normally', 'genre', 'will', 'find', '12', 'MONKEYS', 'be', 'enjoyable', 'flick.The', 'standard', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'nearly', 'pristine', 'digital', 'transfer', 'film', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'original', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'Also', 'included', 'are', 'cool', 'goodies', 'feature', 'commentary', 'director', 'Gilliam', 'producer', 'Chuck', 'Roven', 'featurette', 'made', 'film', 'production', 'original', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'more', 'Universal', 'also', '12', 'MONKEYS', 'special', 'DVD', 'DTS', 'Dolby', 'sound', 'apparently', 'better', 'sound', 'cost', 'bonus', 'features.In', 'short', '12', 'MONKEYS', 'must-have', 'sci-fi', 'fans', 'lovers', 'great', 'cinema', 'should', 'be', 'pleased', 'have', 'film', 'DVD', 'collections']",N/A

It features an incredible script that takes us back and forth between the past and the present and we see the lives of the main characters all intertwined over a period of six years. The film is quite complex, and even strange at times. But the one thing that it never fails to do is entertain you. The set designs and stunning visuals are one of the film's best features. The costume designs from the future could only be created by Terry Gilliam. He is the master of the unusual. The ending to the film is very shocking and ties all the events of the film together perfectly. While it will be upsetting to some, it was extremely satisfying and it made perfect sense.Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career with James Cole. There are so many things about the role that are pleasing. The first being his adjusting to the past, and living above ground. Willis accurately captures the suprise one in his situation would feel. The second being his fight to prove what he is saying about the present time is true. This is where she shows fierce determination. The third being his fight to remain sain and rational. Willis actually could pass for a mental patient. The transition from sane to insane is amazing to see. Madeline Stowe is sexy and intelligent as Dr. Kathryn Railly. Watching her go from skeptical doctor, to helping James on his mission is great. But the best performance however was given by Brad Pitt. Pitt is truly off of his rocker for the entire film and will not only make you laugh, but amaze and shock you with what he does as well.""12 Monkeys"" is a complex and beautiful masterpiece in the science fiction genre.

Fowler ""ben1283""","[1, 1]","Not knowing anything whatsoever about the plot of 12 Monkeys when I first sat down to watch it, I was at first disheartened by what seemed like a typical pulp fiction take on a familiar story.  The basic premise has Willis as survivor of a deadly infection that has killed 99% of the world's population, and who is sent back to the 90's to try and discover where the virus originated so that scientists in the future can discover a cure.  However, things start going wrong when he's sent back to 1990 rather than 1996 and finds himself locked up in a mental institution with stark-raving mad Brad Pitt as company and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe as company.  Believing that the virus is somehow connected to an underground ring calling themselves the army of the 12 Monkeys, Willis enlists Stowe to help him save the human race.As potentially hokey and clich&eacute;d as the plot may at first sound, it is a great credit to director Gillam that he manages to pull it off with such panache.  The apocalyptic bleakness of not only the future but the faded, bright and harsh present is brilliantly realised and visually this is a very impressive movie indeed.  Also impressive is that Gillam actually confronts the impracticalities of time travel, such as asking how can you change the past if it's already happened?  Along with this there is the recurrent theme of fate and destiny as Willis constantly flashes back to nightmarish images of his childhood where he saw a man being shot at an airport, a dream that only becomes clear to him (and to us) at the very end.Nods should also go to the performances of the film.  Willis again is nothing remarkable but this kind of movie is what he knows best, although given his subtler performance in The Sixth Sense some viewers may question why he doesn't take on more varied roles.  However, in fairness, 12 Monkeys cannot be seen as a conventional genre piece and in the same way Willis' character cannot be seen as conventional either.  Brad Pitt puts in yet another tour de force of a performance as a mental patient, again proving what a capable actor he is with a great deal of versatility (compare his role here to his roles in Interview With The Vampire, Fight Club and Snatch) that deservedly bagged him an Oscar nomination.  Stowe is also incredibly charismatic, giving a performance that refuses to pigeon-hole her as just an obligatory love interest.12 Monkeys works simply because it often weaves genres together, pumping new life into the apocalypse drama and the time travel story whilst still telling a pretty touching love story with a tragic ending.  Equal parts violent and passionate as it is bleak and ultimately depressing, it is small wonder that 12 Monkeys became an almost cult classic of its era.  It may not be a revelation but it's certainly different and unforgettable.",4,A visual treat of apocalyptic sci-fi,1042934400,"01 19, 2003",2003,2842,"['Not', 'knowing', 'anything', 'whatsoever', 'plot', '12', 'Monkeys', 'when', 'first', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'was', 'first', 'disheartened', 'what', 'seemed', 'typical', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'take', 'familiar', 'story', 'basic', 'premise', 'Willis', 'survivor', 'deadly', 'infection', 'killed', '99', '%', 'world', 'population', 'who', 'sent', 'back', '90', 'try', 'discover', 'where', 'virus', 'originated', 'so', 'scientists', 'future', 'can', 'discover', 'cure', 'However', 'things', 'start', 'going', 'wrong', 'when', 'sent', 'back', '1990', 'rather', '1996', 'locked', 'up', 'mental', 'institution', 'stark-raving', 'mad', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'company', 'beautiful', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'company', 'Believing', 'virus', 'somehow', 'connected', 'underground', 'ring', 'calling', 'army', '12', 'Monkeys', 'Willis', 'Stowe', 'help', 'save', 'human', 'race.As', 'potentially', 'hokey', 'clich', 'eacute', 'plot', 'may', 'first', 'sound', 'great', 'credit', 'director', 'Gillam', 'pull', 'off', 'such', 'panache', 'apocalyptic', 'bleakness', 'not', 'only', 'future', 'faded', 'bright', 'harsh', 'present', 'brilliantly', 'realised', 'visually', 'very', 'impressive', 'movie', 'indeed', 'Also', 'impressive', 'Gillam', 'actually', 'impracticalities', 'time', 'travel', 'such', 'asking', 'how', 'can', 'change', 'past', 'already', 'happened', 'recurrent', 'theme', 'fate', 'destiny', 'Willis', 'constantly', 'back', 'nightmarish', 'images', 'childhood', 'where', 'saw', 'man', 'being', 'shot', 'airport', 'dream', 'only', 'clear', 'very', 'end.Nods', 'should', 'also', 'go', 'performances', 'film', 'Willis', 'again', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'kind', 'movie', 'what', 'best', 'given', 'subtler', 'performance', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'viewers', 'may', 'question', 'why', ""n't"", 'take', 'more', 'varied', 'roles', 'However', 'fairness', '12', 'Monkeys', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'conventional', 'genre', 'piece', 'same', 'way', 'Willis', 'character', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'seen', 'conventional', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'yet', 'tour', 'force', 'performance', 'mental', 'patient', 'again', 'proving', 'what', 'capable', 'actor', 'great', 'deal', 'versatility', 'compare', 'role', 'here', 'roles', 'Interview', 'Vampire', 'Fight', 'Club', 'Snatch', 'deservedly', 'bagged', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Stowe', 'also', 'incredibly', 'charismatic', 'giving', 'performance', 'pigeon-hole', 'as', 'just', 'obligatory', 'love', 'interest.12', 'Monkeys', 'simply', 'often', 'genres', 'together', 'pumping', 'new', 'life', 'apocalypse', 'drama', 'time', 'travel', 'story', 'whilst', 'still', 'telling', 'pretty', 'touching', 'love', 'story', 'tragic', 'ending', 'Equal', 'parts', 'violent', 'passionate', 'bleak', 'ultimately', 'depressing', 'small', 'wonder', '12', 'Monkeys', 'became', 'almost', 'cult', 'classic', 'era', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'revelation', 'certainly', 'different', 'unforgettable']",N/A

Overall, it was solid but it left me a little wanting I guess.  Brad Pitts performance while cool at the beginning became very annoying after the 50th tantrum. This was character overkill.  Gilliam tends to do this so maybe I should have expected it?Bruce Willis was good as was Madeline Stowe. Sometimes this film just plodded along though and didnt quite know what to do next. There were scenes that lasted a little too long and a few of the same types of scenes over and over. Perhaps the subject material wasnt as deep as I wanted. Basically it was a PETA wacko trying to kill everyone on the planet and Willis was sent back in time to try and come up with the original virus to make a cure in the future.  Thats all cool but when it all was unfolding I just wasnt as thrilled as I thought I'd be.  Dare I say the film became dull in parts and I was wondering when things would come together...???

James Cole (Willis) is &quot;volunteered&quot; to travel back in time to trace the origins of a virus that will wipe out most of the humanity on the planet, but as he is slingshotted back and forth through time he begins to question his sanity and his perceptions of reality.  Along the way he is incarcerated in a mental asylum under the care of a psychiatrist who is strangely drawn to him (Stowe), and he encounters a deranged inmate (an Oscar nominated Pitt) on his journey to uncover the truth.  Willis is superb in his role, words can't describe it alone.  Pitt however, is more than worth noting, and his nomination for Best Supporting Actor was more than well deserved (his characterization of Jeffrey bears a striking similarity, albeit a few cans short of a six pack, to another role of Pitt's in Fight Club as Tyler Durden).  Gilliam's direction is as fantastic as it ever was.  Even though he had a relatively modest budget for a major studio, his uncanny vision makes the film work.  In the hands of another director, 12 Monkeys would have been a failure, in Gilliam's hands we get a dark yet witty apocalyptic film with riveting performances and an unforgettable climax that must be seen to be believed.

It almost  looked like there would be a happy ending to this video, but it's not the  case.  Watch it.  Another interesting aspect of this video was when Willis  came in and out of different time zones throughout the video.  His job was  to find the resource of the 12 Monkeys who would exterminate the human race  in 1996.  He had a band of scientists always crawling off his back wanting  to know his progress in preventing the 12 monkeys from causing world  destruction.  The video was a surprise to me.

49295,A1J2931UBBJPXM,078322172X,Reviewer,"[6, 6]","In the world of the mind and in the realm of the imagination, anything is possible-- even the ability to transport someone through time.  So suspend your disbelief for awhile, check it at the door, and launch yourself into ""12 Monkeys,"" an adventure directed by Terry Gilliam that takes you into the past by way of the future.  It begins sometime in the near future, a time in which the inhabitants of the Earth are forced to live underground, having been driven there in 1996, when a deadly virus was intentionally released into the atmosphere rendering the air unbreathable and ultimately killing five billion people.  Now scientists believe they have attained the capability of developing a way to make the air breathable again, in which case mankind will be able to return to the surface of the planet and rebuild a new world.  But their plan is contingent upon first acquiring a sample of the virus in it's original, pure form, rather than the mutated strains currently available to them.  This means that someone must be sent back to 1996 to collect data and locate the source of the virus, which would then enable them to send a scientist back to procure the needed sample.Thus far, though they have successfully implemented a system of time travel, their efforts have been for naught.  Using ""volunteers"" from the penal system, they have failed time and again for any number of reasons, not the least of which has to do with the lack of cooperation and effort put forth by their ""chosen"" few .  Now, however, they feel they have just the man for the job, a prisoner named James Cole (Bruce Willis), who has agreed to collect their necessary data in exchange for a full pardon.  The biggest problem seems to be that their ""time targeting"" isn't exactly precise.  They have information that will help Cole once he gets there-- a cryptic message they uncovered points to a high profile group known as the ""Army of the 12 Monkeys"" as being responsible for unleashing the virus-- and if they can just land Cole sometime before December of `96, he'll be able to track them down.  So, Cole suits up-- and the adventure begins.As he did with his 1985 film, ""Brazil,"" Gilliam here has created a bizarre world that seems to have been dropped through the looking glass.  He presents a future that comes through as something of a subterranean version of the world in ""Blade Runner;"" a bit darker and with the definition of a reflection in a fun house mirror.  And it's all quite effective, especially in contrast to the ""real"" world of the past in which Cole finds himself.  But what really makes it interesting and keeps the audience involved is the fact that you know everything that Cole knows, which allows you to share his frustration in dealing with an unimaginable situation, and it makes it a tense and exciting experience.  It works because Gilliam has created a very real fantasy world, as well as a believable ""present"" that for the purpose of the film is actually the ""past.""  The plot becomes fairly complex at times, but after a couple of twists and turns, it all comes together and makes sense in the end.Bruce Willis does a good job in this one, creating a character that is actually quite unlike any other he's ever done.  Cole is certainly heroic, but not in the same straightforward manner as John McClane in the ""Die Hard"" series, or the more subtle, understated hero of ""Unbreakable,"" David Dunn.  And the emotional character development you see in Cole is credibly realized, for which Willis and Gilliam both deserve a nod of recognition, as it's a good piece of acting by Willis and a demonstration of Gilliam's ability as a director.  It all comes about quite naturally through the narrative of the story, which makes it believable and very real.Brad Pitt, meanwhile, practically steals the show in his supporting role as Jeffrey Goines, the well-to-do idealist with sensibilities that are just a notch off center.  It's a memorable character, created with nuance and detail, and he deservedly received an Oscar nomination for it.  Also giving a notable performance is Madeleine Stowe as Dr. Kathryn Railly, the psychiatrist who meets up with Cole and attempts to sort out his psyche while trying to find out just who he really is and where he came from.The supporting cast includes Jon Seda (Jose), Christopher Plummer (Dr. Goines), David Morse (Dr. Peters), Frank Gorshin (Dr. Fletcher) and Michael Chance (Scarface).  With an ending worthy of M. Night Shyamalan, ""12 Monkeys"" is an engrossing action/suspense/drama that will keep you going until the very end.  And in retrospect, few movies fall just outside of a specific genre or category the way this one does, so for the sake of argument, I'll create one and call it ""Gilliam Noir""-- a new genre especially for Gilliam's films (and others like them), including ""Brazil"" and ""The Fisher King.""  Unique films that deserve their own unique place as paragons of cinematic achievement.

49304,A1K94LXX833JTT,078322172X,Sanpete,"[46, 52]","12 Monkeys is a convoluted tale of time travel, insanity, apocalypse, and who-done-it, with some romance thrown in.  What I enjoyed most about it was the twisting and ambiguous path it followed, which was fresh and well thought out, to a point.Bruce Willis plays Cole, a prisoner in a post-apocalyptic future recruited to do some dangerous time-travel work in the past for a group of very odd scientists.  The goal of the work only becomes apparent later, and by then there is confusion about whether Cole is really on the mission he thinks he is or is just deluded.  Brad Pitt has a major supporting role hamming it up as another who may or may not be insane.Ultimately, while I don't think the film does full justice to its premises and possibilities, it does well enough to be entertaining and thought provoking.  Director Terry Gilliam's surrealism adds much.  The acting is very good on the whole, itself rather surreal in some of the supporting roles.  There is some violence showing how disturbed Willis's character is, not bad for an R-rated movie.  It's definitely worth seeing to judge for yourself what it's really about.I want to comment on the things you think about after the film is over, to see how well it holds up.  I'll have to go into details you may not want to know about if you haven't seen the film yet, thus the spoiler alert.  If you'd like to know what my general conclusions are, without any spoilers, just skip to the last couple paragraphs headed ""In Sum.""*SPOILER ALERT*MadnessThere are many points designed to suggest that parts of the film are delusions, but they're balanced by points seeming to show the opposite.  There is the over-the-top strangeness of the future (the video ball, serenading scientists, etc.), the obvious parallels between the psych ward and the future prison (similar panels of doctors/scientists, the two guards, etc), the voice that calls Cole ""Bob"" (moving around as if in his head, though it seems to belong to the wino too), the music in the ruined department store (apparently a premonition (or something) of the time Cole is there in 1996), the lion and bear (again paralleled in 1996, unlikely denizens of a wintry abandoned Philadelphia).But then Cole's disappearances, the French that Cole himself doesn't understand in WWI (yes, it's real French), the photo of Cole from WWI (though nearly impossibly convenient), the WWI bullet, Cole's knowledge of the boy in the well prank, all seem to settle things conclusively against delusion.  That is, unless we're to imagine that not only the future but the whole film is delusions, of Cole (or Bob) and/or Railly, in line with her own fears and the comment by the virus culprit (Morse) that Railly might be succumbing to her Cassandra syndrome.  Confusing?  That's what Gilliam was aiming for.In a way, the view that the whole film is largely delusion seems the most coherent overall interpretation, in that it can explain away all failures of logic.  But it has trouble explaining how good the logic is.  The film, strange and muddled as it is, really does seem far too lucid and coherent to be primarily be a string of delusions.The End, Time TravelThe ending has stirred much debate.  The woman sitting next to the culprit on the plane is one of the scientists from the future.  She is presumably there to do exactly what Cole said the scientists planned to do, gather a sample of the virus from before it mutated.  According to Cole, the scientists didn't send him to change the past, which he says is impossible.  He was sent to gather information, which he did.  We must assume that the sample is gathered and that this enables humanity in the future to return to the surface of the planet.  It doesn't help the 5 billion killed.That appears to be the basic sense of the ending, but it has its own loose ends.  Why was Cole given the gun, if not to try to change the past?  (Jose's line that it's too bad they didn't get the information sooner makes no sense to me in the context of time travel.)  The scientist introduces herself on the plane saying, ""I'm in insurance,"" which is a great line if she's a backup for Cole, in case he fails to stop the spread of the virus.  But that too implies he could have changed the past.  Even getting a sample of the virus seems to change the past.  Trying to figure out the point of all of this is further complicated by the the fact that we are shown the virus being released by the culprit when it was being inspected at the airport.  By the time Cole tried to shoot him it was already too late.  This adds to the pathos, and the confusion.Some views of time travel allow the past (and future) to change.  It could work this way.  Young Cole goes to the airport, there is no shooting, he survives the virus, and is eventually sent back, where he is shot, witnessed by young Cole, who survives the virus and is eventually sent back, where he remembers the shooting and gets shot (the scene we see near the end of the film).  This would allow one more twist in the film, one suspected by some optimistic viewers.  Railly, recognizing the boy Cole, would tell the boy to remember that the culprit wasn't the 12 monkeys gang but Dr. Goine's assistant.  Then Cole could conceivably grow up and loop back one more time, this time preventing the virus from ever being released, and getting the girl.  There is no hint of this, however.  Had the filmmakers wanted to hint at the possibility, they easily could have (by having Railly whisper something in the boy Cole's ear, for example).In SumAll in all, the film is stimulating and fun but ultimately more frustrating than it might have been.  I like a film that provokes thought, but I tend to prefer one that rewards it with additional insights and clarity.  That only goes so far here, and then things seem impossible, muddled or otherwise unsatisfying.  There is a certain postmodern sensibility that prefers just this kind of lack of clarity and incomplete logic.  I don't know if that was intended here or just came about accidentally (I suspect some of each), but if that sensibility is your thing, you should love this film.The DVD anamorphic video and 5.1 audio quality are fine.  There is commentary track with director Gilliam and producer Charles Roven, and a full-length making-of documentary.  Both are interesting and worth the time, but don't expect answers to the puzzles the film leaves, other than a hint or two expressed as personal opinion.",4,"A film fascinating, fun and

This would be a saner world indeed if the movies of Gilliam and his collaborators were as popular and as discussed as those of derivative hacks like George Lucas; I predict that Gilliam's are the movies that will be studied, and revered, by future scholars of film, should we - and the form - survive.  And no speculative film of the 1990s - with the possible exception of Gilliams's own, more realistic &quot;The Fisher King&quot; - got anywhere near the tragic beauty, dramatic intensity, or sheer breath-taking scope of vision in &quot;12 Monkeys.&quot;  It's a sad commentary on the state of our collective literacy that a complex movie like this one is considered &quot;confusing&quot; rather than exhilerating, and whose emotional canvas, subtle and devastating, is deemed cold and out of reach.

The time travel intrigue is very credibly done and the plot is riveting. The decor looks cobbled together from the debris of the 20th century. Cities are either scabby Skid Rows or towering skyscrapers. Scientists still work in laboratories that look like old postcards of Thomas Edison inventing. Bizarre killers and villains are hurled at our protagonist (Cole, played by Willis), and there are many bloody fights.Bruce Willis is superb in his rendition of a man from the future, especially his impish reverie on listening to simple music. Brad Pitt does more than he typically does in movies, which is perhaps why he overdoes it. He almost makes the manman he plays a laughable caricature.But all of this is just the plumbing for what the movie is really about -- its vision. With a little pondering, forced or naturally invoked, one can actually identify with all the craziness of this movie.

I watched this movie for a second time when I bought the DVD, as I also have the Laser Disc. Upon second viewing, I was shocked at how much I had missed getting caught up in the plot twists and action. I read the reviews, and feel this important aspect of the movie has not been mentioned. The movie drops a lot of enigmatic hints, a la the Sixth Sense and A Beautiful Mind, as to what is real and not real. You really have to watch for them. For example: some of the things he remembers seeing in the &quot;future&quot;, he sees again when he goes back into the past, to places where he's never been. How are &quot;memories&quot; from the FUTURE possible? Especially when Bruce says he's never been above ground before! How can one have &quot;deja vu&quot; after travelling to the past? Even Bruce has a confused look on his face whenever one of these clues to his mental state are realized. Also the bit the previous reviewer mentioned about the lady scientist on the plane. Which did he see first, or did he see just one, and imagine the other. Was he really ever in the future? Is he imagining it all? The movie leaves it up to you to decide whether Bruce Willis is from the future and saves the world, or whether he's just crazy, and we are seeing this from a crazy persons viewpoint. It's done so subtley that getting caught up in the dramatic story, one can miss the clues. I didnt catch this upon the first viewing, many images Bruce see's in the story are repeated, so as to imply that Willis was imagining things, or was he? Also, in scenes where Madeline Stowe is convinced he's from the future, they are alone! If one removes the scenes where he's ALONE with people, the case can be made that the entire adventure is imagined!Also, he says he's not crazy, but he hears voices when he's in the hospital, and he pulls out his teeth, because they've got radio transmitters in them! And the voice he hears in his head is from somebody he meets LATER in the film for the first time. Or maybe he IS crazy and knew him before he imagined he was a time traveller! So did he imagine them?  The reviewer before me was left with questions about the scientist from the &quot;future&quot; being on the plane. This is the last clue they leave you with, and it messes with your head. If one watches the movie starting with the premise that Bruce is crazy, the movie is another movie!  UNLIKE the Sixth Sense or Usual Suspects, this movie does'nt give you the big dramatic payoff at the end, when you find out what the truth is. That big payoff made one want to see the Sixth Sense again to see the clues you then knew must exist.Monkey's just leaves you hanging.So you can enjoy it on two levels. This movie totally messes with your head. I'll save you some time: Bruce Willis is crazy and 12 Monkey's are the imaginings of a paranoid schitzophrenic. Or are they?

It has it's own chapters list and gives great insight into the making of the film. It runs at least an  hour and is hands down the best documentary I have ever seen. It seems to  have been produced by Gilliam as insurance that the studio system couldn't  screw him over. This is a carryover from his experience making 'Brazil'  within the studio system. I was greatly disappointed with the commentary.  Gilliam usually gives good commentary; 'Time Bandits' and 'The Life of  Brian' are good examples. Here he seems to ramble, be verbose and go off in  tangents for most of the film. Gilliam and Roven talk about making a  relatively high budget film, for the time, within the studio system; things  like choosing actors, locations, how to spend the money and other general  facts about film making.

I will just rave... 12 Monkeys is the most breathtaking piece of recursive temporal symmetry since Joyce's Finnegan's Wake. Perhaps one of the most perfectly conceived and executed movies of all time - up there with Blade Runner and Jacob's Ladder.While the Wake is structured around a recursive temporal spiral, overlaying an archetypally-driven consciousness matrix, 12 Monkeys is necessarily simpler, because of its movie format. Yet the movie generates the same transcendent majesty as the concluding temporal convergence reveals to the viewer that this has been as much a spiritual odyssey as a brilliantly constructed Science Fiction story.Without giving anything away, the bitter-sweet climax is one of the most stunning and uplifting scenes in the history of the film industry.

49318,A3U56M0Y8LYO6J,078322172X,"Steven Y. ""Pop Culture Addict""","[8, 9]","Terry Gilliam, to say the very least, is a director who makes interesting films.  Some of his films turn out to be good while others turn out to be puzzling.  His ""12 Monkeys"" is a film that skews toward the ""good"" side of the scale.  It is not a conventional film in any sense of the word but it is an intriguing brain-teaser that will have you mulling over the implications of time travel paradoxes long after the end credits have finished.A man named Cole (Bruce Willis) is tapped for a mission.  He lives in a future devastated by a plague that originated in 1996.  Cole is told to go back in time and collect information on the virus that unleashed the plague.  After emerging in 1990, he is imprisoned and turned over to Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe).  After escaping, he reappears in 1996 and contacts Railly once more.  After some investigating, the trail of the mysterious 12 monkeys that hold the secret of the coming disaster leads to Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), an animal rights activist who may or may not be planning to give the planet back to the animals.""12 Monkeys"" is a wonder of production design.  Its vision of a ravaged future is bleak and unsettling.  This is no utopia but a desolate land that reeks of desperation and decay.  Gilliam's representation of the modern world is also sobering as it is a place that is slowly descending into chaos because of humankind's close-mindedness and arrogance.  The complexity of the script demands quality performances to make the film work and Willis and Pitt are up to the challenge.  The disorientation that Willis so effectively conveys is a vital reason for the success of the film as it provides the audience with someone to identify with.  Stowe also shines in her role and proves once again that she has unfairly been one of the most overlooked actresses of the last ten years.  All in all, ""12 Monkeys"" is an entertaining film that is worth watching.",3,"""Maybe the human race deserves to be wiped out.""",1070323200,"12 2, 2003",2003,1928,"['Terry', 'Gilliam', 'say', 'very', 'least', 'director', 'who', 'interesting', 'films', 'films', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'others', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'puzzling', '12', 'Monkeys', 'film', 'good', 'side', 'scale', 'not', 'conventional', 'film', 'sense', 'word', 'intriguing', 'brain-teaser', 'will', 'have', 'mulling', 'implications', 'time', 'travel', 'paradoxes', 'long', 'end', 'credits', 'have', 'finished.A', 'man', 'named', 'Cole', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'tapped', 'mission', 'future', 'devastated', 'plague', 'originated', '1996', 'Cole', 'told', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'collect', 'information', 'virus', 'unleashed', 'plague', 'emerging', '1990', 'imprisoned', 'turned', 'Dr.', 'Kathryn', 'Railly', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'escaping', '1996', 'contacts', 'Railly', 'once', 'more', 'investigating', 'trail', 'mysterious', '12', 'monkeys', 'hold', 'secret', 'coming', 'disaster', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'animal', 'rights', 'activist', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'planning', 'give', 'planet', 'back', 'animals', '12', 'Monkeys', 'wonder', 'production', 'design', 'vision', 'ravaged', 'future', 'bleak', 'unsettling', 'utopia', 'desolate', 'land', 'desperation', 'decay', 'Gilliam', 'representation', 'modern', 'world', 'also', 'sobering', 'place', 'slowly', 'descending', 'chaos', 'humankind', 'close-mindedness', 'arrogance', 'complexity', 'script', 'quality', 'performances', 'make', 'film', 'work', 'Willis', 'Pitt', 'are', 'up', 'challenge', 'disorientation', 'Willis', 'so', 'effectively', 'conveys', 'vital', 'reason', 'success', 'film', 'audience', 'someone', 'identify', 'Stowe', 'also', 'role', 'once', 'again', 'unfairly', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'overlooked', 'actresses', 'last', 'ten', 'years', '12', 'Monkeys', 'entertaining', 'film', 'worth', 'watching']",N/A

The type of film that you have to cherish every minute of. Of course, we can always count on bizarro god Terry Gilliam, creator of Brazil, to bring us something a little less ordinary than your generic Hollywood drivel.12 Monkeys is the uncanny tale of James Cole, an incarcerated sociopath in the year 2035 and a survivor of the plague that wiped out 99% of the population in the years 1996 and 1997. This plague was supposedly spread by ""The Army Of The Twelve Monkeys"". James was to be sent back to the year 1996 to investigate it and gather information by a team of eccentric scientists, but something went wrong, and he was sent to 1990. He is then arrested and put in an insane asylum because of his talk of time travel and the lethal virus he was sent to investigate. In this asylum he meets Jeffrey Goines, another patient who also happens to be the son of a famous scientist and expert on viruses. Jeffrey helps James escape, but he is captured and put in an empty room strapped to a bed. He is then brought back to 2035 by the group of scientists. He's sent back to 1996, as originally planned, and kidnaps his doctor at the insane asylum. Things escalate. I don't want to spoil this intriguing story for you.I strongly suggest all thinkers go out and rent yourself a copy of this great film.

The fact that today's society is responsible for what may become of the future in the near tomorrow, and that our own abuses and refusals to see what is right before out eyes are at the very center of all of these stories, whether they are good or bad.  ""12 Monkeys"", director Terry Gilliam's take on the excellent ""La Jetee"" is a hokey, yet extremely dark, sinister, and overwhelmingly entertaining venture into the depths of a future that is severely in doubt.  Somewhere in the distant future, all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out five billion people in 1996, leaving only one percent of the population alive. James Cole is one of them; a prisoner who lives in a small cage and who is chosen as a ""volunteer"" to be sent back to in time to gather information about the origin of the epidemic. They believe it was spread by a mysterious group called ""The 12 Monkeys"" and need the virus before it mutated, so that scientists can study it. But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe), a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert.  With Railly at his side, Cole is thrown into a race against time to discover the leader of the Twelve Monkeys and end the epidemic in order to save mankind.Brad Pitt steals most scenes, filling them with a patented loony, off-the-wall performance that deservedly garnered him an Oscar nomination, while Bruce Willis gives the one of the best performances of his career, not reverting to his heroic cliches and cardboard hero; instead portraying Cole as a simple, poignant, tragic everyman. Equally good is Madeline Stowe as Willis' psychologist, holding her own by injecting her character with both wild energy and strength as she collapses under the weight of what she comes to believe is a false ""religion"".  Paul Buckmaster creates an original, timeless score that punctuates the wild mood swings Willis' character endures. As Willis acts out the questioning of his own sanity, a desire to be what he calls ""well"", and eventually his acceptance of a patently impossible situation, Buckmaster's score delivers a suitably downbeat punctuation. The music is part of what makes the misery of the situation so tangible. Gilliam's expert, overwhelming, and complex handling of what could have been a routine action/sci-fi film makes ""12 Monkeys"" a compelling vision of a nightmarish, futuristic landscape. Its rich, well-thought out, intricate storyline along with solid performances from the entire cast and its brooding, bleak cinematography make it a gripping treat of madness.",4,12 Monkeys  (1995),1135900800,"12 30, 2005",2005,3046,"['Director', 'Terry', 'GilliamCast', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'Frank', 'Gorshin', 'Carol', 'Florence', 'David', 'Morse', 'Harry', ""O'Toole.Running"", 'Time', '129', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'violence', 'language.Stories', 'possibility', 'post-apocalyptic', 'future', 'have', 'been', 'ages', 'very', 'creation', 'science-fiction', 'genre', 'se', 'fact', 'today', 'society', 'responsible', 'what', 'may', 'become', 'future', 'near', 'tomorrow', 'own', 'abuses', 'refusals', 'see', 'what', 'right', 'eyes', 'are', 'very', 'center', 'stories', 'are', 'good', 'bad', '12', 'Monkeys', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'take', 'excellent', 'La', 'Jetee', 'hokey', 'yet', 'extremely', 'dark', 'sinister', 'overwhelmingly', 'entertaining', 'venture', 'depths', 'future', 'severely', 'doubt', 'Somewhere', 'distant', 'future', 'people', 'live', 'underground', 'unknown', 'lethal', 'virus', 'wiped', 'out', 'five', 'billion', 'people', '1996', 'leaving', 'only', 'one', 'percent', 'population', 'alive', 'James', 'Cole', 'one', 'prisoner', 'who', 'small', 'cage', 'who', 'chosen', 'volunteer', 'be', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'gather', 'information', 'origin', 'epidemic', 'believe', 'was', 'spread', 'mysterious', 'group', 'called', '12', 'Monkeys', 'need', 'virus', 'mutated', 'scientists', 'can', 'study', 'time', 'traveling', 'machine', ""n't"", 'work', 'perfectly', 'yet', 'accidentally', 'sent', '1990', 'where', 'Dr.', 'Kathryn', 'Railly', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'psychiatrist', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'insane', 'son', 'famous', 'scientist', 'virus', 'expert', 'Railly', 'side', 'Cole', 'thrown', 'race', 'time', 'discover', 'leader', 'Twelve', 'Monkeys', 'end', 'epidemic', 'order', 'save', 'mankind.Brad', 'Pitt', 'most', 'scenes', 'filling', 'patented', 'loony', 'off-the-wall', 'performance', 'deservedly', 'garnered', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'one', 'best', 'performances', 'career', 'not', 'reverting', 'heroic', 'cliches', 'cardboard', 'hero', 'instead', 'portraying', 'Cole', 'simple', 'poignant', 'tragic', 'everyman', 'Equally', 'good', 'Madeline', 'Stowe', 'Willis', 'psychologist', 'holding', 'own', 'injecting', 'character', 'wild', 'energy', 'strength', 'weight', 'what', 'believe', 'false', 'religion', 'Paul', 'Buckmaster', 'original', 'timeless', 'score', 'wild', 'mood', 'swings', 'Willis', 'character', 'endures', 'Willis', 'out', 'questioning', 'own', 'sanity', 'desire', 'be', 'what', 'well', 'eventually', 'acceptance', 'patently', 'impossible', 'situation', 'Buckmaster', 'score', 'suitably', 'downbeat', 'punctuation', 'music', 'part', 'what', 'misery', 'situation', 'so', 'tangible', 'Gilliam', 'expert', 'overwhelming', 'complex', 'handling', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'routine', 'action/sci-fi', 'film', '12', 'Monkeys', 'compelling', 'vision', 'nightmarish', 'futuristic', 'landscape', 'rich', 'well-thought', 'out', 'intricate', 'storyline', 'solid', 'performances', 'entire', 'cast', 'brooding', 'bleak', 'cinematography', 'make', 'gripping', 'treat', 'madness']",N/A

49324,A2YY1USSAN78F6,078322172X,"Thomas Galasso ""S.F. to Detroit & Back Again""","[4, 4]","Where to begin ?  12 Monkeys is an exceptional work from acclaimed director Terry Gilliam (Brazil, The Brothers Grimm, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas etc.), a work that challenges the mind in more ones than most people would like.The film is loosely based on French filmmaker Chris Marker's silent short La Jetee.  Heavily inspired by the New Wave films of the 1960's most notably Alphaville, 12 Monkeys is a sort of existential science fiction piece one that deals with time travel, biological terrorism, the health system, and paranoia among other things.We follow mental patient by the name of James Cole (Bruce Willis) who is sent back in time to the 1990's to try and stop events that will lead to an apocalyptic virus that wipes out more than 90% of the Earth's population.  Again I will not spoil this for those who haven't seen it.From a visual standpoint once again Gilliam proves to be an innovator.  He tends to shot at odd angles which create a sense of discomfort for the average viewer, it heightens the sense of somethng not being right, or not normal.  Again we are treated to many rather odd bits of technology that seem overly complicated and antiquated, another thing that seems to puzzle many viewers.  When the average person thinks of the future they always tend to imagine sleek, beautiful sterile environments but with Gilliam we take a trip back into the Machine Age, back to expressionism.For those wondering what exactly a man like Bruce Willis does in a science fiction art piece without much action or any one-liners, well...he pulls from his repeated viewings of De Niro in Taxi Driver and creates a very disoriented slightly off, and out of touch main character that at times one cannot tell what his motives truly are.  In essence a very odd character that is full of emotion and raises many questions.See this if you have not, every film student should be in the know about this Gilliam effort.-Thomas Galasso",5,Terry Gilliam At His Finest !,1136764800,"01 9, 2006",2006,1942,"['Where', 'begin', '12', 'Monkeys', 'exceptional', 'work', 'acclaimed', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'Brazil', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'Fear', 'Loathing', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'etc', 'work', 'mind', 'more', 'ones', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'like.The', 'film', 'loosely', 'based', 'French', 'filmmaker', 'Chris', 'Marker', 'silent', 'short', 'La', 'Jetee', 'Heavily', 'inspired', 'New', 'Wave', 'films', '1960', 'most', 'notably', 'Alphaville', '12', 'Monkeys', 'sort', 'existential', 'science', 'fiction', 'piece', 'one', 'time', 'travel', 'biological', 'terrorism', 'health', 'system', 'paranoia', 'other', 'things.We', 'follow', 'mental', 'patient', 'name', 'James', 'Cole', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'who', 'sent', 'back', 'time', '1990', 'try', 'stop', 'events', 'will', 'lead', 'apocalyptic', 'virus', 'out', 'more', '90', '%', 'Earth', 'population', 'Again', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'it.From', 'visual', 'standpoint', 'once', 'again', 'Gilliam', 'be', 'innovator', 'shot', 'odd', 'angles', 'create', 'sense', 'discomfort', 'average', 'viewer', 'sense', 'somethng', 'not', 'being', 'right', 'not', 'normal', 'are', 'treated', 'many', 'rather', 'odd', 'bits', 'technology', 'seem', 'overly', 'complicated', 'antiquated', 'thing', 'puzzle', 'many', 'viewers', 'When', 'average', 'person', 'thinks', 'future', 'always', 'tend', 'imagine', 'sleek', 'beautiful', 'sterile', 'environments', 'Gilliam', 'take', 'trip', 'back', 'Machine', 'Age', 'back', 'expressionism.For', 'wondering', 'what', 'exactly', 'man', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'science', 'fiction', 'art', 'piece', 'much', 'action', 'one-liners', 'well', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'De', 'Niro', 'Taxi', 'Driver', 'very', 'disoriented', 'slightly', 'touch', 'main', 'character', 'times', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'tell', 'what', 'motives', 'truly', 'are', 'essence', 'very', 'odd', 'character', 'full', 'emotion', 'many', 'questions.See', 'have', 'not', 'film', 'student', 'should', 'be', 'know', 'Gilliam', 'effort.-Thomas', 'Galasso']",N/A

Set in shifting time frames (from the first world war to a post-apocalyptic 2035), Willis is trying to capture a virus that wiped out most of civilization and drove the survivors underground. Gilliam makes the future with the same hallucinogenic fervor that made hisBrazila classic, especially the snow-covered Philadelphia where Willis encounters a lion in front of Wanamaker's.Pitt, as a deranged mental patient turned potential terrorist scene steals whenever he is on-screen (think of a more restrained Tyler Durden fromFight Club), and he plays a pivotal role in leading Willis to the source of the infections. Madeline Stowe is terrific as the Psychiatrist who forms a bond with Willis, slowly coming to the realization that all her training has left her unprepared for what the future may have in store.Throughout the movie, there are imaginative uses of character and background, making Philadelphia the ground zero of the virus. Again, Gilliam's trademark visuals add so much to the film that ""12 Monkeys"" pushes itself above the usual time-travel and End of The World Science Fiction.

The information overload is softened by arresting visuals and soon enough the situation is clear: a man from the future (Bruce Willis) is sent back in time twice for a sample of the virus that has killed everyone in the present except those living underground. A psychiatrist (Madeline Stowe) who thinks he's crazy in 1990 comes to believe him in 1996, but both are too late to thwart the plague and he is killed by the secret service.That seems to be the story. This is science fiction, so coherence isn't needed. It's also a Terry Gilliam film, so imagination is. ""Twelve Monkeys"" has enough invention, flashy acting (Brad Pitt got an Oscar nod) and surface glitter to sustain three movies. Too much of a good thing? Maybe, except that Gilliam here controls his material, not always the case with this director (see his 2005 Grimm brothers fiasco.) He plays his actors to their strengths (Christopher Plummer is Pitt's scientist father) and his camera stays with them, exploring each scene, not missing a trick.Nor will the attentive viewer. Gilliam's production and lighting designs boggle the mind. An airport sequence with a small boy and strange adults is edited into the movie piecemeal, mystifying as it unfolds but paying off at the end, with its stunning final revelation.

It is this very quality of the movie, which makes it too overbearingly sickening, and at the same time, a really good one, and worth pondering on.The whole movie revolves around time-travel. This itself sounds a bit insane. If this is not enough, the muddled characters, and the disturbingly unimaginable path the movie goes through, only to reach a seemingly absurd end, could prove to be too much on the senses; and if one is looking for even a teensy weensy bit of reality, then this movie has all the essential elements to render it as one of the worst sci-fi ever.On the flipside, the movie also has all the sine qua non of a very well-made science-fiction flick, only if taken in the right sense.

It was inspired by Chris Marker's brilliant short film Le Jete; written by David Peeples and his spouse (co-screenwriter of Blade Runner, writer of The Unforgiven and Solider); stars Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe and directed by Monty Python's Terry Gilliam. It was also released by the very same studio that tried to butcher his masterpiece Brazil during the 80's. Who'd have thunk?The plot is fairly straight forward for a Gilliam directed film: Bruce Willis is a convict sent back in time to find information on a deadly virus that destroys much of  humanity. The survivors have to move underground (somewhat like in The Time Machine).This virus also insinuates itself into the environment making it impossible for humanity to return to the surface.  Willis is to report whatever he finds out before returning home. For doing all this he'll receive a pardon. They want to find information on the 12 Monkeys the terrorist group that took responsibility for the attack and prevent it from occurring.Willis meets a therapist played by Madeline Stowe when he's taken to a mental institution in our world. It's clear that he's disturbed but is that due to the travel through time? Did his fragmented mind make up the entire story? Stowe has to deal with all of this when she is kidnapped later in the film. Willis has fallen in love with her and tries to convince her his tale is true. Now they're on the run from the police and must find out who is behind the 12 Monkeys and where they have the virus.The performances are sharp. Willis is particularly good at playing the sad sack time traveler condemned to wonder if he is insane or truly on a hero's mission. Stowe plays the therapist well and injects humanity into a role that could have been routine in the wrong hands. Brad Pitt plays his most bizarre and interesting role yet. I don't recall if he was nominated for an Academy Award but he should have been.Gilliam's direction is self assured and powerful. He manages to blur the real and imagined in such a way that we're not certain about Willis' sanity. This interesting group of talented artists have created a terrific movie. It's not for everyone though as Gilliam's dark view of humanity and his use of satire might not appeal to everyone.

His vision of life after a plague has wiped out most of humanity is pretty convincing. And you have to wonder why he would imagine a future so degrading to himself. But then he starts hearing voices and decides he is insane and there is no future apocaplypse. He's dragged back to the future a few more times (and you don't know if it's real or imaginary) and is eventually told that he has solved the case, the scientists will prevent the end of the world. But he time travels back to the present and sees himself as a youngster watching himself die when he is killed. (An event he describes earlier in the film, but from his child's eye, with which he saw it, he saw someone else die.) Even  the closing sequence is ambiguous. Is the woman who sits down next to the guy who sets off the killer plague from the future (she is one of the future scientists who interrogates Willis) or is it just a bizarre coincidence?Gilliam's accomplishment is to make this entirely schizophrenic film both interesting and popular.

49340,AP3B615GM191G,078322172X,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[9, 12]","Currently, the topic of ""time travel"" is all the rage these days due to the incredible mind of JJ Abrams and a little show (you may have heard of it) called LOST.  However, unless you hold a degree in quantum physics and can wrap your head around such concepts as Schrodinger's Cat or the Many-Worlds theory, the concepts that LOST throws around may be a bit overwhelming and a little frustrating.  Fortunately, ""12 Monkeys"" provides what LOST cannot: a mind-bending time-travel plot that is both intellectually stimulating, yet easy enough to understand if one just pays close attention.The basic plot of the film centers on James Cole (Bruce Willis), a prisoner from ""the future"" (1997; where all surviving humans now live underground due to an apocalyptic event), who is sent back in time to try and gather information to prevent the catastrophe.  While skipping through time, Cole meets two people, Dr. Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and mental patient Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who ultimately prove crucial to his mission of saving humanity from an underground existence.The brilliance of this film is that, although most time-travel plots are either overwhelming (LOST) or too simple (think Star Trek episodes), director Terry Gilliam manages to find the perfect mix.  Upon completion of viewing, I was quite certain that I understood what had just transpired (a feat never to be overlooked when dealing with time-travel).  Only after some auxiliary study did I begin to consider some alternate interpretations, none of which cheapen that original reaction in any way.The acting is also very solid, with Willis progressing the Cole character very nicely (from completely lost--like the viewers--to informed and ready for action), Pitt turning in a good show as the manic Goines, and Stowe portraying the ""straight gal"" who, like our minds, must be convinced that all of this is really happening.Thus, I would recommend ""12 Monkeys"" to any and all fans of science fiction, mystery, suspense, and action films for its ability to strike the right balance between mind-stimulating material and utter confusion.  Plus, it is a film that can easily be viewed multiple times, as little tidbits can be picked up each time through.",5,The Crown Jewel Of Time Travel Films,1273449600,"05 10, 2010",2010,2224,"['Currently', 'topic', 'time', 'travel', 'rage', 'days', 'due', 'incredible', 'mind', 'JJ', 'Abrams', 'little', 'show', 'may', 'have', 'heard', 'called', 'LOST', 'However', 'hold', 'degree', 'quantum', 'physics', 'can', 'wrap', 'head', 'such', 'concepts', 'Schrodinger', 'Cat', 'Many-Worlds', 'theory', 'concepts', 'LOST', 'throws', 'around', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'overwhelming', 'little', 'frustrating', 'Fortunately', '12', 'Monkeys', 'what', 'LOST', 'can', 'not', 'mind-bending', 'time-travel', 'plot', 'intellectually', 'stimulating', 'yet', 'easy', 'enough', 'understand', 'one', 'just', 'close', 'attention.The', 'basic', 'plot', 'film', 'centers', 'James', 'Cole', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'prisoner', 'future', '1997', 'where', 'surviving', 'humans', 'now', 'live', 'underground', 'due', 'apocalyptic', 'event', 'who', 'sent', 'back', 'time', 'try', 'gather', 'information', 'prevent', 'catastrophe', 'skipping', 'time', 'Cole', 'two', 'people', 'Dr.', 'Railly', 'Madeleine', 'Stowe', 'mental', 'patient', 'Jeffrey', 'Goines', 'Brad', 'Pitt', 'who', 'ultimately', 'prove', 'crucial', 'mission', 'saving', 'humanity', 'underground', 'existence.The', 'brilliance', 'film', 'most', 'time-travel', 'plots', 'are', 'overwhelming', 'LOST', 'too', 'simple', 'think', 'Star', 'Trek', 'episodes', 'director', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'find', 'perfect', 'mix', 'completion', 'viewing', 'was', 'quite', 'certain', 'understood', 'what', 'had', 'just', 'transpired', 'feat', 'never', 'be', 'overlooked', 'when', 'dealing', 'time-travel', 'Only', 'auxiliary', 'study', 'did', 'begin', 'consider', 'alternate', 'interpretations', 'none', 'cheapen', 'original', 'reaction', 'way.The', 'acting', 'also', 'very', 'solid', 'Willis', 'progressing', 'Cole', 'character', 'very', 'nicely', 'completely', 'lost', 'viewers', 'informed', 'ready', 'action', 'Pitt', 'turning', 'good', 'show', 'manic', 'Goines', 'Stowe', 'portraying', 'straight', 'gal', 'who', 'minds', 'must', 'be', 'convinced', 'really', 'happening.Thus', 'would', 'recommend', '12', 'Monkeys', 'fans', 'science', 'fiction', 'mystery', 'suspense', 'action', 'films', 'ability', 'strike', 'right', 'balance', 'mind-stimulating', 'material', 'utter', 'confusion', 'film', 'can', 'easily', 'be', 'viewed', 'multiple', 'times', 'little', 'tidbits', 'can', 'be', 'picked', 'time']",N/A

Abrams, creater of ""Lost"",""Fringe"" and the new reboot of ""Star Trek"" has put time travel in these three projects and has done a great job. Time-travel can be very complex and confusing but if done right it can make for a great film.""12 Monkeys"" is about convict James Cole (Bruce Willis) who is sent back in time to get information on a deadly virus that wiped out the majority of the human population. When sent back, he is sent back to far in time and ends up in a mental institution where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffery Goines (Brad Pitt). While at the mental institution, Cole tells Dr. Railly that he is from the future and about The 12 monkeys. She like everyone else thinks he is ""nuts"". Cole eventually goes back to the present day.Realizing that Cole was sent back in time to early, his supervisers sent him back again, this time to the correct year. Now, in the correct year, Cole once again runs into Dr. Railly and Jeffery Goines who is the leader/founder of the 12 monkeys. Dr.  Railly remembers him, and realizes after seeing the WWI bullet in his leg that he is indeed from the future and believes him.This may sound confusing to one, but the film does a great job of explaining things.If you like a movie about time-travel, Science fiction or a film that makes you think.
