But however the peace does not last long as a group called Skill out is going around attacking Esper students.  How is the group supposed to stop them when they have something that can affect Espers - including the mighty Railgun, and does one of their own have a connection with the leader of the group.  But of course everything is not all business, swimsuit modelling, festivals, and new friendships will develop - even when a new and more dangerous threat lurks in the shadows, with the missing children being the key to saving or destroying everything they know.I liked this series, a good story with plenty of action and humor thrown in.  The characters really develop well and the story really flowed well.  a good watch",4,Good story - hope for a new season soon,1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,822,"['Shortly', 'Level', 'Upper', 'incident', 'things', 'seem', 'be', 'getting', 'better', 'Academy', 'City', 'however', 'peace', 'not', 'last', 'long', 'group', 'called', 'Skill', 'out', 'going', 'attacking', 'Esper', 'students', 'How', 'group', 'supposed', 'stop', 'when', 'have', 'something', 'can', 'affect', 'Espers', 'including', 'mighty', 'Railgun', 'one', 'own', 'have', 'connection', 'leader', 'group', 'course', 'everything', 'not', 'business', 'swimsuit', 'modelling', 'festivals', 'new', 'friendships', 'will', 'develop', 'even', 'when', 'new', 'more', 'dangerous', 'threat', 'lurks', 'shadows', 'missing', 'children', 'being', 'key', 'saving', 'destroying', 'everything', 'know.I', 'liked', 'series', 'good', 'story', 'plenty', 'action', 'humor', 'thrown', 'characters', 'really', 'develop', 'well', 'story', 'really', 'flowed', 'well', 'good', 'watch']",N/A

As a result 80% of the people living in the city are students there to study and hone their abilities known as esper powers. Like most utopias not all is as it seems and it is up to Mikoto and her friends Kuroko, Kazari and Ruiko to unravel the city&#8217;s secrets and kick some serious butt along the way.While this is a spinoff of another anime series having seen both of them I don&#8217;t feel it isnecessary to have seen &#8220;a certain magical index&#8221; to be able to understand or enjoy this series. At worst you won&#8217;t recognize a few characters from &#8220;a certain magical index&#8221;when they make cameos, but since these characters have nothing to do with this series&#8217; story not recognizing them won&#8217;t diminish your enjoyment of this series one bit.The gorgeous animation, compelling characters, intriguing story and excellent English dub make this series a must own for any anime fan!",5,Excellent a must own!,1391040000,"01 30, 2014",2014,1048,"['Academy', 'City', 'technologically', 'advanced', 'city', 'comprised', 'mostly', 'schools', 'dormitories', 'students', 'attend', 'result', '80', '%', 'people', 'living', 'city', 'are', 'students', 'there', 'study', 'hone', 'abilities', 'known', 'esper', 'powers', 'most', 'utopias', 'not', 'Mikoto', 'friends', 'Kuroko', 'Kazari', 'Ruiko', 'unravel', 'city', '8217', 'secrets', 'kick', 'serious', 'butt', 'way.While', 'spinoff', 'anime', 'series', 'having', 'seen', 'don', '8217', 'feel', 'isnecessary', 'have', 'seen', '8220', 'certain', 'magical', 'index', '8221', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'enjoy', 'series', 'worst', 'won', '8217', 'recognize', 'few', 'characters', '8220', 'certain', 'magical', 'index', '8221', 'when', 'make', 'cameos', 'characters', 'have', 'nothing', 'do', 'series', '8217', 'story', 'not', 'recognizing', 'won', '8217', 'diminish', 'enjoyment', 'series', 'one', 'bit.The', 'gorgeous', 'animation', 'compelling', 'characters', 'intriguing', 'story', 'excellent', 'English', 'dub', 'make', 'series', 'must', 'own', 'anime', 'fan']",N/A

Stick with it and it becomes interesting, though I didn't think it was as interesting as A Certain Magical Index. I collect anime so I had to have this as I own ACMI, I just don't think it's as good.

1621088,AU3YCYN6NHH0,B00B1RB81Q,Norman Wolf,"[1, 8]","The second set of Certain scientific Railgun Season 1 does not include the ova, unfortunately, so it is not a complete season set of Railgun when combined with Set 1. I haven't yet listened to the dub, but the voices are the same as Index Season 1's dub, which I thought was reasonable. Misaki's voice is lacking in emotional depth compared to the original Japanese voice actor, but no major complaints. This is a good series, with plenty of drama, comedy and action, and just a touch of romance. The omission of the ova and dvd/blu-ray specials is the main reason I give this only 4 stars instead of 5. The other reason is the lack of a blu-ray release in North America; Japan released the blu-ray, and it was aired in high definition, so Funimation is just being cheap. It doesn't cost that much more to release a blu-ray instead of a dvd, and Railgun should outsell Index.",4,Incomplete set,1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2013,875,"['second', 'set', 'Certain', 'scientific', 'Railgun', 'Season', '1', 'not', 'include', 'ova', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'complete', 'season', 'set', 'Railgun', 'when', 'combined', 'Set', '1', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'listened', 'dub', 'voices', 'are', 'same', 'Index', 'Season', '1', 'dub', 'thought', 'was', 'reasonable', 'Misaki', 'voice', 'lacking', 'emotional', 'depth', 'compared', 'original', 'Japanese', 'voice', 'actor', 'major', 'complaints', 'good', 'series', 'plenty', 'drama', 'comedy', 'action', 'just', 'touch', 'romance', 'omission', 'ova', 'dvd/blu-ray', 'specials', 'main', 'reason', 'give', 'only', '4', 'stars', 'instead', '5', 'other', 'reason', 'lack', 'blu-ray', 'release', 'North', 'America', 'Japan', 'released', 'blu-ray', 'was', 'aired', 'high', 'definition', 'Funimation', 'just', 'being', 'cheap', ""n't"", 'cost', 'much', 'more', 'release', 'blu-ray', 'instead', 'dvd', 'Railgun', 'should', 'outsell', 'Index']",N/A
1621089,AFV2584U13XP3,B00B1RB81Q,Rich(Anime&Games Will Always Prevail!),"[4, 4]","The second box set shows the follow up an next story arc following the level upper story arc from the first season one box set with a new but pretty generic story plot that interconnects with the previous one as well.  I would advise people to get the first set box as you might get confused somewhat as some of the episodes show integral past scenes or plots from the earlier episodes from before and you will get somewhat lost if you haven't seen them. Like with the first box set these episodes will have a nice intermix of action/comedy/drama/angst but for the most part the drama and angst are kept at a somewhat minimum level no where near series like Gundam Seed,Shiki or Death Note and the like.  The animation is very well done as is the soundtrack and background scenery, the voice cast for both the subbed and dubbed did a terrific job playing their character roles.  Unlike some this series will give a decent closing for fans so you won't feel annoyed or frustrated by some open or vague ending like some other animes. So for fans of Burst Angel,Kiddy Grade,Freezing,Heavens Lost Property and the like then this series is a nice add on to your anime collection or if you like entertaining animes in general another reason to check this series out too.",5,A Nice Conclusion To The Anime Series With A New But Still Generic Story Arc,1365552000,"04 10, 2013",2013,1264,"['second', 'box', 'set', 'follow', 'up', 'next', 'story', 'arc', 'following', 'level', 'upper', 'story', 'arc', 'first', 'season', 'one', 'box', 'set', 'new', 'pretty', 'generic', 'story', 'plot', 'previous', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'would', 'advise', 'people', 'get', 'first', 'set', 'box', 'might', 'get', 'confused', 'somewhat', 'episodes', 'show', 'integral', 'past', 'scenes', 'plots', 'earlier', 'episodes', 'will', 'get', 'somewhat', 'lost', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'first', 'box', 'set', 'episodes', 'will', 'have', 'nice', 'intermix', 'action/comedy/drama/angst', 'most', 'part', 'drama', 'angst', 'are', 'kept', 'somewhat', 'minimum', 'level', 'where', 'near', 'series', 'Gundam', 'Seed', 'Shiki', 'Death', 'Note', 'like', 'animation', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'soundtrack', 'background', 'scenery', 'voice', 'cast', 'subbed', 'dubbed', 'did', 'terrific', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'roles', 'series', 'will', 'give', 'decent', 'closing', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'feel', 'annoyed', 'frustrated', 'open', 'vague', 'ending', 'other', 'animes', 'So', 'fans', 'Burst', 'Angel', 'Kiddy', 'Grade', 'Freezing', 'Lost', 'Property', 'like', 'then', 'series', 'nice', 'add', 'anime', 'collection', 'like', 'entertaining', 'animes', 'general', 'reason', 'check', 'series', 'out', 'too']",N/A
