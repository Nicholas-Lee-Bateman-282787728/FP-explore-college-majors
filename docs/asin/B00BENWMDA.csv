Both of us remember his show very well.Super Star is used now for an actor in one film,one record,etc Plus,a heck of a lot of  ''stars'' are speechless away from a script. Liberace was a natural !  He ad libed fabulously,had a cute personality,and was an instant TV STAR !!I was  born in 1948 and so happy I grew up in the Golden Age of television. We sat in front of that black and white Crosley tv enjoying Lee's outfits and every minute of the show. Everybody adored him, his sexual preference was never uttered. Who cared? 0nce color tv came to my home we were dazzled as if on drugs. Oh you have no idea of the thrillLiberace would use his beautiful smile working the camera playing the best piano we had ever heard. I am glad my neighbor invited me over to see this. For a short t one I was back in the day.back in that Golden Age.Anybody remember Korla Pandit ?

I had hoped for more biography instead of just snippets of different performances. There is waaaaay too much Phyllis Diller. If I wanted to see a huge performance by Diller I'd buy one of her DVDs. I wish now I'd ordered The Legendary Liberace as I know it is a very good film having seen it on t.v. LATER: I'm very disappointed in this DVD. The home movies they promise are silent. I skipped through most of the scenes with other entertainers as they are so boring. The film quality is poor.
