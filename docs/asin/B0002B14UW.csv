I laughed exactly three times, and even those were half-hearted laughs.  I'm thinking perhaps this was not intended for adults...I suppose kids would find the situations funny, but both Cedric and Steve seemed like they were wearing muzzles on their brains.If you liked the Lampoon vacations with Chevy Chase, you'll probably mildly enjoy this.

But it actually isn't. And on top of all that, this movie is pretty funny.Cedric the Entertainer plays Nate Johnson, a man who is trying to drive his son D.J. (Bow Wow), daughters Nikki (Solange Knowles) and Destiny (Gabby Soleil), and (separated) wife Dorothy (Vanessa L. Williams) to the annual Johnson Family Reunion in California. But they somehow end up driving all across unnecessary states (they go from New Mexico to Colorado to Kansas to Missouri) while encountering strange situations -- the strangest of which would have to be hitchhiker Chrishelle (Shannon Elizabeth).The funniest part of the movie to me would have to be when Nate expresses his dismay of D.J.'s CDs, and what Nate in turn does with them. But overall, the movie is great. The only thing I really didn't understand was why Jennifer Freeman had such high billing (she was listed fourth, I think), because she was only in one or two quick scenes, and she didn't even have any speaking parts.

But typically those moments are very few and very far between. Just like this flick.Martin Short and Dana Carvey have learned the hard way - sidekicks typically cannot carry an entire film by themselves. And Cedric The Entertainer is a sidekick.Some performers are just destined for supporting roles. And in truth, from an acting perspective, you actually limit oneself and your career by only seeking out, or worse, demanding the lead roles.Statistically and fiscally, a good sidekick can have a much longer and much richer career. Walter Brennan proved that you can even carve your own niche in Tinseltown if you do your schtick well. I think he went through more than two dozen lead actors. And when most were retired - he kept chugging along. How many paychecks did he cash in when those 'stars' were relegated to a lawn chair and pool side reminiscing about 'back in the day'?If everything truly is cyclical - I hope this new generation of actors produce ones who realize that getting paid on regular basis and having a thirty-to-forty year career is just as important as getting good bill position on the movie poster.As a flick - nothing of merit, nothing of note.

Zwick,"[1, 4]","**1/2In ""Johnson Family Vacation,"" which is little more than an all-black version of the National Lampoon Vacation movies from twenty or so years ago, Nate Johnson loads his wife and three kids into the car and drives from their home in Los Angeles to a family reunion in Missouri.  Along the way, of course, the family meets with a series of comic misadventures that threaten to prevent them from reaching their destination.Despite the derivative storyline, the early scenes in the film exhibit a kind of playful spirit that bodes well for the rest of the movie.  This is due in no small measure to Cedric the Entertainer, who, unlike so many of the comics who appear in these types of movies, doesn't feel the need to stand apart from the material in order to draw attention to himself.  Indeed, it is the laid-back, unfussy way in which he delivers his lines that makes them so funny.  He is also blessed with an attractive supporting cast that includes Vanessa Williams as his long-suffering wife and Bow Wow as his mouthy but generally good-hearted teenage son.  The movie even includes some clever little satirical jabs at the accoutrements and symbols of modern-day black culture as Nate, the traditionalist, who listens to `70`s soul on his worn-out 8-tracks, goes toe-to-toe with his adolescent gansta' rap children.But as the Johnsons tootle their way across country in their souped-up SUV, we begin to notice that the film itself has stalled out.  About halfway through, it dawns on us that the movie isn't really going anywhere, that it is merely playing out variations on incidents we've seen earlier in the film, and that the set pieces and situations aren`t nearly as interesting or outrageous as they should be.

Seems like he was holding back and granted this was a family movie, there could've been more geniunely funny moments in this film besides the simple slapstick which seemed more annoying than funny. As I was sitting in the movie theater I actually tried to force myself to actually like this film. Cedric doubles as his uncle in the film which I thought was just sloppy. There was a clear effort to make sure that both the characters he was playing weren't in the same shot together. I saw better ""doubling"" in a Van Damme movie (i.e. Double Impact). Vanessa Williams role seemed very subdued, another waste of talent in the film but she really wasn't given much to work with here and neither was Steve Harvey. The sad thing about it is, is that I really like these actors and they are capable of so much more than was presented in this movie. It must've been for the paycheck. How else can one explain their signing onto this bad movie. Okay I will say that the movie is somewhat enjoyable but I was really looking forward to seeing a movie that would basically outdue National Lampoon's Vacation.

I was sadly mistaken.  This movie only garnered a few chuckles, but with the Cedric starring in it I really expected to laugh a lot more.  Nate Johnson is trying to prepare for the family trip to see his folks.  He is separated from his wife Dorothy.  To keep up appearances the family goes on the trip, but Nate goes to pick up his new SUV first.  He ends up with this pimped out ride he did not want, but there is no time to get rid of the extras.  Of course his son D. J. is impressed with the new car.Dorothy only lives a block away from her husband.  Once on the road silliness ensues like picking up a strange hitchhiker, letting that hitchhiker have dinner with the family, and then putting her up in a hotel room.  Turns out she is some kind of Satan worshipper who liked to carry a baby alligator.  The car pretty much getting destroyed, and the family ending up in jail.  At the family reunion, the families perform in a talent show to win a trophy, and Nate is determined to show up his brother Mack.  In my family we don't have a talent show per se, but the kids would entertain the grown ups, so I did not find the talent show segment too far fetched.  Cedric doubles as his Uncle in the film, and the Uncle role was more annoying then funny.  Eddie Murphy is the best at pulling off that type of role (Nutty Professor, Coming to America).The one scene I found funny was Nate complaining about the music his son D.J. listens to.  ""Gotta wear a condom to listen to this music.""  Nate then proceeds to toss D.J's Tupac, and Biggie CD's out of the car.  D.J in turn tosses his Nate's old school music out of the window.  This movie I'm sure was easy for Bow Bow, the part was not a stretch for him at all.  The chemistry between Williams and Cedric just was not there.  I really don't think this was the movie for her to be in.  She is much better in Dramas.  The side plot of stalker Stan (Christopher B. Duncan -Jamie Foxx show) was pretty useless.  Shari Headley had such a small part in the movie, you actually forget she starred in this dud.  This is yet another movie I've wasted my time seeing, and won't see again.

The movie is just almost completely devoid of anything funny. Cedric has been funny in other contexts but in this film he is unbelievably bland and restrained. Vanessa Williams is good looking and may even be a good actress but she has the comic skills and timing of a brick.There are some scenes in the film that could possibly have been funny with different actors, writers, and directors, but every attempt at humor in this movie falls flat on its ass. There is no chemistry whatsoever between Williams and Cedric and when Vanessa is trying to act seductively toward Cedric it is just cringe-inducing. Finally, there are so many scenes and ideas ripped off from other movies, especially National Lampoon's Vacation (with Chevy Chase) that it is embarrassing and reminds you how good that movie was and how utterly, deadly dull and stillborn this one is.

His son, (Lil' Bow Wow), now of course thinks of his dad as cool. Estranged from his wife (Vanessa Williams), Nate has convinced her to take a ride to his family reunion along with his teenage boy-crazy daughter (Solange Knowles) and his youngest child (Gabby Soleil). All kinds of funny things happen along the road and family issues begin to come to a head. The reunion is hilarious with Nate and his brother (Steve Harvey) competing for their mother's attention....let the competitions begin!Cedric the Entertainer is very funny in his role as the nerdy insurance selling dad; he is a gifted performer and has the chance to show off all his stuff in this role. Vanessa Williams is still beautiful and amazingly good as the serious Johnson mom. Lil Bow Wow shows he is not all hip-hop in his role as the Johnson son. Solange Knowles is perfectly cast as the teenage Johnson daughter with an eye for the boys. And how sweet is little Gabby Soleil as the youngest Johnson. Of course Steve Harvey cannot be denied as the competitive Johnson brother. The best part of this movie is the talent contest at the reunion where we get to see Cedric in all his glory and Harvey doing a ""Miss Jackson"" routine!
