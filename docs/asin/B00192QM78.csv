Their dance scenes were fun to watch.  The songs were lovely also.  It made me enjoy the movie a lot more.On a different note, the acting was mediocre at times.  Salmon Khan voice sounded faint at times, almost mumbling with his lines. Ali Larter, though she looked beautiful and wore lovely costumes, was IMO, not the right choice for her character.  She seemed out of place in the movie.  Though they tried, their romance seemed forced a little. It wasn't much of a connection to me.  The protrayal of their falling in love, fell a little short.Her dancing was off at times.  I could see missed timings when she danced.  Sometimes it seemed as though she forgot her steps and either rushed it, or was late on her execution.  Salmon's dancing was a little better, but not great. Most of the acting in the movie was just okay.All in all, it was still a fun movie to watch.

This movie was the first time I'd ever seen either one of the two lead characters (Larter and Khan) and I loved them both in their roles.Khan is an incredible dancer and he has the most soulful eyes--the camera truly loves him. His acting was excellent, and I thought he played his role convincingly and was quite romantic. Larter played her role in a convincing manner as well, and I enjoyed watching her undergo a dramatic transformation due to Khan's unwavering love for her.The musical numbers were excellent, with one particularly steamy performance by Larter. There was plenty of comedy, which included poking fun at how Bollywood movies are supposedly made. There was also a lot of beautiful Indian scenery and costumes, which made it a feast for the eyes.I'm loaning this dvd to my daughter, who has never seen a Bollywood movie before.

1161195,AZEBQGWRW9GHC,B00192QM78,Delta,"[0, 0]","Just watched Marigold again - out of respect since it was this movie that sent me deep into Bollywood - OK, I'll be honest , sent me deep into Salman Khan.  So after buying, renting, streaming, watching most of his movies with and without subtitles I decided to go back and look at the hybrid again. It felt constrained. Now, the acting was good and the plot OK...the movie didn't get bogged down but, Salman Khan was so chained up I wondered how he breathed. His usually fantastic wardrobe was ordinary and dancing lackluster although, the one dance number, ""Listen to the Music"" reminded me of Wanted and Ready - that was excellent.I think this was a fair attempt at Hollywood doing Bollywood. If Marigold is your first Bollywood type film, don't stop here - see a few more.  If Salman Kahn is of interest, then you should view Salaam E Ishq & Partner both released the same year as Marigold; in fact,before Marigold.  I guess in Hollywood men don't cry - in Bollywood men don't cry , they weep and there is none of that in Marigold.I thought there were some key elements missing: tears, angst, family drama, dance numbers that moved the story along sorta filling in the blanks. I also did not get a sense of "" when "" things were happening - the editing was a bit too tight- it was today then it was next week. This happened in seconds.Clearly, this movie is not Bollywood, but if you are a first timer, this is a decent teaser. It helps that this movie is in English so no reading subtitles is required. It's not the traditional 2.5 hour movie - this one is just under two hours - 110 minutes - short by Bollywood standards and you don't get an intermission. If you watch Hindi movies you must be prepared to give a good 3 hours...  It's clean - for the family.Sticking to Bollywood tradition - no kissing but lots of hugging ! I didn't know until know how much I missed the shirtless or almost shirtless SK ( it's de'riguer for his movies). But he wears great shirts !

1161203,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00192QM78,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[4, 5]","Director Willard Carroll fell in love with Indian cinema a bit ago, and MARIGOLD is his love letter, his cinematic ode. And much like when Bruce Lee journeyed back to the Far East to make a name for himself, Ali Larter ventures from HEROES to India to star in this uneven fusion of Hollywood's westernized glitter and Bollywood's colorful conventions. You've got to give it up for Ali. It's obvious she put her heart into this. As far as introducing westerners to Hindi films, well, BRIDE & PREJUDICE did it better. I don't know that Salman Khan is the guy to send uninitiated women scurrying to get their hands on Bollywood DVDs.Ali Larter plays a spoiled, vile-tempered American starlet named Marigold Lexton, just flown to Goa to begin shooting her picture KAMA SUTRA 3. From that, it's probably no surprise to learn that Marigold's film oeuvre consists of tepid, low rent sex thrillers such as FATAL ATTRACTION 3 and INDECENT PROPOSAL 2. As someone eventually asks her: ""Have you ever been in a movie without a number after it?"" But when her new film gets shafted, the stranded Marigold promptly finds a new gig, this time as a featured dancer in a Bollywood movie. Except, of course, Marigold Lexton can't dance a lick. Thankfully, the good-looking choreographer, Prem Rajput, exhibits the patience of a buddha, the tolerance of a missionary and the unthreatening charm of a new age musician. Marigold is gradually won over and transitions from being really hateful to this warm and sweet girl (seems like a stretch, I know, but I think Larter pulls it off). Well, you see where this is going...But romance is never so easy. Complications rise up. There's that whole culture clash conundrum. Plus, Marigold already has a boyfriend, the poor sap. And, as it turns out, Prem is keeping a pretty damn significant secret, something which as soon as it's disclosed, our immediate reaction is ""Oh, snap, that is just so Bollywood!"" But there's a reason that one sinister looking guy keeps shadowing him.One interesting aspect has to do with the little peeks we're given concerning the making of a Bollywood film (within a film). I actually sort of buy into the scene when the director tells Marigold, who was asking about her character's motivation, that - and I'm paraphrasing here - the acting bits aren't as relevant as the dancing. In Indian cinema, the musical sequences form the backbone, and they go out of their way to make the numbers into works of sheer extravagance. I think that the women in Hindi films make up some of the most beautiful, most graceful dancers in the world. And Ali Larter, like the character she plays, is in there with them, trying really hard, but she's just, er, choreography challenged. Ali does well with the normal acting sequences. But her limitations as a dancer surface once the music is cued (and, yes, there are musical interludes here, just like in normal Bollywood films). I just don't buy it when Marigold finally gets her act together and dances up such a storm that it bowls everyone over. So credibility takes a bit of a beating. To top it all off, the final 30 minutes feel like the film was scrambling to come up with a finish. In summing up MARIGOLD, let me say that it does have its funny moments and its dramatic and romantic moments. But it also has its fair share of hokeyness, and the musical numbers aren't so memorable.I don't know that Salman Khan, admittedly not one of my favorite guys in Indian cinema, was the ideal choice for the male lead, keeping in mind that he's been a mediocre dancer at best in his other pictures (excepting WANTED; he rocked it in that one). The person I first thought of, when pondering other choices for the part, was Hrithik Roshan. I mean, right?

Ali Larter could not act if her life dependent on it, and she can't dance either or do anything that isn't cringe-worthy in this movie. All her movements in the dance sequence and her lines are mechanical and rehearsed and she tries too hard but still fails miserably on every account. I doubt she was acting really and I think she was seriously miscast for this role anyway.Her character is incredibly unlikeable (hence miscast) and no amount of being nice can change that fundamentally about her. In the beginning it was sort of part of the plot that she was to be mean and b---chy and later she was supposed to soften up and brighten up. But nothing fundamentally changes. Yes she stopped being less caustic, but that's about it. In the movie she plays the typical culturally insensitive, generally not particularly bright, uneducated orange county bimbette with no endearing qualities about her really. She is self absorbed, superficial and conceited. Salman Khan plays the soft-spoken, smart and sensitive guy who  - for odd reasons - falls in love with this vacuous-pet of a woman's soul after 5 minutes and is apparently not the least bit interested in sleeping with her. Yeah right.Everytime they have a conversation it is like a walk down idiot lane cause she is so dumb and uninspired. He is the total opposite but not in a ""opposites-attract"" kind of way but more in a ""what was he thinking"" kind of way. Simnetimes opposites attract and it is riveting to watch the two characters overcome these initial challenges and get closer with sparks flying, but with these two: no sparks - just a few faded noises here and there. Bland and boring, like Ali Larter.Interestingly, Larter plays exactly how Indians view American women and ""Westerners"" in general -  thus perpetuating the stereotype of American girls being dumb, superficial, uneducated, blonde, sex kittens with awesome racks but no charm and otherwise much substance behind them. Terrible.No one seems to have alerted Khan that the movie is a farce, as in work using buffoonery and horseplay and typically including crude characterization and ludicrously improbable situations. He plays his character seriously. Everytime he talks to her, the feel and content of the conversation is as if someone were to ask Lindsey Lohan about an exist strategy out of Iraq. It is really ridiculous.Bttom line: bad story, terrible acting, the two protagonists have no chemistry whatsoever, the dance and music scenes are boring and character development non-existent. And let's not even get into the highly improbably story line. I like Bollywood flicks and I have a big tolerance for cheesy, over-the-top story lines and overacting - as that is just part of the genre - but this was just too much - even for me. This is an empty, pointless, incredibly dumb movie filled with terrible stereotypes about both sides, with bad acting and terrible writing.

Created by Willard Carroll, an American director who said he studied tons of Bollywood movies before making this one, it could be considered a nice introduction to the Bollywood style of movies.The story is straightforward and perhaps predictable, but it is well-told, well-acted, fun, romantic, and has a lot of surprising little pieces of originality sprinkled throughout. (The bar scene between Salman Khan and Marigold's ex-boyfriend alone is worth seeing the movie for!)THE STORYMarigold (Ali Larter) travels to India because she has been signed on to star in yet another B movie. On her arrival, however, she finds that the movie has been canceled, and she is stranded. Through a series of events, she ends up being hired to act in a Bollywood movie in a very small part that gradually grows as her talents start to show. The choreographer (Salman Khan) is taken by her right away, and of course they fall in love. Complications arise when it turns out that he is basically a prince and so might not have the freedom to marry where he wishes. Even more complications arise when her ex-boyfriend shows up to try to win her back. Throughout the movie, we see Marigold's character unfold, like a flower blossoming.WHY I LOVE THIS MOVIEI love this movie in a large part because the people portrayed in it are good. The love story is wonderful, but it isn't just a love story. There isn't a bad guy in the traditional sense, and even the people you might want to (or expect to) dislike are likeable. Each character's good nature and concern for other people simply because they are human beings touched my heart. Also, the songs are well integrated into the movie and some of them have become favorites. (There is also asoundtrack, by the way.)Ali Larter does her own singing and dancing in this movie, and might surprise you with how good she is.If you are a fan of well-done romantic comedies and happy endings, whether or not you have ever seen a Bollywood movie before, please give this movie a try. Also, you might want to try two award-winning Bollywood movies:Monsoon Wedding, which has a bit more serious tone, andDil Chahta Hai, which has a more usual Bollywood running time of just over 3 hours.",4,Fun and romantic!,1269043200,"03 20, 2010",2010,2370,"['American', 'actress', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'perhaps', 'better', 'known', 'roles', 'such', 'inHeroes', 'well-known', 'Bollywood', 'star', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'play', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'Created', 'Willard', 'Carroll', 'American', 'director', 'who', 'said', 'studied', 'tons', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'making', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'considered', 'nice', 'introduction', 'Bollywood', 'style', 'movies.The', 'story', 'straightforward', 'perhaps', 'predictable', 'well-told', 'well-acted', 'fun', 'romantic', 'lot', 'surprising', 'little', 'pieces', 'originality', 'sprinkled', 'bar', 'scene', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'Marigold', 'ex-boyfriend', 'alone', 'worth', 'seeing', 'movie', 'STORYMarigold', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'India', 'been', 'signed', 'star', 'yet', 'B', 'movie', 'arrival', 'however', 'movie', 'been', 'canceled', 'stranded', 'series', 'events', 'up', 'being', 'hired', 'act', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'very', 'small', 'part', 'gradually', 'talents', 'start', 'show', 'choreographer', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'taken', 'right', 'away', 'course', 'fall', 'love', 'Complications', 'arise', 'when', 'out', 'basically', 'prince', 'so', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'freedom', 'marry', 'where', 'Even', 'more', 'complications', 'arise', 'when', 'ex-boyfriend', 'up', 'try', 'win', 'back', 'movie', 'see', 'Marigold', 'character', 'unfold', 'flower', 'blossoming.WHY', 'LOVE', 'THIS', 'MOVIEI', 'love', 'movie', 'large', 'part', 'people', 'portrayed', 'are', 'good', 'love', 'story', 'wonderful', ""n't"", 'just', 'love', 'story', ""n't"", 'bad', 'guy', 'traditional', 'sense', 'even', 'people', 'might', 'want', 'expect', 'dislike', 'are', 'likeable', 'character', 'good', 'nature', 'concern', 'other', 'people', 'simply', 'are', 'human', 'beings', 'touched', 'heart', 'Also', 'songs', 'are', 'well', 'integrated', 'movie', 'have', 'become', 'favorites', 'also', 'asoundtrack', 'way', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'own', 'singing', 'dancing', 'movie', 'might', 'surprise', 'how', 'good', 'is.If', 'are', 'fan', 'well-done', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'happy', 'endings', 'not', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'please', 'give', 'movie', 'try', 'Also', 'might', 'want', 'try', 'two', 'award-winning', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'Monsoon', 'Wedding', 'bit', 'more', 'serious', 'tone', 'andDil', 'Chahta', 'Hai', 'more', 'usual', 'Bollywood', 'running', 'time', 'just', '3', 'hours']",Marigold

There she discovers friendship, work, love and a chance to be her true self.  Her love interest Prem(Salman Khan), a choreographer teaching her to dance, holds secrets of his own, and the story unfolds in typical Bollywood fashion with musical numbers, comedy and romance. Add a few gentle twists and gorgeous, Indian scenery, and you have a very pleasant, although predictable( aren't they all!), romantic comedy.Ali Larter makes no bones about lack of dancing ability which matches her character.  She's done a few obscure movies and lots of TV and modeling(recently seen tastefully attired on a Cosmo cover).  And she does a good job transforming from B-word diva want-to-be to sensitive, vulnerable heroine.  She also sings and learns to dance. In the extras, she comes across very down to earth and sweet in what indeed had to be a most challenging role. Hopefully, we'll see more of her.Her famous Indian co-star, Salman Khan is an amazing and somewhat peculiar sort.  According to Ali, he hardly rehearses, learns the dance steps lickety-split, and he's a bit difficult to work with.  I think his low toned, suave voice would suit radio perfectly.  I love the secondary actors best for their comedy.  Their sense of timing along with that accent always cracks me up.American director Willard Carroll who studied tons of Bollywood flicks puts it together nicely.  The 'Making of Marigold' in the extras sums it up in a fascinating display of cultural clashes and glitches: like trying to film at the Taj Mahal, piece mealing the extravagant, musical numbers together, shooting on location and avoiding mob scenes and overall, trying to present an American tolerable movie that's still reflects the Bollywood/Kollywood/whatever format.If you're into true Bollywood, this movie will probably annoy you; otherwise, enjoy a musical, romantic romp along with a tour through a mystical land.",4,Bollywood light- Western style,1231459200,"01 9, 2009",2009,2189,"['not', 'sure', 'Bollywood', 'kind', 'crazy', 'perky', 'jump', 'song', 'dance', 'Indian', 'movies', 'seem', 'run', 'forever', 'might', 'be', 'good', 'intro', 'least', 'more', 'palatable', 'choice.Synopsis', 'barely', 'B-movie', 'grade', 'unhappy', 'crass', 'American', 'actress', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'stranded', 'India', 'friendship', 'work', 'love', 'chance', 'be', 'true', 'self', 'love', 'interest', 'Prem', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'choreographer', 'teaching', 'dance', 'secrets', 'own', 'story', 'unfolds', 'typical', 'Bollywood', 'fashion', 'musical', 'numbers', 'comedy', 'romance', 'Add', 'few', 'gentle', 'twists', 'gorgeous', 'Indian', 'scenery', 'have', 'very', 'pleasant', 'predictable', 'are', ""n't"", 'romantic', 'comedy.Ali', 'Larter', 'bones', 'lack', 'dancing', 'ability', 'character', 'done', 'few', 'obscure', 'movies', 'lots', 'TV', 'modeling', 'recently', 'seen', 'tastefully', 'attired', 'Cosmo', 'cover', 'good', 'job', 'transforming', 'B-word', 'diva', 'want-to-be', 'sensitive', 'vulnerable', 'heroine', 'also', 'sings', 'learns', 'dance', 'extras', 'very', 'down', 'earth', 'sweet', 'what', 'indeed', 'had', 'be', 'most', 'challenging', 'role', 'Hopefully', ""'ll"", 'see', 'more', 'her.Her', 'famous', 'Indian', 'co-star', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'amazing', 'somewhat', 'peculiar', 'sort', 'According', 'Ali', 'hardly', 'dance', 'lickety-split', 'bit', 'difficult', 'work', 'think', 'low', 'toned', 'suave', 'voice', 'would', 'suit', 'radio', 'perfectly', 'love', 'secondary', 'actors', 'best', 'comedy', 'sense', 'timing', 'along', 'accent', 'always', 'up.American', 'director', 'Willard', 'Carroll', 'who', 'studied', 'tons', 'Bollywood', 'flicks', 'together', 'nicely', ""'Making"", 'Marigold', 'extras', 'sums', 'up', 'fascinating', 'display', 'cultural', 'clashes', 'glitches', 'trying', 'film', 'Taj', 'Mahal', 'piece', 'mealing', 'extravagant', 'musical', 'numbers', 'together', 'shooting', 'location', 'avoiding', 'mob', 'scenes', 'overall', 'trying', 'present', 'American', 'tolerable', 'movie', 'still', 'Bollywood/Kollywood/whatever', 'format.If', ""'re"", 'true', 'Bollywood', 'movie', 'will', 'probably', 'annoy', 'otherwise', 'enjoy', 'musical', 'romantic', 'romp', 'tour', 'mystical', 'land']",Marigold

I watch a lot of Bollywood and at 110 mins it's too short for a real Bollywood movie. The plot structure is American, shorter and tighter as a result.

A prima donna, she alienates nearly everyone on the way to India, only to find upon arriving that her film has lost its funding. More or less marooned, she manages to find herself on the set of a Bollywood film observing. There, she meets one of its stars (played by Bollywood star Salman Khan), and the two begin to fall in love as Marigold is cast in the film in a minor role that gradually grows with her relationship.Marigold (the film, not the character) is a western homage to Bollywood films and is clearly made with love while retaining its western roots. There are musical numbers, of course, but they are within the context of the fictional Bollywood film. The cast is almost entirely Indian, and the music is a fusion of Indian (with Hindi lyrics) and western.

This DVD has no sub-titles (not required) and is only 107 minutes (short by Bollywood standards).Marigold the movie was a fresh experience for me, and got me hooked on pure Bollywood movies (I lean towards the traditional type Bollywood musical movie - the color, music, many beautiful women dancing, and ""typically"" intense love stories that don't rely on physical/naked love scenes).Ali Larter is great in Marigold (the lead actress), who's Character undergoes a significant personality transformation due to her exposure to people in India (the first 15 minutes of the movie are kind of harsh because she plays a spoiled actress to the hilt, but she won me over 'big time' in the remaining events).  Salman Khan (the lead actor) is a very successful Indian actor, who plays his part low key in this film.There are several good dance scenes with good music, but this is not a typical American musical so be prepared for a difference.  Ali Larter might not be a great dancer, but for the Character she played (who admits during the movie that ""I can't dance"") I thought she did fine.The DVD picture quality is mostly good, and is fun to watch (there are some short `Bonus Material' items too, like an interesting/ revealing interview with Ali Larter that unfortunately is very low quality video footage).",5,Good crossover / hybrid Bollywood,1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,1662,"['Marigold', 'was', 'movie', 'got', 'interested', 'Bollywood', 'just', 'luck', 'saw', 'Blockbuster', 'store', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'took', 'chance', '.Since', 'was', 'primarily', 'made', 'Hollywood', 'crew', 'majority', 'Indian', 'actors', 'speaking', 'English', '95', '%', 'time', 'shot', 'India', 'easy/enjoyable', 'intro', 'Bollywood', 'type', 'movies', 'English', 'speaking', 'audiences', 'DVD', 'sub-titles', 'not', 'required', 'only', '107', 'minutes', 'short', 'Bollywood', 'standards', '.Marigold', 'movie', 'was', 'fresh', 'experience', 'got', 'hooked', 'pure', 'Bollywood', 'movies', 'lean', 'traditional', 'type', 'Bollywood', 'musical', 'movie', 'color', 'music', 'many', 'beautiful', 'women', 'dancing', 'typically', 'intense', 'love', 'stories', 'do', ""n't"", 'rely', 'physical/naked', 'love', 'scenes', '.Ali', 'Larter', 'great', 'Marigold', 'lead', 'actress', 'who', 'Character', 'significant', 'personality', 'transformation', 'due', 'exposure', 'people', 'India', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'movie', 'are', 'kind', 'harsh', 'spoiled', 'actress', 'hilt', 'won', ""'big"", 'time', 'remaining', 'events', 'Salman', 'Khan', 'lead', 'actor', 'very', 'successful', 'Indian', 'actor', 'who', 'part', 'low', 'key', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'dance', 'scenes', 'good', 'music', 'not', 'typical', 'American', 'musical', 'so', 'be', 'prepared', 'difference', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'great', 'dancer', 'Character', 'played', 'who', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dance', 'thought', 'did', 'fine.The', 'DVD', 'picture', 'quality', 'mostly', 'good', 'fun', 'watch', 'are', 'short', 'Bonus', 'Material', 'items', 'too', 'interesting/', 'revealing', 'interview', 'Ali', 'Larter', 'unfortunately', 'very', 'low', 'quality', 'video', 'footage']",Marigold

Since it arrived from Amazon I've leant it many times. When I recommend a real Indian thing I often get very emotional responses in fact more childish than whatever they found to criticize in the film. True and funny. Devdas generally sets people wildly off. But this they can enjoy and dismiss. Ali's transformation from hard westerner to a semi blissful state after being in India only a short time is very believable. India has that effect as does Hawaii. She glows with love and smiles from some inner light that makes her very beautiful. Salmon Khan is pure charm a true Indian heart-throb matinee idol. The comedy of crossed lovers approaching the alter of tradition and prescribed marriage stirs the pot and resolves in a happy ending. Reminiscent of the Indian maxim painted in both English & Hindhi  on walls & structures across India ""others before self"". The antithesis of western ideals it readily comes off beautifully in this film.  The dancing and music is good. I have seen both much worse and much better done in Bollywood movies.
