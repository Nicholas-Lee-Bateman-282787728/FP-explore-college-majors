My 5 year old grandson said it was &#34;fine&#34; but his 10 year old sister left after the first 5 minutes.  I left it on only because my grandson wanted to see how it ended.  At one time, many years ago, this film might have earned the high rating shown on Amazon, but I'm not sure I would have liked it even then.",2,boring movie,1392681600,"02 18, 2014",2014,375,"['found', 'filming', 'be', 'antiquated', 'film', 'boring', '5', 'year', 'old', 'grandson', 'said', 'was', '34', 'fine', '34', '10', 'year', 'old', 'sister', 'left', 'first', '5', 'minutes', 'left', 'only', 'grandson', 'wanted', 'see', 'how', 'ended', 'one', 'time', 'many', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'might', 'have', 'earned', 'high', 'rating', 'shown', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'even', 'then']",N/A

A lovely, gentle fantasy that, which was rare in the 1940s, encourages the preservation of the forests.  Would be a great companion piece to Bambi.  I bought the Mr. Fat-W Video version.  I don't know if it's been remastered, but it's adequate.  The picture quality is OK and the color is nice.  It would be nice to see the Image Entertainment version re-released though.  Lovely movie for young children that haven't been glutted by today's overwhelming films.
