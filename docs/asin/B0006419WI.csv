It includes two dvds, the first is the live concert it's self, the second is nothing but extras.  One thing I like on disc 2 is the music video for ""I Can Only Imagine.""  So, long story short buy this dvd.",5,Great DVD,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,284,"['Awesome', 'DVD', 'fan', 'Mercy', 'Me', 'not', 'will', 'love', 'two', 'dvds', 'first', 'live', 'concert', 'second', 'nothing', 'extras', 'One', 'thing', 'like', 'disc', '2', 'music', 'video', 'Can', 'Only', 'Imagine', 'So', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'buy', 'dvd']",N/A

858388,A30BCRSABL9AYI,B0006419WI,Music Lover,"[16, 17]","I bought the live cd and dvd mainly because I like MercyMe's music and thought it'd be cool to have something new to listen to.  Generally speaking live cd's are so-so as the music is what you know but generally a little different since it's live.  The sound quality is usually not quite what you'd like and the concert footage generally ends up being watching the singer dance around on stage.  Thankfully, there is nothing general about this live cd or dvd.  The cd's music quality is wonderful and the great stage presence comes across.  It's fun to listen to as well as Bart (lead singer) explains a few of the songs and even the story of how they got their name which is hilarious (I won't spoil it for anyone - get this and find out for yourself).  The DVD is also great as you see more of the stage presence and what goes on behind the scenes in preparing for a concert tour as a whole and each individual concert.  On the dvd you also get the story of how they got their name as well as extended explanations into songs such as ""Imagine"" and ""Home Sick"".  Again, I'm not going to spoil anything but the stories of ""Imagine"" and ""Home sick"" brought a new appreciation of those particular songs.  Overall, the concert that they show looks it was a blast to be at and the music was wonderful.  I'll definitely be buying tickets to see them in concert when they come near here in the future.",5,Much better than I anticipated,1110240000,"03 8, 2005",2005,1395,"['bought', 'live', 'cd', 'dvd', 'mainly', 'like', 'MercyMe', 'music', 'thought', ""'d"", 'be', 'cool', 'have', 'something', 'new', 'listen', 'Generally', 'speaking', 'live', 'cd', 'are', 'so-so', 'music', 'what', 'know', 'generally', 'little', 'different', 'live', 'sound', 'quality', 'usually', 'not', 'quite', 'what', ""'d"", 'like', 'concert', 'footage', 'generally', 'up', 'being', 'watching', 'singer', 'dance', 'stage', 'Thankfully', 'nothing', 'general', 'live', 'cd', 'dvd', 'cd', 'music', 'quality', 'wonderful', 'great', 'stage', 'presence', 'fun', 'listen', 'as', 'well', 'Bart', 'lead', 'singer', 'few', 'songs', 'even', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'name', 'hilarious', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'anyone', 'get', 'find', 'out', 'DVD', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'more', 'stage', 'presence', 'what', 'scenes', 'preparing', 'concert', 'tour', 'whole', 'individual', 'concert', 'dvd', 'also', 'get', 'story', 'how', 'got', 'name', 'as', 'well', 'extended', 'explanations', 'songs', 'such', 'Imagine', 'Home', 'Sick', 'Again', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'spoil', 'anything', 'stories', 'Imagine', 'Home', 'sick', 'brought', 'new', 'appreciation', 'particular', 'songs', 'Overall', 'concert', 'show', 'was', 'blast', 'be', 'music', 'was', 'wonderful', ""'ll"", 'definitely', 'be', 'buying', 'tickets', 'see', 'concert', 'when', 'come', 'here', 'future']",N/A

One big problem; the DVD will not produce 5.1 surround. It has the setup menu and declares that it is DD 5.1 on the case but when it goes to play it reverts to standard stereo. Same result on multiple players. So don't expect great sound if you have a high-end sound system.",3,DVD Problem,1171152000,"02 11, 2007",2007,372,"['concert', 'was', 'good', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'continuity', 'disrupted', 'unfortunate', 'edits', 'One', 'big', 'problem', 'DVD', 'will', 'not', 'produce', '5.1', 'surround', 'setup', 'menu', 'DD', '5.1', 'case', 'when', 'play', 'standard', 'stereo', 'Same', 'result', 'multiple', 'players', 'So', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'great', 'sound', 'have', 'high-end', 'sound', 'system']",N/A
