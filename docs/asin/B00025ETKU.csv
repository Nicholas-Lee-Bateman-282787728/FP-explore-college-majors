At ALL. Of course, I bought this to see how well the 60+ y/o Stones were holding out (and they did very, very well, thank you...and thank The Lord for Charlie Watts!), I honestly have to say that The Isley Brothers, for my money, stole the show.  Ernie Isley is EVERY bit as good as that guy from Seattle that died about 30 years ago, and seeing &quot;that lady&quot; on &quot;Who's That Lady...&quot; WHEW! The blegh parts of the show are the &quot;Flming Lips&quot; or whatever they call themselves, that open the show; Dan Ackroyd STILL milking the Blues Bothers schtick with Goober Belushi and a horrid Blues Bros band knockoff; Justin Timberlake is another individual that I resent very deeply, him consuming air that David Allen Coe or somebody could put to better use, BUT it is quite pleasurable seeing the fans throw stuff at him with he's prancing aound with Mick during &quot;Miss You&quot;; and Geddy Lee is, as ever, painful to the ears, but it was kinda neat, Alexwhatisname doing that pretty good instrumental of &quot;Paint It Black&quot;;  and it was a great treat seeing/hearing Angus Young jam with the Stones.

825001,A2JLSHTST2SP1I,B00025ETKU,Danno,"[4, 5]","In 2003, Toronto's tourism industry was crippled by exaggerated reports that the disease SARS was running rampant. To lure tourist dollars back into the city and prove that all was safe as milk, several major classic rock bands agreed to appear at the reasonably priced music festival. This DVD contains roughly two hours of highlights from that 12 hour festival.The DVD isn't perfect. Dan Ackroyd is the show's emcee and he unfortunately dusts off his tired ""Blues Brothers"" schtick one too many times. (Yes, I know neither he nor Jim Belushi don shades or cheap suits but that has more to do with the concert being held at the end of a very hot July). Sheesh, where's Mike Myers when you need him? Absolutely nothing accounts for Justin Timberlake's presence; even if Timberlake were a competant performer - which he isn't - this Canadian crowd is solidly in the classic rock camp and wouldn't be interested anyway. Also, considering this is a Canadian show, comparatively few of the Canadian acts that appeared on the bill are also on the DVD.However, the bulk of the concert is definitely enjoyable. The Flaming Lips are as goofily surreal as ever. The Isley Brothers provide some much-needed grit to the proceedings, and give us a chance to watch Ernie Isley chew up the stage with his Jimi Hendrix paraphrasings. The Guess Who's reunion is rather bloated but treats us to an excellent live version of ""No Time."" Rush are a sheer joy, blasting through relatively straightforward versions of ""Free Will"" and ""Spirit of the Radio."" It's some of the best live Rush recorded in the past few years. AC/DC get fairly limited screen time (and Angus Young's guitar isn't mixed loud enough) but it's exciting seeing these Aussies rile up the crowd for the main attraction. The Rolling Stones get most of the time on this DVD, and provide us with what we expect from latter-day Rolling Stones. The Stones take every stage they perform on as though they own it and if the set list isn't as imaginative as you'd like, you still have to acknowledge that the Stones have become the most consistently professional and dependable of their peers. Besides, Keith Richards swaggers around as though he's having the time of his life here. The only downside? Timberlake duets with Jagger on ""Miss You."" Ugh.Given the price and the sheer variety of artists here, the DVD is an excellent purchase if you're looking for a classic rock sampler. Used copies of this 2003 concert can be easily found, adding to the bargain. This can't compare in historical significance to either Woodstock or Live Aid, but it's one heck of an entertaining show to watch.",4,Decent concert compliation at a good price,1135209600,"12 22, 2005",2005,2632,"['2003', 'Toronto', 'tourism', 'industry', 'was', 'crippled', 'exaggerated', 'reports', 'disease', 'SARS', 'was', 'running', 'rampant', 'lure', 'tourist', 'dollars', 'back', 'city', 'prove', 'was', 'safe', 'milk', 'several', 'major', 'classic', 'rock', 'bands', 'agreed', 'appear', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'music', 'festival', 'DVD', 'roughly', 'two', 'hours', 'highlights', '12', 'hour', 'festival.The', 'DVD', ""n't"", 'perfect', 'Dan', 'Ackroyd', 'show', 'emcee', 'unfortunately', 'tired', 'Blues', 'Brothers', 'schtick', 'one', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'Yes', 'know', 'neither', 'Jim', 'Belushi', 'shades', 'cheap', 'suits', 'more', 'do', 'concert', 'being', 'held', 'end', 'very', 'hot', 'July', 'Sheesh', 'where', 'Mike', 'Myers', 'when', 'need', 'Absolutely', 'nothing', 'accounts', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'presence', 'even', 'Timberlake', 'were', 'competant', 'performer', ""n't"", 'Canadian', 'crowd', 'solidly', 'classic', 'rock', 'camp', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'interested', 'anyway', 'Also', 'considering', 'Canadian', 'show', 'comparatively', 'few', 'Canadian', 'acts', 'appeared', 'bill', 'are', 'also', 'DVD.However', 'bulk', 'concert', 'definitely', 'enjoyable', 'Flaming', 'Lips', 'are', 'goofily', 'surreal', 'ever', 'Isley', 'Brothers', 'provide', 'much-needed', 'grit', 'proceedings', 'give', 'chance', 'watch', 'Ernie', 'Isley', 'chew', 'up', 'stage', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'paraphrasings', 'Guess', 'Who', 'reunion', 'rather', 'bloated', 'excellent', 'live', 'version', 'Time', 'Rush', 'are', 'sheer', 'joy', 'blasting', 'relatively', 'straightforward', 'versions', 'Free', 'Will', 'Spirit', 'Radio', 'best', 'live', 'Rush', 'recorded', 'past', 'few', 'years', 'AC/DC', 'get', 'fairly', 'limited', 'screen', 'time', 'Angus', 'Young', 'guitar', ""n't"", 'mixed', 'loud', 'enough', 'exciting', 'seeing', 'Aussies', 'rile', 'up', 'crowd', 'main', 'attraction', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'get', 'most', 'time', 'DVD', 'provide', 'what', 'expect', 'latter-day', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'Stones', 'take', 'stage', 'perform', 'own', 'set', 'list', ""n't"", 'as', 'imaginative', ""'d"", 'like', 'still', 'have', 'acknowledge', 'Stones', 'have', 'become', 'most', 'consistently', 'professional', 'dependable', 'peers', 'Besides', 'Keith', 'Richards', 'swaggers', 'around', 'having', 'time', 'life', 'here', 'only', 'downside', 'Timberlake', 'duets', 'Jagger', 'Miss', 'price', 'sheer', 'variety', 'artists', 'here', 'DVD', 'excellent', 'purchase', ""'re"", 'looking', 'classic', 'rock', 'sampler', 'Used', 'copies', '2003', 'concert', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'found', 'adding', 'bargain', 'ca', ""n't"", 'compare', 'historical', 'significance', 'Woodstock', 'Live', 'Aid', 'one', 'heck', 'entertaining', 'show', 'watch']",N/A
825002,AMCNC5VLHARW9,B00025ETKU,"James Baack ""I'm Mad, Bad and Dangerous To Know!""","[10, 10]","This is a great DVD that should be on a priority list for all Stones and AC/DC fans.The great thing about this is the pure rawness of The Rolling Stones performance. I'll explain. I feel for too long the Stones on stage have been so polished and professional that its lost a little of the excitement. The feeling that I got from this is that they plugged in and let it kick. When Justin Timberlake performs ""Miss You"" with Mick and disappoving fans show their angnst by throwing bottles on stage, Keith stops playing and confronts them during the performance.That was a beautiful throwback (if only for a moment) to ""Gimme Shelter Glory Days"".When Angus and Malcom Young of AC/DC join the Stones on stage for ""Rock Me Baby"" the atmosphere is filled with  pure magic. The chemistry and the way their playing complements each other brings chills.I'm not sure why Justin Timberlake was included with the line up. This is a Rock and Roll Show- The fans were there to rock, not see an ex-member of a ""boy band"". I actually felt a little sorry for Justin, but it was clearly not his fault. That type of mix was too extreme for 490,000 people standing in the hot July sun drinking lots of beer and ready to feel power chords in their gut.The extras are great too- its fun watching AC/DC and the Stones get along like old friends and possibly offer a glimpse of a North American tour maybe someday together.If you are a Rolling Stones or AC/DC fan as I am, Take it from me, If you do not own this already,- Get it Today!....Hurry!",5,A  Must for any AC/DC or Stones Fan.,1111276800,"03 20, 2005",2005,1522,"['great', 'DVD', 'should', 'be', 'priority', 'list', 'Stones', 'AC/DC', 'fans.The', 'great', 'thing', 'pure', 'rawness', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'performance', ""'ll"", 'explain', 'feel', 'too', 'long', 'Stones', 'stage', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'polished', 'professional', 'lost', 'little', 'excitement', 'feeling', 'got', 'plugged', 'let', 'kick', 'When', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'Miss', 'Mick', 'disappoving', 'fans', 'show', 'angnst', 'throwing', 'bottles', 'stage', 'Keith', 'playing', 'confronts', 'performance.That', 'was', 'beautiful', 'throwback', 'only', 'moment', 'Gim', 'Shelter', 'Glory', 'Days', '.When', 'Angus', 'Malcom', 'Young', 'AC/DC', 'join', 'Stones', 'stage', 'Rock', 'Me', 'Baby', 'atmosphere', 'filled', 'pure', 'magic', 'chemistry', 'way', 'playing', 'complements', 'other', 'brings', 'chills.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'was', 'included', 'line', 'up', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Show-', 'fans', 'were', 'there', 'rock', 'not', 'see', 'ex-member', 'boy', 'band', 'actually', 'felt', 'little', 'sorry', 'Justin', 'was', 'clearly', 'not', 'fault', 'type', 'mix', 'was', 'too', 'extreme', '490,000', 'people', 'standing', 'hot', 'July', 'sun', 'drinking', 'lots', 'beer', 'ready', 'feel', 'power', 'chords', 'gut.The', 'extras', 'are', 'great', 'too-', 'fun', 'watching', 'AC/DC', 'Stones', 'get', 'like', 'old', 'friends', 'possibly', 'offer', 'glimpse', 'North', 'American', 'tour', 'maybe', 'someday', 'are', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'AC/DC', 'fan', 'am', 'Take', 'do', 'not', 'own', 'already', 'Get', 'Today', '.Hurry']",N/A
825003,A1P2NBM3P3TS2X,B00025ETKU,"John S. Harris ""The Voice of Reason""","[33, 36]",".....as one would expect. This DVD is a much pared-down version of an all-day concert event. The meat of the show was Rush, AC/DC, The Guess Who, and the Rolling Stones. How Justin Timberlake got invited to this is anybody's guess. I don't know who thought that a rock and roll crowd would be willing to sit still and behave during a boy-band alum's teeny-bopper Pop set. Just a bad decision. A real buzzkill in that kind of music line-up. Imagine watching Rush and The Guess Who perform, then, while frothing at the mouth waiting for AC/DC and the Stones to perform, you have to sit through a set by an N*SYNC member. Whose lame idea of musical continuity was that?? Audience members were booing and pelting Timberlake with water bottles. To make matters worse, Timberlake joined the Stones onstage during &quot;Miss You&quot;. And he looked absolutely ridiculous. Mick is up there gyrating as usual, and Timberlake is trying his best to look cool, but he looks like someone doing a lame attempt at dancing like a hip-hop artist.I'm sorry, but if bubble-gum Pop and Rock and Roll don't belong in the same concert line-up, the CERTAINLY don't belong on the same stage at the SAME TIME!My favorite part of the DVD was the camera work during Rush's brief set. I've been watching the &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; DVD quite a bit lately, and loving every second of it. But for some reason the camera work on Rush in this DVD is more approachable and accessible. You feel like you are there with them. That probably has something to do with the light - it is broad daylight during Rush's set. You'll have to see it to see what I mean. And the camera angles on drummer Neil Peart (who looks simply delighted when he meets Charlie Watts - as shown in the documentary footage) are more inviting and satisfying. You can't help but love watching Neil pound those skins!There is a lot of fluff in this DVD presentation (Timberlake and the Aykroyd/Belushi segments), but the Rush, AC/DC, and Timberlake-less Stones more than make up for it.",4,"Good show, but Timberlake embarrasses himself",1091750400,"08 6, 2004",2004,2023,"['..as', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'DVD', 'much', 'pared-down', 'version', 'all-day', 'concert', 'event', 'meat', 'show', 'was', 'Rush', 'AC/DC', 'Guess', 'Who', 'Rolling', 'Stones', 'How', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'got', 'invited', 'anybody', 'guess', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'who', 'thought', 'rock', 'roll', 'crowd', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'sit', 'still', 'behave', 'boy-band', 'alum', 'teeny-bopper', 'Pop', 'set', 'Just', 'bad', 'decision', 'real', 'buzzkill', 'kind', 'music', 'line-up', 'Imagine', 'watching', 'Rush', 'Guess', 'Who', 'perform', 'then', 'frothing', 'mouth', 'waiting', 'AC/DC', 'Stones', 'perform', 'have', 'sit', 'set', 'N*SYNC', 'member', 'Whose', 'lame', 'idea', 'musical', 'continuity', 'was', 'Audience', 'members', 'were', 'booing', 'pelting', 'Timberlake', 'water', 'bottles', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'Timberlake', 'joined', 'Stones', 'onstage', 'quot', 'Miss', 'quot', 'looked', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'Mick', 'there', 'gyrating', 'usual', 'Timberlake', 'trying', 'best', 'look', 'cool', 'someone', 'doing', 'lame', 'attempt', 'dancing', 'hip-hop', 'artist.I', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'bubble-gum', 'Pop', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'same', 'concert', 'line-up', 'CERTAINLY', 'do', ""n't"", 'belong', 'same', 'stage', 'SAME', 'TIME', 'favorite', 'part', 'DVD', 'was', 'camera', 'work', 'Rush', 'brief', 'set', ""'ve"", 'been', 'watching', 'quot', 'Rush', 'Rio', 'quot', 'DVD', 'quite', 'bit', 'lately', 'loving', 'second', 'reason', 'camera', 'work', 'Rush', 'DVD', 'more', 'approachable', 'accessible', 'feel', 'are', 'there', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'light', 'broad', 'daylight', 'Rush', 'set', ""'ll"", 'have', 'see', 'see', 'what', 'mean', 'camera', 'drummer', 'Neil', 'Peart', 'who', 'simply', 'delighted', 'when', 'Charlie', 'Watts', 'shown', 'documentary', 'footage', 'are', 'more', 'inviting', 'satisfying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'love', 'watching', 'Neil', 'pound', 'skins', 'lot', 'fluff', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'Timberlake', 'Aykroyd/Belushi', 'segments', 'Rush', 'AC/DC', 'Timberlake-less', 'Stones', 'more', 'make', 'up']",N/A

Do you seriously not know the difference between The Who and The Guess Who?  You poor soul.  'American Woman' believe it or not, was not originally a Lenny Kravitz song.

Because if you knew anything about The Who, you would know that Randy Bachman, and Burton Cummings are not in The Who.  I suggest you remove yourself from the rock under which you must be living.  I'm a 17 year old girl, and I know who the Guess Who are.  I grew up on them.  Go buy a Guess Who Greatest Hits album and educate yourself.Now on to my review of the DVD.
