Although this is not classified as a comedy, the Duke's turns in a sly performance full of great one-liners and facial expressions that had me rolling. Its action adventure in the oil fields and it's very entertaining and fun. Wayne is Cowboy Dan Somers and he competes with oilman Jim Gardner for oil lease rights on Indian land in Oklahoma, as well as for the favors of schoolteacher Cathy Allen. It has a good supporting cast including George &quot;Gabby&quot; Hayes.You will never see the Duke quite like this in any other role. If you're a fan of the Duke, this film is a must so track down a copy while you can.
