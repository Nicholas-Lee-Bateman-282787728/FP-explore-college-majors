KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[1, 1]","After watching a ton of Disney Treasure sets, this second collection of Ub Iwerks early cartoons may not be of the same quality as his efforts with Disney, but they are certainly worth the time of any animation history buff. At a bargain price, this set features 26 cartoons and for the most part they look very good, with most of the wear being at the beginning of each short during titles and the first 30 seconds or so of the shorts. Have they been remastered? .....probably not, but besides a little wear here and there, they are presented uncut and look pretty clear and not washed out. The only exception is to Hell's Fire which has a caption before the cartoon starts that states :these are the last remaining fragments of the cartoon that have survived"". This cartoon runs well over 5 minutes, so I can't imagine too much is missing....at least they included what has survived and they don't try to pass it off as a complete short.Like the first set, this one volume two still has the basic menu with my only gripe, the menu could have used a little work to make it a little more user friendly. You can play all the cartoons or look at the scene selection for individual titles, but once you start the cartoon from any point, it will play all from that point. Meaning you have to stop after each cartoon and go to the menu if you want to skip around and see selected shorts. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been easily fixed with a few adjustments.Is it worth buying, absolutely! it has 26 rare shorts that may never look any better or be released again. At a tad under $10.00(or cheaper if you look around), you get a nice collection of cartoons from a man who was a pioneer in animation.

How could balloon people defend themselves against a Pincushion man? The situation seemed hopeless. So how did they do it? They made a sticky dough which they threw at the Pincushion man until he got so stuck together that he just rolled away in a huge ball of dough. All the balloons piched in, some making dough, some manning the machines that threw the dough. They had a warning system that was sounded when the Pincushion man appeared.
