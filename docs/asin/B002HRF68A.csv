That's understandable, if you're looking for more of an action movie type of experience.  It does drag a bit in spots, especially at the beginning.But action sequences are not really the point behind ""The Plan."" The outline of the story is already well-known to anyone who has seen the series, so it's hard to generate a lot of suspense.  Instead, the producers decided to retell the story from the Cylon's perspective and give the audience a little more insight into Cylon psychology.This change of focus allows the video to explore what makes the different models and individual copies of the models tick and how personal experiences shape them.  Boomer, the Simons (who were woefully neglected in the series) and the Cavils get particular attention.  Even though some of the plot gaps get filled in (Sam and the Resistance on Caprica and how Ellen got off Picon, for example), the narrative is secondary to the nuances of character exploration.One of the ongoing themes of BSG was what it means to be human.

1268763,AMIGVTZZIWS6I,B002HRF68A,Amazon Customer,"[1, 2]","I was eagerly awaiting the release of Battlestar Galactica: The Plan.  Unfortuantely, The Plan is a rather disapppointing film.  What we were promised was a view of the attack on humanity from the Cylon point of view, which is a very interesting idea with potential for great storytelling.  Unfortuately, all we really got was a glorified clip show that would be better suited for the deleted scenes section of a DVD.  Hell, we don't even get all the Cylon models; Number Three is absent from the film altogether.  Maybe Lucy Lawless had better things to do or maybe Syfy was trying to save money.  Regardless of the reason, the movie was lacking something without her presence.Of course, The Plan does have some fine moments.  In particular, the character of Cavil really shines through -- even more so than he did during the series run.  Dean Stockwell owns this character in every way.  It was always odd for me to see the guy who played the comedic character of Al in Quantum Leap take on the role Number One.  Stockwell was given a truly unrepentent charcter and made him a joy to watch for that very reason.Overall, The Plan did not live up to my expectations.

1268764,AQUVTQFFXP4AC,B002HRF68A,"Andariel Halo ""Disillusioned Smark""","[1, 1]","It's simple as that.  You'd think, given much of what happened in the series and from Cavil himselves, this would be obvious enough.But given the immense amount of mystery, intrigue, and emphasis placed on the whole ""AND THEY HAVE A PLAN"" bit, I'd expect it to match what the series was giving us in heaping doses---pseudo-religious, mythical, spiritual, perhaps even psychological motivations for the attack on Humanity.  Perhaps something as grandiose as ""The Cylons did not WANT to attack humanity, but God ordered the Cylons to destroy humanity (as per the mythology of the Flood) and test the survivors to prove their worth""Nope.  ""Kill all Humans"".  That's it.  The Cavils pretty much make this fact non-negotiable.Without going into spoilers, I'll point this out: Cavil's PLAN with the Galactica and the surviving Colonial Fleet is literally cartoonish in its plotting and execution.  Cavil CONSTANTLY whines and complains and bitches about the Fleet surviving the attack, yet he NEVER just outright destroys the fleet.Obviously the Cylon fleet cannot catch up with the Colonials, and the Cylons on board the Galactica cannot contact the Cylon fleet directly, but there's so many ways they could have destroyed Galactica or destroyed the Fleet ships, and yet Cavil's actions to carry out the PLAN consist of... have Aaron Doral (Cylon) be a suicide bomber and blow himself up somewhere.  Or... have Sharon Valerii (Cylon) damage the water systems.  Or... have Shelly Godfrey (Cylon) try to discredit Gaius Baltar.Cavil creates overly complicated plans all leading towards the destruction of the Fleet, but NONE of them are as direct or effective as ""Blow up the engine"" or ""Manipulate someone to lead the Fleet into a Cylon trap"".  It's always half-crazed, ridiculous plots like ""Blow up a minor, insignificant ship"", ""Kill Commander Adama"", those sorts of things.Meanwhile, we also follow another Cavil on Caprica, following along with Samuel Anders' guerrilla band against the Cylons.  His is the better story, as he begins to feel they were mistaken in trying to kill all humans, and showing the utterly alien notions of humanity to the Cylons, best exemplified when he asks Anders why he still loves certain members of his band, even though they are now dead.The idea of no longer loving someone because they are dead is something so utterly alien to us, yet it shows us just how alien the Cylons are, at least this early into the series.  Caprica-Cavil is not so alien, though, that he comes to understand this concept, and all at once begins to change, as opposed to Galactica-Cavil, whose hatred of humans only grows the more his daffy schemes are quashed.Aside from that, ""The Plan"" is a gift for Battlestar Galactica fans who want/need more after the end of the series.  Killer music and a great opening scene which shows the attack on the colonies with much more explicitness than the series offered.",3,The Plan: Kill all Humans!,1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,2917,"['simple', ""'d"", 'think', 'given', 'much', 'what', 'happened', 'series', 'Cavil', 'himselves', 'would', 'be', 'obvious', 'enough.But', 'given', 'immense', 'amount', 'mystery', 'intrigue', 'emphasis', 'placed', 'whole', 'THEY', 'HAVE', 'PLAN', 'bit', ""'d"", 'expect', 'match', 'what', 'series', 'was', 'giving', 'heaping', 'doses', '-pseudo-religious', 'mythical', 'spiritual', 'perhaps', 'even', 'psychological', 'motivations', 'attack', 'Humanity', 'Perhaps', 'something', 'as', 'grandiose', 'Cylons', 'did', 'not', 'WANT', 'attack', 'humanity', 'God', 'ordered', 'Cylons', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'mythology', 'Flood', 'test', 'survivors', 'prove', 'worth', 'Nope', 'Kill', 'Humans', 'Cavils', 'pretty', 'much', 'make', 'fact', 'non-negotiable.Without', 'going', 'spoilers', ""'ll"", 'point', 'Cavil', 'PLAN', 'Galactica', 'surviving', 'Colonial', 'Fleet', 'literally', 'cartoonish', 'plotting', 'execution', 'Cavil', 'CONSTANTLY', 'whines', 'complains', 'bitches', 'Fleet', 'surviving', 'attack', 'yet', 'NEVER', 'just', 'outright', 'fleet.Obviously', 'Cylon', 'fleet', 'can', 'not', 'catch', 'up', 'Colonials', 'Cylons', 'board', 'Galactica', 'can', 'not', 'contact', 'Cylon', 'fleet', 'directly', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'could', 'have', 'destroyed', 'Galactica', 'destroyed', 'Fleet', 'ships', 'yet', 'Cavil', 'actions', 'carry', 'out', 'PLAN', 'consist', 'have', 'Aaron', 'Doral', 'Cylon', 'be', 'suicide', 'bomber', 'blow', 'somewhere', 'have', 'Sharon', 'Valerii', 'Cylon', 'damage', 'water', 'systems', 'have', 'Shelly', 'Godfrey', 'Cylon', 'try', 'discredit', 'Gaius', 'Baltar.Cavil', 'overly', 'complicated', 'leading', 'destruction', 'Fleet', 'NONE', 'are', 'direct', 'effective', 'Blow', 'up', 'engine', 'Manipulate', 'someone', 'lead', 'Fleet', 'Cylon', 'trap', 'always', 'half-crazed', 'ridiculous', 'plots', 'Blow', 'up', 'minor', 'insignificant', 'ship', 'Kill', 'Commander', 'Adama', 'sorts', 'things.Meanwhile', 'also', 'follow', 'Cavil', 'Caprica', 'following', 'along', 'Samuel', 'Anders', 'guerrilla', 'band', 'Cylons', 'better', 'story', 'feel', 'were', 'mistaken', 'trying', 'kill', 'humans', 'showing', 'utterly', 'alien', 'notions', 'humanity', 'Cylons', 'best', 'exemplified', 'when', 'Anders', 'why', 'still', 'certain', 'members', 'band', 'even', 'are', 'now', 'dead.The', 'idea', 'longer', 'loving', 'someone', 'are', 'dead', 'something', 'so', 'utterly', 'alien', 'just', 'how', 'alien', 'Cylons', 'are', 'least', 'early', 'series', 'Caprica-Cavil', 'not', 'so', 'alien', 'though', 'understand', 'concept', 'once', 'begins', 'change', 'opposed', 'Galactica-Cavil', 'hatred', 'humans', 'only', 'more', 'daffy', 'schemes', 'are', 'quashed.Aside', 'Plan', 'gift', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fans', 'who', 'want/need', 'more', 'end', 'series', 'Killer', 'music', 'great', 'opening', 'scene', 'attack', 'colonies', 'much', 'more', 'explicitness', 'series', 'offered']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

1268766,A1CQGAPQMN41LV,B002HRF68A,"A. Whitehead ""Werthead""","[4, 5]","The Plan is a TV movie that goes right back to the Battlestar Galactica mini-series and then revisits key moments from the first two seasons through the eyes of the Cylons. Along the way, it attempts to resolve several key problems with the series, notably a few major plot holes left gaping and to give a lot more screen time and character development to Rick Worthy's character, Simon, arguably the least-developed Cylon role. In this movie we learn that there was a Simon model in the fleet after all and what he was doing, and discover that this Cylon was married with a step-daughter. This also allows the return of Edward James Olmos' real-life wife Lymari Nadal as Giana, one of the refugees from Caprica that Boomer rescued in the pilot, and a revelation about the ultimate fate of her character.To some degree, these are small-fry questions, however, with bigger questions like how Boomer's sleeper programming worked, who the unknown person Caprica-Six was meeting on Caprica during the mini-series was and what was going on with Shelly Godfrey and her attempt to manipulate Baltar being more thoroughly explored. In some cases the answers are interesting, but in other cases not really that necessary, with fans long ago coming up with decent answers.Overall, especially in the first half, the exercise feels like an excuse to show off some excellent CGI (and some rather ropier effects as well, including one terrible shot that makes Caprica look like it's about three miles across) but mainly to fill in some plot holes only obsessive nitpicking fans worry about. In the second half, however, a more interesting story emerges. Essentially A Tale of Two Cavils, in the second half the experiences of Galactica Cavil and Caprica Cavil are contrasted and explored in a decent manner, with Simon's situation and Anders' rise from being a sports jock to a military leader unfolding as decent subplots. These elements are tied together with some great writing and some excellent acting (especially from Dean Stockwell as Cavil, who comes across as calculating, intelligent and utterly ruthless, even moreso than he did in the series). The storylines also have a great conclusion when Caprica Cavil is rescued along with the rest of Anders' rebel group and meets up with his fellow model number in Galactica's brig and airlock where they discuss their conclusions, which are very different.Whilst that thematic structure works well, the 'unrated' version of the DVD/Blu-Ray makes rather gratuitous use of its freedom to depict sex and nudity, most notably a rather incongruous Galactica crash-zoom on a nude pilot in the locker room. I suppose if you are going to include nudity, doing so for both sexes is fair, but none of it adds anything to the plot and looks completely out of keeping with the rest of the series.Battlestar Galactica: The Plan (***) is the series' swansong and on that note is altogether stronger than the actual series finale itself. However, whilst the movie eventually gets it together and has a solid second half, the first half is all over the place, story and effects-wise, and takes probably too long to cut to the chase. Still, an interesting addition to the series. It is available now on DVD and Blu-Ray in the United States. A UK release has not yet been confirmed (although a region-free UK import of the Blu-Ray is available). An edited version of the movie will air on SyFy in the United States and Sky One in the UK some time in 2010.",3,Variable in quality,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,3477,"['Plan', 'TV', 'movie', 'right', 'back', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'mini-series', 'then', 'key', 'moments', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'eyes', 'Cylons', 'way', 'resolve', 'several', 'key', 'problems', 'series', 'notably', 'few', 'major', 'plot', 'holes', 'left', 'gaping', 'give', 'lot', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'development', 'Rick', 'Worthy', 'character', 'Simon', 'arguably', 'least-developed', 'Cylon', 'role', 'movie', 'learn', 'was', 'Simon', 'model', 'fleet', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'discover', 'Cylon', 'was', 'married', 'step-daughter', 'also', 'return', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'real-life', 'wife', 'Lymari', 'Nadal', 'Giana', 'one', 'refugees', 'Caprica', 'Boomer', 'rescued', 'pilot', 'revelation', 'ultimate', 'fate', 'character.To', 'degree', 'are', 'small-fry', 'questions', 'however', 'bigger', 'questions', 'how', 'Boomer', 'sleeper', 'programming', 'worked', 'who', 'unknown', 'person', 'Caprica-Six', 'was', 'meeting', 'Caprica', 'mini-series', 'was', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Shelly', 'Godfrey', 'attempt', 'manipulate', 'Baltar', 'being', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'explored', 'cases', 'answers', 'are', 'interesting', 'other', 'cases', 'not', 'really', 'necessary', 'fans', 'long', 'ago', 'coming', 'up', 'decent', 'answers.Overall', 'especially', 'first', 'half', 'exercise', 'feels', 'excuse', 'show', 'off', 'excellent', 'CGI', 'rather', 'ropier', 'effects', 'as', 'well', 'including', 'one', 'terrible', 'shot', 'Caprica', 'look', 'three', 'miles', 'mainly', 'fill', 'plot', 'only', 'obsessive', 'nitpicking', 'fans', 'worry', 'second', 'half', 'however', 'more', 'interesting', 'story', 'emerges', 'Essentially', 'Tale', 'Two', 'Cavils', 'second', 'experiences', 'Galactica', 'Cavil', 'Caprica', 'Cavil', 'are', 'contrasted', 'explored', 'decent', 'manner', 'Simon', 'situation', 'Anders', 'rise', 'being', 'sports', 'jock', 'military', 'leader', 'unfolding', 'decent', 'subplots', 'elements', 'are', 'tied', 'together', 'great', 'writing', 'excellent', 'acting', 'especially', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Cavil', 'who', 'calculating', 'intelligent', 'utterly', 'ruthless', 'even', 'moreso', 'did', 'series', 'storylines', 'also', 'have', 'great', 'conclusion', 'when', 'Caprica', 'Cavil', 'rescued', 'rest', 'Anders', 'rebel', 'group', 'up', 'fellow', 'model', 'number', 'Galactica', 'brig', 'airlock', 'where', 'discuss', 'conclusions', 'are', 'very', 'different.Whilst', 'thematic', 'structure', 'well', ""'unrated"", 'version', 'DVD/Blu-Ray', 'rather', 'gratuitous', 'use', 'freedom', 'depict', 'sex', 'nudity', 'most', 'notably', 'rather', 'incongruous', 'Galactica', 'crash-zoom', 'nude', 'pilot', 'locker', 'room', 'suppose', 'are', 'going', 'include', 'nudity', 'doing', 'so', 'sexes', 'fair', 'none', 'anything', 'plot', 'completely', 'keeping', 'rest', 'series.Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Plan', '***', 'series', 'swansong', 'note', 'altogether', 'stronger', 'actual', 'series', 'finale', 'However', 'whilst', 'movie', 'eventually', 'together', 'solid', 'second', 'half', 'first', 'half', 'place', 'story', 'effects-wise', 'probably', 'too', 'long', 'cut', 'chase', 'Still', 'interesting', 'addition', 'series', 'available', 'now', 'DVD', 'Blu-Ray', 'United', 'States', 'UK', 'release', 'not', 'yet', 'been', 'confirmed', 'region-free', 'UK', 'import', 'Blu-Ray', 'available', 'edited', 'version', 'movie', 'will', 'air', 'SyFy', 'United', 'States', 'Sky', 'One', 'UK', 'time', '2010']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

1268769,AYQP8XMHTG2YR,B002HRF68A,Brandon J. Smith,"[5, 8]","First of all, if you haven't seen at least the first two seasons, and if you don't know about the Final Five as revealed in season four, you could find yourself very confused by this movie. In some ways, The Plan is a disjointed film - but it's the nature of the story being told. The Plan shows events that the viewer is expected to have already seen from a different perspective.And it's pulled off brilliantly.To avoid spoilers, I'll say only this about the story: The anchor is Cavil, aka Cylon #1. Though we get numerous sub-plots involving other Cylons and their human connections, it's Cavil that provides the main thread that keeps the story going. And make no mistake, Dean Stockwell's performance is a revelation in itself. Already a sci-fi legend, I don't think I could overstate how extraordinary he is in this picture.Edward James Olmos does a fantastic job directing, matching the look and feel of past episodes, revisiting scenes from the series and weaving in the new elements. And, of course, it all starts with the writing.

It was arguably the greatest sci-fi TV program ever made, if only because it was essentially one long, grand story arc that never really jumped the shark and came to a logical and reasonably satisfying conclusion. As for ""Battlestar Galactica: The Plan"" ...THE GOOD: Some very cool special effects involving the Cylons nuking the colonial worlds. The tension is palpable as various Cylon vessels materialize in orbit and deploy some pretty serious thermonuclear weaponry. Some pretty well-rendered explosions, with imaginative cityscapes reduced to ruin. Unfortunately, all this takes place at the very beginning of the movie. After that, it's ...NOT-SO-GOOD: Anyone looking forward to more Cylon backstory is going to be greatly disappointed. I suppose that's what the upcoming prequel series ""Caprica"" is going to explore, but even so, I was hoping for a little more detail about how the Cylons went about hatching their plan against the Colonies. Instead, the film begins less than one day before the Cylon attack.As mentioned above, the attack itself is depicted pretty brilliantly. Sadly, it's the high point of the movie. After that, everyone is basically all dressed up with no place to go. We are left covering a lot of familiar territory, albeit from the Cylons' perspective. It's mostly just melodrama, with a little bit of sex, nudity, and violence thrown in for good measure. While a number of the main characters from BSG did not take an active role in this production, they do occasionally appear in what I can only assume are outtakes from the series.In a nutshell, disappointing ... and certainly MUCH more so than the pilot for ""Caprica,"" which was released on DVD earlier this year. I thought the pilot for ""Caprica"" was pretty frakking wonderful, and I would highly recommend it.

We'd heard and seen that concept a lot through the run of the spectacular TV series Battlestar Galactica. We didn't know what the plan was, really, beyond nuking the Colonies and eventually destroying humanity, but we assumed it was a pretty darn interesting plan!Battlestar Galactica: The Plan, the latest direct-to-DVD release from the SyFy Channel, shows us exactly what the plan was, and, as it turns out, it was... er... basically to nuke the Colonies and wipe out humanity. Everything else that happend was largely them reacting to the fact that there were still human remnants out there.The movie tells the story of the Cylon attack on the Colonies (and shows it in loving detail), and also tells us some of exactly what the Cylons were doing within the Fleet and on Caprica back during the early days of the series. You see how Cavil controlled Boomer, what Simon was up to both in the Fleet and on Caprica, you see how Anders and his crew ended up fighting as a resistance group and you really get an idea of how much of a puppet-master Cavil was.You'll see all the main characters on the show, though many of them just through re-used footage. You won't see Lucy Lawless' Cylon character, but you do see all the others, including a wonderful shot with two Cavils seeing the Final Five all standing together.You'll also see a lot more nudity than you might expect, including at least one gratuitious penis shot, and several breasts. You'll also see Edward James Olmos' wife in the all-together and you'll even see the upper half of the face of the long-missing Boxey.Extras on the DVD include deleted scenes, some behind the scenes stuff, a trailer for Caprica (which if you haven't yet seen, why not?), and a commentary by Edward James Olmos (who directed the movie), and Jane Espenson (who wrote it).Ultimately this is an excellent, if somewhat lacking, movie. I would've liked to have seen them do this as a four-hour film rather than two, because it would've been nice to carry it all the way to the end of the series. But that's ok.

This was a fabulous show, and I think The Plan was a great addition.While looking for the last piece of the series (see the end of the review), I came across some great deals (in terms of price), but was dismayed to see just how confusing things have become on Amazon. This review below is meant to help you wade through the mess in the marketplace, purchase the series, and enjoy it. I originally posted it for the combined Seasons 4.0 and 4.5 set, but someone kindly suggested I post it elsewhere as well. I hope you find it helpful.DVD CONFUSION-------------------------------------------------------The show is incredible. However, the whole DVD thing has been a disaster. They released it in the worst way possible (see below), Amazon compounded the problem by lumping together reviews for DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, and the DVD manufacturers seem to be changing the contents of some products. I cannot imagine how someone who is not deeply familiar with it is supposed to purchase this wonderful show. Certainly, they would hesitate to give it as a gift! Let's hope this solves your problem.In one sentence, I can say that here is what you want to get: Seasons 1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5, and The Plan. I have links to them below. If you get these, then you will be sure to have it all.========================================-Season One was released as (Battlestar Galactica  - Season One) altogether with the pilot in one box.-Season Two was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 2.0 (Episodes 1-10)andBattlestar Galactica: Season 2.5 (Episodes 11-20)in two boxes. You can now purchase them together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Seasons 2.0 & 2.5-Season Three was released together in one box asBattlestar Galactica - Season Three.-Season Four was released asBattlestar Galactica - Season 4.0andBattlestar Galactica: Season 4.5with the Razor episode. Those are now available together asBattlestar Galactica (2004): Season 4.0 & 4.5. Occasionally I come across things like ""Battlestar Galactica: Season 4.5 - Limited Edition Gift Set (2009)."" It seems like a lot of money for one part of the full season, but you get some dog tags with it, so if you are into collecting memorabilia, you might want to consider it.-The Plan was released on its own asBattlestar Galactica: The Plan========================================OPTIONS FOR PURCHASING THEM ALL TOGETHER: BAD TO GOOD--------------------------------------------------------Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON). Not recommended. I do not own this, but according to the reviews, it is packaged poorly WITHOUT AN EPISODE LIST. That seems like a horrible idea for four seasons of a tv show. Apparently, it contains the same DVDs as the ones sold separately (explained above).-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (the one in the GRAY BOX). *Recommended*. I do not own this. Good reviews of it so far. Packaging problems were fixed. According to a comment from customer Leif Sheppard, it does include The Plan.-Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series (with COLLECTIBLE CYLON) [BLU-RAY] or the gray box [BLU-RAY] set. *Recommended*. I do not own this. Seems to include some extras, but not significant. It also has an episode list, according to the reviews. It might be worth buying if you wanted to get everything together.BOTTOM LINE:-------------------------------------------------------As far as I can tell from the reviews, I think there are two choices:(1) Buy either Blu-Ray set or the Gray DVD set.(2) Purchase everything separately (make sure to get all of the stuff mentioned above).NOTE:--------------------------------------------------------The ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes (episodes shown only online) have not been made available for purchase in any of the sets as far as I can tell. What a shame!-Also, if anyone sees any mistakes in this review, please tell me and I will edit it.

Revisiting old territory leaves little room to learn anything new, and the movie certainly lives up to that assumption.  However, I am a big fan of revisiting familiar material from a new perspective, and this was pulled off perfectly.  First and foremost, this is Cavil's story during the first 2 seasons of the show.  Cavil, as fans of the series remember, was introduced at the very end of season two and he would go on to be an amazing character.  Seeing what he and his other self were up to prior to their original appearance on the series was alone worth the price of the DVD.  But it didn't stop there.  Leoben got a nice bit of attention, which pleased me greatly because I felt he was underrepresented in the final episodes of the series.  Doral had a funny couple of scenes.  We finally learn more about Six's Shelley Godfrey persona.  We got to see a whole other side to Boomer's story from season one.  The Final five mostly don't get much revealed, but we do get to see a lot of Anders in action as the leader of the resistance movement on Caprica.  The most pleasant surprise in this film though, was Simon.  The character had a great introduction in the season 2 episode ""The Farm,"" but they never really did anything interesting with him again.  Here he has his own story, and it's one of the better ones featured in this film.  I'm very pleased that they finally gave him something interesting to do.This film definitely lived up to expectations.  My expectations anyway, which is why it gets a full five stars from me.

It seems to be stitched together bits of new material along with some older stuff (some we've seen before and some we haven't). Cavil is the main character of this piece and rather than actually focusing on the Cylon's plan for humanity's destruction it really seems to be reiterating the one fatal flaw within the plan: the concept of 'love'. Cavil is thwarted all along the way simply because he cannot comprehend the ideas of love, friendship and fidelity. He seems to be lacking these qualities that all the other 'skin jobs' seem to possess to some degree and his struggle to understand it is sometimes funny, sad and down right scary at times. If the script hadn't been so choppy (which is surprising since it is written by Jane Espenson who has done some otherwise excellent work on this show as well as ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"") this could have been a fine addition to the BSG saga.  I strongly suspect that the Scy Fy Channel or whoever didn't want to foot the bill for a feature film with an all new story and consequently forced Espenson and Edward James Olmos (the director) to put something together based largely on previously existing material.  If that's the case then I still have to award kudos to those two for creating something at least half way interesting.Bottom Line:  If you are new to ""Battlestar Galactica"" DO NOT start here; instead get the Season One box set and begin the epic journey of this fabulous sci-fi series there.  If you are already a die hard BSG fan I think you will find some very rewarding material here as long as you keep your expectations low.P.S.

The fact is both films focus on things we already knew about in the BSG-verse. In The Plan it's the holocaust of the Colonies, the fact that the Cavill's are evil, that he manipulated the Final Five, that Boomer was a sleeper agent, and that some of the skin-job Cylons had reservations about the holocaust. We learn very little new here, and the tale is told in more of a travelougue-style series of disconnected vignettes rather than a cohesive plot with a beginning, middle, and end.Some of the revelations are far from jaw-dropping; Caprica Six secretly met Cavill after manipulating Baltar on Caprica; all of the ""Final Five"" had hints that ""this has happened before""; the Doral cylons aren't very bright; and ultimately we just don't give a damn about Sam Anders and his pyramid team, the Caprica Bucs. The only truly new information we get is that one of the Simon's was in love with his human wife and adopted child, that love changes things for the cylons, and a small bit about Caprica Six and Boomer really trying for a truce with the human race. Unfortunately this sub-plot was almost entirely left out of The Plan, and can only be seen via the ""Deleted Scenes"" Bonus Features.In the end none of this (not even the nude scenes, which don't feature any of the series stars naked, sorry) really adds much to the cannon of BSG, nor does it make up for the lack of an ending that Ron Moore gave us just six months ago in the series finale. Ultimately we are still left wanting more, more answers, more mind-frakking twists and turns like the series gave us. The Plan mostly fails to deliver on any of this.

It was nice to make a real connection with his character in The Plan.CONS* Missing characters - where was Roslin?  And Tory's appearances amounted to a cameo, not a role.* Sex and nudity - much like Caprica's pilot, this movie had scenes that added absolutely nothing to the storyline.

I was a *huge* BSG fan, but I held back on picking up ""The Plan"" for over a year, based largely on misleading Amazon comments that made it seem like this was basically a cheesy clip reel of previously-seen footage that was lazily strung together to form a new narrative based on the Cylons' point of view.I should have known better.  This feature-length film is mostly comprised of new footage, with some scenes from the original series brilliantly woven in, and the BSG producers were still in their full powers when they made it. (Unlike the wobbly ""Caprica"" series, which also explored the Cylon AI issues, but ultimately fell apart under the weight of low ratings and an unsupportive network...)Although the original series dealt with many of the spiritual issues confronting, dividing and uniting humans and Cylons, ""The Plan"" offers additional depth and a compelling new narrative arc. Indeed, its ending has a more reserved, less far-flung, far more satisfying feel than the big finale of the main BSG show. More subtle, easier to swallow given the gritty feel of what had gone before.  If you are a Galactica fan on the fence about picking this one up, don't hesitate any longer: it's totally worth it.

I didn't purchase the film but rented it from my local Blockbuster store to see how the DVD looked. I personally don't care for the artificial film grain BSG effects has always added, but I guess others out their love it. I have to expect the Blueray Version would look far superior to the DVD image. Someday I may be able to compare as I will someday purchase this film along with the entire BSG series on Blue Ray.The Plan is the final installment to the retelling of Battlestar Galactica. The film does not answer every continuity question a fan may have had, but it certainly answers some important questions. Others have said the film is a hacked clip job, I completely disagree and felt Edward James Olmos and his crew did a great job. The effects were excellent and this film truly has the best rendered effects of the series especially with the cylon basestars. The film covers 2 days before the attacks to 296 days after. The film is from the cyclons perspective and Dean Stock well as brother Cavil is the main character of the film. Every human cyclon except #3 D'Anna was able to come back for filming new footage. The beginning of the attacks does feature D'Anna only except its recycled footage from the series. Also any appearance of Kara Thrace in the film is recycled footage from the series. Of all the actors who were able to come back, #4 Simon has the best new footage and perspective not seen in the series.As I said in the title of my review, I highly recommend watching this film to fans of the series, but feel the film is a tough sell to recommend to first time viewers who never watched the series especially the pilot. Years from now there will always be people who watch ""The Plan"" before watching the rest of the series and it will be a disappointment because they will get answers to questions they didn't have yet. Anyone who buys the series, I say this film belongs at the end of the collection, not the beginning.Questions I had before watching this film and still have after watching it are:Why does #1 Brother Cavel destroy #7 model Daniel?What causes #1 to override what the final 5 had planed with the humans and cylons?Who are models #2 #3 #4 #5 #6 #8 based off of?Why did the final 5 make human bodies and than assume identities in the 12 colonies?When did the mechanical centurions make the transition from talking robots that carried firearms to silent walking robots with concealed machine guns in arms?All these questions I have unanswered hopefully will some day be answered in ""Caprica"".Battlestar Galactica will always be one of the greatest shows of the 2000s and this film is an great final addition to the series.Any new information fans may learn of the show they will get from Caprica. As said in the commentary, this really is it with BSG as the sets are gone and the actors have moved on.",4,"Recomend this film for fans, hard sell for First Time Viewers",1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2951,"[""'ve"", 'watched', 'film', 'twice', 'now', 'was', 'glad', 'listened', 'director', 'commentary', 'posting', 'review', 'did', ""n't"", 'purchase', 'film', 'rented', 'local', 'Blockbuster', 'store', 'see', 'how', 'DVD', 'looked', 'personally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'artificial', 'film', 'grain', 'BSG', 'effects', 'always', 'added', 'guess', 'others', 'out', 'love', 'have', 'expect', 'Blueray', 'Version', 'would', 'look', 'far', 'superior', 'DVD', 'image', 'Someday', 'may', 'be', 'able', 'compare', 'will', 'someday', 'purchase', 'film', 'entire', 'BSG', 'series', 'Blue', 'Ray.The', 'Plan', 'final', 'installment', 'retelling', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'film', 'not', 'answer', 'continuity', 'question', 'fan', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'certainly', 'important', 'questions', 'Others', 'have', 'said', 'film', 'hacked', 'clip', 'job', 'completely', 'disagree', 'felt', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'crew', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'effects', 'were', 'excellent', 'film', 'truly', 'best', 'rendered', 'effects', 'series', 'especially', 'cylon', 'basestars', 'film', '2', 'days', 'attacks', '296', 'days', 'film', 'cyclons', 'perspective', 'Dean', 'Stock', 'well', 'brother', 'Cavil', 'main', 'character', 'film', 'human', 'cyclon', '3', ""D'Anna"", 'was', 'able', 'come', 'back', 'filming', 'new', 'footage', 'beginning', 'attacks', 'feature', ""D'Anna"", 'only', 'except', 'recycled', 'footage', 'series', 'Also', 'appearance', 'Kara', 'Thrace', 'film', 'recycled', 'footage', 'series', 'actors', 'who', 'were', 'able', 'come', 'back', '4', 'Simon', 'best', 'new', 'footage', 'perspective', 'not', 'seen', 'series.As', 'said', 'title', 'review', 'highly', 'recommend', 'watching', 'film', 'fans', 'series', 'feel', 'film', 'tough', 'sell', 'recommend', 'first', 'time', 'viewers', 'who', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'especially', 'pilot', 'Years', 'now', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'Plan', 'watching', 'rest', 'series', 'will', 'be', 'disappointment', 'will', 'get', 'answers', 'questions', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'yet', 'Anyone', 'who', 'series', 'say', 'film', 'end', 'collection', 'not', 'beginning.Questions', 'had', 'watching', 'film', 'still', 'have', 'watching', 'are', 'Why', '1', 'Brother', 'Cavel', 'destroy', '7', 'model', 'Daniel', 'What', '1', 'override', 'what', 'final', '5', 'had', 'planed', 'humans', 'cylons', 'Who', 'are', 'models', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '8', 'based', 'Why', 'did', 'final', '5', 'make', 'human', 'bodies', 'assume', 'identities', '12', 'colonies', 'When', 'did', 'mechanical', 'centurions', 'make', 'transition', 'talking', 'robots', 'carried', 'firearms', 'silent', 'walking', 'robots', 'concealed', 'machine', 'guns', 'arms', 'questions', 'have', 'unanswered', 'hopefully', 'will', 'day', 'be', 'answered', 'Caprica', '.Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'greatest', 'shows', '2000s', 'film', 'great', 'final', 'addition', 'series.Any', 'new', 'information', 'fans', 'may', 'learn', 'show', 'will', 'get', 'Caprica', 'As', 'said', 'commentary', 'really', 'BSG', 'sets', 'are', 'gone', 'actors', 'have', 'moved']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan
1268793,A1CA481B2BKC2Y,B002HRF68A,Dusty Bottoms is Dead & Gone,"[0, 0]","'The Plan' is not a stand alone film; it's more like a Cylon character study full of non-groundbreaking plot revelations and appreciated but possibly irrelevant back-story .  For the unapologetic BSG fans, who even enjoyed the loose ends left post-finale to boggle our minds but who still crave answers , this is certainly a necessary addition to your DVD collection.  It deserves praise, as it provides a fresh perspective on the show's devious skinjobs; however, it is not the end-all, plot hole-filling, series-capper many had hoped for.The short film is mostly fresh material, but there is a heavy amount of stock footage as well.  It's presented like a series of somewhat disjointed cinematic vignettes, with over-arching themes and an illuminating spotlight on the Cylons, and it explores the side of the story shrouded in mystery during BSG's first two seasons.We learn how the final five survive the nuclear holocaust on the Twelve Colonies, that set off T.V.'s most epic and well-written Space Opera.  The curtain pulled over their 2000yr old eyes is explained, and Boomer's sleeper state is fully elaborated on.  Ultimately, the primal source of the Human/Cylon conflict is dissected to near-Shakespearean lengths, making the analytic focus on the 'Toasters' a fascinating and welcomed move that accomplishes a great deal in limited amount of time.The portrayal of the two Cavils is careful and poetic.  Anders receives the much needed attention he never got.  Leoben and Simon are also explored in an empathetic manner.  None of it is quite character-developing, but it does provide a copious amount of insight into the complexities and differences between each Cylon model and even within them.Something I found a bit of a let down, was the complete absence of Cylon model #7, Daniel or even any mentioning of him.  But the series managed to due without telling that part of the story, so I guess 'The Plan' can too.Highly Recommended.  With the caution to have practical expectations.",4,The Plan..

1268794,A35AMPDFAB8JLT,B002HRF68A,Edmonson,"[0, 0]","Battlestar Galactica's ""The Plan"" basically follows two of Cavil's clones, with the film starting off with these two Cavil clones waiting in the airlock of the Battlestar Galactica as they are about to be jettisoned into space. We then go back ten months in time to the day of the Cylon attack of Caprica. From here we skip through time following the two Cavil clones, one stationed on the Battlestar Galactica and the other on Caprica, as we witness their failures to finish off the human race. One failed attempt after another follows for numerous reasons, including the fact that some of the Cylons, through close contact with the humans, begin to have feelings for them. And interestingly enough even one of Cavil's clones backs away from killing Kara Thrace ""Starbuck"", even though he has her in his gun sights. The Cylons eventually decide that they no longer have any interest in killing off the rest of the human race. And after a vote, which isn't unanimous, the Cylons leave the humans to pick up the remaining pieces of their kind.This film has all of the gorgeous special effects of the TV show, but it does sometimes come across like a hodgepodge of the various episodes leading up to the airlock execution scene of the two Cavils, instead of a unique story unto itself, like we had with the Battlestar Galactica movie ""Razor"". I didn't feel like I learned too much more than I already knew from the series, though it was interesting to get a fuller view of the importance of the Cavil character, and learn more about how he was attempting to orchestrate the various Cylon models so as to finish off the human race. Though viewing the film, after recently watching the entire series, I was sometimes feeling that I was being short changed from what I had experienced while watching the series episode by episode. For instance, the incarceration scene of Kara in the hospital in the series episode, is breezed through in this film with merely a scene of her escape. In the episode she was disoriented and wondered what hellish place she was in, and what kinds of operations the Cylons had been performing on her, but in ""The Plan"" we jump from an exterior shot of the hospital, to her stabbing of the doctor, and then her quick escape, and we totally lose the sense of fear and anguish that Kara had experienced in that particular episode. The movie has this rapid fire quality to it that at times leaves one feeling that something is missing. Though one of the scenes that added a surprisingly visceral punch was Cavil's abrupt murder of the young boy, which was akin to Number Six's unsettling murder of a human baby in the pilot episode.If one hasn't watched the series I wouldn't recommend starting with this movie since it also gives away some of the surprises about who among the humans are the Cylons. And for those who have watched all of the episodes, even though ""The Plan"" fails to create the same kind of drama that the episodes offered as the viewer gradually learned the various secrets of the series, this film is still worth watching, especially in HD, as it fills in some of the missing pieces.",4,Cavil's failure to lead...,1256601600,"10 27, 2009",2009,3123,"['Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'Plan', 'basically', 'two', 'Cavil', 'clones', 'film', 'starting', 'off', 'two', 'Cavil', 'clones', 'waiting', 'airlock', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'are', 'be', 'jettisoned', 'space', 'then', 'go', 'back', 'ten', 'months', 'time', 'day', 'Cylon', 'attack', 'Caprica', 'here', 'skip', 'time', 'following', 'two', 'Cavil', 'clones', 'one', 'stationed', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'other', 'Caprica', 'witness', 'failures', 'finish', 'off', 'human', 'race', 'One', 'failed', 'attempt', 'numerous', 'reasons', 'including', 'fact', 'Cylons', 'close', 'contact', 'humans', 'begin', 'have', 'feelings', 'interestingly', 'enough', 'even', 'one', 'Cavil', 'clones', 'away', 'killing', 'Kara', 'Thrace', 'Starbuck', 'even', 'gun', 'sights', 'Cylons', 'eventually', 'decide', 'no', 'longer', 'have', 'interest', 'killing', 'off', 'rest', 'human', 'race', 'vote', ""n't"", 'unanimous', 'Cylons', 'leave', 'humans', 'pick', 'up', 'remaining', 'pieces', 'kind.This', 'film', 'gorgeous', 'special', 'effects', 'TV', 'show', 'sometimes', 'come', 'hodgepodge', 'various', 'episodes', 'leading', 'up', 'airlock', 'execution', 'scene', 'two', 'Cavils', 'instead', 'unique', 'story', 'had', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'movie', 'Razor', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'learned', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'already', 'knew', 'series', 'was', 'interesting', 'get', 'fuller', 'view', 'importance', 'Cavil', 'character', 'learn', 'more', 'how', 'was', 'attempting', 'orchestrate', 'various', 'Cylon', 'models', 'so', 'finish', 'off', 'human', 'race', 'viewing', 'film', 'recently', 'watching', 'entire', 'series', 'was', 'sometimes', 'feeling', 'was', 'being', 'short', 'changed', 'what', 'had', 'experienced', 'watching', 'series', 'episode', 'episode', 'instance', 'incarceration', 'scene', 'Kara', 'hospital', 'series', 'episode', 'breezed', 'film', 'merely', 'scene', 'escape', 'episode', 'was', 'disoriented', 'wondered', 'what', 'hellish', 'place', 'was', 'what', 'kinds', 'operations', 'Cylons', 'had', 'been', 'performing', 'Plan', 'jump', 'exterior', 'shot', 'hospital', 'stabbing', 'doctor', 'then', 'quick', 'escape', 'totally', 'lose', 'sense', 'fear', 'anguish', 'Kara', 'had', 'experienced', 'particular', 'episode', 'movie', 'rapid', 'fire', 'quality', 'times', 'leaves', 'one', 'feeling', 'something', 'missing', 'one', 'scenes', 'added', 'surprisingly', 'visceral', 'punch', 'was', 'Cavil', 'abrupt', 'murder', 'young', 'boy', 'was', 'akin', 'Number', 'Six', 'unsettling', 'murder', 'human', 'baby', 'pilot', 'episode.If', 'one', ""n't"", 'watched', 'series', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'starting', 'movie', 'also', 'away', 'surprises', 'who', 'humans', 'are', 'Cylons', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'episodes', 'even', 'Plan', 'create', 'same', 'kind', 'drama', 'episodes', 'offered', 'viewer', 'gradually', 'learned', 'various', 'secrets', 'series', 'film', 'still', 'worth', 'watching', 'especially', 'HD', 'missing', 'pieces']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

1268798,AD4SFJEVWEQ4G,B002HRF68A,Enlightened Soul,"[0, 0]",I really enjoyed The Plan.  It helped me fill with a new BSG fix and was great to see an in depth view into the backstory of all twelve Cylons.  I especially loved the more in depth development of the different personality types within the 7 Cylon models.

It essentially covers, in two hours, the BSG series from just before the Cylon attacks on the colonies to the time when the Brothers Cavill (the Cylon played by Dean Stockwell) get blown out the airlock.  BSG: TP is all about the Cyclon point of view, filling in a few narrative blanks here and there, concentrating primarily on two incarnations of Cavill and their respective viewpoints, with some addtional attention paid to the remaining Cylons and how different they are from their model copies.The show takes some footage from the BSG series and uses it in the storyline, but a lot of what's presented is new footage.  Cavill's interaction with a human boy on the battlestar is particularly interesting and, in the end, shocking while not necessarily surprising given his incarnation's opinion of the human race.This would be best viewed as part of a BSG boxed set after a marathon viewing of the entire series, when everything that transpired was fresh in your mind.

Come to think of it ""The Plan"" was better then the final episode again not saying a whole lot.  I don't hate ""The Plan"" by a long shot but just because something has the BSG label on it doesn't automatically make it good.  The problem with this installment from the BSG universe are twofold the obvious being that we already know what is going to happen seeing what is going to happen from a different angle doesn't make an already resolved plot line any more interesting.  The other problem is that there wasn't enough time now this may seem to contradict the previous sentence but I will explain.  There is some new information in here that is very good for example the boy that the Cavil on Galactica takes under his wing, the little family that the Simon has on a different ship in the fleet, the first days of the Caprica resistance under Anders with its own Brother Cavil undergoing his own crisis of faith.

Arnold,"[3, 3]","As I watched this ""sequel"" that was supposed to explain THE PLAN, I couldn't help but feel I was watching something of a ""recap"" reel. Though I know there was new footage, new revelations, such as they were, I also know they used a whole lot of previous or enhanced footage.What this film did do was flesh out some areas of question, but not in as satisfying a way as one would have liked.Spoiler Alert: Do not proceed if you don't want to know...It seems to me that the PLAN kind of evolved as they went along, that they didn't really have as clear a Plan as was implied. I mean, yes, they wanted to exterminate humanity. Failing that, they sought them out to finish the job - but came to an epiphany through their ""planted"" agents, this being that humanity still had much to teach the Cylons. The evidence is in the repeated phrase, ""This has happened before"", or however it was specifically said. The point is that embedded deep within their pysche, if the Cylons can have that, as it appears they can, and during the series we learn how that came to be, they knew something about the cyclical nature of the ""ride"" they were on. History was repeating itself, and they knew it. How many cycles they had experienced was yet unknown, if that ever could be known. The challenge became - the Plan became - how to break the cycle. But we learned that during the series.Well, now, if you're a die hard fan of the show, you will find it necessary to own this. I mean, I'm glad I bought it and watched it. It was like having one more visit with old friends, if you will, in a similar way we watched the ""sequel"" material of Babylon 5, because we wanted to return to that universe and visit again for a while.

Ever since the TV series ended in March 2009, I've been getting withdrawal symptoms. The finale was not overly bad, it was actually rather emotional and sad. However, still too many unanswered questions lingered. With The Plan, some of the unanswered questions have finally been answered.The Plan actually started from 2 weeks before the Fall of Caprica to just around Season 2 of the TV series and not till the finale. I won't spoil it too much, but you do see more of the Cylons, their plottings and plannings that went completely unnoticed throughout the fleet. It was more like they formed a tiny little cult amongst themselves, held meetings within a makeshift chapel, possibly on Galactica and then plotted. Only the No.1, 4, 5, 6 and 8 (Sharon Valerii) were plotting.The entire Plan tele-movie was John or No.1 driven. He's the leader, leading the rest of his race to destroy the humans. However, his brother model No.1, Brother Cavil, sees things from a different point of view, which he doesn't and cannot accept. His vendetta against humanity must be absolute and unquestionably followed, even if resistance among his own model seems forthcoming, he will squash it all the same and proceed with his master plan. The disappearance of Shelly Godfrey was explained, it was rather sad what happened actually, but interesting to watch the banter.I don't want to spoil too much more, but let's just say that through humanity's drive to survive and live on, Brother Cavil saw a possibility for peace between humans and Cylons and acted on it with the rest of the Cylons on Caprica. However, John refused to acknowledge peace, he insisted to teach the Final Five a lesson and hope they would come crawling back to him to tell him that he was correct. And so their plan was destroyed, leading to the rest of the season.I was rather disappointed that Lucy Lawless didn't make an appearance in this series, because she was the driving force behind Season 3, and she had screen presence and could stand up to the No.1s. They did show her in a short snippet here and there, probably taken from Season 3, but otherwise, she had no air time. Dean Stockwell was excellent as No.1, conveying menace and vengeance throughout the entire movie. I will never again see him as Scott Bakula's personal computer from Quantum Leap!It was also interesting to note that when the Basestars attacked the Twelve Colonies, they turn their top and bottom Y-shaped sections to fit a symmetrical configuration before launching their nukes.

There is a tendency in most fiction to imply that the enemy is more capable of orchestrating and coordinating events to an almost inhuman level of preparedness. This is the kind of thinking that led to the persecutions of innocents during McCarthyism and the Red Scares of the 20th century as well as the present-day atmosphere of the War on Terror. The idea that the cylons were simply doing what they could to destroy the humans is all 'the plan' ever should have been. However, I wonder if even the notion that Cavil was behind every attack on Galactica might be too much. There is a certain amount of satisfaction in leaving certain mysteries, especially whether Ms. Godfrey is real or Head Six transformed, unexplained.For this reason, sometimes the most dramatically fulfilling story elements are those both introduced in ""'The Plan""' and having no strong relation to events beyond it. Illustrating this fact is that we finally see the Number 4 cylon model (Simon) developed via two copies more fully than in the entire series to great effect.Cavil:For the most part, what lends ""'The Plan""' its power is the Number Ones and their struggle to see their plan come to fruition. For many of the episodes not written by Ronald D. Moore, who introduced the character in '""Lay Down Your Burdens Part 1',"" the Cavils were a shadow of what they were under his penmanship. Except for a brief scene written by Mark Verheiden in ""'Eye of Jupiter',"" the Cavils have remained as uninteresting as most of the cylon race in Seasons 3 and 4. They only came alive again in scenes specifically written by Moore in ""'No Exit""' and again in the finale. It''s a huge comfort to see that writer Jane Espenson is up to the task of reinvigorating the character in a way I had previously thought only Moore could. His every word and movement were a joy to watch, and it was the right decision to focus the story on his model; I just wish that there were even more of him. The ultimate explanation for the Cavils'' actions could have used more elaboration, but was thoroughly satisfying because it was psychologically rooted and, therefore, dramatically powerful.What I particularly enjoyed about ""'The Plan""'' and what was the main driving mystery that viewers of the show had yet to uncover ' was how the Cavil who lived on Caprica came to see things differently than the Cavils (if they were any different) who would appear after '""Lay Down Your Burdens.'"" Rather than deplore humanity, the Cavil from Caprica delivered a message from the cylon race that it would stop pursuing the fleet and leave the survivors of the attack on the colonies alone. Until this story, it was unknown whether this Cavil was simply carrying out his orders or expressing something in which he truly believed. In this story, we learn, from the outset, that he had indeed internalized this message of peaceful coexistence, but what is left in the air until the end is how and why he came to this conclusion. Rather than being converted by some forced and sudden love of the humans ' which seems to happen somewhat implausibly to Ms. Godfrey ' Caprica Cavil is persuaded more by practicality. He is also forced to look into his psychological motivations more deeply than it is revealed the other Cavils, including the one on Galactica, have done. In this sense, Cavil's journey has an element of relatable realism to the human condition, as human history is full of self-delusion and denial or unawareness of psychological motivations, and that's what makes this story more a blessing than a curse to the overall story of Battlestar Galactica.Visual presentation and directing:Even on the more superficial terms of special effects, there is something beautiful in the first several minutes to how the cylon ships are shown moving into place and how the various colonial cities are depicted. Moreover, director Edward James Olmos has done a fantastic job of matching new scenes to a specific timeframe in the older footage from the series' past episodes. So, footage filmed several years apart flows seamlessly within a given scene.The use of insurgency as plot device and political commentary:I didn't much care for the insurgency storyline on Caprica because it failed to yield as much political commentary as 'Occupation'/'Precipice', which attempted to explore the causes for and issues involved in insurgency and collaboration across human history and into the present. I also tend not to enjoy action scenes much or that particular aspect of Anders' character, which was quite macho in Season 2. What I did like was the notion that Anders drew upon the idea for engaging in hit and run attacks from a movie. As is often the case on our culture, much of our knowledge of 'the other' is derived from popular culture and not academic works and, in times of crisis, we draw upon this entertainment for lessons on how to comprehend this 'other' and how to behave. The fact that the 'bad guys' in the film had used guerilla warfare and that humanity could, too, in resisting the cylons was, however slight, a moment of political insight. By referring to the reasons for terrorism in this way, the viewer is made to question whether this was necessarily a 'bad guy' approach at all ' as the US and Israel often hypocritically infer of their enemies' terrorist actions, while they use supposedly 'civilized' means of unjust laws and overwhelming force to kill hundreds of thousands more in more brutal and just as indiscriminate fashion.Another great element was a comment on the nature of heroism that made me think about things in a whole new light. At one point, Anders tells Caprica Cavil that, once he began leading his team in fighting the cylons, he realized that it was much more difficult and terrifying than he had expected when he had rallied them to wage guerrilla warfare. He tells him that he instinctually wanted to run away -- to not live up to his battle cry rhetoric. However, what kept him forging ahead was that one of his team members would have seen him retreat and that he wanted to avoid the shame of abandoning the very task he had pushed them to undertake. In this light, he was driven more by a desire to protect his image than the kind of personal ambition for glory or doing the right thing by the human race. I've never seen this explanation for heroic acts expressed this way in fiction or history, but this was a very honest and realistic and human set of motivations and feelings that I could imagine myself experiencing. I absolutely love it when I learn something new about human nature.Forced dramatic coherence:One of the essential ingredients that the best of Battlestar Galactica has maintained in its storytelling is how random life is ' how unexpected. Yet it is difficult to craft engaging drama from complete randomness, so a balance between realism and coherence must be struck to give the program its power and often has been. While 'The Plan' didn't suffer from as much cute tidiness and forced dramatic coherence as '""Razor',"" it still had those problems of tilting too much toward coherence. The most egregious mistake was made in an effort to have an interesting dramatic moment between Chief Tyrol and Giana (played well by Lymari Nadal) upon their realization that Boomer and the Simon she loved had carried out their missions so poorly because of their love for the humans. While Tyrol and Giana were ashamed to be associated so intimately with cylons, they found comfort in their loved ones' 'humanity' because it meant that they weren't simply hateful of the human race; indeed, many of those cylons ' beyond those specific Number 8 and Number 4 copies ' are shown in this movie to be reluctant to execute their orders to hurt or put into disarray Galactica''s crew because of this fact.This was a real addition to the program's storyline by making sense of mysterious story elements without taking away from the show's consistency. However, their bonding should have ended there. A mistake is made in overdoing the parallels between Tyrol and Giana by having her confess that she is not only suicidal over finding out her husband's identity, but has fantasized about killing herself by 'swan diving' from the upper section of the hangar bay. Through flashes, we are reminded that this is exactly what Tyrol had been dreaming about in ""'Lay Down Your Burdens Part 1'."" This is simply too convenient and completely unnecessary; while both characters might feel suicidal about their shame about loving cylons, it is highly unlikely they would think of committing suicide in the exact same way in the exact same place. Still, I enjoyed the tender way that Tyrol instinctually kissed her and especially the way they both understood that it was a lapse in judgment and how she consoled him as her comrade afterward.Similarly, a wonderful bit of texture given to the Leoben character had his model obsessively begin to listen to Starbuck's chatter over the radio. However, this was taken a bit too far and made too self-consciously referential to things to come, when he paints a mandala similar to that Starbuck had painted as a child and when he even sees the same visions she would; an error was even made in having him see a vision of himself as the angel that simply took his form (and was not him) that would speak to Starbuck in ""'Maelstrom'.""Over the top humor:One upsetting aspect, which is a definite holdover from Jane Espenson's history of writing Joss Whedon-style humor on '""Buffy the Vampire Slayer',"" is the tendency to have over-the-top humor. In one scene, a Doral (Number Five) assumes that no one in the fleet will recognize him because he has a teal colored blazer unlike the red one worn by the Doral copy that was labeled a cylon by the humans in the miniseries. In another scene, an irritating version of Number 6 uses the word 'hum' as a sleazy and forced double entendre, which Joss Whedon shows do far too much. These kinds of attempts at humor lessen the show because the levity doesn''t arise naturally from a context that should respect both the tone of the scene and consistency of the characters (Doral isn''t that stupid) and lacks originality (I could see that oral sex joke coming a mile away).Structural and pacing problems with the story:There is a dramatic problem inherent in the structure of the story that seems insurmountable. In many instances, the story is not as gripping as it might be due to having to provide the viewers with context of events by employing footage from Season Two and especially Season One. The dramatic potency of the mostly excellent first and second season episodes is lost by only using portions of those scenes. However, it would have been far worse to use more of this footage because the narrative drag would have been even greater; on the other hand, I cannot imagine not using some means of reminding viewers which incident taking place in past episodes that given cylon activity relates.Conclusion:So, while this is a mixed bag, it is considerably more welcome than not as an addition to the series for humanizing the series, which I have always thought was a commentary on humanity's tendency to dehumanize (""They're not like us!"") and homogenize (""They're all the same!"") ""the other"", whomever that might be throughout human history and into the present. In doing so, the show has long demanded the audience to realize that, therefore, we - including our heroic leaders - are just as capable of kindness and cruelty as our adversaries.",4,"More a blessing

Smith,"[0, 0]","One would expect that after three seasons of being told the cyclon's have ""A Plan"" that by the end of the series even if said plan went awry you would have a pretty good idea what that plan was.  Well I guess that by changing the prologue script for the beginning of season four the writers and producers forgot to put that on the agenda while they were busy trying to figure ways to tie up all the loose threads.  Hence we get another dip into the Sci fy channels most lucrative franchise.  Actually I was being a bit facetious BSG, while setting the bar incredibly high for what a television series could be, suffered from a form of schizophrenia -- it was a SF show that didn't want to be identified as a SF show, hence the one SF element that couldn't be denied was given very short shrift during the series run, namely an artificial life form that became self aware.That doesn't mean that ""The Plan"" isn't any good, it's actually pretty good if only for giving some characterization to some players that got practically no development while the show was airing (like Simon).  It's just that this is stuff that really should have been worked into the series while it was still airing. It's stuff that the show needed.

So began the opening of every episode of Battlestar Galactica. Through four seasons we saw the near genocide of the human race through the eyes of the humans, now with The Plan, we see it through the eyes of the Cylons.It took me a while to get into the cultural phenomenon that is Battlestar Galactica. Throughout it's run I was never really interested in checking it out, but finally after going on enough message boards filled with phrases like ""frak this"" ""frak that"" and ""what the frak"" I had to check it out. I borrowed the first season from a friend earlier this year and got hooked. After that I bought all the rest of the seasons and wasted no time watching them all. Battlestar Galactica has become more than just a fan favorite show, though, it's also become the only show in history to have the UN hold a symposium in it's honor, and has even affected the way the UN writes policies. Now, I should say that I'm not here to get into a fandom debate about what science fiction show has had more cultural impact (after all, Star Trek hosted the first interracial kiss on network television), but rather the (possibly?) final installment in the story of Galactica has recently been released on DVD. The question: does it hold up to the series?In all honesty, The Plan is a mixed bag. Directed by the series own Edward James Olmos (Captain Adama), The Plan looks and feels like a two hour episode of the show, if just a little more involved. In most cases, the decisions made on this show do a great job of moving the story along, but cutting them film to remind us who the ""final 5"" Cylons were is great for viewers who are just getting into the series through The Plan, but I would hope that most people would choose not to start here since it would cause you to loose some of the mystery of the show itself. Overall though, the writing and directing is solid, and like the rest of the series touches on pertinent sociopolitical themes: family quibbles leading to war, totalitarianism, genocide, etc.One of the really great things about The Plan is that the main character is the wise cracking Cylon Brother Cavil. Dean Stockwell plays Cavil with a giddy glee at the thought of genocide, and his character's enthusiasm is infectious, even if you are rooting for the humans. Most of the main characters aren't really seen much, but the performances we do see are right in line with what we remember from the series, and the movie gives us an interesting view of the other side of things.But while the movie starts out great, it eventually loses it's way. The destruction of the 12 colonies, and the scenes on Caprica are the best, but it's not easy to try to cram two seasons worth of info into just under two hours. This isn't the biggest problem with the movie though, the biggest problem has to do with the fact that this movie doesn't really add much to the proceedings. Since the writers didn't really plan the series as they went along, the Cylons don't really have a plan. So, while there are moments that make you go, ""Oh okay, that makes sense,"" there's nothing here to answer the many questions that were left at the end of the season finale.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I think it fit well with the series even if it didn't add anything. The general rule with this installment in the series is probably going to be something to the effect of: If you liked the series finale you'll probably like this, if you didn't this probably won't be your cup of tea. When checking this out, I have to warn you, where the series could be graphic at times, The Plan takes things a little further adding in a little extra gore and quite a bit of male and female nudity. It would be advisable to check this out before showing your children.3.5/5",4,Battlestar Galactica: The Plan,1261180800,"12 19, 2009",2009,3864,"['Cylons', 'were', 'created', 'man', 'evolved', 'rebelled', 'are', 'many', 'copies', 'have', 'plan', 'So', 'began', 'opening', 'episode', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'four', 'seasons', 'saw', 'near', 'genocide', 'human', 'race', 'eyes', 'humans', 'now', 'Plan', 'see', 'eyes', 'Cylons.It', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'cultural', 'phenomenon', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'run', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'interested', 'checking', 'out', 'finally', 'going', 'enough', 'message', 'boards', 'filled', 'phrases', 'frak', 'frak', 'what', 'frak', 'had', 'check', 'out', 'borrowed', 'first', 'season', 'friend', 'earlier', 'year', 'got', 'hooked', 'bought', 'rest', 'seasons', 'wasted', 'time', 'watching', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'become', 'more', 'just', 'fan', 'favorite', 'show', 'though', 'also', 'become', 'only', 'show', 'history', 'have', 'UN', 'hold', 'symposium', 'honor', 'even', 'affected', 'way', 'UN', 'policies', 'Now', 'should', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'here', 'get', 'fandom', 'debate', 'what', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'had', 'more', 'cultural', 'impact', 'Star', 'Trek', 'hosted', 'first', 'interracial', 'kiss', 'network', 'television', 'rather', 'possibly', 'final', 'installment', 'story', 'Galactica', 'recently', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'question', 'hold', 'up', 'series', 'honesty', 'Plan', 'mixed', 'bag', 'Directed', 'series', 'own', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'Captain', 'Adama', 'Plan', 'feels', 'two', 'hour', 'episode', 'show', 'just', 'little', 'more', 'involved', 'most', 'cases', 'decisions', 'made', 'show', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'moving', 'story', 'cutting', 'film', 'remind', 'who', 'final', '5', 'Cylons', 'were', 'great', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'just', 'getting', 'series', 'Plan', 'would', 'hope', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'choose', 'not', 'start', 'here', 'would', 'cause', 'loose', 'mystery', 'show', 'writing', 'directing', 'solid', 'rest', 'series', 'touches', 'pertinent', 'sociopolitical', 'themes', 'family', 'quibbles', 'leading', 'war', 'totalitarianism', 'genocide', 'etc.One', 'really', 'great', 'things', 'Plan', 'main', 'character', 'wise', 'cracking', 'Cylon', 'Brother', 'Cavil', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Cavil', 'giddy', 'glee', 'thought', 'genocide', 'character', 'enthusiasm', 'infectious', 'even', 'are', 'rooting', 'humans', 'Most', 'main', 'characters', 'are', ""n't"", 'really', 'seen', 'much', 'performances', 'do', 'see', 'are', 'right', 'line', 'what', 'remember', 'series', 'movie', 'interesting', 'view', 'other', 'side', 'things.But', 'movie', 'out', 'great', 'eventually', 'way', 'destruction', '12', 'colonies', 'scenes', 'Caprica', 'are', 'best', 'not', 'easy', 'try', 'cram', 'two', 'seasons', 'info', 'just', 'two', 'hours', ""n't"", 'biggest', 'problem', 'movie', 'biggest', 'problem', 'do', 'fact', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'much', 'proceedings', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'plan', 'series', 'went', 'along', 'Cylons', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'plan', 'So', 'are', 'moments', 'make', 'go', 'Oh', 'okay', 'sense', 'nothing', 'here', 'answer', 'many', 'questions', 'were', 'left', 'end', 'season', 'finale.All', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'think', 'well', 'series', 'even', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'general', 'rule', 'installment', 'series', 'probably', 'going', 'be', 'something', 'effect', 'liked', 'series', 'finale', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'did', ""n't"", 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'cup', 'tea', 'When', 'checking', 'have', 'warn', 'where', 'series', 'could', 'be', 'graphic', 'times', 'Plan', 'things', 'little', 'further', 'adding', 'little', 'extra', 'gore', 'quite', 'bit', 'male', 'female', 'nudity', 'would', 'be', 'advisable', 'check', 'out', 'showing', 'children.3.5/5']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

If, on the other hand, you were let down by the series finale because it didn't match whatever expectations you had about it, and you're hoping that ""The Plan"" will resolve whatever lingering dissatisfaction you have with the series, then you will probably be disappointed. I found ""The Plan"" to be absolutely as worthy as many of the best moments of the series, and even better than the other BSG film, ""Razor"" (which I also liked, but not as much as this). ""The Plan"" has great characterization, writing, acting, depth, humor, and special effects. The depiction of the destruction of the colonies at the opening ranks among the best battle scenes of the whole series. And if, like me, you're a Dean Stockwell (Cavil) fan, then you'll get a real treat with this film, since he is the main character(s), and he finally gets the room to develop Cavil into a fully-fledged personality, something which never quite happened in the series. Also, it puts a coda on the underlying meaning of the conflict between Cylons and humanity, and why the conflict became more and more convoluted as the series developed. For those who say that this is nothing but clips from the series, that is blatantly false: there are a few clips included for context, but 90% of the film is original material and even some of the material that was taken from the series seems to be recreated or else taken from different versions of the same shots (there are minor dialogue variations, for instance).

Lots of this movie is rehashed from the first season, with some new footage focusing on Dean Stockwell's character, Number One.  But the movie also doesn't jibe with the series.  At the beginning of the film, we see Stockwell and other cylons walking among  the as-yet-unresurrected Final Five before the strike on Caprica.

The title indicated that it would reveal the complexities and nuances of the Cylon plan, as well as tying up the loose ends that were left unanswered.As far as tying up the loose ends goes, I thought they did that rather well.  They explained who the 6 was meeting on Caprica, they showed how the rebels got started on Caprica.  They explained how Boomer worked.  I was always wondering what her deal was.  I thought they programmed her but instead hypnosis was involved.  They showed how the Cylons in the fleet were being orchestrated.The Cylon plan was actually pretty simple, destroy all the humans, we knew that much from watching the series.  The plan for the Cylons on the fleet was really non-existent.  They didn't have plan, they were just winging it.  I thought that the biggest weakness of the movie was the amount of scenes added in from the series.  I would guess that about a third of the movie was just scenes taken from the series.  I didn't really want to see all that again, or if I do, I would rather see it by rewatching the series.  But I watched it anyways because I was bored and lazy with nothing else to do.  I think that a major problem BSG is that the way they ended it puts a cap on the storyline that precludes any possibility for a sequel, so they're stuck either doing prequels (like Caprica) or elaborating on the storyline that is already there.  If you choose the latter option then it is going to be hard to do it without integrating footage from the series.  I think if the writers for the BSG SERIES had been smart they would have ended it in such a way that more could be made in the way of series and movies so that they could make it into a franchise, sort of like Star Trek.",3,Decent but not Superb,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,1876,"['First', 'felt', 'ending', 'BSG', 'series', 'really', 'killed', 'series', 'rather', 'devoted', 'fan', 'series', 'decided', 'see', 'Plan', 'title', 'indicated', 'would', 'reveal', 'complexities', 'nuances', 'Cylon', 'plan', 'as', 'well', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'were', 'left', 'unanswered.As', 'far', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'thought', 'did', 'rather', 'well', 'explained', 'who', '6', 'was', 'meeting', 'Caprica', 'showed', 'how', 'rebels', 'got', 'started', 'Caprica', 'explained', 'how', 'Boomer', 'worked', 'was', 'always', 'wondering', 'what', 'deal', 'was', 'thought', 'programmed', 'instead', 'hypnosis', 'was', 'involved', 'showed', 'how', 'Cylons', 'fleet', 'were', 'being', 'orchestrated.The', 'Cylon', 'plan', 'was', 'actually', 'pretty', 'simple', 'destroy', 'humans', 'knew', 'much', 'watching', 'series', 'plan', 'Cylons', 'fleet', 'was', 'really', 'non-existent', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'plan', 'were', 'just', 'winging', 'thought', 'biggest', 'weakness', 'movie', 'was', 'amount', 'scenes', 'added', 'series', 'would', 'guess', 'about', 'third', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'scenes', 'taken', 'series', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'do', 'would', 'rather', 'see', 'rewatching', 'series', 'watched', 'was', 'bored', 'lazy', 'nothing', 'else', 'do', 'think', 'major', 'problem', 'BSG', 'way', 'ended', 'cap', 'storyline', 'possibility', 'sequel', ""'re"", 'stuck', 'doing', 'prequels', 'Caprica', 'elaborating', 'storyline', 'already', 'there', 'choose', 'latter', 'option', 'then', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'do', 'integrating', 'footage', 'series', 'think', 'writers', 'BSG', 'SERIES', 'had', 'been', 'smart', 'would', 'have', 'ended', 'way', 'more', 'could', 'be', 'made', 'way', 'series', 'movies', 'could', 'make', 'franchise', 'sort', 'Star', 'Trek']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

We were going to learn what the plan was all about.What a let down the finished movies turned out to be. The perspective of the Cylons is nothing more than rehashed moments from the series. At times it appeared that scenes were taken from the series and edited into the movie. There were some new elements added into the movie ( a cylon with a family. co-ed showers), but nothing compared to what made the series interesting and fun to watch. And what about the plan? Turns out that the plan was the destruction of the human race. Wow, what a revelation. Of course I am being sarcastic. We knew that the Cylons wanted to destroy the human race from the very first episode.What the movie needs to be billed as is a two hour recap of the series. Let's be honest. That is all this movie is- a two hour recap. I saw the series. It was incredible and imaginative. Most episodes I can remember quite well. I don't need a reminder.

Or rather, I should say it satisfies that gap, because it still somehow doesn't feel full.This story focuses on the attempt of the Ones, played by Dean Stockwell, to complete the eradication of humanity, while trying to win the loyalty of the Final Five.  It weaves in and out of the first two seasons with the intricacy of an X-Files conspiracy theory.  This act of political subtlety is interesting and engaging.  And it certainly makes several Cylon models more complex and fully dimensional.What it lacks is a sense of interaction with the central narrative.  Though the BSG cast receives star billing, it mostly just recycles footage from the original series.  The Final Five have plenty to do, including closing holes in their back-story.  This story also gives closure to one character who just disappeared after the miniseries.  But this seems like a parallel rather than a complementary story.""The Plan"" will probably engage BSG regulars as it answers questions the story left open.  Though it does demand prior familiarity with the series context, I enjoyed it on balance.

But I am SICK TO DEATH of studios and filmmakers feeling the need to include mindlessly gratuitous sex and nudity just for the sake of making an extra buck.  The nudity and sex in this film get pointlessly graphic, and for NO REASON.  Overall, it does nothing to advance the story, or add to it.  It's just there.  And even when it might make a legitimate plot point, the sex could easily be implied rather that forced into the faces of the viewer.  We're smart people.  We are.  Man and woman lying naked in bed together?  They probably have a sexual relationship.  Man and woman in bed start kissing?  Cut away, and we are still smart enough to figure out what comes next.But no.  We just HAVE to have a scene with a topless bartender in the background.  And we have to see full nudity in the showers, because as viewers, we are just not smart enough to figure out that people shower naked.  Does full frontal nudity do ANYTHING to help the story along?  No.  They could be wrapped in towels, for crying out loud, and the film would be JUST AS GOOD.I love Battlestar Galactica: the stories, the actors, the effects, all of it.  But I lose a great deal of respect for filmmakers who feel they have to use sex and nudity to sell their films.  If the story cannot stand on its own without the gratuitous use of sex and skin, then it is a story not worth putting on film to begin with.

I happen to be a BIG fan of BSG, but I recognise the faults so many are grousing about here, on ""The Plan"".The feel is the same as we all know from watching the series, the SFX are the same, but it has the feel of a different POV. Sure, there are rehashed scenes from the series, but these are few, and are necessary to keep continuity of the ""new"" storyline. In many cases, you ARE treated to a different POV for all these scenes, be they sooo familiar.I said from the start that this film was made for the hardcore BSG fans, as ""The Plan"" turns no new corners, opens no boxes, to expand the story, rather, it more closely examines the relationships between the Cylons and Man. Personally, I didn't need the extra detail, as the series pretty much laid out the basics, and let's face it, you gotta be pretty dumb to not absorb what was presented previously, even WITH the plot holes and dead-ends. I found ""Razor"", even with it's similar intent: to flesh out a particular plot developement, a bit much. Still, ""Razor"" outclasses ""The Plan"" by a good measure.I found Edward J. Olmos' direction very nearly the same as the directors that helmed the series. An excellent job! Just so no one out there mistakes my intent, I enjoyed this film, just not to the extent that it requires more than a three-star rating. What transpired beyond the series that was originally aired, was a fun bit of ""how's the scene from here"".

For the first 3 seasons we were reminded constantly that the Cylons 'have a plan' during the intro sequence of each and every episode of BSG. I, like many, really hoped that plan would be laid out in a way that paid us off for having had to endure the reminders over 100+ episodes (it became a running joke among my friends and I as we watched the show). When the show itself didn't deliver anything meaningful aside from Cavel trying to get revenge on the final five 'creators,' it seemed like we would all be out of luck. When THE PLAN was announced, I had some hope that FINALLY we would all understand what the Cylons were up to aside from the obvious.SPOILER ALERTWell, what was the amazing plan revealed in the first 20 minutes of this true bomb of a movie? The plan was to kill all humans. Yes you read that right. I thought that was beyond obvious in the show itself and didn't really need any explanation, but the Cavel character literally states ""the plan was to kill all humans"" at one point, just in case you missed it. Nothing is mentioned about the farms on Caprica where Kara Thrace was held, nor the plan to try and breed human/cylon hybrids. Nothing is explained surrounding the mysterious connection with Leoben, although it is hinted at with new scenes of Leoben painting the same colorful universe painting that Kara did during the original show. Bottom line, there are no interesting revelations to be found here, just hash and re-hash of old material and boring characters (seriously, Cavel is so irritating it is almost infuriating to watch. Petty, silly, and all too childish to really fear).What follows the shocking revelation that the Cylon plan was to ""Kill all humans"" is about 90 more minutes of wasted time in which original BSG scenes are smashed together into something resembling a seriously long vignette of important parts of the first three seasons of BSG. This is done in shoddy fashion. The art direction of THE PLAN is far inferior to the original show. Cheap 3d rendered environments that look video game like (think of mid 2000s graphics), bad camera work (home camera quality at times) and no sense of style that made the original a feast for the eyes. This is just a BAD movie all the way around.The show also re-write history (so to speak) by showing how Cavel was personally responsible for just about everything negative that happened on Galactica, the fleet, and even New Caprica. This sort of simplification damages the original story by making the Cylons (and especially their hidden operatives) look like unmotivated, error prone buffoons. By the end of THE PLAN you'll wonder how the Cylons didn't off themselves with all their silly mistakes and lack of insight.It's incomprehensible why they thought they needed another 2 hours to drudge through the same material. You can safely skip THE PLAN and not miss anything. Razer looks like Academy Award material compared to this.1/5 Stars.

Featuring almost all of the known cylon models, this show emphasizes personal drama more than anything else.  It features nudity, sex, swearing, suicide, murder, and betrayal all up close.  There is almost no humor so the show's tones are quite dark.  The central message of the movie is love, and how the effects of love can screw up the best laid plans.

1268855,A2SA6LR78V49UV,B002HRF68A,"OrangeCrush ""Still shooting with Film!""","[42, 58]","I am a big fan of Battlestar Galactica. I think its one of the best written Sci Fi pieces to come along in a long time. I will openly admit that I was disappointed with the final season and I am not to keen on how it ended. Even as disappointing as season 5 was, it was still head and shoulders above your average sci fi material, especially material that's made for TV and I have no problem admitting that I was hoping to see more material as I just absolutely love the whole cyborg angle to science fiction. Its just such powerful subject matter as its literally becoming less sci fi and more reality by the day. In fact I just saw a BBC Horizon episode a few weeks back entitled Human 2.0. The subject of the show was the future of artificial intelligence and robots and there were aspects to that show that were literally frightening. In 50-100 years we will have the capability of producing robots that are smarter than us and similar to some of the robots we see in science fiction today and this just makes this whole concept extremely fascinating. This is why I love the whole cyborg premise so much and its also why I just cant seem to get enough of it.With that being said I really didn't know what to expect from The Plan. I had worries that this might just be an attempt to get as much money from the series as possible before its pretty much forgotten about and that may in fact be one of the the main reasons why this was produced. I honestly don't really care what the reasons are as this is definitely one of the more intriguing alternate angles, seeing things from the Cylon side. I honestly wasn't too worried about the fact that most of the main characters would not be present in this film as again the story and writing are so well done with this series that I was sure it could succeed even without those characters.Anyways I got around to watching The Plan last night and I absolutely loved it. I wont give anything away, ill simply say that if your a fan of this series then you simply cant miss this, not that you would have anyways. The first 15 minutes, which shows the attack on the colonies in much greater detail than previously shown is awesome. The sick and twisted side of me always wanted to see more of the attack and they have finally given us such footage. Some of the shots are really amazing. Its important to note that they have quite a bit of footage that you have already seen from the series inserted here and there as it gives you a reference time wise to the events taking place. It works extremely well in that regard and it also gives the main characters who have no new scenes, like Starbuck, a presence in this film. So really when you take this into account, there really aren't many characters missing from this film, a lot of them just don't have any new scenes.Overall the film doesn't hold the suspense and mystery that the series held but that is to be expected as we know the outcome of the series. This film isn't revealing anything new in regards to an ending, its simply filling in the holes in regards to what took place on the Cylon side. In other words its more about information than it is about action or suspense or mystery. The only other negative I can think of is that the film jumps around A LOT. Not only from person to person but also from time to time. Then again they are squeezing everything relevant that took place on the Cylon side into a 2 hour movie. They really are forced to jump around or they would have never been able to make this into a movie. It still has a somewhat negative effect on the film as it just seems all over the place at times.I was going to give it 4 stars but then I realized that most of the faults I saw in this film were simply a necessity in making this a film instead of its own series. There just wasn't the time to slowly reveal things and again the jumping around was a necessity. So I decided to give it 5 stars as they did a great job given the restrictions they had. Overall it was much better than I expected it to be.

The direction was fantastic, and the story-line was (generally) engaging.All that said, the Plan was more than a bit of a let-down.If you are a hard-core BSG fan then you are going to be disappointed by the lack of consistency and lack of follow-through with the Plan.  If you never watched the series, or, if you only watched pieces then you are going to be confused and disappointed.There really wasn't a plan at all.  The Plan did not explain the ""why"" of the fertility clinics on New Caprica.The fan base realized that the series evolved as time went on, and the fan base had a significant impact on the plot direction and importance of various characters.  In the pod casts, the production crew explained how some of the critical characters were actually designed originally to be side characters.Bravo to the writers and producers for using the fan feedback.But, sometimes less is more.  When Lucas tried to explain the origins of the Force as sub-cellular additions, it ruined the concept for many faithful fans.The same is true about the Cylons' plan.  The Plan tried to explain something that should either have been revealed to the audience around the beginning of Season Two (if a plan really existed at that point), or it should have remained a mystery.The reality is that there really was not a plan.  The plot evolved based on an intricate dance between the producers, the writers, and the fan base.  That is Good Thing(tm).  Trying to do a redaction at the end of the series to make the inconsistences appear to be planned is a Bad Thing(tm).The Plan tried to say that the entire Cylon ""skin job"" world was falling apart from the first episode based on their huge moral qualms.  The ambiguity seems to have been inserted post facto.The new footage with the old characters had them showing prophetic insights that simply were not there in the series.Also Cylon John was everywhere in the Plan, and that just did not make any sense.  In the series, Cylon Sharon had seemed genuinely confused about what she was doing leading to interesting ""nature vs nuture"" questions.  In the Plan, she is getting direction from Cylon John.  There was never any real confusion.For those that watched the whole series, the Plan feels like the discussions that the fan base used to have about Star Trek, the original series, or the original 1980s vintage Star Wars movies.  If the fanboys had been able to do a Star Trek movie, it would have felt like the Plan.Is it worth watching?I would have to say 50/50 if you are a hard-core fan, and absolutely not if you were either a casual viewer or non-viewer of the series.In service,Rich",2,Not up to the standards set by the series,1321228800,"11 14, 2011",2011,2784,"['give', 'lot', 'credit', 'BSG', 'franchise.The', 'series', 'one', 'biggest', 'best', 'science', 'fiction', 'series', 'ever', 'be', 'produced.The', 'acting', 'was', 'outstanding', 'direction', 'was', 'fantastic', 'story-line', 'was', 'generally', 'engaging.All', 'said', 'Plan', 'was', 'more', 'bit', 'let-down.If', 'are', 'hard-core', 'BSG', 'fan', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'disappointed', 'lack', 'consistency', 'lack', 'follow-through', 'Plan', 'never', 'watched', 'series', 'only', 'watched', 'pieces', 'then', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'confused', 'disappointed.There', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'plan', 'Plan', 'did', 'not', 'explain', 'why', 'fertility', 'clinics', 'New', 'Caprica.The', 'fan', 'base', 'realized', 'series', 'evolved', 'time', 'went', 'fan', 'base', 'had', 'significant', 'impact', 'plot', 'direction', 'importance', 'various', 'characters', 'pod', 'casts', 'production', 'crew', 'explained', 'how', 'critical', 'characters', 'were', 'actually', 'designed', 'originally', 'be', 'side', 'characters.Bravo', 'writers', 'producers', 'using', 'fan', 'feedback.But', 'sometimes', 'less', 'more', 'When', 'Lucas', 'tried', 'explain', 'origins', 'Force', 'sub-cellular', 'additions', 'ruined', 'concept', 'many', 'faithful', 'fans.The', 'same', 'true', 'Cylons', 'plan', 'Plan', 'tried', 'explain', 'something', 'should', 'either', 'have', 'been', 'revealed', 'audience', 'beginning', 'Season', 'Two', 'plan', 'really', 'existed', 'point', 'should', 'have', 'remained', 'mystery.The', 'reality', 'really', 'was', 'not', 'plan', 'plot', 'evolved', 'based', 'intricate', 'dance', 'producers', 'writers', 'fan', 'base', 'Good', 'Thing', 'tm', 'Trying', 'do', 'redaction', 'end', 'series', 'make', 'inconsistences', 'appear', 'be', 'planned', 'Bad', 'Thing', 'tm', '.The', 'Plan', 'tried', 'say', 'entire', 'Cylon', 'skin', 'job', 'world', 'was', 'falling', 'apart', 'first', 'episode', 'based', 'huge', 'moral', 'qualms', 'ambiguity', 'have', 'been', 'inserted', 'post', 'facto.The', 'new', 'footage', 'old', 'characters', 'had', 'showing', 'prophetic', 'insights', 'simply', 'were', 'not', 'there', 'series.Also', 'Cylon', 'John', 'was', 'everywhere', 'Plan', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'make', 'sense', 'series', 'Cylon', 'Sharon', 'had', 'seemed', 'genuinely', 'confused', 'what', 'was', 'doing', 'leading', 'interesting', 'nature', 'vs', 'nuture', 'questions', 'Plan', 'getting', 'direction', 'Cylon', 'John', 'was', 'never', 'real', 'confusion.For', 'watched', 'whole', 'series', 'Plan', 'feels', 'discussions', 'fan', 'base', 'used', 'have', 'Star', 'Trek', 'original', 'series', 'original', '1980s', 'vintage', 'Star', 'Wars', 'movies', 'fanboys', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'do', 'Star', 'Trek', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'felt', 'Plan.Is', 'worth', 'watching', 'would', 'have', 'say', '50/50', 'are', 'hard-core', 'fan', 'absolutely', 'not', 'were', 'casual', 'viewer', 'non-viewer', 'series.In', 'service', 'Rich']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

Kudos to director EJ Olmos and writer Jane Espenson for seamlessly threading in the new scenes and better fleshing out previously thin characters.Mysteries such as the following are explored...- Who did Caprica-Six meet with on Caprica, after talking with Gaius Baltar in the marketplace?- Did Boomer really blow up the water tanks?- How did Shelly Godfrey escape from the Galactica?- How did Sam Anders and his Pyramid team escape and form their resistance?- How did Ellen Tigh survive the Cylon nuclear attack on Picon?- How did Leoben become so enamored of Starbuck?- Why did the Cylons suddenly stop their attack when the BSG Marines linked up with Sam's resistance on Caprica?We also get to see more of Boomer's internal conflicts between Cylon and human facets, as well as a deeper insight into the Number Four model, Simon.  A Simon model is shown to be sympathetic to the human cause, even marrying a human (played by EJ Olmos' actual wife) and raising a family.  We see Cavil's machinations as he attempts to orchestrate several Cylons into causing massive damage to the Fleet.The computer graphics for TP are vastly superior to the shots used during the TV series, and the viewers are shown some scenes from the Cylon attack on the Colonies.  Interestingly, TP also has a graphic sex scene, as well as graphic male and female frontal nudity not unlike the infamous scene from Starship Troopers.  Some of the nudity felt rather gratuitous and excessive; was it really necessary to show Ellen Tigh and Cavil meeting in a topless bar?Minus 1-star because President Roslin, aka Mary McDonnell, and Number Three, aka Lucy Lawless, are never shown, either in a flashback or inserted new footage!  Starbuck, Lee Adama, Dr. Baltar, and Helo are shown in clips, but no new footage from them either.All in all, a very good pickup for any BSG fan.  EJ Olmos has said that if TP sells well, then we can expect to see even more BSG movies in the future.  Other potential story lines might include the origins of the Final Five, what happened to the survivors after they reached Earth, or more about Starbuck's character, especially her fateful mission where she ""died"".  TP makes you wish SciFi (aka SyFy) didn't end BSG so soon.**A quick word about the Blu-Ray discs; the image quality is solid.  The DTS soundtrack sounds great, especially in the Cylon Attack scenes.  It's a treat to hear Bear McCreary's music again.Other features; commentary by director EJ Olmos and writer Jane Espenson, 15 minutes worth of deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes look at EJ Olmos' directorial BSG debut, twenty minute visual effects feature, a cylon primer, and a short with Michael Trucco discussing a human resistance attack.",4,Much better than BSG Razor,1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,3284,"['being', 'huge', 'BSG', 'fan', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'looking', 'forward', 'BSG', 'Plan', 'BSG', 'Razor', 'failed', 'impress', 'was', ""n't"", 'expecting', 'much', 'Plan', 'Fear', 'not', 'Plan', 'hereinafter', 'referred', 'TP', 'actually', 'filler', 'episode', 'exploring', 'various', 'mysteries', 'writers', 'never', 'fully', 'explained', 'viewers', 'TP', 'chronological', 'order', 'beginning', 'Cylon', 'attack', 'going', '33', 'Water', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Home', 'Again', 'Litmus', 'Six', 'Degrees', 'Separation', 'ending', 'season', '2', 'finale', 'Lay', 'Down', 'Your', 'Burdens', 'Part', 'II', 'Kudos', 'director', 'EJ', 'Olmos', 'writer', 'Jane', 'Espenson', 'seamlessly', 'threading', 'new', 'scenes', 'better', 'fleshing', 'out', 'previously', 'thin', 'characters.Mysteries', 'such', 'following', 'are', 'explored', 'Who', 'did', 'Caprica-Six', 'meet', 'Caprica', 'talking', 'Gaius', 'Baltar', 'marketplace', 'Did', 'Boomer', 'really', 'blow', 'up', 'water', 'tanks', 'How', 'did', 'Shelly', 'Godfrey', 'escape', 'Galactica', 'How', 'did', 'Sam', 'Anders', 'Pyramid', 'team', 'escape', 'form', 'resistance', 'How', 'did', 'Ellen', 'Tigh', 'survive', 'Cylon', 'nuclear', 'attack', 'Picon', 'How', 'did', 'Leoben', 'become', 'so', 'enamored', 'Starbuck', 'Why', 'did', 'Cylons', 'suddenly', 'stop', 'attack', 'when', 'BSG', 'Marines', 'linked', 'up', 'Sam', 'resistance', 'Caprica', 'also', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Boomer', 'internal', 'conflicts', 'Cylon', 'human', 'facets', 'as', 'well', 'deeper', 'insight', 'Number', 'Four', 'model', 'Simon', 'A', 'Simon', 'model', 'shown', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'human', 'cause', 'even', 'marrying', 'human', 'played', 'EJ', 'Olmos', 'actual', 'wife', 'raising', 'family', 'see', 'Cavil', 'machinations', 'orchestrate', 'several', 'Cylons', 'causing', 'massive', 'damage', 'Fleet.The', 'computer', 'graphics', 'TP', 'are', 'vastly', 'superior', 'shots', 'used', 'TV', 'series', 'viewers', 'are', 'shown', 'scenes', 'Cylon', 'attack', 'Colonies', 'Interestingly', 'TP', 'also', 'graphic', 'sex', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'graphic', 'male', 'female', 'frontal', 'nudity', 'not', 'infamous', 'scene', 'Starship', 'Troopers', 'nudity', 'felt', 'rather', 'gratuitous', 'excessive', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'show', 'Ellen', 'Tigh', 'Cavil', 'meeting', 'topless', 'bar', '1-star', 'President', 'Roslin', 'aka', 'Mary', 'McDonnell', 'Number', 'Three', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'are', 'never', 'shown', 'either', 'flashback', 'inserted', 'new', 'footage', 'Starbuck', 'Lee', 'Adama', 'Dr.', 'Baltar', 'Helo', 'are', 'shown', 'clips', 'new', 'footage', 'either.All', 'very', 'good', 'pickup', 'BSG', 'fan', 'EJ', 'Olmos', 'said', 'TP', 'well', 'then', 'can', 'expect', 'see', 'even', 'more', 'BSG', 'movies', 'future', 'Other', 'potential', 'story', 'lines', 'might', 'include', 'origins', 'Final', 'Five', 'what', 'happened', 'survivors', 'reached', 'Earth', 'more', 'Starbuck', 'character', 'especially', 'fateful', 'mission', 'where', 'died', 'TP', 'wish', 'SciFi', 'SyFy', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'BSG', 'so', 'soon', '**A', 'quick', 'word', 'Blu-Ray', 'discs', 'image', 'quality', 'solid', 'DTS', 'soundtrack', 'great', 'especially', 'Cylon', 'Attack', 'scenes', 'treat', 'hear', 'Bear', 'McCreary', 'music', 'again.Other', 'features', 'commentary', 'director', 'EJ', 'Olmos', 'writer', 'Jane', 'Espenson', '15', 'minutes', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'EJ', 'Olmos', 'directorial', 'BSG', 'debut', 'twenty', 'minute', 'visual', 'effects', 'feature', 'cylon', 'primer', 'short', 'Michael', 'Trucco', 'discussing', 'human', 'resistance', 'attack']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan
1268871,ADIZMDZ6AXFNW,B002HRF68A,"Seor Spook ""Spooky B""","[3, 5]","For the most part, Battlestar Galactica: The Plan satisfies many expectations while simultaneously disappointing in other areas. Prior to its release, fans had been given some general idea as to what this two-hour special would be about: that it would somehow concern the five final cylons and the participation of the cylons designated as Number One -- or the ""Brother Cavils"" -- in the destruction of the twelve colonies of man as seen in the inaugural miniseries at the start ofBattlestar Galactica  - Season One.The Final Five are, indeed, very much present and accounted for. As viewers, we are treated to a much more graphic nuclear apocalypse than we'd seen before, portrayed with greater scope as we witness glimpses of the destruction on each of the twelve colonies. We learn a great deal more about the ""Brother Cavils"" and their role in the attack and subsequent events. Most gratifyingly, we finally bond with a Number Four cylon -- a ""Simon"" model -- as it (or rather, he) struggles to reconcile his malevolent machine nature with his newfound love for his very human family. Likewise, Samuel Anders' backstory is fleshed out in greater detail. All to the good, as they say.Not so good is the exclusion of a more in-depth portrayal of the Final Five's history and their role in cylon culture; a tantalizing plot point mentioned during the series that remains unexplored here. Likewise, the inclusion of generous quantities of stock footage from previous episodes mainly serves to make this film a rather tedious watch for those of us who've seen all this before, however well integrated it may be. Overall, it's as close to a ""collection of clips"" episode as this series has ever come; something that cannot be allowed to occur again if the series is ever to be revisited in future installments. Furthermore, the Region 1 disc release represents yet another missed opportunity to include the 10-part ""The Face of the Enemy"" Web shorts in either Blu-ray or DVD format.As it stands, Battlestar Galactica: The Plan is a fitfully satisfying and somewhat uneven addition to the reimagined show's cannon.

No. But it's quite good.BEWARE--some spoilers are sprinkled throughout this review.If you like Dean Stockwell as Brother Cavil (or Cylon #1), you'll like ""The Plan."" He's the main character(s). He's acerbic, witty, devious, murderous, etc. In short, all the reasons why he's my favorite Cylon. All the Cylons, except for Lucy Lawless, are in the film and most of the original Cylons play multiple roles. Most of the Human cast only appears, like Lucy Lawless, in stock footage from the series--other than Edward James Olmos, who directed the film. They give Simon the Cylon much more to do in the film than he ever did on the show, except in that one season two episode ""The Farm.""The Plan takes place both before and after the 12 colonies are wiped out. Half the story takes place on Caprica, with Sam Anders and the resistance, and the other half takes place with the infiltrating Cylons among the fleet. But ""The Plan"" ends before settlement on New Caprica at the end of season two.Normally, I don't care for the all too prevalent sci-fi gimmick of re-telling ""behind the scenes"" stories that parallel a work of good fiction, whether written or filmed. In this case, the BSG folk are telling us stuff that makes good sense (for the most part) and adds to, rather than distracting from, the series as a whole. Some of it is a bit silly--like how Shelly Godfrey (Six) evades capture after trying to discredit Baltar. Some of it is tragic--like Boomer wrestling with her ""humanity.""Could ""The Plan"" have covered more ground? Absolutely. One place they fall short is in the aftermath of the episode Anders spent with the ""war hero"" Cylons on Caprica near the end of season 2. Some of that is covered in the deleted scenes, however.One thing I was expecting and didn't get was some sort of closure about Starbuck. Or at least some small bit of information more than what we have already. No dice. So we still don't know if she was an ""angel"" or a Cylon or the daughter of a Cylon, etc.Since in some of the promotional materials I've seen, executive producer Ron Moore blames and berates executive producer David Eick for coming up with the line about the Cylons having a ""plan"" shown in the opening montage each week, and he says he'll never forgive him for it because it was so cheesy. So you can tell both of them didn't really have a plan either. And, as it turns out, neither did the Cylons.The ""plan"" of the Cylons was to destroy humanity, by any means necessary--which was rather obvious all along. But the lack of a capital P ""plan"" doesn't really detract from the story. And Cavil always has a plan. Or several. Yet what puzzled me was there was no overt mention of the Cylon's human-Cylon breeding program, which seemed to be an important ""plan"" to them at one point in the show, until Hera's birth.If you want a spoiler, here it is. Despite Lucy Lawless seeming to be in charge of the Cylons as D'Anna (or Cylon #3) in the series, Cavil is the puppet master behind the destruction of humanity. And he was responsible for most of the Cylon plots that bedeviled the fleet in the first two seasons of BSG. Given his character, I found this totally believable. And having no Lucy Lawless around for this new film made it that much easier for Cavil to shine. Cavil could definitely give the nefarious Ben from ""Lost"" a run for his money.",4,"""The Plan"" is good--but also leaves you wanting more",1256860800,"10 30, 2009",2009,3465,"['are', 'dedicated', 'current', 'era', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'fan', 'think', 'are', 'going', 'enjoy', 'BSG', 'Plan', 'perfect', 'No', 'quite', 'good.BEWARE', 'spoilers', 'are', 'sprinkled', 'review.If', 'Dean', 'Stockwell', 'Brother', 'Cavil', 'Cylon', '1', ""'ll"", 'like', 'Plan', 'main', 'character', 's', 'acerbic', 'witty', 'devious', 'murderous', 'etc', 'short', 'reasons', 'why', 'favorite', 'Cylon', 'Cylons', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'are', 'film', 'most', 'original', 'Cylons', 'play', 'multiple', 'roles', 'Most', 'Human', 'cast', 'only', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'stock', 'footage', 'series', 'other', 'Edward', 'James', 'Olmos', 'who', 'directed', 'film', 'give', 'Cylon', 'much', 'more', 'do', 'film', 'ever', 'did', 'show', 'one', 'season', 'two', 'episode', 'Farm', 'Plan', 'place', '12', 'colonies', 'are', 'wiped', 'out', 'story', 'place', 'Caprica', 'Sam', 'Anders', 'resistance', 'other', 'half', 'place', 'infiltrating', 'Cylons', 'fleet', 'Plan', 'before', 'settlement', 'New', 'Caprica', 'end', 'season', 'two.Normally', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'too', 'prevalent', 'sci-fi', 'gimmick', 're-telling', 'scenes', 'stories', 'parallel', 'work', 'good', 'fiction', 'written', 'filmed', 'case', 'BSG', 'folk', 'are', 'telling', 'stuff', 'good', 'sense', 'most', 'part', 'rather', 'distracting', 'series', 'whole', 'bit', 'silly', 'how', 'Shelly', 'Godfrey', 'Six', 'capture', 'trying', 'discredit', 'Baltar', 'tragic', 'Boomer', 'wrestling', 'humanity', 'Could', 'Plan', 'have', 'covered', 'more', 'ground', 'Absolutely', 'One', 'place', 'fall', 'short', 'aftermath', 'episode', 'Anders', 'spent', 'war', 'hero', 'Cylons', 'Caprica', 'end', 'season', '2', 'covered', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'however.One', 'thing', 'was', 'expecting', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'was', 'sort', 'closure', 'Starbuck', 'least', 'small', 'bit', 'information', 'more', 'what', 'have', 'already', 'dice', 'still', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'angel', 'Cylon', 'daughter', 'Cylon', 'etc.Since', 'promotional', 'materials', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'executive', 'producer', 'Ron', 'Moore', 'blames', 'berates', 'executive', 'producer', 'David', 'Eick', 'coming', 'up', 'line', 'Cylons', 'having', 'plan', 'shown', 'opening', 'montage', 'week', ""'ll"", 'never', 'forgive', 'was', 'so', 'cheesy', 'can', 'tell', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'plan', 'either', 'out', 'neither', 'did', 'Cylons.The', 'plan', 'Cylons', 'was', 'destroy', 'humanity', 'means', 'necessary', 'was', 'rather', 'obvious', 'along', 'lack', 'capital', 'P', 'plan', ""n't"", 'really', 'detract', 'story', 'Cavil', 'always', 'plan', 'several', 'what', 'puzzled', 'was', 'was', 'overt', 'mention', 'Cylon', 'human-Cylon', 'breeding', 'program', 'seemed', 'be', 'important', 'plan', 'one', 'point', 'show', 'Hera', 'birth.If', 'want', 'spoiler', 'here', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'seeming', 'be', 'charge', 'Cylons', ""D'Anna"", 'Cylon', '3', 'series', 'Cavil', 'puppet', 'master', 'destruction', 'humanity', 'was', 'responsible', 'most', 'Cylon', 'plots', 'bedeviled', 'fleet', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'BSG', 'Given', 'character', 'found', 'totally', 'believable', 'having', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'new', 'film', 'made', 'much', 'easier', 'Cavil', 'shine', 'Cavil', 'could', 'definitely', 'give', 'nefarious', 'Ben', 'Lost', 'run', 'money']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan

I felt like I walked into the middle of a film with the characters already introduced. Not as bad as ""Final Fantasy VII"" movie lack of character introduction, but darn close.I never really grasped why Cylons needed planets and didn't just destroy them. Why were their nuclear weapons so puny? Didn't we make them with an off switch? The movie bounced around a lot and I had to figure out who was real, who were Cylons and why would they care they were once ""enslaved"" robots. The movie has far too much dialogue and not enough action. The colony planets all had names with some kind of zodiac sign associated with it, although I don't know why. If these are all colonies, what happened to earth? If you are going to have gratuitous nudity, what is wrong with Tricia Helfer?After the earth colony planets are poorly nuked, Cylons for some reason occupy the planet Caprica so humans, inspired by Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen (Red Dawn), attack the Cylons, although not often enough to make for some exciting action.

Once they became like us, they wanted to destroy us.  From our perspective, we have Galactica, from their perspective, we have The Plan.  Truly frightening and though provoking, this production opens up topics and discussions that have make their way into the United Nations.One exceptional touch is the simultaneous events followed onscreen.  As Dean Stockwell, in his dual roles as Brother Caviel in space, and the Priest on planet sees the Plan unveil, each has a different reaction and rationale.  Cylon or not, some of 'them' value humanity.Like Caprica and the shocking last scene, the Plan is equally enthralling.Who ever thought that a Glen Larson production would lead to this?  Pa Cartright, Lorne Greene, would be pleased.The DVD includes a whole variety of features.  There is the uncensored 90 minute production, interactive features (blu-ray), a trivia game, bookmarks, interfviews, cylons on attack,and film maker commentary.The Plan is outstanding drama, no matter what genre you enjoy.

I'm not sure if there are any differences between that version of The Plan and this one. I have only watched The Plan so far so I will only comment on that movie. I thought this was a nice summary of the series. I had a friend that was a BSG fanatic tell me one time that he was hoping the cylons would win the war and kill the humans. His reasoning seemed to be that we are imperfect and should be shown the error of our ways. So I am surprised that he didn't see the imperfections in the cylons too. The Plan spells it out rather plainly for all to see. In many ways they were just as messed up but lovable as we are.That said, what did irritate me was the quality of the bluray video. It was terribly grainy in many scenes. Probably around 40% of the movie. It was only $8.99 for the combo. I am left feeling that they didn't care too much about this release and didn't want to invest any time or money in making it the best it could be. If it had been pristine I would have been a lot more impressed with the production company. I don't see any reason for the poor quality. Both movies, The Plan and The Razor, were on separate disks so I doubt they were running out of space on the disk. This version may not have the quality problems.

1268890,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B002HRF68A,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[9, 9]","""Battlestar Galatica: The Plan"" has an ambitious agenda; it's designed to show us all of the things that the Cylons did to destroy and track the fleet from how Boomer was ""activated"", why Leoben developed an obsession with Starbuck to how one of the ships was boarded by the Cylons, to why one of the 5's was strapped with explosives and tries to blow up the BG. It fills in the various cracks that the series never had an opportunity to fill us in on--the ""plan"" that Cylon Brother Cavil (Dean Stockwell) launched once he was aboard the Galatica. The good news is that it answers many of the questions fans had as to how the Galatica was found so easily, why Number 6 tried to discredit Baltar at one point, etc. but because it focuses on these tiny back stories, the film doesn't quite hold together as a narrative jumping through the series four years.Director and actor Edward James Olmos (Commander Adama)does solid job of integrating pre-existing footage from various episodes and seamlessly blending them in with the new footage that gives us the operrational plan that the Cylons used to try and destroy humanity before realizing that they might be misguided. Unfortunately, he's trapped by the structure and plots of the various episodes that these vinettes are designed to enlighten us about. In many respects, this movie would have played better as webisodes similar to ""Face of the Enemy"" (and why that isn't on here since it does let us see the stories that fall between the cracks of various episodes were resolved is beyond me. I suspect that Universal will put out yet another disc for fans to buy). The script by Jane Espenson (she wrote ""Face of the Enemy"" webisodes which makes sense when you see ""The Plan"" as well as being a regular writer on ""Dollhouse"" and ""Tru Calling"")is certainly flawed as it is dependent on knowing the episodes in the series and the outcomes to make sense of them (my wife watched the show and I had to explain what was going on and why because she doesn't seen all of the episodes of the series). As a result, it doesn't hold up as a TV movie much less a direct-to-DVD (or Blu-ray in this case)movie either. It probably should have been released as a bonus disc on ""The Complete Series"" but wasn't ready by the street date of the set).Still, it is worth watching for fans of the series and for newbies I'd suggest starting from the first episode and working your way through the last and THEN watching this becuae it doesn't hold together as well as ""Razor"" or even some of the webisodes.Image quality is spectacular with some truly stunning visual effects sequences that shows us the destruction of Caprica. This is probably one of the best looking discs for the show simply because it's a two hour movie and some change (in the form of extras)on a BD 50 disc whereas the series usually had anywhere from three to four episodes per disc. Clarity is remarkably sharp and colors pop. The show deliberately looks grainy and it's not going to be as brilliant looking as, say, ""Braveheart"" because of the gritty look of the show but it looks exceptionally good.Extras include ""From Admiral to Director"" a behind-the-scenes glimpse at Olmos' turn in the director's chair for a two hour TV movie. ""The Cylons of the Plan"", ""The Cylon Attack"" and ""Visual Effects: The Magic Behind 'The Plan'"" takes us behind-the-scenes into everything from the writing/planning of the episode to the post-production visual effects used to portray the destruction of Caprica. We also get deleted scenes and a commentary track with Olmos and writer/producer Espenson.There's also BD-Live material connectivity an exclusive ""Battlestar Galatica"" trivia challenge for the Blu-ray only.Flawed precisely because it tells us the behind-the-scenes stories that were portrayed in the series thus making it episodic and hard to follow for newbies, ""Battlestar Galatica: The Plan"" doesn't hold together the way ""Razor"" did (where you could watch the two hour movie without having seen most of the series and make sense of things)nor does it hold togethre as well as the individual webisodes of ""Face of the Enemy"" but it's a nice addition for fans. It's clear after this though that Universal has milked the ""Battlestar Galatica"" franchise dry for this segment of the story.

That was it? I was dragged thru an emotional roller-coaster again only to be told the ride is over at the top of the track.This DVD encompasses all that was good and bad about BSG.The characters and the character moments sparkle. The dialogue and the acting is first-rate and evoked my fond memories of the series. The problem is, like the series, that's all this really is... a series of character moments (and most pulled from the old episodes). There is no real story here. Like the series, you get to the end and want to say ""Is that it?"". Yeah, I know the BSG creators lamely used the excuse that the show was always meant to just be about the characters, but c'mon, that is just a poor excuse for lazy, lazy writing. I had hoped and half-way expected this DVD was the show's runners' way of after-the-fact filling in the plot holes for the series, but instead it's just another opportunity squandered.Nevertheless, you will probably want to buy this DVD if you were more than a casual fan of the show. Understand that it is in essence a ""clip-show"" interspersed with a good number of fresh scenes that enhance and expand on the older fare but really add nothing much to any kind of story arc.Bottom-line: Good, but could have been so much more...",3,A disappointing pleasure,1258329600,"11 16, 2009",2009,1664,"['do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'else', 'describe', 'reaction', 'DVD.I', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'recapturing', 'same', 'sense', 'anticipation', 'recalled', 'early', 'seasons', 'BSG', 'enjoying', 'character', 'moments', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'deduce', 'what', 'exactly', 'was', 'Cylon', 'plan', 'were', 'teased', 'show', 'opening', 'week.But', 'end', 'DVD', 'experienced', 'same', 'let', 'down', 'series', 'finale', 'was', 'was', 'dragged', 'emotional', 'roller-coaster', 'again', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'ride', 'top', 'track.This', 'DVD', 'was', 'good', 'bad', 'BSG.The', 'characters', 'character', 'moments', 'sparkle', 'dialogue', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'evoked', 'fond', 'memories', 'series', 'problem', 'series', 'really', 'series', 'character', 'moments', 'most', 'pulled', 'old', 'episodes', 'real', 'story', 'here', 'series', 'get', 'end', 'want', 'say', 'Yeah', 'know', 'BSG', 'creators', 'lamely', 'used', 'excuse', 'show', 'was', 'always', 'meant', 'just', 'be', 'characters', ""c'mon"", 'just', 'poor', 'excuse', 'lazy', 'lazy', 'writing', 'had', 'hoped', 'half-way', 'expected', 'DVD', 'was', 'show', 'runners', 'way', 'after-the-fact', 'filling', 'plot', 'holes', 'series', 'instead', 'just', 'opportunity', 'squandered.Nevertheless', 'will', 'probably', 'want', 'buy', 'DVD', 'were', 'more', 'casual', 'fan', 'show', 'Understand', 'essence', 'clip-show', 'interspersed', 'good', 'number', 'fresh', 'scenes', 'enhance', 'expand', 'older', 'fare', 'really', 'add', 'nothing', 'much', 'kind', 'story', 'arc.Bottom-line', 'Good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'more']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan
1268893,AP3B615GM191G,B002HRF68A,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[2, 2]","After the brilliant finale to Battlestar Galactica, I had mixed feelings about watching its addendum ""The Plan"".  On one hand, I wanted another couple hours of watching ""the old gang"" again.  On the other, though, the ending was so great that I didn't want it to be tarnished in any form.  Ultimately, while ""The Plan"" doesn't specifically take away from the incredible run of BSG, it also doesn't add anything interesting to the overall story, either.Basically, ""The Plan"" is the BSG writers' way of covering their collective butts because of the whole ""Cylons have a plan"" quote referenced in the opening titles.  That plan was never really expanded upon during the run of the show, so this little film tries to flesh out the Cylon point of view.The trouble, however, is that ""The Plan"" amounts to little more than minutiae in the background of an incredible show.  BSG is such a big-concept show that all the ""background stuff"" just doesn't really have a place in the cannon.  It doesn't help that, in ""The Plan"", the Cylons are reduced to little more than guerrilla warriors after their initial attack fails to wipe out all of humanity.  As such, the character-development in this installment is pitiful compared to the human-Cylon relations during the series.The only reason I can give this set a two-star rating is that, on a couple of occasions, it gives some insight into why an event happened or what a character was thinking.  Sadly, those moments are few and far between.Overall, then, I can even go so far as to say that ""The Plan"" is not at all required watching for BSG fans.  Most fans will watch because they can't get enough, but at no time does ""The Plan"" offer any plots, character development, action, or storyline that even remotely resemble the emotion and splendor of the BSG series.  It is kind of sad that this dud will be the last taste of BSG that viewers will get.  Thus, unless you can't help yourself, skip ""The Plan"" and continue to bask in the greatest of the regular series airing and its incredible finale.",2,Too Much Minutiae For Such A Concept-Driven Show,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,2040,"['brilliant', 'finale', 'Battlestar', 'Galactica', 'had', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'watching', 'addendum', 'Plan', 'one', 'hand', 'wanted', 'couple', 'hours', 'watching', 'old', 'gang', 'again', 'other', 'ending', 'was', 'so', 'great', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'tarnished', 'form', 'Ultimately', 'Plan', ""n't"", 'specifically', 'take', 'away', 'incredible', 'run', 'BSG', 'also', ""n't"", 'add', 'anything', 'interesting', 'overall', 'story', 'either.Basically', 'Plan', 'BSG', 'writers', 'way', 'covering', 'collective', 'butts', 'whole', 'Cylons', 'have', 'plan', 'quote', 'referenced', 'opening', 'titles', 'plan', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'expanded', 'upon', 'run', 'show', 'little', 'film', 'tries', 'flesh', 'out', 'Cylon', 'point', 'view.The', 'trouble', 'however', 'Plan', 'amounts', 'little', 'more', 'minutiae', 'background', 'incredible', 'show', 'BSG', 'such', 'big-concept', 'show', 'background', 'stuff', 'just', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'place', 'cannon', ""n't"", 'help', 'Plan', 'Cylons', 'are', 'reduced', 'little', 'more', 'guerrilla', 'warriors', 'initial', 'attack', 'wipe', 'out', 'humanity', 'such', 'character-development', 'installment', 'pitiful', 'compared', 'human-Cylon', 'relations', 'series.The', 'only', 'reason', 'can', 'give', 'set', 'two-star', 'rating', 'couple', 'occasions', 'insight', 'why', 'event', 'happened', 'what', 'character', 'was', 'thinking', 'Sadly', 'moments', 'are', 'few', 'far', 'between.Overall', 'then', 'can', 'even', 'go', 'so', 'far', 'say', 'Plan', 'not', 'required', 'watching', 'BSG', 'fans', 'Most', 'fans', 'will', 'watch', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'time', 'Plan', 'offer', 'plots', 'character', 'development', 'action', 'storyline', 'even', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'emotion', 'splendor', 'BSG', 'series', 'kind', 'sad', 'dud', 'will', 'be', 'last', 'taste', 'BSG', 'viewers', 'will', 'get', 'Thus', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'Plan', 'continue', 'bask', 'greatest', 'regular', 'series', 'airing', 'incredible', 'finale']",Battlestar Galactica: The Plan
