Once my boy eagerly pointed out the Star Wars theme of the DVD cover, I ordered it without looking further, believing that it was a Star Wars take off such as Family Guy has made.  My mistake and only have myself to blame for being in such a rush.  It is being returned unopened.

886390,A1ELM0GEXEAM79,B0007PAM24,"Christopher P. Cecena ""ssjanifan""","[10, 20]","This is probably the first real ""Classic Simpsons"" disk that has come out.  The other singles have mostly been about the more recent, not to mention far less funny and at times insulting, seasons.  There are four episodes.  The first one is Dog of Death.  In it Santa's Little Helper is deathly ill and the family has to make great sacrifices to afford for the operation to save him.  But as a result they are all angry at the mutt, who then runs away and gets abducted by Mr. Burns.  A good episode, although it's already on the 3rd season collection.  Luckily, the other three episodes haven't been released yet.  First off is Marge Be Not Proud, a charming X-mas episode, which for some reason wasn't even included on either Christmas DVD, where Bart shoplifts a video game.  We see Bart actually feel guilty in this episode, giving him a very nice touch of characterization, something the later episodes are extremely lacking in.  The Secret War of Lisa Simpson sees the Simpson kids enrolled in a military school.  Although Bart is soon accepted by the other kids, Lisa is shunned.  Lisa becomes more depressed and alone, and eventually Bart's the only one who gives her any kind of support.  The final episode, Mayored to the Mob, was from the 10th season, which is when the series started to veer from the sitcom status to more of the Family Guy rip-off style it has become nowadays.  As a result, it's the weakest in the set, however, it is still more entertaining than some of the other than, say, all the episodes on the 2nd Christmas DVD.  In it, Homer becomes a bodyguard for Mayor Quimby, who is soon targeted by Fat Tony(brilliantly voiced by Joe Mantegna).  Mark Hamill guest stars as himself and a few additional voices.  All in all, it's a flawed set, but it seems to be the first one of the single disks headed in the right track.",4,The first good single disc release.,1112140800,"03 30, 2005",2005,1848,"['probably', 'first', 'real', 'Classic', 'Simpsons', 'disk', 'come', 'out', 'other', 'singles', 'have', 'mostly', 'been', 'more', 'recent', 'not', 'mention', 'far', 'less', 'funny', 'times', 'insulting', 'seasons', 'are', 'four', 'episodes', 'first', 'one', 'Dog', 'Death', 'Santa', 'Little', 'Helper', 'deathly', 'ill', 'family', 'make', 'great', 'sacrifices', 'afford', 'operation', 'save', 'result', 'are', 'angry', 'mutt', 'who', 'then', 'away', 'abducted', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'good', 'episode', 'already', '3rd', 'season', 'collection', 'Luckily', 'other', 'three', 'episodes', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'released', 'yet', 'First', 'off', 'Marge', 'Be', 'Not', 'Proud', 'charming', 'X-mas', 'episode', 'reason', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'included', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'where', 'Bart', 'video', 'game', 'see', 'Bart', 'actually', 'feel', 'guilty', 'episode', 'giving', 'very', 'nice', 'touch', 'characterization', 'something', 'later', 'episodes', 'are', 'extremely', 'lacking', 'Secret', 'War', 'Lisa', 'Simpson', 'Simpson', 'kids', 'enrolled', 'military', 'school', 'Bart', 'soon', 'accepted', 'other', 'kids', 'Lisa', 'shunned', 'Lisa', 'more', 'depressed', 'alone', 'eventually', 'Bart', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'kind', 'support', 'final', 'episode', 'Mayored', 'Mob', 'was', '10th', 'season', 'when', 'series', 'started', 'veer', 'sitcom', 'status', 'more', 'Family', 'Guy', 'rip-off', 'style', 'become', 'nowadays', 'result', 'weakest', 'set', 'however', 'still', 'more', 'entertaining', 'other', 'say', 'episodes', '2nd', 'Christmas', 'DVD', 'Homer', 'bodyguard', 'Mayor', 'Quimby', 'who', 'soon', 'targeted', 'Fat', 'Tony', 'brilliantly', 'voiced', 'Joe', 'Mantegna', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'guest', 'stars', 'few', 'additional', 'voices', 'flawed', 'set', 'be', 'first', 'one', 'single', 'disks', 'headed', 'right', 'track']",The Simpsons - Bart Wars

The episodes are Dog of Death, Marge Be Not Proud, The Secret War Of Lisa Simpson, and Mayored To The Mob. For those who can't wait for all those sets or who just like the convenience of these theme compilations, this may be worth the modest price of roughly $10 to $11. However, even for that money you'd think there would be a few more episodes on these discs. After all, without commercials each show only runs about 22 to 23 minutes. Then there is the cheesy marketing ploy of using the current Star Wars Episode III fever sweeping the nation to market this collection, which has only one episode in it with any real connection to or parody of Star Wars. Note that The Simpsons is a Fox show and Star Wars is a Fox film release; this DVD's title is just a blatant attempt to cross-market two products owned by the same company. Notice that the DVD's release date is just two days before Star Wars Episode III opens in movie theaters.There are fun episodes on this DVD, but these 4-episode releases are of dubious value given their short running time, lack of extra features and the fact that the episodes are being released on the full season sets.

886405,A2I2HDCI4LJYNU,B0007PAM24,"voodoochild ""random person""","[5, 10]","Don't take this one star review the wrong way. I love the Simpsons, it's probably my favorite next to Monty Python. A scale for comedy shouled be measured by how below other shows are then these. But why does Fox have to keep sending out these single disc dvd's some of which have already been realesed, and some of recent series which have very much lost there quality, with a few exceptions. The season 6 dvd will be out in August, but maybe if it wasn't for dvd's like this it would have been out a while ago. For example: The Simpsons Christmas dvd was pointless, because two of the episodes had already been realeased, the mr. plow one had no mention of Christmas whatsoever anyway. The the snd edition has a alternate title as well as two episodes that have vertualy nothing to do with Christmas. What's the point. Dog of Death was out a while ago, with commentary, and storyboards. This dvd has it without storyboards and commentary. What is the real point of these dvd's. I guess it's to keep our hopes up and for us to say 'Well at least they relaesed a dvd recently'. It takes a whole year for another season dvd to come out. Friends is up to like 9, and has been for a while. I can't stand that show, so why should that show stand to get much better realese time. i doubt the wi=riters and animators don't have free time everyday to record commentaries. They obviously have funn recording them. This dvd has very average episodes and not that funny, only because for a long time, the Simpsons have kept up such a high standerd of clever, well-written, and hillarious comedy.So I wish Fox would stop recording these, and I wish I could have season 9 on Dvd, before I graduate High School.",1,Why-oWhy fox?,1111104000,"03 18, 2005",2005,1698,"['Do', ""n't"", 'take', 'one', 'star', 'review', 'wrong', 'way', 'love', 'Simpsons', 'probably', 'favorite', 'next', 'Monty', 'Python', 'scale', 'comedy', 'shouled', 'be', 'measured', 'how', 'other', 'shows', 'are', 'then', 'why', 'Fox', 'have', 'keep', 'sending', 'single', 'disc', 'dvd', 'have', 'already', 'been', 'realesed', 'recent', 'series', 'have', 'very', 'much', 'lost', 'quality', 'few', 'exceptions', 'season', '6', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'out', 'August', 'maybe', 'was', ""n't"", 'dvd', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'out', 'while', 'ago', 'example', 'Simpsons', 'Christmas', 'dvd', 'was', 'pointless', 'two', 'episodes', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'realeased', 'mr.', 'plow', 'one', 'had', 'mention', 'Christmas', 'whatsoever', 'anyway', 'snd', 'edition', 'alternate', 'title', 'as', 'well', 'two', 'episodes', 'have', 'vertualy', 'nothing', 'do', 'Christmas', 'What', 'point', 'Dog', 'Death', 'was', 'out', 'while', 'ago', 'commentary', 'storyboards', 'dvd', 'storyboards', 'commentary', 'What', 'real', 'point', 'dvd', 'guess', 'keep', 'hopes', 'up', 'say', ""'Well"", 'least', 'relaesed', 'dvd', 'recently', 'whole', 'year', 'season', 'dvd', 'come', 'out', 'Friends', 'up', '9', 'been', 'while', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'show', 'so', 'why', 'should', 'show', 'stand', 'get', 'much', 'better', 'realese', 'time', 'i', 'doubt', 'wi=riters', 'animators', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'free', 'time', 'everyday', 'record', 'commentaries', 'obviously', 'have', 'funn', 'recording', 'dvd', 'very', 'average', 'episodes', 'not', 'funny', 'only', 'long', 'time', 'Simpsons', 'have', 'kept', 'up', 'such', 'high', 'standerd', 'clever', 'well-written', 'hillarious', 'comedy.So', 'wish', 'Fox', 'would', 'stop', 'recording', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'season', '9', 'Dvd', 'graduate', 'High', 'School']",The Simpsons - Bart Wars
886406,AQP1VPK16SVWM,B0007PAM24,"Wayne Klein ""If at first the idea is not absu...","[6, 9]","Pity Darth Vader. He used to represent the worst that the dark side could do. Darth Vader needs to be scared. Very Scared. Bart Simpson represents the darkest side of the force and Darth, he's going to whip your butt. The entertainment business is like ILG (the company that advertises on TV in ""The Simpsons"" as recycling the essential chemicals of your body into food stuff); it's all about recycle, recycle, recycle. The good news is that this recycled set (which has four episodes that come from the years 1992, 1995, 1997 and 1998). ""Bart Wars"", alas, isn't all tied into ""Star Wars"" but Mark Hamill DOES appear in one episode in Luke Skywalker garb. There are four delightful episodes from the series included here including the classic ""Dog of Death"" where Santa's Little Helper (Bart's dog)  must have an expensive operation. The Simpsons resent him so much afterward they sell him to Mr. Burns where SLH becomes an evil hound till Bart's love wins him back. Sigh. ""Marge Be Not Proud"" focuses on Marge's reaction when Bart shoplifts a new video game he can't afford. In ""The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"" Lisa (and Bart) join a new military school and must survive an obstacle course. In ""Mayored to the Mob""The family attends a science fiction convention where Homer saves Mark Hamill from an unruly mob.  This changes Homer's life and he decides to become a bodyguard to the Mayor. The mob is now after the Mayor. The mob is in for a very big surprise.The same masters used for the boxed sets were used for this set as well so, needless to say, the image quality is exceptionally good with bright colors, nice sharp image quality and minimal digital artifacts. The stereo surround soundtrack is pretty good as well making good use of the format. The dialogue (one of the delights of any ""Simpsons"" episode) comes across bright and clear.Although it isn't advertised on the box, there are extras with this set. The extras are drawn from the boxed set and are for the episode ""Mayored to the Mob"". We get an animatic section for the first act, an animation showcase that allows you to use the angle button to change the view from storyboards, animatic and the completed episode. Two of the options are shown as picture-in-picture in the lower left and right hand corner of the screen. It's a pity that Fox didn't do here as they did with the themed ""X-Files"" sets and include new commentary tracks or even preview an episode that hasn't aired on TV yet (much as Paramount has done with some ""SpongeBobSquarePants"" episodes).If you'd like to own just a little slice of Simpson heaven, this is a pretty good place to start. As much as I love this show, I doubt I'll be collecting every season on DVD (I'd have no place to put my other DVDs afterwards) so the fact that Fox is releasing a taste like this is good but could be improved.I'd suggest, however, that they release a highlights disc for each season consisting of 8 episodes with extras for the best two along with commentary tracks since they already have access to them. It's a great way for a casual fan to collect the series. Fox didn't have to put any extras on this one and I'm happy that they did include some.",4,"A single episode tied into ""Star Wars"" rest is very good",1118880000,"06 16, 2005",2005,3180,"['Pity', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'used', 'represent', 'worst', 'dark', 'side', 'could', 'do', 'Darth', 'Vader', 'needs', 'be', 'scared', 'Very', 'Scared', 'Bart', 'Simpson', 'darkest', 'side', 'force', 'Darth', 'going', 'whip', 'butt', 'entertainment', 'business', 'ILG', 'company', 'TV', 'Simpsons', 'recycling', 'essential', 'chemicals', 'body', 'food', 'stuff', 'recycle', 'recycle', 'recycle', 'good', 'news', 'recycled', 'set', 'four', 'episodes', 'come', 'years', '1992', '1995', '1997', '1998', 'Bart', 'Wars', 'alas', ""n't"", 'tied', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'DOES', 'appear', 'one', 'episode', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'garb', 'are', 'four', 'delightful', 'episodes', 'series', 'included', 'here', 'including', 'classic', 'Dog', 'Death', 'where', 'Santa', 'Little', 'Helper', 'Bart', 'dog', 'must', 'have', 'expensive', 'operation', 'Simpsons', 'resent', 'so', 'much', 'sell', 'Mr.', 'Burns', 'where', 'SLH', 'evil', 'hound', 'Bart', 'love', 'back', 'Sigh', 'Marge', 'Be', 'Not', 'Proud', 'Marge', 'reaction', 'when', 'Bart', 'new', 'video', 'game', 'ca', ""n't"", 'afford', 'Secret', 'War', 'Lisa', 'Simpson', 'Lisa', 'Bart', 'join', 'new', 'military', 'school', 'must', 'survive', 'obstacle', 'course', 'Mayored', 'Mob', 'family', 'science', 'fiction', 'convention', 'where', 'Homer', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'unruly', 'mob', 'Homer', 'life', 'become', 'bodyguard', 'Mayor', 'mob', 'now', 'Mayor', 'mob', 'very', 'big', 'surprise.The', 'same', 'masters', 'used', 'boxed', 'sets', 'were', 'used', 'set', 'as', 'well', 'so', 'needless', 'say', 'image', 'quality', 'exceptionally', 'good', 'bright', 'colors', 'nice', 'sharp', 'image', 'quality', 'minimal', 'digital', 'artifacts', 'stereo', 'surround', 'soundtrack', 'pretty', 'good', 'well', 'making', 'good', 'use', 'format', 'dialogue', 'one', 'delights', 'Simpsons', 'episode', 'bright', 'clear.Although', ""n't"", 'advertised', 'box', 'are', 'extras', 'set', 'extras', 'are', 'drawn', 'boxed', 'set', 'are', 'episode', 'Mayored', 'Mob', 'get', 'animatic', 'section', 'first', 'act', 'animation', 'showcase', 'use', 'angle', 'button', 'change', 'view', 'storyboards', 'animatic', 'completed', 'episode', 'Two', 'options', 'are', 'shown', 'picture-in-picture', 'lower', 'left', 'right', 'hand', 'corner', 'screen', 'pity', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'here', 'did', 'themed', 'X-Files', 'sets', 'include', 'new', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'even', 'preview', 'episode', ""n't"", 'aired', 'TV', 'yet', 'much', 'Paramount', 'done', 'SpongeBobSquarePants', 'episodes', '.If', ""'d"", 'like', 'own', 'just', 'little', 'slice', 'Simpson', 'heaven', 'pretty', 'good', 'place', 'start', 'As', 'much', 'love', 'show', 'doubt', ""'ll"", 'be', 'collecting', 'season', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'have', 'place', 'put', 'other', 'DVDs', 'afterwards', 'fact', 'Fox', 'releasing', 'taste', 'good', 'could', 'be', 'improved.I', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'however', 'release', 'highlights', 'disc', 'season', 'consisting', '8', 'episodes', 'extras', 'best', 'two', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'already', 'have', 'access', 'great', 'way', 'casual', 'fan', 'collect', 'series', 'Fox', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'put', 'extras', 'one', ""'m"", 'happy', 'did', 'include']",The Simpsons - Bart Wars
