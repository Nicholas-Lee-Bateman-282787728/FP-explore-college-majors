Luecke ""movie buff""","[7, 7]","I bought this blu-ray title an addition to my collection of the biblical epics of the fifties thru the mid 60's, such as The Robe, King of Kings, Quo Vadis etc. I first saw this movie when it premiered in NY city and was somewhat disappointed in it. It's a mixed bag of good, interesting and sincere. I think George C. Scott as Abraham is probably the best thing about the film. I also found the music by composer Toshiro Mifume to be very bland and mundane. Definetly not as uplifting a musical score by likes of Miklos Rozsa or Alfred Newman.Upon viewing the blu-ray disc, I again found the transfer to be good not great.

A half an hour could easily have been cut from this portion, and also, this is where most of the stilted dialogue can be found...but nevertheless, even though it dwindles as the film progresses, this telling of the first 22 chapters of Genesis is one I've seen numerous times, and am sure to view again.My tape is unfortunately, on the dark side, but still a visual treat at its best.",4,"visually beautiful, but it fizzles...",1036540800,"11 6, 2002",2002,1366,"['film', 'entertaining', 'many', 'levels', 'appreciate', 'good', 'art', 'direction', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'film.The', 'cinematography', 'Giuseppe', 'Rotunno', 'classical', 'score', 'Toshiro', 'Mayuzumi', 'are', 'also', 'superb.Outstanding', 'are', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'director', 'Huston', 'narrating', 'mix', 'verses', 'Genesis', 'Chapters', '1', '2', 'KJV', 'have', 'special', 'fondness', 'sprawling', 'quot', 'Tree', 'Knowledge', 'quot', 'strange', 'looking', 'white', 'favorite', 'sections', 'great', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'fabulous', 'highly', 'choreographed', 'telling', 'Cain', 'Abel', 'story.The', 'animals', 'going', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'wonderful', 'music', 'delight', 'kids', 'ages.The', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'awesome', 'ziggurat', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'looking', 'simply', 'stunning', 'exotic', 'makeup.Peter', ""O'Toole"", 'Angel', 'always', 'fascinating', 'actor', 'even', 'small', 'part', 'scene', 'stealer.Yes', 'abysmally', 'slow', 'parts', 'especially', 'final', 'Abraham', 'section', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'serious', 'editing', 'A', 'half', 'hour', 'could', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'portion', 'also', 'where', 'most', 'stilted', 'dialogue', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'nevertheless', 'even', 'film', 'telling', 'first', '22', 'chapters', 'Genesis', 'one', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'numerous', 'times', 'am', 'sure', 'view', 'again.My', 'tape', 'unfortunately', 'dark', 'side', 'still', 'visual', 'treat', 'best']",The Bible...In the Beginning VHS

These earthy and sometimes shockingly lurid tales of humankind's formative years, when the God of the desert had a temper, are a true cinematic masterpiece! There is a raw tone here that is simply absent from 21st century movies and it makes for compelling viewing. No CGI whatsoever, just physically built glorious sets, ultra-effective makeup, and strong performances by an outstanding cast who respect what in other hands could have been campy material.

418316,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6304386168,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[7, 9]","The Bible ... in the Beginning is a most interesting motion picture.  Over the course of almost three hours, the people and events of the first twenty-two chapters of the Book of Genesis are brought to life by a star-studded cast of characters under the direction of John Huston (with Dino Delaurentiis as the producer).  It is a strange film; at times it is very moving and communicative of the Biblical message, but at other times it becomes strangely surrealistic or downright comical.  It is, with a few exceptions, a pretty faithful reenactment of the Biblical text, however, and that certainly does count for something.  The film can basically be broken down into several sections: the Creation, original sin, and the first murder; Noah's flood; the tower of Babel; and the life of Abraham.The creation of the world is given a slow and sonorous treatment that tends to drag just a little bit.  Then we have the creation of Adam and Eve (although there's no mention of the whole rib business).  I found it somewhat strange to see Eve drawn to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil almost immediately - the serpent's job was made quite easy, and I must say I rather liked the manner in which the serpent was represented here.  The ejection of Adam and Eve from the Garden is pretty powerful stuff, as is the later murder of Abel by his jealous brother Cain (played by a young Richard Harris).Then comes the story of Noah and the Great Flood, which has to be my favorite part of the movie.  John Huston himself plays Noah, and it is a remarkable performance that oscillates between seriousness and downright goofiness.  The Ark is impressive and truly communicates the immense size of the thing, and one cannot but get a big kick out of seeing all the animals trot in two by two (including lions, tigers, polar bears, elephants, penguins, etc.).  I also thought the Tower of Babel was presented in an impressive fashion, and the sight of Nimrod climbing to the top in order to shoot an arrow up into the heavens was a nice touch that more than earned God's anger and resulted in the dispersal of different languages among the people.I have mixed feelings over the action surrounding Abraham.  George C. Scott is one of the greatest actors to ever live, but I'm just not sure he was a good choice to play the Hebrew patriarch.  Ava Gardner also did not thrill me with her performance as Sarah, who came off as a cold and rather unbecoming figure.  Her first scene is apparently supposed to show the love she and Abraham share with one another, but the whole episode makes Sarah seem wanton and made me feel pretty darn icky long before it was over.  Of course, Sarah's wish to have her servant Hagar bear Abraham the child she could not give him has always hurt my opinion of the couple, a feeling only exacerbated by Abraham's abandonment of Hagar and Ishmael after God delivers on His promise that the elderly, barren Sarah would bear a son to be named Isaac.  The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is of course interesting, and Huston certainly made the point about Sodom being a den of pure evil as the angels of the Lord enter to save Lot and his family (including his wife who would pay for disobeying God's order not to look back as the family is fleeing).The film ends with Abraham's almost-sacrifice of his beloved son Isaac.  Abraham totally wigs out a couple of times, especially as he and Isaac make their way through the ruins of Sodom, but the reaction is understandable.  This was the hardest test God could have given to Abraham, and the man's faith cannot be questioned by God or man as the film's credits begin to roll.This film really isn't that well-known these days, and I think it does have some weaknesses.  Ironically, the humor that works its way into the story of Noah makes an otherwise long, dry film much more bearable, however.  No other film I know of sets out to do what this film does, however, and that makes it more than worth one's time.  I don't think it will necessarily help to convert unbelievers, but those of Christian or Jewish faith may well benefit from this recreation of the earliest stories recorded in the Bible and Torah.",4,"A star-studded, somewhat kooky dramatization of Genesis 1-22",1091318400,"08 1, 2004",2004,4178,"['Bible', 'Beginning', 'most', 'interesting', 'motion', 'picture', 'course', 'almost', 'three', 'hours', 'people', 'events', 'first', 'twenty-two', 'chapters', 'Book', 'Genesis', 'are', 'brought', 'life', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'characters', 'direction', 'John', 'Huston', 'Dino', 'Delaurentiis', 'producer', 'strange', 'film', 'times', 'very', 'moving', 'communicative', 'Biblical', 'message', 'other', 'times', 'strangely', 'surrealistic', 'downright', 'comical', 'few', 'exceptions', 'pretty', 'faithful', 'reenactment', 'Biblical', 'text', 'however', 'certainly', 'count', 'something', 'film', 'can', 'basically', 'be', 'broken', 'down', 'several', 'sections', 'Creation', 'original', 'sin', 'first', 'murder', 'Noah', 'flood', 'tower', 'Babel', 'life', 'Abraham.The', 'creation', 'world', 'given', 'slow', 'sonorous', 'treatment', 'drag', 'just', 'little', 'bit', 'Then', 'have', 'creation', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'mention', 'whole', 'rib', 'business', 'found', 'somewhat', 'strange', 'see', 'Eve', 'drawn', 'Tree', 'Knowledge', 'Good', 'Evil', 'almost', 'immediately', 'serpent', 'job', 'was', 'made', 'quite', 'easy', 'must', 'say', 'rather', 'liked', 'manner', 'serpent', 'was', 'represented', 'here', 'ejection', 'Adam', 'Eve', 'Garden', 'pretty', 'powerful', 'stuff', 'later', 'murder', 'Abel', 'jealous', 'brother', 'Cain', 'played', 'young', 'Richard', 'Harris', '.Then', 'story', 'Noah', 'Great', 'Flood', 'be', 'favorite', 'part', 'movie', 'John', 'Huston', 'Noah', 'remarkable', 'performance', 'seriousness', 'downright', 'goofiness', 'Ark', 'impressive', 'truly', 'immense', 'size', 'thing', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'get', 'big', 'kick', 'seeing', 'animals', 'trot', 'two', 'two', 'including', 'lions', 'tigers', 'polar', 'bears', 'elephants', 'penguins', 'etc.', 'also', 'thought', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'was', 'presented', 'impressive', 'fashion', 'sight', 'Nimrod', 'climbing', 'top', 'order', 'shoot', 'arrow', 'up', 'heavens', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'more', 'earned', 'God', 'anger', 'resulted', 'dispersal', 'different', 'languages', 'people.I', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'action', 'surrounding', 'Abraham', 'George', 'C.', 'Scott', 'one', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'live', ""'m"", 'just', 'not', 'sure', 'was', 'good', 'choice', 'play', 'Hebrew', 'patriarch', 'Ava', 'Gardner', 'also', 'did', 'not', 'thrill', 'performance', 'Sarah', 'who', 'came', 'off', 'cold', 'rather', 'unbecoming', 'figure', 'first', 'scene', 'apparently', 'supposed', 'show', 'love', 'Abraham', 'share', 'one', 'whole', 'episode', 'Sarah', 'seem', 'wanton', 'made', 'feel', 'pretty', 'darn', 'icky', 'long', 'was', 'over', 'course', 'Sarah', 'wish', 'have', 'servant', 'Hagar', 'bear', 'Abraham', 'child', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'always', 'hurt', 'opinion', 'couple', 'feeling', 'only', 'exacerbated', 'Abraham', 'abandonment', 'Hagar', 'Ishmael', 'God', 'delivers', 'promise', 'elderly', 'barren', 'Sarah', 'would', 'bear', 'son', 'be', 'named', 'Isaac', 'destruction', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'course', 'interesting', 'Huston', 'certainly', 'made', 'point', 'Sodom', 'being', 'den', 'pure', 'evil', 'angels', 'Lord', 'enter', 'save', 'Lot', 'family', 'including', 'wife', 'who', 'would', 'pay', 'disobeying', 'God', 'order', 'not', 'look', 'back', 'family', 'fleeing', '.The', 'film', 'ends', 'Abraham', 'almost-sacrifice', 'beloved', 'son', 'Isaac', 'Abraham', 'totally', 'out', 'couple', 'times', 'especially', 'Isaac', 'make', 'way', 'ruins', 'Sodom', 'reaction', 'understandable', 'was', 'hardest', 'test', 'God', 'could', 'have', 'given', 'Abraham', 'man', 'faith', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'questioned', 'God', 'man', 'film', 'credits', 'begin', 'roll.This', 'film', 'really', ""n't"", 'well-known', 'days', 'think', 'have', 'weaknesses', 'Ironically', 'humor', 'way', 'story', 'Noah', 'otherwise', 'long', 'dry', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'bearable', 'however', 'No', 'other', 'film', 'know', 'sets', 'out', 'do', 'what', 'film', 'however', 'more', 'one', 'time', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'necessarily', 'help', 'convert', 'unbelievers', 'Christian', 'Jewish', 'faith', 'may', 'well', 'benefit', 'recreation', 'earliest', 'stories', 'recorded', 'Bible', 'Torah']",The Bible...In the Beginning VHS

418320,A19PHVY41E0XSU,6304386168,Dr. O'Boogie,"[2, 4]","I saw this in the theater when I was 10 years old, and I was both captivated and bored at the same time. John Huston once said he always wanted to do a biblical epic, but unfortunately he was a little late. By 1966 these type of epics had become passe as indicated a year earlier by the box office and critical failure of George Stevens' mammoth all-star production of the story of Christ ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (PLEASE! John Wayne as a Roman centurian?). Biblical epics hit their stride in the 50s with the first Cinemascope presentation of ""The Robe"" through ""The Ten Commandments"" and then hit their peak with ""Ben Hur"" in 1959. By the early 60s, it had become more fashionable to do epics that were straight out of the history books rather than the Bible with the likes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"".So what does old John do? He goes way back to well...The Beginning. Starts off with the story of Adam and Steve, oops...Adam and Eve (my apologies to gay community) starring a very young pre-""Then Came Bronson"" Michael Parks in the buff. This segment is rather frustrating because to get the censors off his back for the nakedness presented here, John opt for soft-focus lenses and very little exposure resulting in a rather dark fuzzy picture. We, of course, move on to Richard Harris playing Caine beating his brother Abel to a pulp, the world's first murder, and then cast out of the Garden of Eden. Then we come to the most entertaining part of the film, Noah and the Ark. With Huston himself playing Noah, this segment has the only comedy you'll find here while still maintaining the dignity of the story. Whenever I watch this part, I just can't help but be reminded of Bill Cosby's classic Noah routine:God: NOAH!Noah: What! What do you want?God: YOU GOT TWO MALE HIPPOS THERE AND YOU NEED TO TAKE ONE OUT AND BRING IN A FEMALE!Noah: I'm not doing nothin' you change one of them!God: COME ON, YOU KNOW I DON'T WORK LIKE THAT!After the intermission, we go into the Tower of Babel with an unrecognizable Stephen Boyd playing Nimrod. Then the film really starts to bog down with the story of Abraham that is just too slow and long despite George C. Scott's passionate performance. The only highlight is when we get to Sodom and Gomorrah. Here, Huston does a really neat little special effect with Peter O'Toole playing the three angels. You see the angels all sitting in the same frame with their hooded robes shadowing their faces, when each one speaks, you see O'Toole's face appear! Pretty nifty! After that, the film just continues to drag on to the final attempted sacrifice of Abraham's son Isaac at the conclusion.Is the film a total failure? I wouldn't say so. Technically, it's beautifully done with great cinematography and a majestic music score by Toshir Mayuzumi that would've even made Mikl&oacute;s R&oacute;zsa (Ben Hur) envious. Huston initially wanted this to be part one of a series on the Old Testament, but the box office performance pretty much nixed that. So, basically I would recommend this film to Bible completist and maybe parents who would want to present the Old Testament to their kids in a more entertaining fashion. The Bible is a very metaphorically cryptic book to be able to translate well to the big screen. Only ""The Ten Commandments"" was able pull it off successfully in terms of going more verbatim while the ""The Robe"" and ""Ben Hur"" used the Bible as more of a backdrop of a human story.

In the Beginning was one of two films photographed in D-150 (the other was Patton), designed to be projected on a deeply curved screen 92 feet wide from a 70mm print. In any home theater I've ever seen it would be impossible to get the hypnotic immersion and suspension of disbelief available in either a D-150 equipped theater or in one of the other 70 mm theaters ... and suspension of disbelief is especially helpful with a film like The Bible.* The older DVD of The Bible was very substandard, but in 70mm the film had a marvelously clear ""walk into it"" quality.  If the Blu-ray is good, sitting much closer to your screen than usual may help get some of the involvement back.  This would be true with most Blu-rays made from 70 mm prints (or 65 mm original color negatives).* At the San Francisco Film Festival John Huston said he regarded the film as ""a poem of a myth, like the Illiad.""  Most reviewers didn't get that.  Religious liberals tended to object to, and were mystified by, the literalist treatment of the subject matter, and some fundamentalists didn't like the (few) liberties taken.* Certain sequences (e.g., The Creation) do constitute a visual poem, and a good one at that.  Huston's portrayal of Noah was utterly charming, as was that whole sequence.* The Noah's Ark sequence was shown during Huston's appearance at the film festival.  Immediately afterward, someone in the audience asked him ""How could the critics so dislike this film?""  Huston answered, ""They really missed the boat on this one.""  That got a laugh.For a description of D-150, see the widescreen museum (online), page 14 of Todd-AO",4,Pretty Good if the Blu-ray transfer is good --Potentially visually arresting,1305158400,"05 12, 2011",2011,1715,"['hope', 'Blu-ray', 'good', 'DVD', 'inferior', 'transfer', 'John', 'Huston', 'Bible', 'Beginning', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'films', 'photographed', 'D-150', 'other', 'was', 'Patton', 'designed', 'be', 'projected', 'deeply', 'curved', 'screen', '92', 'feet', 'wide', '70mm', 'print', 'home', 'theater', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'impossible', 'get', 'hypnotic', 'immersion', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'available', 'D-150', 'equipped', 'theater', 'one', 'other', '70', 'mm', 'theaters', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'especially', 'helpful', 'film', 'Bible', '*', 'older', 'DVD', 'Bible', 'was', 'very', 'substandard', '70mm', 'film', 'had', 'marvelously', 'clear', 'walk', 'quality', 'Blu-ray', 'good', 'sitting', 'much', 'closer', 'screen', 'usual', 'may', 'help', 'get', 'involvement', 'back', 'would', 'be', 'true', 'most', 'Blu-rays', 'made', '70', 'mm', 'prints', '65', 'mm', 'original', 'color', 'negatives', '*', 'San', 'Francisco', 'Film', 'Festival', 'John', 'Huston', 'said', 'regarded', 'film', 'poem', 'myth', 'Illiad', 'Most', 'reviewers', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'Religious', 'liberals', 'tended', 'object', 'were', 'mystified', 'literalist', 'treatment', 'subject', 'matter', 'fundamentalists', 'did', ""n't"", 'few', 'taken', '*', 'Certain', 'sequences', 'e.g.', 'Creation', 'do', 'constitute', 'visual', 'poem', 'good', 'one', 'Huston', 'portrayal', 'Noah', 'was', 'utterly', 'charming', 'was', 'whole', 'sequence', '*', 'Noah', 'Ark', 'sequence', 'was', 'shown', 'Huston', 'appearance', 'film', 'festival', 'Immediately', 'afterward', 'someone', 'audience', 'asked', 'How', 'could', 'critics', 'so', 'film', 'Huston', 'answered', 'really', 'missed', 'boat', 'one', 'got', 'laugh.For', 'description', 'D-150', 'see', 'widescreen', 'museum', 'online', 'page', '14', 'Todd-AO']",The Bible...In the Beginning VHS

Huston is a phenomenal Noah, and you can actually believe that the period before, during, and after the Flood occurred in this fashion.  He is remarkable as the Patriarch who's in love with the animals which the Lord God brings his way and preserves - two-by-two - in order to replenish the Earth after the Flood.Aside from Noah, probably the most engrossing of them all is Abraham's depiction by George C. Scott, and at times, Scott played Abraham with a heavy hand, and the scene before he is asked to sacrifice Isaac was a bit much, with Scott carrying on very melodramatically.  But overall, it was still worth the price for the film.Do yourself a favor and get this film.

Abraham was willing to offer up his son because, for one thing, it was an act of God that he and his wife had him. His wife was well beyond child-bearing age, so he had faith that God could bring him back to life and that's why God blessed him.

Though undeniably reverent and generally (though not totally) faithful to the original Scriptures, Huston's film is ultimately epic in scope but too often cold and unmoving.  There are certainly some fine scenes, particularly in the Creation , the story of the Garden of Eden (Adam and Eve's storm-shrouded exile from Paradise is perhaps the most powerful moment in the whole film), Cain and Abel, and an especially moving interlude between Abraham and only son Isaac in the ruins of sinful Sodom.  But Huston fails to make the movie emotionally appealing on a consistent basis, so that what should have been an enthralling picture is merely adequate--which, after all, is not so bad.  The cast is very powerful, featuring Richard Harris, Ava Gardner, George C. Scott, Peter O'Toole, and Huston himself as an endearing Noah.  If only Huston had let his performers live a little on camera, this might have rivaled The Ten Commandments.  As it is, the whole is respectable but flawed, too passionless and slow-paced to match The Ten Commandment's grandeur.

Of course, John Huston was an atheist, and this needs to be taken into consideration.  He did soften parts of this to portray more typically human reactions, especially with the scenes between Abraham and his son Isaac, than the Bible portrays.The portrayal of God seems accurate enough.  But to portray the devoutness of the human characters would take a more devout director.  The result is a lack of conviction in some scenes.This lack of conviction therefore will disturb many drawn to the movie who will see that this isn't truly filmed as a portrayal of actual history.  It comes across more as a dramatization of myth, and the viewer's reaction therefore will depend on that viewer's perspective.As spectacle, it avoids the DeMille type excess.

418372,A5ZUZ49YRDPCV,6304386168,Rachel Garret,"[40, 45]","1966: Huston's film covers the first twenty chapters of Genesis- from the Creation, the Flood to Isaac's near sacrifice. With lush cinematography, fine acting and superb music. Richard Harris, Ava Gardner, George C. Scott and Peter O'Toole are among the cast. In the 60's, and in fact years before in the 50's, the bible dramas were quite popular and appealed to many audiences who had undergone war and conflict from home- it was the turbulent 60's after  all. The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur were transcendent films only a couple of years before.Making a film about the first book in the Bible, the most mysterious and most alluring, Genesis, must not have been an easy task for director John Huston, nor was it easy enough for actors portraying biblical characters. But this film is exquisite, well-done with fine performances by the actors, most notably Richard Harris as Noah and George C. Scott as Abraham. The actor and actress playing Adam and Eve are just as most of us imagine them to be - gorgeous in the nude, walking around a beautiful, semi-tropical garden and being seduced by the apple in a tree which a treacherous snake deceived them into eating.The film goes on to describe the biblical scenario established before the Flood, of humankind's lechery and vice in Sodom and Gomorrah, and God's wrath resulting in destruction. Very powerful imagery and very fine interpretation. It is not just a Christian or Catholic film, it is a film worth watching just for the moving drama. After all, life is but a drama, a film of which we all take part of. The music to this film is also very inspiring, although subtle and haunting. ""The Bible..

418373,A1Z0LLO7WEKMUW,6304386168,"Randle Rector ""Randy""","[2, 2]","This film was released in September of 1966, which placed it at the close of a long tradition of Hollywood Biblical epics. I was around ten years old and had a vinyl LP of its great musical score which I played over and over before I finally saw the movie on the big screen of a theater. Our family was not particularly religious, but this film was one of those that had a profound influence on me and made me interested in knowing more about the Bible.Looking at it today, I see more depth. The opening footage from all over the world of the days of the Creation is still breathtaking. As a child I felt uncomfortable with the partially nude scenes of Adam and Eve, and even now I believe nudity needs to be implied. Otherwise my mind stops focusing on the story and thinks ""I just saw a naked actor!"". Also, a theory of some Bible commentators is that animals are clothed with feathers or fur, and Adam and Eve were clothed with a glow of light emanating from within them; when they sinned that glow disappeared and they were then totally naked before they hit on the idea of fig leaves. (This interpretation would not likely have been known to John Huston). Beyond that, the film rolls on quite nicely through the first twenty-two chapters of Genesis. The cinematography is rich and beautiful. I do think a few too many scenes were interpreted as desert settings, since many of the Bible lands were lush and only outskirted by desert as a result of the climatology of the region being somewhat different more than 4,000 years ago (though of course that's controversial). Either way the storyline still follows the episodes of salvation history. One reviewer said it looks like they just kept shooting until they ran out of film and decided to call it quits. To me it was essential they kept going until they climaxed the film with the sacrifice of Isaac, which pointed forward to the day when God would inaugurate a new creation. Thus there is a great arc of theme in the epic from ""In the Beginning"" to ""The New Beginning"".Overall the movie looks like a live-action version of Sunday School art. By that I mean most of the scenes are like pictures I've seen in religious artworks. For example, Adam and Eve are portrayed by clean-shaven white people. Cain bashes Abel over the head instead of slitting his throat (like the sacrifices he'd watched - see I John 3:12 in the original Jerusalem Bible [1966], not the New Jerusalem Bible [1985]). This Tower of Babel somewhat rightly resembles a Sumerian ziggurat, yet more resembles Renaissance paintings of it. Modern researchers have discovered that Noah could have been a king, and the ark was actually a huge flat barge shaped like a giant shoebox to ride the tidal waves of the Flood. The movie pictures things like I've seen them all my life: a peasant Noah, and a rounded boat with a house on top (and that shape would capsize in no time). The only thing they didn't have was a giraffe sticking out of the window.Nevertheless, you may enjoy these traditional depictions. I'm just preferring literal Biblical research combined with the look of what has been discovered in archaeology, yet for me the overall effect of this film is still profound and quite moving. It's been said that George C. Scott's portrayal of Abraham was the low point of the movie, but I thought his crusty performance was inspiring! (I was also thankful they didn't picture Abraham like Santa Claus). For the most part, watching this film was an enjoyable and uplifting experience. Any Biblical movie should give us a taste of what things were like; then we should always go back and read the Book. There we will find the authentic atmosphere of the actual words. Still, one line the scriptwriters put in the mouth of Abraham is not found in the Bible, yet it does reflect what the Bible says of him. It has helped me with my faith.

Standout scenes are the death of Abel by Cain, Adam and Eve being driven from the Garden of Eden, Abraham's visit from the Angel of God and the gathering of men at Sodom, blinded by the two Angels. The Sodom scene, with all its wickedness, would be considered ""politically incorrect"" by Hollywood today, but is a directorial masterpiece. The Noah's Ark gathering of the animals is a commendable assemblage of creatures, but John Houston's portrayal of Noah is much too comical for such a strong Biblical patriarch. Adam and Eve seemed too mechanical, in a very pale Eden, in what should have been a beautifully breathtaking opportunity for the cinematographer of Paradise. And according to scripture, Isaac was probably a bit older than the small actor we see in the film. But George C. Scott believably delivers as Abraham; especially when about to give his son as a sacrifice.

Not really the whole Bible, or even the first five Books of Moses, rather, this is a condensation of the first 22 chapters of the Book of Genesis. There's the Creation, the Flood, Tower of Babel, Abraham (George C. Scott) and his family problems.  Huston seemed to not have his heart in the production but certainly brings to life the character of Noah, whom he plays with a comical turn.Some of the scenes are startling in their scope -- like the view from atop the Tower of Babel -- but many are not, even though there is a somewhat faithful adherence to the source material. What remains on screen, and lingers in the mind after final fade out, is the initial dysfunctional family split that has given rise to the historical conflict of the two great family lines that were promised to Abraham's seed.  Is our world a bomb whose fuse was lit because Abraham doubted God?Someone recently said to me in earnest, ""Why can't everyonejust quit fighting and act like Christians.""

418385,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,6304386168,Simon Davis,"[8, 10]","John Huston's 1966 offering &quot;The Bible....In the Beginning&quot; is a film which definately grows on you with each viewing. Often criticised for being slow moving, lacking in any real action or purpose, I feel it is a very beautiful production that honours greatly the first 22 chapters of the book of Genesis from the world's creation through to the story of Abraham and Issac. It is greatly anticipated Easter viewing each year for me and I find there are always new points of interest to appreciate in this ambitious effort.Obviously tackling the &quot;most famous book in the world&quot; would be a daunting task for anyone however within a three hour running time John Huston has managed to create a piece of work on a human level that while very reverant to the material being handled, also never shies away from the harshness and brutality in some of the chapters. Each of these chapters from Genesis has a distinct character of its own and this lavish production does each in turn proud. My personal favourite is the Adam and Eve sequence with a recreation of the famed garden of Eden which is just as I had always envisioned it. Michael Parks and Ulla Bergryd make the perfect Adam and Eve with their youthful goodlooks and innocense. The use of a male figure as the serpent in the mysterious Tree of Knowledge, often criticised, is a vivid and original image to use here and is a great choice. Each of the chapters unfolds with new wonders for the viewer as we pass through the story of Adam and Eve's sons Cain and Able which contains a marvellous performance by Richard Harris as Cain to the story of Noah and the great flood which includes some of the most spectacular special effects of the film in its depiction of the building of the ark and then the forty days and forty nights of rainfall resulting in the extinction of all living things on earth except those saved in the arch. In this sequence John Huston who also narrates as the voice of God makes an appearance as Noah and his refreshing and semi comical depiction of the ark builder is a joy to behold and somehow for me is how I always imagined Noah to actually be, a little eccentric and highly likeable. Later sequences take us through the building of the Tower of Babel with Stephen Boyd as the selfish ruler Nimrod who is reponsible for God mixing up the languages of all mankind so that such a project can never be attempted again, to the saga of Sodom and Gomorrah and God's retribution on those cities who have lost sight of God's teachings. The transformation of Lot's wife into a pillar of Salt is one memorable image in this section of the story. The acting throughout by the leads is memorable and the final lengthy chapter dealing with Abraham and Sarah although drawn out, offers superb performances by legends George C. Scott and Ava Gardner in a beautifully understated performance as Sarah who gives birth to Issac as an old woman.Perhaps the most breathtaking aspect of &quot;The Bible....In the Beginning&quot;, is the sensational use of location photography using the landscapes of Africa and the Middle East to their best advantage. Filmed also in Rome the film boasts lush cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno in all the chapters and of course as mentioned previously the special effects for scenes such as the expelling of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden , the scenes of the great flood and the decadence and eventual destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah are sensational.&quot;The Bible....In the Beginning&quot; should never be passed off as just another religious film to be viewed at Easter etc. It is vivid storytelling at its best. The use of a narrator instead of a great deal of dialogue between the actors is an original way of presenting the stories and indeed would not be to everyones taste however John Huston's clear narration adds a special element to the unfolding action. Each of the stories of Genesis hold their own pieces of interest and despite the films long running time it is an engrossing visualisation of the stories from the Bible that I grew up with. I always get particular worth out of this movie during the Easter period when my thoughts often go back to those far off times at the start of my religion's history. &quot;The Bible..In the Beginning&quot; is worth looking at as a good piece of cinema but also as one of the best visualisations of these famous stories that you are likely to see.

418391,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,6304386168,The Mysterious Traveler,"[6, 7]","THE BIBLE(1966) Directed by John Huston. Script by(among others) Christopher Fry and Orson Welles. Produced by Dino De Laurentis. Some score written by Ennio Morricone.Starring George C Scott(as Abraham), Ava Gardiner(as Sarah), Peter OToole(as the Three Angels), Richard Harris(as Cain), Stephen Boyd(as Nimrod), Michael Parks(as Adams body), Franco Nero(as Abel), David Warner(as the voice of Adam) and John Huston as the Narrator, the serpent, Noah and God.Basically, save for the odd omission, the first 22 chapters of Genisis up to the Sacrifice of Abraham and, as such, really an anthology of various stories from that section of the Good Book. This tends to have the film feel somewhat themeless, disconnected and cursory. It is not helped being directed by Huston who, apparently anticipating the cold style of Kubricks 2001 A SPACE ODYSESY, does not appear to have a feel for the material at all. Worse with Huston's somewhat egocentric decision to play four different parts results in scenes where he is basically having two or three way conversations with him self. And his performance as God is probably the worst one could imagine. No awe. No majesty. What? Was Charleton Heston or Paul Frees busy that year??Why not at all a bad film, it really is not terribly succesful and mostly uninspired. The Noah's ark sequence is heralded as being the best and it is pretty good but no where near Michael Curtiz's take on the story from the famous silent film. The film would have been better served by being released as two seperate films--the first ending with Noah's ark and the second being the story of Abraham. The aforementioned second half actually has the best sequences. The Tower of Babel sequence, the Sacrifice of Abraham and particularly the Sodon and Gomorrah sequences are worth sitting through the rest of the film to see. To Huston's credit, he truly makes it clear just how and in what way the two Evil cities were so foul..truly slime pits. Best performances are Boyd as Nimrod and Peter OToole as the three angels sent to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah. Huston as Noah and Scott as Abraham are middling and Harris as Cain is unsuccessful.The film makes one realize just how much a genius Cecil B. DeMille was.Still worth a look for a variety of reasons.",2,In the Beginning God created the universe and then in 1966 Hollywood made this.......,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2012,2275,"['BIBLE', '1966', 'Directed', 'John', 'Huston', 'Script', 'others', 'Christopher', 'Fry', 'Orson', 'Welles', 'Produced', 'Dino', 'De', 'Laurentis', 'score', 'written', 'Ennio', 'Morricone.Starring', 'George', 'C', 'Scott', 'Abraham', 'Ava', 'Gardiner', 'Sarah', 'Peter', 'OToole', 'Three', 'Angels', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'Cain', 'Stephen', 'Boyd', 'Nimrod', 'Michael', 'Parks', 'Adams', 'body', 'Franco', 'Nero', 'Abel', 'David', 'Warner', 'voice', 'Adam', 'John', 'Huston', 'Narrator', 'serpent', 'Noah', 'God.Basically', 'save', 'odd', 'omission', 'first', '22', 'chapters', 'Genisis', 'up', 'Sacrifice', 'Abraham', 'such', 'really', 'anthology', 'various', 'stories', 'section', 'Good', 'Book', 'have', 'film', 'feel', 'somewhat', 'themeless', 'disconnected', 'cursory', 'not', 'helped', 'being', 'directed', 'Huston', 'who', 'apparently', 'anticipating', 'cold', 'style', 'Kubricks', '2001', 'A', 'SPACE', 'ODYSESY', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'feel', 'material', 'Worse', 'Huston', 'somewhat', 'egocentric', 'decision', 'play', 'four', 'different', 'parts', 'results', 'scenes', 'where', 'basically', 'having', 'two', 'three', 'way', 'conversations', 'performance', 'God', 'probably', 'worst', 'one', 'could', 'imagine', 'awe', 'majesty', 'What', 'Was', 'Charleton', 'Heston', 'Paul', 'Frees', 'busy', 'year', 'Why', 'not', 'bad', 'film', 'really', 'not', 'terribly', 'succesful', 'mostly', 'uninspired', 'Noah', 'ark', 'sequence', 'heralded', 'being', 'best', 'pretty', 'good', 'where', 'Michael', 'Curtiz', 'take', 'story', 'famous', 'silent', 'film', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'served', 'being', 'released', 'two', 'seperate', 'films', 'first', 'ending', 'Noah', 'ark', 'second', 'being', 'story', 'Abraham', 'aforementioned', 'second', 'half', 'actually', 'best', 'sequences', 'Tower', 'Babel', 'sequence', 'Sacrifice', 'Abraham', 'particularly', 'Sodon', 'Gomorrah', 'sequences', 'are', 'worth', 'sitting', 'rest', 'film', 'see', 'Huston', 'credit', 'truly', 'clear', 'just', 'how', 'what', 'way', 'two', 'Evil', 'cities', 'were', 'so', 'foul..truly', 'slime', 'pits', 'Best', 'performances', 'are', 'Boyd', 'Nimrod', 'Peter', 'OToole', 'three', 'angels', 'sent', 'destroy', 'Sodom', 'Gomorrah', 'Huston', 'Noah', 'Scott', 'Abraham', 'are', 'middling', 'Harris', 'Cain', 'unsuccessful.The', 'film', 'one', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'much', 'genius', 'Cecil', 'B.', 'DeMille', 'was.Still', 'look', 'variety', 'reasons']",The Bible...In the Beginning VHS
