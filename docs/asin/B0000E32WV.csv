I won't go as far as another reviewer did, and question their authenticity; I know that there are &#34;different strokes for different folks.&#34;  But neither I nor my husband could make it through even half-an-hour of this.  It was simply atrociously bad.  The slapstick gags weren't just tired, you could see them coming 3 minutes before they arrived, and even when executed, were executed poorly.From the start, you see the so-called punchlines and gags coming; from the time the bumbling idiot lights a Zippo, you already know what's going to happen, and it actually made me sigh in disappointment to see the result.  Then the crime lord decides to send 3 of the most inept boobs you ever met to the US, to pull off a heist?  WHY?  He even tells Depardieu's character that the idiots with him are useless idiots.  So he pays to send them to the US, for a crime?  Uhhhhhhnnn....???Keitel's performance, unusually for him, isn't even phoned in.  His first appearance?  I swear, it was like he was reading the line from a cue-card off to camera-right, a line he hadn't seen before.  Like he was reading it cold, and giving it his best, half-hearted shot, never thinking for a second that it would actually go anywhere but the cutting room floor.  In fact, that's where most of this film should have been--on the cutting room floor.  It was THAT bad.  And this from a guy who normally chews up the scenery...sad, sad, sad.I didn't see anything to laugh about, not even anything to make me smile.  I was so completely turned off by this movie's ineptitude that I can't tell you what the plotline was about, past the &#34;idiots arrive in America while we see Harvey Keitel reading lines from an off-screen cue-card&#34; point.I wanted to like this movie, because I like the movie stars that are in it, but this didn't even rise to the level of a bad made-for-Cloo movie.  It's THAT bad.  If you want a wasted afternoon, and have nothing else to watch...well, find something else.  It's certainly not my cup of tea.  It's not a mystery, it's not an adventure, it lacks action, and it absolutely lacks &#34;funny.&#34;  I'd be interested to meet a real-live person who could tell me face-to-face that they loved this film.

Abe Vigoda, oftentypecast as a soldier in the mob ( Puzzo's Godfather) or as thenumber 1, in this work, is also present.Focusing on the Chicago area underworld of Black and Hispanicgangs, Italian mob, corrupt FBI agents, the movie has no goal inlimiting itself to a rabid, close-minded crime story.Rather, there's a 50/50 fusion of comedy, satire, lighter momentsthroughout the picture, some gags more effective than others, joinedwith the necessary other serious ones in the story, so as to notdisrespect the viewers who are there not for the humor, but for thetense, thrill and action aspects. So, the film packs entertainmentfor both publics, the serious and the silly minded, the masculineand the feminine combined into one.The DVD consciously made a point of being stylish, classy in acertain sense perhaps from its European roots. e.g. perhaps 30 ormore scenes of Paris, and as many in Chicago, of famous landmarks,are shown, suggesting a international cooperation or fraternitybetween America and France, at least in the underworld.Of course, the required controversial elements are introduced, suchas strip clubs, peep shows, pistols and shotguns, switchblades,muggings, baseball bat assaults. The movie also is resolute in itsdecision in only showing 1970's vintage American cars driven by thegang members, as if to perpetuate a certain stereotype that's sunkinto the minds of the cinephiles.The soundtrack is as talented and discerning in its selections as isare the styling visuals, emphasizing the entertainment and ""feelgood"" aspect of the overall work.",2,"Stylish, comedy, satire film about Chicago underworld visited by the French",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,2254,"['CRIME', 'SPREE', '2003', 'acquired', 'taste', 'viewers', 'considering', 'limited', 'commercial', 'potential', 'USA', 'thefact', 'least', '2', 'French', 'music', 'Johnny', 'Halliday', 'are', 'absolute', 'total', 'unknowns', 'anywhere', 'else', 'France.Because', 'musicians', 'are', 'trained', 'music', 'not', 'acting', 'mostviewers', 'may', 'also', 'shy', 'away', 'renting', 'DVD', 'not', 'thesometimes', 'difficult', 'accents', 'actors', 'when', 'read', 'theirlines.The', 'DVD', 'benefits', 'well-accepted', 'legendary', 'actors', 'HarveyKeitel', 'playing', 'caporegime/', 'pesonovante', 'Chicago', 'area', 'andGerard', 'Depardieu', 'millions', 'fans', 'internationally', 'bringing', 'natural', 'presence', 'work', 'Abe', 'Vigoda', 'oftentypecast', 'soldier', 'mob', 'Puzzo', 'Godfather', 'thenumber', '1', 'work', 'also', 'present.Focusing', 'Chicago', 'area', 'underworld', 'Black', 'Hispanicgangs', 'Italian', 'mob', 'corrupt', 'FBI', 'agents', 'movie', 'goal', 'inlimiting', 'rabid', 'close-minded', 'crime', 'story.Rather', '50/50', 'fusion', 'comedy', 'satire', 'lighter', 'picture', 'gags', 'more', 'effective', 'others', 'necessary', 'other', 'serious', 'ones', 'story', 'so', 'notdisrespect', 'viewers', 'who', 'are', 'there', 'not', 'humor', 'thetense', 'thrill', 'action', 'aspects', 'So', 'film', 'packs', 'entertainmentfor', 'publics', 'serious', 'silly', 'minded', 'masculineand', 'feminine', 'combined', 'one.The', 'DVD', 'consciously', 'made', 'point', 'being', 'stylish', 'classy', 'acertain', 'sense', 'perhaps', 'European', 'roots', 'e.g', 'perhaps', '30', 'scenes', 'Paris', 'as', 'many', 'Chicago', 'famous', 'landmarks', 'are', 'shown', 'suggesting', 'international', 'cooperation', 'fraternitybetween', 'America', 'France', 'least', 'underworld.Of', 'course', 'required', 'controversial', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'suchas', 'strip', 'clubs', 'peep', 'shows', 'pistols', 'shotguns', 'switchblades', 'muggings', 'baseball', 'bat', 'assaults', 'movie', 'also', 'resolute', 'itsdecision', 'only', 'showing', '1970', 'vintage', 'American', 'cars', 'driven', 'thegang', 'members', 'perpetuate', 'certain', 'stereotype', 'minds', 'cinephiles.The', 'soundtrack', 'talented', 'discerning', 'selections', 'isare', 'styling', 'visuals', 'emphasizing', 'entertainment', 'feelgood', 'aspect', 'overall', 'work']",Crime Spree

There are some moments in this movie that are laugh-out-loud funny. All of the French actors in this film are legends in France for one reason or another (some of them are famous music artists) and the nearly always excellent Harvey Keitel and Abe Vigoda also star.The French thieves appear to be bumbling idiots at first, but despite appearances they get it together as the movie progresses, so don't expect non-stop slapstick humour. The laughs are sometimes in the more subtle situation-comedy moments. There are some tense and surprisingly violent scenes too. At times the script was clich&eacute;d (&quot;you must either be brave or very stupid to be here&quot;) and I also felt like a better editor could have salvaged some of the jokes (and punchlines)...there were a few times where there were pauses before or after a joke that felt a bit too: oh i see, you want me to laugh now, right?. I also dislike the premise in movies, where everyone is a potential traitor (which is a cheap and easy way for allowing lots of plot twists to complicate things).The DVD: Nothing except for the director &amp; producer commentary, which is, by the way, very interesting. And I don't mean that in a good way. I advise you to NOT listen to the commentary, because you may suddenly notice a lot more flaws in the film that more seasoned directors (who, granted, probably would have bigger budgets) would have not let go unnoticed. The director/writer Brad Mirman is not a dumb guy, but he's clearly inexperienced and perhaps a bit too pleased with his (debut?) film -- ie. 'oh I love this next scene'.Look past my complaints, this film has a fresh and funny approach on a tired (mafia &amp; fish out of water) theme, with funny and inspired performances all round.
