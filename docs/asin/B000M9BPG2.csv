1044306,A3NAK0QG32XFKL,B000M9BPG2,"Tefilo de Jess ""Vivificat's blogmaster""","[21, 22]","Folks, this is yet another jewel by Italian Radio TV (RAI), a 2005 production abouot the life of St. Peter, starring Omar Sharif.The good thing about this movie is that it portrays the origin and growth of the primitive Church in a manner that is credible and entertaining. The miraculous, when it occurs at all, is portrayed very soberly, matter-of-factly and prosaic. You will find no ""faith healing"" scenes or fiery preachers screaming hell and damnation, emotional repression, and the like. No, you will find a ""band of brothers"" led by a fisherman who learned to love first hand in the school of the Nazarene who once was dead and now, is alive.St. Peter is ably portrayed by Omar Sharif, which I find a surprising choice because he's a Muslim. Sharif has had to suffer a bit for his choice of movie making. According to the Wikipedia, Sharif was born Michel Demitri Chalhoub in Alexandria, Egypt to Joseph Chalhoub, a timber merchant, and Claire (Saada), an Egyptian. The British news daily The Guardian reported back in 2005 ""that a message on a web forum used in the past by al-Qaida had a link to a site carrying the threat. 'Omar Sharif has stated that he has embraced the crusader idolatry,' it said. 'He is a crusader who is offending Islam and Muslims and receiving applause from the Italian people. I give you this advice, brothers, you must kill him.' Other messages posted to the site had protested at the appeal. The Guardian's article also highlighted Sharif's current ""unbeliever"" credentials.Nevertheless, art is art and Sharif is an artist. His portrayal of St. Peter was of one of a strong, yet meek man. We don't get the sense of choleric angst we perceive in other portrayals of the Fisherman, such as the one portrayed by James Farentino in the 1977 miniseries, Jesus of Nazareth. Instead, Sharif plays St. Peter as a man in search of love, true Christ-like love who then finds himself in the awesome and quite undeserved position of having to confer, define, and defend that love for thousands of others.In a book I read awhile back, Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God by Jack Miles, I found an interesting thought. If a Person was born in this world and has nothing else in his calendar but one single appointment, and has an urgent message to share and only two years to do it, who will he choose to carry his message? Well, the answer is, anybody. Anybody would do, no matter how rustic his or her background or how culture. Anyone would do and that's what he did. He chose nobodies. These nobodies went ahead and changed the world by the power of their example and their speech, no swords, no invasions, no machinations with the high and mighty, no jihads, and no forced conversions. It was just themselves, the power of their idea, and the promise by the One that he ""will be with them until the end of the world"" and that's forever. St. Peter successfully captures the essence of the kerygma and its power to convince, change minds and convert.Directed by Giulio Base, the movie has several scenic and signature moments. One of my favorites is when Peter, guided by Paul, meets the Christians in Antioch. He is taken to a second story hallway that opens like a balcony into an inner courtyard. Down in the courtyard you see the Christians of Antioch acclaiming him. Sharif affects a John Paul the Great gesture and raises his two hands slightly in front of him to greet them back as he smiles to them. The moment looks completely Papal and explains the spiritual attraction Catholics feel for the Bishop of Rome not necessarily because who he is personally, rather, because he is Peter. The scenes of Peter's martyrdom look like the paintings one might find in an old family Bible or in a Missal. They were beautifully done. The transition to a surprising finale was exquisite, going a long way to explain in pictures what we Catholic Christians believe and why regarding the person of St. Peter.I just have one less-than-good thing to say about this movie and that is at times it becomes formulaic. The movie contains various subplots, one of them the love story between the good-hearted yet conflicted pagan man and the devoted, yet strong Christian woman. I saw this same subplot in another movie from these series I reviewed before, The Apocalypse - Starring Richard Harris. I suppose that I should expect these subplots but that doesn't mean I should like them. Nevertheless, these don't subtract anything from the movie's main premise.St. Peter is worth your time and money. It is ideal for family viewing or watch with friends at home or at church. It can also become a good catechetical tool about the power and the meaning of Christian Love, a central theme in Pope Benedict's first encyclical. It can also be a great apologetic proof against those who thing impossible or highly unlikely that St. Peter every made it to Rome, much less becoming what we Catholics said he became: the first in a long line of very human men who are witnesses to the Resurrection of Christ.Thank God for good cinema, thank God for St. Peter.",4,"Thank God for good cinema, thank God for St. Peter",1195862400,"11

It has good music and beautiful photography. It is also fast-moving enough to keep teenagers interested. Less stodgy than ""Quo Vadis"" from the 1950s and less talky than ""Peter and Paul"" with Anthony Hopkins, this is the sort of movie that takes the BORING out of Bible. Omar Sharif is also the best Peter on film, conveying an intensity of contrition and humble love for Christ that carries this movie and distinguishes Sharif from the slightly self-righteous portrayals of actors who play the role in other films. He wisely makes Peter more real and relatable by emphasizing the character's weakness and self-doubts rather than his pride. It helps that the screenplay is nicely balanced to cover several phases of Peter's life. The movie's first half is loosely based on the ""Acts of the Apostles,"" while the second half follows Paul's letters and the historical traditions surrounding the fate of Peter in Rome. Unfortunately, the English voices on this Italian import are too obviously dubbed, sounding artificial at times. I also found myself wishing for more biblical material from Paul's letters and less fictionalized melodrama in the film's second half. But these are minor quibbles in a film that does more justice to Peter in himself than any previous movie. As you continue to watch the film, it's hard to look away from the beautiful scenes, making the acting and screenplay into minor distractions at best. The screenplay offers fresh interpretations on scenes from the Acts of the Apostles, while the acting offers clearly telegraphed emotions which lift the film beyond a mere Sunday school lesson. Stylistically, the director Giulio Base seems to favor the beauty of religious experiences over the talkiness/preachiness that infects much of this genre. This movie is filled with ""good scenes"" which carry the viewer along despite himself. Some of the most beautiful scenes include the opening shots of Christ and Peter, the empty tomb at the resurrection, Peter swimming to Jesus on the shore, the conversion of Paul, the apostles traveling the world to preach, the gospel flashbacks with Christ and Jesus throughout the film, Paul's trial and execution scenes, the gladiatorial scenes, the Lord's supper led by Peter, the ""Quo Vadis"" moment near the film's end, Peter's crucifixion, and the surprising final shot.
