Quipped ""the original underdog story in amateur sports,"" 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' has to rank with 'Hoosiers,' 'Seabiscuit,' and 'Miracle' among the greatest sports' movies.  And, like the others, it has a concrete story that rises above the field of play.  Here we have our underclass protagonist, Francis Ouimet (Shia La Beouf), who lives close to a country club in Brookline, MA in 1913.  While the golf game is infectious to him, he is mostly excluded from its participation by those of greater money and tradition.  Typical to a movie plot, the mother nurtures his dreams for success, but his father is understandably practical and skeptical.  Then there is also that endearing love interest to a wealthy woman, Shari Wallis (Peyton List) with all the ramifications it has to bridge the class gap.  It all starts with Francis' admiration for golf legend, Harry Varndon (Stephen Dillaine), a British caste system.  Once Francis manages to overcome the obstacles of his status as ""caddy,"" he then can face his hero, Vardon, and the British status quo nemesis, Lord Northcliff (Peter Firth) who sponsors his own British player, as well as the American aristocracy in the temperamental John C. McDerott (Micheal Weaver) in the amateur ""U.S. Open"".The movie itself benefits from every detail.  Mainly it is ""the greatest game"" unsurprisingly enough that gets the focus; while most of the rest is necessary exposition for us to absorb the setting and our interest in the protagonist.  The technical aspects are stunning with embellished graphics.  Each swing becomes a dramatic moment without becoming tiresome.  The drama of the crowd and the press (""...one David against two goliaths..."") kepps the ball rolling as well.  The weahter and some tense moments make the movie often suspenseful, and Francis' [...]caddy, Eddie, provides some needed entertainment.  The acting is earnest enough, and the editing certainly is persnickety to detail.  Director Bill Paxton brings perfect strokes to the film.  The best aspect of 'The Greatest Game Ever Played' is the emotional impact.  Here it garners a hole in one.The extras are particularly good for a DVD.  If you don't mind going behind the stage, so to speak, after a magic show, the technical aspects are explained in a fascinating and concise fashion.  There are the usual Hollywood accolades flowing through the commentary:  ""I couldn't have done it without so and so...,"" but it is worthy material overall.  There is also an interesting 1963 interwiew with Francis Ouimet, fifty years after the ""greatest game ever played"".  In additon, a fine and succinct history is given for the tale of Varndon and Ouimet.

But at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.The acting is exemplary throughout. Stephen Dillane is excellent as usual. But the revelation of the movie is Shia LaBoeuf: After a career which to that point had been principally marked by his slap-stick performances in the children's programme ""Even Stevens"", LaBoeuf delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class Franco-Irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the New England WASP establishment. And Josh Flitter as the ten year old caddy steals every scene in which he appears.A old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to Casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.",5,Even for those who (quite rightly) hate golf,1324857600,"12 26, 2011",2011,1179,"['Bill', 'Paxton', 'taken', 'true', 'story', '1913', 'US', 'golf', 'open', 'made', 'film', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'extra-ordinary', 'game', 'golf', 'film', 'also', 'directly', 'class', 'tensions', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century', 'touches', 'profound', 'anti-Catholic', 'prejudices', 'British', 'American', 'establishments', 'heart', 'film', 'perennial', 'favourite', 'triumph', 'odds.The', 'acting', 'exemplary', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'excellent', 'usual', 'revelation', 'movie', 'Shia', 'LaBoeuf', 'career', 'point', 'had', 'been', 'principally', 'marked', 'slap-stick', 'performances', 'children', 'programme', 'Even', 'Stevens', 'LaBoeuf', 'disciplined', 'dignified', 'highly', 'sympathetic', 'performance', 'working', 'class', 'Franco-Irish', 'kid', 'fighting', 'way', 'prejudices', 'New', 'England', 'WASP', 'establishment', 'Josh', 'Flitter', 'ten', 'year', 'old', 'caddy', 'steals', 'scene', 'old', 'fashioned', 'movie', 'best', 'sense', 'word', 'fine', 'acting', 'clear', 'directing', 'great', 'story', 'end', 'final', 'scene', 'affectionate', 'nod', 'Casablanca', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'pleasures', 'fill', 'great', 'movie']",N/A

83022,A2JSGJE2IGJU20,0788858408,a voice of reason,"[6, 6]","While I am not a golfer, I am a sports fan, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Due to my lack of knowledge of the history of the sport, I had never heard of any of these golfers, but that didn't matter because the golf scenes are suspenseful and the movie is about much more than just the sport. Golf serves as a metaphor for class differences as they were manifested at the turn of the early twentieth century.The parallel between British golf pro and champion Harry Vardon and American amateur Francis Ouimet is deftly drawn. Vardon's poor family was forced off of its land for the sake of a golf course when he was a child, and he was told that ""Golf is a game played by gentlemen; not for the likes of you."" The term gentleman in this era, as we come to see (and in case we didn't already know), has nothing to do with manners but with how much money a man has. Vardon becomes the most successful golfer of his time, but he is still treated much like a lackey by the country club set who, although they like the idea of how his success might rub some fame off on them, can't quite bring themselves to fully include him in their circles (although they attempt to force themselves to forget his roots because they are so enamored of his fame).Francis Ouimet, on the other hand, faces his class challenge at home. America is the land of opportunity in which he should be free to chase his dream, even if the dream is that of becoming a pro golfer. His major obstacle, besides money, is his father who thinks it is foolish for Francis to try to rise above his station in life. The way Francis is treated by the country club set seems to confirm his father's notions, but there are people who are willing to help Francis because they see the talent that he possesses and know that he could become successful on the golf circuit. Vardon himself comes to appreciate Ouimet and his talent, and we know it is because he sees the similarities between the two of them.This leads to the classic underdog-overcomes-many-obstacles-to-success story which we all know and love so much. Disney studios has released some of the best films in this genre in recent years with ""Remember the Titans,"" ""The Rookie,"" ""Miracle,"" ""Glory Road,"" and this film. My only concern is that they are running out of sports about which they can make another such movie. I highly recommend ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" as well as the other films just mentioned. If Disney ever makes another one of these great films and gets it down to zero curse words, then they will have absolutely perfected the genre (although, in fairness, there are only a very few curse words in any of these films; however, the presence of any at all causes some dismay for the family audience which these films are intended to reach).",5,"More than just another ""root for the underdog"" story",1160697600,"10 13, 2006",2006,2782,"['am', 'not', 'golfer', 'am', 'sports', 'fan', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'Due', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'history', 'sport', 'had', 'never', 'heard', 'golfers', 'did', ""n't"", 'matter', 'golf', 'scenes', 'are', 'suspenseful', 'movie', 'about', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'sport', 'Golf', 'metaphor', 'class', 'differences', 'were', 'manifested', 'turn', 'early', 'twentieth', 'century.The', 'parallel', 'British', 'golf', 'pro', 'champion', 'Harry', 'Vardon', 'American', 'amateur', 'Francis', 'Ouimet', 'deftly', 'drawn', 'Vardon', 'poor', 'family', 'was', 'forced', 'land', 'sake', 'golf', 'course', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'was', 'told', 'Golf', 'game', 'played', 'gentlemen', 'not', 'likes', 'term', 'gentleman', 'era', 'come', 'see', 'case', 'did', ""n't"", 'already', 'know', 'nothing', 'do', 'manners', 'how', 'much', 'money', 'man', 'Vardon', 'most', 'successful', 'golfer', 'time', 'still', 'treated', 'much', 'lackey', 'country', 'club', 'set', 'who', 'like', 'idea', 'how', 'success', 'might', 'rub', 'fame', 'off', 'ca', ""n't"", 'quite', 'bring', 'fully', 'include', 'circles', 'attempt', 'force', 'forget', 'roots', 'are', 'so', 'enamored', 'fame', '.Francis', 'Ouimet', 'other', 'hand', 'class', 'challenge', 'home', 'America', 'land', 'opportunity', 'should', 'be', 'free', 'chase', 'dream', 'even', 'dream', 'becoming', 'pro', 'golfer', 'major', 'obstacle', 'money', 'father', 'who', 'foolish', 'Francis', 'try', 'rise', 'station', 'life', 'way', 'Francis', 'treated', 'country', 'club', 'set', 'confirm', 'father', 'notions', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'willing', 'help', 'Francis', 'see', 'talent', 'know', 'could', 'become', 'successful', 'golf', 'circuit', 'Vardon', 'appreciate', 'Ouimet', 'talent', 'know', 'similarities', 'two', 'them.This', 'classic', 'underdog-overcomes-many-obstacles-to-success', 'story', 'know', 'love', 'so', 'much', 'Disney', 'studios', 'released', 'best', 'films', 'genre', 'recent', 'years', 'Remember', 'Titans', 'Rookie', 'Miracle', 'Glory', 'Road', 'film', 'only', 'concern', 'are', 'running', 'sports', 'can', 'make', 'such', 'movie', 'highly', 'recommend', 'Greatest', 'Game', 'Ever', 'Played', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'films', 'just', 'mentioned', 'Disney', 'ever', 'one', 'great', 'films', 'down', 'zero', 'curse', 'words', 'then', 'will', 'have', 'absolutely', 'perfected', 'genre', 'fairness', 'are', 'only', 'very', 'few', 'curse', 'words', 'films', 'however', 'presence', 'dismay', 'family', 'audience', 'films', 'are', 'intended', 'reach']",N/A

Secondly, there were no villains in this film.  Although Harry Vardon was Francis Oimet's opponent, he wasn't really an adversary and certainly wasn't a foe.  Vardon was a man of good character who conducted himself honorably and treated Oimet with respect.  Stephan Dillane has a look which would make for an effective villain, but his portrayal of Vardon as a sympathetic character not too much different from Oimet was done with remarkable effectiveness.  Though I was cheering for Oimet, I also found a part of myself cheering for Vardon as well.  The other supporting characters were also very interesting and engaging, and were played very well by a talented cast.  Bill Paxton again does another great job as a director, combining creative cinematography with understated and effective performances from his cast.Overall, a movie that is entertaining and suitable for all ages.

83025,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,0788858408,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[8, 9]","Watching a movie about a kid's struggle to play golf I'd assumed would be about as appealing as sticking hot needles in my eyes. But I'd heard a few good things about THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED and found out that it was directed by Bill Paxton (ALIENS, 1986) so decided to give it a go. I ordered it from my online rental company and, to my additional horror once it arrived, discovered that it was a Disney film. Oh Lord, nooo! Not having anything else to watch, I swallowed my Mouseketeer bile and slid it into my DVD player.Well, it ain't too bad. Shia Le Beouf stars as 20-year-old Francis Ouimet, the historically amazing young man who had a knack for the game of golf and beat out two ""veteran"" British players (Harry Vardon and Ted Ray)  for the U.S. Open, and did so using a preteen caddy with a loud personality but a love of the game.There have been a lot of films made featuring golf at their cores and I've seen many of them. TIN CUP was probably my favorite. HAPPY GILMORE was funny but in a gruff, teenage sort of way. CADDYSHACK: `nough said. THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE was modestly entertaining. And now we have THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED. Being ""Disneyfied"" the film takes this historical golfing event and puts a gushing feel-good face on it. This isn't necessarily a bad thing; just something you might want to brace yourself for. Francis is at odds with his father, who believes that golf is a waste of time and is outside their class. Francis and his family aren't wealthy and struggle to get by. So the tensions get moved up a few notches as Francis and his father find themselves in the middle of a generation gap. There's a love interest in a woman who's waaaay beyond Francis' means. And there's the growing attraction of the down-and-out toward Francis as they read about his success in the papers during the pre-depression times.The acting was okay. Nothing outstanding with the exception of Francis' little caddy, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND) who steals almost every scene he's in.What made this film a success was how it was filmed. Cameras perched on top of golf balls as they're hit. Special effects that make the crowds vanish and leave the golfer all alone on the fairway with nothing between him and the green.

83030,A2FS38D943KX12,0788858408,chefdevergue,"[86, 87]","One doesn't have to have read Mark Frost's book (he adapted his book for the screenplay) to enjoy this movie.  Obviously, the book contains much more detail regarding the personal histories of Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, JJ McDermott & others leading up to (and following) the 1913 US Open, and there was no way that Frost could have included all of the minute detail without at least doubling the length of the movie.  One also misses the discussion of the technology available to the turn-of-the-century golfer, as well as some of the geo-political forces that led to Vardon & Ted Ray making their tour of the United States.However, what one does get is a beautifully filmed story that has the predictable feel-good nature one would expect from a Disney film, without being sappy.  The principals bear a striking resemblance to the historical figures (right down to Eddie the caddie), and the historical match is accurately rendered.  While one doesn't get the book's stroke by stroke narrative, one does get to enjoy the energy of the galleries as well as the immense pressures bearing down on the tournament leaders.I only have a couple of significant complaints about the movie.  One is with the wholy fictional relationship (concocted for the purposes of this film) between Francis Ouimet and the upper class young lady.  It smacks uncomfortably of Jack-Rose relationship in Titanic, and when the movie focuses on this relationship, it skates dangerously close to outright corniness.  Fortunately, once the tournament begins, this subplot is thankfully relegated to the background.  By & large it interferes only minimally with the story.My other beef is with the fact that Harry Vardon comes off as a far too one-dimensional character, as he as portrayed as an ambitious, single-minded, golfing machine, very nearly bereft of passion or emotion.  Frost's book provides far more depth to Vardon than one will find here.  One would not know from the movie that his American tour came not long after his recovery from a bout with tuberculosis (first striking in 1903, after his 4th British Open) which not only derailed his career (and almost ended it) for several years, but came close to killing him.  If the audience could more fully appreciate all of the tremendous obstacles Vardon had overcome, they might be more sympathetic towards him.  While not cast as a villain, Vardon's role in this film definitely is that of Ouimet's nemesis more than anything else, which strikes me as unfair.The one other thing which strikes as unfair is the fact that the audience really has no idea just how tremendously talented these men were.  Frost's book devotes considerable space to the equipment of the time, which was downright primative compared to the clubs and balls today's players use.  I can only imagine the kinds of scores Vardon & Ouimet might post with today's equipment.  However, audiences who don't understand the nature of golf technology in 1913 may only see shots that can be seen a hundred times or more on any PGA tour event on any given weekend, and they may not appreciate the true greatness of these earlier players.  Having made this complaint, I have to admit that I don't know how the film could improve in this area.  I would suggest that you read the book.However, this is a movie that one can enjoy without having any knowledge of golf in general or the 1913 US Open in particular.  Unlike so many films that claim to be ""based on"" or ""inspired by"" true events (but in fact have almost no resemblance to historical events), what you see in this film by & large is what actually happened.

That's at least three in the past few years that I've really enjoyed, that were well-done, beautifully-filmed and inspirational. The other two were ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" and ""The Legend Of Bagger Vance.""This is a true underdog story, if there ever was one. To have an amateur defeat all the professionals and win the United States Open Golf Tournament - which really did happen - is an unheard-of feat. Francis Ouimet's victory over golf legends Harry Vardon and Ted Ray is fact. It is an amazing story and the filmmakers did a super job in presenting it here. It isn't something just for golf fans; this is a fun movie. Kudso to actor-turned-director Bill Paxton for an outstanding job.Shia LaBeouf is winsome as Ouimet as is Steven Dillane as Vardon. For those who don't know, Vardon was like the Tiger Woods of his day, maybe even more unbeatable. In the film, Vardon is pictured as a warm, nice guy; a genuine human being. the other major competitor, Ray (Stephen Marcus) is shown as somewhat of a brutish nasty guy.The fourth main character of this golf story might be the coolest person in the film: a fifth-grade boy who winds up being Ouimet's caddie in the Open. He (Josh Flitter) brings a lot of humor and charm to the movie.As with another sports film of 2005 - ""Cinderella Man"" - here is another excellent movie that got unjustly ignored when it came to awards.

83032,AUHG8KSHI529U,0788858408,Craig Matteson,"[5, 5]","Sports movies are harder to do than one might first think.  If it is a historical movie, the acts are known, and the necessary fictionalizations for dramatic effect are always criticized.  However, if it is fiction, all the possible tweaks and turns have been done in the previous thousands of such movies made.  One cannot make the movie a downer and expect it to be a blockbuster.  Even if the inevitable ""Big Game"" is lost, the hero has to win in some other way.Anyway, this movie tells the story of the great Francis Ouimet his win of the U.S. Open Championship in 1913 when he was an unknown twenty year old against the even greater Harry Vardon and the then reigning (British) Open Championship winner, Ted Ray.  I really like the way the movie makes a point of Vardon's modest, well poor, no, poverty stricken, origins as it tells us of Ouimet's working class origins as well.  Ouimet, as modest as his family origins were, still had much more than the Vardon household.  Ouimet may have won the U.S. Open at twenty, Vardon didn't even take up the game until he was twenty.The movie tells the story in broad strokes.  It manufactures the story of Ouimet's family and father, though.  Ouimet actually learned the game from his older brother and they had built a three hole course in their backyard, rough as it was, with tomato cans sunk in the ground for holes.  Also, Ouiment did not panic or even breathe hard over the last hole.  Vardon's gamble at 17 had put him several strokes back and Ouimet won in a seeming calm.Still, the story of Ouimet and his ten year old caddy, Eddie Lowery, is charming and the famous picture of them walking the course during the tournament has endured.  I am also delighted that they had the course in the relatively rougher conditions that existed in those days rather than the manicured works of art we have today.  And I loved the accurate sound of the balls rolling on the grass.  And the stymie was a nice touch as well (they don't exist anymore).The actors do a fine job and Bill Paxton did a nice job in putting the story on film.  He keeps things moving and conveys the sense of the golf tournament quite well.  The look of the film is fine (although I doubted they played in coats so much) and it rained more than in the film, but one cannot have rain and gray skies in a movie for audiences.Good film about a golfer anyone who loves the game, or even just likes it more than bit, should know more about.  Ouimet was justly the founder of popular golf in America and for the rest of his life was a wonderful ambassador of the game.  It is good that this film gets his name and the tournament that placed his name in the history books in the popular imagination.  Ouimet also subsequently won two American Amateur Championship titles and other tournaments as well.  Yes, he was surpassed by Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and others, but he was still the guy who put golf on the map of popular sport.Fine family film, too.",4,Francis Ouimet was the founder of golf as a popular American sport.

Also, golf was a game dominated by the British.""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" is a film adapted from a screen play and book titled ""The Greatest Game Ever Played: Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, and the Birth of Modern Golf"" by author Mark Frost (writer for both recent ""Fantastic Four"" films and creator of the cult TV show ""Twin Peaks"") and a film that would be the first directorial debut for a Disney film by actor Bill Paxton (""Twister"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Titanic"", ""U-571"", etc.).The film would feature cinematography by Director of Photography Shane Hurlbut (""Terminator Salvation"", ""Swing Vote"" and ""We Are Marshall"") and composer Brian Tyler (""Eagle Eye"", ""Bangkok Dangerous"" and ""Rambo"") and focus on two golfers who would become the greatest golfers in the history of the sport, American Francis Ouimet (played Shia LaBeouf - ""Transformers"", ""Eagle Eye"", ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"") and Harry Vardon (played by Stephen Dillane - ""King Arthur"", ""Nine Lives"" and Haven"").The film starts off with a young Harry Vardon who lives in an impoverished home and sees a group of men who is building a golf course in his area.  But of course, the builders pay him no mind because golf is a sport for the distinguished.The film then cuts to a young caddie named Francis Ouimet who lives across the street from the golf course.  His father is a hardworking man but believes a man must work hard to pay the bills and his mother is supportive of his interest in golf.  One day, the young Francis dreamed of meeting the popular UK golfer Harry Vardon.  Harry is the first pro golfer to endorse a golf ball titled the ""Vardon Flyer"" made by Spalding and during his travels of promoting merchandise.During a day of promotion, he gives young Francis a tip on how to hold a golf club (which would be known as the ""Vardon Grip"") and it was Francis first major lesson and a moment that made Francis want to play golf.The film then fast forwards to when he's 20 years old.  He is an amateur competing at local tournaments.During that time, golf was a game that was played by people who had money.  They had sponsors and people from distinguished families.  Francis was nether of those.  His father in fact is not supportive of the golf because his son would be treated lower because he was not rich and as an amateur, he can't make any money.But there are rich people who know of Francis's talent and so they give him the opportunity by sponsoring him.  Despite the rich not favoring him because he's a caddie that doesn't belong to any distinguished golfing country clubs.So, Francis eventually gets ready for the tournaments but he loses his main caddie who is offered money to play (Francis has no money).  So, he enlists the help of his friend to be his caddie and his ten-year-old brother Eddie who tags a long.It is also time for the 1913 U.S. Open and although golf is known as a game dominated by the British, there are Americans who want to defend the US title and vow to not have the British win at their home tournament (note: Since the first tournament in 1895 through 1910, the Europeans have won the U.S. Open).  But the British champions Harry Vardon and Ted Ray know that they are the best in the world and look forward to beating the Americans.Francis will be playing the U.S. Open but is not considered a threat because of his status.  In fact, his caddie gets caught for truancy and thus Francis is left with this ten-year-old boy Eddie Lowery who becomes his caddie for the U.S. Open.And the game begins...""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" is an inspiring film that shows us how golf was back then, how heated the rivalry was between the US and the UK but how a 20-year-old named Francis Ouimet, who is from a working class family would inspire Americans of different socio-economic class to enjoy golf and make it become part of America's past-time.VIDEO & AUDIO:""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  There is quite a bit of detail that can be seen in the film.  The grass, the dimples on the golf ball, the grain on the wooden shafts of the golf clubs and the clothing of the time.  One thing that Bill Paxton wanted for the film was the colors to pop (he actually talks about what he wanted to achieve in picture quality in his commentary) and discussed using the Kodachrome process.  The greens, the blues, etc.  But he also discusses, having to use a process to eliminate grain because he did not want grain to be a major factor throughout the film.  The blacks are very nice and deep.  So, the picture quality is actually quite solid.  A very good looking film on Blu-ray!As for the audio, the film is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (and also in French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily a dialogue-based film which utilizes music by Brian Tyler to set the mood. Both audio and music are quite clear as it comes from the front channels.But there is very good use of the fronts and surrounds and also low frequency during the U.S. Open.  The crowds play a significant factor in the film but also Bill Paxton wanted to show a different side of golf playing, so there is CG used when the golf ball is hit and how it lands on the green or the grass.  There is a lot of emphasis on when the golf ball is hit during the initial drive.  You hear the sounds of the club swinging and then the pop as the ball is hit.  So, for the game of golf, the crew were very good in wanting to make the sounds of the game immersive for the viewer of the film and not boring at all.  Especially with husky golfer Ted Ray is supposed to hit the ball, you know that your speakers will get a good workout.As for subtitles, English SDH, French and Spanish is offered.SPECIAL FEATURES:""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" comes with a good number of special features.  All features are presented in 480i Standard Definition, English 2.0 Dolby Digital and with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.  Included are:* Audio Commentary with Director Bill Paxton - Bill Paxton has a very enthusiastic audio commentary, discussing everything from the Kodachrome to the people he hired on staff and is very complimentary.  Paxton focuses on the making of the film.* Audio Commentary with Author, Screenwriter and Producer Mark Frost - While Bill Paxton focuses on the filmmaking end of ""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"", Mark Frost focuses on the history of golf and what transpired at that time.  The differences from his book and the film and information on the actual golfers. Very informative commentary.* A View from the Gallery: On the Set of The Greatest Game Ever Played - (15:22) We learn of how actor Bill Paxton became director and how he himself lived near a golf course and picked up balls for Ben Hogan and how excited of having to become a director of his first film but also his appreciation for golf and a big fan of the original book.  We learn about the people involved in the film and interviews with cast and crew.  From the Director of Photography, composer, people involved with production and costume design, special effects and more.* Two Legends and the Greatest Game - (6:59) A featurette about the two men focused on the film, Harry Vardon who is a legendary British golfer and the man that everyone has based their current golf grip on and the first man to professionally endorse a golf product.  And Francis Ouimet and how he became a legend for winning the U.S. Open but showing America that you didn't have to be rich to win the game and therefore inspiring many Americans to take up the sport.  Also, his friendship with his ten-year-old caddie from when they first took the golf course through their older age.* From Caddie to Champion: Francis Ouimet - (25:15) An actual black and white featurette from 1965 hosted by Fred Cusick as he interviews Francis Ouimet.JUDGMENT CALL:Although I play golf, I have to admit that I knew nothing about Francis Ouimet.  Aside from him getting a US Postage Stamp in dedication to him, I never realize his influence on the game of golf until now.  Especially, the British golfer Harry Vardon and how different the game of golf was back at that time.""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" is definitely an inspiring film and it was great to see the correlation between these two golfers.Harry Vardon grew from an impoverished upbringing.  How a group of men who built a golf course near his home treated him like he was a nobody because he wasn't rich and used that to drive him to win and become one of the greatest golf players of all time.  He has records that still stand and he is known for the ""Vardon Grip"" which many golfers use as their main grip for holding a golf club.  The winner of six British Open Championships, Vardon was known for playing in stylish suits while on the course.Francis Ouimet came from a working class family and like Vardon, not treated well because he was simply a caddie and not from a distinguished family or a member of any wealthy golf Country Club.  But there were people who were supportive of his talent and gave him a chance to play at the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts.  His stunning win over the top British players at the 1913 US Open made him the first amateur to win the U.S. Open (Note: The first American to win the U.S. Open was John J. Mcdermott in 1911) and inspire many Americans to take up golf.  But most impressive that he never became a professional golfer and wanted to keep his status as an amateur golfer for the rest of his career.I also found the game of golf quite interesting back then.  I had no idea that when two people had to put.  If a ball went in front of a person's ball on the green, that the player behind the ball, still had to put.  So, I found it interesting to see Ouimet have to chip the ball over Vardon's ball in order to sink a put.  But most importantly, how heated the rivalry between the US and UK in terms of golf. Mainly, on the US side, due to the fact that the British were wining all the time.So, I actually enjoyed watching ""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" and learning about the history of golf but also finally knowing the significance Francis Ouimet had on the game of golf and why he is so highly regarded in the sport.""Overall, ""THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED"" is wonderful sports film that I highly recommend!",5,"Blu-ray: For those who enjoy sports films especially golf films, this movie was enjoyable to watch!",1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,10461,"['Golf', 'was', 'different', 'type',

83057,AIFXFHO2N9WJB,0788858408,"Justice0309 ""Justice""","[5, 5]","Sports themed movies generally do well at the box office because of their often uplifting and inspiring stories, and the ability to connect with audiences, allowing them to vicariously live out their athletic hopes and dreams for 2 hours.  This isn't to say that these audience members need to live vicariously through these inspiring sports movies, because some of these people could become the next sports stars that the rest of the general public will come to know and watch on TV, but for those that don't possess the ability to play professional sports, these movies are an excellent outlet for them to enjoy.After enjoying great success with several sports themed movies in recent years, from football with ""Remember the Titans"", baseball with ""The Rookie"", and hockey with the olympic-themed ""Miracle"", Walt Disney Studios decided to try their collective hand at the world of golf.  With a terrific script from Mark Frost, an enthusiastic director in former actor Bill Paxton (""Aliens"" and ""Twister""), and an up-and-coming young actor named Shia LaBeouf, who had gained notice from his Disney Channel TV show ""Even Stevens"" and his film work in ""I, Robot"" and ""Constantine"", Disney Studios was hard at work on delivering more high quality sports entertainment with ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"".Set in 1913, ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" is the story of a poor kid named Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf), who worked as a caddy at the country club across the street from his house.  Learning from watching the golfers he caddied for, young Ouimet began to hone his own golf skills, and though his father (Elias Koteas) vehemently disapproved, accepted a chance to play in an amatuer tournament.  Learning from the mistakes he makes, this young golfer and former caddy eventually earns a spot in the U.S. Open opposite his golf hero, and world's greatest golfer Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane).  With his hopes and dreams on the line and a 10-year old caddy named Eddie by his side, Francis sets out to break down the barriers of golf's high society, and do his best to win the U.S. Open Championship.What makes this movie so uplifting is the fact that young Francis had to overcome so much adversity to get to the U.S. Open.  From his disapproving father, played perfectly by Elias Koteas, to the high society golf members that looked down upon Francis' hopes of playing golf, and even his own self-doubts, nothing about his journey was easy.  But none of this stopped Francis from eventually making it to the U.S. Open to face off against Harry Vardon, who at the time was the greatest player in the game, and even to this day is known for perfecting the interlocking fingers grip used by most golfers.  The entire cast did an excellent job of bringing these real people to life and doing their story a great service by allowing many who'd never heard about the U.S. Open of 1913 to experience it first hand.  Director Bill Paxton does an extraordinary job of bringing the game of golf to exciting life on the big screen, many directors would have simply filmed the golf sequences as straightforward as possible, basically mimicing the PGA that airs on TV.  But Bill Paxton chose to liven things up, by incorporating unique camera angles and mixing digital and practical effects together to achieve a unique vision that portrays a great respect for not only the game of golf, but for it's players as well.Coming from a person that has grown up playing golf since I was a little kid, I can say that it's always nice when the actors in a sports movie try their hardest to make the movements appear authentic, and ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" features just that type of actors.  In fact, according to the behind-the-scenes featurette found on the DVD, all the actors that had parts requiring them to play golf on camera had to be trained to swing the club properly so that anyone viewing the movie that had any kind of golf experience would know that the swing was authentic, and could achieve the golf shots being portrayed on camera.  With that much dedication put into the pre-production process on this movie, and the high-caliber talent that were involved in the production process, and then the excellent post-production special effects work, music, and editing, it's no surprise that ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" has joined the pantheon of great Hollywood sports movies.  So, the next time you're out renting a movie, do yourself a favor and rent this one, you most definitely will not be disappointed!""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" is rated PG for brief

83058,ALLJT7S5QOFFZ,0788858408,kaduzy,"[10, 11]","I knew I'd like this movie because of Shia LaBeouf and Bill Paxton, both of whose work I admire.  I wasn't disappointed.  Paxton manages to infuse the sport of golf (which I normally find boring beyond description) with tension, drama and interest, and Shia's performance wins the day.  It has great supporting players, particularly Josh Flitter as his spunky caddie Eddie and Stephen Dillane as golf pro Harry Vardon.  The story is very uplifting and it's Disney-fied, to be sure, but this is the rare case of a story actually deserving that slightly gooey Disney touch, since it truly is a great underdog tale.  Paxton overdoes it a bit with the FX touches, using flashy camera moves at times when he could have easily played it straight, but overall he gets the job done, and gets the movie done right.The disc is a great treat because of one extra in particular: the interview with the real Francis Ouimet!  In 1963 he was filmed walking back through the course where he won his victory, and narrating exactly what happened.  It gets a little dry and technical at times and people like myself who don't know anything about golf will get a little lost during his more detailed descriptions of it, but it's a treasure nonetheless.  Hearing his own story from his own lips is priceless, and golf-enthusiasts and history buffs alike will be fascinated by his description of how the game of golf changed over the 50 years between his win and his interview.  I especially liked the lesson in the difference between golf clubs in 1913 vesus 1963.  The only thing that would've made it complete is if there was an extra highlighting the difference between 1960s-era clubs and modern-day ones.  I hate golf, but I love history.The other two extras are short, informative and sweet.  One tells the story of the two champs from a modern-day perspective, and the other is a behind-the-scenes look narrated by Bill Paxton that gives a brief overall view of the different elements that went into the movie.  And for die-hard fans of the movie, there are TWO separate commentary tracks, one by Paxton and one by the screenwriter, who also wrote the book the movie is based on (and has the same title).  In my opinion, these two should have combined forces to offer commentary together on one track.  You have to really LOVE the movie to sit through both of those, and I have to admit that I don't love it enough for that, but I'm sure they're pretty informative.  It's too bad that not one of the actors could join in.  Also absent is Stephen Dillane.  He doesn't appear in any interviews in any of the extras at all, which is a shame, because he was my favorite actor from the film.Overall, this is one you can watch with the whole family and it's well worth checking out.",4,"Golf is boring, this DVD is not.",1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,2762,"['knew', ""'d"", 'like', 'movie', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'work', 'admire', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'Paxton', 'infuse', 'sport', 'golf', 'normally', 'find', 'boring', 'description', 'tension', 'drama', 'interest', 'Shia', 'performance', 'day', 'great', 'supporting', 'players', 'particularly', 'Josh', 'Flitter', 'spunky', 'caddie', 'Eddie', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'golf', 'pro', 'Harry', 'Vardon', 'story', 'very', 'uplifting', 'Disney-fied', 'be', 'sure', 'rare', 'case', 'story', 'actually', 'deserving', 'slightly', 'gooey', 'Disney', 'touch', 'truly', 'great', 'underdog', 'tale', 'Paxton', 'bit', 'FX', 'touches', 'using', 'flashy', 'camera', 'moves', 'times', 'when', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'played', 'straight', 'overall', 'job', 'done', 'movie', 'done', 'right.The', 'disc', 'great', 'treat', 'one', 'extra', 'particular', 'interview', 'real', 'Francis', 'Ouimet', '1963', 'was', 'filmed', 'walking', 'back', 'course', 'where', 'won', 'victory', 'narrating', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'little', 'dry', 'technical', 'times', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'golf', 'will', 'get', 'little', 'lost', 'more', 'detailed', 'descriptions', 'treasure', 'nonetheless', 'Hearing', 'own', 'story', 'own', 'lips', 'priceless', 'golf-enthusiasts', 'history', 'buffs', 'alike', 'will', 'be', 'fascinated', 'description', 'how', 'game', 'golf', 'changed', '50', 'years', 'win', 'interview', 'especially', 'liked', 'lesson', 'difference', 'golf', 'clubs', '1913', 'vesus', '1963', 'only', 'thing', 'would', ""'ve"", 'made', 'complete', 'was', 'extra', 'highlighting', 'difference', '1960s-era', 'clubs', 'modern-day', 'ones', 'hate', 'golf', 'love', 'history.The', 'other', 'two', 'extras', 'are', 'short', 'informative', 'sweet', 'One', 'story', 'two', 'champs', 'modern-day', 'perspective', 'other', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'narrated', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'brief', 'overall', 'view', 'different', 'elements', 'went', 'movie', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'movie', 'are', 'TWO', 'separate', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'one', 'Paxton', 'one', 'screenwriter', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'same', 'title', 'opinion', 'two', 'should', 'have', 'combined', 'forces', 'offer', 'commentary', 'together', 'one', 'track', 'have', 'really', 'LOVE', 'movie', 'sit', 'have', 'admit', 'do', ""n't"", 'love', 'enough', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'re"", 'pretty', 'informative', 'too', 'bad', 'not', 'one', 'actors', 'could', 'join', 'Also', 'absent', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', ""n't"", 'appear', 'interviews', 'extras', 'shame', 'was', 'favorite', 'actor', 'film.Overall', 'one', 'can', 'watch', 'whole', 'family', 'well', 'worth', 'checking', 'out']",N/A

83060,A27CHILBK6HIL2,0788858408,Kaya Savas,"[3, 3]","MOVIE: Bill Paxton makes his sophomore feature directing attempt, and this time he does a complete switch of genre. His last film, Frailty, was a suspense film and now he is behind the wheel of a Disney film. I have to admit I went into this one with low expectations. I expected the typical run of the mill overcoming adversity story. Also, it's a movie about golf. The story is about Francis Ouimet, the youngest person to ever win the US Open. The film is not bad at all, and is actually an intriguing watch. Marc Foster wrote the screenplay based on his own book. Paxton's attention to detail really sells this as a period piece. It takes place during the early 1900's, and the audience feels like it's the early 1900's. The costume and production designs were very good. Paxton also does a fine job of directing even though some of the golfing sequences feel too out of place. I know they were trying to find different film techniques to make golf entertaining to watch, and even though they felt out of place they worked. The slow motion sequences in the rain are particularly noteworthy. Overall, this is a great film that anybody can enjoy. Just because it's PG and it's a Disney film doesn't mean it's aimed for the kiddies. In fact the young ones may get bored with this movie and not even understand some of it. The film has a running social commentary on the class systems. Francis starts as a caddy, a lower class citizen who defies customs and plays among the upper class. This class struggle helps to round the characters out and make them more dynamic, which in turn makes the film a compelling watch.ACTING: The acting in the film was also quite good. Shia LaBeouf stars as Francis and does a great job with the role. I didn't like him in I, Robot or Constantine, but I have to admit after seeing him in this role he looks to be a prominent star on the rise. The rest of the cast does an admirable job in the supporting roles and their performances help sell the golf scenes and make them entertaining to watch.BOTTOM LINE: What may look like another sports themed Disney film is actually a great and inspiring story about class struggle and the making of a new champion. Great performances and a great story make the film worth the time.",4,What May Seem As Another Uplifting Sports Story From Disney Is Actually A Great Film About Class Struggle,1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2255,"['MOVIE', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'sophomore', 'feature', 'directing', 'attempt', 'time', 'complete', 'switch', 'genre', 'last', 'film', 'Frailty', 'was', 'suspense', 'film', 'now', 'wheel', 'Disney', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'went', 'one', 'low', 'expectations', 'expected', 'typical', 'run', 'mill', 'overcoming', 'adversity', 'story', 'Also', 'movie', 'golf', 'story', 'Francis', 'Ouimet', 'youngest', 'person', 'ever', 'win', 'US', 'Open', 'film', 'not', 'bad', 'actually', 'intriguing', 'watch', 'Marc', 'Foster', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'based', 'own', 'book', 'Paxton', 'attention', 'detail', 'really', 'period', 'piece', 'place', 'early', '1900', 'audience', 'feels', 'early', '1900', 'costume', 'production', 'designs', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'Paxton', 'also', 'fine', 'job', 'directing', 'even', 'golfing', 'sequences', 'feel', 'too', 'place', 'know', 'were', 'trying', 'find', 'different', 'film', 'techniques', 'make', 'golf', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'even', 'felt', 'place', 'worked', 'slow', 'motion', 'sequences', 'rain', 'are', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'Overall', 'great', 'film', 'anybody', 'can', 'enjoy', 'Just', 'PG', 'Disney', 'film', ""n't"", 'mean', 'aimed', 'kiddies', 'fact', 'young', 'ones', 'may', 'get', 'bored', 'movie', 'not', 'even', 'understand', 'film', 'running', 'social', 'commentary', 'class', 'systems', 'Francis', 'caddy', 'lower', 'class', 'citizen', 'who', 'customs', 'plays', 'upper', 'class', 'class', 'struggle', 'round', 'characters', 'out', 'make', 'more', 'dynamic', 'turn', 'film', 'compelling', 'watch.ACTING', 'acting', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'quite', 'good', 'Shia', 'LaBeouf', 'Francis', 'great', 'job', 'role', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Robot', 'Constantine', 'have', 'admit', 'seeing', 'role', 'be', 'prominent', 'star', 'rise', 'rest', 'cast', 'admirable', 'job', 'supporting', 'roles', 'performances', 'help', 'sell', 'golf', 'scenes', 'make', 'entertaining', 'watch.BOTTOM', 'LINE', 'What', 'may', 'look', 'sports', 'themed', 'Disney', 'film', 'actually', 'great', 'inspiring', 'story', 'class', 'struggle', 'making', 'new', 'champion', 'Great', 'performances', 'great', 'story', 'make', 'film', 'time']",N/A

Francis is an immigrant's son in Boston, and knows only gentlemen are allowed to play golf.  But his idol, Harry Varden, was also a poor boy and he rose to become England's top professional golfer; Francis wants to do the same in America.  He manages to qualify for the U.S. Open and ends up playing head to head against Varden (Stephen Dillane) for the championship.This story has two protagonists, Ouimet and Varden; both are sympathetic and likeable characters, so it was hard to know who to root for (although the outcome is never in doubt).  Shia LaBeouf is very good as 20-year old Ouimet, and has a convincing golf swing.  Dillane is also quite watchable as the champ who is haunted by his past.

83065,A2NJO6YE954DBH,0788858408,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 3]","""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" refers to the true story of the playoff in the 1913 U.S. Open, in which 20-year-old Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf, ""Holes"") went up against the British golf champion Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane, ""The Hours"").  There was one other golfer in the playoff, and there were other golfers in the tournament, but the title and this 2005 movie both come down to Ouimet and Vardon.  The book on which it is based is, in full, ""The Greatest Game Ever Played: Harry Vardon, Francis Ouimet, and the Birth of Modern Golf.""  Mark Frost, who I first remember as a writer on ""Hill Street Blues"" and then later as the co-creator of ""Twin Peaks,"" wrote the book and then the screenplay.  As he constantly explains in his commentary track, there is a remarkable fidelity of the finished film to what really happened, apparently more so than any comparable sports film.  ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" calls itself the first underdog story in the history of American sports, but of course by now we have seen so many of those, from ""Seabiscuit"" to ""Glory Road"" (just to keep the focus on the last few years), that the oldest such tale can no longer seem new.  But that does not stop them from being effective on their own terms.Having recently watched ""Cinderella Man,"" where the underdog's opponent was personified as a vicious man-killer, it was refreshing to see that Vardon was not cast as a villain.  Frost's book is essentially a dual biography of Ouimet and Vardon, and while the movie clearly focuses more on Ouimet, there is ample reason to root for Vardon, who repeatedly proves himself to be the epitome of a good sportsman.  The parallels between the two are heightened in the movie, which portrays both as coming from poor families and running into the class prejudice against them daring to play a gentlemen's game.  Ouimet has to put up with the imposing barrier presented by his father (Elias Koteas), who strongly disapproves of his son playing a game, especially as an amateur who will not earn a dime from winning the U.S. Open.There is a sense in which Vardon and Ouimet are known by the company they keep.  Vardon has the misfortune of being urged on by Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth), a newspaper magnate who demands a British golfer win the U.S. Open cup for what anyone but a British lord would know are all the wrong reasons.  Meanwhile, fate saddles Ouimet at the last minute with a 10-year-old caddy, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter), who is half the size of the bag he has to carry.  But Eddie proves to be as wise beyond his years, while Northcliffe will never understand the game as long as he lives.  There is a minor sub-plot that verges on the romantic concerning Ouimet and a young society girl (Peyton List), but that ultimately becomes more a question of class and acceptance rather than love, and all such things take a backseat to the golf once the tournament begins.I did not keep a stopwatch on this movie, but it seemed like at least half of it takes place on the golf course.  Even if that is not true I suspect there is more happening on the links here than in either ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" or ""Bobby Jones: Stroke of Genius"" (or, for that matter, in either ""Caddyshack"" or ""Happy Gilmore"").  Knowing that he has a strong cast and solid performances from both LaBeouf and Dillane (especially while on the course), director Bill Paxton focuses his attention on period detail and on showing us golf in a way we have not seen before in the movies.  His creativity regarding the latter might become a bit too much, but he is certainly trying to bring something to the table.  For me the key shot was during the 4th round of the Open, when everybody's attention is on Ouimet.  Vardon and the other Brits are standing in the middle of the gallery and when Ouimet hits his shot every head turns to follow the ball--except Vardon's.  There is never an explicit recognition in the film of the fact that when Ouimet was seven, he got to meet Vardon and the champion showed him the proper way to grip the club.  But in this shot it becomes clear that Vardon knows they are playing the same game.I round up on the DVD because in addition to the ""On the Set of The Greatest Game Every Played"" featurette on the making of the movie, and the one that uses footage from the film to explain the historical background of the ""Two Legends and the Greatest Game,"" they have a really classy third extra.  ""From Caddy to Champion: Francis Ouimet"" was a special put out by a Boston television station in 1963, fifty years after this particular U.S. Open.  Filmed in black & white, the entire show is an interview with Ouimet, who shows us some of his mementoes (including not only the three balls used by the three players during the playoff but a copy that Dwight Eisenhower made of a painting of Ouimet showing him as the first American elected Captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews).  Ouimet shows us how golf clubs have changed over the years, and then walks the keys hole of the back nine on the course, explaining in some detail what happened where.  You see that and you wonder why it took Hollywood another forty years to make a movie about what happened at the Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1913.",5,The first underdog story in the

It's really about how class boundaries worked in 1913. Hollywood has launched yet another preachy ship onto the waves to educate us about how mean and nasty the upper classes are. Presumably this film will generate resentment and get us all ready for communism where there are no classes. Of course, any idiot knows communism is one of the most stratified of all systems, with self-appointed intellectuals like those who made this film ruling over the rest of us. Shia LaBeouf plays Francis Ouimet who in 1913 started off as a caddy and won the US Open. Instead of celebrating Mr Ouimet's achievement as an example of how anyone can achieve anything in America, the filmmakers instead spend the movie's capital showing how working men were snubbed by upper class snobs (and - gasp! - maybe still are!). Poor Ouimet, for instance, is harassed (very mildly and politely for harrassment) when he attends a dance to see a pretty girl he likes. Poor widdle baby. We should note, not in passing, that THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is not only deceptive as to its true subject matter but that it is no SEA BISCUIT. This film is slow-moving and boring and doesn't have the dramatic gravitas of a SEA BISCUIT or the writing and directing of better sports movies.

Carlson ""The Highly Unlikely""","[5, 5]","When my ten year old son saw that we were putting this DVD into the machine he threw a screamy fit, ""Not that movie! I don't want to watch that movie!""By the end of the film, hole 18, last putt, Francis is ahead by only one stroke, my son was on the edge of his seat with everyone else.I didn't want to see ""The Greatest Game Ever Played"" at first myself. When it first came out I could not believe that a young actor with the incredible talent Shia LaBeouf demonstrated in ""Holes"" didn't have a better movie to star in than some snoozer about a game of golf. Golf, I thought, is one of the most useless games mankind has invented.This film changed my mind. I can see now that golf has a certain simple charm. You hit a ball with a stick and try to get it to roll into a hole. Even my two-year-old could understand what was happening in this movie. He stood right in front of the screen and jumped up and down and cheered every time the ball went in.I can't say enough about the impressive cinematography, from the opening titles to the last time we see Vardon get into his zone, making everything melt away except the flag at the far end of the green. The acting was good, the pacing was a little slow in places, but I tell you, we were all holding our breath there at the end.As for family friendliness, there was only one case of biblical swearing, and that by a very non-sympathetic character. We all booed him. Best of all, this film sparked a great family discussion on good sportsmanship, which was shown by both Vardon and Ouimet.The one thing I did not like about the film was the antagonistic father character. Why is it that the dad in these sorts of movies insists that the son to do something practical with his life rather than pursue his dreams? Do any parents really do that? Granted, my mom used to get after me for sitting in bed all morning working on my meta-science-fiction graphic novel instead of cleaning my room, and my dad once suggested to me that engineering would be a more practical course than physics, but in general they always encouraged me to develop my talents and pursue my interests. Maybe I'm lucky to have really nice parents.But anyhow, it disturbed me that in ""Greatest Game"" dad made son promise to give up golf, and then son had to go and break promise in order to enter tournament and win first place. It wasn't fair of dad to extract the promise, but that was no excuse to go and break it. We talked about that issue with the children too. And what irks me most was that, in real life, Francis Ouimet's father was probably just fine with his son playing golf!

83099,ATB8MP2M9L5PM,0788858408,"Transcendental Thomist ""jeb815""","[0, 0]","This 121-minute Disney film (2006) tells the true story of amateur U.S. golfer Francis Ouimet's upset victory in the 1913 U.S. Open over British champion Harry Vardon. Like most Disney sports films, it errs on the side of goofy sentiment, rolling out the usual cliches of class warfare (poverty triumphing over uncaring tycoons) and daddy issues (the uncaring and harsh dad initially opposed to his son's athletic dreams) in addition to over-reliance on a cute child actor. Much like &#34;The Rookie&#34; and &#34;Glory Road,&#34; it is a decent flick that comes across a tad bland and generic, being more pleasant in tone than memorable, but it also boasts some bright spots.On the positive side, director Bill Paxton has given his film an unusually strong cast and production values, as the period authenticity and performances are especially sharp. Young Shia Labeouf acquits himself serviceably as the determined young man, but Stephen Dillane steals the show from him as Harry Vardon, the reigning golf champion with similar working-class roots who turns out to be a class act himself. Unlike Ron Howard's film &#34;Cinderella Man,&#34; where Russell Crowe's Jewish boxing opponent was portrayed as a deplorable thug much to the consternation of his descendants, this film scores points for giving us the real-life Vardon rather than a &#34;bad guy&#34; caricature. Paxton films the golf sequences with a welcome visual flare, using bright colors and some neat digital effects (particularly the sequences where Vardon &#34;zones out&#34; distractions and demons before taking a shot) to present the game of golf in a fresh way.On the negative side, Disneyfied cliches still abound here. Elias Koteas does a nice job in his underwritten role as Labeouf's working-class French Canadian father, but their relationship is under-explored as the &#34;daddy issues&#34; cliche is worked out in the most unimaginative way possible, almost seeming lifted from &#34;The Rookie.&#34; The father-mother dynamics (Ouimet's mother was Irish) are likewise presented in a predictable fashion, without any sense that we are watching a real family interact. Finally, the British nobility who support Vardon are portrayed as moustache-twirling villains who are dead set on using golf to assert their superiority over the lower classes, over-playing the film's underlying stereotypes of the noble poor and uncaring rich. Finally, the absolute worst aspect of the movie is Ouimet's 10-year old caddy, a real-life touch that is initially amusing before the screenplay sets him up as the all-wise sage who continually gives Ouimet the right advice about how to play -- even in the film's climactic scene on the last hole. After awhile, this kid's frequent 21st century-style wisecracks become a frequent distraction and reminder that we are watching a calculated product of Disney's manufactured inspiration factory. A little bit less from the caddy would have gone a long way here, keeping the audience from being pulled out of the movie's otherwise meticulous world. The religious aspect (both Vardon and Ouimet were Catholics) is also underplayed, being dropped after an early reference to Vardon's membership in the &#34;Church of Rome&#34; being an obstacle to his club membership in Britain.The DVD is a nice edition that features numerous commentaries and making-of videos, including a neat B&W; documentary featuring the real Ouimet talking about his victory in later life. It's not a great film, but it's decent.

Even though it's a little slow, you should rent this movie, because you see how perserverance really works, and it's inspiring.

83102,A2OUNY4NE7HYMQ,0788858408,Valerie Garner,"[10, 12]","This is based upon a true story of a poor boy living across the street from an exclusive golf course in the 1930's who caddied as a boy.  He was found to have a rare natural talent for golf when some of the local gentlemen saw his skill.  His dad was very against the pursuit of golf, thinking it to be a waste of time and that it was senseless to have dreams, but more valuable to go to work.  He ended up ultimately joining the US open tournament as winning against huge odds and very little support.I love movies based on true stories, and I did really like this film.  The one drawback for me, is it seemed slow paced and a sense that they had to really draw it out to make it the length of a movie.  I also didn't like that the main character didn't express what was going on with him very much, I believe that part could have been filled out more and made it more interesting.Overall, I'd recommend the movie, especially if you like golf and sporting films based on true stories.

83104,A1C80B497LCYKA,0788858408,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[13, 13]","To fully appreciate THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED, it's good to compare it with BOBBY JONES, STROKE OF GENIUS. Both films cost between $20M and $25M. Both were about the game of golf at the turn of the 20th century. Both focused on young, underprivileged underdogs who went on to become the best amateurs in the game, beating out their professional competition. And both show the influence of the great Harry Vardon.BOBBY JONE, STROKE OF GENIUS, of course, is about Bobby Jones, only amateur ever to win all three tournaments of the Grand Slam in the same year. And he did it while also working on three college degrees simultaneously - thus the ""Genius."" Jim Caviezel (Passion of the Christ) did a decent job playing Bobby, although he didn't look anything like the man. And Aiden Quinn was good as Harry Vardon - even down to his golfing ability - although he was all but cut from the film because he wouldn't shave a goatee he had grown for another film.While BOBBY JONES is about an entire golf career, THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is about one tournament: the 1913 US Open, held at Brookline Country Club in Brookline, Massachusetts. That was the year that a caddie - Francis Ouimet, who lived across the street from the country club - beat the two top British professionals, including Harry Vardon, and won the tournament - the biggest upset in golf history. Shia LeBeouf (Holes) does a great job playing Ouimet, and Stephen Dillane (The Hours) is superb as Vardon.The biggest difference between these two films is in the direction. With BOBBY JONES, Rowdy Herrington (Road House) opted to do a very straight drama in the tradition of Chariots of Fire. It turned out to be far more than he could handle. The script is weak. There is far too much time spent on the young Bobby Jones, which contributes very little to the main plot. And visually, it is, well, boring. There are only a handful of creatively interesting shots.But in THE GREATEST GAME, director Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, acting) pulls out all the stops. Not only is the script taut, but every part of it is essential. And the visuals are incredible, including effects that have never been seen in a sports film before, let alone one about golf. The art direction - including sets, costumes and graphics - is also superb, creating a totally believable and visually sumptuous world. You don't have to love golf to love this movie. That can't be said about BOBBY JONES. While both films have heart, THE GREATEST GAME also has fun.When I first saw THE GREATEST GAME, there were a couple of things that bothered me. I didn't feel the love relationship between Francis and Sarah Wallis (Peyton List) was believable because their ages seemed so different. I just couldn't see her falling for a boy. I also had trouble accepting a ten-year-old caddy, Eddie Lowery, played like a true ham by Josh Flitter. It seemed like a typical Disney element (the kid who is smarter than the adults that surround him), and I just didn't buy into it. Then I discovered that that really was the way it was! Which doesn't make it any easier to believe, but at least it's true.These are two very different films about similar events. While BOBBY JONES STROKE OF GENIUS is a good film (3 to 4 stars), THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED is a great film (5 stars). Both directors had a vision; but Bill Paxton has proven that he can carry his out.Waitsel Smith",5,BILL PAXTON PULLS OUT ALL THE STOPS,1148256000,"05 22, 2006",2006,3394,"['fully', 'appreciate', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'EVER', 'PLAYED', 'good', 'compare', 'BOBBY', 'JONES', 'STROKE', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'films', 'cost', '20M', '25M', 'were', 'game', 'golf', 'turn', '20th', 'century', 'focused', 'young', 'underprivileged', 'underdogs', 'who', 'went', 'become', 'best', 'amateurs', 'game', 'beating', 'out', 'professional', 'competition', 'show', 'influence', 'great', 'Harry', 'Vardon.BOBBY', 'JONE', 'STROKE', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'course', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'only', 'amateur', 'ever', 'win', 'three', 'tournaments', 'Grand', 'Slam', 'same', 'year', 'did', 'also', 'working', 'three', 'college', 'degrees', 'simultaneously', 'thus', 'Genius', 'Jim', 'Caviezel', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'did', 'decent', 'job', 'playing', 'Bobby', 'did', ""n't"", 'look', 'anything', 'man', 'Aiden', 'Quinn', 'was', 'good', 'Harry', 'Vardon', 'even', 'down', 'golfing', 'ability', 'was', 'cut', 'film', 'would', ""n't"", 'shave', 'goatee', 'had', 'grown', 'film.While', 'BOBBY', 'JONES', 'entire', 'golf', 'career', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'EVER', 'PLAYED', 'one', 'tournament', '1913', 'US', 'Open', 'held', 'Brookline', 'Country', 'Club', 'Brookline', 'Massachusetts', 'was', 'year', 'caddie', 'Francis', 'Ouimet', 'who', 'lived', 'street', 'country', 'club', 'beat', 'two', 'top', 'British', 'professionals', 'including', 'Harry', 'Vardon', 'won', 'tournament', 'biggest', 'upset', 'golf', 'history', 'Shia', 'LeBeouf', 'Holes', 'great', 'job', 'playing', 'Ouimet', 'Stephen', 'Dillane', 'Hours', 'superb', 'Vardon.The', 'biggest', 'difference', 'two', 'films', 'direction', 'BOBBY', 'JONES', 'Rowdy', 'Herrington', 'Road', 'House', 'opted', 'do', 'very', 'straight', 'drama', 'tradition', 'Chariots', 'Fire', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'could', 'handle', 'script', 'weak', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'young', 'Bobby', 'Jones', 'very', 'little', 'main', 'plot', 'visually', 'well', 'boring', 'are', 'only', 'handful', 'creatively', 'interesting', 'shots.But', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'director', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'Apollo', '13', 'acting', 'out', 'stops', 'Not', 'only', 'script', 'taut', 'part', 'essential', 'visuals', 'are', 'incredible', 'including', 'effects', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'sports', 'film', 'let', 'alone', 'one', 'golf', 'art', 'direction', 'including', 'sets', 'costumes', 'graphics', 'also', 'superb', 'creating', 'totally', 'believable', 'visually', 'sumptuous', 'world', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'love', 'golf', 'love', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'said', 'BOBBY', 'JONES', 'films', 'have', 'heart', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'also', 'fun.When', 'first', 'saw', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'were', 'couple', 'things', 'bothered', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'love', 'relationship', 'Francis', 'Sarah', 'Wallis', 'Peyton', 'List', 'was', 'believable', 'ages', 'seemed', 'so', 'different', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'see', 'falling', 'boy', 'also', 'had', 'trouble', 'accepting', 'ten-year-old', 'caddy', 'Eddie', 'Lowery', 'played', 'true', 'ham', 'Josh', 'Flitter', 'seemed', 'typical', 'Disney', 'element', 'kid', 'who', 'smarter', 'adults', 'surround', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'Then', 'discovered', 'really', 'was', 'way', 'was', 'Which', ""n't"", 'make', 'easier', 'believe', 'least', 'true.These', 'are', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'films', 'similar', 'events', 'BOBBY', 'JONES', 'STROKE', 'OF', 'GENIUS', 'good', 'film', '3', '4', 'stars', 'THE', 'GREATEST', 'GAME', 'EVER', 'PLAYED', 'great', 'film', '5', 'stars', 'directors', 'had', 'vision', 'Bill', 'Paxton', 'proven', 'can', 'carry', 'out.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A
