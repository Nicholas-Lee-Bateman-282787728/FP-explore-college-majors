1455502,A17B55N0YVR48L,B005DEUEWM,Gary M. Gerani,"[41, 48]","To begin with, Amazon/Timeless tells us that what we're ordering is in color (check above description), but what we actually receive is in black-and-white.  Moreover, T's description claims that re-mastered transfers were utilized for this release, which is simply not true.  These are old, slightly dirty 16mm prints, a throwback to the company's junk releases (RIVERBOAT, THE TALL MAN, M SQUAD) and far below industry standards.  Obviously Timeless hoped that TV fans hooked on the superb 35mm quality of THE VIRGINIAN episodes (which were legitimately re-mastered for their run on Encore, with T ultimately getting the benefit), would assume that this Universal western series from the same period would look comparable.  Nope.  16mm back-up prints, and b/w besides.  Sadly, the show's pretty flat as a creative entertainment to begin with, but the proper presentation would have gone a long way toward making a guilty pleasure purchase like this acceptable.  A little bit of a mystery here: WAS this series shot in color?  Update: The pilot, presented here in b/w, was shot in Pathe color, according to the credit in the end titles.  All the other episodes (at least the ones viewed so far) were filmed in b/w.  My guess is that the color pilot sold the series, but ABC didn't feel like financing color for the twelve additional episodes.  As a result of this, some sources (Retro-TV western sites, Amazon, Timeless) incorrectly categorize DESTRY as a color series, while others (IMDb, Wikipedia) say b/w, but don't explain that a) the pilot was shot in color, and b) whether or not this first hour was actually broadcast on the ABC network in color.  For the record, the 16mm prints used for this release are NOT used syndie prints (DESTRY was too brief a series to make it into syndication); these old 16mm back-ups have probably been gathering dust in Uni vaults for years, but don't have the wear and tear on them that other sub-par Timeless releases are cursed with (as mentioned, M SQUAD is practically unwatchable).  Bottom line: If you're gonna go Timeless for classic Universal westerns, stick to THE VIRGINIAN and WAGON TRAIN (magnificent 35mm re-mastered material) and the upcoming MEN FROM SHILOH, which was probably prepared in a similar quality fashion (it's been out in Europe for a few years, so I imagine Timeless is using the same masters).",1,"Amazon, correct those false statements!",1316736000,"09 23, 2011",2011,2362,"['begin', 'Amazon/Timeless', 'what', ""'re"", 'ordering', 'color', 'check', 'description', 'what', 'actually', 'receive', 'black-and-white', 'Moreover', 'T', 'description', 're-mastered', 'transfers', 'were', 'utilized', 'release', 'simply', 'not', 'true', 'are', 'old', 'slightly', '16mm', 'prints', 'throwback', 'company', 'junk', 'releases', 'RIVERBOAT', 'THE', 'TALL', 'MAN', 'M', 'SQUAD', 'far', 'industry', 'standards', 'Obviously', 'Timeless', 'hoped', 'TV', 'fans', 'hooked', 'superb', '35mm', 'quality', 'THE', 'VIRGINIAN', 'episodes', 'were', 'legitimately', 're-mastered', 'run', 'Encore', 'T', 'ultimately', 'getting', 'benefit', 'would', 'assume', 'Universal', 'western', 'series', 'same', 'period', 'would', 'look', 'comparable', 'Nope', '16mm', 'back-up', 'prints', 'b/w', 'besides', 'Sadly', 'show', 'pretty', 'flat', 'creative', 'entertainment', 'begin', 'proper', 'presentation', 'would', 'have', 'gone', 'long', 'way', 'making', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'purchase', 'acceptable', 'little', 'bit', 'mystery', 'here', 'WAS', 'series', 'shot', 'color', 'Update', 'pilot', 'presented', 'here', 'b/w', 'was', 'shot', 'Pathe', 'color', 'according', 'credit', 'end', 'titles', 'other', 'episodes', 'least', 'ones', 'viewed', 'so', 'far', 'were', 'filmed', 'b/w', 'guess', 'color', 'pilot', 'sold', 'series', 'ABC', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'financing', 'color', 'twelve', 'additional', 'episodes', 'result', 'sources', 'Retro-TV', 'western', 'sites', 'Amazon', 'Timeless', 'incorrectly', 'categorize', 'DESTRY', 'color', 'series', 'others', 'IMDb', 'Wikipedia', 'say', 'b/w', 'do', ""n't"", 'explain', 'pilot', 'was', 'shot', 'color', 'b', 'not', 'first', 'hour', 'was', 'actually', 'broadcast', 'ABC', 'network', 'color', 'record', '16mm', 'prints', 'used', 'release', 'are', 'NOT', 'used', 'syndie', 'prints', 'DESTRY', 'was', 'too', 'brief', 'series', 'make', 'syndication', 'old', '16mm', 'back-ups', 'have', 'probably', 'been', 'gathering', 'dust', 'Uni', 'vaults', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'wear', 'tear', 'other', 'sub-par', 'Timeless', 'releases', 'are', 'cursed', 'mentioned', 'M', 'SQUAD', 'practically', 'unwatchable', 'Bottom', 'line', ""'re"", 'gon', 'go', 'Timeless', 'classic', 'Universal', 'westerns', 'stick', 'THE', 'VIRGINIAN', 'WAGON', 'TRAIN', 'magnificent', '35mm', 're-mastered', 'material', 'upcoming', 'MEN', 'FROM', 'SHILOH', 'was', 'probably', 'prepared', 'similar', 'quality', 'fashion', 'been', 'out', 'Europe', 'few', 'years', 'imagine', 'Timeless', 'using', 'same', 'masters']",Destry: The Complete Series - 13 Episodes!
