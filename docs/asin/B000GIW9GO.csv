Estella's character is &#34;ready&#34; so it's not a bunch of will they, won't they to distract from the movie. Instead, it opens with her planning the virginal romantic getaway only to have an A-hole boyfriend mess things up and the comedy ensues from here.Oddly, my favorite relationship wasn't fully explored. It was the relationship between Jeanna (Warren) and the firefighters who seemed to be willing to help her get revenge on her A-hole ex.

Unfortunately, the only good scenes (such as they were) were in the trailer. The movie sleep-walked through a series of brief episodes that made engagement with the characters virtually impossible. The script was derivative, borrowing from much better movies, and the directing and editing were poor. We were also distracted by the main character's being dressed in high school tops and skirts that revealed her middle instead of decent adult attire. We decided the director did that because the actress is not particularly beautiful and he was trying to give her some sex appeal. Unfortunately, we never succeeded in liking her character. The final outcome was predictable from the point when we met the man she ends up with.
