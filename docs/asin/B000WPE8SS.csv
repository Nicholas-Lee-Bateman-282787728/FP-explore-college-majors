1111197,AIMR915K4YCN,B000WPE8SS,"Bindy Sue Frnknschtein ""bigfootsalienbaby""","[0, 0]","I love both Jennifer Carpenter (EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, QUARANTINE, TV's DEXTER) and Stacey Dash (GHOST IMAGE), so, GRAYSON ARMS (aka: LETHAL EVICTION) is a real treat! The title apartment house is packed w/ interesting characters, including an obsessive psychiatrist (Judd Nelson from RELENTLESS), an old bigot-lady (Michael Learned), a transvestite, and a trio of dopers. Ms. Carpenter gets the most screen-time, playing a multiple role. Ms. Dash plays the new landlord, plagued by the ""accidental"" deaths of most of her tenants! Michael Bowen (KILL BILL 1 and THE LOST) plays the investigating cop. ARMS is an above-average thriller w/ enough weirdness to hold my attention...",4,Jennifer Carpenter AND Stacey Dash!...,1312934400,"08 10, 2011",2011,679,"['love', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'EXORCISM', 'OF', 'EMILY', 'ROSE', 'QUARANTINE', 'TV', 'DEXTER', 'Stacey', 'Dash', 'GHOST', 'IMAGE', 'so', 'GRAYSON', 'ARMS', 'aka', 'LETHAL', 'EVICTION', 'real', 'treat', 'title', 'apartment', 'house', 'packed', 'interesting', 'characters', 'including', 'obsessive', 'psychiatrist', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'RELENTLESS', 'old', 'bigot-lady', 'Michael', 'Learned', 'transvestite', 'trio', 'dopers', 'Ms.', 'Carpenter', 'most', 'screen-time', 'playing', 'multiple', 'role', 'Ms', 'Dash', 'new', 'landlord', 'plagued', 'accidental', 'deaths', 'most', 'tenants', 'Michael', 'Bowen', 'KILL', 'BILL', '1', 'THE', 'LOST', 'investigating', 'cop', 'ARMS', 'above-average', 'thriller', 'w/', 'enough', 'weirdness', 'hold', 'attention']",Grayson Arms

This movie is worth it for that reason alone. The actual script had potential, as far as the storyline goes, but no budget to speak of I imagine.Cons: Everything else. Oh, it's Judd Nelson alright, but it ain't vintage...I whole heartedly recommend this for Jennifer Carpenter, she has some serious chops. She's kinda hot in this movie, too, depending on what character she is playing.Get it, you have nothing better to do.",3,Wowzer!,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,531,"['Pros', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'early', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'work', 'very', 'interesting', 'say', 'least', 'movie', 'reason', 'alone', 'actual', 'script', 'had', 'potential', 'as', 'far', 'storyline', 'budget', 'speak', 'imagine.Cons', 'Everything', 'else', 'Oh', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'alright', 'ai', ""n't"", 'vintage', 'whole', 'heartedly', 'recommend', 'Jennifer', 'Carpenter', 'serious', 'chops', 'kinda', 'hot', 'movie', 'too', 'depending', 'what', 'character', 'playing.Get', 'have', 'nothing', 'better', 'do']",Grayson Arms

1111201,A387BD735MI50R,B000WPE8SS,R. Schultz,"[1, 1]","Here's yet another movie that felt impelled to convey cool by having a host of pointlessly antagonist characters cursing each other at the drop of a hat. Then Judd Nelson as its lead character was presumably meant to lend an additional quality of hip with his hairdo. It's an odd mix of inadvertent morning dishevelment and studied punk - not something a professional psychologist such as he's playing would be likely to sport in public. All it does is introduce a distracting irrelevancy every time Nelson is on screen.If you can make your way through this thicket though - of bristling lupine hair and bristling tempers - there is actually something worthwhile about this film.You might think you can see the resolution coming a mile away. But wait. You have to hang in until the very last moments of the last scene, and indeed until the very last sentence of that last scene, in order to get the full impact of what might otherwise be dismissed as a too-common twist. When you hear it, its relative inventiveness reflects back well on the film as a whole and makes ""Grayson Arms"" a place to at least briefly rent after all.",3,You Could Do Worse Than To EmbraceThis,1206144000,"03 22, 2008",2008,1126,"['Here', 'yet', 'movie', 'felt', 'impelled', 'convey', 'cool', 'having', 'host', 'pointlessly', 'antagonist', 'characters', 'cursing', 'other', 'drop', 'hat', 'Then', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'lead', 'character', 'was', 'presumably', 'meant', 'lend', 'additional', 'quality', 'hip', 'hairdo', 'odd', 'mix', 'inadvertent', 'morning', 'dishevelment', 'studied', 'punk', 'not', 'something', 'professional', 'psychologist', 'such', 'playing', 'would', 'be', 'likely', 'sport', 'public', 'introduce', 'distracting', 'irrelevancy', 'time', 'Nelson', 'screen.If', 'can', 'make', 'way', 'thicket', 'bristling', 'lupine', 'hair', 'bristling', 'tempers', 'actually', 'something', 'worthwhile', 'film.You', 'might', 'think', 'can', 'see', 'resolution', 'coming', 'mile', 'away', 'wait', 'have', 'hang', 'very', 'last', 'moments', 'last', 'scene', 'indeed', 'very', 'last', 'sentence', 'last', 'scene', 'order', 'get', 'full', 'impact', 'what', 'might', 'otherwise', 'be', 'dismissed', 'too-common', 'twist', 'When', 'hear', 'relative', 'inventiveness', 'back', 'well', 'film', 'whole', 'Grayson', 'Arms', 'place', 'least', 'briefly', 'rent']",Grayson Arms

That said, it was an interesting melange. After a few years of not liking Jennifer Carpenter I had a stint of considering her eh, and then one day i realized i really like her. As in, a lot. So yeah, high marks there. I agree with a previous reviewer that she not only showed the acting chops in this one, but she looked really good in doing so.So yeah, this had an interesting plotline, a mix of characters making it happen, and the requisite twists and turns. The ending was cool, and when the credits rolled I was said ""job well done""  aloud, even though no one else was in the room.
