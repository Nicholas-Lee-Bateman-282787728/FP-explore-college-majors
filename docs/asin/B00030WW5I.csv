Jennifer Connely is Jennifer Corvino, a young girl at a swiss boarding school w/ the ability to communicate w/ insects telepathically. She also has odd dreams and nightly bouts of somnambulism. Jennifer finds herself in the middle of a murder mystery when a madman begins killing other young girls. With the help of a kindly entomologist (Donald Pleasance), Jennifer sets out to reveal the identity of the killer. I actually like this movie a lot. The idea of ""talking"" to bugs may sound ridiculous, but it works! Connely is able to pull it off with ease. If you liked SUSPIRIA, then you'll enjoy this one. As in other Argento films, there is a perfect mixture of beauty and savagery.

You know when you are watching a Dario Argento film.  This movie is one of my favorites from the great Italian filmmaker.  Jennifer Connelly is great and you see why she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today, let's hope she stays away from Dark Water type pics though.  I would HIGHLY recommend this film to any horror fan.  I don't own it but it will be the crown jewel of my Dario Argento Collection.

It's an italian movie, and parts of it seem like it's dubbed, but I really thought it was done very well. Donald Pleasant actually was great, it was nice to see him in another movie besides all the HALLOWEEN movies. Jennifer Connenly (sp?) gives a great performance to, as a girl who is sent to a boarding school. She has a very weird, but special talent. She can call and communicate with insects. There are murders happening all around the school, a killer who is after young girls...mainly tourists. The movie keeps a good pace, and the end has a great twist.

854477,A96JD9312DHWC,B00030WW5I,"TorridlyBoredShopper ""T(to the)B(to the)S""","[3, 3]","A series of grizzly murders begin to take place, and an entomologist (Donald Pleasance) looking into the mating patterns of insects, thereby checking out the times and the settings of these killings, befriends the insect-friendly Jennifer Connelly. While dealing with Connelly and some things that happen to her locally, he finds that she has a strange ability - she basically produced a pheromone that attracts male insects and makes them bend to her will. This leads to some rather interesting moments where Connelly, the ""new girl"" at a rather snobbish school, flexes some insect muscle and creates some rather frightening moments. She also becomes involved in the murders directly, and the killer v. bug-lady battle ensues.Dario Argento made some of the best Italian films of the 70s/80s/90s, and really handles the slasher genre well. He takes stories and makes them more than they should be, turning the dial on what could be mundane and making it bizarre enough to keep a person watching. He also knows how to handle the wonderful world of gore in ways that make horror fans salivate, and his experience with multiple genres lead to movies like the one listed here.For fans of Argento and for people not wanting to watch a movie cut to make it fit the standards of early US importation, it needs to be noted that this is really the movie Phenomena with the film cut up. Yeah, Creepers is really something of a disgrace when you look at what is done to it, making a movie that isn't that terrible more tame than it should be and creating a dilemma of sorts. While Phenomena, hands down, is the best way to see the film, Creepers is still in-print and the OOP cost of the first versus the five spot touch of the second really makes Creepers a lot more appealing than it had been in years past. It also isn't THAT BADLY cut up; that is to say that it is about fifteen minutes light and the stuff that is missing isn't going to make you hate the thing you purchased. I was actually surprised by that; most of the movies that combine the words ""Italian"" and ""chopped up"" are something to avoid. This isn't even close to being that, however, and actually scores a really good grade.For fans of Argento this is a good tool to pass the time until someone (hopefully Anchor Bay) notices the lack of releases by Fulci and Argento and decides to kick out something for the needy. I personally find myself happy with Creepers - considering - and would actually recommend it to people that need their Argento fix but can't find that Argento price.As I said before, you don't lose tooo much of the movie and will be satisfied with what you take home.",5,Beastly v.
