457223,ASYM4A70K9OMU,6305265712,beachbutterfly,"[9, 12]","I first saw this movie while flipping around channels on HBO and while at first, it did not catch my attention for reasons I shall yet to understand. Once I really did start to get into the film however, I was totally drawn into it. I understand that many reviewers here were absolutely mortified upon finishing the movie (if any of them actually gave it that long of a chance) but, honestly knowing nothing of Polish culture, did not take anything ""racial"" from the movie; rather, I just saw a funny, and genuinely honest story that wanted to be told.The story focuses on the bizarre life of a large family simply trying to stay afloat in both financial and social situations of their life. Claire Danes (Hala) plays a beautiful but rebellious young girl who puts out a ""pure"" act in front of those who don't know her well (like the Church). Her father, Bolek, an honest and prideful baker, who is well aware of his family's problems (and secretly, while never blantly said of, his wife's affair), struggles to put up a brave front while dealing with family issues. In the movie Hala is impregnanted by the same police man who pulled her over for breaking curfew (or another unsaid reason). Hala's mother is infuriated and when Hala's lover refuses her offer of marriage several times, takes things into her own hands and drags along Hala's many older brothers to beat him up.In the mist of the fury, Hala is chosen to represent the innocence and purity of the Virgin Mary by her church. Although Hala puts up a happy and brave front for her family, her peers ridicule her for it and eventually screw the parade as they chant obscenities to her. As Hala approaches the statue of the Virgin Mary, she questions why she was chosen and in an act of pure mockery (or more so, something only a rebellious girl could do), takes the crown she was to place on Mary's head and tops it on her own, crying out, ""Put this in your pipe and smoke it!"" She is punished but the movie does not get off easily without a good end; Hala (I am assuming, as the way this movie ends) marries the dull and emotionally-challeneged police man and gives birth to their baby boy and all is good once again.This movie is not without it's imperfections; it is rather slow and the plot seems to be going absolutely nowhere at times yet, the honest portrayal of the family is so stunningly dramatic that I often found myself just staring at the TV screen in disbelief (both good and bad). I can see why many of the reviewers here are infuriated and while it can be a little too much, Polish Wedding is realistic: the eight year old soon is addicted to cigarattes, the beautiful wife is an adultress and the rebellious daughter seems to get away with everything.I found this movie to be rather enjoyable. It's not like many other realistic cultural movies where it shows an actual portrayal of a certain lifestyle but like I said before, while I'm not an expert at the Polish culture, I can tell it's only trying to poke fun, not be racist. I didn't walk away thinking this was how all Polish acted. Then again, the message I'm getting from the Polish reviewers here is this: if ""Polish Wedding"" is attempting to be racist by going over the top, couldn't the same by said for ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", which is merely ""poking fun"" of it's own cultural traditions?",4,Put this in your pipe and smoke it!,1105574400,"01 13, 2005",2005,3333,"['first', 'saw', 'movie', 'flipping', 'around', 'channels', 'HBO', 'first', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'attention', 'reasons', 'shall', 'yet', 'understand', 'Once', 'really', 'did', 'start', 'get', 'film', 'however', 'was', 'totally', 'drawn', 'understand', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'were', 'absolutely', 'mortified', 'finishing', 'movie', 'actually', 'gave', 'long', 'chance', 'honestly', 'knowing', 'nothing', 'Polish', 'culture', 'did', 'not', 'take', 'anything', 'racial', 'movie', 'rather', 'just', 'saw', 'funny', 'genuinely', 'honest', 'story', 'wanted', 'be', 'told.The', 'story', 'focuses', 'bizarre', 'life', 'large', 'family', 'simply', 'trying', 'stay', 'afloat', 'financial', 'social', 'situations', 'life', 'Claire', 'Danes', 'Hala', 'beautiful', 'rebellious', 'young', 'girl', 'who', 'out', 'pure', 'act', 'front', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'well', 'Church', 'father', 'Bolek', 'honest', 'prideful', 'baker', 'who', 'well', 'aware', 'family', 'problems', 'secretly', 'never', 'blantly', 'said', 'wife', 'affair', 'put', 'up', 'brave', 'front', 'dealing', 'family', 'issues', 'movie', 'Hala', 'impregnanted', 'same', 'police', 'man', 'who', 'pulled', 'over', 'breaking', 'curfew', 'unsaid', 'reason', 'Hala', 'mother', 'infuriated', 'when', 'Hala', 'lover', 'offer', 'marriage', 'several', 'times', 'things', 'own', 'hands', 'drags', 'Hala', 'many', 'older', 'brothers', 'beat', 'up.In', 'mist', 'fury', 'Hala', 'chosen', 'represent', 'innocence', 'purity', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'church', 'Hala', 'up', 'happy', 'brave', 'front', 'family', 'peers', 'ridicule', 'eventually', 'screw', 'parade', 'chant', 'obscenities', 'Hala', 'statue', 'Virgin', 'Mary', 'questions', 'why', 'was', 'chosen', 'act', 'pure', 'mockery', 'more', 'so', 'something', 'only', 'rebellious', 'girl', 'could', 'do', 'crown', 'was', 'place', 'Mary', 'head', 'own', 'crying', 'out', 'Put', 'pipe', 'smoke', 'punished', 'movie', 'not', 'get', 'off', 'easily', 'good', 'end', 'Hala', 'am', 'assuming', 'way', 'movie', 'dull', 'emotionally-challeneged', 'police', 'man', 'birth', 'baby', 'boy', 'good', 'once', 'again.This', 'movie', 'not', 'imperfections', 'rather', 'slow', 'plot', 'be', 'going', 'absolutely', 'nowhere', 'times', 'yet', 'honest', 'portrayal', 'family', 'so', 'stunningly', 'dramatic', 'often', 'found', 'just', 'staring', 'TV', 'screen', 'disbelief', 'good', 'bad', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'many', 'reviewers', 'here', 'are', 'infuriated', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'Polish', 'Wedding', 'realistic', 'eight', 'year', 'old', 'soon', 'addicted', 'cigarattes', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'adultress', 'rebellious', 'daughter', 'get', 'away', 'everything.I', 'found', 'movie', 'be', 'rather', 'enjoyable', 'not', 'like', 'many', 'other', 'realistic', 'cultural', 'movies', 'where', 'actual', 'portrayal', 'certain', 'lifestyle', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'expert', 'Polish', 'culture', 'can', 'tell', 'only', 'trying', 'poke', 'fun', 'not', 'be', 'racist', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'thinking', 'was', 'how', 'Polish', 'acted', 'Then', 'again', 'message', ""'m"", 'getting', 'Polish', 'reviewers', 'here', 'Polish', 'Wedding', 'attempting', 'be', 'racist', 'going', 'top', 'could', ""n't"", 'same', 'said', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Wedding', 'merely', 'poking', 'fun', 'own', 'cultural', 'traditions']",N/A

457226,A1LACH6MLQWZ,6305265712,Doug Erlandson,"[0, 0]","""Polish Wedding"" takes place in an ethnic neighborhood in Detroit. Its characters are working class people who would probably like a better life for themselves and their children but who have no clue as to how this can come about. In it, we see the younger generation making the same mistakes as the older generation, lacking any vision for a better life, having babies out of wedlock and then getting married because it's the honorable thing to do, and not getting an education as a result.Now, a story based on this theme could be told in a compelling way, but ""Polish Wedding"" does not do this. The dialogue is trite. The characters are stereotypes. And the storyline is thin. It's advertised as being ""hilariously funny."" I would say that it's worth a few grins at most. Moreover, there's nothing distinctively Polish about it. The same story could have been set in any ethnic neighborhood without much change, other than to perhaps replace the Polish food at the wedding reception.

What was that all about?I am 2nd generation Polish American.  I did not find a lot to identify with in this movie.  I wasn't offended exactly, but I can see why people would be.  The characters are very broadly drawn with liberal use of stereotypes.  I felt like the movie was trying to make a point but not focused in what the point was.  I guess it is about the importance of family, regardless of culture.  My cold, cold heart was a tiny bit warmed by the scenes of Hala with her father.  Claire Danes and Gabriel Byrne are accomplished actors both.  Really, all of the acting is fine, but the storyline and the characters are problematic.The soundtrack is truly annoying, this tinkly fake-ethnic music.If you are making an ethnic movie, food will probably figure prominently.  I enjoyed references to pierogi and czarnina (duck blood soup, a truly vile concoction).  The pickles - my grandma's kitchen always smelled like dill.The ending didn't work for me.  It usually doesn't work if you slap up a screen that says ""One Year Later"" and tack on a scene that ties up all the ends in a neat little package.  I would have rather watched an extra 10 or 15 minutes to see how everyone got to that point over the next year, but whatever.  It's kind of an interesting movie.  I can't compare it to anything else I've seen, so that makes it unique, I guess.
