1571906,ADA56HQ6DIP4U,B008NNY9C6,Carlton D. Fisher,"[3, 5]","I don't understand why people continue to watch found footage films when they don't like them, then complain that they watched another one.  If you don't like the sub-genre, then it's unlikely you're going to find something in it that appeals to you.  It's a sub-genre built more on atmosphere, sound design, and what you don't see than it is the straight-up, in-your-face slasher or monster flick.  If that older style does not appeal to you, then you're not going to like found footage movies.That said, Greystone Park is a great example of the sub-genre of found footage horror.  The atmosphere is creepy, the actors are believable, and most importantly, the premise is solid.  A group of friends are exploring an abandoned (or is it?) asylum.  What they find there is more than what they expected.  I'd rank this in quality with Blair With and Paranormal Activity (once again, if you hate those films, then you're probably going to hate this too).",4,A great found-footage film,1360195200,"02 7, 2013",2013,951,"['do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'continue', 'watch', 'found', 'footage', 'films', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'then', 'complain', 'watched', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'sub-genre', 'then', 'unlikely', ""'re"", 'going', 'find', 'something', 'appeals', 'sub-genre', 'built', 'more', 'atmosphere', 'sound', 'design', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'straight-up', 'in-your-face', 'slasher', 'monster', 'flick', 'older', 'style', 'not', 'appeal', 'then', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'like', 'found', 'footage', 'movies.That', 'said', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'great', 'example', 'sub-genre', 'found', 'footage', 'horror', 'atmosphere', 'creepy', 'actors', 'are', 'believable', 'most', 'importantly', 'premise', 'solid', 'group', 'friends', 'are', 'exploring', 'abandoned', 'asylum', 'What', 'find', 'more', 'what', 'expected', ""'d"", 'rank', 'quality', 'Blair', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'once', 'again', 'hate', 'films', 'then', ""'re"", 'probably', 'going', 'hate', 'too']",Greystone Park 2012

1571908,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,B008NNY9C6,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[3, 5]","I can see where some people might not like this movie or look down from their pretentious heights at its lack of clarity - but boring?  Boring?  Good grief, this is one of the most creepy and atmospheric horror films I've seen in quite a while - and this ain't my first horror rodeo.  Greystone Park actually succeeds where other low-budget ""let's explore a haunted house"" films drop the ball.  There's wonderfully subtle imagery, especially early on as dark shadows or amorphous faces briefly appear in flashes and transitions that only the camera reveals.  As things progress, everything intensifies, including the sights and sounds the characters do detect.  Sometimes, you don't see or understand what they are reacting to, and that only intensifies the deliciously creepy atmosphere oozing to life on the screen.  Even the sudden frights designed to really scare the audience work well.  Perhaps the best thing about the viewing experience, though, is the fact that much is left up to the audience's imaginations.  It's not always clear what the heck is going on, and even the characters are sometimes left wondering if it's all in their minds.  More than once, I stopped and rewatched a certain sequence to make sure I saw what I thought I saw.  Maybe this aspect of the film is what turns some viewers off, having been programmed by Hollywood to think that horror movies are supposed to be incredibly obvious, paint-by-numbers constructions that require no thought whatsoever.So what goes on here?  Two college students, Sean Stone (son of Oliver Stone) and Antonella Lentini, meet Alexander Wraith at a dinner party (hosted by Oliver Stone) and decide to accompany him on one of his adventures inside the abandoned and reportedly haunted Greystone Park mental asylum.  Sean's a skeptic going to face his fears, while Antonella is basically one of those girls with a sexy dark side.  Cameras and flashlights in hand, they sneak their way into the vast building and begin exploring.  The atmosphere of the vast, dilapidated building could not be creepier, with more than a few eerie dolls scattered here and there alongside the abandoned hospital equipment just for good measure.  Even as they begin to see shadows and hear unexplained noises, Alex leads them deeper and deeper into the jungle of rooms and hallways.  By the time the more serious stuff starts to go down, finding their way back out of the place is problematic, to say the least.  An ambiguous ending isn't really the ultimate payoff I was expecting, but it certainly takes nothing away from all of the wonderful creepiness that preceded it.Let's talk about the ""inspired by true events"" label.  It's only real in the sense that the filmmakers decided to make their haunted asylum movie by picking up cameras and shooting the film in an actual haunted asylum - which is something they had already been doing on their own.  That includes breaking in to Greystone and some other haunted locations on multiple occasions.  Obviously, some CGI effects were added later, but I think the film locations could have held their own quite well without any additions.  The filmmakers definitely bought in to the reputation of the place.  From what I've read, the commentary features several reports of strange things - even brief possessions - experienced by the crew during filming as well as some unwelcome visitors back at their own homes.I'm totally at a loss as to the overwhelmingly negative reaction to this film, as this horror veteran was very impressed.  I actually think Greystone Park breathes vibrant new life into the ""found footage"" genre (I don't think this film technically belongs in that category, but I know that is how it will be classified).  Some viewers complain that they couldn't tell where the characters were at times.  Really?  What part of ""getting lost in the labyrinthine depths of a haunted insane asylum"" don't you understand?  If the characters knew where they were, they would have gotten the heck out of that place.  Getting lost is the whole point.  Come on, people.  Those who complain the movie was literally too dark to see what was happening need to turn the fricking lights off - that's the way you're supposed to watch horror movies to begin with.",5,Ultra-creepy and suspenseful,1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,4251,"['can', 'see', 'where', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'like', 'movie', 'look', 'down', 'pretentious', 'heights', 'lack', 'clarity', 'boring', 'Boring', 'Good', 'grief', 'one', 'most', 'creepy', 'atmospheric', 'horror', 'films', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'quite', 'while', 'ai', ""n't"", 'first', 'horror', 'rodeo', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'actually', 'where', 'other', 'low-budget', 'let', 'explore', 'haunted', 'house', 'films', 'drop', 'ball', 'wonderfully', 'subtle', 'imagery', 'especially', 'early', 'dark', 'shadows', 'amorphous', 'briefly', 'appear', 'flashes', 'transitions', 'only', 'camera', 'things', 'progress', 'everything', 'intensifies', 'including', 'sights', 'characters', 'do', 'detect', 'Sometimes', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'understand', 'what', 'are', 'reacting', 'only', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'atmosphere', 'oozing', 'life', 'screen', 'Even', 'sudden', 'frights', 'designed', 'really', 'scare', 'audience', 'work', 'well', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'thing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'fact', 'much', 'left', 'up', 'audience', 'imaginations', 'not', 'always', 'clear', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'sometimes', 'left', 'wondering', 'minds', 'More', 'once', 'stopped', 'rewatched', 'certain', 'sequence', 'make', 'sure', 'saw', 'what', 'thought', 'saw', 'Maybe', 'aspect', 'film', 'what', 'viewers', 'off', 'having', 'been', 'programmed', 'Hollywood', 'think', 'horror', 'movies', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'incredibly', 'obvious', 'paint-by-numbers', 'constructions', 'require', 'thought', 'what', 'here', 'Two', 'college', 'students', 'Sean', 'Stone', 'son', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Antonella', 'Lentini', 'meet', 'Alexander', 'Wraith', 'dinner', 'party', 'hosted', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'decide', 'accompany', 'one', 'adventures', 'abandoned', 'reportedly', 'haunted', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'mental', 'asylum', 'Sean', 'skeptic', 'going', 'face', 'fears', 'Antonella', 'basically', 'one', 'girls', 'sexy', 'dark', 'side', 'Cameras', 'flashlights', 'hand', 'sneak', 'way', 'vast', 'building', 'begin', 'exploring', 'atmosphere', 'vast', 'dilapidated', 'building', 'could', 'not', 'be', 'creepier', 'more', 'few', 'eerie', 'dolls', 'scattered', 'here', 'there', 'alongside', 'abandoned', 'hospital', 'equipment', 'just', 'good', 'measure', 'Even', 'begin', 'see', 'shadows', 'hear', 'unexplained', 'noises', 'Alex', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'jungle', 'rooms', 'hallways', 'time', 'more', 'serious', 'stuff', 'go', 'down', 'finding', 'way', 'back', 'place', 'problematic', 'say', 'least', 'ambiguous', 'ending', ""n't"", 'really', 'ultimate', 'payoff', 'was', 'expecting', 'certainly', 'nothing', 'away', 'wonderful', 'creepiness', 'preceded', 'it.Let', 'talk', 'inspired', 'true', 'events', 'label', 'only', 'real', 'sense', 'filmmakers', 'decided', 'make', 'haunted', 'asylum', 'movie', 'picking', 'up', 'cameras', 'shooting', 'film', 'actual', 'haunted', 'asylum', 'something', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'doing', 'own', 'breaking', 'Greystone', 'other', 'haunted', 'locations', 'multiple', 'occasions', 'Obviously', 'CGI', 'effects', 'were', 'added', 'later', 'think', 'film', 'locations', 'could', 'have', 'held', 'own', 'quite', 'well', 'additions', 'filmmakers', 'definitely', 'bought', 'reputation', 'place', 'what', ""'ve"", 'read', 'commentary', 'features', 'several', 'reports', 'strange', 'things', 'even', 'brief', 'possessions', 'experienced', 'crew', 'filming', 'as', 'well', 'unwelcome', 'visitors', 'back', 'own', 'homes.I', ""'m"", 'totally', 'loss', 'overwhelmingly', 'negative', 'reaction', 'film', 'horror', 'veteran', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'actually', 'think', 'Greystone', 'Park', 'breathes', 'vibrant', 'new', 'life', 'found', 'footage', 'genre', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'technically', 'category', 'know', 'how', 'will', 'be', 'classified', 'viewers', 'complain', 'could', ""n't"", 'tell', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'times', 'Really', 'What', 'part', 'getting', 'lost', 'labyrinthine', 'depths', 'haunted', 'insane', 'asylum', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'characters', 'knew', 'where', 'were', 'would', 'have', 'gotten', 'heck', 'place', 'Getting', 'lost', 'whole', 'point', 'Come', 'people', 'who', 'complain', 'movie', 'was', 'literally', 'too', 'dark', 'see', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'need', 'turn', 'fricking', 'lights', 'way', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'watch', 'horror', 'movies', 'begin']",Greystone Park 2012
1571909,A4MF6S6TSGS8T,B008NNY9C6,F. Gwin,"[11, 14]","I love bad horror movies, so even if this movie was bad I would have at least enjoyed it. But it's not bad. It's just downright awful! I usually like to divide up the positives and then the negatives at this part of the review, but there really are no positives to speak of. So here are the negatives:The camera work is awful. I'm not just talking about the shaky camera, which certainly is annoying, I'm talking about the logic behind the cameras. I understand that some people just love the idea of found footage movies, and that is fine, but this movie is just pretending to be a found footage movie. There are LOTS of camera shots that are not from an in-movie camera. Take the first scene for example: our protagonists are sitting around a table and the camera switches around randomly, all while there is a main camera that one of the protagonists is filming from. Later, while the three protagonists are sneaking into the asylum, they walk through a graveyard. While in this graveyard the two that are not holding the camera get into an argument, and rather than filming them both from a distance the cameraman flawlessly cuts from face to face WHILE THEY ARE STILL TALKING. It's not a found footage movie unless the camera shots are all continuous! You can't just do that!The lighting is also terrible. Apparently someone decided to hook up a generator to the burnt down building (why?) and rather than hook it up well, these unnamed individuals decided to make all the lights flashy and scary. Did the mechanics not know what they were doing? This makes the film into a little seizure-fest. I'm not kidding when I say that I had to look away from the screen at some parts. It is just AWFUL.The characters, played by themselves, are also incredibly bland. The pacing is also so boring that after about twenty minutes I had to pause the movie and go make a cup of coffee so that I would not fall asleep (no, I am not joking). Ten minutes after I got coffee I turned the clock in my room around so that I wouldn't have to watch the minutes pass anymore. I really wanted the characters to die horrible deaths just so that something interesting would happen. Somewhere in the movie some other random characters show up and die almost instantly. Why? Because the writers needed unlikable characters to kill off and didn't want to kill off any of the main unlikable characters. They were literally forced into the plot just to kill off. There is also a dumb ending with a jump scare.The locations were specifically picked to be real rundown hospitals. But, as is made clear throughout the movie, MANY locations were used. I could honestly never tell where the actors were in this movie. The shots are generally of a random, rundown hallway or room, then the film cuts to another shot of the protagonists exploring another unconnected hallway or room. This kills any sort of mood or atmosphere that this movie could have had. Whenever something is chasing them the camera just cuts to the scene when the chase is over and they are all catching their breath (rather than have a scary moment where the cameraman is being chased but doesn't know how close it is, which might actually be good).Actually, as I think about it, there were two really funny things about this movie:Near the beginning of the movie, for no reason the cameraman finds his love interest in the library and she says to him (and I am not kidding), ""Sean, you can't film in the library, you'll get us kicked out."" I almost died laughing.During the special features of the movie we find out that all of the cast members believe in ghosts (including the producers, because someone had to fund this movie, and there is no way that someone who doesn't believe in ghosts would invest in such a train wreck). But they don't believe in any sort of objective base for these ghosts, just a subjective ""I think I felt a ghost"" sort of way. So if you are humored by such people telling their ghost experiences then you will have a blast watching ""the making of Greystone Park."" One protagonist apparently ran off the set in the middle of shooting and woke up in the woods outside. It must have been ghosts! It is just implausible to say that it was him trying to make everyone believe it was ghosts! Another protagonist believes that he brought home a ghost from one of the sets and it lived in his room for several months! Unbelievable! Also, while they were filming in a random hallway, someone turned on the overhead lights! But wait! None of the cast members knew where the light switch was! It surely was a ghost!!!This whole movie is a catastrophe. Like I said before, I LOVE bad horror movies. But this movie isn't bad. It's literally a sin against horror movies.

The first three chapters of the film is talking about ghosts over the family water pipe, along with a history of mental institution torture with the same lame historical black and white film plus a little Greek Mythology.Chapter 4 (in case you want to skip all that stuff and miss the mild character build up) starts the meat of the film as our threesome enter Greystone and start filming in a most annoying fashion. U-tube videos of people making love in a small row boat during a storm while tossing their camera into the air does not have as much jerking motion as this filming. When you add the fact of the lights flashing on and off, it is a wonder that you can make it through it without developing some weird epileptic motion sickness.Sean ""Shaky"" Stone is the main character. He is accompanied by Antonella Lentini and  Alexander ""Shakes"" Wraith.  The film is a clever descent into madness either through the power of suggestion of something supernatural. Unfortunately they chose a genre that ruined any script genius. Lights going out. People screaming. Shadows, quick movements. These cheap effects have all been done before and better.Parental Guidance: F-bombs, no sex or nudity.",2,SHADOW MEN,1351382400,"10 28, 2012",2012,1305,"['film', 'teens', 'explore', 'abandoned', 'mental', 'institution', 'coupled', 'hand', 'held', 'found', 'footage', 'genre', 'first', 'three', 'chapters', 'film', 'talking', 'ghosts', 'family', 'water', 'pipe', 'history', 'mental', 'institution', 'torture', 'same', 'lame', 'historical', 'black', 'white', 'film', 'little', 'Greek', 'Mythology.Chapter', '4', 'case', 'want', 'skip', 'stuff', 'miss', 'mild', 'character', 'build', 'up', 'meat', 'film', 'threesome', 'enter', 'Greystone', 'start', 'filming', 'most', 'annoying', 'fashion', 'U-tube', 'videos', 'people', 'making', 'love', 'small', 'row', 'boat', 'storm', 'tossing', 'camera', 'air', 'not', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'jerking', 'motion', 'filming', 'When', 'add', 'fact', 'lights', 'flashing', 'wonder', 'can', 'make', 'developing', 'weird', 'epileptic', 'motion', 'sickness.Sean', 'Shaky', 'Stone', 'main', 'character', 'accompanied', 'Antonella', 'Lentini', 'Alexander', 'Shakes', 'Wraith', 'film', 'clever', 'descent', 'madness', 'power', 'suggestion', 'something', 'supernatural', 'Unfortunately', 'chose', 'genre', 'ruined', 'script', 'genius', 'Lights', 'going', 'out', 'People', 'screaming', 'Shadows', 'quick', 'movements', 'cheap', 'effects', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better.Parental', 'Guidance', 'F-bombs', 'sex', 'nudity']",Greystone Park 2012
