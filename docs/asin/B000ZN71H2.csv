Nancy (14), Dominic, and Rose are the focal points for a moving story about children from Northern Uganda's Patongo Primary School working hard to use their tribal identity to catapult them to a national contest of native music and dance.This aspect would be of enough interest in itself, but the ordeal each child has had to face is heartbreaking.  Without giving away each one's testimony, they have had to come to terms with a civil war that mars them socially and emotionally.  In their Northern region the government's military is on guard against a rebel resistance that uses horrible tactics.  Many children are abducted (30,000 Acholi tribe children) , so they can train them militarily, and others are cruelly orphaned (200,000 approx.).  When the children tell us their own difficulties, they sometimes break into tears.  As Nancy says, ""It's difficult for people to believe our story.""  Rose is overworked.  She is lead by her aunt who delegates all her tasks to clean the hut, bathe the children, and cook the food.  What a difficult burden!It's easy to be harsh on the adults, for they seem so harsh with the children.  I kept thinking, 'Why don't these people lighten up on these kids?'  Yet, as strict as they are, they do care.  Patongo's jolly Okot is their music teacher, and he doesn't let up on the children one iota.  He tells Dominic, a virtuoso xylophone player, that everything depends on him.  June Adong, a music instructor, expects nothing less than perfection, yet she shares that ""Music is the big therapy in children's lives.""  In a gut-wrenching scene, Nancy's mother has her visit her father's grave where Nancy's grief is shown to be excruciating.  The mother calms her down, but partly scolds her that she may be drawing the rebels' attention with her loud sobs.  Rough indeed.Absorbed in their troubles, the film switches focus to the contest. As the proud first-year entrants from their school, they face formidable competition from their Southern counterparts who have had less difficulty and more money.  It isn't hard to root for our team when the Southerners are calling the Patongo children rebel murderers.Besides tightly edited anecdotes, the film is marvelous for the music.  The contest draws us into a vibrant pageant of rhythms, beautiful singing, and gorgeously bright native attire.  The dancing and synchronized movements are a testimony to artistic achievement as well as a resilient human spirit.As a very worthy Oscar nominee for Best Documentary, 'War/Dance' is a luminous and illuminating look at the perseverance of people in conditions and situations that are easy to forget.

Although it lost out toTaxi To the Dark Side, War Dance need not hang its head.Little known subjects are a great thing to learn about, and this is War Dance's biggest strength. The civil war in Uganda has raged for over 20 years, but few know what it's about or its effects on the population. One look at War Dance will give you some chilling insights.Focusing on three children within the Patongo refugee camp of northern Uganda, all of the kids have lost at least one parent, sibling or family member to the horrors of the war, and have been forced into this government protected camp for basic survival. Life is dank, depressing, and full of fear. Until one day the children discover that their little school has qualified for the finals at the annual Kampala Music Festival. And with them will go Dominic, a boy forced into being a child soldier for the rebels and desperately trying to locate his lost brother. A gripping scene between himself and a rebel leader tells Dominic much of what he already suspected. Nancy, a tough young lady, will go the Kampala, too. And with her she brings the hopes and dreams of her father who was hacked to death by machetes (the visit to his grave is sure to have many reaching for the tissue box). Then we have Rose, the soft-spoken one who is obviously in a funk of depression. But to watch her dance is to see the lights burst forth from her eyes.The documentary is exceptionally well put together. The cinematography of the surrounding jungle is awe-inspiring, as are the tough scenes where children are put in front of the camera and asked to explain how they feel (""I can't wait to see what peace looks like,"" says one of them as they prepare to compete in Kampala).Shown as a sort of David and Goliath tale, one can't help but see the infiltration of Christianity on these people's lives, too. Their clothing, their ""prayers"", and many other aspects speak to the westernization of their culture. One of the competition categories is even called ""Western Choral Music."" But the big winner in the categories is obviously the native dance sequence where Dominic shines as the xylophone player, Nancy dances and spins with delight, and Rose comes back to life. The other schools, initially sneering at this ""tiny school from the north"", begin to respect them.But can these first timers win anything at a festival where they compete against schools of much greater renown? You'll have to watch and find out. And you should. The tales of torture mixed with the joy of music and dance are something everyone should see. And you might even learn something you didn't know about in another part of the world.",5,Watch. Listen.

I had no idea. No idea. And I am grateful to these children for sharing their story, a story of children being stolen from their parents to build a rebel army. Children systematically dehumanized, led to murder without remorse with a band of rebels that teaches death instead of reading writing and rithmetic. This is not an unknown phenomenon. It is not exclusive to Africa and not exclusive to modern times. I was reminded of the Khmer Rouge and the killing fields of Cambodia. And yet. And yet. Some government soldiers offering security, United Nations trucks providing food deliveries, and a school for orphaned children provides some protection for a little flame of hope in the midst of the most dire circumstances imaginable. To see these kids progress along a path of healing and reconciliation through singing, dancing, and music making is a thing of beauty, all the more starkly contrasted with the circumstances of their rescue. It demonstrates the importance of culture, or music, of art, of self expression, as a part of the natural health of the human mind and spirit, and it shows the possibility of transformative redemption in the face of a brutal, predatory reality. The story of these children would be beautiful in it's own right, but to see it in the context of their suffering and deprivation heightens the ironic sense of appreciation for all their accomplishments.

One track is the horrific stories of violence and terror as told by the children themselves (the PG-13 rating) about being forced to watch their parents and siblings being killed and picking up the body parts after, about being forced at gunpoint to kill others with a hoe and other unspeakable experiences. The other track takes you down a path of hope and optimism as you follow the preparation of Patongo Grammar School (the school in the camp) to participate in the prestigious national music and dance festival in Kampala. One very talented young student is determined to be the 'best xylophone player in Uganda'. This is the first time this school has been selected to represent their tribe at the competition. They bring in two professional teachers to help. The students are excited and confident and nervous-for many (if not most) their first trip to a real city. With the camp under 24/7 armed military guard, there is little opportunity to venture more than a few yards outside the camp perimeter. Finally, the big day arrives and the village sends them off in trucks with armed guards. Even in Uganda there is the 'wrong side of the tracks' and the students discover that the other students at the festival consider them to be from that side. This makes them even more determined to win. The competition is an exciting finish to this both horrific and heartwarming film.

They had rich potential material and I felt that they covered it only rather superficially.Their main point was believable -- these kids have been through hell and a musical competition in the capital was extremely important for their morale and self-esteem. I thought that was a wonderful point to make. It will stick in my mind.But they used a lot of film to say this. There were endless shots of cute kids just looking pitiful. At some point it even seemed somewhat manipulative. We did hear about the terrible things that the kids had experienced and yet I never felt that we got very far beyond this in terms of their individuality considering how much film was used.We heard snippets of the music and yet there was very little feeling for what a complete traditional song was and how it fit into tribal identity. Again, the focus was so much on the competition that the relationship between the music and the inner person was not well developed, whereas there was certainly time to do it.I wanted to know more about the competition. Who set it up? Why in artistic terms did these kids score so well? Could they have scored so well without the teachers that had been sent to them? How much of their music was authentically traditional stuff that they already knew and how much was shaped by the teachers? I would say edit out some of the repetitious shots of the faces of cute kids and give more information about what was going on. I am not saying that there was none!! Just dig a bit more.I don't want to seem overly critical, but I am the 28th reviewer and all the other reviews are five stars and I think I should try to explain why I cannot rave about this. I do think that if this film comes around on Link TV the average viewer might find it interesting and more worth watching than most of what is on TV. There is too little on the tragedies in Africa as they affect individuals and children in particular. But aside from the importance of keeping the tragedies in mind, for me this was only an average ""alternative"" channel TV documentary in terms of quality.",3,Just satisfactory,1224547200,"10 21, 2008",2008,2145,"['was', 'glad', 'watch', 'once', 'certainly', 'not', 'keeper', 'had', 'rich', 'potential', 'material', 'felt', 'covered', 'only', 'rather', 'superficially.Their', 'main', 'point', 'was', 'believable', 'kids', 'have', 'been', 'hell', 'musical', 'competition', 'capital', 'was', 'extremely', 'important', 'morale', 'self-esteem', 'thought', 'was', 'wonderful', 'point', 'make', 'will', 'stick', 'mind.But', 'used', 'lot', 'film', 'say', 'were', 'endless', 'shots', 'cute', 'kids', 'just', 'looking', 'pitiful', 'point', 'even', 'seemed', 'somewhat', 'manipulative', 'did', 'hear', 'terrible', 'things', 'kids', 'had', 'experienced', 'yet', 'never', 'felt', 'got', 'very', 'far', 'terms', 'individuality', 'considering', 'how', 'much', 'film', 'was', 'used.We', 'heard', 'snippets', 'music', 'yet', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'feeling', 'what', 'complete', 'traditional', 'song', 'was', 'how', 'fit', 'tribal', 'identity', 'Again', 'focus', 'was', 'so', 'much', 'competition', 'relationship', 'music', 'inner', 'person', 'was', 'not', 'well', 'developed', 'was', 'certainly', 'time', 'do', 'it.I', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'competition', 'Who', 'set', 'up', 'Why', 'artistic', 'terms', 'did', 'kids', 'score', 'so', 'well', 'Could', 'have', 'scored', 'so', 'well', 'teachers', 'had', 'been', 'sent', 'How', 'much', 'music', 'was', 'authentically', 'traditional', 'stuff', 'already', 'knew', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'shaped', 'teachers', 'would', 'say', 'edit', 'repetitious', 'shots', 'cute', 'kids', 'give', 'more', 'information', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'was', 'none', 'Just', 'dig', 'bit', 'more.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'seem', 'overly', 'critical', 'am', '28th', 'reviewer', 'other', 'reviews', 'are', 'five', 'stars', 'think', 'should', 'try', 'explain', 'why', 'can', 'not', 'rave', 'do', 'think', 'film', 'around', 'Link', 'TV', 'average', 'viewer', 'might', 'find', 'interesting', 'more', 'worth', 'watching', 'most', 'what', 'TV', 'too', 'little', 'tragedies', 'Africa', 'affect', 'individuals', 'children', 'particular', 'aside', 'importance', 'keeping', 'tragedies', 'mind', 'was', 'only', 'average', 'alternative', 'channel', 'TV', 'documentary', 'terms', 'quality']",N/A

Zwick,"[2, 3]","In the war-ravaged region of northern Uganda, a group of Acholi children - many of them orphans - living in a government-run refugee camp, use music and dance as a means to keep hope alive.  Indeed, the youngsters are so good at what they do that their school was chosen as a finalist in the 2005 Kampala Music Festival, an event held annually in the nation`s capital.  Of course, before they can participate in that event, the kids and their instructors will have to safely navigate their way through the rebel-infested region that lies between their camp and their intended destination.The Oscar-nominated documentary ""War Dance,"" directed by Sean and Andrea Nix Fine, tells the story of these children.In the camp, music has become a form of therapy for these traumatized youngsters, a means to help them come to terms with - or at least temporarily forget - the unspeakable atrocities they've experienced in their short lives, atrocities they recount for us in graphic and harrowing detail.  In its ""lighter"" moments, the movie focuses on the children as they rehearse for the upcoming competition.  Then it's on to the festival itself, where the children of Patongo sing, dance and perform their little hearts out, filled with suspense at the outcome, anticipation of taking home a prize, and pride in a job well done.  And the sheer, unadulterated joy is palpable.As a study in contrasts, the movie presents us with both the best and the worst that humanity has to offer - the heartbreaking along with the heartwarming.  And indeed, you would need to have a heart of stone not to be deeply touched by this film.",4,humanity at its worst and at its best,1294444800,"01 8, 2011",2011,1617,"['war-ravaged', 'region', 'northern', 'Uganda', 'group', 'Acholi', 'children', 'many', 'living', 'government-run', 'refugee', 'camp', 'use', 'music', 'dance', 'means', 'keep', 'hope', 'alive', 'Indeed', 'youngsters', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'what', 'do', 'school', 'was', 'chosen', 'finalist', '2005', 'Kampala', 'Music', 'Festival', 'event', 'held', 'annually', 'nation', 's', 'capital', 'course', 'can', 'participate', 'event', 'kids', 'instructors', 'will', 'have', 'safely', 'navigate', 'way', 'rebel-infested', 'region', 'camp', 'intended', 'destination.The', 'Oscar-nominated', 'documentary', 'War', 'Dance', 'directed', 'Sean', 'Andrea', 'Nix', 'Fine', 'story', 'children.In', 'camp', 'music', 'become', 'form', 'therapy', 'traumatized', 'youngsters', 'means', 'help', 'come', 'terms', 'least', 'temporarily', 'forget', 'unspeakable', 'atrocities', ""'ve"", 'experienced', 'short', 'lives', 'atrocities', 'recount', 'graphic', 'harrowing', 'detail', 'lighter', 'moments', 'movie', 'children', 'rehearse', 'upcoming', 'competition', 'Then', 'festival', 'where', 'children', 'Patongo', 'sing', 'dance', 'perform', 'little', 'hearts', 'out', 'filled', 'suspense', 'outcome', 'anticipation', 'taking', 'home', 'prize', 'pride', 'job', 'well', 'done', 'sheer', 'unadulterated', 'joy', 'study', 'contrasts', 'movie', 'best', 'worst', 'humanity', 'offer', 'heartbreaking', 'heartwarming', 'indeed', 'would', 'need', 'have', 'heart', 'stone', 'not', 'be', 'deeply', 'touched', 'film']",N/A

McGee,"[1, 1]","""We are going to show them that we are giants,"" declares 14-year-old Dominic, as he prepares to go on stage at Kampala's national theater to compete in Uganda's massive school musical performance competition. Almost miraculously, it seems, Dominic's school in one of the remotest and most war-torn areas of northern Uganda, has made it through the preliminary rounds and will represent their region and the beleagured Acholi tribe at the annual event.That's no mean feat, since Dominic and his fellow musicians live in a camp for internal refugees in Patongo, crowded together in huts, guarded around the clock by the army and reliant on monthly food distributions from relief organizations. Each of the three young teenagers has undergone tremendous trauma -- one tells a harrowing story of her parents' fate -- but when they perform, the sadness disappears from their faces to be be replaced by the sheer joy of performing.It's rare for a documentary film to triumph on so many fronts. The cinematography is superb; the editing is seamless, the soundtrack (not surprisingly, given the topic) will have your toes tapping and body moving in no time. The viewer sees daily life in the refugee village and the final rehearsals for the performance from the point of view of the three young teens whose stories serve as the focal point of the documentary and it's told largely through their eyes, with only a few comments from outsiders, from a judge in Kampala to the Acholi tribe professional musicians who arrive at the 11th hour to help the Patongo school prepare for the competition.The film is a journey on many levels. As the young people discuss their lives to date, they reach certain crisis points -- Dominic, for instance, discussses his experiences as a child soldier and obtains some news on the probable fate of his older brother, while Rose finds the courage to defy her aunt, who treats her as an unpaid servant, to make the trip to Kampala. It's a journey of discovery for all the young musicians when they leave for Kampala, glued to the windows of the bus as they watch their country whirl past them and as they arrive in the big city. They discover not only the wonders of the city itself, but the dismissive attitudes of other, more privileged and wealthier schools who are competing. ""I pray I will not let my people down,"" Dominic mutters to himself before stepping on stage with his traditional xylophone. But they discover that what matters is the joy of music.An endnote reminds us that for all the film's uplifting nature, all three of its main characters remained in overcrowded and poor Patongo, under siege by rebels, some two or three years later. But this is far more than a film designed to remind us of how fortunate we are; it serves also to remind us of the common elements of our human existence and the transformative powers of music and dance.
