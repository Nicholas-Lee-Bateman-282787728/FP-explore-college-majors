It's a very instructional DVD and you can customize it any way you would like to. It even has a workout type for women & men! It's a great addition to my other workouts!!

They added the other trainer in and for me.... her voice is a little annoying.  She does not keep her count as well and seems to mess up a bit.  However, she does work you!  I enjoy doing the Functional Flexibilty, Boot Camp, & The Men's Cardio Max.  The Men's Cardio (I am a woman) made me feel as though my legs were going to explode and they felt great afterwards. I felt as though I had the beautiful runners legs that I have always wanted.  ;)~ I definitely recommend owning  a Workout Ball. They use it several times in the video.  They also use a medicine ball but my ball works just as well since it has sand inside so that it does not roll.  Hand weights are important too.  You set the workout for as long as you need by choosing the workouts from a menu with it keeping track of the time for you.  I recommend this video.

I love Bob (have his solo workouts not BL related), but in the BL workouts he seems more unorganized. It's like he slapped together the moves.

You can choose your own personal workout by choosing from the various segments here.  Each segment is around 10 to 15 minutes and they all do different things like fat burning, flexibility and toning various muscle groups.  Even better, if you are a woman there are segments that focus a lot on abs and thighs.  Bob and Kim are enthusiastic and help you along, and it's nice to see real people (former contestants) perform the routines (instead of the always stick thin exercisers).All you need to get started is a fair bit of room, weights, a stability ball and you can opt to use a medicine ball if you have one.  Overall, it's a great workout that is made better by the customisation which I love.  I really like it and have found already in the while since I've gotten this, that I'm feeling good.
