It is repetitive in that they go over th numbers a lot of times and it sticks with you.  The characters are all cute, but the only thing I don't get is Max, the monkey.  Why did they think it was necessary to have this monkey (who hardly looks like a monkey in my opinion) with an English accent I am not sure.  Are they trying to tech 2-year olds that people have different accents and come from different countries, if so, I think it is a little too early and maybe somewhat confusing to the child.  Nevertheless. this is a minor remark that I have but I love the DVD format and songs and my daughter likes it too.",5,Great DVD and learning tool,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,666,"['great', 'DVD', 'teach', 'child', 'numbers', 'repetitive', 'go', 'th', 'numbers', 'lot', 'times', 'characters', 'are', 'cute', 'only', 'thing', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'Max', 'monkey', 'Why', 'did', 'think', 'was', 'necessary', 'have', 'monkey', 'who', 'hardly', 'monkey', 'opinion', 'English', 'accent', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'Are', 'trying', 'tech', '2-year', 'olds', 'people', 'have', 'different', 'accents', 'come', 'different', 'countries', 'so', 'think', 'little', 'too', 'early', 'maybe', 'somewhat', 'confusing', 'child', 'Nevertheless', 'minor', 'remark', 'have', 'love', 'DVD', 'format', 'songs', 'daughter', 'too']",Leapfrog: Numberland

We only let her watch shows for children her age, that are educational, and she really likes. Leapfrog has a very good series of fun learning videos that can be seen on t.v. or your own DVD's. These are excellent, she is just 2 and she's learning numbers, shapes,the alphabet and she loves Scout the dog and his friends, for some reason right now she likes the puppies and kitties, not the frogs. She knows the characters well and she likes the songs, which also are greatt eachers. . An all around excellent fun learning experience and not annoying to parents. Highly recommend 2-4 yrs.

""Numberland"" is a DVD that features the fun characters from Leapfrog products, but also numbers 1-10.  It is a perfect first counting DVD for kids to learn from and it fits nicely with the other Leapfrog products.  Throughout the DVD the numbers 1-10 are repeated and re-arranged over and over, but not in a boring way.  The DVD makes kids think too because it puts the numbers in different orders, has them answer which number is missing and so forth.  The animation is bright, colorful and kid-friendly.  While this DVD is only 35 minutes, my boys don't mind watching it over and over again!  The DVD states its for 2-6 year olds, and my boys are 3 and 5 and love it.",4,Cute for Kids 2-6,1329868800,"02 22, 2012",2012,799,"['boys', 'love', 'Leapfrog', 'products', 'few', 'letter', 'DVDs', 'have', 'seen', 'Leapfrog', 'figured', 'DVD', 'would', 'be', 'hit', 'as', 'well', 'Numberland', 'DVD', 'fun', 'characters', 'Leapfrog', 'products', 'also', 'numbers', '1-10', 'perfect', 'first', 'counting', 'DVD', 'kids', 'learn', 'nicely', 'other', 'Leapfrog', 'products', 'DVD', 'numbers', '1-10', 'are', 'repeated', 're-arranged', 'not', 'boring', 'way', 'DVD', 'kids', 'think', 'too', 'numbers', 'different', 'orders', 'answer', 'number', 'missing', 'so', 'forth', 'animation', 'bright', 'colorful', 'kid-friendly', 'DVD', 'only', '35', 'minutes', 'boys', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'watching', 'over', 'again', 'DVD', '2-6', 'year', 'olds', 'boys', 'are', '3', '5', 'love']",Leapfrog: Numberland
