Even if it makes it into your mouth you spit it out? Then after a time and you grow a little, vegitables aren't the big nasty monster's that your dad used to shove in your face? Well, that's the best way to describe this film from my point of view. I flipped through the channel's, stopped on the opening titles and kept on flipping. A second passed and I decided to flip back and give it a chance. What a rewarding decision that was. Julie Kavner won a place in my imagination with her portrayal of a nurse in Awakening's, my favorite film. She also does the voice of Marge Simpson. You get to see a performance that comes from the simpson side of her talent's as she plays a comedian and mother of two girls: Samantha Mathis, and Gabby Hoffman.(Both of these girls have since grown into blossoming careers) What I most enjoyed was the sincerity, and honesty as the girls deal with the same problems as their mother. Each trying to discover the secrets of life and love. Their mother is trying to stay on the road as a hit comedian and at the same time be a loving mom, while the girls are dealing with the effect's of their mother's action's and her spotty dress. A lot of light hearted moment's and a really enjoyable movie.",4,Seeing Spots,1004313600,"10 29, 2001",2001,1349,"['know', 'when', 'are', 'real', 'little', ""parent't"", 'want', 'shove', 'vegitable', 'mouth', 'instantly', 'reject', 'Even', 'mouth', 'spit', 'out', 'Then', 'time', 'grow', 'little', 'vegitables', 'are', ""n't"", 'big', 'nasty', 'monster', 'dad', 'used', 'shove', 'face', 'Well', 'best', 'way', 'describe', 'film', 'point', 'view', 'flipped', 'channel', 'stopped', 'opening', 'titles', 'kept', 'flipping', 'second', 'passed', 'decided', 'flip', 'back', 'give', 'chance', 'What', 'rewarding', 'decision', 'was', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'won', 'place', 'imagination', 'portrayal', 'nurse', 'Awakening', 'favorite', 'film', 'also', 'voice', 'Marge', 'Simpson', 'get', 'see', 'performance', 'simpson', 'side', 'talent', 'comedian', 'mother', 'two', 'girls', 'Samantha', 'Mathis', 'Gabby', 'Hoffman', 'girls', 'have', 'grown', 'blossoming', 'careers', 'What', 'most', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'sincerity', 'honesty', 'girls', 'deal', 'same', 'problems', 'mother', 'trying', 'discover', 'secrets', 'life', 'love', 'mother', 'trying', 'stay', 'road', 'hit', 'comedian', 'same', 'time', 'be', 'loving', 'mom', 'girls', 'are', 'dealing', 'effect', 'mother', 'action', 'spotty', 'dress', 'lot', 'light', 'hearted', 'moment', 'really', 'enjoyable', 'movie']",N/A

Thankful ""RolyPolyBear""","[0, 0]","For those of you who don't like people using the Lord's name in vain, please be advised, this film does it over and over---adults as well as children.  Also, there is a very awkward sex scene that might bother you if you just wanted to watch a movie about mom's and daughters without sex scenes.  I only say these things to warn those who might be tempted to watch but not know what they were in for.  I liked the beginning, but my favorite character didn't stay in the movie long---I wish they had---that in itself could have been a better plot.  Carrie Fisher's role was shallow and unnecessary... I am glad Nora Ephron got better over time...You have to start somewhere, and this certainly was it.  Julie Kavner did a great job as the mom---especially in the scenes where she is defending her right to have some happiness.  It was like Mermaids in the fact of the sullen, older daughter and the cute loveable younger daughter and the older daughter looking for love in the wrong places while Mom is not available for advice/love/hugs etc....  Not something I'd watch again.

312465,AE5WHX986C0KV,6302430747,miceatwork,"[0, 0]","""This is My Life"" is a delightful coming of age/coming into your own as a person story about a teenage girl whose single-parent mother upends the family's life when she embarks on her lifelong dream of becoming a stand-up comedian.  Samantha Mathis and Julie Kavner deliver outstanding performances as the daughter and her mother.  The supporting cast shines with stellar turns from Carrie Fisher (the neurotic agent), Dan Akroyd (""The Moss""), Gaby Hoffman (the little sister, ""Opal""), and Kathy Najimy and Marita Geraghty (actor friends who babysit the kids while the mother is away on gigs).  There is even a  brief, hilarious appearance of Joy Behar as a cosmetic saleswoman.  Based on Meg Wolitzer's book, Nora Ephron's screenplay is believable, touching, and funny.  The soundtrack from Carly Simon is superb.  I loved the parallell tracks of the daughter's growing up and the mother finding and forging her own identity as an adult.

312466,A2X25C107CSLOR,6302430747,"Peter Shelley ""petershelley""","[5, 9]","Nora Ephron's first effort as director (made before Sleepless in Seattle) stars Julie Kavner as a stand-up comedian. You would think that this would work considering how funny Kavner has been in The Tracey Ullman Show,  the  Woody Allen movies, and as the voice of Marge Simpson. But although she has  some clever line readings and works to make the routines come alive, she  fails since the material is not funny. This is made worse by Ephron's cuts  to the audience laughing in hysteria. Kavner also isn't believable as a  mother. She's more the big sister type,  and I think miscast, playing a  character who needs to be sympathetic for us to accept her following her  ambition at the cost of the responsibilities of her family.  Ephron does  better with Kavner's two daughters,  Samantha Morris and Gaby Hoffman, who  both give wonderful performances. Morris in particular is a revelation as  the sensitive teenager in angst, embarassed by her mother. Ephron's best  work is in the way she presents Morris' schoolyard romance, treading a  delicate line between comedy and pathos. Morris also gets one of the best  lines. When fans approach her mother at an airport, she asks &quot;Do you  like people coming up to you and not even knocking?&quot;. The film is  actually peppered with witty dialogue, and a polka dot design is fun. But  the score by Carly Simon is a major minus featuring irritatingly bland  songs performed by herself. Watch out for Barbara Stewart in a small role -  she plays an airhead with a Southern charm that is sweet and funny.",2,Slight,960940800,"06 14, 2000",2000,1556,"['Nora', 'Ephron', 'first', 'effort', 'director', 'made', 'Sleepless', 'Seattle', 'Julie', 'Kavner', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'work', 'considering', 'how', 'funny', 'Kavner', 'been', 'Tracey', 'Ullman', 'Show', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movies', 'voice', 'Marge', 'Simpson', 'clever', 'line', 'readings', 'make', 'routines', 'come', 'alive', 'material', 'not', 'funny', 'made', 'worse', 'Ephron', 'cuts', 'audience', 'laughing', 'hysteria', 'Kavner', 'also', ""n't"", 'believable', 'mother', 'more', 'big', 'sister', 'type', 'think', 'miscast', 'playing', 'character', 'who', 'be', 'sympathetic', 'accept', 'following', 'ambition', 'cost', 'responsibilities', 'family', 'Ephron', 'better', 'Kavner', 'two', 'daughters', 'Samantha', 'Morris', 'Gaby', 'Hoffman', 'who', 'give', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'Morris', 'particular', 'revelation', 'sensitive', 'teenager', 'angst', 'embarassed', 'mother', 'Ephron', 'best', 'work', 'way', 'Morris', 'schoolyard', 'romance', 'treading', 'delicate', 'line', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'Morris', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'lines', 'When', 'fans', 'approach', 'mother', 'airport', 'quot', 'Do', 'people', 'coming', 'up', 'not', 'even', 'knocking', 'quot', 'film', 'actually', 'peppered', 'witty', 'dialogue', 'polka', 'dot', 'design', 'fun', 'score', 'Carly', 'Simon', 'major', 'minus', 'featuring', 'irritatingly', 'bland', 'songs', 'performed', 'Watch', 'out', 'Barbara', 'Stewart', 'small', 'role', 'airhead', 'Southern', 'charm', 'sweet', 'funny']",N/A
