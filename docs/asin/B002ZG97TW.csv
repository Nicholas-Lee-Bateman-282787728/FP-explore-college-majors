1303718,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG97TW,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 8]","I was excited about this, for god knows why.  I mean, I have grown tired of Sandler, and I was never really a fan of Schneider, but Spade and Rock and particularly James have always made me laugh, or at least smile, so the prospect of seeing them all together in a `no holds bar' type family comedy seemed interesting, and promising.  In the end though, this film is just awkward.  Sandler has forgotten how to edit and doesn't know when to stop pushing a good thing when he has it.  When you have scenes to establish friendships that consist of nothing more than five minutes of verbal jokes at friends expenses it becomes tired, redundant and, sadly, unfunny.  This also felt like a lazily constructed comedic version of `Why Did I Get Married' too, and that's saying a lot since Tyler Perry's film was pretty lazily put together itself.  The acting is hit or miss, but acting isn't the point here.  It is the endless gags that suffer from being too overly compacted to the point where the audience never gets a break.  It works in that you don't have time to dwell on the failed gags before one that marginally works catches your eye, but in the end `Grown Ups' feels hugely uninspired and preposterous.  The whole `warm family moments' don't ring true and the loopy development of the actual families is so blatantly obviously manufactured that it takes away from the films marginal appeal.  Thankfully Kevin James is funny and Maria Bello is hot.  Outside of those two positives, `Grown Ups' is a clich&eacute;d mess of a film.  The only reason I'm not giving it an F is because I kind of feel like this film is exactly what it wanted to be.",2,"Um, what?",1290988800,"11 29, 2010",2010,1646,"['was', 'excited', 'god', 'why', 'mean', 'have', 'grown', 'tired', 'Sandler', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'fan', 'Schneider', 'Spade', 'Rock', 'particularly', 'James', 'have', 'always', 'made', 'laugh', 'least', 'smile', 'prospect', 'seeing', 'together', 'no', 'bar', 'type', 'family', 'comedy', 'seemed', 'interesting', 'promising', 'end', 'film', 'just', 'awkward', 'Sandler', 'forgotten', 'how', 'edit', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'stop', 'pushing', 'good', 'thing', 'when', 'When', 'have', 'scenes', 'establish', 'friendships', 'consist', 'nothing', 'more', 'five', 'minutes', 'verbal', 'jokes', 'friends', 'expenses', 'tired', 'redundant', 'sadly', 'unfunny', 'also', 'felt', 'lazily', 'constructed', 'comedic', 'version', 'Why', 'Did', 'Get', 'Married', 'too', 'saying', 'lot', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'film', 'was', 'pretty', 'lazily', 'put', 'together', 'acting', 'hit', 'miss', 'acting', ""n't"", 'point', 'here', 'endless', 'gags', 'suffer', 'being', 'too', 'overly', 'compacted', 'point', 'where', 'audience', 'never', 'break', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'dwell', 'failed', 'gags', 'one', 'marginally', 'catches', 'eye', 'end', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'feels', 'hugely', 'uninspired', 'preposterous', 'whole', 'warm', 'family', 'moments', 'do', ""n't"", 'ring', 'true', 'loopy', 'development', 'actual', 'families', 'so', 'blatantly', 'obviously', 'manufactured', 'away', 'films', 'marginal', 'appeal', 'Thankfully', 'Kevin', 'James', 'funny', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'hot', 'two', 'positives', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'clich', 'eacute', 'd', 'mess', 'film', 'only', 'reason', ""'m"", 'not', 'giving', 'F', 'kind', 'feel', 'film', 'exactly', 'what', 'wanted', 'be']",N/A

That's the biggest flaw, and the reason I'm taking away two points from the rating.It of course features big name actors such as Adam Sandler, David Spade and Chris Rock.  Basically the ""storyline"" consists of these famous comedians hanging out together, partying and having fun while on vacation, and just being immature adults.  WAY more immature than their own children, in fact.You might have noticed I put ""storyline"" in parenthesis.  This is because there is honestly no storyline to speak of.  Don't tell me the story focuses on a basketball rematch at the end either because it doesn't.  That particular part basically serves as a brief moment of unfinished business.I personally felt that the humor was pretty hit or miss.  I believe the film is intended more for children, so perhaps that's why some of the jokes didn't register with me.A minor sidestory focuses on the children and how Adam Sandler in particular encourages his own children to appreciate the great outdoors and get away from the video games and cell phones that normally occupy their time.Another problem is that the film suffers from ""too many characters"".  In addition to the ones I mention above, you have *all* their wives and girlfriends, not mention even more people that eventually enter the family (including two VERY attractive ones!).

I still believe it was only his lack of a strong supporting cast that kept it from being truly funny and was also what made it woefully thin on laughs. This is thankfully not the case with Grown Ups. Here Kevin James is well supported by an excellent comedy team and it works very well. My wife reluctantly went with me to see Grown Ups saying that she didn't like ""slapstick comedies"". Well, she laughed much more than I have heard laugh her in a very long time and she came away saying that she really enjoyed the film. The film has done very well at the box office despite many negative reviews (as did Paul Blart: Mall Cop) and it does seem to be much more popular with filmgoers than film critics. I personally think it is a much better and much funnier film than Couples Retreat. It is hard to think of Kevin James as any character other than his The King of Queens ""Doug Heffernan"" and David Spade really just seems to be basically playing a character much like his Rules of Engagement one, Russell in Grown Ups. An added bonus for me in Grown Ups is the presence of the very lovely Maria Bello as the wife of Kevin James. I like the film very much and I had a great time.

Why? Because, in spite of the lack of plot, the movie really is a lot of fun.

You can't help but laugh at the good natured insults traded between life-long friends and see a little bit of yourself in their behavior.This group of five played on a championship basketball team in junior high. Their coach dies and they all come back for the funeral then stay together at a house over the weekend. That's the set up to get them together for the entire film. They spend the time doing things like cooking out, swimming in the lake, going to a water park, and playing basketball.Sandler plays a rich Hollywood agent. Kevin James is unemployed and hiding it from his family. Spade is a irresponsible drunk. Rock is a stay at home husband dominated by his wife. Schneider is married to a woman twice his age. Each family has quirks and issues, but through it all you can see how much they care for each other.This is a good movie about the strength and bond of friendships over the years. Some of the humor isn't appropriate for younger kids, but couples with older children should enjoy the movie. It is full of rapid fire jokes from the all-star cast and an admirable portrait of the American ideals of friendship and family.",4,The critics hated but I enjoyed this comedy featuring the great comedians of our time,1293580800,"12 29, 2010",2010,1501,"['Adam', 'Sandler', 'all-star', 'comedy', 'cast', 'GROWN', 'UPS', 'Critics', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'movie', 'performed', 'quite', 'well', 'box', 'office', 'Why', 'spite', 'lack', 'plot', 'movie', 'really', 'lot', 'fun', 'Much', 'movie', 'filled', 'Sandler', 'Kevin', 'James', 'David', 'Spade', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'trading', 'PG-13', 'type', 'jokes', 'other', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'laugh', 'good', 'natured', 'insults', 'traded', 'life-long', 'friends', 'see', 'little', 'bit', 'behavior.This', 'group', 'five', 'played', 'championship', 'basketball', 'team', 'junior', 'high', 'coach', 'dies', 'come', 'back', 'funeral', 'then', 'stay', 'together', 'house', 'weekend', 'set', 'up', 'get', 'together', 'entire', 'film', 'spend', 'time', 'doing', 'things', 'cooking', 'out', 'swimming', 'lake', 'going', 'water', 'park', 'playing', 'basketball.Sandler', 'rich', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'Kevin', 'James', 'unemployed', 'hiding', 'family', 'Spade', 'irresponsible', 'drunk', 'Rock', 'stay', 'home', 'husband', 'dominated', 'wife', 'Schneider', 'married', 'woman', 'twice', 'age', 'family', 'quirks', 'issues', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'much', 'care', 'other.This', 'good', 'movie', 'strength', 'bond', 'friendships', 'years', 'humor', ""n't"", 'appropriate', 'younger', 'kids', 'couples', 'older', 'children', 'should', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'full', 'rapid', 'fire', 'jokes', 'all-star', 'cast', 'admirable', 'portrait', 'American', 'ideals', 'friendship', 'family']",N/A

1303749,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG97TW,Chris Pandolfi,"[4, 9]","Somewhere within ""Grown Ups"" is a film that can be taken seriously. There are good themes at work: Friendship, family, generation gaps, the ups and downs of marriage, whether or not aging is the same as maturing. The problem is, none of it shines through the murk of its incessant low grade comedy; rather than make us laugh with genuinely funny material, writers Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf rely on juvenile jokes that put all emphasis on unrealistic personality quirks. It's all character and no development. They also go for unpleasant sight gags, including bodily harm, unwanted brief nudity, urinating in the pool, and worst of all, several awkward and disgusting references to breast milk. Forget about the characters - the filmmakers are the ones that need to grow up.The premise centers on five friends, who as kids back in 1978 were part of their school's Basketball team. Thirty years later, we find each of them living completely different lives. Lenny Feder (Sandler) is a successful Hollywood agent. Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James) claims he's the head of a lawn furniture company. Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is a stay-at-home dad. Rob Hilliard (Rob Schneider) is a holistic typecast who seemingly always preferred older women. The only one of the group to have escaped marriage and family is Marcus Higgins (David Spade), an overage sexaholic party animal. Upon the death of the coach who led them to victory, they return to their New England hometown with their families and spend the Fourth of July holiday at a lakeside summer house; here, the five friends will reminisce, fight, rediscover, reveal, and, according to the film's title, grow.For Lenny, it's a personal mission to get his family to see what real life is like. His wife, Roxanne (Salma Hayek Pinault), is a workaholic fashion designer with an impending show in Milan. His two adolescent sons are spoiled, addicted to texting and violent video games, always waited on hand and foot, preferring imported bottled water, accustomed to five-star accommodations at hotels, and apparently unaware that television sets existed before the days of flat screens. They bring along their nanny, a tiresome Asian stereotype (Di Quon), although Lenny desperately tries to convince his friends that she a foreign exchange student and not hired help. Something could have been made of this had it not been overshadowed by shallow, obvious humor; his kids are ridiculous Hollywood caricatures with no traces of believability, and his wife is stylistically out of place, not at all helped by the fact that Salma Hayek was wrong for the role.Other bizarre personalities emerge. Eric's wife, Sally (Maria Bello), still breastfeeds their four-year-old son, and as it so happens, the kid constantly craves milk. Kurt's pregnant wife, Deanne (Maya Rudolph), always takes him for granted and can never say anything nice about his cooking; the same goes for her mother (Ebony Jo-Ann), who's always butting in and has terrible bunions. Rob's wife, Gloria (Joyce Van Patten), is in her mid seventies, while his three daughters - two of them smoking hot bimbos, one a dorky misfit - spend as much time as they can being the source of many appearance-related jokes. Rob is the film's worst character, fleshed out solely by exaggerated holistic traits and general social and physical oddness; one wonders how he could ever be friends with the other four, or rather, how they could ever be friends with him.The film's climax involves a Basketball rematch between the five friends and their former rivals, led by Colin Quinn, who always believed the game from thirty years ago was unfairly won. While there is a moral to this scene, it doesn't resonate, and that's because it's masked by the film's immature tone. It's also delivered far too late in the story, at which point we no longer care about the characters or their circumstances. I'm well aware that humor can often times be found in very serious situations, but that's not what's going on here; it's a sophomoric and silly buddy film through and through. The more reserved and mature themes near the end seem like afterthoughts, as if Sandler and Wolf decided at the last minute to decided to tack them on. That way, their screenplay could actually be about something.To me, this isn't a question of whether or not you're an Adam Sandler fan. I say this because every review I've read seems to think this somehow matters: ""If you're an Adam Sandler fan, you're going to like this movie."" How about if you're a fan of comedy? I think that's the real criteria, here. I very much consider myself a fan. The thing is, even comedies should have standards, and in the case of ""Grown Ups,"" they're in short supply. It has no ambition other than to be goofy and gross. It generates laughs not by respecting the intelligence of the audience, but simply by appealing to the lowest common denominator. On a more positive note, I will give David Spade credit for being the only actor I know of to successfully say ""grody,"" a word that hasn't been popular for quite some time.",2,I'm a Big Kid

1303753,ALLIGF5OZM1I6,B002ZG97TW,Craig Whittle,"[0, 1]","GROWN UPSSTARRING: Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph, Joyce Van Patten, Ebony Jo-Ann, Colin Quinn, Steve Buscemi, Tim Meadows and Di QuonWRITTEN BY: Fred Wolf and Adam SandlerDIRECTED BY: Dennis DuganRated: PG - 13Genre: ComedyRelease Date: 25 June 2010Review Date: 27 July 2010We haven't had what I'd call a true `Adam Sandler movie', since 2007's I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry; meaning that while Funny People was perfect, it felt more of Judd Apatow than Sandler. And I was disappointed by You Don't Mess with the Zohan and I could have done without Bedtime Stories all together. Luckily for me and other die-hard fans of this comedic genius, Grown Ups has Sandler back on the right track to his accredited style of classic movies like Big Daddy, Anger Management, 50 First Dates, The Waterboy and Happy Gilmore; true Sandler flicks.Grown Ups is directed by one of my favorite comedy directors, Dennis Dugan. With four other Adam Sandler movies under his belt, as well as other great comedies such as Saving Silverman, Problem Child, The Benchwarmers and National Security; it's no wonder he was hired to direct the powerhouse of talent showcased in Grown Ups.Some of the best in the business of goofball-ism can be found here. I won't even use character names, because it'll only get confusing. Sandler, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, David Spade and Kevin James are five friends who reunite at a lake house in the woods after their childhood basketball coach has passed away. Their love interests are Salma Hayek (Sandler's wife), Maria Bello (married to James), Maya Rudolph (Rock's wife) and Joyce Patten (Schneider's much older wife). Oh yeah, and David Spade plays the classic single guy who will probably never settle down; and he steals a majority of the laughs.Grown Ups wasn't flawless like so many of Sandler's other pictures have been, but it is one of his most fun. It's a real treat to see all these guys in action together, and we can only imagine the blast they must have had filming this. The movie is enjoyable because all the actors are aware that it's a little ridiculous at times, but we feel this through their performances and it allows us to sit back and laugh with them.We have grown ups peeing in a pool, Kevin James falling from a rope swing like an idiot, Chris Rock lending his talent of ripping on real life celebrities via the characters in the movie, a four-year-old breast feeding which spawns countless jokes and etc, etc.Perhaps the most enjoyable comedic gag for me, were the scenes where Rob Schneider's daughters come to visit. They are dashingly attractive and we get a kick out of watching Schneider's four pals drooling over them. Schneider plays the odd man out as his woman is seriously elderly; he's the little one of the pack, and the most eccentric. The role is given a genuine justice by Schneider.And what would a Sandler flick be without his entourage of side characters? We've got plenty of `em to go around, including the always brilliantly clever Steve Buscemi, and at last somebody gave the underrated Colin Quinn a worthy role. He plays the leader of the rivalry basketball team that our guys won with the coach all those years ago. Even Tim Meadows shows up for a minute and squares off with Chris Rock in a scene that had me in stitches too.Then there are the ladies. Sandler has been blessed to work with some very good dramatic actresses throughout his career, that bring a lot of light to his screw-ball flicks, varying from Marissa Tomei to Kate Beckinsale. This time around he shares the screen with Maria Bello and Salma Hayek, and both give decent performances. Maya Rudolph, Joyce Van Patten and Ebony Jo-Ann all deliver funny moments too.Grown Ups is a perfect movie to slip into, relax, and have a good time with during the scorching heat of the summer. It'll make you wanna call up old pals, do some family activities, and there are even a few well written positive themes nestled in here for us too; particularly surrounding the very warm and original ending, which I loved. No, it's not The Hangover, but Grown Ups is certainly a good appetizer to hold us over till The Hangover 2 comes out next summer.P.S.:Stick around after the credits for a heartfelt song from Adam Sandler to his dad who recently passed.",4,Grown Ups Review,1280880000,"08 4, 2010",2010,4353,"['GROWN', 'UPSSTARRING', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Kevin', 'James', 'David', 'Spade', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Ebony', 'Jo-Ann', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'Di', 'QuonWRITTEN', 'BY', 'Fred', 'Wolf', 'Adam', 'SandlerDIRECTED', 'BY', 'Dennis', 'DuganRated', 'PG', '13Genre', 'ComedyRelease', 'Date', '25', 'June', '2010Review', 'Date', '27', 'July', '2010We', 'have', ""n't"", 'had', 'what', ""'d"", 'call', 'true', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', '2007', 'Now', 'Pronounce', 'Chuck', 'Larry', 'meaning', 'Funny', 'People', 'was', 'perfect', 'felt', 'more', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'Sandler', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Mess', 'Zohan', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'Bedtime', 'Stories', 'together', 'Luckily', 'other', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'comedic', 'genius', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'Sandler', 'back', 'right', 'track', 'accredited', 'style', 'classic', 'movies', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'Anger', 'Management', '50', 'First', 'Dates', 'Waterboy', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'true', 'Sandler', 'flicks.Grown', 'Ups', 'directed', 'one', 'favorite', 'comedy', 'directors', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'four', 'other', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'belt', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'great', 'comedies', 'such', 'Saving', 'Silverman', 'Problem', 'Child', 'Benchwarmers', 'National', 'Security', 'wonder', 'was', 'hired', 'direct', 'powerhouse', 'talent', 'showcased', 'Grown', 'Ups.Some', 'best', 'business', 'goofball-ism', 'can', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'wo', ""n't"", 'even', 'use', 'character', 'names', ""'ll"", 'only', 'get', 'confusing', 'Sandler', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'David', 'Spade', 'Kevin', 'James', 'are', 'five', 'friends', 'who', 'reunite', 'lake', 'house', 'woods', 'childhood', 'basketball', 'coach', 'passed', 'away', 'love', 'interests', 'are', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Sandler', 'wife', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'married', 'James', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Rock', 'wife', 'Joyce', 'Patten', 'Schneider', 'much', 'older', 'wife', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'David', 'Spade', 'classic', 'single', 'guy', 'who', 'will', 'probably', 'never', 'settle', 'down', 'majority', 'laughs.Grown', 'Ups', 'was', ""n't"", 'flawless', 'so', 'many', 'Sandler', 'other', 'pictures', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'most', 'fun', 'real', 'treat', 'see', 'guys', 'action', 'together', 'can', 'only', 'imagine', 'blast', 'must', 'have', 'had', 'filming', 'movie', 'enjoyable', 'actors', 'are', 'aware', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'times', 'feel', 'performances', 'sit', 'back', 'laugh', 'them.We', 'have', 'grown', 'ups', 'peeing', 'pool', 'Kevin', 'James', 'falling', 'rope', 'swing', 'idiot', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'lending', 'talent', 'ripping', 'real', 'life', 'celebrities', 'characters', 'movie', 'four-year-old', 'breast', 'feeding', 'countless', 'jokes', 'etc', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'comedic', 'gag', 'were', 'scenes', 'where', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'daughters', 'come', 'visit', 'are', 'dashingly', 'attractive', 'get', 'kick', 'watching', 'Schneider', 'four', 'pals', 'drooling', 'Schneider', 'odd', 'man', 'out', 'woman', 'seriously', 'elderly', 'little', 'one', 'pack', 'most', 'eccentric', 'role', 'given', 'genuine', 'justice', 'Schneider.And', 'would', 'Sandler', 'flick', 'be', 'entourage', 'side', 'characters', ""'ve"", 'got', 'plenty', 'em', 'go', 'around', 'including', 'always', 'brilliantly', 'clever', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'last', 'somebody', 'gave', 'underrated', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'worthy', 'role', 'leader', 'rivalry', 'basketball', 'team', 'guys', 'won', 'coach', 'years', 'ago', 'Even', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'up', 'minute', 'off', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'scene', 'had', 'stitches', 'are', 'ladies', 'Sandler', 'been', 'blessed', 'work', 'very', 'good', 'dramatic', 'actresses', 'career', 'bring', 'lot', 'light', 'screw-ball', 'flicks', 'varying', 'Marissa', 'Tomei', 'Kate', 'Beckinsale', 'time', 'shares', 'screen', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'give', 'decent', 'performances', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Ebony', 'Jo-Ann', 'deliver', 'funny', 'moments', 'too.Grown', 'Ups', 'perfect', 'movie', 'slip', 'relax', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'scorching', 'heat', 'summer', ""'ll"", 'make', 'wan', 'call', 'up', 'old', 'pals', 'do', 'family', 'activities', 'are', 'even', 'few', 'well', 'written', 'positive', 'themes', 'nestled', 'here', 'too', 'particularly', 'surrounding', 'very', 'warm', 'original', 'ending', 'loved', 'No', 'not', 'Hangover', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'certainly', 'good', 'appetizer', 'hold', 'Hangover', '2', 'out', 'next', 'summer.P.S', 'Stick', 'credits', 'heartfelt', 'song', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'dad', 'who', 'recently', 'passed']",N/A

Many of the jokes were forced and apparently not re-shot. Some of the jokes and situations were hilarious, but were then followed immediately by a clunker. It was like going to an expensive restaurant where one course would be outstanding, the next lousy. Overall, a bad experience. Nothing close to ""The Hangover"" and other movies that find their mark with oddball situations and shock comedy.The story was good enough, but the writing and the delivery was often lacking.They went for the gross-out factor in some of the situations (the old, sexually open wife, the breast-feeding mom with her 4-year old - in public), and they just didn't work.This is one of Sandler's worst movies. Doesn't begin to compare to Big Daddy and some of his other classics. It struggled to include some of the warmth of his other movies, but at times did well in that area.The way they inserted so many of Sandler's ex-SNL buddies into uninspired roles, it felt like Sandler was just giving his buddies a payday. He's probably the most successful guy in the bunch, and some of them have not had much work lately, except for David Spade and Kevin James, and maybe Chris Rock.Salma Hayek was hot, as usual, but she apparently does not have comic chops.

1303778,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ZG97TW,Ed Uyeshima,"[2, 2]","""Droningly predictable"" is the only way I can describe this 2010 Adam Sandler cookie-cutter comedy with any clarity. Like the dehydrated banana that Sandler uses to hit Rob Schneider's face repeatedly, I felt a certain numbness sitting through the longest 102 minutes I can recall experiencing a movie at home. Working from a script co-written by Sandler and Fred Wolf, director Dennis Dugan, a longtime Sandler handler, appears to be going for a slapstick version ofThe Big Chillwith a far more superficial sense of introspection. The story, such that it is, focuses on five elementary school buddies who gather over thirty years later for the funeral of their beloved basketball coach. With their families in tow, they turn the event into a weeklong reunion at a lakeside cabin in New England. At first, the sight of Sandler with his old SNL buddies Schneider, David Spade and Chris Rock, along with Kevin James (obviously filling in for the late Chris Farley), is encouraging given their genuinely funny ribbing of each other. I wouldn't be surprised to find out if they ad-libbed most of their lines in this scene.However, the film quickly degenerates into a standard, ""Yours, Mine & Ours""-level sitcom with heavy doses of sentimentality interspersed with goofball humor fluctuating between innocuous and tasteless. Sandler plays high-powered Hollywood agent Lenny Feder who is afraid his spoiled kids have lost touch with their humanity and the simple joys he enjoyed as a child like skipping stones. The other comics play stock roles - James as Eric, a failed lawn furniture salesman and the butt of all the mandatory fat jokes, Rock as Kurt, an emasculated, Food Network-obsessed househusband married to a career superwoman pregnant with their third child; Spade as Marcus, a womanizing horndog who refuses to settle down; and Schneider as Rob, a New age-spouting massage therapist married to a woman three decades his senior Each goes through a midlife crisis that requires some amount of personal humiliation before the power of their friendship kicks in. There are plenty of set-up scenes and sight gags that may produce a mild chuckle before the inevitable showdown with a rival basketball team.While it's good to see fellow SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph play Kurt's wife, it is something of a head-scratcher to see actresses of the caliber of Salma Hayek and Maria Bello take such flimsy parts in this production. Hayek plays Lenny's fashionista wife as if she's auditioning for Sofia Vergara's role inModern Family, while Bello is trivialized into a running sight gag constantly seen breastfeeding her character's four-year-old son. Familiar character actress Joyce Van Patten (Dick's sister and the director's ex-wife) has the most humiliating moments aggressively pursuing Schneider for sex. Steve Buscemi shows up late in the story as one of Lenny's hometown nemeses and ends up in a body cast for an extended sight gag. There is little else to say about the film except to say if you are not a die-hard fan of Sandler's, you should consider alternative entertainment. The 2011 DVD offers three short featurettes - two focused on the making-of aspects of the film and the third a gag reel. The Blu-Ray adds deleted scenes, a commentary track from Dugan with none of the principal actors participating, an Apatow-type blooper reel called a ""Riff-o-Rama"", and three additional shorts focusing on the behind-the-scenes details.",2,Weakly Rambunctious Sandler Vehicle Comes Across as a Tepid Home Movie,1300838400,"03 23, 2011",2011,3435,"['Droningly', 'predictable', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'describe', '2010', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'cookie-cutter', 'comedy', 'clarity', 'dehydrated', 'banana', 'Sandler', 'hit', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'face', 'repeatedly', 'felt', 'certain', 'numbness', 'sitting', 'longest', '102', 'minutes', 'can', 'recall', 'experiencing', 'movie', 'home', 'Working', 'script', 'co-written', 'Sandler', 'Fred', 'Wolf', 'director', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'longtime', 'Sandler', 'handler', 'be', 'going', 'slapstick', 'version', 'ofThe', 'Big', 'Chillwith', 'far', 'more', 'superficial', 'sense', 'introspection', 'story', 'such', 'focuses', 'five', 'elementary', 'school', 'buddies', 'who', 'gather', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'funeral', 'beloved', 'basketball', 'coach', 'families', 'tow', 'turn', 'event', 'weeklong', 'reunion', 'lakeside', 'cabin', 'New', 'England', 'first', 'sight', 'Sandler', 'old', 'SNL', 'buddies', 'Schneider', 'David', 'Spade', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Kevin', 'James', 'obviously', 'filling', 'late', 'Chris', 'Farley', 'encouraging', 'given', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'ribbing', 'other', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'ad-libbed', 'most', 'lines', 'scene.However', 'film', 'quickly', 'standard', 'Yours', 'Mine', 'Ours', '-level', 'sitcom', 'heavy', 'doses', 'sentimentality', 'interspersed', 'goofball', 'humor', 'fluctuating', 'innocuous', 'tasteless', 'Sandler', 'high-powered', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'Lenny', 'Feder', 'who', 'afraid', 'spoiled', 'kids', 'have', 'lost', 'touch', 'humanity', 'simple', 'joys', 'enjoyed', 'child', 'skipping', 'stones', 'other', 'comics', 'play', 'stock', 'roles', 'James', 'Eric', 'failed', 'lawn', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'butt', 'mandatory', 'fat', 'jokes', 'Rock', 'Kurt', 'emasculated', 'Food', 'Network-obsessed', 'househusband', 'married', 'career', 'superwoman', 'pregnant', 'third', 'child', 'Spade', 'Marcus', 'womanizing', 'horndog', 'who', 'settle', 'down', 'Schneider', 'Rob', 'New', 'age-spouting', 'massage', 'therapist', 'married', 'woman', 'three', 'senior', 'midlife', 'crisis', 'amount', 'personal', 'humiliation', 'power', 'friendship', 'kicks', 'are', 'plenty', 'set-up', 'scenes', 'sight', 'gags', 'may', 'produce', 'mild', 'chuckle', 'inevitable', 'showdown', 'rival', 'basketball', 'good', 'see', 'fellow', 'SNL', 'alumnus', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'play', 'Kurt', 'wife', 'something', 'head-scratcher', 'see', 'actresses', 'caliber', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'take', 'such', 'flimsy', 'parts', 'production', 'Hayek', 'Lenny', 'fashionista', 'wife', 'auditioning', 'Sofia', 'Vergara', 'role', 'inModern', 'Family', 'Bello', 'trivialized', 'running', 'sight', 'gag', 'constantly', 'seen', 'breastfeeding', 'character', 'four-year-old', 'son', 'Familiar', 'character', 'actress', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'Dick', 'sister', 'director', 'ex-wife', 'most', 'humiliating', 'moments', 'aggressively', 'pursuing', 'Schneider', 'sex', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'up', 'late', 'story', 'one', 'Lenny', 'hometown', 'nemeses', 'up', 'body', 'cast', 'extended', 'sight', 'gag', 'little', 'else', 'say', 'film', 'say', 'are', 'not', 'die-hard', 'fan', 'Sandler', 'should', 'consider', 'alternative', 'entertainment', '2011', 'DVD', 'offers', 'three', 'short', 'featurettes', 'two', 'focused', 'making-of', 'aspects', 'film', 'third', 'gag', 'reel', 'Blu-Ray', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'commentary', 'track', 'Dugan', 'none', 'principal', 'actors', 'participating', 'Apatow-type', 'blooper', 'reel', 'called', 'Riff-o-Rama', 'three', 'additional', 'shorts', 'focusing', 'behind-the-scenes', 'details']",N/A

1303786,A2ZB8B7VQONZA6,B002ZG97TW,"fmwaalex ""fmwaalex""","[2, 5]","GROWN UPSI am a huge Kevin James fan and have not missed one of his films at the theaters, so of course I had to go see this film. Add in that I am a huge David Spade, Chris Rock, Adam Sandler, and Rob Schneider fan and I just can't have a bad time at this movie. Now I will say from the get go this film is not for everybody and I have noticed that some people just don't get this film. This film is basically what the title says, growing up, and well finding your self again as well. This film was not meant as one of Sandler's usual over the top comedies and it is not one of is more serious films either, this film is some where in between. It also helps if you can identify with the characters in this, and it also helps that there is a scene in which Salma Hayek rivals her snake dance scene in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" for her sexiest look ever.The film is about five childhood friends who are reunited after their school basketball coach passes away. It is here that they decide to spend the weekend together and reconnect with the families that are driving them crazy. Here is the thing about this film it is really not only about the grown ups finding themselves again but about their kids becoming kids. If you get these going in you will have a good time with this flick, I also love that the friends spend the whole time shooting one liners at each other and making fun of each other. Sure it sounds mean but that is exactly what me and my friends do so I could identify with the characters. Now this is all in good fun trying to one up the other and is absolutely a real thing that real friends do, well at least with guys not sure about that ladies. But I will say that my girl joins in with us so I can say some of the women out there do this at least.Written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf and directed by Dennis Dugan you know what kind of film you are in for. But it is with the script and the direction that things do go wrong a bit. The script is lacking a little if you are looking for an over the top laugh a minute comedy, but if you are looking for a more realistic one this is for you. The one thing that is not up for debate is the performances, they are top notch here. I'll start with my boy Kevin James and once again he is perfect here. He plays a family man that seems to be living a great life but has a wife that still breast feeds his 4 year old son. David Spade much like is role on the Happy Madison produced TV series ""Rules of Engagement"" is the loner playboy type still looking for women all the time.Chris Rock plays a stay at home dad who is underappreciated much like any stay at home parent, never understood that in this society. Rearing kids and taking care of basically everyone of the family member's lives as well as the house is the most important job. Don't get me wrong whoever is the person in the family out there working to pay the bills and feed the fam is just as important, and well that is what Rock's part of the film is saying. Both jobs are vital in the family, don't know why that turned into a rant. Rob Schneider did a great job here as well as the Earthy, one with nature type who happens to love older women, much older women. Of course Adam Sandler plays the big shot Hollywood guy with a fashion designer wife, so of course they are living very well. Also one of the greatest actors ever Steve Buscemi is here in this flick along side Colin Quinn and Tim Meadows as some jealous jerks from the boy's past.Now while the boys have been promoted as center stage in this film the ladies play just as big a role in this film and do so wonderfully. Joyce Van Patten, Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello, the hilarious Ebony Jo-Ann and of course the always super hot Salma Hayek. They are all excellent in this film as the wives and in Ebony's case mother in law of the guys, all do an excellent job. But I can't help but tell you that at one point in this film Salma Hayek is in a cheerleader outfit with pig tails and well just looking like every boys fantasy. This scene rivals her snake dance scene in the excellent ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" has just plain great to watch, I need a drink of water.Well now that we have that out of the way I must say that I had a great time watching this movie. I took my girl and her Nieces and nephew to see this flick for part of her Birthday week, my Bro came as well.

1303802,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B002ZG97TW,Jason,"[3, 6]","The title, previews, and premise give the appearance that viewers will be treated to a post-adolescent brand of comedy, where childish thoughts and acts are left behind for a more refined sense family and friendship, but oftentimes a more crude and adult brand of humor.  Unfortunately, this is not what happens.  Instead, shackled by the desire to remain family-friendly, the movie comes off as a cheap version ofCouples Retreatwith less legitimate laughs.Five best friends in the late 70s, a championship basketball team, coached by a man who had a profound influence on their lives, reunite some thirty years later when coach dies.  The young boys are now family men (Sandler, Rock, Spade, Schneider, James) - some successful, some not, others typecast misfits - who must return to their triumphant boyhood memories to reminisce, reflect, bust each others' balls, and generally enjoy themselves in spite of the somber occasion.  Sounds fun, right!?  The problem: they bring their families, full of associated oddities and difficulties.  This is a problem because Sandler and co-writer Ron Wolf got stuck in between target audiences.  For every chuckle-worthy crack delivered between old friends (i.e. adult humor) there are two completely unfunny moments that spoiled quicker than breast-milk.The casting in and of itself is stupendous, and I see their demographically influenced intentions, but the results are subtraction by addition.  Reuniting old SNL cast-members and various comic friends, with James providing a poor man's Farley, is obviously for young adults.  Adding in Selma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph was a great way to keep the adult male audience entertained (not to mention the addition of two gorgeous, bikini-clad women, Jamie Chung and Madison Riley).  A wise cracking Big Momma rip-off was added alongside a really lame comedy skit (with Tim Meadows) from Rock's 1999 routine explicitly for the Tyler Perry audience.  A woman in her mid-70s was added (as Schneider's wife, ugh) to bring in the Metamucil crowd.  Sprinkle in a several kids, some of them completely loathsome, and the result is movie meatloaf.Unfortunately, the screenplay is not much better.  Far too often there is a reliance on retread jokes and situations, which accentuates the movie's recycled feeling.  Flawed and disjointed, it's once again target audience ambivalence.  Either the kids deliver the one-liners to elicit the ""awwws,"" or the adults deliver for ""guffaws.""  You can't have it both ways.  When the gags are humorous, however, it's best not to use them until glue oozes from the horse.  Clearly Sandler has never heard the phrase ""less is more.""Overall, the direction and result of ""Grown Ups"" is one that never fulfills the promise of the title.  Instead, growth is stunted; stuck in the voice-cracking, awkward pubescent years, the ensemble relies upon sounds and fluids from various bodily orifices to fill plot gaps during their movie version of a roast, while futile attempts at sentimentality and misplaced life-lessons muddy the waters.  It's clear making the movie was a blast, but watching it pales in comparison.  The movie, much like Sandler, is stuck in perpetual puberty.Jason Elin",2,Perpetual Puberty,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",2010,3210,"['title', 'previews', 'premise', 'give', 'appearance', 'viewers', 'will', 'be', 'treated', 'post-adolescent', 'brand', 'comedy', 'where', 'childish', 'thoughts', 'acts', 'are', 'left', 'more', 'refined', 'sense', 'family', 'friendship', 'more', 'crude', 'adult', 'brand', 'humor', 'Unfortunately', 'not', 'what', 'Instead', 'shackled', 'desire', 'remain', 'family-friendly', 'movie', 'off', 'cheap', 'version', 'ofCouples', 'Retreatwith', 'less', 'legitimate', 'laughs.Five', 'best', 'friends', 'late', '70s', 'championship', 'basketball', 'team', 'coached', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'profound', 'influence', 'lives', 'reunite', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'when', 'coach', 'young', 'boys', 'are', 'now', 'family', 'men', 'Sandler', 'Rock', 'Spade', 'Schneider', 'James', 'successful', 'not', 'others', 'typecast', 'misfits', 'who', 'must', 'return', 'triumphant', 'boyhood', 'memories', 'reminisce', 'reflect', 'bust', 'others', 'balls', 'generally', 'enjoy', 'spite', 'somber', 'occasion', 'fun', 'right', 'problem', 'bring', 'families', 'full', 'associated', 'oddities', 'difficulties', 'problem', 'Sandler', 'co-writer', 'Ron', 'Wolf', 'got', 'stuck', 'target', 'audiences', 'chuckle-worthy', 'crack', 'delivered', 'old', 'friends', 'i.e', 'adult', 'humor', 'are', 'two', 'completely', 'unfunny', 'moments', 'spoiled', 'quicker', 'breast-milk.The', 'casting', 'stupendous', 'see', 'demographically', 'influenced', 'intentions', 'results', 'are', 'subtraction', 'addition', 'Reuniting', 'old', 'SNL', 'cast-members', 'various', 'comic', 'friends', 'James', 'providing', 'poor', 'man', 'Farley', 'obviously', 'young', 'adults', 'Adding', 'Selma', 'Hayek', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'was', 'great', 'way', 'keep', 'adult', 'male', 'audience', 'entertained', 'not', 'mention', 'addition', 'two', 'gorgeous', 'bikini-clad', 'women', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'Madison', 'Riley', 'wise', 'cracking', 'Big', 'Momma', 'rip-off', 'was', 'added', 'really', 'lame', 'comedy', 'skit', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'Rock', '1999', 'routine', 'explicitly', 'Tyler', 'Perry', 'audience', 'woman', 'mid-70s', 'was', 'added', 'Schneider', 'wife', 'ugh', 'bring', 'Metamucil', 'crowd', 'Sprinkle', 'several', 'kids', 'completely', 'loathsome', 'result', 'movie', 'meatloaf.Unfortunately', 'screenplay', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'Far', 'too', 'often', 'reliance', 'retread', 'jokes', 'situations', 'movie', 'recycled', 'feeling', 'Flawed', 'disjointed', 'once', 'again', 'target', 'audience', 'ambivalence', 'kids', 'deliver', 'one-liners', 'elicit', 'awwws', 'adults', 'deliver', 'guffaws', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'ways', 'When', 'gags', 'are', 'humorous', 'however', 'best', 'not', 'use', 'glue', 'oozes', 'horse', 'Clearly', 'Sandler', 'never', 'heard', 'phrase', 'less', 'more', 'Overall', 'direction', 'result', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'one', 'never', 'promise', 'title', 'Instead', 'growth', 'stunted', 'stuck', 'voice-cracking', 'awkward', 'pubescent', 'years', 'ensemble', 'relies', 'sounds', 'fluids', 'various', 'bodily', 'orifices', 'fill', 'plot', 'gaps', 'movie', 'version', 'roast', 'futile', 'attempts', 'sentimentality', 'misplaced', 'life-lessons', 'waters', 'clear', 'making', 'movie', 'was', 'blast', 'watching', 'comparison', 'movie', 'much', 'Sandler', 'stuck', 'perpetual', 'puberty.Jason', 'Elin']",N/A

They might as well have just recorded themselves unscripted hanging out and released it as a movie.While the funny Kevin James is just wasted in all these Happy Madison movies as their new fat clumsy guy.

1303809,A6X6LNZO1C3EZ,B002ZG97TW,J. Munyon,"[2, 3]","""Grown Ups"" hit the DVD version late this year (2010).  It stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider, Steve Buscemi, Tim Meadows, and Colin Quinn.  With that cast, try to guess if this is supposed to be taken seriously.  Rob Schneider wears an Elvis toupee and sings ""Ave Maria"" at a funeral.  Think about it for a minute.It's rated PG-13 because a stunt double appears to be David Spade from behind, not wearing any pants (or skivvies).  The humor is crude and there's some women getting ogled, but the women in the movie portraying the wives are at a pool and they check out a guy in a body-builder physique and not much else, as if the women were cougars.  So I wouldn't necessarily the movie is sexist without balance.The funniest thing in the movie is the bow and arrow game, where the males shoot an arrow straight up out of sight and the first guy to move is a sissy, the last guy to move is the most courageous.  They call that game ""arrow roulette.""It's just a bunch of guys who grew up together and now they're married with kids; getting back together for a reunion when a shared basketball coach dies and they all show up for the funeral.  Interestingly enough, Adam Sandler has a hot wife from Italy, successful enough to have a nanny for their kids; and Kevin James has a wife who still breast feeds a 4 year old boy.  The only one not married is David Spade, who never quite decided to settle down and get into the rut of being an adult.  Most of the marriages are dysfunctional, and nearly all the kids are undesirable little spoiled brats who have no idea about manners, sharing, or having fun without electronics.As I said in my opening paragraph, this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously and it is predominantly a set up for sight gags, verbal slams, fart jokes, nut shots and making fun of each other for whatever shortcoming each has.  Supposedly they meet at a lake house and decide to learn how to rediscover being civil to each other and making their marriages better.  Gag me with a spoon.The humor scattered here and there is actually good for a dozen or so chuckles, and there are some really hot babes on this movie, some in bikinis, and some in hot pants tight outfits.  There are also some fugly girls too, so it's not just a flick for little boys to pant over.  Kevin James performs perhaps the most predictable lame duck effort on a rope swing out over a lake - doesn't let go, and comes back to bash into a tree.  That's the style of humor.  Which although overplayed, you can't help but laugh at.  Light-hearted, slapstick, and purposefully stupid.  It's a comedy, not a drama.  Get over it.  It is kind of like Saturday Night Live blended into a movie format.A woman saying she is confessing she used to be a man, but is lying just to get their reaction; another woman obviously pregnant, when congratulated says she isn't pregnant, just to get their reaction . . . . . etc etc",4,"Not great, but it doesn't suck.

1303816,AJX8Q5CKA59DJ,B002ZG97TW,"JournalStone ""Duncan Moron""","[5, 9]","I found this movie to be laugh out loud funny, but the storyline, plot, and acting were all filled with several holes.  I almost feel like I could hit copy/paste when reviewing some of the recent comedic theatrical releases.  There just wasn't any depth here, but it doesn't mean I didn't enjoy several of the slapstick jokes being played out.  If you like the old ""Three Stooges"" you will most likely enjoy this film.  Not that I would compare this mediocre release to a classic, but the head slapping was all too familiar.Adam Sandler is a big time Hollywood agent who has lost any form of connection with his kids.  They sit around all day playing play station while ordering their nanny around.  Not that I condone physical violence, but if I were the nanny and a kid complained about the specific type of chocolate I used in his drink, I might drag him out to the front yard by his ear and do a little ping pong on his back side.  Dude, if you want to wonder why your kids are abusing the nanny, then you might want to stop teaching them how to text her instructions/orders.  First step, stop doing it yourself.Adam Sandler, David Spade, Kevin James, Chris Rock and Rob Schneider were the starting five of the only championship team ever to be coached in their small hometown.  Sadly, the coach has died and everyone is heading home to the funereal.  We all have had those moments/influences in our childhood and ""the coach"" was impactful on these five boys and their future lives.  So they all head home with their families in tow, and the rumpus re-living of long lost youth begins.For me this is where the story could have gone two directions.  It could have been a thoughtfully laid out plot, with several comedic scenes.  When you have all of these stars in one movie, you expect some laughs.  Instead it went the easy route, and we spend the next hour watching David Spade and Rob Schneider getting smacked in the face several times while avoiding falling arrows plummeting from the sky.  I am not a huge Rob Schneider fan, but watching him interact with his wife, who exceeds him in age by 25 years or so, led to me laughing uncontrollably on several occasions.  For the record, I said the show was all slapstick.  I never said that I didn't enjoy some of the knock down humor at times.As with all plot lacking movies, the ending was all too cheesy as the director suddenly decided to teach us a life lesson instead of continuing with the mindless humor.  In my book this is always what differentiates the great comedies from the mediocre ones.  If you are building up your audience for an hour plus on thoughtless humor, don't try ending the movie with anything more than thoughtless humor.  It really does insult our intelligence.  So with their rivals in place the five take another stab at beating their basketball rivals in a big basketball finale, which falls about as short as they do in their forty year old middle aged bodies.I again think we as the audience should be able to pick up on the clues commercials give us and make educated decisions.  I went into this movie thinking it would be nothing more than exactly what it was.  Not that I am not surprised both positively and negatively at times, but this movie was pretty clear on what you were getting and with that I think it delivered.  I had several laughs, some of them pretty darn loud, and I didn't have to think at all, for even a single second.

This is absolutely the case for ""Grown Ups"" which opened last weekend.""Grown Ups."" has an all star cast, most of which came from the 1990's Saturday Night Live cast, including Adam Sandler, David Spade, Chris Rock and Rob Schneider. The films starts with a group of gown men returning to their hometown to attend the funeral of a high school basketball coach. The men remember earlier days before the onslaught of video games, when children played outside until it was dark. This film co-written by Sandler had potential to be a funny, heart-warming family film. But it looks as if Sandler took the easy way out. The film is just a long series of skits that are often repeated more than once and with every minute become more lame and offensive.Please, take my advise. If you want to see Adam Sandler in a film worth watching, out on DVD is ""Funny People."" This film, made last year is a drama, but has enough funny moments to quench your Adam Sandler thirst.

1303847,A36EW68H08UOCS,B002ZG97TW,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[5, 8]","""Grown Ups"", co-written by Adam Sandler and directed by Dennis Dugan (Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy) looks as if it might have been enjoyable for a few of the cast and crew to make, but it is more painful than a prostate exam to watch.Sandler joins Chris Rock, Kevin James, Rob Schneider and David Spade as the 30 years later version of a team of 12 year olds who won the only basketball championship EVER for a beloved coach who we learn has just died.  The Grown Ups reassemble for the funeral. Sandler's character is self-conscious about the fact that he is a successful Hollywood Agent and is married to Salma Hayek (a successful designer who is about to have a show in Milan) and obnoxious kids; the rest of the ""team"" have all grown up to be some flavor of loser with a capital L.There is a genre of film I would call the ""brainless teenager summer sex comedy"" and they are a staple of multiplexes every year beginning with spring break.  Sandler and company apparently got the idea of ""what if we made one of these where the characters were all... Grown Ups!!""  I watched the film wondering how many times during its development there might have been a legitimate opportunity for someone in charge to say ""you know what?  This is a REALLY bad idea for a movie"" and then stop making the movie.The characters all meet at the coach's funeral after an opening sequence where each of the characters is told of the death in one painful moment after another.  Then we learn Sandler has rented a cabin - the same one where ""the team"" celebrated their championship 30 years earlier.  Twenty or so people all pile into the cabin.  Hey, we've got Chris Rock and David Spade, etc here - we should be able to just turn the camera on and record us trying to crack each other up!The script functions as little more than an opportunity for the characters to be extremely rude to each other.  Schneider's character is married to Joyce Van Patten - 75 years old - and rather than celebrate the possibility that a geriatric character could be involved in a loving relationship, it instead offers all the wise guys an opportunity to express their grossed-outness.  (I would SERIOUSLY like to know how Ms. Van Patten felt working on this film as the scenes begin to pile up stating in various inappropriate and insulting ways that old women like her are GRO-dy.) Schneider also has three estranged daughters (who all randomly choose this weekend to randomly end their estrangement!) and although the last one we meet looks like a chip off the ol' block (Schneider's character endures a long stream of insults and at one point is described as looking like a dirty Q-tip) the first two daughters are swimsuit models which gives the other guys 1. An opportunity for the other characters to insult Schneider (how did THAT come from THAT?) and 2. A chance to inappropriately ogle the scantily dressed daughters, who spend the rest of the movie bent over open car hoods or up ladders.A word for the filmmakers: a 75 year old person in a loving relationship is not NEARLY as grody as 45 year old men leering at teenagers.Rock's character is the emasculated house-husband to pregnant bread-winner Maya Rudolph, but this family's inclusion in the film seems to be to allow opportunities for fart jokes involving Ebony Jo-Ann (as Rudolph's mother)  up to and including ""blaming it on the dog."" James is married to breast-feeding Maria Bello and no, there is pretty much no substance excreted by man or woman that is not introduced in a cringe-worthy lowest-common-denominator attempt to evoke laughter. James serves as the butt of multiple fat jokes. (While working on the script I wonder if they considered making fun of religions and the handicapped along with the overweight, the elderly and the less attractive.) Spade's talents are wasted as the only single member of the old team - he serves as an extra bikini ogler, insult producer, and the character of the group who often reminds the others how much fun they had back when they were WASTED.I strongly hope that the next time EVERYBODY is WASTED - no one suggests ""hey... let's make a movie!""",2,If you're stuck on a plane and this cues up - read a book instead!,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,4122,"['Grown', 'Ups', 'co-written', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'directed', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'Happy', 'Gilmore', 'Big', 'Daddy', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'enjoyable', 'few', 'cast', 'crew', 'make', 'more', 'painful', 'prostate', 'exam', 'watch.Sandler', 'joins', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'David', 'Spade', '30', 'years', 'later', 'version', 'team', '12', 'year', 'olds', 'who', 'won', 'only', 'basketball', 'championship', 'EVER', 'beloved', 'coach', 'who', 'learn', 'just', 'died', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'reassemble', 'funeral', 'Sandler', 'character', 'self-conscious', 'fact', 'successful', 'Hollywood', 'Agent', 'married', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'successful', 'designer', 'who', 'have', 'show', 'Milan', 'obnoxious', 'kids', 'rest', 'team', 'have', 'grown', 'up', 'be', 'flavor', 'loser', 'capital', 'L.There', 'genre', 'film', 'would', 'call', 'brainless', 'teenager', 'summer', 'sex', 'comedy', 'are', 'staple', 'multiplexes', 'year', 'beginning', 'spring', 'break', 'Sandler', 'company', 'apparently', 'got', 'idea', 'what', 'made', 'one', 'where', 'characters', 'were', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'watched', 'film', 'wondering', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'development', 'there', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'legitimate', 'opportunity', 'someone', 'charge', 'say', 'know', 'what', 'REALLY', 'bad', 'idea', 'movie', 'then', 'stop', 'making', 'movie.The', 'characters', 'meet', 'coach', 'funeral', 'opening', 'sequence', 'where', 'characters', 'told', 'death', 'one', 'painful', 'moment', 'Then', 'learn', 'Sandler', 'rented', 'cabin', 'same', 'one', 'where', 'team', 'celebrated', 'championship', '30', 'years', 'earlier', 'Twenty', 'so', 'people', 'pile', 'cabin', 'Hey', ""'ve"", 'got', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'David', 'Spade', 'etc', 'here', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'just', 'turn', 'camera', 'record', 'trying', 'crack', 'other', 'up', 'script', 'functions', 'little', 'more', 'opportunity', 'characters', 'be', 'extremely', 'rude', 'other', 'Schneider', 'character', 'married', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', '75', 'years', 'old', 'rather', 'celebrate', 'possibility', 'geriatric', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'involved', 'loving', 'relationship', 'instead', 'wise', 'opportunity', 'express', 'grossed-outness', 'would', 'SERIOUSLY', 'know', 'how', 'Ms.', 'Van', 'Patten', 'felt', 'working', 'film', 'scenes', 'begin', 'pile', 'up', 'stating', 'various', 'inappropriate', 'insulting', 'ways', 'old', 'women', 'are', 'GRO-dy', 'Schneider', 'also', 'three', 'estranged', 'daughters', 'who', 'randomly', 'choose', 'weekend', 'randomly', 'end', 'estrangement', 'last', 'one', 'meet', 'looks', 'chip', 'ol', 'block', 'Schneider', 'character', 'long', 'stream', 'insults', 'one', 'point', 'described', 'looking', 'dirty', 'Q-tip', 'first', 'two', 'daughters', 'are', 'swimsuit', 'models', 'other', 'guys', '1', 'opportunity', 'other', 'characters', 'insult', 'Schneider', 'how', 'did', 'come', 'THAT', '2', 'chance', 'inappropriately', 'ogle', 'scantily', 'dressed', 'daughters', 'who', 'spend', 'rest', 'movie', 'bent', 'open', 'car', 'hoods', 'up', 'ladders.A', 'word', 'filmmakers', '75', 'year', 'old', 'person', 'loving', 'relationship', 'not', 'NEARLY', 'as', 'grody', '45', 'year', 'old', 'men', 'leering', 'teenagers.Rock', 'character', 'emasculated', 'house-husband', 'pregnant', 'bread-winner', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'family', 'inclusion', 'film', 'be', 'allow', 'opportunities', 'fart', 'jokes', 'involving', 'Ebony', 'Jo-Ann', 'Rudolph', 'mother', 'including', 'blaming', 'dog', 'James', 'married', 'breast-feeding', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'pretty', 'much', 'substance', 'excreted', 'man', 'woman', 'not', 'introduced', 'cringe-worthy', 'lowest-common-denominator', 'attempt', 'evoke', 'laughter', 'James', 'butt', 'multiple', 'fat', 'jokes', 'working', 'script', 'wonder', 'considered', 'making', 'fun', 'religions', 'handicapped', 'overweight', 'elderly', 'less', 'attractive', 'Spade', 'talents', 'are', 'wasted', 'only', 'single', 'member', 'old', 'team', 'extra', 'bikini', 'ogler', 'insult', 'producer', 'character', 'group', 'who', 'often', 'others', 'how', 'much', 'fun', 'had', 'back', 'when', 'were', 'WASTED.I', 'strongly', 'hope', 'next', 'time', 'EVERYBODY', 'WASTED', 'one', 'hey', 'let', 'make', 'movie']",N/A

1303849,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG97TW,Mark Turner,"[3, 4]","One thing can be said of the movies Adam Sandler has made since leaving SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE. They've all been funny and offered some decent laughs without going to far over in being offensive. That being said, there are always those borderline moments and in GROWN UPS they all seem to revolve around breast feeding.GROWN UPS is the story of a group of friends who won a basketball championship 30 years ago. Having grown up (and apart) they are reunited for the funeral of their beloved coach. As each responds to the phone call, we are introduced to who they are now.Sandler is a hot shot agent in Hollywood married to Salma Hayek and with three children, two spoiled brat boys and a precious little girl. Kevin James is married to Maria Bello and has two children, a brat girl and a 4 year old boy who still breast feeds (don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything for you if you've seen the trailer). Chris Rock is married to Maya Rudolph and has taken on the role of underappreciated home maker to her bread winner position. Fortunately he has two normal children but also an obnoxious mother in law. Rob Schneider had fulfilled his fantasies of being with an older woman and is married to Joyce Van Patten, very much his senior. Both of them are into the whole new age style of living. And rounding out the group is David Spade, the loner of the bunch, the perennial bachelor who seems to be happy but is the one missing out more than any other.Gathering for the funeral old relationships return as the group razzes each other, teasing and picking on the weakest link even though there is a genuine affection between them all. Once the funeral itself is concluded, they all gather at the cottage where they had their victory dinner to spend the weekend together.But its not the same as it once was. Where they had fun and found so much to do at the cabin 30 years prior, their children are bored. Filled with a life of video games and instant gratification for their wants, these children have no imagination, no spark. But their fathers make the decision to show them that they can have a good time outside or just being with friends.It's slow going but the kids gradually come around. Face it, once the premise was established you knew that they would. And as they realize there is more to life than the creature comforts they've become used to, the kids actually have fun as do the adults. Trips to the water park, basketball at the cabin and paper cup phones offer them all a good time.But there's a question still in play. The big game that cemented their bond had one kid who claimed that Sandler was standing on the line when he made his last shot and that they didn't truly win. And now after all these years, that grown up (played by Colin Quinn) wants revenge and challenges them to a rematch. At first reluctant to do so, they finally take on the challenge at the big Fourth of July celebration. Who wins? Watch and see.Like most of Sandler's films in the past, the comedy is sporadic but always offers some decent laughs. Sadly some of the best ones were visible in the trailer for this film and that was so heavily promoted that I doubt anyone reading this didn't see it at least once or twice prior to the film being released. But there are enough other yucks to make this movie a fun watch and will elicit more than a few chuckles before the final scene.The film feels like a reunion of sorts for a number of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE vets as well as the characters. Along for the ride is James (one of Sandler's real life best friends) who holds his own with this group. The comedic timing and styles developed on that show are seen throughout here as each member is given his own unique role in the story.Amazingly enough, not one of the group takes center stage here and that's a good thing. The story is about a group of kids grown up, not a single one above all the rest. The focus stays on that theme throughout.Is the movie an Oscar contender? No way. Is it going to be the one movie all of these actors are remembered for? Doubtful. But it is a movie that will entertain and hold your interest from beginning to end without sitting there holding you finger poised over the fast forward button. It's light, it's fluffy and it delivers everything you'd expect from an Adam Sandler movie. Definitely worth a rental and in the end, perhaps even one that you'll want to add to your collection.",4,ADULTHOOD AND MATURITY DON'T MIX,1289260800,"11 9, 2010",2010,4407,"['One', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'movies', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'made', 'leaving', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', ""'ve"", 'been', 'funny', 'offered', 'decent', 'laughs', 'going', 'far', 'over', 'being', 'offensive', 'being', 'said', 'are', 'always', 'borderline', 'moments', 'GROWN', 'UPS', 'seem', 'revolve', 'breast', 'feeding.GROWN', 'UPS', 'story', 'group', 'friends', 'who', 'won', 'basketball', 'championship', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'apart', 'are', 'reunited', 'funeral', 'beloved', 'coach', 'phone', 'call', 'are', 'introduced', 'who', 'are', 'hot', 'shot', 'agent', 'Hollywood', 'married', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'three', 'children', 'two', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'boys', 'precious', 'little', 'girl', 'Kevin', 'James', 'married', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'two', 'children', 'brat', 'girl', '4', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'who', 'still', 'breast', 'feeds', 'do', ""n't"", 'worry', ""'m"", 'not', 'spoiling', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'trailer', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'married', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'taken', 'role', 'underappreciated', 'home', 'maker', 'bread', 'winner', 'position', 'Fortunately', 'two', 'normal', 'children', 'also', 'obnoxious', 'mother', 'law', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'had', 'fulfilled', 'fantasies', 'being', 'older', 'woman', 'married', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patten', 'very', 'much', 'senior', 'are', 'whole', 'new', 'age', 'style', 'living', 'rounding', 'out', 'group', 'David', 'Spade', 'loner', 'bunch', 'perennial', 'bachelor', 'who', 'be', 'happy', 'one', 'missing', 'more', 'other.Gathering', 'funeral', 'old', 'relationships', 'return', 'group', 'other', 'teasing', 'picking', 'weakest', 'link', 'even', 'genuine', 'affection', 'funeral', 'concluded', 'gather', 'cottage', 'where', 'had', 'victory', 'dinner', 'spend', 'weekend', 'together.But', 'not', 'same', 'once', 'was', 'Where', 'had', 'fun', 'found', 'so', 'much', 'do', 'cabin', '30', 'years', 'prior', 'children', 'are', 'bored', 'Filled', 'life', 'video', 'games', 'instant', 'gratification', 'children', 'have', 'imagination', 'spark', 'fathers', 'make', 'decision', 'show', 'can', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'just', 'being', 'friends.It', 'slow', 'going', 'kids', 'gradually', 'come', 'around', 'Face', 'once', 'premise', 'was', 'established', 'knew', 'would', 'realize', 'more', 'life', 'creature', ""'ve"", 'become', 'used', 'kids', 'actually', 'have', 'fun', 'do', 'adults', 'Trips', 'water', 'park', 'basketball', 'cabin', 'paper', 'cup', 'phones', 'offer', 'good', 'time.But', 'question', 'still', 'play', 'big', 'game', 'cemented', 'bond', 'had', 'one', 'kid', 'who', 'claimed', 'Sandler', 'was', 'standing', 'line', 'when', 'made', 'last', 'shot', 'did', ""n't"", 'truly', 'win', 'now', 'years', 'grown', 'up', 'played', 'Colin', 'Quinn', 'revenge', 'rematch', 'first', 'reluctant', 'do', 'so', 'finally', 'take', 'challenge', 'big', 'Fourth', 'July', 'celebration', 'Who', 'Watch', 'see.Like', 'most', 'Sandler', 'films', 'past', 'comedy', 'sporadic', 'always', 'decent', 'laughs', 'Sadly', 'best', 'ones', 'were', 'visible', 'trailer', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'heavily', 'promoted', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'reading', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'least', 'once', 'twice', 'prior', 'film', 'being', 'released', 'are', 'enough', 'other', 'yucks', 'make', 'movie', 'fun', 'watch', 'will', 'elicit', 'more', 'few', 'chuckles', 'final', 'scene.The', 'film', 'feels', 'reunion', 'sorts', 'number', 'SATURDAY', 'NIGHT', 'LIVE', 'vets', 'as', 'well', 'characters', 'ride', 'James', 'one', 'Sandler', 'real', 'life', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'own', 'group', 'comedic', 'timing', 'styles', 'developed', 'show', 'are', 'seen', 'here', 'member', 'given', 'own', 'unique', 'role', 'story.Amazingly', 'enough', 'not', 'one', 'group', 'center', 'stage', 'here', 'good', 'thing', 'story', 'group', 'kids', 'grown', 'up', 'not', 'single', 'one', 'rest', 'focus', 'theme', 'throughout.Is', 'movie', 'Oscar', 'contender', 'way', 'going', 'be', 'one', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'remembered', 'Doubtful', 'movie', 'will', 'entertain', 'hold', 'interest', 'beginning', 'end', 'sitting', 'there', 'holding', 'finger', 'poised', 'fast', 'forward', 'button', 'light', 'fluffy', 'everything', ""'d"", 'expect', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movie', 'Definitely', 'rental', 'end', 'perhaps', 'even', 'one', ""'ll"", 'want', 'add', 'collection']",N/A

1303851,A1DIM53U2RHG4W,B002ZG97TW,Matt Z.,"[0, 1]","I'm no fan of Adam Sandler movies... they're bland and childish most of the time, and usually devoid of wit.BUT(!) this film was a pleasant surprise. The cast was pretty much culled from the best era of Saturday Night Live (the mid 90's) and the humor is based upon life and its experiences. A rusty start kicked into a film with some meaning, substance and as the other positive reviewers have mentioned, the film takes a few jabs at the differences between today and ""yesteryear"" when children actually PLAYED and weren't subjects of militarized training games boosting them to drive for a ""kill count""One favorite was the video game which revolved around the players ability to murder and dismember people on a cruise ship. As silly as it sounds, i was thinking SARCASTICALLY when i was younger how much worse things could get, and much like a bitter cult classic from the 80's CLASS OF 1984, which at the time was a product of exaggeration, these days the film seems tame and to in fact REFLECT real life. I used to think sarcastically the same way about pop music. As things get dumber and dumber year by year and pop stars talk about abuse and cheating as if there's anything beneficial about it, it was refreshing to know that THE SPIRIT hadn't died in some people and that someone could make a funny film about life without going for the cheap shocks.The chemistry of the actors was great (of course its SNL alumni sans Kevin James) and well, i was greatly surprised by this film for the simple fact that it was a HAPPY MADISON production and (get this) I actually loved it.  (never thought i'd say that)The one breast milk on Maya Rudolphs face was kinda a cheap shocker, but the rest played off well, the quips and small talk made this film. The banters and jokes among friends (in the film) had some cerebral wit, and thats hard to find these days. YES, even the obligatory gross out scenes with Rob Schneider were played as character roles, so this was nothing as bad as DEUCE BIGALOW. Oh and predictably, Schneider's character's ""young daughters"" (smoking hot models) were worthy of the rental price alone. Yowzer. ISay what you will, i felt the need to post this review after renting the film. It was fun and surprisingly ""clean"" with a message: GET BACK TO THE FINER THINGS.Though it has a pretty bad amazon rating, I'd probably track a copy down and keep it in my collection for another rainy day, or just a movie night.

But ""Tyler Perry's Why Did I Get Married?"" was original and avoided the deliberate use of profanity that spoiled Grown Ups. Like ""Funny People"", Sandler appeared to have gathered his fellow actors in a last minute deal making to rush this comedy out for the 4th of July. Each actor got a job. Sandler satisfied his narcissistic grandiose of being the only hot shot in Hollywood. In Funny People and Grown Ups, Sandler comes across as if he was the one and only legendary actor Hollywood ever produced.How many middle school kids would ever have memory for their coach? Even high school kids lack such loyal attachments to their mentors. In celebrating the memory of their beloved middle school coach, each school mate brought his immediate relatives, Sandler's character poked his mate in his rear end, dumped him in the closet while drunk and asleep. Assuming that a Hollywood star would be such a deranged person, with no sense on how life could be endangered by such childish act, yet the clip was ill fitting, taking into consideration the high stakes of promoting the careers of the many participants in the movie.Whatever the reason for getting together to make a social comedy, Old Dogs and Grown Ups were inflicted by imitation, using known and boring faces of actors, and seeking cheep laughter at the expense of alienating many decent people from going the movie theatre.Adam Sandler playing a wealthy and famous Hollywood star, the same role in Funny People, somehow retained his sense of what normal people look like, unhappy about his spoiled kids, yet has no problem of slapping his friend over the face, over and over, and performing childish gestures, with the camera lowered to capture his finger's motion.  The viewers laughed. That might even amount to greater contempt than to the expression of approval.Getting even by grown ups over cheating in the middle school, after 30 years, sounded artificial.

The potty humor really has no business in this film because it is a little too perverted and sick for you to watch with your 5 year old, but too corny to watch with your friends.

This includes Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider, along with a number of other SNL alumni.  It's too bad the studio got an actor and comedian as talented as Blake Clark to play the basketball coach.  His character's death being the focal point of this film's plot means we actually got to see very little of him in person, but he thankfully left an impact on the project, brief as his on-screen appearance was.  I was also a bit disappointed to see Rob Schneider taking on the sometimes-used Sandler ""joke"" of bedding much older women...could have done without that.  But overall, the cast was great, satirizing American families from multiple different social circles as they all spend a weekend at a lake house together.  Many jokes used against the actors' past characters came up (i.e. Kevin James's weight), but it was all in good fun.  Sure, some aspects were corny, but the film came together as one of the better projects for many of its cast members.

It's definitely one to see if you want some laughs, but as for intelligence or plot, this film is lacking. This movie relies so much on making rude, crass and taboo remarks that it forgets about clever comedy. It is still a very entertaining movie but some of the unrealistic violence is a little bit and seems like a desperate pull for comedic relief, when it really just left me cringing. I think everything in this film focuses so much on getting people to laugh that there isn't really any true focus on plot or character development. However, I was entertained and think the cinematography was well done.I have two favorite scenes, and although they are both short, they still make me chuckle just thinking about them. The first scene is when Eric, played by Kevin James, goes to a car wash with his wife expecting to have scantily clad cheerleaders scrub his car. Instead he ends up getting male cheerleaders in ill-fitting short-shorts sudsing up his windshield. It's so hilarious because the cheerleaders are the well-known comedic music group ""The Lonely Island"" and the things they so are hilarious. Another scene that made my sides hurt from laughing is when Lenny and his friends go to their old high school hangout  and have a run in with a group of frat boys. It is so hilarious because Taylor Lautner plays the head frat boy and he does such a comedic job of playing a total numb skull that is overprotective of his turf. The boys do this ridiculous handshake and it's so perfectly cheesy and stereotypical that it makes me crack up just thinking about it.I recommend this film for ages 13+ because of the rude humor and heavy sexual innuendoes. I give this film 3.5 out of 5 stars because it is funny and entertaining, but I wouldn't rush to see it again and it lacks intelligent comedy and wit. Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film CriticI was holding my breath waiting for this film to come out ever since I heard about it. I anticipated that I would laugh a lot and love ""Grown Ups 2"" just as much as the first Grown Ups! This movie would make you laugh your head off, and say ""awww"" a lot.When I started watching this film, I thought this is probably not as funny as the first one, or not as good. Adam Sandler once again proved me wrong against all odds! The sequel is better than the original, which is very rare for movies. This funny story begins when it's a few years after the first ""Grown Ups"" when Lenny (Adam Sandler!) took his family and his friends back to his home town. The guys learned from their mistakes, hopefully, and everybody has moved on from what happened a few years ago and everybody is happy once again. During the course of the movie, they get themselves into a number of awkward and funny situations, but one of them leads to a bigger issue that makes a bunch of college students really mad. Even that doesn't stop this amazing group of friends. When Lenny hosts a party, he puts his daughter Becky to bed, (Alexys Nycole Sanchez) and then the fun happens. The college students are under the false impression that Lenny and his crew wrecked their dorm, so they are seeking revenge. That was actually not Lenny's fault at all! If you want to find out what happens to the college students and how much trouble the guys get into you have to watch the movie!I absolutely love this movie! It's funny, like every Adam Sandler movie ever made. It's a good story line with a number of heartwarming moments where you can truly see and appreciate how much these families love each other and their friends. What's also cool is this is Happy Madison's first sequel as well! The movie has adult and kid jokes (mostly adult), which is a very good perk for a funny movie. So, teens will really like it, but adults...well adults, you are going to LOVE it. I can promise that you haven't had a laugh like this in a long time...I have to say my favorite scene is when Marcus is inside a huge tire. Lenny is supposed to stop the wheel after like five feet but he gets a call and decides that is more important. Marcus just keeps rolling and rolling and rolling.

1303887,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B002ZG97TW,Roland E. Zwick,"[11, 13]","***1/2When it comes to mainstream Hollywood comedies, we've all too often found that the quality of a cast is in inverse proportion to the quality of the film (i.e., ""He's Just Not That Into You""). That being the case, I had expected ""Grown Ups"" - which features the likes of Adam Sandler, Salma Hayek, Kevin James, Maria Bello, Chris Rock, Maya Rudolph, David Spade and Steve Buscemi in starring roles - to be a real cinematic turkey. Imagine my shock, then, when the movie turned out to be, for the most part at least (and we'll get to the qualifiers in a moment), a surprisingly genial, laid-back and likable movie that generates a decent number of laughs without breaking too much of a sweat.That is a particularly noteworthy achievement given that Sandler, not exactly known for either subtlety or restraint, is not only the star of the film but co-author of the screenplay as well (along with Fred Wolf). But somehow Sandler and company (the movie was directed by Dennis Dugan) have avoided the material-given temptation of going overly-broad with the humor, choosing instead to effectively downplay things most of the way.Sandler plays Lenny Feder, a hotshot Hollywood agent with a fashion designer wife (Hayek) and two children, who spends a weekend in the country with a group of his basketball-playing chums and their families when the boys' beloved coach from thirty years ago passes away. The guys were all part of a championship team in 1978, and they've come together to honor the man who led them through the winning season, as well as to catch up with what each of them has been doing in the interim.""Grown Ups"" is far from a perfect comedy. For every sharply humorous insight it offers about the responsibility that comes with maturity, there's a crass joke or gross-out sight-gag to counterbalance it. It's almost as if the writers just couldn't help themselves, as if it were a part of their authorial DNA.That being said, there's much to like about this movie, particularly the performances and the sweetness it conveys when it's NOT being juvenile and crass.",3,uneven but with more positives than negatives,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",2011,2079,"['***1/2When', 'mainstream', 'Hollywood', 'comedies', ""'ve"", 'too', 'often', 'found', 'quality', 'cast', 'inverse', 'proportion', 'quality', 'film', 'i.e.', 'Just', 'Not', 'Into', 'being', 'case', 'had', 'expected', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'likes', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'David', 'Spade', 'Steve', 'Buscemi', 'starring', 'roles', 'be', 'real', 'cinematic', 'turkey', 'Imagine', 'shock', 'then', 'when', 'movie', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'most', 'part', 'least', ""'ll"", 'get', 'qualifiers', 'moment', 'surprisingly', 'genial', 'laid-back', 'likable', 'movie', 'decent', 'number', 'laughs', 'breaking', 'too', 'much', 'sweat.That', 'particularly', 'noteworthy', 'achievement', 'given', 'Sandler', 'not', 'exactly', 'known', 'subtlety', 'restraint', 'not', 'only', 'star', 'film', 'co-author', 'screenplay', 'as', 'well', 'Fred', 'Wolf', 'somehow', 'Sandler', 'company', 'movie', 'was', 'directed', 'Dennis', 'Dugan', 'have', 'avoided', 'material-given', 'temptation', 'going', 'overly-broad', 'humor', 'choosing', 'instead', 'effectively', 'downplay', 'things', 'most', 'way.Sandler', 'Lenny', 'Feder', 'hotshot', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'fashion', 'designer', 'wife', 'Hayek', 'two', 'children', 'who', 'weekend', 'country', 'group', 'basketball-playing', 'chums', 'families', 'when', 'boys', 'beloved', 'coach', 'thirty', 'years', 'ago', 'away', 'guys', 'were', 'part', 'championship', 'team', '1978', ""'ve"", 'come', 'together', 'honor', 'man', 'who', 'led', 'winning', 'season', 'as', 'well', 'catch', 'up', 'what', 'been', 'doing', 'interim', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'far', 'perfect', 'comedy', 'sharply', 'humorous', 'insight', 'responsibility', 'maturity', 'crass', 'joke', 'gross-out', 'sight-gag', 'counterbalance', 'almost', 'writers', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'were', 'part', 'authorial', 'DNA.That', 'being', 'said', 'much', 'like', 'movie', 'particularly', 'performances', 'sweetness', 'when', 'NOT', 'being', 'juvenile', 'crass']",N/A
1303888,A117KO8Q1KAEMY,B002ZG97TW,"Roren Tarubetto ""Roren""","[0, 0]","A tale of 5 childhood friends who reunite at the funeral of their beloved Basketball coach.For me, Adam Sandler can be hit or miss.  Only a few of his jokes reach me, and the others are ho-hum.  Not so much with this film.  I laughed the whole way through.  Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and David Spade made movie comedy magic in their depiction of 5 men with 5 very different lives.The film opens up to mini versions of our stars playing a championship game of basketball.  It is here where we get to see the individual personalities of our five stars: confident Lenny (Adam Sandler), burly bruiser Eric (Kevin James), wimpy Kurt (Chris Rock), womanizer , or in the case of this scene, girlanizer Marcus (David Spade) and Rob (Rob Schneider) who has a more mature taste in women.  Fast forward 30 years to see our guys as, you guessed it, Grownups - complete with families (and problems) of their own. Now a successful movie agent, Lenny's son's are a couple of snobs, Kurt is a house-husband and under constant scrutiny from his wife and mother-in-law, Eric has overindulged his family and Rob is in hi s 3rd marriage.  Marcus, well Marcus is still a womanizer.  The guys come together again because of the passing of Coach Buzzer and hilarity ensues.I love the way guy friends greet each other - the razzing and 1-ups.  You almost feel bad but it's way too funny to care.  And guess what? What was funny in the preview is STILL funny in the movie.  Take the pool scene (with the blue dye), there is just no way for anyone to get themselves out of the situation - I mean what would you say if it were you in that situation?!?!  Oh The Horror! The Amusement park segment was full of these kinds of moments and the ladies got in on the fun too. In a scene involving a hunky water-parker, the ladies show off their assets and get a unexpected surprise.  Salma Hayek and Maria Bello were more butts of jokes, whereas Maya Rudolph got her comedy on with a few good practical jokes (side note: is she always pregnant in every movie she stars in?).Naturally, there are lessons learned and characters redeemed.  Take Salma's uber-busy fashion designer character choosing family over work for once as an example. But really that all takes a back seat to the jokes and antics of our 5 friends.  Maybe it's because I spent a lot of time with my brothers and their friends growing up that the juvenile, nonsensical situations Adam Sandler concocted were understandable. Also, the inclusion of Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider and Kevin James in this film takes the focus off of Adam, which I believe to be a very good thing, given my beginning statement.  Special shout-out to Kevin James who is hysterical simply when standing still.I say see it, especially with a pack of your best friends.  Overly compassionate folks may be uncomfortable, but anyone else with a healthy sense of humor should have a great time with this silly, but fun movie.",4,Bwah hahahaha,1297036800,"02 7, 2011",2011,2965,"['tale', '5', 'childhood', 'friends', 'who', 'reunite', 'funeral', 'beloved', 'Basketball', 'coach.For', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'can', 'be', 'hit', 'miss', 'Only', 'few', 'jokes', 'reach', 'others', 'are', 'ho-hum', 'Not', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'laughed', 'whole', 'way', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Kevin', 'James', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'David', 'Spade', 'made', 'movie', 'comedy', 'magic', 'depiction', '5', 'men', '5', 'very', 'different', 'lives.The', 'film', 'up', 'mini', 'versions', 'stars', 'playing', 'championship', 'game', 'basketball', 'here', 'where', 'get', 'see', 'individual', 'personalities', 'five', 'stars', 'confident', 'Lenny', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'burly', 'bruiser', 'Eric', 'Kevin', 'James', 'wimpy', 'Kurt', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'womanizer', 'case', 'scene', 'girlanizer', 'Marcus', 'David', 'Spade', 'Rob', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'who', 'more', 'mature', 'taste', 'women', 'Fast', 'forward', '30', 'years', 'see', 'guys', 'guessed', 'Grownups', 'complete', 'families', 'problems', 'own', 'Now', 'successful', 'movie', 'agent', 'Lenny', 'son', 'are', 'couple', 'snobs', 'Kurt', 'house-husband', 'constant', 'scrutiny', 'wife', 'mother-in-law', 'Eric', 'overindulged', 'family', 'Rob', 'hi', 's', '3rd', 'marriage', 'Marcus', 'well', 'Marcus', 'still', 'womanizer', 'guys', 'come', 'together', 'again', 'passing', 'Coach', 'Buzzer', 'hilarity', 'ensues.I', 'way', 'guy', 'greet', 'other', 'razzing', '1-ups', 'almost', 'feel', 'bad', 'way', 'too', 'funny', 'care', 'guess', 'what', 'What', 'was', 'funny', 'preview', 'STILL', 'funny', 'movie', 'Take', 'pool', 'scene', 'blue', 'dye', 'just', 'way', 'anyone', 'get', 'situation', 'mean', 'what', 'would', 'say', 'were', 'situation', 'Horror', 'Amusement', 'park', 'segment', 'was', 'full', 'kinds', 'moments', 'ladies', 'got', 'fun', 'too', 'scene', 'involving', 'hunky', 'water-parker', 'ladies', 'show', 'off', 'assets', 'get', 'unexpected', 'surprise', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'Maria', 'Bello', 'were', 'more', 'butts', 'jokes', 'whereas', 'Maya', 'Rudolph', 'got', 'comedy', 'few', 'good', 'practical', 'jokes', 'side', 'note', 'always', 'pregnant', 'movie', '.Naturally', 'are', 'lessons', 'learned', 'characters', 'redeemed', 'Take', 'Salma', 'uber-busy', 'fashion', 'designer', 'character', 'choosing', 'family', 'work', 'once', 'example', 'really', 'back', 'seat', 'jokes', 'antics', '5', 'friends', 'Maybe', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'brothers', 'friends', 'growing', 'up', 'juvenile', 'nonsensical', 'situations', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'concocted', 'were', 'understandable', 'Also', 'inclusion', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'David', 'Spade', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'Kevin', 'James', 'film', 'focus', 'Adam', 'believe', 'be', 'very', 'good', 'thing', 'given', 'beginning', 'statement', 'Special', 'shout-out', 'Kevin', 'James', 'who', 'hysterical', 'simply', 'when', 'standing', 'still.I', 'say', 'see', 'especially', 'pack', 'best', 'friends', 'Overly', 'compassionate', 'folks', 'may', 'be', 'uncomfortable', 'anyone', 'else', 'healthy', 'sense', 'humor', 'should', 'have', 'great', 'time', 'silly', 'fun', 'movie']",N/A

He is my absolute favorite comedian, but his movies always suck. I just keep trying to change my opinion, but this film was as bad as the rest. I can't blame this film entirely on Chris Rock though. Even if the film just had Adam Sandler, Kevin James, David Spade and Rob Schneider, it would still be just as terrible. The film is basically about five guys who meet at their coach's funeral and then decide to go on a weekend retreat. While they're there, they want to relive their youth and remember the good times. The plot sounds interesting, but it's the comedy that ruins the film.Lenny (played by Adam Sandler) has kids so ridiculously spoiled that it was almost painful to watch. His two sons were obsessed with technology, but that wasn't so bad. His daughter, who looked like she was maybe 8 or 9, driving his car across the lawn and being pacified blew me completely. I know this is a comedy, but no child gets off the hook THAT easily. He's semi-tired of his spoiled kids and embarrassed by his rich lifestyle, but it's not enough for me to sympathize with him.Kurt (played by Chris Rock) is an all right character, but his wife and mother-in-law drive me insane. Nobody's grandmother is this inappropriate, farting, being an instigator and openly inappropriate. It was too over the top for me. I think even Madea would tell Mama Ronzoni (played by Ebony Jo-Ann) to have a little class. His wife, Deanne (played by Maya Rudolph), just seemed awkward. I didn't see any chemistry between the two and didn't even believe they could possibly be married. They seemed more like brother and sister than husband and wife, and she was pregnant in the film. I don't think she was the right person to play that role. (I expected to think that way about Salma Hayek and Adam Sandler, but oddly, they seemed to have the most onscreen chemistry.)Eric (played by Kevin James) has a wife who breastfeeds a four year old. Marcus (played by David Spade) is the single drunk guy. Rob Hilliard (played by Rob Schneider) is in a relationship with a senior citizen who he likes to stick his tongue out at and make lewd jokes.Their characters alone were just dumb to me. There was an occasional joke I laughed at, but I can't even remember any of them now and I just left the theater about four hours ago. That was how much the jokes stood out. The humor was just too slapstick for me to get into. I got a free movie pass to see this film, but I regret using my movie pass now.

Kochel ""Sam K""","[8, 13]","Like others I was looking forward to this movie, but now I see that was like looking forward to going to North Korea because you like the snow.First(and perhaps most importantly), the movie is not funny. Sandler often puts just stupid sophomoric sex, body, and toilet humor in his movies, and this is no exception: it has all three. I let it go (or tried at least) in Zohan, but in this movie the problem is there is no other humor, and the sex, body, and toilet humor isn't funny. I don't understand how some funny guys like this, who must no some funny writers (not the current SNL ones), could produce something so horrible. So, without wasting my time more on this aspect of the movie, let me say: it's not funny. Cliches, farting, idiotic characters, and that's that.Next, the biggest problem with this movie is it's not sentimental, but seems to think it is. The characters are poorly developed. There is a coach that seems shallow and there no moments to really build up anything touching about his relationships with the players. There is a bunch of flawed and shallow characters that we're suppose to like that seem so poorly written that I don't care about them either. When in the movie there is a ""touching"" moment between Chris Rock and his wife, how I am I suppose to find it touching when 1) he is a wimpy underdeveloped character, and she's shallow, and an idiot. This goes on with all the characters, in that none of their marriages seem to have an ounce of reality to themNext, Rob Schneider, he's so worthless. I liked ""Big Stan"" in many ways, but he's just Sandler's friend that gets to be in all these movies with him (more on that soon), and he's horrible. His character is just for shock value and is just ridiculous without being beneficial to the story.And that's my last complaint: I am sick of Sandler using the same cast as the same characters over and over, it's becoming like o.k. just waiting for Steve Buscemi to show up and be something stupid and so on...There is really only 2 things that make this movie worth watching: 1) Salma Haynek, and 2)Madison Riley.Really bad movie.p.s.

This is not always a bad thing. Most of Sandler's comedies, such as BILLY MADISON, HAPPY GILMORE, and THE WEDDING SINGER, have their own unique blend of surrealism and all out goofiness. They can be fun to watch, provided you are in the appropriate mood.In 2002, Sandler surprised both critics and audiences alike when he starred in P.T. Anderson's indie dramedy, entitled PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE. In my opinion, it was the best film of his career, and one of the finest pictures of the decade. This was an Adam Sandler that we had never seen before. The depth and complexity of this particular performance was Oscar-worthy.This would not be the last time that he would try his hand at drama. Last year's Judd Apatow film, entitled FUNNY PEOPLE, featured a risky performance from Sandler as well. As with PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, he managed to alienate his core audience, and as a result the film managed to fail at the box office - which brings me to his latest ""film"", GROWN UPS.After the death of their childhood basketball coach, five friends reunite at their favorite lake house with their wives and children. They discuss the old days, play pranks on one another, and make several unsuccessful attempts to get their spoiled, PS2 obsessed children to play outside. A fine example of the latter occurs when Adam Sandler's character watches in anticipation as his son - a brat who bosses the maid around, and prefers Evian water to tap - stands in front of a murky lake holding a rock. Will he skip it, or will he go inside and play Grand Theft Auto? Such as are the questions which arise from this tender scene.The film is full of such moments as the one mentioned above, moments which reek of false profundity.  Just in case you were worried, friendships are renewed, and life lessons learned. The world of GROWN UPS spins round and round on it's happy, manipulative, mainstream axis. The intended audience for this film should walk out pleased with the results, not to mention the lack of originality. If you were hoping for another breakthrough performance from Sandler, you'll be sorely disappointed. Even for a typical Sandler comedy, this is pathetic. At least his earlier films were fun to sit through. GROWN UPS is a terrible bore.The direction from Dennis Dugan is mediocre, as always. I believe this is his hundredth Sandler vehicle to date. The cast, which includes - in no particular order - Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph - all lend a hand in this atrocity. At least two of them should be ashamed of themselves.If you want to see Adam Sandler at his best, check out some of his earlier comedies. If you are in for a delightfully challenging film, see PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE.

I must admit, up front, that I am a die hard Adam Sandler fan, a fan of SNL on all levels (yes even the bad years) and with a cast like this (rob scneider, Chris Rock, Keven Smith, David Spade and Sandler... cmon! How can you go wrong with this? If you go into it expecting a new form of media or something revolutionary you will be very DISAPOINTED!!! But then again, I didn't walk into Happy Gilmore or the Water Boy expecting high brow humor.  IT IS WHAT IT IS PEOPLE!!!If you go into it expecting a funny movie with some laugh out loud moments this is perfect for you. Take Chris Rock for one... He is a stay at home father who gets all the traditional ""mom"" kind of comments from his wife who is the breadwinner and his live in mother who constantly berates him for being a wimp and completely unmasculine.  This works beautifully and gives you a new look at one of the funniest actors and stand up comedians of out time. Funny stuff.. ""is it that time of the month?""That is just one of the threads that makes this movie funny. Yes they are grown up and yes this movie is more for the whole family than a college dorm room but it is hillarious. Kevin Smith is the lovable overweight guy that gets the weight jokes and his wife is breastfeading their ""48 month old""  too funny!  Don't drain her!There are just moments that any parent can relate to and will laugh at.Rob Schneider is my favorite here though... Talk about funny..  His hair alone and the dynamic between him and his elderly wife who he dodes over are priceless. The 3 daughters...The point of this is to say that after watching this movie I am reminding myself of some of the better scenes at work today and finding myself laughing.  Maybe I'm crazy but isn't that the point of a movie like this?Do yourself a favor if you like any of the characters to any extent and give this a view. It's not sophmoric like some of the other films from these actors and will be a great intro for those that are too young to have seen Billy Maddison.

I like a good comedy and Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider are well respected and talented actors in their own way. I read many negative reviews about Grown Ups but the cast still made me want to see it. I am disappointed? Well, yes and no because I knew it wasn't going to be all that great but at the same I am because those actors have starred in good movies and would have you expect something a little better. All that considered, the film did reasonably well at the box office. The storyline goes like this: 5 childhood friends are reunited following the death of their beloved junior high basketball coach. They then decide to spend a weekend together at a lake house together and bring their families. As the title suggest you can expect to see grown up *ahem* people enjoying their moments together, rebuilding their relationships, catching up on what's been going on all these years and be immature adults. This storyline leads to interesting and funny situations and some not-so-funny as well, it hits and misses really.I'm not saying the movie is terrible, because it's not. But it uses too many clich&eacute;s and jokes you've seen a hundred times before (farts and such); it's a little predictable as well. There are some moments that you are likely to enjoy if you are a fan of these actors, I don't get how you could like these actors and hate the movie beginning to end. If you're a fan of the cast then you might want to see it, just don't expect a great movie out of grownups.

I saw this movie in a one-third full theatre and early in the story, most of the laughter I heard in the theatre was done by the stars of the movie, laughing at their own jokes.Briefly, here are the main characters:- Adam Sandler plays Lenny Feder, a Hollywood agent with a fashion designer wife, Roxanne Chase-Feder (Salma Hayek). They have spoiled brat kids who text their needs to the nanny. Feder seems embarrassed by his success and is teased by the other guys for being wealthy and for having gone ""Hollywood."" He spends most of the movie unnecessarily trying to hide the fact that he and his wife have a nanny for their kids.- Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James) is a lawn furniture salesman who is married with kids and a dog, and is not as successful as he is trying to appear. He is the butt of a constant stream of jokes about his weight, but I'm not sure James is a large enough man to make this joke funny throughout the movie - it gets very old very quickly.- Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is an unemployed, stay-at-home dad who spends his days trying new recipes and being insulted by his wife and live-in mother-in-law.- David Spade plays Marcus Higgins, the single, girl crazy party animal who truly hasn't grown up yet.- Rob Hilliard (Rob Schneider) is a sensitive, metaphysical vegan who is teased relentlessly by the other guys because he is married to a much older woman.The group reunites when they attend their childhood basketball coach's funeral. They then decide to spend a weekend together at a lake house with all of their families. Being in close quarters and reminiscing about their coach forces the friends to examine their own lives and relationships with their families. Feder is particularly upset with the realization that his children are so out of touch from normal childhood experiences. His sons are ridiculously spoiled and irritating and their behavior really comes to light when they spend time at the lake.The other guys also have issues to work though, from McKenzie's relationship with his wife and treatment from his mother-in-law to Hilliard's regret over how he has treated his daughters.  In the end, there are many admissions, confessions, and vows to be better - from the guys and even some of their wives.There were some funny bits and laugh-out-loud moments. One particularly funny scene is the ""One, two, three... switch!"" scene (you'll understand that if you see it).  Another is the competition they play where someone shoots an arrow straight up in the air to see who runs away first as the arrow comes down. The looks on their faces as they run are priceless.  Although the movie did get better as it went along and they at least tried to convey some positive messages about relationships and families, with this many comedians, I expected way more laughs. The concept was good, but the script just wasn't strong enough. I suspect there was a lot of ad-libbing going on among the actor/comedians.I've actually seen reviews where people gave this movie four stars out of five and it makes me wonder how they determined that rating. Even if you are only using other Adam Sandler movies as comparisons, this is not even close to the best in his repertoire.Reign Over Me (Widescreen Edition),The Wedding Singer, andSpanglishand so many others are way better than this movie.The soundtrack was pretty good:Grown Ups: Original Motion Picture SoundtrackThose of you who were around in the 80's will recognize most of the songs played throughout the movie, including ""Goodnight Tonight"" by Paul McCartney, ""The Party's Over"" by Journey, and ""Two Tickets to Paradise"" by Eddie Money.",2,"Nice try, but should be funnier with this many comedians",1278115200,"07 3, 2010",2010,3731,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'previews', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'then', 'have', 'already', 'seen', 'many', 'good', 'gags', 'movie', 'saw', 'movie', 'one-third', 'full', 'theatre', 'early', 'story', 'most', 'laughter', 'heard', 'theatre', 'was', 'done', 'stars', 'movie', 'laughing', 'own', 'jokes.Briefly', 'here', 'are', 'main', 'characters', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'Lenny', 'Feder', 'Hollywood', 'agent', 'fashion', 'designer', 'wife', 'Roxanne', 'Chase-Feder', 'Salma', 'Hayek', 'have', 'spoiled', 'brat', 'kids', 'who', 'text', 'needs', 'nanny', 'Feder', 'embarrassed', 'success', 'teased', 'other', 'guys', 'being', 'wealthy', 'having', 'gone', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'movie', 'unnecessarily', 'trying', 'hide', 'fact', 'wife', 'have', 'nanny', 'kids.-', 'Eric', 'Lamonsoff', 'Kevin', 'James', 'lawn', 'furniture', 'salesman', 'who', 'married', 'kids', 'dog', 'not', 'as', 'successful', 'trying', 'appear', 'butt', 'constant', 'stream', 'jokes', 'weight', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'James', 'large', 'enough', 'man', 'make', 'joke', 'movie', 'very', 'old', 'very', 'quickly.-', 'Kurt', 'McKenzie', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'unemployed', 'stay-at-home', 'dad', 'who', 'days', 'trying', 'new', 'recipes', 'being', 'insulted', 'wife', 'live-in', 'mother-in-law.-', 'David', 'Spade', 'Marcus', 'Higgins', 'single', 'girl', 'crazy', 'party', 'animal', 'who', 'truly', ""n't"", 'grown', 'up', 'yet.-', 'Rob', 'Hilliard', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'sensitive', 'metaphysical', 'vegan', 'who', 'teased', 'relentlessly', 'other', 'guys', 'married', 'much', 'older', 'woman.The', 'group', 'when', 'attend', 'childhood', 'basketball', 'coach', 'funeral', 'then', 'decide', 'spend', 'weekend', 'together', 'lake', 'house', 'families', 'Being', 'close', 'quarters', 'reminiscing', 'coach', 'friends', 'examine', 'own', 'lives', 'relationships', 'families', 'Feder', 'particularly', 'upset', 'realization', 'children', 'are', 'so', 'touch', 'normal', 'childhood', 'experiences', 'sons', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'spoiled', 'irritating', 'behavior', 'really', 'light', 'when', 'spend', 'time', 'lake.The', 'other', 'guys', 'also', 'have', 'issues', 'work', 'though', 'McKenzie', 'relationship', 'wife', 'treatment', 'mother-in-law', 'Hilliard', 'regret', 'how', 'treated', 'daughters', 'end', 'are', 'many', 'admissions', 'confessions', 'vows', 'be', 'better', 'guys', 'even', 'were', 'funny', 'bits', 'laugh-out-loud', 'moments', 'One', 'particularly', 'funny', 'scene', 'One', 'two', 'three', 'switch', 'scene', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'see', 'competition', 'play', 'where', 'someone', 'shoots', 'arrow', 'straight', 'up', 'air', 'see', 'who', 'away', 'first', 'arrow', 'down', 'looks', 'run', 'are', 'priceless', 'movie', 'did', 'get', 'better', 'went', 'along', 'least', 'tried', 'convey', 'positive', 'messages', 'relationships', 'families', 'many', 'comedians', 'expected', 'way', 'more', 'laughs', 'concept', 'was', 'good', 'script', 'just', 'was', ""n't"", 'strong', 'enough', 'suspect', 'was', 'lot', 'ad-libbing', 'going', 'actor/comedians.I', ""'ve"", 'actually', 'seen', 'reviews', 'where', 'people', 'gave', 'movie', 'four', 'five', 'wonder', 'how', 'determined', 'rating', 'Even', 'are', 'only', 'using', 'other', 'Adam', 'Sandler', 'movies', 'comparisons', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'best', 'repertoire.Reign', 'Me', 'Widescreen', 'Edition', 'Wedding', 'Singer', 'andSpanglishand', 'so', 'many', 'others', 'are', 'way', 'better', 'movie.The', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'Grown', 'Ups', 'Original', 'Motion', 'Picture', 'SoundtrackThose', 'who', 'were', 'around', '80', 'will', 'recognize', 'most', 'songs', 'played', 'movie', 'including', 'Goodnight', 'Tonight', 'Paul', 'McCartney', 'Party', 'Over', 'Journey', 'Two', 'Tickets', 'Paradise', 'Eddie', 'Money']",N/A

Sure there is little to no plot other than five guys getting back together after 30 years to remember there fallen basketball coach, and get there families together for a weekend at a lake house but who cares. Adam sandler is his usual Billy Madison self and still looks like a college kid even though he's 43, he cracks off his usual dry humor but steps aside a bit for everyone else to get laughs. Kevin James definitely stills the show here will his thrills spills sense of humor and big teddy bear guy personality. The movie is less of a movie and more of a series of funny moments, which is usually what all SNL movies are, one giant skit. What makes this movie work on all levels though is that it seems to be scripted very little, every (actor) comedian acts as though he or she is just being themselves instead of reading dry cardboard humor off of some cue card, this i like, and it comes natural with all these guys. Critics hate these films because its not a Ghost Writer, Atonement, or The Notebook type film that really draws you in and gets you so enthralled you can't get out, or have tears at the end. Well i love those films but this movie is NOT meant for that, its meant to make people laugh and thats exactly what it does. Chris Rock is really the only weak link, i have never liked him as a comedian or actor, he's usually loud, annoying and just not funny at all, well nothing has changed. He is put on the back burner for this very reason i believe. Slama Heyak is her usual beautiful self and the older lady (Joyce Van Patton) plays Rob Schneider's old lady has great moments as well. Rob's character is a very boring, melodramatic, serious type guy who is always down on himself which is an odd person for Schneider to play, but it works. So the overall lesson other than getting there rival team to have a basketball match at the end, is just to be a kid no matter what age, and also to teach there kids to be kids and have a good time. In the end no lesson is really learned and there is no real emotion, but the point is made and there are a lot of good moments where the kids have a lot of fun. But its called Grown ups, so its more about them than anything. I've never had all the family members and friends laugh so hard in there life, like every few minutes, this make get old to some and seem overkill, but ask yourself, do you hate laughing till tears? I doubt it. So watch it and don't listen to critics who always knock these films, enjoy!",5,"Funny if its such a bad film, everyone i know lol'ed more than i've ever seen!",1280620800,"08 1, 2010",2010,2615,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'movie', '3', 'times', 'about', '9', 'different', 'people', 'single', 'person', 'thought', 'was', 'most', 'hilarious', 'movie', 'have', 'seen', 'Sure', 'little', 'plot', 'other', 'five', 'guys', 'getting', 'back', 'together', '30', 'years', 'remember', 'fallen', 'basketball', 'coach', 'get', 'families', 'together', 'weekend', 'lake', 'house', 'who', 'Adam', 'sandler', 'usual', 'Billy', 'Madison', 'self', 'still', 'college', 'kid', 'even', '43', 'usual', 'dry', 'humor', 'steps', 'aside', 'bit', 'everyone', 'else', 'get', 'laughs', 'Kevin', 'James', 'definitely', 'show', 'here', 'will', 'thrills', 'sense', 'humor', 'big', 'teddy', 'bear', 'guy', 'personality', 'movie', 'less', 'movie', 'more', 'series', 'funny', 'moments', 'usually', 'what', 'SNL', 'movies', 'are', 'one', 'giant', 'skit', 'What', 'movie', 'work', 'levels', 'be', 'scripted', 'very', 'little', 'actor', 'comedian', 'acts', 'just', 'being', 'instead', 'reading', 'dry', 'cardboard', 'humor', 'cue', 'card', 'i', 'natural', 'guys', 'Critics', 'hate', 'films', 'not', 'Ghost', 'Writer', 'Atonement', 'Notebook', 'type', 'film', 'really', 'so', 'enthralled', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'out', 'have', 'tears', 'end', 'Well', 'i', 'love', 'films', 'movie', 'NOT', 'meant', 'meant', 'make', 'people', 'thats', 'exactly', 'what', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'really', 'only', 'weak', 'link', 'i', 'have', 'never', 'liked', 'comedian', 'actor', 'usually', 'loud', 'annoying', 'just', 'not', 'funny', 'well', 'nothing', 'changed', 'put', 'back', 'burner', 'very', 'reason', 'i', 'believe', 'Slama', 'Heyak', 'usual', 'beautiful', 'self', 'older', 'lady', 'Joyce', 'Van', 'Patton', 'Rob', 'Schneider', 'old', 'lady', 'great', 'moments', 'well', 'Rob', 'character', 'very', 'boring', 'melodramatic', 'serious', 'type', 'guy', 'who', 'always', 'down', 'odd', 'person', 'Schneider', 'play', 'overall', 'lesson', 'other', 'getting', 'rival', 'team', 'have', 'basketball', 'match', 'end', 'just', 'be', 'kid', 'matter', 'what', 'age', 'also', 'teach', 'there', 'kids', 'be', 'kids', 'have', 'good', 'time', 'end', 'lesson', 'really', 'learned', 'real', 'emotion', 'point', 'made', 'are', 'lot', 'good', 'moments', 'where', 'kids', 'have', 'lot', 'fun', 'called', 'Grown', 'ups', 'more', 'anything', ""'ve"", 'never', 'had', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'so', 'hard', 'life', 'few', 'minutes', 'make', 'get', 'old', 'seem', 'overkill', 'ask', 'do', 'hate', 'laughing', 'till', 'tears', 'doubt', 'So', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'listen', 'critics', 'who', 'always', 'knock', 'films', 'enjoy']",N/A

They come across as five guys you'd believe would be best friends...they jell together and interact well.  None of the jokes were corny or forcing it down the viewers throat...some of the comments were spoken softly and tossed in almost as a side-note or possibly ad-libbed.  You have to have some intelligence to get some of the jokes, which seem to flow throughout the entire movie without ever slowing down to deliver any of the funny.Aside from being funny, it's also a feel-good movie.  It made me smile, it made me laugh.  It shows that there are good people in this world and friends and happiness are what really matters.  Slow down, enjoy life, chillax!To those that gave this a bad review, you obviously don't like movies of this genre.
