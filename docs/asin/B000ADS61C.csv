Nevertheless, the parallels betwee this movie and another De Niro picture ""The Mission"" are too strong.  OK - in ""The Bridge..."" the heroic order resisting evil Catholic worldliness is the Franciscan Order, while in ""The Mission"" it is the Jesuits.  But in both cases, the same theme develops - sinister, worldly, heirarchical Rome vs. well-intentioned, truly-Christian (probably socialist) renegade Order.Granted that in both movies, broader themes are superimposed on the superficial stories.  In that sense, both movies are about martyrdom.  But, a martyrdom for the Self, rather than for God.But all this would have been forgivable in ""The Bridge..."" if the acting had been worthwhile.  Sadly, most of the performances were sub-par.  The dialog was far from believable (whatever Lima's idiomatic conversation may have been).

926103,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000ADS61C,Grady Harp,"[49, 50]","Thorton Wilder's novel of ruminations about the quality of love and the extremes to which it can be played out is more of a philosophical meditation than a story and this is probably the reason many people feel upended by Mary McGuckian's film, a project she both adapted for the screen and directed.  If this film seems a bit on the static side there is a reason: the tale is a testimony before court by Brother Juniper (Gabriel Byrne) about his investigation into the deaths of five people when the rope bridge of San Luis Rey outside Lima, Peru collapsed.  Brother Juniper stands before the Archbishop of Peru (Robert De Niro) and the Viceroy of Peru (F. Murray Abraham) and poses the question as to whether the incident was an act of God or just a simple accident.In order to present his case he has researched the lives of the five who died (mentioning those five would ruin the suspense of the story).  We learn about The Marquesa (Kathy Bates) whose daughter has departed for Spain to marry well (the Marquesa is starving for the love of her estranged daughter); the kindhearted Abbess (Geraldine Chaplin) who gives refuge to the unwanted including identical twin men Manuel and Esteban (the mute Mark and Michael Polish) and Pepita (Adriana Dom&iacute;nguez).  We also meet Uncle Pio (Harvey Keitel) who serves as a harlequin for the court and raises Camila Villegas AKA La Perichola (Pilar L&oacute;pez de Ayala) who loves the stage and the accoutrements more than she loves Uncle Pio.  Through the kindness of the Abbess,  Pepita is loaned to the Marquesa's household as a surrogate daughter, the twins share their devotion to the court until a tragedy separates them, La Perichola is impregnated by the Viceroy and banned from the city (she raises her little boy, hiding from the world because of her post-partum smallpox disfigurement), and Uncle Pio eventually assumes responsibility of the child out of fatherly love.  Five of these people who are true to love's power cross the fateful bridge.  Brother Juniper is condemned by the Inquisition for his treason and the meaning of the story is revealed.The cast is heavy on big names and while they make the most out of the stiff script, they never really touch us the way Wilder's novel characters did.  But the trappings of the film are grand and accurately portrayed, the scenery is beautiful, and the costumes are some of the finest period costumes in many a film.  This is one of those films that requires careful concentration from the audience, a willingness to not be disturbed by the at times static proscenium stage feeling of the setting, but the rewards of understanding the message are great.  There are some fine performances here and the film is definitely worth seeing.  It is more demanding than most films - and that is just fine!

That it has been done -- and very beautifully -- is a tribute not only to the many gifted artists who contrived it, but to the producers who paid for the attempt.  Such men and women deserve medals.The film is magnificent to look at, and the actors excellent.  Some may be disenchanted by listening to these tremendously celebrated people in American POP art, with their so-famous American voices; voices which seem intrinsically wrong in an historical context, but all that can be resolved by listening to the film in Spanish.Like the character in the story, Uncle Pio, I too am strongly attracted to women's beauty -- why bother otherwise with film -- and find to my delight that Pilar Lopez de Ayala who plays La Perichola is as beautiful as legend might wish, and in the same style as the magnificent Eva Green, whom she closely resembles.Outside of that what need one say?  The Bridge is magnificently costumed and was brilliantly mounted (in Spain) which evokes the vanished magnificence of old Lima.  Interiors are astonishing, exteriors are wondrous.  The story?A man of sincere and orthodox faith attempts to use scientific methods to not only demonstrate the working of god's intent in a random, fatal accident involving many, but to justify his method.  (Relapsed Roman Catholics may struggle not to fall to their knees and tear their hair.  But...)  The story is not facile, and though it is profound, it is not difficult.  Rather, it is universal.  It is a sublime story, and all I can do here, is encourage people to plunge into the experience, and then get out of the way, quickly, before making a fool of myself.",5,Who is Mary McGuckian and can we thank her enough?,1253750400,"09 24, 2009",2009,1774,"['Well', 'director', 'wonderful', 'film', 'never', 'thought', 'be', 'able', 'see', 'Thornton', 'Wilder', 'novel', 'realized', 'adequately', 'lifetime', 'been', 'done', 'very', 'beautifully', 'tribute', 'not', 'only', 'many', 'gifted', 'artists', 'who', 'contrived', 'producers', 'who', 'paid', 'attempt', 'Such', 'men', 'women', 'deserve', 'medals.The', 'film', 'magnificent', 'look', 'actors', 'excellent', 'may', 'be', 'disenchanted', 'listening', 'tremendously', 'celebrated', 'people', 'American', 'POP', 'art', 'so-famous', 'American', 'voices', 'voices', 'seem', 'intrinsically', 'wrong', 'historical', 'context', 'can', 'be', 'resolved', 'listening', 'film', 'Spanish.Like', 'character', 'story', 'Uncle', 'Pio', 'too', 'am', 'strongly', 'attracted', 'women', 'beauty', 'why', 'bother', 'otherwise', 'film', 'find', 'delight', 'Pilar', 'Lopez', 'de', 'Ayala', 'who', 'La', 'Perichola', 'as', 'beautiful', 'legend', 'might', 'wish', 'same', 'style', 'magnificent', 'Eva', 'Green', 'whom', 'closely', 'resembles.Outside', 'what', 'need', 'one', 'say', 'Bridge', 'magnificently', 'costumed', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'mounted', 'Spain', 'vanished', 'magnificence', 'old', 'Lima', 'Interiors', 'are', 'astonishing', 'exteriors', 'are', 'wondrous', 'story', 'man', 'sincere', 'orthodox', 'faith', 'attempts', 'use', 'scientific', 'methods', 'not', 'only', 'demonstrate', 'working', 'god', 'intent', 'random', 'fatal', 'accident', 'involving', 'many', 'justify', 'method', 'Relapsed', 'Roman', 'Catholics', 'may', 'struggle', 'not', 'fall', 'knees', 'tear', 'hair', 'story', 'not', 'facile', 'profound', 'not', 'difficult', 'Rather', 'universal', 'sublime', 'story', 'can', 'do', 'here', 'encourage', 'people', 'plunge', 'experience', 'then', 'get', 'way', 'quickly', 'making', 'fool', 'myself']",The Bridge of San Luis Rey

926108,A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX,B000ADS61C,magellan,"[4, 4]","Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the quality of the video transfer or its features.This movie, based on the Pulitzer winning novel by Thornton Wilder, has its moments, and also its share of problems. I'll try to detail them here fairly enough so that you can decide if it's really for you or not.First of all, the movie's greatest strengths are the wonderful sound track, the exquisite costumes, and the very authentic looking sets and interiors. The music, with its distinctive South American flutes and pipes often getting full play in many of the scenes, perfectly sets the tone of the movie. The second major strength is the amazing period costumes and wardrobe, which seem very complete and accurate to the time. Third, the architecture and the building interiors also seem very authentic, possibly true to the Spanish colonial style itself, although I'm not an expert on this period of architecture. I would have liked to know where it was shot.Now comes the mixed part. The casting, despite the stellar cast, is very uneven, ranging from excellent to wildly miscast. John Lynch as the military captain and Geraldine Chaplin as the mother superior are both superb although they have relatively small supporting roles. Pilar Lopez de Ayala is also quite convincing in her role as the actress, La Perichole.I'm big admirers of the next three actors, but they're just not well cast in their roles. Harvey Keitel, as the uncle and go-fer for the court of the Peruvian Viceroy, is actually okay, but I think historical movies just aren't his venue. The same goes for Kathy Bates as the Marquesa. But Robert de Niro, as much as I admire his work in general, is just miscast as the Archbishop who prosecutes Gabriel Byrne's case. Byrne himself, though, is excellent in his role as father Juniper. And F. Murray Abraham is very convincing in his role, and here he has a part not that different from the role of Antonio Salieri which he played in Amadeus or the Grand Inquisitor from In the Name of the Rose. If there's anyone who can project aristocratic hauteur better than he I'd like to see it.The pacing of the movie is quite stately, although certainly not glacial, requiring some patience from the viewer. However, the movie timeline might be a source of confusion to some people, which involves the use of flashbacks, although it's actually done well here. But if you don't know the original story it could be difficult to follow, or to understand why the main characters get the coverage they do, since that's not really revealed until the very end. The movie progresses by this series of flashback-like vignettes or substories, until we reach the very final scene in the courtroom where it all finally comes together.The dialogue comes off as stilted at times but that isn't the fault of the movie since the dialog in the book was highly stylized also as per the period. The over-arching theme of the book--how love can be a two edged sword in people's lives--either transforming it for good or for evil--makes an interesting idea around which to build the story. That part at least comes off well in the movie.So there you have it--a very mixed bag of a movie with uneven casting, a complicated, possibly hard to follow story, the slow pace--but based on an interesting idea and with a strong sound track, costumes, and settings. Whether you decide to see it or not depends on how you weigh the good and bad points I discuss here.

926110,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B000ADS61C,Pork Chop,"[1, 1]","The Bridge of San Luis Rey (2004) is a film that may ward offmany viewers for two reasons, the first being the long-runningtime (over 2 hours of film) and the Spanish culture andhistorical setting of the plot and narrative which is notmainstream in USA. Conversely, the effort in the visuals and inthe acting are outstanding, and should attract many viewers.The era that is depicted (1714 Peru) is extraordinarily welldone, from the  perfectionism  and consistency in the clothesworm by the aristocracy and/ monarchy, the filming locations(city sites), and palace interiors shown are fascinating to seein between the dialog, ( that is logical and well organized.)The roster of actors here, are world-class, notably GabrielByrne, Harvey Keitel, F. Murray Abraham, Kathy Bates and SamuelLe Bihan. Fine performances are also delivered by Bobby DeNiroand Pilar L&oacute;pez de Ayala  (playing a theatre actress, aPerichola.) The performances are excellent.A strength of this movie, is its ability to transpose theaudience into another space and time, with different social,religious and economic pressures than what is the case today. Asindicated, the visuals are impeccable and a pleasure to see, inthe traditional line of cinema, with varied emotions in theacting, comprising a mix of sobriety, euphoria, anger, sadness,and so on.On the other hands, the music is discrete and appropriate. Anaspect that deserved more work, is the editing of the movie,which is on the long-side at 120 mins.Another aspect that is noticed, is the effort in the directorstaying true to the historical record or novel, but for theaudience, some aspects are not entirely understood, such as thetwin brothers who were raised unschooled in Peru, yet are madecentral to the plot, which may mystify many viewers.In sum, this movie indeed has replay value, and may stokeinterest in that era, in Peru and in its history for viewerswanting to go deeper behind the scenes.

Even when you do grasp the meaning, you never really care about any of the characters or understand what is going on in their lives.  All in all, a sloppy, uninvolving version of what should be a gripping, moving tale.  Buy a copy of the book and read that instead.

But it's all just too much. You end up suffering from surfeit - your main concern your aching feet.The photography and costumes in this movie are exquisite and you often feel as if you are indeed looking at a series of the Master's paintings. There are Vermeer moments, and many scenes that would make astonishing still lifes if you freeze the DVD action. But it is all too dense, too thick with brocade and the lives of too many bewigged characters. For the first half of the film, I felt plunged into the alien world of 18th century Peru without enough focus to orient myself. By the second half of the film, I had grasped enough of some of the characters to begin to identify with them and to feel the poignancy of their lives and deaths. But by then, it was too late. I was suffering the tourist's complaint of too much packed into too short a time - if this is Monday, it must be Lima.They gathered a truly star-studded cast for this film. Except for Kathy Bates and Geraldine Chaplain though, the actors seem a little stiff and out of their element. And in declaiming their lines, some of their words get garbled. That's fatal, because you do need to catch every word that's being said at the outset of this film in order to appreciate what is happening and how the characters are related to each other.I had read The Bridge as an assignment in high school, but didn't remember it well. This movie presents a student with the opposite of the usual student recourse. Usually, when assigned a ""classic"" to read as homework, a student can fall back on Cliff's Notes, or better yet - go see the movie. In this case, in order to get a handy take on the movie - you really have to go read the book.",3,An exhausting day for a tourist,1137628800,"01 19, 2006",2006,1833,"['movie', 'touring', 'famous', 'art', 'museum', 'go', 'painting', 'painting', 'trying', 'dutiful', 'best', 'absorb', 'greatness', 'just', 'too', 'much', 'end', 'up', 'suffering', 'surfeit', 'main', 'concern', 'aching', 'feet.The', 'photography', 'costumes', 'movie', 'are', 'exquisite', 'often', 'feel', 'are', 'indeed', 'looking', 'series', 'Master', 'paintings', 'are', 'Vermeer', 'moments', 'many', 'scenes', 'would', 'make', 'astonishing', 'still', 'freeze', 'DVD', 'action', 'too', 'dense', 'too', 'thick', 'brocade', 'lives', 'too', 'many', 'bewigged', 'characters', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'felt', 'plunged', 'alien', 'world', '18th', 'century', 'Peru', 'enough', 'focus', 'orient', 'second', 'half', 'film', 'had', 'grasped', 'enough', 'characters', 'begin', 'identify', 'feel', 'poignancy', 'lives', 'deaths', 'then', 'was', 'too', 'late', 'was', 'suffering', 'tourist', 'complaint', 'too', 'much', 'packed', 'too', 'short', 'time', 'Monday', 'must', 'be', 'Lima.They', 'gathered', 'truly', 'star-studded', 'cast', 'film', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Geraldine', 'Chaplain', 'actors', 'seem', 'little', 'stiff', 'element', 'declaiming', 'lines', 'words', 'get', 'garbled', 'fatal', 'do', 'need', 'catch', 'word', 'being', 'said', 'outset', 'film', 'order', 'appreciate', 'what', 'happening', 'how', 'characters', 'are', 'related', 'other.I', 'had', 'read', 'Bridge', 'assignment', 'high', 'school', 'did', ""n't"", 'remember', 'well', 'movie', 'student', 'opposite', 'usual', 'student', 'recourse', 'Usually', 'when', 'assigned', 'classic', 'read', 'homework', 'student', 'can', 'fall', 'back', 'Cliff', 'Notes', 'better', 'yet', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'case', 'order', 'get', 'handy', 'take', 'movie', 'really', 'have', 'go', 'read', 'book']",The Bridge of San Luis Rey

Tonight, I finished the film too. I had the same reaction to the movie that I did to the book: great sadness. I found Wilder's syntax odd, at times, awkward and a bit obtuse as if he was trying too hard to write a profound and serious novel (it is, after all, a young man's book), but, nonetheless, I found the story compelling and the characters engaging.The film, through its narration by Brother Juniper, provided the seam that stiched together the missing narrative of the book, but surprisingly, much of the character's dialog was lifted almost verbatim from the book (only the trial was fabricated by the writer/director). The film is beautiful to behold; the costumes, set, and the Spanish landscape (substituting for Peru) were quite beautiful. But what I missed was the Andes - their massiveness permeates the book and the Spanish hills make a poor substitute.For me, the conclusion of the both the book and film just don't hang together. The charges of heresy and the need to invoke the Inquisition are not forcefully argued by Wilder. I am still hard-pressed to understand why Brother Juniper was charged and, later, destroyed for trying to make sense of a random or pre-ordained tragedy.Why the film was not more successful eludes me. It is, as I said in the beginning, a mediation, an examination, of life and death, and role of God in directing both. Like ""The Mission"" (also with DeNiro), it's not a movie I'll revisit often. It, and the novel, lacked a necessary cadence to make the journey worth taking again.
