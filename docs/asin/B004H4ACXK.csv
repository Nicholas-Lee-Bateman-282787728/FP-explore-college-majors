Most movies try to get background/scenery as near to realistic as possible, this movie went the other way making everything look as fake as possible, it's actually funny. The movie itself is pretty good. The Repo Chick is really beautiful. There is no nudity, maybe one curse word and while there was no same sex action there are a few guys that at gay. A good little movie to watch with teens.",4,A Not so dumb blonde,1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,479,"['movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'give', 'laugh', 'loud', 'moments', 'was', 'still', 'entertaining', 'Most', 'movies', 'try', 'get', 'background/scenery', 'realistic', 'possible', 'movie', 'went', 'other', 'way', 'making', 'everything', 'look', 'as', 'fake', 'possible', 'actually', 'funny', 'movie', 'pretty', 'good', 'Repo', 'Chick', 'really', 'beautiful', 'nudity', 'maybe', 'one', 'curse', 'word', 'was', 'same', 'sex', 'action', 'are', 'few', 'guys', 'gay', 'good', 'little', 'movie', 'watch', 'teens']",N/A
1407972,APBRAL723MUM4,B004H4ACXK,EJon,"[1, 1]","I *really* wanted to like this movie.  In the short period from 1984 to 1987, Alex Cox gave us the Repo Man, Sid and Nancy, Straight to Hell, and Walker (yes, I even liked Walker!).  He's sort of foundered ever since, and I was hoping this might be his redemption.  I was destined to be very disappointed.First there's the filming technique.  It's done almost entirely on green screen, and then set against backgrounds mostly made of models, many of them literally model train sets.  This all seemed naggingly familiar, then hit it hit me: the great Alex Cox had ripped off Thomas the Tank Engine!  I guess this was supposed to be surreal and artsy, but it just looked cheap and stupid.  Reportedly, he did this to stay below the $200k threshold of the Screen Actors Guild. The thing is, Repo Man was filmed for $160k and (even correcting for inflation) looks about 20 times more professional than this movie.Although this isn't really a sequel, he puts in a number of the people from the original, but this mostly reminds you that they haven't worked much since.  There are also some fairly big name actors, like Patricia Arquette, Karen Black, Chloe Webb, and Miguel Sandoval, and they're completely wasted - with the arguable exception of Sandoval, who does a fairly decent job.  It shot in 10 days, using what appears to be a rough draft of a concept for a script.  It appears they also did it Ed Wood style, always using the first take.The plot is a weird mix of heavy handed social commentary and a desperate attempt to capture the quirky magic of Repo man, and it fails at both.  Because it's trying so hard, it also fall short in the ""so bad it's good"" category.Finally, the music, or lack of it.  The iconic soundtrack was the magic pixie dust that turned Repo Man into a timeless gem, and a good soundtrack could even have saved this, at least at some level. However, what little music there is is clearly designed to *remind* us of the original, without stepping on any copyrights or paying any musicians.  In the end, that was the last nail in the coffin.I suppose if you're an Alex Cox fan, you have no choice but to watch this movie, but don't say you weren't warned.",1,What happened to the once great Alex Cox?,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",2013,2181,"['*really*', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'short', 'period', '1984', '1987', 'Alex', 'Cox', 'gave', 'Repo', 'Man', 'Sid', 'Nancy', 'Straight', 'Hell', 'Walker', 'yes', 'even', 'liked', 'Walker', 'sort', 'foundered', 'ever', 'was', 'hoping', 'might', 'be', 'redemption', 'was', 'destined', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed.First', 'filming', 'technique', 'done', 'almost', 'entirely', 'green', 'screen', 'then', 'set', 'backgrounds', 'mostly', 'made', 'models', 'many', 'literally', 'model', 'train', 'sets', 'seemed', 'naggingly', 'familiar', 'then', 'hit', 'hit', 'great', 'Alex', 'Cox', 'had', 'ripped', 'off', 'Thomas', 'Tank', 'Engine', 'guess', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'surreal', 'artsy', 'just', 'looked', 'cheap', 'stupid', 'Reportedly', 'did', 'stay', '200k', 'threshold', 'Screen', 'Actors', 'Guild', 'thing', 'Repo', 'Man', 'was', 'filmed', '160k', 'even', 'correcting', 'inflation', '20', 'times', 'more', 'professional', 'movie.Although', ""n't"", 'really', 'sequel', 'number', 'people', 'original', 'mostly', 'have', ""n't"", 'worked', 'much', 'are', 'also', 'fairly', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Patricia', 'Arquette', 'Karen', 'Black', 'Chloe', 'Webb', 'Miguel', 'Sandoval', ""'re"", 'completely', 'wasted', 'arguable', 'exception', 'Sandoval', 'who', 'fairly', 'decent', 'job', 'shot', '10', 'days', 'using', 'what', 'be', 'rough', 'draft', 'concept', 'script', 'also', 'did', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'style', 'always', 'using', 'first', 'take.The', 'plot', 'weird', 'mix', 'heavy', 'handed', 'social', 'commentary', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'capture', 'quirky', 'magic', 'Repo', 'man', 'trying', 'so', 'hard', 'also', 'fall', 'short', 'so', 'bad', 'good', 'category.Finally', 'music', 'lack', 'iconic', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'magic', 'pixie', 'dust', 'turned', 'Repo', 'Man', 'timeless', 'gem', 'good', 'soundtrack', 'could', 'even', 'have', 'saved', 'least', 'level', 'However', 'what', 'little', 'music', 'clearly', 'designed', '*remind*', 'original', 'stepping', 'copyrights', 'paying', 'musicians', 'end', 'was', 'last', 'nail', 'coffin.I', 'suppose', ""'re"", 'Alex', 'Cox', 'fan', 'have', 'choice', 'watch', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'were', ""n't"", 'warned']",N/A

Its a badly written script done against green screens with crude visual effects thrown in. Even bad television has higher production values than this thing. A Paris Hilton clone has family problems. There isn't a likeable or funny character in the whole thing. About every five minutes like clockwork the film delivers a bleedingly obvious political point. Its not funny. Its not subtile. Its a director reduced to exploiting his own work (repo man) in an embarrasing way.I edge towards thinking that this was deliberately bad. That someone was going through the motions or a score was being settled or an artist was showing contempt for money-people and/or fans. Or else its to raise money for something else.The budget was low, but not that low. The talent of the cast wasn't tapped at all. Sometimes bad things can be interesting.

This strange, nihilistic, cult-classic captured the odd mood of my time. Therefore it was only natural that when I heard of this I'd seek it out and give it a look over.Unfortunately I was very disappointed.There's just not much to this movie. Filmed quickly, the script seemed to lack much in the way of mood, meaning or point. The dialogue often seems pointless and it was difficult for me to really see what it was aimed at commenting on. (Ok, there's economic problems, see, and a growing gap between the rich and poor, but, and I think this is where the film diverged a bit from Repo Man, nobody really seemed to be attached to the problem in a spiritual sense. Their actions may have resulted from the situation but their personalities did not seem to have been created in response to the setting.)All in all, a great disappointment that was 25 years in the making.

Didn't she read the script first, or could it be true that she's too stupid to read?  Because she acted so unquestionably stupid that I thought that was just natural for her character because she played ""stupid"" so well.If I had a son that acted like any of these retards in the film, I would have had that child of mine ""put down"", ""put to grass"", so to speak.Well, I had the self-forced, cerebral stem hemorrhaging patience to watch this film for about 45 minutes before I screamed ""I JUST CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE!!!"", and I darn near broke my DVD player removing this rented DVD from my disc player.This movie was totally retarded!
