The story line was very good and the acting was great too!  Plus it was a Christmas movie--so how can you go wrong!  Some of the topics covered were very serious--false accusations, an overbearing mother, empty nest syndrome and making the correct choices that are unselfish and not just for the thrill of today but mindful of future consequences of our actions.  Barbara Stanwyck did it again--she can make you cry because she is so believable in her parts.  Another one of her tear-jerkers is ""Stella Dallas""  which also deals with a mother making unselfish choices for the benefit of her child.

1095263,AMAWA346T2D3L,B000UJCAM2,"Le Stryge ""in OZ""","[1, 2]","Let me be very clear about this right from the start.This is VERY much a &#34;women's picture&#34;.Nowadays it would be called by the abominable term &#34;chick-flick&#34;.The issues, if indeed they are still even such today, are all very much those affecting women in the forties.They seem very trivial to us now and I doubt if many of them would raise so much as an eye-brow in our current sex-obsessed society. However back then there was a strong hang-over from Victorian times regarding death, the acceptable forms of mourning, dating, sexual relationships and the way women should behave.The maintenance of a &#34;reputation&#34; (a good one that is), was of prime importance to ladies and families who considered themselves &#34;proper&#34; within society.Tongues would wag, and reputations were the first victims of salacious gossip.Barbara Stanwyck is a young recent widow with two adolescent children. Her daunting Mother is a hangover from those aforementioned Victorian times, ...all black crepe, veils and jet jewellery some 25 years or so after her own husband's demise.She tries to manipulate her daughter in the &#34;correct&#34; ways of mourning but of course they seem out dated even to Stanwyck.Then there's the question of a young widow being back in the dating market and the forms that are acceptable, if at all!Sex of course being the prime concern.It seems laughable today that Stanwyck is so afraid of any physical relationship, (she's had two kids!), but that situation makes up the bulk of the story. Yes there are mentions of some other issues such as the &#34;empty nest syndrome&#34;, domineering mothers, the extent to which we allow our children to come between us and our happiness, but ultimately it's all about whether Stanwyck will &#34;do&#34; it or not.I must say her new man is remarkably patient and understanding for an army bloke!He's a self -confessed &#34;not-the-marrying-kind&#34;, and Stanwyck vacillates  for just about the whole movie, even to the extent of a melodramatic reaction when she catches sight of the bed in her man's apartment! She's reluctant to even sit on the couch! She thinks it might be &#34;a trap&#34;!For so long she won't, then finally when she will, ...HE won't! (He's no cad to take advantage of a lady's rapidly changing mind you see?)Performances are all good, with the single exception of a young girl at the beginning who you just want to slap!Even if it is just to cause her to stop her rapid-fire yabbering and draw breath before she collapses due to lack of oxygen.You will know who I mean when you hear her.Eve Arden is a standout as an understanding friend, and Lucile Watson is excellent in another of her &#34;Mother&#34; roles.George Brent provides the VERY patient male love interest.The movie tries to be a bit of a &#34;weepy&#34; towards the end with one of those departing train situations so beloved of the genre, but I was never engaged enough to tear-up, and you probably won't be either. It reads as melodrama today.Then there's the ending when &#34;good&#34; girls are rewarded by the unlikely result of their once allergic to marriage man suddenly undergoing an instant conversion and now wanting to waltz down the aisle with his girl, settle down behind the white picket fence with pipe and slippers into domestic bliss. And all because she was such a good girl and wouldn't put out?I do think it important to see movies as products of their time and this one so very much is just that.Today none of this would be of great concern with the possible exception of the empty nest syndrome.My copy came in a four pack TCM of Stanwyck movies. Others are &#34;Baby Face&#34;,  &#34;Annie Oakley&#34; and &#34;East Side, West Side&#34;.ALL the prints are truly excellent, but like many do suffer a little from the audio fading in and out.This one has been my least favourite but worth it for the performances and a glimpse of how far &#34;morality&#34; has progressed ....or loosened, depending on your viewpoint.Lucile Watson gets to say &#34;Conventions were made because there was a need for them&#34;.I'd say they were made to control people but then that's said with the gift of hindsight.Three Stars, ...well three and a half if that was possible here.",3,Much Ado About Doing It!,1398816000,"04 30, 2014",2014,4248,"['Let', 'be', 'very', 'clear', 'right', 'start.This', 'VERY', 'much', '34', 'women', 'picture', '34', '.Nowadays', 'would', 'be', 'called', 'abominable', 'term', '34', 'chick-flick', '34', '.The', 'issues', 'indeed', 'are', 'still', 'even', 'such', 'today', 'are', 'very', 'much', 'affecting', 'women', 'forties.They', 'seem', 'very', 'trivial', 'now', 'doubt', 'many', 'would', 'raise', 'so', 'much', 'eye-brow', 'current', 'sex-obsessed', 'society', 'However', 'back', 'then', 'was', 'strong', 'hang-over', 'Victorian', 'times', 'regarding', 'death', 'acceptable', 'forms', 'mourning', 'dating', 'sexual', 'relationships', 'way', 'women', 'should', 'behave.The', 'maintenance', '34', 'reputation', '34', 'good', 'one', 'was', 'prime', 'importance', 'ladies', 'families', 'who', 'considered', '34', 'proper', '34', 'society.Tongues', 'would', 'wag', 'reputations', 'were', 'first', 'victims', 'salacious', 'gossip.Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'young', 'recent', 'widow', 'two', 'adolescent', 'children', 'daunting', 'Mother', 'hangover', 'aforementioned', 'Victorian', 'times', 'black', 'crepe', 'veils', 'jet', 'jewellery', '25', 'years', 'so', 'own', 'husband', 'demise.She', 'tries', 'manipulate', 'daughter', '34', 'correct', '34', 'ways', 'mourning', 'course', 'seem', 'out', 'dated', 'even', 'Stanwyck.Then', 'question', 'young', 'widow', 'being', 'back', 'dating', 'market', 'forms', 'are', 'acceptable', 'Sex', 'course', 'being', 'prime', 'concern.It', 'laughable', 'today', 'Stanwyck', 'so', 'afraid', 'physical', 'relationship', 'had', 'two', 'kids', 'situation', 'up', 'bulk', 'story', 'are', 'mentions', 'other', 'issues', 'such', '34', 'empty', 'nest', 'syndrome', '34', 'domineering', 'mothers', 'extent', 'allow', 'children', 'come', 'happiness', 'ultimately', 'Stanwyck', 'will', '34', 'do', '34', 'not.I', 'must', 'say', 'new', 'man', 'remarkably', 'patient', 'understanding', 'army', 'bloke', 'self', '-confessed', '34', 'not-the-marrying-kind', '34', 'Stanwyck', 'vacillates', 'just', 'whole', 'movie', 'even', 'extent', 'melodramatic', 'reaction', 'when', 'sight', 'bed', 'man', 'apartment', 'reluctant', 'even', 'sit', 'couch', 'might', 'be', '34', 'trap', '34', 'so', 'long', 'wo', ""n't"", 'then', 'finally', 'when', 'will', 'HE', 'wo', ""n't"", 'cad', 'take', 'advantage', 'lady', 'rapidly', 'changing', 'mind', 'see', 'Performances', 'are', 'good', 'single', 'exception', 'young', 'girl', 'beginning', 'who', 'just', 'want', 'slap', 'Even', 'just', 'cause', 'stop', 'rapid-fire', 'yabbering', 'draw', 'breath', 'due', 'lack', 'oxygen.You', 'will', 'know', 'who', 'mean', 'when', 'hear', 'her.Eve', 'Arden', 'standout', 'understanding', 'friend', 'Lucile', 'Watson', 'excellent', '34', 'Mother', '34', 'roles.George', 'Brent', 'VERY', 'patient', 'male', 'interest.The', 'movie', 'tries', 'be', 'bit', '34', 'weepy', '34', 'towards', 'end', 'one', 'departing', 'train', 'situations', 'so', 'beloved', 'genre', 'was', 'never', 'engaged', 'enough', 'tear-up', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'either', 'melodrama', 'ending', 'when', '34', 'good', '34', 'girls', 'are', 'rewarded', 'unlikely', 'result', 'once', 'allergic', 'marriage', 'man', 'suddenly', 'undergoing', 'instant', 'conversion', 'now', 'wanting', 'waltz', 'down', 'aisle', 'girl', 'settle', 'down', 'white', 'picket', 'fence', 'pipe', 'slippers', 'domestic', 'bliss', 'was', 'such', 'good', 'girl', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'out', 'do', 'think', 'important', 'see', 'movies', 'products', 'time', 'one', 'so', 'very', 'much', 'just', 'that.Today', 'none', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'concern', 'possible', 'exception', 'empty', 'nest', 'syndrome.My', 'copy', 'came', 'four', 'pack', 'TCM', 'Stanwyck', 'movies', 'Others', 'are', '34', 'Baby', 'Face', '34', '34', 'Annie', 'Oakley', '34', '34', 'East', 'Side', 'West', 'Side', '34', 'prints', 'are', 'truly', 'excellent', 'many', 'do', 'suffer', 'little', 'audio', 'fading', 'out.This', 'one', 'been', 'least', 'favourite', 'worth', 'performances', 'glimpse', 'how', 'far', '34', 'morality', '34', 'progressed', '.or', 'loosened', 'depending', 'viewpoint.Lucile', 'Watson', 'say', '34', 'Conventions', 'were', 'made', 'was', 'need', '34', '.I', ""'d"", 'say', 'were', 'made', 'control', 'people', 'then', 'said', 'gift', 'hindsight.Three', 'Stars', 'well', 'three', 'half', 'was', 'possible', 'here']",My Reputation

1095268,A2TOU0N8XE68W4,B000UJCAM2,Simon Davis,"[6, 6]","When the name Barbara Stanwyck is mentioned many people familiar with classic films will almost automatically produce images in their mind of the perrenial ""tough woman"" best remembered out shooting cowboys in the wild west or matching wits in some tense noir melodrama. Stanwyck however had a far wider range as an actress and during her long career she took roles in many genres and played all types of characters in both comedies and drama. Here we have her in one of my all time favourite Stanwyck vehicles 1946's ""My Reputation"". At first glance the storyline of a young widow who begins ""seeing"" another man a bit too soon after the death of her husband, (according to her ""friends"" and the stuffy local community) causing all kinds of gossip  might sound like a fairly run of the mill soaper. However Barbara Stanwyck turns the story into a strong woman's role and her character of Jessica Drummond ends up being far from the victim she might have appeared to be at the film's opening dominated as she is by her very proper and straightlaced mother. Barbara manages to make her character appealing, feminine and yet with a strong backbone that carries the story. ""My Reputation"" boasts a wonderful cast including gifted Canadian character actress Lucile Watson playing Barbara's suffocating mother, George Brent in one of his typical leading man roles, the always magical Eve Arden playing one of her typical ""best friend"" roles that she did so well, and gifted child actor Scotty Beckett who appears as one of Barbara's sons who suffers due to the ""scandal"" of his mother's supposedly improper behaviour. While this film may not be as well remembered today as other Stanwyck films such as the tear jerker ""Stella Dallas"" or her Noir classic ""Double Indemnity"" it is well worth including in any collection of her films as it displays Stanwyck in a slight change of pace which she handles with her usual aplomb delivering a fine multi-layered performance in a very handsome looking film.",5,Barbara Stanwyck At Her Dramatic Best In Fine Family Drama,1256947200,"10 31, 2009",2009,1993,"['When', 'name', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'mentioned', 'many', 'people', 'familiar', 'classic', 'films', 'will', 'almost', 'automatically', 'produce', 'images', 'mind', 'perrenial', 'tough', 'woman', 'best', 'remembered', 'out', 'shooting', 'cowboys', 'wild', 'west', 'matching', 'wits', 'tense', 'noir', 'melodrama', 'Stanwyck', 'however', 'had', 'far', 'wider', 'range', 'actress', 'long', 'career', 'took', 'roles', 'many', 'genres', 'played', 'types', 'characters', 'comedies', 'drama', 'Here', 'have', 'one', 'time', 'favourite', 'Stanwyck', 'vehicles', '1946', 'Reputation', 'first', 'glance', 'storyline', 'young', 'widow', 'who', 'seeing', 'man', 'bit', 'too', 'soon', 'death', 'husband', 'according', 'friends', 'stuffy', 'local', 'community', 'causing', 'kinds', 'gossip', 'might', 'sound', 'fairly', 'run', 'mill', 'soaper', 'However', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'story', 'strong', 'woman', 'role', 'character', 'Jessica', 'Drummond', 'up', 'being', 'far', 'victim', 'might', 'have', 'appeared', 'be', 'film', 'opening', 'dominated', 'very', 'proper', 'straightlaced', 'mother', 'Barbara', 'make', 'character', 'appealing', 'feminine', 'yet', 'strong', 'backbone', 'story', 'Reputation', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'including', 'gifted', 'Canadian', 'character', 'actress', 'Lucile', 'Watson', 'playing', 'Barbara', 'suffocating', 'mother', 'George', 'Brent', 'one', 'typical', 'leading', 'man', 'roles', 'always', 'magical', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'playing', 'one', 'typical', 'best', 'friend', 'roles', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'gifted', 'child', 'actor', 'Scotty', 'Beckett', 'who', 'one', 'Barbara', 'sons', 'who', 'suffers', 'due', 'scandal', 'mother', 'supposedly', 'improper', 'behaviour', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'as', 'well', 'remembered', 'today', 'other', 'Stanwyck', 'films', 'such', 'tear', 'jerker', 'Stella', 'Dallas', 'Noir', 'classic', 'Double', 'Indemnity', 'well', 'worth', 'including', 'collection', 'films', 'Stanwyck', 'slight', 'change', 'pace', 'usual', 'aplomb', 'delivering', 'fine', 'multi-layered', 'performance', 'very', 'handsome', 'looking', 'film']",My Reputation

Her mother - played by the screens most dominant matriarch, the laudable Lucille Watson - is horrified when her daughter refuses to don the black garb of mourning, as she herself has worn continually for many years since the passing of her husband.Stanwyck is restless, doesn't believe her life at thirty is over, and accepts an invitation from her friend (Eve Arden) to join her and her husband ski-ing.It is here she meets the always pleasant George Brent -  who made a career out of playing what were essentially support roles to the great women stars of the thirties and forties. He made 12 movies with Bette Davis, who adored him, plus others with Myrna Loy, Greta Garbo, Jean Arthur, Claudette Colbert,Anne Sheridan, and a host of others.Sparks fly when Brent meets Stanwyck and although she makes it plain she doesn't have casual affairs, she falls for him and begins dating him.The gossip mongers are horrified, and there is a scene where Stanwyck takes Brent to a party so she can introduce him to her friends and quell their speculation, which has by now reached her sons ears.The dialogue is snappy and to the point, and Stanwyck, combined with Eve Arden at her sarcastic best, keep the picture from becoming turgid, weighed down with the drama.Stanwyck was one of the giants of the Golden Age of movies and she proves her worth here as she gives her best efforts yet again.",4,My Reputation - An Interesting Study of 1940's Attitudes.,1221264000,"09 13, 2008",2008,1766,"['film', 'graced', 'presence', 'Hollywood', 'great', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'look', 'My', 'Reputation', 'study', 'more', 'strait', 'jacketed', 'morals', 'forties', 'fine', 'performance', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'movie', 'just', 'short', 'becoming', 'emotional', 'pius', 'mess.Stanwyck', 'role', 'recently', 'widowed', 'woman', 'two', 'pre-teen', 'sons', 'away', 'school', 'mother', 'played', 'screens', 'most', 'dominant', 'matriarch', 'laudable', 'Lucille', 'Watson', 'horrified', 'when', 'daughter', 'don', 'black', 'garb', 'mourning', 'worn', 'continually', 'many', 'years', 'passing', 'husband.Stanwyck', 'restless', ""n't"", 'believe', 'life', 'thirty', 'invitation', 'friend', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'join', 'husband', 'ski-ing.It', 'here', 'always', 'pleasant', 'George', 'Brent', 'who', 'made', 'career', 'playing', 'were', 'essentially', 'support', 'roles', 'great', 'women', 'stars', 'thirties', 'forties', 'made', '12', 'movies', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'who', 'adored', 'others', 'Myrna', 'Loy', 'Greta', 'Garbo', 'Jean', 'Arthur', 'Claudette', 'Colbert', 'Anne', 'Sheridan', 'host', 'others.Sparks', 'fly', 'when', 'Brent', 'Stanwyck', 'plain', ""n't"", 'have', 'casual', 'affairs', 'dating', 'him.The', 'gossip', 'mongers', 'are', 'horrified', 'scene', 'where', 'Stanwyck', 'Brent', 'party', 'can', 'introduce', 'friends', 'quell', 'speculation', 'now', 'reached', 'sons', 'ears.The', 'dialogue', 'snappy', 'point', 'Stanwyck', 'combined', 'Eve', 'Arden', 'sarcastic', 'best', 'keep', 'picture', 'becoming', 'turgid', 'weighed', 'down', 'drama.Stanwyck', 'was', 'one', 'giants', 'Golden', 'Age', 'movies', 'worth', 'here', 'best', 'efforts', 'yet', 'again']",My Reputation
1095270,A1B1F6YL4KP3S6,B000UJCAM2,Tonio Gas,"[0, 3]","""My Reputation"" (1943/46, dir.: Curtis Bernhardt): Barbara Stanwyck in a typical Bette Davis melodrama. She is a young, wealthy widow with two children getting acquainted to an officer (George Brent), but society does not want to have her happy so early after her first husband's death... Stanwyck gives a beautiful, touching performance, proving that she can not only be the tough lady. The rest of the picture is quite well, but not outstanding. The end is much too moral-driven, because it is never clear why we shall accept that some of the old conventions do make sense. This film suffers from the fact that is risks comparison with the earlier ""Now, Voyager"" (starring Bette Davis), e.g. by the appearance of Gladys Cooper in a similar role. I think the not-so-happy ending in ""Now, Voyager"" is more convincing, because in ""My Reputation"", there is really no reason why our couple should not come together. Therefore, the script needs to invent what was natural and logical in ""Now, Voyager"".",4,"Not now, voyager!",1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,998,"['Reputation', '1943/46', 'dir', 'Curtis', 'Bernhardt', 'Barbara', 'Stanwyck', 'typical', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'melodrama', 'young', 'wealthy', 'widow', 'two', 'children', 'getting', 'acquainted', 'officer', 'George', 'Brent', 'society', 'not', 'want', 'have', 'happy', 'so', 'early', 'first', 'husband', 'death', 'Stanwyck', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'performance', 'proving', 'can', 'not', 'only', 'be', 'tough', 'lady', 'rest', 'picture', 'quite', 'well', 'not', 'outstanding', 'end', 'much', 'too', 'moral-driven', 'never', 'clear', 'why', 'shall', 'accept', 'old', 'conventions', 'do', 'make', 'sense', 'film', 'suffers', 'fact', 'risks', 'comparison', 'earlier', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'starring', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'e.g', 'appearance', 'Gladys', 'Cooper', 'similar', 'role', 'think', 'not-so-happy', 'ending', 'Now', 'Voyager', 'more', 'convincing', 'Reputation', 'really', 'reason', 'why', 'couple', 'should', 'not', 'come', 'together', 'Therefore', 'script', 'invent', 'what', 'was', 'natural', 'logical', 'Now', 'Voyager']",My Reputation
