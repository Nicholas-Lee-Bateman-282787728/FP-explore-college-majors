There was Snow White, and Cinderella, and they had their requisite combination of magic and ""lived happily ever after"". ""Real"" people portrayed in movies could not, somehow, be presented that way -- it just didn't ""work"".Then somewhere along the road a film called Pretty Woman figured out one way to do it with a PG13 rating, and Rob Reiner kicked it up (and down) a notch with The Princess Bride where the fairy story element became more as we remember as little children. Andre the Giant was a real giant, and who can forget Billy Crystal as the crone?So Disney took another whack at it, and the Princess Diaries came along, and the fairy story worked some more. And we loved them, and they were family fare, and we watched them with our kids!I saw Prince Charming at an unearthly early hour in Phoenix Arizona when my body was still on South Carolina time, and immediately fell in love with it. It has that same true fairy story quality about it -- a bit of cinematic froth with just enough believability to keep you drawn in to the characters.Martin Short holds the entire package together, and is utterly in his element with the opportunity to take his Canadian origins out for a run with a flawless English accent and delivery throughout. Christina Appleton may have been a bit of an also-ran ditz in Married with Children, but here she shows some delicious emotional depth that carries us beyond the fundamental froth of the plot. Bernadette Peters uses every ounce of her Broadway chops to play a jaded diva just to the edge of over playing without quite tipping over -- mastery of her craft. The young man who plays the prince is new to me, but fits the role perfectly, an expert swordsman, and clearly the director decided to take every opportunity to show that off -- smart move.Now I note that one reviewer decries some implied sexuality in the plot and presentation. May I assure one and all that no 7 year old would ever ""get"" what was ""going on"" because of the extremely (and delightfully) clever way in which this was handled. The ""bell"" scene mentioned is at once hilarious, and essential to the understanding of the character of the prince, and to the core of the plot. How I would dearly wish that Hollywood would understand that ""sex scenes"" do not require the depiction of either nudity nor sex to get the point across to adults without corrupting the minds of children.I intend to buy this DVD and keep it on hand to play for my grandchildren when they visit. It will also be available for my Bishop's children to see (I am LDS), and others who share my rather conservative feelings about film content.I consider this to be one of the most delightful and charming films I have seen in years.",5,Charming in the old fashioned way!,1099094400,"10 30, 2004",2004,2789,"['was', 'time', 'when', 'fairy', 'stories', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'told', 'Disney', 'cartoons', 'was', 'Snow', 'White', 'Cinderella', 'had', 'requisite', 'combination', 'magic', 'lived', 'happily', 'ever', 'Real', 'people', 'portrayed', 'movies', 'could', 'not', 'somehow', 'be', 'presented', 'way', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', '.Then', 'somewhere', 'road', 'film', 'called', 'Pretty', 'Woman', 'figured', 'out', 'one', 'way', 'do', 'PG13', 'rating', 'Rob', 'Reiner', 'kicked', 'up', 'down', 'notch', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'where', 'fairy', 'story', 'element', 'became', 'more', 'remember', 'little', 'children', 'Andre', 'Giant', 'was', 'real', 'giant', 'who', 'can', 'forget', 'Billy', 'Crystal', 'crone', 'So', 'Disney', 'took', 'whack', 'Princess', 'Diaries', 'came', 'along', 'fairy', 'story', 'worked', 'more', 'loved', 'were', 'family', 'fare', 'watched', 'kids', 'saw', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'unearthly', 'early', 'hour', 'Phoenix', 'Arizona', 'when', 'body', 'was', 'still', 'South', 'Carolina', 'time', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'same', 'true', 'fairy', 'story', 'quality', 'bit', 'cinematic', 'froth', 'just', 'enough', 'believability', 'keep', 'drawn', 'characters.Martin', 'Short', 'entire', 'package', 'together', 'utterly', 'element', 'opportunity', 'take', 'Canadian', 'out', 'run', 'flawless', 'English', 'accent', 'delivery', 'Christina', 'Appleton', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'also-ran', 'ditz', 'Married', 'Children', 'here', 'delicious', 'emotional', 'depth', 'fundamental', 'froth', 'plot', 'Bernadette', 'Peters', 'ounce', 'Broadway', 'chops', 'play', 'jaded', 'diva', 'just', 'edge', 'playing', 'quite', 'tipping', 'over', 'mastery', 'craft', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'prince', 'new', 'role', 'perfectly', 'expert', 'swordsman', 'clearly', 'director', 'decided', 'take', 'opportunity', 'show', 'off', 'smart', 'move.Now', 'note', 'one', 'reviewer', 'implied', 'sexuality', 'plot', 'presentation', 'May', 'assure', 'one', '7', 'year', 'old', 'would', 'ever', 'get', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'extremely', 'delightfully', 'clever', 'way', 'was', 'handled', 'bell', 'scene', 'mentioned', 'once', 'hilarious', 'essential', 'understanding', 'character', 'prince', 'core', 'plot', 'How', 'would', 'dearly', 'wish', 'Hollywood', 'would', 'understand', 'sex', 'scenes', 'do', 'not', 'require', 'depiction', 'nudity', 'sex', 'get', 'point', 'adults', 'corrupting', 'minds', 'children.I', 'intend', 'buy', 'DVD', 'keep', 'hand', 'play', 'grandchildren', 'when', 'visit', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'available', 'Bishop', 'children', 'see', 'am', 'LDS', 'others', 'who', 'share', 'rather', 'conservative', 'feelings', 'film', 'content.I', 'consider', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'delightful', 'charming', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'years']",N/A

I know I shouldn't like this movie.  It was corny, we're talking silos here, but it was still enjoyable.  I know Prince Charming started off as a cad (that was the point) but it did show his reformation thru true love.  Martin Short did his usual schtick and it was amusing in parts.  The frog years were hilarious and made the movie.  Due to his inappropriate behavior, Prince Charming and his Squire (Martin Short) were sentenced to a ""frogging.""  They were turned into frogs until Prince Charming could get a lady to kiss him.  He would then return to being a man but had to get the lady, his one true love, to marry him before the next full moon or they would be condemned to being frogs forever and ever.  Prince Charming's return to manhood was the result of a kiss by Bernadette Peters, playing an aging starlit named Margo who refused to admit her age.  Her love interest (Hamish/Billy Connelly) was a stereotypical cad so this should be easy.  But he meets Christina Applegate and things get tricky.  The whole heroine must believe the hero is from another time period has been done better (and by Applegate herself inThe Visitors) but it works.  Prince Charming must marry Bernadette Peters to remain a man but he falls in love with Christina Applegate.  We see the Prince mature and become a real man as he comes to terms with the real meaning of love.  It's a fairy tale so of course you know how it will ultimately end but getting there was fun.The movie made me laugh (those frog years were pretty funny) and although the script was not great, it was watchable.

The story begins in Medieval England in the time of kings and castles. Two neighboring kingdoms are seeking to end a long feud by marrying their son and daughter. The problem: Prince John of Anwyn (Sean Maguire) is known for his many extramarital indiscretions, and when he commits one right before his upcoming marriage to Princess Gwendolyn (Christina Applegate), Prince John and his squire Rodney (played by Martin Short) are turned into frogs (called a ""frogging,"" by a famous wizard's curse); until the prince finds true love, (by convincing a maiden to kiss him, and then to marry him), they will remain frogs for all eternity.  Fast forward to 21st century Manhattan, 500 years later: this is where the rest of the story takes place.For those of you worried about content: Prince John is quite the ladies man, sleeping with maids and wenches alike: there are a few swear words, (...)a thief attempting to steal a woman's bike; a swordfight between two men; some spells, potions, curses, and witchcraft and wizardry (although fairly mild as movies go); and a woman who attempts to seduce a young man.All in all, I was very disappointed in this newest Hallmark film.
