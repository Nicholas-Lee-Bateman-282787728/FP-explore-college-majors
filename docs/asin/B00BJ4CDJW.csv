1635101,A15P6YW0LNA8S7,B00BJ4CDJW,"Aquarius ""blackblue""","[0, 1]","Posting this review a bit late. I watched Zambezia with the whole family back when it came out at the theater. Was to post a review back then, but never came to it. Recently we saw Frozen (another homerun), which awakened the spirit to write a review on Frozen, which on it&#8217;s turn reminded me I still had to write a review on Zambezia. Felt bad I haven&#8217;t done it yet. Zambezia is too good, for me to skip me writing a review. Bit concerned if I could still write it though, being a while back, but a s I sat down to write it, it all started coming back to me. I just recalled how I felt going in the theater, during the presentation, and when we were leaving. The fact that I could recall all that, and that it came back to me, &#8220;that&#8221; on its own, is already a statement of how good I found Zambezia to be. Without further a due, here&#8217;s my review on Zambezia:Amazingly good. Wasn&#8217;t expecting it. Didn&#8217;t know what to expect, since Zambezi is not from the, well big productions like Disney, Pixar, etc. Went in with an open mind, but I think deep down I was a bit concerned (or even skeptical) to it. But left the theater very happy. This one was a &#8220;homerun&#8221;. Went to see it with wife and 2 kids (8 and 12).  We all loved it.Good catching story. Great plot. Good animations. Excellent sound and music. Great voices. Thrilling and exiting. Very entertaining and fun. Everything seemed to come together very good. I loved it.  And for the first time Samuel L. Jackosn&#8217;s voice wasn&#8217;t bothering me in an animation. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I like Samuel L. Jackson in action movies, but hearing his voice in animations is a bit disconcerting for me. I can&#8217;t seem to fit his voice with an animated character. He&#8217;s a too powerful actor, playing powerful roles in action movies, with a very recognizable voice. So I always had a hard time hearing him in an animated movie (ex. Turbo). But this time it worked 100%.It&#8217;s refreshing to once see a good animation that isn&#8217;t from Disney or Pixar. And I loved the environmental, nature theme. Great for kids and whole family.",5,Homerun !,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",2014,2150,"['Posting', 'review', 'bit', 'late', 'watched', 'Zambezia', 'whole', 'family', 'back', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theater', 'Was', 'post', 'review', 'back', 'then', 'never', 'came', 'Recently', 'saw', 'Frozen', 'homerun', 'awakened', 'spirit', 'write', 'review', 'Frozen', '8217', 'turn', 'reminded', 'still', 'had', 'write', 'review', 'Zambezia', 'Felt', 'bad', 'haven', '8217', 'done', 'yet', 'Zambezia', 'too', 'good', 'skip', 'writing', 'review', 'Bit', 'concerned', 'could', 'still', 'write', 'being', 'while', 'back', 's', 'sat', 'down', 'write', 'started', 'coming', 'back', 'just', 'recalled', 'how', 'felt', 'going', 'theater', 'presentation', 'when', 'were', 'leaving', 'fact', 'could', 'recall', 'came', 'back', '8220', '8221', 'own', 'already', 'statement', 'how', 'good', 'found', 'Zambezia', 'be', 'further', 'due', 'here', '8217', 's', 'review', 'Zambezia', 'Amazingly', 'good', 'Wasn', '8217', 'expecting', 'Didn', '8217', 'know', 'what', 'expect', 'Zambezi', 'not', 'well', 'big', 'productions', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'etc', 'Went', 'open', 'mind', 'think', 'deep', 'was', 'bit', 'concerned', 'even', 'skeptical', 'left', 'theater', 'very', 'happy', 'one', 'was', '8220', 'homerun', '8221', 'Went', 'see', 'wife', '2', 'kids', '8', '12', 'loved', 'it.Good', 'catching', 'story', 'Great', 'plot', 'Good', 'animations', 'Excellent', 'sound', 'music', 'Great', 'voices', 'Thrilling', 'exiting', 'Very', 'entertaining', 'fun', 'Everything', 'seemed', 'come', 'together', 'very', 'good', 'loved', 'first', 'time', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackosn', '8217', 's', 'voice', 'wasn', '8217', 'bothering', 'animation', 'Don', '8217', 'get', 'wrong', 'like', 'Samuel', 'L.', 'Jackson', 'action', 'movies', 'hearing', 'voice', 'animations', 'bit', 'disconcerting', 'can', '8217', 'seem', 'fit', 'voice', 'animated', 'character', '8217', 's', 'too', 'powerful', 'actor', 'playing', 'powerful', 'roles', 'action', 'movies', 'very', 'recognizable', 'voice', 'always', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'hearing', 'animated', 'movie', 'ex', 'Turbo', 'time', 'worked', '100', '%', '.It', '8217', 'refreshing', 'once', 'see', 'good', 'animation', 'isn', '8217', 'Disney', 'Pixar', 'loved', 'environmental', 'nature', 'theme', 'Great', 'kids', 'whole', 'family']",N/A
1635102,A14XW8BJGEBM91,B00BJ4CDJW,Carlos E. Velasquez,"[21, 24]","Let me just confess that I missed this one; don't even know if it hit the theaters.  It flew under my radar and, if it weren't for the Blu-ray and DVD release, I would have never known about it. And it would have been a shame, because ""Adventures in Zambezia"" rocks! This is one truly entertaining and funny animated movie for the whole family, that come to us from South Africa, of all places.The story takes place in the beautiful African landscape, where we immediately meet young Kai and his father Tendai, two intrepid falcons that are freely flying in the majestic sky of the savannas and canyons. Tendai is teaching Kai to improve his flying and hunting techniques. The father is a little angry, because his son doesn't follow instructions and is not careful enough. Once they return to their nest, they have an argument, because Kai wants to be more able to explore and see new places. Tendai leaves the nest, and leaves Kai alone for a while. It is at this time that they receive the unexpected visit of one of Tendai's old friends, who is carrying some pigeons with her. She is running away from two vultures-like birds who want to capture the pigeons. Tendai's friend tells Kai that they are on the way to Zambezia, which is the best, safe place to live, a ""paradise for birds."" Once Tendai returns to the nest, his friend leaves, because they had a disagreement - Tendai had bad memories about Zambezia. Kai, however, wants to go and see that fabulous place, and departs by himself - against his father's will -- in search of this promised land. Once he safely arrives to Zambezia, he discovers that it is indeed a great place. Furthermore, he wants to join ""The Hurricanes,"" the ""air force"" that protects Zambezia, and which is comprised of the best of the best, the strongest birds in the colony. However, Kai's visit to Zambezia coincides with Budzo's (a giant lizard) plan to conquer this paradise. At the same time, Kai will learn things about his past which will play a role in his future.""Adventures in Zambezia"" has nothing to envy from the animation made by US studios. I have read commentaries that claim that the animation is a little outdated. I don't think so. The animation and script are sound, with a story involving good versus evil, with a love story in between. And the colors and landscapes are just awesome. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed. Plus, the voices are from Hollywood actors, such as Samuel Jackson, Leonard Nimoy, Abigail Breslin, Jeff Goldblum, and others. This is as good as it gets. The Blu-ray includes four featurettes and a music video (South Africa, 2012, color, 82 min plus additional materials).Reviewed on March 18, 2013 by Eric Gonzalez for Sony Blu-ray",5,Adventures in Zambezia,1363564800,"03 18, 2013",2013,2716,"['Let', 'just', 'confess', 'missed', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'hit', 'theaters', 'flew', 'radar', 'were', ""n't"", 'Blu-ray', 'DVD', 'release', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'shame', 'Adventures', 'Zambezia', 'one', 'truly', 'entertaining', 'funny', 'animated', 'movie', 'whole', 'family', 'come', 'South', 'Africa', 'places.The', 'story', 'place', 'beautiful', 'African', 'landscape', 'where', 'immediately', 'meet', 'young', 'Kai', 'father', 'Tendai', 'two', 'intrepid', 'falcons', 'are', 'freely', 'flying', 'majestic', 'sky', 'savannas', 'canyons', 'Tendai', 'teaching', 'Kai', 'improve', 'flying', 'hunting', 'techniques', 'father', 'little', 'angry', 'son', ""n't"", 'follow', 'instructions', 'not', 'careful', 'enough', 'return', 'nest', 'have', 'argument', 'Kai', 'be', 'more', 'able', 'explore', 'see', 'new', 'places', 'Tendai', 'nest', 'Kai', 'alone', 'while', 'time', 'receive', 'unexpected', 'visit', 'one', 'Tendai', 'old', 'friends', 'who', 'carrying', 'pigeons', 'running', 'away', 'two', 'vultures-like', 'birds', 'who', 'want', 'capture', 'pigeons', 'Tendai', 'friend', 'Kai', 'are', 'way', 'Zambezia', 'best', 'safe', 'place', 'live', 'paradise', 'birds', 'Once', 'Tendai', 'returns', 'nest', 'friend', 'had', 'disagreement', 'Tendai', 'had', 'bad', 'memories', 'Zambezia', 'Kai', 'however', 'go', 'see', 'fabulous', 'place', 'departs', 'father', 'will', 'search', 'promised', 'land', 'safely', 'Zambezia', 'indeed', 'great', 'place', 'Furthermore', 'join', 'Hurricanes', 'air', 'force', 'Zambezia', 'comprised', 'best', 'best', 'strongest', 'birds', 'colony', 'However', 'Kai', 'visit', 'Zambezia', 'coincides', 'Budzo', 'giant', 'lizard', 'plan', 'conquer', 'paradise', 'same', 'time', 'Kai', 'will', 'learn', 'things', 'past', 'will', 'play', 'role', 'future', 'Adventures', 'Zambezia', 'nothing', 'envy', 'animation', 'made', 'US', 'studios', 'have', 'read', 'commentaries', 'claim', 'animation', 'little', 'outdated', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so', 'animation', 'script', 'are', 'sound', 'story', 'involving', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'love', 'story', 'colors', 'landscapes', 'are', 'just', 'awesome', 'Give', 'try', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'voices', 'are', 'Hollywood', 'actors', 'such', 'Samuel', 'Jackson', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'Abigail', 'Breslin', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'others', 'as', 'good', 'Blu-ray', 'four', 'featurettes', 'music', 'video', 'South', 'Africa', '2012', 'color', '82', 'min', 'additional', 'materials', '.Reviewed', 'March', '18', '2013', 'Eric', 'Gonzalez', 'Sony', 'Blu-ray']",N/A

Launay,"[7, 8]","Crazy birds, competent animation, and particularly a smashing South African soundtrack....this is one of the lesser known films for the whole family.  This is a movie where the story unfolds only between the animals.A young falcon (Kai) is brought up by his father bird alone in an African desert, but dreams of becoming independent and meeting friends.  His father is anxiously overprotective, wants to isolate the young bird from danger, but ultimately Kai learns that somewhere in Africa there is a ""bird oasis"" - a world where birds flock and are safe from harm.  Dad (Tendai) knows about the bird sanctuary...but has never encouraged his son to travel there or learn from the other birds.  Curious.  Bored and lonely and rebellious, Kai decides to wing it on his own to see Zambezia for himself.  Here,  the young fellow learns about his birth in Zambezia, falls in love, and struggles to prove himself worthy in the avian community.  But there are predatory birds and lizards who have other plans...for the falcon and for Zambezia itself.I reduced my score from 5 to 4 simply because the plot elements are predictable. Notwithstanding, the animation is done with panache and charm.Every once in a while, I don't want to watch ""Citizen Kane"" or some other profound, complex movie.

1635124,AHF97M45JFCB,B00BJ4CDJW,ONENEO,"[5, 8]","There's a simple reality when it comes to computer generated feature films here in the United States- and that is simply that the DVDs and BLU-RAYs finding their way onto our store shelves, into streaming servers and into the RedBox are typically derived from one of two methods:  Domestically written, produced and animated and then there are those that take the cheap way out- an American studio or distribution company picks up the rights to a foreign CG film, does their best to slap some English over the mismatched mouth flaps and passes it off as their own creation.  To date, the latter has been disastrous and for good reason.  Comedy pieces rely upon timing to deliver tight dialog.  When an English language director is forced to incorporate lines that will match up with the timing and mouth flapping of a film originally intended for a different language, catastrophe is inevitable.  No need to take my word for that- dozens upon dozens of films created using this process are released each year; Doogal, The Snurks, Dolphin the Story of a Dreamer, Legend of the Sea and so on (yes I've reviewed them all, archived here).Enter Adventures of Zambezia from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment; a film that arrived to DVD and Blu on March 26th as a part of an exclusivity deal between Sony and Wal-Mart.  Where things get really interesting is that this film doesn't precisely fall into either of the two categories of production described above.  It was written and produced and animated by (English-speaking) Triggerfish Animation Studios out of South Africa but then brought here to the United States to be completed.  As a result, rather than to record a dialog track of local actors, a fine Hollywood ensemble (including Samuel L Jackson, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nemoy, Abigail Breslin and Jeremy Suarez) was integrated right from the onset.  Additionally, audio work was done through Skywalker Sound to ensure the quality and richness of sound effects and mixing American moviegoers have come to expect.  Finally, since the film was scripted, storyboarded and animated to be in English, problems with sloppy timing, mismatched mouth flaps, and other ugliness associated with dubbing into another language are nonexistent.Technical nuances aside, you are likely reading this review to determine whether or not this film is right for a rental or purchase for you and yours and I'm pleased to report that for most, the answer is yes.  Wearing a G (general audience) rating and coming in at a runtime of 83-minutes, Adventures in Zambezia manages to pack an awful lot of heart into its reputed $20-million budget (if that sounds like a lot to you, do keep in mind that Pixar's Toy Story 3 boasted a budget ten times as large at $200-mil).The film is set within the wilds of Africa and centers on a young falcon named Kai (Jeremy Suarez) living in relative isolation with his father Tendai (Samuel L Jackson). An unexpected visitor leads Kai to learn of Zambezia, a legendary city that promises sanctuary for nearly every bird on the globe. Tendai's mysterious opposition toward the fabled city results in Kai's desire to strike out on his own in the hopes of finding Zambezia in the eventual hope of joining the Hurricanes: Zambezia's elite fighting force charged with protecting the city.Arriving to the destination is only the beginning as Kai must impress the arduous Hurricane leader Ajax (Jeff Goldblum), win over the approval of the small female firecracker Zoe (Abigail Brezlen), and discover why he never knew his mother from the wise village elder Chief Sekhuru (Leonard Nemoy).  Larger conflicts are also brewing in the form of devious Marabous (the only birds excluded from Zambezia) and an alliance they form with the evil lizard Budzo (Jim Cummings) resulting in the kidnapping of Kai's dad.Pacing is flawless right from the opening scene onward, a testament to (as one of the included featurettes attests) multiple drafting and story boarding prior to production.  Visually, the film manages to dazzle as well (especially in high-definition).  Character models are realistic but warm, textures are rich and colorful.  It may not be quite as vibrant as Blue Sky's Rio but it really isn't far behind.  Also unlike Rio, Zambezia does away with the human element entirely, instead weaving its entire tale through its English-speaking animals.Musical scoring, sound effects and vocal casting are all incredibly solid and delivered in a gorgeous 5.1 Dolby Digital mix.  Relative unknown Jeremy Suarez brings some welcome charisma to the character of Kai, Goldblum reminds through his trademarked dryness that he hasn't lost touch with his comedic genius and even Samuel L breaks away from his usual straight-man with attitude routine to bring some warmth to Tendai.A host of interesting extras also grace the home release of the film; confirming the suspicion that a labor of love fueled the film's production team up and over many of the hurdles associated with bringing a major motion picture to life.  Fortunately their efforts were rewarded with the Best South African Feature Film award at the Durban International Film Festival in 2012.  It also represents the first internationally released CG feature to come out of South Africa so its success is additionally exciting for all involved.Of course some will find fault in its lack of originality, risk-taking or Pixar/ DreamWorks level cleverness but make no mistake, such complaints fade away when the film hits all the right marks.  To compare it to past domestic releases, it contains charm reminiscent to Disney's 2005 Valiant or Warner's 2010 Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (though visually more impressive than either).In conclusion, Triggerfish's future appears quite bright on an International level with Adventures in Zambizia.  While making this release exclusive to Wal-Mart limited the marketplace options for purchase, it's looking like August will see a much more widespread release.  It is certainly a film worth picking up should you encounter it in your travels.",4,Internationally Created Treat,1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,6066,"['simple', 'reality', 'when', 'computer',
