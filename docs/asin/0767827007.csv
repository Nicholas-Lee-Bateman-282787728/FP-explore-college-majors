18385,A1UJI61C25D89G,0767827007,A Customer,"[3, 3]","The movie begins with the suicide of a government official.  Next it shows a young woman who spends time playing computer games for profit, and dines on pizza and chocolate candy.  Her life is solitary, communicating mainly thru telephone lines.  (An earlier incident in Angela's life made her withdrawn.)  A package is delivered, and she runs the enclosed diskette.  Because of the diskette's secret, great danger enters her life.The story tells how her identity can be stolen, and official records created, to make her a wanted criminal.  She survives many attempts to kill her, but her close friends do not.  All because of that diskette, whose secret is slowly revealed.The secret of the diskette is how a &quot;bug&quot; was installed into protection software to create a 'trap door' that can be used to allow a person to access any computer, and then browse, create, or modify the data.  This is NOT fiction - some software does come with defaults to allow access.  (I once heard a person boast that his former firm had a tradition of doing this.)Angela discovers that a deliberately incorrect medical diagnosis was created to induce the suicide of that government official. After escaping dangers, she succeeds in sending the information to the FBI, and the plot is uncovered.  (Did you note the resemblance of 'Jeff Gregg' to the fictional 'Will Styles'?)The movie's style and scenes reminds me of Alfred Hitchcock: an innocent on the run due to a mistaken identity, or stumbling into a secret plot.  The parade scene recalls &quot;Blowout&quot;, the ending on the catwalk recalls &quot;The Parallax View&quot;.  Some criticize this for copying, but I would call it &quot;best practices&quot;.

The story shifts to a computer game player in her home. Angela Bennett copies a file to a floppy on her Mac computer. [A coffee cup next to her keyboard?] She is told about a ""program error"" in a file. [A ""trap door""?] Later Dale flies his private airplane at night. Is there something wrong with his aircraft computer? Angela is called to fill in for Dale on short notice. There are many problems at the airport [the computer system?]. Angela basks in the sun on her vacation. She uses her laptop [at the beach?] Jack Devilin talks to her. [Is this a coincidence?] We soon learn about Jack's activities. [Is Angela too trusting?] Does she like taking risks? She talks to herself to a stranger! ""Who are you, Jack?"" But Angela knows a trick or two. She has a narrow escape. She awakes in a hospital after three days.TV news reports a Stock Market crash caused by a prank. Angela learns she has a new identity: Rutah Marx. She finds a big surprise when she returns home! What if her police records are forged? ""She kept to herself and didn't talk to anyone."" [The importance of family connections.] Angela talks to new people! She calls her doctor for help. ""This is bizarre."" ""I don't understand!"" [Was her personal information on the Internet?] What can she do now? Angela uses her old laptop to access information. Will she be monitored by someone? Angela has to leave for a meeting with ""CyberBob"". What about Allen's pills? A switched prescription? [Couldn't he identify those pills?] Angela doesn't wear a disguise to that meeting in a public place. She gets a surprise! Can Angela escape? She returns to the hospital and finds Dr. Champion has expired. Treated for diabetes? Insulin shock? Angela's car was reported stolen. Can she escape?""You have the right to remain silent."" She is interrogated, her records do not match her story. The ""Gatekeeper System"" protects the computer system of the LAPD. [Fingerprints or DNA can also be changed.] Then a lone FBI Agent shows up to release her. ""Did you make a copy of that disk?"" There is a car crash, Angela escapes again. Jeff Gregg tells about using the ""Gatekeeper System"". [He is the replacement for Bergstrom.] Angela knows how to work the system! ""Who is Praetorian""? Angela searches for the identity. Surprise! [Saving a file to a floppy dates this movie.] Can Angela find a disguise to escape? There is a candle-lit march outside. Angela goes to a convention center. Can she send a message to the FBI? Jack Devilin finds her. Can Angela outwit them? She runs to a lonely place, Jack follows her. Can Angela use a fire extinguisher? Records are wiped out. Justice catches up with Jeff Gregg. The last scenes tie up most loose ends.Was this movie just imaginative? We now know about a government agency's snooping into everything about everybody. It is only a small step to modifying these records to effect the desired  result. That suicide of a government official in a public park actually happened, although we do not know the real reason. There are rumors about building a ""trap door"" into a system, particularly when pointy-haired managers are in charge. I hope records are better protected than is shown here (hospitals, police records, etc.). Did that ""Jeff Gregg"" character resemble any real person? While this story tells about unauthorized access, it is possible that authorized people could perform these changes for official requests. Some of these scenes resemble earlier movies of suspense (""The Parallax View""). Did you recognize them?

Hm, interesting...the same Irwin Winkler who produced Rocky, Raging Bull, They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, and Goodfellas? The tag line of The Net reads as follows, ""Her driver's license. Her credit cards. Her bank accounts. Her identity... Deleted."" I wish that was Sandra Bullock's life. Who can believe that a computer geek that spends her time holed up in a house without meeting much of anyone be this pretty? That was the most implausible part of the film. It was actually better than Wargames or Hackers. The premise was interesting, but the execution of the film left me bored with its Hitchcockian technique. A lot of times, given the movie was made in 1995, I am surprised how fast the internet connection was and how fast the uploading was too. That time, we were still using dial-up modem connection...hello! SLOW! The was the second most implausible part of the film. One easiest way to prove her identity is to produce a yearbook of a school that she went to. Another is the dental records; mind you, not everything was electronically stored that time. Most companies, small or large, were still using paper records in 1995. So, that was the third most implausible part of the film.

The directing, casting, sets, and music are first class. Those of us that are in the computer industry and those who are not will both enjoy it. I'm a Senior Engineer that has worked with computers for twenty plus years and I saw it when it was first released.When I first saw this movie, only one thing amused me, the Wolfenstein game, it's the movies only shortcoming. At the time the movie was released the game was old news and they carry on about how the game is state of the art. It didn't ring true with those of us that were on the bleeding edge of the gaming community. They should not have put the game in or came up with something that looked high tech since the game dates it. Perhaps snobbery, but true nonetheless.As I said before it was the only shortcoming. This movie is excellent and the mood is like a Hitchcockian or Grisham thriller. Well paced and it keeps you guessing what's next.

18401,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0767827007,C. O. DeRiemer,"[2, 2]","I'm a sucker for Sandra Bullock, and she's the reason why this thriller of paranoid business intrigue works as well as it does. The story line is simple. Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer expert who tests software. She's a genius at what she does. One day she comes across a disc which gets her into something called The Gatekeepers. It shouldn't have done so, and before long she becomes the object of a hired killer, her best friend dies in a hospital and she's on the run with her identity stolen. She doesn't know what's going on, but in self defense she starts cracking computer codes and discovering secrets. By the end of the movie she has narrowly escaped death more than once, helped a bad guy take a dive off a catwalk, managed to break into a high security area and copy some incriminating computer files and then bring down a murderous and resourceful computer security corporation and its millionaire owner.Bullock makes Angela Bennett an intriguing, resourceful and also probably lonely woman. As Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam), an untrustworthy cad who bedded her once and then tried to kill her, says to her, ""If you would just take a step back from all of this, you'd see that you and I are really not so different. We're both loners, we're both isolated, we're both really untrusting, we're both looking for the same...clarity.""Bennett is a woman who is most comfortable having dinner by herself in front of her computers, preferably a delivered anchovy pizza and a cup of chocolate M&Ms.; Angela finds her life and identity have been taken over by another woman. She no longer has a social security number. Her credit cards are no good. Her car has been reported as stolen. Her house has been put up for sale. She even finds her medical records now say she was treated for a venereal disease. Through it all, Angela refuses to give up.Why does this unlikely scenario work so well? Because Sandra Bullock in her films comes off as smart but not smart-alecky, as good-looking but without any preening self-awareness, as a woman who'd make a great life partner but also a great best friend, as a warm, humorous woman not afraid to look disheveled or, in other of her lighter movies, slightly ridiculous at times. She's a likable actress, and one of the few who have been able to open and sustain movies by herself.The Net is an unlikely thriller, but Bullock and Northam turn it into a good ride. The older DVD edition has a slightly soft transfer and no extras. The latest edition has a better picture and a commentary.",4,Paranoid Computer Intrigue With A Winning Performance By Sandra Bullock,1139356800,"02 8, 2006",2006,2539,"[""'m"", 'sucker', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'reason', 'why', 'thriller', 'paranoid', 'business', 'intrigue', 'as', 'well', 'story', 'line', 'simple', 'Angela', 'Bennett', 'Bullock', 'computer', 'expert', 'who', 'software', 'genius', 'what', 'One', 'day', 'disc', 'something', 'called', 'Gatekeepers', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'done', 'so', 'long', 'object', 'hired', 'killer', 'best', 'friend', 'hospital', 'run', 'identity', 'stolen', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'going', 'self', 'defense', 'cracking', 'computer', 'codes', 'discovering', 'secrets', 'end', 'movie', 'narrowly', 'escaped', 'death', 'more', 'once', 'helped', 'bad', 'guy', 'take', 'dive', 'off', 'catwalk', 'managed', 'break', 'high', 'security', 'area', 'copy', 'incriminating', 'computer', 'files', 'then', 'bring', 'down', 'murderous', 'resourceful', 'computer', 'security', 'corporation', 'millionaire', 'owner.Bullock', 'Angela', 'Bennett', 'intriguing', 'resourceful', 'also', 'probably', 'lonely', 'woman', 'Jack', 'Devlin', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'untrustworthy', 'cad', 'who', 'bedded', 'once', 'then', 'tried', 'kill', 'her', 'would', 'just', 'take', 'step', 'back', ""'d"", 'see', 'are', 'really', 'not', 'so', 'different', ""'re"", 'loners', ""'re"", 'isolated', ""'re"", 'really', 'untrusting', ""'re"", 'looking', 'same', 'clarity', 'Bennett', 'woman', 'who', 'most', 'comfortable', 'having', 'dinner', 'herself', 'front', 'computers', 'preferably', 'delivered', 'anchovy', 'pizza', 'cup', 'chocolate', 'M', 'Ms', 'Angela', 'life', 'identity', 'have', 'been', 'taken', 'over', 'woman', 'no', 'longer', 'social', 'security', 'number', 'credit', 'cards', 'are', 'good', 'car', 'been', 'reported', 'stolen', 'house', 'been', 'put', 'up', 'sale', 'even', 'medical', 'records', 'now', 'say', 'was', 'treated', 'venereal', 'disease', 'Angela', 'give', 'up.Why', 'unlikely', 'scenario', 'work', 'so', 'well', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'films', 'off', 'smart', 'not', 'smart-alecky', 'good-looking', 'preening', 'self-awareness', 'woman', 'who', ""'d"", 'make', 'great', 'life', 'partner', 'also', 'great', 'best', 'friend', 'warm', 'humorous', 'woman', 'not', 'afraid', 'look', 'disheveled', 'other', 'lighter', 'movies', 'slightly', 'ridiculous', 'times', 'likable', 'actress', 'one', 'few', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'able', 'open', 'sustain', 'movies', 'herself.The', 'Net', 'unlikely', 'thriller', 'Bullock', 'Northam', 'turn', 'good', 'ride', 'older', 'DVD', 'edition', 'slightly', 'soft', 'transfer', 'extras', 'latest', 'edition', 'better', 'picture', 'commentary']",N/A

Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock), who is a systems analyst living in California, is sent a disk with some secret information on that Angela can make nothing of except that it says it's secret. A pi symbol on the corner of the screen of this program lets her access a whole lot of secret files. Her colleague, Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon), who sent it to her is killed in his light aircraft as he flies down to meet her. Bennett was on the point of going on vacation, so she continues on down to Mexico where she learns of Hessman's death. Meanwhile, she gets picked up on the beach by Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who takes her out on his boat, seduces her and then tries to kill her. One of the first difficulties that Bennett encounters is that she has her identity stolen and a new `Angela Bennett' installed in the firm for which she works. She has to assume a new identity of 'Ruth Marx' even to get back into the U.S. from Mexico. The rest of the film is then about Bennett trying to get her own identity back and get crucial information to the FBI while Devlin tries to stop her.

To have your whole life stripped away from you in one second is absolutely terrifying. The directing in The Net wasn't topnotch, but does keep you on the edge of your seat.

18439,AG8U6F6226GBZ,0767827007,Lotte,"[5, 7]","If you're into computers and you like a suspense movie, you'll probably love The Net.  It combines the two quite well and Sandra Bullock does one of her best movies imo.  In the film, she lives alone, spending most of her time fixing her company's computers on line.  She seems to rarely go out or socialize except with others by computer.  She even orders her food over the computer, and it's delivered.  Because she keeps to herself,  hardly anyone knows her personally, and her mother is in a nursing home with Alzheimer's Disease, so she doesn't remember her. Her only friend is an ex boyfriend, who happens to be a psychiatrist, and she's broken up with him.  The fact that she's so incognito has a lot to do with the film.  Before leaving for her first vacation in years, she get's a call from a friend in her company who is confused about a weird disk that's come into his possesion, and wants her to help him. Not willing to figure it out over the phone or on the computer, he tells her he needs to see her in person and he's flying to her home in LA.  He never arrives.She takes her vacation, but while at the beach she meets a hacker.  Both are lying on the beach with computers clicking away.  He seems like a nice enough guy, but beware, maybe he's not.  The real plot actually begins at this point.  From then on it's a mystery and a chase.  This hacker works for a shady crime syndicate whose trying to take over the government by hacking into their computers.She's chased all over the movie by this underground bunch, and I won't tell you the ending, but it's pretty exciting.  Bullock is really good in this one.PS  I save a lot of DVD's and this was one of them.  Re-watched this one last night, and while I have a computer (a Mac) I couldn't understand much of what I saw on the computers in this film.  First of all I rarely use discs for what I do on my computer which is for email,and to entertain myself with all the new game shows and websites you can have fun on.  But my husband and I were alone last night couldn't decide what DVD to watch.  Finally we decided to watch and old mystery.  It's 2012 now, almost 2013 next month.  So I was confused by the type of computers Bullock had. Especially all those discs.  Ordering dinner and having it delivered by computer?  The first time I watched it, ages ago, I really liked the film.  But this time, not so much. I'm no computer geek, and don't need discs for much of anything. Already the computer tells me to upgrade, and I haven't been using this latest one very long.Anyway, though I've seen the story, it still gave me a good mystery, even though it began to get weird when in one scene after another nobody, not even the police tried to check her story, except on a computer.  It would have been so easy.Angela's mother is in a home suffering from Alzheimer's Disease and doesn't know her.  But the hospital staff she's in would have had to met her to admit her and give follow ups on her condition. I know this to be true, because my mother was also in a hospital for Alzheimer's Disease. The other thing is that once she realized her identity was stolen, she went about trying to help herself in the wrong way. When she first got home and her home was for sale, and her name was changed, she tried to figure things out for herself, when instead she should have gone straight to the police and told them what happened to her on her vacation. In fact, since her name was changed before she left her hotel, she could have told them that part as well.  In fact, she should have gone to the police before going home! She must have suspected something going on after her experience with that stranger she met.  Then while trying to escape from him by boat she was in a wreck. She apparently was rescued, and and spent time in the hospital for several days.  So, that story could have been checked by telephone. Why not call police from the hospital and tell them what happened to her?  I think she would have had a much easier time of it had she gone to some of these places for help. Computers were not the only thing cops used back then.  How about a telephone call and a visit to the hospital her mother was at? The girl was pleading for help, and I for one, think they would have tried.Anyway, as the movie went on, my husband and I, having seen the film before kept coming up with ideas where she went wrong and got herself into so much trouble. Also, how can you believe that the place where she worked by computer never saw her in the flesh, never met her?  That too didn't add up.  I know people who can work at home on computers, but they have to come to work sometimes.  Apparently, this firm never saw her once.  I think if you've seen the film by DVD as I have in the past, you could come up with a lot of ideas Angela never thought of.",5,"THRILLER, SUSPENSE Flick!",1173484800,"03 10, 2007",2007,4823,"[""'re"", 'computers', 'like', 'suspense', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'love', 'Net', 'two', 'quite', 'well', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'imo', 'film', 'alone', 'spending', 'most', 'time', 'fixing', 'company', 'computers', 'line', 'rarely', 'go', 'out', 'socialize', 'others', 'computer', 'even', 'orders', 'food', 'computer', 'delivered', 'herself', 'hardly', 'anyone', 'personally', 'mother', 'nursing', 'home', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', ""n't"", 'remember', 'only', 'friend', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'be', 'psychiatrist', 'broken', 'up', 'fact', 'so', 'incognito', 'lot', 'do', 'film', 'leaving', 'first', 'vacation', 'years', 'get', 'call', 'friend', 'company', 'who', 'confused', 'weird', 'disk', 'come', 'possesion', 'help', 'Not', 'willing', 'figure', 'out', 'phone', 'computer', 'see', 'person', 'flying', 'home', 'LA', 'never', 'arrives.She', 'vacation', 'beach', 'hacker', 'are', 'lying', 'beach', 'computers', 'clicking', 'away', 'nice', 'enough', 'guy', 'beware', 'maybe', 'not', 'real', 'plot', 'actually', 'point', 'then', 'mystery', 'chase', 'hacker', 'shady', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'trying', 'take', 'over', 'government', 'hacking', 'computers.She', 'chased', 'movie', 'underground', 'bunch', 'wo', ""n't"", 'tell', 'ending', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'Bullock', 'really', 'good', 'one.PS', 'save', 'lot', 'DVD', 'was', 'one', 'Re-watched', 'one', 'last', 'night', 'have', 'computer', 'Mac', 'could', ""n't"", 'understand', 'much', 'what', 'saw', 'computers', 'film', 'First', 'rarely', 'use', 'discs', 'what', 'do', 'computer', 'email', 'entertain', 'new', 'game', 'shows', 'websites', 'can', 'have', 'fun', 'husband', 'were', 'alone', 'last', 'night', 'could', ""n't"", 'decide', 'what', 'DVD', 'watch', 'Finally', 'decided', 'watch', 'old', 'mystery', '2012', 'now', 'almost', '2013', 'next', 'month', 'was', 'confused', 'type', 'computers', 'Bullock', 'had', 'Especially', 'discs', 'Ordering', 'dinner', 'having', 'delivered', 'computer', 'first', 'time', 'watched', 'ago', 'really', 'liked', 'film', 'time', 'not', 'so', 'much', ""'m"", 'computer', 'geek', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'discs', 'much', 'anything', 'computer', 'upgrade', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'using', 'latest', 'one', 'very', 'long.Anyway', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'story', 'still', 'gave', 'good', 'mystery', 'even', 'began', 'get', 'weird', 'when', 'one', 'scene', 'nobody', 'not', 'even', 'police', 'tried', 'check', 'story', 'computer', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'easy.Angela', 'mother', 'home', 'suffering', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', ""n't"", 'know', 'hospital', 'staff', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'met', 'admit', 'give', 'follow', 'ups', 'condition', 'know', 'be', 'true', 'mother', 'was', 'also', 'hospital', 'Alzheimer', 'Disease', 'other', 'thing', 'once', 'realized', 'identity', 'was', 'stolen', 'went', 'about', 'trying', 'help', 'wrong', 'way', 'When', 'first', 'got', 'home', 'home', 'was', 'sale', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'tried', 'figure', 'things', 'out', 'herself', 'when', 'instead', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'straight', 'police', 'told', 'what', 'happened', 'vacation', 'fact', 'name', 'was', 'changed', 'left', 'hotel', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'part', 'as', 'well', 'fact', 'should', 'have', 'gone', 'police', 'going', 'home', 'must', 'have', 'suspected', 'something', 'going', 'experience', 'stranger', 'met', 'Then', 'trying', 'escape', 'boat', 'was', 'wreck', 'apparently', 'was', 'rescued', 'spent', 'time', 'hospital', 'several', 'days', 'So', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'checked', 'telephone', 'Why', 'not', 'call', 'police', 'hospital', 'tell', 'happened', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'much', 'easier', 'time', 'had', 'gone', 'places', 'help', 'Computers', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'thing', 'cops', 'used', 'back', 'then', 'How', 'telephone', 'call', 'visit', 'hospital', 'mother', 'was', 'girl', 'was', 'pleading', 'help', 'one', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'tried.Anyway', 'movie', 'went', 'husband', 'having', 'seen', 'film', 'kept', 'coming', 'up', 'ideas', 'where', 'went', 'wrong', 'got', 'so', 'much', 'trouble', 'Also', 'how', 'can', 'believe', 'place', 'where', 'worked', 'computer', 'never', 'saw', 'flesh', 'never', 'met', 'too', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'up', 'know', 'people', 'who', 'can', 'work', 'home', 'computers', 'have', 'come', 'work', 'sometimes', 'Apparently', 'firm', 'never', 'saw', 'once', 'think', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'film', 'DVD', 'have', 'past', 'could', 'come', 'up', 'lot', 'ideas', 'Angela', 'never', 'thought']",N/A

18447,A1A4BX7D2OY0D4,0767827007,Michael Garcia,"[0, 0]","I recently saw this movie for the first time since it came out.  Sandra Bullock is a computer specialist who comes across a government conspiracy.  I remember at the time the movie came in the internet was just taking off, so that became a central part of the movie.  In it you will be treated to brick cell phones, inch high computer fonts, a game of wolfenstein and much more!!  The movie interesting at times, but slow and dull at others; it plays like a film noir, but the plot is too thin to get into.Bullock's character is a prototypical computer geek in very sense, being on the computer all day and eating pizza.  She has all the characteristics the difference being shes female....and hot.  This of course poses the movie's first plot hole, how a woman this attractive would not be getting taken care of buy a decent guy, but anyways, you have to use your suspension of disbelief.  So her character is basically is a shut-in at home(much like Sigourney Weaver's character in Copycat), that is until she receives a special floppy disk in the mail.  This was in an alternate universe at a time when people only had a phone at home.She throws the disk in the computer and the mayhem begins.  A plot involving a virus called Gatekeeper and its association with the recent assassination of a politician set the movie going.  Bullock's character takes a vacation where her identity is stolen and a hired hitman sets out to retrieve the disk Bullock was sent and keep her quiet, to keep secret the truth behind the Gatekeeper.From there its fairly ABC cat and mouse.  We see Bullock try to reclaim her identity and expose the criminals.  Along the way she is aided by Dennis Miller, who provides his usual material in a comedic relief type of role you would expect from him.  The lame part of the movie is that everything revolves around computers, Sandra Bullock is into computers, the bad guys use a computer, the main bad guy has a laptop on the dash of his car, there is a part of the movie where the characters run through a computer convention(???).  Oh yeah, and Dennis Miller's character dies due to someone hacking the computer at the pharmacy and changing his prescription.The climax of the movie takes place in office building where Sandra Bullock hacks a computer to expose the bad guys.  Its sort of like the scene in the Matrix where Keannu Reeves weaves his way out of his cubicle into the real world, except in this movie its the opposite.

18448,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,0767827007,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""The Net"" was one of a spate of hacker movies released in 1995, in response to the explosion of population online after the commercialization of the internet and creation of the World Wide Web. This time, hackers are the villains, and the hero is a reclusive systems analyst. Angela Bennett (Sandra Bullock) works from her Venice, California home for a games company called Cathedral, debugging their programs. Dale (Ray McKinnon), her boss at the company's headquarters, sends Angela a game called ""Mozart's Ghost"" that seems to inadvertently create a back door to some classified government web sites. On vacation in Mexico, Angela is romanced by a handsome Brit named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam), who turns out to be after more than a roll in the hay. Suddenly, Angela no longer exists in any records, or she is someone else, and she's running for her life.""The Net""  begins with a scene inspired by the suicide of Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster in 1993. In the film, Undersecretary of Defense Michael Bergstrom (Ken Howard) kills himself in a park between the GW Parkway and the Potomac river. We don't know why until much later. The narrative requires suspension of disbelief, as thrillers often do, in that it does not seem possible that no one apart from Angela's ex-therapist could confirm her identity. There were a lot of paper records in 1995, so her enemies would not have been able to alter or erase everything. There is a nice role reversal when the tall, dark, and handsome Jack Devlin seduces the geeky, slightly awkward Angela, but this also requires suspension of disbelief. Jack is so conspicuously calculated and insincere that I don't think any woman would fall for his charade.But ""The Net"" was prescient in its presumption that so much information is stored on computers that we are all vulnerable to tampering. In this case, a group of cyberterrorists are wrecking havoc on major computer systems in the United States, and on Angela's life since she stumbled upon them, for reasons that are not clear until the film's final act. In 1995, people could probably not imagine that they would put so much information online voluntarily, on social networking and e-commerce sites, or that security holes would be so difficult to overcome. We are more in danger of identity theft from bedroom hackers than from terrorists, more knowable due to our own choices online than from government files. Nevertheless, ""The Net"" tapped into justifiable fears of these new technologies. This may have been one of the first movies to feature cell phone tracking as well.It's clever enough, but ""The Net"" fails as a thriller. It's a bit flat. The technical stuff will cause eye-rolling among anyone who knows computers, and among many who don't. The film runs a little long, at one hour and 50 minutes, because it spends so much time establishing that Angela lacks personal connections - self-employed, no boyfriend, reclusive, mother has Alzheimer's- in an attempt to make her identity problems seem plausible. It doesn't work, and the scenes feel out-of-place in a thriller. It strikes me that a lot of hacking films or ""cyberthrillers"" of the 1990s had interesting, provocative ideas and poor execution. Hollywood could not figure out how to treat this material. Between ""War Games"" in 1983 and ""The Matrix"" in 1999, there were many good ideas but no good cyberthrillers. ""The Net"" is not without entertainment value, but it's not quite good either.The DVD (Columbia/Tristar 1997): This is a 2-side disc with widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. Dubbing is available in Spanish and French. Subtitles are available in Spanish and Korean. No bonus features on the 1997 release.",3,Reasonably Entertaining. Taps Into Real Fears of the Net.

Dale instructs Angela to hold the CTRL and SHIFT buttons while clicking the  symbol, revealing that it gives the user entry point access to government and military computer systems. It is learned 'they' have recently implemented a newly developed piece of illegitimate 'protection' software called The GateKeeper System and this is what the film hinges upon.On vacation in Mexico, Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) acquaints himself with Angela under the pretense that he is just another computer hacker on vacation. He is later revealed to have been sent by a cyber-terrorist group within Cathedral Software known as the Praetorians. Jack tries to steal the computer disk she has with her that contains the program permitting entry to other computer systems, displayed in the first scenes of the film, but she escapes. Angela then learns just what the Praetorians are capable of with the GateKeeper's backdoor. When she tries to re-enter the United States, Angela discovers that her identity has been changed by the hackers who are stalking her, and she is now listed as ""Ruth Marx,"" a convicted prostitute with a string of drug offenses.Now a wanted felon, Angela goes on the run. As her life revolves almost exclusively around her work, and her mother (Diane Baker) suffers from Alzheimer's, she is unable to find anyone who can identify her. Finally, she contacts her former lover and psychiatrist (Dennis Miller), but he is also murdered as a result of the hackers' machinations.Desperate to escape the 'net,' Angela sneaks into the Cathedral office where the hacker is thought to be located. She identifies one of the hackers, the real Ruth Marx (Wendy Gazelle), now using Angela's identity, and contrives to uncover the master plan of the Praetorians, which is to install their own 'Gatekeeper' software into the mainframes of several government and military computer systems. Angela sets off the fire alarm and manages to copy all of the evidence of the hacker's plan onto a disk, just before the fake Angela makes it back to her desk.At a computer convention, she sends an e-mail to the FBI, revealing the hackers' plan. Jack and Ruth arrive at the computer station where Angela was working at. Jack hacks into the FBI mainframe and tells Angela that everything she did will be deleted by pressing the escape key. But what Jack didn't realize is that Angela inserted a disk containing a virus that will infect any system when the escape key is pressed. In doing so, he releases the virus into Cathedral's mainframe and all of the files are deleted. Angela escapes and she is chased by Jack and Ruth. Jack accidentally kills his partner and the real Angela ambushes Jack, knocking him off a catwalk and sending him to his death.Based on the evidence that she has sent the FBI, the leader of the hackers is arrested, and Angela gets her life back.",5,"IF YOU LOVE COMPUTERS, YOU WILL LOVE THIS FLICK",1237248000,"03 17, 2009",2009,3026,"['fellow', 'analyst', 'Cathedral', 'Software', 'Dale', 'Angela', 'Bennett', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'program', 'disk', 'when', 'run', 'peculiar', 'symbol', 'lower-right', 'corner', 'Dale', 'Angela', 'hold', 'CTRL', 'SHIFT', 'buttons', 'clicking', 'symbol', 'revealing', 'user', 'entry', 'point', 'access', 'government', 'military', 'computer', 'systems', 'learned', 'have', 'recently', 'implemented', 'newly', 'developed', 'piece', 'illegitimate', ""'protection"", 'software', 'called', 'GateKeeper', 'System', 'what', 'film', 'upon.On', 'vacation', 'Mexico', 'Jack', 'Devlin', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'Angela', 'pretense', 'just', 'computer', 'hacker', 'vacation', 'later', 'revealed', 'have', 'been', 'sent', 'cyber-terrorist', 'group', 'Cathedral', 'Software', 'known', 'Praetorians', 'Jack', 'steal', 'computer', 'disk', 'program', 'permitting', 'entry', 'other', 'computer', 'systems', 'displayed', 'first', 'scenes', 'film', 'Angela', 'then', 'just', 'what', 'Praetorians', 'are', 'capable', 'GateKeeper', 'backdoor', 'When', 're-enter', 'United', 'States', 'Angela', 'identity', 'been', 'changed', 'hackers', 'who', 'are', 'stalking', 'now', 'listed', 'Ruth', 'Marx', 'convicted', 'prostitute', 'string', 'drug', 'offenses.Now', 'wanted', 'felon', 'Angela', 'run', 'life', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'work', 'mother', 'Diane', 'Baker', 'suffers', 'Alzheimer', 'unable', 'find', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'identify', 'Finally', 'former', 'lover', 'psychiatrist', 'Dennis', 'Miller', 'also', 'murdered', 'result', 'hackers', 'machinations.Desperate', 'escape', ""'net"", 'Angela', 'sneaks', 'Cathedral', 'office', 'where', 'hacker', 'thought', 'be', 'located', 'one', 'hackers', 'real', 'Ruth', 'Marx', 'Wendy', 'Gazelle', 'now', 'using', 'Angela', 'identity', 'contrives', 'uncover', 'master', 'plan', 'Praetorians', 'install', 'own', ""'Gatekeeper"", 'software', 'mainframes', 'several', 'government', 'military', 'computer', 'systems', 'Angela', 'fire', 'alarm', 'manages', 'copy', 'evidence', 'hacker', 'plan', 'disk', 'just', 'fake', 'Angela', 'back', 'desk.At', 'computer', 'convention', 'e-mail', 'FBI', 'revealing', 'hackers', 'plan', 'Jack', 'Ruth', 'arrive', 'computer', 'station', 'where', 'Angela', 'was', 'working', 'Jack', 'FBI', 'mainframe', 'tells', 'Angela', 'everything', 'did', 'will', 'be', 'deleted', 'pressing', 'escape', 'key', 'what', 'Jack', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'Angela', 'inserted', 'disk', 'containing', 'virus', 'will', 'infect', 'system', 'when', 'escape', 'key', 'pressed', 'doing', 'so', 'virus', 'Cathedral', 'mainframe', 'files', 'are', 'deleted', 'Angela', 'escapes', 'chased', 'Jack', 'Ruth', 'Jack', 'accidentally', 'partner', 'real', 'Angela', 'ambushes', 'Jack', 'knocking', 'off', 'catwalk', 'sending', 'death.Based', 'evidence', 'sent', 'FBI', 'leader', 'hackers', 'arrested', 'Angela', 'life', 'back']",N/A

18459,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0767827007,Reviewer,"[2, 2]","For anyone who has ever logged on to the internet (and of course you have!) this movie will have you looking over your shoulder and seeking enrollment in a twelve step program for computer addiction.  ""The Net,"" directed by Irwin Winkler, stars Sandra Bullock as a computer nerd who has her identity-- her whole life, in fact-- snatched away from her with the stroke of a single key.  Angela Bennett (Bullock) is a computer whiz kid who works out of her home finding flaws in and debugging new programs sent to her on disc by her employer.  One day she inadvertently stumbles across one that is so big it sets off a chain reaction of intrigue that places her at the eye of the storm, though she hasn't a clue as to what it's all about.  All she knows is that suddenly she's not herself any more; at least according the records stored on hard drives everywhere.  And it's only the beginning of complications, the likes of which would give anyone with even the slightest bit of paranoia nightmares.  With a plot that would make Kafka proud, this precursor to the even more paranoia-inducing ""Enemy Of The State,"" is a dark, cautionary tale of the misuse of a  technology that has quickly encompassed virtually every walk of life, yet without anyone having first harnessed the full fury of it's potential.  A work of fiction?  Of course; one could even say ""science"" fiction.  But in this case the technology is already in place, and anyone who wants YOU badly enough need look no further than the data base of the DMV, a credit card bureau or the Post Office, and they will quickly know more about you than you know yourself.  For those who would scoff, there's an old adage that goes something like:  Anything that can be used ""for"" you can also be used ""against"" you.  At the very least it's food for thought that could keep those with opposing views on the matter debating endlessly.  Or, as in this case of this movie, it's enough to drive the average computer hacker to the brink of madness.  Shades of Lovecraft.  At any rate, Winkler has given us an engrossing film that is intense and so exasperating, as you can only sit by and watch helplessly as he puts Angela through her paces, while Bullock makes it all convincing with an excellent performance, making Angela believable as an average girl-next-door whose frame of reference doesn't go much beyond her computer screen.  And all without making her too innocent or naive; she strikes an honest chord with her character that makes her one with whom the audience can readily identify, which is one of the strengths of the movie.  She evokes such empathy that it's easy to feel what it would be like to be in her place; and through her eyes, it's not a pretty sight.  The supporting cast includes Jeremy Northam (Jack), Dennis Miller (Alan), Diane Baker (Mrs. Bennett), Wendy Gazelle (Ruth Marx) and Ken Howard (Bergstrom). Along with the dawning of a new age in technology comes the birth of a new era in fiction that will forevermore be fueled by the microchip.  And if ""The Net"" is any indication, buckle your seat belts, because it's going to be an intense, bumpy-- and highly entertaining-- ride (as already evidenced by ""The Matrix,"" as well as the aforementioned ""EOTS"").  It's inevitable that the questions of possibility or probability will arise, especially when a film like this has a contemporary setting; but the most important thing to remember is that if projects such as this fall into capable hands, we'll all be in for some exciting cinema.

18460,A2M66S05KKNSWC,0767827007,"Rivkah Maccaby ""Rivkah Maccaby""","[9, 25]","SPOILER AHEAD: Here is The Net in twenty-five words or more: The White Shadow is murdered. Cut to computer hermit girl. She finds something weird on software she is sent. Then she's on a boat in a convenient storm, then alone in foreign country sans passport, and cannot contact anyone who knows her. Her identity is stolen. She is almost killed a few times. As though there were ever a doubt, since she is played by Sandra Bullock, she is restored to home, as evidenced by her happily gardening with neighbor.I haven't seen many films that asked so much suspension of disbelief, and yet did not have at least one muppet, time machine, space ship, or magic spell. First, there's this whiny white girl, who has a six figure salary and a job where no one cares if she wears her yellow sweatpants with the hole in the knee (not that I am the slightest bit jealous, no! not me. Not once did I want to jump into the TV shouting &quot;Problems? I'll give you problems! I should have your luck! If some man offered to wipe me out of existence, I'd ask how soon can you do it!&quot;) who has barely left her house long enough in the past five years to buy a box of Cheerios, suddenly decides to pursue truth and justice across a continent.And the stolen identity. Within a few hours, some computer superpower has wiped out her identity WORLDWIDE. Puh-lese. I can see getting her membership at VideoWorld canceled, getting her electricity turned off, or even canceling her credit cards, but embassies are only as efficient as the countries in which they're located. The American embassy in Moscow couldn't even get my laundry done on time. It does no good to put supercomputers in the embassy in Kazakstan, if they will run through the Kazak phone lines. It would take months to completely disenfranchise a citizen, if it could be done without someone catching on along the way.Then there's the ending, which was such a not sequitur, I'm surprised theatre audiences weren't throwing rotten fruit and beating the screen with their canes. Here it is: hermit girl ventures out once in a quinquennia, and look how it turns out: shipwreck, stranded, stolen identity, attempts on life, etc. If that were me, I'd look at all the people who called me a crazy hermit and say &quot;See?&quot; then take up permanent residence in a bomb shelter. But not Sandra. There she is, at the end, deciding she's not getting enough human interaction, volunteering at a hospital, and making friends with the neighbors and their plants. And for no apparent reason other than the director needed an excuse for a pull-back shot. The message of this film is apparently &quot;you should always get to know your neighbors, so if you're ever shipwrecked on a resort continent without your passport, at least there's someone to water your ferns.&quot;I see that all I have done here is recited the plot for you. A review is supposed to do more than that-- but well, in this case, there wasn't really anything else to write about. Yes, Sandra Bullock is pretty, but pretty is no substitute for character development. In her defense, she may have agreed to take the role before the script was finished, so if this is a learning experience for her, then maybe some good can be salvaged from the rubble.

18475,A2491AQB89D4N5,0767827007,Willard C. Smith,"[12, 13]","The Net combines elements of techno paranoidism, action, and reverses the usual gender roles. The result is a little uneven, but still worth watching.The premise is that an isolated, but brilliant, software engineer (Angela Bennett played by Sandra Bullock) has her identity stolen, when she stumbles across a conspiracy involving trap doors in a software security system used by many federal, state, and private databases.Although stolen identities are a hot topic in today's issues, the ability to steal someone's identity is proportional to the how isolated an individual may be, and this theft is made easier because Angela's life is very isolated.  She works out of her home and communicates primarily over the telephone and internet. There are lots of people who would like to meet her, but she puts them off.The technological portion of the film that is interesting shows how a person, who depends on computerized output, can be murdered  when someone else fools with the data bases. This happens over and over, as the conspiracy attempts to isolate and kill Angela.The action part of this film involves most of the cliches common to this type of genre. We get the chase in the crowd, on the merry-go-round, in the darken street (several times), on the freeway, at the bridge crossing, on the boat, in the amusement park, and finally on the catwalk. The first couple of times are OK, but after a while it begins to get tired.Fortunately the film is saved because it reverses the usual gender roles. Like true action heros, no one suddenly appears and SAVES Angela. Everyone she tries to get help from are either killed or isolated. In the end Angela saves herself using the same wits and knowledge that made her a much sought after engineer.  She gets back her identity, exposes the conspiracy, and kills the bad guy.I like Sandra Bullock. She has the isolated awkward character down pat, but still with enough pluck to fight back. Jeremy Northam's heavy is smooth enough to stare down a cobra, and seems to have a psychopathic personality that he trieds to hold in check. He gets his relief on a keyboard.I wanted to scream at some of the technology holes in this film. The flashing terminal showing lots of overlaying screens which, I suppose, was suppose to represent the Trap Door was laughable. The way in which Angela tricks Jack into infecting the main system with a virus on the floppy without getting him to explicitly invoke the virus program is, well, not very realistic. One of my favorites was the ability for Angela to easily read binary code, and in a matter of seconds, identify and isolate an absolutely new virus. This is indeed a superwoman. There were lots of other things too, but they would only be distractions to people who actually make their living writing software.I recommend this film.",3,Identity Crisis,974246400,"11 15, 2000",2000,2821,"['Net', 'combines', 'elements', 'techno', 'paranoidism', 'action', 'usual', 'gender', 'roles', 'result', 'little', 'uneven', 'still', 'worth', 'watching.The', 'premise', 'isolated', 'brilliant', 'software', 'engineer', 'Angela', 'Bennett', 'played', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'identity', 'stolen', 'when', 'conspiracy', 'involving', 'trap', 'doors', 'software', 'security', 'system', 'used', 'many', 'federal', 'state', 'private', 'databases.Although', 'stolen', 'identities', 'are', 'hot', 'topic', 'today', 'issues', 'ability', 'steal', 'someone', 'identity', 'proportional', 'how', 'isolated', 'individual', 'may', 'be', 'theft', 'made', 'easier', 'Angela', 'life', 'very', 'isolated', 'home', 'communicates', 'primarily', 'telephone', 'internet', 'are', 'lots', 'people', 'who', 'would', 'like', 'meet', 'off.The', 'technological', 'portion', 'film', 'interesting', 'how', 'person', 'who', 'computerized', 'output', 'can', 'be', 'murdered', 'when', 'someone', 'else', 'data', 'bases', 'over', 'conspiracy', 'isolate', 'kill', 'Angela.The', 'action', 'part', 'film', 'most', 'cliches', 'common', 'type', 'genre', 'get', 'chase', 'crowd', 'merry-go-round', 'darken', 'street', 'several', 'times', 'freeway', 'bridge', 'crossing', 'boat', 'amusement', 'park', 'finally', 'catwalk', 'first', 'couple', 'times', 'are', 'OK', 'while', 'get', 'tired.Fortunately', 'film', 'saved', 'usual', 'gender', 'roles', 'true', 'action', 'heros', 'one', 'suddenly', 'SAVES', 'Angela', 'Everyone', 'get', 'help', 'are', 'killed', 'isolated', 'end', 'Angela', 'using', 'same', 'wits', 'knowledge', 'made', 'much', 'sought', 'engineer', 'back', 'identity', 'conspiracy', 'bad', 'guy.I', 'Sandra', 'Bullock', 'isolated', 'awkward', 'character', 'pat', 'still', 'enough', 'pluck', 'fight', 'back', 'Jeremy', 'Northam', 'heavy', 'smooth', 'enough', 'stare', 'down', 'cobra', 'have', 'psychopathic', 'personality', 'hold', 'check', 'relief', 'keyboard.I', 'wanted', 'scream', 'technology', 'film', 'flashing', 'terminal', 'showing', 'lots', 'overlaying', 'screens', 'suppose', 'was', 'suppose', 'represent', 'Trap', 'Door', 'was', 'laughable', 'way', 'Angela', 'Jack', 'infecting', 'main', 'system', 'virus', 'floppy', 'getting', 'explicitly', 'invoke', 'virus', 'program', 'well', 'not', 'very', 'realistic', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'ability', 'Angela', 'easily', 'read', 'binary', 'code', 'matter', 'seconds', 'identify', 'isolate', 'absolutely', 'new', 'virus', 'indeed', 'superwoman', 'were', 'lots', 'other', 'things', 'too', 'would', 'only', 'be', 'distractions', 'people', 'who', 'actually', 'make', 'living', 'writing', 'software.I', 'recommend', 'film']",N/A
