The poses, the pacing, the demonstrations and the voiced instruction are excellent. It is clear, uncluttered and focused. I think this may be a perfect or near-perfect practice and the DVD presentation of it is a blessing for which I am very grateful. Most highly recommended. There are additional features, beyond the yoga programs, and some of it describes Peggy Cappy's attitude and philosophy about yoga and this is very refreshing and encouraging as well. There are also interviews or testimonials with some of her students - ""real people"" - and those are very inspiring and encouraging,too. Excellent.

1098886,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,B000V5YP1O,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[40, 41]","This is the first yoga DVD that I have ever tried from instructor Peggy Cappy.  I've never really been interested in Cappy's offerings before, as I had thought of her work to be mainly for beginners, and I consider myself to be more of a high intermediate yoga student.  However, I recently experienced a strain to my lower back, which has caused me to seek out more therapeutic yoga practices designed specifically for the low back area.  After reading some excellent reviews of this DVD, I decided to check it out from my local library.In her 7-minute Introduction, Cappy states that this DVD follows the same format as her other videos in that it consists of shorter segments which can be used separately or together.  She notes that the main part of the workout is the three segments (Parts 2-5) which offer exercises for the back either lying on the back, on the side/hands and knees, or on the stomach; the remaining chapters, particularly the restorative postures, are what she describes as ""bonus"" sections.  [Given this, I found the sequencing of the DVD to be rather odd--wouldn't it have made more sense for the Restorative Poses chapter to appear at the end?]Cappy instructs the practice live in a large, carpeted room.  There are two background exercisers, David and Renee, and Cappy alternates between practicing along with them and simply guiding them through the routine.  You will need several props for this practice, including a yoga mat, a chair, a blanket, a towel or small pillow, and a yoga strap or other long tie.The Main Menu of the DVD is as follows:PlayScene SelectionAccessibility Options [includes closed captioning]Other Products of InterestThe ""Scene Selection"" option takes you to a chapter menu.  I have listed each of the segments along with approximate times, and I have provided brief descriptions of the segments as well.Introduction (7 mins.)Cappy states that 80% of people experience back pain at some point! :oPart 1: Restorative Poses (8 mins.)This segment features just two postures.  Cappy has David perform Legs on a Chair while Renee shows Legs Up the Wall with several variations (i.e., wide legged, legs in cobbler's pose).Part 2: On The Back--Leg & Back Stretches (25.5 mins.)This is the heart of the practice.  David and Renee begin on their backs with their knees bent as Cappy leads them through simple moves, sliding their feet in and out.  Cappy then joins them on the floor for a longer series which includes knee-in-to-chest, happy baby, reclined cobbler, thread the needle, cross-leg twist, abs strengthening, half-bridge, simple twist, and finally, staff pose.Part 3: On The Side--Half Bow Pose/On Hands and Knees--Leg & Back Stretches (13 mins.)Beginning in a side-lying pose, Cappy instructs a few leg lifts to stretch the outer hip and thigh and then performs a quad stretch (a.k.a. half-bow).  Moving to hands and knees, she then cues cat/cow stretches and finishes with lifting an alternate arm/leg (a.k.a. bird-dog).Part 4: On The Belly--Locust & Cobra Pose Variations (10 mins.)Cappy does not perform these movements herself.  Instead, she first leads David and Renee through locust variations, starting with lifting a single arm and leg and then both arms/both legs.  Next comes 4 variations of cobra pose:  sphinx, sphinx with legs bent, full cobra, and finally, hands clasped behind the back.  This section concludes with two repetitions of child's pose.Part 5: Hamstring Stretches--Back Of Thigh (12.5 mins.)This is another bonus segment.  The entire section consists of the reclined leg stretch series (hand-to-big toe pose) using the strap; versions 1, 2, and 3 of this posture are included.Part 6: Three Part Breath Exercise (8 mins.)Here Cappy provides instruction on using the yogic full breath.Part 7: Guided Relaxation (11 mins.)For the relaxation, David is set up with his legs on a chair, and Renee has a blanket under her thighs; both of these positions are supposed to make the back more comfortable.  Throughout the relaxation, Cappy provides instruction to relax and soften various areas of the body.  One thing she said which surprised me was that it was okay to fall asleep; every other yoga instructor I've ever encountered has always stressed the importance of remaining alert (yet relaxed) during savasana.More About Peggy Cappy [Interview w/Cappy and Others] (28 mins.)Overall, this is a good, gentle approach to back care.  Part 2 in particular was the most similar to other therapeutic videos that I have used, and I found it to be very appropriate for working with my lower back injury.  Otherwise, this is not a DVD I would normally use, as it has segments that I found unnecessary (for example, I already knew how to do Three Part Breath).  In addition, it was VERY slow-moving--that was okay for now while I am still healing, but because even Cappy's voice is very slow, I think the pacing of this practice would begin to annoy me over time.In summary, I would definitely recommend this DVD to someone who has a back injury for using on a short-term basis.  It may also be appropriate for those new to yoga and/or anyone who would simply prefer a slower-paced practice session.",4,"Overall solid, gentle approach to addressing back issues",1282521600,"08 23,

I have been through two lower back surgeries and still suffer severe back pain. The exercises in this DVD have cut my upper and lower back pain by a lot since I began them last week. I like Peggy Cappy and her style. The exercises are divided up into sections. I do the ones I can do and leave out the ones that are difficult. I have been sleeping a lot better since learning how to do the yogic breath. The restorative poses are great, too. At the end of the DVD, Peggy's students talk about what yoga has done for them and I feel encouraged by their stories. I also have Peggy's Arthritis and Easing Pain DVD's and recommend them very highly. Yoga is for anyone and everyone of varying levels. I really enjoy it and I am just a beginner.",5,"Finally, exercise I can do for my back pain",1346112000,"08 28, 2012",2012,860,"['did', ""n't"", 'think', 'could', 'do', 'exercise', 'other', 'walking', 'tried', 'Back', 'Care', 'Basics', 'low', 'upper', 'back', 'pain', 'have', 'been', 'two', 'lower', 'back', 'surgeries', 'still', 'suffer', 'severe', 'back', 'pain', 'exercises', 'DVD', 'have', 'cut', 'upper', 'lower', 'back', 'pain', 'lot', 'began', 'last', 'week', 'like', 'Peggy', 'Cappy', 'style', 'exercises', 'are', 'divided', 'up', 'sections', 'do', 'ones', 'can', 'do', 'leave', 'out', 'ones', 'are', 'difficult', 'have', 'been', 'sleeping', 'lot', 'better', 'learning', 'how', 'do', 'yogic', 'breath', 'restorative', 'poses', 'are', 'great', 'too', 'end', 'DVD', 'Peggy', 'students', 'talk', 'what', 'yoga', 'done', 'feel', 'encouraged', 'stories', 'also', 'have', 'Peggy', 'Arthritis', 'Easing', 'Pain', 'DVD', 'recommend', 'very', 'highly', 'Yoga', 'anyone', 'everyone', 'varying', 'levels', 'really', 'enjoy', 'am', 'just', 'beginner']",N/A
