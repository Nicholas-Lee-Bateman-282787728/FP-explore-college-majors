So it's refreshing to watch one that's actually about trying to govern a nation.  First Among Equals does have its share of sex and violence, but that's because they are inescapable aspects of trying to govern a nation.  I just wish there were series like this about the government of the United States.  I don't know that much about British government, but this series makes it seem a lot more representative than the U.S. variety.  Perhaps that's because the U.S. is less and less a nation, and more and more a kind of transnational empire, more concerned with dealing with the other transnational empires-- China, Russia-- than with its own citizens.This is a very good DVD set, with the nice pre-2008 soft plastic covers, although American language subtitles would have helped sometimes.

1170002,AO1Z0TQWCRGL4,B001B1Q2VI,"Harold Wolf ""Doc""","[22, 22]","New Scottish MP, Andrew Fraser, is joined by new MP, mid class lawyer Raymond Gould, on the Labor party side of government.  New MPs, wealthy Charles Seymour and his personal rival, Simon Kerslake, both sit on the Tory side.  It is British politics as its finest, or worst as the moment dictates.  It doesn't take a lot of former knowledge of how the government from the islands works to enjoy this 10-part series.The story is more about how the 4 new MPs work and connive to further their ambition of becoming Prime Minister.  Only one will succeed.  Who?  How?  Well, I'll not tell who, but the how is through 20-plus years of political and personal manipulation of people and events.  Each man seems willing to use almost anything and anyone at times to get to the desired office.  It's not unlike American politics and the Presidential quest.There is sex and prostitutes (models they call themselves) willing to bare all (and do onscreen) to help, and also to get what they want.  Wives are sacrificed, or used, or replaced, or relied on at times.  The debates and bickering that take place on the floor of legislature brings many a chuckle as each attempts to put the opposition in its place--but using the most delicate of language, in the stiff, polite, British fashion.You'll find yourself booing one man, then applauding the same ambitious fellow in the next segment.  One thing for sure, you won't want to pause between the 10 episodes.Money, sex, power, fighting, killing, mystery, drama, laughs, and London all packaged into this powerful Parliament political package.",5,"Sex, backstabbing, relationships, and more in this British political saga",1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,1580,"['New', 'Scottish', 'MP', 'Andrew', 'Fraser', 'joined', 'new', 'MP', 'mid', 'class', 'lawyer', 'Raymond', 'Gould', 'Labor', 'party', 'side', 'government', 'New', 'MPs', 'wealthy', 'Charles', 'Seymour', 'personal', 'rival', 'Simon', 'Kerslake', 'sit', 'Tory', 'side', 'British', 'politics', 'finest', 'worst', 'moment', ""n't"", 'take', 'lot', 'former', 'knowledge', 'how', 'government', 'islands', 'enjoy', '10-part', 'series.The', 'story', 'more', 'how', '4', 'new', 'MPs', 'work', 'connive', 'further', 'ambition', 'becoming', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Only', 'one', 'will', 'succeed', 'Who', 'How', 'Well', ""'ll"", 'not', 'tell', 'who', 'how', '20-plus', 'years', 'political', 'personal', 'manipulation', 'people', 'events', 'man', 'willing', 'use', 'almost', 'anything', 'anyone', 'times', 'get', 'desired', 'office', 'not', 'American', 'politics', 'Presidential', 'quest.There', 'sex', 'prostitutes', 'models', 'call', 'willing', 'bare', 'do', 'onscreen', 'help', 'also', 'get', 'what', 'want', 'Wives', 'are', 'sacrificed', 'used', 'replaced', 'relied', 'times', 'debates', 'bickering', 'take', 'place', 'floor', 'legislature', 'many', 'chuckle', 'attempts', 'put', 'opposition', 'place', 'using', 'most', 'delicate', 'language', 'stiff', 'polite', 'British', 'fashion.You', ""'ll"", 'find', 'booing', 'one', 'man', 'then', 'applauding', 'same', 'ambitious', 'fellow', 'next', 'segment', 'One', 'thing', 'sure', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'pause', '10', 'episodes.Money', 'sex', 'power', 'fighting', 'killing', 'mystery', 'drama', 'London', 'packaged', 'powerful', 'Parliament', 'political', 'package']",First Among Equals

1170004,A1M1Y5UGONAW06,B001B1Q2VI,Jody,"[2, 2]","Americans find British politics fascinating, with its labyrinthine old boy networks and swiftly shifting alliances and loyalties, not to mention those career derailing votes of no confidence. First Among Equals follows four newly minted MPs from the day they take their oaths in 1966 through the next twenty-five years.  Because of the title, we know that one of these gentlemen will wind up as Prime Minister. Aside from the great characters, it's interesting to watch the Viet Nam War, Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis through this British prism.Fans of the book should know that Charles Hampton, resident of Eaton Square has become Charles Seymour of Knightsbridge.  The character of Andrew Fraser has been added to the original trio and some of the events that happened to other characters in the book have been transferred to Fraser and his family and a few other things have been changed--like the ending.The issues and pressures facing Seymour, Gould, Kerslake and Fraser are the same ones that show up in headlines all the time. Family obligations, marital difficulties, greed, the ever present power struggles and the weakness of character that leads to legal difficulties and vulnerability to blackmail.  All four have very different relationships with their wives and the wives' roles are as complicated and juicy as the four main characters.  The characters are neither caricature nor stereotype which makes for very rewarding viewing.Though it's wonderful that Acorn has made this series available on DVD, the quality is great. Originally recorded on tape instead of flim, the transcription to disc does nothing for that almost painful shallowness of picture that is peculiar to tape.  Some of the sound is muffled making dialogue difficult to understand, sometimes the images are indistinct, and there is one scene where everything is outlined in magenta.  Still, I'd rather have an imperfect version than none at all, but don't expect high quality.Special features are filmographies of the four main characters and a two screen biography of Jeffrey Archer.A quarter of a century from its first airing, besides the quality of the DVD, First Among Equals is still compelling. That was a pleasant surprise, since I really enjoyed it in 1986 and was afraid it wouldn't age well.  Another reviewer said that the actors in the principal roles do not fit Mr. Archer's descriptions.  Perhaps that's true, but after reading the book and seeing the series, it's difficult to imagine anyone else playing those roles.Here's the thing:  In my opinion, the book ended perfectly. The miniseries did not, and when I saw it, I felt cheated.  Despite the poor quality of the transfer to DVD, I would have rated it five stars had it stuck to the story. It's still worth seeing, just not five stars worth.",4,"Even after a quarter century, still timely",1271376000,"04 16, 2010",2010,2808,"['Americans', 'find', 'British', 'politics', 'fascinating', 'labyrinthine', 'old', 'boy', 'networks', 'swiftly', 'shifting', 'alliances', 'loyalties', 'not', 'mention', 'career', 'derailing', 'votes', 'confidence', 'First', 'Equals', 'four', 'newly', 'minted', 'MPs', 'day', 'take', 'oaths', '1966', 'next', 'twenty-five', 'years', 'title', 'know', 'one', 'gentlemen', 'will', 'wind', 'up', 'Prime', 'Minister', 'Aside', 'great', 'characters', 'interesting', 'watch', 'Viet', 'Nam', 'War', 'Watergate', 'Iranian', 'hostage', 'crisis', 'British', 'prism.Fans', 'book', 'should', 'know', 'Charles', 'Hampton', 'resident', 'Eaton', 'Square', 'become', 'Charles', 'Seymour', 'Knightsbridge', 'character', 'Andrew', 'Fraser', 'been', 'added', 'original', 'trio', 'events', 'happened', 'other', 'characters', 'book', 'have', 'been', 'transferred', 'Fraser', 'family', 'few', 'other', 'things', 'have', 'been', 'changed', 'ending.The', 'issues', 'pressures', 'facing', 'Seymour', 'Gould', 'Kerslake', 'Fraser', 'are', 'same', 'ones', 'show', 'up', 'headlines', 'time', 'Family', 'obligations', 'marital', 'difficulties', 'greed', 'ever', 'present', 'power', 'struggles', 'weakness', 'character', 'legal', 'difficulties', 'vulnerability', 'blackmail', 'four', 'have', 'very', 'different', 'relationships', 'wives', 'wives', 'roles', 'are', 'complicated', 'juicy', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'characters', 'are', 'caricature', 'stereotype', 'very', 'rewarding', 'wonderful', 'Acorn', 'made', 'series', 'available', 'DVD', 'quality', 'great', 'Originally', 'recorded', 'tape', 'instead', 'flim', 'transcription', 'disc', 'nothing', 'almost', 'painful', 'shallowness', 'picture', 'peculiar', 'tape', 'sound', 'muffled', 'making', 'dialogue', 'difficult', 'understand', 'sometimes', 'images', 'are', 'indistinct', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'everything', 'outlined', 'magenta', 'Still', ""'d"", 'rather', 'have', 'imperfect', 'version', 'none', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'high', 'quality.Special', 'features', 'are', 'filmographies', 'four', 'main', 'characters', 'two', 'screen', 'biography', 'Jeffrey', 'Archer.A', 'quarter', 'century', 'first', 'airing', 'quality', 'DVD', 'First', 'Equals', 'still', 'compelling', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'really', 'enjoyed', '1986', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', ""n't"", 'age', 'well', 'reviewer', 'said', 'actors', 'principal', 'roles', 'do', 'not', 'fit', 'Mr.', 'Archer', 'descriptions', 'Perhaps', 'true', 'reading', 'book', 'seeing', 'series', 'difficult', 'imagine', 'anyone', 'else', 'playing', 'thing', 'opinion', 'book', 'ended', 'perfectly', 'miniseries', 'did', 'not', 'when', 'saw', 'felt', 'cheated', 'poor', 'quality', 'transfer', 'DVD', 'would', 'have', 'rated', 'five', 'stars', 'had', 'stuck', 'story', 'still', 'worth', 'seeing', 'just', 'not', 'five', 'stars', 'worth']",First Among Equals
