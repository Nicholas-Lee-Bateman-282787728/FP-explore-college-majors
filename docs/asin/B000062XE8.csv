Lando is charming as the besotted King Gregory, Cinderella's husband, and Shirley Jones is beguiling as the fairy godmother. If you can get through the first 20 minutes, you can get through to the end.  The younger actors are stereotype cardboard characters, the script leaves a lot to be desired and the music is just horrible.  And there is really no need for a bumbling fairy godbrother or an evil wedding warlock (don't ask.) Young girls and tweens will probably love to add this TV movie to their collection, but older girls should stick with Ever After (Drew Barrymore.) Watch for a cameo of Stan Lee as the priest who marries Cinderella and shouts his trademark ""excelsior""!",3,Cinderella for the younger set,1168128000,"01 7, 2007",2007,747,"['Ok', 'bought', 'DVD', 'love', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Lando', 'charming', 'besotted', 'King', 'Gregory', 'Cinderella', 'husband', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'beguiling', 'fairy', 'godmother', 'can', 'get', 'first', '20', 'minutes', 'can', 'get', 'end', 'younger', 'actors', 'are', 'stereotype', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'script', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'music', 'just', 'horrible', 'really', 'need', 'bumbling', 'fairy', 'godbrother', 'evil', 'wedding', 'warlock', 'do', ""n't"", 'ask', 'Young', 'girls', 'tweens', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'add', 'TV', 'movie', 'collection', 'older', 'girls', 'should', 'stick', 'Ever', 'Drew', 'Barrymore', 'Watch', 'cameo', 'Stan', 'Lee', 'priest', 'who', 'Cinderella', 'trademark', 'excelsior']",N/A

I honestly watched this movie for two reasons: Shirley Jones and Joe Lando. I thought Shirley was beautiful as the Fairy Godmother, but the whole idea of a ""Fairy Godbrother"" for Cinderella's daughter, Cindy was unbearable. As for Joe Lando as King Gregory, no one was better suited as the once ""Prince Charming"". This movie is really many snippets of so-called adventures with outrageously silly antics that might appeal to girls more than boys aged 7 and up. The premise is the same, except this time it is Cindy who has fallen for a ""commoner"". The romance between Cinderella and Gregory is still very sweet, which helped me sit through the entire movie. Although mostly corny jokes and antics fill this movie, the acting from most(Shirley Jones, Joe Lando, Roger Rose) was good and it is family oriented to fit the times of today.",3,Corny Cinderella,1130284800,"10 26, 2005",2005,1003,"['grew', 'up', 'huge', 'fan', 'Cinderella', 'story', 'was', 'alittle', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'production', 'found', 'was', 'pilot', 'children', 'television', 'show', 'honestly', 'watched', 'movie', 'two', 'reasons', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'thought', 'Shirley', 'was', 'beautiful', 'Fairy', 'Godmother', 'whole', 'idea', 'Fairy', 'Godbrother', 'Cinderella', 'daughter', 'Cindy', 'was', 'unbearable', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'King', 'Gregory', 'one', 'was', 'better', 'suited', 'once', 'Prince', 'Charming', 'movie', 'really', 'many', 'snippets', 'so-called', 'adventures', 'outrageously', 'silly', 'antics', 'might', 'appeal', 'girls', 'more', 'boys', 'aged', '7', 'up', 'premise', 'same', 'time', 'Cindy', 'who', 'fallen', 'commoner', 'romance', 'Cinderella', 'Gregory', 'still', 'very', 'sweet', 'helped', 'sit', 'entire', 'movie', 'mostly', 'corny', 'jokes', 'antics', 'fill', 'movie', 'acting', 'most', 'Shirley', 'Jones', 'Joe', 'Lando', 'Roger', 'Rose', 'was', 'good', 'family', 'oriented', 'fit', 'times', 'today']",N/A
