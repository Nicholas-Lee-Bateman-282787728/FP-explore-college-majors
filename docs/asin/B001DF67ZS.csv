It's hard for citizens of PleasantValley to understand the hood and the mentality of the hoods who dwellthere. This movie brought that environment to life. Was it totallyaccurate in its portrayal? I can't say for sure, but I'm willing to goout on a limb and state that it is not totally inaccurate. The powerfulraw emotion of a man of God wanting to fight evil with evil and backingoff just before crossing the line was gripping. This is one of the bestChristian films I've seen for a while.

1180222,ABC8FXLD7W528,B001DF67ZS,"Penny Zeller, Christian Author and Speaker","[0, 0]","We recently purchased this movie. ""Saving God"" is well worth watching. It sends an excellent message of God's forgiveness - even for the most horrific sins - provided we are sincere in our repentance. It shows how God can use a redeemed person to change the lives of others for good and how God can turn something meant for bad into something good - just as His Word says. The acting was superb and the characters very believable. The message this movie sent was right on target; I would recommend it for anyone ages teen to adult due to some scary moments that would be too much for younger viewers.My only complaint about the movie was that it ended too abruptly. I wanted to see more and how God had fully changed the lives of those in the movie. Other than that, I would highly recommend this movie.

I can see why Christians will line up to see this movie and all power to them but cinematically the bad guys are unbelievable and the good guys are cardboard cut outs of real people. As far as a story of redemption goes this has more in common with Hansel and Gretal than real life. This film is sanctimoneous in it delivery, presumptive in it's attitude and arrogant toward real hardship.

This moving had both action and emotion tied in. Itis worth taking time out of your busy schedule to see this. It is veryencouraging to see how God can change a person. I really don't know if it would be a useful tool for salvation but I think that even those who are not christians will enjoy this. It is not ""in your face preaching. It is just watching one man who did something bad in the past -how he and God changed his life--how God used him to change someone else's life.As a christian -it was VERY ENCOURAGING.I do think that it is for children under 12 maybe 13 --just depends on how mature they are.This movie is something like you could see happen in today's times.I love the part where Pastor Cane questions the other pastor about ""knowing"" the parishners--about is he just up there preaching for the money and what he can get and selling God or is he really trying to make a difference in the people--is he available when someone in his church is hurting and needs comfort or prayer or just to talk.

1180225,A1S8AJIUIO6M9K,B001DF67ZS,Robert David STEELE Vivas,"[0, 0]","From Wikipedia in English:  Irving Rameses ""Ving"" Rhames (born May 12, 1959) is an American actor best known for his work in Pulp Fiction, Don King: Only in America, and the Mission: Impossible film series.I put that up there because for me he will always be one of the main actors inEntrapment (Special Edition)where he very strangely has not received the credit he deserves as a supporting actor.I am glad that all the Christians like this movie, but for me is is not a Christian movie per se, but rather a movie about raw life, the contradictions and challenges, and more often than most people realize, the unexpected openings for salvation and a new direction.  The end is gripping, it can inspire tears.Ving Rhames is the lead actor here (as he was in the sequel to Kojak as a series) and I would very much like to see him featured in other movies.  Solid as a rock and that refers to his mind and his presence, not his body.Absolutely recommended for viewing by anyone, not just families, and especially anyone who thinks they are ""stuck.""  Taking a line fromHuman Target: The Complete First Season, ""You're not as stuck as you think you are.""
