The truth will leave you feeling allot of controversy. Was this war justified or not???  I lost four family members in this war.  When I see this movie and others on this topic, it makes me angry.  This is a war that could have been avoided.  And if not avoided then it should have been put into the hands of our generals and left to them to decide how to win it.  But according to the Pentagon Papers, our country could not have ever won this war.  I hate to think that so many of our soldiers died in vein, to include my own family members.

James Spader--an extraordinarily gifted actor--gives a top-notch portrayal of Daniel Ellsberg, which keeps the viewers' attention throughout the course of the film. The story has a fascinating plot that explores a complex question: is treason justifiable when it will reveal the truth to the public? Should revealing classified documents to prove the failures of the Vietnam war be considered treason...or should it be considered an act of patriotism? This film thoughtfully considers these questions and more, and leaves you to form your own opinions about whether Ellsberg's actions were right or wrong.If you are a fan of James Spader, this film is a must...as he is at his best here.

Schumacher,"[4, 4]","This movie starts very slowly, but picks up momentum fast.It is a clear and even moving account of Daniel Ellsberg, and his transformation from a gung-ho military analyst to the foremost opponent of the Vietnam War.It does a great job in making his evolution believable.The acting is good.  James Spader is robotic, but that's appropriate to Ellsberg himself.  Paul Giamatti is great as his also-evolving colleague.  Claire Forlani begins better than she ends; toward the end of the movie she seems to be simply going through the motions--her performance lacks fire and sincerity.  The woman who plays Ellsberg's first wife, however, is sensational.Several nice touches:The quick cuts between historical footage and what is happening in the film are seamless and powerful.The scenes in Vietnam are a revelation.The take on Nixon's thugs (Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Mitchell) is astonishing.An informative, powerful film.",4,Good Historical Pic,1297900800,"02 17, 2011",2011,915,"['movie', 'very', 'slowly', 'up', 'momentum', 'fast.It', 'clear', 'even', 'moving', 'account', 'Daniel', 'Ellsberg', 'transformation', 'gung-ho', 'military', 'analyst', 'foremost', 'opponent', 'Vietnam', 'War.It', 'great', 'job', 'making', 'evolution', 'believable.The', 'acting', 'good', 'James', 'Spader', 'robotic', 'appropriate', 'Ellsberg', 'Paul', 'Giamatti', 'great', 'also-evolving', 'colleague', 'Claire', 'Forlani', 'better', 'end', 'movie', 'be', 'simply', 'going', 'motions', 'performance', 'fire', 'sincerity', 'woman', 'who', 'Ellsberg', 'first', 'wife', 'however', 'sensational.Several', 'nice', 'touches', 'quick', 'cuts', 'historical', 'footage', 'what', 'happening', 'film', 'are', 'seamless', 'powerful.The', 'scenes', 'Vietnam', 'are', 'revelation.The', 'take', 'Nixon', 'thugs', 'Haldeman', 'Ehrlichman', 'Mitchell', 'astonishing.An', 'informative', 'powerful', 'film']",The Pentagon Papers

A brilliant, driven man, a former Marine & a major up-&-coming intellectual star during Lyndon Johnson's presidency, he began his work for the Department of Defense as an avid hawk regarding Vietnam. We were right to be there, we had to be there, we were going to win!Or so he believed before harsh reality set in ....Troubled by the massive discrepancies in official reports arriving from Vietnam, he volunteered to be an observer in the field, eventually staying in Vietnam for a couple of years. During that time, he saw more & more that the war was not only unwinnable, but essentially immoral. As he himself would eventually put it, ""We aren't on the wrong side, we ARE the wrong side.""Upon returning to his position with the Rand Corporation, he was one of the contributors to the in-house, secret history of the war in Vietnam commissioned by Robert McNamara. When he began reading its 7000+ pages, he was shocked by what he discovered: a history of lies, deceptions, and moral blindness that permeated several presidencies, both Democratic & Republican. This tore his life apart, and his conscience would not allow him to remain silent. The American people had a right to know what was being done in their names, behind their backs.And so he made his choice: to release the Pentagon Papers to the press, so that the public could know the truth. Ellsberg knew very well that he might face a lifetime in jail, but he would not be deterred. And the fallout was greater than anyone might have expected: Nixon's infamous ""plumbers unit"" that was also responsible for Watergate, which led led to the downfall of of his corrupt presidency. It was also a major victory for freedom of the press.This taut docudrama gets all the facts right, and provides a multi-faceted view of Ellsberg, flaws & all. James Spader gives a superb performance, and Rod Holcomb's direction avoids the banalities of made-for-TV movies. Paul Giamatti has a wonderful supporting role as Ellsberg's friend, a Rand social scientist who becomes much more radical & countercultural during the 1960s. It's the perfect companion to the outstanding documentary ""The Most Dangerous Man in America"" -- both films should be seen.It's amazing that this film was even made, much less broadcast during the early days of the Iraq War -- another disaster of American policy that the film comments on indirectly, since it's so much a repetition of Vietnam, right down to the lies used to plunge us into it. The only difference is that today, both the press & the public are far more willing to accept The Official Story put forth by the powers that be, rather than look for the harsh truth.
