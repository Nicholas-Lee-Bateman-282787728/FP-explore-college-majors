Full of action and humor.  Great chemistry between the actors.  Great writing (usually) and lots of fun and entertainment.  The production values are very good.  Good supporting cast, some great guest stars, and an interesting story line.  But the main thing is, it's entertaining!!!  These guys understand the deal and they deliver.",4,Great action series that delivers the fun!,1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,455,"['Great', 'action', 'series', 'great', 'crew', 'guys', 'are', 'experienced', 'know', 'how', 'make', 'good', 'TV', 'series', 'Full', 'action', 'humor', 'Great', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'Great', 'writing', 'usually', 'lots', 'fun', 'entertainment', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'Good', 'supporting', 'cast', 'great', 'guest', 'stars', 'interesting', 'story', 'line', 'main', 'thing', 'entertaining', 'guys', 'understand', 'deal', 'deliver']",N/A

Then we just watch them from our own 'library' whenever we want (via our blueray or other internet-ready players) . Really cool, and excellent quality.I love everything about this show, especially all the supporting characters. I only watched the 1st episode to see Sharon Gless, but was forever hooked in 5 minutes.  Finishing up season 5 now, and it's still my favorite show (next to Fringe & House). Glad they're having more action with the mom this season. I've grown to appreciate Jesse's added quirks to the show. The villains can be pretty evil. Jeffrey Donavan obviously puts all he has into his character(s) ... and I love his hair, no matter what it looks like! Still love the occasional sparring between Sam and Fi :) She's a hoot when kids are in the plots. I've become a fan of mohito's thanks to Sam!",5,Good family entertainment,1323216000,"12 7, 2011",2011,925,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'subscribing', 'Amazon', 'instant', 'video', '2.80', 'HD', 'episode', 'come', 'out', 'Then', 'just', 'watch', 'own', ""'library"", 'whenever', 'want', 'blueray', 'other', 'internet-ready', 'players', 'Really', 'cool', 'excellent', 'quality.I', 'everything', 'show', 'especially', 'supporting', 'characters', 'only', 'watched', '1st', 'episode', 'see', 'Sharon', 'Gless', 'was', 'forever', 'hooked', '5', 'minutes', 'Finishing', 'up', 'season', '5', 'now', 'still', 'favorite', 'show', 'next', 'Fringe', 'House', 'Glad', ""'re"", 'having', 'more', 'action', 'mom', 'season', ""'ve"", 'grown', 'appreciate', 'Jesse', 'added', 'quirks', 'show', 'villains', 'can', 'be', 'pretty', 'evil', 'Jeffrey', 'Donavan', 'obviously', 'character', 's', 'love', 'hair', 'matter', 'what', 'Still', 'love', 'occasional', 'sparring', 'Sam', 'Fi', 'hoot', 'when', 'kids', 'are', 'plots', ""'ve"", 'become', 'fan', 'mohito', 'thanks', 'Sam']",N/A
