This is a stunning, beautifully filmed adaptation of the great novel and brilliantly acted. The entire cast is perfect. It might be a little slow for some viewers, which was possibly the reason it didn't do quite as well as expected when it was first released. I always felt that was deliberate, because iit echoed the pace of country life as it was then. I saw it in 70mm which was wonderful. It's still deeply moving, and totally mesmerising. John Scleshinger made some great films, and this is one of them. Just make sure you get the anamorphic disc with the full wide screen image, because the photography is stunning. There is a terrible 'pan and scan' version out there and is to be avoided at all costs. Get a copy of this film if you love superior period drama.

She is not afraid to show natural emotion even if it means looking less than glamorous. Peter Finch absolutely smolders as the spurned Boldwood. Terrence Stamp is a smiling rogue. The best of all, however, is Alan Bates as Gabriel Oak, the one man who truly deserves to win Bathsheba. Bates is exactly perfect as the nearly saintly Gabriel.

136992,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792836480,Andrew Ellington,"[6, 6]","How this movie missed out on a Cinematography nomination from The Academy is beyond me, especially since it's some of the best I've ever seen.  Each sweeping scene is captured with such delicacy and earthy wonderment.  Those sweeping landscapes and cascading hills, green with supple vegetation and trampled by sheep are only part of the allure, especially since the magical use of light and the progression of darkness in the more intimate scenes are equally haunting.  Honestly, the snub is beyond me.  The fact that this only received ONE nomination (for its tremendous score) baffles me.  I understand that 1967 was a great year for film, possibly the best next to 1939, and that many wonderful films were snubbed in deserving categories because of the bounty of films to choose from, but it's odd to me that a film of this nature didn't catch on and that it is pretty much ignored by the masses today.Who has seen this movie?This is not what I expected it to be.  For some weird reason I assumed that this had to do with royalty of some sort and was expecting some kind of `The Madness of King George' or something of the sort, and so when I was introduced to a love triangle set on a farm I was taken aback and bit and ultimately pleased to find something more profound and involving than I initially expected.I reiterate; how did this not catch on with Oscar?In the film we are introduced to Bathsheba Everdene, a young woman who has great ambitions that do not include marriage to a poor shepherd, Gabriel, despite his affections for her.  Instead, she passes on his proposal of marriage and they part ways, he to establish his own farm and her to waltz into an inheritance that immediately makes her a valued property.  Fate reunites the pair, but not before Bathsheba is able to catch the eye of a soldier promised in marriage to another young woman and a wealthy bachelor determined to earn her love.  Gabriel looms in the backdrop, observing Bathsheba's poor decisions and the reckless way she weaves through love, or the perception of it.The rich character development here is astonishing, and while Bathsheba may be at the center of the film, it is the three men who surround her that really grab our attention.  Peter Finch, Alan Bates and Terence Stamp are astonishingly good here, and all of them so different and representative of varying aspects of Bathsheba's own persona and life course.  Finch is probably my favorite here, but Bates is equally as haunting, and Stamp is certainly the scene stealer, with his larger than life portrayal of a man as selfish as he is commanding.I highly recommend this beautiful film.  It is a long one, but it moves with grace, and keeps us hooked from open to close.",5,Far from what I expected...,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",2013,2721,"['How', 'movie', 'missed', 'out', 'Cinematography', 'nomination', 'Academy', 'especially', 'best', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'sweeping', 'scene', 'captured', 'such', 'delicacy', 'earthy', 'wonderment', 'sweeping', 'landscapes', 'cascading', 'hills', 'green', 'supple', 'vegetation', 'trampled', 'sheep', 'are', 'only', 'part', 'allure', 'especially', 'magical', 'use', 'light', 'progression', 'darkness', 'more', 'intimate', 'scenes', 'are', 'equally', 'haunting', 'Honestly', 'snub', 'fact', 'only', 'received', 'ONE', 'nomination', 'tremendous', 'score', 'understand', '1967', 'was', 'great', 'year', 'film', 'possibly', 'best', 'next', '1939', 'many', 'wonderful', 'films', 'were', 'snubbed', 'deserving', 'categories', 'bounty', 'films', 'choose', 'odd', 'film', 'nature', 'did', ""n't"", 'catch', 'pretty', 'much', 'ignored', 'masses', 'today.Who', 'seen', 'movie', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'be', 'weird', 'reason', 'assumed', 'had', 'do', 'royalty', 'sort', 'was', 'expecting', 'kind', 'Madness', 'King', 'George', 'something', 'sort', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'introduced', 'love', 'triangle', 'set', 'farm', 'was', 'taken', 'aback', 'bit', 'ultimately', 'pleased', 'find', 'something', 'more', 'profound', 'involving', 'initially', 'expected.I', 'reiterate', 'how', 'did', 'not', 'catch', 'Oscar', 'film', 'are', 'introduced', 'Bathsheba', 'Everdene', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'great', 'ambitions', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'marriage', 'poor', 'shepherd', 'Gabriel', 'affections', 'Instead', 'proposal', 'marriage', 'part', 'ways', 'establish', 'own', 'farm', 'waltz', 'inheritance', 'immediately', 'valued', 'property', 'Fate', 'pair', 'not', 'Bathsheba', 'able', 'catch', 'eye', 'soldier', 'promised', 'marriage', 'young', 'woman', 'wealthy', 'bachelor', 'determined', 'earn', 'love', 'Gabriel', 'backdrop', 'observing', 'Bathsheba', 'poor', 'decisions', 'reckless', 'way', 'love', 'perception', 'it.The', 'rich', 'character', 'development', 'here', 'astonishing', 'Bathsheba', 'may', 'be', 'center', 'film', 'three', 'men', 'who', 'surround', 'really', 'grab', 'attention', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'are', 'astonishingly', 'good', 'here', 'so', 'different', 'representative', 'varying', 'aspects', 'Bathsheba', 'own', 'persona', 'life', 'course', 'Finch', 'probably', 'favorite', 'here', 'Bates', 'equally', 'haunting', 'Stamp', 'certainly', 'scene', 'stealer', 'larger', 'life', 'portrayal', 'man', 'as', 'selfish', 'commanding.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'beautiful', 'film', 'long', 'one', 'grace', 'hooked', 'open', 'close']",N/A

It follows the book extremely well, and that is a plus, for the book is wonderful.  The plot is not intricate butinteresting; the characters are so human, and the actors are better than adequate.  Julie Chistie and Alan Bates are two of myfavorite English actors, and they are wonderful here as ambiguous friends with obvious romantic overtones.  Unfortunately,Bates has to wait his turn because Christie has two other suitors--one is worthy, the other is rather treacherous.

Julie Christie was too old for the part of Bathsheba, did not fit Hardy's description of her at all, and has never impressed me as much of an actress -- an opinion which has only been substantiated by her high-school-calibre performance in this film -- a MAJOR casting faux pas! (and a slap on the hand to the makeup artist who made this supposed 19th-century character even more farcical by piling on the makeup until she looked like a Vogue cover girl, rather than the mistress of Weatherbury Farm).Peter Finch's performance, as Boldwood, was admirable (actually the best of the film, in my opinion), but just did not elicit the strong feeling of empathy from me, as Nigel Terry did in the Masterpiece Theatre version. In all fairness, Finch did not seem to have as much screen time, so character development was lacking.The greatest surprise to me, in regard to this film, was that I also felt the same about Alan Bates' performance as Gabriel Oak -- he just did not convey the emotions and the quality of Oak's character, as described by Hardy in the book, and I found his portrayal to be PAINFULLY bland and boring. He seemed as though he was reading his lines straight off a teleprompter -- emotion and warmth were virtually non-existent! (a STRIKING contrast to Nathaniel Parker's sensitive, powerful, heart-wrenching portrayal of Oak in the 1998 film).Part of the blame would have to be shared by the director of this version -- the actors APPEARED to be acting, and neither they, nor the director, seemed to have a firm grasp or understanding of the explicit emotions and personalities of the characters, which Hardy had gone to great effort and detail to describe in the book.I highly recommend to anyone who has seen only this version -- or to anyone who has never seen either version -- that you rent or buy the 1998 Masterpiece Theatre film, which is truer to Hardy's book (although some changes were made in that adaptation also, due to time constraints, it wasn't nearly as &quot;choppy&quot; as this one), and is a quality production in every way, and brilliantly acted, from the main players right down through the supporting cast.",1,I thought I'd give this a second chance....,1080604800,"03 30, 2004",2004,2727,"['so', 'rented', 'watched', 'again', 'was', 'bit', 'bored', 'unimpressed', 'remembered', 'feeling', 'having', 'watched', 'first', 'time', 'Having', 'read', 'book', 'more', 'once', 'favorite', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'book', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'time', 'having', 'seen', 'filmed', 'versions', 'have', 'say', 'version', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'can', 'not', 'hold', 'candle', 'Mobil', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'remake', 'released', '1998', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'Paloma', 'Baeza', 'Nigel', 'Terry.This', 'Bates/Christie', 'version', 'was', 'great', 'disappointment', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'was', 'too', 'old', 'part', 'Bathsheba', 'did', 'not', 'fit', 'Hardy', 'description', 'never', 'impressed', 'much', 'actress', 'opinion', 'only', 'been', 'substantiated', 'high-school-calibre', 'performance', 'film', 'MAJOR', 'casting', 'faux', 'pas', 'slap', 'hand', 'makeup', 'artist', 'who', 'made', 'supposed', '19th-century', 'character', 'even', 'more', 'farcical', 'piling', 'makeup', 'looked', 'Vogue', 'cover', 'girl', 'rather', 'mistress', 'Weatherbury', 'Farm', '.Peter', 'Finch', 'performance', 'Boldwood', 'was', 'admirable', 'actually', 'best', 'film', 'opinion', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'elicit', 'strong', 'feeling', 'empathy', 'Nigel', 'Terry', 'did', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'version', 'fairness', 'Finch', 'did', 'not', 'seem', 'have', 'as', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'so', 'character', 'development', 'was', 'lacking.The', 'greatest', 'surprise', 'regard', 'film', 'was', 'also', 'felt', 'same', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'performance', 'Gabriel', 'Oak', 'just', 'did', 'not', 'convey', 'emotions', 'quality', 'Oak', 'character', 'described', 'Hardy', 'book', 'found', 'portrayal', 'be', 'PAINFULLY', 'bland', 'boring', 'seemed', 'was', 'reading', 'lines', 'straight', 'off', 'teleprompter', 'emotion', 'warmth', 'were', 'virtually', 'non-existent', 'STRIKING', 'contrast', 'Nathaniel', 'Parker', 'sensitive', 'powerful', 'heart-wrenching', 'portrayal', 'Oak', '1998', 'film', '.Part', 'blame', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'shared', 'director', 'version', 'actors', 'APPEARED', 'be', 'acting', 'director', 'seemed', 'have', 'firm', 'grasp', 'understanding', 'explicit', 'emotions', 'personalities', 'characters', 'Hardy', 'had', 'gone', 'great', 'effort', 'detail', 'describe', 'book.I', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'only', 'version', 'anyone', 'who', 'never', 'seen', 'version', 'rent', 'buy', '1998', 'Masterpiece', 'Theatre', 'film', 'truer', 'Hardy', 'book', 'changes', 'were', 'made', 'adaptation', 'also', 'due', 'time', 'constraints', 'was', ""n't"", 'nearly', 'quot', 'choppy', 'quot', 'one', 'quality', 'production', 'way', 'brilliantly', 'acted', 'main', 'players', 'right', 'down', 'supporting', 'cast']",N/A

His name just doesn't ring that vaguely pleasant bell -- like Edna Ferber, for  instance. As a result, his gloomy bucolic novels have rarely been presented  on the big screen. A 1924 silent version of &quot;Tess of the  D'Urbervilles&quot; was given a happy ending! (Roman Polanski corrected  that 55 years later with his &quot;Tess&quot;.) Things hadn't really  changed that much by 1967 when John Schlesinger released his version of the  1874 novel &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot;. The picture opened in  road-show style, complete with reserved seating, an intermission, and a  nearly three-hour length. To understand why it flopped, you must remember  this was the year of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and &quot;The Dirty  Dozen&quot;. (The Academy chose &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot; Best  Picture of the year.) Even though it ends with a fatal shooting, &quot;Far  From the Madding Crowd&quot; is about as far from Hollywood bang-bang as  you can get. One would think the flower children with their  back-to-the-earth sensibilities would have picked up on the picture's  pastoral beauty, but I think it was Hardy that cooled them and caused them  to turn to &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;. The movie was withdrawn from  distribution and, a few months later, it was chopped up, re-released, and  advertised with posters promising a sexual license that didn't exist. (I'm  amazed they didn't re-title it &quot;That Madding Girl!&quot;.) Now,  however, the film is available intact and in letter-box format; and,  because it is basically a complicated love story, it's a good movie for  home viewing. Schlesinger had already directed Julie Christie in two other  movies (including the acclaimed &quot;Darling&quot;) when he decided to  cast her as the headstrong, fascinating Bathsheba Everdene. The three men  she fascinates are each very different: Gabriel Oak, a strong, resourceful  shephard (in Hardy's novel, the central character); Francis Troy, a  hot-blooded soldier; and William Boldwood, a wealthy but neurotic  landowner. Critics had difficulty deciding which of the actors gave the  superlative performance: Alan Bates as Shephard Oak, the versatile Terence  Stamp (he who had played the angelic Billy Budd) as the opportunistic Sgt  Troy, or Peter Finch as Farmer Boldwood, a character Hardy might have  written with Finch in mind. They're all three excellent. Julie Christie is,  of course, about as 19th Century as a mini-skirt, but the anachronism  actually works in her favor here. Bathsheba (British pronunciation puts the  emphasis on the first syllable) is suppose to be a defiant character,  indifferent to woman's accepted role in Victorian society. &quot;I didn't  want you to think I was any man's property!&quot; she exclaims when  rejecting Gabriel's proposal. And later when she takes over her late  uncle's farm she determines to be her own bailiff, telling the men: &quot;I  shall astonish you all!&quot; (They seem a little confounded already.) It's  a prescient role (many of Hardy's contemporaries didn't like the  character), and Miss Christie takes it and runs with it. Her voluptuous  beauty has never been so glamorously photographed, but the same could be  said for the Dorsetshire countryside where the picture was shot on location  by Nicholas Roeg. This is one of the most gorgeous movies ever filmed, and  Richard Rodney Bennett's flavorful score (highlighted by English folk  songs) beautifully complements the visuals. (I have this score on LP but  cannot find it on CD.) The stars are supported by a perfect cast of  character actors speaking in the Hardyesque dialects provided for them by  Frederic Raphael's screenplay. &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; is a  rich cinematic experience for Hardy fans, Anglophiles, et al.",5,Far from the Hollywood glitz,967161600,"08 25, 2000",2000,3851,"['Thomas', 'Hardy', 'never', 'fared', 'particularly', 'well', 'movie-goers', 'name', 'just', ""n't"", 'ring', 'vaguely', 'pleasant', 'bell', 'Edna', 'Ferber', 'instance', 'result', 'gloomy', 'bucolic', 'novels', 'have', 'rarely', 'been', 'presented', 'big', 'screen', '1924', 'silent', 'version', 'quot', 'Tess', ""D'Urbervilles"", 'quot', 'was', 'given', 'happy', 'ending', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'corrected', '55', 'years', 'later', 'quot', 'Tess', 'quot', 'Things', 'had', ""n't"", 'really', 'changed', 'much', '1967', 'when', 'John', 'Schlesinger', 'released', 'version', '1874', 'novel', 'quot', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'quot', 'picture', 'opened', 'road-show', 'style', 'complete', 'reserved', 'seating', 'intermission', 'nearly', 'three-hour', 'length', 'understand', 'why', 'flopped', 'must', 'remember', 'was', 'year', 'quot', 'Bonnie', 'Clyde', 'quot', 'quot', 'Dirty', 'Dozen', 'quot', 'Academy', 'chose', 'quot', 'Heat', 'Night', 'quot', 'Best', 'Picture', 'year', 'Even', 'fatal', 'shooting', 'quot', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'quot', 'far', 'Hollywood', 'bang-bang', 'can', 'get', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'flower', 'children', 'back-to-the-earth', 'sensibilities', 'would', 'have', 'picked', 'up', 'picture', 'pastoral', 'beauty', 'think', 'was', 'Hardy', 'cooled', 'caused', 'turn', 'quot', 'Cool', 'Hand', 'Luke', 'quot', 'movie', 'was', 'withdrawn', 'distribution', 'few', 'months', 'later', 'was', 'chopped', 'up', 're-released', 'advertised', 'posters', 'promising', 'sexual', 'license', 'did', ""n't"", 'exist', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'did', ""n't"", 're-title', 'quot', 'Madding', 'Girl', 'quot', 'Now', 'however', 'film', 'available', 'intact', 'letter-box', 'format', 'basically', 'complicated', 'love', 'story', 'good', 'movie', 'home', 'viewing', 'Schlesinger', 'had', 'already', 'directed', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'two', 'other', 'movies', 'including', 'acclaimed', 'quot', 'Darling', 'quot', 'when', 'decided', 'cast', 'headstrong', 'fascinating', 'Bathsheba', 'Everdene', 'three', 'men', 'fascinates', 'are', 'very', 'different', 'Gabriel', 'Oak', 'strong', 'resourceful', 'shephard', 'Hardy', 'novel', 'central', 'character', 'Francis', 'Troy', 'hot-blooded', 'soldier', 'William', 'Boldwood', 'wealthy', 'neurotic', 'landowner', 'Critics', 'had', 'difficulty', 'deciding', 'actors', 'gave', 'superlative', 'performance', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'Shephard', 'Oak', 'versatile', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'who', 'had', 'played', 'angelic', 'Billy', 'Budd', 'opportunistic', 'Sgt', 'Troy', 'Peter', 'Finch', 'Farmer', 'Boldwood', 'character', 'Hardy', 'might', 'have', 'written', 'Finch', 'mind', ""'re"", 'three', 'excellent', 'Julie', 'Christie', 'course', 'about', '19th', 'Century', 'mini-skirt', 'anachronism', 'actually', 'favor', 'here', 'Bathsheba', 'British', 'pronunciation', 'emphasis', 'first', 'syllable', 'suppose', 'be', 'defiant', 'character', 'indifferent', 'woman', 'accepted', 'role', 'Victorian', 'society', 'quot', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'think', 'was', 'man', 'property', 'quot', 'when', 'rejecting', 'Gabriel', 'proposal', 'later', 'when', 'late', 'uncle', 'farm', 'be', 'own', 'bailiff', 'telling', 'men', 'quot', 'shall', 'astonish', 'quot', 'seem', 'little', 'confounded', 'already', 'prescient', 'role', 'many', 'Hardy', 'contemporaries', 'did', ""n't"", 'character', 'Miss', 'Christie', 'voluptuous', 'beauty', 'never', 'been', 'so', 'glamorously', 'photographed', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Dorsetshire', 'countryside', 'where', 'picture', 'was', 'shot', 'location', 'Nicholas', 'Roeg', 'one', 'most', 'gorgeous', 'movies', 'ever', 'filmed', 'Richard', 'Rodney', 'Bennett', 'flavorful', 'score', 'highlighted', 'English', 'folk', 'songs', 'beautifully', 'visuals', 'have', 'score', 'LP', 'can', 'not', 'find', 'CD', 'stars', 'are', 'supported', 'perfect', 'cast', 'character', 'actors', 'speaking', 'Hardyesque', 'dialects', 'provided', 'Frederic', 'Raphael', 'screenplay', 'quot', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'quot', 'rich', 'cinematic', 'experience', 'Hardy', 'fans', 'Anglophiles', 'et', 'al']",N/A

With a luminous, pouty lipped Julie Christie in the lead role of Bathsheba Everdene, and with Alan Bates, Terence Stamp, and Peter Finch, as the men in her life, how could the movie be anything but superb?Bathsheba Everdene (Julie Christie) inherits a large country estate. There, she proceeds to act as few women in her day would. She insists on managing the estate herself, relying on her own god given talents. Smart, hardworking, and strong willed, she captures the attention of three would be suitors. Gabriel Oak (Alan Bates), the handsome, strapping shepherd, with a penchant for animal husbandry and farming, is the one most suited for her. William Boldwood (Peter Finch), an older, wealthy, neighboring landowner, adores her and obsesses over making her his wife. Sgt. Frank Troy (Terrence Stamp), a hunky, rakish grenadier, knows opportunity when he sees it and sets about charming her, despite the fact that his heart belongs to another.Now, why would author Thomas Hardy name the leading female character Bathsheba? Well, in Biblical times, Bathsheba made the married King David, the shepherd who slew Goliath, her love slave. So much did David desire her that he arranged to have Bathsheba's husband, Uriah, a soldier in his army, slain in battle. The film parallels that Bible story in some ways and is somewhat prophetic for Bathsheba Everdene. What happens to her, as well as to each of the three men in her life, makes for an absorbing film experience.First class production values and wonderful performances by the entire cast, make this a film to remember. Terence Stamp is perfectly cast as the charming and rakish Frank Troy, who would steal Bathsheba's heart, while his still belonged to that of another woman, Fanny Robin (Prunella Ransome). Peter Finch plays the role of William Boldwood with such rock solid intensity that the viewer knows that sooner or later something has got to give. Alan Bates is perfect as the ruggedly handsome, stalwart and steadfast Gabriel Oak. Prunella Ransome gives a heartbreaking performance as the tender and bereft Fanny Robin. Julie Christie is well cast as the independent and outspoken Bathsheba, giving a luminous performance that engages the viewer.English folk songs pepper the film, adding to its period ambiance.

Alan Bates, rock steady, anchors this film, not Julie Christie's thoughtless Bathesheba. He does only right throughout the movie, unlike all the other characters.  Peter Finch, as the psychotically repressed Boldwood ignites the screen every time the camera comes on him; he exudes force.  And has there ever been a rake like Terence Stamp, or one more sympathetic in the film's emotional climax; the scene where he rejects the living Bathesba for the dead Franny.In retrospect, this film is the boilerplate for all those Masterpiece Theatre adaptions that began a few years later; still it greater than the best of these. This is one of those few films, like maybe Casablanca, or Citizen Kane, or Lean's Oliver Twist, where the perfect confluence of creative and technical achieved an apotheosis.  The only work comparable today: Ang Lee's films.  The common thread: the humanity of the characters shaped in their respective cultures.

137015,A3F1RS18J88FD5,0792836480,M. Morris,"[7, 11]","When I first watched the 1967 film version of Far from the Madding Crowd, I didn't think I would like it that well, because I loved the book, and had read a review of the movie that made it sound as if it would be a bad adaptation.  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  The acting was charismatic, even if some of the characters weren't portrayed exactly like their literary counterparts.  I also enjoyed the picture's musical score, and some of the scenes were extremely well-handled: i.e., Bathsheba firing the bailiff, her first meeting with Frank, Frank's sword demonstration, and the circus scene.  When I watched it again with my sister, she told me it held her interest, and that's something, because she usually gets bored by old movies - and that's when she watches them.  It held my interest too.  In fact, I think that if the script had been more faithful, that cast could have made this the best Thomas Hardy adaptation ever.  Unfortunately, the script is full of holes.Why on earth would Bathsheba send a valentine to Mr. Boldwood without provocation from Liddy?  And what could she possibly hope to learn from opening the coffin?  I know that both Bathsheba and Fanny have blond hair in this movie, but my sister realized the lock of hair scene (omitted in the film, and crucial in the book) would still have worked if Bathsheba had commented to Frank, ""Oh, you keep my hair in your watch.""  Also, why would Bathsheba get jealous simply from watching a woman walk away from Frank?  In the book, she asks him who the woman she saw was right away.  In the film, she only asks him this at the end of the scene, after she has alienated him by her unreasonable jealousy.  Not to mention that the ending is rather depressing because not only is Gabriel's part much reduced, but anyone could tell that Bathsheba is in love with Frank.  In the book, she unconsciously loves Gabriel all along, and they have a very tender scene together at the end of the book.  In the movie, she seems to take him as a consolation prize, especially after she goes crazy over Frank's dead body.  The script also changes Bathsheba's character in certain scenes; presumably, to make her more appealing to a 1960s audience.  Not to mention that Mr. Boldwood in the film is far too cold to be the madman from the book.  He seems more like the villain than a victim of his illusions to me.In the final analysis, the 1960s Far from the Madding Crowd is a fairly enjoyable movie, but pretty poor as an adaptation of the book.",3,"Great Acting, Holey Script",1231977600,"01 15, 2009",2009,2513,"['When', 'first', 'watched', '1967', 'film', 'version', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'would', 'like', 'well', 'loved', 'book', 'had', 'read', 'review', 'movie', 'made', 'sound', 'would', 'be', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'acting', 'was', 'charismatic', 'even', 'characters', 'were', ""n't"", 'portrayed', 'exactly', 'literary', 'counterparts', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'picture', 'musical', 'score', 'scenes', 'were', 'extremely', 'well-handled', 'i.e.', 'Bathsheba', 'firing', 'bailiff', 'first', 'meeting', 'Frank', 'Frank', 'sword', 'demonstration', 'circus', 'scene', 'When', 'watched', 'again', 'sister', 'told', 'held', 'interest', 'something', 'usually', 'bored', 'old', 'movies', 'when', 'held', 'interest', 'too', 'fact', 'think', 'script', 'had', 'been', 'more', 'faithful', 'cast', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'best', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'adaptation', 'ever', 'Unfortunately', 'script', 'full', 'holes.Why', 'earth', 'would', 'Bathsheba', 'send', 'valentine', 'Mr.', 'Boldwood', 'provocation', 'Liddy', 'what', 'could', 'possibly', 'hope', 'learn', 'opening', 'coffin', 'know', 'Bathsheba', 'Fanny', 'have', 'blond', 'hair', 'movie', 'sister', 'realized', 'lock', 'hair', 'scene', 'omitted', 'film', 'crucial', 'book', 'would', 'still', 'have', 'worked', 'Bathsheba', 'had', 'commented', 'Frank', 'Oh', 'keep', 'hair', 'watch', 'Also', 'why', 'would', 'Bathsheba', 'get', 'jealous', 'simply', 'watching', 'woman', 'walk', 'away', 'Frank', 'book', 'who', 'woman', 'saw', 'was', 'right', 'away', 'film', 'only', 'end', 'scene', 'alienated', 'unreasonable', 'jealousy', 'Not', 'mention', 'ending', 'rather', 'depressing', 'not', 'only', 'Gabriel', 'part', 'much', 'reduced', 'anyone', 'could', 'tell', 'Bathsheba', 'love', 'Frank', 'book', 'unconsciously', 'Gabriel', 'along', 'have', 'very', 'tender', 'scene', 'together', 'end', 'book', 'movie', 'take', 'consolation', 'prize', 'especially', 'crazy', 'Frank', 'dead', 'body', 'script', 'also', 'Bathsheba', 'character', 'certain', 'scenes', 'presumably', 'make', 'more', 'appealing', '1960s', 'audience', 'Not', 'mention', 'Mr.', 'Boldwood', 'film', 'far', 'too', 'cold', 'be', 'madman', 'book', 'more', 'villain', 'victim', 'illusions', 'me.In', 'final', 'analysis', '1960s', 'Far', 'Madding', 'Crowd', 'fairly', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'pretty', 'poor', 'adaptation', 'book']",N/A

137020,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,0792836480,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","When the British film, ""Far From the Madding Crowd,"" a romantic drama based upon the 1874 book of the same name,Far from the Madding Crowd, by British Victorian author Thomas Hardy was released in 1967, it was neither a critical nor an audience favorite.  In fact, its only Oscar nomination was for the lovely resonant soundtrack, with grace notes of contemporaneous English folk songs, by Richard Rodney Bennett.Now, make no mistake about it: you are in, as they say, Hardy country here, in more ways than one.  The film succeeds in giving you a very strong taste of the time and place in which it is set.  It seems as if it must be a David Lean film, in its sweep, its beauty, and its coverage of many years.  It wasn't a Lean film.  But the Wessex countryside, as beautifully captured by director by John Schlesinger, with cinematography by director-to-be Nicholas Roeg, accurately depicts the physical look of the place - I've been there, and can tell you that.  Acres and acres of green meadows and fields, rolling hills, big sky.  The film also, as I suppose it must, follows the original melodramatic Hardy novel that is dependent on all sorts of far-fetched coincidences that may try the patience of most readers.People familiar with the Thomas Hardy novel have been known to object that Bathsheba was there portrayed as dark and dramatic in coloring, and we have in Christie, of course, a fair-haired blue-eyed blond.  I accepted Christie in the part immediately, and can't imagine another actress of the time who could have handled it better.The film represented a reteaming of the trio that had just had a big commercial success with the contemporary 1960's tale of swinging London,Darling: director Schlesinger (who would be named a Commander of the British Empire), screenwriter Frederic Raphael, and incandescent star Julie Christie.  It tells the tale of Bathsheba Everdene, (Christie), stubborn, and hot-headed; she has unexpectedly inherited a large, successful farm.  She initially tells her employees: ""I shall manage everything with my own head and hands.""  But in the matter of marriage, she is, willy-nilly, led by her heart.  Of course, she has three of the handsomest, most attractive suitors a girl could ever imagine: it's no wonder they quite turned her head.  As rough-hewn shepherd and knowledgeable farmer Gabriel Oak, we have Alan Bates.  (""Whenever I look up, there shall you be.  And whenever you look up, there shall I be."")As rich and handsome local landowner William Boldwood, we have Peter Finch, who also turned in a superb acting job: he won the National Board of Review's Best Actor award.As Sgt. Francis (Frank) Troy, who functions more or less as the moustache-twirling villain of the piece, we have Terence Stamp.  We several times hear the maids gossiping about Frank: that he has more women than he knows what to do with.  He has seduced one of them, only to realize he can marry the mistress; great suffering will ensue.  But it should be noted that he is consistently portrayed as a man who doesn't much care for women: he has joined the army just for starters.  And we are shown a few times that he is happiest in male company.Stamp was chosen as #59 on Empire Magazine's 1995 list of the hundred sexiest stars in film.  He must be considered a true London Cockney, by the classic definition: a person born within the sound of Bow bells, as he was born in Stepney, and lived, as a young child, on Canal Road, Bow, before the German World War II Blitzkrieg forced his family's evacuation.The man just is a heart-breaker.  I once saw him, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, after a retrospective showing of the film he'd made immediately before this one,Poor Cow [Region 2], directed by Ken Loach.  He was telling us he's just used his first movie earnings to buy his first classic Rolls Royce -- he called it a ""Roller,"" guess owners do - and he'd wanted to show it off.  But he'd been warned by friends that Loach, a fire-breathing socialist then as now - that director's never even gone Hollywood-- strongly disapproved of luxury cars.  So Stamp had had to be sure to park his new Roller far away, where it couldn't be seen by the director.  You could still hear the regret in his voice, 35+ years later.  Now, sources insist that he and Christie had a blazing off-screen romance during the filming of ""Far:"" supposedly it inspired the Kinks' classic hit ""Waterloo Sunset,"" with the line, ""When Terry met Julie."" Personally, I wouldn't care to go up against the Roller.But I loved this film from the moment I first saw it, and love it still.
