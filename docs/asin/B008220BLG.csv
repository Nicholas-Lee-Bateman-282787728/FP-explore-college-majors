1542496,APZAJ6LGXH02F,B008220BLG,Ace Reader,"[1, 2]","All my expectations have been met and exceeded in this totally entertaining paranormal/fantasy romantic comedy ""Warm Bodies"". This films screenplay is deftly written and directed by Jonathan Levine. He based it on the novel by the same name written by Isaac Marion who loosely based his novel on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"".Beware! (Spoilers dead ahead!)Our hero, ""R"" = Romeo (English actor Nicholas Hoult, known for his role as young Dr. Henry ""Hank"" McCoy/Beast, in 2011 X-Men: First Class), is out on the town hunting fresh human for dinner with his pack of fellow zombies. They all hunger particularly for human brains, but hunger mostly for the stimulating life-memories and emotions they experience when they eat their preys brains. This allows them to remember what it felt like to be alive. It's really gross but it works for this story.Our heroine Julie Grigio = ""Juliet"" (Australian actress Teresa Palmer, known for her tough (Number 6) alien role in 2011 ""I Am Number Four), is General Grigio's daughter. General Grigio is played skillfully by John Malkovich who has appeared in over 70 films. He's in charge of the walled zombie-free enclave where uninfected humans survive. He hates all zombies and wants them all destroyed. Leaving the protected zone, Julie leads a team of her fellow humans into zombie-land to find much needed supply's. They are surprised and attacked by R and his gruesome mob of hungry zombies killing many of her teammates, including her boyfriend Perry = ""Paris"" (Dave Franco) who is killed by R. While eating Perry's brains, R experiences the memories of his life with Julie. R instantly becomes infatuated with Julie and wants to protect her from the other zombies. I know this sounds macabre and really weird, but it's a good weird. It's good because it's sprinkled with humor, drama, and the crazy hope that this conflicted zombie will somehow come back to life. You want him to.The rest of this film focuses on the relationship that grows between R and Julie. Julie comes to appreciate and understand that her zombie-boyfriend is vastly different from all of his brethren. Slowly but surly, something powerful is changing inside him, and now also in some of the other zombies as well. R lets her go and Julie returns home to her worried father. R and his best zombie-friend ""M""/Marcus = ""Mercutio"" (American actor Rob Corddry, known for his role as correspondent on ""The Daily Show with John Stewart"")-(2002-2006), begin to realize they are all changing fast. They don't smell as corpse-like as they once did. The ""Bonies"" (flesh eating skeleton-looking zombies-beyond the point of no return), are beginning to notice them as prey for the fist time because of their changing sent. Armed with this new revelation our hero, R (using Perry's eaten memories), finds his way into the patrolled human enclave to find and warn Julie a zombie war is about to begin.""Warm Bodies"" is at times gory with zombie violence and some language. All zombie films are like this and this one is no exception. The pacing of this film was at times a little slow, but never boring. It moved right along keeping me entertained, intrigued, and dying to see how it was going to turn out for our unlikely couple. I enjoyed the paranormal romantic notion that love alone could cure a corpse from it's dead state. Only in the realm of paranormal, fantasy fiction can something so wild and crazy work as entertainment to tickle the romantic side of my brain. This story is predictable for the most part, and that's why I like it. Amazingly this story went exactly the way I wanted it too. ""Warm Bodies"" has a very satisfying warm ending.While watching this film it's upbeat, light-hearted soundtrack caught my attention immediately. Many famous musicians and bands contributed to it's sound including Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Guns N Roses, to name a few. Original score is by Marco Beltrami and Buck Sanders. I enjoyed the make-up special effects and the (CGI) skeletons were scary! I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys zombies and romance mashed together. Please excuse any typos or mistakes. I have zombie fingers.

Zombie movies, zombie shows, fast zombies, slow zombies, medical zombies, don't know why zombies... it's been a lot of misses with a couple of hits. This is a hit.Warm Bodies has the subtle sarcastic humor in the vein of Zombieland, but focuses on the plight of the zombie. Hoult delivers fantastically as the sensitive undead protagonist. The fact that the origin of the zombie apocalypse isn't identifiable due to your hero being unable to remember because he's slowly deteriorating is awesome. The storyline's great, simplistic but great. Don't hold your breath for special effects- the cgi is obvious and choppy. But the acting's spot on- though I don't like Malkovich being so uptight.

1542498,A3KA2MOVBHFWVR,B008220BLG,Adam,"[2, 3]","Warm Bodies mashes up three different genres, or four, depending on how you count them. The Zombie Apocalypse, the Romantic Comedy, and Shakespeare are all combined, with Paranormal Romance as a fourth genre, if you didn't find that obvious from the fact that a zombie apocalypse and a romantic comedy have been shoehorned into a Romeo and Juliet story, presumably so that any seventh graders will feel that their English course had some worth after all. The ending is an important aspect to considers, so, spoilers to follow.The ending is entirely different. Good ol' R&J; both die, alone with half the cast, according to Bill Shakespeare's original script. This time around, not only do neither the zombie guy nor the human gal die a horrible permanent death,  but the zombie actually recovers from his zombification. It's a Hollywood ending as the happy couple and everyone that you may have pitied at any point in the film lives happily ever after.This modification of the story allows the entire film it's strongest element: theme of the healing power of human connection. Originally, the zombies are disconnected -- they seldom touch, they have shrunken zombie pupils, they eat brains in order to experience humanity once again for a few moments. The ones who completely give up hope peel off their faces and become 'bonies,"" which are even worse, tougher zombies.The zombies' hearts start back up, symbolically spurred by the love connection between our two heroes, which proves that zombies can still connect without needing to eat brains. In the end, the zombies are redeemed, and they are connected once more. And, as a quick scenes towards the beginning points out, the whole zombie situation can be compared to the smart-phone-absorbed generation's lack of connection.This symbolism is great and all, but it runs alongside the plot, rather than constituting it or at least dovetailing with it. The actual plot is just driven by a few attacks from the bonies, which propel everyone to a final climax that never feels as fulfilling as the themes of the film. It would have been a better film if they had ignored the traditional Hollywood need for cardboard monsters in a zombie film, and relied both on the reveals of the importance of connection and on a little more satire of the teenage mindset (One particularly good line is something similar to ""does anyone else feel the same?"" A self-obsessed and wrong yet universal thought becomes a much more legitimate one when taken from a teenager's mind and stuck into a zombie's.Ultimately, it's a fun concept, but the film could have been better. It's just of the cutesy, quaint variety. Nice acting from the zombie lead and his best zombie friend, though. It looks like they enjoyed it.",4,"Great themes, but poor plot.

Then he meets a girl and gets to relive her boyfriends life by -er- eating his brains.  And everything changed for him.I love this.  I love that it was a little silly.

There were a few actions spots, but 90% of this film focuses on the relationship between the zombies and the humans (specifically the two protagonists on the cover). It was very preachy in a hipster, sociological/philosophical kind of way. If you decide to watch it, you'll know what I mean.Back to my point.. if you are a zombie/infection fan, you may be dismayed by the liberties the writers took. Talking, improved logic, working understanding of technology.. things of that sort that you just don't want to see in the walking dead or infected multitudes. Action sequences and scares are few and far between. And the ending and &#34;resolution&#34; leave a lot to be desired.

I sleepwalk but that probably doesn't count.  Anyway Warm Bodies is absolutely hilarious and often times unintentionally hilarious.  I mean come on, a young zombie man falls in love with a non-zombie woman he finds attractive and meets during a zombie strike?  He somehow struggles and fights through his seemingly permanent zombie ways and finds the strength to impress the girl of his liking, and I have to admit, the writing and characterization is good enough to impress me.  For a while it really *does* feel like a typical zombie thriller but with attempts for the young man to fight through and become normal all for the greater purpose of loving a girl.  Strange, isn't it?  Yup!Of course that leads us to the ending... ahem!  Bad ending.  Sorry but it is.  You can't have happiness at the conclusion in a movie like this I'm afraid.  Implementing happiness would mean I'm supposed to take a loving relationship between a zombie and normal lady seriously and I just can't do that I'm afraid!  I suppose you'd have to feel compassion for a zombie in order to believe in any sense of love.  I just take the entire film as tongue in cheek, but the ending makes me think the writers were going for something bigger and more impactful.Anyway I really like how the zombie guy holds the girl ""hostage"" and expresses his love in several different ways.  Of course all the girl really wants to do is get out of there and make a clean escape, but that's impossible due to the abundance of zombies everywhere.  Because the movie is so good and truthful to the zombie genre (in the beginning at least) you're still on edge and constantly wondering if the zombie guy will suddenly turn and bite the woman out of nowhere, and thus infect her.  I can't be the *only* one wondering if this would happen, right? I mean technically it's still a zombie movie, right?  Come on, I have to be right!  Let me be right. :)I really enjoyed it.  It's a breathe of fresh air from other zombie movies that always seem to focus on hordes of them infecting victims/invading cities and the regular people have to defend themselves and their friends/family, etc.  This is an original idea here, and I support originality anytime over generic writing!

1542552,A6WZVL0SRQAPY,B008220BLG,Brian Driver,"[1, 2]","For all of you who have been wishing - nay, craving - for a feel-good zombie movie, this one's for you: WARM BODIES scavenges several genres to bring you just the right touch of supernatural sentiment. It's a comedy wrapped in a romance wrapped in the slowly revitalizing flesh of not-quite-too-dead zombies.As you might have learned, WARM BODIES concerns the story of young R (get it? Arrrr-r-r!), who narrates his tale of transformation and rebirth with a little whimsy thrown in. It seems that some zombies - well, those who haven't yet reached the stage of skeletonization - are starting to notice changes in themselves. R (played by Nicholas Hoult ofJack the Giant Slayer) and M, his friend (Mmmmm....get it?) are beginning to realize they are experiencing thoughts and the desire to express them, though their mouths are not cooperating...just yet.It's in the midst of a minor zombie vs. humans battle at the start of the movie that an interesting thing occurs: not only is R's life spared by the woman looking at him through her gun sights (apparently due to his moonpie eyes...natch), but his consumption of her boyfriend's brain sparks romantic thoughts in HIM, and these tender thoughts drive R not only to want to get to know her better, but to protect her as well. When he escorts her to hisWall-E-like airplane home base, where we find he's been wrestling with the humanities for awhile: the plane is full of little human trinkets like snow globes and old vinyl LPs that he gathers along his semi-staggering wanderings.Well, of course, complications ensue. Most notably, it turns out Julie, the girl he has rescued (played by Teresa Palmer ofThe Sorcerer's Apprentice) is the daughter of the leader of The Human Army (or something LIKE that, anyway) played by a very humorless John Malcovich. Since the humans are hiding behind a rather HUGE wall in their efforts to stem their seemingly hopeless losing streak, it's going to be up to Julie and R to convince her dad that the ""warm"" zombies are changing, and worthy of saving.None of this really has to make sense; what does matter is that this pleasant movie just misses being a whole lot of fun. Director and writer Jonathan Levine, who based his movie on the book of the same name by Isaac Marion, has a lot of good comic stuff going on, but it tries so hard to be just a little violent, and just a little romantic, that it lacks just a little humor. It wouldn't have taken much to make it an off-the-wall comedy or an equally zany romance, but unfortunately it is just too little of each.For instance, having R and Julie meet under her balcony (R and Julie-t...get it?) is a nice, subtle touch, and having Rob Corddry co-star as M is good, too - but not much is done with those assets. Hoult has a great face, and some good comic sensibilities, but I felt he was being held back...probably unavoidably, as zombies can't really show much expression.

Why didn't I think of that?""  But then again, Mr. Shakespeare would only be so modest.  And his choice of words might be slightly different.So this story has been told before, so many times that you probably can't keep count.  It's the old corpse-meets-girl-corpse-loses-girl-corpse-gets-girl-back story.  But this story has a really nice feel to it, so even though you've seen it all before, it feels fresh, even though some of the characters may smell like rotting flesh at the beginning.And I really liked Teresa Palmer here.  She had that Amanda Seyfried thing going on; she kind of looks like her, and even though their acting styles are slightly different, they both are very solid actors.  And the rest of the cast is also very good, surprisingly good; usually, in films such as ""Warm Bodies"" the casting director and producer always seem to sacrifice acting talent because, well, they probably think that the demographic for a Zombie film doesn't care about acting.  They probably feel that the audience is as dead as the zombies on screen.  Luckily for us, this film does not make that common mistake.While this film is obviously a take on ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- note that the lead male's character here is named ""R,"" could it be short for ""Romeo""? -- the themes are somewhat different.  One theme that I picked up on here was:  ""The world becomes a better place one person at a time.  Or at least, one corpse at a time,"" I suppose.  There are other themes, such as ""Accept people for whom they are,"" but it doesn't come across as some lame public service announcement.  It is always done with humor.So, to Mr. Shakespeare I might say, ""Don't be so modest, and don't worry about your legacy.  They are safe for the ages.""  And to everyone else I'd say, ""Don't be a corpse.  Dig yourself up from the couch and go see 'Warm Bodies' in a hurry.  Or at least as fast as you are able to walk, being half dead and all.""

1542575,A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ,B008220BLG,Chris Kennison,"[1, 2]","Unfortunately you have to venture out in the cold to enjoy a movie entitled ""Warm Bodies"" and then you come to realize that the movie is mostly about `cold' bodies, the dead undead. Nicholas Hoult (""X-Men: First Class"" and the upcoming ""Jack the Giant Slayer"") plays a zombie with thoughts named R, a name given because he can only remember that his human name started with an `R'. We're introduced to his thoughts early on and we see his desire to be something better than the feeble-brained stumbling zombie that he is. That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know.Just when you thought that zombie movies would probably never go away, but would never do anything remotely original, ""Warm Bodies"" shatters that. The movie is a tremendously creative twist on the genre. The zombie with thoughts gimmick goes a long way for director Jonathan Levine, but the movie as a whole stayed routine and didn't try to push the envelope much further. That being said, the soul of this movie isn't in the plot lines that it tells, but the search for life.I'm not sure if ""Warm Bodies"" is intending a deep message among its dry humor and romance, but a deep message may be its biggest asset. As R goes about his everyday zombie routine, he stumbles across a band of humans looking for medication and in that band is Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer ""Take Me Home Tonight"", ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice""). R instant becomes infatuated with the obviously attractive, tough-willed and vulnerable Julie. As the two of them bond in some pretty strange ways, the movie becomes a healing type movie. It becomes a slow walk toward humanity and life. The movie, about zombies, makes a pretty clear message that in a way, we all have zombie traits. Whether it be walking through life on our smart phones or just not living fully while we are here, ""Warm Bodies"" shows that we are all zombies, at times.I'm not completely sure that ""Warm Bodies"" is a smash hit or anything. To me, the story was way too routine and not challenging enough. Yet, the human and not-so-human elements of the film are top notch. The one thing I will say for ""Warm Bodies"" is that this is the kind of movie that will have a cult following and years from now, people will still enjoy watching it. It's nice little film that has more heart than most movies deserve. Most importantly, it's a movie about living, reminding us all not to take that for granted.",4,dry humor and LOTS of heart,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,2401,"['Unfortunately', 'have', 'venture', 'out', 'cold', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'entitled', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'then', 'come', 'realize', 'movie', 'mostly', 'cold', 'bodies', 'dead', 'undead', 'Hoult', 'X-Men', 'First', 'Class', 'upcoming', 'Jack', 'Giant', 'Slayer', 'zombie', 'thoughts', 'named', 'R', 'name', 'given', 'can', 'only', 'remember', 'human', 'name', 'started', 'R', ""'re"", 'introduced', 'thoughts', 'early', 'see', 'desire', 'be', 'something', 'better', 'feeble-brained', 'stumbling', 'zombie', 'nutshell', 'need', 'know.Just', 'when', 'thought', 'zombie', 'movies', 'would', 'probably', 'never', 'go', 'away', 'would', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'remotely', 'original', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'shatters', 'movie', 'tremendously', 'creative', 'twist', 'genre', 'zombie', 'thoughts', 'gimmick', 'long', 'way', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'movie', 'whole', 'stayed', 'routine', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'push', 'envelope', 'much', 'further', 'being', 'said', 'soul', 'movie', ""n't"", 'plot', 'lines', 'search', 'life.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'intending', 'deep', 'message', 'dry', 'humor', 'romance', 'deep', 'message', 'may', 'be', 'biggest', 'asset', 'R', 'everyday', 'zombie', 'routine', 'band', 'humans', 'looking', 'medication', 'band', 'Julie', 'Grigio', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'Take', 'Me', 'Home', 'Tonight', 'Sorcerer', 'Apprentice', 'R', 'instant', 'becomes', 'infatuated', 'obviously', 'attractive', 'tough-willed', 'vulnerable', 'Julie', 'two', 'bond', 'pretty', 'strange', 'ways', 'movie', 'healing', 'type', 'movie', 'slow', 'walk', 'humanity', 'life', 'movie', 'zombies', 'pretty', 'clear', 'message', 'way', 'have', 'zombie', 'traits', 'be', 'walking', 'life', 'smart', 'phones', 'just', 'not', 'living', 'fully', 'are', 'here', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'are', 'zombies', 'times.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'smash', 'hit', 'anything', 'story', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'routine', 'not', 'challenging', 'enough', 'human', 'not-so-human', 'elements', 'film', 'are', 'top', 'notch', 'one', 'thing', 'will', 'say', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'kind', 'movie', 'will', 'have', 'cult', 'following', 'years', 'now', 'people', 'will', 'still', 'enjoy', 'watching', 'nice', 'little', 'film', 'more', 'heart', 'most', 'movies', 'deserve', 'Most', 'importantly', 'movie', 'living', 'reminding', 'not', 'take', 'granted']",N/A

A zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco) and thereby falls in love with Perry's girlfriend, Julie (Teresa Palmer). The movie is meant to be a bit scary, a bit funny, and a bit romantic, but I wasn't much scared, I didn't laugh, and the romance was stale and flatfooted.Julie and R jump into a sports car to escape from menacing zombies and skeletons. The top is down; it begins to rain. They drive into an abandoned, post-Apocalyptic suburban neighborhood. Julie is cold; she has to take off her clothes. She does so in front of R. Teresa Palmer is a very beautiful young woman. R is a frustrated teen zombie madly in love with Julie. The director does absolutely nothing with this scene. There's no special lighting; the camera doesn't show us Julie's beauty as desperate, lovestruck R would see it.There are multiple chase scenes, none of which make much sense. Julie sees her well-armed father in a convoy and does nothing to join him, but later escapes on her own to join him, a much riskier trip. Why didn't she go earlier? No explanation.If you're looking for a funny zombie movie, check out ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and ""Zombieland."" If you're looking for a fully realized romance between a living woman and a dead man, watch ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and ""Truly Madly Deeply."" If you like romances between women and monsters, see Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""King Kong.""""Warm Bodies"" isn't a bad movie. It has its moments.

well, i didn't bail, so i can tell you there is a plot twist of sorts that builds just enough momentum -- *just* enough -- to push the movie through the last half hour, at least after the ""balcony"" scene (this is where the whole shakespeare angle clicked, julie and R, get it?

1542623,A3DBUN9EMFMUV1,B008220BLG,"Elias B. ""The Atlanta Fried Critic""","[1, 3]","Attached to this film is a trailer for ""World War Z"", an adaptation of Max Brooks' excellent novel which looks to be a shoe-in for one of the year's worst films. Packed with overabundant CGI, a contrived plot, and seeming to be lacking in the depth that made the source material so great, it's pretty indicative of the current state of zombie films as a whole. What a relief it is, then, that ""Warm Bodies"" is one of the most charming and original takes on the sub-genre I've seen in a while, and something I would heartily recommend to anybody with an open mind.The plot, based on a novel by the same name, takes place from the perspective of ""R"", a young, attractive zombie with a witty inner monologue and desire to be more human. Enter Julia, a girl whom he lays eyes on after killing her boyfriend. He takes her back to his home (a refashioned airplane that looks like a hipster heaven), and slowly begins to become more human as his heart begins to beat again. Soon, this begins to spread like a virus among the zombie populace (ironic, I know), and they begin to regain consciousness. However, the humans still won't forgive and forget, and the real threat to both the zombies and humans, terrifying skeletal creatures called ""Bonies"", begin to pose serious problems. Will the seemingly doomed romance last?You'll be asking yourself that question throughout, which is what makes this film such a winner. Nothing is ever really certain, as it is an experience that is all at once refreshing and unpredictable. At any given moment, something seems as if it's going to go wrong with ""R"" and Julia, and you're left biting your nails in suspense not from horror, but from the desire to see the relationship work. This relationship is the beating heart of the film, and honestly, this is what makes it such an enjoyable watch.That said, it might not be for everybody. Much like many cult films (think ""They Live""), ""Warm Bodies"" can slow to a crawl just as much as it can speed up to a fever pitch. While some people, like myself, may appreciate the interactions between a human and a zombie, and the unique dilemmas brought about by those, others may find these to be slow and tedious. This is understandable, and I can't fault people for that. This isn't as peppy and constantly funny as the trailers may lead you to believe; its tone is more one of ambiguity, and for some, that may be too demanding.What everybody should appreciate about this quirky little piece, though, is the excellent acting on all fronts. Nicholas Houlten as the lead is a delight, his ability to balance out his inner monologue with convincingly ""dead trying to be alive"" acting proving to be a winning combo. Teresa Palmer plays an equally as convincing love interest, acting pretty much exactly how somebody falling in love with the living dead would act. Special props should be given to Analeigh Tipton, who plays a charmingly ditsy best friend to Julie, and John Malkovich (what is HE doing here?!) as Julie's literally militaristic anti-zombie father. The acting drives the film, really, and if one actor was replaced, it just wouldn't be as good.Tied to together with some neat cinematography, which is clever enough to ignore the lacking special effects, and a lovably atypical soundtrack, ""Warm Bodies"" is destined to be one of this generation's cult classics. Not for everybody, sure, but those who like it will adore it, and it may likely become one of their favorite films, and one of their favorite cinematic romances.Now, how did their hearts start beating again anyhow...?Overall: B",4,Breathing Life Into Zombies,1359849600,"02 3, 2013",2013,3575,"['Attached', 'film', 'trailer', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'adaptation', 'Max', 'Brooks', 'excellent', 'novel', 'be', 'shoe-in', 'one', 'year', 'worst', 'films', 'Packed', 'overabundant', 'CGI', 'contrived', 'plot', 'seeming', 'be', 'lacking', 'depth', 'made', 'source', 'material', 'so', 'great', 'pretty', 'indicative', 'current', 'state', 'zombie', 'films', 'whole', 'What', 'relief', 'then', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'one', 'most', 'charming', 'original', 'sub-genre', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'while', 'something', 'would', 'heartily', 'recommend', 'anybody', 'open', 'mind.The', 'plot', 'based', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'place', 'perspective', 'R', 'young', 'attractive', 'zombie', 'witty', 'inner', 'monologue', 'desire', 'be', 'more', 'human', 'Enter', 'Julia', 'girl', 'whom', 'eyes', 'killing', 'boyfriend', 'back', 'home', 'refashioned', 'airplane', 'hipster', 'heaven', 'slowly', 'become', 'more', 'human', 'heart', 'beat', 'again', 'Soon', 'spread', 'virus', 'zombie', 'populace', 'ironic', 'know', 'begin', 'regain', 'consciousness', 'However', 'humans', 'still', 'wo', ""n't"", 'forgive', 'forget', 'real', 'threat', 'zombies', 'humans', 'terrifying', 'skeletal', 'creatures', 'called', 'Bonies', 'begin', 'pose', 'serious', 'problems', 'Will', 'seemingly', 'doomed', 'romance', 'last', ""'ll"", 'be', 'asking', 'question', 'what', 'film', 'winner', 'Nothing', 'ever', 'really', 'certain', 'experience', 'once', 'refreshing', 'unpredictable', 'given', 'moment', 'something', 'going', 'go', 'wrong', 'R', 'Julia', ""'re"", 'left', 'biting', 'nails', 'suspense', 'not', 'horror', 'desire', 'see', 'relationship', 'work', 'relationship', 'beating', 'heart', 'film', 'honestly', 'such', 'enjoyable', 'watch.That', 'said', 'might', 'not', 'be', 'everybody', 'Much', 'many', 'cult', 'films', 'think', 'Live', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'can', 'slow', 'crawl', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'can', 'speed', 'up', 'fever', 'pitch', 'people', 'may', 'appreciate', 'interactions', 'human', 'zombie', 'unique', 'dilemmas', 'brought', 'about', 'others', 'may', 'find', 'be', 'slow', 'tedious', 'understandable', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'people', ""n't"", 'peppy', 'constantly', 'funny', 'trailers', 'may', 'lead', 'believe', 'tone', 'more', 'one', 'ambiguity', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'demanding.What', 'everybody', 'should', 'appreciate', 'quirky', 'little', 'piece', 'excellent', 'acting', 'fronts', 'Nicholas', 'Houlten', 'lead', 'delight', 'ability', 'balance', 'out', 'inner', 'monologue', 'convincingly', 'dead', 'trying', 'be', 'alive', 'acting', 'proving', 'be', 'winning', 'combo', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'equally', 'convincing', 'love', 'interest', 'acting', 'pretty', 'much', 'exactly', 'how', 'somebody', 'falling', 'love', 'living', 'dead', 'would', 'act', 'Special', 'props', 'should', 'be', 'given', 'Analeigh', 'Tipton', 'who', 'charmingly', 'ditsy', 'best', 'friend', 'Julie', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'what', 'HE', 'doing', 'here', 'Julie', 'literally', 'militaristic', 'anti-zombie', 'father', 'acting', 'film', 'really', 'one', 'actor', 'was', 'replaced', 'just', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'as', 'good.Tied', 'together', 'neat', 'cinematography', 'clever', 'enough', 'ignore', 'lacking', 'special', 'effects', 'lovably', 'atypical', 'soundtrack', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'destined', 'be', 'one', 'generation', 'cult', 'classics', 'Not', 'everybody', 'sure', 'who', 'like', 'will', 'adore', 'may', 'likely', 'become', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'one', 'favorite', 'cinematic', 'romances.Now', 'how', 'did', 'hearts', 'start', 'beating', 'again', 'anyhow', 'Overall', 'B']",N/A

Zombie movies are a dime a dozen right now. This charming little mix of action, horror, and a love story changes things up a bit. It provides a satisfying experience, yet left me surprised there wasn't more funny parts.""Warm Bodies"" tells the tale of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult). R spends his days wandering through an airport aimlessly. One day he saves a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) from an attack by the walking dead. The two become unlikely friends, which appears to restore R's humanity over time. Have they discovered a way to bring the zombie masses back to life?As a whole, ""Warm Bodies"" works. I have to say I was expecting more humor than I got. While it was funny, it fell short of delivering the grins trailers promised. Director / Writer Jonathan Levine did a great job with creating a bond between the two lead characters. However, Julie accepts the fact that R ate her boyfriend way too casually.The zombie carnage and gory imagery isn't downplayed anywhere near as much as one would expect in an adaptation of a young adult novel rated PG-13. There's plenty of scenes of the living dead eating dinner. Creatures called ""Bonies"" also offer a higher level of horror than what one would expect from a zombie romance / comedy.""Warm Bodies"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with 7.1 surround sound audio. The picture looks great and is clear. Unfortunately, the hi-def transfer exposes the distracting CGI limitations of the ""Bonies."" The audio experience is highlighted by great sound effects and a fitting musical score coupled with some relevant rock tracks throughout.The Blu-ray for ""Warm Bodies"" is packed with bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Jonathan Levine and Actors Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer. There are seven ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes which address everything from location scouting to casting and special effects. Teresa Palmer's home movies, acting tips provided by actor Rob Corddry, deleted scenes, gag reels, and a theatrical trailer round out the special features.Although ""Warm Bodies"" doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting, it's still an entertaining and warm film. It's a less campy and more serious mix of 1993's ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and ""I Am Legend.""

1542632,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B008220BLG,FNDNreview,"[1, 2]","The zombies are coming!  The zombies are coming!  Yeah, it's a cheap way to start a review, so if you decided to leave - it's understandable and you're forgiven (not really).  Never the less, zombie-mania is running rampant on television, the big screen, video games, novels, etc. - so much so that it would appear (for now, at least) that zombies have permanently embedded themselves on our media entertainment...and have no intentions of leaving us alone any time soon.  Now, there's not enough time in the day to recap the occasionally dull, often predictable history of the ""zombie"" or the massive amount of renditions they've portrayed over the years.  However, without their leg-dragging history, they wouldn't be enjoying their fruitful present - in the form of a number one movie at the box:  Warm Bodies.Like any previous flick with ""dead"" in the title or named Resident Evil, zombies always play the bad guys.  They eat brains and flesh, and are one of Hollywood's greatest villains of all-time.  However, Warm Bodies shows us another side of the zombie psyche - the active-minded protagonist.  Based on Issac Marion's novel of the same name, the film stars Nicholas Hoult as R, a youthful zombie living in a post-apocalyptic city.  As most zombies do, he spends his days slowly wondering about looking for flesh - when one day he and his friends stumble upon a group of humans gathering supplies.  Among the humans is Julie (Teresa Palmer), and it's love at first sight for R.  The problem is he's still a zombie and she's a human - not to mention the daughter of the anti-zombie movement's leader (John Malkovich).  Rob Corddry and Analeigh Tipton also star in supporting roles.For a character having only a few lines to utter, Nicholas Hoult manages to work his eyes and body movements in a way that allows him to stay true to the motions of a typical zombie.  His co-star love interest, Teresa Palmer - dubbed a Kristin Stewart look-a-like, dominates the majority of the dialogue and will make you wish it were her playing the lead in the Twilight films instead of Stewart.  Together, Hoult and Palmer are engaging and memorable due largely to Jonathan Levine's writing and directing.  His character's are thoughtful and witty, while his directing ability is undoubtedly effective.  He manages to keep the flow of entertainment perfectly balanced and there's very little doubt he has a future cult-classic on his hands.If you happen to get a brief look at this film - whether it's from a trailer, TV spot, or other clip - this film comes off as a pretty hokey idea.  However, the rule of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" absolutely applies to this film.  If there's one word to describe this film, it's plain and simply ENJOYABLE.  Zombie films aren't for everyone, but this film really does have a little something for everyone.  For the most part, it's family-friendly with the core of the story focusing on the unconventional love story between a human and a zombie - playing off a Beauty and the Beast style of fairy tale.  A new breed of zombies serves as the villain in this film, making for some action and suspense.  And, there's plenty of lighthearted comedy to keep you laughing.To be honest, it's about time something new was done in the world of zombies.  These days, too much of the zombie entertainment looks and feels like Resident Evil or The Walking Dead.  Easily one of the best zombie encounters in recent memory, Warm Bodies will remind you of the charm and wit in Shaun of the Dead, while still maintaining those core principles of brain-eating and lousy make-up.  Regardless, if you're on the fence about seeing this film, consider this the push you've been waiting for to go see it.

1542645,A1X15AQVSCKKRG,B008220BLG,GreatMovieCriticForever,"[2, 4]","(Possible spoilers)This is a zombie romantic comedy.  Zombie comedies in themselves are still a brand new genre imo, but try a zombie romantic comedy , and that's still a relatively untouched genre. First movie that came to mind before I saw ""Warm Bodies"" was ""My Boyfriend's back"" from 1993. I loved that movie, and I definitely love this movie.Where to begin? It's extremely funny, but it does it in a way that it is natural and not scripted.The acting choices were great for this: Teresa Palmer,  Nicholas Hoult, Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry, and of course John Malkovich.Plot: Well the trailer does give away a lot of the movie.  A zombie named ""R"" (Hoult) is one of the few zombies that has been able to transcend his ""condition"" and actually is displaying some human interactions that he actually has made a connection with a beautiful girl named Julie (Palmer) whose part of a zombie resistance force.  They make an unexpected connection between themselves that will change their lives. Meanwhile Julie's father w Grigio (Malkovich) whose a top military person  does not share Julie's views that zombies can be capable of anything other than feeding on human flesh. To further complicate things  a group of zombies (?) called ""Bonies"" inhibit ""R""'s area and are looking for him.I know this is based on a novel but not reading the novel I judged the movie as a standalone feature (of course comparing it other zombie movies) and of course zombie lore in general.I know the great George Romero is one of the first directors that I know off that explored the ideas of zombies still retaining some human characteristics, and even still having their memories (though fragmented) still in them, so I was interested to see how this movie played that. I liked that the movie explored that fully.Jonathan Levine's direction is good.  All the scenes are setup very well for perfection.""R""'s progression starts very slowly (from the narration we get him from in the beginning to zombie grunts we come to expect from a dead corpse) then gradually it accelerates to where he actually perform speech very well and do other things. Likewise ""R""'s and Julie's relationship doesn't just fly off, but it grows gradually as well as we see how ""R"" is beginning to change because of her.Hoult and Palmer are absolutely perfect for their roles. They were both convincing and worked well off each other.The jokes in this movie are funny as hell. I don't remember any zombie movie where the zombie played music for a girl, or a zombie learns how to drive, or even offered a girl a beer!!!There's action and gore but it's  PG 13, so it's toned down, but that wasn't the real selling point of the movie. The selling point was the comedy and romance, and the movie definitely nailed it out of the park in that regard.The screening audience I saw it with laughed at every setup and every joke literally. There's some social commentary as well, and some nice little twists that kept the audience entertained till the very end.I really recommend it.",5,Great zombie flick with a different twist,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",2013,3026,"['Possible', 'spoilers', 'zombie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'Zombie', 'comedies', 'are', 'still', 'brand', 'new', 'genre', 'imo', 'try', 'zombie', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'still', 'relatively', 'untouched', 'genre', 'First', 'movie', 'came', 'mind', 'saw', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'was', 'Boyfriend', 'back', '1993', 'loved', 'movie', 'definitely', 'love', 'movie.Where', 'begin', 'extremely', 'funny', 'way', 'natural', 'not', 'scripted.The', 'acting', 'choices', 'were', 'great', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Analeigh', 'Tipton', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'course', 'John', 'Malkovich.Plot', 'Well', 'trailer', 'give', 'away', 'lot', 'movie', 'zombie', 'named', 'R', 'Hoult', 'one', 'few', 'zombies', 'been', 'able', 'transcend', 'condition', 'actually', 'displaying', 'human', 'interactions', 'actually', 'made', 'connection', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'named', 'Julie', 'Palmer', 'part', 'zombie', 'resistance', 'force', 'make', 'unexpected', 'connection', 'will', 'change', 'lives', 'Meanwhile', 'Julie', 'father', 'w', 'Grigio', 'Malkovich', 'top', 'military', 'person', 'not', 'share', 'Julie', 'views', 'zombies', 'can', 'be', 'capable', 'anything', 'other', 'feeding', 'human', 'flesh', 'further', 'complicate', 'things', 'group', 'zombies', 'called', 'Bonies', 'inhibit', 'R', 'area', 'are', 'looking', 'him.I', 'know', 'based', 'novel', 'not', 'reading', 'novel', 'judged', 'movie', 'standalone', 'feature', 'course', 'comparing', 'other', 'zombie', 'movies', 'course', 'zombie', 'lore', 'general.I', 'know', 'great', 'George', 'Romero', 'one', 'first', 'directors', 'know', 'off', 'explored', 'ideas', 'zombies', 'still', 'retaining', 'human', 'characteristics', 'even', 'still', 'having', 'memories', 'fragmented', 'still', 'so', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'movie', 'played', 'liked', 'movie', 'explored', 'fully.Jonathan', 'Levine', 'direction', 'good', 'scenes', 'are', 'setup', 'very', 'well', 'perfection', 'R', 'progression', 'very', 'slowly', 'narration', 'get', 'beginning', 'zombie', 'grunts', 'come', 'expect', 'dead', 'corpse', 'then', 'gradually', 'where', 'actually', 'perform', 'speech', 'very', 'well', 'do', 'other', 'things', 'Likewise', 'R', 'Julie', 'relationship', ""n't"", 'just', 'fly', 'off', 'gradually', 'as', 'well', 'see', 'how', 'R', 'beginning', 'change', 'her.Hoult', 'Palmer', 'are', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'roles', 'were', 'convincing', 'worked', 'well', 'other.The', 'jokes', 'movie', 'are', 'funny', 'hell', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'zombie', 'movie', 'where', 'zombie', 'played', 'music', 'girl', 'zombie', 'how', 'drive', 'even', 'offered', 'girl', 'beer', 'action', 'gore', 'PG', '13', 'toned', 'down', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'selling', 'point', 'movie', 'selling', 'point', 'was', 'comedy', 'romance', 'movie', 'definitely', 'nailed', 'park', 'regard.The', 'screening', 'audience', 'saw', 'laughed', 'setup', 'joke', 'literally', 'social', 'commentary', 'as', 'well', 'nice', 'little', 'twists', 'kept', 'audience', 'entertained', 'very', 'end.I', 'really', 'recommend']",N/A

Although my hoody would suggest I was unemployed.""I don't know that WARM BODIES reinvents the zombie genre. The back of my brain asserts that somewhen before was a similar premise. Diehard zombie purists should maybe stay away from this one lest they suffer a string of apoplexies. Me, I appreciate what WARM BODIES was going for, appreciate its going out on a limb. A zombie flick with a warm beating heart? Refreshing.Uniquely, our point-of-entry character is a rotter. Eight years into the zombie apocalypse, 'R' can't recall much of his past life. He posits that his name may start with an 'R'. We're right away alerted to the film's central conceit - that there may yet be a vestige of life, a spark of awareness, in these shambling revenants. R's wry internal monologue informs us of his loneliness and general sense of ennui and his regret at having to munch on humans but that, hey, he's gotta do what he's gotta do.Everything changes when R saves Julie (Teresa Palmer), a human girl out foraging, from an attack from his ghoulish peeps. The relationship they then fashion sets into motion events that irrevocably reshapes their post-apocalyptic world. That's if Julie's overprotective, militant dad (John Malkovich) doesn't fire a slug into R's brain. I know, right? Dads.If I had to bag on the movie, it'd be that Malkovich is woefully underused in it. Malkovich should've been allowed to dig deeper into his bag of tricks.WARM BODIES is very much a zombie comedy, and well-constructed. It does hold back on the gore, so the gorehounds will walk away seething. But I really liked it. Not only did I care about R and Julie, but I also grew invested in two ancillary characters - Julie's jaunty best pal Nora (Analeigh Tipton) and R's best undead pal M (Rob Corddry), with whom R engages in sessions of guttural ""dialogue"" at the airport bar. Corddry, in particular, is so good at what he does, it's gratifying that Jonathan Levine, who directed and wrote the screenplay, bestows upon M his own transformative story arc.And to present an alternative flavor, there's the action element. As R gradually continues to evolve and we glimpse a glimmer of hope, after all, there at the horizon for what's left of humanity, there is, as well, an escalation in dread and suspense as man's last outpost is threatened to be overrun by the Boneys, these skeletal reflections of the still fleshy zombies. Boneys are zombies who'd fully surrendered to despair and had sloughed off their skin and are become even more terrifying predators. In this undead hierarchy, regular zombies aren't the top-of-the-food chain alphas. In the DVD's bonus features, Nicholas Hoult describes the Boneys as ""kind of like the bullies at school."" Heh.If you've a literary bone in you, the allusions to Romeo & Juliet can't have passed unnoticed. At its most obvious, there are the two lead characters' names. There is even a balcony scene. I don't think anyone's trying to be subtle about it. A zombie story with Shakespearean underpinnings? I think the good folks at Merchant Ivory just developed their own boneys.It's cold to pan a movie that takes risks, so I won't. Besides, WARM BODIES took bold risks that mostly paid off. I relished the offbeat elements, the quirky humor that was individual to this film. It's good times whenever R tries to communicate with Julie only to be continuously trapped and frustrated by clich&eacute;d ""zombie speak."" There's hilarity but also pathos brought about by this dichotomy - of R's precise internal articulation versus his sad stabs at vocalization. Perhaps one of the film's best lines spools out of one such mortifying moment as R laments: ""This date is not going well. I want to die all over again.""Nicholas Hoult does a bang-up job of capturing the all-too-human awkwardness of crushing on someone even as he retains enough believability to sell his walking dead bits. Hoult projects a wistfulness and a way of being still that lend themselves well to the uniqueness of his zombie character. I wish he were even more in an advanced state of decay, but, hey, you have to give Julie something to work with. He couldn't be too revolting. Teresa Palmer, who was so badass as Six in I AM NUMBER FOUR, gets moments to show that she's still a captivating onscreen presence and still a girl to be reckoned with. And, yes, the bulk of the film's very best moments center around Julie and R interacting. It's such a peculiar love story, and I did spend much of the film wondering how in hell they were going to pull it off. How they pull it off is just one more grace note in a film that doesn't shy away from breaking conventions. A dead boy on a quest for true love, abetted by a kickass soundtrack? Yeah, man, I'm down.The DVD's bonus stuff:- Audio Commentary with screenwriter/director Jonathan Levine and actors Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer- 9 Deleted Scenes with Optional Audio Commentary with Jonathan Levine (totaling 00:11:10 minutes)- Shrug & Groan Gag Reel (00:05:07 minutes)- ""Boy Meets, Er, Doesn't Eat Girl"" - charts the development of Isaac Marion's novel and the film adaptation (00:09:49 minutes)- ""R & J"" - casting R and Julie and exploring their love story (00:16:20)- ""A Little Less Dead"" - about the acting ensemble (00:16:40)- ""Extreme Zombie Makeover!"" - about the make-up effects (00:10:10)- ""A Wreck in Progress"" - about the production design and set locations in Montreal (00:14:57)- ""Bustin' Caps"" - exploring the film's action elements - weapons and stunts (00:10:08)- ""Beware the Boneys"" - visualizing and rendering the boneys (00:07:03)- ""Whimsical Sweetness: Teresa Palmer's WARM BODIES Home Movies"" (00:12:37)- Zombie Acting Tips with Rob Corddry (00:04:43)- Theatrical Trailer",5,"""God, we move slow.

Boy, was I wrong.  Not only was it charming, witty, not dumb, and very, very well acted as well as produced very, very well, it had a performance by John Malkovich which was totally different from anything I ever saw him play.  In Zombie movies their is alway a fanatical, take no prisoners, kill everything in sight leader who at one point or another goes totally off the rails and starts butchering everything because it feels so good to him and gives him so much power.  Expecting this to be the type of character we were going to get, who would end up getting blown up or something, I was totally surprised when there were certain scenes in which the guy showed signs of being the leader, but not really knowing what he should do, so he'd ask for an opinion.  I'm not going to go into details because that would ruin it for you.  The film is really about the haves and have nots and that blasted 1% who wants to take over everything.  I totally loved this film and Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer were a sweet, sweet pair and their love story really drives the film.  Dave Franco is in it too, and as usual, he was tops.

In fact, in the supernatural beings canon (witches, elves, vampires, werewolves & other shapeshifters, succubi, mermaids . . um, ghosts, giants, poltergeists, angels, demons) . . .zombies rank as my least watchable. They're incredibly slow, and it's not like you can have a meaningful conversation with one. And the proclivity of theirs to eat my brain has to be their most off-putting feature, not to mention, their rotting stench and general decomposition.But this isn't a 'straight' zombie genre flick . . this is an affectionate lampoon crossed with a teenage Romeo and Juliet story. Sort of the kind of picture John Hughes made in the '80s, only 'John Bender' in this story is replaced by a charmingly self-aware zombie boy named 'R'. (At least, he thinks his name used to start with 'R' but that's all he's able to remember.) Even though he struggles to reproduce the most basic human language as he shuffles through his home--an abandoned airport inhabited by other members of the zombie nation--R carries on an amusingly self-deprecating and self-aware interior commentary about his current level of existence . . which is in a word, unsatisfying. One day, foraging for food (humans), R's zombie pod encounters Julie (Palmer) and her band of teenage commandoes on a supply-gathering mission. There's a firefight, but the teens come out the worse for it, being massively outnumbered. R. eats Julie's boyfriend's brain (""I'm not proud of it',"" he says ""But I can't help it--the brain is the best part."") When zombies eat the brains of their victims, they relive, for a brief moment, the memories of that person and thus get to feel human again for a moment. Thus, R. falls in love with Julie on the spot, and taking some brains to save for later, becomes her protector against his own . .er, kind.Julie just happens to be the daughter of the commander of the last remnant of human civilization (Malkovich), so this unlikely duo outstrips Shakespeare's original star-crossed lovers as a wildly inappropriate match. Julie is at first a frightened hostage . . but slowly begins to realize that R. is unlike any zombie she's been trained to expect. In fact, in her presence he is slowly regaining his humanity. Is it possible that the 'cure' for the zombie-virus is . . .love?An interesting premise gets dragged on a bit (okay, a lot) too long . . .the movie moves as slowly along as a zombie gait . .but our two leads are very appealing. Palmer is a rising Australian actress that will be unknown to Americans . . and Nick Hoult (Beast, X-Men First Class) has built an impressive resume stuffed with versatility since his debut as a child actor. People might not realize that this rangy youth is British, so effortlessly does he adopt the intonations and mannerisms of an American stoner (Zombie is really stoner taken to the ultimate level.)This ""Twilight for the Zombie Crowd"" is a ""fresh"" take on a genre that is anything but fresh.

They were traditionally walking aimlessly through an airport with dazed looks on their face, grunting to one another like your movie norm zombie, but then R (as he would later become known) could open an airplane door, play old records, and obviously at some stage the zombies have got the generators going and maintained the power to the airport.  Then, well I don't know if I'd say I worked it out but I guess I just accepted whatever goes, goes, forgot to question it any longer in my mind and I ended up really enjoying this film.  It didn't hurt that his human kidnap victim was smoking hot (played by Teresa Palmer).  There are moments watching this where you're thinking, well if they have a BMW and can drive it, why doesn't she just drive it away herself and return to the humans.  Or where would she have got a weedwacker from in an airport terminal?It's a situation light comedy. R eats the brains of the boyfriend of Julie, a hot girl who is part of a reluctant scavenger group and obtains bits of the boyfriend's memory including his fondness for Julie.  He kidnaps/saves her by rubbing blood over her alive scent and drags her back to the abandoned airport where the zombies reside, and his room (a powered up airliner) on the tarmac.  He wants to feel more human (which is why zombies particularly enjoy eating brains, they feel human from the memories) and to make Julie his girlfriend.  Julie wants to return to the human base, but is beginning to realise that zombies aren't just brain dead human eating machines that her father, the military leader of the compound, has portrayed them as.  Nicholas Hoult plays an interesting high functioning zombie, but it is really his zombie best friend M (played by Rob Corddry who bring the fun vibe to the zombie masses).This Amazon product page lists the DVD as having no features, but the one I watched had plenty, in fact combined they went for longer than the film.  There's deleted scenes and a gag reel of course but also a lot of features on the behind the scenes stuff in Montreal. Such as casting, playing the zombies, shooting the movie, finding an abandoned airport, interviews with the author of the book, bringing the book to the screen (it's well done enough that I actually want to read the book now).  Theresa Palmer also shot a lot of footage with her own camera while the movie was being made and there's a feature of that footage.  Rob Corddry again steals the scenes in all these behind the scenes features, Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult all seemed to be practical jokers and always having fun the whole time, making this features fun to watch. Interestingly everything was shot trying to push the limits but keep it a PG movie (although here in Australia it is rated M).  If you can a version with these features over a featureless DVD, it's worth the money.Warm Bodies is a refreshing spin on the same old zombie survival film we've become used to.

This actress bears an uncanny resemblance to a blonde Kristen Stewart.* John Malkovich (""RED"") is Julie's father, General Grigio, who heads the human defense forces in their walled fortress, fighting zombies and skeletors.* Dave Franco (""21 Jump Street"") is Perry, one of the armed defenders of the besieged humans. Yes, he's James Franco's younger (handsomer) brother.* Analeigh Tipton (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is Nora, Julie's friend.

1542693,ABQUJ3Z6EP5GN,B008220BLG,John's Horror Corner,"[2, 4]","This Romeo & Juliette approach to the zombedy breathes new life and a well-placed sense of hope into the genre.  While Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) succeeded in lighter-hearted, smiley approaches, neither conveyed the sense of romance-driven hope above desperation in their apocalyptic settings.  So see Warm Bodies!  You'll leave feeling hopeful.As ""R"", Nicholas Hoult's narration adds an inflexive zombie-perspective and comedic charm regarding the idiosyncratic behavior of animated corpses and, given the unique opportunity, their romantic proclivities.  The narration feels natural and unscripted as if you were watching a home video of yourself and Mystery Science Theater-ing it.  This nearly impromptu style reveals that he goes by ""R"" because he can't remember his name--only that it started with a zombie-grunting ""rrrrrrhu?""After introducing us to his daily lumbering grind, he rescues Julie (Teresa Palmer) from his ""friends"" and keeps her safe.  As he struggles to remember how to enunciate we learn that he has also clearly forgotten how to talk to a girl...since he has no memories of his life at all!  The mix of his awkwardly nigh-mute zombiism, his self-deprecating narrations (which are humanly articulate) and his high schoolish nervousness present an excellent platform to develop these characters and their relationship.Unlike Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, the gore was quite minimal.  There were no slow throat-tearing bites, flesh-rending or disembowelments by super strong zombie hands, which makes this ZomCom more watchable by those who don't care for shocking displays of gore of suffering.  This was a tasteful choice and, even as a gorehound, in this case I very much approve.I was really pleased with the music.  Songs like Bruce Springsteen's ""Hungry Heart"" and Jimmy Cliff's ""Sitting in Limbo"" mesh tongue in cheek irony with generally spectacular scoring decisions.  Not to mention playing ""Pretty Woman"" when R is receiving a ""human"" makeover, a great scene in which the stellar supporting character Nora (Analeigh Tipton) turns Hoult from zombie to hottie.The Shakespearian elements were not limited to the main characters' names:  R[omeo, perhaps] and Julie[tte].  Their relationship seems little less than ""star-crossed"" from the start, she learns not to fear or hate R as he becomes ""more human,"" her ex-cause-he's-dead boyfriend Perry is essentially Paris, Julie's father (John Malkovich) plays the lord of House Capulet role and he hates zombies as if they were Montagues, Nora plays Shakespeare's helpful ""nurse"" of House Capulet, and Marcus (Rob Corddry) does a heartfelt and transformative job filling the shoes of Mercutio.  There's even a balcony scene, which was the only unsubtle reference--but didn't feel forced.I generally enjoyed every aspect of this movie.  I have few small complaints and I'd rather not draw any attention to them.  This film is too good to chance scaring you off over minor quibbles.So go see this.

Two young people seem completely incompatible when they meet because they are from wildly different groups: he's a zombie, she's a human. She is with a group of young people scavenging supplies outside of the humans' walled-off city that is attacked by a group of zombies scavenging for brains. He's with the zombie group but is immediately taken by the sight of her (but after he eats her boyfriend). He helps her escape back to his home at an airport, where a lot of zombies shuffle around like the humans did years before. She lays low there and starts to appreciate him.His saving her is certainly odd for a zombie movie but the zombie mythology here is a bit different from the standard. The movie starts at the airport with him going through his daily routine of aimless wandering. While he does this, he provides a highly-articulate voice-over narration of his life and his memories, such as they are. He can't remember his name but thinks it began with an &#34;r&#34; so he goes through the movie as R. He can grunt and occasionally speak a word or two. He goes out with some fellow zombies on the above mentioned raid. Instead of his heart skipping a beat when he sees Julie, his heart has a beat. His physical heart grows stronger the longer he stays with her and he begins to speak more words, even sentences. Could this be the zombie cure?The other big difference from standard zombie lore is the two classes of zombies. First are the high-functioning, still human-looking zombies like R, who do have an internal mental process (the voice-over shows it in R's case and zombies like him have similar behavior). Second are the bonies, zombies who are blackened husks of their former human selves. They are vicious and unreasoning and eat anything that has a heartbeat. They are too far gone to be cured and turn on the first set of zombies when they show signs of a cure, i.e. heartbeats. The bonies are generic bad guys who are scary enough for a PG-13 movie.If you know Romeo and Juliet or one of its many imitators, the plot has no surprises. The departures from zombie lore are more surprising and interesting than the romantic plot. The performances are okay. John Malkovich plays Julie's father and he seems to be phoning it in for most of the movie. The two main characters are charming enough to keep the story going but are not outstanding. It was a mildly enjoyable film.Parental advisory: some language; very brief scenes of zombies eating people; shooting of both kinds of zombies but not with much blood or gore; some peeling/wounded zombies; a quick shot of Julie in her underwear from behind; some kissing.",3,Interesting ideas but only mildly enjoyable,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",2014,2736,"['Warm', 'Bodies', 'surface', 'transplant', 'Shakespeare', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'zombie', 'apocalypse', 'Two', 'young', 'people', 'seem', 'completely', 'incompatible', 'when', 'meet', 'are', 'wildly', 'different', 'groups', 'zombie', 'human', 'group', 'young', 'people', 'scavenging', 'supplies', 'humans', 'walled-off', 'city', 'attacked', 'group', 'zombies', 'scavenging', 'brains', 'zombie', 'group', 'immediately', 'taken', 'sight', 'boyfriend', 'escape', 'back', 'home', 'airport', 'where', 'lot', 'zombies', 'shuffle', 'humans', 'did', 'years', 'low', 'there', 'appreciate', 'him.His', 'saving', 'certainly', 'odd', 'zombie', 'movie', 'zombie', 'mythology', 'here', 'bit', 'different', 'standard', 'movie', 'airport', 'going', 'daily', 'routine', 'aimless', 'wandering', 'highly-articulate', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'life', 'memories', 'such', 'are', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'began', '34', 'r', '34', 'so', 'movie', 'R.', 'can', 'grunt', 'occasionally', 'speak', 'word', 'two', 'out', 'fellow', 'zombies', 'above', 'mentioned', 'raid', 'Instead', 'heart', 'skipping', 'beat', 'when', 'Julie', 'heart', 'beat', 'physical', 'heart', 'stronger', 'longer', 'speak', 'more', 'words', 'even', 'sentences', 'Could', 'be', 'zombie', 'cure', 'other', 'big', 'difference', 'standard', 'zombie', 'lore', 'two', 'classes', 'zombies', 'First', 'are', 'high-functioning', 'still', 'human-looking', 'zombies', 'R', 'who', 'do', 'have', 'internal', 'mental', 'process', 'voice-over', 'R', 'case', 'zombies', 'have', 'similar', 'behavior', 'Second', 'are', 'bonies', 'zombies', 'who', 'are', 'blackened', 'husks', 'former', 'human', 'selves', 'are', 'vicious', 'unreasoning', 'eat', 'anything', 'heartbeat', 'are', 'too', 'far', 'gone', 'be', 'cured', 'turn', 'first', 'set', 'zombies', 'when', 'show', 'signs', 'cure', 'i.e', 'heartbeats', 'bonies', 'are', 'generic', 'bad', 'guys', 'who', 'are', 'scary', 'enough', 'PG-13', 'movie.If', 'know', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'one', 'many', 'imitators', 'plot', 'surprises', 'departures', 'zombie', 'lore', 'are', 'more', 'surprising', 'interesting', 'romantic', 'plot', 'performances', 'are', 'okay', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Julie', 'father', 'be', 'phoning', 'most', 'movie', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'are', 'charming', 'enough', 'keep', 'story', 'going', 'are', 'not', 'outstanding', 'was', 'mildly', 'enjoyable', 'film.Parental', 'advisory', 'language', 'very', 'brief', 'scenes', 'zombies', 'eating', 'people', 'shooting', 'kinds', 'zombies', 'not', 'much', 'blood', 'gore', 'peeling/wounded', 'zombies', 'quick', 'shot', 'Julie', 'underwear', 'behind', 'kissing']",N/A

Thing is, he starts having thoughts besides eating brains and walking. He is dealing with this when he comes across Julie, a human whose dad is in charge barricading himself and the few remaining humans left. R develops feelings for Julie after eating her boyfriend's brains, which allow R to experience all of the memories. R decides to take Julie back to his place, a grounded plane, and keeps her safe from his friends. After a while she yearns for home, and they make the trip back to the compound.The ending of this movie was much better than the beginning. Pacing was definitely a problem, as the first 10 minutes felt like an hour, while the last 30 to 60 seemed like 10. I almost turned it off because there was not enough going on to keep me interested, but dealt with it as things slowly picked up.In this universe there are three types: Humans, zombies, and skeletons (bonies). The humans and zombies eventually join forces to defeat the bonies. Once the bonies are gone, the zombies somehow ignore their need to feed on human brains and instead live peaceably among them.

The acting is solid and the lead zombie's yearnings and confusions (he is aptly played by Nicholas Hoult) are convincing. Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing that Hoult also starred as young Marcus in About a Boy.There are many small moments of humor in this film, nicely inserted into the flow of events. There is also a cute scene that gives a nod to Romeo and Juliet. One caution: the zombie voices don't always result in clearly audible speech but that didn't happen often enough to irritate us. If you need to understand every word in a film, however, that isn't likely.The basic set-up: after an apocalyptic event, the world is left populated with zombies and humans, with the humans (led by the always watchable John Malkovich) determined to kill the zombies. The ""kill the zombies"" theme isn't anything new in the zombie genre so thankfully there is an added twist. I won't give spoilers about that although this site's photo doesn't leave much to the imagination about that. Even so, not every event is wholly predictable.I was particularly entranced by the actors in the film. Viewers may see parallels between zombie behavior and growing alienation, loss of identity, and lack of community in our society - and those parallels definitely increased my enjoyment of what might otherwise have been only a mildly diverting film.What may make or break this movie for viewers is the resonance of the zombie/human interactions. I never lost interest in those- or in any of the lead or minor characters. The plot also moved along at a decent pace and held my attention from beginning to end.

1542717,A2DCS39GFBJV24,B008220BLG,Kenya Starflight,"[0, 0]","I'll be honest -- when I first heard about this movie my reaction was ""Oh no, it's 'Twilight' with zombies.""  After seeing the various classic horror monsters be softened and turned into romantic male leads, I cringed at the thought of a zombie romance film.  The trailers warmed me up a little to the concept, however -- it seemed the film would be playing the concept for laughs rather than a straight romance, and I could see all kinds of potential for hilarity.  And after so many deadly-serious zombie films in recent times (""28 Days Later"" and the upcoming ""World War Z,"" for starters), it would be nice to have a comedic, tongue-in-cheek zombie film.I finally saw ""Warm Bodies"" last night, and to my surprise it's a lot better than I thought it would be.  It's not perfect and tends to fall into clich&eacute;s at parts, but it's a surprisingly sweet film that doesn't take its concept too seriously.Our protagonist is R, a zombie who lives in an airport and spends his days shuffling around, exchanging grunted conversation with a fellow zombie, and listening to music when he's not hunting for prey.  His mundane, undead existence is shaken up one day when, while on a hunt, he spots a beautiful girl among a group of survivors.  After eating her boyfriend's brains (a process that lets a zombie look into the memories of his or her victim), he learns more about the girl, Julie, and begins to fall in love with her.  At first she's put off by his attempts to woo and protect her, but gradually she realizes that though dead, he's not the monster she expected him to be.  And as their friendship develops, both realize that a remarkable change is coming over R... and that if they're to save both the undead and the rest of humanity from the Bonies (a race of skeletal super-zombies), they have to find a way to convince humanity that the undead can be saved.  If Julie's overprotective father doesn't put a bullet in R's head first...Yeah, the plot is essentially ""Romeo and Juliet"" in a zombie-apocalypse world.  (Even the protagonists' names, R and Julie, are a nod to the play that made me facepalm when I recognized it.)  But it's pulled off surprisingly well here.  Both young leads are good actors, and Nicholas Hoult does a superb job at playing R, somehow maintaining a slack-jawed ""zombie face"" and still managing to emote at the same time.  Teresa Palmer, as Julie, does well too as a young woman trying to maintain some sense of a normal life even as the world crumbles around her.  John Malkovich is surprisingly restrained in his role as Julie's father and the leader of the human resistance -- he could have played his usual hammy self in this film and not been out of place, but instead he chooses to play his overprotective, stubborn role straight.  This isn't a bad thing, just surprising, given that Malkovich is infamous for chewing the scenery in his films.I admit to not watching many zombie movies, but I know enough about the tropes and clich&eacute;s of the genre that I could catch the sly nods and winks the film makes toward the genre.  It actually has a feasible explanation for why zombies love human brains, and in his internal monologue R makes all sorts of wry observations about his kind (""God, we move slow"").  And it somehow manages to pull off the impossible -- a sweet love story between a zombie and a human -- without becoming overly sappy or ""Twilight-ing"" the zombie lead character.  It gets cheesy in parts, but that's part of the charm for me.And for those worried about excessive blood and gore -- this film is surprisingly light on the blood and guts for being a zombie film.  Your average episode of ""Supernatural"" is probably more gory.Both a sweet romantic comedy and a tongue-in-cheek look at zombie flicks, this film isn't going to win any Oscars, but it's still a fun and enjoyable flick.",4,Funny and surprisingly sweet zombie film,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",2013,3849,"[""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'when', 'first', 'heard', 'movie', 'reaction', 'was', 'Oh', ""'Twilight"", 'zombies', 'seeing', 'various', 'classic', 'horror', 'monsters', 'be', 'softened', 'turned', 'romantic', 'male', 'cringed', 'thought', 'zombie', 'romance', 'film', 'trailers', 'warmed', 'up', 'little', 'concept', 'however', 'seemed', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'playing', 'concept', 'rather', 'straight', 'romance', 'could', 'see', 'kinds', 'potential', 'hilarity', 'so', 'many', 'deadly-serious', 'zombie', 'films', 'recent', 'times', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'upcoming', 'World', 'War', 'Z', 'starters', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'have', 'comedic', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'zombie', 'film.I', 'finally', 'saw', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'last', 'night', 'surprise', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'not', 'perfect', 'fall', 'clich', 'eacute', 'parts', 'surprisingly', 'sweet', 'film', ""n't"", 'take', 'concept', 'too', 'seriously.Our', 'protagonist', 'R', 'zombie', 'who', 'airport', 'days', 'shuffling', 'around', 'exchanging', 'grunted', 'conversation', 'fellow', 'zombie', 'listening', 'music', 'when', 'not', 'hunting', 'prey', 'mundane', 'undead', 'existence', 'shaken', 'up', 'one', 'day', 'when', 'hunt', 'spots', 'beautiful', 'girl', 'group', 'survivors', 'eating', 'boyfriend', 'brains', 'process', 'zombie', 'look', 'memories', 'victim', 'more', 'girl', 'Julie', 'fall', 'love', 'first', 'put', 'off', 'attempts', 'woo', 'protect', 'gradually', 'dead', 'not', 'monster', 'expected', 'be', 'friendship', 'realize', 'remarkable', 'change', 'coming', 'R', ""'re"", 'save', 'undead', 'rest', 'humanity', 'Bonies', 'race', 'skeletal', 'super-zombies', 'have', 'find', 'way', 'convince', 'humanity', 'undead', 'can', 'be', 'saved', 'Julie', 'overprotective', 'father', ""n't"", 'put', 'bullet', 'R', 'head', 'first', 'Yeah', 'plot', 'essentially', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'zombie-apocalypse', 'world', 'Even', 'protagonists', 'names', 'R', 'Julie', 'are', 'nod', 'play', 'made', 'facepalm', 'when', 'recognized', 'pulled', 'off', 'surprisingly', 'well', 'here', 'young', 'leads', 'are', 'good', 'actors', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'superb', 'job', 'playing', 'R', 'somehow', 'maintaining', 'slack-jawed', 'zombie', 'face', 'still', 'managing', 'emote', 'same', 'time', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'Julie', 'well', 'too', 'young', 'woman', 'trying', 'maintain', 'sense', 'normal', 'life', 'even', 'world', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'surprisingly', 'restrained', 'role', 'Julie', 'father', 'leader', 'human', 'resistance', 'could', 'have', 'played', 'usual', 'hammy', 'self', 'film', 'not', 'been', 'place', 'instead', 'play', 'overprotective', 'stubborn', 'role', 'straight', ""n't"", 'bad', 'thing', 'just', 'surprising', 'given', 'Malkovich', 'infamous', 'chewing', 'scenery', 'films.I', 'admit', 'not', 'watching', 'many', 'zombie', 'movies', 'know', 'enough', 'tropes', 'clich', 'eacute', 's', 'genre', 'could', 'catch', 'sly', 'nods', 'film', 'genre', 'actually', 'feasible', 'explanation', 'why', 'zombies', 'love', 'human', 'brains', 'internal', 'monologue', 'R', 'sorts', 'wry', 'observations', 'kind', 'God', 'move', 'slow', 'somehow', 'pull', 'off', 'impossible', 'sweet', 'love', 'story', 'zombie', 'human', 'becoming', 'overly', 'sappy', 'Twilight-ing', 'zombie', 'lead', 'character', 'cheesy', 'parts', 'part', 'charm', 'me.And', 'worried', 'excessive', 'blood', 'gore', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'light', 'blood', 'guts', 'being', 'zombie', 'film', 'average', 'episode', 'Supernatural', 'probably', 'more', 'gory.Both', 'sweet', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'tongue-in-cheek', 'look', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'film', ""n't"", 'going', 'win', 'Oscars', 'still', 'fun', 'enjoyable', 'flick']",N/A

May,"[3, 5]","So you probably knew or read that the new film Warm Bodies is based on a young adult novel, and you thought to yourself, ""no way, not another Twilight."" Surprisingly, this film, while fine for young adults, appeals to the mature romantic in all of us as well.Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: First Class) stars as ""R"", the zombie with a non-beating heart of gold who does the unthinkable: he makes you swoon over a dead guy. R can't remember his name or anything about his past life, and he spends his days aimlessly roaming around an abandoned airport with his best friend, ""M"" (Rob Corddry - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart). He explains his sorry state of affairs via voice-overs, and we are immediately drawn in by his casual sense of humor about his sad circumstances. R is someone you would want for a friend.R has nothing to live for (pardon the phrase), that is until he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer - Take Me Home Tonight). Julie's father, Grigio, (John Malkovich - Con Air) is a powerful figurehead who leads the remaining, uninfected humans in preserving their mortality. They live in an army base while Grigio and other soldiers carry out nightly patrols, keeping an eye out for any corpses they may have missed.R, M and a group of their zombie buddies cross paths with Julie, her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco - 21 Jump Street) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton - Crazy, Stupid, Love) when they are on the hunt for their next meal. R tells us that he does not enjoy hurting people, and he would appreciate if you look away while he executes Perry for sustenance.While not overly graphic, we do get a few shots of R eating Perry's brains (including that which he saves in his pocket for later), but this is less gross and more symbolic, as R explains that he can absorb people's feelings and memories from their brain matter, much in the same way that cannibals believed they could absorb someone's power from eating their flesh. We are moved as opposted to disgusted as R lives vicariously through flashbacks of Perry's life, and he explains that even though he feels remorse for the way in which he feeds this insatiable need, this act allows him to feel alive again, even if only temporarily.R sees Julie and immediately falls in love. He saves her from his hungry friends by putting some of Perry's now dead blood on her face to cover up her live smell. This allows her to walk past the corpses without drawing attention (paging The Walking Dead).R leads Julie back to his ""home"", an abandoned airplane where he stores the items he collects on his aimless travels. Most prominently featured are R's records, which punctuate his feelings with the likes of Guns 'n' Roses and John Waite. When Julie asks why R prefers records to iPods, R responds, ""better...sound...""At first, Julie is afraid of R, but predictably she learns to trust him. She wants to go home, but R informs her it's not safe to leave right away, so she stays with R, passing time by teaching him some of human games and doing other cutesy things. The two grow closer, but how could they ever be a couple?R realizes that he is slowly being cured, and that it is Julie who is bringing him back to life. Though, when R and Julie's relationship starts giving the other zombies hope, what can at first be beautiful turns dangerous as they are not only escaping humans who don't believe in a cure, but they must also evade creatures known as ""Boneys"". Boneys live among the corpses, and they kill anything with a heartbeat without a second thought. This was never a problem for the corpses before because they never had a heartbeat, but now...Warm Bodies is a terrific date movie, and it is appropriate for young adults as well, as is evidenced by its PG-13 rating. It will leave you with a warm feeling and it might even make you cry. Warm Bodies has been cited by People magazine as ""the best zombie movie in nearly a decade.""

I struggled through Zombieland and I have yet to sit through the entire Shaun of the Dead movie.  But I am getting better so when Warm Bodies was released in theaters, I begrudgingly went...and was pleasantly surprised.  Nicholas Hoult is adorable (I know, not a phrase one wants to hear about a zombie) as R, the undead misfit who falls in love with Julie, the daughter of the leader of a group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse.  The movie ignores explaining the origins of the zombie plague in favor of creating a movie in the unique perspective of the deceased.R isn't your typical zombie, he's a loner who feels out of place among his undead compatriots existing in an airport.  He doesn't remember his life before he died, he doesn't remember how he died, and he doesn't remember his own name, but he knows he feels abnormal (even for zombie standards).  While on a &#34;food run&#34;, he encounters Julie, played by the pretty Teresa Palmer.  Julie is part of a ragtag group of survivors, all teenagers which begs the question, &#34;why send the hope of humanity out on a suicidal pharmacy run?&#34; who encounter the zombie horde.  R rescues Julie and takes her home, disguised as a zombie by smearing his smelly black blood on her face.  The rest of the movie is a thinly veiled twist on Shakespeares &#34;Romeo and Juliet.&#34;It's a clever movie, much better than the poorly executed book it was based on, and deserves to be seen.

Yes, there was comedy and sweet moments in the movie, however it was nowhere near the caliber of what everyone insinuated it would be like in their recommendations/articles. The acting in itself was good, the storyline for the most part was clever and witty. Most of the the things I disliked were small so I won't bother mentioning it because it probably made no difference to anyone else. My main problem with the movie was the actual zombies. In many scenes they did not behave like zombies. They behaved like a human who was trying to pretend to be a zombie. It was overdone and not believable. R (aka Romeo) and the other zombies supposedly started transforming back into people after R met the girl Julia (aka Juliette). However, by his own admission he listened to music and had limited words with a few of the other zombies prior to meeting her. That is not something zombies are supposed to do. I also found it weird that the zombies seemed to know their surroundings, and each other. That goes against the lore of zombieism.

On the cable's description, it's genres are comedy, sci-fi and horror. I didn't think this was a horror movie, but rather more a comedy satire movie. A satire to zombies and teen angst. Definitely a satire to teen angst. I was a little reluctant to watch this because of the possibility of being a horror movie. Now a days I get spooked pretty easily and was happy that this isn't a horror movie, but rather a little suspenseful.The story was original and it was a little funny at times with R's commentary. I think Rob Corddy brought more comedy to the movie. The way he performed as a zombie was funny. Interesting that only he and R have talking roles as zombies - even ""exhumed zombies."" And there is a moral story to this. Maybe a bit of a spoiler. But this was obvious and predictable even if it was original. The way to ""exhume"" Earth and cure it of zombies is to teach them to learn to love and what it means to really be alive.This was cute and I might be tempted to watch again some other time when I'm in the mood for a zombie comedy. Although, if I had to choose between this and Shaun of the Dead, I'd choose Shaun hands down.I did like R's commentary and I think I wouldn't have watched the movie if it wasn't done the comedic way it was.Oh and I liked how he even asked not to watch us eat the guy and that he was ashamed of it, making him seem more human than zombie.",4,Warm comedy of zombies,1382313600,"10 21, 2013",2013,1500,"['Warm', 'Bodies', '4', 'stars', '9733', 'think', 'maybe', '4', 'star', 'movie', 'one', 'least', 'originality', 'satire', 'cable', 'description', 'genres', 'are', 'comedy', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'did', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'horror', 'movie', 'rather', 'more', 'comedy', 'satire', 'movie', 'satire', 'zombies', 'teen', 'angst', 'Definitely', 'satire', 'teen', 'angst', 'was', 'little', 'reluctant', 'watch', 'possibility', 'being', 'horror', 'movie', 'Now', 'days', 'get', 'spooked', 'pretty', 'easily', 'was', 'happy', ""n't"", 'horror', 'movie', 'rather', 'little', 'suspenseful.The', 'story', 'was', 'original', 'was', 'little', 'funny', 'times', 'R', 'commentary', 'think', 'Rob', 'Corddy', 'brought', 'more', 'comedy', 'movie', 'way', 'performed', 'zombie', 'was', 'funny', 'Interesting', 'only', 'R', 'have', 'talking', 'roles', 'zombies', 'even', 'exhumed', 'zombies', 'moral', 'story', 'Maybe', 'bit', 'spoiler', 'was', 'obvious', 'predictable', 'even', 'was', 'original', 'way', 'exhume', 'Earth', 'cure', 'zombies', 'teach', 'learn', 'love', 'what', 'really', 'be', 'alive.This', 'was', 'cute', 'might', 'be', 'tempted', 'watch', 'again', 'other', 'time', 'when', ""'m"", 'mood', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'had', 'choose', 'Shaun', 'Dead', ""'d"", 'choose', 'Shaun', 'hands', 'down.I', 'did', 'R', 'commentary', 'think', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'watched', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'done', 'comedic', 'way', 'was.Oh', 'liked', 'how', 'even', 'asked', 'not', 'watch', 'eat', 'guy', 'was', 'ashamed', 'making', 'seem', 'more', 'human', 'zombie']",N/A

But I and they had a blast noting the clever parallels, thematic similarities, composites and send-ups of Shakespeare's classic. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy that plays like a comedy, and my kids enjoyed the humor in reading it, but hated both film versions they watched. This modernized fantasy analog had terrific comedy that won them over though, and happily for me as their teacher, a great deal of their pleasure came from being in on the jokes and twists because they had the Bard's version under their belts. Thank you, Jonathon Levine for this screenplay. You gave a high school English teacher a fantastic gift.

Confused?  Well, me too.  My first inclination was to stay away.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some zombies in film going back to the slow walkers of George Romero.In this take, a cataclysmic event has struck the world and turned most humans into the undead.  They appear to be just like your stereotypical zombies.  But there is also another zombie type.  One that has eventually eaten his or her own body parts and exists as a skeleton known as ""bonies.""  We learn this from our zombie hero known as ""R"" (excellent Nicholas Hoult).  He can't remember his full name but he thinks it begins with an R.  ""R"" is our guide and narrator and he's witty and smarter than your typical zombie.  He, along with his best zom-buddy ""M"" (Rob Corddry) communicate with a few grunts and groans and eventually they eke out a few words.While on a search for dinner they come across a gaggle of young humans, themselves out gunning for zombies.  Violence ensues and ""R"" manages to kill and consume one of the young men (Dave Franco).  One of the results of a zombie eating a human brain is the victim's memories float around in the zombies mind, kind of like a dream.  ""R"" sees a young woman (Teresa Palmer) who is also the girlfriend of his last meal.  About to be somebody's desert, ""R"" rescues her and takes her back to his home in an abandon airplane.As time moves on ""R"" develops feelings and a sense of responsibility for Julie (Palmer).  Something has stirred body chemicals and slowly, he is changing.  This is a surprisingly charming and funny movie probably aimed at the ""Twilight"" admirers.  But it also has a terrific script, a couple with true charisma and an interesting twist on the whole zombie genre.  Congrats to Jonathan Levine (""50/50"") for an excellent screenplay and wonderful direction...and a nice new year surprise.BLU RAY UPDATE:  The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good although there is some definite color alterations in the original film that carry over here.  The bad zombies (Boneys) look pretty lame in the CGI department and this transfer shows that detail more so than I remember in the theater.  The audio comes in a very nice DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.  It provides an immersive if not quite spectacular audio experience.  While the subs rumble a bit during the various zombie attacks the track is a bit short of perfection.

1542784,A14SRB2VNHKO3J,B008220BLG,"Nikki Kasakitis ""Nikki @ Foil the Plot""","[3, 5]","We've all heard that classic story about the star-crossed lovers. You know, the one where that guy falls in love with the girl and they must overcome impossible odds in order to be together. Warm Bodies is exactly that story, only with a twist; cause, well, he happens to be a zombie and she's still human. R (Nicholas Hoult) isn't your average zombie. Sure, he'll eat your brains and all, but at least he feels bad about it. Julie (Teresa Palmer) kills zombies and when her boyfriend is eaten by one, she's forced to put her life into his hands. Lucky for her, it's R. After saving her life, R and Julie form a special bond as she struggles to survive and he learns what it is to be human again. Slowly, they fall in love and manage to exhume hope for all humanity --- both alive and dead.Since first seeing the trailer for Warm Bodies, I knew it was a movie I had to watch. The fact that it's based off a popular book of the same name is just a sweet bonus. Warm Bodies is sort of a cross between Romeo & Juliet and Zombieland. Not quite a comedy and not quite a romance, it's a story that's about the power of human connections in a dead, desolate world. Levine has demonstrated an uncanny ability to bring poignancy and warmth to the most unlikely genre fusing zombies, humour and intelligence in to one satiating 97 minute showing. And though it is a zombie film, it's important to note that few of the a-typical zombie tropes stand. But fear not, because the deviations work and help to make the movie a big success.The best thing about Warm Bodies, though, is the cast. Hoult charms as the undead, love sick R and Palmer is radiant as the curiously bold Julie. Together they have a flirtatious chemistry that makes you believe the impossibility of their precarious relationship. Palmer reminds me of a young Natalie Portman both in looks and in spirit. She exudes that naive innocence and hopefulness that is so characteristic of Shakespeare's Juliet, while updating the performance with a bad-assery and curiosity that keeps you rooting for her. Hoult, on the other hand, is uber talented. I have a feeling he'll end up one of those underrated actors, much like Jesse Eisenberg --- so much potential and not enough credit but perhaps this movie will change all that. It's Hoult's charisma and the subtle nuances of his physical performance that make him the one to watch. He's engaging and funny and compassionate, everything you want in a modern-day Romeo.Warm Bodies also has a strong supporting cast, consisting of the funny Rob Corddry,  Analeigh Tipton of Top Model fame and the notorious John Malkovich. They each hold their own and do a decent job but it's clear why they're the supporting cast. They along with the Bonies sub-plot serve solely to move the storyline forward. Here Hoult is the star, carrying the picture from start to finish. It's hard to be original in the zombie genre, but Levine with help from Marion's witty screenplay, manages to keep it fresh, despite the masses of undead. The comedy is more of the observational kind, delivered mostly through R's inner monologue. Also, the use of music in the movie is incredibly ironic and perfectly timed, earning many a laugh from myself and the rest of the audience. All in all, I can sufficiently say that I adored this movie. There's no doubt about it, Warm Bodies is a zombie flick with brains and heart.Food for Thought: Warm Bodies is a quirky and unconventional zombie flick that will bring a beat to even the deadest of hearts. Rich with potential, this movie takes a tragic classic and turns it into a warm and hopeful rom-com, sans the traditional sap. Warm Bodies is funny, earnest and sweet with all the addictiveness of Twilight, only it's so much more well-executed. If the on-screen version is this good, I can't wait to see what the novelisation has in store for me next!",4,A zom-com with brains and heart!,1359936000,"02 4, 2013",2013,3865,"[""'ve"", 'heard', 'classic', 'story', 'star-crossed', 'lovers', 'know', 'one', 'where', 'guy', 'love', 'girl', 'must', 'overcome', 'impossible', 'odds', 'order', 'be', 'together', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'exactly', 'story', 'only', 'twist', 'cause', 'well', 'be', 'zombie', 'still', 'human', 'R', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', ""n't"", 'average', 'zombie', 'Sure', ""'ll"", 'eat', 'brains', 'least', 'bad', 'Julie', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'zombies', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'eaten', 'one', 'forced', 'put', 'life', 'hands', 'Lucky', 'R.', 'saving', 'life', 'R', 'Julie', 'form', 'special', 'bond', 'survive', 'what', 'be', 'human', 'again', 'Slowly', 'fall', 'love', 'manage', 'exhume', 'hope', 'humanity', 'alive', 'dead.Since', 'first', 'seeing', 'trailer', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'knew', 'was', 'movie', 'had', 'watch', 'fact', 'based', 'off', 'popular', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'just', 'sweet', 'bonus', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'sort', 'cross', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'Zombieland', 'Not', 'quite', 'comedy', 'not', 'quite', 'romance', 'story', 'power', 'human', 'connections', 'dead', 'desolate', 'world', 'Levine', 'demonstrated', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'bring', 'poignancy', 'warmth', 'most', 'unlikely', 'genre', 'fusing', 'zombies', 'humour', 'intelligence', 'one', 'satiating', '97', 'minute', 'showing', 'zombie', 'film', 'important', 'note', 'few', 'a-typical', 'zombie', 'tropes', 'stand', 'fear', 'not', 'deviations', 'work', 'help', 'make', 'movie', 'big', 'success.The', 'best', 'thing', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'though', 'cast', 'Hoult', 'charms', 'undead', 'love', 'sick', 'R', 'Palmer', 'radiant', 'curiously', 'bold', 'Julie', 'Together', 'have', 'flirtatious', 'chemistry', 'believe', 'impossibility', 'precarious', 'relationship', 'Palmer', 'young', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'looks', 'spirit', 'naive', 'innocence', 'hopefulness', 'so', 'characteristic', 'Shakespeare', 'Juliet', 'updating', 'performance', 'bad-assery', 'curiosity', 'rooting', 'Hoult', 'other', 'hand', 'uber', 'talented', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'end', 'up', 'one', 'underrated', 'actors', 'much', 'Jesse', 'Eisenberg', 'so', 'much', 'potential', 'not', 'enough', 'credit', 'perhaps', 'movie', 'will', 'change', 'Hoult', 'charisma', 'subtle', 'nuances', 'physical', 'performance', 'make', 'one', 'watch', 'engaging', 'funny', 'compassionate', 'everything', 'want', 'modern-day', 'Romeo.Warm', 'Bodies', 'also', 'strong', 'supporting', 'cast', 'consisting', 'funny', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'Analeigh', 'Tipton', 'Top', 'Model', 'fame', 'notorious', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'hold', 'own', 'do', 'decent', 'job', 'clear', 'why', ""'re"", 'supporting', 'cast', 'Bonies', 'sub-plot', 'serve', 'solely', 'move', 'storyline', 'forward', 'Here', 'Hoult', 'star', 'carrying', 'picture', 'start', 'finish', 'hard', 'be', 'original', 'zombie', 'genre', 'Levine', 'help', 'Marion', 'witty', 'screenplay', 'keep', 'fresh', 'masses', 'undead', 'comedy', 'more', 'observational', 'kind', 'delivered', 'mostly', 'R', 'inner', 'monologue', 'Also', 'use', 'music', 'movie', 'incredibly', 'ironic', 'perfectly', 'timed', 'earning', 'many', 'laugh', 'myself', 'rest', 'audience', 'can', 'sufficiently', 'say', 'adored', 'movie', 'doubt', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'zombie', 'flick', 'brains', 'heart.Food', 'Thought', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'quirky', 'unconventional', 'zombie', 'flick', 'will', 'bring', 'beat', 'even', 'deadest', 'hearts', 'Rich', 'potential', 'movie', 'tragic', 'classic', 'warm', 'hopeful', 'rom-com', 'traditional', 'sap', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'funny', 'earnest', 'sweet', 'addictiveness', 'Twilight', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'well-executed', 'on-screen', 'version', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'novelisation', 'store', 'next']",N/A

Warm Bodies, rated PG-13, is a hilarious look at what could be, a world in which humans are uncommon and zombies roam the land looking for fresh bodies to eat.This may not sound appealing, but according to KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven D, it's actually quite hilarious. And if you aren't squeamish about the idea of zombies, then you might consider this film for some mid-winter entertainment. As a quirky romance / comedy / horror film, it stands to remind us of the true meaning of humanity and the importance of staying connected with others.Raven's video review is available at kidsfirst dot org.The newest addition to the Zombie, Romance, Comedy and Horror genre. I call it, a Zombromance, or a Zomedy! It's set in a post apocalyptic world consisting of zombies, bonies and a small population of humans. When a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) meets a Human girl named Julie, he starts to feel like there is more to life than just being the walking dead. He begins to cure himself, retrain himself to talk and become more human. He inspires more zombies to try to cure themselves, and slowly they begin to become more human. Will R and Julie defy the odds and stay together, or will the fact that one of them is a zombie keep them apart?I absolutely adore this movie. I will definitely see it over and over again. When I think of zombie movies I think of nasty rotting creatures and lots of blood and gore. Naturally the zombies eat people in this movie, but it is filmed in such a way that brought a sense of humor to the whole thing and the blood was very minimal. Even the zombies don't look that bad. In fact, Nicholas Hoult makes one attractive zombie! I like the lighting and sets in this film a lot. You can definitely tell that it is a post apocalyptic world, but the zombies still try to maintain somewhat consistent routines. I thought it was cool too see zombie security guards and janitors. Although they weren't doing much, you still got the sense that there was some humanity left in them.My favorite character is R because he is such a sweetheart. He goes against his urge to eat people to save Julie and he proves that he is more than just a mindless flesh eater. Even though he is relearning how to speak, he is still quite slow so he can only mutter out simple words and phrases. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job keeping this character dull and Zombie-like, while still giving glimpses of his emotions and personality. This movie shows that R still has completely normal thoughts, he just can't express them, as if he is trapped in his own mind. R voiced over most of the movie and it was hilarious to hear what he was thinking, compared to what he was actually able to do. He made me laugh even in more intense situations, making him my absolute favorite character.I can't say I have a favorite scene because this whole movie is incredibly well done. I do love all the times that R and his Zombie friend M or ""Marcus"" interact. They try to communicate and connect and it's so funny and touching to see their friendship show even though it's challenging for them to express it. I also really enjoy the seen when Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) give R a makeover. R is so reluctant to have makeup put on him, which I thought was funny because most teenage boys are. The music in this scene was particularly funny and entertaining and it is a memorable scene.I think there are so many underlying messages in this film, but the one that stands out to me most is that we need to take the time to connect with our surroundings and the people in our lives. In this film it shows a flashback to the world before the zombie outbreak, and R is saying that back then everyone could connect, but in the flashback everyone is on their phones texting or playing video games. It is a really strong reminder that we are so wired and constantly tuned into technology that we often forget to be with our family and connect with our loved ones.I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because teens and even adults will love this movie, but kids under the age of 13 may find it to be too mature. I give Warm Bodies 5 out of 5 stars so go check it out.Reviewed by Raven D, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.Raven's video review may be found online at kidsfirst dot org",4,Is it a Zombromance? A Zomedy?

1542825,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,B008220BLG,RMurray847,"[0, 1]","For fans of zombie movies, the first thing you need to know about WARM BODIES is that it is rated PG-13.  This is very much not a movie about the gore, or brain eating or limb rending.  It's a gently amusing love story, which instead of featuring a couple that is mis-matched because one is rich and the other poor, or one is old and the other young, or one is a Capulet and the other a Montague, in this case one is a zombie and the other is still alive.WARM BODIES is a zombie movie for people who aren't necessarily big zombie movie fans or for big zombie movies fans who don't mind a zombie-mythology that isn't well explored (or even makes a lot of sense).  If you're a hard core fan who spends a lot of time parsing out the differences between Romero's zombies as opposed to the zombies in THE DEAD...or if you thought ZOMBIELAND made a mockery of your beloved genre...then stay away.  Otherwise, prepare for a  low-key, charming treat.We're introduced to our central character, a zombie named ""R"" as he shuffles around an airport full of fellow zombies and we get to hear his internal narrative.  He's our guide through all of this...so at no point is ""R"" a mindless, soul-less...well, zombie.  He's more like a human who is trapped inside the body of a zombie.  He doesn't really like to have to eat other people...but he does get a bit of a guilty charge out of eating brains, because he also eats their memories and feelings.  ""R"" was also a young man when he was changed...so when he bumps into an attractive, but living, girl named Julie...his romantic interest in her is far stronger than his desire to consume her.He leads her to his ""lair"" inside an old commercial airliner and insists she stay there for awhile, so he can keep her safe.  She complies, and the two forge an unusual but nicely touching friendship.  They little details of their courtship are quite fun, and in general, the best scenes in the film feature just these two together.  Relative unknown Teresa Palmer (SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE) is charming without being too sweet, and best of all is Nicholas  Hoult as ""R.""  Hoult first appeared on the scene as the dreadfully awkward kid in ABOUT A BOY (an overlooked classic, if you haven't seen it) but seems to have managed to escape the ""child actor"" blues and is forging a nice career for himself in young adult roles.  He's unconventional looking, and this helps his performance.  His ""R"" is soulful but also always looks slightly startled...as though he's expecting to be shot at any moment or is still stunned to find he is a zombie.  The chemistry these two share is terrific.The film is essentially their relationship...but because it's a medium budget film, it's also about trying to convince the ""powers that be"" on both sides that zombie/human love is okay.  In fact, the film is about how ""the power of love"" can overcome some pretty huge obstacles...not exactly a new message, but you've NEVER seen it play out in this scenario.  Major points for originality.I won't get into much more of the plot, except to say the film is at its weakest when attempting actions scenes.  They include some mediocre CGI and some undramatic confrontations between humans and zombies.  This is the only spot where the PG-13 rating hurts...the zombies never seem to do any serious damage.  The film simply doesn't generate much suspense in the more action oriented scenes.The supporting characters are quite minor, but standouts include Rob Corddry as R's best friend and quirky Analeigh Tipton as Julie's BFF.  Tipton, in particular, gets to have some fun late in the film.  However, the film also commits the sin of wasting John Malkovich.  Next to Christopher Walken, is there an actor alive who gives better crazy, zany, weird, wacky, etc.?  Well, Malkovich is asked to play things straight as the military leader of the humans...and in the end, all I did was hanker to see the upcoming sequel to RED, where he will no doubt steal the show once again.WARM BODIES is a gentle movie.  It doesn't have the over-the-top laughs of ZOMBIELAND.  It doesn't concern itself with homage as did SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  It simply takes zombies and explores what would happen if zombie weren't completely given over to mindless eating.  Few gut-busting moments...but many wry observations and sweet moments.  A date move for zombie lovers.

1542832,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B008220BLG,Roland E. Zwick,"[1, 1]","In the long annals of walking dead fiction, ""Warm Bodies"" is likely the first work to ever actually get inside the head of a zombie. And it turns out his thinking process is not all that different from yours or mine - if you can just get past that whole ""I want to eat your brains"" thing, that is.Skillfully written and directed by Jonathan Levine, ""Warm Bodies"" may not be the first attempt at a zombie-movie parody - ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Zombieland"" and ""Fido"" got there before it - but I'll bet it's the first to apply a ""Romeo and Juliet"" template to the genre (his name is ""R"" and hers is Julie, and there's even a charming balcony scene between the two to clinch the parallel).Nicholas Hoult plays a young walker who's been reduced to shambling aimlessly through the zombie-infested airport, playing vinyl records on the grounded jet he's converted into a comfy little ""home"" for himself, and mulling long and hard over what it means to be living out one's existence as one of the undead. He's not exactly proud of what he's become, but he's pretty much learned to accept it - that is until he devours the brain of Julie's boyfriend, thereby appropriating his memories and falling immediately in love with her. Our unlikely chivalric hero thereupon takes it upon himself to become the young woman's sole companion and protector as she tries to make her way through this dangerous and hostile world. And as Julie (Teresa Palmer) and R grow together in closeness and mutual understanding, R slowly but surely regains many of those precious qualities that once made him human.Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, Levine's screenplay, with its romantic tone and wry voice-over narration, is a subtle, gentle movie parody rather than a smart-alecky one on the order, say, of the ""Scary"" movie franchise or ""Date Movie"" and such. And it works beautifully from beginning to end, thanks in no small measure to the extraordinary chemistry between Hoult and Palmer in the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead).Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film. And the movie caps it all off with a coda that is about as sweet and uplifting as anything you're likely to see at the movies all year, guaranteed to make you feel proud to be a member of a species that, for all its faults, can still be pretty darn terrific when it puts its collective mind to it.It's nice to be reminded of that every now and again.",4,Now we know what all those zombies are REALLY thinking,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2013,2529,"['long', 'annals', 'walking', 'dead', 'fiction', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'likely', 'first', 'work', 'ever', 'actually', 'get', 'head', 'zombie', 'out', 'thinking', 'process', 'not', 'different', 'yours', 'mine', 'can', 'just', 'get', 'whole', 'want', 'eat', 'brains', 'thing', 'is.Skillfully', 'written', 'directed', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'first', 'attempt', 'zombie-movie', 'parody', 'Shaun', 'Dead', 'Zombieland', 'Fido', 'got', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'first', 'apply', 'Romeo', 'Juliet', 'template', 'genre', 'name', 'R', 'hers', 'Julie', 'even', 'charming', 'balcony', 'scene', 'two', 'clinch', 'parallel', 'Hoult', 'young', 'walker', 'who', 'been', 'reduced', 'shambling', 'aimlessly', 'zombie-infested', 'airport', 'playing', 'vinyl', 'records', 'grounded', 'jet', 'converted', 'comfy', 'little', 'home', 'mulling', 'long', 'hard', 'what', 'be', 'living', 'one', 'existence', 'one', 'undead', 'not', 'exactly', 'proud', 'what', 'become', 'pretty', 'much', 'learned', 'accept', 'brain', 'Julie', 'boyfriend', 'thereby', 'appropriating', 'memories', 'falling', 'immediately', 'love', 'unlikely', 'chivalric', 'hero', 'thereupon', 'become', 'young', 'woman', 'sole', 'companion', 'protector', 'make', 'way', 'dangerous', 'hostile', 'world', 'Julie', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'R', 'grow', 'together', 'closeness', 'mutual', 'understanding', 'R', 'slowly', 'surely', 'many', 'precious', 'qualities', 'once', 'made', 'human.Based', 'novel', 'Isaac', 'Marion', 'Levine', 'screenplay', 'romantic', 'tone', 'wry', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'subtle', 'gentle', 'movie', 'parody', 'rather', 'smart-alecky', 'one', 'order', 'say', 'Scary', 'movie', 'franchise', 'Date', 'Movie', 'such', 'beautifully', 'beginning', 'end', 'thanks', 'small', 'measure', 'extraordinary', 'chemistry', 'Hoult', 'Palmer', 'starring', 'roles', 'Rod', 'Corddry', 'equally', 'great', 'R', 'best', 'friend', 'living', 'dead', '.Corpse', 'corpse', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'ineffability', 'young', 'love', 'been', 'captured', 'so', 'winningly', 'film', 'movie', 'off', 'coda', 'sweet', 'uplifting', 'anything', ""'re"", 'likely', 'see', 'movies', 'year', 'guaranteed', 'make', 'feel', 'proud', 'be', 'member', 'species', 'faults', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'pretty', 'darn', 'terrific', 'when', 'collective', 'mind', 'it.It', 'nice', 'be', 'reminded', 'now', 'again']",N/A

This movie is fun, interesting, serious and humorous, with a touch of young cheesy romance. I would NOT call this a romance movie, however the zombie affection for the girl is interesting and yet also kind of cheesy, but they pull it off in this movie in a way that's passable.

'Warm Bodes' stars Nicholas Hoult (definitely one of the best actors, of his generation, working today) as ""R"" (he can't remember what his name was), a zombie in some future time when zombies have driven all the humans into walled fortresses of their own, who - even though he groans and slouches around and eats humans - still has a brain that can think and reason, to some degree.  R narrates the story, a functioning mind stuck in a zombie body ... until, during a particularly brutal fight between the humans and zombies, he catches sight of a beautiful young girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer), who literally makes his heart skip a beat - for the first time since he became part of the undead!  Unknowingly killing Julie's ex-boyfriend in the fight, R's nature takes over and he starts eating the dead guy's brains; eating brains is R's thing, and probably what's keeping him partially human inside, because in this film when a zombie eats a human's brains he/she also sees their memories; their hopes, fears and dreams.  R falls in love with Julie in that moment, and actually fends off the other zombies to pull her to safety, taking her to an abandoned airplane he's set up, at the airport, as his home.The more time he spends with Julie, the more human he becomes, and as he finally relents to helping her get back to her home and father (played by John Malkovich, and the leader of the walled city of people trying to kill off all the zombies), not only does R become more and more human again ... the change in him starts a chain reaction in the rest of the zombie horde, raising a possible hope for the future of the human race.This film is a comedy, zombie pic, bromance (R's best zombie buddy M, as played by Rob Corddry, is terrific - though I didn't buy him as a zombie as much as I did Hoult), and romantic tale of love conquers all; ultimately uplifting, and while not the perfect film I would hope that even those who aren't normally into zombie flicks will give it a go; it IS that good.",4,"Warm and engaging, thanks largely to the WONDERFUL Nicholas Hoult",1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,2147,"['Romantic', 'zombie', 'comedy', 'three', 'words', 'do', ""n't"", 'normally', 'see', 'together', 'when', 'describing', 'film', 'up', 'extreme', 'coolness', 'here', 'Bodes', 'stars', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'definitely', 'one', 'best', 'actors', 'generation', 'working', 'today', 'R', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'what', 'name', 'was', 'zombie', 'future', 'time', 'when', 'zombies', 'have', 'driven', 'humans', 'walled', 'fortresses', 'own', 'who', 'even', 'slouches', 'eats', 'humans', 'still', 'brain', 'can', 'think', 'reason', 'degree', 'R', 'story', 'functioning', 'mind', 'stuck', 'zombie', 'body', 'particularly', 'brutal', 'fight', 'humans', 'zombies', 'sight', 'beautiful', 'young', 'girl', 'named', 'Julie', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'who', 'literally', 'heart', 'beat', 'first', 'time', 'became', 'part', 'undead', 'Unknowingly', 'killing', 'Julie', 'ex-boyfriend', 'fight', 'R', 'nature', 'eating', 'dead', 'guy', 'brains', 'eating', 'brains', 'R', 'thing', 'probably', 'what', 'keeping', 'partially', 'human', 'inside', 'film', 'when', 'zombie', 'human', 'brains', 'he/she', 'also', 'memories', 'hopes', 'fears', 'dreams', 'R', 'love', 'Julie', 'moment', 'actually', 'other', 'zombies', 'pull', 'safety', 'taking', 'abandoned', 'airplane', 'set', 'up', 'airport', 'home.The', 'more', 'time', 'Julie', 'more', 'human', 'finally', 'helping', 'get', 'back', 'home', 'father', 'played', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'leader', 'walled', 'city', 'people', 'trying', 'kill', 'off', 'zombies', 'not', 'only', 'R', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'human', 'again', 'change', 'chain', 'reaction', 'rest', 'zombie', 'horde', 'raising', 'possible', 'hope', 'future', 'human', 'race.This', 'film', 'comedy', 'zombie', 'pic', 'bromance', 'R', 'best', 'zombie', 'buddy', 'M', 'played', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'terrific', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'zombie', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'Hoult', 'romantic', 'tale', 'love', 'conquers', 'ultimately', 'uplifting', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'would', 'hope', 'even', 'who', 'are', ""n't"", 'normally', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'will', 'give', 'go', 'good']",N/A

The names ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer) should clue you in. The film starts out with first person narration from ""R"", a zombie. He let's us know he can not connect with people, the theme of the film that zombies are simply people who have lost their connection to other people. If they can regain that connection, they can be cured or at any rate, not smell as bad.In this tale ""R"" consumes the brains of Julie's boyfriend and gains his memory. This starts a platonic relationship where they protect each other from each other's world. ""R"" is a horder who lives in a plane. Julie's dad (John Malkovich) is the leader of zombie killers. The introduction of young kids with pseudo patriotic themes is a satire of the ""Red Dawn"" movies.There are some questions that arise.1) How do the skeletons, i.e. ""bonies"" stay together without falling apart?2) How does a record player operate after 8 years into a zombie apocalypse with no electricity?3) How does a person see their own face in their own memory?This is a fun film, that drags at times.

The comedy is subtle and clever using such an absurdly surreal plot to full advantage with special emphasis on R's (Nicholas Hoult) inner monologue; great performance btw, I mean how exactly does one portray a conflicted zombie?  I also really enjoyed watching Teresa Palmer (R's love interest Julie) as she simultaneously plays sort of Resident Evilesque zombie fighter and the love-struck girl from next door.  I honestly doubt this movie would have worked without the addition of a fine supporting cast which is why i think it's noteworthy to mention R's zombified BFF (i.e. M played by Rob Corddry) as well as Julie's girlfriend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) and I can't leave out John Malkovitch as the disapproving father and last defender of humanity.Warm Bodies is NOT your typical zombie movie even though the director (Jonathan Levine) employs visual techniques common to the genre and despite the cover I wouldn't even classify it as a romantic comedy but rather an extremely original and quirky story that just may actually warm even the most cynical heart.  :o)",5,Refreshingly Original,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",2013,1171,"[""'m"", 'not', 'usually', 'sentimental', 'movies', 'love', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'movie', 'really', 'snuck', 'up', 'comedy', 'subtle', 'clever', 'using', 'such', 'absurdly', 'surreal', 'plot', 'full', 'advantage', 'special', 'emphasis', 'R', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'inner', 'monologue', 'great', 'performance', 'btw', 'mean', 'how', 'exactly', 'one', 'portray', 'conflicted', 'zombie', 'also', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'R', 'love', 'interest', 'Julie', 'simultaneously', 'sort', 'Resident', 'Evilesque', 'zombie', 'fighter', 'love-struck', 'girl', 'next', 'door', 'honestly', 'doubt', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'addition', 'fine', 'supporting', 'cast', 'why', 'i', 'think', 'noteworthy', 'mention', 'R', 'zombified', 'BFF', 'i.e', 'M', 'played', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'as', 'well', 'Julie', 'girlfriend', 'Nora', 'Analeigh', 'Tipton', 'ca', ""n't"", 'leave', 'out', 'John', 'Malkovitch', 'disapproving', 'father', 'last', 'defender', 'humanity.Warm', 'Bodies', 'NOT', 'typical', 'zombie', 'movie', 'even', 'director', 'Jonathan', 'Levine', 'visual', 'techniques', 'common', 'genre', 'cover', 'would', ""n't"", 'even', 'classify', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'rather', 'extremely', 'original', 'quirky', 'story', 'just', 'may', 'actually', 'warm', 'even', 'most', 'cynical', 'heart', 'o']",N/A
1542896,A3M2WW0PO34B94,B008220BLG,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[7, 11]","Now that Robert Pattison's big series is over, and he has yet to make a successful film not associated with brooding vampires or hunky werewolves, Hollywood is searching for The Next Big Thing among the pool of eligible young actors.Enter Nicholas Hoult. Hoult has been around a while, he was literal Boy in ""About a Boy"", starring Hugh Grant as figurative boy and Toni Collette. Now that he is in his twenties, the studios are making a little push to position him as the NBT. He is currently in two big releases, which is a good sign, but only one of them is worth your attention, which is problematic.It makes sense that Hoult is being groomed for this new role; he's British, not hard on the eyes and he can act. RPats shares two of these three qualities. Slam! Any Twihards reading this review have no doubt clicked ""Not Helpful"" provided they understood the slam. Double Slam!But back to the reviews. The first and better film ""Warm Bodies"" tells a modern ""Romeo & Juliet""-esque tale. But in this case R is a zombie (Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer, ""I Am Number Four"") is one of an ever decreasing group of humans. A few years ago, a virus began turning humans into zombies and this created a society with three groups, humans, zombies and Bonies - zombies who have gone to the next level and will eat both zombies and humans. A group of humans, led by Grigio (John Malkovich) have created a safe haven in the middle of the city, living behind patrolled walls. Grigio is a ""Shoot first and ask questions later"" kind of guy, doing anything to protect the lives of the people in his care. He is also Julie's father. Julie goes out on a supply run with her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and best friend, Nora (Analeigh Tipton). At the pharmacy, they are quickly overrun by R and a group of his friends. But R is instantly taken by Julie's beauty and feels his heart start to beat again. He pauses while eating one of her friends to appreciate her full Warrior Mode as she fights off his friends. The Bonies attack and R takes Julie to his home, an abandoned jet at the airport. R pleads with her to stay, for her protection, and they get to know each other.R quickly realizes he is changing-his expanding vocabulary is one sign-and he eventually convinces Julie of the change, hoping to gain her affection in the process. But they realize the change is happening in all of the zombies. Julie decides she should try to convince her dad of this, because the zombies could help the humans fight off the increasingly vigilant Bonies. R and Julie sneak into the barricaded area with the help of R's friend, M (Rob Corddry). All they have to do is convince her dad of the change, which is easier said than done.Directed by Jonathan Levine (""50/50""), ""Warm Bodies"" is a unique, amusing and entertaining film. There is a lot to like and appreciate about it and it just seems smarter and more involving than other tween romances featuring dark creatures.Much like ""Zombieland"", the filmmakers don't waste a lot of time. From the first frame, we meet R and listen to him talk about his current life as he walks aimlessly through the airport he calls home. As he introduces us to his world we see brief snippets of the past, much of it through news program headlines, giving us more than enough information to illustrate how the world got into this state. It is a fast and complete picture and doesn't slow down the narrative at all.The zombies are amusing enough because they are painted as victims, to an extent, who have to fend off attacks by both humans and Bonies. As they walk around, many still trapped in the meaningless jobs they had as humans, they are doing what they did in life, working to live. Now that they are real zombies, little has changed.The best thing about ""Warm Bodies"" is everything in and about the film seems very familiar. Two teens in love. Parents against it. But they fight for their love. It's a story as old as, well, Shakespeare. But Levine adds unusual elements and sets the story in an unexpected time and place. What this does is take the usual and make it different, exciting and unexpected. With so many cookie-cutter teen romances out there, it is refreshing to watch a film that takes the extra step to create an original and unusual story.It is also nice to watch a romance develop more naturally. It takes a long time, in the film universe, for Julie to accept R and fall in love with him. In so many films, it seems like someone flips a switch and the character changes. Julie is old enough, wise enough and weary enough to be resistant and make sure he is the right guy. Zombie or not.The addition of Rob Corddry is a nice touch. He plays M, another zombie who is R's friend, as much as they can have friends; he grunts in response to R's grunts and they spend a lot of time together. Given their age difference, it is a nice touch to make them friends, because their relationship seems borne out of convenience, another nod back to the human-as-zombie references populating this film. And when the change begins to happen, M is at R's side, ready to lead the fight against the Bonies.John Malkovich plays the leader of the humans, a no-nonsense type of guy who leads his people with an iron fist, unwilling to let anyone who may be infected into the compound. Grigio is a nice change of pace for the actor, showing once again he can take on just about any role and make it interesting.But Hoult is the real stand-out in the film. He brings a wide-range of skill to the role, giving R a lot of personality and interest. He always makes the zombie interesting, even before he starts to change and become more human. In the beginning he is more of a typical zombie, managing only monosyllabic grunts, moving slow, eating humans, looks like he just rolled out of a trash dumpster. But he is extremely introspective and we listen to him narrate his everyday existence.The more time he spends with Julie, the more he changes. As he grows closer to Julie, he tries to communicate and the words start to flow a little more naturally. It is much more difficult for actors to create interesting, viable characters without the use of their voice. Initially, Hoult has to use facial expressions to express his emotions. He can't even really use his arms or body language. It is an interesting involving performance making a good film even better.For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW. The sad thing is that the failure of these films is not always the actor's fault. Those that can act often get cast in bad films, or poorly marketed films. Cast him in a period costume romance and then a hard hitting urban drama. The tweens who made his first film a huge hit will surely follow and the success will follow. Or not.I think Hoult can and will rise above the failure of ""Jack""; he got many good reviews for ""Warm Bodies"", he had a small, but interesting role in ""A Single Man"", he was on the BBC version of ""Skins"". In other words, he can act. His agents and handlers just need to steer him away from some of the more iffy blockbusters. If a balance can be reached, Hoult can become a fixture of Hollywood. Hell, he might even end up seated next to Nicholson at a future Oscar ceremony.",4,"Fun, Modern Take on the tale of ""R"" and ""Julie""",1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,7439,"['Now', 'Robert',

1542898,ABLBRUT8DALNN,B008220BLG,Todd Smith,"[1, 1]","Love comes into play in almost every feature film you will ever see. It comes in many forms and often times, entire movies are centered on it. Those are basically the film that I loath, but Warm Bodies was different for the simple fact that it has everything! From love and romance to apocalyptic Science Fiction, this film has something for everyone! In this world, a virus has spread and left the world in ruins. Several human settlements still exist, but they are the food source and they are surrounded. The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling into the danger zone in order to find medicine for their settlement, when they are attacked. It looks like they're all done for, when a zombie named R sees one of the girls and decides to save her instead of eat her. For some reason this girl evoked emotion in R, which led to memories. Soon the other zombies in R's group start having memories and decide to convince the humans that they are changing. Are they really changing though or is it a ploy? Love is the cure is kind of a hoke concept, but it is our most powerful emotion and it seemed plausible that this feeling could evoke memories. Nicholas Hoult (forever known as that kid from About A Boy) stars as R and is terrific. It might not take a lot of talent to play a zombie, but to play one that is learning to be human again is no easy task. Hoult plays the part perfectly and is the reason this film is believable. John Malkovich is also in Warm Bodies and while he's not playing a hilarious bad guy, he still adds a different dynamic to the film, getting involved in much of the action sequences. Warm Bodies is a refreshingly unique story that will appeal to a large audience. The Walking Dead it's not, but it still has enough bite to keep the audience that's not into all the classic romantic stuff.

The romantic comedy with this outlandish premise is directed by Jonathan Levine of ""50/50"" fame. Though his curiously sweet ""zombie-meets-girl"" romance begins promisingly with effective offbeat humor, the film itself ends up with something more conventional than it should be.Based on an Isaac Marion book, the story starts with a flesh-eating undead ""R"" who remembers nothing about himself. He thinks he shouldn't be doing what he is doing, but cannot change himself until one day, during the combat with humans, R falls in love with a girl Julie and saves her. Things get complicated when he learns that Julie is a daughter of Grigio (John Malkovich), leader of a zombie-hunting vigilante group.The ""Romeo and Juliet""-like story (with a parody of the balcony scene) is told from the perspective of R, a zombie who seems to have some low-key sense of humor. The film is based on a concept that is stretched beyond its limits. Some of the processes R and other zombies go through are not explained. John Malkovich is wasted in an underwritten role.

He does, however, end up eating his boyfriend. You see eating brains allows these zombies to experience the memories of those they kill and that only adds to the allure of Julie. He saves her. The only problem is that her dad (John Malkovich) is the lead zombie killer for their protected community. With the support of her best friend (Analeigh Tipton who steals every single scene she's in--someone give her a starring role quickly), Julie faces the challenge of convincing her father the zombies need their help to become human again and stop killing them while avoiding the boneys--zombies so far gone that they are feared by the regular zombies--and her father just isn't buying it.END OF SPOILERS:As a combo genre film (romcom/horror) ""Warm Bodies"" could have been a disaster but the director and writer of the script do a very good job of balancing all of these elements with the comedy flowing naturally out of the story and characters.The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a detailed, rich presentation. There's a healthy amount of film grain and the cool colors of the film look very smooth. The Boneys--the main villains--are pretty scary looking although I feel that as good as they look, they could have been better integrated into the film. The lossless audio sounds marvelous with a terrific 7.1 mix that is very immersive.The special features include a terrific audio commentary featuring the director of the film and actors Hoult & Palmer. It's a fun, informative listen.There are a total of nine featurettes on the making of the film and they are informative covering everything from the airport the film was shot at to the creation of the creatures for the film. Actor Rob Corddry who gives a great performance as the friend of ""R"" (named ""M"")appears in the featurette on acting like a zombie. Corddry is a highlight of the film (and clearly deserves more screen time in films and, perhaps, his own TV series--he's a terrific character actor)and amusing.

1542909,AP1WE2DB14IL1,B008220BLG,"Whitt Patrick Pond ""Whitt""","[35, 48]","Directed by Jonathan Levine, from a screenplay he adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies is one of those weird cross-genre films - A romantic zombie flick? Really? - that has the potential to be either truly fun or truly awful.  Fortunately for everyone concerned, Warm Bodies is truly fun.  It's also a really well done film, the all too rare kind where the direction, the script, the actors, the cinematography and the make-up and effects, all mesh together perfectly and make the resulting whole far more than the sum of its parts.Set in a genre-standard post-apocalyptic near-future where the world has been overrun by zombies and what's left of humanity has retreated to fortress-like enclaves, the film begins with an inner monologue narration from the mind - or what's left of it - of a walking-dead boy (superbly played by Nicholas Hoult) named ""R"".  (He used to have a name but all he can remember now is that it began with an ""R"".)  In a hilariously deadpan stream of consciousness, he tells us about his existence - you can't really call it ""life"" after all - shuffling around an abandoned airport, bumping into other zombies, and periodically getting hungry and going off after the only thing zombies ever seem to eat - humans.  The only connection R has is to another zombie named ""M"" (Rob Corddry), who, like him, still possesses a flicker of brain activity:""This is my best friend. By best friend I mean we occasionally grunt and stare awkwardly at each other. We even have almost conversations sometimes. Days pass this way but sometimes we even find actual words, words like 'hungry' and 'city.' ""R also has connections to a handful of objects he finds - snow globes, vinyl records and such - and keeps in a derelict jet he hangs out in when he not busy shuffling around and going off to eat people.  He's not even sure why he keeps them anymore except that, now and then, they seem to stir some memory or echo of a memory in him. Which helps keep him from sliding further down the zombie slope, at the bottom of which are the ""bonies"" -  desiccated, skin-covered skeletons with no trace of humanity left.  ""They'll eat anything with a heartbeat,"" R tells us, immediately adding ""I mean, I will too, but at least I'm conflicted about it.""Not too far from the airport is a former sports stadium that a group of humans led by General Grigio (John Malkovich) has turned into a walled fortress.  Periodically they have to send out foraging parties into the city to scrounge for things like medical supplies.  Young people are recruited to be the foragers, mainly because they can run the fastest, an important survival trait in any zombie apocalypse. One of these parties that gets sent out includes Grigio's daughter, Julie (a very convincing Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco), and her best friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton).And as fate would have it, when R and M and a gaggle of other zombies go shuffling out of the airport in search of human flesh, they stumble across Julie and her fellow scroungers in an abandoned pharmacy.  During the fight, R ends up killing and eating Perry's brain (to be fair though, this was after Perry shot him).  As R explains, one of the reasons zombies are so drawn to eat brains is because by doing so, they experience, at least temporarily, the memories of the person they're eating.  It's the closest thing they can experience to being alive once more, hence their monomaniacal interest in craving brains.  And having eaten Perry's brain, the moment R encounters Julie and their eyes meet, he experiences Perry's love for her, immediately feeling compelled not to eat her but to save her, setting into motion a chain of events that will change them and everyone around them.There's a not-so-subtle undercurrent of Romeo and Juliet worked into the plot - sans most of the angst - which you can see in the names of the principal characters:  ""R"" for Romeo, ""Julie"" for Juliet, ""M"" for Mercutio, ""Perry"" for Paris (especially if you use the French pronunciation, i.e. Pa-ree), and ""Nora"", who wants to be a nurse, for The Nurse. It may sound a bit cheesy, but it's cleverly done and it works surprisingly well.The performaces are quite good for the most part. Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, X-Men: First Class) shines as R, managing to be appropriately dead-faced and shuffling as a zombie while allowing his flicker of humanity to be seen first solely through his eyes, then slowly and gradually becoming more expressive as his contact with Julie causes him to change.  Teresa Palmer (December Boys, I am Number Four) brings believability to Julie, showing a wary toughness that marks her as a survivor but also a willingness to see the changes in R and to respond to them. It also doesn't hurt that Palmer is actually athletic enough to make her running scenes look authentic - you have no trouble believing that this girl could indeed outrun a pack of hungry zombies. Rob Corddry (Hot Tub Time Machine, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) is subtly effective as R's fellow zombie M, in whom the changes being wrought are more visible and in some ways more keenly felt. On the slightly minus side, John Malkovich plays his General Grigio as something of a stock Malkovich portrayal, the kind you're familiar with from a lot of his movies, from Con Air and Red to Burn Before Reading. It's not bad, but you never get a sense that you're seeing anything but John Malkovich going through his paces. The film would probably have been better off with someone less well known in the role.For those of you who've read the book, the film follows the book reasonably closely.  The film is, I think, lighter in tone in a number of places.  Perry's role has been trimmed a fair amount to keep the focus on R and Julie.  And the hierarchy between the bonies and ordinary zombies isn't as clearly drawn.  The only reason I don't rate this a full five stars though is because of one significant difference in how the climactic confrontation plays out for the main characters.  I won't spoil anything by laying it out, but it'll be obvious to anyone who's read the book and I think the film would've been better if it had followed the book in this case.But all that said, it's remarkable at how well Warm Bodies actually works as a film. It stays true to the basic tropes of the zombie apocalypse genre, making it work for zombie-film fans, but also manages to blend in both comedic and romantic elements in a believable way, making it work in those genres as well.Highly recommended as, however improbable this must sound, a fun romantic zombie film that everyone can enjoy.",4,Zombie boy meets live girl - and doesn't eat her.

The central premise of the story is about a young male zombie simply known as R (played by Nicholas Hoult ofAbout a Boy) who despite his natural instincts to chow down on humans, rescues attractive zombie hunter Julie (Teresa Palmer). Thus begins a sweet, albeit unconventional love story of sorts as Julie's mistrust of the undead R gradually gives way to friendship and affection.I loved how the story blended horror elements with a love story and comedic bits. The leads were great especially Hoult who delivers a credible performance as the slacker zombie kid with heart who tries to come to terms with his inexplicable, against zombie nature romantic attachment to human Julie. This sexual attraction and affection for a human plays an important role in the story with far-reaching consequences in a post-apocalyptic world where masses of humans have been devastated by the zombie virus. Aside from the leads, the supporting cast also delivers fun and engaging performances - Rob Corddry as R's mentor/best friend is a hoot to watch, Analeigh Tipton as Julie's best friend, and John Malkovich as Julie's father and commander of the human army dedicated to eradicating the zombies.There really aren't scary bits in this film but the suspense quotient is respectable especially in scenes where the skeletors or boneys (zombies that are so far gone that they look like demonic animated skeletons) are on the prowl for victims. The story's central focus though remains the love story between R and Julie and it makes for a fun, and yes, sweet, sappy watch.",4,A fun zombie romance flick,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",2013,1698,"[""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'zombie', 'flicks', 'husband', 'convinced', 'give', 'try', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'Warm', 'Bodies', 'was', 'pleasant', 'surprise', 'central', 'premise', 'story', 'young', 'male', 'zombie', 'simply', 'known', 'R', 'played', 'Nicholas', 'Hoult', 'Boy', 'who', 'natural', 'instincts', 'chow', 'down', 'humans', 'rescues', 'attractive', 'zombie', 'hunter', 'Julie', 'Teresa', 'Palmer', 'Thus', 'sweet', 'albeit', 'unconventional', 'love', 'story', 'sorts', 'Julie', 'mistrust', 'undead', 'R', 'gradually', 'way', 'friendship', 'affection.I', 'loved', 'how', 'story', 'blended', 'horror', 'elements', 'love', 'story', 'comedic', 'bits', 'leads', 'were', 'great', 'especially', 'Hoult', 'who', 'credible', 'performance', 'slacker', 'zombie', 'kid', 'heart', 'who', 'come', 'terms', 'inexplicable', 'zombie', 'nature', 'romantic', 'attachment', 'human', 'Julie', 'sexual', 'attraction', 'affection', 'human', 'important', 'role', 'story', 'far-reaching', 'consequences', 'post-apocalyptic', 'world', 'where', 'masses', 'humans', 'have', 'been', 'devastated', 'zombie', 'virus', 'Aside', 'leads', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'fun', 'engaging', 'performances', 'Rob', 'Corddry', 'R', 'mentor/best', 'friend', 'hoot', 'watch', 'Analeigh', 'Tipton', 'Julie', 'best', 'friend', 'John', 'Malkovich', 'Julie', 'father', 'commander', 'human', 'army', 'dedicated', 'eradicating', 'zombies.There', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'scary', 'bits', 'film', 'suspense', 'quotient', 'respectable', 'especially', 'scenes', 'where', 'skeletors', 'boneys', 'zombies', 'are', 'so', 'far', 'gone', 'look', 'demonic', 'animated', 'skeletons', 'are', 'prowl', 'victims', 'story', 'central', 'focus', 'love', 'story', 'R', 'Julie', 'fun', 'yes', 'sweet', 'sappy', 'watch']",N/A
