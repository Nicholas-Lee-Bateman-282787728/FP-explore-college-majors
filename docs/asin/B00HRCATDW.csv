1691641,A3PIPHWD45VOGI,B00HRCATDW,Ace-of-Stars,"[1, 2]","What can you say about ""found footage"" style film making, except that you either love these type of movies or hate them.I seem to be that rare breed of animal where I fall on either side of the love/hate found-footage spectrum like the ebb & flow of the ocean, but there's usually some apparent consistency about it.As a standard rule, the more slow-paced and ""subtle"" these types of movies are, the more they tend to hold my interest (e.g. ""The Blair Witch Project""; ""Apollo 18""); whereas the more fast-paced and blatantly in-your-face such movies are, the more I feel like I'm being cheated and ""dumbed-down"" to (e.g. ""Apartment 143: Emergo""; ""Grave Encounters"").Another important element that often determines my level of acceptance and enjoyment of these types of films is their ability to allow me to suspend just enough disbelief to where I can almost envision these events as actually taking place in the real world -- hence why I seem to be in the vast minority in greatly preferring ""Quarantine"" over its original inspiration ""[&#9679;REC]"", or why I strongly feel that the follow-up to the excellent ""V/H/S"" should have never been made.So what makes ""Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones"" so different?The first ""Paranormal Activity"" (the *ORIGINAL* one, before Paramount butchered it to death with their sell-out ""Let's Guarantee That We Can Make A Sequel"" ending) was a ""just okay"" but attention-holding entry into the ""F-F"" genre, one that I'd actually like to revisit now that ""PA:TMO"" cleverly linked the two stories together (but again, I'll have to wait for the *ORIGINAL* version to be released on DVD... c'mon, Paramount!). Things rapidly went downhill from there with that dog-awful ""PA2,"" and I can only assume that it got worse from then on.But the premise of ""TMO"" seemed rather intriguing, and the few clips & previews I'd seen really sparked my interest, even though it was clearly being marketed as a loud and energetic offering. And upon actually watching the film I was completely drawn-in and hooked throughout the entire viewing. (*NOTE: this was one of those times where I'd not had the opportunity to view the movie prior to purchasing it, so I took what is now for me one of those very rare ""leaps of faith"" coming in to this one!)Even though they again sold it as a ""found-footage"" story, in keeping with the ""PA"" tradition, I found myself almost completely ignoring that aspect of it and was relating to it more as an entertaining movie in its own right... and that's what made this entry something of an exception, and exceptional, because I never found myself being distracted by the movie's mockumentary style, so there were no efforts made on my part to try to suspend disbelief and imagine the events as having taken place in any sort of ""real world"" setting: this was just pure ""sit down & get swept away"" entertainment, and the over-the-top elements are actually part of what helped make it for more enjoyable viewing, whereas if they had tried too hard to put on the pretense as so many other ""F-F"" type movies do it just might have lost me.",4,"An Over-the-Top ""Found Footage"" Tale I Actually LIKED!",1398902400,"05 1, 2014",2014,3084,"['What', 'can', 'say', 'found', 'footage', 'style', 'film', 'making', 'love', 'type', 'movies', 'hate', 'them.I', 'seem', 'be', 'rare', 'breed', 'animal', 'where', 'fall', 'side', 'love/hate', 'found-footage', 'spectrum', 'ebb', 'flow', 'ocean', 'usually', 'apparent', 'consistency', 'it.As', 'standard', 'rule', 'more', 'slow-paced', 'subtle', 'types', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'tend', 'hold', 'interest', 'e.g', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project', 'Apollo', '18', 'more', 'fast-paced', 'blatantly', 'in-your-face', 'such', 'movies', 'are', 'more', 'feel', ""'m"", 'being', 'cheated', 'dumbed-down', 'e.g', 'Apartment', '143', 'Emergo', 'Grave', 'Encounters', '.Another', 'important', 'element', 'often', 'level', 'acceptance', 'enjoyment', 'types', 'films', 'ability', 'allow', 'suspend', 'just', 'enough', 'disbelief', 'where', 'can', 'almost', 'envision', 'events', 'actually', 'taking', 'place', 'real', 'world', 'hence', 'why', 'seem', 'be', 'vast', 'minority', 'greatly', 'preferring', 'Quarantine', 'original', 'inspiration', '[', '9679', 'REC', ']', 'why', 'strongly', 'feel', 'follow-up', 'excellent', 'V/H/S', 'should', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made.So', 'what', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Marked', 'Ones', 'so', 'different', 'first', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '*ORIGINAL*', 'one', 'Paramount', 'butchered', 'death', 'sell-out', 'Let', 'Guarantee', 'Can', 'Make', 'Sequel', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'okay', 'attention-holding', 'entry', 'F-F', 'genre', 'one', ""'d"", 'actually', 'like', 'revisit', 'now', 'PA', 'TMO', 'cleverly', 'linked', 'two', 'stories', 'together', 'again', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', '*ORIGINAL*', 'version', 'be', 'released', 'DVD', ""c'mon"", 'Paramount', 'Things', 'rapidly', 'went', 'downhill', 'there', 'dog-awful', 'PA2', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'got', 'worse', 'then', 'premise', 'TMO', 'seemed', 'rather', 'intriguing', 'few', 'clips', 'previews', ""'d"", 'seen', 'really', 'sparked', 'interest', 'even', 'was', 'clearly', 'being', 'marketed', 'loud', 'energetic', 'offering', 'actually', 'watching', 'film', 'was', 'completely', 'drawn-in', 'hooked', 'entire', 'viewing', '*NOTE', 'was', 'one', 'times', 'where', ""'d"", 'not', 'had', 'opportunity', 'view', 'movie', 'prior', 'purchasing', 'took', 'what', 'now', 'one', 'very', 'rare', 'leaps', 'faith', 'coming', 'one', 'Even', 'again', 'sold', 'found-footage', 'story', 'keeping', 'PA', 'tradition', 'found', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignoring', 'aspect', 'was', 'relating', 'more', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'own', 'right', 'what', 'made', 'entry', 'something', 'exception', 'exceptional', 'never', 'found', 'being', 'distracted', 'movie', 'mockumentary', 'style', 'were', 'efforts', 'made', 'part', 'try', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'imagine', 'events', 'having', 'taken', 'place', 'sort', 'real', 'world', 'setting', 'was', 'just', 'pure', 'sit', 'down', 'get', 'swept', 'away', 'entertainment', 'over-the-top', 'elements', 'are', 'actually', 'part', 'what', 'helped', 'make', 'more', 'enjoyable', 'viewing', 'whereas', 'had', 'tried', 'too', 'hard', 'put', 'pretense', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'F-F', 'type', 'movies', 'do', 'just', 'might', 'have', 'lost']",N/A

Helsing,"[22, 31]","Don't let the negative Nancys scaring up highly critical, dismissive and sometimes mean-spirited reviews fool you: PARANORMAL ACTIVITY: THE MARKED ONES is an involving thrill ride that does not disappoint. Oftentimes filmmakers who take a creative risk with a successful series (in this case relocating audiences out of those haunted houses in previous PA films) result in criticism from viewers unwilling to be co-pilots with fresh characters on their spine-tingling adventures. This is a risk that delivers on all counts and provides plenty of scares in the process. One of this film's many delights is its sparkling cast. The chemistry between gifted newcomer Andrew Jacobs and charming veteran Jorge Diaz is one of the keys to this creepy film's success (which, as of this review, has already raked in over $80 million worldwide - pretty damn good for a $5 million budget). They are endearing and utterly believable as their lives are turned upside-down by their unwanted visitors' uninvited invasiveness. One of the bright lead's decent into supernatural madness is particularly heart-wrenching, making his journey all the more believable. And how refreshing for this gringo movie-goer to see an all-Latin cast bringing this winning entry in the franchise to life (Hollywood: take note!). The special effects, as always, are on a head-scratching ""how'd they do that???"" level. The supporting cast also gets high marks... as do the film's talented designers - turning real locations into unsettling streets and spook houses.

1691670,A146W4L7BDSL8V,B00HRCATDW,J. Pizzuto,"[0, 0]","What does it mean to be spooky?  The first two installments of the Paranormal Activity series were just that, and the reason is because those films imply demonic phenomena without explicitly revealing the enemy.  The first two films don't contain shots of, let's say, just for instance, witches running around or long-fanged monsters leaping out at the camera.  They also don't spell out the mysterious backstory of what is essentially meant to be an otherworldly, spiritual entity.  As the producers obtained larger budgets, it seems that they strayed further from the simplicity and mundane appeal of that earlier, less plot heavy, found footage format.  The lesson here should be clear:  Less is more.This is really Paranormal Activity:  Ethnic Edition!  It's a love letter to our growing population of hispanic immigrants and their children.  It's unfortunate that this attempt at an inclusive appeal didn't result in more favorable reviews.  If only we could get Immigration Reform pushed through so that America's hispanics can step out of the shadows and into the dimly lit theaters to show their support for highly stereotyped films such as this one.  According to these characterizations, hispanics are apparently poor, fatherless, frequently up to no good, prone to confrontation and violence, gang affiliated, in possession of illegal firearms, immersed in bizarre folk religion, and sexually promiscuous.  (Granted, the &#34;sexually promiscuous&#34; knock could be applied to many groups, not just hispanics.)There is a new twist on the &#34;invisible demon&#34; character.  Instead of being a separate and unseen entity, in the Marked Ones he/they more frequently appear to possess the main character, acting through him.  There are scenes where this character is initially thrilled by the newfound &#34;superpowers&#34; that the possession affords him, and for a few minutes you may wonder whether you're watching that other (better) found footage movie, Chronicle.The most genuinely scary part of the movie was when the group of teens were communicating with the demon via a battery powered game (a la the game Simon).  This scene was in the vein of any other Ouija scene, but I guess using Ouija has either been overdone or was judged to be too &#34;white&#34; or upper class for this movie; thus we get Simon instead.  The demon communicates using the device, answering the group's yes/no questions, until they ask it if it is &#34;good&#34;; this query alone receives no response.  Utterly predictable, true, but still unsettling.The plausibility of the found footage angle is stretched to the limit here, as it also was in Paranormal Activity 3.  In the original Paranormal Activity, use of the camera made sense, as the protagonist was aware of the presence and wanted to &#34;catch it&#34; in the act.  The camera there was stationary.  The camera(s) were also fixed in place in the second installment, where the host family had a home security system.  In this movie and the third installment, the cameras are largely handheld.  Even when the protagonists are in deathly danger, for some reason they still feel the need to point the camera in front of them.  One scene in the Marked Ones has a protagonist attempting to escape his would-be killers through upstairs windows that are boarded up.  Common sense would suggest that the odds of succeeding at this would have been increased had he had full use of both hands.  So...why not drop the camera?A final point of criticism again concerns the franchise's straying from what made the initial film work.

1691673,AFOHUSVNZZ49W,B00HRCATDW,K. Reynolds,"[0, 2]","WELL, HERE we are at the 5th &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; movie and, even though the scares &#8211; and the story &#8211; are dying, this franchise is going strong.Why? It&#8217;s cheap to make &#8211; about $5-million &#8211; and profits continue to be huge. Over $32-million-in-the-U.S.A.-huge. It&#8217;s probably safe to say we&#8217;ll see more of these.OK, I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m a sucker for the horror show. &#8220;The Conjuring&#8221; was one of my favorite movies of 2013, and I loved &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; 1 and 2. Even so, the thrill &#8211; and interest &#8211; began to wane at No. 3. Four was a yawner and five? Well, it&#8217;s hard to nod off with all the screaming, especially in the unrated, extended version. Truth be told, when one character finally drops dead, it&#8217;s a relief, especially for the ear drums. Also, it also means we&#8217;re very close to the end. Hooray.That&#8217;s what marks the difference between the theatrical release and the extended. More screaming, in case you wondered.&#8220;Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones&#8221; continues the demon-possession story set up in the first film. The difference this time: It&#8217;s set in a Hispanic community and follows the adventures of two best friends. The setting and characters were a happy surprise. They&#8217;re &#8211; sadly &#8211; unique. Afterward, the movie hits so many clich&eacute;s, it&#8217;s all downhill. Like my expectations.Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) has just graduated from high school, and has been gifted with a camera. He spends his time goofing around with best bud Hector (Jorge Diaz) without any apparent thought as to what he might do after graduation &#8211; like look for a job or go to college. An early activity has Hector sliding down a steep set of stairs in a plastic laundry basket, with Jesse filming. It&#8217;s a crash and burn with skinned knees and elbows and yelling. (Didn&#8217;t they already explore this activity pre-grade school?) Eventually, the plot starts to simmer in the scare department via a suddenly demented graduate from the same class and the bruja (witch), who lives in the apartment downstairs.It&#8217;s unfair to release additional plot details. The story is so simple, anything more risks serious spoilers, but, as a warning, you should know a little dog is tormented.The hand-held camera cinematography is still intentionally shaky and rough. It might be filmed in high-def, but never looks like it even on Blu-ray. Sound comes through cleanly &#8211; especially screams, as noted. One HUGE annoyance is a lack of subtitles for a character that only speaks Spanish. But I guess that would ruin the found-footage mystique.The only extra is a handful of deleted scenes. Were they in the extended version? It&#8217;s hard to tell; both versions are such nonsensical jumbles.We haven&#8217;t seen the end of the &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; franchise. That&#8217;s the scariest part about &#8220;The Marked Ones.&#8221; Am I too gullible to hope the next one will be better?Ah &#8230; that&#8217;s what the producers hope for.  &#8212; Kay Reynolds",2,More of the same - and not good,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",2014,3123,"['WELL', 'HERE', 'are', '5th', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', 'movie', 'even', 'scares', '8211', 'story', '8211', 'are', 'dying', 'franchise', 'going', 'strong.Why', '8217', 'cheap', 'make', '8211', '5-million', '8211', 'profits', 'continue', 'be', 'huge', '32-million-in-the-U.S.A.-huge', '8217', 's', 'probably', 'safe', 'say', '8217', 'see', 'more', 'these.OK', '8217', 'admit', '8217', 'sucker', 'horror', 'show', '8220', 'Conjuring', '8221', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'movies', '2013', 'loved', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', '1', '2', 'Even', 'so', 'thrill', '8211', 'interest', '8211', 'began', 'wane', 'No', '3', 'Four', 'was', 'yawner', 'five', 'Well', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'nod', 'off', 'screaming', 'especially', 'unrated', 'extended', 'version', 'Truth', 'be', 'told', 'when', 'one', 'character', 'finally', 'dead', '8217', 's', 'relief', 'especially', 'ear', 'drums', 'Also', 'also', '8217', 're', 'very', 'close', 'end', 'Hooray.That', '8217', 'what', 'difference', 'theatrical', 'release', 'extended', 'More', 'screaming', 'case', 'wondered.', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Marked', 'Ones', '8221', 'demon-possession', 'story', 'set', 'up', 'first', 'film', 'difference', 'time', '8217', 's', 'set', 'Hispanic', 'community', 'adventures', 'two', 'best', 'friends', 'setting', 'characters', 'were', 'happy', 'surprise', '8217', '8211', 'sadly', '8211', 'unique', 'Afterward', 'movie', 'so', 'many', 'clich', 'eacute', '8217', 'downhill', 'expectations.Jesse', 'Andrew', 'Jacobs', 'just', 'graduated', 'high', 'school', 'been', 'gifted', 'camera', 'time', 'goofing', 'around', 'best', 'bud', 'Hector', 'Jorge', 'Diaz', 'apparent', 'thought', 'what', 'might', 'do', 'graduation', '8211', 'look', 'job', 'go', 'college', 'early', 'activity', 'Hector', 'sliding', 'down', 'steep', 'set', 'stairs', 'plastic', 'laundry', 'basket', 'Jesse', 'filming', '8217', 's', 'crash', 'burn', 'skinned', 'knees', 'elbows', 'yelling', 'Didn', '8217', 'already', 'explore', 'activity', 'pre-grade', 'school', 'Eventually', 'plot', 'simmer', 'scare', 'department', 'suddenly', 'demented', 'graduate', 'same', 'class', 'bruja', 'witch', 'who', 'apartment', 'downstairs.It', '8217', 'unfair', 'release', 'additional', 'plot', 'details', 'story', 'so', 'simple', 'anything', 'more', 'risks', 'serious', 'spoilers', 'warning', 'should', 'know', 'little', 'dog', 'tormented.The', 'hand-held', 'camera', 'cinematography', 'still', 'intentionally', 'shaky', 'rough', 'might', 'be', 'filmed', 'high-def', 'never', 'even', 'Blu-ray', 'Sound', 'cleanly', '8211', 'especially', 'noted', 'One', 'HUGE', 'annoyance', 'lack', 'subtitles', 'character', 'only', 'Spanish', 'guess', 'would', 'ruin', 'found-footage', 'mystique.The', 'only', 'extra', 'handful', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'Were', 'extended', 'version', '8217', 's', 'hard', 'tell', 'versions', 'are', 'such', 'nonsensical', 'jumbles.We', 'haven', '8217', 'seen', 'end', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', 'franchise', '8217', 's', 'scariest', 'part', '8220', 'Marked', 'Ones.', '8221', 'Am', 'too', 'gullible', 'hope', 'next', 'one', 'will', 'be', 'better', 'Ah', '8230', '8217', 's', 'what', 'producers', 'hope', '8212', 'Kay', 'Reynolds']",N/A

Tresca ""Talien""","[7, 10]","It's hard not to get cynical about the teenage-oriented reboot of these sorts of films, and the changes are perhaps a side effect of getting older -- I couldn't help but notice that &#34;Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones&#34; is pandering to a younger, urban audience.  Where the first few entries in the &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; franchise played on the fears of a young couple and then on new parents, this fifth installment is all about the dangers of coming of age.&#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; began with a mysterious demon haunting a woman for no reason; &#34;Paranormal Activity 2&#34; extended that to a demonic cult dedicated to binding a demon to a first born child; the third installment was a flashback, but the fourth extended the conspiracy to a witch cult.  As you can see from the progression of the franchise, &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; keeps upping the ante, and by &#34;The Marked Ones&#34; we now have evidence of a global conspiracy to raise an army of demonically-possessed children.But I'm getting ahead of myself.  Suffice it to say that Jesse (Andrew Jacobs) hangs out with his buddy Hector (Jorge Diaz) after graduating, and in between smoking pot, hanging out with the hot &#34;only a friend&#34; Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) and filming really stupid stunts, they stumble upon a witch conspiracy that involves a murder and their valedictorian classmate, Oscar (Carlos Pratts). Whereas the earlier films used innovative, creepy techniques that played to the found-footage genre, &#34;The Marked Ones&#34; is content just to use a single camera.  THE SPOILER ONES: The Ouija board of the first film is replaced with a malfunctioning electronic Simon game, and tension is created through staring at curtains (not once, but twice) and bodies falling from the ceiling (not once, but twice). Mostly, &#34;The Marked Ones&#34; comes up with a few tricks that are a pale imitation of the original, and then uses them over and over and hopes you don't notice.What fans will notice is that &#34;The Marked Ones&#34; also wants to fill in the blanks of the other films.  The way it goes about this is heavy-handed, but then there are several plot holes that the script bulldozes right over, the most egregious being a magical door that lets you pop into any of the previous films.

1691688,AH0PI2S3O1YDP,B00HRCATDW,MonsterZeroNJ,"[3, 4]","The previous entry in this found footage franchise was widely panned as the weakest of the series even by fans and while I didn&#8217;t think it was as bad as it was made out to be, it was still the lesser of the series and was showing a franchise in need of either fresh ideas and more daring directions or a final chapter to wrap it up. The Marked Ones is definitely a good start back in the right direction and a spooky sign that these movies may not be done yet, if this is where things might be headed. Fans of this series will be happy to know that not only does this supposed &#8220;spin-off&#8221; get PA back on track but, is more reliant on actual scares than jump scares and answers a lot of questions that the other films have set up. It ties in perfectly with the previous entries and yet is it&#8217;s own flick. The movie starts out with friends Jesse (Andrew Jacobs), Hector (Jorge Diaz) and Marisol (Gabrielle Walsh) who live in an urban neighborhood and have a downstairs neighbor Anna (Gloria Sandoval) who is said to be a witch. One night this &#8216;witch&#8217; is murdered and Jesse and Hector&#8230; who are always filming things with a new camera&#8230; choose to sneak into her apartment and poke around. They find the woman&#8217;s journal and it does indeed seem to indicate this mysterious woman was into the black arts and was part of a witch coven seeking to build an army of demon possessed first born males. Jesse wakes up the next morning with a bite mark on his arm and things start to get weird and Jesse&#8217;s behavior starts to change with heightened aggression, strength and an almost supernatural ability to keep himself from harm. This causes Hector and Marisol to investigate further&#8230; which includes meeting with Ali Rey (Molly Ephraim) from Paranormal Activity 2&#8230; and they soon find that Jesse may have been marked by this coven since before birth to become the next soldier in this nightmarish army. Can they save him or will Jesse be damned like the others before him? Writer/director Christopher Landon answers that question&#8230; and many more&#8230; with a truly &#8216;crap you pants&#8217; finale following a fun and scare filled flick that is both familiar and fresh at the same time. He knows how to build scares and he does so slowly with a film that builds it&#8217;s momentum steadily till a really intense last act that leads up to one of the best horror movie endings in quite a while and a climax fans of this series will love from between the spaces of the fingers that are covering their eyes. Landon cleverly ties this flick in with the previous entries and we get references galore and revisit a few familiar settings as well. As for the return of any other familiar faces other then Ali, you&#8217;ll have to see it to find out. The cast are really good here. Our three leads are very likable and supply some fun laughs early on especially from Diaz&#8217;s lovable goof-ball Hector. Jacobs makes a solid leading man and we like Jesse and feel for him as it becomes obvious he is in deep supernatural trouble. The camaraderie between the three makes Hector and Marisol&#8217;s efforts to save him seem real and the risks they take believable&#8230; and messing with a demonic worshiping witch cult is risky, as we find out. So, in conclusion Christopher Landon has things back to form and even shows promise of more intense things to come. He makes good use of the found footage format which is far less obtrusive here then in the last flick and he has a nice visual style to add to the atmosphere. This is also the most violent entry in the series and one of the scariest since the first flick so, this film earns it&#8217;s R rating from more then just a few curse words and snapped necks. And if nothing else, Landon gives his Latino themed entry in this series a really great ending that will stick with you for a while after leaving the theater, especially if you are a fan. Now with Paranormal Activity 5 being released October 2014, let&#8217;s hope they can keep this new momentum going. It may still not attract any new fans to the series but, should rejuvenate the interest of fans disappointed by PA4.

They aren't calling this ""Paranormal Activity 5"" because it's basically a spin-off, not a direct sequel. Although you won't completely understand this movie unless you've seen the others.2. It's better than ""Paranormal Activity 4"". But that's not a compliment. Staring at the ceiling is better than ""Paranormal Activity 4"". This is still one of the worst movies of 2014. When a movie studio releases a movie two days AFTER the holidays, even they know it's crap.3. This movie is different than the previous installments in that it's not set among rich white people. It's set among poor Latino people (the main character is an 18-year-old boy named Jesse). Other than that, it's basically the same crap.4. It takes about 30 minutes for anything plot-worthy to happen. Before that, it's mostly a couple of teenage boys screwing around with a video camera. But after they break into a dead woman's apartment, Jesse comes out with a new invisible friend. The invisible friend talks to Jesse through the old Simon electronic game, and catches him in trust falls.5. It is explained to us that when you turn 18, you are ready for Satan because 18 = 6*3. Which is clearly 666.6. The first actual sense of supernatural danger happens about 50 minutes into the movie. The movie lasts 80 minutes. You do the math.7. Since this is another ""found-footage"" style movie, it means that 70% of the movie is deathly boring, 10% is super predictable, 10% is a collection of random scenes that make no sense, and 10% is when the characters do something really stupid.8. When something interesting does happen (like the dog scene), they always cut away before you know what happens. Then they restart the camera back at something boring.9. The last minute of the film is actually sort of clever, and shows a little bit of creativity.

The audience spent about half the time howling with laughter and half the time shrieking in fear. This one is much better seen with a significant group, I suspect.On the positive side, the setting diverged somewhat from the usual in that the movie was set in a Hispanic neighborhood and the cultural nuances of that group were well represented and added a grounded relatability to the film that the audience appreciated. The protagonists weren't wealthy white people living in an upscale housing development. They were just regular middle class kids (like the audience) The movie also had a strong element of humor that put the audience at ease early on and added substantially to the credibility of the story. Once things took a turn to the macabre the audience's reactions were visceral and there was no lack of horrified yelling. The ending tied things together nicely with the previous films and completed the story arc nicely.The only negative I would put forth is that this won't pack quite the same punch once it leaps to video.

Landon&#8216;s &#8220;Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones&#8221; is a distant relative to the earlier &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; movies, sharing the name but none of the characters or locales of the previous four (though there&#8216;s a slight connection tacked on, seemingly as an afterthought, at the end).  The supernatural events in &#8220;The Marked Ones&#8221; happen to a working-class family living in an apartment in Oxnard, CA. Upon graduating from high school, Jesse (Andrew Jacobs), with the help of his best friend, Hector (Jorge Diaz), begins filming virtually every single moment of his waking life (and some of his sleeping ones as well) with his dad&#8216;s new camera. At first, it all feels like fun and games, but soon menacing events begin to happen involving the mysterious old woman, a possible bruja, who lives downstairs from the family.Made up entirely of jittery, handheld, point-of-view shots, the movie is basically an urban version of the &#8220;The Blair Witch Project,&#8221; an innovative work that set the template for a whole sub-set of horror films to come. That means that &#8220;The Marked Ones&#8221; suffers from one of the flaws inherent in that narrative-telling device as well, namely that the characters continue filming the proceedings long after common sense - let alone the instinct for self-preservation - would have dictated that they put down the camera and start running for their lives.&#8220;Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones&#8221; earns points for its Hispanic cast and for achieving a moderately creepy moment every now and again, but it&#8217;s a pretty ho-hum affair overall, lacking the kind of over-arching structure or clear-cut resolution that would actually make it matter in the long run.

Two things immediately stand out about this film: first, it's mainstream, domestic horror starring almost exclusively Latino Americans (some Spanish dialogue but thankfully they talk slow) and second, it possesses an exceptionally unscripted feel for a found footage movie including performances charged with credibility.I absolutely loved the turn this movie took in about the last twenty minutes which is sort of a pragmatic attempt to combat evil (not attempting to be humorous) while the ""reality"" aspect of Marked Ones reminded me more the style of ""Chronicle"" than the other Paranormal Activity films and so it feels less like a sequel than a great little stand-alone horror flick.As you might imagine, you'll find no shortage of profanity, there's also the occasional gross moment and even a nude scene but none of these feel gratuitous.

Since then every horror movie has been trying to copy that style, usually failing. That rant brings me to this movie. Rather then the more realistic security camera style this one uses the two most annoying people it can find and gave them a hand-held camera. The hand-held aspect in movies never works for me, mainly because when 90% of happens in the movie you wouldn't take the time to film. This one has the name Paranormal Activity but it is nothing like the others in the series at all...the only real tie in is the last 5 minutes of the movie.

When a murder takes place, Jesse and Hector sneak into her room unwisely.Though this is a found footage film, &#8220;The Marked Ones&#8221; feels more like a conventional horror movie, breaking from the traditional ways of storytelling prevalent in the series, like a still camera and moving objects. While this is a welcome change that refreshes the series, this also means the latest entry doesn&#8217;t really have to be a &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; film, except when some of the characters from the previous &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; films reappear.Not that &#8220;Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones&#8221; is a bad film; it is only that the spin-off attempts to do something new with a very limited success.",3,(2.5 STARS) Feels More Like a Conventional Horror,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",2014,1270,"['Here', 'fifth', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', 'film', 'not', 'including', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Tokyo', 'Night', '8221', 'fact', 'franchise', 'lost', 'momentum', 'new', 'entry', 'still', 'decent', 'horror', 'movie', 'few', 'not', 'many', 'nice', 'scares.Set', 'California', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Marked', 'Ones', '8221', 'Jesse', 'Andrew', 'Jacobs', 'Hector', 'Jorge', 'Diaz', 'two', 'high', 'school', 'best', 'friends', 'who', 'notice', 'are', 'suspicious', 'activities', 'going', 'room', 'Jesse', 'neighbor', 'Anna', 'Gloria', 'Sandoval', 'When', 'murder', 'place', 'Jesse', 'Hector', 'sneak', 'room', 'found', 'footage', 'film', '8220', 'Marked', 'Ones', '8221', 'feels', 'more', 'conventional', 'horror', 'movie', 'breaking', 'traditional', 'ways', 'storytelling', 'prevalent', 'series', 'still', 'camera', 'moving', 'objects', 'welcome', 'change', 'series', 'also', 'latest', 'entry', 'doesn', '8217', 'really', 'have', 'be', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', 'film', 'when', 'characters', 'previous', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', '8221', 'films', 'reappear.Not', '8220', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Marked', 'Ones', '8221', 'bad', 'film', 'only', 'spin-off', 'attempts', 'do', 'something', 'new', 'very', 'limited', 'success']",N/A
1691722,A1Q3GEO516I4VK,B00HRCATDW,Twisted Slasher,"[0, 2]","I will say, The Marked Ones is the first Paranormal Activity movie in a while to advance the story a little bit.  After the first film, we learned Katie kidnaps Hunter in the second film, then witches are behind the curse in the third, and basically nothing in the fourth. But the new events we learn in this installment are beyond stupid...like, we're actually getting into time travel now.The movie offers its fair share of sleaze, with some boobs, more violence than usual in this series, and the record for most times a character says, ""Oh, s***!"" in a movie, as well as some juvenile dumb humor that actually does warrant a few laughs.  At this point in the series though, with these characters being really dumb and with the ending always the same (it's really not a spoiler to say everybody dies in the end!), this series is getting really tiring.  Most of the film I just wondered why every single event had to be filmed (""I just got hit by a demon! Better not forget my camera!"").Paranormal Activity 5 should just be Sam and Dean Winchester from Supernatural investigating and ending the curse once and for all so we can finally put this long-in-the-tooth series to bed.",2,"Dumb, ridiculous and not at all scary",1397001600,"04 9, 2014",2014,1179,"['will', 'say', 'Marked', 'Ones', 'first', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'movie', 'while', 'advance', 'story', 'little', 'bit', 'first', 'film', 'learned', 'Katie', 'kidnaps', 'Hunter', 'second', 'film', 'then', 'witches', 'are', 'curse', 'third', 'basically', 'nothing', 'fourth', 'new', 'events', 'learn', 'installment', 'are', 'stupid', ""'re"", 'actually', 'getting', 'time', 'travel', 'now.The', 'movie', 'fair', 'share', 'sleaze', 'boobs', 'more', 'violence', 'usual', 'series', 'record', 'most', 'times', 'character', 'Oh', 's***', 'movie', 'as', 'well', 'juvenile', 'dumb', 'humor', 'actually', 'warrant', 'few', 'laughs', 'point', 'series', 'characters', 'being', 'really', 'dumb', 'ending', 'always', 'same', 'really', 'not', 'spoiler', 'say', 'everybody', 'end', 'series', 'getting', 'really', 'tiring', 'Most', 'film', 'just', 'wondered', 'why', 'single', 'event', 'had', 'be', 'filmed', 'just', 'got', 'hit', 'demon', 'Better', 'not', 'forget', 'camera', '.Paranormal', 'Activity', '5', 'should', 'just', 'be', 'Sam', 'Dean', 'Winchester', 'Supernatural', 'investigating', 'ending', 'curse', 'once', 'can', 'finally', 'put', 'long-in-the-tooth', 'series', 'bed']",N/A
