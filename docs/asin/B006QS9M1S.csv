1519004,A2CKMDS10RKS50,B006QS9M1S,Chris,"[1, 1]","This story is perhaps better known in its later version, &#34;A Pocketful of Miracles&#34; with Bette Davis. Many prefer this version made in 1933 with May Robson as Apple Annie, a crafty character with a love for gin and a secret daughter living abroad who thinks her mother is a wealthy society lady. All the delightful Damon Runyon characters who later appeared in &#34;Guys and Dolls&#34; are here with their mangled English and rough manners. Watching them try to clean up their act to help their friend Annie to impress her prospective European in-laws is always fun. Can they possibly bring it off? Will the young lovers find happiness? Is there anybody out there who doesn't know how this story ends?",5,The original and possibly the best,1370563200,"06 7, 2013",2013,708,"['story', 'perhaps', 'better', 'known', 'later', 'version', '34', 'Pocketful', 'Miracles', '34', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Many', 'prefer', 'version', 'made', '1933', 'May', 'Robson', 'Apple', 'Annie', 'crafty', 'character', 'love', 'gin', 'secret', 'daughter', 'living', 'abroad', 'who', 'mother', 'wealthy', 'society', 'lady', 'delightful', 'Damon', 'Runyon', 'characters', 'who', 'later', 'appeared', '34', 'Guys', 'Dolls', '34', 'are', 'here', 'mangled', 'English', 'rough', 'manners', 'Watching', 'try', 'clean', 'up', 'act', 'help', 'friend', 'Annie', 'impress', 'prospective', 'European', 'in-laws', 'always', 'fun', 'Can', 'possibly', 'bring', 'off', 'Will', 'young', 'lovers', 'find', 'happiness', 'anybody', 'there', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'story']",Lady For A Day

He would later go on to make such films as &#34;It Happened One Night&#34;, &#34;The Bitter Tea of General Yen&#34;, &#34;You Can't Take it with You&#34;, &#34;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&#34;, &#34;Meet John Doe&#34;, &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;, and many others. &#34;Lady for a Day&#34; is a true film classic. Although Capra would later do a remake of the film under the title of &#34;Pocket Full of Miracles&#34;, staring Bette Davis and Glen Ford, his original &#34;Lady for a Day&#34; is still the best.
