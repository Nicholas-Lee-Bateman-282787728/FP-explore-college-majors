Arthur,"[0, 1]","This is a very weak film, asking you to think of a young soap opera male as one of the planet's great artists and an equally young and skinny bimbo as the world's major Rembrandt expert.  The bimbo accidentally spills coffee on the hunk and before long they are in bed.  And then there is the story.  It panders to every taste likely to be in the theater: chase scenes, nudity, and violence for the teen males; melodrama for the weepers, and a happy and wholly unbelievable ending for the lame of brain.  This film has ""made for TV"" written all over it.Ian Richardson makes a brief appearance as a barrister, and he must have been ashamed to take the money.  Rod Serling, from the sad look of him, needed all the cash he could get.

It does have some nudity so those with small children should be forewarned.If you are looking for a movie for grown-ups then you have found it.  The reason that this film was a box office bust is because teenagers can't identify with any of the characters or themes.  Adults will appreciate that each of the characters have conflicting desires and must operate in circumstances that they do not control.  Even the humor is of the shaded variety.I disagree with those reviewers who overanalyze it.  This was not intended to be a ""Casablanca"", but then what is?  What makes this movie work is that the audience can only guess at where the story will go next. Nothing is telegraphed.Each character's focus seems to be the cause of their own defeats.  Jason Patric's ""Donovan"" is the epitome of this.  His greatest work of art is a forgery that is so good that when he needs to prove it is a forgery, he is dismissed as a liar.Actually, as I think about it, this movie shares some elements with Casablanca.

106229,A3IH2L4B5VOA59,0790737329,"J. Houzet ""wozamoya""","[22, 24]","This movie is definitely one of those undiscovered treasures sitting on a video store shelf. I had decided to catch up on some Irene Jacob movies and found this one co-starring Jason Patric. Patric has the ability to be either annoying (e.g. Speed 2) or sympathetic, and despite the criticisms I have seen here that the character he plays is a jerk, I found his behavior necessary for the storyline. He plays Harry Donovan, a young art forger resentful of the art industry's machinations, yet stuck in his own cycle of forgery and missing opportunities to be recognized for his own talent.Donovan is approached by three sleazy Brit art dealers who commission him to forge a Rembrandt for half a million dollars, and after initially rebuffing them, he takes up the challenge.Having taken art in high school and as a sometime hobby, it was fascinating to watch Donovan at work; intently studying Rembrandt's works in Europe's art museums and libraries, carefully shopping for materials that would make his forgery appear authentic, and then imitating the Rembrandt style to perfection.Along the way, he meets the lovely Marieke van den Broeck (Irene Jacob), who as a student of art restoration, unwittingly gives Donovan access to a Rembrandt from which he gets paint samples. She is attracted by Donovan's passion for art and his indignation at the art world's injustice (guys like Van Gogh died penniless). Watching Donovan verbally demolish two French art snobs is a hoot. Marieke is enthralled. Things get hot and heavy.Of course, one could guess he would be double-crossed by the sleazy art dealers. He has to steal his own painting and go on the run, kidnapping Marieke on the way. I know a lot of this is contrived, but boy, it was entertaining.This movie made me appreciate Jason Patric as an actor, and Irene Jacob is simply lovely to watch. She conveys an innocent, unpretentious beauty, and like many French actresses, she is not shy of nudity. We also get admirable supporting characters in the form of Rod Steiger as Donovan's artist father, and Ian Holm as an art dealer.",4,A truly satisfying adventure drama,1045008000,"02 12, 2003",2003,2083,"['movie', 'definitely', 'one', 'undiscovered', 'treasures', 'sitting', 'video', 'store', 'shelf', 'had', 'decided', 'catch', 'up', 'Irene', 'Jacob', 'movies', 'found', 'one', 'co-starring', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Patric', 'ability', 'be', 'either', 'annoying', 'e.g', 'Speed', '2', 'sympathetic', 'criticisms', 'have', 'seen', 'here', 'character', 'jerk', 'found', 'behavior', 'necessary', 'storyline', 'Harry', 'Donovan', 'young', 'art', 'forger', 'resentful', 'art', 'industry', 'machinations', 'yet', 'stuck', 'own', 'cycle', 'forgery', 'missing', 'opportunities', 'be', 'recognized', 'own', 'talent.Donovan', 'approached', 'three', 'sleazy', 'Brit', 'art', 'dealers', 'who', 'commission', 'forge', 'Rembrandt', 'million', 'dollars', 'initially', 'rebuffing', 'up', 'challenge.Having', 'taken', 'art', 'high', 'school', 'sometime', 'hobby', 'was', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'Donovan', 'work', 'intently', 'studying', 'Rembrandt', 'works', 'Europe', 'art', 'museums', 'libraries', 'carefully', 'shopping', 'materials', 'would', 'make', 'forgery', 'appear', 'authentic', 'then', 'imitating', 'Rembrandt', 'style', 'perfection.Along', 'way', 'lovely', 'Marieke', 'van', 'den', 'Broeck', 'Irene', 'Jacob', 'who', 'student', 'art', 'restoration', 'unwittingly', 'Donovan', 'access', 'Rembrandt', 'paint', 'samples', 'attracted', 'Donovan', 'passion', 'art', 'indignation', 'art', 'world', 'injustice', 'guys', 'Van', 'Gogh', 'died', 'penniless', 'Watching', 'Donovan', 'verbally', 'demolish', 'two', 'French', 'art', 'snobs', 'hoot', 'Marieke', 'enthralled', 'Things', 'get', 'hot', 'heavy.Of', 'course', 'one', 'could', 'guess', 'would', 'be', 'double-crossed', 'sleazy', 'art', 'dealers', 'steal', 'own', 'painting', 'go', 'run', 'kidnapping', 'Marieke', 'way', 'know', 'lot', 'contrived', 'boy', 'was', 'entertaining.This', 'movie', 'made', 'appreciate', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'actor', 'Irene', 'Jacob', 'simply', 'lovely', 'watch', 'conveys', 'innocent', 'unpretentious', 'beauty', 'many', 'French', 'actresses', 'not', 'shy', 'nudity', 'also', 'get', 'admirable', 'supporting', 'characters', 'form', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Donovan', 'artist', 'father', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'art', 'dealer']",N/A
106230,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,0790737329,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[3, 8]","Let me start by saying that this film has a few problems.  First and foremost is the portrayal of the Harry Donovan character by Jason Patric.  Yes, he is a selfish guy--so much so that he steals a car if he feels like it.  The juxtaposition of this type of behavior with his supposed tenderness toward the female lead, played by Irene Jacob, just doesn't make it; it's absolutely not credible.Equally as bewildering is how the Jacob character can fall for a guy who so completely contradicts her refined sensibilities.  One moment she's yelling at him for being such a jerk (he is); the next, she's falling into his arms, close to swooning because of the power of his LOVE.  Oh yeah, baby.In addition, there are several logical loopholes in the film, particularly during the trial scene when the judge completely overlooks some of the criminal acts Donovan DID do.  As minor as they might have been, they're still illegal.  This was pretty annoying.So what's good about it?  Rod Steiger as Donovan's father is excellent.  And the entire sequence of how a masterwork of art can be forged is truly riveting.  As well, the color palette--not only of Donovan's painting, but of the film itself is great.  Of equal merit is the cinematography of the various locales throughout the film--it's beautiful.  Ian Holm, in an uncredited role, turns in, as usual, a solid performance.  If only he were featured more in the film.  Here's an actor who can do no wrong.Interesting, because (I don't remember his name), the British actor who plays the chief villain is one of the very few British actors I have seen on screen whom I did NOT like--too over the top.  So visually this is a feast, but the annoyances of the two leads and their wildly inconsistent behavior is a bit much.Too bad.",3,"Not terrible, not at all great",1006646400,"11 25, 2001",2001,1777,"['Let', 'start', 'saying', 'film', 'few', 'problems', 'First', 'foremost', 'portrayal', 'Harry', 'Donovan', 'character', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'Yes', 'selfish', 'guy', 'so', 'much', 'car', 'juxtaposition', 'type', 'behavior', 'supposed', 'tenderness', 'female', 'lead', 'played', 'Irene', 'Jacob', 'just', ""n't"", 'make', 'absolutely', 'not', 'credible.Equally', 'bewildering', 'how', 'Jacob', 'character', 'can', 'fall', 'guy', 'who', 'so', 'completely', 'refined', 'sensibilities', 'One', 'moment', 'yelling', 'being', 'such', 'jerk', 'next', 'falling', 'arms', 'close', 'swooning', 'power', 'LOVE', 'Oh', 'yeah', 'baby.In', 'addition', 'are', 'several', 'logical', 'loopholes', 'film', 'particularly', 'trial', 'scene', 'when', 'judge', 'completely', 'criminal', 'acts', 'Donovan', 'DID', 'do', 'As', 'minor', 'might', 'have', 'been', ""'re"", 'still', 'illegal', 'was', 'pretty', 'annoying.So', 'what', 'good', 'Rod', 'Steiger', 'Donovan', 'father', 'excellent', 'entire', 'sequence', 'how', 'masterwork', 'art', 'can', 'be', 'forged', 'truly', 'riveting', 'As', 'well', 'color', 'palette', 'not', 'only', 'Donovan', 'painting', 'film', 'great', 'equal', 'merit', 'cinematography', 'various', 'locales', 'film', 'beautiful', 'Ian', 'Holm', 'uncredited', 'role', 'usual', 'solid', 'performance', 'only', 'were', 'featured', 'more', 'film', 'Here', 'actor', 'who', 'can', 'do', 'wrong.Interesting', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'British', 'actor', 'who', 'chief', 'villain', 'one', 'very', 'few', 'British', 'actors', 'have', 'seen', 'screen', 'whom', 'did', 'NOT', 'like', 'too', 'top', 'So', 'visually', 'feast', 'annoyances', 'two', 'leads', 'wildly', 'inconsistent', 'behavior', 'bit', 'much.Too', 'bad']",N/A

But there's no charm in Harry Donovan, you only root for him as he's the least dispicable character.

106233,A152C8GYY25HAH,0790737329,Matthew Horner,"[17, 21]","Here's one of those movies I love to find for people. Who decides which movies get major releases and which ones are dispatched to a celluloid land fill? I've known some studio executives in my time. Typically, they'd shrug their shoulders and say, ""Go Figure!"".""Incognito"" was released in theaters in the UK and in Finland in late 1997. In April 1998, it got a limited two week run here. True, it will never make AFI's Top 100, but as decent escapist entertainment, it is a lot better than many of those turkeys that get millions of dollars in publicity. Some of these I refuse to write about because it's impolite to review something you can't finish watching.This clever little thriller is director John Badham's best work in a while. Badham was a really hot talent in the 1970's. There are a few holes in the plot, but he makes up for this in its entertainment factor.The subject matter is interesting. Most people don't think about art forgery often. As a profession and a business, it's been around for just a few decades. I think it began around the time artists actually got paid for their efforts. I assure you that selling art through galleries is a 20th Century invention.Here, Patric not only acts, he holds his own playing against the powerful and beautiful French actress, Irene Jacobs. Typically, American actors seem awkward and uncomfortable playing against French actresses. This cannot be said of Mr. Patric. His love scenes with Jacobs may cause your TV screen to fog up from the steam.Several things intrigued me about ""Incognito"". The character delineation is keener than usual for a thriller. Patric's art forger is not proud of what he does. This is a passionate, intelligent man, who is the first to admit that this is all about money. He knows that the huge sums he's earns does not alter the fact that, anyone who can successfully fake almost any painter's style, is so gifted that they should be doing original works of their own.When contacted by a couple of delightfully devious and evil art gallery owners, he at first not so politely refuses to do a virtually impossible forgery. He's dislike these men, but an offer of $500,000 finally changes his mind.The writing and the acting in ""Incognito"" is atypical of a thriller, because that aspect becomes subordinate to other events, such as Patric's complex love affair with Jacobs, who plays a noted French art professor.The work of art he must imitate is one by Rembrandt that lost at sea centuries ago. All that survives is the ship's manifest, which lists it only as the portrait of a man. Patric's character is a perfectionist. What man? What face? Then he remember his father [Rod Stieger], a failed artist, and begins by using his father's eyes. As the cameras twist and rotate madly around the artist, the portrait magically begins to take form. This whole section of the movie is much more intense than I can make it sound.When the painting is finished, Patric's real problems begin. He really should have turned those nasty art dealers down. Here begins the treachery and deceit any thriller must have.""Incognito"" was filmed with great attention to detail in and around London, Paris and Amsterdam.",4,"Literate, little seen thriller",1017273600,"03 28, 2002",2002,3187,"['Here', 'one', 'movies', 'love', 'find', 'people', 'Who', 'movies', 'get', 'major', 'releases', 'ones', 'are', 'dispatched', 'celluloid', 'land', 'fill', ""'ve"", 'known', 'studio', 'executives', 'time', 'Typically', ""'d"", 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'say', 'Go', 'Figure', 'Incognito', 'was', 'released', 'theaters', 'UK', 'Finland', 'late', '1997', 'April', '1998', 'got', 'limited', 'two', 'week', 'run', 'here', 'True', 'will', 'never', 'make', 'AFI', 'Top', '100', 'decent', 'escapist', 'entertainment', 'lot', 'better', 'many', 'turkeys', 'get', 'millions', 'dollars', 'publicity', 'refuse', 'write', 'impolite', 'review', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'finish', 'watching.This', 'clever', 'little', 'thriller', 'director', 'John', 'Badham', 'best', 'work', 'while', 'Badham', 'was', 'really', 'hot', 'talent', '1970', 'are', 'few', 'holes', 'plot', 'up', 'entertainment', 'factor.The', 'subject', 'matter', 'interesting', 'Most', 'people', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'art', 'forgery', 'often', 'profession', 'business', 'been', 'just', 'few', 'decades', 'think', 'began', 'time', 'actually', 'got', 'paid', 'efforts', 'assure', 'selling', 'art', 'galleries', '20th', 'Century', 'invention.Here', 'Patric', 'not', 'only', 'own', 'playing', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'French', 'actress', 'Irene', 'Jacobs', 'Typically', 'American', 'actors', 'seem', 'awkward', 'uncomfortable', 'playing', 'French', 'actresses', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'said', 'Mr.', 'Patric', 'love', 'scenes', 'Jacobs', 'may', 'cause', 'TV', 'screen', 'fog', 'up', 'steam.Several', 'things', 'intrigued', 'Incognito', 'character', 'delineation', 'keener', 'usual', 'thriller', 'Patric', 'art', 'forger', 'not', 'proud', 'what', 'passionate', 'intelligent', 'man', 'who', 'first', 'admit', 'money', 'huge', 'sums', 'earns', 'not', 'alter', 'fact', 'anyone', 'who', 'can', 'successfully', 'fake', 'almost', 'painter', 'style', 'so', 'gifted', 'should', 'be', 'doing', 'original', 'works', 'own.When', 'contacted', 'couple', 'delightfully', 'devious', 'evil', 'art', 'gallery', 'owners', 'first', 'not', 'so', 'politely', 'do', 'virtually', 'impossible', 'forgery', 'men', 'offer', '500,000', 'finally', 'mind.The', 'writing', 'acting', 'Incognito', 'atypical', 'thriller', 'aspect', 'subordinate', 'other', 'events', 'such', 'Patric', 'complex', 'love', 'affair', 'Jacobs', 'who', 'noted', 'French', 'art', 'professor.The', 'work', 'art', 'must', 'imitate', 'one', 'Rembrandt', 'lost', 'sea', 'centuries', 'ago', 'ship', 'manifest', 'only', 'portrait', 'man', 'Patric', 'character', 'perfectionist', 'What', 'man', 'What', 'face', 'Then', 'remember', 'father', '[', 'Rod', 'Stieger', ']', 'failed', 'artist', 'begins', 'using', 'father', 'eyes', 'cameras', 'twist', 'rotate', 'madly', 'artist', 'portrait', 'magically', 'take', 'form', 'whole', 'section', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'intense', 'can', 'make', 'sound.When', 'painting', 'finished', 'Patric', 'real', 'problems', 'begin', 'really', 'should', 'have', 'turned', 'nasty', 'art', 'dealers', 'down', 'Here', 'treachery', 'deceit', 'thriller', 'must', 'have', 'Incognito', 'was', 'filmed', 'great', 'attention', 'detail', 'London', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam']",N/A

Jason Patric should have been a huge star, as he carries this story with expertly acted motivations and reactions.  He plays the world's leading forger of paintings who played it safe with third rate works until he is offered half a million to do a long lost Rembrandt.

And if you are into art, you will enjoy this movie all the more, as the lead character forges a Rembrandt by mixing paints from raw pigments, grinding them, baking the painting in an oven to age it.

106240,AK61LQI92GTCH,0790737329,"Steven Hellerstedt ""SH""","[1, 2]","Art forger Harry Donovan (Jason Patric) agrees to one last job before making dad happy by giving up the shamming and pursuing his own art.  His last job's a lulu, too - paint a `lost' Rembrandt.  Lost off the coast of Spain centuries ago with no surviving copies.It's a solid enough premise around which to build a movie.  Films about obsessive people tend to be interesting, and expert art forgers - Donovan is supposed to be one of the best - have to be obsessive.  And it's easy to get swept up in films that pursue their own idiosyncratic obsessions.  Creating the perfect forgery seems a natural.  How does the crook outwit the experts?  Where are the pitfalls on the trail to the perfect fake?INCOGNITO cares about some of that stuff, but it cares about more, too much more, besides.  To begin with there's a trio of unscrupulous art dealers Donovan has to deal with.  They're here mainly to provide thriller fodder - they fund the `last job' and are show up at the end to betray the intense young artist.  Then there's Prof. Marieke van den Broeck (Ir&egrave;ne Jacob,) the beautiful art expert who `feels' one candidate isn't a real Rembrandt and more or less jets around Europe bumping into Donovan.  Of course the pretty Prof. and Donovan tryst, fall in and out of love, get handcuffed together for an escape through Britain, and cement their bond during an extended, and unconvincing, movie-ending courtroom act.  Some movies throw in a little bit of everything.  Of course, with the gorgeous Jacob and GQ-coverboy Patric in the lead I guess crowding a bumpy love affair into an already overloaded movie ought to have been expected.INCOGNITO isn't a bad movie, but it's not one you lean into, either.  There's an awful lot of hokum going on - the bad-guy art dealers were forced, the events that led up to the trial strained at the credibility leash, and the trial itself was thin and unconvincing.  A shaky three-stars for this one.",3,Alright thriller,1152316800,"07 8, 2006",2006,1944,"['Art', 'forger', 'Harry', 'Donovan', 'Jason', 'Patric', 'one', 'last', 'job', 'making', 'dad', 'happy', 'giving', 'up', 'shamming', 'pursuing', 'own', 'art', 'last', 'job', 'lulu', 'too', 'paint', 'lost', 'Rembrandt', 'Lost', 'coast', 'Spain', 'centuries', 'ago', 'surviving', 'copies.It', 'solid', 'enough', 'premise', 'around', 'build', 'movie', 'Films', 'obsessive', 'people', 'tend', 'be', 'interesting', 'expert', 'art', 'forgers', 'Donovan', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'best', 'have', 'be', 'obsessive', 'easy', 'get', 'swept', 'up', 'films', 'pursue', 'own', 'idiosyncratic', 'obsessions', 'Creating', 'perfect', 'forgery', 'natural', 'How', 'crook', 'experts', 'Where', 'are', 'pitfalls', 'trail', 'perfect', 'fake', 'INCOGNITO', 'stuff', 'more', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'besides', 'begin', 'trio', 'unscrupulous', 'art', 'dealers', 'Donovan', 'deal', ""'re"", 'here', 'mainly', 'provide', 'thriller', 'fodder', 'fund', 'last', 'job', 'are', 'show', 'up', 'end', 'betray', 'intense', 'young', 'artist', 'Then', 'Prof.', 'Marieke', 'van', 'den', 'Broeck', 'Ir', 'egrave', 'Jacob', 'beautiful', 'art', 'expert', 'who', 'feels', 'one', 'candidate', ""n't"", 'real', 'Rembrandt', 'more', 'less', 'jets', 'Europe', 'bumping', 'Donovan', 'course', 'pretty', 'Prof.', 'Donovan', 'tryst', 'fall', 'love', 'get', 'handcuffed', 'together', 'escape', 'Britain', 'cement', 'bond', 'extended', 'unconvincing', 'movie-ending', 'courtroom', 'act', 'movies', 'throw', 'little', 'bit', 'everything', 'course', 'gorgeous', 'Jacob', 'GQ-coverboy', 'Patric', 'lead', 'guess', 'crowding', 'bumpy', 'love', 'affair', 'already', 'overloaded', 'movie', 'ought', 'have', 'been', 'expected.INCOGNITO', ""n't"", 'bad', 'movie', 'not', 'one', 'lean', 'either', 'awful', 'lot', 'hokum', 'going', 'bad-guy', 'art', 'dealers', 'were', 'forced', 'events', 'led', 'up', 'trial', 'strained', 'credibility', 'leash', 'trial', 'was', 'thin', 'unconvincing', 'shaky', 'three-stars', 'one']",N/A

His performances are always finely nuanced and more than this movie calls, but it is exactly his detailed creation of his character(s) that makes him the great actor that he was--no matter what the director might desire.
