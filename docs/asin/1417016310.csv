I am a barbie collector and dealer and I got this so I could find out more about this line of dolls. First off.. its a good story and a good movie. The morals, Maturity, Creativity, Believeing in one's self, and loyalty to family, are all good for kids to know and are not done in such a way as to make grown ups like my self want to Heave.I find the animation really well done, however I do have to say that the animation in the Fairytoipa line is better done, and the stories are a bit better than this to.Still its a good way to enertain your young girls and keep them outta the summer sun or winter cold for a hour or so, and something that they will like.The dolls are a nice addition if a Tad over done, 12 is a lot of dolls people. But the main character is a beauty and one that is worth adding to the collection, tho again its not as nice as the fairytopia dolls which I am rather partial to.As for the mothers out there who worry that barbie will give thier little one self esteem issues, or body image problems, this one is realativly safe, the barbies in this are not over done and while still a bit skinner than normal look healthy not Super model unrealistic.So if you little one is fond of dancing, she will like his movie and the dolls that go with.cheers.",3,Good Movie,1214092800,"06 22, 2008",2008,1371,"['Hi', ""'ve"", 'reviewed', 'several', 'barbie', 'items', 'here', 'time', 'time', 'most', 'recent', 'am', 'barbie', 'collector', 'dealer', 'got', 'could', 'find', 'out', 'more', 'line', 'dolls', 'First', 'good', 'story', 'good', 'movie', 'morals', 'Maturity', 'Creativity', 'Believeing', 'one', 'self', 'loyalty', 'family', 'are', 'good', 'kids', 'know', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'such', 'way', 'make', 'grown', 'ups', 'self', 'want', 'Heave.I', 'find', 'animation', 'really', 'well', 'done', 'however', 'do', 'have', 'say', 'animation', 'Fairytoipa', 'line', 'better', 'done', 'stories', 'are', 'bit', 'better', 'to.Still', 'good', 'way', 'enertain', 'young', 'girls', 'keep', 'outta', 'summer', 'sun', 'winter', 'cold', 'hour', 'so', 'something', 'will', 'like.The', 'dolls', 'are', 'nice', 'addition', 'Tad', 'done', '12', 'lot', 'dolls', 'people', 'main', 'character', 'beauty', 'one', 'worth', 'adding', 'collection', 'tho', 'again', 'not', 'as', 'nice', 'fairytopia', 'am', 'rather', 'partial', 'to.As', 'mothers', 'who', 'worry', 'barbie', 'will', 'give', 'thier', 'little', 'one', 'self', 'esteem', 'issues', 'body', 'image', 'problems', 'one', 'realativly', 'safe', 'barbies', 'are', 'not', 'done', 'still', 'bit', 'skinner', 'normal', 'look', 'healthy', 'not', 'Super', 'model', 'unrealistic.So', 'little', 'one', 'fond', 'dancing', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'dolls', 'go', 'with.cheers']",N/A

They have a mean step mother who says ""don't do that, don't do that"". I like this story because they all worked together as a team. It shows to kids how to work together. Music is very pretty and it sounds like real princess music - it makes you want to dance along. If you like ballet this music will make you dance in front of the mirror. There is only one thing I don't like - when the mean stepmother takes away the colors. She gives step-daughters gowns that have no colors (kind of gray).

This is (loosely) based on the fairy tale of the 12 dancing princesses. Rewritten and remodelled for a Barbie-style ballet movie.Genivieve is the 7th of 12 princesses. Her father calls for the Duchess Rowena to look after them as his wife is dead. The duchess has plans of her own, and with her strong-man servant and her monkey, she works to take over the kingdom and get rid of the 12 daughters. She starts by taking all the fun and colour out of their lives, trying to quash their spirit.Genivieve, however, discovers  a secret magical kingdom below the floor of their bedroom where the princesses can escape at night and dance the night away until morning. They have their dancing shoes from Eric, the Cobbler who also happens to be extremely gorgeous and nice - and not a little in love with Genivieve. When Rowena discovers the secret stairwell she seeks to trap the princesses down there forever. But toghether they escape, and rush to save their father who Rowena is attempting to kill.It is a lovely movie, there is lots of dancing which is beautifully done given there are twelve characters it is easy to form nice chorus lines etc. 3 are little Kelly sized girls, there are 2 teenagers and the other 7 are adult sized. There could be some confusion, luckily they are named alphabetically from A to L according to age - unfortunately many have very un=princessy names like Lacey, Hadley and Courtenay.The animation is lovely although there is an odd piece of oddity in the filming. For some reason near the end when Genivieve is luring Desmond away from his post she seems to go out of focus slightly, it might be my particular player.There are some nice extra features, the making of the movie is excellent and my children were fascinated by it.I really like the toning down of colours. The castle and environs looked colourful without the overwhelming brightness of some of the earlier movies.Overall this is a great fun movie which my children have enjoyed a number of times and I also enjoyed. It can be watched many times and still find something new. I just hope that the Barbie makers will be working on another singing movie. the Princess and the Pauper still rates as the top Barbie movie ever - the songs were inspired and fun.

The faces look really weird and the arms look overly long even though the unfashionable half sleeves on the princess dresses should visually shorten the arms.

I was looking for something pretty and sweet instead I find a soap opera about conniving adults, frivolous American-style dialogue with that tang of rudeness that replaces wit in American script writing, a weird too close to the family service provider (he'd be the UNSUB if this was an episode of Criminal Minds) which is not good if you are trying to teach kids to not be susceptible to friendly strangers and a very strange approach about oversized families.  It's just a very weird way to sell 12+ dolls who are mostly differentiated by the color of their interchangeable outfits. I was expecting a lot more from the music and the choreography but I have a much better idea about ballet cartoons for little girls.

And such a sweet story about 12 royal sisters trying to grow up in a Kingdom without their mother (it is implied she passed on years before).  Their father (the King) tries his best to raise them as young ladies but feels he has fallen short so he asks his cousin the Duchess to help teach the girls to be more refined.  I found several points where it was so touching, I got misty eyed!  And both my daughters were completely engrossed for the entire movie!

172212,A3ONTLXQ85EE4G,1417016310,Marshall Lord,"[32, 33]","Before we first rented one of the Barbie videos for my daughter, I was expecting them to be trite, over-commercialised, and over-sugary. However, I have been pleasantly surprised.Yes, they do have a lot of commercial spin-offs and a high saccarine count, but the quality of the Barbie films we have subsequently bought or rented, including ""12 Dancing Princesses,"" was significantly higher than I had expected. They have not just kept my children engrossed for hours - including my son as well as my daughter - but introduced them to some beautiful stories and truly wonderful music. On more than one occasion I have been listening to a CD of a classic such as Beethoven's pastoral symphony, or The Queen of the Night's aria from Mozart's magic flute, and my daughter has recognised and expressed appreciation of the music, and correctly remembered which Barbie film had used it. (""Magic of Pegasus"" and ""Mermaidia"" respectively.)The soundtrack to ""Twelve Dancing Princesses"" is mostly adapted from some of Mendelsohn's best work, including ""A Midsummer night's dream"" and the Scottish and Italian symphonies. It also includes a lullaby sung to the King by the 12 princesses which was based on a 16th century anthem by Byrd, the recording of which was sung beautifully by Melissa Lyons and the Women's Occidental Glee club.The story is loosely based on the children's story. ""Barbie"" plays ""Princess Genevieve"", the seventh of 12 daughters of a widowed King (e.g. seven young women, plus a pair of twins who appear to be about 11 and a set of triplets who appear to be about 6.) Like the original, the story is about 12 princesses who having been banned from dancing, sneak off every night through a magic passage and take a magic barge to a special island where they can dance all night. However, in this version the killjoy who tries to stop them dancing is not the King their father, who loves them very much, but his cousin, Duchess Rowena, who he has brought to the palace to be their tutor. At first even the princesses do not realise quite what a bad mistake this was ...As with many of the Barbie films, comic relief is provided by talking animal companions of some of the principal characaters. In this case Princess Genevieve has a pet cat, and the evil Duchess Rowena has an equally evil pet monkey, Brutus. The hero, who in this version is the royal cobbler, Derek, has a pet parrot, who for some reason talks with a greatly exaggerated Indian accent. (That's Indian from the subcontinent, not native American.)Those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them. And the female characters are all on the thin side of plausibility: I'm not worried that watching this is going to give my daughter anorexia as she likes food too much and has a good sense of the difference between fantasy and reality, but if you are worried that your children may be forming an unrealistic idea about how thin a healthy body shape is, that is a concern with this film.But on the plus side: it is beautifully made, it will hold the attention of most small children for long enough for the typical exhausted parent to clear the mess they have made in several rooms of the house or collapse for an hour's rest after doing so. Alternatively there are enough more sophisticated jokes thrown in that you won't be completely bored to death if you decide to watch it with your offspring. And best of all, the soundtrack is almost worth buying the film for on it's own.",4,Charming take on the children's story,1161820800,"10 26, 2006",2006,3702,"['first', 'rented', 'one', 'Barbie', 'videos', 'daughter', 'was', 'expecting', 'be', 'trite', 'over-commercialised', 'over-sugary', 'However', 'have', 'been', 'pleasantly', 'surprised.Yes', 'do', 'have', 'lot', 'commercial', 'spin-offs', 'high', 'saccarine', 'count', 'quality', 'Barbie', 'films', 'have', 'subsequently', 'bought', 'rented', 'including', '12', 'Dancing', 'Princesses', 'was', 'significantly', 'higher', 'had', 'expected', 'have', 'not', 'just', 'kept', 'children', 'engrossed', 'hours', 'including', 'son', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'introduced', 'beautiful', 'stories', 'truly', 'wonderful', 'music', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'have', 'been', 'listening', 'CD', 'classic', 'such', 'Beethoven', 'pastoral', 'symphony', 'Queen', 'Night', 'aria', 'Mozart', 'magic', 'flute', 'daughter', 'recognised', 'expressed', 'appreciation', 'music', 'correctly', 'remembered', 'Barbie', 'film', 'had', 'used', 'Magic', 'Pegasus', 'Mermaidia', 'respectively', 'soundtrack', 'Twelve', 'Dancing', 'Princesses', 'mostly', 'adapted', 'Mendelsohn', 'best', 'work', 'including', 'Midsummer', 'night', 'dream', 'Scottish', 'Italian', 'symphonies', 'also', 'lullaby', 'sung', 'King', '12', 'princesses', 'was', 'based', '16th', 'century', 'anthem', 'Byrd', 'recording', 'was', 'sung', 'beautifully', 'Melissa', 'Lyons', 'Women', 'Occidental', 'Glee', 'club.The', 'story', 'loosely', 'based', 'children', 'story', 'Barbie', 'Princess', 'Genevieve', 'seventh', '12', 'daughters', 'widowed', 'King', 'e.g', 'seven', 'young', 'women', 'pair', 'twins', 'who', 'appear', 'be', '11', 'set', 'triplets', 'who', 'appear', 'be', 'about', '6', 'original', 'story', '12', 'princesses', 'who', 'having', 'been', 'banned', 'dancing', 'sneak', 'off', 'night', 'magic', 'passage', 'take', 'magic', 'barge', 'special', 'island', 'where', 'can', 'dance', 'night', 'However', 'version', 'killjoy', 'who', 'stop', 'dancing', 'not', 'King', 'father', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'cousin', 'Duchess', 'Rowena', 'who', 'brought', 'palace', 'be', 'tutor', 'first', 'even', 'princesses', 'do', 'not', 'realise', 'quite', 'what', 'bad', 'mistake', 'was', 'many', 'Barbie', 'films', 'comic', 'relief', 'provided', 'talking', 'animal', 'companions', 'principal', 'characaters', 'case', 'Princess', 'Genevieve', 'pet', 'cat', 'evil', 'Duchess', 'Rowena', 'equally', 'evil', 'pet', 'monkey', 'Brutus', 'hero', 'who', 'version', 'royal', 'cobbler', 'Derek', 'pet', 'parrot', 'who', 'reason', 'talks', 'greatly', 'exaggerated', 'Indian', 'accent', 'Indian', 'subcontinent', 'not', 'native', 'American', 'people', 'who', 'enjoy', 'criticising', 'what', 'Barbie', 'franchise', 'will', 'not', 'have', 'much', 'difficulty', 'finding', 'things', 'production', 'sneer', 'more', 'importantly', 'kids', 'are', 'allergic', 'excess', 'twee', 'sweetness', 'then', 'film', 'Barbie', 'videos', 'generally', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'female', 'characters', 'are', 'thin', 'side', 'plausibility', ""'m"", 'not', 'worried', 'watching', 'going', 'give', 'daughter', 'anorexia', 'food', 'too', 'much', 'good', 'sense', 'difference', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'are', 'worried', 'children', 'may', 'be', 'forming', 'unrealistic', 'idea', 'how', 'thin', 'healthy', 'body', 'shape', 'concern', 'film.But', 'plus', 'side', 'beautifully', 'made', 'will', 'hold', 'attention', 'most', 'small', 'children', 'long', 'enough', 'typical', 'exhausted', 'parent', 'clear', 'mess', 'have', 'made', 'several', 'rooms', 'house', 'collapse', 'hour', 'rest', 'doing', 'so', 'Alternatively', 'are', 'enough', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'jokes', 'thrown', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'completely', 'bored', 'death', 'decide', 'watch', 'offspring', 'best', 'soundtrack', 'almost', 'worth', 'buying', 'film', 'own']",N/A

Absolutely everything that is sweet, pretty, imaginative, colorful-a dream come true. Mattel won't be able to top this one. The animation is graceful, airy, bright and beautiful. The skirts move with liquid ease- very realistic. The 12 princesses, while considered rambunctious by most, are the perfect role models for little girls. They are well-mannered, kind, good-hearted, and they love each other to the death. Not a nasty word is uttered, and no bad attitudes mar this film. The plot is (while predictable, as most Barbie movies) interesting and is complemented by lovely dancing and a wonderful score.I have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it. I had lost interest in Barbie and playing with dolls, when I gave this movie as a gift to the girls I babysit. I watched it with them, and instantly- I was hooked! It absolutely captured me. Now I am a die-hard fan of Barbie, her movies, and the dolls. It brought back so many memories and stirred so many emotions. Being a dancer, it appealed to me with its amazing choreography and music. What's not to like about it? There's girls of all ages- three young girls, 5 yo, two girls in the 11-13 range, and then seven in the 15-21 age. There's singing, comic relief in the form of-what else?-a kitten, a bird, and a monkey. An unlikely trio, but it works. The scenes between Genevieve and Lacey are so sweet- they portray exactly how a big sister should help her younger siblings. I could go on and on an on about this amazing movie- but I won't. Buy it and see for yourself. This is one that will be a classic for a long time- not a hip, cool movie that will be a fad for a while and then die. Because they're not trying to be hip or fit in to the modern world. It tells little girls to be little girls- to dream, reach for the stars, and stirs imagination at the same time.

I watched it with her, and I enjoyed it just as much as she did. It has an excellent story, an excellent message, and wonderful visuals.Although this film is now several years old, the animation is probably one of the best in the computer-animated Barbie movie series. The textures are finely detailed -- from the sets to the wardrobes to the faces. Movements and expressions are exceptionally fluid and extremely lifelike -- at times, you'll forget you're watching something computer animated. The dresses and skirts move in a natural fashion as the girls dance -- there is nothing stiff about this animation at all. It is a pleasure to watch.The music is also very enjoyable, especially through a sound system. The classical music and original themes really add to the overall atmosphere of the production. The music is probably my favorite part of this film.The characters are enjoyable -- you have your typical villain and sidekick, some comic animals, a prince, and the princesses. Voice acting is superb and believable.
