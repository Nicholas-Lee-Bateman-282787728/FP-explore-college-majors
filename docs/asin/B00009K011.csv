Mena Suvari handled her part quite well, and Harry Dean Stanton comes across as the veteran pro that he is.  The direction, however, is a bit shaky.  The story mostly plays as a big screen production, but at times devolves into moments of forced drama, melodramatic like one would see on the big stage.  Most of these scenes involved the mother character and left me with an odd feeling of disbelief.  The story, then, gives mixed results, falling short of convincing us of the plights of its characters.",3,mostly sunny,1272412800,"04 28, 2010",2010,600,"['acting', 'most', 'part', 'superb', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'James', 'Franco', 'do', 'better', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'handled', 'part', 'quite', 'well', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'veteran', 'pro', 'direction', 'however', 'bit', 'shaky', 'story', 'mostly', 'big', 'screen', 'production', 'times', 'devolves', 'moments', 'forced', 'drama', 'melodramatic', 'one', 'would', 'see', 'big', 'stage', 'Most', 'scenes', 'involved', 'mother', 'character', 'left', 'odd', 'feeling', 'disbelief', 'story', 'then', 'mixed', 'results', 'falling', 'short', 'convincing', 'plights', 'characters']",Sonny

753724,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00009K011,Grady Harp,"[4, 7]","Given the talent of Nicolas Cage (even though this is his debut as a director), Brenda Blethyn, James Franco, Mena Suvari, Brenda Vacarro, and Harry Dean Stanton, one would think this little film was a sure-fire hit.  The ingredients are all there, but the problem is the story itself.  Many books and films are out there telling the tale of a young hustler who attempts to forsake his old life for something better, only to fall back on his only known existence that works, even with the added twist that the hustling techniques were taught from the crib by his call girl mother who now relies on her protege son to be her old age pension. Tennessee Williams handled these twisted tales with sleazy dignity, giving us characters developed well enough that we could believe them if not identify with them.  There is where this film falls on its face: the script (and director) are more concerned with graphically showing us the spectrum of sexual deviation than with taking the time for such indispensibly important issues as character development.  Cage may in time match his acting skills with directing skills, but here he wastes the talent of such troopers as Blethyn, Stanton and Vacarro as well as promising newcomers Franco and Suvari.Poorly edited and tastelessly scored with a melange of music types, this film just sinks into the mud of Lousiana streets.

753725,A1ST1XBL6EQTBV,B00009K011,HE WHO FUNKS BEHIND THE ROWS!!,"[5, 5]","Sonny (James Franco) is a young male hustler who grew up very fast in New Orleans'fabled and infamous FRENCH QUARTER. When the movie begins, he has just come back homeafter a few years, from serving in the Army. He is full of promise and hope, as he intends tochange his life now and get a legitimate job in Texas or somewhere other than NOLA, where heis well known as a young & highly skilled pleaser of older wealthier New Orleans society ladies.His mother, Jewel, is an ex-prostitute who is waaay past her prime, and she knows it.But her real skills lie in the arts of manipulation and emotional blackmail.She is said to have ""schooled"" her young Sonny in the arts of carnal pleasures from the age of twelve.This info in itself is left open, so your mind is left to draw the weird, creepy, taboo conclusion thatperhaps his mom kicked it with him (in bed) a few times, to get him ready for life as NOLA's premiere gigolo!(Eeee-yol!!)---though you never actually see anything inappropriate between them, it is implied in a way!She again, is a master manipulator, who'll use anything or anyone in her path to keep herself afloat financially.Once her Sonny comes back home, he finds that she has replace him with a young female prostitute named Carol,who is blonde, beautiful, and as skilled in her craft as Sonny is.She also shares Sonny's ambition to rid himself of his past life, and to seek redemption,as it were, through living a legitimate and respectable life.Well, without giving too much more away...Long story short, Sonny Boy's mother is not too pleased at all with his plans tojust visit NOLA, then leave!--There's still money to be made in her boy! (-:She is equally annoyed that a bond is building between her boy / meal ticket, and her best ""girl"",so she sets out to destroy this burgeoning union, and to crush whatever dreams that they bothmay have of legitimacy and redemption, just so she can selfishly keep a roof over her head andfood in her belly and ever-widening hips.As the story unfolds, a series of unfortunate events unfurls, and poor Sonny finds himself right smackdab in the middle of the street life again! His once very possible dreams and hopes begin to fade, as hefinds himself turning tricks with New Orleans' elite high society sexually frustrated divas, one playedby veteran actress Brenda Vaccarro. For fans of James Franco's hotness, as well as his incredible actingability, there is plenty of gratuitous nudity and undulation happening throughout for your enjoyment.But seriously, though this is a low budget film, it still manages to communicate and tell a story.Nicholas Cage, did a decent directing job, and the story is filled with quirks, weird twists, etc.,which you expect from an eccentric like Cage. He even does a seedy cameo role towards the end,when Sonny, distraught over finding out that one of his best childhood family friends and supporterswas indeed his father, (another lie from his mother), after he is killed in a freak accident,explodes in rage, and goes berserk in a night of drinking and destruction in the French Quarter,that finds him going outside of his usual female clientele to turn a ""rough trade"" trick with alocal business man, which turns really ugly!Anywayz, as the story concludes, both Sonny and Carol (who actually does muster thewhere-with-all to leave for awhile), are left to decide if they can REALLY LEAVE THE LIFE BEHINDto start a new one together, or are they indeed trapped in the seedier side of this life that theyhave both been plunged into from birth? )-:Sonny's mother lays the emotional blackmail and motherly guilt-inducing hysterics on thick,in a final attempt to keep him in her grasp, and to use him up, until his shelf life is over,or she dies first!---She doesn't care about anything or anyone, but her own selfish ends.Ultimately, for them, as it is with each and everyone of us, the decision is theirs! (-:Once again, I say that I got it, and liked it... If you are expecting a very polished production,then you'll be disappointed, because this film was meant to be like a gritty independent.But the performances of a young James Franco, as well as his supporting cast:Brenda Blethyn (Jewel), Mena Suvari (Carol), Harry Dean Stanton (friend / father), with shortperformances by hottie Scott Caan, Brenda Vaccaro, and Nicholas Cage himself (who also directed),make this an interesting viewing experience to say the least.  ****4 Stars Overall****",4,I liked it...An early James Franco vehicle directed by Nicholas Cage.,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",2011,4443,"['Sonny', 'James', 'Franco', 'young', 'male', 'hustler', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'very', 'fast', 'New', ""Orleans'fabled"", 'infamous', 'FRENCH', 'QUARTER', 'When', 'movie', 'just', 'come', 'back', 'homeafter', 'few', 'years', 'serving', 'Army', 'full', 'promise', 'hope', 'tochange', 'life', 'now', 'get', 'legitimate', 'job', 'Texas', 'somewhere', 'other', 'NOLA', 'where', 'heis', 'well', 'known', 'young', 'highly', 'skilled', 'pleaser', 'older', 'wealthier', 'New', 'Orleans', 'society', 'ladies.His', 'mother', 'Jewel', 'ex-prostitute', 'who', 'waaay', 'prime', 'real', 'skills', 'lie', 'arts', 'manipulation', 'emotional', 'blackmail.She', 'said', 'have', 'schooled', 'young', 'Sonny', 'arts', 'carnal', 'pleasures', 'age', 'twelve.This', 'info', 'left', 'open', 'so', 'mind', 'left', 'draw', 'weird', 'creepy', 'taboo', 'conclusion', 'mom', 'kicked', 'bed', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'ready', 'life', 'NOLA', 'premiere', 'gigolo', 'Eeee-yol', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'anything', 'inappropriate', 'implied', 'way', 'again', 'master', 'manipulator', 'who', ""'ll"", 'use', 'anything', 'anyone', 'path', 'keep', 'afloat', 'financially.Once', 'Sonny', 'back', 'home', 'replace', 'young', 'female', 'prostitute', 'named', 'Carol', 'who', 'blonde', 'beautiful', 'skilled', 'craft', 'Sonny', 'is.She', 'also', 'shares', 'Sonny', 'ambition', 'rid', 'past', 'life', 'seek', 'redemption', 'were', 'living', 'legitimate', 'respectable', 'life.Well', 'giving', 'too', 'much', 'more', 'away', 'Long', 'story', 'short', 'Sonny', 'Boy', 'mother', 'not', 'too', 'pleased', 'plans', 'tojust', 'visit', 'NOLA', 'then', 'leave', 'still', 'money', 'be', 'made', 'boy', 'equally', 'annoyed', 'bond', 'building', 'boy', '/', 'meal', 'ticket', 'best', 'girl', 'out', 'destroy', 'burgeoning', 'union', 'crush', 'dreams', 'bothmay', 'have', 'legitimacy', 'redemption', 'just', 'can', 'selfishly', 'keep', 'roof', 'head', 'andfood', 'belly', 'ever-widening', 'hips.As', 'story', 'unfolds', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'unfurls', 'poor', 'Sonny', 'right', 'smackdab', 'middle', 'street', 'life', 'again', 'once', 'very', 'possible', 'dreams', 'begin', 'fade', 'hefinds', 'turning', 'tricks', 'New', 'Orleans', 'elite', 'high', 'society', 'sexually', 'frustrated', 'divas', 'one', 'playedby', 'veteran', 'actress', 'Brenda', 'Vaccarro', 'fans', 'James', 'Franco', 'hotness', 'as', 'well', 'incredible', 'actingability', 'plenty', 'gratuitous', 'nudity', 'undulation', 'happening', 'enjoyment.But', 'seriously', 'low', 'budget', 'film', 'still', 'communicate', 'tell', 'story.Nicholas', 'Cage', 'did', 'decent', 'directing', 'job', 'story', 'filled', 'quirks', 'weird', 'twists', 'etc.', 'expect', 'eccentric', 'like', 'Cage', 'even', 'seedy', 'cameo', 'role', 'end', 'when', 'Sonny', 'distraught', 'finding', 'out', 'one', 'best', 'childhood', 'family', 'friends', 'supporterswas', 'indeed', 'father', 'lie', 'mother', 'killed', 'freak', 'accident', 'explodes', 'rage', 'berserk', 'night', 'drinking', 'destruction', 'French', 'Quarter', 'going', 'usual', 'female', 'clientele', 'turn', 'rough', 'trade', 'trick', 'alocal', 'business', 'man', 'really', 'ugly', 'Anywayz', 'story', 'Sonny', 'Carol', 'who', 'actually', 'muster', 'thewhere-with-all', 'leave', 'awhile', 'are', 'left', 'decide', 'can', 'REALLY', 'LEAVE', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'BEHINDto', 'start', 'new', 'one', 'together', 'are', 'indeed', 'trapped', 'seedier', 'side', 'life', 'theyhave', 'been', 'plunged', 'birth', 'Sonny', 'mother', 'emotional', 'blackmail', 'motherly', 'guilt-inducing', 'hysterics', 'thick', 'final', 'attempt', 'keep', 'grasp', 'use', 'up', 'shelf', 'life', 'over', 'first', '-She', ""n't"", 'care', 'anything', 'anyone', 'own', 'selfish', 'ends.Ultimately', 'everyone', 'decision', 'theirs', 'Once', 'again', 'say', 'got', 'liked', 'are', 'expecting', 'very', 'polished', 'production', 'then', ""'ll"", 'be', 'disappointed', 'film', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'gritty', 'independent.But', 'performances', 'young', 'James', 'Franco', 'as', 'well', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Jewel', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'Carol', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'friend', '/', 'father', 'shortperformances', 'hottie', 'Scott', 'Caan', 'Brenda', 'Vaccaro', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'who', 'also', 'directed', 'make', 'interesting', 'viewing', 'experience', 'say', 'least', '****4', 'Stars', 'Overall****']",Sonny
753726,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B00009K011,Jason,"[5, 7]","When Sonny (James Franco) returns from his stint in the Army, he has high hopes of a new life.  Hoping to move away from his old life in New Orleans, and pinning his chance at change on a bookstore job offered by his Army buddy, he makes a cursory stop to see family and friends before getting on the road.  Getting away from the town and influence is a simple decision; moving on from his former life as a gigolo is not so easy.  Trained by his mother Jewel (Brenda Blethyn) to be nearly the perfect male prostitute (huh!?), Sonny lets his loins lead his path when the job offer falls through.At its core, this movie is the classic underdog tale.  Granted, not many underdogs get to have continuous sex and get paid for it, but it's nonetheless a story about someone attempting to rise above the trappings of his meager beginnings towards the white-picket fence dreams of normalcy, and possibly love.Franco is fairly believable as a slick sex-peddler Sonny, but Henry (Harry Dean Stanton) is the character with the most resonance.  Streetwise enough to survive, but feeble enough to be a failure, Henry is a beaten soul who exudes depression and would beg to be put out of his misery if he didn't feel such responsibility for his relationship with Jewel and his friendship with Sonny.  He completely nails his role and brings about the only true emotion of the film.  Carol (Mena Suvari), a young up-and-comer (?) in Jewel's ranks, futilely and unconvincingly portrays a lady of the night who becomes Sonny's love interest.  I guess she went from the gateway drug in American Beauty, to meth in Spun, and hooking was her last-ditch alternative.  Her performance, however, is praiseworthy compared to one other.  Brenda Blethyn had the effrontery to apply on a southern accent like a hooker slathers on cheap makeup: appallingly thick, staggered and disjointed like a clown's face-paint, and an insult to the senses.  There hasn't been a worse accent since James Van Der Beek butchered a Texas accent in Varsity Blues.The plot is underdeveloped, and the emotion is lacking.  In his directorial debut, Nicholas Cage succeeded in creating a state of emotional, psychological prison, but failed to truly bind relief or freedom into the resolution.  Production-wise, the picture represented Louisiana well, but the visual was not enough to overpower the message-delivery failure.",3,Sonny was trained to do this by his mother?

Martin ""ffej26""","[3, 4]","James Franco delivers another intense, emotional performance in Nicholas Cage's directorial debut Sonny, about a young man who is forced to choose between hustling and living a normal life. The story is intriguing, but never fully developed, and the directing is choppy which makes for difficult viewing. The acting is ok from most of the actors. Besides from James Franco, Mena Suvari finally gives a performance that is worth mentioning. Brenda Bleythyn is over the top, annoying, and loud, and the accent-obnoxious. She usually gives amazing performances, but this time, she missed, and Nic Cage comes in at the end with a rediculous cameo. The films pace is a little slow, but it did keep my interest.

753728,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B00009K011,Kevin Killian,"[4, 4]","""Carol,"" with her 20s flapper bob done up in platinum blonde, is a weary young prostitute who is tiring of never being able to have children.  I can see why Mena Suvari jumped through hoops to play this part: she gets to walk through the rain, kiss James Franco while supine on a pile of hay in the barn, and also sink hysterically onto her knees in a giant mud puddle in the middle of a storm while sobbing her eyes out and suffering the indignity of having her mascara run.  Even on SIX FEET UNDER Mena Suvari rarely got to stretch her acting muscles like this.  She begs Sonny to love her and let her bear his children, just to run off somewhere where they wouldn't have to be male and female prostitutes and they could just be normal people.Well, as many have speculated, this is probably an allegory for the relationship between Cage himself and his kooky wife, Patricia Arquette, both of whom were typecast by the old Hollywood casting system.  Arquette finally broke free, divorcing Cage and finding her own network success with ""The MEDIUM,"" in which she plays a wife, mother and psychic all rolled up into one, although she does not sport the fashion flair of Mena Suvari playing her former self in SONNY.  In the scene where Carol tells Sonny that she's leaving him for a man (TROY) who will marry her, he's standing there shaving with a big blue towel knotted incredibly low on his waist.  I kept thinking, one of two things would happen--a frazzled Sonny was going to take the razor away from his soapy face and slash poor Carol with it; or b, somehow the towel would fall away, or maybe that was just wishful thinking.  How tall is Mena Suvari anyhow?  In the swingers scene where she and Sonny have sex with two middle aged and unattractive parents, the little children run in afterwards, happy to see their mom and dad.  Mena Suvari stands there, directed to seem awkward, but it is shocking how five and eight year old kids look bigger than she does.As for Brenda Blethyn or whatever her name is, she is simply terrible.  So terrible it makes you rethink all her previous performances and chalk them up to dumb luck, because no one could be so bad without actually being bad--in fact evil.  Harry Dean Stanton wears that pork pie hat as though he were born to the role, but why oh why does the music have to telegraph everything that happena to him?  But how about Scott Caan, playing Jesse?  Sonny and Jesse served together in the Army or whatever, and when they got out Jesse told Sonny that his dad would have a job waiting for them both in the family bookstore (!!!)--however when Sonny gets to Texas he finds out that creditors shut down the bookstore, cancer done took away the life of Scott Caan's dad, and all that is left of the bookstore idea is one book--Camus' STRANGER.

753732,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00009K011,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 9]","&quot;Sonny,&quot; Nicholas Cage's debut work as director, is about the titular man (James Franco, &quot;Spider-man&quot;) who has returned from army to his hometown, New Orleans.  The time is 1981, and in front of the house he stops, to meet his mother again (played by over-the-top Brenda Blethyn).  And Sonny, fed with his previous life as gigolo in there, confesses that he is going to have a day job in another city.Now you get the drift of the story.  You see, Sonny will find the tough reality, and the easier way of life is more congenial to him.  And there is a love interest, love possibly a true one, in a girl played by Mena Suvari.  Against the backdrop of the streets of New Orleans, Sonny tries to find the meaning of life in his easy lifestyle.The purpose of the film is honorable, but the result is nothing remarkable.  The problem is, sorry to say, the directions of Nick Cage, who let the actors indulge in each scene too much.  The emotional tensions between characters do not go up; the story is too slow, and the result is too predictale.  And most of all. the bad acting from many.  I don't name names, but when the character looks laughing when he is supposed to be crying, there is something seriously wrong with that.But there is one great thing about &quot;Sonny,&quot; and that is Harry Dean Stanton, who plays &quot;Henry&quot; a perpetual loser, who gets so accustomed to being loser that one small win at a card game (against Seymore Cassel) literally sends him to the Heaven.  Into Henry's weather-beaten face and down-trodden life, Harry Dean Stanton infuses the life, and even something sublime and noble.  Simply great.According to the press material, the script was offered to Nick Cage about 15 years ago (as actor), and that explains the similar atmosphere to the 80s films like &quot;American Gigolo.&quot;  Like that film, &quot;Sonny&quot; shows the languid feeling of the anti-hero, but finally goes nowhere.",2,Cage' Disappointing Debut as Director;Still Stanton is Great,1087430400,"06 17, 2004",2004,1950,"['quot', 'Sonny', 'quot', 'Nicholas', 'Cage', 'debut', 'work', 'director', 'titular', 'man', 'James', 'Franco', 'quot', 'Spider-man', 'quot', 'who', 'returned', 'army', 'hometown', 'New', 'Orleans', 'time', '1981', 'front', 'house', 'meet', 'mother', 'again', 'played', 'over-the-top', 'Brenda', 'Blethyn', 'Sonny', 'fed', 'previous', 'life', 'gigolo', 'there', 'going', 'have', 'day', 'job', 'city.Now', 'get', 'drift', 'story', 'see', 'Sonny', 'will', 'find', 'tough', 'reality', 'easier', 'way', 'life', 'more', 'congenial', 'love', 'interest', 'love', 'possibly', 'true', 'one', 'girl', 'played', 'Mena', 'Suvari', 'backdrop', 'streets', 'New', 'Orleans', 'Sonny', 'find', 'meaning', 'life', 'easy', 'lifestyle.The', 'purpose', 'film', 'honorable', 'result', 'nothing', 'remarkable', 'problem', 'sorry', 'say', 'directions', 'Nick', 'Cage', 'who', 'let', 'actors', 'indulge', 'scene', 'too', 'much', 'emotional', 'tensions', 'characters', 'do', 'not', 'go', 'up', 'story', 'too', 'slow', 'result', 'too', 'predictale', 'most', 'bad', 'acting', 'many', 'do', ""n't"", 'name', 'names', 'when', 'character', 'laughing', 'when', 'supposed', 'be', 'crying', 'something', 'seriously', 'wrong', 'that.But', 'one', 'great', 'thing', 'quot', 'Sonny', 'quot', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'who', 'quot', 'Henry', 'quot', 'perpetual', 'loser', 'who', 'so', 'accustomed', 'being', 'loser', 'one', 'small', 'win', 'card', 'game', 'Seymore', 'Cassel', 'literally', 'Heaven', 'Into', 'Henry', 'weather-beaten', 'face', 'down-trodden', 'life', 'Harry', 'Dean', 'Stanton', 'life', 'even', 'something', 'sublime', 'noble', 'Simply', 'great.According', 'press', 'material', 'script', 'was', 'offered', 'Nick', 'Cage', '15', 'years', 'ago', 'actor', 'similar', 'atmosphere', '80s', 'films', 'quot', 'American', 'Gigolo.', 'quot', 'film', 'quot', 'Sonny', 'quot', 'languid', 'feeling', 'anti-hero', 'finally', 'nowhere']",Sonny
