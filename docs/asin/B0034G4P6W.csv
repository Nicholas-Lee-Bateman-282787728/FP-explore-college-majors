It's a good example of the exploitation many musicians and actors experience in their journey toward stardom. People often give up their lives to achieve their dreams or become a success, but there's often a big price to pay. The movie was produced by Joan Jett, based on a book by Cherie Currie, so I find it believable that it's (hopefully) a fairly accurate account of the quick rise and fall of the Runaways.The fact that a group of high school aged girls experienced this is what is so amazing to me. Kim Fowley undoubtedly got them there, but if this story holds any truth then he was a total slimeball for blatantly exploiting them sexually and promoting them as ""jail bait."" As the saying goes, sex sells. And maybe ""you gotta sell your soul for rock and roll,"" but these girls were just kids who were given an offer many people would not hesitate to refuse. Especially someone like Joan Jett, who was apparently just like me growing up: I lived and breathed music, and an opportunity like that would have been the moment I had been living for.It bothered me that Lita Ford was given barely a shred of recognition. She deserves credit for being one of the small group of female rock guitarists who got noticed for their talent in a male-dominated industry. I was left with the impression that she was not liked by Jett or Currie, and they were simply thrown together by their producer and tried to tolerate each other. They could have at least given her a few lines at the end when they showed the brief synopses of what happened to the characters afterward. In the grand scheme of things this was a brief moment in the lives of Jett and Currie, so maybe they wanted to focus on their personal perspective of the events.I knew ahead of time that Jett and Currie coached the lead actresses in their roles, so I went in with some confidence that they were going to do good character portrayals. I've never been a big fan of Kristen Stewart, but she nailed the performance and was convincing in the role of Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning is never disappoints me, and I think she outdid herself once again and proved that she can take on just about any character no matter how diverse. I suppose I can see why they created a fictional bassist - since they went through several of them during that short period of time - but it was disappointing for me to see a talented actress like Alia Shawkat in the role of a character that hardly uttered a word. I know ... it was her choice to do it.If you appreciate the significant contributions that certain bands have made in the history of music - whether or not you're a fan - you will probably enjoy this movie.",4,I was impressed,1283299200,"09 1, 2010",2010,2684,"['really', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'good', 'example', 'exploitation', 'many', 'musicians', 'actors', 'experience', 'journey', 'stardom', 'People', 'often', 'give', 'up', 'lives', 'achieve', 'dreams', 'become', 'success', 'often', 'big', 'price', 'pay', 'movie', 'was', 'produced', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'based', 'book', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'find', 'believable', 'hopefully', 'fairly', 'accurate', 'account', 'quick', 'rise', 'fall', 'Runaways.The', 'fact', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'aged', 'girls', 'experienced', 'what', 'so', 'amazing', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'undoubtedly', 'got', 'there', 'story', 'truth', 'then', 'was', 'total', 'slimeball', 'blatantly', 'exploiting', 'sexually', 'promoting', 'jail', 'bait', 'saying', 'sex', 'maybe', 'got', 'ta', 'sell', 'soul', 'rock', 'roll', 'girls', 'were', 'just', 'kids', 'who', 'were', 'given', 'offer', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'not', 'hesitate', 'refuse', 'Especially', 'someone', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'who', 'was', 'apparently', 'just', 'growing', 'up', 'lived', 'breathed', 'music', 'opportunity', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'moment', 'had', 'been', 'living', 'for.It', 'bothered', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'was', 'given', 'barely', 'shred', 'recognition', 'credit', 'being', 'one', 'small', 'group', 'female', 'rock', 'guitarists', 'who', 'got', 'noticed', 'talent', 'male-dominated', 'industry', 'was', 'left', 'impression', 'was', 'not', 'liked', 'Jett', 'Currie', 'were', 'simply', 'thrown', 'together', 'producer', 'tried', 'tolerate', 'other', 'could', 'have', 'least', 'given', 'few', 'lines', 'end', 'when', 'showed', 'brief', 'synopses', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'afterward', 'grand', 'scheme', 'things', 'was', 'brief', 'moment', 'lives', 'Jett', 'Currie', 'so', 'maybe', 'wanted', 'focus', 'personal', 'perspective', 'events.I', 'knew', 'ahead', 'time', 'Jett', 'Currie', 'coached', 'lead', 'actresses', 'roles', 'went', 'confidence', 'were', 'going', 'do', 'good', 'character', 'portrayals', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'nailed', 'performance', 'was', 'convincing', 'role', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'never', 'disappoints', 'think', 'outdid', 'once', 'again', 'proved', 'can', 'take', 'just', 'character', 'matter', 'how', 'diverse', 'suppose', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'created', 'fictional', 'bassist', 'went', 'several', 'short', 'period', 'time', 'was', 'disappointing', 'see', 'talented', 'actress', 'Alia', 'Shawkat', 'role', 'character', 'hardly', 'uttered', 'word', 'know', 'was', 'choice', 'do', 'it.If', 'appreciate', 'significant', 'contributions', 'certain', 'bands', 'have', 'made', 'history', 'music', 'not', ""'re"", 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

There is one scene that I can remember featuring Lita Ford, where she gets fed up with Cherie Currie's lack of commitment to the band and tells her off in the studio. Even the ending of the movie, where they have text on the screen saying what happened to the band members, only mentions Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, and producer Kim Fowley; which is strange, because Lita and Joan both went on to have big solo careers.  It is almost like Lita Ford was purposely written out of the movie, which makes no sense because she was an accomplished guitarist and her and Joan held the band together for years despite Currie's personal issues.  And when Joan had to take over playing bass for a while, it was all Lita on guitars.  Most people today probably haven't even heard of the other members of The Runaways besides Lita Ford and Joan Jett.  The only thing I can figure is that Lita was not as dysfunctional as some of the other members of the band, and thus her life was not as colorful from a Hollywood perspective.  Too bad.

I LOVE Dakota Fanning, but I kind of loathe both Michael Shannon and Kristen Stewart.  I don't really know much about the band to begin with, so my interest level had mainly to do with Dakota finally getting a juicy role and the reviews to match (when is this girl going to get an Oscar nomination?) and so I dived in, expecting to be marginally entertained.The movie was really good.The film itself really lives and breathes in two areas, Fanning's marvelously matured performance and the sharp, totally lived in editing.  The story and overall construction of the film (pacing and plot points) are familiar to the genre and won't leave you shocked or wholly amazed, but the way that the film is spun by director Floria Sigismondi is a really nice touch.  It adds a whole new dimension to the film, giving it an alluring quality.  Yes, the film is designed to keep the boys entertained, with jailbait fawning all over the screen (Dakota made me feel so dirty) but it works; serving its purpose beautifully.  The lighting, the mood, the music blaring over every sequence; the film really has its own personality.The story of Joan Jett and Cherie Currie is exploited with ease here.  After a chance meeting with Kim Fowley, a disgustingly vulgar music producer, Joan finally sees her dreams coming together.  She wants an all girl rock band, and her determination coupled with Cherie's sex appeal is certainly going to make that happen.BUT...there is always a but; isn't there.Rather than focus on the band as a whole, the film is really only concerned with Joan and Cherie, which is to be expected and happens to be common practice with films in this genre.  I would have loved a little more elaboration on the other band members, and maybe less concern with Kim Fowley (beings that Michael Shannon annoys me to no end) but I can't really complain too much.  The film is so drastically chaotic in texture that is sucks you right in and keeps you glued to every frame.But believe the word of mouth on these girls here.  Even Kristen Stewart delivers remarkably here.  I would have never expected this from her, but she really understands underlining the real emotional blemishes of Joan, and she handles it with ease.  But Dakota, dear god...she's a total CHERRY BOMB!  She just milks this performance for all that its worth.  She's always carried an otherworldly demeanor about herself, but she adds so much spice and sex and charm to this performance; easily the best of her career.So watch the film; you'll like it more than you think you will.",4,"The glitz, the glam; the girls...",1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2605,"['did', ""n't"", 'really', 'expect', 'whole', 'lot', 'Runaways', 'LOVE', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'kind', 'loathe', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'much', 'band', 'begin', 'interest', 'level', 'had', 'mainly', 'do', 'Dakota', 'finally', 'getting', 'juicy', 'role', 'reviews', 'match', 'when', 'girl', 'going', 'get', 'Oscar', 'nomination', 'so', 'dived', 'expecting', 'be', 'marginally', 'entertained.The', 'movie', 'was', 'really', 'good.The', 'film', 'really', 'breathes', 'two', 'areas', 'Fanning', 'marvelously', 'matured', 'performance', 'sharp', 'totally', 'lived', 'editing', 'story', 'overall', 'construction', 'film', 'pacing', 'plot', 'points', 'are', 'familiar', 'genre', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'shocked', 'wholly', 'amazed', 'way', 'film', 'spun', 'director', 'Floria', 'Sigismondi', 'really', 'nice', 'touch', 'whole', 'new', 'dimension', 'film', 'giving', 'alluring', 'quality', 'Yes', 'film', 'designed', 'keep', 'boys', 'entertained', 'jailbait', 'fawning', 'screen', 'Dakota', 'made', 'feel', 'so', 'dirty', 'serving', 'purpose', 'beautifully', 'lighting', 'mood', 'music', 'blaring', 'sequence', 'film', 'really', 'own', 'personality.The', 'story', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'exploited', 'ease', 'here', 'chance', 'meeting', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'disgustingly', 'vulgar', 'music', 'producer', 'Joan', 'finally', 'dreams', 'coming', 'together', 'girl', 'rock', 'band', 'determination', 'coupled', 'Cherie', 'sex', 'appeal', 'certainly', 'going', 'make', 'happen.BUT', 'always', ""n't"", 'there.Rather', 'focus', 'band', 'whole', 'film', 'really', 'only', 'concerned', 'Joan', 'Cherie', 'be', 'expected', 'be', 'common', 'practice', 'films', 'genre', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'little', 'more', 'elaboration', 'other', 'band', 'members', 'maybe', 'less', 'concern', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'beings', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'really', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'film', 'so', 'drastically', 'chaotic', 'texture', 'sucks', 'right', 'keeps', 'glued', 'frame.But', 'believe', 'word', 'mouth', 'girls', 'here', 'Even', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'remarkably', 'here', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'expected', 'really', 'underlining', 'real', 'emotional', 'blemishes', 'Joan', 'ease', 'Dakota', 'dear', 'god', 'total', 'CHERRY', 'BOMB', 'just', 'milks', 'performance', 'worth', 'always', 'carried', 'otherworldly', 'demeanor', 'so', 'much', 'spice', 'sex', 'charm', 'performance', 'easily', 'best', 'career.So', 'watch', 'film', ""'ll"", 'like', 'more', 'think', 'will']",N/A

They spoof it or they just write material that has you saying ""Yeah, Right!"" as you shake your head in disbelief....This film does NOT. Dakota Fanning and Kristin Stewart are very convincing in their roles. I had forgotten how much fun parties could be and was glad to be reminded. The music of the Runaways is not my favorite music from the era, but I follwed Lita and Joan's solo careers after the Runaways....I learned a lot from this movie. My years were spent reading Circus magazines and listening to a lot of rock and roll, and I knew of the Runaways purely through those mediums. It was interesting to see this film, fill in the ""blanks"".I was pleasantly surprised to see that Cherie was a Bowie fan. Being a Bowie fan myself in high school, I know that was like a ""badge of distinction"". Many of my friends guys and girls had ""no interest"" in Bowie or Iggy orany of the glam starsof the time.

I thought the first third of the film was great, an accurate depiction of restless teenage life in stoner-delic late-'70s suburbia. Add this film to the (very) short list of films that get the 'Seventies right, alongside ""Dazed And Confused"" and, um... well, that's about the whole list.Unfortunately the film loses its focus and drive and devolves into a gauzy haze of fuzzy narrative. The director makes the same mistake the folks doing the ""Twilight"" films made: they all think that Kristin Stewart is so inherently charismatic and pretty that if they just let the camera linger while she stares off into space and looks vaguely angst-ridden that that will be enough to satisfy viewers. It's not. What started off as a very strong film sort of fizzles out: oh, no! The girls became famous, did bad drugs, started to quarrel and the band fell apart. And, um, stuff. And, um, maybe Joan Jett did some stuff, too. And, um, maybe Lita Ford didn't, because we forgot to mention that she had a very successful solo career all through the 'Eighties. And, um, maybe the band didn't actually completely evaporate when Cherie Currie quit, but actually soldiered on for a year or so and recorded more music, and, um, maybe that would have been more interesting to explore than having an endless string of scenes where the gamin-like Kristen Stewart mopes some more, and then mopes... some more.  I dunno. It seems like they missed an opportunity to really tell this story more effectively and more powerfully... and perhaps more honestly, as well.

Well, it does do that to an extent, but not much as I would have liked. To fill in the gaps, we're treated to make-out scenes between the girls. Niiiiiice...I guess in this day an age, that's going to be touted as the best parts of the movie.As a guitar aficianado, I was disappointed that more attention wasn't placed on Lita Ford in the movie. Female guitarists, especially in the 70's, who could play rock lead guitar as well as she could were extremely rare. I think her character deserved more of the spotlight in the story, and how she became to be so good and all, rather than focus so much on the personal relationship between Jett and Currie. Lita Ford did achieve some success in the 80's as an artist (more than Currie did, for sure), so she shouldn't be considered as relatively unimportant. I realize that Currie and Jett are meant to be the two main characters in the movie, but I just wish we could have seen a more detailed story about the musicianship of the other members of the band. Nothing is shown or explained how Ford and the bass player joined the band. EDIT: Another reviewer pointed out that this movie is based on Currie's autobiography, which explains why so much screen time is devoted to her character. In light of this, I think that titling the movie ""The Runaways"" is somewhat misleading, as it made me think that the band itself was going to be the gist of the story, not so much Currie specifically.So yeah, forget about this movie being much in common with ""The Buddy Holly Story"" or ""La Bamba."" It definitely has a much darker vibe. The only comic relief comes from the entertaining and witty one-liners rattled off by Kim Fowley when he's trying to motivate the group during rehearsals.Overall, though, a pretty good movie, particularly if you're a Runaways fan.",3,Not for Hannah Montana fans...,1280361600,"07 29, 2010",2010,2265,"['Anyone', 'interested', 'movie', 'who', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'Runaways', 'be', 'warned', 'not', 'group', 'Hannah', 'Montana-type', 'girls', 'Indeed', 'movie', 'pretty', 'dang', 'sleazy', 'How', 'so', 'Well', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'away', 'as', 'much', 'attention', 'focused', 'girls', 'playing', 'playing', 'guitars', 'was', 'hoping', 'would', 'be', 'normal', 'musical', 'bio-pic', 'legendary', 'band', '70', 'how', 'group', 'rose', 'fell', 'scene', 'Well', 'do', 'extent', 'not', 'much', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'fill', 'gaps', ""'re"", 'treated', 'make-out', 'scenes', 'girls', 'Niiiiiice', 'guess', 'day', 'age', 'going', 'be', 'touted', 'best', 'parts', 'movie.As', 'guitar', 'aficianado', 'was', 'disappointed', 'more', 'attention', 'was', ""n't"", 'placed', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'movie', 'Female', 'guitarists', 'especially', '70', 'who', 'could', 'play', 'rock', 'lead', 'guitar', 'as', 'well', 'could', 'were', 'extremely', 'rare', 'think', 'character', 'deserved', 'more', 'spotlight', 'story', 'how', 'became', 'be', 'so', 'good', 'rather', 'focus', 'so', 'much', 'personal', 'relationship', 'Jett', 'Currie', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'did', 'achieve', 'success', '80', 'artist', 'more', 'Currie', 'did', 'sure', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'considered', 'relatively', 'unimportant', 'realize', 'Currie', 'Jett', 'are', 'meant', 'be', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'movie', 'just', 'wish', 'could', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'detailed', 'story', 'musicianship', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'Nothing', 'shown', 'explained', 'how', 'Ford', 'bass', 'player', 'joined', 'band', 'EDIT', 'reviewer', 'pointed', 'out', 'movie', 'based', 'Currie', 'autobiography', 'why', 'so', 'much', 'screen', 'time', 'devoted', 'character', 'light', 'think', 'titling', 'movie', 'Runaways', 'somewhat', 'misleading', 'made', 'think', 'band', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'gist', 'story', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'Currie', 'specifically.So', 'yeah', 'forget', 'movie', 'being', 'much', 'common', 'Buddy', 'Holly', 'Story', 'La', 'Bamba', 'definitely', 'much', 'darker', 'vibe', 'only', 'comic', 'relief', 'entertaining', 'witty', 'one-liners', 'rattled', 'off', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'when', 'trying', 'motivate', 'group', 'rehearsals.Overall', 'though', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'particularly', ""'re"", 'Runaways', 'fan']",N/A

E Jackson,"[1, 1]","The Runaways does a magnificent job giving us an exciting, party-filled history lesson pertaining to one of the heaviest and influential female rock bands of the 70's- the Runaways.You *could* argue that Heart or Blondie rocks just as aggressively and deserve a film of their own as well, but I guess that's beside the point.  Besides, I doubt in the case of Heart at least, they had anywhere near as many adventurous stories the members of the Runaways did.The one thing that really surprised me while watching however, is that not a whole lot of focus is given to Lita Ford.  Those of us who remember the glory days of the 80's will recall she had quite the successful solo career, so the storyline is lacking a bit in that regard.  Some of us really wanted to know more about Lita Ford during her days with the Runaways.A fair amount of attention is understandably given to Joan Jett given her enormously popular 80's career, but it seemed to be split between her and Cherie Currie for the most part (with Currie edging out Jett as far as the detailed aspect of the storytelling, with the subject of Currie's family getting significant attention).  Meanwhile Joan Jett's family wasn't even mentioned... perhaps there's a good reason for that (she WAS definitely portrayed as a cautious outsider, and didn't seem to want many, if any, friends).  Perhaps this was due to the fact she didn't have a family, I don't really know.The other two female members of the band got NO attention whatsoever, and were basically outright ignored.  Sort of unforgivable but I won't deduct a point just because of it (though I'm tempted to).I loved the music selection, but where in the world was ""Born To Be Bad?""  That's GOTTA be my favorite Runaways song because of the Sabbath-sludgy guitar during the chorus, and the chorus itself for that matter.  Oh well, at least ""Cherry Bomb"" got a fair amount of exposure, and in addition to that, we actually found out how the song originated.  Cool little bit of information there.An enormous amount of attention is given to the fact these girls not only partied, but partied *hard* and *frequently*.  They did all kinds of drugs during concerts, airplane rides, and even in the comfort of their own home.  This subject is touched upon heavily.Also, it's hard for me to recommend this movie to those younger than 18 because there's a *ton* of vulgar scenes involving sex, and the foul language is pretty much nonstop.  It's completely dominant, in fact.  Most of it comes from their record manager, who constantly talks to the girls the same way men usually talk to each other- you know, disgustingly!Besides that, the storyline is good, the music is excellent, and the band is legendary.",5,"fun, but not recommended for everyone",1298073600,"02 19, 2011",2011,2719,"['Runaways', 'magnificent', 'job', 'giving', 'exciting', 'party-filled', 'history', 'lesson', 'pertaining', 'one', 'heaviest', 'influential', 'female', 'rock', 'bands', ""70's-"", 'Runaways.You', '*could*', 'argue', 'Heart', 'Blondie', 'just', 'aggressively', 'deserve', 'film', 'own', 'as', 'well', 'guess', 'beside', 'point', 'doubt', 'case', 'Heart', 'least', 'had', 'anywhere', 'near', 'many', 'adventurous', 'stories', 'members', 'Runaways', 'did.The', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'surprised', 'watching', 'however', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'focus', 'given', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'who', 'remember', 'glory', 'days', '80', 'will', 'recall', 'had', 'quite', 'successful', 'solo', 'career', 'storyline', 'lacking', 'bit', 'regard', 'really', 'wanted', 'know', 'more', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'days', 'Runaways.A', 'fair', 'amount', 'attention', 'understandably', 'given', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'given', 'enormously', 'popular', '80', 'career', 'seemed', 'be', 'split', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'most', 'part', 'Currie', 'edging', 'out', 'Jett', 'as', 'far', 'detailed', 'aspect', 'storytelling', 'subject', 'Currie', 'family', 'getting', 'significant', 'attention', 'Meanwhile', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'family', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'mentioned', 'perhaps', 'good', 'reason', 'WAS', 'definitely', 'portrayed', 'cautious', 'outsider', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'want', 'many', 'friends', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'due', 'fact', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'family', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know.The', 'other', 'two', 'female', 'members', 'band', 'got', 'attention', 'whatsoever', 'were', 'basically', 'outright', 'ignored', 'Sort', 'unforgivable', 'wo', ""n't"", 'deduct', 'point', 'just', ""'m"", 'tempted', '.I', 'loved', 'music', 'selection', 'where', 'world', 'was', 'Born', 'Be', 'Bad', 'GOT', 'TA', 'be', 'favorite', 'Runaways', 'song', 'Sabbath-sludgy', 'guitar', 'chorus', 'chorus', 'matter', 'Oh', 'well', 'least', 'Cherry', 'Bomb', 'got', 'fair', 'amount', 'exposure', 'addition', 'actually', 'found', 'how', 'song', 'originated', 'Cool', 'little', 'bit', 'information', 'there.An', 'enormous', 'amount', 'attention', 'given', 'fact', 'girls', 'not', 'only', 'partied', 'partied', '*hard*', '*frequently*', 'did', 'kinds', 'drugs', 'concerts', 'airplane', 'rides', 'even', 'comfort', 'own', 'home', 'subject', 'touched', 'heavily.Also', 'hard', 'recommend', 'movie', 'younger', '18', '*ton*', 'vulgar', 'scenes', 'involving', 'sex', 'foul', 'language', 'pretty', 'much', 'nonstop', 'completely', 'dominant', 'fact', 'Most', 'record', 'manager', 'who', 'constantly', 'girls', 'same', 'way', 'men', 'usually', 'talk', 'other-', 'know', 'disgustingly', 'storyline', 'good', 'music', 'excellent', 'band', 'legendary']",N/A

So I was not particularly surprised that, when my long-awaited copy of ""The Runaways"" arrived in the mail yesterday, and Dearest and I had a ""share a DVD"" night last evening, I was ""regaled"" with accusations of pedophilia.  Dearest missed the point completely. Dakota Fanning and Kristin Stewart do an astounding job of portraying Cherie Currie and Joan Jett, being the exact same ages that the Runaways were when they first burst upon the national musical consciousness - PLUS the Runaways were originally conceived by their ""manager,"" the insufferable Kim Fowley, to actually BE ""jailbait rock,"" for lack of a better way to phrase it.  And as is Hollywood's wont, the movie itself basically took two or three ""points in the Runaways career,"" blew them up almost pornographically, WAY out of porportion, and not-really-correct time sequentially.  Still:  I was an active performing musician myself in 1975, and I WELL rememeber the advent of the Runaways, just as interest in limp-wristed ""soft rock"" was waning (I won't mention any names, Amazon), and ""disco"" and ""punk"" were just starting to herald the imminent demise of rock and roll.  And despite, with the exception of Joan Jett, any discernable ""talent,"" the Runaways WERE a breath of fresh air in an era fraught with the likes of ""Ain't No Way To Treat Lady,"" ""Best Of My Love,"" or ""Holdin' On To Yesterday"" - AND (this is coming from a testosterone-soaked ""standpoint"") they were mightily pleasing to look at. ""The Runaways"" (movie) captures all this and more; my only real point of contention is that the odious Fowley was portayed by Michael Shannon (and really, not too badly, either), when most everyone to whom I've spoken, and all Runaways (the band) fans, concede that Michael Des Barres would have been a better choice.

The performances by Kristin Stewart who seems to be channeling even Joan Jett's body language, Dakota Fanning (who knew she could sing!) and Michael Shannon as in a completely over-the-top performance as the notorious and legendary band manager/music producer Kim Fowley are spectacular.The movie itself features a heck of a lot of boring drawnout scenes especially the club scenes, the drug taking that overtakes the last third of the movie which, if you get bored by then just fast-forward, and the ""family"" scenes involving only Cherie Currie's family (starring an unrecognizable and gratuitous Tatum O'Neal). It seems the other band members did not have families as we never see theirs at all during the entire story.The stuff on the road is a drag because, frankly, if you've ever been in a band or hung out with a band, its just is. I'm sure it was put into the movie to show the loneliness of the road hence the drug taking to relieve the boredom. Then again it was the '70s and the band were taking drugs anyway back when they were at ""home"" in California.For the acting alone and for the extra on the behind-the-scenes where the real Cherie Currie shows up and looks simply stunning now 30+ years later and not a rock 'n' roll casualty (thank the rock gods for that) this is worth a rental.Having said that I did not get the whole Runaways as pioneers for female rock. Maybe they were but I grew up in the '70s and never gave the Runaways a thought.

I wasn't really a Runaways fan but I loved Joan Jett.  I jumped on her bandwagon when the ""I Love Rock'N' Roll' phenomenon hit which led me to her debut release, ""Bad Reputation"", previously available only on import until she hit it big.  The only time I saw her live was in the winter of 1985 with ""The Glorious Results of a Misspent Youth"" tour where she headlined with the Ramones.  The Runaways were never anything more than a niche band or a curiousity whose greatest success was overseas.  What this film argues successfully is that, if anything, they were pioneers for woman rockers.  The success of Chrissie Hynde and the Go-Gos, among many others, is almost unimaginable without the ground laid by the Runaways.  The film presents the point that the inner workings of rock is a dirty business not for the faint of heart.  At the center of the film are the core members of the Runaways, the beautiful but fragile Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) and the tough but determined Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart).  The Runaways, the film argues, were doomed from the start because they were treated by their handlers as nothing more than a cheap novelty and a disposable commodity.  That said the film ends on a hopeful note showing Currie's recovery from her harrowing experience and Jett dusting herself off and rocking into the next millenium. Fanning is excellent in portraying the delicacy of Currie but Stewart makes her mark as Jett by channelling the ferosity and smarts that are Joan's essence.  This may be the best screen portrayal of a rock icon since Val Kilmer embodied Jim Morrison in ""The Doors"".  Not to be overlooked is Michael Shannon's portayal of Kim Fowley whose part Svengali and part Malcolm McLaren who treats his ""creation"" with more contempt and loathing than adulation.

I was originally going to purchase it and then saw it for free viewing on Netflix.  All I can say is I'm glad I didn't waste my money.  It's bad enough that I wasted the time to click the ""play"" button on the screen and the time it took to watch the crap that followed.  Basically what I saw was not the story of the band featuring two of my favorite female rockers (Jett and Ford) that I was expecting, but rather someone trying to make money by throwing a bunch of profanity together and calling it a script.  The only appearance of the Lita Ford character that I saw was her cussing at the Joan Jett character and Joan cussing back.  That's the way Hollywood works these days (when they aren't butchering classics in their god awful remakes) if they can't come up with something for the script, they have the characters start shouting four letter words.  The girl who portrayed Joan I later found out is the girl from the abomination to vampire films, Twilight.  And seeing her constantly trying to make out with Dakota Fanning throughout the film was disturbing to say the least.  Dakota Fanning's presence here proves what they say about child stars.  Once they start to get older, nobody wants to see them anymore because they're no longer ""cute"" and they start grasping at whatever scripts come their way, usually trying to take ""shocking"" roles to attempt to shock everyone into liking them again.  I can not with a clear conscience recommend this miserable excuse for a movie to anyone.

Amith (kndy),"[6, 7]","Years before Joan Jett was rocking on MTV  with her mega hit ""I Love Rock n' Roll"" and Lita Ford with ""Kiss Me Deadly"", there was The Runaways, the all-female rock band that took Japan by storm (and also achieved recognition in the US) during the the mid-to-late '70s and would eventually open up doors for female rockers and showing that these young teens can rock on stage and also can make great music!VIDEO:""The Runaways"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1) and sports a vibrant and colorful pallet.  It's a very colorful film with scenes that tend to experiment on various cuts especially during the band member's drugged out euphoria.  There is a good amount of grain present in the film which was very cool and the blacks were nice and deep.  From Kristen Stewart's black hair ala Joan Jett to the black leather jacket or the hot pink  jacket, to Dakota Fanning ala Cherie Currie in her red outfit or her black lingerie, colors really come together in this film and is presented very well in HD.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""The Runaways"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS HD-MA.  For the most part, the film contains a lot of dialogue which is center and front channel driven, I wasn't expecting too much in terms ambient sounds in the background but I did expect more from the concert sequences during the film.The concert portions definitely utilize the surrounds especially scenes with crowds but I didn't really notice any significant use of the low frequency or rear surrounds.  But overall, dialogue and music is clear but it would have been great to have more of an immersive lossless soundtrack for the concert portions.Subtitles are in English and English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""The Runaways"" comes with the following special features (in HD, English Stereo with English subtitles):* movieIQ(tm)+sync featuring ""The Runaways"" Playlist - While watching the film, you can have playlists and websites e-mailed to you.* Commentary with Joan Jett, Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning - A very interesting audio commentary.  Joan Jett giving us some idea of what she remembers in reality compared to the film, Kristen Stewart absolutely blunt about what she liked about the film and scenes that she didn't like and Dakota Fanning discussing various scenes that she took part in and the challenges.* Plugged In: Making the Film - (15:37) Author (and former The Runaways vocalist) Cherie Currie talks about how her book became a film.  Interviews with the director, producers and talent in regards to the film and bringing the life of The Runaways to the big screen.* The Runaways - (2:19) A short featurette about ""The Runaways"" and interviews with the main talent.JUDGMENT CALL:May you be the young at heart, reminiscing of that time when you first heard of The Runaways music or discovering a band that opened the doors for many female rockers, The Runaways represented a time when an all-female band was non-existent.And The Runaways received recognition for their ""screw you; we do what want!"" style of attitude.  Heavy hitting music, a visual style (each member demonstrated their own style visually and musically) and for any rock n' roll fan, you can't help but just be in awe of what these young ladies at the time accomplished.I personally enjoyed ""The Runaways"".  I grew up around the time, heard it on the radio as a child and having been a fan of Joan Jett and Lita Ford's work, I was definitely highly anticipating the film after I saw the preview trailers.And I wasn't disappointed at all.  Especially showing how these young teenagers at the time wanted to defy what the public thought of rock n' roll being a man's world.  So, it was good to see how life was for the band in the beginning and unfortunately, through the turmoil that ended the band.It's important to note that this film is an adaptation of Cherie Currie's book ""Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway"" and it's not really a biopic in the sense of life for the five members of the band.  It focuses on Currie and Joan Jett (who was the Executive Producer of the film) and due to the bad blood that still exists within the band members, Lita Ford made it clear she has nothing to do with this film.And also because of a legal suit between Joan Jett and Jackie Fox, Fox also had no involvement in the film (it's important to also note that Jackie Fox's name was changed to a generic bassist named Robin). Drummer Sandy West passed away in 2006 after a long battle with lung cancer but her rights were given to the making of the film alongside band manager Kim Fowley.Needless to say, the drama between the band members continue to exist today and thus, the film's script had to be modified.  And although based on the perspective of Cherie Currie, Currie admits that certain parts of the film didn't happen the same way in real life and Joan Jett has concurred.  But emphasized that the film does capture what the band did go through and how female rockers proved to the music world that they can do it  and also showcasing the pitfalls of being a rockstar and also exploring one's own sexuality.But I really enjoyed the film and its overall look and feel.  Granted, there is no way Kristen Stewart can replace Joan Jett but she sure does do a good job trying to emulate the rockstar on stage and onscreen.  According to the audio commentary, Stewart watched her videos on YouTube and by listening to her comments, she was very astute in her obervations of how various members of the group interacted, walked and performed on stage, especially Fanning's performance as Cherie Currie.As for Dakota Fanning, this is where it's hard for me to comment on the actress's performance because I've watched a lot of Joan Jett interviews and performances in my lifetime to know and see how the attitude and passion for the rock music was emulated by Stewart but I really didn't know anything about Currie outside of the music.  But I will say that I have always admired Fanning's commitment as an actress even when she was young and now as we watch her as a teenager.It's easy to forget that these young women were in their teens when they began The Runaways and while watching the film and seeing them embrace the sex, drugs and rock n' roll, they seem much mature for their years especially when I see their performance in 1977 in Japan.  While watching the actresses take on their real-life counterparts onscreen, while Currie seemed much more mature, Fanning looked as a teenager who got caught up into the rockstar lifestyle and nearly was consumed by it.As for the music performances by the ladies, as mentioned earlier, there is no way Stewart and Fanning can come close to the originals.  Currie had so much fire and sexuality in her voice and while Stewart did a remarkable job, Joan Jett is such a magnificent performer that she's hard to emulate.  In fact, Stewart even takes some jabs at some her scenes that seem out of place in the film during the audio commentary.It's a shame that the other women of the band had no part in the film and that some of the members have been estranged from each other for decades, because it would have been good to see how Lita Ford and Jackie Fox would have contributed to the film and perhaps we would have gotten a true biopic of the actual band from all members points of view than just focusing on Currie and parts of Jett.Also, it would have been nice for the film to at least give acknowledgment to the other two members and showing what they have done with their lives (Lita Ford went on to become a successful solo artist and Jackie Fox went on to become a lawyer) and possibly the most surprising is no dedication to Sandy West (even the talent and Joan Jett were surprised by not seeing a dedication in the credits as discussed in the audio commentary).But overall, despite not being a true biopic of the band and a film based on Cherie Currie's book and perspective, I was pleased by ""The Runaways"" and enjoyed it.  Love the vibrant visuals, trippy drugged out scenes and that '70s rock vibe.  And of course, for anyone who grew up listening to The Runaways and music of that time, just hearing it again and seeing it onscreen without it being to schlocky or kitschy.I was really getting into the music of the film and since watching the film, have been listening and watching old '70s performances by the band online and even now wanting to buy the original soundtrack for the film.  The Blu-ray release doesn't have too many special features but the audio commentary was definitely entertaining.If you are a fan of the Runaways, their music or wanting to watch an enjoyable rock n' roll film, definitely give ""The Runaways"" a chance!",4,"Blu-ray: Although not a true biopic, the film is quite entertaining and literally rocks!",1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,8664,"['Years',

The film really focuses on these two characters, as well as the Svengali, Kim Fowley, who puts the group together and both encourages and torments the girls throughout their rise to stardom. The other three girls in the band have very minor roles ... drummer Sandy West is depicted as feisty but good-hearted, whereas Lita Ford is mostly shown as shrill and angry. And since the film was forced to create a fictitious bassist character to fill in for Jackie Fox, that character is almost completely ignored.The film's script is merely decent, but what elevates the whole thing is the trio of fantastic lead performances by Dakota Fanning, Kristen Stewart, and Michael Shannon, as well as the film's intoxicating art direction and soundtrack. A lot of former child stars try playing sexy in order to appear more mature, and it ends up looking desperate. But Dakota Fanning creates a three dimensional character, and she pulls off both the hyper sexualized stage antics of her character, as well as her sullen, self-destructive offstage behavior. Kristen Stewart is a revelation as Joan Jett, portraying all of the character's machismo, passion, awkwardness, and thoughtfulness. And Michael Shannon goes for broke playing his hilarious, over-the-top character that is a bizarre combination of nurturer and abuser toward his prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.Now if only I could get ""Cherry Bomb"" out of my head ...",4,Fun,1297641600,"02 14, 2011",2011,1645,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'was', 'going', 'enjoy', 'film', 'when', 'decided', 'watch', 'was', 'surprised', 'find', 'ended', 'up', 'absolutely', 'loving', 'it.The', 'very', 'title', 'film', 'may', 'be', 'bit', 'misleading', 'better', 'title', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'Cheri', 'Joan', 'film', 'really', 'two', 'characters', 'as', 'well', 'Svengali', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'who', 'group', 'together', 'encourages', 'girls', 'rise', 'stardom', 'other', 'three', 'girls', 'band', 'have', 'very', 'minor', 'roles', 'Sandy', 'West', 'depicted', 'feisty', 'good-hearted', 'whereas', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'mostly', 'shown', 'shrill', 'angry', 'film', 'was', 'forced', 'create', 'fictitious', 'bassist', 'character', 'fill', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'character', 'almost', 'completely', 'ignored.The', 'film', 'script', 'merely', 'decent', 'what', 'whole', 'thing', 'trio', 'fantastic', 'lead', 'performances', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'intoxicating', 'art', 'direction', 'soundtrack', 'lot', 'former', 'child', 'stars', 'try', 'playing', 'sexy', 'order', 'appear', 'more', 'mature', 'up', 'looking', 'desperate', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'three', 'dimensional', 'character', 'hyper', 'sexualized', 'stage', 'antics', 'character', 'as', 'well', 'sullen', 'self-destructive', 'offstage', 'behavior', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'revelation', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'portraying', 'character', 'machismo', 'passion', 'awkwardness', 'thoughtfulness', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'broke', 'playing', 'hilarious', 'over-the-top', 'character', 'bizarre', 'combination', 'nurturer', 'abuser', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 's.Now', 'only', 'could', 'get', 'Cherry', 'Bomb', 'head']",N/A

Of course it touches upon the turbulent friendship between Joan Jett and Cherie Currie as well as the relationship between the group and Kim Fowley. Like most movies based on a true story, there isn't much plot to describe. However, the movie raises a lot of issues that are perfect for discussion.Overall, I must say that this is the best role Kristen Stewart has ever had. I can honestly say that it was wonderful to see her in this movie. I was not as impressed with Dakota Fanning's performance which I found to be stilted at times. Overall I thought that she did a good job, but her connection to the character seemed to go in waves where sometimes she was completely in tune only to lose the spark soon after.

It was something from left field but shockingly gripping (for any music fans out there) & pure dynomite. Dakota's voice in Cherry Bomb was unimaginably dead-on, never skipped a beat, lost a breath, no...she was Cherie Churri. & I don't care what any non-Kristen Stewart fan says: This role is 100% authetic. It took on being a whole different persona, that of, the legendary Joan Jett. & It wasn't just the physical transformations that made it look so much like the actual thing, it was their presence on stage, the mannerisms of Joan Jett being perfectly echoed by Kristen Stewart who, before the film, I wouldn't have ever thought could pull off such an act. I was utterly impressed by the impersonations of both leads that I rewatched it again & again.The movie itself is about the vulgarity that is in Rock N'Roll. It doesn't try to perfect the failures of Cherie or the band itself. It simply tells the story bluntly has it happened. The Runaways weren't a band that lasted into the decades. It takes place in the 70s where they rose & crashed into stardom. Cherie wasn't your ideal 15 year old but she defintely dreamt the dream that became a reality when she met Joan Jett at a club & they hit it off with a record producer who later got them signed to Mercury Records. Cherie wasn't the most popular among her classmates. It was almost too clear that her connection to David Bowie was almost like a salvation in her eyes, than just a fad. She rebelled against what was normal by cutting her hair, painted her face like Bowie to make a stand. & She went on to never completely fit in with the band that wanted to play loud music while she liked songs like ""Stary stary night"" & ""Fever"". She hated her sister's boyfriend & didn't wanna hang out with her friends. Cherie was just a one of a kind. The face of ""The Runaways"" while Joan was the ""rock"". Has a duo they did enough to take them all the way to Japan.In general ""The Runaways"" were different, they were the first girl rock band that opened doors for every female lead & female band out there today.

Kristen Stewart plays Joans moody personal down to a tee.. Dakota Fanning played Cherie Currie to perfection.. There was not enough of Sandy West (probably the first female rock drummer) or Lita Ford's (the worlds greatest female guitarist) parts in the move.. In real life they had as much impact on the band as did Joan and Cherrie.. Dont forget Cherie's sister Marie and Vick Blue joined the line up for short periods when Cherrie went off the rails and Joan & Lita started thinking of breaking up the band.. My only problem was there was a lot of music and story left out but then the movie would have to have been 4 times longer.. I could have handled that.. They were the worlds first heavy female rock band barly out of school (when they went) and they nailed it..

It is about time they made this movie I fell in love with all the band members from the moment I saw and heard them as a youngster. I have been getting tired of all the hip hop based movies and sorry role models that are out now adays Im not saying runaways where good rol models though. I am saddened that there are not many rocker bands like when I grew up or all female bands like the Runaways. So now on to the movie, I can't say I was disappointed I don't have complaints but I have things I wish they would have done in this movie but it comes nowhere near portraying the emotions and feelings that the documentary can make you feel by hearing it directly from the band members mouths. The documentary makes my eyes water and chokes me up everytime I watch it. I'm glad I saw Edge play 1st because I would have been lost in the movie with out it. I wish they would have showed more from the beautiful and gorgeous Scout Taylor Compton who played Lita and more about Sandy West the now diciest drummer. The movie focused mainly on Cherie Curry and Joan Jet, which is not a bad thing, It seemed like a lot of chaos and just not enough time to put everything in the movie. I am really glad they finally made a movie about them and will by this movie day one when it comes out on blu ray.

I love rock & roll, Joan Jett and this movie. Being a true Joan Jett fan, I'm glad her character was protrayed very well. Joan is protrayed by Kristen Stewart. Cherie Currie (protrayed by Dakota Fanning), was the real center of this movie. Both of these actresses did a great job of protraying Joan and Cherie.This movie was based on the book ""Neon Angels"", which is based on the memiors of Cherie Currie. That is why she is the main focus of attention in this movie.This movie is about how record producer Kim Fowley (a man, not a woman, protrayed by Michael Shannon), put together this band, with Cherie Currie being the lead singer. He really put them through a lot of stress, demanding better performances, etc. He really put a lot of pressure on Cherie Currie, which finally lead to her breakdown, her rebellion against Kim Fowley, and her leaving the band, which finally resulted in it's discontinuance.It ends with Cherie Currie listing to the radio, while doing some chores, working on a job, and she hears Joan Jett & the Blackhearts on the Radio, performing ""I Love Rock & Roll"".Bonus Material: Includes a ""rockin'commentary with Joan Jett, Kristen Stewart , and Dakota Fanning"".",4,"Good Rock & Roll Movie With Main Focus on the Characters Portraying: Kim Fowley, Joan Jett & Cherie Currie!!!!",1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,1268,"['good', 'rock', 'roll', 'movie', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'fan', 'would', 'probably', 'enjoy', 'love', 'rock', 'roll', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'movie', 'Being', 'true', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'fan', ""'m"", 'glad', 'character', 'was', 'protrayed', 'very', 'well', 'Joan', 'protrayed', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'protrayed', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'was', 'real', 'center', 'movie', 'actresses', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'protraying', 'Joan', 'Cherie.This', 'movie', 'was', 'based', 'book', 'Neon', 'Angels', 'based', 'memiors', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'why', 'main', 'focus', 'attention', 'movie.This', 'movie', 'how', 'record', 'producer', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'man', 'not', 'woman', 'protrayed', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'put', 'together', 'band', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'being', 'lead', 'singer', 'really', 'put', 'lot', 'stress', 'demanding', 'better', 'performances', 'etc', 'really', 'put', 'lot', 'pressure', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'finally', 'lead', 'breakdown', 'rebellion', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'leaving', 'band', 'finally', 'resulted', 'discontinuance.It', 'ends', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'listing', 'radio', 'doing', 'chores', 'working', 'job', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Blackhearts', 'Radio', 'performing', 'Love', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'Material', ""rockin'commentary"", 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Dakota', 'Fanning']",N/A

Back in the ""old days"" there was no internet to download and ""sample"" music. You actually had to buy 45's and albums (imagine that!). As soon as I could scrape together enough ""allowance"" I bought the first album and was hooked. I went on to buy every album after that, even the 'Live in Japan' import. I loved the music. It was different than anything that was on the radio at the time. I went on to purchase Cherie's solo album, her and her sister's album, Joan Jett's albums, and I even had The Orchid's album. Of course, I bought Lita Ford's albums and even got to meet her at an album signing. So, all that being said, on to the film.I didn't know anything about the groups origins but a lot of what was in the film wasn't suprising. An ""all girl"" group that was exploited to the max by their 'manager', Kim Fowley(who would have thought that? LOL). I thought it was entertaining and the acting was good, but, I think the Edgeplay documentary was more informative. The way they seemed to implode was no different than The Clash or the Sex Pistols. All in all, if this is the first you heard of them, you missed some great music. They certainly paved the way for others to follow. That whole time period from 1976 to around 1981 music was exciting. Now it's just gone back to being boring again. Thanks for all the great tunes guys! My all time favorite Runaways song is C'mon from the Live in Japan album, Lita's solo KICKS ASS!

1323994,A8EDTKSPOMRWK,B0034G4P6W,hyperbolium,"[23, 27]","Perhaps its simply ironic justice that a group so thoroughly abused by their managers, the press and each other would, in the ostensible retelling of their story, be so thoroughly abused by their filmmaker and two of their members. The most obvious clue to the on-going animosity between the band members is that bassist Jackie Fox is spitefully renamed in film as the fictional ""Robin."" This follows latter-day bassist Victory Tischler Blue being denied the use of original Runaways studio recordings for her documentaryEdgeplay: A Film About the Runaways. Add to that the near complete absence of dialog for guitarist Lita Ford and drummer Sandy West in this ""biopic,"" and you have a film that posits the Runaways as a springboard for Joan Jett's solo stardom. Even vocalist Cherie Currie, upon whose biography this script is ostensibly based, has her story short-changed in the telling.The screenplay, credited to first-time feature director Floria Sigismondi, is a mess. The motivations and timeline are muddled, and the band's story isn't given any context. Was the band famous or only infamous? What led up to Cherie quitting the band? What happened to Lita and Sandy after The Runaways (or, for that matter, during their time in the Runaways)? The action and plot points often feel made up, rather than based on actual people and events. Worse, the characters' unending moroseness suggests there wasn't a moment of joy in the Runaways' career, and it remains unclear why any of the girls stayed involved in the band. The pacing is tortoise-like and the film's modern style fails to capture the mood of the times. The dialog and direction often reduce the `70s rock milieu to trite shorthand and communicate little feel for the period. The fictionalFoxes, in which Currie was featured alongside Jodie Foster in 1980, is a better window into the hard partying hopelessness of late-70s Los Angeles.Were the script and direction the only weak link, the film's leads might still have been entertaining, but they're out of their depth. Kristen Stewart shows little conviction as the firebrand Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning is no better, showing little charisma, sex appeal or rebel spirit, and often looks scared of her role rather than scared within it as an acted emotion. The real-life Currie is compelling and authoritative in the DVD's making-of documentary, showing Fanning's characterization to be docile and lost in comparison. The film would have been better cast without movie stars, so as to allow the actual band members' characters to take center stage. Michael Shannon provides a bravura performance as Kim Fowley, but Sigismondi gives him only one note to play, and his character quickly dissolves into repetition. The script fails to provide any of the characters dramatic arcs - no one is transformed, and when Currie declares that she wants her life back, the viewer is left to wonder why she wants to return to a life that was portrayed as being terrible to begin with.The historical liberties and omissions are numerous, including the fictionalized introduction of Currie's infamous corset on the band's 1977 tour of Japan. Currie's been widely quoted as having purchased the item in Los Angeles and she can seen wearing it in a 1976 promotional video of ""Cherry Bomb."" More damaging to the film's credibility, the transformational sexual assault that Currie details in her autobiography is barely alluded to. Jackie Fox's departure is necessarily skipped, since the bassist was skipped altogether as a character in the film, and the film's end skips past the Runaways initial post-group activities, including Currie's solo album, her album (and hit single) with sister Marie, Joan Jett's trip to the UK, her work with Sex Pistols Paul Cook and Steve Jones, the recording of her 1980 eponymous debut, and Lita Ford's emergence as a metal guitar goddess. Instead, the film rushes to Jett's canonization as a solo superstar.The film's credit-roll bios of Currie, Jett and Fowley provides the final FU to the rest of the band, whose contributions and post-band lives were apparently insufficiently important to merit mention. One might excuse the mythologizing of the Runaways as the first all-girl rock band (discounting Goldie & The Gingerbreds, the Feminine Complex, Fanny, and numerous garage-rock bands cataloged onGirls With Guitars), but the notion that Joan Jett was the band's sole artiste serves only to propagate the petty jealousies that tore the group apart in the first place. Floria Sigismondi's deft work as a modern music video director fails to provide the eye needed to sympathetically capture the feel of the 1970s, and in doing so she fails to tell the Runaways story in a way that does the band justice.

But you would think that Joan Jett would not be pleased to have herself being portrayed as such a skank. But then we see that she is the executive producer of the movie, so apparently she was quite pleased with the final results. Besides, she doesn't give a damn about her bad reputation, right? Cherie Currie was also involved in the production of the movie, so she was fine with it all as well.Girls need to be able to do everything boys can, and that involves being in a band and playing rock music. It's just a shame that the girls who should have been the role models for all the girls in the country with that dream went the way of so many others in the industry: becoming drug addicts. Like I said, accuracy is great, but it seems so many movies today abandon good acting and storytelling in an attempt to see which movie can shock the audience more. Like, do we really need to SEE Joan using a guitar as a toilet? What actress with any sort of self-respect would even be willing to do that in front of a camera? Were the girls actually lesbians or did they just have nothing better to do than experiment and be all over each other while they were stoned? If so, I could do without those scenes. A bit of romance instead of animal lust would have been nice.The acting was great... if you consider the ability to build up the emotions necessary to scream obscenities at your fellow actors talent. The language was horrendous. The music was good; I'll give them that. They could all sing and play the instruments and performed the songs well.

Lita Ford, who I am a much bigger fan of and was part of my scene that destroyed punk because of better playing is hardly in the film. I was getting into Motley Crue as Joan started her solo Career. I didn't say hair metal had better songs but it definitely was more technical, musically! That was me in about 85. Metal was taking over. Now that punk is making a comeback and bands like the Donna's are out there this is a good time for this movie! However Lita's absence is felt throughout the movie, she wasn't involved and it shows! This is a movie about the industry tying to corrupt a very young girl, Cherri Currie as the front girl in an all girl Rock band.

I think its ok that they used Lita's name but the film isn't as good with her limited almost non-existent role! There is also not enough concert footage and it is about very young girls. It's a good lesson young girls though. The movie is based on Cherri Currie's book. I think I may buy the book because, other than the movie ""Foxes"", in witch she basically plays herself, I know very little about her. She disappeared from the industry in the mid 80's. The movie has Drugs, implied sex and lesbianism so parents beware. I think this story of legendary Rocker Joan Jett and young Starlet Cherri Currie is not bad.

1324000,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0034G4P6W,Jason,"[2, 4]","The major problem with this biographical movie - other than Stewart's anesthetized performance - is the continual attempt to shock the audience instead of simply telling the story of The Runaways' struggles on the way toward success.  Instead, it's mostly the sex and drugs, and Joan Jett's apparent attempt to scissor every other members of the band.  And by other members of the band, I'm only talking about Cherrie Currie, because apparently Lita Ford, Sandy West, and Jackie Fox (who did not want to be involved) were supplementary at best.  At least Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon's performance is mesmerizing in its psychosis and conceit) had some depth and personality to it, because other than that, the movie has minimal positive aspects.  Kristen Stewart's endless supply of cigarettes do what her performance couldn't, smolder.  Which is quite bad when considering the source material.  Dakota Fanning's realistic, albeit boring performance exudes the immaturity and minimal talent of Currie.The screenplay is far too inconsistent, has no consistently resonating theme, no real lessons learned and the beginning drags like a plow.  Not that there weren't attempts at story-telling.  In one failure Jett's difficulties of breaking into a male-dominated rock industry are displayed; we see Kristen Stewart molest a guitar and assault the ears of a music teacher (Dimone from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) with what appeared to be a grand mal seizure with a pick.  It wasn't about overcoming male restrictions.  It was about her sounding horrible at that time.  She needed practice.  Another sequence shows the girls on the road, sharing bedrooms at a motel I wouldn't frequent without first examining the sheets with a black light.  Later still, the band gets upset at Currie for a PG-13 photo spread.  While the challenges follow reality, they do nothing for the continuity purposes of a film.  Especially when lingering questions abound (i.e. barely a hiccup on why Currie quit).The promising aspects of the movie are the music and the design.  Bravo to the set and costume design, because it felt like I was in a grungy punk-club in the late 70s.  From the lighting to the clothing, all visual aspects were realistic and interesting.What I wanted was sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but if the drug is Lunesta the impact is minimized.",2,"Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll",1325635200,"01 4, 2012",2012,2342,"['major', 'problem', 'biographical', 'movie', 'other', 'Stewart', 'anesthetized', 'performance', 'continual', 'attempt', 'shock', 'audience', 'instead', 'simply', 'telling', 'story', 'Runaways', 'struggles', 'way', 'success', 'Instead', 'mostly', 'sex', 'drugs', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'apparent', 'attempt', 'scissor', 'other', 'members', 'band', 'other', 'members', 'band', ""'m"", 'only', 'talking', 'Cherrie', 'Currie', 'apparently', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'Sandy', 'West', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'be', 'involved', 'were', 'supplementary', 'best', 'least', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'performance', 'mesmerizing', 'psychosis', 'conceit', 'had', 'depth', 'personality', 'other', 'movie', 'minimal', 'positive', 'aspects', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'endless', 'supply', 'cigarettes', 'do', 'what', 'performance', 'could', ""n't"", 'smolder', 'Which', 'quite', 'bad', 'when', 'considering', 'source', 'material', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'realistic', 'boring', 'performance', 'immaturity', 'minimal', 'talent', 'Currie.The', 'screenplay', 'far', 'too', 'inconsistent', 'consistently', 'resonating', 'theme', 'real', 'lessons', 'learned', 'beginning', 'plow', 'Not', 'were', ""n't"", 'attempts', 'story-telling', 'one', 'failure', 'Jett', 'difficulties', 'breaking', 'male-dominated', 'rock', 'industry', 'are', 'displayed', 'see', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'molest', 'guitar', 'assault', 'ears', 'music', 'teacher', 'Dimone', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'what', 'appeared', 'be', 'grand', 'mal', 'seizure', 'pick', 'was', ""n't"", 'overcoming', 'male', 'restrictions', 'was', 'sounding', 'horrible', 'time', 'needed', 'practice', 'sequence', 'girls', 'road', 'sharing', 'bedrooms', 'motel', 'would', ""n't"", 'frequent', 'first', 'examining', 'sheets', 'black', 'light', 'Later', 'still', 'band', 'upset', 'Currie', 'PG-13', 'photo', 'spread', 'challenges', 'follow', 'reality', 'do', 'nothing', 'continuity', 'purposes', 'film', 'Especially', 'when', 'lingering', 'questions', 'abound', 'i.e', 'barely', 'hiccup', 'why', 'Currie', 'quit', 'promising', 'aspects', 'movie', 'are', 'music', 'design', 'Bravo', 'set', 'costume', 'design', 'felt', 'was', 'grungy', 'punk-club', 'late', '70s', 'lighting', 'clothing', 'visual', 'aspects', 'were', 'realistic', 'interesting.What', 'wanted', 'was', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'roll', 'drug', 'Lunesta', 'impact', 'minimized']",N/A

The bio-pics of the 60's era musician's either focus on the addictions or the music, but punk era bio-pics of the band seem to get both right. Not only does The Runaways manage to tell the story of the band, but also manages to translate the existential experience of the times and the music.The Runaways follows the myth of the band, The Runaways. Created by Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) a long time Sunset Strip dissipate/denizen with record producer cards in his pocket he meets the teenaged Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) who wanted to start an all girl band. Fowley accommodates her by her introducing her to drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) and they go prowling L.A. clubs to find a Bridget Bardot type to front the band and discover the 15 year old Cherie Curry (Dakota Fanning). Fowley soon has them in a an abandoned trailer to practice as he whips them into shape with his ""Rock `n' Roll boot camp.""  The irony in The Runaways was that the band was the creation of the band (like the Sex Pistols owing their existence to Malcom McLaren) both of whom understood the style over substance philosophy of self-promotion and controversy. When The Runaways started discovering themselves as artists they had to fight Fowley who treated them as a product and that he owned them, and they owed their success to him.As the band climbs to rock stardom, the movie captures at first the freedom and victory the first flash that success provides. But in the story of Runaways front woman Cherie Currie, who truly lived up to the band's name in trying to escape and avoid her father's alcohol problems, the sins of the father are visited upon the daughter and Currie finds herself wrapped up in drugs and alcohol. Much has been made about Fanning playing a role that is so ""adult,"" but she is the same age Currie was as she lived it. The Who sung of ""girls of 15 and sexually knowing"" life can add years of experience to a teenagers life and Rock 'n' Roll can accelerate that; you can see it on Fannings face towards the end of the movie washed up at 17 Currie could have been well on her way to making Jim Morrison's death seem that of an old man.Stewart and Fanning both disappear into their roles. Stewart seems to inhabit Joan Jett, she has the look down, she sounds like Jett, she even has the ""hunch"" over the microphone that Jett has when singing and playing. Michael Shannon is decadently creepy as Fowley. The other members of The Runaways are set in the background, Sandy West is there so The Runaways can form, and Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) when they need a little internal dissent in the band, but the movie is based on Cherie Currie's autobiogrpahy Neon Angel, and focuses on hers and Jett's story.I read some of the previous reviews of the movie and I found the movie much better than the reviews, it's a story that rocks!DVD Bonus Features: The Runaways DVD has a couple of nice bonus features. A commentary with Joan Jett, Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning. Some times the commentary sounds like three girls sitting in the row in front of you talking, but during key scenes of the movie Jett adds a few remembrances' or tidbits on how close to reality the scene is to make it worthwhile. There's also a nice little making of documentary ""Plugged In"" that talks with all the principals and key members of the crew.",4,"The Runaways Puts Sex, Drugs & Rock 'n' Roll Back In Rock Movies",1269216000,"03 22, 2010",2010,3435,"['movies', 'punk', 'rock', 'seem', 'get', 'experience', 'right', 'Sid', 'Nancy', 'Runaways', 'bio-pics', '60', 'era', 'musician', 'focus', 'addictions', 'music', 'punk', 'era', 'bio-pics', 'band', 'seem', 'get', 'right', 'Not', 'only', 'Runaways', 'manage', 'tell', 'story', 'band', 'also', 'translate', 'existential', 'experience', 'times', 'music.The', 'Runaways', 'myth', 'band', 'Runaways', 'Created', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'long', 'time', 'Sunset', 'Strip', 'dissipate/denizen', 'record', 'producer', 'cards', 'pocket', 'teenaged', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'wanted', 'start', 'girl', 'band', 'Fowley', 'introducing', 'drummer', 'Sandy', 'West', 'Stella', 'Maeve', 'go', 'prowling', 'L.A.', 'clubs', 'find', 'Bridget', 'Bardot', 'type', 'front', 'band', 'discover', '15', 'year', 'old', 'Cherie', 'Curry', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Fowley', 'soon', 'abandoned', 'trailer', 'practice', 'shape', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'boot', 'camp', 'irony', 'Runaways', 'was', 'band', 'was', 'creation', 'band', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'owing', 'existence', 'Malcom', 'McLaren', 'whom', 'understood', 'style', 'substance', 'philosophy', 'self-promotion', 'controversy', 'When', 'Runaways', 'started', 'discovering', 'artists', 'had', 'fight', 'Fowley', 'who', 'treated', 'product', 'owned', 'owed', 'success', 'him.As', 'band', 'rock', 'stardom', 'movie', 'captures', 'first', 'freedom', 'victory', 'first', 'flash', 'success', 'story', 'Runaways', 'front', 'woman', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'who', 'truly', 'lived', 'up', 'band', 'name', 'trying', 'escape', 'avoid', 'father', 'alcohol', 'problems', 'sins', 'father', 'are', 'visited', 'daughter', 'Currie', 'wrapped', 'up', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'Much', 'been', 'made', 'Fanning', 'playing', 'role', 'so', 'adult', 'same', 'age', 'Currie', 'was', 'lived', 'Who', 'sung', 'girls', '15', 'sexually', 'knowing', 'life', 'can', 'add', 'years', 'experience', 'teenagers', 'life', 'Rock', 'n', 'Roll', 'can', 'accelerate', 'can', 'see', 'Fannings', 'face', 'end', 'movie', 'washed', 'up', '17', 'Currie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'well', 'way', 'making', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'death', 'seem', 'old', 'man.Stewart', 'Fanning', 'disappear', 'roles', 'Stewart', 'inhabit', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'look', 'down', 'Jett', 'even', 'hunch', 'microphone', 'Jett', 'when', 'singing', 'playing', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'decadently', 'creepy', 'Fowley', 'other', 'members', 'Runaways', 'are', 'set', 'background', 'Sandy', 'West', 'there', 'so', 'Runaways', 'can', 'form', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'Scout', 'Taylor-Compton', 'when', 'need', 'little', 'internal', 'dissent', 'band', 'movie', 'based', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'autobiogrpahy', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'hers', 'Jett', 'story.I', 'read', 'previous', 'reviews', 'movie', 'found', 'movie', 'much', 'better', 'reviews', 'story', 'DVD', 'Bonus', 'Features', 'Runaways', 'DVD', 'couple', 'nice', 'bonus', 'features', 'commentary', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'times', 'commentary', 'sounds', 'three', 'girls', 'sitting', 'row', 'front', 'talking', 'key', 'scenes', 'movie', 'Jett', 'few', 'remembrances', 'tidbits', 'how', 'close', 'reality', 'scene', 'make', 'worthwhile', 'also', 'nice', 'little', 'making', 'documentary', 'Plugged', 'talks', 'principals', 'key', 'members', 'crew']",N/A

Brutally honest, THE RUNAWAYS transcends itself to become more than a rock 'n' roll movie---It is nothing less than a wistful expression of the truly heartfelt and passionate love shared between Jett and Currie, who allow the audience to look on.The girls were fifteen years old when they met; Jett was the dominant one and the better musician and composer, but Currie was the sex kitten who brought ""The Runaways"" playlist to life onstage.Madonna owes a great, unacknowledged, debt to Currie, and the other girl bands of the '80s openly acknowledge ""The Runaways'"" profound impact upon them (Michael Steele of ""The Bangles"" was a ""Runaway"" for awhile.)Sadly, Currie became overwhelmed by it all and retreated into drink and drugs. She abandoned ""The Runaways"" and ended her musical career, re-emerging years later as a Motivational Speaker and Counselor for teens. She now does chainsaw sculpture. Jett went on to found The Blackhearts and resumed topping the charts with ""I Love Rock 'N' Roll"" and other songs.I hope they healed their heartbreaking breach.

To make it happen, Jett seeks out and convinces slimy record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) that her idea for an all-girl rock band could make it big. When he introduces her to drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve), the band starts to take form. Fowley, looking for an image to front the band, discovers 15-year-old Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) at a club. Lead guitarist Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) and bass player Robin (Alia Shawkat) round out the band and The Runaways are formed in 1975.Touting The Runaways as jailbait rather than a tough all-girl band, Fowley signs them with Mercury Records. The relationship between Cherie and Joan begins to grow as does the band's popularity, but the pressure of rockstar life along with the drugs and alcohol begins to break Cherie. After collapsing, she is taken to the hospital and eventually quits the band altogether. Jett on the other hand, relishes and excels in the fame the band brings and eventually starts her own band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.Floria Sigismondi's film is based on `Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway', Cherie Currie's biography of her years with The Runaways. The film focuses mainly on the relationship between Cherie Currie and Joan Jett until Currie's departure from the band two years later.Kristen Stewart plays cool and sexy Jett in a very believable way, right down to the swagger.

1324017,A2MP7ZHX7O7FSX,B0034G4P6W,LFrog1386,"[5, 6]","The Runaways rocks. I knew little about the band going in because I grew up in the 80's and rocked out to Joan Jett only as a solo artist and from what I have read of the history since then, it isn't the most accurate portrayal. But that is for several reasons, all of which are valid: first, this is based on Cherie Currie's biography ""Neon Angel"". Second, several members of the band refused to participate and one even refused to allow their name to be used (in the case of Jackie Fox). So the film chose to focus mostly on Cherie, Joan and Sandy West, the drummer, for obvious reasons.To me, this film epitomizes what the 70's were all about-divorce was new and the nuclear family was disintegrating; kids were starting to raise themselves as mom went off into the work force for the first time ever. Drugs and alcohol broke apart more families and it showed in the restlessness and angst of the youth. Punk rock was youth in revolt and the idea of an all-girl rock band fit the era perfectly.To this end, Joan taught herself how to play guitar and approached Kim Fowley, a well known record producer, to tell him the world was ready for women in rock. With Fowley's help, Cherie was found to front the band and with the addition of Lita, Sandy and Jackie, The Runaways was forged.Once the girls hit the road, chaos ensued with no parental supervision. Drugs, sexual experimentation and abuse became a steady diet until Cherie's young body could not handle it anymore. Her exhaustion, coupled with the guilt of leaving her sister behind to care for their alcoholic father and her disgust with Kim Fowley's treatment of the girls, all collided and caused her to leave the band.The Runaways lasted another couple of years after Cherie left; something not  shown in the film. It is clear that Joan went on to become a rock-n-roll legend-one of the few women of rock that have been successful for several decades.I think this movie is a winner despite the fact that they weren't able to tell the whole story; Kristen Stewart really nailed Joan Jett's voice and body language-I forgot about this being Kristen and believed she was really Joan. Dakota Fanning as Cherie was perfect; she portrayed the sex kitten awkwardly because she was only 15 and still gangly and gawky. So was Cherie-it hammered it home how badly these girls were being exploited. Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley was spot-on as a somewhat abusive band manager. In fact, Shannon stole the show with his over-the-top theatrics.Interspersed between all the action is the music and it's a great soundtrack-mixed in with The Runaways hits were tunes by Suzy Quatro, the Sex Pistols, MC-5 and Joan Jett's later music as a solo artist. This film could have been a 5 out of 5 stars if more time was spent on Joan's and Sandy's backgrounds, which they could have covered, since I assume they had access and permission to use it. Sandy died of cancer in 2006 and it would have been nice to see the film dedicated to her, out of respect as one of the founding members of the band. Sandy may have passed on, but the rock-n-roll never dies.",4,Sex and Drugs and Rock-n-Roll,1277769600,"06 29, 2010",2010,3094,"['Runaways', 'rocks', 'knew', 'little', 'band', 'going', 'grew', 'up', '80', 'rocked', 'out', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'only', 'solo', 'artist', 'what', 'have', 'read', 'history', 'then', ""n't"", 'most', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'several', 'reasons', 'are', 'valid', 'first', 'based', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'biography', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'Second', 'several', 'members', 'band', 'refused', 'participate', 'one', 'even', 'refused', 'allow', 'name', 'be', 'used', 'case', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'film', 'chose', 'focus', 'mostly', 'Cherie', 'Joan', 'Sandy', 'West', 'drummer', 'obvious', 'reasons.To', 'film', 'what', '70', 'were', 'about-divorce', 'was', 'new', 'nuclear', 'family', 'was', 'disintegrating', 'kids', 'were', 'starting', 'raise', 'mom', 'went', 'off', 'work', 'force', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'Drugs', 'alcohol', 'broke', 'apart', 'more', 'families', 'showed', 'restlessness', 'angst', 'youth', 'Punk', 'rock', 'was', 'youth', 'revolt', 'idea', 'all-girl', 'rock', 'band', 'fit', 'era', 'perfectly.To', 'end', 'Joan', 'taught', 'how', 'play', 'guitar', 'approached', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'well', 'known', 'record', 'producer', 'tell', 'world', 'was', 'ready', 'women', 'rock', 'Fowley', 'help', 'Cherie', 'was', 'found', 'front', 'band', 'addition', 'Lita', 'Sandy', 'Jackie', 'Runaways', 'was', 'forged.Once', 'girls', 'hit', 'road', 'chaos', 'ensued', 'parental', 'supervision', 'Drugs', 'sexual', 'experimentation', 'abuse', 'became', 'steady', 'diet', 'Cherie', 'young', 'body', 'could', 'not', 'handle', 'anymore', 'exhaustion', 'coupled', 'guilt', 'leaving', 'sister', 'care', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'disgust', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'treatment', 'girls', 'collided', 'caused', 'leave', 'band.The', 'Runaways', 'lasted', 'couple', 'years', 'Cherie', 'left', 'something', 'not', 'shown', 'film', 'clear', 'Joan', 'went', 'become', 'rock-n-roll', 'legend-one', 'few', 'women', 'rock', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'several', 'decades.I', 'think', 'movie', 'winner', 'fact', 'were', ""n't"", 'able', 'tell', 'whole', 'story', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'really', 'nailed', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'voice', 'body', 'language-I', 'forgot', 'being', 'Kristen', 'believed', 'was', 'really', 'Joan', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Cherie', 'was', 'perfect', 'portrayed', 'sex', 'kitten', 'awkwardly', 'was', 'only', '15', 'still', 'gangly', 'gawky', 'So', 'was', 'Cherie-it', 'hammered', 'home', 'how', 'badly', 'girls', 'were', 'being', 'exploited', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'was', 'spot-on', 'somewhat', 'abusive', 'band', 'manager', 'fact', 'Shannon', 'stole', 'show', 'over-the-top', 'theatrics.Interspersed', 'action', 'music', 'great', 'soundtrack-mixed', 'Runaways', 'hits', 'were', 'tunes', 'Suzy', 'Quatro', 'Sex', 'Pistols', 'MC-5', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'later', 'music', 'solo', 'artist', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', '5', '5', 'stars', 'more', 'time', 'was', 'spent', 'Joan', 'Sandy', 'backgrounds', 'could', 'have', 'covered', 'assume', 'had', 'access', 'permission', 'use', 'Sandy', 'died', 'cancer', '2006', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'see', 'film', 'dedicated', 'respect', 'one', 'founding', 'members', 'band', 'Sandy', 'may', 'have', 'passed', 'rock-n-roll', 'never', 'dies']",N/A
1324018,A17O9AHKHK66AI,B0034G4P6W,L. Gildart,"[0, 0]","This film has some issues, it's true. It's based on Cherie Currie's book, and Joan Jett executive produced it, so the movie deals mostly with only two of the Runaways. In fact, Lita Ford is reduced to complaining about Cherie Currie receiving more than her fair share of attention. For me, this added a layer of irony to an otherwise shallow band biopic.The lack of depth really isn't a downside, at least not for me. The band wasn't all that deep. What made them great was timing, youth, novelty, and amazing energy. Punk was just hitting its stride in 1975, and the Runaways were perfectly positioned. But they somehow ended up making songs - at least some songs - that hold up really well. The movie illustrates, very deftly, how this was partly by accident, partly by the sheer force of Joan Jett's will, and partly by Kim Fowley's perverted design.To that end, maybe by accident, maybe by design, who knows? the movie makes fantastic use of stunt casting in the small roles. Marie Currie, Cherie's twin who joined her in later musical endeavors, is played by Elvis' granddaughter Riley Keough. Robert Romanus, the smarmy Mike Damone from Fast Times at Ridgemont High, plays the smarmy guitar teacher who disses Joan Jett and tries to make her play On Top of Old Smoky.Cherie Currie's mother, actress Marie Harmon, is played to perfection by mother of the year Tatum O'Neal (who looks amazing, by the way). And, in the biggest and best bit of stunt casting, Kristen Stewart, who in real life strongly resembles Cherie, absolutely disappears into the role of Joan Jett. The overall effect of this is to communicate the similarities between Jett and Curry without adding a word of dialogue. Dakota Fanning, although physically softer-looking than Currie, is used well to convey how very young Currie really was during her time as a Runaway.I didn't walk away with any deep lasting impressions after watching this - except that Courtney Love should be sending Cherie Currie royalty checks, but it is a movie I would watch more than once on dvd. The soundtrack is a nice mix of real Joan Jett and surprisingly good performances from Fanning and Stewart, together with some glam classics.",4,Worth seeing just for the stunt casting!,1271203200,"04 14, 2010",2010,2187,"['film', 'issues', 'true', 'based', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'book', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'executive', 'produced', 'movie', 'deals', 'mostly', 'only', 'two', 'Runaways', 'fact', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'reduced', 'complaining', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'receiving', 'more', 'fair', 'share', 'attention', 'added', 'layer', 'irony', 'otherwise', 'shallow', 'band', 'biopic.The', 'lack', 'depth', 'really', ""n't"", 'downside', 'least', 'not', 'band', 'was', ""n't"", 'deep', 'What', 'made', 'great', 'was', 'timing', 'youth', 'novelty', 'amazing', 'energy', 'Punk', 'was', 'just', 'hitting', 'stride', '1975', 'Runaways', 'were', 'perfectly', 'positioned', 'somehow', 'ended', 'up', 'making', 'songs', 'least', 'songs', 'hold', 'up', 'really', 'well', 'movie', 'very', 'deftly', 'how', 'was', 'partly', 'accident', 'partly', 'sheer', 'force', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'will', 'partly', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'perverted', 'design.To', 'end', 'maybe', 'accident', 'maybe', 'design', 'who', 'movie', 'fantastic', 'use', 'stunt', 'casting', 'small', 'roles', 'Marie', 'Currie', 'Cherie', 'twin', 'who', 'joined', 'later', 'musical', 'endeavors', 'played', 'Elvis', 'granddaughter', 'Riley', 'Keough', 'Robert', 'Romanus', 'smarmy', 'Mike', 'Damone', 'Fast', 'Times', 'Ridgemont', 'High', 'smarmy', 'guitar', 'teacher', 'who', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'tries', 'make', 'play', 'Top', 'Old', 'Smoky.Cherie', 'Currie', 'mother', 'actress', 'Marie', 'Harmon', 'played', 'perfection', 'mother', 'year', 'Tatum', ""O'Neal"", 'who', 'amazing', 'way', 'biggest', 'best', 'bit', 'stunt', 'casting', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'who', 'real', 'life', 'strongly', 'Cherie', 'absolutely', 'role', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'overall', 'effect', 'communicate', 'similarities', 'Jett', 'Curry', 'adding', 'word', 'dialogue', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'physically', 'softer-looking', 'Currie', 'used', 'well', 'convey', 'how', 'very', 'young', 'Currie', 'really', 'was', 'time', 'Runaway.I', 'did', ""n't"", 'walk', 'away', 'deep', 'lasting', 'impressions', 'watching', 'Courtney', 'Love', 'should', 'be', 'sending', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'royalty', 'checks', 'movie', 'would', 'watch', 'more', 'once', 'dvd', 'soundtrack', 'nice', 'mix', 'real', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'surprisingly', 'good', 'performances', 'Fanning', 'Stewart', 'together', 'glam', 'classics']",N/A

There is a scene where Cherie, the lead singer, is at a store all loaded up on stuff, trying to buy vodka. The promise of so much can get used up and lost especially when we are young. The storyline is about the sixteen year old girls coming together to make a hard rocking band, with much of the music developed by Jett and Fowley. Fowley is a character who is into hisself and his idea and image of what rock is. He is the manager of the band and controls the young girls, who look at him as an authority figure. Cherie's family is pretty much nonexistant, except for a sister who begins to emulate Cherie once she becomes known in the music industry. The big sister who had the pretty long blond hair, cuts and dyes it to look like her singer/songwriter sibling wearing huge amounts of eye makeup that doesn't fit her features. It was a great score of music to listen to and it was fun to learn about the band and how they made it to full on concerts. The things I liked, I liked the songs, I would like to sing songs that were full of intensity and emotions. I liked the way they wore clothes and makeup. I liked the sushi place where they had plates and plates of sushi. Assortment galore. Japanese wine and noodles with music sung by geisha girls. The color and the band rocking was fun and lifted my spirits. They did a pile of drugs and I can't explain it but I didn't feel as bad. The absent parents and her too much freedom was sad but freedom felt good to watch, freedom to do whatever you want. The gigs and the interviews all seemed like a world that spelled excess. Cherie just has to bow out cus it was to much for her while the other girls kept kicking. Joan Jett and Lita Ford came out of the Runaways.

True, theyy were ann all-girl band in an era of male rockers. However musically they were not that great which does not really transpire here. Yes, they were a great garage band in the pre-punk era, but the fact that Kim Fowley did manipulate them p[retty hard at times did not serve their reputation well.

1324024,A266V5A29PB10U,B0034G4P6W,Mark Keith,"[4, 7]","I've liked Joan Jett for a long time, at least since first seeing Paul Schrader's ""Light Of Day"" in the mid 1980s: a movie that I really liked, and where she, like Bjork after her, had the good sense not to focus on a movie career afterwards. But I've never been a super huge fan of her music, so my love of the movie ...""The Runaways"" is not colored by any misplaced Joan Jett worship. It may be a little early for me to call ""The Runaways"" my favorite film of 2010, particularly since we are only  into 2010 and the only other movie I've seen that was released in 2010 is ""Chloe""(a disappointing film for anyone who likes the work of Atom Egoyen). But I'll wager that it'll be in my top 5. Floria Sigismondi directed mostly music videos before directing ""The Runaways"", which has some obvious parallels to Anton Corbijn's (a photographer of rock musicians) film on Ian Curtis and Joy Division: ""Control"". Both films are about incidents that took place about the same time (the mid 1970s) and both have a main character practically obsessed with David Bowie's ""Aladdin Sane"" album. But ""Control"" is more controlled, the black and white images picture perfect compositions. ""The Runaways"" is in dingy color (though in our post Technicolor age, where the illusion of reality is king, most dramatic films are in dingy color) and more chaotic in composition: spaces are often claustrophobic and uncomfortable for most of the movie, action often occurs outside of the frame. After the band has broken up we are shown a calm and composed shot of Kirsten Stewart as Joan Jet, lying in the bathtub, revealing only her head and arms, a visual metaphor of the dismembering and the spot in the film where she begins, somewhat, to take control of her rock and roll career (which became, mostly, covering other people's songs). Michael Shannon, a character actor who has been good in all the roles I've seen him in, is great as Kim Fowley, the anarchic music producer that takes the band of teenage girls under his wings. If his performance is not forgotten by the end of the year, I'll bet (without the exchange of any real money) he might be nominated for some of those big awards - those awards always get the actors and actresses correct a lot more often than the best picture and director, even in the nominations. Kirsten Stewart's Joan Jett is understated, in a good way. And this film is for Dakota Fanning, as the lead singer Cherie Currie, what ""Buffalo 66"" was for Christina Ricci: her first great role in the first great film of her adult career.",5,"Don't know the true history, don't really care . . . love the movie",1270252800,"04 3, 2010",2010,2546,"[""'ve"", 'liked', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'long', 'time', 'least', 'first', 'seeing', 'Paul', 'Schrader', 'Light', 'Day', 'mid', '1980s', 'movie', 'really', 'liked', 'where', 'Bjork', 'had', 'good', 'sense', 'not', 'focus', 'movie', 'career', 'afterwards', ""'ve"", 'never', 'been', 'super', 'huge', 'fan', 'music', 'love', 'movie', 'Runaways', 'not', 'colored', 'misplaced', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'worship', 'may', 'be', 'little', 'early', 'call', 'Runaways', 'favorite', 'film', '2010', 'particularly', 'are', 'only', '2010', 'only', 'other', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'was', 'released', '2010', 'Chloe', 'disappointing', 'film', 'anyone', 'who', 'work', 'Atom', 'Egoyen', ""'ll"", 'wager', ""'ll"", 'be', 'top', '5', 'Floria', 'Sigismondi', 'directed', 'mostly', 'music', 'videos', 'directing', 'Runaways', 'obvious', 'parallels', 'Anton', 'Corbijn', 'photographer', 'rock', 'musicians', 'film', 'Ian', 'Curtis', 'Joy', 'Division', 'Control', 'films', 'are', 'incidents', 'took', 'place', 'same', 'time', 'mid', '1970s', 'have', 'main', 'character', 'practically', 'obsessed', 'David', 'Bowie', 'Aladdin', 'Sane', 'album', 'Control', 'more', 'controlled', 'black', 'white', 'images', 'picture', 'perfect', 'compositions', 'Runaways', 'dingy', 'color', 'post', 'Technicolor', 'age', 'where', 'illusion', 'reality', 'king', 'most', 'dramatic', 'films', 'are', 'dingy', 'color', 'more', 'chaotic', 'composition', 'spaces', 'are', 'often', 'claustrophobic', 'uncomfortable', 'most', 'movie', 'action', 'often', 'frame', 'band', 'broken', 'up', 'are', 'shown', 'calm', 'composed', 'shot', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'Joan', 'Jet', 'lying', 'bathtub', 'revealing', 'only', 'head', 'arms', 'visual', 'metaphor', 'dismembering', 'spot', 'film', 'where', 'somewhat', 'take', 'control', 'rock', 'roll', 'career', 'became', 'mostly', 'covering', 'other', 'people', 'songs', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'character', 'actor', 'who', 'been', 'good', 'roles', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'great', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'anarchic', 'music', 'producer', 'band', 'teenage', 'girls', 'wings', 'performance', 'not', 'forgotten', 'end', 'year', ""'ll"", 'bet', 'exchange', 'real', 'money', 'might', 'be', 'nominated', 'big', 'awards', 'awards', 'always', 'get', 'actors', 'actresses', 'correct', 'lot', 'more', 'often', 'best', 'picture', 'director', 'even', 'nominations', 'Kirsten', 'Stewart', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'understated', 'good', 'way', 'film', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'lead', 'singer', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'what', 'Buffalo', '66', 'was', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'first', 'great', 'role', 'first', 'great', 'film', 'adult', 'career']",N/A

They were in reality teen girls who took on the male orientated rock industry and merged punk and metal in some great songs. Unfortunately this movie doesn't tell the story in a more complete way. Lita ford is sidelined, the late drummer (rip) sandy west is also sidelined, and the main story of the band is lost behind the coming of age story of joan jett and cherie currie, both of whom were lucky to get off dope and have decent lives later on, lita ford and joan jett did quite well in the later years following this, cherie currie had a successful acting career for a while but lost it due to her partying sadly.The movie looks great on blu ray though, and this is worth owning if you love rock and roll and I was impressed with kirsten scotts performance , I don't agree at all with the downsayers of the acting in this movie, they did a great job, only the movie sorta bounces around and it's hard to get a feel for the direction it's going. It's a decent movie about a great band, one that deserves to be heard by more people today. The really made some great songs and if they had not gotten lost they would have lasted longer.

The Runaways were formed by Joan Jett and drummer Sandy West in 1975, but the film's focus is guided by Cherie Curry's memoirs ""Neon Angel"", on which the film is based, so the other three band members are in the background. It follows The Runaways from their formation until Curry left the band in 1977, so about two years. Director Floria Sigismondi, who also wrote the film, is a music video director. This is her first feature film. Joan Jett executive-produced, and Curry contributed her memoirs. Both women were very involved in the project.Mercifully, Sigismondi did not cast a bunch of twenty-somethings to play the teenagers. Dakota Fanning was 15, the age at which Cherie Curry joined The Runaways. And Kirsten Stewart was in her late teens, so not too far off. I was never convinced that Kristen Stewart could play the guitar, but Fanning is a revelation. She could front a punk band. Among the cast, she steals the film. But ""The Runaways"" ability to capture the spirit of these young people and the music they made is its most memorable quality. Great 1970s period costumes and production design are combined with trippy lighting and gritty, close quarters photography. Every scene is not literally true, but the style does well to capture the mood of youth making themselves heard in a particular time and place. And Michael Shannon is great as America's answer to Malcolm McLaren: hilarious, cynical, visionary.The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features are a making-of featurette, an audio commentary, and a publicity spot for the film (2 min). ""Plugged In: Making the Film"" (15 min) interviews director Floria Sigismondi, producers, the principle cast, and Cherie Curry about the real story behind the film and about making the movie. The audio commentary is by Joan Jett, Kristen Stewart, and Dakota Fanning. This is worth listening to if you want more of the real story. Joan Jett comments when the film departs from reality.

Going into this movie, all I knew were the songs ""Cherry Bomb"" and ""I love rock & roll"" - nothing about the band, members, their story, other music, etc..And I really enjoyed it. I thought it started off a bit weak - after about 10 minutes I was thinking about turning it off and popping something else in - but after that it was very enjoyable (and I'm sure going back and re-watching the beginning I would have a different opinion on it). I thought it was very interesting - I can't say how accurate it was though. One thing I did notice throughout was that the movie basically follows Joan and Cherie - some of the band is in the movie maybe a few minutes tops, and just sitting in the background. I don't know if they just didn't have an interesting story, but it was a bit odd that it only followed 2 of the members and just ignored everyone else.Video quality on the blu-ray was good - despite having a lot of grain and a ""retro look"", the blu-ray actually is worth the upgrade over the DVD. Lots of clarity/sharpness, great color, etc.. about a 4/5.Audio was great - nice and loud, it'll give your home theater a workout! 4.5 / 5.Extras, I can't comment on.

Nevertheless, drugs, casual sex, profanity, and anxious and stressful daily affairs made life hellish for those three desperate girls.With desperation for security, uncertain future, the three girls must follow their master, no matter how weird or abusive he was.  And, the impresario did know his clienteles and must cater to those by bending the minds and acts of his three unripe employees. They must learn how to cope with the belligerent and impulsive clients, express their bodily and verbal languages in a manner that could bring revenues.On their peak success, when their fans sought glimpses of those esoteric stars, the three girls were homeless, drugged out, and deprived from any self confidence.  The youngest of the three, who was forced to such unexpected lifestyle, never lost her longing to her family, straight life, and being home with her sister and sick father.  An episode of grief on her father's terminal illness, lent her enough strength to bail out of the underworld of absurdities:  Homeless, impoverished, yet happy and accomplished.The dichotomies of being superstar with millions of fans seeking their autographs contrasted of being impoverished and desperate for the least of family security and love; of having an alcoholic father dying from his addiction and losing his family and his two daughters to uncertain future, contrasted by his daughters indulgence in the same lifestyle of drugs, smoking, and alcohol; were all balanced by an innate sense by the youngest girl to get her life together; the grandmother's genuine impulse to protect her granddaughter from the cameras of intruders; and the sister who supported her sibling from the beginning to the end.  Despite having two short comments on the weirdness of the impresario by the girls and one of their mothers, that was reasonable enough to put things in prospective while watching the distressing fate of three helpless young women.In contrast to the movie The Doors, The Runaways ended with few happy endings.  Two of the three-girl band seemed to gave outgrown their confused adolescence, despite having mental scars and desire to forget the past.  Finally, taking the movie out of its time frame of the 1970's or its national origin, the movie narrates a familiar and old scenario that took, and still takes, place in many cultures and over many centuries.  Entertainment, magic, future-telling, and prostitution are the oldest industries that catch up the falling and unripe fruits from the trees of social deprivation, poverty, impoverishment, and despair.",5,"Adrift to fame and homelessness, with sweater endings of regaining sanity.",1269561600,"03 26, 2010",2010,3166,"['RunawaysThe', 'tough', 'choices', 'facing', 'movie', 'maker', 'were', 'balanced', 'reasonably', 'genuine', 'human', 'desire', 'do', 'good', 'three', 'teenage', 'girls', 'broken', 'homes', 'have', 'easy', 'way', 'fend', 'education', 'inherited', 'wealth', 'connections', 'absence', 'developing', 'image', 'self-competence', 'must', 'lean', 'impresario', 'who', 'help', 'develop', 'image', 'entertainment', 'sex', 'industry', 'credentials', 'get', 'talent', 'girls', 'could', 'ward', 'off', 'abuse', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'bail', 'such', 'underworld', 'absurdities', 'time', 'get', 'lives', 'together', 'Nevertheless', 'drugs', 'casual', 'sex', 'profanity', 'anxious', 'stressful', 'daily', 'affairs', 'made', 'life', 'hellish', 'three', 'desperate', 'girls.With', 'desperation', 'security', 'uncertain', 'future', 'three', 'girls', 'must', 'follow', 'master', 'matter', 'how', 'weird', 'abusive', 'was', 'impresario', 'did', 'know', 'clienteles', 'must', 'cater', 'bending', 'minds', 'acts', 'three', 'unripe', 'employees', 'must', 'learn', 'how', 'cope', 'belligerent', 'impulsive', 'clients', 'express', 'bodily', 'verbal', 'languages', 'manner', 'could', 'bring', 'revenues.On', 'peak', 'success', 'when', 'fans', 'sought', 'glimpses', 'esoteric', 'stars', 'three', 'girls', 'were', 'homeless', 'drugged', 'out', 'deprived', 'self', 'confidence', 'youngest', 'three', 'who', 'was', 'forced', 'such', 'unexpected', 'lifestyle', 'never', 'lost', 'longing', 'family', 'straight', 'life', 'being', 'home', 'sister', 'sick', 'father', 'episode', 'grief', 'father', 'terminal', 'illness', 'lent', 'enough', 'strength', 'bail', 'underworld', 'absurdities', 'Homeless', 'impoverished', 'happy', 'accomplished.The', 'dichotomies', 'being', 'superstar', 'millions', 'fans', 'seeking', 'autographs', 'contrasted', 'being', 'impoverished', 'desperate', 'least', 'family', 'security', 'love', 'having', 'alcoholic', 'father', 'dying', 'addiction', 'losing', 'family', 'two', 'daughters', 'uncertain', 'future', 'contrasted', 'daughters', 'indulgence', 'same', 'lifestyle', 'drugs', 'smoking', 'alcohol', 'were', 'balanced', 'innate', 'sense', 'youngest', 'girl', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'grandmother', 'genuine', 'impulse', 'protect', 'granddaughter', 'cameras', 'intruders', 'sister', 'who', 'supported', 'sibling', 'beginning', 'end', 'having', 'two', 'short', 'comments', 'weirdness', 'impresario', 'girls', 'one', 'mothers', 'was', 'reasonable', 'enough', 'put', 'things', 'prospective', 'watching', 'distressing', 'fate', 'three', 'helpless', 'young', 'women.In', 'contrast', 'movie', 'Doors', 'Runaways', 'ended', 'few', 'happy', 'endings', 'Two', 'three-girl', 'band', 'seemed', 'gave', 'outgrown', 'confused', 'adolescence', 'having', 'mental', 'scars', 'desire', 'forget', 'past', 'Finally', 'taking', 'movie', 'time', 'frame', '1970', 'national', 'origin', 'movie', 'familiar', 'old', 'scenario', 'took', 'still', 'place', 'many', 'cultures', 'over', 'many', 'centuries', 'Entertainment', 'magic', 'future-telling', 'prostitution', 'are', 'oldest', 'industries', 'catch', 'up', 'falling', 'unripe', 'fruits', 'trees', 'social', 'deprivation', 'poverty', 'impoverishment', 'despair']",N/A

I was surprised to see that it just made a little over 3 million dollars during it's brief theatrical run, even though most critic reviews were favorable. I didn't know much about the all girl band formed in 1975, but just by being a fan of rock music, I knew the names of Joan Jett and Lita Ford. This movie focuses more on Joan Jett and Cherie Currie, so arguably the most talented band member, Lita Ford, doesn't get much to say or do.I didn't think Kristen Stewart had it in her, especially after those terrible Twilight movies, but she pulls off the Joan Jett attitude and mannerisms about as good as one could hope for. Now I can't see any other actress in the part. Dakota Fanning, as Cherie Currie, is quite possibly the standout. She really shows some serious grown-up level acting here. Both actresses are in some pretty risqu&eacute; scenes, but because Dakota Fanning was only 15 at the time of filming, I think the majority of viewers will get a feeling that the writer/director must be perverted, until the end credits roll and you realize that a woman is responsible. Michael Shannon gets the third most screen time and manages to play one creepy manager. It's hard not to feel uncomfortable whenever he is on screen, but that's the point, and he nailed it.Not only do Kristen and Dakota act the part, they also do all the singing. The songs here are not the most techincal, but they are fun and full of middle finger waving angst.The Runaways isn't a great movie, but the three great acting performances, mid 70's backdrop, sex, drugs, and some rockin' tunes, keep it far away from ever feeling dull. For those like myself, who wouldn't be born until sometime in the next decade, this film gives a realistic look back in time when rock 'n' roll ruled the world.The Blu-ray looked and sounded much better than a regular DVD, but I've seen better.

1324032,A29XWXJ525HH7O,B0034G4P6W,MyD -- The Viewpoint,"[3, 4]","Cherrie Currie, Joan Jett and Lita Ford! This is a terrific rock biopic into the landmark girl punk band The Runaways.If you love the music of this era, you won't be disappointed by the movie! I love Joan Jett and Lita Ford but never knew that much about their beginnings. I don't know how accurate the movie is so I can't comment on that. However, Fanning as Cherrie shows she is doing a tremendous job making the difficult transition from child star to adult actor with amazing adeptness. I think she proves that she was never really so much a child actor as simply a true actor all along. I hope she continues to avoid the pitfalls. Fanning comes close to ""channeling"" Cherrie Currie and performs the vocals herself. Kristen Stewart only has to play her normal teen angst ridden, halting, ""what me!"" persona to get the job done and she does it well. If you go back and look at the early photos, Kristen is a pretty gook match for Joan Jett though I don't know about the personality. As for Lita Ford, I think they missed the boat by not delving into her role a little more. In fact, the whole move could have used just a few more minutes of depth into these girls lives.The soundtrack to this movie is terrific and very nostalgic. I thought the story was gripping, even if it wasn't meant to be particularly uplifting. It was inspiring to see the girls historic success. I also didn't think the story glamorized... or moralized against the rock and roll life style. It simply presented the story for others to view and take what they want from it. I don't know if I would call the movie epic like ""The Doors"" but the performances and music make this one a possible buy for me.

1324034,AJKWF4W7QD4NS,B0034G4P6W,"N. Durham ""Big Evil""","[7, 7]","The Runaways, based on Cherie Currie's autobiography, is a sadly flimsy account of the historic all-teenage girl band, their brushes with fame, and their eventual disintegration.  Dakota Fanning stars as vocalist Currie, whose recruited into the band along with guitarist Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) by record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon), who sees the marketing potential in this group.  After managing to achieve some fame in Japan, we bear witness to the drug, booze, and sex-filled odyssey that they partake in, with Currie in particular going on a downward spiral.  Any fans of The Runaways will quickly note the historical inaccuracies of the film, most notably due to various legal reasons and disputes with Jett, who serves as the film's co-producer.  Drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) is only glossed over, while Lita Ford (Rob Zombie's Halloween's Scout Taylor-Compton) barely makes an impact, and Jackie Fox is replaced by ""Robin"" (Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat).  That in itself is a bit annoying, but the film itself is more over the top than one may expect.  Still, Fanning and Stewart are surprisingly great in the lead roles, with Stewart in particular looking, moving, and even playing like the legendary rocker herself.  Michael Shannon is having such a blast as Fowley that you love to hate him, and he steals every scene that he's in.

1324037,AQBHNE9AP6YBP,B0034G4P6W,NostalgiaVHS,"[0, 0]","This film had the potential to be great: a coming of age tale about a beautiful young girl who is suddenly drafted into the American dream only to be chewed up and spit out before getting her feet off the ground. Familiar story, yes, but a powerful one which would have worked well against a rock n' roll backdrop. The story exists somewhere in the mess which is The Runaways, buried beneath a sea of corny dialogue and inane subplots. This film is one huge distraction from its mediocre screenplay. There are music montages, concert performances and random musical breaks littering the screen from the very beginning and it becomes exhausting quickly, especially considering how dreadful the actual music is. Somebody should have told writer/director Floria Sigismondi that she was making a MOVIE, not a music video.Here's the skeleton of the plot: Cherri Currie (Dakota Fanning) is a young girl living in Los Angeles who is constantly surrounded by sex and alcohol. She has seen these vices take a great toll on her family and friends, especially her father, who is an alcoholic dead-beat. At the same time, young rebel Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) wanders the city streets with a dream of becoming a rock star. The ambitious Jett convinces scummy music producer Kim Fowley to help her start her own group. Fowley, who recognizes this as an opportunity to exploit fresh young talent, embraces Jett and forms a band around her, a band which is completed by the addition of Cherri as the singer. Good girl Cherri is initially taken aback by the raunchy lyrics she's asked to sing, but after a while Fowley and the other band members peer pressure her into singing them. Soon enough, Cherri becomes so consumed with the debauchery and decadence of rock star life that she abandons her morals completely and becomes a helpless victim of sex and drug abuse.As I mentioned before, the music video style of this film is distracting and annoying at times, but the one critical error which manages to drag it down considerably is its confusion as to where to focus its story. The writers must have been torn as to what direction to take their film: whether it should be a rock n' roll bio-pic focusing on the Runaways as a band, or a coming-of-age saga focusing solely on the singer Cheri Currie (whose auto-biography the screenplay is based on). Instead of coming to an actual creative decision, the writers went down both roads, focusing on both Cherri Currie and, to a lesser extent, Joan Jett at the same time.Bad move. The sequences focusing on Jett seem peripheral and detrimental to the flow of the film, whereas the scenes featuring Cherri Currie seem to shine with greater depth and accuracy. Gee, I wonder why? Could it be because her story was based on another source (her auto-biography)? Yes, I would wager so. Eventually (and thankfully), the film abandons whatever Joan Jett story arc the writers were trying to establish to focus solely on Cherri Currie ( maybe because they ran out of ideas). Obviously, the film would have benefitted if its focus was exclusive to Currie from the beginning, but they just had to shove in an inane Joan Jett story (""Girls can't play guitar!"" ""Oh yeah, I'll show you!"") in order to appeal to a wider audience.The decision to cast Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart as the leads inspired some undeserved controversy when it was announced, but they gave some good performances despite the confused screenplay. It seemed like they were using this film solely for the purpose of shedding their `good girl' images, but after seeing the actual film I was impressed by their work. They prepared for their roles by rehearsing Runaway songs for a whole month, which is funny because they probably practiced more than the original band.Overall, the film suffers greatly from a weak screenplay, a lack of clarity, and an ill-fitting tone.

The other reviews seem to agree with this and give you details of the movie.  What they don't mention is the following reasons why I would give this movie 4 1/2 stars rather than 5.1) Joan Jett starts playing the Gibson Melody Maker in 1977 not at the time she is leaving the Runaways at the start of 1979 or her 1981 period in Europe.2) The tension with Lita Ford and the portrail of Lita Ford are too downplayed.3) Other than Jackie Fox the movie doesn't address the chaos over the bass players in the Runaways.  Since the producers chose to include time periods outside the formal Cherie Currie time frame, I believe this would have helped.4) They never mention the name of the club in the valley, ""The Sugar Shack"" where Joan Jett and Kim Fowley asked Cherie Currie to audition; although it is in the book.5) I don't believe they give an explanation of the Jackie Fox, broken bass, that led to her departure.  She left the band during the Japan tour, so they could have gotten this correct.  Credit I believe was lacking that Joan Jett stepped up and played Bass for the remainder of the Japanese Tour.6) It is curious to me that the movie seems to downplay the offers and work that Cherie Currie got after she left the Runaways including her touring with her sister Marie.7) I beleve that the part of Marie Currie was understated in comparison to the book.Speaking as a Jetthead, I want to thank Joan Jett for her imput into this movie along with her forward to the book, ""Neon Angel"".  I also want to thank Cherie Currie for her contributions as an advisor to this movie and her courage for giving us the book which the movie is based on.Overall the movie is excellent and brings ""Neon Angel"" to a near perfect representation of a band which paid far too much to change the music industry.  I highly recommend the film and encourage you to also watch ""Edge Play"" which is an amazing documentary of the band members, Kim Fowler and others associated with the Runaways.  The quality of acting is brought more into focus if you take the time to watch ""Edge Play"" first and then ""The Runaways"" movie. From watching both of these films and doing some research you will get a fuller understanding of what led up to, was and grew out of the Runaways along with the era in which they existed and changed.",5,Brilliantly Acted Movie,1296777600,"02 4, 2011",2011,2428,"['Kristen', 'Stewart', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'Michael', 'Shannon', 'bring', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'book', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'life', 'brilliant', 'acting', 'other', 'reviews', 'seem', 'agree', 'give', 'details', 'movie', 'What', 'do', ""n't"", 'mention', 'following', 'reasons', 'why', 'would', 'give', 'movie', '4', '1/2', 'stars', 'rather', '5.1', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'playing', 'Gibson', 'Melody', 'Maker', '1977', 'not', 'time', 'leaving', 'Runaways', 'start', '1979', '1981', 'period', 'Europe.2', 'tension', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'portrail', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'are', 'too', 'downplayed.3', 'Other', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'movie', ""n't"", 'address', 'chaos', 'bass', 'players', 'Runaways', 'producers', 'chose', 'include', 'time', 'periods', 'formal', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'time', 'frame', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'helped.4', 'never', 'mention', 'name', 'club', 'valley', 'Sugar', 'Shack', 'where', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'asked', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'audition', 'book.5', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'give', 'explanation', 'Jackie', 'Fox', 'broken', 'bass', 'led', 'departure', 'left', 'band', 'Japan', 'tour', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'correct', 'Credit', 'believe', 'was', 'lacking', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'stepped', 'up', 'played', 'Bass', 'remainder', 'Japanese', 'Tour.6', 'curious', 'movie', 'downplay', 'offers', 'work', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'got', 'left', 'Runaways', 'including', 'touring', 'sister', 'Marie.7', 'beleve', 'part', 'Marie', 'Currie', 'was', 'understated', 'comparison', 'book.Speaking', 'Jetthead', 'want', 'thank', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'imput', 'movie', 'forward', 'book', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'also', 'want', 'thank', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'contributions', 'advisor', 'movie', 'courage', 'giving', 'book', 'movie', 'based', 'movie', 'excellent', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'near', 'perfect', 'representation', 'band', 'paid', 'far', 'too', 'much', 'change', 'music', 'industry', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'encourage', 'also', 'watch', 'Edge', 'Play', 'amazing', 'documentary', 'band', 'members', 'Kim', 'Fowler', 'others', 'associated', 'Runaways', 'quality', 'acting', 'brought', 'more', 'focus', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'Edge', 'Play', 'first', 'then', 'Runaways', 'movie', 'watching', 'films', 'doing', 'research', 'will', 'get', 'fuller', 'understanding', 'what', 'led', 'up', 'was', 'grew', 'Runaways', 'era', 'existed', 'changed']",N/A

There are really two distinct audiences for this film.1) 40 year-old+ fans of The Runaways2) 15 year-old fans of the two tween heartthrob actresses who star in itI am decidedly a creaky member of the former who, one would think, not unreasonably expected a movie about The Runaways. Of course, as you may have already heard, this is not a film about The Runaways. It is a film about Joan Jett and Cherie Currie and three other girls who on about 7 occasions seem to wander into the frame, and a drummer who actually has a few lines of dialogue.This Joan Jett vanity project is based on Cherie Currie's autobiography ""Neon Angel"". An approximately 130 page badly written curio published years ago by a tiny, indie publisher. The book focuses, of course on Cherie Currie, but then again it should...it's an autobiography. As a basis for the ostensible tale of 5 young girls called The Runaways however, it's not a good idea.The movie was exec produced by Joan Jett and her lifelong svengali Kenny Laguna, and it won't take much for you to figure this out. The fact that the rest of the band are treated, quite literally as if they never existed tells you pretty much all you needed to know. Exactly why a talented, beloved musician like Joan Jett would produce an ego trip so mind-bogglingly petty as this thing is a mystery to me, but it certainly doesn't speak well of her magnanimity.The two, young leads who play Joan and Cherie are actually quite good in their roles, and the physical resemblance is astounding. I, a lifelong fan, occasionally found myself completely accepting, especially the Joan character as the real thing. No small feat when playing a famous, contemporary person. The story adheres to the facts reasonably well, although it surprisingly softsoaps Kim Fowley, who in reality is a far more sinister figure than is portrayed here.While the acting and production values are generally good, the film fails pretty miserably at separating itself from the other 2,348 rock band movies we've all seen before. The cocaine snorting scene..the alcoholic dad scene..the singer quits scene..you get the idea.  Almost every shot is one that has been done exactly the same way at least thousand times. And with only the two members as the focus, there is barely a sense that they are even IN a band. This is a bit of a problem for a movie that is supposedly about one. And I'm not exaggerating here. The director (or I would think producer) is apparently so terrified that you might catch a glimpse of another band member, there's some amusement to be found in watching the camera artfully bob and weave to make sure they stay out of frame in some scenes. Well, amusing if you're not Sandy Wests mother I assume. Although there is some politically correct nod to acknowledging the departed Ms. West by actually giving her character about 5 lines of dialogue, while Lita gets about three and Jackie gets none.Probably the most telling point in the film is at the end. Joan becomes a big star (of course so did Lita Ford not that the movie mentions this) and poor Cherie, languishing in obscurity calls a radio show that Joan is on for a chance to talk to her old pal. A final montage makes it clear that Joan becomes huge and her solo hit Bad Reputation plays as the credits roll. Not a Runaways song, a Joan Jett song.While part of me has to applaud this inspired way of getting some return on her publishing, as a film or story of The Runaways, Joan's movie is a disaster. If you are a Dakota Fanning fan, then by all means enjoy your soap opera and underage lesbian smootching.

Anyway on with the review...The story starts off pretty solid as the film meticulously recreates the humble beginings of the Runnaways as they meet up with a visionary manager and slowly developed into a real rock and roll band, but buy the time they start to hit it big there simply isnt enough of the film focused on their progress on their way to stardom. Even though they never became superstars, there was so much more to the story that is never told. Just when the girls start tasting a bit of fame the entire band falls apart after Currie decides to leave the group. From that point things hurry along far too fast and suddenly Joan Jett has already recorded here first solo album and the film is over and done with. So much of the true story was missing and its a little dissapointing. The good news is that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning do an admirable job at capturing the essence of both real life women, especially Stewart who had Jett down to a T. But again there is just a lot more this film could have told and its all missing. It takes some time to watch the band develop into solid performers, then it seems hurried along to find some kind of ending. I felt everything ran great up until the band splits up. I thought Hell, this movie is just getting great and they put a quick halt to it. That was a bit of a shame. The best part of this film is up until the Runaways get their first taste of fame when they play Japan, then it falls totally downward after that. A decent film that had more to say and didnt say it.

It is the bomb, the ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb of rock movies! Based on the novel ""Neon Angel: The Life Of A Runaway"" by Cherie Curie, director Floria Sigismondi crafts a very unique and refreshing look into the 70's, rock and roll, and the lives of some very talented females that changed the way the public viewed women in rock, when they were just teenagers.Dakota Fanning is superb in this! Dakota is a force to be reckoned with, a very uniquely talented actress! She breathes life into the film and gives a topnotch vibrant performance. And as for Kristin Stewart, I've not seen her in anything else that I know of (I flat out refuse to see any of the ""Twilight"" films!), but I can say that she shined like a diamond in this! She wasn't just 'playing' Joan Jett, it was like she WAS Joan Jett! And Michael Shannon's portrayal of manager Kim Fowley was spot on! You would almost think Shannon was Fowley's bastard son.However, I was a bit perplexed that there wasn't more attention on the rest of the band, mainly on Lita Ford. I am a fan of the Runaways, and I must say, had  you forgotten that Lita was in the band, this movie doesn't really help remind you. I was especially upset at the end when the credits started, and Joan Jett, Cherie Curie, and even Kim Fowley's future careers were mentioned, but not a word about how Lita went on to a very successful solo career. And there was hardly any mention at all of drummer Sandy West.I have sense watched the awesome documentary ""Edgeplay: The Story Of The Runaways"", and am even more flustered with this film. For one, after seeing the real Cherie Curie, I think the actress playing Marie Curie would have been a lot more of a suitable fit than Dakota Fanning! Don't get me wrong, I love Dakota, and think she did a marvelous job in this, but look for some footage of the real Cherie and see what I mean. I also have a huge problem with the film ignoring Jackie Fox and Vickie Blue, the real life bass players for the band, and substituting them with the fictional ""Robin"". WTF?! But, I still enjoy it for what it was, a good ""rock -n- roll"" movie. But, as a bio of the Runaways, I think it could have been  better.

1324046,AFJFXN42RZ3G2,B0034G4P6W,"R. DelParto ""Rose2""","[41, 46]","In the middle of the glitter and glam rock of Ziggy Stardust, sappy contemporary love songs, and upon the threshold of the disco era, a revolutionary genre of music was skirting right behind, the punk era of the mid to late 1970s and a Southern California all girl rock band called the Runaways.  Indeed, one of rock and roll history's unsung bands to have emerged in musical history.  The film adaptation of the rise and fall of the band is an eye-opening experience, especially for those who may not have heard of the band or may have had a small inkling of exposure of the music of any one of the band members, most famously, Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart), Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton), Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning), Sandy West (Stella Maeve), and Jackie Fox; Fox is given the fictitious name of Robin (Alia Shawkat) due to her refusal to use her name in the film.  Director Floria Sigismondi captures the decade with the images, the fashion, gender-bender appeal, and most importantly, the music of the Runaways that provide the soundtrack for the film.The film does a good job showing a by-gone era that has long passed from platform shoes, bell-bottom jeans, and feathered-hairdos that typified the 70s.  But the Runaways along with their male counterparts, the Ramones helped the listening public keep abreast with guitar driven rock amidst the dance fever that was riding the wave of the decade.  However, fame and success does not come without unfortunate circumstances, ironies, and clich&eacute;s that are explicitly displayed throughout this fairytale rags to riches story.  It is these aspects that make the band's story interesting in two instances.  First, young women barely 18 years old and making a name for themselves by playing, singing, and strutting their rock stage stuff within a male-dominated business that was highly charged with sexism during the height of the women liberation and feminist movement, which the women in the band were not trying to prove, but rather the opportunity to simply land a record contract, signed with Mercury Records, and to play rock and roll music in a man's world. This is stressed throughout the film by the girls' somewhat conniving manager/impresario Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) who keeps the male-chauvinistic and raunchy sexual innuendo flying as he shows and trains the girls how to be rockstars and claims that the band will be as big as The Beatles; not quite but had a similar following with the mania and gaining fans as far as Japan.  Second, the spotlight and melodramatic scenes of lead singer Cherie, her close relationship with her sister Marie, living within the shadow of her actress mother (played by Tatum O'Neal) and her downward spiral due to band member rivalry and drug addiction and guitarist and singer Joan who helped to keep the rock and roll spirit alive despite the tensions that surmounted that would eventually cause the band's demise but would reemerge as a solo artist to sing the most identifiable rock anthems, ""I Love Rock and Roll.""The Runaways is an enticing film filled with nostalgia and the music.

Punk was all too often more about having the right snotty attitude  and fashion (non)sense than making meaningful music.  This irritating and predictable ""biography"" of the notorious 70's girl group the Runaways is heavy on the 'tude and snottiness and light on engagement or well-defined characters. Or maybe the point is that these characters, apart from Joan Jett whose in-your-face bad-assedness is at least counterbalanced by her innate drive and single-minded devotion to making music, were not serious about anything except escaping from LA suburbia and being rich and famous.  There's a lot of heavy-handed play-acting and pose-striking  in this offering but precious little insight or genuine drama. Hysterics, profanity,  and campy performances substitute for character development and a melodramatic teen angst is all the motivation we see from the Runaways, most of whom apart from Jett and Cherie Currie are treated as afterthoughts by the filmmaker. If this  sketch of a raw punk band composed of white suburban girls is designed to shock, it quickly becomes tedious and the very opposite of empowering. Whatever feminist point is trying to be made  here is lost in histronics and bogus preening.  If the Runaways were such champions of ""grrl power,"" why are they so meekly in thrall to Kim Fowley's creepy svengali figure?  Why do they buy into all the usual macho bulls*** just because it's tarted up in feathered haircuts, lipstick, and leather pants? That's not consciousness-raising, it's just imitation and selling out. An argument can be made that the Runaways, promoted as a novelty act all too willing to play up to their jailbait image (I mean, come on, ""We're the queens of noise, come and get it, boys"" is hardly a feminist manifesto, even with the confused line ""Not just one of your toys"" thrown in. So which is it, ladies?) made it even harder for the all-female bands that came after them to be taken seriously.I hope that the real Runaways weren't as shallow or unaware as the manipulated poseurs portrayed here, although in their defense they were all very young and seem to have mostly come from unstable or unhappy homes.  And it was the high-rolling, anything-goes, please-yourself  Seventies. Their music doesn't really hold up that well -- it doesn't merit the claims that they were  going to be bigger than the Beatles or even ever anywhere close to having the same impact on society. If anything, the Runaways seemed to be more about having a good time, getting wasted, and taking teenage rebellion to its maximum extremes. There's nothing terribly novel or interesting in this as the film shows it.  I regret not seeing Michael Steele, pre-Bangles, who was briefly in the Runaways but kicked out under circumstances still murky (one report is that she was ""too nice,"" which may just mean she wouldn't put up with Fowley's pervy advances). And they allowed themselves to be chewed up by the same industry they decried, although Lita Ford carved out a solo music career, and of course there's Joan Jett, who was and remains a tough, perceptive individual with loads of talent and enough self-awareness to escape the pitfalls of fame for the most part (her commentary shows how basically well-adjusted she is, or became,  compared to the hell-raiser of legend and cinema).",2,Empty posing does not a punk rock film make,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",2013,3327,"['maybe', 'Punk', 'was', 'too', 'often', 'more', 'having', 'right', 'snotty', 'attitude', 'fashion', 'non', 'sense', 'making', 'meaningful', 'music', 'irritating', 'predictable', 'biography', 'notorious', '70', 'girl', 'group', 'Runaways', 'heavy', ""'tude"", 'snottiness', 'light', 'engagement', 'well-defined', 'characters', 'maybe', 'point', 'characters', 'apart', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'in-your-face', 'bad-assedness', 'least', 'counterbalanced', 'innate', 'drive', 'single-minded', 'devotion', 'making', 'music', 'were', 'not', 'serious', 'anything', 'escaping', 'LA', 'suburbia', 'being', 'rich', 'famous', 'lot', 'heavy-handed', 'play-acting', 'pose-striking', 'offering', 'precious', 'little', 'insight', 'genuine', 'drama', 'Hysterics', 'profanity', 'campy', 'performances', 'substitute', 'character', 'development', 'melodramatic', 'teen', 'angst', 'motivation', 'see', 'Runaways', 'most', 'whom', 'apart', 'Jett', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'are', 'treated', 'afterthoughts', 'filmmaker', 'sketch', 'raw', 'punk', 'band', 'composed', 'white', 'suburban', 'girls', 'designed', 'shock', 'quickly', 'tedious', 'very', 'opposite', 'empowering', 'feminist', 'point', 'trying', 'be', 'made', 'here', 'lost', 'histronics', 'bogus', 'preening', 'Runaways', 'were', 'such', 'champions', 'grrl', 'power', 'why', 'are', 'so', 'meekly', 'thrall', 'Kim', 'Fowley', 'creepy', 'svengali', 'figure', 'Why', 'do', 'buy', 'usual', 'macho', 'bulls***', 'just', 'tarted', 'up', 'feathered', 'haircuts', 'lipstick', 'leather', 'pants', 'not', 'consciousness-raising', 'just', 'imitation', 'selling', 'out', 'argument', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'Runaways', 'promoted', 'novelty', 'act', 'too', 'willing', 'play', 'up', 'jailbait', 'image', 'mean', 'come', ""'re"", 'queens', 'noise', 'come', 'get', 'boys', 'hardly', 'feminist', 'manifesto', 'even', 'confused', 'line', 'Not', 'just', 'one', 'toys', 'thrown', 'So', 'ladies', 'made', 'even', 'harder', 'all-female', 'bands', 'came', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.I', 'hope', 'real', 'Runaways', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'shallow', 'unaware', 'manipulated', 'poseurs', 'portrayed', 'here', 'defense', 'were', 'very', 'young', 'seem', 'have', 'mostly', 'come', 'unstable', 'unhappy', 'homes', 'was', 'high-rolling', 'anything-goes', 'please-yourself', 'Seventies', 'music', ""n't"", 'really', 'hold', 'up', 'well', ""n't"", 'merit', 'claims', 'were', 'going', 'be', 'bigger', 'Beatles', 'even', 'ever', 'anywhere', 'close', 'having', 'same', 'impact', 'society', 'anything', 'Runaways', 'seemed', 'be', 'more', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'getting', 'wasted', 'taking', 'teenage', 'rebellion', 'maximum', 'extremes', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'novel', 'interesting', 'film', 'regret', 'not', 'seeing', 'Michael', 'Steele', 'pre-Bangles', 'who', 'was', 'briefly', 'Runaways', 'kicked', 'out', 'circumstances', 'still', 'murky', 'one', 'report', 'was', 'too', 'nice', 'may', 'just', 'mean', 'would', ""n't"", 'put', 'up', 'Fowley', 'pervy', 'advances', 'allowed', 'be', 'chewed', 'up', 'same', 'industry', 'decried', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'carved', 'out', 'solo', 'music', 'career', 'course', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'who', 'was', 'tough', 'perceptive', 'individual', 'loads', 'talent', 'enough', 'self-awareness', 'escape', 'pitfalls', 'fame', 'most', 'part', 'commentary', 'how', 'basically', 'well-adjusted', 'became', 'compared', 'hell-raiser', 'legend', 'cinema']",N/A

Or they just have a need to have their eye on the Oscar-driven prize like ""Walk the Line.""The Runawaysfits none of the categories above.Filmed for less than $10m,The Runawaysis an unpretentious romp of a bygone era. It earns its polyester points on its authentic vibe of bad hair and great music.As the movie is loosely based on Cherie Curie's autobiography, Neon Angel, it is Dakota Fanning, as Curie, who has the lead role. Fanning does a decent job of portraying the needy Curie who isn't quite fragile but not quite stable either (but who is at 15?). There were a few times when Fanning seemed a little out of her depth but overall, the performance is solid.In the pivotal role of Joan Jett, Kristen Stewart takes on every known nuance that is Joan Jett. From the slouchy style of performing to the sexy androgyny that made her famous. It almost seems like Stewart was born to play Jett. Stewart's Jett is focused in a non-showy way which is in keeping with Jett herself. Another actress may have felt pressure to take it up a notch but perhaps Jett, who was on-set for much of the filming, advised Stewart to keep it lower key. Whoever advised it, it seems a good choice as Stewart provides the charismatic anchor in Joan to Fanning's beautiful but flaky Cherie.But the real movie stealer is Michael Shannon as the robust, raunchy, redoubtable Kim Fowley. A Svengali who was manipulative, abusive and yet, he delivered. Its a showy part but Fowley was a showy guy and Shannon chews it up and spits it out and grabs it back to chew it some more. When he's in a scene, the movie pops and goes up more than a few notches.There are some downsides to the movie. The audience doesn't get to see how band members Lita Ford and composite bassist ""Robin"" becomes part of the band.

Maybe a problem is that the Runaways are not an interesting enough band to make a movie about. Perhaps, probably a bigger problem is the approach that the director took in the presentation.The Runaways were a pioneering band yet, at the time when they came out, they really were not that talented. With the exception of ""Cherry Bomb"", their songs are pretty unlistenable today. Now, this critique of their music is not fair since, when they formed, it was essentially a concept band and these girls were just 15-16 years old. As nothing of a band that the Runaways were, Joan Jett blossomed into a great talent and she is a worthy ""rock star"". Too a lesser extent, Lita Ford, also developed into a legitimate musical talent as well. Obviously, the assembling of these girls, in this band, from a historical perspective, meant something and, therefore, the band stands for more than hype. However, their musical impact has nothing to do with the watchability of a film.What really sours this film is the tone of the movie. Usually, a movie about rock and roll is exuberant and uplifting. It should make you want to sing, dance and celebrate with the band. This film does the opposite. It's the biggest downer of a movie I'd ever experienced about rock and roll.1970's Los Angeles is portrayed as dejected teens, dysfunctional families, mean-spirited high schools, catty girls, and apathetic parents. Even the landscape of  the area is painted in grayish and darkened tones. In this movie, ""sunny"" California is not sunny.With the exception of a little from drummer, Sandy West, all the members are portrayed as flawed and disturbed. This film is too much character study and not enough drama, but despite that, you really never get to learn much about the characters.The film has, what I think, is a terrible way to narrarate. The film focuses on mundane and nominal issues...almost playing like a reality show. This is the wrong approach since, in a movie, things SHOULD be amped up, in a cinematic manner, to make the viewing more entertaining.A good filmmaker can take something that doesn't initially appear that cinematic, and through their creativity, make it exciting. This director seems to have taken the worst possible approach in the tone, style and narraration of the movie. The movie never celebrated the music! A historical movie about a band should make the viewer interested in exploring and investigating more about a band. This movie did not.While the acting was fantastic, especially in capturing Joan Jett and Cherie Currie, doing an ""impersonation"" is not the same as entertaining.Anybody that is a fan of The Runaways or Joan Jett should detest this movie since there was no heralding of your band.",2,"A mopey, dreary, aimless bore",1299024000,"03 2, 2011",2011,2757,"['What', 'disappointment', 'movie', 'was', 'Maybe', 'problem', 'Runaways', 'are', 'not', 'interesting', 'enough', 'band', 'make', 'movie', 'Perhaps', 'probably', 'bigger', 'problem', 'approach', 'director', 'took', 'presentation.The', 'Runaways', 'were', 'pioneering', 'band', 'yet', 'time', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'really', 'were', 'not', 'talented', 'exception', 'Cherry', 'Bomb', 'songs', 'are', 'pretty', 'unlistenable', 'today', 'Now', 'critique', 'music', 'not', 'fair', 'when', 'formed', 'was', 'essentially', 'concept', 'band', 'girls', 'were', 'just', '15-16', 'years', 'old', 'nothing', 'band', 'Runaways', 'were', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'blossomed', 'great', 'talent', 'worthy', 'rock', 'star', 'Too', 'lesser', 'extent', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'also', 'developed', 'legitimate', 'musical', 'talent', 'as', 'well', 'Obviously', 'assembling', 'girls', 'band', 'historical', 'perspective', 'meant', 'something', 'therefore', 'band', 'more', 'hype', 'However', 'musical', 'impact', 'nothing', 'do', 'watchability', 'really', 'film', 'tone', 'movie', 'Usually', 'movie', 'rock', 'roll', 'exuberant', 'uplifting', 'should', 'make', 'want', 'sing', 'dance', 'celebrate', 'band', 'film', 'opposite', 'biggest', 'downer', 'movie', ""'d"", 'ever', 'experienced', 'rock', 'roll.1970', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'portrayed', 'dejected', 'teens', 'dysfunctional', 'families', 'mean-spirited', 'high', 'schools', 'catty', 'girls', 'apathetic', 'parents', 'Even', 'landscape', 'area', 'painted', 'grayish', 'darkened', 'tones', 'movie', 'sunny', 'California', 'not', 'sunny.With', 'exception', 'little', 'drummer', 'Sandy', 'West', 'members', 'are', 'portrayed', 'flawed', 'disturbed', 'film', 'too', 'much', 'character', 'study', 'not', 'enough', 'drama', 'really', 'never', 'get', 'learn', 'much', 'characters.The', 'film', 'what', 'think', 'terrible', 'way', 'narrarate', 'film', 'mundane', 'nominal', 'issues', 'almost', 'playing', 'reality', 'show', 'wrong', 'approach', 'movie', 'things', 'SHOULD', 'be', 'amped', 'up', 'cinematic', 'manner', 'make', 'viewing', 'more', 'entertaining.A', 'good', 'filmmaker', 'can', 'take', 'something', ""n't"", 'initially', 'appear', 'cinematic', 'creativity', 'make', 'exciting', 'director', 'have', 'taken', 'worst', 'possible', 'approach', 'tone', 'style', 'narraration', 'movie', 'movie', 'never', 'celebrated', 'music', 'historical', 'movie', 'band', 'should', 'make', 'viewer', 'interested', 'exploring', 'investigating', 'more', 'band', 'movie', 'did', 'acting', 'was', 'fantastic', 'especially', 'capturing', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Cherie', 'Currie', 'doing', 'impersonation', 'not', 'same', 'entertaining.Anybody', 'fan', 'Runaways', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'should', 'detest', 'movie', 'was', 'heralding', 'band']",N/A

I'd seen everything Robert Pattinson put out and Taylor Lautner, so why not Kristen Stewart? Although I was bored with the whoa-is-me attitude on the ""Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)"" series, that was actually the way Bella was in the book. I was a little put off by how shell-shocked Kristin Stewart looks during interviews (can't be a well-known actress and be freaked out by the public, too), but when I saw ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part I,"" I saw her show another side of herself. She became a little lighter and had some comedic scenes. I read an interview where Taylor Lautner said Kristen is one of the funniest people he knows so I'm like, ""OK, maybe we just aren't seeing it. Let me see if I can find it in her other roles."" But every single role she plays is this person who is lost, depressed, mumbling, uncomfortable and just plain miserable. I can't do it anymore. I tried to give her a shot. In ""Adventureland"" she STILL managed to be the depressed, lost character, but I did like that movie (more because of Jesse Eisenberg though).I tried to make it through ""Welcome to the Rileys"" but couldn't stay interested in that film. In this movie (or maybe it was the other one? Same depressed character so it's hard to separate the films), she's the exact same character. I can't tell whether she can act or not because she just keeps playing the same person she acts like during interviews. I want her to break out and do something challenging, something where she doesn't look like she's going to burst into tears or commit suicide at any given moment.The beginning of this film was so gross I almost turned the movie off. Blood spilled down one girl's leg and they went to the bathroom to stuff her underwear. Talk about a ""raw"" film. That threw me completely. But I kept trying. There was a bunch of mumbling about starting a girl band. More mumbling during ""singing."" I was just bored. After a half n' hour, I gave up, and I usually try to finish films I start.

Now I've not read Currie's memoir, but my guess is that it focuses more on Currie and less on Jett. However, the movie indeed was co-produced by Jett, so I guess that I really shouldn't have been too surprised.Guitarist Lita Ford and Drummer Sandy West get little screen time, and even fewer lines. And any of the (I think it was three) real bass guitarists I don't think were even mentioned. The story focuses on Jett and Currie's relationship and personal lives more than it does the music, but don't get me wrong, music certainly is a major part of the movie.The most interesting part of the music was watching the start up of the band and watching Record Producer Kim Fowley's major involvement. The biggest letdown of the movie was the omission of major parts of The Runaways touring days and tales of the road.I happened to see The Runaways with The Ramones circa 1977 (at the Palladium in Passaic NJ I think it was). What a crazy show and I'm sure that most of the shows were just as crazy. Man, during The Runaways entire set I'll never forget the crowd chats, and let me tell you that the crowd was mostly chanting for crude favors versus more music. It would have been very interesting to see how the band dealt with that aspect of their career...and especially while out on the road with The Ramones.Overall I was entertained by The Runaways movie, but felt it was largely incomplete...from a touring detail perspective and from the perspective of telling all of the band members' stories.

""The Runaways,"" based on Cherie Curie's book and executive produced by Joan Jett and Kenny Laguna might as well have been called ""Cherie and Joan"" for all the depth it gave the rest of the band. Poor bassists Vickie Blue and Jackie Fox are replaced by ""Robin."" Lita Ford, who did have a successful solo career post Runaways, is portrayed minimally, and then as a shrill, jealous harpy. Like Lita, Sandy West becomes a background figure who is mentioned only when Kim Fowley introduces her to Joan near the beginning of the movie. Then, in almost insulting fashion in the movie's epilogue, only Jett, Curie and Fowley's status gets mentioned.While ""The Runaways"" does feature the band's best known songs (albeit re-recorded), it really shorts the band overall. There's way too much time spent on druggy hazes and a lesbian subplot when a bit more interest in the band might have made this more interesting. It also allows Michael Shannon, playing Kim Fowley like a glammed up Dennis Leary, to steal the show. It's curious to note that, as profane and ludicrous as Fowley is made out to be in the film, in real life he was allegedly even worse. Like most sharks, he smelled blood money in the water and exploited it at every turn.Fortunately, in real life Joan Jett survives the band's breakup, which is where the story concludes. Which also is a highlight of the movie; Kristen Stewart does a terrific job as Joan Jett, even down to the singing.

It was suppose to come out in theaters where i live according to the box office but the day came and whammo, no runaways.  I think they did a great job.  Things were changed a bit if you go by the book in which it was inspired ""Neon Angel"" by cherrie currie but from the dvd edgeplay, i take it they all had their own opinions about what happened and how bad it was.  If you've read Neon Angel and are thinking what i thought ""thats a pretty brutal book, do you really wanta watch that"", the answer is this, they sugar coated that book to heck and back..  They brought in more joan (which the book was seriously lacking) and rounded it out into more of a story....I love the movie. I think it bottles the spirit of the runaways but ok for what i didn't likedakota fannings acting was strained.  She just didn't have the bad girl thing going on and to me she came off as just melodramatic.  (she's a great actress but i don't think she was right for the part)They made up a fake character to take jackie foxxes place by the name of robin robins and for a memoir that kinda sucks...  They also switched up who knocked over the guitar.Dakota goes in the bathroom and cuts her hair off.  In the movie you have no knowledge of what pushed her to take such a drastic measure when the truth is shed just been raped.  Im not saying they should have showed the rape scene because I was worried about that. I really didn't want to see that but the could have let the viewer know.It was not dedicated in the memory of Sandy West who died before it was released.Up note!Kristen Stewart pulled off Joan Jett beautifullyScout Taylor compton embodied Lita Ford (and looked just like her)and whoever that girl is who played Sandy West blew me away.  Id love to see her in more.  She was adorable.In all, its a great movie to kick back on a friday night with a 6 pack of beer and go back to a time where rock was raw.",5,its not a movie i watch all the time but sometimes i get that hankering,1338076800,"05 27, 2012",2012,1948,"['waited', 'waited', 'movie', 'come', 'out', 'was', 'suppose', 'come', 'out', 'theaters', 'where', 'i', 'live', 'according', 'box', 'office', 'day', 'came', 'whammo', 'runaways', 'think', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'Things', 'were', 'changed', 'bit', 'go', 'book', 'was', 'inspired', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'cherrie', 'currie', 'dvd', 'edgeplay', 'i', 'take', 'had', 'own', 'opinions', 'what', 'happened', 'how', 'bad', 'was', ""'ve"", 'read', 'Neon', 'Angel', 'are', 'thinking', 'what', 'i', 'thought', 'thats', 'pretty', 'brutal', 'book', 'do', 'really', 'wanta', 'watch', 'answer', 'sugar', 'coated', 'book', 'heck', 'back..', 'brought', 'more', 'joan', 'book', 'was', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'rounded', 'out', 'more', 'story', 'love', 'movie', 'think', 'spirit', 'runaways', 'ok', 'what', 'i', 'did', ""n't"", 'likedakota', 'fannings', 'acting', 'was', 'strained', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'bad', 'girl', 'thing', 'going', 'came', 'off', 'as', 'just', 'melodramatic', 'great', 'actress', 'i', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'right', 'part', 'made', 'up', 'fake', 'character', 'take', 'jackie', 'foxxes', 'place', 'name', 'robin', 'robins', 'memoir', 'sucks', 'also', 'switched', 'up', 'who', 'knocked', 'guitar.Dakota', 'bathroom', 'hair', 'off', 'movie', 'have', 'knowledge', 'what', 'pushed', 'take', 'drastic', 'measure', 'when', 'truth', 'shed', 'just', 'been', 'raped', 'Im', 'not', 'saying', 'should', 'have', 'showed', 'rape', 'scene', 'was', 'worried', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'see', 'could', 'have', 'let', 'viewer', 'know.It', 'was', 'not', 'dedicated', 'memory', 'Sandy', 'West', 'who', 'died', 'was', 'released.Up', 'note', 'Kristen', 'Stewart', 'pulled', 'off', 'Joan', 'Jett', 'Taylor', 'compton', 'embodied', 'Lita', 'Ford', 'looked', 'just', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Sandy', 'West', 'blew', 'away', 'Id', 'love', 'see', 'more', 'was', 'adorable.In', 'all', 'great', 'movie', 'kick', 'back', 'friday', 'night', '6', 'pack', 'beer', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'rock', 'was', 'raw']",N/A

I'm sure she will be able to transition into a successful adult actress.The movie was exciting and told the story of the Runaways primarily based on Cherie Currie's perspective (based after her book).I'm not sure how influential the Runaways really were in this country...I think Joan Jett's career with the Blackhearts was more influential for women in music than the Runaways were, but it's a movie definitely worth watching!

With the exception of Joan Jett, not many people know her roots in the runaways.  I believe this film was based on Cherie curie's book and Joan Jett helped with the production.  At this point, the film was ok, kinda slow, and honestly, some of the stuff behind the scenes I didn't want to know, I think they pushed the psudosexual side of the story up for dramatic effect, and that just got tiring.
