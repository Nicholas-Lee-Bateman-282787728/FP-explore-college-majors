This one really confused me.The film is about solitude of a human being in a tough world, beautifully describing how easy you may plunge in mayhem, without drawing the compassion of any person. Hence, the final act that you would commit might eventually -and falsely- draw the loathing of others, as a last and unique gesture of compassion.There is no real scenario in the film; it is made of sequenced sketches picturing the life of very ordinary person. There is a suicide of a beautiful girl, to reach her deformed body and pathetic end on the bed of the hospital. There is another beautiful girl, who chooses to keep running, like burning time will give you a lighter pain. There is a friend, with strong attitude and confidence, but his non-human approach is not an idol. Finally, there is the principal character pushed by this great emptiness to... anything available.Yet, you are anxious to reach the extent where the blow of all the frustration is coming: being the end of the mayhem (Polanski choose a violent death in this case). And albeit everything was presented in a tragic way, you still have a comic feeling about silliness, a silliness that unfortunately may end by a death.It was possible to avoid that death, by finding a suitable and ordinary lover, a nice neighbor or an understanding friend that can give you time; but the movie was picturing the extremist, the status where the human soul couldn't make it.This movie is almost identical with Taxi Driver; however, the reaction of the frustrated human took a different, more optimistic -yet more American- phase there.It is one of the rare movies that strongly motivate you, get you scared of what could happen or confidence that you are &quot;doing well&quot;.

Roman Polanski's quote as he stands in front of the mirror of his dank apartment dressed as a woman and slowly losing it while thinking hes the target of a plot to have him commit suicide by his landlord and fellow tenants...This is the 2nd Roman Polanski film ive seen so far and I think I enjoyed this film even more than Rosemary's Baby. You cant really put this film into words or categorize it. Its truly an eerie creepy slow moving film. Despite the fact it can be slow at times you still cant take your eyes off of it. I was enthralled by Polanski's character and portrayal of the polish immigrant living as the tenant in Paris. The overall atmosphere, the paranoia, the alienation and the plot are engaging. Ive seen many movies and this is unlike any other ive ever seen. It not only has the suspense and story which pulls you in deeper as the story progresses but it also has plenty of black humor to it. I laughed out loud in a couple scenes.As soon as this film was over I turned it off then put it back on the shelf, but as the days went by I just kept thinking about it and wanting to watch it again. There is so much more to this film than meets the eye, ideas to contemplate, etc.. After i watched it and it sunk in over the days i was thinking , this is truly a great film. One of a kind.

707772,ACD7FOP0APSR0,B000069I09,bill and phil does not matter,"[6, 8]","This is a great psychological thriller by Roman Polanski, who wisely cast himself into the lead role.  It takes place in Paris at an apartment building where the previous tenant killed herself by jumping off her balcony & breaking her neck.Trelkovsky (Polanski) is a reclusive guy who hears about the apartment & gladly takes the room.  He slowly gets cold & evil stares by his neighbors & fellow tenants.  He starts to see clues left behind the previous tenant, a tooth in the wall, some Egyptian writing, & articles of clothing.  He after a time, dresses up like her in one scene & talks about how he's pregnant.  He visits Stella (Isabelle Adjani), his friend & lover.One of the most effective non-Polanski roles would go to Shelley Winters as his landlady, who at first brushes him off like he's lost his marbles, but then becomes more like everyone else there.  Trelkovsky believes that the people are out to get him & wish for him to do the same thing as his previous tenant. He tries to kill himself towards the end, but only breaks his leg, tries again, & succeeds at it then after believing that dying is better than staying in the place any longer.  He really wants to get out of the place, but can't afford to at all.Roman Polanski masterfully ties in elements of the supernatural throughout the movie, the pace is very slow but not enough to be boring.  The music is perfect for the mood of the flick, as is the camerawork & the casting.  Starring the likes of:  Isabelle Adjani, Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, & Shelley Winters, it has a strong cast.

707774,AODKUG6FAKD2Z,B000069I09,"Bryan Byrd ""reviewer of bad films and good books""","[6, 10]","Having read Roland Topor's masterful novel 'The Tenant' only a few weeks ago, I was primed and ready for Roman Polanski's take on the persecuted and haunted character of Trelkovsky.  Though I am more familiar with Mr. Polanski's reputation as a filmmaker than with his films, I did expect him to bring a singular vision to the adaptation - even if that vision differed from my interpretation.  That it does, but where the film clumsily stumbles is in its failure to show the cause and effect necessary to support even the director's view.'The Tenant' is the story of Trelkovsky, an unassuming everyman, who takes an apartment recently vacated by a woman, Simone Choule, who committed suicide.  Once settled, he starts finding artifacts of Mlle. Choule's around the apartment that have an unhealthy attraction for him.  Coupled with that, he has continuous problems from his neighbors, who constantly harangue him with complaints about noise coming from his apartment.  The lingering presence of Mlle. Choule, the harassment by his neighbors, and the slow disintegration of Trelkovsky's identity lead him to believe that his neighbors are scheming to turn him into a copy of Mlle. Choule - and for him to suffer her same fate.It may be unfair to review the film so soon after reading the source material, but because of that exposure, I do know that for the first two-thirds of the movie, Mr. Polanski was almost obsequious in his faithfulness.  Much of the dialogue came straight from the book, and the actors were outstanding in their roles (including a stellar turn by Shelley Winters).  Mr. Polanski himself, as Trelkovsky, nailed the timid title character exactly as I had pictured him, but as the character loses his grip on reality, I was disappointed to see that the director's view diverged so radically from mine.The Question: are the neighbor's threats all in Trelkovsky's mind, or is something more infernal going on?  I felt the novel might have been a mixture of both, though mostly I had the impression there was a real, external danger.  Mr. Polanski's version ignored that possibility, and presented the horror as all inside Trelkovsky's head.  But does it matter since both narratives share the same events right up to the end?  I think so, as that makes the movie only a psychological chiller - the novel is a much more frightening allegory of humanity's cloven-footed habits throughout history.Since each opinion is valid, I can't penalize a film that doesn't conform to my preconceived ideas - but I can dock it for failing to present its own views adequately.  I can accept bizarre characters and storylines, but the established elements must evolve during the film along believable lines.  When Trelkovsky dons a housedress left behind by Mlle. Choule, and paints his face with cosmetics, it struck me that the film hadn't provided enough underpinning for his actions.  Knowing what I knew about the story, I could see that the clues were there - just carefully hidden - but I felt that someone else watching might be scratching their head and wondering what Mr. Polanski was thinking.  Trelkovsky seemed to go from a timid cipher to a cross-dressing lunatic for little or no reason.  Granted, the reasons were in his mind, which is difficult to present on screen, but I believe I would have had a hard time understanding his motivations, including those that influenced his decisions at the movie's end, from the film's storyline alone.It's possible that I'm being too harsh, and that those unfamiliar with the book will still be able to easily follow along with the movie.  I will say that the film should appeal to viewers with a heightened appreciation for subtle nuance, and that those who are used to a more contemporary presentation of horror may want to take a pass.  Those in the middle, like me, but without prior information, may find 'The Tenant' to be a well-acted, interesting film - right up until it falls apart in the final act.",3,"Roman Polanski's Faithful, but Ultimately Flawed Adaptation of The Tenant",1244160000,"06 5, 2009",2009,3967,"['Having', 'read', 'Roland', 'Topor', 'masterful', 'novel', 'Tenant', 'only', 'few', 'weeks', 'ago', 'was', 'primed', 'ready', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'take', 'persecuted', 'haunted', 'character', 'Trelkovsky', 'am', 'more', 'familiar', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'reputation', 'filmmaker', 'films', 'did', 'expect', 'bring', 'singular', 'vision', 'adaptation', 'even', 'vision', 'differed', 'interpretation', 'where', 'film', 'clumsily', 'stumbles', 'failure', 'show', 'cause', 'effect', 'necessary', 'support', 'even', 'director', 'view', 'Tenant', 'story', 'Trelkovsky', 'unassuming', 'everyman', 'who', 'apartment', 'recently', 'vacated', 'woman', 'Simone', 'Choule', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'Once', 'settled', 'finding', 'artifacts', 'Mlle', 'Choule', 'apartment', 'have', 'unhealthy', 'attraction', 'Coupled', 'continuous', 'problems', 'neighbors', 'who', 'constantly', 'harangue', 'complaints', 'noise', 'coming', 'apartment', 'lingering', 'presence', 'Mlle', 'Choule', 'harassment', 'neighbors', 'slow', 'disintegration', 'Trelkovsky', 'identity', 'lead', 'believe', 'neighbors', 'are', 'scheming', 'turn', 'copy', 'Mlle', 'Choule', 'suffer', 'same', 'fate.It', 'may', 'be', 'unfair', 'review', 'film', 'so', 'soon', 'reading', 'source', 'material', 'exposure', 'do', 'know', 'first', 'two-thirds', 'movie', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'was', 'almost', 'obsequious', 'faithfulness', 'Much', 'dialogue', 'came', 'straight', 'book', 'actors', 'were', 'outstanding', 'roles', 'including', 'stellar', 'turn', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'Trelkovsky', 'nailed', 'timid', 'title', 'character', 'exactly', 'had', 'pictured', 'character', 'grip', 'reality', 'was', 'disappointed', 'see', 'director', 'view', 'diverged', 'so', 'radically', 'mine.The', 'Question', 'are', 'neighbor', 'threats', 'Trelkovsky', 'mind', 'something', 'more', 'infernal', 'going', 'felt', 'novel', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'mixture', 'mostly', 'had', 'impression', 'was', 'real', 'external', 'danger', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'version', 'ignored', 'possibility', 'presented', 'horror', 'Trelkovsky', 'head', 'matter', 'narratives', 'share', 'same', 'events', 'right', 'up', 'end', 'think', 'so', 'movie', 'only', 'psychological', 'chiller', 'novel', 'much', 'more', 'frightening', 'allegory', 'humanity', 'cloven-footed', 'habits', 'history.Since', 'opinion', 'valid', 'ca', ""n't"", 'penalize', 'film', ""n't"", 'conform', 'preconceived', 'ideas', 'can', 'dock', 'failing', 'present', 'own', 'views', 'adequately', 'can', 'accept', 'bizarre', 'characters', 'storylines', 'established', 'elements', 'must', 'evolve', 'film', 'believable', 'lines', 'When', 'Trelkovsky', 'housedress', 'left', 'behind', 'Mlle', 'Choule', 'paints', 'face', 'cosmetics', 'struck', 'film', 'had', ""n't"", 'provided', 'enough', 'underpinning', 'actions', 'Knowing', 'what', 'knew', 'story', 'could', 'see', 'clues', 'were', 'just', 'carefully', 'hidden', 'felt', 'someone', 'else', 'watching', 'might', 'be', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'was', 'thinking', 'Trelkovsky', 'seemed', 'go', 'timid', 'cipher', 'cross-dressing', 'lunatic', 'little', 'reason', 'Granted', 'reasons', 'were', 'mind', 'difficult', 'present', 'screen', 'believe', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'motivations', 'including', 'influenced', 'decisions', 'movie', 'end', 'film', 'storyline', 'alone.It', 'possible', ""'m"", 'being', 'too', 'harsh', 'unfamiliar', 'book', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'able', 'easily', 'follow', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'should', 'appeal', 'viewers', 'heightened', 'appreciation', 'subtle', 'nuance', 'who', 'are', 'used', 'more', 'contemporary', 'presentation', 'horror', 'may', 'want', 'take', 'pass', 'middle', 'prior', 'information', 'may', 'find', ""'The"", 'Tenant', 'be', 'well-acted', 'interesting', 'film', 'right', 'up', 'apart', 'final', 'act']",The Tenant

707777,A25ZVI6RH1KA5L,B000069I09,"cookieman108 ""cookieman108""","[5, 11]","Why do French films have to be so patently weird?  This is what I was thinking as I watched The Tenant (1976) last night.  And not just weird, but make so very little sense?  Watching this film, I had flashbacks of Johnny Depp's 1999 film The Ninth Gate, which made about as much sense as The Tenant.  I've read that The Tenant, directed, co-written, and starring Roman Polanski (who also did The Ninth Gate), is supposed to be the third in a trilogy of films dealing with horror placed upon peoples in an urban setting (like they don't have enough problems with astronomical rent, limited parking, and cockroaches), the first being Repulsion (1965), followed by the second in Rosemary's Baby (1968).  Well, having seen all three, I'd have to say The Tenant is probably the least accessible of the three, but still pretty watchable, if you can get past the frustrations due to seemingly incoherent storyline and a less than straight-forward ending.  If you need your films to make sense, then skip The Tenant as you will be annoyed, bored, and generally feel compelled to come on here and offer a derogatory rant as to why people who like this film are pretentious art house goons who tout it thinking it's cool solely on the basis that it makes very little sense.  Also appearing in the film is Isabelle Adjani (Subway), Melvyn Douglas (Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House), Jo Van Fleet (Cool Hand Luke), and Shelley Winters (The Great Gatsby, The Night of the Hunter), as The Concierge (sort of like the landlady, except her responsibilities are limited to attending to the entrance, collection and distribution of the mail, and serving as janitor).The film, set in France, stars Polanski as the relatively meek Trelkovsky, a modest man searching for an apartment.  As luck would have it, one has finally opened up, but Trelkovsky learns the reason for the vacancy is the last tenant tried to commit suicide, or, at least it appears that way.  Also, as it turns out, she's still alive, but not in any condition to contest her losing her apartment, and soon passes due to her many injuries.  Trelkovsky does move in, and thus begins his painfully slow descent into the dismal, delusionary, persecutory nether regions of that oft transgressed area we know as `the mentally disturbed'...one could say his visits to the dementia buffet are increasing at an exponential rate.  The question soon becomes is all that he's experiencing a product of a defective mind (Repulsion), or is it all well-orchestrated conspiracy aimed at drawing in a victim who's now inexorably forever linked to a nefarious scheme (Rosemary's Baby)?  Or both?  Or neither?  (well, that doesn't seem to make a lot of sense, but then neither did the film, so deal with it).  Oh wait, there's a third possibility...that of possession...it's certainly hinted at...As I eluded to earlier, The Tenant seems to take liberally from Polanski's previous films, Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby, retaining much of what made those films so well received, but lacks the coherence of either.  There's a lot to appreciate here, especially Polanski's performance, but the rewards are far and few between.  The one scene that comes to my mind is when Trelkovsky first visits the apartment building, meeting Winter's character for the first time, trying to get information about the vacant apartment.  He sees a little wiener dog sitting on the couch, and in a feeble effort to get into the Concierge's good graces, he comments on what a cute dog it is, and tries to pet it, to which the wee dog bares its' teeth and snaps at Trelkovsky, twice, setting up a pattern seen throughout the film of other characters and how they view Trelkovsky in general, with disdain and distrust (his character is basically a doormat throughout the film, allowing for anyone and everyone to walk all over him).  Polanski's character, seemingly a victim, comes off as less than likable, especially when he visits the hospital to check on the condition of the previous tenant, apparently waiting for her to finally pass before settling on moving into her now vacant apartment.  This all seemed rather ghoulish to me...and then his budding relationship with the previous tenant's best friend, Stella (Adjani), her mourning and trying to come to terms with the loss of her friend while Trelkovsky presents the pretense of actually knowing the deceased woman, his web of lies ever growing, made him appear even more creepy (and things do get creepier...much more so, especially once he finds the previous tenant's clothes).  The story eludes to many things happening, but there's little to tie everything together into a cohesive storyline (what was with the tooth in the hole in the wall?  And those hieroglyphics in the bathroom?  The significance escaped me on both of these matters).  Despite this, Polanski does manage to keep the atmosphere throughout tense and fraught with an impending sense of danger (the Kafka-esque quality some speak of), but I felt the payoff too little when compared to the slow, lengthy buildup.  The production looks wonderful, as do the interiors and very realistic location shots in Paris.  You could almost feel the dingy crawling off the wall and onto your skin of Trelkovsky's less than desirable bachelor pad.  I did feel the strengths tended to outweigh the weaknesses of this film, but I can't help feel after spending just over two hours watching this movie there should have been something more tangible waiting for me at the end.  I appreciate everything the film is (some of which I'm still unsure), but I can't shake the feeling of that of a lab rat, subject to an experiment I couldn't possibly understand.The widescreen anamorphic picture on this DVD looks much better than the price seemed to suggest.  Also, the audio was strong and clear.  The only special feature is an original theatrical trailer.Cookieman108",3,Welcome to the Psychosis Arms...we have a vacancy...,1102982400,"12 14, 2004",2004,5891,"['Why', 'do', 'French', 'films',

The victim a young woman Simone Choule plummeted through a window crashing through a glass roof before hitting the ground.Polanski moves in after being okayed by suspicious landlord Monsieur Zy played by veteran actor Melvyn Douglas.  His neighbors take an annoying stance with him pestering him with demands and conditions he must follow.Within short order Polanski finds himself falling into the same habits as the dead girl, frequenting the same restaurants, ordering the same food , smoking the same brand of cigarettes.  Polanski gradually falls into a paranoic madness imagining the neighbors are plotting to drive him to a similar suicide attempt.  He eventually loses it completely dressing in drag and donning a wig, in his mind becoming the suicide victim Simone Choule.Polanski demonstrates an expansive imagination in his creation of the madness surrounding this outlandish film.

If dark movies aren't your cup of tea, you might give it a 2 or 3. The Tenant is a Roman Polanski film about paranoid delusion. Or is it? A Frenchman named Trelkovsky, who is portrayed by Polanski himself, rents an apartment in which a young woman recently committed suicide. After moving in, Trelkovsky begins to believe that the neighbors in the complex conspired to torment the women until she committed suicide. He soon realizes he may be the next target. Is Trelkovsky gradually being driven mad by his mysteriously hostile neighbors or is he being pursued by the spirit of the dead woman? Is the bone left behind by the woman hidden in a hole in the wall some type of fetish? As Trelkovsky slowly takes on the characteristics of the dead woman, the mystery deepens. This film was the official French entry at Cannes in 1976.  It is considered the last of Polanski's apartment trilogy, following Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. Roger Ebert says ""The Tenant's not merely bad -- it's an embarrassment."" Other reviewers disagree and feel that ""The Tenant is one of Roman Polanski's greatest and darkest films."" It has become a cult favorite and is perhaps best known for its director dressing as a woman. Polanski won a Best Director Oscar for the film The Pianist, which also won best picture. He has been nominated for Oscars for the films Tess, Chinatown, and Rosemary's Baby. If you like Polanski, you will like this movie.

707781,A2HII4U9WQ0XUV,B000069I09,"Dark Mechanicus JSG ""Black Ops Teep""","[8, 10]","Roman Polanski stars and directs in this vicious, haunting little conte-cruelle set in Paris, in which a hapless, mild-mannered Parisian bureaucrat M. Trelkovsky (Polanski, channeling up Dustin Hoffman) rents an apartment whose previous tenant flung herself to her death from the bedroom window, and who now lingers comatose in the hospital, minutes from death. Trelkovsky negotiates a deal with merciless landlord Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas looming like an ancient human stormcloud), predicates it on the death of the hapless former tenant Simone Choule, and moves in on the news that the woman is dead and cold. Freakiness ensues.Warning: this movie is vintage Polanski, very textured, very detailed, very meticulous, exceptionally deranged and disturbing---but not for the impatient. For best results, wait for an overcast day with the wind roaring in the trees and the rain pattering against the window, get a fire roaring in the hearth, drink some well-aged Scotch, and sit back and truly ensconce yourself in the weirdness.""The Tenant"" is a waking nightmare in which you can't help but feel pity---and unfolding horror---for the dreamer.Every one of us, I think, has had an experience with a nightmare landlord. When I was a feckless undergraduate, I rented an apartment from a miserly but prominent lawyer, a wretched creature straight from Dickens who materialized on my doorstep at 2 in the morning hours after I had called to warn him of my pipes bursting. The man was about 150 years old, full of scowling fury, and cursed at me to get a bucket as I was a ""useless, philandering young fool"" and had destroyed his apartment---despite the fact that the pipes were later found to have been indifferently maintained for decades.The simple question at the dark heart of ""The Tenant"" is this: at what point are we ourselves? How much of ourselves must we sacrifice---at work, at play, in our daily lives---to live in society? At what point to we cease to be? Trelkovsky, eager to please, diffident in all aspects of his life and his civil-service job, anxious to avoid offense, lounges drunk on the bed of his lover (the astonishing Isabelle Adjani, here hopelessly gorgeous) and wonders by what right he considers himself---his being, his soul, his identity---to reside in his head. Why not the nose? The body? The arm? Or perhaps the tooth, one of which he finds concealed in a hole drilled into the apartment wall, swathed in a cotton ball, hidden behind the heavy wardrobe of the apartment's doomed former tenant.Worse still, poor Trelkovsky suffers the renter's worst nightmare: he doesn't even have a toilet in his apartment, and has to make a sojourn through ill-lit, peeling hallways to go to the bathroom.Director Polanski is note-perfect as the meek and meticulous Trelkovsky, eager to please, anxious to avoid offense. And equally note-perfect is Polanski's meticulous attention to detail in the atmosphere of malice: a harmless, noisy house-warming party brings the wicked attention of his draconian neighbors upon him, earns him the disdain of the matronly concierge (Shelley Winters, who shuffles and ambles and grumbles with lugubrious alacrity), and merits a nasty warning from his landlord. Worse follows his refusal to sign a petition against a supposedly ""noisy"" neighbor, and Trelkovsky finds himself constantly warned against making too much noise, consequently relegated to scuttling quietly about like a mouse in his own apartment.""The Tenant"" is an invitation to follow Trelkovsky into a cycle the hapless renter should be familiar with: righteous indignation, an eagerness to please and forge allies, and ultimately a descent into obesssion and madness. Why does the local cafe insist on serving Trelkovsky hot chocolate and Marlboro smokes, both favored by his suicidal predecessor? What is the meaning of the late-night tenants who stand for hours in the communal restroom, looking for all the world like 16th century Russian Icons, standing like friezes, not moving a muscle? And why does Trelkovsky wake from tortured dreams to find himself cloaked in Simone's nightgown, his fingernails painted, his face rouged?The transfer on this skeletal DVD is gorgeous---the film looks like it could have been shot yesterday---though there are certainly problems, not least of which is the paucity of features on this otherwise crazily intriguing, often baffling little sliver of cinematic grue. Polanski, already in the throes of legal difficulties over his alleged pedophilia in the United States, had fled to France, and the film was shot in French as ""Le Locataire"". Alas, the only DVD you can find of this brutal little gem is dubbed atrociously in English. Polanski, Douglas, and Winters all speak their lines in English, but it's jarring to hear French gens-d'armes barking out Brooklyn-esque brogues, and it takes you completely out of the movie to hear a clearly French waiter's request voiced like an Imperial Stormtrooper from ""Star Wars"".But these are minor quibbles, and the character of Monsieur Trelkovsky is without question goes down in a fearsome triumvirate of disturbing cinematic cross-dressers, ranked with Norman Bates and Buffalo Bill. For the patient, ""The Tenant"" is a study of cold, congealed horror, and well worth the price of rent.",4,And you thought *your* Landlord was rough!,1098662400,"10 25, 2004",2004,5286,"['Roman',

He learns the former tenant before him had committed suicide.  A dress of the former tenant is left behind, and for some reason, not explained in the film, Polanski keeps the dress throughout the entire movie.

Each winds up complimenting the other in one way or another.Unfortunately, I have to concur with the reviewer below in that the movie *does* drag on too much - which is the only reason I knocked off a star.  Perhaps the script could have been really tightened up but, hey, hindsight is always 20/20 and we (the viewing public) always think we can do a better job than the director.Normally, directors aren't very good actors (Ron Howard's success is the golden exception) but Roman played the perfect role in Trelkovsky, a loner bachelor who takes a Paris flat in an apartment with a recent tragedy in a building full of eccentrics (to say the least!).The one aspect of Roman Polanski's film-making that always draws me to his films is the fact that he doesn't explain things.  He is the modern-day film-making school's nightmare in that good doesn't always win out over evil in the end nor does he tie loose ends up just to give people a happy, comfortable and satisfying feeling.  He gives the viewer a healthy dose of reality because life isn't about the fictional Hollywood endings of good over evil and everything turning out peaches and cream in the end.The ending of the film gave me a clearer idea of the meaning behind author Roland Topor's conclusion to the book (which *really* leaves you scratching your head saying, ""What the...?"").Though this is not one of my favorite Roman Polanski films, it's interesting, nonetheless, and is a great compendium to the book.  - Donna Di Giacomo",4,The movie helped fill in the blanks about some mysteries from the book,1155859200,"08 18, 2006",2006,1678,"['was', 'case', 'Roman', 'adaptation', 'Rosemary', 'Baby', 'can', 'read', 'book', 'Tenant', 'Roland', 'Topor', 'watch', 'movie', 'see', 'very', 'little', 'difference', 'two', 'up', 'complimenting', 'other', 'one', 'way', 'another.Unfortunately', 'have', 'concur', 'reviewer', 'movie', '*does*', 'drag', 'too', 'much', 'only', 'reason', 'knocked', 'off', 'star', 'Perhaps', 'script', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'tightened', 'up', 'hey', 'hindsight', 'always', '20/20', 'viewing', 'public', 'always', 'think', 'can', 'do', 'better', 'job', 'director.Normally', 'directors', 'are', ""n't"", 'very', 'good', 'actors', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'success', 'golden', 'exception', 'Roman', 'played', 'perfect', 'role', 'Trelkovsky', 'loner', 'bachelor', 'who', 'Paris', 'flat', 'apartment', 'recent', 'tragedy', 'building', 'full', 'eccentrics', 'say', 'least', '.The', 'one', 'aspect', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'film-making', 'always', 'films', 'fact', ""n't"", 'explain', 'things', 'modern-day', 'film-making', 'school', 'nightmare', 'good', ""n't"", 'always', 'win', 'out', 'evil', 'end', 'tie', 'loose', 'up', 'just', 'give', 'people', 'happy', 'comfortable', 'satisfying', 'feeling', 'viewer', 'healthy', 'dose', 'reality', 'life', ""n't"", 'fictional', 'Hollywood', 'endings', 'good', 'evil', 'everything', 'turning', 'out', 'peaches', 'cream', 'end.The', 'ending', 'film', 'gave', 'clearer', 'idea', 'meaning', 'author', 'Roland', 'Topor', 'conclusion', 'book', '*really*', 'scratching', 'head', 'saying', 'What', 'not', 'one', 'favorite', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'films', 'interesting', 'nonetheless', 'great', 'compendium', 'book', 'Donna', 'Di', 'Giacomo']",The Tenant

Finally one night I put it in after getting tired of watching predictable movies and got to see one of Polanski's finest attempts at making an original mystery come to life.  All I knew is that it was going to be a &quot;psychological thriller&quot; and that he had just made CHINATOWN a year before.  I was amazed to see what he had accomplished with this story.  Polanski stars in it as a new tenant who moves into an apartment building with some of the weirdest and most intriguing characters I've seen in cinema.  Great acting from all of them; it makes me convinced that these people exist somewhere, if not right next to me.  Polanski's talent at slowly bringing in audiences to a story is certainly impressive.  Once the audience is in, the film twists completely and it becomes a roller coaster racing all over the place.  We are desperately trying to hold on as he takes us on a journey on how he is seeing these people through his mind.  With Isabelle Adjanti acting out a strange role other than her &quot;sad and beautiful&quot; typical characters, I found myself appreciating her acting more than ever.  The imagery in this film is some of the best I've seen, and the music makes it a work of art.  There were times where I would play a scene over and over again because of the mix of music and visuals.  When the film is over, it made me want to see it again because as usual, Polanski leaves the audience with letting US decide what really happened.

They can also be used to describe the residents of the Parisian apartment building into which Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) moves.  The former resident, Simone, leaped from the window and laid, wrapped like a mummy, in the hospital before dying.  Soon, Trelkovsky believes that there is a conspiracy among the neighbors to force him to also commit suicide  Does this diabolical conspiracy exist only in his insane imagination or is it real?  The viewer never knows for sure and this makes the film highly provocative.Having watched Polanski's occult masterpiece, ""Rosemary's Baby,"" I can't help but believe that Trelkovsky is part of a complex Satanic conspiracy.  The neighbors are Satan worshippers who have conspired to drive him insane and force him to commit suicide as a type of human sacrifice.  They treat him as though he is Simone, giving him her mail and serving him her hot chocolate and Marlboros.  He receives her photograph of the Egyptian sarcophagus from the Louvre.  Next, he sees Egyptian hieroglyphics on the wall of the communal bathroom - the wall upon which residents have been seen staring as though entranced.  There is also the human tooth embedded in his apartment wall.  Simone's tooth?  It would imply that part of her lives on in the apartment, preserved like a mummy, for eternity.  Perhaps it is her soul, or ghost, that compels him to wear her clothes and put on a wig.Commentary from Roman Polanski, explaining the mystery behind the apartment building and its residents, would've been nice.

God knows why, but it sets up the framework for a really believable, chilling descent into madness.Tarkovsky is consistently abused, harassed, and put down by both the absurdly stingy landlord (a hideous old man) and his neighbors.  Not only that, it seems that everyone (or is this just his imagination?) sees striking similarities between him and the woman who jumped from the apartment room he is living in.There are memorable scenes in which he is frantically offered her brand of cigarettes, coffee, etc. Perhaps Polanski wants us to see in Tarkovsky the male echo of the former tenant; perhaps the movie is a reminder of the power of suggestion.  At any rate, it doesn't take long for Tarkovsky to reach breaking point.Crossdressing (and having an utterly pointless, unbelievable affair with the woman's friend--someone was looped behind the camera), he hallucinates her figure in the apartments across from the building. He finds (or does he?) teeth in the walls, and an array of dresses he is quick to try on. His behavior becomes more and more irrational.  He slaps a child who has a slit in his teeth resembling the woman, he asks to buy a gun at a bar, and at long last withdraws from his obnoxious and ridiculously 'American' friends into a world all his own.  The ending is both predictable and unpredictable, and sometimes strikes one as funny, sometimes as awful.What I don't understand is why more people aren't aware of this film, as it definitely one of the most powerful pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen.

This movie is bizzare, I didn't really know what to expect from the description of the movie which said the movie was basically about a guy that rents an apartment where the previous occupant commited suicide.The main thing that drew me to this movie was that it was directed and starred Roman Polanski, who I've always heard good things about, (except for that pedophile incident he had, that's very bad). He plays a man who tries to be good and never means harm to anyone but his world turns upside down as soon as he gets hassled by his annoying neighbors. Later on he'll be lost in his mind, not knowing who to trust, except for his love interest, the friend of the girl that commited suicide which he meets at the hospital. Story, which is based on some novel, is great because it tells you about the tragedy of a man falling victim to an unfair world. You really see and feel how insane he goes with the good story pacing.

He meets her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani) and finds himself unwittingly in the unfortunate girl's footsteps. Her brand of cigarettes, her favorite chocolate drink, her clothes and even her tooth (stuck in a hole in the wall) haunt him. No one seems to understand his concerns...least of all the difficult and bizarre tenants he's surrounded by who complain of his every move. He comes to believe it's a plot to drive him to suicide...like Simone. Roman Polanski (who co-wrote and also directed) is brilliant as Trelkovsky, the quiet tenant who's plunged into a nightmare that may or not be real. He's believable as an Everyman who suddenly finds himself alienated and in the grips of something he can't control. Is he going mad? Or is it...something else? Shelley Winters (as the concierge), Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet and Lila Kedrova as the other tenants contribute their considerable panache---making Trelkovsky's paranoic nightmare world even more sinister.  A fascinating and haunting psychological journey that keeps you intrigued (and disturbed) right up until the final, bone-chilling scream.

The film is tragically funny and creepy. Polanski's use of space in the apartment and the dark lighting invokes a creepy atmosphere.The film follows a timid file clerk named Trelkovsky--played brilliantly by Roman Polanski himself--who moves into an apartment whose previous tenant, a woman named Simone, attempted suicide by jumping out of the window. He is informed by the landlord that he can rent the apartment only if Simone dies. With the hopes of her death, Trelkovsky visits her in the hospital by pretending and lying to the nurse that he is a friend. He meets Estella (Esabelle Adjani), a real friend visiting, next to Simone's bed. When he witnesses Simone lying on the bed wrapped with white bandages from head to toe like a mummy, Simone unloads a haunting scream--as if she is vengefully passing her curse to Trelkovsky. Her scream would echoe and follow Trelkovsky when he immediately leaves the hospital with Estella. After hearing of her death, Trelkovsky celebratingly moves into the apartment where his paranoia and downfall begins.This film is one of my all-time favorites because it belongs in that &quot;man in his room&quot; category. There are only a few films out there like it. I think I can only name a few such as Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, Vampire's Kiss, Love Object, or the French film, I Stand Alone. What I mean by &quot;man in his room&quot; is existential loneliness like the protagonist in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea. The person is isolated in his space and is left with only to reflect or create his own world. In Trelkovsky's case, he creates a world of conspiracy in which the other tenants in the apartment are trying to make him commit suicide. And what happens with Trelkovsky's delusion is ultimately a funny but tragic climax.The first time I saw this film, I thought it was creepy and dark. But the more times I watched it even though it is still creepy and dark, I begin to realized more and more about Polanski's humorous intent. The tragic ending is just undeniably hilarious. I just start laughing out of control.Roman Polanski is one of my favorite filmmakers and The Tenant is his best. It is very fortunate that he played the protagonist in the film. The Tenant is truly a Polanski tour-de-force. The Tenant's score, which I really love, is simultaneosly hypnotic and tragic.

707802,A2M1N8G4W4END8,B000069I09,Michael R Gates,"[5, 8]","&quot;No One Does It to You like Roman Polanski,&quot; sure.  But how one is likely to interpret that tagline from Polanski's 1976 film THE TENANT (a.k.a LE LOCATAIRE) depends on which Polanski film is being considered.  If referring to Polanski's 1968 masterpiece ROSEMARY'S BABY, it is easy to assume that the advertisers mean to say that no one SCARES you or DISTURBS you like Polanski.  On the other hand, when regarding THE TENANT, it is tempting to assume that the ad-men might have been using a slang-related double entendre.  Because even though THE TENANT is well acted--Polanski, in the titular role, delivers what is arguably his best acting performance--and despite the fact that the ambiguous plot is both creepy and engaging, the film's conclusion is wholly dissatisfying and anti-climactic.  The questions that Polanski thrusts into the audience's face throughout the movie are left unanswered at the end, and while that vagueness works for the plots of some films, it utterly fails in THE TENANT.  One is left with the feeling that Polanski has behaved like a cinematic bully, taunting the audience with esoteric events and thereby forcing them beg for ultimate clarity, but then pushing them aside at the film's end and exiting the playground without delivering what was tacitly promised.THE TENANT is a filmic exercise in existentialist paranoia. It begins with the eponymous character, Trelkovsky (Polanski), attempting to rent a Paris apartment that he has heard is now vacant.  As he previews the flat and negotiates rent, he gets snippets of information about the former tenant--a girl who committed suicide by flinging herself out the apartment's only window.  As the film progresses, Trelkovsky learns more and more about his predecessor, and the more he learns, the more obsessed he becomes with the details of her life.  And this obsession eventually leads to Trelkovsky's undoing.Casual Polanski fans who are expecting THE TENANT to be another CHINATOWN (1974), ROSEMARY'S BABY, or even THE PIANIST (2002) will be sorely disappointed.  Horror fans remembering ROSEMARY'S BABY will enjoy the film's distortion of reality and creepy ambiguity but will likely be disappointed with the conclusion...or lack thereof.  On the other hand, hardcore Polanski aficionados will probably love it from opening scene all the way to closing credits.As mentioned before, the mostly top-notch acting in THE TENANT is its true redeeming quality.  Polanski is very effective at depicting the mental deterioration of the title character, Trelkovsky, and gorgeous French actress Isabelle Adjani is compellingly bizarre as Stella, Trelkovsky's occasional love--or is it lust?--interest.  Veteran American actor Melvyn Douglas delivers a delightful performance as the landlord, and it's fun to see American actress Shelly Winters in a cameo role as the concierge of the apartment complex.As is the norm for many Paramount DVDs, the only real bonus item is the film's theatrical trailer.  However, the clear, visually rich widescreen digital transfer indicates that the creation of the disc involved a quality print.In short, the DVD is well worth the cost for students of cinema and hardcore fans of Polanski.  Those who watch films solely for the enjoyment of good acting may also feel the disc will make a worthy addition to their film collections, but most casual filmgoers will probably be irked by the film's ending and are therefore advised to look elsewhere for movie entertainment.",3,&quot;No One Does It to You like Roman Polanski&quot;,1077148800,"02 19, 2004",2004,3493,"['quot', 'One', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'quot', 'sure', 'how', 'one', 'likely', 'interpret', 'tagline', 'Polanski', '1976', 'film', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'a.k.a', 'LE', 'LOCATAIRE', 'Polanski', 'film', 'being', 'considered', 'referring', 'Polanski', '1968', 'masterpiece', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'easy', 'assume', 'advertisers', 'mean', 'say', 'one', 'SCARES', 'DISTURBS', 'Polanski', 'other', 'hand', 'when', 'regarding', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'tempting', 'assume', 'ad-men', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'using', 'slang-related', 'double', 'entendre', 'even', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'well', 'acted', 'Polanski', 'titular', 'role', 'delivers', 'what', 'arguably', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'fact', 'ambiguous', 'plot', 'creepy', 'engaging', 'film', 'conclusion', 'wholly', 'dissatisfying', 'anti-climactic', 'questions', 'Polanski', 'audience', 'face', 'movie', 'are', 'left', 'unanswered', 'end', 'vagueness', 'plots', 'films', 'utterly', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'One', 'left', 'feeling', 'Polanski', 'behaved', 'cinematic', 'bully', 'taunting', 'audience', 'esoteric', 'events', 'thereby', 'forcing', 'beg', 'ultimate', 'clarity', 'then', 'pushing', 'aside', 'film', 'end', 'exiting', 'playground', 'delivering', 'what', 'was', 'tacitly', 'promised.THE', 'TENANT', 'filmic', 'exercise', 'existentialist', 'paranoia', 'eponymous', 'character', 'Trelkovsky', 'Polanski', 'attempting', 'rent', 'Paris', 'apartment', 'heard', 'now', 'vacant', 'flat', 'negotiates', 'rent', 'snippets', 'information', 'former', 'tenant', 'girl', 'who', 'committed', 'suicide', 'flinging', 'apartment', 'only', 'window', 'film', 'Trelkovsky', 'more', 'more', 'predecessor', 'more', 'more', 'obsessed', 'details', 'life', 'obsession', 'eventually', 'Trelkovsky', 'undoing.Casual', 'Polanski', 'fans', 'who', 'are', 'expecting', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'be', 'CHINATOWN', '1974', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'even', 'PIANIST', '2002', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'Horror', 'fans', 'remembering', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'will', 'enjoy', 'film', 'distortion', 'reality', 'creepy', 'ambiguity', 'will', 'likely', 'be', 'disappointed', 'conclusion', 'lack', 'thereof', 'other', 'hand', 'hardcore', 'Polanski', 'aficionados', 'will', 'probably', 'love', 'opening', 'scene', 'way', 'closing', 'credits.As', 'mentioned', 'before', 'mostly', 'top-notch', 'acting', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'true', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'Polanski', 'very', 'effective', 'depicting', 'mental', 'deterioration', 'title', 'character', 'Trelkovsky', 'gorgeous', 'French', 'actress', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'compellingly', 'bizarre', 'Stella', 'Trelkovsky', 'occasional', 'love', 'lust', 'interest', 'Veteran', 'American', 'actor', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'delightful', 'performance', 'landlord', 'fun', 'see', 'American', 'actress', 'Shelly', 'Winters', 'cameo', 'role', 'concierge', 'apartment', 'complex.As', 'norm', 'many', 'Paramount', 'DVDs', 'only', 'real', 'bonus', 'item', 'film', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'However', 'clear', 'visually', 'rich', 'widescreen', 'digital', 'transfer', 'creation', 'disc', 'involved', 'quality', 'print.In', 'short', 'DVD', 'well', 'cost', 'students', 'cinema', 'hardcore', 'fans', 'Polanski', 'who', 'watch', 'films', 'solely', 'enjoyment', 'good', 'acting', 'may', 'also', 'feel', 'disc', 'will', 'make', 'worthy', 'addition', 'film', 'collections', 'most', 'casual', 'filmgoers', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'irked', 'film', 'ending', 'are', 'therefore', 'advised', 'look', 'elsewhere', 'movie', 'entertainment']",The Tenant
707803,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B000069I09,mirasreviews,"[3, 10]","Roman Polanski and Gerard Brach, the screenwriting team behind Polanski's 1965 apartment house horror film ""Repulsion"", had less success in adapting Roland Topor's novel ""Le locataire chim&eacute;rique"" for the screen. It's difficult to say if ""The Tenant"" is trying to be a suspense or an absurdist parody of a suspense, but it hardly matters, as the film is neither scary nor funny. I can say with certainty is that it is too long. It feels like the story has been forcibly stretched. Ironically, the premise is essentially the same as in ""Repulsion"": A tenant descends into schizophrenic madness amid odd neighbors and eerie production design, alone in his apartment.A Parisian bachelor named Mr. Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) takes a dingy 2-room apartment in an old building, whose crotchety concierge (Shelley Winters) explains, ""The previous tenant threw herself out of the window."" His visits that former tenant, Simone, in the hospital, where he meets her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani). But Trelkovsky, surrounded by Simone's belongings, can't get her suicide out of his mind. He sees people standing for hours in the toilet opposite his apartment. He is exasperated by the accusations of the building owner and the intrigues of his neighbors. Even Stella's kindness can't dispel his mounting paranoia.The only good thing I can say about ""The Tenant"" is that Polanski's Trelkovsky seems authentically unassuming up to a point: He's genuinely pleased to find an apartment, embarrassed by his annoying co-workers, and really trying to be a nice guy. But nothing is interesting beyond that. His hallucinations and obsessions are more comic than frightening, but not enough to be entertaining, and his suffering inspires no empathy.

707804,A3IMNZSYDOTTU6,B000069I09,"M. Jarrett ""SoundgardenFanForLife""","[3, 4]","Roman Polanski's REPULSION was a terrifying descent into the world of isolation and complete madness. ROSEMARY'S BABY was a tale of child birth gone satanic with a delusional edge. THE TENANT is one of those psychological thrillers you have to pay close attention to in order to understand and fully grasp the concept of paranoia. It's one of the finest thrillers since Hitchcock's masterful PSYCHO. But THE TENANT is an altogether different experience.We meet a working class man named Trevoltsky (played by Polanski himself) who is working in Paris and trying to find a new Apartment. We learn in the beginning that the place he's interested in once belonged to a woman by the name of Simone, a woman who was driven to suicide without specific explanation. After Trevoltsky manages to whisk the apartment away and move in, he goes to the hospital to meet Simone, who is in a complete bodycast and has suffered serious injury from her attempt at an end. There, Trevoltsky meets Stella, a young woman who he seems entranced with and is a friend of Simone's. They meet for drinks and go to see a movie, where they end up getting rather hot for each other but must reserve themselves after a few glances from an onlooker. They part ways and Trevoltsky goes off himself.From there, we watch as the new neighbors of Trevoltsky become irritated with his late night antics and strange manner, and many strange things begin to happen that make Trevoltsky suspect there is something more going on then he's been thinking. For instance, when Trevoltsky discovers a tooth in his wall that was hidden, his reaction is the same as when we see him viewing it, like ""where the hell did this come from?"" And another instance is when Trevoltsky returns from a late night out with Stella, the landlord demands an explanation for Trevoltsky's actions with a woman that night in his apartment. But Trevoltsky explains he wasn't even there, and the descent into paranoia starts to sink in. Trevoltsky begins to suspect there's a plot against him from the neighbors and tries to let Stella in on this susposed devious madness. But even later in the movie Trevoltsky begins to suspect that even Stella is in on the whole deal with the neighbors and his paranoia starts to stir like crazy. By the time of the movie's climax, we see Trevoltsky has gone completely mad and is dressed like a woman and ends up attempting his suicide twice in the same instance, all the while delusions of the neighbors trying to aide in his demise torment him. He ends up in a body cast much like Simone and his fate is thus sealed.THE TENANT is one of those thrillers where repeated viewings will get you to appreciate what Polanski has done here. What's he's created turns out to be a fine thriller in the vein of PSYCHO and REPULSION, and his exploration into the world of paranoia and delusions further cements his status as one of the great thriller directors of our generation. THE TENANT remains a fine suspense thriller that will make you think whether the next neighbors you have will leave you guessing at every turn.",5,One of Roman Polanski's Finest Moments...'Tenant' Strange and Suspenseful...,1171238400,"02 12, 2007",2007,3084,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 'REPULSION', 'was', 'terrifying', 'descent', 'world', 'isolation', 'complete', 'madness', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'was', 'tale', 'child', 'birth', 'gone', 'satanic', 'delusional', 'edge', 'TENANT', 'one', 'psychological', 'thrillers', 'have', 'pay', 'close', 'attention', 'order', 'understand', 'fully', 'grasp', 'concept', 'paranoia', 'one', 'finest', 'thrillers', 'Hitchcock', 'masterful', 'PSYCHO', 'THE', 'TENANT', 'altogether', 'different', 'experience.We', 'meet', 'working', 'class', 'man', 'named', 'Trevoltsky', 'played', 'Polanski', 'who', 'working', 'Paris', 'trying', 'find', 'new', 'Apartment', 'learn', 'beginning', 'place', 'interested', 'once', 'belonged', 'woman', 'name', 'Simone', 'woman', 'who', 'was', 'driven', 'suicide', 'specific', 'explanation', 'Trevoltsky', 'whisk', 'apartment', 'away', 'move', 'hospital', 'meet', 'Simone', 'who', 'complete', 'bodycast', 'suffered', 'serious', 'injury', 'attempt', 'end', 'Trevoltsky', 'Stella', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'entranced', 'friend', 'Simone', 'meet', 'drinks', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'where', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'rather', 'hot', 'other', 'must', 'reserve', 'few', 'glances', 'onlooker', 'part', 'ways', 'Trevoltsky', 'off', 'himself.From', 'there', 'watch', 'new', 'neighbors', 'Trevoltsky', 'become', 'irritated', 'late', 'night', 'antics', 'strange', 'manner', 'many', 'strange', 'things', 'begin', 'happen', 'make', 'Trevoltsky', 'suspect', 'something', 'more', 'going', 'then', 'been', 'thinking', 'instance', 'when', 'Trevoltsky', 'tooth', 'wall', 'was', 'hidden', 'reaction', 'same', 'when', 'see', 'viewing', 'where', 'hell', 'did', 'come', 'instance', 'when', 'Trevoltsky', 'late', 'night', 'out', 'Stella', 'landlord', 'explanation', 'Trevoltsky', 'actions', 'woman', 'night', 'apartment', 'Trevoltsky', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'there', 'descent', 'paranoia', 'sink', 'Trevoltsky', 'suspect', 'plot', 'neighbors', 'tries', 'let', 'Stella', 'susposed', 'devious', 'madness', 'even', 'later', 'movie', 'Trevoltsky', 'suspect', 'even', 'Stella', 'whole', 'deal', 'neighbors', 'paranoia', 'stir', 'crazy', 'time', 'movie', 'climax', 'see', 'Trevoltsky', 'gone', 'completely', 'mad', 'dressed', 'woman', 'up', 'attempting', 'suicide', 'twice', 'same', 'instance', 'while', 'delusions', 'neighbors', 'trying', 'aide', 'demise', 'torment', 'up', 'body', 'cast', 'much', 'Simone', 'fate', 'thus', 'sealed.THE', 'TENANT', 'one', 'thrillers', 'where', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'will', 'get', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Polanski', 'done', 'here', 'What', 'created', 'out', 'be', 'fine', 'thriller', 'vein', 'PSYCHO', 'REPULSION', 'exploration', 'world', 'paranoia', 'delusions', 'further', 'cements', 'status', 'one', 'great', 'thriller', 'directors', 'generation', 'TENANT', 'fine', 'suspense', 'thriller', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'next', 'neighbors', 'have', 'will', 'leave', 'guessing', 'turn']",The Tenant

Two - having seen this once on VHS, I thought just for the hell of it I would try watching the French dub on the off chance that it would be the one made for the French first-run release. It is, and let me tell you, folks - the social humor that comes off as rather heavy-handed in the English version becomes subtle, muted and sardonic. The regional Parisian colloquialisms immeasurably enhance the film's atmosphere and authenticity. Sure, there are American actors in the film, we don't get to hear their voices, but that's all right as Polanski gives a fine rendition of his role in French and the actors dubbing the rest of the cast acquit themselves extraordinarily well. I am nominally a purist about foreign language dubs as a rule - meaning I don't watch them as they generally vitiate the unique character of a film. However, &quot;The Tenant&quot; is a French film in all but the particulars of its completion and release for American audiences. It used a French studio, French actors and technicians, and is thusly as sharp an evocation of the damp, mouldy side of Paris as has ever been seen in pictures. For these reasons, the French dub seems to me to improve on the original - superb as that track is, don't get me wrong.

707808,A1PL8JA0TEHBVN,B000069I09,Paulo Leite,"[42, 48]","In CHINATOWN, Polanski gave us a great story of corruption. In ROSEMARY'S BABY, he studied the occult. In REPULSION, he gave us a portrait of a troubled mind. Here, in THE TENANT, Roman Polanski gives us a stunning new portrayal of absolute paranoia.Polanski stars himself as the main character: a man who rents the apartment of a dead woman - who apparently jumped from her window.Strangely enough, Polanski's character starts to identify with the dead woman little by little as he starts to live in the same environment... the same apartment, the same neighbours, the same window, the same talk... and - guess what! - maybe she did not commit suicide after all...But this is just the beginning. To reveal more, it would be unthinkable.Why is this a great film? A first rate screenplay (beautifully constructed), amazing actors (Shelley Winters and Melvyn Douglas are great!), and......The sets! The bulding (a parisian quartier) is absolutely fantastic. Like REAR WINDOW, it was entirely built in a sound stage - incredible!!! - allowing Mr.Polanski enough freedom to put the camera wherever he wanted.But the great thing about this film is that (like in a state of paranoia) you never know what is truth or what is imagined. The main character starts to see, hear and discover things that may actually be true! - only at the end (with a finalle that makes perfect sense) you'll discover the truth behind it all.After those beautiful sets, comes the cinematography by one of the top Directors of Photography: Sven Nykvist (PERSONA, CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, ANOTHER WOMAN, CRIES AND WHISPERS, AUTUMN SONATA, and many other works)... this film has one of the best studio cinematographies I have ever seen. The music is also beautiful and you will love it from the moment it begins. Also a great achevement is sound design.This is one of those great films where mood and atmosphere set an exemple for what to do in a film - a work where everything is right.Unfortunately, the DVD only comes with the trailer (which is also beautiful). No photos, no commentary (I was hoping this DVD would come with a commentary by Mr.Polanski), not even a small interview with anybody.

707809,A1H6IVVF68QYC7,B000069I09,prospero72,"[0, 0]","REVIEW: ""There's something going on in my building."" declares our protagonist, Trelkovsky, to his friends over dinner one night: and so begins his long, slow descent into fear and paranoia in Roman Polanski's dark, disturbing thriller ""THE TENANT"". This is the third (and weakest) entry in the director's so-called ""apartment house trilogy"" (preceeded by the classic ""REPULSION"", and the sinister evil of ""ROSEMARY'S BABY""). It stars Polanski himself (a canny move) as a quiet, somewhat put-upon fellow who is ecstatic to find an apartment for let in Paris that has just come open due to the previous tenant's suicide. From this sombre beginning the film becomes increasingly more and more bizarre: as the audience is never quite sure if Polanski's character is really in danger from the other neighbors (who may or may not have conspired to kill that former tenant), or whether someone is trying to drive him crazy, or whether he is having a complete mental breakdown. I won't give away the ending: but safe to say that the tremendous buildup turns out to be a bit of a let down (and that much of what went on before is left unexplained). Repeated viewings of the film helps to alleviate the initial sense of disappointment (while teasing its audience to try and figure out just what the heck is going on with this story). Of course, anything by Polanski is always worth watching, but the screenplays to ""REPULSION"" and ""ROSEMARY'S BABY"" were far more clearly defined nightmares (one internal, one external) of urban life. ""THE TENANT"" tries to have it both ways: as a psychological horror story and as a real-life horror story. Yet it falters a bit on both accounts despite the excellent performances, and the beautiful camera work by legendary cinematographer Sven Nykvist.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE MOVIE: if you haven't yet seen the film then I would suggest you stop reading this review as I am going to reveal the ending to it. The whole gist of Trelkovsky's eventual descent into madness can also be analyzed from a spiritual point-of-view. As we see the poor guy becoming more and more unhinged it is certainly arguable that he is undergoing demonic possession: to the point of dressing like the dead woman who previously rented the apartment, speaking in her voice, and seeing all sorts of evil hallucinations. There are a couple of scenes I can refer to in order to back up this hypothesis: the earlier one inside a church where he attends Simone's funeral and has a panic attack (with the sermon by the priest gradually turning into a sadistic, mocking liturgy in which Trelkovsky ""hears"" him say such stuff as ""Christ ascended into Heaven and have joined the hosts of angels on high: but not for creeps like you"" and ""What are you doing here in my temple? The graveyard is where you belong! Thou shalt stink! Thou shalt stink like some putrified corpse lying along the wayside! Verily, I say unto thee: thou shalt never enter into my kingdom.""), and the gory finale where he is confronted by concerned neighbors but ""sees"" them morphing into forked-tongued snakes and demonic-looking monsters. The idea of the Devil exploiting Trelkovsky's own fears and weaknesses, and the final overtaking of his mind by evil forces may be a frightening way to view ""THE TENANT"", but it will certainly add to the discussion of the ordeal Polanski puts his audience through. Either way it is a terribly sad, terribly creepy, and terribly depressing motion picture.",4,THE TENANT (PARAMOUNT PICTURES/1976),1142467200,"03 16, 2006",2006,3470,"['REVIEW', 'something', 'going', 'building', 'protagonist', 'Trelkovsky', 'friends', 'dinner', 'one', 'night', 'so', 'long', 'slow', 'descent', 'fear', 'paranoia', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'dark', 'disturbing', 'thriller', 'TENANT', 'third', 'weakest', 'entry', 'director', 'so-called', 'apartment', 'house', 'trilogy', 'preceeded', 'classic', 'REPULSION', 'sinister', 'evil', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'Polanski', 'canny', 'move', 'quiet', 'somewhat', 'put-upon', 'fellow', 'who', 'ecstatic', 'find', 'apartment', 'let', 'Paris', 'just', 'come', 'open', 'due', 'previous', 'tenant', 'suicide', 'sombre', 'beginning', 'film', 'increasingly', 'more', 'more', 'bizarre', 'audience', 'never', 'quite', 'sure', 'Polanski', 'character', 'really', 'danger', 'other', 'neighbors', 'who', 'may', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'conspired', 'kill', 'former', 'tenant', 'someone', 'trying', 'drive', 'crazy', 'having', 'complete', 'mental', 'breakdown', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'away', 'ending', 'safe', 'say', 'tremendous', 'buildup', 'out', 'be', 'bit', 'let', 'down', 'much', 'what', 'went', 'before', 'left', 'unexplained', 'Repeated', 'viewings', 'film', 'alleviate', 'initial', 'sense', 'disappointment', 'teasing', 'audience', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'heck', 'going', 'story', 'course', 'anything', 'Polanski', 'always', 'worth', 'watching', 'screenplays', 'REPULSION', 'ROSEMARY', 'BABY', 'were', 'far', 'more', 'clearly', 'defined', 'nightmares', 'one', 'internal', 'one', 'external', 'urban', 'life', 'TENANT', 'tries', 'have', 'ways', 'psychological', 'horror', 'story', 'real-life', 'horror', 'story', 'bit', 'accounts', 'excellent', 'performances', 'beautiful', 'camera', 'work', 'legendary', 'cinematographer', 'Sven', 'Nykvist.FOR', 'THOSE', 'WHO', 'HAVE', 'ALREADY', 'SEEN', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'have', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'then', 'would', 'suggest', 'stop', 'reading', 'review', 'am', 'going', 'reveal', 'ending', 'whole', 'gist', 'Trelkovsky', 'eventual', 'descent', 'madness', 'can', 'also', 'be', 'analyzed', 'spiritual', 'point-of-view', 'see', 'poor', 'guy', 'becoming', 'more', 'more', 'unhinged', 'certainly', 'arguable', 'undergoing', 'demonic', 'possession', 'point', 'dressing', 'dead', 'woman', 'who', 'previously', 'rented', 'apartment', 'speaking', 'voice', 'seeing', 'sorts', 'evil', 'hallucinations', 'are', 'couple', 'scenes', 'can', 'refer', 'order', 'back', 'up', 'hypothesis', 'earlier', 'one', 'church', 'where', 'Simone', 'funeral', 'panic', 'attack', 'sermon', 'priest', 'gradually', 'turning', 'sadistic', 'mocking', 'liturgy', 'Trelkovsky', 'hears', 'say', 'such', 'stuff', 'Christ', 'ascended', 'Heaven', 'have', 'joined', 'hosts', 'angels', 'high', 'not', 'creeps', 'What', 'are', 'doing', 'here', 'temple', 'graveyard', 'where', 'belong', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'stink', 'Thou', 'shalt', 'stink', 'putrified', 'corpse', 'lying', 'wayside', 'Verily', 'say', 'unto', 'thee', 'thou', 'shalt', 'never', 'enter', 'kingdom', 'gory', 'finale', 'where', 'confronted', 'concerned', 'neighbors', 'sees', 'morphing', 'forked-tongued', 'snakes', 'demonic-looking', 'monsters', 'idea', 'Devil', 'exploiting', 'Trelkovsky', 'own', 'fears', 'weaknesses', 'final', 'overtaking', 'mind', 'evil', 'forces', 'may', 'be', 'frightening', 'way', 'view', 'TENANT', 'will', 'certainly', 'add', 'discussion', 'ordeal', 'Polanski', 'audience', 'way', 'terribly', 'sad', 'terribly', 'creepy', 'terribly', 'depressing', 'motion', 'picture']",The Tenant

However, Polanski, to me, is a true genius of the modern era. Multi-talented, if he had one superior strength, it would be in his construction of the psychological drama. Like no other filmmaker, Polanski has always had the ability of placing the viewer inside the mind of the troubled soul. Although it is a place one would really never like to visit, there is something compelling about really getting inside a person's trauma and seeing it from the inside out.I feel that he has never cut quite as deeply under the skin as in one of his last masterworks, The Tenant. Anyone to read this critique can get a real breakdown of the film in any of the other 'critiques' here(as in the world of modern film 'criticism', the 'critics' on the Amazon pages are merely more of the same: simply capsule reviewers, pontificating on their so-called immensity of depth and understanding of said media). On the other hand, I would just prefer to give a critique.Sven Nykvist, The Tenant's photographer, had been shooting most of the Ingmar Bergman works since the early 60s. His attention to detail and use of different lenses aids immensely in sending this film down the corridor of madness that exists in both the aesthetic world and the psychological one of our hero. Polanski, as not just the film's director but the main character here, is a perfect fit in the 'dual' role of the lead, both insecure meek mouse and paranoiac mental case. He not only visually acts out the part(s), but characterizes his downward transition audibly, as well, through vocal intonation. Without really thinking about this, it's these sounds from his character that guide the viewer/listener through his stages of digression.Now, for anyone who has ever seen his earlier work 'Repulsion', that is one of my favorite thrillers and a work that made my top 100 list of personal favorites. This may seem quite odd considering the uncomfortable storyline to that film, but, again, I actually felt like I had gotten inside the character of Catherine Deneuve, somewhat like taking a psych course but living it at the same time. However discomforting his earlier films may be, though, The Tenant surpasses them all. In fact, this is a picture, however much I like it-and I like it quite a bit-that could never make it on my all-time favorites list, mainly due to how much more troubling it is to sit through than even most of the uncomforting works of filmdom.Filmmakers like David Lynch, Ken Russell, and John Waters come to mind. However, with these directors, the most bothersome their work becomes, it's still just a pseudo-fantasy world of surreality. Sure, possibly a bit irritating and offputting, but still just a film. In Polanski, the film is almost always a reality-and often one the viewer would just like to end. Yet, we cannot seem to turn away and stop watching-completely drawn towards the darkness, immersed in a world that at once is both shocking and repulsive as well as being exciting and engrossing. I can handle quite a bit when it comes to visual media, so long as there is some point to sustaining my attention. Here, though, although this film is not graphically violent or sexual in any manner, really, the subject matter, itself, seemed to make me dizzy with nausea. It's really hard to explain this factor except to note that this is not a film which I would go back to very often.On the other hand, it may end up becoming an annual Halloween treat for me, one that - although year by year may consistantly and obnoxiously trick me - I could keep coming back for more, like a dog returning to the master who kicks him. Being a student of film much more than just a moderate filmgoer seeking entertainment, I thrive on films such as this that can take control of every nerve-ending and twist them until one's muscles begin to stiffen. Perhaps, then, the bad dream that The Tenant embodies, however upsetting, is most impressive and worthwhile due to the attention of detail and depth and, well, the reality that it conveys. Yes, reality, for there is nothing short of this that comes off more terrifying when wishing most to wake from the nightmare.",4,Don't Watch This One Alone in Your Apartment!,1162339200,"11 1, 2006",2006,4372,"['Roman', 'Polanski', 'doubt', 'favorite', 'post-studio', 'system', 'director', 'adore', 'look', 'Jean', 'Luc', 'Godard', 'Martin', 'Ritt', 'as', 'well', 'enjoying', 'almost', 'everything', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'had', 'ever', 'made', 'yes', 'can', 'even', 'stand', 'bad', 'ones', 'However', 'Polanski', 'true', 'genius', 'modern', 'era', 'Multi-talented', 'had', 'one', 'superior', 'strength', 'would', 'be', 'construction', 'psychological', 'drama', 'other', 'filmmaker', 'Polanski', 'always', 'had', 'ability', 'placing', 'viewer', 'mind', 'troubled', 'soul', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'really', 'never', 'visit', 'something', 'compelling', 'really', 'getting', 'person', 'trauma', 'seeing', 'inside', 'out.I', 'feel', 'never', 'cut', 'quite', 'deeply', 'skin', 'one', 'last', 'masterworks', 'Tenant', 'Anyone', 'read', 'critique', 'can', 'get', 'real', 'breakdown', 'film', 'other', ""'critiques"", 'here', 'world', 'modern', 'film', ""'criticism"", ""'critics"", 'Amazon', 'pages', 'are', 'merely', 'more', 'same', 'simply', 'capsule', 'reviewers', 'pontificating', 'so-called', 'immensity', 'depth', 'understanding', 'said', 'media', 'other', 'hand', 'would', 'just', 'prefer', 'give', 'critique.Sven', 'Nykvist', 'Tenant', 'photographer', 'had', 'been', 'shooting', 'most', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'early', '60s', 'attention', 'detail', 'use', 'different', 'lenses', 'aids', 'immensely', 'sending', 'film', 'down', 'corridor', 'madness', 'aesthetic', 'world', 'psychological', 'one', 'hero', 'Polanski', 'not', 'just', 'film', 'director', 'main', 'character', 'here', 'perfect', 'fit', ""'dual"", 'role', 'lead', 'insecure', 'meek', 'mouse', 'paranoiac', 'mental', 'case', 'not', 'only', 'visually', 'out', 'part', 's', 'downward', 'transition', 'audibly', 'well', 'vocal', 'intonation', 'really', 'thinking', 'sounds', 'character', 'viewer/listener', 'stages', 'digression.Now', 'anyone', 'who', 'ever', 'seen', 'earlier', 'work', ""'Repulsion"", 'one', 'favorite', 'thrillers', 'work', 'made', 'top', '100', 'list', 'personal', 'favorites', 'may', 'seem', 'quite', 'odd', 'considering', 'uncomfortable', 'storyline', 'film', 'again', 'actually', 'felt', 'had', 'gotten', 'character', 'Catherine', 'Deneuve', 'somewhat', 'taking', 'psych', 'course', 'living', 'same', 'time', 'However', 'discomforting', 'earlier', 'films', 'may', 'be', 'Tenant', 'fact', 'picture', 'however', 'much', 'it-and', 'quite', 'bit-that', 'could', 'never', 'make', 'all-time', 'favorites', 'list', 'mainly', 'due', 'how', 'much', 'more', 'troubling', 'sit', 'even', 'most', 'uncomforting', 'works', 'filmdom.Filmmakers', 'David', 'Lynch', 'Ken', 'Russell', 'John', 'Waters', 'come', 'mind', 'However', 'directors', 'most', 'bothersome', 'work', 'becomes', 'still', 'just', 'pseudo-fantasy', 'world', 'surreality', 'Sure', 'possibly', 'bit', 'irritating', 'offputting', 'still', 'just', 'film', 'Polanski', 'film', 'almost', 'always', 'reality-and', 'often', 'one', 'viewer', 'would', 'just', 'like', 'end', 'can', 'not', 'seem', 'turn', 'away', 'stop', 'watching-completely', 'drawn', 'darkness', 'immersed', 'world', 'once', 'shocking', 'repulsive', 'as', 'well', 'being', 'exciting', 'engrossing', 'can', 'handle', 'quite', 'bit', 'when', 'visual', 'media', 'so', 'long', 'point', 'sustaining', 'attention', 'Here', 'though', 'film', 'not', 'graphically', 'violent', 'sexual', 'manner', 'really', 'subject', 'matter', 'seemed', 'make', 'dizzy', 'nausea', 'really', 'hard', 'explain', 'factor', 'note', 'not', 'film', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'very', 'often.On', 'other', 'hand', 'may', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'annual', 'Halloween', 'treat', 'one', 'year', 'year', 'may', 'consistantly', 'obnoxiously', 'trick', 'could', 'keep', 'coming', 'back', 'more', 'dog', 'returning', 'master', 'who', 'Being', 'student', 'film', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'moderate', 'filmgoer', 'seeking', 'entertainment', 'thrive', 'films', 'such', 'can', 'take', 'control', 'nerve-ending', 'twist', 'one', 'muscles', 'begin', 'stiffen', 'Perhaps', 'then', 'bad', 'dream', 'Tenant', 'embodies', 'however', 'upsetting', 'most', 'impressive', 'worthwhile', 'due', 'attention', 'detail', 'depth', 'well', 'reality', 'Yes', 'reality', 'nothing', 'short', 'off', 'more', 'terrifying', 'when', 'wishing', 'most', 'wake', 'nightmare']",The Tenant

Sometimes, on the other hand, you get a movie that should be brilliant, but isn't quite, and you can't put your finger on why. That, in a nutshell, is The Tenant.Set in the same Parisian housing crisis that was the setting for Last Tango in Paris, The Tenant is the story of Trelkovsky (Polanski), who gets an apartment in a decidedly weird building owned by Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas). While renting the place, he is told by the concierge (Shelley Winters) that the previous owner threw herself out the window; he goes to the hospital to see her (to ensure she hasn't long to go; after all, if she survives, he can't rent the apartment) and meets her friend Stella (Isabelle Adjani), with whom he embarks on a hesitant, but tumultuous, relationship. Everything seems to be going relatively well, except that the neighbors in the building are strange-- he often sees someone standing in the bathroom across the way, just staring out the window, and everyone seems to have an absurd preoccupation with noise. Eventually, Trelkovsky becomes convinced that the others in the building murdered the previous tenant, and that he's next.Roland Topor's novel, upon which this film is based, is a wonderful piece of outsider art. And what's all the more odd here is that The Tenant is, as far as adaptations go, a relatively faithful one; no major scenes or subplots were eliminated, that I could tell. What this shows, ultimately, is the futility of the idea of the faithful book-to-screen translation. Much of the subtext of Trelkovsky's character, especially the haunting feeling in the back of the reader's mind that Trelkovsky is being persecuted for being a foreigner, is absent from the film, and Polanski plays the relationship between Trelkovsky and Stella far less ambiguously than the Trelkovsky in the novel; the character here seems almost absurdly grateful at times just to have a girlfriend, even when he's discussing such topics as his possible dismemberment. His paranoia remains, but it seems an isolated thing, rather than being a symptom of his rapidly-decaying mental state. Now, yes, I do realize that such things would be nearly impossible to bring to the screen in any reasonable manner, and that Polanski had to choose which aspects of Trelkovsky's character to emphasize when filming (at least he didn't have the intermediary of an actor, who might not have read the novel, filtering the character though his own experiences). That's my point, really; in any faithful adaptation, the movie is almost sure to suffer.None of this is to say that the movie is valueless; far from it. If you like your comedy blacker than two-day-old coffee, your horror ludicrous, and your drama melo, then look no further than The Tenant for a thoroughly amusing time. However, be prepared; it's certainly not Polanski's strongest work. ***",3,"All of the ingredients are here, but it never quite sets.",1173744000,"03 13, 2007",2007,2974,"['Tenant', 'Roman', 'Polanski', '1975', 'Sometimes', 'put', 'brilliant', 'novel', 'together', 'brilliant', 'director', 'get', 'brilliant', 'movie', 'Sometimes', 'other', 'hand', 'get', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'brilliant', ""n't"", 'quite', 'ca', ""n't"", 'put', 'finger', 'why', 'nutshell', 'Tenant.Set', 'same', 'Parisian', 'housing', 'crisis', 'was', 'setting', 'Last', 'Tango', 'Paris', 'Tenant', 'story', 'Trelkovsky', 'Polanski', 'who', 'apartment', 'decidedly', 'weird', 'building', 'owned', 'Monsieur', 'Zy', 'Melvyn', 'Douglas', 'renting', 'place', 'told', 'concierge', 'Shelley', 'Winters', 'previous', 'owner', 'threw', 'out', 'window', 'hospital', 'see', 'ensure', ""n't"", 'long', 'go', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rent', 'apartment', 'friend', 'Stella', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'whom', 'hesitant', 'tumultuous', 'relationship', 'Everything', 'be', 'going', 'relatively', 'well', 'neighbors', 'building', 'are', 'strange', 'often', 'someone', 'standing', 'bathroom', 'way', 'just', 'staring', 'out', 'window', 'everyone', 'have', 'absurd', 'preoccupation', 'noise', 'Eventually', 'Trelkovsky', 'convinced', 'others', 'building', 'murdered', 'previous', 'tenant', 'next.Roland', 'Topor', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'wonderful', 'piece', 'outsider', 'art', 'what', 'more', 'odd', 'here', 'Tenant', 'as', 'far', 'adaptations', 'go', 'relatively', 'faithful', 'one', 'major', 'scenes', 'subplots', 'were', 'eliminated', 'could', 'tell', 'What', 'ultimately', 'futility', 'idea', 'faithful', 'book-to-screen', 'translation', 'Much', 'subtext', 'Trelkovsky', 'character', 'especially', 'haunting', 'feeling', 'back', 'reader', 'mind', 'Trelkovsky', 'being', 'persecuted', 'being', 'foreigner', 'absent', 'film', 'Polanski', 'relationship', 'Trelkovsky', 'Stella', 'far', 'less', 'ambiguously', 'Trelkovsky', 'novel', 'character', 'here', 'almost', 'absurdly', 'grateful', 'times', 'just', 'have', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'when', 'discussing', 'such', 'topics', 'possible', 'dismemberment', 'paranoia', 'isolated', 'thing', 'rather', 'being', 'symptom', 'rapidly-decaying', 'mental', 'state', 'Now', 'yes', 'do', 'realize', 'such', 'things', 'would', 'be', 'nearly', 'impossible', 'bring', 'screen', 'reasonable', 'manner', 'Polanski', 'had', 'choose', 'aspects', 'Trelkovsky', 'character', 'emphasize', 'when', 'filming', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'intermediary', 'actor', 'who', 'might', 'not', 'have', 'read', 'novel', 'filtering', 'character', 'own', 'experiences', 'point', 'really', 'faithful', 'adaptation', 'movie', 'almost', 'sure', 'suffer.None', 'say', 'movie', 'valueless', 'far', 'like', 'comedy', 'blacker', 'two-day-old', 'coffee', 'horror', 'ludicrous', 'drama', 'melo', 'then', 'look', 'further', 'Tenant', 'thoroughly', 'amusing', 'time', 'However', 'be', 'prepared', 'certainly', 'not', 'Polanski', 'strongest', 'work', '***']",The Tenant

Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski) suffers from schizophrenic psychosis and yearns to be a female.  Simone is his Id and he turns into Simone at night where he goes to the bar next door and buys Marlboro cigarettes and hot chocolate, etc.  In the day, he buys men's cigarettes (Gaulloise) and drinks dark coffee.  The moment when he was standing with Stella early in the film and we get to see Simone's mouth is the moment when the director of the movie chooses to tell us what happened.  This is the right interepretation: Simone and Roman Polanski are one and the same.  People will enjoy the movie more when they see it this way and understand it as a double personality.  Polanski playing as Simone did not commit the second suicide in the last scene within minutes after the first attempt, but rather there was a period of a few days that repairmen came and fixed the glass till a second suicide was attempted.  Hence the tenants said ""not again"".  Another detail is that Stella knows Simone and also knows Roman Polanski the man, she is a friend to both of them but she does not know they are the same person, till Roman Polanski gets to believe that she is ""conspiring"" against him with the other tenants and the landlord.  Another hint is that viewers should accept that there is time-jumping in the film.  Polanski as Simone now all bandaged and in the hospital is looking at Stella and Polanski the man in the last scene.  It is really the same scene as in the beginning of the movie, only we see it for what it is, a schezophrenic character: Freud would love this movie!!",5,Appreciation comes only when viewed as a psycology thriller,1193443200,"10 27, 2007",2007,1717,"['am', 'not', 'fan', 'genre', 'think', 'most', 'viewers', 'did', 'not', 'approach', 'film', 'Tenant', 'truly', 'what', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'Trelkovsky', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'suffers', 'schizophrenic', 'psychosis', 'yearns', 'be', 'female', 'Simone', 'Id', 'Simone', 'night', 'where', 'bar', 'next', 'door', 'Marlboro', 'cigarettes', 'hot', 'chocolate', 'etc', 'day', 'men', 'cigarettes', 'Gaulloise', 'dark', 'coffee', 'moment', 'when', 'was', 'standing', 'Stella', 'early', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'Simone', 'mouth', 'moment', 'when', 'director', 'movie', 'tell', 'happened', 'right', 'interepretation', 'Simone', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'are', 'one', 'same', 'People', 'will', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'more', 'when', 'see', 'way', 'understand', 'double', 'personality', 'Polanski', 'playing', 'Simone', 'did', 'not', 'commit', 'second', 'suicide', 'last', 'scene', 'minutes', 'first', 'attempt', 'rather', 'was', 'period', 'few', 'days', 'repairmen', 'came', 'fixed', 'glass', 'second', 'suicide', 'was', 'attempted', 'Hence', 'tenants', 'said', 'not', 'again', 'detail', 'Stella', 'Simone', 'also', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'man', 'friend', 'not', 'know', 'are', 'same', 'person', 'till', 'Roman', 'Polanski', 'believe', 'conspiring', 'other', 'tenants', 'landlord', 'hint', 'viewers', 'should', 'accept', 'time-jumping', 'film', 'Polanski', 'Simone', 'now', 'bandaged', 'hospital', 'looking', 'Stella', 'Polanski', 'man', 'last', 'scene', 'really', 'same', 'scene', 'beginning', 'movie', 'only', 'see', 'what', 'schezophrenic', 'character', 'Freud', 'would', 'love', 'movie']",The Tenant

If done well, I really like this type of film and found myself enjoying this one. I have not read the novel by Roland Topor, so I cannot draw comparisons between the movie and the book. It seems to me, however, that Mr. Topor was heavily influenced by the works of Franz Kafka. His use of absurdities, such as playing soccer with a human head and Mr. Trelkovsky changing into a woman, reminds me of ""The Metamorphosis."" The alienation, sense of solitude and conspiracy reminds me of ""The Trial."" Despite its morbid themes, the film also has a pervasive, dark humor to it that reminds me of both Kafka's writing and Stanley Kubrick's films. The film begins innocuously enough and really takes its time to build suspense. Although known as a director, it turns out Polanski can act and is quite charming and charismatic. It is his ability to carry the film as an actor that draws us into this film and captivates us, even though nothing terribly exciting happens at the onset. The film is filled with interesting characters and terrific dialogue, which alone would be enough to make the film worth recommending. Then there is the luminous Isabelle Adjani, who alone also would make the film worth watching. She is absolutely gorgeous, even behind those massive 70's glasses and funky clothes. Unfortunately, her time on screen is all too brief. One thing that bothers me a little is the fact the film was apparently shot in both English and in French, though one of the languages is dubbed, depending on which language track you choose. (i.e. the English is dubbed if watching in French and the French is dubbed if watching in English) I would rather watch the film in the original language with subtitles, even if it was shot using two or more languages. Just a minor grievance. Although it has nothing to do with the content of the film, I couldn't help but contemplate the relationship between Polanski and Eva Ionesco, who was about ten or eleven when the film was shot. Everyone is aware Mr. Polanski was forced to leave the United States because if his illicit contact with a thirteen year old girl, and most are aware that young Miss Ionesco posed nude for her mother at about the same age and appeared nude in such films as ""Spielen Wir Liebe."" Given that Mr. Polanski is also a photographer, I just could not resist wondering about that.",4,If you like Kafka...,1164067200,"11 21, 2006",2006,2451,"['Yes', 'bizarre', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'films', 'little', 'artsy', 'might', 'want', 'steer', 'clear', 'done', 'well', 'really', 'type', 'film', 'found', 'enjoying', 'one', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'novel', 'Roland', 'Topor', 'can', 'not', 'draw', 'comparisons', 'movie', 'book', 'however', 'Mr.', 'Topor', 'was', 'heavily', 'influenced', 'works', 'Franz', 'Kafka', 'use', 'absurdities', 'such', 'playing', 'soccer', 'human', 'head', 'Mr.', 'Trelkovsky', 'changing', 'woman', 'Metamorphosis', 'alienation', 'sense', 'solitude', 'conspiracy', 'reminds', 'Trial', 'morbid', 'themes', 'film', 'also', 'pervasive', 'dark', 'humor', 'Kafka', 'writing', 'Stanley', 'Kubrick', 'films', 'film', 'innocuously', 'enough', 'really', 'time', 'build', 'suspense', 'known', 'director', 'out', 'Polanski', 'can', 'act', 'quite', 'charming', 'charismatic', 'ability', 'carry', 'film', 'actor', 'film', 'even', 'nothing', 'terribly', 'exciting', 'happens', 'onset', 'film', 'filled', 'interesting', 'characters', 'terrific', 'dialogue', 'alone', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'make', 'film', 'recommending', 'Then', 'luminous', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'who', 'alone', 'also', 'would', 'make', 'film', 'worth', 'watching', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'even', 'massive', '70', 'glasses', 'funky', 'clothes', 'Unfortunately', 'time', 'screen', 'too', 'brief', 'One', 'thing', 'little', 'fact', 'film', 'was', 'apparently', 'shot', 'English', 'French', 'one', 'languages', 'dubbed', 'depending', 'language', 'track', 'choose', 'i.e', 'English', 'dubbed', 'watching', 'French', 'French', 'dubbed', 'watching', 'English', 'would', 'rather', 'watch', 'film', 'original', 'language', 'subtitles', 'even', 'was', 'shot', 'using', 'two', 'more', 'languages', 'Just', 'minor', 'grievance', 'nothing', 'do', 'content', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'contemplate', 'relationship', 'Polanski', 'Eva', 'Ionesco', 'who', 'was', 'about', 'ten', 'eleven', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'Everyone', 'aware', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'was', 'forced', 'leave', 'United', 'States', 'illicit', 'contact', 'thirteen', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'most', 'are', 'aware', 'young', 'Miss', 'Ionesco', 'posed', 'nude', 'mother', 'same', 'age', 'appeared', 'nude', 'such', 'films', 'Spielen', 'Wir', 'Liebe', 'Mr.', 'Polanski', 'also', 'photographer', 'just', 'could', 'not', 'resist', 'wondering']",The Tenant

A Russian man in Paris rents an apartment where the previous tenant committed suicide. This gentleman, like you and I, does not ""comprehend suicide"" so he wonders why the girl had jumped to death. As he convinces himself that he'll  never meet the fate that awaited his predecessor in the apartment, his paranoia very gradually takes over as he finds quaint neighbors.Was it loneliness? Was it an egregious fear of NOT wanting to turn out like the previous tenant? Whatever the reason, the movie soon takes on contours of blurring the Reality with the Imagined, and it is very, very scary.

Towsley,"[9, 10]","Roman Polanski became one of cinema's most capable film directors, and THE TENANT is among his very finest works in or out of Hollywood.Polanski has an unparalleled ability to externalize and visualize human insanity, or impending insanity, and to portray that condition of mind on-screen in a way that is clear and understandable and palpable to a broad audience.Other filmmakers certainly have portrayed hallucination, for instance, but rarely do we see a film that requires no explanation, interpretation or telegraphing, regarding which images are delusional.Roman Polanski needs no such decoder ring.  He has a positive genius for devising images and shots which portray delusions as we would expect them to be; we quickly know what is illusion, what is reality, and what is, at a given point in his story's time line, still ambiguous for the story's purpose.THE TENANT is a delectable treat for those viewers who can appreciate a journey into darkness, odd personalities, and extremely wry humor generated by nothing more contrived than human characters we've all encountered ourselves at some time or another.The film segues deftly and seamlessly -- from serious moments, to undeniably hilarious moments, to moments of disturbing, frightening images leading inexorably to sub-climaxes, large or small, of stark horror.THE TENANT is a fully formed film from start to finish, starting benignly enough (as with REPULSION) and developing into moments of human dysfunction to make one's skin crawl.The last act and its climax are full of emotional complexity and revelation -- but so, in its way, is Polanski's first act as it establishes the protagonist's off-kilter existence at his new apartment.The film is perfectly visualized with a sound effects track as inspired as that of ROSEMARY'S BABY. There are clues in it that casual viewers may miss.Until REPULSION, this film's closest relative, is remastered, sharpened and fully framed, THE TENANT will stand unchallenged in Polanski's stellar career as his most disturbing film.A slight spoiler:  The scene in which a woman's decapitated head is bouncing like a basketball with hair flying at Roman's balcony window would clinch this film's creative reputation single-handedly. But combined with the elderly folk in the downstairs apartment who blast their stereo with old standards and marching music for their own unique reasons, you have something far beyond the realm of mundane horror films.  This is thoughtful art exploring aspects of the human condition, inspired by a director with a singular eye for things quintessentially unsettling.",5,"For film enthusiasts who love hypnotic, disturbing atmosphere.

If you know anything about this man's life, what he went through (and what he was about to go through, a scandal that caused him to flee the U.S.), the events in this very darkly humorous tale become all the more haunting.The basic story: a socially awkward clerk moves in to an apartment previously occupied by a young woman who just died from injuries sustained by hurtling herself from that very apartment window. What he doesn't realize is that, by his moving in, the stage has been set for him to inherit the very miserable despair that possessed the former tenant. In the course of his solitary tenency, he hears disturbing sounds, sees strange things inside and outside his flat, and encounters inexplicable hostility from others in the building. Over time, he becomes increasingly unnerved and obsessed, incapable of controlling his own behavior, and the line between reality and delusion ultimately dissolves, giving way to psychosis.This dark ride is not without Polanski's trademark warped, absurdist humor, and one gets a sense from sharing the deteriorating experience of his self-portrayed protagonist that he himself was trying to find a way to laugh at his own miseries and fears. This could be a therapeutic element of this film; by watching the ridiculously hopeless and wretched scenario unfold, hopefully we can laugh at our own vulnerabilities, while at the same time seeing that element in other peoples' callous behavior that drives others into such a state.With Polanski's new found recognition in a film industry that cautiously turned its back on him nearly 30 years ago, we are finally given a chance to see this forgotten treasure, and it's about time. I've read many comparisons to Taxi Driver, but the subtle supernatural implications found in The Tenant's more surreal moments remind me more of The Shining, wherein an alienated individual renders himself prone to dark, irrational powers by way of his own obsession. A quiet, well-paced primal scream of a movie, this number will definitely give the viewer a twisted chuckle, and more than a few shivers after it ends.
