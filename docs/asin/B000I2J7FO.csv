Ed Sullivan originally wanted nothing to do with Elvis, considering him to be too vulgar for TV audiences.  However, all that changed when Steve Allen booked Elvis on his show and handily beat Sullivan in the ratings.  Then Sullivan booked for three appearances, and the rest was history as the saying goes.  This DVD includes all three of Elvis' appearances on Sullivan's show, which set records for ratings at the time.  During his last appearance, Elvis was shot only from the waste up due to complaints about the suggestive nature of his dancing during the first two performances (my how things have changed).  Elvis is at his creative peak for these performances and it is easy to see why he took the nation (and world) by storm in 1956.  Performances like these firmly established him as the King of Rock and Roll.  This DVD is a must for fans of Elvis and students of pop culture.",5,Pieces of Rock and Roll History!,1251676800,"08 31, 2009",2009,977,"['appearances', 'were', 'legendary', 'solidified', 'Elvis', 'hold', 'American', 'popular', 'culture', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'originally', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'do', 'Elvis', 'considering', 'be', 'too', 'vulgar', 'TV', 'audiences', 'However', 'changed', 'when', 'Steve', 'Allen', 'booked', 'Elvis', 'show', 'handily', 'beat', 'Sullivan', 'ratings', 'Then', 'Sullivan', 'booked', 'three', 'appearances', 'rest', 'was', 'history', 'saying', 'DVD', 'three', 'Elvis', 'appearances', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'set', 'records', 'ratings', 'time', 'last', 'appearance', 'Elvis', 'was', 'shot', 'only', 'waste', 'up', 'due', 'complaints', 'suggestive', 'nature', 'dancing', 'first', 'two', 'performances', 'how', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'Elvis', 'creative', 'peak', 'performances', 'easy', 'see', 'why', 'took', 'nation', 'world', 'storm', '1956', 'Performances', 'firmly', 'established', 'King', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'DVD', 'must', 'fans', 'Elvis', 'students', 'pop', 'culture']",Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows
1018742,A2CZPM110DW516,B000I2J7FO,"Brian W. Fairbanks ""Brian W. Fairbanks""","[11, 11]","Elvis Presley made no less than nine network television appearances before performing on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" the evening of September 9, 1956, but most of America first saw him then. Despite a stiff demeanor and tendency to pronounce show as ""shoe,"" Sullivan was the ringmaster of American entertainment. His Sunday night variety program was an institution in the days when television was still a three channel proposition. Appearing on his show was an important break for any entertainer. It was tantamount to receiving the show business seal of approval.But Sullivan originally did not approve of Presley and vowed he wouldn't touch the singer with a ten foot pole. Despite selling more records faster than any recording artist in history, Presley was more than hot. He was scorching. The swivel hips that earned him the nickname ""Elvis the Pelvis"" (which he despised, calling it ""childish"") and his expressive singing style made him a lightning rod of controversy. One journalist compared his stage act to that of a stripper. However, when Presley appeared on ""The Steve Allen Show"" which was scheduled opposite Sullivan on Sunday nights, the ratings went through the roof. Sullivan reversed himself and offered Presley a then record $50,000 to make three appearances on his show.Just how shocking Presley was in 1956 was never apparent in the frequently recycled clips of his performances. Now, thanks to Image Entertainment's 3 disc DVD set, ""Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Show,"" his performances can be seen in their proper context.Ironically, a car accident prevented Sullivan from being present that first night. Charles Laughton, the brilliant British stage and screen actor (and husband of Elsa Lanchester, ""The Bride of Frankenstein""), was the guest host that night, kicking off the proceedings by reading some poetry followed by limericks. The Brothers Amin, an acrobatic act, came next, then Dorothy Sarnoff performed a song from Broadway's ""The King and I."" After a commercial, Laughton, standing before a wall of Presley's gold records, introduced the man whom a record 55 million viewers tuned in to see.Wearing a plaid jacket and a guitar slung over his chest like a machine gun, Presley blasts his way into ""Don't Be Cruel"" and it's a little like Moses parting the Red Sea. Prior to Elvis, entertainment didn't have to be rated with letters signifying what age group should be permitted to watch. Families watched TV and listened to music the same way they went to the movies: together. Now Elvis came to drive them apart.Teenagers love him, of course, especially the girls, and what was there not to like? Handsome, but in a way men had not been before; threatening, yet still somehow tame, as if his mask of menace was only meant to conceal a wounded heart. He is, after all, very well-mannered, saying ""Yes, sir"" and thanking ""Mr."" Laughton. What was one to make of this guy with the unusual name, the pompadour, and the long sideburns?""He just does this,"" Ed Sullivan would say while shaking his body on the October 28 show, ""and everybody yells."" Presley looked a little more sinister this time in his dark suit, and he offers reprises of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Love Me Tender,"" and ""Hound Dog"" while also introducing one of his sultriest numbers, ""Love Me.""What did Dorothy Sarnoff think? And Senor Wences, who was on the bill the same night Presley appeared a second time?Clearly, show business had been rocked into a new dimension.His third and final appearance for Sullivan came on January 6, 1957 on a show that also featured Carol Burnett, one of the few stars whose wattage would increase in future years. By now, the country was clearly divided into two camps: those who championed the King of Rock and Roll, and those who condemned him. Sullivan was now in the former, surprising audiences and Elvis himself by proclaiming him a ""good,decent boy.""But there was no turning back. Soon, people would be talking about the ""generation gap"" and, later, ""youth culture."" The gap would widen in the `60s with even Presley taking his place among the old guard, but the gap started here. With the release of Elvis-The Ed Sullivan Show on DVD, it's now possible to properly assess the earth shaking impact Presley had in the more innocent era of the 1950's.Brian W.

1018744,AM7PR12D8180Q,B000I2J7FO,"J. Lund ""jazzbrat""","[52, 59]","The release of this DVD set is important for a number of reasons.  As with the Beatles DVD of their 1964-65 Ed Sullivan appearances (available separately), the complete original broadcasts allow the viewer to see legendary performances in the context of what passed for mainstream entertainment back in the day (1956-57 for Elvis, mid-sixties for the Beatles).  As such, the impact of these paradigm-busting pop culture legends can be compared and contrasted with the entertainment norms of their respective eras, as opposed to measuring them by ill-fitting contemporary standards.  In other words, although neither Elvis nor the Beatles are shocking by today's standards, the high quality of their actual musical performances is what is going to get these DVDs watched repeatedly by most purchasers.  By the way, the video and audio restoration (from kinescopes) is remarkably well done.It would be inaccurate to say that Elvis was not ""ready for prime time."" given the fact that his Ed Sullivan appearances broke ratings records when they originally aired.  Nonetheless, his segments were controversial to the point where he was filmed from the waist up on the third show (not all three, as is sometimes reported).  Elvis and his acclaimed original band (guitarist Scotty Moore, bassist Bill Black, and drummer DJ Fontana, plus the Jordanaires on backing vocals) perform well-known hits (""Hound Dog,"" ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Love Me Tender,"" ""Ready Teddy,"" ""Too Much,"" etc.), and even a gospel tune on the ""censored"" third show (""Peace In The Valley"").  Several of these tunes are performed on two or even all three broadcasts.  Furthermore, some viewers conditioned by pop culture mythology to expect an Elvis-shaped tornado swiveling constantly on stage may be disappointed to see that Presley's then-shocking gyrations are only significantly evident on ""Ready Teddy"" (1st show) and ""Hound Dog"" (2nd show).  Of course, there's more to Elvis' talents than meet the eye.Even given the pop cultural context that the release of the entire shows provide, is is still amazing how shocking his appearances were considered to be, given how generally unthreatening he appears on camera.  I've always been a bit annoyed by Elvis' habit of  tossing little humorous asides into his performances (e.g., self-conscious lyric alterations, exaggerated facial or vocal expressions ... that in my opinion suggest that Presley doesn't have confidence that he would ever be accepted as anything more than a short-lived fad, and thus wants to appear to be in on the joke).  However, these mannerisms are kept to a minimum here: they seemingly make him less threatening to audiences not used to the relative fury of rock'n'roll, but are not done to excess so as to detract from the impact of the music itself.The only drawback to issuing the entirety of the Ed Sullivan shows is that most of the other performances are painfully dated (which is why I rated the DVD 4 stars rather than 5, which Elvis deserves).  Sullivan seemed to favor vaudeville-era musical and comic stage performers, circus acts, etc. (which to be fair was a winning formula that kept him on the air from 1948 to 1971).  It's not that the other guests don't have particular talents (as some suggest), but it is ironic that most of them don't stand the test of time, whereas supposed flash-in-the-pan Elvis' performances hold up well a half-century later.  In fact, most DVD viewers are likely to be familiar with only one other guest among the three shows (an early appearance by famed comedienne Carol Burnett).  Particularly if one is interested in the larger pop culture picture, there is a fascination in seeing these timeworn acts perhaps once or twice.  Fortunately for subsequent viewings, there is an option in the menus to view only the Elvis segments and bonus material (which are why this DVD set exists in the first place).  For Elvis and rock'n'roll fans, these moments will be worth the price of admission.",4,"Three ""really big shews,"" thanks to Elvis' appearances (which rate 5 stars)",1164585600,"11 27, 2006",2006,3968,"['release', 'DVD', 'set', 'important', 'number', 'reasons', 'Beatles', 'DVD', '1964-65', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'appearances', 'available', 'separately', 'complete', 'original', 'broadcasts', 'allow', 'viewer', 'see', 'legendary', 'performances', 'context', 'what', 'passed', 'mainstream', 'entertainment', 'back', 'day', '1956-57', 'Elvis', 'mid-sixties', 'Beatles', 'such', 'impact', 'paradigm-busting', 'pop', 'culture', 'can', 'be', 'compared', 'contrasted', 'entertainment', 'norms', 'respective', 'eras', 'opposed', 'measuring', 'ill-fitting', 'contemporary', 'standards', 'other', 'words', 'Elvis', 'Beatles', 'are', 'shocking', 'today', 'standards', 'high', 'quality', 'actual', 'musical', 'performances', 'what', 'going', 'get', 'DVDs', 'watched', 'repeatedly', 'most', 'purchasers', 'way', 'video', 'audio', 'restoration', 'kinescopes', 'remarkably', 'well', 'done.It', 'would', 'be', 'inaccurate', 'say', 'Elvis', 'was', 'not', 'ready', 'prime', 'time', 'given', 'fact', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'broke', 'ratings', 'records', 'when', 'originally', 'aired', 'Nonetheless', 'segments', 'were', 'controversial', 'point', 'where', 'was', 'filmed', 'waist', 'up', 'third', 'show', 'not', 'three', 'sometimes', 'reported', 'Elvis', 'acclaimed', 'original', 'band', 'guitarist', 'Scotty', 'Moore', 'bassist', 'Bill', 'Black', 'drummer', 'DJ', 'Fontana', 'Jordanaires', 'backing', 'vocals', 'perform', 'well-known', 'hits', 'Hound', 'Dog', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'Cruel', 'Love', 'Me', 'Tender', 'Ready', 'Teddy', 'Too', 'Much', 'etc', 'even', 'gospel', 'tune', 'censored', 'third', 'show', 'Peace', 'Valley', 'Several', 'tunes', 'are', 'performed', 'two', 'even', 'three', 'broadcasts', 'Furthermore', 'viewers', 'conditioned', 'pop', 'culture', 'mythology', 'expect', 'Elvis-shaped', 'tornado', 'swiveling', 'constantly', 'stage', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'see', 'Presley', 'then-shocking', 'gyrations', 'are', 'only', 'significantly', 'evident', 'Ready', 'Teddy', '1st', 'show', 'Hound', 'Dog', '2nd', 'show', 'course', 'more', 'Elvis', 'talents', 'meet', 'eye.Even', 'given', 'pop', 'cultural', 'context', 'release', 'entire', 'shows', 'provide', 'still', 'amazing', 'how', 'shocking', 'appearances', 'were', 'considered', 'be', 'given', 'how', 'generally', 'unthreatening', 'camera', ""'ve"", 'always', 'been', 'bit', 'annoyed', 'Elvis', 'habit', 'tossing', 'little', 'humorous', 'asides', 'performances', 'e.g.', 'self-conscious', 'lyric', 'alterations', 'exaggerated', 'facial', 'vocal', 'expressions', 'opinion', 'suggest', 'Presley', ""n't"", 'have', 'confidence', 'would', 'ever', 'be', 'accepted', 'anything', 'more', 'short-lived', 'fad', 'thus', 'appear', 'be', 'joke', 'However', 'mannerisms', 'are', 'kept', 'minimum', 'here', 'seemingly', 'make', 'less', 'threatening', 'audiences', 'not', 'used', 'relative', 'fury', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'are', 'not', 'done', 'excess', 'so', 'detract', 'impact', 'music', 'only', 'drawback', 'issuing', 'entirety', 'Ed', 'Sullivan', 'most', 'other', 'performances', 'are', 'painfully', 'dated', 'why', 'rated', 'DVD', '4', 'stars', 'rather', '5', 'Elvis', 'Sullivan', 'seemed', 'favor', 'vaudeville-era', 'musical', 'comic', 'stage', 'performers', 'circus', 'acts', 'etc', 'be', 'fair', 'was', 'winning', 'formula', 'kept', 'air', '1948', '1971', 'not', 'other', 'guests', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'particular', 'talents', 'suggest', 'ironic', 'most', 'do', ""n't"", 'stand', 'test', 'time', 'whereas', 'supposed', 'flash-in-the-pan', 'Elvis', 'performances', 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'half-century', 'later', 'fact', 'most', 'DVD', 'viewers', 'are', 'likely', 'be', 'familiar', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'guest', 'three', 'shows', 'early', 'appearance', 'famed', 'comedienne', 'Carol', 'Burnett', 'Particularly', 'one', 'interested', 'larger', 'pop', 'culture', 'picture', 'fascination', 'seeing', 'timeworn', 'acts', 'perhaps', 'once', 'twice', 'Fortunately', 'subsequent', 'viewings', 'option', 'menus', 'view', 'only', 'Elvis', 'segments', 'bonus', 'material', 'are', 'why', 'DVD', 'set', 'exists', 'first', 'place', 'Elvis', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'fans', 'moments', 'will', 'be', 'price', 'admission']",Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows

The other acts like Ballantine the Magician and Carol Burnette seem much more respectful and sincere in trying to entertain their audience. With Elvis and his band, even the sound plays rather thin.

1018748,A1TCH4ASNV4H51,B000I2J7FO,Maddy,"[1, 1]","The documentary made me cry since he was such a gifted giant and his life was cut short. I heard him on the radio in 1956 as a little kid and I recall dancing to his music. I danced the lindy again to his songs when I heard him sing on the dvd on the ed sullivan show. We didnt own a tv set since we were poor. I enjoyed watching the thrill on Mr. Sullivans face as he really admired this young boy and made him feel welcome in New York. Today people have to understand that most parents disaproved of his music. Teenagers saw and heard differently just as they were at the paramount theatre in the 1940s when frank sinatra was playing there. Teenagers found their voice. The sullivan producer made a dig at opera as if to segway to the new generation of music.  Elvis made it look simple, orchestrating his jordanaire quartet, playing the guitar, singing his heart out and revealing his emotions and he could really do a cool New Orleans stomp (and a one leg half twist)not just shake. He was a product of the mississipi delta and memphis and worked very hard to get to where he was. The Sun records founder says he was not surprised Elvis hit it bigtime and he was his most enduring star in a tribute. Elvis was humble, kind and generous but towards the end of his life his mind and talent were waisted by presription abuse.He had lost his roots. Elvis was so tolerant that his Memphis tailor, his first girlfriend and his landlord were all jewish. He was a shabbos goy.

1018751,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,B000I2J7FO,Phil S.,"[6, 6]","We've all seen the clips of Elvis on the Sullivan Shows; now we have the complete performances, in context (although the first appearance is not the full Sullivan show). There are three songs from the final show which to my knowledge have never been reshown, so that is probably enough reason for many fans/historians to purchase this set.There's something mildly disconcerting, however, in watching the change in Elvis over that 3-4 month period. In September, 1956, he seems intent on sustaining musical integrity - the renditions are every bit as good as the records. In late October, with his hair dyed, he seems slightly detached, as if he realizes or senses that with the amazing career rise, the music is now secondary. By January, the image is everything. One of the Jordanaires hands him his guitar, he straps it on...it's just a photo opportunity - harbinger of what was to come later in the movies.It should be noted, though, that the January show has the lesser known When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again; also, a version of Too Much with some different lyrics (musicologists, can you hear some of Hank Ballard & the Midnighters' Annie's Aunt Fannie on this number?); and, of course, the gospel number Peace In The Valley. It's interesting that about one month earlier he sang this song with his Sun Records friends. Maybe this rendition brought him back to a more peaceful setting.For the record, there are brief appearances by Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson; an energetic Carol Burnett.Quality is very good, even on the original commercials.",4,Wildly incongruous,1168041600,"01 6, 2007",2007,1561,"[""'ve"", 'seen', 'clips', 'Elvis', 'Sullivan', 'Shows', 'now', 'have', 'complete', 'performances', 'context', 'first', 'appearance', 'not', 'full', 'Sullivan', 'show', 'are', 'three', 'songs', 'final', 'show', 'knowledge', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'reshown', 'probably', 'enough', 'reason', 'many', 'fans/historians', 'purchase', 'set.There', 'something', 'mildly', 'disconcerting', 'however', 'watching', 'change', 'Elvis', '3-4', 'month', 'period', 'September', '1956', 'intent', 'sustaining', 'musical', 'integrity', 'renditions', 'are', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'records', 'late', 'October', 'hair', 'dyed', 'slightly', 'detached', 'amazing', 'career', 'rise', 'music', 'now', 'secondary', 'January', 'image', 'everything', 'One', 'Jordanaires', 'guitar', 'just', 'photo', 'opportunity', 'harbinger', 'what', 'was', 'come', 'later', 'movies.It', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'though', 'January', 'show', 'lesser', 'known', 'When', 'My', 'Blue', 'Moon', 'Turns', 'Gold', 'Again', 'also', 'version', 'Too', 'Much', 'different', 'lyrics', 'musicologists', 'can', 'hear', 'Hank', 'Ballard', 'Midnighters', 'Annie', 'Aunt', 'Fannie', 'number', 'course', 'gospel', 'number', 'Peace', 'Valley', 'interesting', 'one', 'month', 'earlier', 'sang', 'song', 'Sun', 'Records', 'friends', 'Maybe', 'rendition', 'brought', 'back', 'more', 'peaceful', 'setting.For', 'record', 'are', 'brief', 'appearances', 'Jackie', 'Robinson', 'Sugar', 'Ray', 'Robinson', 'energetic', 'Carol', 'Burnett.Quality', 'very', 'good', 'even', 'original', 'commercials']",Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows

After wading through home-video excerpts, we finally have a DVD set with all three Elvis programs shown in their proper context. This includes Ed's vaudevillian potpourri (ranging from impressionist Will Jordan to a young Carol Burnett) and vintage Lincoln Mercury commercials. Nevertheless, it is Elvis who rocks the house whenever he takes the stage. By the final show, Presley assumes full command in his ""waist up"" performances of ""Don't Be Cruel,"" ""Too Much"" and a stirring ""Peace in the Valley."" However, pay close attention to the September 1956 broadcast, with Charles Laughton substituting for the injured Sullivan.
