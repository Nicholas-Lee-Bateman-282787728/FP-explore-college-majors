1040111,A37PV5GMP2ILJC,B000LPS49I,Amanda Richards,"[3, 5]","Some things just sound better with a British accent, and that's the problem with this American adaptation of the farcical play by Ray Cooney.  Obviously intended for the British stage and audience, the plot is about the complications that arise when the lead character Henry Perkins (an ancient looking Chevy Chase) accidentally switches briefcases with a tough-looking guy on the train, and discovers that he is the new custodian of a large and undoubtedly illegal fortune in notes and bearer bonds.Perkins decides to take the money and run, but his young wife (Penelope Ann Miller) remains unconvinced.  The arrival of an undercover cop (Armand Assante), and a comedian moonlighting as a cab driver (or vice versa), and then their friends Vic and Betty, followed by another police officer, and then even more minor characters, leads to an amazing and absolutely befuddling sequence of variable identities, assumption-leaping and confusion that could only come from the pen of funnyman Cooney.What the film lacked was the dry and bawdy (yet always hysterically funny) British comedic inflections and delivery, which made some of the truly great moments fall rather flat.  The cast does their best given the Americanization of the plot, but this would have been a heck of a movie with a British cast.

Surprising to see Chevy Chase as a mature man when I remember him as a young man on SNL. The comedy in this movie is mostly verbal and situational rather than comedy movements (of which Chase is so well known). The plot is rather simple: an accidential exchange of identical briefcases leaves Chase with $$$$$$ rather than a sandwitch. Alot of comedy about this discovery between Chase, his wife and some family friends. More comedy about those who lost the money and their search to find it. And when the two groups find each other ... oh yeah, funny.Again, this is not a slap-stick comedy. It is well written with great dialog, situations and events.

It's the kind of humor that shows why you should never EVER lie in *any* situation, because it will come back to bite you in the backside (and in this particular case, in more ways than one!)It's about Chevy Chase's character who finds a briefcase containing 5 million dollars in cash.  The bad guys who want the money back play a major part in the storyline near the end.Anyway, Chevy Chase comes home, completely shocked, -on his birthday- while company is expected to be over for dinner.His wife doesn't understand why she has to pack her bags and leave the country immediately.  This is becuase Chase hasn't yet told her about the money he found.  As soon as his wife finds out, WOW, haha.  Lots and lots of storyline twists constantly flow from ALL directions.This is where I absolutely LOVE this film.  It's a style of comedy that has tons of creativity, not to mention a carefully created storyline that must have taken several weeks (or months) for the writers to come up with to get it *just right*.  It's such a complex plot.Just before Chase's character and his wife are about to head out the door to head for the airport, a bunch of people (including a detective and a taxi driver) come over to question Chase and his wife.  Meanwhile Chase's character and his wife must do everything humanly possible to come up with lies so they don't reveal they're actually guilty and have a 5 million dollar suitcase in their house.Each of the characters that come into the picture have amazing and distinct personalities, which makes the movie THAT much funnier.I must have forgotten how funny Chevy Chase was in the late 80's because I went into this film not expecting much and instead got a classic movie that had me laughing in tears for the entire time (except for the first 10 minutes of film that focused on a banana company, which wasn't very funny).

It's the worst song in a film I've ever heard, the worst singing I've ever heard on screen (even on American Idol!), the most cliched tropical island theme, and the most moronic words to a song ever made!  No kidding, this is the worst movie I've ever seen! A couple of teenagers with camcorders could have come up with a better movie! This movie assaults your senses in every way!  It's an adaptation of a British play that has no appeal on the big screen. None!  Not that I have any love for British comedy but it had to have been better on the stage.  The plot is the time worn moronic plot of someone finding alot of money.  After that it's not worth going into the plot for even if you can figure it out the acting is so bad it's not worth sitting through the movie.Chevy Chase has the main role and he's pathetic. They could have gotten a schizophrenic from the local homeless shelter to give a more inspiring performance. It's like Chevy had a lobotomy after National Lampoon's Vacation (which had some hysterical bits) and he's like 3 seconds out of sync with the rest of the world.  Did anyone ever see his talk show that got cancelled after a few episodes?  Point made!He must have put his own money into this because I can't see any investors dumb enough to bet on a movie with him in a lead role.  And I'm not just bashing Chevy.  I loved him in SNL, and I loved NL's Vacation.  Maybe that is why I am so disappointed most of his other performances have been so moronic.  Anyway, the cast has some well known stars such as Armand Assante and Penelope Miller, but they can't help this awful film.This film was made in Romania, for which reason I can only assume was to save money. The film opened at 4 screens in America and made like $2900 total box office receipts. It made over $30,000 in box office receipts in Europe, probably because it had some big names, was a British invention, and word of mouth travels slower across Europe.  However, it made a total of 19 million overall, which I assume were cable tv rights and dvd sales.  So, maybe they broke even, which goes to show that if you get a few big names in a movie, no matter how bad the movie is, you can sell it to cable and dvd and make some money.What amazed me was that it was the most popular film at the Sarasota Film Festival!  That is truly mind boggling!  The only thing I can think is that it was the only film AT the Sarasota Film Festival!
