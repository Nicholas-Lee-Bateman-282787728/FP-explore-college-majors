The Mother did try to change and get her life together. It was kinda funny to me when the Mom went and sat in front of the Police station and started doing her drugs right in front of the officer. At first I was like what is she doing but I soon  saw that she was asking for help with her drug problem so she got herself arrested. I think the movie was worth seeing.,3,Rain,1286668800,"10 10, 2010",2010,508,"['movie', 'was', 'different', 'was', 'about', 'more', 'one', 'issue', 'never', 'really', 'came', 'out', 'said', 'Whether', 'young', 'girls', 'Mother', 'had', 'HIV', 'not', 'Mother', 'did', 'try', 'change', 'get', 'life', 'together', 'was', 'kinda', 'funny', 'when', 'Mom', 'went', 'sat', 'front', 'Police', 'station', 'started', 'doing', 'drugs', 'right', 'front', 'officer', 'first', 'was', 'what', 'doing', 'soon', 'saw', 'was', 'asking', 'help', 'drug', 'problem', 'got', 'arrested', 'think', 'movie', 'was', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A
