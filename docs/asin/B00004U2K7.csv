I found it interesting to watch the Bowler family adapt to  the circa 1900 world, couldn't help thinking that they'd never have made it through a year of that life.  I was actually more disappointed with the experts who set the house up for them, the guys who restored the house to period form do that for a living yet they had a terrible time getting the stove going and the others seemed to do their work largely by looking at picture books.Although you miss so much due to the need to edit 3 months of video down to about four hours it's still worth viewing.

The show looked promising at first.When will PBS ever learn?  You can not place modern people who are brainwashed with modern principles and expect them to follow the rules without bickering, whining, complaining and crying.The females are too bossy and pushy to be ladies of the house.  The males are too wimpy and henpecked to be the masters of the house. PBS must interview these people better and ask them questions about the household structure and how they feel about it.  That's the only way that they will ever find a suitable family for these shows.All that the mom did was whine and complain.  Nothing ever made her happy.  First she complained that there was too much housework.  So, she hired a maid.  She did not supervise her maid very well.  She said that she did not know how to reprimand her for being late on more than one occasion. Rather than doing the right thing and handling it properly and directly , she wrote her a letter firing her.  Then she went back to complaining that she had too much housework to do and that she was bored with it.The husband/dad did not even have enough guts to stand up to his wife and daughter and tell them that they could not perform that silly feminist song at the theater.  Any real man would have stood up to them, so as to not ruin the reputation of the family.  In those days theater people were considered lowest of the low.  No self respecting man would put up with such nonsense from his wife and daughter.What's the point of PBS going to all of the trouble and expense of doing a historical recreation if they do not even bother to enforce their own rules?

With the romanticism of the Victorian Era, we expect that life during the turn of the century was more simple and more calm.  The family that decides to live life this way for a few months end up with some surprising discoveries.The Bowlers are given an assignment to live life exactly like people did 100 years ago for approximately three months.  Mrs. Bowler openly admits during their experiment that in the beginning they were simply &quot;having fun dressing up&quot; but after awhile they realized that they had to do much more than wear costumes.The Bowlers discover that life is a bit more difficult to handle while living in their alter-egos.  For instance, Mrs. Bowler has difficulty keeping her vegetarian lifestyle as she is subjected to the staple diet of 1900 (let alone a very bland diet back then that her fussy son refuses to eat.)  Also, cleaning alone can take ten times the effort as well as the laundry being a three-day job.  They have to get used to using bedpans and an outhouse as well as the daily stringing of the corset (to which two of them suffer shortness of breath) and if they get sick, they have to use only medications provided back then -- nothing modern.  Everything and anything they encounter has to be from 1900 and when it comes down to simple haircare, Mrs. Bowler gets literally fed up with the shampoo of that time and in a moment of weakness, grabs a bottle of modern conditioner at the store (which she gets in trouble for later.)The whole family is able to record their personal opinions in what I refer to as the &quot;venting cabinet.&quot;  It's basically a camera in a closet that they open up and talk to about their opinions, wishes and desires.  We see Mrs. Bowler use it quite a bit as she is genuinely frustrated with her older lifestyle.  Her husband, who has an easier time (being that he is the male bread-winner of the family and isn't expected to help clean) still helps out with housework and seems as if he's genuinely having a good time figuring out the stove and making the stove keep burning to keep the family warm for the night.  Still, little things are taken for granted, such as swimming during menstral periods are very taboo and lack of fresh eggs in the morning are soon remedied by obtaining a small coop of chickens in the backyard.A very interesting portrayal of how it was back in the Victorian age and a must-see for those of you who are interested in that time period as well as anyone who loves those reality shows.

We have all seen those dreadful &quot;Victorian Christmas&quot; and &quot;Victorian Wedding&quot; books.  It is an era that just oozes nostalgia.&quot;1900 House&quot; should kill any feelings of nostalgia once and for all.  Even though the technology looks familiar, it is clearly a struggle for this family to cope for any length of time.  The family was equipped with what was close to cutting-edge technology, but found every-day life to be tough sledding.  All this without showing the amazingly constricting moral constraints of the Victorian &amp; Edwardian eras, which probably would have put the Bowler over the edge once and for all.As other reviewers have correctly observed, there is a conspicuous lack of context in this show, as the very crucial aspects of social life &amp; religious life are simply absent.  The Bowlers might as well have been living on a desert island, because there is precious little indication of life outside the house itself.What we are left with is not so much a lesson in history as an anti-nostalgic smack upside the head, as we are reminded regularly that we, as modern-day people, could not cope with life in 1900, no matter how familiar that life may appear.Just as nostalgia distorts history by emphasizing only the good stuff, this show similarly distorts history by presenting 1900's life as a non-stop struggle, but without putting it in its proper context.

While I realize that too much of history has been rewritten and whitewashed, I am still fascinated by Victoriana.Bottom line: The Bowler family was *the* wrong choice for this project.  I was very interested in the first half of the first videotape where we were shown how the project came together and how health and safety inspectors almost shut down the project for safety concerns.  But my interest faded once the family got inside of the house.From Day One, it was non-stop whining on the part of Mrs. Bowler.  Even though she's a vegetarian, that lifestyle severely hampered the ability of the viewing audience to see Victorian cuisine in the present day (the local butcher laughed at how she was going to life such a lifestyle in accordance with Victoriana).Another thing regarding Mrs. Bowler's being a vegan: WHY, after the project ended and the family was driven to a highway service station on their way home, did she go to a Burger King and order Whoppers?  A bit hypocritical, eh?And perhaps I shouldn't say the entire family were a bunch of whiners.  The twins - Hilary and Ruth Bowler - were the only level-headed ones in the house.  I do believe the son, Joseph, was too young to have taken part in this project.The fact that the family did not go out to theatres or engage in anything outside of the house until the very end of the project was another pitfall of the show.  There were plenty of ways people amused themselves back in 1900 - besides the local music hall (which, as it was pointed out, was not a place where Victorian parents took their children).  I'm sure such places were still around (or the equivalent of such) in 1999 England.I was especially disappointed with the way the project influenced the Bowlers.  Instead of expressing gratefulness at being able to get to know each other better (unless that was edited out), all the family did was express gratefulness that there are numerous cleaning solutions on the market and that they had their choice of cosmetics and clothes.  How incredibly shallow!The only good to have come out of this was, as Paul and Joyce themselves pointed out, that no one got hurt or sick for the duration of the project.I give credit to the organizers of the project for a great and innovative idea.

551599,A1JKFUUCZRA3Z4,B00004U2K7,Elisabeth,"[3, 3]","This film starts out with a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the 1900s house.  First, a home is selected and stripped of its modern amenities.  Then there's a scout for genuine furniture, appliances and accessories of the 1900s.  And finally, there's selecting a family from over 400 volunteers to live there.The family chosen is the Bowlers (no surprise since the trailor reveals the  family selected).  From the start, I liked their energy.  They seemed real excited to be living in a kind of historical museum where you're actually allowed to touch and use the items you see.  But as time wears on, they soon realize what seemed like a cool idea in theory isn't much so in practice.Laundry is an all-day long ordeal that's even dangerous.  The stove won't heat up without constant supervision and that's dangerous, too.  Basically anything we do today with a press of a button, they have to do manually, which takes twice as long.  And all this while wearing a corset that makes breathing a chore as well.It didn't surprise me that the wife wasn't mentally stimulated by the monotony of chores.  I also wasn't surprised by her struggle to leave behind her modern day right to now serve her husband.  But I was surprised that she was allowed to make a play about the modern woman.  No way would that have been allowed back then.It was interesting, though, when the mom and daughter do their first run of the play.  You hear them shouting about women's rights and then the camera goes back and forth to the maid slaving away for them. The wife did eventually realize the contradiction in this, though.I also found it interesting when the dad started bossing the maid around.

It took days!It's too bad they didn't try this with a few families, so that the family had other people to interact with. There's a lot of boredom felt by the oldest daughter and the mother, which is partly due to the time period and their restricted lifestyle, but probably also due to the fact that they had no one else to interact with.

The idea of ""transporting"" a modern-day family back into the midst of a Victorian home, with all the ""conveniences"" of that time period, is a very compelling idea.For a first effort, the show is not bad. (The other house installments are much better - especially the 1940's house, superb!) The producers obviously learned lessons from this one, and that increased the effectiveness of the others.What is most problematic for the modern-day family is trying to get used to ""primitive"" circumstances while having been raised on contemporary appliances. Its really a no-win situation, while the participants reflect the difficulty of adapting/adjusting, (no shampoo or laundry detergent, uncomfortable undergarments, lack of hot water for baths, etc.) One would think the Victorian era was an unbearable existence for everyone.But what's completely unexplored is how the Victorians were LUXURIATING in the conveniences the Bowlers sniff and sneer at, compared with what had come before! The emergence of the middle class, with significant disposable income, was a relatively new status; being able to afford a large house with indoor plumbing, carpets, kitchen appliances, and even a scullery maid! These people had it good, and they knew it.You'll never get that impression from watching this documentary. To them, the Victorian era was dull, dark, dank, repressive, socially uninteresting, misogynistic, primitive, and worst of all BORING. But that is simply the impression of one very spoiled, contemporary family, not able to move much past their  initial fantasies. This show is much more a commentary on our contemporary values than anything, (which is rather ugly and wasteful in comparison.)The whole ""House"" concept leaps from the minds of a few curious academicians, eager to recreate and foist their imaginations upon these initially wistful people. This is also a major theme of the House series - all the situations and conditions are engineered much like laboratory scientists create artificial environments for their mice experiments. You really get the feeling these people are being subjected to a low-grade form of torture - like, ""Things were TOUGH back then."" (Something like Python's Four Yorkshiremen [...])I really found that aspect very irritating. The later House shows scale this back much better.All in all, this show is very watchable, though disturbing and ultimately unsatisfying. 1940's House is the one you want to watch to really see how well done this genre can be.",3,Nice try at a novel experiment,1286928000,"10 13, 2010",2010,2619,"['was', 'first', 'House', 'series', 'period', 'living', 'experiments', 'very', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'many', 'levels', 'idea', 'transporting', 'modern-day', 'family', 'back', 'midst', 'Victorian', 'home', 'conveniences', 'time', 'period', 'very', 'compelling', 'idea.For', 'first', 'effort', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'other', 'house', 'installments', 'are', 'much', 'better', 'especially', '1940', 'house', 'superb', 'producers', 'obviously', 'learned', 'lessons', 'one', 'increased', 'effectiveness', 'others.What', 'most', 'problematic', 'modern-day', 'family', 'trying', 'get', 'used', 'primitive', 'circumstances', 'having', 'been', 'raised', 'contemporary', 'appliances', 'really', 'no-win', 'situation', 'participants', 'reflect', 'difficulty', 'adapting/adjusting', 'shampoo', 'laundry', 'detergent', 'uncomfortable', 'undergarments', 'lack', 'hot', 'water', 'baths', 'etc', 'One', 'would', 'think', 'Victorian', 'era', 'was', 'unbearable', 'existence', 'what', 'completely', 'unexplored', 'how', 'Victorians', 'were', 'LUXURIATING', 'conveniences', 'Bowlers', 'sniff', 'sneer', 'compared', 'what', 'had', 'come', 'before', 'emergence', 'middle', 'class', 'significant', 'disposable', 'income', 'was', 'relatively', 'new', 'status', 'being', 'able', 'afford', 'large', 'house', 'indoor', 'plumbing', 'carpets', 'kitchen', 'appliances', 'even', 'scullery', 'maid', 'people', 'had', 'good', 'knew', 'it.You', ""'ll"", 'never', 'get', 'impression', 'watching', 'documentary', 'Victorian', 'era', 'was', 'dull', 'dark', 'dank', 'repressive', 'socially', 'uninteresting', 'misogynistic', 'primitive', 'worst', 'BORING', 'simply', 'impression', 'one', 'very', 'spoiled', 'contemporary', 'family', 'not', 'able', 'move', 'much', 'initial', 'fantasies', 'show', 'much', 'more', 'commentary', 'contemporary', 'values', 'anything', 'rather', 'ugly', 'wasteful', 'comparison', 'whole', 'House', 'concept', 'leaps', 'minds', 'few', 'curious', 'academicians', 'eager', 'recreate', 'foist', 'imaginations', 'initially', 'wistful', 'people', 'also', 'major', 'theme', 'House', 'series', 'situations', 'conditions', 'are', 'engineered', 'much', 'laboratory', 'scientists', 'create', 'artificial', 'environments', 'mice', 'experiments', 'really', 'get', 'feeling', 'people', 'are', 'being', 'subjected', 'low-grade', 'form', 'torture', 'Things', 'were', 'TOUGH', 'back', 'then', 'Something', 'Python', 'Four', 'Yorkshiremen', '[', ']', 'really', 'found', 'aspect', 'very', 'irritating', 'later', 'House', 'scale', 'back', 'much', 'better.All', 'show', 'very', 'watchable', 'disturbing', 'ultimately', 'unsatisfying', '1940', 'House', 'one', 'want', 'watch', 'really', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'done', 'genre', 'can', 'be']",The 1900 House:  An Extraordinary Living Experiment VHS

They do exist, and I think the best place to start looking for them are with people who already ""re-enact"" certain periods; among them there will always be a few diehards.  So the way that this show was structured should from the beginning make one expect that it will come nowhere near to being an authentic depiction of life during this period.  Nevertheless, it would have been nice if certain members of the family would have given it a better attempt--namely the lady of the house and the eldest daughter.  In the end I think the most interesting part of the program was the first section where the house is renovated and all of the period furnishings were tracked down (sometimes at extraordinary lengths).  When on day three the mother had a serious, almost juvenile meltdown in front of her children who she should have been serving as an example to, it was clear this was going to be a difficult show to watch.  Sure enough there was much whining and bickering, obstinate refusals sometimes to play the roles expected in a turn of the century household.  Not surprisingly the focus began to narrow down on the (""oppressed"") position that women found themselves in.  This became most intense when the servant Elizabeth was ""hired"".  After awhile she began to actively try to better understand her role by conducting her own research; simultaneously Joyce became more concerned about her own hypocrisy in having hired another woman to be her servant.  So Elizabeth was unexpectedly let go--in other words, while Joyce thought she was ""liberating"" Elizabeth, back in 1900, she would essentially have deprived her of a job and sent looking for another (perhaps worse) position, or a life on the streets.  Moreover, she deprived Elizabeth of her own experience in 1900 House--since she seemed to really be the most keen and authentic disposition of the bunch, this really was a shame.  Much of the last section of the program saw dad and the youngest child (who I suspect was removed from the house for a length of time) completely disappear from the picture, and therewith any sense that 1900 House was an accurate portrayal of the period.  We have absolutely no discussion about what it was like for a middle class head of the household to earn a living during this period--evidently we're supposed to believe that because he could actually leave the house to work he led a carefree and privileged life...  And what about religion?  For many in this period it was still an over-riding influence in their home and social lives; I don't remember it ever being mentioned, and they certainly did not attend church once during the entire three months.  I give this program a three star rating because it does satiate to a certain degree an ""I wish that was me"" desire, but as for authenticity and entertainment it deserves only a two star rating.",3,Somewhat of a disappointment,1305244800,"05 13, 2011",2011,3047,"['order', 'something', 'work', 'really', 'need', 'find', 'more', 'isolated', 'setting', 'enlist', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'disillusioned', 'modern', 'society', 'have', 'minimized', 'ties', 'do', 'exist', 'think', 'best', 'place', 'start', 'looking', 'are', 'people', 'who', 'already', 're-enact', 'certain', 'periods', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'few', 'diehards', 'way', 'show', 'was', 'structured', 'should', 'beginning', 'make', 'one', 'expect', 'will', 'come', 'nowhere', 'being', 'authentic', 'depiction', 'life', 'period', 'Nevertheless', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'nice', 'certain', 'members', 'family', 'would', 'have', 'given', 'better', 'attempt', 'namely', 'lady', 'house', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'end', 'think', 'most', 'interesting', 'part', 'program', 'was', 'first', 'section', 'where', 'house', 'renovated', 'period', 'furnishings', 'were', 'tracked', 'down', 'sometimes', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'When', 'day', 'three', 'mother', 'had', 'serious', 'almost', 'juvenile', 'meltdown', 'front', 'children', 'who', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'serving', 'example', 'was', 'clear', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'difficult', 'show', 'watch', 'Sure', 'enough', 'was', 'much', 'whining', 'bickering', 'obstinate', 'refusals', 'sometimes', 'play', 'roles', 'expected', 'turn', 'century', 'household', 'Not', 'surprisingly', 'focus', 'began', 'narrow', 'down', 'oppressed', 'position', 'women', 'found', 'became', 'most', 'intense', 'when', 'servant', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'hired', 'began', 'actively', 'try', 'better', 'understand', 'role', 'conducting', 'own', 'research', 'simultaneously', 'Joyce', 'became', 'more', 'concerned', 'own', 'hypocrisy', 'having', 'hired', 'woman', 'be', 'servant', 'So', 'Elizabeth', 'was', 'unexpectedly', 'let', 'go', 'other', 'words', 'Joyce', 'thought', 'was', 'liberating', 'Elizabeth', 'back', '1900', 'would', 'essentially', 'have', 'deprived', 'job', 'sent', 'looking', 'perhaps', 'worse', 'position', 'life', 'streets', 'Moreover', 'deprived', 'Elizabeth', 'own', 'experience', '1900', 'House', 'seemed', 'really', 'be', 'most', 'keen', 'authentic', 'disposition', 'bunch', 'really', 'was', 'shame', 'Much', 'last', 'section', 'program', 'saw', 'dad', 'youngest', 'child', 'who', 'suspect', 'was', 'removed', 'house', 'length', 'time', 'completely', 'disappear', 'picture', 'sense', '1900', 'House', 'was', 'accurate', 'portrayal', 'period', 'have', 'absolutely', 'discussion', 'what', 'was', 'middle', 'class', 'head', 'household', 'earn', 'living', 'period', 'evidently', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'could', 'actually', 'leave', 'house', 'work', 'led', 'carefree', 'privileged', 'life', 'what', 'religion', 'many', 'period', 'was', 'still', 'over-riding', 'influence', 'home', 'social', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'ever', 'being', 'mentioned', 'certainly', 'did', 'not', 'attend', 'church', 'once', 'entire', 'three', 'months', 'give', 'program', 'three', 'star', 'rating', 'satiate', 'certain', 'degree', 'wish', 'was', 'desire', 'authenticity', 'entertainment', 'only', 'two', 'star', 'rating']",The 1900 House:  An Extraordinary Living Experiment VHS

Taking a London townhouse that existed in 1900, a host of experts are called in to return it to its original appearance, complete with gas lighting, coal burning stove, turn-of-the-century paintings, clothing, toys, soaps, etc. Then, a 1999 family (the Bowlers) is challenged to live in this house, wearing 1900 clothing using only 1900 technology, for three months. This show is presented on two VHS tapes, each containing two one-hour episodes.I really enjoyed this show. Learning about the house and what went into it in the first episode was interesting, but much more so was watching the family's reaction to the jobs they needed to perform around the house and the limited tools they had to perform the tasks. Emotions range from the joy of parties to the frustration of the mother, when the inability to perform some everyday tasks reduces her to tears. They hire a maid (who, in 1900, would have earned four pence a day for fifteen hours of work!), and then have to deal with the situation of having a domestic.This is a great show, being very educational and yet entertaining.

The refreshing honesty of the Bowler family, and the realness of the project draws you in and you become attached to each &quot;character&quot; even more than you would in a book or movie. Unlike other reality shows, the presence of the family makes the atmosphere loving and supportive, not nasty and backstabbing. Everyone?s in it together, and that?s really nice to watch. But if you are, like myself, interested in history and specifically Victorian history, this movie is a rare gem. You get to see what we have glossed over in our interpretation of the period. I can say that I did over glamorize the lack of technology, and have never even pondered the constraints on diet and hygiene. The documentary truly opens your eyes to living history in a way no book or movie could. It is a little disappointing that all but one family member rejoined modern life for work and school, as I?m sure that somewhat lessened the full force of the experiment.

Will it be fun, like camping? Like being in a play? Or will it be a drag?From the beginning, the producers make it clear that this is more of a thought experiment than research. It was impossible to find a really accurate, correctly working coal stove. They couldn't make everything in the house accurate to 1900, or modern health laws would have to be flouted.  They coudln't take the younger kids out of school, and the husband had to continue his job.So the only ones with a complete 1900's experience are the wife and the teenaged daughter.  (Did anyone else notice that she was 16 and NOT in school? That, as I understand, is normal for Britain but weird for an American middle class family.) Wait a minute, the wife and daughter didn't have an authentic experience either, cuz in real life they would have had people next door to talk to, relatives to visit, etc. etc.  The situation was set up perfectly for the two of them to go bananas over the course of 90 days.I read with puzzlement the reviews that complained about their complaining. Well, of course the wife and oldest daughter complain! They are the only ones whose lives have changed completely, all day and night! The twins, in particular, had very little change. They had each other to talk to, never had to wear corsets, and got to go to school each day. They didn't have to give up socializing as the eldest daughter did and got to see outside friends every day when they changed into 1900's outfits.  As to why they are complaining about corsets, haven't you ever had on an outfit that looked comfy but wasn't after 8 hours? What if you had to wear it for three months more after finding that out?I very much enjoyed watching the degrees of struggle to 1900 s life. If you only have three outfits and wash them once a week, the romance is bound to fade fast. (Thank goodness no one in the house spilled anything or got the flu!)Chamber pots, chickens with black feathers so that they blend with the sooty air, lack of refrigeration and brushing your teeth with straight baking soda also don't fit the image of modern Victoriana.This show cured my hang up with all things Victorian and more than that I cannot ask of any TV show.",4,"Good, and aware of its flaws",1188172800,"08 27, 2007",2007,2343,"['idea', 'find', 'modern', 'British', 'family', 'restore', 'house', 'Victorian', 'middle', 'class', 'condition', 'make', 'family', 'live', 'there', '3', 'months', 'Will', 'be', 'fun', 'camping', 'being', 'play', 'will', 'be', 'drag', 'beginning', 'producers', 'make', 'clear', 'more', 'thought', 'experiment', 'research', 'was', 'impossible', 'find', 'really', 'accurate', 'correctly', 'working', 'coal', 'stove', 'could', ""n't"", 'make', 'everything', 'house', 'accurate', '1900', 'modern', 'health', 'laws', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'flouted', 'coudl', ""n't"", 'take', 'younger', 'kids', 'school', 'husband', 'had', 'continue', 'job.So', 'only', 'ones', 'complete', '1900', 'experience', 'are', 'wife', 'teenaged', 'daughter', 'Did', 'anyone', 'else', 'notice', 'was', '16', 'NOT', 'school', 'understand', 'normal', 'Britain', 'weird', 'American', 'middle', 'class', 'family', 'Wait', 'minute', 'wife', 'daughter', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'authentic', 'experience', 'either', 'cuz', 'real', 'life', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'people', 'next', 'door', 'talk', 'relatives', 'visit', 'etc', 'etc', 'situation', 'was', 'set', 'up', 'perfectly', 'two', 'go', 'bananas', 'course', '90', 'days.I', 'read', 'puzzlement', 'reviews', 'complained', 'complaining', 'Well', 'course', 'wife', 'oldest', 'daughter', 'complain', 'are', 'only', 'ones', 'lives', 'have', 'changed', 'completely', 'day', 'night', 'twins', 'particular', 'had', 'very', 'little', 'change', 'had', 'other', 'talk', 'never', 'had', 'wear', 'corsets', 'got', 'go', 'school', 'day', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'give', 'up', 'socializing', 'eldest', 'daughter', 'did', 'got', 'see', 'outside', 'friends', 'day', 'when', 'changed', '1900', 'outfits', 'why', 'are', 'complaining', 'corsets', 'have', ""n't"", 'ever', 'had', 'outfit', 'looked', 'comfy', 'was', ""n't"", '8', 'hours', 'What', 'had', 'wear', 'three', 'months', 'more', 'finding', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'degrees', 'struggle', '1900', 's', 'life', 'only', 'have', 'three', 'outfits', 'wash', 'once', 'week', 'romance', 'bound', 'fade', 'fast', 'Thank', 'goodness', 'one', 'house', 'spilled', 'anything', 'got', 'flu', 'Chamber', 'pots', 'chickens', 'black', 'feathers', 'blend', 'sooty', 'air', 'lack', 'refrigeration', 'brushing', 'teeth', 'straight', 'baking', 'soda', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'fit', 'image', 'modern', 'Victoriana.This', 'show', 'cured', 'hang', 'up', 'things', 'Victorian', 'more', 'can', 'not', 'ask', 'TV', 'show']",The 1900 House:  An Extraordinary Living Experiment VHS

551612,AMAOS41TZ1V89,B00004U2K7,Price Grisham,"[19, 20]","I thought The 1900 House well done, overall; it revealed both the more elegant aspects of the era (home decor and clothing) and the more awkward aspects (everything painfully basic and time consuming).However, I was startled to see that an intelligent, well-educated family of the 21st century could not function well with mere books, board games, and conversation for entertainment.Perhaps this is because two absolutely central aspects of Victorian life were not included in their lives at all (and perhaps could not have been in this context): Church and social life, which often intersected, were vital to Victorians.Unless you were a very disfunctional Victorian family indeed, this important community connection not only lightened some of the more dreary aspects of life, it was also seen as a moral obligation.  (This could be why the &quot;reality&quot; family found so little to converse about. Was life so boring because this was 1900 or because there was no social interaction at all for this family? That would be boring in any period.)Another point (which the program addressed briefly but perhaps not quite accurately) was domestic service:  Many families in this economic catagory quite often seem to have had one live-in and one &quot;daily&quot; or to have sent their laundry out.  Various memoirs and autobiographies from this period also indicate that some servants, at least, took pride in their profession and were treated with respect by their sometimes struggling employers (Agatha Christie's excellent autobiography would be a good example).  Not all, but some.This program did show us the down side of &quot;the good ol' days&quot; and kept us from romanticizing the period; but it is perhaps also true that we, as modern individualistic people, are losing the ability to appreciate a more community-oriented and simplified life (but who could not immediately empathize with the joyful return to a modern washing machine?!).Thus, The 1900 House seems to have been quite as revealing about the pro's and con's of The 2000 House as it was about the very late Victorian era (when many modern conveniences were only ten or fifteen years away; had this been even The 1913 House, life perhaps would have been more bearable).",4,Revealing look at both contemporary and Victorian mindsets,1060041600,"08 5, 2003",2003,2244,"['thought', '1900', 'House', 'well', 'done', 'overall', 'revealed', 'more', 'elegant', 'aspects', 'era', 'home', 'decor', 'clothing', 'more', 'awkward', 'aspects', 'everything', 'painfully', 'basic', 'time', 'consuming', '.However', 'was', 'startled', 'see', 'intelligent', 'well-educated', 'family', '21st', 'century', 'could', 'not', 'function', 'well', 'mere', 'books', 'board', 'games', 'conversation', 'entertainment.Perhaps', 'because', 'two', 'absolutely', 'central', 'aspects', 'Victorian', 'life', 'were', 'not', 'included', 'lives', 'perhaps', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'context', 'Church', 'social', 'life', 'often', 'intersected', 'were', 'vital', 'Victorians.Unless', 'were', 'very', 'disfunctional', 'Victorian', 'family', 'indeed', 'important', 'community', 'connection', 'not', 'only', 'lightened', 'more', 'dreary', 'aspects', 'life', 'was', 'also', 'seen', 'moral', 'obligation', 'could', 'be', 'why', 'quot', 'reality', 'quot', 'family', 'found', 'so', 'little', 'converse', 'about', 'Was', 'life', 'so', 'boring', 'was', '1900', 'was', 'social', 'interaction', 'family', 'would', 'be', 'boring', 'period', 'point', 'program', 'addressed', 'briefly', 'perhaps', 'not', 'quite', 'accurately', 'was', 'domestic', 'service', 'Many', 'families', 'economic', 'catagory', 'quite', 'often', 'seem', 'have', 'had', 'one', 'live-in', 'one', 'quot', 'daily', 'quot', 'have', 'sent', 'laundry', 'Various', 'memoirs', 'autobiographies', 'period', 'also', 'indicate', 'servants', 'least', 'took', 'pride', 'profession', 'were', 'treated', 'respect', 'sometimes', 'struggling', 'employers', 'Agatha', 'Christie', 'excellent', 'autobiography', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'example', 'Not', 'some.This', 'program', 'did', 'show', 'down', 'side', 'quot', 'good', 'ol', 'days', 'quot', 'kept', 'romanticizing', 'period', 'perhaps', 'also', 'true', 'modern', 'individualistic', 'people', 'are', 'losing', 'ability', 'appreciate', 'more', 'community-oriented', 'simplified', 'life', 'who', 'could', 'not', 'immediately', 'empathize', 'joyful', 'return', 'modern', 'washing', 'machine', '.Thus', '1900', 'House', 'have', 'been', 'quite', 'revealing', 'pro', 'con', ""'s"", '2000', 'House', 'was', 'very', 'late', 'Victorian', 'era', 'when', 'many', 'modern', 'conveniences', 'were', 'only', 'ten', 'fifteen', 'years', 'away', 'had', 'been', 'even', '1913', 'House', 'life', 'perhaps', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'bearable']",The 1900 House:  An Extraordinary Living Experiment VHS

Why would you volunteer to be a part of a reality tv show where women wear corsets, didn't have the right to vote and treated their servants poorly, and then whine about it when you get on TV? Better yet, why would you want to watch it? After enjoying 1940's house I rented 1900 house only to find it not quite up to par. The problem with the series was not the setting...It was the Bowlers themselves. The Bowlers, particularly the wife and the eldest daughter were a bunch of whining wimps. Instead of throwing themselves into their roles, they continue to whine, complain and grouse about the things they 'do not have' and how 'unfair' everything is. Of course its unfair, this is the 1900's!I was disappointed in Mrs. Bowler. Her vegetarianism and distaste for meat, cooking, and the hiring of a maid, meant we missed out on seeing some interesting Victorian era cuisine and we also missed seeing her develop some proficiency in creating meals from that era. There is only so much I could listen to her anti-meat ranting and see the insipid meatless dishes she cooked up. (To be fair, one time she made sausages, but only after whining about 'how disgusting' the meat provided by the butcher was). What's the point of watching a show about the Victorian era if all we get are dishes anyone can make in the modern era? (Spaghetti, vegetable soup etc.)Ms. bowler's anti-corset rantings also took up at least twenty-minutes of screen time. Yes we know corsets are awful, unhealthy etc.  The teen daughter's whining and complaining also got on my nerves. Oh my god! I have to share a room with my two sisters! The sky is falling! Get over yourself and take advantage of the opportunity to learn something new- such as piano, writing, sewing, quilting etc.The husband character was absent a lot, and the best character, I felt was the maid.3 stars.

When you see Victorian times portrayed in the movies, it is quite misleading.  It's portrayed as a quiet and gentler time, where women had a lot of time to learn to play the piano, visit friends or do needlepoint.  Maybe this was true of the wealthy, but for most women, the Victorian era was much more difficult.  There was much illness and disease and death especially amongst the children and many Victorian women were obsessed with death because it permeated their daily lives.  Housekeeping was time consuming and would start from sunrise to sunset. I truly enjoyed how the family really slipped into their roles as a Victorian family.  It was interesting to see the growing resentment in Joyce because she had to bear the brunt of living in the 1900 House.  I felt that many women of the era probably felt the same way, which is why women began to enter the workforce at that time.  Paul seemed to easily slip into his role as Master of the House as he orders the maid around the house.  This was a great history lesson to remind us that women and household appliances have come a long way since 1900.

The Bowlers agreed to spend three months  living the life of a lower middle-class family of the late 19th century,  without modern conveniences, in an authentically reconstructed Victorian  house.  In the premiere, we see the producers' search for an appropriate  house, the hunt for authentic furnishing and housewares, and a construction  crew's removal of electricity, central heat, indoor toilet, etc., as they  turn a London row home of 1999 into The 1900 House.  We also see various  families' auditions.  In episode 2, the Bowler family is outfitted with  their 1900 clothing, and is greeted at their new home by the museum curator  in charge of the house's restoration.  We witness their first week in The  1900 House.  By part 3, Victorian life is starting to wear down the  family's composure -- especially the women's -- so the mother places an  advert for a housemaid.  The maid agrees to abide by the rules: cleaning  will be done using late-19th-century technology.  In need of a break, much  of the family visits a public baths -- except the women, who are not  welcome there.  Part four presents the end of the Bowlers' stay in the  house, and sums up.  Utterly fascinating and always entertaining.  It's  sort of what you'd get if you crossed THE REAL WORLD with UPSTAIRS  DOWNSTAIRS.

When the participants break the rules they point out how things would have really been in 1900.  It's ludicrous to suggest that the producers could have created more context for the show.  To do so - to create lavish social conditions (more participants, social gatherings, etc.) - would have been well beyond the scope and budget of the project.Viewer response to this show versus Colonial House is also revealing. 1900 House participants broke the rules all the time - they bought shampoo, they treated the maid better than a Victorian family would have, etc.  More importantly, the father and the children had lives outside the home in the modern era.  Essentially, these people had it easy compared to Colonial House who were mandated to have zero contact with anything remotely modern.It seems that critics of Colonial House have a political agenda.  Any and all criticisms about participants breaking the rules and this somehow ruining the show is mindless.  Living as they did in the past, whether it be the US colonial era or 1900 Victorian London, would be misery for the vast majority of people living in the western world.  People aren't robots.  If you want a show where all the actors appear to follow the rules watch a fictional drama.  But then, all you'll be watching are professional actors playing a part.  You won't be seeing people live, suffer and even enjoy the lifestyles of the past - which is the whole point of making these programs in the first place.Last word: 1900 House, like Colonial House, is a great television for adults and children alike.

Hutter ""v_rh""","[1, 1]","There have been so many changes in the world in the last 112 years so a series attempting to have a modern family really experience what it was like living as a typical middle-class family in England in 1900 was extremely interesting.  Things we take for granted today did not exist in 1900 and it is no wonder that the family experienced culture shock in the three-month social experiment.The 1900 House along with Frontier House are my favorites in the genre of having modern people live as people did in past generations.  Life was hard, confining and held dangers that no long exist due to improvements in sanitation, diet, safety regulations and improved knowledge.  Modern conveniences enable people, especially women, pursue other interests and activities outside cooking and cleaning.I certainly don't believe that living in the 1900s takes one back to a simpler time; there is a reason our life expectancies are much better today and people are healthier and happier.If you missed this British Channel 4 production when it was shown on PBS, I recommend you try to locate either a VHS or DVD of the series.

551621,A1PB4CAWL8T413,B00004U2K7,Wayne Steinhardt,"[7, 9]","Take a modern London house.  Remove all the modern appliances.  Rip out the electricity.  Take out the indoor bathroom.  Any products that weren't around in 1900 has to go.  Install gas lights, a range, old fashioned laundry facilities and furnishings from 1900.  Now, have a family move in live there for three months.  For those three months, they can only use appliances that were available in 1900, eat foods that were available in 1900 and engage in activities that were popular in 1900.  That's the premise of the 1900 House.Just from watching this video set, you will be amazed at the conveniences that we take for granted.  You won't beleive the amount of work that went into maintaining a house in 1900, from the laundry (a never ending task -- you can't just throw it in the machine), to the cooking (on a range that didn't always work right and with a limited selection of foods), to the cleaning (it's difficult keeping the place clean without an electric vacuum cleaner -- especially with all the rugs).On this tape you watch the Bowler family of London live in the 1900 house for three months.  Mr. Bowler (a marine), must learn to shave with a cutthroat razor.  Mrs. Bowler has to learn how to run the household.  The twin girls must learn to work around the house.  And the youngest boy has problems of his own when the family finds he doesn't like any of the foods available in 1900.Little things that we take for granted are sorely missed in the 1900 House.Sheets cannot be just thrown into the washing machine.  There is none.  They have to be boiled and pressed using an old fashioned hand presser.Of course, there being no refrigerator in the house, the shopping must be done daily.  You can't keep perishables in the house very long.Needless to say, cooking was a major headache.  No microwaves, not even a normal oven.  Controlling the temperature on the range they had was an incredible task.While they did have a flush toilet out in the back, there was none in the house.  That meant keeping a chamber pot by the bed (Ugh!)Boredom was even a factor.  Many of the things you and I like to do for entertainment weren't available.  You couldn't read a book printed after 1900, since they weren't available yet (that would really reduce Amazon's inventory!).  No television, no radio, very few periodicals.  The only form of contact with anyone outside was by the daily mail delivery.This series was a real eye-opener to me.  It gave me a greater awareness of how far we have come technologically in the last hundred years, and gave me a better understanding of the life that my grandparents and great-grandparents lived.I can only hope that if PBS does a series a hundred years from now called ""The 2000 House,""  we don't seem as technologically backward to the viewers then as the 1900 House seems to us.",5,A wonderful look back at a time I'd rather not revisit  :),978998400,"01 9, 2001",2001,2827,"['Take', 'modern', 'London', 'house', 'Remove', 'modern', 'appliances', 'Rip', 'electricity', 'Take', 'out', 'indoor', 'bathroom', 'products', 'were', ""n't"", 'around', '1900', 'go', 'Install', 'gas', 'lights', 'range', 'old', 'fashioned', 'laundry', 'facilities', 'furnishings', '1900', 'Now', 'have', 'family', 'move', 'live', 'three', 'months', 'three', 'months', 'can', 'only', 'use', 'appliances', 'were', 'available', '1900', 'foods', 'were', 'available', '1900', 'engage', 'activities', 'were', 'popular', '1900', 'premise', '1900', 'House.Just', 'watching', 'video', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'amazed', 'conveniences', 'take', 'granted', 'wo', ""n't"", 'beleive', 'amount', 'work', 'went', 'maintaining', 'house', '1900', 'laundry', 'never', 'ending', 'task', 'ca', ""n't"", 'just', 'throw', 'machine', 'cooking', 'range', 'did', ""n't"", 'always', 'work', 'right', 'limited', 'selection', 'foods', 'cleaning', 'difficult', 'keeping', 'place', 'clean', 'electric', 'vacuum', 'cleaner', 'especially', 'rugs', '.On', 'tape', 'watch', 'Bowler', 'family', 'London', 'live', '1900', 'house', 'three', 'months', 'Mr.', 'Bowler', 'marine', 'must', 'learn', 'shave', 'cutthroat', 'razor', 'Mrs.', 'Bowler', 'learn', 'how', 'run', 'household', 'twin', 'girls', 'must', 'learn', 'work', 'house', 'youngest', 'boy', 'problems', 'own', 'when', 'family', ""n't"", 'like', 'foods', 'available', '1900.Little', 'things', 'take', 'granted', 'are', 'sorely', 'missed', '1900', 'House.Sheets', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'just', 'thrown', 'washing', 'machine', 'none', 'have', 'be', 'boiled', 'pressed', 'using', 'old', 'fashioned', 'hand', 'presser.Of', 'course', 'being', 'refrigerator', 'house', 'shopping', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'daily', 'ca', ""n't"", 'keep', 'perishables', 'house', 'very', 'long.Needless', 'say', 'cooking', 'was', 'major', 'headache', 'microwaves', 'not', 'even', 'normal', 'oven', 'Controlling', 'temperature', 'range', 'had', 'was', 'incredible', 'task.While', 'did', 'have', 'flush', 'toilet', 'back', 'was', 'none', 'house', 'meant', 'keeping', 'chamber', 'pot', 'bed', 'Ugh', 'Boredom', 'was', 'even', 'factor', 'Many', 'things', 'like', 'do', 'entertainment', 'were', ""n't"", 'available', 'could', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'printed', '1900', 'were', ""n't"", 'available', 'yet', 'would', 'really', 'reduce', 'Amazon', 'inventory', 'television', 'radio', 'very', 'few', 'periodicals', 'only', 'form', 'contact', 'anyone', 'outside', 'was', 'daily', 'mail', 'delivery.This', 'series', 'was', 'real', 'eye-opener', 'gave', 'greater', 'awareness', 'how', 'far', 'have', 'come', 'technologically', 'last', 'hundred', 'years', 'gave', 'better', 'understanding', 'life', 'grandparents', 'great-grandparents', 'lived.I', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'PBS', 'series', 'hundred', 'years', 'now', 'called', '2000', 'House', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'technologically', 'viewers', 'then', '1900', 'House']",The 1900 House:  An Extraordinary Living Experiment VHS
