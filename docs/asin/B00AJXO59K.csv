I really don't know what the correct term should be. The cast was put together very well and I really don't know what in the hell convinced them to participate in this crap, they had to be mislead on the outcome of what this will turn out to be. But then again, don't most actors and actress view their work before it goes out mainstream? Anyways getting back to the point- the stories could've been elaborated on more. At first glance, they all have potential. Instead of dragging them out only to never finish them is torture.The story lines never came full circle so no loose ends were tied up. Actually, the entire film is a LOOSE END!And it just went off. Just like that! Wow! Definitely a big bust that makes me look at the actors differently.

I really love supporting indie films, especially African American ones, so while i dont wanna harshly judge the directing/production. I must admitt this was not excellent or even good (in my opinion).This was promoted as a film, not a collection of short films that do not come together at all. I'm shocked by the popular Black Actors/Actress who actually participated in these short films, which were boring and prolonged. Ive seen tons of short films, and these were not up to standard, they left much to be desired.I wrote this review to help others save there hard earned money, dont be tricked by the trailers/promotions are familiar faces.
