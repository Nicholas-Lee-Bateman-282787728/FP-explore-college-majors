744687,A1LF1VMH9YCTLE,B00008L3WX,"AussieGal ""Kylie""","[54, 55]","I won't go into detail about the breakdown of the workout as others have more than adequately done this - I wanted to address some of the UNFAIR CRITICISM.Firstly those who say there is no instruction (especially the dance section at the end) may not have used the very comprehensive menu. Choose the 'play all' option and skip until you find the 'teaching combination' sections.  The dance combination is taught in 4 sections - each move is shown in slow motion with excellent voice over instruction then goes 'up tempo' and shown in the speed that the end dance has.  These segments can be repeated over and over until you 'get it'.I have no dance experience and the grace and poise of a lame duck but it only took me no more than 5 attempts to learn most of it (by replaying each section).  I have had longer learning periods with my Cathe Friedrich step workouts!  Why do you want a dvd that you can do when you first put it in? That is just a waste of money as you will get bored quickly - I want to be able to progress.Another criticism was the lack of explanation of ballet terminology - rubbish!  DVD comes with a booklet that shows each one and explains, and the glossary on the dvd does the same. As Peter explains, you can go to that glossary at any time in the workout if you need more help with positions.  Remember these people had years of training to get the bodies they have, it is crazy to think you will have their grace and mastery of the movements with one workout!  But with many uses of this workout you will come close, the instruction is EXCELLENT and the closest thing to one-on-one instruction you will get.And to address one other unfair comment - you CAN skip through sections and program any/all parts of the workout USE THE MENU!!I'd rate this workout 11/10 and only wish they would release no. 3.  A lovely change of pace from high impact aerobics and step for me - but still a challenge - especially if you do the 'dance' at the end twice!A beautifully produced dvd, excellent quality, great menu system (especially being able to choose the music) and voice over instruction is calm and soothing to listen to.

I enjoy this DVD though I find it more of a taxing than a challenging workout- it's more strength than cardio.  The music, setting, and dancers are all great.  One of the female ballet dancers is so incredibly flexible that it's motivating.It isn't an intimidating routine either.  I have no real knowledge of ballet- I didn't buy Volume 1 because the reviews for Volume 2 seemed better, and I haven't done ballet since I was about 5 years old.  I'm also not particularly coorinated but this didn't seem to be too much of a problem.  There are moments where detailed instruction wouldn't have hurt and I definitely rewind it to try to figure out some movements.  However, that just goes with the territory of ballet- it takes practice.  Granted, the elegance of ballet comes with time so mostly I started out quite clumsily but it's coming together.  Overall, a very good DVD.

744690,AFJGFW2WW3K68,B00008L3WX,Glass,"[3, 3]","You know the drill-- ever since the 80s, workout videos are either filled with a ponytailed blonde bouncing around and barking at you in her ""boot camp"" OR a ponytailed blonde chanting ""om"" as she sweetly beckons you to open up your heart chakra. If neither one of these is your style, you must get this workout. I've been working out regularly for about 13 years and have seen far too many videos and DVDs than I care to admit, and this is the only one that seems ""grown up"" to me. It's shot beautifully, the music is lovely, and the gentlemen are, ahem, pleasing to the eye. If you're injured, this workout is a boon. It teaches you to use your body to increase strength and flexibility while avoiding injury, and the floor exercises are especially useful if you have a bad knee or are recovering from a physical malaise.Why 4 stars? I wouldn't recommend this workout as a way to lose weight, per se. I add it to my normal regime to lengthen and strengthen, but in and of itself, there simply isn't enough to raise your heart rate to an intensity required for results for people who need to lose more than 20 lbs. However, it absolutely will strengthen everything and aid in increasing your metabolism through muscle toning. It's also fun to do and makes me feel pretty. So, if you need to lose more than 20 pounds, I recommend doing something a little more intense and cardiovascular in addition to this workout.However, I think everyone could benefit from this fun and pretty dance-based workout.

The rapid movements get your heart beating faster, but the graceful flowing movements make you feel more relaxed.The narration made me feel very relaxed, so the entire first two-thirds of the second workout seemed more relaxing and centering than invigorating. The exercises begin with a warm-up and progress to dance steps, floor exercises for the abs, legs and arms. During the exercises you do have to count for yourself and there are bonus exercises later in the program that you can add in to your own routine.While I found it much easier to follow the first DVD, the second DVD has much more complex moves and you need a much higher degree of intense concentration and precise balance to enjoy the exercises. Having some split-sole sneakers might help with the jumping, but you can do most of the workout in bare feet or with ballet slippers.The booklet in the second DVD shows more of the exercises and has a glossary for Turnout, Demi Pli&eacute;, Grand Pli&eacute;, Releve, Tendu, D&eacute;gag&eacute;, Pass&eacute;, Fondu, Grand Battement, Changement de pieds, Pas de Basque and Piqu&eacute; Arabesque. On the DVD, all of these are shown in detail in a section in the special features.After trying the workout a few times, you may also want to personalize it and there is a way to select specific exercises and then play them all at once for your own personalized routine. The sections you can choose from include:Upper BodyLower BodyComgined MovementStretchesAbdominal StrengtheningFloor Barre SupineFloor Barre Side LyingFloor Barre PronePli&eacute; & TenduD&eacute;gag&eacute;Pass&eacute; & FonduGrand Battement & Little JumpsReverenceAn inspirational ""Born to Dance"" segment features all the dancers in their daily life and there is also a behind-the-scenes bonus feature as well as a number of promos for fitness studios in New York. What do dancers do after exercising? The first DVD gives a more detailed look into the dancers' lives, but this DVD has a combined section that briefly explores the dancers' interests when not dancing.
