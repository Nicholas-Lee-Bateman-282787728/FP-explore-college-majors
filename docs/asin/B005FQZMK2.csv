We own all the regular editions of the What's in the Bible series and I thought it would be a good addition to our collection.  I was not disappointed.  I learned things I didn't know or hadn't thought about from this DVD about Christmas.  It was a great buy and I have recommended it over and over.,5,Great Buy!,1388966400,"01 6, 2014",2014,327,"['bought', 'kids', 'own', 'regular', 'editions', 'What', 'Bible', 'series', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'addition', 'collection', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'learned', 'things', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'had', ""n't"", 'thought', 'about', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'was', 'great', 'buy', 'have', 'recommended']",Buck Denver Asks...Why Do We Call It Christmas?
