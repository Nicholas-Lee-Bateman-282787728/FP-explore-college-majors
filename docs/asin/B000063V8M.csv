The final result could be considered acceptable IF you understand what it is you are getting.""Tarzan & Jane"" looks exactly as you would expect a TV cartoon to look like, so you will not be getting any of the spectacular deep canvas animation used on the 1999 original. You won't even get animation that is better than ""Cinderella II: Dreams Come True"", but on par with ""The Hunchback Of Notre Dame II"".  It easy not to be judgemental on the quality, or at least easier. This is because it is not an original production like the other DTV sequels in where the film makers claim that they try to make the sequel look like the original.The story, has flaws, but it doesn't matter for the kids. They will love it no matter what.Voice actors are matched close enough to the orginal. With the exception of Terk and sometimes Jane. The replacements of Terk (the ape) does not sound at all like Rosie O'Donnell's take on the character. While Jane does sound like Minnie Driver at times, but some times goes off track a little bit.Over all, I'd say this one is better for parents to sit through than Cinderella II or The Hunchback II.

On the plus side, it's good training for their animators.But CINDERELLA II was awful. HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME II was okay (the original voices is a big plus). I think the most succesful was LADY AND THE TRAMP II - even though the voices of the established characters were atrocious and Lady is reduced to a bit part.TARZAN & JANE is strung together from episodes of the syndicated television cartoon, with new connecting material. Oddly the DVD, at least, is in a widescreen format .The special edition DVD of Disney's TARZAN goes to great lengths to discuss the care and work that went into its making. But nothing of that scale is here. None of the voices are voiced by the original actors. The character of Tantor sounds like Wayne Knight, but his name is absent from the credits so I can only surmise it is the work of the talented mimic Jim Cummings - who is credited.When the original Disney's TARZAN was in theaters director Spike Lee complained of the absence of black characters. My take was that Tarzan's presence in this isolated part of the jungle was a fluke, and he had seen no people before - neither black nor white. But here it seems everybody who knew Jane in England shows up, plus there is a regular ship captain and a man who runs a local trading post - all are white.There are many other discrepancies with the original film - many things are just out of character.TARZAN & JANE is getting a heavy advertsiing push with national TV ads and billboards in major cities. Yet a legitimate Disney animated feature was released to DVD (for the first time) and home video the very same day with no fanfare whatsoever. That film is the much superior THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE. So it seems Disney 's main interest in these video sequels is sales - just more ""product"" - not quality.Ultimately, I feel Disney does itself no favor by cheapening its precious legacy with these cheap knock-offs.",2,Mixed Emotions,1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,2001,"['have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'Disney', 'series', 'direct-to-video', 'sequels', 'animated', 'features', 'plus', 'side', 'good', 'training', 'animators.But', 'CINDERELLA', 'II', 'was', 'awful', 'HUNCHBACK', 'OF', 'NOTRE', 'DAME', 'II', 'was', 'okay', 'original', 'voices', 'big', 'plus', 'think', 'most', 'succesful', 'was', 'LADY', 'THE', 'TRAMP', 'II', 'even', 'voices', 'established', 'characters', 'were', 'atrocious', 'Lady', 'reduced', 'bit', 'part.TARZAN', 'JANE', 'strung', 'together', 'episodes', 'syndicated', 'television', 'cartoon', 'new', 'connecting', 'material', 'Oddly', 'DVD', 'least', 'widescreen', 'format', '.The', 'special', 'edition', 'DVD', 'Disney', 'TARZAN', 'great', 'lengths', 'discuss', 'care', 'work', 'went', 'making', 'nothing', 'scale', 'here', 'None', 'voices', 'are', 'voiced', 'original', 'actors', 'character', 'Tantor', 'Wayne', 'Knight', 'name', 'absent', 'credits', 'can', 'only', 'surmise', 'work', 'talented', 'mimic', 'Jim', 'Cummings', 'who', 'credited.When', 'original', 'Disney', 'TARZAN', 'was', 'theaters', 'director', 'Spike', 'Lee', 'complained', 'absence', 'black', 'characters', 'take', 'was', 'Tarzan', 'presence', 'isolated', 'part', 'jungle', 'was', 'fluke', 'had', 'seen', 'no', 'people', 'black', 'white', 'here', 'everybody', 'who', 'knew', 'Jane', 'England', 'up', 'regular', 'ship', 'captain', 'man', 'who', 'local', 'trading', 'post', 'are', 'are', 'many', 'other', 'discrepancies', 'original', 'film', 'many', 'things', 'are', 'just', 'character.TARZAN', 'JANE', 'getting', 'heavy', 'advertsiing', 'push', 'national', 'TV', 'ads', 'billboards', 'major', 'cities', 'legitimate', 'Disney', 'animated', 'feature', 'was', 'released', 'DVD', 'first', 'time', 'home', 'video', 'very', 'same', 'day', 'fanfare', 'whatsoever', 'film', 'much', 'superior', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'MOUSE', 'DETECTIVE', 'Disney', 'main', 'interest', 'video', 'sequels', 'sales', 'just', 'more', 'product', 'not', 'quality.Ultimately', 'feel', 'Disney', 'favor', 'cheapening', 'precious', 'legacy', 'cheap', 'knock-offs']",N/A

This movie is ANYTHING but cool. It is a sad and sorry disaster that was plainly done only to cheat Disney-loving saps out of their good, hard-earned money. This worthless piece of junk belongs in the trash or under a nice cold beverage glass as a coaster. I had NO fun watching this film; the entire time I wished it only to end, and as soon as possible! ""Cinderella II"" was INFINITELY better than this!! At least there the animation was decent, it had HUMOR, and there were some multi-dimensional characters with clear messages. This movie is just plain stupid.The animation and voice talent are HORRIBLE through and through. It is nothing more than three particularly bad Saturday morning cartoon episodes mashed together incoherently and labeled as a ""sequel."" This is by far THE WORST Disney sequel to date, and I cannot stress that enough! Please don't subject yourself to the torture by watching it, it will only sicken you. It's almost impossible to believe that the Disney studios who produced spectacular old movies like ""Beauty & the Beast,"" ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""Lady & the Tramp,"" and countless others could be the same Disney studios who sunk so low as to churn out this dull, soulless piece of garbage.If, even after reading all this, you STILL make the mistake of buying it on DVD, be warned! Do NOT under any circumstances watch the Special Features. Mandy Moore's cornball claims to be ""expressing herself as a character when she sings the song for a Disney movie,"" or some such fluffed-up nonsense about always wanting to be a Disney character will make you gag. Not only is the song she sings mortifyingly awful, it only plays softly in the background during the final scene: meaning she can hardly be heard. So much for dreaming of a role in a Disney film. She sure picked a winner to be in. (Note the sarcasm. If I actually meant this movie was a winner, I'd be checking myself into a mental hospital right now. I know good movies. This is not one of them.)Sound too extreme a ""bad review"" for a kids' movie? Nah. Not to a 16-year-old who will love animation forever and ever. Why do they have to go and spoil it like this? Not as though the original ""Tarzan"" was anything great, either. Tarzan himself isn't exactly an endearing ape-man with his fake-looking hair and square-ish knuckles (a predecessor to the ridiculously angular ones found in ""Atlantis,"" which was a good movie otherwise?). And as for Jane....well, let's put it this way. It BAFFLES me as to how anyone could like her.

696178,A2UQIIJ2CD8REE,B000063V8M,Monty Moonlight,"[0, 0]","Disney's ""Tarzan and Jane"" is not a real direct-to-video feature sequel to their fantastic theatrical release, ""Tarzan"" (for something more along those lines, check out the somewhat excellent midquel, ""Tarzan 2""). Instead, ""Tarzan and Jane"" is deviously packaged and sold as an all new feature, but it is not. Not really. This is the key factor you must know when considering to purchase ""Tarzan and Jane"". What is it really? Well, have you ever seen those special episodes of old sitcoms in which the characters just reminisce about past episodes? They're called ""clip shows"". Well, like a handful of other films released direct-to-video by Disney, ""Tarzan and Jane"" is one of those releases that is similar to watching a clip show, but instead of clips, we're getting flashbacks to full episodes of the Disney animated television show ""The Legend of Tarzan"", a series based on their animated feature but which was less easy to find during its TV run than most of their other animated shows. I did manage to catch a few episodes though, and if memory serves, it was pretty good, but I don't think the three episodes on this disc represent the ""Best Of"".Instead of serving children and adult fans together by releasing the ""The Legend of Tarzan"" animated series in a complete series set, Disney got greedy again here and went for the babysitter buck, linking three so-so episodes that aren't connected at all with a weak wraparound story of Jane trying to figure out how best to celebrate her first anniversary of marriage to Tarzan. It definitely brings to mind the old ""Hercules: Zero to Hero"" release that has since only come out on VHS and was exactly the same sort of presentation we are getting here instead of a truly new sequel. The wraparound animation, once again, is sub par, though probably better than what we saw in Herc's release. Luckily, the actual TV episodes that provide the bulk of the ""feature"" presentation are slightly better at typical Disney television animation levels. The leaf shadow effect used can be a bit annoying at times though. The voicing in the episodes sounds better than the wraparound material too, though none of the original cast returned for the TV series. The three episodes from the show we get in this flashback format are ""Tarzan and the British Invasion"", ""Tarzan and the Volcanic Diamond Mine"" and ""Tarzan and the Flying Ace"". British Invasion tells of 3 old friends of Jane coming to visit and being shocked and appalled at her new, wild lifestyle and wildman husband. Volcanic Diamond Mine is about two greedy men who come to the jungle in search of diamonds and who hire Tarzan as a guide. The Flying Ace is about another old friend of Jane's coming to visit, this time a male. Tarzan distrusts him but worries his feelings might be clouded by jealousy. All three tales are just ""okay"" stories, and it would seem the only link between them is an almost secondary focus on Tarzan's desire to please Jane and be a good husband. A negative in grouping these particular stories are the similarities between them, some of which I won't mention because they'd seem like spoilers.The overall DVD is decent, enhanced widescreen and all that (though, now that I think about it, that probably means the TV show segments have been cropped, ugh), and it includes Fast Play and 3 extras. Proving this DVD was just aimed at the ""just buy it to entertain your kids"" audience and not a wider scale of Disney or Tarzan fans, the 3 bonus features are a ""choose your own adventure"" type Tarzan story, a build a treehouse game, and a weak behind the scenes look at Mandy Moore's recording of the forgettable original song for this film, ""Singing to the Song of Life"". I thought at least I was getting a Mandy Moore video here, but it's just some blasting of the song with bits of Mandy breaking in and talking about it here and there, so not even a proper music video is included. It's too bad the bonus features didn't also include some bonus TV show episodes (but that might have given away the big secret?) or at least some classic Disney shorts, but what can you expect on a release such as this. Bottom line, it's our only way to get any episodes (even if they're not the best) of the Tarzan animated series right now, so a hardcore Disney fanatic like myself pretty much has to get this for his/her collection. BUT, Disney, please, knock off this packaging episodes as an original movie crap. It does not reflect well on you, and it's definitely PART of the reason Disney direct-to-video releases got such a bad reputation over the years (which is too bad, because there ARE some good ones out there). Stop sitting on your television shows and give them proper releases, and follow through. You were on the right track for a while there with DuckTales, TaleSpin, Darkwing, Rescue Rangers, the Gummi Bears, Gargoyles, and Lizzie McGuire, but you couldn't finish releasing even ONE of those shows? What's up with that? Much less popular shows get full releases from other studios. Give a little back to your fans and the public opinion of the Disney Company will start to go up again. It's not really a great idea to alienate your most hardcore fans just to please the masses. The hardcore fans are the ones who really keep you alive in the public consciousness when you need it the most. And I'm not letting the consumer off the hook here either. People, in this information age, stop buying DVDs you know NOTHING about and then complaining about them. Do a little research before you drop a 20 on a new movie if you're the type to get very upset if you're not pleased. I say this for YOUR benefit, not just because I hate to read clueless reviews. Anyway, 3 stars out of 5 because the show was a good show, and one way or another, you at least get three episodes of it out of this DVD.",3,Let's judge this one fairly...,1308528000,"06 20,
