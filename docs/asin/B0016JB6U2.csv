However, Amy's routines are not for anyone who has little imagination or the time to take the effort to learn something different and take on a challenge. The payoff is exhilerating. I also like the ""Hi Lo Knockout"" workout, which is similar in length, but more aerobic. She is probably the most diverse instructor out there these days; her videos never looked rushed or prosaic. I look forward to all her new ideas.",5,Fantastic workout.,1232928000,"01 26, 2009",2009,482,"['love', 'workout', 'keep', 'rotation', 'least', 'once', 'week', 'However', 'Amy', 'routines', 'are', 'not', 'anyone', 'who', 'little', 'imagination', 'time', 'take', 'effort', 'learn', 'something', 'different', 'take', 'challenge', 'payoff', 'exhilerating', 'also', 'Hi', 'Lo', 'Knockout', 'workout', 'similar', 'length', 'more', 'aerobic', 'probably', 'most', 'diverse', 'instructor', 'there', 'days', 'videos', 'never', 'looked', 'rushed', 'prosaic', 'look', 'forward', 'new', 'ideas']",Amy Bento: In the Ring Cardio Kickboxing

I wanted to like it, but some of the moves just don't flow where I found myself improvising with memorized Cathe stuff. The music is not too motivating either and when it was about half through I felt a bit bored wanting it to be over. I was looking forward to the med ball intervals, but didn't like them all that much either. I will give it another shot, but I'm rating it only 3 stars.

The workout is intermediate to advanced level.

It's definitely a more high-intermediate/advanced workout, but you can certainly modify many of the moves.As with most of Amy's workouts, there is not a lot of breakdown of the moves, so it took me a few times to get each segment of the workout down pat.  Now that I know it, I appreciate the fact that the workout moves quickly, without a lot of stopping to break it down.  When you're learning it, you might have to be patient and use your rewind button a bit.The music is great, the kick boxing moves are fun, and Amy's great personality shines through!",5,One of my favorite workouts!,1227052800,"11 19, 2008",2008,627,"['have', 'Amy', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'one', 'favorites', 'definitely', 'more', 'high-intermediate/advanced', 'workout', 'can', 'certainly', 'modify', 'many', 'moves.As', 'most', 'Amy', 'workouts', 'not', 'lot', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'took', 'few', 'times', 'get', 'segment', 'workout', 'down', 'pat', 'Now', 'know', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'workout', 'moves', 'quickly', 'lot', 'stopping', 'break', 'down', 'When', ""'re"", 'learning', 'might', 'have', 'be', 'patient', 'use', 'rewind', 'button', 'bit.The', 'music', 'great', 'kick', 'boxing', 'moves', 'are', 'fun', 'Amy', 'great', 'personality', 'shines']",Amy Bento: In the Ring Cardio Kickboxing
1153536,A19XC6Z95GK5AB,B0016JB6U2,"Nancy Loderick ""Internet strategist""","[2, 2]","I love Amy Bento workouts.  This one does not disappoint.  In The Ring consists of 4 cardio kickboxing routines, with medicine ball intervals following each routine.Amy's truly shines at choreography and music choice.  I own all of Amy's DVDs and have yet to see her use the same move or the same song in any of them.  Most other instructors, like Cathe Friedrich and Tracey Staehle, tend to have favorite moves that show up in a lot of their DVDs.What I loved about this DVD:**I get a great workout with low impact.  I don't know what it is about the moves that Amy puts together, but I always feel worked out after doing them.**the music by BJ Howe.  Even though the songs aren't top 40 hits, they are catchy and have a good, driving beat.**Amy's engaging personality.  She is genuinely enjoying herself and I feel like I'm in a live class with her.**the interesting choreography.  I like complex choreography since it makes me think and saves me from boredom if I frequently do the DVD.**several premixes for when you're want a good workout, but don't have time to do the full workout.What was a little confusing about this DVD:**the 4th routine was rather complex and long.  I found myself focusing so much on trying to get the moves down, that my heart rate wasn't very high.  I think if I did this DVD more often, I'd have the move down and could focus more on working hard.Please note that this DVD is for advanced exercisers.  Amy doesn't talk too much about form, nor does she show a lot of modifications. You really need to know your body and your limitations.Amy doesn't give a lot of breakdown of the moves and since her moves are pretty unique, it may take a while to pick them up.  She also tends to cue at the same time she starts a move, which can be confusing for some.These characteristics are great for me since I'm an advanced exerciser and have no patience with modifications or long explanations of moves.",5,"Fun cardio kickboxing, combined with medicine ball intervals",1277942400,"07 1, 2010",2010,1927,"['love', 'Amy', 'Bento', 'one', 'not', 'disappoint', 'Ring', '4', 'cardio', 'kickboxing', 'routines', 'medicine', 'ball', 'intervals', 'following', 'routine.Amy', 'truly', 'shines', 'choreography', 'music', 'choice', 'own', 'Amy', 'DVDs', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'use', 'same', 'move', 'same', 'song', 'Most', 'other', 'instructors', 'Cathe', 'Friedrich', 'Tracey', 'Staehle', 'tend', 'have', 'favorite', 'moves', 'show', 'up', 'lot', 'DVDs.What', 'loved', 'DVD', '**I', 'get', 'great', 'workout', 'low', 'impact', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'moves', 'Amy', 'together', 'always', 'feel', 'worked', 'out', 'doing', '**the', 'music', 'BJ', 'Howe', 'Even', 'songs', 'are', ""n't"", 'top', '40', 'hits', 'are', 'catchy', 'have', 'good', 'driving', 'beat', '**Amy', 'engaging', 'personality', 'genuinely', 'enjoying', 'feel', ""'m"", 'live', 'class', '**the', 'interesting', 'choreography', 'like', 'complex', 'choreography', 'think', 'saves', 'boredom', 'frequently', 'do', 'DVD', '**several', 'premixes', 'when', ""'re"", 'want', 'good', 'workout', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'do', 'full', 'was', 'little', 'confusing', 'DVD', '**the', '4th', 'routine', 'was', 'rather', 'complex', 'long', 'found', 'focusing', 'so', 'much', 'trying', 'get', 'moves', 'down', 'heart', 'rate', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'high', 'think', 'did', 'DVD', 'more', 'often', ""'d"", 'have', 'move', 'down', 'could', 'focus', 'more', 'working', 'hard.Please', 'note', 'DVD', 'advanced', 'exercisers', 'Amy', ""n't"", 'talk', 'too', 'much', 'form', 'show', 'lot', 'modifications', 'really', 'need', 'know', 'body', 'limitations.Amy', ""n't"", 'give', 'lot', 'breakdown', 'moves', 'moves', 'are', 'pretty', 'unique', 'may', 'take', 'while', 'pick', 'up', 'also', 'cue', 'same', 'time', 'move', 'can', 'be', 'confusing', 'some.These', 'characteristics', 'are', 'great', ""'m"", 'advanced', 'exerciser', 'have', 'patience', 'modifications', 'long', 'explanations', 'moves']",Amy Bento: In the Ring Cardio Kickboxing
