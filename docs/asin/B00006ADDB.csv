I bought the DVD because Alida Valli is in it, and I am a fan of hers.

But there are also some that are truly hilarious (and not in a good way), as the special effects employed seem so ridiculous and dated.

Some friends recommended it to me and I attempted to watch it. Attempted is the word that I use to describe this movie because in my opinion it is one of the most unwatchable movies ever. A couple played by William Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg are making love when their baby falls to death from falling out of the window. To repair their marriage and gain solace they go the woods where the husband tries to cure his wife by psychotherapy. What follows is disaster and mayhem which culminates in a bloody climax.I thought the film was strictly for lovers of cinema in which the story unfolds but nothing is obvious, it is up to the viewer to decipher the goings on in the film. Anti Christ is that film. If you like symbolism in films and like to come up with your own version of events then this is the movie to see.

708424,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B00006ADDB,Caleb Williams,"[4, 11]","I have never heard of the work of Lars Von Trier and I have only ever heard mutterings, both positive and negative, of his skills as a director. I am afraid that I am going to lean towards the negatives and agree with the one claim of the director being pretentious. The movie is not a bad effort and actually provided quite a disturbing viewing experience whilst still maintaining my interest throughout. In the UK and, undoubtedly the rest of the world, this film has drawn massive controversy for its graphic sexual depictions and other depictions of self mutilation. There are times when the graphic violence or sexual nature work for the purpose of the plot structure, yet there are other times when the graphic nature appears as a gratuitous insult to my visual senses. The sheer lack of subtlety is what really made me rate this film quite low as in my own perspective; a good director can show as little as possible of the core event of a scene whilst still creating the same desired impact and gaining the same desired reaction from the audience.The plot focuses around He & She, Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg. At the start of the film we see this couple locked in a passionate sexual encounter whilst their young baby boy, Nic falls to his death from a bedroom window. The film is split into four chapters; Grief, Pain (Chaos Reigns), Despair (Gynocide) and The Three Beggars. Chapter 1 shows She wrapped with grief at the death of their child and after collapsing during his funeral she is put in hospital. He, being distrustful of the Psychological care she is receiving, decides to take it upon himself to give her therapy to help her get over the grief of their dead son. During the therapy sessions she keeps visiting an old log cabin located deep in a forest known as Eden. This is her worst fear and it is revealed that this was a cabin where she spent her last summer with Nic whilst she was writing her thesis on Gynocide. He decides that the best way to help her overcome her grief is to visit this cabin and have her confront her fear, little is known at the beginning but the cabin starts to make things a whole lot worse as she falls deeper and deeper into her own insanity.At the initial glance of the trailers of the film and the numerous reports you would read about it, you would be forgiven for thinking this is in any way a horror film. It is not. It is more a psychological thriller as you see both characters destroyed in their own way by the torturous grief resulting from the death of their infant son. Dafoe at the time of making this film is quite a respected actor, but I felt his role in this film was is attempt at something new, sort of a stepping outside the box if you will. His acting was a worthy pleasantry and his placement within the film seemed to work even though I did find that in some of his scenes he seemed particularly awkward. Gainsbourg plays her role spectacularly especially when she delves further and further into the depiction of pure insanity. They had a perfect chemistry with each other and when you consider the types of acts they had to engage into together, it was something that had to exist in order for the film to really work specifically when its entire attention is focused solely around these two characters.Lars Von Trier seems to be a bit of a fan of slow motion as, aside from the initial opening credits, there were a number of moments throughout the film when he would adopt the same slow motion technique and some of them just seemed to be utterly ridiculous. The setting of Eden was a very haunting one and you can sincerely come to terms as to the possible reasons of why this place would become a woman's worst nightmare. The controversial moments are what interested people and had them talking about this film and some of them in particular; I can not help but think they were deliberately graphic for the sake of grabbing some cheap media attention. Not being wholly familiar with other Von Trier works I can not compare this to any of his other work to really define whether this was a deliberate attention grabbing device or something that is used throughout his other films.Overall this is a really good film. It is dark, sick and twisted and if you are of a nervous disposition then I would strongly recommend you give this a miss, or at least have a go at trying to get hold of some form of edited version as the acting alone makes the film worth a watch which is sad in one way as the thing which grabbed it the most attention was the thing, in my eyes, which dragged the quality of the film downwards.",3,"What Gained It The Most Attention, Ultimately Dragged Down The Real Potential.",1251936000,"09 3, 2009",2009,4602,"['have', 'never', 'heard', 'work', 'Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'have', 'only', 'ever', 'heard', 'mutterings', 'positive', 'negative', 'skills', 'director', 'am', 'afraid', 'am', 'going', 'lean', 'negatives', 'agree', 'one', 'claim', 'director', 'being', 'pretentious', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'effort', 'actually', 'provided', 'quite', 'disturbing', 'viewing', 'experience', 'whilst', 'still', 'maintaining', 'interest', 'UK', 'undoubtedly', 'rest', 'world', 'film', 'drawn', 'massive', 'controversy', 'graphic', 'sexual', 'depictions', 'other', 'depictions', 'self', 'mutilation', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sexual', 'nature', 'work', 'purpose', 'plot', 'structure', 'yet', 'are', 'other', 'times', 'when', 'graphic', 'nature', 'gratuitous', 'insult', 'visual', 'senses', 'sheer', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'what', 'really', 'made', 'rate', 'film', 'quite', 'low', 'own', 'perspective', 'good', 'director', 'can', 'show', 'as', 'little', 'possible', 'core', 'event', 'scene', 'whilst', 'still', 'creating', 'same', 'desired', 'impact', 'gaining', 'same', 'desired', 'reaction', 'audience.The', 'plot', 'Willem', 'Dafoe', 'Charlotte', 'Gainsbourg', 'start', 'film', 'see', 'couple', 'locked', 'passionate', 'sexual', 'encounter', 'whilst', 'young', 'baby', 'boy', 'Nic', 'death', 'bedroom', 'window', 'film', 'split', 'four', 'chapters', 'Grief', 'Pain', 'Chaos', 'Reigns', 'Despair', 'Gynocide', 'Three', 'Beggars', 'Chapter', '1', 'wrapped', 'grief', 'death', 'child', 'collapsing', 'funeral', 'put', 'hospital', 'being', 'distrustful', 'Psychological', 'care', 'receiving', 'take', 'give', 'therapy', 'help', 'get', 'grief', 'dead', 'son', 'therapy', 'sessions', 'visiting', 'old', 'log', 'cabin', 'located', 'deep', 'forest', 'known', 'Eden', 'worst', 'fear', 'revealed', 'was', 'cabin', 'where', 'spent', 'last', 'summer', 'Nic', 'whilst', 'was', 'writing', 'thesis', 'Gynocide', 'best', 'way', 'help', 'overcome', 'grief', 'visit', 'cabin', 'have', 'confront', 'fear', 'little', 'known', 'beginning', 'cabin', 'make', 'things', 'whole', 'lot', 'worse', 'deeper', 'deeper', 'own', 'insanity.At', 'initial', 'glance', 'trailers', 'film', 'numerous', 'reports', 'would', 'read', 'would', 'be', 'forgiven', 'thinking', 'way', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'more', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'see', 'characters', 'destroyed', 'own', 'way', 'torturous', 'grief', 'resulting', 'death', 'infant', 'son', 'Dafoe', 'time', 'making', 'film', 'quite', 'respected', 'actor', 'felt', 'role', 'film', 'was', 'attempt', 'something', 'new', 'sort', 'stepping', 'box', 'will', 'acting', 'was', 'worthy', 'pleasantry', 'placement', 'film', 'seemed', 'work', 'even', 'did', 'find', 'scenes', 'seemed', 'particularly', 'awkward', 'Gainsbourg', 'role', 'spectacularly', 'especially', 'when', 'further', 'further', 'depiction', 'pure', 'insanity', 'had', 'perfect', 'chemistry', 'other', 'when', 'consider', 'types', 'acts', 'had', 'engage', 'together', 'was', 'something', 'had', 'exist', 'order', 'film', 'really', 'work', 'specifically', 'when', 'entire', 'attention', 'focused', 'solely', 'two', 'characters.Lars', 'Von', 'Trier', 'be', 'bit', 'fan', 'slow', 'motion', 'aside', 'initial', 'opening', 'credits', 'were', 'number', 'moments', 'film', 'when', 'would', 'adopt', 'same', 'slow', 'motion', 'technique', 'just', 'seemed', 'be', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'setting', 'Eden', 'was', 'very', 'haunting', 'one', 'can', 'sincerely', 'come', 'terms', 'possible', 'reasons', 'why', 'place', 'would', 'become', 'woman', 'worst', 'nightmare', 'controversial', 'moments', 'are', 'what', 'interested', 'people', 'had', 'talking', 'film', 'particular', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'think', 'were', 'deliberately', 'graphic', 'sake', 'grabbing', 'cheap', 'media', 'attention', 'Not', 'being', 'wholly', 'familiar', 'other', 'Von', 'Trier', 'can', 'not', 'compare', 'other', 'work', 'really', 'define', 'was', 'deliberate', 'attention', 'grabbing', 'device', 'something', 'used', 'other', 'films.Overall', 'really', 'good', 'film', 'dark', 'sick', 'twisted', 'are', 'nervous', 'disposition', 'then', 'would', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'give', 'miss', 'least', 'have', 'go', 'trying', 'get', 'hold', 'form', 'edited', 'version', 'acting', 'alone', 'film', 'watch', 'sad', 'one', 'way', 'thing', 'grabbed', 'most', 'attention', 'was', 'thing', 'eyes', 'dragged', 'quality', 'film', 'downwards']",N/A

708426,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00006ADDB,C. Sawin,"[15, 19]","This is quite possibly the most disturbing film I've ever sat through. While Antichrist doesn't show absolutely everything and it's usually rather brief when it comes to showing disturbing material, it shows enough to make your stomach drop.Everything leading to the last half of the film is done incredibly well. The cinematography is rather incredible, especially while they're in Eden. Everything is so lush and green while certain shots alone say more than the characters in the film ever could. The score is haunting and successfully establishes putting its viewers on edge. The entire film is spent with this married couple and their performances are top notch. It's just those last thirty to forty five minutes take such an abrupt turn. Nothing can really prepare you for how unrelenting and horrifying the finale is. The events that unfold in this film will haunt you and stick with you for an incredibly long time.The less you know about Antichrist, the more surprising that first viewing will be. That's the main reason this review is so vague. Don't read up on it and don't watch anything other than the trailer before seeing the film. Just be warned, the film shows enough for a gutwrenching reaction. Antichrist's strongest asset is the atmosphere it builds throughout the film. The air just seems to be constantly thick with the fact that something terrible is going to happen at any moment.

Not surprising really) However this film ignoring the ""Warning contains scenes of a sexual and disturbing nature"" Is just quite frankly dull.Yes, there are moments of cinematic brilliance and the director seems to have spent far too much time capturing visual image than he has in actually putting together a half decent film.  The visual of the opening scene is brilliant as are a number of other scenes in the camping lodge however as I say, it just doesnt deflect from the utterly tedious nature of this film.Defoe and his misses are buisy making love when their son climbs out of cot, opens the child safety doors to the bedroom and proceeds to fall out of the window, his wife has a nervous breakdown and Defoe being a psychiatrist decides that after seeing his better half spend over a month in an institution pumped full of drugs to take her back to the holiday lodge in the middle of nowhere to cure her of her melancholy state.  Unfortunately for Defoe he gets more than he bargained for as he soon finds out that his better half is in fact as mad as a box of frogs.The problems with this film are numerous.  Not least that Dafoe has one of the most monotone voices on earth and has a personality that you simply cant relate to but also the fact that for the most part of the film its just him making boring notes about his wifes condition while he tries out various ""games"" To cure her (Such as curing her of her phobia of walking on the grass by putting two rocks on either side of the lawn and having her walk across)  Occasionally they have sex (Presumably this is the ""Sexually graphic bit"" But if Defoe wriggling around on top of some woman is your thing well, each to their own I suppose) and more and more Dafoe finds out about his better halfs dark side.  Things here go from bad to worse and the film spirals out of any coherent sense.  He finds pictures of his son with his shoes on the wrong way and confronts her that she has been doing this for quite some time causing him to have a deformity of the feet (Some may as why the hell didnt Defoe notice this, had he never put the kids shoes on or something? Had he never bothered to look at the kids feet or notice he was crying in pain?) It just smacks of middle class pretentious parents who quite frankly have never bothered to notice their own kids until they are gone.  He then finds various pieces of writing (And here comes the accusations of the film being misogynist) By her claiming women are somehow evil (Well this one is shall we say a little crazy) Defoe confronts her with this but within about 5 minutes probably wishes he hadn't and just jumped in the car and got himself home.Then we have the gratuitous and utterly unnecessary violence.  Its probably on par with Audition in its graphic nature.  Loving wife proceeds to hobble Dafoe by drilling a hole in his leg and attaching a lump of concrete to it (As she doesnt want him to leave her.  Could she have not just paid for a nice night out at a restaurant instead?) It then just goes on and out as wife goes from slightly disturbed woman recovering from the loss of child to out and out loon bag.  The change is just too great to make any sense and you get the impression this is thrown in by a desperate director hoping for something to draw in the cinema going crowd.  The violence continues with the wife then cutting a piece of her own genitalia off with rusty scissors (Again why?) And Dafoe conveniently finding a wrench below the floorboards to get the concrete off his leg (Must remember to put one there myself, you never know) again this makes no sense.I would imagine people who found films like 9 songs cinema at its best will love this dross but to be honest if I filmed paint drying in the back yard and told some people it was directed by someone with an East European name they would love it.  I read that this had a fair few positive reviews which to be honest just goes to show how far from reality and the cinema going world some of these people are.

A doctor brought in to help cure her apparently psychological affliction begins to experiment with hypnosis, opening a door to a past life that would be better left closed. All Hell breaks loose, quite literally, when Ippolita decides to let Satan into her life again and soon finds herself the devil's tool for bringing about his victory on Earth.""The Antichrist"", also known as ""The Tempter"", is a flawed but surprisingly good little Italian horror film. No doubt, a fair portion of the film (the latter part) is an ""Exorcist"" wannabe, but everything that leads up to the big exorcism is really quite different and interesting. And, yes, there's a big orgy scene during a Satanic ceremony at one point, and yes, it does involve Ippolita tasting the business end of a goat, but that part is more implied than anything. Now, as for the ""rip-off"" exorcism aspect (though I don't see why we should only have one film involving an exorcism and call all others ""rip-offs""), yeah, some of the effects are laughable and it doesn't have the scares of the classic Linda Blair film (and Carla Gravina is no hottie-hot-hottie Linda Blair), but it still works for the story being presented and has its own, lighter brand of creepiness. I did find it rather amusing how the characters of the film constantly sent mixed messages about what they believed in, in regards to supernatural vs. science, as well as claiming things like psychic phenomenon to be established scientific facts, but on the whole this movie is successful as what it should be, a piece of entertainment. It is entertaining throughout, and the story is engaging.""The Antichrist"", which also stars Mel Ferrer and Arthur Kennedy, is available here from Anchor Bay in a nice enhanced widescreen. Bonus features include a TV spot, a poster and still gallery, and ""Raising Hell"", which is an interview with the film's director, Alberto De Martino. Composer Ennio Morricone also takes part.

708441,A2EDZH51XHFA9B,B00006ADDB,"Robert Beveridge ""xterminal""","[0, 0]","L'Antichristo (Alberto de Martino, 1974)Mediocre Italian Exorcist ripoff with principal cinematography by Joe D'Amato, which should tell you just about all you need to know about the lack of quality to be found in this flick. Still, given that it's got some pretty big names in it, it's got some cache among completists of various seventies B-movie actors.Plot: pretty much the same as The Exorcist, save that the possessed girl is a good deal older and in a wheelchair (though there is some speculation right from the get-go that her lameness is psychosomatic). Said possessed girl, Hippolita, is played by Big Deal on Madonna Street's Carla Gravina; her father Massimo is played by B stalwart Mel Ferrer. The two have had something of a tense relationship since the death of Hippolita's mother, especially now that Dad's got himself a sweet young thing not that much older than Hippolita (Anita Strindberg, in actuality three years younger than Gravina). This is not helped much when the devil, through various machinations, possesses Hippolita.De Martino, who co-wrote the script with Gianfranco Clerici (responsible for output of exceptionally variable quality, from the classic Cannibal Holocaust to the awful giallo Murderock), desperately wanted to come up with a script as well-paced as that of The Exorcist, but where the first hour and a half of that movie is full of tension, the first half of The Antichrist drags along doing next to nothing. Once Hippolita finds herself with an unwelcome visitor, things get a little more interesting, but not much. As is usual with Italian films from the seventies, dubbing was done in multiple languages, so the movie is dubbed instead of subbed; oddly, however, there are long stretches where this wasn't done (e.g., the first eight minutes), despite this not being labelled as a director's cut of any sort or the like. Ironically, they actually add to the mystique, and those are some of the movie's more interesting stretches. (No, I don't speak a word of Italian.) Basically, if you're a fan of Mel Ferrer, Arthur Kennedy, Carla Graviano, or Alida Valli, this is worth your time. Otherwise, you can safely skip it. * ",2,"Amusing, stupid, and shot by Joe D'Amato.

I'm somewhere in the middle. ""Antichrist"" is a about a couple that are suffering from the tragic loss of their toddler son. The child's death is especially hard on the wife(Charlottle Gainsbourg) who falls into a deep anxious depression. The husband(willem Dafoe), who happens to be a psychotherapist, decides to treat her. After a few sessions, he discovers that her anxiety is heightened when she thinks about their cabin in the woods(I'm thinking that von Trier is an Evil Dead fan)called ""Eden"". So what's better than a little confrontational therapy? The couple set out for a little camping trip and things get progressively bizarre. As the plot thickens, we discover that ""She""(Dafoe and Gainsbourg have no names in the film) spent time in Eden writing her dissertation on the morbid subject of ""Gynocide""(I.e the murder of women) During her studies in isolation, she becomes obsessed and warped by the subject material, believing that woman aren't only the victims of evil but also a powerful source of it. She also becomes fixated on a fictional constellation called ""The three beggars"" which is comprised of a dear(grief),fox(pain) and crow(despair).The animals make their appearances in the films more disturbing scenes and come off as forest spirits demanding human sacrifice. ""Antichrist's magic is in its ability to build tension and its cinematography. von Trier uses a lot of extreme camera zooms into dirt and tree branches that are hauntingly unsettling. Many of the films more intense moments are shot like the characters are running through a hall of mirrors, which helps add to the feeling of disorientation and paranoia. Beyond that I felt that ""Antichrist"" didn't have much to offer. The plot was thin and there were times where a otherwise scary moment was ruined by something silly. During the film I knew there was a line that von Trier was dieing to cross(If you've seen ""Dancer in the Dark"" you know he likes to cross some lines). When that line came, and he danced over it, I felt that he built the whole movie around it and the rest of the movie was cheapened because of it. ""Antichrist"" is going to be remembered for those parts and that's a shame because I think that they where the weaker points of the film. Not for the squeamish, ""Antichrist"" is definitely a acquired taste.

708446,AHHJ57HFFZ0BF,B00006ADDB,"Spiraling Blue Fire ""Curiouser and curiouser...""","[5, 9]","I just watched this film for the second time and am convinced that this film is destined to be hailed, cursed and studied for years to come ~ Lars von Trier is so brillant. (DEFINITELY RECOMMEND.)I believe this is a metaphorical movie about misogyny (the hatred of women). For example, the character played by Charlotte Gainbourg, her thesis was on ""Gynocide"" and the torturing of women ~ there were photos of the witch hunts in the attic, the husband discovers. The child's shoes, twisting the bones in his feet to grow perversely, were symbolic to Chinese foot binding of little girls. Her orgasm and watching the child fall from the window is tricky. But I think it was to show the possiblility of calousness/""evil"" in females. It possibly even has to do with how women are shamed when it comes to their sexuality. She even goes so far as to mutilate her own genitals ~ as was, and is still, forced on little girls and teenagers.Eden is significant in that Eve, in the creation myth in the Bible, is blamed for letting loose ""evil"" and ""sin"" into the world. She is the vessel thru which life springs and thusly death follows, as ancient misogynists use to preach... that may be the child falling metaphor there. Historians consider the Bible a misogynistic text, so the anti-christ title may mean something along the lines of that feminism is anti-christ.I mean, go back and listen to the dialogue! This movie is an incredible conversational piece about misogyny and the silence of our history as women, and the emotional chaos that stems from the violence of which we've sprung. It's also poetic, horrifying, enchanting, and authentic. (I hope those animals weren't actually harmed but I don't know.) The acting is phenomenal. The storytelling ~ dreamlike and nightmarish.Be brave.
