I'd heard of the show but did not watch in its original run or in reruns. But I happened upon this DVD dirt cheap and decided it was time to see what all the excitement was about.And I enjoyed it. I'd read about the controversial aspect of the ending and, before watching, thought it was a gutsy move by the film makers. Having the heroine of the show get butchered and stay dead at the end is not your typical happy ending to a series.The final episodes were great! Campy, goofy, dramatic, kind of dumb, yet, thoroughly entertaining. Lucy Lawless is an irresistible screen presence and deserves most of the credit for the entertainment quality of what I've seen so far.I've since picked up Season Two and am looking forward to watching it. It may be a strange way to get into a series, starting at the end, but it worked for me. I don't recommend it. But I do recommend the show.

This once great series which gave us four wonderful seasons should have ended with the brilliant ""Fallen Angel"" at the beginning of Season Five and would be remembered as the groundbreaking classic is was meant to be. Killing your shero is bad enough, but decapitating her and hanging her out to dry is simply unforgivably disgusting. Watch ""A Day in the Life"" or ""The Debt"" if you want to see near-perfect episodes.  Additional comments (added Aug. 2004): If they ever do resurrect the WP as rumor now has the producer attempting to buy back the rights (and why can't Sam Raimi, Mr. Spiderman, just snap his fingers and have that happen?) for a film version it would be most welcome but, it still will never change the ugly way in which they chose to end the series.

You either loved it or loathed it, unless your me who liked it but didn't think it was in top &quot;Xena&quot; form.  The most fun on this DVD, in my opinion, is the running commentary by producer and director Rob Tapert, the flawless Ms. Lucy Lawless, and new mama Renee O'Connor.  The fun never stops listening to these three discuss their insights, short-comings, goals, and wicked senses of humor.While the plot may be out of left field (and a pop fly for many), I feel the cinematography is beautiful.

And it will go down as one of my favorite shows of all time.  It had action, comedy, camp, drama - EVERYTHING!  That said this series finale does a great disservice to this show.  Now I would have preferred that Xena and Gabrielle rode off into the sunset with each other but I'm not totally disappointed that she was killed.  What I am disappointed at is this episode that had more Xena backstory and going to Japan and ghost killers, evil demons, and just plain junk.  If you want to experience what this show was and have never seen it before, don't buy this DVD.  Watch Xena from episode one and experience what we all did so long ago (or so it seems).  Watch the amazing fighting scenes, Xena's catchy one-liners, Gabrielle's annoying cuteness, and ultimately the love that developed between Xena and Gabrielle - a love beyond sexuality! It's truly amazing.  We all had our ideas about how this show would end, and certainly few can be happy with the mess that came to be A Friend in Need.  Xena backstory should have been done with the far superior ring, rheinegold, and return of the valkyrie trilogy.  My hope would be for the end to be Xena and Gabrielle simply reminiscing about their past adventures and then to ride off into the sunset for new adventures.  Too bad that didn't happen.

It seems to me that are three types of Xena fans out there- those who absolutely HATE the ending, those who LOVE it and those who continually vacillate between loving it and hating it the more times they see it. I'm the latter one.When it first aired, I was infuriated how Xena ended with her trying to atone for her battered past, the seemingly thoughtless introduction of new characters, the artsy Japanese setting, the repeated use of the word &quot;friend&quot;, the nagging feeling that everything was SO NOT Xena! Most of us fanatics wanted the lushness of ancient Greece in the backdrop, the traditional Xena &amp; Gab costumes and demeanor, the sweltering emotional turmoil, the soul pinching dialogue, heartening bonds of love and loss, the complex struggles, the undaunting action sequences and every other great tool which helped define the INCREDIBLE 6th and final season. All of this was included in the finale but presented in such a way that was unfamiliar and unexpected...not very characteristic of the roughness and nobleness we've come to expect from the show and the show's writers. Sometimes I feel it was just downright bizarre- like it came from out of left field'; Other times, I respect Tapert's vision even though I don't necessarily agree with his tastesThe whole idea of Xena scampering off to an exotic place with hopes of fulfilling the wishes of a foreign female companion from her dark past (this was news to Gab!) had already been done in season 3! I just try to view this episode all on its own (if you don't, you'll probably be disappointed) The acting was remarkable, the scenery was fitting and warm to the story, the chemistry between X &amp; G acceptable, the heroics were up to standard, the dialogue (except for the use of the word &quot;friend&quot; a few too many times) was enjoyable and very much characteristic of Robert Tapert's strangeness and obsession with foreign cultures and ideas.I just finished viewing it with the audio commentary turned on (something I had put off doing on account that I felt it would take away from how I like to percieve Xena and Gabrielle on my own terms and how I simply value their characters so deeply.) Much to my disbelief, I was amazed! Lucy Lawless and Renee O'Connor are simply adorable- ragging on themselves, laughing, casually recollecting treasured moments and ideas, providing personal insight and glow, their takes on subtext (Lucy rocks when it comes to this! I have a totally new respect for her), reflecting on how they tried to view and portray their characters and why...they all really surprised me. Rob Tapert is more serious about it- explaining technical tidbits, overall regrets, the sources of his inspirations (mostly Chinese horror movies), how they pulled certain things off, his expectations, and voicing personal memories; It all seemed so rare; Most of my questions about the episode's intentions were eloquently answered. I know the point of commentaries are suppose to make you feel as if you're actually having a viewing with the director and actors...so often that's not the case yet this time, IT TRULY FELT THAT WAY! A very unique experience...For a summary of what actually transpires, the editor's review is pretty accurate.",5,To be Xena is to battle on....,1023840000,"06 12, 2002",2002,3516,"['ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'less', '5', 'stars', 'Xena', 'so', 'eloquently', 'put', 'one', 'quot', 'not', 'exactly', 'how', 'would', ""'ve"", 'done', 'quot', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'here', ""'ve"", 'been', 'devoted', 'Xena', 'fan', 'day', 'one-', 'thick', 'thin', 'tumult', 'amp', 'triumpths', 'are', 'three', 'types', 'Xena', 'fans', 'out', 'there-', 'who', 'absolutely', 'HATE', 'ending', 'who', 'LOVE', 'who', 'continually', 'vacillate', 'loving', 'hating', 'more', 'times', 'see', ""'m"", 'latter', 'first', 'aired', 'was', 'infuriated', 'how', 'Xena', 'ended', 'trying', 'atone', 'battered', 'past', 'seemingly', 'thoughtless', 'introduction', 'new', 'characters', 'artsy', 'Japanese', 'setting', 'repeated', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'friend', 'quot', 'nagging', 'feeling', 'everything', 'was', 'SO', 'NOT', 'Xena', 'Most', 'fanatics', 'wanted', 'lushness', 'ancient', 'Greece', 'backdrop', 'traditional', 'Xena', 'amp', 'Gab', 'costumes', 'demeanor', 'sweltering', 'emotional', 'turmoil', 'soul', 'pinching', 'dialogue', 'heartening', 'bonds', 'love', 'loss', 'complex', 'struggles', 'undaunting', 'action', 'sequences', 'other', 'great', 'tool', 'helped', 'define', 'INCREDIBLE', '6th', 'final', 'season', 'was', 'included', 'finale', 'presented', 'such', 'way', 'was', 'unfamiliar', 'unexpected', 'not', 'very', 'characteristic', 'roughness', 'nobleness', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'show', 'show', 'writers', 'Sometimes', 'feel', 'was', 'just', 'downright', 'bizarre-', 'came', 'left', 'field', 'Other', 'times', 'respect', 'Tapert', 'vision', 'even', 'do', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'agree', 'tastesThe', 'whole', 'idea', 'Xena', 'scampering', 'off', 'exotic', 'place', 'hopes', 'fulfilling', 'wishes', 'foreign', 'female', 'companion', 'dark', 'past', 'was', 'news', 'Gab', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'season', '3', 'just', 'try', 'view', 'episode', 'own', 'do', ""n't"", ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'was', 'remarkable', 'scenery', 'was', 'fitting', 'warm', 'story', 'chemistry', 'X', 'amp', 'G', 'acceptable', 'heroics', 'were', 'up', 'standard', 'dialogue', 'use', 'word', 'quot', 'friend', 'quot', 'few', 'too', 'many', 'times', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'very', 'much', 'characteristic', 'Robert', 'Tapert', 'strangeness', 'obsession', 'foreign', 'cultures', 'ideas.I', 'just', 'finished', 'viewing', 'audio', 'commentary', 'turned', 'something', 'had', 'put', 'off', 'doing', 'account', 'felt', 'would', 'take', 'away', 'how', 'like', 'percieve', 'Xena', 'Gabrielle', 'own', 'terms', 'how', 'simply', 'value', 'characters', 'so', 'deeply', 'Much', 'disbelief', 'was', 'amazed', 'Lucy', 'Lawless', 'Renee', ""O'Connor"", 'are', 'simply', 'adorable-', 'ragging', 'laughing', 'casually', 'recollecting', 'treasured', 'moments', 'ideas', 'providing', 'personal', 'insight', 'glow', 'subtext', 'Lucy', 'when', 'have', 'totally', 'new', 'respect', 'reflecting', 'how', 'tried', 'view', 'portray', 'characters', 'why', 'really', 'surprised', 'Rob', 'Tapert', 'more', 'serious', 'it-', 'explaining', 'technical', 'tidbits', 'overall', 'regrets', 'sources', 'inspirations', 'mostly', 'Chinese', 'horror', 'movies', 'how', 'pulled', 'certain', 'things', 'off', 'expectations', 'voicing', 'personal', 'memories', 'seemed', 'so', 'rare', 'Most', 'questions', 'episode', 'intentions', 'were', 'eloquently', 'answered', 'know', 'point', 'commentaries', 'are', 'suppose', 'make', 'feel', ""'re"", 'actually', 'having', 'viewing', 'director', 'actors', 'so', 'often', 'not', 'case', 'yet', 'time', 'IT', 'TRULY', 'FELT', 'THAT', 'WAY', 'very', 'unique', 'experience', 'summary', 'what', 'actually', 'editor', 'review', 'pretty', 'accurate']",N/A
688118,A16Z7G9BBYH9EN,B00005V9I4,"Lauren H. Lavine ""Highlandlasse""","[258, 290]","XENA THESIS OF SHOW AND THE SERIES FINALEThe Director's cut of ""A Friend In Need"" Series Finale. At the very least the aired versions ""A Friend In Need"" parts one and two.I know a lot of people didn't like it. I thought Rob Tapert did an EXCELLENT job. After all Xena (Lucy Lawless) said (in I believe it was the first season) in response to Gabrielle's (Renee O'Connor) comment about being old and gray together that people like us don't get old and gray. Meaning that when one lives that kind of life style it tends to be short.It was very realistic when Xena died. Let's face it given the life she led. It was Karma really. She took so many lives in her evil years. Sometimes the show didn't give enough weight to the fact that had someone really done the things she did, they would have been sentenced to capital punishment. I don't believe in the death sentence, but I would have committed her to life without the possibility of parole.She was truly EVIL. She killed for sport for god sakes. Her motto was basically death to them all kind of deal. She had no regard for the miracle or sanctity of life She had a passion and lust for power and didn't care who she had to destroy to get it. She murdered all the Amazon leaders because Alti promised that she would become The Destroyer Of Nations. The fact that she wanted to wear that as a mantle says it all. She wanted to wipe the Centaurs off the map and would have had it not been for Borias stopping her. She liked that people feared her. Sounds very much like a female version of Hitler.It's also why she was so very good at fighting evil, because she was it, she understood it. She knew how evil people thought and therefore was really almost better equipped to fight it than most. She knew just how far some people were willing to go to get what they wanted and understood the mind set that takes and how to get in it's way.It is also what made her character so very interesting. She was not a female version of Hercules. He was goody, goody all the time and let's face it that gets boring entertainment wise, not in reality. Her character had many layers and probably made it more fun for the actors to play. That is why the character of Gabrielle wasn't as good at fighting evil as Xena, because she didn't have it in her to be evil and at times didn't believe what lengths a person would go to get what they wanted. It's not because she wasn't as good a fighter or could be, it was because she just did not have that much of a dark side to her.I thought Renee played Gabrielle extremely well. As Lucy did Xena.Do I believe she could redeem herself? In reality no. Nevertheless, this is TV and there were times even in her evil years that she did show some compassion. So given that it's TV, yes I believe she could, but not without paying the ultimate price and she did. Her life. It pretty much had to end that way to give any substance to the series. Especially the way she died. The violent nature of it. It was the ultimate self sacrifice and to redeem herself she had to die, and die violently so that others (souls) will be freed. Others that she herself had condemned to eternal suffering.Honestly, I believe I could write a thesis on the finale and how it gave the entire show meaning. It enriched every episode. After seeing it and then watching the show again from the trilogy on Hercules to the very first and through to the last episode of Xena knowing how it would all end, well it just made everything that much better.I know the show is all fantasy and entertainment and I myself enjoyed it very much when it aired and still on occasion watch the DVD's, but realistically it pretty much had to end that way.I consider myself a person that likes good story telling, acting, directing, just art in general. I don't however label myself a fan. I don't go to conventions or any of it. However, I liked the way that it ended so well that I wanted to put my two cents in.Some fans did not like Gabrielle going off alone in life without her.Well people wake up and smell the coffins. People we love die all the time. It's a part of life. Why is it that we all know intellectually that we will die and some how are shocked when it happens. Do you ever notice how people say IF I should die. There is no IF people, just WHEN. Yet that's all we ever hear.I guess having cheated death myself several times, I have a better grasp than most on my own mortality.The real point being that ""A Friend In Need"" was Epic in it's own right. One need never see any episodes and still enjoy it as a movie by itself. She was directly responsible for the death of 40,000 innocent people. Given the artistic license of the soul theory, (I personally believe we have a soul but, not everyone does) it only made sense that if all she had been working to do was to help others and eventually redeem herself. This was the perfect opportunity for her to let's say put up or shut up.It gave more meaning to her life with Gabrielle and everything that she had learned from her through out their time together. She knew that if she was ever going to save her own soul that she had to be willing to put it on the line in the end. It gave her years of searching for the greater good meaning. I really believe the character learned more from Gabrielle than the other way around.Gabrielle learned that in the end one must fight for what they believe in for she already understood Love and self sacrifice. Xena on the other hand learned that if she was ever going to find the peace and redemption that craved so much that she had to learn that Love and self sacrifice was the only way to achieve that goal.Xena is one of the main reasons that ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" was filmed in New Zealand. Quite a few actors as well as crew and the clothing designer that worked on Xena worked on ""LORD OF THE RINGS"", and were nominated for Oscars. That in and of itself says a lot. In closing I must say that this is most definitely watching a movie of EPIC proportions. There is nothing just television about it.The Director's cut is a MUST BUY!!!",5,XENA  -  THESIS OF SHOW AND THE SERIES FINALE,1117065600,"05 26, 2005",2005,6074,"['XENA', 'THESIS', 'OF', 'SHOW',

I only watched the Director's Cut on the last and final episode because I read in reviews that the first version was no good.  Well, I didn't like the way they told the story on this episode.  Rob Tapert and the other producers involved should have thought out really hard on how they should have made the final episode.  This is a t.v. show and they can do whatever story they want to make.  They should have considered first of all the fans feelings because the fans are the ones to watch and buy the show.  Why the heck could they not present a final story where Xena and Gabrielle do their last final good deed battle and maybe Xena or Gabrielle get hurt real bad but not die.  A final episode should be a happy one for both Xena and Gabrielle and that will make a lot of fans happy and content.  just that simple.  Why they made it so complicated and so gory, depressing, frustrating, disgusting finale beats me.  I'm not watching that Director's cut anymore because it's not worth it.

The acting is superb, the level of the special effects is huge, and all the elements that made Xena one of the best action series of all time are there.

From other reviews I thought the director's cut- which I definitely got was supposed to end with Gaberielle alone, not with Xena's ghost on the boat with her.  Either reviews are wrong and the director's cut does end this way or somehow the dvds labeled director's cut really aren't the director's cut- atleast not the original.  COULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHICH OF THESE IS RIGHT??I never saw the finale on television, so I don't have anything to compare my to.  If there are two versions of the finale, a dvd with both versions should really be released.This episode was pretty good.  I was expecting somewhat more from a finale, but it was no where near as bad as some say.  Alot of this series was about redemption and forgiveness.  The episode going back and forth from the present to flashbacks of something that happpened when Xena was evil was very interesting and a great idea for the finale- goes to show how far Xena has come.Given the circumstances, Xena did the right thing in the end- for others AND for herself- she already had to live with doing so much evil in the past, then finding out that what she did resulted in so many deaths and that the she had to stay dead in order to save their souls, what choice did she really have?  And Xena had to die way before Gaberielle considering that previous episode where they have to travel forward to another of their incarnations- the person Xena was was very old, and the person Gaberielle was was really young.  So, obviously Xena had to die first in order to be reborn first.I don't think that it was really necessary for Xena to be beheaded though, seeing her the way Gaberielle saw her after she was killed (those of you who have seen this will know what I am talking about) was really awful.",3,"pretty good, not great",1071014400,"12 10, 2003",2003,1792,"['got', 'version', 'think', 'other', 'reviews', 'thought', 'director', 'cut-', 'definitely', 'got', 'was', 'supposed', 'end', 'Gaberielle', 'alone', 'not', 'Xena', 'ghost', 'boat', 'reviews', 'are', 'wrong', 'director', 'cut', 'end', 'way', 'somehow', 'dvds', 'labeled', 'director', 'cut', 'really', 'are', ""n't"", 'director', 'cut-', 'atleast', 'not', 'original', 'COULD', 'SOMEBODY', 'PLEASE', 'TELL', 'ME', 'WHICH', 'OF', 'THESE', 'IS', 'RIGHT', 'never', 'saw', 'finale', 'television', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'compare', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'finale', 'dvd', 'versions', 'should', 'really', 'be', 'released.This', 'episode', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'was', 'expecting', 'somewhat', 'more', 'finale', 'was', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'bad', 'say', 'Alot', 'series', 'was', 'redemption', 'forgiveness', 'episode', 'going', 'back', 'forth', 'present', 'flashbacks', 'something', 'happpened', 'when', 'Xena', 'was', 'evil', 'was', 'very', 'interesting', 'great', 'idea', 'finale-', 'show', 'how', 'far', 'Xena', 'come.Given', 'circumstances', 'Xena', 'did', 'right', 'thing', 'end-', 'others', 'AND', 'herself-', 'already', 'had', 'live', 'doing', 'so', 'much', 'evil', 'past', 'then', 'finding', 'out', 'what', 'did', 'resulted', 'so', 'many', 'deaths', 'had', 'stay', 'dead', 'order', 'save', 'souls', 'what', 'choice', 'did', 'really', 'have', 'Xena', 'had', 'die', 'way', 'Gaberielle', 'considering', 'previous', 'episode', 'where', 'have', 'travel', 'forward', 'incarnations-', 'person', 'Xena', 'was', 'was', 'very', 'old', 'person', 'Gaberielle', 'was', 'was', 'really', 'young', 'So', 'obviously', 'Xena', 'had', 'die', 'first', 'order', 'be', 'reborn', 'first.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'really', 'necessary', 'Xena', 'be', 'beheaded', 'seeing', 'way', 'Gaberielle', 'saw', 'was', 'killed', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'will', 'know', 'what', 'am', 'talking', 'was', 'really', 'awful']",N/A

Real Life is full of saddness, misery, loss and tragedy.  We watch TV and movies to escape reality.  Xena was a tragic figure in the beginning of her life.  She killed for little or no reason. But she saw that she was wrong.  She changed her ways and fought for justice. There is no way to bring those killed back to life. But Xena repented and devoted her life to fight for good. She risked her life many times in order to save the lives of countless others. (Let those without sin throw the first stone) We need a heroine like Xena.  We want to see that those in the ""white hats"" win and the bad guys in the ""black hats"" lose.  I know that reality does not work out that way many times.  But Xena was different.  She is special. I think it is most digusting, very tragic and pathetic that Xena had to die.  And if dying wasn't enough, beheading her made my stomach turn.  I own the entire series.

688128,AGRR05FH945HR,B00005V9I4,Steven Cain,"[9, 14]","I'll give this four stars out of respect to LL and ROC, who turned in stellar performances. However, like most Xena fans, I was very disappointed with the ending.Not only did Xena cash in her chips in a less than spectacular fashion, the Kiss Of Life sequence was somewhat safely ambiguous. For a series that contained more Sapphic Subtext than you could shake a stick at, the ""Gabby's just kissing her to transfer the waters of life"" excuse was something of an anti-climax, especially after six seasons. I don't think anybody expected the thespian crush to be fully consummated, but a clearer expression of their obvious mutual attraction would have been more appropriate.This was a powerful double episode and had it not been for Xena's demise, it would have been better received. Certainly one of the finest examples of Lawless and O'Connor's acting prowess. So much so, that it would be criminal not to re-pair the two in a well-written Return episode or movie. Lawless has indicated that she would be open to this very project, so we can but hope.Worth having, even for the sake of completeness, and if there is a Return episiode, series or movie, the traumatic effects of Friend In Need will be greatly lessened. For now, it is the end, and an unsatisfying ending at that. Xena was the greatest female Warrior figure since Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, and with the massive cult following that the series has generated, you would think that there simply must be more.

This series finale doesn't work for me.  All the special effects were fantastic.  Both Lucy and Renee gave 110% to this 2 part episode.  But the plot falls short of our expectations of how the series should have ended.  Xena and Gabrielle should have walked off together like Hercules and Ioalus.  The blame falls square on the shoulders of the Executive Producer and Lucy's husband, Rob Tapert.  He made the decison to have Xena die.  To die is one thing, but the way she dies is just sick. Seeing Xena beheaded is over the top.  Seeing Gabrielle all alone was more than I could bear.  It hurts to watch this episode.  If you love Xena and Gabrielle like I do....watch ""When Fates Collide"" as your series finale.  It's much easier on the heart.
