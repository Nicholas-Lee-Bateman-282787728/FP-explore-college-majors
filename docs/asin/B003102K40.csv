1316625,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B003102K40,Ben Wasden,"[8, 8]","House Of Fears is a very tame and cookie-cutter horror movie. It's like a feature-length episode of Goosebumps. It's about a haunted house attraction called House of Fears that can bring your worst fears to life. Only it's not supposed to be real. Unfortunately, for a group of good-looking teenagers it's more real than they anticipated.'Fears' is the perfect movie for teenage girls to watch while having a sleepover. It's not gory or violent, and there isn't any sex and nudity. It's all very generic, bump in the night kind of stuff. I'm giving it 3 stars because any movie that has both an evil clown and an evil scarecrow can't be all bad. I just wish there was something in House Of Fears that could scare adults, and not just their nieces and nephews.",3,'Fears' Is Pretty Tame Stuff,1279411200,"07 18, 2010",2010,759,"['House', 'Fears', 'very', 'tame', 'cookie-cutter', 'horror', 'movie', 'feature-length', 'episode', 'Goosebumps', 'haunted', 'house', 'attraction', 'called', 'House', 'Fears', 'can', 'bring', 'worst', 'fears', 'life', 'Only', 'not', 'supposed', 'be', 'real', 'Unfortunately', 'group', 'good-looking', 'teenagers', 'more', 'real', 'anticipated', ""'Fears"", 'perfect', 'movie', 'teenage', 'girls', 'watch', 'having', 'sleepover', 'not', 'gory', 'violent', ""n't"", 'sex', 'nudity', 'very', 'generic', 'bump', 'night', 'kind', 'stuff', ""'m"", 'giving', '3', 'stars', 'movie', 'evil', 'clown', 'evil', 'scarecrow', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'bad', 'just', 'wish', 'was', 'something', 'House', 'Fears', 'could', 'scare', 'adults', 'not', 'just', 'nieces', 'nephews']",N/A

Each new room brings to life one of the teens' greatest fears as they struggle to escape alive! HOUSE OF FEARS may not live up to its premise, but does put together a few decent frights and some moody atmospherics. Ryan Little makes full use of the shooting location, which outperforms his actors in every way. The cast members are unenthusiastic as they sleepwalk through the spooky maze, rarely screaming or laughing as the various gags spring out at them from all sides. Things quickly change when they start being chased down by a gnarled scarecrow, a terrifying clown, and a pale faced killer. Clumsy writing makes it difficult to tell who is afraid of what or why the monsters attack the entire group and not just the individual, but it's best not to overthink the picture. Although HOUSE OF FEARS would make a better attraction than a film, it adds a few fun shocks to the average teen Slasher.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",3,House of Fears,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",2011,1153,"['Things', 'are', ""n't"", 'fun', 'games', 'group', 'friends', 'decide', 'sneak', 'local', 'haunted', 'attraction', 'when', 'unwittingly', 'unleash', 'number', 'vile', 'demons', 'ancient', 'relic', 'mistaken', 'stage', 'prop', 'new', 'room', 'life', 'one', 'teens', 'greatest', 'fears', 'struggle', 'escape', 'alive', 'HOUSE', 'FEARS', 'may', 'not', 'live', 'up', 'premise', 'put', 'together', 'few', 'decent', 'frights', 'moody', 'atmospherics', 'Ryan', 'Little', 'full', 'use', 'shooting', 'location', 'actors', 'way', 'cast', 'members', 'are', 'unenthusiastic', 'sleepwalk', 'spooky', 'maze', 'rarely', 'screaming', 'laughing', 'various', 'gags', 'spring', 'out', 'sides', 'Things', 'quickly', 'change', 'when', 'start', 'being', 'chased', 'down', 'gnarled', 'scarecrow', 'terrifying', 'clown', 'pale', 'faced', 'killer', 'Clumsy', 'writing', 'difficult', 'tell', 'who', 'afraid', 'what', 'why', 'monsters', 'attack', 'entire', 'group', 'not', 'just', 'individual', 'best', 'not', 'overthink', 'picture', 'HOUSE', 'FEARS', 'would', 'make', 'better', 'attraction', 'film', 'few', 'fun', 'shocks', 'average', 'teen', 'Slasher.-Carl', 'ManesI', 'Horror', 'Movies']",N/A

It already had the ""atmosphere"" in place--a local ""haunted house"" that six teens decide to visit before it opens.  You were advised the house was designed around ""what things people are usually scared the most of,"" such as spiders, mummies, the fear of going insane, and clowns (to name a few).  And I also knew going in this was an independent movie, so there wouldn't be much budget to work with.  But somewhere along the way, I think the script disappeared--ENTIRELY.As pointed out to me by other not-so-kind reviewers, in horror movies one has to ""just go with it"", and I REALLY tried, but when you've got a script that has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, it's just really hard not to find yourself saying, ""huh?"".  The acting in here was not that bad.  In fact, I found it to be better than much of the recently-released big budget remakes (Nightmare on Elm Street and My Soul to Take come to mind).  Unfortunately, it was the script (or lack thereof) that failed the actors.The movie is unrated.  I'm still trying to figure out that one.  There is no nudity, very little blood; just some language.  Kills either happen off screen or are done without all the ""goo.""  So, I will give props to the filmmakers for that.  Usually, independent horror films go way overboard with the ick factor.  Had the screenwriter had some more time to really think out his ideas and if the director could actually have seen them through, this might have been a decent film.  Instead, you're just left scratching your head wondering what could have been.",2,Nice Try...But NO!,1307664000,"06 10, 2011",2011,1618,"['shocking', 'how', 'House', 'Fears', 'could', 'have', 'failed', 'so', 'miserably', 'already', 'had', 'atmosphere', 'place', 'local', 'haunted', 'house', 'six', 'teens', 'decide', 'visit', 'were', 'advised', 'house', 'was', 'designed', 'what', 'things', 'people', 'are', 'usually', 'scared', 'most', 'such', 'spiders', 'mummies', 'fear', 'going', 'insane', 'clowns', 'name', 'few', 'also', 'knew', 'going', 'was', 'independent', 'movie', 'there', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'much', 'budget', 'work', 'somewhere', 'way', 'think', 'script', 'disappeared', 'ENTIRELY.As', 'pointed', 'out', 'other', 'not-so-kind', 'reviewers', 'horror', 'movies', 'one', 'just', 'go', 'REALLY', 'tried', 'when', ""'ve"", 'got', 'script', 'more', 'holes', 'Swiss', 'cheese', 'just', 'really', 'hard', 'not', 'find', 'saying', 'huh', 'acting', 'here', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'fact', 'found', 'be', 'better', 'much', 'recently-released', 'big', 'budget', 'remakes', 'Nightmare', 'Elm', 'Street', 'My', 'Soul', 'Take', 'come', 'mind', 'Unfortunately', 'was', 'script', 'lack', 'thereof', 'failed', 'actors.The', 'movie', 'unrated', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'one', 'nudity', 'very', 'little', 'blood', 'just', 'language', 'Kills', 'happen', 'off', 'screen', 'are', 'done', 'goo', 'will', 'give', 'props', 'filmmakers', 'Usually', 'independent', 'horror', 'films', 'go', 'way', 'overboard', 'ick', 'factor', 'Had', 'screenwriter', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'really', 'think', 'out', 'ideas', 'director', 'could', 'actually', 'have', 'seen', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'decent', 'film', 'Instead', ""'re"", 'just', 'left', 'scratching', 'head', 'wondering', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been']",N/A

Nope.The movie gave it's own best comment: ""This is a house of lame"".You can use this.. um... ""film""? as a horror movie clich&eacute; check list.This thing was like a made for TV movie commissioned and then rejected by the CW network.It seems to me they over spent on this thing. I've seen films with a lower budget that where ten times better because of the story and plot.The general idea (freaky statue that actually makes your fears come to life and kill you) was good but could have been done way better. The film sets itself up for potential awesome (band name) but falls short on delivering.The only good I can see come from this film is if someone from Thatguywiththeglasses covers it.If Riftrax does this I would definitely be willing to sit through it again. Honestly I hope the makers of House of Fears either learn from the mistakes made here and go on to make much better films, or find a new line of work.I will give the film one good point: Towards the beginning one of the guys dresses up as a killer and jumps out at the others. One of the other guys punches him. That has to be in more horror films.In the end it's NOT a horror film and not even a suspense film.It should have been titled ""Wasted Potential"" that would have been more accurate.This is probably the only ""horror"" film more boring thanThe Blair Witch Project",1,House of Lame,1322438400,"11 28, 2011",2011,1394,"['thought', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'spooky', 'clown', 'film', 'Nope.The', 'movie', 'gave', 'own', 'best', 'comment', 'house', 'lame', '.You', 'can', 'use', 'this..', 'um', 'film', 'horror', 'movie', 'clich', 'eacute', 'check', 'list.This', 'thing', 'was', 'made', 'TV', 'movie', 'commissioned', 'then', 'rejected', 'CW', 'network.It', 'over', 'spent', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'films', 'lower', 'budget', 'where', 'times', 'better', 'story', 'plot.The', 'general', 'idea', 'freaky', 'statue', 'actually', 'fears', 'come', 'life', 'kill', 'was', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'way', 'better', 'film', 'sets', 'up', 'potential', 'awesome', 'band', 'name', 'short', 'delivering.The', 'only', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'come', 'film', 'someone', 'Thatguywiththeglasses', 'covers', 'it.If', 'Riftrax', 'would', 'definitely', 'be', 'willing', 'sit', 'again', 'Honestly', 'hope', 'makers', 'House', 'Fears', 'learn', 'mistakes', 'made', 'here', 'go', 'make', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'find', 'new', 'line', 'work.I', 'will', 'give', 'film', 'one', 'good', 'point', 'beginning', 'one', 'guys', 'up', 'killer', 'out', 'others', 'One', 'other', 'guys', 'be', 'more', 'horror', 'films.In', 'end', 'NOT', 'horror', 'film', 'not', 'even', 'suspense', 'film.It', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'titled', 'Wasted', 'Potential', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'accurate.This', 'probably', 'only', 'horror', 'film', 'more', 'boring', 'thanThe', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'Project']",N/A
1316629,A3UA046AA3DXFD,B003102K40,Sid the Elf,"[2, 5]","When the brothers Sid were back in the golden years of childhood B horror remained the king out there. What inspired us to this love of b is still uncertain but a few key factors laid the groundwork; 1) The first viewing of Death Ring at 1:00 am in 1994, years of Saturday night Monstervision entries with Joe Bob, and movie channels the cable company forgot to shut off at Santa's workshop. For some reason it all took off and led us on a lifetime journey to quench our B thirsts that never seems to end. Despite a distance between the Super Sid Brothers the goal remains the same...to ram the world with B reviews in ways most are confused by. With all that said we're brought to our feature of the evening called House of Fears flashing an insane looking clown on the cover. And if I was there I'd be like...ahhh sweet.House of Fears is a very typical story that involves some high school kids (that all look like they're in their upper 20's) as they get themselves in some shenanigans in a local haunted house type attraction. Among the forgettable cast is the main stud, his goofy buddy, the token black guy, the easy chick, and the shy girl. Before you know it there's change missing from your dresser and your daughter's knocked up..I've seen it a hundred times. This attraction they're in winds up being overcome by an evil spirit that brings your worst fears to come and kill you. Come to think of it, this one actually ripped off the premiseThe Fear! That's something non of us would have ever thought possible.Overall it's your typical run of the mill horror flick of today but was pretty entertaining. Anytime we get the chance to see some straight to video goodness we just have to jump on the opportunity. Kind of like the way you can't resist folding up an Andy's candy wrapper and flicking it to hit the old boy Santa directly in between his specs. And then getting to see him wake up briefly to call you ""as***les"" while falling right back to sleep to only get pelted again moments later. So yeah it's like that in a way. You take your chances with these movies, sometimes they fall short and sometimes you hit paydirt in between the giant coke bottle specs. This one kind of hit somewhere in the middle realm that would be the equivalent of semi decent Simmons soundboard prank lasting a couple minutes.",3,"I'm one of the best looking, best singing mutha....you ever seen if your life",1282608000,"08 24, 2010",2010,2321,"['When', 'brothers', 'Sid', 'were', 'back', 'golden', 'years', 'childhood', 'B', 'horror', 'remained', 'king', 'out', 'there', 'What', 'inspired', 'love', 'b', 'still', 'uncertain', 'few', 'key', 'factors', 'laid', 'groundwork', '1', 'first', 'viewing', 'Death', 'Ring', '1:00', 'am', '1994', 'years', 'Saturday', 'night', 'Monstervision', 'Joe', 'Bob', 'movie', 'channels', 'cable', 'company', 'forgot', 'shut', 'off', 'Santa', 'workshop', 'reason', 'took', 'off', 'led', 'lifetime', 'journey', 'quench', 'B', 'never', 'end', 'distance', 'Super', 'Sid', 'Brothers', 'goal', 'same', 'ram', 'world', 'B', 'reviews', 'ways', 'most', 'are', 'confused', 'said', ""'re"", 'brought', 'feature', 'evening', 'called', 'House', 'Fears', 'flashing', 'insane', 'looking', 'clown', 'cover', 'was', ""'d"", 'be', 'ahhh', 'sweet.House', 'Fears', 'very', 'typical', 'story', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'look', ""'re"", 'upper', '20', 'get', 'shenanigans', 'local', 'haunted', 'house', 'type', 'attraction', 'forgettable', 'cast', 'main', 'stud', 'goofy', 'buddy', 'token', 'black', 'guy', 'easy', 'chick', 'shy', 'girl', 'know', 'change', 'missing', 'dresser', 'daughter', 'knocked', 'up..I', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'hundred', 'times', 'attraction', ""'re"", 'winds', 'up', 'being', 'overcome', 'evil', 'spirit', 'worst', 'fears', 'come', 'kill', 'Come', 'think', 'one', 'actually', 'ripped', 'premiseThe', 'Fear', 'something', 'non', 'would', 'have', 'ever', 'thought', 'possible.Overall', 'typical', 'run', 'mill', 'horror', 'flick', 'today', 'was', 'pretty', 'entertaining', 'Anytime', 'get', 'chance', 'see', 'straight', 'video', 'goodness', 'just', 'have', 'jump', 'opportunity', 'Kind', 'way', 'ca', ""n't"", 'resist', 'folding', 'up', 'Andy', 'candy', 'wrapper', 'flicking', 'hit', 'old', 'boy', 'Santa', 'directly', 'specs', 'then', 'getting', 'see', 'wake', 'up', 'briefly', 'call', 'as***les', 'falling', 'right', 'back', 'sleep', 'only', 'get', 'pelted', 'again', 'moments', 'later', 'So', 'way', 'take', 'chances', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'fall', 'short', 'sometimes', 'hit', 'paydirt', 'giant', 'coke', 'bottle', 'specs', 'one', 'kind', 'hit', 'somewhere', 'middle', 'realm', 'would', 'be', 'equivalent', 'semi', 'decent', 'Simmons', 'soundboard', 'prank', 'lasting', 'couple', 'minutes']",N/A
