565065,A2MF0N72JVXDAP,B000053V5B,The Phantom,"[47, 49]","This movie is pretty much wall-to-wall sex, surrounding a massage therapist who gets more nookie than really should be allowed by law or convention. He's banging four different chicks and beds all of them at different times before the movie hits the 20-minute mark.Sounds great, doesn't it? Only in this version (Rated R, based on seller description), you won't see as much as you probably will want to see. Several of the sex scenes are edited strangely--they go into a weird slow motion--which makes me believe that there is indeed an unrated cut out there somewhere, if only it can be found. That version might well earn five stars.Mia Zottoli-Ava Lake (among other stage names) makes an early, pre-op appearance here, where she is playing--will wonders never cease?--a fairly chaste young woman of 19. I didn't say that this movie was very believable.One thing that bugs me about this film is an obvious attempt to try to hijack the popularity of the movie ""Animal Instinct,"" even down to the cover art.
