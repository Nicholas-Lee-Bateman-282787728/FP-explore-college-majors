1412485,A24IJY3V0804WJ,B004KPPQFK,Amit Talpade,"[3, 4]","Dhobi Ghat marks the debut of Kiran Rao and is a a video diary of Mumbai, shot mostly on location in Mumbai. There are four characters in the film, Aamir Khan is Jai, the reclusive painter, Shai ( Monica Dogra ) who is an investment banker on sabbatical from the U.S. Munna ( Prateik Babbar) the washer-man, the young bride Yasmin ( Kirti Malhotra)whose video diaries chronicle her elation at arriving in Mumbai as a young bride to her fateful decision. Finally there is the background, which I would call the fifth character which is city of Mumbai. Ms. Rao the director carefully weaves all these stories together in an uneven mosaic which stays with you after the film.Aamir as Aarun excels and that is expected but I give him more credit for staying in the background in his own production and letting the other actors and story do the bidding. Monica Dogra, is an investment banker who in in a platonic friendship with a laundry man, etches a balanced role and adds an important dimension to the film,watching her in the final scene in the car is a treat. However I feel that the accolades should go to Prateik Babbar as Munna who essays this role with such a conviction that makes you think if acting is in the genes ( he is the son of Smita Patil and Raj Babbar). Then there is Kirti Malhotra as Yasmin who records her mumbai experience for her brother who cannot visit. Her characters conclusion will shock you. Then there is Mumbai, it has been shot so beautifully and never looked so full of life. I loved the film and I think you will too.

Teslovich,"[0, 2]","Not the usual musical rom-com from India but a triangle love drama that seems to borrow more from Argentinian and European film in showing the love, tragedy and suspense as the wealthy and the poor interact in Mumbai. Naturalistic cinematography showing how Mumbai breathes life; comfortably well acted by both novice and experienced actors; an acoustic stringed musical score by Santaolalla that gently guides the viewer through the life of the city along with our three protagonists. This is one of the few westernized Bollywood movies that I've seen that integrated both worlds without seeming commercial, shallow, misleading or culturally compromising.",4,Westernized Bollywood,1326931200,"01 19, 2012",2012,656,"['Not', 'usual', 'musical', 'rom-com', 'India', 'triangle', 'love', 'drama', 'borrow', 'more', 'Argentinian', 'European', 'film', 'showing', 'love', 'tragedy', 'suspense', 'wealthy', 'poor', 'interact', 'Mumbai', 'Naturalistic', 'cinematography', 'showing', 'how', 'Mumbai', 'life', 'comfortably', 'well', 'acted', 'novice', 'experienced', 'actors', 'acoustic', 'stringed', 'musical', 'score', 'Santaolalla', 'gently', 'viewer', 'life', 'city', 'three', 'protagonists', 'one', 'few', 'westernized', 'Bollywood', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'integrated', 'worlds', 'seeming', 'commercial', 'shallow', 'misleading', 'culturally', 'compromising']",Dhobi Ghat

1412489,A14H191AH66PPK,B004KPPQFK,Traddles,"[12, 12]","""Dhobi Ghat"" is a film that revolves around five characters: firstly, the city of Mumbai itself, followed by four individuals, some of whom have been drawn to Mumbai from other parts of India.  Arun (Aamir Khan) is an angsty, moody artist whose inner life we never fully penetrate; Shai (Monica Dogra) is an Americanized Indian who is on sabbatical from her finance job in the US; Munna (Prateik) is a washerman (in the Dhobi Ghat area of the city) and aspiring movie star, who came to Mumbai at a young age to escape poverty; and Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) is a young woman who migrated to Mumbai from Uttar Pradesh after getting married.  The film is a window into their four lives, as individuals and also in the ways their lives intersect.  Mumbai stands as the connecting element - the city that, for very different reasons, drew them to itself.  Although the city's landscape and movement is filmed beautifully by writer/director Kiran Rao, we also get the sense that Mumbai can be an imposing, and perhaps coldly indifferent, presence.  Not all of the characters' lives are affected positively by their time in the city.The performances are top-caliber from all involved.  Aamir Khan has the least lines of anyone, but he conveys everything necessary (and more) through his face alone. He is utterly convincing as a sullen but gifted painter.  The character of Shai is immediately grating, which is probably a testament to the performance of Monica Dogra, as it seems her character was meant to be jarringly at odds with the landscape around her; she is seemingly unaware of the easy affluence of her life.  While Arun lives in a decaying (but bright and airy) apartment in a crowded neighborhood of the city, Shai lives in a hermetically sealed highrise apartment, cloistered from the city's sounds and smells.  She belongs to a circle of wealthy, educated urbanites who are skeptical of her plan to photograph the inner workings of the city.  Whether you see Shai's interests as grounded in a genuine desire to understand Mumbai, or simply a desire to photograph ""the natives"", as it were, probably depends on your reaction to her character as a whole.  She breezily initiates a friendship with the young man who washes her clothes, without fully understanding the consequences of that friendship.The young man is Munna, the aspiring actor.  I had only seen Prateik in a small role in one other film, and I was very impressed with his performance here.  He is perfect as a reticent and still-naive laborer with other goals for his life.  Some of his scenes can be heartbreaking, but his narrative arc will leave you feeling that he'll make it in the world, somehow.The character of Yasmin was the standout for me. She is the most enigmatic figure in the film, yet somehow also the most revealed and certainly the most touching. The pace of this film is slow, but there is a moment toward the end involving Yasmin's character in which Arun and the audience make a simultaneous, sudden realization that will have your heart skipping a beat.Overall, the film is a thoughtful meditation on Mumbai and its inhabitants, punctuated with beautiful photographs (ostensibly taken by Shai, though they feel like they could be Kiran Rao's own photographs). The minimalist musical score combined with the city is slightly reminiscent of scenes from ""Lost in Translation"", though I don't want to imply that this film needs an American comparison or equivalent - it certainly doesn't.  The stories end ambiguously, as stories tend to do in real life as well.",5,Delicate Ode to a City,1302134400,"04 7, 2011",2011,3549,"['Dhobi', 'Ghat', 'film', 'around', 'five', 'characters', 'firstly', 'city', 'Mumbai', 'followed', 'four', 'individuals', 'whom', 'have', 'been', 'drawn', 'Mumbai', 'other', 'parts', 'India', 'Arun', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'angsty', 'moody', 'artist', 'inner', 'life', 'never', 'fully', 'penetrate', 'Shai', 'Monica', 'Dogra', 'Americanized', 'Indian', 'who', 'sabbatical', 'finance', 'job', 'US', 'Munna', 'Prateik', 'washerman', 'Dhobi', 'Ghat', 'area', 'city', 'aspiring', 'movie', 'star', 'who', 'came', 'Mumbai', 'young', 'age', 'escape', 'poverty', 'Yasmin', 'Kriti', 'Malhotra', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'migrated', 'Mumbai', 'Uttar', 'Pradesh', 'getting', 'married', 'film', 'window', 'four', 'lives', 'individuals', 'also', 'ways', 'lives', 'intersect', 'Mumbai', 'connecting', 'element', 'city', 'very', 'different', 'reasons', 'drew', 'city', 'landscape', 'movement', 'filmed', 'beautifully', 'writer/director', 'Kiran', 'Rao', 'also', 'get', 'sense', 'Mumbai', 'can', 'be', 'imposing', 'perhaps', 'coldly', 'indifferent', 'presence', 'Not', 'characters', 'lives', 'are', 'affected', 'positively', 'time', 'city.The', 'performances', 'are', 'top-caliber', 'involved', 'Aamir', 'Khan', 'least', 'lines', 'anyone', 'conveys', 'everything', 'necessary', 'more', 'face', 'alone', 'utterly', 'convincing', 'sullen', 'gifted', 'painter', 'character', 'Shai', 'immediately', 'grating', 'probably', 'testament', 'performance', 'Monica', 'Dogra', 'character', 'was', 'meant', 'be', 'jarringly', 'odds', 'landscape', 'seemingly', 'unaware', 'easy', 'affluence', 'life', 'Arun', 'decaying', 'bright', 'airy', 'apartment', 'crowded', 'neighborhood', 'city', 'Shai', 'hermetically', 'sealed', 'highrise', 'apartment', 'cloistered', 'city', 'sounds', 'smells', 'circle', 'wealthy', 'educated', 'urbanites', 'who', 'are', 'skeptical', 'plan', 'photograph', 'inner', 'workings', 'city', 'see', 'Shai', 'interests', 'grounded', 'genuine', 'desire', 'understand', 'Mumbai', 'simply', 'desire', 'photograph', 'natives', 'were', 'probably', 'reaction', 'character', 'whole', 'breezily', 'friendship', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'clothes', 'fully', 'understanding', 'consequences', 'friendship.The', 'young', 'man', 'Munna', 'aspiring', 'actor', 'had', 'only', 'seen', 'Prateik', 'small', 'role', 'one', 'other', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'performance', 'here', 'perfect', 'reticent', 'still-naive', 'laborer', 'other', 'goals', 'life', 'scenes', 'can', 'be', 'heartbreaking', 'narrative', 'arc', 'will', 'leave', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'make', 'world', 'somehow.The', 'character', 'Yasmin', 'was', 'standout', 'most', 'enigmatic', 'figure', 'film', 'somehow', 'also', 'most', 'revealed', 'certainly', 'most', 'touching', 'pace', 'film', 'slow', 'moment', 'end', 'involving', 'Yasmin', 'character', 'Arun', 'audience', 'make', 'simultaneous', 'sudden', 'realization', 'will', 'have', 'heart', 'skipping', 'beat.Overall', 'film', 'thoughtful', 'meditation', 'Mumbai', 'inhabitants', 'punctuated', 'beautiful', 'photographs', 'ostensibly', 'taken', 'Shai', 'feel', 'could', 'be', 'Kiran', 'Rao', 'own', 'photographs', 'minimalist', 'musical', 'score', 'combined', 'city', 'slightly', 'reminiscent', 'scenes', 'Lost', 'Translation', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'imply', 'film', 'American', 'comparison', 'equivalent', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'stories', 'end', 'ambiguously', 'stories', 'tend', 'do', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well']",Dhobi Ghat
