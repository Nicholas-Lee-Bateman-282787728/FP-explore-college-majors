But these are the elements that make the movie funny! While disjointed at times, the story is entertaining and 100% original!The cast (which includes several &quot;latino&quot; actors), is amazing and Woody Allen is, as always, hilariously neurotic!. For those who understand how powerful and self-effacing comedy works, &quot;Picking Up The Pieces&quot; is a masterpiece...There is absolutely no mean-spirited humor here.Underneath all the unordothox humor &amp; &quot;stereotype&quot;lies a study in human faith, dignity, &amp; morality...Oh yes, Cheech Marin has made his share of &quot;stereotype&quot; movies...Remember Cheech &amp; Chong?Come on people lighten up!For those who  question how this cast was assmembled...the DVD has short interviews where the actors (Latinos AND non-Latinos),say they made this film for two main reasons...First, because of the uniqueness of the script, and second, the chance to work with the great Woody Allen....I gave this film only four stars because the sound quality was not very good. The dialogue often sounded like it was recorded at low levels,making it quite difficult to understand...I'm grateful that the DVD had English subtitles, as I used them so I wouldn't miss a thing...No one can enjoy a film if they're straining to understand what the actors are saying.This film deserves a wider audience...for those who don't &quot;get&quot; this film, please watch the last ten seconds where Woody Allen's character sums it all up by saying &quot;If you can't take a joke.....$#@@....  yourself!.........This is a totally original, funny, dark, twisted, comedy..a must see !

It was shown on Cinemax for a few months, but it was  originally intended for the big screen.  Therefore, this DVD version is  actually the closest chance for the public to enjoy it as it was  conceived.This independent film was produced by the Kushner-Locke  Company, and it's about a kosher butcher (Woody Allen playing as Woody  Allen) sick and tired of his  unfaithful wife (Stone), up to the point  where he kills her and cuts her into pieces.  On his way to bury her  remains he loses a hand, that is found by a blind woman that recovers  sight.

555334,A1MWAQCQ1G3CL3,B00004WI55,Dorion Sagan,"[5, 10]","Although this often execrable, cheaply punning (e.g., ""see"" ""si""), monolingual (the devil's!) monstrosity is easily among Woody Allen's worst (if not his worst) it is still, not so surprisingly, better than most films. That is because despite its socially unredeeming ploys (e.g., sex in church, a slattern-wife's severed bird-flipping hand that grants miracles such as big breasts and a dirt-scraping penis to a midget of a darker hue; and a poor Jimi Hendrix copy who sings obnoxious songs) it is kind of fun to look at the cast tramp through the mock New Mexico town El Nino. The end of the film, from which Allen with seeming genuine hostility draws the sermonizing moral that God seems to be saying ""if you can't take a joke go .... yourself,"" is symptomatic of the film's comic misfiring and lack of subtlety. Some T, but little A although I confess I fell asleep in the middle. My favorite part was the recycled Lenny Bruce joke that the Jews didn't really kill Jesus, it was a party that got out of hand. Some of the bits with Kiefer Sutherland as a state trooper were also good. Allen, who plays a magician-butcher who cuts his pretty wife (Sharon Stone, good job) in half with a buzz saw to begin the show, near the end comes to confess his crime prefacing his remarks with the confession that he has never confessed before because he is Jewish. But what are the many scenes of psychoanalysis depicted in his films if not confessions by another name? I think this movie actually has a serious intent that was compromised by commercial expectations and Allen's aesthetic choice to make it a complete farce; it is clever, and better than watching Jim Carey pull faces, but lacks heart-as if Allen were seething with anger but had only the light, feathery pillows of commercially successful comedy available with which to vent his intense frustration (at Catholicism and religious hypocrisy in general, unfaithful women, cute guys, himself, death, unappreciative audiences, etc. etc.)",3,Your Typical Weak Buzz Saw Milagro Farce,1054425600,"06 1, 2003",2003,1991,"['often', 'execrable', 'cheaply', 'punning', 'e.g.', 'see', 'si', 'monolingual', 'devil', 'monstrosity', 'easily', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'worst', 'not', 'worst', 'still', 'not', 'so', 'surprisingly', 'better', 'most', 'films', 'socially', 'unredeeming', 'ploys', 'e.g.', 'sex', 'church', 'slattern-wife', 'severed', 'bird-flipping', 'hand', 'grants', 'miracles', 'such', 'big', 'breasts', 'dirt-scraping', 'penis', 'midget', 'darker', 'hue', 'poor', 'Jimi', 'Hendrix', 'copy', 'who', 'obnoxious', 'songs', 'kind', 'fun', 'look', 'cast', 'tramp', 'mock', 'New', 'Mexico', 'town', 'El', 'Nino', 'end', 'film', 'Allen', 'seeming', 'genuine', 'hostility', 'sermonizing', 'moral', 'God', 'be', 'saying', 'ca', ""n't"", 'take', 'joke', 'go', 'symptomatic', 'film', 'comic', 'misfiring', 'lack', 'subtlety', 'T', 'little', 'A', 'confess', 'fell', 'asleep', 'middle', 'favorite', 'part', 'was', 'recycled', 'Lenny', 'Bruce', 'joke', 'Jews', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'kill', 'Jesus', 'was', 'party', 'got', 'hand', 'bits', 'Kiefer', 'Sutherland', 'state', 'trooper', 'were', 'also', 'good', 'Allen', 'who', 'magician-butcher', 'who', 'pretty', 'wife', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'good', 'job', 'half', 'buzz', 'saw', 'begin', 'show', 'end', 'confess', 'crime', 'prefacing', 'remarks', 'confession', 'never', 'confessed', 'before', 'Jewish', 'are', 'many', 'scenes', 'psychoanalysis', 'depicted', 'films', 'not', 'confessions', 'name', 'think', 'movie', 'actually', 'serious', 'intent', 'was', 'compromised', 'commercial', 'expectations', 'Allen', 'aesthetic', 'choice', 'make', 'complete', 'farce', 'clever', 'better', 'watching', 'Jim', 'Carey', 'pull', 'heart-as', 'Allen', 'were', 'seething', 'anger', 'had', 'only', 'light', 'feathery', 'pillows', 'commercially', 'successful', 'comedy', 'available', 'vent', 'intense', 'frustration', 'Catholicism', 'religious', 'hypocrisy', 'general', 'unfaithful', 'women', 'cute', 'guys', 'death', 'unappreciative', 'audiences', 'etc', 'etc']",Picking Up the Pieces
555335,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B00004WI55,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[1, 2]","In ""Picking Up the Pieces"" Woody Allen plays a kosher butcher named Tex Cowley, complete with the cowboy boots and Stetson, who chops up his philandering wife Candy (Sharon Stone) into seven pieces.  He buries the pieces across the border from Texas in New Mexico, but loses Candy's hand.  A blind woman stumbles across the hand, which is still giving the finger (apparently a last act of defiance as Candy was butchered), and is cured.  The next thing we know the hand is being venerated in the church of a small town for its ability to work miracles, much to the dismay of the local priest, Father Leo (David Schwimmer), and the delight of Mayor Machado (Cheech Marin) and the locals.  After all, not only are their prayers answered but the town ends up being overrun by tourists willing to pay for anything having to do with the hand.Now, you look at that plot summary and the stellar cast that shows up for this one and you would think ""Picking Up the Pieces"" is a Woody Allen movie, but it is actually written by Bill Wilson and directed by Alfonso Arau.  It is the first screenplay for the writer but the director did ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and ""A Walk in the Clouds,"" which would certainly explain why the cast showed up for this one.  That is because the script does not know what to do with this rather interesting premise.  There are some funny moments, but ultimately ""Picking Up the Pieces"" makes you appreciate the coherence and passion of Kevin Smith's ""Dogma.""I want to think that this film is a satire, but I am not sure exactly what the target is supposed to be here.  I do not think it is the Catholic Church, even though the Vatican dispatches Elliott Gould, Fran Drescher and Andy Dick to authenticate ""the hand of the Virgin.""  I thought maybe it was a scathing look the notion of faith, but that seemed off point since the hand is indeed miraculous even though if from the nature of the miracles it seems clear the hand belongs to an American.  Then I mulled over notions of justice given that counterbalancing the miracles of the hand is the quest of Bobo (Keiffer Sutherland), a Texas lawman and one of Candy's many lovers who wants to bring her husband to justice.  But that did not work out to a tenable position either.Then at the end in Woody Allen's final voice over, the morale (or punch line) to the film is revealed.  That was almost enough for me to drop this 2000 comedy's rating one more star and you understand why this film went direct to video in the United States (but was actually released in Spain, presumably because of Arau, and in France, obviously because of Allen's name in the cast).  But the premise is too good even if the execution is that bad.  Still, even though there was a commentary track in which the director probably explains what he was thinking, I decided to skip it because once Arau explained in the featurette on the DVD that being the key to being politically incorrect was to be subversive, it became clear there really was no real point to what was going on, just the aforementioned punch line.Allen's nebbish actually gets to be less of a nebbish than we are accustomed to and there are some nice moments when he is up against Sutherland's hardnosed cop.  However the focal character in the film is Schwimmer's priest, who is, ironically enough, the one character who is outside of what is going on with the hand and its miracles.  I thought that the fact he was more interested in Desi (Maria Grazia Cucinotta), a local prostitute, than he was in his church was a key to understanding the film, but that turned out not to be the case either in this farcical fantasy.  Eddie Griffin as Sediento (""Always thirsty"" apparently), the town drunk, is the biggest scene stealer as the miracles and tourists get his character to speak up as the conscience for the town, but he turns out to be a dead end.  Arau tells us this is a black romantic comedy with a touch of farce done in a magical realistic manner as an example of political incorrectness.  I am not prepared to argue against that interpretation fo the text, but knowing that is what is going on does not really help you get any more out of watching the film.In terms of DVD extras are a series of interview clips with individual cast members, but not including Allen and Stone, which would probably have been the most interesting ones of all, in keeping with our overall disappointment with the film.  But there is a trivia game, which will punish you for having paid so much attention to the film and sometimes confuse you as to whether the clips they show are telling you if you got it right or wrong.",3,Great hook and then Arau's farce just ends up disappointing,1106870400,"01 28, 2005",2005,4628,"['Picking', 'Up', 'Pieces', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'kosher', 'butcher', 'named', 'Tex', 'Cowley', 'complete', 'cowboy', 'boots', 'Stetson', 'who', 'up', 'philandering', 'wife', 'Candy', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'seven', 'pieces', 'pieces', 'border', 'Texas', 'New', 'Mexico', 'Candy', 'hand', 'blind', 'woman', 'hand', 'still', 'giving', 'finger', 'apparently', 'last', 'act', 'defiance', 'Candy', 'was', 'butchered', 'cured', 'next', 'thing', 'know', 'hand', 'being', 'venerated', 'church', 'small', 'town', 'ability', 'work', 'miracles', 'much', 'dismay', 'local', 'priest', 'Father', 'Leo', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'delight', 'Mayor', 'Machado', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'locals', 'not', 'only', 'are', 'prayers', 'answered', 'town', 'up', 'being', 'overrun', 'tourists', 'willing', 'pay', 'anything', 'having', 'do', 'hand.Now', 'look', 'plot', 'summary', 'stellar', 'cast', 'up', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'Picking', 'Up', 'Pieces', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'movie', 'actually', 'written', 'Bill', 'Wilson', 'directed', 'Alfonso', 'Arau', 'first', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'director', 'did', 'Water', 'Chocolate', 'Walk', 'Clouds', 'would', 'certainly', 'explain', 'why', 'cast', 'showed', 'up', 'one', 'script', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'rather', 'interesting', 'premise', 'are', 'funny', 'moments', 'ultimately', 'Picking', 'Up', 'Pieces', 'appreciate', 'coherence', 'passion', 'Kevin', 'Smith', 'Dogma', 'want', 'think', 'film', 'satire', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'exactly', 'what', 'target', 'supposed', 'be', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'Catholic', 'Church', 'even', 'Vatican', 'dispatches', 'Elliott', 'Gould', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'authenticate', 'hand', 'Virgin', 'thought', 'maybe', 'was', 'scathing', 'look', 'notion', 'faith', 'seemed', 'off', 'point', 'hand', 'indeed', 'miraculous', 'even', 'nature', 'miracles', 'clear', 'hand', 'American', 'Then', 'mulled', 'over', 'notions', 'justice', 'given', 'counterbalancing', 'miracles', 'hand', 'quest', 'Bobo', 'Keiffer', 'Sutherland', 'Texas', 'lawman', 'one', 'Candy', 'many', 'lovers', 'who', 'bring', 'husband', 'justice', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'tenable', 'position', 'either.Then', 'end', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'final', 'voice', 'morale', 'punch', 'line', 'film', 'revealed', 'was', 'almost', 'enough', 'drop', '2000', 'comedy', 'rating', 'one', 'more', 'star', 'understand', 'why', 'film', 'went', 'direct', 'video', 'United', 'States', 'was', 'actually', 'released', 'Spain', 'presumably', 'Arau', 'France', 'obviously', 'Allen', 'name', 'cast', 'premise', 'too', 'good', 'even', 'execution', 'bad', 'Still', 'even', 'was', 'commentary', 'track', 'director', 'probably', 'what', 'was', 'thinking', 'decided', 'skip', 'once', 'Arau', 'explained', 'featurette', 'DVD', 'being', 'key', 'being', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'was', 'be', 'subversive', 'became', 'clear', 'really', 'was', 'real', 'point', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'just', 'aforementioned', 'punch', 'line.Allen', 'nebbish', 'actually', 'be', 'less', 'nebbish', 'are', 'accustomed', 'are', 'nice', 'moments', 'when', 'up', 'Sutherland', 'hardnosed', 'cop', 'However', 'focal', 'character', 'film', 'Schwimmer', 'priest', 'who', 'ironically', 'enough', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'what', 'going', 'hand', 'miracles', 'thought', 'fact', 'was', 'more', 'interested', 'Desi', 'Maria', 'Grazia', 'Cucinotta', 'local', 'prostitute', 'was', 'church', 'was', 'key', 'understanding', 'film', 'turned', 'out', 'not', 'be', 'case', 'either', 'farcical', 'fantasy', 'Eddie', 'Griffin', 'Sediento', 'Always', 'thirsty', 'apparently', 'town', 'drunk', 'biggest', 'scene', 'stealer', 'miracles', 'tourists', 'get', 'character', 'speak', 'up', 'conscience', 'town', 'out', 'be', 'dead', 'end', 'Arau', 'black', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'touch', 'farce', 'done', 'magical', 'realistic', 'manner', 'example', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'am', 'not', 'prepared', 'argue', 'interpretation', 'fo', 'text', 'knowing', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'really', 'help', 'get', 'more', 'watching', 'film.In', 'terms', 'DVD', 'extras', 'are', 'series', 'interview', 'clips', 'individual', 'cast', 'members', 'not', 'including', 'Allen', 'Stone', 'would', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'most', 'interesting', 'ones', 'keeping', 'overall', 'disappointment', 'film', 'trivia', 'game', 'will', 'punish', 'having', 'paid', 'so', 'much', 'attention', 'film', 'sometimes', 'confuse', 'clips', 'show', 'are', 'telling', 'got', 'right', 'wrong']",Picking Up the Pieces

But the cast (as well as the plot) has as much variety as a typical Allen flik-- David Schwimmer, Sharon Stone, Kiefer Southerland, Cheech Marin, Andy Dick, Fran Drescher, and the gorgeous Maria Grazia Cucinotta, to name a few.In reading the negative reviews for this flik, it would seem that thinly-disguised (or even overt) ""moral indignation"" over the subject matter is the main reason for their discontent.  Hmm.  Methinks they doth protest a bit too much?  Can't help but wonder how many of these folks would have the same viewpoint about ""The Trouble with Harry"", ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", ""Eating Raoul"", ""Manhattan Murder Mystery"", or any of the myriad of other dark comedies about murder and its aftermath.Oh, but right-- THOSE flix don't make fun of religion... and its mindless, mercenary followers.  Hits a few sore spots, does it?Of course, one would have to excuse anyone who's had a family member or friend that was killed, for finding the movie distasteful... but then, ANY flick about murder would be out of bounds for them, light comedy or otherwise.  Everyone else needs to revisit the definition of ""dark comedy"", before bitching and whining so much.  This film is really, really funny!Oh, and for the guy who said ""stupidity is not funny"". . . Gee, I wonder what Laurel & Hardy, the Stooges, or the Marx Brothers would say about that, considering they made an entire career out of lampooning the basic stupidity of all people?  In fact, I'd say that a good 75% of humor involves laughing at the stupidity and misfortune of ""others"" (and therefore ourselves)-- and that's a very conservative estimate.Listen-- if you're not squeamish about religious satire, and you don't mind comedy regarding body parts, sex, and mindless greed, you'll laugh your butt off.  Otherwise, stick to Bambi, or a sappy John Wayne movie, or The Ten Commandments, or whatever else floats your boat.",5,A great DARK comedy,1308182400,"06 16, 2011",2011,2304,"['just', 'got', 'be', 'one', 'funniest', 'dark', 'comedies', 'ever', 'made', 'Alternately', 'satirical', 'sweet', 'hilarious', 'insightful', 'Almost', 'institution', 'safe', 'satire-', 'religion', 'moral', 'hypocrisy', 'good', 'old', 'human', 'greed', 'are', 'primary', 'targets', 'artfully', 'intertwined', 'very', 'clever', 'entertaining', 'story', 'line.It', 'also', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'featuring', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'did', ""n't"", 'write', 'direct', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'plot', 'as', 'much', 'variety', 'typical', 'Allen', 'flik', 'David', 'Schwimmer', 'Sharon', 'Stone', 'Kiefer', 'Southerland', 'Cheech', 'Marin', 'Andy', 'Dick', 'Fran', 'Drescher', 'gorgeous', 'Maria', 'Grazia', 'Cucinotta', 'name', 'few.In', 'reading', 'negative', 'reviews', 'flik', 'would', 'seem', 'thinly-disguised', 'even', 'overt', 'moral', 'indignation', 'subject', 'matter', 'main', 'reason', 'discontent', 'Hmm', 'Methinks', 'doth', 'protest', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'many', 'folks', 'would', 'have', 'same', 'viewpoint', 'Trouble', 'Harry', 'Arsenic', 'Old', 'Lace', 'Eating', 'Raoul', 'Manhattan', 'Murder', 'Mystery', 'myriad', 'other', 'dark', 'comedies', 'murder', 'aftermath.Oh', 'right', 'THOSE', 'flix', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'fun', 'religion', 'mindless', 'mercenary', 'followers', 'few', 'sore', 'spots', 'course', 'one', 'would', 'have', 'excuse', 'anyone', 'who', 'had', 'family', 'member', 'friend', 'was', 'killed', 'finding', 'movie', 'distasteful', 'then', 'ANY', 'flick', 'murder', 'would', 'be', 'bounds', 'light', 'comedy', 'otherwise', 'Everyone', 'else', 'revisit', 'definition', 'dark', 'comedy', 'bitching', 'whining', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'really', 'really', 'funny', 'Oh', 'guy', 'who', 'said', 'stupidity', 'not', 'funny', 'Gee', 'wonder', 'what', 'Laurel', 'Hardy', 'Stooges', 'Marx', 'Brothers', 'would', 'say', 'considering', 'made', 'entire', 'career', 'lampooning', 'basic', 'stupidity', 'people', 'fact', ""'d"", 'say', 'good', '75', '%', 'humor', 'laughing', 'stupidity', 'misfortune', 'others', 'therefore', 'ourselves', 'very', 'conservative', 'estimate.Listen', ""'re"", 'not', 'squeamish', 'religious', 'satire', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'comedy', 'regarding', 'body', 'parts', 'sex', 'mindless', 'greed', ""'ll"", 'laugh', 'butt', 'Otherwise', 'stick', 'Bambi', 'sappy', 'John', 'Wayne', 'movie', 'Ten', 'Commandments', 'else', 'boat']",Picking Up the Pieces

It's a crazy comedy, with lots of surreal elements and an absurd plot. It's a story about a butcher who kills his wife, picking her to pieces. Accidentaly, he looses her hand, which is later found by a mexican bind woman, who believes she's cured by a miracle. Then, the news are spread, and the whole city of El Nino believes in the power of this hand.It may seem stupid, but it is actually a critic to fanatic people, who start believing in everything they see. The cast was well chosen. David Schwimmer plays a priest who is in love with a whore (shocking, isn't it?), proving that he can do more than Ross (Friends).
