999694,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,B000G8P1Y6,A Customer,"[8, 8]","Beautifully realized, The Miracle Match's strength - for non-soccer fans at least - is the fabulous recreation of 1950's period detail. The movie is mostly buoyed along by the strong performances and the admittedly great eye candy from its leading men, but oftentimes the film's energy stalls when it should be exciting and uplifting.Obviously soccer was nearly invisible on the US scene in the 1950's, but that didn't stop a rag-tag group of mostly Italian Americans from the Bronx neighborhood, an unembroidered hotbed of football talent from forming the American team and going up against the formidable English at the World Cup final in Brazil.It's indeed an incredible story of seemingly insurmountable triumph over adversity as the team was assembled almost literally overnight by Coach Bill Jeffrey (John Rhys-Davies) and promoter Walter Giesler (Craig Hawksley) who gave players only a few weeks for training and warm-up matches before flying to Rio.Rather than giving an in-depth account of the players individual lives, director David Anspaugh has chosen to paint a wider canvas, spreading the dramatic interest over seven major characters not including the coach, a sportswriter, a couple of wives and one key opponent. And of course they're probably the best-looking bunch of guys you will ever see on film.Mr. hunk Gerard Butler plays the key player; goalie Frank Borghi, whose athleticism in front of the net saves his team time after time. Rounding out the squad are Jay Rodan as ""Pee Wee"" Wallace, a boisterous party guy with a deathly fear of flying; Louis Mandylor as Gino Pariani, whose wedding moves up to accommodate the team schedule; Zachery Bryan as Harry Keough, a local mail carrier; and Costas Mandylor as ""Gloves"" Columbo, the team enforcer.All the actors do well at portraying these - mostly - well-mannered young men who come together from different backgrounds to play for the common cause. Although clashes happen when the boys are placed under the tutelage of Walter Bahr (Wes Bentley) a focused college graduate from the East Coast who virtually manages the team given the coach's indifference and lack of faith.The bad news about Miracle Match is that most of the team tends to get lost in the shuffle with only team captains Wes Bentley and Gerard Butler distinguishing themselves before the film is over. The dialogue is often clich&eacute;d treacle and the music - rather than complement the action - makes certain key scenes come across as relentlessly corny.However, the good news is that there are several genuinely moving moments - the final match is especially exiting and compelling. The producers also deserve credit for insisting on location shoots in St. Louis - where many of the players on the 1950 team lived - and Brazil. The result is a great sense of time and place, which makes our intrepid heroes so much easier to root for.

Erland,"[2, 3]","`The Miracle Match' released in '05 is a nostalgic, well intentioned re-enactment of the events leading up to the '50 World Cup match played in Brazil between the U.S.A. and the number 1 ranked team in the world, England.There is a lot of good things to say about this film. The production values are superior and the settings perfectly capture the feel and tempo of the time. The cast is also excellent and works well together. Unfortunately, there are also several shortcomings in the film:1) Poor character development.2) A rather contrived scene concerning the passing out of the team uniforms apparently designed to inspire patriotism and magnify the importance of the impending soccer match. I have nothing against patriotism, just didn't like the silly manner in which it was worked into the script.3) The best moments of the movie are off the field of play. The anti-climatic big game with England is more of a letdown than the defining moment of the film as it should be.Overall ""The Miracle Match' is an enjoyable, uplifting family film worth a view.

999703,A328S9RN3U5M68,B000G8P1Y6,Grady Harp,"[1, 2]","THE MIRACLE MATCH (released rather unsuccessfully in the theaters as THE GAME OF THEIR LIVES) is yet another one of those feel good movies that dwells on the concept that the problems of humanity can be resolved on the playing field.  And that is not a bad metaphor: wouldn't it be great if current world problems could be worked out under the guidelines of teamwork?The film is a heartwarming look at the true story of a 1950's event when a US Soccer team was created in St. Louis, Missouri, the core of the team being from Italian families in the La Montagna area of St. Louis and augmented from teams across the country, traveled to Brazil and defeated the English team in the World Cup Soccer event - a fact that startled the sports world.  The St. Louis boys include Gerard Butler (yes, the film was made in 2005 and yet Butler looks younger and speaks without his brogue), Jay Rodan, Costas Mandylor, Louis Mandylor, Zachery Ty Bryan, Jimmy Jean-Louis, Richard Jenik and Nelson Vargas.  They all do well, giving us the feeling that they are fully attuned to the story.  The other actors (including a bit part by Patrick Stewart) handle their rather weakly written parts adequately.The problem with the film, though probably quite accurate in reporting a true incident (the real and surviving original players form the team are included in the rather corny ending), is that we really don't get to know the personalities of the team players well enough to create a successful drama.  The majority of the film is shot during soccer games and that becomes monotonous to those of us who are not soccer devotees.  But given that problem, the film has a sweetness about it and an honesty that while bordering on saccharine does indeed emphasize the team spirit needed to conquer all odds.  And in the end it is worth watching to view Gerard Butler in yet another type of character: the actor is well on the rise!

If so, the movie title is a spoiler: ""The Miracle Team""! What do ""miracle teams"" do? They come from the underdog position to win!The cobbled team of St. Louis-New York players won the World Cup in the 1950 Championship game against the world's best team and best player in a 1-0 victory. How did it happen? How could this major sports upset even conceivably take place? After try-outs, two weeks of practice, and personal, ethnic, religious, and regional clashes of differences, the team finally jelled, even during the game for this sports coup.Do you know the applied meanings of Apollonian and Dionysian styles of doing things? The New York team was Apollonian--structured, intellectual, controlled. The St. Louis team, comprised of Italians from the famous Hill area, was Dionysian (think god of wine)--loose, fun-loving, instantaneous.The two styles were a major conflict. New York was led by a man of German-descent, Walter Bahr (some of these men from St. Louis had served in World War II). St. Louis's leader, Frank Gorghi, was the go-to guy in leaving words of wisdom and guidance, while Walter was a cool, calculating, but also wise leader. The two were able to work together and make the team eventually click. Going against the manager's decision, they went as a unified front to convince Joe Gaetjens, an African player attending school in America, a natural athlete, and later the soul of the team, to play.Breaking elements down:PRO:1. Considering that the movie was made by the same people making HOOSIERS and RUDY, both exciting sports movies, this movie was criticized for lacking that same excitement. I found the championship game most exciting and was on my feet cheering most of the time!2. A major point is that the story was made into a movie enjoyable to watch, good for a family entertainment. Maybe another group later can remake it to include what other reviewers saw as weaknesses.3. Only two actors' names stand out (Gerard Butler and Patrick Stewart). I liked the use of little known or unknown actors. It makes the viewer not single out favorites to watch. I know Gerard Butler is getting to be a big name now, but not at the time the movie was made.4. The film looks professional. It is not an embarrassment for the celebration of this major American sports event or the players.CONS1. Lack of character development. There was enough for the viewer to get a working knowledge of each one's background or some little aspect of his character, but not enough.2. What happened to the players after this major game? Viewers always want this information just out of curiosity. Did the game change them? Not change them?3. One reviewer criticized the use of the sports reporter narrating part of the story to give background and explanations. This technique is not an uncommon use of characters. I saw nothing wrong with it. It gave a Greek chorus kind of narration.Overall, ""The Miracle Match"" is a highly satisfying movie. I watched it a second time recently and discovered to my major surprise that I immensely enjoyed the movie much more this time. At the first viewing, I was not really into watching soccer.This is a great movie to watch on July 4th, or in celebration of the American spirit to win at all odds, just like the revolutionists did in 1776.

Saw it in a theater with only 3 other people - at noon, on a Monday, raining - but it didn't matter because I was engaged and wrapped up in the 1950's  story of a bunch of ordinary guys who did something extraordinary.Based on a real event with real, still living, people it is about heros of WWII who came home and went about their lives until asked to form a team for the World Cup Soccer matches.  They have only weeks and decide to get some players from the east coast and some from one area of St. Louis, MO. from the Italian enclave known as The Hill.Frank Borghi (Gerard Butler) is the goalie and a leader of the group.  The challenge is to get the whole group to pull together and mesh the different styles to make a team that may make a good showing.  They don't expect to win as most of the teams they will play are more or less professionals and/or have played together for years.The soccer playing is exciting even for this old gal who knows little about the game.  The cinematography is very good and keeps the pace of the game and shots of the crowds and sports announcers ticking along and by the end when time runs out on the English players, and the Americans have won this great upset, I was ready to cheer too.I disagree with most of the reviews I have read.  This is a good sports movie and the performances and pacing are as good as ""Rudy"" or any other underdog film.One thing I loved was the look of the people and homes and cars.

As a fan of Gerard Butler, I especially enjoyed his performance as Frank Borghi, the captain and the emotional lynchpin of the USA World Cup team that accomplished an extraordinary upset defeat of Great Britain. Half of the team members came from an old Italian neighborhood in St. Louis (where it was filmed on location), and the other half from an Ivy League background. More drama about this culture clash would have been interesting, but was unfortunately minimized, as was the fact that several of the team members were decorated heroes of the Korean War.The other performances are excellent as well, and I always enjoy seeing Louis Mandylor. This was a difficult film to make because the director had to find actors who could play soccer, rather than soccer players who could act. The scenes on the playing field are authentic and exciting, especially the climactic win in Brazil. Patrick Stewart's narration, on the other hand, was stiff and tended to overstate the obvious. John Rhys-Davies as the team's coach was oddly detached, which suggested that he was uninterested in their performance and doubted their capabilities. Was this true? Did they pull together as a team despite their coach?Soccer films are few and far between, and attract very little attention, kind of like this historic game itself.

The book is a classic in discussing that team and that game and I think much better than the movie which seems highly revisionist. No such revisions are needed.Action wise, this is one of the best soccer movies yet for the filming of plays on the field much in the way, that 'Hoosiers' is a triumph in basketball. You do get a good feel for a real soccer game from this movie. The soccer footage I find enjoyable as in the 'Goal' movies, 'Victory' and a ""Shot at glory.'Factually, I believe it has been embellished too much and in fact, fabricated, forget about the arguments as to how good England were, Ireland Republic defeated England within a year prior to this match 2-0 in what I believe was the first time a foreign team won on English soil (fellow United Kingdom teams Wales and Scotland, the latter doing so with regularity, had managed to defeat England in England a number of times) so England were not invincible and forget about our USA team losing to Chile and Spain (we actually led Spain in our 1st game, 1-0 with 10 minutes to go and ended up losing 3-1, so we must not have been pushovers) in that World Cup in regards to this single game, I believe the story line is still true and that this is one of the greatest upsets of all time since the US was such a backwater soccer/football nation. When Cameroon defeated reigning World Cup champion Argentina in 1990, Cameroon was still a nation where soccer is a primary sport. The same can be said about the handful of other examples that can be used for similar upsets, Algeria vs. West Germany, North Korea vs. Italy, Senegal vs. France, etc.. The US team that defeated England in 1950 had results like these in the immediate years prior: Mexico 5 USA 0, Cuba 5 USA 2, Norway 11 USA 0 ( ref: elo ratings web pages) and finally, in September of 1949, we defeated Cuba 5-2: so we were far from being formidable competition on the world stage. This is what made the victory so staggering, it was so unexpected, so out of the blue. A modern day comparison might be say, if we saw Canada, no offense meant, defeat someone like Holland in the World Cup, it would be shocking though in fairness, I do believe the Canadians often hold their own alright in playing our National team.Yet, I believe the producers and writers of the screenplay play a bit too fast and loose with the original story. The book seems even-handed in telling about all of the players, this movie is largely about the St. Louis based players, 4 in total of the team and certainly does merit mention and probably being central to the story but possibly not at the total expense of other team members of which some, there is close to nil. Additionally, I would agree with some reviewers who would say the English team are made to be somewhat villains in this movie, perhaps upper class snootish snobbish types, heck, they almost seem cut out of the same cloth as that Russian Rocky Balboa boxed in that one movie, Ivan Drago. The truth is back in those days, an English footballer received relatively low wages compared to today, some pay packets only a bit higher than those earned by factory workers. I don't want to give away any of the plot element and after all, we know of the final outcome here, but from my reading, some facts don't mesh with the movies version. The famed soccer star Sir Stanley Matthews doesn't play against the USA because in the movie he's taking a ""holiday"" in Rio, by the way, the first chapter of the book states Sir Stan was sitting out the USA game because he was seen ""limping briefly"" in the days before the USA/England match. The truth of the matter is, is Sir Stan wasn't picked to play in this game from his own voluminous autobiographyThe Way It Was: My Autobiography. England had won its 3 preceding games without Stanley Matthews so the basic team was not changed at all as they thought it was good enough and there were no substitutes back then. Matthews was at the game watching as part of the reserves team for England. I'd also scrutinize the portrayal of Haitian Joe Gaetjens. Finding other inconsistencies, I can't help but feel much of the narrative here does not reflect the reality of the original game though, the movie does bring out a possible truth that Gaetjens, our goal scorer may have felt a bit at home in Brazil and in the mannerisms of that country, not a bad angle. Lastly, the St. Louis guys seem to spend a good amount of time in the bar as well, okay, I guess one can take some creative license there but it does make me wonder if they spent time sipping brews in this manner.Stanley Mortensen who was half-Norweigan by the way, one player on the English National team is portrayed making an arrogant speech at a joint dinner banquet with the English and American teams attending, the speech is a somewhat anti-American speech and incendiary, ""Gloves"" walks out of the speech. I searched the book but this is not in there. What is the source of this speech?? Stanley Mortensen in fact served on a RAF fighter plane that went down during World War II, he was the only one to survive. Injuries he sustained in that crash were thought to be so serious as to end his soccer career altogether but he came back. Is this the one who made that speech at that banquet?? Also, it would seem highly unlikely to see Mortensen's talking about cricket and also, disparage baseball when in fact, baseball is much like the sport ""rounders"" played in the United Kingdom (for better or worst, the author ofSoccer in a Football World: The Story of America's Forgotten Game (Sporting)goes so far as to say it originated over there). Revising the story does not truly honor this original team whose great accomplishment speaks for itself. The whole scenario I believe is fundamentally changed.If one is fictionalizing the story, what is to keep one from say, supposing the Italian referee sided with the American team which had some Italian-heritage players like Pariani and Borghi? I doubt if a screen writer named Angelo Pizzo would see it in that manner but why not at least, seek the truth? Tom Finney who played for England that day writes that two obvious penalties for England were waved off, furthermore, in the two previous years, England had marked up 2-0 and 4-0 victories against Italy. So, certainly, there is a need to be honest.To use a comparison, a recently well made sports movie in my opinion is 'The Express, the Ernie Davis story' which claims it is ""inspired by real events"" on the dvd case and even carries a disclaimer at the end concerning the events portrayed in a game purported to take place in West Virginia which it says are fictitious. While the verdict is out, 'Express' seems to still be a fair historical appraisal of that era.  'The miracle match' movie also called 'The game of their lives' is a two or three star movie because while the acting and filming is very good, not a bad story-line except it seemingly, has little to do with historical accuracy and, though you might say ""everyone does it"", it could even be construed as malicious and possibly defamatory.",2,USA win in 1950 was a great accomplishment in itself;

999725,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000G8P1Y6,Tsuyoshi,"[6, 11]","Let me say first that I am a big fan of football (or soccer if you like), and I know something about the `Game' of the film. Geoffrey Douglas's original book is translated into Japanese, and the World Cup is now one of the biggest sports events in Japan. And this decently-made film stars Gerard Butler so brilliant in `the Phantom of the Opera,' Patrick Stewart (as cameo) and Wes Bentley.So why three stars? For all good acting from the cast, credible atmosphere of the year 1950, and the enthusiasm of the cast and the crew, I am truly afraid that `The Game of Their Lives' would not be likely to the minds of the viewers of the country about soccer, where baseball or basketball is more popular than soccer. I am not saying that the film is bad. The formulaic film is, so to speak, too faithful (to this I come back later).I like this kind of story, about underdogs winning in the end. But we need something more in this kind of film, some well-drawn characters you can relate to. Here, Butler as Frank Borghi the ace goal keeper from St. Louis, and Bentley, Walter Bahr from East Coast players, are the central characters, both leading the rag-tag amateur team, which everybody thought would be going to lose. And lose miserably against England.Though the film's soccer scenes are done credibly, each character's personality outside the field is that of cardboard character, including its dialogues and reference to voodoo, and the clash of personalities between the two groups is overcome so easily. More annoying is the very shadowy, near-nonentity existence of England team and its ace striker Stanley Mortenson. If you know nothing about soccer and its history, you would not see why winning this particular game means so much to the American platers. The film provides some background knowledge, but it is like footnotes of a classic novel, something you keep in mind, but not the exciting content itself that you should feel.[I LOVE FOOTBALL BUT...] OK, this is not complaint. But soccer is kind of sports that do not allow you to take liberties with the actual events very much. You cannot just make `Cool Runnings' (one of my favorite films) if you want to make it look like real, and they made it look like real in this film. Unlike baseball, American football, or basketball games, sometimes (or often) you witness not many scores in soccer. There is no dramatic grand slam homer getting even in the ninth inning in `Games of Their Lives' and that's what I meant by `faithful.' I admire the decision not to dramatize the material, but maybe some viewers might think otherwise.Perhaps I couldn't bring myself to share the enthusiastic views of many other reviewers because I know this is not the only `surprise' in the long history of FIFA and the World Cup (the victory of North Korea against Italy in 1966, for example). Or maybe I know though the results of the game described here are correct, American team lost other two games (against Spain and Chili). Or more probably, that's because the film ignores the historical context of soccer in USA, where as the retired reporter (played by Patrick Stewart with heavy accent) says, soccer is getting more popular than before, but still the sports itself was not always so (as in the late 80s when there was no professional league) even after that victory in 1950.But again I say this is a decent film with inspirational material. I only wish that the filmmakers added something more - something that would tell us about the sports or the players themselves -- to the story.",3,Good Historical Reminder Needs More Drama Among the Characters,1140393600,"02 20, 2006",2006,3538,"['Let', 'say', 'first', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'football', 'soccer', 'like', 'know', 'something', 'Game', 'film', 'Geoffrey', 'Douglas', 'original', 'book', 'translated', 'Japanese', 'World', 'Cup', 'now', 'one', 'biggest', 'sports', 'events', 'Japan', 'decently-made', 'film', 'stars', 'Gerard', 'Butler', 'so', 'brilliant', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'cameo', 'Wes', 'Bentley.So', 'why', 'three', 'stars', 'good', 'acting', 'cast', 'credible', 'atmosphere', 'year', '1950', 'enthusiasm', 'cast', 'crew', 'am', 'truly', 'afraid', 'Game', 'Their', 'Lives', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'likely', 'minds', 'viewers', 'country', 'soccer', 'where', 'baseball', 'basketball', 'more', 'popular', 'soccer', 'am', 'not', 'saying', 'film', 'bad', 'formulaic', 'film', 'so', 'speak', 'too', 'faithful', 'come', 'back', 'later', '.I', 'kind', 'story', 'underdogs', 'winning', 'end', 'need', 'something', 'more', 'kind', 'film', 'well-drawn', 'characters', 'can', 'relate', 'Here', 'Butler', 'Frank', 'Borghi', 'ace', 'goal', 'keeper', 'St.', 'Louis', 'Bentley', 'Walter', 'Bahr', 'East', 'Coast', 'players', 'are', 'central', 'characters', 'leading', 'rag-tag', 'amateur', 'team', 'everybody', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'going', 'lose', 'lose', 'miserably', 'England.Though', 'film', 'soccer', 'scenes', 'are', 'done', 'credibly', 'character', 'personality', 'field', 'cardboard', 'character', 'including', 'dialogues', 'reference', 'voodoo', 'clash', 'personalities', 'two', 'groups', 'overcome', 'so', 'easily', 'More', 'annoying', 'very', 'shadowy', 'near-nonentity', 'existence', 'England', 'team', 'ace', 'striker', 'Stanley', 'Mortenson', 'know', 'nothing', 'soccer', 'history', 'would', 'not', 'see', 'why', 'winning', 'particular', 'game', 'so', 'much', 'American', 'platers', 'film', 'background', 'knowledge', 'footnotes', 'classic', 'novel', 'something', 'keep', 'mind', 'not', 'exciting', 'content', 'should', 'feel', '[', 'LOVE', 'FOOTBALL', 'BUT', ']', 'OK', 'not', 'complaint', 'soccer', 'kind', 'sports', 'do', 'not', 'allow', 'take', 'liberties', 'actual', 'events', 'very', 'much', 'can', 'not', 'just', 'make', 'Cool', 'Runnings', 'one', 'favorite', 'films', 'want', 'make', 'look', 'real', 'made', 'look', 'real', 'film', 'baseball', 'American', 'football', 'basketball', 'games', 'sometimes', 'often', 'witness', 'not', 'many', 'scores', 'soccer', 'dramatic', 'grand', 'slam', 'homer', 'getting', 'even', 'ninth', 'inning', 'Games', 'Their', 'Lives', 'what', 'meant', 'faithful', 'admire', 'decision', 'not', 'dramatize', 'material', 'maybe', 'viewers', 'might', 'think', 'otherwise.Perhaps', 'could', ""n't"", 'bring', 'share', 'enthusiastic', 'views', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'know', 'not', 'only', 'surprise', 'long', 'history', 'FIFA', 'World', 'Cup', 'victory', 'North', 'Korea', 'Italy', '1966', 'example', 'maybe', 'know', 'results', 'game', 'described', 'here', 'are', 'correct', 'American', 'team', 'lost', 'other', 'two', 'games', 'Spain', 'Chili', 'more', 'probably', 'film', 'historical', 'context', 'soccer', 'USA', 'where', 'retired', 'reporter', 'played', 'Patrick', 'Stewart', 'heavy', 'accent', 'soccer', 'getting', 'more', 'popular', 'before', 'still', 'sports', 'was', 'not', 'always', 'so', 'late', '80s', 'when', 'was', 'professional', 'league', 'even', 'victory', '1950.But', 'again', 'say', 'decent', 'film', 'inspirational', 'material', 'only', 'wish', 'filmmakers', 'added', 'something', 'more', 'something', 'would', 'tell', 'sports', 'players', 'story']",N/A

The original budget of $65 M was whittled down to $27 M, causing the running time of 130 minutes to be shortened to 101. Scriptwriter Angelo Pizzo, who based his story on the book by Geoffrey Douglas, says that only 45-50% of what he intended to be in the film made it to the final cut. Scenes like Frank ""Pee Wee"" Wallace as a German POW, and an emotional scene of the players looking up the records of their ancestors on Ellis Island, were dropped. Those were scenes that would have given the characters more depth and made the story more interesting. Instead, we are left with a predictably formulaic sports film about an underdog American soccer team beating the inventors of the sport, Great Britain, in the 1950 Olympic Games. Period. While interesting and likable, it leaves much to be desired as far as drama.I didn't like the way everything had to be explained by the narrator, reporter Dent McSkimming, played by Patrick Stewart. Perhaps the scenes that would have explained things were part of the film that was cut, and that was the only option left to the filmmakers. I liked Gerard Butler as goalie Frank Borghi, the star of the team, and the player who had been most decorated in WWII; but it wasn't one of his stronger roles. He had plenty to do on the field, but not that much dramatically off. Wes Bentley as Walter Bahr, Jay Rodan as Pee Wee Wallace, Gavin Rossdale as Brit Stanley Mortensen, Costas Mandylor as Charlie ""Gloves"" Columbo, Louis Mandylor as Gino Pariani, Zachery Ty Bryan as Harry Keough, and especially Jimmy Jean-Louis as Joe Gaetjens were all good. These were good actors playing good characters. It is a shame the studio didn't allow them to show their stuff more.This is a very likable film that was cheated by the studio. My only hope is that one day someone will finance a director's cut version so we can see what we missed, though that is highly unlikely since I don't think those extra scenes were even shot. If that were to happen, it might turn out that this actually was a great film, worthy of the company of RUDY and HOOSIERS.By the way: the DVD contains no extras - not one. When was the last time that occurred?
