146826,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,0792841433,Andrew Ellington,"[1, 1]","I'm glad I'm not the only person who, while watching `Le Mariee Etait en Noir', thought of `Kill Bill'.  I mean, there are obvious comparisons to be made, and it is certainly respectable that Tarantino would be influenced by someone as marvelously influential as Francois Truffaut.  Personally, I adore him.  `Jules et Jim' is my favorite movie of all time, and a few of Truffaut's other films are not far behind.  While I don't think he's quite as great as Jean-Luc Godard (a cinematic obsession of mine), but I am not one of those who thinks you have to pick a side (cough*FriedrichNietzsche*cough).`La Mariee Etait en Noir' tells the story of a woman scorned.  That woman is Julie Kohler, a woman who spent her whole life loving one man only to have him shot and killed on the day of their wedding.  She has spent her years since tracking down the men responsible and delivering the same fate they offered her husband.What is so intriguing about this film is that, when all is said and done, the revelation behind the killing is not what we would have expected; not at all.  I think that this clever twist is perfectly used here, for it delivers conflicting emotions to the audience.  I don't want to uncover the twist, because for me it was the most profound part of the film, but I will say that it causes you to question your side of the battle so-to-speak.The Hitchcock influence is all over this film.  What I love about it though, is that it understood how to make it fresh and new.  This doesn't feel like Hitchcock-lite, or like a deliberate copycat.  This isn't mimicry as much as homage.  Truffaut still makes this very much is own film, allowing the jovial French cinematic atmosphere to lend its own set of layers to this thriller.  You can also thank the beautifully talented Jeanne Moreau for delivering an outstanding performance.  She captures the coldness that chips away to reveal true emotional duress, especially when she learns the truth.  I also love the way you can see her playing the part.  She plays the reserved flirt rather well, using her sensuality to attack, but always keeping that prickly demeanor that almost enticing the audience all the more.The film, and especially the calculated murders, are not really meant to be taken too seriously.  This is a thriller, but it is more about the psychological effect the situation is having on Julie.  As with the best of Hitchcock, `Le Mariee Etait en Noir' is most appreciated when one takes the time to dig a little deeper.",5,Somewhere between Hitchcock and Tarantino...,1276214400,"06 11, 2010",2010,2504,"[""'m"", 'glad', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'watching', 'Le', 'Mariee', 'Etait', 'en', 'Noir', 'thought', 'Kill', 'Bill', 'mean', 'are', 'obvious', 'comparisons', 'be', 'made', 'certainly', 'respectable', 'Tarantino', 'would', 'be', 'influenced', 'someone', 'marvelously', 'influential', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'Personally', 'adore', 'Jules', 'et', 'Jim', 'favorite', 'movie', 'time', 'few', 'Truffaut', 'other', 'films', 'are', 'not', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'quite', 'as', 'great', 'Jean-Luc', 'Godard', 'cinematic', 'obsession', 'mine', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'who', 'thinks', 'have', 'pick', 'side', 'cough*FriedrichNietzsche*cough', 'La', 'Mariee', 'Etait', 'en', 'Noir', 'story', 'woman', 'scorned', 'woman', 'Julie', 'Kohler', 'woman', 'who', 'spent', 'whole', 'life', 'loving', 'one', 'man', 'only', 'have', 'shot', 'killed', 'day', 'wedding', 'spent', 'years', 'tracking', 'down', 'men', 'responsible', 'delivering', 'same', 'fate', 'offered', 'husband.What', 'so', 'intriguing', 'film', 'when', 'said', 'done', 'revelation', 'killing', 'not', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'expected', 'not', 'think', 'clever', 'twist', 'perfectly', 'used', 'here', 'conflicting', 'emotions', 'audience', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'uncover', 'twist', 'was', 'most', 'profound', 'part', 'film', 'will', 'say', 'question', 'side', 'battle', 'so-to-speak.The', 'Hitchcock', 'influence', 'film', 'What', 'love', 'understood', 'how', 'make', 'fresh', 'new', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Hitchcock-lite', 'deliberate', 'copycat', ""n't"", 'mimicry', 'as', 'much', 'homage', 'Truffaut', 'still', 'very', 'much', 'own', 'film', 'allowing', 'jovial', 'French', 'cinematic', 'atmosphere', 'lend', 'own', 'set', 'layers', 'thriller', 'can', 'also', 'thank', 'beautifully', 'talented', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'delivering', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'coldness', 'chips', 'away', 'reveal', 'true', 'emotional', 'duress', 'especially', 'when', 'truth', 'also', 'love', 'way', 'can', 'see', 'playing', 'part', 'reserved', 'flirt', 'rather', 'well', 'using', 'sensuality', 'attack', 'always', 'keeping', 'prickly', 'demeanor', 'almost', 'enticing', 'audience', 'more.The', 'film', 'especially', 'calculated', 'murders', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'meant', 'be', 'taken', 'too', 'seriously', 'thriller', 'more', 'psychological', 'effect', 'situation', 'having', 'Julie', 'best', 'Hitchcock', 'Le', 'Mariee', 'Etait', 'en', 'Noir', 'most', 'appreciated', 'when', 'one', 'time', 'dig', 'little', 'deeper']",N/A

It has a lot in common with B-movies such as the Theatre of Blood (1973 - Vincent Price), where all you get to expect is a series of killings.

Truffaut has been dead for awhile now but for several decades, ending in the 1980s, he was probably the most popular French director for American moviegoers newly discovering French film.  One thing that made him so accessible to Americans was that he started out as a movie reviewer and also wrote a definitive book on the work of Alfred Hitchcock.  Truffaut understood what we Americans were drawn to at the movies but could also make it a new experience for us by making it French. This movie is an homage to Hitchcock's work yet also distinctly Truffaut's movie.  The marvelous Jeanne Moreau plays the lead, a woman hell bent on revenging her husband's murder.  She systematically goes after and murders each man who was in any way involved in gunning her husband down on their wedding day. She of course has to get rather close to each man in question to pull this off and she is wonderfully inventive in her methods. Perhaps her best &quot;sendoff&quot; is saved for last though.

146829,A2GCHG6U8HTVIT,0792841433,C. O. DeRiemer,"[4, 5]","Truffaut said The Bride Wore Black was his homage to Hitchcock. A great homage it is, with that Bernard Herrmann score, murderous psychological ambiguity, bad things happening on warm, sunlit days and a complex -- and looney -- main character. Think of it as a black comedy with enough riffs on Vertigo to smile at. Just as importantly, while the film may be Truffaut's homage to Hitchcock, the film remains completely Truffaut's. It's one of his best, and features a wonderful performance by Jeanne Moreau as a woman whose husband is shot and killed as they're standing on the church steps just after they've been married. After recovering from the shock, depression and a suicide attempt, Julie Kohler decides to do something about the five men responsible. If you are unfortunate enough to hear the whispered words, ""Je suis Julie Kohler,"" they will be the last words you'll ever hear.Julie methodically checks off the names on her list as she finds ways to see that her version of justice is done. She may be obsessed, but she knows exactly what she's doing...and she is implacable. Jeanne Moreau, with those plump, downward-turning lips and puffy smoker's eyes, has never been better. Moreau is an extraordinary actress. She had features that at times could seem almost coarse, but then almost beautiful and certainly desirable. She had a strange fusion of intelligence which challenged and a vastly intriguing nature. I could easily picture her watching Casanova with those reserved, quiet eyes while he struggled to mumble self-consciously, ""I love you."" Moreau can do more with a stare, a look, a glance than just about any actress I know.As much as the movie is a joy to watch, the last five minutes has a conclusion that is unexpected and completely satisfying. I think even Hitchcock would have had a smile on his face as he patted Truffaut on the back.The Bride Wore Black has a fine DVD transfer. It is not anamorphic. There are no extras of any importance. Let's hope it gets reissued not only anamorphic, but with the substantial extras on Truffaut and Moreau the film deserves. For those fans of Truffaut and Hitchcock, you may find of interest Hitchcock (Revised Edition) by Helen G. Scott and Francois Truffaut.

146833,A28GPUB0FABLV2,0792841433,"Eric ""seric26""","[0, 0]","This is an intriguing film. There are a lot of odd choices in it that make it distinctive. It's in lush color, uniformly brightly lit. The fashions are dramatic, and for Moreau, mostly variations on black or white. Which is fitting, as she's an avenging angel, acting on a moral imperative.Though, to her victims, she's a femme fatale, the film interestingly does not demonize her. As the story unfolds, we learn her reasoning, and she is insanely dedicated to efficiently targeting her victims. She doesn't allow for innocents to get caught in the crossfire.Perhaps most interesting of all is Moreau's performance; she rarely smiles, in fact underplays every scene. So we're left with the beautiful enigmatic presence of a woman acting as she must, by her own moral reckoning, alienated from the rules and constraints of society. One minute of confession finally lets us in to the pain under her stony visage; yet even that is intercut with flashbacks and underlined by Hermann's expressive score.Truffaut's Hitchcock homage works on several levels, not least of which is each of the varied guises the bride wears to snare her foes. She makes herself into their perfect object before killing them, and they make it all to easy for her. And yet each encounter is distinct, a portrait of the character of the man who wronged her as much as of Julie herself.Most unusual of all, perhaps due to the Hitchcock influence, is how old-fashioned the movie is. The narrative is so direct, so visual and so well-plotted, there's none of the verite' or hand-held moves that were making other films look natural and experimental at the time. The look is more 1960 or 1964 than 1968; it must have looked old-fashioned even at the time.

Right now I'm immersed in the films of Franois Truffaut, and that is a hell of a lot of English sub-titles to read. But, okay, who amongst us couldn't do with the occasional dip into artsy-fartsy French cinema? C'mon, man, get your culture on. Eat a snail.His stylish nod to the films of Alfred Hitchcock finds Franois Truffaut at his least Truffautesque. Chain-smoking pundits in berets and turtlenecks won't be referencing 1968's THE BRIDE WORE BLACK (""La Mari&eacute;e &eacute;tait en noir"") any time soon as what's indicative of the French New Wave movement. Truffaut does make some interesting filmmaking choices but it's a film that's far from a ""self-conscious rejection of traditional cinema structure,"" which is the bread and butter of the French New Wave.It's about as close as Truffaut gets to the straightforward suspense thriller. In it we see Jeanne Moreau's character embark on a dark vengeful road. Julie Kohler (Moreau) seeks the deaths of the five men who killed her husband on her wedding day. Because what else is there to do once one mucks up one's suicide? I don't know that Truffaut intends the film audience to sympathize with Julie Kohler, although, okay, there is one instance in which she deliberately calls the police to clear the schoolteacher arrested for a murder Kohler had committed. But while we do catch fleeting glimpses of a shattered Julie Kohler, for the most part Moreau plays her as an enigmatic femme fatale, emotionless and methodical and utterly purposeful in her quest. Only ever dressed in stark black and white, she gives off this impersonal Angel of Death vibe. There's a fatalistic pulse and a sense of melancholia that grips you, even as that same melancholia eludes our lethal black widow. We never catch the sense that Moreau's character will reconsider and step away from her compulsion for revenge. It doesn't matter at all that several of her targets aren't entirely unsympathetic.For someone like me, who hasn't seen too many of Truffaut's works, THE BRIDE WORE BLACK serves as a sort of primer. There's enough jarring stuff in there, enough unconventional storytelling and artistic conceits in there, that it works to set me up for Truffaut's other, more New Wavy stuff. As a fan of Hitchcock, I appreciate the film for its suspenseful components and visual flair. Bernard Herrman's lush score accentuates the mood and stresses those ties to Hitchcock.

146837,A1W62UQWNZMM55,0792841433,"""infinitemovies""","[3, 3]","When THE BRIDE WORE BLACK first came out to theaters Hitchcock went out to see it for himself. He had been good friends with Truffaut already for a while and Truffaut had been an admirer of his for a long time. After Hitch saw it he told Truffaut what he thought. His only thought was that in one of the murder scenes a pillow should have been put under the head of one of the men who was dying. But other than that he gave his seal of approval and so do i. This is one of the best homages to Hitchcock that i have ever seen. The story is adapted from a novel by William Irish and it is about a woman named Julie Kohler (Jeanne Moreau- Jules and Jim, Viva Maria!) who's husband is shot and killed on her wedding day. After living for a long time in deep depression she decides to track down the five men who killed her husband (accidentally) and kill them one by one. She uses her charms to get to them and soon after she kills them. The movie is not unbearably suspenseful but it is potent enough so that you wonder what will happen next. The reason for it not being so suspenseful is that you can guess more or less what will happen but what does keep it  suspenseful and interesting  is that we don't know how these situations will turn out. Truffaut's direction keeps the movie flowing along at a constant pace and he uses wardrobe to convey how Julie is feeling by having her wear black very often and if she does wear any other color it is only white. Jeanne Moreau gives a subtle and sympathetic performance in a role in which she could have gone over the top but wisely chose not to. We sympathize with her even as she is commiting these horrible crimes because Truffaut has us understand her pain but never fully. The psychological aspect which could have been exlpored more in this movie is never fully explored but it's not unforgiveable since the movie is not really about that. It's more about Julie's experience of trying to get her revenge. The script is solid as well and the movie is accompanied by a beautiful score by Bernard Herrmann who was Hitchcock's frequent collaborator and the score is reminiscent of Hitchcock's VERTIGO and MARNIE.

I was pleased to fimd it had lost none of it's power to entertain.Although it was well received, particularly by the art house crowd, when it was released it is now a largely ignored film. This is a pitty as it is superbly crafted and despite a somewhat absurd plot conconcerning a widowed bride avenging the assassination of her husband it does draw the viewer into it and you cannot help but wonder how it will all be resolved.The Bride Wore Black was Francois Truffaut's second colour film and like his first, Fahrenhight 451(1966), he makes strong use of primery colours namly red, blue, white and black. In particular his decision to dress Julie Kohler(Jeanne Moreau) only in black and white is extreamely effective and each of her five victims is treated to a different creation in black or white and sometimes both; each designed to lure it's respective man to his fate.  Jeanne Moreau gives an amazing performance in the title role for however alluring she appears to her victims(they all fall in love with her) her eyes are always filled with cold hatred for them.This film is, above all, a tribute to the master of suspence himself Alfred Hitchcock; Bernard Herrmann's music and the slightly cold lighting together with the restrained style of acting combine to make a French version of an unmistakeable cocktail as deadly as the  poisoned Arrack Julie gives to Bliss, her second victim. But The Bride Wore Black is a lot better than the films that Hitchcock was comming out with at around the time this was made namely &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;(1967) and &quot;Topaz&quot;(1969).Although the DVD does not appear to have been digitally restored the original print from which it has been made is good and if you don't want to be distracted by subtitles you have the option to view the film with a dubbed English language soundtrack, although the American accents sound a bit strange eminating from all thoes French actors.Although to modern audiences this may apear a bit camp this is a &quot;must have&quot; for any lover of French New Wave Cinema.",5,Truffaut's Hitchcock homage is better than the real thing!,981504000,"02 7, 2001",2001,2180,"['buying', 'DVD', ""'d"", 'only', 'seen', 'film', 'twice', 'times', 'television', 'last', 'time', '13', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'pleased', 'fimd', 'had', 'lost', 'none', 'power', 'entertain.Although', 'was', 'well', 'received', 'particularly', 'art', 'house', 'crowd', 'when', 'was', 'released', 'now', 'largely', 'ignored', 'film', 'pitty', 'superbly', 'crafted', 'somewhat', 'absurd', 'plot', 'conconcerning', 'widowed', 'bride', 'avenging', 'assassination', 'husband', 'draw', 'viewer', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'wonder', 'how', 'will', 'all', 'be', 'resolved.The', 'Bride', 'Wore', 'Black', 'was', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'second', 'colour', 'film', 'first', 'Fahrenhight', '451', '1966', 'strong', 'use', 'primery', 'colours', 'namly', 'red', 'blue', 'white', 'black', 'particular', 'decision', 'dress', 'Julie', 'Kohler', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'only', 'black', 'white', 'extreamely', 'effective', 'five', 'victims', 'treated', 'different', 'creation', 'black', 'white', 'sometimes', 'designed', 'lure', 'respective', 'man', 'fate', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'amazing', 'performance', 'title', 'role', 'however', 'alluring', 'victims', 'fall', 'love', 'eyes', 'are', 'always', 'filled', 'cold', 'hatred', 'them.This', 'film', 'tribute', 'master', 'suspence', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Bernard', 'Herrmann', 'music', 'slightly', 'cold', 'lighting', 'together', 'restrained', 'style', 'acting', 'combine', 'make', 'French', 'version', 'unmistakeable', 'cocktail', 'as', 'deadly', 'poisoned', 'Arrack', 'Julie', 'Bliss', 'second', 'victim', 'Bride', 'Wore', 'Black', 'lot', 'better', 'films', 'Hitchcock', 'was', 'comming', 'out', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'namely', 'quot', 'Torn', 'Curtain', 'quot', '1967', 'quot', 'Topaz', 'quot', '1969', 'DVD', 'not', 'appear', 'have', 'been', 'digitally', 'restored', 'original', 'print', 'been', 'made', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'be', 'distracted', 'subtitles', 'have', 'option', 'view', 'film', 'dubbed', 'English', 'language', 'soundtrack', 'American', 'accents', 'sound', 'bit', 'strange', 'eminating', 'thoes', 'French', 'modern', 'audiences', 'may', 'apear', 'bit', 'camp', 'quot', 'must', 'have', 'quot', 'lover', 'French', 'New', 'Wave', 'Cinema']",N/A

Even in prison, she manages to kill.  Her impassive demeanor is a perfect representation of the Woolrich ethos--that life in its unpredictability will change you so dramatically that there is no chance in hell you will ever be the same as you were before.The killers are all regular guys who never suspect a thing--because they're not professional criminals, they have no reason to be looking over their shoulders.  The various methods the Moreau character uses to dispatch the men are clever and intriguing.Truffaut's sharp eye for character detail is an exact match with Woolrich's mordant eye for plotting.

146841,A182CY2NWMR6XT,0792841433,"Miguel ""Writer, Journalist, Film Critic""","[4, 5]","Francois Truffaut's THE BRIDE WORE BLACK is an excellent gift of a film to fans of Hitchcock and even to the master himself. There are many nods to Hitch's films and you know Truffaut had done his homework while making the picture (by writing the definitive book on Hitch's films). What makes BRIDE WORE BLACK more than just mere homage is an elevation of suspense and a less stylized, blatant approach to the material. Truffaut does not sell his own cinematic soul and is able to present a terrific suspense story of his own. It was almost like Hitch's work turned inside out. Jeanne Moreau plays a miserable middle-aged woman, both suicidal and murderous, looking to avenge the death of her life-long companion and husband.We see the murder of the husband repeatedly throughout the picture, studied from different angles and vantage points. He is assassinated on the steps of the church, while the thunderous 'wedding suite' plays rather ominously. We find out why she picks her victims the way she does and how they all relate to the slaying. This is one ticked off woman. Some of the murders echoed Hitch, one inspired by FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, another from NOTORIOUS. The scenes and &quot;borrowing&quot; that occur here are not as blatant as you may think, however. They are mostly inspirations and Truffaut puts his own spin on them, meshing them together or taking them apart and reassembling the elements. If you are a Hitch connoisseur, it is fun to interpret what Truffaut is doing with the master's vast material.I was also struck by a feeling of NORTH BY NORTHWEST, but with a woman as the main protagonist and the journey turned inside out. Of course, we get the character who has seen this person before and either leads to her capture or is on to her, a staple in Hitch flix. The ultimate homage is Bernard Herrmann's score (he was Hitch's right hand man for years). The 'wedding suite' is louder than usual, resonating evil, and the music as a whole is Herrmann's typical gothic work, brilliant and memorable. Truffaut extends Hitchcock by showing us in more graphic detail some of the killings and the relentless mission this woman is on is not stylized the least bit.Check out the poisoning scene and tell me you don't see Ingrid Bergman looking at Claude Raines circling and bellowing in expressionistic ways. Trains are littered throughout the film, one on the lampshade of a young boy, another with Moreau riding on it. This is all great, but it transcends some of Hitch's work in many ways. The blood-curdling ending is one of the best I have ever seen in film, period. Considering BRIDE WORE BLACK was released in 1968, the horrific ending may have inspired HITCH of all people when he made FRENZY in 1972. Watch both and see if you know what I mean.

I certainly found his book of interviews with Alfred Hitchcock to be a marvelous insight to Hitchcock and his films.  As I understand it, ""The Bride wore Black"" came out the following year and is a tribute by Truffaut to Hitchcock.  It is a good movie; it is not Hitchcock, but it is a good movie.  It centers on a woman who is out to kill the five men who were responsible for killing her husband just moments after their marriage.As the movie unfolds, we gradually get more and more about the what, where, when and why for these murders.  This is a nice touch because the mystery we encounter deals with the present as well as the past.  The ""bride"" is a hard person to figure out.  She plays an emotional-less role very well but we know that something deep within is really motivating her.  I realized that it was the death of her husband but even that didn't explain the depth of her compusion.  I was thinking about this after I watched the movie and then I recalled a minor little scene in the film that suddenly illuminated everything.  It was a visual recollection of her relationship with her brief spouse.  In the recollection they were bosom buddies since they were 5 or 6 years old.  This wasn't just a tentative ""I Do"" relationship, this really was a one in a million, life-long before it even began, true love relationship.  In the briefest of scenes was the key to understanding everything.  It may not have been classic Hitchcock but it was the best of Truffaut.  The rest of the film falls together nicely and wraps up in a most delightful many (as I suspect Hitchcock might say).

146844,AGSWTH7SP2256,0792841433,R. W. Rasband,"[20, 21]","""The Bride Wore Black"" is another neo-noir classic from Francois Truffaut.  It's adapted from the pulp novel masterpiece by Cornell Woolrich (aka William Irish.)  Truffaut retains the story and the sense of doom of the book but pares down Woolrich's convoluted plot so that it is even darker.  Jeanne Moreau is scary as the implacable Bride, who tracks down the five men she holds responsible for the death of her husband on their wedding day.  (You can see the tremendous influence this film had on Tarantino'sKill Bill, Volume 1).  This is an icy examination of the eternal war between men and women;  the men are either sexual predators or spinless wimps, and the Bride is remorseless in exterminating them.  The film has several setpieces that are obviously tributes to Hitchcock (like the high-rise building; and the wrongfully accused teacher.)  There's even a musical score by Hitch's signature composer, Bernard Herrman.  Truffaut ratchets up the tension to unbearable levels as we wait to see how the Bride will dispatch her next victim.  Truffaut, the great humanist and friend of small children, occasionally peeks out, but mostly this film is  a gripping ride on the dark side.  It also has one of the gratest final scenes I've encountered in a movie.

Based on Cornell Woolrich's classic novel, this is Truffaut's homage to an even more legendary director, Alfred Hitchcock.  Jeanne Moreau plays a young woman who seeks revenge on the five men responsible for her husband's death as they leave the church on their wedding day.Moreau is quite chilling (and quite sexy) as the obsessed woman bent on avenging her husband's death.  The actors who play four of the five men are okay but rather bland.  The one exception is Charles Denner who is quite good as the artist who becomes one of her victims.The story is rather far-fetched, but then most of Woolrich's novels are.  For that matter, the entire noir world never makes much sense.  The suspense is genuine as one by one the avenging angel stalks her prey.  The ending is quite surprising as the woman finally encounters the last of the five men in a highly unlikely place.",4,Homage to Hitchcock,1315526400,"09 9, 2011",2011,939,"['Taut', 'noirish', 'thriller', 'legendary', 'director', 'Francois', 'Truffaut', 'Based', 'Cornell', 'Woolrich', 'classic', 'novel', 'Truffaut', 'homage', 'even', 'more', 'legendary', 'director', 'Alfred', 'Hitchcock', 'Jeanne', 'Moreau', 'young', 'woman', 'who', 'revenge', 'five', 'men', 'responsible', 'husband', 'death', 'leave', 'church', 'wedding', 'day.Moreau', 'quite', 'chilling', 'quite', 'sexy', 'obsessed', 'woman', 'bent', 'avenging', 'husband', 'death', 'actors', 'who', 'play', 'four', 'five', 'men', 'are', 'okay', 'rather', 'bland', 'one', 'exception', 'Charles', 'Denner', 'who', 'quite', 'good', 'artist', 'who', 'one', 'victims.The', 'story', 'rather', 'far-fetched', 'then', 'most', 'Woolrich', 'novels', 'are', 'matter', 'entire', 'noir', 'world', 'never', 'much', 'sense', 'suspense', 'genuine', 'one', 'one', 'avenging', 'angel', 'prey', 'ending', 'quite', 'surprising', 'woman', 'finally', 'last', 'five', 'men', 'highly', 'unlikely', 'place']",N/A
