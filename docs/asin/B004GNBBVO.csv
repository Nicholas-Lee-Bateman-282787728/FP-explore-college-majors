Steiner ""Huskarl1066""","[7, 21]","I do not think I got 1/2 way through this piece of Soviet Propaganda crap before I turned it off; it is actually unbearble.  The film begins, as a previous review states, in an idyllic Soviet Wonderland, where people eat icecreame, fish, watch movies, and make love.  Then, enter the EVIL Nazis!!!  Let the raping, murder and brutality begin.  I stuck this film in right after I finished watching Katyn.  I was hoping for a realistic, objective treatment of this opening battle for Army Group Centre.  That was not the case.  If you want to find out what really happended, read Paul Carrels' ""Hitler moves East"".  If you want to watch a really good Russian war film, buy the 9th Company.  One last word..this movie was dedicated to the ""Heros"" of Brest-Litovsk who died in the defense of the ""Motherland"". Brest was POLISH territory, which was absorbed into the Soviet Union by conquest, after the Russian invasion of Poland on 18 September, 1939.  The Russians took land streching from Smolensk to Brest, which was the demarkation line between them and the Germans once the campaign ended.",1,This movie sux!,1352678400,"11 12, 2012",2012,1090,"['do', 'not', 'think', 'got', '1/2', 'way', 'piece', 'Soviet', 'Propaganda', 'crap', 'turned', 'off', 'actually', 'unbearble', 'film', 'previous', 'review', 'states', 'idyllic', 'Soviet', 'Wonderland', 'where', 'people', 'eat', 'icecreame', 'fish', 'watch', 'movies', 'make', 'love', 'Then', 'enter', 'EVIL', 'Nazis', 'Let', 'raping', 'murder', 'brutality', 'begin', 'stuck', 'film', 'right', 'finished', 'watching', 'Katyn', 'was', 'hoping', 'realistic', 'objective', 'treatment', 'opening', 'battle', 'Army', 'Group', 'Centre', 'was', 'not', 'case', 'want', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'really', 'happended', 'read', 'Paul', 'Carrels', 'Hitler', 'East', 'want', 'watch', 'really', 'good', 'Russian', 'war', 'film', 'buy', '9th', 'Company', 'One', 'last', 'word..this', 'movie', 'was', 'dedicated', 'Heros', 'Brest-Litovsk', 'who', 'died', 'defense', 'Motherland', 'Brest', 'was', 'POLISH', 'territory', 'was', 'absorbed', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'conquest', 'Russian', 'invasion', 'Poland', '18', 'September', '1939', 'Russians', 'took', 'land', 'streching', 'Smolensk', 'Brest', 'was', 'demarkation', 'line', 'Germans', 'once', 'campaign', 'ended']",N/A

1407036,A51MI6RY4NTRX,B004GNBBVO,"Bernardo G. Cavaliere ""Tenente Bernardo""","[1, 2]","A big budget Russian ww2 war movie. Great action sequences, and fine acting. Overall script and sequences well done. Basically a historical drama based on an actual defense of a Red Army fortress trapped behind German lines at the outset of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the USSR. The problem I have with this movie is the beginning and end ... at the beginning we have this idylic set of scenes of life in the fortress, all is peace and plenty with giggling sweathearts, kids playing, a band playing a concert, a communist utopia with no fear of the gulags, no denunciations, no poverty, no disease ... the whole thing is like a quaint town gala in 19th century midwest USA or the opening scenes of The North Star, that dopey US propaganda movie about our 'courageous soviet allies'. blah blah blah. It is completely out of joint with the realities of the era in the USSR under Stalin. At the end of the film after the fortress is taken by the Wehrmacht, the young boy who escapes thinks wistfully back in time, now an old war veteran many years later and believes all those of the Red Army who died at the fort are somewhere still alive... but how ? Isn't he thinking of an afterlife for them? a HEAVEN ? But wait, I thought communism was ATHEIST !!! they are therefore just DEAD !!! Oh well, who said Russian cinema was logical or truthful ! LOL ! but as movies go, it was very ENTERTAINING. Also, the Germans are once again depicted as keystone cops, falling down and behaving like their tactics are crap, which of course is nonsense, at this stage they were kicking red army ASS, esp since they do take the fort in the end, despite the heroics of the red army...If you like to watch military fighting, good pyrotechnics and uniforms, good acting and good CGI, and historical drama roughly based on actual historical events, this one's a good romp. Just don't expect a documentary on the realities of life in Stalin's CCCP or the red army of that era. But the Russki's sure know how to blow stuff up on screen !

It was like watching a 30 year old movie when it came to storyline and sometimes background music. A the same time sets and charactersation was most interesting.Fortress of War come out as a fully mature film and everything comes brilliantly together. The movie is full of characters in strong emotional situations, usually slightly undertoned giving the imagination free rein. The battle scenes are brutal and well made with even clever twist thrown in here and there. The film is about resistance and heroism in the face of danger.Historically it is very interesting, as Defense of Brest Fortress is important to the Russian and White Russian character. True to life the Brest (Brest in White Russia not France) Fortress was hit by full force when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. Quickly surrounded the Germans had to fight to capture it 2 years before during the invasion of Poland and attempted to capture it this time by a Coup de main (A coup de main is a swift attack that relies on speed and surprise to accomplish its objectives in a single blow.) This failed and turned into a costly struggle.

Very well acted, the movie shows how the soldiers of the Russian battalion stationed at Brest attempted to stand over the German siege over several days. Drama is added as the fortress was home of wives and children of these soldiers, and by the fact that is told in first person by one of only survivors, a young military boy. The movie has very well achieved street battle scenes. Good attention is placed to details of Russian and German uniforms, as well as to fighter and bomber planes. Overall, a very good addition to war or war drama movie fans.It seems to me that a few reviewers are a bit bothered and view this movie as a bit of communist propaganda. I strongly disagree to it. The movie clearly is centered on a historical episode that took place while the Soviet Union was a communist country, so what's the problem with that. In addition, Russians lost this battle, and Germans are depicted simply as an invading military force, without any evident political connotation.My DVD copy is a release by G2 Pictures that comes with a Russian audio and English subtitles.

1407047,AYKN84MIK63TP,B004GNBBVO,M. Hughes,"[6, 6]","This is a good movie, by any standard. If you are interested in this subject or interested in getting something from the Russian point of view then you will like this movie. I have read some rather silly and uninformed reviews of this movie - some of which gave positive star ratings, but then slag it off as propaganda, etc.  I'll give these people the benefit of the doubt that they are not as familiar as I am with Soviet history, the Great Patriotic War or Russian culture in general, but this film can hardly be characterized as ""communist"" propaganda. Since this film is based on real events and real people each of the central characters are given a bit of an obit towards the end by the makers of the film. They do not fail to mention the repression suffered by one officer posthumously awarded the ""Hero of the Soviet Union"". As well they note the fact that the others received the award - not at the time, but many, many years later - post Stalin. For an American viewer that might not mean much, but to a Russian it speaks volumes. The heroism of these men in defending their fort, families and country being recognized with the order of ""Hero of the Soviet Union"" after Stalin's death is as good as saying ""Stalin"" and the Soviets threw these guys under the bus and failed to recognize them - we are making up for it now. Russians are not real show boaters or braggarts. They tend to be inscrutably subtle. That can be a little tough for some Americans to pick up on right away. Others criticized the happy scenes that opened the film - as if such happy scenes never existed in the Soviet Union, but again, if you know anything about the War or the culture at the time, you would understand that the film opens on the longest day of the year and the start of summer. It is traditionally a big family day, a picnic and party in the park kind of day - not only then in the Soviet Union, but even now in Russia. Those scenes ring absolutely true and having read many first person accounts and having spoken to many pensioners and veterans who were alive at the time - none of whom were commissars or apparatchiks - they all described similar scenes on that fateful day in their own lives. It was the day the war started. Others take the opportunity to use their review seemingly not to address the movie and the story itself, but as an occasion to review the sum total of the Soviet experience. Folks, it is movie about a group of soldiers overrun and surrounded on the first day of the war, coping with all the shock and unimaginable horrors that was the war in the East. It is not a treatise on the benefits and glories of the Soviet Union - and it doesn't come across that way either. Some people can't get off their soapbox for even two hours. The people who were trapped there and ultimately died there - sorry, there is no ""Saving Private Ryan"" ending - were heroes. In that moment, in those circumstances and context, in that small corner of that gigantic front and war - far, far away from the halls of power in Berlin or Moscow, London or Washington - be they a communist or simple soldier, a civilian or a child - they were the ones facing head on the horror of the Nazis, not some armchair wannabe general leaving his review here - and they died heroes. It is a powerful, powerful movie. Generally great performances throughout. Very human portrayals and not unidimensional characters. A normal person will be moved to tears by the close of the film. And it is a worthy and no doubt overdue testament to those people who died in those first terrible days of the war in the East.",5,4.5 Stars - Really Strong & Well Done,1358726400,"01 21, 2013",2013,3598,"['good', 'movie', 'standard', 'are', 'interested', 'subject', 'interested', 'getting', 'something', 'Russian', 'point', 'view', 'then', 'will', 'like', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'rather', 'silly', 'uninformed', 'reviews', 'movie', 'gave', 'positive', 'star', 'ratings', 'then', 'slag', 'off', 'propaganda', 'etc', ""'ll"", 'give', 'people', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'are', 'not', 'as', 'familiar', 'am', 'Soviet', 'history', 'Great', 'Patriotic', 'War', 'Russian', 'culture', 'general', 'film', 'can', 'hardly', 'be', 'characterized', 'communist', 'propaganda', 'film', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'real', 'people', 'central', 'characters', 'are', 'given', 'bit', 'obit', 'end', 'makers', 'film', 'do', 'not', 'fail', 'mention', 'repression', 'suffered', 'one', 'officer', 'posthumously', 'awarded', 'Hero', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'well', 'note', 'fact', 'others', 'received', 'award', 'not', 'time', 'many', 'many', 'years', 'later', 'post', 'Stalin', 'American', 'viewer', 'might', 'not', 'mean', 'much', 'Russian', 'volumes', 'heroism', 'men', 'defending', 'fort', 'families', 'country', 'being', 'recognized', 'order', 'Hero', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Stalin', 'death', 'as', 'good', 'saying', 'Stalin', 'Soviets', 'threw', 'guys', 'bus', 'failed', 'recognize', 'are', 'making', 'up', 'now', 'Russians', 'are', 'not', 'real', 'show', 'boaters', 'braggarts', 'tend', 'be', 'inscrutably', 'subtle', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'tough', 'Americans', 'pick', 'up', 'right', 'away', 'Others', 'criticized', 'happy', 'scenes', 'opened', 'film', 'such', 'happy', 'scenes', 'never', 'existed', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'again', 'know', 'anything', 'War', 'culture', 'time', 'would', 'understand', 'film', 'longest', 'day', 'year', 'start', 'summer', 'traditionally', 'big', 'family', 'day', 'picnic', 'party', 'park', 'kind', 'day', 'not', 'only', 'then', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'even', 'now', 'Russia', 'scenes', 'ring', 'absolutely', 'true', 'having', 'read', 'many', 'first', 'person', 'accounts', 'having', 'spoken', 'many', 'pensioners', 'veterans', 'who', 'were', 'alive', 'time', 'none', 'whom', 'were', 'commissars', 'apparatchiks', 'described', 'similar', 'scenes', 'fateful', 'day', 'own', 'lives', 'was', 'day', 'war', 'started', 'Others', 'take', 'opportunity', 'use', 'review', 'seemingly', 'not', 'address', 'movie', 'story', 'occasion', 'review', 'sum', 'total', 'Soviet', 'experience', 'Folks', 'movie', 'group', 'soldiers', 'overrun', 'surrounded', 'first', 'day', 'war', 'coping', 'shock', 'unimaginable', 'horrors', 'was', 'war', 'East', 'not', 'treatise', 'benefits', 'glories', 'Soviet', 'Union', ""n't"", 'come', 'way', 'people', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'off', 'soapbox', 'even', 'two', 'hours', 'people', 'who', 'were', 'trapped', 'there', 'ultimately', 'died', 'sorry', 'Saving', 'Private', 'Ryan', 'ending', 'were', 'heroes', 'moment', 'circumstances', 'context', 'small', 'corner', 'gigantic', 'front', 'war', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'halls', 'power', 'Berlin', 'Moscow', 'London', 'Washington', 'be', 'communist', 'simple', 'soldier', 'civilian', 'child', 'were', 'ones', 'facing', 'head', 'horror', 'Nazis', 'not', 'armchair', 'general', 'leaving', 'review', 'here', 'died', 'heroes', 'powerful', 'powerful', 'movie', 'Generally', 'great', 'performances', 'Very', 'human', 'portrayals', 'not', 'unidimensional', 'characters', 'normal', 'person', 'will', 'be', 'moved', 'tears', 'close', 'film', 'worthy', 'doubt', 'overdue', 'testament', 'people', 'who', 'died', 'first', 'terrible', 'days', 'war', 'East']",N/A

The story is told through the perspective of a young Russian boy who was inside the famed Brest fortress and witnessed the fighting and siege first-hand, so the story is surprisingly accurate with far less Russian bravado than one generally gets in a Russian WWII movie.The cinematography is superb, the early war Russian uniforms are spot-on perfect, and they did a great job of recreating some very authentic-looking Panzer III tanks for this film.  The acting is all extremely good, there's nothing that strikes you as &#34;silly&#34; or overly patriotic (very rare in Russian-made WWII movies) and most of the characters portrayed in the movie (from what I can tell) were actual Russian officers and soldiers who were at Brest in 1941.If I had to point at a single Russian WWII movie as the best film yet, honestly, it would have to be this one - it really is that good.  Cannot recommend this one highly enough, it is a seriously great piece of work and there's absolutely nothing here I can find to be critical of - and that's rare!",5,GREAT Russian war movie - a true epic and not to be missed if you are a WWII history buff.,1390348800,"01 22, 2014",2014,1237,"['last', 'half', 'dozen', 'years', ""'ve"", 'started', 'watching', 'more', 'Russian-made', 'WWII', 'movies', 'must', 'say', 'THIS', 'movie', 'now', 'officially', 'best', 'single', 'effort', ""'ve"", 'come', 'outstanding', 'film', 'story', 'told', 'perspective', 'young', 'Russian', 'boy', 'who', 'was', 'famed', 'Brest', 'fortress', 'witnessed', 'fighting', 'siege', 'first-hand', 'story', 'surprisingly', 'accurate', 'far', 'less', 'Russian', 'bravado', 'one', 'generally', 'Russian', 'WWII', 'movie.The', 'cinematography', 'superb', 'early', 'war', 'Russian', 'uniforms', 'are', 'spot-on', 'perfect', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'recreating', 'very', 'authentic-looking', 'Panzer', 'III', 'tanks', 'film', 'acting', 'extremely', 'good', 'nothing', '34', 'silly', '34', 'overly', 'patriotic', 'very', 'rare', 'Russian-made', 'WWII', 'movies', 'most', 'characters', 'portrayed', 'movie', 'what', 'can', 'tell', 'were', 'actual', 'Russian', 'officers', 'soldiers', 'who', 'were', 'Brest', '1941.If', 'had', 'point', 'single', 'Russian', 'WWII', 'movie', 'best', 'film', 'yet', 'honestly', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'one', 'really', 'good', 'Can', 'not', 'recommend', 'one', 'highly', 'enough', 'seriously', 'great', 'piece', 'work', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'here', 'can', 'find', 'be', 'critical', 'rare']",N/A

1407050,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,B004GNBBVO,The Mysterious Traveler,"[54, 66]","THE BREST FORTRESS (2010) Directed by Alexander Kott. Starring lots of Russians.The true story, told through the eyes of a young boy, of a group of Red Army soldiers who hold out for six days against the Wehrmacht during the June, 1941 invasion of Russia in the ancient fortress of Brest in Belorussia.The film is extremely well done and acted and the only Russian film in this viewer's pretty extensive experience covering the early days of Operation Barbarossa. Usually the Russians have shied away from this period of the War and the only films out there concerning it have been in either Finnish or English. The direction and photography are very well done. The cgi is pretty good. Some of the acting is very good.  The film plays very much like.......and actually lifts a scene or two from the American films WAKE ISLAND and BATAAN.What makes the film extremely interesting........and more than a little disturbing on multiple levels is how retrograde it is regarding the Soviet Union.  Before the Germans invade and similar to the American film THE NORTH STAR, Communist Russia is portrayed as literally some paradise where the sun always shines and smiling comrades dance and sing. The commissar---who in real life probably sent hundreds to torture and death---is heroic and a tower of strength. The NKVD man assigned to watch over the soldiers is a harmless happy jolly fat man who clicks his heels in the air as he walks.  There is absolutely NO MENTION that the reason that the Red Army is in the fortress in the first place is because in 1939, THEY INVADED Poland and took Brest from the Poles. The portrayal of the Germans is vintage WW2 era. There is not a good one in the batch. They rape women, machine gun civilians, run over children with tanks etc etc etc. I kept expecting Erich Von Stroheim and Martin Kosleck to march in. Of course the Germans are simply behaving much like these smiling happy Red Army soldiers did to the Poles  three years previous but hush.It is as if the Wall never fell. The film could easily been made some thirty or forty years ago.  If the film is to be taken on face value, there is apparently a growing nostalgia in Russia for the days of Good old Uncle Joe and the Communist Party.It is also rather sad that Russia can make a patriotic war film heralding its soldiers in 2010 but a similar film could never EVER be made in the United States today.  Something very wrong there.Probably the best WW2 film since THE GREAT RAID and recommended.",4,Ah the Glory days of the Communist Paradise before the National Socialists came...,1305936000,"05 21, 2011",2011,2489,"['BREST', 'FORTRESS', '2010', 'Directed', 'Alexander', 'Kott', 'Starring', 'lots', 'Russians.The', 'true', 'story', 'told', 'eyes', 'young', 'boy', 'group', 'Red', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'who', 'hold', 'out', 'six', 'days', 'Wehrmacht', 'June', '1941', 'invasion', 'Russia', 'ancient', 'fortress', 'Brest', 'Belorussia.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'acted', 'only', 'Russian', 'film', 'viewer', 'pretty', 'extensive', 'experience', 'covering', 'early', 'days', 'Operation', 'Barbarossa', 'Usually', 'Russians', 'have', 'shied', 'away', 'period', 'War', 'only', 'films', 'there', 'concerning', 'have', 'been', 'Finnish', 'English', 'direction', 'photography', 'are', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'cgi', 'pretty', 'good', 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'very', 'much', '.and', 'actually', 'scene', 'two', 'American', 'films', 'WAKE', 'ISLAND', 'BATAAN.What', 'film', 'extremely', 'interesting', 'more', 'little', 'disturbing', 'multiple', 'levels', 'how', 'retrograde', 'regarding', 'Soviet', 'Union', 'Germans', 'invade', 'similar', 'American', 'film', 'THE', 'NORTH', 'STAR', 'Communist', 'Russia', 'portrayed', 'literally', 'paradise', 'where', 'sun', 'always', 'shines', 'smiling', 'comrades', 'dance', 'sing', 'commissar', '-who', 'real', 'life', 'probably', 'sent', 'hundreds', 'torture', 'death', 'heroic', 'tower', 'strength', 'NKVD', 'man', 'assigned', 'watch', 'soldiers', 'harmless', 'happy', 'jolly', 'fat', 'man', 'who', 'heels', 'air', 'absolutely', 'MENTION', 'reason', 'Red', 'Army', 'fortress', 'first', 'place', '1939', 'THEY', 'INVADED', 'Poland', 'took', 'Brest', 'Poles', 'portrayal', 'Germans', 'vintage', 'WW2', 'era', 'not', 'good', 'one', 'batch', 'rape', 'women', 'machine', 'gun', 'civilians', 'run', 'children', 'tanks', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'kept', 'expecting', 'Erich', 'Von', 'Stroheim', 'Martin', 'Kosleck', 'march', 'course', 'Germans', 'are', 'simply', 'behaving', 'much', 'smiling', 'happy', 'Red', 'Army', 'soldiers', 'did', 'Poles', 'three', 'years', 'previous', 'hush.It', 'Wall', 'never', 'fell', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'been', 'made', 'thirty', 'forty', 'years', 'ago', 'film', 'be', 'taken', 'face', 'value', 'apparently', 'growing', 'nostalgia', 'Russia', 'days', 'Good', 'old', 'Uncle', 'Joe', 'Communist', 'Party.It', 'also', 'rather', 'sad', 'Russia', 'can', 'make', 'patriotic', 'war', 'film', 'heralding', 'soldiers', '2010', 'similar', 'film', 'could', 'never', 'EVER', 'be', 'made', 'United', 'States', 'today', 'Something', 'very', 'wrong', 'there.Probably', 'best', 'WW2', 'film', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'RAID', 'recommended']",N/A
1407051,A29XKBB6SEYTN6,B004GNBBVO,Tommy Dooley,"[5, 6]","This Russian gem of a film starts with a young boy and how he plays for the Red Army marching band. He tells the story through the lives of those that lived and died through out the siege. It is set on June 22 1941 and the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Russians' under Comrade Stalin guidance had signed the Molotov Ribbentrov pact of non aggression. They had no orders to defend their borders, in fact the previous day; Russia had delivered vital war materials to the German regime.Then they attacked with out warning and without a formal declaration of war. The Russians were neutered. The Brest Fortress was not really a fortress but an 18th Century fortress/garrison that had long since become obsolete. The men had their families stationed with them, kit was a sprawling Victorian base of operations that could never with stand a modern barrage, let alone the might of the Wermacht.Once the attack begins the Russians are in disarray, but soon thanks to the Commissars, they get organised, but they have very few weapons and little ammunition. The Germans had already infiltrated their lines and cut off both power and water. They have no choice but to fight. Any attempt at a break out id met with German aggression. Once they start defending the Motherland they use everything, from chairs to barrels. This is a real war film, where hand to hand fighting is shown up close and personal.It does not shrink from any of the realities of war and does not glorify anything - except for the human spirit. The cinematography is excellent; the acting is superb, especially from the younger members of the cast. Whilst they scavenge the German weapons and try anything to defend themselves they realise they are already out flanked. They are without food, without water and without hope - but they fight on.This is truly an excellent film, I was constantly reminded of `Come and See', and it is that good. Russia continues to surprise, and Hollywood could learn a thing or two from this production. It has emotion, violence, drama and heart by the bucket load. This is one for all fans of war films, even the music is excellent - I can not recommend this highly enough, and it is one to buy- not rent as you will want to see it again, after you have got over your first viewing that is - ruddy brilliant!",5,This is what a War Film should be about,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,2311,"['Russian', 'gem', 'film', 'young', 'boy', 'how', 'Red', 'Army', 'marching', 'band', 'story', 'lives', 'lived', 'died', 'siege', 'set', 'June', '22', '1941', 'beginning', 'Operation', 'Barbarossa', 'Russians', 'Comrade', 'Stalin', 'guidance', 'had', 'signed', 'Molotov', 'Ribbentrov', 'pact', 'non', 'aggression', 'had', 'orders', 'defend', 'borders', 'fact', 'previous', 'day', 'Russia', 'had', 'delivered', 'vital', 'war', 'materials', 'German', 'regime.Then', 'attacked', 'out', 'warning', 'formal', 'declaration', 'war', 'Russians', 'were', 'neutered', 'Brest', 'Fortress', 'was', 'not', 'really', 'fortress', '18th', 'Century', 'fortress/garrison', 'had', 'long', 'become', 'obsolete', 'men', 'had', 'families', 'stationed', 'kit', 'was', 'sprawling', 'Victorian', 'base', 'operations', 'could', 'never', 'stand', 'modern', 'barrage', 'let', 'alone', 'might', 'Wermacht.Once', 'attack', 'Russians', 'are', 'disarray', 'soon', 'thanks', 'Commissars', 'get', 'organised', 'have', 'very', 'few', 'weapons', 'little', 'ammunition', 'Germans', 'had', 'already', 'infiltrated', 'lines', 'cut', 'off', 'power', 'water', 'have', 'choice', 'fight', 'attempt', 'break', 'out', 'id', 'met', 'German', 'aggression', 'start', 'defending', 'Motherland', 'use', 'everything', 'chairs', 'barrels', 'real', 'war', 'film', 'where', 'hand', 'hand', 'fighting', 'shown', 'up', 'close', 'personal.It', 'not', 'shrink', 'realities', 'war', 'not', 'glorify', 'anything', 'human', 'spirit', 'cinematography', 'excellent', 'acting', 'superb', 'especially', 'younger', 'members', 'cast', 'Whilst', 'scavenge', 'German', 'weapons', 'try', 'anything', 'defend', 'realise', 'are', 'already', 'flanked', 'are', 'food', 'water', 'hope', 'fight', 'on.This', 'truly', 'excellent', 'film', 'was', 'constantly', 'reminded', 'Come', 'See', 'good', 'Russia', 'surprise', 'Hollywood', 'could', 'learn', 'thing', 'two', 'production', 'emotion', 'violence', 'drama', 'heart', 'bucket', 'load', 'one', 'fans', 'war', 'films', 'even', 'music', 'excellent', 'can', 'not', 'recommend', 'highly', 'enough', 'one', 'buy-', 'not', 'rent', 'will', 'want', 'see', 'again', 'have', 'got', 'first', 'viewing', 'ruddy', 'brilliant']",N/A
