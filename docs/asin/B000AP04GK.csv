930430,A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL,B000AP04GK,"&#34;Rocky Raccoon&#34; ""Hey, Doc, It's Only ...","[4, 4]","""Millions"" is a stylish and heart-warming family film.  It centers around Damian (Alex Etel), a boy who is suffering from the loss of his mother.  He is living in a new setting, a middle-class suburb in England, with his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbin) and Ronnie, his father (James Nesbitt).  One day a piece of luggage filled with money hits his homemade fortress nestled close to the railroad.  Of course he and his brother are astonished, but Damian, who has a great devotion to saints, has a different vision of using the money than his practical (and more selfish) brother.  Wonderfully, the saints actually do visit him, and it is St. Francis who encourages him to give the money to the poor. However, keeping the loot a secret may be a miracle in itself. Both boys have funny ways of hiding and using the money. Damien sets out to find the poor and gives the money away whenever he can; Anthony shops for novelty items on the Internet.  Although, as might be expected, complications set in for them:  Damian tells a strange man (Christopher Fulford) that he has lots of money, an innocent mistake which makes the thief stalk after the boys and the loot.  Damian also finds out that the money was stolen, which provides a moral dilemma for him. (He thought it had fallen from heaven.) Creating even more suspense is an impending deadline:  The British pounds are soon converting to Euros, so the family must convert the money in modest sums at a number of different bank branches.The plot and atmosphere of the movie are worth the price of admission.  It is sometimes edited like a stylish video with ethereal music and painting-like colors that surely must have been embellished for the screen.  Perhaps the best aspect of ""Millions"" is Damien himself.  He is infatuated with the saints, but he is so genuinely good that the saints presented pale in comparison to him.  As apparitions, the saints presented are the least realistic portions of the film.  (For example, St. Clare smoking and St. Peter cussing aren't cute, funny, or theologically accurate portraits of saints.  And, it should be noted, that if St. Peter did appear, he would give a young boy advice, not just shrug and tell him it is a ""free will"" decision, like he should decide on his own.  Giving good advice doesn't take away free will--even from a young boy.)  Later, Damian's mother appears as a reassuring presence, and she says that he is the miracle she had performed in life.  Much like the French film, ""Ponette,"" her appearance gives us all a reason to believe.  ""Millions"" is a genuinely funny, heart-warming, and edgily suspenseful film.  As entertainment, ""Millions"" makes the viewer feel like, well,...a million.",4,Rich Family Film,1145923200,"04 25, 2006",2006,2709,"['Millions', 'stylish', 'heart-warming', 'family', 'film', 'Damian', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'boy', 'who', 'suffering', 'loss', 'mother', 'living', 'new', 'setting', 'middle-class', 'suburb', 'England', 'older', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Lewis', 'McGibbin', 'Ronnie', 'father', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'One', 'day', 'piece', 'luggage', 'filled', 'money', 'hits', 'homemade', 'fortress', 'nestled', 'close', 'railroad', 'course', 'brother', 'are', 'astonished', 'Damian', 'who', 'great', 'devotion', 'saints', 'different', 'vision', 'using', 'money', 'practical', 'more', 'selfish', 'brother', 'Wonderfully', 'saints', 'actually', 'do', 'visit', 'St.', 'Francis', 'who', 'give', 'money', 'poor', 'However', 'keeping', 'loot', 'secret', 'may', 'be', 'miracle', 'boys', 'have', 'funny', 'ways', 'hiding', 'using', 'money', 'Damien', 'out', 'find', 'poor', 'money', 'away', 'can', 'Anthony', 'shops', 'novelty', 'items', 'Internet', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'complications', 'set', 'Damian', 'strange', 'man', 'Christopher', 'Fulford', 'lots', 'money', 'innocent', 'mistake', 'thief', 'stalk', 'boys', 'loot', 'Damian', 'also', 'out', 'money', 'was', 'stolen', 'moral', 'dilemma', 'thought', 'had', 'fallen', 'heaven', 'Creating', 'even', 'more', 'suspense', 'impending', 'deadline', 'British', 'pounds', 'are', 'soon', 'converting', 'Euros', 'family', 'must', 'convert', 'money', 'modest', 'sums', 'number', 'different', 'bank', 'branches.The', 'plot', 'atmosphere', 'movie', 'are', 'price', 'admission', 'sometimes', 'edited', 'stylish', 'video', 'ethereal', 'music', 'painting-like', 'colors', 'surely', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'embellished', 'screen', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'aspect', 'Millions', 'Damien', 'infatuated', 'saints', 'so', 'genuinely', 'good', 'saints', 'presented', 'pale', 'comparison', 'apparitions', 'saints', 'presented', 'are', 'least', 'realistic', 'portions', 'film', 'example', 'St.', 'Clare', 'smoking', 'St.', 'Peter', 'cussing', 'are', ""n't"", 'cute', 'funny', 'theologically', 'accurate', 'portraits', 'saints', 'should', 'be', 'noted', 'St.', 'Peter', 'did', 'appear', 'would', 'give', 'young', 'boy', 'advice', 'not', 'just', 'shrug', 'tell', 'free', 'will', 'decision', 'should', 'decide', 'own', 'Giving', 'good', 'advice', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'free', 'will', 'even', 'young', 'boy', 'Later', 'Damian', 'mother', 'reassuring', 'presence', 'miracle', 'had', 'performed', 'life', 'Much', 'French', 'film', 'Ponette', 'appearance', 'reason', 'believe', 'Millions', 'genuinely', 'funny', 'heart-warming', 'edgily', 'suspenseful', 'film', 'entertainment', 'Millions', 'viewer', 'feel', 'well', 'million']",N/A

The back drop of this film is a new housing development on the eve of Great Britain's conversion from the Pound to the Euro.  Young Damian, played captivatingly by Alex Etel, misses his deceased mother and is fascinated with saints and heaven.  His older brother, Anthony, played with as much charm by Lewis McGibbon, just wants to move into the family's new house and get on with life.  Damian has visions, visions of saints.  As young as he is, he seems to have memorized Butler's Lives of the Saints.  He hopes to find out if his mom is doing well in heaven.  He is fixated on the eternal, unlike his older brother.  In all this money literally falls out of the sky, during a conversation Damian is having with a cigarette smoking St. Clare of Assisi, right into Damian's cardboard playhouse.  That is where the fun and trouble begin.  Damian shows the money, almost $250,000 in Brit Pounds, to Anthony.  Damian sees it as a sign from God that he is to do good works of charity.  Anthony sees it as luck and an opportunity to buy whatever he desires.  Will faith win out over fortune?  Well, that is the journey in this film.  Millions also presents us with a fine supporting cast, James Nesbitt as Ronnie, the boy's father.  And Daisy Donovan, as Dorothy, who we are not really sure we can trust.  This is a great family film, for any time of the year, and should not be pigeon-holed as a ""Holiday"" film.

930433,A2MO0NUJ76FPG0,B000AP04GK,"A. H. Lynde ""ahlynde""","[8, 10]","If director Danny Boyle had given us no more than the incredible casting of English child actors Alex Etel, as Damian, and Lewis McGibbon as his older brother Anthony, he would have added another notch to his already impressive directorial belt (""Trainspotting"", ""28 Hours Later"", etc.).  But Boyle has gone far beyond superb casting with this mesmerizing, charming quasi-religious thriller.  Come again?  Well it is difficult to ascribe a genre to this one.  It's best to take it as a piece, knowing as little going in as possible -- the better to enjoy its endless twists.  This movie is about what happens to Damian, a young lower-middle class lad who happens to know about saints -- I mean he really knows about saints - when a 'miracle' in the form of a lot of loot from heaven literally lands on him.  Damian is 7, with eyes you won't soon forget, freckled and otherwise normal except that he is consumed with his saints, including their life dates, what they did to attain sainthood and is in the habit of regularly seeing and conversing with them. Fortunately for us, they all speak nice earthly cockney, except for St. Nicholas, who lays on some Latin (subtiltled).Etel as Damian gives quite simply the best child performance, if one could call it a performance, of any child actor I have ever seen.  But even given the exalted gifts of Etel, director Boyle gives his own bravura performance here.  Boyle constructs with the considerable help of screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce (""Hilary & Jackie""), a very hard film to pull off -- mixed with fantasy, crooks, the euro exchange rate, a dead mom, and those saints popping up every now and again, each of whose advice young Damian gives precisely the weight it deserves. And somehow it all works.Damian has a clear view of his purpose on earth, which is to help the poor. He is stricken (later explained in clever techno-thriller terms) by the bag of pounds sterling (crucial to the plot) while happily chatting with a saint, who smokes pot while describing the ""infinity of heaven.""  The event compels Damian forward in a most innocent but determined way to accomplish his purpose, resulting, among other things, in a particularly hefty pizza bill and a cascade of coverups.  Meanwhile, brother Anthony, older and thinking himself more worldly, is also gifted in financial matters (""change the pounds into dollars, Dad, you'll get a better rate and escape  the banks' attention""), and is the grounded alter ego of the spiritual Damian. The brothers' father and his new girlfriend -- you see, the boys' ""mum has died"" (a virtual free pass of sorts to all good things, and the mum herself a major surprise in the film), finally discover their sudden, sodden wealth, and their reactions are what you might expect, or might not. All kinds of ethical dilemmas arise about what to do with the ton of legal tender.  The news gets around and the immediate world, it seems, descends upon the family home.  The denouement is.....unforgettable, and heaven is again seriously involved.  Some critics have written this up as a family film, and it is.  But the attempt to bottle it up in any way is unwise.  For this is a deeply wise film.  And Damian the wisest of all.",5,A Deftly Miraculous Journey,1117497600,"05 31, 2005",2005,3215,"['director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'had', 'given', 'more', 'incredible', 'casting', 'English', 'child', 'actors', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'McGibbon', 'older', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'notch', 'already', 'impressive', 'directorial', 'belt', 'Trainspotting', '28', 'Hours', 'Later', 'etc.', 'Boyle', 'gone', 'far', 'superb', 'casting', 'mesmerizing', 'charming', 'quasi-religious', 'thriller', 'Come', 'again', 'Well', 'difficult', 'ascribe', 'genre', 'one', 'best', 'take', 'piece', 'knowing', 'little', 'going', 'possible', 'better', 'enjoy', 'endless', 'twists', 'movie', 'what', 'Damian', 'young', 'lower-middle', 'class', 'lad', 'who', 'know', 'saints', 'mean', 'really', 'saints', 'when', ""'miracle"", 'form', 'lot', 'loot', 'heaven', 'literally', 'Damian', '7', 'eyes', 'wo', ""n't"", 'soon', 'forget', 'freckled', 'otherwise', 'normal', 'consumed', 'saints', 'including', 'life', 'dates', 'what', 'did', 'attain', 'sainthood', 'habit', 'regularly', 'seeing', 'conversing', 'Fortunately', 'speak', 'nice', 'earthly', 'cockney', 'St.', 'Nicholas', 'who', 'Latin', 'subtiltled', '.Etel', 'Damian', 'quite', 'simply', 'best', 'child', 'performance', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'performance', 'child', 'actor', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'even', 'given', 'exalted', 'gifts', 'Etel', 'director', 'Boyle', 'own', 'bravura', 'performance', 'here', 'Boyle', 'considerable', 'help', 'screenwriter', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'very', 'hard', 'film', 'pull', 'off', 'mixed', 'fantasy', 'crooks', 'euro', 'exchange', 'rate', 'dead', 'mom', 'saints', 'popping', 'up', 'now', 'again', 'advice', 'young', 'Damian', 'precisely', 'weight', 'somehow', 'works.Damian', 'clear', 'view', 'purpose', 'earth', 'help', 'poor', 'stricken', 'later', 'explained', 'clever', 'techno-thriller', 'terms', 'bag', 'pounds', 'sterling', 'crucial', 'plot', 'happily', 'chatting', 'saint', 'who', 'pot', 'describing', 'infinity', 'heaven', 'event', 'compels', 'Damian', 'forward', 'most', 'innocent', 'determined', 'way', 'accomplish', 'purpose', 'resulting', 'other', 'things', 'particularly', 'hefty', 'pizza', 'bill', 'cascade', 'coverups', 'Meanwhile', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'older', 'thinking', 'more', 'worldly', 'also', 'gifted', 'financial', 'matters', 'change', 'pounds', 'dollars', 'Dad', ""'ll"", 'get', 'better', 'rate', 'escape', 'banks', 'attention', 'grounded', 'alter', 'ego', 'spiritual', 'Damian', 'brothers', 'father', 'new', 'girlfriend', 'see', 'boys', 'mum', 'died', 'virtual', 'free', 'pass', 'sorts', 'good', 'things', 'mum', 'major', 'surprise', 'film', 'finally', 'discover', 'sudden', 'sodden', 'wealth', 'reactions', 'are', 'what', 'might', 'expect', 'might', 'not', 'kinds', 'ethical', 'dilemmas', 'arise', 'what', 'do', 'ton', 'legal', 'tender', 'news', 'around', 'immediate', 'world', 'family', 'home', 'denouement', '..unforgettable', 'heaven', 'again', 'seriously', 'involved', 'critics', 'have', 'written', 'up', 'family', 'film', 'attempt', 'bottle', 'up', 'way', 'unwise', 'deeply', 'wise', 'film', 'Damian', 'wisest']",N/A

930436,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B000AP04GK,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","Danny Boyle is a director I strongly respect.  Even though I found his Oscar winning vehicle to be a bit of a sloppily clich&eacute;d mess, I still consider him one of the directing giants working in cinema today.  His films are ridiculously varied, which only goes to prove his range.  I mean, since his early years he's presented films that cover basis like addiction (`Trainspotting') to zombies ('28 Days Later') to science fiction (`Sunshine') to adventure biopics (`127 Hours') and even that one he won the Oscar for, the romantic adventure-drama set in India (`Slumdog Millionare').  The point is that none of his films are alike, except maybe some similar editing tricks.So that brings me to `Millions'.  Of all of Boyle's achievements, I think that this may be one of my favorites.  It's just so wholesome and hearty.  This is Boyle's answer to the `family film', and he conquers this genre with the same spark and energy with which he conquered the horror genre.A man of many talents is he.`Millions' tells the story of two brothers who are dealing with the loss of their mother.  The youngest, Damien, is taking it the hardest.  He is convinced that his mother is a saint in heaven and so he is striving to attain a saintly status himself.  During his quest, he happens to find a `gift from heaven'; a bag of money.  That money has dirty ties, but those ties are unknown to young Damien.  So, Damien and his brother decide to spend the money, and Damien's goal is to attain sainthood by helping the poor.  Of course, the source of the money is going to make things difficult, not to mention the fact that there is a giant economic shift taking place and Damien and his family must get the `pounds' they have in their possession switched over to `euros'.The acting is very good, but young Alex Etel steals the show in a BIG way.  His performance is beautiful to watch; so sincere and tender and heart-tugging.At the film's core is a beautiful story of love and the power of a miracle.  As Damien struggles to stay connected to his mother he discovers what being human is all about.  As his mother lets him know, her miracle was having him.  Life is the greatest miracle of all, but it's what we do with that life that really makes the difference.Get ready for the waterworks.",5,A richly rewarding family film...,1318982400,"10 19, 2011",2011,2285,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'director', 'strongly', 'respect', 'Even', 'found', 'Oscar', 'winning', 'vehicle', 'be', 'bit', 'sloppily', 'clich', 'eacute', 'mess', 'still', 'consider', 'one', 'directing', 'giants', 'working', 'cinema', 'today', 'films', 'are', 'ridiculously', 'varied', 'only', 'prove', 'range', 'mean', 'early', 'years', 'presented', 'films', 'cover', 'basis', 'addiction', 'Trainspotting', 'zombies', ""'28"", 'Days', 'Later', 'science', 'fiction', 'Sunshine', 'adventure', 'biopics', '127', 'Hours', 'even', 'one', 'won', 'Oscar', 'romantic', 'adventure-drama', 'set', 'India', 'Slumdog', 'Millionare', 'point', 'none', 'films', 'are', 'alike', 'maybe', 'similar', 'editing', 'tricks.So', 'Millions', 'Boyle', 'achievements', 'think', 'may', 'be', 'one', 'favorites', 'just', 'so', 'wholesome', 'hearty', 'Boyle', 'answer', 'family', 'film', 'genre', 'same', 'spark', 'energy', 'conquered', 'horror', 'genre.A', 'man', 'many', 'talents', 'he.', 'Millions', 'story', 'two', 'brothers', 'who', 'are', 'dealing', 'loss', 'mother', 'youngest', 'Damien', 'taking', 'hardest', 'convinced', 'mother', 'saint', 'heaven', 'so', 'striving', 'attain', 'saintly', 'status', 'quest', 'find', 'gift', 'heaven', 'bag', 'money', 'money', 'dirty', 'ties', 'ties', 'are', 'unknown', 'young', 'Damien', 'So', 'Damien', 'brother', 'decide', 'spend', 'money', 'Damien', 'goal', 'attain', 'sainthood', 'helping', 'poor', 'course', 'source', 'money', 'going', 'make', 'things', 'difficult', 'not', 'mention', 'fact', 'giant', 'economic', 'shift', 'taking', 'place', 'Damien', 'family', 'must', 'get', 'pounds', 'have', 'possession', 'switched', ""euros'.The"", 'acting', 'very', 'good', 'young', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'show', 'BIG', 'way', 'performance', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'sincere', 'tender', 'heart-tugging.At', 'film', 'core', 'beautiful', 'story', 'love', 'power', 'miracle', 'Damien', 'stay', 'connected', 'mother', 'what', 'being', 'human', 'about', 'mother', 'know', 'miracle', 'was', 'having', 'Life', 'greatest', 'miracle', 'what', 'do', 'life', 'really', 'difference.Get', 'ready', 'waterworks']",N/A

930441,AR37967IAR6ZT,B000AP04GK,Benjamin,"[7, 10]","Damian Cunningham's faith in God and the saints is so strong that he can see them. They accompany the young boy through his days in his family's new neighborhood; they're with him in his clubhouse. They help him with his troubles. And they answer all of his questions - except one.Damian wonders if they've heard of a ""Saint Maureen,"" telling them she's new and probably the saint of quality facial care, and they can't give him any information about her.Maureen is Damian's mom, who just died, and Damian and his dad and brother Anthony aren't sure how to go on without her. The move to the new neighborhood was a way to escape daily reminders of the woman, but it's not enough.One day, while Damian's in his cardboard-box clubhouse next to the railroad tracks, a bag filled with thousands of British pounds falls from the sky, and Damian thinks it's a gift from God.Confiding in Anthony, who's two years older and a whiz with money, Damian tries to figure out what to do with the money, which will become worthless once Britain converts to the Euro in a couple days. Anthony wants, of course, to buy real estate and find new ways to spend it - elevating the boys' popularity at school. Damian wants to use the money to do good, charitable things, as the saints advise him to do.But the money's not from God. It's from a train robbery, and the boys are in danger as long as they have it.Directed by Danny Boyle, who made SHALLOW GRAVE, TRAINSPOTTING and 28 DAYS LATER, MILLIONS is a film with strong values told from the perspective of children, yet it's also a wacky, funny, twisted visual stunner. I heard someone else refer to it as ""SHALLOW GRAVE for seven-year-olds."" It's got darkness in it, but, on the whole, it's a lovely picture about hope and faith. It's a well-acted tearjerker with thrills that will leave you happy. And, describing it, I sound like some shallow critic who speaks in blurbs, but this movie has an edge to it that makes it better than it ought to be.Boyle's pictures are always a bit twisted, always interesting to watch. His touches are all over the camera angles, the lighting, the editing and the overall look of the thing.

930442,A14QAT1XDSCLEO,B000AP04GK,Bitcetc,"[9, 10]","Hagiography::  the study of the lives of the saints.I've always wanted to use that word ""hagiography"", and this may be my only opportunity in a movie review. If I knew more about the study of the lives of saints or Catholic conventions, perhaps I would know whether ""Damian"" has a religious connotation beyond some familiar religiously-themed movie characters, and whether ""Damian"", a saintly little boy who is the hero of this piece, is symbolic. But while I muse and research, please go see this movie.Remember when you see this movie that it is a parable, a fable, a teaching tale. If one takes it as the literal story of two young motherless English brothers who are deciding what to do with a bag of money which fell from the sky into Damian's playhouse, one might become impatient with the actions of one or the other brother or of some thin spots in the plot. But after the initial ten minutes of camera tricks and time-lapse photography, and general show-casing of the director's (Danny Boyle's) camera skills already recognized from ""Trainspotting"", the story itself begins to shine through. The charm of a youngster enamoured of the lives of the saints, and who may be able to communicate with the saints, begins to assert itself.While Damian believes the money is from God and must be distributed to the poor, his too-street-smart older brother believes they should invest in real estate. This dilemma has a time limit, however, as the British pounds in the bag must be converted into Euros, or become worthless, within days. Also spurred by the clock's ticking down on the value of this cache is the very ungodly thief who stole the money in the first place and who wants it back. And thusly is the question whether the love of money begets all evil illuminated by the light and the dark of this fable.Alexander Nathan Etel, the unworldly and generous little boy who wants to give all the money away, nonetheless steals the show. If enough people see him in this sweet (but neither mawkish nor maudlin) tale, we may hear his name again in award season. He's really good, and completely charming. The movie is our own little heavenly gift, and we may keep its moral and the good feeling from it as long as we like.

Anderson,"[1, 3]","""Millions"" is a rather surprising film from director Danny Boyle, who's previously made films featuring heroin addicts (""Trainspotting"") and zombies (""28 Days Later""). With a screenplay by Frank Cottrell Boyce (based on his novel), ""Millions"" tells the story of an English boy by the name of Damian whose chief interest is the lives of saints, memorizing their birth and death dates and miracles. He has just moved to a new community with his brother and recently widowed father.When Damian (Alex Etel) finds over 200,000 pounds he is advised by his friends the saints (who appear to him and him alone) to give the money to the poor. His brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), would rather invest in electronic goods and perhaps real estate. But they don't have a lot of time to decide; the film takes place in a possible future when England is only a dozen days away from switching from the pound to the Euro (when their fortune, left in pounds, will become worthless). Damian believes the money is a gift from God, but I don't think I'm spoiling too much to let on that the money may have a more unsavory origin.Boyle delights in fancy camera tricks and fantasy sequences, but he never strays far from the emotional core of the story of a grieving family that is suddenly given a wonderful opportunity which may turn into a curse.",5,Reminded me of Luke 16: 1 - 9,1269388800,"03 24, 2010",2010,1328,"['Millions', 'rather', 'surprising', 'film', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'who', 'previously', 'made', 'films', 'featuring', 'heroin', 'addicts', 'Trainspotting', 'zombies', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'screenplay', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'based', 'novel', 'Millions', 'story', 'English', 'boy', 'name', 'Damian', 'chief', 'interest', 'lives', 'saints', 'memorizing', 'birth', 'death', 'dates', 'miracles', 'just', 'moved', 'new', 'community', 'brother', 'recently', 'widowed', 'father.When', 'Damian', 'Alex', 'Etel', '200,000', 'pounds', 'advised', 'friends', 'saints', 'who', 'appear', 'alone', 'give', 'money', 'poor', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Lewis', 'McGibbon', 'would', 'rather', 'invest', 'electronic', 'goods', 'perhaps', 'real', 'estate', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'lot', 'time', 'decide', 'film', 'place', 'possible', 'future', 'when', 'England', 'only', 'dozen', 'days', 'away', 'switching', 'pound', 'Euro', 'when', 'fortune', 'left', 'pounds', 'will', 'become', 'worthless', 'Damian', 'money', 'gift', 'God', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', ""'m"", 'spoiling', 'too', 'much', 'let', 'money', 'may', 'have', 'more', 'unsavory', 'origin.Boyle', 'delights', 'fancy', 'camera', 'tricks', 'fantasy', 'sequences', 'never', 'far', 'emotional', 'core', 'story', 'grieving', 'family', 'suddenly', 'given', 'wonderful', 'opportunity', 'may', 'turn', 'curse']",N/A

From ""Trainspotting"" to ""28 Days Later,"" his films are cinematic masterpieces: nuanced, political, and thought-provoking. His work is generally dark and dramatic.  Moreover, it is progressive: not since Scott's Ripley have we seen a female hero like Selena from ""28 Days Later.""  Likewise, Boyle shed light on the post-colonial trauma of Scotland. This is the Boyle film-scholars know and adore.With Millions, we have a whiplash conversion: from thought-provoking director to family-friendly film-maker. Therefore, the scholars have rejected Millions, and Moms and Dads have embraced it.If you are seeking a wholesome film for your family gathering this holiday, Millions is a fine choice (in fact, much better than most!!) The child actors are exceptionally talented and the story-line just tense enough to maintain the attention of adults. If your children are not Catholic, they may be at a slight disadvantage since there is strong emphasis on the saints; nonetheless, this does not detract from the film, and can be used as a learning experience.Likewise, it MUST be noted that this is a futuristic film. The UK has not converted to the Euro yet. Boyle DELIBERATELY made the film futuristic: so, you may wish to discuss this aspect with your child (before he/she embarasses him/herself in Social Studies!!!)The cinematography is lovely, the music is beautiful, the conclusion is painfully predictable for an adult (but children will love it)!!It is a well-shot Christmas movie with strong Catholic values.

I wasn't sure what else he had done or was doing, but I knew that he was a great director with such a low-budget, and filming it on Digital Video. By chance, I would rent Millions and find that he was the director. I was thrilled and couldn't wait to see it.I had seen the preview for the film, and lately, I had taken a liking to british films since Fox Searchlight was distributing them so much. Even though I'm fifteen, the previews for Millions looked amazing. Even before seeing it, I knew I would right away be able to relate to it from my own imagination. Alexander Etel was amazing as Damian. I've never seen him before, but I know that any time soon he will coming out in all sorts of films if he already hasn't done so.Damian and Anthony are brothers living with their Dad in a new community. The boys are desperately trying to recooperate after the recent loss of Maureen, their mother. But when Damian finds a bag full of millions of pounds that just fell from the sky, he has a feeling that maybe God sent it to him. Maybe! With England days away from switching to the euro, Damian and Anthony try to get rid of it as much as possible. Though Damian, who sees the catholic saints visiting him constantly, wants to give it to the poor, Anthony wants to keep it for himself. Not to mention, the money may not have been from God after all.I found that the whole film is centered around the innocence we all experience as a child. Damian is that innocence, and Anthony is the form of normal people wanting all the money in the world. The saints, I found to be fun and imaginative in their simplicity. As Damian saw them, they all seemed to fit in with the situation, though the situation was not clearly stated until the end. And their halos were awesome! I think the burglar who stole the money could've very well been the form of Satan if you look at it.Later on, I found I was almost exactly like Damian. I used to always want to give all the money to the poor, and thought that everything given to me was from God, and that if I prayed hard enough things would fall from the sky from heaven. I still know God gives me everything, and my imagination still soars. Anyone who ever had an imagination will relate to this film. Even as difficult as a teenager like me, I could relate to this.Life is a very fragile thing, and I think that's one of the messages in Millions. You also have to have faith. Don't worry. When things happen to you, they happen, and when they don't, they don't. Think with the mind of a child. They never worry. Their lives are simple, and that's for reason. I wish I could go back to my childhood and then I could correct plenty of things. Money can never change anything, and thank God Damian figured that out before it was too late. I recommend Millions to anyone who ever once was a child.

MILLIONS may seem like a little family tale on the surface, but in Boyle's hands this story about the struggle between Janus ethics vaults off into magical realism, happily taking the audience along for a journey of wonder and joy and the importance of charity.Damian (Alexander Nathan Etel) and his older brother Anthony (Lewis Owen McGibbon) are moved by their father Ronnie (James Nesbitt) to  a new housing project after the untimely death of the boys' mother.  The brothers are devoted to each other yet Anthony is the pragmatist while Damian is the dreamer, a lad who regularly has visions and poignant converations with dead saints, always asking if they know anything about St. Maureen (his recently deceased mother).  Damian believes in miracles and when suddenly a Nike bag containing a quarter of a million British pounds falls on his playhouse he believes it is from God and that it is his responsibility to distribute the money to the poor.  When he shares the secret with Anthony, the latter's psyche begins to organize ways to spend and invest the money - because the British sterling will soon convert to the Euro making the bag's stash useless.The journey of how the two brothers cope with their instant fortune and how they cope with their family minus one forms the line of the film.  There are good guys, bad guys, various saints, hilarious encounters with mundane ethically bifurcated folks like a Mormon team - all of whom make the visual and emotional aspects of this film thoroughly entertaining.  The actors, especially young Atel, are superb and Boyle's use of the magical ignites the story into an unforgettable fable and tale of humanity.  Highly recommended for everyone to see.

Just as she knows that despite a looming and scary criminal, nothing bad will befall young Damian.  The saints who regularly visit him, to light joints or recast the miracle of the loaves and fishes, simply will not permit it.With that knowledge assured virtually from the opening scene of Millions, one can revel in the many nuanced pleasures it provides.  Start with the acting -- the two young brothers, Alex Etel and Lewis McGibbon, are natural and affecting, real in their individual responses to the loss of their mother.  James Nesbitt at their father, coping with his own grief as -- by turns stern and gentle -- he tries to help the boys through theirs, is just as good.  The cinematography, speeding up some scenes and fast cutting between others, achieves a fluid mix of reality and imagination, life through Damian's eyes.  The many touches of humor, particularly the sequences as the family tries to convert pounds to euros before the pound ceases being legal tender, bring a lightness to faith.  Some scenes replay in the mind well after the film ends -- Damian alone against a wall in his new school, held close by the camera that then pans slowly back gradually encompassing more and more of the school yard with kids at play, but never -- even as he grows steadily smaller -- leaving Damian's isolation.

The main character imagines he talks to saints all the time. He has their birthdates and death dates memorized. He addresses them like a baseball fan addressing his favorite ballplayer. It is hilarious. The movie uses special effects and the imagination sequences very creatively. The relationships between the brothers is very believable and funny. It is a tad more confusing with the relationships between the sons and the fathers. I did not always understand the dynamics. The plot, I think, loses its way in the end.

Although I'm also a fan of ""Trainspotting,"" I didn't even connect Mr. Boyle to all three films until a few minutes ago.This story is lovely, inspiring, surprising and educational.  Each time the character Damian met a Saint, I learned a little about religion and was amazed at the delivery by this innocent young boy with his lovely and stoic face.  The older brother, Anthony was equally as excellent, showing the determination and strength of the character, but not detracting from his sometimes obscured brotherly love.  The Saints were perfect delusions and the Latter-Day ""Saints"" were not.  The plot inspires discussion and reminds me of the time my sister and I found money outside of a department store and we were fortunate enough to receive it two weeks after we turned it in to security.  Some people thought we should have kept it, but I turned it in without a second's hesitation.

With that in mind, Damian and Anthony's dad moves them out of their old home and into a new one hoping to exorcise any painful memories.  Once moved in, Damian sets up a cardboard house along the railroad tracks where he can escape into his own little world.  While playing one day, a bag full of money literally falls on top of Damian's world.  He shares his good fortune with Anthony who immediately begins to strategize on how to invest the money wisely.  Unfortunately for the duo, the money will be useless in just a few days whenever the UK converts all of its money into Euros.  Damian, being a very, very devout Christian, decides to give the money to the poor because he believes that it is a gift from God.  Anthony, worried about things such as exchange and interest rates, tries to spend as much of his money on himself and stash some of it away in investments such as real estate.Of course, this wasn't a gift from God.  It was just one sack of a number of sacks of money strategically stolen and hidden by bank robbers.  One of them was supposed to pick up the bag that young Damian found, and quickly begins to follow the young boy in order to get his money back.  All of this is done without Damian's father knowing about this until one day at school, Damian makes a rather large contribution to a fund for poor children.  The lady who is collecting the donations (Daisy Donovan), falls not only for the boy's giving heart but for his father as well.As the story unfolds, Damian, Anthony, their dad and his new girlfriend struggle over what to do with the money.  All the while Damian is getting advice from Catholic Saints who visit him throughout the film.What happens to the money?  Does the criminal ever catch up to Damian?

930477,A6ADO7B6FUVN,B000AP04GK,"Kim Anehall ""www.cinematica.org""","[5, 6]","Danny Boyle has frequently displayed his visual storytelling skills through wide ranges of films such as the psychedelic Trainspotting (1996), the amusing Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise (2001), and the horrifying 28 Days Later... (2002).  All of his accomplishments display that he truly has the skill of visually telling stories, as all of them are unique and special in their own rights.  In addition, each of his cinematic creations offers some form of social criticism, and enlightening lessons for the audience to acquire.  Here in Millions Boyle enters the mind of the 7-year old Damian (Alexander Nathan Etel) that is dealing with a religions awakening and loss of his mother while moving into the suburban dream.  All of this combined with a godsend Nike bag full of cash that literally falls on top if his head provides an intriguing perspective on true goodness, materialism, and the cost of socioeconomic freedom.The visual language of Boyle has always been fascinating and Millions is not exception, it is exceptional with brilliant use of contrasts, angles, and other symbolic imagery.  Artistically, the opening scene with Damian and his brother Anthony (Lewis Owen McGibbon) standing with their bikes ready for a race in a small tunnel analogously presents a new beginning in a time of hurry and pursuit.  Furthermore, the scene moves rapidly together with Damian's narration explaining how the British nation will move from Pounds to Euros at the end of the year.  The goal of the race is a building site for a new suburban area to which Damian and Anthony intend to move with their father, as soon as their house is built.  Through a wonderfully imaginative use of stop-motion and computer animation Boyle sees that the audience experiences the complete construction of their house, which also suggestively brings the mind to the costs of the materials and work put into the house.  However, the two children's presence presents the idea of youthful obliviousness in regards to the monetary wheel of society.Through the carefully detailed character development in the beginning two very different characters materialize through Damian and Anthony.  Damian is often deep in thoughts pondering the moral choices in life while reflecting over the actions of saints and their fates, as he tries to find a way to better himself.  Much of his thoughtfulness is due to the loss of his mother whom he misses dearly, and occasionally he has revelations of saints.  One could say that Damian is far from what most people would call a normal child.  His brother Anthony on the other hand seizes the moment by exploiting human kindness and compassion by telling anyone from whom he can gain a favorable position that his mother is dead.  Through the exploitations of others sympathy, Anthony gains candy, kindness, and whatever else he needs at a time of desire.To nourish his spiritual and moral needs Damian builds a home, away from home, out of cardboard boxes.  It is also where he has one of his many visions of saints, and when he meets Clare of Assisi a miracle appears in the form of a Nike bag full of British Pounds.  In a similar manner that Anthony exploits people's kindness, the bag of money brings out the bad in people, as everyone who finds an opportunity of gaining some cash manipulates the situation to the fullest.  Nonetheless, Damian tries to accomplish acts of kindness and compassion to all people including his brother whose greed grows with the knowledge of the fortune in the bag.One of the more appealing traits of the story is the humanity of the tale, as Boyle accentuates the notion of human imperfection.  Some of these flaws emerge through the saints in Damian's visions, but also through Damian's own nave ignorance.  Yet, Damian learns in the process, as he innocently seeks a higher truth of moral righteousness.  However, he also learns that the money that fell in his lap has a different source than what he first thought and money often brings about dishonesty.  In the process, Boyle delivers a tale of understanding, grief, wisdom, and much more, as the tale follows the human materialistic desire.  In addition, Millions does not turn into a dry socioeconomic drama with strict symbolism in the traditional sense, but a playful venture of many human aspects that is full of amusement, suspense, and valuable lessons in regards the smaller things in life.",5,Brilliant Cinema for the Whole Family About Humanity's Imperfections...,1131753600,"11 12, 2005",2005,4409,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'frequently', 'displayed', 'visual', 'storytelling', 'skills', 'wide', 'ranges', 'films', 'such', 'psychedelic', 'Trainspotting', '1996', 'amusing', 'Vacuuming', 'Completely', 'Nude', 'Paradise', '2001', 'horrifying', '28', 'Days', 'Later', '2002', 'accomplishments', 'display', 'truly', 'skill', 'visually', 'telling', 'stories', 'are', 'unique', 'special', 'own', 'rights', 'addition', 'cinematic', 'creations', 'form', 'social', 'criticism', 'enlightening', 'lessons', 'audience', 'acquire', 'Here', 'Millions', 'Boyle', 'mind', '7-year', 'old', 'Damian', 'Alexander', 'Nathan', 'Etel', 'dealing', 'religions', 'awakening', 'loss', 'mother', 'moving', 'suburban', 'dream', 'combined', 'godsend', 'Nike', 'full', 'cash', 'literally', 'top', 'head', 'intriguing', 'perspective', 'true', 'goodness', 'materialism', 'cost', 'socioeconomic', 'freedom.The', 'visual', 'language', 'Boyle', 'always', 'been', 'fascinating', 'Millions', 'not', 'exception', 'exceptional', 'brilliant', 'use', 'contrasts', 'angles', 'other', 'symbolic', 'imagery', 'Artistically', 'opening', 'scene', 'Damian', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Lewis', 'Owen', 'McGibbon', 'standing', 'bikes', 'ready', 'race', 'small', 'tunnel', 'analogously', 'new', 'beginning', 'time', 'hurry', 'pursuit', 'Furthermore', 'scene', 'moves', 'rapidly', 'together', 'Damian', 'narration', 'explaining', 'how', 'British', 'nation', 'will', 'move', 'Pounds', 'Euros', 'end', 'year', 'goal', 'race', 'building', 'site', 'new', 'suburban', 'area', 'Damian', 'Anthony', 'intend', 'move', 'father', 'as', 'soon', 'house', 'built', 'wonderfully', 'imaginative', 'use', 'stop-motion', 'computer', 'animation', 'Boyle', 'audience', 'complete', 'construction', 'house', 'also', 'suggestively', 'mind', 'costs', 'materials', 'work', 'put', 'house', 'However', 'two', 'children', 'presence', 'idea', 'youthful', 'obliviousness', 'regards', 'monetary', 'wheel', 'society.Through', 'carefully', 'detailed', 'character', 'development', 'beginning', 'two', 'very', 'different', 'characters', 'materialize', 'Damian', 'Anthony', 'Damian', 'often', 'deep', 'thoughts', 'pondering', 'moral', 'choices', 'life', 'reflecting', 'actions', 'saints', 'fates', 'find', 'way', 'better', 'Much', 'thoughtfulness', 'due', 'loss', 'mother', 'whom', 'dearly', 'occasionally', 'revelations', 'saints', 'One', 'could', 'say', 'Damian', 'far', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'call', 'normal', 'child', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'other', 'hand', 'moment', 'exploiting', 'human', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'telling', 'anyone', 'whom', 'can', 'gain', 'favorable', 'position', 'mother', 'dead', 'exploitations', 'others', 'sympathy', 'Anthony', 'gains', 'candy', 'kindness', 'else', 'time', 'desire.To', 'nourish', 'spiritual', 'moral', 'needs', 'Damian', 'home', 'away', 'home', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'also', 'where', 'one', 'many', 'visions', 'saints', 'when', 'Clare', 'Assisi', 'miracle', 'form', 'Nike', 'bag', 'full', 'British', 'Pounds', 'similar', 'manner', 'Anthony', 'people', 'kindness', 'bag', 'money', 'out', 'bad', 'people', 'everyone', 'who', 'opportunity', 'gaining', 'cash', 'situation', 'fullest', 'Nonetheless', 'Damian', 'tries', 'accomplish', 'acts', 'kindness', 'compassion', 'people', 'including', 'brother', 'greed', 'knowledge', 'fortune', 'bag.One', 'more', 'appealing', 'traits', 'story', 'humanity', 'tale', 'Boyle', 'notion', 'human', 'imperfection', 'flaws', 'emerge', 'saints', 'Damian', 'visions', 'also', 'Damian', 'own', 'nave', 'ignorance', 'Damian', 'learns', 'process', 'innocently', 'higher', 'truth', 'moral', 'righteousness', 'However', 'also', 'money', 'fell', 'lap', 'different', 'source', 'what', 'first', 'thought', 'money', 'often', 'dishonesty', 'process', 'Boyle', 'tale', 'understanding', 'grief', 'wisdom', 'much', 'more', 'tale', 'human', 'materialistic', 'desire', 'addition', 'Millions', 'not', 'turn', 'dry', 'socioeconomic', 'drama', 'strict', 'symbolism', 'traditional', 'sense', 'playful', 'venture', 'many', 'human', 'aspects', 'full', 'amusement', 'suspense', 'valuable', 'lessons', 'regards', 'smaller', 'things', 'life']",N/A

The family of three (a father and his 2 sons) move out of a house to a new place.  They're all grieving for the wife/mother in their own way.Damian is an imaginative young boy, who has no problem entertaining himself.  He carries imaginary conversations with notable Christian saints.  Anthony is the older brother who puts on this tough look.One day, a large bag of money falls on top of Damian's play fort, which Damian notifies Anthony.  They both decide to keep hush about the money.  However, they both have different approaches of how to spend the money.  Damian gives money to whomever needs it the most, especially to those he perceives as poor.  Meanwhile, Anthony is tight with money by spending it only on himself or on things that will increase values.However, there are 2 things going on as well.  Britain will be converting their pounds to euros.  So, pounds must either be spent or deposited to bank accounts within a few days.  Otherwise, the pounds will no longer be valid.  Another thing is that someone else wants that bag of money.  The robber gets a hold of Damian and threatens him.  Damian is scared and agrees to comply with the robber's demands.However, the money becomes overwhelming for the boys.  They get their dad involved as well as his new girlfriend.*Millions* is a wonderful movie about how people react to a large sum of money.  Of course, there are other sub-stories in this movie.

930481,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000AP04GK,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[3, 4]","The main plot of ""Millions"" is something that you have undoubtedly seen in some form in the past.  Damian (Alex Etel) is a seven-year-old British lad who creates his own adventures out of giant cardboard boxes.  He is in the middle of one such fantasy when a bag filled with thousands and thousands (""They call them 'millions'"" as Harmonica explained in ""C'era una volta il West"") of British pounds literally lands in front of him.  Damian brings the money home to show to his nine-year-old brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), who immediately starts counting the money and calculating how much of what it can buy.  As for Damian, he thinks the money should go to poor people.  There are two problems that apply equally to both of the young boy's plans.  The first is that the bad guy (Christopher Fulford) who was supposed to collect the bag of money when it was tossed off of a train during a robbery has figured out who has it and he wants it back.  Since this is clearly a family comedy and not a thriller you should have a general idea of what is going to happen from this point on in this charming 2005 film.But director Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later"") and writer Frank Cottrell Boyce (""Hilary and Jackie"") have thrown two twists into this basic mix to save ""Millions"" from being just another family comedy.  The first is that all of this happens as the deadline approaches for when the U.K. coverts once and for all to the Euro.  This idea only serves to make the conflicting ideas of what the brothers should do with the money more interesting, since continuing to hide it under the bed is not going to work out.  But what elevates ""Millions"" to the next level is that Damien not only has the same sort of knowledge of Christian saints that more English lads would have for such mundane things as the players for Manchester United, he appears to get visited by them.  If Damien turns around and sees some figure in a robe wearing a halo, he instantly recognizes which saint it is, why they died, and usually what they are the patron saint of (although the patron saint of television is news to him).Damien might simply seem like another cute British kid, but there is a key element of pathos inherent in his conversations with the saints.  It turns out the Damien and Anthony's mother has died, and while Anthony sees this as an opportunity to get free stuff when he lets someone know his mum is dead, the question Damien always wants to ask all of the saints is whether they have run into Saint Maureen.  Damien thinks the money has fallen from the sky and is therefore a gift from God, but when Anthony learns otherwise Damien decides that instead of giving it to the poor it needs to be turned in to the police.  Anthony is equally horrified by either idea and continues to figure out the best way to get the most for their money.  The problem is that two pre-adolescent boys are no good at keeping a secret about a large stash of money, which is why not only the bad guy but most of the people in the neighborhood end up hearing about it.All of this takes place in the new suburban development in which their father, Ronnie (James Nesbitt), has settled the two boys.  The local copper (Pearce Quigley) has warned them that they will probably be burgled, but the boys are more worried about all the attention that dad is paying to Dorothy (Daisy Donovan).  Stilll, you had to know that sooner or later the realism of such things as family and the police were going to intrude on the magic and fun that Damien has been enjoying.  But there is more going on here with these two brothers that makes them more than some sort of Goofus and Gallant with lots of cash, although the fact that the pair represent such opposite approaches and that the path one of them is taking is probably superior to that of the other should dawn on most kids who watch this film.Ultimately, I bought into the magic much more than the reality.  Yes, the thought of having large amounts of cash on hand inspired my own wish list of immediate fulfillment, but for me the best part of the movie was when the saints showed up for a visit.  I like the fact that St. Peter (Alun Armstrong) does not like to be reminded of when he died, that St. Joseph (Nasser Memarzia) is into discussing character motivation, and that St. Clare (Kathryn Pogson) presents heaven in a slightly different light.  More importantly, they are there to help, even though it seems like Damien might need somebody assigned specifically to watch over him and his problems.""Millions"" is one of those kids movies that kids will probably not enjoy as much as their parents, which is fine with me because I have just about put my days of being a kid behind me.  But I would find it hard to believe that kids the same age as Damien and Anthony are going to even understand let alone really appreciate what Boyle and Boyle have created here.  So I suspect the target audience for this particular film is a bit higher.",5,"What happens in this movie is not suspicious, it's unusual",1130976000,"11 3, 2005",2005,4980,"['main', 'plot', 'Millions', 'something', 'have', 'undoubtedly', 'seen', 'form', 'past', 'Damian', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'seven-year-old', 'British', 'lad', 'who', 'own', 'adventures', 'giant', 'cardboard', 'boxes', 'middle', 'one', 'such', 'fantasy', 'when', 'bag', 'filled', 'thousands', 'thousands', 'call', ""'millions"", 'Harmonica', 'explained', ""C'era"", 'una', 'volta', 'il', 'West', 'British', 'pounds', 'literally', 'front', 'Damian', 'money', 'home', 'show', 'nine-year-old', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'Lewis', 'McGibbon', 'who', 'immediately', 'counting', 'money', 'calculating', 'how', 'much', 'what', 'can', 'buy', 'Damian', 'money', 'should', 'go', 'poor', 'people', 'are', 'two', 'problems', 'apply', 'equally', 'young', 'boy', 'plans', 'first', 'bad', 'guy', 'Christopher', 'Fulford', 'who', 'was', 'supposed', 'collect', 'bag', 'money', 'when', 'was', 'tossed', 'train', 'robbery', 'figured', 'out', 'who', 'back', 'clearly', 'family', 'comedy', 'not', 'thriller', 'should', 'have', 'general', 'idea', 'what', 'going', 'happen', 'point', 'charming', '2005', 'film.But', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Trainspotting', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'Hilary', 'Jackie', 'have', 'thrown', 'two', 'twists', 'basic', 'mix', 'save', 'Millions', 'being', 'just', 'family', 'comedy', 'first', 'deadline', 'approaches', 'when', 'U.K.', 'coverts', 'once', 'Euro', 'idea', 'only', 'make', 'conflicting', 'ideas', 'what', 'brothers', 'should', 'do', 'money', 'more', 'interesting', 'continuing', 'hide', 'bed', 'not', 'going', 'work', 'out', 'what', 'Millions', 'next', 'level', 'Damien', 'not', 'only', 'same', 'sort', 'knowledge', 'Christian', 'saints', 'more', 'English', 'lads', 'would', 'have', 'such', 'mundane', 'things', 'players', 'Manchester', 'United', 'get', 'visited', 'Damien', 'around', 'figure', 'robe', 'wearing', 'halo', 'instantly', 'saint', 'why', 'died', 'usually', 'what', 'are', 'patron', 'saint', 'patron', 'saint', 'television', 'news', '.Damien', 'might', 'simply', 'seem', 'cute', 'British', 'kid', 'key', 'element', 'pathos', 'inherent', 'conversations', 'saints', 'out', 'Damien', 'Anthony', 'mother', 'died', 'Anthony', 'opportunity', 'get', 'free', 'stuff', 'when', 'someone', 'know', 'mum', 'dead', 'question', 'Damien', 'always', 'ask', 'saints', 'have', 'run', 'Saint', 'Maureen', 'Damien', 'money', 'fallen', 'sky', 'therefore', 'gift', 'God', 'when', 'Anthony', 'otherwise', 'Damien', 'instead', 'giving', 'poor', 'be', 'turned', 'police', 'Anthony', 'equally', 'horrified', 'idea', 'figure', 'out', 'best', 'way', 'get', 'most', 'money', 'problem', 'two', 'pre-adolescent', 'boys', 'are', 'good', 'keeping', 'secret', 'large', 'stash', 'money', 'why', 'not', 'only', 'bad', 'guy', 'most', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'end', 'up', 'hearing', 'it.All', 'place', 'new', 'suburban', 'development', 'father', 'Ronnie', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'settled', 'two', 'boys', 'local', 'copper', 'Pearce', 'Quigley', 'warned', 'will', 'probably', 'be', 'burgled', 'boys', 'are', 'more', 'worried', 'attention', 'dad', 'paying', 'Dorothy', 'Daisy', 'Donovan', 'Stilll', 'had', 'know', 'sooner', 'later', 'realism', 'such', 'things', 'family', 'police', 'were', 'going', 'intrude', 'magic', 'fun', 'Damien', 'been', 'enjoying', 'more', 'going', 'here', 'two', 'brothers', 'more', 'sort', 'Goofus', 'Gallant', 'lots', 'cash', 'fact', 'pair', 'represent', 'such', 'opposite', 'approaches', 'path', 'one', 'taking', 'probably', 'superior', 'other', 'should', 'dawn', 'most', 'kids', 'who', 'watch', 'film.Ultimately', 'bought', 'magic', 'much', 'more', 'reality', 'Yes', 'thought', 'having', 'large', 'amounts', 'cash', 'hand', 'inspired', 'own', 'wish', 'list', 'immediate', 'fulfillment', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'was', 'when', 'saints', 'showed', 'up', 'visit', 'fact', 'St.', 'Peter', 'Alun', 'Armstrong', 'not', 'like', 'be', 'reminded', 'when', 'died', 'St.', 'Joseph', 'Nasser', 'Memarzia', 'discussing', 'character', 'motivation', 'St.', 'Clare', 'Kathryn', 'Pogson', 'heaven', 'slightly', 'different', 'light', 'More', 'importantly', 'are', 'there', 'help', 'even', 'Damien', 'might', 'need', 'somebody', 'assigned', 'specifically', 'watch', 'problems', 'Millions', 'one', 'kids', 'movies', 'kids', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', 'parents', 'fine', 'have', 'just', 'put', 'days', 'being', 'kid', 'would', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'same', 'age', 'Damien', 'Anthony', 'are', 'going', 'even', 'understand', 'let', 'alone', 'really', 'appreciate', 'what', 'Boyle', 'Boyle', 'have', 'created', 'here', 'So', 'suspect', 'target', 'audience', 'particular', 'film', 'bit', 'higher']",N/A

930484,A17BUUBOU0598B,B000AP04GK,"Mark ""Technology, Music and Movies""","[1, 2]","Millionsis a very charming movie about a young boy and his brother who happen to stumble upon something many of us have dreamed about at one point or another: a bag of cash that *literally* falls from the sky.  The question is, what does one do with such good fortune?  And when you discover that the source of this blessing is not very divine, how does that change the way you deal with this situation.Part of the challenge of rating a movie like this is that it is so charming and direct that those of us who are cynical can't help but to be blinded by the *Hollywood* happy-ending feel good nature of this movie.  This may be the perfect litmus test for cynicism.  But if you take the movie at face value, it's actually a fairly well-made movie with an uplifting message.  Certainly, the message is not a very realistic one, and there are some small plot elements that require suspension of disbelief.  But even if you view this as an allegorical tale, if you let your inner kid view this movie you will be able to accept those leaps of faith.Employing child actors is a practice that might be over-used in films of the past 10 years.  In a sense, the honest commitment of child actors seems to earn directors a free pass.  In this case, the work of both the actors and director Danny Boyle deserve all the praise they have been given.  Whatever holes exist in the story itself are filled by the acting and direction.  And the fact is that this movie is very charming!  Alex Etel in particular really shines on the screen.  Perhaps they edited out the bad takes, but the camera really seems to love this kid!I think this movie is perfect for everybody: kids and families will have a lot of fun watching this wholesome take on an unsavory adventure, and even old jaded loners like me can enjoy this.  Those who are unable to make out the English and Scottish accents can simply turn on the English subtitles.

930489,A1FG91CM8221X1,B000AP04GK,Miles D. Moore,"[5, 6]","Danny Boyle, director of ""Trainspotting"" and ""Shallow Grave,"" has done the unexpected: he's made a film for the whole family, and a very fine, funny, touching one it is. ""Millions"" is about Damian and Anthony, two small brothers in a North-of-England Catholic elementary school who have recently lost their mother. One day a bag containing more than 200,000 pounds comes crashing into Damian's cardboard playhouse. Anthony, the older, more materialistic brother, wants to buy cool stuff with the money (including real estate). But Damian--a pious, imaginative child who has regular visions of the saints--wants to give the money to the poor, however loosely defined and wherever he might find them. Complicating both their efforts are (a) the sinister thug who comes looking for the money, and (b) the fact that Britain is set to switch from the pound to the euro in a few weeks' time. Using surrealistic, fragmented, state-of-the-art film techniques--and aided greatly by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle and editor Chris Gill--Boyle creates a funny, sometimes harrowing but always involving story of extraordinary events seen through a child's eyes. It is giving away nothing to say that faith, hope and charity triumph at film's end. ""Millions"" has aspects in common with two other films about children, ""In America"" (the magic realism of a child's world) and ""Ponette"" (children mourning the loss of a parent). It is every bit as good as either of these fine films. The adult cast--led by the always-reliable James Nesbitt as Damian and Anthony's dad--is uniformly excellent, while Alex Etel (Damian) and Lewis McGibbon (Anthony) are as natural and touching as any child actors who ever stepped before a camera. Set at Christmastime, ""Millions"" deserves to join ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Story"" as a perennial Christmas favorite.",5,"A touching, imaginative film about faith, hope and charity.",1114387200,"04 25, 2005",2005,1850,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'director', 'Trainspotting', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'done', 'unexpected', 'made', 'film', 'whole', 'family', 'very', 'fine', 'funny', 'touching', 'one', 'Millions', 'Damian', 'Anthony', 'two', 'small', 'brothers', 'North-of-England', 'Catholic', 'elementary', 'school', 'who', 'have', 'recently', 'lost', 'mother', 'One', 'day', 'bag', 'containing', 'more', '200,000', 'pounds', 'crashing', 'Damian', 'cardboard', 'playhouse', 'Anthony', 'older', 'more', 'materialistic', 'brother', 'buy', 'cool', 'stuff', 'money', 'including', 'real', 'estate', 'Damian', 'pious', 'imaginative', 'child', 'who', 'regular', 'visions', 'saints', 'give', 'money', 'poor', 'however', 'loosely', 'defined', 'might', 'find', 'Complicating', 'efforts', 'are', 'sinister', 'thug', 'who', 'looking', 'money', 'b', 'fact', 'Britain', 'set', 'switch', 'pound', 'euro', 'few', 'weeks', 'time', 'Using', 'surrealistic', 'fragmented', 'state-of-the-art', 'film', 'techniques', 'aided', 'greatly', 'cinematographer', 'Anthony', 'Dod', 'Mantle', 'editor', 'Chris', 'Gill', 'Boyle', 'funny', 'sometimes', 'harrowing', 'always', 'involving', 'story', 'extraordinary', 'events', 'seen', 'child', 'eyes', 'giving', 'away', 'nothing', 'say', 'faith', 'hope', 'charity', 'triumph', 'film', 'end', 'Millions', 'aspects', 'common', 'two', 'other', 'films', 'children', 'America', 'magic', 'realism', 'child', 'world', 'Ponette', 'children', 'mourning', 'loss', 'parent', 'bit', 'as', 'good', 'fine', 'films', 'adult', 'cast', 'led', 'always-reliable', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'Damian', 'Anthony', 'dad', 'uniformly', 'excellent', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'Damian', 'Lewis', 'McGibbon', 'Anthony', 'are', 'natural', 'touching', 'child', 'actors', 'who', 'ever', 'stepped', 'camera', 'Set', 'Christmastime', 'Millions', 'join', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'A', 'Christmas', 'Story', 'perennial', 'Christmas', 'favorite']",N/A

Brothers Damian and Anthony Cunningham have just moved with their father (James Nesbitt) to a bigger house in the suburbs and started at a new school when a gym bag full of money lands on Damian's play house near the railroad tracks. Damian (Alex Etel) is a religious boy who has unusual visions of Saints and Martyrs, and he believes the money is a gift from God to help the poor. Anthony (Lewis McGibbon) is more worldly and wants to invest and spend for himself. But there are only a couple of weeks until ""E Day"", when Great Britain will abandon pounds sterling for the euro, and someone is looking for his missing  230,000.Eight-year-old Alex Etel is the star of ""Millions"", and he carries it well. He doesn't have any great screen presence, but his perfect line delivery and his nave earnestness steal the show. Ten-year-old Lewis McGibbon nails his role just as well. It's great to see real character roles for children instead of their usual performing seal acts in movies. Pearce Quigley is a welcome addition to the cast as a friendly and slightly comical neighborhood policeman. The best thing about ""Millions"" is that, through moments of magic and materialism, the film has an overwhelming quality of being full of life. I think the production design and Damian's sincerity get credit for that. ""Millions"" is a film about children, but its suitable for all ages. And it makes a better ""Christmas"" or ""holiday"" film than any I've seen.The DVD (Fox Home Entertainment 2005):  Bonus features include a soundtrack spot (30 sec), a theatrical trailer (2  min), 10 deleted scenes,  a ""DVD Cutdown"" (4 min), which is an abstract of the film, similar to a trailer, a ""Behind the Scenes"" featurette, and an audio commentary. ""Behind the Scenes"" (13  min) has 4 parts which discuss, respectively, the role of money in the film, the Saints, creating the film's generous spirit, and filming the robbery scene. Includes interviews with director Danny Boyle, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce, and the cast.

JEFFREY MCMAHON ""herculodge""","[2, 2]","Defying the cynical zeitgeist of modern Hollywood, this British entry tells the tale of a little boy Damian who, having lost his mother, copes by fantasizing about saints and martyrs. These imaginary companions give him wisdom and solace as he grieves his mother's death and deals with an older brother who, loving money and business, is his opposite. A strange occurance, a bundle of millions seemingly from heaven, drops into Damian's lap and here the plot begins. The rest of the film is Damian's struggle to give the money to the poor in the face of the world's evil love for money. For Damian, the only way to deal with suffering and evil in the world in general and the death of his mother specifically is by following the edict to love your brother and give all that you have to the poor. His feverish faith in this principle gets him into trouble in a fable about greed and charity.Some of the plot points are hard to follow and the thick British accents require one to put English subtitles on the DVD format, but other than that it's a fairly quickly-paced film. I was puzzled, however, by the shifts in tone. At times its tone is sweet like a young adult film; other times it is more edgey with hip rock music and flashbacks like cuts from the masterpiece film Sexy Beast.

Their mother has passed rather recently and the family tries to make a new life in a new home.One of the two boys has an extremely active imagination and through which is often visited by dead Saints. He has studied documentation for any Saint he can get his hands on. He realizes that he often times sees things that are not there which is why he goes to get his older brother when a duffel bag full of money lands next to the fort he built by the train tracks.The question arises of how to spend it all without telling their dad about it and while ensuring that none of the money (British pounds) becomes useless as the conversion to Euros is only days away.The younger boy wants to use all of it to help those in need while his brother begins to research an investment portfolio.I cannot say that I was not disappointed. Throughout the movie I just thought they could have done more with the story. Aside from the two boys, character development was a little weak. While I understand that the movie was centered around the two of the, I was hoping for a little more involvement from their father. It is not until the very end of the movie that we finally learn anything about it and at that point, why bother?The ending overall was good. In previews I had a good idea what to expect and from that I was left touched. The very very end of the movie though, while symbolic, was probably unnecessary.I liked the movie, sure. I do not think it was nearly as good as I had expected, though.

I figured it would be a sappy sentimental kids film about how it's better to give money away than to keep it.Well, part of that was right, but mostly I was way off.  It is a film for all ages.  It's smart enough to keep the cleverest mind entertained and it deftly avoids sinking into sacharin cuteness that could be a trap.Fortunately they found the right child for the lead, Alex Keitel.  His seven year old innocence is what carries the film and his performance totally avoids the over-cuteness that has plagued many child actors...probably thanks to the director.  The other characters are well cast too, James Nesbitt is totally believable as the new widower trying to play both mom and dad to the boys.  He's cute, too, and it's nice to see his eyes light up when he meets the pretty social worker who visits the school. Even though she's a relatively minor character she brings a great deal of warmth, humor and hope to the family. Their relationship is a nice sub-plot.I loved the apparitions of the saints.  The overall theme of spirituality is a tough one to tackle in this day and age.  It seems that so many film makers are afraid to deal with it, lest they be criticized as archaic and ""religious.""  (a bad word for many in Hollywood and elsewhere, too)  Here the film makers strike just the right tone.  We are charmed by the innocent belief of the small boy.  Every time he meets one of the ""genuine"" saints, he asks if they've met St. Maureen, yet.  (his mom).  He keeps one of her dresses in his hideout.  The obvious difficulty he's having of dealing with his mother's death is big part of the film, but again, we're never hit over the head with it.  The scene where she does appear is a heart-breaker---bring Kleenex!I think this is a really good achievement, bringing together comedy, mystery, spirituality and even a little romance!

930498,A2WL02ENWFU9PM,B000AP04GK,Rex Macaroe,"[8, 10]","I was staying at my grandmother's house when I received Millions from Netflix. She doesn't own a DVD player, so we watched it on my $ 1100  HP desktop notebook with built-in speakers, a high definition widescreen monitor, a DVD ROM/DVD-RW/CD-RW, firewire ports for uploading video, and more USB ports than you can shake a stick at. We set it up on her kitchen table, popped in the DVD, turned out the lights, and watched in awe (and uncomfortable wooden chairs) as Danny Boyle's masterpiece unfolded before us.If you ask me, family films are the most difficult types of film to make because the genre provides itself an excuse for poor quality: it's for kids, who cares? But when a family film is willing to touch on difficult subjects (family, economy, religion) in an honest and fascinating way without condescending to the audience, that's when you achieve magic.Damian and Anthony are dealing with a difficult point in their lives. Their mother just died, and they're adjusting to a new town. When they first step foot into their new home, Anthony is ecstatic that they were able to get such a big house at such a small price given the trends of real estate value and such (he gets his own room!). Damian, on the other hand, isn't really concerned with this. He's busy getting visits from his favorite saints who pop in occasionally to give him advice. They might know ""Saint Maureen."" Besides, all this extra space is pretty intimidating (and he has to sleep alone).One day, a bag full of money falls from the sky, and the brothers have to decide what to do with it. They don't have much time because in two weeks Britain switches to the Euro. Damian naturally wants to give it to the poor, but this proves to be more complicated than he expected for a variety of reasons. Anthony naturally wants to invest in a condo or open a bank account so they keep their value even after the currency change. Again, there's a problem: ten-year-olds can't purchase real estate or open bank accounts with parental supervision.Granted, the movie is a little predictable. It doesn't take much imagination to figure out where the money came from, and I don't really have to explain who that suspicious man is that Damian meets where the money fell. His final encounter with a saint was inevitable from the opening scenes (even my little sister predicted the lines of their exchage), but none of that matters when a film has this much power, honesty, and heart.Danny Boyle is a director known for making films you shouldn't take your kids to see. Trainspotting, more than any other film I've seen, understands the nature of addiction. 28 Days Later is one of the bleakest and most intense horror films of the new millenium. Here he has crafted his best film by applying the same insight to a much sweeter film. I'm hard-pressed to think of any other family film since The Hunchback of Notre Dame to dig this deep this well.

At least, that's what happened to me.The story is a smart ""what-if"" sort of premise, starting with the idea that Great Britain is in a rush to convert their legal tender from Pounds Sterling to the Euro.  As the movie begins, the final date for this changeover is a little over a week away, after which the Pound will no longer be usable anywhere in Britain.  That's the story behind the story -- the real story begins when Damian, a young boy whose mother died recently, and who is prone to visions of saints, discovers a bag full of money (British pounds, of course) that has literally seemed to fall right out of the sky.  Damian tells his brother Anthony about the find, and they both agree that the only answer is that they should keep it a secret from their father, and spend it themselves.So, how can two boys spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in just over a week?  This is itself causes problems, as they both have different ideas of how to spend it.  Kind-hearted Damian wants to find people who need it and give it away to them, while Anthony, a little older and more cynical, is more concerned with using it to buy status and influence among their friends.The story that unfolds from this premise is clever and sharp -- never overly serious but always staying honest, keeping the eye on the ball and conveying a message about money and what it can do to people.  The real story of ""Millions"" is the story of family, of the brotherhood between Damian and Anthony, of their relationship with their father, and of the missing place where their mother once stood.  It has moments of hilarity, moments of fear, and moments of touching love, all of which balance nicely and make this a family film which is truly good for everyone in the family to see.  It doesn't pander or water down its story, but it also doesn't overdo it.""Millions"" is a little wonder of a film, a gift that you can give yourself just by watching it.  Its message about money and what it does is poignant and timely, but its deeper message about family, both family lost and family found, is what really makes it shine.Highly recommended for viewers of any age, who maintain at least a little bit of a sense of wonder.",5,"Inventive, Original, Funny, and Touching",1123718400,"08 11, 2005",2005,2326,"['one', 'movies', 'sometimes', 'run', 'purely', 'accident', 'once', ""'ve"", 'seen', ""'re"", 'so', 'glad', 'did', 'least', 'what', 'happened', 'me.The', 'story', 'smart', 'what-if', 'sort', 'premise', 'starting', 'idea', 'Great', 'Britain', 'rush', 'convert', 'legal', 'tender', 'Pounds', 'Sterling', 'Euro', 'movie', 'final', 'date', 'changeover', 'little', 'week', 'away', 'Pound', 'will', 'no', 'longer', 'be', 'usable', 'anywhere', 'Britain', 'story', 'story', 'real', 'story', 'when', 'Damian', 'young', 'boy', 'mother', 'died', 'recently', 'who', 'prone', 'visions', 'saints', 'bag', 'full', 'money', 'British', 'pounds', 'course', 'literally', 'seemed', 'fall', 'right', 'sky', 'Damian', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'find', 'agree', 'only', 'answer', 'should', 'keep', 'secret', 'father', 'spend', 'themselves.So', 'how', 'can', 'two', 'boys', 'spend', 'hundreds', 'thousands', 'pounds', 'just', 'week', 'problems', 'have', 'different', 'ideas', 'how', 'spend', 'Kind-hearted', 'Damian', 'find', 'people', 'who', 'need', 'give', 'away', 'Anthony', 'little', 'older', 'more', 'cynical', 'more', 'concerned', 'using', 'buy', 'status', 'influence', 'friends.The', 'story', 'premise', 'clever', 'sharp', 'never', 'overly', 'serious', 'always', 'staying', 'honest', 'keeping', 'eye', 'ball', 'conveying', 'message', 'money', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'people', 'real', 'story', 'Millions', 'story', 'family', 'brotherhood', 'Damian', 'Anthony', 'relationship', 'father', 'missing', 'place', 'where', 'mother', 'once', 'stood', 'moments', 'hilarity', 'moments', 'fear', 'moments', 'touching', 'love', 'balance', 'nicely', 'make', 'family', 'film', 'truly', 'good', 'everyone', 'family', 'see', ""n't"", 'pander', 'water', 'down', 'story', 'also', ""n't"", 'overdo', 'Millions', 'little', 'wonder', 'film', 'gift', 'can', 'give', 'just', 'watching', 'message', 'money', 'what', 'poignant', 'timely', 'deeper', 'message', 'family', 'family', 'lost', 'family', 'found', 'what', 'really', 'shine.Highly', 'recommended', 'viewers', 'age', 'who', 'maintain', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'sense', 'wonder']",N/A

I always avoided Boyle's films, save 28 Days Later..., because of my deep, abiding hatred for Trainspotting. Now, though, swayed by the critical acclaim (which is almost universal), I rented Millions to see if Boyle is, in fact, capable of making a decent comedy-drama. Surprise--he is.Millions is the story of Damian (Alex Etel, in his first screen role), a kid who has a huge bag of cash fall--literally--into his lap a week before England converts to the Euro--so he's rich, for the sum total of a single week, unless he can find some way to change the money without being suspected of any wrongdoing or give it away to charity. His materialistic brother is all for the former option, while Damian, who's obsessed with Christianity and often sees (and converses with) the saints of antiquity, likes the latter idea. Unfortunately, he doesn't think too hard about it, and one particular sizeable donation draws the attention of Dorothy (Daisy Donovan), who finds herself both intrigued by the charitable nature of Damian, and attracted to his recently-widowed father (James Nesbitt). The four of them, and a cast of neurotic minor characters, count down the week to Euroization, but the original owners of the bag of money haven't forgotten about it...While it's not as out-and-out hilarious as one might expect from such a ludicrous premise, it does fire on enough cylinders to make it well worth watching. The plot is crazy enough to keep everything moving, and the characters are as believable as possible given their unbelievable situations. (This rule is waived for some of the minor characters who exist in the film just for laughs--the Mormon collective at the end of the street, for example--but even those characters are at least consistently funny.)Surprisingly good. *** ",4,Our Mum's dead!,1180137600,"05 26, 2007",2007,1928,"['Millions', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '2004', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'Danny', 'Boyle', '2002', 'have', 'say', ""'m"", 'pretty', 'impressed', 'always', 'avoided', 'Boyle', 'films', 'save', '28', 'Days', 'Later', 'deep', 'abiding', 'hatred', 'Trainspotting', 'Now', 'swayed', 'critical', 'acclaim', 'almost', 'universal', 'rented', 'Millions', 'see', 'Boyle', 'fact', 'capable', 'making', 'decent', 'comedy-drama', 'Surprise', 'story', 'Damian', 'Alex', 'Etel', 'first', 'screen', 'role', 'kid', 'who', 'huge', 'bag', 'cash', 'fall', 'literally', 'lap', 'week', 'England', 'converts', 'Euro', 'rich', 'sum', 'total', 'single', 'week', 'can', 'find', 'way', 'change', 'money', 'being', 'suspected', 'wrongdoing', 'give', 'away', 'charity', 'materialistic', 'brother', 'former', 'option', 'Damian', 'who', 'obsessed', 'Christianity', 'often', 'sees', 'saints', 'antiquity', 'latter', 'idea', 'Unfortunately', ""n't"", 'think', 'too', 'hard', 'one', 'particular', 'sizeable', 'donation', 'attention', 'Dorothy', 'Daisy', 'Donovan', 'who', 'intrigued', 'charitable', 'nature', 'Damian', 'attracted', 'recently-widowed', 'father', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'four', 'cast', 'neurotic', 'minor', 'characters', 'count', 'down', 'week', 'Euroization', 'original', 'owners', 'bag', 'money', 'have', ""n't"", 'forgotten', 'not', 'out-and-out', 'hilarious', 'one', 'might', 'expect', 'such', 'ludicrous', 'premise', 'fire', 'enough', 'cylinders', 'make', 'well', 'watching', 'plot', 'crazy', 'enough', 'keep', 'everything', 'moving', 'characters', 'are', 'as', 'believable', 'possible', 'given', 'unbelievable', 'situations', 'rule', 'waived', 'minor', 'characters', 'who', 'exist', 'film', 'just', 'laughs', 'Mormon', 'collective', 'end', 'street', 'example', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'least', 'consistently', 'funny', 'Surprisingly', 'good', '***']",N/A

Whereas other lads his age spend their time focusing on the stats of their favorite soccer players, Damian obsesses over the lives of saints, having committed to memory their years of birth and death, their notable acts of piety when they were alive, and their unique intercessory powers from beyond the grave.  In fact, these saints often appear to him in beatific visions, dispensing little life lessons from the great beyond.  Damian is also coping with the recent death of his mother and the sudden move with his father and older brother to a spanking new suburb just a stone's throw from the local factory.  One day a sack of money containing millions of pounds quite literally falls from the sky and lands on the young boy.  Believing this to be a gift from God, Damian immediately sets about dispensing his miraculous booty to anybody who looks like he could use a little leg up in the world.  What Damian doesn't count on is the complexity of human nature and the difficulty that such a seemingly beneficent ""miracle"" can cause in a person's life and the lives of those around him.""Millions"" has been quite consciously designed to resemble a parable.  It offers a simple story shot through with elements of magic realism and little life lessons about generosity and greed and how the love of money can indeed be the root of all evil.  With its noble central character and sainted figures hovering in the background, ""Millions"" could have been an unctuous, self-righteous and precious piece of feel-good filmmaking.  Instead, writer Frank Cottrell Boyce and director Danny Boyle keep it lighthearted and charming, thanks, primarily, to the fact that, for all his piety, Damian is really just an ordinary kid trying to do what's right in a world that doesn't always make that either an easy or even a sensible thing to do.  We truly sense that Damian is struggling not only to do what he knows he should but trying his best to understand why other people near and dear to him - his father and brother, especially - don't seem to have that same conviction.  ""Millions"" understands that one does not have to be ""evil"" to act in ways that promote one's own self-interest.  One merely has to be vulnerable and misguided - in other words, human - and it is the role of special people like Damian to help keep the rest of us on the proper path.""Millions"" would probably not work at all but for the wonderful performance by young Alexander Nathan Etel as Damian.  He makes the whole concept come alive with his guileless innocence, his innate knowledge of right and wrong, and his genuine sense of wonder about the world around him.  By never coming across as sappy or precocious, he roots the fantasy in a reality that makes us believe even the more preposterous elements of the tale.  Lewis McGibbon as his brother, and the always-reliable James Nesbitt as his dad, also turn in compelling, winning performances.There are times, admittedly, when the movie seems to be striving a bit too hard for its own good.  The religious imagery is sometimes laid on more thickly than perhaps it needs to be, and the plot line involving a creepy thief determined to get his hands on the loot injects an unnecessary note of melodrama into the movie.  And on a strictly technical level, the movie looks far too ""summery"" for a story ostensibly set in England during the Christmas season. But, despite its flaws, this is an imaginative, charming fantasy with a basic but universal message as its core.",3,flawed but generally charming fantasy,1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,3539,"['***1/2Damian', 'youngster', 'pious', 'years', 'other', 'lads', 'age', 'spend', 'time', 'focusing', 'stats', 'favorite', 'soccer', 'players', 'Damian', 'lives', 'saints', 'having', 'committed', 'memory', 'years', 'birth', 'death', 'notable', 'acts', 'piety', 'when', 'were', 'alive', 'unique', 'intercessory', 'powers', 'grave', 'fact', 'saints', 'often', 'appear', 'beatific', 'visions', 'dispensing', 'little', 'life', 'lessons', 'great', 'Damian', 'also', 'coping', 'recent', 'death', 'mother', 'sudden', 'move', 'father', 'older', 'brother', 'spanking', 'new', 'suburb', 'just', 'stone', 'throw', 'local', 'factory', 'One', 'day', 'sack', 'money', 'containing', 'millions', 'pounds', 'quite', 'literally', 'sky', 'young', 'boy', 'Believing', 'be', 'gift', 'God', 'Damian', 'immediately', 'dispensing', 'miraculous', 'booty', 'anybody', 'who', 'could', 'use', 'little', 'leg', 'up', 'world', 'What', 'Damian', ""n't"", 'count', 'complexity', 'human', 'nature', 'difficulty', 'seemingly', 'beneficent', 'miracle', 'can', 'cause', 'person', 'life', 'lives', 'Millions', 'been', 'quite', 'consciously', 'designed', 'resemble', 'parable', 'simple', 'story', 'shot', 'elements', 'magic', 'realism', 'little', 'life', 'lessons', 'generosity', 'greed', 'how', 'love', 'money', 'can', 'indeed', 'be', 'root', 'evil', 'noble', 'central', 'character', 'sainted', 'figures', 'hovering', 'background', 'Millions', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'unctuous', 'self-righteous', 'precious', 'piece', 'feel-good', 'filmmaking', 'Instead', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'director', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'keep', 'lighthearted', 'charming', 'thanks', 'primarily', 'fact', 'piety', 'Damian', 'really', 'just', 'ordinary', 'kid', 'trying', 'do', 'what', ""'s"", 'right', 'world', ""n't"", 'always', 'make', 'easy', 'even', 'sensible', 'thing', 'do', 'truly', 'sense', 'Damian', 'struggling', 'not', 'only', 'do', 'what', 'should', 'trying', 'best', 'understand', 'why', 'other', 'people', 'dear', 'father', 'brother', 'especially', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'same', 'conviction', 'Millions', 'one', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'evil', 'act', 'ways', 'promote', 'one', 'own', 'self-interest', 'One', 'merely', 'be', 'vulnerable', 'misguided', 'other', 'words', 'human', 'role', 'special', 'people', 'Damian', 'help', 'keep', 'rest', 'proper', 'path', 'Millions', 'would', 'probably', 'not', 'work', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'young', 'Alexander', 'Nathan', 'Etel', 'Damian', 'whole', 'concept', 'come', 'alive', 'guileless', 'innocence', 'innate', 'knowledge', 'right', 'wrong', 'genuine', 'sense', 'wonder', 'world', 'never', 'coming', 'sappy', 'precocious', 'fantasy', 'reality', 'believe', 'even', 'more', 'preposterous', 'elements', 'tale', 'Lewis', 'McGibbon', 'brother', 'always-reliable', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'dad', 'also', 'turn', 'compelling', 'winning', 'performances.There', 'are', 'times', 'admittedly', 'when', 'movie', 'be', 'striving', 'bit', 'too', 'hard', 'own', 'good', 'religious', 'imagery', 'sometimes', 'laid', 'more', 'thickly', 'perhaps', 'be', 'plot', 'line', 'involving', 'creepy', 'thief', 'determined', 'get', 'hands', 'loot', 'unnecessary', 'note', 'melodrama', 'movie', 'strictly', 'technical', 'level', 'movie', 'far', 'too', 'summery', 'story', 'ostensibly', 'set', 'England', 'Christmas', 'season', 'flaws', 'imaginative', 'charming', 'fantasy', 'basic', 'universal', 'message', 'core']",N/A

930504,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B000AP04GK,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 2]","In ""Millions,"" British director Danny Boyle seems almost to set himself the challenge of setting the situation at the heart of his earlier, dark film ""Shallow Grave,"" on its ear.  What happens when an unexpected windfall of somebody else's money befalls people? In ""Shallow Grave,"" it destroys the lives of the yuppy roommates; in ""Millions,"" it has some entertaining effects on the lives of two young boys.The boys here have just lost their mother, and moved to a suburban house with their father, a janitor.  The elder boy, Anthony, is rather a business-minded young man, worried about the tax implications of the find; the younger, Damian, a sweet and religious child, somewhat obsessed with the messy ends of saints.  Damian's in his playhouse, constructed of old boxes, near a railroad track, when he's literally hit by a gym bag overflowing with pound notes, falling from the sky.  Of course, he thinks, God must have sent it.  The conceit here is that the boys have only a few days to spend this money before it must be converted to euros; although, in actuality, Britain has not yet converted to euros. The boys have different agendas as to how to spend the money, and must deal with their schoolmates, the original thieves of the money, and a charming, disarming young woman who seems to be interested in taking their Mom's place.Boyle, who also gave us ""Trainspotting,"" and ""28 Days Later,"" has here given us a glowing fable of a movie.  Colors are bright and saturated, the action is fast-paced, scenes are frequently seen from a child's eye view, and the English midlands have never looked better.  Movies starring children are generally sentimental, but not this one.  Alex Etel is phenomenal as Damian.  The busy James Nesbitt plays the boys' puzzled father; the reliable Christopher Fulford the most visible villain.  The young woman moving into the family's life is cut in the bold, intelligent pattern of Samantha, female hero of ""28 Days Later.""  A selection of sturdy supporting actors plays the visiting saints, bad habits and all, to whom Damian turns for guidance.

The answer is `Millions,' off-beat fable about the life of two kids and money that was literally sent from the Heaven.Well, actually the money (229,320 UK pounds) originally belongs to the robbers in football team uniform, who pulled off another Great Train Robbery in Manchester. Accidentally one of the bag that contains money goes to two brothers Damian and Anthony, who live with their widowed father. Unbeknown to him or any adults, the kids try to figure out how to use the money, and they have to do it fast because England is going to change its currency (the film is set in the near future), and all the older bills would be useless.While elder brother Anthony spends money on anything money can buy (with enough cautions not to be conspicuous), Damian, who can `see' the saints and talk to them, thinks of giving the money to the 'poor' people. Unfortunately what Damian does with good intention brings more troubles to him and the people around.Contrived situation and sentimental conclusion aside, `Millions' is an unpredictable and enjoyable moral fable about the way how money can change the life, told without preachy messages. But at the same time, despite the opinions of many reviewers, I don't think `Millions' should be called `family picture' because the film's situations about the currency needs some explanations, and several scenes have sexual innuendoes. But of course, if you think kids can handle them, the film would be a nice choice.To a filmgoers like me, it is interesting to see Danny Boyle returning to his roots after his failed (so I think) attempt at Hollywood, `The Beach.' `Millions,' of which story reminds us of that of `Shallow Grave,' contains very British flavors, which heightens the charms of the film, His hectic storytelling and stylish camera works are there too. But probably you will find the two kids the most attractive part of the film, I don't think they show great acting, but they are natural, and that is the key to the success of the film, which Boyle knows very well.The film is not perfect, which could have been better with more lively descriptions of the adults, but it is a delightful experience of watching the kids' misadventures, followed by sweet message that tells money cannot buy something you really want. It's no new message, but is still sweet.",4,Two Boys Get Money Sent from 'Heaven': Off-Beat Moral Fable from the Director of 'Trainspotting',1133136000,"11 28, 2005",2005,2420,"['[', 'IN', 'FACT', '3.5', 'STARS', ']', 'What', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'Trainspotting', 'made', 'family', 'picture', 'answer', 'Millions', 'off-beat', 'fable', 'life', 'two', 'kids', 'money', 'was', 'literally', 'sent', 'Heaven.Well', 'actually', 'money', '229,320', 'UK', 'pounds', 'originally', 'robbers', 'football', 'team', 'uniform', 'who', 'pulled', 'off', 'Great', 'Train', 'Robbery', 'Manchester', 'Accidentally', 'one', 'bag', 'money', 'two', 'brothers', 'Damian', 'Anthony', 'who', 'live', 'widowed', 'father', 'Unbeknown', 'adults', 'kids', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'how', 'use', 'money', 'have', 'do', 'fast', 'England', 'going', 'change', 'currency', 'film', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'older', 'bills', 'would', 'be', 'useless.While', 'elder', 'brother', 'Anthony', 'money', 'anything', 'money', 'can', 'buy', 'enough', 'cautions', 'not', 'be', 'conspicuous', 'Damian', 'who', 'can', 'see', 'saints', 'talk', 'thinks', 'giving', 'money', ""'poor"", 'people', 'Unfortunately', 'what', 'Damian', 'good', 'intention', 'more', 'troubles', 'people', 'around.Contrived', 'situation', 'sentimental', 'conclusion', 'aside', 'Millions', 'unpredictable', 'enjoyable', 'moral', 'fable', 'way', 'how', 'money', 'can', 'change', 'life', 'told', 'preachy', 'messages', 'same', 'time', 'opinions', 'many', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'Millions', 'should', 'be', 'called', 'family', 'picture', 'film', 'situations', 'currency', 'explanations', 'several', 'scenes', 'have', 'sexual', 'innuendoes', 'course', 'think', 'kids', 'can', 'handle', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'nice', 'choice.To', 'filmgoers', 'interesting', 'see', 'Danny', 'Boyle', 'returning', 'roots', 'failed', 'think', 'attempt', 'Hollywood', 'Beach', 'Millions', 'story', 'Shallow', 'Grave', 'very', 'British', 'flavors', 'charms', 'film', 'hectic', 'storytelling', 'stylish', 'camera', 'works', 'are', 'there', 'too', 'probably', 'will', 'find', 'two', 'kids', 'most', 'attractive', 'part', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'show', 'great', 'acting', 'are', 'natural', 'key', 'success', 'film', 'Boyle', 'very', 'well.The', 'film', 'not', 'perfect', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'lively', 'descriptions', 'adults', 'delightful', 'experience', 'watching', 'kids', 'misadventures', 'followed', 'sweet', 'message', 'money', 'can', 'not', 'buy', 'something', 'really', 'want', 'new', 'message', 'still', 'sweet']",N/A

930510,A1C80B497LCYKA,B000AP04GK,"Waitsel Smith ""Movie Shark""","[0, 0]","Danny Boyle's film MILLIONS is photographically stunning and very entertaining. I would not consider it a family film, as it does not seem overly concerned with what most people consider family values. Nor would I consider it a kid's film, as it does not seem particularly interested in how kids think or talk, as writer Frank Cottrell Boyce has put some very non-kid jargon in the mouth of star Alexander Nathan Etel. So I would caution parents not to buy into the idea that this is a family or a kid's film; but it is a first-rate fantasy that is funny, interesting, and full of clever ideas, as well as even more clever cinematography. If this film doesn't win some awards for best cinematography, I'll be surprised. This is top-notch storytelling and filmmaking.The acting isn't chintzy either. It is British, so at times the dialogue might be difficult to understand. Etel plays Damian, a ten-year-old boy that holds conversations with Christian saints, and the one that discovers the money in question, which he wants to use to help the poor. He's constantly going around asking people if they're poor, so he can help them. It becomes hilariously difficult. Lewis Owen McGibbon plays Anthony, Damian's older brother, who has more ""practical"" ideas of how to spend the money - mainly, on himself. James Nesbitt plays Ronnie, the boys' widower father, who is dealing with a new house in the suburbs and raising two boys single-handedly. And Daisy Donovan plays the energetic and effervescent Dorothy, new friend to the boys and new flame for Ronnie.Damian thinks the money came from God, because it literally dropped out of the sky. When he finds out it was stolen, he wants to return it to its rightful owners. But the others talk him into another idea: either converting the pounds into Euros or spending it before it becomes worthless, as the countdown has begun for the Euro to replace the pound in England. In the process, countless problems arise, not the least of which are the robbers that actually stole the money and now want it back. Damian is convinced the money is causing all of them to change for the worse, so he comes up with a plan for getting rid of it for good.This film is delightful, but it is not for the little kiddies. Everything about it seems surreal, as famous saints walk in and out of scenes and life in suburbia is given an artistic look. Boyle's background in horror infuses the film with a touch of suspense. Even though it has a tone of innocence overall, it does cross the line into some adult themes from time to time. But adults in touch with the kid within will enjoy it, as will older kids. And, again, visually it is some of the best eye candy out there - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory notwithstanding.Waitsel Smith",4,SURREAL LOOK AT MONEY THROUGH THE EYES OF A KID - SORT OF,1133049600,"11 27, 2005",2005,2763,"['Danny', 'Boyle', 'film', 'MILLIONS', 'photographically', 'stunning', 'very', 'entertaining', 'would', 'not', 'consider', 'family', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'overly', 'concerned', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'consider', 'family', 'values', 'would', 'consider', 'kid', 'film', 'not', 'seem', 'particularly', 'interested', 'how', 'kids', 'think', 'talk', 'writer', 'Frank', 'Cottrell', 'Boyce', 'put', 'very', 'non-kid', 'jargon', 'mouth', 'star', 'Alexander', 'Nathan', 'Etel', 'would', 'caution', 'parents', 'not', 'buy', 'idea', 'family', 'kid', 'film', 'first-rate', 'fantasy', 'funny', 'interesting', 'full', 'clever', 'ideas', 'as', 'well', 'even', 'more', 'clever', 'cinematography', 'film', ""n't"", 'win', 'awards', 'best', 'cinematography', ""'ll"", 'be', 'surprised', 'top-notch', 'storytelling', 'filmmaking.The', 'acting', ""n't"", 'chintzy', 'either', 'British', 'so', 'times', 'dialogue', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'understand', 'Etel', 'Damian', 'ten-year-old', 'boy', 'conversations', 'Christian', 'saints', 'one', 'money', 'question', 'use', 'help', 'poor', 'constantly', 'going', 'asking', 'people', ""'re"", 'poor', 'can', 'help', 'hilariously', 'difficult', 'Lewis', 'Owen', 'McGibbon', 'Anthony', 'Damian', 'older', 'brother', 'who', 'more', 'practical', 'ideas', 'how', 'spend', 'money', 'mainly', 'James', 'Nesbitt', 'Ronnie', 'boys', 'widower', 'father', 'who', 'dealing', 'new', 'house', 'suburbs', 'raising', 'two', 'boys', 'single-handedly', 'Daisy', 'Donovan', 'energetic', 'effervescent', 'Dorothy', 'new', 'friend', 'boys', 'new', 'flame', 'Ronnie.Damian', 'money', 'came', 'God', 'literally', 'dropped', 'sky', 'When', 'was', 'stolen', 'return', 'rightful', 'owners', 'others', 'talk', 'idea', 'converting', 'pounds', 'Euros', 'spending', 'worthless', 'countdown', 'begun', 'Euro', 'replace', 'pound', 'England', 'process', 'countless', 'problems', 'arise', 'not', 'least', 'are', 'robbers', 'actually', 'stole', 'money', 'now', 'want', 'back', 'Damian', 'convinced', 'money', 'causing', 'change', 'worse', 'up', 'plan', 'getting', 'rid', 'good.This', 'film', 'delightful', 'not', 'little', 'kiddies', 'Everything', 'surreal', 'famous', 'saints', 'walk', 'scenes', 'life', 'suburbia', 'given', 'artistic', 'look', 'Boyle', 'background', 'horror', 'film', 'touch', 'suspense', 'Even', 'tone', 'innocence', 'overall', 'cross', 'line', 'adult', 'themes', 'time', 'time', 'adults', 'touch', 'kid', 'will', 'enjoy', 'will', 'older', 'kids', 'again', 'visually', 'best', 'eye', 'candy', 'there', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'notwithstanding.Waitsel', 'Smith']",N/A

It's a beautiful story of a kid who finds a huge bag of British pounds.  What happens to the money is laced with humor and quirky adventure.  The child is young enough to have a pure heart and still know right from wrong.  I would say the major theme of the film is money and its effect on people.  Sub-themes include dealing with the death of a mother, Christmas, Saints, and moving.The movie is fairly clean.  There is some brief mild language and cleavage.  Two young boys look closely at woman in a bra on the internet in a non-hormonal manner.  There are some scarey parts too.The portrayal of Mormons by the filmmakers is pretty silly.  They did have a kid in a wheelchair as an extra--nice to see the diversity!",5,Beautiful Story,1258243200,"11 15, 2009",2009,850,"['ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'movie', 'kids', 'adults', 'so', ""'ll"", 'say', 'thoughtful/mature', 'children', 'childlike', 'adults', 'beautiful', 'story', 'kid', 'who', 'huge', 'bag', 'British', 'pounds', 'What', 'money', 'laced', 'humor', 'quirky', 'adventure', 'child', 'young', 'enough', 'have', 'pure', 'heart', 'still', 'know', 'right', 'wrong', 'would', 'say', 'major', 'theme', 'film', 'money', 'effect', 'people', 'Sub-themes', 'include', 'dealing', 'death', 'mother', 'Christmas', 'Saints', 'moving.The', 'movie', 'fairly', 'clean', 'brief', 'mild', 'language', 'cleavage', 'Two', 'young', 'boys', 'look', 'closely', 'woman', 'bra', 'internet', 'non-hormonal', 'manner', 'are', 'scarey', 'parts', 'too.The', 'portrayal', 'Mormons', 'filmmakers', 'pretty', 'silly', 'did', 'have', 'kid', 'wheelchair', 'extra', 'nice', 'see', 'diversity']",N/A
