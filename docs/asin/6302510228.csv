317758,A3S87ZOPB3UM9N,6302510228,atmj,"[89, 100]","As an X-files fan, I have listened to and read a number of articles where David Duchovny referred to the Red Shoe Diaries, so I thought I would check it out.  When I read information on the tape I thought it was just another sex-oriented storyless movie.  Finally, I decided, on the strength of those references to give it a shot.I don't regret it.  There is sex no-doubt and pretty artfully done, but that's not really what the movie is all about.The only thing I didn't like was the character Alex's breathy phlegmatic voice.  However, given the movie, it may have been done delibrerately.The movie starts out surprisingly enough with the funeral of the central character Alex.  Jake (David Duchovny's character) is obviously the significant other.  The reactions of some of the family and friends are odd.  Friends are supportive, but the one family member the mother, is obviously accusational.After her funeral, while gathering Alex's clothing and shoes from where they lived, Jake stumbles on some diaries written by Alex.  Here he reads not only of her admiration and love for himself but of another man in her life. A shock you can well imagine.  A surprise as well when you have read of the satisfaction she has with her life and with Jake.As he reads on, she describes the situation of her meeting the &quot;other man; Tom&quot;.  Girls lets face it, he is an eyeful.This is a psychological movie in the sense that you have to understand and you will as you watch the movie, that Alex is a woman that is always being controlled by other people.  Based on comments by Alex, she often lets people take control.  When Jake meets her mother after their engagement, it is easy to see where this all began.  Her descriptions of her youth only reinforce it further.Too often when relationships are forged, so are the roles, and the person in control, remains the one in control.  Alex in her relationship with Jake was unable to change the balance of power.  It was no doubt Jake was in control, though hardly overbearing and from what I saw, also adoring and gentle. With the new situation with Tom, she hoped to have a situation she could control. She wanted to call the shots.This did not work out the way she hoped it would.  Alex realized in the situation with Tom, that is was not him, that was the problem, but her when the balance of power began to shift.  The ending was inevitable and the only time she could exercise control and not lose it.Jake after finding these diaries and reading them seeks out Tom, to understand why.  Through a travesty of a basketball challenge and interruption of well meaning friends a one-on-one match becomes a one sided conversation where Jake tears at Tom's philosophies in life, seeing him as only a philandering ladies man.  If not for the &quot;cheerleaders&quot;, he may have gotten different answers.  Needless to say, Jake wants to know what Alex saw in Tom.  He also trivializes Tom's interest in Alex.Tom is unaware that Jake was Alex's fiance.  Tom is also unaware that Alex is dead.  This scene and the later scene where Jake tells Tom of the death of Alex, while presenting him with the red shoes Alex bought from him, is a well done example of the possessiveness and grief of men.  You wonder if Jake is more upset by Alex's death or that Tom owned a part of her that Jake could not have.  Similarily it seems Tom reacts.I found the movie had an interesting insight into why people do what they do.  The character's of both Jake and Tom, never get the point.  Especially when it is apparent Jake continues to seek answers, even after being given them in Alex's diary.  I also see how things can go horribly wrong. Before you look outside, you must look inside.  Easy to say, not so easy to do.Given the nature of the other follow ons to this movie (they seem pure erotica) I may not see them, but I'm sure glad I saw this one.  Please note I saw the rated R version.  I'm not a prude but like to have a story in a movie that I'm going to dedicate 2 hours to.",4,This was a very good movie,967334400,"08 27, 2000",2000,4016,"['X-files', 'fan', 'have', 'listened', 'read', 'number', 'articles', 'where', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'referred', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'Diaries', 'thought', 'would', 'check', 'out', 'When', 'read', 'information', 'tape', 'thought', 'was', 'just', 'sex-oriented', 'storyless', 'movie', 'Finally', 'decided', 'strength', 'references', 'give', 'shot.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'regret', 'sex', 'no-doubt', 'pretty', 'artfully', 'done', 'not', 'really', 'what', 'movie', 'about.The', 'only', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'was', 'character', 'Alex', 'breathy', 'phlegmatic', 'voice', 'However', 'given', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'delibrerately.The', 'movie', 'out', 'surprisingly', 'enough', 'funeral', 'central', 'character', 'Alex', 'Jake', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'character', 'obviously', 'significant', 'other', 'reactions', 'family', 'friends', 'are', 'odd', 'Friends', 'are', 'supportive', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'mother', 'obviously', 'accusational.After', 'funeral', 'gathering', 'Alex', 'clothing', 'shoes', 'where', 'lived', 'Jake', 'diaries', 'written', 'Alex', 'Here', 'not', 'only', 'admiration', 'love', 'man', 'life', 'shock', 'can', 'well', 'imagine', 'surprise', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'have', 'read', 'satisfaction', 'life', 'Jake.As', 'situation', 'meeting', 'quot', 'other', 'man', 'Tom', 'quot', 'Girls', 'face', 'eyeful.This', 'psychological', 'movie', 'sense', 'have', 'understand', 'will', 'watch', 'movie', 'Alex', 'woman', 'always', 'being', 'controlled', 'other', 'people', 'Based', 'comments', 'Alex', 'often', 'people', 'take', 'control', 'When', 'Jake', 'mother', 'engagement', 'easy', 'see', 'where', 'began', 'descriptions', 'youth', 'only', 'further.Too', 'often', 'when', 'relationships', 'are', 'forged', 'so', 'are', 'roles', 'person', 'control', 'one', 'control', 'Alex', 'relationship', 'Jake', 'was', 'unable', 'change', 'balance', 'power', 'was', 'doubt', 'Jake', 'was', 'control', 'though', 'hardly', 'overbearing', 'what', 'saw', 'also', 'adoring', 'gentle', 'new', 'situation', 'Tom', 'hoped', 'have', 'situation', 'could', 'control', 'wanted', 'call', 'shots.This', 'did', 'not', 'work', 'out', 'way', 'hoped', 'would', 'Alex', 'realized', 'situation', 'Tom', 'was', 'not', 'was', 'problem', 'when', 'balance', 'power', 'began', 'shift', 'ending', 'was', 'inevitable', 'only', 'time', 'could', 'exercise', 'control', 'not', 'lose', 'it.Jake', 'finding', 'diaries', 'reading', 'out', 'Tom', 'understand', 'why', 'travesty', 'basketball', 'challenge', 'interruption', 'well', 'meaning', 'friends', 'one-on-one', 'match', 'one', 'sided', 'conversation', 'where', 'Jake', 'tears', 'Tom', 'philosophies', 'life', 'seeing', 'only', 'philandering', 'man', 'not', 'quot', 'cheerleaders', 'quot', 'may', 'have', 'gotten', 'different', 'answers', 'Needless', 'say', 'Jake', 'know', 'what', 'Alex', 'saw', 'Tom', 'also', 'Tom', 'interest', 'Alex.Tom', 'unaware', 'Jake', 'was', 'Alex', 'fiance', 'Tom', 'also', 'unaware', 'Alex', 'dead', 'scene', 'later', 'scene', 'where', 'Jake', 'Tom', 'death', 'Alex', 'presenting', 'red', 'shoes', 'Alex', 'bought', 'well', 'done', 'example', 'possessiveness', 'grief', 'men', 'wonder', 'Jake', 'more', 'upset', 'Alex', 'death', 'Tom', 'owned', 'part', 'Jake', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'Similarily', 'Tom', 'reacts.I', 'found', 'movie', 'had', 'interesting', 'insight', 'why', 'people', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'character', 'Jake', 'Tom', 'never', 'get', 'point', 'Especially', 'when', 'apparent', 'Jake', 'seek', 'answers', 'even', 'being', 'given', 'Alex', 'diary', 'also', 'see', 'how', 'things', 'can', 'go', 'horribly', 'wrong', 'look', 'outside', 'must', 'look', 'inside', 'Easy', 'say', 'not', 'so', 'easy', 'do.Given', 'nature', 'other', 'follow', 'ons', 'movie', 'seem', 'pure', 'erotica', 'may', 'not', 'see', ""'m"", 'sure', 'glad', 'saw', 'one', 'Please', 'note', 'saw', 'rated', 'R', 'version', ""'m"", 'not', 'prude', 'have', 'story', 'movie', ""'m"", 'going', 'dedicate', '2', 'hours']",N/A

She became involved with a blue collard worker, with a bad boy image; played by: Billy Wirth. The soft erotic sex scenes between Brigitte Bako and Billy Wirth, speaks for its self. She was torn between the bad boy who stimulated her sexually, and emotionally, and the white collard highly successful boyfriend. Her confusion became so overwhelming for her, that the bad boy who sold her the red pumps was her obsession; she wrote in her diary. David Duchovny responded to her writings, and acted out his frustrations when he decided to pay the bad boy a visit; challenging him to a basketball game.

If you've ever seen that series, this movie lays down the groundwork of the character in the series played by David Duchovny.  If you haven't seen the series, it centers around his character who receives all the erotic letters (which are turned into visual mini stories) from women after placing an ad in the classifieds attempting to understand why his fiance ended her life.The movie centers on the relationship of David's character with his fiance, and while they have an active sex life, her character wonders if there's something missing from her 'perfect life'.  Which sends on her path of searching of something she can't exactly put her finger...and into the arms of Billy Wirth's character (who btw is intensely hot in this film) and into his bed.But she struggles between the perfectness of her life with David's character, and the craving intensity she feels with Billy's character... ultimately sending her on a emotional spiral downward..where she ends her own life.Then David's character sets out trying to discover what happened, when he finds her journal, and vows to find out who this other man is.  With a climactic scene where they both meet and confront each other.While there is no perfect ending in this movie, it does contain some fantastic sex scenes, and some intensely passionate characters filled with emotional baggage.  Very visually interesting as well.If you're new to Zalman King's work, and you enjoy this movie, you might check out his other works (Red Shoe Diaries the series, Lake Consequence).",5,"Hot and seductive, Smokin'",1224288000,"10 18, 2008",2008,1786,"['Bottom', 'Line', 'Buy', 'ItI', 'have', 'say', 'Zalman', 'King', 'pretty', 'excellent', 'work', 'bringing', 'heat', 'screen', 'movies', 'tv', 'programs.This', 'movie', 'was', 'turned', 'TV', 'series', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'Diaries', 'originally', 'aired', 'Showtime', '1990', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'series', 'movie', 'groundwork', 'character', 'series', 'played', 'David', 'Duchovny', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', 'character', 'who', 'erotic', 'letters', 'are', 'turned', 'visual', 'mini', 'stories', 'women', 'placing', 'ad', 'classifieds', 'attempting', 'understand', 'why', 'fiance', 'ended', 'life.The', 'movie', 'centers', 'relationship', 'David', 'character', 'fiance', 'have', 'active', 'sex', 'life', 'character', 'wonders', 'something', 'missing', ""'perfect"", 'life', 'Which', 'path', 'searching', 'something', 'ca', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'put', 'finger', 'arms', 'Billy', 'Wirth', 'character', 'who', 'btw', 'intensely', 'hot', 'film', 'bed.But', 'perfectness', 'life', 'David', 'character', 'craving', 'intensity', 'Billy', 'character', 'ultimately', 'sending', 'emotional', 'spiral', 'downward..where', 'own', 'life.Then', 'David', 'character', 'out', 'trying', 'discover', 'what', 'happened', 'when', 'journal', 'vows', 'find', 'out', 'who', 'other', 'man', 'climactic', 'scene', 'where', 'meet', 'confront', 'other.While', 'perfect', 'ending', 'movie', 'contain', 'fantastic', 'sex', 'scenes', 'intensely', 'passionate', 'characters', 'filled', 'emotional', 'baggage', 'Very', 'visually', 'interesting', 'well.If', ""'re"", 'new', 'Zalman', 'King', 'work', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'might', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'works', 'Red', 'Shoe', 'series', 'Lake', 'Consequence']",N/A
