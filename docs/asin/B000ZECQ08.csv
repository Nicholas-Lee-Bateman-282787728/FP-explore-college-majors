1121926,A1ALOIPRR8Q06J,B000ZECQ08,"2 cents ""meaningless memes""","[6, 10]","They left too much out. Period. And their editing sucks because movies aren't supposed to *feel* too long. I haven't read the book and I watched this thing drag on and on and felt bored. Bored! There is this incredible world of magic, brought to life with dazzling special effects, great costumes, compelling characters and actors with genuine chemistry. And so yeah there IS that! So thumbs-up on all that! But it was like watching half of a story unfold with crucial information and contexts edited out to make room for teenage drama. It is exactly like hearing a great story but you missed a few crucial parts and so it falls flat, and the person telling the story isn't a great story teller...And it reminds of somebody who is, in this case of Harry Potter, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n who made the most cinematic film of the series. Yes the movie version must necessarily leave out somethings, but it is the job of the writer and director to get what is essential in there while not bogging things heavily down too much. Since David Yates was chosen to do the last book, I hold out little hope, but at least they did the smart thing, giving that book two movies. Maybe that will save the day?I guess they think everybody has read the books, but that seems like it would make it worse for those that have. You know every detail that skipped!I really have enjoyed the *film* series. I'm not a reader of the books, which undoubtedly strikes you as absurd and wrong (so I'm already aware you probably strongly feel that way, so spare me. I do read books.)The director and screen writers have dragged this adventure series down and zapped it of it's excitement. It is NOT because the books are darker.

I like that the pack comes in all the flavors of video, and thank goodness:  We only have one blu-ray player and HDTV (in the living room), my wife and daughter watch their movies in SD (DVD) in the bedroom, and I watch on the computer.  I also enjoyed some of the extras that came with this set.  I liked the additional scenes, and the lightning-round Q&A; with the cast and crew.  There are also exclusive features for blu-ray viewers, if you have a BD-live enabled player.  I am also looking forward to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando (sneak peek in this set).""A boy who grew up in a cupboard, not knowing he is a wizard, destined to fight the most evil wizard of all time.""Having not seen the movie when it came out in the theaters, I was pleasantly surprised with how the movie was put together.  The characters are all coming of age, and henceforth so must the plot.  The movie starts with Harry getting a date with a muggle waitress, while the rest of the characters similarly suffer teenage hormonal rage and sexual tension.  Oh, and they also do magic, battle bad wizards, and plot a way to destroy the evil Lord Voldemort.  If you expect it to be just like the book, be prepared for the disappointment.  However, if you keep an open mind and understand the director's/writer's prerogative, then the movie will surely be a pleasure to watch.  It is a great feel-good movie, but you sort of have to know the entire saga to understand this.  One can see that as the series progressed, so did the dark theme.  This movie is quite gothic, and drips of doom.My disappointment is in the lag time between the books and the movies.  This movie has drained much of the urgency from the screen adaptation, which seemed to have come across as an afterthought, significantly more so than the previous films.  This is the source of the missing star on the rating.For the time being, I will not review the movie plot since there are tons of movie reviews for HP 6 and the Half Blood Prince.A strong 4 out of 5 stars (not fully earning the 5 star rating).",4,A review of both the movie and the DVD set,1260144000,"12 7, 2009",2009,2273,"['review', 'theHarry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'Blu-ray/DVD', 'Combo', '+', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'BD-Live', 'Blu-ray', ']', 'combo', 'pack', 'Blu-Ray', 'movie', 'DVD', 'movie', 'Digital', 'Copy', 'like', 'pack', 'flavors', 'video', 'thank', 'goodness', 'only', 'have', 'one', 'blu-ray', 'player', 'HDTV', 'living', 'room', 'wife', 'daughter', 'watch', 'movies', 'SD', 'DVD', 'bedroom', 'watch', 'computer', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'extras', 'came', 'set', 'liked', 'additional', 'scenes', 'lightning-round', 'Q', 'A', 'cast', 'crew', 'are', 'also', 'exclusive', 'features', 'blu-ray', 'viewers', 'have', 'BD-live', 'enabled', 'player', 'am', 'also', 'looking', 'forward', 'Wizarding', 'World', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Universal', 'Orlando', 'sneak', 'peek', 'set', 'A', 'boy', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'cupboard', 'not', 'knowing', 'wizard', 'destined', 'fight', 'most', 'evil', 'wizard', 'time', 'Having', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'when', 'came', 'out', 'theaters', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'put', 'together', 'characters', 'are', 'coming', 'age', 'henceforth', 'so', 'must', 'plot', 'movie', 'Harry', 'getting', 'date', 'muggle', 'waitress', 'rest', 'characters', 'similarly', 'suffer', 'teenage', 'hormonal', 'rage', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Oh', 'also', 'do', 'magic', 'battle', 'bad', 'wizards', 'plot', 'way', 'destroy', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'expect', 'be', 'just', 'book', 'be', 'prepared', 'disappointment', 'However', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'understand', ""director's/writer"", 'prerogative', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'surely', 'be', 'pleasure', 'watch', 'great', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'sort', 'have', 'know', 'entire', 'saga', 'understand', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'series', 'progressed', 'so', 'did', 'dark', 'theme', 'movie', 'quite', 'gothic', 'drips', 'doom.My', 'disappointment', 'lag', 'time', 'books', 'movies', 'movie', 'drained', 'much', 'urgency', 'screen', 'adaptation', 'seemed', 'have', 'come', 'across', 'afterthought', 'significantly', 'more', 'so', 'previous', 'films', 'source', 'missing', 'star', 'rating.For', 'time', 'being', 'will', 'not', 'review', 'movie', 'plot', 'are', 'tons', 'movie', 'reviews', 'HP', '6', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince.A', 'strong', '4', '5', 'stars', 'not', 'fully', 'earning', '5', 'star', 'rating']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The return of series scribe Steve Kloves seems to have made a big difference, because this movie does a great job of keeping all of the complex character interplay intact even as large chunks of plot are lost along the way. These characters felt like the characters I'd read in the books, and I care a lot more about that than having every scene from the book reproduced, however fleetingly. This is probably the least action-heavy of the movies so far, but if you don't care about the characters by now, why are you still watching?The cinematography for the film went through a belaboured process. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel originally intended a very dark, very monochrome -- almost black and white -- look for the film. After seeing how far in that direction Delbonnel had gone, they panicked and ordered the unique look scaled back, with the color saturation boosted back up considerably. The result is a beautiful looking film, but NOT a natural looking film. The picture remains very dark, with a lot of detail lost to the shadows that there's no way of getting back. The midranges are anemic, because there simply wasn't that much detail to bring back in the first place. This is how the film looked in theaters and is NOT a fault of the Blu-ray presentation. It's how the movie's supposed to look, even if that look isn't everyone's cup of tea.",5,Second best film of the series so far -- excellent transfer for difficult cinematography,1280102400,"07 26, 2010",2010,1625,"['was', 'not', 'fan', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'adaptation', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'disjointed', 'mess', 'got', 'neither', 'feel', 'substance', 'book', 'correct', 'was', 'not', 'optimistic', 'sixth', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'return', 'series', 'scribe', 'Steve', 'have', 'made', 'big', 'difference', 'movie', 'great', 'job', 'keeping', 'complex', 'character', 'interplay', 'intact', 'even', 'large', 'chunks', 'plot', 'are', 'lost', 'way', 'characters', 'felt', 'characters', ""'d"", 'read', 'books', 'care', 'lot', 'more', 'having', 'scene', 'book', 'reproduced', 'however', 'fleetingly', 'probably', 'least', 'action-heavy', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'characters', 'now', 'why', 'are', 'still', 'watching', 'cinematography', 'film', 'went', 'belaboured', 'process', 'Cinematographer', 'Bruno', 'Delbonnel', 'originally', 'intended', 'very', 'dark', 'very', 'monochrome', 'almost', 'black', 'white', 'look', 'film', 'seeing', 'how', 'far', 'direction', 'Delbonnel', 'had', 'gone', 'panicked', 'ordered', 'unique', 'look', 'scaled', 'back', 'color', 'saturation', 'boosted', 'back', 'up', 'considerably', 'result', 'beautiful', 'looking', 'film', 'NOT', 'natural', 'looking', 'film', 'picture', 'very', 'dark', 'lot', 'detail', 'lost', 'shadows', 'way', 'getting', 'back', 'midranges', 'are', 'anemic', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'much', 'detail', 'bring', 'back', 'first', 'place', 'how', 'film', 'looked', 'theaters', 'NOT', 'fault', 'Blu-ray', 'presentation', 'how', 'movie', 'supposed', 'look', 'even', 'look', ""n't"", 'everyone', 'cup', 'tea']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I've been asking myself that same question for the past six years.Short attention span summary (SASS):1. Dark times are at hand for both wizards and muggles, as the Death Eaters wreak a destructive path across both worlds.2. Draco has a special assignment from you-know-who, which has his mum distressed enough to seek a bodyguard for him.3.  Hogwarts turns into hormone central as teenagers start getting googly-eyed, and sometimes enlist magical assistance in matters of the heart.4. Quidditch is always good entertainment, and so is a little walk down memory lane, a hunt for a dark treasure and a dramatic ending.5. Still not enough Bellatrix Lestrange (the always amazing Helena Bonham Carter) - MORE MORE!!!This is a rather good interpretation of a book that was largely about young love at Hogwarts (except of course for the ending), and although it was long, it held the interest painlessly.  I never expected much from this one, seeing as it isn't much more than a scene setter for the two grand finales, and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was.The young actors have settled down well in their roles, and the rest of the cast fit as comfortably as always.  Jim Broadbent makes a perfect Horace Slughorn, and Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter and Dame Maggie Smith (albeit in a small role this time) continue to excel.  Kudos also to Bonnie Wright who plays Ginny Weasley, a character that has finally come into her own on screen.Highly recommended for all Potter fans, even if only to get your fix before the next movie.Albus Dumbledore: You must be wondering why I brought you here.Harry Potter: Actually Sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.Amanda Richards, August 17, 2009",4,"""Oh, to be young and to feel love's keen sting.""",1250467200,"08 17, 2009",2009,1868,"['Professor', 'Minerva', 'McGonagall', '[', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', ']', 'Why', 'whenever', 'anything', 'always', 'three', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Believe', 'Professor', ""'ve"", 'been', 'asking', 'same', 'question', 'past', 'six', 'years.Short', 'attention', 'span', 'summary', 'SASS', ':1', 'Dark', 'times', 'are', 'hand', 'wizards', 'muggles', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'wreak', 'destructive', 'path', 'worlds.2', 'Draco', 'special', 'assignment', 'you-know-who', 'mum', 'distressed', 'enough', 'seek', 'bodyguard', 'him.3', 'hormone', 'central', 'teenagers', 'start', 'getting', 'googly-eyed', 'sometimes', 'enlist', 'magical', 'assistance', 'matters', 'heart.4', 'Quidditch', 'always', 'good', 'entertainment', 'so', 'little', 'walk', 'memory', 'lane', 'hunt', 'dark', 'treasure', 'dramatic', 'ending.5', 'Still', 'not', 'enough', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'always', 'amazing', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'MORE', 'MORE', 'rather', 'good', 'interpretation', 'book', 'was', 'largely', 'young', 'love', 'Hogwarts', 'course', 'ending', 'was', 'long', 'held', 'interest', 'painlessly', 'never', 'expected', 'much', 'one', 'seeing', ""n't"", 'much', 'more', 'scene', 'setter', 'two', 'grand', 'finales', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'how', 'good', 'young', 'actors', 'have', 'settled', 'down', 'well', 'roles', 'rest', 'cast', 'fit', 'as', 'comfortably', 'always', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'perfect', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'small', 'role', 'time', 'continue', 'excel', 'Kudos', 'also', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'who', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'character', 'finally', 'come', 'own', 'screen.Highly', 'recommended', 'Potter', 'fans', 'even', 'only', 'get', 'fix', 'next', 'movie.Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'must', 'be', 'wondering', 'why', 'brought', 'here.Harry', 'Potter', 'Actually', 'Sir', 'years', 'just', 'sort', 'go', 'it.Amanda', 'Richards', 'August', '17', '2009']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

All the charm, wit, and inventiveness of the early films seems to have been lost, and now the focus is just on the struggle with Voldemort, which is really not very engaging.  In the early films, it just gave the characters something to do while we got to know them and their world.  Now it's nearly all there is.

1121950,AQZKKNNG6GWKV,B000ZECQ08,Andrew Kutz,"[6, 15]","When one waits 16 hours in a line to ensure they get good seats to a movie, it'll have to be one darn good film that they are seeing to make it worth it. I can say without a shadow of a doubt that `Half-Blood Prince,' the latest installment in the insanely popular Harry Potter franchise, is one darn good movie and would have been worth another six hours at least.A long time has passed since Harry and Co. sat around the Great Hall and played wizard chess while worrying about their exams.  As year six dawns for our young heroes, everything, including their beloved Hogwarts, has a dark and menacing existence. Even the muggles are beginning to feel the effects of the rising evil in the wizarding world.And so begins Year 6.`Half-Blood Prince' is, despite the times, far and away the funniest of the Potter films.  The excellent writing is sharp, and downright hilarious at times. Steve Kloves really did a wonderful job of balancing the screenplay with a perfect combination of wit and storytelling, the end result being a film that is perfectly paced with not a dull moment to speak of. Superb writing.The acting is, across the board, near-perfect. The three young stars all shine in their respective rolls. Daniel Radcliffe plays well the reluctant yet determined hero. He also shows his comedic side in an insanely memorable scene featuring Felix Felicius, liquid luck. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, despite not playing as large a roll as Radcliffe, are also excellent. Grint's dead nuts tone and facial expressions absolutely make the awkward romances that permeate the story.  A run in with a love potion gives Grint an opportunity to prove his comedic talents, and, boy, does he deliver.  Watson, on the other hand, is possibly the most improved and probably the best.  She has gotten her eyebrows under control for this one and is charming as Hermione.  While hers is a more serious role, she comes through brilliantly as well, especially in an emotional scene in which she is very convincing.Also, the supporting cast is phenomenal.  Michael Gambon is excellent as Dumbledore, and Jim Broadbent proves a worthy addition to the cast as Professor Slughorn, a professor returning to teach at Hogwarts.  Bonnie Wright, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, and Helena Bonham-Carter round off the wonderful cast. Special mention to Tom Felton, who steps up to a larger role as the conflicted Draco Malfoy and does a superb job.By the time you near the end of this movie, you may have trouble believing how it will end. Sure, through the laughs, you learn bits and pieces of the dark and mysterious past of Voldemort, but so far it has not been extremely heavy. Then comes the last half hour, which is perhaps the best part of the film. As Harry and Dumbledore travel to a dark cave in search of a missing piece of Voldemort's past, the tone of the whole film changes dramatically.  This change is handled perfectly, and catapults the viewers to the shocking and ultimately sobering end.I will admit, it has been a while since I read the novel upon which this film is based. That said, I cannot vouch completely for the quality of the adaption. I can, however, think of several things that were added or taken away, right off the top of my head. Unlike with some of the films, however, these changes seem completely natural and irreprehensible.  I felt that the changes were handled well and for the bettering of the film and the franchise. To watch it without comparing it strictly to the book is how, ultimately, this film will be enjoyed fully.One such change, at the end, is a funeral that has been removed from the film.  In it's place, however, is a wonderful sentiment by the teachers and students of Hogwarts that is an extremely emotional and a stirring symbolism. Just as the end of the book, it brought tears to my eyes. While it was different from the book, it was still extremely effective, and brought the heart of the novel to the screen.The very last scene, in which Harry, Ron and Hermione discuss what will happen going forward, speaks to them as well as the audience. Nothing will be the same. They know that everything they have done to this point has been leading up to an epic climax that will decide the fate of the world. Just so, the audience not only sees, but FEELS the epic battle that is looming. And as Harry aptly observes of the school that will never be the same: ""I'm just beginning to realize how beautiful this is.""The same could be said of the Harry Potter franchise.",5,Simply Excellent,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,4501,"['When', 'one', '16', 'hours', 'line', 'ensure', 'get', 'good', 'seats', 'movie', ""'ll"", 'have', 'be', 'one', 'darn', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'seeing', 'make', 'can', 'say', 'shadow', 'doubt', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'latest', 'installment', 'insanely', 'popular', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'one', 'darn', 'good', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'worth', 'six', 'hours', 'least.A', 'long', 'time', 'passed', 'Harry', 'Co.', 'sat', 'Great', 'Hall', 'played', 'wizard', 'chess', 'worrying', 'exams', 'year', 'six', 'dawns', 'young', 'heroes', 'everything', 'including', 'beloved', 'Hogwarts', 'dark', 'menacing', 'existence', 'Even', 'muggles', 'are', 'beginning', 'feel', 'effects', 'rising', 'evil', 'wizarding', 'world.And', 'so', 'Year', '6.', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'times', 'far', 'away', 'funniest', 'Potter', 'films', 'excellent', 'writing', 'sharp', 'downright', 'hilarious', 'times', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'really', 'did', 'wonderful', 'job', 'balancing', 'screenplay', 'perfect', 'combination', 'wit', 'storytelling', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'film', 'perfectly', 'paced', 'not', 'dull', 'moment', 'speak', 'Superb', 'writing.The', 'acting', 'board', 'near-perfect', 'three', 'young', 'stars', 'shine', 'respective', 'rolls', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'well', 'reluctant', 'yet', 'determined', 'hero', 'also', 'comedic', 'side', 'insanely', 'memorable', 'scene', 'featuring', 'Felix', 'Felicius', 'liquid', 'luck', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'not', 'playing', 'large', 'roll', 'Radcliffe', 'are', 'also', 'excellent', 'Grint', 'dead', 'nuts', 'tone', 'facial', 'expressions', 'absolutely', 'make', 'awkward', 'permeate', 'story', 'run', 'love', 'potion', 'Grint', 'opportunity', 'prove', 'comedic', 'talents', 'boy', 'deliver', 'Watson', 'other', 'hand', 'possibly', 'most', 'improved', 'probably', 'best', 'gotten', 'eyebrows', 'control', 'one', 'charming', 'Hermione', 'hers', 'more', 'serious', 'role', 'through', 'brilliantly', 'as', 'well', 'especially', 'emotional', 'scene', 'very', 'convincing.Also', 'supporting', 'cast', 'phenomenal', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'excellent', 'Dumbledore', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'worthy', 'addition', 'cast', 'Professor', 'Slughorn', 'professor', 'returning', 'teach', 'Hogwarts', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Helena', 'Bonham-Carter', 'round', 'off', 'wonderful', 'cast', 'Special', 'mention', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'who', 'up', 'larger', 'role', 'conflicted', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'superb', 'job.By', 'time', 'end', 'movie', 'may', 'have', 'trouble', 'believing', 'how', 'will', 'end', 'Sure', 'laughs', 'learn', 'bits', 'pieces', 'dark', 'mysterious', 'past', 'Voldemort', 'so', 'far', 'not', 'been', 'extremely', 'heavy', 'Then', 'last', 'half', 'hour', 'perhaps', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'travel', 'dark', 'cave', 'search', 'missing', 'piece', 'Voldemort', 'past', 'tone', 'whole', 'film', 'changes', 'dramatically', 'change', 'handled', 'perfectly', 'viewers', 'shocking', 'ultimately', 'sobering', 'end.I', 'will', 'admit', 'been', 'while', 'read', 'novel', 'film', 'based', 'said', 'can', 'not', 'vouch', 'completely', 'quality', 'adaption', 'can', 'however', 'think', 'several', 'things', 'were', 'added', 'taken', 'away', 'right', 'off', 'top', 'head', 'films', 'however', 'changes', 'seem', 'completely', 'natural', 'irreprehensible', 'felt', 'changes', 'were', 'handled', 'well', 'bettering', 'film', 'franchise', 'watch', 'comparing', 'strictly', 'book', 'how', 'ultimately', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'fully.One', 'such', 'change', 'end', 'funeral', 'been', 'removed', 'film', 'place', 'however', 'wonderful', 'sentiment', 'teachers', 'students', 'Hogwarts', 'extremely', 'emotional', 'stirring', 'symbolism', 'Just', 'end', 'book', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'was', 'different', 'book', 'was', 'still', 'extremely', 'effective', 'brought', 'heart', 'novel', 'screen.The', 'very', 'last', 'scene', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'discuss', 'what', 'will', 'happen', 'going', 'forward', 'speaks', 'as', 'well', 'audience', 'Nothing', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'know', 'everything', 'have', 'done', 'point', 'been', 'leading', 'up', 'epic', 'climax', 'will', 'decide', 'fate', 'world', 'Just', 'so', 'audience', 'not', 'only', 'FEELS', 'epic', 'battle', 'looming', 'Harry', 'aptly', 'school', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'same', ""'m"", 'just', 'beginning', 'realize', 'how', 'beautiful', 'same', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'franchise']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1121953,A26O6MQFA36WBK,B000ZECQ08,A Reviewer,"[2, 2]","It's unfortunate that this ended up being such a disappointing installment in the series because at times it's so promising. Director David Yates definitely seems to have been the biggest fan of the books of any director who has made a HP movie, and this is incredibly well made. The amount of detail in here and the way this wizarding world is brought to life is pretty stunning. Half Blood Prince is the 4th shortest book of the series as well, which has given the filmmakers time to include almost all the major events of the book....almost. Then you get to the final act, which is as big an example of ""dropping the ball"" I think I've ever seen. But I'll get to that. Half Blood Prince was, in my opinion, one of the least-interesting books of the series. It featured tons and tons of flashbacks and aside from that, not all that much happening. It was loaded with teen romance and honestly I can't stand that stuff. I actually give the filmmakers credit for trimming a lot of this out. We got just the right amount of Voldemort flashbacks, we got ...still a little too much romance, but it was at least not as unbearably annoying as it was in the book. Where the book Half Blood Prince amazed, though, was its ending. The last few chapters were some of the most intense, powerful, and surprising in the entire series. And unfortunately, the filmmakers seemed to have butchered them at every opportunity. Just when scenes like the one inside the cave begin to get even remotely exciting, they abruptly cut away. The scene on top of the tower totally lacked the intensity it needed, and the performances of two key actors in this scene....what were they thinking? The confrontation down at the cabin, same thing....I don't understand what the filmmakers hoped to achieve with this scene as it was shot, but it doesn't make any sense, emotionally. The story's big reveal is then handled so casually (and with no explanation whatsoever) that it's almost laughable.A main character does die in this film, and the amount of weight this is given is almost mindbogglingly small.

Rodriguez ""Kapuffy""","[0, 0]","I am a really big fan of the Harry Potter books as well as the films, and I must say that--although Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite film--it was an incredible film. To this day, Prisoner of Azkaban remains the strongest piece of filmmaking in the series; but this one closely follows. For those who gave this film a negative review, I can sympathize; but people have to realize what it entails to make a film. It will never be the book. Of course, the first few films followed their stories quite accurately, but the size of the book has played a huge role. As the books have become progressively bigger, it has become more of a challenge for the filmmakers to adapt the story. I think Yates and Steve Kloves did an exceptional job adapting this book. The scenes that needed to be left in, were, and the ones that weren't were chopped off. Many people have complained that the film was boring, but I do not think that has anything to do with how the movie was made. If the movie followed the book, word for word, people still would have had the same complaint. If you're looking for the thrills and adventure that you got in Goblet of Fire, you won't find it here; this film has more of a narrowly-focused plot, whereas in GOF, there seemed to be too much going on for one film. Here, in HBP, Yates chooses to focus on and play up the relationships (since they will be essential for the last film); he touches on certain aspects of Voldemort's past that give clear enough evidence of his origins and why he turned out the way he did; and he builds up an obvious tension for a climax that will inevitably occur in the last film. Not only does Yates deliver a more subtle film, but he delivers one of the best looking films in the series. The visual tone and cinematography of this film are top-notch, and cannot be compared to any of the other films, except Prisoner of Azkaban.Give this movie a chance and appreciate it in its own terms. If possible, don't step into it prepared to compare it to the book, because chances are you will be disappointed. Additionally, don't think it will be like Goblet of Fire; the book wasn't even like Goblet of Fire. Many people I know seem to put all the films on a scale with Goblet of Fire, but Goblet of Fire worked more on an action level on par with films such as Transformers and Spider-Man. These stories, as they progress, become more focused on a universal and political dilemma: that Voldemort has returned; and the relationships, because of it, are enhanced and exhibited more fluently. Yes, the films become more dialogue-driven and less colorful; but so do the books. In changing the tone and pacing of the movie, the audience is allowed to witness the threat Voldemort poses in the Wizarding World.Let this movie take you in; it's an amazing work of art and filmmaking.",5,Great Film!,1266796800,"02 22, 2010",2010,2825,"['am', 'really', 'big', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'as', 'well', 'films', 'must', 'say', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'was', 'not', 'favorite', 'film', 'was', 'incredible', 'film', 'day', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'strongest', 'piece', 'filmmaking', 'series', 'one', 'closely', 'who', 'gave', 'film', 'negative', 'review', 'can', 'sympathize', 'people', 'have', 'realize', 'what', 'make', 'film', 'will', 'never', 'be', 'book', 'course', 'first', 'few', 'films', 'followed', 'stories', 'quite', 'accurately', 'size', 'book', 'played', 'huge', 'role', 'books', 'have', 'become', 'progressively', 'bigger', 'become', 'more', 'challenge', 'filmmakers', 'adapt', 'story', 'think', 'Yates', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'did', 'exceptional', 'job', 'adapting', 'book', 'scenes', 'needed', 'be', 'left', 'were', 'ones', 'were', ""n't"", 'were', 'chopped', 'off', 'Many', 'people', 'have', 'complained', 'film', 'was', 'boring', 'do', 'not', 'think', 'anything', 'do', 'how', 'movie', 'was', 'made', 'movie', 'followed', 'book', 'word', 'word', 'people', 'still', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'same', 'complaint', ""'re"", 'looking', 'thrills', 'adventure', 'got', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'wo', ""n't"", 'find', 'here', 'film', 'more', 'narrowly-focused', 'plot', 'whereas', 'GOF', 'seemed', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'going', 'one', 'film', 'Here', 'HBP', 'chooses', 'focus', 'play', 'up', 'relationships', 'will', 'be', 'essential', 'last', 'film', 'certain', 'aspects', 'Voldemort', 'past', 'give', 'clear', 'enough', 'evidence', 'origins', 'why', 'turned', 'out', 'way', 'did', 'up', 'obvious', 'tension', 'climax', 'will', 'inevitably', 'occur', 'last', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'Yates', 'deliver', 'more', 'subtle', 'film', 'one', 'best', 'looking', 'films', 'series', 'visual', 'tone', 'cinematography', 'film', 'are', 'top-notch', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'compared', 'other', 'films', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban.Give', 'movie', 'chance', 'appreciate', 'own', 'terms', 'possible', 'do', ""n't"", 'step', 'prepared', 'compare', 'book', 'chances', 'are', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'Additionally', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'will', 'be', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'book', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'like', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Many', 'people', 'know', 'seem', 'put', 'films', 'scale', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'worked', 'more', 'action', 'level', 'par', 'films', 'such', 'Transformers', 'Spider-Man', 'stories', 'progress', 'become', 'more', 'focused', 'universal', 'political', 'dilemma', 'Voldemort', 'returned', 'relationships', 'are', 'enhanced', 'exhibited', 'more', 'fluently', 'Yes', 'films', 'become', 'more', 'dialogue-driven', 'less', 'colorful', 'so', 'do', 'books', 'changing', 'tone', 'pacing', 'movie', 'audience', 'allowed', 'witness', 'threat', 'Voldemort', 'Wizarding', 'World.Let', 'movie', 'take', 'amazing', 'work', 'art', 'filmmaking']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

It's darker, although perhaps not darker than the Order of the Phoenix. It's also more involved with the personal lives of our main characters. Oddly, though, the kids have grown up so much that I can't be sure which ones are or are not being played by different actors. Not the main characters, certainly: but is Lavender Brown the same? Neville and Luna may or may not be: they are seen so briefly.Anyway, the basic story is that the Death Eaters are causing a lot of trouble, even in the muggle world, and Dumbledore seems to have a plan to fight back, although the nature of the fight takes some time to develop. Even for him.He has asked Horace Slughorn to come out of retirement and be the Potions master, while Severus Snape finally gets the position he has wanted all along: Defense Against the Dark Arts. Why? It turns out Tom Riddle was a favorite of Slughorn's when he was at Hogwarts, and Dumbledore is convinced he has vital information about Riddle. You see, Slughorn is a sort of name-dropping groupie of famous witches and wizards and their children. As Dumbledore puts it, he likes to ""collect"" names for his Slug Club. Of course he wants to collect Harry, and Dumbledore asks Harry to get close to him in the hopes of getting the necessary information. Dumbledore has a bottled memory of Slughorn talking to Tom Riddle, but it has been altered. (You know about the bottled memories; they are put into the pensieve in order to be experienced.) It is Harry's mission to get the truth from Slughorn.Harry succeeds. It turns out Slughorn told Riddle about horcruxes, very dark magic that allows a magician to divide part of his soul and hide it in an object. So if he is killed, it's just that body that dies; he can still recover the hidden part of his soul from the horcrux. Making just one is bad enough, but apparently Voldemort made seven of them. Potter destroyed one, Riddle's diary, in the Chamber of Secrets. Dumbledore found and destroyed a ring which had been in the family of Riddle's mother for some time, and it blackened his hand in the process.Now he believes he knows where another is hidden: in a cave by the ocean where he takes Harry with him, first extracting a promise from Harry that he will do as Dumbledore asks, no matter what. Harry promises, but it turns out to be pretty horrible to live up to. And even more horrible is what they confront when they return to Hogwarts.I've told you too much already, especially if you haven't read the books. But believe me, there's a great deal more.

1121965,A2582KMXLK2P06,B000ZECQ08,B. E Jackson,"[3, 5]","I agree that Half-Blood Prince is by FAR the most boring film in the entire Harry Potter series.  This is because the entire film has a very quiet and uninteresting storyline, a noticeably dull atmosphere, and a familiarity that's getting quite annoying by this point, to be totally honest.  Almost like they're milking the Harry Potter series for all it's worth.  A movie like this makes such a theory seem VERY likely.In addition to the movie just being boring to watch (among other problems) the majority of the film has a ""been there, done that"" feel to it.  The walking footsteps that appear whenever Harry Potter opens up a map?  Been there, done that.  The images of people moving inside the picture frames?  Yes, we've seen that several times by this point, and yes, at one point it was really cool to witness but now it's just repeating the same old formula that made the Harry Potter series successful in the first place.  The famous broom game?  Yes, it's here (though only seen in brief moments).Another annoying aspect of Half-Blood Prince is the way Harry Potter and his friends carry on the most pointless conversations imaginable concerning girlfriends and friendships.  The entire first half of the film deals with this, and it's really totally unnecessary.  We're talking about an hour and a half of this specific storyline.  NOT good.Also, there's hardly any special magical effects that involve Harry Potter and his friends casting bizarre spells. This means the adventure and fun has been almost completely sucked out of it.  Furthermore, there's no really big dramatic finish involving Harry battling some exciting and dangerous creature.  Nope, none of that takes place.To give one example, Harry and friends stumble upon a huge tarantula.  Instead of something neat taking place possibly involving Harry's magical long list of spells bringing the creature to life, it's just a boring conversation between all the characters and a howling dog.  Incredibly dull.I shouldn't have to read the books either because I've been following along to the movie series the entire time.  If I have to read the books, that means the movie writers didn't do their job in delivering a satisfying storyline.You also have to understand that since I've been following the Harry Potter movie series since the very beginning, it makes perfect sense that I should expect a dramatic and exciting conclusion out of each movie in the series because that's the successful formula they've been using.This film is a really big letdown, and I think it's time for the series to stop for good.

Oh they left this out! Oh they left that out! It's the same sorry grumbling time after time. And I wish it would stop. The mediums (literary and theatrical) are not 100% compatible. Period. It will NEVER, EVER happen. This movie alone was 153 minutes long, right in line with the rest of the series in terms of length. But this one stands out quite a bit compared to the others for a couple of reasons...The first is that this is a mature story. As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), Hermoine (Emma Watson,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) and Ron (Rupert Grint,Driving Lessons) continue their natural physical growth, so does the story. With age comes interest in the opposite sex, increasing responsibilities, and increased danger. It is this last one that stands out for the film, too. Dangerous and dark, this story is the most muted in terms of fun that any of us have seen so far. Director David Yates (The Girl in the Cafe) pulls off a stunningly stark and surreal landscape that has altered Hogswart from a place of fun and learning, to one of deception and dread.The second reason this one stands out is that it never spoonfeeds the viewer. If you don't know what something means, or where you're at, or why someone is interested in someone else, well, you're outta luck. But the connections within the film, if you pay attention, will give you all the answers. I applaud screenwriter Steve Kloves for stepping up and giving us an adult fantasy story that, at times, can make you squirm in your seat or jump out of it. I was actually surprised that the film retained a cool PG rating instead of PG-13.The third reason this film works is that it touches on relationships in a hard way. Fomenting strong bonds with each other, and sticking to them, is not something that is normal in society, and we see the fraying of friendships as they mutate, and watch how death can affect even the sturdiest of hearts.HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE outstrips all the other Harry Potter films for these very important reasons.

It's now very apparent that these three have no real future as adult actors.I spent most of the movie gritting my teeth over the horrendous miscasting of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. I can't believe that they couldn't find anyone who was closer to the style and demeanor of the late Richard Harris. Gambon, who was quoted as saying, ""I just play me"" appears incoherent and senile and apparently doesn't know that no one is really interested in watching him play himself. I suspect that Rowling killed Dumbledore off in the books because it was the only way to get rid of Gambon.

Some make a certain kind of sense, not having the Hogwarts battle in this movie, saving it for the great finale in the last book (movie) and perhaps that is why they added the Burrows fight.  I didn't really mind the Burrows fight for that reason, since it was consistent with the tone of the book, but allowed the BIG Hogwart's fight that is coming to (perhaps) have more of an impact.Others have detailed the other horrid omissions, so I won't recap them all here.  One that REALLY bugged me was not having the Snape, ""DON'T CALL ME A COWARD!""

Instead, the book details a whole host of events that seem intended to tie up loose ends and set the stage for the final one.

1121997,A2PBV1899CX3TE,B000ZECQ08,"C. CRADDOCK ""Cr@$#!!!!""","[9, 18]","Since I have never seen a Harry Potter film before, nor read any of the books, I had to agree with Harry Potter when he said to Albus Dumbledore: ""...after all these years I just sort of go with it."" I have four nieces and they are all followers of the Potter phenomenon. They had t-shirts made with their own Potter references and slogans, and wore them to the midnight show opening. One of them went down to wait in line at 6 PM so that we could all get good seats. She was the most passionate Potterite among them and had been interviewed at past openings by the local news wearing a Hogwarts uniform.So it was that I found myself at a midnight show. The crowd was very excited to see the opening, and I was swept up in the excitement, even though I didn't have a clue about the finer points of the J.K. Rowling story. You could say that it wasn't my bailiwick, and I was eminently unqualified to review this movie, but nevertheless, I came, I saw, and I can't resist weighing in with my two cents..My first observation was that the audience was mostly the same age as the actors playing Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), so they had been growing up with them, and were kind of in sync. They were ALL young and feeling love's keen sting, as Professor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) so aptly put it. In fact there was so much snogging going on, it was hard to fit in the horcruxes, Death Eaters, and the Quidditch match. I would not be surprised at all if the climax of the entire series revolves around who took who to the Hogswart prom. In fact, if I am not mistaken, there was some kind of prom or dance in Half-blood Prince, and Harry asked the most unlikely of dates, Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to attend.While we are on the subject, according to my sister the relationship between Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger was much better established in the book. She had more motivation for liking Ron in the book, but on screen, we're not buying it. Why aren't Harry Potter and Hermione Granger getting together? Actually, Emma Watson is out of BOTH Harry and Ron's league. They are like the chubby fanboy who tried to give Megan Fox the yellow rose and was completely ignored. She is like the girl next door who overnight morphs into a Super Model. Harry does kiss someone in the latest installment, and I would say who, but I don't want to spoil it. The kiss is a big deal, even overshadowing the death of a main character -- again, I won't say who, but we know it's not Harry Potter, although, Harry might feel a little guilt about standing by and not doing anything.Enough, already. I am starting to ramble. The next thing I would like to talk about is the villains. Draco Malvoy (Tom Felton) makes a pretty menacing villain, with his hair so blonde it is almost white. Lord Voldemort is not seen at all, but somehow his presence was felt. Kind of think that this movie is just a set up for the movies to come. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. They do have scenes of Voldemort as a boy, Tom Riddle at 11, and he is played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin. He takes that kind of creepy look that Draco has and raises it to the nth magnitude. Our young anti-hero, Hero Fiennes-Tiffin is related to Ralph Fiennes, who plays Voldemort, but he was not only cast because he resembled his Uncle Ralph, he also had that deep and dark look that hinted of the evil to come...------------------Harry Potter: Did you know, sir? Then?Albus Dumbledore: Did I know that I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time? No.===============================Anyway, seeing a Harry Potter movie for the first time, it is easy to see why so many love them. I think the audience may have been split between those who want the films to be exactly like the book, and those who don't mind the film going in a different direction than the book if it could make for a better movie. J.K. Rowling has endorsed the second approach, although she would intervene if the movie veers too far away. For instance, when the script had Dumbledore remembering an episode from his past where he loved a girl, J.K. stepped in and said that could NEVER happen because... well, you'll just have to watch and find out, won't you?There is a third group, and that is my group, the people who don't care if it follows the book or not, because they haven't read the books. Just looking at it as a movie, without any preconceptions, I would say that there are great special effects and art direction. They really create a world and inhabit it with strange creatures that look right at home. I can see that these movies make a lot of money, and they really go all out, pumping the profits back into the products. The Potter movie I saw was really a great example of movie making craft at its finest. I think the fans will like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, even if the ending is kind of anticlimactic. It is not the final showdown, but just setting the audience up for the battles to come.-------------------Albus Dumbledore: You must be wondering why I brought you here.Harry Potter: Actually sir, after all these years I just sort of go with it.==============================Art School Confidential(2006) ....

1121998,AQKKQ6L7Q9YJS,B000ZECQ08,ChaCha,"[12, 15]","Half Blood Prince was one of my favorite books in the series so I was looking forward to finally watching the film which I just did.  Sadly, even the 3 cups of coffee I had today could barely keep me awake for this dreadful, dull  and horribly depicted film.  How it is possible that a franchise with as much going for it as Harry Potter could allow this to happen?My own two cents:1.  There was way too much time spent on and with Horace Slugworth.  He had no fire and to watch all his onscreen time was an exercise in patience.2.  One of my favorite story lines in the book was Tom Riddle's family.  They were so well written and interesting, they could have taken 15 minutes of time from Sluggy and that unfunny running gag of Ron's stalking admirer and invested us in getting to know Tom's people.3.  I understand the books/films get darker as they progress.  I get this however one of the things I have always loved was the whimsical and magical objects and beings such as Nearly Headless Nick, Moaning Myrtle, moving staircases, howlers and talking paintings.  It's like this was no longer Hogwarts, a school of wizardry but a broken down castle with no element of anything magical.4.  There are always going to be people who complain about what the film didn't cover and what was in the film but not the book but if you're going to tamper with a book such as HP, MAKE IT INTERESTING.Let's do this one over.  Can we please?  I'd rather sit through a half hour with Dolores Umbridge, incessently meowing cats while she sips tea from her dainty teacup as her magic pen writes (painfully) on my hand one thousand time, ""I must not write unkind reviews"" (true as they may be).",2,Arggghhhh,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1678,"['Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'was', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'series', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'finally', 'watching', 'film', 'just', 'did', 'Sadly', 'even', '3', 'cups', 'coffee', 'had', 'today', 'could', 'barely', 'keep', 'awake', 'dreadful', 'dull', 'horribly', 'depicted', 'film', 'How', 'possible', 'franchise', 'as', 'much', 'going', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'could', 'allow', 'happen', 'own', 'two', 'cents:1', 'was', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'spent', 'Horace', 'Slugworth', 'had', 'fire', 'watch', 'onscreen', 'time', 'was', 'exercise', 'patience.2', 'One', 'favorite', 'story', 'lines', 'book', 'was', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'family', 'were', 'so', 'well', 'written', 'interesting', 'could', 'have', 'taken', '15', 'minutes', 'time', 'Sluggy', 'unfunny', 'running', 'gag', 'Ron', 'stalking', 'admirer', 'invested', 'getting', 'know', 'Tom', 'people.3', 'understand', 'books/films', 'get', 'darker', 'progress', 'get', 'however', 'one', 'things', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'was', 'whimsical', 'magical', 'objects', 'beings', 'such', 'Nearly', 'Headless', 'Nick', 'Moaning', 'Myrtle', 'moving', 'staircases', 'howlers', 'talking', 'paintings', 'was', 'longer', 'school', 'wizardry', 'broken', 'down', 'castle', 'element', 'anything', 'magical.4', 'are', 'always', 'going', 'be', 'people', 'who', 'complain', 'what', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'cover', 'what', 'was', 'film', 'not', 'book', ""'re"", 'going', 'tamper', 'book', 'such', 'HP', 'MAKE', 'IT', 'INTERESTING.Let', 'do', 'one', 'Can', 'please', ""'d"", 'rather', 'sit', 'half', 'hour', 'Dolores', 'Umbridge', 'incessently', 'meowing', 'cats', 'tea', 'dainty', 'teacup', 'magic', 'pen', 'writes', 'painfully', 'hand', 'one', 'thousand', 'time', 'must', 'not', 'write', 'unkind', 'reviews', 'true', 'may', 'be']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1121999,A4ZQZP41D95JO,B000ZECQ08,Chad Varnadore,"[1, 1]","This franchise is one of the few that can safely refute the old adage that sequels are never as good as the original.  Indeed, it's something of an amazement how the Potter franchise has managed to maintain such quality of filmmaking after so many sequels.  I think that's why interest is still so high for these films after so many years and probably why the final book is being split into 2 films, to milk it for all they can - not to imply the story isn't worth it; I'm glad their are two more films to look forward to rather than just one.  But, as with most of the other larger book translations (eg. Goblet of Fire) there was a lot of interesting moments cut from the film rendition that we can only hope may someday be restored in the eventual ultimate BD editions ala the first two films (assuming they were actually shot).As is, the sixth film in the Potter franchise plays more like a filler to build anticipation for the final installments, than a self-contained story with a unique and notable purpose of its own.  The series has become progressively darker and more mature with each installment and this is no exception.  Gone is much of the innocense and naive wonder that built this esoteric cobblestone world.  But for those of us so enthralled, seeing it visually imagined as capably, dare I say, brilliantly, can be reward enough (assuming the final chapters make up for the story that this one lacks) even if there is little payoff in the end.As for the BD, I think Warner's authoring has gradually improved over the past couple of years.  The days of their masters being biased for the limitations of the DVD format seems to be drifting further and further behind - at least for new release titles.  Most of their catalog HD offerings still tend to be a little lacking in detail - often more than a little.  But with films that have been recently mastered like this one, there's little reason to complain, based on 1080p/24 projection onto a 100"" screen (smaller displays will no doubt be more foregiving, just as larger projected images could magnify problems I didn't notice or at least didn't find too cumbersome).",3,"The weakest installment in the series, but one that powerfully promises great things to come.",1267747200,"03 5, 2010",2010,2137,"['franchise', 'one', 'few', 'can', 'safely', 'refute', 'old', 'adage', 'sequels', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'Indeed', 'something', 'amazement', 'how', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'managed', 'maintain', 'such', 'quality', 'filmmaking', 'so', 'many', 'sequels', 'think', 'why', 'interest', 'still', 'so', 'high', 'films', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'probably', 'why', 'final', 'book', 'being', 'split', '2', 'films', 'milk', 'can', 'not', 'imply', 'story', ""n't"", 'worth', ""'m"", 'glad', 'are', 'two', 'more', 'films', 'look', 'forward', 'rather', 'just', 'one', 'most', 'other', 'larger', 'book', 'translations', 'eg', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'was', 'lot', 'interesting', 'moments', 'cut', 'film', 'rendition', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'may', 'someday', 'be', 'restored', 'eventual', 'ultimate', 'BD', 'editions', 'ala', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'assuming', 'were', 'actually', 'shot', '.As', 'sixth', 'film', 'Potter', 'franchise', 'more', 'filler', 'build', 'anticipation', 'final', 'installments', 'self-contained', 'story', 'unique', 'notable', 'purpose', 'own', 'series', 'become', 'progressively', 'darker', 'more', 'mature', 'installment', 'exception', 'Gone', 'much', 'innocense', 'naive', 'wonder', 'built', 'esoteric', 'cobblestone', 'world', 'so', 'enthralled', 'seeing', 'visually', 'imagined', 'capably', 'dare', 'say', 'brilliantly', 'can', 'be', 'reward', 'enough', 'assuming', 'final', 'chapters', 'make', 'up', 'story', 'one', 'even', 'little', 'payoff', 'end.As', 'BD', 'think', 'Warner', 'authoring', 'gradually', 'improved', 'past', 'couple', 'years', 'days', 'masters', 'being', 'biased', 'limitations', 'DVD', 'format', 'be', 'drifting', 'further', 'further', 'least', 'new', 'release', 'titles', 'Most', 'catalog', 'HD', 'offerings', 'still', 'tend', 'be', 'little', 'lacking', 'detail', 'often', 'more', 'little', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'recently', 'mastered', 'one', 'little', 'reason', 'complain', 'based', '1080p/24', 'projection', '100', 'screen', 'smaller', 'displays', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'more', 'foregiving', 'just', 'larger', 'projected', 'images', 'could', 'magnify', 'problems', 'did', ""n't"", 'notice', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'too', 'cumbersome']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1122003,A2G51QSW9WB8I7,B000ZECQ08,Chip,"[0, 0]","SPOILERS BELOWAll right, so I've come to the conclusion that Half Blood Prince is my least favorite of the Harry Potter movies. It's not because of all the stuff that is cut from the book, but simply because it just doesn't ""draw me in"" like the other ones do. I know the first two films aren't perfect, but they both make me so happy whenever I watch them (probably because of the nostalgia). My favorites in the series are Deathly Hallows Part I, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Order of the Phoenix.That being said, I do like Half Blood Prince. I thought Michael Gambon gave his best Dumbledore performance here, all the young actors were good, Jim Broadbent was good (really, the acting was perfectly fine). The Cave scene is hands down the best scene in the film in my opinion. Overall, though, Half Blood Prince focused too much on the comedy/romantic aspects. I was perfectly fine with the fact that Hogwarts was more ""sexified"", but it felt as though the Tom Riddle (and the Half Blood Prince story) took a back seat to it. But still, this movie has other things to offer, and it has gorgeous cinematography.The DVD itself is really good. None of the DVDs so far have topped the Goblet of Fire DVD, which is completely stocked with great Bonus features. This DVD has some good ones, and the best one has to be the J.K. Rowling documentary. It really gives fans a deeper insight into how J.K.'s life influenced the books.Overall, I'd say this is worth the purchase if you're a Harry Potter fan and you want some neat bonus features on your DVD.

It seems that every scene takes place either at night or in some dim and threatening setting.  Even the school itself is no longer the island of safety it once was.  And although Harry and Dumbledore have managed to convince the wizarding world that Lord Voldemort has indeed returned, that fact alone is enough to make life much more perilous for our young hero.  While Dumbledore tries to discover what Voldemort's weakness may be and provides Harry with special tutoring to prepare him for the inevitable confrontation, Harry struggles to deal with the eternal teenage verities of love and the choice of career--but always with his enemy's lurking presence as his major focus.  A mysterious Potions text labelled ""property of the Half-Blood Prince"" proves pivotal to the story, and as the film approaches its conclusion, changes and revelations come thick and fast.Like its two immediate predecessors, and probably inevitably, the sixth Harry movie loses something in translation from print, since the increasingly complex books can't be wholly transferred to film.  Indeed, disappointingly, although we do learn the identity of the Prince in the end, there are no details given as to why he called himself that, so curious viewers will definitely have to crack the book if they haven't done so already.

Even if, like me, you've already read the book and know what happens, there's something about actually seeing it on screen that thoroughly and devastatingly brings it home. That's the magic of the movies for you. Indeed, this sixth installment may be the most magical yet ... albeit magical in that heavy, sinister sort of way, as if Lord Voldermort himself waved his wand and cast a spell on it. Strange that this is simultaneously the darkest film in the series and the funniest, the sense of humor having matured from innocent and childlike to troubled and adolescent. Stranger still that this is the best ""Harry Potter"" film since the original ""Sorcerer's Stone,"" a brighter and much more whimsical and story in all respects.When reviewing ""Order of the Phoenix"" a few years ago, I begrudgingly remarked that I had to accept the ever-changing nature of the series, that the wondrous atmosphere of Chris Columbus' original film had developed into something denser and would never go back. I now find myself in the exact same position with ""Half-Blood Prince."" But I can't kid myself--this is a superbly made fantasy, and in spite of increasingly dark material, it retains much of the charm that attracted me to the series in the first place. The performances, even by briefly seen actors like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis, and Warwick Davis, are very good. The set design and cinematography are stunning. The special effects are dazzling. The mystery is engrossing. Just like before, it's all there--it's only gotten a little less bright on the way. Hogwarts, for example, no longer seems like an adventurous labyrinth of surprises but like a gloomy, gothic fortress, and the school grounds are foggier and less colorful.The first part of the story: After the dreaded Death Eaters attack London in full view of Muggles, our increasingly burdened Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is lead by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to the home of Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), a former Hogwarts professor who knew Voldermort when he was a boy still going by the name Tom Riddle. Dumbledore convinces Slughorn to come out of hiding and return to school as the new Potions teacher. He also relies on Harry to get close to join Slughorn's class and get to know him, which shouldn't be too hard since Slughorn loves to play favorites with his students. But why does he want Harry to do this? What does Slughorn have that Dumbledore wants?More important questions arise. Who is the titular Half-Blood Prince, and why did he add notes and revisions to every potion spell in Harry's textbook? Why is Harry's enemy, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), spending all his time away from class? He's not the same mean, confrontational boy he used to be; he's seething, withdrawn, and seemingly always on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Why is he guarded so closely by the brooding Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), who is this year's newest Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?The second part of the story: Harry and his best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are now sixteen years old, which is to say that they're in the thick of teen romances. Hermione is starting to have feelings for Ron, which is why she doesn't take kindly to Ron's new date, an infatuated young girl named Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). At the same time, Hermione catches the eye of Gryffindor House's newest Quiddich player, a smug young man named Cormac McLaggen (Freddie Stroma). She, however, has absolutely no interest in him. As for Harry, the relationship that bloomed in ""Order of the Phoenix"" between him and Cho Chang has been pushed aside in favor of a relationship between him and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).As far as these characters go, I was most impressed with the way Hermione was developed. She's well on her way to womanhood, and as such, she's genuinely jealous of the attention Ron gives to Lavender. This is at times funny, as when she intentionally asks Cormac to a Christmas party. It's also at times surprisingly tender, as when she clings to Harry's arm, silently weeping. Emma Watson has always been good as Hermione, but her range has never been as far-reaching as it is in this film. The same can be said for Rupert Grint, especially during a scene in which he accidentally eats chocolates spiked with a powerful love potion.The final act begins with Harry and Dumbledore visiting a seaside cave and having a frightening encounter with demon-like water creatures. It only goes downhill from there in terms of tone, and that brings me back to the ending. What an emotionally draining way to finish a ""Harry Potter"" film. Those who have not read J.K. Rowling's original novel may not be prepared for it. But even if that's the case, I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone avoid this film. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" may be darker than its predecessors, but it's filled to the brim with style and imagination, and it reveals new dimensions to characters we've come to know and love. With only the seventh and eighth films left (the final book being split into two screenplays), we can begin the process of looking back and remembering how great an experience it has been.",5,Dark

I didn't own the DVD version of this so I wasn't upgrading.First, I like that the movies are sticking closer to the events in the books.  After the debacle that was Goblet of Fire, this and The Order of the Phoenix were refreshing breaths of fresh air.  The series does take a dark turn (as it has been since the 3rd film).  Without going into the plot and events, suffice to say this film is full of surprises and shockers (for those who haven't read the book).At $34.99 I might have cringed a bit, but the Blu-Ray transfer is very nice.  I play on a Toshiba 49"" LCD 1080p through my PS3 and it looks great.  If you already own the DVD and want to upgrade to the HD version, then I would recommend it.  Just not for the MSRP.  Wait for a better price like I did!Movie - 5 starsBlu-Ray Transfer - 5 starsExtras - 4 or 5 stars (lots of extra content)Of note:  I did not see any of the black bands that a few other reviewers mentioned.  It may have been a bad initial batch or something intermittent.Also, this doesn't really follow the book very well, but the director is trying to pack a lot of content into a finite film length, so sometimes sacrifices must be made.  I for one am glad that it is not 100% by the book.

1122010,AM2UOU0N74HHJ,B000ZECQ08,"CK Webb ""CK Webb""","[2, 2]","Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was directed by David Yates and released in theatres on July 15, 2009. It was released on DVD December 08, 2009. The movie stars Danielle Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) as the young trio of friends attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.Since the murder of Sirius Black and the escape of the Death Eaters from Azcaban Prison, no one is safe. Wizards, witches and muggles alike are being terrorized by the Death Eaters and their seemingly misguided dedication to Lord Voldemort. When professor Albus Dumbledore once again asks Harry Potter for his help, the search begins for a missing memory that is key to Voldemort's existence and also to his destruction.While searching for the missing memory, Harry inadvertently comes across a 'potions book' once owned by The Half-Blood Prince, but who is he? A series of vicious attacks aimed at the now aging Dumbledore prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to search out the Half-Blood Prince and try, yet again to uncover the one thing that will rid the wizardry world of Voldemort forever. But they will suffer great loss along the way and no one will be the same after they find what they seek.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is, of course, visually stunning and yet I found myself wanting more as the credits rolled. This is not the Harry PotterI have grown to expect and the supporting character's rolls were dull and lackluster. The lead characters did do their very best to save the film and it is for that reason, and that reason alone that I long to see the two final movies.I must say that I was slightly disappointed by this film, however my children enjoyed it immensely. I am quite sure that lovers of the Harry Potter series will want to see The Half Blood Prince, as they should, in order to continue on with the series' storyline. I can only hope that the next Harry Potter movie doesn't leave me asking 'What Happened?' and that the story I have grown to love returns to the big screen. I am sadly giving Harry Potter and the Half -Blood Prince a 3-star rating and am doing so in hopes of better things to come.

They can't just make up an extended version by cobbling togetehr deleted scenes and include it on the disc. The original DIRECTOR of the films has to be commissioned by the Production studio to come back and essentially re-edit the film and create a new transfer, essentially creating a new version.Most director's don't have time for this process. Chris Columbus was able to because, as of late, he doesn't seem as busy and the subsequent directors. David Yates has been busy creating the momumentally epic conclusion to this series and unfortunately, that didn't allow him the time to come up with director's extended cuts in time for the studio's release dates for 5 and 6.As for 3 and 4, there NEVER WAS any director's extended cuts, as the director's of those films stated that what was released in theatres was their intended vision. David Yates may have meant to include more, but ultimately he never was able to make time as he has a wonderful final installment to get made.Read the books, watch the deleted scenes and shut up! These are still ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITIONS because each contains the ONLY VERSION of 3,4,5 and 6 that exist. If you want extended cuts, become a director, do a remake and then see how easy it is to fight the studio in charge of theatrical distribution. THEY control the money and the decisions.

Not such a bargain at $9.99 after all since I now need to go buy a new DVD if I want to watch the movie again without all the problems.As for the movie itself, not my favorite, they left out a lot of important stuff and added some things not even in the book (what's up with Harry and the waitress?) but it was still fun to watch and the special effects are fantastic as usual.

1122017,A33X5YSRG6YRQI,B000ZECQ08,Cory LaFerriere,"[51, 69]","My main gripe with the previous Harry Potter movie ""Order of the Phoenix"" was that for some strange reason they took the longest of the books and turned it into the shortest Harry Potter movie to date.  The result was that I felt like I was watching the movie fly by on a speeding train, as it rushed from one key event to another without really taking the time to explore anything in detail.Now we follow up with ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" and....what a difference.  There are plenty of cuts of course, no Harry Potter movie can be free of cuts without being waaaay too long.  But the movie's length was at least comparable to some of the others.  The 3 lead characters were as spot on as ever.  Michael Gambon finally brings a bit more warmth to his portrayal of Albus Dumbledor than he brought to the last few movies.  Tom Felton played Draco Malfoy with all the depth one would hope for in his most important role in the series.  Alan Rickman isn't seen too much as Severus Snape, but when he is he's as wonderful as ever.I really think this may be the best Harry Potter film yet, and I was really starting to think after the last film that the story had gotten to big for them to manage in film.

1122018,A2BT578J4IZOK6,B000ZECQ08,"Craobh Rua ""Craobh Rua""","[1, 2]","Based on the sixth book in J.K Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Half-Blood Prince"" first hit the big screen in 2009.Orphaned as a baby and subsequently raised (in the loosest possible terms) by his Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, Harry's early years were thoroughly miserable. Although he had been told his parents had died in a car crash, they were actually murdered by an evil wizard called Voldemort. Harry, however, somehow survived this attack and Voldemort subsequently disappeared for many years. Harry learnt of his past when he was eleven, and has since been attending Hogwarts - a very prestigious school for training young witches and wizards. The years in between have provided him with some of the happiest moments of his life : he has made friends for the first time - including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger - and he has become the Seeker on Gryffindor's Quidditch team. The school's headmaster Albus Dumbledore, considered by many to be the greatest wizard of modern times, has become something of a role model to him. Unfortunately, it has also become apparent that Voldemort's disappearance was only temporary - and, while many in the wizarding world have tried to pretend otherwise, his return cannot now be ignored. Furthermore, Harry has now been identified as the `Chosen One' and is destined to battle with Voldemort again - with only one of the two surviving. Despite the enhanced security at Hogwarts, however, Harry can't feel entirely safe there. Professor Snape, the Potions teacher who has picked on Harry from the day he arrived, was a once noted Death Eater...and, despite Dumbledore's assurances, Harry has never trusted him. Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch-nemesis among the student body, is the son of another noted Death Eater...and Harry believes Draco is now following in his father's footsteps. As it turns out, Harry's suspicions may not be entirely groundless...The film opens with Dumbledore surprising Harry wait a visit, towards the end of the summer holidays...and taking him onwards, to meet a former colleague called Professor Horace Slughorn. Dumbledore hopes he will return to the teaching staff - and has brought Harry along as `bait'. (He has a record of `collecting' talented young witches and wizards - and Dumbledore knows he wouldn't be able to resist Harry). Naturally, he caves in...though a return to Hogwarts would be a great relief to him. Voldemort - who also features in Slughorn's collection of notable past pupils - has desperately been trying to add him to the Death Eaters.When he arrives back at Hogwarts, however, Harry's surprised to learn Slughorn is taking over as Potions teacher - with Snape finally taking over the Defence Against the Dark Arts job. The shuffle also means that Harry will be able to take both subjects - both are needed for him to become an Auror. (Snape had threatened to keep him out of the NEWT-level Potions class, for not achieving the top grade at OWL Level. Slughorn, on the other hand, is more than happy to accept him). Since he hadn't bought any books for the Potions course in Diagon Alley, Harry borrows an old copy of the textbook from the classroom's store. It puts Harry at an immediate advantage over his classmates, thanks to some very helpful notes made by its previous owner...someone who called himself the 'Half-Blood Prince'. Harry is also getting some additional 'classes' with Dumbledore - where he learns more about Voldemort's past. However, they're not very regular as Dumbledore seems to be spending a lot of time away from Hogwarts....and there is a little homework, that involves working closely with Slughorn.Unsurprisingly, given the length of the book, not everything makes it into the film. While some of Harry's lessons with Dumbledore are dropped, and there's no mention of Grimmauld Place, the changes and the omissions at the film's climax surprised me most of all...there were a couple of scenes there, I'd have thought, would have been a film-maker's dream. Nevertheless, looking at the film in isolation - rather than comparing it to the book - I did find it very enjoyable. It was very dark and stylish, while Helena Bonham Carter was - once again - outstanding in her far-too-brief appearance as Bellatrix. (I wish something had been done to extend her screen-time. A bit more of Luna would've been welcomed too). Malfoy is no longer the strutting, preening bully, and clearly struggles with what's expected of him throughout the year. Overall, I enjoyed it - while the Potter diehards mightn't be too happy with it, I found it a fun way to pass a couple of hours.",4,"Da Do Won-Won-Won, Da Do Won-Won",1262217600,"12 31, 2009",2009,4599,"['Based', 'sixth', 'book', 'J.K', 'Rowling', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'first', 'hit', 'big', 'screen', '2009.Orphaned', 'baby', 'subsequently', 'raised', 'loosest', 'possible', 'terms', 'Uncle', 'Vernon', 'Aunt', 'Petunia', 'Harry', 'early', 'years', 'were', 'thoroughly', 'miserable', 'had', 'been', 'told', 'parents', 'had', 'died', 'car', 'crash', 'were', 'actually', 'murdered', 'evil', 'wizard', 'called', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'however', 'somehow', 'survived', 'attack', 'Voldemort', 'subsequently', 'disappeared', 'many', 'years', 'Harry', 'learnt', 'past', 'when', 'was', 'eleven', 'been', 'attending', 'Hogwarts', 'very', 'prestigious', 'school', 'training', 'young', 'witches', 'wizards', 'years', 'have', 'provided', 'happiest', 'moments', 'life', 'made', 'friends', 'first', 'time', 'including', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Hermione', 'Granger', 'become', 'Seeker', 'Gryffindor', 'Quidditch', 'team', 'school', 'headmaster', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'considered', 'many', 'be', 'greatest', 'wizard', 'modern', 'times', 'become', 'something', 'role', 'model', 'Unfortunately', 'also', 'become', 'apparent', 'Voldemort', 'disappearance', 'was', 'only', 'temporary', 'many', 'wizarding', 'world', 'have', 'tried', 'pretend', 'otherwise', 'return', 'can', 'not', 'now', 'be', 'ignored', 'Furthermore', 'Harry', 'now', 'been', 'identified', 'Chosen', 'One', 'destined', 'battle', 'Voldemort', 'again', 'only', 'one', 'two', 'surviving', 'enhanced', 'security', 'Hogwarts', 'however', 'Harry', 'ca', ""n't"", 'feel', 'entirely', 'safe', 'there', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Potions', 'teacher', 'who', 'picked', 'Harry', 'day', 'arrived', 'was', 'once', 'noted', 'Death', 'Eater', 'Dumbledore', 'assurances', 'Harry', 'never', 'trusted', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Harry', 'arch-nemesis', 'student', 'body', 'son', 'noted', 'Death', 'Eater', 'Harry', 'Draco', 'now', 'following', 'father', 'footsteps', 'out', 'Harry', 'suspicions', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'entirely', 'groundless', 'film', 'Dumbledore', 'surprising', 'Harry', 'wait', 'visit', 'end', 'summer', 'holidays', 'taking', 'onwards', 'meet', 'former', 'colleague', 'called', 'Professor', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'Dumbledore', 'will', 'return', 'teaching', 'staff', 'brought', 'Harry', 'along', 'bait', 'record', 'collecting', 'talented', 'young', 'witches', 'wizards', 'Dumbledore', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'able', 'resist', 'Harry', 'Naturally', 'return', 'Hogwarts', 'would', 'be', 'great', 'relief', 'Voldemort', 'who', 'also', 'Slughorn', 'collection', 'notable', 'past', 'pupils', 'desperately', 'been', 'trying', 'add', 'Death', 'Eaters.When', 'back', 'Hogwarts', 'however', 'Harry', 'surprised', 'learn', 'Slughorn', 'taking', 'over', 'Potions', 'Snape', 'finally', 'taking', 'over', 'Defence', 'Against', 'Dark', 'Arts', 'job', 'shuffle', 'also', 'Harry', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'take', 'subjects', 'are', 'needed', 'become', 'Auror', 'Snape', 'had', 'threatened', 'keep', 'NEWT-level', 'Potions', 'class', 'not', 'achieving', 'top', 'grade', 'OWL', 'Level', 'Slughorn', 'other', 'hand', 'more', 'happy', 'accept', 'had', ""n't"", 'bought', 'books', 'Potions', 'course', 'Diagon', 'Alley', 'Harry', 'old', 'copy', 'textbook', 'classroom', 'store', 'Harry', 'immediate', 'advantage', 'classmates', 'thanks', 'very', 'helpful', 'notes', 'made', 'previous', 'owner', 'someone', 'who', 'called', ""'Half-Blood"", 'Prince', 'Harry', 'also', 'getting', 'additional', ""'classes"", 'Dumbledore', 'where', 'more', 'Voldemort', 'past', 'However', ""'re"", 'not', 'very', 'regular', 'Dumbledore', 'be', 'spending', 'lot', 'time', 'away', 'Hogwarts', '.and', 'little', 'homework', 'working', 'closely', 'Slughorn.Unsurprisingly', 'given', 'length', 'book', 'not', 'everything', 'film', 'Harry', 'lessons', 'Dumbledore', 'are', 'dropped', 'mention', 'Grimmauld', 'Place', 'changes', 'omissions', 'film', 'climax', 'surprised', 'most', 'were', 'couple', 'scenes', 'there', ""'d"", 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'film-maker', 'dream', 'Nevertheless', 'looking', 'film', 'isolation', 'rather', 'comparing', 'book', 'did', 'find', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'was', 'very', 'dark', 'stylish', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'was', 'once', 'again', 'outstanding', 'far-too-brief', 'appearance', 'Bellatrix', 'wish', 'something', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'extend', 'screen-time', 'bit', 'more', 'Luna', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'welcomed', 'too', 'Malfoy', 'no', 'longer', 'strutting', 'preening', 'bully', 'clearly', 'struggles', 'what', 'expected', 'year', 'Overall', 'enjoyed', 'Potter', 'diehards', 'might', ""n't"", 'be', 'too', 'happy', 'found', 'fun', 'way', 'pass', 'couple', 'hours']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122019,A2RLK9KKVGEETZ,B000ZECQ08,"C. Tsao ""Seaview1""","[0, 3]","This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.A new school year begins, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is coming to terms with being the `chosen one' to do battle against the ultimate in evil wizardry, Lord Voldemort and the evil Death Eaters surrounding Hogwart.  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry to serve as bait to draw out the supremely evil Voldemort.  An older Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) returns to the school and brings with him a mysterious history of having taught the boy who became Lord Voldemort.  Harry in the meantime discovers a manuscript by the `Half-Blood Prince' and thinks that it is the key to learning the wizardry secret that will enable Harry and his comrades, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to defeat the man who killed his parents and godfather, Sirius Black.  Harry's school rival Draco harbors revenge against him for the death of his evil father.  There is the aerial game Quidditch that challenges Ron's mettle, and the blossoming of adolescent romance between Potter and Ron's sister, Ginny and between Ron and  Hermione.  Then there is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and some mysterious behavior that questions his allegiance.  As Dumbledore makes Harry promise to do whatever he instructs, the Death Eaters are unleashed within Hogwart with devastating consequences and a shocking betrayal that will forever change the destiny of the school and foreshadow the coming showdown with Voldemort.This is a more grownup Potter as it explores relationships more thoroughly and some amusing situations arise such as a love triangle that plagues Ron.  It is amusing to see how hormones are thriving amongst the teens and love is in the air.  Growing up was never this hard. There are also surprises of a high order that will send the series on a new, ominous path while raising questions about the loyalty of a major player. The one constant is our beloved trio of maturing wizards who must face an uncertain future without an important character.  The film reinforces the continuous themes of loyalty and friendship among our wizard heroes.  That bond and natural chemistry among the three actors is partly what holds this remarkable series together.Most of the characters are back from the previous film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  It does feel like school has restarted when Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall (venerable Maggie Smith) show up.  Other familiar faces reappear, which greatly help in the continuity and progression of the story.  The filmmakers are wise to introduce a couple new characters here and there without shaking up the status quo too much.  All the Potter films have benefited from a strong focus on storyline in keeping with the novel sources.Production values are topnotch again, and the dark, moody colored cinematography is an artistic triumph. It is impressive at how mainstream films have pushed the creative aspects of filmmaking without sacrificing popularity; witness the cinematography and art direction of The Dark Knight and the film editing in The Bourne Ultimatum.  It has almost become pass&eacute; to expect imaginative state of the art special effects in the Potter films, but they are always serving the plot and not merely to draw attention to the spectacle itself.Since these are British performers, there is a bit of adjusting to their heavy British accents.  This film, perhaps more than any other, assumes that the audience is already well versed on Potter lore, and so it may prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated.  It starts out well and tries one's patience just a tad as it builds a complex narrative that loses steam half-way through and picks up momentum toward the end and never lets up with a devastating payoff which in turn sets up the two part finale in grand fashion.Though not the best film of the series, The Half-Blood Prince sets the table for the final battle of good versus evil.  This must be a pretty good film because I can't wait for the final installments.",3,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince Sets the Finale,1251590400,"08 30, 2009",2009,4351,"['remarkably', 'well', 'balanced', 'series', 'wildly', 'successful', 'films', 'based', 'equally', 'popular', 'series', 'novels', 'J.', 'K.', 'Rowling', 'signs', 'waning', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'Potter', 'veteran', 'director', 'David', 'Yates', 'keeper', 'flame', 'scribe', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'have', 'kept', 'together', 'burgeoning', 'franchise', 'laying', 'foundation', 'grand', 'finale.A', 'new', 'school', 'year', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'coming', 'terms', 'being', 'chosen', 'one', 'do', 'battle', 'ultimate', 'evil', 'wizardry', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'evil', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'surrounding', 'Hogwart', 'Professor', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Harry', 'serve', 'bait', 'draw', 'out', 'supremely', 'evil', 'Voldemort', 'older', 'Professor', 'Slughorn', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'school', 'brings', 'mysterious', 'history', 'having', 'taught', 'boy', 'who', 'became', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Harry', 'meantime', 'manuscript', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'key', 'learning', 'wizardry', 'secret', 'will', 'enable', 'Harry', 'comrades', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermione', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'defeat', 'man', 'who', 'killed', 'parents', 'godfather', 'Sirius', 'Black', 'Harry', 'school', 'rival', 'Draco', 'harbors', 'revenge', 'death', 'evil', 'father', 'aerial', 'game', 'Quidditch', 'Ron', 'mettle', 'blossoming', 'adolescent', 'romance', 'Potter', 'Ron', 'sister', 'Ginny', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'Then', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'mysterious', 'behavior', 'questions', 'allegiance', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'promise', 'do', 'whatever', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'are', 'unleashed', 'Hogwart', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'shocking', 'betrayal', 'will', 'forever', 'change', 'destiny', 'school', 'foreshadow', 'coming', 'showdown', 'Voldemort.This', 'more', 'grownup', 'Potter', 'relationships', 'more', 'thoroughly', 'amusing', 'situations', 'arise', 'such', 'love', 'triangle', 'Ron', 'amusing', 'see', 'how', 'hormones', 'are', 'thriving', 'teens', 'love', 'air', 'Growing', 'up', 'was', 'never', 'hard', 'are', 'also', 'surprises', 'high', 'order', 'will', 'send', 'series', 'new', 'ominous', 'path', 'raising', 'questions', 'loyalty', 'major', 'player', 'one', 'constant', 'beloved', 'trio', 'maturing', 'wizards', 'who', 'must', 'face', 'uncertain', 'future', 'important', 'character', 'film', 'continuous', 'themes', 'loyalty', 'friendship', 'wizard', 'heroes', 'bond', 'natural', 'chemistry', 'three', 'actors', 'partly', 'what', 'remarkable', 'series', 'together.Most', 'characters', 'are', 'back', 'previous', 'film', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'feel', 'school', 'restarted', 'when', 'Professors', 'Dumbledore', 'Snape', 'McGonagall', 'venerable', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'show', 'up', 'Other', 'familiar', 'reappear', 'greatly', 'help', 'continuity', 'progression', 'story', 'filmmakers', 'are', 'wise', 'introduce', 'couple', 'new', 'characters', 'here', 'there', 'shaking', 'up', 'status', 'quo', 'too', 'much', 'Potter', 'films', 'have', 'benefited', 'strong', 'focus', 'storyline', 'keeping', 'novel', 'sources.Production', 'values', 'are', 'topnotch', 'again', 'dark', 'moody', 'colored', 'cinematography', 'artistic', 'triumph', 'impressive', 'how', 'mainstream', 'films', 'have', 'pushed', 'creative', 'aspects', 'filmmaking', 'sacrificing', 'popularity', 'cinematography', 'art', 'direction', 'Dark', 'Knight', 'film', 'editing', 'Bourne', 'Ultimatum', 'almost', 'become', 'pass', 'eacute', 'expect', 'imaginative', 'state', 'art', 'special', 'effects', 'Potter', 'films', 'are', 'always', 'serving', 'plot', 'not', 'merely', 'draw', 'attention', 'spectacle', 'itself.Since', 'are', 'British', 'performers', 'bit', 'adjusting', 'heavy', 'British', 'accents', 'film', 'perhaps', 'more', 'other', 'audience', 'already', 'well', 'versed', 'Potter', 'lore', 'may', 'prove', 'bit', 'confusing', 'uninitiated', 'out', 'well', 'one', 'patience', 'just', 'tad', 'complex', 'narrative', 'steam', 'half-way', 'picks', 'up', 'momentum', 'end', 'never', 'up', 'devastating', 'payoff', 'turn', 'sets', 'up', 'two', 'part', 'finale', 'grand', 'not', 'best', 'film', 'series', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'table', 'final', 'battle', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'must', 'be', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'final', 'installments']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The story also made no sense. No, I did not read the books, nor would I ever waste my time. The only strength in the world of Harry Potter is the bond amongst friends. This strong sense of friendship and loyalty is the only reason this annoying film was given two stars instead of one!I guess that's the reason why I, and many other people, keep going to the theater. Of the six films, only the previous one, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" felt enjoyable and made plenty of sense. In Half-Blood, I'm amazed that you can kill off a major character and have even Harry Potter, himself, going around saying: ""It was a waste, it had no meaning. He died for nothing."" How ironic when a story's main character literally sums up the ENTIRE story!I had high hopes for Half-Blood! I don't like seeing Harry Potter and all the other ""Good Guys"" being so powerless/clueless, or a main character turning into pure evil for absolutely no reason, whatsoever! (I should be able to know what's going on by not having to read the books. I have watched every film in order, but it still made no sense!)What is obvious to me is that the Harry Potter series has become a commodity like toothpaste and underarm deodorant! Lets stretch a very thin storyline into as many billions of dollars as possible, and see all the star-struck idiots spend their money! Sorry to say, Harry Potter could have easily been condensed into a trilogy and if Half-Blood was never written/filmed it would not have harmed the Harry Potter storyline ONE iota!Sorry, but when the grand finale(s) (I just heard the ending is being split into two movies! What a surprise) comes out, I'm skipping the theaters and  I'll watch it when I can see it for free. I have spent enough money on Harry Potter movie tickets and I have no intention, whatsoever, to waste another penny on making the writers and filmmakers of Harry Potter, richer!SEE:Bad Movies We Love (Plume)andFilm as Commodity: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Newspaper Film Reviews",2,What Happens When You Write Yourself Into A Corner!,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,2145,"['found', 'Half-Blood', 'be', 'very', 'depressing', 'even', 'worse', 'predictable', 'greater', 'sin', 'writing', 'story', 'being', 'boring', 'story', 'also', 'made', 'sense', 'No', 'did', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'would', 'ever', 'waste', 'time', 'only', 'strength', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'bond', 'amongst', 'friends', 'strong', 'sense', 'friendship', 'loyalty', 'only', 'reason', 'annoying', 'film', 'was', 'given', 'two', 'stars', 'instead', 'one', 'guess', 'reason', 'why', 'many', 'other', 'people', 'keep', 'going', 'theater', 'six', 'films', 'only', 'previous', 'one', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'felt', 'enjoyable', 'made', 'plenty', 'sense', 'Half-Blood', ""'m"", 'amazed', 'can', 'kill', 'off', 'major', 'character', 'have', 'even', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'going', 'saying', 'was', 'waste', 'had', 'meaning', 'died', 'nothing', 'How', 'ironic', 'when', 'story', 'main', 'character', 'literally', 'up', 'ENTIRE', 'story', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Half-Blood', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'seeing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'other', 'Good', 'Guys', 'being', 'so', 'powerless/clueless', 'main', 'character', 'turning', 'pure', 'evil', 'absolutely', 'reason', 'whatsoever', 'should', 'be', 'able', 'know', 'what', 'going', 'not', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'order', 'still', 'made', 'sense', 'What', 'obvious', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'become', 'commodity', 'toothpaste', 'underarm', 'deodorant', 'stretch', 'very', 'thin', 'storyline', 'many', 'billions', 'dollars', 'possible', 'see', 'star-struck', 'idiots', 'spend', 'money', 'Sorry', 'say', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'could', 'have', 'easily', 'been', 'condensed', 'trilogy', 'Half-Blood', 'was', 'never', 'written/filmed', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'harmed', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'storyline', 'ONE', 'iota', 'Sorry', 'when', 'grand', 'finale', 's', 'just', 'heard', 'ending', 'being', 'split', 'two', 'movies', 'What', 'surprise', 'out', ""'m"", 'skipping', 'theaters', ""'ll"", 'watch', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'free', 'have', 'spent', 'enough', 'money', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'tickets', 'have', 'intention', 'whatsoever', 'waste', 'penny', 'making', 'writers', 'filmmakers', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'richer', 'SEE', 'Bad', 'Movies', 'Love', 'Plume', 'andFilm', 'Commodity', 'Critical', 'Discourse', 'Analysis', 'Newspaper', 'Film', 'Reviews']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Well, clearly I belong to the category of adults who have never read the books and were drawn in by their children, who did read the books.And at the end of it all, the only things that are clear to me about the success of the Harry Potter books and movies are:1. Their fascination for pre-pubescent children has always been in the fact that this is a tale of children, empowered by magic and living in a fantastical world, and able to show their stuff and prove their worth to the adults around them.2. The series mixes a complex fantasy world with brief interactions with the real world.  Which does create some gigantic plot holes, but it is also, I think one of the attractions of the movie series - that these are modern day British children and teenagers, easy to relate to, and living halfway in the real world, and halfway in this fantasy world.3. Somehow or another, ""Harry Potter"" managed to stand out enough from the crowd initially to become a Big Success as a book with its core audience of pre-pubescent children.  As everybody piled on top of this success, the first movie ""Sorcerer's Stone"" (""Philosopher's Stone"" outside of the U.S.) also became a resounding success.  Key to this was the casting and the careful shepharding of the storyline, and careful craftsmanship of the movie itself.  Turning a children's fantasy story into a movie goldmine is hardly automatic -as ""Golden Compass"" and ""Inkheart"" have shown.For me, one of the most pleasant aspects of slogging through all of these Harry Potter movies has been following the growth of the real-life actors and actresses on screen.  I think that this has been one of the main reasons for the success of Harry Potter the Franchise - the initial selection of such a group of healthy, wholesome, and really neat kids to play these characters.  Their natural likeability and talent has always come right out onto the screen, which has not been the case for other child actors (e.g., Jake Lloyd -young Anakin Skywalker, Dakota Richards - ""Golden Compass"").One wonders what would have happened if Terry Gilliam had been made the director of the first Harry Potter movie (as J.K. Rowling wanted), if the movie series would have developed a more sly and twisted sensibility than what it has become.  I would have loved to see that.For the movie series has evolved into a well-crafted but ponderous vehicle for decent entertainment.  The book series that it draws from was never as well constructed or well written as a fantasy world in the class of Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"".  And thus the movies reveal their uneven, plot-holed origins from the book.This particular movie especially required a guidebook, as in nearly every scene, stuff just happened that was never explained.  Of all the Harry Potter movies, this one had the least amount of exposition to it, a pity, since this section deals with the Origin of Voldemort.  I had my daughter with me, who helped explain parts of the movie.Viewers without a guide, who have never watched a previous Potter movie, and who have never read the book series, would almost certainly be left  completely clueless by the goings on in this movie.",3,"Stuff happens, accept it, and the Harry Potter Franchise lumbers on",1247961600,"07 19, 2009",2009,3362,"['go', 'now', 'zombies', 'drawn', 'raw', 'flesh', 'lemmings', 'sea', 'watch', 'latest', 'intallment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Franchise.So', 'why', 'do', 'people', 'go', 'droves', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'Well', 'clearly', 'belong', 'category', 'adults', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'books', 'were', 'drawn', 'children', 'who', 'did', 'read', 'books.And', 'end', 'only', 'things', 'are', 'clear', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'books', 'movies', 'are:1', 'fascination', 'pre-pubescent', 'children', 'always', 'been', 'fact', 'tale', 'children', 'empowered', 'magic', 'living', 'fantastical', 'world', 'able', 'show', 'stuff', 'prove', 'worth', 'adults', 'them.2', 'series', 'complex', 'fantasy', 'world', 'brief', 'interactions', 'real', 'world', 'create', 'gigantic', 'plot', 'holes', 'also', 'think', 'one', 'attractions', 'movie', 'series', 'are', 'modern', 'day', 'British', 'children', 'teenagers', 'easy', 'relate', 'living', 'halfway', 'real', 'world', 'halfway', 'fantasy', 'world.3', 'Somehow', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'managed', 'stand', 'out', 'enough', 'crowd', 'initially', 'become', 'Big', 'Success', 'book', 'core', 'audience', 'pre-pubescent', 'children', 'everybody', 'piled', 'top', 'success', 'first', 'movie', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'Philosopher', 'Stone', 'U.S.', 'also', 'became', 'resounding', 'success', 'Key', 'was', 'casting', 'careful', 'shepharding', 'storyline', 'careful', 'craftsmanship', 'movie', 'Turning', 'children', 'fantasy', 'story', 'movie', 'goldmine', 'hardly', 'automatic', '-as', 'Golden', 'Compass', 'Inkheart', 'have', 'shown.For', 'one', 'most', 'pleasant', 'aspects', 'slogging', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'been', 'following', 'growth', 'real-life', 'actors', 'actresses', 'screen', 'think', 'been', 'one', 'main', 'reasons', 'success', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Franchise', 'initial', 'selection', 'such', 'group', 'healthy', 'wholesome', 'really', 'neat', 'kids', 'play', 'characters', 'natural', 'likeability', 'talent', 'always', 'come', 'right', 'screen', 'not', 'been', 'case', 'other', 'child', 'actors', 'e.g.', 'Jake', 'Lloyd', '-young', 'Anakin', 'Skywalker', 'Dakota', 'Richards', 'Golden', 'Compass', '.One', 'wonders', 'what', 'would', 'have', 'happened', 'Terry', 'Gilliam', 'had', 'been', 'made', 'director', 'first', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'wanted', 'movie', 'series', 'would', 'have', 'developed', 'more', 'sly', 'twisted', 'sensibility', 'what', 'become', 'would', 'have', 'loved', 'see', 'movie', 'series', 'evolved', 'well-crafted', 'ponderous', 'vehicle', 'decent', 'entertainment', 'book', 'series', 'was', 'never', 'as', 'well', 'constructed', 'well', 'written', 'fantasy', 'world', 'class', 'Tolkien', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'thus', 'movies', 'reveal', 'uneven', 'plot-holed', 'origins', 'book.This', 'particular', 'movie', 'especially', 'required', 'guidebook', 'nearly', 'scene', 'stuff', 'just', 'happened', 'was', 'never', 'explained', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'one', 'had', 'least', 'amount', 'exposition', 'pity', 'section', 'Origin', 'Voldemort', 'had', 'daughter', 'who', 'helped', 'explain', 'parts', 'movie.Viewers', 'guide', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'watched', 'previous', 'Potter', 'movie', 'who', 'have', 'never', 'read', 'book', 'series', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'be', 'left', 'completely', 'clueless', 'goings', 'movie']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Just like the book, this movie focuses on Harry and Dumbledore using Voldemort's memories to try to find his seven Horcruxes in order to destroy them all and defeat him. In order to do this, Dumbledore and Harry hire a new teacher for the Potions class, Horace Slughorn, who has the memory of when Voldemort finds out about Horcruxes and decides to make them, which he doesn't want to give up. Also, Voldemort makes Draco Malfoy try to kill Dumbledore and, at the beginning of the film, the Death Eaters destroy a huge bridge in the Muggle world and eventually attack the Weasleys. Finally, there's a lot of stuff about the relationships/love between the characters, such as Lavender Brown falling in love with, and stalking, Ron, Harry eventually falling in love with, and kissing Ginny, and Ron and Hermione falling in love with each other. Eventually, the events of Dumbledore and Harry looking for and finding some of the Horcruxes leads to Dumbledore being killed by Snape, and a very powerful, emotionally moving ending. The storyline includes almost everything from the book, except, unfortunately, Kreacher and Dobby, Winky, and the other house-elves, and some of the scenes are a little bit less dramatic, such as when Harry has to force Dumbledore to drink the pain-inducing potion so they can get a Horcrux and when Harry battles Snape after Snape killed Dumbledore. The special effects are incredible, just like the other ""Harry Potter"" movies, such as when Dumbledore and Harry apparate to the cave where Voldemort's Horcrux is and the computer-animated Inferi. I loved this movie and I'm going to get it on DVD when it comes out!

1122033,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,B000ZECQ08,Deborah Earle,"[0, 0]","Director David Yates takes us through Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) pivotal sixth year at Hogwarts, where we see him growing still closer to his final confrontation with the Dark Wizard (Ralph Fiennes), who would quite faciley harm a guy in glasses.Still reeling from the aftermath of the Battle of the Ministry of Magic, Hary hasn't spent much time at his relatives' residence in Little Whinging, but has spent much of the summer riding trains to keep his mind off of things.At one point, as he is reading his wizarding world newspaper in a Muggle diner in Little Whinging, he enters into a flirtation with a pretty waitress(Elarica Gallander) who takes an interest in the contents of his newspaper.But a promising date with the young lady is aborted by the unexpected arrival of Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), who escorts Harry to the residence of Professor Horace Slughorn(Jim Broadbent) who is hiding from Voldemort and the Death Eaters. This professor, like many, knew Harry's parents, and Dumbledore wishes to have him reinstated at Hogwarts, as his presence there is essential to the defeat of Voldemort. Slughorn, who remembers Harry mother, Lily(Geraldine Sommerville), his former student, with a particular fondness, agrees to do so.Spending time with the Weasleys at their home, The Burrow before returning to school, Harry and his best friends, Ron(Rupert Grint)and Hermione(Emma Watson), enjoy each other's company, having a laugh over a wisecrack about Dumbledore's supposed age as they gather round an indoor fire burning from a magically suspended wad of newspaper, in what will be an ironic moment.As they leave the new joke shop run by Ron's brothers, twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), the three friends notice Draco Malfoy(Tom Felton)and his mother, Narcissa( Helen McCrory) going into Borgin and Burkes wandshop in the seedy Knockturn Alley, where they associate with Death Eaters. Voldemort has chosen Draco for a secret mission as the Dark Lord's grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds tightens. Making an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa a Bellatrix Lestrande's (Helena Bonham Carter) behest, Severus Snape( Alan Rickman) promises to shield Draco and accept the assignment if Draco fails to carry it out.Amid torment from Draco on the Hogwarts Express, Luna Lovegood(Evanna Lynch)rescues Harry.Once back on campus, Professor McGonnagal(Maggie Smith) urges Harry and Ron to take Slughorn's Potions class at the last moment, resulting in their having to borrow textbooks for the course, since they don't have their own. The phrase ""Half- Blood Prince"" is on the flypage of Harry's textbook, which features additional information ennabling him to excel in the class, even besting the brilliant Hermione.In the meantime, Ron, the new Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team wins a game because Harry psychs him into believing he has been given the potion, Liquid Luck.The new sports hero celebrates his new status as well as his budding romance with the ditzy Lavender Brown(Jessie Cave). Hermione is reviled and hurt by this,  turning to Harry for consolation as he admits his own feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright), who is currently dating his roomate, Dean Thomas(Alfie Enoch).Among the mysteries Harry and company will deal with besides that of the riddle of the Half-Blood Prince will be the mystery of what Slughorn knows about Voldemort's rise to power,and the curious possesion of student Katie Bell (Georgian Leonidas) after she is exposed to a beautiful necklance in a jewel case outside of Hogsmeade, and the question McGonagall broaches to him, Ron, and Hermione:""Why is it that when something happens, it is always you three?""This film will also reveal the loss of one of gamekeeper Hagrid's (Robbie Coltrane) cherished companions,and Harry's use of that opportunity to get Slughorn to reveal the truth about Voldemort's rise to power, as well as Harry's growing relationship with the Weasleys and Professor Lupin's(David Thewlis) and Tonks(Natalia Tena)amid the destruction of the Weasley's home by Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback(Dave Legano).Soon, the young James Bond of the Wizarding World will lose his staunchest champion amid a touching tribute led by McGonagall, in which the light of the wands of Hogwarts will drive the Dark Mark from the sky,hopefully symbolic of a favorable outcome for the forces of good in the not-too-distant future.",5,Shine A Light....,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",2012,4416,"['Director', 'David', 'Yates', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'pivotal', 'sixth', 'year', 'Hogwarts',

Like that film, it has numerous departures from the book, but viewed as part of the series of films (and NOT as a shoe-in for the book in the series of books), it works very well. I know that Rowling had approved the scripts to these films as they were made, so I'm sure that she always had a clear understanding of the consequences of any omissions (and additions) made to the events in terms of the subsequent films. So far, it has worked just fine. Are the negative Potter diehards worried that all these changes will somehow inevitably add up to a bad movie version of the ""Deathly Hallows""?I very much enjoyed the humor. Scenes such as the tribute to Aragog were hilarious, as well as the little touches - Ron sitting between Harry and Ginny at the Burrow, and Harry being informed of Vane's love potion plans by Hermione, and the brewing of ""Living Death""! Hermione's comments about Harry ""enjoying his dessert"", and her trying to explain to Ron how he split with Lavender during his recovery from poisoning (""I don't believe it was a particularly long conversation"") are also hilariously low key. Lavender's attentions to Ron are comical, and deliberately pitched as almost painful. The effects are convincing, and the actors have hit their stride.

1122038,A24SP9OBA2OO75,B000ZECQ08,D. Ferrari,"[2, 3]",While I would agree with the purists out there who felt somewhat cheated by this film leaving out vital details that are integral to the nature of Voldemort and his motivation while adding in three time consuming scenes that added nothing to the story whatsoever.  I also understand that movies have time constraints and studios don't want movies to be too long because that cuts down on the number of times the movie can be shown thus cutting into profits.  I get it.*****MILD SPOILERS BE AHEAD******I would have rather seen the memory of Tom Riddle trying to get on as the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher but being turned away which is the reason the post is now cursed than the Bridge Collapse scene.  Or Maybe the Dursleys at the beginning where Harry inherits Grimauld Place and Kreacher all at once instead of Harry chatting up a waitress at a train station.  Or some explanation as to the fact that the remaining Horcruxes would be tied to the Hogwarts founders because of how important Hogwarts was to Voldemort or maybe Dumbledore's funeral instead of the attack on the burrough.  And Harry not being petrified on the astronomy tower is just unforgiveable.  Lots of stuff that come part 7 isn't going to make a whole lot of sense if it is just dropped in out of nowhere.*****NO MORE SPOILERS*****All that being said the movie is still really good and very well made It just seems like they made it because they felt like they had to instead of truly wanting to bridge the gap to the final chapter in the saga.  3+ stars for the actual movie.Where it gets the extra star is for the amazing bonus features that I haven't even gotten the opportunity to scratch the surface of yet.  The brief but excellent featurette on the Deathly Hallows is outstanding.  The deleted scenes are okay.  A couple that could and probably SHOULD have been left in the final film.  The featurette on the Wizarding World opening up at Universal Orlando next year has me completely geeked to go.  They are outstanding.So to sum it up.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and enjoyed the movie even a little bit definately pick this up if for nothing else than the extra bonus features.

1122046,ACFXXSSFH9CWO,B000ZECQ08,Dolwyddelan,"[0, 0]","J.K. Rowling's tale is, as always, rife with fresh ideas, and her believable characters continue to endure further challenges in the process of growing-up.  Apart from the story's more fanciful elements, there are also some real-life lessons being learned here (in boy-girl relationships and academic cheating among them).That said, Rowling's extensive narrative doesn't fit so comfortably into a two-and-a-half hour running time.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves manages to get most of it all to work within the prescribed length (though it is hard to see the point of invented scenes like Harry's flirtation with a muggle girl in the London tube station when that screen-time could have been alloted to more of Rowling's own ideas).Director David Yates handles the material adroitly, but his style feels more perfunctory than the series' previous directors.  One scene in particular (which I won't spoil), is a major -- and devastating -- turning point in Rowling's tale, but it lacks any dramatic intensity and proves something of a lead balloon.  The film is technically well-photographed (by Bruno Delbonnel) but is awash in low-key, shadowy lighting, and a generally drab, washed-out colour scheme.  While effective in the spookier moments, this look doesn't suit the scenes of intimacy or humor, and tends to cast a dreary pall about the film.  Nicholas Hooper provides a serviceable score, but it too is lacklustre compared to the symphonic grandeur of John Williams' Harry Potter music.However the performers are (as usual) first rate. The established cast bring ever-more freshness to their parts, while newcomer Hero Fiennes-Tiffin (nephew of Ralph Fiennes) makes for an unnervingly sinister Tom Riddle, and veteran actor Jim Broadbent makes a fine Professor Slughorn.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a wonderful story which results in a very good film.  Warner Bros. Blu-ray disc boasts an excellent transfer with crisp detail.  But it does lack the epic sweep of the earlier films and doesn't deliver a satisfying emotional payoff, and so proves one of the less-enjoyable Potter adaptations.",3,Terrific adaptation (if less inspired than the previous movies),1338595200,"06 2, 2012",2012,2107,"['J.K.', 'Rowling', 'tale', 'always', 'rife', 'fresh', 'ideas', 'believable', 'characters', 'continue', 'endure', 'further', 'challenges', 'process', 'growing-up', 'Apart', 'story', 'more', 'fanciful', 'elements', 'are', 'also', 'real-life', 'lessons', 'being', 'learned', 'here', 'boy-girl', 'relationships', 'academic', 'cheating', 'said', 'Rowling', 'extensive', 'narrative', ""n't"", 'fit', 'so', 'comfortably', 'two-and-a-half', 'hour', 'running', 'time', 'Screenwriter', 'Steve', 'Kloves', 'get', 'most', 'work', 'prescribed', 'length', 'hard', 'see', 'point', 'invented', 'scenes', 'Harry', 'flirtation', 'muggle', 'girl', 'London', 'tube', 'station', 'when', 'screen-time', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'alloted', 'more', 'Rowling', 'own', 'ideas', '.Director', 'David', 'material', 'adroitly', 'style', 'feels', 'more', 'perfunctory', 'series', 'previous', 'directors', 'One', 'scene', 'particular', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'major', 'devastating', 'turning', 'point', 'Rowling', 'tale', 'dramatic', 'intensity', 'something', 'lead', 'balloon', 'film', 'technically', 'well-photographed', 'Bruno', 'Delbonnel', 'awash', 'low-key', 'shadowy', 'lighting', 'generally', 'drab', 'washed-out', 'colour', 'scheme', 'effective', 'spookier', 'moments', 'look', ""n't"", 'suit', 'scenes', 'intimacy', 'humor', 'cast', 'dreary', 'pall', 'film', 'Hooper', 'serviceable', 'score', 'too', 'lacklustre', 'compared', 'symphonic', 'grandeur', 'John', 'Williams', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'music.However', 'performers', 'are', 'usual', 'first', 'rate', 'established', 'cast', 'bring', 'ever-more', 'freshness', 'parts', 'newcomer', 'Hero', 'Fiennes-Tiffin', 'nephew', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'unnervingly', 'sinister', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'fine', 'Professor', 'Slughorn.Harry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'wonderful', 'story', 'results', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'Warner', 'Blu-ray', 'disc', 'excellent', 'transfer', 'crisp', 'detail', 'lack', 'epic', 'sweep', 'earlier', 'films', ""n't"", 'deliver', 'satisfying', 'emotional', 'payoff', 'so', 'one', 'less-enjoyable', 'Potter', 'adaptations']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I felt there was too much dialog & not enough action for one thing. Look at all the past HP movies, always a good blend of story with action. This movie was like a melodrama with minimal action. For 2&1/2 hours that you expect some long exciting wizardry action you get talk talk talk. I guess most of the budget went to paying off the cast. The only real exciting scenes were at the beginning where the villains known as the Dark Lords are flying around wrecking havoc and the ending with a death of a major character. There was a cool chase scene out in the field but it lead to nothing..There wasn't even some giant monster or beast or any giants to fight...just some dead people coming out of the water entrapping Harry Potter and Dumbledorff. It was on ok to good movie but just lacked that spark this time around. I felt this lacked a lot of action that made the first ones great.. What gives ?The only thing I can think of that this is the calm before the storm as obviously this set up the next 2 films which I hope will be full of action suspense & other fantasy elements that make these films so good.The story is to uncover the secrets of the Half Blood Prince, who is he, and to find the potion that uncovers the secrets of the prince. Lots of scenes of Harry's facial expressions, not enough scenes of action.Just who was the audience for this film ? Kids - I think not - they would get restless. Teenagers ? Again,bored & restless to the point where playing with their I-Phone becomes an alternative. Adults ? Some will get impatient waiting for something exciting to happen or have that expression of 2 & 1/2 of hardly anything happens in this movie.No it wasnt the worst film Ive seen this year, but it was the worst HP installment. It really needs the Chris Columbus touch, or someone who understands the Fantasy genre besides talk talk talk.It really says something when Public Enemies - a crime drama has more action than a fantasy film. That film and Star Trek were far better than HP.For me this movie didnt stand out - I made a list of where I felt it was with others of interest to me this year - it is a middle of the pack movie for me.Star TrekPublic EnemiesHarry Potter (a very distant 3rd I might add)Terminator SalvationGI JOETransformers Revenge of the FallenI love films and when I expect a movie that has delivered so many times in the past to fall way short I was very disappointed.

Skipping the less-than-thrilling details of this film, let us begin by looking at it purely cinematically. It is stark, dark, minimalist in every possible way, and it is a bit dank.I was going to say ""stale""--but I changed my mind.Those searching for the sparkle of Harry Potter films gone by will be sorely, sorely disappointed. I suspect the American writer's strike, occurring whilst this was in production, had something to do with it all. Also, there is a feel to the film of an unfinished, under-funded production.Yet that kind of thing is what the British have always carried off, magnificently.Leaving those unpleasantries behind, GET THIS 2-DISC edition while you can. The extras on disc two are fun and penetrating: we learn a great deal about J. K. Rowling in one documentary; in another, we learn some things about the cast. There are other nice little extras, which I won't spoil.The film is extremely well acted. The forces of the actors alone drive it along, compel us to sink deeply into the emotions of the film--despite the fact it was Rowling's worst novel out of the set. Daniel Radcliffe has matured quite well; Rupert Grint is as funny as Buster Keaton, somehow managing to elicit giggles even when he is dying after being poisoned. Emma Watson, as beautiful as ever, has also matured and deepened as an actress. In fact, there is a darkly humorous yet innocent undertone to the film, with some post-adolescent one-liners. BARELY post-adolescent, I warn you...it is supposedly a teen film.Great kudos especially to the great Jim Broadbent, recently of Indiana Jones fame, in the role of Professor Horace Slughorn. Broadbent has that rare, indescribable combination of talents in an actor that are too rarely seen--but when you watch Broadbent, you are watching a brand, well worth fan loyalty. It's a shame Broadbent hasn't a ""snowball's chance"" of an Oscar. He deserves one for this performance.The only others we see with any screen force are Alan Rickman as Snape, Tom Felton as Draco, Dame Maggie Smith as Professor MacGonagall and Sir Michael Gambon as the irrepressible Dumbledore. The big beef I have with the whole thing is the lack of other characters, and the old familiars that do crop up are like cardboard. For example, Robbie Coltrane as Haggrid gets about four minutes' screen time and few lines. Other characters, introduced for the first time in the novel, are nowhere in sight here. I am also rather disgusted with the last 15 or 20 minutes of the film...but I'll leave you to discover that disgust for yourselves.Get it and watch it: this film constitutes what is the very best and the very worst of Harry Potter film, and it is worth it for that alone.",4,"It was the Best of Harry, It was the WORST of Harry, but it was GOOD.",1260403200,"12 10, 2009",2009,2790,"['confess', 'had', 'give', 'one', 'second', 'intense', 'watching', 'truly', 'benefitted', 'Skipping', 'less-than-thrilling', 'details', 'film', 'let', 'begin', 'looking', 'purely', 'cinematically', 'stark', 'dark', 'minimalist', 'possible', 'way', 'bit', 'dank.I', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'stale', 'changed', 'mind.Those', 'searching', 'sparkle', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'gone', 'will', 'be', 'sorely', 'sorely', 'disappointed', 'suspect', 'American', 'writer', 'strike', 'occurring', 'whilst', 'was', 'production', 'had', 'something', 'do', 'Also', 'feel', 'film', 'unfinished', 'under-funded', 'production.Yet', 'kind', 'thing', 'what', 'British', 'have', 'always', 'carried', 'off', 'magnificently.Leaving', 'unpleasantries', 'behind', 'GET', 'THIS', '2-DISC', 'edition', 'can', 'extras', 'disc', 'two', 'are', 'fun', 'penetrating', 'learn', 'great', 'deal', 'J.', 'K.', 'Rowling', 'one', 'documentary', 'learn', 'things', 'cast', 'are', 'other', 'nice', 'little', 'extras', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil.The', 'film', 'extremely', 'well', 'acted', 'forces', 'actors', 'alone', 'drive', 'compel', 'sink', 'deeply', 'emotions', 'film', 'fact', 'was', 'Rowling', 'worst', 'novel', 'set', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'matured', 'quite', 'well', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'as', 'funny', 'Buster', 'Keaton', 'somehow', 'managing', 'elicit', 'giggles', 'even', 'when', 'dying', 'being', 'poisoned', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'as', 'beautiful', 'ever', 'also', 'matured', 'deepened', 'actress', 'fact', 'darkly', 'humorous', 'yet', 'innocent', 'undertone', 'film', 'post-adolescent', 'one-liners', 'BARELY', 'post-adolescent', 'warn', 'supposedly', 'teen', 'film.Great', 'kudos', 'especially', 'great', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'recently', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'fame', 'role', 'Professor', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'Broadbent', 'rare', 'indescribable', 'combination', 'talents', 'actor', 'are', 'too', 'rarely', 'seen', 'when', 'watch', 'Broadbent', 'are', 'watching', 'brand', 'well', 'worth', 'fan', 'loyalty', 'shame', 'Broadbent', ""n't"", 'snowball', 'chance', 'Oscar', 'one', 'performance.The', 'only', 'others', 'see', 'screen', 'force', 'are', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Draco', 'Dame', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'Professor', 'MacGonagall', 'Sir', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'irrepressible', 'Dumbledore', 'big', 'beef', 'have', 'whole', 'thing', 'lack', 'other', 'characters', 'old', 'familiars', 'do', 'crop', 'up', 'are', 'cardboard', 'example', 'Robbie', 'Coltrane', 'Haggrid', 'four', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'few', 'lines', 'Other', 'characters', 'introduced', 'first', 'time', 'novel', 'are', 'nowhere', 'sight', 'here', 'am', 'also', 'rather', 'disgusted', 'last', '15', '20', 'minutes', 'film', ""'ll"", 'leave', 'discover', 'disgust', 'yourselves.Get', 'watch', 'film', 'what', 'very', 'best', 'very', 'worst', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'alone']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

In the opening scene, it looks like he might get lucky, but then Dumbledore shows up with yet another mission.  This time it's to recruit Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to teach at Hogwarts.  The plot is the same essentially; as Voldemort tries once again to defeat Harry and fails. Throw in some Quidditch footage, wacky hormonal high jinks among the Hogwarts' student body, and some cool special effects, and there's your movie. Only Tom Felton as Draco has replaced Voldemort as the designated sneerer, which is good because he's a lot more photogenic.As reviewers have noted, you won't understand the title's meaning unless you've also read the book.

While this may be harmless, there are forces at work that are anything but.  The death eaters are growing in strength and becoming more vicious, killing several muggles in a terrorist attack.  Diagon Alley is all but deserted, only Fred and George Weasley's joke shop is thriving.  Hogwarts has increased security, incoming students are being searched and the entire school is surrounded by a magic force field.  Harry is recruited by Dumbledore to convince former Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as the new potions teacher.  The task proves simple.  Slughorn is eager to return to Hogwarts, particularly with Harry Potter as a potential student.  Harry will later be required to do things not so simple.  Dumbledore believes Slughorn has valuable information that could be used against Voldermort and hopes Harry can find it out.  Slughorn has taken a definite liking to Harry, who has become one of his better students.  Of course, Harry has some help.  He is using an old potion book with very accurate notes courtesy of ""the half-blood prince"" (whoever he is).  Unfortunately, there is danger.  Despite the security precautions, Dumbledore is the target of assassination attempts.  Harry suspects Draco may be up to something, he has already been seen with wanted criminals.  Later on, death eaters attack and burn the Weasley house to the ground.  Eventually, Harry gets Slughorn to give Dumbledore a memory that confirms Dumbledore's worst fears about Voldermort, and a way to destroy him!  Will Harry and Dumbledore be able to use Voldermort's own strength against him?  Will they uncover the truth about the assassination attempts?  Will they be able to survive a Trojan-horse style invasion of Hogwarts?Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince reminds me of the start of A Tale of Two Cities - ""It was the best of times, it was the worst times.""  In some ways this is one of the best Harry Potter films made.  In others, though, it lags.  The storyline involving Ron Weasley and quiddich could have easily been done away with, the teenage romance could have been reduced to a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, the movie resolves its teen angst portion in time to get back to the main plot.  That is why Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has been a success.

For one, the acting has not only retained its flawless level, but has risen to new heights! Snape was picked perfectly! The horcruxes, another factor as to why this film is so high in my esteem, are immensely clever! They also explain quite a bit! The reasons behind the power of Tom Riddle's diary and the ring are explained by the horcrux theory. The film starts and ends with a bang, too. {SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!} Dumbledore's death was particularly horrifying and touching; it was quite sad. Something I was glad to see was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione are growing up. Ron and Hermione's affection for each other is by now very obvious, and I, for one, will be immensely joyful when they get married. {ANOTHER SPOILER!} Malfoy appears quite a bit, doing unknown deeds, adding to the suspense of the film. The visuals are great, as always. The film's ending will leave you in shock, but will make you extremely impatient to see the 7th Harry Potter film! When I first saw the film, I was stuck to my seat the entire 153 minutes! I was quite glad quidditch matches were introduced again; I missed them. Slughorn was very funny, as was Hagrid. The inferi were very scary, and young Tom Riddle was chilling. Harry and his friends are becoming more and more real, human, and lovable with each film, and this is no exception. I still think Luna Lovegood steals the show, and wish she could have been in the Half Blood Prince even longer than she was! The identity of the Half Blood Prince was shocking!!!! In short, I thought the film could not be improved upon! I only wish it had been longer!

Nice special effects.Disjointed enough however that one MUST have seen all the previous movies and/or read the books to follow the plot....Most importantly, it bears little resemblance to the Harry Potter books!!!Really. I can forgive replacing the actions of one character with another character, to save time, I can even forgive eliminating whole chapters for the sake of brevity, but to change scenes, edit whole parts, and invent whole chapters???Beware, below, there be SPOILERS! Don't read if you haven't watched!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Some examples of lost scenes:-Dumbledore confronting the Dursley's? Gone.-The invention of a fight at the burrow, including the destruction of the whole house? Really? Where's Bill & Fleur going to get married next movie? (Oh that's right, in the movies, they AREN'T! Heck, they aren't even in -this- movie!)-The ""Meeting of the Ministers"" scene? Gone. Heck there's absolutely NO sign of Scrimgeour -anywhere- in the whole movie!-Tonks rescuing Harry from the train? Nope, now it's Luna, looking for Wrackspurts, and removing Harry's invisibility cloak with her wand. (As A Deathly Hallow, it should be immune to summoning and/or levitation charms.)-The slow build up leading to the Quiddich victory kiss? Gone. Now just a ""close your eyes"" peck in the Room of Requirement, and this was done horribly!!-The two months of Harry & Ginny dating? Gone.-Harry breaking up with Ginny to protect her? Gone!-Harry's ownership of Grimmauld Place and Kreacher? (Key for the next movie) Gone.-The Gaunt house flash-backs? Both gone. And with them any mention of Merope, Voldemort's mother. Gone too the mention of her locket by Caractacus Burke.-The memories of Hokey the house elf, and of Dumbledore's job interview with Voldemort? (Key for the next movie) Gone. In fact, all references to the valuable heirlooms such as Hufflepuff's cup are gone.-Crabb & Goyle polyjuiceing into girls to stand watch? (would have been funny, but...) Gone.-Snapes ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" lessons? Gone.-Apparition lessons and test? Gone.-Hermione & Ron's Prefect status? (Well, since it wasn't mentioned LAST film, why mention it now?)-Harry's appointment as Quiddich captain? (Not mentioned, only implied during the tryouts)-Mundungus stealing Sirius' property? (KEY for the next movie) Gone.-Snap's betrayal of Trelawney's prophecy to Voldemort? (HUGE!) Gone!!!-Harry petrified by Dumbledoor to protect him? GONE!-The Hogwarts battle between Death Eaters and Order members? (and Bill's disfigurement?) GONE!!-Dumbledore's funeral? GONE!!!!...oh sure, we'll probably get to see a few of the minor bits I've mentioned in the ""deleted scenes"" portion of the ""Deluxe"" version of the DVD, but for this screen version, We get such useless add-on scenes as:-All the trees around the burrow (HP 2/the flying car shot) have been cut down and replaced by a marsh?-Harry wandering the underground, and chatting up a waitress??-The aforementioned Burrow fight and subsequent burning??Not to mention, Harry NOT petrified, but willingly hiding and watching Dumbledore's assassination? (Does anyone besides me see how that fundamentally would change Harry's view of himself?) Yeash!And WHAT the heck was up with Jessie Cave/Lavender Brown? Worst acting since Brother Sun/Sister Moon! They tested 7000 girls, and they picked a 2nd rate ham?

1122079,A21M6XJHHBQSEC,B000ZECQ08,G. Kroener,"[14, 19]","First of all, I have to say, I love the Harry Potter series, the movies as much as the books. And until now, every movie brought the flair the books had adequately to the big screen, without losing the essential messages and story points.And now we have Half-Blood Prince.I was curious how the movie would start, given the various excellent options by Rowling. Maybe the ingenius visit of Dumbledore at the Dursleys? Or the thrilling scene with the Unbreakable Vow? None of those! Of course not! Who would like to have a classic Harry Potter scene as the opener of your movie? The screenwriters flexed their muscles and came up with a brilliant bit of Potter legend: Harry picking up a funky chick at a Diner!Now a simple question: here you have a book with 600 pages, and you actually choose to come up with THAT, thus bewildering the fans from the very first frame?I mean, come on! The book has more than enough teenage romance already, what is the damn point of making stuff up?And this does not remain the only major detour. Really, I have no objection to adding a few bits, as long as they are true to the story and the characters - but what on earth possessed Yates and Kloves to light the Burrow on fire?This attack by the Death Eaters is THE textbook example of pointless guff, since nothing happens. And it hurts all the more if you consider for a moment that they conceived that scene instead of filming Harry's conversation with Scrimgeour, the new minister of magic.But speaking of teenage romance, this was obviously a major part of the book, and honestly, it works better here than in textform. It is also quite logical that all the bickering and all the twists between Ron and Hermione, involving Ginny and Harry, simple can't be fleshed out, so consequently their row is not nearly as dramatic as in the book. In the book, Ron was first angry because he watched Ginny kissing Dean, which resulted in Ron being angry at Hermione because she kissed Victor Krum, which he wouldn't tell her, all of that causing Ron to go for Lavender Brown, and that finally pushed Hermione over the edge.It's already exhausting explaining it, can you blame Yates for not putting ALL that into the film?The sudden interest between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, feel like out of the blue, but the movie can't mend what the book did.What he substracted from the romance stories, he added to the Snape/Malfoy storyline. And I don't mean scenes, I mean additional layers. And those layers come dangerously close to compromising the point the book tries to make.To be perfectly clear: Severus Snape is a Death Eater, he always was, he only spied on Dumbledore. He has no remorse, no second doubt. He offers to make the Unbreakable Vow. He is a villain, pure and simple. That's what makes him killing Dumbledore dramatic.Here, in the film, Snape is pushed by Bellatrix to make the Vow, clearly indicating that he is a man in doubt, pushed to do it. That is wrong, simply.Plus, by saying verbatim that Katie was supposed to bring the cursed amulet to Dumbledore, by *showing* several times what Malfoy is doing in the Room Of Requirement, by already piecing the puzzle together along the way, the film lacks some surprise, since Dumbledore's death at the hand of Snape does not come as a shock like in the book, it is a natural consequence.And it isn't even handled properly.The whole point is that Dumbledore was poisened, weak. Hearing Death Eaters coming, he uses his last chance of defending himself to stun Harry, to protect him. And Snape has Dumbledore at his mercy, he is killing a poisened, defenseless man. The movie is not nearly brutal enough in that regard.And it does not even make the point explicitly that Dumbledore's trust in Snape was wrong.Rowling knew what she was writing in those crucial scenes, surely there is no point in completely rewriting it, implicating that it wasn't good.Why is it so hard for these people to follow simple rules? Cut parts that don't disturb the main story. Use editorial force if following the book word by word takes too long. Make the point the book is trying to make, even if you have to do it in a slightly different way. Don't leave out signature set pieces of the book.In short, Dumbledore's funeral is not there. That is a no-no. And unforgiveable if you ask me.And what is that stupid ceremony at the end anyway? All the students standing there, were they rehearsing that collective lightshow in case Dumbledore ever gets killed?The point is that things were changed for no reason. If you show Harry getting the memory from Slughorn by using Felix Felicis, the for god's sake do it like the book does, and not like THIS. They obviously didn't get the point that the potion causes coincidences leading to your goal.One other minus point is that Harry's lessons in Dumbledore's office seem to serve no reason. It's just presented like ""here is that little story I want to show you"".It is simply never explained why those memories are of any importance at all. If they wanted to set up the Horcrux storyline, then surely the story of the House Of Gaunt or the story of the cup and the locket would suit the case better than that short visit at the orphanage.The visuals are fine, and in fact very moody and atmospheric. It's just obscure to me why a large part of the movie is coloured with that greenish hue, and the only scene in the book that actually mentions the green light - in the cave - does not have it.The music is terrible. Truly horrid. A string ostinato here, and a string of chords there, that's all there's to it. It's not even atmospheric music, it's Nicholas Hooper desperately hitting random chords.Often I just thought ""he didn't score THIS?""Some pieces from the album are not there, and during the Quidditch tryouts, the original score, whatever it was, was replaced by Order of the Phoenix music.All in all, if you have never read the book, you might enjoy this as much as the other films, but if you read it, prepare to not be overwhelmed.",3,Missed opportunities galore!,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,6016,"['First', 'have', 'say', 'love', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'movies', 'as', 'much', 'books',

The whole issue of the horcruxes was handled well enough as were the romances and Malfoy's angst over having been ordered to kill Dumbledore. I'm a little hazy on why they burned down the Burrow. Maybe to highlight Molly's growing fear of losing her husband or one of the kids but it seems to me they could have done that without the pyro.That said I do have a couple of issues to vent. The editing was choppy at best. Certain conversations such as Dumbledore/Riddle at the orphanage seemed to have been cut and reassembled in a sloppy manner. It didn't sound natural. My other complaint lies with the omission of the memory dealing with the cup and locket. They're going to have to find a way for them to discover the existence of the cup in the last two movies although it seems to me it could have been handled here in about 90 seconds. Perhaps they're uncomfortable with the CGI of elves.Anyway I'm not as big a fanatic as a lot of other reviewers so I'm not as easily frustrated. I started collecting these because of my daughter and have only read the last 3 books. She was 10 at the time and we've seen every episode in the theater since the first one.

1122087,A2N3N439PRGV3I,B000ZECQ08,Gregory Bravo,"[1, 8]","After the utter disaster that was the Clif's Notes movie version of ""Harry Potter and The Order of the Phoenix"" (see my review for that film), I was filled with very great trepidation that this series was entirely doomed.  I went into the theater half expecting that David Yates and Co. would butcher yet another great book.I must admit that I was wrong.""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a good movie!There is a lot to like about this film, and the criticisms I have are relatively minor.Before I discuss details, I'll say this, though:  What is most important is that they got the FEEL of the book right.  There is emotion here, thank goodness!  Laughter, sadness, romance.  Wonderful!  Thank you, Steve Kloves, for writing a good screenplay!  Welcome back!  (Kloves was the screenwriter for every HP movie other than OOTP.)Now, down to the details...  (I'll put in here *SPOILER ALERT*, but you kinda should expect that.)Every time a book is converted into a movie, the two main criticisms that lovers of the book have are ones of omission and commission.  That is, the moviemakers either leave out beloved scenes, or choose to add their own scenes that AREN'T in the book.  Being somewhat of a purist myself, I usually prefer that the movie stick as closely to the book as possible, like Lord of the Rings mostly did.  However, a movie is a movie and a book is a book---so the real question in my mind is whether or not the omissions and commissions are basically positive and make a good film.OOTP did both of these things badly-- it left out really important stuff, and the stuff it added was just bad.HBP mostly did both of these things well-- it left in most of the important stuff, and (other than one thing) added mostly good additional scenes.The movie begins with Death Eaters wreaking havoc in Muggle London, and Harry Potter putting the moves on a pretty Muggle waitress.  There is no meeting with the Muggle Prime Minister, like in the book.  (I'm fine with that--- you have to cut SOMETHING.)  Things are looking bad.Harry and Dumbledore visit a potential new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn. Harry manages to convince him to come back to Hogwarts--- as he learns later, because has something that Dumbledore wants, and he thinks Harry can get it from him.From there, the movie pretty much follows the plot of the book fairly closely.  Most well-loved scenes from the book are here--- some done better than others, but all are mostly OK.One thing that the screenwriters added that I think was actually an IMPROVEMENT over the book is that they flesh out the budding romance between Harry and Ginny, and between Ron and Hermione. (To be honest, in my opinion the relationship between Harry and Ginny wasn't given enough development in the books-- one of the few criticisms I had of the books.)  These additional scenes are really done well.  They are heartfelt and subtle, not cheesy at all.  I really loved the scene on the stairs where Harry and Hermione comfort each other because each is in love with someone who is currently with someone else.I won't parse the rest of the film, since everyone basically knows the plot.  But most things are done well.Now, onto my several minor criticisms.First of all, the filmmakers added a scene which I felt was gratuitous and stupid, and which added nothing to the story at all.  In one scene the Death Eaters attack The Burrow and destroy it.  That was just needless and heartless.  The Burrow was the one place where Harry could feel safe, and to destroy it felt like a kick in the gut for no reason.  You know, as long as there is a Shire to go back to, there is always something to fight for.  To destroy the Burrow-- the one place Harry felt most at home--- was a serious misstep as far as I'm concerned, because it just made the whole endeavor now feel hopeless.  Seriously, WHY DO THIS???  This was the one major mistake I feel the filmmakers made.A couple other minor criticisms are that I felt that the movie Slughorn could have been a little sluggier and and little more pompous.  The movie version was a little too normal for my liking.  Not horrible, still pretty good--- but not great, and not as memorable as the book.Another thing I think might have been better was the actor who played the teenage Voldemort.  I was a great fan of the actor Christian Coulson who played Tom Riddle in Chamber of Secrets.  He got the teenage Tom Riddle down perfectly--- charismatic, enigmatic, charming, with just a touch of an undercurrent of danger--- and TOTALLY memorable.  The young actor who plays Tom Riddle in this film plays him more creepy, less human, and entirely less charming, charismatic and memorable.  He plays him like those creepy kids who roam the hallways in The Shining--- and kind of looks like them too.One other things I was a tad bit disappointed in was that the Great Hall in this film is not as great as those in the other films---- I don't know how they did it, but this Great Hall is much SMALLER!However, let me reemphasize:Other than those minor complaints, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a GOOD movie, with heart, feeling, romance, action and intrigue.  A worthy contribution to the HP movie canon.Enjoy!",4,"""It's Good!"" he says with a GREAT sigh of relief...",1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,5217,"['utter', 'disaster', 'was', 'Clif', 'Notes', 'movie',

1122094,A29UO9GBSQXS72,B000ZECQ08,Horror Spooky,"[4, 12]","Out of all the Harry Potter films so far, Half-Blood Prince is my favorite. Why? Well, for one, it is a brilliantly well done film that once again allows the amazing acting to really shine through, and it also throws in subtle references to the previous films in the series as well as different pieces of plot from the books. Half-Blood Prince has it all: humor, style, flawless special effects, great acting, and a plot that is more powerful than any plot told in the films to date.The villains are especially impressive, and they give performances that are absolutely memorable and chilling all at once. The teenage angst presented by our lovable protagonists is relatable and just as interesting to watch as the cool fight scenes are. Yes, this Potter film does it all in a way that will dazzle, amaze, and astound you.This film takes place directly after Order of the Phoenix left off, with good 'ole Harry still recovering from his battle with Lord Voldemort. However, he is called back by Albus Dumbledore to aid in a mission to find out more about Voldemort's dark past and to try to stop the evil from becoming as powerful as it had been years ago. Trust me, by the end of the movie, your heart will be wrenched with emotions and your jaw will be slammed through the floorboards. It's really that good.Everything from the editing to the special effects were done well, and done in a way so that they make you feel exactly what the director had intended you to feel. There are even some pretty jarring thrills sprinkled in with the happy-go-lucky moments and sweet smiles that the film will give you, plus it's laugh out loud funny and jump out of your seat terrifying all at once. This truly is a film for the ages.The special effects, an area that has really bothered me in previous Potter films, have really been improved with this installment. The use of CGI is even less so than it was in the films prior to Half-Blood Prince, which is a god-send, and the CGI that is used doesn't look as ugly and is rarely the main focus of the screen. The characters become more fleshed out and the stage is set for the grand finale that we will experience within the next couple of years.Without a doubt, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a film EVERYONE has to see.

Like countless others, I was enchanted by its masterful realization of rich archetypal symbolism drawn from a combination of classic British culture and the world of magic.  It was a movie that simply had to be made.But the subsequent movies have merely attempted to recycle the ingredients from the original, letting them become increasingly stale in the process while adding no worthwhile new elements.  Moreover, instead of being buoyantly magical, the movies have become rather dark, not just in their plot and characters, but even visually, with the original vivid colors now looking faded as though all the events took place at dusk.This latest movie exemplifies these weaknesses.  The characters are now stereotyped and flat, the plot is unconvincing and doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the overall emotional range is stunted and narrow.  If they wanted to give up on making a good movie and instead just cash in on their lucrative franchise by resorting to fear and cool special effects, they didn't even accomplish that.  The special effects fell short of the previous movies (lowering cost to increase profit?) and boredom was the main effect I experienced.  I had to struggle just to stay awake.

Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague Horace Slughorn, who he believes holds crucial information. Even as the decisive showdown looms, romance blossoms for Harry, Ron, Hermione and their classmates. Love is in the air, but danger lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

But with movies that I have read the book or comic, I don't go into it with the expectation that it will be the book to the letter. You need to go to movies for what they are, entertainment, and try to go and just enjoy them. Unless you are a movie critic, why go so crazy when they didn't make it the way you wanted. These movies are good movies. Film makers will change things from the book to make the movie flow more. Do you realize how long these movies would be if they followed the books to the letter. It would be like ""Gettysburg"" or ""Gods and Generals"", which are 4 to 6 hour movies. They were and are great movies, but they are not the best for theaters because of their length.

1122107,A2OU415LB9I5J6,B000ZECQ08,Jason C. Wilkerson,"[2, 2]","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince begins on a real somber note. The opening scene, only mentioned but not described in the book, shows Death Eaters causing the destruction of a massive bridge filled with people. What makes this scene unique compared to the rest of the series is that this destruction takes place in the muggle world, not the wizarding one. David Yates, directing his second Harry Potter film, takes great pains to show that there are no safe places now that Voldemort is back and his followers are out in the open. Even some places that were safe havens for Harry in the past, namely the Weasley residence and even Hogwarts itself, are besieged by Death Eaters.However, the danger surrounding the characters at every turn doesn't keep the teen characters from being teens. Hormones run high through Hogwarts as students pair off and young love blooms. Things may be dark, but in the world of Harry Potter there will always be some light shining through. While some people complained that there was too much young love in this film, I have to admit that I found it interesting that more than ever this film really gave an impression that the teens in Harry Potter are just ordinary (well, for wizards) kids who happen to find themselves in extraordinary situations. As a result, this film is not only the darkest film of the series, it's also the funniest.While rumors swirled that some cast members would not find their way back for the sixth Potter film (Emma Watson was considering dropping out and Tom Felton, who plays Draco Malfoy, had previously made comments that he would not make it to the end of the series), the cast remained intact for Half Blood Prince. Nine years and six films is a long time for a cast to stay together, especially when they're as young as most of this cast was when the series began, so the fact that they're still together is beyond amazing.The Harry Potter team continues its casting coup in Half Blood Prince. Royal Shakespeare Company veteran Helen McCrory (Becoming Jane, Enduring Love), who was initially cast as Bellatrix LeStrange in Order of the Phoenix but had to drop out due to pregnancy, joins the cast as Lestrange's sister Narcissa Malfoy. The cast member that everyone was talking about, though, was Oscar winner Jim Broadbent (Iris, Hot Fuzz) as Horace Slughorn. At the time of Half Blood Prince's release everyone expected Broadbent to get at least a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and, while he didn't get nominated, he delivered the best performance the series has known. In fact, all the actors in the series give their best performance to date in this film. Even Michael Gambon finally gets Dumbledore right!It's also great to see Quidditch back in the series after being noticeably absent from the last two films and just barely present in Prisoner of Azkaban. The sequences are shot better than in the first two films, and depict the game as much more brutal, having more in common with rugby than it appeared to before. The addition of Ron to Gryffindor's team is brilliant. I'm also glad that we get to see more of Alan Rickman's Severus Snape than in previous installments. In Goblet of Fire, besides a few speaking lines, he was relegated to a moment of physical comedy with Harry and Ron, and he was barely present in Order of the Phoenix.While Half Blood Prince didn't quite catch up to Order of the Phoenix in box office receipts, it's still the third-highest grossing film in the series and was the second-highest grossing film of 2009 with $936 million earned worldwide. According to Rotten Tomatoes, this installment of Harry Potter is ranked the third highest, critically-speaking. It seems a lot of critics felt as though this film worked more as a placeholder in the series than as a standalone film. That criticism isn't too far from the truth, yet J.K. Rowling said that this is the best film based on her books yet.",5,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,1290556800,"11 24, 2010",2010,3917,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'real', 'somber', 'note', 'opening', 'scene', 'only', 'mentioned', 'not', 'described', 'book', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'causing', 'destruction', 'massive', 'bridge', 'filled', 'people', 'What', 'scene', 'unique', 'compared', 'rest', 'series', 'destruction', 'place', 'muggle', 'world', 'not', 'wizarding', 'one', 'David', 'Yates', 'directing', 'second', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'great', 'pains', 'show', 'are', 'safe', 'places', 'now', 'Voldemort', 'back', 'followers', 'are', 'out', 'open', 'Even', 'places', 'were', 'safe', 'havens', 'Harry', 'past', 'namely', 'Weasley', 'residence', 'even', 'Hogwarts', 'are', 'besieged', 'Death', 'Eaters.However', 'danger', 'surrounding', 'characters', 'turn', ""n't"", 'keep', 'teen', 'characters', 'being', 'teens', 'Hormones', 'run', 'high', 'through', 'Hogwarts', 'students', 'pair', 'young', 'love', 'blooms', 'Things', 'may', 'be', 'dark', 'world', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'light', 'shining', 'people', 'complained', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'young', 'love', 'film', 'have', 'admit', 'found', 'interesting', 'more', 'ever', 'film', 'really', 'gave', 'impression', 'teens', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'are', 'just', 'ordinary', 'well', 'wizards', 'kids', 'who', 'happen', 'find', 'extraordinary', 'situations', 'result', 'film', 'not', 'only', 'darkest', 'film', 'series', 'also', 'funniest.While', 'rumors', 'swirled', 'cast', 'members', 'would', 'not', 'find', 'way', 'back', 'sixth', 'Potter', 'film', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'was', 'considering', 'dropping', 'out', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'who', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'had', 'previously', 'made', 'comments', 'would', 'not', 'make', 'end', 'series', 'cast', 'remained', 'intact', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'Nine', 'years', 'six', 'films', 'long', 'time', 'cast', 'stay', 'together', 'especially', 'when', ""'re"", 'as', 'young', 'most', 'cast', 'was', 'when', 'series', 'began', 'fact', ""'re"", 'still', 'together', 'amazing.The', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'team', 'casting', 'coup', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'Royal', 'Shakespeare', 'Company', 'veteran', 'Helen', 'McCrory', 'Becoming', 'Jane', 'Enduring', 'Love', 'who', 'was', 'initially', 'cast', 'Bellatrix', 'LeStrange', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'had', 'drop', 'out', 'due', 'pregnancy', 'cast', 'Lestrange', 'sister', 'Narcissa', 'Malfoy', 'cast', 'member', 'everyone', 'was', 'talking', 'was', 'Oscar', 'winner', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Iris', 'Hot', 'Fuzz', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'time', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'release', 'everyone', 'expected', 'Broadbent', 'get', 'least', 'nomination', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actor', 'did', ""n't"", 'get', 'nominated', 'delivered', 'best', 'performance', 'series', 'known', 'fact', 'actors', 'series', 'give', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'film', 'Even', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'finally', 'Dumbledore', 'right', 'also', 'great', 'see', 'Quidditch', 'back', 'series', 'being', 'noticeably', 'absent', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'just', 'barely', 'present', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'sequences', 'are', 'shot', 'better', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'depict', 'game', 'much', 'more', 'brutal', 'having', 'more', 'common', 'rugby', 'appeared', 'addition', 'Ron', 'Gryffindor', 'team', 'brilliant', ""'m"", 'also', 'glad', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'previous', 'installments', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'few', 'speaking', 'lines', 'was', 'relegated', 'moment', 'physical', 'comedy', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'was', 'barely', 'present', 'Order', 'Phoenix.While', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'catch', 'up', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'box', 'office', 'receipts', 'still', 'third-highest', 'grossing', 'film', 'series', 'was', 'second-highest', 'grossing', 'film', '2009', '936', 'million', 'earned', 'worldwide', 'According', 'Rotten', 'Tomatoes', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'ranked', 'third', 'highest', 'critically-speaking', 'lot', 'critics', 'felt', 'film', 'worked', 'more', 'placeholder', 'series', 'standalone', 'film', 'criticism', ""n't"", 'too', 'far', 'truth', 'yet', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'said', 'best', 'film', 'based', 'books', 'yet']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Well, let me tell you, it must be senility, because he's the only one who hasn't noticed.  With Harry's five o'clock shadow and the clear growth shared by Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ronald (Rupert Grint), I half expected a McLovin fake ID subplot.  Either they've extended eligibility by red-shirting a year, or they failed a grade, but at this point they've been attending school longer than anyone except Radio.As for the movie itself, it's stuck in a Twilight impersonation, with the aging trio gaining more experience with teen angst than wizardy.  Unfortunately, the threesome hasn't mastered an anti-aging spell yet, and they wander the halls of Hogwarts looking like the creepy old guy at the club, clearly years older than everyone else, and awkwardly out of place.Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the pseudo-albino antagonist, is busy growing up into someone who looks like a Die Hard villain; which is ironic considering Professor Snape is played by Alan Rickman, a man who was the original Die Hard enemy for John McClane.  Add David Thewlis as Professor Lupin and the evil Euro-trifecta is complete.Still battling the legacy of Voldermort is the key issue, with a few of his lackeys - most notably Helena Bonham Carter looking horrible - taking people away, killing others, and causing havoc.  There are also several fanciful potions and concoctions throughout, as Harry, Ron, and Dumbledore end up with reactions similar to the side affects of LSD, Ecstasy, and Meth, respectively.  Both are only minimal side stories, however, because the main point is to introduce drama and relationships into this edition, and inexplicably make a cute blonde like that red-headed train-wreck Ronald, not to mention Hermione's baffling attraction to him.  Too much of the plot was sacrificed, and too many holes are filled in by teen romance.This is by far the worst of the Harry Potter series.  There are some great sci-fi scenes, wonderful special effects, competent acting, and some incredibly dark imagery.  It's a joy to watch most of the time, but some aspects of the plot are ridiculously lacking (e.g. Dumbledore can turn back time, but nobody can stop a fire?).  Additionally the kids, scratch that, adults, shouldn't be in Hogwarts anymore; they're a little long in the tooth.  Harry and his sycophants should be serving as adjunct faculty at this point, not taking ""Advanced Potions.""

It is by far the best of the series.Anyone who has written a review or will write a review bashing this movie because it isn't just like the book, need to take a step back. If you don't go to these movies expecting big changes, then you, my friend are a complete idiot.Think of them as two entirely different entities, because they are. If they tried to copy all of the brilliant novel into the movie, it would be a complete mess. Books are beautiful and can take the time to develop smaller story threads and secondary characters, but movies don't have that luxury. They have to be more focused on main characters and the main plot line.For example, one reviewer was barking mad because the Dumbledore withered hand story thread was, as he put it, ""glossed over"". No offense, but it is pretty glossed over in the book as well. It is mentioned more, but you don't really find out the whole story about it until the seventh book anyway, so why waste screen time on it.I love the books. They are the most outstanding read on my book shelf, and I continue to pour through them over and over. The books are better than the movies, but then again, when isn't that true???? The books are always better than the movies!!!!! That doesn't mean that the movies can't be enjoyed and loved for what they are.I for one, admire what the screen writers do. I would hate to try and condense JK's brilliant novels into workable screen scripts.In short, don't be a moron. Love the books and then go see the movies and love them too!!! You can love both. Just remember they aren't going to be the same!!! If you don't, you are robbing yourself of the pleasure of enjoying some great cinema, BASED ON a bloody brilliant set of books.",5,Awesome!!

1122116,A1RSXP7MB772E3,B000ZECQ08,"Jeff W. Shimkus ""Movie Manji""","[1, 4]","This movie has many strengths. The actor performing as Dumbledore is very, very good. The way this movie proceeds near the end sent chills down my spine. I was by no means prepared for some of the dark turns this movie took me. I was holding my breath with suspense during some parts of this powerfully gripping movie!The half-blood prince is filmed in a chocolately, grainy lense, and other lenses that look take on the look of low lighting, which some digital camera's seem to have trouble filming-at least in the theater I watched. But the visuals are historic, and well appropriate for the castle, brick, and flags feel of the entire saga. Which hightens what the fans of the franchise treasure, that is the oxfordian, professor, teacher, feel that we from the public schools, really haven't been exposed to much.Not really until college, did I have something to gain an appreciation for the kind of style and archetecture of these kinds of movies. And it is appealing, and otherworldly, but once you are use to the accents and extravagance of the heavy curtained, fireplace halls, with echoing chambers, you have a story here, that is half told, and sometimes very confusing, and almost untranslatable without the novels. I felt, in the dark, by not having read the novels. I am dumped into these films without any context. It is always, ""Harry siting on a swing, and then school becons him where all sorts of dangers find him."" But in saying that, I do have a feel for the direction of the ultimate story, even though the small morsels, and finer details always allude me. And I give credit, also, to the young actors, who always exhibit the needed grittiness, and students in danger, that is required for me to enjoy these films.The special effects are another strength to the half-blood prince. All of the Harry Potter movies are feasts for the eyes and this one is magical as well. I'm looking forward to the DVD release of this one to enjoy watching it again. The weaknesses of this film are some of the performances by the role characters. Some of the young love bird scenes were creepy and clumsily awkard. But I think this movie is overall above average, with the some moments just spectacular.I did feel that the music did well here. I enjoyed the scenes of high action, and thought that the music (when used) played to its strengths and really added that finishing touch that only big companies can deliver. The now classic battle between the aged wizards near the ending was epic, and made this movie a solid classic.

1122117,ACEA95FQS1AVP,B000ZECQ08,Jem,"[4, 10]","Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. As it compares to the other films, it was better than some but not the best. B+  Mainly because I think the changes they made to the climax weren't as good as the original material.Unlike some fans of the books, I don't automatically think ""sacrilege!"" when material is cut from the book to make the film. Mostly I agree. I think the storyline with Hagrid and his giant brother from Phoenix was fluff in the book and so not needed in the film. Occasionally I disagree. I wasn't too thrilled that they cut Hermione's clever besting of Rita Skeeter in Goblet, but could see why the filmmakers did so - that would have added more time to an already long movie. Film is a different medium for story-telling and I enjoy it on its own merits. But, the cuts/changes they made to ""Half-Blood Prince"" just didn't seem necessary to me.I'm not talking about the majority of the film (or the fact that the title BARELY got an explanation). My criticism stems from the climactic death scene at the end. STOP HERE IF YOU DON'T ALREADY KNOW WHO DIED! In the book, Dumbledore and Harry return from their mission to find the school under attack from Death Eaters. Dumbledore's Army is holding them off, with some help from a luck potion, until the Order of the Phoenix can arrive to back them up. This was completely cut. We don't get to see the kids in action, which was a big disappointment and made the arrival of the Death Eaters an after-thought. I didn't feel any particular menace or surprise that they were in the school. Then, on top of the tower, Dumbledore has Harry hide under his invisibility cloak and then paralyzes him there. Not so in the film. Harry hides underneath the stairs and ""valiantly"" manages to restrain himself from coming to Dumbledore's aid (which doesn't jive with his character). Then, Dumbledore confronts Draco AND the Death Eaters. They weren't in this scene! I love Bellatrix's character, but it seemed they changed the scene just so she could be in it. It didn't work. Rowling's original set-up was superior. Had they kept it, this would easily have been the best HP film.Despite this, I did enjoy the movie a lot. Prince, as the penultimate novel, was really more of staging point/set-up for the finale, so it didn't have as much action as the other books, or films. It did have a lot of character development though. The film provoked much more laughter than any other HP film, and still captured the spirit of the book very well. I cried when he died, so I obviously felt connected to the characters, as intended.  This movie was quite good, and I will buy it on DVD so I can watch it again, but it also could have been that much better.",4,"Not the best HP film, far from worst",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,2699,"['Overall', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'other', 'films', 'was', 'better', 'not', 'best', 'B+', 'Mainly', 'think', 'changes', 'made', 'climax', 'were', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'original', 'material.Unlike', 'fans', 'books', 'do', ""n't"", 'automatically', 'think', 'sacrilege', 'when', 'material', 'cut', 'book', 'make', 'film', 'Mostly', 'agree', 'think', 'storyline', 'Hagrid', 'giant', 'brother', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'fluff', 'book', 'so', 'not', 'needed', 'film', 'Occasionally', 'disagree', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'thrilled', 'cut', 'Hermione', 'clever', 'besting', 'Rita', 'Skeeter', 'Goblet', 'could', 'see', 'why', 'filmmakers', 'did', 'so', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'more', 'time', 'already', 'long', 'movie', 'Film', 'different', 'medium', 'story-telling', 'enjoy', 'own', 'merits', 'cuts/changes', 'made', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'necessary', 'me.I', ""'m"", 'not', 'talking', 'majority', 'film', 'fact', 'title', 'BARELY', 'got', 'explanation', 'criticism', 'climactic', 'death', 'scene', 'end', 'STOP', 'HERE', 'IF', 'YOU', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'ALREADY', 'KNOW', 'WHO', 'DIED', 'book', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'return', 'mission', 'find', 'school', 'attack', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'Dumbledore', 'Army', 'holding', 'off', 'help', 'luck', 'potion', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'can', 'arrive', 'back', 'up', 'was', 'completely', 'cut', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'see', 'kids', 'action', 'was', 'big', 'disappointment', 'made', 'arrival', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'after-thought', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'particular', 'menace', 'surprise', 'were', 'school', 'Then', 'top', 'tower', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'hide', 'invisibility', 'cloak', 'then', 'there', 'Not', 'so', 'film', 'Harry', 'stairs', 'valiantly', 'restrain', 'coming', 'Dumbledore', 'aid', ""n't"", 'jive', 'character', 'Then', 'Dumbledore', 'confronts', 'Draco', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'were', ""n't"", 'scene', 'love', 'Bellatrix', 'character', 'seemed', 'changed', 'scene', 'just', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'Rowling', 'original', 'set-up', 'was', 'superior', 'Had', 'kept', 'would', 'easily', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'HP', 'film.Despite', 'did', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'lot', 'Prince', 'penultimate', 'novel', 'was', 'really', 'more', 'staging', 'point/set-up', 'finale', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'as', 'much', 'action', 'other', 'books', 'films', 'did', 'have', 'lot', 'character', 'development', 'film', 'provoked', 'much', 'more', 'laughter', 'other', 'HP', 'film', 'still', 'captured', 'spirit', 'book', 'very', 'well', 'cried', 'when', 'died', 'obviously', 'felt', 'connected', 'characters', 'intended', 'movie', 'was', 'quite', 'good', 'will', 'buy', 'DVD', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'also', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a &#34;young adult/kid&#34; series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told.

The pacing is also different - books can read at the pace of the reader; movies are watched in one sitting.I have read the book but it was five years ago when it came out. Frankly, I wouldn't be the best person to ask how well the movie follows the book. I do think the movie captures the essence of the book quite well. The major themes of the book seem to all be there. I think it's only fair to judge the movie by how well it succeeds as a movie.The movie (like the book) has the difficult task of setting up the grand finale while being entertaining in its own right. This it does brilliantly. New cast member Jim Broadbent is outstanding as the inherently decent but weak Horace Slughorn. The returning cast are also at the top of their game. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy really shines here. He plays the anguished and conflicted Draco Malfoy for all it's worth. Draco seems to be a lot more sympathetic here than in the book. This is no doubt the filmmaker's intention; we'll have to wait to see how this plays out. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore is also great. The ""three"" effortlessly handle their roles. Radcliffe and Grint are especially good when ""under the influence"".The only reservation I have about recommending this movie is that the previous five installments should be watched to get the full impact of the film.

A used potions book of someone named the Half Blood Prince helps Harry to impress Slughorn and get closer to him. But who's the Half Blood Prince ?While Hermione starts to show her true feelings for Ron when he starts dating someone. But he's too clueless to realize she's jealous. He also joins the Quiditch team, but he isn't as bad as he is in the book, but with some help from Harry and Hermione.

While Harry knows Draco is up to something which leads him into more than one confrontation with him.I loved the first half of the movie but once it got towards the end, it felt a bit rushed. The Deatheater's battle with Hogwart students from the book was left out when I was looking forward to it. While Bill Weasley I think was totally cut out of the movies. The drama between Persey and his family was also left out. I think the movies would have been stronger if didn't leave out such things though.I liked how the Weaseley mom didn't like Bill's future wife in the book, which led to a good moment in the end. Here, all that was totally left out.I liked a lot about the movie though. I originally said that the Harry and Ginny scenes could have been better. Now that I think about it, I loved the scene where Ginny runs to help Harry in a fight with Deatheaters. The flashbacks of Voldermort as a child were also good. While the director David Yates is good at handling the dark side of the story as well as the humor and magic. He's one of the better Potter directors even if he does cut out some things. A lot of people want Chris Columbus back for the last film but he's lucky if he's hired to do a made for dvd Home Alone sequel after doing (I Love You Beth Cooper).

I was SO looking forward to the world cup in the beginning, it really set the stage for the rest of the book) I think they slaughtered this one, the fifth wasn't as true as it could have been but it was also one of the most boring books in the series IMO so it was bittersweet, the sixth is probably my second favorite honestly though it too lacked a lot of information that I feel was needed to go into the seventh book.We book nerds have to realize they can't do it 100% perfect and have take it with a grain of salt, but that doesn't mean we can't pause the movie and fill in the blanks or tell it how it should be!!",4,Great Movie for Non-Book-Readers,1261353600,"12 21, 2009",2009,1558,"['Being', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'first', 'two', 'movies', 'then', 'moving', 'books', 'have', 'say', 'am', 'fan', 'books', 'first', 'movies', 'second', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'great', 'only', 'way', 'get', 'Potter', 'Geek', 'being', 'said', 'book', 'readers', 'have', 'realize', 'way', 'be', '100', '%', 'true', 'books', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'expensive', 'do', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'have', 'creative', 'license', 'have', 'draw', 'people', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'theater', 'am', 'also', 'one', 'haters', 'get', 'so', 'mad', 'when', 'something', 'was', 'changed', 'completely', 'not', 'even', 'movie', 'IMO', 'should', 'have', 'been.The', 'first', 'movie', 'still', 'favorite', 'second', 'one', 'felt', 'was', 'bit', 'boring', 'third', 'was', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'considering', 'fourth', 'kept', 'high', 'almost', 'whole', 'time', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'how', 'much', 'left', 'out', 'hell-O', 'was', 'SO', 'looking', 'forward', 'world', 'cup', 'beginning', 'really', 'set', 'stage', 'rest', 'book', 'think', 'slaughtered', 'one', 'fifth', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'true', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'was', 'also', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'books', 'series', 'IMO', 'was', 'bittersweet', 'sixth', 'probably', 'second', 'favorite', 'honestly', 'too', 'lacked', 'lot', 'information', 'feel', 'was', 'needed', 'go', 'seventh', 'book.We', 'book', 'nerds', 'have', 'realize', 'ca', ""n't"", 'do', '100', '%', 'perfect', 'have', 'take', 'grain', 'salt', ""n't"", 'mean', 'ca', ""n't"", 'pause', 'movie', 'fill', 'blanks', 'tell', 'how', 'should', 'be']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Let us forget that this is a hugely popular hit series in book and movie form as a stand alone film I felt robbed of my money and my time. I will not spoil anything, but understand this, MAJOR plot points are just skipped. If they made the movie for people that read the books and knew what was going on, and didn't really want to see the things happen on the big screen, the succeeded. This huge failure succeeds at making me want to get rid of the entire series it is so horrible. Major scenes were missing, and one major event was made to be so lack-luster, that I actually laughed out loud. When the film was over, my wife even went, ""That's it?"" Yes dear, that is the end of 2 and 1/2 hours of the worst rendition of a book to film. Now, do not tell me how movies and books differ, I understand that. But to complete omit major story points is completely unforgivable. And, if you are going to give me 150 minutes of film, do not add things that are not in the story and have nothing to do with the series. Actually, one complete waste of celluloid contradicts the series in a 5 minutes fight scene that is, well, not there in the books. The added scene even creates an issue for the next film. I had to explain everything that ""really"" happened to my wife, who was left completely clueless as to what was going on because this film says nothing about the real story. Just because it says Harry Potter, do not think that the entire world is going to invest their monies into your product. Stephen King made that mistake with his Dark Tower series.

1122132,A2TUA4VWCMNXI,B000ZECQ08,John D. Cofield,"[5, 13]","I was highly impressed and very relieved by my first viewing of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.  Impressed because the film is a fine adaptation of the book while relieved that the unfortunate skimping of detail which so marred Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was not as apparent.  The Harry Potter series is a rare exception to the rule that sequels are never as good as the originals.Naturally any book with as many subplots and characters as Half Blood Prince cannot be completely transferred to film  Some things are cut, like the Dursleys, while others are added, as in an early scene showing Harry at a Muggle diner.  What was cut did not mar the story and the additions were mostly in keeping with the overall tone.  Dark times have come to the wizard world.  Voldemort is extending his power, and even Muggles recognize that dark forces are at work.  Harry is now recognized by his fellow wizards as The Chosen One, and as a typical 16 year old it has gone to his head a bit.  He is torn between his need to be a teenager dealing with his emotions and those of his friends and would be lovers and his inescapable fate as the nemesis of the Dark Lord.In The Half Blood Prince we learn more about the early history of Lord Voldemort, and these scenes are among the best in the film, showing young Tom Riddle in a Muggle orphanage and later as the most gifted and troubled student at Hogwarts.  We get some hints of what is to come in the final Deathly Hallows movies, but not so much that those who have not yet read the last book will have that experience ruined.  Though the overall tone is dark, there are some supremely hilarious moments, mainly dealing with Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione's personal lives, as well as a very well portrayed Horace Slughorn.  The returning cast members continue to do remarkable job and we get more insights into some of their characters, particularly those of Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape.The film is greatly enhanced by its fine soundtrack, some of it carryovers from  earlier films (like the overall theme music) including a couple of my favorites from The Order of the Phoenix: Fireworks and Dumbledore's Army.",5,Darkly Magnificent,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,2178,"['was', 'highly', 'impressed', 'very', 'relieved', 'first', 'viewing', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'Impressed', 'film', 'fine', 'adaptation', 'book', 'relieved', 'unfortunate', 'skimping', 'detail', 'so', 'marred', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'was', 'not', 'apparent', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'rare', 'exception', 'rule', 'sequels', 'are', 'never', 'as', 'good', 'originals.Naturally', 'book', 'many', 'subplots', 'characters', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'completely', 'transferred', 'film', 'things', 'are', 'cut', 'Dursleys', 'others', 'are', 'added', 'early', 'scene', 'showing', 'Harry', 'Muggle', 'diner', 'What', 'was', 'cut', 'did', 'not', 'mar', 'story', 'additions', 'were', 'mostly', 'keeping', 'overall', 'tone', 'Dark', 'times', 'have', 'come', 'wizard', 'world', 'Voldemort', 'extending', 'power', 'even', 'Muggles', 'recognize', 'dark', 'forces', 'are', 'work', 'Harry', 'now', 'recognized', 'fellow', 'wizards', 'Chosen', 'One', 'typical', '16', 'year', 'old', 'gone', 'head', 'bit', 'torn', 'need', 'be', 'teenager', 'dealing', 'emotions', 'friends', 'would', 'be', 'lovers', 'inescapable', 'fate', 'nemesis', 'Dark', 'Lord.In', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'learn', 'more', 'early', 'history', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'scenes', 'are', 'best', 'film', 'showing', 'young', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'Muggle', 'orphanage', 'later', 'most', 'gifted', 'troubled', 'student', 'Hogwarts', 'get', 'hints', 'what', 'come', 'final', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'movies', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'read', 'last', 'book', 'will', 'have', 'experience', 'ruined', 'overall', 'tone', 'dark', 'are', 'supremely', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'mainly', 'dealing', 'Harry', 'Ginny', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'personal', 'lives', 'as', 'well', 'very', 'well', 'portrayed', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'returning', 'cast', 'members', 'continue', 'do', 'remarkable', 'job', 'get', 'more', 'insights', 'characters', 'particularly', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Severus', 'Snape.The', 'film', 'greatly', 'enhanced', 'fine', 'soundtrack', 'carryovers', 'earlier', 'films', 'overall', 'theme', 'music', 'including', 'couple', 'favorites', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'Fireworks', 'Dumbledore', 'Army']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122133,A168VXSISJWQN9,B000ZECQ08,"John D. Muir ""oldies and pies lover""","[8, 12]","I think this is one of the better Harry Potter movies. I liked the humor, especially from Ron (Rupert Grint), who has more to do in this movie and makes the most of his opportunities. The special effects are great and the sense of impending doom is well conveyed via a clever use of muted color- much of the movie is almost sepia. Jim Broadbent, as might be expected, makes Horace Slughorn an interesting addition to the cast. Michael Gambon has not always seemed to find the role of Dumbledore coming naturally to him, but this time round he is at his most convincing. Alan Rickman, as ever, is the creepiest and most mysterious figure in the story, Helena Bonham Carter is the epitome of uncontrolled evil and Daniel Radcliffe brings Harry to life in a way that must now be second nature to him. Emma Watson as Hermione is a little sidelined in this film, but Bonnie Wright as Ginny is now very much a young woman and it's easy to tell why Harry is finally seeing her as something other than Ron's little sister.The main issue for many people seems to be lack of fidelity to the book. Like most lovers of the books, there are scenes I would have liked to have seen, notably Dumbledore's visit to Privet Drive at the start of the story, but the movie has to be considered on its own merits. The last 4 books are huge and contain far more material than could ever be included in a movie. The director and screenwriter have to consider how to move the story along in order to get to the conclusion; and they have to produce something that will work on the screen. A book can look into people's heads, but a movie needs something to happen to make it watchable. I think they did a good job in this respect and brought the film nicely to the point at which the final showdown can begin. Everything that was included made sense in the context of the story, even though in many respects it wasn't the way the book did it. As other reviewers have said, forget the book and you'll find the movie works very well.Why only four stars? Simply because the movie is not a complete and self-contained entity. It assumes familiarity with the characters and it leaves the story to be continued. The full set, when it is released in two or three years, will be five stars. This is an instalment in a series- but a very good one.",4,"It's a film, not a book",1256688000,"10 28, 2009",2009,2312,"['think', 'one', 'better', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'liked', 'humor', 'especially', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'who', 'more', 'do', 'movie', 'most', 'opportunities', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'great', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'well', 'conveyed', 'clever', 'use', 'muted', 'color-', 'much', 'movie', 'almost', 'sepia', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'might', 'be', 'expected', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'interesting', 'addition', 'cast', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'not', 'always', 'seemed', 'find', 'role', 'Dumbledore', 'coming', 'naturally', 'time', 'round', 'most', 'convincing', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'ever', 'creepiest', 'most', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'story', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'epitome', 'uncontrolled', 'evil', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'Harry', 'life', 'way', 'must', 'now', 'be', 'second', 'nature', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Hermione', 'little', 'sidelined', 'film', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'Ginny', 'now', 'very', 'much', 'young', 'woman', 'easy', 'tell', 'why', 'Harry', 'finally', 'seeing', 'something', 'other', 'Ron', 'little', 'sister.The', 'main', 'issue', 'many', 'people', 'be', 'lack', 'fidelity', 'book', 'most', 'lovers', 'books', 'are', 'scenes', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'notably', 'Dumbledore', 'visit', 'Privet', 'Drive', 'start', 'story', 'movie', 'be', 'considered', 'own', 'merits', 'last', '4', 'books', 'are', 'huge', 'contain', 'far', 'more', 'material', 'could', 'ever', 'be', 'included', 'movie', 'director', 'screenwriter', 'have', 'consider', 'how', 'move', 'story', 'along', 'order', 'get', 'conclusion', 'have', 'produce', 'something', 'will', 'work', 'screen', 'book', 'can', 'look', 'people', 'heads', 'movie', 'something', 'happen', 'make', 'watchable', 'think', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'respect', 'brought', 'film', 'nicely', 'point', 'final', 'showdown', 'can', 'begin', 'Everything', 'was', 'included', 'made', 'sense', 'context', 'story', 'even', 'many', 'respects', 'was', ""n't"", 'way', 'book', 'did', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'forget', 'book', ""'ll"", 'find', 'movie', 'very', 'well.Why', 'only', 'four', 'stars', 'Simply', 'movie', 'not', 'complete', 'self-contained', 'entity', 'familiarity', 'characters', 'story', 'be', 'continued', 'full', 'set', 'when', 'released', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'will', 'be', 'five', 'stars', 'instalment', 'series-', 'very', 'good', 'one']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1122137,AHR9GFUXXEHY0,B000ZECQ08,Jon Thompson,"[16, 22]","Although I more or less enjoyed this latest installment in the Harry Potter film franchise, it clearly marks the final divergence of the films from their literary source material. From this point onwards the Harry Potter movies will have very little to do with the core of the Harry Potter novels.There are a number of reasons for this, many of which can't really be blamed on anything other than the unusual circumstances under which the film series was created. Consider that the first HP film came out before the fifth of the novels had even been written. As a result some of the smaller details in that first film (and the subsequent three films) which at first glance through the pages of the book don't appear to have very much significance were, correctly (based on what the filmmakers knew at the time) cut or deleted from the films. The problem, now that the entire saga has been completed in the books, is that some of those seemingly meaningless details from the earlier books take on tremendous significance, some being absolutely vital for the correct and complete working out of the main story arc. Of course there is no way the filmmakers could have known this as even J.K. herself hadn't yet sat down and ""discovered"" their importance for the latter part of the tale herself.But the overall effect on the film series is that vast swathes of the story have to either be dropped, clumsily crammed in with hasty and unconvincing supporting exposition that was missed in earlier installments, or totally changed in order to get to a suitable conclusion of the epic in its film version. In other words, the way the books conclude is now virtually impossible to accomplish with the final two films yet to come. (Think trynig to do ""Hamlet"" without Polonius, Ophelia or Laertes. While they might not, in and of themselves, be necessary to the action, without them how does Hamlet maneuver into the position he must occupy in the final show down with the King?)The other disappointment at this point in the film series is that the ""magic"" is pretty much gone. The sense of wonder has now completely faded and magic is simply another ordinary aspect of the universe where a decidedly grim tale is occurring. In other words, watching this film (and I'm sure the final two yet to come) will be something of a trial. They are setting a tone that is unrelentingly grim, dark, depressing and, perhaps worst of all, rushed and shallow. I doubt if anyone who has never read any of the books or seen any of the other films would look at this installment and enjoy it very much.

1122138,A1DJMQJ3NY7TV5,B000ZECQ08,Jordan David,"[0, 1]","Those who know me may be inclined to say that I'm not one who's really in a position to review anything associated with Harry Potter, not the least of which being his sixth installment.I do acknowledge that my indifference for the franchise has flourished in an age dominated by movies that I believe pay more respect to the fantasy realms.You may understand me, then, when I say that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the best films I've reviewed all year, and speaks for itself as a testament to the non-believers like myself that such a late film in the saga has driven me into humble conversion.Those behind the scenes have finally figured out how to bring the people to the center of attention, as opposed to the magic.  And, ironically, you feel that this is the way it was supposed to have been all along.  The magic is still there; it's in the delightfully comfortable actors and actresses, many of which have come to form elegantly and beautifully.And elegance is certainly the name of the game, here.  Everything about this film emits a sophisticated, casual eloquence to it that is much easier to appreciate than the anxiety and disjointed flash atmosphere that seemed to coalesce in the past films when there was an intermission between significant events.  Novice David Yates was patient this time around, and it paid off in spades.Predictably, the Harry Potter universe is getting increasingly more crowded, and it would prove difficult for anyone to keep screen time balanced.  Yates does this with as much precision as one could, all things considered, but it is saddening to see some once-prominent characters now taking solace in the distant background, clearly obstructed by the charming trio, surprisingly solid Draco Malfoy (who just shines, especially considering his very minor roles in the past few installments) and the solemn Dumbledore.The film is exempt of a great deal of action, and explosion enthusiasts may be turned off by such.  The effects play their part, though, complementing the performances instead of suffocating them, and are as striking as ever.Ultimately, The Half Blood Prince has made me genuinely excited for what the end of times may hold for Harry and his friends, to the point where, even now, I cant help but feel a haunting and bittersweet twang of the heart that this epic journey is finally coming to an end.

1122140,AO80ZID761BZH,B000ZECQ08,Joseph_,"[0, 1]","With a unique title slapped across it's glossy face, ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" is the sixth movie in the world of adapting the wildly popular book series into blockbusters. I originally saw it in theaters (in a special, chaotic midnight showing, in fact, which will be the first and last one I attend) and thought I loved it. But when I recently purchased it, upon seeing it released into DVD format, and re-watched it, I fluttered down from my cloud and realized it was, sadly, less than perfect.Being a movie of beautiful cinematography and amazing computer graphics, it is far from being a fail. Do not listen to the parts of the audience who wailed about it being too different from the book- it's called an ""adaption"", not ""an exact replica of the popular book"" for a reason- it is indeed a good movie. And yet I felt it didn't succeed as well as I expected it to, as much as a HP movie should have.The movie has some definite slow and dry parts; parts that I admit I fast-forwarded through, since my memories from the silver screening in July aren't frayed yet. There was a bit too much dialog; it ran a bit too long; some sequences were, admittedly, twisted a bit too drastically from the book. Not exactly in a bad way, but in a weird way.For example, they destroy the Weasley's home in this movie. What?! I was baffled as I saw it collapse before me- well, on the screen before me. And the ending, where instead of Dumbledore freezing Harry motionless, Harry is left capable of stopping Draco and Snape, yet stands below and does quite nothing.But I decided against complaining, because it is still a winning movie. It has some clever, funny parts- parts that are certainly aimed towards it's chunk of the audience that are teens and young adults- and I love how dark it has gotten. It was filmed grainer, too, and I love the feel it shimmers towards the audience. The actors all did well, I thought, and overall, I found myself shutting off the DVD player with a refreshed sense of easiness, yet not completely satisified.So as I wrap up my review, I think I can easily say this- not the best Harry Potter movie out there, but a far cry from the worst. A very good one to buy, but perhaps not golden enough to slip the brittle words ""classic"" and ""beloved"" over it's cover.",3,"The Sixth ""Harry Potter"" Movie",1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,2298,"['unique', 'title', 'slapped', 'glossy', 'face', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'sixth', 'movie', 'world', 'adapting', 'wildly', 'popular', 'book', 'series', 'blockbusters', 'originally', 'saw', 'theaters', 'special', 'chaotic', 'midnight', 'showing', 'fact', 'will', 'be', 'first', 'last', 'one', 'attend', 'thought', 'loved', 'when', 'recently', 'purchased', 'seeing', 'released', 'DVD', 'format', 're-watched', 'fluttered', 'down', 'cloud', 'realized', 'was', 'sadly', 'less', 'perfect.Being', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'amazing', 'computer', 'graphics', 'far', 'being', 'fail', 'Do', 'not', 'listen', 'parts', 'audience', 'who', 'wailed', 'being', 'too', 'different', 'book-', 'called', 'adaption', 'not', 'exact', 'replica', 'popular', 'book', 'reason-', 'indeed', 'good', 'movie', 'yet', 'felt', 'did', ""n't"", 'succeed', 'as', 'well', 'expected', 'as', 'much', 'HP', 'movie', 'should', 'have.The', 'movie', 'definite', 'slow', 'dry', 'parts', 'parts', 'admit', 'fast-forwarded', 'memories', 'silver', 'screening', 'July', 'are', ""n't"", 'frayed', 'yet', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'dialog', 'ran', 'bit', 'too', 'long', 'sequences', 'were', 'admittedly', 'twisted', 'bit', 'too', 'drastically', 'book', 'Not', 'exactly', 'bad', 'way', 'weird', 'way.For', 'example', 'destroy', 'Weasley', 'home', 'movie', 'What', 'was', 'baffled', 'saw', 'collapse', 'me-', 'well', 'screen', 'ending', 'where', 'instead', 'Dumbledore', 'freezing', 'Harry', 'motionless', 'Harry', 'left', 'capable', 'stopping', 'Draco', 'Snape', 'yet', 'quite', 'nothing.But', 'decided', 'complaining', 'still', 'winning', 'movie', 'clever', 'funny', 'parts-', 'parts', 'are', 'certainly', 'aimed', 'chunk', 'audience', 'are', 'teens', 'young', 'adults-', 'love', 'how', 'dark', 'gotten', 'was', 'filmed', 'grainer', 'too', 'love', 'feel', 'audience', 'actors', 'did', 'well', 'thought', 'overall', 'found', 'shutting', 'off', 'DVD', 'player', 'refreshed', 'sense', 'easiness', 'yet', 'not', 'completely', 'satisified.So', 'wrap', 'up', 'review', 'think', 'can', 'easily', 'say', 'this-', 'not', 'best', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'there', 'far', 'cry', 'worst', 'very', 'good', 'one', 'buy', 'perhaps', 'not', 'golden', 'enough', 'slip', 'brittle', 'words', 'classic', 'beloved', 'cover']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122141,A2R1YK3THA0RB3,B000ZECQ08,Josh,"[0, 0]","As I have stated before in some of my earlier reviews, its obvious that you cannot take a book that has more pages and words than bees have hives and make a movie. You can however, take a book and make a movie that stays true to form and does its best to keep up with the pace of the original novel. In that category we have: Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.The acting in this movie was great. I feel that Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and even Tom Felton  (though he is a bit of a cry baby at times in this one) shine in this movie especially.Harry Potter is growing up rapidly as he is now 16 and set to start another year at Hogwarts. Dumbledore meets Harry outside of the wizarding world and then asks a favor of Harry. From there, we meet a new professor, Horace Slughorn. Not long after these series of events while Harry is on his way to Hogwarts with Ron and Hermione, suspicions arise after seeing Draco and Narcissa talking to what appears to be Death Eaters. And that is only the beginning of the mystery.Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince deals with issues such as: love, loyalty, and sacrifice. The tone of the movie overall can be described as engagingly humorous, eagerly romantic, but as serious as the book is; some even argue that this is one of the darker stories in the series, I can be inclined to agree tremendously.

1122142,A32IDF7JFAPXAG,B000ZECQ08,"Joshua Glowzinski ""Gman""","[0, 7]","The movie starts with Harry about to get a date.  Then, out of no where Dumbledore shows up.  (apparition anyone)  He tells Harry that he needs him.  He needs him to visit some one, an old teacher.  Dumbledore wants him to teach but the teacher always says no.  After Harry talking to him by himself (Dumbledore goes to the bathroom) the teacher still says no.  Then though he decides to do it.  So, now Hogwarts has a new teacher.  The teacher knew Voldemort when he attended Hogwarts.  Harry finds this out when Dumbledore takes a vile with a memory of his and dumps it in some water.  Harry puts his face in and sees the memory.  Dumbledore though, says it is a false memory.  He asks Harry to find out more about the teacher.The second part of the story involves a school book that Harry got.  It says Half Blood Prince.  The book has things written inside that help Harry with his spells.  So much so that even Hermione can't keep up.  So, Harry tries to figure out who the Half Blood Prince was.  Turns out that it may be a teacher that is at Hogwarts.  One which Harry may not get along with.  So, this person in with whom Harry can't talk to may be helping him out.Another part of the story, which ads humor, is the romance.  Ron has a girl who likes him very much.  Hermione may have a problem with this girl.  Ron keeps things going with her, always telling Harry about things they do together.  Poor Hermione is there as well.  She gets a little stressed and emotional when she hears him talking.  Something happens to Ron.  He is asleep in the hospital.  Harry and Hermione are standing by his side as well as some others and the girlfriend shows up.  After Hermione and her share some words they hear Ron saying something.  I will not say what it is.  But the girlfriend leaves.  Angry and hurt.  While Hermione remains, with a little added happiness.  Also, Harry starts to see Genie as something he could like.  She already seems to feel this way about harry.  So, what will happen with the two couples of friends?Then, there is something strange.  Something that is given to a student.  By someone Harry and his friends know.  Malfoy!  The item is a necklace.  When the girl it is given to touches it, she almost dies.  They are able to save her, but she can not remember who gave her the necklace.  Harry figures it out.  Dumbledore tells Harry that the item given to the girl is something very dangerous.  Turns out that the item has something to do with the memory that the teacher has.  The one Harry viewed in which Dumbledore told him was a false memory.  Harry has to convince the new teacher to let him see the real memory.  He does so and finds out that the necklace was a horcrux.  An item that lets someone break their should into parts.  Each part is out into an item and hidden.  Turns out Voldemort has do this.  Seven times!  Harry and Dumbledore decide that they have to find them.  For if they do it will help with the defeat of Voldemort.  Harry and Dumbledore find a place that has one of the pieces of soul.  They go to get it.  Before they do, Dumbledore tells Harry that he must listen to everything he says.  If he says run, run.  If he says leave him their, leave him their.  If Dumbledore screams in pain to stop, then Harry must force him to continue.  Well, something big happens.  I don't want to give it away though, so you will have to watch and see.In then end Harry tells Ron and Hermione that he cannot go back to school.  He has to find the Horcrux that Dumbledore and he started looking for.  Hermione tells him that sometimes, though brave, can be thick.  She tells him that they will all three go and look.  Thus the movie ends.  The movie flew by.  It was more serious than any of the Potter movies.  In my opinion that is.  You really feel like you have been there with them through it all.  They do a great job of making the characters feel like they grow with you.

1122143,A2KXQ1CIU9B8Z2,B000ZECQ08,JR,"[26, 35]","As a huge Harry Potter fan who has read the last two books with excitment and breathlessness, I had come to this film prepared to accept that the film is always different from the book and that I should steel myself. And I did, briefy, till I started to see the glaring omissions in this film that were left on the cutting room floor.  Yes, I am well aware that the whole book cannot be filmed, understandable, but the heart of the book is Tom Riddle and the mystery of the Half blood Prince, anyone who is a true Potter fan should take no issue with that.  So riddle me this with the following glaring holes in this film that are central heart of the story--let's a look at them...There are a number of flash back scenes that build Tom Riddle's character. We get two. No mention of his affection for Hogwarts, or why Dumbledore was drawn to him. No mention of how he forms the cruxis of the death eaters while he is a student there, which includes Snape.Our wonderful Wizard's hand- how did it get that way? Harry barely registers any surprise.  Why show his hand if you are not going to explain how he got that way and how crucial it is to the story.  Makes little sense.The Half Blood Prince.  The whole counter point to Tom Riddle is Snape. It is barely given a glancing blow in the film and Alan Rickman's role is wasted as his entire back story is thrown to the cutting room floor. Why spend so much time with this character if you are going to gut his part in the story.Silly Teen Romance. Yes we all enjoy the moments of light humor and teen angst, but why amp it up so high for this one and leave all the good stuff on the trash pile.  There is way to much silliness in this film that takes away from the story and all I wanted to do was go back to the real tale each time they deal with this nonsense. Rowling new that these romances have to play a back shadow to much larger issues in the story, the directors decided after all the criticisms that the film was becoming increasingly dark that they'd lighten it up.  Big mistake.Harry and his connection to Tom Riddle is also given no shrift at all, not even short shrift.

1122145,A10G4BPT5MGBHY,B000ZECQ08,Julie Neal,"[34, 63]","Wide-eyed wonder, a sly sense of humor, a truly disturbing villain... this sixth installment in the Harry Potter series has all this plus a striking visual style. Although Potter newbies will be lost (the movie assumes you know what has gone before and who the characters are), Harry's fans will be thrilled.The story is complex even for followers of the series. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, after scolding Harry about being reckless over the summer for riding London subway trains, leads the young wizard on one dangerous adventure after another. The goal is to stop He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord Voldemort, who is growing in power and murdering people both in and out of the magical world. The secret to stopping the Dark Lord lies with Professor Slughorn, who taught at Hogwarts when Voldemort was simply a student named Tom Riddle. Slughorn has a repressed memory that Harry must observe to understand how to destroy Voldemort. He observes by plunging his face into liquid memories in a glowing bowl called a Pensieve. (Well named, as a ""pensive"" person is quietly reflecting on a memory.)When Dumbledore says ""That was fun!"" after performing a bit of magic, I agreed with him, and gave myself over to the story. In the last couple of Harry Potter movies, the characters' reaction to their magic has been sort of perfunctory and humdrum. In ""Half-Blood Prince"" the wonder -- and the fun -- is back.Most of the humor comes from teenage romances, notably involving Harry's best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Grainger, and Ron's sister Ginny. Ron's misadventures with the smitten Lavender Brown -- and Hermione's reaction -- are funny and true-to-life. Ron complains to Harry that he must dump Lavender because of the non-stop kissing: ""My lips are getting chapped!"" And a conversation between the two boys about noticing who has nice skin -- Harry mentions Ginny's skin; Ron Hermione's -- is sweet, and revealing.The considerable chills in ""Half-Blood Prince"" come courtesy of the evil Voldemort's birth in the young student Tom Riddle. When you first meet the boy in a memory, he is so strange, so creepy and odd, you have compassion for him. What awful thing must have happened to him to make him this way? Voldemort seems scarier here as a quietly evil student than as the freakish monster he turns into.The cinematography is stunning. The coloring and lighting make scenes seem like works of art. Often the color is bleached from the screen, with only one item in color (usually red). Other shots are infused with silvery light, giving landscapes and objects an otherworldly look. Steep, angular camera angles make scenes dramatic and emotional. It's a visual feast.One thing I didn't miss was the buffoonish Dursley family, Harry's adoptive relatives, who are absent in ""Half-Blood Prince."" All three seemed too much like cartoons for my taste. The new characters are much more fun, notably loopy Luna with her oddball fashion sense and boy-crazy Lavender Brown.Give yourself plenty of time for this one: it clocks in at two and a half hours. When it's over, you'll be more than ready for Harry's last chapter.",5,That was fun!,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,3130,"['Wide-eyed', 'wonder', 'sly', 'sense', 'humor', 'truly', 'disturbing', 'villain', 'sixth', 'installment', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'striking', 'visual', 'style', 'Potter', 'newbies', 'will', 'be', 'lost', 'movie', 'know', 'what', 'gone', 'before', 'who', 'characters', 'are', 'Harry', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'thrilled.The', 'story', 'complex', 'even', 'followers', 'series', 'Headmaster', 'Albus', 'Dumbledore', 'scolding', 'Harry', 'being', 'reckless', 'summer', 'riding', 'London', 'subway', 'trains', 'young', 'wizard', 'one', 'dangerous', 'adventure', 'goal', 'stop', 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'who', 'growing', 'power', 'murdering', 'people', 'magical', 'world', 'secret', 'stopping', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Professor', 'Slughorn', 'who', 'taught', 'Hogwarts', 'when', 'Voldemort', 'was', 'simply', 'student', 'named', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'Slughorn', 'repressed', 'memory', 'Harry', 'must', 'observe', 'understand', 'how', 'destroy', 'Voldemort', 'plunging', 'face', 'liquid', 'memories', 'glowing', 'bowl', 'called', 'Pensieve', 'Well', 'named', 'pensive', 'person', 'quietly', 'reflecting', 'memory', 'When', 'Dumbledore', 'was', 'fun', 'performing', 'bit', 'magic', 'agreed', 'gave', 'story', 'last', 'couple', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'characters', 'reaction', 'magic', 'been', 'sort', 'perfunctory', 'humdrum', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'wonder', 'fun', 'back.Most', 'humor', 'teenage', 'romances', 'notably', 'involving', 'Harry', 'best', 'friends', 'Ron', 'Weasley', 'Hermione', 'Grainger', 'Ron', 'sister', 'Ginny', 'Ron', 'misadventures', 'smitten', 'Lavender', 'Brown', 'Hermione', 'reaction', 'are', 'funny', 'true-to-life', 'Ron', 'Harry', 'must', 'dump', 'Lavender', 'non-stop', 'kissing', 'lips', 'are', 'getting', 'chapped', 'conversation', 'two', 'boys', 'noticing', 'who', 'nice', 'skin', 'Harry', 'mentions', 'Ginny', 'skin', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'sweet', 'considerable', 'chills', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'come', 'courtesy', 'evil', 'Voldemort', 'birth', 'young', 'student', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'When', 'first', 'meet', 'boy', 'memory', 'so', 'strange', 'so', 'creepy', 'odd', 'have', 'compassion', 'What', 'awful', 'thing', 'must', 'have', 'happened', 'make', 'way', 'Voldemort', 'scarier', 'here', 'quietly', 'evil', 'student', 'freakish', 'monster', 'into.The', 'cinematography', 'stunning', 'coloring', 'lighting', 'make', 'scenes', 'seem', 'works', 'art', 'color', 'bleached', 'screen', 'only', 'one', 'item', 'color', 'usually', 'red', 'Other', 'shots', 'are', 'infused', 'silvery', 'light', 'giving', 'landscapes', 'otherworldly', 'look', 'Steep', 'angular', 'camera', 'angles', 'make', 'scenes', 'dramatic', 'emotional', 'visual', 'feast.One', 'thing', 'did', ""n't"", 'miss', 'was', 'buffoonish', 'Dursley', 'family', 'Harry', 'adoptive', 'relatives', 'who', 'are', 'absent', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'three', 'seemed', 'too', 'much', 'cartoons', 'taste', 'new', 'characters', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'fun', 'notably', 'Luna', 'oddball', 'fashion', 'sense', 'boy-crazy', 'Lavender', 'Brown.Give', 'plenty', 'time', 'one', 'two', 'half', 'hours', 'When', 'over', ""'ll"", 'be', 'more', 'ready', 'Harry', 'last', 'chapter']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1122150,A28OB1QLXN5BM6,B000ZECQ08,"Karen Joan ""Siren""","[6, 17]","As a diehard Harry Potter fan, I really enjoyed HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Yes, there are cuts and edits.  This movie has the same problem that all book-to-film conversions have:  you cannot put all of the detail into the film that a writer puts into a book.  As it is, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE is nearly 3 hours long.  IMHO, the writers, director, and editors did the best jobs that they could, and this time they succeeded in giving us most of important plot points without making HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE into a multi-night miniseries.Almost everyone knows or is at least familiar with the 7-book saga of Harry Potter written by J. K. Rowling, so I will not go into a detailed description here.  Suffice it to say, that with the exception of some minor edits and changes, the film is pretty true to the basic plotlines of the book.  Harry is the Chosen One; he must defeat Voldemort.  In HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, Harry learns more about the history of Tom Riddle, why he became what he is, and what he must do to defeat him.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson continue to shine as they bring Harry, Ron, and Hermione to life.  It has been fun watching these kids and their characters change and grow.  This trio has done an unparalleled job in bringing these internationally beloved characters to life...their casting 9 years ago was farsighted and inspired.  They ARE Harry, Ron, and Hermione - exactly as I always imagined them to be.  Of course everyone in the Harry Potter films has become the personification of their characters.  From Dumbledore to Snape, McGonagall to Mrs. Weasley, Hagrid to Filch, Luna to Neville, and Draco to Riddle, these outstanding performers have created a very special and unique world, near and dear to all of our hearts.One of the best parts of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was that the fun and humor are back.  This HARRY POTTER film is not as dark or bleak as the more recent films have been.  The writers and actors do a fantastic job of portraying the angst, goofiness, and raging hormones of teenaged love.  I laughed a lot watching this film, something that was sorely missed in the last film.  To quote Dumbledore, ""That was fun!""  And it was!Of course, changes and cuts had to be made to the story to keep HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE from turning into a marathon.  While some will moan and groan over these edits, it is important to remember that all the little details, the vivid description, and needed exposition that make this world so real to us just simply cannot make the transition to the big screen.  Instead, we get color, depth, music, voices, facial expressions, body language, scenery, animals, people, and special effects to bring this world to life.  In the case of HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, it seems to be a very successful trade off.  All the important plot points are made, and the final two films are well set up.  I am also going to hazard a guess that a few of the missing story lines from HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE will be moved into the next film, and that makes good sense to me.Overall, HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was fun, funny, and familiar.  The magic is back, and it certainly worked wonders on me.

1122159,A27P0MW8TE1JQP,B000ZECQ08,Kevin J. Loria,"[3, 9]","Warner Bros. delayed film version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ...it was worth the wait. J.K.Rowling's young wizard enters into his last full year of attending Hogwarts...I initially described the Half-Blood Prince novel as having a distinct post-911 feel to it...as does it's film counterpart...the Dark Lord is back to full strength (as seen in his battle with Dumbledore at the climax of ""Order of the Phoenix""), the wizarding world is now privy to the knowledge of this return and it is a very different place, than it was when we first met Harry back in the Sorcerer's Stone. There is an gloomy atmosphere of fear and foreboding evident even in the brief moments we see of the Muggle's perspective, in an early scene in which Harry reads of disasters impacting both worlds. Even the familiar Diagon Alley is ...well unfamiliar, shopkeepers packed and gone or worst , as we see wandmaker Ollivander abducted following the destruction of his shop ....the only wand casting ""lumos"" on this darkened new world the Weasley twins Joke shop, alas, all too brief. New concepts, like apparitions, Felix Felicis and Horcruxes are introduced and old ones like the memory exposition vehicle of the pensive return to great effect. Also returning is the Director of ""Order of the Phoenix"" David Yates who does a fine job giving the material a real world connection opening with attacks in London. Yates focuses on more matters of heart than any Potter film to date, not just the love potions and love interests. But, Harry and Dumbledore's connection, the bonds of family via the Weasleys, Draco's angst-filled moments all come alive. Yates' vision of Quidditch is the finest yet seen, here the wizard sport really feels like, well, a sport...bone crunching blocks and offensive plays! Great comedic moments, with Ron especially, truly scary moments with Voldemort's undead guardians and the curse-attack Katie Bell, made my hair stand on end (and her's). This is the most adult outing yet for the francise, not just the boy/girl issues of adolescent, but the cast has never been more comfortable in their roles...Ginny sure has come along way...and go re-watch the young neophyte Harry in Sorcerer's Stone if you doubt that.Like many of the Potter stories/film this one contains it's share of exposition and flashback, but like it's predecessors , unique methods of delivering these ""flashbacks"" are used...this time we get the origin of the Dark Lord Voldemort via Dumbledore's visit to an orphanage to meet his future Nemesis. In addition to this, other answers are given as to how Tom Riddle became the seemingly immortal ""He who must not be named"" and what Harry must do to face him....the beginning of Harry's quest to defeat Voldemort. In addition to this, attacks on students begin and Hogwarts is (again) unsafe, but who is the real target...who is this assassin?. Meanwhile, love is in the air and candies, as Harry only belatedly realizes his would be truelove,...and Ron is still a mess, only this time with imbibed love potion.Fortunately for the filmmakers ...the cast of the series has aged well and each has grown up to be attractive or at least interesting-looking (Daniel Radcliffe, Bonnie Wright, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint),recasting would have be unfortunate, so we don't really need to suspend disbelief to the level of say Frankie and Annette in a Beach flick, everyone young enough for the big screen vision of the books. Among the returning cast is Tom Felton a Harry's school nemesis Draco Malfoy, given so much more to work with in this one Felton is growing worthy of the adult veterans he shares scenes with (namely Alan Rickman terrifically cast as Prof. Snape)... Dumbledore is again Michael Gambon, who replace the late great Richard Harris, Gambon is much better in this feature than in previous films, but I feel the emotional content greatly diminished by his presence instead of his predecessor, Evanna Lynch again makes with the scene stealing as Luna Lovegood (who replaces the Tonks character for early scenes, to greater effect than the original text), Bellatrix Lestrange  played so wonderfully wicked by Helena Bonham Carter that a completely original  sequence is added at the Burrow.. as some old roles are expanded others are reduced, like scenes with Draco's sidekicks Crabbe & Goyle as little girls, most unfortunately Neville Longbottom has maybe one line...considering his importance to the final moments of the final installment I fear even this will be cut....absent entirely are Harry's horrible non-wizard kin the Dursleys (shame to as the scene with Dumbledore berating their abuse would have been great to see come to screen). New to the series Jim Broadbent's DELIGHTFUL Professor Slughorn this installment's obligatory new teacher to Hogwarts, also new and satisfyingly chilling to watch is Hero Fienn Tiffin as an 11-year-old Tom Riddle in a flashbacks, who is the real nephew of Ralph Fiennes, who plays the adult Voldemort, who is absent from ""Half-blood Prince"" physically, but he's presence surely has weight that is felt in nearly every scene as Dumbledore preps Harry for his final battle with the Dark Lord. Lines about Harry's blood being more precious than his own, really take this notion home.Overall: ""HALF-BLOOD"" is a way, WAAY abridged and jazzed up Hollywood version of the book for the screen....in many ways better than any of the series to date. The perfect balance of comedy, horror and action that makes the HP films successful...so to the cast and crew I say ""Mischief managed!""If you have read the book and want to know what was cut and what wasn't......OTHERWISE DON'T READ ON ....SPOILERS BELOW...The Other Minister and recap of over 5 years of book exposition and  intro to the new Minister of Magic Scrimgeour replaces Fudge...yep it was cut.Snape Takes the Unbreakable oath to protect Draco on his mission for the Dark Lord...the unedited version is another 5 year (plus) explanation of why he didn't kill Harry and why he is still Voldemort's most faithful servant....this is edited, but kept.Harry & the Dursley's ....Dumbledore's visit to Privot Drive...exposition on Harry as heir to his Godfather's estate/ the Order's HQ and house elf  Kreacher (who's important to the 7th Book)....also cut, replaced with ""Harry at a Diner flirting with a waitress""...strange.Harry and Dumbledore's stop over recruitment of Slughorn, is interesting for revealing the atmosphere in the wizarding world as they find the would be Professor hiding out, fearing for his life. I figured this would be cut....but they kept it...rounding out Slughorn nicely.Things go a lot faster after reaching the Burrow...Wedding subplot? No. Lots less Tonks and no Fleur, thankfully...added at the Burrow is a Xmas action sequence...instead of Harry's confrontation with the new Minister, makes sense, but sort of eliminates the need for the Wedding attack in HP7, or a wedding at all without Bill or Fleur.Trip to Diagon Alley still includes Joke Shop (didn't seeU-NO-POO?), like a mentioned before, and Malfoy is tailed without any confrontation as clues to his destiny are given in Knockturn Alley..Trouble on the Hogwarts express is kept, while the Slughorn ""meet and greet"" is altered.Tonks is cut and swapped out for Luna, which I like better, the Tonks / Lupin stuff in the book seems too contrived, even more so than Harry.Harry gets his used Textbook, care of the Half-Blood Prince load with tips, ...becomes a potion expert, but the Prince's Levicorpus spell does not appear the film (odd cause it is in the tie-in game), Sectumsempra is as we see when Harry fights Draco again, hides the book, with help from Ginny as a vehicle for their moment alone...Harry and Dumbledore's private lessons and flashbacks happen minus the story of Voldemort's mother? Both versions of Slughorn's memory, too.Aragog's funeral is included, while Harry is on ""Luck"" but the closing Funeral of the story isn't included...we do see poor ole Fawkes, fly off into the setting sun.",4,"...ah yes KISSIN' FIGHTIN' and BRODING, ah...to be young again...and a wizard.",1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,8027,"['Warner', 'Bros.', 'delayed', 'film', 'version', 'Harry',

1122160,A30TK6U7DNS82R,B000ZECQ08,Kevin Killian,"[3, 13]","You get your money's worth with the new Harry Potter.  We went to the 7:15 show and didn't get out till 10:05.  Well, we sat through 11 previews for films the theater owners must think will appeal to the Harry Potter crowd, but all of them look pretty crummy.  How bad does Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs look!  And what about that movie where the kid goes into the elevator of the Empire State Building at night and the whole elevator cab trembles with white light all the way up?  It looks like Harry Potter USA!  So naturally when the real thing came on it looked even better than it is, and that's saying a lot.In short it was great.  I have a few nit picks because, well, I didn't reed the books and couldn't figure out half the stuff that was going on.  Luckily we went with a friend and could text back and forth saying, ""Mark, who is that woman with the crazy black hair?"" (Helena Bonham Carter) and ""How about the woman with the white hair?"" (Narcissa, her sister.)  That didn't take us much further.  I have seen the previous 5 movies but I sort of forgot, and when David Thewlis made his appearance at the Burrow I had completely lost trach of who Remus was.  Why didn't they leave him out, he certainly didn't add much to this one, and as for his wife, the poor actress who played her must have eagerly grabbed the script then screamed in despair when she found out she was only going to say one thing and wear one ugly outfit!  As for the family that adopted Harry, they probably were screaming even louder when they realized they had been cut out of the entire movie!I liked Daniel Radcliffe, who has really grown as an actor, Rupert Grint not so much, but he was OK, but if possible Emma Watson has regressed!  Gone backwards!  Scene after scene left her defenseless, unable to organize even the semblance of a performance.  She's not even as pretty as she used to be.  Oh well, she's still great, but Luna and Lavender trample all over her acting wise.  The adults are just going through their paces.  A few times it looked like Dumbledore was catching forty winks, while talking.  Best performance, the zombie skeleton creatures who swim up out of a lagoon and snatch humans.

As such I was not impressed.  I will admit that the visual darkness is appropriate to the darkness of the plot, but this seemed to extend into the very acting; EVERYTHING was overlaid by a blanket of darkness and slowness.  It seemed to me that the actors were all told to deliver their lines like apathetic depressed people.  There were so many pauses in the middle of sentences, lines that seemed not to convey their characters appropriately.  Hogwarts ceased to feel like Hogwarts with the removal of all color and light.

Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) asks Harry to do a mysterious job for him, while Voldemort has apparently given Draco Malfoy a rather unsavory task.  Amid all this gloom and doom, young love has struck at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all under its spell.I thought the book was bloated and pointless, so I wasn't surprised that the movie was just as tedious, with way too many characters appearing for just seconds doing incomprehensible things.  The much-touted teen romances seemed perfunctory and awkward (but the young people in the theatre audience seemed to enjoy it a lot).  Even though I read the book, I had no idea what was going on with Harry and Draco's assignments (which seemed to drag on and go nowhere); those who haven't read the book will no doubt be completely lost.The film is way too choppy; most scenes are only seconds long with just  one or two lines of dialogue, then it's off to a completely unrelated scene.  Many much-loved characters (Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Neville, Hagrid, and a frail-looking Professor McGonagal) are reduced to mere walk-on parts and even the title character, sadly, gets too little screen time.  On the plus side, the star of the show, Michael Gambon finally seems likeable and Bonnie Wright (Ginny) is slightly less wooden than in the past.But if you liked the book, you'll love the movie.",3,Just like the book,1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,1507,"['Harry', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'sixth', 'year', 'Hogwarts', 'forces', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'are', 'wreaking', 'havoc', 'wizard', 'Muggle', 'Londoners', 'alike', 'Headmaster', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Harry', 'do', 'mysterious', 'job', 'Voldemort', 'apparently', 'given', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'rather', 'unsavory', 'task', 'gloom', 'doom', 'young', 'love', 'struck', 'Hogwarts', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'are', 'spell.I', 'thought', 'book', 'was', 'bloated', 'pointless', 'was', ""n't"", 'surprised', 'movie', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'tedious', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'characters', 'appearing', 'just', 'seconds', 'doing', 'incomprehensible', 'things', 'much-touted', 'teen', 'romances', 'seemed', 'perfunctory', 'awkward', 'young', 'people', 'theatre', 'audience', 'seemed', 'enjoy', 'lot', 'Even', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'Harry', 'Draco', 'assignments', 'seemed', 'drag', 'go', 'nowhere', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'completely', 'lost.The', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'choppy', 'most', 'scenes', 'are', 'only', 'seconds', 'long', 'just', 'one', 'two', 'lines', 'dialogue', 'then', 'completely', 'unrelated', 'scene', 'Many', 'much-loved', 'characters', 'Mr.', 'Mrs.', 'Weasley', 'Neville', 'Hagrid', 'frail-looking', 'Professor', 'McGonagal', 'are', 'reduced', 'mere', 'walk-on', 'parts', 'even', 'title', 'character', 'sadly', 'too', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'plus', 'side', 'star', 'show', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'finally', 'likeable', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'Ginny', 'slightly', 'less', 'wooden', 'past.But', 'liked', 'book', ""'ll"", 'love', 'movie']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

This is how the story goes: Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealousy but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry), Rupert Grint (as Ron) & Emma Watson (as Hermione) is excellent!

1122169,A2AVOVUTRTABTX,B000ZECQ08,"K. Schrecker ""KJS""","[2, 3]","I've reserved my review of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince until now for several reasons.  I learned my lesson after first hating the Prisoner of Azkaban and then realizing it was the best of the Potter movie series after seeing it the second time. After three viewings of HFP, I still have some major issues with the altering of the plot but have discovered that it isn't as bad as I first thought when coming out of the movie theater.Like most Potter fans who have read all the books, I sorely miss the subplots involving Fleur, Bill and Charlie, Tonks and Lupin.  I hate that Tonks wasn't the one to rescue Harry from the train.  I balked at the horrible destruction of the burrows.  I really wanted to see more Alan Rickman--you can never get enough of Alan Rickman.  I wished for more of Maggie Smith, but after realizing her battle with cancer during the filming, I give her props for her courage in going ahead.  Ms. Smith is a giant among actresses with a wonderful list of great films to her credit, but she will always be the one and only Professor McGonagall in my mind and no replacement would be possible.My greatest beef was the anticlimactic ending--in the book, the fight going on with the death eaters and the Army of Dumbledore, along with death of Dumbledore was much more exciting and emotionally moving.  I sorely missed the grandeur of Dumbledore's funeral--which truly illustrated Dumbledore's greatness and how much he was loved by all creatures.  This was the biggest problem of all, along with the poor musical score (a sad rehashing of the last movie bits along with some forgettable fillers).  Please, oh please, pay John Williams anything he wants--beg him if you have to--to write the score for final two movies!However, after my third time viewing the movie, I have to admit that the acting was better than ever, the dialogue was great, the chemistry between the actors has matured and solidified delightfully, the actor for Professor Slughorn was superior even to the character in the book, and Michael Gambon has finally filled the great shoes of Richard Harris.  The actors were the best part of the movie--perfect casting!I give this movie three out of four stars after giving it a real chance and trying to overcome my personal objections to the huge changes from the book (which was simply amazing).  I'm sure in time many Potter fans who were disappointed with this chapter in the series will forgive these mistakes and accept it as it is--a valuable part of the Harry Potter series.",4,Better after a second viewing.,1260662400,"12 13, 2009",2009,2528,"[""'ve"", 'reserved', 'review', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'now', 'several', 'reasons', 'learned', 'lesson', 'first', 'hating', 'Prisoner', 'Azkaban', 'then', 'realizing', 'was', 'best', 'Potter', 'movie', 'series', 'seeing', 'second', 'time', 'three', 'viewings', 'HFP', 'still', 'have', 'major', 'issues', 'altering', 'plot', 'have', 'discovered', ""n't"", 'as', 'bad', 'first', 'thought', 'when', 'coming', 'out', 'movie', 'most', 'Potter', 'fans', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'books', 'sorely', 'miss', 'subplots', 'involving', 'Fleur', 'Bill', 'Charlie', 'Tonks', 'Lupin', 'hate', 'Tonks', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'rescue', 'Harry', 'train', 'balked', 'horrible', 'destruction', 'burrows', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'more', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'can', 'never', 'get', 'enough', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'wished', 'more', 'Maggie', 'Smith', 'realizing', 'battle', 'cancer', 'filming', 'give', 'props', 'courage', 'going', 'ahead', 'Ms.', 'Smith', 'giant', 'actresses', 'wonderful', 'list', 'great', 'films', 'credit', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'one', 'only', 'Professor', 'McGonagall', 'mind', 'replacement', 'would', 'be', 'possible.My', 'greatest', 'beef', 'was', 'anticlimactic', 'ending', 'book', 'fight', 'going', 'death', 'eaters', 'Army', 'Dumbledore', 'death', 'Dumbledore', 'was', 'much', 'more', 'exciting', 'emotionally', 'moving', 'sorely', 'missed', 'grandeur', 'Dumbledore', 'funeral', 'truly', 'illustrated', 'Dumbledore', 'greatness', 'how', 'much', 'was', 'loved', 'creatures', 'was', 'biggest', 'problem', 'poor', 'musical', 'score', 'sad', 'rehashing', 'last', 'movie', 'bits', 'forgettable', 'fillers', 'Please', 'oh', 'please', 'pay', 'John', 'Williams', 'anything', 'beg', 'have', 'write', 'score', 'final', 'two', 'movies', 'However', 'third', 'time', 'viewing', 'movie', 'have', 'admit', 'acting', 'was', 'better', 'ever', 'dialogue', 'was', 'great', 'chemistry', 'actors', 'matured', 'solidified', 'delightfully', 'actor', 'Professor', 'Slughorn', 'was', 'superior', 'even', 'character', 'book', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'finally', 'filled', 'great', 'shoes', 'Richard', 'Harris', 'actors', 'were', 'best', 'part', 'movie', 'perfect', 'casting', 'give', 'movie', 'three', 'four', 'stars', 'giving', 'real', 'chance', 'trying', 'overcome', 'personal', 'objections', 'huge', 'changes', 'book', 'was', 'simply', 'amazing', ""'m"", 'sure', 'time', 'many', 'Potter', 'fans', 'who', 'were', 'disappointed', 'chapter', 'series', 'will', 'forgive', 'mistakes', 'accept', 'valuable', 'part', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Erickson ""Mommy Mystic""","[1, 1]","First off, this is a review of the movie, NOT the contents of this edition, partly because Amazon attaches the same review to all versions of the same movie that it offers (so this review will also show on the Instant option, etc. - not just the DVD), and partly because other reviewers have already stated the contents of this DVD set in any case.Like the prior HP movies, this one does have to cut quite a bit from the book, but I think they did an EXCELLENT job of selecting the plot items that most directly relate to the overall direction of the series. And in the series, Book 6 is when it all becomes clear just what a stunning series this is, IMHO. Things turn distinctly dark in book/movie 5, with an internal battle going on between those that believe Voldemort has returned and those that don't, but now in book/movie 6 it is all out war, and this movie reflects the dark, conflicted feelings this triggers in everyone. Coupled with the increasing complexities of adolescent life - romances and break-ups etc. - this movie is much more grown-up.I think the main things that need to be conveyed in this film are - Harry's conflicted feelings about being the 'chosen one', Dumbledore's ongoing quest to get to the bottom of what Voldemort is trying to do, and his acceptance that he must include Harry in this, the complexity of Snape's role, and the shifting of feelings amongst Hermione, Ron, Jenny and Harry. These are what drive the series, and they are all conveyed brilliantly, in a movie that never fails to entertain, even with its much darker visuals and tone. So although there's a fair amount of the book left out, what is essential is there, and that is what good book adaptation are all about.",5,The Turning Point,1327881600,"01 30, 2012",2012,1715,"['First', 'off', 'review', 'movie', 'NOT', 'contents', 'edition', 'partly', 'Amazon', 'same', 'review', 'versions', 'same', 'movie', 'review', 'will', 'also', 'show', 'Instant', 'option', 'etc', 'not', 'just', 'DVD', 'partly', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'stated', 'contents', 'DVD', 'set', 'case.Like', 'prior', 'HP', 'movies', 'one', 'have', 'cut', 'quite', 'bit', 'book', 'think', 'did', 'EXCELLENT', 'job', 'selecting', 'plot', 'items', 'most', 'directly', 'relate', 'overall', 'direction', 'series', 'series', 'Book', '6', 'when', 'clear', 'just', 'what', 'stunning', 'series', 'IMHO', 'Things', 'turn', 'distinctly', 'dark', 'book/movie', '5', 'internal', 'battle', 'going', 'believe', 'Voldemort', 'returned', 'do', ""n't"", 'now', 'book/movie', '6', 'war', 'movie', 'dark', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'triggers', 'everyone', 'Coupled', 'increasing', 'complexities', 'adolescent', 'life', 'romances', 'break-ups', 'etc', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'grown-up.I', 'think', 'main', 'things', 'need', 'be', 'conveyed', 'film', 'are', 'Harry', 'conflicted', 'feelings', 'being', ""'chosen"", 'one', 'Dumbledore', 'ongoing', 'quest', 'get', 'bottom', 'what', 'Voldemort', 'trying', 'do', 'acceptance', 'must', 'include', 'Harry', 'complexity', 'Snape', 'role', 'shifting', 'feelings', 'Hermione', 'Ron', 'Jenny', 'Harry', 'are', 'drive', 'series', 'are', 'conveyed', 'brilliantly', 'movie', 'never', 'entertain', 'even', 'much', 'darker', 'visuals', 'tone', 'fair', 'amount', 'book', 'left', 'out', 'what', 'essential', 'there', 'what', 'good', 'book', 'adaptation', 'are']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Maybe it is because Half Blood Prince is the first Potter book I read and the book is bound to be better than the movies, but I dont think that is the case here. Voldemort's childhood and how Dumbledore uses the pensive to travel back in time to see his parents and then meet the young boy at the orphanage himself was just amazingly fleshed out and detailed, capitvating and descriptive in the book. Reading through how Voldemort came to be was fascinating and it allowed the audience to grasp the troubled past he endured, the darkness he exhumed and the demons that haunted him so early on eventually rendering him the person he became. There is suddenly an entire human side to Voldemort never seen before and that was powerful. But the movie missed through all these details and just rushed through it. The lake scene was pretty cool - but again in the book it was just so much more eerie than in the movie. I dont think anyone who hasnt read the book will truly understand the artistic mastery that went into creating this work of art; and it really is a work of art: Rowlings outdid herself on this one. I was captivated until the last word and i dont like fiction books.They should have made this movie into two parts, just like with The Deathly Hollows.

Rowling is pure magic, no pun intended.  Still, as a fan of the books, I watch each film, excited each time around to see the story of Harry Potter unfold on the big screen.  I'm not sure what I'm expecting from these films.  I mean, they are adaptions of a book.  In my opinion, books are always better than their movie counterparts.  The Lord of the Rings trilogy might be the only exception in my mind, but that's another story.What has frustrated me about the movies are the missed opportunities, and I'm not even talking about scenes from the books that didn't make the films.  Here's an example:In Order of the Phoenix, the climactic battle at the end of the film between the Death Eaters and The Order culminates in the timely arrival of Dumbledore.  In the book, this is nothing short of a ""Gandalf On A White Horse"" moment.  He arrives as the battle seems lost, and kicks some serious tail. In the film, he walks out of a fireplace like he just woke up from a nap.In this latest film, The Half-blood Prince, we see more of the same.  Once again, a battle sequence at the end of the book finds all hell breaking loose at Hogwarts, after Dumbledore... well... You know.  Instead the Death Eaters just casually walk out of the school, as if it were a passing period.  What makes this an even greater insult is that the filmmakers decide to add a scene that wasn't in the book, and frankly, serves NO PURPOSE.  The ""Attack On The Burrow"", as it has come to be known, makes no sense.  It accomplishes nothing.  It doesn't advance the plot.The filmmakers have one more chance to get it right with the Deathly Hallows.I really hope they do.",1,Missed opportunities once more...,1260748800,"12 14, 2009",2009,1782,"['What', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movies', 'make', 'so', 'unmemorable', 'Obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'source', 'material', 'beloved', 'series', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'pure', 'magic', 'pun', 'intended', 'Still', 'fan', 'books', 'watch', 'film', 'excited', 'time', 'see', 'story', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'unfold', 'big', 'screen', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'what', ""'m"", 'expecting', 'films', 'mean', 'are', 'adaptions', 'book', 'opinion', 'books', 'are', 'always', 'better', 'movie', 'counterparts', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'trilogy', 'might', 'be', 'only', 'exception', 'mind', 'story.What', 'frustrated', 'movies', 'are', 'missed', 'opportunities', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'talking', 'scenes', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'films', 'Here', 'example', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'climactic', 'battle', 'end', 'film', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'Order', 'culminates', 'timely', 'arrival', 'Dumbledore', 'book', 'nothing', 'short', 'Gandalf', 'A', 'White', 'Horse', 'moment', 'battle', 'lost', 'serious', 'tail', 'film', 'fireplace', 'just', 'woke', 'up', 'nap.In', 'latest', 'film', 'Half-blood', 'Prince', 'see', 'more', 'same', 'Once', 'again', 'battle', 'sequence', 'end', 'book', 'hell', 'breaking', 'loose', 'Hogwarts', 'Dumbledore', 'well', 'know', 'Instead', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'just', 'casually', 'walk', 'school', 'were', 'passing', 'period', 'What', 'even', 'greater', 'insult', 'filmmakers', 'decide', 'add', 'scene', 'was', ""n't"", 'book', 'frankly', 'NO', 'PURPOSE', 'Attack', 'Burrow', 'come', 'be', 'known', 'sense', 'nothing', ""n't"", 'advance', 'plot.The', 'filmmakers', 'have', 'one', 'more', 'chance', 'get', 'right', 'Deathly', 'Hallows.I', 'really', 'hope', 'do']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

I tire of individuals claiming a movie is not as well as a book-in this case, the movie would be roughly 10 hours long (although I would probably be one who would happily sit through a 10-hour Harry Potter flick).  My only dislikes are simply a matter of what I envisioned when I read the book-the young Voldemort seen in the pensieve did not meet my mental pic (I had him looking like John F Kennedy Jr. or at least John Mayer) and I felt Snape should have been more involved in the movie instead of merely being on the outskirts until the very end.  I love Alan Rickman's Snape and can't get enough of him.  Other than that, the movie is suitably photographed in dark and ominous tones and the acting is wonderful (I love Ron's girlfriend Lavendar Brown).",4,Well worth the price of admission,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",2012,1135,"['avid', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fan', 'movies', 'books', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'decidedly', 'darker', 'predecessors', 'let', 'face', '-a', 'lot', 'dark', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'Voldemort', 'having', 'wizarding', 'community', 'stranglehold', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'trying', 'desperately', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'tick', 'amazing', 'piece', 'cinematography', 'tire', 'individuals', 'claiming', 'movie', 'not', 'as', 'well', 'book-in', 'case', 'movie', 'would', 'be', 'roughly', '10', 'hours', 'long', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'one', 'who', 'would', 'happily', 'sit', '10-hour', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'flick', 'only', 'dislikes', 'are', 'simply', 'matter', 'what', 'envisioned', 'when', 'read', 'book-the', 'young', 'Voldemort', 'seen', 'pensieve', 'did', 'not', 'meet', 'mental', 'pic', 'had', 'looking', 'John', 'F', 'Kennedy', 'Jr.', 'least', 'John', 'Mayer', 'felt', 'Snape', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'involved', 'movie', 'instead', 'merely', 'being', 'outskirts', 'very', 'end', 'love', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Snape', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'enough', 'Other', 'movie', 'suitably', 'photographed', 'dark', 'ominous', 'tones', 'acting', 'wonderful', 'love', 'Ron', 'girlfriend', 'Lavendar', 'Brown']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122194,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B000ZECQ08,Marc Cabir Davis,"[14, 24]","This is exactly the kind of movie that concisely conveys what sort of generation we are raising - overweight, insipid, listless, boring, directionless, and dull. All those expletives still do not do full justice to the abject uselessness that is this film - one that meanders through scene after scene of some of the worst dialog you've ever heard - and the 'performances' are merely afterthoughts. Consider this a lab experiment gone wrong and all the mice are dead. Yet as a viewer, I bravely soldiered on, half-expecting the movie to raise its' bar and 'take off', so to speak. Unfortunately, this never quite happened.Prime fault lies with the director and the uninspired performances by all the leads - but really, there is only so much they could do with such an over-the-top storyline that gives fantasy fiction a bad name. This wasn't the weakest story in the cannon - in fact, Lord Voldemorts' origins were explained here (in possibly the most interesting segments), and it also does contain Dumbledore's death - which came and went in the space of one minute (even less, I think). Considering the film kills off a major character, it seemed unusual that this was almost clinically filmed, with no interest in actual emotion or depth. A huge failure, all things considered.The need to portray the children here as 'grown up' was most vile, with hideous love triangles that would test the patience of even an infatuated adolescent. For the rest of us, it was more proof that the series has far outstayed its' welcome, considering that past parts, such as 'Azakaban', were so dark, gothic and beautifully directed. This one is soulless and tepid - and by the time the endless Quidditch matches come your way, its clearly a case of one too many. Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks throughout the entire proceedings in a performance that can only be called 'mind-numbing'. The same can be said of poor Maggie Smith who looked utterly bored with everything.Gigantic plotholes seem to permeate the Harry Potter landscape. For example, everytime Hogwarts is under threat by 'dark forces', the combat strategy is to send everyone to bed. ""Off to your rooms, children!"" certainly can't work here, could it? But still, this is what they do. Also, Dumbledore can apparently travel at will to any part of the world in a split second, but at the end of the movie, he is trapped in a cave with Harry, and they use a good half hour of the films time to move from one end of the cave to the other using a boat that they manually pull out of the water. Ridiculous.That said, it bears reminding that this is a childrens' film, and thus, expectations can never be too high. For what its worth, the first three or four Potter films were enjoyable and had its' moment in the sun. The deja vu you feel while watching this is inescapable, and this is the first Potter movie adaptation where nothing will make sense if you haven't read the book first. The final scenes which consist of Ron, Hermione and Harry gazing at the sky is meant to be 'breathtaking' but it only angers you as they come up with the most repugnant script to accompany this segment - everything is a mismatch, things aren't explained properly, and all of a sudden, the movie ends.Two Generous Stars.

1122196,A2I6MHMAZZDCRX,B000ZECQ08,Mark Baker,"[2, 5]","This entry in the series literally picks up at the end of the last.  The wizarding world has finally admitted what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) have been saying for a year - Lord Voldemort is back.  And that leads everyone into a panic.  Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) are barely allowed to go back to Hogwarts by their worried parents, for example.But back they and everyone else go.  Harry is captain of the Quidditch team this year.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) has started teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, making way for Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to regain his long ago post of Potions.  And love is in the air as all our main characters seem to struggle with their feelings for the opposite sex.Below the surface, trouble is still brewing.  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has been given a secret mission by Voldemort.  And Dumbledore has some memories and a mission of his own for Harry.  Will these missions mean that good can triumph over evil?Let's start by being honest.  Odds are if you aren't familiar with the characters, you probably won't get what's happening here.  There are just too many of them and they are introduced too quickly with little to no explanation or back story.  If you have seen the previous movies, you should be fine.  But don't even think about making this your introduction to the Harry Potter world.The other word of warning is to not go into the movie expecting the book.  You will probably be most disappointed by that here.  Instead of giving us lots of backstory on tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort, the film focuses more on the romantic stories.  I've got to admit, I enjoyed that.  I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a Harry Potter film.  Plus we really get the return of Quidditch, which also provided some laughs.However, this emphasis cut down on the amount of time we could focus on the story.  And this story really sets things up for the final book (or final two movies).  I think enough of the pieces were presented that you can just watch the movies and understand what is to come.  But one plot point I thought was important did get dropped.  I guess we'll see how they proceed from here.I found the PG rating surprising at first, but I think it works.  Even with the romance playing such a key part of the movie, it is still more innocent in tone than the previous two movies.  That's not to say that the climax isn't dark, but it also isn't long and drawn out, which really improves the pacing.  It does leave one character's actions in doubt, but it's a minor point over all.Frankly, none of the movies have been completely faithful to the books, but this one seems the worst of the lot.  If you haven't read the books, you won't notice the difference.

I am sad to say that you CAN believe the negative reviews as far as the absolutely ABYSMAL lighting in this film.  It is not a bad transfer, it was due to some pretty dubious choices made by both the director and the Director of Photography and I am sure the production designer had some say in it also.  Almost every scene is just way too dark, many times very hard to even SEE what is going on and many other times the images become devoid of color as well.I watch on a calibrated Pioneer Kuro 50inch plasma display with an Oppo BD player, so I am pretty sure it is not my equipment causing the perceived picture problems.  Even after readjusting both the contrast and brightness controls to try and brighten things up, it was pretty useless.  The picture information just wasn't there to brighten and only caused it to just basically 'white out'. Phooey!As for the movie, I am a completest and will risk purchasing the next episode too, but this film was depressing.  I really wanted to like it, and about the only things I could find that redeemed this movie for me were the budding romances between some of the main characters.  Even the apparent death of Dumbledore seemed anticlimactic to me and Hogwarts itself has never looked a more bleak place.I know the screenwriter had to try and stick to the story in the book, but many things were left out from the book that would have been INTERESTING and might have explained the story a bit better.  Oh well, it is what it is.  If I could have one wish for the Harry Potter series, it would be to rehire Chris Columbus to direct and John Williams to score the film.

Books aside, the film leaps, jumps and bounces about from darkness to glee in artistic, engaging and dramatically potent form, but in the end may leave the viewer scratching their heads.Fans of the books KNOW what's going on, moviegoers may be a bit confused as the why things happen. For one, the film opens with Ginny and Harry madly in unspoken love as Ginny snogs Dean Thomas anyway, and Hermione is suddenly infatuated with Ron - sure, there has been tension between hem since puberty, but jealousy seems a bit of a stretch all of a sudden (in the books it's more of a slow brewing issue.)Without too many spoilers, ask yourself: how and why does Harry know what and for what use a Beazor is and why does his potions master (not Snape now) sit and watch a student die when the solution should be clear to him? Why is there no defenses at the Weasely house if they are in dire danger, why no Order members standing guard, no spells around the property and why do the Death Eaters attack? (hint, it's not in the book at all!!! so there's no answer.) Why does Dumbledore take Harry to the Burrow at the beginning of the film (it makes sense in the book, here, no reason.) Why does Harry take orders from Snape at the end without question? Why does no one challenge four Death Eaters running amok in Hogwarts and setting Hagrid's hut ablaze?The movie is fast, humorous, entertaining and a wonder to watch, both emotionally and visually. I buy the characters, the motivations, the special effects, everything almost... just not the logical flaws that made me scratch my head all the way home.I do hope they shot a lot of scenes that will someday make up an extended DVD /  Blu-Ray version.

1122211,A3KEZLJ59C1JVH,B000ZECQ08,Melissa Niksic,"[25, 33]","On a scale of one to five, I only give ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" three stars...and that's being incredbly generous.I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film, and there are moments of the movie that are absolutely fantastic. The problem is that all those scenes start off great, and then fizzle out into nothing spectacular. This film also cuts and changes a lot of info from the book, and changes certain things from the novel that had no business being changed. I just don't understand it.Without giving too much away, here are some of the things that irked me about this movie (if you haven't read the book, though, beware that there are spoilers ahead):- The first 20 minutes or so of the film are AWFUL. They are nothing like the opening chapters of the book, which is a huge disappointment. Dumbledore especially bothers me at the beginning of the movie. His dialogue is ridiculous, and the significance of his withered hand are glossed over in an offhand remark to Harry. (Also, that hand looks nothing like it should. In the movie, Dumbledore's hand looks like its owner has merely been outside gardening for a couple of hours. In the book, the hand is supposed to be a black, charred, disgusting mess. Why cut corners on the big screen?)- Also in regards to the first few minutes of the book, I was disappointed that the Snape/Narcissa/Bellatrix scene was pushed back until later in the film, and was exceptionally brief. It could have been much better.- Too much of the movie was devoted to silly romance. Don't get me wrong: The Ron/Hermione/Lavender triangle was a big part of Book Six, and the actress playing Lavender in the film was absolutely hysterical. However, too much time was devoted to teenage romance instead of other important plot elements that were completely cut out  of the film altogether.- Speaking of silly romance, the Harry/Ginny relationship was really shafted in the movie. It started off well, but never really climaxed at all. At the end of the book, Harry and Ginny are officially an item, and there's a very poignant moment where Harry tells Ginny why they can't be together because he'll inadvertently put her in danger and because he needs to fulfill his destiny, etc. That scene was completely omitted from the movie, and in the film, you really don't know if Harry and Ginny are really together or not. It's ridiculous!- Fenrir Greyback's character in the movie was a MASSIVE disappointment. He appeared in the film, but no one even really knew that he was a werewolf, because the whole scene where he attacks Bill Weasley was omitted from the film! Why include the character at all if they were going to cut that scene? It makes absolutely no sense!- Too much time was devoted to Draco Malfoy practicing for his ""grand event."" Tom Felton did a great job portraying Draco in this film, but seriously, did the filmmakers really need to include four or five separate scenes of Draco practicing using the vanishing cabinet? I don't think so.- For me, the last 25 minutes or so of the film were the biggest disappointment of all. The worst part about it is that certain aspects of these scenes were amazing: the visual setting when Dumbledore and Harry arrive at the mouth of the cave, the dialogue between Snape and Dumbledore at the tower, etc. Unfortunately, though, the scenes that started off great ended up sucking. For example, the ""evil souls"" living in the lake were total rip-offs of Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings,"" and didn't look anything like I imagined that they should. Also, I hated the death scene at the end, which was poorly done and happened way too quickly. The Snape/Harry confrontation at the end of the film also seemed incredibly lackluster. I really wanted Harry to scream at Snape and go nuts on him, but instead Daniel Radcliffe just kind of muttered, ""Coward,"" and that was it.- The ending of the film was TERRIBLE! After the death, only about 30 people were gathered around the body, and no one was freaking out the way they do in the book. HELLO! One of the most important characters in the series is dead! Doesn't anyone care? All they do is hold their wands up in the air for a few seconds in some sort of pathetic salute. It's awful! It was so subdued. And where was the funeral?! In the book, people travel from all over the world to attend the service, and the coffin goes up in white flames, which would have been a great way to end the movie. Instead, the audience was left with a boring shot of the back of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads. It was awful!I really expected more from this film. Again, I will concede that there were some decent moments, but I think the script and the overall direction were severely lacking. I really hope they don't screw up the final two films in the series.

Here,we see the darkest and most mature Harry Potter movie of the 1st 6 by far. The charm and innocence of Sorcerer's Stone that so defined Sorcerer's Stone is completely gone now. Harry is growing up and preparing himself to take on his greatest challenges yet. As those who have read the book know,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince really has 2 important storylines to it. On one hand,Half Blood Prince is a backstory story where we learn more about Voldemort's past. At the same time,Half Blood Prince is also a setup story as the events that occur in Half Blood Prince in real time are setting up the events of Deathly Hallows. The film does a brilliant job of bringing those things to life. I was especially happy with the depiction of the day Dumbledore first met the young Tom riddle. That was a scene the filmmakers nailed. I was also very pleased with the way the circumstances of the Half Blood Prince's book were handled,both in terms of that 1st Potions lessons and in the scene where Harry is forced to get rid of it.Then the acting was superb. Daniel,Rupert,Emma,and Alan have mastered their characters by this movie. And Michael Gambon gives his best performance as Dumbledore in this movie,particularly in the many scenes in which he and Harry are alone together, Finally,I was immensely satisfied with the climax. Apart from the presentation of the events themselves,the emotional aspects of the climax hit the heart for me. Even after many viewings,I get teary eyed when Dumbledore dies and when the students are all raising their wands in tribute to him. This is a very poignant time for Hogwarts. In this movie,Dumbledore is preparing Harry for what lies ahead as events culminate in the climax that sets up the major war in Deathly Hallows. My only criticisms are that they should have included the memory where that witch shows Voldemort the Cup and Locket so they,as Horcruxes that become important in Deathly Hallows, would be properly introduced in this movie. That memory should have been in the movie instead of the Ron-Lavender and Dean-Ginny stuff,which should have been cut from the movie (and the book) because it added NOTHING to the plot.  Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a deeply rewarding movie that MUST get 5 stars.",5,Harry Potter Grows Up Brillantly!,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",2013,2364,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'fantastically', 'well', 'done', 'richly', 'satisfying', 'movie', 'Here', 'see', 'darkest', 'most', 'mature', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', '1st', '6', 'far', 'charm', 'innocence', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'so', 'defined', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'completely', 'gone', 'now', 'Harry', 'growing', 'up', 'preparing', 'take', 'greatest', 'challenges', 'yet', 'who', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'really', '2', 'important', 'storylines', 'one', 'hand', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'backstory', 'story', 'where', 'learn', 'more', 'Voldemort', 'past', 'same', 'time', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'also', 'setup', 'story', 'events', 'occur', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'real', 'time', 'are', 'setting', 'up', 'events', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'film', 'brilliant', 'job', 'bringing', 'things', 'life', 'was', 'especially', 'happy', 'depiction', 'day', 'Dumbledore', 'first', 'met', 'young', 'Tom', 'riddle', 'was', 'scene', 'filmmakers', 'nailed', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'pleased', 'way', 'circumstances', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'book', 'were', 'handled', 'terms', '1st', 'Potions', 'lessons', 'scene', 'where', 'Harry', 'forced', 'get', 'rid', 'it.Then', 'acting', 'was', 'superb', 'Daniel', 'Rupert', 'Emma', 'Alan', 'have', 'mastered', 'characters', 'movie', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'best', 'performance', 'Dumbledore', 'movie', 'particularly', 'many', 'scenes', 'Harry', 'are', 'alone', 'together', 'Finally', 'was', 'immensely', 'satisfied', 'climax', 'Apart', 'presentation', 'events', 'emotional', 'aspects', 'climax', 'hit', 'heart', 'Even', 'many', 'viewings', 'get', 'teary', 'eyed', 'when', 'Dumbledore', 'dies', 'when', 'students', 'are', 'raising', 'wands', 'tribute', 'very', 'poignant', 'time', 'Hogwarts', 'movie', 'Dumbledore', 'preparing', 'Harry', 'what', 'ahead', 'events', 'culminate', 'climax', 'up', 'major', 'war', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'only', 'criticisms', 'are', 'should', 'have', 'included', 'memory', 'where', 'witch', 'Voldemort', 'Cup', 'Locket', 'Horcruxes', 'become', 'important', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'would', 'be', 'properly', 'introduced', 'movie', 'memory', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'movie', 'instead', 'Ron-Lavender', 'Dean-Ginny', 'stuff', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'cut', 'movie', 'book', 'added', 'NOTHING', 'plot', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'deeply', 'rewarding', 'movie', 'MUST', 'get', '5', 'stars']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1122225,A39SJ6V6QCGC37,B000ZECQ08,Midge,"[81, 111]","I agree with Geoff. I love the Potter series and I love the movies... until this one. I was positively mortified and left hanging with a lifeless conclusion of an almost unrecognizable movie; butchered by Yates.While I realize things have to be omitted and trimmed for reasons of time and expense, there was no excuse for the butchering this Director Yates did to this movie. He didn't trim... he decided to rewrite the entire book to his own version... as if he thought he could do a better job than a billionaire author? It had nothing to do with saving money either. Did it not occur to him that hundreds of millions of fans had already read the book and were expecting some semblance of similarity between the movie and the book? Did they think they would win brownie points with ANY of us by butchering our story? We don't go to the Potter movies to see something different. We go to see a video version of the books we read because we enjoyed the books... not a hack job by some hack director trying to rewrite the series. Where the heck were the executive controls at WB who should have been watching what Yates was doing? And who did Yates blackmail to get the last 2 movies after what he did to this one? It certainly was not a case of talent on his part.I had to reread the book to make sure I didn't miss something. The things this director did to butcher this movie did nothing to improve the story or save money and were completely unnecessary. We have to wonder if Yates ever bothered to read the books. I shudder to think what this poor excuse for a director will do to the final two movies. We'll watch it because we have no choice... but I can guarantee, after the Potter films, I will never, ever watch another movie directed by Yates... ever again. I hope everyone else boycotts his future ambitions as well.Burning down the Weasley's home... what purpose did that serve except to upset all of the fans? It was disrespectful like having someone spit on your family heirlooms. It did nothing to improve the movie or ""move along"" the progress of the movie. It had no useful purpose whatsoever and certainly did not please any of the movie fans and wasted the original Christmas scene... which would not have required as many expensive CGI's as this distorted Yates version used.Same with the exclusion of the interaction with the Dursely's and Dumbledore... so instead this terrible director has Harry hanging out in the underground metro diner hitting on some waitress while reading the daily profit out in the open... while Dumbledore appears outside the metro station dressed in his usual Wizard robes for all the muggles to see.... Not only was this totally in contradiction with the book, it served no useful purpose except to leave the entire audience wondering if they were watching the right movie. A dud of an opener.The exclusion of Kreacher and Harry's inheriting Sirius's home made no sense whatsoever. Kreacher is a big part of the final book.There is no semblance of a relationship between Harry and Ginny. That entire endeavor has fallen flat and nothing they can do will spark that part of the storyline now. There is zero magic between them. In fact, there is much more magic between Neville and Ginny than there is with Harry. Every relationship they have tried with Harry has been a dud. Hermione would have been the only one which might have worked.The relationship with Lavender and Ron was just terrible. Talk about ""over acting!"" They could have cut that part out and none of us would have missed it.Neville was almost nonexistent in the movie and that's a shame. He adds a lot to the stories.Cutting out all of the storyline about Riddle's family was cutting out the heart of why Voldemort is so obsessed about hating muggles and the hypocrisy of it.Then there was this ridiculous Yates version of the potions book. Like others have commented... Snape didn't even react to Harry nearly killing Malfoy. He didn't even act upset as he calmly healed Malfoy's wounds... and unlike the book, Harry wasn't even punished. Part of that punishment would have given Harry an insight as to how cruel his own father had been toward Snape.Yet, Yates completely changed the story where Harry put the book in the room of requirement with the Tiara on top of it... which is critical for the ending of the final book. It is substituted with some ridiculous scene with Ginny hiding the book... ending with a flat moment of meaningless intimacy.The worst moment of the movie by Yates is where Harry remained quietly below, watching while Dumbledore was being accosted and killed... where in the book, he had been paralyzed by Dumbledore and covered with his cloak so he could not interfere. I can't see where changing this scene saved a single penny or a single moment of time. What it did was to be completely out of character for Harry to just stand there gaping while his mentor was killed. This was totally unpalatable for fans.Then, out of the blue, Snape declares himself to be the Half Blood Prince... when there wasn't any reason given in the movie as to why Snape would even be aware that Harry was familiar with that name or the book... other than the fact that he had used one of his own spells on him... but there was no connecting storyline in the film that made his statement make any sense. It was just blurted totally out of context.The big let down was the ending. There was no ending. It just faded away without any climax or closure. It ended with a dud.I don't know what WB is thinking... but they are allowing Yates to make enemies out of millions... hundreds of millions of fans. That is a huge fan base to upset just to protect some hack director who is butchering the most popular series of books ever published. I cannot imagine where their heads are... certainly not anywhere we can describe in public... Just like the idiots who cancelled Star Trek... a billion dollar franchise. Shallow thinking pitbulls who can't leave a good thing alone... and then blame everyone but themselves when they shoot themselves in the foot.Yes... we go to the Harry Potter movies expecting to see what we read in the book with the understanding that they don't have time to include everything. We do not go to the Harry Potter movies to see the story changed or rewritten.There is only one thing that all the fans would agree on having rewritten.... and that would be to use the resurrection stone to bring back Sirius, Dumbledore and everyone else who was killed in the series... including Harry's parents and Snape. If WB and Yates want to change something... then change that! That is the one change we would welcome... and it might be enough to salvage WB's reputation from this hack job they allowed to be perpetrated on our movie series.",3,Love Potter series...

I can generally look at the two separately, but the one thing I dislike about this movie is how they change the reason that Harry does not intervene in the climatic scene.  Although most people have likely seen the movie several times and know how it ends I don't want to give away too much just in case someone reading this does not know the ending.  In the book Harry is stunned and covered with his invisibility cloak.  That makes a far better explanation of why he does not help than hiding in the shadows.Aside from that, I do like the movie.  Again a lot is cut from the book, but the film (aside from what I mentioned above) does seem to follow it fairly well.  I do like that Draco does get to do a lot more in this movie than just sneer at Harry.  Tom Felton proved himself to be a very good actor, which is not something you would have really known from all the other movies because his job has been just to be a pain in the ass.As with all the other Ultimate Editions, there are a lot of extras.  It does not have an extended edition of the movie.  The deleted scenes are available in the special features, but they are not incorporated into the movie itself.

I only hoped that the filmmakers would take this opportunity to correct some of the book's problems with editing and character writing. I wasn't disappointed. Like the book, this film seems more of a segway between Year 5 and Year 7 than an independent adventure. But Harry Potter is not as passive as in the novel, where he seemed to be drained of personality. The students' social lives don't strain credibility, and the scenario is not drowned in filler. There is filler -make no mistake. The film could easily be cut by 40 minutes. But the superfluous scenes give the audience more time to enjoy the wacky wizarding world and to see some familiar characters, so people will probably not complain too much about the length.As Year 6 at Hogwarts begins, menace is in the air. Wizards and muggles alike are terrorized by Voldemort's Death-Eaters. People are disappearing. Hogwarts has taken security measures to protect the students. Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has convinced Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to come out of retirement to teach Potions -or rather he has allowed Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) presence at the school to influence Slughorn, who prides himself on having taught all the most famous wizards and their children. But Dumbledore wants something more from Slughorn, a secret that he believes essential to defeating the Dark Lord. Young Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), meanwhile, sneaks around Hogwarts in a constant state of anxiety on account of a mysterious mission he has been entrusted to carry out for the Dark Lord.Not a lot goes on in the ""Half-Blood Prince"". It's primarily a set-up for the finale in Year 7. The pace is slower than usual, but the film manages more suspense than the book. Director David Yates has made it very snowy at Hogwarts for a white-out effect. The palette is appropriately drab as the world teeters on chaos. The book's single strength was the scenes of Voldemort/Tom Riddle's origins and youth. Unfortunately, those receive spare treatment in the film. That's too bad, because we need to know more about Voldemort in order for him to become a full-fledged character before the final showdown. A script for the ""Half-Blood Prince"" is tricky, as the book has multiple plot threads that lead nowhere (for the moment). But Voldemort's past could have been integrated without completely losing cohesion. That's the one major flaw in a film that otherwise is an improvement over the book.",4,Improves Upon the Book in All Respects but One.,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2589,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'was', 'far', 'weakest', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'books', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'high', 'expectations', 'movie', 'only', 'hoped', 'filmmakers', 'would', 'take', 'opportunity', 'correct', 'book', 'problems', 'editing', 'character', 'writing', 'was', ""n't"", 'disappointed', 'book', 'film', 'more', 'segway', '5', '7', 'independent', 'adventure', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'not', 'as', 'passive', 'novel', 'where', 'seemed', 'be', 'drained', 'personality', 'students', 'social', 'lives', 'do', ""n't"", 'strain', 'credibility', 'scenario', 'not', 'drowned', 'filler', 'filler', '-make', 'mistake', 'film', 'could', 'easily', 'be', 'cut', '40', 'minutes', 'superfluous', 'scenes', 'give', 'audience', 'more', 'time', 'enjoy', 'wacky', 'wizarding', 'world', 'see', 'familiar', 'characters', 'so', 'people', 'will', 'probably', 'not', 'complain', 'too', 'much', 'length.As', 'Year', '6', 'Hogwarts', 'begins', 'menace', 'air', 'Wizards', 'muggles', 'alike', 'are', 'terrorized', 'Voldemort', 'Death-Eaters', 'People', 'are', 'disappearing', 'Hogwarts', 'taken', 'security', 'measures', 'protect', 'students', 'Headmaster', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'convinced', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'come', 'retirement', 'teach', 'Potions', '-or', 'rather', 'allowed', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'presence', 'school', 'influence', 'Slughorn', 'who', 'having', 'taught', 'most', 'famous', 'wizards', 'children', 'Dumbledore', 'something', 'more', 'Slughorn', 'secret', 'essential', 'defeating', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Young', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'meanwhile', 'sneaks', 'around', 'Hogwarts', 'constant', 'state', 'anxiety', 'account', 'mysterious', 'mission', 'been', 'entrusted', 'carry', 'out', 'Dark', 'Lord.Not', 'lot', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'primarily', 'set-up', 'finale', 'Year', '7', 'pace', 'slower', 'usual', 'film', 'more', 'suspense', 'book', 'Director', 'David', 'Yates', 'made', 'very', 'snowy', 'Hogwarts', 'white-out', 'effect', 'palette', 'appropriately', 'drab', 'world', 'teeters', 'chaos', 'book', 'single', 'strength', 'was', 'scenes', 'Voldemort/Tom', 'Riddle', 'origins', 'youth', 'Unfortunately', 'receive', 'spare', 'treatment', 'film', 'too', 'bad', 'need', 'know', 'more', 'Voldemort', 'order', 'become', 'full-fledged', 'character', 'final', 'showdown', 'script', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'tricky', 'book', 'multiple', 'plot', 'threads', 'lead', 'nowhere', 'moment', 'Voldemort', 'past', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'integrated', 'completely', 'losing', 'cohesion', 'one', 'major', 'flaw', 'film', 'otherwise', 'improvement', 'book']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Mcilvoy ""book lover""","[31, 41]","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and I think they have done a great job with the movies so far, however I always think the book version is better than any movie version.  I went to see this with two people who had not read the book so I was interested to see how well were able to understand what was going on without the background.  I also re-read the book a couple of weeks ago to refresh my own memory.A few observations:- I was disappointed that they started the movie off with a scene that never happened in the book; Harry in a cafe.- I had been waiting to see how they handled the meeting and conversation between the Muggle prime minister and the minister of Magic but they skipped that part completely.- the movie Harry never really mentioned Dumbledore's hand and neither did anyone else for that matter.  In the book it was a matter of gossip among all of the students.- they skipped the first memory that explained Tom Riddle's witch mother and muggle father, how poor and proud they were and the significance of the both the ring and the locket.- they skipped later memories that explained how Tom Riddle ended up with the ring and the locket.- Bill and Fleur were both completely missing- Dobby and Kreacher were both completely missing- The battle at Hogwarts when the Death Eaters came in was missing- they left out the whole funeral scene where everyone came to see Dumbledore off; even the mermaid people showed their respect.- I have no idea why they stuck in the scene where Harry and Ginny were running through the cornfield and Bella burned the Burrows.  That did not happen in the book; in fact the Burrows was well protected.To me these are some of the important scenes that were left out.  My friends had a hard time understanding what was going on.  I am glad I re read the book recently or I might have had a bit of trouble following it since they seemed to leave so much out.On the other hand the special effects were great and I have to give credit, coming up with all of the creative things that JK Rowling comes up with for the books has got to be a challenge.I think the actors all did a pretty good job.  The actor playing Malfoy did a fine job of showing his angst about the job he had to do however the whole story about the two vanishing cabinets being connected was fuzzy.  They did a great job on the scene where Harry finally got the memory from Slughorn but then they followed it pretty closely from the book.  I loved how positive and upbeat Harry was after he had drank the liquid luck.I gave this three stars because they left so much that was vital out and added a couple of things that were completely unnecessary.  There was much to like however.  I think this movie would have been better if they had made it in two parts as they are planning to do with the last one.  Books 5, 6 & 7 just have so much information that one 2 hour+ movie simply cannot do them justice.",3,As the books get more complex the movies get worse....,1247875200,"07 18, 2009",2009,2925,"['am', 'huge', 'fan', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'think', 'have', 'done', 'great', 'job', 'movies', 'so', 'far', 'however', 'always', 'think', 'book', 'version', 'better', 'movie', 'version', 'went', 'see', 'two', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'so', 'was', 'interested', 'see', 'how', 'well', 'were', 'able', 'understand', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'background', 'also', 're-read', 'book', 'couple', 'weeks', 'ago', 'refresh', 'own', 'memory.A', 'few', 'observations', 'was', 'disappointed', 'started', 'movie', 'scene', 'never', 'happened', 'book', 'Harry', 'cafe.-', 'had', 'been', 'waiting', 'see', 'how', 'handled', 'meeting', 'conversation', 'Muggle', 'prime', 'minister', 'minister', 'Magic', 'skipped', 'part', 'completely.-', 'movie', 'Harry', 'never', 'really', 'mentioned', 'Dumbledore', 'hand', 'did', 'anyone', 'else', 'matter', 'book', 'was', 'matter', 'gossip', 'students.-', 'skipped', 'first', 'memory', 'explained', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'witch', 'mother', 'muggle', 'father', 'how', 'poor', 'proud', 'were', 'significance', 'ring', 'locket.-', 'skipped', 'later', 'memories', 'explained', 'how', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'ended', 'up', 'ring', 'locket.-', 'Bill', 'Fleur', 'were', 'completely', 'missing-', 'Dobby', 'Kreacher', 'were', 'completely', 'missing-', 'battle', 'Hogwarts', 'when', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'came', 'was', 'missing-', 'left', 'out', 'whole', 'funeral', 'scene', 'where', 'everyone', 'came', 'see', 'Dumbledore', 'even', 'mermaid', 'people', 'showed', 'respect.-', 'have', 'idea', 'why', 'stuck', 'scene', 'where', 'Harry', 'Ginny', 'were', 'running', 'cornfield', 'Bella', 'burned', 'Burrows', 'did', 'not', 'happen', 'book', 'fact', 'Burrows', 'was', 'well', 'are', 'important', 'scenes', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'friends', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'understanding', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'am', 'glad', 're', 'read', 'book', 'recently', 'might', 'have', 'had', 'bit', 'trouble', 'following', 'seemed', 'leave', 'so', 'much', 'other', 'hand', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'have', 'give', 'credit', 'coming', 'up', 'creative', 'things', 'JK', 'Rowling', 'up', 'books', 'got', 'be', 'challenge.I', 'think', 'actors', 'did', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'actor', 'playing', 'Malfoy', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'showing', 'angst', 'job', 'had', 'do', 'however', 'whole', 'story', 'two', 'vanishing', 'cabinets', 'being', 'connected', 'was', 'fuzzy', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'scene', 'where', 'Harry', 'finally', 'got', 'memory', 'Slughorn', 'then', 'followed', 'pretty', 'closely', 'book', 'loved', 'how', 'positive', 'upbeat', 'Harry', 'was', 'had', 'drank', 'liquid', 'luck.I', 'gave', 'three', 'stars', 'left', 'so', 'much', 'was', 'vital', 'out', 'added', 'couple', 'things', 'were', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'was', 'much', 'like', 'however', 'think', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'made', 'two', 'parts', 'are', 'planning', 'do', 'last', 'one', '5', '6', '7', 'just', 'have', 'so', 'much', 'information', 'one', '2', 'hour+', 'movie', 'simply', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'justice']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Now that I've seen them all again, including this one out of sequence, things are falling into place. This 6th film seems to be a transition film or as the industry calls it a place setter. We lose much of the action in order to set the stage verbally for what is to come. Only one new major character appears. That of Prof. Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) who is recruited by Dumbledore to return to Hogwarts. Slughorn was instrumental in the development of another student, Tom Riddle who we now know is Lord Voldemort (seen only as a menacing cloud). We also see the conflict within Severus Snape (Alan Rickman who continues to impress). Is he really such a bad guy?? Dumbledore lays it all out for Harry. Specifically Harry is The Chosen One and the only hope against Lord V. (yes they use his name in this film). Harry must find the 7 pieces of the Horcrux that contain Lord V's soul and destroy them. I think they get 3 in this movie but one might be a fake. Never mind, now I'm confused again. In a more frivolous segment, we continue to see our 3 heroes mature. For the first time (I think), Harry kisses Ginny but hey, there's just no chemistry there...sorry. We also see that Hermione has a jealous streak about goofy Ron having a fling with a ""fangirl"". I don't see that relationship either. Still, it's fun and gives a break from the ominous tone of the primary story. While this episode is not the best it is highly suspenseful and may be the most important from a plot perspective.

There wasn't nearly as much action as I expected and I heard that some major scenes were cut (the final battle and a funeral being the major ones), but the characters and story had me captivated for the nearly 2 and 1/2 hour running time. The CGI was convincing and the music score was much better than expected, though I do miss what John Williams did with the first three movies. They should have at least used his epic theme more than the few seconds at the start. There was also plenty of humor to help balance the mood of the film, because this Potter film is very dark.All the young actors have gotten better and better with each passing movie. I really enjoyed the addition of the new teacher played brilliantly by Jim Broadbent. He made for quite a fascinating character.  It was also a treat to see more of the great Alan Rickman as Snape, but sadly many characters from previous movies are only given a few lines. At least they have kept all the same actors over the years, no matter how small the role.Overall, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is one of the better films I've seen this year and is worth the time of anyone, no matter your age.

Actually, it was better than I expected and one of my favorites. As with the rest of the movie, the plot moves as super speed as entire parts of the book are eliminated. This makes the movie feel a little choppy and dizzying, often. This is definitely not a stand alone film, and if you have not seen the others or read the books, you are going to feel very lost.The cinematography is amazing; it is the best of all the movies so far. The movie has amazingly breathtaking scenes, a great score and tons of action.This film follows Harry Potter, a wizard, through his sixth year at Hogwarts, a school for wizards. Harry is the chosen one, he alone has to the power to defeat Voldermont, a dark wizard who terrorized the magic world and killed Harry's parents. This movie centers around Harry learning more about how to defeat Voldermont from Dumbledore, the headmaster. This is also a movie that deals with character's relationships to one another as battle lines are drawn and romantic relationships deepen.However, tons of things were left out, as always. But, this felt more like they chopped away half of the book. Poof, these parts are no more. And they were important parts: explaining more about the Horcruxes, Slytherin's locket, the funeral, Harry and Ginny's relationship...And did the Inferi (corpses controlled by dark magic) have to look so much like Gollum?It was a very good movie.

Movies would be over six hours long. You need to appreciate films for themselves.

And if you haven't seen any of the others go do that first, you shouldn't be starting here.  It just doesn't make sense.  Moving on, I was a little more relieved to see that this movie followed the story better than the previous ones, but not nearly as good as the first few movies in the series.Voldemort is back and the entire wizarding community now knows it.  Still reeling from the loss of Sirius, Harry approaches school with a restlessness that can't seem to settle.  He also realizes he has rising feelings for a classmate and a rising hatred for Draco Malfoy who he suspects is up to no good.  Under the tutelage of Dumbledore he begins to learn about Lord Voldemort and start unraveling the mysteries of how to beat him.  But he's more dangerous than ever, especially with all of his followers free and eager to get at Harry.  Even Hogwarts is weakening in its protection of the students.  And it's hard to concentrate on school let alone learn in that type of environment.Characters:Daniel Radcliffe:  Harry PotterRupert Grint: Ron WeasleyEmma Watson: Hermione GrangerHelena Bonham Carter: Bellatrix LestrangeJim Broadbent: Horace SlughornRobbie Coltrane: Rubeus HagridWarwick Davis: Filius FlitwickTom Felton: Draco MalfoyMichael Gambon: Albus DumbledoreAlan Rickman: Severus SnapeMaggie Smith: Minerva McGonagallDavid Thewlis: Remus LupinRadcliffe did another fantastic job in this movie.  He really shows the maturity that Harry gets after the events of the previous year and what he's seen.  It was really neat to see him grow that way.  Grint and Watson were also good, just not as good as Radliffe, although they all still work marvelously together.  Carter as Bellatrix is always a hoot to watch, she's got the mad nutter routine down well and you can't help but giggle even if she is a bad guy.  Gambon really stepped it up as Dumbledore as well, he finally had that compassion that I'd come to expect from the books and he really looks after Harry in this one.  That and he is very very brave in the role he has to play.  The rest of the characters were ok, I enjoyed Luna Lovegood again and Ron's girlfriend is a sight to behold as goofy as she is.  But they didn't really take center stage and Radcliffe had the most screentime, as is proper.This one followed the book a little better, but it was still missing several scenes that really made the story.  But it did include some really good ones, especially the scenes with Dumbledore and Harry.  I appreciated that they took quite a bit of movie time to include those.  But still, there was a little bit of rushing in this story and I kind of wish with some of these books that they would have split them in two like they did with the last book.  I think it would have really made the series better, especially for fans of the books.  Regardless, the movie was still enjoyable and I can definitely see those who haven't read the book enjoying it completely.The special effects were ok in this one.  The details were missing again, and it seemed that the good special effects were only brought out for the big stuff (with the exception of the beginning in Fred & George's store, that was excellent).  I wish that they would go back to working on the details, it's what made the first two movies so wonderful.  The music was a little less in this one too, and even the starting song was changed slightly.  Not enough to really disappoint me, but enough that I noticed.  Overall, I guess I just have to say I wish they put as much care into this movie as they did the first.Still a valuable part of the series, and you can't watch the rest without watching this one.  It belongs on the shelf with all the rest.Review by M.

This movie, as well as the previous ones, are simply an attempt by some screenwriter to get his name up in shining lights. The story is quite different from the books. I realize that much has to be cut from the books in order to make it into a reasonable length movie, but there are many parts in the movie that were changed, as if for no other reason but that the screenwriter could get away with it.For instance:The beginning of this movie has Harry in a local shop, (not in the book) and has cut out any reference to #4 Privit Dr. This opening could have been done much better in the time allotted. Quite frankly the beginning of the book is the funniest part in the the whole book.The train ride to Hogwarts is changed considerably, with no real apparent reason to do so. This whole section has been reduced to garbage.The book has Tonks finding Harry on the train, but the movie has Luna Lovegood doing it. Since Tonks is not cut entirely from the movie, this really doesn't make any sense.The Burrow is burned to the ground in the movie, which has nothing whatsoever to do with the book. Stupid.All of the battle at Hogwarts has been cut.The part in the tower bothers me the most I would say. The book has Harry immobilized through this whole part, unable to do or say anything. The movie however, has Harry just standing there, while Snape and Draco do their thing. Absolutely stupid. It really goes against what Harry's character is all about.It seems that none of the students are now required to wear robes. They are all running around in either suits, or jeans and a tee shirt.None of these changes needed to be made, really. It wouldn't make one bit of difference as far as time or money. It is a dreadful shredding of what is one of the better books in the series, and the changes really just serve to deaden the story line, and set up another two dreadful movies to come. I will not be paying to see those in the theater for sure.Foolish screenwriters. What a waste. The movies keep getting worse and worse.The acting has gotten, if anything, worse in Radcliff's case. He always has a stupid grin on his face, as if he finds the whole thing very funny. As he is supposed to be in some very dire circumstances in this movie, it really just ruins the effect completely.I did like Rupert Grint's handling of Ron's character. I thought he nailed it.What bothers me the most, is that all the young fans that made Rowling rich, are expecting a decent representation of the the books put into film. They are all so excited to see these films.

Rowling and the background score by Nicholas Hooper adds dimension to the film's many dark moods and action moments.My impression was that very little seemed to be happening in the way of story development for the first hour-and-a-half with attention drawn more to the love potion moods of the youngsters distracted from their studies by puppy love. RUPERT GRINT, in particular, had some very amusing moments in this vein.But the overall feeling is that this is simply going over ground already covered in previous Potter outings without any really significant new developments or feats of wizardry we expect in these sort of stories. Not having read the book, I can only say that there was a certain lack of focus on story ingredients that made me think I was missing something.Nor was it helpful that Radcliffe, Grint and Watson did not have the clear enunciation of the above-mentioned trio of British gentlemen who really carried the film. Their diction was impeccable compared to the young stars who made their lines indistinct at times.Final verdict: For Potter fans, I'd rate it watchable but not compelling enough to merit such huge box-office grosses",3,"Dumbledore: ""What we have here is very dark stuff!""...",1248048000,"07 20, 2009",2009,2220,"['quote', 'very', 'neatly', 'sums', 'up', 'entire', 'movie', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'AND', 'THE', 'HALF-BLOOD', 'PRINCE', 'not', 'boy', 'Wizard', 'friends', 'who', 'carry', 'film', 'shoulders', 'three', 'great', 'British', 'actors', 'who', 'do', 'more', 'roles', 'script', 'ever', 'suggest', 'namely', 'JIM', 'BROADBENT', 'hilarious', 'quizzical', 'expression', 'Professor', 'Slughorn', 'ALAN', 'RICKMAN', 'Snapes', 'seething', 'intensity', 'matter', 'how', 'trite', 'lines', 'are', 'MICHAEL', 'GAMBON', 'Dumbledore', 'urging', 'Harry', 'fight', 'evil', 'forces', 'engulfing', 'Hogwarts.On', 'much', 'more', 'superficial', 'level', 'have', 'three', 'young', 'stars', 'giving', 'usual', 'bland', 'performances', 'students', 'dealing', 'raging', 'hormones', 'as', 'well', 'wizardry', 'DANIEL', 'RADCLIFFE', 'most', 'colorless', 'Potter', 'role', 'date', 'EMMA', 'WATSON', 'RUPERT', 'GRINT', 'do', 'furnish', 'only', 'lighter', 'moments', 'film', 'dedicated', 'dark', 'side', 'complete', 'low-key', 'lighting', 'interior', 'shots', 'murky', 'skies', 'full', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'such.Technically', 'usual', 'care', 'gone', 'creating', 'dark', 'fantasy', 'world', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'background', 'score', 'Nicholas', 'Hooper', 'dimension', 'film', 'many', 'dark', 'moods', 'action', 'moments.My', 'impression', 'was', 'very', 'little', 'seemed', 'be', 'happening', 'way', 'story', 'development', 'first', 'hour-and-a-half', 'attention', 'drawn', 'more', 'love', 'potion', 'moods', 'youngsters', 'distracted', 'studies', 'puppy', 'love', 'RUPERT', 'GRINT', 'particular', 'had', 'very', 'amusing', 'moments', 'vein.But', 'overall', 'feeling', 'simply', 'going', 'ground', 'already', 'covered', 'previous', 'Potter', 'outings', 'really', 'significant', 'new', 'developments', 'feats', 'wizardry', 'expect', 'sort', 'stories', 'Not', 'having', 'read', 'book', 'can', 'only', 'say', 'was', 'certain', 'lack', 'focus', 'story', 'ingredients', 'made', 'think', 'was', 'missing', 'something.Nor', 'was', 'Radcliffe', 'Grint', 'Watson', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'clear', 'enunciation', 'above-mentioned', 'trio', 'British', 'gentlemen', 'who', 'really', 'carried', 'film', 'diction', 'was', 'impeccable', 'compared', 'young', 'stars', 'who', 'made', 'lines', 'indistinct', 'times.Final', 'verdict', 'Potter', 'fans', ""'d"", 'rate', 'watchable', 'not', 'compelling', 'enough', 'merit', 'such', 'huge', 'box-office', 'grosses']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

If he is the best the forces of good have to offer, then we are Royaly boogered.3) How come Stumblebum always starts off with the line ""Harry, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to do something incredibly dangerous etc etc etc"", why doesn't Potter say, ""Booger off, I'm sick of having to clear up your mess, why don't you grow some and sort it out yourself for a change, why on earth has Hogwarts not burned to the ground with an incompetent fool like you in charge, I will never know.""4) How come when death and disaster reaches out to Hogwarts, the best civil defence planning they can muster is to send everyone to bed? Dame Maggie Smith says in a faux Jocko accent like that women off the Flash adverts years ago, ""Ooch aye children, North Korea has launched a 100 megaton nuclear strike against Hogwarts, noo, please children off to the dormitories with ye before ye warheads vaporize you all, the staff will light a scented candle and hope for the best while Potter sorts it out we hope""..

What I feel were important scenes (for us who have not read all the books) key to understanding the flow of the story were left out in those two movies ... especially in OOP, which left me totally confused.This, thank goodness, is not the case in HBP. The opening scenes in the film clearly establish its tie to the previous movie (Order of the Phoenex) and all sequences within the story follow upon one another ... although I am a little confused about how Snape's potion's book came to be in the cupboard at school and why it was deemed to be so much of a problem that Harry and Ginny decided to hide it away where no one, including Harry, could ever find it again. The book probably explains this a bit, but then, I haven't read the book.The acting, as always, is superb and enjoyable. The characterization of Horace Slughorn adds immeasurably to the story. He is complex and yet very simple and easy to understand. He is very human as well .. and has some interesting quirks about him.I was a little surprised to find out that Snape was the half-blood prince and do not understand the importance of the title or how he manages to have it. But this does not detract from the movie at all. Matter of fact, it's not mentioned until the last minutes of the film and was never really a question to be answered during the length of the flick.The ending of the movie is certainly a surprise (I won't ruin it here for those who may not have seen the film and haven't read anything on the Internet) and was a bit put out. However, in reading more on the up and coming two part movie, The Deathly Hallows, one finds out that the person they think is a rogue and traitor is not that at all. Anyway, it's a jaw-dropper.Technically, the DVD is as good as any made today. The picture and colors are clear and bright, the audio is free from noise or hiss and is immently understandable, and there are extras on the DVD for those that like some background to the story itself.All in all, a fine addition to the ongoing serial of Harry Potter. I shall be very disappointed to see the series end with the release of Deathly Hallows, Part II. But then, the adventures can't go on forever. Additionally, both the concept (by Ms Rowlings) and the films have given us a fine bit of film making and story telling that we may enjoy again and again throughout the years.Definately recommended for all ages.~P~",5,Return to comprehension,1300147200,"03 15, 2011",2011,2531,"['Why', 'title', 'OOP', 'GOF', 'left', 'too', 'many', 'questions', 'what', 'was', 'going', 'movie', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'What', 'feel', 'were', 'important', 'scenes', 'who', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'books', 'key', 'understanding', 'flow', 'story', 'were', 'left', 'out', 'two', 'movies', 'especially', 'OOP', 'left', 'totally', 'confused.This', 'thank', 'goodness', 'not', 'case', 'HBP', 'opening', 'scenes', 'film', 'clearly', 'establish', 'tie', 'previous', 'movie', 'Order', 'Phoenex', 'sequences', 'story', 'follow', 'one', 'am', 'little', 'confused', 'how', 'Snape', 'potion', 'book', 'came', 'be', 'cupboard', 'school', 'why', 'was', 'deemed', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'problem', 'Harry', 'Ginny', 'decided', 'hide', 'away', 'where', 'one', 'including', 'Harry', 'could', 'ever', 'find', 'again', 'book', 'probably', 'bit', 'then', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'book.The', 'acting', 'always', 'superb', 'enjoyable', 'characterization', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'immeasurably', 'story', 'complex', 'yet', 'very', 'simple', 'easy', 'understand', 'very', 'human', 'well', '..', 'interesting', 'quirks', 'him.I', 'was', 'little', 'surprised', 'find', 'out', 'Snape', 'was', 'half-blood', 'prince', 'do', 'not', 'understand', 'importance', 'title', 'how', 'have', 'not', 'detract', 'movie', 'Matter', 'fact', 'not', 'mentioned', 'last', 'minutes', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'question', 'be', 'answered', 'length', 'flick.The', 'ending', 'movie', 'certainly', 'surprise', 'wo', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'here', 'who', 'may', 'not', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'anything', 'Internet', 'was', 'bit', 'put', 'out', 'However', 'reading', 'more', 'up', 'coming', 'two', 'part', 'movie', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'one', 'out', 'person', 'think', 'rogue', 'traitor', 'not', 'Anyway', 'jaw-dropper.Technically', 'DVD', 'as', 'good', 'made', 'today', 'picture', 'colors', 'are', 'clear', 'bright', 'audio', 'free', 'noise', 'hiss', 'immently', 'understandable', 'are', 'extras', 'DVD', 'like', 'background', 'story', 'itself.All', 'fine', 'addition', 'ongoing', 'serial', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'shall', 'be', 'very', 'disappointed', 'see', 'series', 'end', 'release', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'Part', 'II', 'then', 'adventures', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'forever', 'Additionally', 'concept', 'Ms', 'Rowlings', 'films', 'have', 'given', 'fine', 'bit', 'film', 'making', 'story', 'telling', 'may', 'enjoy', 'again', 'again', 'years.Definately', 'recommended', 'ages.~P~']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Plot lines deviate from the book for no apparent reason, and others are created where the plot from the book would have been perfectly fine.The young actors all do great to ok jobs. Bonnie Wright is especially wonderful in her portrayal of Ginny Weasley; although the budding romance between her and Harry is not developed as it is in the book, it's done sweetly and believably. Dan Radcliffe continues to grow as an actor, and there is no question that he is now capable of carrying a film. Emma Watson gives her best performance as Hermione Granger; she is excellent in the scene where she and Harry commiserate with each other about their unhappy love lives. Rupert Grint is adequate as Ron Weasley.Technically the film is very good. it's the first one I've watched on Blu-ray, and it's quite enjoyable.

Ultimately I had to download a firmware upgrade (version 2.1) for my early generation Samsung P-1400 player.  Since my player is not connected to the internet, the download was made to a CD and then to the player.  I had trouble with the unzip function and then with transferring the upgrade file to the CD.  The first two attempts produced a CD unrecognizable by the player.  Through trial and error I produced a CD that worked with the player. The actual upgrade took place smoothly with instructions on the TV screen.  The final result allowed me to play the movie but the limitations of the P-1400 could not give me access to all the features of the three disks in the Bluray edition.  Also the effect of dark shading and other artistic aspects of the film diminished the full effect of the 1080p screen image.  I recommend that buyers of the Bluray version who have older players take the time to download the latest firmware updates from their player's manufacturer and install them before taking an hour or so trying to make the Bluray work or to returning them to Amazon.The negative and positive reviews here of The Half Blood Prince are generally valid depending on what the reviewer expected.  The film's limitations were dependent upon the complexity of the book and the time limitations for a feature film.  Much of The Half Blood Prince is dependent upon the viewers' knowledge of the books and previous Potter movies.  As such,  The Half Blood Prince does not do well as a stand alone feature film.  I am sure time limitations also caused numerous scene deletions and compromises with the story line.  Nonetheless, this movie provides a thoroughly enjoyable next installment in the Potter series.  All of the actors provided excellent performances.  Humor and comic relief were provided by the coming of age mishaps of Potter and crew in an otherwise moody and somber story.

Indeed, there are twists and turns and plenty of romance galore that are threefold.  Consisting first and foremost, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) continues his wizardly quest for good over evil despite the ever-menacing spirit of Lord Voldemort, which left movie viewer's gasping during the ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, second, Harry as possible candidate under the tutelage of Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon)to become his successor, and third, the hyper-sensitive hormones that Harry and his peers, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) simply cannot escape as part of their stage of adolescence.The film appears much darker than the previous two and breaths similarities to the cinematography of a LORD OF THE RINGS or Tim Burton film and other epic renderings that have had a medieval-like quality depicting heroism and myth.  With that in mind, there are high and low points of the film that avid Harry Potter movie fans may notice.  Indeed, the lighter moments are exhibited with the giggly somewhat sappy scenes that show new Hogwart's Professor Horace Slughorn concocting magical love potions that get the wizards abuzz.  Ron experiences his first romantic encounter with Gryffindor student, Lavender Brown (Jesse Cave) while at the same time Hermione appears to have a crush on Ron that has her feeling a little left out; Harry is also game with Ron's sister, Ginney (Bonney Wright).  But there are scenes and characters in the film that simply did not have enough of an impact and attempted to put a bit of a punch within the film, such as the conflicting scenes with Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) and Harry as well as the presence of femme fatale Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham) who looked like something out of Edward Scissorhands with her gothic persona, and the mystery surrounding the Half-Blood Prince and looming suspicions of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  But film-goers will no doubt be looking for the concluding climax of the film that did not appear unpredictable, especially for readers.For the most part, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE was highly entertaining and clich&eacute;.  Harry Potter fans will flock to see the film as they see the intensity of the scenes but may also leave one either empty handed or hungry for the next installment.

There's another problem with Half Blood Prince. Though Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson had their English accents from the beginning, I could always understand them. Not this time. They fumfer and mumble and I could not comprehend anything they said. The older Brit actors--Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Jim Broadbent, etc.,--are fine in this regard. The acting is terrific, and Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is genuinely affecting. The big set pieces--attack on The Barrows, ""Inferi Island,"" the--well, this CAN'T be a spoiler by now but look away if you've been hibernating--murder of Dumbledore (though the subsequent chase and splendiferous funeral from the book are missing). The most entertaining parts of the movie are the ones dealing with Ron and Harry's slow realization of which girls they love.

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a darker, harsher world than the previous entries leading into the conclusion of the series.In the very beginning, we see devastating attacks by the death eaters on London in full view of the regular (muggle) population. Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) solicits Harry Potter (Radcliffe) to come with him to convince retired Prof. Slughorn (Broadbent) to come back to Hogwarts to teach Potions. There's more than just filling an empty faculty chair on the cagey wizard's mind, though.  He wants Harry to allow Slughorn to 'capture' him.Harry returns to the Weasley home to BFF's Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson) and the rest of the clan. Disappearances are still happening and many parents do not want their children to return to Hogwarts.  Even Hermoine's muggle family don't want her back.Next, we move to Severus Snape (Rickman) taking an oath to protect Draco Malfoy (Felton) and help him carry out the mission Voldemort has pressed upon him.Definitely an excellent setup for a film where a lot has to happen even in a three-hour timespan.  The cast is getting older. Harry and Hermione are both suffering the blues when their respective love interests are turning to others. Dumbledore is relying more and more on Harry who has learned to simply go with it. Of course, there are the usual intrigues and Quidditch games as well.This is not my favorite HP film, but definitely one I would own and very much worth the time to see it on opening night.

Crawford,"[1, 1]","As a parent who has not read the books but watched the films with my kids more times than I can count, I was looking forward to this film.  They saw it in the theatre and were very critical of it as omitting so much that it made little sense and was not a good cinema experience.I think that their criticisms are essentially correct.  It was very difficult for me to understand what exactly was going on - there are many sequences that appear to have been filmed with the assumption that viewers had read the book.  What you get are the actors standing there, implying something significant yet explaining only the basics (e.g. the secret that the new character has in his mind, but not what the new character is doing when she forces Snape, with some ambivalence, to take the unbreakable oath).  That greatly lessens the enjoyment for casual viewers like myself.  Moreover, while there is plenty of action, there are many scenes are low key and quiet, with abrupt shifts to new scenes that are awkward from a storytelling point of view (e.g. Harry suddenly appears in Dumbledore's inner sanctum and they are working on memories stored in these vials).  At one point, the bad guys are in Hogwarts and they destroy some stuff and then that is all you hear from them - they just walk off.  It made little sense to me.One of the strengths of the film is the advancement of the characters' personal lives, as couples begin to form in young love.  This is quite fun and romantic.REcommended.

He did not.I gave Yates credit for creating a workable adaption of Order Of The Phoenix.  That was a very difficult book to make into a single film.The Half Blood Prince lacks heart.Yates nails the romantic relationships (Lavender is especially great), but this film is almost completely humorless.  No chaos, no ghosts, no delight, no madness, no fun.  It's dark, and it's only going to get darker.  Yawn.The biggest travesty is Jenny and Harry's first kiss.  That was a fantastic moment in the book, which Yates inexplicably made Hollywood ordinary.Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore, yet again, misses the character.  The actor steadfastly stated that he refused to read the books.  I'm not sure WHY he thought that this would benefit his characterization.  It does not.

1122301,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000ZECQ08,Robert Moore,"[19, 27]","Warning!  Major spoilers in review!  If you haven't read the books or see the movie, don't read!The first two Harry Potter movies managed to sum up the contents of the books upon which they were based, but because the books themselves weren't terribly good (the series as a whole is a masterpiece, but not based on the first two books), the movies were terribly good.  There was none of the darkness, danger, and depth of the later novels.  The final three novels in the series turn the Harry Potter series from a merely good series, to what is quite probably the finest long series of books ever written for children (though adults will find them quite as good).  Unfortunately for the films, the books are simply too complex and deep to satisfactorily compress in a film.  At least that is true for THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  We'll see with THE DEATHLY HALLOWS.  Stretching the finale over two novels may make it more successful, but it won't help this film.I unfortunately made the mistake of seeing this only a few days after rereading THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE.  Had I not, perhaps I wouldn't have been so acutely aware of the tremendous compression taking place in this film.  Huge hunks of the book are eliminated, other hunks are compressed powerfully into rewritten, reimagined sequences.  There are literally hundreds of small alterations, most of them simply to save a few seconds of narrative to get the film to fit the 150 run time.  A few such moments can be forgiven, but the film comes across more as an endless succession of compressions.  Plus there were some odd additions, such as the odd attack at the Weasley's house at Christmas by the Deatheaters.  I didn't mind much seeing the actual attacks by the Deatheaters at the very beginning.  I think that actually gave a nice edge to things.  But by the end of the film I felt like the entire story in the book had been distorted and deformed by the need to force as much of the book's story as possible into a format completely insufficient to contain it.I didn't actively dislike the movie; I was frustrated by it.  It felt too rushed to provide anything even remotely comparable to the book.  Only the very end of the film had something of the same experience as the book, though even there significant changes were made.  For instance, in the book not even Dumbledore can disapparate from Hogwarts, but instead goes into Hogsmead with Harry to do so.  And in Dumbledore's great death scene, Harry merely hides, not even under his invisibility cloak.  And Snape discovers Harry in the tower before he kills Dumbledore, which sort of signals that Snape's role with regard to Harry is more complex than we might have supposed.  And there is no great battle inside Hogwarts.  This is important because it changes entirely the tone of things.  One of the great things in the battle was the way the other members of Dumbledore's Army come out to fight, with Hermione, Ron, and Ginny engaging in their own acts of bravery.  I could go on and on and on.Now, I understand as well as anyone that movies are not exact replicas of books.  But I think that film versions shouldn't gratuitously change the book without cessation unless it produces something good in its own right.  The film ended up with some good things, but not as many as it should have.  I liked a lot of individual scenes.  I enjoyed seeing the always enjoyable Jim Broadbent in his role as Slughorn, even though it was as inappropriate for the role as anyone in film (isn't it sad that Leo McKern is no longer living? could anyone have been more perfect for that role than him?).  I loved Alan Rickman, who is possibly the only thing in the movies better than the books, his Snape embodying far more depth than the endlessly one-sided Snape of the books (excepting the final novel).  And it is always great seeing Michael Gambon in anything (THE SINGING DETECTIVE still remains one of the greatest television productions I've ever seen, and while Dennis Potter's amazing script is what made it so great, Gambon is what brought it to life).  I enjoyed the special effects, which were effective without calling too much attention to themselves.  And I've enjoyed watching the group of actors grow and mature in their roles.  Some of them have changed enormously over the years.  Tom Felton (Malfoy) has gotten quite tall, while Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has grown as tall as Daniel Radcliffe.  And Matthew Lewis, who started the series as one of the shorter cast members, is now one of the taller ones. I really like how the main three actors have gotten better as the films in the series have progressed.  I frankly thought Daniel Radcliffe was not very good in the first film, but I think he has become an exceptionally proficient actor.  I think all three will have good post-Harry careers of they want to.I think fans of the movie may or may not enjoy this.  I always enjoy entering the world of Harry Potter (I'm at this very moment about a third of the way through rereading THE DEATHLY HALLOWS and so had some enjoyment of this film.  But I also found it an enormously irritating experience.  It may be that those who have not read the books might like this more than those that have.  but at this point, has anyone not read the books?",3,The book is simply too dense to compress into a 150

Off with the Minister of Magic, including Fudge and his replacement. Away with many of the Tom Riddle memories that were expounded in the book. No Snape detention sentences. No Dobby!And that's OK. What was left?Teenage angst in the form of loves lost, loves gained and love POTION! The film concentrated on personalities for the most part and the fun and excitement of Quidditch (kinda like wizard soccer).The acting was not overdone, but in many ways subdued with was a point of contention with me. Also the ending was much subdued than the book. The book's exciting battle of Hogwarts and the confrontation with Snape and Harry were extremely suppressed to a minor ten minutes. Damn few wizard battles though the attack on London by the dark wizards was fascinating.The Pensieve and the whole memories smoke thing was intriguing but new viewers who have not read the books may not totally follow.We're rooting for Harry, Slughorn and wondering about who the Half-Blood Prince is (which revelation was much better done in the book). A character dies, a chapter closes, and hints for the next segment make you want more.And the soundtrack score at the credits is to die for.Highly Recommended.[I'm not understanding why my positive review is getting negative votes!

There's something parochial about them, partly because so much of each movie is set in or around Hogwarts. In fairness, however, none of these limitations are likely to bother the target audience. Half Blood Prince is yet again set mostly in the school for the magically gifted but this time the story manages, to some extent, to surpass what has gone before. The plot is fuller than in the previous episodes, and the familiar characters are growing up, thus giving scope for them be fleshed out -- suddenly they're much more interesting to us older viewers.

1122323,A1VABWDOUQLULZ,B000ZECQ08,S. K. Harrell,"[4, 12]","I thought it was the best film rendering of any of the books so far.  It left a lot out but it seemed to layer more information in around the plot proper than any other the others have, without things in the background, newspaper articles, subtleties in the frame...  I must say, the acting for the most part was spot-on.  Emma did the best in this one since Sorcerer's Stone.  She brought a lot more to it than eyebrow posturing, for a change.  Rupert was great, as usual, and Daniel has widely improved his skills.  He has progressively gotten better and better, but he was fabulous in this one.  I like that he gets to explore his comedic side, pincers included.  His potion drunk Harry was a lot like his lecherous celebrity child in Extras, which if you haven't seen is hysterical (Youtube).  Tom Felton really stepped it up as Draco, which in a way seemed to be breaking the wall a bit by revealing so much of his story so quickly, and not through Harry's perspective.  But then I thought that about how the book was written, as well.  Jessie Cave as Lavender was perfect.  She hit it right-on, and that's a big undertaking for a high profile character played by an unknown actress near the end of a huge film franchise.  I actually wanted to be on the bus for HP/GW, but even in the film I just didn't feel it.  Dan and Bonnie had no chemistry whatsoever, and that's too bad considering she's slated for minimal face time in the next installment and we're supposed to buy their relationship 100%.  Rickman, heavenly.  Just superb.  He really stole that film with his understatement of Snape.  The one that I thought and still think just does not capture the essence of the role as she was written is Helena Bonham Carter as Bella.  In the books Bella wasn't punch-nuts crazy.  She was evil and sinister, and Carter has missed that mark from the beginning.  That is a persisting disappointment to me.This installment brought a lot more to the table, finally.  I'm pleased to see the series slide beyond children's film to a real, complex, plot.  The moments with Katie Bell and the inferi were truly horrifying.  The visits with young Tom were creepy and intensely sad, their correlation with Harry and the potential of both boys sufficiently entwined.  That same thing could be said of Draco, whose objectives are grim and melancholy, as well.  The cave scene sealed Dumbledore's fate for Harry as Harry accepted that rite of passage into his own power by agreeing to do everything he was told without question.  Harry's brush with Tom's ring sent shivers of compatibility through him, leaving the audience cringing and piqued.  Daniel nailed a unique body language for his likeness to Voldemort in the previous film, and he sealed himself as Harry, not just that guy playing him, by reviving it in this one.  Gone was the distracting angst of the last two films.  I still think that the grief over Sirius was never really processed in the books, thus isn't in this film.  Nothing in the story as it was given indicated that Harry had grieved and was past it, or that he had set it aside to push through the tasks ahead.  It just became a nonfactor and that's an oversight in the development of his character that is rarely touched upon in the film.  As well, the progression of the plot through the pensieve was lost in the film.  I don't think that what we saw in the film left viewers with enough appreciation of those memories or why they were relevant, to start with.  The missing funeral at the end was a let down.  I really wanted to see the visual display of that ritual, for the characters as much as for myself.  In light of that and the lack of processing of Sirius' death, the series (book and film) lacks a real ability to deal with death, yet the threat of that we're supposed to believe that is exactly what compels our young cast to save the world.In all I have high hopes for the remaining film(s) in the series.  If they are done anywhere as well as this one we're in for a riveting treat.",5,And the pincers...,1249171200,"08 2, 2009",2009,4014,"['thought', 'was', 'best', 'film', 'rendering', 'books', 'so', 'far', 'left', 'lot', 'out', 'seemed', 'layer', 'more', 'information', 'plot', 'other', 'others', 'have', 'things', 'background', 'newspaper', 'articles', 'subtleties', 'frame', 'must', 'say', 'acting', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'spot-on', 'Emma', 'did', 'best', 'one', 'Sorcerer', 'Stone', 'brought', 'lot', 'more', 'eyebrow', 'posturing', 'change', 'Rupert', 'was', 'great', 'usual', 'Daniel', 'widely', 'improved', 'skills', 'progressively', 'gotten', 'better', 'better', 'was', 'fabulous', 'one', 'like', 'explore', 'comedic', 'side', 'pincers', 'included', 'potion', 'drunk', 'Harry', 'was', 'lot', 'lecherous', 'celebrity', 'child', 'Extras', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'hysterical', 'Youtube', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'really', 'stepped', 'up', 'Draco', 'way', 'seemed', 'be', 'breaking', 'wall', 'bit', 'revealing', 'so', 'much', 'story', 'so', 'quickly', 'not', 'Harry', 'perspective', 'then', 'thought', 'how', 'book', 'was', 'written', 'as', 'well', 'Jessie', 'Cave', 'Lavender', 'was', 'perfect', 'hit', 'right-on', 'big', 'undertaking', 'high', 'profile', 'character', 'played', 'unknown', 'actress', 'end', 'huge', 'film', 'franchise', 'actually', 'wanted', 'be', 'bus', 'HP/GW', 'even', 'film', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'Dan', 'Bonnie', 'had', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'too', 'bad', 'considering', 'slated', 'minimal', 'face', 'time', 'next', 'installment', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'buy', 'relationship', '100', '%', 'Rickman', 'heavenly', 'Just', 'superb', 'really', 'stole', 'film', 'understatement', 'Snape', 'one', 'thought', 'still', 'think', 'just', 'not', 'capture', 'essence', 'role', 'was', 'written', 'Helena', 'Bonham', 'Carter', 'Bella', 'books', 'Bella', 'was', ""n't"", 'punch-nuts', 'crazy', 'was', 'evil', 'sinister', 'Carter', 'missed', 'mark', 'beginning', 'persisting', 'disappointment', 'me.This', 'installment', 'brought', 'lot', 'more', 'table', 'finally', ""'m"", 'pleased', 'see', 'series', 'slide', 'children', 'film', 'real', 'complex', 'plot', 'moments', 'Katie', 'Bell', 'inferi', 'were', 'truly', 'horrifying', 'visits', 'young', 'Tom', 'were', 'creepy', 'intensely', 'sad', 'correlation', 'Harry', 'potential', 'boys', 'sufficiently', 'entwined', 'same', 'thing', 'could', 'be', 'said', 'Draco', 'objectives', 'are', 'grim', 'melancholy', 'as', 'well', 'cave', 'scene', 'sealed', 'Dumbledore', 'fate', 'Harry', 'Harry', 'accepted', 'rite', 'passage', 'own', 'power', 'agreeing', 'do', 'everything', 'was', 'told', 'question', 'Harry', 'brush', 'Tom', 'ring', 'sent', 'shivers', 'compatibility', 'leaving', 'audience', 'cringing', 'piqued', 'Daniel', 'nailed', 'unique', 'body', 'language', 'likeness', 'Voldemort', 'previous', 'film', 'sealed', 'Harry', 'not', 'just', 'guy', 'playing', 'reviving', 'one', 'Gone', 'was', 'distracting', 'angst', 'last', 'two', 'films', 'still', 'think', 'grief', 'Sirius', 'was', 'never', 'really', 'processed', 'books', 'thus', ""n't"", 'film', 'Nothing', 'story', 'was', 'given', 'indicated', 'Harry', 'had', 'grieved', 'was', 'had', 'set', 'aside', 'push', 'tasks', 'ahead', 'just', 'became', 'nonfactor', 'oversight', 'development', 'character', 'rarely', 'touched', 'film', 'well', 'progression', 'plot', 'pensieve', 'was', 'lost', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'what', 'saw', 'film', 'left', 'viewers', 'enough', 'appreciation', 'memories', 'why', 'were', 'relevant', 'start', 'missing', 'funeral', 'end', 'was', 'let', 'down', 'really', 'wanted', 'see', 'visual', 'display', 'ritual', 'characters', 'as', 'much', 'myself', 'light', 'lack', 'processing', 'Sirius', 'death', 'series', 'book', 'film', 'real', 'ability', 'deal', 'death', 'yet', 'threat', ""'re"", 'supposed', 'believe', 'exactly', 'what', 'young', 'cast', 'save', 'world.In', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'remaining', 'film', 's', 'series', 'are', 'done', 'anywhere', 'as', 'well', 'one', ""'re"", 'riveting', 'treat']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122324,A3KKM0T1KY42HA,B000ZECQ08,Sky,"[2, 3]","Is it over yet? That's what I was thinking as this 6th installment of the Harry Potter series unfolded in front of me. Then when it actually did end my kids and I said almost in unison, ""That's the end?!?"" Wow. If ever I've seen a movie that was pure filler until the next installment...Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was it! What a completely forgettable movie.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire & Order of the Phoenix were all at minimum very good. Certainly Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as memorable as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, and Order of the Phoenix, was also a bit drawn out, but still pretty good.The A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on and on in this series of films....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticeably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Aloneand tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very often. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens whose debuts now seem so long ago.Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (prior toChildren of Men). Columbus still had oversight as a producer to Azkaban, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really showed through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell (Donnie Brasco), 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.The Dirctor's Chair went to a relatively inexperienced David Yates for Order of the Phoenix, but at least Yates stayed the course started by Newell and kept the darkness (and the PG-13) in. Yates' directional talents are clearly inferior to his predecessors, and it really shows in Half Blood Prince. Either the main cast has lost their heart or Yates simply could not get out of his cast what they were once capable of. It is mostly Radcliffe's, Watson's, Grint's and especially Tom Felton's (Malfoy) performances that were blatantly lacking. Maybe now that this crew has grown up, it simply turns out that as adults they can't act. But that's where a more qualified director should have come in to finish off what started as a Class-A series.It must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating starting with Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Harry Potter movies. How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example,Alien Vs. Predator, that does indeed not only have profanity, but strong violence? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.I will indeed finish by saying that the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed billions of dollars because--up until Half Blood--they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA. The fair MPAA rating for Half Blood would be NG. Not as Good.Yates is on board for the final two...that's right, I said TWO...in the Harry Potter series. Deathly Hallows is announced for 2010 and Deathly Hallows Part 2 for 2011. Way to milk it, buddy. Yates had better step it up several notches and get this series back to form if he expects me to fork over the Blu Ray bucks for Hallows instead of waiting for cable.Is this rambling, long-winded review over yet?

1122326,AIT3L2OSJNPZ6,B000ZECQ08,"snoogins4life ""brokenone""","[8, 17]","That about sums it up.The whole point of this film, the whole point of the movie as well.At the hidden entrance to the cave, when Dumbledore cuts his hand to spill his blood in order to open the secret passage, and Harry says he should have done it, where in Dumbledore answers with the aforementioned line, is the whole reason for the film and the book. Not just to discover Voldemorts weakness, or to try and destroy him, but for Harry to try and finally realize just how precious he is.That is the main point of the film, and I was very glad to see it.  There were alot of changes made to the film, but changes that I felt were warrented and appropriate. We, as Harry Potter movie fans have seen the big huge epic scenes! We had Dumbledore's and Voldemort's duel at the end of Order of the Phoenix, in the same movie we had the duel between the children and the death eaters. In Goblet of Fire we had Dragons, and amazing broom flights, and in all the other films we had fantastic Quidditch games and mesmorizing magic being performed in classrooms.What I felt the film brought focus on was the relationships of Harry and Dumbledore; Harry, Ron and Hermione; and just the children in general, because as us Potter fans know those relationships are pivotal in the last book, and therefore also in the last films.The deletions made sense to me, the film was smaller, more self contained. It was a relationship drama, not an epic battle film, that's for ""Deathly Hallows"". We fans have the book to read for the thrill of Dumbledore's army fending off the Death Eater's, and the extra little pieces of information. This film was about finding who you are and doing so with little help from the one person you most rely on.  It was about Harry's journey into realizing what he has to do, and that he can't and ultimately couldn't have Dumbledore's help or protection to get it done.On the film side: The kids acting has improved leaps and bounds.  Emma Watson and Tom Felton (Hermione and Draco) were both very impressive, particularly Tom as Draco especially in the bathroom sequence and in the clock tower. Rupert Grint as Ron has shown just how great of a comic actor he can be.  Daniel as Harry is phenomenal and has improved leaps and bounds since Goblet of Fire.  The stand out performances for adults were the AMAZING Michael Gambon as Dumbledore who brought tears to my eyes with his powerful and stunningly gut wrenching performance.  Jim Broadbent as Horace Slughorn the new Potions teacher was delightfully funny and also a bit sad as well with his distant and pale sadness.  Helena Bonaham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange was amazingly insane and evil in this one, loved her, and although under used, I always adore every second of time Alan Rickman's Severus Snape is on screen.The effects were amazing as well, and unlike a few of the previous films the were in no way meant to be a spectacle, in fact most of them seemed rather in the back ground letting the characters be the main attraction.  The cave of the Horocrux sequence was impressive (the infiri were CREEPY!)  And the burning of the burrow was rather impressive even with the saddness of the scene.The tone of the film all though the films rating was PG rather than PG-13 like Goblet and Order before it, was actually much darker, which allowed the teen romance to give a great balance and needed lift to the whole affair.  I loved the film from start to finish, it was well made, well acted, and well thought through.I know ALOT of people will fuss at my lack of caring that alot of stuff was changed or that things were added or omitted, I simple feel that the film worked well as a character piece about love and loss, and what is needed to take action and move on and discover your meaning; and this was the purpose of this film, in my opinion.",5,"""Your Blood Is More Precious Than Mine""",1247702400,"07 16, 2009",2009,3820,"['sums', 'up.The', 'whole', 'point', 'film', 'whole', 'point', 'movie', 'well.At', 'hidden', 'entrance', 'cave', 'when', 'Dumbledore', 'hand', 'spill', 'blood', 'order', 'open', 'secret', 'passage', 'Harry', 'should', 'have', 'done', 'where', 'Dumbledore', 'answers', 'aforementioned', 'line', 'whole', 'reason', 'film', 'book', 'Not', 'just', 'discover', 'Voldemorts', 'weakness', 'try', 'destroy', 'Harry', 'try', 'finally', 'realize', 'just', 'how', 'precious', 'main', 'point', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'glad', 'see', 'were', 'alot', 'changes', 'made', 'film', 'felt', 'were', 'warrented', 'appropriate', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'movie', 'fans', 'have', 'seen', 'big', 'huge', 'epic', 'scenes', 'had', 'Dumbledore', 'Voldemort', 'duel', 'end', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'same', 'movie', 'had', 'duel', 'children', 'death', 'eaters', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'had', 'Dragons', 'amazing', 'broom', 'flights', 'other', 'films', 'had', 'fantastic', 'Quidditch', 'games', 'mesmorizing', 'magic', 'being', 'performed', 'classrooms.What', 'felt', 'film', 'brought', 'focus', 'was', 'relationships', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Hermione', 'just', 'children', 'general', 'Potter', 'fans', 'know', 'relationships', 'are', 'pivotal', 'last', 'book', 'therefore', 'also', 'last', 'films.The', 'deletions', 'made', 'sense', 'film', 'was', 'smaller', 'more', 'self', 'contained', 'was', 'relationship', 'drama', 'not', 'epic', 'battle', 'film', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'fans', 'have', 'book', 'read', 'thrill', 'Dumbledore', 'army', 'fending', 'Death', 'Eater', 'extra', 'little', 'pieces', 'information', 'film', 'was', 'finding', 'who', 'are', 'doing', 'so', 'little', 'help', 'one', 'person', 'most', 'rely', 'was', 'Harry', 'journey', 'realizing', 'what', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'ultimately', 'could', ""n't"", 'have', 'Dumbledore', 'help', 'protection', 'get', 'done.On', 'film', 'side', 'kids', 'acting', 'improved', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'Hermione', 'Draco', 'were', 'very', 'impressive', 'particularly', 'Tom', 'Draco', 'especially', 'bathroom', 'sequence', 'clock', 'tower', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Ron', 'shown', 'just', 'how', 'great', 'comic', 'actor', 'can', 'be', 'Daniel', 'Harry', 'phenomenal', 'improved', 'leaps', 'bounds', 'Goblet', 'Fire', 'stand', 'out', 'performances', 'adults', 'were', 'AMAZING', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Dumbledore', 'who', 'brought', 'tears', 'eyes', 'powerful', 'stunningly', 'gut', 'wrenching', 'performance', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'new', 'Potions', 'teacher', 'was', 'delightfully', 'funny', 'also', 'bit', 'sad', 'well', 'distant', 'pale', 'sadness', 'Helena', 'Bonaham', 'Carter', 'Bellatrix', 'Lestrange', 'was', 'amazingly', 'insane', 'evil', 'one', 'loved', 'used', 'always', 'adore', 'second', 'time', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'Severus', 'Snape', 'screen.The', 'effects', 'were', 'amazing', 'as', 'well', 'few', 'previous', 'films', 'were', 'way', 'meant', 'be', 'spectacle', 'fact', 'most', 'seemed', 'rather', 'back', 'ground', 'letting', 'characters', 'be', 'main', 'attraction', 'cave', 'Horocrux', 'sequence', 'was', 'impressive', 'infiri', 'were', 'CREEPY', 'burning', 'burrow', 'was', 'rather', 'impressive', 'even', 'saddness', 'scene.The', 'tone', 'film', 'films', 'rating', 'was', 'PG', 'rather', 'PG-13', 'Goblet', 'Order', 'was', 'actually', 'much', 'darker', 'allowed', 'teen', 'romance', 'give', 'great', 'balance', 'needed', 'lift', 'whole', 'affair', 'loved', 'film', 'start', 'finish', 'was', 'well', 'made', 'well', 'acted', 'well', 'thought', 'through.I', 'know', 'ALOT', 'people', 'will', 'fuss', 'lack', 'caring', 'alot', 'stuff', 'was', 'changed', 'things', 'were', 'added', 'omitted', 'simple', 'feel', 'film', 'worked', 'well', 'character', 'piece', 'love', 'loss', 'what', 'needed', 'take', 'action', 'move', 'discover', 'meaning', 'was', 'purpose', 'film', 'opinion']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The film follows the basic storyline of the book, but some details are perhaps necessarily sidestepped.  Harry's growing attraction toward Ginny Weasley is minimized, as is Harry's struggle with the fact that she's his best friend's sister and how Harry is troubled as to how any budding romance might affect his friendship is mostly missing.  Likewise, the setup for Harry using the beozar is effectively absent, where in the book, it's prominent.  The film does carry the fundamental story along, but some of the things that were in the original are minimized or missing.The film carries the basic storyline along, but it sheds some important details.  The whole subplot about Mrs. Weasley, Bill Weasley, and Fleur is missing, and that Fleur and Bill's impending weddingis an important element for the final story.

1122331,A171FU7AC9YYMS,B000ZECQ08,"Steve Forsyth ""sforsythnoe""","[1, 2]","Through five previous films, this title, and two more to go, we've watched our little friends and the actors who portray them grow up before our eyes!  This, in itself, has made the series fun and enjoyable.  I read the books, and enjoyed the previous film adaptations, but this was the first film I left the theater disappointed.The original film tried to pack every detail from the book into its already lengthy running time, resulting in a breakneck pace that gave the viewer little time to really hone in on the characters.  The following two films, in my opinion the pinnacle of the film series, found just the right beat, with few sacrifices.  The fourth film, based as it was on a book three times longer, still managed to bring a fantastic adaptation, even with drastic amounts of material cut. The fifth film, Order of the Phoenix, was the first I thought should have been better, even while subsequent viewings have made me appreciate it all the more.But now, the sixth film in the series, I found myself for the first time really feeling disappointed as I left the theater, feeling like the whole thing was a waste of time.  My second viewing, here on DVD, went much better, yet I STILL feel the end of this film is a huge letdown.The key to enjoying these latter films is divorcing them completely from the books.  If you overlook the glaring amount of material missing and just take them as their own creations, they are quite enjoyable.  Bearing that in mind, for the purpose of this review, I will not be referring to the book anymore - that approach is already done to death here.  The book is the book, the movie is the movie. Yet even with this tactic, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, comes up short.The film begins with Harry meeting Horace Slughorn, the new potions professor, who Dumbledore wants Harry to get close to in order to retrieve a secret memory regarding Voldemort's days at Hogwarts.  With this information, Dumbledore hopes to reveal the Dark Lord's weakness to aid in the coming final battle.  This, in a nutshell, is the thrust of the film. The first two-thirds contain all the usual charm and fun we've come to enjoy in the series.  Best of all, the content has matured with the characters, so the humor is not nearly so childish, nor are the themes.  There are some truly terrifying images in this film (particularly a disturbing near death experience encountered by one of the female students midway through).  The majority of the film, in other words, works quite well.The problem is twofold:  firstly, at this point Ron and Hermione are nearly side characters, whose scenes come and go quickly, as though getting them out of the way.  The story is now focused almost solely on Harry's quest to overcome Voldemort.  This leaves little for Ron and Hermione to do but get embroiled in romance problems in the background. Other beloved characters, such as Hagrid, Crabbe and Goyle, Neville, and the Phoenix members are reduced to mere cameos.  Some, like the Durselys, are wholly absent.The larger problem, though, comes in the film's final conflict.  Whereas ORDER OF THE PHOENIX built to one of the most jaw-droppingly awesome moments in the entire franchise, the finale of this film was markedly less exciting.  Without giving too much away, we learn that one student's entire year came down to setting one series of events into motion, yet we never really see what was so vital in what he was doing.  When it comes down to it, the deed needing to be done is carried out by someone who was already at Hogwarts all along.Furthermore, when we learn who the titular ""half-blood prince"" is, it's almost an afterthought.  The character literally says, ""yes, I'm the half-blood prince"" and then walks off the scene.  No follow up, no conversation about what this means and why its important.  It's a tremendously weak moment in an overwhelmingly weak ending.  Worst of all, unlike the previuos films, we are left with no real concluding moment - just more of a ""to be continued"" style ending, much like the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS ending.  Perhaps the concluding films will make up for this, but as it stands, the film is almost completely undone by this underwhelming ending.To compound matters, the image quality is horrendous.  The film itself was lit and graded very darkly, but coupled with Warner Bros. typically shoddy transfer, and you are left with a badly artifacted, dark, and dreary image most of the way through.At the end of the day, even with a lackluster ending, I still enjoyed the film, even if it stands currently as the weakest in the series (to be fair, the book is also my least favorite).  Coupled with the poor image, its hard to endorse this product.  I feel generous giving it three stars, but that is totally due to the quality of the actors, music, effects, and direction.  Thankfully, these areas still stand firm!",3,A rushed ending and Warner Bros. bad DVD image quality mar what could have been a fine entry in the series.,1290384000,"11 22, 2010",2010,4864,"['five',

1122337,A369SQ6E2IP3G5,B000ZECQ08,Susan Shams,"[5, 6]","This movie is horrid. I waited so long to watch this movie, and was really excited to see it. I wasn't a big fan of 'The Order of the Phoenix', but even though alot of the story was changed or left out, it wasn't to the extent of this piece of garbage. From the first scene in which Harry was sitting in a diner getting hit on by a waitress, I knew that things were not looking good. What happened to the opening when Dumbeldore picks up Harry from the Dursley's house, and explains about him having to live in their house until he was 17 in order for him to remain safe? Is that not important to the story? What about Dumbeldores blackened hand, and the mystery behind it? And for goodness sakes, why on earth was that man for Slughorn cast? He didn't fit the description of him at all, and in the beginning in which Dumbeldore takes Harry to 'convince' Slughorn to teach at Hogwarts, is so awkward and with no explanation, it was confusing. So much was left out, Fleur and Bill werent even mentioned or seen in the movie and the next book begins with their wedding. I wonder how that will be explained.. The ending was by far the worst part of the movie ever. You had Harry prowling around while Draco and Snape took care of Dumbeldore and what is really amusing is that nobody seemed to care. Snape strolls out of the school with his Deatheater buddies like theyre going out for a cup of tea and Harry reluctantly follows them. The gripping climatic ending was missing, Dumbeldores funeral was bypassed so that all the wizards and witches could hold up their wands like 'candles in the wind' in memory of Dumbeldore. So LAME!I could go on and on with one scene after the other about how it either wasn't relevant, or was completely changed. Id say that out of a 2 1/2 hour movie, only 10-20 minutes were actual things from the book. I kept on wondering while I was watching this travesty of a film, if I would have liked it if I hadn't read the book; and my conclusion was, NO. The movie was sooo boring, and disjointed with most of the plot left out, jumping from one unexplained scene to the next, and with additions that made absolutely no sense (why was the burrow burned?) Even the characters seemed dull and lifeless. I saw no emotion from anyone, and all the interaction seemed like no one cared.  Maybe they knew that the adapted story was horrendous and they just didn't give a damn. I really don't understand why the movie was vastly different from the book. They really weren't kidding when they said 'based on a novel', 'extremely loosely based' would be a more accurate description. Boo hoo, for the screenwriters and director, this movie was really insulting to Harry Potter fans.

I was darker, grittier, more spectacular and interesting than any other in the series. Actually, if you ask me, I have vivid memories of something spectacular happening in each and everyone of the previous movies. (The Basilisc in part 2, The dementor's in part 3, voldemort's appearances in 4 and 5, and specially the good vs evil wizard's battle in part 5. Do you know what happened in this one? NOTHING. Yup. nothing whatsoever. And even thou the nmovie was not boring, It could have been SO MUCH MORE. But apparently warner decided the series was turning too dark and grittier and they decided to go back to their roots in this one and make it flimsier childish and stupid. The teen angst factor eclipses the magic factor which is something that ruined the movie.  I want to hear more of the backstory, more of the characters. Like Snape. Which is a character that has intrigued me since part 1. I want to hear more of Dumbledore and his relationship with Tom Riddle. Show me more of each wizard and what makes him tick, how did they become who they are today, take me to the depths of Hogwarts and show me the secrets it conceals and give me a glimpse of all the wonderful things those old walls have witnessed in the lat 1000 years. But but do we get to see any of that? Of course not. All those elements are cut from the movie to be replaced by stupid childish crushes and what not.There's an excellent review here an amazon by a user called JR. (Is actually voted the most helpful critical review). What he said in his review is basically every single thing I ranted about in the car with my wife when we were driving back from the theater. Read his review. It's way deeper than mine and he actually read the book. (I didn't).

Professor Dumbledore encourages him to continue on, taking Harry's help in enticing former Potions Professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts.At the school, Harry & Ron borrow textbooks from the school for Slughorn's Potions class. The previous owner of Harry's copy, the ""Half-Blood Prince"", has annotated the book with additional instructions & spellcraft that allow Harry to excel in class & win a vial of liquid luck.During private meetings held throughout the year, Dumbledore shows Harry memories of a young Tom Riddle & reveals Slughorn retains a memory critical to Voldemort's defeat. Harry retrieves the memory & it reveals that Voldemort had been seeking information on Horcruxes, devices that safeguard a portion of the creator's soul, thereby granting him immortality until the Horcrux is destroyed. After learning the location of another Horcrux (Voldemort has six of them total), Dumbledore requests Harry's help to retrieve it.However, Voldemort has given Draco Malfoy, Harry's rival, an assignment. An assignment that casts a deadly spell over Hogwarts & spells certain doom for the faculty, students, & the school's future.The overall power of ""Half-Blood Prince"", is the storm, that the other five films have been fortelling about, has finally arrived & this is the beginning of the end for all things Potter.

1122348,A2MYUI8IT6UBUU,B000ZECQ08,"thejoelmeister ""www.GoneWithTheTwins.com""","[1, 6]","While the fifth installment provided some of the darkest moments seen in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince displays an even more sinister and morbid approach to the deadly witchcraft and devious wizardry. But with that darkness comes an alleviating light found in the romantic mishaps and jealous tussles between the students. Blending the foreboding presence of encroaching doom with Quidditch practice, schoolwork, and blossoming high school romances, the sixth entry in the legacy of Harry Potter is simultaneously the most mature and the most entertaining, though the days of playful sorcery and lighthearted misadventures are long gone.In the sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is dark times indeed. The school itself has become a breeding ground for danger and deception and the surmounting minions of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) have brought forth destruction even to the innocents of the outside world of muggles. As a new potions teacher, Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), is recruited for mysterious reasons, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) must contend with ominous missions from Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) as well as his growing feelings for Ginny Weasly (Bonnie Wright) and the newfound jealous tension between his best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson).If you're willing to make the five-movie investment, the sixth Harry Potter film is well worth the time. Startlingly suspenseful, tenebrous and scarier than the previous films, with a generously lenient PG rating, the characters have finally reached the point where their budding relationships and daunting trials against the dark arts are almost entirely adult. It's a new kind of Harry Potter film with a Tim Burtonesque feel and wondrously foreboding sets and atmospheres (Diagon Alley now resembles the battered, rain-beaten streets in Sweeney Todd). Harry always seems to be covered in blood or unconscious, Hogwart's security has reached the point of a prison, the spells have turned to curses, the charms into hexes, and the potions into deadly black magic. Even the colors appear washed with blackness or drastically muted. By the end of it all, Harry's going to need an extra dose of liquid luck and the audience will need a hearty round of butterbeer with ginger.Perhaps most appealing about the series is the opportunity to see a group of children become young adults, and to journey with them in their adventurous maturation. Any one year seems inconsequential compared to the larger picture, the grand scheme of mastering fantastical powers and defeating the many avenues of evil. Along the way there are plenty of chances at humor and lightheartedness, especially in the evolving relationships (such as a spirited snogging-filled love triangle) between Harry, Hermione, Ginny, Ron, and newcomer Lavender Brown, as well as several important supporting characters including the many schoolteachers, friends, families and enemies. As the characters become old enough for their interactions and expressions to mean more and for their actions to become more significant, powerful or even fatal, the entertainment is more solid and the story more fulfilling. Even if it plays out like they're all making it up as they go, the tragedies feel authentic and the leads are genuinely sympathetic. Finally the chemistry, adventure, special effects and fantasy can all be taken seriously.- The Massie Twins",4,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Review from The Massie Twins,1247616000,"07 15, 2009",2009,3459,"['fifth', 'installment', 'provided', 'darkest', 'moments', 'seen', 'series', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'even', 'more', 'sinister', 'morbid', 'approach', 'deadly', 'witchcraft', 'devious', 'wizardry', 'darkness', 'alleviating', 'light', 'found', 'romantic', 'mishaps', 'jealous', 'tussles', 'students', 'Blending', 'foreboding', 'presence', 'encroaching', 'doom', 'Quidditch', 'practice', 'schoolwork', 'blossoming', 'high', 'school', 'romances', 'sixth', 'entry', 'legacy', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'simultaneously', 'most', 'mature', 'most', 'entertaining', 'days', 'playful', 'sorcery', 'lighthearted', 'misadventures', 'are', 'long', 'sixth', 'year', 'Hogwarts', 'School', 'Witchcraft', 'Wizardry', 'dark', 'times', 'indeed', 'school', 'become', 'breeding', 'ground', 'danger', 'deception', 'surmounting', 'minions', 'evil', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'Ralph', 'Fiennes', 'have', 'brought', 'forth', 'destruction', 'even', 'innocents', 'outside', 'world', 'muggles', 'new', 'potions', 'teacher', 'Horace', 'Slughorn', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'recruited', 'mysterious', 'reasons', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'must', 'contend', 'ominous', 'missions', 'Headmaster', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'as', 'well', 'growing', 'feelings', 'Ginny', 'Weasly', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'newfound', 'jealous', 'tension', 'best', 'friends', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermione', 'Emma', 'Watson', '.If', ""'re"", 'willing', 'make', 'five-movie', 'investment', 'sixth', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'well', 'time', 'Startlingly', 'suspenseful', 'tenebrous', 'scarier', 'previous', 'films', 'generously', 'lenient', 'PG', 'rating', 'characters', 'have', 'finally', 'reached', 'point', 'where', 'budding', 'relationships', 'daunting', 'trials', 'dark', 'arts', 'are', 'almost', 'entirely', 'adult', 'new', 'kind', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'Tim', 'Burtonesque', 'feel', 'wondrously', 'foreboding', 'sets', 'atmospheres', 'Diagon', 'Alley', 'now', 'battered', 'rain-beaten', 'streets', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Harry', 'always', 'be', 'covered', 'blood', 'unconscious', 'Hogwart', 'security', 'reached', 'point', 'prison', 'spells', 'have', 'turned', 'curses', 'charms', 'hexes', 'potions', 'deadly', 'black', 'magic', 'Even', 'colors', 'appear', 'washed', 'blackness', 'drastically', 'muted', 'end', 'Harry', 'going', 'need', 'extra', 'dose', 'liquid', 'luck', 'audience', 'will', 'need', 'hearty', 'round', 'butterbeer', 'ginger.Perhaps', 'most', 'appealing', 'series', 'opportunity', 'see', 'group', 'children', 'become', 'young', 'adults', 'journey', 'adventurous', 'maturation', 'one', 'year', 'inconsequential', 'compared', 'larger', 'picture', 'grand', 'scheme', 'mastering', 'fantastical', 'powers', 'defeating', 'many', 'avenues', 'evil', 'way', 'are', 'plenty', 'chances', 'humor', 'lightheartedness', 'especially', 'evolving', 'relationships', 'such', 'spirited', 'snogging-filled', 'love', 'triangle', 'Harry', 'Hermione', 'Ginny', 'Ron', 'newcomer', 'Lavender', 'Brown', 'as', 'well', 'several', 'important', 'supporting', 'characters', 'including', 'many', 'schoolteachers', 'friends', 'families', 'enemies', 'characters', 'become', 'old', 'enough', 'interactions', 'expressions', 'mean', 'more', 'actions', 'become', 'more', 'significant', 'powerful', 'even', 'fatal', 'entertainment', 'more', 'solid', 'story', 'more', 'fulfilling', 'Even', 'out', ""'re"", 'making', 'up', 'go', 'tragedies', 'feel', 'authentic', 'leads', 'are', 'genuinely', 'sympathetic', 'Finally', 'chemistry', 'adventure', 'special', 'effects', 'fantasy', 'can', 'be', 'taken', 'seriously.-', 'Massie', 'Twins']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122349,A2KQ9FU7M6IX2X,B000ZECQ08,"The Mariners Fan ""Eriko""","[12, 15]","One quick thing I love about it, the cover...I saw the DVD from the right side and I see Malfoy and Snape. Odd I thought, but cool. So I picked it up and from the left side, it looks like Harry and Dumbledore. I know it's trivial but its the little things I try to smile about.If you've read the book you probably spent a good majority of the movie going ""where did that scene go?"" and yes there is a lot missing. The Half-Blood prince was simply too dense of a book to fit into a 2 hour movie. A lot of the book is building up to what happens and unfolds in the final book, I would have rather seen this film in two parts then leave out scenes (or add scenes like they did). I think for this movie to be fully enjoyed and understood, you would definitely need to read the book.Spoilers Ahead (actually if you read the book these aren't spoilers, just things you might have noticed are missing): These are just some of the more important scenes that are left out: The final Hogwarts battle, Dumbledore's funeral, Sirius' property being stolen, Harry and Ginny's relationship and its ending, where are the older Weasley boys?. There are other parts that are gone, other reviewers have already touched on them.I did give this movie four stars because I feel it did deserve it. One star because its a Harry Potter film, I enjoy the series. Another star for the chemistry between everyone.  It was great, especially now since they are coming of age, hormones are running wild and love is blossoming, its a normal part of growing up. It also provided a great balance to the darkness that overtook the movie. Another star for the emotional conflict of Malfoy, it was excellent. He was able to get more screen time and we see his internal battle. And the last star for, the acting. I think everyone did a great job portraying the emotion or lack there of in the film. Except the ending, I felt more emotional reading the book than what came across on the screen.  After a slight let down of this movie, now the wait begins for Nov 2010 for part 1 of the Deathly Hallows (or maybe not since it's the same director).",4,Crucial missing parts but I enjoyed it anyways,1261008000,"12 17, 2009",2009,2107,"['One', 'quick', 'thing', 'love', 'cover', 'saw', 'DVD', 'right', 'side', 'see', 'Malfoy', 'Snape', 'Odd', 'thought', 'cool', 'So', 'picked', 'up', 'left', 'side', 'Harry', 'Dumbledore', 'know', 'trivial', 'little', 'things', 'try', 'smile', 'about.If', ""'ve"", 'read', 'book', 'probably', 'spent', 'good', 'majority', 'movie', 'going', 'where', 'did', 'scene', 'go', 'yes', 'lot', 'missing', 'Half-Blood', 'prince', 'was', 'simply', 'too', 'dense', 'book', 'fit', '2', 'hour', 'movie', 'lot', 'book', 'building', 'up', 'what', 'unfolds', 'final', 'book', 'would', 'have', 'rather', 'seen', 'film', 'two', 'parts', 'then', 'leave', 'out', 'scenes', 'add', 'scenes', 'did', 'think', 'movie', 'be', 'fully', 'enjoyed', 'understood', 'would', 'definitely', 'need', 'read', 'book.Spoilers', 'Ahead', 'actually', 'read', 'book', 'are', ""n't"", 'spoilers', 'just', 'things', 'might', 'have', 'noticed', 'are', 'missing', 'are', 'just', 'more', 'important', 'scenes', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'final', 'Hogwarts', 'battle', 'Dumbledore', 'funeral', 'Sirius', 'property', 'being', 'stolen', 'Harry', 'Ginny', 'relationship', 'ending', 'where', 'are', 'older', 'Weasley', 'boys', 'are', 'other', 'parts', 'are', 'gone', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'touched', 'them.I', 'did', 'give', 'movie', 'four', 'stars', 'feel', 'did', 'deserve', 'One', 'star', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'enjoy', 'series', 'star', 'chemistry', 'everyone', 'was', 'great', 'especially', 'now', 'are', 'coming', 'age', 'hormones', 'are', 'running', 'wild', 'love', 'blossoming', 'normal', 'part', 'growing', 'up', 'also', 'provided', 'great', 'balance', 'darkness', 'overtook', 'movie', 'star', 'emotional', 'conflict', 'Malfoy', 'was', 'excellent', 'was', 'able', 'get', 'more', 'screen', 'time', 'see', 'internal', 'battle', 'last', 'star', 'acting', 'think', 'everyone', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'portraying', 'emotion', 'lack', 'there', 'film', 'ending', 'felt', 'more', 'emotional', 'reading', 'book', 'what', 'came', 'screen', 'slight', 'let', 'movie', 'now', 'wait', 'Nov', '2010', 'part', '1', 'Deathly', 'Hallows', 'maybe', 'not', 'same', 'director']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
1122350,A1KMG1AIUS00DC,B000ZECQ08,"The Movie Man ""tenebre89""","[3, 6]","Warner Brothers latched on to a cash cow with the Harry Potter films.  Based on the incredibly popular books by J.K. Rowling, the series has followed the exploits of young Harry from his freshman year at Hogwarts Wizards School through his maturation into both young man and wizard, wary of his powers.  The film series has kept the same three principal actors throughout the series; they have literally grown up before our eyes.  ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is the latest installment.We first see Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in a subway eatery, perusing a newspaper that questions whether Harry Potter is the Chosen One.  Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) mysteriously appears to enlist Harry's assistance in convincing reclusive Prof. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent), once a teacher at Hogwarts, to return.  His memories about a former student, Tom Riddle -- who grew up to become the dreaded Voldemort -- are needed to help determine how to defend against and banish the evil entity once and for all.The film spends a lot of time on flirtations between Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry and Ron's sister, Ginny (Bonnie Wright).  Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave), fellow Hogwarts student, also has eyes for Ron.  These tepid romances don't really go anywhere and are tossed in out of deference to the novel and the fact that the Hogwarts trio are beginning to look pretty old not to have an interest in romance, however chaste.As with the previous Potter films, this one is visually stunning, even though director David Yates has gone for a more somber palette.  With its combination of spectacular vistas and dazzling CGI work, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is one of most beautiful-looking films of the year.  Though we've seen  Quidditch matches before, the one in the current film far surpasses them in terms of energy, excitement, humor, and sheer visual splendor.  It's one of the film's highlights in terms of pure exhilaration.Mr. Radcliffe, who's spent half his life playing Harry Potter, is OK but doesn't have a heck of a lot of razzle dazzle this time around.  He's not as much fun to watch as in earlier installments.  This may have to do with the movie's darker nature, but the script does have opportunities for lighter moments that never materialize.I was disappointed that Hermione has been relegated practically to an extra.  She interacts very little with either Harry or Ron, and plays her romantic scenes awkwardly and unconvincingly.  Mr. Grint fares better with screen time, but Ron is never involved fully in the adventure at hand.  He's there for scenes in which Ron and Harry talk about their respective infatuations, but contributes little more.  The romantic -- if you can call them that -- interludes become tedious and slow the action considerably.Mr. Broadbent is a welcome addition to the new film.  This is an actor who effortlessly conveys the essence of whatever character he's portraying.  His Prof. Slughorn is intelligent, absentminded, guarded, mysterious, troubled, and fearful, as required.  It's fortunate that Broadbent is portraying a major character, since he commands our attention whenever he's on screen.Many characters from the earlier films chime in with a few bits of dialogue here and there but are otherwise unnecessary to plot.  Prof. McGonagall (Maggie Smith) shows up halfway through as the voice of caution when Harry becomes increasingly involved in elaborate intrigues.  Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), filmed mostly in close-up, delivers his menacing lines with dramatic pauses you could drive a train through.  Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) pops up, only to fall asleep for most of his screen time, and Prof. Flitwick (Warwick Davis) ambles about more as set dressing than plot ingredient.Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy has a larger role than in previous Potter films and is seen lurking in dark corners, traveling to cryptic locations, and secretly plotting.  Mr. Felton has the knack for looking evil at all times, playing his role with little dialogue and a disturbing sneer.  The actor who really makes a commanding impression is Frank Dillane as 16-year-old Tom Riddle.  Shot mostly in close-up, Mr. Dillane conveys a maturity and intelligence mixed with malevolence that comes through perfectly.  He appears in only one scene, but he's one of the best things in ""Half-Blood Prince.""The major problem with ""Half-Blood Price"" is that it's a transitional film, promising but not yet delivering the good stuff.  It is often ponderously talky in an attempt to keep the viewer up to speed, but memories are short.  The script assumes an awful lot of knowledge on the part of the viewer, and only a devoted reader of the books will easily recognizes nuances and foreshadowings.  I was reminded of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and how disappointed viewers were at the inconclusiveness of that ""Star Wars"" installment.  The same holds true for ""Half-Blood Prince.""  The final scene is really a setup -- even a commercial -- for the upcoming two-part finale, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,"" to be released in 2010 and 2011.  Don't expect all plot points to be tied with a neat bow.""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince""  is far too long at two and a half hours plus.  Though it is always visually remarkable, it will likely confuse those who don't know Potter lore, chapter and verse.  For Potter fans, it will be a delight, as they will fill in the blanks left by the screenplay.",3,Harry Potter Sets Out on a Grave Task,1259366400,"11 28, 2009",2009,5481,"['Warner', 'Brothers',

1122357,A2YKADCJME4FSW,B000ZECQ08,Tom Birkenstock,"[2, 2]","Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince opens with several Death Eaters, flying through the air while enveloped in plumes of dark mist (like the children of Lost's smoke monster), wreaking havoc in the world of muggles.  Not only do they bust up a magic shop, but they also down a bridge in London, killing untold numbers of pedestrians.  If you had any doubts that The Half Blood Prince would continue the sinister atmosphere of the previous installments, then the first few moments of the film should put those doubts to rest with a swift knock to the head.  This time out Voldemort is at full power and his minions have free reign over their world and ours.Each Harry Potter film contributes one piece to the overall puzzle regarding Voldemort's past and Harry's role as his Achilles heel (or would he be the arrow that can pierce the Achilles heel).  In The Half Blood Prince the new Potions professor, Horace Slughorn, holds that next piece.  Dumbledore recruits Slughorn for the upcoming school year in hopes that he will divulge a conversation he once had with Voldemort, known at the time as Tom Riddle, before his transformation into pure evil.  Slughorn views his job as more than just a teacher in a classroom.  He also establishes a coterie of young wizards and wishes who he believes it is his duty to fashion into adults.  Harkening back to an earlier time, Slughron is the type of professor who would call the special something he recognizes in these students as ""character.""  In a bit of espionage, Harry must creep his way underneath Slughorn's wing in hopes to uncover the secret conversation.This time around, the melodrama of high school dating is pushed to the forefront, but unlike in previous films these aren't moments the viewer must endure to get to the world of magic but rather enjoyable in their own right.  The appeal of the Harry Potter series has always been its marriage of fantastical adventure with the everyday drama of grade school.  But until The Half Blood Prince the quotidian half of that equation has always paled in comparison to the otherworldly.  One of the joys of this lengthy series of films has been the evolution of the three main actors from passable children stars to the ideal embodiment of their characters.  The Half Blood Prince also provides all three actors some great ensemble and individual moments to work with.  Much of the high school plotline stems from a love triangle between Hermione, Ron and Ron's new squeeze Lavender.  Just as Hermione has come to realize her feelings for Ron, he has found someone new.  (Although, I just can't picture those two getting old together.  I imagine Ron wearing a wife beater in front of the television while Hermione fetches him another Natty Light from the fridge).  Harry, likewise, reaches the age where he's ready to start dating, but has yet to recognize Ginny Weasley's longtime crush on him.Perhaps the most ingenious aspect of The Half Blood Prince is how the minutia of high school life becomes a major plot point.  We all remember the used textbooks that were seemingly passed down from time immemorial and filled with scribbling, often obscene, of different penmanship.  Well, Harry discovers one such used textbook for his Potions class that contains perfections on even the textbook's recipes as well as some other magical tips.  As a reader, I absolutely love the central place books take in the world of Harry Potter, from Tom Riddle's diary to the importance of the library (Hogwarts just wouldn't be Hogwarts if they had the internet).  As a blockbuster children's author, J.K. Rowlings appears to be establishing physical books as objects of value that are just as magical as any spell or potion.The Half Blood Prince is the film where all of the elements of a Harry Potter film--the ingenious magic spells, the battle between forces of good and evil, the childhood romance--all finally come together, like a supernatural potion, into a perfect brew.  The genius of J.K. Rowling is that, instead of writing sequels for a new wave of eight year olds every other year, she let her books mature with her audience, allowing her characters, plot and prose all grow along with the children who may have read the first book when they were even younger than Harry in his first adventure.  In The Half Blood Prince, for example, the character of Draco Malfoy, who had always been a nasty little pipsqueak, must decide whether he is more loyal to Hogwarts or to the Death Eaters.  In earlier installments it was always clear that Draco served as one of the villains, but as the stakes have risen, even the more wicked characters have trouble contending with the consequences or their actions.Likewise, with each installment the films have displayed stunning visual complexity to match the emotional density.  And the visuals for The Half Blood Prince are perhaps some of the best of the series.  The director, David Yates, utilizes the byzantine angles of Hogwarts castle to cut and dissect the space between multiple characters, illustrating the levels of intrigue that are simultaneously occurring at the expansive Hogwarts compound.  The framing owes much to Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth, another film that takes place within the cold confines of a castle.  The color palate of the film mimics a daguerreotype tan, giving the movie an atemoporal timelessness.  The world of Hogwarts has always been a bricolage of differing time periods, combining medieval signifiers, like wizards and castles, with memorabilia from the 1940s.  To move from the world of the muggles to the world of magic is as much a movement in time as it is a movement in space.It is often cited as a critical truism that The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the series (although, this is not necessarily the case for fans of the book).  I can understand why so many critics make this assertion, and The Prisoner of Azkaban is indeed one of the top films of the series, but I truly believe that The Half Blood Prince takes the prize for the best film in the franchise.  Azkaban is a success for two reasons: 1) it was the first instance of a textual and emotional maturation of the series and 2) the film stripped away much of the grade school drama that had gummed up the works in past installments, making the first Harry Potter film that felt like a large scale blockbuster, even if its running time was slightly shorter.  The reason why The Half Blood Prince is an even better film than The Prisoner of Azkaban is because instead of hiding from some of the soap opera elements of past installments, the film chose to strengthen those aspects of the story, making the viewer just as concerned with who Harry might end up dating as they are with whether or not Harry and Dumbledore will find the correct enchanted object to stop Voldemort.  With the sixth film in the series, director David Yates has finally positioned Harry Potter as a fantasy world of cinema to be considered alongside the likes of The Wizard of Oz, The Lord of the Rings, and The Princess Bride.  You might disagree with whether or not these films deserve a place next to these esteemed films, but as the series draws to a close it is impossible to ignore their place within the genre of fantasy.",5,The Film that Got it Right,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,7249,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'several', 'Death', 'Eaters', 'flying', 'air', 'enveloped', 'plumes', 'dark',

I left somewhat thrilled AND disappointed. Why? For a few reasons, just look at the other reviews here and you will see that about half of them are positive and half negative. They left quite a bit of what I would think is important material from the book which is sad and ruined the experience for many fans and it could have been one closer to the book. It's going to be hard to make the last two HP movies because of this. On the good side the special effects were great and the scenes that were present from the book are great and besides HP 6 being very dark it's also very funny at times and the movie looked amazing. The acting was mostly good I've got no complaints here. It seems each year the movies get darker and this one is really dark, I think it's great and it makes a progression from a movie to another. They clearly didn't follow the book enough like a fan would have wanted but I want to make it clear that didn't prevent me from liking this movie and even buying it. When watching the excellent special features, you may notice how some deleted scenes should have made it to the final cut. Besides all that, there is only so much time in a movie that can't include everything they might have wanted to. I'm not only a fan of the books but a fan of the movies as well and I don't think this one is bad at all, it should have stuck more to the book it's true but the result is still a great movie.",4,Good despite its flaws(3.5),1261699200,"12 25, 2009",2009,1579,"['Harry', 'Potter', 'Half-Blood', 'prince', 'one', 'favorite', 'books', 'series', 'was', 'great', 'expectations', 'went', 'see', 'July', 'theaters', 'left', 'somewhat', 'thrilled', 'AND', 'disappointed', 'Why', 'few', 'reasons', 'just', 'look', 'other', 'reviews', 'here', 'will', 'see', 'half', 'are', 'positive', 'half', 'negative', 'left', 'quite', 'bit', 'what', 'would', 'think', 'important', 'material', 'book', 'sad', 'ruined', 'experience', 'many', 'fans', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'one', 'closer', 'book', 'going', 'be', 'hard', 'make', 'last', 'two', 'HP', 'movies', 'good', 'side', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'great', 'scenes', 'were', 'present', 'book', 'are', 'great', 'HP', '6', 'being', 'very', 'dark', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'times', 'movie', 'looked', 'amazing', 'acting', 'was', 'mostly', 'good', ""'ve"", 'got', 'complaints', 'here', 'year', 'movies', 'get', 'darker', 'one', 'really', 'dark', 'think', 'great', 'progression', 'movie', 'clearly', 'did', ""n't"", 'follow', 'book', 'enough', 'fan', 'would', 'have', 'wanted', 'want', 'make', 'clear', 'did', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'liking', 'movie', 'even', 'buying', 'When', 'watching', 'excellent', 'special', 'features', 'may', 'notice', 'how', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'final', 'cut', 'only', 'so', 'much', 'time', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'include', 'everything', 'might', 'have', 'wanted', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'fan', 'books', 'fan', 'movies', 'well', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'bad', 'should', 'have', 'stuck', 'more', 'book', 'true', 'result', 'still', 'great', 'movie']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

1122363,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B000ZECQ08,Tsuyoshi,"[9, 15]","I have not read the original books by J. K. Rowling, so my review of the sixth Harry Potter film is purely based on my experience of seeing the film alone, not comparing the adaptation with the original. And my simple impression is this; Harry Potter needs a new director. OK, I know it is too late, but I believe I am not the only one who feels that way about the latest entry.As you know, there is one crucial episode involving major character(s) at the end of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Remember, before you actually see this fairly engrossing climax, you have to wait very long. I know the sixth installment of Harry Potter series has to lay the groundwork for the two-film finale - ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I"" and ""Part II"" - so the film's long running time (153 minutes) is understandable. Still, the wait is very long.That is because the filmmakers have no idea how to create a compelling narrative. Director David Yeats handles everything in the complicated interactions between characters surrounding Harry as if making a series of formulaic TV shows. The film goes on and on, but doesn't know where it should go. The suspense is half-hearted at best and the film fails to build up any tension toward the climax. The romances of Harry, Ron and Hermione are told without style or nuance. As to the titular ""Prince"" it seems they forget this should be one of the key elements that play an important role at this entry's ending. But what should I expect from the director who in the previous Harry Potter film wasted brilliant Gary Oldman and his intriguing character Sirius Black in such a horrible way?I am not saying ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a terrible disaster.

Now no one is safe except for those to choose his side. Be it a wizard or muggle Voldemort has his sights set one finally completing his mission, but he must eliminate the chosen one. Harry Potter, is about to enter his sixth year at Hogwarts. This time, besides being closely watched over by the watchful and caring Albus Dumbledore Harry must face a new challenge, being a normal teenaged boy with his thoughts fixated on girls. Friendships and dating is swimming all throughout the corridors at Hogwarts and it's much more complicated than any Quidditch match. Still, Harry must stay focused because he can sense that there is a plot afoot to penetrate the walls of Hogwarts and turn the haven of wizarding youth into a spawning ground for Death Eaters. The questions that need to be answered are who is plotting it, whom are they after and who is working with them on the inside. There are many secrets revealed about Voldemorts past in this chapter, but most importantly this is the point in time when Harry Potter finally makes the choice on what he must do to finally take down his nemesis.There were many mixed reviews about this film, but as a fan who read this book when it was first released this was my favorite installment (Meaning it surpases 'Chamber of Secrets'). What grabbed me the most was this book made things a little lighter after two extremely dark novels. It was a much more human story showing that while there is a classic story of good versus evil in an imaginative world these young witches and wizards are still just ordinary teenagers with ordinary problems. Bringing David Yates back to direct this film was the best choice because in 'Order Of The Phoenix' he brought realism to the characters and deep development within themselves and with one another. Tackling love and heartbreak is a very hard thing to do in a Sci-Fi fantasy film, but Yates nailed it. The story was also very funny as the book was. The characters show fears in the areas on popularity or just manning up to tell a girl how he felt. Tom Felton who has played Draco was finally given a chance to show his acting potential. While there was minimal dialogue until the very end his body language showed true emotional that really worked the crowd. The fact that a boy who has always boasted about being a proud dark wizard can shed tears when he faces his true self was made so believable by Felton. I sure hope that once these films have concluded he is given a chance for more work and many stellar performances.If you agree with this review then like me this will be a Harry Potter film you will enjoy. We now look forward to the final chapter going Hoarcrux on us to bring us the entire final book page by page. It looks as though they want to do the finale correctly so expect nothing less than a PG-13 rating.",5,My favorite year and a very underated chapter.

I was terribly dissapointed with the 5th movie, since it strayed so much from the book. I had high hopes for Half-Blood Prince but I was also a bit nervous. After watching it, I must say as a whole, I was still a bit dissapointed. I know, I really do, that you can't fit everything from a book into a movie. However, what I don't understand is if you have a plot pretty much handed to you on a silver platter, why must you toy with it and destroy it and change it and for what purpose? Yes, 70% of the film was all about romance and heartbreak. Fine, it was very well done and I can deal with that. But when it starts to interfere with the plot, well, then I have issues with that.This was deemed a 'darker' Potter film and yet, besides the end, I saw nothing of it. The romance aspect really brought things out of balance. And making the film PG did not help matters. Changing characters' personalities did not help matters. And changing the ending certainly didn't score points. Maybe I am being picky but for once I would like to see a Harry Potter film true to the book in tone and plot, like the 3rd film. There is no need to include every minute detail, but please don't CHANGE what is already there. Why mess with perfection? The book was dramatic and it's ending surprising, dark and depressing. The movie's ending was just rushed and seemed to come completely out of nowhere. People that have not read the book would even be confused. Seriously, for those that have not read the book, did you even get the whole 'Half-Blood Prince' thing? Yes, you know who the Prince is, but do you know WHAT it is? There was just no explanation. It was just too rushed. The director and screenplay writer needed to spend less time on romantic scenes, and more on important plot points.As for the cast, well, it certainly has improved. The 3 principals do a fine job with their roles and they clearly have matured in their acting abilities. I was very impressed. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore does a good job (though in my mind he will never really be Dumbledore), and of course, my favorite actor, Mr Alan Rickman finally has more to do, and yet, though played to utter perfection, still feels underutilized. Sad, really, all things considered...The special effects are top-notch and flawless and they clearly get better with each film (unlike other things...)I am giving this film 4 stars regardless of my gripes, because although they changed ALOT, the movie was still enjoyable and well, it IS Harry Potter.",4,"Much better than the 5th, but still....",1255651200,"10 16, 2009",2009,2581,"['everything', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'related', 'was', 'uber', 'excited', 'see', 'film', 'was', 'terribly', 'dissapointed', '5th', 'movie', 'strayed', 'so', 'much', 'book', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'nervous', 'watching', 'must', 'say', 'whole', 'was', 'still', 'bit', 'dissapointed', 'know', 'really', 'do', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fit', 'everything', 'book', 'movie', 'However', 'what', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'have', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'handed', 'silver', 'platter', 'why', 'must', 'toy', 'destroy', 'change', 'what', 'purpose', 'Yes', '70', '%', 'film', 'was', 'romance', 'heartbreak', 'Fine', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'can', 'deal', 'when', 'interfere', 'plot', 'well', 'then', 'have', 'issues', 'that.This', 'was', 'deemed', ""'darker"", 'Potter', 'film', 'yet', 'end', 'saw', 'nothing', 'romance', 'aspect', 'really', 'brought', 'things', 'balance', 'making', 'film', 'PG', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'Changing', 'characters', 'personalities', 'did', 'not', 'help', 'matters', 'changing', 'ending', 'certainly', 'did', ""n't"", 'score', 'points', 'Maybe', 'am', 'being', 'picky', 'once', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'film', 'true', 'book', 'tone', 'plot', '3rd', 'film', 'need', 'include', 'minute', 'detail', 'please', 'do', ""n't"", 'CHANGE', 'what', 'already', 'there', 'Why', 'mess', 'perfection', 'book', 'was', 'dramatic', 'ending', 'surprising', 'dark', 'depressing', 'movie', 'ending', 'was', 'just', 'rushed', 'seemed', 'come', 'completely', 'nowhere', 'People', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'would', 'even', 'be', 'confused', 'Seriously', 'have', 'not', 'read', 'book', 'did', 'even', 'get', 'whole', ""'Half-Blood"", 'Prince', 'thing', 'Yes', 'know', 'who', 'Prince', 'do', 'know', 'WHAT', 'was', 'just', 'explanation', 'was', 'just', 'too', 'rushed', 'director', 'screenplay', 'writer', 'needed', 'spend', 'less', 'time', 'romantic', 'scenes', 'more', 'important', 'plot', 'points.As', 'cast', 'well', 'certainly', 'improved', '3', 'principals', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'roles', 'clearly', 'have', 'matured', 'acting', 'abilities', 'was', 'very', 'impressed', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'Dumbledore', 'good', 'job', 'mind', 'will', 'never', 'really', 'be', 'Dumbledore', 'course', 'favorite', 'actor', 'Mr', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'finally', 'more', 'do', 'yet', 'played', 'utter', 'perfection', 'still', 'underutilized', 'Sad', 'really', 'things', 'considered', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'top-notch', 'flawless', 'clearly', 'get', 'better', 'film', 'other', 'things', 'am', 'giving', 'film', '4', 'stars', 'regardless', 'gripes', 'changed', 'ALOT', 'movie', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'Harry', 'Potter']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Stephens ""Seasoned Bookman""","[5, 12]","When a movie of a book is made it's understandable that not everything in a 400+ page book is going to end up on the screen. However, I can see no reason why the film can't contain most of the key story elements. The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, did very well at this. However, subsequent films tended to veer away from Rowling's genius-level storytelling in order to emphasize pet interests of the producers/screenwriters/directors. Whoever was responsible for these messes has a lot to apologize for. Obviously, they are going after market, changing the stories to suit what they perceive as the prime audience for their films, and presumably they conceive of this audience as largely never having read the books. All sorts of extraneous material is introduced and key Rowling settings and subplots are left out. And it's not just a matter of what's left out but of focus. Key gut-wrenching climaxes in the books are breezed by in the film, in order, I suppose, to pack in more teenage angst. Anyone with even a modicum understanding of storytelling ought to be able to come up with a screenplay that preserves the focus of Rowling's storytelling, particularly the breathtaking drive toward the final climax, which is a keynote of her stories and among the best in the biz. It astonishes me that this should be completely ignored by the makers of the Harry Potter films. I am tempted to attribute this to an intentional effort to drive more profit out of the various properties, but a niggling suspicion lingers that they are just inept and clueless, yes, and rather egotistical to imagine they can better stories, which emerge from Rowling's pen, compelling, dynamic, and in every way worthy of the worldwide phenomenon they have created.",2,When will we get Harry Potter films that in some way resemble the books?,1259971200,"12 5, 2009",2009,1757,"['When', 'movie', 'book', 'made', 'understandable', 'not', 'everything', '400+', 'page', 'book', 'going', 'end', 'up', 'screen', 'However', 'can', 'see', 'reason', 'why', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'contain', 'most', 'key', 'story', 'elements', 'first', 'two', 'films', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'However', 'subsequent', 'films', 'tended', 'veer', 'away', 'Rowling', 'genius-level', 'storytelling', 'order', 'emphasize', 'pet', 'interests', 'producers/screenwriters/directors', 'Whoever', 'was', 'responsible', 'messes', 'lot', 'apologize', 'Obviously', 'are', 'going', 'market', 'changing', 'stories', 'suit', 'what', 'perceive', 'prime', 'audience', 'films', 'presumably', 'conceive', 'audience', 'largely', 'never', 'having', 'read', 'books', 'sorts', 'extraneous', 'material', 'introduced', 'key', 'Rowling', 'settings', 'subplots', 'are', 'left', 'out', 'not', 'just', 'matter', 'what', 'left', 'out', 'focus', 'Key', 'gut-wrenching', 'climaxes', 'books', 'are', 'breezed', 'film', 'order', 'suppose', 'pack', 'more', 'teenage', 'angst', 'Anyone', 'even', 'modicum', 'understanding', 'storytelling', 'ought', 'be', 'able', 'come', 'up', 'screenplay', 'focus', 'Rowling', 'storytelling', 'particularly', 'breathtaking', 'drive', 'final', 'climax', 'keynote', 'stories', 'best', 'biz', 'should', 'be', 'completely', 'ignored', 'makers', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'films', 'am', 'tempted', 'attribute', 'intentional', 'effort', 'drive', 'more', 'profit', 'various', 'properties', 'niggling', 'suspicion', 'lingers', 'are', 'just', 'inept', 'clueless', 'yes', 'rather', 'egotistical', 'imagine', 'can', 'better', 'stories', 'emerge', 'Rowling', 'pen', 'compelling', 'dynamic', 'way', 'worthy', 'worldwide', 'phenomenon', 'have', 'created']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

The book is so great it is simply impossible to spoil the movie. Alas, I was mistaken.It was surprising how unbalanced the plot was. Seems like too much emphasis was put on the romantic relationships. So much so that we completely lost touch with the main theme of battle of good vs evil. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ron/Hermione/Lavender and Harry/Ginny scenes in the book. But in the movie these scenes overshadowed the main event - Dumbledore's death and Snape's seeming betrayal. I remember crying over this scene while reading the book, I remember despising Snape. No luck here. The crucial scenes went by in the movie so fast that I didn't have a chance to feel anything for anybody. At all.The love between Harry and Ginny never blossomed, there was no chemistry between the actors unfortunately. Slughorn came off as an old whimp. Where was the Order, where were Death Eaters, where was Voldemort? Forget it, instead we got endless fluffy teenage romance scenes.The only redeeming scenes in the movie belonged to Draco. I felt his moments, although never written, were brilliant. I thought he totally stole this movie.Overall, the movie was just too light, too long, too anti-climatic and yes, even boring at times. Where were the darkness, the tragedy, the feeling of an impending doom? Sadly, gone...I would certainly recommend watching this movie, even just for glorious visuals effects.

He did not ruin the movie! He's only the director not the screenwriter (who adapts the book 2 screen version)2-Too many unnecessary changes to the screen version that omitted the real action of the book3-Although I'm not a fan of David Yates, he's a decent director and did a great job in the final movies (Deadly Hallows 1 & 2)4-STOP BASHING ON DAVID YATES...

1122381,AP3B615GM191G,B000ZECQ08,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[1, 1]","With the possible exception of the first book/movie combination in the Harry Potter series, each film adaption has done its share of cutting/editing from J.K. Rowling's original work.  Luckily, this film version of ""Half-Blood Prince"" (other than its predecessor ""Order of the Phoenix"") manages to maintain its soul despite the inevitable cuts.For a basic plot summary, ""Prince"" sees Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) taking private lessons from Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), where they examine certain memories of a young Tom Riddle  in order to be better prepared for his adult Lord Voldemort identity.  At the same time, the trio of Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) take the next crucial steps in their wizarding education by learning more advanced potion-making (under new Professor Slughorn(Jim Broadbent)) and even taking the first steps toward apparating.  Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) take on larger roles in this installment, while Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) constantly lurks in the background.Like the novel, ""Prince"" is a great piece of fiction primarily because of all the Harry/Dumbledore interactions and their trips into the past of Voldemort.  Despite one key ""flashback"" being completely cut out, the movie does a good job of showing those younger Riddle years.  Essentially, the heart of the writing remains (unlike how it was completely cut out in ""Phoenix"").The acting also continues to improve, what with Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson probably turning in their best performances to date.  Felton as Malfoy also grows quite a bit in this one, and the Weasley characters are always fun to get back to.  Almost completely stealing the show is a wonderful performance from Broadbent as Slughorn.Overall, ""Half-Blood Prince"" is a fine book-to-film adaption that will satisfy both the Potter-heads and the more casual fans of the series.  Though I won't give any specific spoilers here, the end of the film very strongly hints that the action of the final movie(s) will largely take place outside of Hogwarts.",4,"Despite Excises, Manages To Capture Essence Of Novel",1373846400,"07 15, 2013",2013,2086,"['possible', 'exception', 'first', 'book/movie', 'combination', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'series', 'film', 'adaption', 'done', 'share', 'cutting/editing', 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 'original', 'work', 'Luckily', 'film', 'version', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'other', 'predecessor', 'Order', 'Phoenix', 'maintain', 'soul', 'inevitable', 'cuts.For', 'basic', 'plot', 'summary', 'Prince', 'sees', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Daniel', 'Radcliffe', 'taking', 'private', 'lessons', 'Professor', 'Dumbledore', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'where', 'examine', 'certain', 'memories', 'young', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'order', 'be', 'better', 'prepared', 'adult', 'Lord', 'Voldemort', 'identity', 'same', 'time', 'trio', 'Harry', 'Ron', 'Rupert', 'Grint', 'Hermoine', 'Emma', 'Watson', 'take', 'next', 'crucial', 'steps', 'wizarding', 'education', 'learning', 'more', 'advanced', 'potion-making', 'new', 'Professor', 'Slughorn', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'even', 'taking', 'first', 'steps', 'apparating', 'Ginny', 'Weasley', 'Bonnie', 'Wright', 'Draco', 'Malfoy', 'Tom', 'Felton', 'take', 'larger', 'roles', 'installment', 'Professor', 'Snape', 'Alan', 'Rickman', 'constantly', 'background.Like', 'novel', 'Prince', 'great', 'piece', 'fiction', 'primarily', 'Harry/Dumbledore', 'interactions', 'trips', 'past', 'Voldemort', 'one', 'key', 'flashback', 'being', 'completely', 'cut', 'out', 'movie', 'good', 'job', 'showing', 'younger', 'Riddle', 'years', 'Essentially', 'heart', 'writing', 'how', 'was', 'completely', 'cut', 'out', 'Phoenix', '.The', 'acting', 'also', 'improve', 'what', 'Radcliffe', 'Grint', 'Watson', 'probably', 'turning', 'best', 'performances', 'date', 'Felton', 'Malfoy', 'also', 'quite', 'bit', 'one', 'Weasley', 'characters', 'are', 'always', 'fun', 'get', 'back', 'Almost', 'completely', 'stealing', 'show', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'Broadbent', 'Slughorn.Overall', 'Half-Blood', 'Prince', 'fine', 'book-to-film', 'adaption', 'will', 'satisfy', 'Potter-heads', 'more', 'casual', 'fans', 'series', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'specific', 'spoilers', 'here', 'end', 'film', 'very', 'strongly', 'action', 'final', 'movie', 's', 'will', 'largely', 'take', 'place', 'Hogwarts']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

Each Harry Potter contains a lot more material then can be put into a movie. The difficulty is choosing what to put into the movie and then sanding over the parts you miss. As the novels have gotten larger, the job of the film makers has gotten more difficult. However, up until this point they have done a reasonably good job of finding a rhythm that works in telling the broader story (even if it is a little different then that of JK Rowlings).With this film it feels like they didnt know what direction they were going in and ended up trying to do too much, but ended up not doing enough. Characters like Hagrid and Prof Mcgonagall who played larger roles in earlier movies are now just given cameos. It might have been better had they just left the characters out entirely so they could create a less fragmented story line without as many distractions. They also spent way too much time on Quidditch (which JK Rowling even said she only put in for the fans) and the teen romances.This wouldnt have mattered if they had not glimpsed over key areas. 1) They spent so little time explaining the significance of the potions book, to the point that most of the people that didnt read the book had no idea who the half blood prince was after the movie. 2) They left out most of the lessons that Harry had with Dumbledore and shortened the ones they did show. These lessons are so key to book 7, I hope that the audience will be able to follow along.There seemed to be some bad casting with the Prof Slughorn and the young Tom Riddle characters. Each year a new colorful character is brought in for the DATDO teacher. Lockhart, Moody, and Umbridge in particular are some of the most colorful characters I know of and have provided ample material for the movies. Slughorn shouldn't be any different. Slughorn should come off as a sort of 19th century politician or aristocrat. He should be round, proud, jolly, but also cunning. Instead he is thin, aloof, and awkward. I wonder if Jim Broadbent has read and loved these books, or if he is simply looking for another notch on the resume and paycheck in the bank account. Then Tom Riddle was played like the kid from the Omen. Noone would ever believe this kid was anything other then trouble and he does not seem that clever. I thought that Christian Coulson in the Chamber of Secrets really captured tom riddle better as charming, handsome, and mature.Finally, I have to admit that it isnt just the new actors. All of the actors were off key. Even the main trio and seasoned actors like Michael Gambon who have played brilliantly in previous movies felt flat. It is almost like they are tired of the movies. I just hope that the seventh and eighth film show more heart, because these actors will never get another opportunity.",2,dissapointing,1289779200,"11 15, 2010",2010,2907,"['Watching', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Half', 'Blood', 'Prince', 'listening', 'children', 'choir', 'where', 'children', 'are', 'little', 'off', 'key', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'lot', 'more', 'material', 'then', 'can', 'be', 'put', 'movie', 'difficulty', 'choosing', 'what', 'put', 'movie', 'then', 'sanding', 'parts', 'miss', 'novels', 'have', 'gotten', 'larger', 'job', 'film', 'makers', 'gotten', 'more', 'difficult', 'However', 'up', 'point', 'have', 'done', 'reasonably', 'good', 'job', 'finding', 'rhythm', 'telling', 'broader', 'story', 'even', 'little', 'different', 'then', 'JK', 'Rowlings', '.With', 'film', 'didnt', 'know', 'what', 'direction', 'were', 'going', 'ended', 'up', 'trying', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'doing', 'enough', 'Characters', 'Hagrid', 'Prof', 'Mcgonagall', 'who', 'played', 'larger', 'roles', 'earlier', 'movies', 'are', 'now', 'just', 'given', 'cameos', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'had', 'just', 'left', 'characters', 'out', 'entirely', 'could', 'create', 'less', 'fragmented', 'story', 'line', 'many', 'distractions', 'also', 'spent', 'way', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'Quidditch', 'JK', 'Rowling', 'even', 'said', 'only', 'put', 'fans', 'teen', 'romances.This', 'wouldnt', 'have', 'mattered', 'had', 'not', 'glimpsed', 'key', 'areas', '1', 'spent', 'so', 'little', 'time', 'explaining', 'significance', 'potions', 'book', 'point', 'most', 'people', 'didnt', 'read', 'book', 'had', 'idea', 'who', 'half', 'blood', 'prince', 'was', 'movie', '2', 'left', 'out', 'most', 'lessons', 'Harry', 'had', 'Dumbledore', 'shortened', 'ones', 'did', 'show', 'lessons', 'are', 'so', 'key', 'book', '7', 'hope', 'audience', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'along.There', 'seemed', 'be', 'bad', 'casting', 'Prof', 'Slughorn', 'young', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'characters', 'year', 'new', 'colorful', 'character', 'brought', 'DATDO', 'teacher', 'Lockhart', 'Moody', 'Umbridge', 'particular', 'are', 'most', 'colorful', 'characters', 'know', 'have', 'provided', 'ample', 'material', 'movies', 'Slughorn', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'different', 'Slughorn', 'should', 'come', 'off', 'sort', '19th', 'century', 'politician', 'aristocrat', 'should', 'be', 'round', 'proud', 'jolly', 'also', 'cunning', 'Instead', 'thin', 'aloof', 'awkward', 'wonder', 'Jim', 'Broadbent', 'read', 'loved', 'books', 'simply', 'looking', 'notch', 'resume', 'paycheck', 'bank', 'account', 'Then', 'Tom', 'Riddle', 'was', 'played', 'kid', 'Omen', 'Noone', 'would', 'ever', 'believe', 'kid', 'was', 'anything', 'other', 'then', 'trouble', 'not', 'seem', 'clever', 'thought', 'Christian', 'Coulson', 'Chamber', 'Secrets', 'really', 'captured', 'tom', 'riddle', 'better', 'charming', 'handsome', 'mature.Finally', 'have', 'admit', 'just', 'new', 'actors', 'actors', 'were', 'off', 'key', 'Even', 'main', 'trio', 'seasoned', 'actors', 'Michael', 'Gambon', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'brilliantly', 'previous', 'movies', 'felt', 'flat', 'almost', 'are', 'tired', 'movies', 'just', 'hope', 'seventh', 'eighth', 'film', 'show', 'more', 'heart', 'actors', 'will', 'never', 'get', 'opportunity']",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince
