196744,AHBH23N2IIP37,6300147363,Carol Todd,"[6, 6]","I have a copy of this same cover, early VHS, version of Soldier Blue, which I bought 10 years ago in a video store after searching for it for years.  Price sticker on the box:  $59.95 (I talked them down to $25.)  It was banned in most U.S. theaters and never publicized that I can remember. The movie even protects Gen Chivington's identity by calling him ""Iverson"" --were the producers afraid of a lawsuit or what? There is even a town named after him: Chivington, Colorado.  Although it is a story done by Hollywood, the underlying sad truth is certainly told.  Every U.S. citizen needs to see this and know the price Native Americans paid for us to live here in this country.  Overall, it is a real downer.  Have a ""double feature"" night:  Watch Soldier Blue, cry your eyes out, and then watch ""Last of the Dogmen"" to give yourself some hope that just maybe some of these poor people survived.  Even if it isn't true, you can at least try to sleep that night.P.S.  My Great Great-Grandmother was a young woman in Denver (coming there by ox-cart from Tennessee in 1860).She saw Gen Chivington's ""parade"" of massacred Indian body parts that November day in 1864, and she never forgot it, re-telling the story to her decendants until her death in 1913.",5,Based on a True Story Americans Need to Know,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",2012,1253,"['have', 'copy', 'same', 'cover', 'early', 'VHS', 'version', 'Soldier', 'Blue', 'bought', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'video', 'store', 'searching', 'years', 'Price', 'sticker', 'box', '59.95', 'talked', 'down', '25', 'was', 'banned', 'most', 'U.S.', 'theaters', 'never', 'publicized', 'can', 'remember', 'movie', 'even', 'Gen', 'Chivington', 'identity', 'calling', 'Iverson', 'were', 'producers', 'afraid', 'lawsuit', 'what', 'even', 'town', 'named', 'Chivington', 'Colorado', 'story', 'done', 'Hollywood', 'underlying', 'sad', 'truth', 'certainly', 'told', 'Every', 'U.S.', 'needs', 'see', 'know', 'price', 'Native', 'Americans', 'paid', 'live', 'here', 'country', 'Overall', 'real', 'downer', 'Have', 'double', 'feature', 'night', 'Watch', 'Soldier', 'Blue', 'cry', 'eyes', 'out', 'then', 'watch', 'Last', 'Dogmen', 'give', 'hope', 'just', 'maybe', 'poor', 'people', 'survived', 'Even', ""n't"", 'true', 'can', 'least', 'try', 'sleep', 'night.P.S', 'Great', 'Great-Grandmother', 'was', 'young', 'woman', 'Denver', 'coming', 'there', 'ox-cart', 'Tennessee', '1860', '.She', 'saw', 'Gen', 'Chivington', 'parade', 'massacred', 'Indian', 'body', 'parts', 'November', 'day', '1864', 'never', 'forgot', 're-telling', 'story', 'decendants', 'death', '1913']",N/A

196746,A3DIKJP95XTKX0,6300147363,"D. I. Shipley ""David Shipley""","[10, 15]","Soldier Blue was made as a biting allegory of the Vietnam war. It divided critics at the time of its release and indeed, continues to do so. It is extremely brutal but not gratuitously so. The appalling acts depicted are shown from the point of view that this actually happened, as opposed to well lets give the audience some gore. People seeing the film tend to be shocked from the former point of view as opposed to the latter.The film opens deceptively with a Cheyenne massacre of a US Cavalry troop guarding a pay chest. The survivors of the massacre are one naive boy soldier and a savvy, young frontier woman, played superbly by Peter Strauss, and Candice Bergen respectively. Their adventures and subsequent romance are then chronicled. Along the way they encounter Donald Pleasance's superbly sinister arms smuggler. The film's climax is a savage massacre of a Cheyenne village by the US Army - based on the real life events at Sand Creek, Colorado. In an orgy of blood lust, women and children are slaughtered and body parts are taken as trophies. By this time the film has swung 180 degrees from its opening, and has established the root cause of the suffering which is the white man's treatment of the native american. During all this, Strauss' character has changed from naive volunteer soldier to conscientious objector while the character of Candice Bergen remains the hope of reconciliation and co-existence.The film is brutally honest and makes its point more effectively than other bigger budget films of the same genre eg. Dances With Wolves. Sadly (until the Lions Gate release)the film was not readily available in the USA. I would hope that this re release of the film on dvd, is in its completely uncut version. The film is available on both dvd and vhs here in the UK but it is the cut version. In the current climate, this re release of a brutally honest recreation of a bloody piece of American history, is timely and should be well received. I strongly urge people to see this film and form their own conclusions, however.As a footnote, should the Lions Gate release turn out to be the cut version then be aware that the film was released on dvd, in its completely uncut version in Germany, as of July 2004. The film looks absolutely fantastic on dvd, picture and sound quality are incredible for a film of this age. Having seen this version, has made me realise that the 'uncut' version I saw in the UK years ago was in fact slightly cut. Therefore, be warned, this version is very strong viewing, indeed. Any previously 'uncut' version that you saw in the past probably was in fact censored to some degree. This version of the film is titled 'Das Wiegenlied Vom Totschlag' and is available from Amazon De, which is where I got my copy from. It is a Region 2/Pal dvd, so just be aware that your dvd player may not be able to play this format. Definitely a film worth upgrading to multi region play though. Fans of the film who would prefer to see the film in an Anamorphic 16.9 picture (as opposed to full screen on the Lions Gate dvd) will be delighted to know that this particular dvd is released in the 16.9 format.Technical details as follows:- Title is Das Wiegenlied Vom Totschlag- Sound is Dolby Digital mono.- Format is 16.9 anamorphic- Area is Region 2/Pal- Extras are a theatrical trailer- Running time is 110 mins.- Languages available are English, German, Italian, and Spanish",5,How the West was really won,1163376000,"11 13, 2006",2006,3415,"['Soldier', 'Blue', 'was', 'made', 'biting', 'allegory', 'Vietnam', 'war', 'divided', 'critics', 'time', 'release', 'indeed', 'do', 'so', 'extremely', 'brutal', 'not', 'gratuitously', 'so', 'appalling', 'acts', 'depicted', 'are', 'shown', 'point', 'view', 'actually', 'happened', 'opposed', 'well', 'lets', 'give', 'audience', 'gore', 'People', 'seeing', 'film', 'tend', 'be', 'shocked', 'former', 'point', 'view', 'opposed', 'latter.The', 'film', 'deceptively', 'Cheyenne', 'massacre', 'US', 'Cavalry', 'troop', 'guarding', 'pay', 'chest', 'survivors', 'massacre', 'are', 'one', 'naive', 'boy', 'soldier', 'savvy', 'young', 'frontier', 'woman', 'played', 'superbly', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'respectively', 'adventures', 'subsequent', 'romance', 'are', 'then', 'chronicled', 'way', 'encounter', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'superbly', 'sinister', 'arms', 'smuggler', 'film', 'climax', 'savage', 'massacre', 'Cheyenne', 'village', 'US', 'Army', 'based', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'Sand', 'Creek', 'Colorado', 'orgy', 'blood', 'lust', 'women', 'children', 'are', 'slaughtered', 'body', 'parts', 'are', 'taken', 'trophies', 'time', 'film', 'swung', '180', 'degrees', 'opening', 'established', 'root', 'cause', 'suffering', 'white', 'man', 'treatment', 'native', 'american', 'Strauss', 'character', 'changed', 'naive', 'volunteer', 'soldier', 'conscientious', 'objector', 'character', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'hope', 'reconciliation', 'co-existence.The', 'film', 'brutally', 'honest', 'point', 'more', 'effectively', 'other', 'bigger', 'budget', 'films', 'same', 'genre', 'eg', 'Dances', 'Wolves', 'Sadly', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'release', 'film', 'was', 'not', 'readily', 'available', 'USA', 'would', 'hope', 're', 'release', 'film', 'dvd', 'completely', 'uncut', 'version', 'film', 'available', 'dvd', 'vhs', 'here', 'UK', 'cut', 'version', 'current', 'climate', 're', 'release', 'brutally', 'honest', 'recreation', 'bloody', 'piece', 'American', 'history', 'timely', 'should', 'be', 'well', 'received', 'strongly', 'urge', 'people', 'see', 'film', 'form', 'own', 'conclusions', 'footnote', 'should', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'release', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'cut', 'version', 'then', 'be', 'aware', 'film', 'was', 'released', 'dvd', 'completely', 'uncut', 'version', 'Germany', 'July', '2004', 'film', 'absolutely', 'fantastic', 'dvd', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'are', 'incredible', 'film', 'age', 'Having', 'seen', 'version', 'made', 'realise', ""'uncut"", 'version', 'saw', 'UK', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'fact', 'slightly', 'cut', 'Therefore', 'be', 'warned', 'version', 'very', 'strong', 'viewing', 'indeed', 'previously', ""'uncut"", 'version', 'saw', 'past', 'probably', 'was', 'fact', 'censored', 'degree', 'version', 'film', 'titled', ""'Das"", 'Wiegenlied', 'Vom', 'Totschlag', 'available', 'Amazon', 'De', 'where', 'got', 'copy', 'Region', '2/Pal', 'dvd', 'so', 'just', 'be', 'aware', 'dvd', 'player', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'able', 'play', 'format', 'Definitely', 'film', 'worth', 'upgrading', 'multi', 'region', 'play', 'Fans', 'film', 'who', 'would', 'prefer', 'see', 'film', 'Anamorphic', '16.9', 'picture', 'opposed', 'full', 'screen', 'Lions', 'Gate', 'dvd', 'will', 'be', 'delighted', 'know', 'particular', 'dvd', 'released', '16.9', 'format.Technical', 'details', 'Title', 'Das', 'Wiegenlied', 'Vom', 'Totschlag-', 'Sound', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'mono.-', 'Format', '16.9', 'anamorphic-', 'Area', 'Region', '2/Pal-', 'Extras', 'are', 'theatrical', 'trailer-', 'Running', 'time', '110', 'mins.-', 'Languages', 'available', 'are', 'English', 'German', 'Italian', 'Spanish']",N/A
196747,AOZGOFPVAUMTB,6300147363,Doug Park,"[4, 4]","Simply put, this is the best western film that I've ever seen. Despite one or two historical inaccuracies and generally phony-looking costume design, ""Soldier Blue"" captures the complexities of the American expansion westward during the 1860s in a compelling, often unsettling, but never trite or boring way. All of the characters are idiosyncratic yet highly believable: Bergen, Strauss, and, perhaps most of all, Pleasence as Isaac ""Q. Cumber"" all give unforgettable performances. ""Soldier Blue"" has been criticized for its graphic portrayal of the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864, which probably explains why it is not as widely known as other films of its period. Indeed, the reenactment of the massacre pulls no punches in showing rapes of Cheyenne women and brutal killings of young children. The way it captures the atrocity left me thinking, ""That's how it must have really been."" The whole mood of the film is strangely cartoonish at times, with a sense of humor as unique as the rest of it. Nonetheless,that only helps to make the art imitate life, as well as to avoid making ""Soldier Blue"" unpalatably grim.

196748,A1X9OJN30EBE3M,6300147363,Dr. Karl O. Edwards,"[16, 27]","August 2, 2008:  This will be my third attempt to update my review of this movie, based upon input from comments and responses to my comments on another review of ""Soldier Blue.""First off, let me state that I regret giving ""Soldier Blue"" a one star rating.  My intellectual desire for ""realism"" and ""factuality"" lead me to this regrettable  rating, and in hindsight should have rated it three or four stars.  Readers of my review have given me plenty of negative feedback to let me know that they do not appreciate my one star review, apparently because they really like the movie--as do I (as stated in my review title and closing)--and do not like the fact that I have given in only one star.  To all of you, I am sorry.Second, let me make it clear that I personally do not see this as an ""anti-Vietnam war vehicle,"" and apologize for not making that clear.  At the time ""Soldier Blue"" was released it was viewed and reviewed by the director, many critics, and others as such.  Hence, I started my original review by stating:This anti-Vietnam war vehicle is fiction with tidbits of reality, wrapped in the disguise of a ""love story"" and the opening statement that it is based on ""true events.""From the above opening sentence, I continued on with the following revised comments.  I first saw the ""R-rated"" movie when it came out and I was totally awestruck by what I believed to be a realistic visual representation of true events.  Despite having read hundreds of books on Native Americans--including the Cheyenne--I had never heard of the Sand Creek (Colorado) Massacre.  I left the theater thinking, ""yes, they have finally made a movie portraying what really happened.""  But then I started reading the news/entertainment articles and reviews about how the movie was really a story about the My Lai massacre.  Being a supporter of our military and their efforts in Vietnam, yet angry at the military for scapegoating Second Lieutenant William Calley, I became even angrier that people were trying to ignore the ""truth"" of the movie.Again, let me clarify my comments.  When ""Soldier Blue"" was released, I was conservative youth preparing to enter the military ranks and believed (at that time; I have since changed that belief) that our countries involvement in Viet Nam was the right thing.  However, I was--like most Americans--shocked and angered by My Lai.  But, I was equally angry at the military for placing all the blame on just one person, Second Lieutenant William Calley.  Hence, when I saw ""news reports"" that ""Soldier Blue"" was just an anti-Vietnam movie, ""I became even angrier that people were trying to ignore the ""truth"" of the movie.""  Unfortunately, I did not make the focus of my anger clear in this statement.  I did not become more angry about ""Soldier Blue"" being an anti-Vietnam movie, but rather I became more angry because I thought (and saw) that people were ignoring the ""truth"" about how the Cheyenne and other Native American peoples were really treated; that, to quote a subsequently ""popular"" review, ""we're not as benevolent as we'd like to think.""  My anger was about other viewers missing the point portrayed in ""Soldier Blue"" that America was ""settled"" (aka, stolen) at a violent and deadly cost to the Native Americans who were living here way before America was even ""known"" about in Europe.  Again, I agree with Timothy P. Scanlon when he states in his review, that ""Soldier Blue"" is ""a view of how we really ""moved West,"" and why the US is challenged as a purveyor of ""democracy.""  Or, as I put it above: ""yes, they have finally made a movie portraying what really happened.""A few months after viewing the movie, as a freshman in college, I was able to conduct extensive research at the University of Utah library on the Sand Creek Massacre (also known as the Chivington massacre or the ""Battle of Sand Creek""), which took place, as stated in the voice over at the end of the movie, on November 29, 1864.  I gained access to rare documents and government documents, including Congressional and military hearings and investigations.  I learned many important things that helped me better understand Hollywood's ""Soldier Blue"" and the reality of the Sand Creek Massacre.  Most important for me was the fact that, unlike the events prior to the massacre depicted in the movie, the real Sand Creek Massacre was well planned, deliberately executed, and NOT PROVOKED by the ""enemy""/Cheyennes. Equally sad, the Sand Creek Massacre was considered at the time to be a major victory--and is still listed as one of the greatest victories of the Civil War at a memorial installed at the Colorado Capitol in Denver.  [Hopefully, this edited paragraph has made my views clearer now].""Soldier Blue"" does an amazing job of describing the truth of how many ""westerners"" treated Native Nations when Candice Bergen's character asks Peter Strauss' character: (1) about who really started scalping (Europeans did, as a replacement to taking heads); (2) if Strauss' character had not seen tobacco pouches made from Native American Women's breasts (a common practice among whites in the west, especially by civilians; and, (3) if Strauss' character had seen whites dismember Native Americans (although the running wild with body parts on the ""long knives"" occurred, to the best of my knowledge, only at the Sand Creek massacre).  Furthermore, Black Kettle (the real ""chief"" at Sand Creek) did ride out with an American Flag and a flag of truce in an attempt to tell the soldiers that they were peaceful; and, more importantly were encamped precisely where the government and military had ordered them to encamp.  Interestingly, there actually may have been non-Native Americans living with the Cheyenne; George Bent, the son of the American William Bent and a Cheyenne mother, was at Black Kettle's village when Chivington's (the real commander of the Colorado Regiment) soldiers struck the Cheyenne encampment at Sand Creek, Colorado.  [Hopefully, this is clearer now].Little else in ""Soldier Blue"" is very accurate.  For example, Black Kettle, unlike the fictitious Spotted Wolf, was a long standing Cheyenne leader that championed the cause of remaining peaceful with the whites--as were all the Cheyennes and Arapahos at Sand Creek.  I doubt very many of the Cheyennes were played by actual Native Americans.  The costumes, tepees, and other props are all completely non-Native American; and definitely not Cheyenne.  During the scenes of the massacre they show soldiers cutting off a women's breast, which was done to over half the women (eventually) killed, but it could not show the soldiers (and civilians who were also involved) cutting out women's vaginae (frequently used for saddle horn decorations), cutting off men's penises and testicles, or playing catch with babies. [I hope my revisions in this paragraph help readers to better understand what I was trying to tell about the sad reality of Sand Creek.]So why do I love this movie?  Because Candace Bergen's performance is witty, charming, and so realistic.  Because it is a film that is fun to watch.  Because it does arouse outrage at how Native Americans--and, I might add, especially Cheyennes--were treated.  And, because Buffy Sainte-Marie (a Cree Indian) contributed songs to the soundtrack.  [I have left this paragraph unchanged.]Update--1 July 2008: If this review was not helpful to you, I would appreciate learning the reason(s) so I can improve my reviews.  My goal is to provide help to potential buyers, not get into any arguments.

196749,A2D8CUJPOSRPNA,6300147363,Erik North,"[167, 175]","NOTE: This review of SOLDIER BLUE applies to the uncut version released by Lionsgate in 2006 and not the 'PG' version that had been on video for years.Released in the late summer of 1970, SOLDIER BLUE concerns itself with a disenfranchised U.S. cavalry officer (Peter Strauss), one of only two survivors of a savage attack on an Army payroll train by Cheyenne Indians in Colorado, who falls in love with the other survivor, a white woman (Candace Bergen) who had been raised by the Cheyenne.  Although cut off from his unit, Strauss refuses to believe that the U.S. Army is acting with undue harshness towards the Indians, until his experiences with Bergen show him otherwise.  Making their way across hostile territory, and for a moment in the clutches of a deranged gun runner (Donald Pleasance), they reach an Army fort where they learn of a plan by a vengeance-minded general (John Anderson) to destroy the Cheyenne.Bergen and Strauss warn the Cheyenne villagers of this possibility.  When Anderson's troop appears on the outskirts of the village, the Indians raise an American flag as if in supplication.  Anderson, however, is unmoved; and all Bergen and Strauss can do is watch as the Cheyenne and their village are totally annihilated.SOLDIER BLUE, directed by Ralph Nelson (CHARLY, LILIES OF THE FIELD), is unique because it was the first western of its kind to really paint the Army as inherently evil.  Given that it was based on the infamous 1864 Sand Creek massacre and that it equated mistreatment of the Cheyenne with the revelations of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam at the time of its release, this is not surprising--though contrary to what some might say, it is also not politically (let alone realistically) correct.Until Lionsgate, the studio responsible for FAHRENHEIT 9/11, restored the and re-released the film on DVD last year, however SOLDIER BLUE could only be seen in a severely cut form, allowing for the 'PG' rating it had for so long.  In reality, in its original form here, it was considerably notorious because of its extreme violence, particularly the horrific final massacre.  As such, it exceeded even the levels of violence in THE WILD BUNCH and would almost certainly challenge the opening of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for sheer war-related carnage.  It nearly got an 'X' rating, but came away with an 'R'.  It was then edited for re-release down to a 'PG', with much of the violence cut.That said, however, Bergen and Strauss, who were practically unknown at the time, deliver fairly good performances; and the on-location shooting in central Mexico is breathtakingly panoramic when it's not focusing in on the violence angle.  Roy Budd's score is also appropriate, with noted folk singer Buffy Sainte-Marie (a Cree Indian) contributing songs to the soundtrack.Now that it is in its uncut form, it is up for the viewer to judge the merits of this, the FAHRENHEIT 9/11 of the Western genre.  It still isn't an easy film to like, and almost certainly there will be those that loathe it not only for its violence but also its admittedly hyperbolic view of the Army.  Nevertheless, it can and should be seen now in its original form so that people can come to terms with its painful message about our genocidal mistreatment of the Native American.",4,"Good As It Is, And Now It's UNCUT!",995414400,"07 18, 2001",2001,3276,"['NOTE', 'review', 'SOLDIER', 'BLUE', 'uncut', 'version', 'released', 'Lionsgate', '2006', 'not', ""'PG"", 'version', 'had', 'been', 'video', 'years.Released', 'late', 'summer', '1970', 'SOLDIER', 'BLUE', 'disenfranchised', 'U.S.', 'cavalry', 'officer', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'one', 'only', 'two', 'survivors', 'savage', 'attack', 'Army', 'payroll', 'train', 'Cheyenne', 'Indians', 'Colorado', 'who', 'love', 'other', 'survivor', 'white', 'woman', 'Candace', 'Bergen', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'raised', 'Cheyenne', 'cut', 'off', 'unit', 'Strauss', 'believe', 'U.S.', 'Army', 'acting', 'undue', 'harshness', 'Indians', 'experiences', 'Bergen', 'show', 'otherwise', 'Making', 'way', 'hostile', 'territory', 'moment', 'clutches', 'deranged', 'gun', 'runner', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'reach', 'Army', 'fort', 'where', 'learn', 'plan', 'vengeance-minded', 'general', 'John', 'Anderson', 'destroy', 'Cheyenne.Bergen', 'Strauss', 'warn', 'Cheyenne', 'villagers', 'possibility', 'When', 'Anderson', 'troop', 'outskirts', 'village', 'Indians', 'raise', 'American', 'flag', 'supplication', 'Anderson', 'however', 'unmoved', 'Bergen', 'Strauss', 'can', 'do', 'watch', 'Cheyenne', 'village', 'are', 'totally', 'annihilated.SOLDIER', 'BLUE', 'directed', 'Ralph', 'Nelson', 'CHARLY', 'LILIES', 'THE', 'FIELD', 'unique', 'was', 'first', 'western', 'kind', 'really', 'paint', 'Army', 'inherently', 'evil', 'Given', 'was', 'based', 'infamous', '1864', 'Sand', 'Creek', 'massacre', 'equated', 'mistreatment', 'Cheyenne', 'revelations', 'My', 'Lai', 'massacre', 'Vietnam', 'time', 'release', 'not', 'surprising', 'contrary', 'what', 'might', 'say', 'also', 'not', 'politically', 'let', 'alone', 'realistically', 'correct.Until', 'Lionsgate', 'studio', 'responsible', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'restored', 're-released', 'film', 'DVD', 'last', 'year', 'however', 'SOLDIER', 'BLUE', 'could', 'only', 'be', 'seen', 'severely', 'cut', 'form', 'allowing', ""'PG"", 'rating', 'had', 'so', 'long', 'reality', 'original', 'form', 'here', 'was', 'considerably', 'notorious', 'extreme', 'violence', 'particularly', 'horrific', 'final', 'massacre', 'such', 'exceeded', 'even', 'levels', 'violence', 'THE', 'WILD', 'BUNCH', 'would', 'almost', 'certainly', 'challenge', 'opening', 'SAVING', 'PRIVATE', 'RYAN', 'sheer', 'war-related', 'carnage', 'nearly', 'got', 'X', 'rating', 'came', 'away', 'R', 'was', 'then', 'edited', 're-release', 'down', ""'PG"", 'much', 'violence', 'cut.That', 'said', 'however', 'Bergen', 'Strauss', 'who', 'were', 'practically', 'unknown', 'time', 'deliver', 'fairly', 'good', 'performances', 'on-location', 'shooting', 'central', 'Mexico', 'breathtakingly', 'panoramic', 'when', 'not', 'focusing', 'violence', 'angle', 'Roy', 'Budd', 'score', 'also', 'appropriate', 'noted', 'folk', 'singer', 'Buffy', 'Sainte-Marie', 'Cree', 'Indian', 'contributing', 'songs', 'soundtrack.Now', 'uncut', 'form', 'up', 'viewer', 'judge', 'merits', 'FAHRENHEIT', '9/11', 'Western', 'genre', 'still', ""n't"", 'easy', 'film', 'like', 'almost', 'certainly', 'will', 'be', 'loathe', 'not', 'only', 'violence', 'also', 'admittedly', 'hyperbolic', 'view', 'Army', 'Nevertheless', 'can', 'should', 'be', 'seen', 'now', 'original', 'form', 'people', 'can', 'come', 'terms', 'painful', 'message', 'genocidal', 'mistreatment', 'Native', 'American']",N/A

One assumes he is called Soldier Blue because of his uniform and not his amorous encounter with the lovely Candice Bergen, which is sadly chaste. There's so much ketchup flying around shouldn't it have been called Soldier Red? If General Custard had turned up they could have called it Soldier Yellow. Yes, he was called Custard, I remember from Primary school. Nowadays, kids don't get taught any history in school so this film is vital, VITAL I tell you! It tells you the fact that although Indians were massacred, the film industry had also discovered that young people watch movies the most. Who would have thought it? So let's suck up to them as much as possible and poke fun at authority. Actually, the first 40 minutes of sparring between the two winning leads is the most enjoyable I've watched in a movie for quite a while. Unfortunately, they don't then cut to the chase. For some reason though, this film does hold together and works quite well when it really shouldn't.

How is possible that Chief Spotted Wolf lead a destructive raid against the paymaster's custody and then plead he is ""peaceful and friendly"" to white people?Now to the film's story. A small detachment guarding the paymaster wagon and a white woman escaped from the Cheyenne is exterminated by a Cheyenne war party.The only survivors are Cresta Lee and Pvt. Honus Gent who will try to reach a military outpost thru wild country. Pending their odyssey Honus and Cresta will confront, get acknowledged to each other and finally fall in love.When they finally meet the army, Col. Iverson is in the eve of launching an assault on the unaware native village. Cresta get word to the village of the impeding attack. Nevertheless tragedy is unstoppable.Candice Bergen is outstanding as the foul-mouthed experienced frontier woman, convincing and natural in her role. Peter Strauss who is at the very beginning of his actor career shows a believable and shrewd characterization of the green, almost nave soldier.Director Ralph Nelson delivers a shocking, hard and in some way testimonial film at par with his best films as ""Lilies of the Fields"" (1963) and ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" (1962).Roy Budd responsible of the music score and Robert B. Hauser as director of photography greatly contribute to enhance the movie.Finally I give a personal reflection on the movie. It was a precursor film to expose the dark side of ""civilizing"" the west and the unjust treatment given to Native Americans.

The characterizations actually reverse the expectations of the helpless lady from the East (Bergen's ""Chresta Marybelle Lee"" is from New York City but she is no ""lady"") and the trail-wise cavalryman (Strauss, also in a very fine performance, is naive, rather prissy and only accidentally adequate as a frontiersman) in that it is Bergen who understands the environment, evinces the most courage and Western savvy, and who is the most powerful voice of sanity and humane conscience -- despite her seeming ""utilitarian"" philosophy.The final section of the film is of course the most controversial but it is really (especially in the edited version) only a truncated look at the historical atrocity of the Sand Creek Massacre (only one among many by the way, and unfortunately not unusual), upon which it is based. With its contemporary, Arthur Penn's more artistically accomplished ""Little Big Man,"" ""Soldier Blue"" has attempted to show what the conventional celebrations of American military conquest rarely reveal, namely its base in racism, crude jingoism and gross brutality. The final scene of the braver-and-wiser (now ""radicalized"") ""Honus Gant"" (Strauss), chained behind a cargo wagon as a ""traitor"" (a charge with which he had formerly accused ""Chresta""), while a deerskin-clothed Bergen, now moving off with the remnant of Cheyenne survivors, beams at him through tear-streaming eyes is reminiscent of the moving last meeting between Kirk Douglas as ""Spartacus,"" crucified at a Roman gate, and Jean Simmons as his wife ""Varinia,"" defiantly revealing to him their baby son who will now live in freedom in that 1960 epic.This movie, most will say I think, could have been better; yet it is, despite so many flaws, a true ""minor masterpiece"": it has something worthwhile to say and says it so that you will always remember. The lead actors (Donald Pleasence is also -- as always -- remarkable as a ""prairie scum"" worthy of the legendary Strother Martin and L. Q.

When a local station was brave enough to air it--uncensored, no less--years ago, I was stunned at the depiction not only of sadistic violence, but overt racism and genocide that most westerns have chosen to whitewash or ignore to avoid offending mainstream audiences.  That said, it's not easy to watch &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; without recoiling at the visciousness of so-called civilized people who defended their actions by labelling everyone else &quot;savages.&quot;  Peter Strauss plays a wayward cavalry soldier who teams up with a frontier-savvy immigrant (Candice Bergen) on the eve of a brutal attack by the army (based loosely on Chivington's massacre of the Cheyenne at Sand Creek)  He quickly comes to realize who the real savages are but is nonetheless powerless to prevent the gleeful slaughter that includes rape and dismemberment.  &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; may remind viewers of &quot;Little Big Man&quot; and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;--and there are striking similarities--but despite their higher production values, neither film seems to capture the sheer venom of actions and attitudes against Native Americans.  (The film itself stops short of depicting the full range of brutality.)

Another reviewer referred to it as an ""anti-Vietnam War"" film. It was that only in that it was timely, i.e., while we heard that the great US forces were freeing the Vietnamese peasants from commie tyranny, we were actually slaughtering them.The story is based on a novel. That, in fact, is why I can only give it four stars. It's about the Sand Creek massacre, one of many slaughters of the red man, that occured in the 1860s.

196769,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6300147363,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Take away the once-shocking finale and Soldier Blue isn't much of a movie. Much of it is a simple reversal of Western clich&eacute;s, as Peter Strauss' unconvincingly nave cavalryman is saved by Candice Bergen's tough-talking former Cheyenne white hostage after a massacre. While it's understandable that at the time the producers would need to play relatively safe for most of the running time to avoid alienating an audience reared on more traditional western fare, the big problem is that we never really get much of a sense of the Cheyenne culture, with the tribe introduced far too late in the film to provide any real emotional outrage as the film takes a sudden left turn into Mai-Lai allegory complete with shockingly bad makeup effects.If the action cues in Roy Budd's score sound familiar, that's because he famously the gig by playing several cues from Jerry Fielding's The Wild Bunch that he passed off on the unsuspecting producer as his own, though the rest of the score is a much more 70s concoction. And in the familiarity stakes it's truly weird to hear David de Keyser and Robert Rietty redubbing the Cheyenne dialogue!Lionsgate's DVD is the uncut 2.35:1 widescreen version.",3,Surprisingly conventional despite the controversy,1170460800,"02 3, 2007",2007,1192,"['Take', 'away', 'once-shocking', 'finale', 'Soldier', 'Blue', ""n't"", 'much', 'movie', 'Much', 'simple', 'reversal', 'Western', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Peter', 'Strauss', 'unconvincingly', 'nave', 'cavalryman', 'saved', 'Candice', 'Bergen', 'tough-talking', 'former', 'Cheyenne', 'white', 'hostage', 'massacre', 'understandable', 'time', 'producers', 'would', 'need', 'play', 'relatively', 'safe', 'most', 'running', 'time', 'avoid', 'alienating', 'audience', 'reared', 'more', 'traditional', 'western', 'fare', 'big', 'problem', 'never', 'really', 'get', 'much', 'sense', 'Cheyenne', 'culture', 'tribe', 'introduced', 'far', 'too', 'late', 'film', 'provide', 'real', 'emotional', 'outrage', 'film', 'sudden', 'left', 'turn', 'Mai-Lai', 'allegory', 'complete', 'shockingly', 'bad', 'makeup', 'action', 'cues', 'Roy', 'Budd', 'score', 'sound', 'familiar', 'famously', 'gig', 'playing', 'several', 'cues', 'Jerry', 'Fielding', 'Wild', 'Bunch', 'passed', 'off', 'unsuspecting', 'producer', 'own', 'rest', 'score', 'much', 'more', '70s', 'concoction', 'familiarity', 'truly', 'weird', 'hear', 'David', 'de', 'Keyser', 'Robert', 'Rietty', 'redubbing', 'Cheyenne', 'dialogue', 'Lionsgate', 'DVD', 'uncut', '2.35:1', 'widescreen', 'version']",N/A
