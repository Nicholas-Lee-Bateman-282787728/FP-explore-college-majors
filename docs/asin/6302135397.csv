When she refuses, torture ensues. The torture is more suggested than shown but it is still very frightening. What makes it even worse is that we know the main character is entirely innocent of the charges. Although Rickman often plays the villain in movies, he doesn't have a ""stock villain"", he makes each one of his roles into a fully realized and entirely different character. He really has an amazing talent. Madeleine Stowe capitalizes on her ability to play characters that are vulnerable yet possessed of a great inner strength. They both give wonderful performances in this disturbing film.Before the Abu-Ghraib scandal, I would have watched this film thinking ""I'm glad my country doesn't do things like that."" But now, unfortunately I cannot make that statement. Although the perpetrators of Abu-Ghraib are being prosecuted in a court of law, who knows what torture goes on that remains unreported and unpunished? Although we Westerners like to think that torture is a problem only in countries where communism and despots rule, truth be told, torture is not unknown in democracies.

297288,A79Q8J5DAG55N,6302135397,kyle porter,"[2, 2]","The most depressing and disturbing thing about the film Closetland, is that it was completely beaten down and condemned by published critics throughout the U.S.  The truth of the matter is that this film is one of  the best I have ever seen and will continue to be, even through all of the  disregard and wrong it has been given.  The film is disturbing, but it is  intended to be that way.  In my opinion it serves the purpose that Crash,  Natural Born Killers, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Lost Highway were  all intended to do: to produce startling imagery that would stimulate your  emotions and the deepest areas in your thinking, so that you might come to  question yourself from what you see and interpret.  In ways  Closetland  like these other films are mirror in a carnival house, presenting a  distorted reality which suggests anothing aspect to reality you could not  possibly imagine.  In time, you begin to relate and analyze so much of this  surrealism that you expand into three dimensional thinking.  There is depth  to things in your life now, motives and incentives tangible in your  everyday existence.  You come to understand things in a new way because of  all the experiences in different dimensions of the same world.  You soon  become a new person, dare I say, a better person.  You have to understand  that in releasing your inhibitions towards films, you take a step to  accepting the world as it is, but becoming willing and able of discovering  what can't be seen on the surface.  People will say that a film is too  disturbing or too farfetched, but in truth, they are passages to other  perspectives of reality.  professional critics base their judgements on  whether the film is important, but the thing is, all films are important,  and to discredit a film is to disallow a person's expanding consciousness.  Of course some have good things to say, but we take their opinions for our  own too much, so in a way, the condemnation of films is our fault.  What  should be said for Closetland in particular is that this film is  thought-provoking (excuse this cliche) and powerful, with acting that I  would say is ideal and satisfying. Production design, writing, art  direction, score, photography and editing, these elements come to me as so  well done, I am mystified as to how this film lacks the qualities of  sigificance or outstanding craftsmanship.  This is also a film that does  not require a strong plot, because its not a film that relies on its  structure to bring it along into completion and storyline strength, it  relies on the superb characters and down-to-earth functions of reality.  Twists do not make this film, the reality of its situation and characters  do.  Lastly, yes this film is not for the young, because veiwing it is like  drinking alcohol, you must be old enough and at a biological stage to  handle its effects.  But it should be seen, by everyone if at all possible,  because Amnesty International endorsed it for a reason: its a true story  that happens every single day.  If you ever see an unsettling film, let  this be the one, because its sheer power is enough to humble your core  confidence in the state of our world.

But the whole issue of childhood sexual abuse--upon which the movie seems to turn, since it is hinted at early on and seems to be at the core of what the prisoner is refusing to tell--is weirdly at odds with the supposed political message. It's as if, on the one hand, the story is just using this mysterious torture as a means of getting her to confess that she was abused as a child. On the other hand, the abuse seems like a something that's been introduced at random--but with mysterious importance--into this story about political torture. It's as if the movie doesn't know what it wants to be about. Or as if it's trying to equate childhood abuse with political torture--and that may be the case, given some of the things the prisoner says in her final speech--which is a connection that just didn't click for me. The only reason I am rating this film as high as I am is due to Alan Rickman's amazing performance as the interrogator. But I honestly can't recommend this film just on the basis of that performance. It seems more like a catalog of torture methods than a story.

But be prepared for a very unpleasant movie.This is the story of a children's author that is brought in for ""questioning"" by a nameless government. The whole film takes place in one room where she is questioned (tortured) by a government official (Rickman). The story quickly becomes psychological warfare between the two characters as the ""victim"" is not as easily broken as the government inquisitor first thought. By the end of the movie the balance of power has shifted and it's the inquisitor who may break under his own sadism.The violence in the movie is not horror movie graphic but it is far more brutal in its realistic potrayal. The actual acts are cut-aways that you don't see(mostly) but the suggestion of the acts make you squirm.I did find the strange sub-plot of their relationship revealed at the end to be out of place. I didn't think it necessary to the stark experimental plot. But that's just my opinion.
