1029016,A3NZZZ8H3BP3ZN,B000JMKKI6,"A. Horn ""neat freak""","[16, 16]",We watched this movie on a Direct TV channel (surprise) and loved it!  My four-year old daughter watched the whole 30 minutes without flinching and that says a lot.  It's explained so simply and with such wonderful animation that even I was drawn to watch it and I never tired of it either.  This is definitely a must-have for your Christmas collection.  Thanks to Exclaim Entertainment for a refreshing and long overdue nativity story for everyone!,5,It's About Time!,1164326400,"11 24, 2006",2006,449,"['watched', 'movie', 'Direct', 'TV', 'channel', 'surprise', 'loved', 'four-year', 'old', 'daughter', 'watched', 'whole', '30', 'minutes', 'flinching', 'lot', 'explained', 'so', 'simply', 'such', 'wonderful', 'animation', 'even', 'was', 'drawn', 'watch', 'never', 'tired', 'definitely', 'must-have', 'Christmas', 'collection', 'Thanks', 'Exclaim', 'Entertainment', 'refreshing', 'long', 'overdue', 'nativity', 'story', 'everyone']",The Very First Noel

I'm amazed at how concise and short they could make it wihout short changing the story. I don't know how they managed to do it, but they were able to incorporate and accurately capture all the essential elements of the story in such an enchanting, poetic, and charming dialogue. The voice casting was excellent too!There are also stunning effects, animation, and music. I extremely enjoyed all the Christmas carols and lines of Christmas songs incorporated into the dialogue as well.I give a resounding AMEN and KUDOS to the makers of this DVD and I agree with all these other reviews. This is heartwarming, touching, and beautiful! It reaches down deep. It's perfectly seamless and well executed. I am so impressed!Whether you have children or not, this is a must have delight! Don't overlook this one.

Such a wonderful retelling of the true Christmas story.  Contains lots of great detail & yet keeps a toddler's attention!  Definitely something he can grow into as well over the years.
