I know that ENO released a VHS tape but it was long deleted and now I know why.To say I am disappointed is an understatement!The DVD opens with an interesting introduction from Jonathan Miller on the rational behind the production but as soon as you hear the first chords from the orchestra you know this is a truly awful DVD transfer.The picture is OK most of the time (though there are too many hand held close ups for my taste and these have a 'shaky' quality about them) but where the DVD really falls down is the audio recording. It says it is in Dolby Digital Stereo but since it was produced in the 1970s by Thames Television this must be a processed version of the original mono recording - I can only assume they must have used a bit rate of about 4 because the quality is truly the worst I have ever heard on any DVD (and I have had some pretty bad ones in the past).To give you an idea of how terrible it is I can only assume it was recorded by somebody in the back row of the stalls with a 'cheap' 1970s cassette player using the built in microphone and auto noise levelling.If you had one of these devices you will know precisely what I mean ... the sound is tinny in the extreme, there is absolutely no depth to the orchestral sound or the voices and there appears to be some sort of post production processing going on which almost turns off the orchestra when the singers are singing and then blasts out when they take a breath - the effect is truly hideous and makes the recording almost unbearable to listen to.For me this DVD provides a fond reminiscence of the sets and staging but I think I would rather view it with the subtitles and the sound muted.If you want to get a better impression of the original production check out the Channel 4 programme Operatunity (available on the UK Amazon site). The series was a competition for would be opera singers and the final part consists of large extracts of the revival of this production with the two finalists taking the role of Gilda in shifts. The sound quality is very good and you can see the sets. OK it is not the whole opera but it is an infinitely better introduction to what was a brilliantly inventive production.UPDATE JUNE 2007 ....I contacted the publisher, Kultur, and asked them what was wrong. They had a bad master tape and tried to obtain a better copy from the original production company. Unfortunately the new copy was just as bad. Kultur replaced my DVD with an alternative from their catalogue.As far as I know this title has now been deleted from the Kultur catalogue.All customers should be warned that this would not be worth $0.01 with free postage.",1,Fantastic production ruined by a truly horrible DVD transfer,1175126400,"03 29, 2007",2007,2797,"['saw', 'production', 'live', 'ENO', '70s', 'years', 'wanted', 'get', 'copy', 'VHS', 'DVD', 'so', 'was', 'very', 'pleased', 'see', 'appear', 'get', 'copy', 'know', 'ENO', 'released', 'VHS', 'tape', 'was', 'long', 'deleted', 'now', 'know', 'why.To', 'say', 'am', 'disappointed', 'understatement', 'DVD', 'interesting', 'introduction', 'Jonathan', 'Miller', 'rational', 'production', 'as', 'soon', 'hear', 'first', 'chords', 'orchestra', 'know', 'truly', 'awful', 'DVD', 'transfer.The', 'picture', 'OK', 'most', 'time', 'are', 'too', 'many', 'hand', 'held', 'close', 'ups', 'taste', 'have', ""'shaky"", 'quality', 'where', 'DVD', 'really', 'down', 'audio', 'recording', 'Dolby', 'Digital', 'Stereo', 'was', 'produced', '1970s', 'Thames', 'Television', 'must', 'be', 'processed', 'version', 'original', 'mono', 'recording', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'must', 'have', 'used', 'bit', 'rate', '4', 'quality', 'truly', 'worst', 'have', 'ever', 'heard', 'DVD', 'have', 'had', 'pretty', 'bad', 'ones', 'past', '.To', 'give', 'idea', 'how', 'terrible', 'can', 'only', 'assume', 'was', 'recorded', 'somebody', 'back', 'row', 'stalls', ""'cheap"", '1970s', 'cassette', 'player', 'using', 'built', 'microphone', 'auto', 'noise', 'levelling.If', 'had', 'one', 'devices', 'will', 'know', 'precisely', 'what', 'mean', 'sound', 'tinny', 'extreme', 'absolutely', 'depth', 'orchestral', 'sound', 'voices', 'be', 'sort', 'post', 'production', 'processing', 'going', 'almost', 'off', 'orchestra', 'when', 'singers', 'are', 'singing', 'then', 'out', 'when', 'take', 'breath', 'effect', 'truly', 'hideous', 'recording', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'listen', 'to.For', 'DVD', 'fond', 'reminiscence', 'sets', 'staging', 'think', 'would', 'rather', 'view', 'subtitles', 'sound', 'muted.If', 'want', 'get', 'better', 'impression', 'original', 'production', 'check', 'Channel', '4', 'programme', 'Operatunity', 'available', 'UK', 'Amazon', 'site', 'series', 'was', 'competition', 'would', 'be', 'opera', 'singers', 'final', 'part', 'large', 'extracts', 'revival', 'production', 'two', 'finalists', 'taking', 'role', 'Gilda', 'shifts', 'sound', 'quality', 'very', 'good', 'can', 'see', 'sets', 'not', 'whole', 'opera', 'infinitely', 'better', 'introduction', 'what', 'was', 'brilliantly', 'inventive', 'production.UPDATE', 'JUNE', '2007', '.I', 'contacted', 'publisher', 'Kultur', 'asked', 'what', 'was', 'wrong', 'had', 'bad', 'master', 'tape', 'tried', 'obtain', 'better', 'copy', 'original', 'production', 'company', 'Unfortunately', 'new', 'copy', 'was', 'just', 'bad', 'Kultur', 'replaced', 'DVD', 'alternative', 'catalogue.As', 'far', 'know', 'title', 'now', 'been', 'deleted', 'Kultur', 'catalogue.All', 'customers', 'should', 'be', 'warned', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'worth', '0.01', 'free', 'postage']",N/A
1039736,AUEYE7V7RYBD6,B000LP6KU8,Anthony Clarke,"[10, 11]","This production, by director Elijah Moshinsky for English National Opera, cries out for issue on DVD. It is, quite simply, the best updating and most relevant story-telling one can ever envisage this opera receiving. The entire opera is reset in Mafia-ridden Little Italy in New York, and the consistency and truthfulness to the original intent of the opera is astonishing. This is no updating for updating's sake. It is the work of a master director totally attuned to Verdi's drama. I've played this video often to my children, from about the age of 10 and up, and it is just a riveting introduction to great music and drama. The video is wearing out though -- SO PLEASE, NOW REMASTER FOR DVD! Joseph Losey's feature film presentation of Don Giovanni is also crying out for issue on DVD -- filmed treatment of operas at this quality are rare.",5,MASTERPIECE !,974764800,"11 21, 2000",2000,844,"['production', 'director', 'Elijah', 'Moshinsky', 'English', 'National', 'Opera', 'out', 'issue', 'DVD', 'quite', 'simply', 'best', 'updating', 'most', 'relevant', 'story-telling', 'one', 'can', 'ever', 'envisage', 'opera', 'receiving', 'entire', 'opera', 'reset', 'Mafia-ridden', 'Little', 'Italy', 'New', 'York', 'consistency', 'truthfulness', 'original', 'intent', 'opera', 'astonishing', 'updating', 'updating', 'sake', 'work', 'master', 'director', 'totally', 'attuned', 'Verdi', 'drama', ""'ve"", 'played', 'video', 'often', 'children', 'age', '10', 'up', 'just', 'riveting', 'introduction', 'great', 'music', 'drama', 'video', 'wearing', 'out', 'though', 'SO', 'PLEASE', 'NOW', 'REMASTER', 'FOR', 'DVD', 'Joseph', 'Losey', 'feature', 'film', 'presentation', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'also', 'crying', 'out', 'issue', 'DVD', 'filmed', 'treatment', 'operas', 'quality', 'are', 'rare']",N/A
1039737,A2PXQGYYWWMIBD,B000LP6KU8,C. Harbison,"[2, 2]","As the other two reviewers of this new DVD issue have said this is a truly awful DVD in terms of sound and picture quality.  The orchestra and voices are constantly shifting in volume and clarity; the picture has waves running down it much of the time and changes hue and texture constantly.  Toward the end (if you make it that far) the picture and sound quality do seem to improve or become steadier.  Quite a shame since the production is interesting and convincing.  The singing as recorded is sometimes too loud and forced, the clapping can be overbearing, but Miller has thought through his idea of a Little Italy Rigoletto with ingenuity and power.",1,Terrible sound and poor picture quality,1176422400,"04 13, 2007",2007,655,"['other', 'two', 'reviewers', 'new', 'DVD', 'issue', 'have', 'said', 'truly', 'awful', 'DVD', 'terms', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'orchestra', 'voices', 'are', 'constantly', 'shifting', 'volume', 'clarity', 'picture', 'waves', 'running', 'much', 'time', 'changes', 'hue', 'texture', 'constantly', 'end', 'make', 'far', 'picture', 'sound', 'quality', 'do', 'seem', 'improve', 'become', 'steadier', 'shame', 'production', 'interesting', 'convincing', 'singing', 'recorded', 'sometimes', 'too', 'loud', 'forced', 'clapping', 'can', 'be', 'overbearing', 'Miller', 'thought', 'idea', 'Little', 'Italy', 'Rigoletto', 'ingenuity', 'power']",N/A
1039738,AIM1A1HIA6TAD,B000LP6KU8,Col William Russell,"[1, 1]","This is an updated version of a standard opera that's actually watchable and enjoyable. Unlike more recent products, the updatings don't violate the libretto or detract from the work. The English translation is quite good and singable. The cast are good actors and excellent singers. Ok, some of the hand-held camera work is annoying but the same thing goes on in theatrical films today. Hopefully, the trend will soon stop being fashionable since it's now old hat. Some one-stars cite bad sound or poor picture. I'd say the problem lies with their equipment, not the DVD. The sound could have used more microphones and better balance with the orchestra but that doesn't make it ""bad"". This is also not a modern digital, multi-channel filming but was made 30 yrs ago and allowances have to be made.

1039739,A1ISOA9S3QN9LQ,B000LP6KU8,J. Camhi,"[3, 3]","I was very hesitant to buy this DVD after reading the negative reviews about the sound quality, but the concept seemed so interesting, I bought the DVD anyway, and I'm glad I did. I'm no expert on opera or music, but I think the sound is fine and the picture is very good.  The sound was a bit low for me, so I used boost on the DVD player software. There are a few minor imperfections and the sound may not be as crystal clear as a modern digital recording, but this was taped in 1982 or 83, and I didn't have a problem with the sound. Since people gave the VHS such good reviews, I rented the VHS at a rental store near me, which has almost every VHS tape ever made, to compare it with the DVD. In my opinion, the DVD is better than the original VHS tape because they removed the hissing that was on the VHS.  That is probably why the volume of the DVD is a bit lower than the volume of the VHS tape.  The music and singing are beautiful, the acting is excellent, and the production is brilliant.",5,Brilliant Production.
