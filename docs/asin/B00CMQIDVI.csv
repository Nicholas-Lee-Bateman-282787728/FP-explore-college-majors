I believe it concerned two investigators or detectives.  The thing that made the show interesting was the it showcased the then new sport of skydiving.  We had never seen anything like this before and I remember watching it breathlessly.Another thing that was interesting was that it co-starred Ken Curtis, Gunsmoke's Festus Haggen.  After watching him in Gunsmoke, his father-in-law John  Ford's westerns (including the classic The Searchers,) John Wayne's The Alamo, etc., it was nice to watch him in a totally modern role and it will be fun to see him again.  The other star of the series, Larry Pennell, became a character actor on tv and appeared in tons of tv series.Obviously, I haven't seen this series in about 50 years (although I still have the Dell comic book,) and I am greatly looking forward to seeing it again.",5,Another Surprising Release,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",2013,967,"['remember', 'watching', 'show', 'father', 'was', 'syndicated', 'series', 'believe', 'ran', 'Thursday', 'evenings', '7PM', 'New', 'York', 'NBC', 'believe', 'concerned', 'two', 'investigators', 'detectives', 'thing', 'made', 'show', 'interesting', 'was', 'showcased', 'then', 'new', 'sport', 'skydiving', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'anything', 'remember', 'watching', 'breathlessly.Another', 'thing', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'co-starred', 'Ken', 'Curtis', 'Gunsmoke', 'Festus', 'Haggen', 'watching', 'Gunsmoke', 'father-in-law', 'John', 'Ford', 'westerns', 'including', 'classic', 'Searchers', 'John', 'Wayne', 'Alamo', 'etc.', 'was', 'nice', 'watch', 'totally', 'modern', 'role', 'will', 'be', 'fun', 'see', 'again', 'other', 'star', 'series', 'Larry', 'Pennell', 'became', 'character', 'actor', 'tv', 'appeared', 'tons', 'tv', 'series.Obviously', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'series', '50', 'years', 'still', 'have', 'Dell', 'comic', 'book', 'am', 'greatly', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again']",Ripcord TV Series: Complete Season 1 Gift Set

Each episode begins with a skydiver leaping from a plane and Larry Pennell saying &#34;This is the most danger packed show on television...&#34;  It really brings back the memories.

1648828,AOE0XMITAJWDT,B00CMQIDVI,Terry Sunday,"[5, 5]","While the old 1961-63 television series ""Ripcord"" was not something I've thought very much about in recent years, my interest in it re-surfaced when it became available on DVD. It's been so long ago that I've forgotten the details, but I do know that, as a teenager, I avidly watched the shows when they aired. And I suspect the weekly episodes strongly influenced me to take up the then-new sport of skydiving several years later, a sport I pursued with great enthusiasm until its costs exceeded my starving-college-student budget. Be that as it may, I was really anxious to get my hands on the DVD set so I could once again enjoy the thrilling aerial adventures of skydivers Ted McKeever and Jim Buckley.I was not disappointed. The ""Ripcord Complete Season 1"" DVD set contains 38 episodes on five disks, each one about 23 minutes or so of glorious full-screen black-and-white classic television. The disks come in two traditional DVD cases, labeled ""Vol. 1"" and ""Vol. 2,"" with three disks in the first case (all mounted on a single spindle from which two had come loose during shipping in my package) and two on separate spindles in the second. A nice-but-superfluous cardboard box holds the cases. It features the same front-cover artwork as the individual cases and a full episode list on the back.As for the episodes themselves--well, based on the few I've sampled so far, they're great fun to see again after so many years. Yes, they can be corny compared to modern (but not necessarily better) standards. The actors' performances tend to be low-key but competent, given that the real stars of the show are the skydiving stunts, which were filmed as they happened without tricks or special effects. The stories can be a little strained as they try to make the plot point of skydiving fit into unlikely situations. But the episodes are pretty sharp and have excellent contrast, with just a little digital banding in the skies of some scenes. And, thankfully (hurrah!), the dialog is clear, crisp and comprehensible, a relative rarity these days.If you're a fan of the good old days of television, you can't go wrong with ""Ripcord.""",5,Another Great Old TV Show on DVD!,1375920000,"08 8, 2013",2013,2136,"['old', '1961-63', 'television', 'series', 'Ripcord', 'was', 'not', 'something', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'very', 'much', 'recent', 'years', 'interest', 're-surfaced', 'when', 'became', 'available', 'DVD', 'been', 'so', 'long', ""'ve"", 'forgotten', 'details', 'do', 'know', 'teenager', 'avidly', 'watched', 'shows', 'when', 'aired', 'suspect', 'weekly', 'episodes', 'strongly', 'influenced', 'take', 'up', 'then-new', 'sport', 'skydiving', 'several', 'years', 'later', 'sport', 'pursued', 'great', 'enthusiasm', 'costs', 'exceeded', 'starving-college-student', 'budget', 'Be', 'may', 'was', 'really', 'anxious', 'get', 'hands', 'DVD', 'set', 'so', 'could', 'once', 'again', 'enjoy', 'thrilling', 'aerial', 'adventures', 'skydivers', 'Ted', 'McKeever', 'Jim', 'Buckley.I', 'was', 'not', 'disappointed', 'Ripcord', 'Complete', 'Season', '1', 'DVD', 'set', 'contains', '38', 'episodes', 'five', 'disks', 'one', '23', 'minutes', 'so', 'glorious', 'full-screen', 'black-and-white', 'classic', 'television', 'disks', 'come', 'two', 'traditional', 'DVD', 'cases', 'labeled', 'Vol', '1', 'Vol', '2', 'three', 'disks', 'first', 'case', 'mounted', 'single', 'spindle', 'two', 'had', 'come', 'loose', 'shipping', 'package', 'two', 'separate', 'spindles', 'second', 'nice-but-superfluous', 'cardboard', 'box', 'cases', 'same', 'front-cover', 'artwork', 'individual', 'cases', 'full', 'episode', 'list', 'back.As', 'episodes', 'well', 'based', 'few', ""'ve"", 'sampled', 'so', 'far', ""'re"", 'great', 'fun', 'see', 'again', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'Yes', 'can', 'be', 'corny', 'compared', 'modern', 'not', 'necessarily', 'better', 'standards', 'actors', 'performances', 'tend', 'be', 'low-key', 'competent', 'given', 'real', 'stars', 'show', 'are', 'skydiving', 'stunts', 'were', 'filmed', 'happened', 'tricks', 'special', 'effects', 'stories', 'can', 'be', 'little', 'strained', 'try', 'make', 'plot', 'point', 'skydiving', 'fit', 'unlikely', 'situations', 'episodes', 'are', 'pretty', 'sharp', 'have', 'excellent', 'contrast', 'just', 'little', 'digital', 'banding', 'skies', 'scenes', 'thankfully', 'hurrah', 'dialog', 'clear', 'crisp', 'comprehensible', 'relative', 'rarity', 'days.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'television', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'wrong', 'Ripcord']",Ripcord TV Series: Complete Season 1 Gift Set
