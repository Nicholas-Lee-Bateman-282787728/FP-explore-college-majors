884143,A1JP6SSS7BZJYP,B0007NN6JC,Adam Lampe,"[2, 3]","Cop shows and sit-coms are two of New York's cultural gifts to the world, and this terrific show succeeds in both genres. As a cop show it seems authentic - work is secondary to gossip and various private pursuits (like any office job, then), and the only cases that get solved are the ones thrown in our heroes laps. The comedy arises out of the multi-faceted characterisation, and is dark, biting and satirical. The scripts are superb, helped by the sensible half-hour running time, and they're incredibly dense for a TV show. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why it took a while to find an audience. It's a shame, because the last half dozen episodes are brilliant. Season Three could have been stellar.The DVD presentation is fullsome, with commentaries, interviews, bloopers and behind-the-scenes features.",5,Cop Show as Jazz instead of Blues,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,812,"['Cop', 'shows', 'sit-coms', 'are', 'two', 'New', 'York', 'cultural', 'gifts', 'world', 'terrific', 'show', 'genres', 'cop', 'show', 'authentic', 'work', 'secondary', 'gossip', 'various', 'private', 'pursuits', 'office', 'job', 'then', 'only', 'cases', 'get', 'solved', 'are', 'ones', 'thrown', 'heroes', 'laps', 'comedy', 'multi-faceted', 'characterisation', 'dark', 'biting', 'satirical', 'scripts', 'are', 'superb', 'helped', 'sensible', 'half-hour', 'running', 'time', ""'re"", 'incredibly', 'dense', 'TV', 'show', 'Perhaps', 'one', 'reasons', 'why', 'took', 'while', 'find', 'audience', 'shame', 'last', 'half', 'dozen', 'episodes', 'are', 'brilliant', 'Season', 'Three', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'stellar.The', 'DVD', 'presentation', 'fullsome', 'commentaries', 'interviews', 'bloopers', 'behind-the-scenes', 'features']",The Job - The Complete Series

It was too bad ABC could not stay the course and would not let this show grow. The complete series only lasted 19 episodes, but they are as good in 2007 as the espisodes were in the year 2001.Leary plasys Mike McNeil, a tough as nails cop who has an opinon on everything. He is partner with Pip (Bill Nunn), who is McNeil friend and voice of reason. Diane Farr (Numb3rs),Lenny Clarke and Keith David (the voice of Spawn-the HBO cartoon) are supporting players, as was the crew in Barney Miller was to Hal Linden.The comedic timing in every day situations makes this show work and make this show as timely as it was in 2001. My favorite episodes are both on the first disk, Elizabeth (with Special Guest Star Elizabeth Hurley ) and Bathroom (where Mike is held at gunpoint in a john)ABC, you canceled Kevin Smith's Clerks the Cartoon and This show, maybe you need to think before you cancel quality and niche shows.

I truly believe this to be one of the funniest Major Network cop shows ever appearing on TV.  It is chock full of belly laughs.  I find it hard to believe that this, Boomtown, and other great series dramas don't bring in the viewers and sell the network.  I blame it on marketing, but what the heck do I know, I'm just a clog in a big wheel.Dennis Leary carries this one high above other shows he's appeared on, though I see Rescue Me is doing quite well.  His relaxed scumbag character works very well for him.

So, I'm confused by this.  When I watched the show, in the order on the DVD set, it seemed to work for me. And the final episode, Betrayal, left several cliff hangers, that made you want to watch the next season.  Can anyone enlighten me on this?Possible spoiler:  I also loved the running gag about the detective (name?) who never talks.  And in the final episode, Betrayal, he damages his mouth, and then decides to start talking, and nobody, except the other detectives can understand him.  Halarious!  Anyone else catch this?

With a sharp-witted irreverant script and a uniformly great cast, it should have run longer than 19 episodes.Denis Leary, co-creator, co-producer and co-writer (with Peter Tolan) stars as unscrupulous Mike MacNeil, a pill-popping chain-smoking NYC Detective trying to keep his wife/family, 26 year old girlfriend and job all in balance. When the show ended, everything was unravelling in his life....The rest of the cast is just too good to single anyone out, even with the recurring ""guest"" roles - with one stand out there being Janet Hubert-Whitten. Although listed as appearing in only four episodes as Bill Nunn's (Pip) iron fisted domineering wife Adina, her presence is felt in nearly every episode looming over the whipped Pip like a dark menacing cloud.Nothing whatever is sacred whether it be race, religion or severed body parts. Case in point would be Lt. Williams, played in the pilot episode by Richard Gant, who can't remember the two Hispanic detective's names and calls them rice and beans (""I've been a detective for 36 years...I'm too old to learn new names"")While many things in the show would be offensive if they were played straight, the brilliant scripts don't pull it's punches on any topic and delivers dead-pan humor with gleeful zest.The four DVD set comes nicely packaged and has few, but substantial extras, including interviews and a gag reel.

884151,A1BIC919AYK4RJ,B0007NN6JC,"MotoJunkie ""Wear short sleeves! Support your ...","[1, 1]","Before the huge FX hit of Rescue Me, there was ""The Job"".  A show that had great potential but was cancelled because ABC just didn't have the vision of the appeal.  Though cancelled, The Job was a great experimentation lab of portraying NYC's finest on ABC that evolved into portraying NYC's bravest on FX.The Job stars Denis Leary as NYC detective Mike McNeil as a cop with typical drinking, smoking, self-medicating, and girlfriend/marriage issues.  While out of the house, he manages to cope in rather ""unorthodox"" ways (i.e indulging in his vices) with his girlfriend on the side.At work Leary is joined by many other cast members (Lenny Clarke, Adam Ferrara, and Diane Farr) that are recognizable from Rescue Me that makeup an absurd rag-tag bunch of detectives that take on some rather strange cases (involving anything from chasing a man in a wheelchair, and almost losing him, protecting movie stars Elizabeth Hurley and Gina Gershon, and spying on women using a telescope from evidence lockup).  I don't know if I laughed more at the humor itself or just thinking of the fact that ABC was owned by Disney by this time and they actually let this air...for TWO SEASONS!This show is not based on typical police procedurals like NYPD Blue or Law & Order.  The Job is more of a short comedy sitcom that dwells on the ridiculous events that seem to happen on a day to day basis for Det. McNeill and his squad, landing him in hot water with their Captain.  The Job does not always end up with an arrest in every instance.Special features includes standard gag reels, interviews, and promo commercials.  Some select episodes also include a commentary for that particular episode.  The commentary must have been done quite some time after the show and well into a season or two of Rescue Me, because creators Denis Leary and Peter Tolan bring Rescue Me into the mix of the commentary many times.  So you probably won't get commentary that properly reflects the creators of this show as how this show ties into Rescue Me as a building block to the FX big leagues.If you like Rescue Me, this one is worth it.",5,The Roots of Rescue Me,1245110400,"06 16, 2009",2009,2106,"['huge', 'FX', 'hit', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'was', 'Job', 'show', 'had', 'great', 'potential', 'was', 'cancelled', 'because', 'ABC', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'vision', 'appeal', 'Though', 'cancelled', 'Job', 'was', 'great', 'experimentation', 'lab', 'portraying', 'NYC', 'finest', 'ABC', 'evolved', 'portraying', 'NYC', 'bravest', 'FX.The', 'Job', 'stars', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'NYC', 'detective', 'Mike', 'McNeil', 'cop', 'typical', 'drinking', 'smoking', 'self-medicating', 'girlfriend/marriage', 'issues', 'house', 'cope', 'rather', 'unorthodox', 'ways', 'i.e', 'indulging', 'vices', 'girlfriend', 'side.At', 'work', 'Leary', 'joined', 'many', 'other', 'cast', 'members', 'Lenny', 'Clarke', 'Adam', 'Ferrara', 'Diane', 'Farr', 'are', 'recognizable', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'makeup', 'absurd', 'rag-tag', 'bunch', 'detectives', 'take', 'rather', 'strange', 'cases', 'involving', 'anything', 'chasing', 'man', 'wheelchair', 'almost', 'losing', 'protecting', 'movie', 'stars', 'Elizabeth', 'Hurley', 'Gina', 'Gershon', 'spying', 'women', 'using', 'telescope', 'evidence', 'lockup', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'laughed', 'more', 'humor', 'just', 'thinking', 'fact', 'ABC', 'was', 'owned', 'Disney', 'time', 'actually', 'let', 'air', 'TWO', 'SEASONS', 'show', 'not', 'based', 'typical', 'police', 'procedurals', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Law', 'Order', 'Job', 'more', 'short', 'comedy', 'sitcom', 'ridiculous', 'events', 'seem', 'happen', 'day', 'day', 'basis', 'Det', 'McNeill', 'squad', 'landing', 'hot', 'water', 'Captain', 'Job', 'not', 'always', 'end', 'up', 'arrest', 'instance.Special', 'features', 'standard', 'gag', 'reels', 'interviews', 'promo', 'commercials', 'select', 'episodes', 'also', 'include', 'commentary', 'particular', 'episode', 'commentary', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'quite', 'time', 'show', 'well', 'season', 'two', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'creators', 'Denis', 'Leary', 'Peter', 'Tolan', 'bring', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'mix', 'commentary', 'many', 'times', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'commentary', 'properly', 'creators', 'show', 'how', 'show', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'building', 'block', 'FX', 'big', 'leagues.If', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'one']",The Job - The Complete Series

Sharing a sense of humor and a working-class Irish background, the two clicked so well Leary decided to turn the veteran detective's stories into his first TV series. Originally planned for a series run on HBO, it wasn't until Peter Tolan (The Larry Sanders Show) came on as executive producer that ABC got interested, offering a bigger budget. In exchange for giving up cable's freedom to use the ""F-word,"" ABC let Leary ""do the show his way."" The result was The Job, an acerbic crossing of Hill Street Blues with NYPD Blue and Barney Miller.Denis Leary plays Mike McNeil, a good cop with a bad attitude who's made a name for himself by bending the rules; juggling ""the job,"" a suburban wife (Wendy Makkena), a manhattan girlfriend (Karyn Parsons), too much booze and too many pills. Armed with a superbly hilarious ensemble cast and smart & edgy writing, The Job was easily the funniest new show of 2001. The unforgettable supporting cast includes Bill Nunn (Do The Right Thing, Spider-Man films) as Mike's partner Pip Phillips; gorgeous Diane Farr (Roswell, Loveline) as Det. Jan Fendrich; Adam Ferrara and Lenny Clarke as detectives Tommy Manetti & Frank Harrigan; Julian Acosta and John Ortiz as rookie detectives Al Rodriguez & Ruben Sommariba; and Keith David (The Thing, Gargoyles) as Mike's frustrated boss Lt. Tom Williams.With all 19 episodes from the critically-acclaimed series, it's laughter in the first degree with The Job - The Complete Series.

I knew from the couple episodes I had seen that I would be buying the series as soon as it came out.If you're a ""Rescue Me"" fan then you'll recognize several of the same actors are in both series (Not usually to the same extent as they wer in The Job)  The humor from the job transferred easily into Rescue, but The Job was basically a comedy where as Rescue is more of a comedy drama.If you're a fan of Rescue Me then you really should get this series.  There are some episodes that are so funny all the way through that my stomache was sore from laughing so much.  One of my favorites was when the detectives from the precinct of the main characters was called to invesitgate a corpse of some homeless guy.  After questioning a witness they figured that the detective for the adjoining precinct had lifted the body over the fence so that he wouldn't be stuck with the paper work.  So the same body kept getting dumped back and forth in different locations until someone at the newspaper caught wind of a series of bodies being found in the two precincts as if there was some muder spree going on.The Job was so funny and original that I just couldn't believe the show would get axed before it had time to build a bigger audience....Anyway this is a damn good laugh though and through....The bonus interviews were pretty good too.",5,Before Rescue,1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,1457,"['really', 'had', ""n't"", 'heard', 'Job', 'tried', 'make', 'final', 'effort', 'get', 'more', 'viewers', '.and', 'then', 'was', 'cancelled', 'knew', 'couple', 'had', 'seen', 'would', 'be', 'buying', 'series', 'as', 'soon', 'came', 'out.If', ""'re"", 'Rescue', 'Me', 'fan', 'then', ""'ll"", 'recognize', 'several', 'same', 'actors', 'are', 'series', 'Not', 'usually', 'same', 'extent', 'wer', 'Job', 'humor', 'job', 'transferred', 'easily', 'Rescue', 'Job', 'was', 'basically', 'comedy', 'where', 'Rescue', 'more', 'comedy', 'drama.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'then', 'really', 'should', 'get', 'series', 'are', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'funny', 'way', 'stomache', 'was', 'sore', 'laughing', 'so', 'much', 'One', 'favorites', 'was', 'when', 'detectives', 'precinct', 'main', 'characters', 'was', 'called', 'invesitgate', 'corpse', 'homeless', 'guy', 'questioning', 'witness', 'figured', 'detective', 'adjoining', 'precinct', 'had', 'lifted', 'body', 'fence', 'so', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'stuck', 'paper', 'work', 'same', 'body', 'kept', 'getting', 'dumped', 'back', 'forth', 'different', 'locations', 'someone', 'newspaper', 'caught', 'wind', 'series', 'bodies', 'being', 'found', 'two', 'precincts', 'was', 'muder', 'spree', 'going', 'on.The', 'Job', 'was', 'so', 'funny', 'original', 'just', 'could', ""n't"", 'believe', 'show', 'would', 'get', 'axed', 'had', 'time', 'build', 'bigger', 'audience', '.Anyway', 'damn', 'good', 'laugh', '.The', 'bonus', 'interviews', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'too']",The Job - The Complete Series

Actually, no it wasn't .... this show was too smart and too funny for ABC and the average Raymond-watching couch potato.  So, like all intelligently hysterical shows, it had to die an early death.  OK, enough editorializing! :)I don't remember any particulars (sorry!) as it's been so long since I saw this show, all I remember is from the end of one episode looking forward *all week* until the next one came out!  It was filled with wicked black humor, as anyone familiar with Denis Leary would expect.  The supporting cast were just fantastic ... the two standouts I recall in particular were a big, older white guy and a black guy.  (Gee that's helpful, huh?  Go ahead and click the 'this review not helpful' link - I deserve it!)  The chemistry of these two actors with DL was just fantastic.  This show had me in tears each week, it was so funny, and so fresh, and so unlike anything else on TV at the time.I'm ordering this TONIGHT and paying extra for the overnight shipping, that's how badly I want to have this DVD in my possession!  And it will be worth every penny!",5,FINALLY!!!!!!
