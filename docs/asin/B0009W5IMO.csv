Obviously this was an HBO series which I didn't see. If I had, I would just have been watching a repeat.

914124,A3080YC6R9G303,B0009W5IMO,Greg Robertson,"[7, 9]","The subtitle to this film is more pertinent than most: ""Every small town has a big story.""  That reveals a lot more about this two-part HBO film than does the title,  although that also works hard by doing double duty as both the town name and the hint of a parable in play.  Having grown up in a small town whose factories and industry went through considerable down years, as most of America's have, I can say that Russo has captured much of the interaction between lifelong residents of a once prosperous, now stagnant town very well.If you love Richard Russo's storytelling, as I do, you'll feel that in this film from the very beginning.  If you're not familiar with him, though, it may at first come off as slow.  Russo, who wrote the screenplay based on his book, takes his time to paint the picture of what Empire Falls was before and is now, so enjoy the light humor and the local in-fighting, but also pay attention. The details Russo sprinkles into this mosaic upfront will show up again later, as things tend to do between people and families in small towns.The cast is incredible for such a small film.  Ed Harris is perfect as Miles Roby, the local guy who is so smart that everyone in town always wonders why he still lives there.  As Roby's cantankerous father, Max, Paul Newman is the perfect blend of hilariously cantankerous and forever beaten down by life.  I also really liked Helen Hunt in this, specifically because her character is so unlikeable - an unusual role for her.  Dennis Farina is also good, as always, this time as the town phony who always acts surprised that anyone would think he's a phony.  And Mrs. Newman, Joanne Woodward, is just terrific in the only ""bitch from hell"" role I've ever see her play.I also think that how much you enjoy ""Empire Falls"" will be influenced by what you expect going into it.  It IS long - a two-parter on two DVDs - so make time, perhaps over two nights.  The humor is subtle, but funny, and does depend on listening to the dialogue, of which there is a lot.  The story seems straightforward, but then takes some unexpected turns, as it should.  But, overall, this film is about people and how they interact and struggle with others they've known their entire lives -- and will still be surrounded by tomorrow -- whether they like it or not.Finally, the DVDs themselves also have a lot of extras that are worth a look.  Interviews with cast members, the director, and, best of all, with Richard Russo himself.

914132,A1IWWRZJOXOSYP,B0009W5IMO,Lee Armstrong,"[2, 7]","""Empire Falls"" is an amazing production, nominated for an Emmy for best mini-series or TV movie.  The HBO mini-series is in two parts with four ""chapters"" on each DVD.  Australian director Fred Schepisi does an excellent job with the pacing in each segment.  He previously directed ""Roxanne"" (1987) with Steve Martin and ""The Russia House"" (1990) with Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer.  He was nominated for a Best Director Emmy for this series.This show has an amazing all-star cast.  The lead is Ed Harris as Miles Robey.  Poor Ed!  He's been nominated for four Oscars, three times in the supporting category [""Apollo 13"" (1995), ""The Truman Show,"" (1998), ""The Hours"" (2002)], and once for Best Actor for ""Pollock"" (2000).  He finally gets nominated for a Best Actor Emmy and doesn't win.  But his performance is intense as the responsible son who runs the Empire Grill.The only Emmy the show did win was for Paul Newman who played the obstreperous ex-con daddy Max who bugs out for Florida on money stolen from the church cashbox.  Newman's career has included a long list of Oscar nominations for Best Actor [""Cat On a Hot Tin Roof"" (1958), ""The Hustler"" (1961), ""Hud"" (1963), ""Cool Hand Luke"" (1967), ""Absence of Malice"" (1981), ""The Verdict"" (1982) & ""Nobody's Fool"" (1994)] and as Best Supporting Actor for ""The Road to Perdition"" (2002).  He'll have this Emmy to join his Oscar for 1986's ""The Color of Money.""  He does an amazing job, both comic and dramatic!  My favorite moment in the series is when we realize that Max probably knows that David is not his biological son, but claims him without reservation.As the wealthy town matron Francine Whiting, Joanne Woodward also has a long list of credits.  She won the Oscar for ""The Three Faces of Eve"" in 1957 as well as for nominations for ""Rachel, Rachel"" (1968), ""Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams"" (1973), and ""Mr. & Mrs. Bridge"" (1990).  She was nominated here for the Best Supporting Actress Emmy as the icy-veined wheeler dealer who manipulates the town's purse strings and the lives of many of its residents.  Her cat in the series deserves a special mention who should win a ""Meanest Cat"" award!Helen Hunt who won her Best Actress Oscar for ""As Good As It Gets"" in 1997 plays Ed Robey's wife Janine, an insecure woman who needs love.  Danielle Panabaker from ""Sky High"" plays Tick their daughter.  It's one of the scariest sequences when a preoccupied Janine tries to drive away before Tick is all the way out of the car and drags her.  Philip Seymour Hoffman who was great as the runaway preacher in ""Cold Mountain"" was nominated for Best Supporting Actor Emmy as C.B. Whiting, the man who flees to Mexico and shoots himself in the head rather than live with Francine.There are numerous other fine supporting performances.  Perhaps the most chilling is Lou Taylor Pucci who plays loner John Voss.  Pucci played another loaner recently in ""Thumbsucker"" with Keeanu Reeves and serves as the butt of local kids' jokes until pushed over the edge.  The Columbine-type ending seems to come from the blue, but Taylor is marvelous with few words.Aiden Quinn from ""Cavedweller"" plays Miles' brother David.  Robin Wright Penn plays their mother Grace in the series' many flashbacks.  William Fichtner from ""Black Hawk Down"" & ""The Perfect Storm"" plays small-town cop Jimmy Minty who has a chip on his shoulder where Miles is concerned.  His son Zack is played by Trevor Morgan who also played the bully in ""The Sixth Sense"" and was in ""The Patriot.""  He does a great job of pushing John Voss over the edge.  Newcomer Delia Robertson plays Tick's friend Candace who gets shot in the art room.  Kate Burton who is doing a super job in her re-occurring role in TV's ""Gray's Anatomy"" as Dr. Gray, the alzheimer mother patient of the main character, and who will soon be in ""Stay"" with Ewan McGregor, Naomi Watts & Ryan Gosling, is excellent as the handicapped Cindy Whiting who has a crush on Miles.  Theresa Russell as Charlene, the stoned waitress, does a great job.The cast is excellent in this mini-series.  The direction is excellent.  The metaphor of the Maine town ""Empire Falls"" where we watch the Whiting empire also fall is excellent writing and earned a deserved Emmy nomination for Richard Russo.  This 2-disc series is a treat & thrill.

914137,A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ,B0009W5IMO,"Michael W. Kennedy ""insane book lover""","[3, 4]","EMPIRE FALLS is the HBO-produced version of the Pulitzer-Prize winning novel by Richard Russo. It boasts a star-studded cast for a TV production (Ed Harris, Paul Newman, Helen Hunt and Joanne Woodward) but then some of HBO's products exhibit better acting than many big-screen releases. I like EMPIRE FALLS. The first chapter or two dragged a little and I was debating whether to turn it off. But I hung in there, wanting, I guess, to see what happens to the characters, espectially Miles Roby (Ed Harris) who apparently has been stalled in life by some traumatic events experienced as a boy. As a result, he seems unable to get unstuck from managing the Empire Grill for the towns's richest citizen (Joannne Woodward). There is a bit of class struggle here (why is the ""evil"" character always the rich one?), but all-in-all it dealt with life in a small New England town fairly even-handedly. You may want to impatiently nudge Miles out of his funk as his friends do but his character is also symbolic of how many of us find ourselves stuck in life without an impetus for change. We all just don't have a powerful rich woman holding us in psychological thrall as an excuse. There is a fistfight between Miles and another character that is one of the most realistic fights I've seen on film: they actually hold their hands in pain after hitting each other on the head, which is almost never done in other film fights. That kind of attention to detail is exhibited throughout the film and can be credited to director Fred Schepisi. Mr. Russo wrote the screenplay. Paul Newman is a delight as Mile's undependable father(see him in NOBODY'S FOOL, another Russo book-to-film) and Helen Hunt is fine as Mile's soon-to-be-ex-wife.

Though it starts off slow the superb acting just draws you in and I enjoyed every minute of it. If you enjoy any HBO movies than you will love Empire Falls.Empire Falls is a small town set in New England where life is simple and everyone knows everybody. But for Miles Roby, a man who has been working in the same grill for most of his life, there's something missing. He feels that Mrs. Whiting who owns the grill has it in for him and he doesn't seen anything extraordinary happening in his life. He's been through a divorce and his ex-wife Janine is about to get remarried something his daughter Tick doesn't want to happen at all. Miles also has to put up with his senile father Max who thinks everyone has it in for him.Miles frequently has flashback of his childhood when his mother was still alive and he tries to remember Charlie Mayne who he hates but he can't really figure out what happened to him. His daughter Tick is also trying to connect with a tortured boy who she tries to help but realizes he's beyond her saving.

With a screenplay by the author of the Pulitzer prize winning author, Richard Russo, each word and scene resonates with just as marvelous novel.First, the cast is superb. Paul Newman, havinf starred in anearlier film based on a Russo novel, saw the emotional tale in the novel, approached HBO, and had himself cast as the mischevious Max, father of the protagonist, Max Brody. Max, played to further perfection by Ed Harris, lost his once-fat wife (Helen Hunt) to the spa owner windbag, played by a cast-against-type Dennis Farina. Jaonne Woodward is the antagonist/villian, in a story that plays out against the backdrop of a crumbling industrial city in Maine. A manipulative matriarch makes life miserable for many.Russo wrote much of the book in a setting, a decaying town in New England, and he admittedly drew from the lives of his own teenage daughters to flesh out the role of Tick, Max's daughter. Here too, Tick and her youthful colleagues play their roles very well. They play out the drama created by the adults, witness a tragedy, and allow the adults to come to terms after one more death.The DVD version closes perhaps to quickly, and the classroom tragedy late in the film is a bit melodramatic.

914143,A39IY0JU5JI69G,B0009W5IMO,"Promise ""promise""","[1, 1]","I'm scratching my head, wondering what was lacking in this DVD for me.  The cast could not be better---each actor was wonderul, and Ed Harris, the lead certainly held my interest.  The story was interesting and worth telling, and it seemed good that they took their time in telling it---not trying to crowd a novel into a two hour movie.The closest I can come to for an explanation of my lack of real enthusiasm for it is the tone.  It really tells a very dark story and although it's nice to enter into it with all the ordinariness of small town life, but it doesn't adequately prepare us for the really terrible revelations that occur later in the film.  I left it with the impression of all the nice folks together eating donuts at the Empire grill.  Perhaps it was the cinematograpy---just too much light and shots of the pretty New England town.  It was too uniformly sunny...for the dark subject matter. The development of the character depended on his digging into the darkness of his past and this was not adequately represented in the style of the film.The main idea of the film was the development of the emotionally watered down grill owner (Ed Harris) who is obviously an underachiever.  We hear he got straight A's in school and went to college, which was unusual in that town, and yet here he is, working for the town Tyrant (Woodward) managing the small restaurant for the last twenty years with no end in sight.  He's great looking and charming but his wife left him for an obvious bozo.  His daughter begs him to stand up and stop the marriage but he's so nice and easy going that he just makes her promise to be a bridesmaid.  Perhaps, as another reviewer suggested, Harris is just too naturally virile and macho to play such a wimpy character.  (I loved him in History of Violence)When he finally breaks out, he's not convincing either.  The fight with the cop is good and it's satisfying to hear him tell off the town witch but he still seems rather sappy to me....spending an awful lot of time hugging his daughter.  (If the characters in this story spent more time hugging their mates rather than their kids, they might all have been better off.)The ending was not clear to me.  Does he go back to his really drippy ex-wife (Helen Hunt)?  and go into business with his mother-in-law?  (I'd hoped he would steal the cute blond waitress away from his step-brother.)Another thought:  maybe it was the enormous joy that Paul Newman obviously took in playing his character that sort of spoiled the darkness of the film.

914144,A9MOZDD4DO6FY,B0009W5IMO,"Robert M. Penna ""Dr. Bob""","[19, 21]","This HBO adaptation had four things going for it that almost guaranteed its success before a single camera began rolling.The first was the fact that it was based upon Richard Russo's award-winning book of the same name.  The second was that Russo himself wrote the adapted screenplay.  The third was the incredible, all-star cast; and the fourth was that it was an HBO production. Each of these elements contributes to a mini-series now available on DVD and one that is not to be missed.Let's start with the story.  No one, absolutely no one, captures small town America the way Richard Russo does.  Unlike some writers whose only real acquaintance with this setting seems to be either a brief glimpse from the Interstate or, worse, some other Hollywood writer's impression, Russo writes as though he actually spent years in the former mill towns, sitting at the diner, the tavern, or the doughnut shop soaking in the lost dreams and dead-end futures that haunt many of the residents of these communities.  But unlike writers who see only despair in such a setting, Russo captures -but never makes light of- the small victories that the locals do grab onto to make life worth living.  Odd as it may seem to the Sacks Fifth Avenue set, it IS possible to have a fulfilling life without ever owning a Gucci...and Russo is the master of introducing audiences to such lives.  It is the audience's further fortune to have Russo acting here as his own screenwriter.  The tweaks, cuts and short cuts necessary to make a novel into a workable screen presentation were thereby handled lovingly by their creator.  He did not leave in too much, he did cut too much.  True, the mini-series format gave him extra room to work, but he did the most with it and the audience is the clear beneficiary.The casting is spot-on.  Ed Harris plays the central character, Miles, with an easy grace that belies the fact that this is acting, while Paul Newman has a ball playing Miles' irascible and irredeemable father, Max.  Two other casting bull's eyes were scored with Philip Seymour Hoffman as the enigmatic Charlie Mayne, and William Fichtner as Deputy Jimmy Minty, a role that clearly anticipates his current starring slot in TV's ""Invasion.""  The rest of the cast is similarly perfect and there is not a bad performance in the lot.HBO has shown time and again that when its name is on a production, the result is going to truly be something worth watching, even if the usual Hollywood glitz is not attached to it.  Instead of making a splash, HBO seems to be intent upon producing quiet gems, and that is what this film is.  Read the book, and then see the movie.  Or do it the other way around.

914149,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B0009W5IMO,S. Spilka,"[4, 5]","Sometimes movies measure up to books, as in Somerset Maugham's The Painted Veil. Sometimes movies may be even better than padded and chatty novels, as for example in Oblomov. But in the present case, the movie version of Empire Falls is all wrong. As one reviewer has already pointed out, the movie is too sunny whereas the book is dark, pessimistic, and sometimes despairing. The slow, maudlin music is distracting and misleading. The views are boring. And the pace of the whole thing is painfully slow and stupifying. The book has the depth of a Dostoevsky; the movie does its best to flatten and sentimentalize the plot and the characters. For example, an important aspect of Miles's personality is that he is a reader, and that's what he so much enjoyed in college: ""He hadn't been a college freshman for more than a few weeks before deciding that this was where he belonged, among people who loved books and art and music..."" (390) I can not figure out why this line was omitted from the script. Another one of the most moving passages in the book also fell flat in the movie. I am referring to Miles' thoughts after the shooting at the school, when he passed by his daughter and didn't see her at first. This is what torments him later: ""Wasn't there something in a father, he asked himself, some extra sense, that should've told him right where she'd be? Wasn't she his only daughter? A better father would've been able to find her blind-folded, in the dark, attracted by the invisible beacon of her suffering"" (454). Nothing of this eloquence, this richness, this love came across in the movie. Ed Harris, an actor I admire, was the wrong choice for Miles. He failed to portray Miles's depth, intelligence, and layers of insight and generosity. He just stood there, without a subtext, not knowing what to do with himself, how to bring this complex character to life. Of course, there's also the director who failed to see how slow and boring his production had become. Paul Newman, as Miles's father, was not half as crazy and wild as he should have been according to Russo's book, and Joanne Woodward was not half as evil as she is in the book. Only Helen Hunt, in my opinion, lived up to her fictive role. How disappointing! But most disappointing of all is the fact that Russo himself wrote the script for this production, which missed many of his own best lines; he also participated actively in its creation. Why? Why? I can't figure this out. Why did he choose to cheapen, simplify, and deaden his own great work?

914151,A2YDVQRBG8T3D7,B0009W5IMO,"Theresa Williams ""Zen""","[2, 14]","No, this was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was very disappointing, especially given the cast of fine actors.  I enjoyed NOBODY'S FOOL, a film adaptation of a Russo novel, but EMPIRE FALLS had very few moments of authentic emotion.Hoffman, as the doomed lover of Miles Robey's (Harris) mother (Penn) does give a quietly affecting performance.  Penn is also affecting as the mother who swallows her dignity and sacrifices her chance at love for the sake of her small son.  However, these performances are not enough to carry the movie.  Harris, usually a strong actor, is curiously low-key, as though going through the motions of acting rather than actually acting, and Newman's portrayal of Robey's much-absent father is too farcical to ever elicit any sympathy for his character.Perhaps the worst aspect of the film is the overly dramatic plot element of the Columbine-like shooting, which tips Robey's daughter over the edge and is supposed to provide the resolution of the conflicts.  I found such a devastating event to be unwarranted in a movie that, up until that point, seemed to be a satirical comedy about a disentegrating town.Moreover, many of the characters' motivations are not effectively portrayed.  I also found the voice-over narration to be distracting, irritating, and out of step with the rest of the movie.All in all, this movie did not raise itself above the quality of a Hallmark Hall of Fame Movie.  The movie is almost completely devoid of emotion, and it also lacks dramatic tension, making it mostly a dull experience with brief moments of charm.",2,Very disappointing,1146700800,"05 4, 2006",2006,1587,"['was', 'not', 'worst', 'movie', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'was', 'very', 'disappointing', 'especially', 'given', 'cast', 'fine', 'actors', 'enjoyed', 'NOBODY', 'FOOL', 'film', 'adaptation', 'Russo', 'novel', 'EMPIRE', 'FALLS', 'had', 'very', 'few', 'moments', 'authentic', 'emotion.Hoffman', 'doomed', 'lover', 'Miles', 'Robey', 'Harris', 'mother', 'Penn', 'give', 'quietly', 'affecting', 'performance', 'Penn', 'also', 'affecting', 'mother', 'who', 'dignity', 'chance', 'love', 'sake', 'small', 'son', 'However', 'performances', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'carry', 'movie', 'Harris', 'usually', 'strong', 'actor', 'curiously', 'low-key', 'going', 'motions', 'acting', 'rather', 'actually', 'acting', 'Newman', 'portrayal', 'Robey', 'much-absent', 'father', 'too', 'farcical', 'ever', 'elicit', 'sympathy', 'character.Perhaps', 'worst', 'aspect', 'film', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'plot', 'element', 'Columbine-like', 'shooting', 'Robey', 'daughter', 'edge', 'supposed', 'provide', 'resolution', 'conflicts', 'found', 'devastating', 'event', 'be', 'unwarranted', 'movie', 'up', 'point', 'seemed', 'be', 'satirical', 'comedy', 'disentegrating', 'town.Moreover', 'many', 'characters', 'motivations', 'are', 'not', 'effectively', 'portrayed', 'also', 'found', 'voice-over', 'narration', 'be', 'distracting', 'irritating', 'step', 'rest', 'movie.All', 'movie', 'did', 'not', 'raise', 'quality', 'Hallmark', 'Hall', 'Fame', 'Movie', 'movie', 'almost', 'completely', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'also', 'dramatic', 'tension', 'making', 'mostly', 'dull', 'experience', 'brief', 'moments', 'charm']",Empire Falls
914152,A2CDMCG1Z84A51,B0009W5IMO,Wanda B. Red,"[3, 5]","HBO hired Richard Russo as screenwriter to turn his Pulitzer Prize winning novel into a TV film. Not only did he have the scope provided by television ( several distinct chapters, three plus hours) to represent the novel properly; he also ended up with a superb, really an inimitable cast: Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Ed Harris, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Robin Wright Penn, Dennis Farina, Helen Hunt, Aidan Quinn, and lesser lights whose day will come. What raw talent!The result is fantastic. I've never seen a film that was so faithful to the novel that prompted it. (And take advantage of the screenwriter/director's commentary really to plumb the depths of this.) ""Empire Falls (the movie)"" is really the test case of the question ""Can a novel truly be turned into a film?"" And the answer is an emphatic ""YES!"" Although I read the book first, with my imagination turned on full force, I will never again be able to visualize the characters of Max Roby and the Silver Fox as anyone but Paul Newman and Dennis Farina.An interesting side question, however: Did Russo realize things about the novel that he got to clarify when he was screenwriter in the film? I certainly thought so. It was suddenly clear to me that old Max Roby was the foil to Francine Whiting, and that the central question of the story was where and how a person determines to express love: The disreputable old charmer Max Roby made the decision to offer love where his ethics and commitment (however doubtful both of these were) told him to, whereas Francine permitted herself to wander away from love to embrace power and revenge. Maybe Russo was bringing out more distinctly what, as author, he knew was already there in the novel, but maybe he was simply realizing in the film for the first time what he had hoped to accomplish in the book (and this latter is what I for one think).Thus, this film is simultaneously a best reading of the book, while also providing a new understanding of it. In any case, how could anyone do anything but recommend it enthusiastically?",5,Incomparable,1158451200,"09 17, 2006",2006,2044,"['HBO', 'hired', 'Richard', 'Russo', 'screenwriter', 'turn', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winning', 'novel', 'TV', 'film', 'Not', 'only', 'did', 'have', 'scope', 'provided', 'television', 'several', 'distinct', 'chapters', 'three', 'hours', 'represent', 'novel', 'properly', 'also', 'ended', 'up', 'superb', 'really', 'inimitable', 'cast', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Joanne', 'Woodward', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'Philip', 'Seymour', 'Hoffman', 'Robin', 'Wright', 'Penn', 'Dennis', 'Farina', 'Helen', 'Hunt', 'Aidan', 'Quinn', 'lesser', 'lights', 'day', 'will', 'come', 'What', 'raw', 'talent', 'result', 'fantastic', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'film', 'was', 'so', 'faithful', 'novel', 'prompted', 'take', 'advantage', 'screenwriter/director', 'commentary', 'really', 'plumb', 'depths', 'Empire', 'Falls', 'movie', 'really', 'test', 'case', 'question', 'Can', 'novel', 'truly', 'be', 'turned', 'film', 'answer', 'emphatic', 'YES', 'read', 'book', 'first', 'imagination', 'turned', 'full', 'force', 'will', 'never', 'again', 'be', 'able', 'visualize', 'characters', 'Max', 'Roby', 'Silver', 'Fox', 'anyone', 'Paul', 'Newman', 'Dennis', 'Farina.An', 'interesting', 'side', 'question', 'however', 'Did', 'Russo', 'realize', 'things', 'novel', 'got', 'clarify', 'when', 'was', 'screenwriter', 'film', 'certainly', 'thought', 'so', 'was', 'suddenly', 'clear', 'old', 'Max', 'Roby', 'was', 'foil', 'Francine', 'Whiting', 'central', 'question', 'story', 'was', 'where', 'how', 'person', 'express', 'love', 'disreputable', 'old', 'charmer', 'Max', 'Roby', 'made', 'decision', 'offer', 'love', 'where', 'ethics', 'commitment', 'however', 'doubtful', 'were', 'told', 'whereas', 'Francine', 'permitted', 'wander', 'away', 'love', 'embrace', 'power', 'revenge', 'Maybe', 'Russo', 'was', 'bringing', 'out', 'more', 'distinctly', 'what', 'author', 'knew', 'was', 'already', 'there', 'novel', 'maybe', 'was', 'simply', 'realizing', 'film', 'first', 'time', 'what', 'had', 'hoped', 'accomplish', 'book', 'latter', 'what', 'one', 'think', '.Thus', 'film', 'simultaneously', 'best', 'reading', 'book', 'also', 'providing', 'new', 'understanding', 'case', 'how', 'could', 'anyone', 'do', 'anything', 'recommend', 'enthusiastically']",Empire Falls
