The girl knows the combination of a safe code belonging to the Chinese Organization that she has been forced to work for. The Russian Mafia wants the safe code and they will do anything to get the little girl. To make things worse, there are corrupted NYC cops that also want the code. Mei's only hope is in the hands of Luke Wright.I was in Walmart earlier today for an errand, but I glanced at the DVDS and found Safe for $14.95. I'm a Statham fan, so I bought the movie without having a clue of what it was really about. The action is top notch and Statham is at his best. The plot is interesting, but is thin and predictable.

There are times when that works really well though. A really cheesy line goes on to be one of the most memorable in action movie history (Die Hard) or a ridiculous movie with an over the top storyline becomes somewhat of a cult classic solely for it being so unbelievable (Crank). Safe is none of those things. It's embarrassing and silly. Safe is like that chunky kid on the playground with pit stains under his armpits and always breathes heavily like he can never catch his breath while wearing suspenders up to his man-boobs, a pocket protector, has worn braces his entire life, and has those thick, coke bottle glasses; he's entertaining for a little while because he's so awkward but then you start to feel bad for him and you just don't really want to look at him anymore.You know you're in for it when the bad acting and lame dialogue not only slaps you in the face but rubs your nose in it literally two or three minutes into the movie. Most of the actors are really terrible, but kind of warm up to their roles as the movie progresses. Mei (Catherine Chan) is the guiltiest offender. She doesn't exactly get better, but she mostly becomes a little less atrocious over time. The rest of the cast doesn't have much room to boast though.""Everyone who has an accent that isn't Jason Statham is a bad man."" This is what Safe would probably say if movies could talk. Safe is a war between the Triads, The Russian mafia, and corrupt New York cops. Stuck in the middle is Mei, a highly intelligent young Chinese girl who's exceptional at math and who has memorized an incredibly long number that's somehow important to all three parties. Luke Wright (Jason Statham), a former cop and cage fighter who has lost everything, steps in to help Mei when he feels like she saved him from the brink of death. Every Russian or Chinese stereotype you can think of seems to be crammed into these characters. Seeing James Hong (Blade Runner, Big Trouble in Little China) and Chris Sarandon (Fright Night, The Princess Bride) enter the picture brought some hope to the film actually being decent, but it didn't last.While most of the characters were very one-dimensional, what will perhaps get to you the most is the way the movie constantly dangles a big fight sequence in front of you before pulling it away right before it actually happens. Just look at everything involving Luke that takes place before the subway station; the cage fight that only shows the end result, him being on his knees in front of the Russian mob as the camera slowly zooms out, and the corrupt cops taking turns beating the tar out of him. You're constantly wondering when Luke is finally going to stand up for himself.Everything is not all bad. Many of the action sequences are worthwhile. The subway scene is when things finally pick up, then there's the car chase that has Statham tapping into his The Transporter and The Italian Job roots, and the entire hotel sequence. Jason Statham is capable of delivering some amazing fight scenes. It's just a shame he constantly decides to be a part of movies that are poorly written. But many of the action scenes are nearly ruined by terrible camera work. A shaky perspective and constant whirring movements don't exactly add anything but nausea to a movie like this.Safe is like a combination of every Jason Statham movie you could possibly think of and that horrible movie Contraband from earlier this year. He plays the exact same character you've come to expect from him. He even set a world record for it. The movie is mostly very predictable and clich&eacute; while Chinese and Russian characters are overly stereotypical. The movie is downright awful until the halfway point where it shuffles around like a shy boy at his first homecoming dance still going through the final stages of puberty and learning how to dance with that girl he's always had a crush on. He gets better as the night goes on, but he was so bad the first half of the night that it can never really make up for that. The one surprising thing comes in the ending, which also just involves teasing the audience; a trait the movie seems to do at least a half a dozen times. You have seen this movie before. Heck, you probably even own it. Why in the world would you willingly pay to see something you've already seen several times before?",2,A familiar and goading excuse of an action movie,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",2012,4450,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'movie', 'time', 'Which', 'bunch', 'guys', 'are', 'going', 'get', 'crap', 'kicked', 'not', 'much', 'else', 'are', 'times', 'when', 'really', 'well', 'really', 'cheesy', 'line', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'memorable', 'action', 'movie', 'history', 'Die', 'Hard', 'ridiculous', 'movie', 'top', 'storyline', 'somewhat', 'cult', 'classic', 'solely', 'being', 'so', 'unbelievable', 'Crank', 'Safe', 'none', 'things', 'embarrassing', 'silly', 'Safe', 'chunky', 'kid', 'playground', 'pit', 'stains', 'armpits', 'always', 'breathes', 'heavily', 'can', 'never', 'catch', 'breath', 'wearing', 'suspenders', 'up', 'man-boobs', 'pocket', 'protector', 'worn', 'braces', 'entire', 'life', 'thick', 'coke', 'bottle', 'glasses', 'entertaining', 'little', 'while', 'so', 'awkward', 'then', 'start', 'feel', 'bad', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'look', 'anymore.You', 'know', ""'re"", 'when', 'bad', 'acting', 'lame', 'dialogue', 'not', 'only', 'face', 'rubs', 'nose', 'literally', 'two', 'three', 'minutes', 'movie', 'Most', 'actors', 'are', 'really', 'terrible', 'kind', 'warm', 'roles', 'movie', 'Mei', 'Catherine', 'Chan', 'guiltiest', 'offender', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'get', 'better', 'mostly', 'little', 'less', 'atrocious', 'time', 'rest', 'cast', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'room', 'boast', 'Everyone', 'who', 'accent', ""n't"", 'Jason', 'Statham', 'bad', 'man', 'what', 'Safe', 'would', 'probably', 'say', 'movies', 'could', 'talk', 'Safe', 'war', 'Triads', 'Russian', 'mafia', 'corrupt', 'New', 'York', 'cops', 'Stuck', 'middle', 'Mei', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'young', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'who', 'exceptional', 'math', 'who', 'memorized', 'incredibly', 'long', 'number', 'somehow', 'important', 'three', 'parties', 'Luke', 'Wright', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'former', 'cop', 'cage', 'fighter', 'who', 'lost', 'everything', 'steps', 'help', 'Mei', 'when', 'saved', 'brink', 'death', 'Russian', 'Chinese', 'stereotype', 'can', 'think', 'be', 'crammed', 'characters', 'Seeing', 'James', 'Hong', 'Blade', 'Runner', 'Big', 'Trouble', 'Little', 'China', 'Chris', 'Sarandon', 'Fright', 'Night', 'Princess', 'Bride', 'enter', 'picture', 'brought', 'hope', 'film', 'actually', 'being', 'decent', 'did', ""n't"", 'last.While', 'most', 'characters', 'were', 'very', 'one-dimensional', 'what', 'will', 'perhaps', 'get', 'most', 'way', 'movie', 'constantly', 'big', 'fight', 'sequence', 'front', 'pulling', 'away', 'right', 'actually', 'Just', 'look', 'everything', 'involving', 'Luke', 'place', 'subway', 'station', 'cage', 'fight', 'only', 'end', 'result', 'being', 'knees', 'front', 'Russian', 'mob', 'camera', 'slowly', 'out', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'taking', 'turns', 'beating', 'tar', ""'re"", 'constantly', 'wondering', 'when', 'Luke', 'finally', 'going', 'stand', 'up', 'himself.Everything', 'not', 'bad', 'Many', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'worthwhile', 'subway', 'scene', 'when', 'things', 'finally', 'pick', 'up', 'then', 'car', 'chase', 'Statham', 'tapping', 'Transporter', 'Italian', 'Job', 'roots', 'entire', 'hotel', 'sequence', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'capable', 'delivering', 'amazing', 'fight', 'scenes', 'just', 'shame', 'constantly', 'be', 'part', 'movies', 'are', 'poorly', 'written', 'many', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'nearly', 'ruined', 'terrible', 'camera', 'work', 'shaky', 'perspective', 'constant', 'whirring', 'movements', 'do', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'add', 'anything', 'nausea', 'movie', 'this.Safe', 'combination', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'movie', 'could', 'possibly', 'think', 'horrible', 'movie', 'Contraband', 'earlier', 'year', 'exact', 'same', 'character', ""'ve"", 'come', 'expect', 'even', 'set', 'world', 'record', 'movie', 'mostly', 'very', 'predictable', 'clich', 'eacute', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'characters', 'are', 'overly', 'stereotypical', 'movie', 'downright', 'awful', 'halfway', 'point', 'where', 'shy', 'boy', 'first', 'homecoming', 'dance', 'still', 'going', 'final', 'stages', 'puberty', 'learning', 'how', 'dance', 'girl', 'always', 'had', 'crush', 'better', 'night', 'was', 'so', 'bad', 'first', 'half', 'night', 'can', 'never', 'really', 'make', 'up', 'one', 'surprising', 'thing', 'ending', 'also', 'just', 'teasing', 'audience', 'trait', 'movie', 'do', 'least', 'half', 'dozen', 'times', 'have', 'seen', 'movie', 'Heck', 'probably', 'even', 'own', 'Why', 'world', 'would', 'willingly', 'pay', 'see', 'something', ""'ve"", 'already', 'seen', 'several', 'times']",N/A

They require a script with some backbone, and that means a strong villain, some solid supporting players, a dashing but tarnished hero, and plenty of excellent stunt work.  The stakes should be easily identifiable by the audience, and all of the players need to be uniquely fit into their respective roles.  In other words, a bad guy without a clear and understandable goal can muck it all up in a real hurry, and that gets to the core of what could've used more attention in SAFE, a serviceable cop thriller featuring the ever-reliable Jason Statham, the next true action star.(Note: the following review may contain minor spoilers solely for the discussion of character and plot.  If you prefer your reviews spoiler-free, then skip down to the last two paragraphs.  Otherwise, you've been warned.)Luke Wright (played by Statham) is a former NYC detective.  Disgraced by a sting gone bad and forced to live his life day-to-day, Wright stumbles across across Mei, a young Chinese math prodigy on the run from the Russian mob.  Realizing she's in danger, he does what he does best and rescues her, only to find out that now he's crossed paths with some dirty cops and a deadly Chinese Triad who'll stop at nothing to either have what the young girl knows or see her and those defending her dead.SAFE is far from the perfect vehicle for Statham, but it's real close.  The down-on-his-luck-but-itching-for-a-comeback wannabe fits perfectly with his charisma and skill as an acting professional.  Plus, he knows more than a thing or two about handling himself in close hand-to-hand combat or at a distance with guns blazing.  Whether he knows it or not, his is an effortless grace; the machismo he brings to his slate of pictures fuels his fan base, so it isn't genius casting him in the role of disgraced New York detective - it's just good business sense.What isn't so safe about SAFE is the story, which I found to be more than a bit muddled.  The opening ten minutes (or so) of the picture is told via a small handful of flashbacks and flash-forwards to present day, and they involve Wright and Mei (Catherine Chan).  These weren't necessarily confusing, but they contained important time details that required close attention.  (For my tastes, Mei's flashbacks scenes weren't necessary and could've been handled in dialogue.)  What does get confusing is that, as the story unfolds, the audience is delivered even more historical information about Wright, and this is given in dialogue.  The crux of this is that we find out a vast additional array of info surrounding Wright's role in the city; to complicate it more, supplementary character relationships are even defined further ... and, yes, the end result is that I found it all hard to follow.  These things are best when established visually not with passing dialogue; it's a small point, but one definitely worth mentioning.Also, there's been an increasingly alarming trend with directors involving fight sequences.  I'd first noted this with Christopher Nolan's work in BATMAN BEGINS, where I (and others) found some of the fisticuffs photographed so closely that it was hard to discern exactly what was happening.  There was no definitive answer of who was hitting whom.  Granted, we're led to believe that the hero is trouncing the bad guys, but we're never shown a clear angle until after the fight is over.  Then, we see that the baddies are lying on the ground unconscious.  Where this whole idea originated I can't say for sure, but I'd love to see it leave films entirely.  Sadly, a few fight sequences of SAFE fall into this narrative trap.  Is writer/director Boaz Yakin hoping to garner acclaim from other directors who've done likewise, or does he just not care to show audiences what exactly happened in that last fight?  I've no way to know, and that's never a good thing.I don't want all of this to sound as if I disliked SAFE.  Much of it was entertaining, if not downright exhilarating.  It looked and sounded like a great meal ... but, come the end, there were enough little nitpicks I would've changed to make it a meal I couldn't live without, which is something I think rising star Statham genuinely and legitimately deserves at this point in his career.  This one was good - very solid - but it could've used a bit more spit polish to be memorable.SAFE is produced by Lionsgate and IM Global in association with Automatik and Trigger Street Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Lionsgate.  Technically, the disc looks and sounds pretty terrific, though I thought Statham on a few occasions could've been miked better (difficult to understand).  The disc is rounded out with a few special features on crime and the art of the gunplay as well as a commentary track from Yakin himself.RECOMMENDED definitely for fans of Jason Statham because I don't believe he's yet let his true fans down.  SAFE was more than a bit confusing in the story department - there's a police cover-up, a massive back-story for Statham's Luke Wright reduced to a couple of throwaway lines, and some Chinese/Russian gang wars - and I can't help but wonder if writer/director Yakin was too enamored with his own script or too inexperienced a director to handle all of the nuances required here.  Thankfully, what matters most is a fallen hero with a heart of gold - this is the kind of stuff Bruce Willis has been banking for years - and the film works effectively on that level.

It's simply fun, fast, popcorn-munching Saturday night entertainment. Don't think about it too hard, and enjoy it for what it is- action. The director deserves to be commended for the breakneck pace he embraced, as well as some unique shots (hard to do in this played out genre), such as depicting gun battles in the reflections of side-view mirrors (it sounds weird, but he makes it work- damned good job).There is also a pretty quality ""surprise"" ending to this story...

1440999,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00542PSY2,Grady Harp,"[1, 1]","For those who appreciate the quality of action films with which Jason Statham is associated, SAFE will satisfy.  This film is more about high body count killings than most of his films, but it also is a film that allows Statham to explore a vulnerable side - and that is a move he does very well.  Written and directed by Boaz Yakin it is bent on pure gory entertainment, so if that is your bag, sit back and enjoy.The first third of the film can be a bit confusing as it jumps around in place (China, yesteryear New York and present time New York) - all to establish the identities of the many characters in the film. We meet Luke Wright (Jason Statham), an ex-cop who has become a down and out cage fighter whose wife was killed by the Russian mafia. He wanders the streets of New York, taking shelter in the homeless shelters, and has no real reason to live - until he meets an eleven- year-old Chinese girl Mei (Catherine Chan) whose parents were killed in China: Mei has an extraordinary mathematical mind and can remember complex numbers and so was sent with her `new dad' (Reggie Lee) to New York by the Triad Chinese mafia lead by the gruesomely cruel leader Han Jiao (James Hong) to find a set of numbers that will lead to the access of a vast amount of money also sought by the Russian mafia headed by Emile Docheski (S&aacute;ndor T&eacute;csy) and his vicious son (Joseph Sikora). Mei's memory and numerology leads her to discover the numbers are a safe combination - and that is when the action gets hot. To make matters even more complex the corrupt mayor (Chris Sarandon) and corrupt cops (Robert John Burke et al) make up the full regiment of ruthless men who are out to capture Mei as protected only by Luke: Luke has regained his owl prowess of being a deadly fighter in response to his valuing the life of Mei.  The rest is all action - non-stop.The film is fast-paced by director Boaz and the cinematography by Stefan Czapsky is top rank.  For pure action flicks this is a film that is hard to beat.  And in the long run it is the kind of film that Jason Statham has down pat.

1441007,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B00542PSY2,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[2, 7]","I'm a fan of Jason Statham. When given opportunity, he's unleashed fair acting chops (check out REVOLVER, THE BANK JOB, or LOCK, STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS). And when it pertains to matters kickassy, he has established a dynamic, brawny presence on the silver screen. Jason Statham fills a niche. It's the same niche that used to be filled by folks like Seagal and Van Damme, except that Statham is more comfortable delivering his lines. Balding dude's acting range extends beyond from A to B.And having propped Statham up, here now's the kick to the curb. A glance at Statham's film resume will inform you that, mostly, his pictures tend to fall on the generic side. Give him credit, he found his niche - the B-movie action flick - and he wallows in it. SAFE is more of the same ol', same ol'. Except that it doesn't boast the manic energy and audacity of the CRANK films or the Frenchified cool vibe of the TRANSPORTER franchise. However, take comfort in that SAFE isn't as godawful as IN THE NAME OF THE KING.Walking out of the theater, I wasn't thinking about SAFE as much as I was marveling over Bruce Willis' being featured in back-to-back-to-back trailers (LOOPERS, THE COLD LIGHT OF DAY, and THE EXPENDABLES 2). That pretty much sums up the impact that SAFE had on me. Which sucks, because I had been anticipating this movie (as mentioned, I'm a fan of Jason Statham). But there's a dreariness to this film, and a laziness and a desensitized approach to action filmmaking. And since I can't help but regard every new action flick now thru the prism of my jaw-dropped reaction to THE RAID: REDEMPTION, SAFE, even in its most heated moments, comes off as rather pedestrian.Today Luke Wright (Statham) wanders the streets of Manhattan, this haunted homeless vagabond. We learn, thru the course of the film, that Luke was considered ""New York's hardest cop once upon a time"" until he ratted out his fellow badges, never mind that they were corrupt. Today Luke Wright's past doesn't match the actuality of it. Word on the street suggests that Luke used to be employed in city sanitation, so thoroughly, I guess, had he been expunged off the police records.Some time ago Wright dabbled in low-tiered cage fighting, serving as punching bag for his opponents until he inadvertently put a YouTube sensation in a coma with one punch. Since Wright was supposed to have taken a dive in this match, the Russian mafia, which had placed a sizable bet against him, was rather unimpressed, to the extent that a brutal example was made out of Wright. Nowadays, Luke Wright wanders Manhattan, a suicidal ghost, reluctant to make human contact. The Russian mafia suffers him to live but has vowed to kill off anyone he grows close to. Maybe the most satisfying primal moment arrives when Wright at last begins to fight back, and one bruised mob lieutenant stares at him in disbelief: ""You?!... The garbage collector?!""The impetus is this little girl named Mei (newcomer Catherine Chan), a 12-year-old Chinese math prodigy. So impressive is her photographic recall that thugs from the Chinese triads abduct her and compel her to keep the boss' accounting books in her head, thus doing away with them incriminating paper trails. The plot gets properly underway when Mei is given a long string of coded numbers to memorize, the secret of which is so combustible that the streets of New York promptly explode in a three-way war amongst the Chinese triads, the Russian mafia, and them dirty cops, all parties frantically trying to nab the girl and the code. And Luke Wright, so miserable he contemplates ending it all, happens to trade glances with a fleeing Mei. He springs to her rescue.Jason Statham demonstrates his typical burly grace as he mows down scads of goons. But there's less martial arts mayhem than I anticipated. This is more like in them good old Charles Bronson days. Statham seems as content with applying firearms as with them fists. I guess it's more realistic. Why get in close when you can prudently dispose of your target from distance? But I miss Statham throwing down, TRANSPORTER style.2.5 out of 5 stars for SAFE, destined to be consigned to strictly rental territory. The plot eventually degenerates into a series of violent exchanges and revelations that are eye-rolling. The film's McGuffin - that string of coded numbers - is intriguing until it's deciphered, and then it's just a cheap letdown. I wish Statham had more chemistry with the young girl. Those were the money moments, emotionally, but I wasn't feelin' it. It's probably hard to make a connection when dude keeps blowing people's heads off in front of the little girl. Mei is an interesting character whose potential could've been more explored. Besides her natural aptitude for dizzying mathematics, she's savvy enough to get a feel for how ""business"" works in crime organizations. She knew when to make a run for it. I should've made a run for it. But I stuck it out in the theater. I am a Jason Statham fan. Sometimes it's rough.",3,"""I never know what to say in these moments...

In it, the good guy has to protect an autistic boy who is a savant with patterns, puzzles and codes. The boy inadvertently figures out an encrypted message and the chase is on. I remember it being a good flick, with a really intense scene which takes place in a crowded elevator.Replace the autistic boy with a girl genius. Replace Bruce Willis with Jason Statham. Add a 3-way power struggle between the Russian mob, the Chinese mob and a corrupt police force. Season with some extra thumping time for Statham, and there's Safe in a nutshell.Mei has a photographic memory, and is better than a computer when it comes to crunching numbers, which is why the Chinese mob kidnaps her. Seems they need to figure out a safe combination in the Big Apple (actually, that's just half of what they need). As if the mob's manipulation of her and threats against her weren't enough to put you in her corner, she's also savvy, tough and streetwise--in addition to being an adorable little girl.Statham was a tough, clean cop--ostracized because he wouldn't play ball with his crooked co-workers. He gets it from all sides. After his wife is murdered, he has little to live for and is contemplating suicide when fate brings Mei (trying to escape the bad guys) across his path.A snap decision is made and he is now her protector. What ensues is a white-knuckle thrill ride that left me feeling good about the time invested to watch it.By comparing it toMercury RisingI didn't intend to imply Safe was formulaic.

His worthless existence is saved by a little girl fleeing the Chinese and Russian mobs. The girl, Mei, has a remarkable photographic memory and a Chinese gang warlord doesn't trust the trail computers leave. He learns about Mei and she becomes his unwilling accomplice. She experiences brutal murders and learns it is just business. Luke Wright (Statham) is her salvation.Catherine Chan is wonderful as Mei and she lights up the screen with her presence--a young girl dragged from her life in China to the seedy word of crime in New York. When she escapes, the Chinese gang wants her back and the Russian gang wants the information stored in her head. The New York police detectives are corrupt as is the mayor. There seems to be no one decent in New York City.SAGE is full of extremem violence. Wright might be a good man but he does not hesitate to kill when necessary.

She can memorize numbers, no matter how long the sequence. And when she's given one exceptionally long sequence of seemingly random numbers that she instantly memorizes, she becomes a priceless commodity that's also a problem for all 3 corrupt factions (willing to kill each other and her to keep the number a secret), and her only hope is a cage fighter with nothing left to lose when his wife's killed, he loses his career, and is a sought-after criminal with a vague past.Right as he's ready to end it all, things change as Mei enters his life, now he protects hers.And, as is a standard Statham-focused film, it's a one-man army versus multiple armies.As is also a standard Statham trope, he tries (at times a little too hard) to be a broken hero, though the script makes it a bit hard for him to be appropriately broken. Not to mention his name, Luke Wright, fits in his film name resume- downright corny/awkward.Problem is, for the fight scenes he's become known for, this one lacks some of the creativity of his past films. Yeah, a touch of creativity here and there, but nothing tremendously spectacular that would fill me with excitement like a Tony Jaa or a Jet Li film. Half the time, for example, he seems more at home using a firearm than his fists.Also, his snide wise-cracking has seen better films, making his broken-hero progress that much more stilted. Halfway through the movie, with Mei having an absence of screen time, it goes from a somewhat creative martial arts film to feeling pretty much Hollywood standard. So it seems that Mei creates a nice presence whenever she's around (and not just for her snide attitude and crafty childishness, perfect for her role). As much as I didn't care for Crank and its sequel, I feel they were a bit better than this in some ways.Yeah, a couple story twists here and there along with twisted bones, but nothing truly memorable besides the ending twist for one of the Chinese mafia. Besides that, I couldn't readily recommend this to someone looking for a thoroughly creative, believable action film. If you want a real good Statham film, I'd suggest the Expendables movies.",3,"Not quite safe, personally speaking",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2425,"['easy', 'speak', 'up', 'plot', 'holes', 'whatnot', 'figure', ""'ll"", 'let', 'know', 'bit', 'premise.There', '11-year-old', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'Mei', 'who', 'math', 'yet', 'ability', 'spark', 'turf', 'war', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'mafias', 'corrupt', 'cops', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'can', 'memorize', 'numbers', 'matter', 'how', 'long', 'sequence', 'when', 'given', 'one', 'exceptionally', 'long', 'sequence', 'seemingly', 'random', 'numbers', 'instantly', 'priceless', 'commodity', 'also', 'problem', '3', 'corrupt', 'factions', 'willing', 'kill', 'other', 'keep', 'number', 'secret', 'only', 'hope', 'cage', 'fighter', 'nothing', 'left', 'lose', 'when', 'wife', 'killed', 'career', 'sought-after', 'criminal', 'vague', 'past.Right', 'ready', 'end', 'things', 'change', 'Mei', 'life', 'now', 'hers.And', 'standard', 'Statham-focused', 'film', 'one-man', 'army', 'versus', 'multiple', 'armies.As', 'also', 'standard', 'Statham', 'trope', 'times', 'little', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'broken', 'hero', 'script', 'bit', 'hard', 'be', 'appropriately', 'broken', 'Not', 'mention', 'name', 'Luke', 'Wright', 'film', 'name', 'resume-', 'downright', 'corny/awkward.Problem', 'fight', 'become', 'known', 'one', 'creativity', 'past', 'films', 'Yeah', 'touch', 'creativity', 'here', 'there', 'nothing', 'tremendously', 'spectacular', 'would', 'fill', 'excitement', 'Tony', 'Jaa', 'Jet', 'Li', 'film', 'time', 'example', 'more', 'home', 'using', 'firearm', 'fists.Also', 'snide', 'wise-cracking', 'seen', 'better', 'films', 'making', 'broken-hero', 'progress', 'much', 'more', 'stilted', 'Halfway', 'movie', 'Mei', 'having', 'absence', 'screen', 'time', 'somewhat', 'creative', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'feeling', 'pretty', 'much', 'Hollywood', 'standard', 'Mei', 'nice', 'presence', 'whenever', 'around', 'not', 'just', 'snide', 'attitude', 'crafty', 'childishness', 'perfect', 'role', 'As', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'Crank', 'sequel', 'feel', 'were', 'bit', 'better', 'ways.Yeah', 'couple', 'story', 'twists', 'here', 'there', 'along', 'twisted', 'bones', 'nothing', 'truly', 'memorable', 'ending', 'twist', 'one', 'Chinese', 'mafia', 'could', ""n't"", 'readily', 'recommend', 'someone', 'looking', 'thoroughly', 'creative', 'believable', 'action', 'film', 'want', 'real', 'good', 'Statham', 'film', ""'d"", 'suggest', 'Expendables', 'movies']",N/A

An eleven-year-old Chinese girl knows a secret numerical code, which means EVERYONE wants her. Someone has to keep her safe from the New York City Police Department, a Chinese tong and the Russian mob. Our hero, a former undercover cop, doesn't even know her, he was planning to commit suicide when he spotted her in a subway station trying to elude pursuers.Written and directed by Boaz Yakin, who is all over the map with projects from the ridiculous to the sublime (""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" and ""Remember the Titans""), this one is mindless and hyper-kinetic. There is so much deadly gunfire it became boring, but some of the actors piqued our interest:* Jason Statham rules action movies! Between ""Transporter"" and ""Crank"" he practically invented his style of super-deadly, super-violent martial arts. Not bad for a former model.* Catherine Chan, in her screen debut, sounds convincingly smart (she plays a genius) and speaks Chinese like a trouper!* Chris Sarandon (""Fright Night"" 2011 and 1985), this guy still looks good. In this one he's the Mayor with an elegant penthouse and long-range plans to keep it. He knows things that most people don't even know they don't know.* Anson Mount (""Straw Dogs"") is someone to watch! He's gorgeous when he has a shave and a haircut. His head-shot is skuzzy, but here.... Yum! He's a henchman in this one...* James Hong (""Junk"" and lots of TV) is a Minneapolis-born character actor. This time he's the Godfather of the Chinese tong.* Reggie Lee (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is another familiar Asian face. In this one, he's the guy who pretends to care for the little girl to gain her trust.And we haven't even touched on the actors in the Russian mob or the NYPD!Suffice it to say, this R-rated actioner has non-stop gunfire, ridiculous vehicular mayhem, cartoony fisticuffs and countless pursuits. There was very little profanity and no nudity, but deaths by the score, all of which required suspension of disbelief. ...it's a guy thing...Near the end, mention is made of someone moving to Seattle, where you will find ""trees and stuff"" (he didn't say ""stuff"").

All of the ingredients are here: good actors, high production values, action and stunts, but all are hamstrung by a silly plot. Can we say stupid at this point? I think we all know what we want/expect to see  -  and what we saw was good - bur really as the credits rolled we tried to figure out what just happened and why all of the characters did what they did and now how the entire movie (shot just slightly of sequence) made sense. Editing- sound included. A good movie is in here - but it hasn't been spliced together yet. What you have is representative of the trailer. If you need a Statham fix, it's OK. Certainly not bad. Really not boring. I like the stylistic elements and there were some good character actors, but yeah, even when we expect a silly plot there has to be something to hold it all together in a believe-able way.

The good ones have all the action you want, some kind of decent plot and usually great cinematography. This movie: not so much.I guess I'm harder to please than Stratham's other fans who claim if you like him, you'll like the movie. The script is hackneyed and ineloquent. The plot ... hmm... I'm being generous here. Even a child could have come up with this simpleton storyline. Good guy angers bad guys. Bad guys threaten to kill him and anyone he befriends. 1st casualty - sleeping neighbor in a homeless shelter. Enter girl in distress ... I can just picture one of those silent films where a curly blonde screams with fright ... this time it's a child. Oh, boy, now that's different!In the end, most of the bad guys die and the good guy and his new best friend live happily ever after.There's a lot of action, a lot of blood and guts, a lot of shooting and a couple of expected car chases. Personally, the entire film, including the action sequences, look like they were shot by an amateur under the auspices of a director wannabe. I didn't like any of it.Would I have seen the movie if I read this review first? NO!p.s.

It also features perhaps the most tightly choreographed gun battle ever shot on film. In fact, I'd say John Woo could learn from this one. (Less slo-mo casings in the air!)Woo clearly inspired much of the cutting and feel here but Statham more vitally brings his by now truly classic grim action hero style at its best and lifts the proceedings a notch at every turn. Add to that excellent camera movement, a nice simple script without much filler, and one crisis/shootout after another, and this is almost Crank-level excitement.The violence is so over the top that it's comic book, which is good as you haven't seen this many bad guys shot since your last zombie flick. The colors and sets are Chinatown brilliant, which looks wonderful on this excellent blu-ray transfer, and the characters menacing and leering in equal doses. James Hong is as entertaining as ever, btw; quite a career he's had.All in all, Safe delivers plenty of intensity from start to stop, and if you want a basic shoot-'em-up done to perfection, this is your movie. There's also a few decent extras on the BD, including a solid making-of.Statham is well on his way to being the realest action hero the screen has ever seen; he seems to get better every flick at martial arts and live stunts and just generally being bad-ass and likable all at once.

1441097,AIY4H4KWR2KWZ,B00542PSY2,MadMacs,"[6, 6]","Not a typical action flick because, remarkably, there's also a fully-conceived narrative being told; a sublime study of character that I normally associate with more cerebral productions.Tells the story of Luke Wright, former cop who turned in a bunch of dirty cops on the take - his buddies. Having been excised from the fraternal order as part of the pyrrhic bargain, he drifted, finally finding work as journeyman cage fighter. It's not a great life, but it's one that he finds honor in living. Along with his wife, he's doing okay. Until he accidentally puts out the light of a glass-jawed opponent. An opponent who was 'supposed' to win.With so much money on the line, the muckers who arrange such things are understandably pissed. Worse, those weren't the heaviest hitters who wagered on the rigged match. The Russian Mafia isn't known for losing money with grace. The penalty for his inadvertent win - murdering his wife. And in true twisted fashion, they leave him breathing. It's explained that he's on their forever-crap list, they'll be watching him for the rest of his life. If he makes any connection, anything other than the most casual of contact with another human being, they're going to murder that person too. Luke is branded a loner now and for as long as his heart continues its miserable beat. This isn't life - it's existence.His own death would be a release. That's the sick mentality of the ultimate mob punishment - you're forced to go on while everything you care about, or even hope to care about, is utterly ground underfoot.On the other side of the world, a young math prodigy has been discovered. Unfortunately for her that immense talent has been identified by one of the Chinese Triads; organized crime families who have been a part of that culture longer than many countries in the world have existed. One mob boss detests computers and the inherent security flaws that they leave open, so he has decided he will have the young girl as his own private human calculator. Transportable, malleable and completely coercible - young Mai is now a slave to the gangsters. And just like Luke, is no longer living, but simply existing.Fate brings these two together, each discovering that suffering on the run is preferable to the day-to-day hell living apart. As the pair fight off the gathering dark forces of dirty cops, rotten government and brutal gangsters - the odd team determine that they will be free, one way or another.Adrenaline pumping rush of a movie with Jason Statham once again dominating the action landscape. There is no other performer in his weight class - movie star heavyweight. The really scary part is that he seems to be hitting his stride. Can you imagine what the next five, maybe ten years will bring?Young actress Catherine Chan, as Mei, happily surprised. It's rare to find an actress of that age who can actually act. Despite the plethora of wannabe child performers who are annoyingly pretentious and frighteningly older than than their chronological age - very few can believably act; to become the person of the role and transmit the essence of the character through to us, the audience. Again, props to Director Boaz Yakin for his insight in selecting her. The man has a new fan.As an aside, absolutely loved that Yakin did not open the film with the tiresome checklist of names and too-clever CGI visual titles. Cutting to the chase, we're instantly thrown into the nightmare of Luke and Mai's existence. Truly enjoy it when a filmmaker steps outside the box without crushing it. Out-bleeping-standing. Thank you.One of the better roles Statham has executed. And given the repertoire of films already under his cinched six-pack fitted belt, I'm already looking forward to more.No question a solid four+ stars.

1441100,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B00542PSY2,Mantis,"[1, 1]","As a crusty old veteran of viewing action flicks, mostly of the martial arts variety, I've learned to wait for a decent flick to reveal itself to me.  If it's worth anything, I'll hear about it.  Otherwise I'll find myself sitting through absolute junk like ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li"" (2009) or the latest wire-fu war epic from Hong Kong with a cast of just over seven thousand.  I like things simple and well done.  Safe is a flick that's more ambitious than I would've expected but much more enjoyable, too.  Not only was this one of the better American action flicks I've seen in the last few years, it's easily become my favorite film of leading man Jason Statham (Crank).Statham plays an ex NYC cop whose life has been turned upside-down by Russian mobsters after he fails to throw a cage fight.  He ends up homeless & depressed, then harassed by his old, crooked friends at the department.  Meanwhile, a young female math genius named Mei (Catherine Chan) is kidnapped in China by Triads and forced to run numbers pertaining to their accounts and businesses in the states.  After being given a really, really long number to memorize, she is kidnapped by the Russian gangsters.  When the li'l accountant goes AWOL, the cops play ""Yojimbo"" with the Russians and the Triads, offering assistance to the highest bidder.I would not call this a martial arts film but the fights are about as close as you can get without doing so.  This film was advertised with a heavy emphasis on a cage-fighting element that barely exists, so slacking in the action department would have brought about an enormous amount of written wrath (see my review of Transporter 3).  Luckily the action is done by Chad Stahelski (Expendables 2) and J.J. ""Loco"" Perry (Undisputed 2) and, in my opinion, does not disappoint.  There aren't a ton of traditional fisticuffs but I enjoyed what's here and there's plenty more action in other areas that's exciting and well done, including some cool camera and stuntwork.Okay, as much as I liked this, it's got some drawbacks.  Well, okay, mostly that it's pretty silly.  Statham has had some decent scripts to work with recently (e.g. The Killer Elite) but this ain't one of 'em.  The Seagalian way that Statham's skills are gradually revealed is firm B-movie territory.  Also, I find it a bit irresponsible for a movie this violent (oh, and it is) to have most of the carnage take place right in front of an 11-year-old girl.  Eh, maybe I'm just getting old.  Also, one of the Russian mobsters is played by the cooler-than-everyone Igor Jijikine (Driven to Kill) and he's not in it nearly enough.  Reggie Lee (The Dark Knight Rises), as Mei's adoptive father, is tender & despicable, and also worth noting.This was a rental and I forgot to write down any specifics, and for that, I apologize.  I liked this enough to justify purchase and will amend this at a later date.  I know there's a ""making of "" documentary but that's all I can recall.  Either way it's pretty cool.  Unless you can't stand Statham or have to have a plot that's not absurd this comes highly recommended.  This is the 2nd film in-a-row from last year that I've reviewed to feature Russian gangsters and a former Robocop as a bad guy.

I can't deny the efforts of Stallone to bring the action genre back with his newest movies like the Expendables 2 , but for now, Statham is on top.so in short, out of all those B grade action films out there, its nice to see a very well crafted action packed movie that is pure entertainment, thank you Statham !!highly recommended !!4.5 out of 5[...]",5,"Well crafted Action film with Jason Statham, not to be missed",1346803200,"09 5, 2012",2012,2384,"['Well', 'be', 'said', 'action', 'genre', 'not', 'been', 'up', 'standards', 'lately', 'action', 'era', 'ended', 'end', '90s', 'Statham', 'showed', 'up', 'movie', 'one', 'better', 'entertaining', 'action', 'movies', 'recent', 'years', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'part', 'took', 'back', 'Die', 'Hard', '90s', 'years', 'when', 'action', 'films', 'were', 'top.Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'not', 'perfect', 'film', 'Oscar', 'nominated', 'movie', 'truly', 'deliver', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'enjoyable', 'movie', 'experience.the', 'movie', 'somewhat', 'similar', '1998Mercury', 'Risingstarring', 'one', 'only', 'Bruce', 'Willis', 'only', 'Safe', 'was', 'more', 'brutal', 'much', 'more', 'action', 'packed', 'sorry', 'Bruceit', 'broken', 'fallen', 'ex-cop', 'Luke', 'Wright', 'Statham', 'who', 'lost', 'almost', 'everything', 'life', 'who', 'hit', 'rock', 'bottom', 'once', 'path', 'crossed', 'young', 'helpless', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'Mei', 'who', 'being', 'hunted', 'scum', 'bag', 'corrupt', 'cop', 'NYC', 'possession', 'safe', 'code', 'inner', 'fighter', 'Luke', 'up', 'now', 'new', 'goal', 'life', 'protect', 'Mei', 'bring', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'plot', 'something', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'would', 'usually', 'do', 'thankfully', 'role', 'fell', 'Statham', 'who', 'really', 'made', 'difference', 'here', 'like', 'Jackie', 'Chan', 'come', 'not', 'brutal', 'enough', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'script', 'simple', 'plot', 'very', 'fast', 'paced', 'not', 'mention', 'action', 'packed', 'Statham', 'really', 'muscles', 'here', 'lots', 'well', 'choreographed', 'fighting', 'sequences', 'fantastic', 'shoot', 'scenes', 'one', 'place', 'night', 'club', 'was', 'adrenaline', 'pumping', 'action', 'was', 'brutal.I', 'also', 'liked', 'how', 'gathered', 'good', 'actors', 'playing', 'villains', 'bad', 'guys', 'characters', 'ranging', 'Russian', 'mobsters', 'Chinese', 'gangsters', 'even', 'corrupt', 'Cops.I', 'strongly', 'believe', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'emerged', 'new', 'action', 'star', 'new', 'millennium', 'what', 'Van', 'Damme', 'Scwharezzenger', 'Stallone', 'were', '90s', 'what', 'be', 'ultimate', 'action', 'star', 'acting', 'pretty', 'good', 'too', 'ca', ""n't"", 'deny', 'efforts', 'Stallone', 'bring', 'action', 'back', 'newest', 'movies', 'Expendables', '2', 'now', 'Statham', 'top.so', 'short', 'B', 'grade', 'action', 'films', 'there', 'nice', 'see', 'very', 'well', 'crafted', 'action', 'packed', 'movie', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'thank', 'Statham', 'highly', 'recommended', '4.5', '5', '[', ']']",N/A

1441125,A3QLAOOTFEHCJI,B00542PSY2,M. Oleson,"[1, 2]","Jason Statham does what he does best, kick ass.  While he does it very effectively here, the film is long on stunts and short of everything else.  He plays Luke Wright, a former super-secret cop of some kind who leaves the NYC force after informing on dirty cops.  He makes a living throwing ultimate fighter matches at the discretion of Russian mob bosses.  In his last fight he seriously injures a fighter after throwing only one punch and wins the match.  The mob isn't happy, so they kill his wife and maybe his daughter (off screen) and promise to kill anyone else he gets close to.  So off he goes into the back alleys of New York.While all this is happening there is a young Chinese girl (Catherine Chan) who is pulled out of school because she has a great memory and an advanced knowledge of mathematics.  The Chinese mob sends her to NYC with a memorized set of numbers that match a combination to a couple safes.This all involves both the Chinese and Russian mobs (how convenient) but the real lynch pins are the corrupt police and mayor.  While ridiculous, this early set up is the only thing interesting about the movie.  Luke rescues Mei (Chan) from the Russians and the majority of the film consists of Luke playing keep away with both mobs and the cops, all of whom want the girl and the memorized combinations.  Luke kills plenty of bad guys along the way with guns, knives, kitchen appliances and anything else that is handy.  Toss in a few rote car chases and it all adds up to a conventional and predictable action flick.The Blu ray version of this film is really excellent.  The 1080p transfer comes with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The clarity is top rate.  Colors (lot of blue) are vibrant and the blacks are black.  The real headliner here, however is the great DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 audio track.  If your home theater is set up to handle this lossless mix you will be rewarded nicely.  All the small sounds, the whooshing sounds of a subway and the gun battles are all well placed.  Extras include a director's commentary, and 3 short documentaries on how and why the film was made.",3,2 1/2 stars for a familiar Jason Statham flick,1351123200,"10 25, 2012",2012,2104,"['Jason', 'Statham', 'what', 'best', 'kick', 'ass', 'very', 'effectively', 'here', 'film', 'long', 'stunts', 'short', 'everything', 'else', 'Luke', 'Wright', 'former', 'super-secret', 'cop', 'kind', 'who', 'NYC', 'force', 'informing', 'dirty', 'cops', 'living', 'throwing', 'ultimate', 'fighter', 'matches', 'discretion', 'Russian', 'mob', 'bosses', 'last', 'fight', 'seriously', 'fighter', 'throwing', 'only', 'one', 'punch', 'match', 'mob', ""n't"", 'happy', 'kill', 'wife', 'maybe', 'daughter', 'screen', 'promise', 'kill', 'anyone', 'else', 'close', 'So', 'back', 'alleys', 'New', 'York.While', 'happening', 'young', 'Chinese', 'girl', 'Catherine', 'Chan', 'who', 'pulled', 'school', 'great', 'memory', 'advanced', 'knowledge', 'mathematics', 'Chinese', 'mob', 'NYC', 'memorized', 'set', 'numbers', 'match', 'combination', 'couple', 'safes.This', 'Chinese', 'Russian', 'mobs', 'how', 'convenient', 'real', 'lynch', 'pins', 'are', 'corrupt', 'police', 'mayor', 'ridiculous', 'early', 'set', 'up', 'only', 'thing', 'interesting', 'movie', 'Luke', 'Mei', 'Chan', 'Russians', 'majority', 'film', 'Luke', 'playing', 'keep', 'away', 'mobs', 'cops', 'whom', 'want', 'girl', 'memorized', 'combinations', 'Luke', 'plenty', 'bad', 'guys', 'way', 'guns', 'knives', 'kitchen', 'appliances', 'anything', 'else', 'handy', 'Toss', 'few', 'rote', 'car', 'chases', 'up', 'conventional', 'predictable', 'action', 'flick.The', 'Blu', 'ray', 'version', 'film', 'really', 'excellent', '1080p', 'transfer', '2.35:1', 'aspect', 'ratio', 'clarity', 'top', 'rate', 'Colors', 'lot', 'blue', 'are', 'vibrant', 'blacks', 'are', 'black', 'real', 'headliner', 'here', 'however', 'great', 'DTS-HD', 'Master', 'Audio', '7.1', 'audio', 'track', 'home', 'theater', 'set', 'up', 'handle', 'lossless', 'mix', 'will', 'be', 'rewarded', 'nicely', 'small', 'sounds', 'whooshing', 'sounds', 'subway', 'gun', 'battles', 'are', 'well', 'placed', 'Extras', 'include', 'director', 'commentary', '3', 'short', 'documentaries', 'how', 'why', 'film', 'was', 'made']",N/A

If you're in the mood for a loud, noisy, bloody, high-body-count film without any pretensions of being anything more than this...SAFE fits the bill admirably.  Jason Statham continues to perfect the art of kicking butt and looking good while doing it.  He's very far indeed from being a great actor (although he showed real acting chops with THE BANK JOB), but he's GREAT at applying a beat-down on a bad guy or just shooting a whole lot of people in a short period of time.In SAFE, Statham is a former cop who is now earning extra money doing MMA fighting.  When he wins a fight he was supposed to loose, the Russian mobsters who lost a lot of money betting against him take it out on his family.  He's cast adrift in the world and near to suicide.  But he notices a young Chinese girl in trouble, and his efforts to save her give him a reason to live again...and a reason to essentially destroy a) the Chinese mob, b) the Russian mob and c) many of NYC's most corrupt cops.  The body count in this film is massive...and the methods of death are varied.This Chinese girl is a math prodigy and she has been ""recruited"" by the mob to memorize complicated numbers...including one apparently VERY important number.  This method of tracking critical numbers lacks credibility, and frankly, most of the movie lacks logic.  The plot is exceedingly thin, so be sure to set your expectations accordingly.  This film is an adrenalin rush, not an intellectual stimulant.  People behave stupidly, bad guys have terrible aim and collateral damage is inflicted in huge quantities without the slightest notice.  Yes, SAFE is an insult to intelligence, but it's done with such blunt force (and excellent sound effects editing) that anyone looking for mindless, violent entertainment should enjoy it.The movie moves quickly and the action scenes are plentiful.  It's mostly set in New York City, and the cinematography and locations chosen provide an apt grittiness. It's not the wildly insane, over-the-top experience that Statham's CRANK movies are...but it has a recklessness in style and execution that suits the material well. Yes, it is technically competent trash.Thus, I liked it for what it was...and many others will too as long as they clearly understand what they're getting in to.

as Han Jiao.I recently reviewed Statham's most recent DVD release,as of this date,Parker,and after viewing that messy and disappointing effort,I thought I would re visit this one.It is like night and day.Unlike Parker,the film has everything you would expect in a Statham movie:fast moves,lots of action,good editing and decent directing.The story finds ex New York cop,Statham,now roaming the fights circuit.However instead of taking a dive in the second round,he delivers a punch of such fury that it leaves his opponent laid up in a hospital bed.Now the man who set up the fight and especially those who backed him,Russian mobsters,want revenge on him.Running parallel to this story is another concerning a young girl called Mei.She was taken out of her class in China for being a super wiz at math.She was taken to Beijing where she was hooked up with a mob boss there.He doesn`t like computers so he uses her mind to recall and repeat important figures concerning his business dealings.Eventually she ends up in New York working for his business there.Between $30 million and some revealing computer discs which could blow the dealings between the corrupt Chinese gangs and the NYC police wide open,the Russians  get wind of things and kidnap the girl.The Chinese inform the police who both go after the girl,while the Russians just want the money.When the cops knock on the door to the room where the girl is being interrogated,the girl manages to flee in the confusion.Meanwhile Statham`s wife has been killed by the Russians in retribution and he is wandering the streets in a terrible state.Desperate he ends up at the edge of a subway platform contemplating his end,when the Chinese girl passes his way,giving him a quick but knowing glance.Shaken out of his mind set he follows the girl to see the Russians following her.He manages to get on the train,foil the Russians attempts to get her,and spirits her away himself.In short order he manages to glean what it is the Chinese,Russians and police are after and vows to protect her.The mayor of NYC is informed of the goings on involving Statham and the girl.It is here that it is revealed that Statham used to be a `cleaner`of sorts,taking out undesirables in black ops in and around the city.When some fellow cops got greedy and corrupt that is when Statham drew the line and left it all behind.Statham becomes pro active and finds the $30 million,with the help of one of his ex corrupt cop buddies,and also gets one of the computer discs from the mayor.He sends the majority of the millions to the Chinese boss warning him if he ever should try to find the girl,that the discs would find their way into the right hands.Statham stays with the girl as her protector and friend,taking one day at a time.This movie is everything you would expect from Statham and it puts him right where we expect him to be;in the thick of the action and producing and taking plenty of it.This film is deftly directed by Boaz Yakin and the editing is great,as it moves fast just when it needs to.The action/stunts will sometimes take your breath away.Kudos to all involved here.It was nice to see Chinese acting veteran James Hong doing a great job as the Chinese mob boss.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include commentary and four featurettes.All in all a top notch entry by Jason Statham and crew.Nicely directed and with lots of action,this film is bound to please his fans and grab some new ones.4-4 1/2 stars.",4,Born and bred for Statham,1370044800,"06 1,

As it turns out, Mei is holding a secret in her head that the Chinese, Russians, and even the New York City Police are willing to kill for, so when she runs away all hell breaks loose. The story here is actually pretty solid and Jason Statham is once again terrific, playing a deep character with a great back story. Had this film expanded on the story and flashed back to the past, it may have been a lot better, but as it was, Safe quickly turns into to one big chase, with lots of bullets and bodies. Newcomer Catherine Chan plays Mei and she was horrible. This girl has been kidnapped and seen horrors that most of us couldn't even imagine, yet she's always stone faced. She is emotionless and clearly using a fake accent, making her performance dry and full of mumbled lines that do nothing but confuse the audience. Jason Statham gives his usual high energy performance, with amazing moves, and terrific one-liners, but without any support, in a film that goes from one chase to another, it really is just a wasted effort.",3,The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2014,1592,"[""'ve"", 'been', 'bit', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'kick', 'lately', 'now', 'know', 'how', 'fond', 'am', 'films', 'man', 'really', 'action', 'junkies', 'raving', 'film', 'better', 'last', 'even', 'hard', 'time', 'making', 'Safe', 'worth', 'watching', 'Former', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Police', 'Detective', 'Luke', 'Wright', 'Statham', 'lost', 'job', 'family', 'respect', 'down', 'luck', 'way', 'out', 'when', 'lost', 'Asian', 'girl', 'subway', 'girl', 'Mei', 'numbers', 'servant', 'China', 'who', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'forced', 'work', 'organized', 'crime', 'syndicate', 'out', 'Mei', 'holding', 'secret', 'head', 'Chinese', 'Russians', 'even', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'Police', 'are', 'willing', 'kill', 'so', 'when', 'away', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'story', 'here', 'actually', 'pretty', 'solid', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'once', 'again', 'terrific', 'playing', 'deep', 'character', 'great', 'back', 'story', 'Had', 'film', 'expanded', 'story', 'flashed', 'back', 'past', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'better', 'was', 'Safe', 'quickly', 'one', 'big', 'chase', 'lots', 'bullets', 'bodies', 'Newcomer', 'Catherine', 'Chan', 'Mei', 'was', 'horrible', 'girl', 'been', 'kidnapped', 'seen', 'horrors', 'most', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'imagine', 'always', 'stone', 'faced', 'emotionless', 'clearly', 'using', 'fake', 'accent', 'making', 'performance', 'dry', 'full', 'mumbled', 'lines', 'do', 'nothing', 'confuse', 'audience', 'Jason', 'Statham', 'usual', 'high', 'energy', 'performance', 'amazing', 'moves', 'terrific', 'one-liners', 'support', 'film', 'one', 'chase', 'really', 'just', 'wasted', 'effort']",N/A

The relationship between the characters seems unorthodox and distant, but it also has a certain attraction, which is at the heart of the film, which stars action hero Jason Statham (Death Race,War,Crank films).Catherine Chang is Mei, a young girl from China, who has an amazing ability to work with and remember numbers.  She has been kidnapped by Han Jiao (James Hong), a Chinese mob boss, sent to New York City, and forced to keep track of the accounts of his underworld activities.  Mei then becomes a pawn, in a turf war between the Russian mafia, the Chinese Triad, and some crooked NYC cops.The typically taciturn Statham, plays Luke Wright, a former cop, turned fighter, whose wife is murdered in retaliation by the Russian mafia, after he fails to take a dive.  Forced to live as a loner, Wright is at a train station, contemplating jumping in front of a train, when he spots Mei in danger.  After rescuing the terrified girl, and making a dramatic escape, Wright tries to lead her to safety, but matters quickly become more complicated, and violent.Playing off a young child, is a change of pace for the soft-spoken Brit, and things are a little awkward at times.  The premise of using a ""human computer"" is not exactly original, but still plays well enough, and the action scenes should satisfy most Statham fans.

Moments before you can carry out your plan, however, you see a young girl in need of your help. Do you go to her aid? If your answer is no, you just shortened this movie by about 98%.When we first meet Luke Wright (played by Jason Statham), he's won a mixed martial arts bout that the Russian mob ""encouraged"" him to lose. An easy enough task given the fact that he already had a losing record. After they assault him, he believes the worst is behind him. That proves to be false when he returns home to find members of the same Russian mob have killed his girlfriend (or wife, I'm not entirely sure and the information sources I've checked are silent on the matter). Rather than kill him, he's left as the prime suspect in the homicide and told to leave the mob's territory. On the other side of the world, a ten year-old Chinese student named Mei (played by Catherine Chan in her first feature film) demonstrates an exceptional gift for remembering numbers regardless of length or complexity. When the nature of her gift becomes common knowledge in her hometown, she becomes the ward of a local businessman with consent of her father whose hands are full thanks to her mother's serious illness. The businessman is a member of the Triads, Chinese organized crime for those who are unfamiliar, and intends to use her gift in America in lieu of written or computer files, as both can be seized by law enforcement. In time, they trust her unflinchingly and ask her to remember a very long number and relay it to the Russians who will give her another number to bring back. But when her escorts are shot en route to the Russians, she runs and they chase her. She makes it to the subway where a despondent Luke (Statham) subdues her pursuers and makes himself the one man in New York who the Triads, the Russians, and the NYPD officers on their payroll all want dead.Now, I like Jason Statham. While I don't own copies of any film in  either the Transporter series or the Crank series, I do own DVDs of The Mechanic and Death Race despite the fact that both films received generally negative reviews from the majority of critics.

Mei (Catherine Chan) is an 11-year-old Chinese girl with a perfect, photographic memory, who is brought to New York to work for a mobster Han Jiao (James Hong). Luke rescues the girl who has managed to escape, but they soon find themselves caught in the crossfire as the Chinese group clashes with the Russians. To make things worse, corrupt police officers also step in.Of course, Jason Statham does what he does, and he does it brilliantly as ever. The action is raw, violent and visceral. There are many shoot-outs and martial arts fights as well as a car chase. Jason Statham looks cool in black suits and delivers lines with his trademark voice, but obviously the filmmakers did not want to make a simple revenge action.In his attempt to add something new to the formulaic concept that has been employed in such films as ""Gloria"" and ""The Professional,"" writer / director Boaz Yakin (""Fresh"" ""Remember the Titans"") plays with the viewer's expectation of what will happen next. Will Statham's character, now beaten up, stand up again and fight back? Will the ""bad"" guys be punished? At some points the film just refuses to give us what we all expect. At the earlier scene of ""Safe"" Statham is required to play a man in utter despair, and he does it surprisingly well.The entire plotline is rather predictable and we know where the story is going.

1441262,A1ZGHFGVUF9SR9,B00542PSY2,William Amazzini,"[9, 11]","As the other reviewers have already noted, its Jason Statham movie time and this time we have one of his most well rounded roles as an ex-cop who gets involved in an incredible story line involving the Russian and Chinese Mafias mixed with infiltrated bad guys in the NY Police department leading all the way to the Mayor played by Chris Sarandon.  The performances throughout are outstanding and we even have a memorable cameo by Anson Mount who is brilliant on the AMC series 'HELL ON WHEELS' who has a history with Statham's character.  It also marks the film debut of Catherine Chan as Mia, the uber child with the fantastic memory who carries the story along with Statham on her little shoulders.  She is so good , she makes it look like she's been doing it since child birth. .The usual chases and shoot outs ensue but Director Boaz Yakin gives each sequence a fresh tone making you think you are seeing them for the first time(if that makes sense). The action never displaces the characters motivations and makes you feel for both sides of the coin.  My favorite line is when Sarandon tells Statham that he has balls coming to his office to which Statham retorts ,'Yeah, they're so heavy, I can't walk'. The Blu-Ray has an excellent 7.1 DTS-HD Audio Master track and is presented in a 2.35 aspect ratio.  It also contains audio commentary by the director and 3 featurettes on the stunt work and the actors on the production.  I anticipate every movie featuring Jason Statham who seems to have evolved into the Steve McQueen of our generation and like him , he never disappoints. His performance is lethal but emotional in this one and show his ability to stretch making his living nightmare all the more tragic in his isolation. The climax also leaves the option of a sequel so lets hope Director Yakin delivers it.

He was a cop, then a cage fighter, and now he is homeless and beat up and thinks about suicide. Until by accident he meets Mei a young Chinese math genius with a huge secret and a great memory. They meet in a subway station when he is ready to jump in front of the train.There are many people who are chasing Mei: the corrupt cops, the Chinese mafia, and the Russian mafia. And all this because her uncle asked her to memorize a series of numbers. What are those numbers for? You need to watch the movie in order to understand. However, if you ask me I don't think is wise to share such an important number with anybody but yourself. Remember when a secret is known by more than one person, then is not a secret anymore.This movie is really a redox of ""Leon the Professional"", or ""Gloria"" but much less sophisticated and way more brutal and more graphic. I am certain that the people, who wrote the movie and directed it, had seen the old movie with Natalie Portman, Jean Reno, and Gary Oldman or the older movie with the fantastic performance of Gena Rowlands. Hopefully the young Mei will have the career of Natalie Portman. That remains to be seen. I was not impressed with her performance in this movie.Good action movie, good fighting as always (in movies with Stratham), lots of blood and broken bones with predictable ending.
