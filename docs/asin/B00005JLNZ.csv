602442,AFXTPJOE2D4M3,B00005JLNZ,Algernon D'Ammassa,"[7, 9]","A golden premise and a good cast are not enough to reclaim this movie from such a hollow script.  Ultimately, this may be worth renting, but as an evening out you may be disappointed, as this offers surprisingly few laughs and not very good drama.Goldie Hawn plays a bubbly bartender at L.A.'s Whisky-a-Gogo who, back in the sixties, was one of two legendary groupies dubbed (by Frank Zappa, no less) as ""the Banger Sisters.""  When Suzette finds herself hired by the young management, she jumps in her car and drives to Arizona to catch up with her fellow Banger, who has gone completely straight, has a wealthy lawyer husband and a perfect suburban life, and does not welcome the living reminder of her wild past.All kinds of dramatic possibilities are botched.  Susan Sarandon, as ""Vinnie""-""Lavinia,"" does her best to make some sense but there's not much there.  Her transformation consists of a mysterious comment about Jim Morrison, and an unmotivated food fight.  ""I lost me,"" she says, but there is no glimpse of what that is, or how she reconciles it with the life she has now.  The family complains that their life has been ruined, when nothing seems to have happened.  And Sarandon is condemned to do meaningful things with her eyes at the end, when it is not clear how she or her family has changed. (Except for her haircut, that is.)  Her best scene is when she is surprised at a compromising moment by her family, and is struggling to keep her mature-mom mask on despite the hilarity that is breaking through; at last, life! Real human behavior!Nothing is done with the character of the husband, and that is a terrible mistake.  Also, we are cheated because we do not get to see the hilarious teenage daughters forced to re-evaluate her mom and realize she's ""cool.""  We are primed to expect that scene, and it is LARCENY not to show it to us.Finally, there is poor Geoffery Rush playing an obsessive-compulsive writer carrying a briefcase with an old typewriter, and a gun with one bullet.  Another potentially interesting element lost in the soundtrack of sixties' covers, condemned to lines such as, ""I think you're my muse,"" and unmotivated dancing.In sum, the film offers no surprises, and a lot of unprovoked sentimentality over substance.  The actors truly make the most of the material and offer some entertainment, but in all it was a disappointment.",3,Terrific Cast Trudges Through Hollywood ...,1032652800,"09 22, 2002",2002,2371,"['golden', 'premise', 'good', 'cast', 'are', 'not', 'enough', 'reclaim', 'movie', 'such', 'hollow', 'script', 'Ultimately', 'may', 'be', 'worth', 'renting', 'evening', 'out', 'may', 'be', 'disappointed', 'surprisingly', 'few', 'laughs', 'not', 'very', 'good', 'drama.Goldie', 'Hawn', 'bubbly', 'bartender', 'L.A.', 'Whisky-a-Gogo', 'who', 'back', 'sixties', 'was', 'one', 'two', 'legendary', 'groupies', 'dubbed', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'less', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'When', 'Suzette', 'hired', 'young', 'management', 'car', 'Arizona', 'catch', 'up', 'fellow', 'Banger', 'who', 'gone', 'completely', 'straight', 'wealthy', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'perfect', 'suburban', 'life', 'not', 'welcome', 'living', 'reminder', 'wild', 'past.All', 'kinds', 'dramatic', 'possibilities', 'are', 'botched', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Vinnie', 'Lavinia', 'best', 'make', 'sense', 'not', 'much', 'there', 'transformation', 'mysterious', 'comment', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'unmotivated', 'food', 'fight', 'lost', 'glimpse', 'what', 'how', 'life', 'now', 'family', 'life', 'been', 'ruined', 'when', 'nothing', 'have', 'happened', 'Sarandon', 'condemned', 'do', 'meaningful', 'things', 'eyes', 'end', 'when', 'not', 'clear', 'how', 'family', 'changed', 'haircut', 'best', 'scene', 'when', 'surprised', 'compromising', 'moment', 'family', 'struggling', 'keep', 'mature-mom', 'mask', 'hilarity', 'breaking', 'last', 'life', 'Real', 'human', 'behavior', 'Nothing', 'done', 'character', 'husband', 'terrible', 'mistake', 'Also', 'are', 'cheated', 'do', 'not', 'get', 'see', 'hilarious', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'forced', 're-evaluate', 'mom', 'realize', 'cool', 'are', 'primed', 'expect', 'scene', 'LARCENY', 'not', 'show', 'us.Finally', 'poor', 'Geoffery', 'Rush', 'playing', 'obsessive-compulsive', 'writer', 'carrying', 'briefcase', 'old', 'typewriter', 'gun', 'one', 'bullet', 'potentially', 'interesting', 'element', 'lost', 'soundtrack', 'sixties', 'covers', 'condemned', 'lines', 'such', 'think', ""'re"", 'muse', 'unmotivated', 'dancing.In', 'sum', 'film', 'surprises', 'lot', 'unprovoked', 'sentimentality', 'substance', 'actors', 'truly', 'make', 'most', 'material', 'offer', 'entertainment', 'was', 'disappointment']",The Banger Sisters
602443,A2YH3YTPSCAWF9,B00005JLNZ,"Anthony Marinelli ""marilread""","[0, 0]","An interesting film of generational change in america as we have in an opening scene we see a picture of the Hawn character,rocking and in a bar,and she seems to be a flower child,but she's a partyer from the past who really doesnt change. The person enjoying herself and not wanting to change. She meets a man called Harry who is the opposite of the partyer,dour and circumspect. He's a man who structures everything about his world,encloses and creates an environment for himself,and apart from the sensual Hawn character he is a thinker,seeking to understand and explore although he has a problem with a father character we will learn of later. The hawn character just wants physical sex no deep relationship with male(banger as in bang-her)that is the only relationship she will have with men...the deep relationship she wants,the spiritual is with the Sarandon character,and they are like sisters and the Sarandon character has made a transformation from hippie to mother..although she lapses. There are scenes of parties with girls,and how these mothers deal with them,but the film explores the tripartite relationship betweeen the three characters and that's where the interest lies and also generational change. An interesting ending is the harry character who barney fife like with one bullet in a frenzy wants to kill dad for a ruined life and in these scenes the two female characters restrain him...i find the film interesting as an exploration of bonding,and the character of harry who tries to frame and impose a meaning of life and the Hawn character he meets but life just wont fit into his pattern,his life is meaningless and frustrating,the pistol,which just shows how the most ardent attempts to understandind life scientifically can be waylaid on the pursuit of revenge...he should put the father image out of his mind and learn to love the hawn character..learning how to love is a better vocation than the science type mind,...the film ends with the two woman and the milk billboard,where's the milk,...entertaining little film and its really goldie's film but sarandon provides great support...she's more costar here and is better showcased elsewhere",4,interesting film of generational film,1338422400,"05 31, 2012",2012,2173,"['interesting', 'film', 'generational', 'change', 'america', 'have', 'opening', 'scene', 'see', 'picture', 'Hawn', 'character', 'rocking', 'bar', 'be', 'flower', 'child', 'partyer', 'past', 'who', 'really', 'doesnt', 'change', 'person', 'enjoying', 'not', 'wanting', 'change', 'man', 'called', 'Harry', 'who', 'opposite', 'partyer', 'dour', 'circumspect', 'man', 'who', 'everything', 'world', 'encloses', 'environment', 'apart', 'sensual', 'Hawn', 'character', 'thinker', 'seeking', 'understand', 'explore', 'problem', 'father', 'character', 'will', 'learn', 'later', 'hawn', 'character', 'just', 'physical', 'sex', 'deep', 'relationship', 'male', 'banger', 'bang-her', 'only', 'relationship', 'will', 'have', 'men', 'deep', 'relationship', 'spiritual', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'are', 'sisters', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'made', 'transformation', 'hippie', 'mother..although', 'are', 'scenes', 'parties', 'girls', 'how', 'mothers', 'deal', 'film', 'tripartite', 'relationship', 'betweeen', 'three', 'characters', 'where', 'interest', 'also', 'generational', 'change', 'interesting', 'ending', 'harry', 'character', 'who', 'barney', 'fife', 'one', 'bullet', 'frenzy', 'kill', 'dad', 'ruined', 'life', 'scenes', 'two', 'female', 'characters', 'restrain', 'i', 'find', 'film', 'interesting', 'exploration', 'bonding', 'character', 'harry', 'who', 'frame', 'impose', 'meaning', 'life', 'Hawn', 'character', 'life', 'just', 'wont', 'fit', 'pattern', 'life', 'meaningless', 'frustrating', 'pistol', 'just', 'how', 'most', 'ardent', 'attempts', 'understandind', 'life', 'scientifically', 'can', 'be', 'waylaid', 'pursuit', 'revenge', 'should', 'put', 'father', 'image', 'mind', 'learn', 'love', 'hawn', 'character..learning', 'how', 'love', 'better', 'vocation', 'science', 'type', 'mind', 'film', 'two', 'woman', 'milk', 'billboard', 'where', 'milk', 'entertaining', 'little', 'film', 'really', 'goldie', 'film', 'sarandon', 'great', 'support', 'more', 'costar', 'here', 'better', 'showcased', 'elsewhere']",The Banger Sisters
602444,A1GVKGSN6V1VTX,B00005JLNZ,Arctic Voice Earl,"[4, 5]","I agree with some of the previous reviews that this movie has redeeming qualities (especially nostalgia for the 60s), which overshadow its discount,economy-type plot.Also great to have Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon together, and playing off one another, while they are still in their prime. Call me a fan, but they are both unique individuals and beautiful women.Right now in this great nation, we cold use a good shot of the 1960s,and it is great to relax after a day of 24-hour-cable coverage of the war, load up on some twinkies and Tang,and relive the 60s,and then how we all got sidetracked, far away from the original ""cause"" and our college graduation vision to ""change the world for the better.""  Whatever happened to all that?The movie gives us the extreme, just so we don't miss the point.  And it also gives us a bonus -- Geoffrey Rush, as the eccentric cash cow who funds a cash-challenged Hawn on her pilgrimage to reunite with Sarandon. Susan is rich, but not happy.No big violent chase scene in this movie, but lots of chatter between the ""Bangers"" who did just thatwhen Frank Zappa and Steppenwolf and the Doors and so many others told us what was happening, and inspired us to try and make this a better world.

Lavinia (played by Susan Sarandon) and Suzette (played by Goldie Hawn) were rock groupies when they were young but then they diverged. They apparently were sexually involved with many of the most famous musicians of the sixties.Lavinia has gone on to be a very prim and proper resident of the affluent suburbs, married to a professional man with two daughters. Suzette is still a free spirit, working as a barmaid, living from paycheck to paycheck but slowly losing financial ground. When she loses her job, she decides to go visit Lavinia and relive old times. Hopping in her car, she runs out of gas at a backwater gas station and bus stop.She is fortunate to encounter a very neurotic writer (played by Geoffrey Rush) that would rather ride with her than stay on a bus. He is a man that is on the last level of life; he considers himself a failure, blames his father and is in a depressive spiral. Lavinia is surprised to see Suzette, it jars old memories that still remain suppressed but you can see that they are fond ones.The events after this are very predictable as the two former friends try to reconcile their pasts and try to incorporate it into their current lives.

Vinnie (Susan Sarandon) lives a beige existence in a tony Phoenix suburb where she and her staid attorney husband are raising two teenage girls; she is the suburban matron to beat all matrons.  When her long-ago fellow groupie friend Suzette (Goldie Hawn) arrives on the scene, all Vinnie's careful layers of respect are peeled back to reveal a rock 'n roller at heart, and she begins to see what she has sacrificed to arrive at her middle-aged life.  Of course there's a sisterhood message -  live true to yourself - but it becomes pathetic in the hands of these fifty-something year old actresses.  The real fun comes in the chemistry between the actresses.  Sarandon's transformation from repressed housewife to a straight-shooting woman is surprisingly nuanced.  Hawn's Suzette is more ridiculous, both visually and in character, as her hippy attitude and floozy dress seem more worn than wise.  Eva Amurri, who plays Vinnie's goofy daughter Ginger is charming in her small part while Erika Christiansen as her older sister Hannah is more lackluster.  Geoffrey Rush as a man Suzette rescues from his own blandness is adorably enthusiastic, although his character's function in this thin screenplay is questionable.This predictable chick flick is saved from complete obscurity by its stars who lend just the right element of fun to self-discovery.  This is a good mindless flick that I'd recommend renting instead of buying.

Von Behren ""reneofc""","[5, 6]","I was surprised to be viewing this movie with an audience of white haired senior citizens who responded with knowing laughter to the film in all the right places.  Just goes to show you that appearances are definitely deceiving as relayed as part of 'The Banger Sister's' tried-but-true message.Vinnie, played by Susan Sarandon, is a perfectly coiffed and meticulously dressed suburban matron with two spoiled teenaged daughters and a harmless husband she devotes her entire life to keeping in line.  Her groupie 'Banger Sister' from 20+ years earlier is Suzette, (Goldie Hawn) who basically has nothing to show for her life other than the fact that she has maintained her persona as rock and roll groupie---with her you pretty much get what you see--and then some.The plot revolves around the culture clash that occurs when the two cross paths again.  The resulting scenes are funny and at times poignant, causing us all to remember our own good times with old friends.  Unfortunately, the film's overkill trailers on television and theatres showcase all of the funnier moments, causing them to be less funny as they are already anticipated.  Nevertheless, the duo pull it off with Sarandon finally snapping out of her suburban fantasyland with a few tantrums that work and a few that don't work, transforming herself into more of what you would expect her to be with such a wild past and rediscovering what is really 'fun' in life: friends, family and being true to oneself.  Especially laugh-out-loud funny was a scene where Vinnie and Suzette explore their former conquests by looking through an old box of 'photographs.'  Very amusing, particularly when Vinnie's husband catches them in the act.Although the film is a comedy, Vinnie's suburban dilemma is quite realistic as there are so many women that instead of evolving, lose themselves in some cardboard representation of morality and pretention.I recommend the film for its sheer fun factor--go in wanting and expecting to laugh and think of all the stupid things you did as a teenager and young adult with pleasure, not shame.",3,Funny and Poignant,1033171200,"09 28, 2002",2002,2087,"['was', 'surprised', 'be', 'viewing', 'movie', 'audience', 'white', 'haired', 'senior', 'citizens', 'who', 'responded', 'knowing', 'laughter', 'film', 'right', 'places', 'Just', 'show', 'appearances', 'are', 'definitely', 'deceiving', 'as', 'relayed', 'part', ""'The"", 'Banger', 'Sister', 'tried-but-true', 'message.Vinnie', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'perfectly', 'coiffed', 'meticulously', 'dressed', 'suburban', 'matron', 'two', 'spoiled', 'teenaged', 'daughters', 'harmless', 'husband', 'entire', 'life', 'keeping', 'line', 'groupie', 'Sister', '20+', 'years', 'earlier', 'Suzette', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'who', 'basically', 'nothing', 'show', 'life', 'other', 'fact', 'maintained', 'persona', 'rock', 'roll', 'groupie', 'pretty', 'much', 'get', 'what', 'see', 'then', 'some.The', 'plot', 'revolves', 'culture', 'clash', 'when', 'two', 'cross', 'paths', 'again', 'resulting', 'scenes', 'are', 'funny', 'times', 'poignant', 'causing', 'remember', 'own', 'good', 'times', 'old', 'friends', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'overkill', 'trailers', 'television', 'showcase', 'funnier', 'moments', 'causing', 'be', 'less', 'funny', 'are', 'already', 'anticipated', 'Nevertheless', 'duo', 'pull', 'off', 'Sarandon', 'finally', 'snapping', 'suburban', 'fantasyland', 'few', 'tantrums', 'work', 'few', 'do', ""n't"", 'work', 'transforming', 'more', 'what', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'such', 'wild', 'past', 'rediscovering', 'what', 'really', ""'fun"", 'life', 'friends', 'family', 'being', 'true', 'oneself', 'Especially', 'laugh-out-loud', 'funny', 'was', 'scene', 'where', 'Vinnie', 'Suzette', 'explore', 'former', 'conquests', 'looking', 'old', 'box', ""'photographs"", 'Very', 'amusing', 'particularly', 'when', 'Vinnie', 'husband', 'act.Although', 'film', 'comedy', 'Vinnie', 'suburban', 'dilemma', 'quite', 'realistic', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'women', 'instead', 'evolving', 'lose', 'cardboard', 'representation', 'morality', 'pretention.I', 'recommend', 'film', 'sheer', 'fun', 'factor', 'go', 'wanting', 'expecting', 'laugh', 'think', 'stupid', 'things', 'did', 'teenager', 'young', 'adult', 'pleasure', 'not', 'shame']",The Banger Sisters

Meanwhile, her sidekick Lavinia, or ""Vinnie"" as she was called back in the day, is an uptight housewife married to a lawyer running for office with two spoiled and unhappy daughters.  After being fired from her last job, Suzette goes out to Arizona to find her friend after all these years.  She meets Harry, a screenwriter with writer's block and unresolved issues with his father.  Harry and her share a hotel.  Suzette seeks to find her friend which she does.  But Lavinia is different from what she remembers in the sixties.  Lavinia is uptight and reserved about her past.  Her family doesn't know about her past which is bad.  Her daughters are struggling to find their own identity drinking, having sex, and crashing cars.  Vinnie kept her past from her children thinking that she was protecting them but she wasn't.  The comforts of wealth shielded her true self.Feeling trapped in her lifestyle, Vinnie decides that she must relive the past with Suzette and both women go out and have themselves a good time like they did when they were teenagers.  Meanwhile, Harry has overcome his writer's block and is able to write.  But he is haunted by memories of his father which he has to resolve once and for all.If Vinnie was upfront with her past life to her family, her daughters would have an understanding of what is wrong and what is right and they would have made decisions based on their own assumptions.  Her husband would have respected her as the woman she is.  He was more concerned about his political career and she was too busy protecting her past to appease him.

Two likeable, Oscar-winning actresses playing former rock groupies getting back together after twenty years.  And Goldie Hawn does give it a good try for awhile.But this film is just filled with cardboard characters, Hollywood stereotypes portraying mostly uptight characters in the world Hawn re-enters.  You see, Sarandon left the groupie life for a ""better"" life years ago, and does not even want to acknowledge her past.  Not to her husband, whose stereotype is the man trying to keep squeaky clean so he can run for office.  And especially not her teenage daughters, who are eagerly trying all of life's little evils, and would love to see a crack in mom's armor.So we get a bunch of totally predictable scenes where Sarandon first rejects Hawn, then they slowly get comfortable with each other, and well, you know the rest.

Imagine if Janet Veiss (Weiss!) settled down to a normal middle-class life in Denton with someone other than Brad Majors after the servants in The Rocky Horror Picture Show had all ""gone to a distant planet.""  (I know, I know, there was a sequel, Shock Treatment, but let's just forget that, shall we?  I think the writer Richard O'Brien would like to.). . . And imagine that Janet's new husband, who's made a lot of money working for Professor Scott's (or should I say VON Scott's?) military-industrial firm as a lawyer, now wants a political career which requires the voters think his wife is a perfect homemaker and mother, with no sexual shenanigans in her past.. . . Suddenly, twenty years later, Betty Monroe shows up, after dumping Ralph (he always was a lucky guy!), to tell Janet's spoiled family just what Janet got up to when she and Brad were two kids on a night out who came upon a light over at the Frankenstein place.I've gone way too far with this, but it's the set-up for The Banger Sisters, starring Goldie Hawn as Betty Monroe (Suzette) and (do you believe it?!) Susan Sarandon as Janet Weiss (Lavinia).Society wife Lavinia and bartender Suzette were dubbed ""the Banger Sisters"" by Frank Zappa for all the rock stars they - -  knew - -  back in the seventies.  Lavinia still has her ""rock [rhymes with rock] collection"" of photographs of famous musicians' instruments (or should I say musicians' famous instruments?).Lavinia has ""lost herself"" in the needs of her husband and daughters.  Suzette helps Lavinia learn to dance again (this is the symbolism, folks) and convinces Lavinia's family to accept her for herself, not just for how she can fulfill their needs.The Banger Sisters is an okay comedy, but everyone's acceptance of everyone else at the end is a little too pat (typical for a Hollywood movie).  Apparently there are no serious psychological consequences for all that waking up under dudes like Keith and Jim.The story of the guy Suzette picks up (played by Geoffrey Rush) to pay for gas to get to Lavinia's home in Phoenix is more interesting.  He's fifty, loaded with nervous tics, and has spent twenty years in Los Angeles trying to be a screenwriter and is coming home to make peace with his father.  You'll see that plot twist coming.  If Rush's character represents the middle road between excess (Suzette) and repression (Lavinia) all I can say is Yikes!I wanted to like this movie because the actors are so good, but director Lisa Cholodenko's Laurel Canyon starring Frances McDormand is a more adult story on a similar theme with characters that seem like real people.",3,Janet All Grown Up,1076025600,"02 6, 2004",2004,2670,"['Let', 'may', 'take', 'strange', 'journey', '..', 'Imagine', 'Janet', 'Veiss', 'Weiss', 'settled', 'down', 'normal', 'middle-class', 'life', 'Denton', 'someone', 'other', 'Brad', 'Majors', 'servants', 'Rocky', 'Horror', 'Picture', 'Show', 'had', 'gone', 'distant', 'planet', 'know', 'know', 'was', 'sequel', 'Shock', 'Treatment', 'let', 'just', 'forget', 'shall', 'think', 'writer', 'Richard', ""O'Brien"", 'would', 'like', 'to.', 'imagine', 'Janet', 'new', 'husband', 'who', 'made', 'lot', 'money', 'working', 'Professor', 'Scott', 'should', 'say', 'VON', 'Scott', 'military-industrial', 'firm', 'lawyer', 'now', 'political', 'career', 'voters', 'think', 'wife', 'perfect', 'homemaker', 'mother', 'sexual', 'shenanigans', 'past..', 'Suddenly', 'twenty', 'years', 'later', 'Betty', 'Monroe', 'up', 'dumping', 'Ralph', 'always', 'was', 'lucky', 'guy', 'tell', 'Janet', 'spoiled', 'family', 'just', 'what', 'Janet', 'got', 'up', 'when', 'Brad', 'were', 'two', 'kids', 'night', 'out', 'who', 'came', 'light', 'Frankenstein', 'place.I', ""'ve"", 'gone', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'set-up', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'starring', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Betty', 'Monroe', 'Suzette', 'do', 'believe', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Janet', 'Weiss', 'Lavinia', '.Society', 'wife', 'Lavinia', 'bartender', 'Suzette', 'were', 'dubbed', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'rock', 'knew', 'back', 'seventies', 'Lavinia', 'still', 'rock', '[', 'rock', ']', 'collection', 'photographs', 'famous', 'musicians', 'instruments', 'should', 'say', 'musicians', 'famous', 'instruments', '.Lavinia', 'lost', 'needs', 'husband', 'daughters', 'Suzette', 'Lavinia', 'learn', 'dance', 'again', 'symbolism', 'folks', 'Lavinia', 'family', 'accept', 'herself', 'not', 'just', 'how', 'can', 'fulfill', 'needs.The', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'okay', 'comedy', 'everyone', 'acceptance', 'everyone', 'else', 'end', 'little', 'too', 'pat', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'Apparently', 'are', 'serious', 'psychological', 'consequences', 'waking', 'up', 'dudes', 'Keith', 'Jim.The', 'story', 'guy', 'Suzette', 'up', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'pay', 'gas', 'get', 'Lavinia', 'home', 'Phoenix', 'more', 'interesting', 'fifty', 'loaded', 'nervous', 'tics', 'spent', 'twenty', 'years', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'trying', 'be', 'screenwriter', 'coming', 'home', 'make', 'peace', 'father', ""'ll"", 'see', 'plot', 'twist', 'coming', 'Rush', 'character', 'middle', 'road', 'excess', 'Suzette', 'repression', 'Lavinia', 'can', 'say', 'Yikes', 'wanted', 'like', 'movie', 'actors', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'director', 'Lisa', 'Cholodenko', 'Laurel', 'Canyon', 'starring', 'Frances', 'McDormand', 'more', 'adult', 'story', 'similar', 'theme', 'characters', 'seem', 'real', 'people']",The Banger Sisters

The Sarandon character has suppressed all of that, is married with two kids, and has had her personality disappear.  The Hawn character is still a free spirit and revels in her past.  However, she is now wise.  Of course, the Hawn character seeks out the Sarandon character and reinvigorates her life, and her family is grateful that their wife and mother was once a world class groupie.I believe that there is a certain consensus about this film.  The script is pretty weak regardless of its subject matter.

602475,A2DSXA1E02C86D,B00005JLNZ,Joseph Haschka,"[6, 7]","In THE BANGER SISTERS, Goldie Hawn doesn't giggle as much as she did thirty-two years ago on ""Laugh-In"", but, under that unruly mop of blond hair, she can still give that crooked little grin that's just so darned appealing.Goldie plays Suzette, an aging ex-groupie of the sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll generation who's a legend in her own mind and, undoubtedly, in the libidos of all the musicians she slept with. Just fired from her bartending gig at a Hollywood club by a young boss who doesn't have the proper respect for historical figures, Suzette sets out by car for Phoenix to look up Lavinia (Susan Sarandon), her pal and fellow groupie from the good old days.  Along the way, she picks up Harry (Geoffrey Rush), a tightly wound wannabe writer that hasn't had sex in ten years and travels with a pistol loaded with one bullet. She arrives at her destination only to discover that Lavinia has ""gone straight"", i.e., is married to a lawyer and living a constipated middle-class existence in the affluent suburbs with two spoiled daughters, a banana hammock, and an all-beige wardrobe.The plot of this film is about nothing more than the effect of Suzette's uninhibited ebullience on Harry, Lavinia, and the latter's family. And, it should have been limited to just Lavinia's small circle if the editing department had perhaps done the smart thing and relegated the subplot involving Harry to the cutting room floor. Sarandon does well enough as a responsible Mom divesting herself of the inhibitions that have layered themselves over a formerly free spirit. To that end, her husband and daughters are nothing more than animated props serving as foils to this process catalyzed by the intrusion of Suzette into their overly-ordered lives. There's one sequence in the family basement involving some revealing old Polaroids that's worth the price of admission.The best reason to see THE BANGER SISTERS is Goldie Hawn, who, at 57, has aged well. She must work out. And when did she get so, um, stacked? Suzette makes a point of telling Lavinia that not everything one sees under her tank top is real. Perhaps that's it - but the effect is remarkable, especially if one remembers the Goldie of an earlier age. In any case, this film doesn't approach being memorable, but the effervescent Ms. Hawn has earned the right to be remembered simply for the delight she's provided fans over the decades.",3,Goldie is aging well,1034035200,"10 8, 2002",2002,2396,"['THE', 'BANGER', 'SISTERS', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', ""n't"", 'giggle', 'as', 'much', 'did', 'thirty-two', 'years', 'ago', 'Laugh-In', 'unruly', 'mop', 'blond', 'hair', 'can', 'still', 'give', 'crooked', 'little', 'grin', 'just', 'so', 'darned', 'appealing.Goldie', 'plays', 'Suzette', 'aging', 'ex-groupie', 'sex', 'drugs', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'generation', 'who', 'legend', 'own', 'mind', 'undoubtedly', 'libidos', 'musicians', 'slept', 'Just', 'fired', 'bartending', 'gig', 'Hollywood', 'club', 'young', 'boss', 'who', ""n't"", 'have', 'proper', 'respect', 'historical', 'figures', 'Suzette', 'out', 'car', 'Phoenix', 'look', 'up', 'Lavinia', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'pal', 'fellow', 'groupie', 'good', 'old', 'days', 'way', 'up', 'Harry', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'tightly', 'wound', 'wannabe', 'writer', ""n't"", 'had', 'sex', 'ten', 'years', 'travels', 'pistol', 'loaded', 'one', 'bullet', 'destination', 'only', 'discover', 'Lavinia', 'gone', 'straight', 'i.e.', 'married', 'lawyer', 'living', 'constipated', 'middle-class', 'existence', 'affluent', 'suburbs', 'two', 'spoiled', 'daughters', 'banana', 'hammock', 'all-beige', 'wardrobe.The', 'plot', 'film', 'nothing', 'more', 'effect', 'Suzette', 'uninhibited', 'ebullience', 'Harry', 'Lavinia', 'latter', 'family', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'limited', 'just', 'Lavinia', 'small', 'circle', 'editing', 'department', 'had', 'perhaps', 'done', 'smart', 'thing', 'relegated', 'subplot', 'involving', 'Harry', 'cutting', 'room', 'floor', 'Sarandon', 'well', 'enough', 'responsible', 'Mom', 'divesting', 'inhibitions', 'have', 'layered', 'formerly', 'free', 'spirit', 'end', 'husband', 'daughters', 'are', 'nothing', 'more', 'animated', 'props', 'serving', 'as', 'foils', 'process', 'catalyzed', 'intrusion', 'Suzette', 'overly-ordered', 'lives', 'one', 'sequence', 'family', 'basement', 'involving', 'revealing', 'old', 'Polaroids', 'price', 'admission.The', 'best', 'reason', 'see', 'THE', 'BANGER', 'SISTERS', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'who', '57', 'aged', 'well', 'must', 'work', 'out', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'so', 'um', 'stacked', 'Suzette', 'point', 'telling', 'Lavinia', 'not', 'everything', 'one', 'tank', 'top', 'real', 'Perhaps', 'effect', 'remarkable', 'especially', 'one', 'Goldie', 'earlier', 'age', 'case', 'film', ""n't"", 'approach', 'being', 'memorable', 'effervescent', 'Ms.', 'Hawn', 'earned', 'right', 'be', 'remembered', 'simply', 'delight', 'provided', 'fans', 'decades']",The Banger Sisters

Of course she is not without hangups but she has chosen to live her life more in the moment and with an openness that is great! She plays a different hippie type not the wide eyed naive innocent. Suzette has been around, hence the name Banger Sister. Some might find her a little crude, but never dishonest. Sarandon plays the other sister who has lost her playfulness and has immersed herself in mommyhood and being the best wife on the block syndrome. Suzette comes back to remind her of who she really is and how to get back in touch with it. Mainly reeducating her about how to let go and just breath, enjoying the moment for what it is.

Goldie Hawn (Town & Country, Out-Of Towners) plays a character that is so far from her normal persona that it almost didn't work. But by the end you realize that Goldie is the cornerstone for many of the characters in the film. Primarily that of the talented Susan Sarandon (Cradle Will Rock, Cat's and Dogs) who transformation and power shift really is believable.The film is directed by Bob Dolman (writer of Far and Away, Willow ) who takes a while to get the story moving but once the two ladies get their characters in gear - it picks up,. Some wonderful performances by Susan's oldest daughter played by Erika Christianson (Swim Fan, Traffic) and her husband played by Robin Thomas (Clockstoppers, Bullworth) and the their contrast in understanding what their lives are really about.Basically it's the story of a two women who were wild and crazy with sex and rock'n'roll in their youth having been separated as time does to everyone and then meeting again twenty years later. Goldie is Suzette a broken down woman who lives the life of a Bar tender in Hollywood and Susan plays Lavine a house wife with a great home, children, family and money. They meet again and realize what they meant to each other and who they really are. There is a standout surprise performance by Geoffrey Rush (Quills, Shakespeare In Love) as a writer with an issue. Again Goldie guides her way in and out of his life for an almost believable storybook ending.I enjoyed this movie. Nothing really special, but its heart is in the right place!

602484,A152C8GYY25HAH,B00005JLNZ,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","""The Banger Sisters"" is the kind of movie to which the phrase ""it was cute"" is frequently applied. Indeed, it is cute as cute can be, but, considering the pedigree of its stars, one would expect it to be far more than merely cute. Its makers seem to have forgotten that many serious themes can successfully be addressed through comedy.This is the tale of two middle-aged women, Suzette and Lavinia [Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon] who were best friends twenty years ago. They were groupies who hung out with rock stars both famous and infamous. Today their lives have gone opposing routes. Suzette is still in the rock and roll world in Los Angeles, while Lavinia has become a well-to-do Phoenix matron with the requisite lawyer husband, overachieving children, and suburban mansion replete with swimming pool. When Suzette is fired from her bartending job and evicted from her apartment, she decides to hop a bus and pay her old friend a visit. Along the way, she picks up a neurotic screen writer [Geoffrey Rush], who follows along on her journey. The surprise reunion causes problems in Lavinia's life but also uncovers problems Suzette is best able to solve.The movie is almost worth watching just to see two great actresses at work. They play off of each other easily and obviously had a lot of fun making the film. The subplot wastes Rush, takes away from more interesting moments, and serves merely to provide a predictable happy ending for Suzette. The social issues, which include drugs and sex among teenagers, are there to show that times haven't changed all that much since the two friends were kids. They are handled in a tentative and pedestrian manner that kills much of the fun. A wittier, more sophisticated screenplay would have made this a winning comedy. As it is, it rarely gets to first base, despite the valiant efforts of its cast.",3,Great cast valiantly battles weak script,1044144000,"02 2, 2003",2003,1855,"['Banger', 'Sisters', 'kind', 'movie', 'phrase', 'was', 'cute', 'frequently', 'applied', 'Indeed', 'cute', 'cute', 'can', 'be', 'considering', 'pedigree', 'stars', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'merely', 'cute', 'makers', 'seem', 'have', 'forgotten', 'many', 'serious', 'themes', 'can', 'successfully', 'be', 'addressed', 'comedy.This', 'tale', 'two', 'middle-aged', 'women', 'Suzette', 'Lavinia', '[', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', ']', 'who', 'were', 'best', 'friends', 'twenty', 'years', 'ago', 'were', 'groupies', 'who', 'hung', 'out', 'rock', 'stars', 'famous', 'infamous', 'Today', 'lives', 'have', 'gone', 'opposing', 'routes', 'Suzette', 'still', 'rock', 'roll', 'world', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'Lavinia', 'become', 'well-to-do', 'Phoenix', 'matron', 'requisite', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'overachieving', 'children', 'suburban', 'mansion', 'replete', 'swimming', 'pool', 'When', 'Suzette', 'fired', 'bartending', 'job', 'evicted', 'apartment', 'hop', 'bus', 'pay', 'old', 'friend', 'visit', 'way', 'up', 'neurotic', 'screen', 'writer', '[', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', ']', 'who', 'along', 'journey', 'surprise', 'reunion', 'problems', 'Lavinia', 'life', 'also', 'uncovers', 'problems', 'Suzette', 'best', 'able', 'solve.The', 'movie', 'almost', 'worth', 'watching', 'just', 'see', 'two', 'great', 'actresses', 'work', 'play', 'other', 'easily', 'obviously', 'had', 'lot', 'fun', 'making', 'film', 'subplot', 'Rush', 'away', 'more', 'interesting', 'moments', 'merely', 'provide', 'predictable', 'happy', 'ending', 'Suzette', 'social', 'issues', 'include', 'drugs', 'sex', 'teenagers', 'are', 'there', 'show', 'times', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'that', 'much', 'two', 'friends', 'were', 'kids', 'are', 'handled', 'tentative', 'pedestrian', 'manner', 'much', 'fun', 'wittier', 'more', 'sophisticated', 'screenplay', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'winning', 'comedy', 'rarely', 'first', 'base', 'valiant', 'efforts', 'cast']",The Banger Sisters

I think Susan Sarandon is an amazing actress, but haven't seen Goldie Hawn in anything, but I love her daughter.It's amazing how you lose contact with friends over the years. You go through primary school thinking you'll always be friends; you go to high school, they become ""cool"", and you're no longer ""cool""; you leave school totally bitter, and find some new friends, hopefully who'll remain with you throughout thick & thin. I'm an early 20 something, compared to the 40/50 somethings that Susan & Goldie were playing in this, but I know it hurts, especially when you find them online, and they look all happy. But to go through 20 years or so, and rediscover a friendship. Wow. Which is exactly what Goldie & Susan's character do in this.What changes when you grow up? A lot, as Susan's character ""Lavinia"" goes from rock chick groupie ""Vinnie"" to uptight mother of 2. Suzette goes from rock chick groupie to ... rock chick groupie. Many women will find a lot of experiences that happen in this movie that they will find in common with the characters, and despite being young, I did too. I loved how rediscovering her friendship with Suzette, Lavinia became Vinnie again, shocking her husband and two teenage girls. I hated her haircut though! Yikes!This is the fourth film that Susan & real life daughter Eva Amurri have starred in as mother and daughter, and they are such a joy to watch on screen, although Eva is wasted in this. The other daughter, played by Erika Christensen, gets a bigger role, mainly because she's going off the rails very, very slightly, and her mum catches her getting up to ""no good"" in the FAMILY swimming pool with her boyfriend. Shows you exactly uptight Lavinia is, although her day she took pictures of rock c***s, and still has them!This is a perfect movie for a girlie afternoon of pampering and just looking after yourself, without having to think too much about a twist or turn in the film.

Well, this movie is the opposite - a situation where a wide range of components are merge and somehow fail to to measure up to expectations.By now, everyone know the story: Goldie Hawn plays Suzette, an ex-bartender/groupie who looks up fellow ex-groupie Vinnie (Lavinia, played by Susan Sarandon). Along the way, she meets up with Geoffrey Rush's character, an aging, failed writer with father issues.The themes the movie tries to tackle - basically, being true to oneself and finding a sense of identity - are good ones. The script just isn't all that interesting. This should be a character driven movie, but it isn't. The director and writer just never create the tension needed to make me invest in these people. It takes too long for Suzette and Vinnie to hook up, and when they do, the time that Suzette's actually back in her life is too short to realistically cause the supposed chaos it does. The relationships just weren't developed enough to make me care.I have to say that the best thing about the movie was the acting. Susan Sarandon, as always, was brilliant. She did her best to make Vinnie real. That's quite an accomplishment, given how little was written for her. It's frustrating, because this role really could've been a twenty-first century statement about feminism, and where women are in society, and where we'd still like to go.The rest of the cast was equally impressive. Hawn was a great deal better than I expected - I'm not a fan of hers, yet I thoroughly enjoyed her performance. She gave Suzette depth, soul and layers. Geoffrey Rush was great; a wonderful mix of comedy and pathos. Still, I almost wish his character wasn't in the movie, because all his scenes took away from the time Hawn had with Sarandon and co. I really liked the teens who played Lavinia's daughters - both seemed realistic to me. Robin Thomas, as Lavinia's husband, was fine, although he didn't have much to do. He's a good actor, actually - he deserved a more well-defined role.In general, this movie gets a low rating from me not because it's bad, per se, but because it had the potential to be so much better. If you're a fan of Hawn, Sarandon, or Rush, it's worth it for the performances alone - just wait for the video/dvd.",2,Not worth the theatre ticket price,1034812800,"10 17, 2002",2002,2316,"['old', 'cliche', 'whole', 'greater', 'sum', 'parts', 'Well', 'movie', 'opposite', 'situation', 'where', 'wide', 'range', 'components', 'are', 'merge', 'somehow', 'fail', 'measure', 'up', 'expectations.By', 'now', 'everyone', 'know', 'story', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Suzette', 'ex-bartender/groupie', 'who', 'up', 'fellow', 'ex-groupie', 'Vinnie', 'Lavinia', 'played', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'way', 'up', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'character', 'aging', 'failed', 'writer', 'father', 'issues.The', 'movie', 'tackle', 'basically', 'being', 'true', 'oneself', 'finding', 'sense', 'identity', 'are', 'good', 'ones', 'script', 'just', ""n't"", 'interesting', 'should', 'be', 'character', 'driven', 'movie', ""n't"", 'director', 'writer', 'just', 'never', 'create', 'tension', 'needed', 'make', 'invest', 'people', 'too', 'long', 'Suzette', 'Vinnie', 'hook', 'up', 'when', 'do', 'time', 'Suzette', 'actually', 'back', 'life', 'too', 'short', 'realistically', 'cause', 'supposed', 'chaos', 'relationships', 'just', 'were', ""n't"", 'developed', 'enough', 'make', 'care.I', 'have', 'say', 'best', 'thing', 'movie', 'was', 'acting', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'always', 'was', 'brilliant', 'did', 'best', 'make', 'Vinnie', 'real', 'quite', 'accomplishment', 'given', 'how', 'little', 'was', 'written', 'frustrating', 'role', 'really', 'could', ""'ve"", 'been', 'twenty-first', 'century', 'statement', 'feminism', 'where', 'women', 'are', 'society', 'where', ""'d"", 'still', 'like', 'go.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'equally', 'impressive', 'Hawn', 'was', 'great', 'deal', 'better', 'expected', ""'m"", 'not', 'fan', 'hers', 'yet', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'performance', 'gave', 'Suzette', 'depth', 'soul', 'layers', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'was', 'great', 'wonderful', 'mix', 'comedy', 'pathos', 'Still', 'almost', 'wish', 'character', 'was', ""n't"", 'movie', 'scenes', 'took', 'away', 'time', 'Hawn', 'had', 'Sarandon', 'co', 'really', 'liked', 'teens', 'who', 'played', 'Lavinia', 'daughters', 'seemed', 'realistic', 'Robin', 'Thomas', 'Lavinia', 'husband', 'was', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'do', 'good', 'actor', 'actually', 'deserved', 'more', 'well-defined', 'role.In', 'general', 'movie', 'low', 'rating', 'not', 'bad', 'se', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'so', 'much', 'better', ""'re"", 'fan', 'Hawn', 'Sarandon', 'Rush', 'performances', 'alone', 'just', 'wait', 'video/dvd']",The Banger Sisters

But human nature being what it is, that&#65533;s not the way it works.  So we lose things; and the sad thing is, when it happens we&#65533;re not even aware of it.  And that&#65533;s what&#65533;s known as the human condition, which is exactly what writer/director Bob Dolman examines in &#65533;The Banger Sisters,&#65533; a poignant comedy/drama about what can happen when &#65533;life&#65533; happens, then realizing it, discovering what&#65533;s really important and finding those things that have been lost along the way.Suzette (Goldie Hawn) is a bartender, as well as a fixture since the &#65533;60s, at the famous Whiskey A-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip, where she once had a memorable &#65533;encounter&#65533; with the Lizard King, himself, Jim Morrison.  But as the song says, &#65533;time goes by,&#65533; and when-- due to circumstances within her control-- Suzette loses her job, she finds herself, in the immortal words of Ulysses Everett McGill, &#65533;In a tight spot.&#65533;  No savings, no prospects, no job; what&#65533;s an aging &#65533;groupie&#65533; to do?Look up an old friend, that&#65533;s what.  An old friend she hasn&#65533;t seen for some twenty years, but with whom Suzette shared the best times of her life, when they cut a swath across the rock scene in L.A., &#65533;rattling&#65533; every rock star that came to town, as well as a good number of ""roadies.&#65533;  But Vinnie (Susan Sarandon) now lives in Phoenix, Arizona, is married, has a couple of kids and is apparently living the American Dream, having been absorbed, mind and body, into the mores and morals of the textbook dictates of &#65533;proper&#65533; society.  The truth of the matter, however, is that Vinnie (make that &#65533;Lavinia&#65533; now) is living a lie; she&#65533;s so caught up with trying to be a Donna Stone/Carol Brady that she&#65533;s forgotten who she really is.  All of which is about to change with the arrival of her old friend, who like Marley with his chains, sweeps in unannounced bearing enlightenment.And enlightening it is for the audience, as well; but more than that, Dolman has crafted and delivered an enterprising, thoroughly infectious, engaging and entertaining film that sweeps you along with it, while making you laugh and think about some things at the same time.  It&#65533;s one that will be most appreciated, though, by those &#65533;mature&#65533; enough to be able to identify with Suzette and Vinnie; those with some &#65533;experience&#65533; under their belts.  There are elements here that will appeal to everyone, but decidedly, the real message of the film will be lost on a youthful audience, in general.  Dolman does provide another, and very succinct perspective, however, through Vinnie&#65533;s teenage daughters, Hannah (Erika Christensen) and Ginger (Eva Amurri), whom he places in situations to which everyone in the audience, young and old alike, will be able to relate.  So in the end, Dolman has something to say, he says it well, and pretty much covers all the bases in doing so.  He sets a good pace, and through his vibrant characters he displays some real insights into human nature.  All of which makes his film ring with a zeal for life and for living, and for a greater understanding of the human condition.With her portrayal of Vinnie in this film, Susan Sarandon once again demonstrates that she can more than hold her own with the best actors in the business.  There&#65533;s a defining moment in this film, when Vinnie realizes what she&#65533;s been doing in her life-- not that it&#65533;s &#65533;bad,&#65533; or anything she regrets, but that she&#65533;s been dishonest with her family, and especially with herself, about who she really is-- and you can see it in her eyes when it happens; the awareness, the sudden understanding and the instant acquiescence even before she reacts to it outwardly, and it&#65533;s brilliant.  It&#65533;s one of those rare cinematic &#65533;moments&#65533; that are absolutely real and transporting, albeit in their brevity (or maybe even because of it).  And it takes a truly gifted actor to create and capture such a moment, which says everything that needs to be said about Sarandon&#65533;s performance here.Goldie Hawn, meanwhile, is a total delight as Suzette.  Entirely convincing, she manages to create a character who is both elegant and trashy at the same time, and to whom she lends a quirky charm and earthiness, wherein lies Suzette&#65533;s real appeal.  Hawn and Sarandon play well off of one another, too, which makes a significant impact on the contrast between the up-tight and edgy person Vinnie has become and the grounded, free spirit Suzette will forever be.  Hawn ferrets out the complexities of her character and effectively intersperses moments of restraint amid Suzette&#65533;s generally exuberant effusiveness, which makes for a complete package.  Interestingly enough, Suzette is effectively a look twenty years later at Penny Lane, the character Hawn&#65533;s real life daughter, Kate Hudson, played in &#65533;Almost Famous.&#65533;  It&#65533;s as if Hawn and Hudson have struck a vein of gold; Hudson was nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal of Penny, and with Suzette, Goldie Hawn gives one of her best, most mature and memorable performances ever.Geoffrey Rush also gives a performance of note, as Harry, a twenty year aspiring Hollywood screen writer who has finally thrown in the towel and is heading home to Phoenix to settle some scores and exorcise some personal demons.Christensen, and especially Amurri (Sarandon&#65533;s real life daughter) give convincing performances, as well, as does Robin Thomas as Raymond, Lavinia&#65533;s husband.  Entertaining and insightful, more than anything else, &#65533;The Banger Sisters&#65533; points up the importance &#65533;knowing thyself,&#65533; understanding who we are as individuals, and living accordingly; a philosophy one would be wise to embrace.  And that&#65533;s the magic of the movies.",5,"""Bang"" Up Performances by Hawn and Sarandon",1033603200,"10 3, 2002",2002,6291,"['go', 'business', 'living', 'life', 'matter', 'who', 'are', 'where',

602496,A158U96GCWKBJJ,B00005JLNZ,Robin L. McLaughlin,"[4, 4]","I love this film. I tend to rate movies by how well they accomplish what they set out to do. Schindler's List is trying to do something much different than Fried Green Tomatoes, and they need to be rated on their own merits. In this case, The Banger Sisters deftly accomplishes what it's meant to do, and that's to provide a heart-warming, funny movie about friendship, with a bit of nostalgia thrown in for flavor.I hadn't even heard of The Banger Sisters until I saw it for sale on the used rack at the local video store and picked it up because it had Susan Sarandon in it, a long time favorite of mine. Because I didn't know anything about it, I had zero expectations as to plot or movie quality, which sometimes helps. I ended up being totally charmed and have watched it several times and will surely watch it several more.The movie has a lot to say about how people change, or don't change, how a person can lose her sense of self, how raising children has some inherent hypocrisy involved, and about how important friends are to our identities. But these are all said subtly and just add a bit of background depth to what is namely a light comedy about old friends.The performances by Hawn and Sarandon are outstanding. As is the performance by Geoffry Rush. The three characters are all uniquely different, and yet somehow the three of them manage to make a wonderful and crazily believable whole. The fourth best performance in the movie is turned in by the fantastic soundtrack.So maybe while not a movie for deep thinkers or for elite cinema buffs, it's a wonderful way to spend an hour and a half for those who love movies about the bonds of friendship, who like a bit of nostalgia for the great days of rock and roll, and who appreciate a suprise, side-splittingly funny scene or turn of phrase now and then.",4,Groovy Movie,1160352000,"10 9, 2006",2006,1822,"['love', 'film', 'tend', 'rate', 'movies', 'how', 'well', 'accomplish', 'what', 'set', 'out', 'do', 'Schindler', 'List', 'trying', 'do', 'something', 'much', 'different', 'Fried', 'Green', 'Tomatoes', 'need', 'be', 'rated', 'own', 'merits', 'case', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'deftly', 'what', 'meant', 'do', 'provide', 'heart-warming', 'funny', 'movie', 'friendship', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'thrown', 'flavor.I', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'heard', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'saw', 'sale', 'used', 'rack', 'local', 'video', 'store', 'picked', 'up', 'had', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'long', 'time', 'favorite', 'mine', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'anything', 'had', 'zero', 'expectations', 'plot', 'movie', 'quality', 'sometimes', 'ended', 'up', 'being', 'totally', 'charmed', 'have', 'watched', 'several', 'times', 'will', 'surely', 'watch', 'several', 'more.The', 'movie', 'lot', 'say', 'how', 'people', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'change', 'how', 'person', 'can', 'lose', 'sense', 'self', 'how', 'raising', 'children', 'inherent', 'hypocrisy', 'involved', 'how', 'important', 'friends', 'are', 'identities', 'are', 'said', 'subtly', 'just', 'add', 'bit', 'background', 'depth', 'what', 'namely', 'light', 'comedy', 'old', 'friends.The', 'performances', 'Hawn', 'Sarandon', 'are', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Geoffry', 'Rush', 'three', 'characters', 'are', 'uniquely', 'different', 'yet', 'somehow', 'three', 'manage', 'make', 'wonderful', 'crazily', 'believable', 'whole', 'fourth', 'best', 'performance', 'movie', 'turned', 'fantastic', 'soundtrack.So', 'maybe', 'not', 'movie', 'deep', 'thinkers', 'elite', 'cinema', 'buffs', 'wonderful', 'way', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'who', 'love', 'movies', 'bonds', 'friendship', 'who', 'bit', 'nostalgia', 'great', 'days', 'rock', 'roll', 'who', 'appreciate', 'suprise', 'side-splittingly', 'funny', 'scene', 'turn', 'phrase', 'now', 'then']",The Banger Sisters

I have six young sons, and nothing gives me greater pleasure than to get cozy on my huge sofa with my popcorn and coca-cola, after everybody's is tucked in for the night, and enjoy some quiet time with a great dvd. Sadly, this movie was a bitter disappointment. I think Susan Sarandon is a wonderful actress, and Goldie Hawn has had her moments (Overboard). Without going into the details of the film, I will try to concentrate my review on the elements of the film. When I excitedly hit the play button, which I was sure would open the door to a whole new soon-to-be favorite film, I was smiling and kept smiling hoping that each line would bring something to smile about. I soon discovered my face hurt from trying to hold my once geniune smile turned phony. I finally had to tell myself that the movie wasn't funny or touching or even well-acted. Goldie's Suzette possessed not one solitary trait that was even remotely endearing. Watching Geoffrey Rush's character, Harry, become ""touched"" while Suzette allowed Vinnie's (Susan Sarandon) daughter to puke all over her while she soothed her through her bad acid trip, was just plain silly. I felt myself feeling embarrassed for the actors. If Goldie Hawn didn't go home from shooting this film every night with a pounding headache or throwing her back out, I would be very surprised. There is no way that anyone could keep their lips pursed like that without some repercussion. And voguing one's boobs sideways, backways, and every way to Sunday can't be good on one's back.  There was no ""feel good"" message, ""no moral"" to this waste of film. Those who have given ""The Banger Sisters"" a glowing review are clearly people who are ""low maintenance"" as far as movies go. They are not dazzled by gripping performances or an intelligent script. Two qualities I always look for. I guess if I am going to devote my valuable free time to watching a movie, it will have to be one worth watching and not this kind of slop. Hey, these people get paid millions of dollars to entertain. Shouldn't they have to earn it?  I could go on and on and on about all that is wrong with this movie, but I won't. Too much time has been wasted already. If you feel as if you want to give this movie a chance, I would strongly urge you to rent it, or better yet, borrow it from someone who owns it.

Not to mention, it has some very good names as stars. Geoffrey Rush, Susan Sarandon, and the indomitable Goldie Hawn. Plus, there are a lot of lesser names who deliver some great performances.The story begins with Suzette (Hawn) as a fun living, carefree former groupie still caught in the fast living of her younger days. She decides to visit her best friend, Livinia, (Sarandon) who is now a matronly, slighty hysterical mother trying to raise two spoiled children in the suburbs of Arizona with her rich lawyer husband.During Suzette's trip from Los Angeles, she meets Harold (Rush) who is on his way home to kill his father. Suzette takes this information in stride and it is hilarious how Harold takes to Suzette and her philosphy of life.What follows from there is a funny and introspective trip down memory lane and life's interesting paths. Personally, I like the movie. It's funny and you can watch it with family and friends alike. There is a great message being bandied about, and doesn't take long before you are caught up in the lives of everyone on screen.In an age of deep, riveting movies this is one you can watch with a smile and a laugh--not worrying if you missed the meaning. Plus, the added benefits of seeing a role designed for older actresses is a highlight in itself.I would highly recommend buying this movie.

602501,AZBMTXXNPS6YD,B00005JLNZ,"Subauthor ""jeffgonsalves dot com""","[4, 6]","I feel compelled to review this movie because it has such burgeoning star talent and yet failed on many levels. The characters are all pretty irritating, from Susan Sarandon's stuffy, prissy housewife to Goldie Hawn's sulking, expired sex diva to Geoffrey Rush's neurotic, aimless writer. The characters seemed cut-and-paste and the resolution to legitimate problems too pat and insulting. The idea of a suicidal author who has years-old writer's block and suddenly is overwhelmed with ideas and narrative drive simply because he got... by Goldie is amazingly contrived. And Sarandon morphing back into her hippie persona after years of being a socialite simply wasn't very invigorating (probably because her change wasn't for the better). Her identity crisis and subsequent constume change spurred familial conflict that was never dealt with. Uptight, repressed mother suddenly became groupie goddess and the daughters and husband looked on in shock, but did they ever really deal with her need to be herself? All of a sudden they were okay with the fact that she had tousled hair, giggled at nude photos of private parts, and toked on a reefer, probably because the end was near and some resolution had to take place. The predictable speech at the end about ""being true to you"" was neither profound or hard-earned--it was a cliche. Honestly, I found Goldie's character to be sad and gloomy--a wilted flower bathed in polluted rain. How she inspired others to break out of their shells is a mystery I won't try to solve--or maybe I'm just underestimating the power of Hollywood to resurrect a star and have everyone believe she is capable of changing lives in bed or on the dance floor. As for comedy, the biggest laugh I had was when Geoffrey Rush dances around his typewriter to music he couldn't possibly hear--his movements reminded me of a man responding to internal stimuli who is frantically trying to hush the voices...a sensation shared by the viewer of this film...",2,"These ""sisters"" need to be banged upside the head!",1034985600,"10 19, 2002",2002,1976,"['feel', 'compelled', 'review', 'movie', 'such', 'burgeoning', 'star', 'talent', 'yet', 'failed', 'many', 'levels', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'irritating', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'stuffy', 'prissy', 'housewife', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'sulking', 'expired', 'sex', 'diva', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'neurotic', 'aimless', 'writer', 'characters', 'seemed', 'cut-and-paste', 'resolution', 'legitimate', 'problems', 'too', 'pat', 'insulting', 'idea', 'suicidal', 'author', 'who', 'years-old', 'writer', 'block', 'suddenly', 'overwhelmed', 'ideas', 'narrative', 'drive', 'simply', 'got', 'Goldie', 'amazingly', 'contrived', 'Sarandon', 'morphing', 'back', 'hippie', 'persona', 'years', 'being', 'socialite', 'simply', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'invigorating', 'probably', 'change', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'identity', 'crisis', 'subsequent', 'constume', 'change', 'spurred', 'familial', 'conflict', 'was', 'never', 'dealt', 'Uptight', 'repressed', 'mother', 'suddenly', 'became', 'groupie', 'goddess', 'daughters', 'husband', 'looked', 'shock', 'did', 'ever', 'really', 'deal', 'need', 'be', 'sudden', 'were', 'okay', 'fact', 'had', 'tousled', 'hair', 'giggled', 'nude', 'photos', 'private', 'parts', 'toked', 'reefer', 'probably', 'end', 'was', 'resolution', 'had', 'take', 'place', 'predictable', 'speech', 'end', 'being', 'true', 'was', 'profound', 'hard-earned', 'was', 'cliche', 'Honestly', 'found', 'Goldie', 'character', 'be', 'sad', 'gloomy', 'wilted', 'flower', 'bathed', 'polluted', 'rain', 'How', 'inspired', 'others', 'break', 'shells', 'mystery', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'solve', 'maybe', ""'m"", 'just', 'underestimating', 'power', 'Hollywood', 'resurrect', 'star', 'have', 'everyone', 'believe', 'capable', 'changing', 'lives', 'bed', 'dance', 'floor', 'comedy', 'biggest', 'laugh', 'had', 'was', 'when', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'typewriter', 'music', 'could', ""n't"", 'possibly', 'hear', 'movements', 'reminded', 'man', 'responding', 'internal', 'stimuli', 'who', 'frantically', 'trying', 'hush', 'voices', 'sensation', 'shared', 'viewer', 'film']",The Banger Sisters

602504,A3R2M6DGECQOO,B00005JLNZ,Terrie,"[13, 20]","I am giving this film three stars because it's a treat to see Goldie Hawn and Susan Sarandon on the screen no matter what they're doing, but three stars is incredibly generous. This story is ostensibly about ""living true"" in other words not selling out and remaining true to yourself throughout your life. Not a bad moto to live by, but the way it is presented in this movie is pretty absurd. It starts out with Goldie Hawn as Suzette, basically a hard-drinking, sleep-around former groupie who has aged and never grown up.  We find Suzette still tending bar at the Whisky Ago-go in Hollywood where she's been since Jim Morrison of the Doors passed out in the bathroom there in the '60s and she was under him. New management has decided that Suzette is obsolete and fire her, so with no money and no place to go, no family or any real friends she heads out for Arizona to look up her old pal, Vin, from the good ol' drugs, alcohol, and casual sex days, when Frank Zappa had dubbed the two of them the Banger Sisters because of their notoriety as groupie party animals. They haven't been in contact for the past 20 years. Enroute, Suzette meets up with pathetic sad-sack Harry played by Geoffrey Rush who is heading home to Phoenix after a life-time of defeat in following his dreams as a writer. He has some dire plans to carry out and is utterly neurotic. A totally improbable relationship insues. Vin or Vinnie who now goes by her real name of Lavinia has become a totally straight, rich society woman with two spoiled teenaged daughters and a distant lawyer husband with political aspirations.  She lives in total luxury but is living a very flat and uninteresting existance that does not fulfill her in any way, let alone make her happy.Long story short, Suzette's appearance upsets the apple-carts in both Harry and Lavinia's lives. The daughters are blown away to find out their mom was once ""cool"" and that she is a real person with real feelings.Goldie's character is really defined by her outrageous wardrobe and her large fake breasts which are mentioned every few minutes or so and the role doesn't give her much opportunity to act.  We see nothing new from Goldie in this picture and there is no real depth to the character. Susan Sarandon's character has more depth and more for Susan to work with and she does the best that she can with the role but it is a very stereotypical woman that she is depicted as being, whether it's as a society lady or an over-aged groupie. Both Hawn and Sarandon look so good in their tight-fitting bar-fly costumes that it must have been alot of fun to play these characters.  These women are in such terrific shape and are such beauties in real life that it must have been a trip to camp it up like this and be able to pull it off. Unfortunately, their looks are the only hot thing about this movie...period. The moral of the story, ""Live True"", is put forth in such a cheesy way that even for this fluff of a movie it comes off as a disappointingly contrived message. The characters of the daughters, played adequately by Eva Anurri who seems like she could have done something with a fuller character and Erika Christensen who is lack-luster are so one-dimentional they did not elicite any emotional response from me.  Geoffrey Rush's Harry was probably the best played character in the movie, but once again, even great actors can only do so much with unbelievable characters. I was left with the feeling that the writers' had really confused the idea of being true to oneself with the idea of having no self-control or responsibility. Some of the ridiculous excursions down Memory Lane that Suzette and Vin indulge in are proof positive of this, but I won't spoil the movie by pointing any of them out. I would only recommed this movie to VERY die-hard fans of Hawn, Sarandon, and/or Rush. The story is pure drivel and as someone who was around back in the day when Jim Morrison was doing his thing and the Whisky was rockin' full tilt and nobody knew about AIDS, I can assure you that anyone from that era who is still living like that is NOT ""living true"" but probably has one foot in the grave and a life-time of memories full of despair and pain. You can only paint a rosey glow of nostalgia around so much and this movie doesn't pull it off.",3,Living True Is Not the Opposite of Growing Up,1032825600,"09 24, 2002",2002,4296,"['am', 'giving', 'film', 'three', 'stars', 'treat', 'see', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'screen', 'matter', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'three', 'stars', 'incredibly', 'generous', 'story', 'ostensibly', 'living', 'true', 'other', 'words', 'not', 'selling', 'out', 'remaining', 'true', 'yourself', 'life', 'Not', 'bad', 'moto', 'live', 'way', 'presented', 'movie', 'pretty', 'absurd', 'out', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Suzette', 'basically', 'hard-drinking', 'sleep-around', 'former', 'groupie', 'who', 'aged', 'never', 'grown', 'up', 'find', 'Suzette', 'still', 'tending', 'bar', 'Whisky', 'Ago-go', 'Hollywood', 'where', 'been', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'Doors', 'passed', 'out', 'bathroom', 'there', ""'60s"", 'was', 'New', 'management', 'decided', 'Suzette', 'obsolete', 'fire', 'so', 'money', 'place', 'go', 'family', 'real', 'friends', 'out', 'Arizona', 'look', 'up', 'old', 'pal', 'Vin', 'good', 'ol', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'casual', 'sex', 'days', 'when', 'Frank', 'Zappa', 'had', 'dubbed', 'two', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'notoriety', 'groupie', 'party', 'animals', 'have', ""n't"", 'been', 'contact', 'past', '20', 'years', 'Enroute', 'Suzette', 'up', 'pathetic', 'sad-sack', 'Harry', 'played', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'who', 'heading', 'home', 'Phoenix', 'life-time', 'defeat', 'following', 'dreams', 'writer', 'dire', 'plans', 'carry', 'out', 'utterly', 'neurotic', 'totally', 'improbable', 'relationship', 'insues', 'Vin', 'Vinnie', 'who', 'now', 'real', 'name', 'Lavinia', 'become', 'totally', 'straight', 'rich', 'society', 'woman', 'two', 'spoiled', 'teenaged', 'daughters', 'distant', 'lawyer', 'husband', 'political', 'aspirations', 'total', 'luxury', 'living', 'very', 'flat', 'uninteresting', 'existance', 'not', 'fulfill', 'way', 'let', 'alone', 'make', 'happy.Long', 'story', 'short', 'Suzette', 'appearance', 'apple-carts', 'Harry', 'Lavinia', 'lives', 'daughters', 'are', 'blown', 'away', 'find', 'out', 'mom', 'was', 'once', 'cool', 'real', 'person', 'real', 'feelings.Goldie', 'character', 'really', 'defined', 'outrageous', 'wardrobe', 'large', 'fake', 'breasts', 'are', 'mentioned', 'few', 'minutes', 'so', 'role', ""n't"", 'give', 'much', 'opportunity', 'act', 'see', 'nothing', 'new', 'Goldie', 'picture', 'real', 'depth', 'character', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'character', 'more', 'depth', 'more', 'Susan', 'work', 'best', 'can', 'role', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'woman', 'depicted', 'being', 'society', 'lady', 'over-aged', 'groupie', 'Hawn', 'Sarandon', 'look', 'so', 'good', 'tight-fitting', 'bar-fly', 'costumes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'alot', 'fun', 'play', 'characters', 'women', 'are', 'such', 'terrific', 'shape', 'are', 'such', 'beauties', 'real', 'life', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'trip', 'camp', 'up', 'be', 'able', 'pull', 'off', 'Unfortunately', 'looks', 'are', 'only', 'hot', 'thing', 'movie', 'period', 'moral', 'story', 'Live', 'True', 'put', 'forth', 'such', 'cheesy', 'way', 'even', 'fluff', 'movie', 'off', 'disappointingly', 'contrived', 'message', 'characters', 'daughters', 'played', 'adequately', 'Eva', 'Anurri', 'who', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'something', 'fuller', 'character', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'who', 'lack-luster', 'are', 'so', 'one-dimentional', 'did', 'not', 'elicite', 'emotional', 'response', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Harry', 'was', 'probably', 'best', 'played', 'character', 'movie', 'once', 'again', 'even', 'great', 'actors', 'can', 'only', 'do', 'so', 'much', 'unbelievable', 'characters', 'was', 'left', 'feeling', 'writers', 'had', 'really', 'confused', 'idea', 'being', 'true', 'oneself', 'idea', 'having', 'self-control', 'responsibility', 'ridiculous', 'excursions', 'down', 'Memory', 'Lane', 'Suzette', 'Vin', 'indulge', 'are', 'proof', 'positive', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'movie', 'pointing', 'would', 'only', 'recommed', 'movie', 'VERY', 'die-hard', 'fans', 'Hawn', 'Sarandon', 'and/or', 'Rush', 'story', 'pure', 'drivel', 'someone', 'who', 'was', 'around', 'back', 'day', 'when', 'Jim', 'Morrison', 'was', 'doing', 'thing', 'Whisky', 'was', 'rockin', 'full', 'tilt', 'nobody', 'knew', 'AIDS', 'can', 'assure', 'anyone', 'era', 'who', 'still', 'living', 'NOT', 'living', 'true', 'probably', 'one', 'foot', 'grave', 'life-time', 'memories', 'full', 'despair', 'pain', 'can', 'only', 'paint', 'rosey', 'glow', 'nostalgia', 'so', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'pull', 'off']",The Banger Sisters

Yes, young people might not know that, but she won Oscar for &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; back in 1969.  It's been a long time, you see, but here's good news for her fans; Goldie Hawn is back with a terrific performance as Suzette, ex-groupie of rock bands in the 60s.Suzette, after losing her job at a bar, goes to her old friend (and ex-groupie too) Vinnie played by Sarandon.  On her way to Pheonix where Vinnie lives, she picks up a down-and-out screenwriter Geoffrey Rush, and this incongrous pair will stumble into the now quiet life of Vinnie, aka Lavinia, now a respectable member of the community there, hiding all her wild past in her closet.  Obviously embarrassed Lavinia tries to chase her old  friend away, but soon they realize that the sweet memories of the past cannot be erased so easily.The story is thin, and sometimes the characters act inconsistently, but the charms of the gifted stars make up for the lack of originality.  The most remarkable part of the film is Goldie Hawn, whose CV in the 90s is not impressive at all.  Her free-spirited personality easily becomes a breezing presence which everyone would relate to, and most of all, she is very funny.  Equally good are Sarandon and Rush in their comic mood, especially Susan Sarandon who, I think, has recently played serious roles a bit too much.The film would be a really insipid mess without these talented people, and at least first time director Bob Dolman doesn't prevent them from doing their best.  I regret, however, that the film could have been much better with a tighter direction -- Rush's characterization loses power considerably in the second half -- and the roles of two young daughters of Vinnie (and her husband) could have been more interesting.  Interestingly, one of Vinnie's daughters is played by Eva Amurri, Susan Sarandon's real-life daughter (the other is played by Erika Christensen).  Sure, Ms. Amurri is really good (and resembles her mom -- see her eyes), but her role, or any roles for that matter, of &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot; have some room for improvement.After all, in the 90s, Goldie Hawn gave us Kate 'Penny Lane' Hudson.  But it is time for HER to be back in good shape, and &quot;The Banger Sisters&quot; would be a good start for the next decade.",3,Penny Lane 30 Years Later; Almost Fabulous Feel-Good Comedy,1056931200,"06 30, 2003",2003,2389,"['quot', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'three', 'Oscar', 'winners', 'said', 'three', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'Yes', 'young', 'people', 'might', 'not', 'know', 'won', 'Oscar', 'quot', 'Cactus', 'Flower', 'quot', 'back', '1969', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'see', 'here', 'good', 'news', 'fans', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'back', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Suzette', 'ex-groupie', 'rock', 'bands', '60s.Suzette', 'losing', 'job', 'bar', 'old', 'friend', 'ex-groupie', 'too', 'Vinnie', 'played', 'Sarandon', 'way', 'Pheonix', 'where', 'Vinnie', 'up', 'down-and-out', 'screenwriter', 'Geoffrey', 'Rush', 'incongrous', 'pair', 'will', 'stumble', 'now', 'quiet', 'life', 'Vinnie', 'aka', 'Lavinia', 'now', 'respectable', 'member', 'community', 'there', 'hiding', 'wild', 'past', 'closet', 'Obviously', 'embarrassed', 'Lavinia', 'tries', 'chase', 'old', 'friend', 'away', 'soon', 'realize', 'sweet', 'memories', 'past', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'erased', 'so', 'easily.The', 'story', 'thin', 'sometimes', 'characters', 'act', 'inconsistently', 'charms', 'gifted', 'stars', 'make', 'up', 'lack', 'originality', 'most', 'remarkable', 'part', 'film', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'CV', '90s', 'not', 'impressive', 'free-spirited', 'personality', 'easily', 'breezing', 'presence', 'everyone', 'would', 'relate', 'most', 'very', 'funny', 'Equally', 'good', 'are', 'Sarandon', 'Rush', 'comic', 'mood', 'especially', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'who', 'think', 'recently', 'played', 'serious', 'roles', 'bit', 'too', 'much.The', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'insipid', 'mess', 'talented', 'people', 'least', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'Bob', 'Dolman', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'doing', 'best', 'regret', 'however', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'tighter', 'direction', 'Rush', 'characterization', 'power', 'considerably', 'second', 'half', 'roles', 'two', 'young', 'daughters', 'Vinnie', 'husband', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'interesting', 'Interestingly', 'one', 'Vinnie', 'daughters', 'played', 'Eva', 'Amurri', 'Susan', 'Sarandon', 'real-life', 'daughter', 'other', 'played', 'Erika', 'Christensen', 'Sure', 'Ms.', 'Amurri', 'really', 'good', 'mom', 'see', 'eyes', 'role', 'roles', 'matter', 'quot', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'have', 'room', 'improvement.After', '90s', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'gave', 'Kate', 'Lane', 'Hudson', 'time', 'HER', 'be', 'back', 'good', 'shape', 'quot', 'Banger', 'Sisters', 'quot', 'would', 'be', 'good', 'start', 'next', 'decade']",The Banger Sisters

602508,A1SPB225CVTRUU,B00005JLNZ,"Wing Lee ""filmfan""","[0, 2]","It's a treat to see Goldie Hawn play a not-to-growup ex-groupie of the 60s and '70s along with the already grown up and settled down mother(Susan Sarandon) who used to party around in the good old days of Rock and Roll's golden years. This movie reminds me of Sarandon's high-octane Thelma and Louise, because it's also about the friendship of two women that are very different in personality. By the way, did Hawn have any influence on Kate Hudson's brilliant performance in Almost Famous? They both play the role of a groupie in almost the same year.This film is about the reunion of Hawn and Sarandon, and how over the course of a few decades the former best friends have gone total separate paths that they no longer feel the same kind of connection they did when they were wild and sexy in their groupie days. Time hasn't changed things for Hawn, and she still dressed like a 25 year-old, and behaves like one. She works as a bartentress and actually got fired. She had to find Sarandon for some favors, and to her surprise, Sarandon has changed a great deal. She's married with teenaged kids, has a career, a good husband and forgot about the good old groupie years. She's moved on. So things really go haywired when the two Sisters tried to reconnect.....The script is kind of weak, but it's very enjoyable to watch Hawn and Sarandon. Goldie had a lot of fun in this movie and she steals most of the scenes from Sarandon and Geoffrey Rush.
