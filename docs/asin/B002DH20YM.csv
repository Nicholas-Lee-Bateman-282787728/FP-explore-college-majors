One or two of the plots were rather strange, but overall the script and acting are excellent, and the show is never lacking in that clever British wit. Richard Greene is not the devil-may-care, Errol Flynn-type Robin Hood; instead, he's more of a strategist, trying to figure out the foppish Sheriff's next move. And with such a likeable band of Merry Men as the hot-headed Little John, the scholarly Friar Tuck, and the diminutive Derwent - along with, of course, the lovely Lady Marian - Robin Hood is sure to always end each adventure in triumph. This is a show which, despite its age, I guarantee the whole family will enjoy. (P.S. Never judge an episode by it's title.

1263445,AAVLB0GGEKRCO,B002DH20YM,Andrew Raker,"[12, 13]","My 5-star rating takes into consideration (1) other television programs during the same time period and (2) how well the programs teach moral/ethical values, in a way that is not 'preachy' to children.I would emphasize that these episodes are aimed toward children, and therefore adults with IQs over 120 might find these episodes tedious.Each episodes is approximately 25 minutes. Episodes were interesting, humorous, and well-written. While not overly intelligent, they make much better television entertainment than most shows on TV today in terms of values.Therefore, I would recommend this collection for individuals with children who dislike the TV programs (for children) today. These Robin Hood episodes do teach values to children and should be interesting. [For example: I have a brother in 4th grade who detests BBC classics like Pride & Prejudice, Bleak House, Oliver Twist, etc. However, he loved these episodes of Robin Hood.]Of course, the episodes are black and white, and the special effects are quite poor. (ex: The actor who plays Little John wears wears shoes with about 10 inch soles to make him appear taller.) However, I do not really believe the lack of special effects harmed these episodes.Also, if you wish, you watch many episodes on YouTube to see and hear for yourself before purchasing.However, at over 3,000 minutes, I believe this collection is certainly a good deal.Also recommended:Ronald Howard and H.

1263447,A3UUF0T87UNS9R,B002DH20YM,argytunes,"[2, 2]","There have been several versions of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD.  You can find the story in at least a half dozen live action films...a Disney animated Classic...as well as a version that is UNRATED!  But to be perfectly honest, NOTHING surpasses the 1955-1959 Television Show starring Richard Greene.  Millcreek Entertainment originally released the first 3 seasons in separate volumns.  I purchased Volumn 1 which contained the Origin of Robin Hood, his encounters with Little John, Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, and The Sheriff of Nottingham.  But after 39 episodes and a few too many glasses of mulled wine, I wanted more!  So in 2009, I discovered that Millcreek Entertainment had ALL 143 Episodes available on extended DVD discs.While Richard Greene portrayed Robin throughout the entire series, there were a few cast changes---including Lady Marian (Bernadette O'Farrell to Patricia Driscoll) as well as an alternate Little John (for Archie Duncan) in about 6 shows.  Alan Wheatley...who portrayed the Sheriff of Nottingham...seems to be missing during the final 2 seasons. But just about every other actor is consistant...including Ian Hunter who portrays the part of King Richard, The Lionhearted in several episodes. [Don't confuse this portrayal with 1939's ""Tower of London"" where Ian played the not-so-nice King Richard].Now the technical stuff.  Before the series went into syndication, there were designated sponsors that got a ""brought to you by.."" during the opening and closing credits.  How many men reading this remember using Wildroot Cream Oil on their hair? Or Johnson & Johnson's Band-Aid Plastic Strips? Or Johnson & Johnson's First Aid Cream?  There's a plug for one or more of these products in some of the episodes.  It's too bad Millcreek couldn't have left one commercial in the middle of these sponsored episodes...simply because it's always fun to watch ""the stars of tomorrow"" pitching a commercial product!Potential buyers reading this should understand that most of the material came from film stock.  So the quality of some of the episodes will vary.  The program was originally shot in black and white at Shepperton Studios in England...and then flown to the USA via Pan American Airlines!  I remember CBS airing the show at 7:30pm on Monday evenings. [This was back in the 1950s when the networks were responsible for 4 hours of programming per night--following the 6:30pm half-hour newscasts]. So you're going to notice an occasional splice or dark spot.  But if you can cope with those minor defects...FOLLOW ROBIN'S ARROW TO A WONDERFUL TV SERIES!

Produced in England, and starring every kid's second favorite ""Outlaw of Sherwood"", Richard Greene (and he was a VERY close second to Errol Flynn!), this four-season (1955-1960), half-hour series provided 143 episodes of humor, swordplay, and the kind of adventure we all dreamed of. It spawned a fan club that encompassed two continents and thousands of youthful members, made Mr. Greene a VERY wealthy man, and, surprisingly, holds up quite well, over 50 years later!Truthfully, there are technical problems with this collection; the episode quality ranges from unremastered and scratchy, to poorly remastered and tinted in blue; some episodes are repeated on different discs; and some are out of sequence (the 'Richard of the Lea' episodes featuring the 1938 Errol Flynn film's 'King Richard', Ian Hunter, are very mixed-up and a bit confusing). But the collection is still quite watchable (with improved picture quality in later seasons), and the price is amazingly affordable...and deserves five stars!Shot on a very tight budget, the program had a 'stock company' of supporting actors, who would play different roles each episode; over the course of the series, Maid Marian would be portrayed by two different actresses (Bernadette O'Farrell, then Patricia Driscoll); there would also be very brief substitutions of Little John and Will Scarlett, although the lion's share of episodes featured Archie Duncan and Paul Eddington in the roles. Two wonderful actors became fan favorites; Alexander Gauge, as a corpulent, very witty Friar Tuck, and Alan Wheatley, oozing villainy as the Sheriff of Nottingham. The series also offered a rising generaton of young British stars, early in their careers, including Donald Pleasance (who occasionally appeared as Prince John), Billie Whitelaw, Ian Bannen, Leo McKern, Jane Asher, Nigel Davenport, Anne Reid, Gordon Jackson, Edward Mulhare, Lawrence Naismith, Charles Gray, Desmond Llewellyn, Michael Gough, Nigel Green, Gary Raymond, Edward Judd, and many more. The talent behind the camera was top-notch, as well, with respected directors like Lindsay Anderson, Don Chaffey, and Hammer Films legend, Terence Fisher, and writers, including Ring Lardner, Jr., Howard Dimsdale, and Jan Read.Many episodes of the series carried on the Hollywood (and literary) tradition of Robin defending England for King Richard, while defying the ambitions of Prince John, with a bit more 'bite' than earlier incarnations; producer Hannah Weinstein, an expatriate American in England to avoid the McCarthy 'witchhunts', encouraged blacklisted American writers to join her in England, and pen scripts condemning political, religious, or scientific repression by Prince John and his minions; other episodes were straightforward morality tales, often humorous but occasionally more serious, some of which were, in fact, based on the Robin Hood ballads of Medieval England, giving the series a sense of authenticity many other series have lacked, and a timeless universal appeal for generations of viewers!This series is a joy, one that I have truly enjoyed revisiting over a half-century after their initial broadcast, and can highly recommend for children and adults, today!",5,"Uneven Quality and Presentation, but Fabulous Price for Series!",1302048000,"04 6, 2011",2011,3587,"['baby', 'boomer', 'was', 'fortunate', 'see', 'emergence', 'television', '1950s', 'may', 'refer', ""'Golden"", 'Age', 'live', 'drama', 'comedy', 'kids', 'knew', 'better', 'was', 'REALLY', ""'Golden"", 'Age', 'syndicated', 'adventure', 'series', 'geared', 'likeAdventures', 'Superman', 'Roy', 'Rogers', 'Dale', 'Evans', 'ESPECIALLY', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Complete', 'Series', 'Produced', 'England', 'starring', 'kid', 'second', 'favorite', 'Outlaw', 'Sherwood', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'was', 'VERY', 'close', 'second', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'four-season', '1955-1960', 'half-hour', 'series', 'provided', '143', 'episodes', 'humor', 'swordplay', 'kind', 'adventure', 'dreamed', 'spawned', 'fan', 'club', 'encompassed', 'two', 'continents', 'thousands', 'youthful', 'members', 'made', 'Mr.', 'Greene', 'VERY', 'wealthy', 'man', 'surprisingly', 'up', 'quite', 'well', '50', 'years', 'later', 'Truthfully', 'are', 'technical', 'problems', 'collection', 'episode', 'quality', 'unremastered', 'scratchy', 'poorly', 'remastered', 'tinted', 'blue', 'episodes', 'are', 'repeated', 'different', 'discs', 'are', 'sequence', ""'Richard"", 'Lea', 'episodes', 'featuring', '1938', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'film', ""'King"", 'Richard', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'are', 'very', 'mixed-up', 'bit', 'confusing', 'collection', 'still', 'quite', 'watchable', 'improved', 'picture', 'quality', 'later', 'seasons', 'price', 'amazingly', 'affordable', 'five', 'stars', 'Shot', 'very', 'tight', 'budget', 'program', 'had', ""'stock"", 'company', 'supporting', 'actors', 'who', 'would', 'play', 'different', 'roles', 'episode', 'course', 'series', 'Maid', 'Marian', 'would', 'be', 'portrayed', 'two', 'different', 'actresses', 'Bernadette', ""O'Farrell"", 'then', 'Patricia', 'Driscoll', 'would', 'also', 'be', 'very', 'brief', 'substitutions', 'Little', 'John', 'Will', 'Scarlett', 'lion', 'share', 'episodes', 'featured', 'Archie', 'Duncan', 'Paul', 'Eddington', 'roles', 'Two', 'wonderful', 'actors', 'became', 'fan', 'favorites', 'Alexander', 'Gauge', 'corpulent', 'very', 'witty', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'Alan', 'Wheatley', 'oozing', 'villainy', 'Sheriff', 'Nottingham', 'series', 'also', 'offered', 'rising', 'generaton', 'young', 'British', 'stars', 'early', 'careers', 'including', 'Donald', 'Pleasance', 'who', 'occasionally', 'appeared', 'Prince', 'John', 'Billie', 'Whitelaw', 'Ian', 'Bannen', 'Leo', 'McKern', 'Jane', 'Asher', 'Nigel', 'Davenport', 'Anne', 'Reid', 'Gordon', 'Jackson', 'Edward', 'Mulhare', 'Lawrence', 'Naismith', 'Charles', 'Gray', 'Desmond', 'Llewellyn', 'Michael', 'Gough', 'Nigel', 'Green', 'Gary', 'Raymond', 'Edward', 'Judd', 'many', 'more', 'talent', 'camera', 'was', 'top-notch', 'as', 'well', 'respected', 'directors', 'Lindsay', 'Anderson', 'Don', 'Chaffey', 'Hammer', 'Films', 'legend', 'Terence', 'Fisher', 'writers', 'including', 'Ring', 'Lardner', 'Jr.', 'Howard', 'Dimsdale', 'Jan', 'Read.Many', 'episodes', 'series', 'carried', 'Hollywood', 'literary', 'tradition', 'Robin', 'defending', 'England', 'King', 'Richard', 'defying', 'ambitions', 'Prince', 'John', 'bit', 'more', 'earlier', 'incarnations', 'producer', 'Hannah', 'Weinstein', 'expatriate', 'American', 'England', 'avoid', 'McCarthy', ""'witchhunts"", 'encouraged', 'blacklisted', 'American', 'writers', 'join', 'England', 'pen', 'scripts', 'condemning', 'political', 'religious', 'scientific', 'repression', 'Prince', 'John', 'minions', 'other', 'episodes', 'were', 'straightforward', 'morality', 'tales', 'often', 'humorous', 'occasionally', 'more', 'serious', 'were', 'fact', 'based', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'ballads', 'Medieval', 'England', 'giving', 'series', 'sense', 'authenticity', 'many', 'other', 'series', 'have', 'lacked', 'timeless', 'universal', 'appeal', 'generations', 'viewers', 'series', 'joy', 'one', 'have', 'truly', 'enjoyed', 'revisiting', 'half-century', 'initial', 'broadcast', 'can', 'highly', 'recommend', 'children', 'adults', 'today']",The Adventures of Robin Hood: The Complete Series

1263461,A36H16ZJXUIMZG,B002DH20YM,"Gene Cisco ""Moon Man""","[50, 52]","This TV series has hung in my memory over 40 years, obviously my first introduction to english culture, long before seeing Errol Flynn in the big screen version of Robin Hood. This is an early review of this series, mind you, before seeing the 90 or so remaining episodes. No matter. If you like ""I, Claudius, "" and ""Poldark,"" you must see this wonderful black-and-white introduction to the British standards of locale/studio dramatizations. With adult eyes, I am amazed at the way the writers avoided trampling the Hollywood scene cliches to this fable, realizing they had more time to add depth and imagination to this Robin Hood, maintaining its plausability along the way. For instance, how did Robin gain leadership over the men of Sherwood Forest? He earned it, reluctantly, by displaying a deeper wisdom in proving himself. Having seen the early (1929)silent Fairbanks ""Robin Hood,"" shot in romantic hues of light and dark, with spare period furniture,it is apparent to me now that the British team of craftsmen may have had that in mind in their location shooting.The noblemen do speak more eloquently than the peasantry, but each has their code of honor or dishonor accordingly. If you have kids and would like to introduce them to the harmless myths like Robin Hood that will remain with them years later, this is a great introduction like Life 101. Episodes will pit greed against obligation; obligations to king or the gang; right versus might. Loyalty to the gang or the family. There is clearly a logic and rationale upon which each episode hangs. We are rational beings is what Robin Hood argues throughout and that right gets contested and we must be fit for that contest daily.There is a greater need for this moral fable today, wouldn't you agree? Richard Greene as this TV Robin Hood, makes clear from the start the importance of words, honor, loyalty; our priorities; and that they fit our actions in determining the outcome of our affairs. And, of course, 90 or so episodes later, we think we have viewed a harmless fable. After college, we call it philosophy without text-editing crib sheets. Of the many reasons to admire this series, the one most impressive is how well this series holds up to the TV period dramas 25 years later.",5,No Better Greene in Sherwood Forest,1263081600,"01 10, 2010",2010,2254,"['TV', 'series', 'hung', 'memory', '40', 'years', 'obviously', 'first', 'introduction', 'english', 'culture', 'long', 'seeing', 'Errol', 'Flynn', 'big', 'screen', 'version', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'early', 'review', 'series', 'seeing', '90', 'so', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'matter', 'Claudius', 'Poldark', 'must', 'see', 'wonderful', 'black-and-white', 'introduction', 'British', 'standards', 'locale/studio', 'dramatizations', 'adult', 'eyes', 'am', 'amazed', 'way', 'writers', 'avoided', 'trampling', 'Hollywood', 'scene', 'cliches', 'fable', 'realizing', 'had', 'more', 'time', 'add', 'depth', 'imagination', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'maintaining', 'plausability', 'way', 'instance', 'how', 'did', 'Robin', 'gain', 'leadership', 'men', 'Sherwood', 'Forest', 'earned', 'reluctantly', 'displaying', 'deeper', 'wisdom', 'proving', 'Having', 'seen', 'early', '1929', 'silent', 'Fairbanks', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'shot', 'romantic', 'hues', 'light', 'dark', 'spare', 'period', 'furniture', 'apparent', 'now', 'British', 'team', 'craftsmen', 'may', 'have', 'had', 'mind', 'location', 'shooting.The', 'noblemen', 'do', 'speak', 'more', 'eloquently', 'peasantry', 'code', 'honor', 'dishonor', 'accordingly', 'have', 'kids', 'would', 'like', 'introduce', 'harmless', 'myths', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'will', 'remain', 'years', 'later', 'great', 'introduction', 'Life', '101', 'Episodes', 'will', 'pit', 'greed', 'obligation', 'obligations', 'king', 'gang', 'right', 'versus', 'might', 'Loyalty', 'gang', 'family', 'clearly', 'logic', 'rationale', 'episode', 'hangs', 'are', 'rational', 'beings', 'what', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'right', 'contested', 'must', 'be', 'fit', 'contest', 'greater', 'need', 'moral', 'fable', 'today', 'would', ""n't"", 'agree', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'TV', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'clear', 'start', 'importance', 'words', 'honor', 'loyalty', 'priorities', 'fit', 'actions', 'determining', 'outcome', 'affairs', 'course', '90', 'so', 'episodes', 'later', 'think', 'have', 'viewed', 'harmless', 'fable', 'college', 'call', 'philosophy', 'text-editing', 'crib', 'sheets', 'many', 'reasons', 'admire', 'series', 'one', 'most', 'impressive', 'how', 'well', 'series', 'TV', 'period', '25', 'years', 'later']",The Adventures of Robin Hood: The Complete Series

1263470,A3FPNX050KIRAH,B002DH20YM,"Karen A. Langro ""AVID TV WATCHER""","[1, 1]","I really enjoy this series. Richard Greene is the only actor who comes very close to Eroyl Flynn as Robin Hood.  Until reading one persons review, I did'nt know that there was a hiatus, I'm quessing that's why a different actress played Maid Marion.  Not that I have any objections, I don't Patricia Driscolle is quite good in the role. The other actress for whatever reason was unavaiable.  It very likely had to do with that hiatus, she must have been doing something else, though the others like Alexander Gauge came back. I would have liked for the series to have closure.  Meaning that King Richard comes back, Robin's estates and wealth are restored, all of the rest of the merry men free, no longer outlaws.  And of course Robin Hood and Maid Marion marry and live happlily ever after!  Oh well, we all know that is what happens after the show went off the air. Of all the actors who played more than one role Paul Eddington played more different roles than the others.  And in the final season, season four on this 11 disc set, had a regular role as Will Scarlet. I recommend this TV show to everyone, add this to your DVD collection, you won't be sorry. This is a contuation of the above review, written earlier.  I sometimes read other reviews, to see what others think, and I find it quite interesting.  Like I'm not the only one who thinks that Richard Greene is the only one of all the other actors to play Robin Hood, who comes a very close second to Erroll Flynn in the role.  This DVD can even be viewed by today's kids, who in my view should'nt think it as dated, unlike the others, because this takes place during the middle ages.  Even though its produced for kids, it did'nt surgarcoat how things were during that time.  It should make us feel lucky that we live in the 21st century.  So much injustice, and the Lords of the Manor abusing right and left their power over the people who work the Lords land.  In one epsoide Friar Tuck, One Lord wants land that the other has, and agreed to marry him to the daughter of a man who worked on his land.  But while not a serf, she also is not his social equal, so marry her?  Oh well it's a show produced for kids so that had to be that way, and not the other one. Once more I recommend this TV show.  Sometimes like  the shows are not  in their proper air time, like the ones that Ian Hunter starring as Sir Richard of the Lea, two examples of not being constistn like this is in the Knight who comes to Dinner.  He had to get a loan from the abbott(a disgrace to his office) in order to get his son away because by accident he killed a son whose father is a crony of Prince John and they were going to have him arrested for murder.  So Sir RIchard used the loan to have him join in the fight in the Holy Land.  But in another one The Bethothal, his son loves music and is not a jouster.  But from the way he and his wife talked he is the only son.  Sir Richard needed to marry his son off so that he can pay his ransom when he lost a match.  Will always recommend this to others.  To one reviewer who said that in this Ian Hunter played King Richard, he did in the 1938 movie version of The Adventures of Robin Hood, but in this he played Sir Richard of the Lea.",5,"Karen, N.Y.",1303948800,"04 28, 2011",2011,3228,"['really', 'enjoy', 'series', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'only', 'actor', 'who', 'very', 'close', 'Eroyl', 'Flynn', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'reading', 'one', 'persons', 'review', ""did'nt"", 'know', 'was', 'hiatus', ""'m"", 'quessing', 'why', 'different', 'actress', 'played', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'Not', 'have', 'objections', 'do', ""n't"", 'Patricia', 'Driscolle', 'quite', 'good', 'role', 'other', 'actress', 'reason', 'was', 'unavaiable', 'very', 'likely', 'had', 'do', 'hiatus', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'doing', 'something', 'else', 'others', 'Alexander', 'Gauge', 'came', 'back', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'series', 'have', 'closure', 'Meaning', 'King', 'Richard', 'back', 'Robin', 'estates', 'wealth', 'are', 'restored', 'rest', 'merry', 'men', 'free', 'no', 'longer', 'outlaws', 'course', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'Maid', 'Marion', 'marry', 'live', 'happlily', 'ever', 'Oh', 'well', 'know', 'what', 'show', 'went', 'air', 'actors', 'who', 'played', 'more', 'one', 'role', 'Paul', 'Eddington', 'played', 'more', 'different', 'roles', 'others', 'final', 'season', 'season', 'four', '11', 'disc', 'set', 'had', 'regular', 'role', 'Will', 'Scarlet', 'recommend', 'TV', 'show', 'everyone', 'add', 'DVD', 'collection', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'sorry', 'contuation', 'above', 'review', 'written', 'earlier', 'sometimes', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'see', 'what', 'others', 'think', 'find', 'quite', 'interesting', ""'m"", 'not', 'only', 'one', 'who', 'Richard', 'Greene', 'only', 'one', 'other', 'actors', 'play', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'who', 'very', 'close', 'second', 'Erroll', 'Flynn', 'role', 'DVD', 'can', 'even', 'be', 'viewed', 'today', 'kids', 'who', 'view', ""should'nt"", 'think', 'dated', 'others', 'place', 'middle', 'ages', 'Even', 'produced', 'kids', 'surgarcoat', 'how', 'things', 'were', 'time', 'should', 'make', 'feel', 'lucky', 'live', '21st', 'century', 'So', 'much', 'injustice', 'Lords', 'Manor', 'abusing', 'right', 'left', 'power', 'people', 'who', 'work', 'Lords', 'land', 'one', 'epsoide', 'Friar', 'Tuck', 'One', 'Lord', 'land', 'other', 'agreed', 'marry', 'daughter', 'man', 'who', 'worked', 'land', 'not', 'serf', 'also', 'not', 'social', 'equal', 'so', 'marry', 'Oh', 'show', 'produced', 'kids', 'so', 'that', 'had', 'be', 'way', 'not', 'other', 'one', 'more', 'recommend', 'TV', 'show', 'Sometimes', 'shows', 'are', 'not', 'proper', 'air', 'time', 'ones', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'starring', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Lea', 'two', 'examples', 'not', 'being', 'constistn', 'Knight', 'who', 'Dinner', 'had', 'get', 'loan', 'abbott', 'disgrace', 'office', 'order', 'get', 'son', 'away', 'accident', 'killed', 'son', 'father', 'crony', 'Prince', 'John', 'were', 'going', 'have', 'arrested', 'murder', 'So', 'Sir', 'RIchard', 'used', 'loan', 'have', 'join', 'fight', 'Holy', 'Land', 'one', 'Bethothal', 'son', 'music', 'not', 'jouster', 'way', 'wife', 'talked', 'only', 'son', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'needed', 'marry', 'son', 'so', 'can', 'pay', 'ransom', 'when', 'lost', 'match', 'Will', 'always', 'recommend', 'others', 'one', 'reviewer', 'who', 'said', 'Ian', 'Hunter', 'played', 'King', 'Richard', 'did', '1938', 'movie', 'version', 'Adventures', 'Robin', 'Hood', 'played', 'Sir', 'Richard', 'Lea']",The Adventures of Robin Hood: The Complete Series

I did have Howard Pyle's classic novel ""The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood"" in one of those Whitman books you could buy from a display in a drug store. I thoroughly enjoyed reading that, but I have never seen any filmed versions of Robin Hood until now (not counting Mel Brooks' series ""When Things Were Rotten""). I was tempted to watch Kevin Costner's ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" but I never did because I suspected the story would be updated for modern prejudices much like Kevin Sorbo's ""Hercules,"" which one reviewer described as ""a surfer dude on his way to a Renaissance fair.""When I bought the complete first season of the Richard Greene series for five bucks at Wal-Mart, I figured it would be fun, not knowing that I would be both surprised and amazed at the quality of the acting, the writing, and the way it was filmed. I have since bought the complete four-year series. It really takes you back into a credible medieval atmosphere. It may have once been considered a kid's show, but it surely has kept the adults entertained around our house! It also brought back pleasant memories of a time in our culture when writers took romantic heroism seriously, and didn't have to turn everything into tongue-in-cheek ""camp.""In some circles today it is popular to criticize Robin Hood as the world's first socialist, because he ""robbed from the rich to give to the poor."" If that were true he would be an evil man. But this TV series sets the record straight by showing that Robin was an avenger of the poor, who only took from the rich what they had previously stolen and returned it to its rightful owners.And speaking of avengers, I was also a fan of the British television series ""The Avengers."" The women in that show, Catherine Gale, Emma Peel, and Tara King, all had respectable British properness, but underneath all that was this element of delicious mischief.

Half an hour later, I was wondering why I'd never seen this delight before.There are 143 episodes, and while not all are high art, they are all something you can share with the family, filled with the legendary Robin of Loxley and his Merry Men, Friar Tuck and Maid Marian, and a host of others living and fighting for the right to be free men and women, sometimes with bow and arrows, and once in a while, with the greatness of their intellects.Don't let the lack of vibrant color mislead you:  the vividness of the joy the actors have in their parts shines through quite pleasingly.

This is a great old-fashioned series which has aged very well. The stories are all nice little adventures that still play out quite well in the modern era. There is minimal violence and the actors are all very good in their roles. After watching all of the episodes, I'm impressed by the variety of stories that were told. Obviously, the endings are pretty happy, but that doesn't have to be seen as a bad thing.Note that the series is in black and white, and there is some sound volume and quality fluctuation, but nothing that makes it hard to understand or unwatchable.
