1348190,A16ZCVDIFWONW,B003KV3E2W,C. Loescher,"[3, 7]","Robert Angelo Masciantonio has created a film here that serious horror fans would call ""polarizing"" by definition, but given how bold ""polarizing"" sounds, I'm going to go with ""frustrating"" instead.  Some are toting this movie as yet another entry in the ""gorno"" genre, but I can't disagree more.  Hostel was everything that Neighbor was not:  suspenseful, disturbing, realistic (at least in terms of special effects), and though I hate the tag, a true entry in the ""gorno"" or ""torture porn"" subgenre.  Neighbor, by comparison, plays out like an expensive set piece created by a special effects student in dire need of an outlet for their creative frustration.Actress America Olivo pulls off a somewhat convincing performance as the titular character, who apparently has nothing better to do with her free time or psyche than torturing hapless victims to death in their own homes using various implements of pain and bloodletting.  The foundation of the plot centers around three mid-twentysomething men who, throughout the course of the movie, become inexplicably involved in the goings-on of America's character, known only in the viewer's mind as the ""Neighbor.""  Though the dialogue between both the men in their social circle, and between the men and their eventual torturer, are both somewhat believable, there is absolutely no motive behind what kinds of mindless brutality to which Olivo exposes the three victims (and others whom hold even less coherency to the plot).  Yes, there is gore, and plenty of it, but instead of feeling sympathy for the victims of ""the neighbor,"" I began to hope that she would just stop just so the movie will end.  The torture scenes are par at best, but given what appears to be an otherwise low-budget movie, could be described as apt.  Masciantonia obviously wants the viewer to be disturbed, sickened, and fearful of what they have seen, but due to the subtle excuse for mindless horror that is the so-called plot, I walk away feeling instead like a horror fan somehow ripped off yet again by the underground hype.Around the middle of the film, there is a short and brilliant sequence that went both backwards and forewards, as the primary victim attempted to come to terms with what was happening to him, but it was too brief and gave way to more of the tedious plot of the movie itself.  Horror fans, if you're looking for a mindless excuse to see the shite mimes of films like Hostel, look no further, but if you're looking for an affecting, brutal, and emotionally draining one, avoid the Neighbor.",2,Don't Believe the Hype,1310688000,"07 15, 2011",2011,2545,"['Robert', 'Angelo', 'Masciantonio', 'created', 'film', 'here', 'serious', 'horror', 'fans', 'would', 'call', 'polarizing', 'definition', 'given', 'how', 'bold', 'polarizing', ""'m"", 'going', 'go', 'frustrating', 'instead', 'are', 'toting', 'movie', 'yet', 'entry', 'gorno', 'genre', 'ca', ""n't"", 'disagree', 'more', 'Hostel', 'was', 'everything', 'Neighbor', 'was', 'not', 'suspenseful', 'disturbing', 'realistic', 'least', 'terms', 'special', 'effects', 'hate', 'tag', 'true', 'entry', 'gorno', 'torture', 'porn', 'subgenre', 'Neighbor', 'comparison', 'out', 'expensive', 'set', 'piece', 'created', 'special', 'effects', 'student', 'dire', 'need', 'outlet', 'creative', 'frustration.Actress', 'America', 'Olivo', 'somewhat', 'convincing', 'performance', 'titular', 'character', 'who', 'apparently', 'nothing', 'better', 'do', 'free', 'time', 'psyche', 'torturing', 'hapless', 'victims', 'death', 'own', 'homes', 'using', 'various', 'implements', 'pain', 'bloodletting', 'foundation', 'plot', 'centers', 'three', 'mid-twentysomething', 'men', 'who', 'course', 'movie', 'become', 'inexplicably', 'involved', 'goings-on', 'America', 'character', 'known', 'only', 'viewer', 'mind', 'Neighbor', 'dialogue', 'men', 'social', 'circle', 'men', 'eventual', 'torturer', 'are', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'absolutely', 'motive', 'what', 'kinds', 'mindless', 'brutality', 'Olivo', 'three', 'victims', 'others', 'whom', 'hold', 'even', 'less', 'coherency', 'plot', 'Yes', 'gore', 'plenty', 'instead', 'feeling', 'sympathy', 'victims', 'neighbor', 'began', 'hope', 'would', 'just', 'stop', 'just', 'so', 'movie', 'will', 'end', 'torture', 'scenes', 'are', 'par', 'best', 'given', 'what', 'be', 'otherwise', 'low-budget', 'movie', 'could', 'be', 'described', 'apt', 'Masciantonia', 'obviously', 'viewer', 'be', 'disturbed', 'sickened', 'fearful', 'what', 'have', 'seen', 'due', 'subtle', 'excuse', 'mindless', 'horror', 'so-called', 'plot', 'walk', 'away', 'feeling', 'instead', 'horror', 'fan', 'somehow', 'ripped', 'off', 'yet', 'again', 'underground', 'hype.Around', 'middle', 'film', 'short', 'brilliant', 'sequence', 'went', 'backwards', 'forewards', 'primary', 'victim', 'attempted', 'come', 'terms', 'what', 'was', 'happening', 'was', 'too', 'brief', 'gave', 'way', 'more', 'tedious', 'plot', 'movie', 'Horror', 'fans', ""'re"", 'looking', 'mindless', 'excuse', 'see', 'shite', 'mimes', 'films', 'Hostel', 'look', 'further', ""'re"", 'looking', 'affecting', 'brutal', 'emotionally', 'draining', 'one', 'Neighbor']",N/A

She does a genuinely good job playing a gal who will invade a house and use common household items, tools, chemicals, etc. to torture, maim and finally kill the inhabitants. She has genuine quirkiness in her delivery that makes the rest of this inept garbage nearly palatable.This is a torture movie plain and simple. There is no plot. There is no motive. She just does what she does for no apparent reason and dances away down the street at the end. So, you would figure they would put their money on the torture/gore scenes, but they couldn't even get that right. My guess is that the budget restricted them from doing a decent job, but even the make-up effects were inept. They got none of this right.This is a Canadian production and it looks as though it was put together by guys right out of film school. Almost all of the actors are within a couple years of age from one another. They probably hired all their friends. The directing, acting, effects were all lousy. The sound mixing was terrible. I was constantly adjusting the volume to either hear better or keep from being blasted out of my seat. The music was OK.

Somewhat close to ""SAW"" level for a, and you couldn't tell, low budget film. A slightly satirical and comedic portrayal of the neighbor you don't want to have. Also reminded me of the Hong Kong movie ""Dream Home"" where a young girl, growing up in a slum, does not lack for imagination in getting the Condo she's dreamed of having.What makes this movie a little different than countless others? The script was creative and novel in that the victims all were likable and the killer had a unique darkly comedic personality and her methods were a bit unusual. The special effects (props, prosthetics) were first rate and you could see that the care they took in creating them was so realistic that even the actors were cringing when viewing the editing scenes. Kudos to Vincent Gugstini for his efforts. My only criticism here would be that the blood wasn't quite the right viscosity and color. What really carries the film is the acting by America Olivo (as the Neighbor) who created a unique character - maniacal and darkly diabolical yet insanely charming and comical.

This movie is just about a young psychotic adult girl (America Olivo) who comes to a town and goes to different doors murdering people in all sorts of ways. Among her list of victims is an elderly lady who's cup of tea she had been poisoning for weeks, an adult man (I forget how he dies but she uses some sort of unique way to draw blood from him into a wine glass), a teenage girl who she attacks and kills by electrocuting her in a bathtub. However her biggest target is this guy named Don whom she tortures for what seems EVER! Once he lets her into his house, the fun begins for her. I won't say how she tortures him and his unfortunate friends, but among the instruments used are a hammer, a pizza cutter, fishing hooks, a drill, acid, fire, needles, a hacksaw, antifreeze, an instrument that will leave male viewers cringing in pain, and so much more!

For instance would someone really be electrocuted if a hair dryer were dropped into a bathtub full of water they were in? You get the picture.We move on to a group of friends that at one time were a garage band hoping to make it big. The leader of the group is Dan...at least I think that's his name...I've tried to wipe so much of this movie from my mind I'm not sure. Anyway, Dan has a girlfriend he's hoping to make up with while at the same time eyeing the local barmaid at the hangout this trio of friends frequents. It is there that he is spotted by ""the girl"".Of course she follows him home and somehow the next thing he finds is himself tied to a chair and ""the girl"" figuring out just what to do with him. How about for starters she digs the claw end of a hammer into his shin and pulls up on it? That way the special effects guy gets to introduce some nice gore into the film. Not enough? Then let's take that drill she was walking around with and drill through his big toe, all on camera.Bit by bit ""the girl"" tortures Dan over and over again with new ways to inflict pain upon him. So much so that he eventually escapes into his own mind, reliving many of the boring, mundane things we witnessed earlier. But then he returns for us to witness more torture.When his friends show up, none of them seem smart enough to take out the single psycho and they too become victims. Eventually even his girlfriend shows to be tortured with a particularly gruesome hacksaw across the mouth scene that will give normal people chills and gore fans orgasms.I just don't get the whole genre. I love horror films but never felt that these sorts of films fell into that category. I've considered them more for fans of special effects than of films. I've thought that the whole idea of horror in a film was taken too literally in these types, focusing on the most disgusting thing possible rather than the subtle type of terror that lasts with you for days and gets into your mind.Perhaps these films are homage to the drive in exploitation classics that featured gruesome gore in the past. But then even those films had a story. These seem made just to get the gore out there as cheaply and easily as possible. If that's all that matters to you, you'll love this movie. Otherwise you're wasting your time.SPOILER ALERTIf you don't want to waste the time with this movie, here is what happens. ""The girl"" tortures everyone she comes into contact with in the film. Dan was planning a party to celebrate the group and his friends all show at the end of the film and the party begins. All the while, the tortured bodies of the band are in the basement rec room. ""The girl"" walks among the guests and heads out, taking time to talk to a vapid young girl and then moving on, walking down the street to find her next victim. So with the exception of offering a bunch of gore effects, the film is basically pointless. Well until someone comes along and tries to explain the ""artistic merits"" of this film and the social implications offered that are metaphors for the real world.

Truly if Neighbor is anything, it is a whole lot of nothing strung together across a temporal divide of 90 minutes, that director Robert Angelo Masciantonio challenges you, the viewer to navigate without rolling your eyes or having a spasmodic twitch for the remote control to change the channel for something with more depth.  As for depth, this movie is one of the few perfectly existential films I've ever seen.  Truly it lives in the moment.  None of the characters need bothered to have had names, for they are just nothing (that word again!) more than meat for the protagonist; in fact, they might as well have been called Meat 1, Meat 2, etc.  As for the protagonist, America Olivo at first came across as very interesting.  Indeed, I was initially drawn in by her flighty, disjointed and even edgy performance.  Sadly, she got bit by that existential bug as well, because at no point is any freaking clue given as to why she does what she does.  Disagree if you will, but since she is the character that supposedly propels the story along, there should be some kind of reason moving her.  If there is no reason, you have no story, and if there is no story there is no point in watching--then it really is torture porn, but the torture is on the viewer for the lack of payoff.  Oh, that's the genius of the film?

Powers ""show maniac""","[4, 9]","Neighbor is a plotless movie that is strictly made to show a series of sadistic and horrifyingly systematic torture and slaughter of helpless victims.  The sadist is a young woman, obviously insane but no explanation is given who she is and why she is doing these unflinchingly depicted murders.  The unknown actress playing the role has to know this will be her first and last movie role because who in their right mind would ever hire her unless it was the Marquis DeSade.Since there is no real storyline I will cite a few of the ways people are tortured so this will be a warning to whether someone out there would ever want to watch this sickening piece of trash.A young girl has her mouth sawed open leaving her with a lop-sided grin that stretches ear to ear.This same young girl is cut open from the crook of her elbow to her wrist until her blood gushes out faster than an over-flowing bathtub. However the stage blood in this scene is not even convincing stage blood and looks like watered down tomato juice.She really goes to town on this same girls' boyfriend.  She uses a sharp instrument to turn his big toes to mush.  This is the nicest thing she does to him. She also punctures his cheek with a dentists' pick.  uses an electric drill to bore through his thigh and de-caps his knee with a pizza cutter. She also inserts a long sharp instrument into the young mans' penis and although it's obvious it was a prosthetic the scene is so vivid and squeamish I felt the pain in my own penis.The sadistic young woman also electrocutes, poisons and burns someone alive.This, I hesitate to call it a movie is a gorehounds delight and from the five-star ""plant"" reviewers you would think this is the best movie ever made.  It isn't. Not by a long shot. And since there is no reason for the gruesome going-ons(even Freddy Krueger had a motive in the original ""Nightmare On Elm Street), i can not recommend this sadistic piece of trash but it does deliver in the gore department and blows even ""Hostel"" in the torture genre out of the water.I happened to see the R-eated version of this picture and there is an unrated directors cut out there.

I'm not going to bother telling all about the plot, not that there's a ton to explain anyway, but I must say I was somewhat surprised by the film. Being a huge horror fan, I've sat through my fair share of terrible B-horror films. But this one was a bit different. Not to say the acting was great, but it wasn't bad. The storyline wasn't either, just for the fact that there's not a lot going on as far as plot. The characters needed more depth to them I thought, and some back story of the ""neighbor"" would have been nice. However, I find that with most good horror films, the less you know about the killer or the reason behind their methods, is better for the audience. Its left up to the imagination which I think is usually far more effective in these kinds of films. What I really appreciate about this film was its gore factor. It was on par, if not better, than effects you see in Hostel or Saw. Very effective and graphic. And anyone who appreciates good special effects, blood, and gore will see what I mean.
