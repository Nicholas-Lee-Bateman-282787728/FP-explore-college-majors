Needless to say, he was hooked shortly after watching them.The level of perversity and strange in Sunny really adds to the ambiance, which can at times feel like an acid trip.Also, anything with DeVito is bound to be good for a laugh.They should really put seasons 1-4 on Blu-ray.",5,A comedy with few rivals,1303776000,"04 26, 2011",2011,392,"['guys', 'are', 'fantastic', 'brother', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'show', 'got', 'set', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'one', 'year', 'Needless', 'say', 'was', 'hooked', 'shortly', 'watching', 'them.The', 'level', 'perversity', 'strange', 'Sunny', 'really', 'ambiance', 'can', 'times', 'feel', 'acid', 'trip.Also', 'anything', 'DeVito', 'bound', 'be', 'good', 'laugh.They', 'should', 'really', 'put', 'seasons', '1-4', 'Blu-ray']",N/A

1280951,ANBGQ9P0D93DG,B002OHDYUU,John Steele,"[0, 0]","This one of the most insanely funny tv shows of all time! It incorporates the total political incorrectness of""South Park"", the willingness to create whole new boundaries, & then trash them, of ""Chappelle's Show"" with aliberal dose of the best of ""The Three Stooges"". Many people, including myself, were & are resistant to this showat first, because there is a certain amount of stupidity that is immediately apparent. It is incorporated withvery dry humor, physical comedy that has to seen & acting that is completely convincing in an almost scary way.These characters have no redeeming human qualities at all, along with a complete lack of shame, in the very besttraditions of ""Married With Children"". There is nothing they won't try to scam, steal, lie about, ingest, pourstale beer on or try to have sex with.""Sunny"", like almost all of it's excellent fellow FX programming(Rescue Me, The Shield etc.) is for the grown-ups.It's well worth making the investment as the series is coming to Comedy Central who are almost certainly goingto censor it heavily to play in the earlier hours. Hopefully they will play some uncensored episodes in the latenight slots when they play other uncut shows. Trust me, you'll want every bit of that Philly sun shining down onyou! This is now my favorite show to turn people on to, it makes the episodes all the better when someone iswatching them for the first time.",5,Absolutely Outrageous!,1273536000,"05 11, 2010",2010,1402,"['one', 'most', 'insanely', 'funny', 'tv', 'shows', 'time', 'total', 'political', 'incorrectness', 'South', 'Park', 'willingness', 'create', 'whole', 'new', 'boundaries', 'then', 'trash', 'Chappelle', 'Show', 'aliberal', 'dose', 'best', 'Three', 'Stooges', 'Many', 'people', 'including', 'were', 'are', 'resistant', 'showat', 'first', 'certain', 'amount', 'stupidity', 'immediately', 'apparent', 'incorporated', 'withvery', 'dry', 'humor', 'physical', 'comedy', 'seen', 'acting', 'completely', 'convincing', 'almost', 'scary', 'way.These', 'characters', 'have', 'redeeming', 'human', 'qualities', 'complete', 'lack', 'shame', 'very', 'besttraditions', 'Married', 'Children', 'nothing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'try', 'scam', 'steal', 'lie', 'ingest', 'pourstale', 'beer', 'try', 'have', 'sex', 'Sunny', 'almost', 'excellent', 'fellow', 'FX', 'programming', 'Rescue', 'Me', 'Shield', 'etc', 'grown-ups.It', 'well', 'making', 'investment', 'series', 'coming', 'Comedy', 'Central', 'who', 'are', 'almost', 'certainly', 'goingto', 'censor', 'heavily', 'play', 'earlier', 'hours', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'play', 'uncensored', 'episodes', 'latenight', 'slots', 'when', 'play', 'other', 'uncut', 'shows', 'Trust', ""'ll"", 'want', 'bit', 'Philly', 'sun', 'shining', 'down', 'onyou', 'now', 'favorite', 'show', 'turn', 'people', 'episodes', 'better', 'when', 'someone', 'iswatching', 'first', 'time']",N/A
