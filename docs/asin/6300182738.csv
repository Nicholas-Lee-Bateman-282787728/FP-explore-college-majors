McQuade,"[0, 0]","One of the great films of the 1980s and one of the greatest political thrillers of all time, shot through with a palpable sense of menace and at times almost unbearable tension. Costa-Gavras takes the true story of the disappearance and murder of an American journalist, Charlie Horman, and uses it to illustrate the wider story of the United States backed overthrow of the democratically elected government of Chile in 1973, and the mass murder the coup perpetrators initiated in an effort to secure their position.At the heart of the film is one of Jack Lemmon's finest performances - which in a career that included The Apartment, The China Syndrome and Some Like it Hot, is saying something. Sissy Spacek and John Shea are dependably fine in support, underscoring the still relevant point that ideological dogmatism and mule-headed ignorance of the world invariably leads to the killing and maiming of ordinary, loving people.",5,An exemplar of cinema of conscience and courage,1324512000,"12 22, 2011",2011,930,"['One', 'great', 'films', '1980s', 'one', 'greatest', 'political', 'thrillers', 'time', 'shot', 'palpable', 'sense', 'menace', 'times', 'almost', 'unbearable', 'tension', 'Costa-Gavras', 'true', 'story', 'disappearance', 'murder', 'American', 'journalist', 'Charlie', 'Horman', 'illustrate', 'wider', 'story', 'United', 'States', 'backed', 'overthrow', 'democratically', 'elected', 'government', 'Chile', '1973', 'mass', 'murder', 'coup', 'perpetrators', 'initiated', 'effort', 'secure', 'position.At', 'heart', 'film', 'one', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'finest', 'performances', 'career', 'included', 'Apartment', 'China', 'Syndrome', 'Hot', 'saying', 'something', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'John', 'Shea', 'are', 'dependably', 'fine', 'support', 'underscoring', 'still', 'relevant', 'point', 'ideological', 'dogmatism', 'mule-headed', 'ignorance', 'world', 'invariably', 'killing', 'maiming', 'ordinary', 'loving', 'people']",Missing VHS

202150,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6300182738,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 9]","I know that my opinion is in the minority here, but `Missing' was not the film I was hoping to see.  It draws similarities to last years `A Mighty Heart' but it has almost the complete opposite set of detractions.  I was really put off by `A Mighty Hearts' chaotic pacing (which I tend to believe was a result of trying to convey the chaos of the situation) and found that I couldn't really invest myself in the film as deeply as I wanted to.  With `Missing' I felt the opposite was happening.  The film suffers from almost no chaos.  It just kind of remains stagnant and causes my interest to wane considerably.The story behind `Missing' is one of intrigue.  It follows Beth and Ed Horman as they pressure the government to find their missing husband/son.  Charlie Horman, a journalist, was in South America (where he lived with this wife) when he went missing, and the local authorities do not seem to want to lend a helping hand as Beth and Ed struggle to find him.What I will say about the film is that script was constructed very well.  The political corruption that stilted the discovery of Charles whereabouts is brilliantly handled and given ample attention.  The relationship between Beth and Ed is also given just treatment, for they are seen as real people and not characters on a screen.  This being a true story, it is important that there be an honesty to the situations and activities, and you can feel that in `Missing'.  I won't say that the pacing hinders the film entirely, for there are moments within the film where the pulled back delivery works well, but the entire film should not feel that way.  A little more attention to that detail could have lifted this film from a merely passable drama to a tightly woven drama.Another quarrel that I have is with Jack Lemmon.  I personally adore this actor and feel that almost everything he has touched has been fantastic.  This was not one of those moments for me.  I didn't feel as though his confliction was believable.  He felt almost uncomfortable, and that discomfort didn't read well on the screen.  When I first saw this film I thought that maybe I just didn't like Lemmon as a dramatic actor, but that's not the case, for his performances in films like `The China Syndrome' and `Short Cuts' were impeccable to say the least.  Here though I just saw him acting as apposed to living.Like `A Mighty Heart' though, `Missing' rises on the wings if it's female lead.  Sissy Spacek is effortlessly captivating as Beth.  Her performance captures everything that Lemmon could not, delivering a real living breathing wife trying desperately to find answers.  Spacek is a phenomenal actress, and this is one of her finest performances.In the end I have to say that `Missing' did not deliver all that it should have.  I know that I am not in the majority when I say that, for most of the reviews for this film are on the four and five star range.  Maybe they are seeing something that I am not; well, obviously they are.  To say that I just don't appreciate a slow moving drama would be missing the point (some of my favorite films are slower paced and brooding like `In the Bedroom' or the recently reviewed `The Door in the Floor') because to slow a film down to create a mood is one thing, but there comes a point where your pace can effect your audiences interest, and if that is not taken into account then one can become bored and eventually sever all emotional connection to a film.  You have to learn when to speed things up and when to pull things back.  There's compromise and give and take in everything; especially filmmaking.",3,This film is truly missing something...,1218585600,"08 13, 2008",2008,3601,"['know', 'opinion', 'minority', 'here', 'Missing', 'was', 'not', 'film', 'was', 'hoping', 'see', 'similarities', 'last', 'years', 'Mighty', 'Heart', 'almost', 'complete', 'opposite', 'set', 'detractions', 'was', 'really', 'put', 'off', 'Mighty', 'Hearts', 'chaotic', 'pacing', 'tend', 'believe', 'was', 'result', 'trying', 'convey', 'chaos', 'situation', 'found', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'invest', 'film', 'as', 'deeply', 'wanted', 'Missing', 'felt', 'opposite', 'was', 'happening', 'film', 'suffers', 'almost', 'chaos', 'just', 'kind', 'remains', 'stagnant', 'interest', 'wane', 'considerably.The', 'story', 'Missing', 'one', 'intrigue', 'Beth', 'Ed', 'Horman', 'pressure', 'government', 'find', 'missing', 'husband/son', 'Charlie', 'Horman', 'journalist', 'was', 'South', 'America', 'where', 'lived', 'wife', 'when', 'went', 'missing', 'local', 'authorities', 'do', 'not', 'seem', 'want', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'Beth', 'Ed', 'struggle', 'find', 'him.What', 'will', 'say', 'film', 'script', 'was', 'constructed', 'very', 'well', 'political', 'corruption', 'stilted', 'discovery', 'Charles', 'whereabouts', 'brilliantly', 'handled', 'given', 'ample', 'attention', 'relationship', 'Beth', 'Ed', 'also', 'given', 'just', 'treatment', 'are', 'seen', 'real', 'people', 'not', 'characters', 'screen', 'being', 'true', 'story', 'important', 'be', 'honesty', 'situations', 'activities', 'can', 'feel', 'Missing', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'pacing', 'film', 'entirely', 'are', 'moments', 'film', 'where', 'pulled', 'back', 'delivery', 'works', 'well', 'entire', 'film', 'should', 'not', 'feel', 'way', 'little', 'more', 'attention', 'detail', 'could', 'have', 'lifted', 'film', 'merely', 'passable', 'drama', 'tightly', 'woven', 'drama.Another', 'quarrel', 'have', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'personally', 'adore', 'actor', 'feel', 'almost', 'everything', 'touched', 'been', 'fantastic', 'was', 'not', 'one', 'moments', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'confliction', 'was', 'believable', 'felt', 'almost', 'uncomfortable', 'discomfort', 'did', ""n't"", 'read', 'well', 'screen', 'When', 'first', 'saw', 'film', 'thought', 'maybe', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'like', 'Lemmon', 'dramatic', 'actor', 'not', 'case', 'performances', 'films', 'China', 'Syndrome', 'Short', 'Cuts', 'were', 'impeccable', 'say', 'least', 'Here', 'just', 'saw', 'acting', 'apposed', 'living.Like', 'Mighty', 'Heart', 'though', 'Missing', 'rises', 'wings', 'female', 'lead', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'effortlessly', 'captivating', 'Beth', 'performance', 'captures', 'everything', 'Lemmon', 'could', 'not', 'delivering', 'real', 'living', 'breathing', 'wife', 'trying', 'desperately', 'find', 'answers', 'Spacek', 'phenomenal', 'actress', 'one', 'finest', 'performances.In', 'end', 'have', 'say', 'Missing', 'did', 'not', 'deliver', 'should', 'have', 'know', 'am', 'not', 'majority', 'when', 'say', 'most', 'reviews', 'film', 'are', 'four', 'five', 'star', 'range', 'Maybe', 'are', 'seeing', 'something', 'am', 'not', 'well', 'obviously', 'are', 'say', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'slow', 'moving', 'drama', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'point', 'favorite', 'films', 'are', 'slower', 'paced', 'brooding', 'Bedroom', 'recently', 'reviewed', 'Door', 'Floor', 'slow', 'film', 'down', 'create', 'mood', 'one', 'thing', 'there', 'point', 'where', 'pace', 'can', 'effect', 'audiences', 'interest', 'not', 'taken', 'account', 'then', 'one', 'can', 'become', 'bored', 'eventually', 'sever', 'emotional', 'connection', 'film', 'have', 'learn', 'when', 'speed', 'things', 'up', 'when', 'pull', 'things', 'back', 'compromise', 'give', 'take', 'everything', 'especially', 'filmmaking']",Missing VHS

This is mostly because it lacks any real poetry, the way Ingmar Bergman's anti-war film, Shame, has.Nonetheless, Missing is a very good film (it won the 1982 Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival)- a prose work, if not poetic; and the screenplay by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart (which won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay) wears its prosaicness in almost every scene that shows its protagonists relentlessly pushing for the truth. It also showcases probably the best acting performance of the late Jack Lemmon's long career, and it makes one wish he had done more dramatic roles, for as great a comedic actor as he was (The Odd Couple, The Fortune Cookie, etc.), Woody Allen was correct when he claimed that drama was 'sitting at the grownups' table.' It also features some good, if not daring, cinematography by Ricardo Aronovich (the shot of a government helicopter outside of the Horman's hotel room is the best in the film), and a surprisingly understated musical score by Vangelis.The film is about the 1973 kidnap, torture, and execution of Harvard graduate Charles Horman (John Shea), a nave political dreamer from Middle America, who, with wife and friends, thought he could make a difference by publishing a Left Wing newspaper in Chile, during the Marxist regime of the newly elected Salvador Allende. Then, when the CIA-backed coup of Augusto Pinochet occurred, he and his cronies were personae non grata. The film shows a bit of Horman's life with his wife, Beth (Sissy Spacek), and friends, before he goes missing. After that, we get the appearance of Charles' father, a conservative Christian Scientist businessman named Ed (Lemmon). Very much then happens in the film, save that Ed and Beth both get the runaround from scummy American political waterboys, and Ed grows more and more cynical, after, early on, believing that the American government could do no wrong and that neither Charles nor Beth could do no right.Perhaps the best aspect of the film is that it does not dwell on gore and violence, instead letting the aftermath paint pictures of what occurred within the viewer's mind, for the imagination is almost always more powerful, disturbing, and graphic than special effects, something this modestly budgeted film conspicuously lacks. The worst moment is likely when a couple of the American flacks at the U.S. Consulate are caught in a lie by Ed, who knows his son has been killed, and they tell him his son is likely still 'in hiding.' The duo so brazenly mock Ed, by telling him that his son should have expected to get burned, just as if he had gone snooping around into the New York Mafia's business. Now, no doubt this claim is a true one, and Charles' nave-te certainly aided his demise, but no government officials would be that brazen and stupid to taunt an American citizen grieving his child's death, much less one like Horman, who obviously had some connections in the government. While this is in keeping with the film's whole portrayal of arrogant Yankee cowboys, it does not square with the obsessive nature of the CIA in covering up their crimes around the world. Yes, it manifests the arc and direction of the film, but it does so at the cost of any realism.Still, Missing is a film worth seeing, both for its technical quality and its historical mise-en-scene. Just don't expect a film that will last for years in your memory; but do expect to not have that sinking feeling of another unrecoverable two hours of your life. And, given all the crap that Hollywood produces for the Lowest Common Denominator masses today, that's more than just faint praise.",4,Excellent,1248825600,"07 29, 2009",2009,3736,"['1982', 'political', 'film', 'Missing', 'Costa-Gavras', 'first', 'American', 'production', 'good', 'film', 'not', 'great', 'one', 'mostly', 'real', 'poetry', 'way', 'Ingmar', 'Bergman', 'anti-war', 'film', 'Shame', 'has.Nonetheless', 'Missing', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'won', '1982', 'Palme', ""d'Or"", 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'prose', 'work', 'not', 'poetic', 'screenplay', 'Costa-Gavras', 'Donald', 'Stewart', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay', 'prosaicness', 'almost', 'scene', 'protagonists', 'relentlessly', 'pushing', 'truth', 'also', 'probably', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'late', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'long', 'career', 'one', 'wish', 'had', 'done', 'more', 'dramatic', 'roles', 'as', 'great', 'comedic', 'actor', 'was', 'Odd', 'Couple', 'Fortune', 'Cookie', 'etc', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'was', 'correct', 'when', 'claimed', 'drama', 'was', ""'sitting"", 'grownups', 'table', 'also', 'good', 'not', 'daring', 'cinematography', 'Ricardo', 'Aronovich', 'shot', 'government', 'helicopter', 'Horman', 'hotel', 'room', 'best', 'film', 'surprisingly', 'understated', 'musical', 'score', 'Vangelis.The', 'film', '1973', 'kidnap', 'torture', 'execution', 'Harvard', 'graduate', 'Charles', 'Horman', 'John', 'Shea', 'nave', 'political', 'dreamer', 'Middle', 'America', 'who', 'wife', 'friends', 'thought', 'could', 'make', 'difference', 'publishing', 'Left', 'Wing', 'newspaper', 'Chile', 'Marxist', 'regime', 'newly', 'elected', 'Salvador', 'Allende', 'Then', 'when', 'CIA-backed', 'coup', 'Augusto', 'Pinochet', 'occurred', 'cronies', 'were', 'personae', 'non', 'grata', 'film', 'bit', 'Horman', 'life', 'wife', 'Beth', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'friends', 'missing', 'get', 'appearance', 'Charles', 'father', 'conservative', 'Christian', 'Scientist', 'businessman', 'named', 'Ed', 'Lemmon', 'Very', 'much', 'then', 'film', 'save', 'Ed', 'Beth', 'get', 'runaround', 'scummy', 'American', 'political', 'waterboys', 'Ed', 'more', 'more', 'cynical', 'early', 'believing', 'American', 'government', 'could', 'do', 'wrong', 'Charles', 'Beth', 'could', 'do', 'right.Perhaps', 'best', 'aspect', 'film', 'not', 'dwell', 'gore', 'violence', 'instead', 'letting', 'aftermath', 'paint', 'pictures', 'what', 'occurred', 'viewer', 'mind', 'imagination', 'almost', 'always', 'more', 'powerful', 'disturbing', 'graphic', 'special', 'effects', 'something', 'modestly', 'budgeted', 'film', 'conspicuously', 'worst', 'moment', 'likely', 'when', 'couple', 'American', 'flacks', 'U.S.', 'Consulate', 'are', 'caught', 'lie', 'Ed', 'who', 'son', 'been', 'killed', 'tell', 'son', 'likely', 'still', 'hiding', 'duo', 'so', 'brazenly', 'mock', 'Ed', 'telling', 'son', 'should', 'have', 'expected', 'get', 'burned', 'just', 'had', 'gone', 'snooping', 'around', 'New', 'York', 'Mafia', 'business', 'Now', 'doubt', 'claim', 'true', 'one', 'Charles', 'nave-te', 'certainly', 'aided', 'demise', 'government', 'officials', 'would', 'be', 'brazen', 'stupid', 'taunt', 'American', 'citizen', 'grieving', 'child', 'death', 'much', 'less', 'one', 'Horman', 'who', 'obviously', 'had', 'connections', 'government', 'keeping', 'film', 'whole', 'portrayal', 'arrogant', 'Yankee', 'cowboys', 'not', 'square', 'obsessive', 'nature', 'CIA', 'covering', 'up', 'crimes', 'world', 'Yes', 'arc', 'direction', 'film', 'so', 'cost', 'realism.Still', 'Missing', 'film', 'seeing', 'technical', 'quality', 'historical', 'mise-en-scene', 'Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'film', 'will', 'last', 'years', 'memory', 'do', 'expect', 'not', 'have', 'sinking', 'feeling', 'unrecoverable', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'given', 'crap', 'Hollywood', 'Lowest', 'Common', 'Denominator', 'masses', 'today', 'more', 'just', 'faint', 'praise']",Missing VHS

In the first interview, he addresses the controversy surrounding the film - the U.S. administration did not like the parallels to the situation in El Salvador at the time. The second interview features the director talking about the origins of the project.Charles' wife, Joyce Horman (played by Sissy Spacek in the film) is interviewed and talks about the accuracy of Missing. She feels that it was lenient on the portrayal of the U.S. government. Joyce talks about how and why she and Charles were in Chile. She also offers her impressions of what it was like there at the time.""Producing Missing"" features producers Edward and Mildred Lewis and Sean Daniel, and writer Thomas Hauser, author of the film's source book, discussing the making of the film. The Lewis' talk about how Hauser's book motivated them to get the film made. Hauser talks about what drew him to the Charles' story. This is an excellent look at how the film came together by the people who worked on it.""1982 Cannes Film Festival"" features Costa-Gavras, Jack Lemmon, Ed and Joyce Horman with family friend Terry Simon are interviewed at the festival. Lemmon talks about what drew him to the film while the Hormans talk about their experiences and what they think of the film.""Pursuing the Truth"" is an interview with Peter Kornbluh, director of the National Security Archive's Chile Documentation Project. He talks about declassified documents pertaining to the U.S.' involvement in the execution of Charles. Kornbluh provides fascinating background to the political background of the film. He also examines how the film is very critical of U.S. involvement in Chile and they helped bring about a coup d'etat.Finally, there is ""In Honor of Missing,"" an excerpt from a 2002 event by the Charles Horman Truth Project to support efforts to bring General Augusto Pinochet and others to justice for human rights violations.

So I thought I'd take a different approach. With regards to the performances in this film, they are simply stunning - this made for a powerful piece of cinema...In this day of CGI-made films, focus groups choosing endings, studios picking people for roles based on revenue, movies with parts II, III, IV, etc, this is a throwback to real cinema. Similarly, No Country for Old Men qualifies as a modern day masterpiece - when the acting is brilliant, and there's a good story we have a recipe for a fantastic film.Sadly this film is not just fiction: it is about a topic which is all too real. A sad comment on repressive regimes and the complexities and dangers of supporting regimes for political reasons. More than that, the personal story illustrates it more powerfully perhaps that a documentary ever could. And I am a huge fan of documentaries.This review is not a detailed one, it is mostly my personal experience and thoughts on how this film affected me - it has no info with respect to the Criterion release - it is an appeal in support of one of my favorite films of all time.My only quibble would be that Criterion has already announced pre-releases for their first Bluray discs in November - my impatient nature wants a Bluray release (especially because I like this film so much) but then again a fine piece of cinema like this would not NEED the added visual appeal to enhance the power of the film.

202165,A11PTCZ2FM2547,6300182738,"D. Mikels ""It's always Happy Hour here""","[13, 37]","Following my first viewing of this movie, I was angry.  At the filmmaker.  There are two sides to every story, but obviously such common sense is lost on director Costa-Gavras, whose radical and anti-American agenda is the motor that drives the story for MISSING--a film that remains as controversial as its award-winning release more than two decades ago.Don't get me wrong.  Was there despicable behavior on the part of the U.S. government during the CIA-backed coup in Chile back in 1973?  You bet.  Was American involvement in the overthrow of a democratically elected government a serious mistake?  In hindsight, yes.  Yet Costa-Gravas' portrayal of bloodthirsty soldiers gunning people down in the streets--with the duplicitous approval of evil American officials--creates more questions than answers.  And the film suggests the Americans gave tacit approval for the execution of fellow citizens by the new regime, an outstanding assertion that was implied, but never proven--particularly by Costa-Gravas.  Further eroding the credibility of the film was the alleged ""idealistic"" presence of Americans living in Chile prior to Allende's ouster.  So these people were there to bask in and appreciate and study a South American socialist paradise?  Nothing more?  Hmmm?But enough whining.  Once I got over the political agenda of this film I concentrated on the story--of a man and his daughter-in-law going on an agonizing journey to find both a son and a husband.  When young Charlie Horman (John Shea) suddenly disappears shortly following the military coup, his father, Ed (Jack Lemmon), travels to Chile to personally look for his son.  Ed is a consummate American patriot; he believes in the inherent goodness of his government, and he also disapproves of the lifestyle and politics of his son and daughter-in-law, Beth (Sissy Spacek).  It becomes apparent that Ed and Charlie were fairly estranged, yet the father learns more and more about his son--and his daughter-in-law--in his hopeless quest.  I despise government bureaucracy, and Ed has to confront it in spades:  never-ending red tape, misinformation, lack of cooperation, even callousness, from his own embassy and consulates.  On top of what appears to be a cover-up, Ed and Beth must deal with the constant stress of uniformed thugs in the streets, of going through hospitals, and then morgues, as the somber realization slowly comes to clarity:  that Charlie will not be found.Jack Lemmon is brilliant in this film.  He vividly creates the anguish of a father looking for his son; several of his scenes, particularly in the latter stages of the movie, are heartbreaking.  Spacek is equally good as a loving wife--as a daughter-in-law who gains more and more respect from Ed.  MISSING is compelling and spellbinding drama, and despite my discomfort with its politics I recommend it.--D.

202167,A2UUWETDYA2EKV,6300182738,Douglas Doepke,"[4, 4]","There's a particularly chilling scene in this movie. It comes near the end in a confrontation between Charles Horman (Jack Lemmon) and staff members of the American ambassador in post-coup Chile, 1973. To this point the staff has sounded polished and professional in their concern for Horman's missing son, an apparent casualty of the coup. But in this scene the devious reality of American policy begins to emerge from behind the velvet glove, and Horman's passage from credulous liberal to disillusioned skeptic is complete. In a nutshell, the scene symbolizes one of the great divides in American political life, between the polished propaganda face our government presents to the people and the grim realities that face covers over, especially in dealing with Third World countries like Chile. Horman represents the frustration many feel in trying to deal with a cosmetic facade supported by both major political parties, when beneath it crouches the murderous policies of imperial rule.The real question the film poses is what Horman will do upon returning home.The film itself remains a gripping eyeopener from first to last. Costa-Gravas is especially good at recreating the abject terror of fascist rule: where long hair is forbidden and women are forced back into skirts, where people are present one minute and gone the next, where a democratically elected government is present one minute and gone the next, and where a Henry Kissinger can do the behind-the-scenes dirty work and be honored for it (not in the movie, but true nevertheless). The acting is first-rate, and a tour-de-force for Lemmon in particular. Ditto, the often overlooked Charles Cioffi who puts the real chill in the confrontation scene.

202168,ADS5APY1NKTL4,6300182738,"D. Pawl ""Dani""","[2, 2]","MISSING, based on the book by Thomas Hauser, examined the fated journey that Ed Horman and his daughter took, as well as the strides they made in attempting to locate his son, Charles, a missing journalist who disappeared in Chile, during the height of Allende's dictatorship in the early 1970s.  Though, this film adaptation does not mention Chile directly, you don't have to read between the lines too closely to know what country it is alluding to.  Director Costa-Gavras powerfully directed this piece, and his cast works brilliantly together.  Jack Lemmon is stoic and very believable as Ed, Sissy Spacek is chilling as Charles Horman's wife, and John Shea does a great job in portraying the missing journalist.I couldn't help feeling a sense of profound rage as I watched the horrible political corruption that existed in 1970s Chile, and how seemingly apathetic the United States government appeared, especially when they were called upon to search for and follow up on the case of Charles Horman.  It was almost as though one human life was of little or no interest to those in political office, perhaps due to the fact that it wasn't significant or ""high profile"" enough to earn their compassion.

202169,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,6300182738,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 3]","Accomplished Greek-French filmmaker Costa-Gavras has a compelling way of bringing the emotional resonance out of stories with overtly political themes. He hits the nail on the head with this searing indictment of American involvement in the 1973 military coup that ejected Allende from power in Chile. Facts are not discretely presented, even the country in which the story takes place is not disclosed (except for specific references to the cities of Santiago and Vina Del Mar). Yet, Costa-Gavras creates an atmosphere of palpable tension that doesn't let up in this 1982 film, and the unraveling mystery at the heart of the movie echoes the unsettling political situation surrounding the characters.Adapted by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart from Thomas Hauser's non-fiction book documenting the true case, the plot focuses on American expatriate Charles Horman whose sudden disappearance in the days after the Pinochet coup brings together two familial adversaries, his wife Beth and his father Ed, who has flown in from New York. Charles and Beth had been leading a vagabond existence with his work in children's animation and their relatively passive support of Allende's reform measures. Charles' back story is revealed in carefully constructed flashback episodes that show him to be curious about the presence of U.S. military personnel in the area. Once he disappears, Ed and Beth seek help from the U.S. Consulate but face a seemingly insurmountable wall of bureaucracy. Frustrated, Ed, a highly conservative Christian Scientist, lashes out at Beth for what he considers her undesirable influence over his son. However, as they absorb the scope of the violence and the culpability of the U.S. government, they bond intractably toward their objective of finding Charles.For once, Jack Lemmon, unafraid to convey his character's prejudices, is able to use his neurotically coiled energy in a suitable dramatic role as Ed. The result is a startlingly raw performance that ranks among his best. Sissy Spacek is terrific as Beth, though her character does not experience as big an arc of self-revelation. In the elliptical flashback role of Charles, John Shea provides solid support, as do Janice Rule as a political activist and a number of familiar TV faces - Melanie Mayron as friend Terry and David Clennon as U.S. consul Phil Putnam, both from ""thirtysomething"", and Joe Regalbuto, Frank from ""Murphy Brown"", playing another Frank, a possible victim of the coup.

Lemmon openly disapproves of Shea's and Spacek's political views and staunchly supports the preservation of the American way of life.  Unfortunately, his rose-colored view of his country slowly but surely come apart as he and Spacek, who are initially at considerable odds, unravel bit by bit important details.  As one Chilean informant tells them, Shea disappeared because &quot;he knew too much.&quot;  He knew that thousands of innocent people were being murdered by the new Chilean government, a staunch right-wing one that ousted a far more Marxist regime led by Salvador Allende.Eventually, MISSING comes to a point of increased sadness and anger, as Lemmon comes to realize that not only was Shea killed (in the national soccer stadium), but that his own government probably had a hand in doing it.  The unfolding tragedy brings Lemmon and Spacek together in the end.A very poignant and highly dramatic story, with a fine score by Vangelis, MISSING also boasts typically top-of-the-line performances by Lemmon and Spacek, who have never been anything less than watchable.  The script by Costa-Gavras and Donald Stewart (the latter of whom would do the adaptations of three Tom Clancy novels in the 1990s), won a richly-deserved Oscar for adapted screenplay (from Thomas Hauser's similarly-titled novel).As to the previous reviewer's attack on the film as left-wing propaganda, I honorably but strongly disagree with that notion.The facts have shown that the U.S. government supported the coup against Allende only because he believed in communism, but the regime that came to power then systematically trampled over the basic human rights of its people.  And here, it very well may have contributed to the death of a young American--and the U.S. government turned its back on that man!  No government anywhere in the world, anti-communist or otherwise, is worth American support if it ignores human rights.  THAT is the political arguement clearly at the heart of this excellent 1982 drama.",5,MISSING is left-wing propaganda?

After graduation, I didn't keep in touch with Charlie. In fact, the first I heard of his fate at the hands of the butcher Pinochet was when this movie was released. Needless to say, it was the most traumatic experience I've ever had at the cinema.Ironically, one of the other young men at Harvard in the early 1960s was the son of Milton Friedman, the University of Chicago economist whose economic dogma of absolutist capitalist had almost as much to do with the death of Charles Horman and of the thousands of others who ""disappeared"" into CIA files and unmarked mass graves in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. I can't remember for sure whether Charlie, David Friedman, and I ever argued about politics/economics as a threesome, but if we did, it would have cast Charlie as the moderate. Moderation and human decency were the qualities most remembered about Charles Horman among his friends and acquaintances at Harvard. Rather few of us foresaw that Friedman's 'neo-liberal' economics, now known as neo-conservatism, would become the intellectual justification of decades of terror-based tyranny in Latin America just as much as for the rise of Reaganomics and the attempt by GW Bush to build a new global free-market Iraq not wanted by Iraqis.

202173,A1X28NWPDMTDG7,6300182738,Gregg Hillier,"[0, 1]","""Missing"" is the first American film by esteemed Director Costa Gavras, who makes the most of his talented Cast and an excellent screenplay. It seems that Charles Horman (John Shea), a Liberal Journalist covering a Coup de Etat in an unnamed South American country, has been kidnapped and his naive wife Beth (Sissy Spacek) is getting nowhere with the American Embassy. She enlists the help of her Father-In-Law Ed (Jack Lemmon), a Bible-thumping East Coast Conservative, who seems to think that his son's political views are to blame for his disappearance. As Ed and Beth make their way around the war-torn City, Ed becomes increasingly aware that the Americans are lying and that his Son was a good guy after all. As the film unfolds, we also meet some of the Horman's friends, notably Melanie Mayron as a photographer and Joe Regelbutto as a fellow Writer, who meets a similar fate as Charles Horman. Both Lemmon and Spacek have great parts, but it's Lemmon who is the most affecting. As he evolves from a tough, proud Patriot into a broken man mourning the Son he never knew, Lemmon's seamless performance is one of the best of his career. Spacek underacts beatifully - her muted expressions convey more emotion than if she went over the top with screaming hysterics. Logistically, however, there are some issues. The film opens with a title card stating that this is a true story, but ends with a US State Department message denying all the events in the film. The story is supposed to take place in Chile, but it was filmed rather obviously in Mexico City. The Airport scenes take place openly in the Mexico City Airport, there are several ""plugs"" for Braniff Airlines, and the Cast of extras are clearly Mexican and not Chilean - even a casual observer can tell the difference.

202174,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,6300182738,Gregor von Kallahann,"[1, 2]","I have not read the source book for this 1982 Costa-Gavras political film, but it would appear that not too many liberties were taken with the actual events on which MISSING is based.  At least, one can guess as much since the film is as full of random twists and turns as real life is.  A more calculated filmmaker would probably have ""distilled"" the facts of the story down more, you know, to get the ""essential truth of the events,"" or, more honestly, to make for a more steamlined, evenly paced (and hence, more marketable) movie.  That is, of course, not the way Costa-Gavras works, and his adherence to the facts (at least as he understands them) is an admirable trait.  For once, you are not tempted to snicker when you learn that a film was ""inspired by actual events.""It's probably not too surprising, then, that the narrative was not altered to make for a ""bigger"" ending.  A father's search for his missing son in bloody, post-Allende Chile, does not end with the discovery of a corpse, or with a dramatic confession on the part of the wrongdoers or their allies.  Word is gradually leaked to the grieving all-American dad, joined in the search by his courageous, vaguely countercultural daughter-in-law, that his son was killed only a few days after the junta came to power.  And when that truth comes out, it is not denied by the American authorities who had ostensibly been assisting the duo in their search.Somehow the body is located and, months later, returned to the family in the US.  By that time, the body is too decomposed for an autopsy to yield any authoritative results and the newly ""politicized"" dad is thwarted in his attempts to sue US authorities for the wrongful death of his son.  (It would appear that the vengeance that remained to him is the publication and eventual filmization of his book--which, one hopes, may have provided him some way of honoring his son in death and some satisfaction that guilty parties had been, at least, publicly named).So MISSING would appear to be an honest and heartfelt movie.  It is not, however, without its flaws.  The film makes much of the inherent conflict between the button-downed, Christian Scientist dad and his irreverent, hippie-ish daughter-in-law.  Whatever the real-life relationship may have been, the film parlays it into a more traditional ""teaming of opposites"" cinematic trope.  Troupers Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek give the script their all, and oft times the honesty is there.  Other times, their steady bickering comes across as the standard screenwriters take on ""intergenerational warfare.""A few other crucial moments ring false too.  An exchange between Lemmon and US officials wherein the latter virtually admit their involvement, seem to justify their support of the coup as a means of preserving the US's ""damn fine way of life"" is both cliched and dramatically off beat.  I'm not sure if any such passage appeared in the book, but whatever the case, the movie version of that encounter needed a much lighter hand.One opportunity that seems to have been wasted in the film is the significance of Jack Lemmon's character's devout faith in Christian Science.  When asked by one of the American officials about his beliefs, Lemmon replies that it's about ""faith...in the truth.""  That may not be such a horrible summation of one of Christian Science's basic tenets, but here it is used, for dramatic effect, as a signal that the protagonist will prove to be relentless in his search for the truth about his son's disappearance.His devotion to the faith also provides the filmmaker with a shorthand explanation for the father's seemingly entrenched conservatism.  I would not dispute that many Christian Scientists lean a bit right of center, politically.  Even when that's the case, however, CS is fundmentally different from the hardline social conservatism found in Christian fundamentalism, say.  According to the Church's teaching, political conflict--like all human discord and disease--is essentially a misperception of humankind's true nature as a spiritual, non-material being.  War, strife, and bloody revolution ultimately have no spiritual reality: they are, essentially, all part of the ""Adam dream,"" and ultimately illusory.Had the father's inner spiritual conflict been played out more in this movie, it could have made for some riveting moments, I'm sure.  In order for him to become ""radicalized"" or ""politicized"" at all, he would have to come to question basic tenets of his deeply held faith.  It is almost certainly something of an oversimplification to suggest that a devout ""Scientist"" would have to deny the truth his ""mortal senses"" are screaming at him, but he would certainly have to see his son's disappearance, ultimately, as one more apparent human evil in need of spiritual healing.That he cannot, that he must engage in earthly conflict with malevolent political forces suggests a profound spiritual crisis that could have been fascinating to see at least suggested...if not fully played out.  Lemmon's character seems, of necessity perhaps, to be abandoning his church's fundamental teaching that ""divine love has always met and will always meet every human need"" to draw the conclusion sometimes a man has to take a stand and fight a very real--very earthbound--battle against human evil.Not easy to portray on screen, but even hinted at, that spiritual crisis would have added yet another dimension to an already worthy film.",4,Crises--Both Political And Spiritual,1169251200,"01 20, 2007",2007,5452,"['have', 'not', 'read', 'source', 'book', '1982', 'Costa-Gavras', 'political',

In 1982 he crossed into the main stream with the Hollywood backed ""Missing."" This is a film about the military coup, led by General Agusto Pinochet, and the violent overthrow of Chile's democratically elected President Salvador Allende's Popular Unity Government in 1973. The U.S. government, and the CIA, assisted the Chilean military in the coup. This is a terrible tale of the torture and murder of innocents, and the personal, true story of one of them, U.S. citizen Charles Horman. Horman was a gentle, kind young man with a love of writing and the arts.Charles and his wife Beth, movingly portrayed by Sissy Spacek, were living in Chile, as were many foreigners at that time, to learn about the new socialist coalition government that had come together under Allende. There was much excitement and idealism in the air. Horman, after witnessing US government military and CIA officials in Valparaiso, Chile, was driven back to Santiago by an American stranger, during the first hours of the coup. He disappeared shortly after his return home. Not one member of his family, or his friends saw him alive again.Charles Horman's father, brilliantly played by Jack Lemmon, traveled to Santiago immediately, and he and Beth began a long, terrifying and unrewarding search for the disappeared young man. Mr. Horman was very conservative politically, and disapproved of Charles' and Beth's move to Chile. He was a patriotic American who believed that the US government would certainly help him find his son. He slowly began to acknowledge the truth, with Beth leading the way, about the US Embassy's cover-ups and lies. The American foreign service personnel, and US Ambassador, obviously knew the whereabouts and fate of his son, and her husband, and that of many of their disappeared friends.This is a political drama of the first order. The poignancy and sadness of the lives lost, and the terrible military dictatorship that replaced a democracy, in a country known for its stable, democratic government, is portrayed realistically, in a docu-drama style. The acting is superb. The screen play certainly deserved the Oscar it received.Whatever your politics, the events portrayed in this film did occur. There is much food for thought in this powerful film.JANA",5,A Mighty Film!

202181,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6300182738,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[12, 13]","Missing is more timely than ever.  As of this writing (December 2004) the notorious Chilean dictator Pinochet is now on trial for crimes against humanity in his native country where, if justice prevails, he will be dealt with harshly.  In this film, set in an unnamed country but obviously Chile (the cities of Vina del Mar and Santiago are referred to explicitly), Charlie Horman and his wife Beth have come to live, circa the mid to late 70s, and it is there that Charlie goes missing.The extreme violence of the regime is depicted well here--people are executed both on- and off-screen--but even more piercing is the intentional, cold callousness of the obviously complicitous Americans with titles--either military or political--who think nothing of mentioning a freight charge to an American who has just recently found out about the death of his son and wants the body sent back to the US.In probably his best dramatic performance on film, Jack Lemmon portrays Ed Horman, Charlie's father, who, with Beth, initiates a search for his missing son.  At first dismissive of Beth's clearly liberal politics, he quickly comes to understand the reason for her cynicism.  In the face of harsh indifference, brutal lies, and extreme violence, his humanity emerges and we see a man at the end of his tether expressing what is deepest and truest in his heart.Sissy Spacek as Beth is also very fine, as is the supporting cast--John Shea as Charlie, Charles Cioffi as the snide Major Towers, Joe Regalbuto as a friend of Charlie's who refuses to accept just how bad things are, and David Clennon as a particularly obnoxious American diplomat.  But this is a tour-de-force for Jack Lemmon and he is absolutely riveting.In this film, Costa-Gavras has gravitated from the somewhat one-dimensional--though groundbreaking--focus in Z on political corruption to political violence that directly impacts the lives of two individuals who respond humanly to it.  This gives the film a profound emotional depth that we did not see in Z, and makes it supremely compelling.  Though Z is a great film, this, I feel, is far superior; I count it as Costa-Gavras' best, in fact.Based on true events, Missing is a powerful film that will stand the test of time for decades to come.

202182,AZ4Q3VAK6CIJS,6300182738,Mary Esterhammer-Fic,"[8, 37]","This film may have been originally intended as ""left-wing propaganda,"" as some reviewers contend...or not. It may just be Costa-Gavras's simplistic worldview that is not necessarilly left or right wing but definitely victim-centric.It's essentially another example of being dumb enough to get into something WAY over your head and not surviving to tell about it.Charles/Charlie Hormann (Charles to his dad, Charlie to his wife) lives, writes and snoops around in a South American country (Chile, maybe! wink wink) that is imploding with civil war--a military regime has just overthrown the kind, compassionate Marxists who were most recently in power. Charlie, when not working on his illustrated fable starring a duck (yes, he's sensitive and artistic), takes a little road trip and runs into a guy who may as well be wearing a t-shirt that says, I AM A CIA ASSASSIN. (""Here's my card, in case you want someone whacked."") Charlie pesters this person with questions of a political nature, clumsily trying to get information about the coup but instead marking himself as a troublemaker.Because the CIA usually knows what it's doing, Charlie then disappears. COULD IT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH HIS STUPIDITY? As it happens, yes.His dad flies down, and this is really the best aspect of the film: Jack Lemmon is great. Mr. Hormann at first gives the American government--represented by embassy personnel--the benefit of the doubt when they, Sergeant Schulz-like, claim to know NOTHING. But it eventually becomes obvious that they're just trying to be nice and cooperative until Mr. Hormann goes back home--which only makes Hormann more determined. (His daughter-in-law/Charlie's wife, Sissy Spacek, treats the authorities with cynicism and hostility,and Hormann eventually begins to see that she has her reasons.) Eventually Mr. Hormann has to admit to himself that his country's representatives may be up to no good, and that Charlie was indeed the victim of foul play.Your heart really goes out to Lemmon when he tells the ambassador, ""I just want my boy back.""But sympathy for Charlie? I didn't have much. This is the equivalent of a person who wants to go swimming in shark-infested waters, even though everyone around him warns him not to, and he just INSISTS, and then of course gets eaten...okay, is the shark the bad guy here?Thousands of young people disappeared in Chile when the movie takes place, and yes, American hands were bloodied in that upheaval. At the same time, there were sound reasons to try to contain Marxism in this hemisphere.  The ends don't justify the means, but this is the way Chileans played the game on their own turf, so I don't know how much input or control our guys actually had.Charlie learned the hard way that you don't poke a stick into a hornets' nest. And the ""I'm an American"" entitlement argument? If you're an American, you should know better than to assume safety while traipsing around 3rd World countries on the verge of collapse.",2,MISSING....balance and objectivity,1249948800,"08 11, 2009",2009,2977,"['film', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'originally', 'intended', 'left-wing', 'propaganda', 'reviewers', 'contend', 'not', 'may', 'just', 'be', 'Costa-Gavras', 'simplistic', 'worldview', 'not', 'necessarilly', 'left', 'right', 'wing', 'definitely', 'victim-centric.It', 'essentially', 'example', 'being', 'dumb', 'enough', 'get', 'something', 'WAY', 'head', 'not', 'surviving', 'tell', 'it.Charles/Charlie', 'Hormann', 'Charles', 'dad', 'Charlie', 'wife', 'writes', 'snoops', 'South', 'American', 'country', 'Chile', 'maybe', 'wink', 'wink', 'imploding', 'civil', 'war', 'military', 'regime', 'just', 'overthrown', 'kind', 'compassionate', 'Marxists', 'who', 'were', 'most', 'recently', 'power', 'Charlie', 'when', 'not', 'working', 'illustrated', 'fable', 'starring', 'duck', 'yes', 'sensitive', 'artistic', 'little', 'road', 'trip', 'guy', 'who', 'may', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'wearing', 't-shirt', 'AM', 'CIA', 'ASSASSIN', 'Here', 'card', 'case', 'want', 'someone', 'whacked', 'Charlie', 'person', 'questions', 'political', 'nature', 'clumsily', 'trying', 'get', 'information', 'coup', 'instead', 'marking', 'troublemaker.Because', 'CIA', 'usually', 'what', 'doing', 'Charlie', 'then', 'COULD', 'IT', 'HAVE', 'SOMETHING', 'TO', 'DO', 'WITH', 'HIS', 'STUPIDITY', 'dad', 'flies', 'down', 'really', 'best', 'aspect', 'film', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'great', 'Mr.', 'Hormann', 'first', 'American', 'government', 'represented', 'embassy', 'personnel', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'when', 'Sergeant', 'Schulz-like', 'claim', 'know', 'NOTHING', 'eventually', 'obvious', ""'re"", 'just', 'trying', 'be', 'nice', 'cooperative', 'Mr.', 'Hormann', 'back', 'home', 'only', 'Hormann', 'more', 'determined', 'daughter-in-law/Charlie', 'wife', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'authorities', 'cynicism', 'hostility', 'Hormann', 'eventually', 'see', 'reasons', 'Eventually', 'Mr.', 'Hormann', 'admit', 'country', 'representatives', 'may', 'be', 'up', 'good', 'Charlie', 'was', 'indeed', 'victim', 'foul', 'play.Your', 'heart', 'really', 'out', 'Lemmon', 'when', 'ambassador', 'just', 'want', 'boy', 'back', 'sympathy', 'Charlie', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'equivalent', 'person', 'who', 'go', 'swimming', 'shark-infested', 'waters', 'even', 'everyone', 'not', 'just', 'INSISTS', 'then', 'course', 'eaten', 'okay', 'shark', 'bad', 'guy', 'here', 'Thousands', 'young', 'people', 'disappeared', 'Chile', 'when', 'movie', 'place', 'yes', 'American', 'hands', 'were', 'bloodied', 'upheaval', 'same', 'time', 'were', 'sound', 'reasons', 'try', 'contain', 'Marxism', 'hemisphere', 'ends', 'do', ""n't"", 'justify', 'means', 'way', 'Chileans', 'played', 'game', 'own', 'turf', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'input', 'control', 'guys', 'actually', 'had.Charlie', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'do', ""n't"", 'poke', 'stick', 'hornets', 'nest', ""'m"", 'American', 'entitlement', 'argument', ""'re"", 'American', 'should', 'know', 'better', 'assume', 'safety', 'traipsing', 'around', '3rd', 'World', 'countries', 'verge', 'collapse']",Missing VHS

202187,A2K3UTNW0783U6,6300182738,Phillip Kay,"[8, 9]","Missing is a 1982 film by Constantin Costa-Gavras (Z, 1969, State of Siege, 1972). All three films are factually based, and present the US role in support of terrorist right wing regimes in, respectively, Chile, Greece and Uruguay.As a result of the declassification of secret documents authorised by President Clinton this role is now documented comprehensively. Men such as J.D. Rockefeller II and his sons, Henry Kissinger, Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan and Bush (snr) and their administrations and organisations such as the CIA have been shown to have had strong affiliations with the Nazi Party in Germany, ex-Nazis in South America, the Mafia, and several drug cartels. These unholy alliances were apparently undertaken by the US government to combat the threat of Communism during the cold war. With the disintegration of the Communist USSR, it is disquieting to see the present administration in the US taking up the same alliances against a new threat, Islam. Co-incidentally, these alliances offered side benefits: massive profits by US corporations because of unstable economies in South American countries, huge personal fortunes raised by participation in the munitions and drugs trades, a rise in prestige and power of the military establishment, and the bolstering of political popularity by regimes who carried out little positive legislation for their nation. These operations (of course I am not referring to specific instances, but generalising) were taken for security reasons. Hindsight has proven them to be wrong. But those who will not learn from their mistakes are sentenced to repeat them.However it is not necessary to enter into the details of this background to understand or appreciate this film. To follow the plot, you need to know only that the socialist government of Allende was seen as a new hope for Chile, and attracted idealists from other countries wanting to participate in its social program; that these social changes were undermined by a worldwide inflation in the early 1970s which gave an opportunity for  the right wing military opponents of Allende to take control of the country (they had suffered a massive electoral defeat); that the US government was committed to overthrow the socialist regime in Chile and poured  11 million US dollars into the effort, as well as misrepresenting the situation to their electorate and the rest of the world; and that the dictatorship of General Pinochet resulted in 3,000 murders of alleged socialists and the imprisonment and torture of 28,000 more, with US government connivance.This is what is going on in the background of the film. If it was what the film was about, however, it would be a horrifying diatribe we would be reluctant to listen to or watch.The film instead is constructed around the amazing acting talents of Jack Lemmon, and he makes the film an overwhelming experience by giving one of his greatest performances. Based on a book called The Execution of Charles Horman, Costa-Gavros' script focuses on the search of Charles Horman's father, Ed (Lemmon) and Charles' wife Beth (Spacek) for the missing writer. The night time sets, with curfew in force, searchlights and helicoptors prowling, and frequent bursts of staccato machine gun fire, create a nightmare, desperate world familiar to all those who have seen Blade Runner.Throughout the film we are presented with the moral choice various characters make: how far will you go in support of what you believe in? If you believe socialism is ruining the country would you torture and murder socialists? If you think a new order will bring benefit to millions, would you risk your life and spend 17 hours a day bringing out a left wing newspaper? If you think it better that millions suffer to safeguard your own way of life, would you turn a blind eye to terrorism? If you love your son, would you attack your consulate officials for non co-operation in searching for him, and sue your government for complicity in  crimes against humanity after his death?(and if you think communism is a totalitarian regime that curbs democratic rights, would you engage in totalitarian means to combat it?)Because these questions are raised in this political context, it is important to distinguish fact from fiction. The facts presented are accurate, but they serve a dramatic, not documentary, end. The film is both a story of a search for a missing person, with artfully rising suspense and a powerful climax, and a study in relationships, chiefly between father and son, and father and daughter-in-law. Ed Horman only discovers his son after he goes missing, that is his tragedy. He has spent his life not seeing a lot of what he should have seen. His story thus echoes the political point that Costa-Gavras wants to make. It is our political right to be aware of the world we live in; failing that, we inherit a world we don't like at all. Further, there is a hint in the blossoming relationship between Beth and Ed that ideologies are for people, that people are not for ideologies. That no matter what you believe, you should commit to it, and that commitment should never, never, affect your ability to relate to other people in a positive, enhancing way.Those interested in the topic of this film might also like The Official Story (Luis Puenzo, 1985), concerning General Videla's reign of terror in Argentina. Videla came to power three years after General Pinochet, in 1976, with massive  support from President Reagan and his administration, who supplied funds, arms and training for his forces. Over 30,000 people perished, murdered, tortured, exiled or 'disappeared' during Videla's dictatorship. Again the motive was anti-communism: arms from the US, training from ex members of the Nazi party and funds from a mafia organised drug cartel (which was able to set up a profitable business in the country with, ultimately, disastrous results for young people in America). The Official Story stars the great Norma Aleandro, and is concerned with the profitable trade in babies carried out by Videla's regime, whereby political prisoners who were pregnant were delivered of their babies before being executed, and the babies then sold to wealthy childless couples in the administration. Over 500 babies are thought to have been sold in this ghastly trade. The human drama of a marriage that disintegrates under the suspicion that a member of it has been involved in the baby trade is the subject of the film while the political situation forms the background. Again, the moral choices of individuals is focused on: if your wife was desperate for a child, would you supply one if it meant murdering its real mother? Is this a violation of the trust you share with your wife? The film features a stunning performance from Aleandro (an exile).",5,The quiet American strikes again,1131235200,"11 6, 2005",2005,6798,"['Missing', '1982', 'film', 'Constantin', 'Costa-Gavras', 'Z',

Lemmon plays the father, and Spacek the wife, of an American citizen who goes missing during the early days of the military coup in Chile.  I think it's one of Lemmon's greatest roles, and the way that his relationship with Spacek evolves is both credible and moving. Director Costa-Gavras makes a political statement that's as powerful as the one he made in his classic film ""Z"" (another great movie, which received better treatment in its DVD release than ""Missing"").The video transfer is adequate, if not state-of-the-art.  The image lacks clarity, and the colors seem muted, but this fits the tone of the film.  The audio track is mediocre, and I found I had to frequently adjust the volume in order for it to be audible.The real disappointment with this DVD is the total lack of even the most rudimentary DVD features.  There is no menu.  You insert the DVD, and the film begins.  While there are chapters, there is no chapter listing anywhere, so you must move through them with the DVD's controls, not knowing where you will end up until you get there.There are no audio options (English mono only), no subtitles, and of course, no special features.  Even with the substandard DVD presentation, I still must give this 5 stars, because it's a film that I have always loved and couln't wait for it to appear on DVD.  I only paid $8 for the DVD at a local bookstore, so I am not really complaining, but be warned that this DVD gives new meaning to the term ""bare bones"".If you're a fan of the movie, you will probably get this while it's available, since it is unlikely that it will re-appear in a special edition.

202190,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,6300182738,Randy Keehn,"[3, 3]","I was an exchange student in Chile the summer of 1969.  There was already plenty of campaign grafitti all over the walls of Santiago.  It was easy to tell that the political emotions were high and the eventual winner would probably have no more than a 36% share of the vote.  I kept in touch with the politics (although I forgot to sell my few shares of Anaconda before the election).  I thought that a democratically elected Marxist president had great potential for international political understanding.  However, things took a major turn in 1973.Costa Gavras was just the director to bring this tale of political terror to the big screen.  ""Missing"" gives us a pretty real sense of what it may have been like in those days of retribution (for lack of a better word).  We see the story through the eyes of a father in search of his missing son.  The father, played excellently by Jack Lemmon, comes across as either apolitical or conservative.  His daughter-in-law, still living in the country she and her husband moved to in the enthusiasm many had for the Allende government, reveals the somewhat naive liberalism of she and her husband.  An odd couple (excuse the Lemmon pun), they set out to find their son/husband with the less than competent (or is it less than cooperative) help of the US enbassy officials.  The various individuals and attitudes they encounter gives us an idea of the coordinated chaos that the powers that be oversaw.  Along their journey, Lemmon gets plenty of insights to the precarious security that exists in the wake of a coup d'etat.The power of ""Missing"" is in Costa Gavras's ability to give the viewer a sense of the fear, desperation, exasperation and anger that Lemmon's character goes through.  We don't get any advance insight to what happens next and we are waiting for SOMETHING to happen just as the father is.  There are some points in which things may seem to slow down but it is purposeful; a reminder that waiting at a time like this is very nerve-wracking.I went back to Chile in 1985 to visit the family I stayed with.  Pinochet was still in power but things had relaxed greatly by then.  I expected to hear endless stories about the terror of the early days of Pinochet.

The film was controversial when it was released and the US State Department condemned the film, even though virtually everything about it is true. I really liked the film and as a paleoconservative who supports a noninterventionist foreign policy, I really like the way the film was made.The film's music is scored by Vangelis which I also liked.The role of Charles Horman is played by actor John Shea, known for his role of Lex Luthor in the TV Series ""Louis and Clark"". John Shea is also a friend and neighbor of mine at our summer home on Nantucket.The DVD is presented in a two disc set with many excellent special features. Disc one contains the film and the theatrical trailer.Disc two contains interviews with the film's director Costa-Gavras, Charles Horman's widow, Joyce Horman, producers Edward and Mildred Lewis, Sean Daniel, and author Thomas Hauser who wrote the source material for the film. Also there are video interviews with the cast and crew from the 1982 Cannes film festival, a video essay by Peter Kornbluh with information about the 1973 coup which shows some declassified US government documents about the coup and and the inquiry in to Charles Horman's disappearance.

Maybe it's that familiarity with the locale that makes Costa-Gavras' 'Missing' seem so authentic.More than just a startling vision of day-to-day life in the aftermath of a violent coup, there's much more of a feeling for the place and what ordinary people lost in the coup. There's a real sense of chaos in its imagery - dead bodies littering the streets as people try to go about their daily business or floating by in rivers, soldiers chasing and shooting at a white horse through deserted streets or diners on a rooftop garden leaving their means to watch a helicopter gunship shoot at unseen curfew violators. The sheer casual and irrational nature of violence (""You Americans always assume there has to be a reason"") gives the film a palpable sense of terror and dread: this is a place where even an earthquake can't get people out onto the dangerous streets after curfew.The fact that this time round Costa-Gavras had a Hollywood budget to play with helps immensely, but he also has a script based around people who aren't defined strictly by their politics - indeed, the movie is basically a search for `a political neophyte' by a gruff and unlikeable conservative (Jack Lemmon, on excellent form) and the missing man's wife (Sissy Spacek), a search that takes in embassies crowded with asylum seekers, morgues with hundreds of bodies piled almost haphazardly and the national football stadium that has been turned into a vast prison/torture chamber/place of execution. It's an outraged film but it's also one aware of its own impotence - this is a journey from hope to bitter and exhausted acceptance that there is nothing that an individual can do in the face of politically expedient mass murder.It's easily Costa-Gavras' real enduring masterpiece, having lost none of its power more than a quarter of a century on, and its sobering to think that there was a time when movies like this weren't just mainstream releases, they were also big box-office. It's just a shame that Universal's DVD is such a shoddy disc - it doesn't even have a menu page! This is a film that really does deserve the Criterion treatment (which it  will finally be  getting  later  in 2008), or a special edition at the very least (there's  already  one  available  in France).

Yves Montand starred in the highly acclaimed Gavras film &quot;Z&quot; about the takeover of Greece by a group of colonels in the nation where democracy began.  Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek star in the 1982 film &quot;Missing,&quot; which won the Gold Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival and secured an Oscar for Costa-Gavras and Donald E. Stewart for Best Adapted Screenplay.&quot;Missing&quot; has renewed significance now, twenty years after it was released,with increasing concern about General Auguste Pinochet, the Chilean strongman who came to power in a bloody coup in which the nation's elected president, Salvador Allende, was killed.  Recent efforts have been ongoing to try Pinochet as a war criminal, initially in Britain, and now in Chile.  Just last year the widow of the young American slain in the film filed a civil suit against Pinochet, while during the period of the movie's initial release the U.S. Ambassador to Chile at the time of the coup filed a suit in connection with the film.  Certain investigative efforts have linked the Central Intelligence Agency and International Telephone and Telegraph to the coup.  Meanwhile the Belgian government, which has investigated activities surrounding the coup, is seeking to talk to former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.Jack Lemmon plays the role of a New York City man who is conservative politically and a teetotaling practitioner of Christian Science.  His liberal, free-spirited son, who is seeking a career as a writer, has stopped in Chile while on tour of South America with his equally free-spirited wife, Sissy Spacek.  The timing could hardly have been worse from a danger standpoint in that the coup is taking place which brings Pinochet and his military regime to power.  When the young man disappears after his residence in Santiago has been ransacked, Jack Lemmon flies there to launch a search for his missing son.  Spacek, with whom he clashes, holds deep suspicions about the American foreign service personnel who purport to be assisting her.  At first Lemmon reprimands her for her rudeness to the Americans, but eventually sees things her way.  After his son's body has been discovered, Lemmon's last act before leaving Santiago with Spacek is to threaten a lawsuit against the American Ambassador to Chile and his subordinates.The &quot;odd couple&quot; aspect of Lemmon and Spacek as individuals who become kindred spirits due to the shared goal of learning what happened to a son and husband in the face of differing political and social viewpoints give the movie a compelling dramatic dimension.  The conflict between them and the American foreign service personnel is also handled with just the right dramatic touch, with the bitterness and distrust sometimes internalized rather than exploding on screen.  This gives the movie periodic subtlety to go along with the explosive moments when Lemmon and Spacek lose all patience with those who ostensibly claim to be helping them.",4,Caught in Political Intrigue,1010448000,"01 8, 2002",2002,3096,"['Greek', 'director', 'Costa-Gavras', 'made', 'specialty', 'selecting', 'film', 'projects', 'controversial', 'political', 'themes', 'Yves', 'Montand', 'starred', 'highly', 'acclaimed', 'Gavras', 'film', 'quot', 'Z', 'quot', 'takeover', 'Greece', 'group', 'colonels', 'nation', 'where', 'democracy', 'began', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'star', '1982', 'film', 'quot', 'Missing', 'quot', 'won', 'Gold', 'Palm', 'Award', 'Cannes', 'Film', 'Festival', 'secured', 'Oscar', 'Costa-Gavras', 'Donald', 'E.', 'Stewart', 'Best', 'Adapted', 'Screenplay.', 'quot', 'Missing', 'quot', 'renewed', 'significance', 'now', 'twenty', 'years', 'was', 'released', 'increasing', 'concern', 'General', 'Auguste', 'Pinochet', 'Chilean', 'strongman', 'who', 'came', 'power', 'bloody', 'coup', 'nation', 'elected', 'president', 'Salvador', 'Allende', 'was', 'killed', 'Recent', 'efforts', 'have', 'been', 'ongoing', 'try', 'Pinochet', 'war', 'criminal', 'initially', 'Britain', 'now', 'Chile', 'Just', 'last', 'year', 'widow', 'young', 'American', 'slain', 'film', 'filed', 'civil', 'suit', 'Pinochet', 'period', 'movie', 'initial', 'release', 'U.S', 'Ambassador', 'Chile', 'time', 'coup', 'filed', 'suit', 'connection', 'film', 'Certain', 'investigative', 'efforts', 'have', 'linked', 'Central', 'Intelligence', 'Agency', 'International', 'Telephone', 'Telegraph', 'coup', 'Meanwhile', 'Belgian', 'government', 'investigated', 'activities', 'surrounding', 'coup', 'seeking', 'talk', 'former', 'U.S.', 'Secretary', 'State', 'Henry', 'Kissinger.Jack', 'Lemmon', 'role', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'man', 'who', 'conservative', 'politically', 'teetotaling', 'practitioner', 'Christian', 'Science', 'liberal', 'free-spirited', 'son', 'who', 'seeking', 'career', 'writer', 'stopped', 'Chile', 'tour', 'South', 'America', 'equally', 'free-spirited', 'wife', 'Sissy', 'Spacek', 'timing', 'could', 'hardly', 'have', 'been', 'worse', 'danger', 'standpoint', 'coup', 'taking', 'place', 'Pinochet', 'military', 'regime', 'power', 'When', 'young', 'man', 'residence', 'Santiago', 'been', 'ransacked', 'Jack', 'Lemmon', 'there', 'launch', 'search', 'missing', 'son', 'Spacek', 'whom', 'deep', 'suspicions', 'American', 'foreign', 'service', 'personnel', 'who', 'purport', 'be', 'assisting', 'first', 'Lemmon', 'rudeness', 'Americans', 'eventually', 'things', 'way', 'son', 'body', 'been', 'discovered', 'Lemmon', 'last', 'act', 'leaving', 'Santiago', 'Spacek', 'threaten', 'lawsuit', 'American', 'Ambassador', 'Chile', 'subordinates.The', 'quot', 'odd', 'couple', 'quot', 'aspect', 'Lemmon', 'Spacek', 'individuals', 'who', 'become', 'kindred', 'spirits', 'due', 'shared', 'goal', 'learning', 'what', 'happened', 'son', 'husband', 'face', 'differing', 'political', 'social', 'viewpoints', 'give', 'movie', 'compelling', 'dramatic', 'dimension', 'conflict', 'American', 'foreign', 'service', 'personnel', 'also', 'handled', 'just', 'right', 'dramatic', 'touch', 'bitterness', 'distrust', 'sometimes', 'internalized', 'rather', 'exploding', 'screen', 'movie', 'periodic', 'subtlety', 'go', 'along', 'explosive', 'moments', 'when', 'Lemmon', 'Spacek', 'lose', 'patience', 'who', 'ostensibly', 'claim', 'be', 'helping']",Missing VHS
