Question: Why do that? Kids tell stories that are not true, real and imaginary stories are in newspapers and published in some books. Why do this here? There is no real footage, other than a few pictures here and there that probably can be found on the internet. So this is a bad thing about the episodes. Episodes are less than 20 minutes each and that is not something I am satisfied with. Too short. I only appreciate those real footages they used in their episodes and some of the new information I could get out of these episodes. This is why i rate it 3 stars. I also can easily understand now why people dislike ''Lost Tapes''. It's not the best, compare to other programs on this subject.In episode 4 some facts were given about ..

This set contains the same programming and deleted features as the original version. The difference in this release is in the editing. When Lost Tapes is brodcast, it often has a splash screen with the show's logo and episode title before and after commercial breaks (which are many). This is (to me) annoying and tends to disrupt the flow of the show. The first version on DVD contained the splash sreens. This new edition DELETES THE SPLASH SCREENS before and after the commericial cuts. The episodes flow better  and it is easier to follow the story without the annoying cuts. The logo splash is only at the beginning and end of the show. It is a great improvement.*******Lost Tapes is my favorite Animal Planet show. It tells stories of alleged creatures disputed by science with first person accounts in realistic settings. It is entertaining, but you don't often get a good look at the creatures. That is why I didn't give this season a five star rating. That was changed in Season 2. The shows producers upped the scare factor in the second season that is currently airing. I can't wait for that to come out on DVD. The first season does contain some good stories and I love the diversity of the casts and locales. The set contains two DVDs with seven episodes on each and some deleted scenes.Disc 1 contains:ChupacabraSkinwalkerMonster of MonterreyDevil DragonThunderbirdCave DemonsBigfootDisc 2 contains:Oklahoma OctopusDeath RaptorSwamp CreatureMegacondaHellhoundMothmanDeath WormMy favorites include Bigfoot, Death Raptor and the Swamp Creature. I had rented the first edition which contained the splash logos and it was sometiemes difficult to follow the action. It is more enjoyable to watch this fun show on DVD without the annoying splash screen cuts, as you can follow the story better. If you are thinking of buying this show, make certain that you get this version and not the first release.

1266493,A1VBMM3SCBOA9M,B002FOFX8I,B. Cooper,"[18, 23]","In the vein of Paranormal Activity, Blair Witch and (to an extent) Cloverfield, the Lost Tapes is another attempt to present ""staged handfilmed"" footage as if it were real. I first heard of this show from my mother who told me that it was based on true frightening accounts and included real video footage of legendary creatures.  Unfortunately, I believe that much of the acclaim this series has found is because a majority of its fans believe that the video footage is either real or a recreation based on real events.  Let me tell you that neither is true.  How do I know?  Because I wrote directly to Animal Planet.According to Animal Planet, these episodes are based on the ""possibility that these creatures exist.""  For example, there is a legend of Sasquatch roaming around parts of the US.  Animal Planet's writers think of a way that ""somebody"" might come into contact with the creature if it existed.  Then the writers determine what would be a feasible way that the animal would be captured on film if it ""did"" come into contact with somebody.  The combination of this setting and a reason for it being filmed generates the 15 minute episode.  The fact that the entire event is fictitious is not the real problem.  The problem is that the level of acting varies from good to mediocre without ever being great.  Most episodes are quite cheesy.  Some of them never even show the creature in question.  The camera becomes shaky, the actor drops the camera, and then you see them being dragged out of the view of the camera.  If this were a student film, I'd say it was a very clever concept for a low budget venture into filmmaking.  After spending $20, however, I'm not impressed enough by these works of fiction to say that I felt my money was well spent.At regular interludes throughout the fictional short the episode presents a few 30-60 second pieces of myth or speculation which are much more interesting than the core movie. Some of them are actually worthy of being in a documentary, such as Native American pictures of Thunderbirds, or pictures of Giant Snakes in different parts of the world. However, some of them are also simply useless.  The Oklahoma Octopus is one such example.  The basis of the episode is that many people drown each year in Oklahoma Lake.  That's it.  Absolutely no reason why they made an episode about an octopus.  In fact, I think it's rediculous to simply assume that an ""octopus"" is responsible, rather than make an episode about the location and what possible dangers it ""could"" be.This series lies in stark contrast to Animal Planet's rival show ""River Monsters.""  Every single episode from River Monsters is completely enthralling, entirely based around fact, and actually SHOWS the animal responsible for attacks. Please read my review on that series if you really want to know why I feel it is better.Overall, if you have seen this show and like it because you enjoy the fictional encounters with fictional creatures...then please go ahead and purchase the series.  If, on the other hand, you have not yet seen this series then please be wary.  It is very low budget, and nowhere on par with other shows on Animal Planet. I gave it 2 stars only because it has a little bit of where the legend began (about 2-3 minutes total) and has so many episodes.  I'll be giving this to mother and prepare myself for the next season of River Monsters.",2,"A Lot of Fiction, A Handful of Myth, and A Lack of Facts",1262476800,"01 3, 2010",2010,3392,"['vein', 'Paranormal', 'Activity', 'Blair', 'Witch', 'extent', 'Cloverfield', 'Lost', 'Tapes', 'attempt', 'present', 'staged', 'handfilmed', 'footage', 'were', 'real', 'first', 'heard', 'show', 'mother', 'who', 'told', 'was', 'based', 'true', 'frightening', 'accounts', 'included', 'real', 'video', 'footage', 'legendary', 'creatures', 'Unfortunately', 'believe', 'much', 'acclaim', 'series', 'found', 'majority', 'fans', 'believe', 'video', 'footage', 'real', 'recreation', 'based', 'real', 'events', 'Let', 'tell', 'true', 'How', 'do', 'know', 'wrote', 'directly', 'Animal', 'Planet.According', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'episodes', 'are', 'based', 'possibility', 'creatures', 'exist', 'example', 'legend', 'Sasquatch', 'roaming', 'around', 'parts', 'US', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'writers', 'think', 'way', 'somebody', 'might', 'come', 'contact', 'creature', 'existed', 'Then', 'writers', 'determine', 'what', 'would', 'be', 'feasible', 'way', 'animal', 'would', 'be', 'captured', 'film', 'did', 'come', 'contact', 'somebody', 'combination', 'setting', 'reason', 'being', 'filmed', '15', 'minute', 'episode', 'fact', 'entire', 'event', 'fictitious', 'not', 'real', 'problem', 'problem', 'level', 'acting', 'varies', 'good', 'mediocre', 'ever', 'being', 'great', 'Most', 'episodes', 'are', 'quite', 'cheesy', 'never', 'even', 'show', 'creature', 'question', 'camera', 'shaky', 'actor', 'camera', 'then', 'see', 'being', 'dragged', 'view', 'camera', 'were', 'student', 'film', ""'d"", 'say', 'was', 'very', 'clever', 'concept', 'low', 'budget', 'venture', 'filmmaking', 'spending', '20', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'impressed', 'enough', 'works', 'fiction', 'say', 'felt', 'money', 'was', 'well', 'spent.At', 'regular', 'interludes', 'fictional', 'short', 'episode', 'few', '30-60', 'second', 'pieces', 'myth', 'speculation', 'are', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'core', 'movie', 'are', 'actually', 'worthy', 'being', 'documentary', 'such', 'Native', 'American', 'pictures', 'Thunderbirds', 'pictures', 'Giant', 'Snakes', 'different', 'parts', 'world', 'However', 'are', 'also', 'simply', 'useless', 'Oklahoma', 'Octopus', 'one', 'such', 'example', 'basis', 'episode', 'many', 'people', 'drown', 'year', 'Oklahoma', 'Lake', 'Absolutely', 'reason', 'why', 'made', 'episode', 'octopus', 'fact', 'think', 'rediculous', 'simply', 'assume', 'octopus', 'responsible', 'rather', 'make', 'episode', 'location', 'what', 'possible', 'dangers', 'could', 'be.This', 'series', 'stark', 'contrast', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'rival', 'show', 'River', 'Monsters', 'single', 'episode', 'River', 'Monsters', 'completely', 'enthralling', 'entirely', 'based', 'fact', 'actually', 'SHOWS', 'animal', 'responsible', 'attacks', 'Please', 'read', 'review', 'series', 'really', 'want', 'know', 'why', 'feel', 'better.Overall', 'have', 'seen', 'show', 'enjoy', 'fictional', 'encounters', 'fictional', 'creatures', 'then', 'please', 'go', 'ahead', 'purchase', 'series', 'other', 'hand', 'have', 'not', 'yet', 'seen', 'series', 'then', 'please', 'be', 'wary', 'very', 'low', 'budget', 'nowhere', 'par', 'other', 'shows', 'Animal', 'Planet', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'only', 'little', 'bit', 'where', 'legend', 'began', '2-3', 'minutes', 'total', 'so', 'many', 'episodes', ""'ll"", 'be', 'giving', 'mother', 'prepare', 'next', 'season', 'River', 'Monsters']",Lost Tapes

If you want a more 'serious' take on the subject, I would suggest looking at 'Monster Quest' from the History channel.",2,Staged Footage About Cryptid Beasts,1331510400,"03 12, 2012",2012,696,"['was', 'expecting', 'actual', 'documentary', 'legendary', 'Thunderbird', 'instead', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'staged', 'act', 'done', 'purpose', 'sake', 'provoking', 'reaction', ""'what"", 'really', 'happened', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'thought', 'acting', 'was', 'convincing', 'enough', '1', 'star', 'came', 'was', 'just', 'little', ""'horror"", 'tape', 'three', 'young', 'boys', 'who', 'sneak', 'out', 'remote', 'area', 'skateboard', 'parents', 'permission', 'youngest', 'kid', 'up', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'giant', 'bird', 'never', 'seen', 'first', 'place', 'want', 'more', ""'serious"", 'take', 'subject', 'would', 'suggest', 'looking', ""'Monster"", 'Quest', 'History', 'channel']",Lost Tapes
