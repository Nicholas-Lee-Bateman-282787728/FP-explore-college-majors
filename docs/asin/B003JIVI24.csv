1347548,A953LCYAO95E1,B003JIVI24,Claudia47,"[1, 3]","This movie's storyline has promise. It could have been important, in the hands of experienced filmmakers with the resources to do it justice.  As it is, viewers are forced to follow amateurish, wooden actors as they attempt to emote their way through every imaginable cliche.I applaud the filmmakers' passion and the effort that went into trying to talk about the devastating consequences of bigotry. Unfortunately, the production values are so poor that the movie appears to have been put together by a bunch of kids who took a few film school courses, and borrowed some equipment. The result is way too many flashbacks, strange scenes that use lighting effects to set the mood, and odd, laggy sound. Even the background music feels contrived.As a contender in an amateur film festival, ""Change of Life"" would be interesting, but, when it has to compete with professionally produced and acted movies, it's outclassed.. And that's a shame, because, minus its hackneyed writing and cliched characters, this could have gotten its message out to many more people.",2,Important Message -  Awful Film,1389916800,"01 17, 2014",2014,1060,"['movie', 'storyline', 'promise', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'important', 'hands', 'experienced', 'filmmakers', 'resources', 'do', 'justice', 'viewers', 'are', 'forced', 'follow', 'amateurish', 'wooden', 'actors', 'attempt', 'emote', 'way', 'imaginable', 'cliche.I', 'filmmakers', 'passion', 'effort', 'went', 'trying', 'talk', 'devastating', 'consequences', 'bigotry', 'Unfortunately', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'so', 'poor', 'movie', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'together', 'bunch', 'kids', 'who', 'took', 'few', 'film', 'school', 'courses', 'borrowed', 'equipment', 'result', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'flashbacks', 'strange', 'scenes', 'use', 'lighting', 'effects', 'set', 'mood', 'odd', 'laggy', 'sound', 'Even', 'background', 'music', 'feels', 'contrived.As', 'contender', 'amateur', 'film', 'festival', 'Change', 'Life', 'would', 'be', 'interesting', 'when', 'compete', 'professionally', 'produced', 'acted', 'movies', 'outclassed..', 'shame', 'hackneyed', 'writing', 'cliched', 'characters', 'could', 'have', 'gotten', 'message', 'many', 'more', 'people']",Change of Life

I did not expect it to be about hatred, especially religious based hatred. I watch this type of film to try and understand why people would want to treat other people so horribly. Film is not simply to entertain, but to inform and create understanding. Gay cinema is always striving for understanding.
