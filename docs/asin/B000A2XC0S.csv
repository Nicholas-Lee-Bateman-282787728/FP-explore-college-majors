919609,AQBRMBQ99ESI7,B000A2XC0S,"John A Lee III ""jal3""","[20, 25]","This is not one of the Biography Channel's better efforts, especially in the beginning, but it does improve. The confusion at the beginning comes from the fact that a synopsis of the entire feud is presented in just a few minutes. After that, the progression of the feud is chronicled. The chronicling is done fairly well. The problem is that it is not readily apparent that the first part has ended and the second has begun. This leads to a bit of confusion, at least in me, as to what was actually happening. When it does become apparent, though, it is a quality program, though not the most interesting.The feud took place shortly after the Civil War. It was not the worst such event to happen in the area but it was the one that captured the imagination of the press. From these events, we get our modern stereotypes of the hillbilly hicks. To a great degree, the image was the construction of the press. Some things never change.",3,Begins with Confusion but Improves,1146182400,"04 28, 2006",2006,934,"['not', 'one', 'Biography', 'Channel', 'better', 'efforts', 'especially', 'beginning', 'improve', 'confusion', 'beginning', 'fact', 'synopsis', 'entire', 'feud', 'presented', 'just', 'few', 'minutes', 'progression', 'feud', 'chronicled', 'chronicling', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'problem', 'not', 'readily', 'apparent', 'first', 'part', 'ended', 'second', 'begun', 'bit', 'confusion', 'least', 'what', 'was', 'actually', 'happening', 'When', 'become', 'apparent', 'though', 'quality', 'program', 'not', 'most', 'interesting.The', 'feud', 'took', 'place', 'shortly', 'Civil', 'War', 'was', 'not', 'worst', 'such', 'event', 'happen', 'area', 'was', 'one', 'captured', 'imagination', 'press', 'events', 'get', 'modern', 'stereotypes', 'hillbilly', 'great', 'degree', 'image', 'was', 'construction', 'press', 'things', 'never', 'change']",N/A
