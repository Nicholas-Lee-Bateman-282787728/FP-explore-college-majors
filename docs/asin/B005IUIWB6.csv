This one was pretty good. It has been well received. As the parent though I will say this title can get really old/annoying if you end up playing it over and over! ""purple dog"" gets a lot of play around here. Some of the choices for the animals for the alphabet are a little strange, but don't seem to bother her as much as the do me.

Much better for that. However, this is a great companion video that reinforces concepts in a fun way. My two-year-old really enjoys it. My only drawback is the previews that go on and on and on and on and on. They didn't have any previews in the first Leapfrog videos I bought and these previews make it really hard to get to the main movie in the car where my daughter watches these.

I feel that Leap Frog does an excellent job putting these videos together. They seem to genuinely care about finding the best way to teach young children different lessons.That being said, I still think Letter Factory is the best one, followed by Words Factory. They just seem to really click with my son.Phonics Farm is very similar in terms of the lesson being taught when compared to Letter Factory, but Phonics farm doesn't do as good of a job in my opinion. Both videos are aimed at teach children their letter sounds. The one advantage that Phonics farm does have is that it acknowledges both the short and long vowel sounds. There is also an actually point made about vowels which was nice.All that being said, you probably won't be disappointed with many of the Leap Frog purchases.
