Well this is one of those movies that is just that.  It is a guy version of a chick flick and believe me, this movie has heart.While most people have never heard of this movie, it is a touching story about a man who raises his Grandson and remains there for him throughout his life when he needs him.This movie is about their relationship and the bond they share.  The love that is shown but as a man would.  While on the outside they might appear tough and gruff, it is in their actions and sacrifice that we see their true love shine.The acting is just top notch as well as the script.  It comes across as very real and authintic.This is one of my personal all time favorite movies.  It is real, it is touching, and no matter how many times I have seen it... I cry like a baby at the end.I would recomend this movie to anybody but especially men who had a father or grandfather that was very close to them.

The late Peter Falk manages to maintain a fair degree of individuality from amidst various forms of stereotyped elder-behavior. Julianne Moore shines as the grown-up grandson's wife, D.B Sweeney is good as the young lover and husband but struggles when forced to play a widower. Ellen Burstyn is allowed to stay just short of being the evil mother-in-law. Major problem is the rapid progress from childhood to top young surgeon for D. B. Sweeney's character. Peter Falk's character, Grandfather and great-grandfather simply requires an old person to go to an ancient. Little change but a certain slowing down and physical deterioration is required. He does it well. Sweeney, having to progress from childhood to a man who is expected to survive considerable difficulties is not given all the ammunition he needs to make the transition.All-in-all, I should think the average viewer over 60 will enjoy it.

Thisquality becomes greater when you experience a great movie with a loved one. That filmthen becomes one of your fondest memories.

It is very odd indeed that ""Room-mates"" wouldfall into this category. Despite the fact that you know one of the film's saddest moments isinevitable, it still affects you deeply. Even then, you are left with hope in your heart, andknow that these character's will endure. I love the subtle yet important messages itimparts.

This was that movie, it is a rare gem thatmanages to be genuinely heartwarming, without being sugary. It is a film I will never tireof because it themes are universal.
