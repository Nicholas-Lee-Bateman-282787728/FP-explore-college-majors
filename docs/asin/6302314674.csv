It claims to be a 90's version of &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and I guess that, unfortunately, would be accurate.  Whereas the Jimmy Stewart character in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; is  a genuine good guy who's honest and above board in all of his dealings, is  an honorable human being, believes in self sacrifice for his family,  friends &amp; neighbors and has a bit of bad luck; this movie's protaganist  is just the opposite.  This man is as dishonest as the day is long, tries  to get away with anything he can, from insurance fraud to cheating on  spouses - he would steal from his friends if he could get away with it.  Every bad thing he does turns out to be good luck for him.  This is a movie  about good things happening to a bad human being.  I have a feeling that if  the Jimmy Stewart charachter in &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; met up  with this guy, he would have nothing but comtempt for him.

It is truly a memorable experience.  I do hope it will be released on DVD.  It was obviously a 'sleeper' at the box office and didn't make much of a splash on cable, but it deserves a much wider audience as is attested by the 23+ perfect five-star reviews here on Amazon.com...Danny Aiello is an actor who deserves much more recognition than he ordinarily gets.  His style is so natural, that I think some people believe that he IS who he plays.  In the case of ""29th Street"", Aiello owned the character of the father.  He was exasperating, pushy and abrasive, but always totally believable.  There can really be no better tribute to an actor than to be able to say this.It is also a fine early role by Anthony LaPaglia who was very sympathetic in his frustrations at dealing with his father.  The interactions of the family plus the almost fairytale quality of the script was a great part of what made this such a wonderful movie.

307347,A2V3P1XE33NYC3,6302314674,Jeffrey Leach,"[30, 31]","Frank Pesce, although he has no reason to be, is upset. Frank just learned he won the first drawing of the New York State Lottery, netting himself a whopping six million dollars. But Frank leaves the lottery drawing without claiming the prize, then goes to a church and begins to throw snowballs at the building while lashing out at God. Cut to the local police station, where Frank begins to tell his story to the local cops, and what a story it is. Thus begins the movie ""29th Street,"" arguably one of the best films of the 1990's, and one of the least known. Starring such well-known actors as Danny Aiello, Anthony LaPaglia, and Lainie Kazan, this movie is both hilarious and touching in its depiction of a working class Italian family in 1970's New York.The problem for Frank Pesce is his lucky curse. From the day he was born, Frank repeatedly gets a lucky break in life. Frank gets out of bad situations due to luck; he wins at dice because of his luck; he cannot ditch a car for the insurance money because of his luck. Even worse, Frank's luck often has negative consequences for those around him, especially his father Frank, Sr. Frank, Jr. has no problem landing a job with local hoods for some quick cash while his father loses his trucking company and eventually his job driving a truck. Frank, Jr. wins at dice while his father is the archetypical chronic loser at any type of gambling. This lucky/unlucky dichotomy creates serious tensions between father and son, bleeding over into relations within the family.And what a family! The story really digs deep for ethnic humor while revealing a family that lives at the top of its lungs on a daily basis. This might be upsetting if it was not so funny. A discussion about the weather at the dinner table turns into a profanity laced shouting match. An argument about the cost of pizza turns into a running joke throughout the rest of the movie. But the funniest scenes of the film, without a doubt, involve the efforts of the Pesce men to, shall we say, profit from the ""loss"" of a car. By the end of these scenes, you will find yourself roaring with laughter. I am not embarrassed at all to say I laughed so hard I cried numerous times during the film.At the same time, the film poignantly shows the hardships of working class life. When Frank's father loses his company and his job, we see the adverse effects on the family and how it affects Frank, Sr. The whole business with the lottery ticket leads to painful confrontations that are not only unfunny, but also tough to watch due to the intensity of the performances. The seemingly permanent break between father and son does have a silver lining, as we see both Frank and his father prove their love for one another on the night of the lottery drawing. Ultimately, that is what this movie is about: the importance of family above all else.The overarching beauty of this film is Danny Aiello's performance as Frank Pesce, Sr. The sheer power of his performance shrieks Oscar, and his facial expressions and hilarious outbursts are spectacular to watch. You feel the pathos of Aiello's character in every onscreen movement, with every glance and word. Of course, all the other actors do a great job. The real Frank Pesce does a good turn as Frank's policeman brother.""29th Street"" is ripe for a DVD release. Do not be put off by the slightly cheesy Capraesque cover. This great movie deserves more attention than it currently receives. It is largely due to this film that I became a big fan of Danny Aiello, but I'm not sure he will ever top the performance he gives in this dandy picture.",5,Get in the Car!,1048291200,"03 22, 2003",2003,3606,"['Frank', 'Pesce', 'reason', 'be', 'upset', 'Frank', 'just', 'learned', 'won', 'first', 'drawing', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Lottery', 'netting', 'whopping', 'six', 'million', 'dollars', 'Frank', 'lottery', 'drawing', 'claiming', 'prize', 'then', 'church', 'throw', 'snowballs', 'building', 'lashing', 'out', 'God', 'Cut', 'local', 'police', 'station', 'where', 'Frank', 'tell', 'story', 'local', 'cops', 'what', 'story', 'Thus', 'movie', '29th', 'Street', 'arguably', 'one', 'best', 'films', '1990', 'one', 'least', 'known', 'Starring', 'such', 'well-known', 'actors', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'Lainie', 'Kazan', 'movie', 'hilarious', 'touching', 'depiction', 'working', 'class', 'Italian', 'family', '1970', 'New', 'York.The', 'problem', 'Frank', 'Pesce', 'lucky', 'curse', 'day', 'was', 'born', 'Frank', 'repeatedly', 'lucky', 'break', 'life', 'Frank', 'bad', 'situations', 'due', 'luck', 'dice', 'luck', 'can', 'not', 'ditch', 'car', 'insurance', 'money', 'luck', 'Even', 'worse', 'Frank', 'luck', 'often', 'negative', 'consequences', 'especially', 'father', 'Frank', 'Sr.', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'problem', 'landing', 'job', 'local', 'hoods', 'quick', 'cash', 'father', 'trucking', 'company', 'eventually', 'job', 'driving', 'truck', 'Frank', 'Jr.', 'dice', 'father', 'archetypical', 'chronic', 'loser', 'type', 'gambling', 'lucky/unlucky', 'dichotomy', 'serious', 'tensions', 'father', 'son', 'bleeding', 'over', 'relations', 'family.And', 'what', 'family', 'story', 'really', 'digs', 'deep', 'ethnic', 'humor', 'revealing', 'family', 'top', 'lungs', 'daily', 'basis', 'might', 'be', 'upsetting', 'was', 'not', 'so', 'funny', 'discussion', 'weather', 'dinner', 'table', 'profanity', 'laced', 'shouting', 'match', 'argument', 'cost', 'pizza', 'running', 'joke', 'rest', 'movie', 'funniest', 'scenes', 'film', 'doubt', 'involve', 'efforts', 'Pesce', 'men', 'shall', 'say', 'profit', 'loss', 'car', 'end', 'scenes', 'will', 'find', 'roaring', 'laughter', 'am', 'not', 'embarrassed', 'say', 'laughed', 'so', 'hard', 'cried', 'numerous', 'times', 'film.At', 'same', 'time', 'film', 'poignantly', 'hardships', 'working', 'class', 'life', 'When', 'Frank', 'father', 'company', 'job', 'see', 'adverse', 'effects', 'family', 'how', 'Frank', 'Sr', 'whole', 'business', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'painful', 'confrontations', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'unfunny', 'also', 'tough', 'watch', 'due', 'intensity', 'performances', 'seemingly', 'permanent', 'break', 'father', 'son', 'have', 'silver', 'lining', 'see', 'Frank', 'father', 'prove', 'love', 'one', 'night', 'lottery', 'drawing', 'Ultimately', 'what', 'movie', 'importance', 'family', 'else.The', 'overarching', 'beauty', 'film', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'performance', 'Frank', 'Pesce', 'Sr', 'sheer', 'power', 'performance', 'shrieks', 'Oscar', 'facial', 'expressions', 'hilarious', 'outbursts', 'are', 'spectacular', 'watch', 'feel', 'pathos', 'Aiello', 'character', 'onscreen', 'movement', 'glance', 'word', 'course', 'other', 'actors', 'do', 'great', 'job', 'real', 'Frank', 'Pesce', 'good', 'turn', 'Frank', 'policeman', 'brother', '29th', 'Street', 'ripe', 'DVD', 'release', 'Do', 'not', 'be', 'put', 'off', 'slightly', 'cheesy', 'Capraesque', 'cover', 'great', 'movie', 'more', 'attention', 'currently', 'largely', 'due', 'film', 'became', 'big', 'fan', 'Danny', 'Aiello', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'will', 'ever', 'top', 'performance', 'dandy', 'picture']",29th Street VHS

307351,AW3I97UR8NP7T,6302314674,"Karen Shaub ""Nickname:  Queen B""","[2, 2]","There's been a lot of grumbling of late over the mislabeling of films in an attempt to lure unsuspecting audiences into the theater or to trick them into taking home a dvd they normally wouldn't consider seriously. I fell victim to it myself with THE PRESTIGE, which sold itself as one thing but turned out to be science fiction instead--not that I have anything against science fiction mind you, in fact its one of my favorite genres. I simply hate being misled as do most people. But finally the blurb on the front of the dvd has told the truth! More or less. 29TH STREET, it procliams, is an ""absolutely delightful cross between GOODFELLAS and ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE"". Kinda hard to picture isn't it? What does that mean anyhow? Everytime a bell rings some goombah sleeps with the fishes? Not quite.Frank Pesce Jr. has always had The Luck, ya know? Even stuff that seems to be bad at the time it happens turns out to be a blessing for him. For example when he escorts his new Puerto Rican girl friend home one night her brother takes exception to their relationship and stabs him. Bad thing, right? Normally it would seem so, but in Frank's case its a good thing because they wouldn't have found the cancerous tumor in his lung in time otherwise--so getting stabbed and almost dying saved his life, see? His father Frank Sr. on the other hand is a born loser who doesn't let that fact keep him from gambling on everything that comes along, including the New York State Lottery. He may have lost his trucking busines and his job, but he's got a box of lottery tickets upstairs and one of them is sure to be a winner. He just knows it.29TH STREET is actually like GOODFELLAS a la Damon Runyon. There are no deaths and no violence, just the threat of some at one point. The crime is accepted as a barely noticeable fact of life in which the Pesce's engage themselves as necessary (attempted insurance fraud), and the mobsters are, well, quaint. You've got your bad mafioso in the shape of Louie Tucci who Frank Sr. constantly warns his son to avoid, but with little success since Tucci's way of earning money looks very attractive to young Frank. And then you've got your ""good"" mafioso represented by Jimmy Vitello's father (the ""biggest mobster in the Tri-state are"") who we never see, but the mere mention of his name causes the sea to part. As in Runyon the movie fairly teems with colorful characters like Frank's buddies Lenny Needlenose Nipton who's the very definition of post nasal drip and Dom the Bomb the neighborhood Sinatra who sings EVERYTHING.29TH STREET is a wonderful portrait of life in a typical New York Italian family where a simple question like ""How's the weather?"" can end up a screaming match loaded with expletives. A family where the father can't see spending a couple of bucks on a take out pizza so he's always whipping up his own home made delights in the kitchen while he waxes poetic about his tiny front lawn of ""the Bluegrass of Kentucky"". In short a family where inspite of everything love still reigns supreme. And then Frank Jr. screws it all up by winning the lottery! Which throws all of their lives into turmoil and causes a rift between father and son that may never be healed.There really is a Frank Pesce Jr. and he really did win the first New York State Lottery's prize of $6.2 million. He co-wrote the story the film was based on (along with the late James Franciscus, yes that one), and he also plays his own older brother Vito the cop. The screenplay was co-written by the film's director George Gallo. Gallo also has MIDNIGHT RUN on his resume and you can see the similarities between the two films instantly in the quick humor and the witty characterizations. The acting in this film is absolutely first rate. Lainie Kazan is wonderful in the pivotal role as wife and mother. But I simply can't say enough about the performances of Australian born Anthony LaPaglia and Danny Aiello as son and father respectively. There is absolutely no artifice between them, their relationship seems as real and genuine as anything ever commited to film. Its a shame that smaller films such as this are constantly overlooked at Oscar time for both of these men certainly turned in Oscar worthy performances.How much of 29TH STREET is based on Pesce's real life is hard to say, but whether its all based on cold, hard fact or complete fabrication, I can recommend this film whole heartedly to everyone who doesn't mind hearing a naughty word once in awhile.

I grew up near 21st Street, but never went to 29th Street, so I don't recognize any of the buildings.  I wouldn't anyway, considering that the movie was shot in North Carolina.One of the things I like best about this movie is the way the New York family relates to each other, the way they argue.  It had me rolling.  It reminded me of the way my wife got along with her father when he was alive.  They were at each other constantly but they still loved each other.You couldn't say anything to my father in law without getting into an argument.  If you said the weather was hot, he'd jump at you ""You're always complaining about the weather"".  If you said you just had a nice day he'd jump at you with ""You never do anything"".  He was just like the family in this movie.  He didn't mean any harm, but he just jumped all over everyone.  The only thing it was safe to say to him was ""How are you feeling?""  Just say that, and shut up.  You'll be fine.This movie reminds me a bit of O. Henry.  People make sacrifices for each other.The one complaint I have is that it is absurd to offer only $10,000 for a lottery ticket that is a ""finalist"", with a 1 in 50 chance of earning six million dollars.  Just do a little math.  Divide six million dollars by 50 to see what the ticket is worth before the drawing.  That's over $100,000.  How can anyone have the nerve to just offer one tenth of what it's worth?  And how can anyone be dumb enough to accept such a ripoff?  Then again, maybe the six million is paid over a lifetime, and the present lump sum value would be a lot less.  But still, $10,000 is chickenfeed when compared to a life-changing number like six million.I wonder what in this movie is true and what is fiction.",4,Some real New Yorkers in Carolina,1151971200,"07 4, 2006",2006,1808,"[""'m"", 'Queens', 'New', 'York', 'too', 'as', 'well', 'Brooklyn', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'grew', 'up', '21st', 'Street', 'never', 'went', '29th', 'Street', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'buildings', 'would', ""n't"", 'anyway', 'considering', 'movie', 'was', 'shot', 'North', 'Carolina.One', 'things', 'like', 'best', 'movie', 'way', 'New', 'York', 'family', 'other', 'way', 'argue', 'had', 'rolling', 'reminded', 'way', 'wife', 'got', 'along', 'father', 'when', 'was', 'alive', 'were', 'other', 'constantly', 'still', 'loved', 'other.You', 'could', ""n't"", 'say', 'anything', 'father', 'law', 'getting', 'argument', 'said', 'weather', 'was', 'hot', ""'d"", 'jump', ""'re"", 'always', 'complaining', 'weather', 'said', 'just', 'had', 'nice', 'day', ""'d"", 'jump', 'never', 'do', 'anything', 'was', 'just', 'family', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'mean', 'harm', 'just', 'jumped', 'everyone', 'only', 'thing', 'was', 'safe', 'say', 'was', 'How', 'are', 'feeling', 'Just', 'say', 'shut', 'up', ""'ll"", 'be', 'fine.This', 'movie', 'bit', 'O.', 'Henry', 'People', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'other.The', 'one', 'complaint', 'have', 'absurd', 'offer', 'only', '10,000', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'finalist', '1', '50', 'chance', 'earning', 'six', 'million', 'dollars', 'Just', 'do', 'little', 'math', 'Divide', 'six', 'million', 'dollars', '50', 'see', 'what', 'ticket', 'worth', 'drawing', 'over', '100,000', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'have', 'nerve', 'just', 'offer', 'one', 'tenth', 'what', 'worth', 'how', 'can', 'anyone', 'be', 'dumb', 'enough', 'accept', 'ripoff', 'Then', 'again', 'maybe', 'six', 'million', 'paid', 'lifetime', 'present', 'lump', 'sum', 'value', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'less', 'still', '10,000', 'chickenfeed', 'when', 'compared', 'life-changing', 'number', 'six', 'million.I', 'wonder', 'what', 'movie', 'true', 'what', 'fiction']",29th Street VHS

IF MORE PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT IT, MORE PEOPLE WOULD BUY IT.  IT IS A TRUE CLASSIC IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.  PLEASE READ MY REVIEW...AND OTHERS TOO....WHO LIKED THIS MOVIE.  THEY SAY THAT THE ""POOR ARE POOREST OF ALL IN SPIRIT.""  BY KEEPING THIS BOOK IN STOCK, AT A REASONABLE PRICE, YOU WILL HELP KEEP THE SPIRIT UP OF ALL THOSE WHO TREASURE THIS BOOK -- OR WOULD TREASURE IT!  IT IS A TRUE CLASSIC....AND EVERYONE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE SEEN IT, KNOWS THSI!!!!!THIS IS THE T R U E STORY OF A NEW YORK CITY LOTTERY WINNER.  One of the true gems of this movie is, in retrospect, the very first opening scenes,  which give the credits of this movie, and set the mood.  Because, you see, this movie was made BEFORE 9/11....and the opening scenes...which feature VERY close-up views of the World Trade Center Towers, (just as close-up as the tragic ones years later...but happily without people hanging out the windows)....are a nostalgic and somehow very hopeful highlight, all in themselves....Frank Pesce lives with his parents and his brother, who is studying to become a police officer.  Mr. Pesce, senior, (DANNY AIELLO), is an often-losing gambler, but still is a wonderful father to his two sons.  Frank Pesche,(ANTHONY LAPAGLIA) -- gifted with being inordinately lucky, throughout his young life -- buys a lottery ticket.  It wins -- but the mob wants it!  How the ticket almost goes to the mob....and especially, how it LEAVES the mob, forever -- is a tale of suspense, delight, close-knit family vibes, humour, and the ingenuity of ""everyday"" people.Playing the part of the lottery-winner's brother, (and playing it very convincingly and well, I might add), is the ACTUAL Lottery Winner himself!  Yes, lottery winner FRANK PESCE plays his own brother in this film -- and, seeing it, one hopes that he also played other roles, as well, (did he?).  He's not only now very rich -- but also very handsome, and a pretty good actor, too!All in all, this very TRUE, ""feel-good"" story of New York City is a delight to anyone with hope in his or her heart.  If hope does not abide within your heart -- see this movie and hope, (and love of family and laughter), will definitely begin to grow there, ready to be nurtured and turned into great things in YOUR OWN life!You can easily detect that everyone, in front of and also behind the scenes, had a great time in making this movie.  The script flows naturally, and the acting is superb.  So are the set designs, costumes, directing, camera angles and uplifting background music.Yes, the people who made this movie had a ""ball"" making it.

307356,A3JYW6GWR9CS5P,6302314674,"purerockfury ""Gorillas""","[8, 8]","Where does one begin on such an extraordinary movie? 29th Street has everything; comedy, drama, fantastic acting, memorable characters, Christmas, the mafia and the most amazing part is that not one iota of it is forced or crammed inside to attract a certain demographic. Every character and scenario plays off each other in a seemingly natural manner and the end result is a movie that has you laughing throughout and has you at near tears towards the end. It's the film equivalent of watching a real family deal with their problems and triumphs.First, the story revolves around Frank Pesce, an ambitious kid with huge dreams of being known for something remarkable. The problem lies in his lack of wanting to make it happen and more or less wanting it to fall in his lap. He basically skates though life unscathed after a series of very near misses, ranging from his getting stabbed in a bad neighborhood actually being the event that saves his life from a deadly disease to butting heads with a dangerous mafia don in an attempt to save his unlucky father's neck from being put on the chopping block. Amidst all of the chaos that he seems to shrug his shoulders at, he purchases a lone lottery ticket  for the first New York State Lottery along with a cheap pair of binoculars from a second hand store so he can cash a measly check and ends up becoming one of the finalists while his unlucky father collects them for months and comes up short.The acting is comprised of stars that get little by way of mainstream recognition but any true film fan will profess their undying admiration for them. The unambitious kid turned umbitious adult is masterfully portrayed by Anthony LaPaglia who has to this day become a major star but was more than deserving after this film. Danny Aiello, who already tops my list of greatest actors to ever walk the Earth, turns out my absolute favorite character ever in Frank Pesce Sr., the unlucky father who; despite being overworked and underpaid, remains optimistic that one day, everything will work out for the best. His simple wants and needs in life is a stark contrast to the overindulgent world we live in and his range of emotion is as powerful and believable as they are unmatched by the majority of Hollywood's hacks that get much more underserved recognition. Lani Kazaan is the ying to Danny Aiello's yang as Mrs. Pesce and she has the frustrated mother who outwardly protests being the homemaker on the surface but underneath it all, loves her husband and family more than enough to play that role and do it well down path. Like the rest of the main characters, her character feels so real that you want to reach into your television and touch them.Being not-quite-a-drama and not-quite-a-comedy without a lot of physical &quot;action&quot;, the dialogue is left to really move the story forward and the absolutely flawless script flows from each character's mouth so effortlessly that it's almost nauseating that this film never won an Academy Award. Never before have I watched a film not directed by Martin Scorsese have I been floored how the words add so much color to the overall piece. You cannot help but laugh at the frankness of evrey word spoken, especially if you have an ounce of Italian blood in you. It's almost like being at a family reunion.If you EVER get the opportunity to rent or buy this movie, do so. Calling it a mesh of &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; hits the nail on the head with deadly accuracy. You will feel equally at home watching this during an at-home mafia movie fest or after unwrapping gifts on Christmas.",5,A Fantastic Film In Every Sense Of The Word,1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,3620,"['Where', 'one', 'begin', 'extraordinary', 'movie', '29th', 'Street', 'everything', 'comedy', 'drama', 'fantastic', 'acting', 'memorable', 'characters', 'Christmas', 'mafia', 'most', 'amazing', 'part', 'not', 'one', 'iota', 'forced', 'crammed', 'attract', 'certain', 'demographic', 'character', 'scenario', 'plays', 'other', 'seemingly', 'natural', 'manner', 'end', 'result', 'movie', 'laughing', 'tears', 'end', 'film', 'equivalent', 'watching', 'real', 'family', 'deal', 'problems', 'triumphs.First', 'story', 'Frank', 'Pesce', 'ambitious', 'kid', 'huge', 'dreams', 'being', 'known', 'something', 'remarkable', 'problem', 'lack', 'wanting', 'make', 'happen', 'more', 'less', 'wanting', 'fall', 'lap', 'basically', 'life', 'unscathed', 'series', 'very', 'near', 'misses', 'ranging', 'getting', 'stabbed', 'bad', 'neighborhood', 'actually', 'being', 'event', 'life', 'deadly', 'disease', 'butting', 'heads', 'dangerous', 'mafia', 'don', 'attempt', 'save', 'unlucky', 'father', 'neck', 'being', 'put', 'chopping', 'block', 'Amidst', 'chaos', 'shrug', 'shoulders', 'purchases', 'lone', 'lottery', 'ticket', 'first', 'New', 'York', 'State', 'Lottery', 'cheap', 'pair', 'binoculars', 'second', 'hand', 'store', 'can', 'cash', 'measly', 'check', 'up', 'becoming', 'one', 'finalists', 'unlucky', 'father', 'months', 'up', 'short.The', 'acting', 'comprised', 'stars', 'get', 'little', 'way', 'mainstream', 'recognition', 'true', 'film', 'fan', 'will', 'profess', 'undying', 'admiration', 'unambitious', 'kid', 'turned', 'umbitious', 'adult', 'masterfully', 'portrayed', 'Anthony', 'LaPaglia', 'who', 'day', 'become', 'major', 'star', 'was', 'more', 'deserving', 'film', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'who', 'already', 'list', 'greatest', 'actors', 'ever', 'walk', 'Earth', 'out', 'absolute', 'favorite', 'character', 'ever', 'Frank', 'Pesce', 'Sr.', 'unlucky', 'father', 'who', 'being', 'overworked', 'underpaid', 'optimistic', 'one', 'day', 'everything', 'will', 'work', 'out', 'best', 'simple', 'life', 'stark', 'contrast', 'overindulgent', 'world', 'live', 'range', 'emotion', 'powerful', 'believable', 'are', 'unmatched', 'majority', 'Hollywood', 'hacks', 'get', 'much', 'more', 'underserved', 'recognition', 'Lani', 'Kazaan', 'ying', 'Danny', 'Aiello', 'yang', 'Mrs.', 'Pesce', 'frustrated', 'mother', 'who', 'outwardly', 'being', 'homemaker', 'surface', 'husband', 'family', 'more', 'enough', 'play', 'role', 'do', 'well', 'down', 'path', 'rest', 'main', 'characters', 'character', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'want', 'reach', 'television', 'touch', 'them.Being', 'not-quite-a-drama', 'not-quite-a-comedy', 'lot', 'physical', 'quot', 'action', 'quot', 'dialogue', 'left', 'really', 'move', 'story', 'forward', 'absolutely', 'flawless', 'script', 'flows', 'character', 'mouth', 'so', 'effortlessly', 'almost', 'nauseating', 'film', 'never', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Never', 'have', 'watched', 'film', 'not', 'directed', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'have', 'been', 'floored', 'how', 'words', 'add', 'so', 'much', 'color', 'overall', 'piece', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'laugh', 'frankness', 'evrey', 'word', 'spoken', 'especially', 'have', 'ounce', 'Italian', 'blood', 'almost', 'being', 'family', 'reunion.If', 'EVER', 'get', 'opportunity', 'rent', 'buy', 'movie', 'do', 'so', 'Calling', 'mesh', 'quot', 'Goodfellas', 'quot', 'quot', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'quot', 'nail', 'head', 'deadly', 'accuracy', 'will', 'feel', 'equally', 'home', 'watching', 'at-home', 'mafia', 'movie', 'fest', 'unwrapping', 'gifts', 'Christmas']",29th Street VHS

Schoonover ""Sue Yingling""","[2, 2]","29th Street is a sweet movie that is great to watch during the holidays since so much of it is set at Christmas time and it has a nice  message.  If it wasn't for the very raw language this could almost be a family film but then if the language was cleaned up it would not be a realistic story of this man and his life.  This is one of the handful of movies where the real life hero plays a smaller part in the film (in this case Frank plays his policeman brother).  The characters argue, curse and shout  but their love for each other shines through painting an endearing picture of blue collar New Yorkers in the 1970's.  A film that deserves to be more well known than it is.",5,Sweet Movie Based on a True Story,1168732800,"01 14, 2007",2007,678,"['29th', 'Street', 'sweet', 'movie', 'great', 'watch', 'holidays', 'so', 'much', 'set', 'Christmas', 'time', 'nice', 'message', 'was', ""n't"", 'very', 'raw', 'language', 'could', 'almost', 'be', 'family', 'film', 'then', 'language', 'was', 'cleaned', 'up', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'realistic', 'story', 'man', 'life', 'one', 'handful', 'movies', 'where', 'real', 'life', 'hero', 'smaller', 'part', 'film', 'case', 'Frank', 'policeman', 'brother', 'characters', 'argue', 'curse', 'shout', 'love', 'other', 'shines', 'painting', 'endearing', 'picture', 'blue', 'collar', 'New', 'Yorkers', '1970', 'A', 'film', 'be', 'more', 'well', 'known']",29th Street VHS
