876696,A21U04RIT5AUDJ,B00074DXEY,A Reader with Gratitude and Appreciation,"[16, 21]","Indigo is a very moving movie, speaking from an extremely intuitive, young, beautiful child who sees the world in a holistic way.  While I would say the movie is a little dramatized (yet without the dramatization, how would we start paying attention?), it brought me an eye-opening perspective about our gifted kids.  It is a movie attempting to bring awareness to our gifted children; therefore, it is impossible to bring every struggle, every perspective of the ""Indigo"" children into the lens of the movie.Isn't it so weird that nowadays, people have all kinds of names naming people's abnormal ways of seeing, sensing and feeling as some sort of an illness?  Schizophrenics, depression, bi-polar disorder, ADHD, ADD, etc.  You name it, and this list is expanding.  But the medical community, as well as the ""normal"" (who I would refer to as completely closed-minded people who are full of fear - cannot handle the thought of viewing the world in a different perspective) people use these as labels, illness to blame some of the most talented kids.  Mental illness, you might blame on it ... and chemicals in the brain is the part to blame.  But if you think deeper, this is not entirely true. How can we blame someone who has ADHD, ADD, depression if our community have been closed minded, distant and refuse to be loving and supportive?  Depression?  What is it?  What if I tell you while it can be an indication of a brain disorder, it could be the most important trigger for a person's spiritual/inner transformation.  And now, why are we naming these gifted kids as ADHD, ADD just because they are seeing the world in a different way ... having an inner sense of knowing?  Labeling is not even an option.  Indigo children, while it sounds way better than a disease, are still boxing our precious children in a box.  When will we be able to understand that every human being brings their natural talent and ability to the world, I ask?  Ever ask yourselves why you hear about the word psychic and intuition and many get freaked out?  Indigo, while it has the basis that it is the color of the gifted ones' aura, is still a word boxing human race, human minds.We as adults have a different role on our children nowadays.  We are no longer parents, big brothers, sisters who have absolute authority to make the kids to do things according to what we think the world should be.  We as adults need to be open, loving and connected to others and to our dearest kids.  Kids teach us so many things.  Just because we live in this rock long enough has no indication we are more spiritually evolved than our kids.  Kids can be great teachers, just as the elders.  Every human being's life has a lesson behind for us to reach out and to understand with an open heart.I used to live in that box.  I used to get very freaked out with kids, adults who are psychics and who have intuition.  I used to find lots of weird explanation - possessed by daemons, they are terribly sick; they are crazy as a way to explain who these people are.  But only to realize the above explanations I have are all rationalizations without any basis.  Why are we judging these kids?  Yes, maybe they need more special love and care.  Yes, maybe they are a little different.  Yes, maybe they are little more delicate for ""normal"" human beings to mold them and to coach them for success.  But it is also time for us to open our precious heart and be compassionate.  Listen to them without judgment; invite unconditional love, joy, peace and serenity for ourselves and to our wonderful kids.  Let us don't try to suppress their unique senses and gifts.  Please ... help them exceed their potentials and help our souls to be evolved to a more loving, compassionate stage.  Yes, it is going to be a little bit weird and hard to learn and to understand them.  But human brains have a great capacity for new learning and understanding; we just need to open our minds and hearts for it.",5,Inspiring and moving,1130025600,"10 23, 2005",2005,3952,"['Indigo', 'very', 'moving', 'movie', 'speaking', 'extremely', 'intuitive', 'young', 'beautiful', 'child', 'who', 'world', 'holistic', 'way', 'would', 'say', 'movie', 'little', 'dramatized', 'yet', 'dramatization', 'how', 'would', 'start', 'paying', 'attention', 'brought', 'eye-opening', 'perspective', 'gifted', 'kids', 'movie', 'attempting', 'bring', 'awareness', 'gifted', 'children', 'therefore', 'impossible', 'bring', 'struggle', 'perspective', 'Indigo', 'children', 'lens', 'movie.Is', ""n't"", 'so', 'weird', 'people', 'have', 'kinds', 'names', 'naming', 'people', 'abnormal', 'ways', 'seeing', 'sensing', 'feeling', 'sort', 'illness', 'Schizophrenics', 'depression', 'bi-polar', 'disorder', 'ADHD', 'ADD', 'etc', 'name', 'list', 'expanding', 'medical', 'community', 'as', 'well', 'normal', 'who', 'would', 'refer', 'completely', 'closed-minded', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'full', 'fear', 'can', 'not', 'handle', 'thought', 'viewing', 'world', 'different', 'perspective', 'people', 'use', 'labels', 'illness', 'blame', 'most', 'talented', 'kids', 'Mental', 'illness', 'might', 'blame', 'chemicals', 'brain', 'part', 'blame', 'think', 'deeper', 'not', 'entirely', 'true', 'How', 'can', 'blame', 'someone', 'who', 'ADHD', 'ADD', 'depression', 'community', 'have', 'been', 'closed', 'minded', 'distant', 'refuse', 'be', 'loving', 'supportive', 'Depression', 'What', 'What', 'tell', 'can', 'be', 'indication', 'brain', 'disorder', 'could', 'be', 'most', 'important', 'trigger', 'person', 'spiritual/inner', 'transformation', 'now', 'why', 'are', 'naming', 'gifted', 'kids', 'ADHD', 'ADD', 'just', 'are', 'seeing', 'world', 'different', 'way', 'having', 'inner', 'sense', 'knowing', 'Labeling', 'not', 'even', 'option', 'Indigo', 'children', 'way', 'better', 'disease', 'are', 'still', 'boxing', 'precious', 'children', 'box', 'When', 'will', 'be', 'able', 'understand', 'human', 'being', 'brings', 'natural', 'talent', 'ability', 'world', 'ask', 'Ever', 'yourselves', 'why', 'hear', 'word', 'psychic', 'intuition', 'many', 'get', 'freaked', 'out', 'Indigo', 'basis', 'color', 'gifted', 'ones', 'aura', 'still', 'word', 'boxing', 'human', 'race', 'human', 'minds.We', 'adults', 'have', 'different', 'role', 'children', 'nowadays', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'parents', 'big', 'brothers', 'sisters', 'who', 'have', 'absolute', 'authority', 'make', 'kids', 'do', 'things', 'according', 'what', 'think', 'world', 'should', 'be', 'adults', 'need', 'be', 'open', 'loving', 'connected', 'others', 'dearest', 'kids', 'Kids', 'teach', 'so', 'many', 'things', 'Just', 'live', 'rock', 'long', 'enough', 'indication', 'are', 'more', 'spiritually', 'evolved', 'kids', 'Kids', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'teachers', 'just', 'elders', 'human', 'being', 'life', 'lesson', 'reach', 'out', 'understand', 'open', 'heart.I', 'used', 'live', 'box', 'used', 'get', 'very', 'freaked', 'out', 'kids', 'adults', 'who', 'are', 'psychics', 'who', 'have', 'intuition', 'used', 'find', 'lots', 'weird', 'explanation', 'possessed', 'daemons', 'are', 'terribly', 'sick', 'are', 'crazy', 'way', 'explain', 'who', 'people', 'are', 'only', 'realize', 'above', 'explanations', 'have', 'are', 'rationalizations', 'basis', 'Why', 'are', 'judging', 'kids', 'Yes', 'maybe', 'need', 'more', 'special', 'love', 'care', 'Yes', 'maybe', 'are', 'little', 'different', 'Yes', 'maybe', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'delicate', 'normal', 'human', 'beings', 'mold', 'coach', 'success', 'also', 'time', 'open', 'precious', 'heart', 'be', 'compassionate', 'Listen', 'judgment', 'invite', 'unconditional', 'love', 'joy', 'peace', 'serenity', 'ourselves', 'wonderful', 'kids', 'Let', 'do', ""n't"", 'try', 'suppress', 'unique', 'senses', 'gifts', 'Please', 'help', 'exceed', 'potentials', 'help', 'souls', 'be', 'evolved', 'more', 'loving', 'compassionate', 'stage', 'Yes', 'going', 'be', 'little', 'bit', 'weird', 'hard', 'learn', 'understand', 'human', 'brains', 'have', 'great', 'capacity', 'new', 'learning', 'understanding', 'just', 'need', 'open', 'minds', 'hearts']","Indigo: A Film Of Faith, Family & An Extraordinary Child"
876697,ACXHNOC6L8LUO,B00074DXEY,Artist & Author,"[5, 7]","Although this is a fairly well-done movie, it is obvious that many of the actors are 'acting' - that is, they have not done enough acting to forget that they are acting instead of 'being the character.' It also raises some important spiritual issues, especially for families of faith.  To understand this movie, one must believe in what most people call the spirit 'world.'  [In this movie, they sort of likened it so some kind of Cosmic Internet.]  It is also important to understand that in that realm there are both good and evil spirits.  [We could not know what good spirits are if there were no evil spirits.]  In Judeo-Christian culture, God is the leader of the good spirits; Satan or the devil is the leader of the evil spirits.While I commend the movie makers for addressing such an issue, I think they should have made clear that there is both a good and dark side of human interaction with such spiritual forces.  I also think it should have been shown through some kind of established religious institution; it is through the experience and spiritual wisdom of one's spiritual body that one learns to recognize the good from evil spiritual forces.  The absence of such a foundation may leave one exposed to forces of evil they may not recognize if they try to 'play' with these spiritual forces.Within that context, it is a pretty good story.  It probably would have been better if the plot had been simplified and focused more on how little Grace was able to tap into the spirit world and even why she was able to do it.  Still, this movie should provide lots of discussion for traditional values families, especially families of spiritual faith.  There should be lots to talk about for families that don't believe in such spiritual forces, as well.",4,A Glimpse of the Spiritual World,1154044800,"07 28, 2006",2006,1763,"['fairly', 'well-done', 'movie', 'obvious', 'many', 'actors', 'are', ""'acting"", 'have', 'not', 'done', 'enough', 'acting', 'forget', 'are', 'acting', 'instead', ""'being"", 'character', 'also', 'important', 'spiritual', 'issues', 'especially', 'families', 'faith', 'understand', 'movie', 'one', 'must', 'believe', 'what', 'most', 'people', 'call', 'spirit', '[', 'movie', 'sort', 'likened', 'so', 'kind', 'Cosmic', 'Internet', ']', 'also', 'important', 'understand', 'realm', 'are', 'good', 'evil', 'spirits', 'could', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'good', 'spirits', 'are', 'were', 'evil', 'spirits', ']', 'Judeo-Christian', 'culture', 'God', 'leader', 'good', 'spirits', 'Satan', 'devil', 'leader', 'evil', 'spirits.While', 'commend', 'movie', 'makers', 'addressing', 'issue', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'made', 'clear', 'good', 'dark', 'side', 'human', 'interaction', 'such', 'spiritual', 'forces', 'also', 'think', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'shown', 'kind', 'established', 'religious', 'institution', 'experience', 'spiritual', 'wisdom', 'one', 'spiritual', 'body', 'one', 'recognize', 'good', 'evil', 'spiritual', 'forces', 'absence', 'such', 'foundation', 'may', 'leave', 'one', 'exposed', 'forces', 'evil', 'may', 'not', 'recognize', 'try', ""'play"", 'spiritual', 'forces.Within', 'context', 'pretty', 'good', 'story', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'simplified', 'focused', 'more', 'how', 'little', 'Grace', 'was', 'able', 'tap', 'spirit', 'world', 'even', 'why', 'was', 'able', 'do', 'Still', 'movie', 'should', 'provide', 'lots', 'discussion', 'traditional', 'values', 'families', 'especially', 'families', 'spiritual', 'faith', 'should', 'be', 'lots', 'talk', 'families', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'such', 'spiritual', 'forces', 'as', 'well']","Indigo: A Film Of Faith, Family & An Extraordinary Child"

Sounds like an awesome team to me.The story begins with Grace/Gracie, obviously a different child with interests and capabilities beyond that of most people. Very early in the movie, Grace speaks of beings that live in the trees, draws pictures of an energy grid in the sky, and ""sees"" things psychically.  There is obvious animosity between Grace's mother (Cheryl) and her mom's rich father (Ray).  Ray does not like or accept Grace's father (Alex). Ray's business has financial problems and he is a business-first, family-later guy. Ray gets a call from the police, when Cheryl gets arrested on a serious charge just at a time when people are protesting and blocking his next business venture involved with cutting down trees.  Of course, Cheryl has to wait in jail while Ray tends to business first, but the business goes belly-up.Fast-forward to 5 years later, and Cheryl is about to come up for a probation hearing. She is expecting to be released. Ray doesn't visit Cheryl in jail and he has no money. Alex is still evading the law.  Gracie is in a foster care home. Cheryl hears that Gracie may be in trouble, and calls Ray for help. When Ray goes to see Gracie, she tells him about being connected to other children by the ""web"" (NOT the internet), later referred to as the grid. Gracie continues to see into the future. It was too cool when she called her grandfather ""dimensionally challenged,"" because he only believed what he saw with his eyes. Anyway, Ray takes Gracie away, to protect her from danger. This is where Ray's journey with Gracie begins, and where you begin to understand what an ""Indigo"" child is.For some reason, the special features in the DVD wouldn't work, but that's OK.  I loved the movie.  There is also some beautiful high-altitude Oregon scenery in this video, combined with a beautiful story.  It may raise your consciousness a bit, or, if this energy-psychic business is not in your belief system, then you can just enjoy this as an uplifting story with beautiful scenery---but, it's so much more than that. There is also healing and spirituality in the story-line.

876702,A1L43KWWR05PCS,B00074DXEY,Lawyeraau,"[85, 92]","This is a low budget film, produced and directed by high budget, veteran film producer Stephen Simon, who is a co-founder of the Spiritual Cinema Circle, because he is interested in being involved in films that ask who we are and why we are here. The Spiritual Cinema Circle is intent upon paving the way for films that provide inspirational messages that uplift the lives of its viewers.This film is one such film. It revolves around the relatively new phenomena known as ""indigo children"". Indigo, a color that falls somewhere between blue and violet, is said to be the color of the life aura that emanates from those with psychic ability. It is the color used in connection with children who have heightened sensitivities and emotional complexity. They are said to be able to communicate telepathically with others like them,  and foresee events. Hence, the use of the term, ""indigo children"" has come into play when referring to these children.  These indigo children, for the most part, have been born over the last ten years or so. Due to their psychic gifts, they are often misunderstood by others. Some believe that they have been sent by God to help right what has gone wrong in the world.The film was co-written by self-styled Peace Troubadour James Twyman, the executive producer of the film, who is also the author of ""Emissary  of Light: A Vision of Peace"", which chronicles his 1995 life defining experience in the mountains of Croatia. He co-wrote the  ""Indigo Children"" script with Neale Donald Walsch, author of the best selling book, ""Conversations with God"", which spent about three years on the New York Times Best Seller List. Walsch also has a starring role in the film.The film focuses on a family in crisis. Ray (Neale Donald Walsch) is the patriarch of this totally dysfunctional family. He appears to be a well-to-do real estate developer of some sort for whom environmental concerns are low on the totem pole of his priorities. He also appears to be under a great deal of pressure from his financial backers. When his business eventually goes belly up, Ray is estranged from both his son and his daughter. So, when his daughter gets herself into some trouble and eventually entrusts her special daughter, ten year old Grace, to his not so tender mercies, Ray will begin a spiritual journey that will take him full circle.  Ray will not only learn that his granddaughter, Grace, is an ""indigo"" child, he will discover more about himself in the short time that he spends with her than he has in a lifetime.This is a film that is conceptually interesting. The problem with its deficiencies lies primarily with the script. The story is simply not really well-fleshed out. The viewer may know that Ray's children are estranged from him, but the reasons later proffered in flashback somehow seem too insubstantial to account for the intense animosity. There are a number of subplots, as well, none of which are developed to the point of being particularly meaningful. Moreover, the way that the viewer is given an explanation of the phenomena of indigo children is terribly contrived. There is little finesse in the way that the film delivers its message. Moreover, there is an amateurishness about the film, overall.Still, I thought Neale Donald Walsch was surprisingly good in the role of Ray, as he looked quite patriarchal. He infused the role with a great deal of credibility and was totally believable. The viewer cannot help but feel for him, which is why it is hard to believe the animosity that his son, daughter, and former wife harbor for him. The actress who plays ten year old Grace, Meghan McCandless, does what she can with the way that her pivotal role is written. It is a very two dimensional portrayal, as she exhibits none of the complexities often associated with indigo children. This lies more in the way in which her role was written, however, rather than any deficiencies on her part.Notwithstanding some of the film's shortcomings, it is a film that has its interesting moments. The concept of psychic gifts is not grounded here in science fiction but rather, in spirituality, which is an intriguing way to look at such. The film also does have some life affirming moments,  as Ray engages in self-realization about some of the choices he has made in life.  This is a film that was an Official Selection of the Durango and the Ashland Film Festivals.

876704,A2XGJ56VCFOKKZ,B00074DXEY,Nicholas Carroll,"[23, 26]","I rented this despite my skepticism and I really did want to like it. I do believe in Indigo children who are appearing more frequently as a desperate heavenly mandate to correct the growing problems of our world. The producers of this film set out on a noble goal to bring attention to this phenomenon. What they forgot was the story. From watching it, it was obvious to me that the writer created a story from an idea that he wanted to write about Indigo children, instead of developing a plot/story that features an Indigo child. There is a difference, and it clearly shows. The scenes were flat, the delivery was flat, the dialogue was stilted and the film as a whole lacks an emotional pull. Its a shame and I do hate knocking this film because of its important message...but sometimes making a film that is so focused on a message, it comes across as propaganda or didactic instead of an inspirational story that works. I would give it one star, but because this is a first attempt to bring attention to Indigo children and that the efforts of everyone involved is noble, I can't fault them for failing to deliver a more polished story.What we have is a story about an older man (in his 60s?) who has failed at being a good family man (though most of what we see is in flashbacks and still not compelling enough to convey just why his family dislikes him so). Somehow, his daughter gets mixed up in something and gets arrested, and its up to the father to look after her child, a precocious Indigo child. He's all logic and set in his ways, but she's mysterious wisdom who teaches him a few things. A bit hokey, especially when they meet up with another Indigo child with his mother, who's job in the script is to explain to the audience via a dialogue with the man just exactly who Indigo children are. Its a weak moment in the story and obviously contrived for our benefit.What I did like about the film was when the grandfather and Indigo girl get a ride with a group of teenagers on a road trip. Surprisingly to me, the teenage girls were the best actors in the film and had the best dialogue...not to mention that they were cute and funny. The other aspect of the film I enjoyed was the cinematography, all those beautiful shots of Oregon's great outdoors.I do agree with the intentions of the filmmakers and the Spiritual Cinema Circle to create spiritually minded films designed to uplift and inspire moviegoers. Unfortunately, they still need to work on their story development. I simply didn't find the plot of this film to be original, inspiring, realistic, or necessary. Until they release another one, there are better made spiritually-minded films to watch: ""Dragonfly"", ""Field of Dreams"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", ""The Others"", and ""I Heart Huckabees"" to name but a few. Supposedly ""The Celestine Prophecy"" movie has just finished filming and the ""Embraced by the Light"" movie is currently under production. Until then...we have to find inspiration in better crafted Hollywood productions.",3,Important topic subverted by a weak story,1118275200,"06 9, 2005",2005,3012,"['rented', 'skepticism', 'really', 'did', 'want', 'like', 'do', 'believe', 'Indigo', 'children', 'who', 'are', 'appearing', 'more', 'frequently', 'desperate', 'heavenly', 'mandate', 'correct', 'growing', 'problems', 'world', 'producers', 'film', 'set', 'out', 'noble', 'goal', 'bring', 'attention', 'phenomenon', 'What', 'forgot', 'was', 'story', 'watching', 'was', 'obvious', 'writer', 'created', 'story', 'idea', 'wanted', 'write', 'Indigo', 'children', 'instead', 'developing', 'plot/story', 'Indigo', 'child', 'difference', 'clearly', 'scenes', 'were', 'flat', 'delivery', 'was', 'flat', 'dialogue', 'was', 'stilted', 'film', 'whole', 'emotional', 'pull', 'shame', 'do', 'hate', 'knocking', 'film', 'important', 'message', 'sometimes', 'making', 'film', 'so', 'focused', 'message', 'propaganda', 'didactic', 'instead', 'inspirational', 'story', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'star', 'first', 'attempt', 'bring', 'attention', 'Indigo', 'children', 'efforts', 'everyone', 'involved', 'noble', 'ca', ""n't"", 'fault', 'failing', 'deliver', 'more', 'polished', 'have', 'story', 'older', 'man', '60s', 'who', 'failed', 'being', 'good', 'family', 'man', 'most', 'what', 'see', 'flashbacks', 'still', 'not', 'compelling', 'enough', 'convey', 'just', 'why', 'family', 'so', 'Somehow', 'daughter', 'mixed', 'up', 'something', 'arrested', 'up', 'father', 'look', 'child', 'precocious', 'Indigo', 'child', 'logic', 'set', 'ways', 'mysterious', 'wisdom', 'who', 'few', 'things', 'bit', 'hokey', 'especially', 'when', 'meet', 'up', 'Indigo', 'child', 'mother', 'who', 'job', 'script', 'explain', 'audience', 'dialogue', 'man', 'just', 'exactly', 'who', 'Indigo', 'children', 'are', 'weak', 'moment', 'story', 'obviously', 'contrived', 'benefit.What', 'did', 'like', 'film', 'was', 'when', 'grandfather', 'Indigo', 'girl', 'get', 'ride', 'group', 'teenagers', 'road', 'trip', 'Surprisingly', 'teenage', 'girls', 'were', 'best', 'actors', 'film', 'had', 'best', 'dialogue', 'not', 'mention', 'were', 'cute', 'funny', 'other', 'aspect', 'film', 'enjoyed', 'was', 'cinematography', 'beautiful', 'shots', 'Oregon', 'great', 'outdoors.I', 'do', 'agree', 'intentions', 'filmmakers', 'Spiritual', 'Cinema', 'Circle', 'create', 'spiritually', 'minded', 'films', 'designed', 'uplift', 'inspire', 'moviegoers', 'Unfortunately', 'still', 'need', 'work', 'story', 'development', 'simply', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'plot', 'film', 'be', 'original', 'inspiring', 'realistic', 'necessary', 'release', 'one', 'are', 'better', 'made', 'spiritually-minded', 'films', 'watch', 'Dragonfly', 'Field', 'Dreams', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'Signs', 'Others', 'Heart', 'Huckabees', 'name', 'few', 'Supposedly', 'Celestine', 'Prophecy', 'movie', 'just', 'finished', 'filming', 'Embraced', 'Light', 'movie', 'currently', 'production', 'then', 'have', 'find', 'inspiration', 'better', 'crafted', 'Hollywood', 'productions']","Indigo: A Film Of Faith, Family & An Extraordinary Child"

His books have changed my perception about life and God completely. He was born into this world for a purpose - to show humanity that God talks to all of us. However, he is no born actor and I really wish that this would be the last movie he will act in! (But he MUST continue to write more books!) Neale IS an American prophet of our present time. (Even God told that to him).Coming back to the subject on ""Indigo"", this movie shows all the viewers the possibility of other planes of existence. The central theme of this movie contains a great Truth about pure minded souls. These souls have the ""natural"" ability to communicate with angels and other souls from the astral world. Adults must NOT hinder their ability to do this as it would hamper the spiritual growth of the child. These Indigo souls will bring up the human consciousness of our planet and they are not to be feared. Those skeptics who doubt the existence of life beyond our physical universe are shutting themselves out from the Inner Voice which everyone actually hears but hardly listen to. Thus they view every spiritual phenomenon with contempt and disgust.The message this movie gives to the world deserves a 5-star rating. But on insight, the acting was not great (but NOT terrible) and the movie fails to state the reason why some children have this capacity of talking to angels and why most can't even think deeply about spiritual Truths. Other than that, this is a very touching movie which will definitely melt every heart which is pure and soft.",4,A movie of Truth accompanied by mediocre acting...,1119139200,"06 19, 2005",2005,1600,"['First', 'wish', 'state', 'am', 'big', 'fan', 'Neale', 'Donald', 'Walsch', 'books', 'have', 'changed', 'perception', 'life', 'God', 'completely', 'was', 'born', 'world', 'purpose', 'show', 'humanity', 'God', 'talks', 'However', 'born', 'actor', 'really', 'wish', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'movie', 'will', 'act', 'MUST', 'continue', 'write', 'more', 'books', 'Neale', 'IS', 'American', 'prophet', 'present', 'time', 'Even', 'God', 'told', '.Coming', 'back', 'subject', 'Indigo', 'movie', 'viewers', 'possibility', 'other', 'planes', 'existence', 'central', 'theme', 'movie', 'great', 'Truth', 'pure', 'minded', 'souls', 'souls', 'have', 'natural', 'ability', 'communicate', 'angels', 'other', 'souls', 'astral', 'world', 'Adults', 'must', 'NOT', 'hinder', 'ability', 'do', 'would', 'hamper', 'spiritual', 'growth', 'child', 'Indigo', 'souls', 'will', 'bring', 'up', 'human', 'consciousness', 'planet', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'feared', 'skeptics', 'who', 'doubt', 'existence', 'life', 'physical', 'universe', 'are', 'shutting', 'Inner', 'Voice', 'everyone', 'actually', 'hardly', 'listen', 'Thus', 'view', 'spiritual', 'phenomenon', 'contempt', 'disgust.The', 'message', 'movie', 'world', '5-star', 'rating', 'insight', 'acting', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'NOT', 'terrible', 'movie', 'state', 'reason', 'why', 'children', 'have', 'capacity', 'talking', 'angels', 'why', 'most', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'think', 'deeply', 'spiritual', 'Truths', 'Other', 'very', 'touching', 'movie', 'will', 'definitely', 'melt', 'heart', 'pure', 'soft']","Indigo: A Film Of Faith, Family & An Extraordinary Child"
