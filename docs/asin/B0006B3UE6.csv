Instead what I saw was nothing but pampered spoiled celebrities who did nothing but whine and complain as to how hard it was for them to slum it in other people's countries and homes.  It made me sick.Spoiler alert - This DVD wasted way too much time observing preparation of Mr. McGregor, Mr. Boorman, and crew.  It was pathetic when they threw a baby fit that they did not get the motorbikes that they wanted.  It was wrong that they got a free trip, filming, and promotional items, when they can easily pay for it themselves, just because they are actors.  Their egos were way out of line with the Russian consultants.  It was absurd that they paid off the boarder guards and were not arrested for bribing them in the first place!  Charlie accidentally splashed gas into Ewan's eyes.  The producer (I think that was his title.) said that this could be the end of the trip, if not then a serious delay, with no regards to Ewan's safety, wellbeing, or eyesight!  I got so tired of hearing Charlie complaining about the roads and the mud.  He said that if you planted explosives there you still couldn't destroy the road as much as it's destroyed.  He had no compassion for the people who have to live there and actually use the roads on a regular basis....and that was just disk one. I could not stomach it any longer to even watch disk two.Please avoid this DVD like the plague.

864868,AORW1FRF4D4KS,B0006B3UE6,azindn,"[15, 47]","I have a love-hate dilemma with this docu made for TV special for several reasons. As a enormous fan of Ewan McGregor, the principle of a trip to experience the world seems a great notion, however, there is more to this story than simply two blokes out for a lark on bikes. This much touted adventure for the extreme sports fans as well featured the star and his best friend, actor Charlie Boorman, on BMW motorcycles on an around the world vacation.Because of Ewan's star power, the pair are able to offset the cost of this adventure by hiring a television producer and charming companies to donate their equipment and services including two enormous BMW touring cycles, 4x4 SUVs, security equipment, camping equipment, designer duds for biking, tools, toolboxes, and the list goes on and on. They also had a contract with Bravo TV and a book deal in the bag. This is hardly a living off the land excursion, but an expedition that might turn into the ill-fated McGregor- Boorman Party.Most offensive perhaps, is the statement that the adventure was to raise awareness and monies for UNICEF charities for children, not to profit McGregor and Boorman. Whether this is true is never revealed and if funds were raised for the organization, it's not disclosed, however, the television commercials and internet exposure was worldwide, much to McGregor's surprise. He doesn't seem to understand how expansive power of the web worldwide and is constantly complaining about undo press coverage infringing on their annonimity although much preparation had been undertaken on their behalf to ensure their safety through host countries.Throughout the two discs set, McGregor and Boorman provide reality TV one-on-one interviews with their personal diaries of the day's activities. It is an informal discussion, usually provided after the pair have settled in for the evening and are about to retire. The humorous quips and obvious friendship and respect between McGregor and Boorman keeps the situation light, but as the conditions of the road deteriorate, so do the spirits of the star.While Boorman struggles to remain healthy and keep the pair on the road, McGregor is at the mercy of his own off-road inexperience, away from wife, kiddies, and his security blanket, it is his own inability to be of tougher stuff that is exposed. He whines, they both whine, and when it becomes almost intolerable, they meet situations and people who live so far below their upper middle class standard and pampered lifestyle it becomes obscene to complain without their seeming hypocritical.Although invited to share the food and homes of numerous kind folks along the way including Mongolian nomad herders, and other working class individuals, the experience of seeing the world as they've never known it is still trying for Ewan.  It is only when the pair is exposed to the remains of the soviet block countries is there the beginning of any reality check for the pair. Children dying of radiation exposure from Chernobyl, abandoned street urchins living under the streets to survive the cold, and nomadic herders are so foreign to McGregor he is at times embarressingly childish and unprepared for the reality of such hard lives.Only when the pair reach the United States, Alaska, through Canada, and into the northern states to NYC do the pair seem to relax among English speaking, cell-phone toting, westerners like themselves. But, it is during the hardship of the Road of Bones that McGregor seemed to finally grow up and with that experience under his belt, his entry to New York is a decided letdown.I enjoy the two personalities, but the premise of how the other half lives has an uncomfortable aura of such western privilege in the face of poverty that it makes for uncomfortable watching through most of the series.  Language is the least offensive of this documentary, the four letter words are actually refreshing.  It was the sense that into the world rides the prince of BMW-land, with kit, mate Charley, and camera crew in tow.  Just keep on truck'n, sir Ewan.",3,How the other half doesn't live,1142121600,"03 12, 2006",2006,4054,"['have', 'love-hate', 'dilemma', 'docu', 'made', 'TV', 'special', 'several', 'reasons', 'enormous', 'fan', 'Ewan', 'McGregor', 'principle', 'trip', 'experience', 'world', 'great', 'notion', 'however', 'more', 'story', 'simply', 'two', 'blokes', 'out', 'lark', 'bikes', 'much', 'touted', 'adventure', 'extreme', 'sports', 'fans', 'as', 'well', 'featured', 'star', 'best', 'friend', 'actor', 'Charlie', 'Boorman', 'BMW', 'motorcycles', 'world', 'vacation.Because', 'Ewan', 'star', 'power', 'pair', 'are', 'able', 'offset', 'cost', 'adventure', 'hiring', 'television', 'producer', 'charming', 'companies', 'donate', 'equipment', 'services', 'including', 'two', 'enormous', 'BMW', 'touring', 'cycles', '4x4', 'SUVs', 'security', 'equipment', 'camping', 'equipment', 'designer', 'duds', 'biking', 'tools', 'toolboxes', 'list', 'also', 'had', 'contract', 'Bravo', 'TV', 'book', 'deal', 'bag', 'hardly', 'living', 'off', 'land', 'excursion', 'expedition', 'might', 'turn', 'ill-fated', 'McGregor-', 'Boorman', 'Party.Most', 'offensive', 'perhaps', 'statement', 'adventure', 'was', 'raise', 'awareness', 'monies', 'UNICEF', 'charities', 'children', 'not', 'profit', 'McGregor', 'Boorman', 'true', 'never', 'revealed', 'funds', 'were', 'raised', 'organization', 'not', 'disclosed', 'however', 'television', 'commercials', 'internet', 'exposure', 'was', 'worldwide', 'much', 'McGregor', 'surprise', ""n't"", 'seem', 'understand', 'how', 'expansive', 'power', 'web', 'worldwide', 'constantly', 'complaining', 'undo', 'press', 'coverage', 'infringing', 'annonimity', 'much', 'preparation', 'had', 'been', 'undertaken', 'behalf', 'ensure', 'safety', 'host', 'countries.Throughout', 'two', 'discs', 'set', 'McGregor', 'Boorman', 'provide', 'reality', 'TV', 'one-on-one', 'interviews', 'personal', 'diaries', 'day', 'activities', 'informal', 'discussion', 'usually', 'provided', 'pair', 'have', 'settled', 'evening', 'are', 'retire', 'humorous', 'quips', 'obvious', 'friendship', 'respect', 'McGregor', 'Boorman', 'situation', 'light', 'conditions', 'road', 'deteriorate', 'so', 'do', 'spirits', 'star.While', 'Boorman', 'remain', 'healthy', 'keep', 'pair', 'road', 'McGregor', 'mercy', 'own', 'off-road', 'inexperience', 'away', 'wife', 'kiddies', 'security', 'blanket', 'own', 'inability', 'be', 'tougher', 'stuff', 'exposed', 'whine', 'when', 'almost', 'intolerable', 'meet', 'situations', 'people', 'who', 'live', 'so', 'far', 'upper', 'middle', 'class', 'standard', 'pampered', 'lifestyle', 'obscene', 'complain', 'seeming', 'hypocritical.Although', 'invited', 'share', 'food', 'homes', 'numerous', 'kind', 'folks', 'way', 'including', 'Mongolian', 'nomad', 'herders', 'other', 'working', 'class', 'individuals', 'experience', 'seeing', 'world', ""'ve"", 'never', 'known', 'still', 'trying', 'Ewan', 'only', 'when', 'pair', 'exposed', 'remains', 'soviet', 'block', 'countries', 'there', 'beginning', 'reality', 'check', 'pair', 'Children', 'dying', 'radiation', 'exposure', 'Chernobyl', 'abandoned', 'street', 'urchins', 'living', 'streets', 'survive', 'cold', 'nomadic', 'herders', 'are', 'so', 'foreign', 'McGregor', 'times', 'embarressingly', 'childish', 'unprepared', 'reality', 'such', 'hard', 'lives.Only', 'when', 'pair', 'reach', 'United', 'States', 'Alaska', 'Canada', 'northern', 'states', 'NYC', 'do', 'pair', 'seem', 'relax', 'English', 'speaking', 'cell-phone', 'toting', 'westerners', 'hardship', 'Road', 'Bones', 'McGregor', 'seemed', 'finally', 'grow', 'up', 'experience', 'belt', 'entry', 'New', 'York', 'decided', 'letdown.I', 'enjoy', 'two', 'personalities', 'premise', 'how', 'other', 'half', 'lives', 'uncomfortable', 'aura', 'such', 'western', 'privilege', 'face', 'poverty', 'uncomfortable', 'watching', 'most', 'series', 'Language', 'least', 'offensive', 'documentary', 'four', 'letter', 'words', 'are', 'actually', 'refreshing', 'was', 'sense', 'world', 'prince', 'BMW-land', 'kit', 'mate', 'Charley', 'camera', 'crew', 'tow', 'Just', 'keep', 'truck', 'n', 'sir', 'Ewan']",Long Way Round
864869,A3H2KLAV0VLQ0K,B0006B3UE6,B26354,"[0, 0]","Exhilarating, funny, intelligent, shocking, and raw, Ewan and Charley take us along on their adventure of a lifetime on their BMW R1150 GS Adventure motorcycles. A heartwarming and intimate portrait of two best friends sharing an amazing journey together on the road, it feels like they take you right along with them on their travels. Ewan's constant, infectious laugh and Charley's feisty yet good-natured demeanor and comic facial expressions make them a hilarious and irresistible pair. Every day I looked forward to coming home from work and popping the latest episode into the DVD player to see where their adventure would take them next. From the Ukraine, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan to deep into Siberia on the disturbing Road of Bones (Stalin sent 20 million people to their deaths constructing it), they must traverse dangerous flooded river crossings that threaten to crush their vehicles and turn them back, and become helpless witnesses to a horrific bear poaching perpetrated by the very people who stop to help them, all nauseatingly caught on camera, of which later, Ewan and Charley reveal their true feelings of shock and disgust over the incident. Ewan and Charley have an enthusiasm for living life to fullest that is unmatched and completely addictive. They speak directly to the audience on camera through their diary logs that puts the entire program onto an intimate, personal level. If you enjoy travel programs, are a motorcycle fan, or a fan of Ewan McGregor, this is a highly informative and entertaining documentary of a journey of exploration on personal and geographic levels. I loved every minute and hope they take us on another journey in the near future. Other notables include their work with UNICEF and children's rescue, and adorable animal encounters (don't miss the beard-biting puppy in the DVD extras). And in addition, great music scoring with song clips from Radiohead, Massive Attack, Orbital, Stereophonics, and more.

Be it time or financial constraints, the barriers are often broad and appear unwieldy. So many times we have to experience the rest of the world vicariously via magazine articles or, in this case, a documentary.LONG WAY ROUND was the brainchild of actor Ewan McGregor (STAR WARS) and his longtime buddy Charley Boorman (ON EDGE), two men with a passion for motorcycling. One day they decide to give this round-the-world idea some wings by mapping out a course across the globe ...but instead of traveling by plane or rail, they decide to do it using two BMW motorbikes.Preparation for the trip starts months in advance as transportation is arranged, passports collected, boarder crossing ensured, and training of the two riders takes place (CPR, first aid, exercising, motorcycle training, Russian language classes, etc.)The trip begins in London, England and ends 115 days later in New York. The trip starts out well enough, with adequately paved roads and quaint villages. But the further east McGregor and Boorman travel, the less biker-friendly the way becomes. Smooth asphalt quickly gives way to pitted asphalt, then divot-riddled asphalt, then into dirt roads. Once into Mongolia, anything resembling a sustainable thoroughfare becomes completely blurred by bogs, riverbeds and stretches of absolute nothingness.Difficulty of traveling aside, the two bikers meet some of the most incredible people. Ewan McGregor being Ewan McGregor, he is initially seen as a hero, a movie-star bringing notice to these otherwise unnoteworthy locales. Police escorts pop-up out of nowhere and guide Ewan and Charley into small townships where parties await them in their honor. But, again, the further east our two journeymen head, the less this happens. In and out of Mongolia, they soon head up into Siberia where they encounter The Road of Bones, a stretch of road built by slave labor during Stalin's tyranny (many a dead slaves body rests somewhere beneath this road ...or so it is said). No one knows who Ewan McGregor is here.Pushing themselves to the limit, the two slush through wetlands, river crossings and some of the worst roadways in the world. Even a support crew that follows them has great difficulties, one time crashing their vehicle and nearly killing some of the passengers.Arriving 115 days later in New York, many viewers will breath a sigh of relief for Charley and Ewan. The intensity of the trip is well-spent on the audience, helping the viewer feel the pressure and difficulties of the route. But it also helps us see that what is often said to be impossible is, in fact, possible if you apply yourself hard enough.

Inspired byJupiter's Travelsthis documentary follows Charley and Ewan (and their cameraman Claudio) as they travel around the globe on BMW motorbikes, passing through Eastern Europe, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Canada and America.Their trip is jam packed with adventures of all kinds from gun toting mafia in Ukraine, raging rivers on the Road of Bones in far east Russia, to bike accidents on the roads of America. It's a test of character, endurance and machine as they cross every terrain imaginable.There are many reasons to love Long Way Round including the chemistry between Ewan and Charley, seeing heavy duty motorbikes in action or the idea of an epic adventure. I personally enjoyed seeing the project from inception to completion, watching as they pulled together their team, drew up their route and set off on a task they were unsure of completing. There's an innocence to this trip that their later adventures perhaps missed.Easily the best version of Long Way Down is the Special Edition and is worth the additional cost. The extra footage pads out the show to give it a more complete, less rushed feel. You can also get Long Way Round the book in multiple formats including abeautifully illustrated edition.If you enjoyed this you may also enjoy their other adventures includingLong Way Down,Race To Dakar,By Any Meansor By Any Means: Sydney to Tokyo.",5,Great documentary of an epic adventure,1269907200,"03 30, 2010",2010,1450,"['have', 'sense', 'adventure', 'then', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'must', 'have', 'DVD', 'Inspired', 'byJupiter', 'Travelsthis', 'documentary', 'Charley', 'Ewan', 'cameraman', 'Claudio', 'travel', 'globe', 'BMW', 'motorbikes', 'passing', 'Eastern', 'Europe', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'Kazakhstan', 'Mongolia', 'Canada', 'America.Their', 'trip', 'jam', 'packed', 'adventures', 'kinds', 'gun', 'toting', 'mafia', 'Ukraine', 'raging', 'rivers', 'Road', 'Bones', 'far', 'east', 'Russia', 'bike', 'accidents', 'roads', 'America', 'test', 'character', 'endurance', 'machine', 'cross', 'terrain', 'are', 'many', 'reasons', 'love', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'including', 'chemistry', 'Ewan', 'Charley', 'seeing', 'heavy', 'duty', 'motorbikes', 'action', 'idea', 'epic', 'adventure', 'personally', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'project', 'inception', 'completion', 'watching', 'pulled', 'together', 'team', 'drew', 'up', 'route', 'set', 'off', 'task', 'were', 'unsure', 'completing', 'innocence', 'trip', 'later', 'adventures', 'perhaps', 'missed.Easily', 'best', 'version', 'Long', 'Way', 'Down', 'Special', 'Edition', 'additional', 'cost', 'extra', 'footage', 'out', 'show', 'give', 'more', 'complete', 'less', 'rushed', 'feel', 'can', 'also', 'get', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'book', 'multiple', 'formats', 'including', 'abeautifully', 'illustrated', 'edition.If', 'enjoyed', 'may', 'also', 'enjoy', 'other', 'adventures', 'includingLong', 'Way', 'Down', 'Race', 'Dakar', 'Meansor', 'Any', 'Means', 'Sydney', 'Tokyo']",Long Way Round

Blackdeer,"[5, 5]","Ewan McGregor and Charlie Boorman ride motorcycles from London to New York the ""Long Way Round:"" east across the European and Asian continents, crossing into Alaska, through Canada and on to New York.  The trip is most adventurous across the Asian continent when Ewan and Charlie enter Kazakhstan, and continue along treacherous routes through Mongolia and eastern Russia.  As a consequence, five episodes of this seven-episode version are dedicated to the toughest part of this journey--leaving Alaska, Canada and the United States to be covered in the final chapter.  That's Ok however, as Ewan and Charlie treat us to extraordinary views of country and people seldom seen by Westerners.Kazakhstan is a bit humorous as the pair is greeted with local police escorts and just about every town official along the route.  Mongolia is fascinating as the duo encounter people living in the most barren places of the world.  The route gets very tough in areas and will satisfy adventurers' and motorcyclists' appetites for challenging situations as Ewan and Charlie negotiate rivers, bogs and very rough roads on their heavily-laden motorcycles.  The route becomes almost impossible in far eastern Russia when they ride the final leg to Magadan on the ""Road of Bones;"" a road manually constructed by prisoners.  Interrupted by rivers swollen from winter run-off, the team resorts to assistance from hardy Russian truckers who travel the route--sort of a reality ""Wages of Fear (1955 movie).""Motorcyclists will enjoy this show as Ewan and Charlie each ride an R 1150 GS Adventure, BMW's famous large displacement dual-sport motorcycle.  It's an interesting study to watch their preparations for the trip and the numerous problems--mechanical and environmental--they solve to get to New York.  A fascinating event is their original choice to ride KTMs, which falls through after that company feels they'll be unsuccessful.  BMW steps up to sponsor Ewan and Charlie, and leaves an interesting debate for brand fans to ponder how KTMs would have fared on this trip.  BMW proves their quality as the bikes motor-on under excessive loads, extreme temperatures, deep water and numerous tumbles.  I'm a KTM fan, but have to concede admiration for BMW and their decision to support McGregor and Boorman on such an arduous trek.",5,Excellent Show for Adventurers and Motorcyclists,1134864000,"12 18, 2005",2005,2313,"['Ewan', 'McGregor', 'Charlie', 'Boorman', 'ride', 'motorcycles', 'London', 'New', 'York', 'Long', 'Way', 'Round', 'European', 'Asian', 'continents', 'crossing', 'Alaska', 'Canada', 'New', 'York', 'trip', 'most', 'adventurous', 'Asian', 'continent', 'when', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'enter', 'Kazakhstan', 'continue', 'along', 'treacherous', 'routes', 'Mongolia', 'eastern', 'Russia', 'consequence', 'five', 'episodes', 'seven-episode', 'version', 'are', 'dedicated', 'toughest', 'part', 'journey', 'leaving', 'Alaska', 'Canada', 'United', 'States', 'be', 'covered', 'final', 'chapter', 'Ok', 'however', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'treat', 'extraordinary', 'views', 'country', 'people', 'seldom', 'seen', 'Westerners.Kazakhstan', 'bit', 'humorous', 'pair', 'greeted', 'local', 'police', 'escorts', 'just', 'town', 'official', 'route', 'Mongolia', 'fascinating', 'duo', 'encounter', 'people', 'living', 'most', 'barren', 'places', 'world', 'route', 'very', 'tough', 'areas', 'will', 'satisfy', 'adventurers', 'motorcyclists', 'appetites', 'challenging', 'situations', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'negotiate', 'rivers', 'bogs', 'very', 'rough', 'roads', 'heavily-laden', 'motorcycles', 'route', 'almost', 'impossible', 'far', 'eastern', 'Russia', 'when', 'ride', 'final', 'leg', 'Magadan', 'Road', 'Bones', 'road', 'manually', 'constructed', 'prisoners', 'Interrupted', 'rivers', 'swollen', 'winter', 'run-off', 'team', 'assistance', 'hardy', 'Russian', 'truckers', 'who', 'travel', 'route', 'sort', 'reality', 'Wages', 'Fear', '1955', 'movie', 'Motorcyclists', 'will', 'enjoy', 'show', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'ride', 'R', '1150', 'GS', 'Adventure', 'BMW', 'famous', 'large', 'displacement', 'dual-sport', 'motorcycle', 'interesting', 'study', 'watch', 'preparations', 'trip', 'numerous', 'problems', 'mechanical', 'environmental', 'solve', 'get', 'New', 'York', 'A', 'fascinating', 'event', 'original', 'choice', 'ride', 'KTMs', 'company', ""'ll"", 'be', 'unsuccessful', 'BMW', 'up', 'sponsor', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'interesting', 'debate', 'brand', 'fans', 'ponder', 'how', 'KTMs', 'would', 'have', 'fared', 'trip', 'BMW', 'quality', 'bikes', 'motor-on', 'excessive', 'loads', 'extreme', 'temperatures', 'deep', 'water', 'numerous', 'tumbles', ""'m"", 'KTM', 'fan', 'have', 'concede', 'admiration', 'BMW', 'decision', 'support', 'McGregor', 'Boorman', 'arduous', 'trek']",Long Way Round

Talk about captivating and my wife was hooked too!  We bought our own copy and an additional one for the father in law, what a show!The first couple of episodes are a little slow as Ewan and Charley go through the trials of getting the expedition setup.  What I was impressed with though was the amount of organising, planning AND training they did for the trip.  This wasn't about two guys who got it into their heads they could ride across the world and just set out the next day.  They did off-road bike training, BMW mechanical training, first aid AND survival training.Once the pair get on the road is when the interesting content of the series shines.  Daily video diary's and their shadow camera man gives us full doses of their every experience.  They stayed and dined with such a broad range of people including mafia with their guns, and Mongolian nomads in their yurtsSo many times I know I would have given up and turned back, and on a couple of occasions they almost did.  Bike problems, navigation problems, advice problems, RIVER problems, sometimes it was all a bit too much.  But with a support crew rendezvousing at key spots and their pride to show KTM that it could be done they kept pushing forward through incredible challenges.I don't want to go to the extent that these two did with their adventuring, but buying a cross tourer and heading for Australia's red centre has become mighty appealing.

What you may not like is reflecting on the show's realism, and the sheer expenditure that was made for these wealthy movie stars to do this trip.  Ewan McGreggor, for instance, is going to have a constant multi-million dollar revenue stream for the rest of his life, over Star Wars alone.  Yet, most of what these guys got for this trip was paid for by sponsors, wanting to get their products on TV.  So, the star power exerted on this show allowed these guys to do an unheard of trip around the world, for nothing or almost nothing, out of pocket.  Great advertising space for the sponsors, though, as the BMW adventure bikes have exploded in popularity since the show's release.Sure, movie stars live a glamorous life, but these guys didn't seem skilled enough to be deserving of a trip like this.  I'm sure that's what added to the entertainment and adventure, but gobs of money were poured into training for the trip that you or I will likely never be able to afford.  Not to say that realism or being deserving of something is ever what we see on TV, but this show tries to make this sort of trip look feasible to the semi-common guys.  It's not.All in all, it's television, so realism or budgetary considerations can't really be made.  That said, after spending the last 10 years as a skilled motorcyclist, it was kind of difficult to watch this show without some envy for the thousands upon thousands of dollars that were showered upon these guys for this trip, even though they're wealthy movie stars.Oh, and the show's intro and theme song was really pop-gooshy-sticky.

Sad to say that the first disc is rather boring having to sit and watch Ewan and Charlie overact as they don't get their way with some of the potential sponsors. But just when you're ready to give up on this film disc 2 changes all that!Germany, Czech-Republic, Slovakia are essentally stepping stones to the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and Russia segments of the film.I should add that being from Poland myself I understand some Russian, and I found it particularly humorous that Ewan and Charley were totally clueless when trying to communicate or even understand the language. In one scene an older gentlemen asks Ewan to join him for a beer and Ewan and Charley think he wants to cut Ewan's beard (Piwo pronounced pivo means beer in ALL the Slavic countries!)Aside from the lack of language skills and appreciation of Russian hospitality that Ewan and Charley find suspicious (and frankly most Americans would as well!) the film really has several emotional moments. (The Russian saying that 'having a guest in the house is like having God in the house' is sadly missed by everyone in this film including the filmcrew!).However, along the route the visit to the UNICEF office in Kiev, Ukraine to see all the children there still affected from the Chernobol disaster from exactly 20 years ago will bring tears to everyone eyes!From there the film gets better and better as Ewan slowly comes to the realization how shallow an actor's world can be sometimes!The scenery and river crossings in this film are like you being there - really amazing how these Russian truck drivers think this is just normal driving!!!All the superlatives that you've read in the other reviews even though they claim 'I loved this film' don't give you a personal insight of how great this movie is, but it is my hope that my review has persuaded you in making a decision to see this film.I will buy the 10 episode DVD version as well when it becomes available later this year.How many movies can you say that about?I know of only three in my life - The Blues Brothers (1980) Breaking Away (1979) and Cinema Paradiso (1989) Italian version",5,LWR,1145404800,"04 19, 2006",2006,2454,"['decided', 'pass', 'book', 'sounded', 'bad', 'scripted', 'movie', 'trailer', 'mean', 'how', 'many', 'problems', 'are', 'going', 'encounter', 'support', 'crew', 'following', 'ride', 'brand', 'new', 'BMW', 'motorcycle', 'following', 'route', 'mapped', 'out', 'case', 'purchased', 'DVD', 'would', 'give', 'better', 'glimpse', 'journey', 'Sad', 'say', 'first', 'disc', 'rather', 'boring', 'having', 'sit', 'watch', 'Ewan', 'Charlie', 'overact', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'potential', 'sponsors', 'just', 'when', ""'re"", 'ready', 'give', 'up', 'film', '2', 'changes', 'Germany', 'Czech-Republic', 'Slovakia', 'are', 'essentally', 'stepping', 'stones', 'Ukraine', 'Kazakhstan', 'Mongolia', 'Russia', 'segments', 'film.I', 'should', 'add', 'being', 'Poland', 'understand', 'Russian', 'found', 'particularly', 'humorous', 'Ewan', 'Charley', 'were', 'totally', 'clueless', 'when', 'trying', 'communicate', 'even', 'understand', 'language', 'one', 'scene', 'older', 'gentlemen', 'Ewan', 'join', 'beer', 'Ewan', 'Charley', 'think', 'cut', 'Ewan', 'beard', 'Piwo', 'pronounced', 'pivo', 'means', 'beer', 'Slavic', 'countries', 'Aside', 'lack', 'language', 'skills', 'appreciation', 'Russian', 'hospitality', 'Ewan', 'Charley', 'find', 'suspicious', 'frankly', 'most', 'Americans', 'would', 'as', 'well', 'film', 'really', 'several', 'emotional', 'moments', 'Russian', 'saying', ""'having"", 'guest', 'house', 'having', 'God', 'house', 'sadly', 'missed', 'everyone', 'film', 'including', 'filmcrew', '.However', 'route', 'visit', 'UNICEF', 'office', 'Kiev', 'Ukraine', 'see', 'children', 'still', 'affected', 'Chernobol', 'disaster', 'exactly', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'will', 'bring', 'tears', 'everyone', 'eyes', 'film', 'better', 'better', 'Ewan', 'slowly', 'realization', 'how', 'shallow', 'actor', 'world', 'can', 'be', 'sometimes', 'scenery', 'river', 'crossings', 'film', 'are', 'being', 'really', 'amazing', 'how', 'Russian', 'truck', 'drivers', 'think', 'just', 'normal', 'driving', 'superlatives', ""'ve"", 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'even', 'claim', 'loved', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'personal', 'insight', 'how', 'great', 'movie', 'hope', 'review', 'persuaded', 'making', 'decision', 'see', 'film.I', 'will', 'buy', '10', 'episode', 'DVD', 'version', 'as', 'well', 'when', 'available', 'later', 'many', 'movies', 'can', 'say', 'about', 'know', 'only', 'three', 'life', 'Blues', 'Brothers', '1980', 'Breaking', 'Away', '1979', 'Cinema', 'Paradiso', '1989', 'Italian', 'version']",Long Way Round
