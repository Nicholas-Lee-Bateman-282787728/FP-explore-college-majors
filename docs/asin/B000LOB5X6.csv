1039569,A2YV89MCZ6TNQS,B000LOB5X6,"A.S.Cian ""Movie Buff""","[1, 4]","Umrao Jaan had great potential to become one of the renowned classics of the world cinema, had the screenwriter and the director had the foresight to know when to end the movie.The plot had all the tools of a successful story, well told, superbly acted both by Aishwarya Rai and Abishek Bachchan.  They excelled themselves once more, projecting a great love, that never went stale nor it lost its intensity of passion. The essence of the movie was a love story that ended in tragedy and it should have never turned into a life story. When the couple parted and she returned home, to the brothel in Lucknow that should have been the end, for anything that came after that was anticlimactic and only tried the patience of the audience.A movie should only have one great climax scene, and that came with the crisis when Nawab Sultan disowned her.  Resolution should have followed immediately. We know that her life as we knew it ended there and possibly she became a living corpse. So why digress, diluting the effect of the climax adding another crisis scene, such as the rejection of her family?We all know that in a society that public affection is forbidden even to this day it is obvious that she could not go home again, so why bother to show it? And the purpose of the last wedding scene where she performed escaped me.  If it was to add another song it just served to bore the viewers.J.P. Dutta will be wise to edit the ending of the movie, making it shorter, and release it again for the sake of saving a great piece of art from permanent oblivion.Annie S.

A few reviewers mentioned that the movie was too long or that there were too many climaxes.  Hindi films typically average 3 hours because Indian audiences really get into the story-telling and the melodramatic love themes.Unlike a lot of Bollywood films, Umrao Jaan shows not one one streak of campiness.  The story is bittersweet and extremely poignant.  You can truly identify with Umrao Jaan's plight, but some Western audiences might miss that because they're conditioned to shorter length films and incongruency with the bright coloring.  Western films with dark themes tend to be dark overall:  dark mood, dark lighting, dark soundtrack--everything is dark.  Bollywood films don't follow this formula.  Sad films still have color to them.  Songs tend to be more melodramatic.  The characters often cry silently and part slowly from one another.  While their reactions are overtly sad, the feeling in the scene is very well conveyed.  I dabbed at my eyes a few times myself.  You don't see much poignancy in Western films lately which is a shame.The screenplay was superb.  Talk about unlucky.  This poor lady was just kicked to the curb by nearly everyone.  At least she was able to enjoy a few moments of happiness in her troubled life.  Your heart really goes out to her.  And I liked the ending.  It was not a cheater's ending.  What a challenging role, and Aishwarya Rai mastered it!  In fact, the acting was excellent all around.  Additionally, the dancing, costumes, cinematography,  bittersweetness, and lyrics to the songs were all in line with the theme of the story.  This film was very well done and thought through.  Next to Lagaan and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, this is my third favorite Bollywood film.This film deserves at least an award or two.",5,Unbelievable story!,1193011200,"10 22, 2007",2007,1866,"['story-telling', 'finest', 'Director', 'JP', 'Dutta', 'Oscar', 'so', 'Ashwarya', 'Rai', 'A', 'few', 'reviewers', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'was', 'too', 'long', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'climaxes', 'Hindi', 'films', 'typically', 'average', '3', 'hours', 'Indian', 'audiences', 'really', 'get', 'story-telling', 'melodramatic', 'love', 'lot', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'Umrao', 'Jaan', 'not', 'one', 'one', 'streak', 'campiness', 'story', 'bittersweet', 'extremely', 'poignant', 'can', 'truly', 'identify', 'Umrao', 'Jaan', 'plight', 'Western', 'audiences', 'might', 'miss', ""'re"", 'conditioned', 'shorter', 'length', 'films', 'incongruency', 'bright', 'coloring', 'Western', 'films', 'dark', 'themes', 'tend', 'be', 'dark', 'overall', 'dark', 'mood', 'dark', 'lighting', 'dark', 'soundtrack', 'everything', 'dark', 'Bollywood', 'films', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'formula', 'Sad', 'films', 'still', 'have', 'color', 'Songs', 'tend', 'be', 'more', 'melodramatic', 'characters', 'often', 'cry', 'silently', 'part', 'slowly', 'one', 'reactions', 'are', 'overtly', 'sad', 'feeling', 'scene', 'very', 'well', 'conveyed', 'dabbed', 'eyes', 'few', 'times', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'much', 'poignancy', 'Western', 'films', 'lately', 'shame.The', 'screenplay', 'was', 'superb', 'Talk', 'unlucky', 'poor', 'lady', 'was', 'just', 'kicked', 'curb', 'nearly', 'everyone', 'least', 'was', 'able', 'enjoy', 'few', 'moments', 'happiness', 'troubled', 'life', 'heart', 'really', 'out', 'liked', 'ending', 'was', 'not', 'cheater', 'ending', 'What', 'challenging', 'role', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'mastered', 'fact', 'acting', 'was', 'excellent', 'around', 'Additionally', 'dancing', 'costumes', 'cinematography', 'bittersweetness', 'lyrics', 'songs', 'were', 'line', 'theme', 'story', 'film', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'thought', 'Next', 'Lagaan', 'Hum', 'Dil', 'De', 'Chuke', 'Sanam', 'third', 'favorite', 'Bollywood', 'film.This', 'film', 'deserves', 'least', 'award', 'two']",Umrao Jaan

1039574,A2UJG6T6DOWKQF,B000LOB5X6,Jennifer Hopfinger,"[0, 0]","The film is a remake of a 1981 Bollywood picture by the same title and both are based on the 1905 novel Umrao Jaan Ada about the life of a famous courtesan in the Indian city of Lucknow in the mid-1800s. Real-life husband and wife Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai play the romantic leads--and they are as gorgeous together onscreen as they are off. Rai's portrayal of the hapless Umrao is creditable, but Bachchan brings little to his role, other than looking dashing in period attire and staring at his co-star like he wants to devour her. The film's biggest problem, however, is the lack of strong conflicts to drive the story, as it merely recounts a long series of tragedies that devastate Umrao. Still, the movie is set in an enchanting time and place in India's history, when Lucknow's brothels were the epicenter of culture. The sumptuous costumes and traditional dances alone are fascinating. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)",3,Worth Watching,1254009600,"09 27, 2009",2009,996,"['film', 'remake', '1981', 'Bollywood', 'picture', 'same', 'title', 'are', 'based', '1905', 'novel', 'Umrao', 'Jaan', 'Ada', 'life', 'famous', 'courtesan', 'Indian', 'city', 'Lucknow', 'mid-1800s', 'Real-life', 'husband', 'wife', 'Abhishek', 'Bachchan', 'Aishwarya', 'Rai', 'play', 'romantic', 'leads', 'are', 'gorgeous', 'together', 'onscreen', 'are', 'off', 'Rai', 'portrayal', 'hapless', 'Umrao', 'creditable', 'Bachchan', 'little', 'role', 'other', 'looking', 'dashing', 'period', 'attire', 'staring', 'co-star', 'devour', 'film', 'biggest', 'problem', 'however', 'lack', 'strong', 'conflicts', 'drive', 'story', 'merely', 'long', 'series', 'tragedies', 'devastate', 'Umrao', 'Still', 'movie', 'set', 'enchanting', 'time', 'place', 'India', 'history', 'when', 'Lucknow', 'brothels', 'were', 'epicenter', 'culture', 'sumptuous', 'costumes', 'traditional', 'dances', 'alone', 'are', 'fascinating', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket', 'American', 'guide', 'Indian', 'movies', 'Subscribe', 'Bollywood', 'Ticket']",Umrao Jaan

I still feel she comes out a little fake here and there, and granted, she can manipulate her eyes as much as technology manipulates the color of them. The worst part of the movie is Abhishek... he plays a very very lame Sultan, never seems to accomplish a genuine facial expression, and for some reason can't stand quite straight showing a hunchback. Shabana Azmi is just spectacular, as always. I am no expert in South Asian music and singing, but I am a musician and I found the music and the singer to be just exquisite! The photography is also outstanding, not to mention the perfect costumes. The dancing performances are good, but for some reason I find Aishwarya to be a little too technical with limited natural grace (I wonder how Madhuri Dixit would have uplifted this character with her limitless grace).I think the story (without watching Rekha's version) has a strong feminist message in the sense that Shabana's character was able to attain a very powerful position in society as a lonely woman. I know I know it is a brothel, but it is supposed to be a very high-profile one! For the time, the location and the whole setting of the story, the brothel I think represents a way in which women find enourmous power, voice and independence, even more than being a respected wife. At the end, women's arms are strongest around a man's neck right? In the microcosmos of the brothel, women are protected from the cruel oppresion of outside; beautifully explained by Shabana's character. The 'love' aspect is questionnable in real life; if any, it is South Asian society which has proven that infatuation-based love does not persist as much as reason-based relationships such as arranged marriages, and love as a result of time spent together, and not butterflies in the stomach. I think women at the brothel enjoyed of more liberties (artistic preparation, fame, jewels, fine dresses, great standard of living, servitude, and the option of choosing one's sex partner) the trade-off is the reputation of course. Looking at Ameeran's mother, and at Shabana's character, I think Shabana's had a much better life overall.Good movie, nice slow pace and very very enjoyable experience.",4,Very Enjoyable,1199318400,"01 3, 2008",2008,2255,"['am', 'not', 'such', 'fan', 'Aishwarya', 'performance', 'here', 'good', 'still', 'feel', 'out', 'little', 'fake', 'here', 'there', 'granted', 'can', 'manipulate', 'eyes', 'as', 'much', 'technology', 'color', 'worst', 'part', 'movie', 'Abhishek', 'very', 'very', 'lame', 'Sultan', 'never', 'accomplish', 'genuine', 'facial', 'expression', 'reason', 'ca', ""n't"", 'stand', 'quite', 'straight', 'showing', 'hunchback', 'Shabana', 'Azmi', 'just', 'spectacular', 'always', 'am', 'expert', 'South', 'Asian', 'music', 'singing', 'am', 'musician', 'found', 'music', 'singer', 'be', 'just', 'exquisite', 'photography', 'also', 'outstanding', 'not', 'mention', 'perfect', 'costumes', 'dancing', 'performances', 'are', 'good', 'reason', 'find', 'Aishwarya', 'be', 'little', 'too', 'technical', 'limited', 'natural', 'grace', 'wonder', 'how', 'Madhuri', 'Dixit', 'would', 'have', 'uplifted', 'character', 'limitless', 'grace', 'think', 'story', 'watching', 'Rekha', 'version', 'strong', 'feminist', 'message', 'sense', 'Shabana', 'character', 'was', 'able', 'attain', 'very', 'powerful', 'position', 'society', 'lonely', 'woman', 'know', 'know', 'brothel', 'supposed', 'be', 'very', 'high-profile', 'one', 'time', 'location', 'whole', 'setting', 'story', 'brothel', 'think', 'way', 'women', 'find', 'enourmous', 'power', 'voice', 'independence', 'even', 'more', 'being', 'respected', 'wife', 'end', 'women', 'arms', 'are', 'strongest', 'man', 'neck', 'right', 'microcosmos', 'brothel', 'women', 'are', 'protected', 'cruel', 'oppresion', 'outside', 'beautifully', 'explained', 'Shabana', 'character', ""'love"", 'aspect', 'questionnable', 'real', 'life', 'South', 'Asian', 'society', 'proven', 'infatuation-based', 'love', 'not', 'persist', 'as', 'much', 'reason-based', 'relationships', 'such', 'arranged', 'marriages', 'love', 'result', 'time', 'spent', 'together', 'not', 'butterflies', 'stomach', 'think', 'women', 'brothel', 'enjoyed', 'more', 'liberties', 'artistic', 'preparation', 'fame', 'jewels', 'fine', 'dresses', 'great', 'standard', 'living', 'servitude', 'option', 'choosing', 'one', 'sex', 'partner', 'trade-off', 'reputation', 'course', 'Looking', 'Ameeran', 'mother', 'Shabana', 'character', 'think', 'Shabana', 'had', 'much', 'better', 'life', 'overall.Good', 'movie', 'nice', 'slow', 'pace', 'very', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'experience']",Umrao Jaan

The story centers around an aging courtesan Umrao Jaan Ada who tells her life story to another poet through a series of flashbacks.The title character is played to convincing effect by Aishwarya Rai. It is not just her luminous beauty that shines through here - every facial expression, the lift of an eyebrow, her smile, her tears, are all beievable in conveying her character's emotions. The dance sequences were also very good - I never thought of Aishwarya as a great dancer until this movie, the movements are so natural, and authentic. Rekha, in the original was an amazing dancer too, and both in their own unique ways bring the character of Umrao Jaan to glorious life on screen.Umrao Jaan's love interest, Nawab Sultan is played convincingly by Abshishek Bachchan, and their on-screen chemistry practically sizzles [they are now a real-life married couple]. Each love scene is beautifully and subtly done, and comes across as tender with an underlying passion that is hard to miss.There are also secondary characters in this movie that deserve mention - namely, the brothel owner, Khanum Sahib, played by veteran actress Shabana Azmi. Her character's greed for wealth is also touched by some shred of humanity, and very well done. Sunil Shetty plays the dacoit who lusts after Umrao, and his character comes across as savage and ruthless whilst also tender when faced by Umrao's dazzling beauty and finesse.The songs are all beautiful, and the costumes and sets simply sumptuous. This is definitely one of the best Bollywood musicals to come along, enhanced by a compelling plot and credible acting.
