If you just wanted to watch the choreographed martial arts and sword play in it you MIGHT find it somewhat interesting but even that strains credibility for instance when the lead female character pulls a knife out of someone's stomach and there is not a drop of blood on the blade...HUH???  The plot was seriously lacking, the acting was sub par, the characters were one dimensional, the directing was terrible and I cannot imagine why I watched it all the way to the end. Definitely a B movie.  Save your time and watch something else, if you must watch it rent but definitely don't buy it.",1,Triad Wasteland,1330646400,"03 2, 2012",2012,667,"['expected', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'movie', 'just', 'was', 'not', 'there', 'just', 'wanted', 'watch', 'choreographed', 'martial', 'arts', 'sword', 'play', 'MIGHT', 'find', 'somewhat', 'interesting', 'even', 'credibility', 'instance', 'when', 'lead', 'female', 'character', 'knife', 'someone', 'stomach', 'not', 'drop', 'blood', 'blade', 'HUH', 'plot', 'was', 'seriously', 'lacking', 'acting', 'was', 'sub', 'par', 'characters', 'were', 'one', 'dimensional', 'directing', 'was', 'terrible', 'can', 'not', 'imagine', 'why', 'watched', 'way', 'end', 'Definitely', 'B', 'movie', 'Save', 'time', 'watch', 'something', 'else', 'must', 'watch', 'rent', 'definitely', 'do', ""n't"", 'buy']",King Of Triads

It's an overall cliche premise that deals with the families in the Chinese Triads. I have to say that the story is pretty disappointing. It begins to jump all over the place and it doesn't explain the purpose of the individuals fighting to become the head of the family.The martial arts choreography was the only good thing about this film. The talent in martial arts was high. Very fast and agile practitioners. It almost makes up for the rest of the movie, but it's not quite there.At best, it's a rental or a bargain bin purchase.",3,"Good Action, but Not Quite There",1334534400,"04 16, 2012",2012,582,"['gave', 'movie', 'shot', 'trailer', 'overall', 'cliche', 'premise', 'families', 'Chinese', 'Triads', 'have', 'say', 'story', 'pretty', 'disappointing', 'jump', 'place', ""n't"", 'explain', 'purpose', 'individuals', 'fighting', 'become', 'head', 'family.The', 'martial', 'arts', 'choreography', 'was', 'only', 'good', 'thing', 'film', 'talent', 'martial', 'arts', 'was', 'high', 'Very', 'fast', 'agile', 'practitioners', 'almost', 'up', 'rest', 'movie', 'not', 'quite', 'there.At', 'best', 'rental', 'bargain', 'bin', 'purchase']",King Of Triads
1517275,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B006MA5W2I,Mark Turner,"[2, 3]","There are great martial arts films, there as so so martial arts films and there are the truly bad martial arts films that make fans turn their DVD discs into shuriken. KING OF TRIADS falls into that last category. Try as I might I wanted to write something at least respective of those involved but I couldn't do so.Taking place in present time a gang leader dies and leaves his empire to his two children. But this doesn't set well with members of the gang who pretty much run things on their own, trying to take money and power from the siblings. Little do they realize who they're dealing with. And that about sums up the plot for this movie.Yes, there is a twist in the story that I won't spoil here for those who want to take the time to watch every martial arts film ever made, but it's not much of a surprise twist and it's not that satisfying as well. I'm not student of the genre but I've read reports that many of the stars in this film are some of the best in martial arts films but highly underused here. I don't think that's difficult to believe.A few of the action sequences are well done with a several decent fight sequences. But on the whole this film leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps there was much lost in translation when this film was dubbed but my guess is that's not the reason I didn't enjoy it that much. With the number of really good martial arts films out there to be seen from the classics to new releases, my advice would be to pass this one by. Short review? Yep it is but then something like this deserves it.",1,BLAND MARTIAL ARTS,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,1544,"['are', 'great', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'so', 'so', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'are', 'truly', 'bad', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'make', 'fans', 'turn', 'DVD', 'discs', 'shuriken', 'KING', 'TRIADS', 'last', 'category', 'Try', 'might', 'wanted', 'write', 'something', 'least', 'respective', 'involved', 'could', ""n't"", 'do', 'so.Taking', 'place', 'present', 'time', 'gang', 'leader', 'dies', 'empire', 'two', 'children', ""n't"", 'set', 'well', 'members', 'gang', 'who', 'pretty', 'much', 'run', 'things', 'own', 'trying', 'take', 'money', 'power', 'siblings', 'Little', 'do', 'realize', 'who', ""'re"", 'dealing', 'about', 'up', 'plot', 'movie.Yes', 'twist', 'story', 'wo', ""n't"", 'spoil', 'here', 'who', 'want', 'take', 'time', 'watch', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'ever', 'made', 'not', 'much', 'surprise', 'twist', 'not', 'that', 'satisfying', 'as', 'well', ""'m"", 'not', 'student', 'genre', ""'ve"", 'read', 'reports', 'many', 'stars', 'film', 'are', 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'highly', 'underused', 'here', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'difficult', 'believe.A', 'few', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'well', 'done', 'several', 'decent', 'fight', 'sequences', 'whole', 'film', 'lot', 'be', 'desired', 'Perhaps', 'was', 'much', 'lost', 'translation', 'when', 'film', 'was', 'dubbed', 'guess', 'not', 'reason', 'did', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'much', 'number', 'really', 'good', 'martial', 'arts', 'films', 'there', 'be', 'seen', 'classics', 'new', 'releases', 'advice', 'would', 'be', 'pass', 'one', 'Short', 'review', 'Yep', 'then', 'something']",King Of Triads
