Both characters are very well fitted into the movie. I liked Runner Runner from the start till the end, because it's easy watching movie with a lot of amazing views, luxury things, big dreams, great lifestyle and involving plot. This movie has a little everything, like drama, romance, action, fun, betrayal, crime and thriller. Such movies help me to dream build, because that's why I like them. I believe you won't be disappointed after watching this movie.What can you learn from this movie? It's that everybody has a weakness. Find it and you will own the deal! It's very important in life, because everyday we are making some kind of business or negotiations. Another thing that can be learnt from this movie is to dream big and play big.

1631953,A3TYC8T6W81DDB,B00BEIYPN0,C. Sawin,"[11, 15]","You should know going in that ""Runner Runner"" is not a good film no matter how you try to look at it. The most enjoyable aspect of the film is going into it thinking it's rated PG-13 and then being pleasantly surprised that it's actually rated R. Despite its rating, the film feels like a completely saturated version of the genre counterparts it likely borrows from. Films like ""The Sting,"" ""Casino,"" and ""Ocean's Eleven."" ""Runner Runner"" is like a tasteless alcoholic concoction that no amount of shaking or stirring could possibly add any sort of flavor to.Justin Timberlake can't seem to catch a break when it comes to acting. He may be a part of projects that initially have potential, but nothing has really gained any steam other than his performance in ""The Social Network."" ""Runner Runner"" is no different. While Timberlake is at the front of the pack, you never really seem to care how Richie's life ends up during the film. Most of that blame can be placed on the writers as Timberlake seems to do the best with what's in front of him, but if you're carrying a film it's your job to make the audience interested. You're the face on promotional material, you're the one doing every press junket, and the film's success will likely hinder on your performance. Timberlake does seem to have natural charisma, but it's as if he's too lackadaisical to fully capitalize on it and most of the films he chooses to star in suffer because of it.The film mostly feels like a never ending string of F-words thanks to Ben Affleck. When you first see Ivan Block, he's indirectly offering some elderly clients fellatio from his masseuse in order to smooth over a transaction. The character is very stereotypical after that; a kingpin who never lifts a finger since the entire island is on his pay roll. Gemma Arterton seems much more animated than some of her previous performances. She actually smiles at times and cries at one point. Anthony Mackie is the most passionate of the cast, but he also feels the most one-dimensional. An FBI agent who bends the rules and yells obscenities doesn't exactly add a whole lot of depth. The biggest issue is when any of these actors get together in one scene, you don't feel anything. There's no excitement or connection. Everything feels so flat and thrown together.The crocodiles in the film are only featured in two scenes, but they're two of the best scenes in the film. They even bring out the best in Affleck's performance, so naturally they tend to somehow outshine everyone in the cast. The dialogue gets noticeably immature at times with the word ""hoss"" being thrown around infrequently and women being called magical unicorns. Certain things don't really add up either. Richie bets his life savings and loses it all at the start of the film. If he did that, then how in the world did he get to Costa Rica? After being confronted by Agent Shavers (Mackie), Richie discusses the abduction with Ivan who seems to know all about Shavers' antics. So why would a forced picture with the FBI agent be any sort of leverage later on in the film?""Runner Runner"" may feature a recognizable cast, but it doesn't do the film any good. There's no on-screen chemistry, no performance provokes any sort of emotional investment into any of the characters, and you can literally see where the film is going as soon as Richie Furst heads to Costa Rica. Absolutely lackluster during its best moments, ""Runner Runner"" is a lifeless dramatic crime thriller that is never able to wake up from hibernation.",2,Fear the conscience of a magical unicorn,1380844800,"10 4, 2013",2013,3528,"['should', 'know', 'going', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'not', 'good', 'film', 'matter', 'how', 'try', 'look', 'most', 'enjoyable', 'aspect', 'film', 'going', 'thinking', 'rated', 'PG-13', 'then', 'being', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'actually', 'rated', 'R.', 'rating', 'film', 'feels', 'completely', 'saturated', 'version', 'genre', 'likely', 'Films', 'Sting', 'Casino', 'Ocean', 'Eleven', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'tasteless', 'alcoholic', 'concoction', 'amount', 'shaking', 'stirring', 'could', 'possibly', 'add', 'sort', 'flavor', 'to.Justin', 'Timberlake', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'catch', 'break', 'when', 'acting', 'may', 'be', 'part', 'projects', 'initially', 'have', 'potential', 'nothing', 'really', 'gained', 'steam', 'other', 'performance', 'Social', 'Network', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'different', 'Timberlake', 'front', 'pack', 'never', 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'how', 'Richie', 'life', 'up', 'film', 'Most', 'blame', 'can', 'be', 'placed', 'writers', 'Timberlake', 'do', 'best', 'what', 'front', ""'re"", 'carrying', 'film', 'job', 'make', 'audience', 'interested', ""'re"", 'face', 'promotional', 'material', ""'re"", 'one', 'doing', 'press', 'junket', 'film', 'success', 'will', 'likely', 'hinder', 'performance', 'Timberlake', 'seem', 'have', 'natural', 'charisma', 'too', 'lackadaisical', 'fully', 'capitalize', 'most', 'films', 'star', 'suffer', 'it.The', 'film', 'mostly', 'never', 'ending', 'string', 'F-words', 'thanks', 'Ben', 'Affleck', 'When', 'first', 'see', 'Ivan', 'Block', 'indirectly', 'offering', 'elderly', 'clients', 'fellatio', 'masseuse', 'order', 'smooth', 'over', 'transaction', 'character', 'very', 'stereotypical', 'kingpin', 'who', 'never', 'finger', 'entire', 'island', 'pay', 'roll', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'much', 'more', 'animated', 'previous', 'performances', 'actually', 'times', 'cries', 'one', 'point', 'Anthony', 'Mackie', 'most', 'passionate', 'cast', 'also', 'most', 'one-dimensional', 'FBI', 'agent', 'who', 'rules', 'yells', 'obscenities', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'add', 'whole', 'lot', 'depth', 'biggest', 'issue', 'when', 'actors', 'get', 'together', 'one', 'scene', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'anything', 'excitement', 'connection', 'Everything', 'feels', 'so', 'flat', 'thrown', 'together.The', 'crocodiles', 'film', 'are', 'only', 'featured', 'two', 'scenes', ""'re"", 'two', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'even', 'bring', 'out', 'best', 'Affleck', 'performance', 'so', 'naturally', 'tend', 'somehow', 'outshine', 'everyone', 'cast', 'dialogue', 'noticeably', 'immature', 'times', 'word', 'hoss', 'being', 'thrown', 'infrequently', 'women', 'being', 'called', 'magical', 'unicorns', 'Certain', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'add', 'up', 'Richie', 'life', 'savings', 'start', 'film', 'did', 'then', 'how', 'world', 'did', 'get', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'being', 'confronted', 'Agent', 'Shavers', 'Mackie', 'Richie', 'abduction', 'Ivan', 'who', 'know', 'Shavers', 'antics', 'So', 'why', 'would', 'forced', 'picture', 'FBI', 'agent', 'be', 'sort', 'leverage', 'later', 'film', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'may', 'feature', 'recognizable', 'cast', ""n't"", 'do', 'film', 'good', 'on-screen', 'chemistry', 'performance', 'sort', 'emotional', 'investment', 'characters', 'can', 'literally', 'see', 'where', 'film', 'going', 'as', 'soon', 'Richie', 'Furst', 'heads', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'Absolutely', 'lackluster', 'best', 'moments', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'lifeless', 'dramatic', 'crime', 'thriller', 'never', 'able', 'wake', 'up', 'hibernation']","Runner, Runner"

1631959,A1LYQL40IB7SBL,B00BEIYPN0,FNDNreview,"[14, 16]","Justin Timberlake is the best well-rounded entertainer in the world.  Love him or hate him, he's the closest thing to this generation's version of Michael Jackson.  Odds are, you have some kind of firm opinion of his music, and regardless of that opinion he's still a massive moneymaking machine.  His fans are loyal and no doubt enthusiastic about his recent return to music, but the gap between his albums is due largely to his ambition to become a serious actor.  Even though Timberlake is no Jamie Foxx, he's still a relatively accomplished actor - starring several memorable roles, including The Social Network, Friends with Benefits, and In Time.  Obvious, some of his films are better than others, but he still appears to improve from role to role, forcing many people to wonder if his future is in movies or music.  In any event, Timberlake is back with yet another flick, starring opposite Ben Affleck, in the drama, Runner Runner.Directed by Brad Furman (The Lincoln Lawyer), Runner Runner stars Justin Timberlake as Richie Furst, a bright young Princeton student that turns to online gaming to help pay the bills for his expensive tuition.  In the process of attempting to win money in an online poker game, he discovers he's being cheated by one of the world's most lucrative gambling websites.  Furst makes his way to Costa Rica, where the site's owner, Ivan Block (Ben Affleck), runs the site.  Impressed with his ambition, Block hires Furst to bring in new clientele and make some serious money.  However, Furst is quickly approached by an FBI agent named Shavers (Anthony Mackie), telling him that if he continues down a dark path of working for Block, he will be banned from returning to the United States.  And, to make matters worse, Block appears to have a hidden agenda and secret plans of his own for Furst.  Gemma Arterton and John Heard also star in supporting roles.To be honest, Runner Runner is not a bad film - it's simply an outdated film that would have been far more successful if it was released in the 1990s.  This film features a plot that is so painfully repetitive that not even George Clooney, Brad Pitt, or Robert Downey Jr. could save it from a trajectory of failure.  Easily comparable to films like Paranoia, 21, and Rounders, Runner Runner's plot can't be considered as anything other than generic.  Very little about this story is fresh, and it suffers mightily from the same predictability of similar films - which is perfectly evident with the recent release of Paranoia, which was unsurprisingly ignored by moviegoers.  The plot goes something like this...  A blurry-eyed main character sees the forbidden fruit dangling from a tree branch, grabs it, and takes a bit - unaware that it's nothing more than poison.  Quickly, the character realizes he's a puppet in someone else's ""game,"" and must do their bidding until he's able to figure a way out of a dire predicament.Sadly, this is far from Justin Timberlake's best work.  He portrays a smart guy from Princeton that basically has all the necessary tools an individual needs to be successful, but instead, he is easily fooled and essentially bought off with the promise of fortune.  In a perfect world, Timberlake's character would have most likely taken his knowledge of fraud to the police, which would have given him 15 minutes of fame, followed by all sorts of potential employment opportunities.  However, his character takes a patsy's job working for a blacklisted man of stature - who basically only has days until he's busted by some sort of law enforcement division.  As they say, ""there's a sucker born every minute,"" and in this particular case, it's Timberlake's character, not to mention Justin Timberlake himself for taking such a two dimensional role.While Timberlake flounders about with a poorly constructed character, Ben Affleck easily outshines his co-star, playing the calculating villain, Ivan Block.  Affleck's character is just about as interesting as Timberlake's, but at least Affleck gives this film a bit of mystery and class.  To say Affleck is a pleasure to watch is a bit redundant at this point, but it's impossible not to appreciate his impressive run in acting - which does also include his role in Runner Runner.  His recent work in Argo and The Town has been some of the most enjoyable roles of his career, and unless you live under a rock - you've probably heard he's going to be the next Batman.  Still, Affleck is a bit of an ambitious choice for a playboy villain, but he's surprising effective in this role, which should give some doubters a great deal of hope for his potential as playboy billionaire, Bruce Wayne.  Regardless, it's absolutely no surprise that Affleck owns this film, and as well he should.  He's an acclaimed actor in a role that he's probably too miniscule for him at this point in his career.Overall, Runner Runner simply suffers from the over abuse of a tired story.  The characters could have used an overhaul to at least make them appear a bit more compelling, but in the end, there's nothing about this film that isn't offered by network television.  Justin Timberlake should have stayed in the music studio instead of taking this role, while Ben Affleck shortchanged himself by playing second fiddle to a former member of `N SYNC.  However, despite the enormous shortcomings, this lackluster thriller (which forgot to bring the thrills) manages to pass as an acceptable means of entertainment - clocking in at a mere 90 minutes.  For Timberlake or Affleck fans, this film will be acceptable, but for anyone looking for a meaningful plot or ambitious film, feel free to wait until you've exhausted your choices to watch this expendable feature.GRADE:  C-FNDNreview.com",3,"Affleck outshines Timberlake in generic flick, 'Runner Runner'",1380931200,"10 5, 2013",2013,5733,"['Justin', 'Timberlake', 'best', 'well-rounded',

Sisti ""ftt meditator""","[0, 0]","After all is said and done, once you have seen the story of someone (normally a young new star or starlet) character who has been duped or &#34;whatever&#34; into a life connected to something illegal (this particular film focuses on online gambling with Timberlake being the dupee and a heavier Affleck being the duper), you basically have seen them all. In summary this rendition of this hackneyed storyline shows no creativity on any front. For example, using alligators (or crocs) to threaten/devour the bad guys was much better done in Romancing the Stone.The storyline is as above - drab.The writing of the screenplay uses almost verbatim dialogue from earlier films following the same premise. After all, how many such stories can be going on at the same time?It seems to me that Central and South American countries probably have movie company crews who go from one of these mirrored flics to the next. I suppose that the biggest fail would be when there are more than one such company making such a tired film that individual crew members become over-booked and must miss out on working on the next film with the next set of actors doing the same thing!Whereas franchise films/stories at least try to keep the hype going for the audience between the first to the ad nauseam edition, producers, writers, directors and &#34;actors&#34;  who repeat stories such as this film blatantly does, don't even have the decency to let the youthful audience know that, as they reach into your pocket to steal away with your hard-earned cash, you will eventually see this thing again and again in the future.At least when a real actor makes a summer movie (as in a movie that makes no pretensions to originality), to make some coin the film does not make the audience try to rationalize away why they paid for a ticket in the first place.Let me put it this way, when you see a film with Ben Affleck associated with it of late, just remember that churning out pretentious work will be the norm.

At one last attempt to make enough money to pay his Princeton tuition he loses big time, and believing he's been swindled, travels to Costa Rica to confront online gambling tycoon Ivan Block (Ben Affleck). Richie is seduced by Block's promise of immense wealth, until he learns the disturbing truth about his benefactor. When the FBI (Anthony Mackie) tries to coerce Richie to help bring down Block, Richie faces his biggest gamble ever: attempting to outmaneuver the two forces closing in on him. Sidebars include some dangerous interplay with Block's accomplice cum paramour Rebecca (Gemma Arterton) and Furst, and the involvement of Furst's longtime failed gambling father (John Heard), and a host of bad guys who like to fight.The script is clumsy, ill prepared and uncomfortably delivered (understandably) by Timberlake, Affleck, Mackie, and Arterton.

What makes the film work is that the filmmakers don't skimp on making sure the details feel and sound right, and allowing Affleck to infect every scene with a smarm that warns you as it seduces you.  It's as if Affleck's character in &#34;Boiler Room&#34; has been resurrected and given a prominent upgrade this go round, and this film is all the better for it. The film is never as good when Affleck isn't on screen, so much so, you're never fully certain if JT is going to survive the entire film, and in one scene involving sea creatures, you're all but certain he won't.This film will never move past being a B-list genre movie or bro-tastic cult fave, so few are likely to see one of Affleck's best performances, and certainly his loosest.

If you threw James Bond into this film it would be a great Bond Film but that&#8217;s because you'd be watching James Bond.Timberlake puts in a solid performance but the pacing is slightly off and the romance unconvincing.

I think Justin Timberlake was miscast here, though at least it wasn't Joseph Gordon Levitt. Timberlake plays a college student and online gambler named Richie who gets swindled out of his college tuition by a gambling website and goes down to Costa Rica to confront the billionaire owner Ivan Brock. When Brock sees him as an asset, he offers him a job, but Brock is involved in all kinds of illegal activity and now Richie is caught in the middle of it, with Internal Affairs on his case.Timberlake seems miscast in the role and comes off both too meek and unbelievable in the role. Gemma Arterton contributes almost nothing to the movie as Brock's girlfriend and con-woman Rebecca. While Ben Affleck, playing a villain, ironically makes him more likable here. Its when he tries to be a nice guy, or even worse a ""meek"" or ""nerdy"" guy does Affleck fail epicly. But he works well as Ivan Brock and is more believable as a bad guy (probably because I think Ben Affleck's too smug and perfect to play likable roles or heroes).The plot is a little predictable, but the end was nice.

1632005,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B00BEIYPN0,mirasreviews,"[0, 0]","""Runner Runner"" is a lame attempt to make a thriller from the ignominious fate of certain online poker rooms during the poker boom of the last decade, namely the now-defunct ""Ultimate Bet"", where site owners cheated players at the tables and absconded with money from their accounts. Ritchie Furst (Justin Timberlake) is working on his master's degree at Princeton University after a short, ill-fated career on Wall Street. When the university threatens to expel him for earning his tuition by driving customers to the online casino Midnight Black, he decides to try his hand at the site's poker tables. As he spins his $17,782 up to $50,000, Ritchie suspects that one of his opponents can see his cards. Reassured by a statistician that the player in question is playing far outside of statistical norms, Ritchie takes his complaint directly to the site's mysterious owner Ivan Block (Ben Affleck) in Costa Rica. Bizarrely, Block responds by offering Ritchie a marketing job with a seven-figure salary.Ben Affleck was among those cheated at ""Ultimate Bet"", so it's fitting to see him in a movie inspired by that story. ""Runner Runner"" has interesting source material, but the script is painfully bad, and the plot does not make sense at any point. I have no idea why a university would care that one of its students is an affiliate for an online poker room. I'm not aware that any university ever did. A 20-something young man claims that a trip to Costa Rica is his ""last chance in the world."" A rogue FBI agent (Anthony Mackie) blackmails Ritchie by threatening some charges that could not possibly exist. Nor could he have any jurisdiction over Ivan Block, no matter how much money the man stole  -as we all know from the ""Ultimate Bet"" case. I don't know why Block would need to bribe the Costa Rican Gaming Commissioner (Yul Vazquez) or why anyone would care. Or why Block throws people to crocodiles. Most of the conversations seem to have no purpose.

Thus, An Officer and a Gentleman, Top Gun, Navy SEALS and Private Benjamin (okay: maybe not Private Benjamin) were bankrolled by Uncle Sam specifically to make the military look glamorous so impressionable minds might sign up. As far as my mates were concerned it had the desired effect. Since we were slap bang in the middle of Nowheresville, South Pacific, they enlisted not for the Top Gun program but as RNZAF cadets and wound up clanking around the Chatham Islands in a forty-year-old Hercules. As far as I know they&#8217;re still doing it now. As a consequence, to this day none of them can abide Val Kilmer. But no matter.Latterly this military recruitment tactic seemed to have fallen out of favour, but it might be back: Ben Affleck&#8217;s new movie Runner Runner plays so moralistically as a lecture against the evils of online gaming you have to wonder whether FBI&#8217;s Cybercrime Fraud folk didn&#8217;t have a stake &#8211; excuse the pun.Subtext: online gaming can corrupt innocent and brilliant minds all too easily.In Runner Runner, the possessor of said innocent and brilliant mind is a chap whom we note, with some irony, made his name corrupting them: Justin Timberlake. His character is Ted, or Fred, or Jack &#8211; not 20 minutes after the credits rolled I honestly can&#8217;t remember &#8211; a wily Princeton brainbox, already in penury for inciting games of chance amongst his college buddies, and about to get in a bit deeper when he starts mixing it with Mr Big on a Carribean Island.Oddly, Timberlake has transmogrified himself from jailbait sex magnet into a faintly oatmealish actor (if Affleck is Theodore Logan, Timberlake is William S. Preston all over) whose only remaining mystery is how he ever passed for a sex symbol, even to a twelve year old, in the first place.Affleck here plays the more charismatic part of dastardly e-Casino magnate Ivan Block. Still, this is a dramatic return to form for an unremarkable actor who has, of late, been doing a fine impression of having more to him than ever used to meet the eye.Unltimately, Runner Runner is simply a paint-by-numbers Overcoming the Monster yarn with a strange title. It relies for its glamour on the absurd contrivance that people who set up online gaming companies in places like Costa Rica actually go out there and live in Bachanalian Xanadus, humping scores of prostitutes and throwing hapless local thugs to crocodiles. Here&#8217;s the news, folks: the only people who make money in tax havens by actually living there do so by preparing board resolutions. No crocodiles.In this alternative universe (the same one inhabited by Tom Cruise&#8217;s The Firm, incidentally) there is therefore an exotic locale for Oatey Justin to voyage to, and armed henchmen, dopey customs officials, sharp-dressed undercover Feds and foxes by the armful to kick the meagre plot along. Gemma Arterton plays a budget Bond girl who seems to have been sprayed with Ronseal fencing stain.Duly kicked, Runner Runner certainly canters along. It is not blighted by continuity errors, dialogue howlers or the dull and awkward moments that beset the comparable but inferior Savages. It isn&#8217;t a bad night out, but it&#8217;s short a car chase or two to be a decent actioner (charging round a carpark with a handycam is no substitute), and is missing a sandwich or two from the picnic hamper if it&#8217;s trying to make a political point.Routine.Olly Buxton",2,Routine routine,1393977600,"03 5, 2014",2014,3572,"['Eighties', 'legend', 'US', 'armed', 'forces', 'hit', 'idea', 'encouraging', 'Hollywood', 'make', 'recruitment', 'films', 'Thus', 'Officer', 'Gentleman', 'Top', 'Gun', 'Navy', 'SEALS', 'Private', 'Benjamin', 'okay', 'maybe', 'not', 'Private', 'Benjamin', 'were', 'bankrolled', 'Uncle', 'Sam', 'specifically', 'make', 'military', 'look', 'glamorous', 'so', 'impressionable', 'minds', 'might', 'sign', 'up', 'As', 'far', 'mates', 'were', 'concerned', 'had', 'desired', 'effect', 'were', 'slap', 'bang', 'middle', 'Nowheresville', 'South', 'Pacific', 'enlisted', 'not', 'Top', 'Gun', 'program', 'RNZAF', 'cadets', 'wound', 'up', 'clanking', 'Chatham', 'Islands', 'forty-year-old', 'Hercules', 'As', 'far', 'know', '8217', 're', 'still', 'doing', 'now', 'consequence', 'day', 'none', 'can', 'abide', 'Val', 'Kilmer', 'matter.Latterly', 'military', 'recruitment', 'tactic', 'seemed', 'have', 'fallen', 'favour', 'might', 'be', 'back', 'Ben', 'Affleck', '8217', 'new', 'movie', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'so', 'moralistically', 'lecture', 'evils', 'online', 'gaming', 'have', 'wonder', 'FBI', '8217', 'Cybercrime', 'Fraud', 'folk', 'didn', '8217', 't', 'have', 'stake', '8211', 'excuse', 'pun.Subtext', 'online', 'gaming', 'can', 'corrupt', 'innocent', 'brilliant', 'minds', 'too', 'easily.In', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'possessor', 'said', 'innocent', 'brilliant', 'mind', 'chap', 'whom', 'note', 'irony', 'made', 'name', 'corrupting', 'Justin', 'Timberlake', 'character', 'Ted', 'Fred', 'Jack', '8211', 'not', '20', 'minutes', 'credits', 'rolled', 'honestly', 'can', '8217', 'remember', '8211', 'wily', 'Princeton', 'brainbox', 'already', 'penury', 'inciting', 'games', 'chance', 'college', 'buddies', 'get', 'bit', 'deeper', 'when', 'mixing', 'Mr', 'Big', 'Carribean', 'Island.Oddly', 'Timberlake', 'transmogrified', 'jailbait', 'sex', 'magnet', 'faintly', 'oatmealish', 'actor', 'Affleck', 'Theodore', 'Logan', 'Timberlake', 'William', 'S.', 'Preston', 'over', 'only', 'remaining', 'mystery', 'how', 'ever', 'passed', 'sex', 'symbol', 'even', 'twelve', 'year', 'old', 'first', 'place.Affleck', 'here', 'more', 'charismatic', 'part', 'dastardly', 'e-Casino', 'magnate', 'Ivan', 'Block', 'Still', 'dramatic', 'return', 'form', 'unremarkable', 'actor', 'who', 'late', 'been', 'doing', 'fine', 'impression', 'having', 'more', 'ever', 'used', 'meet', 'eye.Unltimately', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'simply', 'paint-by-numbers', 'Overcoming', 'Monster', 'yarn', 'strange', 'title', 'glamour', 'absurd', 'contrivance', 'people', 'who', 'set', 'up', 'online', 'gaming', 'companies', 'places', 'Costa', 'Rica', 'actually', 'go', 'out', 'there', 'live', 'Bachanalian', 'Xanadus', 'humping', 'scores', 'prostitutes', 'throwing', 'hapless', 'local', 'thugs', 'crocodiles', 'Here', '8217', 's', 'news', 'folks', 'only', 'people', 'who', 'make', 'money', 'tax', 'havens', 'actually', 'living', 'there', 'do', 'so', 'preparing', 'board', 'resolutions', 'crocodiles.In', 'alternative', 'universe', 'same', 'one', 'inhabited', 'Tom', 'Cruise', '8217', 's', 'Firm', 'incidentally', 'therefore', 'exotic', 'locale', 'Oatey', 'Justin', 'voyage', 'armed', 'henchmen', 'dopey', 'customs', 'officials', 'sharp-dressed', 'undercover', 'Feds', 'foxes', 'armful', 'kick', 'meagre', 'plot', 'Gemma', 'Arterton', 'budget', 'Bond', 'girl', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'sprayed', 'Ronseal', 'fencing', 'stain.Duly', 'kicked', 'Runner', 'Runner', 'certainly', 'along', 'not', 'blighted', 'continuity', 'errors', 'dialogue', 'howlers', 'dull', 'awkward', 'moments', 'beset', 'comparable', 'inferior', 'Savages', '8217', 'bad', 'night', '8217', 's', 'short', 'car', 'chase', 'two', 'be', 'decent', 'actioner', 'charging', 'round', 'carpark', 'handycam', 'substitute', 'missing', 'sandwich', 'two', 'picnic', 'hamper', '8217', 's', 'trying', 'make', 'political', 'point.Routine.Olly', 'Buxton']","Runner, Runner"
