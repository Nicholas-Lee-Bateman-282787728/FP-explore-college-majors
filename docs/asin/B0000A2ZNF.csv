The irascible Inspector Morse has just returned from leave to discover that his sergeant, Lewis, and another Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) insist that they solved the murder of five people, the alleged murderer confessed to all the murders and was tried and convicted, he was killed while in prison; however, while dying, he claimed that he only killed four of the people, not a woman whose body was never found. Morse insists that the other DCI and Lewis were wrong; the murderer did not kill the woman. He argues that the two overlooked evidence; they closed their minds after the other DCI forced the murderer to confess. This creates a strain between Morse and his superior officer, the other DCI, and Lewis, including a shouting match between Morse and Lewis. Morse's superior officer tells him to leave the case alone, ""it is closed,"" but true to his nature, Morse pursues it.

Thaw was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years.John Thaw, as Morse, is a primary reason as to why this series is so popular. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captures the policeman's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?This first season introduces us ably to Morse and the series with its haunting, memorable music, and fine English settings.  It is very well done and a classic which will be watched over and over again.

However, at the point of death, the inmate recanted his confession regarding the last apparent victim--- a missing young woman whose body was never found even though her handbag was retrieved.  The Parnell case had been originally investigated by Chief Inspector Johnson and Sergeant Lewis, with no involvement by Morse.  Was Parnell involved in the fifth case or merely a convenient culprit?  Morse, who had never been convinced that Parnell had murdered the missing woman, pursues his own independent (and unofficial) inquiries by questioning the man (George) who found the handbag.  As a result of Morse's indagation, George is found murdered shortly afterwards and a sordid mixture of factors emerge (pornography, adultery, and possible rape and blackmail) which may be relevant to his death and the case of the missing woman.  We are presented with several possible suspects and paths of inquiry as the two cases intersect.  This installment in the series is particularly satisfying in that the viewer is kept guessing until the end when the relevant issues are fully clarified.  One aspect of this mystery which distinguishes it from the other Morse episodes is the degree to which Morse and Lewis clash--- as Lewis expresses pent up resentment over what he regards as characteristically arrogant and unappreciative treatment by the Chief Inspector.

A murderer has disavowed his earlier confession of guilt for a murder (the fifth; he's responsible for the first four).  Morse wants to press on and reopen the investigation.  Johnson is indignant, angry and combative. The Thames Valley administration wants to keep everything swept under the rug.  Lewis is caught in between.

I love the Inspector Lewis series, and when I read the glowing reviews of the Inspector Morse series, I knew I had to check it out. Luckily, my local library carries the entire Morse series, so I promptly checked out a couple of the available DVDs.I watched ""Through the Woods"" today and was very impressed at the quality of writing, not to mention the impeccable casting. John Thaw is a consummate detective who works tirelessly to get at the truth. In this episode, a man convicted as the Lovers Lane Killer, is killed in a prison fight. Although five victims were attributed to this killer whose name is Parnell, the fifth victim, Karen Anderson's body has never been found. Morse's rival and antagonist DI Johnson believes that Karen's body is at the bottom of the lake at Blenheim, but Morse is adamant in that not only is the body not at the bottom of the lake, it is buried somewhere in Wytham Woods. Morse also believes that Parnell is not Karen's killer.Meanwhile DS Lewis (Kevin Whately) struggles between his loyalty to DCI Morse and a possible promotion if he leaves Morse and joins Johnson at regional headquarters. Lewis feels that Morse takes him for granted, feelings which are only exacerbated by Johnson's constant needling.The plot is tightly-knit, and there are plenty of red herrings scattered throughout the story. As the story progresses, one suspect after another crops up and is just as easily eliminated, leaving the viewer puzzling out the identity of the elusive killer. When the killer is finally unmasked thanks to Morse's unflagging persistence, it comes as quite a surprise, making this a truly riveting detective drama.
