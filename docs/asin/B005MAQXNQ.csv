Having read and seen other video accounts of the Gospel story many times, I thought this covered all of the important parts of the story and was very captivating to watch. The animation seemed very colorful and adequate to me; I doubt they had a $300 million budget to work with; the story was the main point, not to impress with flashy technology. I very highly recommend. If I had more money I would buy them by the boxes of 10 and distribute to everyone I know who has a child, or anyone for that matter. The makers of this film obviously care very greatly about the message of the Gospel, I dont understand why some people always feel the need to be critical and try to ruin things for others.",5,"Very well done, tells the Gospel story very interestingly",1344124800,"08 5, 2012",2012,916,"['dont', 'see', 'anything', 'wrong', 'bit', 'addition', 'story', 'make', 'interesting', 'enough', 'kids', 'would', 'watch', 'whole', 'thing', 'getting', 'bored', 'change', 'overall', 'story', 'just', 'more', 'watchable', 'Having', 'read', 'seen', 'other', 'video', 'accounts', 'Gospel', 'story', 'many', 'times', 'thought', 'covered', 'important', 'parts', 'story', 'was', 'very', 'captivating', 'watch', 'animation', 'seemed', 'very', 'colorful', 'adequate', 'doubt', 'had', '300', 'million', 'budget', 'work', 'story', 'was', 'main', 'point', 'not', 'impress', 'flashy', 'technology', 'very', 'highly', 'recommend', 'had', 'more', 'money', 'would', 'buy', 'boxes', '10', 'distribute', 'everyone', 'know', 'who', 'child', 'anyone', 'matter', 'makers', 'film', 'obviously', 'care', 'very', 'greatly', 'message', 'Gospel', 'dont', 'understand', 'why', 'people', 'always', 'feel', 'need', 'be', 'critical', 'try', 'ruin', 'things', 'others']",Jesus: He Lived Among Us

1494452,A27R9JQ4KDZEH8,B005MAQXNQ,M. Brinkley,"[18, 18]","What I liked about this Jesus DVD is that it used historical accounts from the life of Jesus that often get overlooked in other features.  It shared Christ's main teachings and it didn't hold back from telling people they better count the cost of following Jesus.  Followers of Christ can expect persecution from those whose mindset is hostile towards God and His ways.It was a great approach to set up the Gospel story by telling it through the Apostle John in his old age.  Historically John was exiled to the island prison of Patmos (because the Romans couldn't kill him) and so you can imagine that he would have had many opportunities to share with those there just as this movie featured.I was also thankful for the extended length of the movie.  Though much more could have been shared, so many other video presentations fall short of the excellence that Voice of the Marytrs put into producing this.",5,Greatly Done,1325289600,"12 31, 2011",2011,907,"['What', 'liked', 'Jesus', 'DVD', 'used', 'historical', 'accounts', 'life', 'Jesus', 'often', 'get', 'overlooked', 'other', 'features', 'shared', 'Christ', 'main', 'teachings', 'did', ""n't"", 'hold', 'back', 'telling', 'people', 'better', 'count', 'cost', 'following', 'Jesus', 'Followers', 'Christ', 'can', 'expect', 'persecution', 'mindset', 'hostile', 'towards', 'God', 'ways.It', 'was', 'great', 'approach', 'set', 'up', 'Gospel', 'story', 'telling', 'Apostle', 'John', 'old', 'age', 'Historically', 'John', 'was', 'exiled', 'island', 'prison', 'Patmos', 'Romans', 'could', ""n't"", 'kill', 'so', 'can', 'imagine', 'would', 'have', 'had', 'many', 'opportunities', 'share', 'just', 'movie', 'featured.I', 'was', 'also', 'thankful', 'extended', 'length', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'shared', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'video', 'presentations', 'fall', 'short', 'excellence', 'Voice', 'Marytrs', 'put', 'producing']",Jesus: He Lived Among Us
1494453,AE7MJ2ZKR5AKQ,B005MAQXNQ,R. A. Gomez,"[0, 1]","I wanted to buy this film, but decided to preview it before doing so.  I've seen many animated Bible Story films.  Some of them have been about Jesus.  Its nice, but at times it does slow down a bit, even for adults (kids will walk away at some point).  I was suprised at seeing the characters themselves be ""cartoons"", while the backgrounds and scenarios were more ""animated""; which I did find disappointing in this day and age of technology.  Additionally, the movement of the characters, especially when they speak, does not match well with the audio; it becomes a turn-off, at least for me.IF YOU are considering purchasing this film, I advise you to preview it first and decide for yourself.",3,Great Story ...

1494455,A3QUTLN2YLW30Z,B005MAQXNQ,Thomas Zabiega,"[1, 1]","I have been trying to find a good cartoon on the life of Jesus for a while now.  I have found ones that show parts of his life very  well, but nothing that shows the life and teachings of Jesus Christ in a comprehensive manner, yet one which kids will enjoy and be able to follow.  This is that movie.  Remarkably well done.  The animation is as good as that of any available today, the music is very well done, and the editing is good.  It in many ways is the animated version of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ without all the gore.  It begins with John, the last surviving Apostle, relaying to two Roman guards why he is willing to be imprisoned on the island of Patmos for the sake of his belief in Jesus Christ as God.  Then, for the next 80 minutes we see a beautiful rendition of the life of Jesus, showing all the major events, often briefly but still with good clarity.  Though even small children will enjoy this cartoon, the movie does not stray from quoting extensively from the Gospel of St. John (and other parts of the New and Old Testaments), so it is just as good (or even better) for older kids.  It has by far the best portrayal of Jesus' cleansing of the Temple that I have ever seen in a movie or cartoon. Also, the portrayal of Jesus being tempted by the devil in the desert is simply amazing--an amazing visual representation of what happened.  The Passion of Jesus is shown with great drama, not ignoring some of the most troublesome parts (Jesus sweating blood, Judas hanging himself, Jesus being scourged and nailed to the cross).  However, besides very small children (pre-school)for whom it may be too much (for my children it wasn't), it is not too graphic, but makes children understand how tragic this was and how much Jesus Christ suffered to redeem our sins.  My only criticism of the movie is that it omits the Ascension of Jesus into Heaven (something my children noticed right away), but otherwise this movie reaches near perfection in portraying the life of Christ.  Even as an adult, I enjoyed this rendition of the life of Christ more than any other movie with the exception of the now legendary Passion of the Christ.",5,Best Animated Movie on the life of Jesus available in English,1365984000,"04 15, 2013",2013,2160,"['have', 'been', 'trying', 'find', 'good', 'cartoon', 'life', 'Jesus', 'while', 'now', 'have', 'found', 'ones', 'show', 'parts', 'life', 'very', 'well', 'nothing', 'life', 'teachings', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'comprehensive', 'manner', 'one', 'kids', 'will', 'enjoy', 'be', 'able', 'follow', 'movie', 'Remarkably', 'well', 'done', 'animation', 'as', 'good', 'available', 'today', 'music', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'editing', 'good', 'many', 'ways', 'animated', 'version', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Passion', 'Christ', 'gore', 'John', 'last', 'surviving', 'Apostle', 'relaying', 'two', 'Roman', 'guards', 'why', 'willing', 'be', 'imprisoned', 'island', 'Patmos', 'sake', 'belief', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'God', 'Then', 'next', '80', 'minutes', 'see', 'beautiful', 'rendition', 'life', 'Jesus', 'showing', 'major', 'events', 'often', 'briefly', 'still', 'good', 'clarity', 'even', 'small', 'children', 'will', 'enjoy', 'cartoon', 'movie', 'not', 'stray', 'quoting', 'extensively', 'Gospel', 'St.', 'John', 'other', 'parts', 'New', 'Old', 'Testaments', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'even', 'better', 'older', 'kids', 'far', 'best', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'cleansing', 'Temple', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'cartoon', 'Also', 'portrayal', 'Jesus', 'being', 'tempted', 'devil', 'desert', 'simply', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'visual', 'representation', 'what', 'happened', 'Passion', 'Jesus', 'shown', 'great', 'drama', 'not', 'ignoring', 'most', 'troublesome', 'parts', 'Jesus', 'sweating', 'blood', 'Judas', 'hanging', 'Jesus', 'being', 'scourged', 'nailed', 'cross', 'However', 'very', 'small', 'children', 'pre-school', 'whom', 'may', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'children', 'was', ""n't"", 'not', 'too', 'graphic', 'children', 'understand', 'how', 'tragic', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'Jesus', 'Christ', 'suffered', 'redeem', 'sins', 'only', 'criticism', 'movie', 'Ascension', 'Jesus', 'Heaven', 'something', 'children', 'noticed', 'right', 'away', 'otherwise', 'movie', 'perfection', 'portraying', 'life', 'Christ', 'Even', 'adult', 'enjoyed', 'rendition', 'life', 'Christ', 'more', 'other', 'movie', 'exception', 'now', 'legendary', 'Passion', 'Christ']",Jesus: He Lived Among Us
