903055,A3UT41TWD7N0D5,B0009A5MUO,AbeStreet,"[8, 8]","Personally I'd hoped season four would be the last season.  None of the teens in this show look like teens anymore.  I'm beginning to feel like I did when I watched FAME (the television series) as a kid.  People in their mid to late 20's trying to pass themselves off as teens just doesn't work.  Setting that aside, here are some low points and high points for the season.Low points.The writers were really reaching when they tied Kyptonian symbols to hidden artworks stretching back centuries.  I didn't know if I was watching SMALLVILLE or THE DAVINCI CODE.  Then, on top of that, tying Lana to a witch that lived centuries ago, and ancient Kyptonian symbols was a real bad idea.  It is also a real good sign of script fatigue, which is a bad sign for a series.  SMALLVILLE is about one step away from having Lana waking up one morning, going to the bathroom and finding Clark taking a shower as he tells Lana she has dreamed all the events of the past season.  Also, as I continue to pick on Lana, can Lana ever date someone without a hidden agenda or power?  I don't think so.High points.Lionel Luther's transformation from convicted criminal, to a champion for the underprivileged, and finally back to evil corporate figurehead was a great storyline.  I also enjoyed watching Lex continue to morph into the villain we all know he will become.  Watching Chloe say good-bye to the Torch was a treat and a well-written scene.  Season five just won't be the same without Chloe and her high-school newspaper.  The writers brought back Clark's super powered girlfriend from season three.  She appeared in two episodes and I feel as though they are two of the best episodes of the entire series.  Lastly, I can't believe I'm admitting this, I enjoyed having Lois Lane join the cast.  I've understood why, as a nod to fans, the writers have had people from the adult SuperMan storyline traipse through Smallville and meet up with Clark Kent.  It's cute but really damages the continuity of the established SuperMan story.  Still Lois was a breath of fresh air and her relationship with Clark (aka Smallville) is really cute to watch unfold.  The writers didn't put the two in a relationship but were very successful in hinting at the developing attraction between the two characters.As for the DVD, and this is what I've said about other SMALLVILLE DVD's, it's a great buy. Plenty of extra features, widescreen transfer and priced just right. Why Smallville, a successful show currently in production, can be priced around the forty-dollar mark and other hit shows currently in production, like C.S.I., sell for almost twice what Smallville does is a mystery to me. I suspect greed is the answer.  I'm glad the producers of the Smallville DVD's have a little more respect for their fan base than other franchises.",4,A better season than I'd thought it would be.,1127174400,"09 20, 2005",2005,2811,"['Personally', ""'d"", 'hoped', 'season', 'four', 'would', 'be', 'last', 'season', 'None', 'teens', 'show', 'look', 'teens', 'anymore', ""'m"", 'beginning', 'feel', 'did', 'when', 'watched', 'FAME', 'television', 'series', 'kid', 'People', 'mid', 'late', '20', 'trying', 'pass', 'off', 'teens', 'just', ""n't"", 'work', 'Setting', 'aside', 'here', 'are', 'low', 'points', 'high', 'points', 'season.Low', 'points.The', 'writers', 'were', 'really', 'reaching', 'when', 'tied', 'Kyptonian', 'symbols', 'hidden', 'artworks', 'stretching', 'back', 'centuries', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'watching', 'SMALLVILLE', 'THE', 'DAVINCI', 'CODE', 'Then', 'top', 'tying', 'Lana', 'witch', 'lived', 'centuries', 'ago', 'ancient', 'Kyptonian', 'symbols', 'was', 'real', 'bad', 'idea', 'also', 'real', 'good', 'sign', 'script', 'fatigue', 'bad', 'sign', 'series', 'SMALLVILLE', 'one', 'step', 'away', 'having', 'Lana', 'waking', 'up', 'one', 'morning', 'going', 'bathroom', 'finding', 'Clark', 'taking', 'shower', 'Lana', 'dreamed', 'events', 'past', 'season', 'Also', 'continue', 'pick', 'Lana', 'can', 'Lana', 'ever', 'date', 'someone', 'hidden', 'agenda', 'power', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'so.High', 'points.Lionel', 'Luther', 'transformation', 'convicted', 'criminal', 'champion', 'underprivileged', 'finally', 'back', 'evil', 'corporate', 'figurehead', 'was', 'great', 'storyline', 'also', 'enjoyed', 'watching', 'Lex', 'continue', 'morph', 'villain', 'know', 'will', 'become', 'Watching', 'Chloe', 'say', 'good-bye', 'Torch', 'was', 'treat', 'well-written', 'scene', 'Season', 'five', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'same', 'Chloe', 'high-school', 'newspaper', 'writers', 'brought', 'back', 'Clark', 'super', 'powered', 'girlfriend', 'season', 'three', 'appeared', 'two', 'episodes', 'feel', 'are', 'two', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'Lastly', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', ""'m"", 'admitting', 'enjoyed', 'having', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'join', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'understood', 'why', 'nod', 'fans', 'writers', 'have', 'had', 'people', 'adult', 'SuperMan', 'storyline', 'traipse', 'Smallville', 'meet', 'up', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'cute', 'really', 'damages', 'continuity', 'established', 'SuperMan', 'story', 'Still', 'Lois', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Smallville', 'really', 'cute', 'watch', 'unfold', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'put', 'two', 'relationship', 'were', 'very', 'successful', 'hinting', 'developing', 'attraction', 'two', 'characters.As', 'DVD', 'what', ""'ve"", 'said', 'other', 'SMALLVILLE', 'DVD', 'great', 'buy', 'Plenty', 'extra', 'features', 'widescreen', 'transfer', 'priced', 'just', 'right', 'Why', 'Smallville', 'successful', 'show', 'currently', 'production', 'can', 'be', 'priced', 'forty-dollar', 'mark', 'other', 'hit', 'shows', 'currently', 'production', 'C.S.I.', 'sell', 'almost', 'twice', 'what', 'Smallville', 'mystery', 'suspect', 'greed', 'answer', ""'m"", 'glad', 'producers', 'Smallville', 'DVD', 'have', 'little', 'more', 'respect', 'fan', 'base', 'other', 'franchises']",N/A
903056,A3DGB4HN3QCGAL,B0009A5MUO,A. Burchfield,"[1, 3]","I thought that 4th season Smallville did pretty well, if that whole magic/reincarnated witches subplot had just been left out.Clark's return to Earth from wherever was interesting as was the introduction of the Lois Lane character but unfortunately that magic stuff just never made much sense. I suspect that even the shows writers didn't quite know what to do with that idea, the way Jensen Ackles' Jason Teague character went from good to evil just looked slapped together. At least Kristin Kreuk managed to hold her own with the silliness in her lines.Most of the stories were good, in #5 ""Run"" we met the Flash, in #11 & 12 ""Unsafe/ Pariah"" the return of psycho teleport Alicia (in which Chloe sees for the first time just what Clark can do),#15 ""Sacred"" had some nice moments in China (and some of Ms. Kreuk's best possessed scenes), I even liked some of #16 ""Lucy"" in which we meet Lois' sister Lucy ( you might notice that Alicia, Martha Kent and Chloe Sullivan are just about the only non L's in Clark's life- mother Lara, Lana, Lois and Lucy), the season finale #22 ""Commencement"" had a lot going for it too, even if Jor-El still can't make up his mind on being good or evil and kidnapping Clark- AGAIN.Some things were left unexplained, unless I wasn't paying attention, such as when Lex was jetting off around the world Indiana Jones style searching out what we learn are Kryptonian artifacts. He requires medical treatment for the poison that Lionel slipped him in 3rd season- how'd he get cured of that? I never quite got the hang of the stones of knowledge (or whatever they were called) just when did they get to Earth? The escape from the exploding house bit in #2 ""Gone"" that explained Chloe's survival didn't work too well, and did Chloe's father survive that episode? Lana used to need to work to earn a living, this season she didn't seem to, and what's with the nice vehicles she and Chloe drive? Margot Kidder stepped in for the late Christopher Reeve in a couple of episodes as an assisstant, instead of a nice ending the writers just slopped it off and didn't bring her back for a 3rd shot.I liked the once a season Clark flight but I hope that the producers spend some money in 5th and get more of that type of scene. I think I remember that all or most of the super strength scenes looked good. There were a lot of inside jokes about Superman, I wish the DVD set had some sort of listing to help keep track of them.I haven't tried the commentaries but the deleted scenes are the usual not worth much bit and no ""Chloe Chronicles"" this time around. The ""Being Lois Lane"" special feature was interesting, with the various actresses that have had the role. Erica Durance's part was filmed on the ""Kent"" farm- I noticed in the background that a couple of kids were getting off a school bus so the place must be an actual working farm I guess.I'm waiting for the 5th season DVD set now.",3,"As good as the first three seasons, if the magic subplot had been left out",1129766400,"10 20, 2005",2005,2907,"['thought', '4th', 'season', 'Smallville', 'did', 'pretty', 'well', 'whole', 'magic/reincarnated', 'witches', 'subplot', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'left', 'out.Clark', 'return', 'Earth', 'wherever', 'was', 'interesting', 'was', 'introduction', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'character', 'unfortunately', 'magic', 'stuff', 'just', 'never', 'made', 'much', 'sense', 'suspect', 'even', 'shows', 'writers', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'know', 'what', 'do', 'idea', 'way', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Jason', 'Teague', 'character', 'went', 'good', 'evil', 'just', 'looked', 'slapped', 'together', 'least', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'managed', 'hold', 'own', 'silliness', 'lines.Most', 'stories', 'were', 'good', '5', 'Run', 'met', 'Flash', '11', '12', 'Unsafe/', 'Pariah', 'return', 'psycho', 'teleport', 'Alicia', 'Chloe', 'first', 'time', 'just', 'what', 'Clark', 'can', 'do', '15', 'Sacred', 'had', 'nice', 'moments', 'China', 'Ms.', 'Kreuk', 'best', 'possessed', 'scenes', 'even', 'liked', '16', 'Lucy', 'meet', 'Lois', 'sister', 'Lucy', 'might', 'notice', 'Alicia', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'are', 'just', 'only', 'non', 'L', 'Clark', 'life-', 'mother', 'Lara', 'Lana', 'Lois', 'Lucy', 'season', 'finale', '22', 'Commencement', 'had', 'lot', 'going', 'too', 'even', 'Jor-El', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'up', 'mind', 'being', 'good', 'evil', 'kidnapping', 'Clark-', 'AGAIN.Some', 'things', 'were', 'left', 'unexplained', 'was', ""n't"", 'paying', 'attention', 'such', 'when', 'Lex', 'was', 'jetting', 'off', 'world', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'style', 'searching', 'out', 'what', 'learn', 'are', 'Kryptonian', 'artifacts', 'medical', 'treatment', 'poison', 'Lionel', 'slipped', '3rd', 'season-', 'how', ""'d"", 'get', 'cured', 'never', 'quite', 'got', 'hang', 'stones', 'knowledge', 'were', 'called', 'just', 'when', 'did', 'get', 'Earth', 'escape', 'exploding', 'house', 'bit', '2', 'Gone', 'explained', 'Chloe', 'survival', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'too', 'well', 'did', 'Chloe', 'father', 'survive', 'episode', 'Lana', 'used', 'need', 'work', 'earn', 'living', 'season', 'did', ""n't"", 'seem', 'what', 'nice', 'vehicles', 'Chloe', 'drive', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'stepped', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'couple', 'episodes', 'assisstant', 'instead', 'nice', 'ending', 'writers', 'just', 'slopped', 'off', 'did', ""n't"", 'bring', 'back', '3rd', 'shot.I', 'liked', 'once', 'season', 'Clark', 'flight', 'hope', 'producers', 'spend', 'money', '5th', 'get', 'more', 'type', 'scene', 'think', 'remember', 'most', 'super', 'strength', 'scenes', 'looked', 'good', 'were', 'lot', 'inside', 'jokes', 'Superman', 'wish', 'DVD', 'set', 'had', 'sort', 'listing', 'help', 'keep', 'track', 'them.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'tried', 'commentaries', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'usual', 'not', 'worth', 'much', 'bit', 'Chloe', 'Chronicles', 'time', 'around', 'Being', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'special', 'feature', 'was', 'interesting', 'various', 'actresses', 'have', 'had', 'role', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'part', 'was', 'filmed', 'Kent', 'farm-', 'noticed', 'background', 'couple', 'kids', 'were', 'getting', 'off', 'school', 'bus', 'place', 'must', 'be', 'actual', 'working', 'farm', 'guess.I', ""'m"", 'waiting', '5th', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'now']",N/A
903057,A3TMC106MIY8S5,B0009A5MUO,A. Edward Azad,"[4, 4]","Well, at a certain point you have to ask yourself, how can anybody find this show entertaining? This show used to be serious. Season 3 had its flaws, but a handful of the ep's in that season remain my favorites. They must have swapped out writers or something. How else do you explain the camera lingering on Lana Lang's revealing showers for no reason? I'll say it again: Showing skin on Smallville doesn't work! (unless it's Sarah Carter, MEOW.) At any rate, they don't show nearly enough skin to justify sitting through this crap.*Good Points:*-Michael Rosenbaum is still the best Lex Luthor ever put on film.-Sarah Carter as Alicia Baker is back! She's Clark Kent's interim girlfriend, like a psycho Lori Lemaris (who cares if she tried to slice n' dice Lana last season and it makes no sense for Clark to be within 50 miles of her? I don't).-Lil' Flash shows up.-Lionel switches bodies with Clark, mwu ha ha.There are two new supporting characters this time, Lois and, erm...Jason. I weep for Jensen Ackles. He's way too good of an actor to be put through this horrible role. The way he takes a dumbly-inserted character like Lana's New Boyfriend and immediately makes him likable deserves him an emmy or something. Erica Durance: EASILY the worst actress, and her lines don't help. I don't really mind, because Erica looks like Lois, even if her snarky remarks reach a cheese grater-level annoyance. I think Lois would work better if she just reamined in Metropolis and we saw her only through Chloe. But I guess it's cheaper to keep her on the regular set. Personally I think it's a conspiracy to give Allison Mack less screen time. Why doesn't she get a revealing shower? Bah.****THINGS THAT MAKE MY BRAIN HURT:****1.) Clark (somehow) becomes a quarterback for the football team. You get to see it for five episodes. What drama. Ok, this is just stupid. He's CHEATING, OK?? It's CHEATING. He can't just switch off his powers when he wants to. Clark's football career also results in the episode ""Recruit"", which is hazardous to your health.2.) Turns out Lana's part-witch. I thought she was Native American? Nah, just French. And a LAME villain.3.) Lets dress Lois, Lana, and Chloe in S&M; corsets and make them shoot purplish energy balls from their fingers. Yeah, let's do that.4.) If the writers weren't going to keep Jason around for more than one season, why put him in the credits?? Durr.5.) Jane Seymour shows up in for the most pointless guest appearance in TV history. She does nothing for a few episodes then cashes her paycheck. Embarassing.6.) 'Jynx', 'Spell', 'Recruit', 'Sacred', 'Spirit' and 'Ageless'. Oh right, and 'Forever'. I hate all of them. They make me ashamed to watch the show. Some are so awful I don't think I've ever watched them more than once. That's like HALF the dvd set. GAH!Oooohh, I wonder if Clark and Lana are gonna get together this season! Just they like get together and break up EVERY season! I'm on pins and needles!The ONLY things keeping this from 1 star are the excellent first couple of episodes.",2,Hey!

Season 3 ending was a guarantee that good things were on the way and alas all we saw was a re-cycled plot along with a Charmed crossover.I found the Lois Lane character to be ill-fitting at this stage and over crowding the Clark fan club which makes it difficult for you to believe he can resist temptation by three very gorgeous looking women. Am sure the women will be alright knowing that Clark has Super powers? The Lana possession episodes were a joke,what did it all mean? Lana was expected to be more in control this season and less of a damsel in distress than object of confusion.One wonders about Jhonathan Kents' psychology , how hard is for him to understand that Clark can't be normal therefore he should not be advised to behave in that manner. I prefer the Jo-El destiny to fulfilled mambo jumbo . The Indian caves were a sad way to use Clark to teleport/communicate and they should have just stuck with the basement and the capsule.I also got the feeling that Kryptonians are not very organised leaving clues of their existence and powers all over the place and leaving room for them be discovered by any power hungry mortals.Thankfully the Lex Luthor and Chloe characters are developed in a manner to serve the story constantly keeping the audience on edge about the future. The episode with Flash and Clark loosing the girl that teleports were cleverly written. Lionel Luthor seems to be next in line to go because Lex is one smart cookie of a son(Like DOH).I hope the next season will be better and the plot re-cycling would stop because the black Kryptonite, Lois trying to be cool as well Lana possessed were running on empty.

903059,A24KWBWYYDTHC9,B0009A5MUO,"Alaine Sepulveda ""SCIgirl""","[1, 4]","...I gotta say, it's really bad. I am giving this set 3 stars for some of the character work on this show. I love John Glover and Michael Rosenbaum's work in this season, mainly because you just never know where things will go between these two. The rest of the cast do their usual things: get into trouble, whine a lot, have romantic issues, basically the same as the last three seasons. Only add into this the character of Lois Lane, who starts the season off really annoying, but ends on a much better note, a silly subplot for Lana, who by the end of the season has taken Lois' spot as the most annoying character, and lots of episodes dealing with possession, and you've got 22 episodes worth of Smallville. Unfortunatly, this season is very inconsistant in its storytelling, making it feel like the writers didn't have a clear picture of where they wanted the season to go. Only after well into the season does the show begin to finally come together, but even that felt too long and too drawn out. And the season final...well, lets just say that last seasons was much better (even though the outcome from this season was frustrating). I know it's going to set up the next season, but it felt so forced and so over done.I don't know if I am going to continue watching Smallville after this season. I'll give the next season a few episodes to improve. If nothing happens, I'm gone. My hope is that the writing improves and that the characters stop spending so much time whining and start living their lives.The DVD looks and sounds great, and the extra stuff, while not a huge amount of it, is fun and good.

In this season, Lana had an alter-ego who highlighted as a witch that happened to look EXACTLY like her, and had a boyfriend, Jason Teague, that is the son of Genevieve Teague, an archrival witch from what?  The 16th or 17th century in France?  Oh, okay. Enough said, though it deviated from the Superman mythology itself, especially with her fascination with those stones.  As a devoted Smallville fan, this season started to test my patience.When I bought this season on DVD, my mom only saw the 4th season premiere, when we all saw Clark fly.  Yes, he flew!  I had been waiting to see that since the third season!  She merely glanced at the other episodes in passing, and asked me: ""When are they going to come out with the movie?  I don't know how much longer they can keep this show up.""  If anything, I thought they would have already, with him in it.  Apparently, that ain't happening.  TOM REFUSES TO WEAR TIGHTS!There's a few positives, though: Chloe finds out about Clark's ""secret"" powers and keeps them a secret, Lex finds his dark side, and Lois joins the gang as Chloe's cousin, who keeps Clark on his toes.  Though this may be a retelling of a story, I didn't think that Lois would meet Lana, but in this season, apparently they do.

Season 4 could not live up to my expectations, though it wasn't boring either. I think there is much more potential in the story, more conflicts to be created.Let's take the case Alicia - by the way I find these episodes with her awesome. Neither Lana nor Clark's parents didn't trust her, though she was not involved in the murder. It would have a good idea to show the conflict between Clark and his parents, as well as between Lana and Clark, i.e. Clark being mad or disappointed in them, because  they did not have faith in Clark or Alicia. He rarely shows these feelings for long. But the following episodes have not picked up this likely interesting development and conflicts. Rather it was like Alicia never existed and everything went back to normal. If you ask me, way too quickly. This would add depth and intensity to the show. I somehow miss the continuity and consistency of the relationship theme.Or take Lois. Nothing ever happened between Clark and her. The relationship was too shallow and it did not lead to anything, apart from Clark and Lois being sarcastic all the time. It would have made a difference if Lois had not been there. Useless her appearance.This season focused to much on the three stones of power, the story to find them and so on, and, regrettably, too little on the relationship aspects, that made the show to one of my favorites. When I saw all the episode of season 4 I felt like nothing really happened and we are at the same point as at the end of season 3. I think the writers can do a lot better than in season 4.I would have expected more from season 4.

Fuchs, author of The Axiom-man Saga ""www...","[0, 0]","This season was like a breath of fresh air after Season Three, which was so dark and gritty and full of angst. This season also marked the entrance of one of the critical figures in the Superman mythos: Lois Lane, played by Erica Durance. She's tough as nails, Tomboy-ish and reminded me a lot of Teri Hatcher, who played the character in Lois and Clark.We also got to meet Bart Allen, on day to become the Scarlet Speedster, the Flash.The over-arcing storyline of the season involving the three stones was played out nicely and, when I first saw what they were for, was geeking out all over the place. Of course, the cliffhanger season finale didn't help anything and brought yet another long summer as I waited for the Season Five premiere to show what happened next.The only episode that bothered me--aside from the few that just seemed like filler--was the episode entitled ""Blank,"" where Clark loses his memory and the most recent person to learn his secret has to show him who he really is and what he can do. They did this in Lois and Clark and this episode almost seemed like a repeat despite the story being different.This was a great season nonetheless. Superman rocks, and looking back and seeing Season Four in the grand scheme of what had gone on before and what has gone on since makes it work really well. This season definitely was a turning point in the series, the first step in taking Clark from teen to adult.Go see it.A.P.

903068,AI46E73DWKD2B,B0009A5MUO,BackToGood,"[1, 2]","SEASON 4 of SMALLVILLE is probably the first season where more negativity from the initial hardcore fans tends to creep in. Part of it may be b/c the ""teen"" vibe of the show started to show signs of diminishing as the cast was getting noticeably older, so there was a seeming ""innocence lost"" quality. Another reason may be the introduction of a famous new character that some fans think was brought in way too early (I don't!). The SEASON FOUR premiere, Episode 1-CRUSADE, introduced the iconic character Lois Lane (played with a refreshing combination of sex appeal, bravado, and underlying sweetness by newcomer Erica Durance). In SEASON 4, Lois is 18 years old and a soon-to-be college freshman at Metropolis University. She is the cousin of Chloe Sullivan (series regular Allison Mack) and comes to the show to find out who is behind Chloe's ""death""; Chloe apparently died in a safehouse in the SEASON 3 finale COVENANT after agreeing to testify against Lionel Luthor (played with malicious glee by series regular John Glover), who spends the early part of SEASON 4 in prison. Lionel's son Lex Luthor (the brilliant Michael Rosenbaum) was working with Chloe to help bring his father down and with Lionel imprisoned, Lex gains control of all Luthor holdings.In CRUSADE, Lois first meets amnesiac Clark (stalwart star Tom Welling), but in the form of his full Kryptonian self Kal-El in a cornfield; Clark was separated from himself with Black Kryptonite in COVENANT. Lois takes him to the hospital where she meets Martha Kent (beautiful Annette O'Toole), who is tending to a comatose Jonathan Kent (esteemed John Schneider), who was injured while trying to save Clark in COVENANT. Meanwhile, Lana Lang (series regular Kristin Kreuk) has moved to Paris and is involved with a new beau Jason Teague (new series regular hearthrob Jensen Ackles). Martha finds the Black K and manages to fuse Clark back to his complete self. The end of CRUSADE has the first genuine interaction between Clark and Lois and is a wonderful scene that foreshadows their intertwined destinies in the future. Clark invites Lois to stay at the Kent farm until they can find out what happened to Chloe.The big pull of Season 4 is that SMALLVILLE dares to push itself into new territory and not stay it's traditional course. The Clark-Lex friendship begins to be sorely tested as we can see their paths diverging into enemy territory in future seasons; with Pete Ross gone, Chloe becomes closer friends with Clark and vows to stay supportive of him even with his secretive nature; and the Clark-Lana relationship is essentially null and void for virtually all of SEASON 4 (which is a bonus for me!) as Lana is completely embroiled in her own separate storyline (she's the descendant of a 16th-century witch named Isobella that is trying to resurrect herself in the present day) and with a new boyfriend. Clark is a much more interesting character WITHOUT Lana and SEASON 4 shows that!Introducing Lois is a major key as she truly brings out a new side of Clark that was unexplored in Seasons 1,2,3. While only a recurring character in SEASON 4, Erica Durance manages to make the most of her limited screen time and the chemistry with Tom Welling is immediately there. No longer brooding and whining and worrying about Lana, in SEASON 4 most of Clark's dealings actually have little to do with her and we get to see him interact with others and see the possibilities of him becoming Superman one day.Early SEASON 4 involves a lot of Clark and Lois working as a team to investigate the continuous mysterious goings on at Smallville High (I kind of think it as the teen adventures of Lois and Clark!). Lois finds out from her father General Sam Lane (guest star Michael Ironside) that she is lacking a few credits for admittance into college and he enrolls her at Smallville High. Ep 2-GONE gets the ball rolling on this infectiously fun pair as, while they're searching for Chloe (who turns out is still alive), Lois gets Clark into trouble with Ma and Pa Kent in a series of funny scenes. In Ep 3-FACADE, the dynamic duo investigate a former homely girl turned meteor freak who has gained instant beauty and popularity. Perhaps the best ep of the season is Ep 6-TRANSFERENCE, where Clark and Lionel inadvertently switch bodies and Tom Welling in particular is superb in playing the role of Lionel Luthor. Ep 12-PARIAH is a tragic one as Clark is reunited with meteor freak Alicia Baker, who has teleportation abilities and had tried to kill Lana in an earlier season and was recently released from Belle Reve mental institution; Clark and Alicia reconnect in this ep and the ending is very sad. Lois returns in Ep 13-RECRUIT, where Clark must help clear her of a murder charge of a fellow Met U student and she returns to the Kent farm after this ep. Ep 14-KRYPTO introduces us to Shelby, a dog that Clark and Lois found to be experimented on at one of Lex's plants. Ep 16-LUCY is a standout as we meet Lois' little sister Lucy Lane, who has gotten into trouble with a loan shark at her overseas boarding school and is hiding out in Smallville. The finale Ep 22-COMMENCEMENT is one of the best finales as Clark, Chloe, and Lana graduate from Smallville High (with Lois and the Kents attending), then another meteor shower hits Smallville (similar to the one when Clark arrived in his spaceship in the pilot).SEASON 4 gets a lot of flack mostly because this is the first season where many viewers feel Lana Lang became a non-descript character, which I agree with to an extent. Her witch story seems disjointed from the rest of the subplots of the season, an excuse to give Kristen Kreuk her own storyline separate from Clark and Lex. I don't completely blame Kreuk for being given such a useless storyline and being written so badly and also the rest of Season 4 is so darn good that you can almost overlook the witch stuff. Although Ep 8-SPELL, in which Lana gets possessed by Isobella and she transforms Chloe and Lois into Isobella's 16th-century sidekicks, is one of the most entertaining eps of SEASON 4! In actuality, the Lana/Chloe/Lois interactions (what little there were) felt very genuine and it's nice that these past/present/future rivals for Clark's affection could actually co-exist as friends separate from Clark. Another negative, though, is the relationship of Lana and Jason! I didn't see any chemistry between Kreuk and Ackles and as much as I don't like seeing Clark tied down by Lana, Lana and Clark made a better couple in the earlier seasons than Lana/Jason in SEASON 4!But the big key was bringing in Lois, a stroke of genius! I like how the show plays up the Clark-Lois relationship in te early years in a similar vein to the iconic one in the movies and comic books, but with their own twist. Tom Welling's Clark isn't exactly a dork or a pushover (except when it comes to Lana!), so that he actually retorts Erica Durance's Lois insults with his own and many times actually ends up topping her! They play off each other so well. In SEASON 4, they come across as a combination of feuding siblings, good friends, and exhibit great teamwork. We get a variety of emotions and interactions from them in SEASON 4 that I actually think some of the later seasons lack to an extent just because everything is so fresh and new between them in their first season together. It's like watching 2 people that on the surface don't seem to like each other, but down deep they complete each other so well!SEASON 4 of SMALLVILLE starring Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, Kristin

903069,A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ,B0009A5MUO,"Barry ""Barrybgb""","[9, 13]","While every season so far of the WB show have all been good, I find the current, and fourth, season of the hit to be the best one yet. Some agree, some wholeheartedly disagree. Season 4 is a transformation year. Maybe not as big as season 5 will be, but a transformation year nonetheless. Season 4 was an astonishingly fun and entertaining year and it is my favorite so far. Why?. The show seems to of gotten a spark, a spring in it's step, and just an overall freshness to it this year. A lot of it has to be contributed to the addition of the fabulous Eric Durance as the new Lois Lane. She is the best thing to of happened to this show. She's feisty, spunky, funny, gorgeous, sexy, and just brings a lot to the show that the series was lacking in before. The producers need to do everything they can to secure her for as long as the show runs. More on that later. Season 4 is senior year for our Smallville friends, and the show took on a more lighthearted approach this year which resulted in the show having more fun, while not losing any of it's edge or losing it's way in the Superman mythology. If anything, it only enhanced the series. The premiere, ""Crusade"", is a smashing season opener. Chloe's demise is still a mystery, and Clark tries to regain his memory. It's also special for Clark flying for the first time, and the appearance of Margot Kidder, filling in for the late Christopher Reeve. ""Gone"" finally lays to rest what happened to Chloe. It is a dynamic episode with a pretty cool villain. Clark(Tom Welling)wants to make the most of his senior year, and he joines the football squad in the 4th episode, ""Devoted"". Some think this is recycling a story from season one. It isn't. It's continuing the story and let Clark grown and do something he wanted to do a few years ago. Finally being able to enjoy his last year in high school and being somebody. More superb episodes include ""Run"", where Clark makes contact with another meteor infected kid, Bart Allen, with the ability to run fast. He will later become The Flash. ""Transference"" is the old switched bodies standby played to the fullest effect with Clark and Lionel switching. It has a lot of fun and teriffic performances by Welling and John Glover. An arc this year deals with Lana getting a strange tattoo on her back while in Paris. We find out that the tattoo is connected to an old witch, and this plays into her relationship with new beau Jason Teague(Jensen Ackles) and his mother Genevieve, played by Jane Seymour. The character of Jason is weak, and Ackles loses his welcome pretty soon during the run of the series. ""Scare"" is a solid hour of thrills as everyone's nightmares come to life after an explosion at the Luthor Plant. ""Unsafe"" and ""Pariah"" see the return of Alicia Baker. There are some flawed eps here, like ""Krypto"" and ""Facade"", but nothing too bad. The extended finale, ""Commencement"", is the biggest and best finale to date. The biggest this show has seen. I won't say any more. There are a few running story arcs for the season, and all are quite effective. Lana and the witch(which comes to bigger light in the silly, but fun, ""Spell""), Chloe finding out about Clark, and the mystery of three sacred stones that come into play in the beautifully atmospheric and fantastic episode, ""Sacred"". ""Onyx"" is a brilliant episode with Lex being split in two and becoming the good Lex and the bad. The bad showing what Lex will become in the future. It's a superb ep showcasing what kind of person our friend Lex will become. There is a lot of good stuff for season 4, and it's unfortunate for the ones blasting it. It's a fun season for the final year of high school. Like I said before, Durance as Lois was the best thing to happen. Her humor is so welcomed(and was something lacking in the series). Her inneraction with Clark is teriffic and is something else that brings a lot to the show that it didn't have before. The show brightens up whenever she appears. The season continues to expand on and explain more in the rich Superman mythology, and there are plenty of great moments of that here, and they promise more great things in future seasons. With it's fun eps, some classic episodes, a more lighthearted approach, and the great addition of Durance, season 4 of Smallville has proved to be the best season to date.",5,Smallville : Best Season To Date,1116547200,"05 20, 2005",2005,4322,"['season', 'so', 'far', 'WB', 'show', 'have', 'been', 'good', 'find', 'current', 'fourth', 'season', 'hit', 'be', 'best', 'one', 'yet', 'agree', 'wholeheartedly', 'disagree', 'Season', '4', 'transformation', 'year', 'Maybe', 'not', 'as', 'big', 'season', '5', 'will', 'be', 'transformation', 'year', 'nonetheless', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'astonishingly', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'year', 'favorite', 'so', 'far', 'Why', 'show', 'gotten', 'spark', 'spring', 'step', 'just', 'overall', 'freshness', 'year', 'lot', 'be', 'contributed', 'addition', 'fabulous', 'Eric', 'Durance', 'new', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'best', 'thing', 'happened', 'show', 'feisty', 'spunky', 'funny', 'gorgeous', 'sexy', 'just', 'brings', 'lot', 'show', 'series', 'was', 'lacking', 'before', 'producers', 'need', 'do', 'everything', 'can', 'secure', 'as', 'long', 'show', 'More', 'later', 'Season', '4', 'senior', 'year', 'Smallville', 'friends', 'show', 'took', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'approach', 'year', 'resulted', 'show', 'having', 'more', 'fun', 'not', 'losing', 'edge', 'losing', 'way', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'anything', 'only', 'enhanced', 'series', 'premiere', 'Crusade', 'smashing', 'season', 'opener', 'Chloe', 'demise', 'still', 'mystery', 'Clark', 'tries', 'regain', 'memory', 'also', 'special', 'Clark', 'flying', 'first', 'time', 'appearance', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'filling', 'late', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'Gone', 'finally', 'rest', 'what', 'happened', 'Chloe', 'dynamic', 'episode', 'pretty', 'cool', 'villain', 'Clark', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'make', 'most', 'senior', 'year', 'football', 'squad', '4th', 'episode', 'Devoted', 'think', 'recycling', 'story', 'season', 'one', ""n't"", 'continuing', 'story', 'let', 'Clark', 'grown', 'do', 'something', 'wanted', 'do', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'Finally', 'being', 'able', 'enjoy', 'last', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'being', 'somebody', 'More', 'superb', 'episodes', 'include', 'Run', 'where', 'Clark', 'contact', 'meteor', 'infected', 'kid', 'Bart', 'Allen', 'ability', 'run', 'fast', 'will', 'later', 'become', 'Flash', 'Transference', 'old', 'switched', 'bodies', 'standby', 'played', 'fullest', 'effect', 'Clark', 'Lionel', 'switching', 'lot', 'fun', 'teriffic', 'performances', 'Welling', 'John', 'Glover', 'arc', 'year', 'Lana', 'getting', 'strange', 'tattoo', 'back', 'Paris', 'find', 'out', 'tattoo', 'connected', 'old', 'witch', 'relationship', 'new', 'beau', 'Jason', 'Teague', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'mother', 'Genevieve', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'character', 'Jason', 'weak', 'Ackles', 'welcome', 'pretty', 'soon', 'run', 'series', 'Scare', 'solid', 'hour', 'thrills', 'everyone', 'nightmares', 'come', 'life', 'explosion', 'Luthor', 'Plant', 'Unsafe', 'Pariah', 'see', 'return', 'Alicia', 'Baker', 'are', 'flawed', 'eps', 'here', 'Krypto', 'Facade', 'nothing', 'too', 'bad', 'extended', 'finale', 'Commencement', 'biggest', 'best', 'finale', 'date', 'biggest', 'show', 'seen', 'wo', ""n't"", 'say', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'running', 'story', 'arcs', 'season', 'are', 'quite', 'effective', 'Lana', 'witch', 'bigger', 'light', 'silly', 'fun', 'Spell', 'Chloe', 'finding', 'out', 'Clark', 'mystery', 'three', 'sacred', 'stones', 'come', 'play', 'beautifully', 'atmospheric', 'fantastic', 'episode', 'Sacred', 'Onyx', 'brilliant', 'episode', 'Lex', 'being', 'split', 'two', 'becoming', 'good', 'Lex', 'bad', 'bad', 'showing', 'what', 'Lex', 'will', 'become', 'future', 'superb', 'ep', 'showcasing', 'what', 'kind', 'person', 'friend', 'Lex', 'will', 'become', 'lot', 'good', 'stuff', 'season', '4', 'unfortunate', 'ones', 'blasting', 'fun', 'season', 'final', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'said', 'Durance', 'Lois', 'was', 'best', 'thing', 'happen', 'humor', 'so', 'welcomed', 'was', 'something', 'lacking', 'series', 'inneraction', 'Clark', 'teriffic', 'something', 'else', 'lot', 'show', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'before', 'show', 'up', 'whenever', 'season', 'expand', 'explain', 'more', 'rich', 'Superman', 'mythology', 'are', 'plenty', 'great', 'moments', 'here', 'promise', 'more', 'great', 'things', 'future', 'seasons', 'fun', 'eps', 'classic', 'episodes', 'more', 'lighthearted', 'approach', 'great', 'addition', 'Durance', 'season', '4', 'Smallville', 'proved', 'be', 'best', 'season', 'date']",N/A

They needed to shake things up to make the show interesting again and they succeeded with this season. I'm not sure why the character Pete was written off in the 3rd season, but it was one of the much needed changes to the show. Pete had been reduced to a very boring, little-seen character, who took screen time away from much more interesting characters like Chloe. In the 4th season, they made the wise choice of bringing her more to the forefront. In past seasons, the show had gotten to be too much about Clark and Lana. In the 4th season, Clark and Lana are dating other people instead of obsessing about one another in each episode. We are also introduced to Lois Lane (Chloe's cousin). Although the appearance of this character at this point doesn't really match up with the Superman history (at least I don't think it does?), the actress they chose does a really good job and the writers have done a good job making her very appealing and different from any of the show's other characters. There are some stand-out episodes that are the best of the entire show in this season, such as the one where Lex is split into his good and bad halves, the one in which Clark and Lionel switch bodies and the hilarious prom episode. One thing that I really like about this show is that the lead females don't necessarily always need to be rescued by Clark. Lana, Chloe, Lois and even Mrs. Kent are strong women who are capable of taking care of themselves and who use their brains. This is displayed more in this season than any other. Another big reason for this show's success is the brilliant performances by the actors who play Lionel and Lex Luther.

This isn't the case with Smallville but as the creators say in the insert they took some chances and not all of them worked. But the ones that worked sure did work quite well.One of the big pulls of this season is the addition of Lois Lane which many fans feel was too early. I don't, especially since the characters are gonna be closer to the standard Superman lore that we know such as Daily Planet, Jimmy Olsen and phonebooths. Played by Erica Durance, she gives the right amount of spunk the character needs, not to mention being downright cute.The main point of this season is Lana's connection with a 17th century witch named Margaret Isobel Thoreaux(why they don't just say Countess or Margaret when they say her entire name is beyond me) and the appearance of 3 stones of power which everyone is after but they were meant for Clark and bad things will happen if everyone but Clark gets them.There are some gems in the season. The premiere where Clark finally flies, Clark and Lionel's body switch, the search for the stone in China and Lex's evil side coming out, and also the Flash and Mr. Mytz-something(I can pronounce it but not spell it). Of course like every season there's some clunkers. The looks-obsessed episode and while I'm a big animal lover and the episode is cute, it's hard to take the super dog episode seriously.Bookending the season is the super-sized finale Commencement where a 2nd meteor shower arrives and Clark finds himself in the middle of nowhere ready to start his, well, fans would know what it is. The 5th season premiere just happened and already they mentioned many things including Zod, Brainiac, the Phantom Zone, and the Fortress of Solitude. Things are getting started.The whole ""gotta get the stones"" motif of this season isn't as compelling as the mystery of the caves/key from 2 but it's still something to watch. The extras are rather disappointing though, one featurette on Lois Lane(noticeably including probably the most well-known Lois, Teri Hatcher) and a featurette on the writers. Where's the stuff about Clark's first flight, the big-ass finale? Nothing.It's a season that's like a scrawny guy getting in a fight: he might win but boy does it get it handed to him.

I remember coming across the show accidentally during its first season in 2001 and wondering why a young Clark Kent and Lex Luthor were chatting so amicably to each other. I moved on and it would another three years before the quest for television product to feed my newly acquired TiVo would lead me to giving it another chance.You see I was raised on the Christopher Reeve series of movies. His interpretation was my sole exposure to the character of Superman and ""Smallville"" seemed to turn that continuity on its head.It was however fortuitous that I re-entered the ""Smallville"" world in time to catch its fourth season (I was avidly catching up via reruns on ABC Family in the meantime). I think that by this point in the proceedings the show had settled into a routine and the characters had become well developed and fully realized.  The show was also elevated by the presence of Canadian beauty Erica Durance as the fast-talking, feisty Lois Lane who has fast become my favorite character on the show.The first three seasons of the show dealt with Clark learning about his new powers. It almost became at times like a ""power of the week"" format. So, by the time the fourth season rolled around there was just that most famous of his powers to try out and indeed Kal-El really does fly at the beginning of the season. It's a monumental moment and indeed when he launches himself into the sky and flies off I finally believed - yes, this is Superman.Making a welcome return for two episodes is the incredibly beautiful actress Sarah Carter. Reprising her role as the impish, sexy Alicia from season three, the girl who can magically materialize anywhere she wishes, she re-enters Clarks life and becomes, albeit briefly, his girlfriend. It's a fun character and Carter is simply amazing and it's only a shame that she did not become a regular.The season arc this time around deals with the search for three mystical Kryptonian crystals. Racing against each other to gather the artifacts is not only Lana, Lex and Clark but also the mysterious Genevieve, (played by Jane Seymour) and her son (and Lana's boyfriend) Jason.It appears that Lana is the descendant of a 16th century French witch who had searched for the crystals in her time and Genevieve plays an descendant of her nemesis.One of the seasons most fun episodes is ""Spell"" which sees Lana, Chloe and Lois overtaken by the spirits of three witches and this episode is accompanied by a light, breezy commentary from Kristin Kreuk, Allison Mack, Durance, and director Jeannot Szwarc (who 20 years earlier had directed ""Supergirl"").In fact Szwarc is just one of the many nods towards the Salkind-Spengler series as this season also features an appearance by Margot Kidder (who played Lois Lane to Christopher Reeve's 1978 Calrk Kent). In addition to season regulars such as Annette O'Toole (Lana in 1983s ""Superman III"") and Terence Stamp (Gen. Zod in ""Superman The Movie"" and ""Superman II) this season also features a tribute to the late Reeve in the mention of the passing of Reeve's character Dr. Virgil Swann.Overall this season remains my favorite of the show.",5,My favorite season of the hip WB television show,1167868800,"01 4, 2007",2007,3176,"['came', 'late', 'television', 'show', 'Smallville', 'remember', 'coming', 'show', 'accidentally', 'first', 'season', '2001', 'wondering', 'why', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'were', 'chatting', 'so', 'amicably', 'other', 'moved', 'would', 'three', 'years', 'quest', 'television', 'product', 'feed', 'newly', 'acquired', 'TiVo', 'would', 'lead', 'giving', 'chance.You', 'see', 'was', 'raised', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', 'series', 'movies', 'interpretation', 'was', 'sole', 'exposure', 'character', 'Superman', 'Smallville', 'seemed', 'turn', 'continuity', 'head.It', 'was', 'however', 'fortuitous', 're-entered', 'Smallville', 'world', 'time', 'catch', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'avidly', 'catching', 'up', 'reruns', 'ABC', 'Family', 'meantime', 'think', 'point', 'proceedings', 'show', 'had', 'settled', 'routine', 'characters', 'had', 'become', 'well', 'developed', 'fully', 'realized', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'elevated', 'presence', 'Canadian', 'beauty', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'fast-talking', 'feisty', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'who', 'fast', 'become', 'favorite', 'character', 'show.The', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'show', 'Clark', 'learning', 'new', 'powers', 'almost', 'became', 'times', 'power', 'week', 'format', 'So', 'time', 'fourth', 'season', 'rolled', 'was', 'just', 'most', 'famous', 'powers', 'try', 'out', 'indeed', 'Kal-El', 'really', 'fly', 'beginning', 'season', 'monumental', 'moment', 'indeed', 'when', 'sky', 'off', 'finally', 'believed', 'yes', 'Superman.Making', 'welcome', 'return', 'two', 'episodes', 'incredibly', 'beautiful', 'actress', 'Sarah', 'Carter', 'Reprising', 'role', 'impish', 'sexy', 'Alicia', 'season', 'three', 'girl', 'who', 'can', 'magically', 'materialize', 'anywhere', 're-enters', 'Clarks', 'life', 'becomes', 'briefly', 'girlfriend', 'fun', 'character', 'Carter', 'simply', 'amazing', 'only', 'shame', 'did', 'not', 'become', 'regular.The', 'season', 'time', 'deals', 'search', 'three', 'mystical', 'Kryptonian', 'crystals', 'Racing', 'other', 'gather', 'artifacts', 'not', 'only', 'Lana', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'also', 'mysterious', 'Genevieve', 'played', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'son', 'Lana', 'boyfriend', 'Jason.It', 'Lana', 'descendant', '16th', 'century', 'French', 'witch', 'who', 'had', 'searched', 'crystals', 'time', 'Genevieve', 'descendant', 'nemesis.One', 'seasons', 'most', 'fun', 'episodes', 'Spell', 'Lana', 'Chloe', 'Lois', 'overtaken', 'spirits', 'three', 'witches', 'episode', 'accompanied', 'light', 'breezy', 'commentary', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Durance', 'director', 'Jeannot', 'Szwarc', 'who', '20', 'years', 'earlier', 'had', 'directed', 'Supergirl', '.In', 'fact', 'Szwarc', 'just', 'one', 'many', 'nods', 'Salkind-Spengler', 'series', 'season', 'also', 'appearance', 'Margot', 'Kidder', 'who', 'played', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Christopher', 'Reeve', '1978', 'Calrk', 'Kent', 'addition', 'season', 'regulars', 'such', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'Lana', '1983s', 'Superman', 'III', 'Terence', 'Stamp', 'Gen.', 'Zod', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Superman', 'II', 'season', 'also', 'tribute', 'late', 'Reeve', 'mention', 'passing', 'Reeve', 'character', 'Dr.', 'Virgil', 'Swann.Overall', 'season', 'favorite', 'show']",N/A

903080,AMF7HSLX078BN,B0009A5MUO,"Dean Hacker ""dhacker615""","[9, 12]","Seasons 1-3 of 'Smallville' were pretty consistent in moving the main story forward.  There were too many sudden memory losses and the Clark-Lana relationship was teased too much and developed too little, but it was a strong show overall.  There were clunker episodes, but they were rare enough that I was never embarassed to admit watching and liking the show.Season 4 was a major step backward in all those regards.The weak episdodes outnumbered the strong ones in Season 4.  After taking the Clark-Lex relationship very near to the breaking point, the writers took a step back and tried to lighten the tone.  For the most part, this was a disaster.  Aside from 'Onyx', Lex was left re-hashing much of the same ground he covered in prior seasons.  Lana was shoved into a contrived plot involving a fortune hunting Mother-Son duo, which was badly thought out.  Lois Lane is introduced in the strong season opener, but returns for increasingly bizzare reasons as the season wears on.Chloe is given the old Pete Ross role as 'secret sharer', but the writers have the sense this time to draw out the revelation.  These moments are her best of the series with her reacting to dawning knowledge of what Clark is.  Jonathan Kent gets a big moment in the season finale, but Martha has little to do this season.  That is a waste, since both are fine actors who can play genuine warmth.  That gives them permission to show fear when Clark loses control, which is huge in a coming of age story for Superman.As for Clark himself, this is the first season that has featured no big step forward for him.  The season premiere featured him flying, but it was never paid off in later episodes.  The season finale, in particular, was set-up for Clark to jump into the air to stop the threat descending on 'Smallville'.  You could argue that it was a pay-off to themes from as far back as the Pilot.  Like Lex seeing Clark for who he is and making demands based upon their friendship in Season 3, the writers buried the Clark Flies moment under a mound of mumbo-jumbo to avoid moving the series forward.It is a real shame.  Even in an otherwise weak season, 'Smallville' does some of the best Superman stories ever.  The Alicia-Clark relationship had some sizzle to it that showed another dimension to our hero.  The Clark-Lois scenes became really good in the later episodes, despite the stupid reasons that always put Lois in Smallville.  Jensen Ackles made a good, if under-motivated villan.  The 'Smallville' take on the Flash was interesting.  Even Mr. Mxzyplk had a memorable plot-line for the first time since Alan Moore wrote his Death of Superman story in the '80s.",3,A step backwards,1124064000,"08 15, 2005",2005,2657,"['Seasons', '1-3', ""'Smallville"", 'were', 'pretty', 'consistent', 'moving', 'main', 'story', 'forward', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'sudden', 'memory', 'losses', 'Clark-Lana', 'relationship', 'was', 'teased', 'too', 'much', 'developed', 'too', 'little', 'was', 'strong', 'show', 'overall', 'were', 'clunker', 'episodes', 'were', 'rare', 'enough', 'was', 'never', 'embarassed', 'admit', 'watching', 'liking', 'show.Season', '4', 'was', 'major', 'step', 'backward', 'regards.The', 'weak', 'episdodes', 'outnumbered', 'strong', 'ones', 'Season', '4', 'taking', 'Clark-Lex', 'relationship', 'very', 'breaking', 'point', 'writers', 'took', 'step', 'back', 'tried', 'lighten', 'tone', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'disaster', 'Aside', ""'Onyx"", 'Lex', 'was', 'left', 're-hashing', 'much', 'same', 'ground', 'covered', 'prior', 'seasons', 'Lana', 'was', 'shoved', 'contrived', 'plot', 'involving', 'fortune', 'hunting', 'Mother-Son', 'duo', 'was', 'badly', 'thought', 'out', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'introduced', 'strong', 'season', 'opener', 'returns', 'increasingly', 'bizzare', 'reasons', 'season', 'wears', 'on.Chloe', 'given', 'old', 'Pete', 'Ross', 'role', ""'secret"", 'sharer', 'writers', 'have', 'sense', 'time', 'draw', 'out', 'revelation', 'moments', 'are', 'best', 'series', 'reacting', 'dawning', 'knowledge', 'what', 'Clark', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'big', 'moment', 'season', 'finale', 'Martha', 'little', 'do', 'season', 'waste', 'are', 'fine', 'actors', 'who', 'can', 'play', 'genuine', 'warmth', 'permission', 'show', 'fear', 'when', 'Clark', 'control', 'huge', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'Superman.As', 'Clark', 'first', 'season', 'featured', 'big', 'step', 'forward', 'season', 'premiere', 'featured', 'flying', 'was', 'never', 'paid', 'off', 'later', 'episodes', 'season', 'finale', 'particular', 'was', 'set-up', 'Clark', 'jump', 'air', 'stop', 'threat', 'descending', ""'Smallville"", 'could', 'argue', 'was', 'pay-off', 'themes', 'far', 'back', 'Pilot', 'Lex', 'seeing', 'Clark', 'who', 'making', 'demands', 'based', 'friendship', 'Season', '3', 'writers', 'buried', 'Clark', 'Flies', 'moment', 'mound', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'avoid', 'moving', 'series', 'forward.It', 'real', 'shame', 'Even', 'otherwise', 'weak', 'season', 'best', 'Superman', 'stories', 'ever', 'Alicia-Clark', 'relationship', 'had', 'sizzle', 'showed', 'dimension', 'hero', 'Clark-Lois', 'scenes', 'became', 'really', 'good', 'later', 'episodes', 'stupid', 'reasons', 'always', 'put', 'Lois', 'Smallville', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'made', 'good', 'under-motivated', 'villan', ""'Smallville"", 'take', 'Flash', 'was', 'interesting', 'Even', 'Mr.', 'Mxzyplk', 'had', 'memorable', 'plot-line', 'first', 'time', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'wrote', 'Death', 'Superman', 'story', ""'80s""]",N/A

I bought and viewed all 3 seasons before I bought the fourth season, and let me tell you that the 4th, like other viewers say, is more adultish and dark which I can stand more than the previous seasons with all the mushy drama between Lana & Clark, and feeling like I'm watching a teenie bopper series...The episodes have more depth and continuity to them that really keep you on the edge of your seat... The acting is very superb, especially between Clark and Lionel in ""transferance"", where each had to switch and act opposite roles of their characters... Some viewers say there is an episode with witches and is like an episode of charmed, the storyline fits in perfectly and it does not get side tracked into a different situation all together, it stays within the storyline to Smallville, which by the way was another episode I really enjoyed...The only reason why I give the show a 4 star rating is because at the end of the episodes, Clark knocks out his foes and you don't see what happens to the bad guys... Do they die, get thrown in jail, escape? Seems likes it just slides right into a happy ending, I.E. ""Scare"",(another favorite episode), when Luthor Corp can't control a virus and they finally find a cure, cut's from there and does not further the suspense by getting it to the patience on time and just goes to happy ending mode where Clark gets back home with his family and are all relieved that it all turned out all right...The boxset is excellent, the person below me says they never received the Bonus DVD of the ""Flash"" from an older season... Mine was included in my box set in another card board slip...Another reviewer said there is a part missing in ""commencement"", I havent checked mine, but if it was the parts he said it was, Im not too worried about it, maybe they messed up a couple box sets and that is why people are missing what they say they are missing??I would have liked to given this season a 5 star rating, but with the example I mentioned above and a couple ""2"" episodes being lame it had to get a 4...

My only guess as to the reason why they did this was to ""show the growth and maturity of the show"".  If that was the case, they were failing miserably--something I think they realized toward the end of the season.  It was very similar to what happened to Dawson's Creek in it's 3rd season:  it also had to bounce back from a degrading sexed up period.Another problem I had with this season was this:  Why the hell do we need Lois Lane so soon?  This show is about young Clark Kent before he moves to Metropolis to work at the Daily Planet (eventually meeting Lois Lane).  Sorry, but I'm confused here.  When Clark goes to Metropolis, he's wearing the dark framed glasses and portrays himself as a meek contrast to his SUPERMAN alter ego.  So, why then, does Lois get to see that Clark clearly is built like a rock (she sees him naked and/or shirtless through out the 4 season) AND without his glasses.  Granted there has always been that known joke about how horrible a disquise the glasses were for Clark Kent (yeah, like they really hide his features as being just like Superman), but understanding that we are supposed to suspend our disbelief to accept his glasses as being his disguise, WHY IS LOIS SEEING HIM PRE-GLASSES?!?  I mean, isn't she going to see him in Metropolis, years later, as SUPERMAN and go, hey, he kinda looks like that farm boy, Clark Kent?  I mean, c'mon!  Suspension of disbelief only goes so far!As far as Lex Luthor, his excuse could always be going a bit crazy the future---causing him to forget everything about knowing Clark Kent without the glasses and all of the strange coincidences surrounding him, but are we supposed to accept something like Lois getting a bump on the head and forgetting ever going to Smallville in the first place?

The stellar introduction of the iconic Lois Lane to Smallville. WB and DC restricted the use of her character on this show until the release of ""Superman Returns."" This proved to be a huge mistake on the part of executives as the theatrical film proved to be a let down due to Lois being written completely out of character, Kate Bosworth's substandard portrayal and the lack of chemistry between she and Brandon Routh.

Sadly enough, I have to agree with the reviewer who called this season a ""trainwreck"". After the brilliant season 3 I was honestly expecting something better. Season 4 was unfortunately marred by extremely bad continuity, lazy character development, and one of the most illogical, badly executed storyarcs I have ever seen on tv. The ratings for Smallville plummetted this season, and little wonder. The majority of the episodes this season were badly written and full of cheap sex gimmicks. The continuity was especially bad. There is an entire arc devoted to Clark's girlfriend Alicia, then she dies in a horrible, brutal fashion and her name is never mentioned on the show again. In the next episode Clark is all happy about getting to play football and doesn't seem to remember that his girlfriend was brutally murdered just an episode ago. Lana Lang gets possessed by a witch who is obsessed with getting the ""stones of knowledge"", and the viewers are made to suffer through this dull storyline that never goes anywhere and has no point whatsoever, except in getting the girl's to dress up in slutty clothing. Clark is no nearer to being Superman now than he was at the beginning of the series. The Luthors, who are always entertaining, are practically absent the entire season. Characters act in ways that make no sense whatsoever. Lionel Luthor reforms and becomes good, but then near the end of the season he goes back to being evil again and no explanation is ever given for this. Lex Luthor is absent almost the entire season only to conveniantly become evil in the last few episodes in a very contrived, unrealistic manner.Things keep popping up with no rhyme or reason to them. It's as if the writers kept randomly throwing in storylines and plots, without caring if they meshed with the episodes that have went before. Chloe finding out Clark's secret was promising but unfortunately the writers have dragged it out to the point where I am now sick of it.There were a few bright spots this season. Lois Lane was a rather entertaining character and added some nice comic relief to the show. The episode Transference, where Clark and Lionel Luthor trade bodies, was probably one of the best Smallville episodes ever made. And the last episode of the season, Commencement, is fun and entertaining and has excellent special effects that wouldn't look out of place on a movie screen.But besides these few things this season has very little to recommend it.",1,Weakest season yet,1119484800,"06 23, 2005",2005,2577,"['have', 'been', 'devoted', 'fan', 'Smallville', 'quite', 'time', 'now', 'season', '4', 'was', 'dreaded', 'shark', 'jump', 'Sadly', 'enough', 'have', 'agree', 'reviewer', 'who', 'called', 'season', 'trainwreck', 'brilliant', 'season', '3', 'was', 'honestly', 'expecting', 'something', 'better', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'unfortunately', 'marred', 'extremely', 'bad', 'continuity', 'lazy', 'character', 'development', 'one', 'most', 'illogical', 'badly', 'executed', 'storyarcs', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'tv', 'ratings', 'Smallville', 'plummetted', 'season', 'little', 'wonder', 'majority', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'badly', 'written', 'full', 'cheap', 'sex', 'gimmicks', 'continuity', 'was', 'especially', 'bad', 'entire', 'arc', 'devoted', 'Clark', 'girlfriend', 'Alicia', 'then', 'horrible', 'brutal', 'fashion', 'name', 'never', 'mentioned', 'show', 'again', 'next', 'episode', 'Clark', 'happy', 'getting', 'play', 'football', ""n't"", 'seem', 'remember', 'girlfriend', 'was', 'brutally', 'murdered', 'just', 'episode', 'ago', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'possessed', 'witch', 'who', 'obsessed', 'getting', 'stones', 'knowledge', 'viewers', 'are', 'made', 'suffer', 'dull', 'storyline', 'never', 'anywhere', 'point', 'whatsoever', 'getting', 'girl', 'dress', 'up', 'slutty', 'clothing', 'Clark', 'nearer', 'being', 'Superman', 'now', 'was', 'beginning', 'series', 'Luthors', 'who', 'are', 'always', 'entertaining', 'are', 'practically', 'absent', 'entire', 'season', 'Characters', 'act', 'ways', 'make', 'sense', 'whatsoever', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'reforms', 'becomes', 'good', 'then', 'end', 'season', 'back', 'being', 'evil', 'again', 'explanation', 'ever', 'given', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'absent', 'almost', 'entire', 'season', 'only', 'conveniantly', 'become', 'evil', 'last', 'few', 'episodes', 'very', 'contrived', 'unrealistic', 'manner.Things', 'keep', 'popping', 'up', 'rhyme', 'reason', 'writers', 'kept', 'randomly', 'throwing', 'storylines', 'plots', 'caring', 'meshed', 'episodes', 'have', 'went', 'Chloe', 'finding', 'out', 'Clark', 'secret', 'was', 'promising', 'unfortunately', 'writers', 'have', 'dragged', 'point', 'where', 'am', 'now', 'sick', 'were', 'few', 'bright', 'spots', 'season', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'rather', 'entertaining', 'character', 'added', 'nice', 'comic', 'relief', 'show', 'episode', 'Transference', 'where', 'Clark', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'trade', 'bodies', 'was', 'probably', 'one', 'best', 'Smallville', 'ever', 'made', 'last', 'episode', 'season', 'Commencement', 'fun', 'entertaining', 'excellent', 'special', 'effects', 'would', ""n't"", 'look', 'place', 'movie', 'screen.But', 'few', 'things', 'season', 'very', 'little', 'recommend']",N/A

903098,ACKDSX71VI5HY,B0009A5MUO,"Gregory N. Perkins ""wide reader""","[1, 1]","SPOILERS FOLLOWThis is a very mediocre season of ""Smallville,"" with quality control a major issue throughout the twenty-two episodes.  It is bookended by a spectacular premiere and finale, but not much good material in between makes many of the other twenty episodes uneven at best.Kicking off with ""Crusade,"" the season opens with Clark in a kind of amnesia courtesy of Jor-El.  This premise sets up several humorous possibilities as Clark happens to be the one to welcome Lois Lane to Smallville in the premiere.  The iconic ""Superman"" love interest appears on the show for the first time this season, played very winningly by Erica Durance.  Ms. Durance is the best actress to play Lois Lane, and the chemistry between she and Tom Welling is immediately apparent.Unfortunately, though, her appearance underlines the fading value of Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang.  The showrunners attempt to wedge Lana and people connected with her storyline into several very bad episodes this season.  The absolute worst of these is ""Spell,"" in which Lana is possessed by the spirit of an ancient witch that has a vague connection to her new boyfriend for the season, played blandly by Jensen Ackles.I could never warm up to the vastly overrated ""Transference,"" in which Lionel and Clark switch bodies and minds.  It's a premise that's done on every single science fiction show, and I don't see that ""Smallville"" brings anything new to the table with the concept. Additionally, ""Run"" is fun and can be good in spots, but overall is not the masterpiece it is often hailed as being.However, the season wraps up with one of the best episodes in the show's run.  ""Commencement"" is a wonderful episode capping four years of Smallville high school life and pointing Clark toward his superhero destiny.Overall, an uneven season starts well and ends well and the remaining episodes leave me just enough room to recommend it.",3,"The worst season of ""Smallville"" to date ironically features the show's best season finale",1270684800,"04 8, 2010",2010,1900,"['SPOILERS', 'FOLLOWThis', 'very', 'mediocre', 'season', 'Smallville', 'quality', 'control', 'major', 'issue', 'twenty-two', 'episodes', 'bookended', 'spectacular', 'premiere', 'finale', 'not', 'much', 'good', 'material', 'many', 'other', 'twenty', 'episodes', 'uneven', 'best.Kicking', 'off', 'Crusade', 'season', 'Clark', 'kind', 'amnesia', 'courtesy', 'Jor-El', 'premise', 'up', 'several', 'humorous', 'possibilities', 'Clark', 'be', 'one', 'welcome', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Smallville', 'premiere', 'iconic', 'Superman', 'love', 'interest', 'show', 'first', 'time', 'season', 'played', 'very', 'winningly', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Ms.', 'Durance', 'best', 'actress', 'play', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'chemistry', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'immediately', 'apparent.Unfortunately', 'though', 'appearance', 'fading', 'value', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'showrunners', 'attempt', 'wedge', 'Lana', 'people', 'connected', 'storyline', 'several', 'very', 'bad', 'episodes', 'season', 'absolute', 'worst', 'Spell', 'Lana', 'possessed', 'spirit', 'ancient', 'witch', 'vague', 'connection', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'season', 'played', 'blandly', 'Jensen', 'Ackles.I', 'could', 'never', 'warm', 'up', 'vastly', 'overrated', 'Transference', 'Lionel', 'Clark', 'switch', 'bodies', 'minds', 'premise', 'done', 'single', 'science', 'fiction', 'show', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'Smallville', 'anything', 'new', 'table', 'concept', 'Additionally', 'Run', 'fun', 'can', 'be', 'good', 'spots', 'overall', 'not', 'masterpiece', 'often', 'hailed', 'being.However', 'season', 'up', 'one', 'best', 'episodes', 'show', 'run', 'Commencement', 'wonderful', 'episode', 'capping', 'four', 'years', 'Smallville', 'high', 'school', 'life', 'pointing', 'Clark', 'superhero', 'destiny.Overall', 'uneven', 'season', 'well', 'well', 'remaining', 'episodes', 'leave', 'just', 'enough', 'room', 'recommend']",N/A

Many of the changes  to the revamped origin of Superman were an enhancment  to the Superman mythos like the kryptonite meteors playing a significant role , new characters, Lex Luthor's increased involvement,  and especially the relationship between Clarke and Lana Lang.I don't mind if the producers and writers change things in the established history of a character if it actually improves the characters and the stories, especially an iconic 65 + year history. For 3 seasons it has worked. I would even let the fact that the show never adressed the issue of where in America  Smallville is located. It's supposed to be in Kansas but it seems like Metropolis is only a few hours drive away if you know what I mean.The producers however crossed the line when they brought Lois Lane in.

903103,A2CEX7784M8YSU,B0009A5MUO,Jeffery Bauman,"[4, 6]","Show: Football. The Prom. Lois Lane. Lana As A Witch. Doomsday. Thats basically season four in a nutshell. The fun and adventure continue in season four of ""Smallville."" The main story arc of the season is a quest to find three stones and unite them. The quest to find these three stones involves Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum,) Lionel Luthor (John Glover,) new cast member and Lana's new boyfriend Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles,) Geniveve Teague (Jane Seymour,) and Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk.) However, the person who is destined to unite the stones and save humanity is Clark Kent (Tom Welling.) We also meet Lois Lane (Erica Durance,) and Chloe (Allison Mack) uncovers what could be the story of the century. Season 4 is ultimately a fun season, while not as good as seasons two and three and only slightly better than season one, is still immensly fun to watch. The only weak spot is the character Jason Teague as a whole (I just never liked him.) Many people hated the whole ""Lana as a witch"" storyline. I actually found this to be quite fun, and Kristin Kruek is majorly sexy as a 17th century witch. The cast members who give the best performances in the fourth season are Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum, John Glover, Allison Mack, and Erica Durance. I must say that Lois Lane is a welcome addition to the show, and Tom Welling and Erica Durance have a very appealing chemistry (even though Lois and Clark can't stand each other.) Memorable season four episodes include: ""Crusade,"" ""Transference,"" ""Spell,"" ""Unsafe,"" ""Pariah,""""Sacred,"" ""Onyx,"" ""Spirit,"" ""Blank,"" ""Ageless,"" and the awesome season finale ""Commencement."" (5/5)Video: The fourth season of ""Smallville"" sports a fantastic 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer. As with the first three seasons, the results are smashing. (5/5)Audio: The Dolby 2.0 Surround track is excellent. The sound field is completely immsersive. (4/5)Extras: ""Crusade"" features a commentary by the producers, Annette O'Toole, and Erica Durance. ""Transference"" features a commentary by John Glover and the producers. ""Spell"" features a commentary by Kristin Kreuk, Allison Mack, Erica Durance, and the director of the episode. Again, these are fun and interesting commentaries. The ""Spell"" commentary is absolutely hilarious.Other extras include deleted scenes, and the featurettes ""Inside The Writers Room"" and ""Being Lois Lane."" The featurettes are entertaining and it is interesting to hear what the other women  who have played Lois Lane have to say.(4/5)Overall: The fourth season of ""Smallville"" comes to DVD is another great box set. Do  not hesitate to pick up this set. The fun and adventure continue in ""Smallville!""

She is NOT boring..she adds some banter and life to the show!the lana/clark thing was getting tiresome..LANA is boring to me. i love chloe..but not with clark...i would like to see their characters happy with other guys..I am a lex/lana shipper actually.-Lois is witty and fun.its nice to see one of the main girls on the show NOT in love with clark.(well not YET anyways)I am a superman movie/tv show fan..i have seen all the tv shows (dean cain one and all) but i havent read the comics. so if you are a die-hard comic fan you may be mad at the show for some things. they did change some stuff to make it so you dont know whats going to happen and when but if you are like me i think you will like this series. and this season is great. erica durance rocks as lois-she had a lot of pressure on her but she is the best lois to me. Smallvilles different because unlike the other lois/clark shows/movies you can see them when they're younger so their bantering is more immature.(like teens)and its nice we get to see lois as a teen and how she becomes a reporter AT the daily planet too(well that doesnt happen this season but i have a feeling it will LATER ON) My fav. episodes in this season are Onyx(michael rosenbaum (lex) was awesome in that episode..i liked it when he hit on lana).., Facade(the ending with the avril song and chloe looks at lois/clark and sees something only her and the rest of us see is perfect)Krypto( just because i am a dog lover haha) Spirit (when martha gets possessed by the girl she is sooo funny and lois says that there will sooner be a man on mars than her going to prom with clark..and when she said that clark looked kinda offended..)and Recruit(tells us why clark didnt go the football route..and i like it when he got realllly upset when that guy took lois.)  anyways bottom line is if you STOPPED watching smallville like me--this is the season you may want to start again b/c this one shows the show is about to get better!!",5,GREAT AND FUNNY SEASON..LOIS IS EXCELLENT,1148083200,"05 20, 2006",2006,2309,"['LOVED', 'THIS', 'SEASON', 'was', 'PERFECT', 'TIME', 'add', 'lois', 'i', 'stopped', 'watching', 'smallville', 'middle', 'season', '2', 'got', 'back', 'end', 'season', '3', 'smalleville', 'always', 'fantastic', 'jaw-dropping', 'finales', 'i', 'love', 'chloe', 'so', 'i', 'had', 'watch', 's4', 'see', 'was', 'really', 'dead', 'not', 'then', 'season', 'premiere', 'i', 'see', 'lois', 'town..', 'NOT', 'boring..she', 'banter', 'life', 'show', 'lana/clark', 'thing', 'was', 'getting', 'tiresome..LANA', 'boring', 'i', 'love', 'chloe..but', 'not', 'clark', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'characters', 'happy', 'other', 'guys..I', 'am', 'lex/lana', 'shipper', 'actually.-Lois', 'witty', 'fun.its', 'nice', 'see', 'one', 'main', 'girls', 'show', 'NOT', 'love', 'clark', 'well', 'not', 'YET', 'anyways', 'am', 'superman', 'movie/tv', 'show', 'fan..i', 'have', 'seen', 'tv', 'shows', 'dean', 'cain', 'one', 'i', 'havent', 'read', 'comics', 'so', 'are', 'die-hard', 'comic', 'fan', 'may', 'be', 'mad', 'show', 'things', 'did', 'change', 'stuff', 'make', 'so', 'dont', 'know', 'whats', 'going', 'happen', 'when', 'are', 'i', 'think', 'will', 'like', 'series', 'season', 'great', 'erica', 'durance', 'rocks', 'lois-she', 'had', 'lot', 'pressure', 'best', 'lois', 'Smallvilles', 'different', 'other', 'lois/clark', 'shows/movies', 'can', 'see', 'when', ""'re"", 'younger', 'so', 'bantering', 'more', 'immature', 'teens', 'nice', 'get', 'see', 'lois', 'teen', 'how', 'reporter', 'AT', 'daily', 'planet', 'too', 'well', 'doesnt', 'happen', 'season', 'i', 'have', 'feeling', 'will', 'LATER', 'ON', 'fav', 'episodes', 'season', 'are', 'Onyx', 'michael', 'rosenbaum', 'lex', 'was', 'awesome', 'episode..i', 'liked', 'when', 'hit', 'lana', '..', 'Facade', 'ending', 'avril', 'song', 'chloe', 'looks', 'lois/clark', 'something', 'only', 'rest', 'see', 'perfect', 'Krypto', 'just', 'i', 'am', 'dog', 'lover', 'haha', 'Spirit', 'when', 'martha', 'possessed', 'girl', 'sooo', 'funny', 'lois', 'will', 'sooner', 'be', 'man', 'mars', 'going', 'prom', 'clark..and', 'when', 'said', 'clark', 'looked', 'kinda', 'offended..', 'Recruit', 'tells', 'why', 'clark', 'didnt', 'go', 'football', 'route..and', 'i', 'when', 'got', 'realllly', 'upset', 'when', 'guy', 'took', 'lois', 'bottom', 'line', 'STOPPED', 'watching', 'smallville', 'season', 'may', 'want', 'start', 'again', 'b/c', 'one', 'show', 'get', 'better']",N/A
903105,A2A6NH6DPE0VXR,B0009A5MUO,"Jim ""Pimmy""","[10, 12]","I liked this season, there's a lot of solid episodes but the Premiere and Finale are no doubt the best episodes. I think those were the two best episodes of the season. In the season premiere Clark comes back from inside the cave walls but not as himself. Jor-el took over his body and is using it to collect ancient stones for the cave. While in Clark's body he meets Lois Lane (Erica Durance, who I hope becomes a full time cast member in season 5). She thinks he's just someone who lost his memory and brings him to the hospital. There he's reunited with Martha Kent who's there visiting Jonathan Kent. Jonathan is still unconcious after Clark's disapearence into the walls in season 3.Anyway while there Jor-El says  that he's not meant to live on the farm and that they aren't his parents and...flys away. Seeing Clark actually fly on the show is awesome whether he was doing the flying or not. Martha finds a way to save Clark and make him...Clark again.. Soon after that Clark is at the pronounced dead Chloe's grave where he meets Lois Lane. He uses his x-ray vision to discover that Chloe is not in her grave. So in the second episode he goes looking for her. He finds that, yes she didn't die and that Lex put her in hiding.Besides that Lana comes back to Smallville but with a new mysterious mark. She also has a new b/f named Jason that follows her back to Smallville. At first they hide their love because he becomes a new assistant football coach and will be fired if it's discovered that he's dating a student. Anyway Clark starts playing football as well and has to figure out how to play the game and be there to save people at the same time. Also how to use his powers without hurting people.A lot happens, Lana's mysterious tattoo turns her into a ancestor that looked like her. One that just happened to be a witch and burnt at the stake ""or hung, I can't remember"". When she's a witch she causes havoc in Smallville and is almost even too much for Clark to handle. In one Lionel trys to do a body switch into Lex's body and vice versa. So Lex sees what it is like in prison and feels his pain but Clark gets in the way. Lionel gets in Clark's body and learns all his secrets. Disapointenly he has no memory  of it conveniently at the end of the episode. He is no longer dieing though, Clark being in his body healed him. He then changes and has a new outllook on life.There's also a cool appearence by the Flash as a punk teenager who likes to steal. When the stealing gets him in deep trouble, Clark trys to get him to use his powers for good. It's cool to see the two race to see who's the fastest. As the season goes on it turns out that Jason was sent to spy on Lana by his mother. So she also wants the stones that Jor-El, Lex and Lionel all want. I guess she thinks Lana will some how lead her to them. In a cool episode Clark and Lana go to Japan to follow Lex and Jason ""who works for Lex for awhile after Lex gets him fired as a coach"". Lex and Jason are there looking for stones. While there Lana turns into the witch and her and Clark fight over the stone.Plus Chloe  discovers Clark's secret when she sees him using his powers. Clark doesn't know this though but surprisingly Chloe is cool with it and keeps it a secret. In another great episode Lex gets split in two. His bad side takes over his life and puts a ""Man in the Iron Mask"" type of Mask on Lex and locks him in the basement. No one knows that there's two of them, not even Clark. Bad Lex bad mouths Lionel and gives him what Lionel calls a wake up call when he becomes evil again. In one of the best episodes Clark loses his memory and we discover who he can trust and not trust. Chloe makes Clark believe that he trusted her with his secret and that she always knew. She confesses to him that she thinks he got his powers from the meteor rocks. Lex though shows he can't be trusted. He tells Clark that they worked on the cave walls together and gets Clark to tell him things he wouldn't normally tell him.In the episode before the season finale, some strange kid makes the inside of a building look exactly like Smallville High. There he captures students and makes them make believe they're having a normal school day. He never wants things to change and doesn't wanna ever leave high school. If the kids don't go by his rules he freezes them with some sort of mold. In one of the most violent and shocking scenes ever. He freezes a pretty girl and throws her head down the stairs which then breaks into a million pieces. That episode is kinda creepy.The best episode ever! I think is the season finale though. Clark's graduation is shortened when it's announced that a meteors are gonna hit Smallville. Clark talks to Jor-El and finds out that not even he can stop them. He tells Clark that he needs to find the missing stones. He tells his parents that he can't go with them in the truck and they say their byes. He doesn't know though that shortly after leaving, Jason stops their truck with a shot gun looking for Clark. He makes them go back to the farm and holds them hostage. After killing Jason's mom out of self defense Lana gets help from Lex.Lex sends Lana on a helacopter when the meteors are about to hit. The helacopter goes down and Lana crawls out of it bloody. She finds a.... space ship and I can't wait to find out who or what is inside. A new villain hopefully. Anyway a meteor hits Clark's house with his parents and Jason inside. So we also have to wait to next fall to see if they're alive. Clark puts a stone in the cave wall which sends an energy wave to the Stone in Lionel's pocket. It knocks him out cold and it looks like it some how puts krypton knowledge into him. We'll have to wait until he wakes up to find out.Anyway Clark steals the stone from Lex's vault ""who locked it there when it flew out of Lionel's pocket"". The vault had krptonite in it though and Chloe finds Clark passed out and drags him out of it. Lex just catches Chloe there and is pretty pissed at her. He drags her to the caves where Clark is there adding another stone. Chloe knocks out Lex though so he couldn't see Clark. Clark gets telaported to a snowy area and the episode ends with Clark throwing a crystal like stone.  It also ends with so many questions having to be answered and die hard fans like myself not being able to wait until season 5.",4,A cool season,1116806400,"05 23, 2005",2005,6353,"['liked', 'season',

903109,A2XAGLR8VDOU6T,B0009A5MUO,"Joshua Spaulding ""Television God""","[5, 5]","The introduction of Lois Lane, a key player in the Superman saga, marked the beginning of the fourth season of Smallville, and from there, the story of a teenage Clark Kent just got more and more interesting, leading up to the season finale that kept people guessing  until the start of the new season this past fall.Clark Kent (Tom Welling) grew up on a farm in Smallville, Kansas with his parents Jonathan (John Schneider) and Martha (Annette O'Toole). It became quickly obvious that this boy was different and Smallville tracks the life of Clark and his family and friends as he tries to navigate the corridors of high school, all the while hiding super powers from his closest friends.In the opening minutes of the season, it is three months after the season three finale, where explosions and poisonings were just part of the action. Clark has been ""away"" answering the call of his birth father Jor-El. He returns to earth, causing Lois to drive off the road into a cornfield to discover him, naked, and not knowing where he is or who he is. From there, Clark's year got even more interested. He joined the football team and kept his powers in check on the field. He got offered a full-ride to Metropolis University for football, but turned it down when he realized how hard it would be to do the same thing on the big stage. He helped Lois (Guest star Erica Durance) solve the mystery of the apparent death of her cousin Chloe (Allison Mack) and dated a girl (the achingly gorgeous Sarah Carter) who tried to kill both he and Lana a year earlier. All in all, it was an interesting season for Clark, who found himself in the Arctic as the season ended, after reuniting three ancient stones in their slots in the caves.The love of Clark's life, Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk) also had an interesting year. She began the season in Paris, studying at art school and meeting Jason (Jensen Ackles), a fellow American she began dating. When a mysterious tatoo appears on her body while researching an ancient witch, she finds herself drawn back to Smallville to find out just what has happened. The tatoo mystery grows deeper as Jason and his mother (guest star Jane Seymour) appear to be much more than just what they appear. Lana and Clark go to China in search of one of the ancient stones, and find Jason already there with the same goal in mind. As the season draws to a close, Lana kills Jason's mom with one of the stones, and seemingly causing another meteor shower to hit Smallville.Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) was poisoned as the previous season came to a close and finds himself, still recovering, in Egypt searching for one of the ancient stones that play such a prevalent role in this season. He finds one and spends much of the season looking for others, all the while competing with his father Lionel (John Glover) for these artifacts. Lionel was in jail when the season started and through a freak accident, switches bodies with Clark and learns of the youngster's secrets. The two Luthors both search for the ancient stones, but it is Clark who finally reunites them where they belong.Chloe is presumed dead when the season begins. In the final moments of season three, her safe house exploded. She was set to testify against Lionel in a trial and viewers are left to expect that Lionel killed her to get away. Clark and Lois find her, safely hidden by Lex, who wants desparately to put his father away. Chloe becomes a keeper of Clark's secret later in the season, though he doesn't find out about her knowledge until the start of season five. She is also a key player in reintroducing Clark to the world when he has yet another bout of amnesia later in the season.Martha and Jonathan Kent continue to mentor their son, teaching him to use his powers for good and raising him to the best of their abilities. One of the highlights, or at least funniest parts of the season, is when Martha's body is inhabited by a cheerleader and she dances around the house singing La La by Ashlee Simpson. As the season draws to a close, the Kents say goodbye to Clark as another meteor shower approaches and they know that they may never see their son again, but also know they have equipped him to make the right choices wherever he chooses to go.This show is one of my favorites and even in the Thursday time slot it was moved to in this season, it still flourished. I was definitely happy to see this set hit stores and am excited for the fifth season, which should be released later this year. This set had a couple of commentary tracks, a great feature about playing Lois Lane (although Teri Hatcher is profiled, she wasn't interviewed, which was kind of a disappointment), and a look into the writers' room.All told, this was another well-done set in the Smallville series. The show continues to entertain and the powers that be continue to release great sets.",5,"Clark Kent, meet Lois Lane",1140912000,"02 26, 2006",2006,4866,"['introduction', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'key', 'player', 'Superman', 'saga', 'marked', 'beginning', 'fourth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'there', 'story', 'teenage', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'just', 'got', 'more', 'more', 'interesting', 'leading', 'up', 'season', 'finale', 'kept', 'people', 'guessing', 'start', 'new', 'season', 'past', 'fall.Clark', 'Kent', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'grew', 'up', 'farm', 'Smallville', 'Kansas', 'parents', 'Jonathan', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Martha', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'became', 'quickly', 'obvious', 'boy', 'was', 'different', 'Smallville', 'life', 'Clark', 'family', 'friends', 'navigate', 'corridors', 'high', 'school', 'while', 'hiding', 'super', 'powers', 'closest', 'friends.In', 'opening', 'minutes', 'season', 'three', 'months', 'season', 'three', 'finale', 'where', 'explosions', 'poisonings', 'were', 'just', 'part', 'action', 'Clark', 'been', 'away', 'answering', 'call', 'birth', 'father', 'Jor-El', 'earth', 'causing', 'Lois', 'drive', 'off', 'road', 'cornfield', 'discover', 'naked', 'not', 'knowing', 'where', 'who', 'there', 'Clark', 'year', 'got', 'even', 'more', 'interested', 'joined', 'football', 'team', 'kept', 'powers', 'check', 'field', 'got', 'offered', 'full-ride', 'Metropolis', 'University', 'football', 'turned', 'down', 'when', 'realized', 'how', 'hard', 'would', 'be', 'do', 'same', 'thing', 'big', 'stage', 'helped', 'Lois', 'Guest', 'star', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'solve', 'mystery', 'apparent', 'death', 'cousin', 'Chloe', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'dated', 'girl', 'achingly', 'gorgeous', 'Sarah', 'Carter', 'who', 'tried', 'kill', 'Lana', 'year', 'earlier', 'was', 'interesting', 'season', 'Clark', 'who', 'found', 'Arctic', 'season', 'ended', 'reuniting', 'three', 'ancient', 'stones', 'slots', 'caves.The', 'love', 'Clark', 'life', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'also', 'had', 'interesting', 'year', 'began', 'season', 'Paris', 'studying', 'art', 'school', 'meeting', 'Jason', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'fellow', 'American', 'began', 'dating', 'When', 'mysterious', 'tatoo', 'body', 'researching', 'ancient', 'witch', 'drawn', 'back', 'Smallville', 'find', 'out', 'just', 'what', 'happened', 'tatoo', 'mystery', 'deeper', 'Jason', 'mother', 'guest', 'star', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'appear', 'be', 'much', 'more', 'just', 'what', 'appear', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'go', 'China', 'search', 'one', 'ancient', 'stones', 'find', 'Jason', 'already', 'there', 'same', 'goal', 'mind', 'season', 'close', 'Lana', 'Jason', 'mom', 'one', 'stones', 'seemingly', 'causing', 'meteor', 'shower', 'hit', 'Smallville.Lex', 'Luthor', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'was', 'poisoned', 'previous', 'season', 'came', 'close', 'still', 'recovering', 'Egypt', 'searching', 'one', 'ancient', 'stones', 'play', 'prevalent', 'role', 'season', 'one', 'much', 'season', 'looking', 'others', 'while', 'competing', 'father', 'Lionel', 'John', 'Glover', 'artifacts', 'Lionel', 'was', 'jail', 'when', 'season', 'started', 'freak', 'accident', 'bodies', 'Clark', 'learns', 'youngster', 'secrets', 'two', 'Luthors', 'search', 'ancient', 'stones', 'Clark', 'who', 'finally', 'where', 'belong.Chloe', 'presumed', 'dead', 'when', 'season', 'final', 'moments', 'season', 'three', 'safe', 'house', 'exploded', 'was', 'set', 'testify', 'Lionel', 'trial', 'viewers', 'are', 'left', 'expect', 'Lionel', 'killed', 'get', 'away', 'Clark', 'Lois', 'find', 'safely', 'hidden', 'Lex', 'who', 'desparately', 'put', 'father', 'away', 'Chloe', 'keeper', 'Clark', 'secret', 'later', 'season', ""n't"", 'find', 'out', 'knowledge', 'start', 'season', 'five', 'also', 'key', 'player', 'reintroducing', 'Clark', 'world', 'when', 'yet', 'bout', 'amnesia', 'later', 'season.Martha', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'continue', 'mentor', 'son', 'teaching', 'use', 'powers', 'good', 'raising', 'best', 'abilities', 'One', 'highlights', 'least', 'funniest', 'parts', 'season', 'when', 'Martha', 'body', 'inhabited', 'cheerleader', 'house', 'singing', 'La', 'La', 'Ashlee', 'Simpson', 'season', 'close', 'Kents', 'say', 'goodbye', 'Clark', 'meteor', 'shower', 'approaches', 'know', 'may', 'never', 'see', 'son', 'again', 'also', 'know', 'have', 'equipped', 'make', 'right', 'choices', 'wherever', 'go.This', 'show', 'one', 'favorites', 'even', 'Thursday', 'time', 'slot', 'was', 'moved', 'season', 'still', 'flourished', 'was', 'definitely', 'happy', 'see', 'set', 'hit', 'stores', 'am', 'excited', 'fifth', 'season', 'should', 'be', 'released', 'later', 'year', 'set', 'had', 'couple', 'commentary', 'tracks', 'great', 'feature', 'playing', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Teri', 'Hatcher', 'profiled', 'was', ""n't"", 'interviewed', 'was', 'kind', 'disappointment', 'look', 'writers', 'room.All', 'told', 'was', 'well-done', 'set', 'Smallville', 'series', 'show', 'entertain', 'powers', 'be', 'continue', 'release', 'great', 'sets']",N/A

Will Jonathan survive Jor-El's attack in the cave, how will Martha cope without knowing where her son has been, is Chloe dead, what exactly did Lionel put in Lex's drink to poison him and what will happen with Lionel's prison sentence and his cancer?  Well, most of these questions were answered within the first 2 episodes, the Lionel storyline actually carried through a large part of the new season.  Besides answering those burning questions, ""Smallville: Season 4"" raised many new ones that would drive the new season along.  I won't tell you what those questions are due to the fact that you should watch and find out for yourself, but I will tell you some points that are touched on in the season.In season 4 many changes are made to the show, two notable changes are the additions of two new cast members, Jensen Ackles, who plays Lana's new love interest, and Erica Durance as Lois Lane (possibly the best looking Lois ever, maybe even better than Teri Hatcher).  Clark does get a new power for one episode, now when I say it's only for one episode, it's not because the power doesn't fit into the Superman mythos, but that the way he achieved his power is resolved and the power disappears for a time, but the power will return at some point, just not in season 4.  The rift between Clark and Lex continues to spread, but some measure of peace is found between the two friends.  Clark finally plays football this season and is taught a lesson that no matter what, his destiny lies in something greater than scoring points in a game.  Also, a classic DC Comics Superman villain makes an appearance.  All of this, leading up to a terrific season 4 cliffhanger that takes place in an incredibly cold place that fans of the Superman comics will instantly recognize and know where the new season is heading.Overall, a terrific season of a series that continues to top itself every year.  The entire cast of characters really mature this season as we witness their graduation from high school into adulthood in the season finale.  Erica Durance and Jensen Ackles really bring a lot of fun and new twists to the series.

903120,A2S9P70216QC2H,B0009A5MUO,"lenzino7383 ""BigBlue""","[1, 1]","Season Review-After 3 consistently stellar seasons and probably some of the most shocking cliffhangers at the end of ""Covenant"", Season 4 of Smallville saw the series soaring to new height...literally! In the epic premiere, ""Crusade"", Clark Kent has returned as Kal-El, after being brainwashed by his father Jor-El and literally takes flight on a crusade to find 3 stones. With such a stunning sequence with Clark taking his first flight, not to mention intriguing questions lad out: What are these stones?  Why is Lex looking them? How is Chloe still alive? What with Lana getting that strange tattoo in Paris? It seems Season 4 was off to an excellent start, unfortunately, it doesn't turn out even being as good as it could have been. As you read the Season 4 overview written by creators Alfred Gough and Miles Millar they explain that Season 4 was supposed to be a lighthearted season getting the series back to being fun again after the darkness of Season 3. They continue to explain that some things worked, something didn't.  That basically sums up Season 4! It was a mixed bad of poor execution and nice ideas.  The season as whole has a pretty good story arc with the search for the 3 stones, but instead of spread out the storyline for majority of the season, the writer seemly forget about it for the most part.  Then all we're left with are a bunch of pointless fillers, most of them being some of the worst episodes of the series. ""Faade"" is a pathetic attempt at the writers capitalizing on the Nip/Tuck, ""Devoted"" sees cheerleaders mixing chemicals with kryptonite to make they're boyfriends their love slaves, ""Bound"" is a weak entry of the Lex centric episodes, ""Recruit"" is boring, ""Lucy"" is...why did we need to meet Lois Lane's sister again?, ""Forever"" is another rip-off, and ""Ageless"" is beyond awful I can't describe it! I haven't even gotten into the ridiculous witch storyline that seemed to co-exist with the stones storyline.  My problem with the witch storyline is not only is it poorly written and silly to begin with, it made it obvious at that point that Lana Lang had over stayed her welcome! Kristin Kruek just couldn't pull off the playing Isabelle, an ancestor of Lana's who happens to be a powerful witch from the 17th century (Uhmmm...yeah!) Her performance is so hammy and over-the-top it's hard to take this already forced plot seriously. The perfect example of this is the infamous ""Spell"" where Isabelle and her fellow maidens take possession of our 3 leadings ladies as they wreck havoc on Smallville. Let's just say, I've seen better episodes of Charmed compared to that episode! Then there's the bizarre development of the Teagues, or more importantly Jason Teague, Lana's new boyfriend and assistant coach. Jenson Ackles is a very good actor, but even he couldn't make sense out of the character of Jason. At the start of the season, Jason seemed like a nice supporting character with a sense of humor but than the writers do a 180 and turn him into an evil prodigal of his mother...wait...when did this happen? Also Jason's relationship with Lana just bores and just makes Lana look desperate in the end.But Season 4 is not all bad; in fact, this season features some of the series' best episodes! There's, of course, the thrilling premiere ""Crusade"", the unforgettable introduction of the Flash in the fun filled ""Run"", the classic ""Transference"" sees Tom Welling's best performance yet when Lionel Luthor is in Clark's body, we get a taste of the villain mastermind that is Lex Luthor in ""Onyx"" and ""Commencement"" could very well be the finest hour in the series' history. The longest episode to date and almost feeling like a series finale, ""Commencement"" takes the series to the next step in Clark's journey as he finds himself in the Arctic on the verge of building...well you know! You also can't talk about the fourth season without mention the introduction of Lois Lane. Being the ultimate leading lady of Superman mythos for 70 years, fans were skeptical about the introducing Lois Lane during Clark's pre-Superman days, but once Lois step on the screen, it was...well...magic! With Sam Jones III out of the way, Erica Durance's Lois Lane made for a fine addition, or do I dare say better character. From the get go, Eric plays Lois with all the witty sarcasm and feisty attitude that you would expect from the character. Also, Lois brings a freshness and fun to the series not seen since the first season. Lois and Clark's interaction throughout are one of the highlights from this season, as it's great to see them build a relationship that will become so much more in the future.Other Season 4 highlights include Lionel Luthor's fascinating storyline throughout this season as we watch him fall apart in jail after being sent there during the events of ""Covenant"". The transition that Lionel makes from a cruel tyrant to a man seeking redemption might seem like a hard task for some actors, but John Glover does it so realistically you can't help but route for the character. Allison Mack's Chloe finds out the shocking truth about Clark and makes honorable decision with that secret that truly develops the character in a stunning way. After the fallout of their friendship in ""Covenant"", Clark and Lex decide to give their friendship a second try, but it's obviously that things aren't going to be the same between them. Clark actually gets a fun storyline for a while when he decides to play football for Smallville High. Jane Seymour (Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman) stars as Jason's mother Genevieve Teague and brings a bit a class to an otherwise lackluster storyline. Ohh, I almost forgot to mention Margot Kidder (Lois Lane of the Richard Donner films) makes an appearance in the season premiere, reuniting with her Superman 3 co-star Annette `O Toole. But still despite the pros, the cons really way down on this season as the writers seemed to throw in so many ideas, that half of them turn out being bad.  Season 4 showcases the series at its worst and best, but overall, the season is mediocre at best!Season Rating: 5/10Video and Audio-All 22 Season 4 episodes look stunning in widescreen. The show continues to look better each season as well as sound better.Video and Audio Rating: 8.5/10Extras:I have to admit the features are getting more entertaining with each box set. There are selected commentaries for individual episodes, with the best one being for ""Spell"". Ironically, the hilarious comments made from Allison Mack, Erica Durance, and Kristin Kruek makes the episode even worth watching. A cool documentary of how the writing staff creates the ideas for the show.  Erica Durance and former Lois Lane portrayers (except for Teri Hatcher...darn!) reunite for very intriguing look at the importance of Lois Lane in the Superman mythology.  It's obvious these women take pride in being apart of something as huge as Superman and it's touching to see.  Deleted scenes are also plentiful once again, but vary in quality.Extras Rating: 8/10Overall Score: 7/10",4,"Stones, Football and Lois Lane!-Smallville's Complete Fourth Season",1231372800,"01 8,

903121,APGDB8X9AGCGO,B0009A5MUO,Lin Yan,"[5, 10]","This is by far the worst season comparing its predessors.Smallville has always been my favorite show due to its descent cast and a storyline will not insult your inteligence. However, this season failed to keep up the same charm with the previous seasons, with some floppy plots involving some season fillers that ruined the entire story.The forth season of Smallville started with a lightening strike brought to the outskirt of the town with the encounter of a brand new character.Lois Lane, who was determined in finding out the truth about her cousin's death, accidently encountered with Clark who lost his memory, lying naked in the filed after he was hit by lightening, thurs begins the new story of our season.However, this new character somehow failed to bring up the same charm comparing with her predessors Lois Lane...dispite she tried hard to bring the characteristic of Lois-like talkingactive, she dose seem a little anoying, and sometimes excessivly open, like sharing bathroom with someone she baraly knew.The worst has yet to come. Since our beautiful Lana decided to move up her life in France, fell in love with this clumsy character called Jason, somehow found out her true identity as a witch. Now,I have no grudge against Harry Potter, in fact I am a Potter fan myself. But having superman characters mixing up with witchcraft dose not appear to be a brillant idear, not to mention the involvment of previous life, jinx or spells, all these elements were seem way too superstitious for a superhero Si-Fi comic story, and thus the idear about Lana being witch has completely ruined this character.Lionel is the second selected charcter ruined by Season 4. Imprisoned for the crime he commited, our magnificent super villan had managed to discover the power to heal his soul, turned himself into a good guy, who decided to repent for his guilt. However, he was recuperated as a villan once again after released from prison, and later on ends up being paralized by the power of the stones. This has not been the best scenario for a character like Lionel Luthor.As for his Son, Lex finally overcame his strugle between good and evil, chose the path followed by his destiny. He is the only one character who did allright in this season. There is one episode about his personalities was spilted and briefly shape up for what would become of him as the will-be NO.1 enemy of superman.Krypto has also joined the show. As a special guest, he dose show his quality. The idear of bringing the superdog into the show is not bad, if only he gets some extra plays.Dispite the fact that the producers did try to bring up some new charm for the show, the storyline is weak and it seems like they are running out of idears. The only episode that really worths the price is the season finale, when Clark really started to face his destiny.Let's face the fact that we have seen a terrible season, and let's put our expectation to the upcoming season 5, which will be the final season of Smallville.",1,Downfall of the show,1130889600,"11 2, 2005",2005,3000,"['far', 'worst', 'season', 'comparing', 'predessors.Smallville', 'always', 'been', 'favorite', 'show', 'due', 'descent', 'cast', 'storyline', 'will', 'not', 'insult', 'inteligence', 'However', 'season', 'failed', 'keep', 'up', 'same', 'charm', 'previous', 'seasons', 'floppy', 'plots', 'involving', 'season', 'fillers', 'ruined', 'entire', 'story.The', 'forth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'started', 'lightening', 'strike', 'brought', 'outskirt', 'town', 'encounter', 'brand', 'new', 'character.Lois', 'Lane', 'who', 'was', 'determined', 'finding', 'out', 'truth', 'cousin', 'death', 'accidently', 'encountered', 'Clark', 'who', 'lost', 'memory', 'lying', 'naked', 'filed', 'was', 'hit', 'lightening', 'thurs', 'new', 'story', 'season.However', 'new', 'character', 'somehow', 'failed', 'bring', 'up', 'same', 'charm', 'comparing', 'predessors', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'tried', 'hard', 'bring', 'characteristic', 'Lois-like', 'talkingactive', 'dose', 'seem', 'little', 'anoying', 'sometimes', 'excessivly', 'open', 'sharing', 'bathroom', 'someone', 'baraly', 'knew.The', 'worst', 'yet', 'come', 'beautiful', 'Lana', 'decided', 'move', 'up', 'life', 'France', 'fell', 'love', 'clumsy', 'character', 'called', 'Jason', 'somehow', 'found', 'out', 'true', 'identity', 'witch', 'Now', 'have', 'grudge', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'fact', 'am', 'Potter', 'fan', 'having', 'superman', 'characters', 'mixing', 'up', 'witchcraft', 'dose', 'not', 'appear', 'be', 'brillant', 'idear', 'not', 'mention', 'involvment', 'previous', 'life', 'jinx', 'spells', 'elements', 'were', 'seem', 'way', 'too', 'superstitious', 'superhero', 'Si-Fi', 'comic', 'story', 'thus', 'idear', 'Lana', 'being', 'witch', 'completely', 'ruined', 'character.Lionel', 'second', 'selected', 'charcter', 'ruined', 'Season', '4', 'Imprisoned', 'crime', 'commited', 'magnificent', 'super', 'villan', 'had', 'managed', 'discover', 'power', 'heal', 'soul', 'turned', 'good', 'guy', 'who', 'decided', 'repent', 'guilt', 'However', 'was', 'recuperated', 'villan', 'once', 'again', 'released', 'prison', 'later', 'ends', 'up', 'being', 'paralized', 'power', 'stones', 'not', 'been', 'best', 'scenario', 'character', 'Lionel', 'Luthor.As', 'Son', 'Lex', 'finally', 'strugle', 'good', 'evil', 'chose', 'path', 'followed', 'destiny', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'who', 'did', 'allright', 'season', 'one', 'episode', 'personalities', 'was', 'spilted', 'briefly', 'shape', 'up', 'what', 'would', 'become', 'will-be', 'NO.1', 'enemy', 'superman.Krypto', 'also', 'joined', 'show', 'special', 'guest', 'dose', 'show', 'quality', 'idear', 'bringing', 'superdog', 'show', 'not', 'bad', 'only', 'extra', 'plays.Dispite', 'fact', 'producers', 'did', 'try', 'bring', 'up', 'new', 'charm', 'show', 'storyline', 'weak', 'are', 'running', 'idears', 'only', 'episode', 'really', 'price', 'season', 'finale', 'when', 'Clark', 'really', 'started', 'face', 'destiny.Let', 'face', 'fact', 'have', 'seen', 'terrible', 'season', 'let', 'put', 'expectation', 'upcoming', 'season', '5', 'will', 'be', 'final', 'season', 'Smallville']",N/A

The on-again/off-again relationship between Clark and Lana is starting to get more than a bit shopworn, and one wishes they would either just get together or call it off permanently and get on with their lives. The two episodes with Lana as a reincarnated 17th century witch were just hokey and someone should have had the sense to veto those scripts. (For example, the witch's magical powers in some ways exceed Clark's). The writers also don't seem to know quite what to do with Lex's character, as he bounces back and forth between a couple of psychotic episodes, trivial relationships with several women, and a couple of unwise deceptions which lead to imbroglios in his friendship with Clark.That having been said, I still enjoyed the season overall and there were more good episodes than bad ones, and several episodes were some of the best so far, in my humble opinion, so if you're a fan, don't give up on the series yet. I look forward to seeing if the final season can live up to the standards set by the first three or if the show will falter somemore as it did in the fourth season.One thing I wanted to mention is that DVD number 5, if I remember right, contains in the extra features section a history of the Lois Lane character, as she appeared in the original comic series, through the first TV show with Noel Neil, through the later comic books and movies, and finally up to Smallville. Lois's character is regarded as ahead of her time, as she becomes a successful reporter in what was still a man's profession. The feature includes an interview with Noel Neil, several scenes and footage from the original TV series with George Reeve, and overall was a nice idea to include in the set, and a good history of the whole Lois Lane character and concept.",4,Great series hits a few bumps,1153094400,"07 17, 2006",2006,1913,"['Smallville', 'knockout', 'seasons', '1-3', 'just', 'got', 'stronger', 'better', 'passing', 'season', 'show', 'few', 'bumps', 'season', 'four', 'on-again/off-again', 'relationship', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'starting', 'get', 'more', 'bit', 'shopworn', 'one', 'wishes', 'would', 'either', 'just', 'get', 'together', 'call', 'off', 'permanently', 'get', 'lives', 'two', 'episodes', 'Lana', 'reincarnated', '17th', 'century', 'witch', 'were', 'just', 'hokey', 'someone', 'should', 'have', 'had', 'sense', 'veto', 'scripts', 'example', 'witch', 'magical', 'powers', 'ways', 'exceed', 'Clark', 'writers', 'also', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'do', 'Lex', 'character', 'back', 'forth', 'couple', 'psychotic', 'episodes', 'trivial', 'relationships', 'several', 'women', 'couple', 'unwise', 'deceptions', 'lead', 'imbroglios', 'friendship', 'Clark.That', 'having', 'been', 'said', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'overall', 'were', 'more', 'good', 'episodes', 'bad', 'ones', 'several', 'episodes', 'were', 'best', 'so', 'far', 'humble', 'opinion', 'so', ""'re"", 'fan', 'do', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'series', 'yet', 'look', 'forward', 'seeing', 'final', 'season', 'can', 'live', 'up', 'standards', 'set', 'first', 'three', 'show', 'will', 'falter', 'somemore', 'did', 'fourth', 'season.One', 'thing', 'wanted', 'mention', 'DVD', 'number', '5', 'remember', 'right', 'contains', 'extra', 'features', 'section', 'history', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'character', 'appeared', 'original', 'comic', 'series', 'first', 'TV', 'show', 'Noel', 'Neil', 'later', 'comic', 'books', 'movies', 'finally', 'Smallville', 'Lois', 'character', 'regarded', 'ahead', 'time', 'successful', 'reporter', 'what', 'was', 'still', 'man', 'profession', 'feature', 'interview', 'Noel', 'Neil', 'several', 'scenes', 'footage', 'original', 'TV', 'series', 'George', 'Reeve', 'overall', 'was', 'nice', 'idea', 'include', 'set', 'good', 'history', 'whole', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'character', 'concept']",N/A
903125,A2ULSA0IRUE09E,B0009A5MUO,Marc Cabir Davis,"[4, 4]","Season Four of this ground-breaking show proves one thing - not one avatar of Superman before this has done the concept THIS well. At the time of writing, actor Tom Welling is officially the longest-playing Superman in history (be it radio, TV or film), and ""Smallville"" is well on its' way to being the most revolutionary TV Series ever to be created on a superhero. Nothing else comes close.There are a few things to look out for in this series, and I've listed both the good and the bad below:1. Krypto (Super-Dog) : Yes, that's right. Season Four introduces us to Super-Dog (if you're a comic book fan, you'll know that Superman had a pet dog as well as a pet Super-Cat). Krypto is eventually named `Shelby' in his introductory episode here, but he has super-powers (due to meteor rocks, and LuthorCorp testing). The dog itself is played by a reasonably cute mutt, and the storyline was solid here. In fact, the episode `Krypto' ranks as one of the best in this season.2. Lois Lane : Season Four officially introduced Lois Lane, and thank God for it. Even though actress Erica Durance claims she is about 29 years old, and is playing an eighteen year old, she actually looks about 40 (honestly), which is a bit unsettling at times. Of the entire cast, only Kristin Kreuk is playing anywhere near her real age. With Lois Lane, I expected someone a little more youthful, but Erica plays this character with so much humor and dark comedy (she also has the best one-liners), that its hard to hate her.3. Countess Margaret Isobel Thoreaux : Lana Lang continues to unravel through the season, as she is apparently the descendant of a 15th century witch in Europe. This plot was a bit nonsensical and its clear the writers had nowhere to go with it. However, at least we got to witness some awesome special effects. However, this gave the makers some license to turn Lana's eyes purple every now and then and display a few powers even greater than Clarks.4. Jason Teague : This fourth season also marked the debut of actor Jensen Ackles (CWs' ""Supernatural"") in the role of Lana's new boyfriend Jason Teague. Now Jensen is a really good actor, but you will be shocked at the speed of which they turned his character into a `bad guy' and sent him packing. Alongwith his mother Genevieve (played hilariously by Jane Seymour), this was a waste of some fine talent. In fact, I consider Jensen to be even better looking than Tom Welling, so this was a sore point indeed.5. More nudity/gratuitous sex : We are reminded early on in this season that Clark and Lana are both virgins (which is kind of unbelievable). Tom Welling has a lot more opportunity here to display some skin (not that his fans are complaining). This is one actor who has refused to strip from the waist down (which is why the most undressed you'll ever find him is with his shirt off). Kristin Kreuk is clothed throughout though.6. Clark Kent gets Married : Yes, that's right. This season has Clark getting married to resident psycho Alicia, but we're told it doesn't mean anything since they're both underage. Also, the marriage is very quickly forgotten about, which I thought was a little too convenient.7. The CHINA Episode : The episode set in China (or Chinese sets, whatever) was one of the most beautiful and visually stunning episodes I had seen of this show. I've been a fan since Season 1, but this episode, especially the parts set in the monastery with the martial arts, was just spectacular. You have to see it to believe it.8. Martha Kent possessed by the spirit of a teenager : Yes, that's right, and she lip-synchs to Ashlee Simpsons' ""La La"". This is much better than it sounds.Overall though, I have to say this was not the best season. Despite some new inclusions, many episodes felt like a total waste of time. For every episode that stuck to the storyline, we had two-three episodes that went totally off-target and had nothing to do with Clark Kent or anyone. Hardcore fans must feel cheated! However, Tom Welling has improved dramatically as an actor, though the same cannot be said of Kristin Kreuk who plays Lana Lang. The actress, who showed so much growth in Season 2, looked dazed and confused throughout this mess. The poor script didn't help her either. Also, they REALLY tried hard to get some humorous banter going between Clark and Lana, and I was like WHY did they have to bother.The other wasted actors were the ones playing the parents of Clark. They have less and less to do each season, and it is a disservice to Annette O'Toole that she is being given such woefully small parts to play these days. The only one I can say who came out truly unscathed was Allison Mack (Chloe) who just keeps growing as an actress. At times, you begin to wonder if the entire show should be written around her instead.However, the Final Episode of Season Four ties up things pretty well, and Clark gets a grip on his destiny and thwarts Lexs' evil plans. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but nothing that Season Five doesn't clarify. I only hope they give Lana Lang a much meatier role in Season Seven (now that they killed her off in Season Six).All in All, though this was one of the weaker seasons, there is enough for all fans to love and enjoy. And yes, it is monumental that they finally introduced Lois Lane, at long last.",4,Krypto to the Rescue!,1179705600,"05 21, 2007",2007,5309,"['Season', 'Four', 'ground-breaking', 'show', 'one',

I purchased Season 1...and was hooked.  So far I've purchased and watched in their entireties the first 4 seasons...and I MUST say...Season 4 is so far...by far...the BEST!  If you are a Smallville fan and haven't seen Season 4...or even if you have and could use a refresher (it DID air about 3 years ago people :) - then GET IT NOW!  If you haven't seen Smallville, but are curious about giving it a go - I would recommend starting with Season 1 - and working your way through.  While Season 4 IS amazing - there are elements from each season which build upon each other.  I mean - sure, you COULD have never watched the show, pick up Season 4...and would STILL love it - but trust me...if you put in the work of watching season 1, then 2...3...and THEN 4 - it will TOTALLY be a MUCH richer experience.In short - get it.

And good isn't even the word.  Excellent or dazzling or triumphant or captivating would be the right word.  Here goes.  Smallville is sort of like Batman Begins in that it is the story about Superman's origins.  Or the making of Clark Kent/ Superman.  Smallville stars Tom Welling (Clark Kent), Kristin Kreuk (Lana Lang), Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), Allison Mack (Chloe Sullivan), Erica Durance (Lois Lane), John Schneider (Jonathan Kent), and Annette O' Toole (Martha Kent).  John Glover also stars as Lionel Luthor.  Smallville debuted in 2001 and has been among the leaders in ratings per season ever since and is dominating the WB network.  Basically, Smallville chronicles the life of Clark and his family and friends through Clark's high school/college years.  The show is told primarily in Clark Kent's point of view and centers around Clark discovering his abilities and overcoming different obstacles each week, be it putting his life on the line for his friends or rising to the challenge to do the right thing morally, with help from Lana, Chloe and his parents primarily, or whoever should guest star in a particular episode.  Guest stars have ranged from Jonathan Taylor Thomas to Jane Seymour.  Tom Wopat makes a notable appearance in Season 5.  Wopat of course starred with John Schneider in the television series 'The Dukes of Hazzard'.  With Seasons one and two focusing primarily on getting to know the characters and simple stories from episode to episode, Seasons 3-5 have dug a lot deeper into Clark Kent's Kryptonian background.  Season 4 focuses mainly on a collection of stones that when joined together (oops can't give that part away but you'll find out on the season finale of season 4) open up things beyond your wildest dreams.  Season 4 also introduces to viewers the character of Lois Lane, played nicely by Erica Durance.  The first time we see her is in the first episode of the season.  Season 4 also marks the beginning of the descent into darkness by Lex Luthor.  Lana Lang returns from Paris in the early part of the season with her new boyfriend that she met there, the mysterious Jason Teague.  After their relationship grows and develops back in Smallville we are introduced to his mother (Jane Seymour), who will do anything to get her hands on the mysterious stones.  Of course, we all know that Lex and Lionel each have their own ambitions and desires to try and figure out the mystery behind Clark Kent.  Overall, a pretty exciting season except for the fact there is no Clana (Clark and Lana together).  We'll have to wait until season 5 for that.  Anyway, an outstanding show that will no doubt be viewed and enjoyed for years to come and go down as one of the best shows ever to be broadcast on the small screen.",5,THE BEST DAMN SHOW ON TELEVISION...PERIOD,1131494400,"11 9, 2005",2005,2896,"['Alright', 'Here', ""'m"", 'gon', 'try', 'write', 'review', 'here', 'Smallville', 'problem', 'so', 'good', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'good', ""n't"", 'even', 'word', 'Excellent', 'dazzling', 'triumphant', 'captivating', 'would', 'be', 'right', 'word', 'Here', 'Smallville', 'sort', 'Batman', 'Begins', 'story', 'Superman', 'origins', 'making', 'Clark', 'Kent/', 'Superman', 'Smallville', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Allison', 'Mack', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'John', 'Schneider', 'Jonathan', 'Kent', 'Annette', 'O', 'Toole', 'Martha', 'Kent', 'John', 'Glover', 'also', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'Smallville', 'debuted', '2001', 'been', 'leaders', 'ratings', 'season', 'ever', 'dominating', 'WB', 'network', 'Basically', 'Smallville', 'life', 'Clark', 'family', 'friends', 'Clark', 'high', 'school/college', 'years', 'show', 'told', 'primarily', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'point', 'view', 'centers', 'Clark', 'discovering', 'abilities', 'overcoming', 'different', 'obstacles', 'week', 'be', 'putting', 'life', 'line', 'friends', 'rising', 'challenge', 'do', 'right', 'thing', 'morally', 'help', 'Lana', 'Chloe', 'parents', 'primarily', 'whoever', 'should', 'guest', 'star', 'particular', 'episode', 'Guest', 'stars', 'have', 'ranged', 'Jonathan', 'Taylor', 'Thomas', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'Tom', 'Wopat', 'notable', 'appearance', 'Season', '5', 'Wopat', 'course', 'starred', 'John', 'Schneider', 'television', 'series', ""'The"", 'Dukes', 'Hazzard', 'Seasons', 'one', 'two', 'focusing', 'primarily', 'getting', 'know', 'characters', 'simple', 'stories', 'episode', 'episode', 'Seasons', '3-5', 'have', 'dug', 'lot', 'deeper', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Kryptonian', 'background', 'Season', '4', 'focuses', 'mainly', 'collection', 'stones', 'when', 'joined', 'together', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'part', 'away', ""'ll"", 'find', 'out', 'season', 'finale', 'season', '4', 'open', 'up', 'things', 'wildest', 'dreams', 'Season', '4', 'also', 'introduces', 'viewers', 'character', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'played', 'nicely', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'first', 'time', 'see', 'first', 'episode', 'season', 'Season', '4', 'also', 'beginning', 'descent', 'darkness', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'returns', 'Paris', 'early', 'part', 'season', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'met', 'there', 'mysterious', 'Jason', 'Teague', 'relationship', 'grows', 'back', 'Smallville', 'are', 'introduced', 'mother', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'who', 'will', 'do', 'anything', 'get', 'hands', 'mysterious', 'stones', 'course', 'know', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'have', 'own', 'ambitions', 'desires', 'try', 'figure', 'out', 'mystery', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'Overall', 'pretty', 'exciting', 'season', 'fact', 'Clana', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'together', ""'ll"", 'have', 'wait', 'season', '5', 'Anyway', 'outstanding', 'show', 'will', 'doubt', 'be', 'viewed', 'enjoyed', 'years', 'come', 'go', 'down', 'as', 'one', 'best', 'shows', 'ever', 'be', 'broadcast', 'small', 'screen']",N/A
903130,A3FOCW2R5LP3X4,B0009A5MUO,Michael Kent,"[3, 4]","I'm not like some of the people who have written here in that I'm not ready to give up on Smallville just yet. Granted, the fourth season was without a doubt the weakest season so far, it would have been a shame to see the show end on such a bad note.Having said that, season five is off to a strong beginning and looking more as though they've regained their focus after several bad moments from last year.We were introduced to a few new characters, one other was resurrected and, just as it was from the beginning, the Superman timeline was thrown off.The first episode, Crusade, saw to that with the introduction of Lois Lane...who previously had never met Clark prior to his arrival in Metropolis as an eager mild mannered reporter. Now I could say that the introduction of Lois was an excuse to bring another hot female onto the show (and believe me, Erica Durance is all that and more!!), but she was nothing more than a sarcastic comic foil to Clark as the season went on...I'm sorry, I can't see these two ever being a couple, never mind getting married. I lovd the additoon of Erica to the show...but wasn't that crazy with the addition of Lois...if that makes sense.The other addition in that first episode that would carry its way through the course of the season (in a bad way) was that of Jensen Ackles' Jason Teague. This addition set the stage for what has to be the most boring romance in television history. I would tape the season four eps rather than watch them live just so I could skip through the lovey-dovey Jason and Lana scenes. I kept praying that the earth would swallow them both up and let us get on with our lives.Margot Kidder's appearance was supposed to set the scene for Christopher Reeve's reprising his role as Dr. Swann but, sadly, Reeve would die before this could happen and the writers would have to find a way out of this story as the year went on.The addition of Sam Lane was unneccessary as well and while heralded at the beginning, turned out to be nothing more than a token appearance that would have not occurred at all without the addition of the Lois character.All that being said, there were a few highlights in season four:- The character of Lionel Luthor, always one of the more intriguing in the show, was probably the best utilized as he went from evil, to decent and back to his old ways again. It drove a wedge between Lex and himself, but that leads us to the next point.- I've always appreciated the efforts of Michael Rosenbaum as Lex, even though you can see him chomping at the bit for the evil side to come out. We saw a bit of that in his treatment of his father and later as he split into two Lexes, but he backed off, to our frustration, by the end of the season. Give the fans what they've been waiting for...we want the evil Lex!- Bringing back the Alicia character was a great idea. I only wish they hadn't killed her off (but then this is television) and it would have been nice to see her death affect Clark more in subsequent episodes (but then, this is...never mind). Clark truly has someone who understands him and what he has to go through and is a better fit for him than Lana ever was.- The episode ""Transference"", in which Lionel and Clark switch bodies may not be the most original premise for an episode, but it was one of the standout episodes of the season and gave Tom Welling a chance to have a little fun as Lionel being Clark.Standout episodes include the season opener ""Crusade"", ""Run"", which brings The Flash to Smallville in an actually well thought out idea, ""Transference"", the two part Alicia appearance in ""Unsafe"" and ""Pariah"" and ""Onyx"".""Spell"" has to go down as one of the worst Smallville episodes ever. The acting of the three females, Kristin Kreuk, Durance, and Alison Mack in this episode was dreadful and the idea was stupid. ""Bound"" also stands out because it introduces the most useless character in Smallville history...Jason's mother!! I'm sorry, why do we need this woman around at all, let alone several episodes?? ""Sacred"" because it involved those stupid stones that seemed to become the entire focus of the final part of the season and ""Lucy"" because Lois' sister never has been or will be relavent and, again, wouldn't have been there at all were it not for the introduction of Lois Lane.I've said all that but, in the end, I would still recommend this set to anyone...hardcore fans especially, since it does bridge the gap between season three and season five and there are just as many reasons to watch it as there are not to. Hopefully when it comes time to discuss the season five set next year, there will be no doubts about its worthiness to fans. For this to happen, we need to see Lex become truly evil, the Clark and Lana thing to play itself out...maybe even to see Lois realize she might have feelings for Clark (just to make some sense out of her now not only being there but being part of the credits). And Clark has to get past teenaged problems and begin to deal with life and his powers as an adult...Then perhaps all of this season four stuff will make some sense.",3,Things Can Only Get

Episodes like ""Covenant (season 3 ender)/Crusade"", ""Run"", Transference"" ""Unsafe"", ""Pariah"" and ""Blank"" are all fantastic. Unfortunately most of the season deals with an idiotic storyline revolving around Lana and her ancient ancestor's interest in a Kryptonian related artifact. Lana's new boyfriend, Jason, is a nice addition but they involved him in the artifact storyline so much that he serves no other purpose.As I write this, I await tonight's extended season finale ""Commencement"". Hopefully it wraps up all the loose ends and kills off the Jason character (we actually didn't see him die in the last episode) and his mother (so annoyingly over-dramatic -- she belongs on day time soaps if she isn't already). I only suggest killing them off because the show needs to get back to basics.It would be nice to see Clark and Lana make another go at the relationship. Lois wasn't used as much this season and I really think they need to up her involvement. Her relationship with Clark is still far too icy to be interesting. In fact, the best female character on the show this season is Chloe Sullivan. She has really grown and has proven to be genuine friend to Clark (especially evident in ""Blank""). Why Clark isn't interested in her...I don't know, but I love that Chloe still has a thing for Clark deep down.Also, I think it would be interesting to see Pa Kent's health deteriorate so much that Clark has to go back to his real father, Jor-El, to save him. This time, maybe Pa Kent dies and we can see Clark deal with that. I love the character of Pa Kent (played by Jon Schneider) but his role, along with his wife's, Mrs. Kent, (Annette O'Toole) is really becoming stale. I just think, whatever they do, they need to stick with the main characters and really bring them back to the forefront.I agree with the Amazon.com reviewer [...] in ""The Shark Circles"".

If it wasn't for the Chloe and Lex characters, I would have stopped watching and refuse to watch the next season. But...those two characters are fun to watch. It should be the Chloe and Lex Hour.Tom Weiling is really started to bug me with his boring acting, and Lana/boyfriend-what's-his-name/boyfriend's mother storyline was fast foward soap opera city, baby. Lois is miscasted (though hot), and really just out of place in the whole show. There's no point of her even being there, and there is no chemistry whatsoever between her and Clark. I can't believe they will fall in love in the future. I CAN believe in Chloe as a love interest, and maybe Lois will die a horrible death and Chloe takes her name as Lois Lane and they live happily ever after or something.I just hope after Smallville ends, that Chloe chick and the Lex guy have a bright future in better projects, cuz they deserve it.",2,Worst season - unfortunately,1121817600,"07 20, 2005",2005,1035,"['really', 'liked', 'Smallville', 'when', 'first', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'pretty', 'excited', 'when', 'season', 'started', 'season', 'really', 'blew', 'Super', 'boring', 'was', ""n't"", 'Chloe', 'Lex', 'characters', 'would', 'have', 'stopped', 'watching', 'refuse', 'watch', 'next', 'season', 'two', 'characters', 'are', 'fun', 'watch', 'should', 'be', 'Chloe', 'Lex', 'Hour.Tom', 'Weiling', 'really', 'started', 'bug', 'boring', 'acting', ""Lana/boyfriend-what's-his-name/boyfriend"", 'mother', 'storyline', 'was', 'fast', 'foward', 'soap', 'opera', 'city', 'baby', 'Lois', 'miscasted', 'hot', 'really', 'just', 'place', 'whole', 'show', 'point', 'even', 'being', 'there', 'chemistry', 'whatsoever', 'Clark', 'ca', ""n't"", 'believe', 'will', 'fall', 'love', 'future', 'CAN', 'believe', 'Chloe', 'love', 'interest', 'maybe', 'Lois', 'will', 'die', 'horrible', 'death', 'Chloe', 'name', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'live', 'happily', 'ever', 'something.I', 'just', 'hope', 'Smallville', 'Chloe', 'chick', 'Lex', 'guy', 'have', 'bright', 'future', 'better', 'projects', 'cuz', 'deserve']",N/A

903134,A27RJ30RN5K9MX,B0009A5MUO,Mitch Weaver,"[9, 12]","Smallville is my favorite show on television. I have been a loyal fan since the Pilot, and enjoyed each season more than the last. You would expect the show to continue this tradition and offer an amazing fourth season. Especially since it was Clark Kent's senior year, and presumably the year that he would begin to grow into the man that he would become down the road in Metropolis. Unfortunately, the momentum that season three delivered did not carry over into the fourth season. If anything, I would have to say that it was the show's weakest season overall. However, the reason I feel that it still deserves a four star rating, is because it did have some of the best episodes of the entire series in it.The season opener Crusade featured the introduction of Lois Lane, played wonderfully by the beautiful and talented Erica Durance, as well as getting to see actual flight on the show. When you combine the two, it means you are in for one amazing episode. That is what we got. It is funny, because I was just as skeptical as anyone about Lois being in Smallville during Clark Kent's teen years, and she turned out to be the bright spot of the season in my opinion. Run, featured the introduction of a teenage Flash, and this has to be my second favorite episode of all time. It was extremely well done. Other episodes worth mentioning are Tranference, in which Clark and Lionel switch bodies, Jinx, in which a teenage version of comic villan Mxyzptlk is introduced, Pariah, in which Chloe discovers the truth about Clark, Blank, in which Clark loses his memory and musy re-discover himself all over again, Onyx, in which we get to see the evil side of Lex when an experiment causes his evil half to come alive, and the great season finale Commencement.If one were to look at the fourth season on an invidual episode basis, it was a great season. A lot of enjoyable episodes were in season four. But where season four ultimately failed in my opinion, is with its continuity and overall storytelling. We were introduced to many different storylines that never really got any resolution over the course of the season, and they managed to come up with the least popular storyline in the show's history regarding Lana and her connection to a witch named Isobelle that was after three Kryptonian relics. Also, Lex Luthor was always a central character in each of the first three seasons, and his screentime was cut short severely in this season. This also affected the quality of the season, as Michael Rosenbaum is the best actor on the show.So for the most part, I still enjoyed season four. It had some truely great episodes, the introduction of a great character in Lois Lane, and a wonderful season finale that left us with some interesting things to come for season five. Unfortunately, season four still manages to fall short due to the lack of screentime for Lex, and the lack of overall continuity.4/5",4,"A good season, but certainly not great...",1116633600,"05 21, 2005",2005,2912,"['Smallville', 'favorite', 'show', 'television', 'have', 'been', 'loyal', 'fan', 'Pilot', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'more', 'last', 'would', 'expect', 'show', 'continue', 'tradition', 'offer', 'amazing', 'fourth', 'season', 'Especially', 'was', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'senior', 'year', 'presumably', 'year', 'would', 'begin', 'grow', 'man', 'would', 'become', 'down', 'road', 'Metropolis', 'Unfortunately', 'momentum', 'season', 'three', 'delivered', 'did', 'not', 'carry', 'fourth', 'season', 'anything', 'would', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'show', 'weakest', 'season', 'overall', 'However', 'reason', 'feel', 'still', 'four', 'star', 'rating', 'did', 'have', 'best', 'episodes', 'entire', 'series', 'it.The', 'season', 'opener', 'Crusade', 'featured', 'introduction', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'played', 'wonderfully', 'beautiful', 'talented', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'as', 'well', 'getting', 'see', 'actual', 'flight', 'show', 'When', 'combine', 'two', 'are', 'one', 'amazing', 'episode', 'what', 'got', 'funny', 'was', 'just', 'as', 'skeptical', 'anyone', 'Lois', 'being', 'Smallville', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'teen', 'years', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'bright', 'spot', 'season', 'opinion', 'Run', 'featured', 'introduction', 'teenage', 'Flash', 'be', 'second', 'favorite', 'episode', 'time', 'was', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'Other', 'episodes', 'mentioning', 'are', 'Tranference', 'Clark', 'Lionel', 'switch', 'bodies', 'Jinx', 'teenage', 'version', 'comic', 'villan', 'Mxyzptlk', 'introduced', 'Pariah', 'Chloe', 'truth', 'Clark', 'Blank', 'Clark', 'memory', 'musy', 're-discover', 'over', 'again', 'Onyx', 'get', 'see', 'evil', 'side', 'Lex', 'when', 'experiment', 'evil', 'half', 'come', 'alive', 'great', 'season', 'finale', 'Commencement.If', 'one', 'were', 'look', 'fourth', 'season', 'invidual', 'episode', 'basis', 'was', 'great', 'season', 'lot', 'enjoyable', 'episodes', 'were', 'season', 'four', 'where', 'season', 'four', 'ultimately', 'failed', 'opinion', 'continuity', 'overall', 'storytelling', 'were', 'introduced', 'many', 'different', 'storylines', 'never', 'really', 'got', 'resolution', 'course', 'season', 'managed', 'come', 'up', 'least', 'popular', 'storyline', 'show', 'history', 'regarding', 'Lana', 'connection', 'witch', 'named', 'Isobelle', 'was', 'three', 'Kryptonian', 'relics', 'Also', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'was', 'always', 'central', 'character', 'first', 'three', 'seasons', 'screentime', 'was', 'cut', 'short', 'severely', 'season', 'also', 'affected', 'quality', 'season', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'best', 'actor', 'show.So', 'most', 'part', 'still', 'enjoyed', 'season', 'four', 'had', 'truely', 'great', 'episodes', 'introduction', 'great', 'character', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'wonderful', 'season', 'finale', 'left', 'interesting', 'things', 'come', 'season', 'five', 'Unfortunately', 'season', 'four', 'still', 'fall', 'short', 'due', 'lack', 'screentime', 'Lex', 'lack', 'overall', 'continuity.4/5']",N/A

Now although most of the plot lines have gotten more interesting as Clark gets darker and complex, there are still some developments that are really agitating me. The main development that has caused me to give this 4th season 3 stars is the continued pushing of Lex Luthor being in love with Lana Lang. I am no Superman comic aficionado but I have read up on Superman's history which involves several plots with Lex Luthor the unrelenting, arch nemesis. Why the writers on this show have decided to start this abomination between Lex and Lana going I do not know.Lex is a 21 year old man who is head of his father's business and Lana is a nave, damsel in distress high school student. This sounds like some perversion of Lex Luthor in a direction that I don't like. I might sit out the rest of this series if this abominable story arch doesn't stop. I know Lex has done just about everything under the sun to kill Superman but could we leave wanting to go with Lana off his docket? Lana Lang is irritating and needs to be burned like the rest of Smallville due to their constant mess pulling. The only persons that should be left alive are Lex Luthor and Chloe Sullivan. I know that the message they are sending about Chloe is that no one wants her so her living doesn't matter only the beautiful Lana Lang is worth treasuring. However, I figure that this clich&eacute; storyline is apart of the usual campaign to make brainy girls feel like trash.I say watch this 4th season and see if you like it. I have always been a big fan of Superman and I always will be. I am trying to stay devoted to this show because it's a good show and I love Superman and Lex Luthor. I am finding that my favorite character on the show is Lex Luthor because the young Clark Kent spends most of his time pulling mess by lying to Lex like Lex is some fool! Lex knows that Clark is deceiving him but holds out hope as does Chloe that Clark will come clean with him for the sake of their dwindling friendship. However, in the end, I wouldn't mind seeing Lex Luthor set the whole town of Smallville ablaze making sure that Lana Lang is the first to burn!!!!!!!!!!",3,Lex Luthor taking a nasty turn!,1128124800,"10 1, 2005",2005,2262,"['latest', 'developments', 'Smallville', 'are', 'really', 'irritating', 'have', 'been', 'following', 'whole', 'series', 'started', 'Now', 'most', 'plot', 'lines', 'have', 'gotten', 'more', 'interesting', 'Clark', 'darker', 'complex', 'are', 'still', 'developments', 'are', 'really', 'agitating', 'main', 'development', 'caused', 'give', '4th', 'season', '3', 'stars', 'continued', 'pushing', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'being', 'love', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'am', 'Superman', 'comic', 'aficionado', 'have', 'read', 'up', 'Superman', 'history', 'several', 'plots', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'unrelenting', 'arch', 'nemesis', 'Why', 'writers', 'show', 'have', 'decided', 'start', 'abomination', 'Lex', 'Lana', 'going', 'do', 'not', 'know.Lex', '21', 'year', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'head', 'father', 'business', 'Lana', 'nave', 'damsel', 'distress', 'high', 'school', 'student', 'perversion', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'direction', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'might', 'sit', 'out', 'rest', 'series', 'abominable', 'story', 'arch', ""n't"", 'stop', 'know', 'Lex', 'done', 'just', 'everything', 'sun', 'kill', 'Superman', 'could', 'leave', 'wanting', 'go', 'Lana', 'docket', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'irritating', 'needs', 'be', 'burned', 'rest', 'Smallville', 'due', 'constant', 'mess', 'pulling', 'only', 'persons', 'should', 'be', 'left', 'alive', 'are', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'Chloe', 'Sullivan', 'know', 'message', 'are', 'sending', 'Chloe', 'one', 'living', ""n't"", 'matter', 'only', 'beautiful', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'worth', 'treasuring', 'However', 'figure', 'clich', 'eacute', 'storyline', 'apart', 'usual', 'campaign', 'make', 'brainy', 'girls', 'feel', 'trash.I', 'say', 'watch', '4th', 'season', 'see', 'like', 'have', 'always', 'been', 'big', 'fan', 'Superman', 'always', 'will', 'be', 'am', 'trying', 'stay', 'devoted', 'show', 'good', 'show', 'love', 'Superman', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'am', 'finding', 'favorite', 'character', 'show', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'most', 'time', 'pulling', 'mess', 'lying', 'Lex', 'Lex', 'fool', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'deceiving', 'out', 'hope', 'Chloe', 'Clark', 'will', 'come', 'clean', 'sake', 'dwindling', 'friendship', 'However', 'end', 'would', ""n't"", 'mind', 'seeing', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'set', 'whole', 'town', 'Smallville', 'ablaze', 'making', 'sure', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'first', 'burn']",N/A

Newman ""Superville""","[3, 4]","The 4th Season was full of good (a few great) momments.No really great entire episodes can be found.They recycled alot of past episodes that were good the first time but the second time just seemed repetitive.The whole Lana's possessed by a witch was totally unproductive and distracted from the whole series.What more was learned about Lana from season 4 that makes any difference?Once again it made for interesting momments but not episodes.However the fact that Cloei has found out Clarks secret has made her character mature and evolve.She seems much different than the past seasons.Although reminiscent from the Pete Ross/Clark Kent friendship, it's good to see a friend other than his parents know about his ""secret"". She still has a lot to find out and I think the writers are working it in very well. Hopefully into season 5.The reason for the 3 star rating is because so much happens in season 4 but it's all that has nothing to do with the Superman story. You could miss most of 4 and really not miss anything.However, Smallville is still one of my favorite shows and is very, very entertaining.

903137,A1BBT9XLKQDV81,B0009A5MUO,"N8 ""Buffy is Queen!!""","[2, 4]","I'm going to keep this review short and to the point.  I have always loved and been a fan of Smallville, but enough is enough.  It took way too long to get these kids out of high school.  Way too long.  None of these actors even remotely resemble high school kids.  But more importantly, the high school plot lines are just ridiculous and boring.  For every 1 episode of Smallville that is remarkable and awesome there are 5 that are just rehashes of previous Smallville episodes.  The show needs to stop doing episodes with ""random kryptonite badguys"" and start doing more shows that focus on the ongoing plot of each season and the show as a whole.  The episodes that actually contain significant plot developement are amazingly fun to watch.  Whether it's the entire cast randomly going to China, or Clark ending up in Antarctica, there are very cool parts of the show.  I just feel that more often than not, the writers make a stupid ""whodunit"" episode where a random character we never encountered before has mysterious kryptonite powers and Clark has to somehow stop them, despite of his vulnerablility to kryptonite.Season 4 has way too many of those random badguy episodes to deserve more than three stars.  The plot that wound its way throughout the whole season was amazingly cool and very enjoyable, it just took way too long to actually tell the story they were trying to tell because there were so many stupid episodes.",3,Come on already...,1126483200,"09 12, 2005",2005,1432,"[""'m"", 'going', 'keep', 'review', 'short', 'point', 'have', 'always', 'loved', 'been', 'fan', 'Smallville', 'enough', 'enough', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'get', 'kids', 'high', 'school', 'Way', 'too', 'long', 'None', 'actors', 'even', 'remotely', 'resemble', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'more', 'importantly', 'high', 'school', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'just', 'ridiculous', 'boring', '1', 'episode', 'Smallville', 'remarkable', 'awesome', 'are', '5', 'are', 'just', 'rehashes', 'previous', 'Smallville', 'episodes', 'show', 'stop', 'doing', 'episodes', 'random', 'kryptonite', 'badguys', 'start', 'doing', 'more', 'shows', 'focus', 'ongoing', 'plot', 'season', 'show', 'whole', 'episodes', 'actually', 'contain', 'significant', 'plot', 'developement', 'are', 'amazingly', 'fun', 'watch', 'entire', 'cast', 'randomly', 'going', 'China', 'Clark', 'ending', 'up', 'Antarctica', 'are', 'very', 'cool', 'parts', 'show', 'just', 'feel', 'more', 'often', 'not', 'writers', 'make', 'stupid', 'whodunit', 'episode', 'where', 'random', 'character', 'never', 'encountered', 'mysterious', 'kryptonite', 'powers', 'Clark', 'somehow', 'stop', 'vulnerablility', 'kryptonite.Season', '4', 'way', 'too', 'many', 'random', 'badguy', 'episodes', 'deserve', 'more', 'three', 'stars', 'plot', 'wound', 'way', 'whole', 'season', 'was', 'amazingly', 'cool', 'very', 'enjoyable', 'just', 'took', 'way', 'too', 'long', 'actually', 'tell', 'story', 'were', 'trying', 'tell', 'were', 'so', 'many', 'stupid', 'episodes']",N/A

Concerned for how the new movie will look, but completely satisfied with the television show ""Smallville.""I have watched each episode of ""Smallville"" since it aired in my senior year of high school.  Season 1 was excellent, albeit a bit too much of a teenage-drama.  Season 2 expanded with darker story lines, but the plot surrounding the caves left me underwhelmed to an extent.  Season 3, I will acknowledge, was a mess.  Some great episodes (""Legacy"", ""Forsaken"" ""Exile"") coupled in with some truly horrible ones (""Velocity,"" ""Magnetic,"" ""Relic"").  But, i stayed true and watched the new season this past year and i loved it.  It indeed did start out real rocky and juvenile, but after ""Transferrence"" the show got a face lift.  Any episode dealing with Lex or Lionel is always outstanding.  ""Onyx"" is another great episode showing what dark-side awaits Lex once he fully embodies who he is destined to become.  However, there were definitely some missteps along the way (""Facade,"" ""Lucy,"" ""Spirit""), but every show has those filler episodes.At the end of the day, ""Smallville"" is the best show on television and i will add Season 4 to my dvd collection when it is released.",5,"Smallville is great, honestly!",1117411200,"05 30, 2005",2005,1339,"['Background', '20', 'year-old', 'college', 'student', 'Superman', 'fan', 'first', 'time', 'i', 'saw', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'fly', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'Superman', 'Movie', 'Concerned', 'how', 'new', 'movie', 'will', 'look', 'completely', 'satisfied', 'television', 'show', 'Smallville', 'have', 'watched', 'episode', 'Smallville', 'aired', 'senior', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'excellent', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'teenage-drama', 'Season', '2', 'expanded', 'darker', 'story', 'lines', 'plot', 'surrounding', 'caves', 'left', 'underwhelmed', 'extent', 'Season', '3', 'will', 'acknowledge', 'was', 'mess', 'great', 'episodes', 'Legacy', 'Forsaken', 'Exile', 'coupled', 'truly', 'horrible', 'ones', 'Velocity', 'Magnetic', 'Relic', 'i', 'stayed', 'true', 'watched', 'new', 'season', 'past', 'year', 'i', 'loved', 'indeed', 'did', 'start', 'out', 'real', 'rocky', 'juvenile', 'Transferrence', 'show', 'got', 'face', 'lift', 'episode', 'dealing', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'always', 'outstanding', 'Onyx', 'great', 'episode', 'showing', 'what', 'dark-side', 'awaits', 'Lex', 'once', 'fully', 'who', 'destined', 'become', 'However', 'were', 'definitely', 'missteps', 'way', 'Facade', 'Lucy', 'Spirit', 'show', 'filler', 'episodes.At', 'end', 'day', 'Smallville', 'best', 'show', 'television', 'i', 'will', 'add', 'Season', '4', 'dvd', 'collection', 'when', 'released']",N/A

903141,AHOLIHT1HLOG1,B0009A5MUO,Panda Opa,"[0, 2]","Alright, there's only so much that you can do with the material presented by Smallville. With that, a huge problem is presented: Where does the story go?The season opens with a stellar episode that is perhaps Smallville's best hour. It promises you an amazing season that will move along the story and rid itself of the horrible cliches, so long as you just keep watching. But it doesn't exactly keep it's part of the deal.The season has a good plot line revolving around some new faces and some old plots, but it holds together well. The season keeps going strong at first but then seems to plunge off a cliff with episodes involving witches and other ridiculous premises. This causes the season to suffer, and one wonders why to continue watching? Well there's a good reason. Smallville always has a talent of sucking you in within the last few episodes, using cliffhangers and huge plot movement. This, in turn, causes you to just keep watching and watching. Season 4 is no different. Don't get discouraged with the bad episodes, just keep watching and it will get better. The stupid Clark and Lana thing is still going on, even though it's not as present as before. Lois Lane is introduced to the cast, hopefully to move along the idea of Clark and Lois becoming involved.The cast continues to give good performances.

903142,ADE852UR9121C,B0009A5MUO,perfecto,"[14, 16]","I am a huge Smallville fan. After a first few shaky episodes in Season 1 (probably the cast getting comfortable in their roles), Smallville has showed signs of improvement in every season it enters, and that's something rare in today's TV shows. What I've always found fascinating about this show is how it builds up to show Clark Kent becoming Superman, a concept pretty smart when you think about it...and I'm not even a Superman fan. Well, let's get on to the review.First off, Season 4 is much darker compared to it's predecessors. The main story revolves around 3 stones that are keys to something big in Clark's life, but we do not know what. Everybody's trying to get the stones and it all boils down to mistrust and lies. Lana is romantically involved with Jason in Paris, and one day she discovers a marking on her body after touching a historical artifact and she returns to Smallville because she believes it's there that the answer lies. Jason of course follows her back to Smallville to lend her a helping hand. Jason's rich mother, Genevieve Teague surprises Jason by coming to Smallville to protest their relationship. It seems that there is more than meets the eye between Lana and the Teague family, but what? Lex meanwhile, also goes out of his way to find out more about the 3 stones and what they mean. Lionel, comes fresh out of prison with a heart of gold, but can we trust that he has changed for the better? Other than all that, somewhere between the season, Alicia from Season 3 returns and Clark finds that he has feelings towards her and I don't want to sound sappy but what happened then was something that left me feeling very emotional. And Chloe as well as her nosey cousin Lois Lane are the backups Clark needs to find information to help track down the bad guys. The season ensues...Honestly, I am not sure why Smallville did not fare as good as it did the previous seasons because I thought this season was amazing. Perhaps the fact that it is getting more serious and darker, as previously mentioned...does not sit well with audiences from a younger age group. Other than the few typical episodes with Clark going after some meteor freaks and saving the day, the ""big picture"" behind Season 4 was really exciting. First of all, nobody seems to be trustworthy. Everybody has an evil streak and it shows very clearly in this season. Where in the past few seasons, things were more straightforward (like Clark's love for Lana and people trying to uncover Clark's secret)...now it has extended far beyond that and it's like a large web of deceit. And Clark is tangled in it. The lines between good and bad is blurred and even Clark makes some pretty bad decisions and later pays the price for it. Lex is slowly but surely starting to come out of his shell and although we can see small traces of good in him, it's getting covered by dark clouds. This time around, everybody has secrets and we really don't have a clue what would happen until the writer decides to let us know, because in many cases...it wouldn't be far fetched to think of a number of conclusions for the various scenarios presented here. Thankfully, the writers come up with good and interesting ways to tie up things and end the season with a fantastic finale to whet our appetites for Season 5.A small note about the season finale. It was breath-taking. Honestly, the effects in this episode looks like something you would see in movies. I have no idea how much WB must've spent but I bet it would've been a significant ammount. And also the things happening, it's like an information overload, miss a minute of it...and you would be lost. The way things start to turn out at the end of this season, I guess we will see maybe 1 or at most 2 seasons left of Smallville. But I really have to say ""Well Done"" for a great season finale.In my opinion, the reason this series works so well is because of the writers. They present the Superman story very well, although sometimes the episodes seem lacking in excitement or creativity, parts of it does add to the bigger story they are trying to convey. The acting is also great as usual, particularly from the series' main actors. Tom Welling is exceptional as Clark Kent, who is always in doubt and trying to figure out about his origins and who he can trust. The ever cool Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover make perfect Luthors. Their conversation and quips are a joy to watch always. The rest although not as outstanding, do a more than fine job as well.Honestly, few shows enthrall me as much as Smallville. I am dying with anticipation to see what the next season holds for us. But whatever it is, I am sure the writers will do a hell of a good job. That's how much confidence I have in this show.",5,The best season yet...spoiler free review,1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,4746,"['am', 'huge', 'Smallville', 'fan', 'first', 'few', 'shaky', 'episodes', 'Season', '1', 'probably', 'cast', 'getting', 'comfortable', 'roles', 'Smallville', 'showed', 'signs', 'improvement', 'season', 'something', 'rare', 'today', 'TV', 'shows', 'What', ""'ve"", 'always', 'found', 'fascinating', 'show', 'how', 'show', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'becoming', 'Superman', 'concept', 'pretty', 'smart', 'when', 'think', ""'m"", 'not', 'even', 'Superman', 'fan', 'Well', 'let', 'get', 'review.First', 'off', 'Season', '4', 'much', 'darker', 'compared', 'predecessors', 'main', 'story', 'revolves', '3', 'stones', 'are', 'keys', 'something', 'big', 'Clark', 'life', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'what', 'Everybody', 'trying', 'get', 'stones', 'down', 'mistrust', 'Lana', 'romantically', 'involved', 'Jason', 'Paris', 'one', 'day', 'marking', 'body', 'touching', 'historical', 'artifact', 'Smallville', 'answer', 'Jason', 'course', 'back', 'Smallville', 'lend', 'helping', 'hand', 'Jason', 'rich', 'mother', 'Genevieve', 'Teague', 'surprises', 'Jason', 'coming', 'Smallville', 'protest', 'relationship', 'more', 'eye', 'Lana', 'Teague', 'family', 'what', 'Lex', 'meanwhile', 'also', 'way', 'find', 'out', 'more', '3', 'stones', 'what', 'mean', 'Lionel', 'fresh', 'prison', 'heart', 'gold', 'can', 'trust', 'changed', 'better', 'Other', 'somewhere', 'season', 'Alicia', 'Season', '3', 'returns', 'Clark', 'feelings', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'sound', 'sappy', 'what', 'happened', 'then', 'was', 'something', 'left', 'feeling', 'very', 'emotional', 'Chloe', 'as', 'well', 'nosey', 'cousin', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'are', 'backups', 'Clark', 'find', 'information', 'help', 'track', 'down', 'bad', 'guys', 'season', 'ensues', 'Honestly', 'am', 'not', 'sure', 'why', 'Smallville', 'did', 'not', 'fare', 'as', 'good', 'did', 'previous', 'seasons', 'thought', 'season', 'was', 'amazing', 'Perhaps', 'fact', 'getting', 'more', 'serious', 'darker', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'not', 'sit', 'well', 'audiences', 'younger', 'age', 'group', 'Other', 'few', 'typical', 'episodes', 'Clark', 'going', 'meteor', 'freaks', 'saving', 'day', 'big', 'picture', 'Season', '4', 'was', 'really', 'exciting', 'First', 'nobody', 'be', 'trustworthy', 'Everybody', 'evil', 'streak', 'very', 'clearly', 'season', 'Where', 'past', 'few', 'seasons', 'things', 'were', 'more', 'straightforward', 'Clark', 'love', 'Lana', 'people', 'trying', 'uncover', 'Clark', 'secret', 'now', 'extended', 'far', 'large', 'web', 'deceit', 'Clark', 'tangled', 'lines', 'good', 'bad', 'blurred', 'even', 'Clark', 'pretty', 'bad', 'decisions', 'later', 'price', 'Lex', 'slowly', 'surely', 'starting', 'come', 'shell', 'can', 'see', 'small', 'traces', 'good', 'getting', 'covered', 'dark', 'clouds', 'time', 'around', 'everybody', 'secrets', 'really', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue', 'would', 'happen', 'writer', 'let', 'know', 'many', 'cases', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'far', 'fetched', 'think', 'number', 'conclusions', 'various', 'scenarios', 'presented', 'here', 'Thankfully', 'writers', 'come', 'up', 'good', 'interesting', 'ways', 'tie', 'up', 'things', 'end', 'season', 'fantastic', 'finale', 'whet', 'appetites', 'Season', '5.A', 'small', 'note', 'season', 'finale', 'was', 'breath-taking', 'Honestly', 'effects', 'episode', 'something', 'would', 'see', 'movies', 'have', 'idea', 'how', 'much', 'WB', 'must', ""'ve"", 'spent', 'bet', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'significant', 'ammount', 'also', 'things', 'happening', 'information', 'overload', 'miss', 'minute', 'would', 'be', 'lost', 'way', 'things', 'start', 'turn', 'out', 'end', 'season', 'guess', 'will', 'see', 'maybe', '1', 'most', '2', 'seasons', 'left', 'Smallville', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'Well', 'Done', 'great', 'season', 'finale.In', 'opinion', 'reason', 'series', 'so', 'well', 'writers', 'present', 'Superman', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'sometimes', 'episodes', 'seem', 'lacking', 'excitement', 'creativity', 'parts', 'add', 'bigger', 'story', 'are', 'trying', 'convey', 'acting', 'also', 'great', 'usual', 'particularly', 'series', 'main', 'actors', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'exceptional', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'who', 'always', 'doubt', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'origins', 'who', 'can', 'trust', 'ever', 'cool', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'John', 'Glover', 'make', 'perfect', 'Luthors', 'conversation', 'quips', 'are', 'joy', 'watch', 'always', 'rest', 'not', 'outstanding', 'do', 'more', 'fine', 'job', 'well.Honestly', 'few', 'shows', 'enthrall', 'as', 'much', 'Smallville', 'am', 'dying', 'anticipation', 'see', 'what', 'next', 'season', 'am', 'sure', 'writers', 'will', 'do', 'hell', 'good', 'job', 'how', 'much', 'confidence', 'have', 'show']",N/A
903143,A3S0IVFM83ZSE7,B0009A5MUO,P. Hardy,"[10, 20]","After the third season's finale ""Covenant"" which was highly un-stomach-able because of the heavy angst and drama, I wasn't expecting much in the ways of a better season. What do I have to say about season Four of Smallville? They didn't help my suspicions any when they decided to put Lois Lane (Erica Durance) into the show's new season either. I mean, sure it would draw attention to Superman fans or just Lois Lane fans (I happen to be one of them. A fan of the Lois Lane from SM: TAS anyway) but would it do anything for the ""story"" of Smallville itself? Nope, but she was a nice filler for the recently departed Sam Jones III. Anyway the creators of Smallville or producers, whichever, stated that they wanted, after putting me through the ringer of the oh-so predictable drama of Season 3 (reminiscent of P!nk's Mizundastood and Avril Lavinge's Under my Skin. Both are more overly dramatic than their poppy predecessors), to go back to what made the first and second seasons good.This would be great except for that they basically rehashed every concept that came to the writers mind and just put the characters in different if not the same situations. There is no originality (save for the episodes ""Run"" and ""Krypto"") in any of the episodes. It's just the same thing all the time. There's more even more focus on the sexuality this time around; Clark apparently can't keep his hormones in check when a woman either tries to dose him with her bad pink breath (a concept stolen from Stargate-SG1's episode ""Hathor"" in Smallville's s2 episode ""Heat""), red kryptonite, or just saunters up to him with her head lowered and her eyes averted up at him wearing skirts that really look like shirts, cleavage showing shirts that you can almost see through, etc.Clark just looks beyond stupid and allows them jump all over him like the idiot he is. This is supposed to be funny when he's stammering or supposed to be uncomfortable with the situations, but ITS NOT. What really bothered me was the line that Lana made in the episode Scare, where she goes: ""I can lie to myself as much as I want, but I've always been in love with you,"" and the two proceed to have implied sex with each other until the unnecessary character Jason Teague shows up and gives Clark --- CLARK KENT ---- a thrashing . They constantly rehash the Lana/Clark no-sided relationship in an attempt to gain ratings. I mean through half the entire four Season until the episodes ""Spirit"",""Blank"", ""Ageless"", ""Forever"" and ""Commencement"", they have Lana despising Clark in every way she could because she blames him for their crummy relationship as though she had nothing to do with the rocky ground they stood upon. And then suddenly they become friends after Clark recovers from the half-baked plot-amnesia. That's like Lex threatening Lana to close the talon and kick her out of the apartment, (which Martha Kent owns in ""Onyx"") or Lana speeding around in expensive SUV's she can't afford, and so on. This is probably one of the most disjointed character relationships in all of history (aside from every other disjointed character relationship on TV). And the show only gets worse in the episode Unsafe, where the mentally unstable character Alicia Baker returns. Clark immediately thinks she cured and starts a quick relationship with the girl against his parents' heeding. Alicia doses Clark with Red-Kryptonite, only proving she isn't cured. The two get unofficially married afterward but Alicia makes a mistake and breaks Clark's red-k necklace while they attempt to have sex (yet again), Clark comes to his senses and returns to Smallville. Alicia saves him from an attack from her creepy-doctor and afterward Clark proceeds to tell his parents about what had happened in Las Vegas, the two are justifiably angered by his actions. This was my favorite scene in the entire episode, Martha (instead of Jonathan) actually chews her son out for his irresponsible actions and in Pariah they're still disappointed in him (A+ of the episode, Alicia Baker Dies). These kind of things make me happy; Parents acting like parents when the teenager does something wrong.[THE BAD]:The characters of this series are supposed to be more mature having gone through all the changes in their lives, I haven't seen one mature personality in any of the characters, except maybe Chloe Sullivan who over the course of this show's short time on Television has gone from the best-friend with a crush on a ""Farm boy"" to a more likeable and sensible person in some ways. But she still remains to be annoying when it comes to her comments about Smallville being ""landoftheweird"" (Buffy: The vampire slayer, anyone?) and her seemingly endless reservoir of contacts in practically every department of Smallville (no one has that many contacts). Lex still acts like the high-and mighty unlikeable person he always has been, but this time he is seen less of and his made too kind. They've nothing to make him seem like a soon-to-be villain. Jonathan and Martha still don't do much of anything now except make small appearances and give Clark advice. For characters are supposedly main characters in this show they don't have much personality or character, let alone development aside from the occasional injuries, processions, lectures, and farm/bill work. The two of them are as about the same as they were when this series began. Giving parental advice to their son, sitting around sipping on their coffee and talking about --- surprise, surprise ---- Clark. There is no life for personality outside of this and this ticks me off to no end (They're still my favorite characters out of everyone in the show).""Lana was supposed to be the more matured and aged character in this season's Smallville,"" but the truth of the matter is Lana's character just got worse and I believe there is no redeeming her either. Instead of changing her all they did with Lana's character was put more mascara on her face dressed her up in black and revealing clothes, and made her more whinny. She's got a new boyfriend named Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), which kinda makes you think that there will be no more Clark/Lana drama anymore but this just adds onto the Clark/Lana tension in the show, only now its Jason/Lana/Clark Bermuda triangle. Jason acts just like her former boyfriend, Whitney, always questioning her about Clark or why things never worked out with Clark. It kinda makes me wonder what Gough and Millar are thinking. And throughout all the episodes of the fourth season Lana does nothing but comment about how people have been lying to her, how Clark or Jason have been untruthful to her, or how you cannot escape your own destiny or how if you don't tell how people how you feel about them and you keep lying to them, it'll just get worse until its.... too late. Lana Lang's character in the Superman Universe was basically the extra character and rival to Lois Lane for Clark Kent, other than that she's not even important.Clark on the other hand, hasn't changed for the good, just the worse. Tom Welling, portrays less and less of what I hoped or might hoped would become a future Superman and more and more of a boy with Superman related powers with a weakness to all things Kryptonite (Red- Black -and - Green). He still mopes around about Lana upon her return to Smallville in search for answers for the missing twelve hours in her life after she awakens in her home in Paris branded with a strange Tattoo upon her back, so close to the backside its uncomfortable to even look at when the Camera pans down there. He still wants to play football despite his father's warnings. Truth be told Clark acts more like a dumbroad and selfish young man than a up and coming super-hero that stands for truth, justice and the American way (with the occasional disagreements with Batman).And after making up with Lex, he still doesn't further trust him and lies unnecessarily in his so-called friend's face. Not to worry though, Lex does the same thing as well in justification. There are so many things wrong with his character I cannot count how many. Lastly, Lois Lane's character is about as one-decisional as a piece of paper. She really doesn't remind you of that cocky and smart-mouthed reporter of Metropolis who nicknames Clark Kent ""Smallville"" and would do anything to grab a story. instead she is shown vice-versa: She has no interest in journalism, she dislikes it--- and basically has no flare for uncovering mysteries/scandles. I know Smallville is before Superman, and the characters aren't supposed to be as they are in the DC comic, but the writers could've kept some of the elements that made Lois, Lois. They have Durance stating cheesy Superman-quotes to Clark. She does is makes witty comments about Clark in the nude and how her father is such a drill Sargent or how life with her sister Lucy wasn't all that is was cracked up to be after her mother died, and so on. The good thing about her is that she isn't bewitched by Clark's so-called good looks and Kent Charm.[THE UGLY]:There weren't many good episodes, just a mish-mash of them in the fourth season. The plot apparently is about a bunch of stones that Jor-El (Terence Stamp) has placed in the far regions of the earth and wants Kal-El to retrieve before anyone can get there hands on it. A now-possessed Lana Lang and her ancestor Isobel, a witch, are also in search of the stones, but she and Kal-El aren't the only ones after them. Jason and his Mother Genevieve Teague are after them as well, not for power supposedly but the safety of their blood-line (for Isobel and the Teague family apparently were at odds with each other for reasons unknown) or its just a crummy subplot. Lionel Luthor wanted them for the simple task of prolonging his life but since a past Body snatching incident he's gone and decided to do good things for the world only to end up evil again after losing in a fencing match to ""Evil Lex"" in the episode ""Onyx.""But afterward, we find the idiotic stones plot put on the back burner for other scenarios that happened in the following bad episodes: (1): 4-03 - Facade,  (2): 4-04 - Devoted,  (3): 4-07 - Jinx, (4): 4-08 - Spell, (5): 4-09 - Bound, (6): 4-10 - Scare, (7): 4-11 - Unsafe, (8): 4-12:  Pariah, (9): 4-13 - Recruit, (10): 4-15 - Sacred, (11): 4-16 - Lucy, (12): 4-17 - Onyx, (13): 4-18 - Spirit, (14): 4-19 - Blank - (15): 4-20 - Ageless. Now all of these episodes especially Bound (a useless episode made up for sex), Sacred (where'd Lana got the outfit from?), Spell (Hocus Pocus type episode), Ageless, Forever, & Spirit are indeed a mishmash of uneventful happenings and a product of bad writing and direction of an already disjointed story. (16): 4-22 - Commencement, and (17): 4-21 - Forever, are episodes in the middle.[THE GOOD]:1): 4-01 - Crusade * * * * * (Flying scenes. Pretty good premire Plot)2): 4-02 - Gone * * * (Lois Lane - The Kents - General Sam Lane/Michael Ironside)3): 4-05 - Run * * * * * (Wallace ""Wally"" West. Aka ""The Flash"".

Horrible plot -)Maybe I'm picky, but I know good episodes and TV itself when I see it. Fortunately Smallville S4 managed have small amounts of cool episodes this year 2004/2005. All in all this season has had only seven and a-half out of sixteen episodes that were actually good in my opinion with a finale that was the coolest disaster movie-wise and could've been better in the story department. Hopefully this fall's season five is better.

903146,A31U2QT7SAL7K,B0009A5MUO,"Reginald D. Garrard ""the G-man""","[4, 4]","As a big fan of the now-seven-year-old show, it pains me to give it less than four stars; however, season three ranks as probably its weakest one. The series, still sporting the high quality look and the exemplary acting, fell short this year in the writing.  Ironically, one of the bonuses on the disc is a short documentary devoted to the writing staff.Perhaps, the group was trying to convince itself that it had done its best. Sadly, it had not.Season four features the ill-advised ""Lana Lang, teenage witch"" storyline wherein Clark's main lady discovers that she is descended from a French sorceress.  Lana (Kristen Kreuk} also embarks on a doomed relationship with Smallville High's assistant football coach (new cast member Jensen Ackles).  As for Ackles, his character goes through a major personality change, beginning the year as a young man of calm and rationality - in most respects, save his judgment to date a minor - to a bona-fide psycho by season's end.Guest star Jane Seymour gets to exhibit her ""bad girl side"" in several episodes as she plays Genevieve, the malevolent mother of Ackles' character.According to the liner notes on the DVD box, the producers wanted a ""lighter"" season than previous ones.  They succeeded but came up with a rather disjointed one, at that.  In paying homage to the show's comic book roots, the show introduced Krypto, the super-dog, and a young ""Flash,"" with mixed results.Even the season premiere (""Crusade""), featuring Clark (Tom Welling) discovering his flying ability lacks the spark of the third season ending one.There were a few gems in the season, though: ""Transference,"" ""Onyx,"" ""Spell,"" ""Ageless,"" the Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon-influenced ""Sacred,"" the dark comedy of ""Spirit,"" and ""Commencement"" possess the stellar better quality of the previous three seasons.The addition of Erica Durance as ""Lois Lane"" was a stroke of genius.  The actress provides the ""yin"" to Welling's ""yang"" and it makes for a most fascinating contrast.Also, the compilation sports a fascinating tribute to the actresses that have played Lois Lane over the years.Though the set does not represent the show at its best, it is still a necessity if one wants to understand developments that arise in succeeding seasons....that, in itself, makes it worthy of purchase.",3,Disappointing fourth season following three incredibly good ones!,1195948800,"11 25, 2007",2007,2302,"['big', 'fan', 'now-seven-year-old', 'show', 'give', 'less', 'four', 'stars', 'however', 'season', 'three', 'ranks', 'probably', 'weakest', 'one', 'series', 'still', 'sporting', 'high', 'quality', 'look', 'exemplary', 'acting', 'fell', 'short', 'year', 'writing', 'Ironically', 'one', 'bonuses', 'disc', 'short', 'documentary', 'devoted', 'writing', 'staff.Perhaps', 'group', 'was', 'trying', 'convince', 'had', 'done', 'best', 'Sadly', 'had', 'four', 'ill-advised', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'teenage', 'witch', 'storyline', 'wherein', 'Clark', 'main', 'lady', 'discovers', 'descended', 'French', 'sorceress', 'Lana', 'Kristen', 'Kreuk', 'also', 'doomed', 'relationship', 'Smallville', 'High', 'assistant', 'football', 'coach', 'new', 'cast', 'member', 'Jensen', 'Ackles', 'Ackles', 'character', 'major', 'personality', 'change', 'beginning', 'year', 'young', 'man', 'calm', 'rationality', 'most', 'respects', 'save', 'judgment', 'date', 'minor', 'bona-fide', 'psycho', 'season', 'end.Guest', 'star', 'Jane', 'Seymour', 'exhibit', 'bad', 'girl', 'side', 'several', 'episodes', 'Genevieve', 'malevolent', 'mother', 'Ackles', 'character.According', 'liner', 'notes', 'DVD', 'box', 'producers', 'wanted', 'lighter', 'season', 'previous', 'ones', 'succeeded', 'came', 'up', 'rather', 'disjointed', 'one', 'paying', 'homage', 'show', 'comic', 'book', 'roots', 'show', 'introduced', 'Krypto', 'super-dog', 'young', 'Flash', 'mixed', 'results.Even', 'season', 'premiere', 'Crusade', 'featuring', 'Clark', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'discovering', 'flying', 'ability', 'spark', 'third', 'season', 'ending', 'one.There', 'were', 'few', 'gems', 'season', 'Transference', 'Onyx', 'Spell', 'Ageless', 'Crouching-Tiger-Hidden-Dragon-influenced', 'Sacred', 'dark', 'comedy', 'Spirit', 'Commencement', 'possess', 'stellar', 'better', 'quality', 'previous', 'three', 'seasons.The', 'addition', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'was', 'stroke', 'genius', 'actress', 'yin', 'Welling', 'yang', 'most', 'fascinating', 'contrast.Also', 'compilation', 'sports', 'fascinating', 'tribute', 'actresses', 'have', 'played', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'years.Though', 'set', 'not', 'represent', 'show', 'best', 'still', 'necessity', 'one', 'understand', 'developments', 'arise', 'succeeding', 'seasons', '.that', 'worthy', 'purchase']",N/A

This season, however, was an awful mish-mosh of bad plots and 'let's copy this movie idea and put it on our show'. Only the exceptional John Glover and the clearly struggling Tom Welling in ""Transference"" were able to show moments of comedy, wit and originality. The rest of it was inarguably lackluster.The Lana Lang of this production has become an fetish for the writers, from the ridiculous tattoo/witch storyline to her idiotic reasoning for not going to college (because it would be what others would expect from her).  Chloe Sullivan, the strongest of the younger female characters and the one viewers express the most interest in seeing more of, is given moments of insight, nightmarish revelations of her inner fears (in ""Scare"")but is still not spared the humilating, dragged out and doomed crush she harbors on Clark Kent (in the rancid ""Spirit""). Annette O'Toole, another wonderful and wasted actress, neglects to berate her son after his Kryptonite enhanced crime spree seasons back, but is quick to blame him for the marriage he was coerced into while also under the influence of Kryptonite (in ""Unsafe""). One thing that can be said about this season - the inconsistency is constant, at least.Michael Rosenbaum, an actor who has had the most success with his ""Smallville"" character is unfortunately given the 'light-switch' approach in evil.  His character, previously a serial monogomist in relationships, suddenly indulges in several casual and consensual sexual encounters and the twisted morality of Clark Kent sees the Lex - not the consenting women - as the villain of the arrangement. His physical self is later split into two separate incarnations of his two personalities in ""Onyx"" and the cool, collected, sardonic Lex Luthor of comic lore is treated as a cartoonish, pulpish cretin. What an utterly pointless and wasteful use of a wonderfully nuanced actor.Then mid/end season, we were treated to ""Spell"", ""Lucy"", ""Sacred"", ""Krypto"" and the ""House of Wax"" ripoff, ""Forever"".  Their badness once experienced, will make you never want to speak in detail about them ever again.Falling in love with what you can do on a show does not negate your obligation to do what you should do on a television series with the possibility of combining dramatic punch, comedic twists and premonitory vision.

903151,A16QODENBJVUI1,B0009A5MUO,Robert Moore,"[303, 323]","Season Four of SMALLVILLE saw the major characters all beginning to make the transition from adolescence to adulthood, reflecting the beginnings of the show itself to begin the transition to the next level.  The fundamental challenge for the show has been to reinvent the ""Superboy"" years by conceiving Clark Kent as a work in progress, a profoundly gifted young man gradually gaining use of and control over powers that makes him utterly unique but also alienates him from his friends by the need to keep his abilities secret.  During each season he has discovered new abilities, first X-ray vision, then heat vision, then super hearing to go with the super strength, speed, and invulnerability that he has long possessed.  Plus the hints of the impending ability to fly.  The difference between SMALLVILLE and the Superboy comics I read growing up is that the latter were always utterly ahistorical, intentionally oblivious to everything that would take place for the adult Clark Kent.  There was Lana Lang, but no reflection on how things would go with them, how they would fail to forge a permanent attachment, how Clark would later focus his attention on Lois Lane instead.  To its credit, SMALLVILLE has always proceeded with one eye cocked towards the future.  In this season, the show began what could be a metamorphosis into a more mature show.  I would not at all be surprised if in the next year or so SMALLVILLE were cancelled and a new show, perhaps called METROPOLIS, would be taking its place, with a small number of characters making the transition to the new show:  Clark, Lex, Lionel, Lois, and perhaps Chloe, with guest appearances by some Smallville regulars.  I've thoroughly enjoyed the four seasons of SMALLVILLE, but my own belief is that they are coming close to exhausting the possibilities in the story of Clark Kent's youth in Smallville.  Hopefully they will take the story to the next level.  Bit by bit they have added elements of the future to the show, and this persisted into Season Four's finale, [...].  And [...] is it unreasonable to assume that he will add the ability to fly at will in Season Five [...]Though this was another good season, it was perhaps less consistent than the two previous ones.  The season was hurt by two things:  1) a number of weak episodes and 2) a dismal storyline in which Lana Lang somehow channeled the spirit of a dead 17th century French sorceress.  It wasn't just that Lana's possession was a bad idea, it didn't lead to any great resolution.  As much as I enjoy Kristin Kreuk aka ""The Cutest Young Woman in the World"" as Lana, she simply doesn't possess the acting chops to pull off multiple persona in convincing fashion.  [...]  Simultaneously, Erica Durance was introduced to the cast as Clark's inevitable love interest Lois Lane.  These were just two of many slight changes that started scooting the series towards the future.  Lex, for instance, started more and more showing his willingness to submerge his genuine affection for his friends for his own ambitious ends.  In the season finale he even physically assaults Lana to forcibly take from her an object he imagines she possesses.[...]I look forward to Season Five.  This is clearly a show that is on the verge of exhausting its concept, and I'm profoundly sceptical that they can continue it beyond the coming season.  I hope that the show's producers and the WB can negotiate bringing this show to a graceful conclusion and then transitioning several key characters to a new show that continues the adventures of everyone's favorite Man of Steel in the big city of Metropolis.",5,The transition to the saga of the adult Clark Kent begins,1118793600,"06 15, 2005",2005,3614,"['Season', 'Four', 'SMALLVILLE', 'saw', 'major', 'characters', 'beginning', 'make', 'transition', 'adolescence', 'adulthood', 'reflecting', 'beginnings', 'show', 'begin', 'transition', 'next', 'level', 'fundamental', 'challenge', 'show', 'been', 'reinvent', 'Superboy', 'years', 'conceiving', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'work', 'progress', 'profoundly', 'gifted', 'young', 'man', 'gradually', 'gaining', 'use', 'control', 'powers', 'utterly', 'unique', 'also', 'friends', 'need', 'keep', 'abilities', 'secret', 'season', 'discovered', 'new', 'abilities', 'first', 'X-ray', 'vision', 'then', 'heat', 'vision', 'then', 'hearing', 'go', 'super', 'strength', 'speed', 'invulnerability', 'long', 'possessed', 'hints', 'impending', 'ability', 'fly', 'difference', 'SMALLVILLE', 'Superboy', 'comics', 'read', 'growing', 'up', 'latter', 'were', 'always', 'utterly', 'ahistorical', 'intentionally', 'oblivious', 'everything', 'would', 'take', 'place', 'adult', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'was', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'reflection', 'how', 'things', 'would', 'go', 'how', 'would', 'fail', 'forge', 'permanent', 'attachment', 'how', 'Clark', 'would', 'later', 'focus', 'attention', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'instead', 'credit', 'SMALLVILLE', 'always', 'proceeded', 'one', 'eye', 'cocked', 'future', 'season', 'show', 'began', 'what', 'could', 'be', 'metamorphosis', 'more', 'mature', 'show', 'would', 'not', 'all', 'be', 'surprised', 'next', 'year', 'so', 'SMALLVILLE', 'were', 'cancelled', 'new', 'show', 'perhaps', 'called', 'METROPOLIS', 'would', 'be', 'taking', 'place', 'small', 'number', 'characters', 'making', 'transition', 'new', 'show', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'Lois', 'perhaps', 'Chloe', 'guest', 'appearances', 'Smallville', 'regulars', ""'ve"", 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'four', 'seasons', 'SMALLVILLE', 'own', 'belief', 'are', 'coming', 'close', 'exhausting', 'possibilities', 'story', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'youth', 'Smallville', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'take', 'story', 'next', 'level', 'Bit', 'bit', 'have', 'added', 'elements', 'future', 'show', 'persisted', 'Season', 'Four', 'finale', '[', ']', '[', ']', 'unreasonable', 'assume', 'will', 'add', 'ability', 'fly', 'will', 'Season', 'Five', '[', 'was', 'good', 'season', 'was', 'perhaps', 'less', 'consistent', 'two', 'previous', 'ones', 'season', 'was', 'hurt', 'two', 'things', '1', 'number', 'weak', 'episodes', '2', 'dismal', 'storyline', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'somehow', 'channeled', 'spirit', 'dead', '17th', 'century', 'French', 'sorceress', 'was', ""n't"", 'just', 'Lana', 'possession', 'was', 'bad', 'idea', 'did', ""n't"", 'lead', 'great', 'resolution', 'As', 'much', 'enjoy', 'Kristin', 'Kreuk', 'Cutest', 'Young', 'Woman', 'World', 'Lana', 'simply', ""n't"", 'possess', 'acting', 'chops', 'pull', 'off', 'multiple', 'persona', 'convincing', 'fashion', '[', ']', 'Simultaneously', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'was', 'introduced', 'cast', 'Clark', 'inevitable', 'love', 'interest', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'were', 'just', 'two', 'many', 'slight', 'changes', 'started', 'scooting', 'series', 'future', 'Lex', 'instance', 'started', 'more', 'more', 'showing', 'willingness', 'submerge', 'genuine', 'affection', 'friends', 'own', 'ambitious', 'ends', 'season', 'finale', 'even', 'physically', 'assaults', 'Lana', 'forcibly', 'take', 'object', 'possesses.', '[', ']', 'look', 'forward', 'Season', 'Five', 'clearly', 'show', 'verge', 'exhausting', 'concept', ""'m"", 'profoundly', 'sceptical', 'can', 'continue', 'coming', 'season', 'hope', 'show', 'producers', 'WB', 'can', 'negotiate', 'bringing', 'show', 'graceful', 'conclusion', 'then', 'transitioning', 'several', 'key', 'characters', 'new', 'show', 'adventures', 'everyone', 'favorite', 'Man', 'Steel', 'big', 'city', 'Metropolis']",N/A
903152,A1OBPHRXHZF8P6,B0009A5MUO,"Robin Orlowski ""political activist""","[3, 5]","Clark Kent and the Smallville High class of 2005 began their senior year with high expectations-after all, they weathered the typical stresses of adolescence and then everything else. Their senior year offered more of the same high-stress environment, albeit not at the same quality as prior seasons. Critical parts of this 21-episode 2004-2005 season were mediocre.First, Chloe (Alison Mack) is involved in a very lame `is she or isn't she dead' plotline for the first couple of episodes. Rather than being intriguing, the carry over from Season Three does not do anything for the discerning Smallville viewer. Ultimately of course, she is-being a main continuing character in this very series practically facilitates her living.The only remotely good thing is that Lionel Luthor is openly ending the `saint' act---he dispatched a mutant to ensure that the high school journalist is really dead. I know it's supposed to be a small Kansas town, but sending a superhuman after a nosy high school journalist is a little extreme.Lois Lane (Erica Durrance) is not supposed to meet up with Clark in Smallville  or be  Chloe's cousin (""Lois""). She is supposed to be the brassy reporter he is paired with upon arriving at the Daily Planet, and actually does not look a thing like the Lois's which I have previously seen. Having Lois know so much about Clark's world so soon is just wrong. It's obvious the writing department was grasping for straws during this 22 episode season.I liked ""Krypto"" because it was funny seeing Clark having to teach somebody else about their powers. I also liked ""Forever"" because the prospect of having to perpetually live out my high school years is very spooky indeed. Finally, ""Blank"" shows what an all around nice guy Clark is, he realizes that the person who robbed the Talon ultimately wasn't a bad person, but that Kevin Grady was trying to survive through erasing people's minds for their money; normally he only went for the pat couple of minutes but Clark's exchange inadvertently erased his whole memory.This latter episode is also memorable because (borrowing from the queer-disability analogies readily present in earlier seasons) Clark discovers that Kevin was put in the Summerholt Institution for `deprogramming' by his mother. He later learns that the memory which he has of killing his mother was manufactured to cover up for a spousal murder. Kevin himself is perfectly fine-and we can almost envision him becoming some kind of superhero in the future.It also marks where Chloe finds out about Clark's secret and has to help him understand all of its facets when he receives amnesia after inadvertently getting blasted by the ray.  Chloe's understanding later convinces a restored Clark that sharing his secret with her would be okay. Not only did Chloe express empathy but she even tried to steer Clark away from people who would exploit his powers (thinking back to the earliest seasons when she would have been the first to do so---in tandem with the Luthors.Chloe now knowing about Clark's `difference' from her and the other Smallvile residents is a nice twist-even if she does not have all of the details yet. However the developing relationship between the two is another example of something not existing in the Superman universe. Both Alison Mack and Tom Welling looked as if they would rather be somewhere else when filming this series, also aware that Smallville is now on limited time.Clark Kent had previously decided (in Season 1) that joining the football team would not be fair to anybody whom he played with. So this season he joins the football team (""Devoted"") and conveniently ignores his past promise. This is a really big continuity gap because the writers now stopped trying to have episodes of their own series match up with each other. The only interesting part of this episode is that the cheerleaders are using kryptonite laced water to turn their football player boyfriends into Stepford-drones, scripts like this usually have the women being controlled by men.Alicia Baker (Sarah Carter) who had an obsession with Clark (""Obsession"") during the third season of this series returns to Smallville (""Unsafe""). Supposedly cured, she returns to Smallville and---resumes right where she left off. Because he is understandably reluctant about entering into a relationship with her, she then exposes him to red Kryptonite. His judgment severely impaired, Clark and Alicia then travel to Las Vegas to get married.  The normally calm Martha Kent is so upset by this action that her yelling actually reduces Clark (who is now aware of what he had done) to tears.I liked the DVD feature about Lois Lane over the years. Watching how an episode for this series is generated was also interesting. However, the production crew obviously fell down on their jobs during this season. Based on the poor `post-high school years' performance of past shows (90210, Buffy...etc) I really think that the studios needed to have cancelled Smallvile at the end of this season.",3,Somebody

Despite this, our main stars make up for what's lacking in the story with their emotional portrayals.  I loved all the scenes between Chloe and Clark....Lois and Clark...and the most memorable one...between Clark and Lana at school.  Tom Welling as Clark Kent portrays innocence and love for Kristin Kreuk's character, Lana, in the most heartbreaking way in this scene. That scene makes up for what is lacking in the main storyline.

I did enjoy the Christopher Reeves movies as a kid although I passed on the Dean Cain version as it seemed more like a chick flick but on TV. And nothing bothered me more than the idea of a whipped Superman. Then four years ago came Smallville or Superman - The High School Years. An interesting concept considering Lex Luther was not Clark Kent archenemies yet, nor had Kent don the tights yet. The episode drew a lot on the Buffy monster of the week philosophy but with a kryptonite twist.We left off the third season with Lex being poisoned, Lana leaving for Paris, Chloe being blown up, Pete has skipped town, Lionel was dieing from a bad liver and suddenly bald, and Clark disappeared with some naked hot chick. But of course no one really died and everything was back to normal by the third episode of the current season. Although Pete never came back and was replace instead was replace by Lana's boyfriend that she met in Paris. And yes, I hated him for that.The big news of the fourth season was that Lana was promoted from the Token Hot Chick of the show and actually had a decent storyline this year. Sadly this took her out of the running for the title of Hottest Token Hot Chick in the 1st annual Scooter Television Awards. So Lana apparently is the decent of a witch who decided to use Miss Lang to get back at the lineage that burned her at the stake. Luckily evil ancestor is successful and we get the greatest Smallville invention: evil Lana. For anyone who saw Eurotrip, you know how entertaining that can be. Evil Lana, like Clark, Lex, Lionel, Lana's new boyfriend and his mom, is after three stone that apparently do something.So with Lana dropping the title of token hot chick and no show is complete without one, so enter Lois Lane. A sassier version that the other LL's, but then again she is a teenager so I guess it makes sense. She was also a slight twist on the token hot chick in that she could kick my butt, and that only made her hotter. Smallville also brought in some other characters from the Superman lexicon including the Flash and Krypto the dog.Then by the end of the season, just like at the end of last season, everyone is in peril as another meteor shower has hit Smallville. And it looks like the stones everyone wanted transported Clark to what may become his Fortress of Solitude. Looking forward to next season, I assume it's safe to assume that everything will be back to normal by the start of the third episode. But when it comes down to it, hopefully we will get to see more of bad Lana.",4,I'm More Than a Man in a Silly Red Cape,1147478400,"05 13, 2006",2006,2824,"['So', 'somewhat', 'nerd', 'do', 'find', 'required', 'watch', 'Smallville', 'WB-ification', 'i.e', 'hot', 'moody', 'teenagers', 'greatest', 'superhero', 'ever', 'written', 'even', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'actually', 'own', 'comic', 'books', 'aside', 'few', 'Beavis', 'Butthead', 'one', 'picked', 'up', 'formative', 'years', 'did', 'enjoy', 'Christopher', 'Reeves', 'movies', 'kid', 'passed', 'Dean', 'Cain', 'version', 'seemed', 'more', 'chick', 'flick', 'TV', 'nothing', 'bothered', 'more', 'idea', 'whipped', 'Superman', 'Then', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'came', 'Smallville', 'Superman', 'High', 'School', 'Years', 'interesting', 'concept', 'considering', 'Lex', 'Luther', 'was', 'not', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'yet', 'had', 'Kent', 'tights', 'yet', 'episode', 'drew', 'lot', 'Buffy', 'monster', 'week', 'philosophy', 'kryptonite', 'twist.We', 'left', 'off', 'third', 'season', 'Lex', 'being', 'poisoned', 'Lana', 'leaving', 'Paris', 'Chloe', 'being', 'blown', 'up', 'Pete', 'skipped', 'town', 'Lionel', 'was', 'dieing', 'bad', 'liver', 'suddenly', 'bald', 'Clark', 'disappeared', 'naked', 'hot', 'chick', 'course', 'one', 'really', 'died', 'everything', 'was', 'back', 'normal', 'third', 'episode', 'current', 'season', 'Pete', 'never', 'came', 'back', 'was', 'replace', 'instead', 'was', 'replace', 'Lana', 'boyfriend', 'met', 'Paris', 'yes', 'hated', 'that.The', 'big', 'news', 'fourth', 'season', 'was', 'Lana', 'was', 'promoted', 'Token', 'Hot', 'Chick', 'show', 'actually', 'had', 'decent', 'storyline', 'year', 'Sadly', 'took', 'running', 'title', 'Hottest', 'Token', 'Hot', 'Chick', '1st', 'annual', 'Scooter', 'Television', 'Awards', 'So', 'Lana', 'apparently', 'decent', 'witch', 'who', 'decided', 'use', 'Miss', 'Lang', 'get', 'back', 'lineage', 'burned', 'stake', 'Luckily', 'evil', 'ancestor', 'successful', 'get', 'greatest', 'Smallville', 'invention', 'evil', 'Lana', 'anyone', 'who', 'saw', 'Eurotrip', 'know', 'how', 'entertaining', 'can', 'be', 'Evil', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'Lionel', 'Lana', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'mom', 'three', 'stone', 'apparently', 'do', 'something.So', 'Lana', 'dropping', 'title', 'token', 'hot', 'chick', 'show', 'complete', 'one', 'so', 'enter', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'A', 'sassier', 'version', 'other', 'LL', 'then', 'again', 'teenager', 'so', 'guess', 'sense', 'was', 'also', 'slight', 'twist', 'token', 'hot', 'chick', 'could', 'kick', 'butt', 'only', 'made', 'hotter', 'Smallville', 'also', 'brought', 'other', 'characters', 'Superman', 'lexicon', 'including', 'Flash', 'Krypto', 'dog.Then', 'end', 'season', 'just', 'end', 'last', 'season', 'everyone', 'peril', 'meteor', 'shower', 'hit', 'Smallville', 'stones', 'everyone', 'wanted', 'transported', 'Clark', 'what', 'may', 'become', 'Fortress', 'Solitude', 'Looking', 'forward', 'next', 'season', 'assume', 'safe', 'assume', 'everything', 'will', 'be', 'back', 'normal', 'start', 'third', 'episode', 'when', 'down', 'hopefully', 'will', 'get', 'see', 'more', 'bad', 'Lana']",N/A

We lost a lot of the interesting drama such as the Clark/Lex connections and Clark/Lana romance, and instead are given a couple new characters such as the incredibly annoying Lois Lane (who becomes slightly less annoying in later seasons) and yawn-inducing new love for Lana, Jason. Sam Jones, III (Pete Ross) left the show in Season 3 which left a void for Clark to bounce ideas off of.  As such, he is much more of a loner in this season.  The extended backstories this season were far-fetched (even for a show about a superhero) and not that interesting, especially the one involving Lana getting powers and turning into a witch or something. There were even a couple of really terrible episodes involving a super-dog and a super-baby.Most of these episodes deal with someone being possessed by something, usually involving kryptonite, and get old real fast. With the exception of a couple small events, you could pretty much skip this entire season and not miss much.The DVD set comprises 22 episodes on six discs.  Three of the episodes have commentary tracks (although Welling doesn't appear on any of them).  All three were fairly disappointing and I didn't gain much from them.Episode List:1. Crusade2. Gone3.

903157,A36QYTMMJ0O2IZ,B0009A5MUO,Sean Pasek,"[24, 33]","Seasons 1-3 are great, so it becomes hard to believe that Season 4 is even better as Smallville and its characters really hit their stride. Gough and Millar (writers and producers)continue their success of bringing Superman into the 21st century and updating him from the early 1930s to the present.  One of the problems of the 1930s Superman is that he has grown out of reach with the audience.  The biggest issue I've heard is that Superman is the hero everyone strives to be but you can't relate to him.  He doesn't seem to have the challenges and problems of the every-day man.  Clark Kent in Smallville does, and thus, we are finally able to relate to Clark Kent which is what we want.You may find it hard to believe that one of today's best actors is Tom Welling.  He has come so far as Clark Kent, and his acting is simply tremendous.  He is able to really show the complexities of Clark Kent's character, moreso than any other actor who has ever played the character.  It is pure joy to watch him in the episode, ""Transference"" when he and Lionel Luthor switch bodies.  We've seen Clark on red kryptonite, but Tom Welling acting as Lionel is really fun and demonstrates how broad his range has become.  Tom has also made some key changes and suggestions in a number of episodes which the directors have found to be very helpful.Also, another soon-to-be superhero visits Clark in Smallville.  And, no, it is not Bruce Wayne.  It is fun when this character non-chalantly suggests the forming of a ""club"" or a ""league"" some day.Lana Lang is finally brought into the Superman mythology rather than simply being an outside character.  Kristin Kreuk is also allowed to expand her acting abilities, and she does it very well.Chloe's character is finally softened quite a bit, and I feel that this is the first season where her character really becomes likeable.  She also discovers a secret and we see how broad her loyalty and friendship is.Lex's descent into darkness truly begins here in Season 4.  With Lionel in prison, he has all the power of Luthorcorp at his fingertips, and we find that he is unable to escape his obsessions, even if it means sacrificing friendships and relationships.  We sympathize with him as he battles himself to try not become his father.  We find Lex has developed feelings for a key character, and although he values his friendship with Clark, exactly what are Lex's motives?Two new additional characters are introduced in Season 4 by two exceptional actors.  The first, Erica Durance as Lois Lane.  In my opinion, she is the best Lois Lane I've yet seen portrayed.  She brings a real sauciness to Lois's character, and the banter between Clark and Lois provides some great laughs!  Gough and Millar scowered the Earth to find their ""Lois Lane"" and they hit the bullseye with Erica.  The second is Jensen Ackles as Jason Teague (Lana's new love interest).  I've already greatly admired his work from Dark Angel (X-5 Alec).  Believe it or not, he was actually the runner-up to play Clark Kent initially.Season 4 brings about some great stories:  Will Lana finally have a successful relationship with someone?  Or will she go 0-4?  Can Jonathan Kent stay out of the hospital?  Can Lionel Luthor have a change of heart?  How many times does Lex get pistol-whipped in this season?  And what are the three power crystals that Clark must acquire before they fall into human hands?  How does Clark deal with the loss of someone close to him?Season 4 ends with another major cliff-hanger.  A lot of veteran actors are making appearances on Smallville as they wish to be a part of this wonderful re-invention of one of America's biggest icons.  Margot Kidder and Jane Seymour are among them.The commentary episodes are a lot of fun to listen to, especially ""Spell"" which features commentary by Kristin Kreuk, Erica Durance, and Allison Mack.  Funny how they mention Tom Welling walking around the set mumbling, ""Clark is such an idiot!""Enjoy this 4th season as Smallville has not lost its stride!  In fact, Season 4 has some heart-felt moments that help to put this season at the top.

Give me a few changes, add a bit more meat onto the fledgling superman and have it escape the Dawson Creek like romance that has little or NO chemistry between Lana and Clark. I thought for sure it would pass since we all know Lois was Superman's true love.But alas the meat was very slow, steps forward in the plot like Lex's advancement to evil then took two steps backwards.  Lana remained the darling of the show no matter how much her character pouted and fretted.Then I rewatched Lois and Clark the first season and I realized why I had stopped looking forward to Wednesday night, the lack of creativity.  There is nothing wrong with young Clark, Lex and especially the cool addition of Chloe to the cast of characters but they HAVE TO LET characters grow.  When Clark decided once again to pursue Lana Lang I opted out of Wednesday night viewing frustrated.  How many characters have to fall in love with Lana, how many Kryponite mutants show up and fight, how many times does Kryponite have to make Clark double over in pain before the writers think of something new to do?One reviewer mentioned how they didn't know how much longer they could continue and I am sorry to say, it is all up to the writers.  In Lois and Clark Kryponite was an occassional plot point, while morals, the fear of discovery and his unwilliness to be God kept Clark challenged.  Smallville can do it to!  I challenge the writers of Season to 5 to use Kryponite just once this season.  I futher challenge them to have only 1 obsessed fan of Lana and finally give Cholie a chance to shine.And if you readers really want to see chemistry and character with Superman as the hero, check out the first season of Lois and Clark.",2,More Kryponite in smallville then corn,1120521600,"07 5, 2005",2005,1767,"['former', 'avid', 'watcher', 'Smallville', 'was', 'easy', 'please', 'Give', 'few', 'changes', 'add', 'bit', 'more', 'meat', 'fledgling', 'superman', 'have', 'Dawson', 'Creek', 'romance', 'little', 'NO', 'chemistry', 'Lana', 'Clark', 'thought', 'sure', 'would', 'pass', 'know', 'Lois', 'was', 'Superman', 'true', 'love.But', 'meat', 'was', 'very', 'slow', 'steps', 'forward', 'plot', 'Lex', 'advancement', 'evil', 'then', 'took', 'two', 'steps', 'backwards', 'Lana', 'remained', 'darling', 'show', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'character', 'pouted', 'fretted.Then', 'rewatched', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'first', 'season', 'realized', 'why', 'had', 'stopped', 'looking', 'forward', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'lack', 'creativity', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'young', 'Clark', 'Lex', 'especially', 'cool', 'addition', 'Chloe', 'cast', 'characters', 'HAVE', 'TO', 'LET', 'characters', 'grow', 'When', 'Clark', 'decided', 'once', 'again', 'pursue', 'Lana', 'Lang', 'opted', 'Wednesday', 'night', 'viewing', 'frustrated', 'How', 'many', 'characters', 'have', 'fall', 'love', 'Lana', 'how', 'many', 'Kryponite', 'mutants', 'show', 'up', 'fight', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'Kryponite', 'have', 'make', 'Clark', 'double', 'pain', 'writers', 'think', 'something', 'new', 'do', 'One', 'reviewer', 'mentioned', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'much', 'longer', 'could', 'continue', 'am', 'sorry', 'say', 'up', 'writers', 'Lois', 'Clark', 'Kryponite', 'was', 'occassional', 'plot', 'point', 'morals', 'fear', 'discovery', 'unwilliness', 'be', 'God', 'kept', 'Clark', 'challenged', 'Smallville', 'can', 'do', 'challenge', 'writers', 'Season', '5', 'use', 'Kryponite', 'just', 'once', 'season', 'futher', 'challenge', 'have', 'only', '1', 'obsessed', 'fan', 'Lana', 'finally', 'give', 'Cholie', 'chance', 'shine.And', 'readers', 'really', 'want', 'see', 'chemistry', 'character', 'Superman', 'hero', 'check', 'out', 'first', 'season', 'Lois', 'Clark']",N/A
903160,A2QQHIY23PL7H3,B0009A5MUO,Simon,"[28, 30]","As a huge Smallville fan, I'm very disappointed by season 4 thus far. Granted as I write this the finale has yet to air, but even if its a grand slam episode it can't shake off what has been multiple episodes of idiocy, absurdity, and contrivance.I've been watching my season 1 and 2 sets lately, and am amazed at how much depth and character interaction were in those early episodes. The kryptonite monsters sucked, but those episodes were held together by strong relationships that made Smallville feel real. Most of this is lost by season 4. This year, we get a storyline about kryptonian artifacts that Clark must recover. Not a bad idea, but somehow Lana has a witch ancestor trapped in her body who is also seeking the magic rocks. What was intended as a storyline to bring her closer into the mythology only pushes her farther away. I like Kristen Kruek, but she spends most of the season distrustful of Clark, Lex, her new boyfriend Jason, and just about everyone else. The sweetness we fell in love with only returns at the tail end of the season. What happened to Lana?In fact, what's happened to everyone else? The absurd storyline seems to give everyone nothing to do, which is odd considering the talented cast. An interesting twist with John Glover's Lionel Luthor is rendered moot by the season's end, and he and Michael Rosenbaum's Lex are wasted on the soap opera drama of the artifacts hunt. The Kent parents don't show up as much as they used to, and when they do they spout an endless string of cliched parental advice. Jensen Ackles is Jason Teague, the new disposable supporting character. I like him, and he's an asset to the show, but he's not given much to do. He would've fared a lot better as an actual boyfriend to Lana and not just another plot device in the artifacts storyline.So what does Smallville do right this year? Two words: Erica. Durance. Seriously, the addition of Lois Lane is eyebrow raising, but like the introduction of young Lex it pays off in spades. Erica becomes Clark's window for growth and development this year, and the chemistry between her and Tom Welling rocks. Also, Allison Mack's Chloe learns a bit more about Clark (finally!) and fan favourite Alicia Baker (the beautiful Sarah Carter) returns for a tragic two-part story mid-season.I could go on about the horrible dialogue, scripts with metor-sized plotholes and contrivances, or the butchering of Superman foe Mxyzptlk. However, in the end this is a show I've stayed with for four years, and it's been a constant and dependable diversion. I have all three of the previous sets, so it's hard to imagine not buying this one as well. I'm also going to stick with Smallville till the end, because we all want to see Clark finally accept his destiny.

903161,AAULAGYRQMRQ,B0009A5MUO,S. Nemati,"[1, 2]","Although still fun and entertaining, Season 4 was not the highlight of the series (as even the producers will tell you). The season took risks and went in different directions; some of which paid off and some of which did not.This was a season of Ying and Yang; Good and Evil and battling both sides. I am not a fan of the supernatural. I tend to be drawn to the science fiction elements of the show. As a result, I did not like the ongoing subplot with witches. Lana came back from Paris, a bit more mature and self righteous but also far less soft than she used to be. Her new romance fizzled pretty quickly and never seemed very well thought out. Also Lionel's battle with his two sides had most fans missing the more devious side.This season had some highlights though: Lois Lane has been a fun addition to the show even if her integration into it has been a bit rocky. Someone in Clark's life discovers his secret and their bond intensifies. The show, desperate to pull away from the darkness of season 3 (which I personally loved), added some lighter shows in the mix. For me, the more corny, funny episodes were entertaining and cute (including ""Devoted"" and ""Spirit""). The stones plot was sort of a mixed bag, but it cumulated into a very gripping, movie-like finale.

Having said that I love this show..mostly because I've been a die hard Superman fan since before I could walk. Me, my Dad, and my mom have enjoyed watching all three seasons together. I own all three seasons and plan on owning Season four. I can't wait til Clark is finally able to fly at will...he did in the first episode of Season four ..but then when he turned back to his normal self (watch season to learn what I'm talking about.) he has forgten that he can fly. I love Clark's refusle to being called Kal-El (his Birth name.) And I have to admit that I was abit upset about how they made Jor-El out to look like a bad guy..and I was really ticked off with the whole Kara (Superman's cusion a.k.a Supergirl in the comics) being a tool of Jor-El's to trick Clark into accepting his disteny. Other than that I'm pretty happy with the show. Espically with Chirsopter Reeve guest staring in episodes 17 of both Seasons two and three. Its a pitty that he died..cuz I would have loved to see more of him in the show. I also liked the appearances by Marrgot Kidder in two of the episodes in Season four. Not to mention the apparence of Perry White (future eidtor in cheif of the Daily Planet) in Season three. I'd love to see a guest apperance from Gene Hackman (Played Lex Luthor in the Superman movies with Chirstopher Reeve and Marrgot Kidder) in Season Five. I enjoed the appearnce of Lois Lane in this season..and their sibling like relationship through out the season...though how its going to work out when Clark bumps into her 12 years later in Metroplois is going to work excatly I'm not sure..but I turst it will be pulled off nicely. I also have to say that I loved the fact that they casted Annette O'Toole as Martha Kent..because she played Lana Lang in Superman 3. I don't know what others are complaining about the acting..I agree its a bit rough at times..but I don't think their all horriable actors. I missed the episode with Kyrpto though...but my dad told me that it turned out he was the result of Lionel enjecting Krpytonite into a dog...kind of hated that. In the comics Krypto was actually from Krypton. Jor-El used the young pup as a test to make sure that a living thing could survive the trip from Krypton to Earth. But oh well. I have a good feeling that Season five will be the final season. As long as the end the show with Clark ripping the shirt opening revialing the S and flying off to save some one. I'll be happy.

903166,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B0009A5MUO,Tom Benton,"[7, 12]","I love SMALLVILLE.  I have since Season One.  It seems to me that it's been decreasing in quality since its first season, though.  Season One was excellent.  Season Two was great through most of it, but the Clark-Lana relationship began getting a little ridiculous toward the end of the season.  Season Three got off to a fantastic start, but it had a very weak midsection.  With the infamous Season Four, SMALLVILLE hit rock bottom.  It's pretty lame television; there's poor acting, poor directing, poor photography, poor music, horrible writing ... I found myself thinking throughout the season, ""If you fail in the land of television, you join the crew of SMALLVILLE.""  I wasn't pleased to be thinking it, but I was.It's clear what the season's major problem was - creators/executive producers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar knew how they wanted the season to begin and end, but didn't know what to do in between.  Sure enough, the first five or so episodes of the season are wonderful, particularly the season premiere, which introduces the character of Lois Lane, played by Erica Durance.  That too, is one of the season's problems - Lois Lane.  Durance is an excellent choice for the role, but Lois should not be here.  It's problematic enough having Lex Luthor know Clark Kent as a teenager; having Clark Kent know Lois Lane, and - even worse - hate her, is going to take some incredible writing to fix up later.  This is just one of many ways that Gough and Millar have f****d up the Superman mythos; their biggest problem (why, guys, why?) is making Jor-El (voiced by Terence Stamp, who played General Zod in SUPERMAN II!) send Clark to Earth not to protect and guide its people, but to conquer the planet.  WHY?!As I've said, the writing is terrible.  The whole ""Kids in SMALLVILLE have been affected by kryptonite and are now mutated"" storyline was growing old by Season Three; it's really worn its welcome by Season Four.  The storylines for the episodes aren't always so bad; it's the dialogue that really catches the writers.  Also, the characters often feel one-dimensional and boring.  Clark becomes rather oafish, while Chloe deals out cringeworthy one-liners.  Lana becomes nothing short of a moron, thanks to some very weak acting from Kristin Kreuk (whom I loved in Season One).  I couldn't help thinking of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER throughout this season; how witty the dialogue was, how ingenious the storylines, how utterly flawless the show was.  But not SMALLVILLE.  How stunning this show could've been if someone with Joss Whedon's talent had had a hand in it.The acting does have its moments, like everything else.  Michael Rosenbaum is consistently good as Lex Luthor, and John Glover is, as always, fantastic.  Jane Seymour guest stars in numerous episodes of the season, and she is terrific.  Unfortunately, her character's storyline is rather silly.  The story for this season involves three ancient Kryptonian stones scattered across the world.  Reuniting them supposedly does something great.  Naturally, everyone's after the stones, including Clark, who is warned by Jor-El not to let the stones enter human hands.  There's a little subplot in there, however, about Lana Lang's ancestor being a witch who now takes to possessing Lana frequently.  It's very foolish.For all its faults, this season does have its share of good episodes.  Like I said, the first five or so episodes of the season are great, particularly the premiere, ""Crusade"".  ""Devoted"", in which Smallville High cheerleaders are spiking the football players' drinks with kryptonite to make them be more faithful, is very fun.  ""Run"", which introduces the character of The Flash, is good but not great.  ""Transference"", however, is great.  In the episode, Clark and Lionel Luthor switch bodies.  It's a very well-written and -directed episode.  ""Spell"" is the most notorious episode in the show's history, in which Lana, Chloe and Lois are possessed by the spirits of three ancient witches.  ""Unsane"" and ""Pariah"" feature the return of Alicia (from last season's ""Obsession""); they're both very good episodes.  ""Onyx"" is one of the season's best episode, in which Lex is split into two parts by black kryptonite - Good Lex and Evil Lex.  ""Blank"" is the series' inevitable memory loss episode, and it's surprisingly good.  The WB apparently decided to cash in on the semi-success of Warner Bros. remake of HOUSE OF WAX by making an episode in which a Smallville student creates a replica of the high school complete with students; that episode is titled ""Forever"" and would actually be quite good if it wasn't for the whole wax storyline.  The real reason to buy the season is the finale: ""Commencement"", a stunning 50-minute episode filled with explosions, revelations, and cliffhangers galore.  It's quite possibly the best episode of the series yet.Was I happy with SMALLVILLE Season Four?  No.  I was disappointed to the point of tears.  I love this show, but what had it become?  A joke, weak in every aspect.  However, I know that some people enjoyed this season, and it does have a number of fine episodes.

In the past it was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Popular, & Felicity.  In the past few years (my high school years) it was Everwood & Smallville.  But both of those shows started to go jurasically downhill in the 2003/2004 television season.  I stoped watching Smallville during Season 3.  But durring the summer of 2004 the tv promos promising the appearance of Lois Lane made me tune into the season premier, and from there I was hooked.This season of Smallville is in my opinion, the best one yet.  Not only does the introduction of Lois Lane add a factor to the show that hasn't been explored before but for the first time the characters really click (especially due to the fact of Lionel's downgraded stasus (he was only in 10 episodes).  Episodes like Spell while on the surface don't do much to the overall arc of the season, add a fun, fluffy element to the show that was missing in seasons 2 & 3.There is a fair share of mythology episodes in this season, but all of them are leading up to something bigger.  For the first time the writers and producers are prepping Clark for college and his future life at the Daily Planet.  It is really interesting watching Season 4 of Smallville and Season 1 of ""Lois and Clark"" at the same time.  If the show is given another four years or so, I think that this will probably be one of the most comprehensive Superman legends!

I mean you can only have the love interest tension and battling the freak of the week for so long before it all becomes campy.  One of the primary differences in this season compared to the previous seasons is that the main story line become more prevalant instead of a continous back story as before.The reincarnation of Lana's ancient witch ancestor through Lana was a bit strange.

903171,AP3B615GM191G,B0009A5MUO,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[0, 0]","In the beginning (seasons 1-3), the concept of Smallville was to chronicle a young Clark Kent through his high school years.  After three seasons, however, the character relationships (especially Clark and Lana) that provided the emotional punch to the show became played out.  The ""on again, off again"" Clark/Lana saga was getting a bit old, the evilness of Lionel Luthor was well established, while the inner workings of Lex Luthor's tortured psyche continued to become apparent.  Barring a major change, the show looked like it may have been reaching a climax, what with the main characters graduating high school.  Yet, as is often a ""problem"" in televised drama, the show was so popular on its WB (now CW) network that it would surely continue for future change.  Thus, major change to the structure of the show is exactly what happened.  Let's start with the not-so-great changes (trying not to reveal too many spoilers!) and end on the high notes:For the first time, the writers/producers constructed a season-long dramatic arc in which Lana (controlled by an ancient medieval witch, as improbably as that may sound), Lex, and Clark race to obtain three Kryptonian stones.  Needless to say, this storyline was quite contrived (most likely to give Kristin Kruek (Lana) something to portray) and lacked the punch of the Kryptonian caves or Lex's insanity of earlier seasons.  Thus, the ""mythology"" episodes of this season were subpar.The other disappointing aspect of Season Four was the introduction of Lois Lane.  Though (obviously) an extremely important part of Clark's future, the Lois character struggles to fit into the overall scheme of the show.  My personal theory is that she was added to spice up the show's sex appeal (one look at Erica Durance (Lois) will show you why) to appeal to the young WB audience.Besides those major gaffes, however, Smallville's fourth season provided a number of fantastic moments that kept its fans (young and old alike) tuning in each week:-The ""no flights"" rule is temporary lifted in the season premiere.-Clark is introduced to a certain ""speedster"" with whom he will later pair with.-An incredible acting performance from Tom Welling (Clark) after switching bodies with Lionel Luthor.-A mischevious Russian villian is introduced who continues to torment Clark long into the future.-Alicia Baker (Clark's former love) is brought back in a very emotional two-part series.-The Kent family comes across a later-famous pooch with certain ""abilities"".-Perhaps the best acting performance from Michael Rosenbaum (Lex) in which his ""good"" and ""evil"" sides square off against each other (ala Captain Kirk in Star Trek).-The final scene of the season, which introduces a critically important piece of Clark Kent's future.To conclude, the fourth season of Smallville lacked the emotional focus of the three preceding seasons, but still managed enough ""wow"" moments to continue satisfying the ""shipper"" (relationship-based) and die-hard comic book Smallville fans alike.",4,"Lost Focus A Bit But Still ""Super"" Television",1211760000,"05 26, 2008",2008,3009,"['beginning', 'seasons', '1-3', 'concept', 'Smallville', 'was', 'chronicle', 'young', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'high', 'school', 'years', 'three', 'seasons', 'however', 'character', 'relationships', 'especially', 'Clark', 'Lana', 'provided', 'emotional', 'punch', 'show', 'became', 'played', 'out', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'Clark/Lana', 'saga', 'was', 'getting', 'bit', 'old', 'evilness', 'Lionel', 'Luthor', 'was', 'well', 'established', 'inner', 'workings', 'Lex', 'Luthor', 'tortured', 'psyche', 'continued', 'become', 'apparent', 'Barring', 'major', 'change', 'show', 'looked', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'reaching', 'climax', 'what', 'main', 'characters', 'graduating', 'high', 'school', 'often', 'problem', 'televised', 'drama', 'show', 'was', 'so', 'popular', 'WB', 'now', 'CW', 'network', 'would', 'surely', 'continue', 'future', 'change', 'Thus', 'major', 'change', 'structure', 'show', 'exactly', 'what', 'happened', 'Let', 'start', 'not-so-great', 'changes', 'trying', 'not', 'reveal', 'too', 'many', 'spoilers', 'end', 'high', 'notes', 'first', 'time', 'writers/producers', 'constructed', 'season-long', 'dramatic', 'arc', 'Lana', 'controlled', 'ancient', 'medieval', 'witch', 'as', 'improbably', 'may', 'sound', 'Lex', 'Clark', 'race', 'obtain', 'three', 'Kryptonian', 'stones', 'Needless', 'say', 'storyline', 'was', 'quite', 'contrived', 'most', 'likely', 'give', 'Kristin', 'Kruek', 'Lana', 'something', 'portray', 'lacked', 'punch', 'Kryptonian', 'Lex', 'insanity', 'earlier', 'seasons', 'Thus', 'mythology', 'episodes', 'season', 'were', 'subpar.The', 'other', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'Season', 'Four', 'was', 'introduction', 'Lois', 'Lane', 'Though', 'obviously', 'extremely', 'important', 'part', 'Clark', 'future', 'Lois', 'character', 'fit', 'overall', 'scheme', 'show', 'personal', 'theory', 'was', 'added', 'spice', 'up', 'show', 'sex', 'appeal', 'one', 'look', 'Erica', 'Durance', 'Lois', 'will', 'show', 'why', 'appeal', 'young', 'WB', 'major', 'gaffes', 'however', 'Smallville', 'fourth', 'season', 'provided', 'number', 'fantastic', 'moments', 'kept', 'fans', 'young', 'old', 'alike', 'tuning', 'week', '-The', 'flights', 'rule', 'temporary', 'lifted', 'season', 'premiere.-Clark', 'introduced', 'certain', 'speedster', 'whom', 'will', 'later', 'pair', 'with.-An', 'incredible', 'acting', 'performance', 'Tom', 'Welling', 'Clark', 'switching', 'bodies', 'Lionel', 'Luthor.-A', 'mischevious', 'Russian', 'villian', 'introduced', 'who', 'torment', 'Clark', 'long', 'future.-Alicia', 'Baker', 'Clark', 'former', 'love', 'brought', 'back', 'very', 'emotional', 'two-part', 'series.-The', 'Kent', 'family', 'later-famous', 'pooch', 'certain', 'abilities', '.-Perhaps', 'best', 'acting', 'performance', 'Michael', 'Rosenbaum', 'Lex', 'good', 'evil', 'sides', 'square', 'other', 'ala', 'Captain', 'Kirk', 'Star', 'Trek', '.-The', 'final', 'scene', 'season', 'critically', 'important', 'piece', 'Clark', 'Kent', 'future.To', 'conclude', 'fourth', 'season', 'Smallville', 'lacked', 'emotional', 'focus', 'three', 'preceding', 'seasons', 'still', 'managed', 'enough', 'wow', 'moments', 'continue', 'satisfying', 'shipper', 'relationship-based', 'die-hard', 'comic', 'book', 'Smallville', 'fans', 'alike']",N/A
