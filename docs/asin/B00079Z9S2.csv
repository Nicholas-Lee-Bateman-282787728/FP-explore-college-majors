The acting is horrible, the scenery is cheap (it was shot on the Cheney University campus about 5 miles from me) and the ending is perposterous. I was hoping, after reading al the five star reviews, that this was a decent indie release but it's not. It looks like it was filmed on some guys hand held video camera. Do not recommend you waste your money on this one, sorry.",1,What move were all these people watching?,1143504000,"03 28, 2006",2006,471,"['rented', 'movie', 'i', 'liked', 'Wood', 'Harris', ""'Paid"", 'Full', 'Boy', 'was', 'disappointed', 'acting', 'horrible', 'scenery', 'cheap', 'was', 'shot', 'Cheney', 'University', 'campus', '5', 'miles', 'ending', 'perposterous', 'was', 'hoping', 'reading', 'five', 'star', 'reviews', 'was', 'decent', 'indie', 'release', 'not', 'was', 'filmed', 'guys', 'hand', 'held', 'video', 'camera', 'Do', 'not', 'recommend', 'waste', 'money', 'one', 'sorry']",N/A

Like the other reviewer said, I don't know what film the others were watching. I gave it 2 stars because the basic screenplay idea (NOT the screenplay itself) was a good one, and the subject matter was important. The execution of the film itself, however, was very amateurish. The camera work was poor, and the majority of the acting... well, there's no other way to say it; it was truly bad. Almost everyone overacted to the point of laughability, and the dialogue sounded forced and trite. MC Lyte's performance may have been good for a rapper who never acted, but that didn't make it good altogether. Rolle, obviously really sick when this was made, just went through the motions and read her lines, which again, were so overeactive they bordered on ridiculous. Shame such a distinguished actress had such a lame swan song. And the ending was completely unrealistic. The film also may hold the Guinness record for the most times ""man"" was said in a movie. Finally, there were several glaring plot holes. For one, NOT that Trina deserved or asked for what happened to her, but why would she stay alone with essentially three strangers who had been drinking when her two friends were leaving? And why wouldn't her friends insist she come with them? Save your time and money on thsi one.
