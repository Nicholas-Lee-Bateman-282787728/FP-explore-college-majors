1067687,AT2ONGBAQ8HFD,B000P0HBC0,Ema Nnep,"[1, 1]","I'm a fan of action, sci-fi and horror movies and this franchise offers plenty of that.I love the original Predator with Ahnold, it's an awesome, awesome movie from start to finish and I very much enjoyed the 3rd installment, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, the tie in with the Alien francise was great and the creepiness of finding an ancient temple ruin in the middle of one of the polar ice caps so that the two species can go at it...  Well, an interesting and inventive twist to the story.On the other hand, I only gave the set a 4 star rating because of Predator 2 with Danny Glover.  It was a hideously bad sequel that had a moment or two of humor and only the last five minutes had any interest at all.  It was worse than a B movie, it was a D- and it had no resemblance whatsoever to the caliber of movie the first and third were.They were created for entertaining an audience with an interesting storyline and action.  Predator 2 was made for a tax write off.Still, if you're interested in putting together a movie marathon, this is definitely a set worth getting, even if Predator 2 is a 90 minute gag reel.",4,Great set!,1318204800,"10 10, 2011",2011,1111,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'action', 'sci-fi', 'horror', 'movies', 'franchise', 'plenty', 'that.I', 'original', 'Predator', 'Ahnold', 'awesome', 'awesome', 'movie', 'start', 'finish', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', '3rd', 'installment', 'AVP', 'Alien', 'vs', 'Predator', 'tie', 'Alien', 'francise', 'was', 'great', 'creepiness', 'finding', 'ancient', 'temple', 'ruin', 'middle', 'one', 'polar', 'ice', 'caps', 'two', 'species', 'can', 'go', 'Well', 'interesting', 'inventive', 'twist', 'story.On', 'other', 'hand', 'only', 'gave', 'set', '4', 'star', 'rating', 'Predator', '2', 'Danny', 'Glover', 'was', 'hideously', 'bad', 'sequel', 'had', 'moment', 'two', 'humor', 'only', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'had', 'interest', 'was', 'worse', 'B', 'movie', 'was', 'D-', 'had', 'resemblance', 'whatsoever', 'caliber', 'movie', 'first', 'third', 'were.They', 'were', 'created', 'entertaining', 'audience', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'action', 'Predator', '2', 'was', 'made', 'tax', 'write', 'off.Still', ""'re"", 'interested', 'putting', 'together', 'movie', 'marathon', 'definitely', 'set', 'worth', 'getting', 'even', 'Predator', '2', '90', 'minute', 'gag', 'reel']",N/A

Back to the review like I said Predator 2 Danny Glovers charactergreat Maria Conchita Alanso strong female character Bill Paxton not only was killed by an Alien in Aliens he gets killed by a Predator he acted very well in both films of course Gary Buesy was just Gary Buesy you know but he was still better than the characters in Alien vs Predator. Kevin Peter Hall RIP very very awesome as the Predator but these guys as the Predators sucked when they were running in costume that's not designed for that they decided to put it in slow mo it looked like Baywatch I loled at that. The score was forgettable Alien, Aliens, Alien 3 & yes even Alien Resurrections soundtracks were better Alan Silvestri great score.

1067695,A220FJEQNGMSRN,B000P0HBC0,Trevor Willsmer,"[0, 0]","Predator still holds up remarkably well as one of the best 80s action movies, directed with real panache and craftsmanship by John McTiernan before he was led onto the rocks by the sirencall of bad remakes of Norman Jewison films. For all the macho posturing and outrageous dialog of the first half (""I ain't got time to bleed""), once the hunt is on and the stakes are raised, he takes it deadly seriously and delivers the best jungle manhunt since Merian C. Cooper thought of another use for those jungle sets built for his monkey movie.Predator 2 is a lot better than I remembered, although a long way from being as good as the original. Although the ripoffs of Wolfen are even more pronounced here than in the original, it enlarges on the predator mythology and manages to come up with an interesting Schwarz-free premise for a sequel that occasionally pays dividends. Unfortunately Stephen Hopkins is no McTiernan, botching the most promising setpiece aboard a runaway subway train and failing to get the most out of a warehouse sequence, although the finale in the Predator's spaceship is well handled and he does throw in one neat piece of editing when Calvin Lockhart's hammy rasta villain meets the rasta from another planet.I've never understood the tidal waves of sci-fi fanboy revulsion for Paul W.S. Anderson, who's always seemed a competent if unambitious journeyman who'd have to die and be born again at least twice to make the bottom 250 directors working today, let alone the bottom three. Given the no-win situation with the fans of both franchises that was Alien Vs. Predator (an international co-production between every country that offers decent tax breaks) he delivers an okay entry in a franchise that has always underachieved more often than it succeeded. While some scenes are nowhere near as effective as they should be, the Antarctic setting makes a nice change from Sigourney Weaver running around yet another spaceship and it has a few good ideas even if surprises are thin on the ground. No excuses for Colin Salmon's truly awful performance, though, nor the non-ironic use of deadmeat characters talking about their children at home, but an enjoyable enough monster mash.",4,If you've got some time to kill...,1203206400,"02 17, 2008",2008,2203,"['Predator', 'still', 'up', 'remarkably', 'well', 'one', 'best', '80s', 'action', 'movies', 'directed', 'real', 'panache', 'craftsmanship', 'John', 'McTiernan', 'was', 'led', 'rocks', 'sirencall', 'bad', 'remakes', 'Norman', 'Jewison', 'films', 'macho', 'posturing', 'outrageous', 'dialog', 'first', 'half', 'ai', ""n't"", 'got', 'time', 'bleed', 'once', 'hunt', 'stakes', 'are', 'raised', 'deadly', 'seriously', 'best', 'jungle', 'manhunt', 'Merian', 'C.', 'Cooper', 'thought', 'use', 'jungle', 'sets', 'built', 'monkey', 'movie.Predator', '2', 'lot', 'better', 'remembered', 'long', 'way', 'being', 'as', 'good', 'original', 'ripoffs', 'Wolfen', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'pronounced', 'here', 'original', 'predator', 'mythology', 'come', 'up', 'interesting', 'Schwarz-free', 'premise', 'sequel', 'occasionally', 'dividends', 'Unfortunately', 'Stephen', 'Hopkins', 'McTiernan', 'botching', 'most', 'promising', 'setpiece', 'runaway', 'subway', 'train', 'failing', 'get', 'most', 'warehouse', 'sequence', 'finale', 'Predator', 'spaceship', 'well', 'handled', 'throw', 'one', 'neat', 'piece', 'editing', 'when', 'Calvin', 'Lockhart', 'hammy', 'rasta', 'villain', 'rasta', 'planet.I', ""'ve"", 'never', 'understood', 'tidal', 'waves', 'sci-fi', 'fanboy', 'revulsion', 'Paul', 'W.S', 'Anderson', 'who', 'always', 'seemed', 'competent', 'unambitious', 'journeyman', 'who', ""'d"", 'have', 'die', 'be', 'born', 'again', 'least', 'twice', 'make', 'bottom', '250', 'directors', 'working', 'today', 'let', 'alone', 'bottom', 'three', 'Given', 'no-win', 'situation', 'fans', 'franchises', 'was', 'Alien', 'Vs', 'Predator', 'international', 'co-production', 'country', 'decent', 'tax', 'breaks', 'okay', 'entry', 'franchise', 'always', 'underachieved', 'more', 'often', 'succeeded', 'scenes', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'effective', 'should', 'be', 'Antarctic', 'setting', 'nice', 'change', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'running', 'around', 'yet', 'spaceship', 'few', 'good', 'ideas', 'even', 'surprises', 'are', 'thin', 'ground', 'Colin', 'Salmon', 'truly', 'awful', 'performance', 'though', 'non-ironic', 'use', 'deadmeat', 'characters', 'talking', 'children', 'home', 'enjoyable', 'enough', 'monster', 'mash']",N/A
