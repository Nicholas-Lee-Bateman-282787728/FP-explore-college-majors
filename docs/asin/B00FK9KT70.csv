He has an expensive car, lives in a mansion, and doesn't appear to have employment that would bring in that kind of money. This is a movie that is quite emotional, spiritual, and shows the value of family and friends. It illustrates the power of prayer during a time when a miracle needed to occur. It is a story of redemption, forgiveness, love , understanding, and a man's journey to find God and a faith based life. It is a story about letting go so God can make things happen in your life.Vanessa was the catalyst for Miles to have his life changing experiences and opportunities.

And after he does, what, she lets him in her pants?

As a &#34;Christian&#34; women you don't date a man of the world, and then try to convert him. That's up to God. She should've waited a bit longer to see his stance and if he wants to pursue God.Ok. You're saved and you go to clubs?! No, I can't understand that one. Also, what church has provocatively dressed women like that attending? How are men suppose to focus on the message. Women are to be beautiful and feminine, I get that, but this is wardrobe for the bedroom only.For me it's not a complete 5, because I just can't get past the idea of Christians thinking it's ok to represent yourself to the world and do the &#34;dating&#34; scene backwards. No, women please wait for the man to surrender himself to God first or you will have huge fights in your marriage. Alot of &#34;Christian&#34; women think they can change a man, but it very so often works that way.2 Cor. 6:14 The bible says to not be yoked with unbelievers (in the first place)1 Tim- Women dress modestly (wow, not quite with this movie)I think it presents God in a fashion where he is an accepting all -powerful God, and rightly so, but please be careful to understand that Christian/Disciple women are suppose to present themselves in a way where they can be an example by their demeanor and by the way they are dressed. She had a smile on her face when he went to chug down some liquor- why?Fix your eyes on Yeshu'a (Jesus), the author and perfecter of our faith (Heb. 12).Men -You have to be very careful to look away at many of the women.This review is biblically based 1 Tim talks about the bible being used for rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.

With cameos by TobyMac and Jerry Rice, it's a must-see movie if you are looking for a family-friendly movie with a Christian theme.  The acting isn't professional on every level, but it isn't bad either.
