574921,A2Z7H3CN0OHOR1,B000059TP2,"Clara ""Maeve Binchy fan""","[1, 2]","I didn't pay attention to the other reviews of this DVD and decided to try it.  Bad Idea!!!!  It is so unlike the book as to be laughable.  Jack Figg wasn't even in the first series of Emma Harte novels.  Philip Amory never had anything to do with the stores, and Sandy was the head of Harte Enterprises and wouldn't have been gambling in Hong Kong.  Shane never resented Paula's work in the book.  The DVD never mentions Paula's first twins.  Where did they go since their father had died?  What happened to Linnett, Paula's younger daughter?  Lindsay Wagner as a red haired Brit is a disgrace.  Her British accent comes and goes.  I can see why Barbara Taylor Bradford introduces this DVD.  It needed all the help it could get.Please pay attention to this review and DON'T waste your money on this DVD.",1,Bad DVD,1224028800,"10 15, 2008",2008,804,"['did', ""n't"", 'pay', 'attention', 'other', 'reviews', 'DVD', 'decided', 'try', 'Bad', 'Idea', 'so', 'book', 'be', 'laughable', 'Jack', 'Figg', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'first', 'series', 'Emma', 'Harte', 'novels', 'Philip', 'Amory', 'never', 'had', 'anything', 'do', 'stores', 'Sandy', 'was', 'head', 'Harte', 'Enterprises', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'gambling', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'Shane', 'never', 'resented', 'Paula', 'work', 'book', 'DVD', 'never', 'Paula', 'first', 'twins', 'Where', 'did', 'go', 'father', 'had', 'died', 'What', 'happened', 'Linnett', 'Paula', 'younger', 'daughter', 'Lindsay', 'Wagner', 'red', 'haired', 'Brit', 'disgrace', 'British', 'accent', 'can', 'see', 'why', 'Barbara', 'Taylor', 'Bradford', 'DVD', 'needed', 'help', 'could', 'get.Please', 'pay', 'attention', 'review', 'DO', ""N'T"", 'waste', 'money', 'DVD']",N/A

Lindsey Wagner went in and out of the English Accent so often that it drew away from the story and caused me to wonder was she supposed to be American or English or both.

574928,A3A9BYE27J2LVV,B000059TP2,"Marie L. ""Avid reader, history buff, mom, pro...","[1, 2]","There's good book adaptations and bad. The good let the book speak; the great let the book shine.Bad adaptations happen when someone tries to improve on the author's work, or marries a bad adaptation to bad casting. 'To be the Best' isn't great literature, but it is a good story, and it deserves better than this shallow, pretentious blend of bad casting, altered characters and distorted story-lines.The lousy casting and warped characters crack this adaptation, and the altered story-lines sink it, even if you've never read the books or watched the first two installments. The total change in casting could work, but even the 'Bionic Woman' can't rescue this atrocity.  ""TBTB"" tries to explain British business woman Paula's very American accent by rewriting Paula's life-story, soap opera style. Despite being the third installment in the Emma/Paula story, Paula suddenly was raised in the US! Never noticed that in episodes 1 & 2! Paula's two children from her first marriage have disappeared (maybe she's sent them to American boarding school?). Husband Shane, who in books and adaptations so far was strong, confident and totally supportive of Paula's position as corporate CEO has morphed into a whiny, clingy neanderthal right out of the 1950s. Sometime he sounds like an aggreaved wife out of the '50s: he's constantly dragging their son around like exhibit 'A' complaining, ""You don't spend any time with us!""  He demands Paula give up being CEO of Harte's, and stomps about like a toddler in a tantrum. It might work if there was any chemistry, but there's not - not so much as a grade school science fair. (for those who've read or watched the first two installments, you'll understand that Shane here might as well be Jim Farley towards the end of 'Hold the Dream'.)The story sinks further under the weight of characters turned into caricatures of villains. Paula's cousin and nemesis might as well have a mustache to twirl, and all his Asian side-kick needed was a maniacal cackle to be right out of bad-guy central casting. Throw in the innocent temptress who isn't at all what she seems... it's all so predictable, and so not ""To Be the Best"".The bright surprise is Anthony Hopkins' 'Mr. Figg', head of security.  He's almost James Bond-ian, cocky, confident, exuding manliness, and he exudes it in Paula's direction. No wonder -it leads to an almost tryst between Figg and Paula -and Shane's such a wanker you're almost cheering them on! But in the end, Paula stays with Shane, defeats her nemesis/cousin with her head held high, not an easy task with her hair teased into a cross between a brillo pad and a bird's nest complete with a huge velvet watszit screwed into the base of the brillo nest. (Did I mention the costumes are escapees from the 80s?) Wrap all this up in jerky cinematography and bad dialogue and there's really no reason to waste your time on 'To Be the Best'. It just isn't the best use of anyone's time.",1,"A good story marred  by making characters into caricatures, silly changes and someone's hubris",1368144000,"05 10, 2013",2013,2944,"['good', 'book', 'adaptations', 'bad', 'good', 'let', 'book', 'speak', 'great', 'let', 'book', 'shine.Bad', 'adaptations', 'happen', 'when', 'someone', 'improve', 'author', 'work', 'bad', 'adaptation', 'bad', 'casting', 'be', 'Best', ""n't"", 'great', 'literature', 'good', 'story', 'better', 'shallow', 'pretentious', 'blend', 'bad', 'casting', 'altered', 'characters', 'distorted', 'story-lines.The', 'lousy', 'casting', 'warped', 'characters', 'crack', 'adaptation', 'altered', 'story-lines', 'sink', 'even', ""'ve"", 'never', 'read', 'books', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'installments', 'total', 'change', 'casting', 'could', 'work', 'even', ""'Bionic"", 'Woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'rescue', 'atrocity', 'TBTB', 'explain', 'British', 'business', 'woman', 'Paula', 'very', 'American', 'accent', 'rewriting', 'Paula', 'life-story', 'soap', 'opera', 'style', 'being', 'third', 'installment', 'Emma/Paula', 'story', 'Paula', 'suddenly', 'was', 'raised', 'US', 'Never', 'noticed', 'episodes', '1', '2', 'Paula', 'two', 'children', 'first', 'marriage', 'have', 'disappeared', 'maybe', 'sent', 'American', 'boarding', 'school', 'Husband', 'Shane', 'who', 'books', 'adaptations', 'so', 'far', 'was', 'strong', 'confident', 'totally', 'supportive', 'Paula', 'position', 'corporate', 'CEO', 'morphed', 'whiny', 'clingy', 'neanderthal', 'right', '1950s', 'Sometime', 'aggreaved', 'wife', ""'50s"", 'constantly', 'dragging', 'son', 'exhibit', 'A', 'complaining', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'time', 'Paula', 'give', 'up', 'being', 'CEO', 'Harte', 'stomps', 'toddler', 'tantrum', 'might', 'work', 'was', 'chemistry', 'not', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'grade', 'school', 'science', 'fair', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'watched', 'first', 'two', 'installments', ""'ll"", 'understand', 'Shane', 'here', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'Jim', 'Farley', 'end', 'Dream', 'story', 'further', 'weight', 'characters', 'turned', 'caricatures', 'villains', 'Paula', 'cousin', 'nemesis', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'have', 'mustache', 'twirl', 'Asian', 'side-kick', 'needed', 'was', 'maniacal', 'cackle', 'be', 'right', 'bad-guy', 'central', 'casting', 'Throw', 'innocent', 'temptress', 'who', ""n't"", 'what', 'so', 'predictable', 'so', 'not', 'Be', 'Best', '.The', 'bright', 'surprise', 'Anthony', 'Hopkins', ""'Mr"", 'Figg', 'head', 'security', 'almost', 'James', 'Bond-ian', 'cocky', 'confident', 'exuding', 'manliness', 'Paula', 'direction', 'wonder', '-it', 'almost', 'tryst', 'Figg', 'Paula', '-and', 'Shane', 'such', 'wanker', ""'re"", 'almost', 'cheering', 'end', 'Paula', 'Shane', 'nemesis/cousin', 'head', 'held', 'high', 'not', 'easy', 'task', 'hair', 'teased', 'cross', 'brillo', 'pad', 'bird', 'nest', 'complete', 'huge', 'velvet', 'watszit', 'screwed', 'base', 'brillo', 'nest', 'Did', 'mention', 'costumes', 'are', 'escapees', '80s', 'up', 'jerky', 'cinematography', 'bad', 'dialogue', 'really', 'reason', 'waste', 'time', 'Be', 'Best', 'just', ""n't"", 'best', 'use', 'anyone', 'time']",N/A
