Big parts of information were left out until the end and it was hard to feel the emotion needed to really get in touch with the film. The acting seemed too artificial probably because the characters had not really gotten to play opposite one another very often except for Melanie's and Patrick's characters. It just didn't allow your feelings to build and grow. It just went from one conflict to another, until it just seemed to far-fetched. I really do like all the actors, Melanie Griffith, Patrick Swayze, even the young boy who played their son, loved him in Sweet Jane!

674090,A2R4XG0L7Z01V8,B00005QAP7,"Meesha ""I'm A Lonely Angel Stuck On The Slow ...","[5, 7]","Ben (Patrick Swayze) and Lulu (Melanie Griffith) start this film off, knowing the lines to an old film, called ""The Hustler"", and you know, even if you haven't read the blurb, that there's a connection between them. Lulu is an innocent and childlike schizophrenic, and Ben plays an ex boyfriend, who left her when her illness was really bad, and is now married, wary about seeing Lulu again when she makes contact.Melanie looks really pretty in this film, and throughout you can see she's had some plastic surgery done. The thing that puts me off Lulu's character in this film is her constant smoking.Patrick still has the same physique that he did in ""Dirty Dancing""; even if the face has a few more lines. There's also a scene, where he does a raunchy dance routine with Melanie, very reminiscent of the clay scene in ""Ghost"". During this scene, you can see the chemistry that once was, and watch it resurface between Ben &amp; Lulu.  Some of Lulu rubs off on Ben, and he changes completely during the course of the film.Penelope Ann Millar plays Ben's wife Claire, a psychiatrist, who's very insecure about her husband's relationship with his ex. She chases him across the country, trying to save her ""disintegrating"" marriage, and does something she later comes to regret.  It's obvious by the way Ben &amp; Claire act around each other, that their marriage has been over for a long time, although what I thought was going to happen, doesn't. Claire &amp; Lulu's first meeting quickly descends into a slanging match, although not a catfight, which I was hoping for! The two women who are both in love with the same man, tell each other a few home truths, and Lulu gets them to open up to each other, which they haven't done in a long time. This scene is really emotional, and even the most cold hearted person will shed a tear.Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a small role towards the end of this, and is the reason Lulu gets back in contact with Ben - he's their son. He's 16, so they decide it should be time they saw him. Bad idea. The meeting goes from bad to worse, and the scene is full of tension. It makes the viewer feel very awkward, just watching the exchanges, you really feel sorry for Lulu and Ben. As Ben says, it's really hard to walk into your child's life after 16 years. I really liked Joseph in ""10 Things I Hate About You"", but in this film, I couldn't stand his character.Being a TV movie, this has a very bad soundtrack, and the music is intrusive at the best of times.Lulu appears full frontal in one scene, before diving into a swimming pool. It's a far away shot, but I saw too much for my liking. She still has a good figure, for her age though. She does remind me a lot of Angelina Jolie's character in ""Girl, Interrupted"". They play very similar characters and they even act the same way in certain scenes, although Angelina's character had a bit more of an edge.There are a few flashbacks during this film, with overly loud music, and they appear unannounced, so it can get confusing.This film, I thought, could have showed more about Lulu's schizophrenia, rather than just the odd bits that they do show - her hating loud noise etc. If you didn't know much about the characteristics of schizophrenia, then you wouldn't have necessarily known that Lulu was, apart from the note that comes along the bottom at the beginning of the film. I was half expecting to see schizophrenics shown in a bad light, but Lulu was portrayed really well.I did expect this film to end on a sad note, but I was pleasantly surprised it didn't. I was saying to myself towards the end, that they're not going to show what happens, but they show you what has happened to the characters 18 months on. Which I really enjoyed. You often find yourself wanting more from a film, wanting to find out what happened to the characters and you end up disappointed. The end song, ""Say Goodbye"" by Lauren Kinkade, ends the movie brilliantly, and is such a sad song! It makes the ending really sad, although it's a happy ending.",4,&#65533;You&#65533;re a very strange chick.&#65533; &#65533;You have no idea.&#65533;,1062288000,"08 31, 2003",2003,4017,"['Ben', 'Patrick', 'Swayze', 'Lulu', 'Melanie', 'Griffith', 'start', 'film', 'knowing', 'lines', 'old', 'film', 'called', 'Hustler', 'know', 'even', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'blurb', 'connection', 'Lulu', 'innocent', 'childlike', 'schizophrenic', 'Ben', 'ex', 'boyfriend', 'who', 'left', 'when', 'illness', 'was', 'really', 'bad', 'now', 'married', 'wary', 'seeing', 'Lulu', 'again', 'when', 'contact.Melanie', 'looks', 'really', 'pretty', 'film', 'can', 'see', 'had', 'plastic', 'surgery', 'done', 'thing', 'off', 'Lulu', 'character', 'film', 'constant', 'smoking.Patrick', 'still', 'same', 'physique', 'did', 'Dirty', 'Dancing', 'even', 'face', 'few', 'more', 'lines', 'also', 'scene', 'where', 'raunchy', 'dance', 'routine', 'Melanie', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'clay', 'scene', 'Ghost', 'scene', 'can', 'see', 'chemistry', 'once', 'was', 'watch', 'resurface', 'Ben', 'amp', 'Lulu', 'Lulu', 'rubs', 'off', 'Ben', 'completely', 'course', 'film.Penelope', 'Ann', 'Millar', 'Ben', 'wife', 'Claire', 'psychiatrist', 'who', 'very', 'insecure', 'husband', 'relationship', 'ex', 'country', 'trying', 'save', 'disintegrating', 'marriage', 'something', 'later', 'regret', 'obvious', 'way', 'Ben', 'amp', 'Claire', 'act', 'other', 'marriage', 'been', 'long', 'time', 'what', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'happen', ""n't"", 'Claire', 'amp', 'Lulu', 'first', 'meeting', 'quickly', 'slanging', 'match', 'not', 'catfight', 'was', 'hoping', 'two', 'women', 'who', 'are', 'love', 'same', 'man', 'tell', 'other', 'few', 'home', 'truths', 'Lulu', 'open', 'up', 'other', 'have', ""n't"", 'done', 'long', 'time', 'scene', 'really', 'emotional', 'even', 'most', 'cold', 'hearted', 'person', 'will', 'shed', 'tear.Joseph', 'Gordon-Levitt', 'small', 'role', 'end', 'reason', 'Lulu', 'back', 'contact', 'Ben', 'son', '16', 'decide', 'should', 'be', 'time', 'saw', 'Bad', 'idea', 'meeting', 'bad', 'worse', 'scene', 'full', 'tension', 'viewer', 'feel', 'very', 'awkward', 'just', 'watching', 'exchanges', 'really', 'feel', 'sorry', 'Lulu', 'Ben', 'Ben', 'really', 'hard', 'walk', 'child', 'life', '16', 'years', 'really', 'liked', 'Joseph', '10', 'Things', 'Hate', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'stand', 'character.Being', 'TV', 'movie', 'very', 'bad', 'soundtrack', 'music', 'intrusive', 'best', 'times.Lulu', 'full', 'frontal', 'one', 'scene', 'diving', 'swimming', 'pool', 'far', 'away', 'shot', 'saw', 'too', 'much', 'liking', 'still', 'good', 'figure', 'age', 'remind', 'lot', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'character', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'play', 'very', 'similar', 'characters', 'even', 'act', 'same', 'way', 'certain', 'scenes', 'Angelina', 'character', 'had', 'bit', 'more', 'are', 'few', 'flashbacks', 'film', 'overly', 'loud', 'music', 'appear', 'unannounced', 'can', 'get', 'confusing.This', 'film', 'thought', 'could', 'have', 'showed', 'more', 'Lulu', 'schizophrenia', 'rather', 'just', 'odd', 'bits', 'do', 'show', 'hating', 'loud', 'noise', 'etc', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'characteristics', 'schizophrenia', 'then', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'necessarily', 'known', 'Lulu', 'was', 'apart', 'note', 'bottom', 'beginning', 'film', 'was', 'half', 'expecting', 'see', 'schizophrenics', 'shown', 'bad', 'light', 'Lulu', 'was', 'portrayed', 'really', 'well.I', 'did', 'expect', 'film', 'end', 'sad', 'note', 'was', 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'did', ""n't"", 'was', 'saying', 'myself', 'end', ""'re"", 'not', 'going', 'show', 'what', 'show', 'happened', 'characters', '18', 'months', 'Which', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'often', 'find', 'wanting', 'more', 'film', 'wanting', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'characters', 'end', 'up', 'disappointed', 'end', 'song', 'Say', 'Goodbye', 'Lauren', 'Kinkade', 'movie', 'brilliantly', 'such', 'sad', 'song', 'ending', 'really', 'sad', 'happy', 'ending']",Along for the Ride

There's a really touching scene in the airplane between Miller and Steven Bauer (one of Griffith's real-life exs) that was award worthy.
