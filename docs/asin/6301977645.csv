286659,A20Y3T55MJBAEH,6301977645,"Anastasia Beaverhausen ""AB""","[0, 4]","A truly odd experience to watch now.  Only recommended if you're looking for some cool '80s nostalgia:  Elegant camera angles and blue filters.  Gorgeous minimalist lofts. Shocking lack of political correctness. (One scene seems even far more pro rape than that infamous scene in Gone with the Wind.) And Mickey Rourke.  However Dragon  feels decidedly low budget, abrupt, overly stylized and cheesy, and laughably inconsistent, esp. character wise.  Stone was practicing at this point, trying to discover his own style.  One minute he's shooting a music video, the next borrowing the swelling violins and saucy exchange of a Sam Spade movie, the next it looks like he's shooting a spaghetti western in Mexico, but with asian actors. And there aren't a whole lot of transitions to hold all this together. As much as I love '80s Rourke-9 1/2 weeks is near sacred to me-this would have worked better with someone older, not Rourke playing so much older, with Halloween vampire highlights/greylights.  And Rourke seems too hard to be trying to be an angry er ""cracked"" middle age crackpot.  I think Nick Nolte-channeling a toned down Jerry from ""Down and Out in Beverly Hills""-would have been great in this.Because of the confusion about his age (and the harping on Vietnam gets tired, although an '80s hallmark)it is disturbing to see him married to such a grandmotherly looking actress. By today's standards it is astounding.  The movie seems confused about the couples age too-his senior citizen looking wife (She honestly bears a resemblance to Angela Lansbury and has a tiresome martyr complet to boot.) is trying to conceive?!! Admittedly this is preferable to today.  What a great time for older actresses. (Except for the whole rape part-granted feminists go way too far today-but honestly where were they on this film?) And it's nice to think that Hollywood didn't have Woody Allen's pedophiliac preference for young girls with geriatric men.  How things have changed.  Nonetheless the age confusion drove me crazy.",3,Product of another Time,1246752000,"07 5, 2009",2009,2021,"['truly', 'odd', 'experience', 'watch', 'now', 'Only', 'recommended', ""'re"", 'looking', 'cool', ""'80s"", 'nostalgia', 'Elegant', 'camera', 'angles', 'blue', 'filters', 'Gorgeous', 'minimalist', 'lofts', 'Shocking', 'lack', 'political', 'correctness', 'One', 'scene', 'even', 'far', 'more', 'pro', 'rape', 'infamous', 'scene', 'Gone', 'Wind', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'However', 'Dragon', 'feels', 'decidedly', 'low', 'budget', 'abrupt', 'overly', 'stylized', 'cheesy', 'laughably', 'inconsistent', 'esp', 'character', 'wise', 'Stone', 'was', 'practicing', 'point', 'trying', 'discover', 'own', 'style', 'One', 'minute', 'shooting', 'music', 'video', 'next', 'borrowing', 'swelling', 'violins', 'saucy', 'exchange', 'Sam', 'Spade', 'movie', 'next', 'shooting', 'spaghetti', 'western', 'Mexico', 'asian', 'actors', 'are', ""n't"", 'whole', 'lot', 'transitions', 'hold', 'together', 'As', 'much', 'love', ""'80s"", 'Rourke-9', '1/2', 'weeks', 'near', 'sacred', 'me-this', 'would', 'have', 'worked', 'better', 'someone', 'older', 'not', 'Rourke', 'playing', 'so', 'much', 'older', 'Halloween', 'vampire', 'highlights/greylights', 'Rourke', 'too', 'hard', 'be', 'trying', 'be', 'angry', 'er', 'cracked', 'middle', 'age', 'crackpot', 'think', 'Nick', 'Nolte-channeling', 'toned', 'down', 'Jerry', 'Down', 'Out', 'Beverly', 'Hills', '-would', 'have', 'been', 'great', 'this.Because', 'confusion', 'age', 'harping', 'Vietnam', 'tired', ""'80s"", 'hallmark', 'disturbing', 'see', 'married', 'such', 'grandmotherly', 'looking', 'actress', 'today', 'standards', 'astounding', 'movie', 'confused', 'couples', 'age', 'too-his', 'senior', 'citizen', 'looking', 'wife', 'honestly', 'resemblance', 'Angela', 'Lansbury', 'tiresome', 'martyr', 'complet', 'boot', 'trying', 'conceive', 'Admittedly', 'preferable', 'today', 'What', 'great', 'time', 'older', 'actresses', 'whole', 'rape', 'part-granted', 'feminists', 'go', 'way', 'too', 'far', 'today-but', 'honestly', 'where', 'were', 'film', 'nice', 'think', 'Hollywood', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'Woody', 'Allen', 'pedophiliac', 'preference', 'young', 'girls', 'geriatric', 'men', 'How', 'things', 'have', 'changed', 'age', 'confusion', 'drove', 'crazy']",N/A

I know because I saw them while visiting the set.  The real Chinatown has streets so narrow you could not possibly film on them.  However, that's where the 'pretend' ends and the gritty reality of life on Canal Street begins.While this movie was made over 20 years ago, it not only holds up over time, it gets better with age.  It's like the best Dim Sum you ever had.  You want it again and again.  I am delighted it is now out on DVD. I just wish they would re-release 'Year Of The Dragon' in theaters so a new generation of filmgoers could see the genius involved.John Lone, as always, is quiet elegance.  A wonderful actor with one of the best faces in the business.  Mickey Rourke was Mickey Rourke.  The guy we fell in love with.  Not the Mickey Rourke of today who has had so much plastic surgery we can't recognize him anymore.  He is brash, crass, electric.  A real spitfire of an actor.  Ariane, poor soul, was badly miscast.  The material was way over her head.You see small parts in the film played by actors who were just getting started in the business.  Eddie Jones, the great character actor who played my daughter's grandfather in a Harry Kondolian play in NYC, is the tough Cop on horseback in the first part of the film.  He is still around playing great roles.  John Lone and Ariane have long since left the screen.  I really miss Lone.  A wonderful actor.The film is not a small film.  It's big in grandure and in scope.  Lone travels to Thailand, Hong Kong.  This film sneaks up on you when you least expect it and makes you think.  The writing is superb.  Cinematography incredible.  Music, acting, you name it.  The very best film has to offer.As someone who photographed Chinatown for many years here in NYC, it is very special to me.  I love this film.

286665,A3KV7FISWAW06A,6301977645,Dansa,"[3, 3]","Scripted by Oliver Stone, ""Year of the Dragon"" is a dark, edgy, and complex action film rich in weighty character study and politically incorrect social issues. Working with a huge budget, award winning director Michael Cimino suavely glides his camera through gorgeous detailed sets that range from elaborate urban settings to drab suburban trappings and even exotic global locations. Despite the early 80s setting and a few dated hair cuts, the film is strangely timeless, drawing heavily from the gritty look of classic gangster films. The shoot outs and chase sequences are small scale and spacious but bloody and shocking when they erupt at unexpected moments, escalating in brutality and emotional impact as the film progresses. There's also some impressive real car wreckage you just don't see in modern films.Already world weary and battle scarred, Mickey Rourke dominates the movie as its morally ambiguous protagonist, delivering a charismatic but layered performance that demands the audience understand him even if they don't completely like everything about him. He comes across as racist, sexist, and selfish but also genuinely tragic and heroic. The physicality he brings to the role is also impressive; his crude realistic punches putting the decade's bigger action stars to shame. The soft spoken John Lone is as classy and unusual as villains get, ruthless but cool and oddly likable. Tall husky voiced, Ariane Koizumi gives a strong supporting performance as Rourke's reluctant lover, their anti-cliche romance seeming geniune despite an emotional distance on the surface.

While it purports to be about the Chinese underworld I don't think I knew any more on the topic than before I watched this film.  I attribute this to the script by director Michael Cimino and Oliver Stone which has more than it's share of bloated rhetoric.  Mickey Rourke, not helped by the silver dye job, does the best he can with the dialogue he's forced to spew as Stanley White, returning Vietnam vet turned police captain who has a personal vendetta in cleaning up Chinatown that remains vague to me.  Arianne, who plays the TV reporter whom Rourke beds, has to be one of the worst actresses this side of ""Showgirls"".  The film is elevated by the performance of John Lone as Joey Tai, ruthlessly ambitious crimelord.  Lone is so coolly suave that you wish that more of the film had dedicated itself to his character instead of Rourke's.  I do admire Cimino as a director, however.

Wong,"[2, 9]","When I saw this film in a multiplex I was so turned off by Cimino's over-wrought direction and the unsympathetic character played by the usually excellent Mickey Rourke--that I went into another theater and saw something else. Could this be the same director who several years before, won the Oscar for ""The Deer Hunter""?!  It was rumored that Robert DeNiro was offered the part and turned it down and for good reason--Stanley White, the main character, is a bigot and ex-Vietnam veteran who is suppose to be the character we are suppose to be sympathetic with.  Months after this film I did read the original novel by Robert Daley and Stanley White was much more sympathetic character than what wound up on the screen.  In fact Daley asked the producers to take his name off the credits of the movie since it bore very little resemblance to the story he wrote.  It's bizarre when you find yourself rooting for the villain of the piece, the excellent John Lone as Joey Tai, than the main character.  If you like Mickey Rourke as I normally do, then rent ""The Pope of Greenwich Village"", ""Barfly"", ""A Prayer for the Dying"" and ""Johnny Handsome"" or better yet see his Oscar nominated ""The Wrestler"".

286670,AXO4PQU0XG3TG,6301977645,Dwight,"[0, 0]","What is this movie about other than showing a lot of typical Toisan faces?  The movie starts off with a long shot of old Mott Street and Pell and Doyer Streets so that is very fun and reminiscent of those souvenir postcards in the variety of bright colors and Chinese signage.Twenty years later, rewatching this hateful film (boycott Giada De Laurentiis!) - I noticed other than the unrealistic or perhaps prophetic (ten years later) depiction, Mickey Rourke is orignally prettier than Japanese Dutch Airane Koizumi and John Lone - he had a DOLLFACE - I never noticed that before but he would look prettier in drag than John Lone does.  John Lone has a wide face on camera - he IS pretty in person though.Mickey Rourke was amazingly weird in Iron Man 2 and now I think he's a really good actor.  In this film, he like the film and the dialogue is rude and obnoxious and at the time, uncommonly foulmouthed and couple that with his bizarre (at the time) horrible treatment of the JapaneseChinese newswoman was really distracting.  It made NO SENSE.  I THINK he's coddling protecting the JAPANESE/GERMAN from the horrible Chinese criminal element - is that for real?I think this movie served to create an idea of Chinatown for some reason.  Maybe as a warning to outside predators.One hour in, he visits Ariane Koizumi's watchtower looking penthouse - yes, she has a soaking tub - in the common area.  This scene is amazing - he calls her a VAMPIRE and she makes San Francisco look really bad - disrespecting veterans, police and confusing her racial epitaphs - she calls HIM ""a crackpot racist"" but she might be the racist because she said earlier ""I'm not some gook hooker on the streets of Saigon"" and since John Lone has such a wide unattractive face in drag like Yoko Ono, I wonder if the script shouts out to the Comfort Women because Yoko Ono's father was part of the Japanese operation in Vietnam during the war and NO DOUBT they transported Comfort Women there as well and NO DOUBT Japanese females had and have NO SYMPATHY for the plight of the gangrape victims of Corea.  Also, Denis Dun described Ariane Koizumi's character as ""aristocrat"" who speaks Mandarin after she throws a tantrum that cops are using her living room which is NOT a Northern Han Chinese response to having police as guests in their home.  It's more anti marines in Okinawa, nu?""Coal trucks were sent out to collect women. Age didn't matter; girls as young as 11 and women as old as 80. Virgins were prized to affirm a warrior's virility. Twenty soldiers might rape a woman. Or, out of sadism, they might order a father on a daughter.""Maybe Mickey Rourke's Polish ""peasant"" (compared to the LAST Emperor?? lol) is most honest in this scene when he tells her how much he hates her - and then they copulate - that was very shocking when it came out - it was crazy - but now it just looks like Cold War - but hilarious because if that's true, Mickey Rourke is awesome.This scene also has some amazing lines out of Ariane Koizumi's mouth about her ROCKIN' boyfriend ""Roger"" who is a LAWYER and Ivy League and a ""Gentleman.""  and RICH!ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwand then Mickey Rourke asks if he hasn't proposed because SHE's not good enough!! Hahahahha.Half an hour later, Mickey Rourke has NUNS like the Mother Superior fromThe Sound of Musictranslating a wire and she says it's been awhile since she's heard THE HAKKA DIALECT - omigod - I think the Hakka aren't actually Han Chinese - I think they're from the other side of the Great Wall hence their claiim that they were flooded out of their ancestral home in the North and HAVE to migrate to various parts of China - but as other Chinese know - flood waters RECEDE and people return home - and the Hakka NEVER have pilgramages to their true point of origin.John Lone is not speaking Hakka in that scene though but I think that the Chinese American originally cast in Ariane Koizumi's part and publicly quit citing the antiChinese racism in this movie and in particular her role may have just been a publicity stunt because you have THE LAST EMPEROR who is not a Han behaving badly in Chinatown - and the GOOD Asian American is a Japanese hybrid from San Francisco ofSmug Alert!.So what is this film claiming?  Are the Italians with their own problems both with Huns (hybrid of Mongolians and Germans) and The Yellow Horde that caused the Black Death HINTING that the criminal element that PIVOTS Chinatown into a deeper level of corruption and violent is orchestrated by MONGOLIAN hybrids?  Because I believe a Japanese actor with a noticeable Japanese accent is playing the role of the drug grower in the Golden Triangle probably based on the KMT army that is supposed to be there growing drugs - BUT the Japanese guy has actually usurped this really old decrepit man who speaks Cantonese (pleading for his life) when the Japanese guy wants John Lone to shoot him (very WW2 and very POW camp given the setting with the straw huts and the humidity).  And Ariane Koizumi's nude scene shows a bruise on the side of her upper thigh that could represent the Mongolian blue spot birthmark.  Also, the Italian gangster is surnamed Tedesco which means ""German"" in Italian.AND I think the scriptwriters worked in a Chinesey Pun in the name of the character White Powder surname Ma because Ma means horse in Chinese as in that euphemism about riding the white stallion = being on drugs.  Oooh ...punning.  John Lone buys the old man's life which is a very Chinese thing to do.At the time, this movie was SO OFFENSIVE but after twenty years, it's still offensive but we are much more weary.  Without subtitles, an old man working in a soybean factory says in Chinese that this is ""ruining Chinese people's image.""  His lines are the most Chinese thing about this film.  But later he is shown as a converted Christian as if original heathen Chinese aren't as nice or have integrity or friendliness.It's so untrue  and senseless - the Vietnamese coming in???  REALLY?so many things make no sense",2,I watch this movie for John Lone but he's barely in it.

In truth, the only notable flaw in the film is the acting talents of Arianne; despite this, I found her tolerable as her interaction with Rourke was truly electric.  As to the demagogues, I must say that they arrived a little late to the party: Cimino's Deer Hunter portrayed Asians in a much more demeaning light than anything here.  Besides that, have any of those protesters seen the kinds of movies put out en masse from Hong Kong?  They are much more glitzy violent than anything portrayed here (for example check out John Wu's ""The Killer"" or Hard-Boiled"").Mickey Rourke is awesome as usual, he defined cool in the 1980s just as Errol Flynn did for the 1930s.  And just like Errol Flynn, he later descended into mediocrity, making poor personal decisions and then taking poor roles and minor roles which made a mockery of his previously fine work.  But neither Flynn nor Rourke were as bad as OJ Simpson or Enron executives.  You don't have to love what they became to enjoy what they previously achieved.In many ways Cimino fulfilled a potential avenue which Roman Polanski never explored in his 1974 neo-noir masterpiece, Chinatown.  That film spent all of one scene in its namesake locale.  Year of the Dragon takes us right into the heart of New York City's Chinatown, for better and for worse.  Its a fairly conventional narrative, but you can almost smell the pastries cooking and wet garbage seething on those Manhattan streets.

286676,A8F2AZWB20X1H,6301977645,JLind555,"[26, 31]","""Year of the Dragon"" takes us into a world most of us never knew existed, let alone have seen: the seamy underbelly of New York City's Chinatown, a world unknown to the outsiders who visit the trendy restaurants and tourist traps.  It's the story of the Asian heroin trade controlled by the Chinese triads; the young Chinese drug lord who will stop at nothing to take it over, and the police captain who will stop at nothing to destroy him.  As Captain Stanley White, Mickey Rourke gives the performance of his career; he doesn't just act Stanley White, he is Stanley White.  And Stanley White, as Rourke portrays him, is a straight-up jerk.  This guy is about as subtle as a runaway steamroller.  He's totally self-centered, treats his wife like part of the furniture, and barges into his Chinese girlfriend's home and takes it over is if he owned it.  And John Lone is remarkable as Joey Tai, the young drug lord who cynically arranges for the murder of his own father-in-law and then tells the members of the triad that it's time for a new and younger leadership.  The battle lines are drawn; Tai and White are going to upset the uneasy truce that has existed between the Chinatown police precinct and the triads and are going head to head.  The results are calamitous.  White doesn't care who gets into harm's way in his zeal to do Tai and the triad in, and Tai ignites the wrath of his elders in the triad when he forgets the ancient Chinese philosphy that recommends moderation in everything and goes for broke, bringing down the unwanted attention of the NYPD and the press into the triad's activities.  Tai finally goes too far in directly attacking White's family and girlfriend, and all hell breaks loose.  We know how the movie is going to end, and it gets there eventually, but not before the blood and gore is splattered all over the screen.The movie goes from Chinatown, to the ethnic enclave of Polish-American Brooklyn, to the opium hills of southeast Asia and back again, and the pace varies from fast to warp-speed.  The acting is generally excellent, with some of the best performances being given by the Chinese actors playing the men of the triad and the boys and girls of the gang that carries out and enforces their activities.  One of the most shocking scenes in the movie is White's gun battle with two exquisitely beautiful Chinese girls who look like porcelain dolls and act like the most vicious, cold-blooded killers imaginable.  The major supporting cast is very good indeed; Caroline Kava has never been one of my favorite actresses but in this movie she is terrific as White's long-suffering and neglected wife, who has been forced to put off motherhood at his demand only to find herself tossed on the dump heap when she is abandoned for a younger and more exotic woman.  The movie has been panned as sexist, racist and overly violent, but it's not a pretty film and it doesn't tell a pretty story.  It's down and gritty and tells it like it is.

Quebec,"[7, 18]","This story, of a gruff, dysfunctional, but brilliant detective out to bring down the Triads is a fast paced & very entertaining action film, meant to capitialize on the Chinatown shoot-outs at The Golden Dragon restaurants, that had captured the attention of the news media back in the late 1970's.That said, the characters, especially Mickey Rourke's lead, are somewhat pedestrian & conventional.  (Do ALL brilliant book & movie detectives have to have screwed up personal lives?!)Besides that, I wondered about why a POLISH-American cop would be so personally obsessed about taking out the CHINESE mafia?I'm NOT into political correctness. (Though I'm Chinese by descent, I wasn't so gung-ho about all of the protesting from the Asian activists about this movie back in the '80's.  After all, there are more important things to worry about than an action flick!)But I am into BELIEVABLE films.  One reviewer who liked this movie said that director Cimino ""kept it real.""  If it was ""real"", the lead (both in the book & in the movie) would have been someone with a very personal stake in bringing down the Triads.  That would have justified his obsession AT THE BEGINNING OF THE STORY.  (It's one thing to have him see it as just a job at the beginning, then have him obsessed AFTER they attack his friends & family.  But this guy is so gung-ho RIGHT AT THE START!)Politically correct or not....he should have been a Chinese, and not a Polish cop.  (That goes for the book, as well as the movie!)That said, the leading lady, a Chinese-American reporter, is the opposite....she's just too politically correct (in her mouthings about rights & such, not in her depiction) to be believable.  (She might be a good actress, but I found her character annoying.  It wasn't her fault.  I blame the writers!)Worst of all was John Lone's character.  He's also a good actor, but in the story, he's absolutely no match, mentally or (especially) physically for Rourke's character.  A villain should be the equal of the hero, in order to create audience tension (even though you know the good guy is supposed to win in the end.)  But Rourke just man-handles Lone in a bathroom with no trouble at all (at least, not until some girl bodyguards start shooting at Rourke.)  I thought Triad leaders were supposed to be trained in martial-arts!  (That's not a stereotype, that's really a part of their traditions & rituals.)Of course, Rourke should win.

Based on the novel by Richard Daley and adapted for the screen by Oliver Stone and director Michael Cimino - YEAR OF THE DRAGON is a mid-80s crime noir thriller that caused a substantial amount of uproar among New York's Chinese community at the time of its release. Rourke's portrayal of Stanley ""Stan"" White (born Stanis&#322;aw Luszinski) is somewhat preachy and repetitive, and the film as a whole seems to drown under its own weight of self-importance.

286689,A1TK6R2JSC97HL,6301977645,Rottenberg's rotten book review,"[1, 4]","Mickey Rourke is Stanley White, an angry white detective and marine Vietnam vet reassigned to Chinatown.  Sent downtown with the idea to stay out of trouble, White immediately butts heads with community figures he's convinced run the local mob.  Not just a strictly law-and-order, White is on a mission against a larger evil.  Convinced that local Chinese mobsters are just tentacles of larger criminal syndicates called Triads (White educates his superiors that it was the Chinese, not the Italians who conceived ""organized crime""), White pursues respected members of the City's Chinese community.  Unfortunately, the situation is more desperate than White realizes - with John Lone as Joey Tai, an up-and-coming figure among the community who is also on the verge of wresting control of the Triads from its aging leaders.  Poised to flood America with narcotics from Southeast Asia, Tai soon realizes that White is more than an annoyance, and decides to eliminate him.  Meanwhile, White proves less able to crack the Triads than his own career - alienating superiors who are convinced that he's harassing Tai.  As Tai and White fight a war that soon becomes personal, the Triad readies itself to usher in a new age in organized crime.This is yet the only Cimino flick I've ever seen, though it seems to confirm what I've heard about ""Heaven's Gate"".  You wander through the twisting alleys of the script and wonder just what it's about.  It's about drugs, and Chinese and white cops who prove willfully blind to the encroaching triads.  But that doesn't begin to explain Stan White or his seemingly bottomless reservoir of piety.  Why does he care so much?  He can only ask back - how can anybody care too much?  What does he really want?  Arresting people for crimes isn't enough - he's out for the moral rot that bred the Triads, and sets out to war against Chinatown.  We're supposed to assume that White's stint in the Marines has turned him into the perfect righteous cop, but that would make him a nightmare no matter where he was assigned (in his first few scenes he proves to have some background info on Triads suggesting a peculiar obsession for them).  Equally unfortunate is that while ""Dragon"" has the makings of a character-driven flick, there are so few compelling characters populating it.  A beautiful Chinese TV reporter w/whom White falls in love with, the aging leaders of the Triad, a young Chinese cop who sticks his neck out for White, Tai, White's lazy and risk-shy bosses, other cops - they're all one-note props next to Rourke's character.

White's supposed ""racism"" and ""sexism"" is clearly meant to be part humor, part attack on the PC driven staff members of his Police department that turn the other cheek while blood flows in Chinatown. In his own way, Rourke's character shows the most respect to the Chinese (and Triad members) in this film by treating them as equals. Whether he ""uses"" them, as another reviewer stated is quite questionable. White is a believer in the American dream, and American justice - which he wants all to share in. And while he does not seem to be concerned as much with the old Triad members that are rational, calm and stay hidden, he does have a serious issue with the new generation that don't seem to respect anything, least of all the laws of the United States.White's wife is clearly not bringing him pleasure any longer, and he engages in an affair with a young Asian reporter. Their relationship, at least to me, seems very believable. White seems to drag both this reporter and a young Chinese detective kicking and screaming (as well as some Nuns) to ""do the right thing"". Whether they live or die because of this is irrelevant. White is the archetype of the Lone Wolf, the single individualist standing up against corruption and evil. The fact that he does it with a punch, a smile and a knowledge of fine Chinese cuisine (well sort of) makes it even better. In fact, the sense I had from watching this film was that White loves being the outsider, and the respect of the Chinese in Chinatown seemed to mean a lot more to him than that of his own ""culture"". (in truth all of these cultures are ""true"" American)The music, direction and acting of all involved here are great. And the unabashed way that the subject matter is dealt with makes one still believe in everything that once made America great and still sometimes does - individualism, heroism and great Chinese culture!Of course, most modern men and women would only scream for Stanley White when some building blows up or a man with a gun is standing in their bank. What that tells you about White, America and today's culture is something to reflect on. We all needs heroes.

286696,A220FJEQNGMSRN,6301977645,Trevor Willsmer,"[4, 5]","Michael Cimino said part of the reason he made it Year of the Dragon was to prove that he could come in on time and on budget (which he did) after being fired from Footloose for asking for a very minor increase in the budget (can you blame them after Heaven's Gate?) and seeing The Yellow Jersey and Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (a four hour western with most of the dialog in Sioux? Sure, Mr Cimino, and shall we declare bankruptcy now to save time?) fall through. Tempting fate, Cimino even cast two of the bit players from Heaven's Gate in the leads, Mickey Rourke sporting stylishly grayed hair and Caroline Kava as his ovulating wife.Yes, the dialogue is highly variable and the epilogue (""He's a good cop but he just won't give up!"") is worthy of public ridicule. Yes, the Vietnam parallels are overplayed at every opportunity (""It's just like Vietnam! Nobody wants to win this thing!""). Yes, the plot is pretty much standard-issue. Yes, co-writer Oliver Stone and Cimino show off their research by giving characters big historical speeches about Chinese civilization and the hundred years of discrimination the Chinese suffered in America at every turn. Yes, the motivation is sometimes laughable - they kill Rourke's partners and a family member but it's only when they lay hands on his mistress that he decides that ""This time he's gone TOO FAR!"" But there's an epic grandeur to the film that's unusual in the cop movie genre. It's not just scenes like the spectacular entry into a drug-dealing Thai general's village either: even the nightclub where Mickey Rourke beats up John Lone (quite excellent here) is large enough to hold an aircraft carrier. Cimino doesn't really do small, and his sense of grandeur gives the film a gravity it doesn't really deserve. And his eye for a good set piece that deserted his subsequent films is still very visible in the restaurant shootout. Overblown it may be, but it's far from being just a guilty pleasure.The NTSC edition has a trailer and an audio commentary by Cimino.",4,"""This is Chinatown, White...""",1203120000,"02 16, 2008",2008,2023,"['Michael', 'Cimino', 'said', 'part', 'reason', 'made', 'Year', 'Dragon', 'was', 'prove', 'could', 'come', 'time', 'budget', 'did', 'being', 'fired', 'Footloose', 'asking', 'very', 'minor', 'increase', 'budget', 'can', 'blame', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'seeing', 'Yellow', 'Jersey', 'Bury', 'My', 'Heart', 'Wounded', 'Knee', 'four', 'hour', 'western', 'most', 'dialog', 'Sioux', 'Sure', 'Mr', 'Cimino', 'shall', 'declare', 'bankruptcy', 'now', 'save', 'time', 'fall', 'Tempting', 'fate', 'Cimino', 'even', 'cast', 'two', 'bit', 'players', 'Heaven', 'Gate', 'leads', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'sporting', 'stylishly', 'grayed', 'hair', 'Caroline', 'Kava', 'ovulating', 'wife.Yes', 'dialogue', 'highly', 'variable', 'epilogue', 'good', 'cop', 'just', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'up', 'worthy', 'public', 'ridicule', 'Yes', 'Vietnam', 'parallels', 'are', 'overplayed', 'opportunity', 'just', 'like', 'Vietnam', 'Nobody', 'win', 'thing', 'Yes', 'plot', 'pretty', 'much', 'standard-issue', 'Yes', 'co-writer', 'Oliver', 'Stone', 'Cimino', 'show', 'off', 'research', 'giving', 'characters', 'big', 'historical', 'speeches', 'Chinese', 'civilization', 'hundred', 'years', 'discrimination', 'Chinese', 'suffered', 'America', 'turn', 'Yes', 'motivation', 'sometimes', 'laughable', 'kill', 'Rourke', 'partners', 'family', 'member', 'only', 'when', 'lay', 'hands', 'mistress', 'time', 'gone', 'TOO', 'FAR', 'epic', 'grandeur', 'film', 'unusual', 'cop', 'movie', 'genre', 'not', 'just', 'scenes', 'spectacular', 'entry', 'drug-dealing', 'Thai', 'general', 'village', 'even', 'nightclub', 'where', 'Mickey', 'Rourke', 'up', 'John', 'Lone', 'quite', 'excellent', 'here', 'large', 'enough', 'hold', 'aircraft', 'carrier', 'Cimino', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'small', 'sense', 'grandeur', 'film', 'gravity', ""n't"", 'really', 'deserve', 'eye', 'good', 'set', 'piece', 'deserted', 'subsequent', 'films', 'still', 'very', 'visible', 'restaurant', 'shootout', 'may', 'be', 'far', 'being', 'just', 'guilty', 'pleasure.The', 'NTSC', 'edition', 'trailer', 'audio', 'commentary', 'Cimino']",N/A
