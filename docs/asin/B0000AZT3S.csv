I received it as a Christmas gift this year and I'm happy about it. This is a great family movie for Christmas. Plenty of comedy and a great cast. The story centers around Santa Jr being arrested right before he needs to deliver presents for Christmas. Fortunately some people at the police station begin to believe him when he says he is really Santa Jr. If you want some lighthearted entertainment I recommend this movie.CA Luster,4,Santa Jr.,1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,532,"['had', 'seen', 'parts', 'couple', 'times', 'Hallmark', 'channel', 'added', 'Amazon', 'wishlist', 'received', 'Christmas', 'gift', 'year', ""'m"", 'happy', 'great', 'family', 'movie', 'Christmas', 'Plenty', 'comedy', 'great', 'cast', 'story', 'centers', 'Santa', 'Jr', 'being', 'arrested', 'right', 'deliver', 'presents', 'Christmas', 'Fortunately', 'people', 'police', 'station', 'begin', 'believe', 'when', 'really', 'Santa', 'Jr', 'want', 'lighthearted', 'entertainment', 'recommend', 'movie.CA', 'Luster']",N/A
