Seeming an obscure project, the film put bodybuilding on the map and made it respectable.  The format of the film is used in documentaries and ""reality tv"" even today.  The focal point is the Mr. Olympia title, the pinnacle achievement for male bodybuilders, but the drama captures Arnold Schwarzenegger just before he plans retirement.  Add to that a rising rival in Lou Ferringo, and you have yourself a contest.  Interviewing the participants and unveiling their motivations and thoughts gives the whole presentation more meat and development. 'Pumping Iron' made bodybuilding into a mainstream and formidable franchise.Featuring grueling training sessions, and the indespensible interviews by key players, the whole spectacle has much more meaning.  Knowing that mental aspects are crucial to success in sports, Schwarzenegger proves that it is no less removed from bodybuilding than from any other sport.  Seeing supporting roles by dedicated players like Mike Katz gives the whole enterprise a greater scope and respectability.  (It is doubtful that the repurcussions of health clubs, and, Arnold's reign at the box office and over a state described as the ""fifth largest world economy"" would be possible--to name but a few influencial developments.)'Pumping Iron' is still a motivation powerhouse, especially seeing all the primitive equipment the contestants used; all of which has significantly improved much since then.",5,Ripple (Ripped)  Effects,1181606400,"06 12, 2007",2007,1604,"['Now', 'thirty', 'years', 'was', 'released', ""'Pumping"", 'Iron', 'breakthrough', 'documentary', 'changed', 'much', 'culture', 'ripple', 'effects', 'are', 'still', 'pumping', 'today', 'Seeming', 'obscure', 'project', 'film', 'put', 'bodybuilding', 'map', 'made', 'respectable', 'format', 'film', 'used', 'documentaries', 'reality', 'tv', 'even', 'today', 'focal', 'point', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'title', 'pinnacle', 'achievement', 'male', 'bodybuilders', 'drama', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'just', 'retirement', 'Add', 'rising', 'rival', 'Lou', 'Ferringo', 'have', 'contest', 'Interviewing', 'participants', 'unveiling', 'motivations', 'thoughts', 'whole', 'presentation', 'more', 'meat', 'development', ""'Pumping"", 'Iron', 'made', 'bodybuilding', 'mainstream', 'formidable', 'franchise.Featuring', 'grueling', 'training', 'sessions', 'indespensible', 'interviews', 'key', 'players', 'whole', 'spectacle', 'much', 'more', 'meaning', 'Knowing', 'mental', 'aspects', 'are', 'crucial', 'success', 'sports', 'Schwarzenegger', 'less', 'removed', 'bodybuilding', 'other', 'sport', 'Seeing', 'supporting', 'roles', 'dedicated', 'players', 'Mike', 'Katz', 'whole', 'enterprise', 'greater', 'scope', 'respectability', 'doubtful', 'repurcussions', 'health', 'clubs', 'Arnold', 'reign', 'box', 'office', 'state', 'described', 'fifth', 'largest', 'world', 'economy', 'would', 'be', 'possible', 'name', 'few', 'influencial', 'developments', ""'Pumping"", 'Iron', 'still', 'motivation', 'powerhouse', 'especially', 'seeing', 'primitive', 'equipment', 'contestants', 'used', 'significantly', 'improved', 'much', 'then']",N/A

319548,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,6302548195,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[11, 12]","This is a fascinating docudrama, a ""blend of fact and fiction"" that centers on the preparation for the Mr. Olympia competition in Pretoria, South Africa, in 1975. The months before the competition is where the story has been enhanced for added dramatic effect, and follows the bodybuilders as they get ready from Muscle Beach in California to a gym in Brooklyn.Lou Ferrigno (later to be better known from his ""The Hulk"" character) is one of 5 time winner Schwarzenegger's main challengers, and their determination and discipline is extraordinary, and gives one admiration for what bodybuilders go through, and appreciation of their ability to change the human form, even if like me, one finds the look rather reptilian and gross.It's hard to not like Arnold Schwarzenneger, ""The Austrian Oak"", here 28 years old, 6'2 and 240 lbs. He has a disarming charm and bravado, and a natural intelligence, and the mental aspect of bodybuilding cannot be underestimated.Conceived, directed and written by George Butler, this is a marvelous look into the ""no pain, no gain"" challenge of sculpting with muscle. The pacing is great without a single scene lacking interest, and the editing excellent. Total time is 85 minutes.The DVD ""Extras"" are not to be missed, especially ""Raw Iron"", which includes many outtakes and tells how the film was made, and ""Iron Insights"", an interview with Schwarzenneger where one finds out which scenes were created and which were actual events.A film that will be of interest to anyone who likes success stories and how it is achieved by those who challenge themselves and keep focused on the positive, it will also be enjoyed for its pure entertainment value.",5,sculpting with muscle,1098316800,"10 21, 2004",2004,1680,"['fascinating', 'docudrama', 'blend', 'fact', 'fiction', 'preparation', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'competition', 'Pretoria', 'South', 'Africa', '1975', 'months', 'competition', 'where', 'story', 'been', 'enhanced', 'added', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'bodybuilders', 'get', 'ready', 'Muscle', 'Beach', 'California', 'gym', 'Brooklyn.Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'later', 'be', 'better', 'known', 'Hulk', 'character', 'one', '5', 'time', 'winner', 'Schwarzenegger', 'main', 'challengers', 'determination', 'discipline', 'extraordinary', 'one', 'admiration', 'what', 'bodybuilders', 'go', 'appreciation', 'ability', 'change', 'human', 'form', 'even', 'one', 'look', 'rather', 'reptilian', 'gross.It', 'hard', 'not', 'like', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenneger', 'Austrian', 'Oak', 'here', '28', 'years', 'old', '6', '2', '240', 'lbs', 'disarming', 'charm', 'bravado', 'natural', 'intelligence', 'mental', 'aspect', 'bodybuilding', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'underestimated.Conceived', 'directed', 'written', 'George', 'Butler', 'marvelous', 'look', 'pain', 'gain', 'challenge', 'sculpting', 'muscle', 'pacing', 'great', 'single', 'scene', 'lacking', 'interest', 'editing', 'excellent', 'Total', 'time', '85', 'minutes.The', 'DVD', 'Extras', 'are', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'especially', 'Raw', 'Iron', 'many', 'outtakes', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'Iron', 'Insights', 'interview', 'Schwarzenneger', 'where', 'one', 'out', 'scenes', 'were', 'created', 'were', 'actual', 'events.A', 'film', 'will', 'be', 'interest', 'anyone', 'who', 'success', 'stories', 'how', 'achieved', 'who', 'challenge', 'keep', 'focused', 'positive', 'will', 'also', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'value']",N/A
319549,A28IK698VHKLUK,6302548195,A. O. Sheepfielder,"[1, 2]","""Pumping Iron"" is just what a documentary about any type of competition should be.  Much like ""Spellbound"" and ""Mad Hot Ballroom,"" it pulls the viewer into the lives of the competitors.  You won't just root for the underdogs and boo the bad guys; you'll feel their pain and frustration and anxiety, as well as their determination and excitement and comradarie.""Pumping Iron"" was made in the mid '70s, long before cut abs and 22-inch biceps and were the physical ideal in American culture.  The film shows the greatest bodybuilders in the world training in basements and gyms smaller than the juice bar at the Bally's I used to go to.  Their equipment looks like they found it in a dumpster behind an inner-city jr. high.  These guys aren't spending hours and hours in the gym to get in shape for their next movie or to score a Powerbar endorsement.  They're doing it for the sheer love of the game . . . or art . . . or whatever you call bodybuilding.If you liked ""Spellbound"" and ""Mad Hot Ballroom,"" you'll enjoy ""Pumping Iron,"" too.  Even if you're not a fan of documentaries or of bodybuilding, it's fun to watch, just for the unintentionally comedic scenes, as well as the sad moments that, at least for me, hit close to home.  You'll get a kick out of hearing a 20-something-year-old, unknown Austrian bodybuilder with big dreams (guess who) compare the feeling of a good workout to, err, ""climaxing"" . . . repeatedly.  Watching a very young and shy Lou Ferrigno (pre-""Incredible Hulk"") take crap from his overbearing father will get to anyone who's ever had an obsessive parent pushing them in sports, music, academics, etc.Four stars.

319552,A1PASRZ81DY9C,6302548195,Austin Somlo,"[4, 9]","Viewed: 7/11Rate: 67/11: Pumping Iron is somewhat of a good documentary, but it still isn't deep as I hoped for. While Arnold Schwarzenegger is bragging about himself and how he plays mind games with others, he and his buddies aren't forthcoming about how they are able to get this big and how did they achieve these results. They don't explain their training regimen, diet plans, or anything like it. We just see them working out although it's not very much to see. Today, as we've seen the results of Performance Enhancement Drugs and anabolic steroids and how a countless of athletes has been caught over the years, bodybuilding has become joke of a sport. In fact, nobody takes the ""sport"" seriously at all, and that is the reason why it has been strictly an underground ""sport"" because it has never been able to gain an acceptance into the mainstream public. The biggest reason for it is the obvious steroid abuse that all bodybuilders engage in. I used to read Muscle and Fitness back then, and it was comical to me that the writers were promoting bodybuilding to be accepted in the Olympics. Ha...very funny. That's pretty much as it gets because it's where the ""sport"" dies. Even worse, Arnold lied about not attending his father's funeral. He also admitted to making up a lot of stories on the film. Oh great, thanks a lot. All in all, Pumping Iron is an okay film, but I didn't learn very much new.",3,LOOK AT ME! I am POSING! DAMMIT.

I was invited by Ed Jubinville, who ran the event, and got the chance to meet Arnold after the show. Yet my fondness for this expansive and revealing look into the intense subculture of bodybuilding is based more on the way it opened up the world of physical fitness and bodybuilding, which up to that point had been the subject of crude jokes and ridicule.This in many ways is a documentary, and photographer and videographer George Butler and author Charles Gaines (who wrote the original best-selling book, ""Pumping Iron"") took quite a risk in pushing this cultish film into the mainstream. Indeed, it originally played in arthouses and didn't become a hit until later. Yet it provided the spring for success Arnold needed to prove he could both emote and act (not many people understood the film was in fact scripted, such that many of the so-called stories and events were derived from the experiences of others,written into the film to provide a plot that otherwise didn't exist. thus events such as Schwarzenegger's father's death just before the Olympia (never happened that way), or Ken Waller plotting to undo Mike Katz.Likewise, the whole Mike Katz teeshirt routine. Still, at base this remains a fascinating look into the otherwise mysterious world of competitive bodybuilding, although the story described herein depicts a world that no longer exists as it did twenty five years ago. Nowadays bodybuilding is a big-money enterprise, and it has changed in the process of so evolving. People are in it for the money and the fame, and drugs play a much bigger part in the calculation than they did then. In that sense at least, it has lost its innocence. Still, for anyone so inclined, this is a memorable and intriguing story, featuring a numbner of world class strength athletes such as Schwarzenegger, Louis Ferrigno, Franco Columbo, Serge Nubret, and Mike Katz, all then in their prime.

319557,A16DMCKV9RMQGI,6302548195,"Continental Op ""philmarlowe39""","[5, 7]","Whenever I get bored with working out, I rent ""Pumping Iron"", the 1976 documentary that introduced the world to the sport of bodybuilding and its Grande Poo-bah Arnold Schwarzenegger.  I've seen this movie so many times that I really should buy it.  I mean, I've got the darn thing practically memorized!Basically, the filmmakers shot footage of the competitors for the 1975 Mr. Universe (the amateur competition) and Mr. Olympia (the professional competition).  What you see is the dizzing highs, the debilitating lows, and the creamy middles!  You get an up close and personal look at the sport itself, its varying philosophies, and what it takes to be a champion.The filmmakers go from Gold's Gym in Venice, CA to Brooklyn, NY to the island of Sardinia off the Italian peninsula and finally to Pretoria, South Africa to give you the inside scoop!  ...One thing the film does effectively is going in depth an analysing the personalities of the various athletes.  Amateur Mike Katz comes across as the most troubled bodybuilder.  Still haunted by the memories of being taunted by the other kids at school, he decided to hit the weights (and the horsepills) big time to ""show them"".  It's too bad they didn't film his high school reunion!  Can he overcome his demons and his Mr. Universe competitor Ken Waller?  Watch and see!Lou Ferrigno is the most sympathetic bodybuilder.  He's a man who overcame his childhood deafness to be a top competitor (and, later, The Incredible Hulk) and he's blessed with an enormous physical presence.  However, his dad (a retired NY cop) has decided to take over his training for the Olympia.  Does father know best?Franco Colombo is also pretty cool.  He came to the United States from Italy with only his muscles and his dreams of glory.  ...Last--and certainly not least--the most charismatic figure in this film is the defending Mr. Olympia champion, Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Arnold was far and away the best bodybuilder in the world in the 1970s, and his ruthless confidence--and wickedly sly sense of humor--makes him a treat to watch.  Arnold is ..., but he's incredibly charming.  It's easy to see why--with his attitude--he succeeded at bodybuilding and the movie business (and why he *may* succeed at politics if he so chooses).  It's truly a study of the mindset of a successful person.Anyhoo, some of you girly-men may get grossed out by huge, greasy men in posing trunks flexing their massive muscles.

319558,A39CX0EE4BZCZC,6302548195,Craig Connell,"[3, 3]","This was an extremely well-done ""documentary"" about men's bodybuilding, and the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest in particular. The film, of course, features the most famous bodybuilder of all time - Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are also profiles of his handful of competitors, most notably Lou Ferrigno, who gained notoriety by being the green monster in ""The Incredible Hulk"" TV series.Anyway, this film really shows the hard work (but no mention of steroids, by the way), the dedication and the egos of the bodybuilders, particularly Schwarzenegger. Arnold is the defending champion in the field and also has the biggest ego and is pictured as a man obsessed with winning. (To this day, has he ever lost in anything? Like him or not, what this man has accomplished is amazing.)Ferrigno's story is more about his dad than anything else, a man living out his dreams through his son. However, unlike other driven sports parents (i.e. Jimmy Piersall's father in ""Fear Strikes Out""), he gives ""Big Louie"" nothing but encouragement. However - please note, because I was fooled for years, too , until the DVD came out - that it turns out that much of the dad's role was made up just for the film, which is why I put ""documentary"" in quotes. In reality, he had little to do with his son's training, according to a feature on the DVD disc.There is a 25-year reunion with some of the people involved here, and it's very interesting, as they point out what was added for ""dramatic effect."" (These filmmakers must have inspired Michael Moore).Also featured in the film were several contestants in another competition, Mr. Universe, which was held at the same venue as the main attraction. In here, we see good guy (Mike Katz) battling bad guy (Ken Waller). Katz was particularly an intriguing study and provides a good example of what motivates many of these guys to build such incredible bodies.A lot of what these contestants do - and Schwarzenegger was a master at this - was play mind games at these contests, trying to ""psych out"" their opponents. All of that is pictured. The physical work, the mental games, the families of these guys, their social life, outlooks on life, and the behind-the-scenes look at a unique sport - all are fascinating. I found it such when I saw it over 25 years ago, and it's still an extremely entertaining film.",5,"Still Fascinating, 30 Years Later",1145491200,"04 20, 2006",2006,2330,"['was', 'extremely', 'well-done', 'documentary', 'men', 'bodybuilding', '1975', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'contest', 'particular', 'film', 'course', 'most', 'famous', 'bodybuilder', 'time', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'are', 'also', 'profiles', 'handful', 'competitors', 'most', 'notably', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'who', 'gained', 'notoriety', 'being', 'green', 'monster', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'TV', 'series.Anyway', 'film', 'really', 'hard', 'work', 'mention', 'steroids', 'way', 'dedication', 'egos', 'bodybuilders', 'particularly', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Arnold', 'defending', 'champion', 'field', 'also', 'biggest', 'ego', 'pictured', 'man', 'obsessed', 'winning', 'day', 'ever', 'lost', 'anything', 'not', 'what', 'man', 'accomplished', 'amazing', 'Ferrigno', 'story', 'more', 'dad', 'anything', 'else', 'man', 'living', 'out', 'dreams', 'son', 'However', 'other', 'driven', 'sports', 'parents', 'i.e', 'Jimmy', 'Piersall', 'father', 'Fear', 'Out', 'Big', 'Louie', 'nothing', 'encouragement', 'However', 'please', 'note', 'was', 'fooled', 'years', 'too', 'DVD', 'came', 'out', 'out', 'much', 'dad', 'role', 'was', 'made', 'up', 'just', 'film', 'why', 'put', 'documentary', 'quotes', 'reality', 'had', 'little', 'do', 'son', 'training', 'according', 'feature', 'DVD', '25-year', 'reunion', 'people', 'involved', 'here', 'very', 'interesting', 'point', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'added', 'dramatic', 'effect', 'filmmakers', 'must', 'have', 'inspired', 'Michael', 'Moore', '.Also', 'featured', 'film', 'were', 'several', 'contestants', 'competition', 'Mr.', 'Universe', 'was', 'held', 'same', 'venue', 'main', 'attraction', 'here', 'see', 'good', 'guy', 'Mike', 'Katz', 'battling', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ken', 'Waller', 'Katz', 'was', 'particularly', 'intriguing', 'study', 'good', 'example', 'what', 'many', 'guys', 'build', 'such', 'incredible', 'bodies.A', 'lot', 'what', 'contestants', 'do', 'Schwarzenegger', 'was', 'master', 'was', 'play', 'mind', 'games', 'contests', 'trying', 'psych', 'out', 'opponents', 'pictured', 'physical', 'work', 'mental', 'games', 'families', 'guys', 'social', 'life', 'life', 'behind-the-scenes', 'look', 'unique', 'sport', 'are', 'fascinating', 'found', 'such', 'when', 'saw', '25', 'years', 'ago', 'still', 'extremely', 'entertaining', 'film']",N/A

Schwarzenegger sits alone for the camera, reeling off a 13-minute monologue about what he did and didn't do during the making of the hit 1977 &quot;docudrama&quot; about a body-building competition.&quot;Now it is important for people to know what is real&quot; in the film, Schwarzenegger intones, not elaborating on the urgency. &quot;Certain things were not true.&quot;Schwarzenegger smoothly revisits the film's hot spots, notably marijuana use, his psychological pummeling of guileless rival Lou Ferrigno, and the scene in which he casually blows off his father's funeral in favor of training for the Mr. Olympia competition. Then there's that messy bit comparing orgasms and pumping iron.&quot;Pumping Iron: The 25th Anniversary Special Edition&quot; mostly reprises the film-and-featurettes package that ran on Cinemax a few years back. Video (4:3) and audio (5.1 or stereo) were remastered at the time, with decent results considering the source materials.The movie doesn't retain the shock value it did back in the mid-'70s, when body sculpting was just an odd subculture. But it's still an interesting time capsule. And Arnold's love affair with the camera gives a good indication of what's ahead. (Sorry, no groping.)In the extras, Live Schreiber gives terse, NFL films-style narration to a 15-minute intro and a making-of docu, both strengthened by outtakes plucked from the 100 or so hours shot by director George Butler (&quot;The Endurance&quot;).The featured bodybuilders reunite and talk about what the film meant to them, both good and bad.

Though this is essentially a ""docu-drama"" (it was instilled with some provocative, fictional elements, in order to make it more interesting), it still provides a fascinating look at one of America's most well known figures, while he was at the height of his bodybuilding career. Watching ""Pumping Iron"", it's easy to see how Arnold came to achieve such wealth and fame. His charisma is infectious, and nearly impossible to ignore. Likewise, his confidence is absolute and unshakable, and it's interesting to see how clearly he foresees his future success (and how accurate this vision came to be).What is equally interesting is that Arnold's flaws are also subtly revealed, in this probing look into his early years in America. Though he does have incredibly charisma and confidence, they come at a price- they also instill him with a sense of invincibility and entitlement. These flaws would eventually catch up with him, leading to his ""downfall"" (a lackluster political career, the exposure of his mistress and love child, his wife leaving him, and the decreased interest in his films).

But what you can expect is a nice documentary about how Arnold and other competitors go through the Mr.Olympia Bodybuilding contest.  I found it to truly be interesting for a documentary, but also let me say that I am a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan.  I wouldn't say that it worth [money]used, but I would say that if you can get a nice deal(like me), then this is a nice addition to your collection.  Arnold throws some of his humor in, and I feel that I learned more about bodybuilding in this movie, than I knew before I turned it on.

The setting is 1975 and the contests take place in Pretoria, South Africa.There are also several vignettes describing the backgrounds of the competitors listed above as well as Franco Columbo. In addition to the background of the main competitors, we get to see a side of them that is unknown to the audience (at that time) - such as Arnold's use of psychology against opponents and his unsatisfied thirst for victory.Visually, the training at Gold's Gym in Venice,CA and the posedown at the contests, are stunning.Overall, this is an excellent DVD to own.

The then famous movie house has since been torn down like everything else thst is worth while in this world. At the time I was teaching a weight lifting class at the Salvation Army Red Shield Boy's Club and I went with a crew of my students to see this timely movie. I already knew of most of the bodybuilders in the movie due to reading Wieder's copycat magazine ""Muscle Builder and Power"" a cheap York Barbell imitation. Some of the folks in the movie really paid their dues over the years and did great in the movie like Reg Park as the MC. Serge Nubret, Ken Waller, Eddie Gullianie (the early bird catches the workout)and even Big Lou. I think Mike Katz and Ed Corney were both exceptional. As always Arnold was outstanding as Arnold. In my opinion the movie would of been 10 times better if they left him and his other foreign buddy Culombo out. All the money Joe Weider spent to support Arnold as so all he had to do was lift, eat,rest,sleep and brag and use him to endorse his rip off protien products and half baked magazines there was no way he was going to see him loose the Olympia. Ed Corney was on the Original cover of the 1976 Pumping Iron - what happened? This movie was good but more focus should of been on the real life lifters not the ones that were spoon fed and supported by the famous Weider Brothers. Hey what happened after Sergio beat Arnold at the Olympia the first time they met. Sergio won because Weider knew he had to slide Arnold in easy or everyone would know what he was up to. The next year Arnold beat the unbeatable Sergio - BULL CRAP- talk about a Weider money stunt set-up. There is no way that if these two would compete in anything else then Weider's own IFBB would Arnold have a prayer over Sergio as no one else would either. I'm sure we all read the hype written be The Wieder Family: Sergio was smooth, Sergio was bloated, Sergio was not at his best - too bad bodybuilding is a Sport ran like a beauty contest and the winners are picked not earned. That's why I favor power lifting and weightlifting -pounds tell the winner not fame or money!

319574,A2FEGRJQNU51P9,6302548195,Joe Sherry,"[4, 4]","A film by George Butler and Robert FioreThis DVD was my first look into the world of professional bodybuilding and it provided the opportunity to Arnold Schwarzenegger back when he was a body builder.  I only know Arnold from his movies (and now that he is governor), so it was nice to see where he came from.  This documentary leads up to the Mr. Olympia competition.  Mr. Olympia is the pinnacle of professional bodybuilding.  If you can win this, you are the best in the world.  At the time of this film, Arnold had won for the previous 5 years and he was trying for his 6th Mr. Olympia title.  Also trying to win the title is Lou Ferrigno (who most people know as ""The Hulk"" from the television show).  Ferrigno is young and is entering his very first Mr. Olympia competition.It is easy to see why Arnold became such a success.  He has a magnetic personality, he is likable, and he already knew how to play the type of mind games (or political games) that would serve him well later in life.  In the documentary, Arnold talked about how he would get in the heads of his fellow competitors, no matter if they were better trained or in better shape, he would ultimately win the competition because he psyched them out.  He also talked about how some body builders would come up to him and ask for advice, and he would often give them bad advice so that they would not do as well in competition.It is also impressive to watch these body builders and see just what kind of shape they are in.  I think I saw muscles in places that I didn't know there were supposed to be muscles.  These are big men, but for the most part, they are not ridiculously muscled.  This documentary shows their personalities so that the men are more than just muscle-heads, and it shows their hopes and dreams as they have varying amounts of success and failure.  I thought this was a very interesting documentary and a fairly fast moving film.

319575,A1AT0GONN4A9NA,6302548195,"John P. Morgan ""Light Coach""","[4, 4]","Bodybuilding used to be a beautiful sport. There were a few guys that maybe weighed close to 250lbs but they still had lines, proportions, and symmetry. Nowadays the sport is filled with guys who weigh 300+ and they're only 5'11"". In a word, they look absolutely ridiculous. Now I wouldn't go down to Venice Beach and tell them that unless I really wanted to know what my butt smelled like, but there really is no sense of style about the sport anymore. In fact, I think the last time bodybuilding was a thing of real beauty and art was probably in 1983. I think as soon as Frank Zane walked off the stage for the last time, bodybuilding just became a freak show.This film is based on the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest in South Africa. It features the one and only Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now in this film he was 6'2"" and weighed about 235 lbs. Nothing to sneeze at, right? Well, if he walked onstage with today's synthetically charged monsters he would probably get sand kicked in his face.But this was the golden age of bodybuilding. This is a time when it had class and style and a sense of camaderie. Not any more. Sure, there was competition, but there was a sense of fun about the whole thing. In this reel of film, one gets to see the real Arnold. Nobody had more fun with his competition than Arnold. In one memorable scene Arnold is eating breakfast with Lou Ferrigno (the Incredible Hulk). It is the day before the actual contest and Arnold says with a sly grin on his face, ""Hey, Louie...I called my mother last night, I told her I already won...""Now you may think that that is unsportmanslike, but it's just classic Arnold. Before Arnold became a celebrity, he really did have a genuine personality. Maybe he still does, but his humor seems a lot more contrived these days whereas before it was more spontaneous and even childlike.I had an old VHS taped copy that I used to watch at least twice a year. I pulled it out not too long ago and I guess somewhere along the way somebody decided to tape a porno over it. Oh, there was plenty of pumping going on but it wasn't iron and they weren't at the gym. So I bought a new DVD copy and I'm glad I did. It is an excellent version.Pumping Iron isn't just a movie about muscleheads. It's an indepth look at the human soul. At least that's the way I look at it. You get to see what drives these guys to do what they do and it's very enlightening. We're such an interesting group of people, aren't we? So diverse and yet so similar.I am sure that alien beings have secured their own copy of this DVD and are trying to figure out what the human race is all about. Maybe that's why they haven't contacted us in awhile. Maybe they're just scared little gurly-men...but anyway, rent or buy a copy of this film and see Arnold at his best.Peace & Blessings...",5,"The ""Reel"" Arnold",1160524800,"10 11, 2006",2006,2802,"['Bodybuilding', 'used', 'be', 'beautiful', 'sport', 'were', 'few', 'guys', 'maybe', 'weighed', 'close', '250lbs', 'still', 'had', 'lines', 'proportions', 'symmetry', 'sport', 'filled', 'guys', 'who', 'weigh', '300+', ""'re"", 'only', ""5'11"", 'word', 'look', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'Now', 'would', ""n't"", 'go', 'down', 'Venice', 'Beach', 'tell', 'really', 'wanted', 'know', 'what', 'butt', 'smelled', 'there', 'really', 'sense', 'style', 'sport', 'anymore', 'fact', 'think', 'last', 'time', 'bodybuilding', 'was', 'thing', 'real', 'beauty', 'art', 'was', 'probably', '1983', 'think', 'as', 'soon', 'Frank', 'Zane', 'walked', 'off', 'stage', 'last', 'time', 'bodybuilding', 'just', 'became', 'freak', 'show.This', 'film', 'based', '1975', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'contest', 'South', 'Africa', 'one', 'only', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Now', 'film', 'was', '6', '2', 'weighed', '235', 'lbs', 'Nothing', 'sneeze', 'right', 'Well', 'walked', 'onstage', 'today', 'synthetically', 'charged', 'monsters', 'would', 'probably', 'get', 'sand', 'kicked', 'face.But', 'was', 'golden', 'age', 'bodybuilding', 'time', 'when', 'had', 'class', 'style', 'sense', 'camaderie', 'Not', 'more', 'Sure', 'was', 'competition', 'there', 'was', 'sense', 'fun', 'whole', 'thing', 'reel', 'film', 'one', 'see', 'real', 'Arnold', 'Nobody', 'had', 'more', 'fun', 'competition', 'Arnold', 'one', 'memorable', 'scene', 'Arnold', 'eating', 'breakfast', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'day', 'actual', 'contest', 'Arnold', 'sly', 'grin', 'face', 'Hey', 'Louie', 'called', 'mother', 'last', 'night', 'told', 'already', 'won', 'Now', 'may', 'think', 'unsportmanslike', 'just', 'classic', 'Arnold', 'Arnold', 'became', 'celebrity', 'really', 'did', 'have', 'genuine', 'personality', 'Maybe', 'still', 'humor', 'lot', 'more', 'contrived', 'days', 'whereas', 'was', 'more', 'spontaneous', 'even', 'childlike.I', 'had', 'old', 'VHS', 'taped', 'copy', 'used', 'watch', 'least', 'twice', 'year', 'pulled', 'out', 'not', 'too', 'long', 'ago', 'guess', 'somewhere', 'way', 'somebody', 'decided', 'tape', 'porno', 'Oh', 'was', 'plenty', 'pumping', 'going', 'was', ""n't"", 'iron', 'were', ""n't"", 'gym', 'bought', 'new', 'DVD', 'copy', ""'m"", 'glad', 'did', 'excellent', 'version.Pumping', 'Iron', ""n't"", 'just', 'movie', 'muscleheads', 'indepth', 'look', 'human', 'soul', 'least', 'way', 'look', 'get', 'see', 'what', 'guys', 'do', 'what', 'do', 'very', 'enlightening', ""'re"", 'such', 'interesting', 'group', 'people', 'are', ""n't"", 'So', 'diverse', 'yet', 'so', 'similar.I', 'am', 'sure', 'alien', 'beings', 'have', 'secured', 'own', 'copy', 'DVD', 'are', 'trying', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'human', 'race', 'Maybe', 'why', 'have', ""n't"", 'contacted', 'awhile', 'Maybe', ""'re"", 'just', 'scared', 'little', 'gurly-men', 'anyway', 'rent', 'buy', 'copy', 'film', 'see', 'Arnold', 'best.Peace', 'Blessings']",N/A

Arnold has charisma in rare form as he showdowns with Lou who is adversary of sorts.  Split shots create the story of the two's run at Olympia.  Lou is a simpleton, but a monster and is potrayed as the underdog...who never reaches the threshold of victory, as it belongs to Arnold regardless.

Not only does its star make ""Pumping Iron"" a massive seventies docudrama, but this docudrama made its star a massive actor. Based on the book of the same title, director George Butler asked the then twenty-eight year old, five times winning Mr. Olympia, to help them shine light on the world of bodybuilding, a subject that had been perceived as something to do with men with inferiority complexes, with advertisements for muscle gain programs relegated to the back pages of comic books, now bodybuilding technique had matured enough to offer true athletic ability with a large potential for discovering new things about the human body that where not considered possible before. Schwarzenegger, an Austrian immigrant, brought the film crew to ""Gold's Gym"" in sunny California to capture him in training, yet instead of showing us boring set after set of workout repetitions, ""Pumping Iron"" follows the competition in the guise of various bodybuilding characters, from the family man, Mike Katz, with a chest like a truck, to the curly haired symmetrical powerhouse bad guy, Ken Waller, who likes to hide a bodybuilder's T-shirt on the day of the competition to psyche him out during the Mr. Universe finals. The central story revolves around Arnold's ego, the size of which even NASA could not launch into space, and a shy deaf kid from New York, Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk in the television series) who idolizes Arnold and with the help of his domineering father trains to take the title away from his hero. The preparation for the 1975 Mr. Olympia, to be held in Pretoria, which was to be the first ever multiracial sports event in South Africa, is portrayed by moving back and forth between the luminous veils of the west coast and the industrial compound of New York City where we see the men of bronze pushing themselves to the limit by lifting weights that would be enough to fall a horse. All the big names of the bodybuilding world are here - Reg Park, Roger Callard, Ed Corney, Serge Nubret, Robbie Robinson and Joe Weider. Arnold's `little' partner, Franco Columbu, pulls a number of stunts like lifting a car and blowing up a hot water bottle like a balloon, while the Austrian Oak talks about how the feeling of getting pumped is like cumming with a woman, debates his passion by explaining how he didn't turn up to his father's funeral because he was too busy training or decides to smoke a joint on camera, all of which are controversial Arnie topics till this very day, but the important `thirty years later' DVD extras do shed light on some of these moments, along with important questions about steroid abuse. The highlight of ""Pumping Iron"" is when Arnold pulls off a Mr. Olympia stage shift where he pumps himself up like a puffer fish... you have never seen Arnold this big before, nor will we again. This is the movie that spawned numerous gyms across the globe so that people could get into shape. Coupled with Arnold's book ""Encylopedia of Modern Bodybuiling"", this DVD certainly is the modern bodybuilder's #1 motivation tool and the bodybuilding docudrama that reshaped Hollywood.",5,THE Bodybuilding Docudrama that Reshaped Hollywood,1132185600,"11 17, 2005",2005,3396,"['opening', 'scene', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'workout', 'buddy', 'Franco', 'Columbu', 'taking', 'ballet', 'classes', 'improve', 'competitive', 'stage', 'presentation', 'bit', 'as', 'interesting', 'rest', 'things', 'have', 'heard', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'then', 'more', 'Not', 'only', 'star', 'make', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'massive', 'seventies', 'docudrama', 'docudrama', 'made', 'star', 'massive', 'actor', 'Based', 'book', 'same', 'title', 'director', 'George', 'Butler', 'asked', 'then', 'twenty-eight', 'year', 'old', 'five', 'times', 'winning', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'help', 'shine', 'light', 'world', 'bodybuilding', 'subject', 'had', 'been', 'perceived', 'something', 'do', 'men', 'inferiority', 'complexes', 'advertisements', 'muscle', 'gain', 'programs', 'relegated', 'back', 'pages', 'comic', 'books', 'now', 'bodybuilding', 'technique', 'had', 'matured', 'enough', 'offer', 'true', 'athletic', 'ability', 'large', 'potential', 'discovering', 'new', 'things', 'human', 'body', 'where', 'not', 'considered', 'possible', 'before', 'Schwarzenegger', 'Austrian', 'immigrant', 'brought', 'film', 'crew', 'Gold', 'Gym', 'sunny', 'California', 'capture', 'training', 'yet', 'instead', 'showing', 'boring', 'set', 'set', 'workout', 'repetitions', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'competition', 'guise', 'various', 'bodybuilding', 'characters', 'family', 'man', 'Mike', 'Katz', 'chest', 'truck', 'curly', 'haired', 'symmetrical', 'powerhouse', 'bad', 'guy', 'Ken', 'Waller', 'who', 'hide', 'bodybuilder', 'T-shirt', 'day', 'competition', 'psyche', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Universe', 'finals', 'central', 'story', 'revolves', 'Arnold', 'ego', 'size', 'even', 'NASA', 'could', 'not', 'launch', 'space', 'shy', 'deaf', 'kid', 'New', 'York', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Incredible', 'Hulk', 'television', 'series', 'who', 'Arnold', 'help', 'domineering', 'father', 'trains', 'take', 'title', 'away', 'hero', 'preparation', '1975', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'be', 'held', 'Pretoria', 'was', 'be', 'first', 'ever', 'multiracial', 'sports', 'event', 'South', 'Africa', 'portrayed', 'moving', 'back', 'forth', 'luminous', 'veils', 'west', 'coast', 'industrial', 'compound', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'see', 'men', 'bronze', 'pushing', 'limit', 'lifting', 'weights', 'would', 'be', 'enough', 'fall', 'horse', 'big', 'names', 'bodybuilding', 'world', 'are', 'here', 'Reg', 'Park', 'Roger', 'Callard', 'Ed', 'Corney', 'Serge', 'Nubret', 'Robbie', 'Robinson', 'Joe', 'Weider', 'Arnold', 'little', 'partner', 'Franco', 'Columbu', 'number', 'stunts', 'lifting', 'car', 'blowing', 'up', 'hot', 'water', 'bottle', 'balloon', 'Austrian', 'Oak', 'talks', 'how', 'feeling', 'getting', 'pumped', 'cumming', 'woman', 'passion', 'explaining', 'how', 'did', ""n't"", 'turn', 'up', 'father', 'funeral', 'was', 'too', 'busy', 'training', 'decides', 'smoke', 'joint', 'camera', 'are', 'controversial', 'Arnie', 'topics', 'till', 'very', 'day', 'important', 'thirty', 'years', 'later', 'DVD', 'extras', 'do', 'shed', 'light', 'moments', 'important', 'questions', 'steroid', 'abuse', 'highlight', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'when', 'Arnold', 'off', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'stage', 'shift', 'where', 'puffer', 'fish', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'Arnold', 'big', 'before', 'will', 'again', 'movie', 'spawned', 'numerous', 'gyms', 'globe', 'people', 'could', 'get', 'shape', 'Coupled', 'Arnold', 'book', 'Encylopedia', 'Modern', 'Bodybuiling', 'DVD', 'certainly', 'modern', 'bodybuilder', '1', 'motivation', 'tool', 'bodybuilding', 'docudrama', 'reshaped', 'Hollywood']",N/A

Ferrigno ""firehouse444""","[72, 73]","The 1970's was definitely the halcyon days of international bodybuilding...two forward thinking brothers, Ben & Joe Weider, took a novelty sport, propelled it to stellar heights, built a publishing & business empire and gave the phrase ""pumping iron"" respectability and recognition worldwide. However, the Weider's would never have been as successful, if it had not been for a brash, young, quick talking bodybuilder from Austria (with a super hero, chiselled physique ) named Arnold Schwarzenneger who was the ""golden boy"" of bodybuilding's golden age.This tremendous documentary primarily follows four elite bodybuilders in their lead up to the 1975 Mr Universe & Mr Olympia titles in Pretoria, South Africa. Mike Katz, Ken Waller, Lou ""The Hulk"" Ferrigno & Arnold Schwarzenneger are all shown training hard, posing down and attempting to psych each other out in the quest for the sport's top prizes. Also featured in the film are some of the other key identities from bodybuilding in the 1970's...Ed Corney, ""The Black Prince"" Robbie Robinson, Danny ""The Giant Killer"" Padilla, ""The Sardinian Superman"" Franco Colombu, Frenchman Serge Nubret & Frank Zane. George Butler's intriguing film is based around the book of the same name by fitness author Charles Gaines, who also wrote the novel ""Stay Hungry"" that was filmed a year earlier to ""Pumping Iron"" with a young Schwarzenneger as bodybuiler, Joe Santos !Butler's probing camera focus's very much on the psychological aspects of the sport and much of ""Pumping Iron's"" running time is shown on the behind the scenes issues and mental preparation by the athletes and all important confidence boosting by their family and peers. Especially interesting is the intensely close relationship between ex-NYC cop Matty Ferrigno and his shy 24 year old son Lou, as the two ferociously train and methodically prepare to topple untouchable Arnold off his perch as the world's number one bodybuilder. However, we soon see why Arnold achieved the heights of fame and numerous titles, as he psychologically dismantles his opponents confidence and rattles their faith with his laid back & unnerving comments on their physiques !Although ""Pumping Iron"" looks a little dated (lots of flared pants and bad haircuts), it is easily the best documentary ever made on competitive bodybuilding and is still compulsive viewing for anyone genuinely interested in one of the oldest, and often most mis-understood sports on the planet !",5,Brilliant sports documentary on body building's Golden Age.,1055980800,"06 19, 2003",2003,2463,"['1970', 'was', 'definitely', 'halcyon', 'days', 'international', 'bodybuilding', 'two', 'forward', 'thinking', 'brothers', 'Ben', 'Joe', 'Weider', 'took', 'novelty', 'sport', 'propelled', 'stellar', 'heights', 'built', 'publishing', 'business', 'empire', 'gave', 'phrase', 'pumping', 'iron', 'respectability', 'recognition', 'worldwide', 'However', 'Weider', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'been', 'successful', 'had', 'not', 'been', 'brash', 'young', 'quick', 'talking', 'bodybuilder', 'Austria', 'super', 'hero', 'chiselled', 'physique', 'named', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenneger', 'who', 'was', 'golden', 'boy', 'bodybuilding', 'golden', 'age.This', 'tremendous', 'documentary', 'primarily', 'four', 'elite', 'bodybuilders', 'lead', '1975', 'Mr', 'Universe', 'Mr', 'Olympia', 'titles', 'Pretoria', 'South', 'Africa', 'Mike', 'Katz', 'Ken', 'Waller', 'Lou', 'Hulk', 'Ferrigno', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenneger', 'are', 'shown', 'training', 'hard', 'posing', 'down', 'attempting', 'psych', 'other', 'out', 'quest', 'sport', 'top', 'prizes', 'Also', 'featured', 'film', 'are', 'other', 'key', 'identities', 'bodybuilding', '1970', 'Ed', 'Corney', 'Black', 'Prince', 'Robbie', 'Robinson', 'Danny', 'Giant', 'Killer', 'Padilla', 'Sardinian', 'Superman', 'Franco', 'Colombu', 'Frenchman', 'Serge', 'Nubret', 'Frank', 'Zane', 'George', 'Butler', 'intriguing', 'film', 'based', 'book', 'same', 'name', 'fitness', 'author', 'Charles', 'Gaines', 'who', 'also', 'wrote', 'novel', 'Stay', 'Hungry', 'was', 'filmed', 'year', 'earlier', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'young', 'Schwarzenneger', 'bodybuiler', 'Joe', 'Santos', 'Butler', 'probing', 'camera', 'focus', 'very', 'much', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'sport', 'much', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'running', 'time', 'shown', 'scenes', 'issues', 'mental', 'preparation', 'athletes', 'important', 'confidence', 'boosting', 'family', 'peers', 'Especially', 'interesting', 'intensely', 'close', 'relationship', 'ex-NYC', 'cop', 'Matty', 'Ferrigno', 'shy', '24', 'year', 'old', 'son', 'Lou', 'two', 'ferociously', 'train', 'methodically', 'prepare', 'topple', 'untouchable', 'Arnold', 'off', 'perch', 'world', 'number', 'one', 'bodybuilder', 'However', 'soon', 'see', 'why', 'Arnold', 'achieved', 'heights', 'fame', 'numerous', 'titles', 'psychologically', 'opponents', 'confidence', 'rattles', 'faith', 'laid', 'back', 'unnerving', 'comments', 'physiques', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'little', 'dated', 'lots', 'flared', 'pants', 'bad', 'haircuts', 'easily', 'best', 'documentary', 'ever', 'made', 'competitive', 'bodybuilding', 'still', 'compulsive', 'viewing', 'anyone', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'one', 'oldest', 'often', 'most', 'mis-understood', 'sports', 'planet']",N/A
319591,A39GW5CBWTIWAZ,6302548195,Phil S.,"[2, 2]","I don't recall if ""Rocky I"" came first, but ""Pumping Iron"" is anothe period piece which really connected with the public. With Rocky Marciano/Charles Atlas/Sly Stallone images in our head, we wondered if we too could join a gym and go a few rounds....It's interesting to watch this low-key oddball with 2008 vision. Body-building was not really considered a competitive ""sport"" to be taken seriously and it had no firm infrastructure in the marketplace. The workout settings were pretty funky. Just like Rocky's.I'm not sure if the Governor formerly known as the Bodybuilder had the most beneficial technique (against present day standards), but still it was all huffing and pufing and bumping and grinding with loose weights. What was ""nautilus"" then?There are many poignant scenes with Lou Ferrigno and his Father, who apparently was included in the filming because he was lens-friendly and had a commanding presence, which fit right in, as it's been suggested that Lou was considered ""learning disabled"" by some, and so his family was around to remind people that he may not express himself at the level he thinks. But Schwarzenegger's visit to his family strikes me as somewhat condescending and manipulative - as if his mission was to psychologically dominate prior to a potential *physical* domination.The big star (though of course Lou went on to fame on TV) was Arnold, who is a dominating presence, whose sense of humour and perceptiveness provides an interesting counterpoint to the corporeal setting.  There's also something arrogant about him, but a successful athlete shows his ""game face"" and uses it for leverage...and attention.It is revealing when AS drops his poses and says at the end...I'm through folks. It was on to Washington (?). (By way of California and Massachusetts and California).The extras are interesting for a while - apparently filmed around 2001 - but somehow they diminish the actual documentary.

Nobody ever hid Katz's t-shirt, for example - the scene with Waller saying he was going to hide it actually was shot well after the competition where he lost it.

It will inspire you to work harder, to pursue your physical fitness goals.  Watching these mammoth men training is both eye opening and entertaining.Seeing Arnold in his prime, and Lou Ferrigno as an up-and-coming star in the sport, is fascinating.  The bodybuilders of that era, unlike the monsters of today, had the right combination of size and definition. They also were pioneers and introduced a lot of training and dietary techniques still used 30 years later.  Pumping Iron is a glimpse into that era.Lou Ferrigno said in the 25th anniversary edition that he did not like the film after it came out because of how it portrayed him.  The film, in my view, actually paints him in a great light.  In it we see a 24 year old kid from Brooklyn, hungry for his dream, doggedly trying to reach the top of his sport and cast mighty Arnold down from his throne.  Arnold is the Muhammad Ali of the sport and that's obvious in the movie; he would try to get in the heads of Ferrigno and his competitors.  Ferrigno is the everyman bodybuilder.  He comes off as kind, gentle, down-to-earth but very determined.  I had no idea what a great guy he was and is until I saw this movie.The anniversary edition's extras and outtakes are great.

It really revealed the behind the scenes of bodybuilding through the eyes of the world's most famous if not the greatest muscle-god Arnold Schwarzenegger. This film has it's longevity since it was released in the '70s, and it will sure continue to capture anyone who has a curiosity or passion for building a fabulous body.In this film, we get to see the lives and daily workout sessions of Arnold and numerous other professional bodybuilders training at the gym in preparation for the world's top competitions include Mr. Olympia and Mr. Universe. Arnold set the record for having won the Mr. Olympia title more than 5 times straight, and he was about to resign from all competitions. He talks about the physical and psychological aspects of bodybuilding. It's NO PAIN, NO GAIN! when it comes to weight training. We get to see the expressions on the faces of all the guys when they are working out madly.The supporting cast include other famous bodybuilders like Lou Ferrigno and Frank Columbu who were rivals to Arnold at the competition scene.Ferrigno was very driven to take over the title from Arnold, but he didn't win, and he was as furious as his The Hulk character. Columbu, the Italian, though relatively short in height, but his body was the most perfect of all.Although most of the guys in this film were not as keen on their image(grooming) like today's bodybuilders, they were more devoted to the definition of muscular bodies.",5,"No Pain, No Gain!",1111190400,"03 19, 2005",2005,1564,"['recreational', 'bodybuilder', 'must', 'say', 'Pumping', 'Iron', 'very', 'inspirational', 'informative', 'funny', 'documentary', 'really', 'revealed', 'scenes', 'bodybuilding', 'eyes', 'world', 'most', 'famous', 'not', 'greatest', 'muscle-god', 'Arnold', 'Schwarzenegger', 'film', 'longevity', 'was', 'released', ""'70s"", 'will', 'sure', 'continue', 'capture', 'anyone', 'who', 'curiosity', 'passion', 'building', 'fabulous', 'body.In', 'film', 'get', 'see', 'lives', 'daily', 'workout', 'sessions', 'Arnold', 'numerous', 'other', 'professional', 'bodybuilders', 'training', 'gym', 'preparation', 'world', 'top', 'competitions', 'include', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'Mr.', 'Universe', 'Arnold', 'set', 'record', 'having', 'won', 'Mr.', 'Olympia', 'more', '5', 'times', 'straight', 'was', 'about', 'resign', 'competitions', 'physical', 'psychological', 'aspects', 'bodybuilding', 'NO', 'PAIN', 'NO', 'GAIN', 'when', 'weight', 'training', 'get', 'see', 'expressions', 'guys', 'when', 'are', 'working', 'out', 'madly.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'include', 'other', 'famous', 'bodybuilders', 'Lou', 'Ferrigno', 'Frank', 'Columbu', 'who', 'were', 'rivals', 'Arnold', 'competition', 'scene.Ferrigno', 'was', 'very', 'driven', 'take', 'over', 'title', 'Arnold', 'did', ""n't"", 'win', 'was', 'as', 'furious', 'Hulk', 'character', 'Columbu', 'Italian', 'though', 'relatively', 'short', 'height', 'body', 'was', 'most', 'perfect', 'most', 'guys', 'film', 'were', 'not', 'keen', 'image', 'grooming', 'today', 'bodybuilders', 'were', 'more', 'devoted', 'definition', 'muscular', 'bodies']",N/A
