I watched Beauty Shop at home with my mom and we both laughed. I took it down my sisters' house and laughed even harder. If you're not the type that take movies seriously and just want a good laugh, you will like this. If you're one to look at movies, especially if you're African America, and will say things like, ""This makes us look real bad."" No it's not for you. One thing I've learned is that life is too short to spend it disecting things when movies are for ENTERTAINMENT. Some will make you laugh, some will make you cry, some will also make you evaluate yourself (now these are the ones to take serious especially if it makes a positive effect on you). If you want to laugh and be entertained where you can just relax and enjoy the moment without being serious - watch this play. That's why I'm on here now to purchase it when it comes out Feb. 14th. I'm putting my order in now!!!",5,I love it - it is very funny!!!!!!!,1139702400,"02 12, 2006",2006,1050,"['work', 'video', 'store', 'part-time', 'get', 'watch', 'movies', 'hit', 'floor', 'can', 'let', 'customers', 'know', 'information', 'movies', 'when', 'ask', 'watched', 'Beauty', 'Shop', 'home', 'mom', 'laughed', 'took', 'down', 'sisters', 'house', 'laughed', 'even', 'harder', ""'re"", 'not', 'type', 'take', 'movies', 'seriously', 'just', 'want', 'good', 'laugh', 'will', 'like', ""'re"", 'one', 'look', 'movies', 'especially', ""'re"", 'African', 'America', 'will', 'say', 'things', 'look', 'real', 'bad', 'No', 'not', 'One', 'thing', ""'ve"", 'learned', 'life', 'too', 'short', 'spend', 'disecting', 'things', 'when', 'movies', 'are', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'will', 'make', 'laugh', 'will', 'make', 'cry', 'will', 'also', 'make', 'evaluate', 'now', 'are', 'ones', 'take', 'serious', 'especially', 'positive', 'effect', 'want', 'laugh', 'be', 'entertained', 'where', 'can', 'just', 'relax', 'enjoy', 'moment', 'being', 'serious', 'watch', 'play', 'why', ""'m"", 'here', 'now', 'purchase', 'when', 'out', 'Feb.', '14th', ""'m"", 'putting', 'order', 'now']",N/A

This movie tries hard to give that experience by showing reaction shots of the audience, but it's not the same.Some stage shows are open enough and large enough to translate well into a filmed narration without changing sets or adapting.  This isn't one of them.  In fact, even as a play alone it's pretty bad.  The characters are one-dimensional caricatures, the script is lousy, most of the acting is pretty bad, and it doesn't really have a storyline... really...The only part that's even remotely interesting is the scene where Big Mama wears the zebra suit and the cast just loses control and completely breaks the fourth wall.  Yet even still that moment would be a lot more special and a lot more endearing had I actually been there than have to rely on shoddily shot video editing to tell me where to look.All in all, it was a pretty ridiculous experience, not worth even the price of a rental.--PolarisDiB",1,Even as a play alone it's pretty bad,1142208000,"03 13, 2006",2006,1018,"['What', 'point', 'have', 'particular', 'fondness', 'theatre', 'best', 'part', 'theatre', 'being', 'there', 'movie', 'hard', 'give', 'experience', 'showing', 'reaction', 'shots', 'audience', 'not', 'same.Some', 'stage', 'shows', 'are', 'open', 'enough', 'large', 'enough', 'translate', 'well', 'filmed', 'narration', 'changing', 'sets', 'adapting', ""n't"", 'one', 'fact', 'even', 'play', 'alone', 'pretty', 'bad', 'characters', 'are', 'one-dimensional', 'caricatures', 'script', 'lousy', 'most', 'acting', 'pretty', 'bad', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'storyline', 'really', 'only', 'part', 'even', 'remotely', 'interesting', 'scene', 'where', 'Big', 'Mama', 'zebra', 'suit', 'cast', 'just', 'control', 'completely', 'breaks', 'fourth', 'wall', 'even', 'still', 'moment', 'would', 'be', 'lot', 'more', 'special', 'lot', 'more', 'endearing', 'had', 'actually', 'been', 'there', 'have', 'rely', 'shoddily', 'shot', 'video', 'editing', 'tell', 'where', 'look.All', 'was', 'pretty', 'ridiculous', 'experience', 'not', 'worth', 'even', 'price', 'rental.', 'PolarisDiB']",N/A
