It offers some good, funny comedy brought to you courtesy of the Wayans brothers; with Shawn and Marlon Wayans taking center stage as the main performers in the movie, dressed in drag, and Keenen Ivory Wayans taking over duties as director.This movie is the most humorous when the two guys are dressed as women and are trying their best to act the part. Particularly funny is when the guys suddenly forget they are men and let their true voices and mannerisms creep out from behind the white masks. Another funny part of the film occurs when a man tries to ""hit on"" one of the ""girls"" not knowing she is really a he.But there are some flaws with this film, in spite of the laughs. First of all, the plot isn't very good and it's full of holes. The guys disguise themselves as women to foil a kidnapping plot of two blonde haired beauties, but the plot is so empty that viewers will find themselves not really caring. I watched the movie a couple of times, and it made no real difference to me how it ended. Second, there is an element of stupidity with this movie because, even though anyone can tell these two guys are not really women, the other actors and actresses in the film carry on like they cannot tell.Another thing that might bother some viewers is the use of stereotypes and racial talk.

I thought this was going to be a derogatory movie that berated white women. I finally caught this on TV last night and I laughed my butt off. This movie is not at all what you might expect. It is truly great comedy. If you like movies like ""Shallow Hal"" and "" Miss Congeniality"", you will probably enjoy this one. A bit irreverent about young high society ladys, but done in a way that deserves much more than a look. I've been a big fan of the Wayan's since their ""In Living Color"" TV series. This comedy will be on my shelf quite soon next to ""Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle"" and ""Kung Fu Hustle"". This breaks the typical comedy mold with some outragious ideas.It strikes a new chord of comedy that is bold yet familiar. Bold in it isn't like any other movie, but with a taste of a familiar comedic style like Saturday Night's ""A Night at the Roxbury"" by having a great cast and comedic style that makes it seem almost familiar to previous Wayan's works. The story centers on two black male FBI agents put in charge of guarding two white rich society girls from being kidnapped while they are on a weekend trip to a model show. When the two girls faces are slightly injured they refuse to go and the FBI agents must improvise to make sure they appear at the show. What ensues is borderline hysterical comedy. Excellent comedy writing, great acting, and some fantastic make-up make this a joy to watch. The soundtrack is super as well and would be well worth having.

It could be funny, smart, and make fun of white people in good taste. However, it looks unfunny, dumb, and myself being white, painfully racist. I am a huge fan of black culture and of rap music and of about anything else ""African-American that you can put your finger on. But after viewing the new series Method and Red, which was very funny and clever, I can't but feel a bit hurt by these racist trends that are surprisingly being ignited by black people. I guess it kinda serves us right. Whites were terribly cruel to African-Americans back in the past few decades and centuries? Maybe the blacks, the people I support so much, are looking to punish us through humor as we punished them through slavery.Believe me, I will see this movie, and I hope that I am wrong about my predictions.

Maybe it's because of his recent rise from ""Everybody Hates Chris"", a bit role in ""Click"", and the Old Spice commercials, but I kind of like his character as a wealthy basketball player who's hitting on one on the Wilson sisters, who's really Marlon Wayans in disguise.  Seeing him go nuts trying to win a 'girl's' heart as well as him singing a Vanessa Carlton song was entertaining, and outside that one scene regarding a lot of farting, he's pleasant to watch.Although, I might be making such a statement as a desperate attempt to find anything positive about this film.  ""White Chicks"" is the type of film in which one looks at the movie cover and realize this is a bad idea.  The jokes are stale, predictable, and a little bit offensive such as the first scene where the Wayans bros. dress up as Hispanic clerks and overblown their acting for far too long; some parts of the humor rely on being gross, which has never been good.  The make-up on the fake heiresses is monstrous and the characters are too dense to notice the disguises, even the FBI who should've easily noticed the difference between the fake and real heiresses, the FBI that Shaun and Marlon's characters are working under and part of a secret operation that their superiors didn't know; also, I find it hard to be that the brothers, when normal, can reapply such an elaborate make-up in less than 30 seconds.  Even more insipid is the reporter, who's involved in a cliche sub-plot where Shaun Wayans' character pretends to be rich to get her attention, and she must not be good at her job if she didn't notice the blatant lies like Shaun being attacked by a guard dog in what his character called his own house.Even with such flaws, this movie manage to make an impression on me.

But this movie is not very high on the must see list.I watched the commentary bonus feature after watching the film. I found out the whole conception of White Chicks was based on Shawn Wayans seeing Paris Hilton in a magazine with here little Tinkerbell. He then brought that idea to his brother Keenen Ivory.  This idea passed the family input and White Chicks was born.  Watching the Wayans family trying to pull this transformation off was like a real life rectum logy. (Very painful and discomforting for a long, long time.) This movie has nothing new in the comedy genre besides the obvious black to white and male to female jokes.I remember Damon, Shawn and Keenen Ivory performing in the classic career launching TV show ""In Living Color."" Keene Ivory created In Living Color. Who could forget Homey D. Clown and Fire Marshall Bill. White Chicks is forgettable in every aspect. Keenen Ivory's short script writing and character development was dead on in those unforgettable In Living Color skits. Can we get some of that gut busting laughter back again?The one bright spot in White Chicks is the comedic timing and ad-lib of Marlon Wayans.

Kim,"[1, 2]","NOTE: This review refers to the unrated version.I guess the Wayans Brothers didn't realize that the ""men in drag"" premise is now old and tiresome. I mean, take a look at Some Like It Hot, Tootsie, or even The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The same premise was used, but plenty of brand new elements were added. White Chicks also has some new elements (placing two African-Americans under lots of makeup, and turning them into blond female teenagers), but it just doesn't work. The disguises of both Shawn & Marlon Wayans are so grotesquely ugly that that it's more painful than funny to look at. Just take a look at the front side of this DVD case, and try not to cringe at the mere sight of it. But it's not just the horrible makeup, but it's also the unfunny jokes that make this movie a big disappointment. There were only few jokes that made me laugh; those that were unfunny felt very forced, and these make up 109 out of the entire 110 minutes of the film. The Wayans Brothers are much better than this. They've made the first Scary Movie & Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood, both of which I enjoyed immensely.

Did it keep us from enjoying The Mask? Is it believable for a boogey man to kill teenagers in their dreams who live on Elm Street? Did this stop A Nightmare on Elm Street from being a good scary movie?Credibility only matters in actions and dramas: not in comedies and horrors. The only obligation of a comedy is to be funny, not to be artful or classy. This single obligation is also the reason why standards for comedies are lower than for dramas, and why comedies hardly ever get nominated for Oscars unless they are ""arty.""If you hate White Chicks because you DON'T think it's funny, fine.

847448,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,B0002VYOV8,Jason,"[0, 0]","Role-reversal, gender bending comedies are hardly original, but in a truly enlightening and entertaining edition, there is typically a cultural, sexual, or stylistic lesson.  In White Chicks, however, there is nothing redeeming or worthwhile whatsoever.Bumbling, sibling FBI agents (Shawn and Marlon Wayans) go undercover by putting on rubbery body padding, off-white paint, and contact lenses to become the Wilson sisters (a copycat movie portrayal of the Hilton sisters).  Apparently the Wilson sisters are mutants, transvestites, or perhaps hermaphrodites who look like Tori Spelling.  Either way, their appearance is as ridiculously unconvincing as the Wayans' brothers acting.  All that said, and there's no need to even go into the fact that neither of them acts feminine in any way, making the premise even more pathetic.  The fact that their friends don't even notice that the Wilson sisters transformed from beautiful, thin, young women into gawky, masculine, drag queens is outrageous, and a reason to simply ignore the rest of the movie.Even before seeing the movie you know the script.  Insert lame racial joke here, act out clich&eacute;d stereotype there.  Rich chicks can't make it to the Hamptons for whatever contrived reason and the Wayans step incognito as replacements.  I think it goes without saying, but just in case there was any doubt, there is definitely a dancing scene where people can't believe the white chicks can break it down so well.At best it's nothing more than unfunny garbage.

It's not that ""White Chicks"" is racist so much as that the movie doesn't cover new ground and, once again, chooses to embrace low-brow ""ghetto"" humor to deliver a joke. The plot is convoluted characters all stereotypes and, therefore, are easy to mock and the premise (men dressing up in drag) is tired.This classic Hollywood gimmick hasn't been successful since Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie"" came out some 20 years ago. I wonder how this is STILL considered funny to anyone over the age of 25 and particularly, to any adult who's of color? It creates a bad light for Black Americans and simply reinforces an edict to both Hollywood and the rest of America that the only way a black movie can/must be successful is in broad, cheap comedies. How many more times do we have see yet another movie explaining the black/white class dynamic for the sake of witless jokes!?! It may work for a stand-up comedian doing a six-minute bit on stage but it loses steam quick in a 90 minute movie.Seriously didn't Richard Pryor, Chris Rock and Dave Chappell cover this already and in a much more intellectual way? If ""White Chicks"" had more pathos to it, perhaps making it more satire than low-brow, I might've given it a better rating. Which is sort of a shame because the Wayans Brothers did so well with the ""Scary Movie"" franchise and their earlier movie's. Also, after seeing Marlon Wayans's deft acting in ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Ladykillers"", I had high hopes for his career and didn't expect him to go back to these types of films. I'm not saying that ""White Chicks"" needs to be another ""Lost in Translation"" but c'mon, Shawn and Marlon, how's about being a little bit clever? The irony of all this is even if it were called ""Black Chicks"" and the guys were white portraying black women, I believe it'd still suffer from the same creative problems.",2,Okay.......Then What........?,1136505600,"01 6, 2006",2006,1911,"['had', 'chance', 'watch', 'movie', 'thought', 'was', 'alright', 'not', 'White', 'Chicks', 'racist', 'so', 'much', 'movie', ""n't"", 'cover', 'new', 'ground', 'once', 'again', 'embrace', 'low-brow', 'ghetto', 'humor', 'deliver', 'joke', 'plot', 'convoluted', 'characters', 'stereotypes', 'therefore', 'are', 'easy', 'mock', 'premise', 'men', 'dressing', 'up', 'drag', 'tired.This', 'classic', 'Hollywood', 'gimmick', ""n't"", 'been', 'successful', 'Dustin', 'Hoffman', 'Tootsie', 'came', '20', 'years', 'ago', 'wonder', 'how', 'STILL', 'considered', 'funny', 'anyone', 'age', '25', 'particularly', 'adult', 'who', 'color', 'bad', 'light', 'Black', 'Americans', 'simply', 'edict', 'Hollywood', 'rest', 'America', 'only', 'way', 'black', 'movie', 'can/must', 'be', 'successful', 'broad', 'cheap', 'comedies', 'How', 'many', 'more', 'times', 'do', 'have', 'see', 'yet', 'movie', 'explaining', 'black/white', 'class', 'dynamic', 'sake', 'witless', 'jokes', 'may', 'work', 'stand-up', 'comedian', 'doing', 'six-minute', 'bit', 'stage', 'steam', 'quick', '90', 'minute', 'movie.Seriously', 'did', ""n't"", 'Richard', 'Pryor', 'Chris', 'Rock', 'Dave', 'Chappell', 'cover', 'already', 'much', 'more', 'intellectual', 'way', 'White', 'Chicks', 'had', 'more', 'pathos', 'perhaps', 'making', 'more', 'satire', 'low-brow', 'might', ""'ve"", 'given', 'better', 'rating', 'Which', 'sort', 'shame', 'Wayans', 'Brothers', 'did', 'so', 'well', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'franchise', 'earlier', 'movie', 'Also', 'seeing', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'deft', 'acting', 'Requiem', 'Dream', 'Ladykillers', 'had', 'high', 'hopes', 'career', 'did', ""n't"", 'expect', 'go', 'back', 'types', 'films', ""'m"", 'not', 'saying', 'White', 'Chicks', 'be', 'Lost', 'Translation', ""c'mon"", 'Shawn', 'Marlon', 'how', 'being', 'little', 'bit', 'clever', 'irony', 'even', 'were', 'called', 'Black', 'Chicks', 'guys', 'were', 'white', 'portraying', 'black', 'women', 'believe', ""'d"", 'still', 'suffer', 'same', 'creative', 'problems']",N/A

847455,A38KB4FUP2MQX5,B0002VYOV8,John,"[1, 3]","I'm a fan of the Wayans brothers - loved Don't Be A Menace and generally liked the Scary Movie series - but this was a real let-down.  One of the curious things about their movies is there's usually an undercurrent of sexual ambivalence there.  In this movie that's ruthlessly shut down from the get-go, so in the first scene in which the guys appear in drag as the white chicks, when some other guy makes a pass at them they immediately break character & turn macho because they're so appalled by the idea such a thing would happen.  Since they've disguised themselves as (supposedly) pretty girls their reaction to what was inevitably going to happen makes them painfully dumb and it's hard to care about dumb characters.I happened to finally catch up with Zoolander the other day and it shows that you can combine a thriller plot with comedy to good effect.  Here the rather po-faced thriller element totally fails to mesh with the comedy, & the conventional romance sub-plot is a yawn.  I don't mind things being ludicrous, but they must have some sort of internal logic to them.  At one point there's a dance-off competition where our heroes throw down with all manner of fancy moves.  Who knew that all FBI agents were such good dancers?I actually liked the fact they looked kind of hideous in drag & make-up but still everyone believed they were the real girls.  But even there construction was slack: in a scene where one agent is trying on a dress one of the real girls comes into the dressing room to help 'her' change.  The real girl wrenches the guy's underpants up into a thong style, leading to him whooping in pain.  What's slack is that she doesn't notice that this 'white chick' has a brown ass.Maybe I zoned out right at the start (a very unfunny stakeout-gone-wrong sequence) but who was the guys' special friend who had all this amazing make-up & a team to apply it?Another example of general laziness is that the 'girls' never worry about wigs or make-up going awry (not even when break-dancing on their heads) so the suspense of being in disguise is mostly thrown away.It seems pointless to point out all the gaping holes in the plot but one example would be when one of the agents' wives thinks he is cheating on her.  Now he could tell her the truth: that he's undercover.  But instead he doesn't, leading to more senseless complications generated, I suspect, by a desire to give the sistas a slightly higher profile in the movie.This could have been a really funny film.  It could have made some sharp points about race & gender.  It could - like the Wayans brothers' other flicks - have been a fun send-up of (in this case) drag movies.  Instead it was a chore.  You know when you find that you've wandered off to the bathroom or kitchen without pausing the dvd player?  This is one of those.  I got the feeling someone came up with the idea & then imported the Wayans brothers to make it into an appealing package - promotion-wise, that is.  They are, as always, charismatic and watchable, but for me this was simply a dull film.",2,very disappointing,1130544000,"10 29, 2005",2005,3056,"[""'m"", 'fan', 'Wayans', 'brothers', 'loved', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Be', 'A', 'Menace', 'generally', 'liked', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'series', 'was', 'real', 'let-down', 'One', 'curious', 'things', 'movies', 'usually', 'undercurrent', 'sexual', 'ambivalence', 'there', 'movie', 'ruthlessly', 'shut', 'down', 'get-go', 'so', 'first', 'scene', 'guys', 'appear', 'drag', 'white', 'chicks', 'when', 'other', 'guy', 'pass', 'immediately', 'break', 'character', 'turn', 'macho', ""'re"", 'so', 'appalled', 'idea', 'thing', 'would', 'happen', ""'ve"", 'disguised', 'supposedly', 'pretty', 'girls', 'reaction', 'what', 'was', 'inevitably', 'going', 'happen', 'painfully', 'dumb', 'hard', 'care', 'dumb', 'characters.I', 'happened', 'finally', 'catch', 'up', 'Zoolander', 'other', 'day', 'can', 'combine', 'thriller', 'plot', 'comedy', 'good', 'effect', 'Here', 'rather', 'po-faced', 'thriller', 'element', 'totally', 'mesh', 'comedy', 'conventional', 'romance', 'sub-plot', 'yawn', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'things', 'being', 'ludicrous', 'must', 'have', 'sort', 'internal', 'logic', 'one', 'point', 'dance-off', 'competition', 'where', 'heroes', 'throw', 'down', 'manner', 'fancy', 'moves', 'Who', 'knew', 'FBI', 'agents', 'were', 'such', 'good', 'dancers', 'actually', 'liked', 'fact', 'looked', 'kind', 'hideous', 'drag', 'make-up', 'still', 'everyone', 'believed', 'were', 'real', 'girls', 'even', 'construction', 'was', 'slack', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'agent', 'trying', 'dress', 'one', 'real', 'girls', 'dressing', 'room', 'help', ""'her"", 'change', 'real', 'girl', 'guy', 'underpants', 'up', 'thong', 'style', 'leading', 'whooping', 'pain', 'What', 'slack', ""n't"", 'notice', ""'white"", 'chick', 'brown', 'ass.Maybe', 'zoned', 'out', 'right', 'start', 'very', 'unfunny', 'stakeout-gone-wrong', 'sequence', 'who', 'was', 'guys', 'special', 'friend', 'who', 'had', 'amazing', 'make-up', 'team', 'apply', 'example', 'general', 'laziness', ""'girls"", 'never', 'worry', 'wigs', 'make-up', 'going', 'awry', 'not', 'even', 'when', 'break-dancing', 'heads', 'suspense', 'being', 'disguise', 'mostly', 'thrown', 'away.It', 'pointless', 'point', 'out', 'gaping', 'holes', 'plot', 'one', 'example', 'would', 'be', 'when', 'one', 'agents', 'wives', 'thinks', 'cheating', 'Now', 'could', 'tell', 'truth', 'undercover', 'instead', ""n't"", 'leading', 'more', 'senseless', 'complications', 'generated', 'suspect', 'desire', 'give', 'sistas', 'slightly', 'higher', 'profile', 'movie.This', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'funny', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'made', 'sharp', 'points', 'race', 'gender', 'could', 'Wayans', 'brothers', 'other', 'flicks', 'have', 'been', 'fun', 'send-up', 'case', 'drag', 'movies', 'Instead', 'was', 'chore', 'know', 'when', 'find', ""'ve"", 'wandered', 'bathroom', 'kitchen', 'pausing', 'dvd', 'player', 'one', 'got', 'feeling', 'someone', 'came', 'up', 'idea', 'then', 'imported', 'Wayans', 'brothers', 'make', 'appealing', 'package', 'promotion-wise', 'are', 'always', 'charismatic', 'watchable', 'was', 'simply', 'dull', 'film']",N/A

The plot is convulted,the characters all sterotypes and,therefore, are easy to mock and the premise(men dressing up in drag)is tired. This classic Hollywood gimmick hasn't been successful since Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie""came out some 20 years ago.As a black man, ""White Chicks""offends me in the same way that ""Soul Plane""did: let's all make fun of the white people and exaggerate the ghetto lifestyle. How is this STILL considered funny to anyone over the age of 25 and particularly,to any adult whose of color? It creates a bad light for Black Americans and simply reinforces an edict to both Hollywood and the rest of America that the only way a black movie can/must be successful is in broad,cheap comedies. How many more times do we have see yet another movie explaining the black/white class dynamic for the sake of witless jokes!?! It may work for a stand-up comedian doing a six-minute bit on stage but it loses steam quick in a 90 minute movie.Didn't Richard Pryor,Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle cover this already and in a much more intellectual way? If ""White Chicks""had more pathos to it,perhaps making it more satire than low-brow, I might've given it a better rating. Which is sort of a shame because the Wayans Brothers did so well with the ""Scary Movie""franchise and their earlier movie""Don't Drink Juice..."" . However,I expect low-brow humor there as both those films were strictly based on parody. Also,after seeing Marlon Wayans's deft acting in ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Ladykillers"",I had high hopes for his career and didn't expect him to go back to unfunny films like this.I'm not saying that ""White Chicks""needs to be another ""Lost in Translation"" but.c'mon,Shawn and Marlon,how's about being a little bit clever?

Two F.B.I. agents whose jobs are on the line go undercover (without their boss's knowledge!!) as wealthy, blonde debutantes.  The agents hope to thwart a kidnapping attempt on the girls.  The agents hang out in the Hamptons, turning the youth scene upside down and ensuring the scene will never be the same.  Of the agents is single, the other married.  The single one pursues a pretty reporter, while the married one's wife is hot on his trail, convinced he is cheating on her.The Wayans are at their very best while portraying the girls.  They have the accents and mannerisms down pat, and one of them has the most hilarious laugh.  I love how the ""girls"" form genuine friendships with some of the non-snooty Hampton girls.  They even teach a rich girl to value herself as more than a booty call and stop being a doormat for this worthless rich guy.  Out of makeup, the brothers are wooden and poor actors, all dialouge sounding scripted and rehearsed with no real feeling.  When emotional scenes come on, this horrible canned music comes on that is totally out of place and really makes those scenes stink!!!I love slapstick, but about 30% of the jokes were so vulgar they were insufferable to sit through.

At first I thought it was sporadically funny but at second look its pretty funny and is the last of the funny Wayans Brothers we knew.Two disgraced FBI agents go way undercover in an effort to protect hotel heiresses the Wilson Sisters from a kidnapping plot. These two also go through a lot of hijinks involving keeping up the charade as well as dealing with nosy girlfriends as well as the real heiresses' archenemies.Funny Scene#1: The beginning where Marcus was in the shop trying to pass himself as as Hispanic was pretty funny. Especially when he broke singing Guantanamera.Funny Scene#2: The scene where Marcus is in the car with Latrell and he breaks out into song had me laughing till I was breathless.Funny Scene#3: The date scene with Marcus and Latrell is the funniest part of the movie hands down. Have you ever met a guy so oblivious and desperate that his desperation matches Wanda's desperation off of In Living Color? I mean I had to hold back the laughter just to watch the rest of the scene! Funny Scene#4: The department store scene is not too far behind when you talk about the funniest scenes in the movie. There were some pretty clever and not subtle jabs at the insecurities women have about their weight. Sure it was over-the-top but remember this is a comedy.Funny Scene#5: The dance-off scene in the club was hilarious. Watching those girls shake their flat rear ends then to watch them getting disgraced by White Chicks duo on the dance floor was too funny for words.Funny Scene#6: Kevin gets attacked by a rottweiler. ""He's not my dog, he's family"". Lol!In conclusion If you can handle this type of comedy then go for it if not don't waste your time. To me White Chicks is laugh out loud romp and is the last of the funny Wayans Brothers movies. You think I'm kidding?

Their comedy is not for people who are sensitive to jokes about people's racial feelings.  I read some of the reviews for this film and found them to be truly stupid.  People are saying that the film is racist.  Well if you look at the history of theatre you'll find that it was racist long before the Wayans Brothers came along.  What about white actors in Black face.  Why do you think Black people went crazy when Ted Danson did that Black face bit.  How many white people have you seen play Native Americans in Westerns and why is it in every Western the Native Americans are depicted as wrong when the bottom line is Europeans came over here and took over a land they had no right to.  So before you start screaming racism when a Black person makes a film poking fun at racial feelings you need to look back and see the blood on the hands of theatrical and film productions done by white people.  Also remember that at one point Black people couldn't even get in theatres unless they were the cleaning crew.

They looked quite painful. Demon-blue contacts, and fake botox-smile faces quite frankly were scary rather than funny.

847505,A38S8RD8XOXLVS,B0002VYOV8,"SHAWN JAMES ""Amateur Film critic""","[4, 7]","With White Chicks Keenan Ivory Wayans and the Wayans Clan have shown us they've lost touch with their cinematic roots and become totally disconnected from their viewing audience. Like Robert Townsend before him did with B.A.P.S., Mr.Wayans and his clan have made the film they parodied with relish twenty years ago in Hollywood Shuffle.Shawn and Marlon Wayans are two bumbling FBI agents who screw up a drug bust. To redeem themselves, they take a case to stop some kidnappers. They go the airport to pick up two snooty rich heiresses and take them to the Hamptons. When a car accident leads to some minor facial injuries on the rich girls they insist on staying in a Manhattan hotel for corrective surgery. The guys go get made up and dress up as..White Chicks. That's what we're told. That's what they want us to believe. But only the Emperor in his new clothes would fall for that make-up. It doesn't even cover the actors in a lot of frames!As soon as the movie heads into the Hamptons the plot falls apart and the movie enters the MST3K realm of stupidity. The only way anyone could find this ""movie"" funny is by making their own jokes and crass comments about all the plotholes and story inconsistencies. I'm not even going to finish synopsizing the plot because it makes my head hurt to think about it. I just want to know: How does anyone believe these two guys are women with their broad shoulders and those rubber Michael Jackson masks? How does anyone on a crowded beach not see Shawn Wayans casually walk into a ladies cabana a ""White woman"" and come out a well-dressed black man? And in the same sequence how does Marlon wear a low-rise bikini and not one of the women notices something isn't right? How does Shawn pass off another guys' house as his own when he doesn't know where anything is? There's suspension of disbelief, but come on, no one can stretch their disbelief that far.Ugh. The acting here is HORRID. Any actor involved in this dreck should take this movie off their resume and never mention to anyone they participated in it. Ever. Shawn and Marlon aren't funny at all here. The weak gags have no-set up so the comedy duo's timing and execution are way off. Terry Crews hams it up as a basketball star with a fetish for one of the ""White Chicks"". Not his best work. Brittany Daniel looks better than she acts in this movie. The talented veteran Frankie Faison is the only one who manages to pull a decent performance out of this material. I don't remember most of the cast; the movie was so bad I want it erased from my long-term memory.This movie isn't the Wayans family in top form. Even with all six Wayans doing screenwriting, the script is a mess not fit for a home video. It's clear the Wayans didn't have any understanding about what they're writing about. Did the family do any research before setting pen to paper? Did they consult any rich women while writing this parody? There are more things to make fun of about rich women than tasteless sex jokes and stereotype Valley girl gags from twenty years ago. The young jet set is different from city to city. What's hot with Paris and Nicole in L.A. is not cool in the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard.Watching this movie I wondered what happened to the Wayans family? Twenty years ago they were masters of satire and parody that tapped the Black cultural pulse. Hollywood Shuffle, I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, In Living Color, A Low Down Dirty Shame, the Wayans Brothers, and Waynehead were brilliant pieces of Black satire that showcased the tremendous talent the family had for humor. With this movie and Little Man it seems like they've lost their way.Here's some advice to the Wayans clan: Pick Up Hollywood Shuffle, I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and A Low Down Dirty Shame. Go get the Old In Living Color tapes. Study these projects and pick apart the jokes. Take a trip back to the comedy clubs in New York. Talk to some people. Reconnect with the roots of your comedy. Take some time to craft a solid script and go back to doing the hilarious satires and parodies that made the family famous. This wacky Looney Tunes style of comedy you've been doing recently just doesn't work.Pass this waste of celluloid by. Get the Wayans' early films listed above. Or Get Some Like it Hot, or Tootsie. Both those movies are million times funnier than this one.",1,Not funny.

Yeah, it's a no brainer, but I love the Wayans anyway, so I was rooting for them before I even saw it. To me, it's just the boys laughing at the human ability to create issues out of irrelevant things like race and gender.Talented as the Wayans are, the superb Terry Crews almost steals the show as Latrell Spencer, right down to his Eighties pickup lines, robotic dancing and his singing of Vanessa Carlton's A Thousand Miles, which appears more than once in the movie. The most entertaining appearance was when the 'girls' and their three friends are heading out in an exotic open-top car and the song comes on the radio; which they sing along with, before switching to a 50 Cent rap number.Stage actress  Jennifer Carpenter again grabs the limelight in a brilliant performance as the weight/body image obsessed Lisa. The scene in which 'Shawn' is watching her change into a stunning black outfit is hilarous, but also undesrcores the point that many women who are already slim and beautiful have poor self-image due to all manner of insane social pressures.This is probably the ultimate guys dressing as gals movie in so far as it is gutsy enough to try some very experimental makeup techniques, of the kind normally reserved for Alien characters in Sci Fi movies. While the guys don't actually end up looking much like the Wilson sisters, if you can suspend your disbelief for long enough you can just enjoy the crazy events as they unfold.It's a complete BabeFest too, right down to the inevitable Bad Girls played by the stunning Jaime King and Brittany Daniel.

Marshall,"[1, 6]","The Wayans Brothers have managed to create a very funny film despite the obvious ""drag-queen"" gags and stabs at the differences between blacks and rich whites.This movie is laugh out loud funny and you may even find something in it to make you even laugh at yourself....we are all at risk when the Wayans are involved! Directed by Keenan Ivory Wayans and starring his two hilarious brothers, Marlon and Shawn, there are so many silly moments it will keep you in stitches. Marlon and Shawn are FBI agents who begin by messing up a stake out in a convenience store only to embark on another case in which they must pose as two rich heiresses in order to protect them from a kidnapping. Needless to say it sounds impossible for two handsome black men to suddenly become two likable white chicks but somehow the makeup artists manage to almost pull it off. While the initial gag rests in the fact that men are attempting to act like two cute women the true gags come in the surrounding material, with an excellent cast of comedians pulling it all off with brilliance.Marlon and Shawn Wayans are truly funny in their roles as rich white chickies, they perfect the mannerisms and accents of spoiled ""valley girls"" while retaining just enough of their bumbling machismo to make the act even funnier. The reference to botok and silicon only makes their plastic made up faces all the more believable because we all see enough of those zombie women running around to believe a frozen cosmetic face works in our society. Surrounding the brothers is a great cast of characters all playing up the snobbish idea of life as a rich white Hamptonite complete with shopping tips (wear open toed shoes if you have a size 14 foot and buy a 12!), cosmetic slumber parties, valley girl music and Prada, Prada, Prada. The funniest character in this film however is played by Terry Crews, as basketball player Latrell Spencer, who has an appetite for rich white meat. With every stereotypical slap presented Crews just plays along and does so brilliantly and he shines during a scene where he serenades his date with a very frilly white chick song!This movie is great for a day of laughing, at yourself and others. It is silly and meant to just be entertaining. Although the Wayans brothers could never be mistaken for real women this movie would have failed if they had perfected the art of real drag-queens. The true creativity in this film comes exactly from the imperfections, something we all have but too many of us try to cover up under layers of plastic at least the Wayans can still smile and laugh under theirs.",5,Oh My Gaawwdd.......This is Soooo Funny!,1099008000,"10 29, 2004",2004,2597,"['Wayans', 'Brothers', 'have', 'managed', 'create', 'very', 'funny', 'film', 'obvious', 'drag-queen', 'gags', 'stabs', 'differences', 'blacks', 'rich', 'whites.This', 'movie', 'laugh', 'out', 'loud', 'funny', 'may', 'even', 'find', 'something', 'make', 'even', 'laugh', 'are', 'risk', 'when', 'Wayans', 'are', 'involved', 'Directed', 'Keenan', 'Ivory', 'Wayans', 'starring', 'two', 'hilarious', 'brothers', 'Marlon', 'Shawn', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'silly', 'moments', 'will', 'keep', 'stitches', 'Marlon', 'Shawn', 'are', 'FBI', 'agents', 'who', 'begin', 'messing', 'up', 'stake', 'out', 'convenience', 'store', 'only', 'embark', 'case', 'must', 'pose', 'two', 'rich', 'heiresses', 'order', 'protect', 'kidnapping', 'Needless', 'say', 'impossible', 'two', 'handsome', 'black', 'men', 'suddenly', 'become', 'two', 'likable', 'white', 'chicks', 'somehow', 'makeup', 'manage', 'almost', 'pull', 'off', 'initial', 'gag', 'rests', 'fact', 'men', 'are', 'attempting', 'act', 'two', 'cute', 'women', 'true', 'gags', 'come', 'surrounding', 'material', 'excellent', 'cast', 'comedians', 'pulling', 'off', 'brilliance.Marlon', 'Shawn', 'Wayans', 'are', 'truly', 'funny', 'roles', 'rich', 'white', 'chickies', 'perfect', 'mannerisms', 'accents', 'spoiled', 'valley', 'girls', 'retaining', 'just', 'enough', 'bumbling', 'machismo', 'make', 'act', 'even', 'funnier', 'reference', 'botok', 'silicon', 'only', 'plastic', 'made', 'up', 'more', 'believable', 'see', 'enough', 'zombie', 'women', 'running', 'around', 'believe', 'frozen', 'cosmetic', 'face', 'society', 'Surrounding', 'brothers', 'great', 'cast', 'characters', 'playing', 'up', 'snobbish', 'idea', 'life', 'rich', 'white', 'Hamptonite', 'complete', 'shopping', 'tips', 'wear', 'open', 'toed', 'shoes', 'have', 'size', '14', 'foot', 'buy', '12', 'cosmetic', 'slumber', 'parties', 'valley', 'girl', 'music', 'Prada', 'Prada', 'Prada', 'funniest', 'character', 'film', 'however', 'played', 'Terry', 'Crews', 'basketball', 'player', 'Latrell', 'Spencer', 'who', 'appetite', 'rich', 'white', 'meat', 'stereotypical', 'slap', 'presented', 'Crews', 'just', 'along', 'so', 'brilliantly', 'scene', 'where', 'date', 'very', 'frilly', 'white', 'chick', 'song', 'movie', 'great', 'day', 'laughing', 'others', 'silly', 'meant', 'just', 'be', 'entertaining', 'Wayans', 'brothers', 'could', 'never', 'be', 'mistaken', 'real', 'women', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'failed', 'had', 'perfected', 'art', 'real', 'drag-queens', 'true', 'creativity', 'film', 'exactly', 'imperfections', 'something', 'have', 'too', 'many', 'try', 'cover', 'up', 'layers', 'plastic', 'least', 'Wayans', 'can', 'still', 'smile', 'theirs']",N/A

I was initially a little disappointed in this movie given the Wayans' track record (Scary Movie, I'm Gonna Get You, Sucka!) but it was still funny and fun and it gets funnier each time I watch it!

Speaking of which, I cannot figure out why this version is unrated.  I have watched it a few times and I cannot gather enough evidence to warrant slapping a red cover on it; an R maybe, but unrated?  And there is hardly anything ""cut"" from the PG-13 version.  But, whatever!The Wayans bros are the best when they are doing their direct imitations of the Wilson sisters (The bags are in the car, Jose!  I am soooo freckin' pissed!  I'm gonna have a B.F.!)  It is FUNNY!  But some of the absolutely most hilarious parts in this film take place when ""Tiffany""/Marcus (Marlon Wayans) is being relentlessly pursued by a huge basketball player, Latrell Spencer (played by Terry Crews, who is also hilarious in his role).
