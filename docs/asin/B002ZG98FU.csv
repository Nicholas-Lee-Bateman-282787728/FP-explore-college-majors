They are such great actors and their parts were reduced to sniveling and snapping counterparts (especially Ford). For the talent the two of them have, I was very disappointed, as Harrison Ford was one of the main reasons I watched this film. Also disappointing was the language. Good grief, this is PG-13?

1307351,AQQBRDQ2QJOO8,B002ZG98FU,Andrew C Wheeler,"[10, 16]","Several times while The Wife and I were watching MORNING GLORY, the Blu-Ray quietly skipped ahead a chapter or three, jumping over twenty minutes or so at a clip. Sneakily, it repeatedly tried to do that by jumping between scenes that both featured the young heroine (Rachel McAdams) having a meeting with her boss (Jeff Goldblum). When the movie itself tries to tell you, ""You don't really want to watch this,"" it's not a good sign. Possibly worse, we didn't realize the first jump had happened until the second one hit -- and didn't really miss the twenty minutes in which the movie laboriously explained how McAdams went from a minor producer on a minor early-morning cable show out in the wilds of New Jersey to running the big morning show for what's supposed to be one of the Big Three networks in New York.MORNING GLORY for a long time looks like it's going to become yet another story in which a hard-working young person learns to quit and slack off for the greater glory of her soul, but ends up slightly less cliched than that in the end. McAdams is painfully perky, and has the unrealistic klutziness that modern movies use to telegraph that she is the female lead in a romantic comedy, but she does work hard, and she does mean well. Her job, basically, is to drag that morning TV show away from the bottom of the ratings, and her great hope of doing so was to team gruff, grizzled veteran newsman Harrison Ford (playing it by finding the least likable aspects of Dan Rather, Mike Wallace, and Andy Rooney) with the existing female host of the show, Diane Keaton.And, in a movie made two or more decades ago, the relationship between Keaton and Ford would be the center of the movie -- it *should* be the center of the movie. But it's not, because the big face at the middle of any movie poster has to be young and perky, so McAdams is shoehorned into every scene. Oddly, her own relationship -- with the nearly colorless Patrick Wilson, there primarily to be the hunky guy who she clearly deserves and so doesn't need to have any characterization of his own -- is mostly filled in through implication and allusion, as if the movie couldn't be bothered to actually have a romance in its romantic comedy.So MORNING GLORY is shiny and obvious and constructed entirely according to formula: it's a Hollywood romantic comedy; we all expected that. Keaton and Ford are good in it -- though they could have been much better if the movie were allowed to be about them, and not the random young klutz wandering through their lives. And -- even though I kept a beady eye on the time-code on my disc player throughout the second hour of the movie -- I kept getting the feeling that I was still missing scenes, and this time they were scenes that didn't make it into the movie at all. In any case, MORNING GLORY won't thrill anyone but died-in-the-wool Harrison Ford fans, but it won't offend anyone but the most Milquetoast of Dubuque grandmothers, either.",2,"Bland and obvious, but good-hearted",1302912000,"04 16, 2011",2011,2959,"['Several', 'times', 'Wife', 'were', 'watching', 'MORNING', 'GLORY', 'Blu-Ray', 'quietly', 'skipped', 'ahead', 'chapter', 'three', 'jumping', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'so', 'clip', 'Sneakily', 'repeatedly', 'tried', 'do', 'jumping', 'scenes', 'featured', 'young', 'heroine', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'having', 'meeting', 'boss', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'When', 'movie', 'tell', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'want', 'watch', 'not', 'good', 'sign', 'Possibly', 'worse', 'did', ""n't"", 'realize', 'first', 'jump', 'had', 'happened', 'second', 'one', 'hit', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'miss', 'twenty', 'minutes', 'movie', 'laboriously', 'explained', 'how', 'McAdams', 'went', 'minor', 'producer', 'minor', 'early-morning', 'cable', 'show', 'wilds', 'New', 'Jersey', 'running', 'big', 'morning', 'show', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'one', 'Big', 'Three', 'networks', 'New', 'York.MORNING', 'GLORY', 'long', 'time', 'going', 'become', 'yet', 'story', 'hard-working', 'young', 'person', 'quit', 'slack', 'off', 'greater', 'glory', 'soul', 'up', 'slightly', 'less', 'cliched', 'end', 'McAdams', 'painfully', 'perky', 'unrealistic', 'klutziness', 'modern', 'movies', 'use', 'telegraph', 'female', 'lead', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'work', 'hard', 'mean', 'well', 'job', 'basically', 'drag', 'morning', 'TV', 'show', 'away', 'bottom', 'ratings', 'great', 'hope', 'doing', 'so', 'was', 'team', 'gruff', 'grizzled', 'veteran', 'newsman', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'playing', 'finding', 'least', 'likable', 'aspects', 'Dan', 'Rather', 'Mike', 'Wallace', 'Andy', 'Rooney', 'existing', 'female', 'host', 'show', 'Diane', 'Keaton.And', 'movie', 'made', 'two', 'more', 'decades', 'ago', 'relationship', 'Keaton', 'Ford', 'would', 'be', 'center', 'movie', '*should*', 'be', 'center', 'movie', 'not', 'big', 'face', 'middle', 'movie', 'poster', 'be', 'young', 'perky', 'so', 'McAdams', 'shoehorned', 'scene', 'Oddly', 'own', 'relationship', 'nearly', 'colorless', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'primarily', 'be', 'hunky', 'guy', 'who', 'clearly', 'deserves', 'so', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'characterization', 'own', 'mostly', 'filled', 'implication', 'allusion', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'bothered', 'actually', 'have', 'romance', 'romantic', 'comedy.So', 'MORNING', 'GLORY', 'shiny', 'obvious', 'constructed', 'entirely', 'according', 'formula', 'Hollywood', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'expected', 'Keaton', 'Ford', 'are', 'good', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better', 'movie', 'were', 'allowed', 'be', 'not', 'random', 'young', 'klutz', 'wandering', 'lives', 'even', 'kept', 'beady', 'eye', 'time-code', 'disc', 'player', 'second', 'hour', 'movie', 'kept', 'getting', 'feeling', 'was', 'still', 'missing', 'scenes', 'time', 'were', 'scenes', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'movie', 'case', 'MORNING', 'GLORY', 'wo', ""n't"", 'thrill', 'anyone', 'died-in-the-wool', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'fans', 'wo', ""n't"", 'offend', 'anyone', 'most', 'Milquetoast', 'Dubuque', 'grandmothers', 'either']",N/A
1307352,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B002ZG98FU,Andrew Ellington,"[0, 0]","As far as romantic comedies are concerned, they really are a dime a dozen and for the most part I could do with the eradication of the entire genre.  For every `When Harry Met Sally' there are a billion Sarah Jessica Parker/Jenifer Lopez/Freddie Prince Jr. debacles that it becomes overwhelming just looking at the movie posters clogging the theater with film after film after film promising the same premise with the same actors botching up the same scripts.Gag me.But, with all of that madness circulating the local theater, there was one particular rom/com (as they are affectionately referred to) that looked so incredibly dull and yet wound up kind of blowing me away.  That isn't to say that it is without the curse of the clich&eacute;, but `Morning Glory' kind of owns it every step of the way and delivers a really fun and entertaining ride that didn't make me feel guilty for one second.  I kind of loved it (kind of) and wish that more rom/com's would find the same fresh mixture of witty dialog and capable actors.  That is really what makes `Morning Glory' surpass the competition, for it really understands how to make something so predictable dumb feel smart and infectious.  The cast of characters are well handled by their actors and the screenplay gave enough one-liners with bite to the cast so that they could grab hold of us with wit and charm and really make us WANT to watch them.Can we all just bow in the presence of Diane Keaton for a moment.  Seriously, this woman has had her ups and downs with many (including me) and I often find her breed of manic comedic timing to be overcooked and detrimental to her own talent (which is undeniable).  I prefer her when she's serious because she doesn't try to hard (where was that Oscar for her in 1981, when her `Reds' performance toppled over her fellow nominees?).  Striking such an appropriate balance, Keaton lets her hammy tendencies sell every ounce of character that Colleen Peck possesses.  She attacks this performance like a beast and because of that she winds up the very best thing that could have happened to this movie.Yes, Rachel McAdams and sweet and charming (she does rom/com better than Amy Adams) and Harrison Ford is adorably grouchy and Patrick Wilson has great abs, but at the end of the day it is Diane Keaton that runs away with every scene with her biting delivery.There is no escaping the eventualities of the genre though.  The relationship troubles thanks to the overworked is present, even if the relationship McAdams's character has with Wilson's isn't given the time of day to begin with (so unimportant so why should we care if they breakup to makeup), and the overall dynamic and eventual decisions made between McAdams's character and that of Harrison's can be seen a mile away...and still, this film just works!I can't complain.

With the cast of McAdams, Keaton, Goldblum, Ty Burell (Phil from Modern Family) and, of course, Harrison Ford who would think that anything could go wrong, but it just falls flat.  It starts off great as McAdams is hired  as the executive producer of a last place morning network show that supposedly is supposed to rival the glorious Today Show.  She comes in and shakes things up, juggles things around and tries to save the show's ratings by bringing in Harrison Ford who plays a disgruntled former anchorman who longs to do REAL news and not fluffy crap.  The dynamics between Ford and Keaton start strong as the two do battle and insult each other and McAdams tries to contain her disappointment in her idol by finding out that he is an ass.  There are a few tender moments and then it seems like they needed to race to the finish.  Suddenly, the characters all see the light at the same time and the grand finale of the movie just leaves you dry.  There are a few funny moments where McAdams forces the weatherman into Jackass style wacky stunts to boost the ratings, but other than that, you don't really feel much for these characters.

He's the HARD BOILED EGG of an anchorman with a soft golden yolk heart that he has kept under wraps for years; and it takes the frisky energy and boundless belief of McAdams to finally crack his hard shell and set this Lovable Curmudgeon free. Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton are the reasons that I purchased this DVD. I could watch this movie once a week, and still laugh out loud at their pairing and their exchange of barbed insults. Yes, McAdams is puppy-dog cute & frisky, her love interest is hunky; but it's the repartee, those mild insults both on and off camera that Ford and Keaton sweetly hurl at each other [""It's hard to get between you and a sausage...], that spice up this script. Accolades,as well, to superb Jeff Goldblum as the Big Man Upstairs, who carries himself with aplomb; in fact accolades to the Casting Director for each and every character placed in his or her role. The cast is empathetic, believable and lovable. It's Ford and Keaton who make this script fly! Note Ford's catharsis at the end of the film; his sudden realization that, ""Yes,""  he can be a hard-core Anchor Man AND an approachable human at the same time.

Becky(Rachel McAdams) is a super go getter that gets the shaft from her current news gig and after much job searching lands another news job . She has her work cut out for her when she's set w/ the task of reworking the morning line up after she gives the male anchor the boot. Colleen Peck(Diane Keaton) is the co-anchor of the morning show + is psyched to jump into the wacky fluff pieces that Becky is using to turn the show around. Becky uses a loop hole in Mike Pomeroy(Harrison Ford)'s contract to force him into the empty co-anchor seat opposite Colleen. Mike being a seasoned + serious reporter fights Becky's fluff pieces at every turn. Things become more complicated when Jerry Barnes(Jeff Goldblum) tells Becky that the show will be cancelled unless it miraculously jumps in the ratings. Becky's personal life is also complicated by Adam Bennett(Patrick Wilson)who also works at the station. Becky + Adam's relationship is put to the test when her drop everything attitiude for work rears its head repeatedly. Put to the breaking point by Mike Pomeroy's continued refusal to do things her way, Becky leaves the station when offered the job she's always wanted. But Mike finally seeing the error of his ways does a fluff piece for Becky which woes her back to the station. In the end everything works out perfectly.

Good news:  It's not, but it's also a great date movie.  I think you may actually be able to get your boyfriend to watch this one instead of ""Blood 'n' Guts, Sequel 29.""Becky Fuller is looking forward to reshaping a tanking morning show, but has serious trouble when former news hotshot Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) declares mutiny on doing anything lightweight, thus beginning an all-out war on the air with his co-host (Diane Keaton).The story is good, making you wonder if this is what really goes on behind the scenes at the Today Show, and is very good at mocking the insipid jokes they fake laugh at on the camera.  Diane Keaton and Ford play off each other so well as enraged egomaniacs, but McAdams and Ford have a solid chemistry that makes you feel they've known each other forever.  The romantic sparks between her character and Patrick Wilson are virtually nonexistent, but the nice thing is that it's mostly on the backburner throughout the film, only accentuating Becky's frenzied workaholism.  Smart move on the director's part.Let's face it, though:  Harrison Ford plays Mike Pomeroy so well and so comfortably, that he is truly the indisputable star of the flick.  His sarcastic one-liners and curmudgeonly conduct are so laugh-out-loud funny that you end up liking Pomeroy instead of wanting to choke him!  Ford steals every single scene he's in from our beautiful top-billed star, but that's not a bad thing.  It is a great vehicle for them both, and each actor's generations can be brought together through this project, but I have already liked both for some time now.  Also of note:  Jeff Goldblum's scenes are not plentiful, but he's got some very funny lines as well.Good story, great cast, and not the typical comedy that's out there.  Not so romantic, but it still works on levels that won't make you feel like a schmuck for getting into it.  That's why it is a great movie wether you are dating or not.

1307369,A18G7GG53G2X8A,B002ZG98FU,Chris Pandolfi,"[5, 10]","It isn't often you see a film in which every actor is painfully misdirected. Rachel McAdams performs most of ""Morning Glory"" as if she were a little girl on a bad sugar high, always with the anxious babbling and the perky expressions and the neurotic enthusiasm she brings to her situation, which is itself so horribly contrived that it doesn't belong in a movie so much as it does on a sitcom. Harrison Ford, an accomplished actor if ever there was one, delivers every line like a growling dog ready to attack an intruder, his voice low and gravelly and unendurably monotone. Diane Keaton, also quite accomplished, plays her character as a clich&eacute; - laughing on the outside but screaming on the inside, crunching on pills as if they were candy. And then there's Jeff Goldblum, although in his case, it doesn't have much to do with direction; he can't seem to be anyone other than himself, no matter what role he plays.""Morning Glory"" is an utterly ridiculous film. The plot is goofy and scatterbrained, relying almost entirely on throwaway gags and set-ups that wouldn't even pass muster in a romantic comedy. The performances are desperately broad and show not the slightest traces of truth. It was written by Aline Brosh McKenna, the same woman who brought the far funnier and far more intelligent ""The Devil Wears Prada"" to the big screen. Having followed that with the awful ""27 Dresses"" and now this, I'd hate to think that her success with ""Prada"" was nothing more than a fluke.The plot: McAdams plays Becky Fuller, a workaholic New Jersey TV news producer who dreams of landing a job over at ""The Today Show."" After getting fired from a local news studio, she's immediately hired as the executive producer for a failing New York morning news show called ""Daybreak."" The boss, Jerry Barnes (Goldblum), interviews her with the kind of depressing certainty that one must apply to choosing a casket. Everything behind the scenes is chaos, the studio populated by annoying, insufferable caricatures that sling all sorts of meaningless ideas at her. On air, the show is a dispensable mishmash of cooking segments, animal acts, and celebrity gossip. Oh, and the occasional weather report, provided Ernie Appleby (Matt Malloy), a silly man who thinks rooster-shaped weather vanes are fascinating for some reason. Becky's mission is to prevent the show from being cancelled.The lead anchor, Colleen Peck (Keaton), seems to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown, a woman who has seen so many co-anchors and executive producers come and go, she has given up all hope. The latest co-anchor, a sleazy egomaniac with a foot fetish, is immediately fired; this leaves Becky able to pursue Mike Pomeroy (Ford), a man whose years of esteemed reporting is second only the dubious distinction of being the third worst person in the world. Indeed, he's a broken, spiteful, difficult, miserable soul - angry at what passes for news nowadays, frustrated that he's not wanted for in-depth investigative journalism but merely for morning banter. Unfortunately for him, he has time left on his contract. Becky not only knows this, but also uses it against him. And so, with extreme misgivings, he becomes the new co-anchor of ""Daybreak.""As Becky tries desperately to raise the show's ratings, she begins a relationship with a fellow producer named Adam (Patrick Wilson), who finds Becky interesting but struggles to tear her away from her ever-ringing Blackberry. He's the film's only tolerable character, probably because he's developed at a level beyond a series of bizarre quirks. Alas, it's precisely because of this that he disappears into the background; all the weird characters take center stage, and while that might sound like a lot of fun, here it's just plain exhausting. The relationship itself is nothing more or less than typical romcom material, something I can and do get my fill of year after year after year.There was, in short, nothing much I liked about ""Morning Glory."" Its biggest miscalculation is its cast - or, more accurately, how the cast is directed. Harrison Ford in particular is an embarrassingly odd fit, his voice rarely if ever rising above a grating one-note lull. When he finally is given the opportunity to show genuine emotion, it soon becomes clear that it's in service of a scene of amazingly clunky sentimentalism.

Not only is she irresistibly attractive and adorable, she's funny, smart, dedicated, and truly talented at her job, which not too many people on the planet could pull off. So why on Earth a television network would let her go is beyond her comprehension and ours. Nevertheless, she's fired from her job as executive producer, due to budget cuts. Rachel McAdams gives one of, if not thee best performance of her career as Becky, in Morning Glory.Now that she's been let go she is desperately seeking employment elsewhere only to find dead end after dead end. Finally, she catches a break when she's hired on as executive producer for a morning show in the slumps.She has her work cut out for her to say the least. The show is a disaster. The lead anchor is a chauvinistic creep, the network can offer only pathetic jokes for stories, and virtually no one really has a desire to be there, nor do they take their job seriously.The person that displays this best is Colleen Peck, played by the lovely Diane Keaton. A veteran of the morning show, she wakes up every day no doubt asking herself why she is still there. Along with everyone else, Colleen cannot really see any potential in Becky, offhand.It's evident the news cast needs immediate revamping to get their ratings up, if they are to stay on the air. Enter: Harrison Ford. Ford plays Mike Pomeroy, a television legend who has long since hung up his hat as a news reporter. His solid plans of lackadaisically waiting out the time left on his contract are interrupted when Becky is struck with the notion that Pomeroy could be precisely what the show needs.Becky forces him out of his fantasy world and back into reality, where he must lower himself to the likes of a morning news caster. As he showed in his previous film Extraordinary Measures, when it comes to playing a bitter recluse, Ford has the act down. Together they will try to do all they can do to save this sinking show and that's where the laughs come in.Morning Glory scored big laughs with the packed audience I shared the experience with; especially when Becky has to `up the ante' so to speak, by orchestrating some hilariously drastic interviews and broadcasts that include a feeble man screaming his brains out on a roller coaster, with a camera mounted two inches from his head. Cut to Harrison Ford's face as he watches open mouthed, out of sheer morbid curiosity - and  we are laughing our heads off.Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna knows comedy and she knows romance and she knows how to balance the two perfectly in an artistic melody. She's shown this before in 27 Dresses, The Laws of Attraction and Three to Tango. Morning Glory isn't a rom-com by any means, but it has a little romance nestled in there for good measure. Patrick Wilson has a small part as the office hunk and he is charming and likeable without bogging the story or the comedy down with heavy romance.Director Roger Michell who's brought us such gems as Changing Lanes and Notting Hill, has delivered another one. He lets great actors do great acting and he brings us to a world that I found fascinating and that I haven't seen too much of in movies, which is: what it takes to produce a live television broadcast. Not sure it's a venture I'd sprint to the head of the line to work in personally; but I certainly enjoyed watching humorous and believable movie-people at each other's throats in it for nearly two hours.

Ford & Keaton play the lead on-air personalities... but the movie is mostly about McAdams' character.

I have a degree in broadcasting, and love stories of those in the field.  Morning Glory, the latest ""news-movie"" to be released, debates the question of how much ""bran"" (hard news stories) vs. ""donuts"" (fluff pieces) should be shown during a national morning news show.The film has an all-star cast led by Rachel McAdams (The Time Traveler's Wife, Red Eye) who plays 28 year-old Becky. Down on her luck and recently fired, she takes the only job she can get working for the low-rated Day Break news show. It's a program that wants to be like The Today Show, but cannot keep up to that pace of professionalism. Through a couple clever (or stupid) turns, she convinces a legendary reporter, Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), to join the other resident host Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) after the firing of another host (Modern Family's Ty Burrell).

She is quickly hired by a much less respected network and sets out to pull this faltering news show out of the dumps.  Now that I have given a general synopsis I will continue to do what I had originaly intended to do here, completely trash this abysmal train wreck of a movie that stole nearly 2 hours of my life.  Mcadams is about as appealing as a chiuaua on speed in this movie,  she jumps around, chatters endlessly and knocks things over.  It was cute for about 10 minutes but got exhausting fast.  Enter the great Dianne Keaton, a foul mouthed news anchor who's less than satisfied with her role at the network,  she is given little to do here and gives the ""hey as long as the check clears"" impression.  We are then introduced to a character played by the usually dependable Harrison Ford, a gruff sarcastic highly esteemed news anchor who feels this network is beneath him, hey maybe thats a parable about this whole movie being beneath him.  The absolute worse thing about Morning Glory are the endless movie cliche's.  This was as predictical as movies get, not helped by annoying songs interspresed with scenes that were more jarring than feel good.  I wont even go into the forced love story subplot involving another coworker (Patrick Wilson in a completely thankless role).

This morning show is in a shambles with one producer being fired after another but Becky is determined to make things work, and she even brings in a stubborn old news anchor played by Harrison Ford, whom she has always admired, to try and raise the ratings for the show. But initially this results in what seems like a downward spiral for this 40 year old show as there is immediate conflict with the current morning anchor (Diane Keaton).

1307400,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,B002ZG98FU,Ed Uyeshima,"[0, 0]","Rachel McAdams (The Notebook) gives a performance I can only describe as strenuously perky in this hectically edited 2010 comedy that seems to be equal partsBroadcast NewsandThe Mary Tyler Moore Showbut with little of James L. Brooks' sharp sense of humor or ironic ambivalence shared by both. This film does not offer a terribly shrewd perspective about media manipulation or accountability. Rather, director Roger Michell (Venus) and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada) go for much softer targets like career versus love and youth versus experience. The approach strikes me as somewhat of a shame since a more than capable cast has been assembled for what amounts to bland, fitfully funny studio product. McKenna's script will remind viewers of ""Prada"" in that both stories focus on a young career-minded woman trying to buck the odds in order to take her place in a profession filled with sharks and naysayers.This time, her name is Becky Fuller, an upbeat, Type-A producer of a New Jersey morning TV show. She gets fired due to staff cuts, so she immediately applies for a job in Manhattan at the fourth-place network for their Today Show wannabe, ""Daybreak"", stuck in the ratings cellar for years. Out of desperation and a hunch, network executive Jerry Barnes decides to give Becky a chance to produce ""Daybreak"". Things start out badly when she gets browbeaten by longtime anchor Colleen Peck, whose cheery on-air disposition masks a simmering frustration with having a revolving door of co-hosts. Becky decides to hire veteran newsman Mike Pomeroy who is sitting out the rest of his multi-million dollar contract after being let go of his coveted evening news anchor spot. Most of the movie is about how Becky tries to coax the human side out of Pomeroy's curmudgeonly personality to find his inner Matt Lauer. Of course, getting the ratings up for her show makes her less available to romance ""young buck"" evening news producer Adam Bennett.Harrison Ford plays Pomeroy strictly on a constant note of indifferent constipation, which is fitting for his character but not all that interesting to watch over the course of the film. Diane Keaton fares somewhat better as Colleen because the character plays well to the dichotomy of her most persistent film persona, the polished professional and the dithering doormat. The best thing about the film is how the two veterans display a sharp, nasty-edged on-air rapport which I wish Michell explored more. As Adam, Patrick Wilson (Little Children) is simply wasted in a himbo role constantly flustered by Becky but strangely drawn to her at the same time. Jeff Goldblum makes his few scenes count as Barnes because unlike the other actors, he's not afraid to show the cold, ruthless arrogance that probably made his character successful.

Iffy comments like that being bandied about by a morning talk show anchor, well, the guy's just begging to be fired. Rachel McAdams plays Becky Fuller, the young new executive producer of a perpetual cellar-dwelling morning talk show who must quickly whip her staff into shape and drive up the ratings, lest ""new producer"" promptly becomes ""ex-producer."" This morning program she finds herself employed in is so down in the dumps that even the doorknobs don't function. One of Becky's first and immediate hurdles is how she responds to this crude talk show host. She very publicly gives him his walking papers, and the staff is mildly impressed.What's the story, morning glory? What's the word, hummingbird? Things turn around, thanks to Becky's boundless energy and inventiveness, but mostly to her big get in the shape of Daybreak's new co-host, the legendary Pulitzer Prize winner (and unbelievably superior and condescending) Mike Pomeroy (a wonderfully acerbic Harrison Ford). Except that Pomeroy, an old school, serious news anchor, maintains that ""news is a sacred temple"" and he won't stoop to doing fluff pieces, which happen to be the lifeblood of morning talk shows. His diva ploy doesn't sit real well with his television partner, Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) who herself massages a gynormous ego. Anyway, here come the mutual upstaging and combativeness and the frightful bicker, waged in excruciatingly polite tones. The pity of the thing is that Ford and Keaton aren't given enough scenes in which they exchange wicked banter.MORNING GLORY does feature a romantic comedy angle, but it's a weak, half-hearted effort, at best. While not as meaty, MORNING GLORY bears closer kinship with BROADCAST NEWS, a film which does have romantic elements but focuses more on the behind-the-scenes minutiae of putting together a television show. Wisely, the plot in MORNING GLORY hones in more closely on the trying working relationship between Becky Fuller and her demanding star Mike Pomeroy. That's not to say that Patrick Wilson, who plays the love interest, isn't funny and sensitive and quite the catch. But he's simply not as compelling as Harrison Ford, even if (or maybe because) Ford's character is widely regarded as ""the third worst person in the world."" Star power crushes the charming up-and-comer, and, really, the true emotional pull comes from McAdams' interactions with Ford. They've got this neat contentious mentor-student, almost father-daughter thing going on.I've seen Rachel McAdams in MEAN GIRLS and SLINGS & ARROWS and in RED EYE, and she's uniformly excelled in these different genres. One more time, in MORNING GLORY, she proves to be a first rate comedienne. She's such a pleasure to watch (and I don't mean that she's just pretty to ogle at). Her character here, relentlessly talky and unendingly klutzy, is a fairly cliched one. But, to me, it speaks of how talented she is that she's still able to turn something contrived into something endearing. And, yeah, I think it's endearing that her character's aggressive rambling and work obsessiveness are defensive coping mechanisms. She's just so watchable.MORNING GLORY doles out plenty of laughs, some stemming from the cast's sparkling (sometimes very caustic) dialogue, some from the crazy antics McAdams comes up with in her all out efforts to save her show from cancellation. And, oh, that weatherman, the mad s#!t he had to go thru, for ratings' sake. His ordeals made me laugh a lot, the poor bastard. In the end, it all works out. Daybreak achieves a ratings boost, stays on the air. Ford gets to break a hard-hitting story. Even the doorknobs get fixed.",4,"""Okay, the Jewish guy is crossing himself.

1307413,A3N0AXNEZVE686,B002ZG98FU,Hound Dog,"[0, 1]","""Morning Glory"" aspires to be the movie equivalent of a morning latte (a perky, frothy concoction), but it more closely resembles a shaken-up can of diet soda, as once all the fizz has dissolved, there is not much left to enjoy other than a few empty calories.  The heroine, Becky Fuller (a dynamic Rachel McAdams) is an ambitious young producer surprisingly given the opportunity to resurrect the long-ailing, 40-year old network morning news program, ""Daybreak.""  With cantankerous new co-anchor Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to constantly babysit, relentlessly upbeat Becky (she's practically a human espresso machine) has her hands full reviving ""Daybreak"" while still trying to make time to fulfill other basic needs in her high-pressure, workaholic lifestyle.All in all, ""Morning Glory"" initially made me wonder if it could be a stellar 21st Century equivalent of ""I'll take on New York and win big"" movies like 1987's ""Secret of My Success and 1988's ""Working Girl.""  The only problem is that this movie's minimal storyline probably would have worked better as an above-average TV movie rather than an inflated big-screen spotlight vehicle for Ms. McAdams.  Admirably, she performs just as well as other talented actresses, like Anne Hathaway, Kate Hudson, and Reese Witherspoon would have done with the same role.  Beyond McAdams, her best able support comes from Diane Keaton, as peppy (at least, on-air) co-anchor Colleen Peck.  Keaton has done better work elsewhere, but here she is spot on as an aging yet spry morning news personality willing to try almost anything to keep her jeopardized program afloat.  Further, John Pankow (as Becky's assistant), Jeff Goldblum (as her world-weary division chief), and Patti D'Arbanville (as Becky's mom) add some nice supporting performances.  Patrick Wilson, as Adam (Becky's love interest), does the best he can with a pretty clich&eacute;d role, but he is unable to add much glimmer to the tired plot.Unfortunately, even less could be said for co-lead Harrison Ford, who, in an all-too-ironic parallel to his grouchy on-screen alter ego, appears to know he is slumming here and his coasting performance clearly pays for it.  It is not all Ford's fault, as he was simply miscast probably for star power purposes.  Even cameos by real television anchors and an ""interview"" with Condoleeza Rice can't provide Ford with the necessary credibility to make viewers visualize his character as being up there with Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw.  The film instead really needed someone like Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson, or William Shatner, who could have gleefully contributed the funny zip, zeal, or quirkiness to bring a pompous jerk like Pomeroy truly to life (after all, this movie is supposed to be a sparkly romantic comedy). Even another retread of the late Ted Knight's bombastic, self-important Ted Baxter persona would have likely worked here.The problems with ""Morning Glory"" can readily be captured by its underwhelming climax (during which Becky must choose between a revitalized ""Daybreak"" and another network's dream job) by demonstrating that some terrific little moments end up lost in a clich&eacute;d-driven finale.  If this flimsy script had been sent in for needed repairs early on, ""Morning Glory"" may well have been easily salvageable.  Otherwise, for Rachel McAdams fans, one should enjoy it as a preview of better works from her down the road.Rating: 6.5/10 (Watchable and undemanding, probably a nice date night choice).P.S.  Very little is provided on the special features, including only one deleted scene.

My fianc&eacute; has been told up front if I ever meet her, hmmmmm, then all bets are off.  Well, after she smacked me I came back to my senses, but still, I have thought very highly of Rachel McAdams since first seeing ""The Notebook"".  That is why it is so hard for me to write this review.  ""Morning Glory"" was mediocre at its best.  None of the actors seemed to click with each other and the chemistry was about as good as oil and vinegar.  Didn't I hear someplace the two don't mix?  Damn, maybe that was vinegar and oil.After seeing this movie I do wonder how you could pull together a cast with this much talent and come away with such a mundane showing.  Somehow that is exactly what Roger Michell seemed to do and we were left watching his rarely chuckling mediocrity.Rachel's character is Becky.  She is perky, quirky and talks I swear to God nonstop.  I don't think she every closes her mouth, even when she is eating.  She is a producer for a TV show that is about to get revamped and unfortunately the plans do not include her, so she is fired.  Can we all say, been there, done that?  Becky goes into hyper drive looking for a new show to call home and with little family support, her mother should be spanked if that is allowed, finds a home on a flailing morning talk show.Enter Diane Keaton, who I also love in almost every role she plays.  Diane is the aging senior anchor for the show and will do just about anything asked of her on air, including filming her pap smear.  Damn, now there are some things nobody should show on TV, even if people will watch it.  Her sidekick is a sexual pervert and Rachel (Becky) fires him on day one.  I know, it is getting a little boring in the description huh......  Well, that is about how the show played out as it plodded along.  I was hoping when Harrison Ford popped in he would liven things up a little bit, but his character was so dry and dull that he actually took it down to a slower paced, more depressing speed.Mr. Michell (the director) did attempt a half hearted effort at showing a love interest for Rachel McAdams, but like the rest of the cast, there was no chemistry and the scenes played out more like a bad date.I did laugh a couple of times, and I did get to see Rachel on screen which holds a lot of water in my book, but I sure do wish I would have seen something else.  Maybe this will play out a little better once it hits the DVD/On Demand market but I would choose watching ""The Notebook"" for the 35th time over seeing this movie again.So I would give it three stars for the attempt, and for giving me a chance to see my favorite Canadian again for a couple of hours, but other than that it wasn't one of my favorites to say the least.",3,Few laughs and very slow paced.,1291852800,"12 9, 2010",2010,2752,"['absolutely', 'love', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'My', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'been', 'told', 'up', 'front', 'ever', 'meet', 'hmmmmm', 'then', 'bets', 'are', 'Well', 'smacked', 'came', 'back', 'senses', 'still', 'have', 'thought', 'very', 'highly', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'first', 'seeing', 'Notebook', 'why', 'so', 'hard', 'write', 'review', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'was', 'mediocre', 'best', 'None', 'actors', 'seemed', 'click', 'other', 'chemistry', 'was', 'as', 'good', 'oil', 'vinegar', 'Did', ""n't"", 'hear', 'someplace', 'two', 'do', ""n't"", 'mix', 'Damn', 'maybe', 'was', 'vinegar', 'oil.After', 'seeing', 'movie', 'do', 'wonder', 'how', 'could', 'pull', 'together', 'cast', 'much', 'talent', 'come', 'away', 'such', 'mundane', 'showing', 'Somehow', 'exactly', 'what', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'seemed', 'do', 'were', 'left', 'watching', 'rarely', 'chuckling', 'mediocrity.Rachel', 'character', 'Becky', 'perky', 'quirky', 'talks', 'swear', 'God', 'nonstop', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'mouth', 'even', 'when', 'eating', 'producer', 'TV', 'show', 'get', 'revamped', 'unfortunately', 'plans', 'do', 'not', 'include', 'fired', 'Can', 'say', 'been', 'there', 'done', 'Becky', 'hyper', 'drive', 'looking', 'new', 'show', 'call', 'home', 'little', 'family', 'support', 'mother', 'should', 'be', 'spanked', 'allowed', 'home', 'flailing', 'morning', 'talk', 'show.Enter', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'who', 'also', 'love', 'almost', 'role', 'Diane', 'aging', 'senior', 'anchor', 'show', 'will', 'do', 'just', 'anything', 'asked', 'air', 'including', 'filming', 'pap', 'smear', 'Damn', 'now', 'are', 'things', 'nobody', 'should', 'show', 'TV', 'even', 'people', 'will', 'watch', 'sidekick', 'sexual', 'pervert', 'Rachel', 'Becky', 'day', 'one', 'know', 'getting', 'little', 'boring', 'description', 'huh', 'Well', 'how', 'show', 'played', 'out', 'plodded', 'along', 'was', 'hoping', 'when', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'popped', 'would', 'liven', 'things', 'up', 'little', 'bit', 'character', 'was', 'so', 'dry', 'dull', 'actually', 'took', 'down', 'slower', 'paced', 'more', 'depressing', 'speed.Mr', 'Michell', 'director', 'did', 'attempt', 'half', 'hearted', 'effort', 'showing', 'love', 'interest', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'rest', 'cast', 'was', 'chemistry', 'scenes', 'played', 'out', 'more', 'bad', 'date.I', 'did', 'couple', 'times', 'did', 'get', 'see', 'Rachel', 'screen', 'lot', 'water', 'book', 'sure', 'do', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'seen', 'something', 'else', 'Maybe', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'little', 'better', 'DVD/On', 'Demand', 'market', 'would', 'choose', 'watching', 'Notebook', '35th', 'time', 'seeing', 'movie', 'again.So', 'would', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'attempt', 'giving', 'chance', 'see', 'favorite', 'Canadian', 'again', 'couple', 'hours', 'other', 'was', ""n't"", 'one', 'favorites', 'say', 'least']",N/A
1307429,A3OP9CU8GUWI03,B002ZG98FU,"J. Ridgway ""Ridge""","[2, 2]","The Good:  the plot about an up-and-coming young professional woman with ""moxie"", working with the old stick-in-the-muds isn't bad, and it's very upbeat in the end.  Other young professionals struggling to find a career in the working world, amongst the old-guard who have a guaranteed job, may find this compelling.  The part where Rachel McAdams starts putting the morning show cast in adventurous and dangerous situations, for ratings, is actually pretty funny.The Bad: (1) A very adultish PG-13 with lots of vulgar language; which makes it more a ""soft R"" for adults than a movie for teens. The F word used several times and several near-times (were they going for an R or just wanting to push the edge of the PG-13 category?), some nasty vulgar sexual and scatalogical references by Harrison Ford's crusty old pompous character, calling people a**hole, saying ""suck ##""  etc.  So if you're an adult and want to watch it with other adults, that's fine, but I'd advise not to watch it with your 13 year old.  (2) The title.  ""Morning Glory"" seems like a Sunday or Christian or at least an innocent kind of phrase.  In reality there's a lot of worldly vulgarity and jerkiness in this movie that's not at all what the title might suggest(see #1). (3) Annoyance factor: some people might get annoyed by McAdams' frenetic energy throughout.  Though it's a personal preference, many might think she's a little too hyped up in this movie. (4) Her ""romantic"" relationship with Patrick Wilson is not developed at all, to the point that one thinks, why is it even in there?  They just have dinner (they say, but you have to take their word for it because it's not even shown) and jump into the sack.  Is that par for the course these days for twenty-somethings? Her friendship/work relationship with Harrison's character is really the focus of the story, but that's not romantic, and so this couldn't really be called a romantic comedy!The pretty ...... Rachel McAdams of course.  Radiant actually, if you like to stare at pretty, high-energy women in their prime beauty who smile a lot.  (Great dimples!) Actually, Dianne Keaton also has a great, radiant smile for someone twice McAdam's age.

1307444,A5GIYITYJPWN1,B002ZG98FU,"L P ""lilip""","[7, 13]","I can safely say that this is one of the worst movies I have seen for a long time. It was boring, unintelligent, drawn out, predictable and the actors had next to zero chemistry between them. Rachel McAdams is super cute of course but painfully perky and other than being super cute and perky, she doesnt seem to have much else to offer. The movie itself just doesnt get going either and remains flat throughout. I actually had to finish this in two sittings because it was soooo boring.There are many lows in this movie but the worst part is the total embarrassment Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton have become. I mean these are two of Hollywood's finest in terms of acting skill and knowing their craft; yet their roles have been reduced to that of bickering, nagging harpies. Especially Harrison Ford, who's always been this sharp, classy and together man, appeared frail, tired, and his hands were trembling. He looked like he really didn't want to do this and as a result delivered an unbelievable performance. To see this legendary actor be reduced to playing a one dimensional, tired and full of stereotypes sidekick to Rachel McAdams and Patrick Wilson, because they are younger and he is older, was very sad. It was a role unworthy of Harrison Ford.Anyway, said Ford's character is a walking clichee. He plays the typical untouchable, revered star (veteran news anchor) whose track record of issues with historic significance covered puts every newscaster and journalist in CNN to shame. He is a man with a stern look and principles. Principles he likes ot shove into everyone's face. He has a disdain for the materialism and consumerism of our times and wants no part in it. In fact, he looks down on everyone, including the network that hired him and stuffed his pocket with lots of money, as having sold out the art of journalism for sponsorship and ratings. Of course he doesnt have a problem lowering those sacred standards and work for daytime tv himself. A fact conveniently glossed over by the writers. Oh well. At some point he felt like one of those guys who want to uphold principles for the sake of upholding them.I dont know what's happened to Harrison Ford, if it is the script or him or what, but he did a lousy job if you ask me. He had already done a pretty bad job doing the last installment of Indiana Jones too. Anyway, here he plays a man who's covered significant historic events and who is supposed to be a legend in his field and passionate about his work. This passion is supposed to create tension and be a real challenge for Rachel McAdams' character who not only has a lot to learn from this man she so admires but who, as a producer, also has to worry about ratings and money - the two things Ford hates; yet, instead of working from that angle and thoughtfully laying out how Ford and Adams work that out, all we get is a fizzled out, flat performance portraying a silly, old man reminiscing about the past and holding on to that ""sixteen-millimeter shrine"" of his glory days. Ford was not believable as a deep intellectual who lost his bearings (which is what they like us to think). He was dispassionate and boring and just seemed grumpy and tired. His heart wasnt in this performance and that shone through. At some point he was so excited playing this role I thought he would break down and yawn. And let's not even talk about the truly monotonous manner with which he delivers the news. There is no way he can pull off a news anchor with that slow stumble. It just sounded too rehearsed and fake and somehow the producers thought we wouldnt catch it since it is Harrison Ford and who'd criticize Ford.The movie went downhill from the moment Ford entered and he and Diane Keaton barked at each other like grumpy old people that have fallen victim to juvenile behavior do and extended into comatose lengths.The love story between McAdams and Patrick Wilson was laughable and totally unbelievable. Patrick Wilson appears to just have been a stand-in, a nameless, faceless hunk to fit the plot element as the handsome dream-man she clearly deserves and who, as a result, doesnt need to be given much of a character other than looking good and being there to move the story along. The specifics of how and why they fall in love are not explored; they have a couple of exchanges and then he becomes the love of her life. Consequently when she says ""you are the first person I thought about wanting to share this with"" or something, it looks ridiculous and insincere, because how could she love him, she hasnt exchanged more than 3 sentences with him. After she says that, there is a cut (i.e. we dont get ot see his reaction and what he says) and the next frame opens right in the middle of a conversation between them after she ""told him"", where he asks her about her JOB. So to recap, this is how the scene went down (not in so many words):She: ""I love you, you are my soul mate. You are the first person I had to tell about this""He: ""Uh-huh. That's great. So, tell me about your JOB and promotion"".Suffice it so say, the love story was totally superfluous in addition to really not adding anything to the movie other than being an all too familiar plot device. In order for the main character to be successful in her career, it is imperative that the obligatory love interest be there too else the formula is incomplete.One of the issues with this movie was that it wasnt clear what this was trying to be. A love story? No, because that wasnt worked out. Was it supposed to be about TV Shows and the hard world of TV production? No, because that wasnt worked out either and the TV setting just seemed to be the incidental backdrop. Was it supposed to be about disillusionment in journalism? No, because - as mentioned above - Ford just did not deliver anything worthwhile and thought provoking in that regard but clichees and banalities. So it is really unclear what they wanted this to be. Drama, rom-com, comedy, comedy-drama, romance, journalism, hard work, working with legends whose glory days are behind them? To me, it seemed a bit like a neurotic mess.So all in all this was a boring, plain movie with flat characters and unintelligent dialogues. It was also very unworthy of the actors. Of course after writing this review I found that JJ Abrams produced it so it doesnt surprise me at all that this has turned out to be such a vacuous, empty and boring star-studded piece of

I won't recount the failures, misfires and plain suckfests that came before, because that only detracts from this great film.It's been, what, 18 years since 'The Paper'? That's how long it's been since I've really enjoyed a movie from this collaborative genre.'Glory' opens with a spunky young producer from a small local affiliate, tapped to become the youngest person to lead a national morning show. Her task: Fix the ratings of the floundering program, starting with bringing to heel old school and former anchor Harrison Ford from the world of serious journalism to the puffy vacuous existence of chunky weathermen, cooking healthy omelettes and fake smiles. All while trying to balance a cast of equally crazy, childish and demanding egocentric personalities - and lest we forget - find love.Excellent filmmaking, hitting the right notes at the right moments. Everyone, and I mean every single cast member, couldn't be more right on the money with their performances.Ford's evolution from a hardwired old-school newsman into a guy that maybe sees his future through a different lens - is smooth, funny, and confidently sublime.And one of the very few films I can say that I enjoyed Diane Keaton. Her continual antagonistic feminism always butchers the films roles she's offered. I realize that she has worked hard to overcome the welcome mat image of her early career, but her decades long battle to swing the pendulum the other way has meant her performances are typically nothing more than angry self-absorbed ideology masking itself as acting. This toned-down version of herself was a considerable relief to say the least. Please Ms. Keaton - more of this and less of the gesticulating skreeching bitch.Absolutely loved Rachel McAdams - she is this generation's Julia Roberts - and we're all the more fortunate for it.

1307448,A36EW68H08UOCS,B002ZG98FU,"Mark J. Fowler ""Let's Play Two!""","[3, 5]","Make no mistake - despite being surrounded by a large cast featuring film icons with decades of experience - this is Rachel McAdams' movie.  The film is similar in tone to countless romantic comedies of the last two decades, but other than a few superficial dates, romance takes a backseat to the story of McAdams' Becky Fuller.  Becky is in her late twenties and, apparently, has WANTED to be the producer of a big morning news show ever since she was a little girl.  My house has been filled with four daughters and I knew of no girls with similar aspirations, but McAdams makes you believe that Becky is pursuing her dream and sacrifice sleep and boyfriends to reach her goal.  One of the great charms of the film is that it makes such a single-mindedly devoted to career person likable.  In a different movie the sacrifice-everything-for-career character would be a villain. McAdams' performance makes you want her to succeed.The start is not promising.  Becky is working for a 4 a.m. local New Jersey show, and expecting a promotion when she is, instead, fired by a producer who writes in her references that she is the ""most talented producer I ever had to fire.""  Becky floods New York with applications and is finally invited to interview for the morning show on the fictional IBS.  Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the IBS executive who interviews the heroine and ""encourages"" her by pointing out that although their show is the worst, by far, of all the network morning shows, her qualifications are among the least-impressive of the various candidates.  McAdams gives a passionate plea and Goldblum makes the decision of a smart Human Resources people everywhere: he hires the candidate with the passion rather than the best credentials.Becky is thrown into the hot water and in the first staff meeting you think she is in over her head, but she surprises the staff - and the film's viewers - by being on top of her game immediately.Diane Keaton is terrific in a pretty thankless role, as the ""face"" of ""Daybreak"" for years, who has seen the show a constantly revolving door for co-anchors and new executive producers, the whole time with ""Daybreak"" at the bottom of the ratings.Harrison Ford is the biggest name in the cast, as Mike Pomeroy, the IBS anchor who for years was a peer with Rather and Brokow, but was fired as anchor of their evening news and is now playing out the end of a six million dollar, two year contract.  Patrick Wilson, as another IBS producer and ersatz love interest, warns Becky that Pomeroy is the ""third worst person in the world.""  Becky is looking for anything to boost ratings, and Pomeroy's contract allows him to be forced into the morning show.This film lightly brings up the debate between ""News vs Entertainment"", tackled more seriously in films like ""Network"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" and even in comedies like ""Broadcast News"".  Pomeroy grates against being forced away from legitimate news. But while this is still a legitimate debate for evening news, I doubt anyone has a problem with morning news shows featuring segments with cooking and music and weathermen riding roller coasters. Spunky Becky tells grumbling Mike ""the debate between news and entertainment has been going on for DECADES!  Guess what?! Your side LOST!""The film's conflict comes when Goldblum informs McAdams that Daybreak's already bad ratings have fallen even lower since adding the resentful Pomeroy, and the network intends to cancel the show in six weeks.  Can perky Becky pull Daybreak's ratings up and save the show?  Will Pomeroy quit sulking long enough to join the team?  The film doesn't generate much suspense, but it has a few surprises, a delightful cast, and makes you glad to be in its company as you arrive at the final destination.",4,"Rachel McAdams carries a cast that includes Ford, Keaton and Goldblum",1295740800,"01 23, 2011",2011,3778,"['Make', 'mistake', 'being', 'surrounded', 'large', 'cast', 'featuring', 'film', 'icons', 'decades', 'experience', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'movie', 'film', 'similar', 'tone', 'countless', 'romantic', 'comedies', 'last', 'two', 'decades', 'other', 'few', 'superficial', 'dates', 'romance', 'backseat', 'story', 'McAdams', 'Becky', 'Fuller', 'Becky', 'late', 'twenties', 'apparently', 'WANTED', 'be', 'producer', 'big', 'morning', 'news', 'show', 'ever', 'was', 'little', 'girl', 'My', 'house', 'been', 'filled', 'four', 'daughters', 'knew', 'girls', 'similar', 'aspirations', 'McAdams', 'believe', 'Becky', 'pursuing', 'dream', 'sacrifice', 'sleep', 'boyfriends', 'reach', 'goal', 'One', 'great', 'charms', 'film', 'such', 'single-mindedly', 'devoted', 'career', 'person', 'likable', 'different', 'movie', 'sacrifice-everything-for-career', 'character', 'would', 'be', 'villain', 'McAdams', 'performance', 'want', 'succeed.The', 'start', 'not', 'promising', 'Becky', 'working', '4', 'a.m.', 'local', 'New', 'Jersey', 'show', 'expecting', 'promotion', 'when', 'instead', 'fired', 'producer', 'who', 'references', 'most', 'talented', 'producer', 'ever', 'had', 'fire', 'Becky', 'floods', 'New', 'York', 'applications', 'finally', 'invited', 'interview', 'morning', 'show', 'fictional', 'IBS', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'excellent', 'IBS', 'executive', 'who', 'heroine', 'encourages', 'pointing', 'out', 'show', 'worst', 'far', 'network', 'morning', 'shows', 'qualifications', 'are', 'least-impressive', 'various', 'candidates', 'McAdams', 'passionate', 'plea', 'Goldblum', 'decision', 'smart', 'Human', 'Resources', 'people', 'everywhere', 'candidate', 'passion', 'rather', 'best', 'credentials.Becky', 'thrown', 'hot', 'water', 'first', 'staff', 'meeting', 'think', 'head', 'staff', 'film', 'viewers', 'being', 'top', 'game', 'immediately.Diane', 'Keaton', 'terrific', 'pretty', 'thankless', 'role', 'face', 'Daybreak', 'years', 'who', 'seen', 'show', 'constantly', 'revolving', 'door', 'co-anchors', 'new', 'executive', 'producers', 'whole', 'time', 'Daybreak', 'bottom', 'ratings.Harrison', 'Ford', 'biggest', 'name', 'cast', 'Mike', 'Pomeroy', 'IBS', 'anchor', 'who', 'years', 'was', 'peer', 'Rather', 'Brokow', 'was', 'fired', 'anchor', 'evening', 'news', 'now', 'playing', 'out', 'end', 'six', 'million', 'dollar', 'two', 'year', 'contract', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'IBS', 'producer', 'ersatz', 'love', 'interest', 'Becky', 'Pomeroy', 'third', 'worst', 'person', 'world', 'Becky', 'looking', 'anything', 'boost', 'ratings', 'Pomeroy', 'contract', 'be', 'forced', 'morning', 'show.This', 'film', 'lightly', 'up', 'debate', 'News', 'vs', 'Entertainment', 'tackled', 'more', 'seriously', 'films', 'Network', 'Good', 'Night', 'Good', 'Luck', 'even', 'comedies', 'Broadcast', 'News', 'Pomeroy', 'being', 'forced', 'away', 'legitimate', 'news', 'still', 'legitimate', 'debate', 'evening', 'news', 'doubt', 'anyone', 'problem', 'morning', 'news', 'shows', 'featuring', 'segments', 'cooking', 'music', 'weathermen', 'riding', 'roller', 'coasters', 'Spunky', 'Becky', 'grumbling', 'Mike', 'debate', 'news', 'entertainment', 'been', 'going', 'DECADES', 'Guess', 'what', 'side', 'LOST', 'film', 'conflict', 'when', 'Goldblum', 'McAdams', 'Daybreak', 'already', 'bad', 'ratings', 'have', 'fallen', 'even', 'lower', 'adding', 'resentful', 'Pomeroy', 'network', 'cancel', 'show', 'six', 'weeks', 'Can', 'perky', 'Becky', 'pull', 'Daybreak', 'ratings', 'save', 'show', 'Will', 'Pomeroy', 'quit', 'sulking', 'long', 'enough', 'join', 'team', 'film', ""n't"", 'generate', 'much', 'suspense', 'few', 'surprises', 'delightful', 'cast', 'glad', 'be', 'company', 'arrive', 'final', 'destination']",N/A
1307449,A2DAHERP7HYJGO,B002ZG98FU,Mark Turner,"[21, 27]","Not many movies have been made focusing on network shows being made, even fewer still about network news. Perhaps the most well known was BROADCAST NEWS, a stand out movie that makes many best of list time and time again. While that movie focused on network news, I don't believe any film has chosen morning news programming until now. MORNING GLORY gives us a glimpse of that world in perhaps an off kilter way.Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) is an up and coming morning show producer in New Jersey just waiting for her big break. The day she thinks she's getting a promotion her world turns upside down. Instead her position is being condensed into another and the budget doesn't allow for two people. She's lost her job.With her mother recommending that she give up her dream, Becky sets out to prove her wrong. A number of ignored resumes later Becky gets a call from IBS and their morning show, Daybreak. The station is one of those small networks with no budgets and no hits. Daybreak falls behind every network competitor they have. Executive Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum) gives Becky the chance to turn it all around and to make the show something different.What Becky first discovers is that she's inherited a complete mess. One reporter who seems a bit dim, a weatherman who wants to do a story on wind vanes, an ex-Miss Arizona past her prime named Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton), an anchor with a foot fetish and a staff that tosses questions to her in rapid fire succession. Day one finds Becky taking the reins, answering all questions and firing the anchor. Now to get things rolling she simply has to find a new anchor. With no money and no budget. Better still would be using someone already under contract to IBS.Becky finds her man in the form of famed news journalist Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford). Pomeroy is a prize winning reporter currently doing bits for a news program that doesn't appreciate his past. Idolized by Becky, she sees her chance when she examines his contract and discovers a loophole that will result in his joining her show. But he doesn't go willingly.Instead Pomeroy does everything in his power to disrupt the morning news program he's been recruited for. Pomeroy is a bit pompous and feels the morning news show is below him. While Colleen is more than willing to do any story presented her, Pomeroy snubs any and all stories lobbed his way. Instead he simply reads the news in the most monotone voice possible and ignores the fluff pieces that Colleen does with relish.When Becky gets the word from Jerry that she's taken the show to the lowest ratings it's ever had and the show will be canceled in 6 weeks, she tosses caution to the wind and presents a more forceful producer than she did in the past. Her first act is to take the weatherman who was simply reporting on a new roller coaster and strap him in with a camera sending out his reactions over the air. This results in one of the funniest items in the movie but also angers Pomeroy.As Pomeroy and Becky go head to head, battling every step of the way, she gets coaching from her new boyfriend, one of the men behind the networks weekly news program. Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson) has a past with Pomeroy and a nickname I can't repeat here. He informs her that Pomeroy is the third worst human being in the world. But through his remarks Becky just may find a way to get Pomeroy on board and save the show. She has just 6 weeks to take it from the bottom of the heap and increase the ratings by 1.5 %. Can she do it?The movie moves along at a frantic pace and you may find yourself clutching the remote just to take it back a moment or two when you miss something. It does offer some hilarious moments along the way and you get the sense of family that develops among the staff of Daybreak. That's one of the things that brings a certain amount of charm to the whole film.The one troubling piece revolves around Ford as Pomeroy. Played incredibly straight faced and with more than enough bitterness to go around, Ford's portrayal of the newsman reduced to the morning slot shows a reporter devoid of emotion, a man who's lost himself in his work and never returned. At times this seems like the perfect way to portray this character. But at other times he just seems mean and nasty, the chances of him truly changing unlikely. Either this one of Ford's best performances or one of his worst.The movie doesn't offer any real depth to its characters or its story, but it is an enjoyable way to spend an evening. Its one of those guilty pleasures you watch only to know that it has little new to offer and can't be taken seriously. But its still fun. Its worth watching for the laughs and performances but won't leave you seeking a sequel.",3,MORNING STORY,1299715200,"03 10, 2011",2011,4735,"['Not', 'many', 'movies', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'focusing', 'network', 'shows', 'being', 'made', 'even', 'fewer', 'still', 'network', 'news', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'well', 'known', 'was', 'BROADCAST', 'NEWS', 'stand', 'out', 'movie', 'many', 'best', 'list', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'movie', 'focused', 'network', 'news', 'do', ""n't"", 'believe', 'film', 'chosen', 'morning', 'news', 'programming', 'now', 'MORNING', 'GLORY', 'glimpse', 'world', 'perhaps', 'off', 'kilter', 'way.Becky', 'Fuller', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'up', 'coming', 'morning', 'show', 'producer', 'New', 'Jersey', 'just', 'waiting', 'big', 'break', 'day', 'getting', 'promotion', 'world', 'upside', 'down', 'Instead', 'position', 'being', 'condensed', 'budget', ""n't"", 'allow', 'two', 'people', 'lost', 'job.With', 'mother', 'recommending', 'give', 'up', 'dream', 'Becky', 'out', 'prove', 'wrong', 'number', 'ignored', 'resumes', 'later', 'Becky', 'call', 'IBS', 'morning', 'show', 'Daybreak', 'station', 'one', 'small', 'networks', 'budgets', 'hits', 'Daybreak', 'network', 'competitor', 'have', 'Executive', 'Jerry', 'Barnes', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'Becky', 'chance', 'turn', 'around', 'make', 'show', 'something', 'different.What', 'Becky', 'first', 'discovers', 'inherited', 'complete', 'mess', 'One', 'reporter', 'who', 'bit', 'dim', 'weatherman', 'who', 'do', 'story', 'wind', 'vanes', 'ex-Miss', 'Arizona', 'prime', 'named', 'Colleen', 'Peck', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'anchor', 'foot', 'fetish', 'staff', 'questions', 'rapid', 'fire', 'succession', 'Day', 'one', 'Becky', 'taking', 'reins', 'answering', 'questions', 'firing', 'anchor', 'Now', 'get', 'things', 'rolling', 'simply', 'find', 'new', 'anchor', 'money', 'budget', 'Better', 'still', 'would', 'be', 'using', 'someone', 'already', 'contract', 'IBS.Becky', 'man', 'form', 'famed', 'news', 'journalist', 'Mike', 'Pomeroy', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Pomeroy', 'prize', 'winning', 'reporter', 'currently', 'doing', 'bits', 'news', 'program', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'past', 'Idolized', 'Becky', 'chance', 'when', 'contract', 'loophole', 'will', 'result', 'joining', 'show', ""n't"", 'go', 'willingly.Instead', 'Pomeroy', 'everything', 'power', 'disrupt', 'morning', 'news', 'program', 'been', 'recruited', 'Pomeroy', 'bit', 'pompous', 'morning', 'news', 'show', 'Colleen', 'more', 'willing', 'do', 'story', 'presented', 'Pomeroy', 'stories', 'lobbed', 'way', 'Instead', 'simply', 'news', 'most', 'monotone', 'voice', 'possible', 'fluff', 'pieces', 'Colleen', 'relish.When', 'Becky', 'word', 'Jerry', 'taken', 'show', 'lowest', 'ratings', 'ever', 'had', 'show', 'will', 'be', 'canceled', '6', 'weeks', 'caution', 'wind', 'more', 'forceful', 'producer', 'did', 'past', 'Her', 'first', 'act', 'take', 'weatherman', 'who', 'was', 'simply', 'reporting', 'new', 'roller', 'coaster', 'strap', 'camera', 'sending', 'out', 'reactions', 'air', 'results', 'one', 'funniest', 'items', 'movie', 'also', 'angers', 'Pomeroy.As', 'Pomeroy', 'Becky', 'go', 'head', 'head', 'battling', 'step', 'way', 'coaching', 'new', 'boyfriend', 'one', 'men', 'networks', 'weekly', 'news', 'program', 'Adam', 'Bennett', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'past', 'Pomeroy', 'nickname', 'ca', ""n't"", 'repeat', 'here', 'Pomeroy', 'third', 'worst', 'human', 'being', 'world', 'remarks', 'Becky', 'just', 'may', 'find', 'way', 'get', 'Pomeroy', 'board', 'save', 'show', 'just', '6', 'weeks', 'take', 'bottom', 'heap', 'increase', 'ratings', '1.5', '%', 'Can', 'do', 'movie', 'along', 'frantic', 'pace', 'may', 'find', 'clutching', 'remote', 'just', 'take', 'back', 'moment', 'two', 'when', 'miss', 'something', 'offer', 'hilarious', 'moments', 'way', 'get', 'sense', 'family', 'staff', 'Daybreak', 'one', 'things', 'certain', 'amount', 'charm', 'whole', 'film.The', 'one', 'troubling', 'piece', 'revolves', 'around', 'Ford', 'Pomeroy', 'Played', 'incredibly', 'straight', 'faced', 'more', 'enough', 'bitterness', 'go', 'around', 'Ford', 'portrayal', 'newsman', 'reduced', 'morning', 'slot', 'reporter', 'devoid', 'emotion', 'man', 'who', 'lost', 'work', 'never', 'returned', 'times', 'perfect', 'way', 'portray', 'character', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'mean', 'nasty', 'chances', 'truly', 'changing', 'unlikely', 'one', 'Ford', 'best', 'performances', 'one', 'worst.The', 'movie', ""n't"", 'offer', 'real', 'depth', 'characters', 'story', 'enjoyable', 'way', 'spend', 'evening', 'one', 'guilty', 'pleasures', 'watch', 'only', 'know', 'little', 'new', 'offer', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'taken', 'seriously', 'still', 'fun', 'worth', 'watching', 'laughs', 'performances', 'wo', ""n't"", 'leave', 'seeking', 'sequel']",N/A

The way that she reacted to that gesture by running back to the studio (with the camera focusing on her legs in a rather suggestive way) almost conveyed the impression that she was in love with Ford's character romantically instead of sort of like a grumpy father figure.Fortunately, the movie didn't end with her falling into Ford's arms (which would have been a bit ludicrous given the age disparity) but the movie conveyed that impression that it might happen with the way it staged that last scene.&lt;end spoilers>See it for Rachel McAdams (who is very pretty and delightful) and for Harrison Ford playing someone who did not always come across as a sympathetic character.",3,"Decent, albeit with an odd lead up to its predictable ending",1323302400,"12 8, 2011",2011,1528,"['Morning', 'Glory', 'nothing', 'new', 'sort', 'modern', 'day', 'Horatio', 'Alger', 'story', 'heroine', 'good', 'sheer', 'pluck', 'spunk', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'good', 'job', 'playing', 'character', 'veteran', 'stars', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'backing', 'up', 'anchors', 'morning', 'show', 'Adams', 'executive', 'producer', 'Ford', 'type', 'being', 'dour', 'serious', 'news', 'anchor', 'who', 'McAdams', 'corrals', 'show', 'also', 'nice', 'see', 'Jeff', 'Goldblume', 'still', 'working', 'role', 'McAdams', 'boss', '.This', 'being', 'said', 'entirely', 'predictable', 'terms', 'plot', 'ultimate', 'outcome', 'one', 'minor', 'exception.', 'lt', 'spoilers', '>', 'thing', 'got', 'confused', 'was', 'climactic', 'moment', 'where', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'character', 'grand', 'gesture', 'urging', 'McAdams', 'stay', 'show', 'instead', 'going', 'Good', 'Morning', 'America', 'way', 'reacted', 'gesture', 'running', 'back', 'studio', 'camera', 'focusing', 'legs', 'rather', 'suggestive', 'way', 'almost', 'conveyed', 'impression', 'was', 'love', 'Ford', 'character', 'romantically', 'instead', 'sort', 'grumpy', 'father', 'figure.Fortunately', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'end', 'falling', 'Ford', 'arms', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'bit', 'ludicrous', 'given', 'age', 'disparity', 'movie', 'conveyed', 'impression', 'might', 'happen', 'way', 'staged', 'last', 'scene.', 'lt', 'end', 'spoilers', '>', 'See', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'who', 'very', 'pretty', 'delightful', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'playing', 'someone', 'who', 'did', 'not', 'always', 'come', 'sympathetic', 'character']",N/A

1307465,A1BQTYVTL2W9RN,B002ZG98FU,N. S. Michael,"[1, 1]","I suppose that's not the most diplomatic way for me to frame how I describe her go-getting morning show executive producer, but the person she is portraying can be, most certainly, scattered. She obsesses over her work (and what modern working woman in The City That Never Sleeps doesn't), she flits from idea to idea at a early afternoon first date dinner (whom she manages to scare off in mere minutes), and can't quite decide when to silence her meandering babbles in front of anyone, let alone her future boss (Jeff Goldblum), a ratings driven executive who may or may not be ready to take a chance on her.Still, McAdams plays the part of almost thirty-something Becky, who seeks to rebound from being replaced at her local Jersey affiliate morning show (by a pedigreed blueblood named Chad, no less) via a Hail Mary throw at the big leagues of New York City's (fictional) channel IBS early morning Daybreak, pretty darn well. Montage scenes have her throwing resumes to the wind, with follow up calls one on top of the other... but she gets her shot. And while Daybreak may be the worst rated morning show of the fold, she hits the ground running, finagling the distinguished Michael Pomeroy (Harrison Ford) to co-anchor with show veteran Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton).Both Mike and Colleen are the quintessential prima donnas of their respective backgrounds; Mike the ever serious hardnews reporter in the vein of Brokaw, Rather and Cronkite and Colleen is morning show royalty, having held the chair for decades running fluff piece after fluff piece with the style and poise that won her the Ms. Arizona pageant lo those many years ago. Together they are fire and gunpowder agreeing only on the pride they have in how they view their respective careers.Added to the craziness is the apparently necessary love interest in Adam Bennett (Patrick Wilson), a story editor for a 60 Minutes lookalike magazine show and the fated man with whom our fair Becky clicks with almost immediately only to waffle back and forth over throughout the entirety of the movie. To me, it was a tacked on romance that doesn't really seem to serve anything other than the message that you can't just have work to hold on to... especially late at night when the dark eats away at you. Still, Rachel looked fabulous in the designer lingerie she wore for him on their second date, but that's neither here nor there.*ahem*Morning Glory is filled with solid... and I mean ROCK SOLID actors in very believable roles that they fill entirely too well. Even Ty Burrell in his tiny, kinda pervy outgoing anchor role worked great. And don't get me started on Diane Keaton. Her arc from frustrated diva to gung-ho supporter even while keeping her nails sharp for raking against Ford's hide is delightful (though I could have done without her joining 50 Cent's posse for a late movie segment... but that's just the sort of ridiculous stunt morning shows tend to pull).Unfortunately, the feeling of the movie overall is as scattered as the main character. The main forces and conflicts between Becky and her hostage anchor Mike lack a believable rhythm. She ambushes him, he relents dragging his feet, he retaliates, and she counters. It's all very formula, but it's all very lacking. Little moments where there should be a connection almost seem to be there, but fall to the wayside as the story marches on in its far too brisk pace. Little seeds are sown early in the movie; Becky's mother is embarrassed for her, Mike cooks and lectures over a frittata, and it all screams ""well THIS is climax material"" and it is. And while the movie shouldn't suffer for it, and should actually revel in these little touches, I can't help but feel like they're afterthoughts.There is plenty of mild satire on the state of the News in modern America, but it just doesn't fit in the sort of ""coming-in-to-her-own"" feel good movie they tried to make here. It's like bits and pieces of Network, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, and a Julia Roberts/Sandra Bullock movie were thrown into a blender and only the best bits of each one were served. Sure, it's the good stuff, but they don't gel together well.Now... I do want to say that director Roger Michell did a pretty good job. This is a decent bit of filmmaking he and JJ Abrams'  Bad Robot crew have made here, but it's not perfect. From the minute I saw that logo I expected excellence and what was presented came a little close, but not close enough.Still... I liked it better than Notting Hill. Three Stars.While I have a moment, I want to give a quick shout out to John Pankow (whom I haven't seen since Mad About You ended) as a great assistant producer to back up McAdams. Honestly, this guy has great acting chops and it's amazing I haven't seen him in anything since the 90's.",3,Rachel McAdams is a very convincing spaz.,1302566400,"04 12, 2011",2011,4781,"['suppose',

Harrison Ford perfectly plays the aged reporter who is contractually obligated to host a morning talk show alongside Diane Keaton (I still can't be sure which part of this idea appeals to him less) with McAdams behind the scenes as the show's workiholic producer...sidenote, Jeff Goldblume was awsome as her boss who wanted to be behind her but needed the ratings to justify himself.  It's a crime that he wasn't given more screen time.  Anyway, Ford portrays his struggle to continue to be taken serious as a journalist, going so far as to kidnap McAdams (hey, he stole my idea) in order to expose the governor's illegal activities (the Governor of New York involved in something illegal?  Wonder what gave them that idea.)  McAdams is awsome as the fierce producer who seeks to keep everyone, including Ford, in line and to boost the show's ratings.

I watched this movie because I felt the low reviews were misguided. I am a fan of Harrison Ford, and I believed that he would not be involved in a low-grade movie.I was correct. This is an outstanding romantic comedy! It is what instant classics are made of. McAdams, Ford, Keaton and crew are stellar. You will laugh and you will cry; not sad tears but happy tears. I don't believe in spoiling the movie so I will leave this a brief review void of spoilers. I will state that if you are looking for an even-headed comedy, an entertaining movie with well-developed characters that quickly draw you into the story; this is an excellent choice. I highly recommend it for anyone who likes this genre.A word on genre: this is a romantic comedy. It is not raw, stand-up comedy. It is not today's raunchy comedy - laced with toilet and drug humor. If you want THAT, skip THIS. You are better served with BALLS OUT, THE HANGOVER or perhaps PINEAPPLE EXPRESS.

She changes some of the show format and brings in a new co-anchor played by Harrison Ford.  He is serious and dour and only wants to report on the news that will win him awards and which he deems newsworthy.  There is also a love interest thread thrown in for good measure.The trailer made `Morning Glory' seem way more funnier than it actually is and whilst I laughed out loud a few times, it was disappointing overall.  It kind of feels as if the writer and director didn't want to think too hard with this project and it is film-making `by numbers'.  It feels formulaic and clich&eacute;d.  McAdams is really good and what saves this film from being truly awful, but Harrison is unremarkable and a disappointment.  His accent is annoying and his acting is wooden and uninspiring.  Diane Keaton is great as the co-anchor and she always adds something to any film she stars in.All in all this is an ok film, but nothing truly outstanding.  I felt more disappointed than I should have after watching the trailer and expecting great things (but that's the job of a trailer I guess).  The love interest aspect is superfluous and whilst relatively charming it doesn't add a great deal to the film.

1307501,AV5G37VFE5NVD,B002ZG98FU,Tom Benton,"[0, 1]","""Morning Glory"" seems like a despicable film.  It's the brainchild of seasoned rom-com pro Aline Brosh McKenna, who was also responsible for writing ""Laws of Attraction,"" with Pierce Brosnan and Julianne Moore, ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" with Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway, and ""27 Dresses,"" with Katherine Heigl.  McKenna knows what makes today's Hollywood rom-coms, but more importantly, she knows what gets today's rom-coms made.  ""Morning Glory"" is a well-constructed script: it follows the tried-and-old formula of the modern rom-com, while also leaving the possibility of snagging big talent (and thus a bigger audience)--in this case, Diane Keaton and Harrison Ford.Rachel McAdams stars as a 28-year-old working for a New Jersey morning show, who's dreamed of getting into big-time broadcast journalism since she was 8.  She gets fired from her Jersey morning show and receives a brutally cold lecture from her mother, but she immediately begins a desperate search for a new job.  She gets one, by impressing a big-wig exec played by Jeff Goldblum: she's the new executive-producer on the cruddy morning show Daylight.  There's no need to waste time explaining what happens from there, or the challenges she faces.  One can see it coming.What I didn't see coming was McKenna's wrong-mindedness.  Harrison Ford plays a Walter-Cronkite-quality news anchor who gets fired and winds up contractually bound to Daylight.  He insists on covering real news stories, things of national or international importance.  He's supposed to seem an ""a--hole"" for doing so, for not providing the trivial, superficial entertainment Daylight viewers expect.  McAdams informs him that the battle between entertainment and news is over: ""Entertainment won.""  Are we supposed to laugh at the declaration?  How can any intelligent person see Ford's ideas as being that of an old fuddy-duddy, as McKenna does?McAdams' character's achievement is raising the ratings for Daylight and turning it into a show about which people care.  She does so by transforming the show into an entertainment hour, in which the weather forecaster is forced to endure a new rollercoaster or skydiving and Diane Keaton's character has to sumo wrestle and kiss a frog.  She's raised the ratings, which makes her some kind of success, and that's nice because Rachel McAdams is a likable actor--but she's done so by shirking journalistic duty for sensational, goofy entertainment.  Why would we applaud this?McKenna's script just gets more simple-minded from there.  Characters have sudden, inexplicable changes of heart, for the sake of convenient plotting.  She spends an hour showing us how stubborn and obnoxious Ford's character can be, then gives him an apparently complete turnaround in 15 minutes.  We get a nice shot of McAdams' character's mother, the insensitive, cruel one, proudly hanging a news clipping about McAdams' success.  Why do we care?  Does this really make us happy?  She isn't proud of McAdams: she's proud of McAdams' success.Why is McAdams' character attracted to Patrick Wilson's lazy upper-level magazine series journalist?  McKenna tells us it's because he puts up with her, but aren't there tens of thousands of men in the world who would be willing to put up with McAdams' character, let alone McAdams herself?  Isn't it possible someone might not just tolerate the character, but love her for her drive or her eccentricities--you know, the human stuff?Not in McKenna's manufactured world, which fortunately has little to do with life as I know it.  Rom-coms are usually devoid of characters or storylines with human quality, since the genre itself relies on superficial targets to elicit its audience's pleasure.  But they can still be lively (""Bridget Jones's Diary""), or clever (anything by Judd Apatow), or even meaningful (""Definitely, Maybe"").  ""Morning Glory"" is none of the above.  It's as familiar as the formula of ""Sesame Street,"" without such good intentions.  It seems as though one owns the piano score on a dozen different soundtrack CDs.There is one redeeming feature of ""Morning Glory"" (although there should be two: Diane Keaton is surprisingly misused): Harrison Ford, whose performance is unfathomably fun, funny, and emotional considering the shallowness of the material.  Hollywood is really enjoying itself, milking Mr. Ford for his Grumpy Old Man quality, but in this movie, his sulking curmudgeonly performance makes all the difference in the world--the world being the thing about which ""Morning Glory"" doesn't know a thing, nor care.",2,Unglorious bastard,1312156800,"08 1, 2011",2011,4550,"['Morning', 'Glory', 'despicable', 'film', 'brainchild', 'seasoned', 'rom-com', 'pro', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'responsible', 'writing', 'Laws', 'Attraction', 'Pierce', 'Brosnan', 'Julianne', 'Moore', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', 'Meryl', 'Streep', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', '27', 'Dresses', 'Katherine', 'Heigl', 'McKenna', 'what', 'today', 'Hollywood', 'rom-coms', 'more', 'importantly', 'what', 'today', 'rom-coms', 'made', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'well-constructed', 'script', 'tried-and-old', 'formula', 'modern', 'rom-com', 'also', 'leaving', 'possibility', 'snagging', 'big', 'talent', 'thus', 'bigger', 'audience', 'case', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'Harrison', 'Ford.Rachel', 'McAdams', '28-year-old', 'working', 'New', 'Jersey', 'morning', 'show', 'who', 'dreamed', 'getting', 'big-time', 'broadcast', 'journalism', 'was', '8', 'fired', 'Jersey', 'morning', 'show', 'brutally', 'cold', 'lecture', 'mother', 'immediately', 'desperate', 'search', 'new', 'job', 'one', 'impressing', 'big-wig', 'exec', 'played', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'new', 'executive-producer', 'cruddy', 'morning', 'show', 'Daylight', 'need', 'waste', 'time', 'explaining', 'what', 'there', 'challenges', 'One', 'can', 'see', 'coming.What', 'did', ""n't"", 'see', 'coming', 'was', 'McKenna', 'wrong-mindedness', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'Walter-Cronkite-quality', 'news', 'anchor', 'who', 'fired', 'up', 'contractually', 'Daylight', 'covering', 'real', 'news', 'stories', 'things', 'national', 'international', 'importance', 'supposed', 'seem', 'hole', 'doing', 'so', 'not', 'providing', 'trivial', 'superficial', 'entertainment', 'Daylight', 'viewers', 'expect', 'McAdams', 'battle', 'entertainment', 'news', 'Entertainment', 'won', 'Are', 'supposed', 'laugh', 'declaration', 'How', 'can', 'intelligent', 'person', 'see', 'Ford', 'ideas', 'being', 'old', 'fuddy-duddy', 'McKenna', 'McAdams', 'character', 'achievement', 'raising', 'ratings', 'Daylight', 'turning', 'show', 'people', 'care', 'so', 'transforming', 'show', 'entertainment', 'hour', 'weather', 'forecaster', 'forced', 'endure', 'new', 'rollercoaster', 'skydiving', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'character', 'sumo', 'wrestle', 'kiss', 'frog', 'raised', 'ratings', 'kind', 'success', 'nice', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'likable', 'actor', 'done', 'so', 'shirking', 'journalistic', 'duty', 'sensational', 'goofy', 'entertainment', 'Why', 'would', 'applaud', 'McKenna', 'script', 'just', 'more', 'simple-minded', 'there', 'Characters', 'have', 'sudden', 'inexplicable', 'changes', 'heart', 'sake', 'convenient', 'plotting', 'hour', 'showing', 'how', 'stubborn', 'obnoxious', 'Ford', 'character', 'can', 'be', 'then', 'apparently', 'complete', 'turnaround', '15', 'minutes', 'get', 'nice', 'shot', 'McAdams', 'character', 'mother', 'insensitive', 'cruel', 'one', 'proudly', 'hanging', 'news', 'clipping', 'McAdams', 'success', 'Why', 'do', 'care', 'Does', 'really', 'make', 'happy', ""n't"", 'proud', 'McAdams', 'proud', 'McAdams', 'success.Why', 'McAdams', 'character', 'attracted', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'lazy', 'upper-level', 'magazine', 'series', 'journalist', 'McKenna', 'up', 'are', ""n't"", 'there', 'tens', 'thousands', 'men', 'world', 'who', 'would', 'be', 'willing', 'put', 'up', 'McAdams', 'character', 'let', 'alone', 'McAdams', ""n't"", 'possible', 'someone', 'might', 'not', 'just', 'tolerate', 'character', 'love', 'drive', 'eccentricities', 'know', 'human', 'stuff', 'Not', 'McKenna', 'manufactured', 'world', 'fortunately', 'little', 'do', 'life', 'know', 'Rom-coms', 'are', 'usually', 'devoid', 'characters', 'storylines', 'human', 'quality', 'genre', 'superficial', 'targets', 'elicit', 'audience', 'pleasure', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'lively', 'Bridget', 'Jones', 'Diary', 'clever', 'anything', 'Judd', 'Apatow', 'even', 'meaningful', 'Definitely', 'Maybe', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'none', 'above', 'as', 'familiar', 'formula', 'Sesame', 'Street', 'such', 'good', 'intentions', 'one', 'piano', 'score', 'dozen', 'different', 'soundtrack', 'CDs.There', 'one', 'redeeming', 'feature', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'should', 'be', 'two', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'surprisingly', 'misused', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'performance', 'unfathomably', 'fun', 'funny', 'emotional', 'considering', 'shallowness', 'material', 'Hollywood', 'really', 'enjoying', 'milking', 'Mr.', 'Ford', 'Grumpy', 'Old', 'Man', 'quality', 'movie', 'sulking', 'curmudgeonly', 'performance', 'difference', 'world', 'world', 'being', 'thing', 'Morning', 'Glory', ""n't"", 'know', 'thing', 'care']",N/A

This time around the romantic comedy's heroine is Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams), an aspiring morning show producer of a national TV network, who has to deal with very difficult people.The most difficult person happens to be Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), a curmudgeonly veteran journalist and Pulitzer Prize winner, who accepts his new job as a host of a TV show DayBreak just because of money. According to Adam (Patrick Wilson), another producer and love interest of Becky, Mike Pomeroy is the third worst person in the world and Adam is not obviously joking. To make matters worse, he simply doesn't like the show's longtime personality Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton), and he is not willing to hide it even before the camera.Like Anne Hathaway's Andy in ""Prada,"" Rachel McAdams plays a feisty and overall likable heroine effortlessly, but some might find her a bit too feisty. Her character goes to extraordinary lengths to boost the show's sagging ratings, which is amusing to see, but with her underdeveloped back story, we are not allowed to know much about this charming heroine. The subplot about her romance with Adam is terribly underwritten.Unlike such films as ""Network,"" ""Morning Glory"" does not offer satire of or insight into the TV industry, which is fine with me. Directed by Roger Michell (""Notting Hill""), ""Morning Glory"" is sweet and charming enough as a comedy, but as a romance it is disappointing.",3,"Amusing Comedy from the Director of ""Notting Hill"" and the Writer of ""The Devil Wears Prada""",1298851200,"02 28, 2011",2011,1563,"['screenplay', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'penned', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'better', 'known', 'works', 'including', 'Devil', 'Wears', 'Prada', '27', 'Dresses', 'time', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'heroine', 'Becky', 'Fuller', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'aspiring', 'morning', 'show', 'producer', 'national', 'TV', 'network', 'who', 'deal', 'very', 'difficult', 'people.The', 'most', 'difficult', 'person', 'be', 'Mike', 'Pomeroy', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'curmudgeonly', 'veteran', 'journalist', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'winner', 'who', 'new', 'job', 'host', 'TV', 'show', 'DayBreak', 'just', 'money', 'According', 'Adam', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'producer', 'love', 'interest', 'Becky', 'Mike', 'Pomeroy', 'third', 'worst', 'person', 'world', 'Adam', 'not', 'obviously', 'joking', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'simply', ""n't"", 'like', 'show', 'longtime', 'personality', 'Colleen', 'Peck', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'not', 'willing', 'hide', 'even', 'camera.Like', 'Anne', 'Hathaway', 'Andy', 'Prada', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'feisty', 'overall', 'likable', 'heroine', 'effortlessly', 'might', 'find', 'bit', 'too', 'feisty', 'character', 'extraordinary', 'lengths', 'boost', 'show', 'sagging', 'ratings', 'amusing', 'see', 'underdeveloped', 'back', 'story', 'are', 'not', 'allowed', 'know', 'much', 'charming', 'heroine', 'subplot', 'romance', 'Adam', 'terribly', 'underwritten.Unlike', 'such', 'films', 'Network', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'not', 'offer', 'satire', 'insight', 'TV', 'industry', 'fine', 'Directed', 'Roger', 'Michell', 'Notting', 'Hill', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'sweet', 'charming', 'enough', 'comedy', 'romance', 'disappointing']",N/A
1307505,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,B002ZG98FU,Turfseer,"[3, 9]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna bit off quite a bit more than she could chew by attempting to top her excellent 'Devil Wears Prada' with the weak romantic-comedy, 'Morning Glory'. Immediately one must suspend one's disbelief by accepting the idea that there is a morning talk show called 'Daybreak' on a fictional TV network called IBS. McKenna posits this 'Daybreak' as a competitor to the real-life 'Today' show. We're asked to accept that Daybreak has been chugging along in fourth place in the ratings for quite awhile and is peopled with co-hosts such as Paul McVee who happens to have a foot fetish (I've heard of egotistical newscasters but no network would keep a pervert and sexual harasser on their payroll under any circumstances).I also found it odd that Jerry Barnes (Jeff Goldblum) would give Becky Fuller (Rachel McAdams) carte blanche to fire an anchorman without review from the top office. After all, she has no experience as a producer on a big TV network and she's just been hired. When she cans McVee, everyone seems relieved that she takes the big step in firing a pervert. Where was Barnes in all this? He seems like a strong executive but is content to delegate his authority to the point where he allows a young upstart to make big decisions such as firing a co-host without his input?Even if one accepts the cartoon world that McKenna offers up here, the bulk of Morning Glory features the unfunny attempt on the part of Fuller to convince legendary anchorman Mike Pomeroy to ""lighten up"". Unfortunately, Harrison Ford has little to work with in the character of Pomeroy. He's introduced as an even more embittered Dan Rather type who self-righteously insists that morning talk shows are way beneath him. We're treated to his bromides past the midpoint of the film and Ford's depiction of Pomeroy as a churlish misanthrope with that gruff Clint Eastwood voice, wears out its welcome quite quickly.The dopey romance between Becky and Adam (Patrick Wilson), who whines about his significant other's workaholic ways, does little to lighten the heavy handed banter between the two principals. The comedy actually doesn't get going until about three quarters of the film is complete. That's when Coleen Peck (Diane Keaton) and the rest of the Daybreak team (sans Pomeroy) decide to throw caution to the wind and now work completely out of the box. This is the only real fun part of the movie. Mike Malloy as Ernie the weather-caster, steals the show when he gets to do the weather while riding a Six Flags roller-coaster. There are a few other mildly amusing bits such as Peck going toe to toe with a Sumo Wrestler.After Becky berates Pomeroy for the umpteenth time, he finally decides that sitting on his laurels is simply a strategy to indulge himself in a prolonged campaign of self-pity. So Pomeroy drags Becky upstate where he proves to her that he's not a has-been: Pomeroy lands the exclusive story of the governor's arrest on corruption charges. Somehow, this short breaking news item is enough to bump up the ratings so that Barnes doesn't have the cancel the show. It takes one more dressing down from Becky after Pomeroy reverts to his misanthropic ways. Now all is well in TV land. Pomeroy makes a great omelet and the ratings go through the roof! You would have thought that screenwriter McKenna would have come up with some better ideas to illustrate Daybreak's resurrection, instead of the mundane arrest of a sitting governor on corruption charges and an aging anchorman showing off his cooking skills.Rachel Adams is her usual perky self and gives a fun performance as the intrepid junior producer. But coupled with the dour Ford, the relationship between the two is veritable kryptonite. When all is said and done, Morning Glory has little 'glory' at all. And come to think of it, it's not very funny either!",2,Relationship between misanthropic anchorman and upstart producer is veritable kryptonite,1290816000,"11 27, 2010",2010,3888,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Screenwriter', 'Aline', 'Brosh', 'McKenna', 'bit', 'off', 'quite', 'bit', 'more', 'could', 'chew', 'attempting', 'top', 'excellent', ""'Devil"", 'Wears', 'Prada', 'weak', 'romantic-comedy', ""'Morning"", 'Glory', 'Immediately', 'one', 'must', 'suspend', 'one', 'disbelief', 'accepting', 'idea', 'morning', 'talk', 'show', 'called', ""'Daybreak"", 'fictional', 'TV', 'network', 'called', 'IBS', 'McKenna', ""'Daybreak"", 'competitor', 'real-life', ""'Today"", 'show', ""'re"", 'asked', 'accept', 'Daybreak', 'been', 'chugging', 'along', 'fourth', 'place', 'ratings', 'quite', 'awhile', 'peopled', 'co-hosts', 'such', 'Paul', 'McVee', 'who', 'have', 'foot', 'fetish', ""'ve"", 'heard', 'egotistical', 'newscasters', 'network', 'would', 'keep', 'pervert', 'sexual', 'harasser', 'payroll', 'circumstances', '.I', 'also', 'found', 'Jerry', 'Barnes', 'Jeff', 'Goldblum', 'would', 'give', 'Becky', 'Fuller', 'Rachel', 'McAdams', 'carte', 'blanche', 'fire', 'anchorman', 'review', 'top', 'office', 'experience', 'producer', 'big', 'TV', 'network', 'just', 'been', 'hired', 'When', 'McVee', 'everyone', 'relieved', 'big', 'step', 'firing', 'pervert', 'Where', 'was', 'Barnes', 'strong', 'executive', 'content', 'delegate', 'authority', 'point', 'where', 'young', 'upstart', 'make', 'big', 'decisions', 'such', 'firing', 'co-host', 'input', 'Even', 'one', 'cartoon', 'world', 'McKenna', 'here', 'bulk', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'unfunny', 'attempt', 'part', 'Fuller', 'convince', 'legendary', 'anchorman', 'Mike', 'Pomeroy', 'lighten', 'up', 'Unfortunately', 'Harrison', 'Ford', 'little', 'work', 'character', 'Pomeroy', 'introduced', 'even', 'more', 'embittered', 'Dan', 'Rather', 'type', 'who', 'self-righteously', 'morning', 'talk', 'shows', 'are', 'way', ""'re"", 'treated', 'bromides', 'midpoint', 'film', 'Ford', 'depiction', 'Pomeroy', 'churlish', 'misanthrope', 'gruff', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'voice', 'out', 'welcome', 'quite', 'quickly.The', 'dopey', 'romance', 'Becky', 'Adam', 'Patrick', 'Wilson', 'who', 'significant', 'other', 'workaholic', 'ways', 'little', 'lighten', 'heavy', 'handed', 'banter', 'two', 'principals', 'comedy', 'actually', ""n't"", 'get', 'going', 'three', 'quarters', 'film', 'complete', 'when', 'Coleen', 'Peck', 'Diane', 'Keaton', 'rest', 'Daybreak', 'team', 'sans', 'Pomeroy', 'decide', 'throw', 'caution', 'wind', 'now', 'work', 'completely', 'box', 'only', 'real', 'fun', 'part', 'movie', 'Mike', 'Malloy', 'Ernie', 'weather-caster', 'show', 'when', 'do', 'weather', 'riding', 'Six', 'Flags', 'roller-coaster', 'are', 'few', 'other', 'mildly', 'amusing', 'bits', 'such', 'Peck', 'going', 'toe', 'toe', 'Sumo', 'Wrestler.After', 'Becky', 'Pomeroy', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'finally', 'sitting', 'laurels', 'simply', 'strategy', 'indulge', 'prolonged', 'campaign', 'self-pity', 'Pomeroy', 'Becky', 'upstate', 'where', 'not', 'has-been', 'Pomeroy', 'exclusive', 'story', 'governor', 'arrest', 'corruption', 'charges', 'Somehow', 'short', 'breaking', 'news', 'item', 'enough', 'bump', 'up', 'ratings', 'Barnes', ""n't"", 'have', 'cancel', 'show', 'one', 'more', 'dressing', 'down', 'Becky', 'Pomeroy', 'misanthropic', 'ways', 'Now', 'well', 'TV', 'land', 'Pomeroy', 'great', 'omelet', 'ratings', 'go', 'roof', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'screenwriter', 'McKenna', 'would', 'have', 'come', 'up', 'better', 'ideas', 'illustrate', 'Daybreak', 'resurrection', 'instead', 'mundane', 'arrest', 'sitting', 'governor', 'corruption', 'charges', 'aging', 'anchorman', 'showing', 'off', 'cooking', 'skills.Rachel', 'Adams', 'usual', 'perky', 'self', 'fun', 'performance', 'intrepid', 'junior', 'producer', 'coupled', 'dour', 'Ford', 'relationship', 'two', 'veritable', 'kryptonite', 'When', 'said', 'done', 'Morning', 'Glory', 'little', ""'glory"", 'come', 'think', 'not', 'very', 'funny']",N/A

1307509,AP3B615GM191G,B002ZG98FU,"Zachary Koenig ""K-Dawg""","[3, 4]","When the trailer for ""Morning Glory"" first hit the airwaves, it looked like a fun little film.  Rachel McAdams plays a spunky journalist, Harrison Ford lends his big-screen gravitas to the project, and the entire project is produced by JJ Abrams.  Unfortunately, this is one of those cases in which the trailer shows all the best parts of the film.  Beyond that, there really isn't much.For a basic plot summary, ""Morning Glory"" focuses on Becky Fuller (McAdams), a workaholic TV journalist who gets fired from her cushy position and thus takes a job at the lowest-rating morning news show on the air.  In order to turn the show around, she reaches out to news anchor ""legend"" Mike Pomeroy (Ford), whose gruff exterior threatens to destroy the entire project.The trouble with this movie is that director Roger Michell never allows us to truly feel for the characters, as they are so cliched and one-dimensional.  He tries to develop McAdams' go-getter character, but she's so over the top as to be almost laughable.  Ford's character is almost a walking cliche of ""hard news"" grumpiness.  Even the romantic angle that should (with a better script) tie the characters together instead falls flat and wastes many precious minutes.The one redeeming factor in ""Morning Glory"" is the performance by Harrison Ford.  Though he seems to be an odd choice for the part, as his actual news anchor scenes are not convincing whatsoever, just his incredible acting talent in general carries the entire film on his shoulders.  When he isn't on the screen, you'll be wishing he was, as that is when things are funny and interesting.Overall, I found this movie to be quite disappointing.
