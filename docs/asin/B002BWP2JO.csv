1260704,AKZGOBZGR1WA3,B002BWP2JO,A.K.A. Me,"[8, 10]","I have seen reviewers compare this show to the caper shows of the late sixties and seventies, and caper would definitely be the way to describe the basic premise, but this show is so much more. It is complex, sophisticated, fast-paced and at times very funny. It is GREAT entertainment, pure and simple. The cast is first-rate, they work together flawlessly, and they all seem to have a natural affinity for their characters' skills.The basic premise is a group of loners with well-honed skills - a grifter, a hacker, a ""hitter,"" and a thief - are brought together to do one job, and one job only, by former insurance claims investigator Nate Ford, the inimitable Timothy Hutton. In the course of the con, these very separate and very eccentric people start to learn to work together to accomplish a goal other than to fill their own pockets or fulfill their own needs. Those in the group who were not previously ""con"" artists per se get completely hooked on the game. People who have been victims of the greedy and powerful start to hear about Nate's team and come in search of justice. Despite several attempts at, and forced separations, the team also starts to get hooked on working with each other, and they get hooked on doing good. Ultimately, they are compelled to keep coming back for more.The writing is impeccable, obviously well researched, and some of the best on television today. Amidst a plethora of ridiculous and downright repulsive ""reality"" shows, Leverage is a real breath of fresh air. May it go on for many seasons to come. I will buy them all!

1260710,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B002BWP2JO,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[0, 0]","One could say that the wonderful TNT series, ""Leverage: The Complete Second Season"", is living proof that Art Imitates Life, or something to that effect...not only did some of the episodes eerily echo actual machinations of a few world-class criminals, but one of the series' leads, wonderful Gina Bellman (grifter 'Sophie Devereaux') discovered she was pregnant as the season's first episode was filmed, necessitating some ""Leverage""-worthy 'sleight-of-hand' tricks to hide her expanding silhouette, and an eventual substitution by sexy Jeri Ryan, for the season's final arc of episodes (with Gina limiting her appearances to insure a safe childbirth) Ryan, while quite good, is NO Bellman, and I'm looking forward to Gina's return to regular duty in Season Three!There were some exciting new developments, both in front of, and behind the camera, as a new 'home base' for the series was established, in Portland, Oregon (substituting for the ""Leverage"" team's home, in Boston, Massachusetts). Portland granted the production crew an amazing freedom to shoot wherever they chose, resulting in a 'look' more 'cinematic' than nearly any other television series. The characters 'grew', just as the locale did; Ford (Timothy Hutton) gets off of booze, but in a very self-destructive manner; Sophie realizes she's 'losing' herself to her cons, and searches for her own identity; Parker (Beth Riesgraf) continues to improve her very strange people skills; Hardison (Aldis Hodge) discovers he has no second-story criminal gifts; and more of the Moral Code of Eliot Spencer (Christian Kane) is revealed. And, of course, you can't have Ford at his best without major villains, so Mark Sheppard returns as ruthless Jim Sterling, as brilliant as our hero, but without a heart; and, in a VERY amusing episode, the evil version of the ""Leverage"" crew debuts, led by the fabulous Griffin Dunne. (I'm looking forward to seeing their return!) And, as with Season One, a Commentary by producers, director, and writers, is offered as a 'bonus' for every episode!The ""Leverage"" Season finale is both visually stunning and emotionally overwhelming, and ranks, in my opinion, as an 'Instant Classic' moment for TNT...and stick around, because the last disc also offers very funny and insightful interviews, outtakes, and gags by cast and crew!If you thought ""Leverage: The First Season"" was great, wait until you see Season Two!",5,"The Breakout Comedy/Drama Triumphs, Again!",1275091200,"05 29, 2010",2010,2408,"['One', 'could', 'say', 'wonderful', 'TNT', 'series', 'Leverage', 'Complete', 'Second', 'Season', 'living', 'proof', 'Art', 'Imitates', 'Life', 'something', 'effect', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'episodes', 'eerily', 'echo', 'actual', 'machinations', 'few', 'world-class', 'criminals', 'one', 'series', 'leads', 'wonderful', 'Gina', 'Bellman', 'grifter', 'Devereaux', 'discovered', 'was', 'pregnant', 'season', 'first', 'episode', 'was', 'filmed', 'necessitating', 'Leverage', '-worthy', ""'sleight-of-hand"", 'tricks', 'hide', 'expanding', 'silhouette', 'eventual', 'substitution', 'sexy', 'Jeri', 'Ryan', 'season', 'final', 'arc', 'episodes', 'Gina', 'limiting', 'appearances', 'insure', 'safe', 'childbirth', 'Ryan', 'quite', 'good', 'NO', 'Bellman', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'Gina', 'return', 'regular', 'duty', 'Season', 'Three', 'were', 'exciting', 'new', 'developments', 'front', 'camera', 'new', ""'home"", 'base', 'series', 'was', 'established', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'substituting', 'Leverage', 'team', 'home', 'Boston', 'Massachusetts', 'Portland', 'granted', 'production', 'crew', 'amazing', 'freedom', 'shoot', 'wherever', 'chose', 'resulting', ""'look"", 'more', ""'cinematic"", 'nearly', 'other', 'television', 'series', 'characters', 'just', 'locale', 'did', 'Ford', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'booze', 'very', 'self-destructive', 'manner', 'Sophie', ""'losing"", 'cons', 'searches', 'own', 'identity', 'Parker', 'Beth', 'Riesgraf', 'improve', 'very', 'strange', 'people', 'skills', 'Hardison', 'Aldis', 'Hodge', 'second-story', 'criminal', 'gifts', 'more', 'Moral', 'Code', 'Eliot', 'Spencer', 'Christian', 'Kane', 'revealed', 'course', 'ca', ""n't"", 'have', 'Ford', 'best', 'major', 'villains', 'so', 'Mark', 'Sheppard', 'ruthless', 'Jim', 'Sterling', 'as', 'brilliant', 'hero', 'heart', 'VERY', 'amusing', 'episode', 'evil', 'version', 'Leverage', 'crew', 'debuts', 'led', 'fabulous', 'Griffin', 'Dunne', ""'m"", 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'return', 'Season', 'One', 'Commentary', 'producers', 'director', 'writers', 'offered', ""'bonus"", 'episode', 'Leverage', 'Season', 'finale', 'visually', 'stunning', 'emotionally', 'overwhelming', 'ranks', 'opinion', ""'Instant"", 'Classic', 'moment', 'TNT', 'stick', 'around', 'last', 'disc', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'insightful', 'interviews', 'outtakes', 'gags', 'cast', 'crew', 'thought', 'Leverage', 'First', 'Season', 'was', 'great', 'wait', 'see', 'Season', 'Two']",Leverage: Season 2

1260713,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B002BWP2JO,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","""LEVERAGE"" is the hit TV drama series on TNT executive produced by Dean Devlin (""Godzilla"", ""Independence Day"" and ""Universal Soldier""), Chris Downey (""The King of Queens"") and John Rogers (""Cosby"") and also to see involvement by Jonathan Frakes (""Star Trek: The Next Generation"", ""Roswell"") as a director and Amy Berg (""The 4400') as a writer/producer.""LEVERAGE"" stars Academy Award winner Timothy Hutton (""The Good Shepherd"", ""Ordinary People"" and ""The Last Mimzy""), Christian Kane (""Angel"", ""Close to Home""), Aldis Hodge (""Red Sands"", ""Friday Night Lights""), Gina Bellman (""Coupling"", ""Jekyll"" and ""Permanent Vacation""), Beth Riesgraf (""Struck"") and Mark Sheppard (""Battlestar Galactica"" and ""Dollhouse"") who are part of a group of thieves who steal from the corrupt and give to the needy.For the first season, the series would become a major hit for TNT as it became the #1 program on Tuesday nights with solid ratings for the drama series.  As the series is now approaching its third season, the second season will be available on DVD featuring 15 episodes on 4-DVD's and plenty of special features!""LEVERAGE"" revolves around former Insurance Investigator Nate Ford (Timothy Hutton) who has exposed scams and recovered stolen items worth millions for his insurance company. But when it came to getting his son's medical treatment covered, his insurance company denied it and his son died because he was unable to get the treatment he needed.One day, someone gives Nate a chance to get back at his insurance company, if he teams up with a group of thieves and manages them. In the process, Nate realizes the good that this group can do (and at the same time fulfilling their needs for stealing and making money) and creates a company called Leverage Consulting & Associates which was created to help those with major insurance problems and give them leverage and making sure that what happened to him, will never happen to anyone else.For the second season, Nate and the Leverage team decide to reunite but this time around, the jobs they have are much more riskier including the group taking on a popular government official and not knowing that Nate's rival  James Sterling is back and now working for Interpol and is trying to capture Nate.""LEVERAGE - The 2nd Season"" features the following episodes on four discs:Disc 1:* EPISODE 14 - The Beantown Bailout - The Leverage team reunites to take on a major job that involves an Irish mob and a banker.* EPISODE 15 - The Tap-Out Job - Leverage goes to Nebraska to take on a corrupt mixed martial arts promoter.* EPISODE 16 - The Order 23 Job - The Leverage team tries to stage a virus breakout in order to retrieve money from a convicted felon who have stolen from the people.* EPISODE 17 - The Fairy Godparents Job - The Leverage team ends up at a private school in which Sophie tries to help a teenager in need.Disc 2:* EPISODE 18 - The Three Days of the Hunter Job - The Leverage team work to expose a tabloid newscaster.* EPISODE 19 - The Top Hat Job - The Leverage team must put on a magic show to take on a corporation putting out tainted food in the market.* EPISODE 20 - The Two Live Crew Job - The Leverage team takes on another group of thieves.* EPISODE 21 - The Ice Man Job - Since Sophie is gone, Hardison must play the inside man to take down a diamond merchant.DISC 3:* EPISODE 22 - The Lost Heir Job - The Leverage team tries to stop a crooked lawyer from trying to take over his client's estate.* EPISODE 23 - The Runway Job - The Leverage team infiltrates an oppressive sweatshop.* EPISODE 24 - The Bottle Job - The Leverage team takes on a loan shark.* EPISODE 25 - The Zanzibar Marketplace Job - The Leverage team must work with their enemy Sterling in order to free Maggie from jail.DISC 4:* EPISODE 26: The Future Job - The team goes after a fraud psychic medium (played by ""Beverly Hills 90210' star Luke Perry).* EPISODE 27: The Three Strikes Job - The Leverage team takes on their largest project yet, taking down a corrupt lawyer.* EPISODE 28: The Maltese Falcon Job - The season finale.  As the Leverage team tries to take down a corrupt lawyer and Sterling gives Nate an ultimatum which which will change the team dynamic.VIDEO:Overall, ""LEVERAGE"" looks very good for a television drama. Featured in Widescreen, a lot of scenes are done in the indoors and outdoors that is where the series is most vibrant and more colorful. Like most drama series on DVD, it's when you get into low light situations and you do see artifacting.  But I have to admit that ""Leverage"" has been one of those titles with very good video and personally, this is one series that I would have loved to see released on Blu-ray.  But overall, for a drama series on DVD, ""LEVERAGE"" is stylishly cool in terms of visual appeal.AUDIO:As for audio, the series is presented in Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround and definitely utilizes the front channels for its explosions and rear surrounds take advantage of action sequences. I discovered use of LFE as well and overall, for a drama series on DVD, ""LEVERAGE"" sounds great. Dialog is easy to understand and more than enough action sequences on each episode.SPECIAL FEATURES:""LEVERAGE"" features many special features as each disc has optional audio commentary for EVERY episode. The fourth disc is where the majority of the special features are located. Included on the fourth disc are:* The Creators of Leverage Q&A; - (18:55) Executive producers John Rogers, Dean Devlin and Chris Downey talk to a live audience about how the origins of the show came about and casting the talent for ""Leverage"".* John Rogers Set Tour - (3:08) Executive Producer John Rogers talks about shooting in Portland, Oregon and a tour of Leverage HQ.* Behind the Boom Featurette - (7:14) A featurette on the creation of special effects for ""Leverage"".  In this featurette, the creation of a major explosion in a building.* ""The Hand Job"" Spoof Video - (5:08) Actor Aldis Hodge shows people how to do things the Leverage way.* Andy Lange Music Featurette - (2:58) Singer/songwriter Andy Lange talks about utilizing his music on the show.  The producers talk about how they came about using Andy's music on the show.* Season 2 Wrap Party Gag Reel - (9:02) Featuring the bloopers from season 2 of ""Leverage"" plus the cast and crew of ""Leverage"" doing gags on set.EXTRAS:""Leverage - The 2nd Season"" comes with a cardboard slip-over case.JUDGMENT CALL:From the first episode of ""Leverage"", I was sold.  Solid writing, cool characters and overall, the first season was exciting and enjoyable.  The second season turns up the notch as we see more action and also the odds against the team slightly higher.  The characters are truly tested and by the end of the final season, it definitely makes you excited (as well as a bit impatient) for the upcoming third season.I was very impressed with the first season and each talent really brings their A game to the series. Timothy Hutton plays a convincing role as the mastermind of the group; Gina Bellman brings that sexiness that she had in BBC's ""Coupling"" to the series but added depth as a true-to-art con artist; It's great to see Christian Kane again kicking butt since his years on ""Angel"" and also to see the two talents Beth Riesgraf and Aldis Hodge definitely shine in this series. The characters are well, cast, well-planned, well integrated into the series and I really enjoyed the amount of character development we see in each episode. Despite being thieves, they are all likable in their own way.If anything, we are starting to see the chemistry of each characters gel and also, I like how things are starting to heat up between Nate and Sophie.  As for the addition of Jeri Ryan to the second season of ""Leverage"", she's a bit of a wildcard.  You can picture her helping the team but at the same time, but unlike the other members, she's been used to the con life for awhile and she can play both sides and thus, it'll be interesting to see how her character is utilized in the future.I also felt the writers bringing back Mark Sheppard for Jim Sterling was smart.  He is the true antagonist for the group and how the ended the second season definitely will have viewers wanting to know what happens for the third season.Usually, there tends to be some drop-off when it comes to storytelling but the writers managed to keep things exciting and fresh, now that we are seeing the group becoming more mobile as they take on various jobs nationwide.  But this time, the jobs they are taking on are much riskier and can lead to their downfall.For those who haven't watched the first season, it helps to know the background and why Nate is driven to work with a group of thieves but the series is easy to follow, so it's not going to be hard to follow the storyline for season two.  But I do recommend watching the first because it goes into the team dynamics and also learning about Nate's drive for what he is doing.As for the DVD, similar to the last season's release, it's packed with special features and commentary.  I think that fans of the show will be entertained by the amount of content included.  The commentary tracks are actually informative and there are a good amount of humor in the commentary tracks, in fact, no worries about the commentary being dry as they keep the commentary tracks quite lively.Overall, ""Leverage"" fans will enjoy this latest DVD release.  Fifteen exciting and enjoyable episodes, plenty of special features content and like the first release, ""Leverage - The 2nd Season"" is quite solid and I doubt anyone will be disappointed.  Definitely recommended!",5,"Exciting, fun and highly enjoyable!  Another thrilling, action-packed second season of ""Leverage""!",1276646400,"06 16, 2010",2010,9619,"['LEVERAGE', 'hit', 'TV', 'drama', 'series', 'TNT', 'executive', 'produced', 'Dean', 'Devlin',

1260719,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B002BWP2JO,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 1]","Our crooks, catching up after six months of apartness:- Parker: ""I stole the Hope Diamond, and then I put it back.""- Hardison: ""I spent three days hacking the White House email.... No buzz, but we are doing some pretty hinky stuff in Pakistan. Hiiiinky.""- Sophie: ""Look, I'm miserable. They're miserable."" (looks at Eliot) ""Okay, what have you been doing the last six months?""- Eliot: ""I was in Pakistan.""With LEVERAGE and WHITE COLLAR doing pretty well on cable TV, it's safe to say that the Nielsens and we just plain love our fast-talking anti-heroes, just plain relish the art of the con. We should've known that last season's demolition of their headquarters wouldn't be enough to thwart our well-meaning, not-quite-reformed bunch of scoundrels from exerting their brand of ""leverage"" on them what deserves it. LEVERAGE's second season opens up with Nathan Ford's crew disassembled now for six months and scattered to the winds. Nate Ford himself has given up the liquor, although he's still mighty tempted. But a chance reunion and a case of a victimized father and daughter motivate the gang for one last con. Except we know it's not really the last con.Nathan Ford's new base of operations is now in Boston, and maybe it's a bit ironic that his loft apartment/headquarters sits over an Irish bar, and that this bar is where Nathan tends to screen potential clients (this doesn't seem too smart to me but whatever). As ever Nathan, a recovering lush and still very much broken, gets the lion's share in character development, with the show taking its sweet time in disclosing backstories on his crew. We already know that Parker is the quirky thief and a social mine field, that Eliot is the strong and silent muscle, and that Hardison is the gabby computer tech. For the most part, that's still all we know about them; they continue to be, er, sketchy characters. Sophie Deveraux, sometime horrendous actress, sometime grifter, fares better, is written with added layers. But the potential romance between her and Nate is put on hold (matter of fact, the potential romance between Parker and Hardison is also fairly nonexistent now). Season 2 can be split into two halves: with Sophie and then without.SPOILER alert for the next two paragraphs (although by now I think everyone knows about the following):During her six months away from the Leverage team, Sophie had gotten herself a boyfriend, and this somehow leads to her raising angsty questions regarding her true self, blah blah blah. And then real life intrudes when Gina Bellman - the actress who plays Sophie - gets preggers and has to go on a pseudo-sabbatical. Her leavetaking is written in the show as Sophie taking a leave of absence to go ""find herself."" Off they go - Gina and Sophie - and this paves the way for Jeri Ryan.Sophie, not wanting to leave her team in the lurch, introduces Tara Cole (Ryan), her friend and fellow scam artist. But Sophie's departure has fragmented the team. And, being new on the block and unproven, Tara only widens the divide. Sophie's always provided the emotional grounding for the team, and with her gone Nate, who so far had kept his s#i+ together, begins to show cracks. In these episodes Sophie's screen time is reduced to brief consultations on the phone as her teammates hit her up for advice. Each call to Sophie pretty much ends with ""Don't tell Nate I called."" Except that even Nate calls.End SPOILERS.There's always a lost soul in need of championing. Crooked corporations continue to merit the harsh application of Nate's leverage. Rotten bad guys still make the most gratifying marks. LEVERAGE keeps on being incredibly addictive. The twisty elaborate stings, from the planning stages to the execution, are sharply written. The show is wicked funny, the humor consistently inspired by the clashing character dynamics. And then there's that prevailing sense of cool. All these elements make for satisfying television. This season's more showy and fun episodes find our lovable rogues putting on a magic show (""The Top Hat Job""), planting a pandemic scare on a convicted felon (""The Order 23 Job""), bamboozling charlatan psychic Luke Perry (""The Future Job""), and even taking on a rival pack of grifters (""The Two Live Crew Job""). Season 2 culminates with a highly charged two-parter as the crew works to bring down a corrupt mayor. One fallout is that Eliot gets hooked playing professional baseball. And then Ford's old nemesis, smug insurance investigator James Sterling, resurfaces to make life miserable for everyone. Prep yourself for yet another of them surprising season finales.The fifteen episodes comprising LEVERAGE Season 2 come in a 4-disc DVD set and has the following special features: The Creators of LEVERAGE in a Q & A at a special Los Angeles screening  of the Season 2 premiere (00:18:55 minutes); Co-creator/producer John Rogers gives a tour of the show's new sets (00:03:08); Behind the Boom featurette - the special effects behind two explosive scenes, including the Leverage headquarters getting blown up from Season One (00:07:14); ""The Hand Job"" spoof video - Aldis Hodges (""Hardison"") dispenses with some tips on how to hustle people (00:05:08); singer/songwriter/sound mixer Andy Lange's song ""Not Sure Yet"" is featured (00:02:58); the Season 2 Wrap Party Gag Reel (00:09:02); and informative audio commentaries by the creative team on each episode.LEVERAGE, along with WHITE COLLAR and BURN NOTICE, are three of the coolest, strongest shows currently going on cable, each show featuring some very shady characters. But as one victimized young soul notes in ""The Beantown Bailout"": ""There are wolves in the world, but sometimes they're the good guys, I guess."" I'm so glad that LEVERAGE has been renewed. As Nate Ford might say, ""Let's go steal a third season.""",5,"""Get back on the bike... the bike of crime.""",1275177600,"05 30, 2010",2010,5806,"['crooks', 'catching', 'up', 'six', 'months',

Nathan Ford and gang are back, giving overlooked and disadvantaged people a reason to hope as they take down very corrupt businesspeople, proffessional cons, and even old enemies.This time, there's much more feeling to each adventure, especially the episodes where Sophie isn't around and is replaced by a dear friend of hers. The gang felt like I did, wanting Sophie back, and when they try to get int touch with her, things can get very emotional.

1260738,AOCVPRFNS2IKN,B002BWP2JO,Lover of English,"[0, 1]","I just received the second season DVD of Leverage and after watching all the episodes I started watching again, with commentary.  This was a big mistake.  There are two or three points I want to address.  First, the commentators seemed to be under the mistaken impression that they were in a fraternity locker room where it's cool to swear.  These are allegedly adults.  They should have outgrown this childishness long ago.  I don't care what they do in private but when they are addressing the public they should have more courtesy. Second, they spent so much time yapping about Portland (""This was the X building in Portland"" and ""We shot this in Y spot in Portland"" and ""Portland was so good to us"" and ""These were local actors who adopted a Boston accent"")that it is now impossible to imagine that the Leverage team is in Boston. Why didn't they just set the thing in Portland? Also, I don't want the magic taken away, which means I don't want to hear about every little detail about special effects and when a stunt double is being used.The level of commentary is mediocre.  I just watched two movies that had good quality commentary: ""Seven Days in May"" with John Frankenheimer commenting and ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" where one of the commentators mentioned the difference between older movies that had to rely on various levels of talent, compared to movies of today that rely on technology.  That talent is in short supply is often apparent when a commentator remarks on how amazing it is that an actor can move from one emotional level to another.  That's what they do, folks.  They're actors.That said, I want to comment on the third season.  Wow!  They have some inspired writing this year.  Season Three is sizzling.  There is particularly good character development this season with all kinds of hidden talent surfacing, especially with regard to Parker, Hardison and Elliott.  The plots are interesting and varied. There's some writing talent here; they don't seem to feel the need for the inevitable car chase or explosions with cars cartwheeling all over the set.  They are relying on the characters to tell the story.

Gina spent most of season two preparing for the birth of her daughter, and the series creators brought in Jeri Ryan to cover for her...not ""replace"" her. She's seen in countless ""on the phone"" segments to remind you that she's away, but not ""gone."" That gives Hutton plenty of opportunities to bounce back and forth between ""giving her space"" and asking her to ""come home.""This gave Aldis Hodge the opportunity to shine in ""The Ice Man Job,"" because the team ""needed a grifter,"" and with Sophie absent, Hardison stepped in. Of course, he's not a grifter by nature, so his masquerade leads to his being captured by the Russian mob. The series creators also take full advantage of this, using Christian Kane's ""Eliot"" character to rib Hardison over this in a later episode. The cast really excels at the ""sibling rivalry"" discord...they can come together to pull off a ""job,"" but they can also squabble like kids who have had too much sugar. The series creators wisely keep this in check and never go overboard with it. In small doses, it's fun. Overdone and ""Leverage"" would become ""Three's Company"" in a heartbeat.Beth Riesgraf as ""Parker"" shines here, especially in the ""Ice Man Job"" episode (""No stabbing, Parker!""). She's smart enough to pull off major heists but is conflicted in every way imaginable when it comes to dealing with others on a ""normal"" basis...case in point the first Season 2 episode, where Hutton wakes up to find her eating cereal in a nun's outfit. She's gorgeous and crazy and brings an ongoing sense of oddball charm to what is already a somewhat oddball cast and concept.Timothy Hutton definitely sinks his teeth into the multiple characters he plays...some ridiculously eccentric (like Dr. Melcher and his ""Melcher Method""). Others are more ""normal,"" but the undercurrent of the Ford character is that you have a recovering alcoholic whose life is still a mess in many ways (including the ""is this a relationship"" relationship with Sophie). He manages to pull together a team of criminals to do one Robin Hood good deed after the other, and there are times when the Ford character...even in moments of success...seems empty inside. He will occasionally order a drink (his condo, the ""team clubhouse,"" sits over a bar) and walk away without taking a sip. Sherlock Holmes had cocaine, Nathan Ford has alcohol. Every genius has his or her demons.This series is head and shoulders above the normal ""cable TV drama"" in every way.

It was fast, and fun, if a little silly. The characters were well thought out and extremely enjoyable, as were their interactions with each other. I came into the second season expecting something like the first except more polished. I was shocked to see that it was just the opposite.Where the last season was just barely believable, this one was way over the top with the kind of stunts they pulled to get the bad guys in the end. Fake virus outbreaks, horrible magic shows, and conspiracy theories are only some of the misteps that this season took. The thrill of this show was seeing how these modern day robin hoods worked was seeing their high tech gadgets, and expertise in using them. Dressing up in unfunny costumes to achieve their goals was the preferred course of action far too often. The worst offender was Timothy Hutton as Nate Ford. When Tim is playing Nate as Nate, he is brilliant. He can be tortured, charming, funny, and underhanded all at the same time. When he dons one of his numerous costumes however his performance is actually painful to watch. Why they insist on Nate playing dress up is beyond me.The rest of the cast however, are able to shift in and out of disguise almost flawlessly.I know this is sounding like I hate this season, but the fact is that a handful of episodes are so good that I bought it anyway, knowing that they were in the minority. In: ""The two live crew Job"" the team goes up against a crew of their on dopplegangers( also Will Wheaton gives a great performance in this one), ""The Ice Man job"" has the team helping Hardison out of a very funny jam of his own creation, ""The bottle job"" sees Nate push himself and the Team to the limits with how quickly they can con a loan shark out of their neighborhood. The best episodes in the season has to be nearly flawless two part season finale. I won't give anything away, but the ending is quite satisfying.All in all, if you aren't a die hard Leverage fan I would rent, or download certain episodes from this very mediocre season.",3,Unfortunately unbalanced,1275523200,"06 3, 2010",2010,2134,"['first', 'season', 'Leverage', 'was', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'shows', 'had', 'started', 'stagnate', 'was', 'fast', 'fun', 'little', 'silly', 'characters', 'were', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'extremely', 'enjoyable', 'were', 'interactions', 'other', 'came', 'second', 'season', 'expecting', 'something', 'first', 'more', 'polished', 'was', 'shocked', 'see', 'was', 'just', 'opposite.Where', 'last', 'season', 'was', 'just', 'barely', 'believable', 'one', 'was', 'way', 'top', 'kind', 'stunts', 'pulled', 'get', 'bad', 'guys', 'end', 'Fake', 'virus', 'outbreaks', 'horrible', 'magic', 'shows', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'are', 'only', 'misteps', 'season', 'took', 'thrill', 'show', 'was', 'seeing', 'how', 'modern', 'day', 'robin', 'hoods', 'worked', 'was', 'seeing', 'high', 'tech', 'gadgets', 'expertise', 'using', 'Dressing', 'up', 'unfunny', 'costumes', 'achieve', 'goals', 'was', 'preferred', 'course', 'action', 'far', 'too', 'often', 'worst', 'offender', 'was', 'Timothy', 'Hutton', 'Nate', 'Ford', 'When', 'Tim', 'playing', 'Nate', 'Nate', 'brilliant', 'can', 'be', 'tortured', 'charming', 'funny', 'underhanded', 'same', 'time', 'When', 'one', 'numerous', 'costumes', 'however', 'performance', 'actually', 'painful', 'watch', 'Why', 'insist', 'Nate', 'playing', 'dress', 'up', 'me.The', 'rest', 'cast', 'however', 'are', 'able', 'shift', 'disguise', 'almost', 'flawlessly.I', 'know', 'sounding', 'hate', 'season', 'fact', 'handful', 'episodes', 'are', 'so', 'good', 'bought', 'anyway', 'knowing', 'were', 'minority', 'two', 'live', 'crew', 'Job', 'team', 'up', 'crew', 'dopplegangers', 'also', 'Will', 'Wheaton', 'great', 'performance', 'one', 'Ice', 'Man', 'job', 'team', 'helping', 'Hardison', 'very', 'funny', 'jam', 'own', 'creation', 'bottle', 'job', 'sees', 'Nate', 'push', 'Team', 'limits', 'how', 'quickly', 'can', 'con', 'loan', 'shark', 'neighborhood', 'best', 'episodes', 'season', 'be', 'nearly', 'flawless', 'two', 'part', 'season', 'finale', 'wo', ""n't"", 'give', 'anything', 'away', 'ending', 'quite', 'satisfying.All', 'are', ""n't"", 'die', 'hard', 'Leverage', 'fan', 'would', 'rent', 'download', 'certain', 'episodes', 'very', 'mediocre', 'season']",Leverage: Season 2

Each week the team gets to play a different character which I would assume would be an actors dream. I love the show and wish it would have been renewed.

Addition of new character removed the entire essence of Leverage and I have nothing good to say about this season.  I noticed she didn't remain which lead me to believe the writers were on the same page.  New person and character portrayed would probably be good on another show but not this one.  I don't remember her name but have seen her on other shows; somehow she didn't add to those either. Maybe she'll find her place.",1,Failure of Season 2,1385856000,"12 1, 2013",2013,486,"['Season', '2', 'was', 'complete', 'waste', 'time', 'money', 'effort', 'Addition', 'new', 'character', 'removed', 'entire', 'essence', 'Leverage', 'have', 'nothing', 'good', 'say', 'season', 'noticed', 'did', ""n't"", 'remain', 'lead', 'believe', 'writers', 'were', 'same', 'page', 'New', 'person', 'character', 'portrayed', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'good', 'show', 'not', 'one', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'name', 'have', 'seen', 'other', 'shows', 'somehow', 'did', ""n't"", 'add', 'Maybe', ""'ll"", 'find', 'place']",Leverage: Season 2
