821964,AY69ZK7G6CNYJ,B00022PZ2Y,"Britt Gillette ""thedvdreport.blogspot.com""","[1, 2]","Anyone who's seen the Blue Collar Comedy Tour knows Ron White well. Blessed with a deep Southern accent (I'm from the South too), White dominates the stage with a rare charisma only few comedians achieve. With a glass of liquor in hand and curling puffs of cigarette smoke emanating from his mouth, Ron White delivers line after line of creative wit that's his and his alone...So yesterday, I was sittin' in a beanbag chair naked eatin' Cheetos, and I decided to pop in this Ron White DVD, and could you believe it? He was talking about sittin' in a beanbag chair naked eating Cheetos... It's like he KNOWS me!Any fan of White and his Blue Collar Comedy Tour friends is quite familiar with the beanbag chair and the Cheetos, and Ron White's They Call Me Tater Salad is no disappointment. The DVD rehashes some of the more popular parts of his Blue Collar routine, while simultaneously delving into new areas of study. Viewers will quickly learn the difference between a pair of $300 sunglasses and a ""$200 TV that decodes digital signals from outer F-$%@! Space!"" Because there is a difference after all. One blocks 100% of all UV rays and also gets basic cable. The other can be purchased at Wal-Mart... With White's comedy career taking off, you'll also find out that if he had known the difference between anecdote and antidote as a kid, then his friend Bob Snyder would still be alive...If you haven't seen the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, then I highly recommend it. It's one of the best comedy DVDs in years. Ron White is a good reason why. Perfect in his delivery and showcasing a instinctive knowledge of perfect timing for a remark, he makes a name for himself with this one.

Some people complain that THEY CALL ME TATER SALAD is essentially a rehash of his BLUE COLLAR material, but I say so what?  In a world of ho-hum stand-ups, Ron White is the real thing.  He is screamingly funny from start to finish.The show is simple enough, about an hour long on a bare stage.  A stool holds a bowl of ice, water, and ashtray; Ron keeps a cigarette going and when his glass runs empty he whips out a flask.  Along the way we learn about his wife whose parents are so rich that she never learned to do anything for herself, his thoughts on capital punishment, Sears auto repair, strip clubs, homophobes, and the sexual needs of his bulldog Sluggo.  It's raunchy, vulgar, and very, very funny.  The DVD includes several extras that prolong the good time a bit more.My one complaint about the thing is technical: there are moments when the sound is a bit uneven.  You would think they would have fixed this when they did the sound mix, but apparently not--and in truth it scarcely matters.  Just turn the sound up.

""Right to the crash site""); dealing with his ex and her snobby upper-crust family; musing over a pair of overpriced sunglasses, California liberals, and jewelry advertising (""Diamonds...that'll shut her up""); his hatred of Sears mechanics who missed ""lug nut day""; and of course the origins of his alias and being ""drunk in public"" (""I was THROWN out of a bar.."").
