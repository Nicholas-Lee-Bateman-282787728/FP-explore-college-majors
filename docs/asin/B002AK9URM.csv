While it is not a great movie, there is something at once disturbing and beautiful about it.  The setting is extremely effective--the beach looks so civilized and domestic:  there are roads and paths, and at first there is less of a sense of wilderness than one might expect.  As the oddness and the sense of wrongness slowly build, the contrast is striking.  The choice of the dugong as a motif was inspired--it looked completely inert and completely threatening at the same time.

There were some truly unexpected twists and that's what true movie lovers desire..right? There were a couple of mistakes in this movie but not enough to hurt a great time on a Wednesday afternoon with nothing to do. The tension between the young couple connected well with the unfamiliar Australian coastline wild. This is a scary movie for a lot of reasons you don't normally see in a woodsy thriller. The ending was scary as heck and makes you think about camping in the wilderness without full knowledge of not only where you are but what's watching you and what can harm you.

Although his acting was superb as always, I was extremely disappointed in his role in this movie.  I'm not sure this movie is up to being even a ""B"" movie - and he is a more talented actor than that.  That said, I was not prepared for the attacking birds, creepy spiders, and (OMG what I hate to see the most!) SNAKES!  Much of the movie is extremely dark, and I found myself saying why didn't they wait until daylight so they could see where they were going?  So EVEN I COULD SEE where they were going?  I did not anticipate all of the obscenities that were in the movie, and I know he is just acting, but, like another viewer noted, I did not expect this language from soft spoken Jim of 'Person of Interest' fame.  For the record, the fine print on the dust cover reads ""R"" for ""language, some disturbing violent images, and brief sexual material.""  I guess it was the ""disturbing violent images"" and the snakes that really did me in.  When Peter (Jim) peaks in a tent, I covered my eyes and asked my husband to tell me what was there.

The wife (Carla) wants to go to a hotel and the husband  (Peter) wants to go camping; they go camping. They are supposed to meet up with friends, but the friends never show up and we never find out why. The husband is immature and selfish and the wife is selfish and finds fault with everything; they make a great pair. On top of that, neither of them has any respect for nature at all so it's not easy to find anything to like about either one. Cricket, Peter's dog, is very easy to like. Then there's a dying sea cow, which is a scary animal on land and seems to be the reason the couple go crazy. There's also a gruesome scene of a family Peter discovers, but it wasn't clear how it tied into the rest of the movie unless it was about more death. The movie didn't flow well at all. Carla eventually gets fed up with Peter saying it's time to leave without actually leaving and then Cricket is missing, but Carla takes off anyway--this makes me dislike the Carla character even more. Eventually Peter finds Carla dead, but it's not clear why she's dead (I saw this on TV, so maybe they edited out a critical part), then he goes nuts, goes crashing through the woods, and finds a road but gets splattered by a big truck. I suppose we're meant to be horrified by how Peter's and Carla's lives ended, but all I could think at the end of the movie was, ""Where is Cricket? Did Peter leave her in the car? Can she get out? If not, will  someone find her? I want to see a happy ending for Cricket."" But, sadly, we never find out what happened to Cricket. Very strange movie.

1258230,A20NJAPECFGIR9,B002AK9URM,"nina ""Movie Maiden""","[4, 5]","I wouldn't have even gotten through this movie. It's not that I am some big Caviezel fan but this film was just so weird. It wasn't exactly bad but it's not stunning mystery and certainly no horror like it's been described. It's a subtle-type mystery but unfortunately the suspense is too subtle.I felt the movie was best when it focused on the couple's troubled marriage. I found that more compelling than the so-called scary element. It was as if the scary thing was just thrown in. The movie was on about an hour before anything weird started happening so you didn't really need that element at all. I think the film would've been good as just a film about a couple getting away to work out their problems.The acting was very good and is what kept me watching, especially Jim Caviezel. His excitement for the beach makes you want to stay there with him just to see what adventures he finds each day. But as you watch you begin to feel like the wife where you just wanna leave because nothing's happening. In the film she says, ""I'm bored!"" It's then that I began to feel the exact same way about the film. It just seemed to move so quick in the beginning and stalled when they got to the beach. After so many scenes of watching Peter surf and curse out his wife, you get bored with it.There wasn't enough action or any action for this to be a suspense. Stuff should have started happening way in the beginning of the movie. It's like the writers tried to be too clever and play tricks with your mind but it fell short. It only ended up being repetitive and the few scary things that did happen weren't scary at all.Jim saves the day for this film. If he hadn't played his character with such excitement I would've turned it off. Peter (Caviezel) slowly begins to be sucked in by the beach and just as I became fascinated about that fact, thinking he would show some mental instability because of that obsession, it all went nowhere. It would've been great to see Peter so crazed that he lost sense of everything and then you could understand the beach's hold on him.

The story reminded me of the classic ""Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner,"" a morality tale about the consequences of not respecting life. In the old story, sailors wantonly kill a sea bird and bring down the wrath of nature upon the rest of their voyage. In this version, this morally corrupt couple wrecks their marriage through adultery and an abortion. This crime against nature is the heart of the plot although not revealed until nearly the end. They go off on a beach holiday to restore their relationship but it only brings out more of their selfish natures and they continue to desecrate the living things around them, bringing down Nature's wrath until both get what they deserve in the end.I was surprised at the coarse language on the part of the players, esp. Mr. Caviezel. Yes, it's true to the character but shocking nonetheless considering his religious assertions. He refuses to do sex scenes but apparently doesn't draw the line at profanity.

Guess there has to be a miss sooner or later - this would be the miss.The story follows an unhappily married couple as they venture to a secluded northern Australia beach to camp and relax. They also bring a dog (relevant to the atrocious writing at the end). Whilst they camp and plod around, they talk, do stupid things to nature, argue and become fearful of the animals surrounding them. That about sums it up. The writing was hilarious at times, even though this is a suspense movie. For instance, our guy becomes upset because his lady trashes an eagle egg, but it was ok for him to execute a sea lion the scene before, whatever. There is also this plague of bad lighting throughout the entire film during each night shot.The scenery is beautiful, and the film stock was good. The sound is average and the DVD is bare bones with some bizarre cover art. One last little gripe, when you select the Play option from the menu, that should not include making you watch the trailers before the film starts.

I mean, he's played Jesus, and I just watched the ""Thin Red Line"" where he...plays Jesus, sort of, and now I just can't imagine how this was pitched to him as a good idea.Other reviews have covered the plot elements adequately, but I must shine a light on the overall vileness of the two main characters.  Constant, vicious, arguing.  I realize this was part of the story, but there you have it - I don't enjoy nasty arguing between couples for two hours straight.  Within 15 minutes I was pointing out to the Significant Other (who spent the whole movie being productive on the computer and leaving me to agonize alone) that I simply couldn't wait for one of them to be killed, just so I wouldn't have to listen to them any more.""Look,"" I say, ""Jim Caviezel is playing a jerk for the first time!""""Look,"" I say, ""That beach is really pretty.""""Look,"" I say, ""They called that thing a Sea Cow.

It's got a weird name, but it's not quite a manatee....""And then they reveal it as a dugong (which I mistakenly thought was spelled, ""dewgong,"" but that's a Pokemon, and this is a manatee-relative.  A dugong?  And then there's a snake, and a bush-baby-type thing, but a dugong?  Who names these creatures?  At least the dugong made another appearance (and a startling one at that) later in the movie, so they got their money's worth out of that big plastic model.But, the answer to my whining query?  I see it now, as the bare-chested Caviezel wanders up and down the coastline, looking tanned and fit.  They sold him on the movie by showing him pictures of the beach.
