IN FACT, a dear friend of mine was talking about Mother Love and remembering Diana Rigg's wonderfully chilling performance.  I want a copy for me, but I really want to get him a copy. If you ever saw I Claudius and shuddered at Livila's knack for poisoning people's bodies, you will enjoy Mother Love. If you marveled at Nancy Marchand's noteworthy performance in the first season of the Sopranos as Toni's mother, you will enjoy Mother Love. What showers were to Psycho, marzipan is to Mother Love. It is an interesting thriller and psychological profile.  The rest of the cast and the whole production is worthy of Rigg's main character.  The world deserves to get goosebumps from watching this miniseries from BBC or Thames or whoever made this happen.",5,WHEN?

I had the good fortune to spot her when my high school English class went to see the Royal Shakespeare on tour at the National Theater in Washington, DC, in 1964. She appeared there in Comedy of Errors. What a versatile actress! IMO she never got quite her due as a dramatic actress. Fans of Avenger will be shocked at the terrifying character she portrays in Mother Love. She revives memories of Gene Tierney in her Oscar-nominated performance in Leave Her to Heaven, a similarly absorbing tale of obsession truly run amok. Coincidentally Mother Love reminded me how much I missed David McCallum once Man from U.N.C.L.E. disappeared beneath the waves. He admirably portrays Rigg's ex-husband, an intellectual musician incapable of fathoming the depths of Rigg's depravity. Like the other reviewer, I have been waiting for this movie to be released for years.

1051294,A2WJCE8VF3STFW,B000MV8H3Y,Judith,"[4, 4]","This mini series is still rebroadcast in the UK, so I was able to obtain a DVD recorded off TV there.  It's strange that it has not been released on DVD here or in the UK.  I see that one of the local PBS stations is rebroadcasting older programs from Mystery.  I hope they will show Mother Love, and create demand for the DVD.  Really everything from Masterpiece Theater and Mystery should be released on DVD, especially Mother Love and By the Sword Divided.I've been watching my DVD over and over since I got it a few weeks ago, and I just love it.  Now I am reading the book, which I bought used through amazon.  The book is also terrific.  It fills in details that, of course, they didn't have time to include in the miniseries.This is the story of how obsessive mother Helena disrupts the lives of her son, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, ex-husband and his new family, as they all participate in a grand conspiracy to hide that the son has regular contact with his father.  They think she is suicidal. What they don't know is that Helena is more likely to murder.  She has killed before and will kill again.Diana Rigg has the juicy part of Helena, which she plays to perfection.  The other actors play their roles perfectly.  James Wilby is excellent as Kit, the son who is torn between protecting his fragile (he thinks) mother and being honest with his little girls.  Isla Blair as Kit's stepmother is memorable and likeable.  Even the little girls playing Kit's daughters are good little actresses.  I'm thinking of the scene where ""Lollipop"" indignantly telss Grandma Helena that bratty Olivia, ""pushed Mary down the stairs on PURPOSE!""Watching this movie makes me speculate about questions.  What if Kit stood up to his mother?  Why didn't Alex try to get custody of Kit when he was a child?  Why would Alex and Ruth go along with the conspiracy to protect Helena?  Did Helena have a plan to hide her guilt in the last murder that failed, sort of?  Would Kit really have turned out so normal with a mother like that?
