1672682,AWMLV7I2E49RM,B00FQY4C86,Adam B.,"[0, 0]","The American Horror Story series is known for having a single season story arc, with much of the story defined by the setting where it takes place as much as by the characters in the show.  The actors in the show take on different roles with each new season and which actors are the focus, or even presence, changes as well.For this season, Angela Basset and Kathy Bates make an appearance in a story set in New Orleans and centered around a coven of witches and the school to train the younger witches.  The background mythos is that the coven is descended, for the most part, from the original Salem witches who scattered after the trials and attempted to blend into society while maintaining power in the background.  More importantly, over the years the strength and numbers of the coven have been dwindling as the power of the witches has weakened over time.The story unfolds as the head of the coven, portrayed by Jessica Lange, comes back into New Orleans to reassert her leadership while spending years away, enjoying her power, but shirking her responsibilities.  Her daughter, portrayed by Sarah Paulson, has been running the school, and in many ways the coven, for years in her stead.  From there, the show explores the growth in power of the younger witches, the desperate clinging to power of the older witches, and a power struggle with Angela Bassett's neighboring voodoo magic.As with all of the seasons, the story shows flashbacks in &#34;history&#34;, while mostly staying in the present and includes top flight writing and acting with an often graphic depiction of both violence and sex.  This season, especially, seems to be the finest yet, as the coven background provides an even stronger basis that allows the actors to explore their characters and the writers to introduce a wider variety of conflicts, mystery and magic.  Lange seems to revel in the stronger, more assertive character in this season, and the introduction of the talents of Bates and Bassett has strengthened the acting talent even further.  Given the focus on the female characters this season, most of the stronger male actors in past seasons aren't part of the mix, unfortunately.  The reintroduction of Taissa Farmiga, who was in the first season, works very well in a role that is well suited to her.  The other supporting actors and their characters has also been well done, with the depth of the writing showing as a large number of them have prominent roles that vary from week to week.Overall, I have really enjoyed the entire season, particularly watching the depth of the story as more and more of the mystery is filled in with each episode.  If the prior two seasons are any indication, the series will only get better towards the end as well.",5,Best season yet,1390867200,"01 28, 2014",2014,2746,"['American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'series', 'known', 'having', 'single', 'season', 'story', 'arc', 'much', 'story', 'defined', 'setting', 'where', 'place', 'as', 'much', 'characters', 'show', 'actors', 'show', 'take', 'different', 'roles', 'new', 'season', 'actors', 'are', 'focus', 'even', 'presence', 'changes', 'well.For', 'season', 'Angela', 'Basset', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'make', 'appearance', 'story', 'set', 'New', 'Orleans', 'centered', 'coven', 'witches', 'school', 'train', 'younger', 'witches', 'background', 'mythos', 'coven', 'descended', 'most', 'part', 'original', 'Salem', 'witches', 'who', 'scattered', 'trials', 'attempted', 'blend', 'society', 'maintaining', 'power', 'background', 'More', 'importantly', 'years', 'strength', 'numbers', 'coven', 'have', 'been', 'dwindling', 'power', 'witches', 'weakened', 'time.The', 'story', 'unfolds', 'head', 'coven', 'portrayed', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'back', 'New', 'Orleans', 'reassert', 'leadership', 'spending', 'years', 'away', 'enjoying', 'power', 'shirking', 'responsibilities', 'daughter', 'portrayed', 'Sarah', 'Paulson', 'been', 'running', 'school', 'many', 'ways', 'coven', 'years', 'stead', 'there', 'show', 'growth', 'power', 'younger', 'witches', 'desperate', 'clinging', 'power', 'older', 'witches', 'power', 'struggle', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'neighboring', 'voodoo', 'magic.As', 'seasons', 'story', 'flashbacks', '34', 'history', '34', 'mostly', 'staying', 'present', 'top', 'flight', 'writing', 'acting', 'often', 'graphic', 'depiction', 'violence', 'sex', 'season', 'especially', 'be', 'finest', 'yet', 'coven', 'background', 'even', 'stronger', 'basis', 'actors', 'explore', 'characters', 'writers', 'introduce', 'wider', 'variety', 'conflicts', 'mystery', 'magic', 'Lange', 'revel', 'stronger', 'more', 'assertive', 'character', 'season', 'introduction', 'talents', 'Bates', 'Bassett', 'strengthened', 'acting', 'talent', 'even', 'further', 'Given', 'focus', 'female', 'characters', 'season', 'most', 'stronger', 'male', 'actors', 'past', 'seasons', 'are', ""n't"", 'part', 'mix', 'unfortunately', 'reintroduction', 'Taissa', 'Farmiga', 'who', 'was', 'first', 'season', 'very', 'well', 'role', 'well', 'suited', 'other', 'supporting', 'actors', 'characters', 'also', 'been', 'well', 'done', 'depth', 'writing', 'showing', 'large', 'number', 'have', 'prominent', 'roles', 'vary', 'week', 'week.Overall', 'have', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'entire', 'season', 'particularly', 'watching', 'depth', 'story', 'more', 'more', 'mystery', 'filled', 'episode', 'prior', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'indication', 'series', 'will', 'only', 'get', 'better', 'towards', 'end', 'as', 'well']",American Horror Story: Coven

Since I watched the first two seasons on DVD, this was the first AHS season I watched on TV, and it was full of blood, horror, a great variety of very different characters that strangely bond together, and the addition of new actors was great. Emma, Gabourey, Angela and Kathy were spectacular with their roles, and the returning actors were awesome as usual.But the best about AHS is that you never know what's going to happen next, and this happens a LOT in this season. They are a lot of ""OMG"" moments, and I gotta admit I yelled at my TV with some stuff that happened. The plot moves really fast from one episode to the next one, and every episode is a good one! There's always something happening with all the characters. My favorite character from this season was Misty Day; Lily Rabe really proves that she can play anything! Of course, it lacks the horror of the previous seasons, but it compensates it with awesome performances and a good storyline. I can't wait to get it on DVD and watch the whole season again.

1672702,A24IZL1YQF0YBJ,B00FQY4C86,"Art Scott ""Statsmonster""","[0, 1]","Before anyone complains, remember, the first 2 seasons set the bar ridiculously high.  Both of them kept you near breathless and much like Walking Dead, were things you couldn't WAIT to see when they came out, many of us, myself included, even watching them through with commercials and all.  The first 2 seasons had a different kind of horror--certainly not the standard gory slasher flick (which, IMO, is the lowest form of film.  I'd rather watch one of &#34;the CW&#34;s many horrid bombs than watch a slasher film or TV show which depended upon gore for its viewers), but STILL managed to keep you white knuckling the covers.  This season completely lacked in horror of any form, IMO, perhaps OTHER than a few of the gory axe murderer scenes.  Instead it was situational horror which I found lacked the shows usual success of fearing what your favorite characters fear.  It's hard to be afraid of having your favorite character die when a Frankenstein-ish boy is put back together with parts from different characters which I found more disgusting than scary, especially when the Franken-boy was returned to his mother who sexually abused him.  And then, for me, the show didn't end properly.  The character which should have, by all the rules everyone had talked about throughout the season become the most powerful, didn't.Don't lose heart though.  You'll notice I DID give it 4 stars DESPITE all of that.  Kathy Bates' character was not only one of the most interesting, but also one of the most absolutely hysterically funny characters in the history of the series, even if some will find it in poor taste. It didn't matter to me, and shouldn't to most fans of the show.  Jessica Lange I felt was a bit mis-cast in this season because, c'mon, she's not the Jessica Lange of 40 years ago, and it's easy to see that, but the entire script save for the errors I mention above are wonderful, and it does give you that sensation of absolute triumph in the end.  The acting, as usual, was magnificent, with definite kudos going out to Bates, Taissa Farmiga, Angela Bassett, Sarah Paulson, and Emma Roberts.

Hard to watch, but the acting is so good, I must watch.  Storyline goes back in time a lot, threading the old into the new, past into the current.  Basic plotline is, 'if you were a witch, what would life be like for you amongst mere mortals?'The world loves witchcraft and devil, supernatural stories.  Spends oodles of money and time on them.  Some versions paint the witch/vamp/demon as a wanna-be good guy, dating back a long way, but most notably, to the charming 'Bewitched'.  Not here.  This is all about blood and vengeance, warring witch tribes and self-gratification, preservation.  Not for the light-hearted.  Not for sensitive viewers;  heck, I'm not sensitive but I find it hard to watch, too. Hence four stars, not five.

Protect the Coven12. Go To Hell13. The Seven WondersThe season began strong, the pilot of this season was endearingly good. By the next episode, things got messy fast. Too many flat characters with little to offer, Patti Lupone and Alexander Dreymon join the cast for a brief and forgetful family consisting of a bible humper and a personality-vacant son. Same is true for Bates' Delphine. From HBIC to maid, for most of the season her character was wasted.This season is not lacking in CAMPY dialogue and characters. Fiona and Cordelia are nowhere near as interesting as Sister Jude and Lana Winters. Frances' outrageously flamboyant character Myrtle is really only rattling on about bidets, fashion, amus bouche and her random thoughts.Lily Rabe returns with the most interesting character, Misty. Taissa and Evan join as two boring teens, Zoe and Kyle, who make a cringeworthy whiny couple. Evan's new character has no personality, or many lines. Denis O'Hare serves as the mute, oddball butler who likes tea parties with his dollies. Angela joins as a potent Marie Laveau; New Orleans' famous Voodoo Queen. Angela was a highlight, Marie was a force to be reckoned with.So many plots come and go, with no satisfactory tie up. The Witch Hunters, a promising plotline gets sour fast. Zombies, racism, resurrection, spells and such dry up fast. It becomes incredibly frustrating when characters are constantly revived. There's no suspense or twists. The premise that sticks is &#34;who is the next supreme?&#34; Which lots of viewers grew bored with, only to get a strange slap up ending.What could have been the best season yet became a campy, frothy mess. Murder House and Asylum prove Murphy and co. can kick ass. This season, there was too much promised (Kathy's Delphine and Jessica's Fiona were marketed as best friends turned worst enemies never happened. I specifically remember hearing Ryan saying at Paleyfest saying the two legends were going to go at it, hard.)Not to mention this season was perhaps the most gory, least thrilling, most perverse (My son is sexy, and I know it), but no shocks, just eye rolling.Rated TV-MA for strong gore and violence, aberrant sexual content, some language and mild drug content.",3,Third season lacks the HORROR of 'American Horror Story',1391126400,"01 31, 2014",2014,2933,"['chapter', '2', 'Asylum', 'was', 'anxiously', 'awaiting', 'Coven', 'A', 'secret', 'account', 'witches', 'America', 'involving', 'war', 'Salem', 'witches', 'Voodoo', 'practitioners', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'joining', 'historical', 'character', 'based', 'America', 'first', 'serial', 'killer', 'Madame', 'Marie', 'Delphine', 'LaLaurie', 'paper', 'perfection', 'execution', 'not', 'so', 'much.Starring', 'Jessica', 'LangeKathy', 'BatesAngela', 'BassettSarah', 'PaulsonTiassa', 'FarmingaEmma', 'RobertsGabourey', 'SidibeLily', 'RabeFrances', 'ConroyEvan', 'PetersDenis', ""O'Hareand"", 'Jamie', 'BrewerEpisodes-1', 'Bitchcraft2', 'Boy', 'Parts3', 'Replacements4', 'Fearful', 'Pranks', 'Ensue5', 'Burn', 'Witch', 'Burn', '6', 'Axeman', 'Cometh7', 'Dead8', 'Sacred', 'Taking9', 'Head10', 'Magical', 'Delights', 'Stevie', 'Nicks11', 'Protect', 'Coven12', 'Go', 'Hell13', 'Seven', 'WondersThe', 'season', 'began', 'strong', 'pilot', 'season', 'was', 'endearingly', 'good', 'next', 'episode', 'things', 'got', 'messy', 'fast', 'Too', 'many', 'flat', 'characters', 'little', 'offer', 'Patti', 'Lupone', 'Alexander', 'Dreymon', 'join', 'cast', 'brief', 'forgetful', 'family', 'consisting', 'bible', 'humper', 'personality-vacant', 'son', 'Same', 'true', 'Bates', 'Delphine', 'From', 'HBIC', 'maid', 'most', 'season', 'character', 'was', 'wasted.This', 'season', 'not', 'lacking', 'CAMPY', 'dialogue', 'characters', 'Fiona', 'Cordelia', 'are', 'nowhere', 'as', 'interesting', 'Sister', 'Jude', 'Lana', 'Winters', 'Frances', 'outrageously', 'flamboyant', 'character', 'Myrtle', 'really', 'only', 'rattling', 'bidets', 'fashion', 'amus', 'bouche', 'random', 'thoughts.Lily', 'Rabe', 'returns', 'most', 'interesting', 'character', 'Misty', 'Taissa', 'Evan', 'join', 'two', 'boring', 'teens', 'Zoe', 'Kyle', 'who', 'make', 'cringeworthy', 'whiny', 'couple', 'Evan', 'new', 'character', 'personality', 'many', 'lines', 'Denis', ""O'Hare"", 'mute', 'oddball', 'butler', 'who', 'tea', 'parties', 'dollies', 'Angela', 'potent', 'Marie', 'Laveau', 'New', 'Orleans', 'famous', 'Voodoo', 'Queen', 'Angela', 'was', 'highlight', 'Marie', 'was', 'force', 'be', 'reckoned', 'with.So', 'many', 'plots', 'come', 'go', 'satisfactory', 'up', 'Witch', 'Hunters', 'promising', 'plotline', 'sour', 'fast', 'Zombies', 'racism', 'resurrection', 'spells', 'such', 'dry', 'fast', 'incredibly', 'frustrating', 'when', 'characters', 'are', 'constantly', 'revived', 'suspense', 'twists', 'premise', 'sticks', '34', 'who', 'next', 'supreme', '34', 'Which', 'viewers', 'grew', 'bored', 'only', 'get', 'strange', 'slap', 'up', 'ending.What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'best', 'season', 'yet', 'became', 'campy', 'frothy', 'mess', 'Murder', 'House', 'Asylum', 'prove', 'Murphy', 'co.', 'can', 'kick', 'ass', 'season', 'was', 'too', 'much', 'promised', 'Kathy', 'Delphine', 'Jessica', 'Fiona', 'were', 'marketed', 'best', 'friends', 'turned', 'worst', 'enemies', 'never', 'happened', 'specifically', 'remember', 'hearing', 'Ryan', 'saying', 'Paleyfest', 'saying', 'two', 'legends', 'were', 'going', 'go', 'hard', 'Not', 'mention', 'season', 'was', 'perhaps', 'most', 'gory', 'least', 'thrilling', 'most', 'perverse', 'My', 'son', 'sexy', 'know', 'shocks', 'just', 'eye', 'rolling.Rated', 'TV-MA', 'strong', 'gore', 'violence', 'aberrant', 'sexual', 'content', 'language', 'mild', 'drug', 'content']",American Horror Story: Coven

1672733,A3DN9249F3X716,B00FQY4C86,Corey Lidster,"[2, 2]","American Horror Story was something very different when it debuted, and Season 1 succeeded in not only making an old-school horror tale work as a television series, it actually made a haunted house story that was creepy and utterly compelling. Both accomplishments were impressive. Other than the Walking Dead, when was the last time there's been a decent horror series that made it to season 2? And haunted houses... reside in the pop culture scrapyard. The fact they embraced the idea like they did, reinvigorating a tired sub-sub-genre with multi-generational narrative layering and out=of-left-field twists like the boy next door who turns out to be an undead school-shooter. Asylum was arguably even better, but far darker. Watching it I was continually amazed that the minds behind 'Glee' were responsible for the wonderfully twisted craziness that was unfolding: possessed nuns, a nazi doctor turning physically healthy patients into quadruple amputees and cannibalistic pigmen, a drunken mother superior with murder on her conscience. Sometimes the convoluted plot seemed close to going off the rails, but they managed to get it together. Coven might be the best of the three seasons; it's definitely the most accessible. Again, the writers take a subject that has pretty much flatlined in film and TV, and set out to make a series about witches that doesn't just not suck, doesn't just appeal to sulky tweenaged girls, but reinvents the way people think about witch stories, and make something great. Once again, they pull it off. Jessica Lange, like much of the cast, has returned each year playing a different character. As the 'Supreme' of the coven, which doubles as a posh girl's school in an old colonial mansion, she has been neglecting her duties, leaving everything in her daughters' hands as she seeks a way to fight off her encroaching death. Once again, she takes command of every scene she appears in; you'd have an easier time ignoring a hurricane... speaking of which, setting the tale in New Orleans was pretty much a necessity; no other city in America feels as old, hangs on to it's history, builds over and around it like the oldest cities in Europe.do. And New Orleans is also a place where Voodoo fluorished... In her desperate scramble to prolong her life, 'Supreme' Fiona Good seeks out the power possessed by her nemesis, Voodoo priestess Marie Laveaux, played by the ridiculously talented Angela Basset. Laveaux has been alive a long, long time, thanks to her god/devil Papa Guedhe. Her past goes back far enough to vividly recall a slave revolt against a murderous plantation owner played wonderfully by Kathy Bates. Not long after arriving with her three grown daughters, she discovers that torturing and killing slaves, then soaking in their blood, Elizabeth Bathory-style, is a great way to pass the time. Her sick games are ended when the young Laveaux condemns her to eternal life -- spent in a box buried deep in the earth. Until the present day, when Fiona digs her up, hoping to use this psychotic woman-out-of-time as leverage in enlisting Laveaux's aid. Meanwhile, the young witches in the coven have problems of their own. A self-centred teenage celebrity with powers that may rival Fiona's, a severely overweight black girl who can turn herself into a living voodoo doll, the new girl who accidentally kills every boy she sleeps with, the enigmatic swamp witch, a Stevie Nicks obsessed hermit with powers of resurrection... all the ingredients are added to the brew, and eventually it's set to explode. The violent twists and turns are fairly unpredictable, and while it's not as nasty as Asylum, it's got zombies getting hacked to pieces with a chainsaw, numerous dismemberments and beheadings, tongues are taken off using scissors, a girl is raped by a minotaur and of course -- burn, witch, burn. The way the showrunners manage the density of crazy developments, without having it turn into a jokey soap-opera like True Blood (which qualifies as horror, I guess, as does Supernatural, but neither show even tries to be scary anymore) is a thing of beauty. The performances are uniformly excellent, the writing is passionate and exciting, and every aspect of the production is well-designed.

This season's performances by an extraordinary ensemble cast created a ""never a dull moment"" sense of wonder along with AHS's standard gore. Coven has a sense of fable or fairy tale mixed in with the expected gore, creating a fascinating switch from shock and repulsion to innocence and sweetness all within a single scene. On the sweetness side is the character of Misty Day, flawlessly portrayed by Lily Rabe. She is an archetype of the wild innocent who is forced to cope with a world that encroaches on her moss-covered retreat. So too are Zoe, Nan, and Queenie, the good witches of the story.  Jessica Lange can of course, do no wrong and Fiona gives us more depth than both her characters from season one and two. Unlike the first two seasons of AHS, there were characters I really liked in coven. Francis Conroy (another actress who is incapable of a bad performance) is terrific as Myrtle, the fashion obsessed (a la Andy Warhol factory graduate) member of the council. The visual cacophony of Myrtle's wardrobe is as captivating, as her personality.  Her untimely demise provides one of the season's most captivating scenes worthy of Edward Gorey's best efforts. Really, a red dress to die for! Ryan Murphy's various visions of hell; from being eternally trapped serving in a fried chicken joint, to Fiona's tortured pronouncement of KNOTTY PINE ring true for many of us. I found myself wondering what would mine look like? Hell seems to be mindless horrific repetition for Murphy, someone who has avoided the same with each season of AHS. From Angela Bassett's slinkingly seductive voodoo queen to Kathy Bate's corseted moldy oldie, it's visual atmospheric feast. And hats off to Stevie Nicks!

I find it awesome how the show blends reality, fantasy, history and social commentary then coats it with a bit of comedy. I think this is the most unique tv show out there because of those things. I first was drawn to the show because it was starring Jessica Lange. Sadly I hear she may leave the show after next season. Hopefully they will keep Evan Peters, (is it just me or does he remind anyone else of a young Johnny Depp?). On the subject of actors the show does draw a few big names besides Jessica Lange.This season had Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates. Guest appearances were made by Stevie Nicks, (who does sing), which, in my opinion, speaks volumes of the popularity of this show. If you have never seen the show, you can pick any season to start from as each season has its own story. However I would start with 1 and go in order so you can enjoy the teasers, clues and understand the connections.",5,The Best Season So Far,1391472000,"02 4, 2014",2014,1137,"['favorite', 'season', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'writing', 'was', 'tight', 'been', 'beginning', 'series', 'really', 'enjoy', 'how', 'series', 'many', 'same', 'actors', 'presenting', 'new', 'concept', 'season', 'find', 'awesome', 'how', 'show', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'history', 'social', 'commentary', 'then', 'bit', 'comedy', 'think', 'most', 'unique', 'tv', 'show', 'there', 'things', 'first', 'was', 'drawn', 'show', 'was', 'starring', 'Jessica', 'Lange', 'Sadly', 'hear', 'may', 'leave', 'show', 'next', 'season', 'Hopefully', 'will', 'keep', 'Evan', 'Peters', 'just', 'remind', 'anyone', 'else', 'young', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'subject', 'actors', 'show', 'draw', 'few', 'big', 'names', 'Jessica', 'Lange.This', 'season', 'had', 'Angela', 'Bassett', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'Guest', 'appearances', 'were', 'made', 'Stevie', 'Nicks', 'who', 'sing', 'opinion', 'volumes', 'popularity', 'show', 'have', 'never', 'seen', 'show', 'can', 'pick', 'season', 'start', 'season', 'own', 'story', 'However', 'would', 'start', '1', 'go', 'order', 'can', 'enjoy', 'teasers', 'clues', 'understand', 'connections']",American Horror Story: Coven

What's odd is that there's an Amazon video player app for the iPad.

For those who don't know this season is about witches in a coven who are suppose to be trained to control their powers but none of that really happens they just use their powers to show off or get what they want. They also argue about who the next supreme is. Just watch it! It truly is a cool show which is written by Ryan Murphy the same guy who writes glee.

Maybe, that was why it didn't intrigue me as much, I have to say the beginning was somehow entertaining the first half of the series was interesting enough the second was watchable that's all.The reason for that is that the second season just seemed rushed and abrupt. Everything surrounding the plot made no more sense. Why would Fiona join in with her most sworn enemy the Voodoo Queen Marie Lavue? Whom she hates so much, whom tried to destroy her a couple of times? That plot twist wasn't as bad a$$ as the producers wanted us to believe, I found it more ridiculous than anything else. Also, why would Queenie free Madam whatever her face is after all the crimes she did? And Can Queenie make up her mind into who's side she's really in? And the whole love triangle story between Madison, Zoe and the walking dead just seemed dull and contrived. Why would two powerful witches conspire against each other for the attention of a zombie who's a puppet is beyond me! Teenage love is really annoying. The random killing scenes, that just seemed mindless. It really is like the writers haven't thought their ending through and rather just threw random conclusions to each and every character or plot line even if it made little to no sense. Believe me when I tell you all of them including the finale seemed so contrived and unconvincing.I hated the ending most of all, It seemed cartoonish and what not, I understand the producers wanted to throw at us one last shocker before the season ends but come on. That wasn't a shocker that was just laughable. You spent all that time guessing whos the next supreme and oh I should've thought about that before! Felt like I was viewing a Jumanji Cartoon episode rather than AHS. Yes, we do have a happy ending this season a boring happy ending.In short this season was non climatic. I guess, the only likeable season for me was Season One. Season two was a lot of mumbo jumbo with no direct line and purpose to it and this season was just dull. I recommend season One for anyone who wants to get an idea on what AHS can really be about. Otherwise do not waste your time.Maybe I'll watch the fourth season in hopes it would be better than these last two, finger crossed!

First I said, &#34;forget it&#34; then this morning ....because I'm still thinking about it.....I decided to write.  Audiences have always been drawn to macabre and futuristic adventure stories.  It's sort of a right of passage for a lot of folks.  Scary movies make you squeal and delight in the emotion of fright.  I am still drawn to the good scary movie...and love sci-if.  Abject Horror for Horror sake however, is not something, I delight in.  When I heard that Kathy Bates and other well known actors were starring in this series , I believed  the series to be of high quality.  Instead, I got to witness the most obscenely degenerate acts of torture, dehumanizing rape scenes, incestuous sexual encounters ( between  a mother and her zombie son, no less) blood, hatred, and demented behavior.  Ok, think  I sound like a prude?  Please!  What makes me most disappointed is the lack of cohesive plot, pace and the over abundance of gratuitous starring scenes.  Katy Bates is wonderful as is Angela Basset........too bad the script doesn't give them much plot to follow ...... Only hatred and antagonism .

Plus, there was not only the triple-threat of Jessica Lange-Kathy Bates-Angela Bassett, but the welcome return of Taissa Farmiga, along with many of the superb players from Seasons One-Two.There are a lot of nifty little storylines and clever subplots rattling around, here, but there is no cohesive quality to the writing and, as a result, these clever bits just seem to drift off into the ether, or worse: show up at the wrong moments. The narrative seems scattered, fragmented, disconnected and often arbitrary. That was the biggest strike against Season Two, and I was hoping the writing would be much tighter with 'Coven.' No such luck. Jessica Lange still rivets you to the screen and her scenes are chewy and spectacular, but Kathy Bates (whose Madame LaLaurie showed such POW! and potential in Episode One) is being woefully underutilized and her character underwritten. Angela Bassett is also being underused. These offenses alone are unforgivable when you have such mighty actresses at your table.One gets the sense that Murphy is trying to keep way too many plates spinning in the air with this new installment, and some of the dishware is smashing to the floor. Season One had a lot of different characters, too, but they were used judiciously to serve the primary storyline. Nothing seemed wasted or pasted together with preschooler's glue. I think they needed to keep a much more constant, myopic focus on tension regarding the Fiona-Marie LaVeaux power struggle, with outside characters and storylines feeding into that chief plot and being at the service of that ongoing struggle. That would have given the narrative some solid direction, some churn. As it is, the whole thing seems aimless, thus far, with some truly awful/silly/unnecessary distractions, e.g. that Witches Council -- whah? They're not funny, they're badly written into the story, get RID of them! No such luck there, either, evidently ... Without venturing into spoiler territory.As I said, however, AHS: Coven is still better than 90% of the scripted stuff on TV and is still great entertainment. The acting is uniformly excellent even when the writing lets everybody down and because of the great charisma of the cast alone I will continue to enjoy it and watch regularly. I just won't BUY anymore episodes, or the DVD collection, when it comes out, and *that* is a huge difference from the superbly written Season One and the fine-but-flawed Season Two. Not worth owning, thus far, Falchuk and Murphy. Prove me wrong by the end of the season, please, but you'll have to do it fast. Your story is running away from you.

Every episode made my skin crawl. I felt like I had to take a shower afterwards.So far, Coven doesn't measure up. It's not as intense. It's not creepy or sick. And it's far from dark. It's entertaining, yes, because I love seeing those same actors play different roles. Jessica Lange is remarkable to the point of uncanny, otherworldly.But the episodes don't really hold my attention for some reason. A show about teenage and/or twentysomething witches has been done before. (Harry Potter, Charmed, even Buffy.) Plus, I never could suspend disbelief on characters with supernatural abilities so off-the-charts powerful that, really, what could possibly oppose them? If these characters were this powerful, why would they be sitting around in a school for witches?The writing isn't as good as the first two seasons. And the camera work is driving me nuts. An occasional tracking shot at a weird angle, maybe. Fisheye lenses, okay. Strange places to position a camera to achieve maximum oddness, check. But a little goes a long, long way. It's like the current Hollywood trend to jerk the camera all around during action scenes -- or even scenes that have no action. After awhile, I feel like throwing up there's so much movement on the screen. (I actually walked out of the first Hunger Games movie. The constantly-in-motion camera -- even during a conversation between two people -- drove me right up the wall...and out of the theater.)Whenever a director does too much with his camera, he becomes intrusive. Or, to put it another way, when the camera becomes another character, it's time to move on.Coven is approaching that line for me.The plot seems thin as a rail, too. So far, nothing much is happening.

Based on other reviews, AHS Coven is an uneven ""love it or hate it"" season.Jessica Lange conveys the once exquisite, but waning ""Supreme"" witch, Fiona Goode to perfection.  Immortal Angela Basset as voodoo queen Marie Laveau imparts wisdom and menace acquired over 300 years - seamlessly straddling present and past. Kathy Bates (Madame Delphine LaLaurie), entombed for 180 years has lost none of her edge. The more things change, the more they stay the same. Subtle black/white themes - in dress, personality traits and racial undertones - embellish the duality of good vs evil inherent in everyone.Frances Conroy (Myrtle Snow), this time with frizzy russet hair and crazy spectacles (almost a parody of eccentric flame-haired couturier Vivienne Westwood) is given more screen time in the back end, clearly relishing the diversity of characters she gets to play in each season. Sarah Paulson as Fiona's neglected, insecure daughter Cordelia conveys humiity, infirmity and poise, transmogrifying herself convincingly.The four principal men - Evan Peters (Kyle), Dennis O'Hare (Spalding), Josh Hamilton (Hank Foxx) and Danny Huston as The Ax Man - support this strong female cast admirably.With the exception of psychic Jamie Brewer (Nan) whose fort&eacute; remains hers alone, the rest of the young witches are wishy washy or stereotyped, their talents melding into shades of the same as they consider their suitability for top spot. Despite a nomination for ""Precious"", Gabourey Sidibe's performance as ""Queenie"" is mediocre at best.Explicit murder and butchery aside, almost every aberration is covered - incest, racism, torture, animism, chimera, necrophilia, sorcery, self-mutilation, filicide, matricide, narcissism - more than once!Stevie Nick's inclusion appears initially contrived, but adds an appropriate twist later on with her Fleetwood Mac classic, ""Seven Wonders"".So what is wrong with it? Superb performances cannot rescue a pedestrian, predictable plot that fumbles mid-season, becoming repetitive. Almost everyone is either immortal, or killed off only to resurface (sometimes as off-centre un-deads), or in the case of the Ax Man, rescued from limbo.  Naturally Halloween had to feature, as a vehicle for zombies to wreak more havoc.These so-called wise, all-knowing witches are too easily manipulated by one another, navely switching allegiances. Maybe Nan's psychic abilities were contagious, because there were few surprises - in dialog or storyline.It does find it's footing in the last two episodes, with a satisfying, if not wholly original ending and is definitely worth staying with for the performances alone.

Normally, I am not one to watch horror themed television, but I gave it a chance due to my coworker&#8217;s persuasive take on why the show is captivating.  The show centers around the time periods of the 1800s and modern day as supernatural rivalries surface between witches such as the characters of Fiona Good, Myrtle Snow, Marie Laveau, and Misty Day. Despite her own hardened nature,Fiona has a daughter named Cordelia who she loves very much. Fiona and Cordelia end up becoming mentors to the young witches in training: Queenie,Zoe Benson, Madison Montgomery, and Nan. Fiona is doing her best to convince her daughter Cordelia to prepare her young prot&eacute;g&eacute;s for the magical battles that are about to take place.  Initially, Cordelia sees her mom more as a nuisance and just wants her to go away.  For justified reasons, Fiona is also naturally suspicious of the motives involving her daughter&#8217;s husband.  The prot&eacute;g&eacute;s are far from shrieking violets themselves. I must refrain from explaining why for those who have yet to see the show, but the reasons for my analysis of the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s are seen within the first four episodes. In modern day, witch Marie Laveau and Fiona Good end up having one of the most heated rivalries for certain reasons. This is what I am about to lead into.  The other actors and actresses of this season contribute to the plot growth of American Horror Story: Coven in unexpected ways. However, I have to confess that my favorite characters from season 3 of American Horror Story: Coven are a tie between Jessica Lange&#8217;s Fiona Good character and Angela Bassett&#8217;s Marie Laveau character.  I enjoyed Angela Bassett&#8217;s terrific portrayal as Marie Laveau because she powerfully held her own magic against forces of racism and being threatened with an old enemy. Angela Bassett&#8217;s Laveau character also has a magical gift of &#8220;summoning&#8221; what she requests to carry out her aims. Despite the sinister character nature, I also like Jessical Lange&#8217;s Fiona Good character due to the fact that she plays a woman who is not afraid to confront the evils of racism during the series and plays both a strong and resilient spirit. For instance, Lange convincingly plays a Fiona Good persona who is not afraid to tell Delphine LaLaurie that she got what was coming to her for her evil ways during the 1830&#8217;s as a blood thirsty socialite. Lange&#8217;s Fiona Good character also showed a brilliant complexity when making it clear that she will not tolerate racism and appropriately making La Laurie serve Queenie (after LaLaurie made some disparaging racial remarks to Queenie). I also saw the humanity in her when she got two of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s out of brief brushes with the law and came to the aid of a mother in a hospital. Last, but not least, showing the will to keep on going in life even as those around her try to indirectly drive her to suicide.",5,Supernatural Horror Story Of A Twisted Coven,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,3087,"['American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Coven', 'caught', 'interest', 'coworker', 'job', 'recommended', 'television', 'series', 'Normally', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'watch', 'horror', 'themed', 'television', 'gave', 'chance', 'due', 'coworker', '8217', 's', 'persuasive', 'take', 'why', 'show', 'captivating', 'show', 'time', 'periods', '1800s', 'modern', 'day', 'supernatural', 'rivalries', 'surface', 'witches', 'such', 'characters', 'Fiona', 'Good', 'Myrtle', 'Snow', 'Marie', 'Laveau', 'Misty', 'Day', 'own', 'hardened', 'nature', 'Fiona', 'daughter', 'named', 'Cordelia', 'who', 'very', 'much', 'Fiona', 'Cordelia', 'end', 'up', 'becoming', 'mentors', 'young', 'witches', 'training', 'Queenie', 'Zoe', 'Benson', 'Madison', 'Montgomery', 'Nan', 'Fiona', 'doing', 'best', 'convince', 'daughter', 'Cordelia', 'prepare', 'young', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 's', 'magical', 'battles', 'are', 'take', 'place', 'Initially', 'Cordelia', 'mom', 'more', 'nuisance', 'just', 'go', 'away', 'justified', 'reasons', 'Fiona', 'also', 'naturally', 'suspicious', 'motives', 'involving', 'daughter', '8217', 's', 'husband', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'are', 'far', 'shrieking', 'violets', 'must', 'refrain', 'explaining', 'why', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'show', 'reasons', 'analysis', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'are', 'seen', 'first', 'four', 'episodes', 'modern', 'day', 'witch', 'Marie', 'Laveau', 'Fiona', 'Good', 'end', 'up', 'having', 'one', 'most', 'heated', 'rivalries', 'certain', 'reasons', 'what', 'am', 'lead', 'other', 'actors', 'actresses', 'season', 'contribute', 'plot', 'growth', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Coven', 'unexpected', 'ways', 'However', 'have', 'confess', 'favorite', 'characters', 'season', '3', 'American', 'Horror', 'Story', 'Coven', 'are', 'tie', 'Jessica', 'Lange', '8217', 'Fiona', 'Good', 'character', 'Angela', 'Bassett', '8217', 'Marie', 'Laveau', 'character', 'enjoyed', 'Angela', 'Bassett', '8217', 'terrific', 'portrayal', 'Marie', 'Laveau', 'powerfully', 'held', 'own', 'magic', 'forces', 'racism', 'being', 'threatened', 'old', 'enemy', 'Angela', 'Bassett', '8217', 'Laveau', 'character', 'also', 'magical', 'gift', '8220', 'summoning', '8221', 'what', 'carry', 'out', 'aims', 'sinister', 'character', 'nature', 'also', 'like', 'Jessical', 'Lange', '8217', 'Fiona', 'Good', 'character', 'due', 'fact', 'woman', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'confront', 'evils', 'racism', 'series', 'strong', 'resilient', 'spirit', 'instance', 'Lange', 'convincingly', 'Fiona', 'Good', 'persona', 'who', 'not', 'afraid', 'tell', 'Delphine', 'LaLaurie', 'got', 'what', 'was', 'coming', 'evil', 'ways', '1830', '8217', 'blood', 'thirsty', 'socialite', 'Lange', '8217', 'Fiona', 'Good', 'character', 'also', 'showed', 'brilliant', 'complexity', 'when', 'making', 'clear', 'will', 'not', 'tolerate', 'racism', 'appropriately', 'making', 'La', 'Laurie', 'serve', 'Queenie', 'LaLaurie', 'made', 'disparaging', 'racial', 'remarks', 'Queenie', 'also', 'saw', 'humanity', 'when', 'got', 'two', 'prot', 'eacute', 'eacute', 'brief', 'brushes', 'law', 'came', 'aid', 'mother', 'hospital', 'Last', 'not', 'least', 'showing', 'will', 'keep', 'going', 'life', 'even', 'try', 'indirectly', 'drive', 'suicide']",American Horror Story: Coven

Then on to Taissa Farmiga, brought back from season 1 as she discovers her power and gets swept off to special witch school in NOLA Hogwarts style.  We have Jessica Lange as the Supreme witch, bringing her A-game again as an aging witch trying to gain  back her youth, as she joins her daughter played by Sara Paulson (the potion creating witch), to ""help"" her at her special girls' school. We get a Mean Girls/Teen Witch snarkiness of young teenage witches meeting each other for the first time, with Emma Roberts, Gabare Sidibe (Award Nominee for Precious).  Denis O'Hare as the strange mute butler.  Also get brief glimpses in this episode of Evan Peters, Angela Bassett as our resident VooDoo Queen, and Francis Conroy.  I think this could be the best season of yet of this show.  I like that this series while fictional uses factual elements from our history in their depiction of horror.  Great writing with their cut and dry snarky one-liners.  ""Maybe I'll drop a house on you"".  ""That one there - she's smarter than all of you put together"", ""Is that your superpower, sensing dehydration"" ""The light hit him just fine"".

Next I will research season 1.  They are just that superior.First off, Sibide and Roberts are talentless and annoying, respectively.  Both are supposed to be strong and confident.  Sibide is monotone and emotionless while Roberts fails at being a dimestore whore.  Both are just terrible.Bates is utterly wasted in this role.  During the flashbacks, we get glimpses of her psychotic genius a la ""Misery"", but the storyline and pitiful support leave us totally unfulfilled.Lange was simply amazing in the previous two seasons.  Her range as the embattled Sister Jude was such an experience to watch.  Here? I actually had to think about what her name is on this season.  Like Bates, a talent is squandered.Paulson is whiny.  That's it. From the get-go, she's annoying.  Again, her Lana Winters of season 2 was someone for whom I could cheer.  Here, I just want her to be put down.The only performances I've enjoyed are Bassett and Peters.  Bassett is simply gorgeous and sinister without apology.  She looks even better now than she did when she played Tina Turner.  One could believe she is immortal.  Peters, in his minimalist performance, is vulnerable and likeable.  You can't help but feel for him.  These two are the only reasons I will eventually finish the season.I sincerely hope AHS gets back to stories and actors worthy of the first 2 seasons.

Some of them, like Fox, are great at putting their stuff online.

There's benefits lol... Mostly bad things tho; cable companies can be expensive.. Again, charging a premium for shows you can (at some point) get online.If you like witches, great acting, great directing and a nice story line (not to mention Cathy Bates is in it) then this is the show for you...YAY for the upcoming [new Season of AHS].

She plays ( Marie Laveau ) a character based on the real life New Orleans voodoo queen of the the same name with a few minor alterations, Angela turns out a stellar performance. ( Cathy Bates ) another great actress does to playing a cruel sadistic rich overweight ugly woman who is obsessed with maintaining her youth one of the ingredients is eek human blood she gets from the poor slaves she tortures. They did an amazing job using the stuff they used to make her look ugly almost didn't recognize her, you will hate her character and want her dead I do muwhahahaIt starts with various young girls with powers who have just become members of an elite private school for witches who've come there to train. At a party after the new girls friend is drugged by one of the local colleges hot guys he and some of his uddies gang rape her some filming it with cell phones, eew, when the new girl finds out she begins plotting. The only good one of the group comes to the room sees it and fights them off they drag him out of the house and into the school bus while some beat him they take off intent on silencing him for good. The victim comes around and uses her power to flip the bus. The new girl goes to the hospital finds the rape ringleaders room goes in closes the door and gives him a gruesome treat, you'll say holy ? I did.An infertile woman comes to Marie Laveau ( Angela Bassett ) asking Marie to use her magic to help her conceive. They set up and hold a voodoo ceremony with a fire drums magic offerings authentic tribal dancing, part of the ritual involves passing around a special jar with something in it. Marie puts a red pepper on her tongue eats it dances and goes into a trance and that's when the ritual really takes off. From what I saw in a few previews it is mindblowingly amazing.

But like the previous two seasons, the story will just go off on a side detour and derail at times.  Kathy Bates is fantastic in it as a non-witch but just as evil woman dug up from the past.  Jessica Lange is good as the head witch but sometimes she diverts into chewing up the scenery that becomes too drawn out.  The young actresses playing the younger witches do a great job.  This seemed to be the American Horror Story written to appeal to a younger crowd of high school and college aged girls.  There are no strong male characters in this season.

I decided on 3 because there are two different qualities to consider. Acting/production and writing/directing are on different levels. While the acting and production is great, the unrestrained portryal of perversion is astonishing.I am afraid that the writers have reached the lowest rung of the ladder on this one. While the first two seasons of the series were difficult to watch, but fascinating in high quality production, Season 3 features the most vile perversions in mankind. Please keep in mind that I have only seen two episodes of the series so far. It is sickening to think of children possibly either seeing this deliberately or by accident. Do not buy it.The story is very intriguing but marred by over-the-top gore and perversion. I got the feeling that the writer/director was afraid that no one would like it if he didn't top the macabre stories in Seasons One and Two. Well, it certainly has been topped those.I will give it a few more chances. The cast is terrific, especially Kathy Bates, and the quality of production is very high for a television series. Jessica Lange turns in another skillful but heavy handed performance as an evil incarnation. It troubles me that she is always drawn to playing such dark characters. She seems to enjoy being damnable a little too much. Angela Bassett is very good in her role. The supporting cast is capable and they deliver well in their individual roles.I am hopeful that the next episodes will overcome the frightnight cheapness of the first two episodes, the first being the worst. If the later episodes show some hint of redeeming qualities,I will finish the series.
