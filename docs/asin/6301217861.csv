Within that time we meet Preston Tucker(Jeff Bridges)his wife Vera(Joan Allen)and the rest of  his family. Also,and this is really a high point of the film,we are  introduced to Abe Karatz(Martin Landau). Landau's performance is simply  wonderful to watch. It's one of the many reason he remains one of my  favorite actors. But besides the acting in this movie there's more to catch  your eye. I personally love stories about the 40's. I just love the style  of it all. The way people dressed,the cars,and the music. So I thought that  the production designs by Dean Tavoularis and the costume designs by Milena  Canonero were exquisite. Vittorio Stararo camerawork is always masterfully  done. Plus if all of this were not enough,Coppola directing is very  good,not perfect,but good. But,it's after all of these outstanding moments  that the film shifts gears. We go from the wonderful start this film had,of  a man wanting to build the &quot;car of the future&quot;,to a melodrama! I  really started to lose interest when the &quot;court room&quot; drama  started. It was all so,well...hollywood! It lost the &quot;innocence&quot;  it has attained in the beginning. The wonderful warmth of a man wanting to  build his dream car,and turned into a boring movie.

247007,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6301217861,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Color me surprised, but I really liked this movie.  On the outset, I just thought it was going to be a bore, but Francis Ford Coppola and the film's star, Jeff Bridges, bring so much flash and life and overall presence to this film that I couldn't help but get sucked into every frame.The film centers on Preston Tucker.  I was unaware that this was a biopic, but thought that it was a fictional story until the very end of the film where I was told that it was a true story.  I love that.  Tucker's story is a simple one.  He had a dream, to make the car of the future, and through his own determination and inhibition, he almost brought that dream to life.  He got the funds and started his long journey towards fulfilling that dream, only to have it shot down by hotshots in fear of the competition and wound up having to defend his own work before a jury.With great style that never takes the place of substance, Coppola crafts an expert film that lives and breathes an era and jumps to life scene after scene.  With a rich score and impressive technical aspects (those costumes and sets are lavish and beautiful) and an ensemble that embody the emotional tones of the film, `Tucker: The Man and His Dream' makes the most of its title and gives us a dreamy retelling of an inspiring story.  While Landau walked away with the only acting nomination here, it is the film's core, Jeff Bridges, who deserves to be singled out.  With equal parts comedic brilliance and dramatic underscoring, Bridges creates a real man with ambitions that overtake his simple existence.  I particularly loved his closing speech because it puts all the other courtroom actors to shame.  He knows how to sell a monologue, and he did so with grace, style and presence.This is a fun film that has something to say and it says it well.

Enter into the picture Preston Tucker, a successful inventor who had ideas to create an affordable, reliable and safe family automobile (yes, a revolutionary concept, even in the 1940s).His ""Tucker 48"" auto included a rear-mounted, fuel-injected engine, disk brakes, seat belts and a padded dash, a front windshield that popped out during a severe crash, push-button controls and a third front headlight that turned while the driver was steering.Seen as a threat to the marketing plans of the auto industry, Tucker's dream is destroyed in the hallowed halls of the federal government that winds it way through the senate chambers and stops at the desk of the president. Only 51 cars were produced.Initially shot like the slick corporate promotional films of the 1950s to creatively present an overview of this buried history, Tucker: The Man and His Dream is a reminder how the power of influence & greed manipulates the marionette of business & government.",5,The Dream Betrayed,1166227200,"12 16, 2006",2006,1350,"['story', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'produced', 'Gerge', 'Lucas', 'outstanding', 'performance', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'inventor', 'who', 'dreamed', 'too', 'large', 'wonderful', 'American', 'Dream.After', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'automobile', 'industry', 'guise', 'Big', 'Three', 'were', 'poised', 'convert', 'manufacturing', 'plants', 'back', 'soon-to-be', 'burgeoning', 'domestic', 'market', 'Enter', 'picture', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'successful', 'inventor', 'who', 'had', 'ideas', 'create', 'affordable', 'reliable', 'safe', 'family', 'automobile', 'yes', 'revolutionary', 'concept', 'even', '1940s', '.His', 'Tucker', '48', 'auto', 'included', 'rear-mounted', 'fuel-injected', 'engine', 'disk', 'brakes', 'seat', 'belts', 'padded', 'dash', 'front', 'windshield', 'popped', 'out', 'severe', 'crash', 'push-button', 'controls', 'third', 'front', 'headlight', 'turned', 'driver', 'was', 'steering.Seen', 'threat', 'marketing', 'plans', 'auto', 'industry', 'Tucker', 'dream', 'destroyed', 'hallowed', 'halls', 'federal', 'government', 'way', 'senate', 'chambers', 'stops', 'desk', 'president', 'Only', '51', 'cars', 'were', 'produced.Initially', 'shot', 'slick', 'corporate', 'promotional', 'films', '1950s', 'creatively', 'present', 'overview', 'buried', 'history', 'Tucker', 'Man', 'Dream', 'reminder', 'how', 'power', 'influence', 'greed', 'marionette', 'business', 'government']",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS

Most importantly it is a well crafted and engaging entertainment.It has a seasoned cast, is well written, is superbly directed, and has a perfectly pitched score that does not intrude. Set design and period locations and sets are wonderfully done, and it even features the wonderful car itself.This is a true story about a visionary who came up against the greed and profit machine in his quest to build a better automobile WHEN it SHOULD have become revolutionary. It proves that we have the inspiration within ourselves to see a better way. The system we're stuck with somehow is controlled by HACKS who are too cowardly to be revolutionary. Especially in the automotive world. The Rand devotees who made their lousy propaganda piece represent a half baked version of the Tuckers of the world. They want to be free of the controlling hacks and be unfettered in the pursuit of wealth and egotistical self fulfillment. They ARE the hacks now, as exemplified by the Republican political field in this country. The difference? The Tuckers of the world are the true entrepreneurs who want uncompromised visions fulfilled....But not only for themselves to prosper and be fulfilled and confident....they work to better the world, for all humans and the planet, and this is truly American and Progressive. It strengthens the nation and the individual citizen. Nikola Tesla and Steve Jobs are other such persons. Rarely does the proper respect go to the one who deserves the most recognition.

247014,A3C4OFD6CMRN10,6301217861,"Colin Nickell ""Movie Guru""","[3, 13]","Francis Ford Coppola directs the story of Preston Tucker, a man who dared to think outside the box and invent one of the greatest automobiles (In my opinion) ever made. Jeff Bridges plays Preston Tucker in this ""interesting look at American Automotive History"" says IMDB.com.The film is about how Preston Tucker went through struggles with corporations to create his dream car, The Tucker. Despite his lack of steel and other supplies Preston uses scrap cars to develop these incredible vehicles. But when the industry tries to take Preston's dreams and mold them for their own purposes Preston rebels against the industry.  His rebel acts end him up in court where he accused of not having any intent on even making the cars and stealing government money. Fortunately he was found not guilty.Now I personally did not care much for this film, and let me tell you why. Coppola was taking part in Lucas and Spielberg's clich&eacute; feel good film era. Now I know this a true story, but I personally do not care much for the producer Lucas when it comes to cinema politics. Look at other films from this little fad that Steven and he started; Land Before Time (Producer), Willow (Producer), The Young Indiana Jones series (Producer). Now as a filmmaker, I feel these feel good adventures are just in there for the extra buck and a good credit towards him. Tucker was just another brick in the wall in this franchise that Lucas was racking up. He was better off with the Star Wars series.Coppola did a good job from the filming aspect, I like the God shots when your viewing the factory. I also like the fifties feel he pulled off quite smoothly, if the film quality wasn't as good I'd actually think this was made in the fifties. But via DVD makes the quality unbelievable.I like the father son acting rivalry between Jeff Bridges and Lloyd Bridges is wonderful. Both great actors that have great credentials; Jeff is in thriller classic Arlington Road and Lloyd is in comedy cult classic Airplane.I suggest maybe some of Coppola's earlier and better works. Like the classic and nominated as the greatest film of all time The Godfather. A Vietnam classic and another Top Fifty of all time film is Apocalypse Now.So despite the cinema politics of the whole thing, this is a very decent film.",3,Tucker's dream isn't that memorable,1111881600,"03 27, 2005",2005,2288,"['Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'story', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'man', 'who', 'dared', 'think', 'box', 'invent', 'one', 'greatest', 'automobiles', 'opinion', 'ever', 'made', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'interesting', 'look', 'American', 'Automotive', 'History', 'IMDB.com.The', 'film', 'how', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'went', 'struggles', 'corporations', 'create', 'dream', 'car', 'Tucker', 'lack', 'steel', 'other', 'supplies', 'Preston', 'scrap', 'cars', 'develop', 'incredible', 'vehicles', 'when', 'industry', 'take', 'Preston', 'dreams', 'mold', 'own', 'purposes', 'Preston', 'rebels', 'industry', 'rebel', 'acts', 'end', 'up', 'court', 'where', 'accused', 'not', 'having', 'intent', 'even', 'making', 'cars', 'stealing', 'government', 'money', 'Fortunately', 'was', 'found', 'not', 'guilty.Now', 'personally', 'did', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'film', 'let', 'tell', 'why', 'Coppola', 'was', 'taking', 'part', 'Lucas', 'Spielberg', 'clich', 'eacute', 'feel', 'good', 'film', 'era', 'Now', 'know', 'true', 'story', 'personally', 'do', 'not', 'care', 'much', 'producer', 'Lucas', 'when', 'cinema', 'politics', 'Look', 'other', 'films', 'little', 'fad', 'Steven', 'started', 'Land', 'Time', 'Producer', 'Willow', 'Producer', 'Young', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'series', 'Producer', 'Now', 'filmmaker', 'feel', 'feel', 'good', 'adventures', 'are', 'just', 'extra', 'buck', 'good', 'credit', 'towards', 'Tucker', 'was', 'just', 'brick', 'wall', 'franchise', 'Lucas', 'was', 'racking', 'up', 'was', 'better', 'off', 'Star', 'Wars', 'series.Coppola', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'filming', 'aspect', 'like', 'God', 'shots', 'when', 'viewing', 'factory', 'also', 'fifties', 'feel', 'pulled', 'off', 'quite', 'smoothly', 'film', 'quality', 'was', ""n't"", 'good', ""'d"", 'actually', 'think', 'was', 'made', 'fifties', 'DVD', 'quality', 'unbelievable.I', 'father', 'son', 'acting', 'rivalry', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Lloyd', 'Bridges', 'wonderful', 'great', 'actors', 'have', 'great', 'credentials', 'Jeff', 'thriller', 'classic', 'Arlington', 'Road', 'Lloyd', 'comedy', 'cult', 'classic', 'Airplane.I', 'suggest', 'maybe', 'Coppola', 'earlier', 'better', 'works', 'classic', 'nominated', 'greatest', 'film', 'time', 'Godfather', 'A', 'Vietnam', 'classic', 'Top', 'Fifty', 'time', 'film', 'Apocalypse', 'Now.So', 'cinema', 'politics', 'whole', 'thing', 'very', 'decent', 'film']",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS

But this theme is not really even touched on in the film, and only glancingly so in the commentary by Coppola, when the filmmaker muses that newer Internet technology likely makes it easier to succeed against the powers that be (no quite so, Francis!).

And being an undercapitalized entrepreneur in a capital intensive industry, he was rather easy prey for those who already had vast amounts of money, political connections, and a great many wartime favors to call in.The viewer knows from the opening chase scene in the non-existent mountains of Ypsilanti, Michigan that certain facts are going to be sacrificed in favor of telling a certain kind of story.  The website tuckerclub dot org details the differences between this movie (which the club loves) and reality. There are some especially fine performances in this film.  Of course, Jeff Bridges is terrific as the never say die and flamboyant Tucker, and Joan Allen as his wife.  Martin Landau was rightly acclaimed for his terrific performance as Abe Karatz - an early Tucker supporter.Of course, one of the big stars in the film is the car.  There are many of the surviving actual Tucker vehicles shown in this film (as well as some cosmetic props).  It is a terrific design for its time that owners still treasure today.Preston Tucker can still be evaluated in a variety of ways.  When does the showman become a charlatan or when does an entrepreneur struggling for survival become a con man?  Different people judge these things a bit differently.  This movie is very sympathetic to the man and his dream and very much worth seeing as an entertaining story as well as a piece of our industrial history.",4,A good story as well as a piece of our industrial history told quite sympathetically,1150848000,"06 21, 2006",2006,1612,"['bio-pic', 'broad', 'strokes', 'charismatic', 'personality', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'dream', 'how', 'challenge', 'status', 'quo', 'brought', 'great', 'many', 'powerful', 'people', 'being', 'undercapitalized', 'entrepreneur', 'capital', 'intensive', 'industry', 'was', 'rather', 'easy', 'prey', 'who', 'already', 'had', 'vast', 'amounts', 'money', 'political', 'connections', 'great', 'many', 'wartime', 'favors', 'call', 'in.The', 'viewer', 'knows', 'opening', 'chase', 'scene', 'non-existent', 'mountains', 'Ypsilanti', 'Michigan', 'certain', 'facts', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'sacrificed', 'favor', 'telling', 'certain', 'kind', 'story', 'website', 'tuckerclub', 'dot', 'org', 'details', 'differences', 'movie', 'club', 'reality', 'are', 'especially', 'fine', 'performances', 'film', 'course', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'terrific', 'never', 'say', 'die', 'flamboyant', 'Tucker', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'wife', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'was', 'rightly', 'acclaimed', 'terrific', 'performance', 'Abe', 'Karatz', 'early', 'Tucker', 'supporter.Of', 'course', 'one', 'big', 'stars', 'film', 'car', 'are', 'many', 'surviving', 'actual', 'Tucker', 'vehicles', 'shown', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'cosmetic', 'props', 'terrific', 'design', 'time', 'owners', 'still', 'treasure', 'today.Preston', 'Tucker', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'evaluated', 'variety', 'ways', 'When', 'showman', 'become', 'charlatan', 'when', 'entrepreneur', 'struggling', 'survival', 'become', 'con', 'man', 'Different', 'people', 'judge', 'things', 'bit', 'differently', 'movie', 'very', 'sympathetic', 'man', 'dream', 'very', 'much', 'worth', 'seeing', 'entertaining', 'story', 'as', 'well', 'piece', 'industrial', 'history']",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS

247023,AOYTQFRLD8VLP,6301217861,Deborah Earle,"[1, 2]","Detroit native Francis Ford Coppola's bright, shiny and optimistic film, dedicated to his late son, Gio,who loved cars, and honoring a revolutionary auto maker, captures the spirit of postwar America.In the 20 years since I, and many others were introduced to Preston Thomas Tucker, so blithely and enthusiatically played by Jeff Bridges, he has become a public figure I've come to admire simply because the vindication of his judgement about the future of the auto industry, the technological advances that needed to be made, and the consequences of the suppression of individual innovativeness was long in coming. Basically, society had to learn the hard way that he was right.We are introduced to the innovative visionary at his home in 1945 Ypsilanti, Michigan where he builds cars in his barn, and astounds his loving family and maid Millie (Patti Austin) with a bevy of trained Dalmatians he purchased in exchange for his Packard.His wife, Vera (a pretty, assertive, and charismatic Joan Allen) shares his enthusiasm about his projects and lends herself beautifully to the task of aiding him in his business dealings, and his delightful children, including Junior (a devoted Christian Slater), lovely daughter Marilyn Lee (a lively and pert Nina Siemaszko), and younger sons, Noble and Johnny(Corin Nemec and Anders Johnson) round out the picture of a geniunely happy family, and  Abe Karatz( Oscar nominee, Martin Landau), Eddie Dean (Frederic Forrest), Jimmy Sakuyama(Mako), and auto designer Alex Tremulis (Elias Koteas) constitute Tucker's coterie of loyal employees.Influenced by Gallup polls expressing American's desire to have new cars after World War II ended, Tucker begins to design a newer model with modernized safety features, and when he advertises the prototype in a magazine, he meets resistance but he also attracts young Tremulis, a young engineering student about to be discharged from the Army, to seek employment with him, illustrating the eagerness of people to help bring about a good idea, and Tucker's willingness to give new talent a try.Regarding those who work with him, in hiring the Japanese Sakuyama, whose relatives were in a relocation camp, and the convicted felon Karatz, we see Tucker's willingness to trust people and give them a second chance irrespective of social or political boundaries.Tucker concocts a brilliant strategy to convince Washington D.C. bigwigs to finance his car by showing them graphic photos of auto accident victims who might have been spared if their cars had the safety features he advocated, while presiding over a luncheon: What they saw onscreen sent many to the men's room, but it was considered that these repulsed diners had some power to remedy the problem with which Tucker presented them.One Oscar Beasely(Roland Scrivner) a Special Assistant to the Administrator is impressed enough to meet with Tucker but expressed misgivings about Tucker's meeting with Michigan Senator Homer Ferguson (Jeff Bridge's illustrious father, Lloyd.--My more recent viewings of this film really made me focus on Jeff's strong physical resemblance to his Dad) a powerful but disreputable man with connections to the auto industry who maliciously schemes against Tucker.The pressure to get the car made within a brief time creates tension. But Frank(Marshall Bell) the Press Agent hired by Abe makes a promotional film, and on the day of the big presentation, the crew of engineers work up until the last minute. While subversive elements work behind the showroom curtain, the car is joyously received by the public.Tucker goes on a publicity tour as the family move to Chicago to be near the factory, and the acts of sabotage against the car begin to escalate. Mrs. Tucker endures a bit of condescention from Bennington as he reluctantly explains the inability to get materials for the car, and ultimately rejects all of Tucker's intended safety features as he tries to take over the company.Tucker and his oldest son fly West to meet Howard Hughes(Dean Stockwell). As they stand in the shadow of the Spruce Goose, Hughes explains that Ferguson is after him as well, but also informs Tucker about an aluminum plant with no government connections that will provide him with some material for his cars.A successful test run on the speed track leads to the resumption of manufacturing the car as it was originally designed.But Bennington ultimately shuts town the Tucker plant, and despite Tucker's ability to prove the roadworthiness of the cars, he is dragged into court on charges of fraud.At the film's climax Tucker speaks in his own defense, expounding a warning about sabotaging individual innovativeness that a 1988 audience knew all too well to be true.While Tucker is vindicated, and soon enough on to his next idea, perhaps the ultimate losers in the case were those who might have been saved had the auto industry adopted the use of Tucker's safety features sooner.However, one is never left with a sense of melancholy by this film. It is the story of one man's ultimate triumph over corporate-induced adversity,and while he may have intially succeeded only on a small scale, an inspiring tale of a true American hero.",5,Bright and

He introduced a design that was innovative, taking some features from aircrafts, with a style that was aerodynamic and with specifications that called for a rear engine, disc brakes and fuel injections.To finance his dream, Tucker sells dealerships before the auto is even in production and the major car manufacturers don't want a new player making trouble, so they set out to make life difficult for him. Tucker is accused of fraud and attempting to sell stock on a venture that has yet to bear fruit. So, the Securities and Exchange Commission files suit against Tucker, and finally... the process puts an end to his venture.The acting is superb; Jeff Bridges plays the optimist Tucker with great style. Martin Landau is excellent as the man who joins to make money in a business deal and ends up sharing the dreams of a visionary.  It was wonderful to see Joan Allen playing the role of the supportive wife, who puts up with much because she believes and shares her husband's dreams.The clothing designs are beautiful and stylish. While brief, the performance of father and son, Lloyd and Jeff Bridges are a welcome bonus.The movie is enjoyable and teaches how corporate greed and power hungry executives can eliminate competition and destroy the dreams of an entrepreneur, but in time... many of the design features Tucker wanted to offer in an automobile were adopted by the big auto makers and safety became not only a dream, but a mandate for manufacturers.

Here, Jeff gets to play a little bit of the good-natured kidder we've come to love ...  as Tucker, the eternal optimist and dreamer, we experience the reality that  all dreams are met with obstacles sometimes ...The flashy style of the  director has the look and feel of a Life magazine or Saturday Evening Post  piece ... it's hype, sure, but it attempts to capture the entreprenurial  spirit of post-war America with the swing music and stylish clothing ...  Excellent performances by Bridges (both of them!), Martin Landau and even  Christian Slater plays with much more subtlety than usual.  Dean Stockwell  does a pretty good Howard Hughes.Get this movie and be prepared to  simply sit back and enjoy it.

I guess I like corny things.  I like his father, Lloyd Bridges(who isn't corny in this movie) as the nasty Senator who has a big hand in destroying Tucker's dream.  Joan Allen is good as is that kid who sounds like Jack Nicholson, Christian Slater.  The cars are nice looking too and slick like the film.  The film utilized real, honest to goodness Tucker automobiles.  The flick has a zippy, jazzy score by Joe Jackson, and that song, ""Hold That Tiger,"" which is corny but fun.  Don't get me wrong; it's a well made film by Francis Ford Coppola whose best creative days, unfortunately, came way too early in his career.  Hey, life can really suck sometimes, especially when the evil forces of big business and Washington, D.C. are against you and your upstart, innovative, fledgling automobile company; and you just happen to be a loud mouthed, arrogant, self-proclaimed genius whose aim is to single handedly revolutionize the automobile business.  If nothing else the film tells the story of an ambitious, enthusiastic guy who bit off more than he could chew by challenging some capitalist giants who gave him a capitalist bloody nose.  P.S.

247044,A20ITI6SAIKPK4,6301217861,Hoosier Hayseed,"[0, 0]","Some have labeled this the ""David vs Goliath"" story, and they are right.  The ""Powers That Be"" saw that they were about to have their heads handed to them by a true dreamer and innovator, and so they used their clout and muscle to shut him up.Not that you could blame them, looking at it from their point of view.Another reviewer compared it to what Howard Hughes had to go through.  But if you think about him, all he had to do was create a solution for a problem that no one thought had a solution; somehow, get supplies to Europe, when Hitler's U-Boats were sinking every cargo ship that put out to sea.  And so he thought of a giant cargo plane, which could take off and land on water, which really wasn't a new concept; after all, there were already ships (huge ships) and seaplanes, so the idea was just one of stretching the two concepts somewhat.But they threw a few monkey wrenches and sand into Howard Hughes' gears - namely, by telling him that he couldn't use any war-scarce materials, like steel, aluminum, or copper.Try that one on for size!  And so he deemed to make it out of wood.  But not just any wood - he devised a very unique concept of using a waterproof super-glue to bond and coat thin layers of hardwood together, for strength and lightness of weight, and built his airplane.But hardwood is just naturally very heavy anyway.  Most wood is, except balsa wood, but you could hardly build a huge cargo plane out of balsa wood.The bottom line was that the war was long since over before Howard Hughes' plane ever flew. They didn't need it for the war effort anymore - but he had the money and the pride to finish it, and see it flown, even if only once, for just a few feet, and by himself.He almost had to fly it at least once, just to prove to one and all that he hadn't been scamming the government out of the millions of dollars it had cost to build it, just to clear his own name and silence his critics.But the money was the key.  Howard Hughes had enough money to do exactly whatever he wanted to do, whereas Mr. Tucker was a lone eagle, not only broke but in debt, and butting heads with the most deeply entrenched fortress of big money, power, and smug greed in the world.The automobile industry was right up there with big oil and the railroads as the top industries of the day, back then.And so, he was actually beaten before he started, and once they realized that he had something that could seriously challenge their whole world, he was pretty much dead meat.Of course, as time went by, they appropriated his ideas, and why not?  Detroit has never been shy about stealing other people's ideas.  Just read the story, sometime, about the guy who invented the delayed windshield wiper, and how Detroit proceeded to put the screws to him, before he succeeded in getting a favorable judgement against them, to the tune of millions of dollars.And so, sometimes the little guy does win, but much more often, the Goliaths of this world just grind the Davids into the dirt.",5,David Didn't Have A Prayer,1318723200,"10 16, 2011",2011,3000,"['have', 'labeled', 'David', 'vs', 'Goliath', 'story', 'are', 'right', 'Powers', 'Be', 'saw', 'were', 'about', 'have', 'heads', 'handed', 'true', 'dreamer', 'innovator', 'so', 'used', 'clout', 'muscle', 'shut', 'up.Not', 'could', 'blame', 'looking', 'point', 'view.Another', 'reviewer', 'compared', 'what', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'had', 'go', 'think', 'all', 'had', 'do', 'was', 'create', 'solution', 'problem', 'one', 'thought', 'had', 'solution', 'somehow', 'get', 'supplies', 'Europe', 'when', 'Hitler', 'U-Boats', 'were', 'sinking', 'cargo', 'ship', 'put', 'out', 'sea', 'so', 'thought', 'giant', 'cargo', 'plane', 'could', 'take', 'off', 'land', 'water', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'new', 'concept', 'were', 'already', 'ships', 'huge', 'ships', 'seaplanes', 'idea', 'was', 'just', 'one', 'stretching', 'two', 'concepts', 'somewhat.But', 'threw', 'few', 'monkey', 'wrenches', 'sand', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'gears', 'namely', 'telling', 'could', ""n't"", 'use', 'war-scarce', 'materials', 'steel', 'aluminum', 'copper.Try', 'one', 'size', 'so', 'deemed', 'make', 'wood', 'not', 'just', 'wood', 'devised', 'very', 'unique', 'concept', 'using', 'waterproof', 'super-glue', 'bond', 'coat', 'thin', 'layers', 'hardwood', 'together', 'strength', 'lightness', 'weight', 'built', 'airplane.But', 'hardwood', 'just', 'naturally', 'very', 'heavy', 'anyway', 'Most', 'wood', 'balsa', 'wood', 'could', 'hardly', 'build', 'huge', 'cargo', 'plane', 'balsa', 'wood.The', 'bottom', 'line', 'was', 'war', 'was', 'long', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'plane', 'ever', 'flew', 'did', ""n't"", 'need', 'war', 'effort', 'anymore', 'had', 'money', 'pride', 'finish', 'see', 'flown', 'even', 'only', 'once', 'just', 'few', 'feet', 'himself.He', 'almost', 'had', 'fly', 'least', 'once', 'just', 'prove', 'one', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'scamming', 'government', 'millions', 'dollars', 'had', 'cost', 'build', 'just', 'clear', 'own', 'name', 'silence', 'critics.But', 'money', 'was', 'key', 'Howard', 'Hughes', 'had', 'enough', 'money', 'do', 'exactly', 'whatever', 'wanted', 'do', 'whereas', 'Mr.', 'Tucker', 'was', 'lone', 'eagle', 'not', 'only', 'broke', 'debt', 'butting', 'heads', 'most', 'deeply', 'entrenched', 'fortress', 'big', 'money', 'power', 'smug', 'greed', 'world.The', 'automobile', 'industry', 'was', 'right', 'there', 'big', 'oil', 'railroads', 'top', 'industries', 'day', 'back', 'then.And', 'so', 'was', 'actually', 'beaten', 'started', 'once', 'realized', 'had', 'something', 'could', 'seriously', 'challenge', 'whole', 'world', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'dead', 'meat.Of', 'course', 'time', 'went', 'appropriated', 'ideas', 'why', 'not', 'Detroit', 'never', 'been', 'shy', 'stealing', 'other', 'people', 'ideas', 'Just', 'read', 'story', 'sometime', 'guy', 'who', 'invented', 'delayed', 'windshield', 'wiper', 'how', 'Detroit', 'proceeded', 'put', 'screws', 'succeeded', 'getting', 'favorable', 'judgement', 'tune', 'millions', 'dollars.And', 'so', 'little', 'guy', 'win', 'much', 'more', 'often', 'Goliaths', 'world', 'just', 'grind', 'Davids', 'dirt']",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS

Gittins,"[42, 44]","This 1988 movie, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by George Lucas, has good acting from Jeff Bridges, Martin Landau, Frederic Forrest, and Joan Allen in the larger roles. Smaller supporting roles were also handled well by Christian Slater, Jay O. Sanders, Nina Siemaszko and Mako.As reflected by the DVD cover, the movie is filmed in a splashy 1940's advertising style, and uses warm gold and sepia tones and some impressive camera work to tell the tale of the development of the ""Tucker 48"" automobile, also known as the ""Torpedo"" after its sleek lines (for the times), of which only about 50 were made. For its time, it had many innovative features, including a rear-mounted engine, seat belts and padded dash, push button controls, and a third central headlight that would turn when steering. The large, 4,800 pound behemoth got about 20 MPH.In a somewhat dichotomous framework, the movie shows the result of American ""Yankee ingenuity"" coupled with the eventual demise of the Tucker due to pressure by the Big Three automaking competitors. Taken to court for fraud with the accusation that he would not deliver on the promise of producing a car, Tucker in fact is found not guilty, and had actually produced about 50 cars, though his business was effective ruined.Tucker had other successes however. Just before World War II, he developed an armored car that was so fast at 80-plus MPH, the Army did not want it because they thought such vehicles should only go about 35 MPH. However, the rotating gun-turret used on top of the vehicle, the ""Tucker turret"", was used on American bombers, such as the B-17 and B-24, thoughout the war.Although his business partner Abe Karatz (Landau) is quite upset that the car business folded, Tucker tells him...""It's the idea that counts, Abe, and the dream."" Tucker died in 1956 from lung cancer at age 53.The reasonably-priced DVD has the wide-screen movie, an excellent original 15-minute long 1948 promotional film made by the Tucker company (with or without commentary by FFC), a mediocre short ""making of"" collection of cast/crew interview clips mostly from 1988, a decent commentary by FFC, and the usual setup features.",5,"""It's the idea that counts, and the dream.""",1086998400,"06 12, 2004",2004,2180,"['1988', 'movie', 'directed', 'Francis', 'Ford', 'Coppola', 'produced', 'George', 'Lucas', 'good', 'acting', 'Jeff', 'Bridges', 'Martin', 'Landau', 'Frederic', 'Forrest', 'Joan', 'Allen', 'larger', 'roles', 'Smaller', 'supporting', 'roles', 'were', 'also', 'handled', 'well', 'Christian', 'Slater', 'Jay', 'O.', 'Sanders', 'Nina', 'Siemaszko', 'Mako.As', 'reflected', 'DVD', 'cover', 'movie', 'filmed', 'splashy', '1940', 'advertising', 'style', 'warm', 'gold', 'sepia', 'tones', 'impressive', 'camera', 'work', 'tell', 'tale', 'development', 'Tucker', '48', 'automobile', 'also', 'known', 'Torpedo', 'sleek', 'lines', 'times', 'only', '50', 'were', 'made', 'time', 'had', 'many', 'innovative', 'features', 'including', 'rear-mounted', 'engine', 'seat', 'belts', 'padded', 'dash', 'push', 'button', 'controls', 'third', 'central', 'headlight', 'would', 'turn', 'when', 'steering', 'large', '4,800', 'pound', 'got', 'about', '20', 'MPH.In', 'somewhat', 'dichotomous', 'framework', 'movie', 'result', 'American', 'Yankee', 'ingenuity', 'coupled', 'eventual', 'demise', 'Tucker', 'due', 'pressure', 'Big', 'Three', 'automaking', 'competitors', 'Taken', 'court', 'fraud', 'accusation', 'would', 'not', 'deliver', 'promise', 'producing', 'car', 'Tucker', 'fact', 'found', 'not', 'guilty', 'had', 'actually', 'produced', '50', 'cars', 'business', 'was', 'effective', 'ruined.Tucker', 'had', 'other', 'successes', 'however', 'Just', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'developed', 'armored', 'car', 'was', 'so', 'fast', '80-plus', 'MPH', 'Army', 'did', 'not', 'want', 'thought', 'such', 'vehicles', 'should', 'only', 'go', 'about', '35', 'MPH', 'However', 'rotating', 'gun-turret', 'used', 'top', 'vehicle', 'Tucker', 'turret', 'was', 'used', 'American', 'bombers', 'such', 'B-17', 'B-24', 'war.Although', 'business', 'partner', 'Abe', 'Karatz', 'Landau', 'quite', 'upset', 'car', 'business', 'folded', 'Tucker', 'idea', 'Abe', 'dream', 'Tucker', 'died', '1956', 'lung', 'cancer', 'age', '53.The', 'reasonably-priced', 'DVD', 'wide-screen', 'movie', 'excellent', 'original', '15-minute', 'long', '1948', 'promotional', 'film', 'made', 'Tucker', 'company', 'commentary', 'FFC', 'mediocre', 'short', 'making', 'collection', 'cast/crew', 'interview', 'clips', 'mostly', '1988', 'decent', 'commentary', 'FFC', 'usual', 'setup', 'features']",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS
247056,A3MLO4GAD2O9DL,6301217861,"LGwriter ""SharpWitGuy""","[4, 4]","The tragedy of Preston Tucker is that of a visionary who saw all the way back in the late 1940s what really needed to be done with the automobile--e.g., seat belts, fuel injection, disk brakes--and then did it and then got completely destroyed by the powers that be because of it. In this context, ""powers that be"" means not only the big 3 automakers (GM, Ford, and Chrysler at the time) but the Feds as well.It's the same old story. Watch the  documentary ""The Corporation"" for an updated version of how US big business continues to destroy what's good and true and real, just like it did to Tucker.The film is somewhat glossed over, but the production is absolutely smashing. It's a period piece and the period is evoked so well that the viewer is completely caught up in the events. Tucker envisioned a car so far ahead of its time that the stodgy, rod-up-their-butts, too stupid for their own good politicos and corporate blowhards couldn't handle it and subsequently used every means at their  disposal to bring Tucker down.Jeff Bridges gives a wide-eyed interpretation of Preston Tucker, which is not a bad thing, and Joan Allen--as usual--turns in an excellent performance as his supportive wife. The supporting cast is fine, with Frederic Forrest, Mako, Elias Koteas, and Christian Slater as the standouts.This is more than anything else a political film and it's no secret where the director's (Francis Ford Coppola) sympathies lie, as do mine. It's a real shame the Tucker could not be mass produced. But we do have this fine film and, as well, an interesting  article in the August 2006 issue of Life Extension magazine on Preston Tucker.This is how government and big business collude--both in the late 1940s and now.

At the time of the investigation, Tucker had hired over 1,900 employees. The car's original proposed price was about $2,500, but ended up closer to $4,000. Current value is about $1.5 million.Tucker's design called for a water-cooled aluminum rear engine, disc brakes, all-around independent suspension, fuel injection, windows that would pop out in the event of a crash, and padding for safety. It also had a directional third headlight that would light  the path around corners. Engine and transmission were mounted on a separate sub-frame secured with only six bolts, enabling it to be removed and replaced with a loaner engine in 30 minutes. The disc brakes, fuel injection, self-sealing tubeless tires, hydraulic-operated valves, and direct-drive torque converter transmission were all dropped because of cost and lack of time to develop.My only question - I'm really not certain why the firm closed.",5,Far More Realistic Than I Expected -,1385424000,"11 26, 2013",2013,1415,"['Tucker', 'early', 'auto', 'experience', 'came', 'working', 'Ford', 'assembly', 'line', 'developing', 'making', 'Indy', 'race', 'cars', 'creating', ""'Tucker"", 'Tiger', 'armored', 'combat', 'carThe', 'Tucker', 'car', 'was', 'conceived', 'Preston', 'Tucker', 'briefly', 'produced', 'only', '51', 'made', '1948', 'Chicago', 'company', 'folded', 'early', 'March', '1949', 'due', 'negative', 'publicity', 'SEC', 'investigation', 'heavily', 'publicized', 'stock', 'fraud', 'trail', 'reportedly', 'motivated', 'sensitivity', 'prior', 'fraud', 'Kaiser-Frazer', 'Tucker', 'was', 'acquitted', 'charges', 'time', 'investigation', 'Tucker', 'had', 'hired', '1,900', 'employees', 'car', 'original', 'proposed', 'price', 'was', '2,500', 'ended', 'up', 'closer', '4,000', 'Current', 'value', '1.5', 'million.Tucker', 'design', 'called', 'water-cooled', 'aluminum', 'rear', 'engine', 'disc', 'brakes', 'all-around', 'independent', 'suspension', 'fuel', 'injection', 'would', 'pop', 'out', 'event', 'crash', 'padding', 'safety', 'also', 'had', 'directional', 'third', 'headlight', 'would', 'light', 'path', 'corners', 'Engine', 'transmission', 'were', 'mounted', 'separate', 'sub-frame', 'secured', 'only', 'six', 'bolts', 'enabling', 'be', 'removed', 'replaced', 'loaner', 'engine', '30', 'minutes', 'disc', 'brakes', 'fuel', 'injection', 'self-sealing', 'tubeless', 'tires', 'hydraulic-operated', 'valves', 'direct-drive', 'torque', 'converter', 'transmission', 'were', 'dropped', 'cost', 'lack', 'time', 'develop.My', 'only', 'question', ""'m"", 'really', 'not', 'certain', 'why', 'firm', 'closed']",Tucker--The Man and His Dream VHS

Preston Tucker, as portrayed by the film, courageously tries (and fails) to defy big business and big politics to follow his dream of building a gorgeous, brilliantly engineered, truly revolutionary car.  He's a modern Howard Roark, not bothered by what others think, attacking any obstacle put in his way, pursuing his own ideas at any cost.  There's a great deal of truth to the auto industry colluding with politicians to squash him rather than fairly compete with him.  I'm suspicious though, that the true motives of he and his business partner, a convicted bank defrauder (deftly played by Martin Landau) to sell stock and dealerships, was underplayed by the film to maintain Preston as hero.

This movie is the perfect example of what Adam Smith (Author of: The Wealth Of Nations, 1776) warned his readers of: when companies become too big they inevitably dominate public policies for their own self interest while disregarding the cost to technological and productive progress.The movie tells the story of determined dreamer and self made entrepreneur, Preston Tucker. After world war II Tucker conceptualized a futuristic car built for safety, class, and longevity. He envisioned a car with all-wheel disc brakes for better stopping power, fuel injection for more horse power and better fuel efficiency, as well as: seat belts, safety glass, and a roll bar for passenger protection. He wanted to revolutionize the auto industry and put the focus back squarely on the consumer while driving technology forward. He thought outside the box and tested tradition with novel ideas: engine in the rear, independent spring-less suspension, and a third headlight that follows the steering wheel. Almost all these innovations are common (if not standard) features found on vehicles today.The film shows how Tucker basically made the Big Three look like fools by practically utilizing ordinary and present day technology, circa 1946, to build an extraordinary and superior automobile. In all actuality, all Preston did was efficiently use what was already commercially available and built a car that was as strong and as safe as any could and should be. All concepts that the Big Three either failed to notice or intentionally ignored.Some people still question whether or not Mr.Tucker was really going to build the car. Well, if raising $17 million in capital to secure leasing the largest production facility ever created, rescuing the engine supplier from certain bankruptcy with his own finances, and hiring over 1900 employees to engineer, assemble, and deliver his product still leaves you wondering if this Preston Tucker was a crook bent on bamboozling the public for a quick buck, maybe you should re-evaluate your own motives in life. With a little research and mental capacity, anyone can figure out this guy had a dream he wanted to make a reality and his only intention was to profit off his idea while offering the consumer something of quality and benefit.In conclusion I highly recommend this movie to any dreamer, businessman, historian, independent spirit, or free thinking individual.

Jeff Bridges plays the title role with such energy and enthusiasm that you end up thinking this guy could conquer the world.  Joan Allen is her usual excellent self as Preston's devoted wife, and Martin Landau is brilliant in his Oscar-nominated role as Tucker's somewhat skeptical business partner.  Christian Slater, in one of his earliest screen appearances, plays Tucker's oldest son.  Although they are on screen together for only a brief period of time in the picture, it is wonderful to see Jeff Bridges with his father, the late great Lloyd Bridges.  The elder Bridges plays Homer Ferguson, a U.S. Senator from Michigan who instigated a probe and subsequent prosecution of Tucker by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly defrauding investors (Tucker was eventually exonerated after his company folded due to the negative publicity).All of the acting performances in this picture are superb, and the pacing is almost frenetic.  These factors, along with a rather ingenious use of transitions by Director Francis Ford Coppola (who coincidentally owns one of the few Tuckers left in existence), create a busy feeling that conveys to the audience that Tucker has got the world by the tail and is pulling hard...hold that tiger!  Combine all of this with an excellent soundtrack by Joe Jackson (unfortunately very hard to find these days), and you have what one reviewer accurately describes as one of the greatest movies that hardly anyone ever watched.

247097,A2KVUYPLEW4LXT,6301217861,"Strategos ""The Guardian of Time""","[3, 3]","I'm a fan of George Lucas, and somewhat of Francis Ford Coppola (but not for the same reasons as most). Way back before George Lucas and FFC were famous, they were friends and film students full of youthful idealism. And when that idealism shines through, you get great movies. Movies like Finian's Rainbow and American Graffiti. While people still remember Steven Spielberg's early films like Jaws, E.T., and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and side movies between blockbusters like The Terminal and Catch Me If You Can (Oscar nominations help) people tend to forget anything that FFC and George Lucas worked on other than Star Wars and The Godfather. That's a crying shame...because in among the other projects are films like this...one of the most delightful, well-made, well-acted, and overall SUPERB films ever made.The Cinema of George LucasThe film may have been directed by FFC but it has George Lucas written all over it (Executive Producer and his production company LucasFilm was used for this film). He loved classic cars and the feel of the United States before it became all about big corporations and all of the heart and soul was squashed out of the little men with big dreams who built the country (Lucas always viewed himself as the little guy fighting the big bad corporations).Some might immediately think George Lucas would ruin a movie like this, but when teamed up with FFC, it comes across as the very best of both film makers. True, there's a slight...coolness to the film style (as opposed to warmth) that's reminiscent of Indiana Jones, Star Wars, ect. But here it's far more stylish than aloof (as opposed to say...the Phantom Menace). You CLEARLY see Lucas' style of film-making influencing the film throughout from the film composition to the overall indefinable FEEL of the film (almost as if he was standing behind FFC the whole time making suggestions for how to make the film).Francis Ford CopolaTo be sure, Francis Ford Coppola deserves full credit for a textbook perfect job directing this film. When I watched the film and listened to the excellent commentary his idealism and child-like love of film-making and the subject of the film can't help but shine through, and you can see how that spirit that pervades the film saved it from being a downer film about a failed man and instead turned it into a great story about the great automotive company that almost was a great American enterprise (and instead was just a great attempt).On to the film....To be sure, this movie is just about perfect. It's got drama (from a car nearly falling on one of the engineers while building the prototype to the courtroom defense of the auto company's behavior), comedy (serving rare beef to government officials while showing a slideshow of auto fatalities that resulted from not wearing seatbelts), family togetherness (the son telling the father he wants to be like him), and tear-jerker moments (when their investor tells Tucker with tears in his eyes for the first time in his life he is ashamed because Tucker's kids will know he served prison time). The film is a breezy 110 minutes that passes like an hour and half, and never stops entertaining you until the credits finish rolling.The ActorsWe have Jeff Bridges as the title character Tucker, Christian Slater as his son (this movie started my Christian Slater obsession), the legendary Mako as one of his engineers (Uncle Iroh from Avatar:The Last Air Bender), Lloyd Bridges as a corrupt politician out to destroy Tucker, and Martin Landau as his investor/business partner in a role that SHOULD have won him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Everyone in this film is great but those are the stand-outs. Perfect, perfect, perfect.The soundThe sound for this film has the awesome rock solid sound of a high budget film that Lucas' Skywalker Sound worked on (despite being a more low-key film) and hence has flawless sound production and a fun soundtrack (that had me start yelling ""Hold that Tiger!!!"" for weeks).The PictureThis is a BEAUTIFUL film that's expertly shot and uses every film trick for slick visual effect (split walls for phone calls ect) but never over-uses said tricks. It's a good DVD but this film deserves better. It really needs s digital restoration and a special edition Blu Ray (I'd pay good money for that).The HistoryEven more amazing than everything else is the fact that this is a true story. As I was watching it I will never forget the scene where Tucker visits Howard Hughes in person for help with a problem (caused by the Big Three auto makers and corrupt politicians). After seeing The Aviator it felt amazing to have a gap in my knowledge of American History filled in, and see how multiple independent business men had to fight and claw for justice in a corrupt system that favored the rich and powerful. Strong stuff.OverallI was told about this movie when I was in my early teens by a friend who introduced me to Kurosawa, John Ford, Orson Wells, and great film-making in general. I rented it on Netflix one day years later when it caught my eye. It's one of the most under-rated films of all time (in my humble opinion). If you love Americana, history, Jeff Bridges, the 80's, George Lucas, or even just good movies, you deserve to see this movie. If you're anything like me it will become one of your all-time favorite movies. It's fun, engaging, superbly made, and just plain enjoyable classic film-making at its best. HIGHLY recommended.This review is dedicated to Mako 1933-2006.",5,"""Don't get too close to people.

I'm surprised it didn't make it to the silver screen before this film (1988).  Jeff Bridges did a fine job of imparting Tucker's spirit of never letting problems and failure discourage him from following his dream.
