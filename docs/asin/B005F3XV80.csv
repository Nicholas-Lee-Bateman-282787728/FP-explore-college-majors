There is a brand-new flavor and equally original story to this movie as the original.  Doris Roberts continues to just be herself to make the grandmotherly, crafty, supernatural (but only we, the viewers, know it) character known as &#34;Mrs. Miracle&#34; shine.  The casting feels just as authentic as in the original.  Those 3 factors--the story, Doris Roberts' role as Mrs. Miracle, and the rest of the cast--are what made the first one a 5-star movie for me.  This, the sequel, has the same director, Michael Scott.  The male and female leads, Jewel Staite and Eric Johnson, have excellent chemistry together.  Rather unusually, there are almost no problems in their developing romance, every issue revolving around their families and jobs.  There are lots of laughs and lots of unexpected plot twists in this one, and I think it has more humor than the first--and it's not just from the manipulations of Mrs. Miracle this time.  The last quarter of the movie brings resolution to every plot strand in really brilliant and touching ways.  I also strongly appreciate that it embraces Jesus as the source of Christmas, which no one ought to be ashamed of, and this film isn't ashamed of.

While the second movie is not as well done as ""Mrs. Miracle"" which featured the hyper-active twins and two adults searching for happiness, I was still glad to see Mrs. Miracle once again in a sweet story of an over-worked aunt and a department store heir apparent during the Christmas season. The film has a high sugar content but is still fun to watch during the holidays. The problem is that the producer opens with at least six or seven previews, each of which runs from two to five minutes. So, the customer pays for ""Call Me Mrs. Miracle"" but is forced to sit through at least 20 minutes or more of previews of other movies that are in no way related to Mrs. Miracle or even Christmas films. To add to this annoying time wasting preview overload, there is no menu available to bypass the preview commercials until AFTER the viewer is forced to sit through all the previews. Alas, this annoying overload of previews takes the bloom off the rose of the Mrs. Miracle feature and leaves the viewer feeling like Scrooge. I did not pay for 20 minutes or more of commercials. I paid for a movie and I am disappointed that fast forward for each separate preview is the only way to finally arrive at a menu that leads to PLAY the feature.

She is a marketing assistant to a very egocentric fashion designer. Though always well-meaning, Holly appears at times to be a bit ditzy, often saying the wrong things and tripping over herself to try and correct her errors. Between her demanding job and the needs of her nephew, she doesn't really have time to date.Enter Jake, a department store manager who, strangely enough, keeps crossing paths with her. Somehow his mysteriously appearing new store employee, Mrs Merkle (whose nametag erroneously reads Mrs. Miracle) just seems to have a sense of what people need--whether it is a recommendation for a good place to eat, or a plug for a new promotion on the nightly news. There is always a little magic in the air to match the twinkle in her eye as she goes about nudging people to take chances, or to see their situation in a new light.Everyone needs a little help from her. Holly feels like she has let Gabe and her brother down by not being as attentive to Gabe as she feels she should have been. Jake feels like he has let his father down because he chose not to stock the latest electronic toy in their store and now sales are way down at a critical time and Jake's job is on the line. Jake's father needs help getting past the fact that his wife died 20 years ago on Christmas Eve. He hasn't celebrated the holiday since then, and hasn't held the company Christmas party, either. And Gabe badly misses his Dad and his friends. On top of that, he wants the latest electronic toy for Christmas and his Aunt Holly can't get her hands on one.Doris Roberts is endearing once again in her role as Mrs. Merkle, and thankfully, in this second of the ""Mrs. Miracle"" movies, someone had the presence of mind to fix the lipstick disaster from the first movie and you don't have to be distracted by the bad paint job whenever she is on camera. (Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest. If you saw the first movie you know of what I speak.) Mrs. Miracle is ever the optimist and she always seems to be right.In the end there is a rather poignant scene involving a toy train, a father and son, and a soldier home on leave.This is a Christmas flick with just a hint of fantasy. The romance is a gentle thread through the movie and the conflicts are not earth-shattering ones.

She says it is a mistake, but she likes the name & doesn't want to change it...especially since It's almost Christmas.  Holly takes Gabe shopping after work.  Of course, they end up in the Toy Department at Finley's where once again she runs into Jake.  Mrs Miracle always seems to be in the right place at the right time with the right nudge...pushing people to take chances.  There is an air of mystery surrounding Mrs Miracle.  She seems to always know what people need & just how to help them find it.  Gabe becomes attached to Mrs Miracle as do Holly, Jake, & Jake's Dad.Jake's Dad is a very sad & lonely man.  His wife had died on Christmas Eve 20 years before & he had stopped celebrating Christmas because he felt it dishonored the memory of his beloved wife.  He used to give wonderful Christmas parties for his employees; but that stopped after his wife's passing.  He kept himself locked away in his office growing even more bitter by the moment.  He had received numerous Christmas cards, but refused to open them...instead choosing to throw them away.  The cards just refused to go away showing back up in his briefcase, his pocket, on his desk, etc.Jake believed strongly that old fashioned Christmases were the best Christmases!!!  The popular toy of the season was the electronic Intellytron.  Every child (including Gabe) wanted one for Christmas, but Jake made the decision that quality constructed toys that challenged a child's imagination were more important than the electronic in-toy & he refused to stock even one.  His Dad felt Jake had made a very unwise decision as the annual profits for the store were mostly from Christmas sales.  Jake assured his Dad that if he were wrong that he'd resign from his job.  His Dad assured him that when he could prove that Jake was wrong that he'd accept his resignation.  Mrs Miracle made sure to put her positive spin on every discussion he had with Jake's Dad even when it was obvious that their toys just were not selling!!!  As Christmas nears, it is discovered that the Intellytron is a fire hazard as it tends to burst into flames as the children played with it.  The manufacturer wisely offers everybody their money back.  Finley's Department Store is the ONLY store in town that doesn't carry the Intellytron & the local news points this out to their viewers.  Mrs Miracle is interviewed by the local news & she gives credit to her boss Jake as having the fore-site to believe that children should be challenged to use their imagination instead of just playing with electronic toys.  She also announces that her boss had planned on donating a portion of all proceeds to the children of military families so they will not be left out during the holidays.  Of course, the very next morning Finley's was packed with people buying quality toys to enhance their child's imagination & also to support our troops!!!The love story of Jake & Holly is gently interwoven into the quiet fantasy of a beautiful Christmas story.  Not wanting to create a major spoiler...just let me say that you need to watch this movie to warn the cockles of your heart!!!  This is one of those movies that makes you laugh, cry & brings back all those warm memories of your own childhood Christmases...well worth watching!!!",5,GREAT Heartfelt Christmas Movie...Kleenex REQUIRED Ladies!!!,1318636800,"10 15, 2011",2011,4283,"['Gabe', 'Mom', 'passed', 'away', 'when', 'was', 'young', 'was', 'just', 'Dad', 'Then', 'Dad', 'who', 'military', 'deployed', 'overseas', 'Gabe', 'left', 'custody', 'Dad', 'single', 'sister', 'Holly', 'who', 'absolutely', 'NO', 'idea', 'how', 'relate', 'children', 'Being', 'single', 'devoted', 'career', 'outrageous', 'hours', 'even', 'more', 'difficult', 'Gabe', 'Aunt', 'Holly', 'bond', 'Holly', 'Marketing', 'Assistant', 'fashion', 'designer', 'who', 'own', 'little', 'offbeat', 'world', 'Stopping', 'pick', 'up', 'boss', 'cup', 'coffee', 'Holly', 'accidentally', 'Jake', 'Finley', 'sparks', 'fly', 'demanding', 'job', 'desire', 'be', 'BEST', 'Aunt', 'can', 'be', 'Holly', ""n't"", 'have', 'time', 'date', 'Still', 'drawn', 'Jake.Jake', 'son', 'owner', 'Finley', 'Department', 'Store', 'manager', 'Toy', 'Department', 'Jake', 'work', 'meeting', 'Holly', 'pleased', 'meet', 'new', 'Toy', 'Department', 'employee', 'Mrs', 'Mirkle', 'who', 'saturated', 'Christmas', 'spirit', 'Mrs', 'Mirkle', 'name', 'tag', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'mistake', 'name', ""n't"", 'want', 'change', 'especially', 'almost', 'Christmas', 'Holly', 'Gabe', 'shopping', 'work', 'course', 'end', 'up', 'Toy', 'Department', 'Finley', 'where', 'once', 'again', 'Jake', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'always', 'be', 'right', 'place', 'right', 'time', 'right', 'nudge', 'pushing', 'people', 'take', 'chances', 'air', 'mystery', 'surrounding', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'always', 'know', 'what', 'people', 'need', 'just', 'how', 'help', 'find', 'Gabe', 'attached', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'do', 'Holly', 'Jake', 'Jake', 'Dad.Jake', 'Dad', 'very', 'sad', 'lonely', 'man', 'wife', 'had', 'died', 'Christmas', 'Eve', '20', 'years', 'had', 'stopped', 'celebrating', 'Christmas', 'felt', 'dishonored', 'memory', 'beloved', 'wife', 'used', 'give', 'wonderful', 'Christmas', 'parties', 'employees', 'stopped', 'wife', 'passing', 'kept', 'locked', 'away', 'office', 'growing', 'even', 'more', 'bitter', 'moment', 'had', 'received', 'numerous', 'Christmas', 'cards', 'refused', 'open', 'instead', 'choosing', 'throw', 'away', 'cards', 'just', 'refused', 'go', 'away', 'showing', 'back', 'up', 'briefcase', 'pocket', 'desk', 'etc.Jake', 'believed', 'strongly', 'old', 'fashioned', 'Christmases', 'were', 'best', 'Christmases', 'popular', 'toy', 'season', 'was', 'electronic', 'Intellytron', 'Every', 'child', 'including', 'Gabe', 'wanted', 'one', 'Christmas', 'Jake', 'made', 'decision', 'quality', 'constructed', 'toys', 'challenged', 'child', 'imagination', 'were', 'more', 'important', 'electronic', 'in-toy', 'refused', 'stock', 'even', 'one', 'Dad', 'felt', 'Jake', 'had', 'made', 'very', 'unwise', 'decision', 'annual', 'profits', 'store', 'were', 'mostly', 'Christmas', 'sales', 'Jake', 'assured', 'Dad', 'were', 'wrong', ""'d"", 'resign', 'job', 'Dad', 'assured', 'when', 'could', 'prove', 'Jake', 'was', 'wrong', ""'d"", 'accept', 'resignation', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'made', 'sure', 'put', 'positive', 'spin', 'discussion', 'had', 'Jake', 'Dad', 'even', 'when', 'was', 'obvious', 'toys', 'just', 'were', 'not', 'selling', 'Christmas', 'discovered', 'Intellytron', 'fire', 'hazard', 'burst', 'flames', 'children', 'played', 'manufacturer', 'wisely', 'everybody', 'money', 'back', 'Finley', 'Department', 'Store', 'ONLY', 'store', 'town', ""n't"", 'carry', 'Intellytron', 'local', 'news', 'points', 'viewers', 'Mrs', 'Miracle', 'interviewed', 'local', 'news', 'credit', 'boss', 'Jake', 'having', 'fore-site', 'believe', 'children', 'should', 'be', 'challenged', 'use', 'imagination', 'instead', 'just', 'playing', 'electronic', 'toys', 'also', 'boss', 'had', 'planned', 'donating', 'portion', 'proceeds', 'children', 'military', 'families', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'left', 'out', 'holidays', 'course', 'very', 'next', 'morning', 'Finley', 'was', 'packed', 'people', 'buying', 'quality', 'toys', 'enhance', 'child', 'imagination', 'also', 'support', 'troops', 'love', 'story', 'Jake', 'Holly', 'gently', 'interwoven', 'quiet', 'fantasy', 'beautiful', 'Christmas', 'story', 'Not', 'wanting', 'create', 'major', 'spoiler', 'just', 'let', 'say', 'need', 'watch', 'movie', 'warn', 'cockles', 'heart', 'one', 'movies', 'cry', 'back', 'warm', 'memories', 'own', 'childhood', 'Christmases', 'well', 'watching']",Call Me Mrs. Miracle

The question is whether we enjoy the ride. For me, this film fell flat, though. Doris Roberts is wonderful in the title role, but even she seems limited by a script that doesn't quite pull off the charm of the book (itself predictable). There are some significant changes from the book, one for the better (the big-dollar toy plays a dramatically different role in the film) and some for the worse (a subplot involving the boy and his aunt's boss is missing). For those who have not read the book, of course, these changes mean nothing. So for the film itself, things just felt too forced.
