He picked subjects that we identified with (animals & pets, parental decisions that didn't take the kids feelings into consideration, etc.)and gave them the storytelling that would make us feel good at the end. He did this over and over with his animation and kept it going when he got into live action film. You have to realize that in the 'old days' of live-action movie making, they didn't have all the digital special effects that we have today - so the animals needed to actually be trained (and extremely well trained at that!) and the crew had to work hard at making any confrontation scenes look realistic. The time spent on location doing multiple shots to get just the right combination of actions or animal expressions surely must have been extensive!Watching this movie today it will seem tame and 'simple' compared to the computer-generated extravaganzas that we have come to expect (like Beverly Hills Chihuahua or Underdog)but I would resist using this film as a 'babysitting movie' to keep the kids occupied while you do something else.

It was made into a wonderful movie by Disney studios where the film is mostly narrated with some dialogue between the people involved.Later another version was made where the animals ""talk"".  I've only seen clips of this version, and, maybe for some it is entertaining, but for me it takes away from the touching nature of this story.  By having the animals ""talk"", it makes it more of a charicature of the story and takes away from the seriousness of the plight of these animals.I was hoping that the original would be put out on DVD eventually, and it was!  This is a timeless classic; a real family movie.  Of course, kids younger than six or so may not have the attention span for it - these Disney movies were never intended for toddlers; when they were made, movies were only seen in theaters and children under school age weren't taken to theaters.Be prepared to have a hanky or two at the end...it's a very moving story, and extremely well photographed showing a lot of beautiful terrain.

It is rare that they do that in this age of dysfunctional families and kids with attitude to others. Somewhere along the line they got the idea that kids think this makes them look cool.

During most of the film, there is almost no dialogue except for a boring narration of the story by Rex Allen. I liked the remake, 1993's &quot;Homeward Bound&quot;, much better because it had human actors doing the voices of the animals. They gave the story a lot more spark, spice, action, and adventure, as well as a lot of humor. I believe that an adventure story with animals needs a lot of action and humor, especially in the case of &quot;The Incredible Journey&quot;. Unfortunately, this 1963 Disney adventure has virtually no action or humor or even adventure; it's pretty much an extended version of Walt Disney's True-Life nature documentaries he made during the 1950's.",2,One of the more boring Disney films I've ever seen.,1072742400,"12 30, 2003",2003,810,"['am', 'big', 'Disney', 'film', 'fan', 'animated', 'live-action', 'film', '1963', 'quot', 'Incredible', 'Journey', 'quot', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'cut', 'most', 'film', 'almost', 'dialogue', 'boring', 'narration', 'story', 'Rex', 'Allen', 'liked', 'remake', '1993', 'quot', 'Homeward', 'Bound', 'quot', 'much', 'better', 'had', 'human', 'actors', 'doing', 'voices', 'animals', 'gave', 'story', 'lot', 'more', 'spark', 'spice', 'action', 'adventure', 'as', 'well', 'lot', 'humor', 'believe', 'adventure', 'story', 'animals', 'lot', 'action', 'humor', 'especially', 'case', 'quot', 'Incredible', 'Journey', 'quot', 'Unfortunately', '1963', 'Disney', 'adventure', 'virtually', 'action', 'humor', 'even', 'adventure', 'pretty', 'much', 'extended', 'version', 'Walt', 'Disney', 'True-Life', 'nature', 'documentaries', 'made', '1950']",Incredible Journey VHS
