But this DVD release is by no means a &quot;special edition&quot;, a term that is used loosely today to sell more DVD's. That is why I deducted a star. There is a half hour making of wich is interesting, but I wish they would have done more. There is only one deleted scene, and although it is unique and interesting due to the fact that the ghosts were never digitally added, they could have shown more. Then there are little kids games and a classic Casper cartoon. They could have put more of the cartoons on. As far as the actual movie goes, the picture is crisp and the 5.1 mix is decent.

763589,A2ELT9NS0Q8W9L,B0000AK7A8,babydoh,"[3, 6]","Casper (not to be confused with ""Casper: A Spirited Beginning"" or any of the Casper The Friendly Ghost cartoons) is an interesting mix of elements both good and bad - but mostly good.Without a doubt, the movie's strongest asset is its humor.  By and large, this is thanks to Casper's uncles Stretch, Stinkie, and Fatso (The Ghostly Trio), all of whom are hilariously animated and perfectly voiced by three actors whose names I unfortunately can't remember.  Bill Pullman is also very funny as Dr. Harvey, and great supporting comic performances are lent by Cathy Moriarty as the evil Carrigan Crittenden and Eric Idle as Carrigan's long-suffering sidekick, Dibs.All of this, of course, amounts to a sub-plot in the end - a prominent one, but a sub-plot nonetheless.  The main story is that of Casper (voiced by Malachi Pearson) and Dr. Harvey's young daughter, Kat (Christina Ricci).  Ricci says some of her lines awkwardly (in my opinion), but for the most part does a nice job.  Jessica Wesson's portrayal of Amber, the snotty girl at Kat's school, is perfect.I think the movie's flaws lie in its plot more than anything else.  For instance: throughout the story, Kat has a crush on Vic, the supposedly cute (and slimy) kid at her school, but in the end when Vic shows his true colors and stands her up at the Halloween party, she doesn't really seem to care at all.  There is a brief shot of her sitting by the wall with a pouty (well, really, more broody) expression on her face, but this is dispensed with in an instant.Another of my biggest beefs is with the ending.  I don't want to give away specifics, but it is the weakest part of the story - bittersweet and touching one moment, and then it turns raucous and weird before you can blink.  Makes you want to throttle the nearest neck.Ah, well.  As I said earlier, the movie is far more good than bad, and of course everything here is just one person's opinion.  Who knows.  You might love the ending.  But if not, I have a feeling you'll like most everything else.",4,"A ""Spirited"" Movie (yuk yuk); a ""Poor"" ending",1072396800,"12 26, 2003",2003,2023,"['Casper', 'not', 'be', 'confused', 'Casper', 'Spirited', 'Beginning', 'Casper', 'Friendly', 'Ghost', 'cartoons', 'interesting', 'mix', 'elements', 'good', 'bad', 'mostly', 'doubt', 'movie', 'strongest', 'asset', 'humor', 'large', 'thanks', 'Casper', 'uncles', 'Stretch', 'Stinkie', 'Fatso', 'Ghostly', 'Trio', 'whom', 'are', 'hilariously', 'animated', 'perfectly', 'voiced', 'three', 'actors', 'names', 'unfortunately', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'also', 'very', 'funny', 'Dr.', 'Harvey', 'great', 'supporting', 'comic', 'performances', 'are', 'lent', 'Cathy', 'Moriarty', 'evil', 'Carrigan', 'Crittenden', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Carrigan', 'long-suffering', 'sidekick', 'Dibs.All', 'course', 'sub-plot', 'end', 'prominent', 'one', 'sub-plot', 'nonetheless', 'main', 'story', 'Casper', 'voiced', 'Malachi', 'Pearson', 'Dr.', 'Harvey', 'young', 'daughter', 'Kat', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'Ricci', 'lines', 'awkwardly', 'opinion', 'most', 'part', 'nice', 'job', 'Jessica', 'Wesson', 'portrayal', 'Amber', 'snotty', 'girl', 'Kat', 'school', 'perfect.I', 'think', 'movie', 'flaws', 'lie', 'plot', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'instance', 'story', 'Kat', 'crush', 'Vic', 'supposedly', 'cute', 'slimy', 'kid', 'school', 'end', 'when', 'Vic', 'true', 'colors', 'up', 'Halloween', 'party', ""n't"", 'really', 'seem', 'care', 'brief', 'shot', 'sitting', 'wall', 'pouty', 'well', 'really', 'more', 'broody', 'expression', 'face', 'dispensed', 'instant.Another', 'biggest', 'beefs', 'ending', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'give', 'away', 'specifics', 'weakest', 'part', 'story', 'bittersweet', 'touching', 'one', 'moment', 'then', 'raucous', 'weird', 'can', 'blink', 'Makes', 'want', 'throttle', 'nearest', 'neck.Ah', 'well', 'said', 'earlier', 'movie', 'far', 'more', 'good', 'bad', 'course', 'everything', 'here', 'just', 'one', 'person', 'opinion', 'Who', 'might', 'love', 'ending', 'not', 'have', 'feeling', ""'ll"", 'like', 'most', 'everything', 'else']",N/A

It's actually a very entertaining film with a good cast, althought the non-human characters steal the show. I enjoyed watching Casper's uncles Stinkie, Stretch, and Fatso.As far as the story goes, you've got this old abandoned mansion in Maine where Casper lives with his three ""obnoxious"" uncles. Casper is very lonely, and his uncles don't tolerate humans at all. When the former owner leaves the house to his greedy daughter Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty), she comes running in search of a hidden treasure. She and her partner in crime (Eric Idle) don't last long in the house. With some secret from Casper, Carrigan gets in contact with a ghost shrink named Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and invites him to the house. This makes Casper happy because he has a potential new friend in Harvey's daughter Kat (Christina Ricci). From there, there are many subplots that are drawn out well, and you can't help but feel sorry for Casper.Over all, the animation and digital effects were done well, nothing too over the top.

763594,A3N6GAJTEOF4MO,B0000AK7A8,Caleb Williams,"[2, 4]","Casper is a character that has existed in our minds and our hearts for over 70 years in comic strips and cartoons. Finally, in the year 1995 we are treated to our first live action incarnation of this fantastic character. With the help of Christina Ricci and some exceptionally sweet voice acting by Malachi Pearson we are given a highly enjoyable, highly loveable family picture that teaches us an important message of friendship, family and most important of all moving on while still holding onto the memories of the loved ones we have lost.The story focuses around despicable idiots Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) and Dibbs (Eric Idle) and their quest to find the treasure hidden in a rundown old mansion left to Carrigan in her fathers will. The biggest problem facing Carrigan and Dibbs about Whipstaff Manor are the ghosts that inhabit it. Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch are 3 of the 4 ghosts that inhabit the manor and they're not too pleasant to be encountered by. Casper is the 4th ghost and isn't like the other 3, he just wants a friend to play with so he uses Carrigans plan to have ghost psychiatrist James Harvey (Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci) move in.Ricci was about 15 at the time of the making of this and although it wasn't an Oscar winning role, she certainly played the part of the disgruntled teenager well. The character of Casper was exceptionally sweet and not in an overbearing or sickening way as is the case with most movies based around the sweet characters. Luckily that sweetness is covered a lot for the cynical members of society thanks to the obnoxious uncles Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch and the criminal idiocy of Carrigan and Dibbs.This is a film packed with childish clich&eacute;s we have all come to know and love, such as the basics of courtesy and friendship. The usual slapstick humour we come to expect is also there and is helped by the characteristics of the ghostly uncles, Fatso in particular. Although that character may not be very PC today, there's no doubting that at the time the character was simply put in place to be the threatening big character who turned out to be quite laughable. The interractions between Casper and Kat are sometimes flawless and on a personality level is actually quite heart wearming. Some of the interractions thanks to the believable acting of Ricci make you think that she is really talking to a large headed ghost, and he is really making them breakfast.Talking of interractions, the CGI is something to really shout about as for the time this film was made CGI specialised such as this had never been seen before. The interractions between the CG animated ghost and reality are flawless to say the least. Food interraction, communication between the actors and the ghost characters and other general interractions between CGI and reality are truly without flaw.Casper is an enjoyable character and the whole message of passing over in regards to the ghosts is very special indeed. I highly applaud this film for managing to competently put across what some people would consider a sickeningly sweet storyline, and making it an enjoyable experience for the entire family to thoroughly enjoy. One particular part of the film which I loved was the cameo of Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Rodney Dangerfield.I would highly recommend this film and its sequels, although I haven't seen the sequels myself but I'm sure they would be good.",5,A Classic,1232150400,"01 17, 2009",2009,3414,"['Casper', 'character', 'existed', 'minds', 'hearts', '70', 'years', 'comic', 'strips', 'cartoons', 'Finally', 'year', '1995', 'are', 'treated', 'first', 'live', 'action', 'incarnation', 'fantastic', 'character', 'help', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'exceptionally', 'sweet', 'voice', 'acting', 'Malachi', 'Pearson', 'are', 'given', 'highly', 'enjoyable', 'highly', 'loveable', 'family', 'picture', 'important', 'message', 'friendship', 'family', 'most', 'important', 'moving', 'still', 'holding', 'memories', 'loved', 'ones', 'have', 'lost.The', 'story', 'despicable', 'idiots', 'Carrigan', 'Cathy', 'Moriarty', 'Dibbs', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'quest', 'find', 'treasure', 'hidden', 'rundown', 'old', 'mansion', 'left', 'Carrigan', 'fathers', 'will', 'biggest', 'problem', 'facing', 'Carrigan', 'Dibbs', 'Whipstaff', 'Manor', 'are', 'ghosts', 'inhabit', 'Fatso', 'Stinkie', 'Stretch', 'are', '3', '4', 'ghosts', 'inhabit', 'manor', ""'re"", 'not', 'too', 'pleasant', 'be', 'encountered', 'Casper', '4th', 'ghost', ""n't"", 'other', '3', 'just', 'friend', 'play', 'so', 'Carrigans', 'plan', 'have', 'ghost', 'psychiatrist', 'James', 'Harvey', 'Pullman', 'daughter', 'Kat', 'Ricci', 'move', 'in.Ricci', 'was', 'about', '15', 'time', 'making', 'was', ""n't"", 'Oscar', 'winning', 'role', 'certainly', 'played', 'part', 'disgruntled', 'teenager', 'well', 'character', 'Casper', 'was', 'exceptionally', 'sweet', 'not', 'overbearing', 'sickening', 'way', 'case', 'most', 'movies', 'based', 'sweet', 'characters', 'Luckily', 'sweetness', 'covered', 'lot', 'cynical', 'members', 'society', 'thanks', 'obnoxious', 'uncles', 'Fatso', 'Stinkie', 'Stretch', 'criminal', 'idiocy', 'Carrigan', 'Dibbs.This', 'film', 'packed', 'childish', 'clich', 'eacute', 'have', 'come', 'know', 'love', 'such', 'basics', 'courtesy', 'friendship', 'usual', 'slapstick', 'humour', 'come', 'expect', 'also', 'helped', 'characteristics', 'ghostly', 'uncles', 'Fatso', 'particular', 'character', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'very', 'PC', 'today', 'doubting', 'time', 'character', 'was', 'simply', 'put', 'place', 'be', 'threatening', 'big', 'character', 'who', 'turned', 'out', 'be', 'quite', 'laughable', 'interractions', 'Casper', 'Kat', 'are', 'sometimes', 'flawless', 'personality', 'level', 'actually', 'quite', 'heart', 'wearming', 'interractions', 'thanks', 'believable', 'acting', 'Ricci', 'make', 'think', 'really', 'talking', 'large', 'headed', 'ghost', 'really', 'making', 'breakfast.Talking', 'interractions', 'CGI', 'something', 'really', 'shout', 'as', 'time', 'film', 'was', 'made', 'CGI', 'specialised', 'such', 'had', 'never', 'been', 'seen', 'interractions', 'CG', 'animated', 'ghost', 'reality', 'are', 'flawless', 'say', 'least', 'Food', 'interraction', 'communication', 'actors', 'ghost', 'characters', 'other', 'general', 'interractions', 'CGI', 'reality', 'are', 'truly', 'flaw.Casper', 'enjoyable', 'character', 'whole', 'message', 'passing', 'over', 'regards', 'ghosts', 'very', 'special', 'indeed', 'highly', 'applaud', 'film', 'managing', 'competently', 'put', 'across', 'what', 'people', 'would', 'consider', 'sickeningly', 'sweet', 'storyline', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'entire', 'family', 'thoroughly', 'enjoy', 'One', 'particular', 'part', 'film', 'loved', 'was', 'cameo', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'Mel', 'Gibson', 'Rodney', 'Dangerfield.I', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'sequels', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'sequels', ""'m"", 'sure', 'would', 'be', 'good']",N/A

Surprisingly, though, it's actually a very entertaining film that even manages to produce a poignant moment or two in between scenes of regular hilarity.  The fact that Christina Ricci is in the movie doesn't hurt either - that's the main reason I wanted to see it.  The whole cast is actually quite good, even Bill Pullman (who I'm grudgingly beginning to halfway like for some crazy reason - and yes, you do get one of those vintage Pullman turnaround shots before the movie ends).  The non-human characters really steal the show, though, as Casper's uncles Stinkie, Stretch, and Fatso are a real hoot and steal every scene they're in.As far as the story goes, you've got this old abandoned mansion in Maine where Casper lives with his three obnoxious uncles.  Casper is of course quite lonely, and his uncles will not tolerate humans at all.  Then the old dude who owns the condemned place dies and leaves the house to his greedy daughter Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty), who comes running in search of a hidden treasure.  She and her friend/partner in crime (Eric Idle) don't last more than a few seconds in the house.  With a little secret encouragement from Casper, however, Carrigan finds out about a ghost shrink named Dr. James Harvey (Bill Pullman) and invites him to the house.  Casper is overjoyed because he has a potential new friend in Harvey's daughter Kat (Christina Ricci).  There are several little subplots that play out rather well, but it's mainly just a matter of sitting back and letting all the ghostly hi-jinx work their magic.  That's not to say the movie isn't sad at times, as you can't help but feel sorry for poor lonely Casper.I thought the animation and digital effects were done really well; it would have been so easy to go way over the top, but ILM knows what they are doing.  It can't be easy to work with characters you can't even see (except via their stand-ins during filming), but I found the interaction between ghosts and humans to be very natural and believable.  It's really a great family film because kids will surely enjoy all of the ghostly antics, adults will find themselves laughing along more often than not, and the movie definitely has a heart.  You can also have fun spotting all of the many celebrity cameos that pop up all over the place.

Honestly, why don't family movies aim a little higher?  Pixar has proven over and over again that it's possible to make a smart, funny movie that people of all ages can enjoy.  Anyway..I do not own Casper on DVD; I saw it in the theater.  I don't even remember why I went to see this; it was probably a family outing, but I might have gone because I'm a fan of animation.  Bleh.  The ghosts looked lame, the story was full of holes, the characters were shallow & two-dimensional, the acting was mediocre.  The only reason I'm even reviewing this turkey is because of the set design.That's right, I said set design.  I was way more excited by the Casper _house_ than by the foolery that was taking place in it.  The sets were heavily inspired by the work of late-1800s Spanish architect Antoni Gaudi (the organic, spirally ceiling in the girl's bedroom is a direct quote from an apartment building in Barcelona.)  I thought initially the Gaudi references were just a fluke, that they accidentally used his style as a single piece in what was going to be an incoherent Art Nouveau collage ... but every interior shot, every new area of the house looked like a fanciful (but faithful) interpretation of Gaudi's style (except the basement, which didn't match at all.)  I was amazed that somebody took the effort to reference a particular architect and maintain a plausible pastiche of his style throughout.  I had never really paid a lot of attention to movie set design before, but this show was so forgettable that I found it easy to look at the backdrops instead.  Also helps that I knew about Gaudi and was an admirer of his idiosyncratic work long before seeing the movie.Casper's set designer gets five stars, but this lame movie only deserves two.

Unlike many movies concerning ghosts, there is no reason to worry that this movie will upset or scare even the most sensitive children.  Casper is sweet and endearing, and even the vicious ghosts in this film are far from threatening as they quickly bring a smile to your face and alleviate any tension with humor.However, Casper does not rely souly on laughter, and has a strong plot to back it up.  It raises spiritual questions that make you think, and has very heartfelt moments of intense emotion.  You grow to care about the characters as we watch Casper and Kat in their simultaneous search for friendship, and Dr. Harvey in his quest to resolve his own unfinished business and finally get some closure.Malachi Pearson does an outstanding job as the voice of Casper, and portrays all of his emotions very convincingly.  You can also look forward to a great performance from Bill Pullman, and will love hating the bumbling villains portrayed by Cathy Moriarty and Eric Idle.  Unfortunately, there are times where Christina Ricci seems to have some difficulty filling her role as Kat, and occasionally makes scenes awkward and unconvincing.The score for this film is beautiful, and adds a great deal to the spirit and mood of the movie.There is some light use of profanity that I don't find necessary or appropriate for a family film aimed largely at children, but it can be easily overlooked.",4,"A Sweet and Sentimental Comedy, Perfect for the Family",1089590400,"07 12, 2004",2004,1495,"['Casper', 'fun', 'children', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'watched', 'family', 'keep', 'everyone', 'entertained', 'many', 'movies', 'concerning', 'ghosts', 'reason', 'worry', 'movie', 'will', 'upset', 'scare', 'even', 'most', 'sensitive', 'children', 'Casper', 'sweet', 'endearing', 'even', 'vicious', 'ghosts', 'film', 'are', 'far', 'threatening', 'quickly', 'bring', 'smile', 'face', 'alleviate', 'tension', 'humor.However', 'Casper', 'not', 'rely', 'souly', 'laughter', 'strong', 'plot', 'back', 'up', 'spiritual', 'questions', 'make', 'think', 'very', 'heartfelt', 'moments', 'intense', 'emotion', 'grow', 'care', 'characters', 'watch', 'Casper', 'Kat', 'simultaneous', 'search', 'friendship', 'Dr.', 'Harvey', 'quest', 'resolve', 'own', 'unfinished', 'business', 'finally', 'get', 'closure.Malachi', 'Pearson', 'outstanding', 'job', 'voice', 'Casper', 'emotions', 'very', 'convincingly', 'can', 'also', 'look', 'forward', 'great', 'performance', 'Bill', 'Pullman', 'will', 'love', 'hating', 'bumbling', 'villains', 'portrayed', 'Cathy', 'Moriarty', 'Eric', 'Idle', 'Unfortunately', 'are', 'times', 'where', 'Christina', 'Ricci', 'have', 'difficulty', 'filling', 'role', 'Kat', 'occasionally', 'scenes', 'awkward', 'unconvincing.The', 'score', 'film', 'beautiful', 'great', 'deal', 'spirit', 'mood', 'movie.There', 'light', 'use', 'profanity', 'do', ""n't"", 'find', 'necessary', 'appropriate', 'family', 'film', 'aimed', 'largely', 'children', 'can', 'be', 'easily', 'overlooked']",N/A

Could it be something to do with the fact I never actually got around to watching it when I was young? Probably. BUT I did have the movie novelisation, complete with film stills. Hehe.I do get in the mood to watch kiddies' movies now again (or movies aimed purely at pre-teen squealing girls), it's something to do with reliving my childhood. But with Casper, I seriously don't think I could have watched this as a kid. It was so boring! The first half anyway. I thought it kicked it towards the end, but I was bored throughout the first half, and started texting on my phone. Not a good sign.However, I love Christina Ricci, she's definitely one of my favourite actresses, and have recently been watching some of her older films, after seeing Addams Family Values on TV! I always loved some of her older roles (Now & Then is a particular favourite), and she certainly surpassed herself in this, with having to act opposite a CGI character after all.I do wish there had been a bit more of a storyline with Casper & his deceased dad. There wasn't much mentioned about it, I kinda had an idea in my head of what Edward Scissorhands did, with the flashback interaction scenes between Johnny Depp & Vincent Price. (Technically not his dad, the inventor, but never mind.) And is it just me, or is it never clearly explained how Casper died? I found out on IMDB that he was playing on his sled all day, and got pneumonia, but I don't remember that being said. Or was that when I was texting?Casper is a safe family film. There are no innuendoes in this, as so many kiddie films have in them these days, which are for the adults to understand, and the kids to understand some day. It's safe, boring & predictable. I did get all emotional at the end (look out for Devon Sawa starring opposite Christina again, and sharing their second screen kiss!), but it does take a while to get going.

Dr. Harvey and his daughter Kat (Christina Ricci) are persuaded to leave Santa Fe and come to Friendship, Maine to live at Whipstaff Manor, to help new owner Carrigan Crittendon and her friend Dibs get rid of the ghosts haunting her manor. Casper the Friendly Ghost is very excited when he learns that Dr. Harvey and his pretty young daughter Kat are going to be living in his house (maybe he can finally make a friend!); but his ghostly uncles have other plans...The premise of Casper is that ghosts exist, are ""spirits with unfinished business"" (hence they have not yet ""crossed over""), and interact freely with ""live"" people at times;  (they haunt houses and wreak havoc on people who trespass there). For those who are worried about content: there is a scene where a man gets drunk in a bar and has an accident, there is a Halloween costume party, there are a few ghosts who are ""mean"" and play tricks and scare people, and a few arguments between characters in the film. There is a very sweet and innocent kiss between a girl and boy, but otherwise there is no objectionable content in that respect.

The story is one to which children and parents can relate, and the ghosts are not too scary, exhibiting the right mix of fright and comedy. The story also shows the common experiences and attitudes adolescents have in every century, and it is important for young people to be aware of these rites of passage. Cristina Ricci's character is touched when she learns about the tragedy that cut short the life of Casper, the young man whose spirit cannot rest or leave his childhood home. The ghostly encounter culminates in the sense of a dream coming true -- something from a fairy tale -- in the magical moment when she can see Casper and dance with him. I especially would recommend this film as a Halloween tradition for the entire family.",5,Excellent family film,1381968000,"10 17, 2013",2013,858,"['just', 'had', 'buy', 'DVD', 'had', 'been', 'ages', 'took', 'daughter', 'then', 'junior-high', 'age', 'see', 'movie', 'story', 'one', 'children', 'parents', 'can', 'relate', 'ghosts', 'are', 'not', 'too', 'scary', 'exhibiting', 'right', 'mix', 'fright', 'comedy', 'story', 'also', 'common', 'experiences', 'attitudes', 'adolescents', 'have', 'century', 'important', 'young', 'people', 'be', 'aware', 'rites', 'passage', 'Cristina', 'Ricci', 'character', 'touched', 'when', 'tragedy', 'cut', 'life', 'Casper', 'young', 'man', 'spirit', 'can', 'not', 'rest', 'leave', 'childhood', 'home', 'ghostly', 'encounter', 'culminates', 'sense', 'dream', 'coming', 'true', 'something', 'fairy', 'tale', 'magical', 'moment', 'when', 'can', 'see', 'Casper', 'dance', 'especially', 'would', 'recommend', 'film', 'Halloween', 'tradition', 'entire', 'family']",N/A

But when she enters the rickety mansion to seek her claim, she is frightened away by a wicked wave of ghosts. Determined to get her hands on this hidden fortune, she hires afterlife therapist Dr. James Harvey to exorcise the ghosts from the mansion. Harvey and his daughter Kat move in, and soon Kat meets Casper, the ghost of a young boy who's ""the friendliest ghost you know."" But not so friendly are Casper's uncles--Stretch, Fatso and Stinkie who are determined to drive all ""fleshies"" away. Ultimately, it is up to Harvey and Kat to help the ghosts cross over to the other side.  I've enjoyed this movie. It makes me laugh, cry, and excited.
