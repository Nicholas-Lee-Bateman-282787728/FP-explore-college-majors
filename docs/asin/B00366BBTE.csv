She believes that overweight people use obesity as an excuse for failure. Her journalism project is to enter that school in a very convincing fat suit, and prove that her own personality and drive will bring her the popularity and success that she is accustomed to as her thin, sports-playing self.Of course, reality takes her down a peg or two when she realizes that the other students not only deprive her of that chance for popularity and success, but are overtly hostile and insulting.On the surface, this plot seems too obvious and simple. However, the tale is told with great skill and just enough subtelty to make the suffering hit home in a very real way.To Be Fat Like Me is a DVD that belongs in every school and public library. This is a story that needs to be told.",5,"Sometimes, the truth is not pretty!",1288137600,"10 27, 2010",2010,894,"['Be', 'Fat', 'Me', 'based', 'true', 'story', 'student', 'who', 'high', 'school', 'undercover', 'agenda', 'overweight', 'people', 'use', 'obesity', 'excuse', 'failure', 'journalism', 'project', 'enter', 'school', 'very', 'convincing', 'fat', 'suit', 'prove', 'own', 'personality', 'drive', 'will', 'bring', 'popularity', 'success', 'accustomed', 'thin', 'sports-playing', 'self.Of', 'course', 'reality', 'down', 'peg', 'two', 'when', 'other', 'students', 'not', 'only', 'deprive', 'her', 'chance', 'popularity', 'success', 'are', 'overtly', 'hostile', 'surface', 'plot', 'too', 'obvious', 'simple', 'However', 'tale', 'told', 'great', 'skill', 'just', 'enough', 'subtelty', 'make', 'suffering', 'hit', 'home', 'very', 'real', 'way.To', 'Be', 'Fat', 'Me', 'DVD', 'school', 'public', 'library', 'story', 'be', 'told']",To Be Fat Like Me

We all are unique and one of a kind, but sometimes our differences become stumbling blocks when we meet less than tolerant people. Some of the best people in the world are oftentimes overlooked, shunned, or mistreated because of how they look. Nobody makes the rules so to speak, but peers usually dictate what is accepted or popular at any given time. Many times I have wondered how different the world would be if we were viewed from the inside out. Our differences make us unique, not less than what we should be.While this film is not too easy to watch at times, it should be viewed by students in this day and time of bullying and separation. Certainly a good study on what might be if we take the time to see that differences can influence our relationships in a great way if we let them.",4,Don't dare to be different.,1358294400,"01 16, 2013",2013,948,"['film', 'tough', 'watch', 'pretty', 'honest', 'how', 'people', 'are', 'treated', 'very', 'differently', 'when', 'presented', 'less', 'perfect', 'package', 'are', 'unique', 'one', 'kind', 'sometimes', 'differences', 'become', 'stumbling', 'blocks', 'when', 'meet', 'less', 'tolerant', 'people', 'best', 'people', 'world', 'are', 'oftentimes', 'overlooked', 'shunned', 'mistreated', 'how', 'look', 'Nobody', 'rules', 'so', 'speak', 'peers', 'usually', 'dictate', 'what', 'accepted', 'popular', 'given', 'time', 'Many', 'times', 'have', 'wondered', 'how', 'different', 'world', 'would', 'be', 'were', 'viewed', 'inside', 'out', 'differences', 'make', 'unique', 'not', 'less', 'what', 'should', 'be.While', 'film', 'not', 'too', 'easy', 'watch', 'times', 'should', 'be', 'viewed', 'students', 'day', 'time', 'bullying', 'separation', 'Certainly', 'good', 'study', 'what', 'might', 'be', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'differences', 'can', 'influence', 'relationships', 'great', 'way', 'let']",To Be Fat Like Me

She does a project to win a scholarship to college about how society treats overweight people. She goes in with one premise and comes out with another.
