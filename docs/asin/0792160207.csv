Here the husband is murdered, and his wife is convicted for the murder. She was asleep at the time, and knew nothing. But the bloody circumstantial evidence is irrefutable. [Did they check the DNA of the bloodstains, and whether it had EDTA as a preservative?] Libby's best friend adopts her child, and is given control of the $2 million trust fund. Libby is convicted and sent to prison.Libby makes a phone call to her best friend, and hears her son say ""Daddy""; no body was ever found. Libby gets parole, but escapes to track her friend. She finds out that her friend died in an explosion at home, her husband and son moved away. Knowing of her husband's art interests, she tracks him down. Converting stolen money into art work for later sale seems to leave no trail for the IRS. [Is this a tax loophole for the super-rich?]Libby tracks down her husband by his current name to New Orleans. Her parole officer is on her trail, but keeps missing her. Libby shows her savoir-faire by ordering an expensive dress that allows her entry to the soiree; her prison education? Her husband Nick fools her in a cemetery, and dumps her into a coffin. Locked in a coffin, she uses a handy tool to escape. There is an action-filled ending, where the villain is stopped before he can kill again. Libby will get a pardon, and rejoin her son. Overall, a good film with a happy ending. But could her husband have begun a new rich life in New Orleans so easily?

Ashley Judd plays Libby Parsons, a woman framed by her husband of his murder, and she finds herself quickly convicted and sentenced to prison while he (played by Bruce Greenwood) makes his own handy escape.When finally released from prison on parole, Libby is unable to locate either her `dead' husband or her young son, so she devises a plan to find them. This means jumping parole, which energizes parole officer Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones) into hot pursuit, and a terrific cat and mouse game (played on several levels at once) ensues. The repartee between Judd and Jones works well, and one can tell that Jones is doing more than walking through his lines here.The thrills are consistent, often quite novel, and the sequences work well because all of the ensemble cast puts in credible performances and let the quite professional level of action sequences speak for themselves. There are a number of diverting plot twists, and one finds the conclusion both entertaining and plausible, something not many recent thrillers seem able to do at the same time. While neither of the principals was likely to receive consideration for an academy award, their performances are quite good. This is a good action thriller, and one I can highly recommend.

Unfortunately I sat there on my couch for 90 minutes (it seemed more  like a prison sentence), stupefied, frankly appalled at everything I  saw.I ask what was going through anyone's head when they made this?  Ashley Judd, a solid actress who did a fine job in &quot;Heat&quot; is  absolutely wasted in this film. She plays a Mother, wrongfully accused of  murdering her husband who is locked up for seven years. Her husband has of  course framed her so he can collect insurance money. Tommy Lee Jones who  has given great performances in both &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and  &quot;Under Siege&quot; is completely wasted as well. He basically is  playing a meaner version of his Sam Gerrard &quot;Fugitive&quot; role.  Bruce Berresford, the director of &quot;Driving Mrs. Daisy&quot; seems  completely incompetent. Not only is this movie poorly made but it is not  even marginally entertaining in the slightest fashion. Stop trying to make  thrillers Brucey ( you made Silent Fall too), because a two year old could  produce a better film than this.This movie plods along in the most dull,  contrived and predictable fashion. It single handedly indulges in just  about every film cliche known to man. Ashley Judd is a mushy character not  nearly as hard-edged as the trailers might suggest.I could rant and rave  about this film for hours. This movie is basically a TV movie that somehow  made its way to the big screen.

The problem is that in the second half of the movie, instead of keeping her in this quite natural mindset, the writer has her start waffling on how she wants to handle the bad guy. It never regains its momentum after that point despite a really good scene in a mausoleum with a casket in New Orleans.  Bruce Beresford is typically an excellent director so it is hard to say why he stuck with the second half of this contrived, predictable script.  Also, someone should have read up on DNA evidence for near the start of the film there is a crime scene that is drenched with blood.  It is presumed that a certain person died there albeit there is no body.

Double Jeopardy is merely  okay.Judd plays a woman, named Libby Parsons, who lives a fairly nice  life, until one day, her husband goes missing while on a sailing  expedition.  Libby is found covered in his blood, and he is declared dead,  after searches turn up nothing.  All evidence points towards her, and she  is sent to prison for his murder.  While incarcerated, she finds out that  he faked his death, and is living abroad with their young child.

The rest of the movie deals with her trying to find her  husband and, more importantly, her son.Judd and Jones are truly  exceptional in the film.  The role seemed to be made for Jones, and Ashley  Judd did a wonderful job as always, and she was said to have performed all  of her own stunts.The real problem with the film is that it is extremely  predictable.  This is Hollywood, and about twenty-five minutes into the  movie, when her so-called &quot;great awakening&quot; takes place in  prison, it is so obvious as to how the film will end.  There were some very  minor twists throughout the film, but the ending still remained crystal  clear.Overall, the film was okay.  Besides the good acting, there were  some nice action scenes.

Tommy Lee Jones looks as though he might be on the verge of firing his agent &amp; getting him someone who wouldn't keep casting him in these  roles.  Ashley Judd, beautiful to look at, had more to go with in terms of  character in the tiny part she had in Michael Mann's Heat. Even with all of  the plot holes and contrivances in the script, another, more savvy director  like Brian DePalma, Sam Raimi, the Coen brothers or Ridley Scott could have  delivered a movie with thrills.  At the very least these directors would  experiment with camera angles and different ways to try to get into the  character's psyche.  In fact, the rainy chase scene looked like Bruce  Beresford was trying to imitate Ridley Scott's eerie rainy chase scene in  Blade Runner.  What if, instead of Ashley Judd's character waking up in bed  covered wioth blood, she was awakened by the Coast Gaurd on the deck of the  boat, still covered with blood &amp; the knife in already in her hand.  This would allow the character &amp; the audience to question her sanity.  Shift the personal training &quot;Rocky&quot; rip-off montage to when  Ashley Judd first arrives in jail, as opposed to when she finally learns  that her husband is still alive, and you have a woman out to survive a  rough stay in prison, someone more likely to seek revenge when she learns  of her hubby's evil deeds. Mr. Beresford fails at this miserably, directing  the film with as much style and flair as a lesser made for TV movie.

She gives custody of their son to her best friend.Then the friend stops bringing her son to visit, and Libby finally tracks her down on the phone...and hears her son saying ""daddy."" Of course, nobody will listen to her claims, so she takes the advice of a (literal) jailhouse lawyer who tells her about double jeopardy--the guarantee in the Constitution that you cannot be tried for the same crime twice. Libby does her time, gets out on parole, and sets about looking for the man who set her up. She's thwarted and later abetted by Travis Lehman, her parole officer (Tommy Lee Jones).It doesn't work this way in real life--even if someone faked their own death, it wouldn't give a person who'd been convicted of their murder a free license to kill them in cold blood. They couldn't be tried for the same crime twice, but that wouldn't be considered the same crime.Be that as it may, it really doesn't matter to my enjoyment of the movie. I love the premise, and the revenge story is very sweet. The character of Libby goes from a fairly bland, contented wife and mother to a determined woman with a mission, and I enjoyed seeing her find her inner strength. Lehman likewise finds more in himself than he thought he had--he'd been steadily going downhill and was cynical and unsympathetic. Libby's determination inspires him to go from sticking to the black-and-white of his job to taking a stand and risking everything for what he thinks is right.This is one of those movies where justice prevails in a way we wish it would in real life.

Libby Parsons is charged with the murder of her husband, Nick, whom we  later find out has staged his own death in order to escape financial ruin.  He then takes his son, and his nanny that he later marries, and moves away  to a place where Libby cannot contact her son, Maddy.

The basic premise is flawed.  Even if the double jeopardy law allowed Libby  (Ashley Judd) to kill her husband without penalty after serving her time  (which it doesn't), she would still go back to jail for parole violations  (possession of a weapon among other things).  The plot line is threadbare  from overuse.  This is a cross between ""The Fugitive"" and ""The Pelican  Brief"";  innocent girl chasing after the bad guy while everyone is chasing  after her.This film asks the viewer to leap chasm after chasm of  incredulity.  Let's examine some of the malarkey they ask us to swallow.  Do they expect us to believe that Libby wakes up covered with blood, sees a  knife on the deck and doesn't expect foul play?  Is there anyone on the  planet stupid enough to pick up the knife and make themselves the prime  murder suspect?  When she's in jail and suspects that her husband is alive,  why isn't she calling her lawyer, the prosecutor, the press and anyone else  she knows who could hire a private investigator to find him?  When Travis  (Tommy Lee Jones) caught her, are we really supposed to believe that he  would leave his keys in the car with her inside?  And after she crashed  four times into other cars and knocked one off the back of the ferry, no  one noticed?  And my favorite; why didn't Nick (Bruce Greenwood) strangle  her before stuffing her in the coffin with her knapsack with the gun in it?  Even if he had forgotten that Travis told him that Libby had a gun, don't  tell me he couldn't feel the weight of a handgun in the knapsack.Tommy  Lee Jones was out of gas in this film.  Between ""The Fugitive"", ""US  Marshals"", and this, he has played the same character in the same situation  so many times in succession that he has grown flaccid from boredom. Ashley  Judd was actually excellent, and was the only reason to see the film.  Her  athleticism as well as her intensity impressed me.  It is seldom that you  will see a female actress agree to do her own stunts, especially one that  involves escaping from a submerged vehicle.Acclaimed director Bruce  Beresford proves that a big budget, bankable stars and talented filming  cannot save a trashy script.  The filming of this movie was technically  excellent, containing good suspense, thrilling stunt work, great chase  scenes and plenty of plot twists.  But Beresford must have decided that all  the plot holes didn't matter, since he didn't demand rewrites.  So I place  the blame for this tripe squarely in his lap.I think I was being  generous in rating this film a 5/10.

130389,A3LU79BYMWZEW9,0792160207,Gregor von Kallahann,"[0, 0]","I was visiting a senior citizen friend who asked me if I had ever seen this movie.  To tell the truth, I couldn't be sure just which Ashley Judd thrillers I had seen and which I hadn't, but since my friend seemed so fond of the movie, I couldn't really object to watching it with him.  Two minutes into the darn thing, however, I realized this was indeed the one Judd potboiler I HAD seen, and the basic premise about a woman framed for her husband's murder came back to me, but the specifics of the plot had been lost in the haze of memory, I figured, why the heck not re-watch it?As it turned out, however, this was not the kind of movie I would usually watch a second time.  It is, as many reviewers are quick to point out, entertaining enough, despite its many plot holes and apparent legal incongruities (thank you to the many commentators who have maintained that legally you CAN be tried for the same murder twice, if it's proven that the first ""murder"" did not actually take place).  But, OK, we'll suspend legal disbelief and go along with the conceit.  And we'll also go along with the conceit that hatred and a passionate desire for vengeance could turn a fairly conventional soccer mom into a lean, mean fighting machine--who also happens to be diabolically clever and resourceful.  Well, ""diabolically clever"" when she isn't doing something extremely dumb and ultimately self-destructive, that is.(SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING) I would have to agree with those reviewers (including the Amazon reviewer above) who maintain that the movie is weakened considerably by making Ashley Judd's character more traditionally maternal than bitterly vengeful.  Had she been so consumed by hatred that she was ready, willing and eager to take advantage of the (specious) double jeopardy clause, the movie would have been more suspenseful.  (Will she be driven to the edge?  Will she pull back into something like sanity at the nick of time?)  But really, all she seems to want is her kid back--and she'll let criminal bygones be bygones.  And, aww shucks, isn't THAT understandable?Which is not to say that Ashley Judd isn't as elegant as ever or that Tommy Lee Jones doesn't give his usual solid performance.  The movie is fast-paced enough to keep the viewer's attention.  And there are plenty of unforeseen plot turns, lots of changes of scenery and some interesting supporting roles (that I also wished had been fleshed out a little more).One striking aspect was the change in the physical appearance of the young actress, Annabeth Gish.  The cute, pert young girl from ST. ELSEWHERE and MYSTIC PIZZA seems suddenly almost Amazonian here.  Not unattractive, but certainly no longer the sweetly innocent young thing she played so handily as a teen/young adult.  Ten years later, she's got enough of that sinister thing going on that no one would ever call her miscast here.We all demand different things from movies: that's a given.  I could see that my senior citizen friend was drawn to the movie, in part, because of the striking opening shots of the Washington State coast--a part of the country where he had spent a good deal of time as a young man.  That and the fact that he seems to like thrillers in general.  I do too, but I like to see my characters just a tad more developed.  It helps me to care about their fates.",3,"I'll Take ""Ashley Judd Thrillers"" For $400, Alex",1201305600,"01 26, 2008",2008,3324,"['was', 'visiting', 'senior', 'citizen', 'friend', 'who', 'asked', 'had', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'tell', 'truth', 'could', ""n't"", 'be', 'sure', 'just', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'thrillers', 'had', 'seen', 'had', ""n't"", 'friend', 'seemed', 'so', 'fond', 'movie', 'could', ""n't"", 'really', 'object', 'watching', 'Two', 'minutes', 'darn', 'thing', 'however', 'realized', 'was', 'indeed', 'one', 'Judd', 'potboiler', 'HAD', 'seen', 'basic', 'premise', 'woman', 'framed', 'husband', 'murder', 'came', 'back', 'specifics', 'plot', 'had', 'been', 'lost', 'haze', 'memory', 'figured', 'why', 'heck', 'not', 're-watch', 'turned', 'out', 'however', 'was', 'not', 'kind', 'movie', 'would', 'usually', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'many', 'reviewers', 'are', 'quick', 'point', 'out', 'entertaining', 'enough', 'many', 'plot', 'holes', 'apparent', 'legal', 'incongruities', 'thank', 'many', 'commentators', 'who', 'have', 'maintained', 'legally', 'CAN', 'be', 'tried', 'same', 'murder', 'twice', 'first', 'murder', 'did', 'not', 'actually', 'take', 'place', 'OK', ""'ll"", 'suspend', 'legal', 'disbelief', 'go', 'along', 'conceit', ""'ll"", 'also', 'go', 'along', 'conceit', 'hatred', 'passionate', 'desire', 'vengeance', 'could', 'turn', 'fairly', 'conventional', 'soccer', 'mom', 'lean', 'mean', 'fighting', 'machine', 'who', 'also', 'be', 'diabolically', 'clever', 'resourceful', 'Well', 'diabolically', 'clever', 'when', ""n't"", 'doing', 'something', 'extremely', 'dumb', 'ultimately', 'self-destructive', 'SLIGHT', 'SPOILER', 'WARNING', 'would', 'have', 'agree', 'reviewers', 'including', 'Amazon', 'reviewer', 'who', 'maintain', 'movie', 'weakened', 'considerably', 'making', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'character', 'more', 'traditionally', 'maternal', 'bitterly', 'vengeful', 'Had', 'been', 'so', 'consumed', 'hatred', 'was', 'ready', 'willing', 'eager', 'take', 'advantage', 'specious', 'double', 'jeopardy', 'clause', 'movie', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'more', 'suspenseful', 'Will', 'be', 'driven', 'edge', 'Will', 'pull', 'back', 'something', 'sanity', 'nick', 'time', 'really', 'want', 'kid', 'back', ""'ll"", 'let', 'criminal', 'bygones', 'be', 'bygones', 'aww', 'shucks', ""n't"", 'THAT', 'understandable', 'Which', 'not', 'say', 'Ashley', 'Judd', ""n't"", 'as', 'elegant', 'ever', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', ""n't"", 'give', 'usual', 'solid', 'performance', 'movie', 'fast-paced', 'enough', 'keep', 'viewer', 'attention', 'are', 'plenty', 'unforeseen', 'plot', 'turns', 'lots', 'changes', 'scenery', 'interesting', 'supporting', 'roles', 'also', 'wished', 'had', 'been', 'fleshed', 'out', 'little', 'more', '.One', 'striking', 'aspect', 'was', 'change', 'physical', 'appearance', 'young', 'actress', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'cute', 'pert', 'young', 'girl', 'ST', 'ELSEWHERE', 'MYSTIC', 'PIZZA', 'suddenly', 'almost', 'Amazonian', 'here', 'Not', 'unattractive', 'certainly', 'no', 'longer', 'sweetly', 'innocent', 'young', 'thing', 'played', 'so', 'handily', 'teen/young', 'adult', 'Ten', 'years', 'later', 'got', 'enough', 'sinister', 'thing', 'going', 'one', 'would', 'ever', 'call', 'miscast', 'here.We', 'demand', 'different', 'things', 'movies', 'given', 'could', 'see', 'senior', 'citizen', 'friend', 'was', 'drawn', 'movie', 'part', 'striking', 'opening', 'shots', 'Washington', 'State', 'coast', 'part', 'country', 'where', 'had', 'spent', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'young', 'man', 'fact', 'like', 'thrillers', 'general', 'do', 'too', 'like', 'see', 'characters', 'just', 'tad', 'more', 'developed', 'care', 'fates']",N/A

Lucky for me, it was still entertaining.Double Jeopardy stars Ashley Judd (you know, the good  looking Judd) and Tommy Lee Jones (you know, the guy from the male version  of The Fugitive?). Judd is convicted of killing her husband and after being  sent to prison discovers that he is still alive. Of course, she has already  been convicted of the crime, so she is legally free to murder him now, as  she can not be tried again. And so off she goes breaking parole when she is  finally released, and off goes Tommy Lee Jones after her as her parole  officer who thinks she really may have gotten the raw end of the  deal.The film feels extremely similar to The Fugitive, perhaps a lot  because of Jones. Whatever the reason, we get the general idea of how this  film is going to go from the beginning. For that reason, we are very  forgiving for the film's implausible episodes.In the end, Double  Jeopardy survives and is entertaining due to the talents of its main stars.  Judd is as always, enjoyable to watch. Jones is one of our best actors  today, and he shows it again here by playing a poorly written character,  but making it mighty enjoyable to watch.

Main thing that was a drag: the trailer gives the movie away completely. I mean, the big PAYOFF scene (and line) is even in it! Another reviewer said it best-I felt like after seeing the trailer, I was watching the movie for the second time upon first viewing. Execs have argued, 'well, the trailer got the audience into the theater big time, so there'. That's no excuse...I guess for the execs, it works out great, but for the audience who pay to see a movie and want at least a TINY bit of surprise or suspense and feel let down, it's just not fair.There were a few good scenes; most not given away ahead of time. My favorite moments were those that were not in the trailer-like the scene in the library when Libby gets hit on. I also liked the scene where Libby finally tracks down her evil husband and stages her first meeting with him for maximum dramatic effect, and is dressed to kill to boot. I loved Judd's two tough prison pals. Tommy Lee Jones is always fun to watch. Even though he played pretty much the same character/storyline as he did in The Fugitive and the sequel, I'm not complaining. The movie is worth a rental, at least, if you are bored. It does entertain and I did find myself rooting for Judd a few times. But again...if you've seen the trailer, you've pretty much seen the movie.

130446,A1YHHM3QFKCBCK,0792160207,M2,"[2, 3]","""Double Jeopardy"" has such a high ""check-your-brain-at-the-door"" quotient that you have to wonder if it was made by adults.  I could see a bunch of clever fourth-graders coming up with the plot of this movie, but anybody know knows anything whatsoever about the legal system, even the legal system in movies, will want to flush this epic.  Ashley Judd and her amazing one expression plays a loving (but incredibly stupid) wife and mother who is convicted of killing her husband and sent to prison.  There's no body, but the court takes the prosecutors' word for it.  Then in prison she learns that hubby set her up by faking his own death, and is now shacked up with her best friend and her young son.  Of course, she can't tell this to anyone because the system has no interest in reopening cases.  But on the advice of a fellow inmate, a one-time lawyer and husband-killer, she does manage to convince the parole board that she'll be a good little girl, so they let her out of prison after serving six years of a murder sentence.  Sure, why not?  She goes to a halfway house run by Tommy Lee Jones, who is so inept that she manages to steal his gun from him, and then sets out on a quest across the country to track down hubby and get her child back (hubby has already murdered the best friend/surrogate mother).  We are led to believe her goal is to really kill her husband this time, since she can't be charged twice for the same crime, under double jeopardy (and what better way to impress your ten-year-old son than reemerging as a stranger and blowing away his dad!).  Jones tracks her as she leaves a trail of destruction (Judd's character never met a car she didn't wreck) and thievery all across the US.  In most scenes Jones seems to be wincing, perhaps as he remembers winning an Oscar for a similar role in an infinitely better film called ""The Fugitive.""

I feel like a patrol cop telling the crowd &quot;keep moving, there's nothing to see here.&quot;Ashley Judd gives another lackluster performance as a well-to-do wife who gets sent to prison for 6 years. You'd think she was sent to the time out corner instead. Judd portrays the same character leaving prison as she DOES when she enters. Wait, I take that back. Her character does do some sit ups to prove that she's tough now. Please .And you'd think this was another in the Fugitive series like US Marshalls was. Tommy Lee Jones needs to watch out that he doesn't make another movie where he's chasing a convict, or that's all he's going to be known for. Jones is a great character actor, and I love his work, but nothing he can do can help this lame duck of a script.The final nail in the coffin for me was the finale, which is shot in New Orleans. I'm from Louisiana, so perhaps I'm more sensitive than most, but few movies get the accents right. One of the few movies that come to mind that does get it right is Heaven's Prisoners. Suffice to say that Double Jeopardy butchers the accent. Not to mention the fact that everything is set in the French Quarter, as if that's the only thing IN New Orleans.Overall, this film is nothing but a series of cliches and cop outs. None of the characters have any depth. They are simply cardboard cutouts set against a paper thin story.

130451,A152C8GYY25HAH,0792160207,Matthew Horner,"[1, 1]","I am happy to report that I liked ""Double Jeopardy"" a lot more than I thought I would. It's plot is neither original nor, frankly, all that interesting, but the movie is so fast-paced and professional that its parts are greater than its sum. Ashley Judd and Tommy Lee Jones play roles that have almost literally played before, yet they are such likable stars that we don't mind that much. I think I am on the right track in saying these things. The movie was a huge boxoffice hit.The film's title refers to a long-standing legal rule that says that a person cannot be tried twice for the same crime. I should warn anyone formerly or presently imprisoned for a crime they did not commit that, in the real world, this rule would not apply to the events depicted in ""Double Jeopardy.""Libby Parsons [Ashley Judd] is happily married to a successful guy named Nick [Bruce Greenwood]. She thinks she is, anyway. One day the couple decides to leave their young son in the care of a friend, Angela [Annabeth Gish] while they go sailing. That night, Libby is awakened on the yacht by a fierce storm. Nick is not in the bed, and there is blood on her hands. Nick, it turns out, is not on the vessel at all. A Coast Guard ship soon approaches, and Libby is rescued. A few days later, she is charged with murder, even though Nick's body is never recovered. Perhaps because of her not so competent lawyer, she is convicted and sent to prison. Before she goes, she asks Angela to adopt her son, so that he won't become a ward of the state.Libby eventually adjusts to prison life and gets to see her son from time to time. One day, the visits stop. Desperate and distraught, she manages to track down Angela. She phones the woman and demands to talk to her son. In this conversation, she discovers to her horror that not only is Nick alive, he's married to Angela. Libby bides her time. After her parole a few years later, she is assigned to a halfway house run by Travis Lehman [Tommy Lee Jones]. She doesn't stick around long and runs off, intending to do to Nick what she didn't do to him in the first place. Travis has no choice but to pursue her. [NOTE: There is very little I have said here that wasn't shown in the movie's trailers, so, if you think I've given too much away, blame Paramount. The real adventure begins after these events anyway.]When ""Double Jeopardy"" first opened, many critics dismissed it as a potboiler. I think they somewhat lazily zeroed in on the obvious. By that measuring stick, ""Titanic"" could be called a clinker. ""Mission Impossible"" could be branded as preposterous. Actually, these movies are those things. But they also serve a larger purpose, because they are vastly entertaining. As entertainment, ""Double Jeopardy"" is a winner.

It starts off a bit similar to the true story TV movies that my mum watches. A woman (Ashley Judd) who can't see the chemistry between her husband & her best friend, and then her husband 'dies' and frames her for his murder. She gets sent to jail. Meanwhile, she allows her 'best friend' to adopt her son, and they go away and become one big happy family.Why?For money of course. It makes the world go round. For some reason, despite being in jail for murder, she only serves 6 years, comes out on parole, and immediately goes after her husband, who's now changed his name TWICE (exactly how does she manage to find him?), and her 'best friend' has died in a mysterious gas explosion.Then we throw in Tommy Lee Jones to the mix, at his deadpan best. He actually cracks a smile at one point! He was actually the saving grace in this film, as I can take Ashley Judd either way. The film gets better when he comes into it, and it soon becomes pretty fast paced, including a very scary, very claustrophobic scene when she's 'buried' (in a crypt or tomb or whatever they're called) along with an old dude.Although it's very good film, it's got the impression it's been done before, with better actors, and it's not memorable, it's a by-the-numbers-chase-and-kill-the-guy.

Tresca ""Talien""","[1, 4]","Continuing the Ashley Judd series of movies that I for some reason keep putting on my Netflix list, I decided to give Ms. Judd a second chance by watching Double Jeopardy.  By now, we all know the formula: pretty young lead and older, grizzled veteran team up to fight crime.  Only in this case, the twist is that Libby Parsons (Judd) is actually on the wrong side of the law.Libby lives in perfect harmony with her husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood) and son Matty (Benjamin Weir).  Only Nick is a particularly vile brand of sleazeball.  While away on a boating trip (and after a scene that involves far more of Judd than Twisted every showed), Libby wakes up with her husband missing and blood on her hands...literally. She is tried and convicted for murder.Sounds like a quick end to the movie, right?  Not exactly.  Libby discovers that her husband is still alive and has since shacked up with Libby's best friend, Angie Green (Annabeth Gish).  As one inmate succinctly explains, Libby can kill her husband, since she can't be convicted of the same crime twice. Why?  Because that would be...DOUBLE JEOPARDY!""...the state says you already killed your husband right? So, when you get out of here, you track him down, and you can kill him. You can walk up to him in Times Square put a gun to his head and pull the trigger and there's nothing they can do about it! Kinda makes you feel all warm and tingly inside don't it?""This is, of course, patently untrue.  In Movieland, Double Jeopardy makes it seem like killing her husband would let her get off without any punishment.  In reality, Libby could be tried by the state government instead of the federal government, for another separate but related crime, or worst of all, end up with her son being taken away from her.  The real driving force in the movie is Libby's love for her son, a child that obviously can't be left in the manipulating clutches of her murderous husband.In essence, the whole premise of the movie is a tease.  It's not even important whether or not double jeopardy applies; it's clear that Libby doesn't want to kill her husband anyway. ""I don't want to kill you, Nick,"" says Libby. ""I just want you to suffer."" She wants her son back, and that's that.Somewhere in the middle of this mess is the redoubtable Tommy Lee Jones as Travis Lehman, in the same role of a parole officer he played in The Fugitive and U.S. Marshals.  His role is largely irrelevant, except to represent the ever-present threat of the law that dogs Libby's ever step.Everyone speaks their lines with the appropriate level of enthusiasm, but really, there's not a whole lot for anyone to do.  Mostly, Libby pines for her son, slowly unraveling the tangled web her husband has weaved to cover up his hasty departure from life and marriage. Somehow, Libby doesn't manage to age at all in the years she's been in prison.The best part of the film is when Libby, dressed to the nines, confronts her husband at a charity auction. If the film were half as good as that scene, it would have been truly something.  Instead, we have a lackluster script, a flimsy premise, and the talents of Tommy Lee Jones wasted on what amounts to the Female Fugitive.",2,The Fugitive: Judd-Style,1153008000,"07 16, 2006",2006,3187,"['Continuing', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'series', 'movies', 'reason', 'keep', 'putting', 'Netflix', 'list', 'decided', 'give', 'Ms.', 'Judd', 'second', 'chance', 'watching', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'now', 'know', 'formula', 'pretty', 'young', 'lead', 'older', 'grizzled', 'veteran', 'team', 'up', 'fight', 'crime', 'Only', 'case', 'twist', 'Libby', 'Parsons', 'Judd', 'actually', 'wrong', 'side', 'law.Libby', 'perfect', 'harmony', 'husband', 'Nick', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'son', 'Matty', 'Benjamin', 'Weir', 'Only', 'Nick', 'particularly', 'vile', 'brand', 'sleazeball', 'away', 'boating', 'trip', 'scene', 'far', 'more', 'Judd', 'Twisted', 'showed', 'Libby', 'up', 'husband', 'missing', 'blood', 'hands', 'literally', 'tried', 'convicted', 'murder.Sounds', 'quick', 'end', 'movie', 'right', 'Not', 'exactly', 'Libby', 'husband', 'still', 'alive', 'shacked', 'up', 'Libby', 'best', 'friend', 'Angie', 'Green', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'one', 'inmate', 'succinctly', 'Libby', 'can', 'kill', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'convicted', 'same', 'crime', 'twice', 'Why', 'would', 'be', 'DOUBLE', 'JEOPARDY', 'state', 'already', 'killed', 'husband', 'right', 'So', 'when', 'get', 'here', 'track', 'down', 'can', 'kill', 'can', 'walk', 'up', 'Times', 'Square', 'put', 'gun', 'head', 'pull', 'trigger', 'nothing', 'can', 'do', 'Kinda', 'feel', 'warm', 'tingly', 'inside', 'do', ""n't"", 'course', 'patently', 'untrue', 'Movieland', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'seem', 'killing', 'husband', 'would', 'let', 'get', 'off', 'punishment', 'reality', 'Libby', 'could', 'be', 'tried', 'state', 'government', 'instead', 'federal', 'government', 'separate', 'related', 'crime', 'worst', 'end', 'up', 'son', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'real', 'driving', 'force', 'movie', 'Libby', 'love', 'son', 'child', 'obviously', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'left', 'manipulating', 'clutches', 'murderous', 'husband.In', 'essence', 'whole', 'premise', 'movie', 'tease', 'not', 'even', 'important', 'not', 'double', 'jeopardy', 'applies', 'clear', 'Libby', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'husband', 'anyway', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'kill', 'Nick', 'Libby', 'just', 'want', 'suffer', 'son', 'back', 'that.Somewhere', 'middle', 'mess', 'redoubtable', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Travis', 'Lehman', 'same', 'role', 'parole', 'officer', 'played', 'Fugitive', 'U.S', 'Marshals', 'role', 'largely', 'irrelevant', 'represent', 'ever-present', 'threat', 'law', 'Libby', 'ever', 'step.Everyone', 'lines', 'appropriate', 'level', 'enthusiasm', 'really', 'not', 'whole', 'lot', 'anyone', 'do', 'Mostly', 'Libby', 'pines', 'son', 'slowly', 'unraveling', 'tangled', 'web', 'husband', 'weaved', 'cover', 'up', 'hasty', 'departure', 'life', 'marriage', 'Somehow', 'Libby', ""n't"", 'manage', 'age', 'years', 'been', 'prison.The', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'when', 'Libby', 'dressed', 'nines', 'husband', 'charity', 'auction', 'film', 'were', 'half', 'as', 'good', 'scene', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'truly', 'something', 'Instead', 'have', 'lackluster', 'script', 'flimsy', 'premise', 'talents', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'wasted', 'what', 'amounts', 'Female', 'Fugitive']",N/A

130462,A16EZ4MT9BFF2R,0792160207,Mike Murray,"[0, 0]","Elizabeth Parsons (Ashley Judd) is a happy woman.  She has a handsome husband, who's popular with the local community, a son, Matty, she  treasures, a beautiful seaside home, and a friend, Angie, who her son  loves.  This is a woman who you quickly feel has it all.  Just as quickly,  something goes terribly wrong.  Her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood),  surprises Liz by showing her a large sailboat and suggests that they take  it out for a spin before he buys it for her.  We next see Liz happy at the  helm of this boat and all seems idyllic.What happens next is not so  idyllic.  Liz, who has been drinking, wakes up to find her robe, the bed,  the floor, and just about anywhere you can look covered with blood.  There  are blood trails, bloody handprints, bloody footprints, leading out of the  cabin, up the stairs, and over the side of the boat, now shrouded in fog.  Liz looks down at the deck, sees a bloody knife and makes her first  apparent mistake; she picks it up.  Just as she does so, a Coast Guard  cutter pulls up and compels her to put the knife down.A few scenes  later, with no sign of Nick's body, Liz finds herself under arrest and also  finds a healthy dose of evidence that she did the deed.  Without much ado,  Liz is convicted and sent to prison. She asks her friend, Angie (Annabeth  Gish) to adopt Matty because she knows Matty loves Angie.  This  accomplished, Liz sees Angie and Matty for a visit or two when suddenly  Angie stops bringing Matty to the prison.  When Liz calls Angie, she finds  the number disconnected.So far, so good.  However, now the contrivances  kick in.  Without so much as a disguised voice, Liz calls the school  district where Angie works pretending to be Angie verifying the address of  &quot;her&quot; severance checks.  From this call, Liz discovers Angie has  moved to San Francisco.  So, Liz calls; Angie answers; a heated discussion  follows.  Finally, Liz gets to speak to Matty.  While talking, the  apartment door open and who walks in but Nick, presumed dead.  Matty says  &quot;Daddy!&quot; and suddenly, Liz realizes she's been set  up.Apparently, she tells all of this to two inmates who have taken Liz  under their wing even though there's no compelling reason for them to do  so.  Roma Maffia and Davenia McFadden play the inmates, respectively  Margaret Skolowski and Evelyn Lake.  Skolowski, a convicted murderer who  happened to be an attorney, tells Liz that she can actually kill her  husband since she's already been convicted of murdering him anyway, a  provision of the Constitution's Fifth Amendment.Now, for those of you  who've read my earlier review of The Negotiator, some of what follows may  sound familiar.  All of this action to this point has taken place in the  span of a half-hour; notice, nowhere have I mentioned the character played  by Tommy Lee Jones.  That character is Travis Lehman, her parole officer  who is portrayed as a no nonsense guy who doesn't give second  chances.What follows from here to the end is a film I couldn't help  compare with 1993's The Fugitive.  Lehman pursues Liz across Washington  State, Colorado, and New Orleans, as she herself follows the trail of her  missing son and the husband who framed her.This film had the potential  to be a great thriller and one reason it got even two stars was for a  marvelous Hitchcockian sequence in a New Orleans cemetary that was actually  pulled off by director Bruce Beresford.  The climatic scene was  near-perfect as well.  What falters is the overly contrived script by David  Weisberg and Douglas S. Cook, who were responsible for The Rock, where they  did a much better job.  Weisberg and Cook sets up situations and then don't  follow their own rules.  So, instead of a taut thriller where you wonder  how our heroine is going to accomplish her tasks, the whole thing comes off  as kind of lethargic.Jones gives a journeyman performance as Lehman, the  parole officer who comes to realize that he's pursuing an innocent woman.  Judd is excellent and does everything that's asked of her, although at  times, she seemed a bit subdued.  Bruce Greenwood imbued Nick with a kind  of charm you could almost love if you didn't know what he's done to his  wife.I love mysteries; I wanted to highly recommend this film, but in  the end, I can't.  Double Jeopardy may be an OK way to spend a rainy  afternoon, to view at a discount movie house, or to rival a TV-movie, but  as a top-notch thriller, it doesn't make the grade.[Originally written  25 September 1999]",2,Wheel Of Misfortune,967852800,"09 2, 2000",2000,4527,"['Elizabeth', 'Parsons', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'happy', 'woman', 'handsome', 'husband', 'who', 'popular', 'local', 'community', 'son', 'Matty', 'beautiful', 'seaside', 'home', 'friend', 'Angie', 'who', 'son', 'woman', 'who', 'quickly', 'feel', 'Just', 'quickly', 'something', 'terribly', 'wrong', 'husband', 'Nick', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'Liz', 'showing', 'large', 'sailboat', 'take', 'out', 'spin', 'next', 'see', 'Liz', 'happy', 'helm', 'boat', 'idyllic.What', 'next', 'not', 'so', 'idyllic', 'Liz', 'who', 'been', 'drinking', 'up', 'find', 'robe', 'bed', 'floor', 'just', 'about', 'anywhere', 'can', 'look', 'covered', 'blood', 'are', 'blood', 'trails', 'bloody', 'handprints', 'bloody', 'footprints', 'leading', 'cabin', 'up', 'stairs', 'side', 'boat', 'now', 'shrouded', 'fog', 'Liz', 'down', 'deck', 'bloody', 'knife', 'first', 'apparent', 'mistake', 'up', 'Just', 'so', 'Coast', 'Guard', 'cutter', 'up', 'compels', 'put', 'knife', 'down.A', 'few', 'scenes', 'later', 'sign', 'Nick', 'body', 'Liz', 'arrest', 'also', 'healthy', 'dose', 'evidence', 'did', 'deed', 'much', 'ado', 'Liz', 'convicted', 'sent', 'prison', 'friend', 'Angie', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'adopt', 'Matty', 'Matty', 'Angie', 'accomplished', 'Liz', 'Angie', 'Matty', 'visit', 'two', 'when', 'suddenly', 'Angie', 'bringing', 'Matty', 'prison', 'When', 'Liz', 'Angie', 'number', 'disconnected.So', 'far', 'so', 'good', 'However', 'now', 'contrivances', 'kick', 'so', 'much', 'disguised', 'voice', 'Liz', 'school', 'district', 'where', 'Angie', 'pretending', 'be', 'Angie', 'verifying', 'address', 'quot', 'quot', 'severance', 'checks', 'call', 'Liz', 'Angie', 'moved', 'San', 'Francisco', 'So', 'Liz', 'Angie', 'answers', 'heated', 'discussion', 'Finally', 'Liz', 'speak', 'Matty', 'talking', 'apartment', 'door', 'open', 'who', 'walks', 'Nick', 'presumed', 'dead', 'Matty', 'quot', 'Daddy', 'quot', 'suddenly', 'Liz', 'been', 'set', 'up.Apparently', 'two', 'inmates', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'Liz', 'wing', 'even', 'compelling', 'reason', 'do', 'so', 'Roma', 'Maffia', 'Davenia', 'McFadden', 'play', 'inmates', 'respectively', 'Margaret', 'Skolowski', 'Evelyn', 'Lake', 'Skolowski', 'convicted', 'murderer', 'who', 'happened', 'be', 'attorney', 'Liz', 'can', 'actually', 'kill', 'husband', 'already', 'been', 'convicted', 'murdering', 'anyway', 'provision', 'Constitution', 'Fifth', 'Amendment.Now', 'who', ""'ve"", 'read', 'earlier', 'review', 'Negotiator', 'what', 'may', 'sound', 'familiar', 'action', 'point', 'taken', 'place', 'span', 'half-hour', 'notice', 'nowhere', 'have', 'mentioned', 'character', 'played', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'character', 'Travis', 'Lehman', 'parole', 'officer', 'who', 'portrayed', 'nonsense', 'guy', 'who', ""n't"", 'give', 'second', 'chances.What', 'here', 'end', 'film', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'compare', '1993', 'Fugitive', 'Lehman', 'Liz', 'Washington', 'State', 'Colorado', 'New', 'Orleans', 'trail', 'missing', 'son', 'husband', 'who', 'framed', 'her.This', 'film', 'had', 'potential', 'be', 'great', 'thriller', 'one', 'reason', 'got', 'even', 'two', 'stars', 'was', 'marvelous', 'Hitchcockian', 'sequence', 'New', 'Orleans', 'cemetary', 'was', 'actually', 'pulled', 'off', 'director', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'climatic', 'scene', 'was', 'near-perfect', 'as', 'well', 'What', 'overly', 'contrived', 'script', 'David', 'Weisberg', 'Douglas', 'S.', 'Cook', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'Rock', 'where', 'did', 'much', 'better', 'job', 'Weisberg', 'Cook', 'up', 'situations', 'then', 'do', ""n't"", 'follow', 'own', 'rules', 'So', 'instead', 'taut', 'thriller', 'where', 'wonder', 'how', 'heroine', 'going', 'accomplish', 'tasks', 'whole', 'thing', 'off', 'kind', 'lethargic.Jones', 'journeyman', 'performance', 'Lehman', 'parole', 'officer', 'who', 'realize', 'pursuing', 'innocent', 'woman', 'Judd', 'excellent', 'everything', 'asked', 'times', 'seemed', 'bit', 'subdued', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'imbued', 'Nick', 'kind', 'charm', 'could', 'almost', 'love', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'done', 'wife.I', 'love', 'mysteries', 'wanted', 'highly', 'recommend', 'film', 'end', 'ca', ""n't"", 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'may', 'be', 'OK', 'way', 'spend', 'rainy', 'afternoon', 'view', 'discount', 'movie', 'house', 'rival', 'TV-movie', 'top-notch', 'thriller', ""n't"", 'make', 'grade', 'Originally', 'written', '25', 'September', '1999', ']']",N/A

What this means is that a person can only be accused of someone's murder once, so technically she's free to kill.There's a whole manner of things to make you stop caring about this.  Number one would have to be the ridiculously light view of life on the inside.  When the heroine is locked away she forms deep friendships with her inmates and seems to do a lot of jogging.  A few years and she's out, under the supervision of Tommy Lee Jones (who is basically reprising his role in `The Fugitive').  Of course, finding her husband leads to lots of dumb dead ends, stupid chase scenes and the ultimate dilemma at the end: will she or won't she kill her husband?  The answer is clear in the fact that this was a box office success, and this is just another in a long line of thrillers that should have just gone straight to video.Thankfully though, Ashley Judd is good in the leading role, and there are some mildly impressive special effects.

Then again, if you get your legal know-how from Hollywood, I can pretty much garantee that there's a cell with your name on it at Sing-Sing or San Quentin or one of these country's other fine correctional facilities.  But apart from completely mangling the legal principle of Double Jeopardy, this is a decent thriller film.  Personally, I'll never object if the hero of the plot is actually a heroine and I can think of few, if any, ladies who'd be better suited for the role of this heroine who goes from riches to prison rags when she's convicted for the murder of her husband, for which she claims innocence and where there's no body...considering he's alive and framed her for the crime himself, that makes perfect sense.  Given that this picture has a heroine as opposed to a hero, I am still able to sleep at night knowing that there is no romantic element...unless you count the foe-love that the scheming hubby dishes out in the beginning.  Given that Jud has revenge on the brain, coupled with the knowledge that the law in this film will allow her to get away with her murderous intentions (again, don't try this at home), real romance has no place in this film.  Just let Miss Jud's character worry about getting her son back as he's in the clutches of her no-so-dead husband.  As for Tommy Lee Jones, I always enjoy his work and was anxiously awaiting his arrival on the silver screen...unfortunetly Miss Jud's character had to first be arrested, tried, convicted, sentenced, serve a few years in prison, and be paroled before Mr. Jones could step in as her parole officer...I'll write this set of circumstances off as being just another flaw in our criminal justice system.  Some have said that Mr. Jones's character mirrors his Oscar-winning performance in ""The Fugitive"" where he played a U.S. Marshal on a manhunt for an escaped man who might have possibly been innocent of the murder of which he was convicted (there was a dead body and everything in that one)...I can certainly see the resemblence.  Normally, I'm not a big fan of repeat performances, but if your gonna copy an old role of yours, Sam Gerard in ""The Fugitive"" is a very good choice.  Overall, this is a pretty good film that will keep your attention as it's characters take you across the country so they can accomplish the goal.

Surely this Harvard grad, ex-roomate of Al Gore, would chose an intelligent script in which to appear?  Wrong!  Who knows why Tommy Lee got into this mess.  He looked bored and shame-faced for the entire thing.  In the ""special features"" he tries to come up with something positive to say about the film but all he could muster was ""It has a car chase.""Besides the fact that the basic premise of the script is flawed--that a person can't be convicted for killing the same person twice--the rest of the script is filled with unbelievable and implausible features. There are some excellent one-star reviews here so I won't repeat all of their points.Ashley Judd is very pretty and performs well when she stays within her emotional limitations.  She's great at the Mom and son scenes but fails dreadfully as the supposedly hardened fury, bent on revenge.  The woman who played her ex-lawyer buddy in the pen would have been more credible in that mode.  It's unbelievable that this delicate sweety would pull off the car in the ferry scene or carry off the car chase.If one could could get beyond the basic flaw in the premise, that a person couldn't be tried for double jeopardy, there could be an interesting story here.  Perhaps if the Judd character were  portrayed as someone so naive that she believed what her jailhouse buddy told her, even though we, the audience knew better, then we might follow the script with some interest.

130492,A1J2931UBBJPXM,0792160207,Reviewer,"[5, 6]","Ashley Judd stars as Libby Parsons, a woman out for justice after being wrongly accused of her husband's murder in ""Double Jeopardy,"" a thriller from director Bruce Beresford.  Libby is happily married and living in the  Seattle area with her husband, Nick (Bruce Greenwood), and their  four-year-old son, Matty (Benjamin Weir).  Nick, however, is in big  financial trouble, and they are about to lose everything; and Libby knows  nothing about it.  Under pretense of buying her a boat, Nick takes Libby  sailing, alone.  During the night he disappears, leaving behind evidence of  his apparent murder, and orchestrating it to incriminate Libby.  When she  is convicted and sent to prison, Matty goes to stay with a family friend,  Angela (Annabeth Gish), who disappears with the boy a month later.  Adamant  in her quest to locate Angela by tracking her through a series of phone  numbers, she finally succeeds; and also discovers that Nick is still alive.  And with Angela.  Frustrated in her attempts to get someone to listen to  her story, Libby can do nothing but serve her time, and wait.  After  serving six years in prison, she is paroled, and begins searching for her  son, armed with a useful bit of information she learned on the inside:  The  law of Double Jeopardy; since she's already been convicted of killing her  husband, she cannot be tried for it again, even if she shoots him in front  of a crowd in the middle of Times Square.  She does have one more problem,  though.  Her parole officer, Travis Lehman (Tommy Lee Jones) is out to  track her down for violating her parole, and If he catches her, she'll go  back to prison.  Outstanding performances by Judd and Jones highlight  this film, along with some nice touches by Beresford in keeping the tension  high while moving it along at just the right pace.  Judd makes Libby  believable, infused with a vulnerability and determination that makes you  pull for her; she's a strong woman who's been wronged, and you desperately  want to see her get her life put back together.  Jones is convincing as the  hard-as-nails Lehman, who doesn't see parole as a second chance, but as a  ""last"" chance.  Beneath it all, however, you know that this is a man who  also believes in justice, and will do what he can to make it so.  Greenwood  gives just the right touch of boorishness to Nick; he's like the successful  used-car salesman you never want to have to deal with, and you wait for the  moment when Libby will finally get her crack at him.  The supporting  cast includes Annabeth Gish (Angela), Michael Gaston (Cutter), Roma Maffia  (Margaret) and Davenia McFadden (Evelyn).  In a world in which the unjust  too often prevail, it is gratifying to at least see the attempt made of  putting things to right.  ""Double Jeopardy"" does just that; it takes you on  a wild ride and gives you hope at the same time.  Maybe it's only a movie,  but it's a good one.

Ashley Judd is framed for the murder of her husband, who actually did the framing, and is still alive.  What is worse, while the Judd character is doing hard state prison time, her husband has custody of her son, has assumed a new identity, is living off of $2 million in life insurance proceeds (paid on his own death), and sleeping with Judd's best friend.  Judd discovers all this by happenstance, and is suddenly hating life and most of all hating her husband.Judd gets out of prison on parole and is shortly in pursuit of her erstwhile husband.  All of the foregoing occurs in the first 15 minutes of the film, so these are not spoilers.  The problem becomes Judd's behavior -- it is spectacularly stupid, short-sighted, and unrealistic, not to mention careless.  You can almost justify it by saying that she has lost her sanity (understandable) but the problem is that most of us cannot connect with a protagonist who is 'round the bend.  There are some amusing and interesting parts to this film, but mostly it is a clean miss.  Tommy Lee Jones reprises (almost) his role in The Fugitive by trying to track Judd down (in this flick he is her former parole officer) but really, this part does not really work either.

130498,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,0792160207,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","If &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; succeeds at all as entertainment, it is thanks to two basic elements: the luminous, feisty performance by Ashley Judd and the fact that the story taps into a pair of sure-fire emotional  grabbers - the attempt by a falsely convicted person to prove his or her  innocence and the wrenching spectacle of a mother being unduly separated  from her child.This trite revenge melodrama is, otherwise, a fairly  mediocre piece of pop culture trash, short on solid character development  and long on credibility-defying illogic. Judd plays the wife of a  multimillionaire businessman who is framed for the murder of her husband  (an ersatz murder, by the way, whose logistics are never explained either  to Judd or to the audience), spends six years behind bars and then, when  released, goes in search of not only the husband she now knows is alive and  well but the son whom she has not seen in all that time. Tommy Lee Jones  co-stars as her parole officer who, at first, attempts to inhibit her  search then, becoming convinced of her truthfulness, joins her in her  effort to exact proper revenge.The film sets up its framework on a very  shaky premise. We are expected to believe, idiotically, that Judd is free  to murder her husband for real this time with full impunity, covered by the  double jeopardy legal argument that one cannot be tried twice for the same  crime. Any film that believes its audience is that gullible is unlikely to  win over too many converts. Similarly, are we really to swallow the fact  that a man as professional as Jones' parole officer appears to be would  leave the keys in the ignition while his prisoner sits in the car  handcuffed to the door handle while he goes looking for a cup of coffee?  And would a man who has managed to eliminate two wives so successfully and  establish himself as a pillar of the community under several different  aliases allow himself to be fooled so easily into confessing his crime into  a concealed tape recorder? Such lapses in logic permeate this entire film.The movie does deserve credit for keeping the Judd/Jones relationship a  strictly platonic one, thereby avoiding the romantic cliches that could  truly overwhelm the proceedings. And Jones nicely underplays a role that,  in other directorial hands, might have lent itself to hyperbole and  bombast.All told, however, I'm afraid that one's enjoyment of  &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot; is predicated mostly on how willing one is to  suspend critical judgment and go with the facts as they are presented.  Unfortunately, the film is not tightly edited or suspenseful enough to  allow the audience to ride over all these crests of incredibility. The  result is a watchable, but neither compelling nor memorable, piece of pulp  fiction tripe.",2,dopey thriller,964396800,"07 24, 2000",2000,2791,"['quot', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'quot', 'entertainment', 'thanks', 'two', 'basic', 'elements', 'luminous', 'feisty', 'performance', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'fact', 'story', 'pair', 'sure-fire', 'emotional', 'grabbers', 'attempt', 'falsely', 'convicted', 'person', 'prove', 'innocence', 'wrenching', 'spectacle', 'mother', 'being', 'unduly', 'separated', 'child.This', 'trite', 'revenge', 'melodrama', 'otherwise', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'piece', 'pop', 'culture', 'trash', 'short', 'solid', 'character', 'development', 'long', 'credibility-defying', 'illogic', 'Judd', 'wife', 'multimillionaire', 'businessman', 'who', 'framed', 'murder', 'husband', 'ersatz', 'murder', 'way', 'logistics', 'are', 'never', 'explained', 'either', 'Judd', 'audience', 'six', 'years', 'bars', 'then', 'when', 'released', 'search', 'not', 'only', 'husband', 'now', 'alive', 'well', 'son', 'whom', 'not', 'seen', 'time', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'co-stars', 'parole', 'officer', 'who', 'first', 'attempts', 'inhibit', 'search', 'then', 'becoming', 'convinced', 'truthfulness', 'effort', 'exact', 'revenge.The', 'film', 'up', 'framework', 'very', 'shaky', 'premise', 'are', 'expected', 'believe', 'idiotically', 'Judd', 'free', 'murder', 'husband', 'real', 'time', 'full', 'impunity', 'covered', 'double', 'jeopardy', 'legal', 'argument', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'tried', 'twice', 'same', 'crime', 'film', 'audience', 'gullible', 'unlikely', 'win', 'over', 'too', 'many', 'converts', 'Similarly', 'are', 'really', 'swallow', 'fact', 'man', 'as', 'professional', 'Jones', 'parole', 'officer', 'be', 'would', 'leave', 'keys', 'ignition', 'prisoner', 'sits', 'car', 'handcuffed', 'door', 'handle', 'looking', 'cup', 'coffee', 'would', 'man', 'who', 'managed', 'eliminate', 'two', 'wives', 'so', 'successfully', 'establish', 'pillar', 'community', 'several', 'different', 'aliases', 'allow', 'be', 'fooled', 'so', 'easily', 'confessing', 'crime', 'concealed', 'tape', 'recorder', 'Such', 'lapses', 'logic', 'permeate', 'entire', 'film.The', 'movie', 'deserve', 'credit', 'keeping', 'Judd/Jones', 'relationship', 'strictly', 'platonic', 'one', 'thereby', 'avoiding', 'romantic', 'cliches', 'could', 'truly', 'overwhelm', 'proceedings', 'Jones', 'nicely', 'role', 'other', 'directorial', 'hands', 'might', 'have', 'lent', 'hyperbole', 'bombast.All', 'told', 'however', ""'m"", 'afraid', 'one', 'enjoyment', 'quot', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'quot', 'predicated', 'mostly', 'how', 'willing', 'one', 'suspend', 'critical', 'judgment', 'go', 'facts', 'are', 'presented', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'not', 'tightly', 'edited', 'suspenseful', 'enough', 'allow', 'audience', 'ride', 'crests', 'incredibility', 'result', 'watchable', 'compelling', 'memorable', 'piece', 'pulp', 'fiction', 'tripe']",N/A

First, poor wifey, played by Ashley Judd, is accused and convicted of killing her missing husband, whose body they never found!  Cmon' you mean to tell me she was convicted with circumstantial evidence!?  Then after she spends a couple of years in jail, stewing over what actually happened, one of her cellmates tells her ""Hell, y'all should go out and find and kill your husband cause' you can't be accused of killin' him twice!""  So eventually she breaks out of jail and intends to find her missing husband so she can kill him!  Needless to say, Tommy Lee Jones is hot on her trail.  She follows a trail of evidence that her supposedly dead hubby left behind and finally catches up with him, but soon Tommy Lee Jones catches up with her, and get this, he begins to believe her story that her husband is still alive! (Why, we'll never know).  Once both Tommy Lee and Ashley (I forget the characters' names) catch up with her lousy husband it just gets beyond ridiculous.  Ashley tries hard to be serious, but it's almost laughable.  Tommy Lee puts in his usual tough guy with a heart performance (been there, done that).  The best part of the film is the dead/alive husband played by Bruce Greenwood who does an excellent job at playing the villain (it's a shame that he's not it it more, it's the best part of the film). The movie's plotline is flimsy and the acting (except Bruce, which is why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) is sub-par.

Judd, as ""Libby Parsons"", awakes to find a trail of blood leading from bed to brine and is convicted of her husband's murder.  The evidence is hard to refute.  The two were alone on a yacht off Seattle and the Coast Guard arrives while she stands with a bloody knife in her grasp.  At sentencing, Judd  assigns her son Matthew to family friend, Annabeth Gish.  Gish, however, has an even deeper interest - she's having an affair with Judd's husband Nick [Bruce Greenwood].  Oh, yes.  He's still alive after all!Judd, twigging to Nick's survival, now sets herself a quest.  Advised that she can't be tried twice for the same crime - no ""double jeopardy"" - she becomes a model prisoner.  Eager for parole [nobody keeps a woman incarcerated for husband-murder any more], she exercises with stern intent.  She trains in ways to make an Olympics try-out blush from inadequacy.  Jogging in the rain [in Gig Harbour?], building up her timing, coordination and . . .  The remainder of the film allows Judd to reveal just what she might have picked up in her ""Washington State Correctional"" rehabilitation programme.  She begins to apply them almost as soon as she's placed in a parolee halfway house run by Tommy Lee Jones.Jones, at his best irascible self, lays down the rules for behaviour - otherwise it's ""back inside"".  Judd, burning with desire to retrieve her son, flaunts his regimen immediately and the chase is on!  Judd dodges and twists in one breath-catching scene after another until the pair reaches New Orleans.  What a backdrop for chase scenes!  Wrought-iron grillwork!  Jazz concerts for funerals!  Cemeteries of vast stretches of above-ground tombs for capering around and hiding behind or in!  Judd pursues her son with intense dedication, especially after what she learned of Gish's fate in trusting Greenwood.  The result is a captivating sequence in the cemetery involving both husband and son.  Or does it?  All that exercise at Gig Island proves useful as Judd sheds much of her feminine mystique to become a female Clint Eastwood.  The final confrontation is rife with surprises.That the law actually wouldn't let Judd off scot free for ""killing"" Greenwood twice is almost irrelevant.  This film sparkles with the personalities of Judd and Jones.  Both grace any film they make - together, the result is almost overwhelming.  Jones' droll delivery in tense moments provides the perfect leit motif where needed.  There's not much humour in this story, but Tommy Lee Jones can produce effects that overcome the sombre.  If the improbabilities of plot are ignored and the viewer lets the personalities dominate, this is an enjoyable film.

130516,A3MEGCL9WU0U1R,0792160207,Stephen G. Melvin,"[17, 26]","&quot;Well,&quot; I thought to myself as I went into this movie. &quot;At least this is an original plot.&quot; And that much as true. Unfortunately original plots do not make for great movies, or even good one. In this  improbable caper, Ashley Judd is framed for her husband's murder and sent  to prison only to discover by accident that he has run off with her best  friend. Hellbent on revenge, she escapes from a half-way house where she is  on parole and hunts him down. Of course, she may kill him anywhere,  anytime, because she has already been convicted for his murder and cannot  be tried again for it, thanks to the Sixth Amendment.Though the plot is  original, the action scences and dialougue are the same old cliches seen in  almost every action movie. The courtroom scenes are a mockery. The D.A.  asks Judd's charatcer (who, by the way takes the stand in the trial. I  suppose her attorney never heard of pleading the fifth) &quot;Who killed  your husband then? Pirates? Aliens?&quot; No, Madame D.A., courtroom manner  of that sort is not allowed. Don't belittle the witness. And then after we  are expected to believe she has miraculously discovered her husband set  her, the writers ask us to take another leap of faith and believe that in  just a few short years a woman convicted of premeditated murder will be  sent to a half-way house. In a word, no (and thank goodness they don't, by  the way).Tommy Lee Jones provides the only merit to the entire movie as  a smart alec, alcoholic, down-on-his-luck director of the half-way house  who chases Judd from California to New Orleans. Still, correct me if I am  wrong, but hasn't Jones chased one too many innocent people now. If I am  ever being chased by the police, I want Jones following me, because then I  know somehow I will be declared innocent.All in all, what promises to be  original falls into the same silly gags and stunts of every other action  flick that has ever been made.

The life of Libby Parsons (Ashley Judd) was going perfectly.  She had a beautiful boy with her extremely successful husband (Bruce Greenwood).  While on a second honeymoon trip on their yacht, Libby has her life turned upside down when she realizes that her husband has been murdered.  To make matters even worse, Libby is the only suspect in the case and is charged with murder and sentenced to jail.Knowing that she was not the killer, Libby waits out her time in jail until her parole.  She learns that her son has been taken into custody and suspects that her husband may not even be dead after all.  Her parole officer, the gritty Travis Lehman (played by the dependable Tommy Lee Jones), stays on her like a hawk, but she manages to escape out of his grasp in search of the truth--she knows that her husband is still alive and she will do whatever it takes to get her perfect life back--even if she has to kill her ""dead"" husband.  Lehman stays one step behind her, attempting to catch her before she can do anymore damage.  Judd and Jones are a supremely entertaining pair, but unfortunately they are not together on screen much during the last half of the film.  Greenwood is exceptional as the conniving worm of a husband.  Nothing too special, ""Double Jeopardy"" is a fine film to catch on the television if it pops onto NBC or CBS on the weekends.  Luckily, the film does not spend any time actually debating the validity of the double jeopardy clause--maybe we'll get lucky and that argument will be present in a sequel.",3,Double Jeopardy  (1999),1117584000,"06 1, 2005",2005,1926,"['Director', 'Bruce', 'BeresfordCast', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'Benjamin', 'Weir', 'Jay', 'Brazeau', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood.Running', 'Time', '93', 'minutes.Rated', 'R', 'violence', 'language', 'simulated', 'sex.While', 'not', 'most', 'intelligent', 'original', 'thrillers', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'squeak', 'out', 'as', 'much', 'positive', 'energy', 'fairly', 'mediocre', 'script', 'only', 'adequate', 'direction', 'due', 'solid', 'starring', 'cast', 'life', 'Libby', 'Parsons', 'Ashley', 'Judd', 'was', 'going', 'perfectly', 'had', 'beautiful', 'boy', 'extremely', 'successful', 'husband', 'Bruce', 'Greenwood', 'second', 'honeymoon', 'trip', 'yacht', 'Libby', 'life', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'when', 'husband', 'been', 'murdered', 'make', 'matters', 'even', 'worse', 'Libby', 'only', 'suspect', 'case', 'charged', 'murder', 'sentenced', 'jail.Knowing', 'was', 'not', 'killer', 'Libby', 'out', 'time', 'jail', 'parole', 'son', 'been', 'taken', 'custody', 'husband', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'dead', 'parole', 'officer', 'gritty', 'Travis', 'Lehman', 'played', 'dependable', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'hawk', 'escape', 'grasp', 'search', 'truth', 'husband', 'still', 'alive', 'will', 'do', 'whatever', 'get', 'perfect', 'life', 'back', 'even', 'kill', 'dead', 'husband', 'Lehman', 'one', 'step', 'attempting', 'catch', 'can', 'do', 'anymore', 'damage', 'Judd', 'Jones', 'are', 'supremely', 'entertaining', 'pair', 'unfortunately', 'are', 'not', 'together', 'screen', 'much', 'last', 'half', 'film', 'Greenwood', 'exceptional', 'conniving', 'worm', 'husband', 'Nothing', 'too', 'special', 'Double', 'Jeopardy', 'fine', 'film', 'catch', 'television', 'NBC', 'CBS', 'weekends', 'Luckily', 'film', 'not', 'spend', 'time', 'actually', 'debating', 'validity', 'double', 'jeopardy', 'clause', 'maybe', ""'ll"", 'get', 'lucky', 'argument', 'will', 'be', 'present', 'sequel']",N/A

130536,ADTA83BVV65IS,0792160207,"""vincegerman""","[13, 19]","This movie rests on two key plot elements. Since neither of them work, it falls flat on its face before the end of the first reel. A sociopathic husband fakes his death and frames his wife (Ashley Judd) for his own  murder so that he can then collect two million dollars paid dutifully by a  life insurance company into a trust fund for his little boy. Anyone who's  tried to get two cents via an insurance claim will chuckle at the thought  of a company paying up as the woman convicted for his murder starts her  prison term. But there's worse to come. Inside a curiously friendly women's  penitentiary, and with her full makeup intact, Judd conveniently meets an  ex-lawyer con who informs her that, since she's already been tried for  murder, she could kill her still-very-much alive husband and be immune from  prosecution by claiming double jeopardy, whereby nobody can be tried twice  for the same crime. Hello?  If she subsequently kills her husband, then she  was wrongfully convicted the first time, since there can have been no  crime. No first crime, no double jeopardy. They would throw away the key.But why worry about logic in a formulaic and lazy bubblegum movie like  this? Tommy Lee Jones is asleep throughout. Ashley Judd shows enormous but  barely used potential. Bruce Beresford directs like he's wading through  molasses. Did he even care?  No suspense and no thrills are unpardonable  sins in a movie purporting to be a suspense thriller.

Will this just be a knockoff print? It is not. It is an extremely clear transfer for a DVD. As good as many of my Blu Ray, better than some. I have liked this thriller since first viewing it. Ashley Judd's character is imprisoned for a crime she didn't commit. Keeps trying to get someone to listen, of course no-one does. Is advised to do her time, then she will be free to find the truth. She does her time and is given a ""conditional"" parole. Tommy Lee Jones character, a bitter has been is her probation officer. Sparks inevitably fly, like a piece of metal against an emery stone. Judd escapes probation half way house tracking the truth. Jones a disbeliever, follows, always a minute behind. Until the last act when they have become a single force against the ""perpetrator."" They manage to save each others lives within a couple of minutes. The ending can be a tear jerker if one has lost a child and knows how that feels, then has that child returned unharmed. 5.1 Audio.

Judd plays a woman found guilty of murdering her husband only to discover six years on that he is in fact alive! Tommy Lee Jones plays her parole officer and is also entertaining to watch.  There are a number of tense moments which help keep the film at a watchable pace (eg. the car going overboard, being chased by the police, looking for her son in the graveyard, ending up in a coffin etc etc.  It's quite rare for me to want to see a film twice, but this is one of those films you can watch again and again. I was happy to add it to my library, and it is reasonably priced too.Australia's Bruce Beresford directed this film, and I would say he has done a very impressive job.  The DVD includes a small featurette on the making which is enjoyable to watch. Beresford explains why he filmed some scenes a certain way (eg. Judd's anguish at discovering her husband is still alive).",4,Entertaining,1107043200,"01 30, 2005",2005,996,"['DOUBLE', 'JEOPARDY', 'may', 'seem', 'bit', 'far-fetched', 'places', 'Judd', 'performance', 'make', 'watchable', 'entertaining', 'Judd', 'woman', 'found', 'guilty', 'murdering', 'husband', 'only', 'discover', 'six', 'years', 'fact', 'alive', 'Tommy', 'Lee', 'Jones', 'parole', 'officer', 'also', 'entertaining', 'watch', 'are', 'number', 'tense', 'moments', 'help', 'keep', 'film', 'watchable', 'pace', 'eg', 'car', 'going', 'overboard', 'being', 'chased', 'police', 'looking', 'son', 'graveyard', 'ending', 'up', 'coffin', 'etc', 'etc', 'quite', 'rare', 'want', 'see', 'film', 'twice', 'one', 'films', 'can', 'watch', 'again', 'again', 'was', 'happy', 'add', 'library', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'too.Australia', 'Bruce', 'Beresford', 'directed', 'film', 'would', 'say', 'done', 'very', 'impressive', 'job', 'DVD', 'small', 'featurette', 'making', 'enjoyable', 'watch', 'Beresford', 'why', 'filmed', 'scenes', 'certain', 'way', 'eg', 'Judd', 'anguish', 'discovering', 'husband', 'still', 'alive']",N/A
