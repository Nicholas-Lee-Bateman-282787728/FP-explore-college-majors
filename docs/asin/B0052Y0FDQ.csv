The actors were pretty good but the film had a homemade, shot in 3 days look to it. I was also expecting some gore. Nope, nothing. Pass on this one unless you are a friend of one of the actors. When will these no budget, want-to-be directors realize that not every shot needs to be a close-up.",2,good effort...still crap,1353974400,"11 27, 2012",2012,408,"['were', 'things', '34', 'Devil', 'Hand', '666', 'Killer', '34', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'actors', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'film', 'had', 'homemade', 'shot', '3', 'days', 'look', 'was', 'also', 'expecting', 'gore', 'Nope', 'nothing', 'Pass', 'one', 'are', 'friend', 'one', 'actors', 'When', 'will', 'budget', 'want-to-be', 'directors', 'realize', 'not', 'shot', 'be', 'close-up']",By The Devil's Hand: The 666 Killer

1438237,AVLGELI5Y21FB,B0052Y0FDQ,Sean M. Teague,"[5, 5]","By The Devil's Hands is a departure of sorts for writer/director/actor Christopher Abram whose previous films (The Fanglys, After Sundown) were straight-up horror films.  BTDH is first and foremost a thriller in the guess-who-done-it tradition of Basic Instinct and similar films.I was surprised and entertained by Abram's latest effort, which shows the filmmaker growing in nearly every creative direction.  It isn't easy being an independent filmmaker, especially one who resides far from the Hollywood landscape in Texas.  I am very impressed by what Abram is able to create on a small budget, without sacrifices in story quality.  It reminds me of the kind of roll-up-your-sleeves, innovative style that marked the start of now-famous directors like Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.I don't want to ruin any surprises for those who have yet to see the movie, but suffice it to say, BTDH is worth a look for thriller-seekers.  I can't wait to see what Christopher Abram does next.",5,An Entertaining Who-Done-It,1316131200,"09 16, 2011",2011,989,"['Devil', 'Hands', 'departure', 'sorts', 'writer/director/actor', 'Christopher', 'Abram', 'previous', 'films', 'Fanglys', 'Sundown', 'were', 'straight-up', 'horror', 'films', 'BTDH', 'first', 'foremost', 'thriller', 'guess-who-done-it', 'tradition', 'Basic', 'Instinct', 'similar', 'films.I', 'was', 'surprised', 'entertained', 'Abram', 'latest', 'effort', 'filmmaker', 'growing', 'nearly', 'creative', 'direction', ""n't"", 'easy', 'being', 'independent', 'filmmaker', 'especially', 'one', 'who', 'far', 'Hollywood', 'landscape', 'Texas', 'am', 'very', 'impressed', 'what', 'Abram', 'able', 'create', 'small', 'budget', 'sacrifices', 'story', 'quality', 'kind', 'roll-up-your-sleeves', 'innovative', 'style', 'marked', 'start', 'now-famous', 'directors', 'Robert', 'Rodriguez', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino.I', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'ruin', 'surprises', 'who', 'have', 'yet', 'see', 'movie', 'say', 'BTDH', 'look', 'thriller-seekers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', 'Christopher', 'Abram', 'next']",By The Devil's Hand: The 666 Killer
