If the movie does anything right, it's the ability to try and jerk a tear out of it's audience. It worked on my mom! I was totally skeptical at first-- not a huge Hilary Duff fan --but this is a pretty good movie, despite the facts that it employs every single movie character cliche and (at times) has the cheesiest dialogue ever.Duff plays Terri, who wants to go to a music school in LA. Her brother Paul(played by Jason Ritter-- who's too cute for his own good!) is practically her best friend, he supports her like crazy. Her father doesn't want her to go, but her flaky aunt and cool mom do. When Terri's brother is killed in a car accident, she's not sure she wants to sing anymore, and dad certainly doesn't want her going away to a music school. So when Terri is accepted, her mom and aunt cover her back so she can go. Paul would've wanted her to go. She meets a cute guy (Oliver James, in the same role he played in What a Girl Wants), a cool teacher (John Corbett!), and makes some cool friends. Can she overcome her grieving to perform in front of the crowd and sing her heart out?? Will she win the $10,000 scholarship that the music school offers to the best performance? Take a wild guess... hey, it might just surprise you. (But if you pay attention it probably won't. That's okay, though!!)The emotion is there-- that of a grieving sister and family. It's well played; I ALMOST cried (I held it in!). The dialogue is so bad in some spots, but funny and original in others. It seemed to yo-yo back and forth. It's a cute movie for teen girls, they'll swoon over Oliver James, and a pretty good movie for anyone else who can see past the cliches (I did) and just enjoy the movie. Of course it's going to be cheesy sometimes, but that's the charm! Check this one out sometime!!

I think that there needs to be better messages sent to todays teens. Duffs last movie ""A Cinderella Story"" has her dating a 25 year old. What is that teaching kids.

872943,A3T8G3FN3H3948,B0006SSMWE,bryhil_04,"[6, 8]","Before I always said, Hilary is a good actress, but I never really believed, I just thought she was all right, but holy crap, she just proved to me that what I said was totally wrong, she's an amazing actress. I mean, after the first fifteen minutes, or after the incident, how she reacted, it broke my heart and I cried uncontrably. I was like, ""Don't cry, there's people around."" but I couldn't help myself. To see her so broken hearted like that, it was simply some of the best acting I've ever seen. Hilary finally proves she belongs there, and I'm going to be looking forward to seeing more from this girl. Also, it's satisfying to finally see her playing a character that she is actually like, the snotty teen but nice is good for a while, she's good at doing that, but she's much better at being somebody like herself; sweet, shy and outgoing. You know, Terri is Hilary, except for the lying, that's kinda added in there.The Plot: 5/5 Terri is accepted into one of the best colleges for music in the US, located in Los Angelas but her father won't let her go because he stayed back when he was accepted into one of the best football colleges because he wanted to take care of the restaurant instead. His friend decided to go and it didn't work out for him, but Terri's aunt said that if her father did go, he would have made it, but he didn't go. So, therefor, he was completely against Terri's leaving. But, her mother and aunt want what's best for Terri, so they lie to her father, as he tries to make sure she's in good hands, she's away in LA, trying to live her dream, but she's already lost something, and it bugs her throughout the movie.And to me, it should, if something that bad happens, like losing someone that close to her, it would be mentioned throughout the movie, and it would bother her a lot. The movie earns a lot of points, plot wise.Acting: 4/5 Hilary Duff is simply amazing, and the rest of the cast tags along fine.Characters: 4/5 Terri sometimes lies, when she has to, but she has hardly any self-confidence and I think that reflects a lot of people these days. She's sweet, which makes her very likeable, and she's very shy, which also makes her likeable. The father, though he may be overbearing, and aggressive, he only means to protect his daughter, and you end up kind of liking him. Her mother and aunt have kind of the same personality, very caring and nice.Cheesyness- 4.5/5 It's not very cheesy, which is good. It's actually very realistic and for the most part, it makes sense.The performance goes to Hilary for shining so bright. She's such a talented actress, praise, praise... a heartfelt movie, it's great!!",5,I'll give them all to Hilary,1097884800,"10 16, 2004",2004,2653,"['always', 'said', 'Hilary', 'good', 'actress', 'never', 'really', 'believed', 'just', 'thought', 'was', 'right', 'holy', 'crap', 'just', 'proved', 'what', 'said', 'was', 'totally', 'wrong', 'amazing', 'actress', 'mean', 'first', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'incident', 'how', 'reacted', 'broke', 'heart', 'cried', 'uncontrably', 'was', 'Do', ""n't"", 'cry', 'people', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'see', 'so', 'broken', 'hearted', 'was', 'simply', 'best', 'acting', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'Hilary', 'finally', 'there', ""'m"", 'going', 'be', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'more', 'girl', 'Also', 'satisfying', 'finally', 'see', 'playing', 'character', 'actually', 'like', 'snotty', 'teen', 'nice', 'good', 'while', 'good', 'doing', 'much', 'better', 'being', 'somebody', 'sweet', 'shy', 'outgoing', 'know', 'Terri', 'Hilary', 'lying', 'kinda', 'added', 'there.The', 'Plot', '5/5', 'Terri', 'accepted', 'one', 'best', 'colleges', 'music', 'US', 'located', 'Los', 'Angelas', 'father', 'wo', ""n't"", 'let', 'go', 'stayed', 'back', 'when', 'was', 'accepted', 'one', 'best', 'football', 'colleges', 'wanted', 'take', 'care', 'restaurant', 'instead', 'friend', 'decided', 'go', 'did', ""n't"", 'work', 'out', 'Terri', 'aunt', 'said', 'father', 'did', 'go', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'So', 'therefor', 'was', 'completely', 'Terri', 'leaving', 'mother', 'aunt', 'want', 'what', 'best', 'Terri', 'lie', 'father', 'make', 'sure', 'good', 'hands', 'away', 'LA', 'trying', 'live', 'dream', 'already', 'lost', 'something', 'movie.And', 'should', 'something', 'bad', 'losing', 'someone', 'close', 'would', 'be', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'would', 'bother', 'lot', 'movie', 'lot', 'points', 'plot', 'wise.Acting', '4/5', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'simply', 'amazing', 'rest', 'cast', 'tags', 'fine.Characters', '4/5', 'Terri', 'sometimes', 'when', 'hardly', 'self-confidence', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'days', 'sweet', 'very', 'likeable', 'very', 'shy', 'also', 'likeable', 'father', 'may', 'be', 'overbearing', 'aggressive', 'only', 'protect', 'daughter', 'end', 'up', 'kind', 'liking', 'mother', 'aunt', 'have', 'kind', 'same', 'personality', 'very', 'caring', 'nice.Cheesyness-', '4.5/5', 'not', 'very', 'cheesy', 'good', 'actually', 'very', 'realistic', 'most', 'part', 'sense.The', 'performance', 'Hilary', 'shining', 'so', 'bright', 'such', 'talented', 'actress', 'praise', 'praise', 'heartfelt', 'movie', 'great']",N/A

Terri is 16, and has been through a lot recently, and all she wants to do is go to this music school for the summer, but her dad doesn't want her to. All you want in life is for your parents to be supportive of your good decisions you make in life. Hilary did her best in this movie, hands down this is her best performance in a movie to date.

872959,A25GQD0VCUU16V,B0006SSMWE,"Joseph ""JoMo""","[1, 1]","Ok, first things first.  My only problem with Hilary Duff is that it appears all her characters are the same.  Each is the good girl who is trying to find her way while trying to get out of the shadow of the mean people in society (i.e. The Lizzie McGuire Movie, Cinderella Story, and now Raise Your Voice.)  But that doesn't always make a bad movie, and this is a good example.  Raise Your Voice, though it wont change people's Hilary opinion, is a fun family flick that will leave many with a smile as big as Hilary'sTerri Fletrcher (Hilary) is the small town girl who has a talent for singing and everyone around her sees it, especially her brother who is played by Jason Ritter (and let me unprofessionaly say that he is probably one of the sexiest men I've ever seen,) who sent in a DVD of her to a three week summer music program in LA, that of course being without Terri knowing.  The only problem being that her Dad Simon doesn't want her going, him being an overprotective father who wants to shelter her from the ""LA Scene"".  Well the two are forced to sneek out to see a Three Days Concert (I love inner-promotion) because Jason's character spoke up for Terri to the obnoxious close minded father and wound up grounded.  On the trip back there is a car crash which kills Jason Ritter.  A little while later she gets an acceptance letter saying she was accepted to the music camp, and her Mother Frances and Aunt Nina sneak her in covering it up with lie to the father saying she is staying with her aunt that month.She gets there, and of course falls for the English boy Jay and is bullied by the snotty and popular Robin who both have a been there and were ivolved with each other the previous summer.  She quickly makes friends with her roomate Deniese and Kiwi, and also hooks Kiwi up with the ""gothic"" Salone.  And durring this she will grow as a singer and of course after some trials of self belief and unfaithfulness on Jay's behalf she falls in love and the two end up dueting for the $10,000 scholarship that will be awarded to the most talented student.  Her dad quickly catches on and then he comes to pick her up on the last day of school.  Now either he will a.) pick her up and force her home or b.) accept his daughter for the talent she is and let her.  And when he comes to pick her up, there she is, on stage performing her solo.  So the answer is of course A.Here are the lows of the story.  Her father's acting job is beyond horrid.  I swear, student actors in highschool can do better.  It manages to cover every stereotype in the planet.  And in the end credits takes place a big musical finale as she sings ""Jericho"", which she manages to sing over the instruments with no help of a mic at all (which anyone who knows Duff's vocal range will know that'd be near impossible.)But on the plus side the scholarship went to someone who deserved it and in the end you can't help but smile.  The movie is a good movie that even my grandma who is 55 enjoyed.  Duff's acting skills have evolved over time since her Lizzie McGuire days, and you can't help but fall in love with her character.  Terri Fletcher's voice (Hilary's at her best) is pretty, though how her brother could say ""it's the best voice I've ever heard"" is beyond a mystery.  This remains to be her best film yet.

872961,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0006SSMWE,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[23, 35]","There was a moment near the end of ""Raise Your Voice"" where I was wondering how low this 2004 film was going to go.  The main setting for the story is a three-week music camp for gifted youngsters in Los Angeles, which ends with the students performing and the awarding of a $10,000 scholarship.  I was worried that the script was going to follow all of the other clich&#65533;s that riddle the story, but they actually gave the scholarship to the person who deserved it.  This would be one of the few high notes in a film that has trouble finding an original voice.Terri Fletcher (Hilary Duff) is a young, vivacious and talented singer (i.e., Hilary Duff at her best).  Then there is a family tragedy (Jason Ritter really needs to start turning down scripts that have getting into cars), and Terri becomes a shadow of her former self.  However, she gets accepted to the aforementioned music camp and goes off to see what she can do.  There is a problem in that her father, Simon (David Keith) refuses to let her go, which requires her mother, Frances (Rita Wilson) and her Aunt Nina (Rebecca De Mornay), to conspire behind her father's back to get her to the camp (collectively the talents of these three adults are wasted in this film).  Simon is an angry man and while the film suggests there are psychological reasons for him being the way he is the character is reduced to an angry stereotype.  His wife, his sister, his son, and his daughter all come up with valid reasons for him to bring his head back to where the sun shines, but the script by Sam Schreiber, based on the story by Mitch Rotter, does not allow anything to get through his thick skull until the big finale (note that even then he makes his daughter shut up so that he can speak).At the music camp Terri has trouble fitting in.  She is talented and open and the others are talented and tend not to work well with others.  Her roommate, Denise Gilmore (Dana Davis), does some really interesting things with a violin, but was apparently hoping to have the room to herself.  Then there is Robin Childers (Lauren C. Mayhew), who was the Queen B at last summer's camp and assumes everything has stayed the same, making a point of telling people in case they thinking music has something to do with talent or personality.  Then there is Jay Corgan (Oliver James), who has an English accent to go with the guitar case that is usually strung across his shoulder.  He seems a decent sort, who treats Terri like she was as human being (it probably has something to do with the English accent).  Robin thinks Jay is still her consort, which gives her another reason to hate Terri.  There is also the fact that Terri is this summer's teacher's pet for the school's cool teacher (John Corbett).Although so much of this film is predictable, my biggest complaint is that one of the sub-plots never gets to its payoff.  The choir class is working on ""The Hallelujah Chorus"" from Handel's ""Messiah.""  Terri is given a solo, which is just another reason to Robin to be miffed (the movie is rated PG so I am trying to temper my language accordingly).  Terri is struggling to be freed from the shackles of overwhelming psychological guilt so that her voice can take flight again.  There are several scenes of the class working on this song, with and without Terri.  But is there a scene where they stand up and sing the song?  Why, no, there is not.  It seems that Terri has been working on another song, with Jay, that he had written (she helps with the words), and that is much more in the musical vein that Duff is known for singing (although she does tackle an aria from ""Don Giovanni"" to show she is game).Director Sean McNamara seems to have been inspired by the movie ""Fame,"" which is a pretty good movie to be inspired by if you are doing this sort of genre where people are legitimately bursting into song and the instruments behind the singers can actually be seen on the screen.  But that means the best scenes of this film seem rather derivative of Alan Parker's 1980 film and it seems rather counterproductive to make Hilary Duff part of the gang.  In fact, I was thinking that ""Raise Your Voice"" might work better if it did not star Hilary Duff.  I read that Evan Rachel Wood and Jonathan Jackson were the original choices for the young leads, and that only confirms my working hypothesis.  Duff is okay in the role.  She has a nice smile and when she has to cry she puts a lot into it, but she is not an actress on the same level of Wood, who I think is more talented than Duff and Lindsey Lohan combined.  Unfortunately the current generation of young movie goers is being asked to choose only between those two teen queens.",3,Hilary Duff tries to sing her way out of all the cliches,1108598400,"02 17, 2005",2005,4693,"['was', 'moment', 'end', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'where', 'was', 'wondering', 'how', 'low', '2004', 'film', 'was', 'going', 'go', 'main', 'setting', 'story', 'three-week', 'music', 'camp', 'gifted', 'youngsters', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'students', 'performing', 'awarding', '10,000', 'scholarship', 'was', 'worried', 'script', 'was', 'going', 'follow', 'other', 'clich', '65533', 's', 'story', 'actually', 'gave', 'scholarship', 'person', 'who', 'deserved', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'few', 'high', 'notes', 'film', 'trouble', 'finding', 'original', 'voice.Terri', 'Fletcher', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'young', 'vivacious', 'talented', 'singer', 'i.e.', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'best', 'Then', 'family', 'tragedy', 'Jason', 'Ritter', 'really', 'start', 'turning', 'down', 'scripts', 'have', 'getting', 'cars', 'Terri', 'shadow', 'former', 'self', 'However', 'accepted', 'aforementioned', 'music', 'camp', 'off', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do', 'problem', 'father', 'Simon', 'David', 'Keith', 'let', 'go', 'mother', 'Frances', 'Rita', 'Wilson', 'Aunt', 'Nina', 'Rebecca', 'De', 'Mornay', 'conspire', 'father', 'back', 'get', 'camp', 'collectively', 'talents', 'three', 'adults', 'are', 'wasted', 'film', 'Simon', 'angry', 'man', 'film', 'are', 'psychological', 'reasons', 'being', 'way', 'character', 'reduced', 'angry', 'stereotype', 'wife', 'sister', 'son', 'daughter', 'come', 'up', 'valid', 'reasons', 'bring', 'head', 'back', 'where', 'sun', 'shines', 'script', 'Sam', 'Schreiber', 'based', 'story', 'Mitch', 'Rotter', 'not', 'allow', 'anything', 'get', 'thick', 'skull', 'big', 'finale', 'note', 'even', 'then', 'daughter', 'shut', 'up', 'so', 'can', 'speak', '.At', 'music', 'camp', 'Terri', 'trouble', 'fitting', 'talented', 'open', 'others', 'are', 'talented', 'tend', 'not', 'work', 'well', 'others', 'roommate', 'Denise', 'Gilmore', 'Dana', 'Davis', 'really', 'interesting', 'things', 'violin', 'was', 'apparently', 'hoping', 'have', 'room', 'herself', 'Then', 'Robin', 'Childers', 'Lauren', 'C.', 'Mayhew', 'who', 'was', 'Queen', 'B', 'last', 'summer', 'camp', 'everything', 'stayed', 'same', 'making', 'point', 'telling', 'people', 'case', 'thinking', 'music', 'something', 'do', 'talent', 'personality', 'Then', 'Jay', 'Corgan', 'Oliver', 'James', 'who', 'English', 'accent', 'go', 'guitar', 'case', 'usually', 'strung', 'shoulder', 'decent', 'sort', 'who', 'Terri', 'was', 'human', 'being', 'probably', 'something', 'do', 'English', 'accent', 'Robin', 'Jay', 'still', 'consort', 'reason', 'hate', 'Terri', 'also', 'fact', 'Terri', 'summer', 'teacher', 'pet', 'school', 'cool', 'teacher', 'John', 'Corbett', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'predictable', 'biggest', 'complaint', 'one', 'sub-plots', 'never', 'payoff', 'choir', 'class', 'working', 'Hallelujah', 'Chorus', 'Handel', 'Messiah', 'Terri', 'given', 'solo', 'just', 'reason', 'Robin', 'be', 'miffed', 'movie', 'rated', 'PG', 'am', 'trying', 'temper', 'language', 'accordingly', 'Terri', 'struggling', 'be', 'freed', 'shackles', 'overwhelming', 'psychological', 'guilt', 'voice', 'can', 'take', 'flight', 'again', 'are', 'several', 'scenes', 'class', 'working', 'song', 'Terri', 'there', 'scene', 'where', 'stand', 'up', 'sing', 'song', 'Why', 'not', 'Terri', 'been', 'working', 'song', 'Jay', 'had', 'written', 'words', 'much', 'more', 'musical', 'vein', 'Duff', 'known', 'singing', 'tackle', 'aria', 'Don', 'Giovanni', 'show', 'game', '.Director', 'Sean', 'McNamara', 'have', 'been', 'inspired', 'movie', 'Fame', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie', 'be', 'inspired', 'are', 'doing', 'sort', 'genre', 'where', 'people', 'are', 'legitimately', 'bursting', 'song', 'instruments', 'singers', 'can', 'actually', 'be', 'seen', 'screen', 'best', 'scenes', 'film', 'seem', 'rather', 'derivative', 'Alan', 'Parker', '1980', 'film', 'rather', 'counterproductive', 'make', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'part', 'gang', 'fact', 'was', 'thinking', 'Raise', 'Your', 'Voice', 'might', 'work', 'better', 'did', 'not', 'star', 'Hilary', 'Duff', 'read', 'Evan', 'Rachel', 'Wood', 'Jonathan', 'Jackson', 'were', 'original', 'choices', 'young', 'leads', 'only', 'working', 'hypothesis', 'Duff', 'okay', 'role', 'nice', 'smile', 'when', 'cry', 'lot', 'not', 'actress', 'same', 'level', 'Wood', 'who', 'think', 'more', 'talented', 'Duff', 'Lindsey', 'Lohan', 'combined', 'Unfortunately', 'current', 'generation', 'young', 'movie', 'goers', 'being', 'asked', 'choose', 'only', 'two', 'teen', 'queens']",N/A
872962,A3BMYITM04WG3X,B0006SSMWE,LFotF,"[3, 4]","This movie is great from beginning to end.Hilary Duff shines at her very brightest in this outstanding motion picture. Her acting is her best yet, and her singing is top-notch. She brings the house down with ""Someone to Watch Over Me,"" ""Jericho,"" and her hit single ""Fly."" She doesn't disappoint her fans and is sure to win over nearly every viewer of this movie.The supporting cast is great. John Corbett is excellent as always as Hilary's teacher. Oliver James who previously starred in ""What a Girl Wants"" gets a better role and handles it like a pro. I had never seen Jason Ritter before, but I will be looking for his movies from now on. His portrayal of Hilary's brother is truly great!The story is actually quite dramatic. This should not be classified with ""Duff Fluff."" The basic story is about a girl who has a tragedy in her life and tries to come to grips with it while attending a summer music program. The story is a lot more detailed than that, but I don't want to include any spoilers. It sounds corny, but it comes off as very believable and genuine. There are light moments too, but the overall feel is that of a drama.So, if it has a luminous star, cool music, great support, and a truly above-average story, why do so many people hate it? There are two main reasons.The first is the star. Hilary Duff has a lot of people who hate her. A quick search of the internet reveals dozens of sights bashing her in the crudest terms. I have heard nearly every interview she has ever done and several other interviews where other people talked about her. She is always cheerful and sweet. So, why the bashing? BECAUSE SHE ISN'T A TRAMP! Every performance she has given (and I've just about seen them all) has been completely clean. Her music videos are absolutely the cleanest on MTV in the past decade. A lot of people want tramps. That is why another former Disney star whom we all know has put out a video lately that's going to give Britney a run for her money. I, for one, don't think an actress should be hated because she ISN'T a tramp.The other reason is very similar. The movie itself is very clean. The PG rating turns a lot of people off. Aside from one scene involving teenage drinking, this movie is very clean and has a positive message on dealing with grief. There is no sex, no violence, and only a little very mild language. I'm not saying that any movie that's PG-13 or R is trash; I'm just saying that there is no reason to skip a great movie just because it's clean.Overall, this movie is a fantastic experience for everyone over about 10 or so. (I only say this because there are some ""Thematic Elements"" that might bother small children.) So, grab your family and watch ""Raise Your Voice.""

I think Hilary is cute and all, but her acting needs a lot of work and surprisingly her voice sounded weaker than ever here.  If she's supposed to be a real life singer, then how come her solo parts in her music class were dubbed?  She looked totally uncomfortable whenever she was singing.  As a musical performer, she should appear relaxed and natural.  And even in non singing scenes, she looks so self-concious.  Why? - she's gorgeous.  If she'd stop shaking her head so much, then we wouldn't get eye-sores watching her.  I was also shocked at how poor the acting in general was.  Rita Wilson and John Corbett.  What were you thinking??  The only things for me that partially saved this from being completely cheesy and slit-your-throat-ish, was that even while the story line was predictable, it was a little moving, and there were some great scenes of Los Angeles in it (my favourite city).  I do think Hilary is more prone to a Lizzie McGuire type role until she gets acting classes.  She's trying too hard to be more mature than she really is.  I did like though, having the video for Fly at the end as a special feature.  It is actually a song of hers I do quite like.PS I didn't realise until this role, just how much Jason Ritter looks EXACTLY like his late great dad, John Ritter.",3,Um ...

Many just depict it as being too cheesy and silly, but when it is viewed by its audience as the lighthearted and enjoyable fluff that it is, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.""Raise Your Voice,"" stars the infamous Hilary Duff as Terri Fletcher, a 16-year-old girl with a gift for singing and performing. Nobody supports her more than her loving older brother Paul, her only sibling, who is determined to make sure his little sister goes as far as she can. Tragedy strikes the family early in the movie, and with barely enough time to grieve, Terri is accepted into a prestigious music school for the summer, and her mother and aunt are dead-set on making sure she accepts the rare opportunity. Terri wants to go, of course, but with her extremely overprotective father clinging to her harder than ever, the three women may have to conspire together in order to make it happen. So begins Terri's solo trip to LA to pursue her dream, and as she deals with snarky classmates, boys, and overwhelming expectations from teachers, she is also fighting to cope with the pain and guilt of moving on without the one person who believed in her more than anyone else.This movie has often been likened to ""Brave New Girl,"" a film spawned from Britney and Lynne Spears' co-written book, but this film had its differences. Unlike the title character in ""Brave New Girl,"" Terri Fletcher did not have to change her voice or style to reel in the people at her music school. They liked her for the girl in her application video, and what came out was HER, not somebody who had to conform.It is true that this film is one of Hilary Duff's most emotional and well-executed roles. One thing I really like about this girl is that she knows who she is as an actress, and she plays to that personal style without ever trying to be anything different. She doesn't try to act like she's 30; she's a teenager, a kid, and that's the vibe she still projects in her acting, even though she has clearly grown and changed so much since her initial breakout as an innocent little middle schooler in Disney's ""Lizzie McGuire."" There is something very commendable to be said about that. Playing the role of a sweet, innocent, and hard-working young girl suits Duff well, and even as she gets older and branches out to more complex material, I think she will always be one of the special ones. You may love her or hate her, but few can deny that she is one of the better role models in today's world of countless female teen actresses.As for Duff's love interest Oliver James...I remember seeing him in ""What a Girl Wants"" alongside Amanda Bynes, and I don't really care for him much, but the scenes between him and Hilary were still good. Everyone did a nice job with their roles, and you may even recognize Terri's father Simon as the dad in ""The Parent Trap""--not the Lindsay Lohan version, mind you, but the one way back when with Hayley Mills.""Raise Your Voice"" is a breath of fresh air and the perfect film for its personal audience to watch. We all know what a ""chick flick"" is, and we all know what sweet fluff is, so if you don't like either of those things, then you really have no reason to watch this movie.

I certainly never expected to actually like it.Now I'll admit, I'm just as lust-crazed over the divine Miz Duff as the next red-blooded male (deal with it, folks, she's 18 now and we're allowed), but I'll also be the first to admit that she's not a world-class actress. It's almost as if someone gave her melodrama lessons. Hopefully she'll grow out of it as she gets farther into her acting career and gets away from Nickelodeon veterans like McNamara, who encourage such behavior (it seems to appeal to their target audience, e.g. my daughter). Were this a Hilary Duff vehicle, it would have probably gone down in flames pretty fast. It works, however, because McNamara had the presence of mind to realize he was directing a theatrical release and had to appeal to a wider audience-- something few TV directors seem capable of. Thus, he surrounded Duff with an ensemble of talent that, while mostly unknown at this point, will not stay so for long. About the biggest names in the movie, aside from Duff's, are lent by John Corbett (Northern Exposure), David Keith (If...Dog...Rabbit... and more Sci-Fi originals than you can shake a stick at), and Rebecca DeMornay (Risky Business). The rest are promising rising stars who can actually act, headed up by Oliver James (What a Girl Wants), Dana Davis (Coach Carter), Johnny Lewis (Underclassman), and Kat Dennings (The 40 Year Old Virgin), all of whom fit the same young-and-beautiful profile as Duff. Lewis, especially, will be going places; he has an infectious enthusiasm for his character (and, one surmises, his work) that causes him to steal every scene he's in.Do you need a plot synopsis? Duff meets voice. Duff loses voice. Etc. There's some stuff about her family (done far better in the recent The Safety of Objects), some incredibly bad taste in music exhibited, and a lot of extraneous fluff, but the core of the movie could well become a guilty pleasure for Duffophiles. ***",3,"It's actually not that bad.

It's no ""Fame"" but surely the kind of movie that you'd stop flicking channels for.",4,FEEL-GOOD HOOEY THAT'S ACTUALLY QUITE PLEASANT,1110758400,"03 14, 2005",2005,1352,"['Disclaimer', ""'m"", 'insignificant', 'statistical', 'minority', 'human', 'population', 'circa', '97', '%', ""n't"", 'much', 'care', 'Ms.', 'Duff', 'tetchy', 'voice', 'lyrics.Fortunately', ""n't"", 'get', 'way', 'enjoying', 'confidently-produced', 'star', 'vehicle', 'even', 'fuel', 'unabashed', 'cliches.The', 'script', 'must', 'surely', 'have', 'come', 'tin-can', 'clearly', 'marked', ""'Chickflick"", 'small', 'town', 'girl', 'big', 'dreams', 'defies', 'controlling', 'father', 'get', 'LA', 'toughest-cookie', 'music', 'school', 'confounding', 'competition', ""n't"", 'believe', 'then', 'butt', 'poignant', 'moment', 'triumph', 'point', 'impoverished', 'African', 'American', 'girlfriend', 'goodies', 'instead', 'hey', 'who', 'was', 'experience', ""'re"", 'much', 'richer', 'now', 'thanks', 'lights', 'out', 'see', 'ya', 'next', 'year.Thrown', 'fray', 'are', 'choice', 'cardboard', 'characters', 'not', 'least', 'whom', 'Ms.', 'Duff', 'cutie-pie', 'love', 'interest', 'England', 'who', 'bashful', 'piano', 'pieces', 'solitude', 'being', 'man', 'block', 'daytime', 'John', 'Corbett', 'pitches', 'effortless', 'performance', 'professor', 'who', 'protagonist', 'evident', 'reason.Yet', 'out', 'endurably', 'end', 'character', 'spirited', 'being', 'here', 'Fame', 'surely', 'kind', 'movie', ""'d"", 'stop', 'flicking', 'channels']",N/A

While at the music school she makes friends,falls in love and slowly starts to gain back confidence. Terri and Jay (the boy she falls in love with) decide to try and win the scholarship together (they write together).

I bought a used copy of the DVD and I am very impressed with it. It plays like a charm - no pauses or skips anywhere. Very good quality for the price!Also, this has to be one of Hilary Duff's most charming roles. Duff portrays Terri, a girl who moves to L.A. to follow her dreams of making it big. As Terri follows her heart, she discovers that if she is true to herself, she will go far in life.

However, it's very inspiring when you see how Terri Fletcher doesn't give up music and goes to the music school.  It's funny in places, too.  Yes, this is a film that's family friendly, which is quite usual for Hilary Duff.
