1516892,A2J9O66NT1GRNM,B006KH6D7Q,Amazon Customer,"[7, 8]",I understand this was a student film and had a ridiculously small budget and they did some amazing things with that budget.  The CGI effects are better than many SYFY productions.  The acting could use some fine tuning but I think that and the props all fall under the ridiculously small budget.  I was impressed by the number of times  the super beings used their powers and the basic story is sound though the dialogue and and few points along the way could use some tweaks.I would very much like to see the potential reached for this film maker.,3,Intriguing,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",2013,548,"['understand', 'was', 'student', 'film', 'had', 'ridiculously', 'small', 'budget', 'did', 'amazing', 'things', 'budget', 'CGI', 'effects', 'are', 'better', 'many', 'SYFY', 'productions', 'acting', 'could', 'use', 'fine', 'tuning', 'think', 'props', 'fall', 'ridiculously', 'small', 'budget', 'was', 'impressed', 'number', 'times', 'super', 'beings', 'used', 'powers', 'basic', 'story', 'sound', 'dialogue', 'few', 'points', 'way', 'could', 'use', 'tweaks.I', 'would', 'very', 'much', 'see', 'potential', 'reached', 'film', 'maker']",Bomb Squad

The story is nearly great. The roles make sense. And best of all, the superheroes are slightly-off center. This is what Stan Lee aims for even to this day.There is just too much to like about Bomb Squad. It takes all the ordinary superhero tropes&#8212;kids getting powers, adversaries who are military, next step in evolution&#8212;and reworks the recipe into something homespun but excellent.While the actors were clearly friends who came along for the ride and director was far more interested in getting the story across than drawing out range from the cast, the story is so strong that it carries the entire production. In fact, by the story's end, Bomb Squad's production quality becomes part of its attraction: I knew how it was going to look, I just wanted to see how it was going to unfold.This is the kind of film I'd like see redone as a Hollywood blockbuster.",5,A+ for Bomb Squad.

OK, it was extremely low budget, but I have seen similar privately done films that led to a second film, and then a third, and before long the movies were being shown in theaters and picked up by major film companies. I almost turned it off at the beginning, but it drew me in just enough to keep watching, and it got better as it went. Yes, the special effects don't measure up to the multimillion dollar productions, but they were a lot better than some of the B Grade movies I have seen - and if you grew up watching things like the original Godzilla films they may make you a little nostalgic.

On their way out they encounter the evil Wraith, a man in a black cloak hoodie and a cheap demon voice echo enhancer...oooooh scary, Darth Maul move over. These guys all have special powers, i.e. stop bullets, create fire, create lightning, and influence people with their glow in the dark contacts.The movie shifts to 8 years later. Two of the Freeman kids visit super dad in prison and he imparts some of his power to them who in turn touch their siblings who also get power, turning them into a mini &#34;Fantastic Four&#34; to the dismay of their doting mother. It is during their visit he recaps the plot, leaving a lot of stuff out so we feign interest. The acting was extremely bad. The plot reminded me of something I saw in an X-Men movie, with Uncle Sam hunting down the mutants. Bianca Freeman (Erin Kupay), who appears she might of had a year of drama studies, is the closet thing to an actor in this film. The title &#34;Bomb Squad&#34; is from a virtual game one of the pimply faced boys play. He wanted to call his group the &#34;Bomb Squad&#34; with cool, if not meaningless nicknames, but no one else wanted yo go along.
