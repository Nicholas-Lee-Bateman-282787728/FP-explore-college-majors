501044,A1PMDTYRAIPGXW,B00000G3A6,Adam P Boots,"[17, 21]","Get A Life was literally so far ahead of it's time it only lasted 3 seasons, and part of me is AMAZED that it lasted that long.  Vol 1 only encompasses 4 of the 36 original Get A Life episodes, and though the 4 it does have are damned funny, they're not worth $10 a peice to own.It seems like everyone I know remembers the misadventures of the 30+ year old Paperboy with the title track of ""Stand"" by REM.  And almost all of them kind of wonder ""what the hell happened to that show?"" OR they wonder ""what the hell was that show all about?"".Basically, the show was the father figure to such weird, off based shows such as Malcolm In The Middle or Arrested Development, because it uses a very dark, twisted ""what the hell?"" kind of humor that is only believeable in television, but all together hilarious.  If you think Arrested Development was ""ahead of it's time"" (critics claimed this regularly) then that would be Get A Life would be the equivilent to a Caveman holding a quarter pounder, a flashlight, and a glock with a laser sight.This show was great and needs to be re-issued on DVD (preferrably in 12 episode, FULL SEASON, DVD's)",4,Unfortunately short and comparitively not worth the money,1138147200,"01 25, 2006",2006,1136,"['Get', 'Life', 'was', 'literally', 'so', 'far', 'ahead', 'time', 'only', 'lasted', '3', 'seasons', 'part', 'AMAZED', 'lasted', 'long', 'Vol', '1', 'only', '4', '36', 'original', 'Get', 'A', 'Life', 'episodes', '4', 'have', 'are', 'damned', 'funny', ""'re"", 'not', 'worth', '10', 'peice', 'own.It', 'everyone', 'know', 'misadventures', '30+', 'year', 'old', 'Paperboy', 'title', 'track', 'Stand', 'REM', 'almost', 'kind', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'happened', 'show', 'wonder', 'what', 'hell', 'was', 'show', '.Basically', 'show', 'was', 'father', 'figure', 'such', 'weird', 'off', 'based', 'shows', 'such', 'Malcolm', 'Middle', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'very', 'dark', 'twisted', 'what', 'hell', 'kind', 'humor', 'only', 'believeable', 'television', 'together', 'hilarious', 'think', 'Arrested', 'Development', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'critics', 'claimed', 'regularly', 'then', 'would', 'be', 'Get', 'Life', 'would', 'be', 'equivilent', 'Caveman', 'holding', 'quarter', 'pounder', 'flashlight', 'glock', 'laser', 'sight.This', 'show', 'was', 'great', 'be', 're-issued', 'DVD', 'preferrably', '12', 'episode', 'FULL', 'SEASON', 'DVD']",Get a Life - Volume One 1990  VHS

501047,A231ZCJGWZA38A,B00000G3A6,"Claude Bouchard ""Eurodancemix""","[4, 29]","For some reason, I remember this show as being hilariously funny back in 1990.  Two things must have happened since then:  either I remember only  the good episodes--unlikely since there appears to be none, or I suffered  from a seriously juvenile sense of humor.  Unfortunately, I think the  latter is correct.  This DVD is a complete waste of $20.  How Chris Elliott  EVER got his own show is beyond comprehension, although I suspect a casting  couch and a pact with the devil were involved.As far as productions go,  the four episodes presented here are bottom-of-the-barrel amateurish fare:  &quot;Prettiest Week Of My Life&quot; has its short moments of brilliance  but too many unfunny minutes go by in the process, &quot;Bored  Straight&quot; suffers from unbelievably forced acting (looks more like a  rehearsal than an actual shoot), &quot;Spewey And Me&quot; is insultingly  stupid and mind-rotting (not to mention completely unfunny...there's not a  laugh to be found in this one), and while &quot;Girlfriend 2000&quot; is  the better episode of the lot it's not enough to justify or even sustain  the other three episodes.Technically, the DVD image is a bit grainy and  lacks crispness.  It looks as if they taped it directly from a television  during the original broadcast and copied the whole thing onto a DVD.  The  chapter access feature is standard.  The laugh tracks can be turned off on  three of the four episodes: it is this feature that reveals how really  awful this show is...without the laugh tracks, the juvenile scripts are  glaringly unfunny.  Finally, the previously-unseen &quot;bonus&quot;  footage has been unseen up until now for a very good reason: it's terrible!Avoid this DVD.

I was a big fan of the TV show and I was floored when I heard it was coming out on DVD.  The episodes are so funny!  I mean watching &quot;Spewey and  Me&quot;, I felt I was going to bust a gut.  &quot;Get A Life&quot;.  It's  moronic humor at its best. As for the DVD extras, with a TV show DVD, there  isn't much on it.  Well there are Never-Before-Seen Bonus footage and an  alternate audio version without a laugh track (but it's good to have that  one on), the 4 uncut episodes, I wonder if they mean that there are no  commercials. I don't know. If you loved the show, you will give it an A  which I did.  If you thought this show was quite daft, you wouldn't give it  an A and score this DVD low.  I score it a B-, A because I always liked the  show and a C- for not many extras but what can you expect.  Rhino did a  great job at releasing this DVD.

501051,A8RIVWC35B4RA,B00000G3A6,"G. Kukis ""Loserboy""","[7, 64]","The best part of my DVD is the FBI warning at the beginning and the theme song.  I am 4 episodes into to the first dvd and I have not laughed even once.  The humor is not clever.  It is Chris Elliot falling down and hurting himself over and over again, or exposing himself to radiation, and then someone cranks up the laugh track. I liked Chris okay on David Letterman; he wasn't the main attraction, but his skits there were okay, and I appreciated them.  Unfortunately, so far in this first season, this series sucks.  It isn't funny; it isn't clever.  The idea behind the series, a loser who still lives with his parents and has a paper route has promise.  The execution is pathetic.Let me give you an example of one of the most clever things on the show.  Chris falls in love with a gal in the 4th episode and he confides in Gus that everywhere he looks, he sees this girl's face.  Gus points out that he has pictures of her put up all over his room.  And the camera shows lots of pictures of this girl all over his wall.  Big laughs from the ""audience.""  Now, if that sounds funny to you and put a smile on your face, you will love this series.  Later on, this gal throws a rock from her window and hits Chris in the head.  Again, the laugh track is cranked up.  For me, I don't know if I will watch past this 4th episode.There are many good reviews here, which are an absolute mystery to me.  Maybe the key is, if ""Married With Children"" is your idea of high comedy, then ""Get a Life"" maybe right down your alley.Notice on several reviews, people recall how great this series was when they were 11 or 13; but when they see it again, they are suprised as to how bad it is now.  Maybe this would appeal to your 12 year old kid; and maybe if your intellect level is that of a 12 year old, this could be the show for you.

But if you like creative  humor from a comic genius, then you'll die watching these 4 episodes.  Chris Elliot has a unique comedy style which never caught on with many  viewers; but watch these 4 shows and you'll be starting a petition to bring  the show back. &quot;Spewey and Me&quot; will kill you. An alien crashes on  his front lawn, and Chris befriends him even though all the alien does is  beat and vomit on him.  If you saw his later movie, &quot;Cabin Boy,&quot;  you'll be a bit disappointed because he eased off the comedy he brought to  &quot;Get A Life.&quot; But these are episodes you can watch over and over  again, then cry after you see the junk they put on TV to replace this.  So  when you see a poor review for this show, perhaps it was given by a person  who thinks &quot;Spin City&quot; is funny. Or maybe somebody who cracks up  at the commercials for &quot;Veronica's Closet.&quot; Or maybe it's just  some demented, crazed junkie (I hear some drugs make funny things dumb and  dumb things funny).",5,BEST COMEDY SERIES EVER TO HIT TV,968198400,"09 6, 2000",2000,1140,"['like', 'witless', 'humor', 'such', 'what', ""'ll"", 'find', 'shows', 'quot', 'Spin', 'City', 'quot', 'then', ""'ll"", 'hate', 'show', 'like', 'creative', 'humor', 'comic', 'genius', 'then', ""'ll"", 'die', 'watching', '4', 'episodes', 'Chris', 'Elliot', 'unique', 'comedy', 'style', 'never', 'caught', 'many', 'viewers', 'watch', '4', 'shows', ""'ll"", 'be', 'starting', 'petition', 'bring', 'show', 'back', 'quot', 'Spewey', 'Me', 'quot', 'will', 'kill', 'alien', 'crashes', 'front', 'lawn', 'Chris', 'even', 'alien', 'beat', 'vomit', 'saw', 'later', 'movie', 'quot', 'Cabin', 'Boy', 'quot', ""'ll"", 'be', 'bit', 'disappointed', 'eased', 'off', 'comedy', 'brought', 'quot', 'Get', 'A', 'Life.', 'quot', 'are', 'can', 'watch', 'over', 'again', 'then', 'cry', 'see', 'junk', 'put', 'TV', 'replace', 'So', 'when', 'see', 'poor', 'review', 'show', 'perhaps', 'was', 'given', 'person', 'who', 'quot', 'Spin', 'City', 'quot', 'funny', 'maybe', 'somebody', 'who', 'up', 'commercials', 'quot', 'Veronica', 'Closet.', 'quot', 'maybe', 'just', 'demented', 'crazed', 'junkie', 'hear', 'drugs', 'make', 'funny', 'things', 'dumb', 'dumb', 'things', 'funny']",Get a Life - Volume One 1990  VHS

501064,ARFCORBCTKX1J,B00000G3A6,"William Sommerwerck ""grizzled geezer""","[1, 1]","When it first aired, &#65533;Get a Life&#65533; was a major break from what was considered an &#65533;acceptable&#65533; format for TV comedy. The principal character -- Chris Peterson, a 30-year-old newsboy who lives with his parents -- was weirdly asocial, perhaps even psychotic -- with no redeeming qualities. He looked &#65533;good&#65533; only in comparison with his antagonists, who were usually even more obnoxious than he.How do you write comedy when the protagonist is so cut-off from the conventions of normal thought and behavior that the other characters&#65533; reactions are little more than exasperated confusion? The answer is, &#65533;with great difficulty.&#65533; It&#65533;s like trying to assemble a wooden structure without nails. It&#65533;s hard to get laughs through character interaction when the main character doesn&#65533;t interact in any &#65533;normal&#65533; way with the other characters.About all you can do is mine Chris Elliot&#65533;s innate weirdness. So not only is &#65533;Get a Life&#65533; weird -- it's weird merely for the sake of being weird. The writers aren&#65533;t worried whether the stories make sense, either practically or psychologically, because Chris Peterson neither worries nor makes sense. What other sitcom has ever shown a dummy of the main character being repeatedly run over by cars?Clearly, &#65533;Get a Life&#65533; is a show about style, not content. In trying to be different from other sitcoms, the producers painted themselves into a corner that&#65533;s hard to maneuver in.The reaction of some reviewers -- that &#65533;Get a Life&#65533; isn&#65533;t as funny as they remembered &#65533; isn&#65533;t surprising. The shock and novelty of a pointless show about someone incapable of mundane social interactions has worn off.Nevertheless, &#65533;Get a Life&#65533; is generally funny, and has a few really good episodes. &#65533;Neptune 2000&#65533; remains my favorite, if only because it gives Bob Eliot the most on-screen time and the largest number of put-downs. It&#65533;s a model of how this sort of humor should be done, and is arguably a classic of TV comedy.For me, the show&#65533;s greatest pleasure is Bob Eliot&#65533;s deadpan-sarcastic putdowns. I grew up listening to Bob & Ray, two of the great comic geniuses of the last century, who virtually invented &#65533;pointless&#65533; humor.Amazon wants reviewers to focus on the content, but I can&#65533;t resist taking a pot shot at Rhino. Is there any other record company that delivers so little for the consumer&#65533;s hard-earned buck? There are only four episodes on each disk, where &#65533;Red Green&#65533; delivers eight. And &#65533;Get a Life&#65533; has a sufficiently large cult following that a multi-disk set with all the episodes would have made sense.",4,"""different"" -- not for every taste...",1054166400,"05 29, 2003",2003,2810,"['When', 'first', 'aired', '65533', 'Get', 'Life', '65533', 'was', 'major', 'break', 'what', 'was', 'considered', '65533', 'acceptable', '65533', 'format', 'TV', 'comedy', 'principal', 'character', 'Chris', 'Peterson', '30-year-old', 'newsboy', 'who', 'parents', 'was', 'weirdly', 'asocial', 'perhaps', 'even', 'psychotic', 'redeeming', 'qualities', 'looked', '65533', 'good', '65533', 'only', 'comparison', 'antagonists', 'who', 'were', 'usually', 'even', 'more', 'obnoxious', 'he.How', 'do', 'write', 'comedy', 'when', 'protagonist', 'so', 'cut-off', 'conventions', 'normal', 'thought', 'behavior', 'other', 'characters', '65533', 'reactions', 'are', 'little', 'more', 'exasperated', 'confusion', 'answer', '65533', 'great', 'difficulty.', '65533', '65533', 's', 'trying', 'assemble', 'wooden', 'structure', 'nails', '65533', 's', 'hard', 'get', 'laughs', 'character', 'interaction', 'when', 'main', 'character', 'doesn', '65533', 't', 'interact', '65533', 'normal', '65533', 'way', 'other', 'characters.About', 'can', 'do', 'mine', 'Chris', 'Elliot', '65533', 's', 'innate', 'weirdness', 'So', 'not', 'only', '65533', 'Get', 'Life', '65533', 'weird', 'weird', 'merely', 'sake', 'being', 'weird', 'writers', 'aren', '65533', 't', 'worried', 'stories', 'make', 'sense', 'practically', 'psychologically', 'Chris', 'Peterson', 'worries', 'sense', 'What', 'other', 'sitcom', 'ever', 'shown', 'dummy', 'main', 'character', 'being', 'repeatedly', 'run', 'over', 'cars', 'Clearly', '65533', 'Get', 'Life', '65533', 'show', 'style', 'not', 'content', 'trying', 'be', 'different', 'other', 'sitcoms', 'producers', 'painted', 'corner', '65533', 's', 'hard', 'maneuver', 'in.The', 'reaction', 'reviewers', '65533', 'Get', 'Life', '65533', 'isn', '65533', 'as', 'funny', 'remembered', '65533', 'isn', '65533', 't', 'surprising', 'shock', 'novelty', 'pointless', 'show', 'someone', 'incapable', 'mundane', 'social', 'interactions', 'worn', 'off.Nevertheless', '65533', 'Get', 'Life', '65533', 'generally', 'funny', 'few', 'really', 'good', 'episodes', '65533', 'Neptune', '2000', '65533', 'remains', 'favorite', 'only', 'Bob', 'Eliot', 'most', 'on-screen', 'time', 'largest', 'number', 'put-downs', '65533', 's', 'model', 'how', 'sort', 'humor', 'should', 'be', 'done', 'arguably', 'classic', 'TV', 'comedy.For', 'show', '65533', 's', 'greatest', 'pleasure', 'Bob', 'Eliot', '65533', 's', 'deadpan-sarcastic', 'putdowns', 'grew', 'up', 'listening', 'Bob', 'Ray', 'two', 'great', 'comic', 'geniuses', 'last', 'century', 'who', 'virtually', 'invented', '65533', 'pointless', '65533', 'humor.Amazon', 'reviewers', 'focus', 'content', 'can', '65533', 't', 'resist', 'taking', 'pot', 'shot', 'Rhino', 'there', 'other', 'record', 'company', 'so', 'little', 'consumer', '65533', 's', 'hard-earned', 'buck', 'are', 'only', 'four', 'episodes', 'disk', 'where', '65533', 'Red', 'Green', '65533', 'delivers', 'eight', '65533', 'Get', 'Life', '65533', 'sufficiently', 'large', 'cult', 'following', 'multi-disk', 'set', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'sense']",Get a Life - Volume One 1990  VHS
