1604104,A1C70R9KCILEU,B00A27OJ94,Elle,"[6, 6]","I enjoyedCase HistoriesSeries One.  Series Two brings us more of Edinburgh based private investigator, Jackson Brodie, and his indomitable spirit.  I think in a way, he can sometimes be too good for his own good.  He constantly puts the welfare of others before his own.  This, in my opinion, makes him a man of decent character with a sound moral compass.  (Just the way I like ""good guys"" to be.) The people who seek him out certainly benefit from his caring and compassionate nature even if his business does not.  As a private investigator, doing things out of the goodness of his heart doesn't pay the bills, as Deborah Arnold, his lovely and sassy ""secretary?"" so often reminds (nags) him.  Her threats of walking out unless he takes on clients with money influences him about as much as the power company turning off his lights.  Not so much.Brodie's penchant for taking on cases of those with troubles that he understands and relates to gets him in a lot of trouble.  He's also a sucker for the weak, helpless, abandoned, forgotten, and lost.  People turn to him when they have nowhere else to go.  And invariably, he helps them.  Successfully.He is not afraid to wade into the middle of things even if that means he'll wake up in a dumpster, beaten to a pulp. I told him, ""Run, Jackson, run!"" But not Jackson, he won't turn and run, it's just not in him. And somehow, once he heals, he ends up keeping his handsome looks.  Must be good genes.  I think though that he just cannot compromise his values to make a buck or even save his skin.  It's just not an option.  Even when he tries to walk away because he knows the case can only swing the wrong way, his better nature keeps him in the fight.  He's exactly the sort I'd be seeking if I needed help.His childhood is still a flashback thread in the plot.  The sadness of his youth has shaped him and his memories haunt him.Jackson Brodie is played masterfully by Jason Isaacs.  He's perfectly cast.  The first time I saw him was in Harry Potter Chamber of Secrets as Lucius Malfoy and he was fabulous.  He remains fabulous.There are three episodes.  All contain excellent stories involving twisty plots, intrigue, and interesting characters.  All actors are top-notch. Brodie becomes embroiled in some nasty cases and doesn't come out unscathed both physically and emotionally.  Due to being misled about a touchy child custody case he ends up owing the wrong person a favor and it's called in. He risks his license to help a former cop in a delicate situation to find a new identity.  His precocious daughter, Marlee, drops the bomb that her mum has given her permission to live with him. And she moves in.  In finding the biological parents of a young woman, he unearths some darkly disturbing skeletons in her gene pool.  Louise Munroe has some kind of pull on him even though he walks away from her and she marries another, yet, it is clear that she still carries a torch for him.  She reluctantly continues to help him in her capacity as a Detective Inspector when she can.  Julia Land, aspiring actress, his love interest of series one, returns as a kind of bee in his bonnet. And a beautiful ""new"" woman enters the story to steal his heart. (Methinks it is feast or famine when it comes to women in Jackson's life.) Oh, and lest I forget, The Ambassador, a mangy mutt becomes an unlikely sidekick.  When I saw the little fur ball, I was reminded of an expression my dear departed mom used to say, ""That dog is so ugly, he's cute.""  I don't know, it's just something she used to say. It just fits somehow.I think for those who liked the first, series two will not disappoint.  I hope I've written something that describes and perhaps tantalizes.  I aimed for ""vague"" so as not to spoil anyone's viewing pleasure.  Enjoy!",5,Run! Jackson! Run!

1604105,A3LQDYVAAHHV2T,B00A27OJ94,FYI,"[48, 49]","Jason Isaacs is superb as the Edinburgh, Scotland, based Jackson Brodie, a tormented former soldier and policeman who became a private detective. He never recovered after the murder of his sister Niamh, and the suicide of his older brother. As usual, Isaacs is pitch-perfect as Jackson Brodie, every nuance evoked with subtlety. Brodie is as haunted as a peat bog by past tragedies that ripple the surface of the present. Happily for fans, ""Case Histories: Series 2"" reunites Jackson Brodie with his precocious daughter Marlee (Millie Innes is a rare talent), perhaps his most honest and real relationship.The three features in ""Case Histories, Series 2"" are approximately 262 minutes in total; each feature is about 126 minutes long, with English subtitles (handy, if hearing the telly is difficult). The Extras run about 35 minutes.Started Early, Took My Dog:Based on a Kay Atkinson mystery novel, this first case opens with a vicious custody-case Jackson Brodie regrets being involved in; he winds up owing his employer, Mr. Minyawi, a favor. Returning to Edinburgh, he works to unravel a skein of mystery regarding a young woman's adoption, Hope Mamaster (beautifully played by Emma Hamilton). He is plagued by an old murder case that may connect with past colleagues, including Tracy, who has taken in an abused girl. Jackson recalls his hurt relationship with his mother, who abandoned him (it would have helped if the producers found a young actor that actually looks like a child-version of Jason Isaacs, as they did in Series 1, not one with curly red hair; we love ginger hair, that's not the issue). Policewoman Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington) tries to help Jackson, while harboring feelings for him. The filming of Edinburgh is a treat, from Jackson Brodie's offices on Victoria Street, to lovely panoramas. A pleasing moment is when Jackson punches a an abusive owner of an adorable Border Terrier, who then chooses to go home with his rescuer; Brody calls his scruffy new pal The Ambassador (real name: Crunchie the Dog). It's remarked that such is a big name for a little dog; Jackson replies, ""He's big on the inside."" Like the TARDIS. This episode also features the return of Zawe Ashton, that fierce Scottish redhead and force-of-nature James Cosmo, and guest stars Victoria Wood in a fine turn as Tracy.Nobody's Darling:Rachel Stewart hires Brodie to follow Andy, her fiance, whose former mother in-law (played by the marvelous Diana Quick) believes killed Isobel, her horse-riding daughter. Jackson's professional integrity is questioned yet again, when a past mistake curdles his life; no good deed go unpunished. Jackson is also working a case trying to solve the reason for missing funds for a bookie; turns out he wins big betting on horse Nobody's Darling, but the police believe Brodie is involved in a scam. At the racetrack, he meets (and later beds) Charlotte McGill (Dawn Steele, memorable inMonarch of the Glen. Marlee returns from New Zealand to try living with her dad, even inflictingVegemiteon him, but she soon learns Jackson is a pretty unreliable case. I must comment that the music overall in this series may leave viewers seriously underwhelmed, not the kind of stuff that in real-life a male private detective, even one with a deep heart, would listen to!Jackson and the Women:Jackson Brodie takes on a case for a Aiden Kelso, a young man whose mother, Isla Kelso was murdered years ago in what was called the Christmas Shopper Murder. Meanwhile, the favor to Mr. Minyawi is called in, when he asks Jackson to find his missing daughter Samira; Westernized, she has run away from home to escape her father's more traditional Muslim expectations. Fatherhood and its difficulties is a recurring theme in Series 2. Julia, Brodie's actress ex-girlfriend (from Series 1) looms large on the horizon; is the baby his? Charlotte is still on the scene, but for how long, and what are her motivations? And Louise Munroe gets divorced and is now available as well, but Jackson is a muddle.Extras:Behind the Scenes, and Jason Isaac's Video Diary Behind the Scenes: Stunts, Makeup, The Dog.If you enjoy ""Case Histories,"" I highly recommendVeraandVera: Set 2, featuring Brenda Blethyn. These mysteries are set in Northumbria's bleakly beautiful landscape.

It is a bit absurd, a little action, a touch of humor, and lots of drama surrounding the characters. Focus is on individual's lives more than the getting to the end of complicated cases. Often it becomes multiple cases that end up intertwined due to character relationships. A recurrence of a season opening situation takes place in each episode. Aside from Brodie, `Case Histories 2' is defined by female characters. Episodes are 90 min rather than stories in 2 hour-long parts.Jason Isaacs as Brodie, a push-over, ex-cop now PI, and domestically a train wreck. DC Munroe (Amanda Abbington -`Mr Salfridge) returns as romantic friction. Zawe Ashton as Deborah, gorgeous, capable, under appreciated, office-everything for Brodie.

1604110,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B00A27OJ94,Stephanie De Pue,"[3, 3]","CASE HISTORIES, Series 2, (2013).  This ITV-produced British mystery television series is set and filmed in Scotland.  The first series received its BBC TV debut in 2011, and was seen in the United States on PBS's Masterpiece Mystery. The second series aired in the U.K. on BBC in 2013, now makes its U.S. debut. Edinburgh-based private investigator Jackson Brodie, an emotionally-damaged former soldier and Edinburgh cop, finds himself tracking lost cats, wayward spouses, and killers on the run.  And he does a lot of running himself to escape the memories of his traumatic past.  The productions are based on the bestselling, award-winning novels by Kate Atkinson; the series was created for TV by Ashley Pharoah, (LIFE ON MARS). The box series consists of three episodes, totaling approximately 273 minutes or 4  hours, on 2 DVDs. It contains nudity, violence and coarse language and is intended for mature audiences only.  And, thank goodness and thank you RLJ Entertainment, it has subtitles, else viewers on my side of the Atlantic would be well and truly lost with the witty Scots dialog.Brodie (Jason Isaacs, HARRY POTTER, THE PATRIOT) is just trying to make a living. He has a hard time collecting his debts and paying his bills, but no shortage of clients, since he can't overlook a wrong or say no to a person in need. This character-driven series also stars Amanda Abbington, (AGATHA CHRISTIE'S POIROT, SHERLOCK), as DC Louise Munroe, seemingly the last Edinburgh cop still talking to her former colleague, and Zawe Ashton, (FRESH MEAT), as Deborah Arnold, Brody's longsuffering assistant. Millie Innes plays Brodie's daughter Marlee; Kirsty Mitchell, ex-wife Josie, Natasha Little, (KIDNAP AND RANSOM), his ex-lover actress Julia Land.  Some of his clients are parents looking for children; some children, looking for parents.  Some are concerned with the past; some, with the future. The women in Brodie's life don't seem to offer him much peace, either. Series star Isaacs, a Golden Globe and International Emmy nominee, ably plays Brodie as a moody, damaged but still tough guy with a soft heart.  He carries the series with empathy, a realization of the terrible cost of violence to its survivors as well as its victims, and biting Scottish humor.Disc 1Episode 1: Started Early, Took My DogThe investigator agrees to help a handsome young Australian woman.  She had been given up for adoption, has returned to Edinburgh to find her real parents. His investigation leads him to a 35-year-old secret; carrying it has troubled everyone involved. Brodie must decide whether to let the law take its course or do what he thinks best for a child.Episode 2: Nobody's DarlingA pretty young nanny hires Brodie to see if her employer/fianc&eacute; is cheating on her. During his inquiries he is also hired by the man's ex-mother-in-law, who suspects the fianc&eacute; of having murdered her daughter. A straightforward investigation turns into a cold case.  Marlee, Brodie's pubescent daughter, moves in with him; his home life gets difficult.Disc 2Episode 3: Jackson and the WomenThe women in Brodie's life give him a tough time.  He takes on two new cases. A teenage boy asks him to investigate the murder of his mother, killed on Christmas Eve when her boy was three. A family hires him to locate their missing 19-year-old daughter. What he discovers in both is painful for all parties, but particularly painful for Brodie. He makes  decisions that are costly for him but give the two young people a chance to move forward.The characterizations are deep and complex in these three stories, as are their plots, yet the suspense never lets up.  The Scottish settings are occasionally tourist-beautiful, Brodie seems to do most of his running around Arthur's Seat or on the beach; but they are usually in gritty, little-seen corners of the country's capital.  I found the series powerful, satisfying, surprising and gripping; involving in its emphasis on family relations, particularly those with/of daughters, as was the first series. And, as I recall, the Atkinson book on which the TV treatments are based, CASE HISTORIES.  (Oddly enough, I was given that book as a birthday present upon its publication, but remember that I didn't quite care for it, though I don't remember why.)  Nevertheless, I quite liked the first series of this production, which I reviewed on its web site, and in this house, we love this one.",5,"Moody, Damaged But Still Tough Guy with a Soft Heart",1404518400,"07 5, 2014",2014,4427,"['CASE', 'HISTORIES', 'Series', '2', '2013', 'ITV-produced', 'British', 'mystery', 'television', 'series', 'set', 'filmed', 'Scotland', 'first', 'series', 'received', 'BBC', 'TV', 'debut', '2011', 'was', 'seen', 'United', 'States', 'PBS', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'second', 'series', 'aired', 'U.K.', 'BBC', '2013', 'now', 'U.S.', 'debut', 'Edinburgh-based', 'private', 'investigator', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'emotionally-damaged', 'former', 'soldier', 'Edinburgh', 'cop', 'tracking', 'lost', 'cats', 'wayward', 'spouses', 'killers', 'run', 'lot', 'running', 'escape', 'memories', 'traumatic', 'past', 'productions', 'are', 'based', 'bestselling', 'award-winning', 'novels', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'series', 'was', 'created', 'TV', 'Ashley', 'Pharoah', 'LIFE', 'ON', 'MARS', 'box', 'series', 'three', 'episodes', 'totaling', 'approximately', '273', 'minutes', '4', 'hours', '2', 'DVDs', 'nudity', 'violence', 'coarse', 'language', 'intended', 'mature', 'audiences', 'only', 'thank', 'goodness', 'thank', 'RLJ', 'Entertainment', 'subtitles', 'else', 'viewers', 'side', 'Atlantic', 'would', 'be', 'well', 'truly', 'lost', 'witty', 'Scots', 'dialog.Brodie', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'HARRY', 'POTTER', 'THE', 'PATRIOT', 'just', 'trying', 'make', 'living', 'hard', 'time', 'collecting', 'debts', 'paying', 'bills', 'shortage', 'clients', 'ca', ""n't"", 'overlook', 'wrong', 'say', 'person', 'need', 'character-driven', 'series', 'also', 'Amanda', 'Abbington', 'AGATHA', 'CHRISTIE', 'POIROT', 'SHERLOCK', 'DC', 'Louise', 'Munroe', 'seemingly', 'last', 'Edinburgh', 'cop', 'still', 'talking', 'former', 'colleague', 'Zawe', 'Ashton', 'FRESH', 'MEAT', 'Deborah', 'Arnold', 'Brody', 'longsuffering', 'assistant', 'Millie', 'Innes', 'Brodie', 'daughter', 'Marlee', 'Kirsty', 'Mitchell', 'ex-wife', 'Josie', 'Natasha', 'Little', 'KIDNAP', 'AND', 'RANSOM', 'ex-lover', 'actress', 'Julia', 'Land', 'clients', 'are', 'parents', 'looking', 'children', 'children', 'looking', 'parents', 'are', 'concerned', 'past', 'future', 'women', 'Brodie', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'seem', 'offer', 'much', 'peace', 'either', 'Series', 'star', 'Isaacs', 'Golden', 'Globe', 'International', 'Emmy', 'nominee', 'ably', 'Brodie', 'moody', 'damaged', 'still', 'tough', 'guy', 'soft', 'heart', 'series', 'empathy', 'realization', 'terrible', 'cost', 'violence', 'survivors', 'as', 'well', 'victims', 'biting', 'Scottish', 'humor.Disc', '1Episode', '1', 'Started', 'Early', 'Took', 'My', 'DogThe', 'investigator', 'help', 'handsome', 'young', 'Australian', 'woman', 'had', 'been', 'given', 'up', 'adoption', 'returned', 'Edinburgh', 'find', 'real', 'parents', 'investigation', '35-year-old', 'secret', 'carrying', 'troubled', 'everyone', 'involved', 'Brodie', 'must', 'decide', 'let', 'law', 'take', 'course', 'do', 'what', 'best', 'child.Episode', '2', 'Nobody', 'DarlingA', 'pretty', 'young', 'nanny', 'hires', 'Brodie', 'see', 'employer/fianc', 'eacute', 'cheating', 'inquiries', 'also', 'hired', 'man', 'ex-mother-in-law', 'who', 'fianc', 'eacute', 'having', 'murdered', 'daughter', 'straightforward', 'investigation', 'cold', 'case', 'Marlee', 'Brodie', 'pubescent', 'daughter', 'moves', 'home', 'life', 'difficult.Disc', '2Episode', '3', 'Jackson', 'WomenThe', 'women', 'Brodie', 'life', 'give', 'tough', 'time', 'two', 'new', 'cases', 'teenage', 'boy', 'investigate', 'murder', 'mother', 'killed', 'Christmas', 'Eve', 'when', 'boy', 'was', 'three', 'family', 'locate', 'missing', '19-year-old', 'daughter', 'What', 'painful', 'parties', 'particularly', 'painful', 'Brodie', 'decisions', 'are', 'costly', 'give', 'two', 'young', 'people', 'chance', 'move', 'forward.The', 'characterizations', 'are', 'deep', 'complex', 'three', 'stories', 'are', 'plots', 'yet', 'suspense', 'never', 'up', 'Scottish', 'settings', 'are', 'occasionally', 'tourist-beautiful', 'Brodie', 'do', 'most', 'running', 'around', 'Arthur', 'Seat', 'beach', 'are', 'usually', 'gritty', 'little-seen', 'corners', 'country', 'capital', 'found', 'series', 'powerful', 'satisfying', 'surprising', 'gripping', 'involving', 'emphasis', 'family', 'relations', 'particularly', 'with/of', 'daughters', 'was', 'first', 'series', 'recall', 'Atkinson', 'book', 'TV', 'treatments', 'are', 'based', 'CASE', 'HISTORIES', 'Oddly', 'enough', 'was', 'given', 'book', 'birthday', 'present', 'publication', 'remember', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'care', 'do', ""n't"", 'remember', 'why', 'Nevertheless', 'quite', 'liked', 'first', 'series', 'production', 'reviewed', 'web', 'site', 'house', 'love', 'one']",Case Histories Set 2
1604111,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B00A27OJ94,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[0, 0]","When I received a review copy of the second season of this well-done crime/mystery series that was produced in 2011 by BBC Scotland (and affiliate of England&#8217;s BBC, but separate) I realized I had not seen the first season and it&#8217;s always best to start at the &#8220;beginning&#8221;, so I got this set of Season One. (Actually the package does not actually say &#8220;first season&#8221; as maybe the series hadn&#8217;t been renewed at that time. It has been though.).  After watching  (and reviewing &#8211; see my review)  the first set  I can tell you that you really need to start at the beginning. There are continuing relationships that form in this set that will be essential to understand later volumes.As I post this there are already 10 reviews. But I note that nearly all are from 2013 - over a year ago. &#8211; and I want to make you aware that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film or TV series together, whether it was in theaters, on TV, Streaming or on DVD or Bluray. So I always recommend that folks sort by &#8220;Newest First&#8221; and then look at both the date and the format that the customer is reviewing. This is of the physical two-disc DVD package which will be released in the US by RLJ (formerly Acorn) on July 15, 2014. There are major differences in the RLJ from previous ones and I want you to be aware of that.For the sake of briefness, I&#8217;ll assume you have come to this review after seeing Series 1 and so you know who Jackson Brodie is- as well as his daughter Marnee and other main characters. (If you don&#8217;t go back to Series 1, as I said above). With that said, I&#8217;ll point out that, unlike season 1 which consisted of 3 &#8220;stories&#8221; based on a series of books by Kate Atkinson,  the producers reformatted it into three episodes &#8211; each lasting approximately 90 minutes. This makes it flow smoother. Also, onlt the first episode is based on an Atkinson novel; the other two are newly scripted.I&#8217;ll let you read other reviews (but be aware of &#8220;spoilers&#8221;) for more on the content in Series 2 but will offer some suggestions for those in the US ordering this series:1) There is an English Subtitles&#8221; option on the DVD (added by Acorn Media). I recommend that you enable this feature). There are quite a few Scottish words which will confuse you.  And Acorn gives the viewer subtitles that are large, in bright yellow, and easy to read. Some of the best subtitles I&#8217;ve found.2) The series aired in the US on Masterpiece Mystery but in an EDITED version. Probably about 7 minutes or so. In addition to allowing for &#8220;funding messages&#8221; I&#8217;m sure it was for some pretty graphic violence as well as language (the S-word).3) There&#8217;s another &#8220;interesting&#8221; reason for using the subtitles. This time around the producers of the show decided to join the trend now to include nearly complete recordings by singer-songwriter to set the mood. For Jackson they use &#8220;Americana&#8221; recording artists like Lucionda Williams, The Cowboy Junkies and, a favorite of mine, Mary Gauthier). The artists are &#8211; surprisingly &#8211; not credited in the &#8220;end credits&#8221;, BUT they are identified &#8211; and the lyrics provided &#8211; as part of the subtitles!  (Way to go RLJ !)As in Series 1 each of the three stories has two crime stories running together .The DVD has TWO Bonus Features this time, though they overlap :A &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; featurette (18  minutes) with the cast as and the series Producer, which includes a lot of scenes from the showA set of five &#8220;Cast and Crew&#8221; interviews (27 minutes) with four of the cast as well as the Executive Producer. No clips here. It looks like some of these were used in the &#8220;Behind&#8221; featurette. Honestly, this time it was a bit of &#8220;overkill&#8221;, in my opinion.Brodie is still saying &#8220; I&#8217;ll see what I can do.&#8221; When approached by folks who are concerned for their lives.  But we also get to learn a lot more about his relationships with women (past and present and of various ages) this time around. If you liked Series1, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll enjoy Series 2.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of DVD of Series 2  BBC Scotland &#8220;crime&#8221; series &#8211; incl special features (and NO &#8220;spoilers&#8221;),1405123200,"07 12, 2014",2014,4355,"['When', 'received', 'review', 'copy', 'second', 'season', 'well-done', 'crime/mystery', 'series', 'was', 'produced', '2011', 'BBC', 'Scotland', 'affiliate', 'England', '8217', 'BBC', 'separate', 'realized', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'season', '8217', 'always', 'best', 'start', '8220', 'beginning', '8221', 'got', 'set', 'Season', 'One', 'Actually', 'package', 'not', 'actually', 'say', '8220', 'first', 'season', '8221', 'maybe', 'series', 'hadn', '8217', 'been', 'renewed', 'time', 'been', 'though.', 'watching', 'reviewing', '8211', 'see', 'review', 'first', 'set', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'need', 'start', 'beginning', 'are', 'continuing', 'relationships', 'form', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'essential', 'understand', 'later', 'volumes.As', 'post', 'are', 'already', '10', 'reviews', 'note', 'nearly', 'are', '2013', 'year', 'ago', '8211', 'want', 'make', 'aware', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'TV', 'series', 'together', 'was', 'theaters', 'TV', 'Streaming', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'So', 'always', 'recommend', 'folks', 'sort', '8220', 'Newest', 'First', '8221', 'then', 'look', 'date', 'format', 'customer', 'reviewing', 'physical', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'package', 'will', 'be', 'released', 'US', 'RLJ', 'formerly', 'Acorn', 'July', '15', '2014', 'are', 'major', 'differences', 'RLJ', 'previous', 'ones', 'want', 'be', 'aware', 'that.For', 'sake', 'briefness', '8217', 'assume', 'have', 'come', 'review', 'seeing', 'Series', '1', 'so', 'know', 'who', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'is-', 'as', 'well', 'daughter', 'Marnee', 'other', 'main', 'characters', 'don', '8217', 'go', 'back', 'Series', '1', 'said', 'said', '8217', 'point', 'out', 'season', '1', 'consisted', '3', '8220', 'stories', '8221', 'based', 'series', 'books', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'producers', 'reformatted', 'three', 'episodes', '8211', 'lasting', 'approximately', '90', 'minutes', 'flow', 'smoother', 'Also', 'first', 'episode', 'based', 'Atkinson', 'novel', 'other', 'two', 'are', 'newly', 'scripted.I', '8217', 'let', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'be', 'aware', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', 'more', 'content', 'Series', '2', 'will', 'offer', 'suggestions', 'US', 'ordering', 'series:1', 'English', 'Subtitles', '8221', 'option', 'DVD', 'added', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'recommend', 'enable', 'feature', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'Scottish', 'words', 'will', 'confuse', 'Acorn', 'viewer', 'subtitles', 'are', 'large', 'bright', 'yellow', 'easy', 'read', 'best', 'subtitles', '8217', 'found.2', 'series', 'aired', 'US', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'EDITED', 'version', 'Probably', '7', 'minutes', 'so', 'addition', 'allowing', '8220', 'funding', 'messages', '8221', '8217', 'sure', 'was', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'violence', 'as', 'well', 'language', 'S-word', '.3', '8217', 's', '8220', 'interesting', '8221', 'reason', 'using', 'subtitles', 'time', 'producers', 'show', 'decided', 'join', 'trend', 'now', 'include', 'nearly', 'complete', 'recordings', 'singer-songwriter', 'set', 'mood', 'Jackson', 'use', '8220', 'Americana', '8221', 'recording', 'artists', 'Lucionda', 'Williams', 'Cowboy', 'Junkies', 'favorite', 'mine', 'Mary', 'Gauthier', 'artists', 'are', '8211', 'surprisingly', '8211', 'not', 'credited', '8220', 'end', 'credits', '8221', 'are', 'identified', '8211', 'lyrics', 'provided', '8211', 'part', 'subtitles', 'Way', 'go', 'RLJ', 'Series', '1', 'three', 'stories', 'two', 'crime', 'stories', 'running', 'together', '.The', 'DVD', 'TWO', 'Bonus', 'time', 'overlap', '8220', 'scenes', '8221', 'featurette', '18', 'minutes', 'cast', 'series', 'Producer', 'lot', 'scenes', 'showA', 'set', 'five', '8220', 'Cast', 'Crew', '8221', 'interviews', '27', 'minutes', 'four', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'Executive', 'Producer', 'No', 'clips', 'here', 'were', 'used', '8220', 'Behind', '8221', 'featurette', 'Honestly', 'time', 'was', 'bit', '8220', '8221', 'opinion.Brodie', 'still', 'saying', '8220', '8217', 'see', 'what', 'can', 'do.', '8221', 'When', 'approached', 'folks', 'who', 'are', 'concerned', 'lives', 'also', 'get', 'learn', 'lot', 'more', 'relationships', 'women', 'past', 'present', 'various', 'ages', 'time', 'around', 'liked', 'Series1', '8217', 'sure', '8217', 'enjoy', 'Series', '2.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",Case Histories Set 2
