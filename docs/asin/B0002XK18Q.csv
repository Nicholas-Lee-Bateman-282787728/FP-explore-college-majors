849087,A1G69BQLIUMWPN,B0002XK18Q,cassidrm,"[11, 11]",I loved the first movie!  And the second one was even better (in my opinion)!  I owned the first movie in VHS and wanted it on DVD so I when the second one came out I got this double set.  And I am pleased with it!Spiderman fights with The Green Goblin in the first movie.  Spiderman has to also deal with moral issues and the Green Goblin is related to one of Spiderman's close friends.  Also you start the story of Peter and Mary Jane.  In one you also see that Peter's Uncle dies.  All of this gives a great plot and keeps your interest!  There is more in the movie but that is your main plot themes.  Spiderman is very heavy in morals and life lessons.  It is also great as a story!Spiderman 2 was even better than the first in my opinion.  Why?  I think that the characters had grown and the acting was better I also liked the fact that Mary Jane finds out Peter's secret!  Doc Ock was also a strong role.  It was great at portraying demons and the hardships of life and loss.  There is so much in Spiderman 2.  Peter has to tell his Aunt May a secret that will tear him and his Aunt apart.  He also struggles with being Spiderman and even toys with the thought of giving it up (let you watch to figure out if he does).  Mary Jane gets engaged and struggles with her friendship/love for Peter.  And James Franco discovers secrets in his own life and in Peter's life.  Makes for a great movie!I can't wait until the third movie!  I know this will be a series I will enjoy!,5,Spidey Rules!,1107734400,"02 7, 2005",2005,1476,"['loved', 'first', 'movie', 'second', 'one', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'opinion', 'owned', 'first', 'movie', 'VHS', 'wanted', 'DVD', 'so', 'when', 'second', 'one', 'came', 'got', 'double', 'set', 'am', 'pleased', 'Spiderman', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'first', 'movie', 'Spiderman', 'also', 'deal', 'moral', 'issues', 'Green', 'Goblin', 'related', 'one', 'Spiderman', 'close', 'friends', 'Also', 'start', 'story', 'Peter', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'one', 'also', 'see', 'Peter', 'Uncle', 'great', 'plot', 'keeps', 'interest', 'more', 'movie', 'main', 'plot', 'themes', 'Spiderman', 'very', 'heavy', 'morals', 'life', 'lessons', 'also', 'great', 'story', 'Spiderman', '2', 'was', 'even', 'better', 'first', 'opinion', 'Why', 'think', 'characters', 'had', 'grown', 'acting', 'was', 'better', 'also', 'liked', 'fact', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'out', 'Peter', 'secret', 'Doc', 'Ock', 'was', 'also', 'strong', 'role', 'was', 'great', 'portraying', 'demons', 'hardships', 'life', 'loss', 'so', 'much', 'Spiderman', '2', 'Peter', 'tell', 'Aunt', 'May', 'secret', 'will', 'tear', 'Aunt', 'apart', 'also', 'being', 'Spiderman', 'even', 'toys', 'thought', 'giving', 'up', 'let', 'watch', 'figure', 'out', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'engaged', 'friendship/love', 'Peter', 'James', 'Franco', 'secrets', 'own', 'life', 'Peter', 'life', 'Makes', 'great', 'movie', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'third', 'movie', 'know', 'will', 'be', 'series', 'will', 'enjoy']",Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2

Infact, most movies should be this good. It may even be better than spider-man? Since they did not have to focus so much on introducing the charicters, they where able to write and produce a very good movie. It continues Peter Parkers dual identity and the problems he has with it. It introduces the next bad guy in the series.

849089,A1CDNTB7377YH2,B0002XK18Q,Michael A. Newman,"[7, 8]","Sam Rami needs to be congratulated on making a film that totally outdoes its predecessor.  Tobey McGuire is great and is one of the most likeable characters (re: Peter Parker) that I have seen in a film in a long time.  Alfred Molina is great as one of the more charismatic villains that have ever been portrayed on the screen.  I found myself cheering several times throughout the movie.Peter Parker can't seem to hold a job (he's killing a pizza business that promises on-time delivery or it's free), his grades are stumbling (his extra-curricular activities as Spiderman keep him from being prepared for Dr. Connors class) and he keeps disappointing the woman he loves (he can't even show up to her Broadway performance).  He lives in a squalid one-room apartment and the landlord is constantly screaming at him for his rent while the landlord's daughter keeps staring longingly at him.  Everything comes to a head when Mary Jane announces that she is getting married to J. Jonah Jameson's son.Peter starts blaming Spiderman for all his woes and as a result his powers seem to slowly ebb from him.  He makes a decision to go against the promise he made to his dead Uncle Ben and decides to toss out his Spiderman suit and try to lead a normal life.He seems to be doing better in school and during a very hilarious sequence he struts around to the tune of Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head (reminiscent of a famous old movie).Meanwhile, Dr. Octavius has been turned into a supervillain (thanks to some computer controlled mechanical arms that have attached themselves to him and taken over his mind because of an accident during a scientific experiment).  Octavius, now Dr. Octopus, is on a crime wave to get the materials he needs to crate a nuclear reactor that could wipe out the city.A heart-to-heart talk with Aunt May and an attack by Dr. Octopus on the woman he loves, makes Peter realize that he must honor his motto (with great power, comes great responsibility) and become Spiderman once more.",5,Worth Owning!,1095379200,"09 17, 2004",2004,2005,"['Sam', 'Rami', 'be', 'congratulated', 'making', 'film', 'totally', 'predecessor', 'Tobey', 'McGuire', 'great', 'one', 'most', 'likeable', 'characters', 're', 'Peter', 'Parker', 'have', 'seen', 'film', 'long', 'time', 'Alfred', 'Molina', 'great', 'one', 'more', 'charismatic', 'villains', 'have', 'ever', 'been', 'portrayed', 'screen', 'found', 'cheering', 'several', 'times', 'movie.Peter', 'Parker', 'ca', ""n't"", 'seem', 'hold', 'job', 'killing', 'pizza', 'business', 'on-time', 'delivery', 'free', 'grades', 'are', 'stumbling', 'extra-curricular', 'activities', 'Spiderman', 'keep', 'being', 'prepared', 'Dr.', 'Connors', 'class', 'disappointing', 'woman', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'show', 'up', 'Broadway', 'performance', 'squalid', 'one-room', 'apartment', 'landlord', 'constantly', 'screaming', 'rent', 'landlord', 'daughter', 'staring', 'longingly', 'Everything', 'head', 'when', 'Mary', 'Jane', 'announces', 'getting', 'married', 'J.', 'Jonah', 'Jameson', 'son.Peter', 'blaming', 'Spiderman', 'woes', 'result', 'powers', 'seem', 'slowly', 'ebb', 'decision', 'go', 'promise', 'made', 'dead', 'Uncle', 'Ben', 'toss', 'out', 'Spiderman', 'suit', 'try', 'lead', 'normal', 'life.He', 'be', 'doing', 'better', 'school', 'very', 'hilarious', 'sequence', 'tune', 'Raindrops', 'Keep', 'Falling', 'My', 'Head', 'reminiscent', 'famous', 'old', 'movie', '.Meanwhile', 'Dr.', 'Octavius', 'been', 'turned', 'supervillain', 'thanks', 'computer', 'controlled', 'mechanical', 'arms', 'have', 'attached', 'taken', 'over', 'mind', 'accident', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'Octavius', 'now', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'crime', 'wave', 'get', 'materials', 'crate', 'nuclear', 'reactor', 'could', 'wipe', 'out', 'city.A', 'heart-to-heart', 'talk', 'Aunt', 'May', 'attack', 'Dr.', 'Octopus', 'woman', 'Peter', 'realize', 'must', 'honor', 'motto', 'great', 'power', 'great', 'responsibility', 'become', 'Spiderman', 'once', 'more']",Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2
