If they were trying to mix comedy, drama and mystery it fell short.  I think they were trying to get a Phillip Marlow feel and well, it just didn't quite hit the mark.  Considering there was nothing else to watch on the alphabet channels we chose this.I would recommend it to folks who have some time to kill.  Honestly, it put my husband to sleep.  I soldiered on to the very end, but was disappointed.  Make up your own mind.  It is included with Amazon Prime, so at least I didn't have any additional out of pocket expense to watch it.  Sorry, if you are a Jason Dohring fan you will probably like it.  It certainly wasn't JD's finest hour.",3,Not a favorite...,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",2014,751,"['Searching', 'Sonny', 'was', 'dull', 'lackluster', 'plot', 'was', 'actually', 'interesting', 'acting', 'ruined', 'were', 'trying', 'mix', 'comedy', 'drama', 'mystery', 'fell', 'short', 'think', 'were', 'trying', 'get', 'Phillip', 'Marlow', 'feel', 'well', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'hit', 'mark', 'Considering', 'was', 'nothing', 'else', 'watch', 'alphabet', 'chose', 'this.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'folks', 'who', 'have', 'time', 'kill', 'Honestly', 'put', 'husband', 'sleep', 'soldiered', 'very', 'end', 'was', 'disappointed', 'Make', 'up', 'own', 'mind', 'included', 'Amazon', 'Prime', 'so', 'least', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'additional', 'out', 'pocket', 'expense', 'watch', 'Sorry', 'are', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'fan', 'will', 'probably', 'certainly', 'was', ""n't"", 'JD', 'finest', 'hour']",Searching for Sonny

I liked him in Veronica Mars better, but this was kind of funny and turned out better.  He plays the opposite kind of character, which was fun to watch and his tag along gang.  It was much better towards the middle and end.",4,Funny,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,320,"['was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'first', 'only', 'watched', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'liked', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'better', 'was', 'kind', 'funny', 'turned', 'out', 'better', 'opposite', 'kind', 'character', 'was', 'fun', 'watch', 'tag', 'gang', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'middle', 'end']",Searching for Sonny

Streamed this because I enjoyed Jason Dohring in Veronica Mars in which he was really good as anguished, punk teen. There's no edge in his character in this movie and the rest of the cast is also totally forgettable. Don't waste your time watching this, just not worth it, even if the streaming is for free.",2,When is free not really free?,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2014,383,"['Sophomoric', 'cheesy', 'attempts', 'humor', 'fall', 'flat', 'most', 'time', 'Streamed', 'enjoyed', 'Jason', 'Dohring', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'anguished', 'punk', 'teen', 'edge', 'character', 'movie', 'rest', 'cast', 'also', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'Do', ""n't"", 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'just', 'not', 'worth', 'even', 'streaming', 'free']",Searching for Sonny

I did not have high hopes for it and thought it would be some trite romantic comedy, judging from the cover.  However, it was actually a weird, funny, and unique movie that made me laugh.  I like independent movies like this, where everything is outlandish and ridiculous without relying heavily on grotesque &#34;guy humor.&#34;  It's a clever, creative, and entertaining film.On a side note, the song which plays around 24 minutes into the movie is called &#34;Melt&#34; by Nicole Simone.  I had a hard time figuring out what the song was called and who sang it, so I wanted to include it in my review in case anybody was wondering.",5,Weird and Funny,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,777,"['Searching', 'Sonny', 'was', 'recommended', 'Prime', 'probably', 'had', 'bit', 'Veronica', 'Mars', 'addiction', 'could', ""n't"", 'stop', 'watching', 'did', 'not', 'have', 'high', 'hopes', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'trite', 'romantic', 'comedy', 'judging', 'cover', 'However', 'was', 'actually', 'weird', 'funny', 'unique', 'movie', 'made', 'like', 'independent', 'movies', 'where', 'everything', 'outlandish', 'ridiculous', 'relying', 'heavily', 'grotesque', '34', 'guy', 'humor.', '34', 'clever', 'creative', 'entertaining', 'film.On', 'side', 'note', 'song', '24', 'minutes', 'movie', 'called', '34', 'Melt', '34', 'Nicole', 'Simone', 'had', 'hard', 'time', 'figuring', 'out', 'what', 'song', 'was', 'called', 'who', 'sang', 'so', 'wanted', 'include', 'review', 'case', 'anybody', 'was', 'wondering']",Searching for Sonny
