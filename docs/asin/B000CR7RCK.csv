961343,A3VLX5Z090RQ0V,B000CR7RCK,"Del Keyes ""Elaborate Chattering Nut""","[9, 12]","Before typing this update, I finished watching the whole series by net.  Let me tell you, folks, I'm glad my feelings for this show remains the same; I liked it when I was finishing the 3rd episode, and I still like it when it's over.  ""Sleeper Cell"" deserved to earn a nomination for Best Miniseries, either on the Globes or Emmy's.- REVIEW [updated 12.19.05]""Sleeper Cell"" could've been aired on any regular station, but it couldn't.  Nevermind the violence, the language, and the lewd content, 'cause these things can be toned down.  No, the controversy that laid upon the show's dependancy to regular stations is the use of terrorists.  Of course that many shows in the action/drama center have dealt with terrorists before, mostly constraint in the antagonistic affair, but never have made the terrorists completely emphazied.  By the time anyone watches ""Sleeper Cell"", there's no doubt that viewers will become sympathetic over the ""enemies of the nation.""  And since this show is from Showtime, this show will contain sex and plenty of it; heck, one of the show's hideouts is a porn store.In this nine hour-long miniseries (ten if you count the 2-hour finale), ""Sleeper Cell"" covers the current fear of terrorism and the ignorance of the enemies we're surrounded by.  A black Muslim ex-con named Darwyn, played by ""Barbershop's"" Micheal Ealy, was freed from jail out of good behavior, after he was informed on a mission he had to take.  His mission was met by an extremist named Farik, played by ""The Mummy's"" Odeh Fehr, during a public Islamic sermon.  The extremist decides to test Darwyn through a series of private meetings, among his ""supporters.""  It only took one episode for Darwyn to earn the trust of the extremists.  What the group didn't realize Darwyn is that he is not an ex-con at all: he's really a FBI agent, playing an undercover role to follow all the plans the terrorists are making.  With little support from the bureau, it's all up to him, with a little help from his FBI partner (James LeGros), to expose them before doing what could be the most homicidal terrorist act yet.  It's tough to live a double life, especially when he's on both sides.This miniseries isn't all about the action, as it is all about planning.  Each episode, the terrorist cell initiating their big jihad in a step-by-step direction; sometimes their plan halts when a problem is not from their hands.  They'll go from Canada to Mexico in order for the bloody act to be accomplished, and there are innocent lives wasted for the cause.  It shows that even one mistake can jeopardize everything they worked hard for.  Even if there's not a lot of action in this series, I was still hooked on it because I was both scared and entertained by the whole scenario.I like the whole concept of the terrorists being the focus in this show, because I can how these ""enemies"" live their lives; they're committed to this insane act, but they're still people like you and I.  This concept wouldn't have worked if it wasn't for the involving characters, like a good drama should.  The three soldiers of the cell that isn't Darwyn all have secondary lives to live in.  One is a young caucasian who supports the Muslim cause, even though he's a purebred American, the other is a french womanizer who cares so much about his long-distant wife even after sleeping many women, and last one is a bosnian teacher who likes A Tribe Called Quest (now THAT's guy with good taste of hip-hop).  They all sacrified their social lives for the sake of a ""greater good"", but that doesn't mean they won't have some fun from time to time.  Even for a leader like Farik, who's as cold as extremists can be, has a life of his own.  These people may be the enemies committed for their ""honorable"" cause, but when they're not committed, they're just regular people.For Darwyn, even his objective voided him to live a normal life.  He engages in a intimate relationship to a typical hot widow and cares for her son, but his double persona stops him from having this development go further.  He wants to, but if tells her what he's doing, it would cost him not only the mission and his life, but the people he cared for.  However, her curiosities might lead her to find the truth by herself.Fortunately for this show, he and his love interest are not the only characters I cared for.  The deaths in the show are hard-to-swallow, and though it's not violently gratitous, it's shown in a manner that's sad to look at.  I love it when a show made me to feel sorry for the demise.  The only things I didn't love are are a few miscasting characters, and even though the character development is good, it could've been a little more natural.If ""Sleeper Cell"" doesn't get cable viewers to subscribe to Showtime, I don't know what will...besides ""Red Shoe Diaries.""  At least people are fortunate this series is getting a DVD release. It's a captivating drama with good direction, well-done acting, and it did a great job of showing how intense being a terrorist is.  This is a terrorist's story, but there's no doubt that the outcome would be bad on their side.  As predicted as how the story lays out, the ending still made me feeling morbid.This is Del Keyes, saying ""The enemy is here, we just don't know it.""(info) Resources say this DVD set might contain behind-the-scenes footage and audio commentaries by the show's creators.  Knowing Showtime DVDs, I'm sure this DVD will not have any subtitles, but Closed Captioning is a guaranteed.  AND, this DVD set only costs 35 dollars.  It's surprising cheap to get 9 hour-long episodes and a couple of good extras; you can't get something like that on a HBO season set.  If you haven't seen this show and loves crime drama with a twist, and doesn't mind the mature content, this is a good buy.",4,"Terrorizing lives, one episode at a time",1134172800,"12 10,

The main protagonist is an American undercover FBI agent in a US based sleeper cell. The main antagonist is a middle eastern executive that works at a US security firm thats trying to launch a major terrorist attack in Los Angeles, CA.It also dives into the darker side of the drug trade, sex slavery, and other vice issues that generate money for terrorist/criminal organizations. It also depicts the upper echelons of US Agencies that have little understanding of the problem/issues that are the seed of the conflict. This is counterbalanced by the work and frustrations that the main protagonist has to contend with while trying to complete his mission AND not getting killed doing it. The show gets kind of unnerving when they illustrate possible ways that terrorist groups get through customs, borders, and counterintelligence.

But this series left me affected forever about my idea of a ""terrorist"".  With an ongoing war in Iraq and after 9/11, most of us have had very poor feelings about any ""Middle Easterners"" we have seen on the streets of our country.After viewing Sleeper Cell, I was happy to see some different views projected on the Muslim religion.  Our family has Muslim friends and these people are anything but violent.  The undercover FBI agent in this series was himself a Muslim.  What opens your eyes to possiblity, is the fact that many of non Middle Eastern descent are portrayed as terrorists.  I found it entirely shocking, yet believable, that many born in the USA people with grudges both with our government and our society as a whole could be induced into a terrorist cult.I will never again view any Middle Easterner I see on the streets of my town as suspect.  I do embrace the fact that a terrorist can be anyone, from anywhere.  If the network meant to entertain me.  They did that.  If the Network intended this as something to make me think.  They have achieved this too!And on terrorists, while I am here.

While not apologizing for the terrorist's evil deeds, the series does explore the psychological motivations of the terrorists, each of which is brought to the jihad for different reasons. Among the clan are: A blonde-haired, fair-skinned white guy who fancies himself a Koran expert and seems to be drawn to the terrorist group out of a sense of rebellion against the army and his mother; a schoolteacher by day who became a jihadist based on his experiences living in Yugoslavia, where Muslims were persecuted; a thuggish Frenchman who seems enraptured with violence but who is unintellectual and not seeped in religious tradition. The main character, a black Muslim FBI agent, struggles to fit in with the group despite despising what he sees as the distortion of his faith. By exploring the psychology and human motivations of the terrorists, the series manages to go beyond the stereotypical evil-Middle-Eastern villain to paint a more complex portrait of the jihadists.

961363,A2MF2QVSCUI27G,B000CR7RCK,"Luan Gaines ""luansos""","[77, 83]","In the shell-shocked aftermath of 9/11, Americans sought information about a culture and religion ensconced in an ongoing political dialog of the Middle East that received only sporadic attention in the media. Suddenly, people were asking, why do they hate us? A few years have passed, the war on terrorism settled into a predictable good guys-bad guys debate that yields few answers to a troubling question. Along comes Sleeper Cell to inform the public, a fictitious fanatical terrorist group infiltrating Los Angeles with plans to claim more lives for the Al Qaeda cause. Through the offices of an FBI undercover agent, Darwyn (Michael Ealy), the government monitors his activity within the rapidly evolving plot, the day of destruction more imminent in each new episode. The king of the villains is Farik (Israeli-born Oded Fehr), charged with the overall success of the mission. The other group members are Christian (Alex Nesic), a Frenchman who has found Allah; a bitter Bosnian teacher, Ilija (Peter Lubatti); and blue-eyed all-American boy turned Muslim, Thomas Allen Emerson (Blake Shields): ""The history of Islam is written in two lines: One is the black of the scholars' ink, the other the red blood that the martyrs shed.""This series would be successful as non-stop action drama worthy of the accolades of the ""24"" aficionados, but the writers of Sleeper Cell add another level to this white-knuckle series, the subtleties of extremism contrasted with the true religion of Islam. Darwyn is a committed Muslim, sorely tested in his role as informant, ever on the lookout for an opportunity to spread the true word of Islam as millions practice it in America, without the taint of fundamentalism. Whenever one of his ""brothers"" blurts a fanatical slogan, Darwyn is ready to clarify in the true words of the Quran. Farik, on the other hand, is firmly entrenched in his hatred of everything American, harboring no mercy for innocents in his pursuit of revenge. Speaking of his mission to a superior, Farik declares, ""A man is not a Muslim until his tongue and his heart are submissive. If I fail again, you may take them both.""In one of the most affecting episodes, a soft-spoken sheik approaches a dedicated terrorist in a Yemen jail, armed only with his knowledge of the Quran. The questioning begins, ""Brother, what is the greatest jihad?"" When he hears the answer, ""War with the infidels"", this holy man explains the true nature of jihad, the battle within the self to become Allah's holy warrior. He teaches the extremist to go beyond the hatreds he has embraced, to discover the true meaning of his religion, to live his convictions. That such a terrorist can change is a tribute to the power of this religion. When the holy man travels to America to deliver a fatwa against any Al Qaeda operating in this country, Farik is charged with stopping him by any means; this fatwa would render a death blow to the entire endeavor. With his usual canniness, Farik chooses Christian to do the deed, the one man who had sought a private meeting after hearing the sheik speak at the mosque.In this riveting series, the terrorists move through the streets of LA with impunity, across the border to Mexico to tap financial resources from drug dealers and child purveyors, drive anthrax across the Canadian border into the States, and purchase explosives from White separatists with heroin. Meanwhile, the LAPD blunders into the middle of the FBI surveillance and Darwyn struggles to maintain his cover, until all converges in an explosive ending.

Sleeper Cell dealt with the very sensitive matter of terrorists and I think they handled it very well. Not only that but I walked away from this show knowing a lot more about Muslims than I did when I started watching it. It was also very interesting that Tommy who is white was a Muslim and it was very interesting to see how it played out over the course of the show.The show follows Darwyn who is an undercover FBI agent who tries to get recruited into the Sleeper Cell, a terrorist organization run by Farik. Darwyn is recruited to help Farik and fellow Muslims Khashul, Tommy, and Iilija as they plan to set of a bomb in LA. Through the ten hour show Darwyn must perform gain Farik's trust by ways that aren't legal and raise the eyebrows of the FBI. He also is in a relationship with Gayle who slowly starts to uncover what Darwyn is doing when he is not around her. The show is similar to Over There in being about a current conflict in the U.S. but it deals with the terrorists and a lot of it focuses on Islam. The authentic Arabic dialogue adds to the glory of this show and I think the acting was excellent.My only problem with Sleeper Cell is that it was only nine episodes.

961370,A3USFMTE78TRHY,B000CR7RCK,PD,"[2, 2]","Yes I said 24 for grown-ups! Look, I loved the 24 series as much as the next guy. Saying that, let's be real here and say 24 did have some unbelievably  absurd circumstances and twists at times. What Sleeper Cell does that 24 did not is bring realism to the table. Where 24 felt like you were watching an entertaining TV series (and it was), Sleeper Cell feels like you are watching real life events unfold. The writing is superb, but most of the credit for this can go to the acting and character development. The main character is truly phenomenal in portraying the stresses of undercover work and in his commitment to fighting for his religion's true meaning. Having this character be a true Muslim is key in making this show work, as you can see his drive to go through what he goes through. The show is careful to not make its existence a Saturday morning in between cartoons message that not all Muslims are bad. Most rational people already know this and the show is careful not to insult our intelligence.The show doesn't do everything right, it at times humanizes the terrorists a little too much and seems to create excuses for their existence. Believe it or not, not every terrorist has a rational motive for becoming what they are. Not every terrorist was wronged, in poverty, or raised to be that way.There are few inconsistencies with the show, but they are so unnecessary that you have to wonder why they were in the script. The French guy's wife saying he used to be a good man....when? He was a Nazi turned terrorist! Why did this super secret cell with a leader who never made mistakes let this stupid anger management impaired blonde kid in the cell? He was a disaster waiting to happen. What was up with the Bosnian karaoke rap? Why did the truck driver think he was going to be killed after hearing the Islamic date of the attack, when the UC FBI agent didn't even understand the date and got it wrong!? Just a few silly things that could have been left out, with the awesome writing I am surprised they made their way in. In all honesty I am being very nitpicky here, the show was that good.While the show seems to go out of its way to be politically correct in making each terrorist from a different origin, it is actually closer to reality than many may think. Only about 30% of Muslims are actually Arab, and more and more ""homegrown"" terrorists are surfacing which makes profiling extremely difficult.In conclusion, people here saying this show is left wing, liberal, PC, etc....are saying so with ignorance. This is coming from someone who voted Bush/Cheney twice and miss them now. I am also speaking from a position of experience and education here when I say while the show is dramatized to entertain it is also, for the most part, accurate in many ways. Yes it touches on subjects like the general ignorance of Americans when it comes to Islam, which ironically is what those same ignorant people are criticizing.",5,24 for grown-ups,1315612800,"09 10, 2011",2011,2944,"['Yes', 'said', '24', 'grown-ups', 'Look', 'loved', '24', 'series', 'as', 'much', 'next', 'guy', 'Saying', 'let', 'be', 'real', 'here', 'say', '24', 'did', 'have', 'unbelievably', 'absurd', 'circumstances', 'twists', 'times', 'What', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', '24', 'did', 'not', 'bring', 'realism', 'table', 'Where', '24', 'felt', 'were', 'watching', 'entertaining', 'TV', 'series', 'was', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'feels', 'are', 'watching', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'unfold', 'writing', 'superb', 'most', 'credit', 'can', 'go', 'acting', 'character', 'development', 'main', 'character', 'truly', 'phenomenal', 'portraying', 'stresses', 'undercover', 'work', 'commitment', 'fighting', 'religion', 'true', 'meaning', 'Having', 'character', 'be', 'true', 'Muslim', 'key', 'making', 'show', 'work', 'can', 'see', 'drive', 'go', 'what', 'show', 'careful', 'not', 'make', 'existence', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoons', 'message', 'not', 'Muslims', 'are', 'bad', 'Most', 'rational', 'people', 'already', 'know', 'show', 'careful', 'not', 'insult', 'intelligence.The', 'show', ""n't"", 'do', 'everything', 'right', 'times', 'humanizes', 'terrorists', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'create', 'excuses', 'existence', 'Believe', 'not', 'not', 'terrorist', 'rational', 'motive', 'becoming', 'what', 'are', 'Not', 'terrorist', 'was', 'wronged', 'poverty', 'raised', 'be', 'are', 'few', 'inconsistencies', 'show', 'are', 'so', 'unnecessary', 'have', 'wonder', 'why', 'were', 'script', 'French', 'guy', 'wife', 'saying', 'used', 'be', 'good', 'man', '.when', 'was', 'Nazi', 'turned', 'terrorist', 'Why', 'did', 'super', 'cell', 'leader', 'who', 'never', 'made', 'mistakes', 'let', 'stupid', 'anger', 'management', 'impaired', 'blonde', 'kid', 'cell', 'was', 'disaster', 'waiting', 'happen', 'What', 'was', 'up', 'Bosnian', 'karaoke', 'rap', 'Why', 'did', 'truck', 'driver', 'think', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'killed', 'hearing', 'Islamic', 'date', 'attack', 'when', 'UC', 'FBI', 'agent', 'did', ""n't"", 'even', 'understand', 'date', 'got', 'wrong', 'Just', 'few', 'silly', 'things', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'out', 'awesome', 'writing', 'am', 'surprised', 'made', 'way', 'honesty', 'am', 'being', 'very', 'nitpicky', 'here', 'show', 'was', 'show', 'go', 'out', 'way', 'be', 'politically', 'correct', 'making', 'terrorist', 'different', 'origin', 'actually', 'closer', 'reality', 'many', 'may', 'think', 'Only', 'about', '30', '%', 'Muslims', 'are', 'actually', 'Arab', 'more', 'more', 'homegrown', 'terrorists', 'are', 'surfacing', 'profiling', 'extremely', 'difficult.In', 'conclusion', 'people', 'here', 'saying', 'show', 'left', 'wing', 'liberal', 'PC', 'etc', '.are', 'saying', 'so', 'ignorance', 'coming', 'someone', 'who', 'voted', 'Bush/Cheney', 'twice', 'miss', 'now', 'am', 'also', 'speaking', 'position', 'experience', 'education', 'here', 'when', 'say', 'show', 'dramatized', 'entertain', 'also', 'most', 'part', 'accurate', 'many', 'ways', 'Yes', 'subjects', 'general', 'ignorance', 'Americans', 'when', 'Islam', 'ironically', 'what', 'same', 'ignorant', 'people', 'are', 'criticizing']",Sleeper Cell:  Season 1

Vaughn ""I'm boycotting Amazon's...","[2, 2]","I'd never heard of this show and didn't have Showtime, but I have to thank Angela Yee for getting me to watch it. She asked Michael Ealy on ""The Breakfast Club"" about whether he's ever had to wear a sock for his lower region during a sex scene and he said in this show he did. So that's why I got a copy of Season One. Yes, I realize that's an incredibly superficial reason to do it, but hey, Michael Ealy is gorgeous, I wanted to know why he had to wear it, so there you have it.Now as goofy as my reason for getting the first season of this show was, I was so impressed with the actual show. I had no idea what I was about to watch. I just knew Michael Ealy was in it. The show has a realistic and intelligent plot. The background of the characters were believable. The action and strategy in this film was well-researched. The script was fast paced but viewers could keep up, and I enjoyed observing each character's reactions. In this film, Michael Ealy (Darwyn Al-Sayeed) plays a Muslim undercover cop who is trying to find out what plans a group of terrorists will do in America.The crew is made up of a handsome and serial-cheating Frenchman (Alex Nesic), a Bosnian chemist (Henri Lubatti), and a younger guy who had a strange childhood and a beef against the military (Blake Shields). The four of them are lead by Farik (Oded Fehr), who has completely opposing views of the Quran and Muslim principles from Darwn, who actually is Muslim. In the middle of Darwyn trying to convince his Jihadist terrorist ""brothers"" that he's loyal to them, he ends up in a relationship with a single and meddling mother (Melissa Sagemiller). I think his relationship with her (the reason I even wanted to see the film) was the only part that seemed awkward to me. I never saw much chemistry between the two no matter how hard they tried and it reminded me of Eve and Michael Ealy in ""Barbershop 2: Back in Business (Special Edition)."" They tried, but I couldn't stay interested in her character; I think it was more the actress than it was the dialogue but I'd need to see her in another film to confirm that.However, I loved every minute of the show and after renting copies, I bought the set. I thought it was REALLY important to show the similarities and differences between two people of the same religion who have differing views on how they should live, and the kid who was smuggled in to help them was the most powerful episode on the entire first season.

My only complaint with the show is the seemingly unwritten policy of political correctness with regard the the Muslim community.The shows producers seem to be of the ""Radical Muslims have nothing to do with real Islam or the Koran"" persuasion.

The series deals on The terrorists in America and is a good series , But i am afraid it has not had enough publicity too make it talked about or making people wanted too see it , unlike SHO's newer series ""Weeds"" (which of corse didnt live up to the great expectations many had viewed) So all in all ""Sleeper Cell"" is a great special TV Series Event and would be better if more people could see it!",4,Showtime accually has a Success Story,1134259200,"12 11, 2005",2005,654,"['Showtime', 'well', 'know', 'cutting', 'edge', 'groundbreaking', 'series', 'such', 'Queer', 'Folk', 'L', 'Word', 'now', 'having', 'show', 'called', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'accually', 'good', 'not', 'well', 'known', 'not', 'many', 'people', 'have', 'SHOWTIME', 'shame', 'one', 'can', 'see', 'series', 'deals', 'terrorists', 'America', 'good', 'series', 'i', 'am', 'afraid', 'not', 'had', 'enough', 'publicity', 'too', 'make', 'talked', 'making', 'people', 'wanted', 'too', 'see', 'SHO', 'newer', 'series', 'Weeds', 'corse', 'didnt', 'live', 'up', 'great', 'expectations', 'many', 'had', 'viewed', 'So', 'all', 'Sleeper', 'Cell', 'great', 'special', 'TV', 'Series', 'Event', 'would', 'be', 'better', 'more', 'people', 'could', 'see']",Sleeper Cell:  Season 1
