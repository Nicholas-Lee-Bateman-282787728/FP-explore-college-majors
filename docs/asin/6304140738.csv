It's as if American society wants to let it die, which is a real shame because Halloween is my favourite holiday. I absolutely love this movie. It was made in 1993 but it has a feel to it that makes it seem far older. It just has an old fashioned quality to it that I find strangely comforting.It's based on the story by Ray Bradbury, author of The Martian Chronicles and Fahrenhiet 451 and he even narrates it, which I love. Bradbury is one of my favourite authors. Sure this film has a few slightly dark moments but it's actually very educational and at the same time heart warming.",5,Charming,1188086400,"08 26, 2007",2007,682,"['was', 'lovely', 'animated', 'holiday', 'special', 'do', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'many', 'Halloween', 'specials', 'anymore', 'American', 'society', 'let', 'die', 'real', 'shame', 'Halloween', 'favourite', 'holiday', 'absolutely', 'love', 'movie', 'was', 'made', '1993', 'feel', 'seem', 'far', 'older', 'just', 'old', 'fashioned', 'quality', 'find', 'strangely', 'comforting.It', 'based', 'story', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'author', 'Martian', 'Chronicles', 'Fahrenhiet', '451', 'even', 'love', 'Bradbury', 'one', 'favourite', 'authors', 'Sure', 'film', 'few', 'slightly', 'dark', 'moments', 'actually', 'very', 'educational', 'same', 'time', 'heart', 'warming']",N/A

The film is based on a story by Ray Bradbury, and he narrates the movie. The movie is very different than the book, but than what movie isn't? The scary ""Moundshroud"" character keeps you guessing as to whether his intents are good or evil. He is wonderfully voiced by Leonard Nimoy, and if you have never heard him voice animated films, not only is he really good but you can't tell it is him!In the story 4 kids,(3 boys and 1 girl) are preparing for Halloween night and find that their buddy Pippin is being taken away in an ambulance. No one seems to know whats wrong with him, and the kids seem lost without him as he is the one they all look up to. A mysterious character shows up by the name of Moundshroud, who tells them that his spirit has been taken by ghosts of Halloween past and they must come with him to capture Pippins spirit and return it to its body. But can they trust him, as it seems he has his own secret motive for capturing Pippin. Each of the kids is dressed as a classic Haloween character Moundshroud takes them across the world and through time itself to discover the origin of that classic Halloween costume character. For example the hunt for the mummys origin  leads them to ancient Egypt and its dark secrets. The skeleton takes them to old Mexico for ""Day of the Dead"" celebrations. The Witch takes them back to the bards of England. They also learn what real friendship truly means, and must freely give a huge personal sacrifice if they want to save the soul of their friend.This movie is bigger in story than it seems, and my wife has watched this tape about 6 times. The animation is good, very fluid, good character design. The movie will keep you guessing until the end. Suspenseful, imaginative, and educational without looking like it is trying to be.UPDATE: Thanks to E. Von Ray for alerting me, this has finally been released in DVD in September 2010 after it's original VHS release in 1996. The new DVD is only a DVR print on demand copy by Warner Archives, so we will see how the quality is. Some DVD players do not like the DVR format. If I buy one I will update here, and hang on to my VHS copy for now.",4,"Very entertaining, spooky treat",1045872000,"02 22, 2003",2003,2296,"['First', 'let', 'warn', 'little', 'too', 'spooky', 'kids', '7', 'won', 'Emmy', 'Award', 'award', 'Film', 'Advisory', 'Board', 'film', 'based', 'story', 'Ray', 'Bradbury', 'movie', 'movie', 'very', 'different', 'book', 'what', 'movie', ""n't"", 'scary', 'Moundshroud', 'character', 'guessing', 'intents', 'are', 'good', 'evil', 'wonderfully', 'voiced', 'Leonard', 'Nimoy', 'have', 'never', 'heard', 'voice', 'animated', 'films', 'not', 'only', 'really', 'good', 'ca', ""n't"", 'tell', 'story', '4', 'kids', '3', 'boys', '1', 'girl', 'are', 'preparing', 'Halloween', 'night', 'find', 'buddy', 'Pippin', 'being', 'taken', 'away', 'ambulance', 'one', 'know', 'whats', 'wrong', 'kids', 'seem', 'lost', 'one', 'look', 'up', 'mysterious', 'character', 'up', 'name', 'Moundshroud', 'who', 'spirit', 'been', 'taken', 'ghosts', 'Halloween', 'past', 'must', 'come', 'capture', 'Pippins', 'spirit', 'return', 'body', 'can', 'trust', 'own', 'secret', 'motive', 'capturing', 'Pippin', 'kids', 'dressed', 'classic', 'Haloween', 'character', 'Moundshroud', 'world', 'time', 'discover', 'origin', 'classic', 'Halloween', 'costume', 'character', 'example', 'hunt', 'mummys', 'origin', 'ancient', 'Egypt', 'dark', 'secrets', 'skeleton', 'old', 'Mexico', 'Day', 'Dead', 'celebrations', 'Witch', 'back', 'bards', 'England', 'also', 'learn', 'what', 'real', 'friendship', 'truly', 'must', 'freely', 'give', 'huge', 'personal', 'sacrifice', 'want', 'save', 'soul', 'friend.This', 'movie', 'bigger', 'story', 'wife', 'watched', 'tape', '6', 'times', 'animation', 'good', 'very', 'fluid', 'good', 'character', 'design', 'movie', 'will', 'keep', 'guessing', 'end', 'Suspenseful', 'imaginative', 'educational', 'looking', 'trying', 'be.UPDATE', 'Thanks', 'E.', 'Von', 'Ray', 'alerting', 'finally', 'been', 'released', 'DVD', 'September', '2010', 'original', 'VHS', 'release', '1996', 'new', 'DVD', 'only', 'DVR', 'print', 'demand', 'copy', 'Warner', 'Archives', 'will', 'see', 'how', 'quality', 'DVD', 'players', 'do', 'not', 'DVR', 'format', 'buy', 'one', 'will', 'update', 'here', 'hang', 'VHS', 'copy', 'now']",N/A
