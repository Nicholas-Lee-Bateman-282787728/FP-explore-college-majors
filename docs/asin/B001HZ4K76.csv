I decided at the beginning of this year to do something about it and since January I have lost 40 pounds. I started eating on smaller plates & making healthier choices here and there & I started working out every day. At first, I could not do much but over time I started working out an hour to an hour and a half a day. I tell you this so you can get an idea of where I am as far as physically fit goes,so I figured you can make your own judgement about whether or not my idea of challenging would be your idea of challenging. I loved this! Violet is encouraging without being annoying. This workout is difficult, but not impossible. I work up quite a sweat & when I first started doing it I was extremely sore the next day. She has a few workout options, you can choose from 2 different 20 minute workouts or do the entire workout at once. I love the short bursts of sculpting, followed by short bursts of cardio.

1202690,A17V9XL4CWTQ6G,B001HZ4K76,Chandler,"[37, 39]","My workout regimen is an extensive collection of fitness dvds. If I feel my motivation waning, I'll buy one or two new ones so I wound up with quite a rotation of a library of workout dvds. Because of this, I'm picky about which ones I like, which ones I keep, and I have quite a comparison.INSTRUCTION:Excellent.The instructor has a soothing British accent and is very calm yet she pushes you with her WORDS rather than with yelling at you. Her energy is excellent, as is that of those who follow her in the dvd.CUEING:Great cueing. I did get tripped up once but I can assure you, for me, that's great cueing. I have two left feet and found her very easy to follow.CALORIC BURN:Weight Loss Cardio Sculpt takes to heart the evidence that the most effective workout will get your heart rate up but still allow it to roller coaster down some, then do strength training and alternate this fat burning and muscle building circuit through the workout. I wear a bodybugg to measure my daily caloric burn so I can actually SEE scientifically how many calories a workout I do burns and how many calories I burn per minute doing it...and this was a scorcher!! However, the moves really worked my muscles well too which means, with strength training, you continue to burn calories long after the workout is done in addition to the cardio he has which burns them fast during the workout. But whether you measure your own caloric burn or not, you'll feel your heart rate stay in the prime fat burning zone. It gets it up there!WHY CIRCUIT TRAINING DOESN'T BURN YOU OUT BUT BURNS THE CALORIES:Many people still hold to the myth that in order to burn the most fat you have to work out as hard as you can. The most extensive studies in the last few years that are now accepted as medical fact  show that, just as a car that goes really fast then slows down then goes really fast and slows down uses more fuel than a car that goes 90mph the whole time, so does your body use more fuel (fat) doing the same roller coaster of speed. You don't have to feel like you are going to pass out in a workout to actually be burning more fat. This is why circuit training is now the ""go to"" workout when in the 70s and 80s it was all aerobics.  An all cardio workout burns more calories during the workout but, although strength training wont make you break the same sweat or burn as much during the workout, it actually continues burning calories long after the workout is over and builds muscle which means you burn more calories even when your body is at rest. I measure all of the above...my caloric boost for the day, during the workout, and how many the workout burns per minute to get the full picture.SET: Love the set. Looks like they cleared out a cool urban New York loft. Throw some furniture in that place and I'd be happy staying there long after the workout is done...(it may look like a brick warehouse with cool windows to anyone else, but I'm all about urban loft architecture so maybe I just see it as such)So...it's different and different is good when you have rotate fitness dvdsMUSIC: Upbeat electronica...gets you revved.NEGATIVES:I found the warm up to be too long. My heart rate got up well once the workout began but the low intensity warm up took too much time from the workout that could be burning fat since it's longer than most warm ups. Not a big deal to me. I now warm up a couple minutes on my own then play the workout or hit fast forward after I've done it a couple minutes so I don't spend more time than is needed in this state rather than the actual workout, especially if I'm pressed for time.  Also if you aren't good at balance at this point in your fitness routine, you may feel tripped up at the beginning of the second routine. She doesn't mention this, but simply resting your other foot on the floor rather than raising it (until you build up your balance abilities, which you will) will work just fine.CONCLUSION: This workout is a favorite and gets the results. It burns off the fat, builds the muscle and the instruction is excellent. Great caloric burn and good circuit workout mix. You'll feel it and it'll work.ALTERNATIVES:If you like the high calorie burn coupled with strength training and great instruction in this dvd you may also like:1.Body by Jake Total Body Workout2.The Biggest Loser dvds and Jillian's dvds3.Kathy Smith Build Muscle Shrink Fat4.Crunch Total Resculpt5.Star Trainers: Strength",5,"Measured high for caloric burn, but also offered muscle toning and great instruction",1256515200,"10 26, 2009",2009,4428,"['workout', 'regimen', 'extensive', 'collection', 'fitness', 'dvds', 'feel', 'motivation', 'waning', ""'ll"", 'buy', 'one', 'two', 'new', 'ones', 'so', 'wound', 'up', 'quite', 'rotation', 'library', 'workout', 'dvds', ""'m"", 'picky', 'ones', 'like', 'ones', 'keep', 'have', 'quite', 'comparison.INSTRUCTION', 'Excellent.The', 'instructor', 'soothing', 'British', 'accent', 'very', 'calm', 'yet', 'WORDS', 'rather', 'yelling', 'energy', 'excellent', 'who', 'follow', 'dvd.CUEING', 'Great', 'cueing', 'did', 'get', 'tripped', 'up', 'once', 'can', 'assure', 'great', 'cueing', 'have', 'two', 'left', 'feet', 'found', 'very', 'easy', 'follow.CALORIC', 'BURN', 'Weight', 'Loss', 'Cardio', 'Sculpt', 'heart', 'evidence', 'most', 'effective', 'workout', 'will', 'get', 'heart', 'rate', 'up', 'still', 'allow', 'roller', 'coaster', 'then', 'do', 'strength', 'training', 'alternate', 'fat', 'burning', 'muscle', 'building', 'circuit', 'workout', 'wear', 'bodybugg', 'measure', 'daily', 'caloric', 'burn', 'can', 'actually', 'SEE', 'scientifically', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'workout', 'do', 'burns', 'how', 'many', 'calories', 'burn', 'minute', 'doing', 'was', 'scorcher', 'However', 'moves', 'really', 'worked', 'muscles', 'well', 'too', 'strength', 'training', 'continue', 'burn', 'calories', 'long', 'workout', 'done', 'addition', 'cardio', 'fast', 'workout', 'measure', 'own', 'caloric', 'burn', 'not', ""'ll"", 'feel', 'heart', 'rate', 'stay', 'prime', 'fat', 'burning', 'zone', 'up', 'there', 'WHY', 'CIRCUIT', 'TRAINING', 'DOES', ""N'T"", 'BURN', 'YOU', 'OUT', 'BUT', 'BURNS', 'THE', 'CALORIES', 'Many', 'people', 'still', 'hold', 'myth', 'order', 'burn', 'most', 'fat', 'have', 'work', 'out', 'as', 'hard', 'can', 'most', 'extensive', 'studies', 'last', 'few', 'years', 'are', 'now', 'accepted', 'medical', 'fact', 'show', 'just', 'car', 'really', 'fast', 'then', 'down', 'then', 'really', 'fast', 'down', 'uses', 'more', 'fuel', 'car', '90mph', 'whole', 'time', 'so', 'body', 'use', 'more', 'fuel', 'fat', 'doing', 'same', 'roller', 'coaster', 'speed', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'feel', 'are', 'going', 'pass', 'out', 'workout', 'actually', 'be', 'burning', 'more', 'fat', 'why', 'circuit', 'training', 'now', 'go', 'workout', 'when', '70s', '80s', 'was', 'aerobics', 'cardio', 'workout', 'more', 'calories', 'workout', 'strength', 'training', 'wont', 'make', 'break', 'same', 'sweat', 'burn', 'much', 'workout', 'actually', 'burning', 'calories', 'long', 'workout', 'builds', 'muscle', 'burn', 'more', 'calories', 'even', 'when', 'body', 'rest', 'measure', 'above', 'caloric', 'boost', 'day', 'workout', 'how', 'many', 'workout', 'burns', 'minute', 'get', 'full', 'picture.SET', 'Love', 'set', 'cleared', 'out', 'cool', 'urban', 'New', 'York', 'loft', 'Throw', 'furniture', 'place', ""'d"", 'be', 'happy', 'staying', 'there', 'long', 'workout', 'done', 'may', 'look', 'brick', 'warehouse', 'cool', 'windows', 'anyone', 'else', ""'m"", 'urban', 'loft', 'architecture', 'maybe', 'just', 'see', 'such', 'So', 'different', 'different', 'good', 'when', 'have', 'rotate', 'fitness', 'dvdsMUSIC', 'Upbeat', 'electronica', 'revved.NEGATIVES', 'found', 'warm', 'up', 'be', 'too', 'long', 'heart', 'rate', 'got', 'up', 'well', 'workout', 'began', 'low', 'intensity', 'warm', 'up', 'took', 'too', 'much', 'time', 'workout', 'could', 'be', 'burning', 'fat', 'longer', 'most', 'warm', 'ups', 'Not', 'big', 'deal', 'now', 'warm', 'up', 'couple', 'minutes', 'own', 'then', 'play', 'workout', 'hit', 'fast', 'forward', ""'ve"", 'done', 'couple', 'minutes', 'so', 'do', ""n't"", 'spend', 'more', 'time', 'needed', 'state', 'rather', 'actual', 'workout', 'especially', ""'m"", 'pressed', 'time', 'Also', 'are', ""n't"", 'good', 'balance', 'point', 'fitness', 'routine', 'may', 'feel', 'tripped', 'up', 'beginning', 'second', 'routine', ""n't"", 'mention', 'simply', 'resting', 'other', 'foot', 'floor', 'rather', 'raising', 'build', 'up', 'balance', 'abilities', 'will', 'will', 'work', 'just', 'fine.CONCLUSION', 'workout', 'favorite', 'results', 'fat', 'muscle', 'instruction', 'excellent', 'Great', 'caloric', 'burn', 'good', 'circuit', 'mix', ""'ll"", 'feel', ""'ll"", 'work.ALTERNATIVES', 'like', 'high', 'calorie', 'burn', 'coupled', 'strength', 'training', 'great', 'instruction', 'dvd', 'may', 'also', 'like:1.Body', 'Jake', 'Total', 'Body', 'Workout2.The', 'Biggest', 'Loser', 'dvds', 'Jillian', 'dvds3.Kathy', 'Smith', 'Build', 'Muscle', 'Shrink', 'Fat4.Crunch', 'Total', 'Resculpt5.Star', 'Trainers', 'Strength']",WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO SCULPT

I love that she switches up the cardio and doesn't repeat the same intervals over and over. It keeps the workout exciting and doesn't allow you to drift off.In addition to the great workouts, the chaptering is fantastic. You have the choice of doing everything (warm up, both routines and cool down), or you can pick just one workout, or you can pick either workout with warm up and cool down. The options are already broken out for you so there's no fiddling around to program your set.Each routine includes strength with cardio intervals and she uses combination moves for double duty effect. Some of these moves are more on the intermediate/advanced side and require good balance, but there is a background exerciser who uses modifications throughout so even someone relatively new to exercise should be able to follow along. I love the yoga-influenced cool down; it's 9 wonderful minutes of stretching and letting go. (Note: The cardio sculpt workouts are about 20 minutes long so adding the warm up and cool down make for a longer, approx. 30 minute, workout.)There's also a bonus abs routine. Again, she doesn't disappoint. It's around 8 minutes and includes some (optional) weighted work as well as toe dips (a personal favorite) and ends with a nice little stretch. Included with the bonus features is a 5-minute preview of the Weight Loss Pilates workout. It's probably one of the most useful previews I've come across as it makes a nice little add-on to the abs.Zaki manages to be tough but encouraging.

I also take live classes of kickboxing and Zumba at least 2 times each week.  I had read the reviews for this DVD and got excited. Plus, it was on sale for 5 bucks.  About 10 min into it, I got extremely bored.  First of all, her cueing stinks.  She changes the move at the same time she cues it so you are trying to catch up.  That is annoying and takes the fun out.  Secondly, the music sucks big time - not motivating at all.  I know that for the most part, workout music on these DVDs is bland but this one...awful! Thirdly, I don't think she does enough reps to really be effective. She tries to be creative with the moves but they end up feeling awkward.  Fourth, she is anorexic looking.  Her body is not inspiring to me.  Her 2 back up girls' bodies look much, much healthier to me.  Last but not least, I had some unusual pain in my back after doing this workout.  Again, I workout everyday so it's not like my body is not used to working out.  I am not sure if the awkward moves did something to my back or not.

1202703,AGOTLW0YFPWSW,B001HZ4K76,transponder,"[6, 6]","I've had this DVD for some time, but felt moved to review it because it has stood the test of time with me:  in fact, I like it better now than when I first used it.Violet Zaki is perfectly charming and cues well.  Always nice to have in an instructor.  She even cracks a few jokes -- not a comedy routine, just some words to make you smile.  Very likeable.The workouts have a nice mixture of cardio and weight training, often together, which is how I like it.Some of the moves, especially the mat work, looked ungainly to me at first, and I tended to skip them.  But now I find myself doing them because -- well, I suppose I'm improving.Flexibility is important in doing these exercises and I like the stretches that Zaki has you do.  Her cool-down is terrific, really enjoyable.There are one or two things she does, for a brief time, such as 'heel digs', that don't really do anything for me, or that make me concerned about my knees (I've had slight injuries), but at those times I just modify the exercise.  I don't feel that a DVD workout is something that I have to follow at all times, chapter and verse, and sometimes I prefer to keep the previous movement going while they move on to something else.  Or I change to heavier weights or keep my weights if they've put theirs down.  Obviously you have to be aware of what you're doing and think of safety, but if you're an experienced exerciser you can spontaneously 'tailor' a workout while still benefitting from having one to follow.As for the reviewer that claims 'I didn't break a sweat', well, congratulations, you must be in excellent shape!  But in that case I don't think this DVD is for you.  As Zaki says throughout the workout, it's for people who want to improve their fitness:  either those 'new to working out' (who may follow the modified movements of one of the women) or those that are up to a lot more but might have some weight to lose.  I am fairly slim, but I like to have this workout as part of my  routine.Highly recommended.",5,One to 'grow' with; a winner,1262822400,"01 7, 2010",2010,2006,"[""'ve"", 'had', 'DVD', 'time', 'felt', 'moved', 'review', 'stood', 'test', 'time', 'fact', 'like', 'better', 'now', 'when', 'first', 'used', 'it.Violet', 'Zaki', 'perfectly', 'charming', 'cues', 'well', 'Always', 'nice', 'have', 'instructor', 'even', 'few', 'jokes', 'not', 'comedy', 'routine', 'just', 'words', 'make', 'smile', 'Very', 'likeable.The', 'workouts', 'have', 'nice', 'mixture', 'cardio', 'weight', 'training', 'often', 'together', 'how', 'like', 'it.Some', 'moves', 'especially', 'mat', 'work', 'looked', 'ungainly', 'first', 'tended', 'skip', 'now', 'find', 'doing', 'well', 'suppose', ""'m"", 'improving.Flexibility', 'important', 'doing', 'exercises', 'like', 'stretches', 'Zaki', 'do', 'cool-down', 'terrific', 'really', 'are', 'one', 'two', 'things', 'brief', 'time', 'such', ""'heel"", 'digs', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'do', 'anything', 'make', 'concerned', 'knees', ""'ve"", 'had', 'slight', 'injuries', 'times', 'just', 'modify', 'exercise', 'do', ""n't"", 'feel', 'DVD', 'workout', 'something', 'have', 'follow', 'times', 'chapter', 'verse', 'sometimes', 'prefer', 'keep', 'previous', 'movement', 'going', 'move', 'something', 'else', 'change', 'heavier', 'weights', 'keep', 'weights', ""'ve"", 'put', 'theirs', 'down', 'Obviously', 'have', 'be', 'aware', 'what', ""'re"", 'doing', 'think', 'safety', ""'re"", 'experienced', 'exerciser', 'can', 'spontaneously', ""'tailor"", 'workout', 'still', 'benefitting', 'having', 'one', 'follow.As', 'reviewer', 'claims', 'did', ""n't"", 'break', 'sweat', 'well', 'congratulations', 'must', 'be', 'excellent', 'shape', 'case', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'DVD', 'Zaki', 'workout', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'improve', 'fitness', ""'new"", 'working', 'out', 'who', 'may', 'follow', 'modified', 'movements', 'one', 'women', 'are', 'up', 'lot', 'more', 'might', 'have', 'weight', 'lose', 'am', 'fairly', 'slim', 'like', 'have', 'workout', 'part', 'routine.Highly', 'recommended']",WEIGHT LOSS CARDIO SCULPT

This one is slightly more difficult than Cardio Kick. It is excellent for sculpting. If you are looking for more cardio work you want to use Cardio Kick instead.I picked this one up when I have achieved a certain fitness level so I have been doing both segments back to back. While it is not the most difficult workouts I have (it targets beginner to intermediate levels), it gets my heart rate up to the target zone and I still work out a sweat. Most importantly, it is very enjoyable. I love working out with Violet. She cues well and is encouraging and pleasant without the annoying chitchats. I wish she makes more DVDs.Last but not the least, the cool-down segment of this DVD is amazing. It's thorough and relaxing and stretches all the major muscles.
