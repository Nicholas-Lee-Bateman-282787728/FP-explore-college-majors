This silly little film represents at least a minor landmark in cinema history and now that it's available on DVD, everyone can judge for themselves.  Schlock doesn't begin to describe the technical aspects, but Cindy Williams is a delight as Rosie the Secretary, giving a performance alternately subtle and outrageous. Years of Laverne and Shirley may have done more harm than good to her overall reputation, but this film shows that she could have been the equal of Goldie Hawn in films.Lots of special features in the DVD (including several Easter Eggs), but grab one soon, as the bonus soundtrack CD will not be included in later pressings.",3,Cult musical comedy finally available and worth the wait,1024963200,"06 25, 2002",2002,729,"['original', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'technical', 'quality', 'not', 'issue', 'here', 'silly', 'little', 'film', 'least', 'minor', 'landmark', 'cinema', 'history', 'now', 'available', 'DVD', 'everyone', 'can', 'judge', 'Schlock', ""n't"", 'begin', 'describe', 'technical', 'aspects', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'delight', 'Rosie', 'Secretary', 'giving', 'performance', 'alternately', 'subtle', 'outrageous', 'Years', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'may', 'have', 'done', 'more', 'harm', 'good', 'overall', 'reputation', 'film', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'equal', 'Goldie', 'Hawn', 'films.Lots', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'including', 'several', 'Easter', 'Eggs', 'grab', 'one', 'soon', 'bonus', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'included', 'later', 'pressings']",The First Nudie Musical

700809,A24Z6PF3RTPDVX,B000066742,D. Clancy,"[6, 8]","When this little film  turned up in 1975 I was living in one of the few cities it was first released to.  I remember sitting in a huge theatre with 9 other people and we were all howling our heads off.  The run was about 2 weeks and I saw this movie 11 times.  In the ensuing years I taped it on cable.  My video tape is wearing out and this DVD is like Christmas Day.The main feature is in remarkably good shape.  In an interview writer, director and producer Bruce Kimmel said that the master was literally unusable in some areas.  It had to be completely rebuilt.  The joys of the digital age. In a nutshell it centers around a movie studio that is going to be reposessed unless they put on a movie that is a success.  The brilliant young head of the studio decides a porno nude film  would put them in the black. One of the creditors insists that his nephew direct the film.  Just the beginning of the trouble.  A colorful, funny group of characters sing and dance their way across the screen for 94 minutes.  It is a truly funny movie. ""Dancing Dildos"" is a hoot.Also on this DVD is the standard photo gallery, theatrical trailer.  However a ""making"" of the film documentary is very funny indeed.  Great interviews and film scenes with Cindy Williams, Bruce Kimmel, Stephen Nathan and others associated with the film.  Rumor has it that Ms Williams wanted to buy every print of the film after Laverne and Shirley became popular.Also included in this deluxe package is a cd of the soundtrack.  It has a very funny, bright melodious score.  In fact, it would make a great Broadway musical.  What a novel idea.If you want to have a fun 2 hours watch ""The First Nudie Musical"".",5,Christmas came early with this DVD,1025136000,"06 27, 2002",2002,1678,"['When', 'little', 'film', 'turned', 'up', '1975', 'was', 'living', 'one', 'few', 'cities', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'remember', 'sitting', 'huge', 'theatre', '9', 'other', 'people', 'were', 'howling', 'heads', 'off', 'run', 'was', 'about', '2', 'weeks', 'saw', 'movie', '11', 'times', 'ensuing', 'years', 'taped', 'cable', 'video', 'tape', 'wearing', 'out', 'DVD', 'Christmas', 'Day.The', 'main', 'feature', 'remarkably', 'good', 'shape', 'interview', 'writer', 'director', 'producer', 'Bruce', 'Kimmel', 'said', 'master', 'was', 'literally', 'unusable', 'areas', 'had', 'be', 'completely', 'rebuilt', 'joys', 'digital', 'age', 'nutshell', 'movie', 'studio', 'going', 'be', 'reposessed', 'put', 'movie', 'success', 'brilliant', 'young', 'head', 'studio', 'porno', 'nude', 'film', 'would', 'put', 'black', 'One', 'creditors', 'nephew', 'direct', 'film', 'Just', 'beginning', 'trouble', 'colorful', 'funny', 'group', 'characters', 'sing', 'dance', 'way', 'screen', '94', 'minutes', 'truly', 'funny', 'movie', 'Dancing', 'Dildos', 'hoot.Also', 'DVD', 'standard', 'photo', 'gallery', 'theatrical', 'trailer', 'However', 'making', 'film', 'documentary', 'very', 'funny', 'indeed', 'Great', 'interviews', 'film', 'scenes', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'Bruce', 'Kimmel', 'Stephen', 'Nathan', 'others', 'associated', 'film', 'Rumor', 'Ms', 'Williams', 'wanted', 'buy', 'print', 'film', 'Laverne', 'Shirley', 'became', 'popular.Also', 'included', 'deluxe', 'package', 'cd', 'soundtrack', 'very', 'funny', 'bright', 'melodious', 'score', 'fact', 'would', 'make', 'great', 'Broadway', 'musical', 'What', 'novel', 'idea.If', 'want', 'have', 'fun', '2', 'hours', 'watch', 'First', 'Nudie', 'Musical']",The First Nudie Musical
700810,A14NAEWHKBW1NF,B000066742,"hippiedj ""hippiedj""","[29, 34]","This is my all-time favorite film!The First Nudie Musical has held its own for all these years by word of mouth and undoubtedly many pirated copies on vhs made the rounds since it was so hard to find.  Even Paramount let it go to at least two other video companies I know of, and the last vhs release of it a few years ago was a collector's item in the fact that it contained the ""plumber scene"" which is now included on this DVD release as part of the deleted scenes.  It's so good to see that people have cherished this film and are doing it great justice by giving us so much on this DVD.I have been a true fan of this modest classic, telling everyone I know about it and forcing them to see it.  No one to this day has been disappointed, especially if you appreciate extreme camp and honest to goodness silliness.  The film is aware of its own low budget and uses that to its advantage, as one film critic once said ""it was made for one percent of the budget of New York, New York and is a hundred times funnier!""  It transcends the boundaries of a T&A; comedy by actually appealing to anyone with a giddy sense of humor, straight or gay.  Cindy Williams has always had a special place in my heart after seeing her performance in this film, she is top-notch here!  SHE makes this film a complete experience, besides the charming and very funny Diana Canova's character of Juanita Juanita.  And watch out for that very funny brief cameo by Ron Howard!The early pressings of the DVD contain the soundtrack on CD -- what a welcome sight since I have held on to my vinyl copy of the soundtrack since it was released in 1977! Many will want this especially for the fact that Annette O'Toole was the singing voice behind the song The Lights And The Smiles! This may sound corny, but with the DVD release of The First Nudie Musical and its soundtrack right now, I feel life has come full circle for me.  This has been my all-time favorite film since its theatrical release back in 1976, and I urge everyone to pay their respects and buy this DVD!  You'll be glad you did and find yourself saying what Juanita Juanita said: ""It's just so BIG!""",5,A true classic is finally given proper respect !,1028160000,"08 1, 2002",2002,2139,"['all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'First', 'Nudie', 'Musical', 'held', 'own', 'years', 'word', 'mouth', 'undoubtedly', 'many', 'pirated', 'copies', 'vhs', 'made', 'rounds', 'was', 'so', 'hard', 'find', 'Even', 'Paramount', 'let', 'go', 'least', 'two', 'other', 'video', 'companies', 'know', 'last', 'vhs', 'release', 'few', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'collector', 'item', 'fact', 'contained', 'plumber', 'scene', 'now', 'included', 'DVD', 'release', 'part', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'so', 'good', 'see', 'people', 'have', 'cherished', 'film', 'are', 'doing', 'great', 'justice', 'giving', 'so', 'much', 'DVD.I', 'have', 'been', 'true', 'fan', 'modest', 'classic', 'telling', 'everyone', 'know', 'forcing', 'see', 'one', 'day', 'been', 'disappointed', 'especially', 'appreciate', 'extreme', 'camp', 'honest', 'goodness', 'silliness', 'film', 'aware', 'own', 'low', 'budget', 'advantage', 'one', 'film', 'critic', 'once', 'said', 'was', 'made', 'one', 'percent', 'budget', 'New', 'York', 'New', 'York', 'hundred', 'times', 'funnier', 'boundaries', 'T', 'A', 'comedy', 'actually', 'appealing', 'anyone', 'giddy', 'sense', 'humor', 'straight', 'gay', 'Cindy', 'Williams', 'always', 'had', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'seeing', 'performance', 'film', 'top-notch', 'here', 'SHE', 'film', 'complete', 'experience', 'charming', 'very', 'funny', 'Diana', 'Canova', 'character', 'Juanita', 'Juanita', 'watch', 'out', 'very', 'funny', 'brief', 'cameo', 'Ron', 'Howard', 'early', 'pressings', 'DVD', 'contain', 'soundtrack', 'CD', 'what', 'welcome', 'sight', 'have', 'held', 'vinyl', 'copy', 'soundtrack', 'was', 'released', '1977', 'Many', 'will', 'want', 'especially', 'fact', 'Annette', ""O'Toole"", 'was', 'singing', 'voice', 'song', 'Lights', 'Smiles', 'may', 'sound', 'corny', 'DVD', 'release', 'First', 'Nudie', 'Musical', 'soundtrack', 'right', 'now', 'feel', 'life', 'come', 'full', 'circle', 'been', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'film', 'theatrical', 'release', 'back', '1976', 'urge', 'everyone', 'pay', 'respects', 'buy', 'DVD', ""'ll"", 'be', 'glad', 'did', 'find', 'saying', 'what', 'Juanita', 'Juanita', 'said', 'just', 'so', 'BIG']",The First Nudie Musical
700811,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B000066742,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[1, 1]","One of the greatest aspects of the DVD format is that it has brought underground cult films to a mass audience. No longer do you have to wonder about the oddball titles you've only heard about or that you've always wanted to see. These films might have been screened in large cities, but soon disappeared only to be whispered about nostalgically or forgotten completely. In my collection, I have two such films--musicals with rabidly supportive fan bases. And while I admire elements of both films, viewed with modern eyes--they are largely notable for their historic curiosity factor only.""The First Nudie Musical,"" from 1975, is a slight and amusing romp about a filmmaker trying to save his studio by making an ADULT musical. A spoof of conventional ""let's put on a show!"" type movie musicals--the film's humor is sweeter than you might imagine from it's title. In fact, most of the supposed outrageousness is saved for the actual production numbers. With corny costumes, mildly titillating lyrics, and nice sight gags--these songs can be fun if inconsequential. Taken out of it's time period, however, there is nothing particularly shocking about this picture. There is plenty of non-sexual nudity, if you didn't guess that from the title. It is interesting to see Cindy Williams and Diana Canova before they went on to become sitcom stars. Everyone is game and the mood is light. You might chuckle a few times, but it's a low budget affair that's just isn't as funny as you would hope.""The Apple,"" from 1980, has different aspirations--but elicits some of the same emotions. This is a rock opera spoof set to a sci-fi beat. With campy costumes, bad power ballads, and a classic struggle between good and evil--this film assaults your senses. It bludgeons you with it's very nature. When a young innocent singer is seduced by fame and fortune and the devilish Mr. Boogalow--it's up to her folksinging partner to save her soul and all of humanity. Designed to be outrageous, it was likely a spectacle when it premiered. Time, however, has dulled some of its glitter--and again, you might be wishing the film were a bit funnier than it actually is.I think both of these musicals have intrinsic historical value. I love things that try to push the boundaries of mainstream film. For film lovers or curiosity seekers, I recommend you check out either or both films--if they sound interesting. My lower ratings are more for the casual viewer. As satire, spoof or camp--in their day--these films were noteworthy. To a modern audience, they might just seem bad. But if they were meant to be bad, does that make them good? That's a conundrum I leave at your feet.

Fuke,"[2, 3]","Movie rates 3 of 5 stars; DVD transfer rates 4stars.FNM is probably the strangest movie to have debuted in 1976.The biggest name star is Cindy Williams.  She had just comeoff a feature role in that star-maker, American Graffiti, and did not need the billing and salary to make ends meet.  Was she contractually committed to this turkey role?She plays it deadpan throughout, and looked as though she wanted to be anywhere but on the movie set.  However, her approach really worked.  She was a hoot, intentionally or otherwise. Diana Canova was another familiar performer; she sported the phoniest Latin accent in movie history. Neither ""name star"" actually gets naked - be forewarned.The movie is suitably low-budget, and especially costuming -in all its jiggling glory.  True to its title, it is a musical.  ""Dancing Dildoes"" is the number that says it all.  The chorerograhy and lyrics sound like a third grader's first attempt at staging.  The sight of a chorus line of condoms prancing about is painfully memorable.DD was unusual because the chorus line was costumed. Most otherscenes had naked ladies.  In fact, the Stunt C*ck was possibly theonly naked male.Am I glad I went?  Well, I had just been discharged from theAir Force.  Some of the enlisted guys dragged me to the theater;I think they needed their ex-captain to cover their evening out.I will never forget the scene in which the director tells a perfectlylovely blonde, of course stark naked, to fake an orgasm.  Trulydreadful acting was never funnier.  Then too, the reaction from guysin the unit also lent humor to the moment.So, you pays your money and takes your chances on this one.There are some knock-down funny, arse-grabbing bits in this film.You just might hate yourself in the morning though.  All the actresses are now in their middle-50's and probably grandmothers by now.
