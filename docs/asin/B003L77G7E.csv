The only downside is that you could tell Charlie Sheen was having issues. In some of the episodes where he was supposedly drunk and disagreeable, the &#34;acting&#34; seemed a bit too realistic. Obviously, the end of his time on the show came too abruptly for them to really work out the transition, but it wasn't bad all things considered. If you like the show, this season is just as worthwhile as the previous ones.",4,Good season but...,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",2014,521,"['season', 'had', 'lot', 'good', 'episodes', 'story', 'lines', 'continued', 'be', 'classic', 'Two', 'Half', 'Men', 'only', 'downside', 'could', 'tell', 'Charlie', 'Sheen', 'was', 'having', 'issues', 'episodes', 'where', 'was', 'supposedly', 'drunk', 'disagreeable', '34', 'acting', '34', 'seemed', 'bit', 'too', 'realistic', 'Obviously', 'end', 'time', 'show', 'came', 'too', 'abruptly', 'really', 'work', 'out', 'transition', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'things', 'considered', 'like', 'show', 'season', 'just', 'as', 'worthwhile', 'previous', 'ones']",N/A
