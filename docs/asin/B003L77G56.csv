1351057,A1DD15RXIXWENM,B003L77G56,"Anton Beat Riess ""Toni Riess""","[1, 2]","During the german TV has cancled ""Brothers & Sisters"" after only 10 episodes of the first season I bought now all 5 season on amazon.com. Except of ""Desperate Housewives"" this is one of the most interesting drama series with a outstanding / sensational Cast: Sally Field, Luke MacFarlane, Matthew Rhys... to call only a few of them.  I was shocked when I heard the show cancled. So I was a little bit scared to watching the 5th season - because I don't want believe it would be the end after.The show has: very good dialogues and very good acting. The best scene are between Matthew Rhys and Luke MacFarlane during a fighten of their relationship. Its really heartbreaking. I truly cried and got tears. The same happened in the 3rd last episodes when Ron Rifkins character is reading a letter of his mother. It's very emotional. And of course at the end of the final episode.Kevin and Scotty are the most interesting gay couple on TV without to falling in any gay-clich&egrave; and I really would like to see a sort of spin-off of both (like in any internet-forum are debating about that both moving to New York, open a new Restaurant, new friends etc.) But well... just a thoughts.As guest and returning we will see one time again Balthazar Getty as Tommy and again in a few episodes Ken Olin (where is also the producer of the show) including Patricia Wettig (where is also his real-life wife). As special guest we will see Richard Chamberlain as Jonathan and Beau Bridges as Brody.New cuties for a 2 episodes: Robert Kazinsky as Rick and for 4 episodes: Jeremy Davidson (from ""Army Wives"" and ""Pan Am"")THE DVD:Picture quality (Widescreen 1.78:1) and Sound (Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound) are again very good. The serie is subtitled  in english, french and spanishBonus-Features: Deleted Scenes, Bloopers & Outtakes, Gilles Marini: UNcovered, Writing for the Walkers (running only a few minutes between 5 and 10 minutes) plus any Audio-Commentaries.FAZIT: very emotional, heartbreaking and also funny serie -  I WILL MISS THE WALKERS (specially Kevin & Scotty)",5,The 5th and Final Season,1317600000,"10 3, 2011",2011,2065,"['german', 'TV', 'cancled', 'Brothers', 'Sisters', 'only', '10', 'episodes', 'first', 'season', 'bought', 'now', '5', 'season', 'amazon.com', 'Desperate', 'Housewives', 'one', 'most', 'interesting', 'drama', 'series', 'outstanding', '/', 'sensational', 'Cast', 'Sally', 'Field', 'Luke', 'MacFarlane', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'call', 'only', 'few', 'was', 'shocked', 'when', 'heard', 'show', 'cancled', 'was', 'little', 'bit', 'scared', 'watching', '5th', 'season', 'do', ""n't"", 'want', 'believe', 'would', 'be', 'end', 'after.The', 'show', 'very', 'good', 'dialogues', 'very', 'good', 'acting', 'best', 'scene', 'are', 'Matthew', 'Rhys', 'Luke', 'MacFarlane', 'fighten', 'relationship', 'really', 'heartbreaking', 'truly', 'cried', 'got', 'tears', 'same', 'happened', '3rd', 'last', 'episodes', 'when', 'Ron', 'Rifkins', 'character', 'reading', 'letter', 'mother', 'very', 'emotional', 'course', 'end', 'final', 'episode.Kevin', 'Scotty', 'are', 'most', 'interesting', 'gay', 'couple', 'TV', 'falling', 'gay-clich', 'egrave', 'really', 'would', 'like', 'see', 'sort', 'spin-off', 'internet-forum', 'are', 'debating', 'moving', 'New', 'York', 'open', 'new', 'Restaurant', 'new', 'friends', 'etc', 'well', 'just', 'thoughts.As', 'guest', 'returning', 'will', 'see', 'one', 'time', 'again', 'Balthazar', 'Getty', 'Tommy', 'again', 'few', 'episodes', 'Ken', 'Olin', 'where', 'also', 'producer', 'show', 'including', 'Patricia', 'Wettig', 'where', 'also', 'real-life', 'wife', 'special', 'guest', 'will', 'see', 'Richard', 'Chamberlain', 'Jonathan', 'Beau', 'Bridges', 'Brody.New', 'cuties', '2', 'episodes', 'Robert', 'Kazinsky', 'Rick', '4', 'episodes', 'Jeremy', 'Davidson', 'Army', 'Wives', 'Pan', 'Am', 'THE', 'DVD', 'Picture', 'quality', 'Widescreen', '1.78:1', 'Sound', 'Dolby', 'Digital', '5.1', 'Surround', 'Sound', 'are', 'again', 'very', 'good', 'serie', 'subtitled', 'english', 'french', 'spanishBonus-Features', 'Deleted', 'Scenes', 'Bloopers', 'Outtakes', 'Gilles', 'Marini', 'UNcovered', 'Writing', 'Walkers', 'running', 'only', 'few', 'minutes', '5', '10', 'minutes', 'plus', 'Audio-Commentaries.FAZIT', 'very', 'emotional', 'heartbreaking', 'also', 'funny', 'serie', 'WILL', 'MISS', 'THE', 'WALKERS', 'specially', 'Kevin', 'Scotty']",N/A

It should have ended after the fourth season. The fifth season is really disjointed with plot lines that seem out of place. Oh, it is a pot-boiler from the beginning, but it's an enjoyable pot-boiler until Lowe keft the series. He brought credibility to an otherwise daytime soap. And yes, you do want to kill the gay brother, because he is a total jerk throughout, but even he became a little more sane when he went to work for the Senator played by Lowe. Watch the first four seasons and forget the fifth unless you have consumed a fifth beforehand and don't know what you're watching.",4,Excellent Until Rob Lowe Left,1329350400,"02 16, 2012",2012,696,"['series', 'excellent', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'left', 'fourth', 'season', 'went', 'down', 'hill', 'hurry', 'should', 'have', 'ended', 'fourth', 'season', 'fifth', 'season', 'really', 'disjointed', 'plot', 'lines', 'seem', 'place', 'Oh', 'pot-boiler', 'beginning', 'enjoyable', 'pot-boiler', 'Lowe', 'keft', 'series', 'brought', 'credibility', 'otherwise', 'daytime', 'soap', 'yes', 'do', 'want', 'kill', 'gay', 'brother', 'total', 'jerk', 'even', 'became', 'little', 'more', 'sane', 'when', 'went', 'work', 'Senator', 'played', 'Lowe', 'Watch', 'first', 'four', 'seasons', 'forget', 'fifth', 'have', 'consumed', 'fifth', 'beforehand', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', ""'re"", 'watching']",N/A

For a TV series, ""Brothers and Sisters"" has always looked good.  The series has a lot of lighting, especially outdoor shots, so for the most part, picture quality for a TV series on DVD, ""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth and Final Season"" looks very good.There are a lot of outdoor and indoor shots and ""Brothers and Sisters"" does have quite a bit of grain but nothing too distracting. But for the most part, picture quality is very good.AUDIO:""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth and Final Season"" is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, the show is mostly dialogue-based but there are quite a bit of music featured in the episodes, but the audio is pretty much front and center channel driven and audio is clear. There are no really need for major sound effects for ""Brothers and Sisters"" but for the most part, dialogue and background music are heard quite clearly.My receiver setup preference was set to ""Stereo on all Channels"" for a much more immersive soundtrack.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth Season"" comes with the following special features:DISC 1:Deleted Scenes - A total of two deleted scenes: ""You're Really Leaving"" and ""True Wreckage"".DISC 2:Deleted Scenes - A total of two deleted scenes: ""taking sides"" and ""let's get started"".DISC 3:Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for ""Cold Turkey"" with Production Coordinator Jonathan Deiner, Co-Producer Stephen Judge and Producer Nicole Carrasco.DISC 4:Deleted Scenes- Featuring one deleted scene ""We Could Lose Her"".Audio Commentary - Featuring audio commentary for ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" with Production Coordinator Jonathan Deiner, Co-Producer Stephen Judge and Producer Nicole Carrasco.DISC 5:Gilles Marini Uncovered  - (6:06) An interview with the cast about Gilles Marini (Luc) joining the cast of ""Brothers & Sisters"".Writing for the Walkers - (10:00) The writers of ""Brothers and Sisters"" talk about the episodes of season five.Deleted Scenes - A total of one deleted scene and one alternate ending: ""extremely awake"" and ""alternate ending: An Engagement Ring""Bloopers & Outtakes - (2:20) Outtakes from season five of ""Brothers and Sisters"".EXTRAS:""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth and Final Season"" comes with a slip over case.JUDGMENT CALL:With the last season of ""Brothers and Sisters"", I have commented of how the last season was the best season ever!Every episode was well-written and the season finale was an absolute shocker!  But prior to the fifth season, it was a given that Rob Lowe would not return but with news that Patricia Wettig (Holly Harper) and Emily VanCamp (Rebecca Harper) were leaving the show, needless to say, it put a damper on my excitement for the fifth season.By the end of the fifth season, as things have ended with a good season finale, ""Brothers and Sisters"" was canceled.  The producers tried to get a shortened sixth season to end the season with closure for the fans but unfortunately, they were denied.So, I do have a small bittersweet feeling about ""Brothers and Sisters"" because I felt that I invested watching five seasons of this series and one can only imagine how the producers and writers would have ended the series, but there were a few loose ends that I wished were touched upon.But with the way the season ended, I suppose it works as a series finale and does end on a good note, but this is the nature of the business when it comes to television series and ""Brothers and Sisters"" has come to an end.I will say that I will miss the Walker family.  As one friend told me, ""Brothers and Sisters"" was a show that she can watch on her DVR on the weekend, drink fine wine and enjoy the series.  I happen to agree with what she told me because the series was fun, granted, the series had its share of emotional highs and lows that comes along with a dysfunctional family but the Walker family were resilient.  They confronted their issues and challenges, like many American's they faced a bad economy, ending of a business, health problems, adoption, surrogate mothers, raising children, finding love, crumbling of a relationship, starting over, rebuilding and like all family's, having their fights and bonding moments.Among the many ABC family one-hour drama series, ""Brothers and Sisters"" was probably one that was easily accessible because their issues and challenges are real and people can identify with these characters because despite them being from a slightly upperclassed American family, the Walker family was far from perfect, they are no different from anyone else.While ""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth Season"" was an entertaining final season, of course, because of the insurmountable challenges faced in the last season, season four was just incredible but there was no way to pull of something that emotional and tragic for a second year straight.  You needed some normalcy, real problems and that's viewers got with season five.  Nora, single mother trying to find love.  Sarah, aging sister getting married but also dealing with a teenage daughter.  Kitty, dealing with the death of her husband, but also finding love once again.  Kevin and Scotty dealing with adoption and trying to keep their marriage alive.  And Justin, the person who had to get away from life by re-enlisting in the marines and leaving his family but returning back to find out that the sacrifice he made to get back his sanity came with a price.But I have always felt the series was well-written, well-cast and while last year was spectacular, I admit that I was a bit upset of the direction of the Justin and Rebecca storyline hitting a dead end before the fifth season even started, but after the events that have taken place at the end of season four, I found it interesting that the one person who was instrumental in making things right was Justin, especially since he was somewhat of the problematic character because of what happened during his last enlistment with the Marines.But like for everyone in the series and how things have played out for this fifth season, it was important to show that families must go on living.  And so in hindsight, after watching every episode and thinking about the fifth season, despite my feeling before the series began, Now that it is done, I'm actually content with how everything had ended.Overall, ""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth and Final Season"" marks the end of a pretty solid drama series.  Fun, enjoyable and emotional...I'll miss this series!It's shame that ""Brothers and Sisters"" didn't get the chance to end the way the producers/writers probably would have wanted if given that shortened sixth season.  But yet they managed to give a season finale that does provide some closure and enough to know that the Walker family has embarked in a new chapter of their lives and like all families with problems and taking care of those problems, they'll be OK.  And like all families, we continue living with our highs and our lows but we keep on going, living life day-by-day.There are a good number of special features included with this final season DVD set but for the most part, as a fan and viewer of ""Brothers and Sisters"", it was an emotional roller coaster ride that has come to a close.If you invested your time into watching this series or a person who has just jumped aboard and is interested in the series, ""Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth and Final Season"" is recommended!",4,"Brothers and Sisters - The Complete Fifth and Final Season"" is entertaining, fun, emotional but overall a good conclusion.",1315180800,"09 5, 2011",2011,11322,"['Brothers', 'Sisters', 'show', 'created', 'back', '2006', 'Jon', 'Robin', 'Baitz',

Robert is being kept on life-support in a vegetative state while Kitty dithers about pulling the plug. Holly suffered memory loss and does not even recall her own identity. As the season starts Justin returns from yet a third tour of duty in Afghanistan, a decision that led to his his wife divorcing him. Nora meanwhile tries out for and lands a gigue as a radio advice commentator--Dear Mum. Sarah has made $50 million on the lakeland property and is trying to decide to marry her French Artist Boyfriend, Saul and  Scottie are running a restaurant while his partner Kevin runs a pro bono law clinic and the pair look to adopt. Tommy is still shiftless and flits in and out. Kittie takes on a college teaching position and starts up an affair with a young stud who works at the local coffee bar and proves to be the Dean&#8217;s Son. Does it all sound familiar?Somehow the season gets off to a slow start especially since the jump in time leads to some confusion. New characters and old flames get introduced. Confidentiality is an impossibility in this family where the telephone and conference calls play a key role in their lives. They may not always like one another but there&#8217;s no denying their love. The season ends with an episode punningly entitled Walker Down the Aisle.
