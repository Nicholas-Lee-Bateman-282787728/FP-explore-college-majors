In all the movies I've seen...this is my favorite. The effects, the music, the actors...everything is top  rate...with the exception of the man who plays Randall Flag. Not a man I  would choose as evil...he's way too clownish for my taste. Gary Sinise is  remarkable. If you're a Sinise fan...sit through the 6 hours..you won't be  dissappointed. The beginning of the movie can't be discribed. It is the  most visual display of death you will ever see. Although this means the  movie is NOT meant for young children...stick to 15 yrs. and up. I enjoyed  this movie so much I ran out and bought the unedited version of the  book..($65.00)worth. Now that is something I never do...I'm not a big  reading fan. I usually stick to reading things that aren't movies or save  it for extremely exceptional works. Never have I watched the movie and then  decided to read the book.

360690,A1AXHNRDJEQ0B,6303153461,Adi Adler,"[3, 4]","Since this movie is based on a novel that is over a 1000 pages long in paperback, so they had to cut quite a few scenes, characters and situations from it. This movie is pretty long as it is... some of the cuts made were predictable, such as Stu's group encounter with the 'zoo' (if you're wondering what that is - read the book!). But as it is, we don't get to see all the characters develop as they are in the book. Larry's character in the bppk, for instance, had changed from being a selfish young man who had only thought about himself, to a responsible adult. The movie doesn't give us a reason to understand why Larry was chosen over many other, seemingly equal people, to serve in the Free Zone committee, but in the book, even though we don't see him lead his group to Boluder, we hear enough to understand that he has leadership qualities in him. Another example would be Harold's character - he was a fat geek that was laughed at in school and treated as an outcast even by his parents, who obviously loved his sister Amy much better. Add to that the fact that Amy was Frannie's best friend and both were part of the popular crowd, and you see a much stronger motivation for Harold for wanting to impress Frannie, and having her for himself. This isn't a crush, as the movie tries to portray, but for Harold Frannie is a symbol of all he was missing before the plague, and now that things have changed, he wants to get. In the book, you get a much better sense of why Harold is so angry and eventually turns against the zone. When he finally seems to have a chance to change things - he's gotten Frannie's attention and appreciation for the way he handles the post - plague world - Stu and Glen come in, and he's no longer the center of things. This is how he feels about not being included in the Free Zone committee - after proving his resourcefulness on the trip to Boulder. Only before he dies does the book version Harold realize that he had a potential place as an important figure in the community if he hadn't 'turned bad'.This brings me to the 2nd reason for disliking this movie: Molly Ringwald as Frannie. Her shoulder length black dyed hair is awful, especially since the book version Frannie is a read head, just like Molly... But this is a minor detail compared to what she did with Frannie: instead of a resourceful young woman, we get a stupid, silly girl who only cares about chasing Stu and wearing pretty clothes (that are not very practicall for a long trip on a motorcycle, by the way). When she reacts to Mother Abagail's request that the 4 men walk to Las Vegas, we see the reaction of a spoiled child, not the reaction of a strong minded young woman who is about to have a baby, and wants her loved one around then. We don't see her changing attitudes towards Harold: from thinking of him as a rude & dirty minded geek in the pre plague days to admiring his resourcefullness, then to fearing his reaction to her & Stu's relationship, then to a creepy feeling when she sees how he deals with it... These are only some examples of many things that Frannie goes through, but Molly Ringwald doesn't portray very well well. All other actors and actresses had to deal with the limitations of the cut script, but luckily for us viewers, only Molly Ringwald had a problem dealing with her character... Another feminine mis portrayed character is Nadine Cross, even though the casting for her was perfrct. Actually, the movie version Nadine was a combination of 2 characters in the book: the sophisticated New Yorker Rita Blakemoore,who eventually 'ran out' on Larry by ODing on pills (and this being a turning point for Larry), and Nadine Cross, a woman he had met on the way. Since the book version of Nadine was not commited to being the sophisticated New Yorker, we are introduced to her as a quiet & good woman (she's the one who found Joe, and took care of him at first, not Lucy), but then learn she's haunted by the Dark Man since childhood, and is slowly being drawn to him. We understand her dislike for going to Nebraska and her death a lot better in this light...I had a huge problem with the commentary. It's obvious that it's been done in a few sessions, because a few of the stories (especially Ruby Dee's husband getting the role of Judge Ferris) were repeated over and over again. Also, towards the end, a few of the scenes had any commentary in them, and the little there was to say was over discussed and over analyzed. I understand it's hard to do a commentary for such a long movie, so maybe they should have had another 'extra' of commentary on certain scenes or characters instead of having one over the whole movie. Another problem, common to quite a lot of DVD commentaries that are done by more than one person is the constant babble of how great everyone was, etc. There were very few enlightening bits of information, such as Rob Lowe's explanation of how he prepared for the role of Nick.",3,Pretty good movie considering the limitations...,1009843200,"01 1, 2002",2002,4943,"['movie', 'based', 'novel',

360691,A1A87TUBBDPMF0,6303153461,"Alex Diaz-Granados ""fardreaming writer""","[180, 186]","Hailed as one of the best fantasy/horror novels ever written, Stephen King's The Stand has been published in two different versions -- a slimmed down original edition in 1978 and a slightly updated and unabridged version in 1991.  And although both stick to the same story -- a U.S. government-created strain of the flu wipes out 99% of humanity and the survivors join two opposing camps in the ultimate face-off between good and evil -- they differ somewhat, particularly at the very end.Of all of King's novels, The Stand is the one most of his readers ask about or comment on, and until 1994, when ABC commissioned a miniseries based on this sprawling opus, one question always was &quot;Will there be a movie based on this one?&quot;  (King replied in the foreword to the &quot;uncut and unabridged&quot; edition that he thought there might be...)Unlike most of King's novels, the sheer scope of the novel guaranteed that The Stand would have to be a miniseries made for TV.  To have compressed the 1,000-plus pages into a three-hour movie would have been impossible without deleting many characters and situations, a very risky proposition since The Stand is to King's legions of fans what The Lord of the Rings is to Tolkien's readers. And to have hired someone else to adapt it from book to teleplay would have been a risky proposition, so ABC asked King to take the writing reins.Happily, the 1994 &quot;Stephen King's The Stand&quot; turned out to be a marvelous miniseries, and while it did not break any Nielsen ratings as &quot;Alex Haley's Roots&quot; did in 1977, it did fairly well and earned many good reviews.The Artisan Home Entertainment Special Edition DVD of &quot;Stephen King's The Stand&quot; presents the complete miniseries on two DVDs, with The Plague and The Dreams on Disc One and The Betrayal and The Stand on Disc Two.  Stripped of commercials and station identification/local news promos, the eight-hour running time is pared down to 366 minutes.Parts One and Two (The Plague, The Dreams) deal with the accidental release of a super-deadly strain of the flu from a secret military laboratory known as Project Blue. Although the base's security attempts to lock down the facility before the virus escapes, one guard and panics attempts to flee, unwittingly infecting his wife and daughter and beginning a chain reaction that will lead to the deaths of millions.  Even so, a handful of people survive, and as they try to cope with the disaster and move on, they are guided by their dreams to join either the evil Randall Flagg  or the good 106-year-old Mother Abigail.  While Flagg sets up his police-state in Sin City itself, Las Vegas, the good guys (and gals) set up the Boulder Free Zone in Colorado...but this is only the setup for the darker conflict to come.Parts Three and Four (The Betrayal, The Stand) describe the apocalyptic conflict between good and evil as Flagg's people race to acquire weapons of mass destruction to assure their demonic master's victory over the power of the Light side represented by the Boulder Free Zone.  Flagg, who was seen only in a few brief scenes in the first half, gets more airtime as the story finally focuses on the final conflict.  It's an old storytelling technique but it works well here, and Jamey Sheridan (Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent) plays the evil demon with a mixture of charm and menace.Despite the leeway allowed by the miniseries format and unusually open-mindedness from ABC's Standards and Practices division, the teleplay more closely follows the 1978 version rather the 1991 edition, particularly in the ending.  King has to compress some parts here, combine some characters there to make the miniseries flow seamlessly and not go over budget (If ABC had commissioned a 12-hour teleplay, maybe the condensing would not have been necessary, but that's Monday-morning quarterbacking 10 years after the show aired).  Even so, The Stand captures the spirit of the novel brilliantly.Credit is also due to director Mick Garris, who not only got great performances from such actors as Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Jamey Sheridan, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Ray Walston and Rob Lowe, but also kept the huge storyline from dragging or getting too heavy-handed on the gross-out scale.Even though Artisan did give The Stand the Special Edition treatment by adding such features as 2.0 Dolby Surround sound, a &quot;Making of&quot; featurette and commentary by King, Garris, some of the major cast and Editor Pat McMahon (just to name a few of the extras), it doesn't have easily accessed subtitles.  It does have closed captions, but for people with older models of TVs and non-standard players such as Xbox or Playstation 2 game systems that can also play DVDs this is not a very helpful option.",4,"King's &quot;The Stand&quot; sets up final conflict between good, evil",1073174400,"01 4, 2004",2004,4779,"['Hailed', 'one', 'best', 'fantasy/horror', 'novels', 'ever', 'written',

Grindle ""Andre' Grindle""","[3, 12]","For a made for TV miniseries 'The Stand' ranks among the higher quality.We all know the plot I'm sure:a government created supervirus called 'Captain Tibbs' kills off 99 % of the human race except a scattered few hundred immune survivors.Some dream of and seek out a heavenly elder named Mother Abigal (marvelously played by the late great Ruby Dee) or the devilish Randall Flagg.It's an exellent plot with some great cast members but....1:) WHAT IS GARY SINISE DOING IN A TV MOVIE?I would think he'd be a little beyond it as a proffessional Hollywood actor.But despite having just gotton off of 'Apollo 13' his performance does it for me of all the actors.2:)The first segment 'The Pleague'does'nt flow well onto the next segment 'The Dreams'.The plot seems a bit hurried.A virus is unleashed in rural Texas,it's contained but somehow it leaks out all over the counrty and all of a suddenly people in LA,New York and Maine are getting it.All of a sudden in 'The Dream' everyone has completely parished.It's as if the first segment was Step 1 and the second was Step 3.My guess:the burning of the flu victims bodies caused the virus to become airborn?Whatever.3:) On the same (and a better note) the hysteria created by the superflu is scarry and riveting.Those who don't succomb to the flu are killed in massive street riots by or military troops who declare martial law.It's a scarrily realistic apocolyptic nightmare in the finest X-Files tradition.The whole first part generally deals with hysteria and is the scarriest part of the whole series.Problem is.....4:)The rest of the series isn't that scarry at all.The villian Randall Flagg sadly comes off a a slightly cheesy B-Movie type monster who's followers seem scarrier then himself.Now Ruby Dee's Abigal?Whole different situation.I was convinced until she actually appeared that she might in fact have been a angel.I think she was.Like Gary Sinise Ruby Dee seems a little beyond this.But as always she is highly convincing,even though....5:)The way in which the good/evil plot was presented might be a bit annoying (even slightly offensive) to non Christians.When Rob Lowes character Nick questions Mother Abigals constant chatter about god he is laughed at basically.This could all be Stephen Kings horror version of 'Touched By An Angel'?6:)The music in the movie makes sense until Corin Nemic starts blasting 'Boogie Fever' while he's building a shoe box bomb.""NO one gets between me and my disco"".Cheesy as velveeta but hilereous nontheless.7:)I like the character of Ralph.He had a big heart and all he did was end up being a human sacrifice in order to kill Randall Flagg and his followers.In my opinion you need alot of willfull,big hearted people to rebuild a world,not that....8:)Gary Sinise's Stu Redman wasn't lacking in heart but as the series goes on you notice how he is so tempted to make the mistakes that got humanity killed off.The implication seems to be that guns and violence solve every problem-is there REALLY a good and evil side.In the end Mother Abigals 'enchanted hand of god' enables an A-Bomb that destroys Flagg's heabquarters in Vegas.So are we talking about good guys or bad guys?9:)The character Nadine got on my nerves.She was a weak,spineless disgrace to femininity and why she deserved not to die with everyone else of the flu is beyond me.10:)I guess the good part is that 'The Stand' shows if humanity really pulls together in a crisis they can get things accomplished.The trouble comes at the way these accomplishments are carried out.NAW!Some of the 'good' survivors are clearly Jewish and athiast and I'm sure don't really get into Abigals highly Christian ideals.Okay so except for Nadine who should've died before the end of part one that's all subjective nit picking:just my opinion.That and of course the ending.The ending is so cutesy and oozy it's almost gag inducing.I'm not saying someone else should've died but it ended on the clished 'Adam & Eve' IE Gary Sinise/Molly Ringwald note.I would've like to see the end revolved around a newer (and more humanitarian) governing system coming into place.Better drama.It's obvious after watching the first part that it was US militarism and blind hysteria that was largely humanity's demise.And it does present an important social message to everyone-in times of a crisis,even the all too realistic epedemic presented here and people should think a bit before blindly following a leader because if we keep bumbling blindly forward and forget who we really are we could all be facing a very real 'Stand'.",4,Almost Fully Likeable,1133222400,"11 29, 2005",2005,4555,"['made', 'TV', 'miniseries', 'Stand', 'ranks', 'higher',

How many will it take before someone notices it's just not working? King mini-series alumni Mick Garris is back and, big surprise, worse than ever. You would think at least one person would have denied allowing him to destroy another King novel, but no, we are forced to see yet another dumpster-fire of a movie. So much talent (from the novel, of course) wasted on Garris' unimaginative, uninspired, unthinking style, and I use the term ""style"" VERY loosely. The direction looks like what you would get if you gave a degenerate ten year-old a handheld camcorder and let him go to work.Then, there's the acting...if you really consider it that much. Even rather good actors and actresses lacked substance, some of which can be chalked up to infantile Garris direction, but only some. Casting was a joke; nearly none of the actors truly fit the roles they were playing, and quite a few were completely absurd. Corin Nemec has to be the worst possible choice to play Harold Lauder, who in the novel was an overweight young man with acne, not a skinny goofball with less acting talent than Mariah Carey. Even Gary Sinese wasn't all that convincing, though he could have been with better direction. I shouldn't have to mention Jamey Sheridan was FAR from a convincing Flagg. King's teleplay was okay, considering there was some serious cheese due to the fact it's a tv mini-series. This novel was never meant to be so censored, so the dialog, action, ect. are often rather corny and irritating. So many allegorical elements were cut so this could be shown on network television it really hurts the overall story greatly. There is much more I could go on about but it all boils down to one simple fact: A 1,100 page novel with subject matter such as The Stand has will NEVER be able to be accurately and worthily adapted to film if said film is a made-for-tv movie-of-the-week.",2,"Read the book, Skip the movie",1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,1959,"['Ah', 'yet', 'disastrous', 'made-for-TV', 'adaptation', 'incredible', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'How', 'many', 'will', 'take', 'someone', 'just', 'not', 'working', 'King', 'mini-series', 'alumni', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'back', 'big', 'surprise', 'worse', 'ever', 'would', 'think', 'least', 'one', 'person', 'would', 'have', 'denied', 'allowing', 'destroy', 'King', 'novel', 'are', 'forced', 'see', 'yet', 'dumpster-fire', 'movie', 'So', 'much', 'talent', 'novel', 'course', 'wasted', 'Garris', 'unimaginative', 'uninspired', 'unthinking', 'style', 'use', 'term', 'style', 'VERY', 'loosely', 'direction', 'what', 'would', 'get', 'gave', 'degenerate', 'ten', 'year-old', 'handheld', 'camcorder', 'let', 'go', 'work.Then', 'acting', 'really', 'consider', 'much', 'Even', 'rather', 'good', 'actors', 'actresses', 'lacked', 'substance', 'can', 'be', 'chalked', 'up', 'infantile', 'Garris', 'direction', 'only', 'Casting', 'was', 'joke', 'nearly', 'none', 'actors', 'truly', 'fit', 'roles', 'were', 'playing', 'quite', 'few', 'were', 'completely', 'absurd', 'Corin', 'Nemec', 'be', 'worst', 'possible', 'choice', 'play', 'Harold', 'Lauder', 'who', 'novel', 'was', 'overweight', 'young', 'man', 'acne', 'not', 'skinny', 'goofball', 'less', 'acting', 'talent', 'Mariah', 'Carey', 'Even', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'was', ""n't"", 'convincing', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'direction', 'should', ""n't"", 'have', 'mention', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'was', 'FAR', 'convincing', 'Flagg', 'King', 'teleplay', 'was', 'okay', 'considering', 'was', 'serious', 'cheese', 'due', 'fact', 'tv', 'mini-series', 'novel', 'was', 'never', 'meant', 'be', 'so', 'censored', 'dialog', 'action', 'ect', 'are', 'often', 'rather', 'corny', 'irritating', 'So', 'many', 'allegorical', 'elements', 'were', 'cut', 'so', 'could', 'be', 'shown', 'network', 'television', 'really', 'overall', 'story', 'greatly', 'much', 'more', 'could', 'go', 'about', 'down', 'one', 'simple', 'fact', '1,100', 'page', 'novel', 'subject', 'matter', 'such', 'Stand', 'will', 'NEVER', 'be', 'able', 'be', 'accurately', 'worthily', 'adapted', 'film', 'said', 'film', 'made-for-tv', 'movie-of-the-week']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

360703,A2582KMXLK2P06,6303153461,B. E Jackson,"[0, 0]","The Stand is quite possibly the craziest Stephen King film ever created.  I say ""crazy"" because the storyline takes a *bunch* of different twists and turns, and the amount of characters the storyline introduces is staggering as well.You really need to give 100% attention in order to pay attention to a story like this.I've actually waited over 10 years to get the opportunity to watch the Stand once again.  I watched it when it was first released, but I was young back in the mid 90's and couldn't understand (or remain interested in) a storyline of this magnitude.Well, today I completely fried my brain and watched the ENTIRE movie in one sitting.  I'm exhausted!The reason I became interested in the Stand in the first place is because of the way the story jumps around to several completely different locations across the United States.  You have the peaceful green lands of Maine, the dry colorless deserts of Utah, the ghost towns of Texas, the mean streets of New York, and several other areas.  Back in the mid 90's I was completely obsessed with geography and couldn't get enough of it.I'm still amazed how the storyline takes us across several different areas of the United States, but now that I'm older I can actually understand the storyline as well.  Now I have the mature attention span to absorb all the events taking place.The first part of the story deals with a devastating virus that spreads across the USA and infects millions of people.Of course you've seen films like this before, so you know what happens when a virus outbreak occurs- the army and the government drive by in their trucks and army tanks, take everybody from their homes, and move them to a safe area.  The infected people are put in protected rooms in some laboratory or hospital.  Nothing new here.However, Stephen King is a genius (as you probably know) and would NEVER settle for something so ordinary (that I've seen anyway- I don't read his books; just watch the movies).  So the storyline quickly morphs into something else entirely.The focus on the virus outbreak quickly goes away as the storyline shifts to an evil presence being responsible for the outbreak, as well as mainly focusing on the nature of all the main characters in the film having unusual, frequent recurring dreams about an old woman who lives near a cornfield.From here, the REAL storyline takes place, and the question will be ""Throughout all these elaborate turn of events, who will live and who will die?"" as well as ""Who will continue to remain good with good intentions, and who will jump to the dark side and betray their little gathering of people?""The only problem with the film is that the third part (of the four) is easily the weakest, as the focus here is mainly on all the characters choosing to stick together and create this committee gathering of some sorts.  These segments last a bit too long for my liking.  They actually last about an hour too long.Other than that, the rest of the storyline is golden.  I love this movie.Of course some of the special effects are VERY dated by todays standards.

360706,AK7CAW3N1XZV6,6303153461,"Beth Cholette ""doctor_beth""","[89, 94]","From the moment I first sat down to watch this miniseries in 1994 and heard the first few opening bars of &quot;Don't Fear the Reaper,&quot; I have loved this movie.  I have read every one of Stephen King's books and have seen most of the movies adapted from these books.  Some of the adaptations have been awful, others good, and a few, such as The Shawshank Redemption, truly great; The Stand definitely belongs in this elite latter category.  I have heard that some fans of King's novel were disappointed in this miniseries, but to me, what's not to like?What really makes this movie work is the exceptional--and at times unconventional--casting.  The Stand was my first exposure to Gary Sinise, and I immediately fell in love with his perfect portrayal of Stu.  One of my teen idols, Rob Lowe, did an absolute amazing job with the role of Nick, proving that he had true range as an actor long before The West Wing came along.  I don't know why Adam Storke has not had more career success, as his personification of Larry Underwood was flawless.  And the supporting cast was nothing short of stellar:  terrific veteran actor Ray Walston as Glen Bateman, Bill Fagerbakke's sensitive portrayal of Tom Cullen, and Miguel Ferrar's perfectly desperate and despicable Lloyd Henried.  Although I would not have pictured Jamey Sheridan as Flagg, he definitely brought the character to life, striking a deft balance between Flagg's evil and humorous sides.  The one woefully miscast role was Molly Ringwald's Frannie--I don't think she was what King or anyone else had in mind for this character.  However, given that most of Ringwald's scenes are with Gary Sinise, this flaw is easily overlooked.Fans of the novel will definitely notice some changes to the plot, but these modifications were obviously necessary to keep this epic story to just under 6 hours.  However, the feel and flavor of the work remain unaltered, as the purity of King's classic good versus evil tale clearly shines through.  Finally, the haunting musical score serves to heighten the emotion of this captivating film.  I have enjoyed repeated viewings of this miniseries over the years, and it has remained one of my all-time favorite movies.",5,Amazing adaptation of Stephen King's apocalyptic novel,1084492800,"05 14, 2004",2004,2210,"['moment', 'first', 'sat', 'down', 'watch', 'miniseries', '1994', 'heard', 'first', 'few', 'opening', 'bars', 'quot', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Fear', 'Reaper', 'quot', 'have', 'loved', 'movie', 'have', 'read', 'one', 'Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'have', 'seen', 'most', 'movies', 'adapted', 'books', 'adaptations', 'have', 'been', 'awful', 'others', 'good', 'few', 'such', 'Shawshank', 'Redemption', 'truly', 'great', 'Stand', 'definitely', 'elite', 'latter', 'category', 'have', 'heard', 'fans', 'King', 'novel', 'were', 'disappointed', 'miniseries', 'what', 'not', 'like', 'What', 'really', 'movie', 'work', 'exceptional', 'times', 'unconventional', 'casting', 'Stand', 'was', 'first', 'exposure', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'immediately', 'fell', 'love', 'perfect', 'portrayal', 'Stu', 'One', 'teen', 'idols', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'did', 'absolute', 'amazing', 'job', 'role', 'Nick', 'proving', 'had', 'true', 'range', 'actor', 'long', 'West', 'Wing', 'came', 'along', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'why', 'Adam', 'Storke', 'not', 'had', 'more', 'career', 'success', 'personification', 'Larry', 'Underwood', 'was', 'flawless', 'supporting', 'cast', 'was', 'nothing', 'short', 'stellar', 'terrific', 'veteran', 'actor', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Glen', 'Bateman', 'Bill', 'Fagerbakke', 'sensitive', 'portrayal', 'Tom', 'Cullen', 'Miguel', 'Ferrar', 'perfectly', 'desperate', 'despicable', 'Lloyd', 'Henried', 'would', 'not', 'have', 'pictured', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'Flagg', 'definitely', 'brought', 'character', 'life', 'striking', 'deft', 'balance', 'Flagg', 'evil', 'humorous', 'sides', 'one', 'woefully', 'miscast', 'role', 'was', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Frannie', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'was', 'what', 'King', 'anyone', 'else', 'had', 'mind', 'character', 'However', 'given', 'most', 'Ringwald', 'scenes', 'are', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'flaw', 'easily', 'overlooked.Fans', 'novel', 'will', 'definitely', 'notice', 'changes', 'plot', 'modifications', 'were', 'obviously', 'necessary', 'keep', 'epic', 'story', 'just', '6', 'hours', 'However', 'feel', 'flavor', 'work', 'remain', 'unaltered', 'purity', 'King', 'classic', 'good', 'versus', 'evil', 'tale', 'clearly', 'Finally', 'haunting', 'musical', 'score', 'serves', 'heighten', 'emotion', 'captivating', 'film', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'repeated', 'viewings', 'miniseries', 'years', 'remained', 'one', 'all-time', 'favorite', 'movies']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS
360707,A417ZAKGXT9IN,6303153461,Betty June Moore,"[11, 13]","Okay, I'll admit it: I'm not much of a Stephen King fan. Horror has never been one of my favorite genres; you might say I even go out of my way to avoid it. Nevertheless, I've not only just started reading King's ""The Eyes of the Dragon,"" but I also recently watched Artisan Home Entertainment's 2-DVD set of ""Stephen King's The Stand.""I haven't read either edition of the novel (yes, there are two versions: a slightly truncated 1978 edition and a 1990 ""Uncut and Unabridged"" re-release), nor had I seen the ABC miniseries when it aired 10 years ago, so I had no idea what to expect. But when my boyfriend purchased this after we watched ""The Return of the King"" at the movies, I knew I had two choices. Either I could sit in front of my computer playing ""Star Wars Monopoly"" or sit next to him and watch the first two parts of the four-part miniseries. Even though the idea of sitting in front of my PC and buying Star Wars real estate seemed mighty appealing, I opted to watch at least part of ""The Stand"".To my surprise, I found myself enjoying the first episode, ""The Plague,"" during which a genetically engineered strain of influenza escapes from an Army lab and first kills most of the technicians, lab workers, and soldiers inside the Project Blue facility, then is unleashed upon an unsuspecting nation when a guard panics and spreads the virus when he attempts to flee with his wife and daughter. Within weeks, 99 percent of the world population is dead from the disease nicknamed ""Captain Trips.""Now, in most stories this would be pretty much it; I mean, where can you go when you have killed off most of humanity? King's answer is that the end of the world is only the start of the story. Most of the novel, if I interpret the miniseries correctly, deals with the remaining one percent that is somehow left untouched by ""Captain Trips."" What is left of humanity divides itself into two opposing camps.On one side, there are those who follow the Light side as personified by 106-year-old Mother Abigail (Ruby Dee) who lives on a small Nebraska farm. Through dreams, she gathers to her side Stu Redman (Gary Sinise), Larry Underwood (Adam Storke), Fran Goldsmith (Molly Ringwald), Glen Bateman (Ray Walston), Judge Farris (Ossie Davis), Tom Cullen (Bill Fagerbakke), and the deaf-mute Nick Andros (Rob Lowe). Guided, Mother Abigail says, by God, she leads this brave band to Boulder, Colorado, where they start trying to rebuild American society from scratch.But where there is Light, there is Darkness. In this case, its human-like face is that of the demonic Randall Flagg ( Jamey Sheridan of Law & Order: Criminal Intent) who can change his form at will and yet exudes a certain charisma that attracts many followers, including Lloyd Henreid (Miguel Ferrer), the insane firebug Trashcan Man (Matt Frewer), the nasty and mean Julie Lawry (Shawnee Smith), a character I found totally repulsive (she tries to seduce Nick in a small town in Oklahoma, then she torments the mildly retarded Tom when Nick rejects her advances). This rotten bunch sets up shop in ""Sin City"" itself, Las Vegas, and under Flagg's leadership, promptly begins planning the demise of the Boulder Free Zone. This, of course, means that conflict is inevitable, and this time it is for keeps.Even though King had to compress some of his huge novel to fit ABC's alloted time slot, and some characters are composites, The Stand is a well-written adaptation of a HUGE novel. Director Mick Garris keeps the story moving at a steady and nail biting pace. Even though there are a few spots where I wanted to go ""Ewwwwwww!"" the fact that the miniseries was made for broadcast television keeps the ""Yuck!"" factor to a minimum without lessening the power of the original horror classic's storyline.As I said earlier, I am not as fond of King or his style of stories as my boyfriend is, yet not only did I watch the first episode, but I also sat through the entire 366 minute running time over two nights. I found it was enteraining, scary at times, and even thought-provoking. At least as far as the genetically engineered flu virus, it might leave you wondering ""Could THIS really happen?""",5,"The world ends not with a bang, but with a sniffle.....",1074038400,"01 14, 2004",2004,4162,"['Okay', ""'ll"", 'admit', ""'m"", 'not', 'much', 'Stephen', 'King', 'fan', 'Horror', 'never', 'been', 'one', 'favorite', 'genres', 'might', 'say', 'even', 'go', 'way', 'avoid', 'Nevertheless', ""'ve"", 'not', 'only', 'just', 'started', 'reading', 'King', 'Eyes', 'Dragon', 'also', 'recently', 'watched', 'Artisan', 'Home', 'Entertainment', '2-DVD', 'set', 'Stephen', 'King', 'Stand', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'edition', 'novel', 'yes', 'are', 'two', 'versions', 'slightly', 'truncated', '1978', 'edition', '1990', 'Uncut', 'Unabridged', 're-release', 'had', 'seen', 'ABC', 'miniseries', 'when', 'aired', '10', 'years', 'ago', 'had', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'when', 'boyfriend', 'purchased', 'watched', 'Return', 'King', 'movies', 'knew', 'had', 'two', 'choices', 'could', 'sit', 'front', 'computer', 'playing', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Monopoly', 'sit', 'next', 'watch', 'first', 'two', 'parts', 'four-part', 'miniseries', 'Even', 'idea', 'sitting', 'front', 'PC', 'buying', 'Star', 'Wars', 'real', 'estate', 'seemed', 'mighty', 'appealing', 'opted', 'watch', 'least', 'part', 'Stand', '.To', 'surprise', 'found', 'enjoying', 'first', 'episode', 'Plague', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'strain', 'influenza', 'escapes', 'Army', 'lab', 'first', 'kills', 'most', 'technicians', 'lab', 'workers', 'soldiers', 'Project', 'Blue', 'facility', 'then', 'unleashed', 'unsuspecting', 'nation', 'when', 'guard', 'panics', 'virus', 'when', 'flee', 'wife', 'daughter', 'Within', 'weeks', '99', 'percent', 'world', 'population', 'dead', 'disease', 'nicknamed', 'Captain', 'Trips', 'Now', 'most', 'stories', 'would', 'be', 'pretty', 'much', 'mean', 'where', 'can', 'go', 'when', 'have', 'killed', 'off', 'most', 'humanity', 'King', 'answer', 'end', 'world', 'only', 'start', 'story', 'Most', 'novel', 'interpret', 'miniseries', 'correctly', 'deals', 'remaining', 'one', 'percent', 'somehow', 'left', 'untouched', 'Captain', 'Trips', 'What', 'left', 'humanity', 'divides', 'two', 'opposing', 'camps.On', 'one', 'side', 'are', 'who', 'follow', 'Light', 'side', 'personified', '106-year-old', 'Mother', 'Abigail', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'who', 'small', 'Nebraska', 'farm', 'dreams', 'side', 'Stu', 'Redman', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Larry', 'Underwood', 'Adam', 'Storke', 'Fran', 'Goldsmith', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Glen', 'Bateman', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Judge', 'Farris', 'Ossie', 'Davis', 'Tom', 'Cullen', 'Bill', 'Fagerbakke', 'deaf-mute', 'Nick', 'Andros', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Guided', 'Mother', 'Abigail', 'God', 'brave', 'band', 'Boulder', 'Colorado', 'where', 'start', 'trying', 'rebuild', 'American', 'society', 'scratch.But', 'where', 'Light', 'Darkness', 'case', 'human-like', 'face', 'demonic', 'Randall', 'Flagg', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'Law', 'Order', 'Criminal', 'Intent', 'who', 'can', 'change', 'form', 'will', 'yet', 'certain', 'charisma', 'many', 'followers', 'including', 'Lloyd', 'Henreid', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'insane', 'firebug', 'Trashcan', 'Man', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'nasty', 'mean', 'Julie', 'Lawry', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'character', 'found', 'totally', 'repulsive', 'seduce', 'Nick', 'small', 'town', 'Oklahoma', 'then', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'Tom', 'when', 'Nick', 'advances', 'rotten', 'bunch', 'up', 'shop', 'Sin', 'City', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'Flagg', 'leadership', 'promptly', 'planning', 'demise', 'Boulder', 'Free', 'Zone', 'course', 'conflict', 'inevitable', 'time', 'keeps.Even', 'King', 'had', 'compress', 'huge', 'novel', 'fit', 'ABC', 'alloted', 'time', 'slot', 'characters', 'are', 'composites', 'Stand', 'well-written', 'adaptation', 'HUGE', 'novel', 'Director', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'story', 'moving', 'steady', 'nail', 'biting', 'pace', 'Even', 'are', 'few', 'spots', 'where', 'wanted', 'go', 'Ewwwwwww', 'fact', 'miniseries', 'was', 'made', 'broadcast', 'television', 'Yuck', 'factor', 'minimum', 'lessening', 'power', 'original', 'horror', 'classic', 'storyline.As', 'said', 'earlier', 'am', 'not', 'fond', 'King', 'style', 'stories', 'boyfriend', 'yet', 'not', 'only', 'did', 'watch', 'first', 'episode', 'also', 'sat', 'entire', '366', 'minute', 'running', 'time', 'two', 'nights', 'found', 'was', 'enteraining', 'scary', 'times', 'even', 'thought-provoking', 'least', 'as', 'far', 'genetically', 'engineered', 'flu', 'virus', 'might', 'leave', 'wondering', 'Could', 'THIS', 'really', 'happen']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

In this case, the producers worked very hard to give the viewing audience the distilled, essentials of the book and its characters.The cast of actor in the mini-series is first rate, especially Adam Storke's version of Larry Underwood.The mini-series has too much of a made-for-TV feel, the special effects seem to be garage level-something like the first season of Star Trek the Next Generation.  The sets, though are pretty good.  Especially excellent is the portrayal of the Mid-West summer as the characters head towards Nebraska.Stephen King's books and stories suffer from only one flaw- his Weltanschauung is that of a small town New England Yankee circa 1972.  His view of the Government, the military, and the like seem to be biological warfare, atom bombs, and cover-ups.  In his stories, there is always something a bit ""off"" about his descriptions of the people and places in the parts of the United States outside the North East.  Despite this, the use of The Strip in Las Vegas for the final stand between good and evil is well put, for the lights, bling, gambling, speculation and leisurely pursuits of Vegas have a sense of decay that that resonates outside Maine.",4,The Stand-A Not Too Bad Mini Series,1365379200,"04 8, 2013",2013,1260,"['Stand', 'mini-series', 'version', 'Stephen', 'King', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'case', 'producers', 'worked', 'very', 'hard', 'give', 'viewing', 'audience', 'distilled', 'essentials', 'book', 'characters.The', 'cast', 'actor', 'mini-series', 'first', 'rate', 'especially', 'Adam', 'Storke', 'version', 'Larry', 'Underwood.The', 'mini-series', 'too', 'much', 'made-for-TV', 'feel', 'special', 'effects', 'seem', 'be', 'garage', 'level-something', 'first', 'season', 'Star', 'Trek', 'Next', 'Generation', 'sets', 'are', 'pretty', 'good', 'Especially', 'excellent', 'portrayal', 'Mid-West', 'summer', 'characters', 'head', 'towards', 'Nebraska.Stephen', 'King', 'books', 'stories', 'suffer', 'only', 'one', 'flaw-', 'Weltanschauung', 'small', 'town', 'New', 'England', 'Yankee', 'circa', '1972', 'view', 'Government', 'military', 'like', 'seem', 'be', 'biological', 'warfare', 'atom', 'bombs', 'cover-ups', 'stories', 'always', 'something', 'bit', 'descriptions', 'people', 'places', 'parts', 'United', 'States', 'North', 'East', 'use', 'Strip', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'final', 'stand', 'good', 'evil', 'well', 'put', 'lights', 'bling', 'gambling', 'speculation', 'leisurely', 'pursuits', 'Vegas', 'have', 'sense', 'decay', 'outside', 'Maine']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

I watched the movie in one whole night and I did not get to bed until four in the morning. Let me tell you all that it was worth staying up that late to watch this six-hour masterpiece that was adapted from one of Stephen King's best tales of horror.After a a lab of scientists create a secretly experiment involving some sort of deadly superflu, all hell breaks loose when the deadly chemichal flu leaks out and destroys 80-85% of America, the lone survivors must meet up together and try to save America from a being is referred to as The Dark Man.

Not only do they dream about the sweet old woman, they dream about The Dark Man, whose real name is Randall Flagg. Randall is all evil in its purest form, for he is the Devil himself. Will everyone one die at Flagg's evil wrath? Or will they take THE STAND and send him howling back to the gates of Hell?

The premise is good and it starts out well with the disease wiping out 99% of mankind. I can stand the low budget effects (it was 1994 after all) and cheesy dialog. But once the characters started coming together, it becomes confusing. There are many scenes that just don't fit anywhere. Almost none of the characters are developed at all. As example, between parts 2 and 3, you end with a convoy approaching one refugee group in Colorado, and the next scene in part 3, another refugee group is performing surgery! The scene is completely out of the blue, we have no idea who the victim is or how the main character obtained any skills to remove an appendix. In the next scene, two characters are making out and she's pregnant with his baby. They just met 10 minutes ago! It gives you the date at the bottom of the screen periodically - there is no way she would even know if she was pregnant yet. No one gave any thought to continuity in this piece. In another scene, they send spies to the evil city. A guy on a BICYCLE heads on the 800 mile trip, and in the next scene he is there working construction. The other spy who took a TRUCK gets killed halfway over an hour in the movie later. The third just suddenly appears there as the bad guy's mistress. So then the 4 characters decide to go to the evil city, on FOOT! But then when they get there, nothing mattered because a ghostly hand of GOD blows all the bad guys up. They could have just sat around BBQing for the entire movie. Worst ending ever. Then, the main character gets back to town and his baby has been born - and according to the date, 7 months premature apparently!This whole movie is long, boring, pointless, and stupid.

I was impressed with some things that were done, unimpressed with other's, and mystified by other choices.first of all...impressives:  I wish I could remember the actor's name, but whoever played Larry Underwood.  WOW!  Same for Ray Walston, Gary Sinise, Miguel Ferrera, and Ruby Dee.  Just terrific performances in key roles that truly grounded the performance.  Also, keeping the Las Vegas setting was terrific.  Not sure if they had to recreate downtown Vegas on a theater lot or actually managed to clear it out, but either way, got it perfect and it was necessary to keep essential story elements in place.  Jamey Sheridan as Randall Flagg also manages to delightfully chew up every scene he's in.Unimpressed...Casting Rob Lowe as the Deaf-mute Nick Andros.  Wha?  OK...after the novelty of Rob Lowe not uttering any words wears off (About 5 minutes into his performance), it's as if he's just there to look pretty.  Combining the Characters of Rita and Nadine was unwise as well.  While Laura San giancomo does a good job with Nadine, Eliminating the character of Rita, who in my view is central in Larry Underwood's transition from Rock Demigogue to savior of humanity, was a poor choice of scripting.As for SO WRONG...JUST SO VERY WRONG, casting Molly Ringwald as the central character Frannie?  Wha?  Frannie is a woman of unplumbed strength and resolve, and I would assume, some earty sexiness.  Molly Ringwald?  She really doesn't convey much of anything outside of bemused resignation.  Granted, she doesn't do an awful job with the part, but it's such a significant role that I felt it would have been better represented by like, Mary Stuart Masterson or even Mary Louise Parker.But, that casting glitch aside, I can recommend this DVD, beause it's such a captivating story, and is quite worthy of repeated viewings.",3,"Great King adaptation, great casting, with ONE exception...",1094083200,"09 2, 2004",2004,1958,"['had', 'read', 'Stand', 'several', 'years', 'ago', 'was', 'throughly', 'excited', 'when', 'heard', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'adapted', 'small', 'screen', 'was', 'impressed', 'things', 'were', 'done', 'unimpressed', 'other', 'mystified', 'other', 'choices.first', 'impressives', 'wish', 'could', 'remember', 'actor', 'name', 'whoever', 'played', 'Larry', 'Underwood', 'WOW', 'Same', 'Ray', 'Walston', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'Miguel', 'Ferrera', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'Just', 'terrific', 'performances', 'key', 'roles', 'truly', 'grounded', 'performance', 'Also', 'keeping', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'setting', 'was', 'terrific', 'Not', 'sure', 'had', 'recreate', 'downtown', 'Vegas', 'theater', 'lot', 'actually', 'managed', 'clear', 'out', 'way', 'got', 'perfect', 'was', 'necessary', 'keep', 'essential', 'story', 'elements', 'place', 'Jamey', 'Sheridan', 'Randall', 'Flagg', 'also', 'delightfully', 'chew', 'up', 'scene', 'in.Unimpressed', 'Casting', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'Deaf-mute', 'Nick', 'Andros', 'Wha', 'OK', 'novelty', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'not', 'uttering', 'words', 'wears', '5', 'minutes', 'performance', 'just', 'there', 'look', 'pretty', 'Combining', 'Characters', 'Rita', 'Nadine', 'was', 'unwise', 'as', 'well', 'Laura', 'San', 'giancomo', 'good', 'job', 'Nadine', 'Eliminating', 'character', 'Rita', 'who', 'view', 'central', 'Larry', 'Underwood', 'transition', 'Rock', 'Demigogue', 'savior', 'humanity', 'was', 'poor', 'choice', 'scripting.As', 'SO', 'WRONG', 'JUST', 'SO', 'VERY', 'WRONG', 'casting', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'central', 'character', 'Frannie', 'Wha', 'Frannie', 'woman', 'unplumbed', 'strength', 'resolve', 'would', 'assume', 'earty', 'sexiness', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'really', ""n't"", 'convey', 'much', 'anything', 'bemused', 'resignation', 'Granted', ""n't"", 'do', 'awful', 'job', 'part', 'such', 'significant', 'role', 'felt', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'represented', 'Mary', 'Stuart', 'Masterson', 'even', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Parker.But', 'casting', 'glitch', 'aside', 'can', 'recommend', 'DVD', 'such', 'captivating', 'story', 'quite', 'worthy', 'repeated', 'viewings']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

360724,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,6303153461,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[4, 4]","Stephen King fanatics such as myself waited a long time to see a cinematic version of Stephen King's The Stand, the apocalyptic epic which many fans then and now consider King's masterpiece (although The Dark Tower series may have passed it in terms of importance to King's legacy).  Personally, I consider the novel It to be King's magnum opus, but The Stand naturally means a lot to me.  One wondered if a film version could ever be made that could do the original novel justice; certainly, King himself would not proceed with such a project until such time as he felt he could pull it off.  This six-hour miniseries is fantastic, due largely to King's hands-on overseeing of what can be called ""his baby.""  This was a massive undertaking, and it yielded a final product just about as good as it could possibly be.  The obvious truth is, though, that even this monumental film pales in comparison to the novel.  While the onset of the superflu and its horrifying effects is told extremely well and in great detail, other parts of the story are glossed over to some degree, particularly the activities in the Free Boulder Zone; more importantly, there simply isn't enough time to flesh out all of the important characters, and it is this unfortunate yet essentially unavoidable quandary that somewhat diminishes a fan's enjoyment of the story.By and large, the casting is excellent.  Gary Sinise is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood, and he essentially becomes Stu Redman in this production.  Jamey Sheridan is more than acceptable as Randall Flagg, Ray Walston is brilliant as Glen Bateman, Rob Lowe gives a powerful performance as deaf-mute Nick Andros, and Bill Fagerbakke oftentimes steals the show as the mentally challenged Tom Cullen.  Molly Ringwald is good, but she just didn't become the Frannie Goldsmith I had long ago created in my mind, her character becoming rather aggravating to me in the later segments of the production.  Laura San Giacomo really brought Nadine Cross to life, and the raw yet tapped sexual energy she brought to the role makes me think she could have tempted me over to the dark side without a heck of a lot of trouble.  Matt Frewer simply is Trash Can Man; it's just a pity that his character was not explored to the much more significant degree found in the novel.  The one character I have a problem with is that of Harold Lauder; Corin Nemec overdoes things a little early on, but the real problem is with the character more than the actor.  It's not simply a matter of Nemec not really looking like Lauder; the problem is that Nemec's character is thoroughly unlikable from the very start, whereas the Harold Lauder of the novel is someone I sympathized with to a significant degree (at least up until his little surprise parting gift to Boulder).  Of course, no discussion of the actors and actresses assembled here is complete without a chorus of praises sent Ruby Dee's way for her remarkable portrayal of 106-year-old Mother Abigail Freemantle.  I was shocked to learn that Ruby Dee was actually a vibrant, far from elderly woman.  One must also mention Stephen King's fine acting performance here, as he puts in much more than just a brief cameo appearance.The Stand does have some weaknesses in terms of the special effects, notwithstanding the amazing makeup job on Ruby Dee.  While the explosions and decayed bodies are brought off quite well, the transformation of Flagg's face between human and demon leaves much to be desired, and some of the special effects at the climax of the film are not very impressive at all.  The way in which masses of dead bodies were displayed was quite effective, but I was a little bothered to see dead men and women hunched over buffet lines, poised in the seats of tractors in the field, etc.  ""Captain Trips"" was not some type of poison that killed you instantly; you suffered with the flu for some time before death came knocking, and I can't believe gravely sick people were doing some of the things they were purportedly doing when the end came.In the final analysis, Stephen King's The Stand is far from perfect, and watching the miniseries is by no means a substitute for reading the epic novel.  You don't get a chance to really know these characters inside and out over the course of a mere six hours, and those who have not read the novel may question why some characters were even there in the film.  Still, The Stand represents a monumental achievement in miniseries and film production, and I for one am thankful that a network allowed King as much time as it did in order to bring the pages of his novel to life.  On a final note, the special feature about the making of The Stand is quite disappointing, coming in at just over five minutes in length.  This disappointment is offset to some degree, however, by the inclusion of commentary provided by Stephen King, director Mick Garris, and several of the actors.",5,"As good as the movie is, it can't

360736,A280GY5UVUS2QH,6303153461,Doug Anderson,"[2, 2]","There are forces at work in the universe that defy rational understanding or explanation. Thats why Steven King novels are so popular.You probably already know the plot but here it goes: Superbad superflu is accidentally released (while BOC's ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" plays) and randomly kills all but a few hundred survivors who are immune to the superflu. The survivors come in two varieties: the good and pure souls played by likable folksy folk like a no-nonsense Gary Sinese, a deaf and dumb Rob Lowe, a flirty (but relatively innocent) daddy's girl Molly Ringwald, a wise old white guy Ray Walston, a wise old black guy Ossie Davis, and these pure souls all collectively dream of a front porch sittin' and guitar pluckin' witchy woman played by Ruby Dee who telepathically leads them to the promised land in Boulder, Colorado; and then there are the bad souls played by no-name actors who are led to Vegas by an old scratch who looks like a really bad and really coked-up eighties rock star (complete with tight jeans and mullet). The two tribes then go to war.The good are those communitarians who care about other people; the bad are the selfish who only care about themselves. Simple as that. But the really interesting thing here is that King doesn't have nature or some supernatural force sort things out for the survivors; rather the survivors have to sort things out for themselves and some of the survivors are not certain which master they serve and which town they belong in (a very sexy Laura San Giacomo plays one of these undecideds). Ruby Dee might have special powers but these powers come and go and though they have the ability to gather people together and inspire them they cannot be relied upon to make every decision. The people must empower themselves. This is a very nice touch on Kings part.King provides us with a great Andromeda Strain-style drama AND a clever piece of American social satire AND an interesting meditation on character,  religious prophecy/determinism, and free will all in one. If you don't like Steven King because he is not highbrow enough for you well its your loss because King is a crowd pleaser extraordinaire and these characters and this plot please at an exceptionally high level.I love the examination of various geographies and psychologies and psychogeographies. King is a master at portraying regional types without resorting to stereotypes; I guess you could say that he invents his own pantheon of American archetypes for each project and this pantheon of archetypes is one of his all-time best.  Plus his diagnosis of American ills c. 1980's is right on. Eighties excess never looked so deserving of ...exactly what it gets. This film is six hours of extremely satisfying characterizations and plotting. And it provides the perfect antithesis to the ""greed is good"" eighties.Only one flaw: The last hour is perhaps the weakest of the six but thats maybe because King isn't satisfied with the big comeuppance scene and tries to deliver a lesson about faith and sacrificing the one for the many that feels forced when everything else feels so natural and right. After five hours of excellent and inspired rock-fueled (I already mentioned BOC's ""Don't Fear the Reaper"" but Crowded House's ""Don't Dream Its Over"" is another song that is used to great effect) mini-series I think most people want a complication-free resolution.

Instead, Mick Garris took the bull by the horns and along with King, set out and made a TV mini series of sorts with it.  The film does follow the book fairly well although I did notice some inaccuracies but nobody is perfect.  The story is about a super flue virus that is accidentally unleashed after a failed quarantine at a military testing facility.  One man who is a guard on duty flees with his wife and baby, only to end up finding out that he had been infected before he left.  In 3 months 99% of the population of the Earth is dead, and what is left are two camps of survivors, one good and one not so good.  The bad guys are assembled by a spawn of hell, some sort of supernatural demonic power that takes on a human form as a long haired guy in a jacket and cowboy boots.  The man is called Randall Flag and he is played by Jamie Sheridan.  The good people have dreams of an elderly woman in Nebraska who summons them to follow her to Boulder, Colorado where they will all meet and eventually take on Flagg and his followers.  I am dismayed at the reviews that say the casting is bad, this cast is just great!  Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald and Rob Lowe just to name a few, and they are all fit for the role that they play in The Stand.  The scenes of an empty New York city are very sombering and the ideals of good vs. evil are shown exactly as they should be.  I think I liked Rob Lowe as Nick Andros the best, Lowe plays Nick who is a deaf mute and he is amazing in this movie.  If people liked the book it is a must see, and even if people did not read the book they still might like it anyways.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the sound quality is not great, not bad just could have been better.

In the back of my mind I always suspected that someone would make a movie of it one day. It was something I both hoped and dreaded at the same  time.Actually I was quite surpised at how this mini series turned out. I  can only describe it as hot and cold. The best part, like in the book, is  when the plague is killing everybody and the country is in chaos. At other  times (like in the book) the story lulls.This adaptation is obviously  based on the cut version of King's book. I thought that was a bit of a  pity. It might have been interesting to see an actor's interpretation as  &quot;The Kid&quot;. (One of my favorite parts in the book was when  Trashcan Man was travelling west with The Kid.)When I first read the  novel in 1992 I imagined Corin Nemec as Nick Andros. Two years later I saw  him cast as Harold Lauder. I found that very weird. In general the story  seemed a bit toned down from the novel. After the plague it felt more like  a Western than a horror story.It was a nice  touch to include Crowded  Houses' &quot;Don't Dream it's Over&quot; in the soundtrack. (A song by one  of my favourite groups.) Jamey Sheridan gave a good performance as the dark  man. He was an actor I had never seen before. After the dark man's defeat  the story slowed down again.Fortunately this adaptation hasn't spoiled  the personal picture I have in my mind when reading the novel.

I know the movie is 6 hours in length put it pulled me in after the first episode. It had a great apocalyptic opening where it can possibly happen in real life with the virus and all. The second half jumps into this supernatural realm where people dare not go and I find that fascinating. I got this movie from a 5 movie collection by Artisan (also had Cujo, Golden Years, The Langoliers, and Thinner) and I received the 2-disc version which is good but its probably better than the flipper disc. I despise flipper discs because they get scratched and broken so easily that its not funny. Lucky me I guess. This would be a great DVD title to come out on Blu-Ray. Imagine the entire 6-hour film on one disc with no flipping or changing. The Golden Years was an amazing disc to me since the 232 minute film was on a single, non-flipper disc. Go figure. Yeah it takes off a lot of room on your shelf, since the VHS version of The Stand was 4 tapes. The DVD is either one or two discs. DAMN! Overall this movie is a must-see and I strongly recommend that you get a comfy chair and caffeine pills to get through this film. I didn't though. I sat through the whole 6 hours with no problem. I think you all can too. This movie is screaming for a Blu-Ray release.

It starts out great, falls in the middle, and runs around in the last hour or so trying to fit everything together.The six hour movie does have some good actors and actresses, but Gary Sinise stands out above the rest. The plot takes you through many twists and turns, the first being any surivors of the plague, which we don't know if it ever reached other countries, although logic suggests that it did. It then takes you to a struggle between the forces of good and evil, ending badly for the evil people, but still leaving you like you've been cheated.

360751,AVO9QQWRRXESK,6303153461,Heather Hays,"[4, 5]","I read the book about two or three years ago and for the most part I was impressed with it. There were parts that I disliked, (the abrupt ending) but the fact that the book still had me thinking about it weeks after I stopped reading it says a lot for the awesome magnitude of King's skill.Like other reviewers have mentioned, Stephen King made all the cuts and even made a cameo in the mini-series. No one could have done it better. Watching it, I was impressed with how closely the movie stuck to the story. (Usually they botch things like this up and come out with a corny, ridiculous mess) if ""IT"" is any kind of example of this, and I think it is.But the series really left very little out. All the most important elements were there and parts of it were simply beautiful (for example, the showdown at the end and the first church meeting in the Freezone was so well done and realistic that it almost brought me to tears.) I think most of the people who watch this after reading the book will still be impressed.Moving on to the acting...Gary Sinise, as everyone else said, was amazing as Stu Redman. (I actually liked his portrayal of Stu more than I liked the original character from the story).Larry and Lloyd were my favorite characters from the book. At first I was iffy about Adam Storke's portrayal of Larry, but as the series progressed, I watched him become the character. By the end of the movie, in the showdown in Las Vegas, he was Larry, EXACTLY. He did amazing things with the character.Miguel Ferrer, as Lloyd also did some excellent work. Lloyd, as Flagg's right hand man, is kind of the wild card in the story. You can see it from both sides, and he's easy to relate to, even as a bad guy. He wasn't the Lloyd that I remembered from the book (I always saw Lloyd as being a younger, blond stoner type.) Miguel Ferrer gives us a different sort of Lloyd, but not an entirely bad one.By the end of the book, Frannie had become one of my least favorite characters, so I have nothing to say about Molly Ringwald's acting. As far as I'm concerned, no one's acting could have saved that character.There were a couple of small, notable roles that I thought were overlooked by most of the reviews I've read so far. The girl who played Dana was amazing and she completely stole the scene from Flagg as he hemmed and hawed in a Halloween mask, trying to scare her.The girl who played Lucy was good as well. I found it funny that she actually overshadowed the woman who played Nadine (Nadine was supposed to be drop dead gorgeous.)Another thing that impressed me was how much the depth the minor characters actually supplied. By doing nothing special, and acting like average Joes trying to get on with their lives, I was struck by the fact that this is probably exactly how people in this situation would behave.This movie didn't scare me at all. Flagg's devil masks looked stupid and fake and I laughed at them. Apparently the anti-christ robbed a novelty shop on his way out west and stocked up. The most disturbing part is the beginning, when everyone is dying. (Or maybe the very end.)",5,"As an ABC mini-series, it's really the best it can be",1120089600,"06 30, 2005",2005,3099,"['read', 'book', 'two', 'three', 'years', 'ago', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'impressed', 'were', 'parts', 'disliked', 'abrupt', 'ending', 'fact', 'book', 'still', 'had', 'thinking', 'weeks', 'stopped', 'reading', 'lot', 'awesome', 'magnitude', 'King', 'skill.Like', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'mentioned', 'Stephen', 'King', 'made', 'cuts', 'even', 'made', 'cameo', 'mini-series', 'one', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'better', 'Watching', 'was', 'impressed', 'how', 'closely', 'movie', 'stuck', 'story', 'Usually', 'botch', 'things', 'up', 'come', 'out', 'corny', 'ridiculous', 'mess', 'IT', 'kind', 'example', 'think', 'series', 'really', 'left', 'very', 'little', 'out', 'most', 'important', 'elements', 'were', 'there', 'parts', 'were', 'simply', 'beautiful', 'example', 'showdown', 'end', 'first', 'church', 'meeting', 'Freezone', 'was', 'so', 'well', 'done', 'realistic', 'almost', 'brought', 'tears', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'watch', 'reading', 'book', 'will', 'still', 'be', 'impressed.Moving', 'acting', 'Gary', 'Sinise', 'everyone', 'else', 'said', 'was', 'amazing', 'Stu', 'Redman', 'actually', 'liked', 'portrayal', 'Stu', 'more', 'liked', 'original', 'character', 'story', '.Larry', 'Lloyd', 'were', 'favorite', 'characters', 'book', 'first', 'was', 'iffy', 'Adam', 'Storke', 'portrayal', 'Larry', 'series', 'progressed', 'watched', 'become', 'character', 'end', 'movie', 'showdown', 'Las', 'Vegas', 'was', 'Larry', 'EXACTLY', 'did', 'amazing', 'things', 'character.Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'Lloyd', 'also', 'did', 'excellent', 'work', 'Lloyd', 'Flagg', 'right', 'hand', 'man', 'kind', 'wild', 'card', 'story', 'can', 'see', 'sides', 'easy', 'relate', 'even', 'bad', 'guy', 'was', ""n't"", 'Lloyd', 'remembered', 'book', 'always', 'saw', 'Lloyd', 'being', 'younger', 'blond', 'stoner', 'type', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'different', 'sort', 'Lloyd', 'not', 'entirely', 'bad', 'end', 'book', 'Frannie', 'had', 'become', 'one', 'least', 'favorite', 'characters', 'so', 'have', 'nothing', 'say', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', 'acting', 'As', 'far', ""'m"", 'concerned', 'one', 'acting', 'could', 'have', 'saved', 'were', 'couple', 'small', 'notable', 'roles', 'thought', 'were', 'overlooked', 'most', 'reviews', ""'ve"", 'read', 'so', 'far', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Dana', 'was', 'amazing', 'completely', 'stole', 'scene', 'Flagg', 'hemmed', 'hawed', 'Halloween', 'mask', 'trying', 'scare', 'her.The', 'girl', 'who', 'played', 'Lucy', 'was', 'good', 'as', 'well', 'found', 'actually', 'overshadowed', 'woman', 'who', 'played', 'Nadine', 'Nadine', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'drop', 'dead', 'gorgeous', 'thing', 'impressed', 'was', 'how', 'much', 'depth', 'minor', 'characters', 'actually', 'supplied', 'doing', 'nothing', 'special', 'acting', 'like', 'average', 'Joes', 'trying', 'get', 'lives', 'was', 'struck', 'fact', 'probably', 'exactly', 'how', 'people', 'situation', 'would', 'behave.This', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'scare', 'Flagg', 'devil', 'masks', 'looked', 'stupid', 'fake', 'laughed', 'Apparently', 'anti-christ', 'robbed', 'novelty', 'shop', 'way', 'west', 'stocked', 'up', 'most', 'disturbing', 'part', 'beginning', 'when', 'everyone', 'dying', 'maybe', 'very', 'end']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

It is the final catastrophy novel where the whole of humanity is destroyed by some  military research. This is secondary in the book or the video. What is  essential is the spectacle of the slow and precise decaying of our society  and the emergence of two possible futures.  One is positive and is inspired  by an old black woman. The other is negative and instilled in the minds of  some deranged men by the famous Dark Man, the famous Randall Flagg, the  famous etc.  On one side the good ones reinvent democracy and American  history. On the other side the bad ones reinvent a fascist society based on  torture and absolute tyranny.  What is interesting, first of all and above  all, in the book and the video is the concept of sacrifice. The good ones,  be they in the hands of God or of any other spiritual force, it does not  matter since if you don't believe in God, He believes in you, can only  impose their humane vision on the world, hence save humanity and not only  the human animal, by sending four of their foremost leaders to get  sacrificed (after three spies, which makes seven delegates) by the monster.  And it is in fact more witnesses than lambs that are sent. Two will be  sacrificed, one will be shot in prison, one will be shot on his way to Las  vegas, and one will kill herself not to speak. Only two will survive. One  because he broke his leg along the way and did not reach Las Vegas. The  other one because he managed to escape due to his retardness. The world  saved by this sacrifice and by the retarded individual that can escape any  scrutiny, even that of the devil.  Yet the video lacks something, it lacks  the virginal ending of the book, the return to some natural life, to a  natural couple with a child, to the Garden of Eden, and ends only on a  happy ending. Kind of a shame that King cut off that purely naive ending  that gave some new perspective to the story: we have to reinvent Eden if we  want humanity to survive, not only Boulder, that is to say a new Jerusalem,  some kind of ambiguous ending because of the echo it finds in some puritan  vision, at least of God and humanity as a whole.

360762,A1NF9WS7RR82MX,6303153461,J. Hill,"[0, 0]","The Stand movie gets mixed reviews because most people recognize that, while it has flaws in several departments, it also has some truly excellent material.  In a way, you could say that mirrors the novel itself; with so much plot, so many characters, so much to keep track of, not everything is going to be perfect.  Overall though, it's completely worth seeing, and nowadays, when you can't just rent an out-of-print movie from the local video store, you pretty much have to buy it to see it.  If you're a fan of King (which I'd assume anyone looking into buying The Stand DVD would be), you should probably have it.  If not, you'll live fine without it.As many point out, Gary Sinise's Stu Redman is worth the price of admission, and the performances given for Mother Abigail, Larry Underwood, Glen Bateman, and Tom Cullen stand out.  Miguel Ferrer also gives a strong performance as Lloyd Henreid despite the physical differences from the character in the book.  Obvious weaknesses are Molly Ringwald as Fran, Corin Nemic as Harold, and quite a few moments of poor acting.  On the so/so side, you generally get a mix of opinions on the portrayals of Randall Flagg, Trashcan Man, Nadine Cross, and Nick; all of which I find passable, but I'd love to see new versions.  And why the hell they thought Rob Lowe's face was too pretty to put an eyepatch over, I'll never figure out.Story-wise, it's mostly faithful to the original, with a few characters and some dialogue either cut or re-assigned.  The edits are due to time constraints, which were still necessary in order to film the massive script.  This movie is not perfect, and you will definitely have small moments when you nearly hate the decisions the director or actors have made, but since it's mostly satisfying and enjoyable, I give it a B-.

The movie depicts the onset of the flu and how quickly such a plague can get out of hand and kill everybody.The few survivors group together and Stu Redman (Gary Sinise) is one of the main characters who helps lead a group of them to Nebraska and then to Boulder Colorado to be with Mother Abigail Fremantle (Ruby Dee) who is gathering the righteous.  Trashcan Man (Matt Frewer) plays a key role in the story and does a wonderful job of playing the part of a simple minded arsonist who can't help himself but to always do the wrong thing.  He is a favorite of the movie's villain, Randall Flagg (Jamey Sheridan), who collects the worst of mankind and builds a community in Las Vegas.This is one of Stephen King's best books and also one of the best movies ever made from one of his novels.

(which included the tome's author, Stephen King) offers us a vapid TV visualization of ""The Stand"", diminishing all impact which imagination initially lent this powerful epic; driving onto the wastelands of a dead earth, seeing an unseeable being (Flagg) in our mind's eye, envisioning the disturbing horrors of the Lincoln Tunnel gridlock, the appendix operation, the suicides and rapes and mean killings.In TV Land, we're stuck with an intelligent A-Lister working his laconic Mini-Eastwood Method (Gary Sinise), aided by a clutch of talent-challenged second-stringers, aspirin-ad veterans and phone-in cameos. And the Bad Guy - the incarnation of hell-on-earth whose visage people could not cast their gaze upon: a country singer with a mullet!If Jeff Goldblum (as rumored) had accepted the role of Flagg, we might have had a respectable screen-demon on our hands - instead, we meet the Dark Man of all our nightmares as a toe-tappin' redneck with a Def-Leppard-roadie hairdo. The only thing more sinful than his Huey Lewis mullet-palooza was his 80's fashion sense.A super-flu has wiped out the bulk of humanity and two camps (one Good, one Eeevil) amass devotees to stage a Final Battle. The Good camp leans heavily on the delusional proselytizing of their matriarch, Mother Abigail, no one noticing that the ""epic"" quest that she entreats four characters to undertake ""to make a stand"" achieves nothing that wasn't going to transpire anyway. The Eeevil Flagg's downfall was precipitated by inefficient management and insubordination, not the half-assed jibes of Our Heroes, who very rightfully got crucified for their troubles... Trusting to the wigged-out soothsaying of a raving old woman hallucinating from her mixture of Demerol, Cyclizine and down-home moonshine and traveling to The Dark Man's lair with no plan, no resources, nothing but ""the shirts on their backs"" was bound to lead to the business end of a crucifix.Even in the book, simply laughing in the face of the Bad Guy in order to cause empire-crumbling dissension was an obtuse disconnect; a tale so wonderfully kinetic and operatic - brick-walled when one realizes that the author himself had no clear notion on how to wrap that beargarden with any serious impact.The book is more forgiving in its inconsistencies and characterizations, but that is more telling on the genius of the writer than the content of the tale itself.",2,M-O-O-N.

I bought the DVD as soon as it became available - it is one of my favorite films.  I loved the performance of Jamey Sheridan as Flagg (he has such an evil handsome grin) he was perfectly cast.  Gary Sinise as Stu Redman and Rob Lowe as Nick Andros were also wonderful choices to fill the large shoes created by Mr. King- not everyone could have done it so well.  There are more Ruby Dee, Ray Walston, Molly Ringwald (I like her performance, contrary to many people) and Laura San Giacomo (?) but you can't mention them all.  (Oh- don't forget that King makes several appearances in this one- not just a brief glimpse.)  The Stand is a book which is so long and detailed that there is no way it could have all been put into the film but Mr. King did an extraordinary job of compacting it into the time constrains of t.v.  The nice thing about owing the DVD is that you can jump to favorite scenes or past ones you may not like so easily.

360785,A1DZKOOMMJM1MI,6303153461,"Mark Twain ""Sam""","[1, 6]","Maybe my mistake with The Stand was cramming it into three viewings instead of spreading it out into four like its initial television release. What started off brilliantly quickly got repetitive and boring during the second disk. Of course, the storyline in itself is fascinating. What if the world came to an end and all that was left was good and evil, forced to fight it out in an all or nothing battle? However, there are too many characters to keep track of, too many shifts in location, and way too much going on.Stephen King films usually work well as a three-part miniseries, but the extra 90 minutes on this one was WAY too much. Two hours could have EASILY been cut from this, and the film would have been a lot stronger had that been the case. By Part 4, I just wanted it to be over, without really caring about what was going to happen. I was fascinated by the story, but the film itself was too slow and too boring. I really wish it had only been a 4 and a half hour film instead of a six hour one. I finished ""The Shining"" mini in one sitting and ""Rose Red"" in one and a half, but this was excruciating at parts and I had to keep stopping it and getting back to it later.Despite everything, the cast is amazing and it's hard to believe the film was made almost 10 years ago. Most of the effects are great, and some are not, but it does have that television feel to it, which can easily be overlooked. The characters are as strong as the story, which is why I was so disappointed in the end.The first 3 parts seemed to be leading to a great climactic showdown, but the ending disappoints, with Part 4 being the worst of the lot. The showdown was cheesy and the wrap-up  boring and sappy. So while The Stand has so many great things about it, in the end, it all falls short and ends up being pointless. I started off loving this, but I ended up hating it.

THE STAND is a long, involved epic about the battle between good and evil; God and the devil, and boasts some fine performances from its large cast.  I watched it in two sittings, as six hours a little too long to sit in front of a tv?  Anyway, director Mick Garris is to be credited for keeping the movie interesting most of the time, and his lapses come mostly in redundant scenes and slow pacing at times.  We all know the story, if not by reading the book, than by either viewing the film or reading other reviews.  What I would focus on at this time is some of the wonderful performances in the film; while most of the cast does fine, there are a few standouts:  Rob Lowe in a virtually non speaking role seems right at home as Nick Andros, conveying genuine emotion and sincerity; the marvelous Ruby Dee took a rather annoying character and fleshed her out enough to enable us to tolerate her incessant preachiness; Bill Fagerbaake (sp) takes the stereotypical role of the retarded oaf and imbues it with such sincerity and naivete, he steals most of his scenes; Miguel Ferrer as henchman Floyd Henreid gives a good performance as a man whose own conscience gives him battle, and Ed Harris in a cameo role as the general in the first segment brings a sense of impending doom.  Other cameos include Kathy Bates, John Landis, and Kareem Abdul Jabaar.  Although Molly Ringwald doesn't ruin the film, she seems miscast with the older, more laconic Gary Sinese; and Corin Nemec doesn't bring the right kind of lunacy to his role as Harold Lauder.  Matt Frewer as Trashcan man and Laura San Giacomo's Nadine Cross seemed to be overacting, and it takes a while for Adam Storke's Larry Underwood to become convincing.Overall, though, THE STAND is a good representation of the mastery of King's work.",4,"AMBITIOUS, FLAWED BUT IMPRESSIVE",1139270400,"02 7, 2006",2006,1900,"['six', 'hour', 'version', 'hit', 'miniseries', 'one', 'better', 'adaptations', 'Stephen', 'King', 'works', 'STAND', 'long', 'involved', 'epic', 'battle', 'good', 'evil', 'God', 'devil', 'fine', 'performances', 'large', 'cast', 'watched', 'two', 'sittings', 'six', 'hours', 'little', 'too', 'long', 'sit', 'front', 'tv', 'Anyway', 'director', 'Mick', 'Garris', 'be', 'credited', 'keeping', 'movie', 'interesting', 'most', 'time', 'lapses', 'come', 'mostly', 'redundant', 'scenes', 'slow', 'pacing', 'times', 'know', 'story', 'not', 'reading', 'book', 'viewing', 'film', 'reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'What', 'would', 'focus', 'time', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'film', 'most', 'cast', 'fine', 'are', 'few', 'standouts', 'Rob', 'Lowe', 'virtually', 'non', 'speaking', 'role', 'right', 'home', 'Nick', 'Andros', 'conveying', 'genuine', 'emotion', 'sincerity', 'marvelous', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'took', 'rather', 'annoying', 'character', 'fleshed', 'out', 'enough', 'enable', 'tolerate', 'incessant', 'preachiness', 'Bill', 'Fagerbaake', 'sp', 'stereotypical', 'role', 'retarded', 'oaf', 'imbues', 'such', 'sincerity', 'naivete', 'most', 'scenes', 'Miguel', 'Ferrer', 'henchman', 'Floyd', 'Henreid', 'good', 'performance', 'man', 'own', 'conscience', 'battle', 'Ed', 'Harris', 'cameo', 'role', 'general', 'first', 'segment', 'sense', 'impending', 'doom', 'Other', 'cameos', 'include', 'Kathy', 'Bates', 'John', 'Landis', 'Kareem', 'Abdul', 'Jabaar', 'Molly', 'Ringwald', ""n't"", 'ruin', 'film', 'miscast', 'older', 'more', 'laconic', 'Gary', 'Sinese', 'Corin', 'Nemec', ""n't"", 'bring', 'right', 'kind', 'lunacy', 'role', 'Harold', 'Lauder', 'Matt', 'Frewer', 'Trashcan', 'man', 'Laura', 'San', 'Giacomo', 'Nadine', 'Cross', 'seemed', 'be', 'overacting', 'while', 'Adam', 'Storke', 'Larry', 'Underwood', 'become', 'convincing.Overall', 'though', 'STAND', 'good', 'representation', 'mastery', 'King', 'work']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

It was like two movies spliced together.The begining of the movie was strong, with a story line not too unbelievable.  With a man-made super virus or bacteria gone wrong and horribly slipping into the general public and erraticating 99% of the population.  From there it is all down hill.The movie then goes into a good vs. evil mode, with the survivors of this horrible plague having some sort of mass hypnotic dream about an elderly woman in Nebraska, telling them to come to her, and an evil being hanging around the fringes of the dreams and in these survivors lifes.The story line then becomes uninteresting with the ""characters"" and I mean unbelievable characters, traveling to Nebraska and then onto Colorado.From the deaf mute meeting the mentally handicapped man, and teaming up, to the schitsophrenic woman leaving New York with her fellow male traveling companion, then abandoning him, because she has a dream about this fringe devil-man telling her to come to him.  She is all into being evil and doing harm to everyone, but when she finally meets this demon that she has been in the service of, and in some sort of love with, she is put off by him and kills herself. Stink, stink stink.The whole good versus evil and religous undertone of the second half of the movie is bad.  The worst scene of all was the end with God's hand appearing in downtown Vegas, and igniting a nuclear warhead that has been brought into town by an evil pyro-lunatic. Thus erraticating all the evil people that the plague didn't get, and oh, yeah, the evil demon too.One question for Mr. King. How does a nuclear bomb destroy an evil, underworld, supernatural, being who is not mortal???Like I said, stink, stink, stink.King should have stayed with the plague plot line, and expanded it to include what would have really happened in this kind of event. Like fresh food or hording of supplies and the struggles with the horrid realities of dealing with the thousands/millions of dead bodies in any city. The lice, flys, rats and unclean living conditions that would have brought on a real plague, and panic. Not just throwing the dead bodies out of a house you now claim as your own, or moving them to the side of the road. This movie also never touches what happened to the rest of the world.This is a six hour movie, and there are plenty of plots and sub-plots.

I think I've learned my lesson about Stephen King movies based on books. Most of them [stink]. I don't know why they almost always happen to be so bad, but they just do. The only one I thought was great was Pet Sematary, which the thought of still manages to scare me to this day. The movie isn't that scary anymore, but I still wouldn't watch it by myself. The idea behind it just creeps me out. It's probably because I'm an animal lover. I can't even stand any scary stories dealing with animals, well, it depends on what happens with the animals. Evil animals usually just scare me. Anyway, I also remember liking The Langoliers and Storm Of The Century. I haven't seen those for so long though that I have no idea how I'd feel about them now...Also, am I the only one who felt like a chunk of this movie was missing in between part 2 and part 3? I could have swore I missed something, but I double checked, and I hadn't missed a thing. Since that's really how the movie went and I didn't miss anything, I really think the connection of the two parts was poorly put together. It just felt like something was missing, and I still can't get over it. It seemed like so many things happened between these two parts, and we aren't really explained anything.I had always wanted to see this movie, but if I would have known how [bad] and uninteresting it was, I never would have rented it...

Stephen King has admitted that this story was influenced by the Revelations chapter in the Bible. The Emmies gave it a number of nominations, including Best Miniseries. Originally, parts of the miniseries were to be filmed on location in Boulder, Colorado. After the passage of Colorado Amendment, which nullified local gay rights laws, the production was moved to Utah in protest.

Revelation 6:8Stephen King's epic novel was finally brought to the small screen in the mid-nineties. The long-awaited adaptation features an array of carefully crafted characters, survivors of a plague that wipes out most of the world's population. Essentially there are two groups who have survived the man-made virus known as the super flu: one who will follow Mother Abigail Freemantle [a messenger of God], and those who are tempted by Randall Flagg [suggested in the story as being the devil]. Each character experiences vivid dreams that feature either Mother Abigail or Flagg and is told to meet others of their kind in order to prepare for the ultimate fight between good and evil. The super-flu itself represents the end of mankind as told within the pages of the bible, Flagg being likened to one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Death, who rides a pale [sickly] horse and spreads plague and pestilence among those mortals who walk the earth. Those who are immune to the disease signal a chance for a new beginning.As the streets become choked with bodies and the survivors light funeral pyres for the dead, it becomes evident that only one of the two groups can triumph. It is time for those who can still see good in mankind to take a stand.The TV mini-series [6 hours in total] tracks the progress of each character in detail, although not in nearly as much depth as King achieves in his book. Like Dickens before him, King's characters are colorful and diverse:Those who follow the aging Mother Abigail [Ruby Dee] to the Free Zone include a deaf mute [Rob Lowe], a retarded man-child [Bill Fagerbakke] a female student [Molly Ringwald], a quiet homely guy [Gary Sinise], a musician [Adam Storke], a retired judge [Ossie Davis] and a professor of sociology [Ray Walston] ... oh, and Kojak the dog, who outlived his master.Those who follow the Darkman [Jamey Sheridan] to Las Vegas include a criminal [Miguel Ferrer], a schizophrenic pyromaniac [Matt Frewer], an unstable teenage girl [Shawnee Smith] and two troubled characters who are seduced by Flagg and defect [Laura San Giacomo; Corin Nemec].The result being: educated, creative and good-natured characters Vs the dregs of humanity.Mick Garris is the man to bring 'The Stand' from book to screen, having directed other King works such as 'The Shining' TV, 'Quicksilver Highway', 'Riding the Bullet', 'Desperation' and 'Sleepwalkers'.'The Stand' also features Ed Harris and cameos by Stephen King, Mick Garris [director], Sam Raimi, John Landis [dir. American Werewolf in London] and Tom Holland [dir. Thinner & The Langoliers].

I  regard that as a plus.Character detail. Although the movie is six hours  long, it doesn't give you the same amount of character development as the  novel does. In truth, the the movie would have to be twice as long to do  this -- and would probably end up as less of a story.

Considering King is such an enormous phenonmenon you'd think they would take a book like The Stand, which is amazing, and do a grand movie production with good acting, good special effects, and good directing. This movie has none of that. It's a sappy, corny piece of junk that does nothing but degrade the book. The book was so powerful and the movie was so boring! I was looking foward to a good relationship with Stu and Franny and got zip. Molly Ringwald (?) was a LOUSY Franny!One thing about this story (book or movie). Did anyone notice that in the midst of the whole &quot;good versus evil&quot; thing that the heros of the story had nothing to do with vanquishing the evil?

This is my favorite King novel, and he must have approved, since he has an appearance. This is so complicated that I didn't think it could be coherently put to film...but it works. Acting is very good throughout, especially Jamey Sheridan as the bad guy (It's hard to watch ""Law & Order"" now.) He was THAT good. There are inside jokes, my favorite being the appearance of Joe Bob Briggs, who did a late-nite horror show and always said how much he hates Molly Ringwald. This is King's biggest novel...and I know he knows it's his best. The 8 hour TV version does well on DVD at only 6 hours (minus commercials). To tell the story in less time would be a travesty. The acting is generally fine, with Sheridan as a standout. I liked Ruby Dee a lot, and thought Rob Lowe was fine. A brief tough-as-nails cameo by Kathy Bates was great.

MILLER,"[6, 6]","If you read the book, you noticed that the above spelling was character Tom Cullen's spelling for any word or phrase, and King kept that in for this film. Say what you want--this miniseries came out quite awhile after the viewing public got bored with epics like &quot;Roots&quot;, &quot;Shogun&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;Winds Of War&quot;. Actually, the viewers had lost their taste for any TV movie that ran more than two nights. As a matter of fact, that's the current definition of the term &quot;miniseries&quot;: a two-part movie. The fact that this one is twice that and still ran--indeed that it's still in print--is a testament to its quality. There's some miscasting to be sure--I can't see Molly Ringwald as Frannie--but Ruby Dee as Mother Abagail more than counterbalances it. As does Ray Walston as Glen Bateman. And Matt Frewer has always been good at playing wackos, so he is a natural for Trashcan Man. Some scenes had to be trimmed from the book or it would have ended up as a twelve-parter--after &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;, I think they must have passed a law or something. Some characters have been combined (like Rita Blakemoor and Nadine Cross) for brevity, but all in all, Stephen King films have always been among the closest to the book version as you can get. After all, as a contrast, only a few James Bond movies have even been close to their print counterparts. With that in mind, who would scrap a scene as powerful as the meeting of deaf mute Nick Andros and Mother Abagail?

The clarity of the picture is astonishing, the sound is truly deep and sharp, and the music is piquant and  stimulating.  I'm a King fan, yes, but I'm not partial to bad movies of his  work.  This movie is SENSATIONAL.  The acting, directing, camerawork --  everything shines and it's a joy to have a clean, sharp, beautifully  recorded DVD of it.My complaints are with the commentary -- one of the  special features.  If anyone has heard the various commentaries on  &quot;The Matrix&quot;  (I think there are three), you probably know just  how intensely interesting and descriptive the various folks behind the  scene CAN be in a commentary.  On &quot;The Stand,&quot; you have King, the  director and a few of the actors -- not necessarily easily identified --  making random comments throughout the 6-hour film.  At first, you think  things are going to be fine, but you suddenly realize that this actor's  recollections don't jibe with the scene currently playing ... the various  people were apparently interviewed separately and then had their interviews  laid on to the commentary track ... randomly, it seems ... and often  repetitively.  I don't know how many times we need to hear Ruby Dee  describe her favorite scene in the film ... but, damn!  Although King  makes interesting observations, he clearly does not get that many of his  fans make more of his story -- and its meaning -- than he does.  King  thinks that &quot;The Stand&quot; is a metaphor for starting the world over  again without any reminder of previous technology.  Never mind, then, that  babies should not be born in hospitals, that water should not be  sterilized, that heating homes should not rely on electric power, that Stu  and Tom should never have had access to the Sno-Cat that returned them  safely to Boulder, etc., etc.  He is full of pronouncements but his story  clearly refutes his own personal stand against man's technological  achievements.  It would have been interesting to hear him discuss his ideas  more in depth, and there was time for him to do so, too.  There are LONG  stretches during the commentary play where all we hear is movie....and I'd  already seen the movie.The movie is worth every cent of the selling  price of the DVD....but don't get your hopes up about the commentary.",5,Great Movie with Lousy Commentary,944438400,"12 6, 1999",1999,2397,"['quot', 'Stand', 'quot', 'DVD', 'event', 'six', 'hours', 'programming', 'one', 'CD-sized', 'disc', 'awesome', 'clarity', 'picture', 'astonishing', 'sound', 'truly', 'deep', 'sharp', 'music', 'piquant', 'stimulating', ""'m"", 'King', 'fan', 'yes', ""'m"", 'not', 'partial', 'bad', 'movies', 'work', 'movie', 'SENSATIONAL', 'acting', 'directing', 'camerawork', 'everything', 'shines', 'joy', 'have', 'clean', 'sharp', 'beautifully', 'recorded', 'DVD', 'it.My', 'complaints', 'are', 'commentary', 'one', 'special', 'features', 'anyone', 'heard', 'various', 'commentaries', 'quot', 'Matrix', 'quot', 'think', 'are', 'three', 'probably', 'know', 'just', 'how', 'intensely', 'interesting', 'descriptive', 'various', 'folks', 'scene', 'CAN', 'be', 'commentary', 'quot', 'Stand', 'quot', 'have', 'King', 'director', 'few', 'actors', 'not', 'necessarily', 'easily', 'identified', 'making', 'random', 'comments', '6-hour', 'film', 'first', 'think', 'things', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'fine', 'suddenly', 'realize', 'actor', 'recollections', 'do', ""n't"", 'jibe', 'scene', 'currently', 'playing', 'various', 'people', 'were', 'apparently', 'interviewed', 'separately', 'then', 'had', 'interviews', 'laid', 'commentary', 'track', 'randomly', 'often', 'repetitively', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'how', 'many', 'times', 'need', 'hear', 'Ruby', 'Dee', 'favorite', 'scene', 'film', 'damn', 'King', 'interesting', 'observations', 'clearly', 'not', 'get', 'many', 'fans', 'make', 'more', 'story', 'meaning', 'King', 'thinks', 'quot', 'Stand', 'quot', 'metaphor', 'starting', 'world', 'again', 'reminder', 'previous', 'technology', 'Never', 'mind', 'then', 'babies', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'born', 'hospitals', 'water', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'sterilized', 'heating', 'homes', 'should', 'not', 'rely', 'electric', 'power', 'Stu', 'Tom', 'should', 'never', 'have', 'had', 'access', 'Sno-Cat', 'returned', 'safely', 'Boulder', 'etc.', 'etc', 'full', 'pronouncements', 'story', 'clearly', 'own', 'personal', 'stand', 'man', 'technological', 'achievements', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'hear', 'discuss', 'ideas', 'more', 'depth', 'there', 'was', 'time', 'do', 'so', 'too', 'are', 'LONG', 'stretches', 'commentary', 'play', 'where', 'hear', 'movie', '.and', ""'d"", 'already', 'seen', 'movie.The', 'movie', 'worth', 'cent', 'selling', 'price', 'DVD', '.but', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'hopes', 'up', 'commentary']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS
360812,A2R1HAXRNU0QX7,6303153461,RMurray847,"[10, 15]","Stephen King is one of my favorite authors, and THE STAND is one of my two or three favorites of his.  So I had a mixture of excitement and dread when the mini-series first aired years ago.  But I watched, and was overall pleased.  This week, I watched it again, so my kids could see it, and my reaction was mixed again...although as is so often the case with TV products, they don't age very well.One small example.  The character of Randall Flagg (by the way, if you don't know the story, don't look for a summary here...I'd hate to try), who is supposed to be this really dangerous, crazy, powerful, charismatic, ""devilish"" creature, comes across mostly as a bit peevish.  His clothes, including denim jacket and overtight jeans, don't help the image, but it's his hair that is so funny.  Long, flowing dark locks than sometimes dangerously hint of a mullet.  This does not instill fear in the modern viewer.THE STAND is very well produced for a television ""event.""  These things are on tight budgets and have to be filmed in half the time or less of a comparable movie.  Special effects money is very hard to come by.  And it shows in spots.  The climactic scene in Las Vegas loses some of its potential power by virtue of some hokey effects.But despite the fact that this story has lots of ""plot,"" it is really a character driven piece...because it's so important that we care about the people in order for the book's events to matter to us at all.  In this the book was fantastically successful.  Each major (and many minor) character left an indelible impression.  The mini-series is less successful.First, the successes.  Gary Sinese plays Stu, the main ""good guy,"" and although in reading the book I would not have pictures Sinese AT ALL, he's a good actor who brings an everyman intelligence to all his roles, and it works very well here.  He's the anchor for the show.Rob Lowe plays deaf/mute Nic Andros, and sometimes he's just a kind of ""dewy-eyed"" saint, looking all loving and understanding.  But after awhile, we believe that he really is this noble, and Lowe plays the part with conviction.  This was his first real shot at redemption after all the scandals had surrounded him, and it helped set him back on this way to stuff like WEST WING.Adam Storke plays the other ""main"" good guy, Larry Underwood.  In the early scenes, when he's mostly an obnoxious rock star, it's hard to buy.  I'm not sure where his accent is coming from, and he doesn't really seem convincing as a star.  But he grows into his character, and suddenly by the midpoint of the series, we see he's really grown into the part and we are able to empathize with him.Bill Fagerbaack (I'm going on memory of the name here...sorry) plays the mentally challenged Tom Cullen.  It's a tough role, because it teeters on caricature, but the actor makes it his own and we really like the character.  Miguel Ferrer as Lloyd is outstanding as always.  Here's an actor that is STILL due his full accolades.  He's good in pretty much everything he does.  He makes Lloyd a great character.  Ruby Dee as Mother Abigail is just right, and her husband Ozzie Davis in a small role is also always a commanding presence.  Matt Frewer is delightfully over-the-top in the smallish but pivotal role of Trashcan Man.  The actresses who play both Lucy and Dana (I'm sorry I can't name them) are both terrific, and modulated.  They are able to act in a story that's a bit outrageous, and make the parts still seem rooted in reality.The other two major actresses in the show don't achieve this balance, however.  Poor Laura San Giacomo is pretty bad as Natalie, Randall Flagg's intended bride.  Her character is supposed to be a bit crazy, but San Giacomo is right off the map.  Shrill and nasal at the same time.  Not in the least bit believable at any moment of the show.  But she's ""matched"" by Molly Ringwald, who no doubt hoped this role would help her transition into ""adult"" parts.  The results are a mess.  She still comes across as a child, and not a very mature one at that.  Her efforts at emotion are paper-thin and unconvincing.  While some argue that it's an underwritten part, it is also a somewhat ""real"" person too.  No special powers, just a solid individual trying to make the best of things, be strong, and bring a baby into a crazy world.  Instead, Ringwald's Fran is just a mess.  Others who fail in their roles include the young man playing Harold...he is certainly annoying, but mostly because he's so bad.  And Jamey Sheridan as Randall Flagg was a big goof.  Couldn't they have found someone with gravitas.  I've seen him in roles recently, as things like Police Chiefs or Politician, and he's better now.  But in THE STAND, he just doesn't pull off threatening.  Part of it is the hair, part might be the dialogue, but a big chunk of the blame rests on the actor.Overall, this is a show worth seeing.  It's still a good story.  It keeps your interest.  But you can't help turning if off at the final credits and wondering what it might have been with a more solid cast.I recommend it, but not by much.  In about 10 years, when technology is much advanced, I'd like to see it remade.  Get a better cast and use CGI to make some real crowd scenes and scenes of devastation.  Anyway, until that happens, go ahead and check this one out.",3,"Solid adaptation, with some big flaws",1121299200,"07 14, 2005",2005,5319,"['Stephen', 'King', 'one', 'favorite', 'authors', 'STAND',

The Stand is one of those rare translation from page to screen gems.  Previous believable adaptations of King's books  are The Shawshank Redemption (of course), Misery, The Dark Half, The  Shining (Kubrick version, although I admit this one was not really true to  the book), 'Salem's Lot, and Stand By Me (based on the novella The Body).  The rest have just been undeniably horrible to the constant disgust of  Stephen King fans.  Thinner anyone?  So when The Stand came out in 1994 my  expectations were high but I was ready for a letdown.  That, thank God,  never came.  What came out in little pixels of color and constant blinking  lights was so engrossing and so well made that I forgot I was watching  television.  That's good stuff folks.  I kept saying throughout the  mini-series &quot;I remember that&quot; and &quot;Yep, straight outta the  book&quot;.  Of course it is impossible to convey the same feeling one gets  from reading a book where one shapes the characters and gives them his/her  own face and voice but this was a pretty damn good substitute for primetime  television.

Generally this is faithful to the book, but unfortunately some aspects of the story aren't explored as fully as they could be and other storylines are adapted or removed altogether. Considering how detailed the book is and how it would need to be altered for screen this is understandable. The reason I gave this three stars is that with the exception of Gary Sinise, and a few other minor characters, the acting is extremely wooden. The sets and overall style are a touch dated as well, but it tends not to detract from the story or your enjoyment too much. If you like the book then this mini-series is well worth a try and if the book's length daunts you then this is a great way to get to know the story without spending hours reading.

360823,AATKF0HDBQL86,6303153461,"S. Smith ""ltcolkiranerys""","[61, 67]","As Stephen King himself has said, The Stand is taken straight out of the Book of Revelations in the Bible, and this, in my opinion, makes the miniseries a classic tale of good versus evil.  With nearly all the world's population dead due to a genetically engineered virus, the survivors begin to coalesce into two groups--one led by the benevolent Mother Abagail, and the other by the demonic Randall Flagg.  It might seem through the first 3 parts of the miniseries that Flagg's group are in the ascendancy, but Mother Abagail & Co. have quite a few tricks up their sleeves.The crop of actors in Stephen King's The Stand were a great bunch as well.  Gary Sinise was perfect for the part of Stu Redman, the country boy from small-town Texas, and Molly Ringwald as Fran Goldsmith was very good.  Adam Storke made a very believable Larry Underwood, and the casting of Coach's Bill Fagerbakke as Tom Cullen was an inspired choice.  I especially loved the late Ray Walston as Glen Bateman, Jamey Sheridan as Flagg, Ruby Dee and her husband Ossie Davis in their respective parts of Mother Abagail and Judge Farris, Rob Lowe as Nick Andros, Just Shoot Me's Laura San Giacomo as Nadine Cross, the late Rosemary Clooney's son Miguel Ferrer as Lloyd Henreid, and Max Headroom's Matt Frewer as Trashcan Man.  I had no complaints about Stargate SG-1's Corin (Corky) Nemec as Harold Lauder except for the fact that they could have plumped him out a bit for the part and had him lose weight so he'd be slender once he got to Boulder.  Other than that, his acting was excellent.I'd also like to give a nod to two very wonderful actors whose parts were uncredited, but who nevertheless made a valuable contribution to the story: Apollo 13's Ed Harris as General Starkey, the commander of Blue Base (where the virus is made) and Misery's Kathy Bates as talk-radio host Rae Flowers, whose refusal to withhold the truth from the American people earns her a bullet in the head.  Although you only see them in Part 1 of the miniseries, their roles were brilliantly acted and necessary to the story.The Making of Stephen King's The Stand documentary, included on both DVD and VHS, gave some good insights into the filming of this wonderfully scary miniseries.  When I found out how much work had gone into making it, I was astonished, and when I discovered that hundreds of King fans had flocked to Vegas for some of the crowd scenes there, I found myself turning green with envy.  I wish I had been there...  The DVD also includes commentary by the principal actors and crew as well as Stephen King himself, along with a Make-Up Effects gallery, which includes Randall Flagg's transformations and the old-age makeup used on Ruby Dee as Mother Abagail.All in all, Stephen King's The Stand is a keeper.

Unlike most long movies, even slow parts explained alot and had a way to draw you in. I never seen this when it was on tv, but when I bought the dvd 'its 2 dvd's', I expected to watch part one the first day, part two the second etc... as dvd #1 has part 1 and 2, and dvd #2 has part 3 and 4 respectivly, but I found Myself just watching all 4 parts approx 6 hours all in one sitting I was so hooked :) ... and seen MANY times over since!Even the intro music 'Dont Fear the Reaper' by Blue &Ouml;yster Cult was a really nice unexpected touch =)The pick for actors and actresses could not have been better. You can find a part of yourself in each charecter, good or evil. This movie is very psychological with many things to make you just sit and wonder for hours, even days after you seen it... and still find yourself watching it again, and again, and again...I know some were upset by Stephen King using alot of Christian emphases in the movie, but personally I thought it was a nice touch and done with extream good taste, and... it was His book/movie to do as He wished. Anyone who dont like it, write your own book with your own theme :PThe movie starts with a military grade super flu that leaks out with no cure, which, could possably happen in real life. However no one knows why but a few are immune while everyone else dies leaving a small population of the human race left. While everyone is in the stage of dieing anarchy is everywhere among the people to the government declairing marshall law.This is just the very beginning as it deepens with the deaths of all the sick with the super flu aka captian trips by its so called west coast name in the movie.Soon, the survivors start having visions/dreams of 2 differant entities, one being an old black woman 'Mother Abigale', who represents all good trying to draw the suvivors to her area to start a new colony from G~d speaking to Her in dreams, and the other, a hippie type biker who you are led to belive is satan 'Randal Flagg', but thru out the whole movie he is never directly referd to as satan or the 'devil' to try and gain his following of people to start a differant colony. Stephen King did a superb job on this as there is no doubt this hippie biker in the desert is satan or 'the devil' but never actually referd to as such...As stated, the movie is extreamly psychological and you can find even a small trace of yourself in each person and even situation in one form or another, which really makes one think hard about many things, such as the survivors, both the good going onward to 'Mother Abigail' or the bad pilgramiging to 'Randal Flagg', not just the colonies they build later, but even the journies of each party as they slowly meet on the road and what happens to each while on their journeys to either colony...Still... theres even more, much much more yet to come, but Ill stop here... B-)A MUST see for anyone who has not seen this movie as you can find a part of yourself in this as well as just good entertainment even.My oppinion, this 'was/is/ever will be' the finest book made into a movie from Stephen King ever. If I could I would definatly give more then 5 stars except amazon.com limits to only 5 :PI may have to buy another back up copy of The Stand as Ive watched My version so much I think I actually wearing out the disks =)Enjoy!",5,M.O.O.N. that spells GREATEST movie ever ! ! !,1103068800,"12 15, 2004",2004,3417,"['Stand', 'anyone', 'who', 'seen', 'very', 'long', 'movie', 'fast', 'most', 'long', 'movies', 'even', 'slow', 'parts', 'explained', 'alot', 'had', 'way', 'draw', 'never', 'seen', 'when', 'was', 'tv', 'when', 'bought', 'dvd', '2', 'dvd', 'expected', 'watch', 'part', 'one', 'first', 'day', 'part', 'two', 'second', 'etc', 'dvd', '1', 'part', '1', '2', 'dvd', '2', 'part', '3', '4', 'respectivly', 'found', 'Myself', 'just', 'watching', '4', 'parts', 'approx', '6', 'hours', 'one', 'sitting', 'was', 'so', 'hooked', 'seen', 'MANY', 'times', 'Even', 'intro', 'music', ""'Dont"", 'Fear', 'Reaper', 'Blue', 'Ouml', 'yster', 'Cult', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'unexpected', 'touch', '=', 'pick', 'actors', 'actresses', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'can', 'find', 'part', 'charecter', 'good', 'evil', 'movie', 'very', 'psychological', 'many', 'things', 'make', 'just', 'sit', 'wonder', 'hours', 'even', 'days', 'seen', 'still', 'find', 'watching', 'again', 'again', 'again', 'know', 'were', 'upset', 'Stephen', 'King', 'using', 'alot', 'Christian', 'emphases', 'movie', 'personally', 'thought', 'was', 'nice', 'touch', 'done', 'extream', 'good', 'taste', 'was', 'book/movie', 'do', 'wished', 'Anyone', 'who', 'write', 'own', 'book', 'own', 'theme', 'PThe', 'movie', 'military', 'grade', 'super', 'flu', 'out', 'cure', 'could', 'possably', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'However', 'one', 'why', 'few', 'are', 'immune', 'everyone', 'else', 'leaving', 'small', 'population', 'human', 'race', 'left', 'everyone', 'stage', 'dieing', 'anarchy', 'everywhere', 'people', 'government', 'declairing', 'marshall', 'law.This', 'just', 'very', 'beginning', 'deaths', 'sick', 'super', 'flu', 'aka', 'captian', 'trips', 'so', 'called', 'west', 'coast', 'name', 'movie.Soon', 'survivors', 'start', 'having', 'visions/dreams', '2', 'differant', 'entities', 'one', 'being', 'old', 'black', 'woman', 'Abigale', 'who', 'good', 'trying', 'draw', 'suvivors', 'area', 'start', 'new', 'colony', 'G~d', 'speaking', 'Her', 'dreams', 'other', 'hippie', 'type', 'biker', 'who', 'are', 'led', 'belive', 'satan', 'Flagg', 'out', 'whole', 'movie', 'never', 'directly', 'satan', ""'devil"", 'try', 'gain', 'following', 'people', 'start', 'differant', 'colony', 'Stephen', 'King', 'did', 'superb', 'job', 'doubt', 'hippie', 'biker', 'desert', 'satan', 'devil', 'never', 'actually', 'referd', 'such', 'stated', 'movie', 'extreamly', 'psychological', 'can', 'find', 'even', 'small', 'trace', 'person', 'even', 'situation', 'one', 'form', 'really', 'one', 'think', 'hard', 'many', 'things', 'such', 'survivors', 'good', 'going', 'onward', ""'Mother"", 'Abigail', 'bad', 'pilgramiging', ""'Randal"", 'Flagg', 'not', 'just', 'colonies', 'build', 'later', 'even', 'journies', 'party', 'slowly', 'meet', 'road', 'what', 'while', 'journeys', 'colony', 'Still', 'even', 'more', 'much', 'much', 'more', 'yet', 'come', 'Ill', 'stop', 'here', 'B-', 'A', 'MUST', 'see', 'anyone', 'who', 'not', 'seen', 'movie', 'can', 'find', 'part', 'yourself', 'as', 'well', 'just', 'good', 'entertainment', 'even.My', 'oppinion', ""'was/is/ever"", 'will', 'be', 'finest', 'book', 'made', 'movie', 'Stephen', 'King', 'ever', 'could', 'would', 'definatly', 'give', 'more', 'then', '5', 'stars', 'amazon.com', 'limits', 'only', '5', 'PI', 'may', 'have', 'buy', 'back', 'up', 'copy', 'Stand', 'Ive', 'watched', 'My', 'version', 'so', 'much', 'think', 'actually', 'wearing', 'out', 'disks', '=', 'Enjoy']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

The scene with the reporters being stopped by the army was pathetic and Ed  Harris was completely wasted in the lamest possible sub-plot imaginable.  (An Army officer having an ephinany about some obscur poem and reciting it  during a crisis--GOOD LORD!) On the other hand, what about Ray Walston's  performance? What about Miguel Ferrer!

360828,A39U9CG766Y5TW,6303153461,"Tara Lohman ""constant reader""","[2, 4]","I just saw this miniseries again after years. I was so excited when this miniseries of my favorite of King's books came out, and I remember being blown away by the beginning, which was beautifully done.  But with 18 years between viewings, I can see how ridiculous and cheesy it really was. Let's see, where do I start?  Let's start with something shallow...the hair. Randall Flagg's hair was so ridiculous I wanted to laugh every time he was on.  He looked like some sad washed-up country gospel singer. He didn't do a bad job with the part, he chewed up the scenery pretty well and spit it out, but what can one do with a part like Flagg's? Nadine's hair was like a big fright wig, hanging everywhere and making her look like some crazy freak instead of the beautiful, sophisticated woman who steadily loses it as she gets closer to her ""wedding day."" The clothes....everyone's traveling to some portion of the west, but Julie Lawry is in these short full skirts and clumpy shoes that make her look like a Brazt doll. Frannie, a very capable woman, has a flowery, flowing dress of some type in nearly each scene even though she is riding a motorcyle across country, and what is that New Year's Eve clubbing outfit she wears to the first town meeting?  The women wear long scarves that would snap their heads off if they got caught in the cycles. Harold looks like some idiot about to enter his first leather bar.And the casting....Molly Ringwald as Frannie? What a joke.  She can't act in a way that portrays the hope and anguish and all the other feelings that Fran is experiencing.  Most of the time her idea of emotion is to make the same face she does when Michael Anthony Hall comes out holding up her panties in ""Sixteen Candles.""  Shawnee Smith playing Julie was a complete freak show, even without her weird clothes and hair. Other than the four main men, (who eventually go and make The Stand) the acting is just atrocious all the way around.Part of the best part of the book's ending is the long journey Tom and Stu make back to Boulder. But it is over in no time, and shows none of the hardships they experience. The movie could make multiple scenes showing the long trek as it steadily goes toward January...but no, they rush through and get there in November. That makes Fran's baby two months early. There is no way a 7-month premie would survive the superflu.  But the kid is six pounds something and not even in an isolette. Look up what a baby really looks like when it's two months early. And...for my last bit of nit-picking, if you look closely at the crib card in the last scene, she has a 30 inch chest and a 29 inch head.  Go ahead, get out a tape measure and take a gander at how big that is.  They could have left off a lot of the scenes, such as Trashcan Man staggering through the US saying Bumpty Bump, and devoted more time to the ending, which should have been even better than the beginning. But then the middle would still be pretty bad...",2,I sort of liked it back then....,1374105600,"07 18, 2013",2013,2973,"['just', 'saw', 'miniseries', 'again', 'years', 'was', 'so', 'excited', 'when', 'miniseries', 'favorite', 'King', 'books', 'came', 'out', 'remember', 'being', 'blown', 'away', 'beginning', 'was', 'beautifully', 'done', '18', 'years', 'viewings', 'can', 'see', 'how', 'ridiculous', 'cheesy', 'really', 'was', 'Let', 'see', 'where', 'do', 'start', 'Let', 'start', 'something', 'shallow', 'hair', 'Randall', 'Flagg', 'hair', 'was', 'so', 'ridiculous', 'wanted', 'laugh', 'time', 'was', 'looked', 'sad', 'washed-up', 'country', 'gospel', 'singer', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'bad', 'job', 'part', 'chewed', 'up', 'scenery', 'pretty', 'well', 'spit', 'out', 'what', 'can', 'one', 'do', 'part', 'Flagg', 'Nadine', 'hair', 'was', 'big', 'fright', 'wig', 'hanging', 'everywhere', 'making', 'look', 'crazy', 'freak', 'instead', 'beautiful', 'sophisticated', 'woman', 'who', 'steadily', 'closer', 'wedding', 'day', 'clothes', '.everyone', 'traveling', 'portion', 'west', 'Julie', 'Lawry', 'short', 'full', 'skirts', 'clumpy', 'shoes', 'make', 'look', 'Brazt', 'doll', 'Frannie', 'very', 'capable', 'woman', 'flowery', 'flowing', 'dress', 'type', 'nearly', 'scene', 'even', 'riding', 'motorcyle', 'country', 'what', 'New', 'Year', 'Eve', 'clubbing', 'outfit', 'first', 'town', 'meeting', 'women', 'wear', 'long', 'scarves', 'would', 'snap', 'heads', 'got', 'caught', 'cycles', 'Harold', 'idiot', 'enter', 'first', 'leather', 'bar.And', 'casting', '.Molly', 'Ringwald', 'Frannie', 'What', 'joke', 'ca', ""n't"", 'act', 'way', 'hope', 'anguish', 'other', 'feelings', 'Fran', 'experiencing', 'Most', 'time', 'idea', 'emotion', 'make', 'same', 'face', 'when', 'Michael', 'Anthony', 'Hall', 'out', 'holding', 'up', 'panties', 'Sixteen', 'Candles', 'Shawnee', 'Smith', 'playing', 'Julie', 'was', 'complete', 'freak', 'show', 'even', 'weird', 'clothes', 'hair', 'Other', 'four', 'main', 'men', 'who', 'eventually', 'go', 'make', 'Stand', 'acting', 'just', 'atrocious', 'way', 'around.Part', 'best', 'part', 'book', 'ending', 'long', 'journey', 'Tom', 'Stu', 'make', 'back', 'Boulder', 'time', 'none', 'hardships', 'experience', 'movie', 'could', 'make', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'showing', 'long', 'trek', 'steadily', 'January', 'rush', 'get', 'there', 'November', 'Fran', 'baby', 'two', 'months', 'early', 'way', '7-month', 'premie', 'would', 'survive', 'superflu', 'kid', 'six', 'pounds', 'something', 'not', 'even', 'isolette', 'Look', 'up', 'what', 'baby', 'really', 'when', 'two', 'months', 'early', 'last', 'bit', 'nit-picking', 'look', 'closely', 'crib', 'card', 'last', 'scene', '30', 'inch', 'chest', '29', 'inch', 'head', 'Go', 'ahead', 'get', 'out', 'tape', 'measure', 'take', 'gander', 'how', 'big', 'could', 'have', 'left', 'off', 'lot', 'scenes', 'such', 'Trashcan', 'Man', 'staggering', 'US', 'saying', 'Bumpty', 'Bump', 'devoted', 'more', 'time', 'ending', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'even', 'better', 'beginning', 'then', 'middle', 'would', 'still', 'be', 'pretty', 'bad']",Stephen King's The Stand VHS

Say the book is good, or bad, don't say how it ends,Now, that off my chest-I have a strange quirk.  I like to read the book of a good movie and watch the movie of a book.  For instance if you want to see the movie that even the stars Patricia Neal and Gary Cooper consider one of the worst they've ever starred in watch ""The Fountainhead"" by Ayn Rand.  Maybe if they'd barred her from the lot...but they didn't.Another example is the latest version of Les Miserables.  Without it we wouldn't know Russel Crowe and Hugh Jackman couldn't carry a tune in a milk bucket.But this review is about The Stand.I 'sort of' watched it when it was on TV.  However when I watched the movie this time I did not realize how emotionally affected I would be.I'm not a crying type person, but every time Ruby Dee came on the screen as Mother Abagail I did.  I thought that she was exceptional.I am also not a big Gary Sinise fan; but I think that might be the CSI thing.  A bad show and a bad part.  But in this movie I couldn't imagine anyone else.  In fact I think that every part was perfectly cast except for Nadine.  Somehow she didn't carry the weight that the character in the book did.  Plus that God awful wig. Did they get that at a Halloween store?There are two other actors that deserve raves also.  Some people have come down on Molly Ringwald in the part of Frannie.  I think that they are making the mistake I did with Gary.  They are stuck in the parts she played before, none of which called for the dramatic part she played here.  And of course Rob Lowe deserves accolades in his portrayal of Nick, although sometimes he read lips that he couldn't see.  And poor old Tom Cullen could easily have been made a caricature of his character, but he wasn't.  And the child, like Larry's New York girlfriend Rita, could have been left out since his character added nothing to the story.The unabridged version of the book runs almost 1500 words.  I think bringing it so faithfully to the screen was a major undertaking that worked.  Of course having Stephen King write the screen play didn't hurt either.If you want to see where this ain't working at all, try watching ""Atlas Shrugged"".  It should be Atlas sucked.If you are interested in other books with an 'end of civilization as we know it' theme I'd like to suggest a few.Of course the classic is ""Earth Abides"" by George R. Stewart.""One Second After"" by William Forstchen should be required reading for everyone in this country.  It details the events in a small town after an EMP, or Electro Magnetic Pulse, renders all electronics in the country useless.  Think about it because this is a VERY real possibility with certain countries having atomic capabilities.  A warhead can be bought in the old Soviet Union for the price of a BMW and rockets are everywhere.  All it takes is one, let me repeat that ONE atom bomb exploded above the atmosphere and overnight we become a third world country.And finally my favorite Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Nevin and Jerry Pouvnello.

Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.----------------------------------------When the word ""epic"" comes to mind I think of Stephen King.  King's works are amoung the greatest in the world.  Whether it's short stories or lengthy novels, the man can write, period.  Who out there hasn't been curled up in bed reading one of his works?'The Stand' definitely is one of Mr. King's top 10.  FYI, please please read the book before watching the mini-series.  The book is AMAZING, and you do not want to cheat yourself out of this experience.The mini-series is a direct adaptation from the book, and is one of the few adaptations that's is actually good.**Mini-Series Details/Spoilers Ahead**The 6 hour epic begins just as the book did, with an accidental outbreak of an engineered deadly flu virus, ""Captain Trip.""  The virus has a 99.4 percent kill rate.  So only .6 percent of the Earth's population will be immune and survive.  This first 2 hour segment is your classic viral outbreak movie, except that it hones in on the central characters and really makes you experience the loss they experience yourself.Things start to escalate pretty quickly.  The government begins quarantining most cities and panic runs rampent.  Both the book and movie are pretty descriptive in this regard.  People are dropping dead left and right, and there is no cure.  Peaceful lives are shattered, mothers, fathers, children die, leaving behind only a few to mourn them.In the end America is left in ruin.  Government is non-existant.  Streets are bare, everything is quiet, everywhere.This is when the next segment of the series starts.  The few survivors must find their new places in the world.  This is when Randall Flagg, the personification of evil makes his appearance.  Flagg, a character in many of King's works, is like the devil put into flesh.  He is sinister, and smiles incessantly, reveling in his darkness.  Flagg is like a predator waiting for his time to shine.  With the world in shambles, he is ready to make his presence known and to carve out his kingdom.But God will not have this.  Mother Abagail, an extremely old lady living by herself in Nebraska is chosen to become a prophet.  Somehow King makes this work in both the book and movie.  This show down between good and evil never gets too preachy or religious.  So even those who are not fans of religion will still enjoy this story.Both the movie and book are too lengthy to discuss here on Amazon in detail.  I'll just say that you see all the characters go through quite a lot of changes.  2 towns are established, one town following Mother Abagail, the other town in Las Vegas following Flagg.  I think it's funny that the evil town is in Las Vegas.  There is obviously a 'Lord of The Flies' element here.  The town of Mother Abagail is democratic and meets at least once a week to discuss and vote on issues regarding the town.  In Las Vegas, Flagg is the law, what he says goes, or he kills you.--Summing Up--The one other element about this mini-series outside of the GREAT story that stands out is the CAST.  Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, Rob Lowe, Jamie Sheridan, just to name a few off the top of my head.  The cast really throws themselves into their roles and the acting is TREMENDOUS.This shows on Sci-Fi at least twice a year.  So next time it shows, give it a shot.  I myself watched it for the first time 3 years ago.  I had just finished reading the book, (more or less), and rented the mini-series from my local video store.  I watched half of it that night, and the other half the next day.  I ended up buying this set from the video store, when it was down sizing.  It sits proudly on my shelf now.  I would even consider re-buying this someday on Blu-Ray if it ever gets released.Be advised this is a mammoth undertaking.  The book is huge, and the mini-series is long.  In all honestly I DID skip some parts of the book.  I WILL someday re-read the book.  Just know that if you commit to reading the book, it may take you 2 months to finish at a  casual pace.  The mini-series is apx 6 hours long, so that's a good chuck of time as well.  But in my opinion both are worth experiencing.Know that availability of 'The Stand' on DVD is limited.  I know that my set is the complete set, nothing is trimmed off it's content.  It also has some bonus features as well.  I am not sure if other releases are condensed or not.  You should do research on this.  OR you could just DVR it next time it's on tv...Anyway, that's my thoughts on this great mini-series.  Now if you'll excuse me I have to sneeze.

The Stand is one of the most captivatingly dark, and fiendishly riveting stories ever written, and they turn it into a made for television movie? TELEVISION? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? You can't get away with a damn thing on TV anymore. At least not as far as Stephen King story elements are concerned. Naturally, some of the most deliciously gruesome, and wonderfully disgusting story elements had to be left out. Such as the scene where Rita Blakemoore (who's character was completely cut from the mini-series) chokes to death in her tent on her own vomit. Also, the detail of the superflu was toned down. The dream sequences cut short. The list goes on and on.This brings an age-old question back to mind. Why in the hell does every single Stephen King mini-series have to air on ABC, huh? Why couldn't they have made this for HBO, instead? They would have had a hell of a lot more creative freedom, not to mention more time on their hands, and a more mature audience. It could have been five parts instead of only four, and all of the wonderfully crude, and ribald language could have been left in. Not like ABC, where Randall Flagg talks like a third grader. ""You look like kaka!"" Oh, please, give me a break!This crap didn't quite ruin the book for me, but it came awful damn close.
