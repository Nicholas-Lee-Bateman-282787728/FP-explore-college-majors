The trouble is that Peck has grown weary of having to prove his mettle time and time again.  He is headed home to Cayenne to reunite with his wife and young son from whom he has been estranged for eight years.Along the dusty trail, he stops to rest and quench his thirst at a saloon, where he is soon recognized by the locals.  While minding his own business he is coaxed into a gun duel with a young, snotty and irksome Richard Jaeckel.  Jaeckel unfortunately wins the silver medal in that battle.  Word gets out and Peck is soon stalked by Jaeckel's three brothers.Peck slows the brothers down by scaring off their horses on the route to Cayenne.  This gives him a small window of opportunity to convince his wife to re-establish the family.  He arrives in town and learns that the town marshall is none other than his old partner Mark Strett played by a sympathetic Millard Mitchell.  Peck refuses to leave town until Mitchell brokers a deal to allow Peck to meet with his wife and son.  The movie ends in the only way that these kind of movies could possibly end in 1950.",4,Old gunfighters can't just fade away,1076630400,"02 13, 2004",2004,1190,"['Gregory', 'Peck', 'Gunfighter', 'Jimmie', 'Ringo', 'lanky', 'Texan', 'acknowledged', 'be', 'fastest', 'gun', 'West', 'trouble', 'Peck', 'grown', 'weary', 'having', 'prove', 'mettle', 'time', 'time', 'again', 'headed', 'home', 'Cayenne', 'reunite', 'wife', 'young', 'son', 'whom', 'been', 'estranged', 'eight', 'dusty', 'trail', 'rest', 'quench', 'thirst', 'saloon', 'where', 'soon', 'recognized', 'locals', 'minding', 'own', 'business', 'coaxed', 'gun', 'duel', 'young', 'snotty', 'irksome', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'Jaeckel', 'unfortunately', 'silver', 'medal', 'battle', 'Word', 'out', 'Peck', 'soon', 'stalked', 'Jaeckel', 'three', 'brothers.Peck', 'brothers', 'down', 'scaring', 'off', 'horses', 'route', 'Cayenne', 'small', 'window', 'opportunity', 'convince', 'wife', 're-establish', 'family', 'town', 'town', 'marshall', 'none', 'other', 'old', 'partner', 'Mark', 'Strett', 'played', 'sympathetic', 'Millard', 'Mitchell', 'Peck', 'leave', 'town', 'Mitchell', 'brokers', 'deal', 'allow', 'Peck', 'meet', 'wife', 'son', 'movie', 'only', 'way', 'kind', 'movies', 'could', 'possibly', 'end', '1950']",N/A

269265,A3CN9CCJUNIPKT,6301801733,DJ Joe Sixpack,"[6, 7]","Wow.  One of the best westerns I've ever seen, that's for sure.  Everything about this film is spot-on perfect, from the cinematography and acting to the costuming, sound, blocking and general attention to detail... not to mention the script!  Gregory Peck stars as Jimmy Ringo, the fastest gun in the West, now turning to middle age, and ready to give up the life of a violent roustabout.  The trouble is, of course, that everywhere he goes, people know and fear him, and every would-be badman in the territory wants to knock him down a peg or two.  It's an old story, repeated in numerous pulps, films, dime novels and comicbooks over the years, but probably never as tersely and tensely as here.  Honestly, there's not a false or flat moment in this film; director Henry King delivers a mournful masterpiece, and Peck is stunning in his role as a weatherbeaten, tired old gunny who'd gladly chuck it all in, if it weren't for the burdensome reputation he'd spent his entire youth building.  Fans of the ""Lonesome Dove"" series should recognize the imprint of Jimmy Ringo, and his erstwhile pal, now the town marshall,  Mark Strett (played perfectly by Millard Mitchell), two old-timers who know that the hard life isn't really as glamourous as most folks think.

269267,A7Y6AVS576M03,6301801733,gobirds2,"[0, 0]","1950's THE GUNFIGHTER directed by Henry King is a great character study of the larger than life notion of the hired gunman. Gregory Peck's performance breaks down the mythology of the Western gunman and makes him a real a man who had hopes and aspirations and saw those dreams slip through his fingers and blow away like tumbleweed.The script by William Bowers, William Sellers, Andr&eacute; De Toth and Nunnally Johnson develop a familiar theme that is so central to many Westerns since. The focus is on the one way of life that has been outlived by time, the collapse of open space and the indistinct progress of civilization. And if that way of life has been characterized by human failures and transgressions, is redemption through a return to a conventional life possible?Director Henry King's use of screen time is quite amazing really. Shot in what can be considered real time, there is not a single shot wasted central to the theme and progression of the storyline. Truly, there is never a dull moment and the viewer is immediately captivated by Peck screen presence.Alfred Newman's score is very thought provoking and subtle and is an important enhancement to this central theme. THE GUNFIGHTER also has a strong cast that strengthens the narrative with the likes of Karl Malden, Skip Homeier, Richard Jaeckel, Kenneth Tobey, Ellen Corby, Helen Westcott and Alan Hale Jr.",5,A Time and Place,1336953600,"05 14, 2012",2012,1380,"['1950', 'THE', 'GUNFIGHTER', 'directed', 'Henry', 'King', 'great', 'character', 'study', 'larger', 'life', 'notion', 'hired', 'gunman', 'Gregory', 'Peck', 'performance', 'breaks', 'down', 'mythology', 'Western', 'gunman', 'real', 'man', 'who', 'had', 'hopes', 'aspirations', 'saw', 'dreams', 'slip', 'fingers', 'blow', 'away', 'tumbleweed.The', 'script', 'William', 'Bowers', 'William', 'Sellers', 'Andr', 'eacute', 'De', 'Toth', 'Nunnally', 'Johnson', 'develop', 'familiar', 'theme', 'so', 'central', 'many', 'Westerns', 'focus', 'one', 'way', 'life', 'been', 'outlived', 'time', 'collapse', 'open', 'space', 'indistinct', 'progress', 'civilization', 'way', 'life', 'been', 'characterized', 'human', 'failures', 'transgressions', 'redemption', 'return', 'conventional', 'life', 'possible', 'Director', 'Henry', 'King', 'use', 'screen', 'time', 'quite', 'amazing', 'really', 'Shot', 'what', 'can', 'be', 'considered', 'real', 'time', 'not', 'single', 'shot', 'wasted', 'central', 'theme', 'progression', 'storyline', 'Truly', 'never', 'dull', 'moment', 'viewer', 'immediately', 'captivated', 'Peck', 'screen', 'presence.Alfred', 'Newman', 'score', 'very', 'thought', 'provoking', 'subtle', 'important', 'enhancement', 'central', 'theme', 'GUNFIGHTER', 'also', 'strong', 'cast', 'narrative', 'likes', 'Karl', 'Malden', 'Skip', 'Homeier', 'Richard', 'Jaeckel', 'Kenneth', 'Tobey', 'Ellen', 'Corby', 'Helen', 'Westcott', 'Alan', 'Hale', 'Jr']",N/A
269268,A2EOCDPEG6K1WQ,6301801733,Mark Lahren,"[16, 18]","This could be the best western I have ever seen. Mostly because of its noir elements and absolutely standout performances, especially by Gregory Peck as the haunted gunfighter trying to leave his past behind, and by Millard Mitchell as his old partner-in-crime-turned-sheriff. I knew immediately upon watching this for the first time tonight that this was not your typical western. It quietly conveys doom almost from the beginning. I sensed a bleak outlook for Peck's character, Jimmy Ringo, from the start, and the movie conveys this mood very subtly throughout, building to the inevitable conclusion in understated and graceful tones.That said, this movie has several very brief but very humorous moments that had me laughing outright because they caught me completely off guard. These humorous snippets will pass you by completely if you're not watching closely. And even if you are watching closely, they are so understated that you still could miss them. I'll give you a few of these scenes to watch for: When the old man comes in to talk to the sheriff (while the sheriff is talking to Ringo) to tell him someone set his house on fire (spot-on comedic timing by all concerned), when the kid who wants to gun down Ringo comes in for a haircut, makes boasts, then leaves. After he leaves, one of the men in the shop makes a comment (again, perfect timing). There's about three more that I noticed, but there could be more. As I said, it flies by so naturally, I'm guessing most people wouldn't notice it. Very subtle humor.But this film is a strange sort of tragedy first and foremost, and the noirish element is definitely prominent throughout. It's amazing to me that all the actors' performances are toned down so far that they hardly move at times, and yet these performances are some of the most powerful I've ever seen. Director Henry King should have gotten an award for creating this masterpiece of understatement. If you're a fan of westerns or noir, you can't go wrong.
