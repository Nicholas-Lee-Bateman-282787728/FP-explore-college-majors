1205074,AJDOJANK50QJV,B001J2XROY,D. McSherry,"[52, 58]","There were a few episodes of Season Five that REALLY took me back.  The days before paramedic engine companies, the days before EMT training was required for state firefighter certification, days before automated defibrilators were common practice, and of course the days before the cell phone.  If you came on the scene after 1990, please watch in particular these episodes:1)  The Stewardess - This was made in 1975, before airplanes had an AED on board (my old department got their first AED in 1991).  Roy and Johnny are returning to Los Angeles from Sacramento, and a man had a heart attack on the plane.  Roy and Johnny spend 30 minutes with this patient until landing and then on to Rampart (they are allowed to retrieve gear from the cargo hold).  Today, airliners have an AED on board (and better packed first aid kits).2) Equipment - This was made in 1976, before the advent of paramedic engine companies.  Paramedic Gage is overtiming as a firefighter at Station 8 (normal for a big city department) when he and Captain Stone (who had been a paramedic) are treating a construction worker who had a heart attack and have to wait 25 minutes for cardiac drugs and a defibrillator because the only available squad was across town.  Gage and Stone did their best with their brains and the equipment they had (as well as CPR), but the patient passed away.  Had that happened today, Stone and Gage would of had the right equipment much earlier.  REALLY makes you think - it hits home for a firefighter and an EMT or paramedic. I don't think any EMT or paramedic forgets the first patient they lost (I haven't - he was a 48 y/o male who died of a heart attack).3) There are a few episodes in the Season 5 set where Johnny and Roy are dispatched to meet the Coast Guard.  Today, the Coast Guard has their own EMT's and Paramedics.4) The Frequency episode in Season 3 was also a good one, and there was one episode where a Priority Dispatch System was discussed.  Priority Dispatch became reality down the road.Newbie's as well as old-timers can watch these episodes for the history of the Standard of Care in the mid-1970's.  Note the changes, and be thankful that your truck doesn't carry a 42 pound defibrillator, and you have EMT-first responders on fire trucks and police cruisers. Make sure you young guys thank these trailblazers for their perseverance, patients, and tenacity.

With four season sets out, things were looking good when season 3 was released.  Then came season 4 with most episodes looking like they were mastered from a 25 year-old VHS rental.When Universal successfully farmed out season 2 of Adam-12 to SHOUT! Factory, we all had hope that possibly Dragnet and Emergency! and other Webb projects would follow suit.  BUT, let us all have a bit of faith in the suits at Universal for a proper DVD release.  Perhaps the massive fire experienced at Universal Studios will guide the powers to be in releasing pristine remastered episodes of a classic TV treasure.UPDATE: 12.28.08According to good friend L.C., it looks like Universal has let us down again!  How Universal can move Adam 12 to SHOUT!

I even recognized the differences in the opening theme music as it changed from season to season, even as it changed subtly from Seasons 1 through 4.This is why it has been so disappointing that in this DVD set (as in the sets for the last two seasons) Universal has used prints that have had Season 6's open grafted onto each episode.Look, I admit it, I'm still a slobbering fan of this show and my mile-wide OCD streak is showing.  But I am grumbling heavily at the beginning of each episode to see and hear the wrong open.  My nostalgia buttons are not being properly pressed.All I can say is that at least next year, when they release the Season 6 set (I hope), at least the Season 6 open will be right for those episodes.",3,One small flaw keeps me from full nostalgic nirvana,1235347200,"02 23, 2009",2009,1041,"['admit', 'was', 'obsessed', 'show', '1970s', 'kidhood', 'watched', 'prime', 'time', 'starting', 'Season', '5', 'when', 'was', 'no', 'longer', 'past', 'bedtime', 'reruns', 'Drop', 'middle', 'episode', 'could', 'tell', 'procedures', 'equipment', 'paramedics', 'used', 'season', 'was', 'even', 'recognized', 'differences', 'opening', 'theme', 'music', 'changed', 'season', 'season', 'even', 'changed', 'subtly', 'Seasons', '1', '4.This', 'why', 'been', 'so', 'disappointing', 'DVD', 'set', 'sets', 'last', 'two', 'seasons', 'Universal', 'used', 'prints', 'have', 'had', 'Season', '6', 'open', 'grafted', 'episode.Look', 'admit', ""'m"", 'still', 'slobbering', 'fan', 'show', 'mile-wide', 'OCD', 'streak', 'showing', 'am', 'grumbling', 'heavily', 'beginning', 'episode', 'see', 'hear', 'wrong', 'open', 'nostalgia', 'buttons', 'are', 'not', 'being', 'properly', 'pressed.All', 'can', 'say', 'least', 'next', 'year', 'when', 'release', 'Season', '6', 'set', 'hope', 'least', 'Season', '6', 'open', 'will', 'be', 'right', 'episodes']",N/A

Not when it originally aired but in syndicated reruns, even though I was 5 when it first aired in 1972. I used to watch with my grandmother whenver I could, or by myself if we weren't around each other. She and I both agreed that ""Johnny was dreamy, crooked smile and all"".When I found that the series was going to be released on DVD, I just had to get it. I have, right now, the first 5 seasons. I'm anxiously waiting the release of Season 6 and the final season of 2-hour ""movies"". The show brings back lots of great childhood memories about me and the only grandmother I ever knew.I sit and watch the series now with my teenage daughters. They both comment on how ""cute Johnny and Roy are"" and I and my husband comment on all of the mistakes we can see in an episode.I've read other reviews that complain about the quality of the images, but people have to remember that this show, a pioneer in its day, was actually filmed not recorded like shows nowadays. You also have to consider how long ago the series aired. (30+ years ago).I own the ""Behind the Scenes"" guide book that tells a lot about the Paramedic Program, in its infancy, and how ""Emergency"" was instrumental in gaining the Paramedic Program public awareness. If anyone wants to read about the show and the Paramedic Program started in the early, early 70's, get the book, too.NOTE TO UNIVERSAL: Don't wait a year before releasing the next season.

So for Glenn and all you other E fans that were waiting , but knowing, Can't say we didn't try to plead with universal , they just either didn't care or they really lost the originals from the fire. At least they could have taken the Columbia House release of ""The Stewardess"" which was the only episode from season five that was released restored and put it on the dvd.And to add insult to injury they add the Adam 12 episode ""lost and found"" which is beautifully restored and looks great, they can do it for Adam 12 , but not for Emergency,after all the shouting we did is beyond me.",3,"Updated from my pre review, 3. 5 stars",1225324800,"10 30, 2008",2008,1356,"['watching', 'discs', '1-3', 'final', 'review', 'already', 'knew', 'episodes', 'would', 'have', 'season', 'six', 'openings', 'episodes', 'so', 'far', 'worse', 'picture', 'not', 'cleaned', 'up', 'worse', 'two', 'releases', 'seasons', '3', '4', 'So', 'why', 'ask', 'would', 'give', 'somewhat', 'higher', 'rating', '3', '4', 'was', 'season', 'first', 'saw', 'child', 'so', 'as', 'much', 'tried', 'not', 'release', 'could', ""n't"", 'help', 'rememering', 'how', 'fond', 'memories', 'episodes', 'were', 'time', 'took', 'fair', 'quality', 'surprise', 'next', 'dvd', 'releasewill', 'have', 'same', 'openings', 'season', 'si', 'oh', 'yeah', 'will', 'be', 'season', 'six', 'released', 'next', 'so', 'guess', 'wo', ""n't"", 'matter', 'now', 'bad', 'quality', 'Universal', 'restored', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'So', 'Glenn', 'other', 'E', 'fans', 'were', 'waiting', 'knowing', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'try', 'plead', 'universal', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'care', 'really', 'lost', 'originals', 'fire', 'least', 'could', 'have', 'taken', 'Columbia', 'House', 'release', 'Stewardess', 'was', 'only', 'episode', 'season', 'five', 'was', 'released', 'restored', 'put', 'dvd.And', 'add', 'insult', 'injury', 'add', 'Adam', '12', 'episode', 'lost', 'found', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'great', 'can', 'do', 'Adam', '12', 'not', 'Emergency', 'shouting', 'did']",N/A

Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller) and Joe Early (Bobby Troup) with assistance from Nurse Dixie McCall (the eternally alluring Julie London). The show maintains its balance of big action pieces and quietly intense drama in Season 5, broken only by occasional moments of low-wattage humor, usually courtesy of (or at the expense of) Gage.There's little time for subplots involving the character's personal lives beyond what occurs in the firehouse and hospital, and for series fans, that's a good thing--that only leaves room for more action. It's a world apart from current medical dramas, which seem to view each episode as a challenge to see how many story arcs can be crammed into its running time; viewers may find this uncluttered approach a refreshing dose of nostalgia or too simple for their tastes.Fans, however, will undoubtedly relish another opportunity to ride with Squad 51 again. This 5-disc set contains all 24 episodes of EMERGENCY's Fifth Season; image quality looks particularly rough in certain episodes. Extras are relegated to a 5th Season episode of Webb's cop show ADAM-12, which features cameos by some of the cast from EMERGENCY!With sirens blaring, EMERGENCY-Season 5 comes to DVD with all 24 gripping episodes! Reunite with heroic LA County paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) as they race to the scene of desperate citizens trapped in some of Los Angeles's most dire situations.One of the first shows to realistically portray the trials and tribulations of working as an EMT or in a hospital, this engaging series by Jack Webb whom is best known for his role as gritty police investigator(Sgt. Joe Friday) on DRAGNET; is loaded with all the suspense, humor and heart-tugging decisions that could only come from real-life drama.",4,LA County's Finest,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",2014,2519,"['Viewers', 'expecting', 'plenty', 'firefighting', 'medical', 'excitement', '1975-76', 'Season', 'set', 'Jack', 'Webb', ""'70s"", 'TV', 'drama', 'EMERGENCY', 'will', 'plenty', 'set.Unlike', 'many', 'television', 'series', 'passing', 'landmark', '5th', 'Season', 'EMERGENCY', 'implemented', 'significant', 'changes', 'either', 'characters', 'basic', 'arc', 'episode', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'County', 'firefighter/paramedics', 'Johnny', 'Gage', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'are', 'dispatched', 'rescue', 'ordinary', 'Southern', 'California', 'citizens', 'variety', 'accidents', 'disasters', 'ranging', 'gas', 'explosions', 'suicide', 'attempts', 'diet', 'pill', 'overdoses', 'accident', 'scams', 'gone', 'wrong.The', 'victims', 'are', 'then', 'raced', 'Rampart', 'General', 'Hospital', 'be', 'overseen', 'Drs', 'Kelly', 'Brackett', 'Robert', 'Fuller', 'Joe', 'Early', 'Bobby', 'Troup', 'assistance', 'Nurse', 'Dixie', 'McCall', 'eternally', 'alluring', 'Julie', 'London', 'show', 'balance', 'big', 'action', 'pieces', 'quietly', 'intense', 'drama', 'Season', '5', 'broken', 'only', 'occasional', 'moments', 'low-wattage', 'humor', 'usually', 'courtesy', 'expense', 'Gage.There', 'little', 'time', 'subplots', 'involving', 'character', 'personal', 'lives', 'what', 'firehouse', 'hospital', 'series', 'fans', 'good', 'thing', 'only', 'room', 'more', 'action', 'world', 'apart', 'current', 'medical', 'dramas', 'seem', 'view', 'episode', 'challenge', 'see', 'how', 'many', 'story', 'arcs', 'can', 'be', 'crammed', 'running', 'time', 'viewers', 'may', 'find', 'uncluttered', 'approach', 'refreshing', 'dose', 'nostalgia', 'too', 'simple', 'tastes.Fans', 'however', 'will', 'undoubtedly', 'relish', 'opportunity', 'ride', 'Squad', '51', 'again', '5-disc', 'set', '24', 'episodes', 'EMERGENCY', 'Fifth', 'Season', 'image', 'quality', 'particularly', 'rough', 'certain', 'episodes', 'Extras', 'are', 'relegated', '5th', 'Season', 'episode', 'Webb', 'cop', 'show', 'ADAM-12', 'cameos', 'cast', 'EMERGENCY', 'sirens', 'blaring', 'EMERGENCY-Season', '5', 'DVD', '24', 'gripping', 'episodes', 'Reunite', 'heroic', 'LA', 'County', 'paramedics', 'Roy', 'DeSoto', 'Kevin', 'Tighe', 'John', 'Gage', 'Randolph', 'Mantooth', 'race', 'scene', 'desperate', 'citizens', 'trapped', 'Los', 'Angeles', 'most', 'dire', 'situations.One', 'first', 'realistically', 'portray', 'trials', 'tribulations', 'working', 'EMT', 'hospital', 'engaging', 'series', 'Jack', 'Webb', 'whom', 'best', 'known', 'role', 'gritty', 'police', 'investigator', 'Sgt', 'Joe', 'Friday', 'DRAGNET', 'loaded', 'suspense', 'humor', 'heart-tugging', 'decisions', 'could', 'only', 'come', 'real-life', 'drama']",N/A
