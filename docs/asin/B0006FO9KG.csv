866733,AYPCUQS6ARWFH,B0006FO9KG,"Andre M. ""brnn64""","[6, 7]","I remember when this was in the works, some civil rights folks out in LA were already talking about boycotting and banning this.First of all, all that did (as it always does, will they ever learn?) was make people curious about it and check it out in droves on DVD (in the words of Rocky the Flying Squirrel, ""But that trick NEVER works!"").In either case, this movie is so wild and over the top that it is IMPOSSIBLE to take seriously. This is a bizzare (and admittedly imaginative) cartoon of a lonely white suburban kid who finds a father figure in a pimp named ""Fruit Juice"" (voiced expertly by Bernie Mac). The Mac and a prostitute voiced by Little Kim (again, perfect casting) teach the boy about the Pimp game and about life in general.There could be concerns that like ""Soul Plane,"" this would be nothing but trashy stereotypes. Perhaps, but it's a guilty pleasure with some really charming and funny moments. (The scene where the kid takes the Pimp and Little Kim to school for ""show and tell"" is a SCREAM!). Yeah, one could go on and on about stereotypes, the morality of a story involving children and pimping, etc. but unlike ""The Mack,""  ""American Pimp,"" ad nauseum, this film does not take itself seriosuly and is clearly just a comedy.Basically, leave your brains (and the kiddies) and all the analysis and sociology at the door for this one- get some of your buddies over for beer and pizza, and LAFF Your (posterior) OFF!BTW-It would help this DVD if they added some of the original web ""Lil Pimp"" cartoons as extra features, as was the case with the ""Undercover Brother"" DVD.",4,Fat Albert and the Flintstones it ain't,1120262400,"07 2, 2005",2005,1592,"['remember', 'when', 'was', 'works', 'civil', 'rights', 'folks', 'out', 'LA', 'were', 'already', 'talking', 'boycotting', 'banning', 'this.First', 'did', 'always', 'will', 'ever', 'learn', 'was', 'make', 'people', 'curious', 'check', 'out', 'droves', 'DVD', 'words', 'Rocky', 'Flying', 'Squirrel', 'trick', 'NEVER', '.In', 'case', 'movie', 'so', 'wild', 'top', 'IMPOSSIBLE', 'take', 'seriously', 'bizzare', 'admittedly', 'imaginative', 'cartoon', 'lonely', 'white', 'suburban', 'kid', 'who', 'father', 'figure', 'pimp', 'named', 'Fruit', 'Juice', 'voiced', 'expertly', 'Bernie', 'Mac', 'Mac', 'prostitute', 'voiced', 'Little', 'Kim', 'again', 'perfect', 'casting', 'teach', 'boy', 'Pimp', 'game', 'life', 'general.There', 'could', 'be', 'concerns', 'Soul', 'Plane', 'would', 'be', 'nothing', 'trashy', 'stereotypes', 'Perhaps', 'guilty', 'pleasure', 'really', 'charming', 'funny', 'moments', 'scene', 'where', 'kid', 'Pimp', 'Little', 'Kim', 'school', 'show', 'tell', 'SCREAM', 'Yeah', 'one', 'could', 'go', 'stereotypes', 'morality', 'story', 'involving', 'children', 'pimping', 'etc', 'Mack', 'American', 'Pimp', 'ad', 'nauseum', 'film', 'not', 'take', 'seriosuly', 'clearly', 'just', 'comedy.Basically', 'leave', 'brains', 'kiddies', 'analysis', 'sociology', 'door', 'one-', 'get', 'buddies', 'beer', 'pizza', 'LAFF', 'Your', 'posterior', 'BTW-It', 'would', 'help', 'DVD', 'added', 'original', 'web', 'Lil', 'Pimp', 'cartoons', 'extra', 'features', 'was', 'case', 'Undercover', 'Brother', 'DVD']",Lil' Pimp

866735,A138CCR74DFHF1,B0006FO9KG,Jequan Merle,"[0, 1]","Many of the better films nowadays are cartoons. In the mid 90s when Disney brought Hollywood back on track with the ""Lion King"" and ""Aladdin"", adult viewers claimed that these films were made for adults too. Unforunately, that became an excuse used by adults who didn't actually have adult cartoons readily available for their viewing pleasure.Yes, ""Lil Pimp"" has an adult themed plot. The plot wasn't really what it needed in order to go from being an average cartoon to a good animation. The movie actually needed to connect with the audience it was aimed for. The main charater in ""Lil Pimp"" is a young white child. Although the idea of a young white kid learning how to be a pimp seems funny, it wasn't in the film. For more laughable humor go watch ""Madagascar"". The viewing pleasure of the cartoon laid strictly in sexy cartoon figures.The truth is that this film was aimed at the wrong audience. The audience that this film should have been aimed at does not exist. We are talking about a cartoon that is to hard for kids and to soft for adults. The sad part of cartoon was the attempt to create touching family moments within the film. The reunion of mother and son........please. Of course this movie was going straight to video.",3,Straight to Vidaho,1135641600,"12 27, 2005",2005,1238,"['Many', 'better', 'films', 'nowadays', 'are', 'cartoons', 'mid', '90s', 'when', 'Disney', 'brought', 'Hollywood', 'back', 'track', 'Lion', 'King', 'Aladdin', 'adult', 'viewers', 'claimed', 'films', 'were', 'made', 'adults', 'too', 'Unforunately', 'became', 'excuse', 'used', 'adults', 'who', 'did', ""n't"", 'actually', 'have', 'adult', 'cartoons', 'readily', 'available', 'viewing', 'pleasure.Yes', 'Lil', 'Pimp', 'adult', 'themed', 'plot', 'plot', 'was', ""n't"", 'really', 'what', 'needed', 'order', 'go', 'being', 'average', 'cartoon', 'good', 'animation', 'movie', 'actually', 'needed', 'connect', 'audience', 'was', 'aimed', 'main', 'charater', 'Lil', 'Pimp', 'young', 'white', 'child', 'idea', 'young', 'white', 'kid', 'learning', 'how', 'be', 'pimp', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'film', 'more', 'laughable', 'humor', 'go', 'watch', 'Madagascar', 'viewing', 'pleasure', 'cartoon', 'laid', 'strictly', 'sexy', 'cartoon', 'figures.The', 'truth', 'film', 'was', 'aimed', 'wrong', 'audience', 'audience', 'film', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'aimed', 'not', 'exist', 'are', 'talking', 'cartoon', 'hard', 'kids', 'soft', 'adults', 'sad', 'part', 'cartoon', 'was', 'attempt', 'create', 'touching', 'family', 'moments', 'film', 'reunion', 'mother', 'son', '..please', 'course', 'movie', 'was', 'going', 'straight', 'video']",Lil' Pimp
