For those Fantasy Island fans who have been waiting for years for this series to be released on DVD I would recommend that you email Shout Factory and let them know that you're interested in seasons 3-7 so that they will release them soon in the future. Otherwise we might have to wait another 7 years or longer to get season 3 released.As for season 2 itself, I'm only 6 episodes in and I am greatly enjoying them. Some episodes I remember from being first run in the 70's and some that I don't remember that are new to me. I think that one of the reasons why I like this show so much is because every week anything would be possible, the show had endless possibilities.As for the DVD's themselves I don't think that they have closed caption and I know that they don't have a ""special features"" menu.

I ABSOLUTELY CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT FINALLY ANOTHER SEASON OF ""FANTASY ISLAND"" IS GOING TO BE RELEASED. I HAVE BEEN SO READY TO GET ON WITH MY COLLECTION OF NOT ONLY ""FANTASY ISLAND"", BUT ALSO ""THE LOVE BOAT"". BOY, THIS WAS MY SATURDAY NIGHT DATE. ME, ""THE LOVE BOAT"" AND ""FANTASY ISLAND"". I WOULD HURRY UP AND FINISH COOKING DINNER, FIX MY CHILDREN THEIR PLATE. PREPARE MY PLATE, THEN SITUATE MYSELF IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION. AND GO TO DREAM LAND FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS. IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. BY THE TIME I DISCOVERED ""FANTASY ISLAND"" IT HAD ALREADY BEEN ON FOR AT LEAST 2 OR THREE SEASONS. BOY, MR ROARKE AND TATTOO WORE THE WHITEST SUITS I HAVE EVER SEEN ON ANYBODY IN MY LIFE. AND THE FANTASIES THAT GUESTS WOULD ASK FOR WOULD RANGE FROM BIZARRE AND STRANGE TO DOWNRIGHT DANGEROUS. MR ROARKE WOULD FROWN WHEN ONE OF THE GUESTS WOULD ASK FOR THEIR MONEY BACK OR TRY TO CANCEL THEIR FANTASY. HE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT ONCE THEIR FANTASY STARTED THEY COULD NEITHER GET THEIR MONEY BACK OR GET OUT OF GOING THROUGH THEIR FANTASY. THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER LITERALLY PUT ANY OF HIS GUESTS IN DANGER, HE WOULD WARN THEM ABOUT THE PERILS OF THEIR FANTASY BEFORE IT WOULD START. AFTER THAT THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY LIKED ABOUT ""FANTASY ISLAND"" AND ""THE LOVE BOAT"" WAS THAT EVERY ACTOR AND ACTRESS OUT THERE APPEARED ON THOSE TWO SHOWS. AND THEY HAD SOME FANTASTIC SCRIPTS. THEY WERE MY STAPLE FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT ""THE LOVE BOAT"" BACK IN THE LATE 1990'S AND LATER, ""FANTASY ISLAND"", OR WAS IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, THEY DIDN'T WORK. I REALLY WISH THEY HAD.

In the first episode, Tattoo has become despondent; no one takes him seriously; everyone just takes him for granted.  There is some great, heart-felt dialogue between these two.
