279915,ABH4G7TVI6G2T,6301968891,Byron Kolln,"[1, 1]","Bette Davis and Mary Astor duel splendidly in the 1941 melodrama THE GREAT LIE, based on a book by Polan Banks.  Mild-mannered Maggie Van Allen (Davis) and flamboyant concert pianist Sandra Kovak (Astor) strike a desperate bargain when Maggie's husband Peter (George Brent)--who was also briefly married to Sandra--dies in an aeroplane accident.  But Maggie's deception comes back to haunt her when Peter makes a miraculous return from the grave...To some extent it's a re-tread of material that Davis had previously played in ""The Old Maid"", but THE GREAT LIE is notable for it's searing, Oscar-winning performance from Mary Astor as Sandra.  Davis had personally recommended Astor for the role, aware that she had in fact studied piano and could convincingly pull off the scenes in which Sandra performs her various concertos.  The one thing that Davis hated was Lenore Coffee's script (""It's soap opera drivel and it stinks in all departments!"" she complained); so she enlisted Astor's help in re-tooling some of the scenes between the two women.  Much of what they did on the screen was quite skillfully improvised, and the director Edmund Goulding was delighted with the resulting performances.Of course, rumours flew that Davis was increasingly jealous that Mary Astor was stealing the entire film away from her, but Astor demurred, instead saying ""She handed THE GREAT LIE to me on a silver platter"".  The movie showcases both ladies to their full advantage, and Davis never had a cause to worry.  Davis and Astor continued a friendship right up until Astor's death; indeed, Davis pulled Astor out of retirement to play a small but very important role in the 1964 thriller ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"".The DVD of THE GREAT LIE is only available as part of Warner's third Bette Davis boxset, which also boasts ""The Old Maid"", ""Watch on the Rhine"", ""All This, and Heaven Too"", ""Deception"" and ""In This Our Life"".",4,"""If I didn't think you meant so well, I'd feel like slapping your face""",1246060800,"06 27, 2009",2009,1919,"['Bette', 'Davis', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'duel', 'splendidly', '1941', 'melodrama', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'LIE', 'based', 'book', 'Polan', 'Banks', 'Mild-mannered', 'Maggie', 'Van', 'Allen', 'Davis', 'flamboyant', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Sandra', 'Kovak', 'Astor', 'strike', 'desperate', 'bargain', 'when', 'Maggie', 'husband', 'Peter', 'George', 'Brent', 'who', 'was', 'also', 'briefly', 'married', 'Sandra', 'aeroplane', 'accident', 'Maggie', 'deception', 'back', 'haunt', 'when', 'Peter', 'miraculous', 'return', 'grave', 'extent', 're-tread', 'material', 'Davis', 'had', 'previously', 'played', 'Old', 'Maid', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'LIE', 'notable', 'searing', 'Oscar-winning', 'performance', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Sandra', 'Davis', 'had', 'personally', 'recommended', 'Astor', 'role', 'aware', 'had', 'fact', 'studied', 'piano', 'could', 'convincingly', 'pull', 'off', 'scenes', 'Sandra', 'various', 'concertos', 'one', 'thing', 'Davis', 'hated', 'was', 'Lenore', 'Coffee', 'script', 'soap', 'opera', 'drivel', 'departments', 'complained', 'enlisted', 'Astor', 'help', 're-tooling', 'scenes', 'two', 'women', 'Much', 'what', 'did', 'screen', 'was', 'quite', 'skillfully', 'improvised', 'director', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'was', 'delighted', 'resulting', 'performances.Of', 'course', 'flew', 'Davis', 'was', 'increasingly', 'jealous', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'was', 'stealing', 'entire', 'film', 'away', 'Astor', 'demurred', 'instead', 'saying', 'handed', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'LIE', 'silver', 'platter', 'movie', 'ladies', 'full', 'advantage', 'Davis', 'never', 'had', 'cause', 'worry', 'Davis', 'Astor', 'continued', 'friendship', 'right', 'up', 'Astor', 'death', 'indeed', 'Davis', 'pulled', 'Astor', 'retirement', 'play', 'small', 'very', 'important', 'role', '1964', 'thriller', 'Hush', 'Hush', 'Sweet', 'Charlotte', '.The', 'DVD', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'LIE', 'only', 'available', 'part', 'Warner', 'third', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'boxset', 'also', 'Old', 'Maid', 'Watch', 'Rhine', 'Heaven', 'Too', 'Deception', 'Life']",Great Lie VHS

279918,A19U5RYULZ0Z72,6301968891,Douglas M,"[0, 4]","""The Great Lie"" is a second rate Bette Davis vehicle released in 1941 when she was at the height of her career. The merits of the film include:- a charming performance by a natural Davis with a particularly warm and convincing relationship with leading man George Brent with whom Davis had great personal rapport- a vibrant Oscar winning performance from a striking Mary Astor as Davis's rival- great production values, with lush photography, sets and musical score.The drawback, however, which almost sinks the film, is the sappy story which Davis and Astor tried to spice up with their own intervention on the script. The story simply is not worthy of the superlative treatment it is given.The DVD contains an excellent print and a comprehensive set of dull extras from the Warner Brothers vaults. The newsreel, minus soundtrack, shows candid shots of famous people at Ciro's, a popular LA nightclub. It is fairly dumb. There is a short film based on a Damon Runyan story, a neat little thriller about a thug reformed by an elderly lady. There are 2 more, one about polo, the other about horse racing. Warner's were masters at recycling their product and ""Polo with the Stars"" combines documentary with excerpts from ""The Little Giant"" starring Edward G Robinson and ""Polo Joe"" starring Joe E Brown. The cartoon is amusing as Porky Pig is bombarded by a dog looking for a home. Two trailers are included - for ""The Great Lie"" itself which clearly aims the film at the women in the audience and ""Strawberry Blonde"" a rollicking Jimmy Cagney nostalgia fest from the same year.The whole package is certainly comprehensive even if most of it is second rate.

279922,A1345VRK5MYG7,6301968891,James L.,"[7, 9]","George Brent is having a hard time managing the women in his life.  He spends years in love with Bette Davis, but she won't marry him because he isn't ready to settle down.  He marries fiery concert pianist Mary Astor, only to discover her divorce from her first husband isn't finalized.  When she won't bend to his will, he goes back to Davis and marries her, only to disappear in the Brazilian jungle, leaving behind a broken-hearted Davis and a pregnant Astor.  The story behind The Great Lie is, needless to say, a bit farfetched.  It relies a lot on the viewer suspending their disbelief.  What really keeps this film moving is the sparring between Davis and Astor.  I've always enjoyed and appreciated Mary Astor, and in this film she's given a character right up her alley.  She sinks into the roll, throwing out her lines with obvious relish and taking control of every scene she's in.  Davis is good in a quieter performance, letting Astor have the spotlight.  Brent is his usual self, and Hattie McDaniel is given more dialogue and character to work with than her standard maid role, and she is very strong.  The music is a bit overpowering and over the top, but then again, so is the whole scenario of the story.  The strength of this melodrama is Mary Astor in one of her best performances.

Watching the movie, one becomes gradually aware of how vast Maggie's farm is: it's so big that she claims there are whole rooms she's never seen.  In one scene she pulls a bellcord and it falls down from the ceiling, and she laughs. since this proves that it hasn't been used in a long, long time.  During a wedding scene you see Violet and Jefferson approach a large iced cake and carefully it outside into a whole from yard filled with jubilant black well-wishers, singing and harmonizing in gospel cadences.  Do they all work for Maggie?  There must be thirty or forty of them.  Maybe they're neighbors drawn to Maggie's farm for the festivities.  ""Nice music,"" speculates George Brent.  ""Yes,"" murmurs Bette Davis.  Later  it's revealed that Maggie's farm is twenty acres, but it seems enormous like San Simeon.  It's big enough for George Brent to use a side field as a runway for his plane.  I wonder what the point is to this slow buildup of Bette Davis as perhaps the richest woman in Maryland.  At first it seems she lives humbly, so we feel she's the underdog in her personal war against Mary Astor, who lives the wild, Lindsay Lohan playgirl lifestyle in a giant hotel suite in Manhattan.  It comes as a thunderbolt when Davis makes Astor an offer she can't financially refuse--until that moment, you'd never guess that Astor was suffering for money!The only way you might possibly guess is that Davis' exquisite clothes are a considerable notch above Mary Astor's.  Astor favors tight, tight, playgirl jumpsuits flecked with bugle beads and glitter, like an Easter basket.  For her big scene at the end, she wears what looks like a Mao jacket and pants from the early 1970s.  She doesn't look awful, it's just that her wardrobe looks like it cost about 50 cents.  Well, there's one beautiful gown she wears for her Philadelphia piano recital.  She's got a meaty, meaty role here and she does everything she can with it, considering she's often missing from the action the script dictates.  The script is pretty shallow, but it's a rare movie that concentrates on the rivalry, then the alliance, between two strong women, and their scenes together are grand.  Davis must have been tiny--I never realized that until watching The Great Lie.

When Sandra is faced with the choice of marrying him on the day the divorce is final or playing a concert, she makes a choice that leaves Peter free to marry Maggie.Shortly after their marriage, Peter, an experienced aviator and cartographer, is called away on a governmental mission. In the interim, Sandra tells Maggie that she is carrying Peter's child and vows to use that fact to get him back. Peter's plane, however, is reported missing over a remote area of the Amazon jungle, and he is presumed dead. This, of course, throws a monkey wrench into Sandra's plans, as she does not want the baby without Peter. Maggie, who is not pregnant and has no hope now of ever having a child by Peter, strikes a deal with Sandra that will allow Maggie to pass off Sandra's and Peter's baby, as if it were hers and Peter's. It is like making a pact with the devil, as Maggie will soon find out.This is an enormously entertaining film with great dialogue between the two protagonists, Sandra and Maggie. Ms. Astor does a decided star turn as the temperamental and  brilliant, world acclaimed concert pianist. Ms. Astor plays her as a diva of the first order, and she deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance. The role of Maggie, who is the good girl from the south, has its moments in the hands of such an accomplished actress as Ms. Davis. The dialogue between the two is always crisp and interesting. George Brent is perfectly cast in the role of Peter, a wealthy chap who is desired by two gloriously different women. Lucille Watson has a small part as Maggie's aunt, and Hattie McDaniel plays Maggie's ever present mammy. The film is topped of by the powerful music of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto.This is a film that lovers of classic melodramas will enjoy, as will lovers of classical music.",5,TWO DIVAS FOR THE PRICE OF ONE..AT THEIR MELODRAMATIC BEST..,1011484800,"01 20, 2002",2002,2529,"['1941', 'film', 'release', 'superlative', 'melodrama', 'classic', 'cast', 'stellar', 'ensemble', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'George', 'Brent', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'Lucille', 'Watson', 'up', 'screen', 'story', 'true', 'love', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'however', 'who', 'soaring', 'little', 'doubt', 'why', 'won', 'Oscar', 'Best', 'Supporting', 'Actress.Mary', 'Astor', 'role', 'Sandra', 'temperamental', 'concert', 'pianist', 'who', 'Peter', 'George', 'Brent', 'again', 'off', 'again', 'beau', 'Sandra', 'rival', 'Maggie', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'get', 'married', 'Peter', 'alcoholic', 'stupor', 'New', 'York', 'spending', 'night', 'together', 'out', 'marriage', 'was', 'not', 'legal', 'Sandra', 'divorce', 'first', 'husband', 'was', 'not', 'final', 'When', 'Sandra', 'faced', 'choice', 'marrying', 'day', 'divorce', 'final', 'playing', 'concert', 'choice', 'Peter', 'free', 'marry', 'Maggie.Shortly', 'marriage', 'Peter', 'experienced', 'aviator', 'cartographer', 'called', 'away', 'governmental', 'mission', 'interim', 'Sandra', 'Maggie', 'carrying', 'Peter', 'child', 'vows', 'use', 'fact', 'get', 'back', 'Peter', 'plane', 'however', 'reported', 'missing', 'remote', 'area', 'Amazon', 'jungle', 'presumed', 'dead', 'course', 'monkey', 'wrench', 'Sandra', 'plans', 'not', 'want', 'baby', 'Peter', 'Maggie', 'who', 'not', 'pregnant', 'hope', 'now', 'ever', 'having', 'child', 'Peter', 'deal', 'Sandra', 'will', 'allow', 'Maggie', 'pass', 'off', 'Sandra', 'Peter', 'baby', 'were', 'hers', 'Peter', 'making', 'pact', 'devil', 'Maggie', 'will', 'soon', 'find', 'out.This', 'enormously', 'entertaining', 'film', 'great', 'dialogue', 'two', 'protagonists', 'Sandra', 'Maggie', 'Ms.', 'Astor', 'decided', 'star', 'turn', 'temperamental', 'brilliant', 'world', 'acclaimed', 'concert', 'pianist', 'Ms.', 'Astor', 'diva', 'first', 'order', 'deservedly', 'won', 'Academy', 'Award', 'performance', 'role', 'Maggie', 'who', 'good', 'girl', 'south', 'moments', 'hands', 'such', 'accomplished', 'actress', 'Ms.', 'Davis', 'dialogue', 'two', 'always', 'crisp', 'interesting', 'George', 'Brent', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'role', 'Peter', 'wealthy', 'chap', 'who', 'desired', 'two', 'gloriously', 'different', 'women', 'Lucille', 'Watson', 'small', 'part', 'Maggie', 'aunt', 'Hattie', 'McDaniel', 'Maggie', 'ever', 'present', 'mammy', 'film', 'topped', 'powerful', 'music', 'Tchaikovsky', 'Piano', 'Concerto.This', 'film', 'lovers', 'classic', 'melodramas', 'will', 'enjoy', 'will', 'lovers', 'classical', 'music']",Great Lie VHS
279928,AAW58LG72PG7I,6301968891,"Martin Asiner ""Adjunct College Instructor""","[2, 2]","By the time Bette Davis made THE GREAT LIE in 1941, she had already established herself as one of Hollywood's most formidable actresses whose edgy style of dramatics made her the logical choice to play Maggie, a wealthy woman who passes off another woman's baby as her own.  The plot is pure melodrama, of course, but it is not for that which stamps this movie as a near great.  Once the audience gets past the logical improbabilities of the coincidences needed to make one scene lead to the next, what causes that audience to remain fixed on the unfolding events is the titanic clash between Bette Davis and Mary Astor (Sandra).  And caught in the middle is George Brent, who first marries Sandra (Astor), gets her pregnant, flies off to the Amazon, crashes his plane, and remains off screen for the middle part of the movie.  Brent is Pete the aviator who recreates his essential screen persona of blandness, which does not allow him to seriously challenge his leading ladies as the dramatic center.  He and Miss Davis had similar parts in DARK VICTORY where he merely acted as a celluloid echo chamber for Davis to vent steam.  Here, he does much the same, but this time he vacillates between Davis and Astor, both of whom see him as far more interesting than does the audience.It is the onscreen duel between Maggie and Sandra that keeps the audience thoroughly rooted in the seats.  From the moment that they agree to allow Maggie to raise Sandra's child as her own, the audience can sense Hollywood's Golden Rule # 1: any such agreement must wind up in catastrophe.  When Pete magically reappears in both their lives, Maggie and Sandra trade sarcasms and catty remarks.  But lurking beneath this all is the fear that both share--that they will lose both man and child that they thought they had, then could lose. Mary Astor plays Sandra first as a chronic drunk then as one who is fiercely determined to claim her own.  Miss Davis had the more difficult task of portraying Maggie as one who walks a fine line between being equally determined but not coming off as a heartless schemer.  By the time the film ends, director Edmund Goulding presents a too pat ending that suggests that one of the female leads can overcome her ego to enter the realm of magnanimity.  Yet, it is the slow growth of personal vision of both women that permits audiences to remain entranced even decades later as to who will give in first.  Few films exhibit such relentless probing of female primordial urgings as well as this one and that is why I call THE GREAT LIE a near great film.",4,Clash of the Titans: Davis vs Astor,1210464000,"05 11, 2008",2008,2569,"['time', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'made', 'THE', 'GREAT', 'LIE', '1941', 'had', 'already', 'established', 'one', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'formidable', 'actresses', 'edgy', 'style', 'dramatics', 'made', 'logical', 'choice', 'play', 'Maggie', 'wealthy', 'woman', 'who', 'woman', 'baby', 'own', 'plot', 'pure', 'melodrama', 'course', 'not', 'stamps', 'movie', 'near', 'great', 'audience', 'logical', 'improbabilities', 'coincidences', 'needed', 'make', 'one', 'scene', 'lead', 'next', 'what', 'audience', 'remain', 'fixed', 'unfolding', 'events', 'titanic', 'clash', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Sandra', 'caught', 'middle', 'George', 'Brent', 'who', 'first', 'marries', 'Sandra', 'Astor', 'pregnant', 'Amazon', 'plane', 'off', 'screen', 'middle', 'part', 'movie', 'Brent', 'Pete', 'aviator', 'who', 'essential', 'screen', 'persona', 'blandness', 'not', 'allow', 'seriously', 'challenge', 'leading', 'ladies', 'dramatic', 'center', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'had', 'similar', 'parts', 'DARK', 'VICTORY', 'where', 'merely', 'acted', 'celluloid', 'echo', 'chamber', 'Davis', 'vent', 'steam', 'Here', 'much', 'same', 'time', 'Davis', 'Astor', 'whom', 'see', 'far', 'more', 'interesting', 'audience.It', 'onscreen', 'duel', 'Maggie', 'Sandra', 'audience', 'thoroughly', 'rooted', 'seats', 'moment', 'agree', 'allow', 'Maggie', 'raise', 'Sandra', 'child', 'own', 'audience', 'can', 'sense', 'Hollywood', 'Golden', 'Rule', '1', 'such', 'agreement', 'must', 'wind', 'up', 'catastrophe', 'When', 'Pete', 'magically', 'lives', 'Maggie', 'Sandra', 'trade', 'sarcasms', 'catty', 'remarks', 'lurking', 'beneath', 'fear', 'share', 'will', 'lose', 'man', 'child', 'thought', 'had', 'then', 'could', 'lose', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'Sandra', 'first', 'chronic', 'drunk', 'then', 'one', 'who', 'fiercely', 'determined', 'claim', 'own', 'Miss', 'Davis', 'had', 'more', 'difficult', 'task', 'portraying', 'Maggie', 'one', 'who', 'fine', 'line', 'being', 'equally', 'determined', 'not', 'coming', 'off', 'heartless', 'schemer', 'time', 'film', 'director', 'Edmund', 'Goulding', 'too', 'pat', 'ending', 'one', 'female', 'leads', 'can', 'overcome', 'ego', 'enter', 'realm', 'magnanimity', 'slow', 'growth', 'personal', 'vision', 'women', 'audiences', 'remain', 'entranced', 'even', 'decades', 'later', 'who', 'will', 'give', 'first', 'Few', 'films', 'exhibit', 'such', 'relentless', 'probing', 'female', 'primordial', 'urgings', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'why', 'call', 'GREAT', 'LIE', 'near', 'great', 'film']",Great Lie VHS
279929,A1FG91CM8221X1,6301968891,Miles D. Moore,"[3, 5]","Judging from the other reviews--all of them laudatory--I know I'm cruising for a bruising for what I'm about to write. But my honest opinion is that Edmund Goulding's ""The Great Lie"" has dated dreadfully in the seven decades since its release, far more so than most films of its era.I expected to at least like this movie, because I love both Bette Davis and Mary Astor. (Astor's performance--for which she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar--is to my mind the only good reason to see the film today.) But the various plot developments in ""The Great Lie"" struck me as neither believable nor interesting. Davis was never at her best when she portrayed undilutedly noble characters, and her supposedly noble Maggie Van Allen was to my mind insufferable. Similarly, George Brent--surely one of the dullest leading men ever--struck me as the opposite of desirable. Only Astor's selfish, hysterical Sandra Kovack--a concert pianist with infinite talent for music but none at all for life or love--came fully to life for me.As for the way African-Americans are portrayed in this movie, I will be kind and say merely that ""The Great Lie"" makes ""Gone with the Wind"" look enlightened. Hattie McDaniel's presence makes the comparison inevitable, and ""The Great Lie"" only increases my sympathy for a fine actress who was a victim of her times.This DVD includes a ""Warner's Night Out at the Movies"" feature that includes various short subjects which might have accompanied ""The Great Lie"" when it was first released. The short subjects include a short B-grade crime drama, ""At the Stroke of Twelve,"" which I actually found more interesting than ""The Great Lie."" They also include the first-ever Looney Tunes cartoon that I actually found depressing.

The film is very interesting as it provides a strong role for another female, in this case the marvellous Mary Astor. The film develops into an emotional tug of war between these two strong women, first over the George Brent character and then Astor's son. Bette Davis in a refreshing  change in pace plays the  nice girl while Mary Astor has a field day in the role of the selfish concert pianist for which she rightly won the academy award that year as best supporting actress. I always enjoy Astor's film acting from ""Midnight"" to ""The Maltese Falcon"" to ""Meet Me in St Louis"" She was a superb actress who had a rather disjointed film career ranging from playing femme fatales to loving mothers. In ""The Great Lie"" she has never been better and more than holds her own up against Bette Davis in the acting honours. One would have thought there would be fireworks on the set of this production as there was between Bette and Miriam Hopkins during production of the superb ""The Old Maid"" but no the two got on very well together, worked beautifully together and Mary Astor ever after spoke highly of Davis's care towards her during production and publicly thanked her during her Oscar acceptance speech for her help during production of ""The Great Lie""The production itself shows all the care that went into a Bette Davis production during the 40's. The supporting cast from the Warner Bros stable namely George Brent is excellent as always. With superb actresses like Lucile Watson and the wonderful Hattie Mcdaniel (who has some really beautiful dialogue in the scenes after Davis ""adapts"" Astor's baby ) how could the production go wrong? The musical score is also one of the best of the early forties as well.Soap Opera it may be but done with such finesse that the whole viewing is an engrossing experience. There are a number of amusing scenes included as well like the scene of Bette ""pacing"" up and done like an expectant father while Astor goes into labour which at the time was viewed as being ""too Lesbian""!!! Also worth mentioning is Astor's ""mad"" scene as she gets fed up with living in the desert with Davis..it's a riot and her scream sounds like something out of ""Whatever happened to Baby Jane""!! It's such a hootI recommend this great film strongly, firstly as a great showcase for two fine actresses working superbly off each other and secondly as a great example of Hollywood production and the excellent care that went into these films in the Golden era of Hollywood",4,Excellent film with great performances from Davis and Astor,1018483200,"04 11, 2002",2002,2605,"['one', 'long', 'run', 'film', 'successes', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'enjoyed', 'golden', 'period', 'Warners', 'Early', '40', 'film', 'very', 'interesting', 'strong', 'role', 'female', 'case', 'marvellous', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'film', 'emotional', 'tug', 'war', 'two', 'strong', 'women', 'first', 'George', 'Brent', 'character', 'then', 'Astor', 'son', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'refreshing', 'change', 'pace', 'nice', 'girl', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'field', 'day', 'role', 'selfish', 'concert', 'pianist', 'rightly', 'won', 'academy', 'award', 'year', 'best', 'supporting', 'actress', 'always', 'enjoy', 'Astor', 'film', 'acting', 'Midnight', 'Maltese', 'Falcon', 'Meet', 'Me', 'St', 'Louis', 'was', 'superb', 'actress', 'who', 'had', 'rather', 'disjointed', 'film', 'career', 'ranging', 'playing', 'femme', 'fatales', 'loving', 'mothers', 'Great', 'Lie', 'never', 'been', 'better', 'more', 'own', 'up', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'acting', 'honours', 'One', 'would', 'have', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'fireworks', 'set', 'production', 'was', 'Bette', 'Miriam', 'Hopkins', 'production', 'superb', 'Old', 'Maid', 'two', 'got', 'very', 'well', 'together', 'worked', 'beautifully', 'together', 'Mary', 'Astor', 'ever', 'spoke', 'highly', 'Davis', 'care', 'production', 'publicly', 'thanked', 'Oscar', 'acceptance', 'speech', 'help', 'production', 'Great', 'Lie', 'production', 'care', 'went', 'Bette', 'Davis', 'production', '40', 'supporting', 'cast', 'Warner', 'Bros', 'stable', 'namely', 'George', 'Brent', 'excellent', 'always', 'superb', 'actresses', 'Lucile', 'Watson', 'wonderful', 'Hattie', 'Mcdaniel', 'who', 'really', 'beautiful', 'dialogue', 'scenes', 'Davis', 'adapts', 'Astor', 'baby', 'how', 'could', 'production', 'go', 'wrong', 'musical', 'score', 'also', 'one', 'best', 'early', 'forties', 'well.Soap', 'may', 'be', 'done', 'such', 'finesse', 'whole', 'viewing', 'engrossing', 'experience', 'are', 'number', 'amusing', 'scenes', 'included', 'as', 'well', 'scene', 'Bette', 'pacing', 'up', 'done', 'expectant', 'father', 'Astor', 'labour', 'time', 'was', 'viewed', 'being', 'too', 'Lesbian', 'Also', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'Astor', 'mad', 'scene', 'fed', 'up', 'living', 'desert', 'Davis..it', 'riot', 'scream', 'something', 'happened', 'Baby', 'Jane', 'such', 'hootI', 'recommend', 'great', 'film', 'strongly', 'firstly', 'great', 'showcase', 'two', 'fine', 'actresses', 'working', 'superbly', 'other', 'secondly', 'great', 'example', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'excellent', 'care', 'went', 'films', 'Golden', 'era', 'Hollywood']",Great Lie VHS

She and George Brent always seemed to make magic on film and a chemistry that is so intense the audience can't help but feel, and they didn't fail us with ""The Great Lie"". Bette Davis and fellow star Mary Astor work off of each other in a glorious way and keep you enjoying both characters and wanting to see ""just how much can you rely on a promise from a woman who loves the same man you do"". They make you laugh, they make you cry, they make you furious...they are AMAZING in this film.As a side note, Mary Astor respected Bette Davis' work so much, when they made ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", even though Astor had a rather small (but very important) part in the movie and not even a scene together with Davis, she wanted Davis on the set because she respected her opinion so much!

The movie as originally written was ""lousy"" in Davis and Astor's words and both worked on the screenplay without credit. Davis is the good girl and Astor the bad. She was the more interesting role. Many say she stole the film which Astor refuted in her memoirs--the formitable Davis let her have the movie and a good thing. As brilliant as Astor always is, this is her finest performance and her Oscar was well-deserved. She's a tempermental concert pianist (and an accomplished one in her on right), round-heeled, spoiled, childish and perfectly wonderful. The sarcastic jabs between the two stars raise this above the suds to Grade A soap. A fine tearjerker. The plot has been reviewed and Astor who was always at her best doing character work cannot be equalled--this role would have been perfect for Davis but she would not have been as effective. Astor who later was typecast as the perfect mother, did not renew her lucrative MGM contract after spending years in this role which she so perfectly created as Judy Garland's mother in the classic ""Meet Me In St. Louis"" and by 1949 after playing ""Marmee"" in the sluggish remake of ""Little Women"" she left films for stage and television work appearing in movies too infrequently and usually as an overly doting mother. She was known in Hollywood when it came to casting ""Get me a Mary Astor type"", ""We need a Mary Astor"" and ""Who is Mary Astor?"". Fame knows no bounds. She later became a successful writer of two autobiographies including on her famous relationship with George S. Kauffman, her alcholism and her famous ""Purple Diary"" that the courts finally burned in 1952. She led a colorful life and her last cameo in 1965's ""Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte"" reunited her with friend and admirer Davis (although they did not share any scenes together), Davis on Astor's first day of work, told everyone to be be quiet and learn from a professional at work.This is a fine movie worthy of preservation.
