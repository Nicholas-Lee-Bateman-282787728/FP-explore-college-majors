But let's examine this carefully.  This movie centers on Paulie, a teenage girl who has been alone and unloved for most of her life.  She has her first dizzyingly exhilarating taste of love (forbidden at that) and then is cruelly broken up with.  Not to mention the girl has serious emotional issues to being with.So, it's only natural she's going to turn moody, passive-aggressive, and, being the teenage romantic she is, start moping around the forest spouting poetry.  This is what romantic, distraught kids do.  In that way, I think it's an excellent portrayal.I'd also like to point out that during another movie about boarding school, Dead Poets Society, when all of the snobby prep school boys starting getting pretentious and spouting poetry they knew *nothing* about, everybody gushes all over that film.

675836,A1LMBOI3T91P87,B00005QW5T,Allan M. Lees,"[8, 11]","Lost and delirious is the joking phrase that one of the protagonists uses to describe life in a Canadian girls' boarding school, and the description becomes all too true as the story unfolds.  While the script itself is only a B+ effort, the direction and acting is A++ with a strong cast all the way down to minor supporting characters.  Above all, Piper Perabo steals the movie as Paulie, carrying off a difficult role with facility and conviction.This is a movie about love and the loss of love, centering around a triumvirate comprising one new girl and two who have been at the school for some extended time.  All three girls are to differing degrees adrift emotionally, lacking the firm anchor of unconditional love that parents are supposed to provide.  Another joking phrase, ""the lost girls"" comes to describe Paulie perfectly as she descends into despair after being rejected by the only love-object she has ever known in her life: her friend and lover Tori.  Lacking the emotional safety-net of a family or even other close friends, Pauli is devastated when Tori abandons their relationship in order to protect her public image as a good little bourgeois father's girl.  The delicate balancing-act of the movie is to allow us to feel the full force of Paulie's emotional collapse while also understanding - if not entirely sympathizing with - the motives that drive Tori as she repudiates her one true love in order to save her own future.Although the lovers are both female, this is not a lesbian movie (whatever that means).  Although there are a couple of love scenes, this is not a soft-porn movie.  Although Paulie is cruelly isolated by the nervous homophobia of many of the other schoolgirls, this is not a movie about sexual politics.  Transiently fashionable notions of ""correctness"" fortunately have no place in this movie, which is about personal feelings.  Love, loyalty, desperation, fear, embarrassment, weakness all play their parts and we follow with foreboding and infinite sympathy Paulie's descent into total despair.  In order to appreciate a movie like this, it is probably necessary to have lived, loved, and lost, and to have thought deeply about the experience(s) afterwards.  So this is not an easy movie to watch, but for the emotionally mature viewer it is poignant and ultimately deeply moving, and represents a triumph of directing and acting quite absent from the vast majority of insipid confections that pass for ""great movies"" in North America.",4,A Must-See Movie For Anyone With Sensibility,1152835200,"07 14, 2006",2006,2488,"['Lost', 'delirious', 'joking', 'phrase', 'one', 'protagonists', 'describe', 'life', 'Canadian', 'girls', 'boarding', 'school', 'description', 'too', 'true', 'story', 'unfolds', 'script', 'only', 'B+', 'effort', 'direction', 'acting', 'A++', 'strong', 'cast', 'way', 'minor', 'supporting', 'characters', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'movie', 'Paulie', 'carrying', 'off', 'difficult', 'role', 'facility', 'conviction.This', 'movie', 'love', 'loss', 'love', 'centering', 'triumvirate', 'comprising', 'one', 'new', 'girl', 'two', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'school', 'extended', 'time', 'three', 'girls', 'are', 'differing', 'degrees', 'adrift', 'emotionally', 'lacking', 'firm', 'anchor', 'unconditional', 'love', 'parents', 'are', 'supposed', 'provide', 'joking', 'phrase', 'lost', 'girls', 'describe', 'Paulie', 'perfectly', 'despair', 'being', 'rejected', 'only', 'love-object', 'ever', 'known', 'life', 'friend', 'lover', 'Tori', 'Lacking', 'emotional', 'safety-net', 'family', 'even', 'other', 'close', 'friends', 'Pauli', 'devastated', 'when', 'Tori', 'relationship', 'order', 'protect', 'public', 'image', 'good', 'little', 'bourgeois', 'father', 'girl', 'delicate', 'balancing-act', 'movie', 'allow', 'feel', 'full', 'force', 'Paulie', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'also', 'understanding', 'not', 'entirely', 'sympathizing', 'motives', 'drive', 'Tori', 'one', 'true', 'love', 'order', 'save', 'own', 'future.Although', 'lovers', 'are', 'female', 'not', 'lesbian', 'movie', 'are', 'couple', 'love', 'scenes', 'not', 'soft-porn', 'movie', 'Paulie', 'cruelly', 'isolated', 'nervous', 'homophobia', 'many', 'other', 'schoolgirls', 'not', 'movie', 'sexual', 'politics', 'Transiently', 'fashionable', 'notions', 'correctness', 'fortunately', 'have', 'place', 'movie', 'personal', 'feelings', 'Love', 'loyalty', 'desperation', 'fear', 'embarrassment', 'weakness', 'play', 'parts', 'follow', 'foreboding', 'infinite', 'sympathy', 'Paulie', 'descent', 'total', 'despair', 'order', 'appreciate', 'movie', 'probably', 'necessary', 'have', 'lived', 'loved', 'lost', 'have', 'thought', 'deeply', 'experience', 's', 'afterwards', 'not', 'easy', 'movie', 'watch', 'emotionally', 'mature', 'viewer', 'poignant', 'ultimately', 'deeply', 'moving', 'triumph', 'directing', 'acting', 'quite', 'absent', 'vast', 'majority', 'insipid', 'confections', 'pass', 'great', 'movies', 'North', 'America']",N/A

675838,AD84ZN1ZQBSSH,B00005QW5T,Angie,"[16, 18]","This film arrived too late for the young women growing up in the 60s, 70s and maybe even 80s who felt alone and freakish in a world that had no room for gays or lesbians. Of course, I can't speak for them myself, but I can imagine how it must have been, how it still is sometimes. Any films made during those years would have only reinforced horrific, negative stereotypes about lesbians (think ""The Children's Hour"" without the surprising tinge of sympathy).""Lost and Delirious"" is certainly not the first film of the 21st century to come along and portray same gender love in a less than monstrous light, but is one of the most easily accessible and less preachy ones. It could be about anyone who has ever been a misfit and fallen in love against everyone else's wishes.Different people will bring their own history to this tale, but for many it is all too realistic. Even if you gently push the love story aspects aside, the portrayal of life in an all-girls' school is so accurate it almost hurts to watch. It's a sad part of life that many girls are cruel to each other during the teen years, but throw in the fact that two classmates who happen to be of the same sex fall in love with each other and suddenly hearts are being thrown in the meshing machine.I swore I wouldn't cry while I watched this, I swore, but Piper Perabo is just too good and too convincing as a young woman torn apart inside by her own feelings. Her vulnerability and the way her classmates (most of all the girl she loves) treat her lead to an intense breaking point that would leave the coldest person in the world in tears.

675841,A3R4TS03ITT2JC,B00005QW5T,Bob Thompson,"[9, 34]","I am into art films. I try as much as possible to avoid using such generalizing terms because it is very apparent to me that a great deal of what is out there on the indie scene really is not art at all. However, in recent years studios have sunk to new lows. Now more than ever major studios are pandering to the teen market with incredibly mediocre comedies that need only to include a scene of someone farting to gross 100 million. That said, it is easy to see how anyone who cares about film as an art form rather than just frivilous entertainment will seek stuff elsewhere.This has given rise to the &quot;indie scene.&quot; It is exactly because indie movies tackle tough subjects and are essentially the antithesis of big Hollywood productions that they deserve seriosu attention. In the last year alone, most of my favorites were &quot;indie&quot; films. Amelie, Ghost World, Reykjavik 101, The Crimson Rivers, The Widow of St. Pierre are all examples of the genre doing what it does best, producing intelligent, thought provoking and still entertaining films.Unfortunately though for every genre there are going to be a number of dismal filsm. I can say without any hesitation that &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot; is one of the worst films in recent memory. (The Center of the World gets second prize). I don't like to make swift judgements but I honestly believe that anyone who likes this film is an idiot. Not only is it cliched (that ridiculous gardener) and dull, but it is completely bereft of any kind of artistic ingenuity.It was obviously made by some mindless feminist. Every time the film seemed to run out of gas (every three minutes) somebody would have to break down and cry while some Sarah McHlachlan hybrid girl group would be piped in.I could rant and rave about this awfulness for days but I'd rather not.

All three leads are excellent, and the love between Tori and Pauli is palatable and convincing.  The story has enormous possibilities: lost love and a friendship triangle in the setting of a girl's boarding school.  But on a number of points it fails to deliver.The first is our narrator.  Mouse's monologues, a combination of naval gazing naivete and self-pity, slow the movie to a crawl everytime she appears on screen.  We are supposed to see the lovers through her eyes, but Mouse is such a wan icicle that her presence simply creates an emotional distance between the love story and the audience.  I could not help feeling that the story would have been more interesting told through from the perspective of one of the lovers themselves.The second is the turn in the plot where Tori and Pauli's relationship is discovered, a plot twist better suited to a 1960s setting than the year 2000.  Tori's reaction and subsequent actions are hard to swallow (if she was so concerned, why did she make out with Pauli on their roof for anyone to see, anyway?). Pauli's denial that the two are gay also seems dated.  (You can't help but wonder what bubble these girls have been living in, to have missed the last 30 years of gay liberation.

Even if I found out a 13-year-old girl wrote it, I'd still be disappointed.From pretentious qoutings of Shakespeare to the pointless obsession with a peregrine falcon (the lines about Perabo being ''the Raptor!'' are so bad you'll cringe), this movie is one long argument for using the mute button. The ''sex'' scene will please some teenage softcore/cinemax fans (I'm guessing), but then there's the obligatory ''lilting lesbian love song'' in the background.There's also the equally predictable Ani ''did I mention I do it with girls?'' Difranco ballad as backing for the ''devastating break-up''.

675862,A3C5ZZQ143WG6T,B00005QW5T,Jenifer M,"[7, 11]","This film is absolutely delightful and one of my favorites.  It has some of the best love scenes featuring two women that I've ever enjoyed.  Piper Perabo (Polly) is the more aggressive of the pair, and Jessica Pare (Victoria), with her enchanting deep set eyes and her enrapturing [...] (shown in silhouette during their after-hours trysts), is the essence of loveliness.  The story is told through the eyes of Misha Barton (Mary), their roommate, who is innocent and non-judgmental.The first half of the movie is like a fairy tale come true as the girls give to one another completely.  But after being discovered by her sister, Victoria tries to downplay the significance of the relationship - and instead switches her attention to boys.  Polly, however, is not so quick to let go - and she goes down swinging, which gives the movie a predictably tragic (lesbian movie) ending.On another level, though, this film contrasts two very different types of woman-to-woman relationships; one that is bisexual and enjoyed by girls before they discover boys; and another that is lesbian which leads to a very different place.  For me, this movie's message is that girls can find a measure of happiness with each other - so long as they take the former path.  And that the latter route is always more treacherous.Making love to another woman today immediately earns one the title of `lesbian.'  But, as Victoria's character attempts to demonstrate, girls being affectionate with one another can be a charming and naturally reassuring step towards achieving maturity, and that it needn't lead one to loving women exclusively (which, from my own experiences, I already knew to be true).I'm just thrilled that a movie as utterly enchanting as `Lost and Delirious' is the one serving up this alternative reality for women - to everyone.

Every few years a film comes along that really moves me, and that I can't get out of my head. Well I think for this year and always this is the film. It really pulled/pulls on my heart strings.The two lead performances of Piper Perabo and Jessica Pare has really mesmerised me totally. In the beginning before these two characters of Paulie and Tori are discovered, it is really beautiful to watch these two in love, and just going along there business until all hell breaks loose. The emotion, connection and love these two feel and share feels so real and honest.And the love scene between the two is very tender and real.Once they are revealed and Paulie's world begins to fall apart is so hard to watch at times, because I SO desperatly want  Paulie and Tori to figure it all out and be together as it once was.Like I've said this film has and always will leave a lasting impression on me, at times it's hard to get scenes of it out of my head. The raw emotion of Paulie so so excellently played by Piper Perabo, I've seen who I now consider from this performances, one of the most talentled actress' around. I hope she has a long lasting career.Jessica Pare, I am amazed at too. Her performance of being torn for her true love for Paulie but desperatly not wanting the world and her parents to know her real feelings.This is what is heartbreaking to watch, Tori pretending to be what her parents/family,society think/believe how she should be. ie. A hetrosexual girl, so she starts to date a boy that is interested in her, and this also contributes to Paulies melt down. This is when the film can be haunting, especially if you are so into the story and these two characters.Also let's not forget Mischa Barton. Mischa gives a well done performance as there witness througout the film.I absolutely recommend this movie for a number of reasons. One it isn't some dyke movie, this shows a natural, beautiful, honest look at two girls in love and the tragedy  I believe at what happens when they are found out and how one partner can clam up and not reveal how they really feel for fear of what their parents and everybody will think about them, and the destruction one will go through, cause they are so in love that it is  killing them.It really is an important film to watch and it gives one something to think about.",5,"MOVING, BRAVE, TOUCHING, LONGING, FANTASTIC",1116720000,"05 22, 2005",2005,2399,"['just', 'recently', 'saw', 'movie', 'first', 'time', 'blown', 'mind', 'Every', 'few', 'years', 'film', 'really', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'head', 'Well', 'think', 'year', 'always', 'film', 'really', 'heart', 'two', 'lead', 'performances', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'really', 'mesmerised', 'totally', 'beginning', 'two', 'characters', 'Paulie', 'Tori', 'are', 'discovered', 'really', 'beautiful', 'watch', 'two', 'love', 'just', 'going', 'along', 'there', 'business', 'hell', 'breaks', 'loose', 'emotion', 'connection', 'love', 'two', 'feel', 'share', 'feels', 'so', 'real', 'love', 'scene', 'two', 'very', 'tender', 'real.Once', 'are', 'revealed', 'Paulie', 'world', 'fall', 'apart', 'so', 'hard', 'watch', 'times', 'SO', 'desperatly', 'want', 'Paulie', 'Tori', 'figure', 'out', 'be', 'together', ""'ve"", 'said', 'film', 'always', 'will', 'leave', 'lasting', 'impression', 'times', 'hard', 'get', 'scenes', 'head', 'raw', 'emotion', 'Paulie', 'so', 'so', 'excellently', 'played', 'Piper', 'Perabo', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'who', 'now', 'consider', 'performances', 'one', 'most', 'talentled', 'actress', 'hope', 'long', 'lasting', 'career.Jessica', 'Pare', 'am', 'amazed', 'too', 'performance', 'being', 'torn', 'true', 'love', 'Paulie', 'desperatly', 'not', 'wanting', 'world', 'parents', 'know', 'real', 'feelings.This', 'what', 'heartbreaking', 'watch', 'Tori', 'pretending', 'be', 'what', 'parents/family', 'society', 'think/believe', 'how', 'should', 'be', 'ie', 'hetrosexual', 'girl', 'date', 'boy', 'interested', 'also', 'Paulies', 'melt', 'down', 'when', 'film', 'can', 'be', 'haunting', 'especially', 'are', 'so', 'story', 'two', 'characters.Also', 'let', 'not', 'forget', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Mischa', 'well', 'done', 'performance', 'witness', 'film.I', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'movie', 'number', 'reasons', 'One', ""n't"", 'dyke', 'movie', 'natural', 'beautiful', 'honest', 'look', 'two', 'girls', 'love', 'tragedy', 'believe', 'what', 'when', 'are', 'found', 'how', 'one', 'partner', 'can', 'clam', 'up', 'not', 'reveal', 'how', 'really', 'feel', 'fear', 'what', 'parents', 'everybody', 'will', 'think', 'destruction', 'one', 'will', 'go', 'cause', 'are', 'so', 'love', 'killing', 'them.It', 'really', 'important', 'film', 'watch', 'one', 'something', 'think']",N/A

We have 2 moderately attractive aged 20-plus lead actresses (Perabo and Pare) and Mischa Barton, also attractive and about the right age, playing 16-year old prep school girls.Although the 2 older girls are regularly having sex and essentially profess their undying love for each other - I believe the definition of lesbianism - one of them denies it after they are surprised in bed by her younger sister. ""Don't tell Mom and Dad"" and ""I'm not a lesbian"", and all that other hokey dialog, etc. She could have just said ""So, what?"", but then we'd have no movie.This leads to the predictable ""hurt feelings"" and resulting emotional plot-point between the two now-former lovers. And, we are given everyone's impression of what love ""is"". Yech.We have an abundance - really, really too much - of ""shakespearean"" quotes and dialog throughout the movie, which I suppose is intended to provide some weight to it.  We have ""symbolic"" songs, a ""symbolic"" hawk or eagle - sorry it's a ""raptor"" in the movie and even so-designated in the credits - and some (""symbolic""?) scenes of fencing. Most of it made me cringe.I'm a moderate Mischa fan - I've seen her in other movies - all weird ones...so I suppose I should not be surprised that ""Lost and Delirious"" is no real winner.

But in fact, this little gem had a lot of surprises. It's at heart a tale about fitting in (or not) and the emotional toll of that. Something that every teenager has to come to terms with. And perhaps closeted gay teens more so than many others. This film captures the soaring romanticism of first love and the descent into craziness when it doesn't work out, when everything you wanted to believe about love is first shown to be an illusion--or worse, a fraud. The character of Paulie is riveting--she's a messy, damaged, romantic trainwreck. Tory is a heartbreaker who feels she's in a no-win situation and stumbles through it with unintended cruelty. And in her friendship with the two, the aptly-nicknamed Mouse finds a bit of herself. This is a film that's painted in big emotional brush-strokes that push the bounds of believability and yet somehow get the ardour and heartache of first love down pat.  My only wish is that more attention had been given to developing Mouse. In this story, she serves as observer/narrator, and with the exception of a few excellent scenes (one is when Mouse, Tory and Paulie receite the letters they wish they could write their mothers), she truly disappears into the woodwork. As it is, though, Mischa Barton's Mouse is a perfect observer: wide-eyed, smart, curious and extremely perceptive.

Saiz ""Norma Saiz""","[4, 6]","Many filmmakers use homosexuality as a comedic reference to make a comedy laugh at a gay man who does hair, a manly lesbian, or any of the stereotypical commercial image homosexuality is presented in hollywood today. Few movies captivate a true love story revolving homosexuality and I applaud Lea Pool for doing so with much success. This movie reminds me of a Shakespeare poem, so carefully written and so beautifully recited. Piper Perabo definitly struck a cord with me for her powerful performance as the heartbroken girl who turns dark and falls into her own surreal world of delirious fake emotions. A beautifully made movie, this should've got more attention than it did. I love how Lea represented Piper's isolation by a trapped eagle that Piper is teaching how to fly, ""You will fly away from here."" Piper longs for that eagle to be her, hoping she can flutter easily and softly from the heavy world around her. This is one of the few movies that made me cry, actually cry because of the emotional depths that it reached. This is a true gem in filmmaking and the acting couldn't have been any better by Piper. The movie thinks and feels her character revolving around landmines of depression where a way out seems almost impossible.

The story is related in an on again, off again fashion through the eyes of Mary B (Mischa Barton), though half the time it is presented independently of this character.  While some could argue that there should be more consistency with this, I did not find the inconsistency particularly disturbing.These are the passions of young (though not necessarily or unavoidably teen) first true love.  I have been a Paulie, and my Tory was a Serada, who cast me off with the same indifference.  Being in my twenties at the time, I knew that such depth of emotion and such passion was in no wise confined to teen years.  For many who watch this movie, it will be a retelling of agonizing first love, whether gay or straight, told from the depths of the heart where places remain unhealed through lifetimes.

We see a group of teenage girls in the all girls private schoool remotely tucked in somewhere on the east coast.  They are all sort of discards from their families.  Their parents have fulfilled the social contract of having children (or adopting them in some cases) and now that girls have reached a certain age, they are almost an inconvenience to their own parents.  Do not take me wrong,  they are not a problem kids - they are sent away so that their blended families can get some breathing space.  So this seemingly comfortable arrangement has one drawback.  These young women are craving for love and attention.  Tucked in school, away from families that care for them enough to pay hefty tuitiion, they bond by forming cliques or in some instances, strong loving relationships amongst each other.  Two of them fall in love and have sexual relationship that once discovered brings havoc around the entire school.  One of the grils (played by Piper Perabo) is sensitive, caring but unable to let go of her unfaithful lover who does not seem to want to resiprocate the love any longer.  It is in those tender moments of our heroine's distress that one can see that she fell in love with a person and the sex of the person is totally irrelevant to her. Our heroine is seeking love pure and unconditional the one that does not seek approval from the rest of the society.

Yes, a bit of nudity, and some &#34;lesbian&#34; writhing.  But if you actually watch the movie, it has some teeth.  Maybe it's because I knew a young woman who went through much of what this movie portrays, not as crazy, but all the slings and arrows of someone attracted to the same sex in a time when such was verboten (German: forbidden).  I never could understand all the hate and invective aimed at her simply because she wasn't just another &#34;boy toy&#34;.

I recommend it, especially if you want to learn that gays can be real people too, and teens  really do have to figure things out, sometimes with feelings the hard way, gay or straight.

Tori and Paulie share a loving relationship until one day they're caught in a compromising situation by Tori's sister. Paulie see's this as no big deal ""F*ck it, its the 21st century"" but Tori completely freaks out.

675898,A3CJN2S0XLVVLM,B00005QW5T,Silver Screen Videos,"[1, 1]","""Lost and Delirious"" is a touching, realistic story of a doomed first love for two college students. The only differences between this and dozens of similar movies over the years are (1) this movie is considerably better made than most, and (2) the two students are women.The film is set at an exclusive Canadian girl's college. Paulie (Piper Perabo, best known for TV's Covert Affairs) is the school rebel who refuses to acknowledge authority, and she and roommate Tory (Jessica Pare, the current Mrs. Don Draper on Mad Men) seem to inhabit a world of their own, without much concern for what others around them think. Tory and Paulie are actually more than just good friends; they have been carrying on an affair, which, when their third roommate, Mouse, learns about it, she is happy to keep a secret. Unfortunately, it doesn't remain a secret long when some of the other girls walk in on the pair in bed together. Tory, who comes from a wealthy family, is able to convince herself that the relationship was just a bit of harmless fun and tries to convince everyone else it never happened. Paulie, however, is deeply in love and doesn't want the relationship to end.The film belongs to Piper Perabo (better known for TV's Covert Affairs), whose Paulie tries to hide her hurt and longing behind a faade of literary braggadocio (at one point, she actually challenges Tory's new boyfriend to a swordfight duel). As often happens with young people, her attempts to act adult through her hurt reveal her actual immaturity and lack of understanding of the world. As she acts out her hurt feelings, Tory tries to extinguish her own feelings and get distance, both dramatic and literal, between her and Paulie. The two girls have a third roommate, freshman Mouse (Mischa Barton), a shy girl who initially was thrilled to be part of their circle but now finds herself a helpless observer. Both Pare and Barton are good, but the movie belongs to Perabo.Films like this often become either silly or excessively prurient, but the emotions in this one are genuine and raw. The movie doesn't avoid sensuality, there's a fair amount of nudity and softcore love scenes, but, more than anything it's a story of a doomed love affair.

675899,A3NJDTIEZY1I06,B00005QW5T,"S. Stinson ""book lover""","[148, 152]","""shall I abide in this dull world, which in thy absence is no better than a sty?"" -Antony and Cleopatra, Act IV, scene XVTake a touch of Shakespeare, a dash of drama, and the passion of first loves, and you'll have ""Lost and Delirious,"" the stunning  film by Canadian filmmaker, L&eacute;a Pool. Based on the novel, ""The Wives of Bath"" by Susan Swan, the film follows the lives of three very different boarding school roommates: shy and unassuming Mary ""Mouse"" Bradford (Mischa Barton, The Sixth Sense, TV's The O.C.), the striking and rakish rebel, Paulie (Piper Perabo, Coyote Ugly), and beautiful, but privileged Tory (Jessica Par&eacute;).Leaving behind a life filled with sadness since the death of her mother, Mouse is quickly embraced by her new roommates and discovers a sense of belonging for the first time in her life. Dubbed one of the ""lost girls"" by Paulie, she is mesmerized by Paulie's bold and rebellious nature. She also finds her roommates to be more than friends, as Paulie and Tory's late-night rendezvous and moments of whispered passion become part of her daily existence.Alas, nothing is forever, and the newfound peace Mouse has come to enjoy is soon shattered when Tory and Paulie are discovered, their relationship exposed. Faced with the possibility of her family finding out, Tory panics and abruptly ends the relationship, going to the extreme of fabricating lies and embracing a relationship with a boy from a neighboring school. All the while, Tory professes to Paulie she will never love anyone like she loves her, but it's time they ""grew out of it.""Tory's betrayal is nothing short of devastating to Paulie, who loves with all her heart and sees Tory as the only person who has ever loved her. Abandoned by her birth mother, Paulie had an almost desperate need to be loved and she found that in Tory. Faced with the loss of their love, she embarks on a mission to get her back and enlists Mouse as her partner in crime.Torn between the two, Mouse is overwhelmed. Her attempts to console Paulie are shunned after she tells Paulie that Tory's simply not a lesbian. ""Lesbian?"" Paulie responds, outraged. ""Are you f***ing kidding me? You think I'm a lesbian?! I am Paulie in love with Tory..."" At first glance, some lesbians may find that sort of response disturbing in a lesbian film. But if you reflect for a moment, you see the brilliance of L&eacute;a Pool's vision with that statement. For Paulie, she simply loves Tory. Period. End of story. It's not about being a lesbian and all the trappings of the word. It is simply about love from the heart. What Pool does is make you look beyond labels, beyond societal mandates, beyond the guilt placed on those who love outside society's approval, and allows you to see love in its purest form. She lets you see how we all could love if there were no rules.The character of Paulie is simply fantastic! Reminiscent of Angelina Jolie during her Oscar-winning portrayal of the sociopath, Lisa, in ""Girl, Interrupted,"" Perabo's performance is stunning as she embodies Paulie's eroding mental instability. For Paulie, life is all or nothing. ""Love is...it just is...,"" she says, and if you don't have it, you have nothing. Although young love is typically cast as desperate and angst-ridden, you actually feel Paulie's heartbreak and desperation over the loss of the only person who has ever loved her. The rollercoaster of Paulie's emotions increase when, after making love for the last time, Tory tells her that she will never love anyone as she does Paulie, kisses her, then leaves. Paulie's fragile state of mind is simply shattered after that and the consequences of her ensuing actions bring about an ending of Shakespearean proportion.The supporting cast is not to be forgotten. Jackie Burroughs as caring head mistress, Ms. Vaughn, and Mimi Kuzyk as tough professor, Ms. Bannet, are superb in their roles. Vaughn casts the sympathetic role, attempting to help Paulie as she spirals out of control, while Bannet plays the tough, but caring, partner who sees danger ahead. Although their relationship is never defined, it is questioned by the girls and often the topic of speculation. Graham Greene shines in his role as the school's gardener, and newfound friend and confidant, of Mouse. Insights into Mouse's life and her growing concern for what's happening and Paulie's deteriorating condition are played out during her moments with Greene in the most delightful manner.Brilliant directing, superb acting, and love's ultimate sacrifice - this film has it all. ""Lost and Delirious"" is a timeless tale about mad, passionate love that crosses all boundaries, and the tragic consequences we sometimes face when that love goes awry. It is truly destined to be a classic.",5,Angst-filled Love Story Tinged with Tragedy,1107993600,"02 10, 2005",2005,4750,"['shall', 'abide', 'dull', 'world', 'thy', 'absence', 'better', 'sty', '-Antony', 'Cleopatra', 'Act', 'IV', 'scene', 'XVTake', 'touch', 'Shakespeare', 'dash', 'drama', 'passion', 'first', 'loves', ""'ll"", 'have', 'Lost', 'Delirious', 'stunning', 'film', 'Canadian', 'filmmaker', 'L', 'eacute', 'Pool', 'Based', 'novel', 'Wives', 'Bath', 'Susan', 'Swan', 'film', 'lives', 'three', 'very', 'different', 'boarding', 'school', 'roommates', 'shy', 'unassuming', 'Mary', 'Mouse', 'Bradford', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'TV', 'O.C', 'striking', 'rakish', 'rebel', 'Paulie', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'beautiful', 'privileged', 'Tory', 'Jessica', 'Par', 'eacute', '.Leaving', 'life', 'filled', 'sadness', 'death', 'mother', 'Mouse', 'quickly', 'embraced', 'new', 'roommates', 'sense', 'belonging', 'first', 'time', 'life', 'Dubbed', 'one', 'lost', 'girls', 'Paulie', 'mesmerized', 'Paulie', 'bold', 'rebellious', 'nature', 'also', 'roommates', 'be', 'more', 'friends', 'Paulie', 'Tory', 'late-night', 'rendezvous', 'moments', 'whispered', 'passion', 'part', 'daily', 'existence.Alas', 'nothing', 'forever', 'newfound', 'peace', 'Mouse', 'come', 'enjoy', 'soon', 'shattered', 'when', 'Tory', 'Paulie', 'are', 'discovered', 'relationship', 'exposed', 'Faced', 'possibility', 'family', 'finding', 'out', 'Tory', 'panics', 'abruptly', 'relationship', 'going', 'extreme', 'fabricating', 'lies', 'embracing', 'relationship', 'boy', 'neighboring', 'school', 'while', 'Tory', 'Paulie', 'will', 'never', 'love', 'anyone', 'time', 'grew', 'Tory', 'betrayal', 'nothing', 'short', 'devastating', 'Paulie', 'who', 'heart', 'Tory', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'loved', 'Abandoned', 'birth', 'mother', 'Paulie', 'had', 'almost', 'desperate', 'need', 'be', 'loved', 'found', 'Tory', 'Faced', 'loss', 'love', 'mission', 'get', 'back', 'enlists', 'Mouse', 'partner', 'crime.Torn', 'two', 'Mouse', 'overwhelmed', 'attempts', 'console', 'Paulie', 'are', 'shunned', 'Paulie', 'Tory', 'simply', 'not', 'lesbian', 'Lesbian', 'Paulie', 'outraged', 'Are', 'f***ing', 'kidding', 'think', ""'m"", 'lesbian', 'am', 'Paulie', 'love', 'Tory', 'first', 'glance', 'lesbians', 'may', 'find', 'sort', 'response', 'disturbing', 'lesbian', 'film', 'reflect', 'moment', 'see', 'brilliance', 'L', 'eacute', 'Pool', 'vision', 'statement', 'Paulie', 'simply', 'Tory', 'Period', 'End', 'story', 'not', 'being', 'lesbian', 'trappings', 'word', 'simply', 'about', 'love', 'heart', 'What', 'Pool', 'make', 'look', 'labels', 'societal', 'mandates', 'guilt', 'placed', 'who', 'love', 'society', 'approval', 'see', 'love', 'purest', 'form', 'see', 'how', 'could', 'love', 'were', 'rules.The', 'character', 'Paulie', 'simply', 'fantastic', 'Reminiscent', 'Angelina', 'Jolie', 'Oscar-winning', 'portrayal', 'sociopath', 'Lisa', 'Girl', 'Interrupted', 'Perabo', 'performance', 'stunning', 'Paulie', 'eroding', 'mental', 'instability', 'Paulie', 'life', 'nothing', 'Love', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'have', 'nothing', 'young', 'love', 'typically', 'cast', 'desperate', 'angst-ridden', 'actually', 'feel', 'Paulie', 'heartbreak', 'desperation', 'loss', 'only', 'person', 'who', 'ever', 'loved', 'rollercoaster', 'Paulie', 'emotions', 'increase', 'when', 'making', 'love', 'last', 'time', 'Tory', 'will', 'never', 'love', 'anyone', 'Paulie', 'then', 'Paulie', 'fragile', 'state', 'mind', 'simply', 'shattered', 'consequences', 'ensuing', 'actions', 'bring', 'ending', 'Shakespearean', 'proportion.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'not', 'be', 'forgotten', 'Jackie', 'Burroughs', 'caring', 'head', 'mistress', 'Ms.', 'Vaughn', 'Mimi', 'Kuzyk', 'tough', 'professor', 'Ms.', 'Bannet', 'are', 'superb', 'roles', 'Vaughn', 'sympathetic', 'role', 'attempting', 'help', 'Paulie', 'control', 'Bannet', 'tough', 'caring', 'partner', 'who', 'danger', 'ahead', 'relationship', 'never', 'defined', 'questioned', 'girls', 'often', 'topic', 'speculation', 'Graham', 'Greene', 'shines', 'role', 'school', 'gardener', 'newfound', 'friend', 'confidant', 'Mouse', 'Insights', 'Mouse', 'life', 'growing', 'concern', 'what', 'happening', 'Paulie', 'deteriorating', 'condition', 'are', 'played', 'out', 'moments', 'Greene', 'most', 'delightful', 'manner.Brilliant', 'directing', 'superb', 'acting', 'love', 'ultimate', 'sacrifice', 'film', 'Lost', 'Delirious', 'timeless', 'tale', 'mad', 'passionate', 'love', 'boundaries', 'tragic', 'consequences', 'sometimes', 'face', 'when', 'love', 'awry', 'truly', 'destined', 'be', 'classic']",N/A

675901,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00005QW5T,Tsuyoshi,"[11, 17]","This is a film with a lofty aim, and its cause is worth as that of &quot;Boy's Don't Cry.&quot;  And things that would make a good film are certainly there.  But for all those facts, I cannot help feeling that this is a missed opportunity, and the following is the reason.&quot;Lost and Delirious&quot; concerns a girl Pauline in a boarding school falling in love with her roommate Victoria, and newly arrived roommate Mary aka &quot;Mouse&quot; who becomes a mutual friend of them.  Pauline and Victoria keeps on the relations until one morning Victoria's sister finds them naked in bed.  Vitoria, afraid of losing the esteem of her parents, leaves Paulie to her utter dismay.  Enraged, passionate, Pauline still clings to her lost love, and comes an inevitable ending.The film cleverly avoids the stereotyped images of conservative teachers who do not approve of lesbiamism.  In fact, they are always understanding, and the headmaster really cares the students.  So, when Pauline sneaks a bottle of gin, and plays a song of rock'n'roll loudly on the cassette deck, the teachers don't get upset; they too enjoy the good time, dancing to the tune.  Interestingly, however, though the story is set in today, it sometimes looks as if not, maybe because of the good production design of the old-fashioned boarding school, and well-written characters.  So far, the film is very good and unique, and this may reflect the expreiences of the director Lea Pool, who was once a teacher herself.This film is said to be based on a novel which I haven't read, and it is palpable that the material itself has considerable potential.  But the film fails to transfer the power to the screen even though the cast, especially Piper Perabo, does her best.  Perhaps, it is the director that didn't know what to do with the topic, which could have been done better.But what is wrong?  Perabo does a good job, but sometimes her acting as a troubled girl seems (just seems) overacting.  Let me hurriedly add that to what extent she is responsible, I don't know.  I can say that though &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; was not a big hit, and critically bashed, in that she is very natural, and I loved that.  Here, she is not.  Think of the scene when Pauline kneels down before now estranged Victoria in a library, and quotes lines of Shakespeare (with unnecessary sound effect of a squealing hawk).  Or, see how angry and lonely Paulie starts to rave in a cafeteria, when the camera pulls back in a flash, and suddenly moves in slow motion, showing MTV like techiniques.  Everytime this heavy-handed direction appears on the screen, her natural charm vanishes, and the film gives away that she is acting, which itself, however, is all right.And ... casting, which should be considered more carefully.  About Piper Perabo, she was from the first in a disadvantageous position because &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot; is a story about a bar, where, of course, no minor can be admitted, and then, she appears in this  film about a boarding school for teenage girls.  Moreover, at the time of shooting the film, she was 23 years old -- that is not a big problem if you didn't know co-starring Mischa Barton as Mouse was only 14.  (You may remember that Barton was in &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; as a little girl under the table with a video casette.)  I don't care their ages; I just want to say that their previous career can sometimes affect our viewing, and they should take care of the importance of casting more.But perhaps if I didn't like the final result of the film, it is because of the director's way of putting too allegorical factorsinto the film.  There is one about a wounded hawk; there's one about fencing; there's also about Shakespeare, but frankly, I don't think the film need them all.  And Barton, who usually gives acting full of nuance, only stares and narrates the events around her, which is very disappointing, and pointless, considering why in the world she &quot;Mouse&quot; is here.  About Jessica Pare the same thing can be said; why Paulie is so atracted to her, is not, I am afraid, fully materialized on the screen.This Canadian film received good reviews at Sundance Film Festival, and I can understand that.  I don't say it is bad; however, we have seen much better films like &quot;Show Me Love.&quot;  Or in the vein of comedy, how about &quot;But I'm a Cheerleader&quot;?  If I may be allowed to extend the topic from lesbianism to honosexuality, we get also delightful &quot;Get Real&quot; and many others.  &quot;Lost and Delirious&quot; deserves much mention and audience, but what it needs is another skillful hand to direct it.",2,"Worthy Attempt, But Falls Short of Charm of &quot;Show Me Love&quot;",1028073600,"07 31, 2002",2002,4628,"['film', 'lofty', 'aim', 'cause', 'worth', 'quot', 'Boy', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Cry.', 'quot', 'things', 'would', 'make', 'good', 'film', 'are', 'certainly', 'there', 'facts', 'can', 'not', 'help', 'feeling', 'missed', 'opportunity', 'following', 'reason.', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Delirious', 'quot', 'girl', 'Pauline', 'boarding', 'school', 'falling', 'love', 'roommate', 'Victoria', 'newly', 'arrived', 'roommate', 'Mary', 'aka', 'quot', 'Mouse', 'quot', 'who', 'mutual', 'friend', 'Pauline', 'Victoria', 'relations', 'one', 'morning', 'Victoria', 'sister', 'naked', 'bed', 'Vitoria', 'afraid', 'losing', 'esteem', 'parents', 'Paulie', 'utter', 'dismay', 'Enraged', 'passionate', 'Pauline', 'still', 'lost', 'love', 'inevitable', 'ending.The', 'film', 'cleverly', 'stereotyped', 'images', 'conservative', 'teachers', 'who', 'do', 'not', 'approve', 'lesbiamism', 'fact', 'are', 'always', 'understanding', 'headmaster', 'really', 'students', 'So', 'when', 'Pauline', 'bottle', 'gin', 'song', 'rock', ""n'roll"", 'loudly', 'cassette', 'deck', 'teachers', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'upset', 'too', 'enjoy', 'good', 'time', 'dancing', 'tune', 'Interestingly', 'however', 'story', 'set', 'today', 'sometimes', 'not', 'maybe', 'good', 'production', 'design', 'old-fashioned', 'boarding', 'school', 'well-written', 'characters', 'So', 'far', 'film', 'very', 'good', 'unique', 'may', 'reflect', 'expreiences', 'director', 'Lea', 'Pool', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'teacher', 'herself.This', 'film', 'said', 'be', 'based', 'novel', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'palpable', 'material', 'considerable', 'potential', 'film', 'transfer', 'power', 'screen', 'even', 'cast', 'especially', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'best', 'Perhaps', 'director', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'what', 'do', 'topic', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'better.But', 'what', 'wrong', 'Perabo', 'good', 'job', 'sometimes', 'acting', 'troubled', 'girl', 'just', 'overacting', 'Let', 'hurriedly', 'add', 'what', 'extent', 'responsible', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'say', 'quot', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'quot', 'was', 'not', 'big', 'hit', 'critically', 'bashed', 'very', 'natural', 'loved', 'Here', 'not', 'Think', 'scene', 'when', 'Pauline', 'down', 'before', 'now', 'estranged', 'Victoria', 'library', 'lines', 'Shakespeare', 'unnecessary', 'sound', 'effect', 'squealing', 'hawk', 'see', 'how', 'angry', 'lonely', 'Paulie', 'rave', 'cafeteria', 'when', 'camera', 'back', 'flash', 'suddenly', 'moves', 'slow', 'motion', 'showing', 'MTV', 'techiniques', 'Everytime', 'heavy-handed', 'direction', 'screen', 'natural', 'charm', 'vanishes', 'film', 'away', 'acting', 'however', 'right.And', 'casting', 'should', 'be', 'considered', 'more', 'carefully', 'Piper', 'Perabo', 'was', 'first', 'disadvantageous', 'position', 'quot', 'Coyote', 'Ugly', 'quot', 'story', 'bar', 'where', 'course', 'minor', 'can', 'be', 'admitted', 'then', 'film', 'boarding', 'school', 'teenage', 'girls', 'Moreover', 'time', 'shooting', 'film', 'was', '23', 'years', 'old', 'not', 'big', 'problem', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'co-starring', 'Mischa', 'Barton', 'Mouse', 'was', 'only', '14', 'may', 'remember', 'Barton', 'was', 'quot', 'Sixth', 'Sense', 'quot', 'little', 'girl', 'table', 'video', 'casette', 'do', ""n't"", 'care', 'ages', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'previous', 'career', 'can', 'sometimes', 'affect', 'viewing', 'should', 'take', 'care', 'importance', 'casting', 'more.But', 'perhaps', 'did', ""n't"", 'final', 'result', 'film', 'director', 'way', 'putting', 'too', 'allegorical', 'factorsinto', 'film', 'one', 'wounded', 'hawk', 'one', 'fencing', 'also', 'about', 'Shakespeare', 'frankly', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'need', 'Barton', 'who', 'usually', 'acting', 'full', 'nuance', 'only', 'events', 'very', 'disappointing', 'pointless', 'considering', 'why', 'world', 'quot', 'Mouse', 'quot', 'here', 'Jessica', 'Pare', 'same', 'thing', 'can', 'be', 'said', 'why', 'Paulie', 'so', 'atracted', 'not', 'am', 'afraid', 'fully', 'materialized', 'screen.This', 'Canadian', 'film', 'received', 'good', 'reviews', 'Sundance', 'Film', 'Festival', 'can', 'understand', 'do', ""n't"", 'say', 'bad', 'however', 'have', 'seen', 'much', 'better', 'films', 'quot', 'Show', 'Me', 'Love.', 'quot', 'vein', 'comedy', 'how', 'quot', ""'m"", 'Cheerleader', 'quot', 'may', 'be', 'allowed', 'extend', 'topic', 'lesbianism', 'honosexuality', 'get', 'also', 'delightful', 'quot', 'Get', 'Real', 'quot', 'many', 'others', 'quot', 'Lost', 'Delirious', 'quot', 'much', 'mention', 'audience', 'what', 'skillful', 'hand', 'direct']",N/A
