1624078,A1UV1GD4DFXLEM,B00BB8LU5Y,"Hucklebarry ""Hucklebarry""","[11, 14]","I'm a little torn on the ""manufacturing on demand"" model.  I'll say upfront, that I like it, and hope to see season 9 soon.  But it has its drawbacks.With this season, you get each episode, unmodified in any way (good or bad).  That is all.  No deleted scenes, no gag reel, no previews, no bonus content of ANY kind... not even subtitles.  Nothing is remastered, polished, enhanced, or corrected in any way.Keep the above in mind when it comes to the price.  Typically, when I buy the DVD for something its to experience MORE of the product.  I've seen Night Court on TV, I want the DVDs for all the extra goodies that tend to come with them.  In this regard, there are no extras.On the other hand, Night Court does not air on any network I have access to and its been years since I have seen an episode.  So this model is providing the one thing that no one else is... Night Court.  Not more, but Night Court all the same.  After all these years, I still chuckle at the sitcom.  Some jokes are a little corny, but overall the series has aged very well.The quality of the episodes are a little rough.  Visually These need some work, but are tolerable for just wanting to watch the show.  Again, just don't expect anything in terms of extra or quality that didn't air as the actual show.For a no-frills version made on demand, the price seems very high.  I expected something one third to one fourth of the asking price.  If all you want is Night Court, this service can provide just that.  I highly recommend the show, but caution you to hold your expectations very low for this specific product.",3,"Its Night Court, but nothing else",1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,1596,"[""'m"", 'little', 'torn', 'manufacturing', 'demand', 'model', ""'ll"", 'say', 'upfront', 'like', 'hope', 'see', 'season', '9', 'soon', 'drawbacks.With', 'season', 'get', 'episode', 'unmodified', 'way', 'good', 'bad', 'No', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'gag', 'reel', 'previews', 'bonus', 'content', 'ANY', 'kind', 'not', 'even', 'subtitles', 'Nothing', 'remastered', 'polished', 'enhanced', 'corrected', 'way.Keep', 'above', 'mind', 'when', 'price', 'Typically', 'when', 'buy', 'DVD', 'something', 'experience', 'MORE', 'product', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Night', 'Court', 'TV', 'want', 'DVDs', 'extra', 'goodies', 'tend', 'come', 'regard', 'are', 'other', 'hand', 'Night', 'Court', 'not', 'air', 'network', 'have', 'access', 'been', 'years', 'have', 'seen', 'episode', 'model', 'providing', 'one', 'thing', 'one', 'else', 'Night', 'Court', 'Not', 'more', 'Night', 'Court', 'same', 'years', 'still', 'chuckle', 'sitcom', 'jokes', 'are', 'little', 'corny', 'series', 'aged', 'very', 'well.The', 'quality', 'episodes', 'are', 'little', 'rough', 'Visually', 'need', 'work', 'are', 'tolerable', 'just', 'wanting', 'watch', 'show', 'Again', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'anything', 'terms', 'extra', 'quality', 'did', ""n't"", 'air', 'actual', 'show.For', 'no-frills', 'version', 'made', 'demand', 'price', 'very', 'high', 'expected', 'something', 'one', 'third', 'one', 'fourth', 'asking', 'price', 'want', 'Night', 'Court', 'service', 'can', 'provide', 'just', 'highly', 'recommend', 'show', 'caution', 'hold', 'expectations', 'very', 'low', 'specific', 'product']",Night Court: The Complete Eighth Season

It was his personality, his idiosyncracies. He was right, and they were right to cast him in the lead. Nobody else could have fit that part so perfectly. The rest of the cast was also outstanding. It was unfortunate that they kept changing the defense counsel, but John Larroquet  was brilliant, and went on to many outstanding productions, including Boston Legal.
