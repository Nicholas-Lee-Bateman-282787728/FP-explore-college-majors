176162,A2EEUQ81DTY7G3,1419838830,A Customer,"[4, 5]","V For Vendetta certainly tackles some provocative and timely themes: media and government manipulation, and terrorism and the old adage that power corrupts and governments will single-handedly manipulate the populace to stay in power.  The film is packed with ideas - sometimes a little too many - but it's a smartly designed and superbly acted thriller and it actually gives you something to think about while you're watching the Britain's Parliament House get blown up.V For Vendetta indeed presents a scary scenario. It is England in 2020. The effects of world instability, including the downfall of the United States, have finally reached the country and now fascist political party has come to power, in the form of a draconian Thatcherism predicated on order, conformity and intolerance.With the government mushrooming into totalitarian repression, the public is controlled through police repression, surveillance and propaganda - particularly through the media. High Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) is a despot who rants from giant video monitors. Homosexuality or owning a Koran - unauthorized love and unauthorized faith - are capital crimes and free speech is seen as a disloyalty to the party, to the government and to the country. Into this mix comes the freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) who wears a mask and models himself in Britain's most famous revolutionary, Guy Fawkes.V is a revolutionary and an ideologue, his conversation is dense with analysis and philosophy; his fortress of solitude isn't a museum of weaponry, but a vast library and art gallery. He is a fearsome hand-to-hand fighter, who thinks of nothing of murdering to make his point. The center of his campaign is the protection of Evey (a ravishing Natalie Portman) when he saves her from being menaced by the secret police for violating curfew.The police (led by Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) suspect that Evey is his accomplice, and V takes her into his sanctum for her own protection. As she witnesses him blow up the Old Bailey, Every falls ever more into V's revolutionary web. The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers parallels areas of government surveillance, torture, fear-mongering and media manipulation, not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy, the references to current events being opportune depending on your world view.Whilst the back-story involving both Evey and V's past is a little convoluted, the Director James McTeigue adroitly visualizes the multifaceted story and keeps the action moving at a fast pace. At times, the script is a little overly alliterative and a section involving Stephen Fry's television host is filmed in such a way that it's hard to tell what's going on.The actors, however, are all suburb: Portman is wrenching as the victimized Evey, well matched by the masked Weaving, who crafts a terrific performance from body language and vocal inflections. Although V for Vendetta is not without its faults, it's still a timely, surprisingly entertaining and totally thought-provoking film on a future-world that could so easily come about in any country given the right political environment.

You cannot stop yourself from buying it, since it is like the Mask you wear to go see the movie.In this movie, a terrorist called V recruits an acquired ally he rescues by chance. Soon he begins spreading his propaganda by getting people to wear his masks. Like those masks, this DVD spreads ideas in the minds of others, who then begin to appreciate his control over his mind and try to exert control over their own minds, in order to block the media suppression and violence stopping information from being spread. This movie supposes that even in restrictive areas and physical places like dictatorships, you can survive somehow with the mind intact. It urges you not to policy hate and destruction and instead policy information and dialogue. It is the hypnotist's manual, and it is the disgrace of politics.It further introduces you to the world of terrorism, that being a terrorist to self is a kind of self-meditation, since it takes HARD WORK being a good person in a world dominated by war, intrigue, politics, and poison. Poison because this world's worst fear is sickness and genetic codes.Deluded by self-intelligence, V attempts to break into a news tower and tries to broadcast his message all over. His first mistake, however, becomes almost his last, and that is how he meets his heroine, who saves him with a can of Mace. This begins the whole plot of the movie, and it doesn't really feel like a movie for the first part. V spouts so many words with the first letter 'v' to our heroine that it feels like you're reading a book.The first movie I've seen that makes movies look as moral and interesting as books. Certainly, parents won't want to censor this one and tell their kids that ""movies and television screens are bad for you"" and encourage them to read Clifford instead. I hardly need to say that seeing this once will open your mind if you're a right-wing extremist or hate Islam, since both are discussed here. In fact, ring-wingism is determinedly the status of this movie, and you should consider ordering your mind to this behavior if you truly believe politics can change world destinies, or World War III.",5,An amazing joke at meditation!,1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,2272,"['movie', 'other', 'movies', 'special', 'effects', 'brilliantly', 'simple', 'ruse', 'get', 'laugh', 'buy', 'DVD', 'can', 'not', 'stop', 'buying', 'Mask', 'wear', 'go', 'see', 'movie.In', 'movie', 'terrorist', 'called', 'V', 'acquired', 'ally', 'chance', 'spreading', 'propaganda', 'getting', 'people', 'wear', 'masks', 'masks', 'DVD', 'ideas', 'minds', 'others', 'who', 'then', 'begin', 'appreciate', 'control', 'mind', 'try', 'exert', 'control', 'own', 'minds', 'order', 'block', 'media', 'suppression', 'violence', 'stopping', 'information', 'being', 'spread', 'movie', 'even', 'restrictive', 'areas', 'physical', 'places', 'dictatorships', 'can', 'survive', 'somehow', 'mind', 'intact', 'not', 'policy', 'hate', 'destruction', 'instead', 'policy', 'information', 'dialogue', 'hypnotist', 'manual', 'disgrace', 'politics.It', 'further', 'introduces', 'world', 'terrorism', 'being', 'terrorist', 'self', 'kind', 'self-meditation', 'HARD', 'WORK', 'being', 'good', 'person', 'world', 'dominated', 'war', 'intrigue', 'politics', 'poison', 'Poison', 'world', 'worst', 'fear', 'sickness', 'genetic', 'codes.Deluded', 'self-intelligence', 'V', 'break', 'news', 'tower', 'tries', 'broadcast', 'message', 'first', 'mistake', 'however', 'almost', 'last', 'how', 'heroine', 'who', 'can', 'Mace', 'whole', 'plot', 'movie', ""n't"", 'really', 'feel', 'movie', 'first', 'part', 'V', 'spouts', 'so', 'many', 'words', 'first', 'letter', 'v', 'heroine', ""'re"", 'reading', 'book.The', 'first', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'movies', 'look', 'moral', 'interesting', 'books', 'Certainly', 'parents', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'censor', 'one', 'tell', 'kids', 'movies', 'television', 'screens', 'are', 'bad', 'encourage', 'read', 'Clifford', 'instead', 'hardly', 'need', 'say', 'seeing', 'once', 'will', 'open', 'mind', ""'re"", 'right-wing', 'extremist', 'hate', 'Islam', 'are', 'discussed', 'here', 'fact', 'ring-wingism', 'determinedly', 'status', 'movie', 'should', 'consider', 'ordering', 'mind', 'behavior', 'truly', 'believe', 'politics', 'can', 'change', 'world', 'destinies', 'World', 'War', 'III']",N/A

Though V himself is taking personal revenge in the way of killing the leaders in control, his appeal to people is not one of violence. He appeals to people to wake up from their slumber and stand up against the endless lies and brutality of the regime. That this is the message is clearly seen in his speeches as well as the way in which the people respond to it.The scene at the end of the film where thousands of people, young and old march unarmed, hand in hand against the oppressors and the troops, is an extremely powerful message and reminiscent of the power of Gandhi's message of non-violence and civil disobedience.As this non-violent uprising culminates in the film on the 5th of November, it is a timely reminder to go out and buy this video and let the message sink in.As a follow up reading ""1984"" by George Orwell, is eerily close in describing the fascist society that is shown in the film and sadly also close to the way things are going.

176167,A3M2EGEIH4X2RZ,1419838830,"aficionado guy ""aficionado guy""","[259, 403]","I will put up with a lot from certain films.  I don't mind low budgets, inexperienced actors, flawed screenplays, etc., if the film has something good to offer.  That's one reason why I liked ""Bound,"" an earlier low budget offering from the Wachowski brothers.But I won't put up with a run-your-agenda-down-your-throat film from anyone.What's the difference between a normal film and. a run-the-agenda-down-your-throat film?  Well, for starters, the latter will feature ""good"" characters as wonderful, happy people with no character flaws whatsoever, while the ""bad"" characters will be completely corrupt and evil with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever.  A lot of writers have written stories as simplistic as this - when they were nine years old.Of course, a lot of great art was created with an agenda in mind.  Steinbeck's stated purpose in writing the Grapes of Wrath was to create sympathy for the plight of the migrant farm worker.  But he created memorable, well-rounded characters and a mature storyline, and in the process created great art - none of which V for Vendetta even tries to do.But don't take my word for it - decide for yourself.  Might this film have an anti-Christian, pro-gay agenda or no?  Let's see:1. The evil government is a fascist Christian theocracy, with a modified cross as symbol in the color scheme (red/black) of Nazi Germany.2. Every representative of the government is completely evil and corrupt with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever3. This evil government locks up/kills homosexuals for walking down the street hand-in-hand4. We are told that this Christian theocracy arose because of ""America's War,"" while we see news footage from Iraq5. Despite this current events reference, apparently showing a desire to root the film in reality, no acknowledgement is ever made that this type of ""oppression"" and ""fascism"" isn't actually happening in democracies.  That is, neither North America nor Europe actually haul off and kill homosexuals, but current Muslim theocracies like Iran and Saudi Arabia do.6. Despite this, a gay TV producer owns a copy of the government-outlawed Koran, which he says he likes for its ""poetry.""  Somehow its denunciations of gays and exhortations to kill them doesn't faze him7. The same gay TV producer is taken away by jackbooted thugs for criticizing the government, and later executed for owning a copy of the Koran8. With the possible exception of ""V,"" every protagonist is a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving character with no character flaws whatsoever.  Even Natalie Portman is so good-hearted she forgives V for imprisoning, torturing and humiliating her, falls in love with him and commits terrorism for him in the name of their ""love.""9. We are treated to an overly long flashback of a wonderful, well-adjusted and giving lesbian character with no character flaws whatsoever who recounts how she ""just wanted to love in peace"" but was hauled off, tortured and executed by the Christian Theocracy just for being gay.10. The head of the Christian church is an accomplice to murder and torture, is overtly corrupt, and is a pedophile.  Oddly enough, however, he is fixated on underage girls, not boys.  But why not?  After other attempts to have the film vaguely reflect reality, why not portray what is unfortunately the norm of priest pedophilia scandals, that is, man-boy?  Could it be that to portray homosexuality in any less-than-favorable light would be unacceptable?11. Despite the worldwide concerns about terrorists and their attacks against civilians in dozens of countries worldwide, the apparent goal of the film is for the viewer to better understand why a terrorist would blow up buildings, murder innocent civilians and take down a government (?????)No, I'm sorry, this film was one long agenda-spouting travesty from start to finish.

Gyurisin ""good friend, damn fool""","[0, 1]","""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a masked terrorist running amuck in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers.  This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster.  While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through.  Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold.  The ""happy"" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel.  The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film.  ""V for Vendetta"" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered.  Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film?  To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of ""V"" perfectly.  The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended.  Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant.  The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character.  ""V"", with this film, became iconic.  Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded ""V"".  The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak.  ""V"" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control.  Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character - and then there was Portman.  While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate.  Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding.  These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.""V for Vendetta"" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by ""Cat Power""), and intense ideals.  It is a thinking film.  It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments.  It will keep your mind occupied for hours.  McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting.  As mentioned before, what makes ""V for Vendetta"" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film - it moved it in a different direction.  Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought - but it isn't a complete masterpiece.  I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today - the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time.  Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.Grade: *** out of *****",3,Chapter 11: Valhalla,1243728000,"05 31, 2009",2009,3629,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'more', 'just', 'masked', 'terrorist', 'running', 'amuck', 'futuristic', 'Britain', 'more', 'just', 'quick', 'wits', 'anti-hero', 'challenging', 'government', 'far', 'more', 'just', 'follow-up', 'film', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'philosophical', 'cinematic', 'entry', 'disguised', 'blockbuster', 'most', 'will', 'argue', 'poor', 'excuse', 'graphic', 'novel', 'slightly', 'agree', ""n't"", 'follow', 'story', 'frame', 'frame', 'themes', 'are', 'still', 'pulled', 'Looking', 'back', 'graphic', 'novel', 'changes', 'made', 'page', 'screen', 'were', 'dramatic', 'yet', 'bold', 'happy', 'ending', 'film', 'way', 'more', 'dismal', 'slightly', 'uplifting', 'ending', 'graphic', 'novel', 'main', 'difference', 'two', 'lack', 'grittiness', 'one', 'could', 'call', 'realism', 'found', 'story', 'missing', 'film', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'film', 'beautiful', 'watched', 'full', 'HD', 'sound', 'visuals', 'colors', 'are', 'exactly', 'opposite', 'graphic', 'novel', 'comparing', 'two', 'not', 'extent', 'review', 'element', 'be', 'considered', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'took', 'name', 'film', 'reading', 'graphic', 'novel', 'will', 'explain', 'why.With', 'said', 'what', 'worked', 'was', 'miscalculated', 'film', 'begin', 'Wachowskis', 'coupled', 'direction', 'director', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'captured', 'visual', 'V', 'perfectly', 'mask', 'was', 'chilling', 'darkened', 'question', 'origins', 'remained', 'open-ended', 'depiction', 'masked', 'vigilante', 'was', 'brilliant', 'way', 'shadows', 'fell', 'camera', 'face', 'instilled', 'fear', 'excitement', 'character', 'V', 'film', 'became', 'iconic', 'Alas', 'visual', 'alone', 'could', ""n't"", 'counter', 'what', 'preceded', 'V', 'use', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'voice', 'was', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'accent', 'weak', 'V', 'was', 'bold', 'character', 'when', 'spoke', 'seemed', 'weaker', 'less', 'control', 'Weaving', 'voice-work', 'did', ""n't"", 'capture', 'intensity', 'character', 'then', 'was', 'Portman', 'brought', 'innocence', 'character', 'Eve', 'name', 'symbolic', 'as', 'well', 'poignant', 'fading', 'British', 'accent', 'continued', 'idea', 'was', 'merely', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'playing', 'character', 'not', 'just', 'Eve', 'incarnate', 'Stephen', 'Rae', 'was', 'superb', 'role', 'always', 'tamed', 'cop', 'hunting', 'belief', 'John', 'Hurt', 'was', 'completely', 'top', 'applauding', 'role', 'as', 'evil', 'outstanding', 'secondary', 'characters', 'proving', 'might', 'stronger', 'primary', 'ones', 'added', 'much', 'needed', 'relief', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'perfect', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'great', 'film', 'sit', 'down', 'enjoy', 'two', 'hours', 'crisp', 'visuals', 'amazing', 'music', 'look', 'beautiful', 'cover', 'Cat', 'Power', 'intense', 'ideals', 'thinking', 'film', 'big-budget', 'action/adventure', 'film', 'while', 'asking', 'see', 'modern', 'news', 'question', 'governments', 'will', 'keep', 'mind', 'occupied', 'hours', 'McTeigue', 'did', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'modern', 'relevance', 'still', 'tragic', 'today', 'film', 'create', 'timeless', 'sensation', 'still', ""n't"", 'counter', 'disappointing', 'acting', 'mentioned', 'what', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'graphic', 'novel', 'work', 'characters', 'lacked', 'film', 'moved', 'different', 'direction', 'graphic', 'novel', 'film', 'still', 'entertainment', 'slight', 'thought', ""n't"", 'complete', 'masterpiece', 'enjoyed', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'first', 'released', 'big', 'screen', 'watching', 'today', 'small', 'nuances', 'characters', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'hold', 'up', 'well', 'time', 'message', 'tact', 'body.Grade', '***', '*****']",N/A
176170,A1AUOVXPT5MYX4,1419838830,"A. Hutchinson ""Boogie Down Bronx""","[1, 3]","Well, I put off going to this film after reading a couple of reviews. It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't.This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.I like this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema.

176172,A3FVIFL4HGI5CL,1419838830,Alexiel,"[41, 53]","""V For Vendetta"" was originally a graphic novel illustrated by David Lloyd and written by Alan Moore, who became famous from the great ""Watchmen"" series and may be known to movie goers for ""From Hell,"" and ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" neither of which were the best-executed or successful of film adaptations.""V For Vendetta"" gets it right this time, for sure. I don't like it as much as ""Sin City,"" but I also don't think it's fair to make that comparison seriously - the two works/movies succeed on different levels and have different objectives.Also, I can say right off the bat, this movie is not going to please all fans of ""V."" The look is somewhat different and some of the character traits and subplots are gone. But in my opinion, it doesn't hurt it. But there will be acrimonious debate. Oh yes, there will be.Like most comic book/graphic novels and their accompanying movies, ""V"" brings a wonderfully epic feeling by interspersing larger-than-life goals, scenarios, and characters with the more intimate, personal, and emotional aspect of human life. Instead of ""wonderfully epic"" some critics might suggest ""overblown melodrama."" I do not agree, but to each their own.The United Kingdom of the ""future"" (no surprise or problem this was different) is under the control of a dystopian, Orwellian government. It is a world sorely in need of a hero. On Guy Fawkes Day, such a hero arrives. A masked freedom fighter (or ""terrorist,"" whichever you choose) blows up Parliament in an act of rebellion. But there is more to it than that, something that has deep ties to the corrupt totalitarian government, how they achieved power, and the dark history of those involved. Something that demands vengeance. Along the way V saves Evey, the requisite Mysterious Beautiful Girl with the Mysterious Past. However, ""V For Vendetta"" was written before these things became such tired conventions, so I'm forgiving in this instance, and furthermore it still works to this day when handled correctly, as it does here. But this is all the plot I want to give, the rest should come as a surprise to those of you who have not read the original work. Needless to say the stakes rise faster than maybe even the irrepressible and Byronic V can keep up with, and Evey will have a lot to find out about the both of them. That should be enough to entice the casual review reader.The acting is very good. Hugo Weaving plays a not-unfamiliar comic book/anime type hero that could be easily and unintentionally hammed up. He does not. I am actually not a big fan of his at all, but I have to give the man his due - he shows us what a fan of the graphic novel series expects to be shown, in most of the important facets.Some people have expressed discontent because Natalie Portman is ""too high profile"" or ""not British"" or because they just plain don't like her. As with Weaving, I wasn't really a fan coming into this movie. Roles like Evey's are pretty meaty and easy to look good in. However, Portman did more than I expected with the role, which is saying something because I was expecting a lot and ready to write a snarky little review trashing her performance. Instead, I have to eat my words of a few days ago - ""I think there were better choices for Evey."" Whoops. Looking at the job she did, I'm dubious now. Even as a Portman detractor, I have to say, she's forging an interesting body of work that may soon begin to silence her critics.I like Stephen Rea in virtually everything I see him in and this is no exception. The man is one of the most talented supporting actors of the day.The rest of the supporting cast was fine but of course these three jumped out at me.The cinematography was indeed flashy, as you'd expect. I refuse to draw comparisons to certain other movies, and while I'm not usually a fan of the all-out style of these other movies that have been relentlessly parodied, there are some very well-done and exciting scenes, with an eye toward a more leisurely (and interesting) pacing than you might expect from a movie such as this. As I said above, the look of Alan Moore's world is not well captured, and that's my biggest mark against the movie, but the filmmakers have their own style, and it is not a bad one.Lastly, I am surprised at some of the angst expressed that ""V For Vendetta"" promotes, justifies, and glorifies terrorism, particularly as viewed in a modern context. ""V For Vendetta"" was started back in 1981. Whatever broader themes or messages people may think the movie touches on in lieu of the media firestorm over Middle Eastern terrorism and scorn heaped on movies like ""Valley of the Wolves,"" I rather think the vast majority of them are brought to the table by the viewer's interpretation or bias, not by the filmmakers.In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone reading these reviews and fans of graphic novels and comics.

176174,A39IBJB2PBVC7I,1419838830,Alistair McHarg,"[1, 4]","I was fortunate in that I brought no expectations to this film.  I didn't know it was from the ""Matrix"" crowd, a film I very much enjoyed.  If anything I thought it was one of those dumb Batman, Spiderman super-hero movies that offer light entertainment - the artistic equivalent of cotton candy.  What I found instead was that rarest of all creatures, a blockbuster film with wonderful production values that entertains and actually engages the mind by posing interesting and difficult questions.Hugo Weaving does more with his voice and movements than most actors do with their entire toolkit; he was perfectly cast as the man behind the mask.  Natalie Portman is excellent as the reluctant co-conspirator, drawn into V's world.  Stephen Rea is downright great as Chief Inspector Finch, our ""everyman"" figure who must sort through the rubble to dislodge truth.  John Hurt seems to be channeling William Smith from 1984, with a soupcon of Hitler, his frenzy and fury are thoroughly convincing.What makes the film so brave and unusual is that, in our nervous age, it actually casts a terrorist as hero.  This is heady stuff and reminds us that, ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.""  V presents an interesting blend of instant karma, righteous vengeance, and social idealism.  Though his motives are personal, he does understand them in a larger context.  His handoff to Portman at the finish recalls the desire of Generals to create a world where their children can study philosophy.V is unlike many movies in that it has a superb 2nd act.  Portman's time in the faux prison, and the powerful epistolary relationship with the unseen individual one cell over, provide this film with a compelling underlying humanity.  Political references abound in V, as do film references, and they all serve to reinforce the core idea that governments really are created to serve people, not vice versa, and when that ceases to be the case, something must be done.  Perhaps the discomfort surrounding this film would be diminished if we all recalled that's precisely what our beloved founding fathers did.",5,"Brave, Challenging, Smart",1204416000,"03 2, 2008",2008,2109,"['was', 'fortunate', 'brought', 'expectations', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'was', 'Matrix', 'crowd', 'film', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'anything', 'thought', 'was', 'one', 'dumb', 'Batman', 'Spiderman', 'super-hero', 'movies', 'offer', 'light', 'entertainment', 'artistic', 'equivalent', 'cotton', 'candy', 'What', 'found', 'instead', 'was', 'rarest', 'creatures', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'wonderful', 'production', 'values', 'entertains', 'actually', 'mind', 'posing', 'interesting', 'difficult', 'questions.Hugo', 'Weaving', 'more', 'voice', 'movements', 'most', 'actors', 'do', 'entire', 'toolkit', 'was', 'perfectly', 'cast', 'man', 'mask', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'excellent', 'reluctant', 'co-conspirator', 'drawn', 'V', 'world', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'downright', 'great', 'Chief', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'everyman', 'figure', 'who', 'must', 'sort', 'rubble', 'dislodge', 'truth', 'John', 'Hurt', 'be', 'channeling', 'William', 'Smith', '1984', 'soupcon', 'Hitler', 'frenzy', 'fury', 'are', 'thoroughly', 'convincing.What', 'film', 'so', 'brave', 'unusual', 'nervous', 'age', 'actually', 'terrorist', 'hero', 'heady', 'stuff', 'one', 'man', 'terrorist', 'man', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'V', 'interesting', 'blend', 'instant', 'karma', 'righteous', 'vengeance', 'social', 'idealism', 'motives', 'are', 'personal', 'understand', 'larger', 'context', 'handoff', 'Portman', 'finish', 'desire', 'Generals', 'create', 'world', 'where', 'children', 'can', 'study', 'philosophy.V', 'many', 'movies', 'superb', '2nd', 'act', 'Portman', 'time', 'faux', 'prison', 'powerful', 'epistolary', 'relationship', 'unseen', 'individual', 'one', 'cell', 'provide', 'film', 'compelling', 'underlying', 'humanity', 'Political', 'references', 'abound', 'V', 'do', 'film', 'references', 'serve', 'reinforce', 'core', 'idea', 'governments', 'really', 'are', 'created', 'serve', 'people', 'not', 'vice', 'versa', 'when', 'be', 'case', 'something', 'must', 'be', 'done', 'Perhaps', 'discomfort', 'surrounding', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'diminished', 'recalled', 'precisely', 'what', 'beloved', 'founding', 'fathers', 'did']",N/A

176178,AE8LL9S715YTE,1419838830,"Amazon Customer ""fbrobertson2""","[9, 38]","If V is for Vendetta and T is for Terrorism, what would the questions be?  This is not a critic of the film per say, but instead a critic of the worldview behind the movie.  So many times we accept the ""signals"" that we receive from radio, tv, internet, and other popular media, so much so that we fail at times to consider the worldview behind the signals.  Hence this review is not about the movie itself, which I will say is a good movie just like it was based upon a good comic book graphic novel.  Instead, I wish to examine, in this review, the worldview presented--a worldview (or set of worldviews) that we might not consider when we just sit back, eat our popcorn, and watch the silver screen.Where does heroism (with worldviews) end and terrorism (with worldviews) begin?  Who's to say that the terrorists of 9-11 are wrong, but the heroism of V from the movie is correct?  When is blowing up buildings ""good"" and when is it ""bad"", who's to say, you or I?  That is a strong and complicate question one that we must face today in this post-9-11 world that we live in, especially those of us who live in the United States, a place where so many times we forget just how volatile the world is outside our pristine middle class to upper middle class neighborhoods.  Even the most prayerful of us probably felt an unrealistic tug upon our hearts minds and souls when we watched 9-11 those, about six, years ago.  Now, after the towers fell, we see images of the aftermath, wars and rumors of wars going throughout the middle east, politicians going toe to toe either complimenting the war effort or condemning the war effort, either way using ""political talk"" (which to even the most intellectual of us, still can't be figured out).  Where does vendetta end and terrorism begin?  That is a problematic point this movie is trying to make in the worldview this movie is presenting.  Would it not be true to say that, several hundred years ago, our Founding Fathers and the men they commanded were seen as heroes to most of the colonists while seen as dastardly villains to most of England?  One man's hero is another man's cold blooded killer, no matter what flag or religion is being viewed...at least that is what this movie's worldview tries to speak.Yet there is something more problematic besides the ambiguous moral this movie presents to the many theater goers who are enjoying this movie.  It seems to blame, and I would guess that to a point this would be true, that religion and political ideals are the root cause of totalitarianism.  I know that I have heard people speaking against me in the media and internet because I am a Christian, but more to the point, people blaming Christians and all other religions as the reason for problems in this world (at least religions that are not politically correct and haven't gone by the PC checklist of groups like the ACLU).  I say this as someone who says of himself as being a fundamentalist Christian, that is someone who treats the Bible as THE Word of God and that the Bible presents truthfully that Jesus IS the Way, the Truth, and the Life.  Many people, and I think that in some sense being shown in the worldview of V for Vendetta, seem to think that all fundamentalist Christians, of whom I consider myself one of, all want to abolish and destroy everything from homosexuality to abortion clinics.  Which is strange because I've never gone out to abuse anyone who was going into a clinic despite the fact that yes I do consider myself prolife.  Why would I consider myself prolife and applaud those who wickedly bomb clinics?  That just doesn't make sense, but the ultraliberals of the country seem to place me in the same ""room"" as those who commit such crimes.  Same goes for homosexuality.  I have many gay friends who know that I have a very intricately woven belief system based upon what I have read and continue to read in the Bible.  Yet those same ultraliberals out there seem to say that I am in the same ""room"" as those who attack homosexuals.  Strange, but true, at least when you listen to the ultraliberal elites.Am I saying the movie is Anti-Bush like some other reviewers seem to gain from my review of the worldview behind V for Vendetta, well answer is, who knows besides the minds of the writers and directors themselves.  They may have a slant toward opposing Bush, but alike anyone else seeing the movie, we dont see a dart board with Bush's face on it being used in the local pub as a game of chance (that being darts).  Still, I think that the worldview toward a humanistic utopian is a cliche, that is the worldview that I am gathering from integrating both the comic book graphic novel and the movie itself, pulling together the woven pattern of thoughts and counter-thoughts.  The movie and book seems to suggest that faith and government (at least a conservative form of government) leads to totalitarianism.  Whether you agree or disagree that is yours to hold unto.  I merely, an observer, wish to bring up some thoughts that the movie has awakened unto me.Still.  Let us say that we do outlaw faith and we do end free enterprise and other such evils, at least what is being pointed out as being evil by this movie and many writers and speakers like Sam Harris who wrote the Christianphobic book, End of Faith, and many writers and speakers like Clint Willis who wrote the antiCapitalistic book, The I Hate Corporate America Reader.  Then what?  That is the world the movie V for Vendetta seems to look toward as a utopia.  V for Vendetta, I believe, just as the comic book that spawned the movie, longs for what I would have to say, a true and pure humanistic world ... but who would make the rules of this world and who would be the ones who followed such rules?  Just because you brought about a vacuum doesn't mean that the vacuum won't get stained by the fact that humans are, as the Bible shows, basically evil due to the Fall.  Does nature not abhor a vacuum?  What would take the place?  I would not be surprised to see, in this ""utopian"" world that so many people long for roving bands out to lynch anyone who said they believed that Jesus was their Savior, just like they would lynch anyone who would say that free enterprise brings about true economic growth.  Do we not see the lynching already taking place in our school systems and in our universities and in our politik speaks? Yes we do.  Thus, in the end I would have to say the worldview of V for Vendetta spawns more questions than answers, and with each examination of such questions to answers, a greater sense of foreboding and danger arises.",2,"V for Vendetta, T for Terrorism",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,6611,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'T', 'Terrorism', 'what', 'would', 'questions', 'be', 'not', 'critic', 'film', 'say',

His V is at once angry, bitter, vengeful, but also righteous, decent, gentlemanly and above all... tender.Both Evey and V grow throughout the movie, each learning from the other that right and wrong is not so clear cut as they originally thought, eventually coming to the realization that they alone cannot make choices for anyone other than themselves.Like all good love stories, this one is heart-breaking. The moment near the end, when Evey and V finally share a tender moment, Hugo Weaving's touching performance conveys the depth of the longing that V has for Evey.

The Novel has a comic adult sophistication with an amazing piece of full literature. But I will say if you've read the novel before watching this film get the book out of your head.V for Vendetta is set in London, Britain in the near-future has been through a nuclear war, an extreme fascist party has arisen called Norefire. This New Fascist Government in the year 2020 holds England in an Iron grip through fear and Propaganda. V who projects himself as Guy Fawkes in this film (Guy Fawkes goes down in English History as a revolutionary who plotted to blow up Parliament with gunpowder in 1605) In this film V is shown in different ways a terrorist to some, a freedom fighter to others, an Anarchist, a Monster, who has ideals. V had been imprisoned, tortured extreme, physical and mentally abused, after surviving he thinks he can bring about great ideas and change in society but on the other hand he has a vengeful vendetta to get back at what society has done to him, a very dark and complex character. V uses his thread of elaborate, theatrical, violence to bring down the government. Will he succeed?Well done to James Mcteigue who used lighting and angles to give the V mask layers of emotion.  Many serious issues weave through this film that makes you watch this wide eyed, and then out of the blue it lightens and pulls you into its comical/ironic side, it grabs attention, although this is based on a fictional world, fascism portrayed in this film is not far off the mark.

It's felt like a long time, especially due to the pushed back release date, but it was certainly worth it.V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel written by Alan Moore, who is generally considered to be one of the greatest comics writers of all time.  Moore's stories are known for their political intrigue and amazing ability to look at real-life situations in ways very few other forms of entertainment in any media can.  While the story has changed a little from the 1982 book, the 2006 film still captures the message perfectly.Set in London, England in the near future, it turns out things have gone very wrong in the world.  Due to the military advances of the United States, the world has suffered through a terrible nuclear war.  England is one of the few countries to survive, which is lucky for them, seeing as how they were allies of the US and aided in their military campaign.  For years, there was chaos and panic due to the lack of resources, and things didn't calm down until a new political party was able to come to power.  Led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the party promised peace and tranquility.  Unfortunately, in return for peace, the citiznes of England gave up their rights.  Quarantine zones were set up, curfews were enacted, and non-whites, gays, and non-Christians (anyone different) was deemed dangerous, rounded up, and taken away.  Furthermore, free speech, which includes political activism and speaking out against the government, was outlawed.  A secret police force was also set up.One evening, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) left her home after curfew and was assaulted by the secret police.  They planned on raping her, but a masked vigilante known only as V (Hugo Weaving) came to her rescue.  Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and black leather garments, V effortlessly took out the trio of cops using only knives and his knowledge of the martial arts.  It turns out that V is somewhat of a Batman-type character in the sense that he can effectively use simple weapons, karate, and manipulation of his surroundings to take out his enemies, but he has a definite political agenda.  V is tired of the fascism and means to bring about a better type of goverment.  Using extensive knowledge of the government's inner workings, explosives, and computer hacking skills, V is able to blow up the Old Bailey as well as hack into the media networks.As the story progresses, we slowly learn V's motivations for why he is doing what he is doing, while Chief Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), a respected party member, begins an investigation of his own as to who V is and what his motives are.It is interesting that, in today's world when the term terrorist is synonymous with evil, a movie whose ""protagonist"" is a terrorist would even be made.  However, one has to keep in mind that one man's terrorist is the freedom fighter of someone else (George Washington was most likely seen as a terrorist in the eyes of the British).  Still, V's tactics are brutal, and he is definitely not a hero.  The question that one must ask is how far one must go in pursuit of libery and justice.While there are a few things from the book that didn't make it into the film and there were a few story changes, the film more or less captures Moore's vision (though in the book, V explicitly states that he sought anarchy, while that isn't quite clear in the film).  The politics of this film may seem offensive to people at the extreme sides of the spectrum, but overall, it should intrigue most people.  And for the less politically-minded, it is also a great action film.

This may be the wrong take on the story but here's what I got from a first viewing.In V FOR VENDETTA (USA/UK/Germany-2005), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, black hat and cape plans to implode Westminster Palace as a way of getting out the truth to people being oppressed and controlled through a state-run TV network. At the end of a long, trying story on the stroke of midnight on November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day), a series of spectacular explosions fells the entire building along with Big Ben, while the coda of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture plays and a beautiful fireworks display lights up the night sky.And to think I saw this movie totally by accident during the overnight after July 4th, not knowing at all what would happen.

War, disease, discrimination and violence are at an all time high, especially in the U.K., which is under the control of the sadistic Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) and his secret police. Citizens of London have no basic freedoms. They are oppressed by their totalitarian government, almost brainwashed to a degree. Little do they know, one man is out to change all that.That man is a masked agent going by the name of V (played magnificently by Hugo Weaving). Inspired by the legendary Guy Fawkes, V is thought of a terrorist by many, as his tactics often involve endangering lives and going to great extremes to achieve liberation. When V saves the life of working class girl Evey Hammond (the always captivating Miss Natalie Portman), V offers her a chance to join him on his crusade for complete freedom. Evey, despite her odd attraction to this masked avenger with a great taste in the arts, is reluctant. She is not sure whether to view him as a hero or to share the viewpoint of those who view him as the villain. But when Evey realizes just how much the government has brought suffering to her fellow citizens (not to mention the memories of the loss of her family), Evey realizes V is the only symbol of freedom left in the world. She joins V, even after he manipulates, tricks and tortures her, because she knows no matter what, his methods are the last chance the world has got.Backed by an excellent supporting cast, ""V For Vendetta"" is not only one of the finest comic book movies ever made, but also scores actual merits as a movie in general. The storyline, the acting, the direction, and special effects are all top notch, and make ""V For Vendetta"" one of the first great cinematic triumphs of 21st century cinema.This two disc special edition is loaded with a stunning array of drool-worthy extras, including several documentaries as well as secret access to Natalie's uproarious gangsta-rap from ""Saturday Night Live"".

The consensus for those who oppose this film state that the movie promotes terrorism. On the other hand those who approve of it considered it opposing terrorism. Are either wrong or are they both right? Here's where I come in as a tie breaker. Inconvenient to the conservatives' vision is the very inception of our nation's history. For the early American Colonists to break free from the tyranny of King George, they were forced to fight back. That meant striking back, confronting the Red Coats and burning English ships. In other words, shooting British soldiers and blowing up property, thus ushering the American Revolution War.Many were killed, both Americans and British. Yet, the staunch conservatives of this nation applaud our robust history, giving birth to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. And yet these same conservatives are the first to oppose any form of dissent, quick to curtail our civil liberties. At the same time, beginning of our nation's history, America had had a public policy in opposing any or all despotic governments up to the present, case in point: Saddam's Iraq. To further my point, we need only to go generations' back to World War Two. The ""Axis of Evil"": Germany, Japan, and Italy posed a dire threat to the national security of the United States and Western Europe. In short, we ""bombed"" our enemies into submission--especially Japan. Millions were killed because of our actions. When opposing those who threaten our national security we Americans aren't too shy about the tactics we choose to defend ourselves. Iraq's ""Shock and Awe"" is one of many examples. Is the ""V"" character and his destruction of Parliament in the movie any different from the destruction we did in Berlin, Dresden, Tokyo, or Hiroshima?These events have become shrines to American freedom. If so how can one fault a ""freedom fighter"" who strikes back at his oppressors who now occupies his country in a liked manner? In ""V for Vendetta"" the British government gone rogue, who slaughtered families and destroyed communities, casualties by the tens of thousands to serve its ends and then sets-up concentration camps to conduct secret and illegal experiments on the ""politically-incorrect."" Is that why we resorted to unimaginable violence in order to stop the Nazis and the ""Tojos"" and found it acceptable, even praiseworthy? Why we praise the curtailing of our civil rights, ""pre-emptive strikes"" and ""extraordinary rendition?""  For V, violence of destruction wasn't the convenient solution but the only one left for him to stop the fascist and murdering dictatorship that had high jacked his country.

176198,A19VMQDCB4HZ9P,1419838830,"A. Sandoc ""sussarakhen""","[0, 2]","Alan Moore's decision to want his name off the final credits for the film adaptation of V for Vendetta now makes sense. Moore has had a hate/hate relationship with Hollywood and the film industry in general. They've taken two of his other works in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell and bollocks'd them up (to borrow a term used quite abit in V for Vendetta). Outside of Watchmen, Alan Moore sees V for Vendetta as one of his more personal works and after reading the screenplay adaptation of the graphic novel by The Wachowski Brothers his decision afterwards was to demand his name be removed from the film if it was ever made. Part of this was his hatred of the film industry for their past mistakes and another being his wish for a perfect adaptation or none at all. Well, V for Vendetta by James McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers is not a perfect film adaptation. What it turns out to be is a film that stays true to the spirit of Moore's graphic novel and given a modern, up-to-the-current news retelling of the world's state of affairs.V for Vendetta starts off with abit of a prologue to explain the relevance of the Guy Fawkes mask worn by V throughout the film and the significance of the date of the 5th of November. I think this change in the story from the source material may be for the benefit of audiences who didn't grow up in the UK and have no idea of who Guy Fawkes was and what his Gunpowder Plot was all about. The sequence is short but informative. From then on we move on to the start of the main story and here the film adheres close enough to the source material with a few changes to the Evey character (played with skill that more than makes up for her Amidala performances) but not enough to ruin the character. Caught after curfew and accosted by the ruling government's secret police called Fingermen, Evey soon encounters V who saves her not just from imprisonment but rape.Right from the start the one thing McTeigue and The Wachowski Brothers got dead-on was casting Hugo Weaving as the title character. Voice silky, velvety and sonorous, Weaving infuses V with an otherworldly, theatrical personality. Whether V was speaking phrases from Shakespeare, philosophers or pop culture icons, the voice gave a character who doesn't show his face from behind the enternally-smiling Guy Fawkes mask real life. I'd forgiven the makers of this films for some of the changes they made to the story and some of the characters for keeping V as close to how Moore wrote him. Once V and Evey are thrown in together by the happenstance of that nightly encounter their fates became intertwined. Portman plays the reluctant witness to V's acts of terrorism, murders and destruction in the beginning, but a poignant and emotionally powerful sequence to start the second half of the film soon brings Evey's character not much towards V's way of doing things, but to understanding just why he's doing them. This sequence became the emotional punch of the whole film and is literally lifted word for word from the graphic novel. I heard more than just a few people sobbing in the theater as the scenes and story unfolded.The rest of the cast seemed like a who's who of the British acting community. From Stephen Rea's stubborn and dogged Chief Inspector Finch whose quest to find V leads him to finding clues about his government's past actions that he'd rather have not found. Then there's Stephen Fry's flamboyant TV show host who becomes Evey's only other ally whose secret longings have been forbidden by the government, but who's awakened by V's actions to go through with his own form of rebellion. Then there's John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler who's seen chewing up the scenery with his Hitler-like performance through Big Brother video conferences (an ironic bit of casting since John Hurt also played Winston Smith in the film adaptation of the Orwell classic 1984). I really couldn't find any of the supporting players as having done a bad job in their performances. Even Hurt's Sutler may seemed over-the-top to some but his performance just showed how much of a hatemonger Sutler and in the end his Norsefire party really were in order to stay in power.The story itself, as I mentioned earlier, had had some changes made to it. Some of these changes angered Moore and probably anger his more die-hard fans. I count myself as one of these die-hards, but I know how film adaptations of classic literary works must and need to trim some of the fat from the main body and theme of the story to fully translate onto the silver screen. The Wachowski Brother's screenplay did just that. They trimmed some of the side stories and tertiary characters from the story and concentrated on V, Evey and Inspector Finch's pursuit of both and the truth. This adaptation is much closer to how Peter Jackson adapted The Lord of the Rings. As a fan of Moore I understood why he was unhappy with the changes. But then Moore is also an avowed perfectionist and only a perfect adaptation would do.Already critics on both sides of the aisle have called V for Vendetta revolutionary, subversive, daring to irresponsible, propagandist. All because the film dares to ask serious questions about the nature and role of violence as a form of dissent. But the granddaddy question the film brings up that has people talking is the question: terrorist or freedom fighter? Is V one or the other or is he both? Make no mistake about it, V for all intents and purposes is a terrorist if one was to use the definition of what a terrorist is. The makers of this film goes to great lenghts to describe throughout the film just how Sutler and his Norsefire (with its iconic Nazi-like symbols and fundamentaist Christian thinking) party rose to power in the UK. Partly due to what seemed like the failed US foreign policy and its subsequent and destructive decline as a superpower and the worldwide panic and fear it began as a result. V for Vendetta also ask just who was to blame for allowing such individuals to rule over them. V has his reasons for killing these powers-that-be, but he also points out that people really should just look in the mirror if they need to know who really was to blame. For it was the population --- whose desire to remain safe and have a semblance of peace --- gave up more and more of their basic liberties and rights for a return to order. If one was to look at the past 100 years they would see that it's happened before. There was the regime of Pol Pot in Cambodia, Milosevic's Greater Serbia, and the king of the hill of them all being Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Inner Circle.Another thing about V for Vendetta that will surely talked about alot will be the images used in the film. Not just images and symbols looking so much like Nazi icons, but images from the current events sweeping the globe that has been shown time and time again in the news and written about in magazines and newspapers. The film shows people bound and hooded like prisoners from Abu Ghraib. The reason of the war on terror used time and time again by Sutler to justify why England and its people need him and his group to protect them by any means necessary. V for Vendetta seems like a timely film for our current times. Even with the conclusion of the film finally accomplishing what Guy Fawkes failed to do that night of November 5th some 400 plus years ago, V for Vendetta doesn't give all the answers to all the questions it raises. For some I'm sure this would be something that'll frustrate them. So much of people who go to watch thought-provoking films want their questions answered as clearly as possible and all of them. V for Vendetta doesn't answer them but gives the audience enough information to try and work it out themselves.In final analysis, V for Vendetta accomplishes in bringing the main themes of Alan Moore's graphic novel to life and even does it well despite some of the changes made. It is a film that is sure to polarize the extreme left and right of the political pundits and commentators. But as a piece of thought-provoking and even as a politically subversive film, V for Vendetta does it job well. It is not a perfect film by any respect, but the story and message it tries to convey in addition to its value as a piece of entertainment mor than makes up for its flaws. V for Vendetta more than continues the current crop of seriously done comic book fillm adaptations (Batman Begins, X2, Sin City, and A History of Violence) but it also shows that Alan Moore's work can be adapted well to the screen when given to the right people. It may not be perfect and it may not make Alan Moore happy, but it comes close and more than makes up for LXG and From Hell.",5,"Powerful, subversive and thoughtful adaptation of Moore's classic

176208,A2ATWKOFJXRRR1,1419838830,"B. Merritt ""filmreviewstew.com""","[5, 11]","A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own ""good"" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!)Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V.

Without losing an inescapable sense of reality, the creators of the Matrix have managed to bring to the screen a futuristic world that leaves audiences thinking.As a summary, V for Vendetta tells the story of pretty Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman trying to stay inconspicuous in the frightening London of the future.  However, during a late-night, dark-alley attack, she is saved by V, a masked terrorist that, for some reason, intrigues her.  When V blows up ""The Bailey"", a building in the heart of London, later that night, the government's police forces suspect Evey to have been privy to the plot.  Later, V holds the most-watched and government-sanctioned television network (called BTC) hostage and addresses the nation.  He asks England's citizens to rally against their corrupt government on the next November the 5th.  During the months preceding November the 5th, Evey becomes enmeshed in V's plans and the conspiracies and corruption of the government.  As the film progresses, the audience becomes increasingly aware of V's dark past and the secret that has brought the government to power and which it will kill to keep.I am sure that other reviewers will say that this movie sanctions terrorism.  V for Vendetta, however, is a powerful film simply because it makes the audience think about terrorism and our world on a completely different level.  The scary part about this movie is that V and Evey's world does not seem so detached from our own.  It has a certain and eerie that-could-actually-happen quality.This is one of the first movies that I have seen in a long time that made me reflect so much on real-world issues.

In the original comic, England is one of few countries that have survived a nuclear fall out only to be run by a power hungry, right-wing extremist group. The movie adaptation by the Wachowski brothers wisely changes the post-Cold War/nuclear fallout scenario into that of a post-9/11 world filled with paranoia a la 1984, conspiracy, biochemical warfare, terrorism, and propaganda on a scale not seen since Hitler; the result is eerie and unsettling, effective in that it portrays a reality that isn't all that far removed from our own. Through the eyes of the female protagonist Evey (Natalie Portman), we explore the morality (or amorality) of the terrorist acts of V (Hugo Weaving) and whether the ends of his goals really justify the means. The emotions of Evey and rationalizations of V are played masterfully in the hands of Portman and Weaving making Evey's physical and emotional torment very real and V's philosophical ravings balance delicately on the edge of insanity. While the acting all around is top notch, the real stand out performance of the movie (as it should be) is that of Hugo Weaving--we never once see V's face and yet rarely is a character so affecting as this masked hero. The production of the film seems to be one long line of great decisions, among them John McTeigue's decision not to turn V into a simple action movie. The action scenes are neatly trimmed for efficiency and emotional impact; they occur at just the right times and never become bloated or stale. Perhaps best of all is that the audience leaves the movie excitedly discussing the messages of the film more than anything else, something that ought to happen far more often.",4,V For Vendetta (4.5 stars),1160006400,"10 5, 2006",2006,1812,"['Based', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'classic', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'look', 'dystopian', 'not-so-distant', 'future', 'England', 'original', 'comic', 'England', 'one', 'few', 'countries', 'have', 'survived', 'nuclear', 'fall', 'only', 'be', 'run', 'power', 'hungry', 'right-wing', 'extremist', 'group', 'movie', 'adaptation', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'wisely', 'post-Cold', 'War/nuclear', 'fallout', 'scenario', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'filled', 'paranoia', 'la', '1984', 'conspiracy', 'biochemical', 'warfare', 'terrorism', 'propaganda', 'scale', 'not', 'seen', 'Hitler', 'result', 'eerie', 'unsettling', 'effective', 'reality', ""n't"", 'far', 'removed', 'own', 'eyes', 'female', 'protagonist', 'Evey', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'explore', 'morality', 'amorality', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'V', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'ends', 'goals', 'really', 'justify', 'means', 'emotions', 'Evey', 'rationalizations', 'V', 'are', 'played', 'masterfully', 'hands', 'Portman', 'Weaving', 'making', 'Evey', 'physical', 'emotional', 'torment', 'very', 'real', 'V', 'philosophical', 'ravings', 'balance', 'delicately', 'edge', 'insanity', 'acting', 'around', 'top', 'notch', 'real', 'stand', 'performance', 'movie', 'should', 'be', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'never', 'once', 'see', 'V', 'face', 'yet', 'rarely', 'character', 'so', 'affecting', 'masked', 'hero', 'production', 'film', 'be', 'one', 'long', 'line', 'great', 'decisions', 'John', 'McTeigue', 'decision', 'not', 'turn', 'V', 'simple', 'action', 'movie', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'neatly', 'trimmed', 'efficiency', 'emotional', 'impact', 'occur', 'just', 'right', 'times', 'never', 'become', 'bloated', 'stale', 'Perhaps', 'best', 'audience', 'movie', 'excitedly', 'discussing', 'messages', 'film', 'more', 'anything', 'else', 'something', 'ought', 'happen', 'far', 'more', 'often']",N/A

In fact I believe he might be turning in his grave right now, that this juvenile, nasty trash might be promoted in his name.As a British viewer, this film really jarred with me. Ok, there are lots of explosions, lots of violence, lots of cool allusions to the war on terror, lots of smart references to fuddy duddy old white people and their prejudices and consequently lots of fuddy duddy old white people being brutally killed by our hero. Hey, we even have a dirty old catholic priest character asking if Natalie Portman in kneesocks and pigtails 'is too old', ignoring of course that 99% of the Catholic abuse victims have been boys.

V(Hugo Weaving) rescues Evey at the start of the movie from a few punks & at that point, I was confused cause I wasn't sure if he was a bad guy or a good guy having knowing nothing about the movie before I watched it other then the fact that Natalie Portman was in it of course. then he rescues her after killing many cops in which was basically blood bath after she watches him blow up a building & the movie has taken a dramatic turn. She's now his prisoner & he plans to continue his attacks of revenge against the government. V is an extremely experienced killer while no one knows his real name & we never see his face. but all his points against the government are valid & though I don't agree with him killing everyone as the solution, its his motivation that make this movie so different & so much fun! Of Evey(Natalie) escapes from the killer & they don't exactly become enemies as he keeps trying to get her to be like him & since they are still friends, sorta anyway, something happens with the both of them & they fall in love! & the final question is, will this effect Evey's decision at the end of the movie?

176224,A2E3F04ZK7FG66,1419838830,calvinnme,"[3, 7]","I wouldn't say this is a great movie, but at least it took some chances. The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood these days. However, it does seem obvious that the movie is taking swipes at the Bush administration and its supporters, which is not exactly a brave or bold position in Hollywood, or anywhere else for that matter.The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.However, if you can suspend your beliefs as to what is the most likely future of particular western countries, this is a pretty good movie.",4,Got to give it credit for taking chances,1155168000,"08 10, 2006",2006,2043,"['would', ""n't"", 'say', 'great', 'movie', 'least', 'took', 'chances', 'idea', 'terrorist', 'popular', 'hero', 'irony', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'played', 'Winston', '1984', 'playing', 'dictator', 'further', 'irony', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'who', 'played', 'terrorist', 'Crying', 'Game', 'playing', 'relentless', 'cop', 'who', 'now', 'hunting', 'terrorist', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'were', 'braver', 'ideas', 'am', 'accustomed', 'seeing', 'coming', 'Hollywood', 'days', 'However', 'seem', 'obvious', 'movie', 'taking', 'swipes', 'Bush', 'administration', 'supporters', 'not', 'exactly', 'brave', 'bold', 'position', 'Hollywood', 'anywhere', 'else', 'matter.The', 'acting', 'commendable', 'good', 'see', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'given', 'chance', 'take', 'more', 'challenging', 'role', 'was', 'given', 'part', 'Star', 'Wars', 'where', 'rest', 'cast', 'saw', 'lots', 'action', 'had', 'little', 'opportunity', 'act', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'had', 'real', 'challenge', 'project', 'personality', 'Halloween', 'mask', 'wore', 'film', 'mere', 'body', 'language', 'inflection', 'voice', 'think', 'was', 'challenge', 'met', 'admirably.I', 'guess', 'one', 'thing', 'really', 'bothered', 'was', 'basic', 'premise', 'film', 'Having', 'just', 'read', 'Europe', 'Slept', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'United', 'States', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'self', 'destructing', 'ever', 'managing', 'be', 'more', 'politically', 'correct', 'country', 'Europe', 'including', 'Great', 'Britain', 'also', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'religious', 'fundamentalism', 'would', 'ever', 'take', 'root', 'England', 'language', 'ways', 'would', 'seem', 'foreign', 'almost', 'entire', 'citizenry', 'entire', 'continent', 'Europe', 'been', 'post-Christian', 'era', 'last', 'one', 'hundred', 'years', 'Nobody', 'Europe', 'would', 'even', 'understand', 'what', 'dictator', 'was', 'talking', 'when', 'delivered', 'one', 'religious', 'rants', 'might', 'as', 'well', 'be', 'reciting', 'Shakespeare', 'backwards.However', 'can', 'suspend', 'beliefs', 'what', 'most', 'likely', 'future', 'particular', 'western', 'countries', 'pretty', 'good', 'movie']",N/A

What it really is is a bad movie with a dangerous message, and I cannot wonder but to think that Wachowski simply didn't know what he was doing; that in an effort to make a ""hip"" action flick, he instead produced a terrorist-propaganda film.The main character ""V"" decides that he will not go to the people with his message of revolution.  Instead, he will assassinate political leaders and bomb buildings.  Natalie Portman's character is kidnapped by him and essentailly tortured, until she ""believes"" in his political endeavors.  All of this is slickly presented and dressed up to be something other than what it is -reeducation, torture, murder.  It's the political method of Mao and Pol Pot given an MTV makeover.To make matters worse, Wachowski hits us over the head with sanctimonious messages from the darkest days of political correctness and campus speech codes.  At one point, we are told a lengthy story of two lesbians who are brutally persecuted because of their sexual preference.  In another scene, William Hurt gives a little speech about how the Quran is now illegal.  The Anglican Bishop is a vicious child-molester.  Christianity is openly condemned throughout the film.  It is so over-the-top that it smacks of film-school amatuerism.This movie has the philosophical depth of an 8th grader's book report on ""Animal Farm.""

176237,A18G7GG53G2X8A,1419838830,Chris Pandolfi,"[13, 22]","""V For Vendetta"" did something I didn't think a contemporary Anti Establishment movie could do: it instilled compassion for a murderer and made me agree with acts of terrorism. In today's day and age, it's easy to see why that would be hard to accomplish, considering how inhumane most terrorism is. This movie has a way of blurring the line between a nonviolent conscience and a radical need for change, and the fact that it was able to do that fascinated me on so many levels. There are a couple of people to thank for this: first and foremost there are Alan Moore and David Lloyd for creating the original graphic novel; then there are the Wachowski Brothers for adapting the graphic novel into a screenplay; and then there's James McTeigue for his direction.Of course, the cast has to be thanked as well, most notably Hugo Weaving for his incredibly effective portrayal of the shadowy bandit known only as V. What we're shown is a classic antihero character, completely and appropriately surrounded by an air of mystery (which is obviously helped by the fact that he's never seen without wearing a Guy Fawkes mask). It's very much safe to assume that he's not quite normal, both mentally and physically; he seems invincible from the way he fights, but more so, he seems incredibly cultured, not only from his expanded vocabulary, but from his interest in theater and film, as well (he's quite fond of the movie ""The Count of Monte Cristo""). The only concrete insight we're given concerns one major event from his past, an event that completely shapes him into a vengeful yet important instigator of society. I dare not say what that event was, nor do I dare say whom he wishes to hunt down and destroy. But rest assured it's one of the most pivotal plot devices in this movie.A lot of ideas presented have been used before: this is a futuristic story (although it's the not-too-distant future) about a totalitarian government and the rebel who decides to take a stand against it. Even though that aspect is fairly unoriginal (all you have to do is read George Orwell's ""1984"" or see Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" to see what I mean), the way ""V For Vendetta"" is told completely makes up for it, especially since it sends a message that a lot of people need to hear. That's probably why it wasn't surprising that the filmmakers included a cop (Stephen Rea as Chief Inspector Finch) who starts out loyal but gradually rethinks everything he's been told to believe. Hints of the Holocaust were added to the mix, as well, and that to me was even less surprising.The not-too-distant future we're presented shows us England under the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). It's a heavily regimented society formed from the devastation of disease and the collapse of major governments (our country is referred to as the Former United States). Maybe that's why Sutler is practically never seen in person; he's a ruler whose face is almost exclusively seen on a greatly oversized television screen (which I'm sure was an intentional tribute to Orwell's Big Brother character). To say he has absolute control over the country would be an understatement; political opposition, homosexuality, and religious freedom are all illegal and punishable by death. (Does any of this seem overwhelmingly familiar?)The vast majority of the population is complacent and fearful. We frequently sees shots of regular families in their living rooms watching their TVs, witnessing the government's propaganda in the form of falsified news bulletins and religious banter (delivered with style by Roger Allam as the despicable Lewis Prothero). You can see the anger and sadness in their eyes as they're being lied to from their own people. At the same time, you can see the unwillingness to do something about it; anyone who's ever faced a dilemma knows the agony of not rocking the boat when they know they should.Things get interesting when we meet Evey (Natalie Portman, who can finally fake a decent British accent). Her past is about as dark and painful as you might expect, and as a result, she has some intense but reserved feelings about the government. She's introduced to V in a back alley after some corrupt police officers attempt to rape her. Right away it becomes obvious that the two were meant to be allies. It's also obvious that she is intrigued yet suspicious of his beliefs and methods. What are not so obvious are his feelings for her, and they remain elusive throughout the film; he's accommodating and witty while at the same time overpowering and distant. These conflicting personalities were eventually foremost in my mind, especially after Evey is kidnapped, questioned, and tortured (but to find out why, you'll have to see the movie).Some may be offended by ""V For Vendetta""'s unapologetic views on oppression and freedom, and they certainly have the right to feel that way. Nevertheless, I truly feel that this is one of the most relevant films of the year, especially given the issues and controversies we continuously see in the world. It's by no means just a stylized action thriller, as the television commercials may lead some to believe. Underneath it all, it's trying to convey a serious political message, one that doesn't have to be believed so much as it does have to be heard.",5,V For Very Important,1142553600,"03 17,

With him is Evey, a young woman whose had more than her share of problems who can't figure out whether action does create results, even if said action involves killing and explosions.Remember how after 9/11, certain songs or movies were kind of banned for awhile? Then there was that Simpsons episode where Homer goes to the Towers looking for a washroom that got taken off the air? Well Vendetta certainly picked a worst(or better, depending on your viewpoint) time to come out since anything involving terrorism gets people up in arms. I find governments have the ability to go deaf at will, oblivious to people's cries for help until they decide action should be taken. Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist. Well, blowing up Parliament or the White House certainly isn't a good idea to create change, it's sad that something of that magnitude in some form has to happen before people realize ""hey, we ARE getting screwed here!""How is the film? Well, it's got problems really. It starts out fine but then it hits the hour mark and while it doesn't slam on the brakes, the gas is definately running out. I'm not an action junkie but I'd like something of substance to happen and unfortunately it just kind of goes. Acting-wise though the film is quite good with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the latter being very charismatic even just through voice. But like in Lord of the Rings, I can't help but think he's gonna bust out a ""Mr. Anderson..."" at any moment.Extras-wise it's incredibly disappointing. There was more featurettes on my one disc Serenity then there was on this thing. Expect another release sometime in the future I bet. The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies.",4,"It's good in that kind of ""it didn't waste my time"" way",1155686400,"08 16, 2006",2006,2646,"['anticipating', 'movie', 'so', 'long', 'sudden', 'found', 'not', 'wanting', 'watch', 'could', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'was', 'negative', 'press', 'controversy', 'fact', 'read', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', ""n't"", 'big', 'fan', 'still', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'watching', 'actually', 'certainly', 'admirable', 'film', 'one', 'really', 'easy', 'found', 'hard', 'love.We', ""'re"", 'Orwellian', '1984', '-esque', 'England', 'where', 'government', 'everything', 'microphones', 'cameras', 'are', 'everywhere', 'religious', 'texts', 'are', 'banned', 'dissenters', 'often', 'disappear', 'Leading', 'fight', 'freedom', 'V', 'man', 'mask', 'inspired', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'who', 'knives', 'down', 'key', 'members', 'government', 'plans', 'blow', 'up', 'Parliament', 'Evey', 'young', 'woman', 'had', 'more', 'share', 'problems', 'who', 'ca', ""n't"", 'figure', 'out', 'action', 'create', 'results', 'even', 'said', 'action', 'killing', 'explosions.Remember', 'how', '9/11', 'certain', 'songs', 'movies', 'were', 'kind', 'banned', 'awhile', 'Then', 'was', 'Simpsons', 'episode', 'where', 'Homer', 'Towers', 'looking', 'washroom', 'got', 'taken', 'off', 'air', 'Well', 'Vendetta', 'certainly', 'picked', 'worst', 'better', 'depending', 'viewpoint', 'time', 'come', 'out', 'anything', 'involving', 'terrorism', 'people', 'up', 'arms', 'find', 'governments', 'have', 'ability', 'go', 'deaf', 'will', 'oblivious', 'people', 'cries', 'help', 'decide', 'action', 'should', 'be', 'taken', 'Standing', 'front', 'tree', 'once', 'year', 'saying', 'environment', 'good', 'not', 'make', 'environmentalist', 'Well', 'blowing', 'up', 'Parliament', 'White', 'House', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'good', 'idea', 'create', 'change', 'sad', 'something', 'magnitude', 'form', 'happen', 'people', 'realize', 'hey', 'ARE', 'getting', 'screwed', 'here', 'How', 'film', 'Well', 'got', 'problems', 'really', 'out', 'fine', 'then', 'hour', 'mark', ""n't"", 'slam', 'brakes', 'gas', 'definately', 'running', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'action', 'junkie', ""'d"", 'like', 'something', 'substance', 'happen', 'unfortunately', 'just', 'kind', 'Acting-wise', 'film', 'quite', 'good', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'latter', 'being', 'very', 'charismatic', 'even', 'just', 'voice', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'think', 'gon', 'bust', 'out', 'Mr.', 'Anderson', 'moment.Extras-wise', 'incredibly', 'disappointing', 'was', 'more', 'featurettes', 'one', 'disc', 'Serenity', 'then', 'was', 'thing', 'Expect', 'release', 'sometime', 'future', 'bet', 'film', 'same', 'time', 'reasons', ""n't"", 'fact', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'are', 'certainly', 'up', 'last', '2', 'Matrix', 'movies']",N/A

Yet, I wonder why disowned his name from the credits of the movie. Perhaps it's because the original graphic novel from which the movie was based upon was not only about the message that the masked hero delivered but it was also a little bit more about exploring what V (the character himself) was really all about.  Because by reading the graphic novel and then seeing the movie there were obivous chages made to the original story, but you can tell that the movie didn't spend as much time on the V character like the graphic novel did but it was more about the message that V delivered.  It would be very interesting to hear Alan Moore talk about his reason for not being involved in the movie.

176246,A1LMQHB3ZANNVN,1419838830,C. Oliver,"[17, 27]","V, brillantly acted by Hugo Weaving, is not the story of a terrorist who believes that blowing things up is the only answer.  It is not the story of a person that claims to have all the answers.  It's not the story of a person whose plans are all noble, but the story of a person who wants vengeance, and who sees something horrible in the world and wants to change it.  Violence is not an answer some contractors and critics of the show say.  Violence is not an answer?  Is not AMerica's freedom one by violence?  Did we not liberate a country by blowing up bombs, and sending soldiers with guns.  Do we not have our own Vendettas?V is our second Amendent.  V is to represent the ability all humans, and citizens of a country should have, not to be afraid of their government but for their government to be afraid of them.  If a government has power, you can not beat them in the press.  You can only outrage a public so much that they will join you in a violent overthrow.  Because if you believe a dictator will say that because the masses are quietly and contently protesting that he will resign I pitty, and sad and lost world that will inhabit.  If you believe that Sedition and Censorship are good, and that people who challange the religious ideals, in search of there happiness are bad, then maybe you'd find yourself at home in 2020 Britian.  If you believe that a government shouldn't answer for it's crimes.  That a government doesn't have to answer to it's people.  And that your government can be trusted.  You haven't done your history very well.Hitler, Stalin, 1919 Seditions Act, Containment Centers for the Chinese, Kings, QUeens, Hussien.  This is what blind obedience of your government causes.  Hitler had to be overthrown with violence.  Kings were overthrown, Queens were overthrown, Hussien was overthrown, The Tabliban was overthrown.People might say that this praises anarchy.  Anarchy is chaos, because we believe that people cannot be trusted.  People given freedom will be corrupted by that freedom, and for the most part it is true.  But I can only hope that the world, given a choice between, Censorsip and Sedition, Controling Government, Dictatorship, the Dissmissal of privacy, and the dissmisal of freedom, or Anarcy, people Anarchy.  Let me remind you of a woman named Margaret Garner, who instead of allowing her babies to be taken back for slavery, she murdered them.  Let me remind you of Nat Turner, who was hung, was tried and found guilty, who led a revolt against the government of the South because it wasn't right.  Benjamin Franklin once said that ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.""  And that is the case we deal with in V's world.  It is safer to live under the governments rule and not fight, and not argue, and not do anything.  It is safer... but freedom is not meant to be safe.  Freedom means death, freedom means murder and hate, freedom means love and expression, freedoms danger and uncertainty, and freedom means Power and Individuality.V isn't a coward because he hides behind a mask, he's deformed for one reason, and he's trying to last longer than the man who thought there would be no punishment.  Anarchist and a Terrorist, you know, I wonder what people think America is in Iraq, the Iraqi citizens whose children have been firebombed, whose mothers have been burnt to death, or whose fathers or husband or wives or grandparents, or grandchildren have been killed by American bombs.  Or these people who have been left defenseless against the Tyranny that still exist as we try to force our views down their throats, and the voice of opposition is continually silenced.  If all of a sudden, ten thousand people Marched down Iraqi streets, we would lose this war completely.  If they stood together, if they chose to no longer allow us we would be the enemy.  WE aren't yet, but that's luck.  V united a people in his time against a true evil.  An evil the people came to accept for fear of death.

This and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs; when he first appears he is a protector.""-PlatoIn the 1980s comic books took a revolutionary turn (one the likes of which had not been seen since the `60s and `70s) and became politically and socially relevant again. These were the days of conservative and consumerist values, when Ronald Reagan was president and Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister. A Cold War was being fought and the lines between freedom fighter and terrorist, democracy and imperialism were quickly dissipating. It was in this political climate that David Lloyd and Alan Moore createdV for Vendetta, a highly intelligent graphic novel series. V for Vendetta was brilliantly written and illustrated and helped to prove that comic books weren't just for children; they were literature. The film V for Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel and was written by the Wachowski Brothers (the Matrix Trilogy).""As in private life one differentiates between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does, so in historical struggles one must still more distinguish the language and the imaginary aspirations of parties from their real organism and their real interests, their conception of themselves from their reality.""-Karl MarxIn a bleak totalitarian future, Britain has become a cesspool for corruption, conformity and brutality. People's civic rights are being severely violated by the government, under the leadership of Chancellor Sutler. The people are misguided, apathetic, and fearful of the harsh regime that rules over them but that's about to change. One night a young woman named Evey is caught by corrupt police officers after curfew. They intend to rape her but astonishingly (or predictably, if you're a comic book expert) she is saved by a costumed vigilante, who wears an antiquated mask ofGuy Fawkes. His name is V and he has a deep hatred of the current government, a hatred that was born when he was tortured and experimented upon. He invites Evey to join him on the rooftops fro a ""concerto"" which he will conduct himself. Reluctantly she agrees to go and there she watches in shock and amazement as V detonates the Old Bailey. The next day a police squad is sent to obtain her for questioning but V shows up and saves her... sort of. He takes her back to his underground lair where he makes her breakfast and asks her to join him in his revolution. She agrees but only does so with the intention of escaping. V uses Evey to gain access to his targets but she manages to get away. Soon she is caught and arrested. She spends months in a small gloomy cell being tortured and interrogated before she is released and learns to master her fear. Meanwhile Chancellor Sutler increases his power over the population by overwhelming them with misinformation in the media. He utilizes scare tactics and military force to keep any dissidents in line but the people grow quietly more rebellious. V has promised them a revolution will commence on November the 5th and he has planned to liberate them and avenge those who have been wronged. But is he a lunatic or a hero, a guerrilla freedom fighter or a monstrous killer? Maybe he is all of those things as well as being the only hope for ending Chancellor Sutler's wicked regime... and yet at what cost?""One who breaks an unjust law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.""-Martin Luther King, Jr.The film is skillfully directed by newcomer James McTeigue and features an amazing cast including Hugo Weaving as V, Natalie Portman as Evey, and John Hurt as Chancellor Sutler. Other cast members include Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, Roger Allam and Sinead Cusack.V for Vendetta is a disquieting film, a film that is thought provoking and questions authority. It daringly asks questions about the world in which we live but it leaves us to find the answers. The film is understandably controversial, especially in the age of terrorism, distortion in the media, genocide, biochemical warfare and rampant political corruption. The story shows us the dangers of combining religious fanaticism, puritanical thinking, and social intolerance while handing the government complete control. The film certainly won't appeal to many conservatives or centralists. It's an extreme film that attacks extreme problems. Even Alan Moore disassociated himself from it, feeling that the screenplay was not faithful to his story*.

Bush smear and your hero as a self-justified terrorist who believes that destroying symbolic infrastructure will somehow revive a moribund culture and that swords are more effective than guns, well, this movie might be for you.I watched the movie because I am a fan of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (and I didn't think it was possible that the brothers who made the first Matrix could make a worse movie than Matrix 3, but I was wrong).  Portman and Weaving both do the best they can with the handicaps they are given (such as an idiotic plot and pretty weak dialogue), but ultimately their talents are wasted.John Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.  The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.  It thinks that they yell and scream and threaten and kill everyone indiscriminately.  Really, they have to combine murder with a kind of charisma and off-balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.  Anyway, Hurt is certainly what the script asks him to be, but the character is a waste of his abilities.Weaving only gets to use his voice and I am not sure he was ever the body wearing the mask.  If he was, why?  He is not needed under the mask anymore than James Earl Jones had to wear the Darth Vader costume to create such a memorable character.  There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.  He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.The best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).  He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.  However, here it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.The Wachowski brothers have traded on a cheap kind of paranoia that resonates with their audience, but this one is incredibly dumb.  If you actually believe that political leaders can make reality out of media messages despite what is actually happening in the real world, well, this movie will seem like a documentary, I guess.  But I would then feel sorry for you and encourage you to get some help.  Each movie these brothers have made since the first Matrix has gotten weaker and more pathetic.  Maybe it is time to turn off their money spigot.  Of course that won't happen because they turned $50 million into $130 million at the box office plus all the DVD sales and rentals to people like me.Oh, well.",3,"If you like implausible paranoid fantasies, this might be for you.

176257,A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH,1419838830,"Damian Gunn ""The Dark One is I""","[4, 7]","`V' opened to critical acclaim as well as critical controversy.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and even after its DVD release it's taken me months to give it a look.  I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.  `V' just never got around to grabbing my interest the way I expected it to, and with all the `Matrix' comparisons I expected a little more in the action department, but the film is sorely lacking in that area as well.The film circles around a terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who is disgusted with the country's current situation.  England is under the rule of Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who rules by instilling fear in the eyes of the nation.  V happens upon young Evey (Natalie Portman) who unwillingly becomes his prodigy, but when a close friend is murdered at the hands of the government she becomes a little more willing to help make a statement.That's precisely what this movie tries to do, make a statement, but it falls short of a memorable one.  The acting too was a bit of a sore spot.  Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier...the audience has no chance to read your face and know your phony.  Portman to me was a huge disappointment.  She seemed miscast and slightly out of her element.  She showed so much promise with `Closer' that I expected her to really soar here and I was sadly let down.The action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.  The movie tries really hard to make a point, to have a moral backdrop but it just doesn't come across on the screen.  I've read that Alan Moore (the writer of the graphic novel of which this movie is based) was not pleased with the film.  I've never read his novel, but I can assume (since Hollywood has a really bad problem with this) that it was drastically changed for the big screen.  Either way, I don't really understand all the hype, but this film does have it's supporters.

176260,A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ,1419838830,"Daniel Jolley ""darkgenius""","[1, 7]","Despite some deficiencies in the plot, V for Vendetta makes for a fantastic, refreshingly different kind of motion picture.  The controversy surrounding the film was blown out of proportion, but it's easy to see why it could raise hackles in some quarters.  It's really the old terrorist vs. freedom fighter question which has taken on such an important place in modern society.  Despite a jab here or there at the United States, I don't think the film really makes any statement at all along today's geopolitical lines - due in no small part to the story's fantastical setting.  We all know never to say ""it can't happen here,"" but I for one can certainly never foresee a blatantly fascist society with its very own Hitlerian demagogue emerging in, of all places, England.  Clearly, at least to me, the questions this film raises are quite abstract and not directly applicable to current events vis-&agrave;-vis the war on terror.  As an eye-opening reminder of the possibility of governmental abuse of power, however, the film's warning stands us all in good stead.The setting for this film is a futuristic England, wherein a fiery egomaniac and his cronies have usurped power and brought a hard iron fist down on the people.  Freedom of ideas and expression no longer exists; minority groups have been decimated by imprisonment, torture, and death; and militaristic nationalism has become the new religion.  Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation-state.  The illusion of peace is broken by one man, however - one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.  V wears the mask of the infamous Guy Fawkes, but his message is more than symbolic.  For twenty years, he has worked for this moment in time, intent on meting out justice and vengeance on those who wronged him personally and the body politic as a whole.  His tactics are certainly questionable, but his motivations are unimpeachable.It's all too easy to get bogged down in the question as to V's nature - be it terrorist or freedom fighter.  Unfortunately, the question must be asked and has been asked by some who condemn the film for glorifying terrorism.  To my eyes, he's clearly a terrorist - and a freedom fighter.  One has to look at the whole picture, though.  Here, we can see that the government V seeks to destroy is unquestionably evil.  Does that make it okay for V to employ tactics of murder and widespread destruction?  That's for each viewer to decide.  It's difficult to judge a man who does the wrong things for the right reasons.  It's even harder to carry that sort of thinking further, but it's healthy for individuals to ponder such questions, especially as humanity has a long tradition of learning nothing from history.Back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.  Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).  The character of Evey was quite a challenge, but Portman makes you doubt that any other actress could have played her.  Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.  Hugo Weaving is mysteriously majestic as the man behind the mask, giving unassailable substance to a character who could have easily come across as cartoonish.  Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.

Or since we're discussing poor Jimmy McTeigue's awkward, mind-numbingly dull lobotomy of Alan Moore's brilliant and haunting ""V for Vendetta""---and since it's set in not-so-jolly-old-England in the hazy, crazy future---then, in the spirit of the Cockney dialect why don't we just call it ""F for Foooking Awful""?Try  ""B for Bowdlerized"": the cinematic ""V"" is one plopped into the digital blender and stripped of its drama, boiled down, recycled, pureed, bled dry of its horrible irony and all too balefully human black heart.McTeigue cut his teeth setting up the slick action shots for the Matrix flicks, and it shows: in ""V"" there is a doozy of a fight sequence, and it's a bracing example of what the flick might have been---balletic, nimble, unapologetically brutal, almost graceful.But then McTeigue---and his well-heeled handlers, the gender-bending Wachowskis---get down to business: sticking it to G.W. Bush and those fiendish Americans!The story, which needed no fiddling, is fiddled with, the better to make Hugo Weaving's black-hatted Hamlet a white-helmeted paragon of Freedom: the sinister, blighted landscape of post-Apocalyptic Britain at the guts of the graphic novel is replaced by a UK gone fascist after a bout of nasty pox. Evey is no longer a prostitute, with nowhere to turn: now she's a pert, preppy, abs-and-thighs of steel -production assistant.And so: gone is the dark, wicked, twisted, nimble brilliance of Alan Moore's sinister diptych set in a post-apocalyptic totalitarian England, replaced by something that plays like a ""V"" Cliff's Notes for the terminally ADHD-set.S for Subtext! The Wachowskis really hate George W. Bush! We get it!F is for Fashionable, baby, Yeah! Terrorism is, like, you know, the new Black! It has a real thinning effect! And nothing brings a people together more than blowing up an historic national landmark with a tube-train filled to the brim with fertilizer bombs---does that mean Tim McVeigh is a posthumous performance artist?H for Hot! With that in mind, when she's not emoting her pretty little skull off or crying or writhing around on the ground in her cute little prison smock, clasping her little shaved-like-a-peach head---well God, blokes, is Natalie Portman not one peachy bird, baby? Yeah! I know the next time I dial up Madama Helga's I'll have to remember ""V"" and ask for the ""Portman Schoolgirl Special"". Rowrrrr, baby, behave!T for Teeth: as in, Jesus F*cking Christ the English have bad Teeth! When V's Halloween-party army takes over and the morning-after shivers wear off, the first act of legislation the new Government of the People should pass is one of free orthodontics: if whatever they were doing over at Larkhill caused these plaguey-bad choppers, then V was onto something, after all!Oh yes, and T for Thespians, too! Whatever ""V""'s faults, the acting is nearly sublime: all hands man their battle stations, and go down with this reeking turd---but throw out some fine performances along the way. Portman turns in the performance of her career as Evey; Stephen Rea (Finch) sulks his way through another flick; Stephen Fry (the snaggle-toothed Gordon) rejoices that he's at least not in ""Gosford Park""; John Hurt (Sutler) twirls his mustachios; and Hugo Weaving phones it in from beneath a heart---or face, anyway---of Oak.D for Deep Pockets! As in, where the h*ll did the freewheeling, itinerant V get enough money to afford Guy Fawkes costumes for the entire population of the British Isles? And come to think of it, wouldn't that sort of order have attracted notice? ""Made to order: 20 million Guy Fawkes outfits. COD.""B for Burkha! Which is what all the popcorn chomping cuties who left the theater wondering why the action quotient wasn't higher had better start fitting themselves for, if the general consensus is that terrorism is cool, blowing buildings up is groovy, and that the Koran is our flipbook for freedom.In the end, it's all M for Mediocrity, and more's the pity. Our shadowy latter-day Guy Fawkes does what he has to do, and serves as an exemplar of stealthy, shadowy urban terror: setting off fertilizer bombs in the bowels of London, whacking the errant, gouty, ulcerated perverted Archbishop (aren't they all, nowadays?), strapping himself up with TNT and parading into a broadcast booth, slitting throats with gay abandon.But the Wachowskis have deprived their Shakespearean anarachist of a suitable foe. In Moore's original, the dictator Adam Susan (renamed Sutler in the cinematic outing, so as to further underscore the Hitler/Bush parallel to the brain-challenged in the audience) was a worthy adversary, if only because he was just as deranged as V, and as equally devoted to his outsized notions of Order as V was to his unrequited love for abstracts like Justice and Liberty: arguably, they were mirror images.It's amusing that ""V"" gets raves for thumbing its wooden nose at Bush's America, where even illegal aliens feel free to march for their 'rights'---when this very instant in the Sudan---surely V's anarchic state of nature, a realm where the people are assuredly *not* afraid of their government because it no longer exists---men are slaughtered for the mistake of belonging to the wrong tribe.""V"" might have landed a roundhouse if it had pitted its Angel of Righteous Destruction against a truly committed avatar of Order---not the ranting Hitler-lite Sutler. Sadly, ""V""'s latter-day Guy Fawkes---reduced each year to a straw-man, and burned in effigy---is pitted against an even more hopeless Straw Man, and the film dies for it.""V for Vendetta"" is

176265,A2I2DE1DJUVQOO,1419838830,DarthRad,"[48, 79]","Oh jeez, how to begin to describe this pile of rubbish?Natalie Portman, as usual, manages to shine through the ridiculous premise of this movie, the illogical plotlines, and the hideously pious preaching of the current politically correct thinking of Hollywood.Hugo Weaving?  Does anybody even have proof that he was in this movie?  How do we know that it wasn't just David Prowse, or some other Darth Vader wannabe stiff taken off the actors' unemployment lines that was behind that Guy Fawkes mask?Hugo Weaving ACTING?  Give me a break.  His most outstanding acting abilities in previous movies have all been in his facial features, stern, menacing, and yet capable of compassion.Weaving's face is NEVER seen in this movie.  If that was him, what a waste of money and talent.  Waving your arms around, pointing your fingers here and there, and flinging knives, all the while wearing a mask, do not count as acting in my book - just about any high school level actor could have done this job.And as for all of this business about Britain being taken over by an evil conservative government with some sort of a pseudo-right wing Christian religious bent (which uses a double-cross symbol that somewhat resembles an Eastern Orthodox cross), come on, this is all Hollywood again.  Britain and Europe are now suffering from a severe DECLINE in religious beliefs everywhere except in the immigrant Muslim communities.  If there is a religion that is threatening the future well-being of Europeans, it is certainly not Christianity.  The Wachowski brothers are just doing the usual bigoted Christian bashing that has become so de rigueuer for Hollywood movies.Alan Moore, one of the creators of the original comic series on which this movie was based, had this to say about the movie:""[The movie] has been ""turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.""I have to say, in reading about the original comic book version of V for Vendetta, that Moore's own vision was also terribly near-sighted.  The comic book was riding the 1980's era liberal British themes of anti-Thatcherism and anti-Reaganism, as well as fear of a nuclear war that would destroy Britain as the result of Reagan basing American nuclear missiles in Europe.None of those fears came to pass.  Britain was revitalized by Thatcher's socialism-busting policies and became an economically freer and far more vigorous nation.  The threat posed by the American nuclear missiles in Europe led to a landmark nuclear disarmament agreement with the Soviet Union.

176266,A2Z0A3DOG0EVTY,1419838830,"David A. Dein ""passafist""","[18, 51]","Bollocks!  Bollocks I say! V FOR VENDETTA is pure drivel. I get that out of the way at the top of this review because I know it will not be the popular opinion.  But at some point I've realized that I'm nobody if I'm not honest. So I'll say it right now, V FOR VENDETTA is not an action movie, it's a propaganda film.  It's a film about how great anarchy is.About 50 or 70 years into the future Great Britain is run by a totalitarian dictator (John Hurt).  Books, music, and all sorts of free expression are banned.  The government has created a police state that keeps people in line.  Then a shadowy masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) steps out of the shadows and fights the government by exposing their corruption through terrorist actions.  Buildings are blown up, television signals are stolen, and caught in the middle of it all is Evey (Natalie Portman).  Evey, the reluctant student of the mysterious V, will play a pivotal role in overthrow of the government, whether she wants to or not.Now where do I start. On a purely cinematic level this movie is not very fluid. Most scenes revolve around characters talking about how horrible things are.  They talk and talk and then talk some more.  The screenplay is so verbose that any action you may have been expecting flashes by in seconds.  V's origin is told and retold at least 4 different times and there is a subplot involving an actress that just goes on and on.As for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government.  It's bold and the man involved in the full on attack of the social order doesn't parade around in mask.  He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see.  Yes he pays the consequences for his action, but he used the tools at hand to subvert the government.  He didn't need bombs, he didn't need violence, he just needed to be socially disobedient.But V this movies hero hides behind a mask of platitudes and terrorist actions.  He's too proud to put his face out there for the world to see.  He's like a man who writes a manifesto about how horrible the world is and signs it with an alias.  Who wants to listen to a coward. V believes that the only way to get people to listen is to blow things up and to murder the men in charge.  But what then?  Do you start another government?  Does that one become corrupt?I know its not a popular idea but did you ever just think that maybe human beings are rotten to the core? That our hearts are dark?  That if given the right circumstances we all could be Hitler? I know I've lied, I've stolen things, and I've hurt the people I love the most.  I've even made my wife cry and  I know there are people out there that think I'm a jerk. So I ask you am I good person? I strive to be, but the human condition drags me down.That's why we invent law.  Whether it be moral law, or traffic law, laws are put in place to fight against the human condition.  But Laws are so easily corrupted, from going 35 in a 25 miles per hour zone, or murdering your neighbor for his sneakers, we break laws because we are weak, selfish and at our cores we don't want anybody to tell us what to do.V operates in a place where humans are basically good except for those that disagree with him.  Government and greed are the problems.  He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right.  Organized religion is wrong. Politics is wrong. If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place.  But alas isn't he himself turning his followers into robots? What if one of his followers challenged him?  Would he be labeled a traitor?  Would he be sent away?  The final outcome of V FOR VENDETTA may seem helpful, but why replace one tyranny for another.I know I've gone off on a tangent here. I know my comments may make some people angry. But alas I live in America and for all the horrible things that are going wrong,  I'm glad I can still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right.  I can question my government without having to resort to terrorist actions and where men and women can believe what they want.  We are ""One Nation Under God"", be it a Christian God, or a Muslim God, or Zeus the God Of War.  My faith in America is not in the government.  My freedom is not protected by George W. Bush or V the mysterious masked vigilante.  It come from some place higher, some place stronger than myself.  Terrorism breeds more terrorism. Anarchy breeds nothing but chaos and V FOR VENDETTA is a horrible education in hedonism and nihilism.Do you want change the world?  It begins in the human heart. It begins when you strive to do good regardless of whether the Government is protecting you or not.  It's means dying not for self, but for others and striving for truth and not empty platitudes.

176267,AUEHG0DB54B7K,1419838830,David A. Wend,"[5, 8]","V for Vendetta is based upon a graphic novel by Alan Moore, which I was unaware of prior to seeing the film.  I cannot speak for the adaptation from the book but I found the film inspirational in that one understands the experiences from which the courage to face up to a totalitarian regime come from.The story begins some years in the not too distant future when England has been transformed into a Fascist state under the rule of a chancellor (played by John Hurt).  The United States is embroiled in a civil war (origin unknown).  The dictatorship (with overtones of Hitler) has a foot in Orwell's 1984 in describing a regime that has literally banned all freedoms but it struck me more that these are the hallmarks of all dictatorships: the cult of the leader, suppressing free speech, spying on their citizens.  The film centers on the mysterious character called ""V,"" who is part Zorro and Phantom of the Opera (in that he is disfigured) wearing a mask of Guy Fawkes (famed for the Gunpowder Plot during the reign of James I); he is an avenger and a liberator.  The pivotal character Evey (Rachael Portman) has suffered under the dictatorship with her parents (who protested against the regime) dying in labor camps and her brother dying as a result of biological weapon released by the government to instill fear.  The key part of the story is Evey's transformation from a fearful person, who bows to the dictatorship, into a defiant freedom fighter.However, Evey is not the only person affected by ""V.""  After his initial act of defiance (blowing up the Old Bailey on Guy Fawkes' Day) all of the people are awakened into their own acts of defiance.  This is the focus of ""V for Vendetta,"" that power is with the people to produce change.  This is true throughout history from the American Revolution to the Orange Revolution.  After seeing the film I read the reviews of some film critics who believe the film is a jab at the Bush Administration.  Lately, several films have been exploited for a political message that I think is simply not there.  Even the ""March of the Penguins"" became a political football when it was held up as an example of ""family values!""  One can read into ""V for Vendetta"" what one wishes but I do not see how it can be labeled as having an anti-Bush agenda.  The point of the film is that we all have a responsibility to hold our governments accountable for what they do, not just a single figure who has the courage to stand up; we all have to be ready to make sacrifices.  For me, this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.The casting is perfect on all levels.  Hugo Weaving rises to the challenge of acting behind a mask using his voice alone to bring depth to his character and Natalie Portman goes from a frightened young woman to being committed and fearless.  Stephen Rhea's Inspector Finch is an interesting everyman whose aim is to capture ""V"" but gradually understands the depths of the corrupt regime he is supporting, Stephen Fry has an excellent part as a television comedy show host who has much to hide and Tim Piggott-Smith is a superb villain.  Being a long-time fan of John Hurt it was enjoyable to see him again, especially since in the film of ""1984"" he was the victim of Big Brother.I was drawn into the film from the start and the 132 minutes passed faster than I wanted, and I highly recommend it.",5,A Thought Provoking Film,1143417600,"03 27, 2006",2006,3366,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'was', 'unaware', 'prior', 'seeing', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'speak', 'adaptation', 'book', 'found', 'film', 'inspirational', 'one', 'experiences', 'courage', 'face', 'up', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'come', 'from.The', 'story', 'years', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'when', 'England', 'been', 'transformed', 'Fascist', 'state', 'rule', 'chancellor', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'United', 'States', 'embroiled', 'civil', 'war', 'unknown', 'dictatorship', 'overtones', 'Hitler', 'foot', 'Orwell', '1984', 'describing', 'regime', 'literally', 'banned', 'freedoms', 'struck', 'more', 'are', 'hallmarks', 'dictatorships', 'cult', 'leader', 'suppressing', 'free', 'speech', 'spying', 'citizens', 'film', 'centers', 'mysterious', 'character', 'called', 'V', 'who', 'part', 'Zorro', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'disfigured', 'wearing', 'mask', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'famed', 'Gunpowder', 'Plot', 'reign', 'James', 'avenger', 'liberator', 'pivotal', 'character', 'Evey', 'Rachael', 'Portman', 'suffered', 'dictatorship', 'parents', 'who', 'protested', 'regime', 'dying', 'labor', 'camps', 'brother', 'dying', 'result', 'biological', 'weapon', 'released', 'government', 'instill', 'fear', 'key', 'part', 'story', 'Evey', 'transformation', 'fearful', 'person', 'who', 'dictatorship', 'defiant', 'freedom', 'fighter.However', 'Evey', 'not', 'only', 'person', 'affected', 'V.', 'initial', 'act', 'defiance', 'blowing', 'up', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'Day', 'people', 'are', 'awakened', 'own', 'acts', 'defiance', 'focus', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'power', 'people', 'produce', 'change', 'true', 'history', 'American', 'Revolution', 'Orange', 'Revolution', 'seeing', 'film', 'read', 'reviews', 'film', 'critics', 'who', 'believe', 'film', 'jab', 'Bush', 'Administration', 'Lately', 'several', 'films', 'have', 'been', 'exploited', 'political', 'message', 'think', 'simply', 'not', 'there', 'Even', 'March', 'Penguins', 'became', 'political', 'football', 'when', 'was', 'held', 'up', 'example', 'family', 'values', 'One', 'can', 'read', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'what', 'one', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'can', 'be', 'labeled', 'having', 'anti-Bush', 'agenda', 'point', 'film', 'have', 'responsibility', 'hold', 'governments', 'accountable', 'what', 'do', 'not', 'just', 'single', 'figure', 'who', 'courage', 'stand', 'up', 'have', 'be', 'ready', 'make', 'sacrifices', 'story', 'triumph', 'human', 'spirit.The', 'casting', 'perfect', 'levels', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'rises', 'challenge', 'acting', 'mask', 'using', 'voice', 'alone', 'bring', 'depth', 'character', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'frightened', 'young', 'woman', 'being', 'committed', 'fearless', 'Stephen', 'Rhea', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'interesting', 'everyman', 'aim', 'capture', 'V', 'gradually', 'depths', 'corrupt', 'regime', 'supporting', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'excellent', 'part', 'television', 'comedy', 'show', 'host', 'who', 'much', 'hide', 'Tim', 'Piggott-Smith', 'superb', 'villain', 'Being', 'long-time', 'fan', 'John', 'Hurt', 'was', 'enjoyable', 'see', 'again', 'especially', 'film', '1984', 'was', 'victim', 'Big', 'Brother.I', 'was', 'drawn', 'film', 'start', '132', 'minutes', 'passed', 'faster', 'wanted', 'highly', 'recommend']",N/A

Well its  funny because this movie was clearly supposed to have political undertones based around something that wasn't there in the comic.  I did read the comic, and in fact, reread it before I saw the movie.  Sure they changed a few things, but thats no big surprise.  The acting was fantastic, the script was still quite good, the cinematography was great, and overall it was a good movie.  The letter from Valerie was still just as moving, and actually moved me closer to tears than the comic ever could.  Portman was incredible in that moment too.  She made me believe she found that inch.  They changed the relationship between V and Evey a little bit, but it wasn't anything that was too surprising.  Hollywood likes to create a love story if they can.  There was a SMALL love story in the comic between them, but it was a differant kind than in the movie.  The love story did not get in the way at all though in either case.  The song playing when Evey leaves V though, that song and part just about broke my heart (I Found a Reason by Cat Power).  But Weaving stole the show.  That may have hardly been him under the mask even for all anyone knows, but his voice and his speeches were almost every bit as moving as anything V says in the comic.  Just remember, if the Valerie part doesn't move you at all, especially the part about the roses, even a small amount than you have no heart.

They hate this movie because it shows where this goverment is leading us. ""V"" is a true hero because the goverment he fights is unambiguously evil. We are not there, yet. This movie is merely a warning. It asks us to ""look ourselves in the mirror"" and not let our fears override our values. The dangers we face from terrorists are real, but also the fear mongering and deception of this goverment are real. That's the only way to explain how something as un-american and un-patriotic as the ""Patriot Act"" (""Articles of Allegiance"" in the movie) can get that name and be accepted by the citizens of our country. We as a nation are sure to face new attacks from terrorists, but we should never renounce our liberty for the sake of security.  As Benjamin Franklin said: ""He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither"". Maybe the intentions of the neocons are good, but ""I'm not here for what you hoped for, I'm here for what you did"".++Spoiler Warning++The movie itself is brilliant, the dialogue stupendous. In real life walking around quoting Shakespeare may be pedantic, but in a movie with a subtext about the power of words it's more than appropiate and actually enjoyable. ""V"" is a flawed hero, driven more by the desire for vengance than by ideals, but idealistic never the less. He realizes his shortcomings; he has became a monster and tells Evey as much in the climactic scene: ""You are right about what I've become, there is no tree at the end for me"". In other words, there can be no happy ending for ""V"", no tree to climb with his love like Edmund Dantes. The genius of that scene is that it makes the movie morally consistent.  In the end with the announced destruction of Parliment ""V"" just gives the people the opportunity to lose their fear of the goverment and reclaim their freedom. It still takes the will and civil courage of the people to actually walk the streets to take it back.

This movie is a rehash of various other cultural representations: most notably Big Brother and Hitler's Germany circa 1940. I can get behind stories about overthrowing oppression and injustice but this movie had nothing new to deliver. Yes V is the shady hero who was `created' by the government state and eventually brings their power to an end. This theme has been done by better novels and films so many times I can't even begin to list them all. Needless to say, this film offers nothing exciting or new to the genre.If I had known the screenplay was written by the Matrix brothers I never would have seen this film. These clowns are still running from the crime scene of the Matrix sequels and some producer figured they could get another yacht or two if they adapted another comic book to the big screen. Big mistake. I actually fell asleep watching this movie, and that hasn't happened since I saw some diseased Jennifer Lopez movie.A huge disappointment in the film is the Natalie Portman character. Portman has the accent down but that's the only good thing about this gig. Her character is lame. She is a nonentity in a film that focuses her as the main character (I think). Basically this girl has been oppressed and wronged by the government but when she `awakens' or whatever, she turns into a window shopper for a year. She literally just walks the streets.Anyway, I can imagine the Matrix brothers typing away at their computers with lofty goals of blending the `1984' genres into something new and cool.

V wants to overthrow the wicked government by blowing up buildings such as Parlament which will cause the people to rise up and take back the power.

Most of the movie is centered around Evey who gets rescued by V in the beggining and she slowly but surely starts to help V in his quest to overthrow the government. There is also a cop who's trying to find V and is trying to find out if his government is corrupt.Through the movie there are some references to America's war on terror and the kind of horrible consiquences it brought onto the world which I thought was a nice touch because it could be like that in the future but we won't know for a while.

Among the assorted bad guys he exterminates are Roger Allam as a military leader and media personality (bearing a strong resemblance to the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage), Sinead Cusack as a crooked scientist and John Hurt as a truly awe-inspiring Big Brother figure.  V is aided in his quest by Evie Rutherford (Natalie Portman), who discovers a lot about herself and her commitment in the process.

Warning- some people may find the movie offensive to their religious and/or political beliefs.However, the movie is the telling of how ""absolute power corrupts absolutely."" With an incredibly strong performance by Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea, the movie tells of a fascist society that is shaken when a character known only as V blows up the Old Bailey Courthouse while the 1812 Overture plays loudly on the loudspeakers placed throughout the streets of London. Evey (Natalie Portman) is a naf that V (Hugo Weaving) rescues from the guards when they are about to arrest her for violating curfew. Stephen Rea is the police inspector charged with tracking V, and as he trudges through his investigation, his faith in the government and his superiors is destroyed.V and Evey are drawn to each other while Evie is at the same time repelled by him. After he commits a murderous raid on the TV station where Evey works, she saves him from being arrested. He takes her to his hidden bunker and refuses to let her leave. He continues his murderous spree and Evey, in the course of helping him with one of the murders, escapes from him. However, she is soon taken prisoner by the police and tortured while undergoing interrogation about V's whereabouts.The end of the movie is truly stirring and brings to mind the revolutionary march scene from Les Miserables. The earlier scenes between Evey and V are very reminiscent of The Phantom of the Opera, although Evey never does see underneath V's mask. She doesn't need to because by the end of the movie she, and we, learn exactly who V is in a scene that is surely one of the great scenes of movie history.This is not a movie for young children due to scenes of graphic, realistic violence. However, people who are resistant to viewing the movie because it is produced by the same people who produced the Matrix or because they don't like Science Fiction movies or Super Hero movies can put those reservations aside. The movie is in no way a Science Fiction movie or even an action thriller, although there are action scenes in it.

Imagine being abducted and tortured by someone who later revealed that it was for your own good and it was only a ruse to convince you of their rightness. Literature that deals with this behavior is usually concerned with sociopaths and killers. Psychologists tell us that some victims of abduction and abuse can indeed demonstrate a loyalty to their abuser. I doubt that extolling a torturer was the intention of the film-makers, so for me their otherwise good intentions were seriously marred by the inclusion of these scenes.The cardboard cutout stereotype of the perverted religious figure was hackneyed and sophomoric long ago. Although, in the spirit of V, I am thankful that we still live in a tolerant society where such stereotyping is permitted.On a lesser point, I felt that Portman's performance was bland and unconvincing, and I think it wasn't necessary in such an international near-future to have her try to approximate an English accent.

Unfortunately, that isn't too distant from the world both the British and we Americans live in.  And that was my major concern. It is clear the creators wanted to comment on our current state, included the color coded states of curfew - much like homeland security's level of alert.  But they don't go all the way, they continually draw back on the punchHugo Weaving plays the masked V, terrorist/freedom fighter.  The only one willing or able to take on the totalitarian state.  He does so wearing a Guy Fawlkes mask, and uses the Fifth of November to remind people of two very simple principles:1. those who forfeit freedom for security deserve neither and 2. people should not fear their government, government should fear their people.Natalie Portman (rediscovering her ability act post Star Wars) is Evey - a woman swept up into V's life.This movie is rich in historical and literary allusion the way the matrix was rich in philosophical allusion.  From the Phantom of the Opera to the Resistance of the White Rose, from Blake to Shakespeare - well that isn't far!  For that alone, it is a joy. the scarlet pimpernel, Count of Monte Cristo - the list goes onThe action scenes are beautiful and rich. Beautifully shot and moving at times.Hugo Weaving gives an amazing performance. He somehow delivers an amazing range of emotions from behind a mask.Pros:1. Hugo Weaving.

176304,A84Z6XUMGRMJ1,1419838830,Duane Thomas,"[54, 90]","I have loved V for Vendetta for over 20 years. I first read the story - at least the first 2/3 of it - in 1985 when I bought all 26 issues of Warrior, a black-and-white British anthology magazine. V for Vendetta was originally serialized in Warrior from 1982-'85. V for Vendetta is divided internally into three ""Books"" or acts. Warrior was cancelled right at the end of the second Book. Three years later, DC Comics reunited the series creators, writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd, to finish the story which was published in 10 issues of a monthly comic in 1988-'89, then collected in 1990.V for Vendetta the comic is perhaps the best-written, most emotionally affecting, heart-breaking and involving piece of fiction I've ever read. As many of you already know, Alan Moore tried to block this movie from being made, and had his name removed from its credits. Part of this was because, I'm sure, after reading the script he realized what a turkey it was going to be. Also I suspect Moore was still immensely P.O.ed that the Wachowski brothers' final battle between Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix movies was such a blatant rip of the fight between Marvelman and Johnny Bates from Moore's Marvelman. I mean, my God, they didn't even bother to file off the serial numbers. Moore actually ended his relationship with DC Comics when they refused to retract statements (i.e. lies) saying he supported the movie.Within the first few minutes of watching this film, I knew something had gone horribly wrong. Let me make this clear: I'm a comic book fan. Unlike some fans, I don't think you can automatically fault a comics based movie for making changes from the source material. I realize that transferring an idea between media will necessitate changes. Sometimes those changes will even be improvements. (A good example would be the first Spider-Man film. Yes, they made changes to the origin. But in every instance the changes smoothed away logical inconsistencies in the 1962 story.) I **do** think you can fault changes from the source material when what was already there is infinitely better than what it was changed to. Every time there's a change in V for Vendetta the movie, it's for the worse. For instance:Comic: The Voice of Fate is an eerie, disembodied radio personality.Movie: The Voice of Fate is a fat, raving televangelist.Comic: Evey Hammond starts out a weak victim. When accosted by the fingermen, all she can do is whimper and beg for mercy. Evey is a metaphor for the person so beaten down by life, and existence within a totalitarian state, she has no guts, almost no individuality to speak of. At heart V for Vendetta is the story of how V, none too gently, forces Evey to face up to the evil in the world, to care, to find herself, and the strength to fight back. Evey is an experiment for V. Because he believes that inside even a born victim exists a potential hero. You just have to brutalize them enough first. This only works if Evey is weak initially.Movie: Evey is feisty to start with. Which leads to the ludicrous image of Evey, when surrounded by fingermen, threatening them with a canister of pepper spray. What depth! What wit! What garbage. She's supposed to look terrified and helpless - not silly.Comic: While rescuing Evey from the fingermen, V quotes a long passage from Shakespeare's Macbeth which begins, ""The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him."" It's witty and literate. (Moore reports his use of this dialogue as one of those bizarre synchronicities that sometimes occurs during writing. A copy of The Collected Works opened at random to a page containing this passage which matched, line for line, the actions he'd already decided on for V in his first clash with the forces of law and order.)Movie: V's speech is alliterative gobbledygook in which he shoehorns in as many words beginning with ""v"" as possible. ""Vichyssoise of villainy,"" indeed.Comic: V taunts and bedevils the fingermen, and sweeps Evey away, in the process killing one of the fingermen with a bomb, leaving appalled survivors staring at the gutted, charred remains of what, but a few seconds before, had been a human being. Admittedly the way he does this (the fingerman grabs V's hand to arrest him, and the fake hand detaches before exploding) is hokey but the nucleus idea of a great scene is there. I would have liked, in the movie, this conflict to be much more brutal - just a bit of tweaking and it could have been great - but that's not what we get, either.Movie: V's fight with the fingermen is a Keystone Kops routine, complete with him pulling one man's pants down around his ankles. It's so bad it's painful to watch.Comic: Evey's first reaction to V is awe. The expression artist David Lloyd puts on her face is rapt, almost mesmerized. One of the creepier things about V for Vendetta is just how easily and instantly V pulls Evey into his world. This goes back to the idea that, to start with, it's almost as though Evey really has no will of her own. It's like she's been waiting to exist, for something, ANYTHING interesting to happen in her life, to wake her up. V might be homicidal and possibly insane - but he's definitely interesting.Movie: Natalie Portman, showing all the emotional range and acting skill of a wooden mannikin, stares at V with an arch ""Who is this freak?"" look on her face. (Or maybe she's just appalled at the dialogue?) Where is the talented actress who showed such immense early promise in The Professional? I ask, because I haven't seen her since. More importantly, where is the awe on Evey's face showing how completely V fascinates her? Natalie's expression in this scene commits the cardinal sin in a comic-to-movie translation: it condescends to the material (like the dropping trousers of a few seconds before), gives the impression ""Yes, we know this is all really rather silly"" during a moment that should be played perfectly straight.You see what I mean? Every change trades emotional depth for shallowness, brutality for slapstick, the weird exchanged for the ludicrous. These are only examples from the movie's first few minutes. I truly got the sense, watching this film, its makers had no real insight beyond a surface level of what was actually happening in the comic, were absolutely clueless regarding the internal dynamics, the deeper issues, that made it great.

176307,AWBS5D7SI70S,1419838830,"E. Day ""ENIGMA""","[1, 3]","Let me first start by saying that i REALLY WANTED TO HATE THIS MOVIE, when i first heard the title, i thought it somewhat weak, then i saw the protagonist hero wore a clown-like mask while fighting evil, which sorry to say really didn't help win me over, and when i heard that the Wachowski Brother's helped put the movie together, my opinion was complete(I'm still boiling over their final installment of the Matrix Trilogy which i enjoyed about as much as inflamed genital boils).However, despite my prejudgment,i must confess this movie is a triumph. Its almost like taking Batman and putting him in a Shakespearean modern conceptualization of George Orwell's 1984.Simply put, the story is a romanticized view of a lone hero set out toward opening the minds of his fellow English brothers and sisters oppressed by a fascist government gone crazy. Although she gets top billing, Natlie Portman provides nothing more than a pretty face and limited acting skills as the sometimes unwilling disciple of V, the blade wielding, eclectic,(possibly sociopathic) protagonist (played by Hugo Weaving, AKA..Mr. Smith from the Matrix trilogy) who more than adequately makes up for Ms. Portmans terribly limited acting skills (sweety you had your five minutes of fame in Star Wars, take it, and may the FORCE BE WITH YOU).The most interesting aspect of the movie, was in how realistic the future painted is, to the life and society we live in today.If you play close attention you will see how the insane fascist dictator seems vaguely familiar to a certain American leader who like in the movie is against homosexuality, has ostracized his nation from the rest of the world, and uses continuous fear to keep his country in line (i.e. 9/11, Bird flu, Axis of evil, and the continuous war on terror)....... but i digress.. no point in beating around the er..um.. BUSH.Another point that should be mentioned is the groundbreaking aspect this movie sets in regards to many action flicks in that it doesn't hold its own on fancy special effect, but on simply an intelligent smart story(sadly a rarity in many action films these days).

176310,A13E0ARAXI6KJW,1419838830,Ed Uyeshima,"[3, 6]","Cinematic translations of graphic novels and comic books seem to be gaining prominence these days with ""Sin City"", ""A History of Violence"" and ""Aeon Flux"" as three examples of this growing genre. Here is another one adapted from a series of comic books written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd between 1982 and 1985. Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature ""Matrix"" style and directed by their protege James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty-year old origins has a timely relevance in a post-9/11 world. It is indeed a comic book come to life, but it's also an often powerful political allegory that takes subtle jabs at the current administrations in both the UK and the US.It's all set in a dystopian London in the year 2020, a time when England has turned into a totalitarian regime under the thumb of fascist chancellor Adam Sutler. The story focuses on a young TV station assistant named Evey. On her way to meet her co-worker, TV personality Gordon Dietrich, she is caught after curfew by some thugs in a dark alley. A savior arrives in the form of a masked vigilante named V, and their ensuing relationship is what drives the labyrinth plot. Starting with the nighttime destruction of the Old Bailey, complete with fireworks and Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" blaring over loudspeakers, V orchestrates terrorist acts in a one-man attempt to usurp Sutler. Evey is frightened but ultimately intrigued by V, as her parents were taken away by Sutler's storm troopers as political agitators. She eventually seeks sanctuary with Dietrich but then gets caught in what appears to be her own purgatory. At the same time, the tenacious Inspector Finch attempts to find V before any further terrorist acts occur.This apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure. Many of the visual elements are impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative. The Wachowskis have constructed a complex, elliptical story with so many convolutions around the various targets - the government, the media, the terrorists - that it gets difficult to keep track. Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the ""Beauty and the Beast""-cum-""Phantom of the Opera"" connection between V and Evey.On the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian. There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler. With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb. As V, Hugo Weaving does what he can behind the confines of the Joker-style mask. In an ironic twist to his role as Winston in ""1984"", John Hurt chews quite a bit of scenery in the decidedly Big Brother role of Sutler. Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich. The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative filmmaking.",4,A for Audacious...B for Execution,1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3542,"['Cinematic', 'translations', 'graphic', 'novels', 'comic', 'books', 'seem', 'be', 'gaining', 'days', 'Sin', 'City', 'History', 'Violence', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'three', 'examples', 'growing', 'genre', 'Here', 'one', 'adapted', 'series', 'comic', 'books', 'written', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'illustrated', 'David', 'Lloyd', '1982', '1985', 'Produced', 'written', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'signature', 'Matrix', 'style', 'directed', 'protege', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'movie', 'wildly', 'inventive', 'premise', 'twenty-year', 'old', 'origins', 'timely', 'relevance', 'post-9/11', 'world', 'indeed', 'comic', 'book', 'come', 'life', 'also', 'often', 'powerful', 'political', 'allegory', 'subtle', 'jabs', 'current', 'administrations', 'UK', 'US.It', 'set', 'dystopian', 'London', 'year', '2020', 'time', 'when', 'England', 'turned', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'thumb', 'fascist', 'chancellor', 'Adam', 'Sutler', 'story', 'young', 'TV', 'station', 'assistant', 'named', 'Evey', 'way', 'meet', 'co-worker', 'TV', 'personality', 'Gordon', 'Dietrich', 'caught', 'curfew', 'thugs', 'dark', 'alley', 'savior', 'arrives', 'form', 'masked', 'vigilante', 'named', 'V', 'ensuing', 'relationship', 'what', 'labyrinth', 'plot', 'Starting', 'nighttime', 'destruction', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'complete', 'fireworks', 'Tchaikovsky', '1812', 'Overture', 'blaring', 'loudspeakers', 'V', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'one-man', 'attempt', 'usurp', 'Sutler', 'Evey', 'frightened', 'ultimately', 'intrigued', 'V', 'parents', 'were', 'taken', 'away', 'Sutler', 'storm', 'troopers', 'political', 'agitators', 'eventually', 'sanctuary', 'Dietrich', 'then', 'caught', 'what', 'be', 'own', 'purgatory', 'same', 'time', 'tenacious', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'attempts', 'find', 'V', 'further', 'terrorist', 'acts', 'occur.This', 'apocalyptic', 'movie', 'dares', 'ask', 'question', 'terrorism', 'ever', 'justified', 'filmmakers', 'go', 'making', 'V', 'scarifying', 'ultimately', 'sympathetic', 'figure', 'Many', 'visual', 'elements', 'are', 'impressive', 'here', 'various', 'plot', 'points', 'do', 'not', 'coalesce', 'coherent', 'narrative', 'Wachowskis', 'have', 'constructed', 'complex', 'elliptical', 'story', 'so', 'many', 'convolutions', 'various', 'targets', 'government', 'media', 'terrorists', 'difficult', 'keep', 'track', 'Part', 'problem', 'simply', 'scope', 'movie', 'agenda', 'feels', 'so', 'broad', 'make', 'elements', 'feel', 'trivial', 'particular', 'Beauty', 'Beast', '-cum-', 'Phantom', 'Opera', 'connection', 'V', 'Evey.On', 'other', 'hand', 'certain', 'passages', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'such', 'brutalizing', 'sequence', 'when', 'Evey', 'incarcerated', 'read', 'series', 'notes', 'prisoner', 'named', 'Valerie', 'who', 'been', 'executed', 'being', 'lesbian', 'are', 'also', 'welcome', 'bits', 'humor', 'example', 'Evey', 'dressed', 'one', 'scene', 'little', 'girl', 'gain', 'trust', 'bishop', 'critical', 'allowing', 'one', 'V', 'attacks', 'occur', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'antics', 'Dietrich', 'TV', 'show', 'meant', 'ridicule', 'V', 'Sutler', 'convincing', 'British', 'accent', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'solid', 'as', 'Evey', 'adventurous', 'vulnerable', 'sides', 'equal', 'aplomb', 'V', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'what', 'can', 'behind', 'confines', 'Joker-style', 'mask', 'ironic', 'twist', 'role', 'Winston', '1984', 'John', 'Hurt', 'quite', 'bit', 'scenery', 'decidedly', 'Big', 'Brother', 'role', 'Sutler', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'subtle', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'dry', 'comic', 'manner', 'good', 'effect', 'Dietrich', 'movie', 'bit', 'long', '132', 'minutes', 'relentlessly', 'creative', 'filmmaking']",N/A

I did not go in with any pre-conceived notions or political agenda.After the artistically disasterous Matrix trilogy (sorry, all three films were three too many), the Wachowski brothers return to the big screen with a vengenece with the explosive ""V for Vendetta"". The setting takes place in the future where the United States is no longer the lone superpower on the planet and is in a complete disarray. Britain has now taken over the US's role. Along the way John Hurt's character Adam Sutler has risen to power and became a totalitarian dictator. Hugo Weaving plays a mysterious figure named V who hides behind a mask. His intentions are to bring down Adam Sutler and his cronies. Natalie Portman is Evey, a young woman who accidently gets caught up in V's escapades when V rescues her from some strangers who tries to attack her.I enjoyed this film a bit. The action sequences and the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved listening to Hugo Weaving speak through the mask so eloquently. It was quite a departure from his villainous role in the Matrix series. I loved the diversity in the music which ranged from orchestral to modern day indie pop (Cat Power).

The opening scene flashes back to November 5, 1604 to introduce Guy Fawkes and his plot to blow up Parliament. This event lays the foundation for the rest of the film. The Wachowski brothers take us to futuristic Great Britian under a totalitarian government. They masterfully weave a tale of rebellion focusing on two protagonists- V (Hugo Weaving), and Evey (Natalie Portman). This film does a really good job of developing the characters and moving the plot forward at the same time. The dialogue is incredible - V has some of the wittiest and thought provoking lines/speeches I have heard in any movie. This film is great for people who enjoy movies that make you think. The themes it focuses on include - freedom fighter v. terrorist, rebellion, and fear and freedom.With that being said this movie is not for everyone. It is violent and there are some scenes in a prison/torture that make some people uncomfortable. My wife doesn't really enjoy watching it.

I am here to tell my opinion on the whole situation regarding V for Vendetta.Great message. Freedom is a must, and people do have to care to make a change. We have to shake ourselves out of complacency and indifference to make change. We must think for ourselves and regain our humanity.I also agree that the movie is taking a stab at our government, which is neither good nor bad. It is what it is.I am here to just review the art.The story of V for Vendetta is so over-played and over-done, it is just plain annoying. The drama inherent within the movie is cheesy and the whole FREEDOM thing is done out of proportion. Like another reviewer stated, this movie as about revenge, not freedom. There is no freedom in revenge, revenge is another emotion that holds you captive, just like indifference. Therefore, I felt that the message of the movie was largly inconsistant. And throwing in Shakespearian quotes does not make the movie any better.The dialogue is horrible, and the action sequences are yawn inducing. Bullet-time is used again(!) but this time knifes replace bullets.What's the message of the film? Freedom or violence to reach freedom? Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the fact that they used violence to gain freedom in the movie, I just think that many misguided people will take this movie as true and think violence will ""free"" them from their ""oppression"".The writer and directors seem to have executed certain parts to tug at the heart strings of the audience, which failed misrably in my opinion. The writer tries to make a sentimental moment out of every scene, and it just doesn't work.Largly un-original concepts and over-done plot make this a very weak movie that too many people think too highly of, Probably because everyone loves to bash Mr. Bush and America, even if they have no clue as to why they are doing it. But hey, everyone else is:)Don't get me wrong, I am just as anti-anti freedom as any other lover of freedom and humantiy, but just because a movie features action and some guy fighting for freedom, does not make it a great movie.Decent film, worth renting. Provides a nice release to rebel-wannabes who are too afraid to help make change and would rather dream about it, a large reason why things are the way they are:)",3,CLICHE' story line...great message,1155427200,"08 13, 2006",2006,2380,"[""'m"", 'not', 'going', 're-iterate', 'who', 'was', 'movie', 're-hash', 'story', 'can', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'am', 'here', 'tell', 'opinion', 'whole', 'situation', 'regarding', 'V', 'Vendetta.Great', 'message', 'Freedom', 'must', 'people', 'do', 'have', 'care', 'make', 'change', 'have', 'shake', 'complacency', 'indifference', 'make', 'change', 'must', 'think', 'ourselves', 'regain', 'humanity.I', 'also', 'agree', 'movie', 'taking', 'stab', 'government', 'neither', 'good', 'bad', 'what', 'am', 'here', 'just', 'review', 'art.The', 'story', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'so', 'over-played', 'over-done', 'just', 'plain', 'annoying', 'drama', 'inherent', 'movie', 'cheesy', 'whole', 'FREEDOM', 'thing', 'done', 'proportion', 'reviewer', 'stated', 'movie', 'revenge', 'not', 'freedom', 'freedom', 'revenge', 'revenge', 'emotion', 'captive', 'just', 'indifference', 'Therefore', 'felt', 'message', 'movie', 'was', 'largly', 'inconsistant', 'throwing', 'Shakespearian', 'quotes', 'not', 'make', 'movie', 'better.The', 'dialogue', 'horrible', 'action', 'sequences', 'are', 'yawn', 'inducing', 'Bullet-time', 'used', 'again', 'time', 'knifes', 'replace', 'message', 'film', 'Freedom', 'violence', 'reach', 'freedom', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', ""'m"", 'not', 'bashing', 'fact', 'used', 'violence', 'gain', 'freedom', 'movie', 'just', 'think', 'many', 'misguided', 'people', 'will', 'take', 'movie', 'true', 'think', 'violence', 'will', 'free', 'oppression', '.The', 'writer', 'directors', 'seem', 'have', 'executed', 'certain', 'parts', 'tug', 'heart', 'strings', 'audience', 'failed', 'misrably', 'opinion', 'writer', 'make', 'sentimental', 'moment', 'scene', 'just', ""n't"", 'work.Largly', 'un-original', 'concepts', 'over-done', 'plot', 'make', 'very', 'weak', 'movie', 'too', 'many', 'people', 'think', 'too', 'highly', 'Probably', 'everyone', 'bash', 'Mr.', 'Bush', 'America', 'even', 'have', 'clue', 'why', 'are', 'doing', 'hey', 'everyone', 'else', 'Do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'am', 'just', 'anti-anti', 'freedom', 'other', 'lover', 'freedom', 'humantiy', 'just', 'movie', 'action', 'guy', 'fighting', 'freedom', 'not', 'make', 'great', 'movie.Decent', 'film', 'worth', 'renting', 'Provides', 'nice', 'release', 'rebel-wannabes', 'who', 'are', 'too', 'afraid', 'help', 'make', 'change', 'would', 'rather', 'dream', 'large', 'reason', 'why', 'things', 'are', 'way', 'are']",N/A

V For Vendetta is simply an amazing movie. I was a bit worried when I heard that the Wachowski Brothers and a first-time director were involved, however within the first ten minutes of the movie my fears were washed away.  V For Vendetta is spectacular in every possible way. From the first scene to the last, the movie is completely gripping and you will not want to look away until the end credits roll. The movie is well-written, well directed and well acted. Everything about it is top-notch. Everything. I can't think of any flaws. I'm sure that there must be one somewhere, but I can't think of any. It's unbelievable that director James McTeigue is a first-timer. The movie is so beautifully and effortlessly directed that you'd assume there must be some seasoned veteran behind the camera.Being that it was based on a graphic novel and produced by the Wachowskis, I wasn't very excited to see it figuring it would be another bloated action-fest with tons of CGI and no story and I'd be bored out of my mind. Boy, was I wrong. For one thing, V For Vendetta is not even an action movie. It has a few action scenes here and there (particularly one Matrix-style scene near the end), however for the most part it's a fantasy/sci-fi/drama. Not being a big action fan I was thrilled by the lack of action scenes. For once we have a comic book movie that is about characters, story and ideas rather than special effects and car chases and fight sequences. The actors are great too. The large, primarily British cast is uniformly excellent. Particularly worth mentioning is Hugo Weaving (best known as Agent Smith in The Matrix). Weaving gives an excellent performance in the movie despite having his face always hidden by a mask. How do you emote without your face being visible? That is the challenge and Hugo succeeds marvelously. Natalie Portman is also very good as V's helper/love interest and John Hurt is venomous as the evil British Chancellor.If only all of the big-budget movies to come out of Hollywood could be HALF as good as this, we'd be in excellent shape. This movie will forever erase the memories of the Matrix sequels from your mind. In fact, V For Vendetta is better than all three Matrix movies put together. Bye bye Neo.

Who wouldn't be?""- VI bring in this qoute from the movie becuase I have to say that this movie totally blows your mind on so many levels. The character known only as ""V"" looks like your simple, reptative man in a mask who is either a superhero or a serial killer. I'm sure that we've all seen that song and dance before. This, in turn, makes moviewatchers afriad to go see the movie thinking that it will be unoriginal and just more of the same nonsense formula that everyonE and their cousin has already seen. This is not true.This story, like a good book, evolves on the screen. It unfolds and strikes purpose into the hearts, minds, and spirits of many people who have watched it.When me and my girlfriend first thought of going to see a movie, we both agreed on V for Vendetta in hopes that it would be unique and that it would stand out among all movies made from 1920's--to---2005. And our minds were thankfully melted in a moment of sheer nostalgia grace. This movie has a life of its own! It breathes heart and sheds tears in your soul. The perfect movie of 2006 has finally arrived, knocking on the door in the famous V persona with a rose to greet us all with.After the first viewing, we had to see it again imedietally and . . .were blown away for a second time!This movie, you should know, is not your typical action-movie-superhero story. It has a deeper meaning and an even deeper plotline. The story is mult-layered with symbols, history, operatic, and sometimes funny, scenes all mixed together in a tapestry of hope.The begining, middle, and ending were perfect in every way. Period.I have no gripes or any thing bad to say about it becuase for me it is impossible to do so. It just is.Whether you like the movie or hate it; it did its job in making you think. Since that fateful day, and that 8.00 dollar ticket stubb, me and my girlfriend can not shuddap about how fluidly brillant this gem of a movie is!We've seen it three times in all and, in all probability will go see it a fourth and fifth.And we will both own the dvd and watch it until it breaks from lack of oxygen from never leaving our dvd players!To those who don't like the movie I will say that you are entitled to your opinion but I believe that when you invest your time watching a movie . . . your head should be clear, a clean slate, if you will. All political views, likes, dislikes, and moods should be tossed out the car window on your way to the theater.Take this into perspective: Everyone knows that there are numerous superheroes, correct? There's Batman, Super-man, Spider-man, X-men, many more. Now, when you go to watch any of those seprate movies do you really expect for any of those movies to have character cross-overs or a relation to each other? No. Why? Becuase each of those movies exist in their own little world.V for Vendetta, aside from being the best movie you will ever see in your entire life, has been beaten with remarks and comments that it's attacking political views. No it's not. When you see this movie you must keep an open mind!This is such a good movie, it deserves its own GENRE category!What I liked the most about this film is that it was never corny, but always sly; never stupid, always smart; never overhyped, always reaching expectations; never predictable, always unexpected; never Normal, always original; Characters have scope, they never are two-dimensional.Each frame is like a comic-book panel!This isn't a movie, folks! THIS IS MOVING ART!!!!And so, on an ending note, let it be known that I could compliment this movie in explosive detail.This movie made me remember the fifth of November and my girlfriend as well. And we will always remember the persona of that delictably mischieviously independent masked vigilante ""V"".Just know that this movie reaches the goal of being different and memorable.IT OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!!IT'S EVEN TEN TIMES BETTER THAN THE MATRIX!!!!!!",5,THIS MOVIE OVERSHADOWS ALL MOVIES!!!,1145232000,"04 17, 2006",2006,3953,"['know', 'what', 'happened', 'were', 'afraid', 'Who', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'VI', 'bring', 'qoute', 'movie', 'becuase', 'have', 'say', 'movie', 'totally', 'mind', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'character', 'known', 'only', 'V', 'simple', 'reptative', 'man', 'mask', 'who', 'superhero', 'serial', 'killer', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'song', 'dance', 'before', 'turn', 'moviewatchers', 'afriad', 'go', 'see', 'movie', 'thinking', 'will', 'be', 'unoriginal', 'just', 'more', 'same', 'nonsense', 'formula', 'everyonE', 'cousin', 'already', 'seen', 'not', 'true.This', 'story', 'good', 'book', 'screen', 'unfolds', 'strikes', 'purpose', 'hearts', 'minds', 'spirits', 'many', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'watched', 'girlfriend', 'first', 'thought', 'going', 'see', 'movie', 'agreed', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'hopes', 'would', 'be', 'unique', 'would', 'stand', 'out', 'movies', 'made', '1920', '-2005', 'minds', 'were', 'thankfully', 'melted', 'moment', 'sheer', 'nostalgia', 'grace', 'movie', 'life', 'own', 'heart', 'sheds', 'tears', 'soul', 'perfect', 'movie', '2006', 'finally', 'arrived', 'knocking', 'door', 'famous', 'V', 'persona', 'rose', 'greet', 'with.After', 'first', 'viewing', 'had', 'see', 'again', 'imedietally', '.were', 'blown', 'away', 'second', 'time', 'movie', 'should', 'know', 'not', 'typical', 'action-movie-superhero', 'story', 'deeper', 'meaning', 'even', 'deeper', 'plotline', 'story', 'mult-layered', 'symbols', 'history', 'operatic', 'sometimes', 'funny', 'scenes', 'mixed', 'together', 'tapestry', 'hope.The', 'begining', 'middle', 'ending', 'were', 'perfect', 'way', 'Period.I', 'have', 'gripes', 'thing', 'bad', 'say', 'becuase', 'impossible', 'do', 'so', 'just', 'is.Whether', 'movie', 'hate', 'did', 'job', 'making', 'think', 'fateful', 'day', '8.00', 'dollar', 'ticket', 'stubb', 'girlfriend', 'can', 'not', 'shuddap', 'how', 'fluidly', 'brillant', 'gem', 'movie', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'three', 'times', 'probability', 'will', 'go', 'see', 'fourth', 'fifth.And', 'will', 'own', 'dvd', 'watch', 'lack', 'oxygen', 'never', 'leaving', 'dvd', 'players', 'who', 'do', ""n't"", 'like', 'movie', 'will', 'say', 'are', 'entitled', 'opinion', 'believe', 'when', 'invest', 'time', 'watching', 'movie', 'head', 'should', 'be', 'clear', 'clean', 'slate', 'will', 'political', 'views', 'likes', 'dislikes', 'moods', 'should', 'be', 'tossed', 'out', 'car', 'window', 'way', 'theater.Take', 'perspective', 'Everyone', 'are', 'numerous', 'superheroes', 'correct', 'Batman', 'Super-man', 'Spider-man', 'X-men', 'many', 'more', 'Now', 'when', 'go', 'watch', 'seprate', 'movies', 'do', 'really', 'expect', 'movies', 'have', 'character', 'cross-overs', 'relation', 'other', 'Why', 'Becuase', 'movies', 'exist', 'own', 'little', 'world.V', 'Vendetta', 'aside', 'being', 'best', 'movie', 'will', 'ever', 'see', 'entire', 'life', 'been', 'beaten', 'remarks', 'comments', 'attacking', 'political', 'views', 'not', 'When', 'see', 'movie', 'must', 'keep', 'open', 'mind', 'such', 'good', 'movie', 'own', 'GENRE', 'category', 'What', 'liked', 'most', 'film', 'was', 'never', 'corny', 'always', 'sly', 'never', 'stupid', 'always', 'smart', 'never', 'overhyped', 'always', 'reaching', 'expectations', 'never', 'predictable', 'always', 'unexpected', 'never', 'Normal', 'always', 'original', 'Characters', 'have', 'scope', 'never', 'are', 'two-dimensional.Each', 'frame', 'comic-book', 'panel', ""n't"", 'movie', 'folks', 'THIS', 'MOVING', 'ART', 'so', 'ending', 'note', 'let', 'be', 'known', 'could', 'compliment', 'movie', 'explosive', 'detail.This', 'movie', 'made', 'remember', 'fifth', 'November', 'girlfriend', 'as', 'well', 'will', 'always', 'remember', 'persona', 'delictably', 'mischieviously', 'independent', 'masked', 'vigilante', 'V', '.Just', 'know', 'movie', 'goal', 'being', 'different', 'memorable.IT', 'OVERSHADOWS', 'ALL', 'MOVIES', 'IT', 'EVEN', 'TEN', 'TIMES', 'BETTER', 'THAN', 'THE', 'MATRIX']",N/A

Our focus England has become a fascist state headed by a religious maniac. Gays are hunted and killed - and the Koran is outlawed. One poor gay television producer/host had a secret stash of outlawed art and he also had a Koran. Bad news for him. He's beaten to death by the not-so-secret police. You mustn't have a Koran. The symbol of the new regime is the double-cross.The powerful men in the country all made their money from drug companies. Where else? The drug companies are the great villains of the left - as if they don't hunger for drugs to cure them of their various diseases as do right wingers.Now this is a very good movie about revolutionary zeal in the face of oppression and I recommend it but I have strong intellectual reservations. We don't need to create a Christian, double-crossed, wacko fanatic madman leader of England when the Muslim fascistic movement is in full steam right now across the globe and they are the ones who already have these types of oppressive religio-manic societies.

In a Margaret Thatcher England or in (pick one): Afghanistan, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Iran, Iraq or in the communist states of North Korea, Cuba or the dictatorship of China?

And the drug companies! Are they villains again? Are drug companies the enemy of the people? I take drugs created by drug companies that have saved my life.

176331,ANBQIWHO9JRFS,1419838830,General Zombie,"[16, 24]","I was in the middle of writing a long, long review for this, but it sucked, sucked, sucked, so I'll try for something short.  So here it is: 'V for Vendetta' is a sharp, good-looking and solidly crafted, I dunno, action-thriller-sci-fi kinda thing.  It's far from 100% faithful to the comic, but it's closer than I'd anticipated, and manages to par things down into a more cohesive narrative.  This comes at the cost of some ideas, yes, which is too bad, but it's a necessary evil and doesn't come with out some benefits.  Personally, I thought the comic was a bit too meandering and lacked sufficient narrative thrust.  That's bound to be a problem much of the time, considering the format, but it's was worse then it needed be.  Still, some good stuff is lost.  I particularly miss V's affinity for anarchy:  Here they really make no mention of this, with the only vestige remaining being his V symbol, which is, of course, a circled anarchy 'A' turned upside down, minus the line across.  He opposes the current government, yes, but there's no discussion of what he'd replace it with.This was written and produced by the Wachowskis, so yes it's got some Matrix-isms, but fewer then plenty of other films, and the dialogue is rarely, though still occasionally, painful.  The action scenes are generally nicely done; I particularly like the one towards the end, which features many slow motion gouts of blood.  So many action movies are tragically bloodless...  The film looks great, creating a plausible near-future Britain  that manages to be very cold and distant without seeming to far removed from reality.  Performances are solid all around, with particular kudos going to Weaving as V.  He's most notable for the fact that his character is simply believable and not utterly ridiculous.  It would've been very easy for him to come across as such.  Portman is acceptable as Evey, and while the performance is hardly stunning there's really nothing wrong with it. (Just further proof of what a godawful writer/director George Lucas is...)  The rest of the cast are character actor types, and they're all fine.  Interestingly enough, Stephen Rea's Finch, the man who is heading the investigation of V and discovers dangerous governmental secrets in the process, is the major point of identification for the audience. (Or, he was for me.)  I liked him, so it worked, I guess.  Also, I think it's neat that this movie is filled with ugly people, all creased and lumpy and old and with bad teeth.  (Though the one major female character is still very attractive, prior to her hair being cut off, anyway.)  That just happens so rarely.The film perhaps dragged slightly in the final acts, but only briefly.  It's also hurt by a slightly underwhelming and perhaps overly happy conclusion, but how do you finish a story like this anyway?  The ending in the comic wasn't utterly satisfactory either, so while it's different it's a fairly lateral move.The controversy surrouding this film is fairly stupid.  Yes, it's Anti-Bush.  I've encountered anti-Bush sentiments before, however, so I'm not particularly shocked or impressed.  Yeah, the protagonist is a 'terrorist', but that just proves how vague and variable language is.  He blows up a couple of empty buildings and kills some people who wronged him personally all while attacking a government that is legitmately evil and managing to avoid injuring the innocent almost entirely.  In short, he's no more subersive thean a million other film heroes, and less so then plenty.Yeah, I'm done.  An entertaining, sometimes enthralling film.  It's not as smart or deep as it thinks it is, or as some will tell you, but it's smarter than most major films, I suppose, and is always watchable, which is what really matters.Grade: B",4,"Solid, Entertaining adaptation",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,3774,"['was', 'middle', 'writing', 'long', 'long', 'review', 'sucked', 'sucked', 'sucked', ""'ll"", 'try', 'something', 'short', 'So', 'here', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'sharp', 'good-looking', 'solidly', 'crafted', 'dunno', 'action-thriller-sci-fi', 'kinda', 'thing', 'far', '100', '%', 'faithful', 'comic', 'closer', ""'d"", 'anticipated', 'par', 'things', 'down', 'more', 'cohesive', 'narrative', 'cost', 'ideas', 'yes', 'too', 'bad', 'necessary', 'evil', ""n't"", 'come', 'out', 'benefits', 'Personally', 'thought', 'comic', 'was', 'bit', 'too', 'meandering', 'lacked', 'sufficient', 'narrative', 'thrust', 'bound', 'be', 'problem', 'much', 'time', 'considering', 'format', 'was', 'worse', 'then', 'needed', 'be', 'Still', 'good', 'stuff', 'lost', 'particularly', 'miss', 'V', 'affinity', 'anarchy', 'Here', 'really', 'make', 'mention', 'only', 'vestige', 'remaining', 'being', 'V', 'symbol', 'course', 'circled', 'anarchy', 'A', 'turned', 'upside', 'down', 'line', 'current', 'government', 'yes', 'discussion', 'what', ""'d"", 'replace', 'was', 'written', 'produced', 'Wachowskis', 'so', 'got', 'Matrix-isms', 'fewer', 'then', 'plenty', 'other', 'films', 'dialogue', 'rarely', 'still', 'occasionally', 'painful', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'generally', 'nicely', 'done', 'particularly', 'one', 'end', 'many', 'slow', 'motion', 'gouts', 'blood', 'So', 'many', 'action', 'movies', 'are', 'tragically', 'bloodless', 'film', 'great', 'creating', 'plausible', 'near-future', 'Britain', 'be', 'very', 'cold', 'distant', 'seeming', 'far', 'removed', 'reality', 'Performances', 'are', 'solid', 'particular', 'kudos', 'going', 'Weaving', 'V.', 'most', 'notable', 'fact', 'character', 'simply', 'believable', 'not', 'utterly', 'ridiculous', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'very', 'easy', 'come', 'such', 'Portman', 'acceptable', 'Evey', 'performance', 'hardly', 'stunning', 'really', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'Just', 'further', 'proof', 'what', 'godawful', 'writer/director', 'George', 'Lucas', 'rest', 'cast', 'are', 'character', 'actor', 'types', ""'re"", 'fine', 'Interestingly', 'enough', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Finch', 'man', 'who', 'heading', 'investigation', 'V', 'discovers', 'dangerous', 'governmental', 'secrets', 'process', 'major', 'point', 'identification', 'audience', 'was', 'liked', 'worked', 'guess', 'Also', 'think', 'neat', 'movie', 'filled', 'ugly', 'people', 'creased', 'lumpy', 'old', 'bad', 'teeth', 'one', 'major', 'female', 'character', 'still', 'very', 'attractive', 'prior', 'hair', 'being', 'cut', 'off', 'anyway', 'just', 'so', 'rarely.The', 'film', 'perhaps', 'dragged', 'slightly', 'final', 'acts', 'only', 'briefly', 'also', 'hurt', 'slightly', 'underwhelming', 'perhaps', 'overly', 'happy', 'conclusion', 'how', 'do', 'finish', 'story', 'anyway', 'ending', 'comic', 'was', ""n't"", 'utterly', 'satisfactory', 'so', 'different', 'fairly', 'lateral', 'move.The', 'controversy', 'surrouding', 'film', 'fairly', 'stupid', 'Yes', 'Anti-Bush', ""'ve"", 'encountered', 'anti-Bush', 'sentiments', 'however', ""'m"", 'not', 'particularly', 'shocked', 'impressed', 'Yeah', 'protagonist', ""'terrorist"", 'just', 'how', 'vague', 'variable', 'language', 'up', 'couple', 'empty', 'buildings', 'kills', 'people', 'who', 'wronged', 'personally', 'attacking', 'government', 'legitmately', 'evil', 'managing', 'avoid', 'injuring', 'innocent', 'almost', 'entirely', 'short', 'more', 'subersive', 'thean', 'million', 'other', 'film', 'heroes', 'less', 'so', 'then', 'plenty.Yeah', ""'m"", 'done', 'entertaining', 'sometimes', 'enthralling', 'film', 'not', 'smart', 'deep', 'will', 'tell', 'smarter', 'most', 'major', 'films', 'suppose', 'always', 'watchable', 'what', 'really', 'matters.Grade', 'B']",N/A

As seems to be the case with movies made from graphic novels these days, the filmmakers did a great job of capturing the visual style of the comic while not necessarily retaining the story or underlying meaning. This was even more egregious in this case, where V is portrayed as a heroic figure whose victimization justifies the means by which he extracts his revenge with the added bonus of freeing the enslaved citizens of a nation. Sorry, but I think I understand why Alan Moore chose to remove his credit from the movie: in the graphic novel, the ending is ambiguous and serves to underscore the question of whether the means ever justifies the ends. The most effective sequence is Evie's torture and subsequent ""freedom,"" but the film breaks down in the last fifteen minutes where the directors fall back on hoary blockbuster tropes with slow-motion mega-violence and big blow-'em-ups. For a movie that wants you to take it seriously as part criticism of where the U.S. and the U.K. might be headed in the name of fighting terrorism, the ending betrays any thoughtfulness for spectacle.

176339,A3KGBMSG9ASVL,1419838830,Gozer,"[3, 12]","""V for Vendetta"" is not revolutionary, politically insightful or particularly original, despite the praise it's gotten.The film shows us a society of violent arrests, a big brotheresque government leader who addresses his henchmen over a giant video screen, and shadowy agents conducting surveillance. We're told the people willfully consented to a government that curbs their civil rights. We see troops in vaguely Nazi-looking uniforms parading before an all-powerful ""Chancellor"" and a media that's entirely government-controlled. And the director goes to great lengths to show us the horrors of British dentistry, especially when it comes to the bad guys.The fascit-like state is certainly not new ground for movies, so the twist is V himself -- a terrorist who fights the oppressive system and inspires people to rise up.But aside from a vague flashback in montage form and a few bits of dialogue, we're never told why or how the U.K. became a police state and how people became so frightened they allowed it to happen. This gap in the backstory becomes more obvious when V and the government each broadcast their own alternating propaganda to the British people -- we see a rotating series of shots that involve two or three families in their living rooms, a room full of elderly people in a nursing home, and some football fans in a pub, all watching the propaganda. The film cuts to the same people in the same shots over and over again as various pieces of propaganda are broadcast from opposing sides. The movie wants us to believe it's the future and these people are oppressed, but it looks like present-day England and the people seem to be having a good time -- those scenes could pass for commercials for Ikea or Miller Lite.V's own backstory seems like a bad rip-off of a Wolverine-style scientific experiment gone wrong, right on down to the unintentional side effect of a genetic mutation leading, conveniently, to really awesome superhuman fighting skills. And while the story goes to great lengths to show V as a feared -- but good -- terrorist, it glosses over the thorny issue of how a guy can run around detonating buildings without killing people. It's like the director and writers thought that would be too much moral ambiguity for audiences to chew on. There's also a fleeting reference to ""America's war"" over a visual of what looks like Iraq, and through a series of events the director doesn't explain, the mainland of the U.S. is reduced to smoldering ruins.While the parallels to today's world problems are facile, the acting is strong and the action plays out in a satisfying way. This film is proof that Natalie Portman can be not only credible in a sci-fi flick, but genuinely convincing -- and that the blame for her wooden performances in Star Wars should squarely rest on the shoulders of George Lucas and his ridiculous dialogue. As for Hugo Weaving, it's hard to imagine many other actors would be capable of bringing so much personality to a character who wears a mask for the entire movie. His performance was reminiscent of Edward Norton's masked king in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" except Alan Moore's story gives Weaving more to work with, and Weaving handles it perfectly.Overall, this film is a lot of fun as a sci-fi effort, but it is not the intelligent or profound commentary on society that some people mistake it for.",3,"Politically superficial, but still fun to watch",1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,3362,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'not', 'revolutionary', 'politically', 'insightful', 'particularly', 'original', 'praise', 'gotten.The', 'film', 'shows', 'society', 'violent', 'arrests', 'big', 'brotheresque', 'government', 'leader', 'who', 'henchmen', 'giant', 'video', 'screen', 'shadowy', 'agents', 'conducting', 'surveillance', ""'re"", 'told', 'people', 'willfully', 'consented', 'government', 'curbs', 'civil', 'rights', 'see', 'troops', 'vaguely', 'Nazi-looking', 'uniforms', 'parading', 'all-powerful', 'Chancellor', 'media', 'entirely', 'government-controlled', 'director', 'great', 'lengths', 'show', 'horrors', 'British', 'dentistry', 'especially', 'when', 'bad', 'guys.The', 'fascit-like', 'state', 'certainly', 'not', 'new', 'ground', 'movies', 'twist', 'V', 'terrorist', 'who', 'oppressive', 'system', 'people', 'rise', 'up.But', 'aside', 'vague', 'flashback', 'montage', 'form', 'few', 'bits', 'dialogue', ""'re"", 'never', 'told', 'why', 'how', 'U.K.', 'became', 'police', 'state', 'how', 'people', 'became', 'so', 'frightened', 'allowed', 'happen', 'gap', 'backstory', 'more', 'obvious', 'when', 'V', 'government', 'broadcast', 'own', 'alternating', 'propaganda', 'British', 'people', 'see', 'rotating', 'series', 'shots', 'involve', 'two', 'three', 'families', 'living', 'rooms', 'room', 'full', 'elderly', 'people', 'nursing', 'home', 'football', 'fans', 'pub', 'watching', 'propaganda', 'film', 'cuts', 'same', 'people', 'same', 'shots', 'over', 'again', 'various', 'pieces', 'propaganda', 'are', 'broadcast', 'opposing', 'sides', 'movie', 'believe', 'future', 'people', 'are', 'oppressed', 'present-day', 'England', 'people', 'seem', 'be', 'having', 'good', 'time', 'scenes', 'could', 'pass', 'commercials', 'Ikea', 'Miller', 'Lite.V', 'own', 'backstory', 'bad', 'rip-off', 'Wolverine-style', 'scientific', 'experiment', 'gone', 'wrong', 'right', 'unintentional', 'side', 'effect', 'genetic', 'mutation', 'leading', 'conveniently', 'really', 'awesome', 'superhuman', 'fighting', 'skills', 'story', 'great', 'lengths', 'show', 'V', 'feared', 'good', 'terrorist', 'thorny', 'issue', 'how', 'guy', 'can', 'run', 'around', 'detonating', 'buildings', 'killing', 'people', 'director', 'writers', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'too', 'much', 'moral', 'ambiguity', 'audiences', 'chew', 'also', 'fleeting', 'reference', 'America', 'war', 'visual', 'what', 'Iraq', 'series', 'events', 'director', ""n't"", 'explain', 'mainland', 'U.S.', 'reduced', 'smoldering', 'ruins.While', 'parallels', 'today', 'world', 'problems', 'are', 'facile', 'acting', 'strong', 'action', 'out', 'satisfying', 'way', 'film', 'proof', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'can', 'be', 'not', 'only', 'credible', 'sci-fi', 'flick', 'genuinely', 'convincing', 'blame', 'wooden', 'performances', 'Star', 'Wars', 'should', 'squarely', 'rest', 'shoulders', 'George', 'Lucas', 'ridiculous', 'dialogue', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'hard', 'imagine', 'many', 'other', 'actors', 'would', 'be', 'capable', 'bringing', 'so', 'much', 'personality', 'character', 'who', 'mask', 'entire', 'movie', 'performance', 'was', 'reminiscent', 'Edward', 'Norton', 'masked', 'king', 'Kingdom', 'Heaven', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'story', 'Weaving', 'more', 'work', 'Weaving', 'perfectly.Overall', 'film', 'lot', 'fun', 'sci-fi', 'effort', 'not', 'intelligent', 'profound', 'commentary', 'society', 'people', 'mistake']",N/A
176340,A1VJ7HYM1EC94M,1419838830,"G P Padillo ""paolo""","[772, 880]","""V for Vendetta"" is going to confuse a lot of people. Nevertheless, and make no mistake about it, this is movie making of the highest order, combining all the finest elements of great storytelling into a potent roller coaster of a movie filled with great action,intellect and above all, ideas.  Its message can - and will - easily be dismissed by naysayers as sophomoric or too ""out there,"" or ""anti-american"" but there is also an earnestness here that will resonate strongly, and perhaps, frighteningly, to many viewers who will not fail to see the correlation between this fictional tale and the way the world we live in works.Filled with stereotypes and archetypes, ""V"" is unapologetic in its essaying of morality and in its strongly held sentiment that this tale is ""for the people, by the people.""  Brothers and writers Larry and Andy Wachowski (of Matrix fame) have infused their screenplay with the anger, confusion and hope captured in Alan Moore's original graphic novel - and it's better looking as a result.I truly believe that many who see ""V"" will be upset by it, but hopefully more of us will be inspired by its bold, blatant message and take a good hard look at ourselves and the way the world works around us and see that, with sacrifice and thoughtfulness, the world can be changed.As Evey, Natalie Portman is cast in something of the ""victim"" role, but she makes us route for her, and to her credit she goes beyond that making the transformation of her character not only believable, but in the end, noble.Hugo Weaving - the man behind the mask - gives a performance that can only be described as mesmerizing.  As ""V"" he exposes all of the strength and weakness of a character that is equal parts savior and villain.The physical production is beautiful in its realism as it paints a nightmarish world of the not-very-distant future (2020) and is chilling in its depiction of governmental power, socio-political corruption and, ultimately, the complacency of its citizens.  Weaving's ""V"" challenges, and ultimately changes all of that, as he quickly unravels the fabric of civilized society, capturing the public with his bold ideas - and with the promise and permanancy of change through rebellion and political uprising.Most chillingly, the film invokes the dread once feared in ""1984"" but with a renewed vigor that drives home the horrors Orwell foresaw, and still loom large in our comfy modern world.  Chilling?  You betcha!  For those who know the novel, there is little skimping, and, given the current world situation, one must absolutely applaud the filmmakers for ""going there"" as far as the ending is concerned.  This is film making at its emotional and challenging best.Are there flaws?  Of course there are, but ultimately ""V for Vendetta"" rises far above them in its presentation of a world filled with ideas that have forever been debated, and does it in a story well told, beautifully acted and full of hope for humankind.

James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving)  appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine.  The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry.  One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government.  But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host.  Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film.  The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding!

176342,ACYPSCBCH4T3B,1419838830,Grant,"[1, 1]","It is hard to start at any particular point in describing V for Vendetta and just what type of movie it is. I could not specify the exact details of what you are supposed to know or comprehend at Vendetta's end. Some may think it was too preachy and some may think it is too sympathetic to the idea of terrorism and some may have thought it just plain sucked. All that aside here is what I thought about the movie. V for Vendetta's premise is somewhat simple to understand at first. It is set in England several years in the future and dark days have befallen the nation as a totalitarian government has taken over and ruled with fear and an iron fist. V the disfigured and vengeful hero who is out to make things right through any means necessary. But as it all unfolds realization quickly strikes that it is not nearly as simple as good versus evil it becomes a question of morality, how far is too far, and what is the justifiable cost of a revolution. Yes the story is grand and very well orchestrated and incredibly thought provoking. The title character V who is played to perfection by Hugo Weaving does a fantastic and memorable job portraying the masked revolutionary with his articulate language and firm belief that change must happen through any means necessary. Natalie Portman, though the painful memories of her playing Padme linger, manages to give a solid performance as Evey who ends up intertwined with V and his actions and is constantly at odds with herself as to whether what V is doing can be justified. One other memorable character in the movie is the detective who at the beginning of the movie is charged with hunting down V and how through his investigation into who V actually is he learns the government he has always been suspicious of yet loyal to has terrible secrets. These 3 characters in particular drive the movie .I wish the movies villains would have been a little better represented. Now what would a Wachowski brother's film be like without terrific action and slick special effects. V for Vendetta delivers big time in this department with terrific explosions and sensational fighting sequences that are brilliantly executed and an absolute blast to watch. The last one in particular truly is something to behold. One other cool aspect of the movie is how V's message spreads throughout the citizen's of England and how they are constantly getting closer and closer to going over the top and how much they want and believe in V's promise of freedom from repression. Though the movie has strong acting and fantastic action the movie would be nothing without the fantastic dialogue that perseveres throughout the entire movie.  Overall V for Vendetta is an excellent movie with superb action sequences and a tantalizing story that could make you question your own beliefs. It should be viewed with an open mind.

176343,A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ,1419838830,"Grimmy ""Grimmy""","[2, 6]","I liked the graphic novel. For all its philosophical and historical cluelessness, you could see Moore was an artist who was really trying, although supremely confused. But I just re-watched this, thinking I had enjoyed it somewhat the first time, and it was much less impressive than I remembered.It is so sad to see people praising this movie as ""thoughtful"" or ""smart."" It is a commentary on how badly our educational system has failed them. For those who are cognizant of actual current events and actual history know how muddled and confused this film is. The structure of the film itself is some action punctuating tedious sermons about the dangers of fascism and intolerance. It ""bravely"" casts Christianity as a danger and all others (including Islam) as victims.So this movie is a kind of ""opposite day"" in spades.To expound, anyone paying attention would see that, today, the only religion under constant persecution in mass media and actual, physical threat of death is, in fact, Christianity, from Hollywood to Burma, Africa, and various Communist states. They are routinely slaughtered by the villagefull with nary a peep from the press or the UN. The gay lifestyle is celebrated in the West. Apart from the odd exception, it is in fact Islamists who are burning the Bible and killing infidels. The media is not controlled by Rush Limbaugh, but his opposite numbers, and in staggering array. It is the Bible that gave rise, through long, painful birth pangs, to modern freedom, despite the failings and crimes of its followers, whereas anti-Church Darwinism, which Moore espouses, gave us the horrors of Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Che, et al. and their collective massacres, tortures, imprisonments and injustices in the name of progress. (Yep, surprise: the Hitler-Darwin connection is historically unassailable.)Opposite Day, indeed.In this alternate reality, all this is unknown. Indeed, to enjoy this movie, you have to purge your head of these realities. But that aside, and supposing an alternate history to justify this narrative, this film should be tedious even to the most ardent believer of these fictions. It hits you over the head in ham-handed heaviness, over and over again, with these eternal untruths. Long stretches of yakkety-yak to ensure that you are well inculcated with Opposite History are sprinkled liberally. Plot holes abound. Bad guys have protection details outsourced to the Keystone Cops.However, there is redemption. In their earnestness, the writers forgot to excise the pro-2nd Amendment message - governments should fear their peoples. The people should be armed to resist tyranny.Think on this, even if you loved this movie. What if, per this movie, armed, government-backed Limbaughites were knocking on your door in the middle of the night? You would want to be armed. Yes, the 2nd is meant to foil any sort of tyranny, whether from the Right or Left.The rest of this movie is self-righteous sermonizing and violent revenge fantasy. Bags of salt are advised. To those who still think this movie was ""smart"", I would suggest challenging your mind with something likeWhat's So Great about ChristianityorThe Devil's Delusion: Atheism and its Scientific Pretensions.

Americans really need to watch this one (before it is too late), the story about a mysterious hero named V, fighting a facist regime in a future England.The most incredible moment in the film is the speech V gives when he takes over a state-controlled television station - this speech should be broadcast on American prime-time TV, it gets right to the point.Don't be fooled by the ads for V, it is a drama, not an action film.

176348,A20FK68BUB1IVA,1419838830,Happy Reader,"[1, 1]","This is a review for ""V For Vendetta - Two-Disc Special Edition"", to give some information on the extras included with the movie.This is one of my family's favorite movies. It's exciting and it's stirring. Comic book but complex. Superbly filmed and acted, but then it had an amazing graphic novel to follow. Here's comments from participants in the DVD extras on this 2-disc Special Edition that echo my feelings about ""V for Vendetta"":Kevin Phipps, supervising art director: ""You don't really know were you are, in terms of time. It's almost as if creativity has stopped."" (extra #1)Daniel McTeigue, director: ""I think it's a political thriller, first and foremost. It is in the superhero genre, but it's also a play on that convention."" (Special Feature)John Hurt, who plays Adam Sutler: ""The themes are serious. I'm not sure the treatment is as serious as that. But on the other hand, if it was as serious as that, I'm not sure that it would reach the amount of people that it's intended to reach."" (Special Feature)Stephen Fry, who plays Dietrich: ""This is a movie about a terrorist. The hero is a terrorist. It's a very good ethical point, because as we all know, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" (Special Feature)Indeed, though I root for ""V"", he is not perfect. He wants the populace to stir themselves, stand up for themselves, and take their government back. But not until after he's had his vengeance.DISC NUMBER ONE:1.  The movie. Spoken languages available are the original English and dubbed French.  Subtitles available in English, French and Spanish.2.  Special Feature, 31 minutes: ""Freedom Forever! Making V for Vendetta"". This feature and extras 1, 2, and 3 were made at the same time. That is, when someone, such as the director, appears in more than one, you can tell that they were filmed at the same time. The extras compliment each other, rather than repeat each other. Interspersed with the interviews are film clips and production clips, too.Participants include James McTeigue, director, who says, ""I was the assistant director on the Matrix films. To live in the Matrix world is to know the graphic novel world.""DISC NUMBER TWO EXTRAS:1.  ""Designing the Near Future"", 9 minutes. Interesting stuff. The V mask was cast in fiberglass from a clay mold. It took the sculptor several tries. Most of the film was made at the Babelsberg Studio in Berlin. But there were crucial outdoor scenes that had to be filmed in England, such as at the end, where the mass of V's converge on Trafalgar Square on the 5th of November. It took 5 months to set up the 3 nights of filming; about 30 agencies/organizations had to give approval and/or co-ordinate.2.  ""Remember Remember: Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot"", 14 minutes. The history of the original gunpowder plot and how it's grown into an annual celebration in England. One interesting comment is by Sinead Cusack, who plays Delia Surridge. She was born in Dalkey, Ireland, and they have a different view of Guy Fawkes there.3.  ""England Prevails: V for Vendetta and The New Wave in Comics"", 24 minutes. This is about the comic book, or graphic novel. The camera-shy Alan Moore does not appear, but David Lloyd, who created the graphics for Moore's narrative, appears in several of the extras.Karen Berger, executive editor of Vertigo, DC's edgier more adult-oriented company says: ""V for Vendetta is in a class of its own. It's a brilliant piece of work. It's a commentary on society. At the time it was written, there was absolutely nothing being done like that.""The original comic book was published in black & white in England. Twenty-six issues were created before the publisher folded. Unfortunately, this was before V's story was finished!  Both Alan Moore and David Lloyd were subsequently hired by DC comics, who saw the genius, and published a complete version of ""V"" in color.4.  Cat Power Montage. This is like a song video. Clips of the movie are shown while Cat Powers sings ""I Found a Reason"", from The Covers Album (2000)5.  Soundtrack album info6.

Being a big fan of the Matrix films, I was eagerly anticipating the Wachowskis' next project. And for the next 130 minutes, I was blown away. Not only was the story intricate and engaging, the acting intense and convincing, the characters sympathetic and human, but the subtext of the film was unbelievable.At several points throughout the film my jaw dropped and I thought, ""Did they just say what I thought they said?"" I walked out of the theater elated and awed at what the filmmakers had created. I even had a moment of delusional optimism: ""Maybe people will GET it! This could be the movie that breaks the door down!"" But, like a sign from the great pessimist in the sky, my wishful thinking was promptly rebuked.Leaving the theater I overheard a man talking with his son. They, too, had just seen the movie. Surely, he had seen what I had seen; heard what I had heard. But no. ""It was a good movie,"" he said. ""But just remember, son, it's a movie, not real life."" I wanted to sock the guy in the face. How could a human see the movie and come away with such a pusillanimous and lily-livered response?What property of human stubbornness and ""thick-skulledness"" can misinterpret the line, ""artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up."" But I should know better. The human mind has a hyperactive and tenacious tendency to avoid uncomfortable conclusions.  Cognitive dissonance reigns supreme. If believing two contradictory pieces of information at the same time can prevent one from accepting an uncomfortable truth, our subconscious is more than willing to give us a hand.""No son, our government would never do such a thing.""

176358,A1QP5VCWEL1LHD,1419838830,"Humberto Mejia ""Still alive and kicking""","[0, 3]","This is a pleasant, provocative movie that is either an insult or satyre,  that I  have not discovered, or a manifestation of the collective aspirations of british fascism... as I learned by reading other reviewers, this movie comes from a graphic novel, so it does come from fertile ground for uncovering or exposing dark truths.Ideally this review should be read by having Pink Floyd's ""Waiting for the worms""  (from The Wall) as background and melody that repeats at certain intervals.""Would you like to see BritanniaRule again, my friend?All you have to do is follow the worms.Would you like to send our colored cousinsHome again, my friend?All you have to do is follow the worms.""So we are in Britannia some 30 years from present day. Unlike 1984, the dystopia state ruled by a fascist dictator (ironically played by John Hurt, which we all remember as Winston Smith in 1984 a movie censored nowdays) except that we are in a prosperous setting. If you look closely, this is not the multi-cultural London we know, if fact, this is a state where traditional anglo saxon virtues have been restored, it is George Bush's and all the neo conservatives dream land. What happened to the US? To me it was unclear, though a reviewer says that a brief hint in the movies makes it seem like it was destroyed in a civil war.Britannia is at this state in peace, the terrorist attacks of the past and the ""dark years that followed"" where unexplained purges took place, foreigners, islamics, homosexuals, dissenters were ""relocated"", disappeared or subjected to a series  of nazi like  human experiments where our mask hero seems to have acquired his feline, supernatural talents.Just for this setting, the movie should inspire us to reflect about the manipulative campaign of fear that today the USA and other powers are resorting to flirting with totalitarian ""selective"" methods. It is the Hobbean ruler that takes over the mind of the collective, which infinitely prefers totalitarism over anarchy. Even though the movie fails to create a coherent message of the rise of the new British fascism (apparently the only good thing that came out of this was the suppression of that bloody monarchy and all the pomp and circumstance that comes with it)  it does a good job at hinting, and showing us how over with time, homosexuals were persecuted, and islamophobic culture was instated, etc. (the racial cleansing or departures was apparently taboo even in this kind of setting, well, it is still Hollywood produced).But wait, our hero while using an English complot inspiration (some fellow who tried to blow up the parliament in the 17th century) is really a republican, Jeffersonian inspired... by being able to take over the only tv station in Britannia, he manages to wake up the conscience of the dormant herds that now yawn at their complacency in totalitarism, by inviting them for a sort of ""peaceful and collective"" resistance to the regime.When the bull smells, it smells, and the brits recognize the bull that the regime says right away, our hero is able to carry out his Count-of-Montecristo revenge against those who wronged him revelaing the putrid state of religion high rankers, scientist, etc. He picks up a girl (Portman) and teaches her how to face her fears until true courage emerges from the depths of despair.. in here there is a message to the young that is very appealing and I guess why the movie is so popular for the young (Note- if you are young and do not understand this review, read some books and get the facts before you start spewing out offensive comments, valid if you are old too).The message of hope spreads like wildfire and the promise to start a new order is achieved in a way that is rather weak to me, for the blowing of the parliament seems more like a terrorist dream than a protest that the true power resides in the people... the problems that the revolting brits do not seem to have much republican enthusiasm.So if you are doing a cinema forum investigating how modern freedom is being lost and want  some ignition fuel, this can be a good idea.",3,Political Satyre ?

176359,A2ICW5OUWX2A2V,1419838830,Ian,"[10, 14]","This could be the most dangerous movies of 2006.  How is that?  Well, for one thing it's main charachter is what you could call a terrorist.  Second, the film takes a hard look at the world as it may come to pass, a world where individuals set aside freedom in the name of security and peace.  If nothing else, V for Vendetta is the film that revolves around Benjamin Franklin's saying, ""They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.""V for Vendetta (VFV) is a creepy movie.  How so?  It shows just what could happen if Hitler and the Nazis suddenly returned, regained power and established a new dictatorship governement.  It's big brother for the twenty first century, and it's chilling.  The government is made up of cold and emotionless police and government agents who do thier job (kidnappings, beatings, etc.) with chilling efficency.  Propoganda is played on the television.  Curfews are in effect every night.  And let's not even start talking about the detainment centers...Seeing this big brother government of the twenty first century is chilling.  It resembles our current state of affairs pretty well, except for all the nasty dictator stuff.  The arrest scenes (where police break into homes and carry away ordinary people) are downright chilling.  This is NOT a place you want to live.  Yet it's a fascinating look at what may happen.  The story takes place sometime in the early-mid twenty first century.  The united states has broken up into civil war over the war in the middle east which has lasted for decades.  Religious fanatics have poisioned thousands in Briton.  The movie is a fascinating study into how fear will make people do crazy things to feel safe again (such as elect power hungry maniacs who promise peace).  At one point early on, V (the title charachter) tells the public to simply look in a mirror to see who is responsible for what has happened.It is because of this that VFV is a warning to us, that if we give in to fear, this just might happen.  But it doesn't stop there.  Oh, no, it doesn't stop there by a long shot.VFV is very deep on many levels.  When you see it the first time, you can tell that there's a lot here, yet you only get a glimpse at it.  When you see it a second time, you get a better grasp of the messages being put forth, yet there is still more to see and more to discover.  In many ways VFV is like the first matrix movie.  The deeper you go into the rabbit hole, the more you are going to find. There's even a great idea behind V's mask and his face, but i'll let you figure that one out for yourself (it's fantastic, I will say that much).Arguably the best part of the entire film is V himself.  Not since Hellboy has the silver screen seen such a fascinating comic book charachter come to life.  V is intriguing, a very polite gentleman (when he's not out killing people), a fan of movies, a good cook (very amusing scene by the way), and always has that oh-so charming smile on his face (granted it's a mask, but it works so well).  His actions make him a Han solo charachter, not totally good, not totally bad.  He can be both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, depending upon how you see his actions.  Which one is he?  The movie lets you decide that for yourself, though it does lean towards freedom fighter.  With his charming personality, black cape, black hat and that awesome mask, V is an utterly fascinating charachter who is a delight to watch.The movie even touches upon the subjects of religion and homosexuality in a way that can best be described as creepy.  Because religious fanatics (the film does not say what faith these fanatics were) have apparently done so much damage that religions are now completly banned.  The issue of how homosexuals are treated is truly disturbing.  In this horrible future, homosexuals are routinely arrested and have all sorts of...well, i'll let you see for yourself. It is my hope that this world does not descend to this level of barbaric cruelty.While VFV may be a movie about revolution, dont go in expecting lots of action.  This is a movie about ideas (this is one of the main themes) and how ideas affect people.  That's not to say that there is no action, for there are some really well done sequences (especially a big fight near the end where V really gets to show off his fighting ability with knives).  There's also some very cool shots of huge crowds at the climax, though i'll let you see that for yourself.Even with all the gloominess and dictatorship going around, VFV does have some very effective humor sprinkled in.  There's a fantastic moment where V cooks breakfast for Evey, and there's an absoloutly hilarious TV special halfway through the movie that had me laughing in the theater.  It's so funny that it would be a crime to reveal what it is, so i'll let you find out for yourself.In the end, VFV is a movie about ideas.  What can happen to those who are afraid, and how ideas are things that you cannot control or kill (""Underneath this mask is a face and underneath that is muscles and bone.  Yet I am more then that"").  It's a very thought provoking movie, one that is chillingly familiar to those of us living in this age of homeland security and the conflict with terrorism.

176360,A192KEPM0HW6AC,1419838830,"Interplanetary Funksmanship ""Swift lippin', e...","[9, 31]","Much more hilarious than Thank You for Smoking--though unintentionally so--is V for Vendetta, the latest installment of the Wachowski brothers's downward slide into formulaic banality. Directed by James McTeigue, the veteran first assistant director of such fare as Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones and the Matrix trilogy, V is his first directing effort in which nobody but himself can be blamed for monumental ineptness.Upon its release, V for Vendetta sparked a lot of debate among libertarians and Objectivists about its anarchistic and nihilistic themes, and from that vantage point I was prepared to write this review. Easier said than done. After viewing nearly all four hours of this CGI special effects extravaganza (during which, inexplicably, the hands on my watch moved only two hours and twelve minutes), I scarcely found any dialogue coherent enough to be debated.Set in the England of the future, V for Vendetta centers around its ""hero,"" V, played by Hugo Weaving. V is a refined man of culture (after all, who doesn't enjoy hearing Julie London sing ""Cry Me a River""?), who surrounds himself with now-banned books. For you see, the great Fortress has been taken over by ""Norsefire,"" a fascist theocracy. Its leader, Chancellor Adam Sutler, is a neo-conservative turned Big Brother, played by John Hurt. Just so the subtle novelty of a fuming and spitting despot who governs by Jumbotron isn't lost on the viewer, the makeup people made certain to give Hurt a shortish-cropped mustache and a slicked-back shock of hair reminiscent of a certain Austrian corporal we all know and love.Against this repressive backdrop, V nurses a four-hundred-year-old chip on his shoulder about the hanging of Guy Fawkes, who in 1605 tried to blow up the British Parliament. V also has a laundry list of personal grudges: he survived a secret government biological warfare experiment gone awry, as well as burns over one hundred percent of his body.All of this is meant to guarantee the viewer's sympathy for V's sociopathic killing spree as a knife-wielding assassin and mad bomber. After curfew, he prowls London's streets, avenging Norsefire's innocent victims. He hides behind a plaster Guy Fawkes mask, which appears rather stiff, though not as stiff as Weaving's acting.V happens upon our damsel-in-distress, Evey Hammond, played by the waifish Natalie Portman, whom he rescues from a back-alley rape at the hands of the curfew police, in a deftly-choreographed, computer-generated bloodletting by stainless-steel daggers that produce the requisite ""swoosh"" and ""chunk"" sound effects. V sure moves pretty fast and furious for someone who's suffered one-hundred-percent body burns. According to the actuarial tables, he shouldn't be moving at all; but that's a moot point.After dispensing with the goon squad, V introduces himself to Evey by way of an alliterative soliloquy containing forty-seven words beginning with the letter ""V."" It's meant to be charming and chivalrous, but comes off more like Snidely Whiplash doing a Jesse Jackson impression. V then asks Evey to accompany him for a night on the town, whereupon he blows up that citadel of British jurisprudence, the Old Bailey. Talk about fireworks on a first date!The next day, the government takes credit for his dynamiting job, claiming that Old Bailey was condemned as unsafe. Unfortunately, another side effect that V suffered in prison was an abiding and strident narcissism; so he takes over television broadcast studios to inform Londoners that he blew up Old Bailey, and that in one year--on the day Guy Fawkes burns in effigy--he will level Parliament. Through another subtle plot twist--Evey just happens to work as a gofer at the TV studio (surprise!)--V manages to sweep her up as his innocent accomplice. This sets up the tedium that follows, right up to the anticipated anticlimactic climax.V for Vendetta doesn't just rip off George Orwell's 1984; that would imply some sort of thematic unity. Rather, this schizophrenic action pic is a pastiche of at least a dozen works far greater than itself. When not squiring Evey about his secret lair a l&aacute; The Phantom of the Opera, V hunts down the bastards responsible for his fate in pale homage to The Count of Monte Cristo, while inciting the people to take back their country in a side plot embarrassingly reminiscent of that other ""V""--the 1983 TV mini-series about invading aliens from outer space. The film snitches from cinematic styles and genres, too. There's even a flashback that seamlessly melds the innocence of awakening lesbian passion with lush Merchant-Ivory cinematography from the 1920s.Amidst all the slow-mo slicing and dicing, V is fond of chiding his deserving prey that ""ideas do matter."" In his televised appeal to the people, he lays the blame for their loss of liberty where it properly belongs, at their own feet. The film's tagline--""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""--is a rather Jeffersonian conception that rings with the spirit of limited government.Yet for all its nods to individual liberty, V for Vendetta fetishizes freedom through its direct advocacy of anarchy. Justifying his annihilation of Parliament, V argues that ""the world doesn't need a building, it needs an idea""--patently ignoring the ideas of common law and representative democracy that very building embodies. Thus we are brought to V's conclusion: By destroying the betrayed institutions of democracy, somehow, the people will regain their freedom.This is an obscenity to anyone who remembers his World War II history. From Parliament's halls, Winston Churchill rallied Britons in their ""finest hour"" to face down Hitler's Third Reich on the eve of the Battle of Britain. In their sick revision, however, the Wachowskis defeat the Nazis by leveling Parliament--never mind the fact that the Nazis burned down the Germans' Reichstag to consolidate power.Despite V's pompously vague appeals to the power of ideas, all that viewers are left with is a lot of the moral relativity piffle that leftist professors are so fond of quoting, to the effect that ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter."" Substitute the World Trade Center and the Pentagon for Old Bailey and Parliament, and you'll get the drift of this sickening allegory.Or, to drive the point closer to home, substitute, in Parliament's place, Columbine High School in suburban Denver. Before the murderous rage in which Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris massacred twelve schoolmates and a teacher, they produced an amateur video glorifying their school's wanton and nihilistic destruction.Thankfully, they took their own sorry lives immediately thereafter. Imagine what cinematic epics Klebold and Harris might have scripted from their prison cells. Their insane musings wouldn't have looked much different from this nauseating waste of celluloid.",2,V for Vacuous,1179619200,"05 20, 2007",2007,6918,"['Much', 'more', 'hilarious', 'Thank', 'Smoking',

Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always - today - in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer.

V is a fine example of mode-against-type, since he never takes off his mask, and is all the more powerful for that.

This is the best comic series that has ever been. And may ever be. It doesn't just edge out its competitors (DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, BATMAN: YEAR ONE, ARKHAM ASYLUM, even Moore's other works like THE KILLING JOKE, WATCHMEN, SWAMP THING, and FROM HELL), it blows them away. The tale is the best example of fiction writing in any category. David Lloyd's art doesn't hurt either. It's brilliant and atmospheric. The writing is supremely intelligent, caustic, incendiary, touching, challenging, disturbing and witty.But here, we're talking about the film.And the film leaves you wanting.I'm not going to get too far into the plot of the film, because everyone else already has. I will, however, go into my criticisms of the film.Obviously, this is going to come under fire from some people who will read this because of the following criticism: Too much has changed from the comic to the screen.

Interesting that he hooks up with the Wachowski brothers again. After the over hyped over baked and finally collapsed souffle that was Matrix 3 I wouldn't want to associate myself with them anytime soon.Here Mr Weaving spends the entire picture a Guy Faulks mask.  Any lesser actor would have been rendered into a basket case. Without his face to fill in the nuance of his character Weaving must use his voice and body to fill in the blanks.  Well to quote the W ""mission accomplished""Weaving gives voice, passion, soul and believability to V.Weaving is supported by Natalie Portman, forget the poorly drawn caricature that was princess forgettable in Star Wars 1,2 and 3. Given a good premise and real character development  she soars in V. This is because she has real actors to play against and well written script.  Yup sci fi really works when it's not written by a hack who is way too fond of his CGI toys.Let me not forget Steven Rea's contribution either, his world weary Inspector is spot on.  His hound dog face extends to his character hound dog persistence.  While he is there to drive the story along and give some of the background on V he never falls into the realm of cliche.  You feel his pain and understand his persistence.  He is (belatedly) searching for the truth behind his government and ultimately his life.Also contributing to cause it John Hurt and a truly wonderful score.  Set design and lighting are well thought out too.  The lighting has to do double duty as it has to help Weaving express the correct emotion. Remember that Weaving is acting behind a rather silly mask so lighting and cinematography have to be spot on, there is no room for error.The only real weakness in V is the premise itself. No not that the UK has slipped into fascist terror state.  Both the UK and US are just few ""Allah Akbar""s from that terrible future.  No it is that one person in a Guy Faulks mask pulls a somnolent public back to a freedom loving mass of citizenry in only one year.

They bring a depth to the material through their acting that would otherwise be very much lacking. Portman's finely felt work here as the heroine Evey is a revelation, given her woodenness in the recent Star Wars trilogy, but the real acting honors must go to Weaving, who wears a plastic Guy Fawkes mask thoughout the entire film in his role as the dashing Shakespeare-quoting freedom fighter (or terrorist, depending on your perspective): all his acting has to be done without the benefit of facial expression, and damned if Weaving doesn't make an actor's showcase of of the part nonetheless and invest it with multiple dimensions.The concept of both the film and the graphic novel involves the political resistance of a masked swashbuckler in a totalitarian Britain of the very near future: its resonances in the wake of 9/11 and the Patriot Act are quite strong. The film's visuals are actually a bit heavyhanded: the evil High Chancellor (John Hurt, in an atypical scenery-chewing performance) communicates with his council of lackeys via closed-circuit TV in scenes reminiscent of the famous ""1984"" Apple Super Bowl commercial, while his rise to power is documented in clips that almost exactly evoke the Nuremberg rallies documented in ""Triumph of the Will."" The film's scenic designer seems to have felt his audience would be so dim that even THAT wouldn't be enough, and so the Chancellor's Norsefire Party uses as a color scheme black with red accents, as in a Satanic Black Mass. But the intelligence behind Alan moore's original conception for the work overrides this, and Weaving and Portman greatly redeem the material. This special 2-disc DVD features a short on the making of the film's visual look (the producers and director and scenic director seem intent on convincing us that what they've done with it really brilliant, which seems funny in a film all about propaganda), another on the original Moore/Lloyd graphic novel and the new wave of comics, and a third on the historical underpinnings of this film in the Gunpowder Plot and Guido ""Guy"" Fawkes.",3,Try to Remember the Kind of November,1174262400,"03 19, 2007",2007,2227,"['best', 'things', 'literate', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'Moore/Lloyd', 'graphic', 'novel', 'are', 'stars', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'bring', 'depth', 'material', 'acting', 'would', 'otherwise', 'be', 'very', 'much', 'lacking', 'Portman', 'finely', 'felt', 'work', 'here', 'heroine', 'Evey', 'revelation', 'given', 'woodenness', 'recent', 'Star', 'Wars', 'trilogy', 'real', 'acting', 'honors', 'must', 'go', 'Weaving', 'who', 'plastic', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'mask', 'entire', 'film', 'role', 'dashing', 'Shakespeare-quoting', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'terrorist', 'depending', 'perspective', 'acting', 'be', 'done', 'benefit', 'facial', 'expression', 'damned', 'Weaving', ""n't"", 'make', 'actor', 'showcase', 'part', 'nonetheless', 'invest', 'multiple', 'dimensions.The', 'concept', 'film', 'graphic', 'novel', 'political', 'resistance', 'masked', 'swashbuckler', 'totalitarian', 'Britain', 'very', 'near', 'future', 'resonances', 'wake', '9/11', 'Patriot', 'Act', 'are', 'quite', 'strong', 'film', 'visuals', 'are', 'actually', 'bit', 'heavyhanded', 'evil', 'High', 'Chancellor', 'John', 'Hurt', 'atypical', 'scenery-chewing', 'performance', 'council', 'lackeys', 'closed-circuit', 'TV', 'scenes', 'reminiscent', 'famous', '1984', 'Apple', 'Super', 'Bowl', 'commercial', 'rise', 'power', 'documented', 'clips', 'almost', 'exactly', 'evoke', 'Nuremberg', 'rallies', 'documented', 'Triumph', 'Will', 'film', 'scenic', 'designer', 'have', 'felt', 'audience', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'dim', 'even', 'THAT', 'would', ""n't"", 'be', 'enough', 'so', 'Chancellor', 'Norsefire', 'Party', 'color', 'scheme', 'black', 'red', 'accents', 'Satanic', 'Black', 'Mass', 'intelligence', 'Alan', 'moore', 'original', 'conception', 'work', 'Weaving', 'Portman', 'greatly', 'redeem', 'material', 'special', '2-disc', 'DVD', 'short', 'making', 'film', 'visual', 'look', 'producers', 'director', 'scenic', 'director', 'seem', 'intent', 'convincing', 'what', ""'ve"", 'done', 'really', 'brilliant', 'funny', 'film', 'propaganda', 'original', 'Moore/Lloyd', 'graphic', 'novel', 'new', 'wave', 'comics', 'third', 'historical', 'underpinnings', 'film', 'Gunpowder', 'Plot', 'Guido', 'Guy', 'Fawkes']",N/A

176390,A140XH16IKR4B0,1419838830,Jean E. Pouliot,"[0, 2]","Reading ""V for Vendetta"" (the graphic novel) was such an overwhelming experience that one could be forgiven for wishing fervently that a movie adaptation *not* be made. But the Wachowski Brothers have done a fantastic job of bringing the story to cinema.The story's main elements are here. Britain is a police state controlled by a fanatical and puritanical elite. The media is nothing but the propaganda arm of the government. And it is a government with much to hide. Into this repressive atmosphere comes ""V,"" a terrorist bomber who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, black cape, broad brimmed hat, leggings and gloves, who spouts Shakespeare while staging elaborate explosions. The government needs to track him down before another ""November, November, the fifth of the November"" arrives, with more detonations and (more important) the possible toppling of their rule.Lovers of the graphic novel will recognize most of the main plot elements, which shall not be detailed here but which involve nazi-like concentration camps, medical experiments on humans and an attempt to suppress all but the most banal art and literature. A few plot and character changes tweaks don't disrupt the overall flow of the film. Evey, V's young protege, played with great expressiveness by Natalie Portman, is much smarter and more self-aware than in the novel. The number of government characters and spurned lovers, so hard to keep track of in the novel, have been pared down and made more recognizable.Most importantly, many of the novel's messages and insights have been retained -- the population pacified with a constant stream of TV amusements; the fear based on lies; the deep-seated need for freedom, the love of beauty, whether literary, religious or musical or visual. The parallels to the present are intentional. The only thing of any consequence that was missing (as far as I could tell) was the name of Alan Moore, who wrote the novel. ""V"" purists will no doubt dislike the ending, where most of the film's changes occur. Because of the paring down of extraneous characters, necessary actions have been shifted to other characters. Most of these shifts become apparent in the last 1/2 hour of the film. I'm no purist, and I thought this worked well.""V for Vendetta"" is well worth the watch -- it is finely-crafted, well-written and superbly acted. Hugo Weaving (Elrond in Lord of the Rings) as ""V"" never showed his faced, but conveyed a broad range of emotions. His voice, soft and lyrical, yet capable of conveying menace, was perfect. And Stephen Rea, as the conflicted Inspector Finch, gave a restrained and effective performance.The DVD extra were mainly limited to a short ""making of"" feature that included so-so interviews with the actors and a few behind he scenes shots showing wire work and rehearsals. Nothing earth-shattering. While not completely conveying the darkness, sense of dread of the book on which it was based, nor its complexity, nor the mad lust for vengeance that propelled V on his murderous rampage, ""V for Vendetta"" was about as perfect an adaptation as could be hoped for. Readers of the novel should see the movie, and movie viewers should read the novel to get the full effect of this marvelous ode against the excesses of authoritarians and the fear that puts them, and keeps them, in power.",5,A Phenomenal Adaptation,1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2007,3312,"['Reading', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'graphic', 'novel', 'was', 'such', 'overwhelming', 'experience', 'one', 'could', 'be', 'forgiven', 'wishing', 'fervently', 'movie', 'adaptation', '*not*', 'be', 'made', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'have', 'done', 'fantastic', 'job', 'bringing', 'story', 'cinema.The', 'story', 'main', 'elements', 'are', 'here', 'Britain', 'police', 'state', 'controlled', 'fanatical', 'puritanical', 'elite', 'media', 'nothing', 'propaganda', 'arm', 'government', 'government', 'much', 'hide', 'Into', 'repressive', 'atmosphere', 'V', 'terrorist', 'bomber', 'who', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'mask', 'black', 'cape', 'broad', 'brimmed', 'hat', 'leggings', 'gloves', 'who', 'Shakespeare', 'staging', 'elaborate', 'explosions', 'government', 'track', 'down', 'November', 'November', 'fifth', 'November', 'more', 'detonations', 'more', 'important', 'possible', 'toppling', 'rule.Lovers', 'graphic', 'novel', 'will', 'recognize', 'most', 'main', 'plot', 'elements', 'shall', 'not', 'be', 'detailed', 'here', 'involve', 'nazi-like', 'concentration', 'camps', 'medical', 'experiments', 'humans', 'attempt', 'suppress', 'most', 'banal', 'art', 'literature', 'few', 'plot', 'character', 'changes', 'tweaks', 'do', ""n't"", 'disrupt', 'overall', 'flow', 'film', 'Evey', 'V', 'young', 'protege', 'played', 'great', 'expressiveness', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'much', 'smarter', 'more', 'self-aware', 'novel', 'number', 'government', 'characters', 'spurned', 'lovers', 'so', 'hard', 'keep', 'track', 'novel', 'have', 'been', 'pared', 'down', 'made', 'more', 'recognizable.Most', 'importantly', 'many', 'novel', 'messages', 'insights', 'have', 'been', 'retained', 'population', 'pacified', 'constant', 'stream', 'TV', 'amusements', 'fear', 'based', 'lies', 'deep-seated', 'need', 'freedom', 'love', 'beauty', 'literary', 'religious', 'musical', 'visual', 'parallels', 'present', 'are', 'intentional', 'only', 'thing', 'consequence', 'was', 'missing', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'was', 'name', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'who', 'wrote', 'novel', 'V', 'purists', 'will', 'doubt', 'ending', 'where', 'most', 'film', 'changes', 'occur', 'paring', 'extraneous', 'characters', 'necessary', 'actions', 'have', 'been', 'shifted', 'other', 'characters', 'Most', 'shifts', 'become', 'apparent', 'last', '1/2', 'hour', 'film', ""'m"", 'purist', 'thought', 'worked', 'well', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'well', 'worth', 'watch', 'finely-crafted', 'well-written', 'superbly', 'acted', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Elrond', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'V', 'never', 'showed', 'faced', 'conveyed', 'broad', 'range', 'emotions', 'voice', 'soft', 'lyrical', 'yet', 'capable', 'conveying', 'menace', 'was', 'perfect', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'conflicted', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'gave', 'restrained', 'effective', 'performance.The', 'DVD', 'extra', 'were', 'mainly', 'limited', 'short', 'making', 'feature', 'included', 'so-so', 'interviews', 'actors', 'few', 'shots', 'showing', 'wire', 'work', 'rehearsals', 'Nothing', 'earth-shattering', 'not', 'completely', 'conveying', 'darkness', 'sense', 'dread', 'book', 'was', 'based', 'complexity', 'mad', 'lust', 'vengeance', 'propelled', 'V', 'murderous', 'rampage', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'was', 'perfect', 'adaptation', 'could', 'be', 'hoped', 'Readers', 'novel', 'should', 'see', 'movie', 'movie', 'viewers', 'should', 'read', 'novel', 'get', 'full', 'effect', 'marvelous', 'ode', 'excesses', 'authoritarians', 'fear', 'power']",N/A

There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask?This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is. The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout, a few slow moments, and an apocalyptic future setting that really heightens the tension with starkly dark set design and stunning cinematography. There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison in the film. And it made the film even more direct.Hidden behind the creepy mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor. His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystrophic future, and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance. Portman on the other hand also excels, with a convincing accent. She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well. The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled. The rest of the film is great in its execution. The climax, especially, was uplifting and will live on to be the most memorable conclusion. The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.I'm going to say that it's nothing short of its brilliance. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.

Portman was believable in her emotion, and Weaving was great at portraying emotion even with his face concealed by a mask.  But for me, that's where it ends.I do not understand the opinion of who say this movie is 'thought-provoking' or 'deep' in any sense.  It has been pointed out in previous reviews, that right-wingers are the only ones finding any thing wrong with this movie, because it offends their political views.  Now, I'm not a conservative, but could it also be said that left-wing people find it enjoyable because it somehow supports their beliefs?First of all, the 'hero' wears the mask of a religious extremist himself.  How ironic is that?  A brief history lesson of Guy Fawkes will tell you that he tried to blow up the House of Lords not to gain 'freedom' for the masses, but because Fawkes was a Catholic and James I was a Protestant.So V tries to free everyone through violence, and in the end, he leaves everyone else to clean up the mess and fill the power vacuum that is left behind.  Just like a terrorist.  Create mayhem and destruction for thier own views, and leave the rest of us to pick up the pieces and move on.  This movie was juvenile in its themes and ideas, most notably that the UK would ever be ruled by a Christian regime.

Apparently, when Fascism finally comes to Britain its main policy goals will be to outlaw homosexuality and Korans.

The characters were fascinating, and my only real problem with the movies is that many of them were never really developed or revealed.Several people have mentioned to me that they were outraged that V, the main character, was glorified erroneously, that that the movie glorifies terrorism.  While any person who fights a government with violence might be billed as a terrorist (especially by said governement), V seems to focus all of his retribution on members of, and symbols of the facist regime.  He seems to go out of his way to avoid harm to civilians, and it is that tie to his essential humanity that sets him apart as more than just a terrorist.The dialogue and cinimatography in this movie were beautiful, and I found the story's intelligence a breath of fresh air after the parade of tripe that Hollywood had inundated me with lately.While some of my conservative friends rail against this as anti-bush/republican, and my liberal friends hail this as a return to the sixties, I find myself disagreeing with both sets.  This movie targets totalitarianism and intolerant governments more than any one specific regime, and I found the anti-establishment message harkened far less to the marijuana hazed sixties sentiments than to the American revolutionary war.The message was delivered masterly, and while the movie had its share of violence, it was delivered with tasteful effectiveness instead of the sensory saturation 'gross-out' that marks the average modern action movie.This is a movie that will hopefully make you thoughtfull, and act as a warning to the dangers of doing nothing and allowing any government or group to manipulate you with fear.

Evey is not sure whether to love him or fear him.The setting is future England (2020), and is not overly futuristic.

Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say ""republicans are evil bla bla bla"" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.V for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it.",5,not what i expected.,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,2682,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'was', 'certainly', 'not', 'what', 'expected', 'Instead', 'getting', 'face', 'action', 'flick', 'do', 'gooder', 'get', 'political', 'film', 'oppressive', 'government', 'using', 'fear', 'tactics', 'keep', 'people', 'control', 'V', 'out', 'stop', 'V', 'really', 'heroic', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'are', 'led', 'believe', 'Or', 'become', 'evil', 'Who', 'V', 'just', 'random', 'guy', 'lunatic', 'Eve', 'father', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'know', 'even', 'end', 'movie', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'clue.V', 'Vendetta', 'set', 'near', 'future', 'London', 'England', 'Something', 'happened', 'left', 'United', 'States', 'ruins', 'rest', 'world', 'poverty', 'England', 'evil', 'fanatic', 'seized', 'control', 'government', 'using', 'fear', 'terrorist', 'diesis', 'new', 'leader', 'able', 'keep', 'people', 'iron', 'grip', 'not', 'total', 'nightmare', 'government', 'way', 'Gorge', 'Orwell', '1984', 'was', 'give', 'time', 'could', 'get', 'way', 'Than', 'out', 'where', 'V', 'who', 'message', 'hope', 'start', 'revolution', 'overthrow', 'government', 'tactic', 'destroy', 'parliament', 'kill', 'dictator.Obviously', 'movie', 'very', 'political', 'not', 'easily', 'offended', 'can', 'not', 'stand', 'people', 'challenging', 'views', 'means', 'skip', 'move', 'will', 'just', 'make', 'faint', 'anyway', 'Save', 'aggravation', 'rest', 'who', 'debating', 'other', 'peoples', 'views', 'instead', 'slandering', 'amazing', 'film', 'True', 'fact', 'talk', 'Bush', 'administration', 'war', 'terror', 'reasonable', 'people', 'will', 'not', 'go', 'out', 'slander', 'movie', 'just', 'am', 'republican', 'Christian', 'who', 'gay', 'marriage', 'movie', 'pointed', 'things', 'say', 'government', 'far', 'right', 'extremist', 'group', 'actions', 'somehow', 'saying', 'will', 'God', 'murder', 'Muslims', 'gay', 'forbid', 'religion', 'Christianity', 'try', 'justify', 'what', 'are', 'doing', 'movie', ""n't"", 'just', 'say', 'republicans', 'are', 'evil', 'bla', 'bla', 'bla', 'make', 'point', 'very', 'well', 'written', 'way', 'Muslims', 'gays', 'are', 'seen', 'people', 'instead', 'enemies', 'so', 'many', 'people', 'seem', 'think', 'are', 'Extreme', 'right', 'wing', 'Christian', 'fanatics', 'are', 'seen', 'just', 'dangeres', 'Muslim', 'extremist', 'fact', 'are', 'course', 'movie', 'slant', 'left', 'have', 'good', 'message', 'do', ""n't"", 'ever', 'give', 'up', 'freedom', 'matter', 'what', 'Do', 'not', 'allow', 'government', 'use', 'fear', 'tactics', 'scare', 'letting', 'up', 'liberties', 'Never', 'stop', 'fighting', 'must', 'die', 'what', 'believe.V', 'Vendetta', 'very', 'good', 'film', 'do', 'favor', 'go', 'see']",N/A
176414,A33CLVW2K7SL1P,1419838830,Jonathan Appleseed,"[54, 68]","Until reading other reviews on this site, I wasn't aware that ""V for Vendetta"" was adapted from a graphic novel, and certainly not aware that the author/illustrator was unhappy with the finished product. This happens so often when Hollywood gets their hands on something, and I'm wondering when they'll learn. While it's true that movies can't be word for word translations of books, nor image by image, they can still be true to the story. The only reason stories (I'm using that as a very broad term) are made into films is because the story invoked passion of some kind in its readers. Too often, Hollywood either doesn't understand what passions were invoked in the reader, how to translate those to film, or dismisses them entirely. However, oftentimes a story is far too complex, contains too many character, too many divergent plot lines, or too many ideas for a proper translation to occur. When that happens, we either find a script that cuts to the core of the story and eliminates anything that isn't absolutely essential to the story. That's where everybody has difficulty. Hollywood and the fans of the story rarely agree on what was left out, what was left in, what was enhanced - what was essential.It seems, according to reviews here, that the film remained essentially true to its core, and trimmed around the edges. That said, many here disagree vehemently.That served me fine. I didn't find gaping holes or questions, and never felt that any plot line was hurried. The film presented radical ideas in a magnificent fashion, first through a very unlikely hero (whose creation was, as usual, tragic), and second through the establishment he was fighting against.""V"" was pursuing two things in the film. 1) To bring down the establishment, which had become increasingly totalitarian, and 2) to make those responsible for his creation pay.Both are radical, subversive, and vigilante in nature. Some have said that ""V"" is a terrorist, and in a sense, he certainly is. This is no Batman, no Spider-Man, and certainly no Superman. He is not a crusader for good, and possesses his own set of ethics - undoubtedly burned into him in his birth. While I personally can't agree with his tactics, I never found myself rooting against him. The ""system"" that was in place was a horrid one, and it did need to be brought down - especially by someone who himself had been ""brought down"" by the system.The acting is first rate, as are the special effects.As I noted in the first paragraph, stories are made into film because the story invoked passion of some sort. This film certainly evoked passion in me. It's a terrifying reminder that totalitarian regimes have existed, that some have been created virtually overnight, and how perilously close we are now to slipping backward, instead of forward.",4,A Dance with Vigilantism,1168300800,"01 9, 2007",2007,2801,"['reading', 'other', 'reviews', 'site', 'was', ""n't"", 'aware', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'was', 'adapted', 'graphic', 'novel', 'certainly', 'not', 'aware', 'author/illustrator', 'was', 'unhappy', 'finished', 'product', 'so', 'often', 'when', 'Hollywood', 'hands', 'something', ""'m"", 'wondering', 'when', ""'ll"", 'learn', 'true', 'movies', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'word', 'word', 'translations', 'books', 'image', 'image', 'can', 'still', 'be', 'true', 'story', 'only', 'reason', 'stories', ""'m"", 'using', 'very', 'broad', 'term', 'are', 'made', 'films', 'story', 'invoked', 'passion', 'kind', 'readers', 'Too', 'often', 'Hollywood', 'either', ""n't"", 'understand', 'what', 'passions', 'were', 'invoked', 'reader', 'how', 'translate', 'film', 'entirely', 'However', 'story', 'far', 'too', 'complex', 'too', 'many', 'character', 'too', 'many', 'divergent', 'plot', 'lines', 'too', 'many', 'ideas', 'proper', 'translation', 'occur', 'When', 'either', 'find', 'script', 'core', 'story', 'anything', ""n't"", 'absolutely', 'essential', 'story', 'where', 'everybody', 'difficulty', 'Hollywood', 'fans', 'story', 'rarely', 'agree', 'was', 'left', 'out', 'what', 'was', 'left', 'what', 'was', 'enhanced', 'what', 'was', 'essential.It', 'according', 'reviews', 'here', 'film', 'remained', 'essentially', 'true', 'core', 'trimmed', 'edges', 'said', 'many', 'here', 'disagree', 'vehemently.That', 'served', 'fine', 'did', ""n't"", 'find', 'gaping', 'holes', 'questions', 'never', 'felt', 'plot', 'line', 'was', 'hurried', 'film', 'presented', 'radical', 'ideas', 'magnificent', 'fashion', 'first', 'very', 'unlikely', 'hero', 'creation', 'was', 'usual', 'tragic', 'second', 'establishment', 'was', 'fighting', 'V', 'was', 'pursuing', 'two', 'things', 'film', '1', 'bring', 'down', 'establishment', 'had', 'become', 'increasingly', 'totalitarian', '2', 'make', 'responsible', 'creation', 'pay.Both', 'are', 'radical', 'subversive', 'vigilante', 'nature', 'have', 'said', 'V', 'terrorist', 'sense', 'certainly', 'Batman', 'Spider-Man', 'certainly', 'Superman', 'not', 'crusader', 'good', 'own', 'set', 'ethics', 'undoubtedly', 'burned', 'birth', 'personally', 'ca', ""n't"", 'agree', 'tactics', 'never', 'found', 'rooting', 'system', 'was', 'place', 'was', 'horrid', 'one', 'did', 'need', 'be', 'brought', 'down', 'especially', 'someone', 'who', 'had', 'been', 'brought', 'down', 'system.The', 'acting', 'first', 'rate', 'are', 'special', 'effects.As', 'noted', 'first', 'paragraph', 'stories', 'are', 'made', 'film', 'story', 'invoked', 'passion', 'sort', 'film', 'certainly', 'evoked', 'passion', 'terrifying', 'reminder', 'totalitarian', 'regimes', 'have', 'existed', 'have', 'been', 'created', 'virtually', 'overnight', 'how', 'perilously', 'close', 'are', 'now', 'slipping', 'backward', 'instead', 'forward']",N/A

That's it.And this screenplay was written almost ten years before its release.  The Warchawski brothers created THE MATRIX films first.  And in them all, Hugo Weaving; quite a step up, here, in my opinion, from those interminable, overwrought English pixie movies in elfin-babble starring Elija Wood and everybody else but him.No, I don't need to have read any of the Lloyd/Moore graphic novels, I think.  There are so many of these masterpieces of literary comics around nowadays, and everybody's doing them.  But, a movie is still just a shadowplay.  Nevertheless, it is always an event to see John Hurt in anything: The inquisitive First Officer from ALIEN, or THE ELEPHANT MAN, or the distinguished seducer from LOVE AND DEATH ON LONG ISLAND, or HELLBOY's adoptive earth-father from the movie of the same name, or as the victim/narrator from 1984.  That man's got something hardly any actor has; he can absolutely grip you and convince you of what he's doing within five minutes of any story.  And you absolutely cannot forget him.  Not even remotely attractive, but fascinating.The movie V has (English) political and even historical overtones, based as it is on Guy Fawkes Day -- that's the annual holiday the English celebrate the attempted destruction of Parliament -- but the dotty Baroness Thatcher is gone, nonetheless, though not forgotten, and Britain is now Labor and the flow of cash out of England to Enron in Texas has ceased.  One hopes.  But nobody need be aware of any of that on first watching.  V is very skillfully written, in that regard, so that whatever might slow things down to political mud wrestling is avoided, and the action is allowed to move at a brisk pace.  All the elements of the story; the Dictator and his cronies; the police; the constabulary SWAT goons; the unintended female hostage/victim/accomplice (the sympathetic, winsome Natalie Portman) and her abductor/guru/hero (velvet-voiced Hugo, always in disguise) are in evidence and work as a team to reveal the story as it tightens and coils toward its inevitable end.V is very easy to watch and understand.  Exciting to look at, the story, it seems to me, is a meditation on this proposition:  Cromwell liberated England from its Monarch and its aristocracy, but the Parliament, once it was free to do so sold the people to the nobility which has kept them enslaved ever since.  The pertinent question is, what a nation would England be were the English people free to work for their benefit alone?  And that causes us to wonder what a nation the United States of America would be, were this nation allowed to prosper for the benefit of all its citizens, equally?",5,STOP! GO BACK!

176425,A27CHILBK6HIL2,1419838830,Kaya Savas,"[3, 7]","MOVIE: The story of V, the masked freedom fighter (or terrorist), is a dark vision of the future and how the government basically runs our lives. We have seen a recent lineup of films that take on this 1984 theme of Big Brother and we must overthrow it. If you remember the slightly enjoyable Equilibrium, and the recent Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet then you can see that this has been expressed in film already. However, with the Wachowskis helming the script we finally have a real intellectual look at the subject of a totalitarian government. The film takes place in Britain and is ruled by a dictator who is played by John Hurt (you know him as the guy from Alien who had his chest bursted open). V is the man who was betrayed and left for dead by the government and almost lost his life in a fire. Now he stands against his nation's leader by destroying government buildings and rounding up society to stand with him. He covers up his scarred body with a black caped outfit and a vaudevillian mask. Natalie Portman plays the supporting role who ends up seeing the world has V sees it. The film is very stylish and the dialogue is rich with meaning. I haven't read the graphic novel, so I cannot say if this interpretation is faithful the the comic character. But it's hard to find whose vision is being represented in the film, and that kind of makes the film a little unfocused at times. You have the original source material by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the screenplay by the Wachowski's, and first time director James McTeigue. McTeigue was First Assistant Director on all three Matrix films, so it looks as if he is just being largely influenced by the Wachowski's. It basically feels like there are 5 directors, and not one straight vision. Hugo Weaving seals the movie with his sophisticated voice and really gives the character a reason for his motivation. It's an overall entertaining film with lots of ideas being expressed. The only thing is that these ideas have been expressed many times already in a variety of similar films.ACTING: Hugo Weaving (known as Agent Smith in the Matrix films) plays V, and he does a fantastic job even though we never see his face. He expresses his character's emotion through voice, and his voice is a perfect fit for the character. Natalie Portman basically becomes V's back support, and becomes more attracted to him and his goals throughout the film. She goes through a rebirth and sees the government the way V does, and basically fights alongside him. I have to mention though that her British accent was quite weak. John Hurt does a satisfactory job as the angry dictator. The cast does a fine job, but no standout performances.BOTTOM LINE: How does one man secretly manufacture and ship vaudevillian masks, black capes, and black hats to the entire population of England while the country is under a dicatorship and everything is run by the government? I don't know, but if you can get past some illogical plot holes and a familiar plot; the film itself is entertaining and enjoyable. It's well done, but it has inconsistant direction. There are more pros than cons about the film, and it's worth seeing.",4,"A Decent Film With A Great Intellectucal Script, But It's Unfocused",1143331200,"03 26, 2006",2006,3159,"['MOVIE', 'story', 'V', 'masked', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'terrorist', 'dark', 'vision', 'future', 'how', 'government', 'basically', 'lives', 'have', 'seen', 'recent', 'lineup', 'films', 'take', '1984', 'theme', 'Big', 'Brother', 'must', 'overthrow', 'remember', 'slightly', 'enjoyable', 'Equilibrium', 'recent', 'Aeon', 'Flux', 'Ultraviolet', 'then', 'can', 'see', 'been', 'expressed', 'film', 'already', 'However', 'Wachowskis', 'helming', 'script', 'finally', 'have', 'real', 'intellectual', 'look', 'subject', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'film', 'place', 'Britain', 'ruled', 'dictator', 'who', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'know', 'guy', 'Alien', 'who', 'had', 'chest', 'bursted', 'open', 'V', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'betrayed', 'left', 'dead', 'government', 'almost', 'lost', 'life', 'fire', 'Now', 'nation', 'leader', 'destroying', 'government', 'buildings', 'rounding', 'up', 'society', 'stand', 'up', 'scarred', 'body', 'black', 'caped', 'outfit', 'vaudevillian', 'mask', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'supporting', 'role', 'who', 'up', 'seeing', 'world', 'V', 'sees', 'film', 'very', 'stylish', 'dialogue', 'rich', 'meaning', 'have', ""n't"", 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'can', 'not', 'say', 'interpretation', 'faithful', 'comic', 'character', 'hard', 'find', 'vision', 'being', 'represented', 'film', 'kind', 'film', 'little', 'unfocused', 'times', 'have', 'original', 'source', 'material', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'David', 'Lloyd', 'screenplay', 'Wachowski', 'first', 'time', 'director', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'McTeigue', 'was', 'First', 'Assistant', 'Director', 'three', 'Matrix', 'films', 'just', 'being', 'largely', 'influenced', 'Wachowski', 'basically', 'are', '5', 'directors', 'not', 'one', 'straight', 'vision', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'movie', 'sophisticated', 'voice', 'really', 'character', 'reason', 'motivation', 'overall', 'entertaining', 'film', 'lots', 'ideas', 'being', 'expressed', 'only', 'thing', 'ideas', 'have', 'been', 'expressed', 'many', 'times', 'already', 'variety', 'similar', 'films.ACTING', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'known', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'Matrix', 'films', 'V', 'fantastic', 'job', 'even', 'never', 'see', 'face', 'character', 'emotion', 'voice', 'voice', 'perfect', 'fit', 'character', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'basically', 'V', 'back', 'support', 'more', 'attracted', 'goals', 'film', 'rebirth', 'government', 'way', 'V', 'basically', 'fights', 'have', 'mention', 'British', 'accent', 'was', 'quite', 'weak', 'John', 'Hurt', 'satisfactory', 'job', 'angry', 'dictator', 'cast', 'fine', 'job', 'standout', 'LINE', 'How', 'one', 'man', 'secretly', 'manufacture', 'ship', 'vaudevillian', 'masks', 'black', 'capes', 'black', 'hats', 'entire', 'population', 'England', 'country', 'dicatorship', 'everything', 'run', 'government', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'can', 'get', 'past', 'illogical', 'plot', 'holes', 'familiar', 'plot', 'film', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'well', 'done', 'inconsistant', 'direction', 'are', 'more', 'pros', 'cons', 'film', 'worth', 'seeing']",N/A

At the end of the movie we just sat there in our chairs while the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"" blared out of the 108+ speakers hidden behind the screen, too drained to say anything but eager to agree.Natalie Portman is OK, her disturbing and irrelevant resemblance to Sinead O'Connor made us wonder why they just didn't go whole hog and put O'Connor in the movie.  She's not the world's most interesting actress but she seemed to be giving it her all, so we wound up liking her even at the same time as we were thinking how  tiny she is, like a little elf.  And the torture scenes seemed so unrealistic, like wouldn't a sneeze blow her against the prison cell wall and splat her like a flyswatter?  No way could she withstand the abuse she's dealt out in this movie.  I thought she had it bad in GARDEN STATE being forced into kookiness the whole time but here she has to represent the entire viewership of the movie as she (and by extension, ourselves) are argued and browbeaten into radical politics, possibly anarchy, by a well-written screenplay and a series of haunting, scary images on the screen.Hugo Weaving fares better, even with his painted on china (or is it bulletproof steel) mask and its great painted grin, like a merry-go-round horse grinning in a death rictus.  I thought it strange that he would choose as his theme song ""Cry Me a River,"" but the other song he plays, by Antony and the Johnsons, really hit the note of the sexually ""other.""  When V falls in love with Evey, it really does change his plans as well as his perspective on the ultimate meaning of life and death.  As a love story, V FOR VENDETTA is a little bit similar to MY FAIR LADY.Is there some special pleading in the movie for gay and lesbian civil rights?  I don't see how you can read the subplots of Gordon Dietrich and of Valerie Page any other way.  My hat is off to a mainstream American movie that dares to raise these issues in the current climate of rightwing homophobia.Someone at the theater said the filmmakers had originally cast James Purefoy, whom I remember as the faun in NARNIA, to play V, then after a few scenes realized he wasn't working out, similarly to the way Viggo Mortensen wound up replacing Stuart Townsend as Aragorn in THE LORD OF THE RINGS.  I watched the movie and I concur with the filmmaker's decision.  I just can't imagine V played by anyone else but Weaving.  But this isn't really an actor's movie, is it?  (Although Stephen Rea does some magnificently simple yet enthralling work as Chief Inspector Finch, the policeman who gradually goes over to the ""dark side."")

176428,A2RKI7RPP5CJMG,1419838830,"K. Fontenot ""Prairie Cajun Regenerated!""","[8, 33]","""V for Vendetta"" is one of the most boring revolutionary epics I've ever watched.  With a screenplay and production by the Wachowski Brothers, I'd at least expect plenty of explosions and some neat special effects because, let's be honest, folks, the only reason that the first ""Matrix"" flick did very well was because of the whole slo-mo bullet biz.  After the initial shock, the sequels of that particular flick were nothing more than fluff.  However, it seems that the Wachowski boys were hoping that adapting a graphic novel (i.e. a really big comic book for adults too ashamed to admit they still read comics) with a Shakespeare-spouting, Fawkes mask-wearing, anti-hero/terrorist wannabe would make for a cool picture.  It almost did, but the fact is that Hugo Weaving's portrayal of ""V"" is so weighed down by theatrics that the viewer is more likened to take a nap than take up arms.  Natalie Portman delivers her standard wooden performance that won our hearts in the Star Wars prequels.  Why didn't they just go with an actual British woman to play her role?  Portman's only great performance was in ""The Professional"" with Jean Reno, and that was quite a few years ago.The story centers around a supposed terrorist who goes by the name ""V.""  He's mad at the government for making him into a hideous monster and has decided to overthrow said government by blowing up numerous British monuments and historically important buildings.  The only catch is that this ""terrorist"" politely allows all of the citizens inside the buildings to escape before he does his damage.  Doesn't quite sound like a terrorist to me.  Sounds more like a pest.The government head, gamely played by John Hurt, is supposedly meant to represent the current U.S. government.  However, the only thing that ran through my mind when we see Hurt's character screaming and ranting at his top officers was the same screaming and ranting done by Hilary Clinton, John Kerry, and perennial loser, Al Gore.  Hurt screams threats at everyone hoping to force them into submission.  He wants things his way and doesn't care what anyone else thinks.  He's a big baby, a dictator, just like many of today's liberal leaders attempt to be under the guise of ""tolerance.""  I hate to get political with this review, but a movie such as this begs to moved into that arena.The special effects are done fairly well, and the Wachowskis even pull the old bullet-time effect out of their dwindling bag of tricks except this time they use V's knives instead of bullets.I'll agree with other reviewers that this film does make you think.  A totalitarian government is an evil thing, but some sort of order is needed.  Without it, you have anarchy, and anarchy has never worked.  Why?  Because someone ultimately wants to be the leader.  To be a revolutionary with a clear idea of how things should be and the best way to engage those ideals is one thing, but to simply be a rebel without a reason is absurd.  This is a film about revenge, not revolution.If you loved the ""Matrix"" trilogy, you'll probably be disappointed by this flick.  The action is spread throughout a bogged down monologue by V and the end result attempts to be artistic, but falters in the end.Recommended as a rental only.",2,You Say You Want A Revolution??,1155340800,"08 12, 2006",2006,3248,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'one', 'most', 'boring', 'revolutionary', 'epics', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'watched', 'screenplay', 'production', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', ""'d"", 'least', 'expect', 'plenty', 'explosions', 'neat', 'special', 'effects', 'let', 'be', 'honest', 'folks', 'only', 'reason', 'first', 'Matrix', 'flick', 'did', 'very', 'well', 'was', 'whole', 'slo-mo', 'bullet', 'biz', 'initial', 'shock', 'sequels', 'particular', 'flick', 'were', 'nothing', 'more', 'fluff', 'However', 'Wachowski', 'boys', 'were', 'hoping', 'adapting', 'graphic', 'novel', 'i.e', 'really', 'big', 'comic', 'book', 'adults', 'too', 'ashamed', 'admit', 'still', 'read', 'comics', 'Shakespeare-spouting', 'Fawkes', 'mask-wearing', 'anti-hero/terrorist', 'wannabe', 'would', 'make', 'cool', 'picture', 'almost', 'did', 'fact', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'portrayal', 'V', 'so', 'weighed', 'down', 'theatrics', 'viewer', 'more', 'likened', 'take', 'nap', 'take', 'up', 'arms', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'standard', 'wooden', 'performance', 'won', 'hearts', 'Star', 'Wars', 'prequels', 'Why', 'did', ""n't"", 'just', 'go', 'actual', 'British', 'woman', 'play', 'role', 'Portman', 'only', 'great', 'performance', 'was', 'Professional', 'Jean', 'Reno', 'was', 'quite', 'few', 'years', 'ago.The', 'story', 'centers', 'supposed', 'terrorist', 'who', 'name', 'V.', 'mad', 'government', 'making', 'hideous', 'monster', 'decided', 'overthrow', 'said', 'government', 'blowing', 'up', 'numerous', 'British', 'monuments', 'historically', 'important', 'buildings', 'only', 'catch', 'terrorist', 'politely', 'citizens', 'buildings', 'escape', 'damage', ""n't"", 'quite', 'sound', 'terrorist', 'more', 'pest.The', 'government', 'head', 'gamely', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'supposedly', 'meant', 'represent', 'current', 'U.S.', 'government', 'However', 'only', 'thing', 'ran', 'mind', 'when', 'see', 'Hurt', 'character', 'screaming', 'ranting', 'top', 'officers', 'was', 'same', 'screaming', 'ranting', 'done', 'Hilary', 'Clinton', 'John', 'Kerry', 'perennial', 'loser', 'Al', 'Gore', 'Hurt', 'screams', 'threats', 'everyone', 'hoping', 'force', 'submission', 'things', 'way', ""n't"", 'care', 'what', 'anyone', 'else', 'thinks', 'big', 'baby', 'dictator', 'just', 'many', 'today', 'liberal', 'leaders', 'attempt', 'be', 'guise', 'tolerance', 'hate', 'get', 'political', 'review', 'movie', 'such', 'begs', 'moved', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'Wachowskis', 'even', 'old', 'bullet-time', 'effect', 'dwindling', 'bag', 'tricks', 'time', 'use', 'V', 'knives', 'instead', 'bullets.I', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'film', 'make', 'think', 'totalitarian', 'government', 'evil', 'thing', 'sort', 'order', 'needed', 'have', 'anarchy', 'anarchy', 'never', 'worked', 'Why', 'someone', 'ultimately', 'be', 'leader', 'be', 'revolutionary', 'clear', 'idea', 'how', 'things', 'should', 'be', 'best', 'way', 'engage', 'ideals', 'one', 'thing', 'simply', 'be', 'rebel', 'reason', 'absurd', 'film', 'revenge', 'not', 'revolution.If', 'loved', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', ""'ll"", 'probably', 'be', 'disappointed', 'flick', 'action', 'spread', 'bogged', 'monologue', 'V', 'end', 'result', 'attempts', 'be', 'artistic', 'falters', 'end.Recommended', 'rental', 'only']",N/A

Whether it's a penchant for anti-establishment-ism or the implicit siren's call of the stunningly beautiful Miss Portman, I can't pass this up when it airs on HBO (At least I don't have 14 copies of Catcher in the Rye...yet). Beyond her looks, though, I was thoroughly taken by her acting performance. It's easy to dismiss someone who looks this good, and trying to be as objective as possible, I was pleasantly surprised by her performance and range of emotions. There's more to this book than its lovely cover.To simplify things, V is a more aesthetically pleasing take on the message in Fight Club, but with some Matrix flair in the special effects department. I would normally give this a 4 star rating, but since the last good movie out (IMO) was The Sixth Sense, I gave it a bonus star because I'm starved for something substantive.The one annoying thing for me about the production is the volume delta, forcing me to boost same for certain portions of the dialog, only to have to haul it back down during the raucous volumes of the action sequences.

176439,A1LJZWBVCB44RO,1419838830,"K. Sullivan ""No accounting for taste...""","[2, 3]","Having not read the graphic novel on which this movie is based, I cannot (and would not) debate the faithfulness of the adaptation or its relative worth.  I also cannot divine what the Wachowski brothers' intent or motivations might have been, especially regarding the current political climate.  I can only relate what I witnessed and experienced from the film alone as an isolated piece of art, and it was good... profoundly so.The film does not dabble with subtleties or nuances.  The regime in charge of Britain is clearly oppressive.  However they came to power and whatever their motivations (and the film ultimately reveals the back story), it is clear that they rejoice in their complete authority and enthusiastically abuse it.  The field agents or Fingermen violate the citizenry; the televised face of the nation self-righteously revels in the judgment heaped upon other nations spewing smug vitriol; the religious leaders fulfill their carnal desires; the communications ministry controls all programming twisting the news to its own ends while eavesdropping on the general population; the Chancellor clearly rules through fear and with an iron fist.  Dissidents are quickly and quietly disposed of through violent means.  Free thought does not exist.  This is an archetypal oppressive evil regime.V is the faceless archetypal hero.  Happily he remains faceless for the duration of the movie.  His mask is all we see.  The lifeless mask allows for his thoughts and ideas to be the focus rather than his individuality.  His appeal is not so much for how he handles a fight and a blade, though impressive; his true weapon is speech.  Eloquent and literate, he expresses ideas that cut straight to the heart (the people should not fear their government, but the government should fear its people).  Suspend belief for a period and watch as he shakes a sleeping nation.  He chastises the citizens as the true culprits that have allowed the current state of affairs.  Then he provides inspiration and a means  to do something about it.  We see the cowardly and zombie-like nation slowly awaken and climactically throw off its oppressor.This is not a ""how-to"" tool for overthrowing a dictatorship.  Nor is it in my opinion a scathing indictment of any administration or specific political landscape in the first decade of the 21st century (though it will make you think about some things).  Its power is in the universality of the tale.  It resonates because it does not have to be political at all.  It is about people and oppression and anyone finally standing up to throw off tyranny in any of its forms by whatever means.  Certainly violence works well for a movie and to dramatically represent the point.  But do not lock the greater meaning and power of the message into its form.  Speaking of its universality, I was very much reminded of the musical ""Les Miserables"" (precursor to the French Revolution).  It is a rousing tale where one sacrifices self-interest for the greater good.The cinematography is phenomenal with its stark colorization; it is a visually stunning film.  The action is entertaining.  A more rousing tune than the ""1812 Overture"" cannot be found.  The film slows slightly while providing some back story, but it is necessary to fully inform the narrative.  From start to finish, it is just a remarkable achievement.",5,Thus always to tyrants and oppression - fantastic movie,1223078400,"10 4, 2008",2008,3351,"['Having', 'not', 'read', 'graphic', 'novel', 'movie', 'based', 'can', 'not', 'would', 'not', 'debate', 'faithfulness', 'adaptation', 'relative', 'worth', 'also', 'can', 'not', 'divine', 'what', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'intent', 'motivations', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'especially', 'regarding', 'current', 'political', 'climate', 'can', 'only', 'relate', 'what', 'witnessed', 'experienced', 'film', 'alone', 'isolated', 'piece', 'art', 'was', 'good', 'profoundly', 'so.The', 'film', 'not', 'dabble', 'subtleties', 'nuances', 'regime', 'charge', 'Britain', 'clearly', 'oppressive', 'However', 'came', 'power', 'motivations', 'film', 'ultimately', 'back', 'story', 'clear', 'rejoice', 'complete', 'authority', 'enthusiastically', 'abuse', 'field', 'agents', 'Fingermen', 'violate', 'citizenry', 'televised', 'face', 'nation', 'self-righteously', 'revels', 'judgment', 'heaped', 'other', 'nations', 'spewing', 'smug', 'vitriol', 'religious', 'leaders', 'fulfill', 'carnal', 'desires', 'communications', 'ministry', 'programming', 'twisting', 'news', 'own', 'ends', 'eavesdropping', 'general', 'population', 'Chancellor', 'clearly', 'rules', 'fear', 'iron', 'fist', 'Dissidents', 'are', 'quickly', 'quietly', 'disposed', 'violent', 'means', 'Free', 'thought', 'not', 'exist', 'archetypal', 'oppressive', 'evil', 'regime.V', 'faceless', 'archetypal', 'hero', 'Happily', 'faceless', 'duration', 'movie', 'mask', 'see', 'lifeless', 'mask', 'thoughts', 'ideas', 'be', 'focus', 'rather', 'individuality', 'appeal', 'not', 'so', 'much', 'how', 'fight', 'blade', 'impressive', 'true', 'weapon', 'speech', 'Eloquent', 'literate', 'ideas', 'cut', 'straight', 'heart', 'people', 'should', 'not', 'fear', 'government', 'government', 'should', 'fear', 'people', 'Suspend', 'belief', 'period', 'watch', 'sleeping', 'nation', 'citizens', 'true', 'culprits', 'have', 'allowed', 'current', 'state', 'affairs', 'Then', 'inspiration', 'means', 'do', 'something', 'see', 'cowardly', 'zombie-like', 'nation', 'slowly', 'awaken', 'climactically', 'throw', 'off', 'oppressor.This', 'not', 'how-to', 'tool', 'overthrowing', 'dictatorship', 'opinion', 'scathing', 'indictment', 'administration', 'specific', 'political', 'landscape', 'first', 'decade', '21st', 'century', 'will', 'make', 'think', 'things', 'power', 'universality', 'tale', 'not', 'have', 'be', 'political', 'people', 'oppression', 'anyone', 'finally', 'standing', 'up', 'throw', 'off', 'tyranny', 'forms', 'means', 'Certainly', 'violence', 'works', 'well', 'movie', 'dramatically', 'represent', 'point', 'do', 'not', 'lock', 'greater', 'meaning', 'power', 'message', 'form', 'Speaking', 'universality', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'reminded', 'musical', 'Les', 'Miserables', 'precursor', 'French', 'Revolution', 'rousing', 'tale', 'where', 'one', 'self-interest', 'greater', 'good.The', 'cinematography', 'phenomenal', 'stark', 'colorization', 'visually', 'stunning', 'film', 'action', 'entertaining', 'more', 'rousing', 'tune', '1812', 'Overture', 'can', 'not', 'be', 'found', 'film', 'slightly', 'providing', 'back', 'story', 'necessary', 'fully', 'inform', 'narrative', 'start', 'finish', 'just', 'remarkable', 'achievement']",N/A
176440,A2ICI500LRO01K,1419838830,Kyle Wells,"[4, 5]","""V for Vendetta"" is by no means a great movie, and I am not totally convinced it is even a particularly good one, but it has more spirit and bravado than anything I have seen in some time. The film comes across as current, decidedly a product of its time, and perhaps even relevant, which is something rarely seen anymore in contemporary popular cinema. We live in a very political world right now, a world of wars, aggressive internationalism, and often bitter partisanship; in other words, a climate that should give rise to much fiery and impassioned art. This has unfortunately not been the case. It is a little discouraging to see that it has taken a UK-Germany co-production to finally make a film worth arguing about, a film that isn't afraid to use the word `terrorist,' a film often shocking in its blunt political assertions, but with this misgiving aside, it must still be appreciated that such a film has been made at all.I say that ""V for Vendetta"" is not a great film because on a level of pure entertainment is falls short of what it could have accomplished. It's just odd enough to be interesting and just energetic enough to be exciting, but as with any film fueled by ambition, some of what it attempts falls short. The first half of the film was quite riveting, but it begins to lose a little steam towards the final act, as the story gets stretched a little thin and the momentum of the piece begins to falter. The love scenes, albeit brief and for the most part unobtrusive, were nevertheless unnecessary and didn't quite work for me, nor did the scenes concerning Creedy delivering the Chancellor, which were confusing at best. The acting throughout the movie was good but nothing more. Natalie Portman was more than adequate and certainly looked the part, but her performance did not strike me as anything special. Neither did Hugo Weaving's as V, but then again it can be hard to judge an actor who is masked for the entire film (crafty Greeks!). The effects were generally vibrant and enjoyable, except for the CGI enveloped fight between V and a dozen or so policemen which was over-the-top in a way that seemed beneath the rest of the film. Most of these complaints can be credited to the film being overlong, which somewhat hurt its momentum, and to the filmmaker's attempts to do too much with one film...Which is also partly what saved the film. ""V for Vendetta"" is a rarity these days because it is a film that has something to say and seems rather urgent to say it. This causes problems, sure, but it also injects the film with enough energy to make it often invigorating and always interesting. This is an unabashedly political film and in a way that confronts the conventional views and positions that our current pop culture insists on feeding us. The film is undoubtedly anti-Bush and anti-Western colonialism, which is not uncommon, but with a degree of passion and fevered insistence seldom seen any more. Its cry of protest is reminiscent of the anti-totalitarian rallies of Orwell or Huxley, and words such as `revolution' and `fascism' are used without hesitation. I do not necessarily believe that the movie is anything more than just that, a movie, nor do I agree with everything it could be potentially saying, but I do believe that art as bold as this, and as politically charged and confrontational, is the sure sign of a healthy culture. If there were more films that tried to say half as much as ""V for Vendetta"" our weekly trips to the theatre or video store would be a far less dull affair.I am as impressed by the fact that this film got such wide distribution in the States as I am disheartened by my insistence that it would have never been made had the White House replaced the British Parliament as the primary symbol of the film. America is plainly mentioned as the cause of the war that brought the destruction of our present society, but due to its British setting, matched with its graphic novel appearance, the film is distant enough that those who should take the most away from it will probably take nothing. Despite this the film is still as incendiary as anything you will see for some time, I imagine, and should have been far more controversial and debated than it was. It is not great, but any film which in our present situation associates terrorism, the Koran, and domestic anarchy with its heroes, for better or for worse, is certainly a film worth seeing.",4,"A Lively, Politically Aggressive Movie",1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,4426,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'great', 'movie', 'am', 'not', 'totally', 'convinced', 'even', 'particularly', 'good', 'one', 'more', 'spirit', 'bravado', 'anything', 'have', 'seen', 'time', 'film', 'current', 'decidedly', 'product', 'time', 'perhaps', 'even', 'relevant', 'something', 'rarely', 'seen', 'anymore', 'contemporary', 'popular', 'cinema', 'live', 'very', 'political', 'world', 'right', 'now', 'world', 'wars', 'aggressive', 'internationalism', 'often', 'bitter', 'partisanship', 'other', 'words', 'climate', 'should', 'give', 'rise', 'much', 'fiery', 'impassioned', 'art', 'unfortunately', 'not', 'been', 'case', 'little', 'discouraging', 'see', 'taken', 'UK-Germany', 'co-production', 'finally', 'make', 'film', 'arguing', 'about', 'film', ""n't"", 'afraid', 'use', 'word', 'terrorist', 'film', 'often', 'shocking', 'blunt', 'political', 'assertions', 'misgiving', 'aside', 'must', 'still', 'be', 'appreciated', 'film', 'been', 'made', 'all.I', 'say', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'level', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'falls', 'short', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'accomplished', 'just', 'odd', 'enough', 'be', 'interesting', 'just', 'energetic', 'enough', 'be', 'exciting', 'film', 'fueled', 'ambition', 'what', 'short', 'first', 'half', 'film', 'was', 'quite', 'riveting', 'lose', 'little', 'steam', 'final', 'act', 'story', 'stretched', 'little', 'thin', 'momentum', 'piece', 'falter', 'love', 'scenes', 'brief', 'most', 'part', 'unobtrusive', 'were', 'nevertheless', 'unnecessary', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'work', 'did', 'scenes', 'concerning', 'Creedy', 'delivering', 'Chancellor', 'were', 'confusing', 'best', 'acting', 'movie', 'was', 'good', 'nothing', 'more', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'was', 'more', 'adequate', 'certainly', 'looked', 'part', 'performance', 'did', 'not', 'strike', 'anything', 'special', 'did', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'V', 'then', 'again', 'can', 'be', 'hard', 'judge', 'actor', 'who', 'masked', 'entire', 'film', 'crafty', 'Greeks', 'effects', 'were', 'generally', 'vibrant', 'enjoyable', 'CGI', 'enveloped', 'fight', 'V', 'dozen', 'so', 'policemen', 'was', 'over-the-top', 'way', 'seemed', 'rest', 'film', 'Most', 'complaints', 'can', 'be', 'credited', 'film', 'being', 'somewhat', 'hurt', 'momentum', 'filmmaker', 'attempts', 'do', 'too', 'much', 'one', 'film', 'Which', 'also', 'partly', 'what', 'saved', 'film', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'rarity', 'days', 'film', 'something', 'say', 'rather', 'urgent', 'say', 'problems', 'sure', 'also', 'film', 'enough', 'energy', 'make', 'often', 'invigorating', 'always', 'interesting', 'unabashedly', 'political', 'film', 'way', 'conventional', 'views', 'positions', 'current', 'pop', 'culture', 'feeding', 'film', 'undoubtedly', 'anti-Bush', 'anti-Western', 'colonialism', 'not', 'uncommon', 'degree', 'passion', 'fevered', 'insistence', 'seldom', 'seen', 'more', 'cry', 'protest', 'reminiscent', 'anti-totalitarian', 'rallies', 'Orwell', 'Huxley', 'words', 'such', 'revolution', 'fascism', 'are', 'used', 'hesitation', 'do', 'not', 'necessarily', 'believe', 'movie', 'anything', 'more', 'just', 'movie', 'do', 'agree', 'everything', 'could', 'be', 'potentially', 'saying', 'do', 'believe', 'art', 'as', 'bold', 'politically', 'charged', 'confrontational', 'sure', 'sign', 'healthy', 'culture', 'were', 'more', 'films', 'tried', 'say', 'half', 'as', 'much', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'weekly', 'trips', 'theatre', 'video', 'store', 'would', 'be', 'far', 'less', 'dull', 'affair.I', 'am', 'impressed', 'fact', 'film', 'got', 'such', 'wide', 'distribution', 'States', 'am', 'disheartened', 'insistence', 'would', 'have', 'never', 'been', 'made', 'had', 'White', 'House', 'replaced', 'British', 'Parliament', 'primary', 'symbol', 'film', 'America', 'plainly', 'mentioned', 'cause', 'war', 'brought', 'destruction', 'present', 'society', 'due', 'British', 'setting', 'matched', 'graphic', 'novel', 'appearance', 'film', 'distant', 'enough', 'who', 'should', 'take', 'most', 'away', 'will', 'probably', 'take', 'nothing', 'film', 'still', 'as', 'incendiary', 'anything', 'will', 'see', 'time', 'imagine', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'far', 'more', 'controversial', 'debated', 'was', 'not', 'great', 'film', 'present', 'situation', 'terrorism', 'Koran', 'domestic', 'anarchy', 'heroes', 'better', 'worse', 'certainly', 'film', 'seeing']",N/A

Eventually a victim of the government (in this case, V) performs daring acts to get the people to think about standing up to what should be ""their"" government.A little too much propaganda-ish at the end, though I did like who the V character was shown to be both hero and villan in the eyes of Evey, the heroine.

It reminded me most of the Ridley Scott ad for Nike that ran one time, during the 1984 Super Bowl, where a young athlete flung a hammer through a television screen featuring Big Brother.While hardly a masterpiece, ""V for Vendetta"" is certainly better and more entertaining than ""The Island"", the last modern film I saw that addressed mass hysteria, mass mind control, and oppression.The hero is a masked character in a round hat and cape named V, a victim of a government biochemical experiment gone bad, who is out for revenge against those that did him wrong in totalitarian England. He manages to do things no one could realistically do -- control all television in England for his message, fight off a dozen armed guards at a time, etc. -- but still makes his point in a world where apparently everyone watched HDTV.Aside from getting even with the 10 people on his list, V sets out to lead a counterrevolution to regain democracy, or so he says; he appears in most scenes to be more despotic than democratic. The film revolves around his exploits, his friendship with a like-minded young woman, and the government's inability to corral him.The characterizations in this film are all one-dimensional, almost cartoonish, but that does not detract from the involvement or enjoyment aspects of the fantasy. It's kind of like Woddy Allen's ""Bananas"" played straight, without the laughs.

176445,ASSCA9IS0GWF5,1419838830,Laszlo Matyas,"[2, 7]","V For Vendetta is the rarest of things: A work of art that manages to be both commercially viable and uncompromisingly subversive. It's an arrestingly stylish, devastatingly smart movie whose every scene demands attention and contemplation. Without being preachy or condescending, it demands that its viewers think. Without resorting to cliche or cheap sentiment, it packs a hell of an emotional wallop. Without resorting to cardboard-cutout characterization or vague moralizing (and this is the really cool part), it sends an impossible-to-ignore message about right, wrong, oppression, revolution, responsibility, and the role of the individual.  And at the same time, it's incredibly fun to watch.The plot is a bit complex (and besides, watching the story unfold is half the fun. Well, more like a third of the fun. But I digress...), but here's what you should know: Our story takes place in an unpleasant future. England has fallen under the power of a very oppressive, very totalitarian regime, which has come to power by riding a wave of fear triggered by a surge in terrorist attacks. Free expression and democracy are things of the past, all information is controlled by the government, anyone who complains winds up disappearing, and God help you if you're a Muslim. What sets this brave new world apart from (and ahead of) other, lesser cinematic dystopias is its incredible atmosphere. This England is a creeping sort of nightmare, a strange and hostile place that evokes dread and paranoia with a throbbing undercurrent of tension. As anyone who's ever been across the pond (for those of you joining us from Europe, Asia, Africa, or Australia, ""on your side of the pond"") can probably tell you, the setting of V For Vendetta is an uncannily dark mirror image of the Isle that we all know and love. It's atmospheric, hypnotic, and undeniably powerful. This setting is populated by an equally engaging cast of heroes and villains- from the charismatic and utterly ruthless High Chancellor Adam Sutler to the oddly sympathetic government inspector Eric Finch to the film's twin protagonists, Evey Hammond and V, just about everybody in this film is a wonderfully drawn, finely crafted example of characterization at its sharpest. It's a stage full of Hamlets  and Mia Wallaces, without a single Jar Jar Binks to ruin the flow.The story itself, which concerns V's yearlong crusade against the tyranny that has fallen on hi nation, is simply brilliant. V himself is a stunningly drawn character, an incredibly complex man whose cool charisma and literate style belie a troubled, vulnerable sort of humanity. It's not always easy to agree with his methods- he resorts to acts of violence that border on anarchic terrorism- but therein lies the brilliance of the movie: V For Vendetta doesn't aim to make us blindly sympathize with its central character. Rather, it demands that we think, forces us to consider our own views on revolution, freedom, revenge, and violence. Is it right to defy a government if we see its actions as unjust? Can one man's actions speak for the ideas of many? Is it ever right to kill another human being? The questions may be as old as time, but this movie casts them in a startlingly new light.And it's entertaining, too: The plot is genuinely suspenseful and engaging, full of twists, and revelations. The action scenes are fantastically choreographed, the dialog is razor-sharp, the visuals are unforgettable, and the climax is simply gorgeous.

176447,A2NJO6YE954DBH,1419838830,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 19]","Overall, I was definitely disappointed by ""V for Vendetta,"" primarily because I was anticipating a really great adaptation of the work by writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd.  I was also looking forward to a movie that I would be able to use in my Introduction to Popular Culture class when it comes out on DVD because I thought it would be a nice example of how cinema functions rhetorically.  The idea that a masked figure who blows up public buildings could be a revolutionary hero rather than a murdering terrorist is a radical notion post 9/11.  But this film lacks the subtlety of the original graphic novel and makes a strategic error in foisting a conclusion to this dark tale.  The results are compelling, but not the provocative story I was hoping to see.After recapping the story of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot for ignorant colonials, we cut to the future a couple of decades down the road where Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), is out after curfew in London.  She is about to be raped and probably killed by ""fingermen"" of the security forces when she is rescued by V, dressed in black and a Guy Fawkes mask.  He takes her to the roof top where he conducts a symphony that end with the Old Bailey blowing up.  They meet again when V takes over the single television channel to broadcast a promise that one year hence he will blow up the Parliament building (on Guy Fawkes day, of course) and asks that everyone in England who supports his cause to take to the streets that night to support his actions.  When Evey acts to protect V from the police, he takes her under his wing, and begins to educate her on his method and his madness. Meanwhile, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) is put on the case but immediately hamstrung by the government from being able to investigate the clues that would lead to the identity of the terrorist.The screenplay by the Wachowski Brothers turns Moore's attack on the conservative inclinations of the government of Margaret Thatcher into a more overt representation of a fascist government.  The insignia of this brave new world is a twisted version of the cross, and the fact that the person in charge is a chancellor recalls Hitler, as does the way the chancellor dresses.  Casting John Hurt, who played Winston Smith in the 1984 of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" as Adam Sutler, the fearless leader in this film only heightens the Orwellian analogy.  Moore and Lloyd had the evil men of the government look like ordinary bureaucrats, but this film stacks the deck so that the allusions to Hitler and ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" are so obvious that of course our sympathies are with the terrorist blowing up the buildings (besides, they are not our buildings, they are English buildings; but more on that later).In the movie V speaks of the power of ideas and the importance of using words to persuade rather than coerce, but what really matters is blowing up buildings.  However, in the graphic novel the point was to blow up symbols.  The shift from having Big Ben be the first thing that V blows up in the book, to the total destruction of Parliament being V's ultimate goal, is rather significant.  V's final target in the book was 10 Downing Street and the final explosion is seen from the distance because the explosion is not the point.  It is the awakening political consciousness of Evey that is the soul of this film.My biggest complaint is that the film provides, in relative terms, a happy ending.  No political diatribe worth its salt is going to warn the masses of the evil inherent in the system and then provide an ending that reassures the audience that everything is going to be all right.  The graphic novel ends with a victory, but clearly the war will continue, for at least another generation.  The movie seeks to reassure us with a Rolling Stones song (and does not even bother to play the entire song).  Moore and Lloyd wanted to enlist us, following in the footsteps of Evey as she follows V, but the makers of this film would be happy if we pre-order the DVD after seeing the film.For most viewers it will be the way the films resonates against current events that will be the primary point of controversy.  Relatively few will have read the graphic novel, but far more people remember September 11th in the U.S. than the 5th of November in the U.K.  The idea of purging an English-speaking nation of Muslims, immigrants and homosexuals may or may not seem like something that can happen here.  Blowing up apparently empty buildings in the middle of the night and reserving the blood letting for situations where V gets up close and personal with the bad guys can certainly make this terrorist seem different and, dare we say, acceptable.  In the end we are so clearly distanced from this story that it does not ask us to make any hard choices.I would have preferred to see ""V for Vendetta"" as a television mini-series, not only because I think an episodic approach is better suited to telling the story, but also because it is a much more intimate tale that what we see on the big screen where they go out of their way to crank up the volume on the explosions.  Beyond that, the frozen face that is V's mask becomes a disadvantage both for Weaving and director James McTeigue.  There is only so much you can do with lighting and head tilts, and the first-time director relies too often on close-ups (no wonder James Purefoy bailed on the role).  ""Sin City"" set a standard for adapting a graphic novel to the screen that will probably never be approached by any one else, but I was hoping this one would be a lot closer to the mark.",4,The

Therefore, coming from someone that did not ""know"" of V prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!V for Vendetta brings to the screen the not-so-impossible scenario that in the future England (or any western country for that matter) has become a dictatorship.  Subsequently, a man idolizing a 1605 failed attempt by Guy Fawkes to blow up the English parliament takes it upon himself to start a revolution in order to bring down the regime.  What the revolutionary does not anticipate is to find love in the midst of it all...  It's a bit like the X-Files meets ""1984"" with a bit of Matrix, and all that in a Marvel Comics universe.On the positive side:Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!Moreover, the special effects are pretty good.On the negative side:The film is way too political and too radical for the comics genre.In addition, as in the case of the Michael Moore films, there are good and valid points, but the approach used is so radical and extreme that to a certain extent it backfires and may have the opposite effects.Ridiculing law and order by portraying frequent curfews and constantly stating that they ""are for your protection,"" may encourage lawlessness and anarchy.  Furthermore, the film comes to the defence of certain groups and minorities that mainstream people and common folk do not feel close or akin to, thus scaring them away from pressing matters such as who controls the media (which is something that is presented well in the film).In a nutshell, V for Vendetta may not be a terrible movie, but it's also not what they've made it out to be.",3,"""The Gunpowder Plot"" all over again...",1145577600,"04 21, 2006",2006,2093,"['have', 'say', 'am', 'not', 'familiar', 'comics', 'had', 'had', 'other', 'contact', 'characters', 'apart', 'movie', 'can', 'not', 'make', 'comparisons', 'other', 'sources', 'can', 'take', 'part', 'discussing', 'technicalities', 'specifics', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'Therefore', 'coming', 'someone', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'V', 'prior', 'film', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'rather', 'disappointed', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'screen', 'not-so-impossible', 'scenario', 'future', 'England', 'western', 'country', 'matter', 'become', 'dictatorship', 'Subsequently', 'man', 'idolizing', '1605', 'failed', 'attempt', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'blow', 'up', 'English', 'parliament', 'start', 'revolution', 'order', 'bring', 'down', 'regime', 'What', 'revolutionary', 'not', 'anticipate', 'find', 'love', 'midst', 'bit', 'X-Files', 'meets', '1984', 'bit', 'Matrix', 'Marvel', 'Comics', 'universe.On', 'positive', 'side', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'John', 'Hurt', 'rest', 'cast', 'have', 'truly', 'outdone', 'performances', 'are', 'outstanding', 'say', 'least', 'actors', 'exceptions', 'give', '100', '%', 'really', 'Moreover', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'pretty', 'good.On', 'negative', 'side', 'film', 'way', 'too', 'political', 'too', 'radical', 'comics', 'genre.In', 'addition', 'case', 'Michael', 'Moore', 'films', 'are', 'good', 'valid', 'points', 'approach', 'used', 'so', 'radical', 'extreme', 'certain', 'extent', 'may', 'have', 'opposite', 'effects.Ridiculing', 'law', 'order', 'portraying', 'frequent', 'curfews', 'constantly', 'stating', 'are', 'protection', 'may', 'encourage', 'lawlessness', 'anarchy', 'Furthermore', 'film', 'defence', 'certain', 'groups', 'minorities', 'mainstream', 'people', 'common', 'folk', 'do', 'not', 'feel', 'close', 'akin', 'thus', 'scaring', 'away', 'pressing', 'matters', 'such', 'who', 'media', 'something', 'presented', 'well', 'film', 'nutshell', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'terrible', 'movie', 'also', 'not', 'what', ""'ve"", 'made', 'be']",N/A

It was written in the 1980's and the movie likely had extremely little to do with the graphic novel it was based upon.The Britain of the movie is under the control of a Christian theocracy...never mind that modern-day Britain is hardly a strongly religious nation.  Far from a crumbling society, things for the most part look nice and new and shiny.  Furthermore, the hero V, for having been badly burned in a fire, is able to speak clearly and very agile and quick for someone who had suffered such physical damage.  Besides that, even though everyone and everything is supposed to be closely watched, V is able to gather up and maintain a huge secret room full of antiques, and also is able to send dozens of Guy Fawkes masks through the postal system.Other ridiculous parts also creep into the movie.  The society is strongly anti-homosexual (the product of evil Christianity presumably), and one homosexual man admires the beauty of the verses of the Koran.  Duh, that's like a Jew enjoying ""Mein Kampf"".Worst is the ending.  The people get their Guy Fawkes masks and put them on and walk into the streets, walk up to armed guards...and suddenly walk right through them unmolested.  Then a train full of explosives blows up the buildings of Parliament and Big Ben...and that's it.  What happens next?  Anarchy?  Democracy?

176458,A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK,1419838830,"Lonnie E. Holder ""The Review's the Thing""","[3, 6]","Current special effects and our ability to think permits us virtually unlimited possibilities for movies.  In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.  Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created ""V for Vendetta"" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film.Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has used a series of wars to create a fascist government in England.  There is an inside joke in this choice of actors.  John Hurt previously played Winston Smith in the movie ""1984,"" and he essentially is Big Brother in this movie.  The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.  Guy Fawkes failed in an attempt to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  The character V uses a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face from the very beginning of the movie.  It takes little imagination to realize that V has some fireworks of his own planned.  Later we learn that V is mostly likely horribly disfigured and the mask may be to save us from seeing V as he really is.Much of what we learn about V comes from his interaction with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who V rescued from a couple of policemen that were about to rape Evey.  Unfortunately, Evey's life takes a nasty turn when she helps V.  Evey's only choice is to stay with V.Other than the introduction and the distraction provided by Evey, who we need so that the story of V can unfold, the remainder of the movie focuses on V and his escapades.  What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.  We see little of Sutler except as an image on monitors until the very end of the movie.  The monitor is Sutler's mask.  We never see V's face, and V never directly confronts Sutler until the end of the movie.  Even at the end, the confrontation is indirect.  I dare not say more without spoiling the plot further.The result of the interesting progression of this movie is that of a chess game where we see the result of the moves, but the players are rarely, if ever, present.The selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.  Hurt is absolutely sinister and nearly insane as he feels control slipping away.  Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.Weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.  Weaving brings sadness to his role that is sensed at first in his voice.  V will do what he has to do, but it does not bring him pleasure.  He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.  V's actions were set in motion by events that happened to him, and we accept those actions as V has accepted them.  V acts like the steps he is taking are equivalent to taking out the garbage or raking the yard.  He must do what he is doing, regardless of the consequences.  His actions are the only purpose he has in his life.One aspect of this film has generated controversy.  Is it acceptable for someone to violently overthrow a government?  We would say no.  However, in this movie the government is no longer democratic.  Sutler is an absolute dictator.  There is no possibility for the government to be representative.  While terrorism, which is what V does, is abhorrent, a fascist government that will not permit a change in government is also abhorrent.  If there was another way to resolve the problems facing England in this movie, I am unable to see what that way was.If this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.  This movie is creative, thought-provoking, well-plotted, and entertaining.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any.If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.  I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.

And many people have a point - even 12 years after release, it is still an astoundingly good film on many levels.However, it is not the Wachowski's best. For that you'd have to turn to this film: an often under-rated masterpiece.I have watched this film 10 times and can honestly say that the dialogue is second only to Shakespeare (who is quoted in this more than any other modern film I've seen). Furthermore this film radiates soul and has enough raw political clout to have founded its own unintentional mass movement: Anonymous.Like the Matrix, the plot revolves around a messiah/ hero figure in the form of 'V' and is told from the perspective of the appropriately named 'Evey'.Having not (yet) read the graphic novel, I cannot tell how much of the basic plot comes from Alan Moore and how much from the Wachowski's. Indeed it is said that Alan Moore can't stand this film since 'V' is an anarchist in the novel and is more of a freedom fighter for democracy here (Alan Moore has said on record that 99% of problems are caused by 'leaders').Despite the feelings of the author, I'd say the adaptation was first rate and the film stands tall as a testament to democracy and truth. The message is so clear that, even after George W Bush has gone and terrorist scaremongering has faded, the film still stands out as a classic.It has certainly become my favourite film and I hope I've made a good case for it being the Wachowski's best. Still, if you haven't seen it, please do and make up your own mind.

176468,A3NM0RAYSL6PA8,1419838830,"Maine Writer ""David""","[10, 16]","if Natalie Portman was a better actress.  You'll probably immediately recall her fake, pained facial expressions from scenes of maudlin excess in the Star Wars prequels (which, of course, were god-awful films, but don't get me started).  And because she appears in so many scenes, and her acting is at best hit or miss, it does take V for Vendetta down a notch.  Which doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, of course.  It's been a long time since we've had such a thoughtful, beautiful, and engaging movie like this, and even more surprising that it would come from the guys who most recently brought us (yawn) the two boring and pseudo-intellectual sequels to the Matrix.  Yep, the Warchowski brothers have written a highly literate, powerful movie that you really should see.Aside from Portman (who does a stretch in a dungeon and comes out looking like a concentration camp survivor -- except that she was just as emaciated before she went in ... does she eat in real life?), the acting is really first rate.  Stephen Fry is sensational as a talk show host with a secret life, Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance from beneath a rigid mask, John Hurt is great as a power-mad 1984-style dictator, Steven Rea is wonderful as a detective with a heart, and Tim Pigott-Smith plays the stern face of evil with aplomb.All this aside, I can't help but believe that many people, blinded by modern propaganda, will mistake the world in V for Vengeance as a thinly veiled stab at the modern United States or the Bush administration.  It obviously isn't.  In fact, only an intellectual adolescent would mistake real totalitarianism for what's going on in the United States, but that discussion is for another place and time.  Moreover, the film also, by dwelling on homosexuality as much as it does (some attention to this is warranted given that sexual freedom is often controlled in totalitarian states, but it almost predominates), dilutes attention from the real victim of oppression:  expression in all of its forms, not just sexual.  Sadly, I think in today's world, however, freedom is more often associated with what a person does with their sexual organs than with the quality of their ideas.  Love is important, and sex is important too, but free thought and realm of ideas are what make us special ... and what we must die to protect if need be.All this, plus a satisfying ending.

This is of course not quite the case so the first viewing was spent waiting for what never came.  The second time around (of several viewings since) was when I began to get it, and it has since made its way toward the top of my list of all time favorites.

With duds like Glory Road, and contemptable films like Failure to Launch, Aquamarine, and The Shaggy Dog, Hollywood has been spring cleaning for the last three months.  But, now, we finally have the years first great movie.  I can already see right-wing conservative, Bush-humpers calling this film completely anti-American, and pro-terrorist.  However, what these ignorant people don't realize is this: IT'S A MOVIE FROM A COMIC BOOK!  Please think of it this way: If you had a government that was willingly killing, opressing, and controlling people, I would hope someone would stand up to them.  This film is completely fantasy.  There is only one instance in the film in which it describes America and the war in Iraq, and it really does not take it that much further.Furthermore, the special effects are fantastic, and the Wachowski brothers are able to make everything look so realistic, without getting rediculous and corny like certain movies (Fantastic Four comes to mind).  The performances are wonderful, and Stephen Rea gives his best performance since Interview With the Vampire, and I think he deserves the year's first Oscar consideration (I know it's early).  Hugo Weaving's voice performance of V is good, but it kind of sounds like Mr. Smith with a Guy Fawkes mask.  John Hurt is also great, giving a Hitler-esque performance, from everything from his spitting when he talks to his strong bodily movements.  All he needs now is a moustache.Yes, there are morals to the story, but we have really seen them all before in books like 1984 and Brave New World.

I thought it was a lot better than you might think from some of the critical reviews, but not something I will go back to again and again.The film, like the book, is set in a future Britain some 20 years after a new far-right party has won power and established a police state. To be, or even to have been, a muslim, gay, trade unionist or a political activist can be a death sentence.The heroine is Evey, played by Natalie Portman, the daughter of murdered political activists: at the start of the book she is rescued from police agents who were about to rape her by a mysterious masked man called ""V"" played by Hugo Weaving. ""V"" does not remove his mask at any time during the entire film, so Weaving has to act entirely with his voice and his body movements, which he does superlatively.""V"" blows up the Old Bailey and announces that the following 5th November he will blow up the Houses of Parliament. He also settles some old scores by killing several senior government figures who had taken part in nazi-style medical experiments on gays and dissidents.The special effects are magnifient and there is some excellent acting: both Weaving and Portman are very good, and John Hurt is superb as the deranged dictator, Adam Sutler.For all that he is playing himself rather than acting, Stephen Fry puts in a great performance as ""Gordon Dietrich"" a broadcaster and comedian who has worked within this system for years but eventually cannot resist taking the mickey out of the government. Stephen Rea is brilliant as Inspector Finch, a policeman who has been a loyal supporter of the governing party for many years but begins to have doubts when he is ordered to track down ""V"".The plot is, in places, very silly. ""V"" treats Evey in an utterly implausible way. The film starts with some misdirected hero-worship of Guy Fawkes, which if you stop to think about it is quite offensive.Fawkes was a very close 17th Century equivalent of the 9/11 suicide bombers, a man who tried to blow up hundreds of people in an attempt to force his own religion on a country which didn't want it, and his legacy was to whip up fear and hatred against people of his own faith which lasted for centuries.And before you ask, we Brits don't celebrate Guy Fawkes every 5th November - we celebrate the fact that he was caught before he and his fellow religious fanatics could bring off their version of the twin towers atrocity.Having said that, if you don't take it too seriously, this film is a good piece of light hearted, escapist fun. Perhaps that's why those who did take the original graphic novel seriously detested it.",4,A modern Guy Fawkes takes on a fascist dictatorship,1163548800,"11 15, 2006",2006,2853,"['people', 'absolutely', 'hated', 'others', 'really', 'loved', 'it.Many', 'critics', 'really', 'panned', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'author', 'original', 'novel', 'insisted', 'having', 'name', 'taken', 'off', 'credits', 'apparently', 'even', 'saw', 'thought', 'was', 'lot', 'better', 'might', 'think', 'critical', 'reviews', 'not', 'something', 'will', 'go', 'back', 'again', 'again.The', 'film', 'book', 'set', 'future', 'Britain', '20', 'years', 'new', 'far-right', 'party', 'won', 'power', 'established', 'police', 'state', 'be', 'even', 'have', 'been', 'muslim', 'gay', 'trade', 'unionist', 'political', 'activist', 'can', 'be', 'death', 'sentence.The', 'heroine', 'Evey', 'played', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'daughter', 'murdered', 'political', 'activists', 'start', 'book', 'rescued', 'police', 'agents', 'who', 'were', 'about', 'rape', 'mysterious', 'masked', 'man', 'called', 'V', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'V', 'not', 'remove', 'mask', 'time', 'entire', 'film', 'so', 'Weaving', 'act', 'entirely', 'voice', 'body', 'movements', 'superlatively', 'V', 'up', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'announces', 'following', '5th', 'November', 'will', 'blow', 'up', 'Houses', 'Parliament', 'also', 'old', 'scores', 'killing', 'several', 'senior', 'government', 'figures', 'who', 'had', 'taken', 'part', 'nazi-style', 'medical', 'experiments', 'gays', 'dissidents.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'magnifient', 'excellent', 'acting', 'Weaving', 'Portman', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'John', 'Hurt', 'superb', 'deranged', 'dictator', 'Adam', 'Sutler.For', 'playing', 'rather', 'acting', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'great', 'performance', 'Gordon', 'Dietrich', 'broadcaster', 'comedian', 'who', 'worked', 'system', 'years', 'eventually', 'can', 'not', 'resist', 'taking', 'mickey', 'government', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'brilliant', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'policeman', 'who', 'been', 'loyal', 'supporter', 'governing', 'party', 'many', 'years', 'have', 'doubts', 'when', 'ordered', 'track', 'down', 'V', '.The', 'plot', 'places', 'very', 'silly', 'V', 'Evey', 'utterly', 'implausible', 'way', 'film', 'misdirected', 'hero-worship', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'stop', 'think', 'quite', 'offensive.Fawkes', 'was', 'very', 'close', '17th', 'Century', 'equivalent', '9/11', 'suicide', 'bombers', 'man', 'who', 'tried', 'blow', 'up', 'hundreds', 'people', 'attempt', 'force', 'own', 'religion', 'country', 'did', ""n't"", 'want', 'legacy', 'was', 'whip', 'up', 'fear', 'hatred', 'people', 'own', 'faith', 'lasted', 'centuries.And', 'ask', 'Brits', 'do', ""n't"", 'celebrate', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', '5th', 'November', 'celebrate', 'fact', 'was', 'caught', 'fellow', 'religious', 'fanatics', 'could', 'bring', 'off', 'version', 'twin', 'towers', 'atrocity.Having', 'said', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'film', 'good', 'piece', 'light', 'hearted', 'escapist', 'fun', 'Perhaps', 'why', 'who', 'did', 'take', 'original', 'graphic', 'novel', 'seriously', 'detested']",N/A

How cruel the gods of entertainment truly are.  If I were to watch this film again, I would sneak a sleeping pill about a half an hour beforehand, enjoy the first explosion in the opening scene, sleep through the middle then have someone wake me up for the final explosion.  Explosion, nap, explosion; maybe then I wouldn't have objected so much to having put forth money to see this film.  That wasn't a spoiler either, as we know from the trailers what the ending of the film shall be.Natalie Portman plays Evey Hammond, a Londoner who works for the state sanctioned television network.  It's a London with obvious Orwellian rules regarding behavior, and Evey is caught after curfew by some non-uniformed enforcement officers who are preparing to rape her.  V, played by Hugo Weaving, intervenes and incapacitates the men before they can harm Evey.  He's wearing the mask of Guy Fawkes, an anti-Protestant  terrorist from seventeenth century who tried to kill off the protestant government of England by blowing up the Parliamentary building in London.Soon enough, Evey Hammond is knee deep with V and is forced into hiding after helping V take over a television network.  I guess there's some plot in the movie, since we need to understand how we get from the beginning explosion to the ending explosion.  Fascists are involved, evil pharmaceutical corporations are involved, hypocritical priests and I think they even kill off a Rush Limbaugh type character in the mix.  The message the film sends about the evils of conservatism (of which I personally am one) is heavy throughout the film.  It's an unfair caricature for sure.The obvious political message of the movie could be forgiven if it were simply a better film.  Natalie Portman's performance is unbearable.  It's hard to believe you're in London when the main protagonist can't maintain a British accent.  Portman feels almost lifeless in her role.  I guess that can be understood when you realize the other protagonist is a guy trying to act through a mask.  Hugo Weaving does his best, however it only takes a while to be completed frustrated by the mask.  Not only do we never see any facial expression, Weaving's voice is muffled and difficult to listen to behind the mask.  Eventually it's simply easier to give up trying to pay attention to the dialogue.Not that the dialogue is bad.  There are some wonderful soliloquies and exchanges in the film.  Some.  V is put forth as an extremely witty and verbose former actor who delivers theatric performances as he's starting the revolution.  Those exchanges disappear about 20 minutes into the film.There are some action sequences to the movie.  V carries around long daggers with which he fights.  The expectation of these sequences is very high considering the magnificent history the Wachowski brothers have had in special effects and cinematography with their Matrix trilogy.  However, all the action sequences (excepting the explosions at the beginning and ending of the film) come off flat and uninteresting.  The special effects are lackluster.  Huge disappointment.V for Vendetta is an over hyped movie with occasional brilliance in dialogue combined with lazy special effects, tired action sequences, fatigued performances, plot holes, slow pace and a weak script.

176479,A158NU1Y2HGA6N,1419838830,"Martin R. Goss ""People don't plan to fail, th...","[1, 3]","This film wasn't what I expected, from what I could glean of it from the cover picture and the blurb on the back of the case. I assumed V had a silent role, and that the film would be set somewhere in the former Communist eastern Europe.Once I watched it, however, I ended up getting much more than I bargained for. In short, this movie can be interpreted as a very stern warning to those who abuse power---and reminds us who gave them that power. John Hurt plays perfectly the megalomaniacal chancellor who is consumed by a desire to control everything in sight, and Natalie Portman does an excellent job of portraying Evey, who first regrets being caught up in the deadly game V plays with his former tormentors, but finally becomes his willing tool.I agree with some of the other reviewers that this movie has scenes which appear to be based on events in real life, as well as scenes from other movies. The analogy of the chancellor to Hitler is obvious, with the oversized symbol, marching before the platform, effective use of red and black to reinforce the propaganda effect, and the suggestion of a mentality meant to pervade all; the chancellor's chief servants eventually start to turn on each other, with disastrous results to his cabinet, a clear indictment of the infighting which shook the Bush administration to its core; the subway scene near the end, in which Portman cradles the dying V a la Luke Skywalker toward the end of ""Return of the Jedi""; the ruling party's infuriation at being parodied, so reminiscent of Fidel Castro's ire toward the late cartoonist Antonio Prohias; the ending with thousands of extras which was based on an actual incident in the former Yugoslavia which resulted in the downfall of Milosevic's regime; and V's disguise, his chivalrous manner, and his expertise with blades, so reminiscent of Zorro. V reminds us in brutally graphic fashion why a gentleman should never hit a lady. The only thing absent from real life is the character who holds to account everyone who took part in the conspiracy which brought them to power; presumably, that is the greatest fear of some of our leaders who've failed us (and you know who you are).As for the plot, I found it easy to follow despite its complexity and the penchant which most British film makers seem to have for dwelling a little too much on drama. About the worst I can say of this movie, however, is that Hugo Weaving as V can be a bit of a motormouth, though an impressively prosy and witty one. We eventually realize that a number of elements are introduced into the plot as it progresses, but the makers of this film do a good job of tying up all the loose ends and bringing the bouquet together, as the villainous party members take to feuding with each other as V picks them off one by one... except for the last, who finds out the hard way what it will be like to live in a changed world in which he is stripped of his power. Can you say ""emotionally castrating""?The crowning virtue of this film is the question of V's true identity. We realize at the end that the question is a moot point, but we still want to see the man behind the mask. But then, V wouldn't want me to spoil the ending, now would he?I fully recommend this film. Control freaks will find it traumatizing, but I daresay the rest of us will find it well worth the price.",5,Not what I expected from the packaging,1214524800,"06 27, 2008",2008,3342,"['film', 'was', ""n't"", 'what', 'expected', 'what', 'could', 'glean', 'cover', 'picture', 'blurb', 'back', 'case', 'assumed', 'V', 'had', 'silent', 'role', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'set', 'somewhere', 'former', 'Communist', 'eastern', 'Europe.Once', 'watched', 'however', 'ended', 'up', 'getting', 'much', 'more', 'bargained', 'short', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'interpreted', 'very', 'stern', 'warning', 'who', 'abuse', 'power', '-and', 'reminds', 'who', 'gave', 'power', 'John', 'Hurt', 'perfectly', 'megalomaniacal', 'chancellor', 'who', 'consumed', 'desire', 'control', 'everything', 'sight', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'excellent', 'job', 'portraying', 'Evey', 'who', 'first', 'being', 'caught', 'up', 'deadly', 'game', 'V', 'former', 'tormentors', 'finally', 'willing', 'tool.I', 'agree', 'other', 'reviewers', 'movie', 'scenes', 'appear', 'be', 'based', 'events', 'real', 'life', 'as', 'well', 'scenes', 'other', 'movies', 'analogy', 'chancellor', 'Hitler', 'obvious', 'oversized', 'symbol', 'marching', 'platform', 'effective', 'use', 'red', 'black', 'reinforce', 'propaganda', 'effect', 'suggestion', 'mentality', 'meant', 'pervade', 'chancellor', 'chief', 'servants', 'eventually', 'start', 'turn', 'other', 'disastrous', 'results', 'cabinet', 'clear', 'indictment', 'infighting', 'shook', 'Bush', 'administration', 'core', 'subway', 'scene', 'end', 'Portman', 'dying', 'V', 'la', 'Luke', 'Skywalker', 'end', 'Return', 'Jedi', 'ruling', 'party', 'infuriation', 'being', 'parodied', 'reminiscent', 'Fidel', 'Castro', 'ire', 'late', 'cartoonist', 'Antonio', 'Prohias', 'ending', 'thousands', 'extras', 'was', 'based', 'actual', 'incident', 'former', 'Yugoslavia', 'resulted', 'downfall', 'Milosevic', 'regime', 'V', 'disguise', 'chivalrous', 'manner', 'expertise', 'blades', 'so', 'reminiscent', 'Zorro', 'V', 'brutally', 'graphic', 'fashion', 'why', 'gentleman', 'should', 'never', 'hit', 'lady', 'only', 'thing', 'absent', 'real', 'life', 'character', 'who', 'account', 'everyone', 'who', 'took', 'part', 'conspiracy', 'brought', 'power', 'presumably', 'greatest', 'fear', 'leaders', 'who', ""'ve"", 'failed', 'know', 'who', 'are', '.As', 'plot', 'found', 'easy', 'follow', 'complexity', 'penchant', 'most', 'British', 'film', 'makers', 'seem', 'have', 'dwelling', 'little', 'too', 'much', 'drama', 'worst', 'can', 'say', 'movie', 'however', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'V', 'can', 'be', 'bit', 'motormouth', 'impressively', 'prosy', 'witty', 'one', 'eventually', 'realize', 'number', 'elements', 'are', 'introduced', 'plot', 'makers', 'film', 'do', 'good', 'job', 'tying', 'up', 'loose', 'ends', 'bringing', 'bouquet', 'together', 'villainous', 'party', 'members', 'take', 'feuding', 'other', 'V', 'off', 'one', 'one', 'last', 'who', 'out', 'hard', 'way', 'what', 'will', 'be', 'live', 'changed', 'world', 'stripped', 'power', 'Can', 'say', 'emotionally', 'castrating', 'crowning', 'virtue', 'film', 'question', 'V', 'true', 'identity', 'realize', 'end', 'question', 'moot', 'point', 'still', 'want', 'see', 'man', 'mask', 'then', 'V', 'would', ""n't"", 'want', 'spoil', 'ending', 'now', 'would', 'fully', 'recommend', 'film', 'Control', 'freaks', 'will', 'find', 'traumatizing', 'daresay', 'rest', 'will', 'find', 'well', 'price']",N/A

This is not politics...this is treason. So therefore I urge parents NOT to let your kids who are under the age of 17 see this movie. I feel that it should be pulled and re-rated NC-17 because it glorifies treason and terrorism even though the government in the film is a dictatorship.

176484,A1ET1NZ7QZKN6M,1419838830,Matthew Tundermann,"[7, 10]","V for Vendetta is a story representing a future that could very well come true based on how events could play out.  In fact, the world of ""Vendetta"" is very much like what led to the creation of Nazism and Stalinism.  The government uses fear to control and cow its population.  The citizenry cower in their homes and scurry about their business, hoping to remain out of sight and out of trouble.  Isolationism, racism, homophobia, religious radicalism, state manipulation; they all tools used by a Supreme Chancellor bent on consolidating his power and ruling a futuristic U.K. through supreme oppression.Opposing this oppression is a man, V, who represents another form of extremism.  Sometimes blurring the line between terrorist and freedom fighter, V fights against the state for the freedom of the people, yet is also consumed and driven by his own need for personal vengeance.  Having been a victim of a state-sponsored concentration camp and having been subjected to horrible experiments, V is now striking back against those who hurt him.  As a dark superhero, one wants to support V is his desire to brake the stranglehold of the oppressive Chancellor on the population, yet you are also conflicted by V's methods and motivations.  While V explains that what was done to him was 'monstrous', Evey goes further to state that V, himself, is now a monster.Evey, herself, is a woman who's life has been torn apart by the government and initially finds herself afraid to stand up against the government's atrocities.  Through V, she both finds personal strength and enhanced wisdom over the need for radical action.  Her transformation is a painful one and again leads one to question V's methods and righteousness.The last scenes, which I will not spoil, are very powerful.  The symbolism over the fall of government at the hands of the public and the need for citizens to question and act out against an oppressive government are very real ones.  The faceless masses are very artfully turned into individuals as V brings down the establishment.In general regards to the movie, the storyline moves along well.  There is action, but not as much as the previews would have you believe.  I found myself not even noticing as the ideas and controversial questions raised by the movie sucked me into the intriguing plot.  Natalie Portman as Evey, is exceptional, and though we do not see Hugo Weavings' face, his voice and body language bring a mysterious quality to V.  And as you'll hopefully appreciate at the end of the movie, V, himself becomes a symbol for all of us.If you see this movie, think about how close our own society could come to becoming the world in V for Vendetta.  If we allow fear to control us and cause us to give up our own freedom for a perceived feeling of safety, we could find ourselves in a similar world of oppression, fear, and horror.",5,Thought Provoking and Slightly Scary,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2868,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'story', 'representing', 'future', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'come', 'true', 'based', 'how', 'events', 'could', 'play', 'out', 'fact', 'world', 'Vendetta', 'very', 'much', 'what', 'led', 'creation', 'Nazism', 'Stalinism', 'government', 'fear', 'control', 'cow', 'population', 'citizenry', 'cower', 'homes', 'scurry', 'business', 'hoping', 'remain', 'sight', 'trouble', 'Isolationism', 'racism', 'homophobia', 'religious', 'radicalism', 'state', 'manipulation', 'tools', 'used', 'Supreme', 'Chancellor', 'bent', 'consolidating', 'power', 'ruling', 'futuristic', 'U.K.', 'supreme', 'oppression.Opposing', 'oppression', 'man', 'V', 'who', 'form', 'extremism', 'Sometimes', 'blurring', 'line', 'terrorist', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'V', 'fights', 'state', 'freedom', 'people', 'also', 'consumed', 'driven', 'own', 'need', 'personal', 'vengeance', 'Having', 'been', 'victim', 'state-sponsored', 'concentration', 'camp', 'having', 'been', 'subjected', 'horrible', 'experiments', 'V', 'now', 'striking', 'back', 'who', 'hurt', 'dark', 'superhero', 'one', 'support', 'V', 'desire', 'brake', 'stranglehold', 'oppressive', 'Chancellor', 'population', 'yet', 'are', 'also', 'conflicted', 'V', 'methods', 'motivations', 'V', 'what', 'was', 'done', 'was', ""'monstrous"", 'Evey', 'further', 'state', 'V', 'now', 'monster.Evey', 'woman', 'who', 'life', 'been', 'torn', 'apart', 'government', 'initially', 'afraid', 'stand', 'up', 'government', 'atrocities', 'V', 'finds', 'personal', 'strength', 'enhanced', 'wisdom', 'need', 'radical', 'action', 'transformation', 'painful', 'one', 'again', 'one', 'question', 'V', 'methods', 'righteousness.The', 'last', 'scenes', 'will', 'not', 'spoil', 'are', 'very', 'powerful', 'symbolism', 'fall', 'government', 'hands', 'public', 'need', 'citizens', 'question', 'act', 'out', 'oppressive', 'government', 'are', 'very', 'real', 'ones', 'faceless', 'masses', 'are', 'very', 'artfully', 'turned', 'individuals', 'V', 'down', 'establishment.In', 'general', 'regards', 'movie', 'storyline', 'along', 'well', 'action', 'not', 'as', 'much', 'previews', 'would', 'have', 'believe', 'found', 'not', 'even', 'noticing', 'ideas', 'controversial', 'questions', 'raised', 'movie', 'sucked', 'intriguing', 'plot', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Evey', 'exceptional', 'do', 'not', 'see', 'Hugo', 'Weavings', 'face', 'voice', 'body', 'language', 'bring', 'mysterious', 'quality', 'V.', ""'ll"", 'hopefully', 'appreciate', 'end', 'movie', 'V', 'symbol', 'us.If', 'see', 'movie', 'think', 'how', 'close', 'own', 'society', 'could', 'come', 'becoming', 'world', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'allow', 'fear', 'control', 'cause', 'give', 'up', 'own', 'freedom', 'perceived', 'feeling', 'safety', 'could', 'find', 'similar', 'world', 'oppression', 'fear', 'horror']",N/A

Love or hate it, I'm pretty sure that you will have an opinion about this polemic film, based on a comic written by Alan Moore, adapted to the big screen by the Wachowski Brothers, and directed by James McTeigue.The story begins in England, but not in the England we know. McTeigue's England is eerily similar to the country that Orwell's tells us about in ""1984"". There is a dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), that was chosen in free elections, but that afterwards decided to become an absolute ruler, exerting power without any kind of restriction. The citizens do nothing, they have relinquished their right to participate and to decide, and are merely sheep being told what to do and what to think. Their freedom is curtailed, but they feel safe.However someone is prepared to shake their certitude, and make them realize that things are not what they seem to be. That person is V (Hugo Weaving), a man that is willing to risk everything in order to turn meek sheep into citizens, and to wreak havoc on the enemies that destroyed his life a long time ago. Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman that V rescues from Sutler's minions, is a privileged spectator of V's plans, and the first person to become a fervent follower. That path, though, is not easy, as Evey's new strenght will be forged in the fires of prison.This is a highly controversial movie that delves upon difficult subjects, for example whether the end validates the means, and the power of words. All the same, ""V for Vendetta"" makes you think, has great actors, an original cinematography and a hectic pace.

Such is the plot of the sci-fi/fantasy/drama entitled ""V for Vendetta"" from 2005 that is very apropos for today's world.  The film's main character, known only as ""V"" (played by Hugo Weaving), remains hidden behind a mask for the duration of the film, which takes place in a future United Kingdom ruled by an iron-fisted chancellor, Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  With symbols reminiscent of Nazism and similarities with George Orwell's novel ""1984"", Sutler has imposed a curfew upon the entire country and has banned anything (books, art, films, etc.) that he has deemed inappropriate; but in V's secret home, V has rescued many works in the hopes that one day, democracy and freedom can be restored.  On a dark November night, V shakes the totalitarian establishment by blowing up a building in the heart of London and goes after specific individuals whom he kills and leaves a trademark rose behind.  A young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman), is caught outside after curfew by government agents, but is rescued by V, who happens to be out.  With her assistance, V gains entrance to a TV station in London and broadcasts an appeal to the nation to join with him one year from that night to witness the destruction of Parliament, but will a nation's population that has been beaten down by an overbearing government and living in fear break their bonds?  Only by watching this film will you find out, as well as the terrible means by which Sutler gained absolute power.Based upon a graphic novel of the same name by artist David Lloyd, ""V for Vendetta"" is a compelling film whose actors were very interesting and engaging.  Though the film received no Oscar nominations, Natalie Portman won a Saturn Award for Best Actress from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films.  The film also received Saturn Award nominations for Best Costume, Best Science Fiction Film and Best Writing (Larry and Andy Wachowski).  This was also James McTeigue's first film that he was director, though he has much previous experience as a second unit or assistant director for films such as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003), ""Star Wars Episode II - Attack of the Clones"" (2002), ""The Matrix"" (1999) and ""Dark City"" (1998).  His future directing endeavors will hopefully turn out to be as good, if not better, than ""V for Vendetta"".Overall, the 2005 film ""V for Vendetta"" earns a well-deserved 5 out of 5 stars and I highly recommend it to every sci-fi/fantasy film aficionado.",5,"""His hope was to remind the world that fairness, justice, and freedom are more than words""",1186790400,"08 11, 2007",2007,2642,"['nation', 'long', 'history', 'democracy', 'succumbs', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'stranglehold', 'population', 'based', 'spread', 'fear', 'fictional', 'disorder', 'terrorism', 'Such', 'plot', 'sci-fi/fantasy/drama', 'entitled', 'V', 'Vendetta', '2005', 'very', 'apropos', 'today', 'world', 'film', 'main', 'character', 'known', 'only', 'V', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'hidden', 'mask', 'duration', 'film', 'place', 'future', 'United', 'Kingdom', 'ruled', 'iron-fisted', 'chancellor', 'Adam', 'Sutler', 'John', 'Hurt', 'symbols', 'reminiscent', 'Nazism', 'similarities', 'George', 'Orwell', 'novel', '1984', 'Sutler', 'imposed', 'curfew', 'entire', 'country', 'banned', 'anything', 'books', 'art', 'films', 'etc', 'deemed', 'inappropriate', 'V', 'secret', 'home', 'V', 'rescued', 'many', 'works', 'hopes', 'one', 'day', 'democracy', 'freedom', 'can', 'be', 'restored', 'dark', 'November', 'night', 'V', 'totalitarian', 'establishment', 'blowing', 'up', 'building', 'heart', 'London', 'specific', 'individuals', 'whom', 'trademark', 'rose', 'young', 'woman', 'Evey', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'caught', 'outside', 'curfew', 'government', 'agents', 'rescued', 'V', 'who', 'be', 'out', 'assistance', 'V', 'gains', 'entrance', 'TV', 'station', 'London', 'appeal', 'nation', 'join', 'one', 'year', 'night', 'witness', 'destruction', 'Parliament', 'will', 'nation', 'population', 'been', 'beaten', 'down', 'overbearing', 'government', 'living', 'fear', 'break', 'bonds', 'Only', 'watching', 'film', 'will', 'find', 'out', 'as', 'well', 'terrible', 'means', 'Sutler', 'gained', 'absolute', 'power.Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'same', 'name', 'artist', 'David', 'Lloyd', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'compelling', 'film', 'actors', 'were', 'very', 'interesting', 'engaging', 'film', 'received', 'Oscar', 'nominations', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'won', 'Saturn', 'Award', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Academy', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Films', 'film', 'also', 'received', 'Saturn', 'Award', 'nominations', 'Best', 'Costume', 'Best', 'Science', 'Fiction', 'Film', 'Best', 'Writing', 'Larry', 'Andy', 'Wachowski', 'was', 'also', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'first', 'film', 'was', 'director', 'much', 'previous', 'experience', 'second', 'unit', 'assistant', 'director', 'films', 'such', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', '2003', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Episode', 'II', 'Attack', 'Clones', '2002', 'Matrix', '1999', 'Dark', 'City', '1998', 'future', 'directing', 'endeavors', 'will', 'hopefully', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'as', 'good', 'not', 'better', 'V', 'Vendetta', '.Overall', '2005', 'film', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'well-deserved', '5', '5', 'stars', 'highly', 'recommend', 'sci-fi/fantasy', 'film', 'aficionado']",N/A

176494,A3LZGLA88K0LA0,1419838830,Michael Butts,"[1, 5]","V FOR VENDETTA is a superbly orchestrated and well made movie, with evidence of its MATRIX lineage highly evident in the stylized feel of the movie.  Hugo Weaving does a remarkably good job considering we never see the actors face, so with his Guy Fawlkes mask always on, his character has to be accessed with his voice more than anything, and Weaving is amazing in conveying V's mission and feelings.  Natalie Portman is equally impressive as Evey, the girl he rescues from police and hides her away in his hideaway.  Their relationship develops interestingly and convincingly.  Stephen Rea as the determined Police Inspector does some of his best work since THE CRYING GAME, and John Hurt who plays the tyrannical Chancellor rises to the occasion.  The film's message is pertinent to a society where the government certainly squelches individualism and creativity, nnd the direction and camera work are brilliant.

I know, I know, how can I respect myself as a well-rounded geek if I don't read everything Alan Moore puts out?  I'm trying to catch up, give me a break.Anyway, my suspicion is that, in spite of Moore's well-known hatred of all things Hollywood, this movie does it justice.  To wit, it's the future.  The United States is no longer the major superpower, replaced by a despotic Britain that has a tight-fisted grip on its populace.  Outside, the world rages with disease (the bird flu), terrorists (including Muslim extremists), and every other ill free society offers. Well, no more.The people have spoken, out of fear, and they have elected Adam Sutler, played by John Hurt with all the bug-eyed spit of a self-styled dictator.  Sutler employs Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) as the chief of his secret service, who goes about ""black bagging"" people who are different: homosexuals, protestors, and comedians.  They're all fodder for black bagging and they're never seen again.The minions of Creedy are known as Fingers, and these Fingers have the run of Britain, including its women.  So it's no surprise when Evey (Natalie Portman, beautiful even when bald) is accosted by Fingers out for some fun.  Fortunately, a man in a mask, hat, wig, and cape known as ""V"" (with fantastic aplomb by Hugo Weaving) comes to her rescue.  Wielding only knives, he easily dispatches her opponents.  Then he shows her his ""symphony,"" blowing up a building and a symbol with a shower of fireworks.Shortly thereafter, V takes rolls out the rest of his plan: he appears on national television to call the citizens to appear on Guy Fawkes Day (November 5).  Guy Fawkes is a historical figure that planned to blow up Parliament with gunpowder, but he was captured before he could pull it off.  Apparently, V plans the very same thing (sans capture, of course).In the process, Evey discovers her past as well as her future. Merely being associated with V is too dangerous to allow her to safely exist, and it's not long before she must make a choice: about being afraid, about being loyal, about being herself, and about her love for V.Skillfully interwoven into this plot is poor Officer Finch (Stephen Rhea) as he struggles to uncover V's background. We learn many things about V, not the least of which that he is an experiment gone awry.  In essence, he is a mistake and a success, the vengeful child of a government that created him.  V is for Vengeance indeed.On a visceral level, this film could just have been about the title: revenge.  But it's so much more than that.  The touch of the Wachowski brothers is everywhere, from the dialogue to the camera shots, beautifully panning, teasing, titillating and mocking with every shot, every sound, and every line.  V is an English-major's protagonist, spouting alliterations and quoting Shakespeare.  Dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and voiced with honeyed tones by Weaving, he's instantly likable and frightening, a madcap spirit who heralds the clarion call of change.  See, now they've got me doing it!""V"" inspires you like that. Yes, there are obvious jabs at current events.  If anything, they're too obvious.  The film doesn't need to have watchwords like ""avian flu"" and ""terrorist"" interspersed throughout.  The message comes across regardless of the setting: the price of freedom is fear.Give it up at your own risk.",5,The Price of Freedom is Fear,1143936000,"04 2, 2006",2006,3435,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'one', 'must-read', 'comics', 'never', 'got', 'reading', 'know', 'know', 'how', 'can', 'respect', 'well-rounded', 'geek', 'do', ""n't"", 'read', 'everything', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'out', ""'m"", 'trying', 'catch', 'up', 'give', 'break.Anyway', 'suspicion', 'spite', 'Moore', 'well-known', 'hatred', 'things', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'justice', 'wit', 'future', 'United', 'States', 'no', 'longer', 'major', 'superpower', 'replaced', 'despotic', 'Britain', 'tight-fisted', 'grip', 'populace', 'Outside', 'world', 'disease', 'bird', 'flu', 'terrorists', 'including', 'Muslim', 'extremists', 'other', 'ill', 'free', 'society', 'offers', 'Well', 'more.The', 'people', 'have', 'spoken', 'fear', 'have', 'elected', 'Adam', 'Sutler', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'bug-eyed', 'spit', 'self-styled', 'dictator', 'Sutler', 'Creedy', 'Tim', 'Pigott-Smith', 'chief', 'secret', 'service', 'who', 'black', 'bagging', 'people', 'who', 'are', 'different', 'homosexuals', 'protestors', 'comedians', ""'re"", 'fodder', 'black', 'bagging', ""'re"", 'never', 'seen', 'again.The', 'minions', 'Creedy', 'are', 'known', 'Fingers', 'Fingers', 'have', 'run', 'Britain', 'including', 'women', 'surprise', 'when', 'Evey', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'beautiful', 'even', 'when', 'bald', 'accosted', 'Fingers', 'out', 'fun', 'Fortunately', 'man', 'mask', 'hat', 'wig', 'cape', 'known', 'V', 'fantastic', 'aplomb', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'rescue', 'Wielding', 'only', 'knives', 'easily', 'opponents', 'Then', 'symphony', 'blowing', 'up', 'building', 'symbol', 'shower', 'fireworks.Shortly', 'thereafter', 'V', 'rolls', 'out', 'rest', 'plan', 'national', 'television', 'call', 'citizens', 'appear', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'Day', 'November', '5', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'historical', 'figure', 'planned', 'blow', 'up', 'Parliament', 'gunpowder', 'was', 'captured', 'could', 'pull', 'off', 'Apparently', 'V', 'very', 'same', 'thing', 'sans', 'capture', 'course', 'process', 'Evey', 'past', 'as', 'well', 'future', 'Merely', 'being', 'associated', 'V', 'too', 'dangerous', 'allow', 'safely', 'exist', 'not', 'long', 'must', 'make', 'choice', 'being', 'afraid', 'being', 'loyal', 'being', 'love', 'V.Skillfully', 'interwoven', 'plot', 'poor', 'Officer', 'Finch', 'Stephen', 'Rhea', 'uncover', 'V', 'background', 'learn', 'many', 'things', 'V', 'not', 'least', 'experiment', 'gone', 'awry', 'essence', 'mistake', 'success', 'vengeful', 'child', 'government', 'created', 'V', 'Vengeance', 'indeed.On', 'visceral', 'level', 'film', 'could', 'just', 'have', 'been', 'title', 'revenge', 'so', 'much', 'more', 'touch', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'everywhere', 'dialogue', 'camera', 'shots', 'beautifully', 'panning', 'teasing', 'titillating', 'mocking', 'shot', 'sound', 'line', 'V', 'English-major', 'protagonist', 'spouting', 'alliterations', 'quoting', 'Shakespeare', 'Dressed', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'mask', 'voiced', 'honeyed', 'tones', 'Weaving', 'instantly', 'likable', 'frightening', 'madcap', 'spirit', 'who', 'clarion', 'call', 'change', 'See', 'now', ""'ve"", 'got', 'doing', 'V', 'Yes', 'are', 'obvious', 'jabs', 'current', 'events', 'anything', ""'re"", 'too', 'obvious', 'film', ""n't"", 'need', 'have', 'watchwords', 'avian', 'flu', 'terrorist', 'interspersed', 'message', 'regardless', 'setting', 'price', 'freedom', 'fear.Give', 'up', 'own', 'risk']",N/A
176499,A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ,1419838830,Michael K. Smith,"[1, 3]","For a lot of people, tell them a film is based on a graphic novel -- a ""comic book"" -- and they immediately write it off as juvenile. Some of us know better, though. The fact that the story a movie came from appeared first in another graphic medium has very little to do with anything. You have to evaluate the film on its own merits. This one is a combination of adventure fantasy -- bigger-than-life hero vs. superbad villains -- and political cautionary tale. It's a couple of decades in the future, the U.S. has collapsed economically and politically and is mired in civil war, and England has fallen into an authoritarian, fascist nightmare, largely with the acquiescence of its own people. Into all this steps a man in a Guy Fawkes mask with a vendetta against those in power for what they did to him in his earlier life. In the book, V's cause is anarchy; in the film, it's English freedom. (Alan Moore loathed the change in theme as ""Americanization,"" but revolution plays better in Hollywood if it's in support of democracy.) Though we never see the real, damaged face of V, the voice behind the mask is that of Hugo Weaving -- and a great voice it is, too. Natalie Portman plays Evey, the only survivor of a family that was wiped out piecemeal by the fascists, and the story also is about her climb up from constant fear. John Hurt is excellent as Sutler, the frothingly menacing Head Chancellor who glares out from an oversize TV screen like Big Brother in ""1984."" There are plenty of plot holes, mostly having to do with the ease with which V gets in and out of very high-security places to commit his executions. On the other hand, the Wachowski brothers also were responsible for the ""Matrix"" films, so you know the sfx are going to be above average -- especially the final shoot-out in the tube station and the destruction of the Houses of Parliament as witnessed by thousands of Londoners in Guy Fawkes masks. Not a bad flick, and it's obviously destined to be a cult film, but it would have been interesting to see what the Wachowskis could have done by sticking closer to the themes and details of the book.",3,Alan Moore was probably right,1257811200,"11 10, 2009",2009,2125,"['lot', 'people', 'tell', 'film', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'comic', 'book', 'immediately', 'write', 'off', 'juvenile', 'know', 'better', 'fact', 'story', 'movie', 'came', 'appeared', 'first', 'graphic', 'medium', 'very', 'little', 'do', 'anything', 'have', 'evaluate', 'film', 'own', 'merits', 'one', 'combination', 'adventure', 'fantasy', 'bigger-than-life', 'hero', 'vs.', 'superbad', 'villains', 'political', 'cautionary', 'tale', 'couple', 'decades', 'future', 'U.S.', 'collapsed', 'economically', 'politically', 'mired', 'civil', 'war', 'England', 'fallen', 'authoritarian', 'fascist', 'nightmare', 'largely', 'acquiescence', 'own', 'people', 'man', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'mask', 'vendetta', 'power', 'what', 'did', 'earlier', 'life', 'book', 'V', 'cause', 'anarchy', 'film', 'English', 'freedom', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'loathed', 'change', 'theme', 'Americanization', 'revolution', 'plays', 'better', 'Hollywood', 'support', 'democracy', 'never', 'see', 'real', 'damaged', 'face', 'V', 'voice', 'mask', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'great', 'voice', 'too', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Evey', 'only', 'survivor', 'family', 'was', 'wiped', 'out', 'piecemeal', 'fascists', 'story', 'also', 'climb', 'up', 'constant', 'fear', 'John', 'Hurt', 'excellent', 'Sutler', 'frothingly', 'menacing', 'Head', 'Chancellor', 'who', 'out', 'oversize', 'TV', 'screen', 'Big', 'Brother', '1984', 'are', 'plenty', 'plot', 'holes', 'mostly', 'having', 'do', 'ease', 'V', 'very', 'high-security', 'places', 'commit', 'executions', 'other', 'hand', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'also', 'were', 'responsible', 'Matrix', 'films', 'know', 'sfx', 'are', 'going', 'be', 'above', 'average', 'especially', 'final', 'shoot-out', 'tube', 'station', 'destruction', 'Houses', 'Parliament', 'witnessed', 'thousands', 'Londoners', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'masks', 'Not', 'bad', 'flick', 'obviously', 'destined', 'be', 'cult', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'interesting', 'see', 'what', 'Wachowskis', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'sticking', 'closer', 'themes', 'details', 'book']",N/A
176500,A1YLN3C5UIKKOX,1419838830,Michael Tozer,"[5, 8]","Yes, ""V"" is for Victory.  And the victory here celebrated is the triumph of the individual over the state.  This is the essential and overwhelmingly powerful message of this most important film.The movie is set in a futuristic London when a fascist government has seized power.  ""V"" is the shadowy anti-hero who, tortured and disfigured by totalitarian government agents, launches his own program of retribution, brilliantly begun on Guy Fawkes Day, the anniversary of history's first ""false flag"" operation, and played out to the strains of the magnificent ""1812 overture"".In an early scene, a beautiful young woman, stranded after mandatory curfew, is about to be set upon by tyrannical government agents.  ""V"" comes on the scene, saves her, roughs up the government thugs, shelters her, and reveals to her his fascinating secret life, all the while hid behind his enigmatic ""Guy Fawkes mask"".  His story is compelling.  He is the perfect anti-hero.  And yet, the young woman can't accept the brutality of his vendetta, until she herself experiences the evil of the government's torture regime.  In time, the romance that develops between the young girl, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman, and ""V"" is as wonderful as is the movie's terribly important philosophical message.Also, early in the film, the Rush Limbaugh figure of the government controlled television station is seen watching his own ranting relative to the now devastated former United States of America and bragging as to what he would do if he ever got his hands on the ""terrorist V"".  Of course, the lights in his luxury abode go low, and then, who should appear, but ""V"".  It is positively delicious.  ""V"" always leaves a red rose at the conclusion of his grisly work.As the plot unfolds, the working class stiffs of the fascist state begin to see more clearly through the government propganda they have been ""spoon fed"" through the media.  ""V"" plans a final climax on, of course, Guy Fawkes Day, a year following the beginning of the action.There is much truly amazing and terribly important historical significane built into this outstanding screen play.  The beginning scene describes the false flag operation of the ""Gunpowder Plot"" used ever since to offer a rationale for ever increasing government control of the populace.  And the climax, the actual destruction of the Parliament drips with historical and politica significance.  In English history, it was the triumph of the oligarchy, represented by the Parliament, over the popular monarchy that represented the enthronement of the money power and the crushing of indiviudal freedom.  It is the cry of freedom that screams out throughout this wonderful and truly amazing movie.  No wonder neoconservative Trotskyite apologists like Michael Medved hate this film so much.  It is the articulation of the argument of individual freedom and morality against the crushing power of the state.  A more important message than this has never emerged from Hollywood.  In your face, Michael Medved!The final scene is breathtaking.  See it.

Both have their own pros and cons, good and bad points, and while are close have different themes and come at those themes from different directions.V the movie is about a terrorist who demands that the people of England make sure a totalitarian government is held accountable for its actions.  He is a terrorist trying to get back at those who harmed him in the past.  And in doing so he may end up freeing the people from a Fascist government. But the movie delivers its message of liberation in a wonderful way that could only be called a form of art.  Hugo Weaving as V is such a good actor he can project his feelings and emotional reactions from BEHIND A MASK.  Natalie Portman, while not as powerful or as skilled as Weaving still holds up her part of the story as Evey.John Hurt as the leader was, for me, a great pick.  He was W. Smith from 1984's Nineteen Eighty-Four so I find it ironic.  Stephen Rea as the police detective is a good balance of smarts and loyalty to the government to make his character just THIS side of reality.  Stephen Fry's character brings a little more reality to the movie yet also adds the one moment of disconnect for me.  The idea that he would get away with broadcasting something on the telly that was not approved by the state-run media does seem a tad unbelievable.Add explosions to the great characters, a solid story, important themes, great fight scenes, and what you get is a Four out of Five film.Overall I enjoyed the movie even while I am also a fan of the book - to me there is no conflict.  Fan of the book or not I suggest, strongly, that you give it a try.  Rent it or get it out of the library.  I bought my copy and will very likely watch it a couple of times before my DVD gives out.Just remember, it is Rated R, so not for kiddies.  And at 132 minutes you will want lots of yummy popcorn.

Moore,"[2, 4]","I've never read the graphic novel on which James McTeigue's ""V for Vendetta"" is based, but together with the late cinematographer Adrian Biddle, McTeigue certainly makes it unforgettable on the visual level. A sort of ""1984"" crossed with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (the last of which is a major motif in the movie), ""V for Vendetta"" is the often gripping tale of a masked avenger wreaking havoc on the leaders of a brutal, neo-Fascist totalitarian regime in mid-21st Century England. Murderously intolerant of anyone who isn't a straight, fundamentalist Christian right-winger, the dystopia of ""V for Vendetta"" has parallels to those created in ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Fahrenheit 451,"" as well as some uncomfortable parallels to political and social realities in present-day England and America. McTeigue gleefully ransacks images from art, literature, theater and cinema to create a film that is never boring and often compelling, even when--particularly toward the end--its story doesn't make a lot of sense. The Wachowski Brothers' script is less interested in creating a cogent rationale and timeline for the story than in creating opportunities for making things fall down go boom; the final scenes, though visually brilliant, pose more questions than they answer. (Sure, the brothers are portraying a society in chaos, but the screenplay itself can't be chaotic.) It's a big help that the supporting players are some of the greatest talents in British Rep. Actors such as John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Rupert Graves, Stephen Fry, Tim Pigott-Smith, John Standing and Sinead Cusack play their roles with absolute conviction, adding immeasurably to the film's impact. As the masked avenger, Hugo Weaving works wonders with his body and voice, but can only partially overcome the handicap of the smirking, immobile Guy Fawkes mask he is forced to wear throughout the movie. As the young woman who becomes the avenger's helpmate and confidante, Natalie Portman is not as good as she was in ""Closer"" (a movie pretty much not worth seeing except for her), but vastly better than she was as Princess Padme in the ""Star Wars"" movies.

176507,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,1419838830,mirasreviews,"[11, 31]","The Wachowski Brothers, of ""Matrix"" fame, adapted ""V for Vendetta"" from the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, moving the action further into a dystopian future where Great Britain has exchanged obedient consent to totalitarian rule for order and peace in a world beset by violence and chaos. A single avenger (Hugo Weaving), calling himself ""V"" and wearing a smirking Guy Fawkes mask, plans to shake the population out of complacency and exact revenge on those who tortured him years ago. On the 5th of November, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes' 1605 Gunpowder Plot, V blows The Old Bailey sky high. And he warns that next year it will be the Houses of Parliament. Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) is charged with finding V and his supposed accomplice, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) whom V saved from arrest when she was out after curfew. When he is not rabble-rousing, V is leaving a trail of murder victims, whom Finch traces to a detention center that housed top secret biological research years ago. But Finch's investigation attracts the displeasure of the Chancellor (John Hurt) and secret police chief Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith).Although it is ostensibly an action movie, I found ""V for Vendetta"" mostly tedious and generally bland. ""V"" could as easily stand for ""verbose"" as ""vendetta"". V's wordy, philosophical oration would put the populace to sleep, not move them to arms. The plot is simplistic and the dialogue stilted, as you might expect of a graphic novel. The depth should be found in the story's ideas, but ""V for Vendetta"" comes up short in that department. Alan Moore, who wrote the comic, has criticized the American writers and director James McTeigue for transforming his conflict between anarchism and fascism in Britain into a critique of neo-conservatism in the United States. I have not read the graphic novel, so I must judge the film alone, which is an awkward mix of all of those ideas. There is a message about the politics of fear, as the fascist regime exploited fear of violence and disease to increase its domain in the name of national security. Citizens traded freedom for security, or the illusion of security, whether they really wanted to or not. This would be an interesting theme if it came across strongly, but unfortunately, the politics of fear is peripheral in the film.Much has been made of the idea that ""V for Vendetta"" casts a ""terrorist"" in heroic light. In fact, the film avoids the issue of terrorism almost entirely. V isn't much of a terrorist, and he's hardly heroic. He's an amoral, manipulative ideologue who treats his friends as badly as his enemies. His vendetta is one of personal vengeance. He blows up government buildings with no one in them. V doesn't kill civilians. His explosions are theater, complete with musical scores and fireworks. As terrorism is violence intended to leverage a political cause by creating fear, it would not be an effective tool against a regime whose power is rooted in the fact that everyone is afraid of the world around them. The government is the exploiter of fear, not V. So ""V for Vendetta"" is uniquely unsuited to comment on terrorism. V's violence is intended to be emblematic. It's vandalism, not terrorism. He's an anarchist. He targets institutions, not people. If you want to see a movie about revolutionary politics and terrorism, see ""The Battle of Algiers"", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of political cinema that has the added benefit of being true. ""V for Vendetta"" is the sum of shallow characters and nonsensical plot wrapped up in bland politics, and it's casual view of torture is indefensible.The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006 single disc edition): The single bonus feature is ""Freedom! Freedom! Making V for Vendetta"" (16 min), which consists mainly of interviews with producer Joel Silver, director James McTeigue, production designer Owen Paterson, and much of the cast, including Natalie Portman, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, and Hugo Weaving.

The world is very different, as the US is said to be in turmoil, while Great Britain indeed looks very powerful and strong.  Or so says their media, because in the movie's not too distant past Britain was controlled (through elections) by Sullivan (played by John Hurt) who is as much a 1984 Big Brother, as he is a president.  This is why we meet the 'terrorist' V, and Portman's character Evey, who together have both in their own way suffered under Sutler.Enough plot summary though, as I assure you that this movie will be worth your while.  Because once again, this film is smart and action-packed (thanks Wachowski brothers!); this is indeed too often becoming a rarity.

176512,A2XVA2OGDYKKD,1419838830,Monsieur Valentine,"[8, 9]","I would have to liken this experience to that of 'fight club', to some degree. Very pleasant surprise. The previews would have you believe this was going to be another mindless punch up, but riddled amongst the ""pow"" and ""bang"" we have a very intricate story about society. Being an avid fan of post-apocalyptic stories, I had read the graphic novel by Alan Moore many years ago. So I was worried what hopeless experience lay before me at the cinemas. But to the credit of the interpreters, this onscreen adaptation was for the most part, well crafted. The ideology, the philosophy, mostly intact.I am glad the movie doesnt turn this adult world into a childrens story. The action, like the comic book, takes a big back seat.I dont exactly remember the specifics of the graphic novel but I do recall some differences. The graphic novel was based on a post nuclear world. Not post-viral. And I do recall a monumental ending when Evie was suppose to take V's identity (the mask).Some key failuresIt failed to communicate the necessity of torturing Evie. It only brushed on the idea of 'losing fear'. I remember when I read the comic book, that part was absolutely monumental. It was the soul behind the story. You can not live until you accept death. If you want to detach yourself from the system, you must first break yourself... and learn to accept fate whatever it maybe. Only then can you go forward. Much like a comment I remember in 'Band of Brothers' when before a battle, the captain told his scared soldiers, ""only when you realise you are already dead, will you find courage"". And much like a person immobolised by fear, paralyzed by a system because they dont want to lose any more than they have... they must first accept 'losing everything' before they can actually learn to free themself.The second major idea I didnt see much of was the chaos theory. V's method was based on the idea that only choas will bring the right equilibrium.One area I wasn't to keen seeing was image of him walking out of the fire like some action hero. It wasnt necessary to present V as 'superhuman'... he wasnt greater than man. And that sort of iconic figure only served to reduce the realism of a 'not too distant future'.In fareness however, I walked away from this movie with some new experiences.

Weems ""emperor_weems""","[3, 5]","Let me preface my review by first saying that I am not familiar with the original graphic novel, so my review will be based on my reaction to the movie alone.What I am most impressed by is the commentary that is quite naturally found in this movie.  The theme is quite old, but wonderfully universal--the abuse of power by the powerful to entrap the common and weak.  Because of that, the movie makes not very veiled references to George Orwell (by not only using John Hurt, who starred in the movie 1984, but to dress him up as Big Brother from that movie and have him appear, through most of the movie, on a large TV screen) and even George Bush (with a second-in-command that smacks of Dick Cheney).  Though the references seems a little cliche at times, they are quite effective.  This is the greatest strength of sci-fi--to investigate present times and comment upon them in a form that doesn't seem like political commentary.  This was the purest strength of The Matrix--a movie, essentially, about the removal of humanity from an electronic world, and how to become human once again THROUGH that technology instead of DESPITE it.In this movie, we have an England that is run by a hard-edged morality that outlaws and bans what it doesn't like.  V, after a chance rescue of Evie (Natalie Portman), begins to induct her into his plan to free England, in much the same way as his idol Guy Fawkes attempted back in the 17th century.  But of course this time around, the stakes are higher, in that a mysterious biogenic weapon has created a lot of hysteria about terrorists and has given the government power to keep tabs on EVERYONE (sound familiar?).  Evie begins to investigate the truth of things, and everything unfolds from there.Some criticisms of this movie have decried the close connections of V to actual terrorists, but V clearly has a purpose to bring society together rather than tear it apart.Hugo Weaving, a brilliant actor (Mr. Smith) is stunning in this, though his face is rarely ever visible.  And the idea of plans within plans falls through a little bit, leaving some confusing movements towards the end, but the extent of the conspiracies presented here will keep necessary arguments going on for years.  The plotline of V as somewhat superhuman didn't quite seem to fit into this movie--it would seem that he would have been just as effective as someone who hadn't been 'enhanced,' but perhaps this was an element of the graphic novel that held more purpose there.In all, this was an excellent movie.  Exciting, action-packed and meaningful.

Great supporting cast from the lead detective, the news anchors, the chancelor and all the rest.  Wonderful.  Then there's Natalie Portman.  She could easily have become an over the top super heroine, but instead maintained her status as one of the common folk dealing with circumstances.  She was terrific. Finally, when it comes to acting, Hugo Weaving who wears a mask through the whole film delivers a complex character, making him human, caring and frightening at the same time.  He does it without the benefit of facial expressions, although through his body language you can imagine his expressions.  Now there is an excellent piece of work.  All of these fine performances are done in what is almost a comic book movie.  V is a hero for the masses, almost a Batman against the establishment.  I've seen this movie several times and have enjoyed it every time.  This one goes beyond the action film.  This one gives characters with depth.

Durham ""Big Evil""","[2, 5]","After watching the big screen adaptation of V For Vendetta, it's safe to say that I don't blame Alan Moore one bit for not wanting anything to do with it.  After seeing his From Hell, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and now this made into films, it's of little wonder why he wants nothing to do with the movie industry.  That aside, the film version of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, and it has some great moments and echos the atmosphere of the comic, but the changes made by the Wachowski Brothers downplays the morality tale that Moore so brilliantly weaved in the 80's when he foresaw a bleak and totalitarian future; one of which is becoming more and more frighteningly real by the day.  Natalie Portman is a combination of worthy and wooden in the role of Evey Hammond, a would be everyman who gets involved with a Guy Fawkes-mask wearing terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving, surprisingly perfectly cast) who plans to strike back against the oppressive British rule.  The sets, design (V's outfit has been wonderfully re-created) and action scenes are all well done, mainly by most of the crew members who worked on the Matrix films, and James McTeigue makes a solid debut as a director; but Moore's message gets lost in all the glossy action.  John Hurt is here as Sutler, the maniacal zealot Chancellor, and while it's good to see both Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry in big roles in a big picture, particularly Rea as the disenchanted inspector who has been assigned to the case.

Admist this out-lying message, and montage of revolution, there are several well thought out fight scenes and sly assassinations carried out by V, leading up to the films ""revolutionary"" climax and Matrix-esque slow-motion ending that everyone has been talking about. In a nut-shell, it attempts to be both political and violent, but in the end masters neither aspect. However, if you go into the movie with an open mind, I doubt you will be disapointed... If you are expecting harrowing, controversial political ideals and messages, or the blockbuster action film of the year... well, look else where. As for the DVD itself, I was impressed by the special features offered in the Special Edition. While the second disk isn't quite as spectacular as I was hoping, it still includes a fine amount of featuretes, making the Special Edition far superior to the average cut of the DVD.",4,"explosions, revolutions, and ideals abound",1154390400,"08 1, 2006",2006,1765,"['went', 'see', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'open', 'mind', 'walked', 'away', 'rather', 'satisfied', ""'ll"", 'keep', 'short', 'sweet', 'not', 'delve', 'whole', 'mess', 'politics', 'plot', 'discussions', 'many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'done', 'title', 'instead', 'offer', 'only', 'unflinching', 'opinion', 'Spec-Ed', 'DVD', 'movie', 'was', 'first', 'impressed', 'production', 'values', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'decent', 'script', 'title', 'character', 'V', 'mutters', 'so', 'much', 'political', 'mumbo-jumbo', 'high', 'pace', 'may', 'want', 'watch', 'second', 'time', 'sub-titles', 'corse', 'have', 'herd', 'much', 'hate', 'twards', 'film', 'parties', 'expecting', 'offer', 'more', 'political', 'view', 'more', 'action', 'short', 'political', 'ideals', 'presented', 'here', 'are', 'nothing', 'revolutionary', 'mearly', 'ment', 'make', 'ponder', 'how', 'quickly', 'human', 'beings', 'are', 'willing', 'sacrifice', 'freedom', 'safety', 'Admist', 'out-lying', 'message', 'montage', 'revolution', 'are', 'several', 'well', 'thought', 'out', 'fight', 'scenes', 'sly', 'assassinations', 'carried', 'out', 'V', 'leading', 'up', 'films', 'revolutionary', 'climax', 'Matrix-esque', 'slow-motion', 'ending', 'everyone', 'been', 'talking', 'nut-shell', 'be', 'political', 'violent', 'end', 'aspect', 'However', 'go', 'movie', 'open', 'mind', 'doubt', 'will', 'be', 'disapointed', 'are', 'expecting', 'harrowing', 'controversial', 'political', 'ideals', 'messages', 'blockbuster', 'action', 'film', 'year', 'well', 'look', 'else', 'where', 'DVD', 'was', 'impressed', 'special', 'features', 'offered', 'Special', 'Edition', 'second', 'disk', ""n't"", 'quite', 'as', 'spectacular', 'was', 'hoping', 'still', 'fine', 'amount', 'featuretes', 'making', 'Special', 'Edition', 'far', 'average', 'cut', 'DVD']",N/A

176527,A3SU3TXON36T0X,1419838830,"New Age of Barbarism ""zosimos""","[13, 48]","_V for Vendetta_ is a film adaptation of a graphic novel which pits an anarchist protagonist against a fascist government.  The film raises several interesting philosophical questions but ultimately it is severely damaged by the type of political correctness all too often seen emanating from Hollywood.First, the movie raises the issue as to whether violence in any form is ever justified.  Obviously the absolute pacifist ethic runs into severe problems when put into practice and in extreme situations in which one must choose between one's own life and the life of a perpetrator.  Even the idea that one should never initiate force (although which may allow for force to be used in defense against force) runs into difficulties when faced with familiar scenarios such as a mother using force to prevent her child from running into traffic.  To this extent, I agree with the movie that force is permissible as a defense against unjust political regimes.  The movie also speaks to the power of symbolism and symbolic actions.  Thus, the destruction of parliament by the (ambiguous) ""hero"" V is justified in the movie through the idea that it represents a symbol of a corrupt regime that must be toppled.  Secondly the movie raises the issue as to the unethical nature of state sanctioned scientific experimentation on unwitting individuals.  Both totalitarian states and the United States government have engaged in such experimentation (consider for example, the CIA's experiments in mind control and LSD research).  To this extent, I agree with the basic message.However, despite my reserved agreement with this movie on these two points, I must note that its message is severely damaged by political correctness.  In today's world it is political correctness that poses the greatest totalitarian threat.  Despite the current regime's claim to be ""conservative"", Bush is in fact nothing of the sort.  The government continues to grow and impinge upon the liberties of American citizens.  (Your property can now be confiscated by the state to generate greater tax revenue according to a recent Supreme Court decision.)  Affirmative action and abortion continue to grow in magnitude.  Illegal immigrants continue to overrun the United States (as well as Europe).  And, valuable resources are being wasted on a senseless war in Iraq.  Whether the Democrats or the Republicans win the next election the results will be the same:  greater state interference in the lives of ordinary Americans and the continued threat of ever greater globalization.  In the movie, Christians and ""fascists"" play the role of unambiguous ""bad guys"".  The bishop who appears in the movie has an unsavory sexual appetite and is involved in the creation of the death camps.  Homosexuality is glorified and made to appear a victim of a fascist regime.  In today's world, political correctness is by far the stronger force and the various communist regimes which have been propped up through the help of finance capital are never mentioned in the movie.  While the fascists and Nazis murdered approximately 25 million individuals, the communists may have murdered as many as 100 to 200 million.  This difference is staggering.  Certainly government can be a great evil, but by painting all enemies of political correctness as proponents of the state, this movie has severely undermined its own premise.  This is especially ironic given the way in which politically correct forces collude with the state to censor and promote violence against those who disagree.  It is in this respect, that I firmly oppose what this movie stands for, despite its apparent philosophical interest.",2,Philosophically Interesting but Marred by Political Correctness.,1146614400,"05 3, 2006",2006,3654,"['_V', 'Vendetta_', 'film', 'adaptation', 'graphic', 'novel', 'anarchist', 'protagonist', 'fascist', 'government', 'film', 'several', 'interesting', 'philosophical', 'questions', 'ultimately', 'severely', 'damaged', 'type', 'political', 'correctness', 'too', 'often', 'seen', 'emanating', 'Hollywood.First', 'movie', 'issue', 'violence', 'form', 'ever', 'justified', 'Obviously', 'absolute', 'pacifist', 'ethic', 'severe', 'problems', 'when', 'put', 'practice', 'extreme', 'situations', 'one', 'must', 'choose', 'one', 'own', 'life', 'life', 'perpetrator', 'Even', 'idea', 'one', 'should', 'never', 'initiate', 'force', 'may', 'allow', 'force', 'be', 'used', 'defense', 'force', 'difficulties', 'when', 'faced', 'familiar', 'scenarios', 'such', 'mother', 'using', 'force', 'prevent', 'child', 'running', 'traffic', 'extent', 'agree', 'movie', 'force', 'permissible', 'defense', 'unjust', 'political', 'regimes', 'movie', 'also', 'power', 'symbolism', 'symbolic', 'actions', 'Thus', 'destruction', 'parliament', 'ambiguous', 'hero', 'V', 'justified', 'movie', 'idea', 'symbol', 'corrupt', 'regime', 'must', 'be', 'toppled', 'Secondly', 'movie', 'issue', 'unethical', 'nature', 'state', 'sanctioned', 'scientific', 'experimentation', 'unwitting', 'individuals', 'totalitarian', 'states', 'United', 'States', 'government', 'have', 'engaged', 'such', 'experimentation', 'consider', 'example', 'CIA', 'experiments', 'mind', 'control', 'LSD', 'research', 'extent', 'agree', 'basic', 'message.However', 'reserved', 'agreement', 'movie', 'two', 'points', 'must', 'note', 'message', 'severely', 'damaged', 'political', 'correctness', 'today', 'world', 'political', 'correctness', 'greatest', 'totalitarian', 'threat', 'current', 'regime', 'claim', 'be', 'conservative', 'Bush', 'fact', 'nothing', 'sort', 'government', 'grow', 'impinge', 'liberties', 'American', 'citizens', 'property', 'can', 'now', 'be', 'confiscated', 'state', 'generate', 'greater', 'tax', 'revenue', 'according', 'recent', 'Supreme', 'Court', 'decision', 'Affirmative', 'action', 'abortion', 'continue', 'grow', 'magnitude', 'Illegal', 'immigrants', 'continue', 'overrun', 'United', 'States', 'as', 'well', 'Europe', 'valuable', 'resources', 'are', 'being', 'wasted', 'senseless', 'war', 'Iraq', 'Democrats', 'Republicans', 'win', 'next', 'election', 'results', 'will', 'be', 'same', 'greater', 'state', 'interference', 'lives', 'ordinary', 'Americans', 'continued', 'threat', 'ever', 'greater', 'globalization', 'movie', 'Christians', 'fascists', 'play', 'role', 'unambiguous', 'bad', 'guys', 'bishop', 'who', 'movie', 'unsavory', 'sexual', 'appetite', 'involved', 'creation', 'death', 'camps', 'Homosexuality', 'glorified', 'made', 'appear', 'victim', 'fascist', 'regime', 'today', 'world', 'political', 'correctness', 'far', 'stronger', 'force', 'various', 'communist', 'regimes', 'have', 'been', 'propped', 'up', 'help', 'finance', 'capital', 'are', 'never', 'mentioned', 'movie', 'fascists', 'Nazis', 'murdered', 'approximately', '25', 'million', 'individuals', 'communists', 'may', 'have', 'murdered', 'as', 'many', '100', '200', 'million', 'difference', 'staggering', 'Certainly', 'government', 'can', 'be', 'great', 'evil', 'painting', 'enemies', 'political', 'correctness', 'proponents', 'state', 'movie', 'severely', 'undermined', 'own', 'premise', 'especially', 'ironic', 'given', 'way', 'politically', 'correct', 'forces', 'collude', 'state', 'censor', 'promote', 'violence', 'who', 'disagree', 'respect', 'firmly', 'oppose', 'what', 'movie', 'apparent', 'philosophical', 'interest']",N/A

However, V for Vendetta does not suffer such a fate. There are some discrepancies, of course, but the film as a whole is highly successful and very entertaining.V for Vendetta is very well cast with loveable and hateable foils that make the film easy to follow. Portman is a joy as usual (not always). She is more than sufficient and brings much to her role as Evey. I was disappointed that they changed her profession (readers will catch my drift). However, the heart of her character is the same, and Portman does her finest, most touching work since Closer. V is well cast as well. I actually like the voice of Weaving coming from beneath that mocking mask, and his chemistry with Portman is remarkable considering that they are never actually face-to-face.The political aims (Bush etc.) in the film are fairly open, and can sometimes be distracting. However, as a whole the film is true to spirit of the novel. The air of revolution is thick with ideals and freedom, and one can actually see the people coming to life.

There is a fair amount of ironic US-bashing, well deserved and on target, and the England on offer here is Margaret Thatcher's wet dream. That may tell you a little bit about the times in which the story was conceived, but to everyone's credit, it is told crisply as though it were a straight narravtive. That helps enormously in a film. The director got the point of letting the graphics help tell the story and set the tone. Nothing is gratuitous, and that's notable all in its own right.My quibbles with the film are slight: sound balance is way off: Hugo Weaving's dialogue is in such hushed tones that I was constantly adjusting the volume to hear him recite Shakespeare, then backing it down for the explosions. For that matter, it may not even be Weaving behind the mask. His voice over might well have been phoned in. V nods toward Eavey or one of the other characters, and there are action sequences, but nothing to suggest that Weaving is actually there. Still, it's a good film.The extras are for the geeks.I go back to the Moore dust-up. My guess is he's a stereo-typical art student who wants to be contrary for the sake of being contrary. I suspect it's all contrived anyway. As David Lloyd opined: if he is that upset, give back the check.For everyone else, enjoy the film, it's a good story that ought to be told in these times.",4,"Truth is, the story is timely and very well done",1156118400,"08 21, 2006",2006,2186,"['Lord', 'what', 'bug', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'up', 'bum', 'having', 'read', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'seen', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'what', 'brouhaha', 'about', 'David', 'Llyod', 'collaborated', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'not', 'Moby', 'Dick', 'were', 'concerns', 'artistic', 'front', 'Lloyd', 'would', 'be', 'one', 'essentially', 'COMIC', 'BOOK', 'story', 'fleshed', 'out', 'live', 'actors', 'special', 'effects', 'extremely', 'well', 'done', 'true', 'source', 'i.e', 'COMIC', 'BOOK.As', 'movie', 'lot', 'fun', 'watch', 'lot', 'more', 'sense', 'soft-headed', 'geeky-theory', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'derived', 'Orwell', 'course', 'effects', 'are', 'good', 'acting', 'over-the-top', 'resorting', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'ham-fisting', 'point', 'story', 'given', 'political', 'climate', 'world', 'today', 'hardly', 'far-fetched', 'fair', 'amount', 'ironic', 'US-bashing', 'well', 'deserved', 'target', 'England', 'offer', 'here', 'Margaret', 'Thatcher', 'wet', 'dream', 'may', 'tell', 'little', 'bit', 'times', 'story', 'was', 'conceived', 'everyone', 'credit', 'told', 'crisply', 'were', 'straight', 'narravtive', 'enormously', 'film', 'director', 'got', 'point', 'letting', 'graphics', 'help', 'tell', 'story', 'set', 'tone', 'Nothing', 'gratuitous', 'notable', 'all', 'own', 'right.My', 'quibbles', 'film', 'are', 'slight', 'sound', 'balance', 'way', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'dialogue', 'such', 'hushed', 'tones', 'was', 'constantly', 'adjusting', 'volume', 'hear', 'recite', 'Shakespeare', 'then', 'backing', 'down', 'explosions', 'matter', 'may', 'not', 'even', 'be', 'Weaving', 'mask', 'voice', 'might', 'well', 'have', 'been', 'phoned', 'V', 'nods', 'Eavey', 'one', 'other', 'characters', 'are', 'action', 'sequences', 'nothing', 'suggest', 'Weaving', 'actually', 'there', 'Still', 'good', 'film.The', 'extras', 'are', 'geeks.I', 'go', 'back', 'Moore', 'dust-up', 'guess', 'stereo-typical', 'art', 'student', 'who', 'be', 'contrary', 'sake', 'being', 'contrary', 'suspect', 'contrived', 'anyway', 'David', 'Lloyd', 'opined', 'upset', 'give', 'back', 'check.For', 'everyone', 'else', 'enjoy', 'film', 'good', 'story', 'ought', 'be', 'told', 'times']",N/A

Part ""1984"" part ""Soylent Green"" and part ""THX 1138"", ""V for Vendetta"" explores the political climate of a country that has gone too far down the road of facism in the name of safety.The movie explains through the back story that the United States is in a state of civil war and England has been through its own version of troubles , but has avoided the problems the States faced through a very conservative government based on safety.  The problem is that the government has taken control of the lives of its citizenry.  Big brother has developed and the state controls the media.  A figure only known as ""V"" emerges and terrorizes the government.  ""V"" originally saves the character Eva in the begining of the film from government agents and then slowly turns her into a revolutionary by the end of the film.The film is a study of what happens when a government creates a monster.  The monster turns on the creator.  The film is very dark and shot much of the time in shadows which heightens the intensity beautifully.  Stephen Rea is wonderfull as the chief inspector trying to prevent a revolution as well as looking into the government corruption.  Hugo Weaving is good as V and John Hurt makes a creepy high chancellor.  Only Natalie Portman is wasted here.  Not that she is bad, just underused and could have been played by any young and up-and-coming actress.""V for Vendetta"" was originally a graphic novel and was written as a critique for the Thatcher government.  The film has been updated to include a observation of Bush's war on terror.  That if the safety issue is taken too far then society will rise up.  This is a very good film and thought provoking.  Not of all of it is easy to understand and you can't help the feeling the good guy is really very bad also.  My only criticism is that the film borders on a couple of genres without deciding which one to become.  It is certainly suspensefull, but it can also be sci fi or a political movie.

If you, like me, found the comic book version of V to be deeply moving and influential, I can't recommend that you watch the movie version.  If you haven't read the comic, go ahead and see the movie, but then go and read the far superior book.Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (surprisingly) both provide very solid performances as V and Evey, and the design of the film was perfect.  My only problems are the changes to the script which diluted the original story and replaced it with a happy and unambiguous ending.  There are at least four important scenes in the original book's narrative; V's backstory, Evey's imprisonment, the history of the woman in room IV, and V's death.  The film only gets two of these scenes done well (the imprisonment and the woman in room IV) while the other scences were deleted or changed in ways which made them meaningless.Judged on its own merits, the movie is not bad, but anyone who is interested in the storytelling should read Alan Moore's graphic novel instead.  Had the movie stayed true to Moore's original exploration of totalitarianism and anarchy, this could have been a masterpiece.  As it stands, its an engaging piece of entertainment but not anything more.As a contemporary political movie, I was impressed that the movie was so willing to address issues of terrorism and treason against a totalitarian state.

This character, a very well educated, cultured individual dead set on bringing down the Orwellian nightmare that is all around him, draws the grateful young girl into his world, giving her selective information on himself, judging her own possible inclination toward rebellion.This character wears a stylized Guy Fawkes ""mask"" 24/7, giving him a bizarre, stage-like appearance, with his permanent ""expression"" basically a smug grin topped by narrowed eyes. Hugo Weaving gives a terrific performance as the cultured ""V"", amazing you with his eloquence and style, not to mention his ruthlessness and determination in his mission. Another fine performance is given by John Hurt, as the main villain in the piece, the grand leader of the dystopic government, Chancellor Adam Suttler. Odd that the actor who played the victimized Winston Smith in 1984's ""Nineteen-Eighty-Four"", should play Big Brother in this piece. Natalie Portman provides a waifish, affecting visual as Evey, ""V""'s essential ""sidekick"" in the film, but her attempt to synthesize a British accent leaves a little to be desired.""Blackadder"" and ""Wooster and Jeeves""'s Stephen Fry portrays Dietrich, a government approved wag that broadcasts his show to mollify the masses, until he decides to go after Suttler himself in one final episode of his TV show. Other actors involved are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Sinead Cusack as a medical technician that has some history with ""V"".There is a Mephistophelean quality to ""V"" that will have you fascinated with him from the very beginning. Weaving's subtle, sometimes graceful performance, (the violent scenes are choreographed like ballet!) ought to at least have him CONSIDERED for an oscar nod! You are constantly amazed at: how well informed he is, how cultured he is, and how intelligent and resourceful and adept he is.But all this still doesn't counter what I think is an ending that sends a bad message. In the end (spoiler alert!) both Parliament and BIG BEN are blown up as ""V"" is given a viking sendoff by young Evey. This is after, in one of the opening scenes, Old Bailey is blown up as well!

The hero is, yes, a terrorist - a well read, articulate terrorist who loves music and old movies and has plans to change London by blowing a good deal of it to smithereens, unseating a fuhrer-esque dictator of a totalitarian regime full of shadowy underlings from power and, in turn, give the city back to its people, for, as V himself says, ""People should not fear their governments, governments should fear the people,"" or something to that effect.  V spends a good portion of the film donning his mask and debonair get-up as he dispatches one by one a group of people with dark ties to the masked avenger himself - think secret government-funded experiments, concentration camps, etc.  He reaches out to the people of London by highjacking the television airwaves to deliver his message of revolt.  He rescues and befriends a cute-as-a-button Natalie Portman.  He blows some stuff up.  And, one year later, he plans on destroying Parliament.  Talk about a revolution indeed.As action films go this one certainly has a bit of brains and is, by far, better than most.  Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore who has universally hated all of the big screen adaptions of his work and subsequently had his name removed from this film, but nevertheless accepted the check, I'm sure, and cashed it hastily.  The Maxtrix team wrote it - the  Wachowski Brothers - and it is directed with style and flare by James McTeigue.  Good show!  Did I mention how cute Natalie Portman is?This movie might not have been made a few years ago.  That was another thing that kept crossing my mind while watching V for Vendetta.  I'm not quite sure what the message of the film is, if any.  Can terrorism be justified?  Interesting.

I believe this is a film that will become more revered with age. Sure these are themes that have been seen before (it was based on a graphic novel written in the 1980's after all) but I think the themes are still very important today.

People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independant thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Micheal Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is concidered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We are quickly declining into a fascist state as long as our current president is in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definetly time to stop all of the hate crimes! Has anyone ever stopped to think that when the Twin Towers fell in NYC, they ""imploded"", like a building would do when it is being demolished and bombs are in the BOTTOM of the building, not near one of the top floors!

And, why did the president feel the need to go after Sadam when it was allegedly Bin Laden that we should have went after? More questions than answers. It's because the terrorist act was committed by our very own government! And I have noticed that after they started taking God out of the USA, the USA has gone downhill like a bobsled on a THICK sheet of ice. I don't mean ""religion"", for God and religion are two seperate things all together. And, I don't mean to sound as if I'm defending any kind of religous zealots (fanatics), like our president, who is doing all of this in a very scary religous fervor, while countless people 'sleep' and declare him the best president ever.

Our freedoms are being stripped one by one. This film is about a facist government that installs fear in its people by acts of terrorism, blaming such acts on 'enemy' foreigners, when the acts were committed by the very same government that's supposed to be protecting the people from such terrorist acts; like our own country! I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state. It will bring out the 'commie' in most people who oppose our fascist politicians and the ongoing senseless war. This is without a doubt a masterpiece, entertaining and bravely 'open' about our current state of political stance in our 'free' world. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independent, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Michael Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"".We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is considered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We started quickly declining into a fascist state when our former president was in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definitely time to stop all of the hate crimes!This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over. It's political and romantic, and very intelligent. Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius! Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast! It is definitely one you will want to own so you can view it over and over, like a favorite album.

Changes in comic book story from the original material to movies happen way too much in Hollywood for my tastes but they happen. Why movie execs can't trust the decisions made by writers in other mediums is beyond me...Still, V shines through. I liked the beefed-up character of Evey. Natalie did a great job. Her acting was spot-on! Sometimes the visuals were amazing. Sometimes they were too Matrix for my taste. The acting was great and Hugo Weaving was fantastic, doing more acting even though he wore a mask than most actors do when they aren't wearing a mask. Good performances from two Stephens, Frey and Rea. John Hurt was truly frightening as the Chancellor.There were some things I would like to have seen from Graphic Novel. I would like to have seen the train scene in the beginning and I think it would have been better if they had kept in that a computer was basically running the government. Also, I wish they had gone into Finch's transformation at Larkhill a little more. There was more character development in the graphic novel.Things I'd wish they'd not had in the movie: too much of a love story between V and Evey. The end seen with the Fingermen and V was too Matrix and too Crow! And too gory. Blood was on a minimum through the whole movie (and I'm complaining here because I'm squeamish - far from it) and then you get to the fight between the Fingermen and V and there's blood flying out in great splashes. It was uneven with the rest of the movie.Overall, I liked the movie. It was solid, entertaining, and well executed. It didn't make me think as much as Allan Moore's graphic novel did.

So many people, including myself, viewed this movie as Left-wing propaganda in Great Britain projected onto the political climate in the US.  In fact, I hated the film, as it portrayed the terrorist as the good guy, or maybe in this case, the anti-hero.  BUT, as I rewatch this movie in 2009 with now ~9 months of the Obama Adminstration in charge of America, I see this ""fascist"" portrayal of the UK as more of a reflection of the current Obama Administration.  YES...I said it.  The Obama Administration.As we see in the movie, V's overall motive and theme is ""People should not fear their government, the government should fear its people.""  Sure, the Hitler-like and militaristic methods of the UK government in this film are a bit ""right-wingish"" imagery (which I'd argue is incorrect on the fact that Nationalized Socialism is anything but ""right-wing""), BUT that aside, the policies of this UK government, like the stiffling of free speech, especially the comedic bit mocking the chancellor (oh, where have we heard that title before?  1936 Germany perhaps?) is exactly like what the Obama Adminstration is doing these days.  One example being telling a health insurance company to cease and desist their advertising campaign regarding the possible cut to Medicare.  Umm, First Amendment rights violation right there.  I don't care if the ad is correct or not, they have a right say it.And in the end of the film where we see a ""mob"" of people dressed in V's cape and mask ascend to the Parlimentary building to watch it blow up.

I was totally taken by surprise by it, as I never expected such a genre to  be so thought-provoking and deep to the point of pure and plain philosophical despair. Back then I even dared to define the ""Trilogy"" as ""subversive"" due to the unparalleled analogies between the fictional virtual world of Zion and its unbelievable reminiscences of so many realities in so many levels...However shocked by The Matrix Trilogy, I still believed it to be just a lucky strike in the elusive and unknown world of a pair of siblings who call themselves the Wachowski Brothers.My perception about the Wachowski's, however, drastically changed (and how) after watching the anarchic ""V for Vendetta"" (screenplay written by the Wachowski). As for the word ""subversive""... well it falls short to describe the kind of message taken out by all of these movies as a whole. And don't get me wrong here. I do not condemn the subject and neither its treatment or implications. On the contrary, I am thankful for it as it had made so many out there realize how  any form of fundamentalism (whether you call it communism, fascism, nazism, populism and also, anarchism) are so close to one another. Just like extremes of a serpent that bites its own tail. Fundamentalisms of all kind and the painful similarities between them (in scope, in methods, in objectives) should leave us all with a lesson. And I just hope that kids out there that watch these movies just for the fun of the amazing aesthetics and the overwhelming digital effects somehow get to see beyond the surface and dare to explore the undergrounds.As I come back to a particular phrase in ""V"" (""Peoples should not be afraid of their Governments: Governments should be afraid of their Peoples"") I wonder how we got to the point in which (again) 5th. of Novembers are seemingly perceived as the ultimate solutions.",5,And the Wachowski Brothers' Magical Mistery Tour goes on...,1162944000,"11 8, 2006",2006,1995,"['Wachowski', 'brothers', 'virtual', 'opera', 'prima', 'Matrix', 'Trilogy', 'one', 'few', 'movies', 'have', 'absolutely', 'completely', 'watched', 'awe', 'was', 'totally', 'taken', 'surprise', 'never', 'expected', 'such', 'genre', 'be', 'so', 'thought-provoking', 'deep', 'point', 'pure', 'plain', 'philosophical', 'despair', 'Back', 'then', 'even', 'dared', 'define', 'Trilogy', 'subversive', 'due', 'unparalleled', 'analogies', 'fictional', 'virtual', 'world', 'Zion', 'unbelievable', 'reminiscences', 'so', 'many', 'realities', 'so', 'many', 'levels', 'However', 'shocked', 'Matrix', 'Trilogy', 'still', 'believed', 'be', 'just', 'lucky', 'strike', 'elusive', 'unknown', 'world', 'pair', 'siblings', 'who', 'call', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers.My', 'perception', 'Wachowski', 'however', 'drastically', 'changed', 'how', 'watching', 'anarchic', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Wachowski', 'word', 'subversive', 'well', 'short', 'describe', 'kind', 'message', 'taken', 'out', 'movies', 'whole', 'do', ""n't"", 'get', 'wrong', 'here', 'do', 'not', 'condemn', 'subject', 'treatment', 'implications', 'contrary', 'am', 'thankful', 'had', 'made', 'so', 'many', 'there', 'realize', 'how', 'form', 'fundamentalism', 'call', 'communism', 'fascism', 'nazism', 'populism', 'also', 'anarchism', 'are', 'so', 'close', 'one', 'Just', 'extremes', 'serpent', 'own', 'tail', 'Fundamentalisms', 'kind', 'painful', 'similarities', 'scope', 'methods', 'objectives', 'should', 'leave', 'lesson', 'just', 'hope', 'kids', 'there', 'watch', 'movies', 'just', 'fun', 'amazing', 'aesthetics', 'overwhelming', 'digital', 'effects', 'somehow', 'get', 'see', 'surface', 'dare', 'explore', 'undergrounds.As', 'come', 'back', 'particular', 'phrase', 'V', 'Peoples', 'should', 'not', 'be', 'afraid', 'Governments', 'Governments', 'should', 'be', 'afraid', 'Peoples', 'wonder', 'how', 'got', 'point', 'again', '5th', 'Novembers', 'are', 'seemingly', 'perceived', 'ultimate', 'solutions']",N/A

As for the movie itself - I was disappointed with the main character. ""V"" fought the old school way with sharp words and long daggers. He wore a mask throughout the whole movie (showing no emotion whatsoever, obviously). He spoke like Shakespeare's evil twin brother... and I grew tired of it quickly. His ideals were that of a tragic vigilanty solely possessed on striking back at government - in an artsy idealistic kind of way. The movie starts with ""V"" hell bent on life - so unless you know something about the story before entering the theater - you have no idea where this inflamed scorn is coming from.

176580,A2EW96AE53PZMK,1419838830,Richard De Angelis,"[0, 2]","WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS A MAJOR PLOT SPOILER!I should start by admitting outright that I did enjoy many parts of the V for Vendetta movie (primarily those that remained truest to the source material), and by stating my agreement with other reviewers familiar with thegraphic novelon which it was based that it is the best film adaptation of an Alan Moore work to date. In fact, had I never heard of the book, I would have probably enjoyed the film much more than I did (and I did appreciate it much more when I watched it for the second time on this DVD set). I am always impressed when any mainstream, major Hollywood studio produces something that encourages audiences to question authority, even when that message gets muddled by science fiction trappings, convoluted plots, and special effects. However, having read V for Vendetta several times, while I am willing to overlook some of the cinematic alterations made by the Wachowski brothers (creators ofThe Matrix) as fairly harmless and perhaps even justifiable, there are two points in particular where I believe the film version totally undermines both the literary and political brilliance of the original story.The first point pertains to the portrayal of two of the story's central characters. By demonizing High Chancellor Adam Sutler, who came across as an almost laughable caricature of a raving, frothing-at-the-mouth tyrant, the movie completely robs the story of the psychological complexity found in the book. There, the party leader, Adam Susan, is motivated by an absolute devotion to his country, and an unfaltering conviction that fascism is the only way to save it from destruction. He sacrifices his own freedoms to serve his people (at least the white, straight, Christians among them) and is willing to tolerate dissenters like Inspector Finch as long as they continue to serve the needs of the State (something I could not imagine the hysterical egomaniac played by William Hurt doing). The villains are further vilified by the insertion of a cumbersome and confusing conspiracy plot into the story.SPOILER ALERT!It is eventually revealed that the ruling party orchestrated the nationwide plague that precipitated its rise to power years earlier. It was as if the Wachowskis were afraid their fascist state wouldn't be frightening enough to audiences if it was only responsible for killing civil liberties, so they had to pin the mass murder of 100,000 people on it as well. This changes the party leader from someone--right wing nut job though he may be--who heeds the call of his country in its time of need to pull it from the brink of the abyss, into someone who is motivated solely by the desire for power and a narcissistic need to have the world shaped in his image. This further casts the movie's High Chancellor as the most clich&eacute;d type of cartoonish supervillain. (It also further distances the story from reality and the kind of actual evil usually encountered in the world. Hitler did not have to orchestrate the economic collapse of pre-WWII Germany; he only had to exploit it.)And while the Wachowskis chose to demonize their movie's version of Moore's High Chancellor, they also decided to subtly humanize V. It seems as though they were trying to skew the character to play as more of a hero with audiences by making such changes from the book as narrowing the focus of V's vengeance to the party elite and those who personally wronged him, inventing a conscientious objection to killing their cronies (except when necessary), and having him anguish over his treatment of Evey and breaking down in sobs when she leaves him. Although less offensive to my intelligence than the over the top evil of Adam Sutler, this softening of the book's much more menacing and Machiavellian V nonetheless detracts from the brilliance and uniqueness of Alan Moore's story. The struggle between an all too human villain and a monstrous hero is much more thought-provoking than the black and white morality presented by the movie, which alleviates the audience from any need to question the rightness of V's tactics or feel pity for any of his victims. It is a credit to Alan Moore's writing that readers can still identify with and even like V despite some of his heinous behavior in the book--MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!most notably his torture of Evey, which somehow came across as much more brutal when presented by artist David Lloyd in the graphic novel.Secondly, however disappointed I was with the film adaptation's simplistic depiction of good and evil, what was even more tragic was its total failure to accurately convey the political ideology of its title character. I was horrified when the Old Bailey was blown up in the first 10 minutes of the film, and not just because V had inexplicably forgotten--despite his urging for us all to remember--that the target of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot had been Parliament. Even worse, I realized in that terrible moment that one of my two favorite scenes in the book had just been mercilessly obliterated. V's feigned conversation on the roof of the Old Bailey, in which he explains his reasons behind abandoning Justice for Anarchy, is one of the greatest monologues in graphic literature (despite some of the misogynistic terminology V employs) and makes it clear that V's goals are just as lofty as Adam Susan's (regardless of how one might feel about how either character goes about achieving them). Likewise my other favorite scene, V's address to the British nation via the State's own pirated airwaves, was transformed from a stinging indictment of political apathy and rousing appeal for personal responsibility, into an invocation of some unspecified type of democracy every bit as vague and uninspiring as any real presidential address. The choice presented to the audience of the film seems to be one between democracy and totalitarianism, which for most moviegoers means nothing more than preserving the status quo. In the book, which I consider the most eloquent, moving, and gripping endorsement of anarchism ever written (in comics or anywhere else), V presents readers with ""another way"" that offers ""new life [and] hope reinstated."" In other words, V is offering society as a whole the same sort of transformation Evey underwent (in the book, not the movie), which is nothing less than a completeparadigm shift.The final scene of the movie reminded my wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley's""The Mask Of Anarchy"", except without the sense of exhilaration. It's a shame the movie, unlike the book on which it was based, ultimately failed to evoke the same spirit as the closing lines of this poem:'And these words shall then becomeLike Oppression's thundered doomRinging through each heart and brain,Heard again - again - again -'Rise like Lions after slumberIn unvanquishable number -Shake your chains to earth like dewWhich in sleep had fallen on you -Ye are many - they are few.'",3,Masked Anarchy,1194307200,"11 6, 2007",2007,6923,"['WARNING', 'THIS', 'REVIEW', 'CONTAINS', 'A', 'MAJOR', 'PLOT', 'SPOILER', 'should', 'start', 'admitting',

It's not entirely their fault--the government in the persona of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has put blinders on the British as much as they are too frightened to see what is happening for themselves.Britons' everyday world is very much like George Orwell's ""1984"".  The heavily censored media controls what they see.  Language has morphed to the point where harmless words now carry a serious threat. The Party is all-powerful and can make people disappear without questions.  The countryside is mined with cameras and microphones to detect any protest and the police and military are empowered to eliminate enemies of the state. The Government may well be responsible for the deaths of over a 100,000 of its citizens due to St. Mary's virus.Then one dark November 5th night, Evey Hammond (Portman), a young British woman is walking home and is accosted by men bent on doing her harm.  She's rescued by a black clad figure in a Guy Fawkes mask.He calls himself ""V.""V (Hugo Weaving) offers truth and hope to the British people.  Taking his cue from the Guy Fawkes of history who tried to overthrow the British Government almost 4 centuries prior, V promises that in a year's time, there will be a revolution--the Parliament building will be destroyed and the old government will be overthrown.The film covers the next year's time.  First, the police are attempting to locate V through various means.  Evey parts from V and goes out on her own only to be captured.  And V continues to spread the word to the British people.Every book writer aspires to at least one good line per page.  I cannot say how many that translates to in movies, but ""V"" is beautifully and thoughtfully written.  In addition, the acting on the part of the major characters is good as well.  How Weaving can translate so much character without a facial expression, eludes me.  Natalie Portman's performance as Evey in captivity is also stellar.As I started off, I really regret not having seen this film in full screen.  I understand it's available in IMAX format and I'd love to catch it on that kind of venue.  In particular, the scenes from High Chancellor Sutler would probably be hair raising.Though I have rented this film, it's now on my wish list to add to my collection.

176589,A16QODENBJVUI1,1419838830,Robert Moore,"[15, 23]","Although Alan Moore is regarded as one of the giants of the graphic novel, he has not been well served on film.  FROM HELL was a bit of a disappointment given the talent involved in the project, while THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was simply a horror.  Until last year Moore's fellow great Frank Miller had suffered much the same fate, but 2005 should have seen the release of a great version of Miller's SIN CITY and Moore's V FOR VENDETTA.  But the subway bombings in London made the studio postpone the original November 5 release date until 2006.  Now that there is a great film version of a Moore classic, the big question is whether anyone will be able to do the same thing with the greatest of all graphic novels, Moore's THE WATCHMEN.  I pray that they won't, that they will realize to do a mini-series instead.  It is simply too complex a work not to receive the longer treatment.This is not merely one of the best film versions of a famous graphic novel; it is one of the finest political films of recent years.  The original political context for the novel was Margaret Thatcher's policies and the attitudes surrounding them in the 1980s.  The politics here have been updated somewhat.  Though Thatcher's policies--especially in regard to immigrants and non-whites--struck many as mildly fascist, a host of the policies and actions of George W. Bush and the Religious Right in America have impressed many as even more so.  I don't want to say that the United States is in danger of becoming a fascist state, but I will say that the kind of world envisioned by the Christian Dominionists and Reconstructionists bear startling similarities to the vision of the Nazis, only with God inserted into the center of things instead of the German people (and I write this as a Christian who is frightened by the implications of the political beliefs of some of my brethren).  If V FOR VENDETTA the novel was about the world that Thatcher's England could create if allowed to evolve unchecked, V FOR VENDETTA is a warning of where policies similar to George Bush's could take us.  The parallels are implicit throughout the film, but made explicit in a scene in which Evey is taken into the basement of Stephen Fry's character.  There they see a large poster containing a swastika along with Bush's phrase ""The coalition of the willing,"" a blatant linking of Bush with fascism.  Furthermore, the persecution of homosexuals in the film is intended to recall the Bush administration's playing off the fear and hatred many in the religious right have for gays and lesbians.  And Prothero will remind any viewer of Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh.  And frequent mention is made of the way the fascist government has redefined words, much as the Bush administration has.  All of these elements have been subtly adapted from the novel to make them more relevant to the present situation.  (If you haven't read the novel, I strongly recommend it, but at the very least one should if in a bookstore pick up the book and read Moore's preface, where he expresses dismay over Thatcher.)But what if you like Bush?  Can you enjoy the movie anyway?  I think one can easily watch it and ignore the political context and have the time of one's life.  And thirty years from now people who weren't born when Bush was president would be able to enjoy it without understanding the context.  Alan Moore's mysterious V is one of the most compelling heroes of the past couple of decades, a moral anarchist in William Godwin's original sense.  He begins the film a complete mystery, a man not only without a face but without any apparent context.  The film as a whole is simultaneously constructed as a revenge narrative, as V deliberately destroys the entire system that made his creation possible, and a mystery tale, as Inspector Finch, played wonderfully by Stephen Rea, gradually unravels the cipher that is V.  There are some wonderful action sequences, but they are never allowed to obscure the fact that this is more a movie about ideas.  In many films the main point seems to be the action, with the ideas merely tacked on, but here the ideas are never less than paramount.I liked just about everything about this film.  Hugo Weaving was superb as V.  One of the things I most enjoyed about the Matrix films was listening to Weaving's Agent Smith converse with Neo, not so much what he said as the way he said it.  Because he spends the entire movie behind a mask, here we have to focus entirely on his voice.  Given the mask, it is amazing that he was able to pull it off.  I loved the look of V's outfit.  The design of his costume and map are very faithful to David Lloyd's original artwork.  The cast was very strong.  I've mentioned Weaving and Rea, but for a political fantasy concerning the future a la Orwell, this has a wonderful assemblage of talent, with fine actors like Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggott-Smith, and Rupert Graves.  I very much liked Natalie Portman as Evey.  When I first heard that she was in the film I was mildly alarmed.  She bears little resemblance to Evey in the novel, but my fears were misplaced.  She is such an intelligent actress and this comes out throughout her work.It does depart from the novel at several points, but all in all I thought the adaptation remarkably faithful to the book.  I was disappointed that one bit was left out.  Shortly before he dies, V asks Evey to give him a Viking funeral, and she does, by sending him on the train underneath the parliament buildings.  It would have been easy to include those lines and would have required nothing additional.  I think the film is lesser for lacking those lines.  One could also debate the ending, since in the novel Evey takes on the persona of V, even donning his costume to continue his work.All in all, this is a highly entertaining film that I can urge anyone to watch.  It is one of those rare films that manage to combine both riveting action sequences with political commentary.",5,A brilliant adaptation of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel,1152921600,"07 15,

176605,A32XW50ILWOXNO,1419838830,Samuel McKewon,"[12, 55]","The most creative moments of ""V for Vendetta"" are during its flashy end credits, bathed in red, played over The Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man.""No kidding.The movie is a tremendous artistic letdown. Drab. Pompous. Obvious. So liberal it cannot possibly be considered a sincere allegory, but rather a preach-to-the-choir rant that Michael Moore would appreciate. At least Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" had the juice to stick it to the Bush administration - ""V"" merely wishes it so - and did not cloak its intentions behind an advertising campaign that features star Natalie Portman - who until now was Hollywood's staunchest defender of Israel, the closet thing we've got to a police-state democracy - in roundtables discussing the nature of terrorism.The Wachowski Brothers chose to adapt Alan Moore's graphic novel as their encore to ""The Matrix"" trilogy, inserting the second unit director from those films, James McTigue, as director here. Set 20 years in the future, England has fallen into tyranny, with Hitleresque High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) helming a government that enforces curfews, shapes the news to fit its agenda and employs ""fingermen"" to execute its ultra-conservative rulebook. It's these men that harass Evey Hammond (Portman) in a London back alley one night with the intent of raping her when a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask disarms them, rescues the girl and sweeps her to the rooftop so she can watch him bomb Old Bailey.The man is V (Hugo Weaving), a survivor of government experiments hot for payback and revolution, using the mask of Fawkes - who tried to blow up British Parliament in 1605 - to cover his disfigured face. Theatrical, talky, tortured, brilliant, V is a political Phantom, and London is his Opera House. And shy, observant Evey is the girl he'll come to love. The morning after Old Bailey comes down, V hijacks the state-run TV network and announces he will, in one year, finish what Fawkes started. He invites all of England to come and see.Evey is linked to V, and has no choice but to hide out with him, at least until she can escape. She succeeds, but eventually lands in state prison, where she is tortured to divulge V's whereabouts. If, in fact, she really is in state prison.""V For Vendetta"" is not without its clever twists. Or sincere performances - Portman is especially invested and effective, and Stephen Rea, as a police inspector charged with finding V, pads his resume of taciturn, shambled cops.  The weaknesses are McTigue's boring direction  and the Wachowski Brothers' script in its lack of continuity and tone - the background touches that make movies like ""Blade Runner,"" ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Minority Report"" challenging meditations on the future.We never get a handle on the government, omnipresent in some scenes, absent in others. Considering his past, it's unlikely V would have the access to the unlimited quantities cash needed to execute his Parliament plan, which is straight out of ""Shawshank Redemption"" anyhow. And one can buy only so many moments when a key face looms just out of the spotlight or the second most-wanted terrorist in England can walk around easy breezy because she has a shaved head and a fake ID.The Wachowskis are also too occupied with their liberal markers and props to create an effective argument. V has leather-bound books, art and movie posters in his cave. That means he's wise. A friend of Evey's hides a Koran preserved in glass. That means he's tolerant. The government's symbol is a weird variation on the Christian cross. That means Christianity is twisted.Then there's the Wachowski's agenda of sexual freedom - buried in the subtext of ""The Matrix"" series, but front and center in ""V For Vendetta"" (and previously ""Bound""). A government can violate a thousand rights, and yet the movie chooses as its two testimonials a gay man and a lesbian robbed of their desires. Since the picture never exactly articulates the government's other targets, yet we're certain they exist, we're left with sense that ""V For Vendetta"" places gay rights at the top of its freedom hierarchy, and that tyranny strikes first at gays, and society through them, similar to the Nazis persecution of the Jews.A scarier, tougher movie goes right at the heart of V's thesis statement - ""government should fear its people"" - and examines it through a activist with whom it's not so convenient for the literati to side. Consider America's own twisted V - not the 9/11 terrorists, but Timothy McVeigh, the conservative wing nut who blew up a federal building in response to the FBI's raid on Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. Raised on a rich diet of reciprocity, militarism and hatred, McVeigh nevertheless had an intriguing point to make about the violations of our Second Amendment gun rights. He was a modern Guy Fawkes, he spoke of collateral damage and revolution, and when it came time to line up behind him, we instead put his execution on close-circuit television so the victim's families could watch him die.Just in case you forgot ""V For Vendetta"" was a fantasy.",2,"MBPLN for Murky, Boring, Pompus, Liberal Nonsense",1143244800,"03 25, 2006",2006,5077,"['most', 'creative', 'moments',

176610,A2QAUMR0V33GC9,1419838830,"Scot Carr ""Film and book phanatic""","[5, 11]","""Remember, remember the 5th of November,The Gunpowder Treason and Plot.I know of no reason the Gunpowder TreasonShould ever be forgot.""Comic book geeks on both sides of the Atlantic during the '80s feel chills when we hear that snippet of poetry dedicated to Guy Fawkes.  It's quoted in the beginning of Alan Moore's second seminal comic work, ""V For Vendetta.""  For some reason, the book never seemed to get the dues it deserved, probably because it was ahead of its time when first published serially in ""Warrior"" (U.K.) magazine.  We who lived through those times, even as young people, remember in the U.S. and U.K. there was a feeling of super-patriotism and populism that many of us felt would lead to a new fascism.  Nowadays, those fears ring true again.Purists should take note - especially if you're as (justifiably) persnickety as Alan Moore - that the film takes some liberties with the graphic novel's story.  It's been updated to reflect the new fascist fears of today, as well as the power of television and internet.  Moore was so incensed at the changes made by the Warchowsky Brothers that he fought a successful legal battle to have his credit removed from the movie.  I think I can understand why, as I've seen how Hollywood took his ""Swamp Thing"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and completely warped it from his original intent.  However, I think he would be secretly pleased at how much of the spirit of his story is maintained.The themes of ""V"" are timeless - the use of fear to control and dominate, the willingness of the masses to turn a blind eye to persecuting the ""different"" in order to keep their feeling of security - and McTeague keeps this overall sense of menace and fear by showing us the new Hitler/Stalin, David Sutler (Susan in the graphic novel) mostly on television, just like everyone in that world sees him.  The stark symbolism of the double-bar cross used by the fascist Norsefire Party that brings together the twin tyrannies of repressive State and Organized Religion.  The messages of the film are clear, and well presented.Is it perfect?  No.  Sometimes the pacing lags, and there are sharp changes of mood, such as the parody of Sutler on a chat show set to the tune of what I call the ""Benny Hill Rag"" (those who've watched the Benny Hill Show know what I'm talking about).  Yet the strengths draw you in; the previously mentioned moodiness and feeling of paranoic fear, the superb acting of Natalie Portmann (bonus for maintaining her accent), Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Hugo Weaving (even though it isn't him under the mask most of the time), et. al., and the lush attention to detail in cinematography, as well as stage design.  It all drags you in.There aren't too many action movies out there that also demand that you think and try to draw conclusions.  It's all too easy to end up drowning in metaphor and lectures (which is what happened to the latter two ""Matrix"" outings), yet ""V"" in film form maintains that balance.  We are entertained after all, and called upon to think where we are heading as a people.",4,"The Spirit of ""V"" Is Captured On Film",1157500800,"09 6, 2006",2006,3074,"['Remember', 'remember', '5th', 'November', 'Gunpowder', 'Treason', 'Plot.I', 'know', 'reason', 'Gunpowder', 'TreasonShould', 'ever', 'be', 'forgot', 'Comic', 'book', 'geeks', 'sides', 'Atlantic', ""'80s"", 'feel', 'chills', 'when', 'hear', 'snippet', 'poetry', 'dedicated', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'quoted', 'beginning', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'second', 'seminal', 'comic', 'work', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'reason', 'book', 'never', 'seemed', 'get', 'dues', 'deserved', 'probably', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'when', 'first', 'published', 'serially', 'Warrior', 'U.K.', 'magazine', 'who', 'lived', 'times', 'even', 'young', 'people', 'remember', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'was', 'feeling', 'super-patriotism', 'populism', 'many', 'felt', 'would', 'lead', 'new', 'fascism', 'Nowadays', 'fears', 'ring', 'true', 'again.Purists', 'should', 'take', 'note', 'especially', ""'re"", 'justifiably', 'persnickety', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'film', 'liberties', 'graphic', 'novel', 'story', 'been', 'updated', 'reflect', 'new', 'fascist', 'fears', 'today', 'as', 'well', 'power', 'television', 'internet', 'Moore', 'was', 'so', 'incensed', 'changes', 'made', 'Warchowsky', 'Brothers', 'fought', 'successful', 'legal', 'battle', 'have', 'credit', 'removed', 'movie', 'think', 'can', 'understand', 'why', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'how', 'Hollywood', 'took', 'Swamp', 'Thing', 'League', 'Extraordinary', 'Gentlemen', 'completely', 'warped', 'original', 'intent', 'However', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'secretly', 'pleased', 'how', 'much', 'spirit', 'story', 'maintained.The', 'themes', 'V', 'are', 'timeless', 'use', 'fear', 'control', 'dominate', 'willingness', 'masses', 'turn', 'blind', 'eye', 'persecuting', 'different', 'order', 'keep', 'feeling', 'security', 'McTeague', 'overall', 'sense', 'menace', 'fear', 'showing', 'new', 'Hitler/Stalin', 'David', 'Sutler', 'Susan', 'graphic', 'novel', 'mostly', 'television', 'just', 'everyone', 'world', 'stark', 'symbolism', 'double-bar', 'cross', 'used', 'fascist', 'Norsefire', 'Party', 'together', 'twin', 'tyrannies', 'repressive', 'State', 'Organized', 'Religion', 'messages', 'film', 'are', 'clear', 'well', 'presented.Is', 'perfect', 'Sometimes', 'pacing', 'lags', 'are', 'sharp', 'changes', 'mood', 'such', 'parody', 'Sutler', 'chat', 'show', 'set', 'tune', 'what', 'call', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'Rag', 'who', ""'ve"", 'watched', 'Benny', 'Hill', 'Show', 'know', 'what', ""'m"", 'talking', 'strengths', 'draw', 'previously', 'mentioned', 'moodiness', 'feeling', 'paranoic', 'fear', 'superb', 'acting', 'Natalie', 'Portmann', 'bonus', 'maintaining', 'accent', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'even', ""n't"", 'mask', 'most', 'time', 'et', 'al.', 'lush', 'attention', 'detail', 'cinematography', 'as', 'well', 'stage', 'design', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'many', 'action', 'movies', 'out', 'there', 'also', 'demand', 'think', 'try', 'draw', 'conclusions', 'too', 'easy', 'end', 'up', 'drowning', 'metaphor', 'lectures', 'what', 'happened', 'latter', 'two', 'Matrix', 'outings', 'yet', 'V', 'film', 'form', 'balance', 'are', 'entertained', 'called', 'upon', 'think', 'where', 'are', 'heading', 'people']",N/A

176613,A2PNTEDGMOLMOY,1419838830,Scott Schiefelbein,"[2, 4]","One of the main enjoyments of Alan Moore's graphic novel, ""V for Vendetta,"" was the sense that it was *about* something.  Moore's visceral contempt for mindless conformity was there on every page, and even though his story had many of the standard ""Big Brother"" ideas, there were also several unusual and thought-provoking plot developments and ideas.Much of what made ""V"" such a fantastic graphic novel is absent from this film version, which is presumably why Alan Moore has distanced himself from the movie.  Hugo Weaving is a good choice for the character of V, with his sinister voice and acrobatic body, and Natalie Portman is another good choice as Evey, V's unwilling sidekick and heir apparent.  But these two play their parts in a modified story that is remarkably absent of any emotional heft.The special effects of this movie are astounding, as could be expected from the team that put together the ""Matrix"" movies.  Mega-explosions are handled expertly, as are several other combat and epic-vista scenes.  But special effects are not enough to push ""V"" into the class of great action movies.  ""V"" keeps the viewer at a distance from both V and Evey, even remarkably during Evey's wrenching detention scene.  This scene is the emotional core of the story and brings home the evils of Moore's totalitarian vision, but in this movie it largely feels like a hurried respite between action scenes.For visual appeal, ""V"" is a five-star production from start to finish.  But like ""Van Helsing,"" ""Hulk,"" or the ""Matrix"" sequels, ""V"" cannot be recommended as a great movie (or even a very good one) solely by virtue of its special effects.  At the heart of every great movie - even a great action movie - there must be a great story.  ""V"" takes what makes the graphic novel a special work and truncates it for blockbuster concerns.

A shadowy freedom fighter known only as ""V"" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally. That's all I'm going to go into for plot details.I've never read any of the graphic novels this is based on, so this is a review after a virgin viewing. I love this movie, plain and simple. Hugo Weaving is V and he plays the part amazingly well. Even though V's face is never shown, it doesn't need to be. Weaving uses mannerisms and has such a great voice, that sometimes you forget that it's even a mask. Natalie Portman is wonderful as well as Evey. Both of them have such a great chemistry together and it's always great when they're on screen. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well (John Hurt is amazing as well even though he's not in it all that much).This is not an action movie like the trailers portray it to be (nor is it directed by the Wachowski Brothers as some are lead to believe). It doesn't need to be though. The story, characters and events are so good, that the few action moments in the film (which are spectacular by the way) are so good, you don't need action. It's such an interesting plot too, which I won't get into because you should see it yourself. The action scenes in this are great though, especially at the very end, I got goose bumps. The end sure goes out with a bang too, it's a great great ending to a great great movie.I seriously recommend this movie. It's a very smart movie that puts story over action and characters over flashiness. This truly is an important movie that makes you think, it wants you to think and it does so wonderfully.

176616,A2UYKOS1ZYK1OU,1419838830,"See about me ""firin mah lazar""","[2, 4]","This one will be short. I've never read the original comic this film was apparently based on, but I saw such lavish praise directed at it that I felt compelled to view it anyway. The movie takes place in the near future in England, under the control of a fictitious government. Natalie Portman's character, Evee (is that how it's spelled?) is caught wandering about after curfew by some officers. Just as they were about to go police brutality on her ass, which would have been the best scene in the movie, an enigmatic masked man appears and slays them with his knives. He introduces himself as ""V,"" via pseudo-intellectual jargon, and implores her to join him in an event he promises would be unlike anything she has ever seen. I feel it would be inappropriate for me to ramble on about the plot from this point, so I'll get to the meat and potatoes. V For Vendetta is, of course, is a politically inciting film. It blurs the line between heroism and terrorism, raising some interesting questions that go beyond how we define our words. Unfortunately, some of the political commentary came off as a bit ham-fisted and obvious, if anything. (The highly conservative and religious leader, for instance. Gee whiz, could that be Bill Clinton?) But overall, the message is compelling and its routes stem from how we define our lives, moreso than politics. The film's acting is remarkable for the most part, though Natalie Portman doesn't really impress. The Wachowski brothers had their part in the action scenes I'm aware, and (thankfully) there's no bullet-time or other matrix cliches. The action flows very well.All that aside, V... stands as one of the best sci-fi stories I've seen as of late. Dark yet whimsical, the plot never degenerates into self-parody or a tepid display of CGI, unlike a certain other big sci-fi release. The character V is an achetypical charming aristocratic type, but the stereotype is evidently intended. This is the case for all of the characters, and it never hinders the experience. There are a few dubious coincidences, or perhaps even plot holes, though. Strange V would have a military detainment center in his home, for such a petty purpose as it was used. The entire detainment scene felt a bit convoluted, and the subplot involving the note Evee found in that rathole felt tacked on. But...

It took me awhile to get around to watching this film, but  when I finally saw it on DVD I was quite stunned. How on earth did it ever get made? How did it get past the censors? For V for Vendetta is like an anarchist manifesto! I know it was loosely based on a controversial English graphic novel; and that its creators didn't like this film version much at all, although I don't really know why. The Wachowski's should be congratulated for bringing this timely film to the silver screen as I think it is most relevant in todays climate of increasing religious fundamentalism, extremism and intolerance. The film is set in a bleakly dystopian UK of the near future whose populace lives in constant fear of the oppressive Christo-Fascist dictatorship called Norsefire (based on the National Front) run by a demented Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) who though reclusive, rules with an iron fist. The regime deports so called foreigners, black bags intellectuals, artists, sexual minorities and anyone who presumably steps out of line. The story of the film follows one Evey Hammond (Natalie  Portman) who is out late one night and is accosted by some secret policemen called ""fingermen"" who intend to rape her. She is saved at the last moment by a mysterious masked vigilante named V (Hugo Weaving) who takes her to his lair... but only after blowing up the Old Bailey first!V is the tortured and obsessive antihero of the film that over time opens up Evey's mind to the horrors that are going on around her unquestioned and unchallenged by anyone, and this is where the story really begins. V has a personal grudge against the Norsefire regime and he is the only one brave enough to stand up to them; and certainly does so with great panache, style and flair! V is a freedom fighter, and not a terrorist like some have claimed, for he is primarily fighting for the rights of the downtrodden people and not some twisted and reactionary political or religious dogma. Throughout the movie V and Evey are under investigation by the police, and it's a race against time for him to accomplish his goal of toppling the corrupt Norsefire regime. One of the chief reasons I appreciate this film is for its compassionately positive portrayal of its gay and lesbian characters; for I think that many fundamentalist leaders today (of most religious persuasions) would truly love to marginalize, persecute and vilify sexual and gender minorities in the same way that Norsefire does, though only if they got their way of course.V for Vendetta the film may not be as good as the graphic novel, but then, film versions of books rarely are. Doubtless Hollywood has filtered out some of the more explicit political and drug references, but the anarchist message still comes across loud and clear. So if I were the author I wouldn't be too upset for sales of the original graphic novel have gone up, and most importantly, people are slowly becoming more politically aware and socially conscious. This is an important movie that openly questions where Western culture is heading; the christian right is gaining power, the separation of church and state is constantly being challenged, many of our basic democratic freedoms and civil liberties are being eroded and big business is creating a bland intellectual, cultural and ecological wasteland. So if humanity doesn't start to grow up as soon as possible, then I fear the world we live in has no future.

All in all it is rather engaging and enjoyable to watch... if you are so inclined, then you will probably think about it for a little bit (and perhaps read up on Old Bailey).The plot concerns a literally faceless, mysterious man who dons the mask of old school anarchist Guy Faulkes. He, his name is V, goes around and blows up building and kills coppers. He also meets a girl. She is rather smashing. Apparently the actress also played a princess in the Star Wars movies (of course, here she wears much less make-up). The government wants to stop him because they think that they are right. Maybe they are? Maybe they are not? Who is to tell anyway?Remember those guys that made The Matrix, well it was the same folks as made this nice little movie. As always, their movies are greatly concerned with seemingly pleasent societies that turn out to by dystopic in reality. Also, their movies are drenched in philosophical discourse. Just as the Matrix concerned itself with causality and whatever else, this movie concerns itself with the dichotomies present betwixt deontology and teleology. For those out there who are unfamiliar with the said terminology, look it up, eh... Regardless, this movie does not necessarilly feed you the answers to these questions, because it is quite possible that there are no answers to them. Apparently the comics are more morally ambiguous, but the moral ambiguity here was quite enough for me.All in all, this was certainly a movie worth seeing. It killed off 2 hours of my day and I am not sad at all. In fact I am happy. I was able to escape to a world more miserable than my own.

It was made at a time when most other media channels had been successfully censored and controlled by Corporate Big Brother (as they still are to a large degree), while a united cabal of Corporate and billionaire power dragged the United States to the precipice of fascism.  Movies were one of the few ways to get a democratic message across.  The success of the Wachowski brothers gave them a freedom of expression that few others in the media had, a freedom protected by their uncanny ability to make scads of money when left to their own creative devices.  The fear of killing the goose that laid the Golden Egg trumped the fear of freedom of expression.""V"" builds on the concept created in ""The Matrix"", by far the greatest movie of the Matrix Trilogy: the notion of a totalitarian regime that exerts its control over the masses in part by carefully crafted and controlled reality creation, and then goes much further.  Unlike the Matrix, V clearly establishes connections to real life events and persons, both actual and projected, such as when it portrays the United States as having descended into anarchy as blowback for its initiation of illegal wars of aggression (deemed illegal by the ""quaint"" Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg trials), complete with demonstrations with protest signs expressly identifying then-president Bush.  Right wing corporate propagandists are accurately symbolized by a composite character (Dominic) that is an irritating amalgam of Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly, and similar right wing corporate mouthpieces from England.  Second-in-Command ""Creepy"" Creedy is an inspired interpretation/extrapolation of America's then Second (?)-in-Command vice president Dick Cheney.  John Hurt comes full-circle from victim of totalitarianism in the movie ""1984"" to totalitarian victimizer in ""V"" as the inspired choice as a prophetic tie-in to George Orwell's ""1984"", complete with numerous spot-on allusionary warnings left to be identified by the viewer.  Hurt's character unites, leads, coerces, and bullies the futuristic right wing regime into a cohesive controlling unit of Fascist England with England being symbolic of the West in general, while simultaneously dealing with the opposition as brutally as possible to thwart the will to resist.Although one could surmise from the movie's title that the hero, ""V"", utilizes his more-likely-than-comic-book-usual superpowers to become yet another avenger of the many wrongs perpetrated by Evil, a usually accurate conclusion that can nevertheless be quite entertaining, but quite wrong in this case.  For while V has some very impressive abilities attributed to nerve damage caused by his being the subject of biotoxic experimentation, he is merely the (barely) human vessel containing the means by which those held captive by fascism are freed.  V is the repository and transmitter of ideas, and it is ultimately those ideas which are the Hero of the movie, a very unusual cinematic proposition indeed.  And isn't that often a key component of great movies: unusual cinematic propositions?PS  For more enlightenment as to how this whole scenario will play out, read the Pulitzer Prize Winning ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", by William Shirer, from which a startling number of similarities to modern events can readily been seen, and watch the great movie ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" to see what generally lay in store for the surviving perpetrators.",5,The Greatest Movie Ever Made?,1377648000,"08 28, 2013",2013,3616,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'candidate', 'overused', 'imaginary', 'award', 'category', 'greatest', 'movie', 'ever', 'made', 'simply', 'greatest', 'movie', 'prescient', 'time', 'was', 'made', 'time', 'when', 'most', 'other', 'media', 'channels', 'had', 'been', 'successfully', 'censored', 'controlled', 'Corporate', 'Big', 'Brother', 'still', 'are', 'large', 'degree', 'united', 'cabal', 'Corporate', 'billionaire', 'power', 'dragged', 'United', 'States', 'precipice', 'fascism', 'Movies', 'were', 'one', 'few', 'ways', 'get', 'democratic', 'message', 'success', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'gave', 'freedom', 'expression', 'few', 'others', 'media', 'had', 'freedom', 'protected', 'uncanny', 'ability', 'make', 'scads', 'money', 'when', 'left', 'own', 'creative', 'devices', 'fear', 'killing', 'goose', 'laid', 'Golden', 'Egg', 'trumped', 'fear', 'freedom', 'expression', 'V', 'builds', 'concept', 'created', 'Matrix', 'far', 'greatest', 'movie', 'Matrix', 'Trilogy', 'notion', 'totalitarian', 'regime', 'control', 'masses', 'part', 'carefully', 'crafted', 'controlled', 'reality', 'creation', 'then', 'much', 'further', 'Matrix', 'V', 'clearly', 'connections', 'real', 'life', 'events', 'persons', 'actual', 'projected', 'such', 'when', 'United', 'States', 'having', 'descended', 'anarchy', 'blowback', 'initiation', 'illegal', 'wars', 'aggression', 'deemed', 'illegal', 'quaint', 'Geneva', 'Conventions', 'Nuremberg', 'trials', 'complete', 'demonstrations', 'protest', 'signs', 'expressly', 'identifying', 'then-president', 'Bush', 'Right', 'wing', 'corporate', 'propagandists', 'are', 'accurately', 'symbolized', 'composite', 'character', 'Dominic', 'irritating', 'amalgam', 'Glenn', 'Beck', 'Rush', 'Limbaugh', 'Bill', ""O'Reilly"", 'similar', 'right', 'wing', 'corporate', 'mouthpieces', 'England', 'Second-in-Command', 'Creepy', 'Creedy', 'inspired', 'interpretation/extrapolation', 'America', 'then', 'Second', '-in-Command', 'vice', 'president', 'Dick', 'Cheney', 'John', 'Hurt', 'full-circle', 'victim', 'totalitarianism', 'movie', '1984', 'totalitarian', 'victimizer', 'V', 'inspired', 'choice', 'prophetic', 'tie-in', 'George', 'Orwell', '1984', 'complete', 'numerous', 'spot-on', 'allusionary', 'warnings', 'left', 'be', 'identified', 'viewer', 'Hurt', 'character', 'unites', 'leads', 'coerces', 'futuristic', 'right', 'wing', 'regime', 'cohesive', 'controlling', 'unit', 'Fascist', 'England', 'England', 'being', 'symbolic', 'West', 'general', 'simultaneously', 'dealing', 'opposition', 'as', 'brutally', 'possible', 'thwart', 'will', 'resist.Although', 'one', 'could', 'surmise', 'movie', 'title', 'hero', 'V', 'more-likely-than-comic-book-usual', 'superpowers', 'become', 'yet', 'avenger', 'many', 'wrongs', 'perpetrated', 'Evil', 'usually', 'accurate', 'conclusion', 'can', 'nevertheless', 'be', 'quite', 'entertaining', 'quite', 'wrong', 'case', 'V', 'very', 'impressive', 'abilities', 'attributed', 'nerve', 'damage', 'caused', 'being', 'subject', 'biotoxic', 'experimentation', 'merely', 'barely', 'human', 'vessel', 'containing', 'means', 'held', 'captive', 'fascism', 'are', 'freed', 'V', 'repository', 'transmitter', 'ideas', 'ultimately', 'ideas', 'are', 'Hero', 'movie', 'very', 'unusual', 'cinematic', 'proposition', 'indeed', ""n't"", 'that', 'often', 'key', 'component', 'great', 'movies', 'unusual', 'cinematic', 'propositions', 'PS', 'more', 'enlightenment', 'how', 'whole', 'scenario', 'will', 'play', 'out', 'read', 'Pulitzer', 'Prize', 'Winning', 'Rise', 'Fall', 'Third', 'Reich', 'William', 'Shirer', 'startling', 'number', 'similarities', 'modern', 'events', 'can', 'readily', 'been', 'seen', 'watch', 'great', 'movie', 'Judgment', 'Nuremberg', 'see', 'what', 'generally', 'lay', 'store', 'surviving', 'perpetrators']",N/A

To such dimwitted lemmings, thank you for substantiating the need for this film.As for the film itself, it was, simply put, a work of sheer brilliance. Not as much a tool for ""the left"", as some automatons would have you believe, as it is a necessary statement on the manner in which political leaders, past and present, gain power and profit by imposing fear on society. Sound eerily familiar given today's abhorrent disgraces? If so, your mind is open. If not, your head is buried safely in the sand.Natalie Portman and ugo Weaving provide powerful performances in roles in which lesser actors would be inclined to overract. Subtlety in performance can go a long way toward allowing a film to get its message across and the aforementioned executed their roles flawlessly in this manner.I won't provide spoilers, but there are (many) scenes worth noting in this film, including the ""V""-laden preamble given by V upon meeting Evey, the sequences involving the imprisoned Evey, the scenes which detailed the events at Lark Hill, including the origin of his name, and on and on and on. This film was great on so many levels that its ""payoff"" exists throughout the film, and not just during its incredible climax.For those who were put off by some of the Matrix's (another fine film) relatively disjointed, often esoteric sequences, V for Vendetta may prove refreshing in the fact that it provides more explicit explanations of its underlying meanings and origins as it moves along through the story. As such, the ""Ahas"" come more rapidly to the viewer, thereby allowing the viewer to focus more on the events as they unfold rather than focusing on what transpired eariler in the film.In sum, this was a film with a message, indeed, and that message was expertly crafted by two of the most brilliant filmakers in the game today. For those who can't seem to remove their political blinders before watching a film, I would suggest something more along the lines of a pro-war propaganda film from the 1940s.

176645,AGMW3I34INNYG,1419838830,Stephen Cannon,"[4, 8]","V For Vendetta is a rare sort of film.  It does qualify as an action movie, but at its core are some real-world issues that are sort of timeless.  Natalie Portman stars as Evey Hammond, a girl with an interesting past whose life is saved by a masked stranger named V (Hugo Weaving).  V is a lterate, mysterious anti-hero who enjoys alliterating, but does not think twice about doing what he deems necessary.  Some would say he is a terrorist, which is sort of true.  But like all terrorists he believes in his cause, and will risk anything to see it through.  V takes Evey in, and begins his plan to collapse the dictatorial government if a future London, lorded over by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  The events that follow are very dramatic, and as we learn the stories of V, Evey, and others, there seems to be a connection in how certain events changed their lives.Directed by James McTeigue, his first effort as such, V is an impressive film.  The pacing works well, buidling to an effective conclusion.  The film is not perfect - what movie is? - but it's easily the best film I have seen this year.  Don't be deceived - this is a drama with action, much more so than the matrix films, to which V has drawn many comparisons.  If you are able, catch it in IMAX to punch up the action scenes(not that they need it!).A final note - this movie has been accused of attacking the bush administration and the war in Iraq.  Please understand that this is based on a comic book story written in 1982 railing against Margaret Thatcher's London of that time, and is only one perspective that can be applied to most government structures.  Don't take it too seriously!  Final grade: A+",5,"V for Vivid, Voracious, Violent, and...

176646,A21XDUIO2A4B8J,1419838830,Stephen Paul Ives-Butterfield,"[1, 4]","PILOJ is the acronymn for ""Proscription In Lieu Of Justice"". Proscription means banishment. And, here, in ""V For Vendetta"", where govt killing is to be avenged, and where justice is impossible, V's penalty for banishment is death.Until justice is done... We are, of course, in the twisty-turny world of justifying vigilante killings. When a govt does not protect citizens from murder, when a govt is instead responsible for the murder of its citizens; when a govt does not protect citizen rights, when a govt instead violates its citizen rights; when a govt's representatives act as though they live above the law and do not obey the Constitution, then justice must be considered to be impossible.  And, the vigilante may properly contend, if those conditions hold, then that govt's claim to the consent of its citizens is forfeit, and that govt is illegitimate until justice is done.When authorities have made justice impossible, when they've wired down a society's pressure cooker's safety valve--stopping all possibility of change--and then have cranked up the heat by continually disobeying the Constitution, there's only one result to be sanely expected.Americans are there, doing that.  Stories such as ""V For Vendetta"" give us a basis for discussion, a point of departure for speculation.Vigilante killings, in some pure sense, are wrongful murders.  You cannot take the law into your own hands when you live under the rule of law.  If you do, then you must expect to pay the piper.However--no matter how genuine the rule of law seems to be at the time--every era has many persons who think they live above the law, as well as many persons who live outside the law.  Such persons can always arrange circumstances in which their killings--their wrongful taking of lives--makes justice impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain.  It's the way of the world and has been since the earliest codifications of law.  Well--with the sole exception of Switzerland, the only nation in which democracy is directly in the hands of the people at all jurisdictional levels.If we, as ordinary citizens, with no ability to make justice happen under our govt, banish a wrong-doer and his/her helpers from our society, we can choose any penalty for the banishment that we choose.  If the person is clearly guilty of robbery, not murder, we may penalize him/her by taking wealth--money and property.  If the person is clearly guilty of wrongfully taking lives, then killing that person and his/her helper(s) is arguably justifiable.And so, into the twisty-turny world of vigilante killings.The fictional man called ""V"" lives under a totalitarian govt that has proven itself to him to be guilty of many murders.  It's a fascist govt very similar to Hitler's Germany, the infamous 3rd Reich.  Under such govts, ordinary people cannot make justice happen.After his near-thing escape from a research center--in which a lethal virus and its cure were developed, killing dozens--V watches as the politician-killers take many tens of thousands of lives with their own cureable virus.  He then prepares himself for about twenty years, and then jumps up his campaign to topple the totalitarian govt.He blows things up and kills as needed to keep himself free.  Under the cloak of state-controlled news media, he kills men and women whom he knows are directly guilty of wrongful death.  He also kills their helpers, for example, policemen. Ultimately, he cuts down the criminal govt's topmost leaders.Killing helpers is a bit of a stretch legally, but those who aid others in wrongful killing are themselves part of the ""felony murder"" conspiracy.  So V's killing of the regime's policemen--as with Robin Hood's killing of ""the Sheriff's men"" in the late 12th Century--is arguably the killing of those guilty of conspiratorial felony murder and therefore arguably justifiable.You don't step very far away from Robin Hood in any dealings with vigilante justice.  The History Channel's priceless documentary, ""The Real Robin Hood"", should be on the viewing list for anyone chewing on vigilante justice.  Sure, it's probably a grautuitous hype for the Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe movie, ""Robin Hood"".  But it's the outlaw's backstory, no matter how far in the future the outlaw runs with his vigilante justice.  Surprisingly, Crowe's touchstone of Robin Hood's taking rights and liberties from the rich and giving those to the poor so that justice can be done is ""spot on"", as the Brits say, for today's needs.In any event, the key here is that V's killings are punishment for murders done by a govt that protects itself and its cronnies and under which justice is impossible.  V's unsurprising intention is to take that liberty-set from the rich and powerful and then to give it to the poor and ordinary citizens.  Hello, justice.  Hello, Crowe and Scott.  Hello, Robin Hood.That govt's self-protectiveness and illegal caring for its rich and powerful cronnies is, in fact, very similar to the US govt since the Reagan administrations in the 1980s.  (See especially, ""Inside Job"", the 2011 Oscar-winning Best Documentary of the Year, which covers the causes of the 2008 financial meltdown.)  The similarity of govts is what makes the movie, ""V For Vendetta"", an important topic of discussion and point of departure for ordinary Americans.The movie is done in a ""filmatic graphic novel"" syle, according to the filmmakers themselves.  I didn't notice any filmatic nod to the graphic novel until V's final fight, you know, when he brings his daggers to a gunfight.  Then the filmatic comic book effects fairly jump off the screen at you.  The spun and hurled daggers are given the same visual after-images that you expect to see on a comic book's pages.  Yes, it's CGI to die for.The film's story is based on a ten-issue comic book series and given the ""graphic novel"" upgrade tag.  It's writers, and certainly the adaptive filmmakers, want it to be seen as something more than comic book logic.I'm not sure that the story makes it to that next level.  The story has many twists and turns that smack of disjointed, disconnected comic book logic.  Still, the story seems more engaging than something out of the straight, superhero, comic book genre.Some of the film's core features are things that our today's revolutionaries need to digest.  Given the belief of enough people, V says, a symbol--say the blowing up of a building--can change the world.  When V's bomb blows up the buildings of Parliament at the end--punctuated by a great sprong from the airborne Big Ben clock--the implication is that he's successfully involved enough people to bring down the V-decaptivated govt.Revolutionaries, make a note.  Rule one is seeing democracy done.  It's doers must be seen by its other doers--directly and beyond the reach of the sniveling superrich or their parasitic politicians.  All the great democracy movements share this seeing.  In the end, V-the-filmatic-graphic-novel shows the needed seeing of democracy done.--spib, 23 Dec 2011",5,V For Vendetta--pure vigilante PILOJ,1324598400,"12 23, 2011",2011,7013,"['PILOJ', 'acronymn',

Hugo Weaving plays V, the masked avenger to whom an obtrusive failed coup 400 years ago on November 5th plays apocalyptic importance. Natalie Portman co-stars as Evey, an innocent bystander who becomes entangled in V's plan and ultimately finds  herself in love with him (even though he nearly tortures her to death in one of the odd subplots that just doesn't work).The movie is filmed with earnestness and vision, blending flawless special effects with a thought-provoking story about freedom, vengeance, the role of government, the importance of individuality, and the quest for truth despite the consequences. However, rather than rise to the occasion, the Wachowski brothers take a detour into using the movie to make social statements that seem to be added not because they are organic to the story, but because they are important to the filmmakers:* Those who believe in God are cruel, repressive, homophobic and hypocritical. This caricature becomes so overbearing you eventually think you're watching a propaganda film rather than an action-adventure.* The ends justify the means for individuals but not for governments.* Vengeance, including terrorism and mass murder, is acceptable as long as you were disfigured years ago at a top-secret government facility.* Mercy and forgiveness are weaker moral responses to injustice than murder, torture and revenge are.In the end, the movie is a letdown as it becomes encumbered with trying to make a point rather than tell a story and viewers are left feeling like they're supposed to be cheering for a victory that seems like a defeat.

The main plot is about the revolution to overthrow the fascist government, which succeeds. This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government. Evey's arc is also accompanied by her growing love for V.The story ends with society taking up V's call to arms and marching on parliament to overthrow the government.The movie has numerous references to Nazi Germany and tries to make a point that revenge for its own sake is not the end goal, rather, overcoming fear to stand up for what's right is paramount. This is highlighted by the ending whereby V does not blow up the parliament on his own but leaves it to the people.It's a great idea.But the movie didn't work for me. Mostly because the beginning raised the stakes so much that the turning points leading to the end felt inconsequential or unbelievable. We go from the first 10 minutes where:Evey goes on a date past curfew, whereby she is:Harassed by the police with threat of rape, whereby:V saves her by beating the police up, V goes onto blow up the courtsFrom there, the movie gets to work to lay out each of the plots. The problem for me is the first 10 minutes setup a world where hyperbole rules.

There is a fire, and the resettlement camp burns to the ground. One inmate survives, our hero V, who appears to have taken his name from his cell door, which bears the Roman numeral for five, which is ""V"". He now has a vendetta to kill all the high ranking officials that orchestrated the prison and the experiments on the inmates.The government does create a biological weapon from the program, but instead of using it on the enemy they unleash it on their own citizens to create panic, so that they can have more laws and enforcers.Due to the fire, V is horribly scared, and dons a Guy Fawkes costume including mask, wig and cape. It's creepy but powerful. Guy Fawkes was also a revolutionary who tried, unsuccessfully, to blow up parliament. Guy Fawkes day, November 5th, is a theme throughout the movie.V meets our heroine, Evey when he saves her from an evil curfew enforcer. Her life is never the same.He hijacks a TV station, and gives one of the most moving speeches I've ever heard. His theme is the government should be afraid of it's people, the people shouldn't be afraid of the government. He succeeds in blowing up a building and killing everyone on his list. The government then makes up stories to cover up his actions. He does some really bad things, even to Evey. But in the end, he has an impact on the whole country, as they finally stand up in mass against the government.It is an excellent and powerful movie that reminds us that we must fight to keep our freedoms because the government does not always have our best interest in mind, and what they tell us isn't always the truth.",5,Absolute power corrupts absolutely,1198108800,"12 20, 2007",2007,1805,"['story', 'set', 'London', 'where', 'evil', 'chancellor', 'head', 'oppressive', 'government', 'up', 'anyone', 'different', 'guinea', 'pigs', 'biological', 'warfare', 'experiments', 'fire', 'resettlement', 'camp', 'burns', 'ground', 'One', 'inmate', 'hero', 'V', 'who', 'have', 'taken', 'name', 'cell', 'door', 'Roman', 'numeral', 'five', 'V', 'now', 'vendetta', 'kill', 'high', 'ranking', 'officials', 'orchestrated', 'prison', 'experiments', 'inmates.The', 'government', 'create', 'biological', 'weapon', 'program', 'instead', 'using', 'enemy', 'unleash', 'own', 'citizens', 'create', 'panic', 'can', 'have', 'more', 'laws', 'enforcers.Due', 'fire', 'V', 'horribly', 'scared', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'costume', 'including', 'mask', 'wig', 'cape', 'creepy', 'powerful', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'was', 'also', 'revolutionary', 'who', 'tried', 'unsuccessfully', 'blow', 'up', 'parliament', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'day', 'November', '5th', 'theme', 'movie.V', 'heroine', 'Evey', 'when', 'evil', 'curfew', 'enforcer', 'life', 'never', 'same.He', 'TV', 'station', 'one', 'most', 'moving', 'speeches', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'heard', 'theme', 'government', 'should', 'be', 'afraid', 'people', 'people', 'should', ""n't"", 'be', 'afraid', 'government', 'blowing', 'up', 'building', 'killing', 'everyone', 'list', 'government', 'then', 'up', 'stories', 'cover', 'up', 'actions', 'really', 'bad', 'things', 'even', 'Evey', 'end', 'impact', 'whole', 'country', 'finally', 'stand', 'up', 'mass', 'government.It', 'excellent', 'powerful', 'movie', 'must', 'fight', 'keep', 'freedoms', 'government', 'not', 'always', 'have', 'best', 'interest', 'mind', 'what', 'tell', ""n't"", 'always', 'truth']",N/A
176667,A268EEWUXYCA8Q,1419838830,Terry Mesnard,"[7, 10]","I knew I would love this movie the moment we first see V and he begins spouting lines in alliteration.  That cue right there let me know this wasn't going to be the average action film.  Of course, with all of the hoopla and news about this movie and its controversy, I never once truly thought it would be the average action film.In fact, to call it an action film is misleading.  It has more in line with political thrillers than other action films.  There are a couple central mysteries that the plot wraps itself around.  Each of these mysteries are investigated through various means including Stephen Rea as a detective brave enough to follow the trails.  Speaking of the cast, it is quite formidable.  V is, of course, played by Hugo Weaving who not many know off hand but will remember him as either Agent Smith or Elrond the elf.  Natalie Portman plays Evey.  In a terrific and ironic twist, London's dictator is played by John Hurt who starred in 1984, a film V for Vendetta has a lot in common with.V for Vendetta is about London in 2020, a time not very far removed from us, but utterly alien.  The United States has fallen from the power-country and Britain has reigned its head in a dictatorship way.  Sutler, the dictator in question, uses footage from around the world (some true some not) in order to subdue his citizens.  Citizens are told of the horrors in far off lands, the attrocities being committed.  And then is told that this ""uber-protection"" he utilizes is for his citizens best.  ""See?  We don't have these problems here in London.""  True.  But the problems there are, arguably, worse.V also owes a debt of gratitude to Guy Fawkes, the anti-hero who, in 1605, tried to blow up Parliament because of their laws that didn't given Catholics the same rights as the Angelicans.  In other words, the freedom to act and live as they deserved.  In 2020, 400 years after this event, the day has been all but forgotten and the citizens live in blissful ignorance that they have given up all their rights.What the film makers have done, though, is give us an interesting protagonist in V.  Is he mad?  Is he genius?  Is he right?  Wrong?  None of these questions are directly and the film makers leave the audience with more questions than answers as to what to think of this film.  People are drawing connections to current day situations.  I don't think this is unfounded, but instead of using the film to make a critique of our current culture, I believe they are doing something more interesting.  The London in this movie got to the way they were due to apathy and fear and allowing their government to usurp any rights and freedoms they have.  As free citizens, this movie instead evokes us and pleads with us to not let us get to that situation.  A situation in which it takes a 'terrorist' to knock some sense into the government and its people.A must see.",5,"Remember, remember the fifth of November",1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,2882,"['knew', 'would', 'love', 'movie', 'moment', 'first', 'see', 'V', 'spouting', 'lines', 'alliteration', 'cue', 'right', 'let', 'know', 'was', ""n't"", 'going', 'be', 'average', 'action', 'film', 'course', 'hoopla', 'news', 'movie', 'controversy', 'never', 'once', 'truly', 'thought', 'would', 'be', 'average', 'action', 'film.In', 'fact', 'call', 'action', 'film', 'misleading', 'more', 'line', 'political', 'thrillers', 'other', 'action', 'films', 'are', 'couple', 'central', 'mysteries', 'plot', 'around', 'mysteries', 'are', 'investigated', 'various', 'means', 'including', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'detective', 'brave', 'enough', 'follow', 'trails', 'Speaking', 'cast', 'quite', 'formidable', 'V', 'course', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'who', 'not', 'many', 'know', 'off', 'hand', 'will', 'remember', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'Elrond', 'elf', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Evey', 'terrific', 'ironic', 'twist', 'London', 'dictator', 'played', 'John', 'Hurt', 'who', 'starred', '1984', 'film', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'lot', 'common', 'with.V', 'Vendetta', 'London', '2020', 'time', 'not', 'very', 'far', 'removed', 'utterly', 'alien', 'United', 'States', 'fallen', 'power-country', 'Britain', 'reigned', 'head', 'dictatorship', 'way', 'Sutler', 'dictator', 'question', 'footage', 'world', 'true', 'not', 'order', 'subdue', 'citizens', 'Citizens', 'are', 'told', 'horrors', 'far', 'lands', 'attrocities', 'being', 'committed', 'then', 'told', 'uber-protection', 'citizens', 'best', 'See', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'problems', 'here', 'London', 'True', 'problems', 'are', 'arguably', 'worse.V', 'also', 'debt', 'gratitude', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'anti-hero', 'who', '1605', 'tried', 'blow', 'up', 'Parliament', 'laws', 'did', ""n't"", 'given', 'Catholics', 'same', 'rights', 'Angelicans', 'other', 'words', 'freedom', 'act', 'live', 'deserved', '2020', '400', 'years', 'event', 'day', 'been', 'forgotten', 'citizens', 'live', 'blissful', 'ignorance', 'have', 'given', 'up', 'rights.What', 'film', 'makers', 'have', 'done', 'give', 'interesting', 'protagonist', 'V.', 'mad', 'genius', 'right', 'Wrong', 'None', 'questions', 'are', 'directly', 'film', 'makers', 'leave', 'audience', 'more', 'questions', 'answers', 'what', 'think', 'film', 'People', 'are', 'drawing', 'connections', 'current', 'day', 'situations', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'unfounded', 'instead', 'using', 'film', 'make', 'critique', 'current', 'culture', 'believe', 'are', 'doing', 'something', 'more', 'interesting', 'London', 'movie', 'got', 'way', 'were', 'due', 'apathy', 'fear', 'allowing', 'government', 'usurp', 'rights', 'freedoms', 'have', 'free', 'citizens', 'movie', 'instead', 'pleads', 'not', 'let', 'get', 'situation', 'situation', ""'terrorist"", 'knock', 'sense', 'government', 'people.A', 'must', 'see']",N/A

176669,AMLV3B3JDF4HD,1419838830,The Kite,"[13, 35]","Original, thought-provoking and daring were just some of the words from other viewers that lured me into seeing this self-adoring film.So lets explore these ideas(and, in keeping with the movie, you can hate ME for this review but my IDEAS are bullet-proof!!!Muwahaha!).....1) OriginalPAlease. Granted, the first twenty minutes I got kinda excited, hoping to see a clever script full of witty alliterations and matrix-like fight scenes but, looooooooong siiiiiiiiiiigh, I was greatly deceived. I conitinued to watch in dismay as the plot frolicked into the land of  I'm Trying So Hard Not To But I'm Just Like Every Other Film and the script happily  meandered into Chock-Full of Cliches and Loving It region. There's a violent murderer who really has a heart of gold and he wears a mask because he's scarred but holds beauty beyond the physical. He happens to be in the area to rescue a girl who happens to be beautiful and happens to work for the TV station he commandeers and happens to have a past full of rebellion. Yaaaaawn. Good thing no one believes in coincedence or else it would have been REALLY cheesy(winkwink). Of course we also have villians with 0 depth, corrupt clergy and politicians, oppressed minorities and a people rallying, sacrifical, bloody, huge explosion filled, staggering-to-the-one-you-love-just-to-be-able-to-utter-the-perfect-last-words ending. Are you asleep yet?Original? A+ for effort, F for execution.2) Thought ProvokingFirst, I will admit that V had several lines that made me smile or ponder a moment. But after his ridiculous usage of torture - the very thing that embittered him into his mission!!! - he rather lost all credibility to me. While V loathes the murderous society he lives in who kills people they don't approve of, he pracitces the same thing, killing those he doesn't approve of. He is different from them only in his opinion of what is right and wrong. He still enforces it in the same way they do - brute force. Its this character that the movie asks you to root for and beleive in... I just didn't buy it, but obviously, judging from its top of the box office 26.1million dollar opening, most everybody else did.Thought Provoking? Provoked me to just enough thought to write this review and then banish it from my mind forever.3) DaringSo it ""dared"" to ask the questions, ""What if another moraly fanatic control freak Hitler-type took over the world?""  and ""What if we were in a supremely controlled world where our every move was monitored by the government?"" I would say ""daring"" would mean if its a topic movie makers shy away from. Hardly. Just to name a few: The Manchurian Candidate, Gattaca, A.I., The Final Cut, Minority Report and of course, the Matrix Trilogy all explore this idea.Also, the whole thing was blown so out of proportion that it succeeded in paralleling no one. It was far too extreme to be daring. It took some things conservatives believe and blew it up so much that only a handful of people could actually relate. It pretended to be ""in your face"" with the truth but, honestly, no one seemed to take it personally but simply nodded thinking it was addressing ""someone else"". This is called the SECRET SAFE ROUTE - make yourself look like you're willing to say anything while offended a maximum of 1% of the population.Daring? Close but no cigar.Ok, so the total of the above is a big whopping F. However, there were a couple things that inched it up to a C- on my scale.1) Natalie Portman = lovely and believable performance, especially toward the beginning of the film. I think she will be one of those stars that just goes on forever, impressing if not a little shy of stunning us with her beautiful acting skills.2) The cinematoghrapy, costumes and setting = The usage of color in this movie is very nice. We have a dark feel overall, spotted with some reds and whites and just when it gets too dreary(for example, in Evey's cell), we get splashes of yellow and green(Valerie's story). All the outfits and colors fit the characters, although the Hitler-type motif was a little over the top. The city was appealingly clean and tidy yet chilling and lonely. The first blowing up of the building was unexpected eye-candy and Natalie's wardrobe stayed subtle, like her character.I don't mind so much if someone likes this movie(my boyfriend and my sister seem to enjoy it just fine) as long as you don't insult my intelligence by telling me its original, thought-provoking or daring.So, my View is that I am the Victim of this Valient effort, which Veered into Vanity and Verbosness, concluding with Virtually no Value.In short, V adored itself enough that none of us need to waste the effort.",2,V for Very stupid,1159228800,"09 26,

176671,APRZ2IVM8JTLV,1419838830,The Mysterious Traveler,"[0, 3]","V FOR VENDETTA(2006) Created by the Wachowski Brothers. Based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore. Starring Natalie Portman, John Hurt and Hugo Weaving.Set in the not too far future, England is controlled by a Christian Conservative vaguely Nazi/fascist goverment that achieved power by staging a fake terrorist attack by supposedly Moslem Extremists. The current govt persecutes Moslems, Gays and liberals while forcing the people to watch what is supposed to be Fox News. Luckily a masked super powered Terrorist/freedom fighter dressed like Guy Fawkes begins blowing up famous landmark buildings and training the populace to give up their individuality and rise up against the govt while assassinating various Fox News clones, wicked pedophile Catholic priests and breaking the necks of persons done up to look like Dick Chaney.Another of Hollywood's--and the most blatant of the batch---Pro-terrorist films that follows the Al Queda/Liberal Party line right down to the periods and the commas. While also,by implication, Anti-semetic, the film makes VERY clear that in the Current War on Terror, it is the EVIL Christians(especially Catholics and Jews) and Conservatives on one side vs the heroic and Noble Moslem Terrorists, the Gay Agendists and the Liberals on the other. There is no parsing this and fudging it. This is EXACTLY what the film says along with justifing terrorism, promoting hatred and promulgating the most venomous lies. It is, short, one of the most evil films ever produced taking its rightful place along side THE BIRTH OF A NATION, THE ETERNAL JEW, MISSION TO MOSCOW, THE KILLING FIELDS and EARTH. It is hardly surprising that even Alan Moore, liberal hysteric he may be, had his name taken off the picture. This is the cinematic equivalent of MEIN KAMPF, THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO or THE KORAN. People will have their minds slaughtered because of this film. People's souls will be poisoned because of this film. People will die because of this film. People HAVE died because of this film.On the other hand, Hugo Weaving gives a wonderful performance and one imagines this will be popular at Liberal/Communist movie parties.",2,THE ETERNAL CHRISTIAN,1394409600,"03 10, 2014",2014,2147,"['V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', '2006', 'Created', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'Based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'Starring', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Hugo', 'Weaving.Set', 'not', 'too', 'far', 'future', 'England', 'controlled', 'Christian', 'Conservative', 'vaguely', 'Nazi/fascist', 'goverment', 'achieved', 'power', 'staging', 'fake', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'supposedly', 'Moslem', 'Extremists', 'current', 'govt', 'persecutes', 'Moslems', 'Gays', 'liberals', 'forcing', 'people', 'watch', 'what', 'supposed', 'be', 'Fox', 'News', 'Luckily', 'masked', 'super', 'powered', 'Terrorist/freedom', 'fighter', 'dressed', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'blowing', 'up', 'famous', 'landmark', 'buildings', 'training', 'populace', 'give', 'up', 'individuality', 'rise', 'up', 'govt', 'assassinating', 'various', 'Fox', 'News', 'clones', 'wicked', 'pedophile', 'Catholic', 'priests', 'breaking', 'necks', 'persons', 'done', 'up', 'look', 'Dick', 'Chaney.Another', 'Hollywood', 'most', 'blatant', 'batch', '-Pro-terrorist', 'films', 'Al', 'Queda/Liberal', 'Party', 'line', 'right', 'down', 'periods', 'commas', 'also', 'implication', 'Anti-semetic', 'film', 'VERY', 'clear', 'Current', 'War', 'Terror', 'EVIL', 'Christians', 'especially', 'Catholics', 'Jews', 'Conservatives', 'one', 'side', 'heroic', 'Noble', 'Moslem', 'Terrorists', 'Gay', 'Agendists', 'Liberals', 'other', 'parsing', 'fudging', 'EXACTLY', 'what', 'film', 'justifing', 'terrorism', 'promoting', 'hatred', 'promulgating', 'most', 'venomous', 'lies', 'short', 'one', 'most', 'evil', 'films', 'ever', 'produced', 'taking', 'rightful', 'place', 'side', 'THE', 'BIRTH', 'A', 'NATION', 'THE', 'ETERNAL', 'JEW', 'MISSION', 'TO', 'MOSCOW', 'THE', 'KILLING', 'FIELDS', 'EARTH', 'hardly', 'surprising', 'even', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'liberal', 'hysteric', 'may', 'be', 'had', 'name', 'taken', 'off', 'picture', 'cinematic', 'equivalent', 'MEIN', 'KAMPF', 'THE', 'COMMUNIST', 'MANIFESTO', 'THE', 'KORAN', 'People', 'will', 'have', 'minds', 'slaughtered', 'film', 'People', 'souls', 'will', 'be', 'poisoned', 'film', 'People', 'will', 'die', 'film', 'People', 'HAVE', 'died', 'film.On', 'other', 'hand', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'wonderful', 'performance', 'one', 'imagines', 'will', 'be', 'popular', 'Liberal/Communist', 'movie', 'parties']",N/A

176673,A1NSUJJCG73IRF,1419838830,"The Tweeder ""tweeder16""","[0, 0]","Director:  James McTeigueCast:  Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigott-Smith, Rupert Graves, Roger Allam, Ben Miles.Running Time: 132 minutesRated R for strong violence and some language.After a disappointing outcome in making ""The Matrix"" into a totally forgettable trilogy, the Wachowski brothers write a new film tackling the issues of terrorism and corruption between the bureaucratic governments in this futuristic look of Britain. As for newcomer James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the ""Matrix films"", provides a unique film that, while it drags slightly and takes time to make its point, is enthralling and entertaining nonetheless.  In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, ""Episode 3: Attack of the Clones"" and ""Garden State"") becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black (played by ""The Matrix"" trilogy's Hugo Weaving), who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name ""V"". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, in a fine supporting role) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator (John Hurt), whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. As the film progresses, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.""V for Vendetta"" is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and takes a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy. While based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, the film has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's""1984"". Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the forefront all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism. The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architect in ""Matrix Reloaded"", the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. ""Vendetta"" takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman provides a fine performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.  When the year 1984 approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year 2020 just around the corner, will ""V for Vendetta"" do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought.",4,V for Vendetta (2006),1154563200,"08 3, 2006",2006,4517,"['Director', 'James', 'McTeigueCast', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Tim', 'Pigott-Smith', 'Rupert', 'Graves', 'Roger', 'Allam', 'Ben', 'Miles.Running', 'Time', '132', 'minutesRated', 'R', 'strong', 'violence', 'language.After', 'disappointing', 'outcome', 'making', 'Matrix', 'totally', 'forgettable', 'trilogy', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'write', 'new', 'film', 'tackling', 'issues', 'terrorism', 'corruption', 'bureaucratic', 'governments', 'futuristic', 'look', 'Britain', 'newcomer', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'who', 'served', 'assistant', 'director', 'Matrix', 'films', 'unique', 'film', 'slightly', 'time', 'make', 'point', 'enthralling', 'entertaining', 'nonetheless', 'state', 'government', 'controlled', 'tyrant', 'state', 'civil', 'war', 'nowhere', 'safe', 'anyone', 'possible', 'suspect', 'terrorism', 'corrupt', 'leaders', 'crooked', 'officers', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'suspected', 'right', 'rebel', 'government', 'Evey', 'Hammond', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'Episode', '3', 'Attack', 'Clones', 'Garden', 'State', 'cornered', 'dark', 'alley', 'several', 'government', 'officers', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'one', 'thing', 'mind', 'Luckily', 'saved', 'power', 'hungry', 'officers', 'man', 'black', 'Guy-Fawkes', 'mask', 'weapon', 'choice', 'dozen', 'daggers', 'around', 'intrigued', 'man', 'black', 'played', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'who', 'second', 'thought', 'using', 'violence', 'mean', 'expression', 'rebellious', 'ideas', 'who', 'latter', 'been', 'labeled', 'terrorist', 'new', 'generation', 'given', 'name', 'V', 'curiosity', 'Evey', 'kidnapped', 'V', 'learns', 'lifestyles', 'Meanwhile', 'Inspector', 'Eric', 'Finch', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'fine', 'supporting', 'role', 'questioning', 'authority', 'nations', 'dictator', 'John', 'Hurt', 'face', 'blown', 'up', 'large', 'movie', 'screen', 'committee', 'displaying', 'ego', 'attempt', 'be', 'intimidating', 'council', 'film', 'begin', 'learn', 'reasoning', 'V', 'acts', 'terrorism', 'involving', 'explosions', 'national', 'monuments', 'mentality', 'violence', 'only', 'way', 'rebel', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'not', 'average', 'blockbuster', 'film', 'Instead', 'mind', 'blowing', 'stunts', 'constantly', 'thrown', 'audience', 'focus', 'dilemmas', 'characters', 'antihero', 'V', 'out', 'revenge', 'government', 'created', 'man', 'Using', 'anarchy', 'weapon', 'V', 'people', 'oppression', 'stand', 'corrupt', 'government', 'Evey', 'unwillingly', 'entangled', 'V', 'plan', 'V', 'alliance', 'Officer', 'Finch', 'question', 'ethics', 'loyalty', 'government', 'when', 'uncover', 'disturbing', 'conspiracy', 'based', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'graphic', 'novels', 'film', 'distinct', 'similarity', 'George', 'Orwell', '1984', 'Free', 'thought', 'taken', 'away', 'cultures', 'seen', 'radical', 'are', 'abolished', 'homosexuality', 'unaccepted', 'televisions', 'everywhere', 'watching', 'monitoring', 'conversations', 'Big', 'Brother', 'watching', 'political', 'side', 'second', 'fiddle', 'much', 'when', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'forefront', 'time', 'are', 'startling', 'references', 'history', 'Nazi', 'Germany', 'Gay', 'Fawkes', 'looking', 'modern', 'state', 'war', 'terrorism', 'problem', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'mix', 'affair', 'beginning', 'chaotic', 'unfocused', 'Much', 'when', 'Neo', 'Architect', 'Matrix', 'Reloaded', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'are', 'throwing', 'thesaurus', 'V', 'spitting', 'as', 'many', 'V', 'words', 'one', 'sentence', 'Vendetta', 'time', 'focus', 'when', 'really', 'gears', 'moving', 'sync', 'First', 'time', 'director', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'strong', 'job', 'flare', 'great', 'visuals', 'artistry.When', 'face', 'most', 'expression', 'insight', 'person', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'hard', 'task', 'bringing', 'expression', 'man', 'Gay', 'Fawkes', 'mask', 'great', 'mannerisms', 'commanding', 'voice', 'Weaving', 'immaculate', 'V.', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'fine', 'performance', 'Evey', 'even', 'shaved', 'head', 'still', 'beautiful', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'are', 'great', 'John', 'Hurt', 'disturbing', 'Adam', 'Sutler', 'booming', 'spiteful', 'voice', 'When', 'year', '1984', 'approached', 'people', 'wondered', 'George', 'Orwell', 'vision', 'future', 'would', 'come', 'fruition', 'year', '2020', 'just', 'corner', 'will', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'do', 'same', 'probably', 'not', 'provocative', 'somewhat', 'controversial', 'subject', 'matter', 'raise', 'questions', 'food', 'thought']",N/A

One can see what this film aspires to be--it contains obvious references to Michael Radford's adaptation of Orwell's 1984, David Fincher's adaptation of Palahniuk's FIGHT CLUB, and the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX--but it falls flat. 1984 provides us Winston Smith to win our empathy and pity. FIGHT CLUB suggests that the populace would develop a movement driven by passion. THE MATRIX offers a simple story but an innovative, visually riveting form of storytelling. The film V FOR VENDETTA glosses over the confusing dynamics of the relationship between V and Evey (Stockholm syndrome? love? brainwashing?), replaces activism with costuming, and lacks the visual verve one would expect from a Wachowski production. I should note that the masked Hugo Weaving performs impressively, given his reliance on his voice and postures to convey feeling, but the fine cast cannot save this muddled production.

It's intelligent, sophisticated, emotional, vivid, beautiful, well written, well acted, and well filmed. I saw it in the theater 5 times, I just kept feeling pulled back to it. I cried like a baby every time I saw it. It's utterly brilliant. If it were for the movie alone, I'd unquestionably rate it 5 stars.Such a pity, then, that the DVD transfer has obvious video problems. Particularly, the video brightness pulsates ever so slightly on about a twice a second rate. In scenes with bright color and lots of motion it's hardly noticable, but this is a story told in shades of black, so it gets rather glaring at times.

176677,A3M2WW0PO34B94,1419838830,thornhillatthemovies.com,"[14, 18]","A mysterious figure known as `V' (Hugo Weaving) begins an assault against England's government led by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt). He saves Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman, from the Fingermen, a covert branch of the government's police force. His first step is to attract the attention of the people and he does this by blowing up the Old Bailey, the symbol of law and justice within England, a system that no longer works. Sutler is outraged and immediately summons a meeting of his inner council, lording over them through a huge video screen. Sutler orders Finch (Stephen Rea), the leader of the police force, to find the perpetrator. As V wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout, it is difficult to identify him, so Finch zeroes in on Evey.M for Message""V for Vendetta"", written and produced by the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"" trilogy) and directed by James McTiegue is the latest entry in what I hope will be a continuing trend. We all know Hollywood loves blockbusters. Generally, these films are exercises allowing the filmmakers to trot out all of their tricks. Sort of like the old Mickey Rooney - Judy Garland films. ""Let's put on a show"" followed by a huge, elaborate musical in their backyard, or the barn, with great musical numbers, full orchestras, but little rhyme or reason. In today's Hollywood, a new film is the excuse to showcase any new special effects or stunts, showcasing the `talents' of everyone involved. Story? Story is unimportant. ""Look at all of the cool crap we can blow up. Let's put on a show.""With ""Batman Begins"" and now ""V for Vendetta"" (yes, in Hollywood, two films count as a trend. I would consider ""Terminator 2"" part of the trend but that was released too long ago) we see a movement to create blockbusters which also attempt to say something. ""Vendetta"" tries to incorporate messages about government control, some of which may be viewed as parables for our current administration.T for ThematicBased on a graphic novel, the author has removed his name from the film because he was unhappy with the thematic changes in the story. His graphic novel was created with a critical eye towards Margaret Thatcher's Tory government. I have never read the graphic novel, so I can't comment on any changes, but the film seems to be more a critique of the current British and American governments.There are scenes depicting wire tapping, prolonged wars, chemical experiments which may have lead to chemical warfare, spin doctors, government control in the face of paranoia, political talk show hosts and more.V for VisualThe film creates an interesting visual universe blending elements of modern design, the Nazis, Big Brother, the 1940s, and ""Phantom of the Opera"". These ideas and images blend together far too easily and help create a world which seems a little old fashioned and a little modern. Visually, this works extremely well with the thematic elements, reinforcing the message for every two steps forwards, we take one step back.H for History""Vendetta"" is set in the future, but as historians will tell you those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. The film begins with a prologue depicting the story of Guy Fawkes, the man who attempted to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605. Moving forward more than 400 years, ""Vendetta"" begins on November 4 and as soon as the clock strikes midnight, V blows up the Old Bailey.B for Back-storyBut we have questions and the questions need to be answered. Who is V? How did he come about? What prompted him to begin his current journey? What is Evey's background? How did the Chancellor come to rule Britain with an iron grip? These are important things for us to know, to help make these characters believable and interesting. And the filmmakers realize this importance. A considerable amount of screen time is spent portraying part of these histories; through a series of back stories and montages, we learn these things, adding depth and interest to the story. If you think about it, few dramas made in Hollywood today devote this much time to the back-story, let alone a big budget `action' film.O for ObserverAt one point, there may be too much back story. Because so much time is devoted to four or five various bits of history, these serve to take us out of the story, making us an observer, not a participant. We almost, not quite but almost disconnect from the story. Just as V expects British citizens to realize they need to stand up and fight for their rights, the filmmakers expect us to participate in the film. Passive observance isn't enough for this film, yet it almost gets that. One of the back stories in particular tests our resolve; it seems unnecessary to learn about a character we never actually meet the person in the film.G for GoodNatalie Portman is good as Evey Hammond, the young woman who becomes V's unwitting accomplice. Initially, she is just like every other British citizen; trying to deal with the past while surviving in the present with little overt concern about the future. How does she do this? She tries to forget the past and complacently deal with the present. As she becomes embroiled in Vs plot, she begins to gain strength, to become an ally to the masked man. It is an interesting performance. Throughout a significant portion of the film, her character is imprisoned, tortured or interrogated. After this, she is still not completely committed to V's cause, the transformation continues. It is testament to everyone involved that Evey never becomes a superhero, always remaining a human being. It is her resolve, her persona that must change.H for HeroHugo Weaving (Agent Smith, ""The Matrix"" trilogy) has the most difficult role; behind a mask throughout, he has to create a character without facial expressions. He does this in a manner of ways, through words, body language, and action. His hands and arms, the cock of his head, his voice, all lend to his character. On more than one occasion, he uses riddles to temporarily perplex his foes. At one point, a speech uses seemingly every word beginning with the letter `V'. This verbal exposition provides a unique, fun and interesting dimension to his character.More importantly, Weaving manages to convey the various complexities of his character. Technically, he is an outlaw, but we see the world he lives in, through his eyes, and realize he is more of a hero. Some of his actions may appear severe, but his character is living in desperate times. Desperate times call for desperate measures.S for SupportThe supporting cast is universally good, providing an interesting level to the film. Stephen Rea is the standout as Finch, the leader of the traditional police. He begins to realize the problems with the current regime, yet still must carryout his job. Throughout, we see the conflict on his face, testing him every minute, Stephen Fry is very good as a television personality hiding a secret from the world. John Hurt is suitably ominous as Chancellor Sutler, always appearing on large video screens. Tim Piggot-Smith is very good as the head of the Fingermen, the government's version of the Gestapo.C for Conclusion""V for Vendetta"" is a very well-made film with a lot of ideas and messages. It is not a traditional action film. There are a few choreographed fight sequences, but the majority of the film is a drama, exploring how V and Evey will change there country, for the better, for the worse, through their actions and the actions of the people.",4,E For Excellent,1142899200,"03 21, 2006",2006,7465,"['mysterious', 'figure', 'known', 'V', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'assault', 'England', 'government', 'led', 'Chancellor',

176681,A2UNMXBJSVIXFB,1419838830,Tony Khamvongsouk,"[7, 7]","Movie - 4.5V for Vendetta strikes me as a well-scripted Chex Mix that serves as a superhero, revolutionary, and revenge movie all at once. But what makes the gunpowder treason and plot so interesting is the character of V himself and the circumstances in which his ""quest"" ultimately reveals a number of poignant observations. Aside from the obvious parallel between he and The Count of Monte Cristo, I particularly find the whole ""rebellion against authority"" theme to be a refreshing testament to the way certain governments can sometimes be a bit too controlling or ironically nave for their own good, which in turn can cause said revolution. This is best portrayed through the character of Evey who, along with everyone else, had conformed and obeyed to the whims of a harsh and suffocating dictatorship for so long. And as history (or even science) has proven, for every action, there is indeed an equal and opposite reaction; authority &lt;--> rebellion. But in one of the more unique twists, this revenge and rebellion is all catalyzed under the guise of a Guy Fawkes-masked vindicator whose actions also indeed can fit that of a textbook terrorist. 9/11 undertones are easily apparent when they mention the symbol of a building being destroyed and its ability to change the world for better or worse. I don't know when this graphic novel was written, but apparently the symbolism is justifiably and eerily accurate for what it's worth. I suppose it just depends on which side you're coming from and the amount of subjectivity involved when trying to observe such events. But in the end, I really enjoyed this movie for its extremely good choice in having cast Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey. The only problems I had were a few pacing issues with the screenplay, that might've been better resolved with either a longer run time or more immersing musical score.Video - 3.5Presented in VC-1 with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio, I took a look at the bitrates (mostly in the high teens and low 20s) and it appears Warner Bros. used the exact same transfer from the previously released HD-DVD (aka the more inferior release). After reading the BD review of Batman Begins, I am now convinced that during the format war, some movies may have unexpectedly gotten the shaft in terms of a faithful transfer/encode. Because of the mere max capacity of 30GBs on a dual-layered HD-DVD, there wasn't as much space for as good a transfer/encode. The result: a few movies not quite meeting up to BD expectations LIKE a Batman Begins, V for Vendetta, and whatever else I might have in my library that was caught up in the war. Needless to say, while the BD presentation here is good, it's probably nowhere near as good as it could be. Colors are vivid, but not as in depth as I've seen in older, albeit newly-encoded, titles. Sharpness is around what you'd expect for an HD presentation, but some scenes looked a tad grainy and fuzzy (and not the good kind, like a Bourne Identity on BD, which by the way was re-encoded and looks great with the higher bitrates). Blacks aren't particularly deep either, which is a shame as it's a pretty dark movie. I'm disappointed, but it's better than DVD anyway...Audio - 4.0In addition, this TrueHD 5.1 track also seems to be a direct copy of the HD-DVD's. I don't have any HD-DVDs to compare, but I've heard other Warner Bros. titles with the same option, and they are remarkably more in depth than what we're given on this BD. Most of the film is dialogue and comes through very crisp (not that it should be hard), but the more action-focused scenes were lacking in surround usage. Music (one of the problems I had with the film overall) also seems less immersing than I'd like (where at least Batman Begins had a terrific score). LFEs were pretty good on a couple of scenes, though, such as the first fight where V introduces himself and that very cool montage with the dominoes. It's not quite up to snuff with other BDs having only an average bitrate between 1.6 and 2.1Mbps, but it's better than regular Dolby Digital.Extras - 3.5I enjoyed the extras, which consist mostly of behind-the-scenes footage concerning production and writing, but I felt there weren't enough. The one segment making comparisons between V and a terrorist is especially interesting, though they could've offered a little more subjectivity to the ideas and overall concepts of what this could represent in society. All features are in SD.Overall - 4.0I really enjoyed this film for its unique twist on the superhero genre -- to essentially portray the hero as a terrorist. Much like its script (which is supremely enunciated by Hugo Weaving), the cast is excellent with a special commendation to John Hurt who basically just talks on a giant TV for most of the film. But regardless, the plot itself touches upon many subtleties about authority, self-will, the power of symbolism, and its ability to withstand the test of time, be it through censorship, controlled viewing, etc. I highly recommend this for the great story. But with only an average A/V transfer thanks to HD-DVD's inferiority and the laziness of Warner Bros. studios to do a proper re-encoding, we fans of V may have to wait for an eventual double dip, along with some of their other catalog titles.",4,V for Vendetta (Blu-ray),1233705600,"02 4, 2009",2009,5279,"['Movie', '4.5V', 'Vendetta', 'strikes', 'well-scripted', 'Chex', 'Mix', 'superhero',

How do you inspire a nation that's been bullied into silence?The story begins with a comment on the power of an individual idea. Additionally, we are given a brief history of a failed rebellion in Great Britain and the man behind it, Guy Fawkes (portrayed by Clive Ashborn). Next, we flash-forward to an unspecified point in the United Kingdom's future. A future in which a man by the name of Lewis Prothero (called The Voice of London and played by Roger Allam) has his own nightly broadcast and uses it to espouse his own political beliefs which always ends with the phrase ""good guys win, bad guys lose, and, as always, England prevails"". Prothero is shown to the viewer on two different screens being watched by two different people. One of them, Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is preparing for an evening out and turns off her television as she leaves, saying ""That's quite enough of that. Thank you very much."" The other viewer is left unidentified. Once Hammond has left her home, a public address system notifies the citizenry that a ""yellow coded"" curfew is now in effect. Worried that she might face consequences if she is discovered, Hammond suddenly hurries. Unfortunately, she is accosted by two men. Soon after threatening her, they identify themselves as government officials and make it clear that they intend to assault her. All seems lost for Ms. Hammond until a masked man, (voiced by Hugo Weaving) intervenes on her behalf. Our man in the mask subdues Ms Hammond's attackers and then tells her that she may call him V. V claims to be a musician on the way to a concert and asks Evey to join him. V appears delusional to Evey at first, conducting a symphony that she can neither see nor hear, when the same public address system that informed of the curfew begins playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Before the song is finished, she is surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture. As V revels in the destruction of the Old Bailey, it becomes clear to Evey that he was responsible and as government officials observe her next to V in the surveillance footage, they incorrectly assume Evey was somehow involved.When V for Vendetta was first in theaters, it was the source of much debate. Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story. Others worried that it justified terrorism. Having not read the graphic novel, I can't comment on the first part. On the second part, at the time it occurred, people might've seen the Boston Tea Party as terrorism. In a totalitarian state, where dissent is a criminal act in and of itself, terrorism might very well be the best vehicle for change. And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it was released on DVD and I will, no doubt, watch it many more. If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should.

176687,A1E2POEKKLNLD9,1419838830,"Triniman ""Triniman""","[22, 42]","V for Vendetta, based on the graphic novels by British writer Alan Moore, is the first new film by the Wachowski Brothers since the final Matrix film. And we know how disappointing that series turned out to be.The setting is in the not too distant future in the fascist police state of England, where deviant art, culture and sexual behavior is outlawed and nighttime curfews are strictly enforced. The public broadcaster is essentially the Ministry of Propaganda, and they put the government's spin on events to constantly cover up the truth about crimes of dissention.Our protagonist wears a Guy Fawkes mask (the guy who tried to blow up the British parliament buildings in 1605) to conceal both his identity and his burned face. He rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) - who was on her way to dinner at a co-workers house - from a sexual attack by the curfew authorities (the ""Fingermen"").By coincidence, they ran into each other again at the public broadcaster's office, where he managed to air a pre-recorded explanation of his ""terrorist"" demolition of a government building (the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court) the night before, which the government tried to cover up by calling it a scheduled demolition. I didn't buy how she bonded easily and agreed to live with this creepy stranger so quickly in his windowless lair/deviant culture museum.Natalie Portman is miscast as a Brit and but despite her poor attempt to fake the accent, her performance was all right. Hugo Weaving's ""V"" character is foiled by the useless cute aliteration in his opening scene as well as his quoting of the Bard to suggest his wit, intellectual depth and credibility of his largely symbolic mission. John Hurt plays the leader of the government, a Hitler-esque fascist, but he was largely one-dimensional. Stephen Rea as detective Finch does the best with his lines.In the film, there is a conspiracy story regarding human experimentation, deliberate unleashing of deadly viruses, huge profits for the cure, people falsely arrested under the pretense of being terrorists, people concealing deviant sexual lives, etc. The story could have had more impact for me if there wasn't such an ambitious attempt to stage a spectacle, both visually and story-wise.The Wachowski Brothers aren't known for carrying a story with subtlety and intrigue and instead hammer you over the head with action and scenes that could have been edited out. The story seemed squandered rather than focused and tight.I wouldn't see this film again and give it a rating of 2/5.",2,"...for the masses, but not that good",1142553600,"03 17, 2006",2006,2544,"['V', 'Vendetta', 'based', 'graphic', 'novels', 'British', 'writer', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'first', 'new', 'film', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'final', 'Matrix', 'film', 'know', 'how', 'disappointing', 'series', 'turned', 'out', 'be.The', 'setting', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'fascist', 'police', 'state', 'England', 'where', 'deviant', 'art', 'culture', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'outlawed', 'nighttime', 'curfews', 'are', 'strictly', 'enforced', 'public', 'broadcaster', 'essentially', 'Ministry', 'Propaganda', 'put', 'government', 'spin', 'events', 'constantly', 'cover', 'up', 'truth', 'crimes', 'dissention.Our', 'protagonist', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'mask', 'guy', 'who', 'tried', 'blow', 'up', 'British', 'parliament', 'buildings', '1605', 'conceal', 'identity', 'burned', 'face', 'Evey', 'Hammond', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'was', 'way', 'dinner', 'co-workers', 'house', 'sexual', 'attack', 'curfew', 'authorities', 'Fingermen', '.By', 'coincidence', 'ran', 'other', 'again', 'public', 'broadcaster', 'office', 'where', 'managed', 'air', 'pre-recorded', 'explanation', 'terrorist', 'demolition', 'government', 'building', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'Central', 'Criminal', 'Court', 'night', 'government', 'tried', 'cover', 'up', 'calling', 'scheduled', 'demolition', 'did', ""n't"", 'buy', 'how', 'bonded', 'easily', 'agreed', 'live', 'creepy', 'stranger', 'so', 'quickly', 'windowless', 'lair/deviant', 'culture', 'museum.Natalie', 'Portman', 'miscast', 'Brit', 'poor', 'attempt', 'fake', 'accent', 'performance', 'was', 'right', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'V', 'character', 'foiled', 'useless', 'cute', 'aliteration', 'opening', 'scene', 'as', 'well', 'quoting', 'Bard', 'suggest', 'wit', 'intellectual', 'depth', 'credibility', 'largely', 'symbolic', 'mission', 'John', 'Hurt', 'leader', 'government', 'Hitler-esque', 'fascist', 'was', 'largely', 'one-dimensional', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'detective', 'Finch', 'best', 'lines.In', 'film', 'conspiracy', 'story', 'regarding', 'human', 'experimentation', 'deliberate', 'unleashing', 'deadly', 'viruses', 'huge', 'profits', 'cure', 'people', 'falsely', 'arrested', 'pretense', 'being', 'terrorists', 'people', 'concealing', 'deviant', 'sexual', 'lives', 'etc', 'story', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'more', 'impact', 'was', ""n't"", 'such', 'ambitious', 'attempt', 'stage', 'spectacle', 'visually', 'story-wise.The', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'are', ""n't"", 'known', 'carrying', 'story', 'subtlety', 'intrigue', 'instead', 'hammer', 'head', 'action', 'scenes', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'edited', 'out', 'story', 'seemed', 'squandered', 'rather', 'focused', 'tight.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'see', 'film', 'again', 'give', 'rating', '2/5']",N/A

I've had to stop and think a moment before I could even remember what movie I'd seen. They're all alike, or remade, or just generic mannequins doing predictable things, so that it's nearly impossible to tell them apart.Not so with V for Vendetta: you won't forget what you've seen!Its chief resemblance to the book is that both are flawed, not perfect by any means -- but there is so much more to love than to lament! Both entertain, provoke, and haunt you with home truths, both move to laughter and to tears, and leave scenes replaying in your imagination.The movie was wonderfully faithful to the book, not in every detail, but more than faithful in spirit. The graphic novel had many subplots, which filled out the story but at times almost detracted, or at least distracted, from the key ideas. A movie, of necessity, must pare things down a bit, but in this case it was like chipping away excess to reveal the facets and true colors at the heart of a gem.What remains is a haunting melody about the human spirit: we do mess things up badly, but even greater is our propensity to overcome and be transformed. The movie added focus to the ways V adapted to unthinkable torment, and the way Evey (and the woman letter-writer) discovered in the worst of times that our ""last inch"" of integrity is really our only treasure.* The movie highlighted the way the human spirit responds to horror and brutality--to survive, surmount, and transcend, becoming more than we were before. V rescued and preserved the best of the human spirit -- not just in the art and music and books he treasured, but also in himself. He could have become a monster, but it was his love--for humanity, for beauty, for humor, for integrity--that kept him from the edge.* The movie also emphasized that ideas are powerful instruments of change, and ideas can't be killed. If change is to be accomplished, it cannot be by the will of one man (like the despotic Chancellor), but must truly reflect the will of the governed. (The deployment of the Fed-Ex packages, for instance.) ;)I heard that Moore had at first withdrawn, but had a change of heart about the film--I hope that's true because, as the creator who wrote the above points across so many minds and hearts, he should be thrilled and proud.My deep gratitude to both Moore and the briliant creators of this film.

To do so, `V' employs a Guy Fawkes method - well, blow up the Old Bailey, you know - and he does it with accompanied music, before an accidental witness Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who becomes the suspect of the case, chased by the secret police.[NATALIE PORTMAN as BALLERINA?] The far-fetched story contains as many elements as possible - actions, humors, imprisonment, and even romance - and there is always something right in front of you that is interesting to see, like the interior of `V''s room, his penchant for using theatrical manners, or believe me or not, one pinkish ballerina clothes Portman wears. The film certainly has several good action sequences, but what is fascinating may be the character of `V' himself, and the far-reaching effects that changes the life of other characters including Evey.To me, however, two actors from UK are more impressive than `V' and Evey. They are Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch and Stephen Fry as popular TV show host. They both represent the ordinary people who attempt to follow their conscience even under the fascist regime without using the terrorist tactics that `V' employs. And they know they are very weak, like Jonathan Pryce's hero in `Brazil.'Compared with them, the acting Portman looks sometimes weak, with the British accent that appears and disappears. The film's reference to one Dumas novel is too obvious, and even detracting. There is one big twist in the middle part of the film, which is not convincing, and most of all, John Hurt's `Sutler,' always yelling before the monitor, is not my idea of the fascist leader in the 21st century. And as to the film's explanation about the emergence of UK's dark totalitarian society, it is as credible as the big secret of the `Matrix.'`V for Vendetta' is absolutely a `love-or-hate' film. Its unmistakable message is represented by the words of `V,' but some of you may find it shallow, and say no one in the truly totalitarian society can act like `V'. It is a curious mixture of the childish (anti-)heroism of musketeer and the sinister image of terrorist. The film tries to mix them, but is not always successful. Still the film's stylish actions and images with unexpected humor are undeniable.",4,V for Visuals and Very Stylish Ones: Masked Musketeer in Totalitarian World,1149465600,"06 5, 2006",2006,2948,"['may', 'like', 'not', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'produced', 'Joel', 'Silver', 'one', 'strongest', 'players', 'Hollywood', 'one', 'successful', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'script', 'V', 'written', 'none', 'other', 'Wachowski', 'Brothers', 'First-time', 'director', 'James', 'McTeigue', 'worked', 'assistant', 'director', 'three', 'Matrix', 'one', 'Star', 'Wars', 'yes', 'titular', 'V', 'played', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'time', 'however', 'never', 'see', 'face', 'hidden', 'mask', 'Agent', 'Smith', 'wearing', 'glasses', 'fewer', 'action', 'scenes.', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'set', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'England', 'near', 'future', 'where', 'one', 'masked', 'anti-hero', 'shakes', 'nation', 'political', 'system', 'controlled', 'one', 'Chancellor', 'Adam', 'Sutler', 'John', 'Hurt', 'do', 'so', 'V', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'method', 'well', 'blow', 'up', 'Old', 'Bailey', 'know', 'accompanied', 'music', 'accidental', 'witness', 'Evey', 'Hammond', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'who', 'suspect', 'case', 'chased', 'secret', 'police', 'NATALIE', 'PORTMAN', 'BALLERINA', ']', 'far-fetched', 'story', 'contains', 'many', 'elements', 'possible', 'actions', 'humors', 'imprisonment', 'even', 'romance', 'always', 'something', 'right', 'front', 'interesting', 'see', 'interior', 'V', 's', 'room', 'penchant', 'using', 'theatrical', 'manners', 'believe', 'not', 'one', 'pinkish', 'ballerina', 'clothes', 'Portman', 'film', 'certainly', 'several', 'good', 'action', 'sequences', 'what', 'fascinating', 'may', 'be', 'character', 'V', 'far-reaching', 'effects', 'life', 'other', 'characters', 'including', 'Evey.To', 'however', 'two', 'actors', 'UK', 'are', 'more', 'impressive', 'V', 'Evey', 'are', 'Stephen', 'Rea', 'Inspector', 'Finch', 'Stephen', 'Fry', 'popular', 'TV', 'show', 'host', 'represent', 'ordinary', 'people', 'who', 'attempt', 'follow', 'conscience', 'even', 'fascist', 'regime', 'using', 'terrorist', 'tactics', 'V', 'know', 'are', 'very', 'weak', 'Jonathan', 'Pryce', 'hero', 'Brazil', ""'Compared"", 'acting', 'Portman', 'sometimes', 'weak', 'British', 'accent', 'disappears', 'film', 'reference', 'one', 'Dumas', 'novel', 'too', 'obvious', 'even', 'detracting', 'one', 'big', 'twist', 'middle', 'part', 'film', 'not', 'convincing', 'most', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Sutler', 'always', 'yelling', 'monitor', 'not', 'idea', 'fascist', 'leader', '21st', 'century', 'film', 'explanation', 'emergence', 'UK', 'dark', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'as', 'credible', 'big', 'secret', 'Matrix', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'absolutely', 'love-or-hate', 'film', 'unmistakable', 'message', 'represented', 'words', 'V', 'may', 'find', 'shallow', 'say', 'one', 'truly', 'totalitarian', 'society', 'can', 'act', 'V', 'curious', 'mixture', 'childish', 'anti-', 'heroism', 'musketeer', 'sinister', 'image', 'terrorist', 'film', 'tries', 'mix', 'not', 'always', 'successful', 'Still', 'film', 'stylish', 'actions', 'images', 'unexpected', 'humor', 'are', 'undeniable']",N/A
176691,A96K1ZGW56S2I,1419838830,"tvtv3 ""tvtv3""","[7, 10]","Guy Fawkes was an Englishman who disagreed with English politics so much that he attempted to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  He was a member of a conspiracy to overthrow the government, but was captured before the plot could be completed.  Under extreme torture he revealed the names of the other conspirators and they were all hung together.  Each year in England and other parts of the British Commonwealth Guy Fawkes day is celebrated on November 5 with bonfires that burn effigies of Guy Fawkes, fireworks, and massive parties.Information like this is not usually needed to enjoy and understand a movie. However, when the movie is as deep, complex, and dark as V FOR VENDETTA the information above is essential to understanding the film.  V FOR VENDETTA is based upon a graphic novel written by Alan Moore.  The movie takes place in a not all that too distant future.  The world is a complex hybrid of George Orwell's 1984 and Aldous Huxley's A BRAVE NEW WORLD.  Due to a misguided war of domination, the United States is no longer a superpower and Britain is back in control with a new Empire.The country is led (actually ruled) by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt).  Sutler rules the country with an iron hand and makes his ways known to the public through a variety of messages that he broadcasts via huge video screens and across the nation's television network.  The populace seems to have become addicted to amusement and spends the majority of their time watching television. They know that most of the news they hear is actually made up, but they still watch and listen.On a clear night at midnight on November 5th, V (Hugo Weaving) blows up the Banking Building in London.  Later in the day, he hijacks the news station and broadcasts a message to the country asking the citizens to join him in one year from the day when they will begin a revolution, eradicate Parliament, and begin things anew.  ""Remember, remember the fifth of November.""  While at the television station, V is joined by Evey (Natalie Portman) a woman he saved from being raped and arrested the night before.  Evey is knocked unconscious during the chaos and V brings her back to his secret lair.  As the plot thickens, Evey becomes V's accomplice as he begins killing various government officials who were responsible for secret government killings of their own citizens.  The action rises and falls like the graceful melody of a symphony until the final act when all the game pieces are put into place and checkmate is called.V FOR VENDETTA is based off of a comic book, but it's not like a typical comic book movie.  In most comic book movies, though there might be a great deal of character development there is a ton of action, not a great deal of dialogue, and hardly any serious thinking necessary by the viewer.  V FOR VENDETTA does have a great deal of character development, but other than that and the mask and costume that V wears, that's about the only similarities between this and the average comic book film.  The film is full of serious dialogue, witty diatribes, and monologues full of alliteration.  This wonderful wordplay just isn't amusing; it also forces the audience to think about what the speakers are saying.  Words are meaningful and have power and V FOR VENDETTA does an excellent job of illustrating this.Also, V FOR VENDETTA doesn't really have a traditional hero.  Though it could be argued that Evey is the film's heroine, we don't see her in action or on screen long enough to know whether she is the heroine.  Instead, we are presented with the actions of V and it is he himself that the movie revolves.  It can be argued that V is the hero because he performs some truly heroic actions during the course of the film:  he prevents Evey from being raped, he leads a popular uprising against a tyrannical dictatorship, he fights battles for the average citizens, and he salvages works or Art from destruction.  At the same time, V performs his very heroic deeds through some very dishonorable and ignoble means, for example he murders people and performs acts of massive terrorism.  Many might decide that a character such as V is too much like those who destroyed the World Trade Center and attacked the Pentagon to be a hero.Overall, V FOR VENDETTA is a very entertaining and thought-provoking film.  The film doesn't rely upon action to move the story along, is full of character development, and contains some extraordinary witty wordplay.  I enjoyed the movie and anyone who enjoys an action movie that requires thinking will, too.",5,Comic Book Movie That Thinks.,1144972800,"04 14, 2006",2006,4558,"['Guy', 'Fawkes', 'was', 'Englishman', 'who', 'disagreed', 'English', 'politics', 'so', 'much', 'attempted', 'blow', 'up', 'Parliament', 'November', '5', '1605', 'was', 'member', 'conspiracy', 'overthrow', 'government', 'was', 'captured', 'plot', 'could', 'be', 'completed', 'extreme', 'torture', 'revealed', 'names', 'other', 'conspirators', 'were', 'hung', 'together', 'year', 'England', 'other', 'parts', 'British', 'Commonwealth', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'day', 'celebrated', 'November', '5', 'bonfires', 'burn', 'effigies', 'Guy', 'Fawkes', 'fireworks', 'massive', 'parties.Information', 'not', 'usually', 'needed', 'enjoy', 'understand', 'movie', 'However', 'when', 'movie', 'as', 'deep', 'complex', 'dark', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'information', 'essential', 'understanding', 'film', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'based', 'graphic', 'novel', 'written', 'Alan', 'Moore', 'movie', 'place', 'not', 'too', 'distant', 'future', 'world', 'complex', 'hybrid', 'George', 'Orwell', '1984', 'Aldous', 'Huxley', 'A', 'BRAVE', 'NEW', 'WORLD', 'Due', 'misguided', 'war', 'domination', 'United', 'States', 'no', 'longer', 'superpower', 'Britain', 'back', 'control', 'new', 'Empire.The', 'country', 'led', 'actually', 'ruled', 'Chancellor', 'Sutler', 'John', 'Hurt', 'Sutler', 'rules', 'country', 'iron', 'hand', 'ways', 'known', 'public', 'variety', 'messages', 'huge', 'video', 'screens', 'nation', 'television', 'network', 'populace', 'have', 'become', 'addicted', 'amusement', 'majority', 'time', 'watching', 'television', 'know', 'most', 'news', 'hear', 'actually', 'made', 'up', 'still', 'watch', 'listen.On', 'clear', 'night', 'midnight', 'November', '5th', 'V', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'up', 'Banking', 'Building', 'London', 'Later', 'day', 'news', 'station', 'message', 'country', 'asking', 'citizens', 'join', 'one', 'year', 'day', 'when', 'will', 'begin', 'revolution', 'eradicate', 'Parliament', 'begin', 'things', 'anew', 'Remember', 'remember', 'fifth', 'November', 'television', 'station', 'V', 'joined', 'Evey', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'woman', 'saved', 'being', 'raped', 'arrested', 'night', 'Evey', 'knocked', 'unconscious', 'chaos', 'V', 'back', 'secret', 'lair', 'plot', 'thickens', 'Evey', 'V', 'accomplice', 'killing', 'various', 'government', 'officials', 'who', 'were', 'responsible', 'secret', 'government', 'killings', 'own', 'citizens', 'action', 'graceful', 'melody', 'symphony', 'final', 'act', 'when', 'game', 'pieces', 'are', 'put', 'place', 'checkmate', 'called.V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'based', 'comic', 'book', 'not', 'typical', 'comic', 'book', 'movie', 'most', 'comic', 'book', 'movies', 'might', 'be', 'great', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'ton', 'action', 'not', 'great', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'hardly', 'serious', 'thinking', 'necessary', 'viewer', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'have', 'great', 'deal', 'character', 'development', 'other', 'mask', 'costume', 'V', 'wears', 'only', 'similarities', 'average', 'comic', 'book', 'film', 'film', 'full', 'serious', 'dialogue', 'witty', 'diatribes', 'monologues', 'full', 'alliteration', 'wonderful', 'wordplay', 'just', ""n't"", 'amusing', 'also', 'audience', 'think', 'what', 'speakers', 'are', 'saying', 'Words', 'are', 'meaningful', 'have', 'power', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'excellent', 'job', 'illustrating', 'this.Also', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', ""n't"", 'really', 'have', 'traditional', 'hero', 'could', 'be', 'argued', 'Evey', 'film', 'heroine', 'do', ""n't"", 'see', 'action', 'screen', 'long', 'enough', 'know', 'heroine', 'Instead', 'are', 'presented', 'actions', 'V', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'argued', 'V', 'hero', 'truly', 'heroic', 'actions', 'course', 'film', 'being', 'raped', 'popular', 'uprising', 'tyrannical', 'dictatorship', 'battles', 'average', 'citizens', 'Art', 'destruction', 'same', 'time', 'V', 'very', 'heroic', 'deeds', 'very', 'dishonorable', 'ignoble', 'means', 'example', 'people', 'performs', 'acts', 'massive', 'terrorism', 'Many', 'might', 'decide', 'character', 'such', 'V', 'too', 'much', 'who', 'destroyed', 'World', 'Trade', 'Center', 'attacked', 'Pentagon', 'be', 'hero.Overall', 'V', 'FOR', 'VENDETTA', 'very', 'entertaining', 'thought-provoking', 'film', 'film', ""n't"", 'rely', 'upon', 'action', 'move', 'story', 'full', 'character', 'development', 'extraordinary', 'witty', 'wordplay', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'anyone', 'who', 'action', 'movie', 'thinking', 'will', 'too']",N/A

176694,AWRGM17GTMND8,1419838830,"Tyler S. ""Super-Review""","[3, 3]","I saw the movie first, read the book after, and then watched the film again.  The creators of this film took intelligence and delicacy into making a nearly flawless adaptation.  Reason Being?  Material that didn't make it to film is what would have destroyed it.  V for Vendetta is not a word for word translation.  V the film is a updated and different approach with everything that was the heart and soul of the book.  They snipped and cut what they needed to and added fresh material to give the film more substance.I really feel sorry for Alan Moore after the LXG movie.  It really did no justice to him, and it did not display any of his writing talent.  V for Vendetta however is bleeding with Moore dialogue.  More than half of the films dialogue comes straight from the graphic novel, and it's really inspiring to see a hollywood movie do justice like that.  And even the new and different scenes compliment the Alan Moore setting like you never would have guessed.  Graphic novels like Watchmen and V are very cinematic but not everything can translate to film.  Although it was nearly the same, the Watchmen picture did have a entirely different ending.  This is simply because you can do different things in books that you can't in film.Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman?  Who would have thought? This duo turned out to be the best idea the film had.  I'm not familiar with the other actors but they certainly deserve more and more screen time in their future.  Portman is significantly different from the girl in the novel, but it was a smart move for the film.  The independent and thought-provoking Evey in the film is way more interesting and inspiring than the girl in the book. Giving her a smarter role really gave the audience something more interesting.  And Hugo?  What can I say? Hugo has never basterdized a role in a film.  He was spot on with V.V for Vendetta is one of the benchmark comic book movies that really got it right.  After seeing this I regained hope for all adaptations, because this one director thought to preserve the art of the book, and not just sell it.  We really take for granted how much these people work to make a film an artwork, when one can simply just sell it with action, effects, and sexuality.

It has to be difficult to use purely gesture and voice inflection to play a part, and he was excellent!

A message and a glimpse.A glimpse of the future. It is inevitably true that all empires corrupt and must be overthrown. This movie is a reminder, a warning, and a set of instructions.

V (Hugo Weaving)is bound and determined for justice and that includes taking down the government of a man (John Hurt)who has turned England into a God fearing police state. V is on a time table to undo this government as the government is looking for him. In a TV broadcast he tells England he will take out the House of Paraliment by November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day in England)and asks the population to show their support by being there when he does it. The film though turns on the relationship between V and Evey (Natalie Portman)the daughter of two revolutionaries put to death by the government when she was a child. She represents us as she observes V and slowly comes to understand his madness. When she is saved by V from rape by members of the government she is thrown into a world she can no longer make heads nor tails of. Clearly this film isn't going to be for everyone and fans of Alan Moore's graphic novel will probably be disappointed. No matter the film manages to tell a gripping story for a mainstream Hollywood release. This isn't ""The Matrix"" nor is it ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". It's better than the Matrix sequels but not quite as great as I'd hoped. It's still an entertaining film. It's clear by the vote count here that somehow I've been unhelpful. I'm not quite sure what folks were looking for here but this film did appeal to me even if it wasn't perfect.V may be a bit naive (when he takes out the government he believes that the people will take back power and the government will fear them instead of the people fearing the government)he's also a fascinating mixture of vigilante, hero and villan. Stylishly directed by James McTeigue (assistant director of ""The Matrix"" here helming his first film)with beautiful cinematography by the late Adrian Bittle (""The World is Not Enough"", ""Aliens"" and ""Thelma & Louise"")""V for Vendetta"" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it.

Right from the beginning, I could see that this was Alan Moore's homage to Orwell and ""1984"" - he was most likely inspired by the book as the title's date approached and Moore observed Thatcher's England and Reagan's America unfold. What an amazing story ""V for Vendetta"" told. Alan Moore saw that Fascism was still alive and well in the world of 1984 as it was in Orwell's Post WWII 1940s.Jump forward 20 years, and we have a retelling of this amazing story, but this time on film instead of the comic panel. In this day and age of Terrorism, the fear of Terrorism, and the Fascist use of that fear, the story is more important than ever in Bush's America/World. Fear is the most powerful tool of the fascist as has been demonstrated in both the real world - Nazi Germany and Post 9/11 America - and in fiction - ""1984"" and ""V for Vendetta"".  ""V for Vendetta"" capture's this by potraying a not-to-distant future where plague and terrorism have crippled the world and are  cooped by the fearful conservative right (where all fascism is born as they are similar psychoses) to control the masses and ""protect"" the people.Though Moore set ""V"" in his native England, 20 years after its writing it could have been set in Post 9/11 America where even treehugging is consider terrorism by the ruling administration. Yes, this film portrays a terrorist as the ""good guy"", but it actually delves deeper into the heart of all of us; and it challenges every one of us to stand up for ourselves BEFORE we would need to resort to acts of violence to safeguard our freedoms - or worse have to reclaim them. Watch this film to be inspired for what we have to loose, before it becomes what we have lost.A final note on Alan Moore not endorsing the film...Moore doesn't endorse any of his works being made into film. But, I would like to think that he will see it and see his vision properly realized; this is what I saw in the film...his vision on screen (though I was disappointed that the musical numbers found in the graphic novel were missing!).

I'll be honest -  the movie would be dull and plodding if it included everything in the second book of the graphic novel. Slow and dreary sideplots do little to add to a film's experience and invariably end up causing viewers to glance at their timepieces.Fortunately, the creators know how to make an entertaining movie while staying true to the spirit of the comic. Hugo Weaving is exemplary as the psychotic yet compassionate terrorist V, and Stephen Fry adds black humour to a depressing film about power-hungry corporatists. The hypocrisy of fascist dictatorships is put on display in all its ugliness. High Chancellor Sutler is not content to refrain from enjoying music he does not approve of. He must also outlaw anything that has offended him or is used as a threat to his rule.The plot is very similar to the movie, with Evey staying at Deitrich's house instead of that of a generous stranger.

The two factors combine to create a movie with a much more ""mainstream"" look than any other comic adaptation I've seen and a much better dramatic flow.First, the story: It's set in the visible future, in an England under some Orwellian regime with a crypto-christian edge. Agents of the regime are above the law, but not above using their power to abuse the rest of the citizenry. Our hero, V, began his the story as a human test animal in some inhuman medical experiment, but came out of it alive - mostly. Now, he's here for revenge against the sadistic crew that ran the test facility, and against the totalitarian regime that supported it. It's hardly a spoiler to say that V gets his revenge.V's mask is about the only real comic-y image in the whole movie. That general sense of reality only strengthens the rest of the movie, including Natalie Portman's (Evie's) imprisonment and the final computer-generated fireworks. There are plenty of surreal elements, though. Except for V's mask and maybe Evie, almost all of the faces are disturbingly asymmetric, as if the twisted faces represented the twisted minds behind them.Maybe the real surprise, if you don't usually read comics, is that V comes from DC, the publisher that created Batman, Superman, and their immediate kin. DC has had the Vertigo line of comics for a long time, intended to hold on to readers who outgrew the super-hero-in-tights genre (that's S-H-I-... never mind). I've enjoyed the Vertigo line, but I admit I haven't read V yet.

I can't stand the need of reviewers to compare films and make each new one an amalgamation of past films. They go on and on about how great they thought those were. I take each movie individually as it comes along. I don't care about who directed it, and what they directed in the past. I believe it does actors and directors an injustice to pull up roles that have nothing to do with the current piece under discussion.I am purely and simply looking for entertainment. Take me away from the worries of modern life and show me something else, escapist entertainment. I should think most people are. I want impossible feats of heroism. I don't care if they're believable or not. I want fantastic heroes that can do things that I can never hope to do. The strong men or women that can ride to the rescue and right the wrongs of modern day life, from the bullies on the playground to the corrupt politicians. I want to see people who fly, and fight, and great car chases, wonderful illogical romances, magic and ESP. That's what entertainment is. It's fiction. Every bit of it is made up in the mind of someone, whether it's a book, play, or movie. The interpretation of that idea is what we see as a final product. Good acting is a must. A good script and good direction are also a requirements.This movie succeeds briliantly in that aim. I was drawn into the story , it took my breath, and my attention until the end credits rolled. V is the mysterious vengeful antihero. I call him that because he's definitely not too sweet. I thought the girl's name Eve, to be telling. The acting was good without being over dramatic. The people that played the roles seemed to fit the roles well. No, I am not going to spoil the movie with a blow by blow account. I believe it's important to view a movie without any prior seeds planted by someone else who liked it or disliked it.If entertainment is your aim then this is a great film. I was absolutely amazed. This was great after all the other garbage that Hollywood has produced, tried to dress up as entertainment, and shove down our throats in the last five years or so. They keep slinging it out despite the steadily declining theater audiences.The plot is not too twisted to grasp easily, even though there are some surprises. There is plenty of action for the action buffs. There is a moral message for the conscientous. There is a very scary political message not even thinly disguised. ""The people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of the people."" There isn't any sex, this movie doesn't need it. There are however a lot of emotions.I cannot for the life of me get over all these arm chair critics. Even though for the most part they've been positive. I don't care what they have to say. I want to see it for myself. That is always my advice. Rent it. Watch it. Like it. Buy it. Don't take my word for it, or that of anyone else. Don't let someone's idea of what a great movie, of what great entertainment should be, make you miss something you might enjoy, or influence you to buy something you will hate. I learned that a long time ago, it remains my practice today. I've never regretted it. I have loved movies that others wouldn't give one star. I have hated with a passion movies that others gave five stars. So rent it and make up your own mind. I've bought my copy of "",V for Vendetta,"" and I've watched it several times already.

Despite what most of the purists may say, Moores original view of totalitarian britain has aged somewhat, and an exacttranslation of the graphic novel onto the silver screen would have been far too esoteric and inaccessable for those who had not been previously introduced to the material. What we have here the is an adaptation of the original concept of the novel, with some of the plot points rearranged and characters redrawn, in order to fit a movie format, and to better explore the intricacies of this fascist police state. Whereas moore portrayed a world where the government is in complete control, both of the nation and the hearts and minds of the citizenry, the Wachowski's have altered this somewhat. What we have now is a government that controls through deception and spin, by creating fear in the populace and presenting Anglo-christian based national socialism as the cure for all ills. This is in contrast to moores vision where the government rules by intimidation and violence, the citizens of britain are brow beaten dogs utterly submissive and incapable of thought, in this movie the populace have simply been kept in the dark and are awaiting someone to turn the light on. Enter V.What makes this film such a triumph is it's assertion that no matter how entrencehd a governments control becomes, there are always going to be people who question them always people who look at the world and sense something is wrong. People know when they're being lied to, know when spin becomes outright lies and are perfectly capable of standing for their own rights. Of course V's attacks act as the catalyst for this process ut the ultimate act of herosim is performed by the public.Yes there are better action films, yes there are better films that question the world we live in, but very few do both with such style and grace. This time the wachowski's managed to of their message without recourse to big black coats and rage against the machine music.

I'll admit that I haven't read the graphic novel, but I don't think that should take away from this film. It's simply brilliant. The idea of a totalitarian government controlling every aspect of people's lives really makes one think of what it really means to be free. The acting is wonderful, with Hugo Weaving perfectly portraying the suave yet menacing character of V. His silky voice and charismatic words make one forget that he is, in fact, a terrorist with the intention of carrying out Guy Fawkes' failed attempt to destroy Parliament in the 1600's. Natalie Portman is great in her role of Evey Hammond, evolving from a cautious everyday woman trying to live her life in peace to a strong-willed woman who learns to overcome her fear. She isn't like most of the female leads in movies like this where she's only a victim caught in the middle of everything. And let's not forget Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch, the skeptical yet determined officer trying to follow V before his threatened attack on Parliament on the 5th of November. The side stories are very interesting and piece the whole plot together in a web of illusioned coincidence. Never before has a movie given me chills the way V For Vendetta did at the very end, and I won't spoil it for those who have yet to see it.

McTeigue certainly knows his craft and manages to use the camera in a manner that is perfectly befitting the content.  The production design is idiosyncratic but also accessible and believable, which further mesmerizes and intrigues.  The script by the Wachowskis further exemplifies their talent: they now how to use words, they know how to use ideas, they know how to build a story.And what a story it is.  I was uncertain how to feel the first time I viewed the film.  Certainly, the movie must breed controversy, and I didn't know which side of that I fell on.  I've come to endorse the film but only after careful reflection.  The issues are contemporary and touchy, but the movie offers enough ambiguity to permit the viewer his own interpretation.  Certainly, one cannot mindlessly interact with this film; only catastrophe could ensue as a result.  Patience and contemplation are required here, and I fear that in the wrong hands, this form of content could be inflammatory.  But then all good art is.There's nothing to complain about with Natalie Portman, but it's a sheer miracle that Hugo Weaving can continuously steel the show from behind a mask--what a voice!  Another component on which I must comment is the use of editing and music.  Dario Marianelli's score is superb, and listen to the way he subtly incorporates Tchaikovsky into the quieter moments!  Scattered throughout the film are several intriguing and wonderful montage sequences that create a marvelous flow to the narrative and are wonderfully accented by the pulse of Marianelli's music.  At times the film makes awkward pauses, the dialogue waxes melodramatic, and the pacing seems forced, but these faults are inconsequential to an overall brilliant film.",5,Everything You've Ever Wanted!,1155600000,"08 15, 2006",2006,1855,"['Here', 'spectacle', 'never', 'disappoint', 'even', 'spite', 'certain', 'imperfections', 'Visually', 'flawless', 'McTeigue', 'certainly', 'craft', 'manages', 'use', 'camera', 'manner', 'perfectly', 'befitting', 'content', 'production', 'design', 'idiosyncratic', 'also', 'accessible', 'believable', 'further', 'mesmerizes', 'intrigues', 'script', 'Wachowskis', 'further', 'exemplifies', 'talent', 'now', 'how', 'use', 'words', 'know', 'how', 'use', 'ideas', 'know', 'how', 'build', 'story.And', 'what', 'story', 'was', 'uncertain', 'how', 'feel', 'first', 'time', 'viewed', 'film', 'Certainly', 'movie', 'must', 'breed', 'controversy', 'did', ""n't"", 'know', 'side', 'fell', ""'ve"", 'come', 'endorse', 'film', 'only', 'careful', 'reflection', 'issues', 'are', 'contemporary', 'touchy', 'movie', 'enough', 'ambiguity', 'permit', 'viewer', 'own', 'interpretation', 'Certainly', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'mindlessly', 'interact', 'film', 'only', 'catastrophe', 'could', 'ensue', 'result', 'Patience', 'contemplation', 'are', 'required', 'here', 'fear', 'wrong', 'hands', 'form', 'content', 'could', 'be', 'inflammatory', 'then', 'good', 'art', 'nothing', 'complain', 'Natalie', 'Portman', 'sheer', 'miracle', 'Hugo', 'Weaving', 'can', 'continuously', 'steel', 'show', 'mask', 'what', 'voice', 'component', 'must', 'comment', 'use', 'editing', 'music', 'Dario', 'Marianelli', 'score', 'superb', 'listen', 'way', 'subtly', 'Tchaikovsky', 'quieter', 'moments', 'Scattered', 'film', 'are', 'several', 'intriguing', 'wonderful', 'montage', 'sequences', 'create', 'marvelous', 'flow', 'narrative', 'are', 'wonderfully', 'accented', 'pulse', 'Marianelli', 'music', 'times', 'film', 'awkward', 'pauses', 'dialogue', 'waxes', 'melodramatic', 'pacing', 'forced', 'faults', 'are', 'inconsequential', 'overall', 'brilliant', 'film']",N/A
176721,AFZNJHDGE0DUJ,1419838830,Zadius Sky,"[6, 8]","Some time ago, I watched ""V for Vendetta"" soon after it came out on DVD.  At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable.  This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the ""Matrix"" trilogy, which is one of my treasures. These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality.  If you look closely to these films, you will see the underlying messages as relating to our current situations.  While both ""Matrix"" and ""V for Vendetta"" presented the theme of control, ""V for Vendetta"" is the best presented as a government's control of the people.  This film brought about the idea of how media is being controlled to keep the people 'asleep' or unaware of government or of dictator's doings.  The common people portrayed in this film did not see how controlled they are until the up-lifting appearance of a character named ""V.""In my humble opinion, I highly recommended this movie.",5,Most Recommended!,1194048000,"11 3, 2007",2007,960,"['time', 'watched', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'soon', 'came', 'out', 'DVD', 'first', 'viewing', 'felt', 'film', 'quite', 'remarkable', 'remarkable', 'film', 'was', 'created', 'Wachowski', 'brothers', 'whom', 'also', 'created', 'Matrix', 'trilogy', 'one', 'treasures', 'films', 'are', 'gifts', 'humanity', 'provided', 'wonderful', 'yet', 'strong', 'analogy', 'reality', 'look', 'closely', 'films', 'will', 'see', 'underlying', 'messages', 'relating', 'current', 'situations', 'Matrix', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'presented', 'theme', 'control', 'V', 'Vendetta', 'best', 'presented', 'government', 'control', 'people', 'film', 'brought', 'idea', 'how', 'media', 'being', 'controlled', 'keep', 'people', ""'asleep"", 'unaware', 'government', 'dictator', 'doings', 'common', 'people', 'portrayed', 'film', 'did', 'not', 'see', 'how', 'controlled', 'are', 'up-lifting', 'appearance', 'character', 'named', 'V.', 'humble', 'opinion', 'highly', 'recommended', 'movie']",N/A
