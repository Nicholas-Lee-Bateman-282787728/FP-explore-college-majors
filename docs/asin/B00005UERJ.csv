683967,AR3RAD2DPXBRN,B00005UERJ,Christopher Farrell,"[28, 33]","First off, let me say that there is a lot of content in this DVD about Tolkien's influences, and this is a tremendous help in thinking about The Lord of the Rings. WWI, WWII, Beowulf, and the Kalevala were all important influences, and like most literature, the Lord of the Rings can be somewhat mysterious without knowing about it's cultural groundings. As such, this video will be of tremendous value for the uninitiated.My frustration with this video stems from the fact that it mentions a number of these connections, tourbook style, without exploring any of them in any depth. For example, the video mentions Beowulf as an influence, but fails to explain *what* it influences or where you can find its signature in Lord of the Rings. It mentions Tolkien's experience in World War I, but fails to explain *how* it influenced his work. And it also fails to look more than superfically at the complex relationship between Lord of the Rings and WWII (yes, Tolkien denied that the Lord of the Rings was an allegory for WWII, but was very careful not to say that the Lord of the Rings was not influenced by or not applicable to WWII).Additionally, I feel National Geographic has hijacked the Lord of the Rings for some of their favorite causes in this video. There is a very long segment on the Kalevala which never touches on its revelance to Tolkien, but does tell us that languages are dying out and they should be saved as they have cultural significance. Doubtless true. There is another long and melodramtic piece at the end, which compares an environmentalist's 1000-mile trek through Africa to get some publicity for the flora and fauna endangered by man's activities to the journey of Frodo, which seemed a little grandiose to me (whether or not there were hordes of armed men trying to kill him, or whether he ran any serious risks at all, is not mentioned). The thing is, while the Lord of the Rings certainly preaches the good of the natural world, environmentalism is not one of it's root values in my opinion (the mining, manufacturing, worldly-good-obsessed Dwarves are stalwart good guys whom Sauron could not corrupt, after all. None of the book on Tolkien that I've read have seriously mentioned environmentalism as a theme in the same was as they have for, say, Stephen R. Donaldson's Covenant books). Alan Lee ends the DVD with a pitch for saving the environment and ending war by asking ""who will be the ring-bearer?"".Despite the apparent obviousness of the Good vs. Evil and Evil vs. Nature themes, Tolkein's work is one of amazing depth and subtelty and to try to apply such black-and-white interpretations does not do the book (or movie!) a service. Frodo would never have made it 10 miles without his friends, the Fellowship, the gifts of Galadriel and Bilbo, the hospitality of Elrond, Faramir and Tom Bombadil, or the sacrifice of Gollum (just to pick a few); not to mention that he rose to the challenge of a task thrust upon him. To apply such simplistic metaphors to a work of the depth of the Lord of the Rings is dangerous.Now, it may sound like I'm coming down pretty hard on the video, and it's true that it could have been a heck of a lot better. However, despite these flaws, the video is still quite a good introduction to Tolkien's influences. However, I highly recommend you follow it up with a read of T.A. Shippey's excellent and highly readable ""J.R.R. Tolkien : Author of the Century"". It is everything this video is not, and it really explores Tolkien's influences and themes in some depth.",3,"Interesting, but not enough depth",1014595200,"02 25, 2002",2002,3533,"['First', 'off', 'let', 'say', 'lot', 'content', 'DVD', 'Tolkien', 'influences', 'tremendous', 'help', 'thinking', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'WWI', 'WWII', 'Beowulf', 'Kalevala', 'were', 'important', 'influences', 'most', 'literature', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'mysterious', 'knowing', 'cultural', 'groundings', 'such', 'video', 'will', 'be', 'tremendous', 'value', 'uninitiated.My', 'frustration', 'video', 'fact', 'number', 'connections', 'tourbook', 'style', 'exploring', 'depth', 'example', 'video', 'mentions', 'Beowulf', 'influence', 'explain', '*what*', 'where', 'can', 'find', 'signature', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Tolkien', 'experience', 'World', 'War', 'explain', '*how*', 'influenced', 'work', 'also', 'look', 'more', 'superfically', 'complex', 'relationship', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'WWII', 'yes', 'Tolkien', 'denied', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'allegory', 'WWII', 'was', 'very', 'careful', 'not', 'say', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'was', 'not', 'influenced', 'not', 'applicable', 'WWII', '.Additionally', 'feel', 'National', 'Geographic', 'hijacked', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'favorite', 'causes', 'video', 'very', 'long', 'segment', 'Kalevala', 'never', 'revelance', 'Tolkien', 'tell', 'languages', 'are', 'dying', 'out', 'should', 'be', 'saved', 'have', 'cultural', 'significance', 'Doubtless', 'true', 'long', 'melodramtic', 'piece', 'end', 'environmentalist', '1000-mile', 'trek', 'Africa', 'get', 'publicity', 'flora', 'fauna', 'endangered', 'man', 'activities', 'journey', 'Frodo', 'seemed', 'little', 'grandiose', 'not', 'were', 'hordes', 'armed', 'men', 'trying', 'kill', 'ran', 'serious', 'risks', 'not', 'mentioned', 'thing', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'certainly', 'good', 'natural', 'world', 'environmentalism', 'not', 'one', 'root', 'values', 'opinion', 'mining', 'manufacturing', 'worldly-good-obsessed', 'Dwarves', 'are', 'stalwart', 'good', 'guys', 'whom', 'Sauron', 'could', 'not', 'corrupt', 'None', 'book', 'Tolkien', ""'ve"", 'read', 'have', 'seriously', 'mentioned', 'environmentalism', 'theme', 'same', 'was', 'have', 'say', 'Stephen', 'R.', 'Donaldson', 'Covenant', 'books', 'Alan', 'Lee', 'DVD', 'pitch', 'saving', 'environment', 'ending', 'war', 'asking', 'who', 'will', 'be', 'ring-bearer', '.Despite', 'apparent', 'obviousness', 'Good', 'vs', 'Evil', 'Evil', 'vs', 'Nature', 'themes', 'Tolkein', 'work', 'one', 'amazing', 'depth', 'subtelty', 'try', 'apply', 'such', 'black-and-white', 'interpretations', 'not', 'do', 'book', 'movie', 'service', 'Frodo', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'made', '10', 'miles', 'friends', 'Fellowship', 'gifts', 'Galadriel', 'Bilbo', 'hospitality', 'Elrond', 'Faramir', 'Tom', 'Bombadil', 'sacrifice', 'Gollum', 'just', 'pick', 'few', 'not', 'mention', 'rose', 'challenge', 'task', 'thrust', 'apply', 'such', 'simplistic', 'metaphors', 'work', 'depth', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'dangerous.Now', 'may', 'sound', ""'m"", 'coming', 'down', 'pretty', 'hard', 'video', 'true', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'heck', 'lot', 'better', 'However', 'flaws', 'video', 'still', 'quite', 'good', 'introduction', 'Tolkien', 'influences', 'However', 'highly', 'recommend', 'follow', 'up', 'read', 'T.A', 'Shippey', 'excellent', 'highly', 'readable', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'Author', 'Century', 'everything', 'video', 'not', 'really', 'Tolkien', 'influences', 'themes', 'depth']",National Geographic Beyond the Movie - The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring VHS

There is quite a bit about the life of J.R.R. Tolkien- His childhood, the area where he grew up (Which would eventually serve as the inspiration for The Shire), and his horrific experiences in World War I (The Lord of the Rings was first written about in a journal Tolkien kept in the trenches). In true National Geographic fashion, there is also a great deal of information about the Anglo-Saxon history and folktales that may have inspired Tolkien, as well as an incredibly fascinating piece about the Finnish language inspiring his creation of the Elvish tongues. The segnent about The Kalavala (an epic Finnish poem) was truly moving.The only drawback I have about recommending the DVD is the price: The visuals are great (Which is to be expected from National Geographic), and the content is absorbing, but I think the price is a tad high for a mere 53 minutes of program, and a few trailers for other National Geographic products.

683970,A2MW0RYIXMEYGS,B00005UERJ,Dave,"[14, 30]","As a true Tolkien fan, I can safely say that almost every review on this website that proclaims this feature bad is entirely CORRECT. The only reason you would want to buy this production is for some film footage, and snippets from some cast interviews, which could very well be included in the behind-the-scenes stuff on the Fellowship of the Ring extended edition DVD.At one point, they show a film clip of the Fellowship beginning to kick some orc-rear in Moria, and right after the cave-troll takes a whack at Sam, we cut to images of tanks, and railroads, and industrial machinery, as the narrator talks of Tolkien&#65533;s experiences with war, and how industrial progress was portrayed in the novels as the Dark Lord Sauron. There are several other times where the documentary infers this. Was there symbolism like this in Lord of the Rings? Yes, some. Was Mordor supposed to represent industry, and machines? Do the novels contain a &#65533;Save-the-Earth, hug-a-tree&#65533; message? Not really. Tolkien was a conservationist of sorts, but he would spin in his grave to learn of the things National Geographic said.Towards the end of the feature, they discuss the language that Tolkien based Elvish upon, the language of the Kalevanas, and National Geographic just can&#65533;t help veering 180 degrees away from Lord of the Rings in order to focus on the failing culture there, a failed attempt to compare the peoples of then to the peoples of Middle-Earth.So, overall, I&#65533;d say that this isn&#65533;t worth buying, unless it&#65533;s included in a package like the extended edition gift set, which, as I said, is the only reason I saw this.To National Geographic's credit, on the DVD, there&#65533;s some extra material regarding the Inklings, the writers&#65533; group Tolkien was a member of. It mentions Tolkien&#65533;s CHRISTIANITY, and his friendship with C.S. Lewis. Here you can find some valuable information about the two, and the group itself. Otherwise, there is zero mention of the impact that Christianity had on his life.Take my advice, Tolkien fans: PLEASE don&#65533;t buy this!",1,I can't rate it low enough,1052006400,"05 4, 2003",2003,2112,"['true', 'Tolkien', 'fan', 'can', 'safely', 'say', 'almost', 'review', 'website', 'feature', 'bad', 'entirely', 'CORRECT', 'only', 'reason', 'would', 'want', 'buy', 'production', 'film', 'footage', 'snippets', 'cast', 'interviews', 'could', 'very', 'well', 'be', 'included', 'behind-the-scenes', 'stuff', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'extended', 'edition', 'DVD.At', 'one', 'point', 'show', 'film', 'clip', 'Fellowship', 'beginning', 'kick', 'orc-rear', 'Moria', 'right', 'cave-troll', 'whack', 'Sam', 'cut', 'images', 'tanks', 'railroads', 'industrial', 'machinery', 'narrator', 'talks', 'Tolkien', '65533', 's', 'experiences', 'war', 'how', 'industrial', 'progress', 'was', 'portrayed', 'novels', 'Dark', 'Lord', 'Sauron', 'are', 'several', 'other', 'times', 'where', 'documentary', 'infers', 'Was', 'there', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'Yes', 'Was', 'Mordor', 'supposed', 'represent', 'industry', 'machines', 'Do', 'novels', 'contain', '65533', 'Save-the-Earth', 'hug-a-tree', '65533', 'message', 'Not', 'really', 'Tolkien', 'was', 'conservationist', 'sorts', 'would', 'spin', 'grave', 'learn', 'things', 'National', 'Geographic', 'end', 'feature', 'discuss', 'language', 'Tolkien', 'based', 'Elvish', 'language', 'Kalevanas', 'National', 'Geographic', 'just', 'can', '65533', 't', 'help', 'veering', '180', 'degrees', 'away', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'order', 'focus', 'failing', 'culture', 'there', 'failed', 'attempt', 'compare', 'peoples', 'then', 'peoples', 'Middle-Earth.So', 'overall', '65533', 'd', 'say', 'isn', '65533', 't', 'buying', '65533', 's', 'included', 'package', 'extended', 'edition', 'gift', 'set', 'said', 'only', 'reason', 'saw', 'this.To', 'National', 'Geographic', 'credit', 'DVD', '65533', 'extra', 'material', 'regarding', 'Inklings', 'writers', '65533', 'group', 'Tolkien', 'was', 'member', 'Tolkien', '65533', 's', 'CHRISTIANITY', 'friendship', 'C.S', 'Lewis', 'Here', 'can', 'find', 'valuable', 'information', 'two', 'group', 'Otherwise', 'zero', 'mention', 'impact', 'Christianity', 'had', 'life.Take', 'advice', 'Tolkien', 'fans', 'PLEASE', 'don', '65533', 't', 'buy']",National Geographic Beyond the Movie - The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring VHS

In his &quot;Letters&quot; he stated quite clearly that while there was certainly &quot;applicability&quot; between his writing and events in the 20th century, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; was NOT meant to tell the same story.  While the care of the environment was important to Tolkien, he was not an environmentalist as that word is now commonly used.

As it is, it is flawed and mediocre, with some bright bits. Unfortunately, heavy-handed messages sometimes take over the narrative, rather than allowing us to hear about Tolkien and LOTR.The first half is pretty good. We hear a basic outline of the premise, stuff about the hobbits and Middle-Earth and the making of the movie -- including clips from Jackson, Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, and Sean Astin. We also hear about some of the things that shaped Tolkien's experiences for LOTR, such as his fighting in WWI and the destruction of little rural communities when he was a child. Also some production stuff, such as the descriptions of creating Hobbiton and Orlando Bloom waxing eloquent about his long-knives.But then the documentary starts to unravel. We hear about the Kalevala - but hardly anything about how it affected Elvish. Lots of preachiness about the vanishing languages of the world, followed by a giant tract about modern enviromentalism, which gives the feel of a modern P.C. spin.Very little about the heroes in the story is mentioned - they talk vaguely about Frodo, but literally nothing about Sam! How far would Frodo have gotten without Sam? Two miles? Three?  Tolkien's religion was another great shaping force on LOTR, yet it doesn't get a word. Why not cut the tree-hugger monologue and include something about the moral structure of Middle-Earth, or the theological hierarchy? It's only one of the ways in which this documentary approaches Tolkien's work ALL WRONG.However... if you are in withdrawal for PJ's live-action film, and can't wait for the DVD release next summer, then you might want this. It includes some great footage from the film (and one or two snippets of Two Towers): We see Legolas receiving his Lothlorien bow, the ""fiery letters"" scene, just about everything in the birthday party, the adorable ""ask Rosie for a dance!"" Frodo-Sam interaction, and Gandalf's first scene.Overall, watch this if you don't mind a deadly-dull second half after a delightful first half, and some irrelevent stuff after hearing about the movie production.",3,"Stick to Tolkien, please",1015200000,"03 4, 2002",2002,2201,"[""'d"", 'clung', 'subject', 'material', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'GREAT', 'documentary', 'flawed', 'mediocre', 'bright', 'bits', 'Unfortunately', 'heavy-handed', 'messages', 'sometimes', 'take', 'over', 'narrative', 'rather', 'allowing', 'hear', 'Tolkien', 'LOTR.The', 'first', 'half', 'pretty', 'good', 'hear', 'basic', 'outline', 'premise', 'stuff', 'hobbits', 'Middle-Earth', 'making', 'movie', 'including', 'clips', 'Jackson', 'Elijah', 'Wood', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'Billy', 'Boyd', 'Ian', 'McKellen', 'Liv', 'Tyler', 'Sean', 'Astin', 'also', 'hear', 'things', 'shaped', 'Tolkien', 'experiences', 'LOTR', 'such', 'fighting', 'WWI', 'destruction', 'little', 'rural', 'communities', 'when', 'was', 'child', 'Also', 'production', 'stuff', 'such', 'descriptions', 'creating', 'Hobbiton', 'Orlando', 'Bloom', 'waxing', 'eloquent', 'long-knives.But', 'then', 'documentary', 'unravel', 'hear', 'Kalevala', 'hardly', 'anything', 'how', 'affected', 'Elvish', 'Lots', 'preachiness', 'vanishing', 'languages', 'world', 'followed', 'giant', 'tract', 'modern', 'enviromentalism', 'feel', 'modern', 'P.C', 'spin.Very', 'little', 'heroes', 'story', 'mentioned', 'talk', 'vaguely', 'Frodo', 'literally', 'nothing', 'Sam', 'How', 'far', 'would', 'Frodo', 'have', 'gotten', 'Sam', 'Two', 'miles', 'Three', 'Tolkien', 'religion', 'was', 'great', 'shaping', 'force', 'LOTR', 'yet', ""n't"", 'get', 'word', 'Why', 'not', 'cut', 'tree-hugger', 'monologue', 'include', 'something', 'moral', 'structure', 'Middle-Earth', 'theological', 'hierarchy', 'only', 'one', 'ways', 'documentary', 'Tolkien', 'work', 'ALL', 'WRONG.However', 'are', 'withdrawal', 'PJ', 'live-action', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'DVD', 'release', 'next', 'summer', 'then', 'might', 'want', 'great', 'footage', 'film', 'one', 'two', 'snippets', 'Two', 'Towers', 'see', 'Legolas', 'receiving', 'Lothlorien', 'bow', 'fiery', 'letters', 'scene', 'just', 'everything', 'birthday', 'party', 'adorable', 'ask', 'Rosie', 'dance', 'Frodo-Sam', 'interaction', 'Gandalf', 'first', 'scene.Overall', 'watch', 'do', ""n't"", 'mind', 'deadly-dull', 'second', 'half', 'delightful', 'first', 'half', 'irrelevent', 'stuff', 'hearing', 'movie', 'production']",National Geographic Beyond the Movie - The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring VHS

The first part is quite interesting and informative, but it truly deals little with the actual movie, other than with limited actor interviews. It is more the story of JRR Tolkien's original work. Maybe that's what they mean by beyond the movie, but if that was the case I would have preferred that the movie not be mentioned in the title.Historically the information on the time period and how it may have affected the Lord of the Rings series was useful. The parts dealing with the verbal traditions of Finland were enjoyable.What really hurt this DVD was the stretch from the adventures in Middle Earth to the trek across Africa by J. Michael Faye, which really struck me as self promotion. I understand The National Geographic Society had an important part in the &quot;Megatransect&quot;  and featured it many times in various media. But they failed convince me that there was a strong connection between that and LOTR.Overall, I did not feel that this DVD offered appropriate value in return for my money.

It is interesting to learn about Tolkien's life and experiences, which do seem to have influenced his writing.  The Shire as the idealised rural England of his boyhood, the Hobbits representing the worthy people among whom he grew up, his attempt to ""give the English back their mythology"", and the effect of his experiences in the First World War, these are not really open to dispute. The DVD does a good job of looking particularly at Anglo-Saxon and Finnish roots for Tolkien'' vision, even if these are not covered in great depth. In fact the material generally is on the simple side, but it isn't simplistic. The attempt to link in the Second World War is a bit annoying - the voice-over admits that Tolkien, while he was writing during that war, denied any parallels or allegories with it, but at the same time shows lots of Hitler/Sauron, Germans/Orcs, British/good guys imagery. And the ending section, with someone trekkiung (""questing"") across Africa is one of the most obvious pieces of filler I've seen.

Well...sort of.It gives us some information (precious little) about the life and times of J.R.R. Tolkien - but nothing much that we did not all ready know: he fought in World War I, he was from the English countryside and was not a fan of industrialization, he was educated and taught at Oxford, etc.Some insight is provided into the historical aspect of the Trilogy.  Tolkien was heavily influenced by Beowulf and Anglo-Saxon history.  Most illuminating was the discussion of the Nordic Kalevala, and the possible roots of Elvish.  (For all you MST 3K fans out there, the Kalevala is the source of the Sampo).Where I feel the documentary went wrong is that there is not enough of such material.  Instead, it comes off as too much of a plug for the movie The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is chock full of interviews with Peter Jackson and the cast and would certainly be at home as an extra on the DVD.  It also tries to justify its existence by providing parallels between themes in the book (like nature conservation) and our world today.Unfortunately, we live in a time when we seem to be at war every other year.

If you're looking for a behind-the-scenes dvd about the blockbuster movies by Peter Jackson, then you might want to turn off this DVD after the first ten minutes and pick up a Fellowship of the Rings boxed set.This documentary fulfills its claim of going beyond the movie.  It certainly does!  This dvd goes beyond even the works of Tolkien and centers around the author's life and influences.  If you're interested in languages and history, you might find sections of the DVD fascinating as National Geographics takes us to places like Finland and spends what seemed to me to be ages talking to people about language and myths.I'm not really a linguist, nor am I a historian interested in Norse mythology, but I am quite intersted in Tolkien and the things that influenced his works.  For these reasons, I found this DVD to be filled with a wealth of information that goes beyond the shallow tv-style approach to movie backgrounds.  This DVD explores several possible influences on the Lord of the Rings trilogy ranging from foxholes in World War II to epic poems such as Beowulf.  It was very interesting to see how historians and archeologists can shed light on modern fantasy novels and can influence our interpretations of the events within them.I do have a few detractions for this DVD.  It is true that when I purchased it, I expected more of a behind-the-scenes look at the films by Peter Jackson, and I think the cover and description is somewhat misleading in this way.  I was surprised, and not unpleasantly, by the content, but some of the sections discussing language seemed to drag on for a while and leave the audience behind.If you're a Tolkien addict, check out this DVD.

Some of the things presented in this production are contradicted by other sources - mainly about JRR's war experiences influencing the books.  The section about ""modern day Frodos"" was a bit over the top for me, getting a little too ""tree hugger-ish"" for the over all theme.  The sections about the loss of language and oral history was interesting, but I still felt like I was being preached to.There are other DVDs available through Amazon.com which cover Tolkien's life and works rather well, but this is the only work to really touch on Peter Jackson's film.The video quality was excellent, seeing clips from the movie makes me anxious for the DVD to be released.  There's even some snippets from the next two films.  I would have liked to see more of the 'Making of' and cast interviews and less of the 'horros of tropical deforestation'  this is not the place for that sort of material.

The special is basically just an hour of Tolkiens Inspirations for writing the books, there really wasn't any real focus on the movie.The problem with this dvd is that it really has no substance. By that I mean that the feature really doesn't have much to go on. For example, Tolkiens inspiration for the Elvish language in the film comes from a dying language from a foriegn 3rd world country (i forget the name), but the feature spends about a good 15 minutes on a segment about this one really old man who lives alone in the middle of nowhere and sings songs in this language. I was like ""who cares, what does this realy have to do with the movie?"" I would understand them mentioning it for a few minutes, but to dwell 20-25 on just the language (which is about the only thing NG did it's homework on) is a clear sign they were trying to kill time.The segment on WW1 and tolkiens inspirations for the book was intresting at first but didn't go beyond mindless babble spending a significant amount of time saying the same thing. They really didn't dig up any good stuff on Tolkien for this thing.The dvd then just goes on showing short clips of the movie and talking pretty much about locations and such, but nothingn that we haven't heard before or even really care about. Even the ""special features"" section was just more segment on tolkiens inspriations, that were decent,and that should have been put in the regular feature in place of most of the useless stuff.It's obvious that National Geographic really wanted to put out some kind of LOTR feature but really didn't dig up enough useful information for it, so they hacked some hour long segment together real quick just to make a few bucks. The $21.50 price is a tad cheaper then most dvds but that is way too high a price to charge for such a mediocre feature. I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 just because it starts pretty well, but drops after the first 15 minutes. Also, a couple of the special feature segments were a bit interesting. Save your money unless you're some die-hard LOTR fan, but even then I'm sure you'll be dissappointed by its lack of effort for such an amazing film as LOTR.",2,Boring,1039305600,"12 8, 2002",2002,2221,"['really', ""n't"", 'best', 'National', 'Geographic', 'feature', 'there', 'special', 'basically', 'just', 'hour', 'Tolkiens', 'Inspirations', 'writing', 'books', 'really', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'focus', 'movie.The', 'problem', 'dvd', 'really', 'substance', 'mean', 'feature', 'really', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'go', 'example', 'Tolkiens', 'inspiration', 'Elvish', 'language', 'film', 'dying', 'language', 'foriegn', '3rd', 'world', 'country', 'i', 'forget', 'name', 'feature', 'good', '15', 'minutes', 'segment', 'one', 'really', 'old', 'man', 'who', 'alone', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'sings', 'songs', 'language', 'was', 'who', 'what', 'realy', 'have', 'do', 'movie', 'would', 'understand', 'mentioning', 'few', 'minutes', 'dwell', '20-25', 'just', 'language', 'only', 'thing', 'NG', 'did', 'homework', 'clear', 'sign', 'were', 'trying', 'kill', 'time.The', 'segment', 'WW1', 'tolkiens', 'inspirations', 'book', 'was', 'intresting', 'first', 'did', ""n't"", 'go', 'mindless', 'babble', 'spending', 'significant', 'amount', 'time', 'saying', 'same', 'thing', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'dig', 'up', 'good', 'stuff', 'Tolkien', 'thing.The', 'dvd', 'then', 'just', 'showing', 'short', 'clips', 'movie', 'talking', 'pretty', 'much', 'locations', 'such', 'nothingn', 'have', ""n't"", 'heard', 'even', 'really', 'care', 'Even', 'special', 'features', 'section', 'was', 'just', 'more', 'segment', 'tolkiens', 'inspriations', 'were', 'decent', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'put', 'regular', 'feature', 'place', 'most', 'useless', 'stuff.It', 'obvious', 'National', 'Geographic', 'really', 'wanted', 'put', 'out', 'kind', 'LOTR', 'feature', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'dig', 'up', 'enough', 'useful', 'information', 'hacked', 'hour', 'long', 'segment', 'together', 'real', 'quick', 'just', 'make', 'few', 'bucks', '21.50', 'price', 'tad', 'cheaper', 'then', 'most', 'dvds', 'way', 'too', 'high', 'price', 'charge', 'such', 'mediocre', 'feature', 'gave', '2', 'stars', 'instead', '1', 'just', 'pretty', 'well', 'drops', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'Also', 'couple', 'special', 'feature', 'segments', 'were', 'bit', 'interesting', 'Save', 'money', ""'re"", 'die-hard', 'LOTR', 'fan', 'even', 'then', ""'m"", 'sure', ""'ll"", 'be', 'dissappointed', 'lack', 'effort', 'such', 'amazing', 'film', 'LOTR']",National Geographic Beyond the Movie - The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring VHS

Though the video has a strong ecological and environmental message (it's a National Geographical piece after all), the video does much more than examine the conservationism of Tolkien. In fact, the main purpose of the video is not environmentalism, but an examination of how the fantasy world of Middle Earth that Tolkien created was rooted in the realities of our own world.Tolkien strongly stated several times throughout his life that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was not a modernist fable or allegory about the World Wars or Industrialism vs. Agriculture or anything like that. THE LORD OF THE RINGS is simply a story; one of the greatest and most detailed fictional stories of all time perhaps, but a story nonetheless. However, THE LORD OF THE RINGS was influenced by all that had affected Tolkien in his life. This special illustrates how some of those events inspired THE LORD OF THE RINGS: how the rural agricultural area where Tolkien was raised helped inspire the Shire; how WWI influenced Tolkien's view and description of the War of the Ring; how the endangered Finnish language helped Tolkien create the Elvish language.The tape includes interviews with lots of people including one of Tolkien's remaining living friends, Tolkien scholars, linguistic experts, anthropologists, environmentalists, actors on the set of THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and even Peter Jackson himself. There is quite a bit of archival footage (for a 60 minute tape) and there are also a few snippets from scenes of the two remaining THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies to be released.The documentary went into a great detail discussing how various elements and events affected Tolkien's grand epic. However, there was one very important part of Tolkien's life that affected THE LORD OF THE RINGS, that the video did not even mention. The tape does not mention anything at all about Tolkien's devout Christian faith. Though Tolkien firmly stated that THE LORD OF THE RINGS was not a Christian allegory (like many of the writings of his good friend C.S. Lewis), he never denied that his faith played a role in what he wrote and how he wrote it. Tolkien's faith was the most important part of his life and to not even acknowledge the importance it played is shameful.Overall an enjoyable special great for any THE LORD OF THE RINGS fan, Tolkien fan, and anyone interested in learning more about J.R.R.

I mind this incompleteness less, though than the two detours which the film takes.
