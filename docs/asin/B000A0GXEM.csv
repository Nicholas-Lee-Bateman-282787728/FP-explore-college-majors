918006,A2B4Y78QXQ3G7K,B000A0GXEM,Astrid (Lunches Fit For a Kid),"[33, 34]","I just did The Method: Cardio Flex Band Workout. Wow! I feel WORKED, and it was only 35 minutes.  NOTE - I am 5 months pregnant, but active.  I think this would be an awesome workout for anyone.There were 2 people besides the instructor doing the workout, and they were very quiet. Just there for the demonstration, not for conversation. One of them showed lower impact moves if the instructor went into high impact.The instructor (I think her name is Cindy Fox) has a pretty thick New York accent that I found distracting at first, but I got over it pretty quickly, once the workout got going. I also got over the pink tones in the set and the pink accented workout clothes. I really really hate pink, so that was a hard one. Plus, the bands they used are bright pale green, so that was also a bit jarring to the eye.Onto the workout:Started with a Warm-up which did a good job of stretching and warming up my body.Went onto what they called a Lower Body workout, though it mostly worked my shoulders. I guess there was some background strengthening in the lower body, but MAN - the shoulder exercises were crazy good. I like that, because my shoulders are not the strongest part of my body.Next came the Upper Body which was mostly biceps and triceps, though it incorporated some lunges in it, too. Very good!Then came a short Low Impact Aerobics section, without the band. This incorporated the mambo and cha cha, and in a way that didn't confuse me or make me fall flat on my face. It wasn't too challenging for aerobics-inept me, but got my heart pumping, so I would say it was very effective.Back to the band!! The Back, Shoulders & Hips came next, and it was very good. There was a part where you tie the band in a knot and use it around your ankles like a rubber band to do some hip/leg exercises. Nice. Some of them needed some balance to do, and even big pregnant me didn't fall over, so I guess the balance I have been practicing in yoga is good!!The band went away for the rest of the workout... Abs with Jabs and Punches came next. It was a good standing ab workout, which I like, since I can't lie down!! You also work your arms with some punches and jabs, and your legs with some mini-squats (""under the rope""). Overall, good.The Cooldown/Stretch was also really good. One thing I liked is that they include a hip stretch, which I can always use. My hips get tight really easily. And I never remember to stretch them on my own!!!!Anyhow, if you have an exercise band, and don't know quite what to do with it, this workout is a really good one. Not too long, and both tones and gets some cardio in. I was sweating by the end, andI know my shoulders will feel this later!! PLUS - no lying down, so I could do the whole workout. (You are not supposed to exercise on your back after the first trimester of pregnancy.)Recommended!!!:)",4,Feels great!!!,1137283200,"01 15, 2006",2006,2844,"['just', 'did', 'Method', 'Cardio', 'Flex', 'Band', 'Workout', 'Wow', 'feel', 'WORKED', 'was', 'only', '35', 'minutes', 'NOTE', 'am', '5', 'months', 'pregnant', 'active', 'think', 'would', 'be', 'awesome', 'workout', 'anyone.There', 'were', '2', 'people', 'instructor', 'doing', 'workout', 'were', 'very', 'quiet', 'Just', 'demonstration', 'not', 'conversation', 'One', 'showed', 'lower', 'impact', 'moves', 'instructor', 'went', 'high', 'impact.The', 'instructor', 'think', 'name', 'Cindy', 'Fox', 'pretty', 'thick', 'New', 'York', 'accent', 'found', 'distracting', 'first', 'got', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'once', 'workout', 'got', 'going', 'also', 'got', 'pink', 'tones', 'set', 'pink', 'accented', 'workout', 'clothes', 'really', 'really', 'hate', 'pink', 'was', 'hard', 'one', 'bands', 'used', 'are', 'bright', 'pale', 'green', 'was', 'also', 'bit', 'jarring', 'eye.Onto', 'workout', 'Started', 'Warm-up', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'stretching', 'warming', 'up', 'body.Went', 'what', 'called', 'Lower', 'Body', 'workout', 'mostly', 'worked', 'shoulders', 'guess', 'was', 'background', 'strengthening', 'lower', 'body', 'MAN', 'shoulder', 'exercises', 'were', 'crazy', 'good', 'shoulders', 'are', 'not', 'strongest', 'part', 'body.Next', 'came', 'Upper', 'Body', 'was', 'mostly', 'biceps', 'triceps', 'incorporated', 'lunges', 'too', 'Very', 'good', 'Then', 'came', 'short', 'Low', 'Impact', 'Aerobics', 'section', 'band', 'incorporated', 'mambo', 'cha', 'cha', 'way', 'did', ""n't"", 'confuse', 'make', 'fall', 'flat', 'face', 'was', ""n't"", 'too', 'challenging', 'aerobics-inept', 'got', 'heart', 'pumping', 'would', 'say', 'was', 'very', 'effective.Back', 'band', 'Back', 'Shoulders', 'Hips', 'came', 'next', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'was', 'part', 'where', 'tie', 'band', 'knot', 'use', 'ankles', 'rubber', 'band', 'do', 'hip/leg', 'exercises', 'Nice', 'needed', 'balance', 'do', 'even', 'big', 'did', ""n't"", 'fall', 'over', 'so', 'guess', 'balance', 'have', 'been', 'practicing', 'yoga', 'good', 'band', 'went', 'away', 'rest', 'workout', 'Abs', 'Jabs', 'Punches', 'came', 'next', 'was', 'good', 'standing', 'ab', 'workout', 'like', 'ca', ""n't"", 'lie', 'down', 'also', 'work', 'arms', 'punches', 'jabs', 'legs', 'mini-squats', 'rope', 'Overall', 'good.The', 'Cooldown/Stretch', 'was', 'also', 'really', 'good', 'One', 'thing', 'liked', 'include', 'hip', 'stretch', 'can', 'always', 'use', 'hips', 'get', 'tight', 'really', 'easily', 'never', 'remember', 'stretch', 'own', 'Anyhow', 'have', 'exercise', 'band', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'quite', 'what', 'do', 'workout', 'really', 'good', 'one', 'Not', 'too', 'long', 'tones', 'cardio', 'was', 'sweating', 'end', 'andI', 'know', 'shoulders', 'will', 'feel', 'later', 'PLUS', 'lying', 'down', 'could', 'do', 'whole', 'workout', 'are', 'not', 'supposed', 'exercise', 'back', 'first', 'trimester', 'pregnancy.', 'Recommended']",The Method: Cardio Flex Band Workout
