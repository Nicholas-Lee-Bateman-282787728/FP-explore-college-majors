757679,A28MYC8KKCK2FZ,B00009V7PY,Alice L. Moore,"[2, 2]","This is a 4 part dvd that can be made as an at home fitness program.  It has 4 parts the thighs, arms, gluteal muscles, and abs.  There are 3 settings Basic, Regular, and Challenge.  Everyone from a beginner to a long time exerciser can start right at once.  You can do one part or all 4 parts.  I,personally, have found this helpful alternating this with Leslie Sansone'sLeslie Sansone - Fat Burning Walk Deluxe Edition (Fat Burner Walk 2 Miles / Fat Burning Walk 4 Miles)every other day.  Of course there's the ultimate proof that it does help(at least myself) with weight loss, stress relief, and blood pressure.  You don't need a Nautilus, only two sets of hand weights.The main issue I have with this dvd is that the warm up routines are too dancy(I can't think of a better word).  Modification is necessary for myself.If someone were starting an exercise program; this dvd is a good start.  For the long time fitness buff, this can be used on recovery days.",4,A good part of an at home fitness program,1243382400,"05 27, 2009",2009,963,"['4', 'part', 'dvd', 'can', 'be', 'made', 'home', 'fitness', 'program', '4', 'parts', 'thighs', 'arms', 'gluteal', 'muscles', 'abs', 'are', '3', 'settings', 'Basic', 'Regular', 'Challenge', 'Everyone', 'beginner', 'long', 'time', 'exerciser', 'can', 'start', 'right', 'once', 'can', 'do', 'one', 'part', '4', 'parts', 'personally', 'have', 'found', 'helpful', 'alternating', 'Leslie', ""Sansone'sLeslie"", 'Sansone', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Walk', 'Deluxe', 'Edition', 'Fat', 'Burner', 'Walk', '2', 'Miles', '/', 'Fat', 'Burning', 'Walk', '4', 'Miles', 'other', 'day', 'course', 'ultimate', 'proof', 'help', 'least', 'weight', 'loss', 'stress', 'relief', 'blood', 'pressure', 'do', ""n't"", 'need', 'Nautilus', 'only', 'two', 'sets', 'hand', 'weights.The', 'main', 'issue', 'have', 'dvd', 'warm', 'up', 'routines', 'are', 'too', 'dancy', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'better', 'word', 'Modification', 'necessary', 'myself.If', 'someone', 'were', 'starting', 'exercise', 'program', 'dvd', 'good', 'start', 'long', 'time', 'fitness', 'buff', 'can', 'be', 'used', 'recovery', 'days']",15-Minute Workouts for Dummies
757680,A26KYDJOAGI05S,B00009V7PY,Audiaa,"[4, 4]","This series of 15 minute workouts is good for toning.  There is a section each for thighs, arms using hand weights, glutes which is mostly exercises on the floor, and abs.  Each session has a good warm up (better than most quick toning workouts) that lasts for about five minutes and actually increases my heart rate. The exercises are simple and easy to execute.  There are modifications to make them easier as well as harder though they usually just involve either using a chair or adding weights respectively.  The exercises are quite repetitive and do get a little boring, but they are effective.I found the little tips that come up on the screen using the icons like in a ""for dummies"" books somewhat annoying.  Then information was mostly obvious or at least things that I had heard before many times, and sometimes it comes up when I was doing exercises on the floor and had no real way to read it anyway.  I'm sure that part of the DVD will get annoying quickly, and once I learn the moves I'll listen to my own soundtrack.

The instructor routinely changes moves before she says what she is going to do. I found myself constantly trying to guess what was going to come next and then ended with less of a workout because I wasn't following it entirely. I constantly had the wrong arms or legs because she changes up so quickly and without notice. It's too late when your arms are already going up in the air to make then now go down at a seconds notice or to try and follow some seemingly random pattern of alternating moves. I did not like this video for that reason. She could have better explained what she was doing. I guess if you did this often enough then you would know the next move but this is supposed to be for dummies!

757686,A281NPSIMI1C2R,B00009V7PY,"Rebecca of Amazon ""The Rebecca Review""","[46, 46]","""Common don't quit!"" ~Gay GasperGay Gasper is an internationally known fitness presenter who loves exercise and has been teaching for over 19 years. She has appeared in 27 fitness workouts and has a high-energy style. Each movement has a purpose and she doesn't waste anytime between exercises. This is why I'm going to say this might be intermediate. If you have been exercising for a few months, and are familiar with the use of dumbbells then you might be ready for this workout.Some favorite features:15-minute Workouts for Abs, Arms, Buns and ThighsThe countdown clock - motivation to keep going to the last minuteAerobic sections between the weight lifting - This makes the workout feel like an interval training style workout. If you do all the exercises one after the other.Challenging modifications for advanced users - you can add weights at some point.Icons - Jargon alert, Myth Buster, Tips, Beware and Remember Icon.If you are looking for a nice challenge, you can do all the 15-minute workouts and make your way through all 26 toning and shaping exercises. If you want to take exercise breaks throughout the day or just want to spend 15 minutes each day - that is also an option.The tips were interesting and Gay gives advice like using a sponge mop for balance.The music is highly motivating, the set is uncluttered and Gay's personality and voice are pleasant and inspirational. She also uses humor throughout the exercises. Her professional attitude towards exercise makes you feel confident and you can really trust her advice.What will you need?A space large enough to do lungesTwo sets of weights.You could use 3-5 lb weights or even start with smaller weights and in a few weeks you will notice you are ready to move onto heavier weights. 3lb weights sounded right to me, but they say you can use two eight-pound dumbbells. It is better to work slowly into using weights and see gradual results. I started with one-pound weights and in about 30 weeks I was up to using 3-5lb weights. I no longer believe that faster is better. If it takes you 30 weeks to get to a point where you are really proud of yourself and you are keeping with an exercise program, then that beats a quick fix any day.15-Minute Workouts for Dummies might even become a staple in your exercise video collection. I loved it and will keep doing this workout because it is highly motivational and the exercises are very effective. You are increasing muscle that eventually helps you to burn more calories each day. If I am ever having trouble feeling motivated to exercise, I just put this video in the VCR and within minutes I'm in the mood to burn some calories.~The Rebecca ReviewP.S.
