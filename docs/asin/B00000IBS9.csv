502515,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00000IBS9,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[56, 59]","The descent into delusion and insanity is skillfully portrayed by Isabelle Adjani in this film that opens by stating that it is about &quot;events that really happened, and people who really existed&quot;.Set mostly in Halifax, beginning in 1863, the cinematography by Nestor Almendros is exquisite, with the camera lovingly capturing Adjani's gorgeous face. Using a somber palette, with occasional patches of brilliant red, it often has the look of an old painting, and the music of the early 20th century composer Maurice Jaubert fits in nicely.Francois Truffaut (who 19 minutes into the film makes a brief cameo appearance) tells this story with gentleness and sensitivity, keeping the pace flowing; though a rather gloomy tale, it never gets either depressing or boring. It shows what started out as love, with a resolution to bravely cross the ocean to be with her lover, become increasingly demented, from being a stalker, to debasing herself by her willingness to &quot;share&quot;, to the end, which takes place in Barbados. In the short and almost mute part of Baa, Madame Louise is a powerful and beautiful presence.Adjani won numerous awards for this 1975 film, and was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar (Louise Fletcher won for &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot;). Though the make-up is subtle and clever, it's her stellar performance that bring believability to this film.The historical photos and information in the final scene are fascinating, and make for a satisfying ending to another of Truffaut's great films, and one I have enjoyed seeing numerous times.",5,love and derangement,1042156800,"01 10, 2003",2003,1585,"['descent', 'delusion', 'insanity', 'skillfully', 'portrayed', 'Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'film', 'stating', 'quot', 'events', 'really', 'happened', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'existed', 'quot', 'mostly', 'Halifax', 'beginning', '1863', 'cinematography', 'Nestor', 'Almendros', 'exquisite', 'camera', 'lovingly', 'capturing', 'Adjani', 'gorgeous', 'face', 'Using', 'somber', 'palette', 'occasional', 'patches', 'brilliant', 'red', 'often', 'look', 'old', 'painting', 'music', 'early', '20th', 'century', 'composer', 'Maurice', 'Jaubert', 'nicely.Francois', 'Truffaut', 'who', '19', 'minutes', 'film', 'brief', 'cameo', 'appearance', 'story', 'gentleness', 'sensitivity', 'keeping', 'pace', 'flowing', 'rather', 'gloomy', 'tale', 'never', 'depressing', 'boring', 'what', 'started', 'out', 'love', 'resolution', 'bravely', 'cross', 'ocean', 'be', 'lover', 'become', 'increasingly', 'demented', 'being', 'stalker', 'debasing', 'willingness', 'quot', 'share', 'quot', 'end', 'place', 'Barbados', 'short', 'almost', 'mute', 'part', 'Baa', 'Madame', 'Louise', 'powerful', 'beautiful', 'presence.Adjani', 'won', 'numerous', 'awards', '1975', 'film', 'was', 'nominated', 'Best', 'Actress', 'Oscar', 'Louise', 'Fletcher', 'won', 'quot', 'One', 'Flew', 'Cuckoo', 'Nest', 'quot', 'make-up', 'subtle', 'clever', 'stellar', 'performance', 'bring', 'believability', 'film.The', 'historical', 'photos', 'information', 'final', 'scene', 'are', 'fascinating', 'make', 'satisfying', 'ending', 'Truffaut', 'great', 'films', 'one', 'have', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'numerous', 'times']",The Story of Adele H.

502516,A2CW9IQAPFEYLM,B00000IBS9,Bomojaz,"[10, 13]","Based on the true story about the obsessive love of Adele Hugo (daughter of Victor Hugo and played beautifully by Isabelle Adjani) for a French soldier (Albert Pinson, played by Bruce Robinson). Adele and Pinson were once lovers and even contemplated marriage, but her family would not consent at first so Pinson leaves - and eventually falls out of love. He joins the army and goes to Halifax, but Adele follows him.She tries everything to get him to love her again - in vain. She keeps a journal in which she fabricates a life for herself filled with success, where in reality there's only been failure. She slowly slips into madness. When Pinson is shipped to Barbados she even follows him there, living a beggars life in rags; she's totally insane now: she sees Pinson on the street one day and doesn't even recognize him anymore.Truffaut's brilliance here is not just in the way he develops and explores the passions that motivate and come to obsess Adele, which is moving and intelligent, but also in the way he's able to never allow our sympathies to desert her even though her obsession becomes totally irrational. Adjani is radiant at times as her face reveals the pain of her broken heart.

I am an avid Truffaut fan, but have not had the opportunity to watch this film.I must say that it does not come off as a truly 'Truffaut' film.  The acting is good, actually very good at certain points.  It just plays like a very good period piece, which it is.The film actually centers around the true story of Adele Hugo, daughter of Victor Hugo.  She flees her family's estate on Guernsey for Halifax, Nova Scotia, following her former lover.  She is obsessed with the man and her obsession becomes (or is a result from) a form of her inherent madness.  The film takes us over several years of her life.It is interesting that the film is so touching.  We see that the young man had previously duped Adele with promises of marriage in order to 'lie with her'.  This traumatized young Adele and she wanted nothing in the world but for the young man to marry her.  She begins furiously writing a journal (which is how we now know that what happened was truth).  Though she originally disguises her identity, it soon becomes apparent to the people around her who she really is.Overall the story is history, but also shows a woman's slow descent into madness.  What starts as an obsession quickly deepens into a severe emotional collapse.  Adele is so likable at times, yet we see this progression and feel sorry for her instead of feeling cynical.The film is rather good, though I probably won't pick it up to watch a second time.",4,"Not one of Truffaut's better films, but still worthy of viewing~",1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,1504,"['just', 'watched', 'film', 'last', 'night', 'spotting', 'local', 'library', 'am', 'avid', 'Truffaut', 'fan', 'have', 'not', 'had', 'opportunity', 'watch', 'film.I', 'must', 'say', 'not', 'come', 'off', 'truly', ""'Truffaut"", 'film', 'acting', 'good', 'actually', 'very', 'good', 'certain', 'points', 'just', 'very', 'good', 'period', 'piece', 'film', 'actually', 'centers', 'true', 'story', 'Adele', 'Hugo', 'daughter', 'Victor', 'Hugo', 'family', 'estate', 'Guernsey', 'Halifax', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'following', 'former', 'lover', 'obsessed', 'man', 'obsession', 'result', 'form', 'inherent', 'madness', 'film', 'several', 'years', 'life.It', 'interesting', 'film', 'so', 'touching', 'see', 'young', 'man', 'had', 'previously', 'duped', 'Adele', 'promises', 'marriage', 'order', ""'lie"", 'traumatized', 'young', 'Adele', 'wanted', 'nothing', 'world', 'young', 'man', 'marry', 'furiously', 'writing', 'journal', 'how', 'now', 'know', 'what', 'happened', 'was', 'truth', 'originally', 'identity', 'soon', 'apparent', 'people', 'who', 'really', 'is.Overall', 'story', 'history', 'also', 'woman', 'slow', 'descent', 'madness', 'What', 'obsession', 'quickly', 'severe', 'emotional', 'collapse', 'Adele', 'so', 'likable', 'times', 'see', 'progression', 'feel', 'sorry', 'instead', 'feeling', 'cynical.The', 'film', 'rather', 'good', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'pick', 'up', 'watch', 'second', 'time']",The Story of Adele H.

502520,ABN5K7K1TM1QA,B00000IBS9,Dennis Littrell,"[9, 10]","Isabelle Adjani plays the title role, that of Adele Hugo, daughter of the great French writer, a woman obsessively in love with an English army lieutenant who doesn't want her.  The scene is Halifax, Nova Scotia, during the time of the American Civil War.  She has followed Lt. Pinson (Bruce Robinson) from her home in exile on the island of Guernsey to be with him even though he has rejected her.  Adjani's sensuous beauty and her intense and passionate nature command the screen and we are drawn to identify with her as she spirals toward madness as her abject pleas of love are unrequited.  We watch as she debases herself in every way possible in a desperate attempt to gain Pinson's love, even to the point of giving him to other women.  She is psychologically pleased with this because she thinks it shows that her love for him transcends sexuality. Of course the nature of obsessive love is always entirely selfish.  If you really love someone who doesn't want you, you have to let them go.  But of course she cannot.Francois Truffaut directed and did a fine job of getting the most out of his young star.  The maddening nature of obsession is well depicted and the story is focused and unfolds at a deliberate pace.  Noteworthy is the setting itself, a cold and remote clime so that Adele is in isolation from her home, family and friends with little to do or think about every day except her obsession.  It is easy to see how something like this can lead to complete madness.Memorable is a little story within the larger tale, that of the fraudulent hypnotist whom Adele thinks might be able to turn Pinson's indifference into love.",4,A story of obsessive love,991526400,"06 3, 2001",2001,1642,"['Isabelle', 'Adjani', 'title', 'role', 'Adele', 'Hugo', 'daughter', 'great', 'French', 'writer', 'woman', 'obsessively', 'love', 'English', 'army', 'lieutenant', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'scene', 'Halifax', 'Nova', 'Scotia', 'time', 'American', 'Civil', 'War', 'followed', 'Lt.', 'Pinson', 'Bruce', 'Robinson', 'home', 'exile', 'island', 'Guernsey', 'be', 'even', 'rejected', 'Adjani', 'sensuous', 'beauty', 'intense', 'passionate', 'nature', 'command', 'screen', 'are', 'drawn', 'identify', 'madness', 'abject', 'pleas', 'love', 'are', 'unrequited', 'watch', 'way', 'possible', 'desperate', 'attempt', 'gain', 'Pinson', 'love', 'even', 'point', 'giving', 'other', 'women', 'psychologically', 'pleased', 'love', 'sexuality', 'course', 'nature', 'obsessive', 'love', 'always', 'entirely', 'selfish', 'really', 'love', 'someone', 'who', ""n't"", 'want', 'have', 'let', 'go', 'course', 'can', 'not', '.Francois', 'Truffaut', 'directed', 'did', 'fine', 'job', 'getting', 'most', 'young', 'star', 'maddening', 'nature', 'obsession', 'well', 'depicted', 'story', 'focused', 'unfolds', 'deliberate', 'pace', 'Noteworthy', 'setting', 'cold', 'remote', 'clime', 'Adele', 'isolation', 'home', 'family', 'friends', 'little', 'do', 'think', 'day', 'obsession', 'easy', 'see', 'how', 'something', 'can', 'lead', 'complete', 'madness.Memorable', 'little', 'story', 'larger', 'tale', 'fraudulent', 'hypnotist', 'whom', 'Adele', 'might', 'be', 'able', 'turn', 'Pinson', 'indifference', 'love']",The Story of Adele H.

Pawl ""Dani""","[0, 0]","Francois Truffaut is one of my favorite French directors, to date, and has a real knack for storytelling and bringing a great energy to his actors and the stories they recount through their screen personas. The Story of Adele H. is no different from his other pieces (including Four Hundred Blows, Small Change, and Day for Night). Isabel Adjani is luminous in her role of the title character, Adele H., daughter of famed writer Victor Hugo. The young woman follows her lover to Halifax, Canada from her home in France, where she resides with her parents. Her lover (Bruce Robinson) is a hopeless cad and, all in all, quite a jerk. ""Not worth the dirt on the bottom of her shoe"" as my mother would say. In fact, he insists that Adele return back to her home because he has nothing to offer her nor does Halifax. Of course, love is blind and deaf (at times). Adele persists and travels into the realm of delusion in order to secure monies from her father to be wired from Europe to Canada for the duration of her stay. The lies get more elaborate as the story progresses. She claims that she and her lover are engaged and even married in a church wedding. All the while, he is off making it with all of his mistresses and hoping Adele leave.Chillingly, this story is actually based on real events. Adele really existed and this harrowing tale really happened. As viewer, I feel drawn into her story within moments of the first frames. Isabel Adjani and the cast are absolutely terrific. The cold, wintry mornings in Halifax are beautifully depicted. The cinematography feels almost muddy at times.

It manages to make the cut because of great direction, cinematography, costumes, sets, locations, and most of all because of Isabelle Adjani's great and haunting performance, a performance for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for best actress and an award she should have won but which she lost to Louise Fletcher for ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST. She portrays the daughter of Victor Hugo, Adele Hugo (hence the H in the title). The story is based on true events which were recorded in a diary the real Adele kept. Adele falls in love with a soldier she met in France and soon after he leaves her and goes to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The movie begins by showing us Adele arriving in Nova Scotia and from then on we see her try to win her love back but he reveals he had no serious intentions with her and she becomes obsessed with getting him back. She has little pride and dignity and she does what she has to do to get him back and we see her suffer and through journal entries and letters we understand what she is going through psychologically.

But at the time Truffaut's decision to cast the young French theatre star was very risky.  Not because there was any doubt about Adjani's acting, but because casting someone who was arguably the most beautiful actress in the world as a character driven mad by unrequited love raised a potential credibility issue.  Would viewers believe that the advances of a woman so beautiful, passionate, and intelligent were rejected?  And could someone like that elicit sympathy from the average viewer.But Truffaut knew what he was doing because Adjani's Adele Hugo is 100% convincing.  And rather than going for  audience sympathy they go for audience frustration as the viewer is increasingly exasperated over Adele's self-destructive behavior.  Adjani's breathtaking beauty actually is an asset as Truffaut wants you convinced that the world offers unlimited possibilities for Adele if only she can let go of her obsession.  Adjani plays the character with such intensity that you are finally relieved when Adele's madness has reached the stage where she is no longer aware of her own suffering.Apparently Adele had other issues before going on her obsessive quest for love.  Her sister drowned a few years before and her parents had always strongly favored her sister.  Adele has recurrent nightmares about drowning.  Marriage and her pursuit of Pinson are her only way to escape from her famous father. Truffaut's stays with blacks, browns, and blues; with much of each frame filled with shadows; not exactly dreary but consistent with a character who has found little non-fantasy happiness during her life.The camera loves Adjani, a good thing as she is on screen for over 90% of the film.  She was the youngest nominee ever for best actress.  It was the best performance of the 1970's, probably no one but Adjani could have conveyed such inner emotional violence.  It is that extremely rare visual performance that does not need subtitles or even sound.As Roger Ebert noted:  ""Truffaut finds a certain nobility in Adele. He quotes one of the passages in her diaries twice: She writes that she will walk across the ocean to be with her lover. He sees this, not as a declaration of love, but as a statement of a single-mindedness so total that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. Adele was mad, yes, probably - but she lived her life on such a vast and romantic scale that it's just as well Pinson never married her. He would have become a disappointment"".Then again, what do I know?

502534,A2R1GFS6P1PC18,B00000IBS9,Peter Baklava,"[0, 0]","""The Story of Adele H"" is one of Francois Truffaut's best movies, although the brilliance of his direction here will forever take second place to the stunning beauty of Isabel Adjani.  Indeed, it's been said that Truffaut, during the making of the movie, was more an observer of Adjani's great performance than the director of it.And the entire movie revolves around the beautiful nineteen-yr.-old actress.  This is perhaps the best of Truffaut's cache of movies dealing with outsiders.  Adele Hugo is the epitome of a fallen Romantic--that is, a sympathetic and intelligent figure who seems to be caught in a maelstrom of destruction, at the hands of her own emotions.  The madness that drives her intense obsession with a beautiful but callow French lieutenant is beyond understanding.Though she has pushed herself to the end of her tether in traveling to Nova Scotia, where she faces only the battering of further rejection, she remains an oddly heroic figure--perhaps sort of a parallel to Tolstoi's Anna Karenina.  She sacrifices everything for love.Though for most of the movie things continually go from bad to worse, Truffaut does in the end lift the story out of the morass of complete doom and haplessness--for which I felt grateful, I must admit.  Ms. Hugo's dignity was not totally shredded, and the movie is not a total exercise in cruelty.  The manner of her redemption, in Barbados, at the hands of a black woman, carries a touch of irony.Visually the movie is a complete feast, with painterly cinematography only adding to Adjani's incredible physical beauty.
