Michael Madsen lent his name to this project and his presence in the film. Thanks Michael. This film is not a horror film. It's a thriller with an ending that will really surprise you. If I was the editor, I'd have made the ending the beginning. If you're confused at the end just wind back and watch the, approximately five minute, ending again. Then you'll get it. The movie moves at a slow pace showing an unsympathetic female character who prostitutes herself and is addicted to drugs be kidnapped and held hostage. The ending is the only reason to watch this movie. I slept through my first viewing. Fast forwarded to the end and immediately felt engaged with the story and the characters.

I then called several people I know and told them they just had to watch this movie.The movie weaves in and out of showing background and flashback, building in a logical progression.  The main character is a single women with two children, she is struggling with inner city poverty, drugs (use and a selling con), bad relationships, health, and the legal system.  Rest easy, not to much time is spent on this background though it is a major segment which you continue to get glimpses of as the story unwinds.She gets abducted by an older man, ironically named &#34;Justice&#34; and is forced into a new survival game, one where she has to actively participate for not just her life but the life of others who have also been abducted - all with some sin (perceived or otherwise) that they have to answer for.  The other half of the story is her telling her story of abduction and the events that occurred to social case worker who has to decide if she is crazy, or guilty of murder.  As she is alive and in the hospital you already know that she somehow has escaped, but how is the question the movie builds on.The other unfortunates that are being held have somehow passed into the second phase of their punishment by Mr. Justice - having passed out of his favor and into little holding coffins in covered graves - a large pipe acting as the breathing tube which also serves as the way to talk back and forth as well as be provided food and water.  Their stories are given, their pleas heard, their fates decided as a part of the plot but not a lot of details or flashbacks.Overall this is a well thought out script, the dialog is very believable, the conclusion you will not see coming.  Caution - when you think the movie has ended (it is at a logical point) the screen goes dark for just a few seconds but do not stop watching as their is just a few minutes left that suddenly opens an entirely new plot twist.For the &#34;logic&#34; buffs, some questions from within the movie are not answered in a nice tidy package, nor should they be, though none are important enough to take away from the plot - just enough to keep you wondering.  The &#34;end&#34; tosses in some additional questions but not as distractions - more toward making you think up intricate mind explorations on your own.For me, this is going to be one movie I continue to recommend and watch again.

1660781,A2AN5WDTIQSLWU,B00DS79H1U,Blue Leaf,"[23, 30]","I decided to rate this film and write a review because this is definitely NOT a five-star film.  It is a good amateurish film with some mediocre acting and a storyline that ,without giving away the ending, is rather confusing.  The main character is a drug addicted, mother of two young children, who is on welfare and and sells drugs and herself to get by.  The film begins with her incarcerated for crimes we are not sure of and then flashes back to allow us to understand why and how she ended up the way she did.The biggest problem I had with the film was the character development.  At no time did I ever have any feelings, good or bad, for the female lead.  This made me feel somewhat apathetic to the dilemma she finds herself in.  I believe if her character had been more developed and complex it would have dramatically increased my involvement in her outcome.I believe, since I have never heard of the director and most of the cast, with the exception of Michael Masdsen, that this was made by a group of novice individuals.  I found it to be somewhat entertaining and I feel with more experience the director and the main actress can have a good future in films.

Why did the detective not follow up on Linda's account if three other women gave the same bizarre account of treatment?
